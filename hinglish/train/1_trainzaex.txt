 'my father was a statesman, i am a political woman
 mere pita ek sant the, lekin main nahin
 These words of Indira Gandhi reflect her courageous character, which she often used to overthrow political opponents
 lekin congress ke taaja netritv ke mizaaj main vah baat nahin
 There is always a sense of renunciation in Rahul Gandhi
 loksabhaa or kai rajyon main haar ke baad congress ab dilli main bhi sarender karne ja rahi he
 After understanding some similarities between the Congress of 1977 and the current Congress, we will know what was done by Indira Gandhi at that time, which is not impossible for Rahul Gandhi to do now? Both the Congress governments for ten years were chaotic After the conditions, Indira Gandhi imposed Emergency in the country in 1975
 kai logon ko jail main daal diya gaya
 Most of his political opponents were in this
 haal hi main gai upie sarkaar ke aakhri teen varshon main ek ke baad ek ghotaale saamne aae or sarkaar ke sahyogiyon main khinchataan charam par pahunch gai
 On both occasions, the public felt the most hurt
 tab haar ke baavjood desh ke raajnneetik patal par indira gandhi hi sabase badi netaa thim
 She stood
 unhen immergency ke dauraan hue atyaachaar ke maamle main giraftaar karne police pahunchi to ve apane ghar ke baahar hi jameen par baith gayi
 When that picture came out in the newspapers, people being sympathetic towards her as a woman
 uske baad to indira har mudde par janata sarkaar se loha lene lageen
 But Rahul Gandhi's case is another
 congress ke netritv vaali upie sarkaar hone ke baavjood unhone kabhi khud ko congress netritv ke rup main aage nahin kiya
 He would make statements on some issues and take mysterious silence on many
 janata main hameshaa yah shankaa rahi ki ve raajnneeti main dilchaspee rakhte bhi hai yaa nahin
 Indira Gandhi, who was in a mood of rest, lost power in 1977 when Indira Gandhi lost power in 1977
 lekin vipaksh main rahete hue unhone janata sarkaar main shaamil netaaon kii mahatvakankshaon par najar banaae rakhi
 Stimulate it so that the government can provoke contradictions
 ve safal raheen
 The government fell in two years
 chunaav hue or ve dobaaraa satta main lautin
 But after the tenure of the UPA government, Rahul Gandhi is in a relaxed mood
 dharmantaran jaise kai mudde hai, lekin ve front par nahin aae hai
 When Indira lost power, her anger was clearly visible in them
 unhone party ko jode rakhaa or use haunsala diya ki ve jaldi hi chunaav main jaaenge or phir sarkaar main aaenge
 In contrast, after ten years of UPA government, the Congress is now looking in a relaxed mood
 loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baad to uskaa netritv maharashtra, haryana, jammu-kashmir or jharkhand jaise rajyon ke chunaav prachaar se bhi lagbhag nadaarad rahaa
 Despite the defeat, the Congress remained one, now missed the opportunity to unite the opposition
 During the Emergency, many questions were raised about the role of the government and Sanjay Gandhi, but the authority of Indira Gandhi remained within the Congress
 is ekta ke aage sarkaar main shaamil dalon ke bich bikharaav dikhne laga, jo baad main badhata hi gaya
 In the current era, opposition parties also have an 'anti-modi' agenda, but the Congress has failed to provide them a platform
 tab taanaashaahee or bhrashtachar ke aarope sahane vaali indira gandhi hi pramukh vipaksh thim, jabaki ab rahul gandhi dur-dur tak kahin nahin hai

 One faction is headed by Praveen Gaikwad and they are in a position to maintain the current condition, while another section led by Manoj Akhade wants to launch Sambhaji Brigade as a full-fledged political party
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki rajya kalyaan ayukta aane vaale hafton main is vivadaper faisla sunaayenge
 Purushottam Khedekar, a former state government employee (12 per cent of the state government employees are by chance), started the Sambhaji Brigade two decades ago
 iskaa ghoshit uddeshy 'brahmanvaadi takaton ke khatre ke khilaaf (maraathon ke bich) jaagrukta paidaa karnaa' tha
 During these years, the organization took an aggressive stand on many issues

 It also objected to the poet Babasaheb Purandare — who is a Brahmin — being awarded the state's highest Maharashtra Bhushan Award in 2015

 ek samay main desh kaa sabase bada anathalay aaj khud anaath ho gaya
 Alam is that the orphanage is shedding tears on its plight
 koi iske aansu ponchney vaala nahin he
 How many orphan children from Darbhanga's Shri Kameshwari Priya Poor Home stood on their feet due to good upbringing
 lekin vahi shri kameshwari priya pur home aaj gandi raajnneeti kaa shikaar ho gaya he
 Despite the order of Bihar Human Rights Commission, a private hospital is being run in this orphanage, not keeping orphaned children
 darbhanga ke jiladhikari bhi is maamle main chup baithe hai
 The commission has given a clear order to the District Magistrate of Darbhanga to start an orphanage without delay
 lekin teen saal biit jane ke baavjood abhi sthiti jas kii tas bani hui he
 Darbhanga Maharaj had built the orphanage in memory of his wife Shahjahan built Taj Mahal in memory of his wife but Darbhanga Maharaja himself
 kameshwar singh ne apni patni kii yaad main 1940 main ek anathalay kii neenv rakhi
 The name of that Annalaya was Shri Kameshwari Priya Poor Home
 darbhanga maharaj ne apni patni shri kameshwari priya ke asamayik nidhan ke baad anathalay banane kaa faisla liya tha
 This orphanage was formally started two years later in 1942
 is anathalay ko darbhanga ke dil main 5 acre jameen par bade hi susajjit dhang se banaaya gaya
 Darbhanga Maharaj had a sincere wish that the children, who have no one to take care of them, should get good care in this hospital
 vah aage chalakar apane pairon par khadaa ho sake
 During the lifetime of Darbhanga Maharaj, hundreds of children brought up from Shri Kameshwari Priya Poor Home and found a new place in life
 anathalay khud hi anaath ho gayalekin shri kameshwari priya pur home kii ulti ginati saal 1962 se shuru ho gai
 After the death of Darbhanga Maharaja Sir Kameshwar Singh, this orphanage was occupied by people who threw water on the wishes of Darbhanga Maharaj
 shri kameshwari priya pur home swaarthee logon kaa shikaar ho gaya
 The result was that this orphanage itself was orphaned for 35 years

 mumbai main hue hamalon ne yah dikhaa diya he ki desh kii suraksha vyavastha main kis kadar khamiyaan hai or usamen kis kadar ghun laga hua he
 Regardless of intelligence agencies' failure to get to the bottom and prevent attacks through clues, casualties are incapable of immediate and effective deterrence in case of casualties at the start of the attack, helplessly watching the spectacle Whether the city police are under-trained and under-armed, or they are non-effective laws that instead of stopping terrorists in reality They create courage, it is so clear that the security system needs complete metamorphosis
 pahunch ke lihaaj se mumbai kaa hamalaa abhootpurv tha or usne bhartiya rajya ke adhikaar ko sidhi chunauti di
 There have been three major attacks of this kind in recent history
 pehla 2001 main desh kii sansad par hua akraman tha, doosraa san 2002 main akshardham mandir ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya tha or teesraa july, 2005 main ayodhya main ramalala kii pratimaa par hamalaa karnaa tha
 Though there has been an increase in cowardly blasts in crowded areas in terms of numbers and reach, the above four attacks were such that there was an ability to inflame the attacks within the country
 un sabhi kii yojana bade karine se banaai gai thi or unamem atyant abhiprerit aatankwaadi shaamil the, jinhen commando ke rup main prashikshan diya gaya tha
 He probably rehearsed the attack several times with the help of some local supporters
 iske baavjood desh kii suraksha vyavastha ke jimmedaar logon, khaskar uski anek guptchar agenciyon, ne pichley aatankwaadi hamalon se koi sabak nahin siikhe lagate hai
 This led to the tragedy of Mumbai
 guptchari main vruddhi karenhaalanki ek-duusare par doshaaropan jari he, lekin hakeekat yahi he ki hamalaa hua tha or khufia reporton par amal nahin kiya gaya
 The three top intelligence intelligence systems - the Intelligence Bureau (IB) responsible for internal intelligence, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in charge of external intelligence, and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) - operate mostly independently and do not cooperate with each other Huh
 unamem samanvay sthapit karne or khufia reporton ko saajha karne ke liye do saal pehle bahu-agency samanvay samiti (emesisi) ke gathan kiye jane ke baavjood adhikari sweekaar karte hai ki yah vyavastha kargar nahin he

 "it is shocking that no joint control command was set up to counter the attack in Mumbai," says Malik
 naukarshahi kii banaai louh deevaaron ko gira diya janaa chahie
 Instead, there should be rapid exchange of intelligence reports on the lower scale, in which they are assessed at various levels
 ''ro ke purv pramukh or 2001 main guptchari main sudhaaron par report prastut karne vaali samiti ke adhyaksh rahe girishchandra saxena kaa kahana tha ki uski zyaadaatar siforishein 'vichaaradhin' bani raheen
 Among other things, Saxena's report recommended that at least 30,000 employees should be deployed in field duty at IB, the country's premier intelligence agency
 lekin vaastavik tathy stabdh kar dene vaale hai
 The total number of employees in the IB is 25,000, of which one-third are drivers, peons and administrative and secretarial staff
 field duty vaale karmchaariyon kii sankhya mahaj 3,500 he, jinamein se zyaadaatar rajnatik guptchari main tainaat hai

 The amount of jahaan aatankwaadi apane kaamkaaj ke tareekon or istemaal karne vaali praudyogiki ko badalte rahete hai, vahiin guptchar adhikari soch ke apane puraane tareekon se chipke hai
 State intelligence branches across the country, which are generally used to gather political intelligence in favor of ruling parties, continued to operate on the same pattern of olden times, increasing chronic blindness
 nateeja yah he ki unhone chetavaniyon kii parvaah kerani bhi chhod di
 a committee constituted to strengthen intelligence in the states, whose members are the Director General of Police of Maharashtra, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Assam and Uttar Pradesh, has not met even once in the last two years
 punjab police ke guptchari pramukh suresh aroda kehete hai, ''kisi manyata yaa inaam ke abhaav main is samay police mahakme main guptchari ko koi poochne vaala nahin he
 There is a dire need for revolutionary solutions to enable intelligence agencies to work effectively and together
 kuch visheshgy to shikhar par yani khaskar narayanan kii bhoomika se hi sudhaar shuru kiye jane kii vakaalat karte hai
 They still have the burden of dealing with both external and internal threats and perhaps they do not have the time to pay the required attention to both
 duusare log pramukh sanrachanaatmak badlaavon kii jarurat bataate hai, jinamein ek aise rashtriya guptchar evam suraksha praadhikaran kaa gathan shaamil he, jiske paas guptchari, aatank virodh or jaanch main lagi agenciyon ke bich samanvay sthapit karne ke liye salaahkaar kii bhoomika hi nahin kaaryakari shaktiyaan bhi hon
 It also includes having a separate intelligence service on the scale of the country like IAS and IPS
 kuch or log grih mantralay ko ek brihad swadesh suraksha mantralay main badal dene kaa suzav dete hai, jiske paas is kadar vyapak adhikaar hon jisase guptchar, avrajan, seemaa shulk or tatarakshakon samet sabhi agenciyon ko iske adheen laayaa ja sake
 Each option has its own disadvantages
 un par bahes karwaakar tatkaal amal kiya janaa chahie
 Stricter Hathman Mohan is pushing for a more restrained Central Investigation Agency to look into cases with inter-state implications and affecting internal security
 grih mantralay isko lekar pehle hi ek aise praaroop par kaam kar rahaa he, jiskaa makasad mukhya taur par 1980 ke rashtriya suraksha kanoon main sanshodhan karnaa he
 The format envisages a National Security Authority, which will be responsible for carrying out and monitoring all forms of terrorism related crimes across the country
 is praadhikaran main ek adhyaksh ke antargat paanch sadsy honge or vah abhiyukton par mukadmaa bhi chalaaegaa
 Each state will have a security commissioner - preferably, an IPS officer holding a high position - who will be directly accountable to the authority
 praaroop main jamaanat ko lekar kade praavdhaanon ke alaava drut gati vaali adaalaton or mrityu dand ke praavdhaan bhi rakhe gaye hai or isamen sarkaar ko aatankwaad ke aaropee kisi vyakti or uske khule tathaa chhipe samarthakon evam praayojakon kii sampattiyon ke saath-saath uske bank khaaton ko jam karne kii bhi vyavastha kii gai he
 It also provides punishment for persons found guilty of depositing or sponsoring money for terrorist acts, conspiring with them, sheltering them or threatening witnesses
 lekin rajyon ne iskaa kadaa virodh kiya he, jinka kahana he ki isse unke adhikaron (kanoon-vyavastha rajya kaa vishay he) kaa atikaraman hota he
 The Mumbai attacks have added a sense of readiness to the process
 isliye ukt praaroop ko jaldi hi anumodan ke liye cabinet ke saamne rakhaa jayega, jiske baad sarkaar sansad ke aagaamee satr main ek vidheyak pesh karegi yaa phir vah isse sambandhit adhyadesh bhi laa sakati he
 Some others want the existing laws to be made more sharper and some provisions of the anti-terrorism law (POTA) which has been repealed by the UPA government be revoked
 yah sach he ki pota or maharashtra main iske pratirupon kaa ghor durupyog ho saktaa he
 This can be done especially against the target community
 vivaad mukhya rup se sandigdhon ko kuch samay tak-maujuuda kanoon ke tahat 24 ghante or prastaavit kanoon ke tahat kai maah-hawalat main band karne ke praavdhaan ko lekar he or is baat ko lekar bhi ki police ke samaksh ikbaalia bayaan adaalaton main maanya rakhe jaaen yaa nahin
 Some advocate terrorism-related crimes to be dropped from the state list to the federal or concurrent list
 varisht police adhikariyon kaa tark he ki samvidhan kii suchi main is parivartan se aatankwaad ke khilaaf kadaa kanoon laayaa ja sakegaa, jisamen aaj ke mukaable adhik kadi sajaaen di ja sakengi or naagarik adhikaron ke hanan ko lekar ho-hallaa machaane vaale samoohon ko aade nahin aane diya jayega
 To deal with situations where a person like Afzal Guru, who has been sentenced to death for terrorist offenses, postpones his sentence, experts suggest amending the law to remove Rahm's provisions
 mumbai main aatanki hamalon ne rajya police kii ikaayiyon kii shochaneey sthiti par se bhi paradaa hataaya he
 His anti-terrorism Squad (ATS) functions in the same manner as the Investigation Branch and does not have a special squad like Special Weapons and Tactics (swat)
 police ke paas to enesji ke commando tukdi ke pahunchane se pehle aatankwaadiyon ko roke rakhane tak kii bhi kshamta nahin thi or ghabrahat main ai rajya sarkaar ko iske liye nausena ke marine commando bulaane pade the
 The NSG commando contingent at Manesar in Haryana arrived in Mumbai more than six hours late
 use pehle to dilli hawaii adde tak pahunchane ke liye gadiyon main aana padaa, kyonki uske helicopter raat ko udaan nahin bhar sakate
 He waited for the IL-76 aircraft, believed to be ready to stand 24 hours, which was in distant Chandigarh
 jab yah vimaan mumbai main utraa or enesji ke commando ladaai vaale ilaake tak pahunchane ke liye antat sarkari bason main savaar hue to teen thikaanon se aatankwaadiyon kaa safaya karne main do din se adhik samay lag gaya
 Some of his soldiers also had a severe lack of equipment
 manushya rahit sainik vimaanon or chalyman kaman chaukiyon jaisi badi-badi chizon kii to baat hi chhodie, uske javaanon ko bulatopruf jacket or belastic helmet jaisi buniyadi jaruraton ke bina hi ladanaa padaa
 a few minutes before boarding the flight to Delhi, the Black Cat commandos were frantically requesting phones to be sent to ballistic helmets at the airport
 israel sthit international policy centre for counter-teror ke karnal (ritred) jonathan fighel kehete hai, ''dhaava bolne vaale jawan aatankwaad virdohi vishesh chizon-vastra, nite vijan, lager veuphinder, belastic shield, sanchaar vyavastha vaale helmaton-se las nahin the
 "the metropolitan police system is clear, the need is for Indian metros to end their dependence on the massive force of the Home Ministry, such as the NSG, which is camping near the capital
" yah 1980 vaale dashak ke dauraan punjab or jammu-kashmir main bagawaton ke jamaane kii vyavastha he
 The number of these specially trained and equipped with special weapons is not more than 100 and such a force needs to be formed in every metropolis of the country like a fire brigade, which is always ready in commando operations and hostage situations
 are
 use yuddh main tape sainikon ke centre ke irdagird gathit kiya janaa chahie, jiske javaanon ko vishesh sainik prashikshan mila ho or jo 24 ghante chaukas rahe

 And then the police forces of most cities, except for such emergencies, are also unable to deal with simple crimes
 ausatan prati ek lakh aabaadi par 126 pulicekarmi hai
 In developed countries this ratio is between 300 and 500 policemen per one lakh population
 prati-aatankwaad visheshgy or institute for kancelict management ke kaaryakari nideshak ajay saahani kehete hai, ''agar aap pulicekarmiyon kii shiksha or prashikshan se sambandhit gunvattta ko dekhen to police is prakaar ke aatankwaadi hamalon ko roak paane ke liye katai las nahin he
 In the 21st century, you have a cop soaking sticks
 aap 19veen sadi ke police bal ke saath 21veen sadi ke khatre se nibatane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 There are other areas that need to be reformed immediately
 punjab ke purv police mahanideshak kanvarpal singh gil kehete hai, ''zyada khatre vaale shaharon main police thanon ko apgrade karke unhen aatankwaad virdohi daston ke hawaale kar diya janaa chahie or aatankwaadi hamale kii sthiti main sabase pehle ve hi usase nibatane ke liye aage aaen
 Their response to combating urban terrorism should be ordered in such a way that they are ready within one to three minutes
 ''or phir, jaise ki sibiai ke purv nideshak joginder singh kehete hai, ''jis aatankwaad se hamaara muqabla he, vah is kadar teevr or aadhunik hathiyaaron se las he ki maanviya sansadhano or praudyogiki se viheen hamaare suraksha tantra par haaavee hone kii usamen kshamta he
 There are 50,000 close circuit televisions in New York City alone, even in mosques
 samast desh main bhi hamaare paas saarvajanik sthalon par itane close circuit tivi camere nahin hai
 Experts suggest that since terrorist attacks can take place in large metros of the country, there is a need to adopt and implement the notion of policing in big cities
 aisi vyavastha jisamen har shahar aise polisajanon kaa behad surakshit kila ban jaae jinke paas apni enesji ikai, ucch kism kaa guptchar tantra or nigaraanee ke upkaran hon
 That is, in short, it should be a world class force
 jaahir he, agar bharat ko aatank ke khatre se kargar dhang se nibatna he to bahut kuch kiya janaa baaki he
 Laws and surveillance systems need to be put in place to control the sale of sensitive chemicals that can be used in the manufacture of explosives
 yahi nahin, aatankwaad ke liye paison ke gaiyrkanoonee stroton kii jaanch or us par shikanja kasne ke liye ek kargar agency kii bhi darkaar he
 And there is also a need to bring more accountability in the system if there is a big security lapse
 utana hi mahatvapurn prati-aatankwaadi falsafe kaa vikaas he
 This includes conducting military operations against terrorists and winning the hearts of the people of the affected areas
 aatankwaad ke mukaable ke liye uske viruddh teen mahatvapurn tatwon ko apnaanaa hoga-parinaamon kaa prabandhan, prati-aatankwaad or khufiagiri
 The country will have to immediately take the path of reforms in the system
 kaary yojana-aatank par koi raham nahinkanoon main sanshodhan kar pakkaa karnaa ki hatyaron ko koi raham na mili
 Establish a home security department of home security
 aatank virdohi kanoonpota jaise kade kanoon laana, jinamein uske durupyog ko rokane kaa praavdhaan ho

 Former Australia captain Steve Smith, who returned to the Test team from the Ashes series after facing a ban on ball tampering last year, started the feat
 ashes shrinkhalaa main smith ke jabardast pradarshan kii har koi tarif karata thak nahin rahaa
 According to this performance, according to the latest ICC ranking, Smith has become the number one batsman in the Test
 smith ne siries main ab tak 134
 a total of 671 runs have been given away at an average of 20
 siries main khele teen maichon main smith ne teen shatak or do ardhashatak banaae hai
 Smith did not play the third match due to injury
 smith ke is shandaar pradarshan se unhone sab ke munh par taala jad diya he, jinhone bain ke baad un par sawaal uthaae the
 Smith has broken several records in this series
 ashes siries main smith ne lagaataar 9veen baar 50 ranon ke upar ran banane kaa record bana diya
 After which he became the first batsman to do so
 itnaa hi nahin, ashes siries main kisi match main teesri baar 250 ran ke upar kaa score banane kaa record banaaya, smith se pehle aisa koi bhi khilaadi nahin he jisane england main kheli gai siries main aisa karnama kiya ho
 Even though Smith missed his century in the fourth match, he could not miss his team to win the series
 smith ne pehali pari main 211 or duusari pari main 82 ran banaae
 Smith is a player who stands by his team all the time when needed
 team ko jab-jab jarurat padi, smith ne parform kiya he
 With this, Smith has come close to the record on the one hand
 yah teesraa mauka he jab smith ne test siries main 600 kaa aankada chuaa ho
 Prior to this, Don Bradman has scored more than 600 runs in 6 consecutive series
 smith kaa maujuuda form ko dekhne se aisa lag rahaa he ki vah breadman kaa record tod denge
 If he does so, Smith's name will be recorded forever in the history of cricket
 ponting kaa record todenge smithaustralia ke sabase safal captainon main se ek riki ponting ke naam kai record hai
 Smith has equaled Ponting's record due to a great performance
 ponting ne 10 baar kisi test match kii pehali pari main shatak or duusari pari main ardhashatak banaaya tha
 In the fourth Test match of the Ashes series, Smith has equaled Ponting's record by scoring a century in the first innings and a half-century in the second innings
 ab agar aane vaale test match main smith pehali pari main shatak or duusari pari main ardhashatak lagaate hai to wo ponting kaa yah record tod denge
 It is a different matter that former South African all-rounder Jack Kallis scored a century in the first innings and a half-century in the second innings in 11 consecutive Tests
 in tamaam recordon ko dekhte hue smith aaj kii taarikh main vishwa ke number ek ballebaaj maane jane vaale viraat kohli ko bhi peeche chhodte najar aa rahe hai
 One match of the Ashes series is yet to be played from September 12
 jaahir he, vishwa bhar main jin logon kaa dil cricket ke naam par dhadkaa karata he unki nigahen smith ke balle par hogi
 Hopefully, Smith's bat will speak once again

 madhubani railway stesan par vishwa kaa sabase badi painting banaai gai he
 The Madhubani painting, built in 7005 sq ft, has given Madhubani railway station a distinct identity
 lekin vishwa kii sabase bady painting hone ke baavjood is saal is painting kaa naam ginis book aanp verde ricard main darj nahin ho paaya
 These artists of Madhubani painting are blaming the railway authorities for this
 inhone verde ricard ke liye iskaa registration hi nahin karaayaa he
 Madhubani painting is ready in 7005 square feet thanks to Shramdaan
 parantu railway adhikariyon ke laaparvaahee ke kaaran madhubani ke 182 kalakaaron ko maayusi haath lagi he
 To make the dirtiest station in India clean, these artists did a day and night painting in such a large area, which is much more than the Guinness Book of World Records, but the railway authorities have only saved a few bucks for the Guinness Book
 The registration of this program was not done and when the painting is ready in 7005 square fit at Madhubani station, then the official registration process Dria talks about starting
 abhi tak ginis book of world recode main 4566
 The painting made in 1 square fit is the most area made painting
 samastipur ke diarem rabindra jain ne bataaya ki hamane ab registration kii prakriya shuru kar di he
 At the same time, the artists say that the railway officials have cheated us
 hamalogon ko bataaya gaya tha ki badhiya painting banane waalon ko puraskrit kiya jayega lekin teraa din kaa teraa sau rupee dekar thag liya
 Everyone is cheating Mithila painting artists
 vahiin, dasvin me padhane vaali shruti ne bataaya ki main das din kii padhai chhodkar yahaan apni mummy ke saath painting banane aayi hui thi taaki ham ginis book of world record me shaamil ho sake lekin aaj kaaphi maayusi ho rahi

 Why Shahid Shahid is so busy with films 'fabulous' and 'udta Punjab', he has found it difficult to find time for the film 'fake'

 According to the English newspaper 'mid Day', the director duo 'raj and DK' have decided after waiting for several months that Arjun Kapoor will be seen in his film 'fake' instead of Shahid

 yah sthapit manyata he ki senanayakon ko lade jane vaale yudhon kii prakruti se du:khee nahin hona chahie
 After the intense civil disobedience movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi in 1933, the contact between the Congress-led nationalist movement and the British Raj was completely severed
 uske baad jawaharlal nehru ne ek sawaal uthaa kar use anuttarit chhod diya tha, ''ham kiski swatantraaa ke liye prayatnsheel hai, kyonki rashtrawaad main to bahut se paap or virodhabhasi tatv bhi shaamil hai?''congress ke ek agrani netaa ke man main aatm-sanshay paidaa karne vaali yah baat bahut hairaan karne vaali bhi nahin he
 In 1933, Nehru was in his radical-reformist era and was deeply influenced by the socialist currents of Europe
 puri sambhaavna he ki unhone swatantraaa sangram ko aarthik shoshan or samrajyavad ke viruddh vyapak sangharsh ke ek hisse ke taur par dekha ho
 But the reality was not as revolutionary as he had expected
 jab mahatma gandhi ahimsa kaa prayog karte hue is sangharsh ko ram rajya ke liye nyaaypurna sangharsh ke rup main dekh rahe the, usee samay rashtrawaad kaa sandesh janata ke bich alag-alag tareekon se pahunch rahaa tha
 It was not only the question of whose freedom, but also what kind of freedom
 janata kii nigaah main mahatma gandhi aise sant the jo rajnatik netritv ko naitik bal ke saath mila rahe the
 Mahatma Gandhi was providing symbolic leadership
 isi ke saath, swatantraaa ke asli sangharsh ko bharat mata ko hajaaron saal kii daastaa se mukti ke yuddh ke rup main dekha ja rahaa tha
 The imagination of the nationalist movement — from 'vande Mataram' to the integration of Bharat Mata and go-mata — was clearly Hindu
 yah beesvin shatee kii shuruyaat se hi aisa tha jab aravindo ne rashtrawaad kii samanta sanathan dharm se kii thi or lokmaanya tilak ne ganesh tathaa shivaji utsavon ko ek saath jodate hue unhen swashaasan ke manchon main badal diya tha
 Historian William Goold wrote in a study of nationalist campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s, "religion helped to prepare and mobilize the necessary structure, location, discipline, and in the process the political meaning of 'hindutva' was refined in a Developed as an idea
 
 
 hindu logon ko bhartiya raashtra ke pratik ke rup main pesh kiya jaataa tha
 "this does not imply that India was seen as a land of Hindus — or what is today interpreted as Bharatvanshi religions —
 iskaa arth yah tha ki rashtriya str par saamanyat: bhartiya kaa aashay anivaaryat: hindu se tha—bahut deele-dhaale arth tathaa mukhya rup se saanskrithik bhav main
 It is expedient to recall this aspect of the Indian nationalist tradition in the context of a vigorous debate since the 1990s
 samakaleen 'dharmanirpeksh' vidwaanon ne yah dikhaane kaa prayaas kiya he ki ayodhya andolan ke saath shuru hui or varsh 2014 tathaa varsh 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main kuch had tak dikhaai padi mukhar hindu lamabandi swatantra desh ke rup main bharat ke udai ko aakaar dene vaale 'bharat ke vichaar' se bilkul alag or asambaddha he
 This is a matter of great debate
 kisi bhi sthiti main, is 'vichaar' ko alag-thalag rup main dekhnaa hi gahari samasya kaa kaaran he
 a large and diverse country like India had many streams
 gopal krishna gokhale jaise prabud samvidhanvaadee the jo mahasoos karte the ki swatantraaa se pehle saamaajik or rajnatik aadhuniktaa aani chahie
 They were concerned with the idea of unrestrained collective participation in politics
 usee kaal main kavi rabindranath tagore the jinka bharat kii lok paramparaon ke prati gaharaa prem tha, lekin unamem rashtrawaad ke prati gahari asweekruti or saarvbhaumik mulyon ke prati samarthan tha

 ambedkar jaise vichaarak bhi the jinka sara dhyaan saamaajik mukti par kendrit tha, vishesh rup se jati vyavastha ke unmoolan par
 The India which regained political sovereignty in 1947 was not born of any single concept or idea of nation
 isamen kai dharaaen, yahaan tak ki virodhabhasi bhi, shaamil thim
 Nehruvian consensusism dominated the intellectual world until 1990 was an important part of it
 usee tarah kaa hissaa hindu rashtrawaad bhi tha jo raajnneetik rup se sataha ke neeche kii dhara ke rup main tha lekin aam logon kii maansikta main uski sweekaaryata adhik thi
 Gandhi understood the importance of accepting all the streams together in a colorful manner and that is why he insisted that the first government of independent India had a b

 Notable non-congressmen like Ambedkar and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee should also be included
 aaj ke bharat main, kuch kshetron main yah dharna prachlit he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi aise rajnatik dakhsandaji karne vaale shaks hai, jinhone congress or anya 'dharmanirpeksh' takaton kii shithilataa or netritv kii kamiyon kaa laabh uthaate hue takat ke boote kendriya manch par jagah bana lee he
 Such an assumption is based on two assumptions questionable
 inamen se pehali galat manyata yah he ki swatantraaa-prapti ke baad ke bharat ke vimarsh kii sharten maano pathar kii lakeer hai jisamen 'vaigyanik soch' or sanvaidhanik sarvasammati donon sammilit hai
 Nehru wrote with astonishing conviction in his book An Autobiography in 1936, "the days of national cultures are rapidly ending and the world is turning into a single cultural entity
"

 In practice it meant that the legacy of Indian civilization may be important for showmanship, but it was secondary in the creation of modern India

 Hinduism accepted by Nehruists was esoteric spiritualism and higher philosophy; The vibrant Hindu faith, based on rituals and caste-based customs, had no place in the public life of modern India
 vastav main anushthanon or reeti-rivaajon par aadhaarit aasthaa ko pragati main baadhak hi mana jaataa tha
 There was another belief associated with this which later became known as 'constitutional patriotism'
 kaaphi had tak vishwa yuddh ke baad ke german vichaar par aadhaarit yah avadharana rashtriyata ko samvidhan ke sandarbh main paribhaashit karti he
 In this, the constitution is considered the philosophy of the nation rather than defining the rules governing public life
 kuch ajeeb tareeke se varsh 1950 bharat kaa 'shunya varsh' ban gaya yani vahiin se bhartiya vyavastha kii nai shuruyaat maani jane lagi
 The creation of a modern India was conceived, hoping to put the Indian nation in the archives before the constitution came into existence and only adding a finer link to the past
 duusari manyata yah he ki modi-kaal ke pehle hindu bahusankhyakwaad ke prati ghrinaa kaa bhav tha
 This meant that Hindu sentiment, especially in politics, had to be strictly controlled, but to protect the work to be done on the basis of diverse identities such as caste, class and region, and the philosophy of secularism

 The rapid development of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) began in 1989, but it was under the leadership of Narendra Modi that the party reached a position of dominance in the 2014 and 2019 elections, securing a majority on its own in the Lok Sabha
 ateet ke congressi sarvasammati ke siddhanton ke saamne narendra modi ne jo rashtravaadi chunauti pesh kii he, uskaa nishchit rup se rashtriya swayamsevak sangh-bhaajapa ke paaramparik hindu rashtrawaad se sambandh he

 They have succeeded in establishing corruption as a crime against the nation

 Nehru had a similar vision, but Narendra Modi has been able to relate it to popular aspirations, taking him ahead of the elite
 iske saath hi, jis tarah vivekanand ne pashchim main pahunchakar hindu gaurav ko badhaane kii koshish kii thi, vaise hi narendra modi ne bharat ko ek swagrahi lekin jimmedaar vaishvik shakti ke rup main pesh karne kii koshish kii he

 hindi sahitya kii mahishi lekhika mahadevi verma un virale sahityakaron main se ek hai, jinhone bhashaa or shilp main navachaar kii buniyaad rakhi
 He is one of the four major pillars of cinematography of Hindi literature
 sooryakanth treepathi niraala, jaishankar prasad, sumitranandan pant ke saath unhone hindi ke ek puure yug ko disha di
 That is why when she says - i changed my heart of sorrow, so much history, this is the only hope that was erased today
 to sahaj bharosa nahin hota
 Today is his death anniversary
 mahadevi verma vilakshan pratibha kii dhani kavyitri thi, or usase bhi kahin adhik maanviya rup main 'devi'
 Mahadevi was not named like this
 hindi sahitya ke mahaan kavi niraala mahadevi ko 'saraswati' naam se pukaarte the
 She is also called the 'meera' of the modern era
 mahadevi verma kaa janm 26 march saal 1907 ko uttar pradesh ke farrukhabad main hua tha
 His father Govind Prasad Verma named him Mahadevi
 pita peshey se shikshak the or maa hemarani devi ek gruhani
 Mahadevi was the only daughter in her family
 unki praarambhik shiksha indore ke mishan skool main hui
 After this, he enrolled in Krasthavet College in Allahabad
 unhen bachapan se hi likhane-padhane kaa khub shauk tha
 She was just 7 years old when she started writing poems
 mahadevi ne baalyavastha main hi mira, sur or tulsi jaise bhakt kaviyon kii rachanaaon padhanaa or gunana shuru kar diya tha
 Later, these great poets became the source of his inspiration
 mahadevi jab choti hi thi ki saal 1916 main unki shaadi dow swaroop narayan verma se kar di gai
 She continued her studies even after marriage
 haalanki unka daampaty jivan safal nahin rahaa
 But they had found a direction

 By editing this magazine, he gave women power, her rights and freedom a respectable place in the society
 mahadevi kaa maananaa tha ki nari ko apane adhikaron kii raksha ke liye shikshit hona ati aavashyak he
 In personal life, Mahadevi Varma was highly influenced by Mahatma Buddha
 unki rachanaaon main karunaa or samvednaa kaa bhav vahiin se aata he
 The Buddha's sutra 'jeevan is the root of sorrow' has always been reflected in his poems
 ek samay vah apni ghar-gruhasthi chhod sanyasi banane kii ore agrasar ho gayi
 During this time Mahadevi met the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi
 gandhi ji ne mahadevi ko sahitya sadhana karte rahane kii salaah di
 Mahadevi stayed and thus Hindi literature was enriched with her great compositions
 unki adhiktar kavitaayen or niabandh nariwadi drushtikon par kendrit hai
 Mahadevi's compositions touched every heart by using new and easy words to express compassion
 unke geet or unki kavitaayen aaj bhi praasangik hai
 Be it prose or poetry, he tried to develop the thinking of society by raising the values of life in every of his works
 saral, sahaj, karunamayi hone ke saath hi mahadevi bebaaki se apni baat samaaj ke aage rakhana bhi jaanati thim
 In the male dominated society of India, Mahadevi taught women across the country to fight for their rights
 unki kavy rachanaaon main rashmi, neeraja, sandhyagit, deepashikha, agnirekha, pratham aayam, saptaparna, yama, atmika, dipagit, neelambara or sandhini aadi shaamil hai
 Mahadevi Varma emerged as an important force in modern Hindi poetry
 unki gadhy kritiyon main meraa parivaar, smriti kii rekhaaen, path ke saathi, shrunkhlaa kii kadiyaan or ateet ke chalchitr aadi shaamil hai
 Posthumously in 1988, the Government of India honored him with the title of 'padma Vibhushan', the country's second highest honor, for his outstanding contribution to Hindi literature

 upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi, nagar vikaas mantri dow
 Prem Kumar and Food and Supplies Minister Shyam Rajak were also satisfied with the stock of preparations
 patna main har saal kareeb chaar lakh shradghaalu chhath puja main shaamil hote hai
 Ghats are few in terms of number of devotees
 saal 2011 main patna ke jila prashasan ne kul 70 ghaaton main se 21 ko or 2012 main 31 ghaaton ko asurakshit ghoshit kiya tha
 The Khatahala Ghat and the lethargic disaster management invited the accident

 kamiyon se sabak lene ke bajaae ab sarkaar un par paradaa daalane main jute gai he
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar says, "the reason for the accident is not the breaking of the Chachari bridge or the current
 balki yah haadasa bhagdad machane se hua he

" haadase main bal-bal bache bakarganj nivasee chandrabhushan bataate hai, ''bhagdad main kuchal gaye mahilaon, bacchon or bujurgon ko bachaane vaala koi nahin tha
 The locals opened the doors of the houses, leaving many
 ''chhath ke maukey par prashasan ne pukhta suraksha intjaam ke daawey kiye the
 For example, ambulances, medical teams and firefighters will be present at the ghats, 32 motorboats will continuously patrol the river
 lekin aapadaa ke vakt ye intjaam bekaar sabit hue
 Now the General Secretary of the State Health Association, Dr
 ajay kumaar bhi maan rahe hai ki immergency suvidha ke naam par bihar kaaphi pichhadaa hua he
 After the huge chaos at the ghat, the victims had to suffer two-fours in the state's largest hospital, PMCH, by the cremation system

 ruthik ke gharavaalon kaa aarope he ki use samay par ilaaj nahin mila nahin to aaj vah jinda hota
 The family members of the deceased, displeased with the chaos, created uproar and sabotage in the emergency ward of the hospital
 jiske baad bihar ke police mahanideshak abhayanand ko aspataal aakar sthiti sanbhaalani padi
 Vyasji, Principal Secretary of Health Department, was busy in defending the doctors of the hospital despite the uproar
 unhone kaha, ''aspataal ke chikitsak hangaame or marpet ke dar se maukey se hat gaye the
 Emergency service was soon restored by persuading them

 '' vyas ne bhi daawa kiya ki chhath ghaaton par aapadaa prabandhan kii timen tainaat thim, jinhone jimmedaari bakhubi nibhaai
 However, the chief minister did not delay in healing the wounds of the victims of the accident
 unhone mritkon ke parijanon ko aapadaa prabandhan kosh se dedh-dedh lakh ru
 And fifty-fifty thousand rupees from the Chief Minister's Relief Fund
 dene kii ghoshnaa kii or agle hi din peedit pariwaron ko raashi uplabdh bhi karvaa di gai
 But still they could not stop the opponents from speaking
 algepi pramukh ramvilas paswan ne kaha, ''ghat par kadi chaukasee hoti to yah ghatana nahin ghatati
 "so RJD Supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav asked the Chief Minister," Tell the Chief Minister who is responsible for the stampede and file a murder case against the guilty
 '' yadav ne aage kaha ki, ''isse badi prashasnic vifaltaa kya hogi ki piemasiech main kai jivit logon ko mrit ghoshit kar diya gaya
 "even during Lalu Prasad Yadav's tenure as Chief Minister, who is strongly questioning Nitish Kumar, such an incident has happened in Bihar on the occasion of Chhath
 1995 main is parv ke dauraan danapur ke nariyal ghat par naav durghatana main 62 logon kii maut ho gai thi, jisamen ek hi parivaar ke 17 log shaamil the
 The then Chief Minister of Bihar was Lalu Prasad

 No lessons were taken from these incidents

 However, it will be clear only after investigation at what level the negligence has taken place

 naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak (citizenship Amendment Bill) ko purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh (manmohan Singh) kii salaah par laayaa gaya, yah kahana he bijepi ke kaaryakari adhyaksh jagat prakaash nadda (JP Nadda) kaa
 JP Nadda exhorted the opposition to serve the interests of the nation rather than political interests and claimed that this would not pose any threat to the 'cultural identity' of the Northeast
 rajyasabha main is vidheyak par hui charchaa main bhaag lete hue nadda ne kaha ki yah vidheyak behad pareshaaniyon main jivan ji rahe lakhon logon ko sammanpurvak jivan jeene kaa adhikaar detaa he
 JP Nadda quoted a statement in Rajya Sabha made by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on 18 December 2003
 nadda ne kaha ki us samay manmohan singh ne tatkaaleen up-pradhanmantri laalkrishna adwani ko salaah dete hue kaha ki aise pratadit sharnaarthiyon ko naagarikta dene ke maamle main sarkaar ko apane ravaiye ko udaar bananaa chahie or naagarikta kanoon main badlaav karnaa chahie
 Nadda claimed that fulfilling Manmohan Singh's talk, our government has brought this bill
 bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki purvottar main yah bhram failaayaa gaya he ki is kshetra kii saanskriti pahchaan khatm ho jaaegi
 People will cease to exist there
 unhone kaha ki grih mantri amit shah is baat kaa pehle hi spasht aashwaasan de chuke hai ki is vidheyak ke kanoon banane ke baad bhi inner permit vyavastha jari rahegi
 The cultural identity of the Northeast will remain intact
 unke astitv ko koi khatra nahin hua he
 He accused Congress leader Anand Sharma that he has given many such arguments against the bill, which are not related to the original
 is vidheyak kaa ek hi aadhaar he ki afghanistan, bangladesh or pakistan main jin logon kii dharmik aadhaar par pratadna hui he, unhen bharat main sharan lene par naagarikta di jaaegi
 Earlier, while taking part in the discussion on the bill, Congress leader Sharma termed the bill as against the basic spirit of the Constitution and the right to equality
 jepi nadda ne kaha ki yah sachai bhale hi jitani kadavi ho par sach baat yahi he ki desh kaa vibhaajan dharm ke aadhaar par hua he
 He said that the massacre that took place at the time of Partition and the large number of people left their homes and went from one side to the other, has never happened in history
 unhone kaha ki vibhaajan ke samay bharat main alpsankhyak musalmaan, sikh, jain, parsi, isai alpsankhyak the
 Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis, Christians were minorities in Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki alpsankhyakon ke hiton kii raksha ke liye nehru-liyakat ali samjhauta hua tha
 But the agreement was not followed in Pakistan
 pakistan ke samvidhan ke anusaar vah ek islamic raashtra he
 He said that the population of minorities in Pakistan has reduced to just two percent
 unhone kaha ki iske vipareet bharat main alpsankhyak fal-phool rahe hai
 JP Nadda accused the opposition of not wanting to understand the situation
 unhone kaha ki yah vidheyak samvidhan ke anuchhed-14 ke tahat samanta ke adhikaar ko kisi bhi tarah prabhavit nahin kar rahaa he
 He said that people should visit the circumstances of such refugees in Indore, Kutch or West Bengal
 yadi aise logon ke halaat dekh liye jaae to vyakti turant is vidheyak par muhar laga degaa
 Referring to the reports of newspapers in New York Times and Guardian about the demolition of houses, shops and temples and gurdwaras of Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan, he said that minorities are facing a lot of harassment there
 jepi nadda ne aage kaha ki vahaan aise logon phiroti ke liye hatya kii gai
 They were forced to accept the religion of Islam by force
 nadda ne kaha ki is vidheyak ke saath kisi bhartiya naagarik ke saath anyaay nahin ho rahaa he
 He said that when the persecution of minorities has been done on the basis of religion, then its solution will also be on the basis of religion
 is vidheyak ko bas isi sandarbh main dekha janaa chahie
 He said that something else happens in the interest of politics and something else in the interest of the country
 unhone vipaksh ko salaah di ki vah raajnneeti kaa hit chhodkar desh ke hit ko dekhen

 Has anyone ever told you that drinking water can be harmful? Yes, you may not be aware, but drinking too much water can also be harmful
 ek study ke anusaar, ek shaks ko kitne gilaas pani pinaa chahie, iskaa koi vaigyanik aadhaar nahin he
 People who say that drinking eight or ten glasses of water, they say this on a mere estimate
 ek insaan kokitna pani pinaa chahie ye puri tarah seus jagah ke maahaul, vyakti kii aayu, ling or uski fitness par nirbhar karata he
 There is both shortage and excess water, both water scarcity and excess is dangerous for health
 pani kii kami se jahaan di-hydration hone kaa khatra bad jaataa he vahiin bahut zyada pani pine vaale vyakti ko overhydration kii shikaayat ho jaati he
 Most athletes are affected by this problem
 pani kii kami se ek ore jahaan unki maance-peshiyon main anthan aa jaati he vahiin bahut adhik pani pine se unke khun kaa gaadhaapan kam ho jaataa he
 Experts believe that water should be drunk as much as the thirst quenches
 pyaas nahin lagi ho to jabardastee pani nahin pien
 Drinking too much water causes dizziness and makes the person feel uncomfortable
 kai baar to dil kii dhadkan bhi tej ho jaati he
 But this does not mean that one should drink less water
 alcohol ko chhodkar ham jo bhi taral lete hai, usamen pani kii kuch maatra to hoti hi he
 Thirst means lack of water in the body
 pyaas laganaa sehat ke liye acha he
 Drink water only when you feel the need for it
 ghadi-ghadi, jabardastee pani pinaa sahi nahin he
 The amount of water in the body should remain, but not much
 sharir main pani kii kami kaa pataa ureen ke rang se bhi chal jaataa he
 If the color of your urine is dark, then it means that there is a lack of water in your body
 par ise thik karne ke liye dher sara pani pi lenaa sahi nahin he
 It is common for urin to turn pale yellow
