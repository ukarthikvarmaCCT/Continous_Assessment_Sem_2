 Salary workers will get standard deduction up to Rs 40 thousand on their annual income
 pehali najar main aap yah sunakar khush ho sakate hai, lekin ise laane ke liye sarkaar ne aap se bahut kuch chhina bhi he
 Apart from this, a 1% increase in cess has also proved this relief inadequate

 aapako kitna standard didction milegaa, ye is par nirbhar karegaa ki aap tex slab ke kis daayre main aate hai
 Has the budget given you the facility of standard deduction, but it has withdrawn the medical allowance and transport allowance you are getting

 Apart from this, you used to get a transport allowance of Rs 19200 in a financial year

 In the speech, the Finance Minister said that in the present time, the salaried people get the benefit of 30 thousand rupees from these allowances
 iskaa matlab he ki aapako sirf 10 hajaar rupee kaa tex benefit hi milegaa
 Do not forget the cess, but even if you are being told the cost of 10 thousand rupees due to standard deduction, you will not forget the increase in cess
 ab aapako 3 kii jagah 4 fisadi ses dena hoga
 The most impact will be on them, this change will affect the people, whose income is more than 5 lakh rupees
 unke liye standard didction ke taur par mili raahat naa ke baraabar he
 What will be the benefit of standard deductions? The advantage of bringing standard deductions is that your paperwork will be less
 iske baad aapako medical riimbersment hasil karne ke liye bills jamaa karne kaa jhanjhat nahin paalna padegaa

 After all, what will happen to these powerful people in the Supreme Court? We are talking about the very rich Indians who move to London, the capital of the old empire, between June and August
 bharat ke vakeelon main nami hastiyaan un amir logon main shaamil hai jinhen har garmiyon main landan jane kii chahat hoti he
 They can stop speaking of judges, can rescue high-ranking officers and powerful people in trouble by touching the sky with a fee

 Has CJI thought of people like him? apana rukh naram karne kii bajaae sijei ne bharat kii baar council ke adhyaksh se duusare rajyon kii baar council ke vichaar jaanane ko kaha he
 He has written letters to the Chief Justices of all High Courts and asked for their opinion
 sijei ne badlaav kaa apana khaakaa janata ke saamne bhi rakh diya he
 During the interaction with the media, he told that if all the judges take leave at different times of the year instead of taking leave together, the courts can be open 365 days
 unhone kaha, ''saal ke shuru main jajon ko adaalat kii sunwaayee kaa nirdhaaran karne vaale desk ko suchit karnaa hoga ki ve avkaash kab lenaa chaahate hai
 "accordingly, a calendar will be made for the Supreme Court and High Court Benches, so that the judiciary will continue to function without any hindrance," It is possible to do so and i hope that this method will work
 ”lekin sawaal yah he ki sijei khel kyon bigaad rahe hai? kolkata ke vakil ahin choudhary kehete hai, ''shaayad isliye ki nyaayik chola pahanakar ve aam aadmi kii ore se dakhal denge
 "as soon as the holiday is announced in the courts in May and June, the judge and the lawyer gather together to take advantage of the opportunity
" kuch log aaraam karte hai, nai takat jutate hai or soch-vichaar karte hai, kuch videshon main ghoomane chale jate hai to kuch mukademon kii taiyaari karte hai
 He told that having a recess for hearing 'urgent' cases makes the work of giving justice very sluggish
 choudhary kehete hai, ''aam aadmi ke liye jindagi tham-si jaati he
 He has to wait several weeks to get legal relief

 Very few judges speak like them openly

 "they are desperate to shorten the long list of outstanding cases in India

 63 crores and 39,780 cases in the Supreme Court are under consideration

 There are 5 lakh undertrials
 ek jaj ek din main ausatan kitne mukademe nibatata he yah gaur karne laayak he
 According to the 2013 report of the Justice Ravindra Bhatt Committee, there are around 19,000 judges across the country and accordingly it takes about 15 years to conclude a civil suit
 2013 main shuru kiye gaye neshnal court management system (ensiemes) ke anusaar, pichley teen dashak main jajon yaa adaalaton kii sankhya chah guna badi he, lekin mukademon kii sankhya 12 guna ho gai he
 With increasing literacy and per capita income, the number of new lawsuits filed per 1,000 population will increase to around 75 in the next three decades, while the current rate is 15 cases per 1,000 population

 50% delay in court proceedings is due to non-service of summons, validity of summons, correct identification and debate on such minor matters
 ve kehete hai, ''2ji spectrum aavanton jaise bahucharchit mukademe main bhi aropiyon se adaalat tak or adaalat se aropiyon tak bore bhar-bharkar kagajaat laae le jaae gaye
 “the reason for the rush of lawsuits in the courts is not the holidays, but the old style of functioning
 lekin jane-maane vakil ram jethmalani kaa tark he, ''jajon ko bhi aaraam chahie
 “the Supreme Court in India works for 193 days a year, the High Court 210 days and the lower courts 245 days
 america main bhi france kii tarah adaalatein garmi kii chuttee main kabhi band nahin hotin
 The Supreme Court of Canada has only 11 days off while in Britain the courts are closed 24 days a year
 jethmalani kehete hai, ''lekin hamaare oonchi adaalaton ke jajon par kaam kaa dabaav bahut zyada he
 a bench of two to three judges hears 50 to 70 prosecutions every day
 har shaam unhen agle din ke liye moti-moti filein padhpsi hoti hai or faisle likhane hote hai
 This work cannot be done in open courts
 ”jethmalani kaa kahana he ki bharat main chuttee kam karne se zyada jarurat badi taadaad main jaj bhartee karne or rajyon main sabhi khaali pad bharne kii he
 Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of pending cases in courts and the number of judges is also vacant
 sabase bade elahabaad hycourt main sarvaadhik 10 lakh mukademe vichaaradhin hai
 Still there are only 90 judges and 70 posts are vacant
 desh ke 21 hycourt main jajon ke 906 sweekrut padon main se 300 khaali hai
 More than 3,300 posts are vacant in the district and subordinate courts
 ve kehete hai, ''supreme court ne agle paanch saal main jajon kii kul sankhya 30,000 karne kaa lakshya banaaya he
 This is far more rational and reasonable thinking than sitting the judges in a 365 days court
 ”sawaal vahi he ki kya sabhi adaalatein 365 din jaagti rahen yaa jajon yaa vakeelon ko garmi kii lambii chhuttiyon main apane hisaab se jeene kii chhot di jaae? jaahir he ki bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish ne kanoonee tantra ke kaam karne ke tareeke se judi dukhati rag par ungali rakh di he
 But it also means looking at the specifics of the judicial system: spending long hot afternoons in extremely complex and complicated lawsuits and pleas

 Scientists have claimed that different species of frogs leap in different ways and that their bouncing depends largely on the environment around them
 pedo par rahane vaale mendhak unchai tak chadh jate hai lekin chalaang lagane par vah zyada duuri nahin tay kar pate
 In general, a water frog travels a long distance in jumps
 lekin jameen se zyada dur nahin jaataa
 On the other hand, a frog living in bills does not jump high nor does it cover much distance
 padhein: barish ke liye yahaan hoti he mendhakon kii shaadi
 
 
 Marta vidal-garcia, doing research at the Australian National University, captured the leap of about 230 frogs of 30 species in a video camera
 marta ne kaha, ‘hamane mendhakon ko unke prajnan ke vakt main yani barish ke baad raat ke andhere main khoja kyonki yahi vah samay hota he jab mendhak zyada sakriy hote hai'
 Based on the analysis, it was concluded that the leap of frogs depends on the environment around them and the leap of frogs living in different places is also different

 Bahubali star Prabhas's marriage has been discussed for a long time
 prabhas is samay telugu film industry ke sabase eligible bachaler hai or ladakiyon ke bich unki popularity bahut he
 Prabhas's name has always been associated with his Bahubali co-star Anushka Shetty
 haalanki in donon ne apane rishte kii khabaron ko hameshaa jhuthlaayaa he
 Now new news has come that Prabhas' family wants to get him married to the daughter of a US based businessman after the release of his film Saaho
 haalanki abhi is baat kii pushti nahin hui he
 On the other hand, Prabhas's Uncle Krishnam Raju had told the media last year that Prabhas would definitely marry this year
 jahaan prabhas ke ankal ne unke parivaar kii ichha ke bare main baat kii thi vahiin prabhas ne kaha tha ki ye unka nijee masalaa he or ve is bare main koi baat nahin karnaa chaahate
 Prabhas is one of the most popular stars in the Telugu film industry and has always kept his personal life safe from the eyes of the media

 uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar ne 17 ati pichhadi jatiyon ko anusuchit jati main shaamil karne kaa aadesh jari kiya he
 These 17 castes include Kahar, Kashyap, Kewat, Mallah, Nishad, Kumhar, Prajapati, Dhivar, Bind, Bhar, Rajbhar, Dhimar, Watham, Turaha, Godiya, Manjhi and Fisherman
 jinaki upi main kareeb 13 fisadi se zyada aabaadi he
 Politically 13 per cent of the vote bank is considered very important
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi se pehle mulaayam singh yadav or akhilesh yadav ne bhi ye daanv chalaa tha, lekin us samay in samudaay ko anusuchati jati kaa darj nahin mil sakaa tha
 In such a situation, it will have to be seen whether the Yogi government of the state succeeds in its plan or not? Let us tell that these backward castes have been demanding to be included in the Scheduled Castes for a long time in Uttar Pradesh
 inamen rajbhar 1
 32%, Potter and Prajapit 1
 84 fisadi or gond 0
 22 per cent
 iske alaava baaki 13 jatiyaan nishad samudaay main aati hai
 These include Nishad, Bind, Mallah, Kewat, Kashyap, Bhar, Dhivar, Batham, Fisherman, Kahar, Dhimar, Manjhi and Turaha
 in samudaay kii aabaadi kareeb 10 fisadi he
 In this way, the 17 castes recommended by the Yogi government to be included in the Scheduled Castes
 inaki kul aabaadi 13
 38 percent is happening
 aise main aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main haar jeet main ye jatiyaan ahm bhoomika adaa kar sakati hai
 Mulayam Singh Yadav first issued an order in 2005 to include these 17 backward castes in the Scheduled Castes
 mulaayam ke is faisle par hoicourt ne roak laga di thi, jiske baad is prastaav ko centre sarkaar ke paas bheja gaya
 Before getting approval from the central government, the government in Uttar Pradesh changed and Mayawati became the chief minister in 2007, then rejected the proposal
 iske baad in jatiyon ke anusuchit jati ke shaamil hone ke mansoobey par pani phir gaya
 Though Mayawati later wrote a letter to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh demanding her inclusion in the Scheduled Castes to help these castes, but the Central Government did not pay any heed to it
 mulaayam singh yadav kii tarj par akhilesh yadav ne vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle aisi hi koshish kii thi
 In December 2016, Akhilesh had approved the proposal of the Cabinet to include 17 backward castes in the SC
 centre ko notification bhejkar adhisuchana jari kii gayi, lekin is faisle ko hoicourt main chunauti di gai, jiske baad maamla centre sarkaar ke saamaajik nyaay or adhikarita mantralay main jaakar atak gaya
 Now the BJP has made efforts to address these very backward communities
 yogi sarkaar ne in 17 pichhadi jatiyon ko anusuchit jati main shaamil karne kii sifarish kar ek bade vot bank ko apane saath milaane kaa daanv chalaa he
 At present, there is a BJP government in both the Center and the state
 bataa den ki uttar pradesh main 20
 There is a Dalit population of 7 per cent, 66 sub-castes including Jatav, Valmiki, Dhobi, Kori, Pasi, Chamar, Dhanuk, who are socially divided
 inhen uttar pradesh main 21 fisadi aarakshan mil rahaa he
 In such a situation, if 17 extremely backward castes are included, then the number of sub-castes of the Dalit community will reach 83
 vahiin, uttar pradesh main obasi samudaay ko 27 fisadi aarakshan mil rahaa he, jinamein obisi main 79 jatiyaan shaamil hai
 The OBC community in Uttar Pradesh is around 52% of the population, including Muslim obcs
 is tarah se agar yogi sarkaar ke dwaara kii sifarish ko manjuuri milti hai to 17 atipichdi jatiyaan alag ho jaati he to 62 upjatiyaan bachengi
 In such a situation, where the castes will be less in 27% reservation of OBC, then the castes will increase in Scheduled Caste reservation
 darasal, sanvaidhanik prakriya ke tahat jatiyon kii pahchaan karne ke liye ayog banaae gaye the, jinke sadasyon ne desh bhar main gum kar anusuchit or pichhadi jatiyon kii pahchaan kii thi
 Even after this, they were divided into categories
 dalit chintak professor vivek kumaar kehete hai ki anusuchit jatiyon kii pahchaan karne ke liye jo maandand tay kiye gaye the
 According to him, those castes are considered untouchables, ie people whose touch gets contaminated
 unhen hi anusuchit jatiyon main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, those castes who are not untouchables cannot be included in the Scheduled Castes
 vah kehete hai ki jin 17 jatiyon ko anusuchit jati main shaamil karne kii baat kahi gai he kya vah chhua-chhot kii shikaar hai, agar nahin he to unhen anusuchit jatiyon main shaamil karnaa puri tarah se asanvaidhanik he

 Secondly, the Sangh / BJP and these 'extremist' forces create an ideological distance and even go astray so that their antics are always denied
 ek mukhute ke maamle main donon baaten antarnihit thim—janata ke saamne jane main doharaapan rahe or phir is baat kii sambhaavna rahe ki jarurat padane par kabhi bhi mukhute ke neeche ke asli chehre ko saamne laayaa ja sake
 But this margin group can never reveal any important thing about its center
 aise main media bhi donon hi chizon se batch jaataa he—use na to is baat kii padtaal kerani padati he ki kaise koi haashiye kii takat saat rajyon—sabhi bhaajapashasit—main chaar din tak bagaiyr kisi rokatoke ke vyapak paimaane par hinsa failaa sakati he or na hi use is baat kii jaraa-si bhi aalochana karne kii jarurat mahasoos hui ki bhaajapa / sangh se jude netaaon, sarkari padaadhikariyon or yahaan tak ki sensor board jaisi sansthaaon ne hinsa ko hawa dene main kya bhoomika nibhaai
 Nor is any connection between earlier incidents (killing Muslims and Dalits publicly) and subsequent violent incidents (communal riots in Kasganj) scrutinized
 bhaajapa / sangh ne aakhir kyon is sage sambandh kaa itnaa parihaas banane diya? rajasthan main aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav is ranneeti kaa ek hissaa he or phir jatigat golbandi or dhruvikaran kii raajnneeti hameshaa bade phaayde detii ai hi he
 It is also beneficial for the BJP / Sangh to keep the riotous army apart from itself because it helps people to keep thinking that the powers of the Center are not of 'marginalization', even if in reality they are against showing Padmavat There is really no difference between the military disturbance and the move of the four state governments to immediately ban the film
 phir, is tarah kii haashiye kii takaton kii maujuudagi se bhaajapa / sangh ko ek saath donon hi jagahen kabjane main madad mil jaati he
 Whether this place is for governance or against it
 apane hi virodh ko gadhakar hindutv kii chintaa aam logon ke gale madh di jaati he or sarkaar ko uskaa jawaab dena hi hota he
 By controlling such protests, starting and stopping at the whims of its own accord, the BJP makes it clear that it knows how to govern
 or phir, is ho-halle, aag, dhuen or raktapaat vagairah kaa istemaal hameshaa arthvyavastha, krishi sankat or jatigat takaraav jaise muddon par kisi bhi vaazib jan-virodh or ekajutata ko daraane main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 The reality is that without these forces of marginalization, the BJP / RSS central forces cannot keep themselves relevant
 aaysha kidawai nai dilli ke jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay main bhashaa-vigyaan kii professor hai*** In Thane, Maharashtra, a young woman killed her fiance by feeding him poisonous chocolate
 aaropee yuvati ko ladkaa pasand nahin tha, lekin uske ghar vaale us par usee ladke se shaadi karne kaa dabaav bana rahe the
 Due to this, the girl took this dreadful step

 The condition of the young man started deteriorating in a short time
 ladke ko fouran aspataal le jaaya gaya
 Where the boy died after 4 days during treatment

 Police then find out where the boy was when he was ill
 kiske saath tha
 And what did he eat
 or isi tarah police yuvati tak ja pahunchi
 When the police strictly questioned him, the whole case opened up
 yuvati ne police ko bataaya ki uske parivaar ne us ladke ko uske liye pasand kiya tha, lekin use wo ladkaa pasand nahin tha
 Due to this, he planned to remove the boy from the path
 or ladke ko bahaane se bulaakarazharileachocolate khilaa di

 All blogs: haldighati ke yuddh main maharana pratap kii veerta or shaury ke kisse bachche-bachche kii jubaan par hai
 In this most talked about battle in medieval history, a huge army of Akbar led by Rana Maharana Pratap of Mewar and Mansingh met face to face
 1576 main hue is bheeshan yuddh kaa nateeja ab yani 441 saal baad nikalne ja rahaa he
 Yes, the Government of Rajasthan is going to declare Maharana Pratap victorious in this war
 itihaaskaar hairaan hai lekin sarkaar ke iske peeche apane tark hai
 Read this - Maharana Pratap's name is a wonderful example of valor and promise
 BJP MLA from Kazhapur, Mohanlal Gupta has suggested that by shuffling the university books, Maharana Pratap should be shown the winner in place of Akbar in 'sangram of Haldighati'
 maharana pratap kii jeet ke daawey itihaaskaar dow
 Based on the research of Chandrashekhar Sharma
 univarsity ke itihaas vibhaag ke adhyaksh ke ji sharma bhi is maang se sahamat hai
 He says that he himself has done research on this subject and found that the war between Maharana Pratap and Akbar was a draw
 ye padhein -maharana pratap ke jivan se judi 10 batembaharhaal ye maamla sirf maang tak simit nahin rahaa he
 University Vice Chancellor Rajeshwar Singh has forwarded this proposal to the History Board of Studies
 board jaanch karegaa or phir academik council ko apruval ke liye bhejega
 If approval is given, Maharana Pratap will be declared the winner instead of Akbar's army in the battle of Haldighati by changing the books
 ye padhein -akbar vs maharana pratap karne se pehle ise jarur janenvaise akbar se bijepi kii khunnas nahin nahin hai

 RJD pravaktaa manoj jha ne kaha ki lalu pichhadi jati se hai isliye is tarah kii sajaa kii di gai he

 Controversy about the surgical strike is constantly deepening
 kaha ja rahaa he ki aisa pehali baar nahin hua he, balki upie shasankaal main bhi is tarah kii sargical strike hui hai

 sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki sargical strike apane kshetra kii raksha ke liye kiya gaya, jo ki sarkaar kaa adhikaar he
 India does not want to make any kind of misconception by giving evidence
 saboot saarvajanik karne par pakistani sena par javaabi karrwai karne kaa dabaav ho saktaa he, jo ki bharat ke liye hit main naa ho
 The government believes that even the US had not provided any evidence to kill Osama
 sarkaar ke sutron ke anusaar america or rus samet kisi bhi desh ko jab tak ki sargical strike puraa nahin ho gaya, uski jaankaree nahin di gai
 After the operation, the friendly countries were informed about it

 puure desh kii nigahen 12 may ko karnataka ke chunaav par rahengi, lekin piem modi is din nepal ke daure par rahenge
 PM Modi has been using every platform of the country and abroad to reach out to the people, now there are speculations that PM will be able to send some message from Nepal to the people of Karnataka
 
 piem kaa is baar kaa daura dharmikata se otprot he, iske bhi kuch siyaasi myne nikaale ja rahe hai
 After the year 2014, PM Modi has used every idea, every platform to convey his message to '125 crore countrymen'
 sanyukt raashtra main bhaashan ho, kisi desh main pravasi bharatiyon ke saath samvaad ho,abu dhabi main mandirka udghaatan ho yaa koi or event piem modi sidhe bharat kii janata tak apana sandesh pahunchane kii kala rakhte hai
 In such a situation, it is being speculated that PM will be able to convey his message to the people of India and especially Karnataka with his visit to Nepal

 After Janakpur, PM Modi will also visit other religious places of Nepal, Muktinath Temple, Pashupatinath Temple etc
 to jis din karnataka main chunaav hoga, bharat ke akhabaaron ke pehle panne par piem modi ke nepal yatra kii hi charchaa hogi
 Surely the newspaper headlines will be like PM Modi's grand reception in Nepal, worship in Janaki temple, modi-modi in Janakpur
 gauratlab he ki iske pehle saal 2014 ke apane daure main bhi piem modi nejanakpur kiyatra karne kaa man banaaya tha, lekin tab nepal main communist vipaksh main the or unhone iskaa virodh kar piem modi ke daure main badlaav karavaaya tha

 guuruuvaar ko supreme court dwaara vyaapman ghotaale ke saare maamle sibiai ko saunpane ke aadesh ke baad madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne press conference karte hue kaha ki vyaapman ghotaale kii jaanch mere liye agni pariksha thi
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that the Congress made many allegations against me, but the STF team honestly investigated this scam
 kuch sawal khadey hone ke baad vipaksh party congress ne use aaropon main tabdeel kar diya
 He said that the entire verdict of this investigation was mine, so it should be recognized that the Madhya Pradesh government has done a good job
 congress ne madhya pradesh ko ek khooni pradesh kii tarah chhavi banane kii koshish kii
 The CM said that the Supreme Court has praised the state government for the demand of the Madhya Pradesh government to conduct a CBI inquiry
 vyaapman ghotaale main sibiai jaanch bahut jaruri tha, kyonki hamaare khilaaf kai sawaal khadey ho rahe the
 The comments ab sibiai se aagrah karata hum ve jald se jald is ghotaale kii jaanch shuru kar den
 The Congress has always demanded my resignation because they are in awe of Shivraj

 At the same time, he refused to say anything about the post of Governor of Madhya Pradesh
 shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha ki congress ne mere upar kai aarope lagaae, lekin estf kii team ne eemaandaaree se is ghotaale par jaanch kii
 After some standing, the opposition party Congress turned it into charges
 unhone kaha ki is jaanch kaa puraa faisla meraa tha, isliye is baat ko maananaa chahie ki madhya pradesh sarkaar ne acha kaam kiya he
 The Congress tried to make Madhya Pradesh a bloody state
 siem ne kaha ki madhya pradesh sarkaar dwaara sibiai jaanch karne kii maang par supreme court ne rajya sarkaar kii tarif kii he
 The CBI probe was very important in the Vyapam scam, as many questions were being raised against us
 tippaniyan Now i request the CBI to start investigating this scam as soon as possible
 congress hameshaa meri istife kii maang karte rahi kyonki wo shivaraj ke bhay se grast hai
 If the Congress has any personal enmity with me, then they should take it out on me rather that they will discredit Madhya Pradesh
 vahiin, unhone madhya pradesh ke rajyapal ke pad ke bare main kuch bhi kehane se saaf manaa kar diya

 aapke footballar banane ke peeche sabase badi bhoomika kiski he? wo koun jisane aapkaa hameshaa saath diya, saport kiya?mere mata-pita
 If they had not supported me, i would not have been here today
 jab main chota tha tab se lekar aaj tak unhone mere kisi faisle par sawaal nahin uthaaya
 He never said don't do it, i did what i wanted and every time i got his support
 kai baar mujhe lagata he ki mere pita ne mujhamen apane khilaadi banane ke sapane ko dekha or use puraa karne main meri puri madad kii
 Why did you choose football? Why no other sport? i did not choose football, football chose me
 bhartiya footbalki maujuuda sthiti se aapako kya lagata he? kis disha main ja rahi he indian footbal?mere hisaab se yah sahi sthiti nahin he
 Nowhere do we look like a football power house country
 hamaare yahaan do ligs (iesail or ai lig) hoti hai lekin phir bhi bahut saare players ke paas koi contract nahin he
 i hope that one day this situation will improve
 jaisaa ki ham sab jaanate hai, bharat main tallent kii kami nahin he phir bhi ham footbal main itnaa peeche kyon hai? kya lagata he iske peeche koun jimmedaar hai?bahut se kaaran hai
 For example, lack of football education, lack of basic facilities
 iske saath hi achche scouting system kaa naa hona hamen sabase kharaab lagata he
 However, it cannot be pointed at a person by pointing out that he has a shortcoming
 iske peeche kahin naa kahin ham sab jimmedaar hai
 Wales' team was also out of the top 100 in last year's FIFA rankings, this year they are in the top ten, while they have only Gareth Bell and Aaron Ramsay named after the star players
 kya aapako lagata he ki ham kabhi nikat bhavishya main aisa karishma kar paaenge
 Nothing happens overnight, perhaps we did not notice but Wales had been involved in the development of football for the last 10-15 years
 moolbhoot dhaanche ke saath hi suvidhaayen or khilaadiyon ko milane vaala prashikshan, tamaam chizon main wales ne kaaphi sudhaar kiya he
 He provided him everything he needed to develop his players
 ye kisi jaadu kii tarah nahin hua balki ye to hona hi tha kyonki unhone pehle din se sahi disha main kaam kiya tha
 Where do you think the deficiency is? In resources, administrative level, environment or we do not have players of that level? They should get good facilities, coaching etc
 to improve the level of players
 kam se kam ek basic foundation hona chahie tab kahin jaakar unka str sudharta he
 We have a lot of talented players but we do not have the right means for their development
 iske peeche bharat kii badi aabaadi bhi ek factor ho saktaa he
 Because a large population has to work on a large scale
 har gaanv, kasbe, shahar main footbal ke vikaas ke liye kaam karnaa hoga tabhi bharat main iskaa vikaas ho paaegaa
 We cannot compromise at any cost in the name of basic needs
 norge main khilne kaa kaisaa anubhav rahaa he aapkaa?mjedaar, yahaan maine kaaphi kuch siikhaa he
 Coming here, i realized how talent development works
 yahaan club khilaadiyon kii lambey samay tak kii upyogita ko dhyaan main rakhkar unamem invest karte hai
 This benefits the club as well as the players
 ab tak ke khel jivan kaa koi aisa pal jo aap kabhi bhul nahin sakate?indian neshnal team ke liye debyue karnaa main kabhi nahin bhul saktaa
 Favorite cricket player, footballer, any hero of other sports and why? From cricket i like Yuvraj Singh, Dhoni, Virat Kohli
 jabaki footbal se mesi or tennis se federer mere pasandida khilaadi hai
 i like them because they are different from others
 indian dressing room kaa koi special moment, kissa jo aap hamase share karnaa chahen
 
 
 The celebration that took place in the dressing room of the Indian team after winning the SAFF Cup final is forever memorable
 idal kise maanate hai?vaan der saar (netherland neshnal team ke saath hi ye yuvents or manchester united ke bhi golkeeper rah chuke hai
 ) How far have you studied? School Name, College Name, Favorite Subject
 
 
 meri schooling saint steffens chandigarh se hui jabaki hiskool or 12th kii padhai maine esady public skool chandigarh se kii
 After this i did my BA from DAV College Chandigarh
 aapke hisaab se iesail se bhartiya footbal main kya badlaav aae hai?iesail ne bharat main bhartiya footbal ko pehle se zyada lokapriy kar diya
 In the SAFF Cup, you played a tremendous game, what special preparation did you prepare for it? Laughing, i spent three weeks at home before the SAFF Cup
 shaayad isiilie main acha pradarshan kar paaya
 What is the plan ahead? The plan ahead is that whenever i get into the field, i give my best and play more and more matches for Team India as well as Stubeck First Team
 apane prashansakon ke liye koi sandesh?doston, aapke saport ke bina ham kuch nahin hai

 udyogon ke aavanton maamle main upi sarkaar ko SC se fatkarasarkaar soti rahi, ab achaanak radd karne kii maang: scsamrakriwa jangal kshetra main udyogon ke aavanton maamle main uttar pradesh sarkaar ko supreme court se fatkaar lagi he
 In fact, the state government allowed industries and other activities in the protected forest area in September 1994
 justise arun mishra kii aguai vaali bench ne naaraazgi bhare andaaj main kaha ki 30 saal tak inhen galat daavon par sarkaar ne kuch nahin kiya or ab sarkaar inako di gai ijaajat cancil karne kii guhaar laga rahi he
 Surprisingly, the state government no longer has a list of allottees
 jab sarkaar ne court ko ye baat bataai to justise mishra ne kaha ki phir kis aadhaar par van adhikari un aavantiyon ke daawey paas kar rahe hai? supreme court main bhi ye maamla dedh saal ke baad sunwaayee par aayaa he
 The court reprimanded the UP government, saying that after granting permission 26 years ago, the government slept for so many years and is now suddenly demanding to be canceled
 court ne kaha ki upi sarkaar kaa apane adhikariyon par to niyantran he nahin or ulte court main kah rahi he ki wo duusare paksh ko sune bagaiyr aadesh radd kar de
 The court asked the Yogi government of UP to rate that in which areas new projects are still allowed
 court ne ye bhi kaha ki NTPC,UPEC jaise sansthaanon ko aankh mundakar projects ke liye jameen de di
 Now, after 26 years, when they are claiming the land, they are ready to unilaterally cancel the claim, but without hearing allottee companies and people, we cannot give any decision or order in this matter
 court ne kaha ki aapaki is laaparvaahee ke gambhir parinaam honge
 The UP government is now requesting the Supreme Court to dismiss the order for allocation of land to industries and other institutions in the protected forest area of renukoot-mirzapur in July 1994
 sarkaar ne supreme court se kaha he ki van adhikari or jila adaalatein abhi bhi un sansthaanon ke daawey ko manjuuri de rahi hai, jabaki supreme court 19 july 1994 ko aadesh jari kar sangrakshit van bhoomi ke atikaraman par roak laga di thi
 It was also said that after August 1994, no claim of anyone on this protected forest land will be valid
 yani 26 saal puraane sarvocch nyaayalay ke aadesh kii andekhi or avmaananaa karte hue jila adaalat or van adhikari apni manamaani 26 saal se karte rahe or rajya sarkaar sab chupchaap dekhati rahi
 The court is displeased with this
 marijon ko dekhne ke liye na to aspataal he, research ke liye na hi lab he or students ko padhaane ke liye na hi shikshak hai
 These situations are of a medical college, where 9 to 10 lakh rupees are being charged annually from a MBBS student
 ji haa
 
 
 This is the condition of the World College of Medical Sciences and Research, Jhajjar, Haryana
 college ke tamaam taal-matol ke baavjood jab MCI kii team ne college kaa daura kiya to aspataal kii pole khul gai
 During investigation, it was found that there was not a single patient in the hospital
 teen-chaar faikalti ke bharose medical college kareeb debsau embibies chaatro kii padhai karvaa rahaa he
 MCI has said in its report that fake patients were placed in the hospital to show the team, but all the counters from OPD to the forms were lying vacant
 isi world college of medical sciensej and research main embibies ke tisare saal kii student megha saini ne bataaya ki chaatro ke dabaav daalane ke baad phone par faikalti ko padhaane ke liye bulaayaa jaataa he
 In many departments, MBSC students are taught by BSC and MSC teachers
 world college of medical sciensej and research ne 2016 main 148 embibies students ke pehle batch kaa daakhila liya tha
 He also charged a hefty fee but after that, in the MCI investigation, these colleges did not meet the standards, so there was no admission after 2016 here
 lekin pehle batch ke 148 students ab yahaan funs gaye hai
 Despite spending millions of rupees after passing NEET exam, the students of third year MBBS have been sitting on hunger strike for the last two months, but there is no one to listen to them

 Seeing nothing happens, these students are now appealing for will death
 duusari taraf, jaankaree ke mutabik world college of medical sciensej and research ke maalik narendra singh hai
 Admission to MBBS was stopped in 2017 due to irregularities in this college
 iske baad 2017 main sibiai ne medical college ke sanchaalak narendra singh ko college chalaane ke liye ek adhikari ko 50 lakh rupye ghoose dete range haathon pakadaa tha
 On the basis of bribe, they wanted to get students enrolled in medical college
 chhattisgarh ke sambhageeya mukhyalay jagadalpur se lambii duuri kii teen express trainen chalati hai- samaleshwari, hirakhand, jagadalpur express or van-tu ve paisanger train, lekin yahaan ke railway stesan par plateform tikaton kii bikri nahin ke baraabar he
 According to the details of the financial year 2014-15, which ended on 31 March last month, only 27 platform tickets have been sold at Jagdalpur station
 adhikari bataate hai ki yahaan har maheene ausatan do platform tikaten hi bikati hai
 It is not that people do not come to the station leaving passengers
 roj do sau se teen sau yatri jagadalpur stesan par trainon main chadhate or utarate hai tathaa yatriyon ko train main vidaa yaa risive karne rojaanaa 25-50 log stesan pahunchate hai, lekin inamen se koi bhi plateform tikat nahin kharidta
 Actually, no one feels the need to buy platform tickets
 jagadalpur ke stesan adheekshak jon kujur kehete hai ki saal main 25-30 platform tikaten hi bik paati hai
 People talk of increase in facilities in the station, but when it comes to the cooperation of railways on issues like platform ticket purchase, etc
, back off
 logon ko aadat badalani hogi or railway ke prati sahyogaatmak ravaiya bhi dikhaanaa hoga
 It was told that a person coming from outside, who does not know about Jagdalpur station and reaches the station at the time of leaving the train for some work, then only those people sometimes buy platform tickets
 ek rail adhikari khud kehete hai ki tikaton kii checking kii vyavastha nahin he
 However, when there are more than a dozen routes from the platform to the exit of the station
 khulaa sthaan hone ke kaaran bina tikat yatri aasaani se baahar nikal jate hai
 According to officials, tickets are not being checked due to lack of posting of TTE or TC in Jagdalpur
 pichley kuch saalon main stesan manager ke rup main em
 R
 nayak or commercial manager ke pad par si
 H
 rangarav padasth the, tab ye donon adhikari maah main kam se kam ek baar get main tikaton kii checking karte the, lekin inke tabadale ke baad tikaton kii checking puri tarah se band he
 Till now the price of platform ticket was five rupees, but it has been doubled to ten rupees from April 1, but Jagdalpur station will not get any benefit due to non-sale of tickets
 jaankaree ke mutabik, kirandul-kottavalsa relline main bastar main kirandul se lekar amaguda tak 18 stesan aate hai
 Only one of these stations, Jagdalpur, has a few tickets sold in a year
 is iklaute stesan ko chhod den to kirandul se lekar amaguda tak plateform tikaton kii bikri kaa khaataa bhi nahin khulata he

 Jinnah raga of BJP leader Jaswant Singh did not suit Bal Thackeray
 jaswant ne apni kitaab 'jinna india partishan independence' main mohammad ali jinna kii jo taareef jhonki he us par bal thakare ne jaswant singh samet puri bijepi ko lapete main le liya he
 Why does Jinnah slip on the issue? In the Sena mouthpiece Saamna, Balasaheb has written an editorial on this subject
 lekh main kaha gaya he ki bijepi netaa naa jane kyon jinna ke masale par baar-baar fisal jate hai
 BJP leaders are competing to pay tribute to Jinnah
 thakare ne likhaa he ki adwani kuch saal pehle pakistan gaye the to unhone bhi jinna ko sachcha secular bataaya tha
 Now Jaswant Singh is also standing in the same line
 jaswant singh ne to yahaan tak kah daalaa ki bharat-pakistan kaa bantwaaraa jawahar laal nehru kii vajah se hua
 All this for the publicity of the book, Bal Thackeray took a direct aim and said that Jaswant Singh is doing this to get the publicity of his book
 thakare ke mutabik hindustan main musalamaanon ko barabari kaa adhikaar mila he
 From politics to the judicial system, Muslims are everywhere, why Jaswant is crying the poor condition of Muslims

 In the hope of coming home early, repairing the house or hoping to live their childhood once again as a child, many soldiers sacrificed their lives to protect the motherland and left behind a never-ending wait
 kargil yuddh par visheshvarsh 1999 main hue kargil yuddh main vijay kii 13veen vashargonth manaai ja rahi he or in dinon nai dilli main padasth major chakradhar ko apane dost 31 varshiya major padmapani acharya kii yaad taaja ho gai jo kargil abhiyaan main dushman kii golabari main shahid hue the
 Born on 21 June 1968 in Hyderabad, Padmapani graduated from Osmania University
 unke sahyogi or sahpaathee major chakradhar ne bataaya, ‘ham 1993 main saath-saath sena main shaamil hue the
 After training in Madras, Padmapani received a commission in Rajputana Rifle and posted in Assam and Delhi
 ’major chakradhar ne bataaya, ‘main computer ejeeniyar hum or mujhe pehle dilli bheja gaya or phir kashmir
 The two of us met when Padmapani was posted in Kashmir
 1996 main unki shaadi hui thi
 He was about to become a father that the Kargil War started
 vah shahid ho gaye
 Her father Jagannadham was in the Indian Air Force and is now retired
 unhen apane bete kii shahadat par garv hota he
 Padmapani's younger brother Captain Sambhav Acharya is also in the army
 ’dilli kii ek company main kaam kar rahe bhavani singh kii ankhen apane pita soobedaar bhavar singh rathore ko yaad kar nam ho jaati hai
 Says Bhavani Singh, 'our ancestral house in Behsana village of Pali district of Rajasthan still bears a plank of Bapusa's name on which is written' Subedar Bhanwar Singh Rathore '
 unka saamaan usee tarah rakhaa he jaisaa vah khud rakhte the
 His scooter is also standing on which he wrote 'army' with great passion
 ’vah kehete hai, ‘vah kargil sector main 17 june ko dushman kii golabari main shahid hue the
 Then he had only 44 days to retire
 31 july ko unhen sevanivrutt hona tha or meri badi bahan kii shaadi kii taiyaari kerani thi
 i have three sisters

 He kept waiting

 Ganesh Yadav of the Bihar Regiment came to his house three months before the Kargil War
 patna jile ke pandechak gaanv main rah rahe unke pita ramdev prasad ne phone par bataaya, ‘usne vaada kiya tha ki vah agast main chuttee lekar aayega or makaan kii marammat karavaayega
 He did not come, news of his martyrdom in the battle of Kargil came

 Prasad says, 'he was the eldest of three brothers
 uski yaad bahut aati he
 Any festival or joyous occasion would become memorable by its presence
 mujhe khushi he ki vah desh kii khatir shahid hua
 The Kargil War, which began in May 1999, lasted two months and ended only after the Pakistani troops captured the mountain peaks of India

 Plenty of all-rounders
 braavo, jadeja, raina, dwen smith, aswin, jon hestings or baba aparajit jaise khilaadi har aitbaar se team ko phayda pahunchaa sakate hai
 Weak side: Bowling is commanded by good but less experienced players
 bolinger, nainess, kris moris or albi morkel ab nahin hai team ke saath
 The captain will have to sit anew and coordinate with the bowlers
 export coment: do baar ipel jeet chuki chennai super kings kii team agar apni takat ke mutabik kheli to jeet kii badi daavedaar ho sakati he
 Batting, bowling and fielding are the top teams in all three departments
 kolkata nite ridesmajboot paksh: yusuf pathan kaa achche form main
 Robin Uthappa and Manish Pandey's entry can benefit
 videshi khiladiyon main kallis, rayaan ten dashkate or shakeeb al hasan gend or balle se karenge madad
 Sunil Narine, Morne Morkel, Umesh Yadav, Piyush Chawla and r Vinay Kumar are very good bowlers in terms of T20
 kamjor paksh: bharosemand wicketiper kii kami
 Robin Uthappa has less experience of keeping
 plaing 11 chunane main aa sakati he dikkat
 Some bad fielders can also upset the team
 export coment: neshnal team main vaapasi kii koshish main lage captain gautam gambhir ke paas he sahi mauka
 Balance is seen in the team's appearance, but Kallis, Yusuf, Gambhir Fielding will have to focus a lot
 royal chalangers bangaloremajboot paksh: pichhali baar se zyada majboot lag rahi he team
 Batting strong with players like Gayle, de Villiers, Kohli, Yuvraj, Albie Morkel and Parthiv
 mishael stark, ravi rampaul, varun eron, dinda or muralidharan jaise khilaadi gendbaaji department ko bana rahe santulit
 Domestic players like Shadab Jakati, Vijay Zol and Abu Nachem Ahmed can do wonders
 kamjor paksh: khal sakati he ek vishwastareey spinner kii kami
 Muralitharan is definitely with the team but there may be a lack of match practice
 export coment: tii-20 vishwa cap final main haar ke baad yuvaraj kii kaaphi kirakiri hui thi
 Now there is both a challenge and a chance for Yuvi
 captain kohli agar apane gendbaajon ko achche dhang se istemaal kar paae to ye team sabase khatarnaak ho jaaegi
 Delhi Daredevils: Strong side: Motivation of former team India coach Gary Kirsten
 team compojishan behatar
 Outstanding foreign players like Peterson, Duminy, Ross Taylor, Jimmy Nisham and Wayne Parnell
 dinesh karthik, murali vijay, manoj tiwari, mohammad shami, lakshmi ratan shukla or saurabh tiwari jaise badhiya gharelu khilaadi
 Weak side: Bowling relies largely on Mohammed Shami
 baaki ke bhartiya gendbaajon main anubhav kii kami
 Foreign bowlers include Wayne Parnell and Nathan Celtnile Average Performer
 export coment: pichley saal sabase phiseddi team sabit hone ke baad dilli ne puri tarah nai team khadi kii he
 The team also hopes to change their fortunes

 sunrisers hyderabadamajboot paksh: eron finch, warner, bhubaneshwar, parvej rasul or irfan pathan jaise khiladiyon ke aane se team kaa santulan behatar ho gaya he
 Players like Dhawan, Stan, Sammy, Ishant and Amit Mishra are already in the squad
 gendbaaji ab bhi ballebaaji se behatar
 The weak side: Top orders are very heavy
 dhawan, finch or warner nahin tike to middle order main naman ojha, venugopal, saimi, parvej rasul or irfan jaise khilaadiyon par nirbhar rahanaa padegaa
 Expert comment: Team composition is better than last time but Shikhar Dhawan and coach Tom Moody have to be very considerate to select the last eleven players
 middle order main koi bahut majboot khilaadi dikh nahin rahaa he
 Mumbai Indians: Stronger side: The arrival of Corey Anderson has got another T20 specialist
 sachin ab maidan par saath nahin honge, par jahir khan or mike hasi anubhav ke factor ko balance karenge
 The good thing is that the team now also has a lot of young players
 gendbaaji kaaphi majboot he
 Weak side: Team looking weaker than last time
 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki is baar ye team sabase asantulit he
 The batting seems to revolve around Rohit Sharma, Mike Hussey, Pollard, Rayudu and Korey Anderson
 export coment: mumbai team maalik ne shaayad kore anderson or lasith malinga par kaaphi bharosa kiya hua he, lekin samajhnaa hoga ki sirf do khiladiyon ke dam par khitaab kii rakhwali nahin kii ja sakati
 The title looks a bit difficult for the defending champions

 Although Punjab has made a very good team this time with less money
 team kaa din rahaa to dhurandhar tiimon ko bhi dhul chataane main sakasham
 Rajasthan Royals strong side: Rahul Dravid will play an important role in success as a mentor
 watasan, bread hoj or james phoknar ke saath saath steven smith kaa team ke saath judane se team bani or bhi khatarnaak
 All-rounders abound in the team
 kamjor paksh: gendbaaji ek baar phir bahut majboot nahin
 Lack of Indian bowlers
 gharelu gendbaajon main vikramjit maalik, dhaval kulkarni or ikbaal abdulla par hi he daaromadar
 Expert comment: Once again the team will have to depend too much on their batsmen
 haalanki stuart binni or abhishek nair jaise kuch achche domestic khilaadi team kii gendbaaji ko balance kar sakate hai
 The tradition of this team has been to give good performance without big stars and this hope is also maintained this time

 haryana police ne tantra mantra vaale jisserial kilorko giraftaar kiya he, wo desh ke 50 shaharon main ab tak 7 hatyaein kar chukaa he, 600 se zyadalootki vaardaaton ko anjaam de chukaa he
 But this craze has not subsided yet
 wo bhi tab jab wo lutpaat jaise gunahon main kam se kam 40 baar jail bhi ja chukaa he
 He has killed 7 people
 har katl ke pehle karata tha kaali maa kaa jaap
 He has committed 600 burglaries in 50 cities
 desh bhar kii das jelon main bitaayaa he vaqt
 Can't remember how many times he visited prison

 He executed all the incidents for money

 Its name is Jagtar Singh

 Its criminal history is more than 20 years old
 jis dauraan isane desh bhar ke 50 shaharon main 7 hatyaein, 600 lut, chori or snatching kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya
 It did its first slaughter in 2005 and it remembers the year and date of each slaughter
 usko khud yaad nahin he ki isse pehle wo kitni baar giraftaar ho chukaa he
 When the Crime Branch of Faridabad caught it, he had no idea which serial killer his hands were on
 jagataar kii maane to apane krime kariyar main ye pehali baar he, jab usne gunahon ko police ke saamne kabuula ho
 There was nothing special about Jagtar's way of working
 haa ek baat khaas thi wo thi uskaa akele hi vaardaat ko anjaam dena
 Used to do this crime alone was a crime
 usne apana koi gang nahin banaaya
 He used to attack in secluded places
 dhardaar hathiyaar ke bal par lutpaat karata tha
 Most people used to hand over the goods to him
 jo jagataar kaa virodh karte the wo un par hamalaa kar detaa tha
 He used a dagger, knife, scissors and other weapons in the murder
 vaardaat ke bare main wo kisi ko nahin bataata tha
 Did not stay in one place for long
 baar-baar jagah badalane kii vajah se police kii radar par nahin aa paata tha
 Faridabad Police Jagtar's arrest is acknowledging her great success
 usne tamaam thanon kii police ko jagataar kii giraftaar kii ittila di he, jinke ilaakon main usne vaardaat ko anjaam diya tha
 Police hope that after the interrogation of Jagtar, some other incident may be revealed
 jo abhi tak ek raaj banakar hi rah gai thim

 a new controversy has erupted over the film 'gumnami' based on Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose
 bose parivaar ke 32 sadasyon ne nirdeshak srijith mukherjee par aarope lagaaya he ki film nirmaataa ne sensor board kii manjuuri paane ke liye film kaa naam ‘gumnami baba' se badalakar ‘gumnami' rakh diya he
 The film on Bose's disappearance incident is already in dispute
 nirdeshak ne bose dwaara sthapit ‘ol india forward block' ke karyaalay main ravivaar ko film ke trailor kii screening kii thi
 The director has termed the allegations leveled by some descendants of the freedom fighter as untrue
 film ko agast ke aakhri hafte main sibiefasi se manjuuri mili thi
 The film will be released in theaters on 2 October
 netaji kii bhatiji chitra ghosh, unke bhattije dwarka bose or bose parivaar ke 30 anya sadasyon dwaara hastakshrit ek bayaan main somvaar ko kaha gaya he, ‘‘pichley ek saal se, jab se srijith mukherjee ne film ‘gumnami baba' kii ghoshnaa kii he, unhone kaha tha ki yah film chandrachud ghosh or anuj dhar kii pustak ‘conandram' par aadhaarit he
 Now he (shrijit Mukherjee) has suddenly changed his stand to get approval from the censor board and says that the film is based on the Justice Mukherjee Commission report
 unhone film kaa naam bhi badal diya he
 Denying the charge, Mukherjee said in a Facebook post, "is there a bundle of sheer nonsense and lies
 tiger poster sahit sabhi ghoshnaaon main pehle din se hi film kaa naam gumnami he
 The decision to make the Mukherjee Commission report the basis of the script, not Conundrum, was taken long before the shooting of the film, which was several months before the controversy
 mukherjee ne ravivaar ko kaha tha ki eiembi ke varisht netaaon ne trailor dekha or ve film kaa premier dekhne ke liye sahamat hue hai
 The filmmaker said, "aifb's 20-member representative will decide whether 'anonymity' has hurt the feelings of Netaji's fans and people
 ''eiembi ke varisht netaa naren de, haripad vishwaas, devvrat vishwaas, naren chatarji ravivaar ko rajya party mukhyalay main screening samaaroh main maujuud the

 aspataal or police adhikariyon ne bataaya ki himanshu kataara ko uske do mitron ne ames parisar main uske hostel ke kamare kii chat se mangalvaar subah saadhe 11 baje ke kareeb latakta paaya
 According to a statement issued by AIIMS, two of Katara's friends went to the back of her room and peeped through the window, then found the student hanging from the ceiling
 tippaniyan a senior police officer said, he also informed other students and hostel wardens
 ve ghatnasthal par pahunche
 Police was also informed
 ames ne ek vaktavy main kaha, chaatr ko chat se latakate paaya gaya or sharir thanda pad chukaa tha
 There was no sign of life
 warden ne turant uski maa or bahan ko ghatana ke bare main suchit kiya
 He was taken to AIIMS Casualty, where he was declared dead
 ames ne vaktavy main kaha, kataara acha chaatr tha or uske sahpaathiyon ne use hameshaa maitreepurn, khushmijaaj or behad saamaajik paaya
 He was always active and involved in various cultural and extra-curricular activities
 police ghatana kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Hospital and police officials said that Himanshu Katara was found hanging from the ceiling of her hostel room in AIIMS campus by her two friends around 11:30 AM on Tuesday
 ames kii ore se jari ek vaktavy ke anusaar kataara ke do mitra uske kamare ke peeche gaye or khidki se jhaanka, to chaatr ko chat se latakta paaya

 They reached the scene
 police ko bhi suchit kiya gaya
 "the student was found hanging from the ceiling and the body had cooled down," AIIMS said in a statement

 The Bharatiya Janata Party has been successful in stopping the ascent of the Congress in Gujarat and is seen retaining its stronghold
 india today-exis-maay-india agsit pole ke nattejey aise hi sanket de rahe hai
 The exit poll predicts BJP getting 99-113 seats in 182 member assemblies
 jahaan tak congress gathbandhan kaa sawaal he to use 68-82 siton se hi santosh karnaa pad saktaa he
 This time bjp's vote share is estimated to fall by 1% as compared to 2012 election
 2012 main bijepi ko 48% vot mili the to is baar party ko 47% vot hi milte najar aa rahe hai
 However, the vote share of the Congress seems to have increased by 3% votes compared to the 2012 elections
 congress ko 2012 main 39% vot mili the
 The Congress is estimated to get 42% of the votes in this election
 exis-maay-india agsit pole ne saurashtra or kuccha kii 54 siton par congress ko acha laabh milte hue dikhaaya he
 Congress has also performed well in 32 seats in North Gujarat
 lekin bijepi dakshin or madhya gujarat main paaramparik taur par apane majboot gadhon main damdaar pradarshan ke boote phinishing rekha ko paar karti najar aa rahi he
 The same thing can be said for the BJP in the 21 seats of Ahmedabad
 agsit pole main kshetravaar nateezon par najar daalane se pataa chalata he ki kyon raajnneetik panditon or netaaon kii ore se chunaav campagne ke dauraan mishrit sanket saamne aa rahe the
 In Saurashtra, Kutch and to a lesser extent in North Gujarat, the Leuva and Kadva Patels, Thakors, Kolis and Dalit voters have largely voted for the Congress
 lekin party isi tarah kaa matadaataaon kaa vishwaas madhya or dakshin gujarat kii siton or ahmedabad jile kii 21 siton par hasil nahin kar saki
 The exit poll indicates that if the Congress had formed an alliance with Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakor and Jignesh Mevani in South and Central Gujarat three to four months before the elections, it would have done far better in the results
 1995 se gujarat kii satta par kabiz bijepi ke liye 2017 chunaav mushkil or thakaane vaali ladaai rahaa he
 The 22-year anti-incumbency (anti-incumbency) hit the saffron party's image in this election
 lekin bijepi agar phinishing line ko paar karne main safal ho rahi he to iske do ahm or bade kaaran he
 First, to feel proud on behalf of the people of the state for a Gujarati to be the Prime Minister of the country
 or doosraa, bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke netritv main durjey santhnik chunaav mashinari
 It is interesting to see that the axis-my-india exit poll is showing the Congress ahead of the BJP on the number of seats in Saurashtra, Kutch and North Gujarat
 saurashtra or kuccha kii kul 54 siton main se congress kaa 30 siton par aage rahane kaa anumaan he, vahiin bijepi k 23 seat hi milti dikh rahi hai
 Of the 32 seats in North Gujarat, the Congress is projected to lead in 18 seats
 uttari gujarat main bijepi ko 14 siton se hi santosh karnaa pad saktaa he
 In central and south Gujarat as well as in Ahmedabad, BJP seems to have an unbeatable lead
 madhya gujarat kii kul 40 siton main se bijepi ko 29 seat milti najar aa rahi hai
 Here the Congress is expected to get only 11 seats
 dakshin gujarat kii 35 siton main se bijepi 25 siton par aage najar aa rahi he, yahaan congress ke khate main sirf 10 seat jaati najar aa rahi hai
 Exit polls show that GST and demonetisation have not hurt bjp's prospects in urban areas
 shahari gujarat kii baat kii jaae to bijepi kul 55 siton main 42 siten jhatak kar shandaar pradarshan kii ore agrasar he
 Gujarat businessmen may have been vocal in expressing unhappiness over GST, but they chose to stand with the BJP on polling day
 shahari kshetron main congress ko mahaj 13 seat milane kaa hi anumaan he
 In commercial areas like Surat, Vadodara and Ahmedabad, the Congress is once again looking bad
 jahaan tak gujarat kii 127 gramin siton kaa sawaal he to yahaan bijepi or congress ke bich kaante kii takkar hui he
 BJP is seen winning 64 seats in rural Gujarat
 vahiin congress bhi 62 seat jitkar bijepi ko barabari kii takkar detii najar aa rahi he
 It is also coincidental that in rural Gujarat both BJP and Congress are getting equal vote share i
e
 45% -45% of the votes
 jatigat aankadon kii baat kii jaae to gujarat agsit pole gujarati votaron ke man kii thaah par acchhee tarah roshni daalata he
 In 12 seats dominated by Leuva Patel of Gujarat, Congress is seen winning 8 and BJP 4 seats
 kadva patelon kii bahulata vaali rajya kii chaar siton main se congress ko 3 seat milane kaa anumaan he
 It is clear that the Hardik Patel factor has given a tough blow to BJP on Patidar-dominated seats
 ye siten pehle bijepi kaa majboot garh maani jaati thim
 The alliance with Alpesh Thakor has benefitted the Congress on seats dominated by Thakore
 thakoron ke asar vaali 25 siton main se congress ke khate main 13 seat jaati najar aa rahi hai
 BJP is expected to get 12 seats here
 bijepi abiy pichhadaa jatiyon (obisi) ke prabhaav vaali 52 siton main se 35 seat jhatak kar acha pradarshan karti najar aa rahi he
 The Congress may have to settle for only 16 OBC dominated seats
 gramin ilaakon main patidaar votaron ke congress ke samarthan main ekajute hone kaa ek asar ye bhi rahaa ki pratidwandvi samudaayon ke voton kaa jamaavada duusari taraf ho gaya
 It is also interesting to see that the impact of the Patidar and Thakor movements was seen only in North Gujarat where Sehardik Patel and Alpeshthakore hail from
 jahaan tak dakshin or madhya gujarat kaa sawaal he to vahaan patidaaron or thakoron ne badi sankhya main bijepi ko vot diya he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah have been working hard to make inroads in the tribal areas of Gujarat
 ye ranneeti bijepi ke liye bahut kargar rahi he
 The BJP seems to be leading in 17 seats in Gujarat's 28 tribal seats
 vahiin congress ke khate main 11 seat jane kaa hi anumaan he
 It is a matter of concern for BJP that it seems to be loosening its grip on young voters
 agar aayu varg kii baat kii jaae to sirf 18 se 25 saal umr ke bich ke votaron ke samarthan ke maamle main hi congress ko bijepi par badhat hasil hui he
 The Congress is estimated to get 45 percent of the vote in this age group
 vahiin bijepi ko 1 fisadi kam yani 44% vot share miltaa najar aa rahaa he
 It seems that the three young Turks of Gujarat joining hands with Rahul Gandhi had some effect on the young voters
 bijepi ko sabase zyada samarthan 60 se zyada ayuvarg ke votaron se miltaa dikh rahaa he
 BJP has been the choice of 51% of the voters in this age group
 vahiin 37% votaron ne congress par bharosa jataayaa
 It is interesting to see that BJP among older voters and Congress among younger voters was seen taking the lead
 jaise aayu-varg upar se neeche hota gaya vaise hi donon partiyon kaa vot antar bhi sikudta gaya
 The exit poll revealed another indication that the Congress received the strongest support from uneducated voters
 yahaan congress ko 47% vot share milane kaa anumaan he
 At the same time, 44% illiterate voters were seen in support of BJP
 bijepi ko sabase zyada samarthan graduate or post-graduate votaron se mila
 50% of the highly educated voters are seen standing with the BJP
 congress ke liye, jise pehle gujarat chunaavon kii daud main bhi shaamil nahin mana jaataa tha, agsit pole dikhaa rahe hai ki is party ne ateet ke chunaavon kii tulana main kahin adhik damdaar pradarshan kiya he
 Although Gujarat voters are showing these results, Kirahul Gandhi has undoubtedly elevated his stature but still Delhi is far away for him to match the height of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and he has a long way to go
 upi vidhansabha chunaavon main mili haar ke baad akhilesh yadav ko lagaataar virodh kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 First father Mulayam Singh attacked him and now another SP leader has fired a letter bomb on him
 sapa ke purv sadsy pradesh kaaryakarini sudhir singh ne letters main likhaa he ki ghamand to ravan kaa bhi nahin rahaa to ham aap kya cheez hai? haar se aapane koi sabak nahin liya he
 You are caught in the clutches of some people
 'ghamand main chur ho gaye akhilesh'sapa netaa ne likhaa ki aap haar kii mandalwaar samiksha kar rahe hai, lekin aapako 5 saalon se aapaki sarkaar chalaane vaale 9 ratnon ke gut kii boothwaar samiksha karnaa chahie
 Those who did not have a bicycle are now driving in a BMW convoy
 aapke 9 ratnon ne aapako yah samajha diya ki aapaki lahar 2014 kii modi lahar se bhi zyada chal rahi he or aap in chatukaaron kii dwaara banaai gai kaalpanik lahar main gote lagaakar dobaaraa siem banane ke sapane dekhte rahe
 Stung in this moment, you took out Shivpal Yadav, who had created the party due to the struggle, by insulting him twice
 ramgopal ko kaha shakunisudhir ne aage likhaa ki jis mulaayam singh ne apni jeevanabhar kii kamai aapako saunp di, shakuni ramgopal yadav ke kehane par unhen adhyaksh pad se hataa diya gaya
 The reason for your downfall was the January 1 conference at Janeshwar Mishra Park
 us din adhikansh samaajwaadiyon ke ghar chuulhe nahin jaale
 Your uncle and your father were abused in front of you and you kept smiling
 aap ghamand main itane chur the ki chaar-chaar baar vidhayak rahe logon kaa tikat katkar kal ke ladakon ko tikat de diya
 Questions have also been raised about Akhilesh's work in this letter
 chachaa-pita kaa hamalisse pehle shivpal ne akhilesh par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki jo apane maa-baap kaa sammaan nahin karata vah jivan main tarakkee nahin kar saktaa
 Also, where should the new generation follow morality and values
 mulaayam ne apane grihgile mainpuri main party ke ek kaarykram main akhilesh ke bare main kaha tha ki jo apane pita kaa nahin ho sakaa, wo kisi kaa kya hoga
 Mulayam said that he made Akhilesh Yadav the chief minister after winning the election
 desh main kisi or netaa ne ab tak aisa nahin kiya lekin akhilesh ne apane chachaa ko hi mantrimandal se hataa diya
 Mulayam also spoke on the party's poor performance in the recent elections

 In order to pursue the highest standards of transparency set by my government, my government has brought government procurement on a single platform, "government e Marketplace" —GEM (gem)
 " jem portal kholte hi raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kaa sansad main diya yah sandesh khulata he
 In fact, the Union Commerce Ministry took a major step on 9 August 2016 to make the process of purchasing goods in government departments more transparent
 iske tahat sarkari kharid ke rate tay karne vaale diarector general of supplai and distribution (dijiesendi) ne sari sarkari kharid ko digital karne kaa praavdhaan kar diya
 For this, the government abolished the long-standing rate contract (RC) system
 aarasi paddati main hota yah tha ki saamaan kii hajaaron kismon ke sabase kam mulya ko dijiesendi tay karata tha or usee mulya par vibhaagon ko saamaan khareednaa hota tha
 a senior official of DGSND states that under the RC methodology, Rs 2,500 crore every year
 kii kharid hoti thi, jabaki baaki kharid tender or vibhageeya prakriyaaon se hoti thi
 2 lakh crore in Central Government and Government Undertakings in a year
 kii seva or saamaan kii kharid hoti he (dekhen boxh jem kaa jalawaa)
 According to DGSND, Rs 300 crore from Gem was released in March 2017 only after the mandatory rule was imposed
 se adhik kii kharidari hui
 DGSND Director General Vinay Kumar told India Today, "government procurement has become completely transparent now through Gem
 koi bhi vibhaag jem par jaakar sabase kam daam par saamaan uplabdh karaane vaale vendor se saamaan kharid saktaa he
 These prices are available on RC, other online portals and at lower rates from the market on Gem
 isse sarkari khajaane ko karodon ru
 Will benefit " mulyon kii behatar dhang se tulana kii ja sake, isliye jem ne ''pricedekho" portal se bhi samjhauta kiya he
 But Rs 2 lakh crore
 kii kharid ko paardarshee banane vaale portal kii vishwasaneeyata par bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke saat saansadon, modi sarkaar ke ek mantri or vipaksh ke ek saansad ne vaanijya mantri nirmala sitaraman ko sambodhit patron main saikadon karod ru
 Has expressed the possibility of being a scam
 mantri-saansadon ne jataayaa sabase bade digital ghotaale kaa andeshaabihar ke mujffarpur se bhaajapa ke loksabhaa saansad ajay nishad ne sakht bhashaa main jem portal se sarkari khajaane ko baari nuksaan hone kii chetavanee di
 In a letter dated March 20 to Sitharaman, Nishad said, "there are a lot of fundamental and procedural flaws with Gem, making Gem a base of corruption for both buyers and sellers
" iske chalate kharidaaron yani centre sarkaar or uske vibhaagon ko baari aarthik nuksaan ho rahaa he
 "nishad said," There have been many cases of irregularities where the authorities have benefited from Gem's technical and procedural flaws
 yah saaf he ki dijiesendi main kuch log jaan-boojhkar aniyamittaaon se phayda uthaakar bhrashtachar kar rahe hai or sarkari khajaane ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahe hai
 "taking this point further, BJP MP from Gadchiroli in Maharashtra, Ashok M
 nete ne sitaraman ko likhaa, ''jem portal main maujuud khaamiyon ke chalate kharidaar yaa vikreta agar portal kaa durupyog karte hai to dijiesendi ke adhikariyon ke paas unke khilaaf karrwai kaa adhikaar nahin he
 This will result in corruption size of several hundred crores in the coming months
 kaa ho saktaa he
 "the mps urge the Commerce Minister to request an explanation from DGSND on the abolition of the rate contract
" "sansad kii vigyaan or praudyogiki sambandhi sthaayee samiti ke sadsy or uttar pradesh ke basti se bhaajapa ke loksabhaa saansad harish dvivedi ne 9 march, 2017 ko sitaraman ko patr likh ghotaale se aagaah kiya
 The MP wrote, "it seems that the government has started its commodity supply scheme as a pilot project by completely shutting down the DGSND rate contract of the government from the Government e Market Place or Gem Portal, but so far this The pilot project has many flaws
 
 
 iske kaaran bhavishya main centre sarkaar ko vittiya nuksaan hone kii ashanka he
 Keep the rate contract running until the Gem portal is fully developed
 " sansad kii aantarik maamalon kii sthaayee samiti ke sadsy or uttar pradesh kii mohanlalganj loksabhaa seat se bhaajapa saansad kaushal kishor ne 25 farvari ko vaanijya mantri sitaraman ko patr likhakar isi tarah kaa andeshaa jataayaa
 Kishore said, "gem has been operated as a pilot project, there are many technical and financial flaws in its operation, showing the possibility of financial loss due to not being fully transparent yet
 " portal se galat logon ke phayda uthaane kii ore ishaara karte hue kishor ne likhaa, ''jem ko or adhik paardarshee banaae jane kii jarurat he
 If this is not done, some people have become active to take advantage of it wrongly, which seems to be a great possibility of social opposition in future
 " (dekheh saansad bane vislabloar)jem kii vishwasaneeyata par sabase pehle sawaal khadey karne vaale moulik bharat trust ke nideshak anuj agarwal kehete hai, ''siddhant rup main yah vyavastha laajawab he

 This is difficult to do with international portals operating with an investment of Rs
 " takanic kii jaraa-si khami bhrashtachar kii apaar sambhavanaon ke dwaar kholti he
 And mps are pointing to the same thing
 aarasi se oonche daam par bik rahaa samanjem lagu karne kaa sabase bada aadhaar yahi bataaya gaya tha ki jem par product kii keemten aarasi kii keemton se kam rahengi
 This is significant because the government mechanism considered the purchase of RC so credible that the procurement of it was exempted from the scrutiny of CAG and CVC
 india today ko praapt dijiesendi kii aantarik report se pataa chalata he ki electronic energy meter ke chah modelon main meter kaa daam aarasi par tay kiye gaye meter ke daamon se adhik he
 Similarly, the rate of four models of electronic digital postal fracking machine was also found to be higher than the rate fixed in RC
 25 march ko jari note main dijiesendi vinay kumaar ne khud mana, ''yah chintaa kii baat he ki jem par aplod kiye gaye kai utpaadon ke daam aarasi keemton se zyada hai
 "when many products on Gem are costlier than RC even after eight months of Gem implementation, it makes no sense to make Gem mandatory in a hurry
 duusari baat yah ki is dauraan jo mahangi kharidari kii gai or sarkari khajaane par atirikt boj padaa, uski bharpai kahaan se hogi
 The DGSND and the government are silent on this entire process
 reverse biding se chhedchhad or bazaar se mahangi kharidriverse biding kaa matlab he ki koi company utpaada ko lekar apni boli lagaae or agar duusari company usase kam boli lagaati he to pehali company ko nayaa rate kot karne kaa adhikaar hota he
 There is a provision to keep the bidding process open for seven days so that every company gets a chance to bid lowest and government procurement is possible at the lowest price possible
 india today kii padtaal main agast-sitambar 2016 ke dauraan aise ek darjan se adhik maamle saamne aae, jahaan reverse biding ko saat din se pehle hi band kar diya gaya
 In these cases crores of rupees
 kii kharidari kar lee gai
 For example, when visiting Gem's archive, on September 13, 2016, the bid to buy 360 tablets was put on and the next day was closed, thus 33 without giving a chance of reverse bidding for seven days
 66 lakh ru
 k tablets were purchased
 padtaal main aise bahut-se maamle saamne aae jab kisi sarkari vibhaag ne koi saamaan jem se kharid liya, jabaki usee utpaada kii keemat nijee portal par kam he
 There are also products that are priced higher on Gem and less on private portals (see: Buy expensive on Gem, cheaper on online portal)
 darasal ho yah rahaa he ki ''pricedekho" portal alag-alag portal par ek hi model ke rate kii tulana karne kii bajaae milte-julate model ke rate jem par uplabdh kara rahaa he
 a source from DGSND said, "the problem is that the work that Amazon or other companies have done with teams of thousands and crores of rupees
 ke nivesh se bane software se karti hai, vahi kaam jem main 40-50 logon kii team or maamuli nivesh se ho rahaa he
 That is why the filters mentioned in Gem are not able to work in many cases and the path of corruption is opened
 "haalanki dijiesendi ke ek sheersh adhikari ne kaha, ''kuch bade vendor aarasi paddati main munafa kaat rahe the, unke hiton par chot padi to ve saansadon ke madhyam se lobying kara rahe hai
 "this officer may also be right
 lekin isse yah sawaal khatm nahin ho jaataa ki agast 2016 se ab tak jem par jo mahangi kharidari hui he, uski bharpai ke liye centre sarkaar kya kadam uthaati he? or ab apane mantri-saansadon ke virodh ko darkinar kar dijiesendi kaa puraa kaam jem ko saunp kar sarkaar jokhim kyon le rahi he?vaise bhi yah sidhe 2 lakh karod ru
 There is the matter of making online purchases, if someone took advantage of Jem's technical flaw then the size of this scam is 1 of the biggest alleged 2G scam in the country so far
 76 lakh karod ru
 Will be larger than the amount of Rs

 There is a lot of resentment among the families of martyrs of Gujarat for the statement of Akhilesh Yadav, former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party president, who divided the soldiers in the state for politics
 parivaar waalon kaa kahana he ki jab soljar uniform pahan letaa he to wo gujarati, marathi yaa rajasthani nahin hota
 He becomes Hindustani
 ahmedabad ke bapunagar ilaake ke rahane vaale viem ramani ne apane bete major rishikesh ko 2009 main khoyaa tha
 Major Rishikesh was leading the Punjab Regiment during the terrorist attack
 hamale main teen aatankiyon ko maarane ke baad major rishikesh shahid ho gaye
 VM Ramani is filled with indignation at the statement of Akhilesh given about the martyrs of Gujarat
 rishikesh ke parijanon kaa kahana he ki 'jo apano ko khota he, use hi pataa hota he ki shahadat kya hoti he
 'ramani says that when a soldier wears a uniform, it is not Gujarati, Marathi or Rajasthani
 wo ek hindustani ban jaataa he
 It is clear that Akhilesh is doing his politics, but his political rhetoric has hurt the martyr's family, who have seen their child, husband or father being martyred

 After fighting with Sunil Grover, it seems that Kapil Sharma's time is not going well
 sunil grover, ali asagar, chandan prabhakar kaa 'da kapil sharma sho' se bachout karne ke baad sho kii tiarapy bahut ghat gai he or ab khabar aa rahi he ki soni antertement channel 'da kapil sharma sho' ko band karne ja rahaa he
 a new show will start in place of Kapil, with Sunil Grover as the main lead
 DNA ne ek sutara ke hawaale se kaha, 'channel vaale sunil grover ke saath kapil kii hathapayee se bahut niraash hai
 The show's ratings fell higher than he thought
 aise chalata rahaa to wo kapil ko to bilkul bhi sin nahin karenge
 Maybe the entire show itself should be stopped
 'sunil grover kii vaapasi se pehle kapil sharma ne kii fees badhaane kii maang!channel sunil par focus karnaa chahta he or unke saath ek nayaa sho bananaa chahta he
 After the fight, Colors channel approached Sunil for a new show but Sunil has not signed anything yet

 Those who do not open accounts under Jan Dhan Yojana should be opened early
 isse do laabh honge
 More and more of the country's population will come in the bank network and when the black money is distributed, everyone will already have a bank account to take
 is masale par jis tarah kii kanoonee raajnneetik sakriyata dikh rahi he ab ummid kii jaani chahie ki kaala dhan aayega or aa gaya to har vyakti ko teen-teen lakh rupee milenge
 The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, promised this in his election rallies
 aa gaya yaa yaheen se nikaal liya gaya to kaala dhan hi asli jandhan ban jayega, kyonki kaala dhan kaise aayega ab isaki jaanch kii jimmedaari supreme court ne le lee he
 The court said that we will take responsibility for how the black money will come back
 aapako khataadhari logon kii chintaa karne kii zarurat nahin he, esaiti sambhaal legi
 We can no longer leave the issue of bringing black money to the government
 aise to yah hamaare samay main kabhi aayega hi nahin
 Your investigation will never be completed
 aap videsh se ai sari jaankaree or naam hamen saunp den
 The government no longer needs to worry or investigate much in this matter
 adaalat se sarkaar se un sabhi bharatiyon ke khate kii jaankaree maangi jinke videshi bainkon main khate hai
 Asked the central government, why are you becoming a protective umbrella for such people
 kyon bachaa rahe hai aise logon ko
 The Supreme Court rejected the central government's argument that disclosing the names of people deposited in foreign banks before investigation would violate foreign treaties
 aaj bhi etorni general ne court main kaha he ki agar naam saajha kiye gaye to jaanch main dikkat hogi
 Information will not be received in future and there will be trouble in bringing back black money
 jin logon ke khate main blike mani nahin he unki niztaa kaa ulanghan hoga yani naam badnaam hoga
 Making the same argument, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wrote in his blog that we will reveal the name only under the procedures of law
 lekin supreme court ne pichley kai dinon se chali aa rahi sarkaar kii daleel ko thukraa diya he or is maamle main jaanch kaa kaam bhi sarkaar se le liya he
 It is said that nothing can happen unless we monitor it
 isse bada jhatka kya ho saktaa he
 You know that when the government revealed the names of three people on Monday, there was an uproar as to what is new
 in teenon ke naam to pehle bhi saarvajanik ho chuke hai
 All three denied in front of the camera, but ADR also told that Radha Timblo, director of one of Goa's mining company Timblo Private Limited, has donated both Congress and BJP
 ek nazariyaa yah bhi ho saktaa he ki un logon ke bhi naam saarvajanik honge jo raajnneetik dalon ko chanda dekar bachane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin sawaal uthaa ki ye to chote mote naam he
 Will those elders also be caught whose slight evidence of donations is available, but people speculate about their role in the village countryside
 yachikakarta ram jethmalani, prashanth bhushan kii sakriyata kaa nateeja dikhne laga he
 Now even BJP leader Subramaniam Swamy has written a letter to the Finance Minister to tell the names of all
 adaalat ne in teenon kii baat par ek tarah se muhar laga di he
 Swami also said that France and Germany have sent these names on their own
 sarkaar kya kar rahi he mujhe nahin pataa
 i have written to the Finance Minister that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have black money stashed abroad
 lekin koi karrwai nahin hui he
 Ram Jethmalani, a suspended member of the BJP, also wrote a letter to the Finance Minister that the broker like Hasan Ali is not named in the 18 people you have given names to
 yah bahut hi durbhagyapurna he
 So, has this court decision taken off the pleas of the BJP and the government on the issue of black money
 samay kam hone yaa jaanch eemaandaaree se hone ke daavon ke naitik bal ko kamazor kiya he
 As soon as the decision came, Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal said that every black money person should be told that from the day you opened your account, give the entire bank statement till date
 jab vah puri bank statement denge to har transection main pataa chalegaa ki kisase paisa aayaa tha or kisko paisa gaya tha
 When every transaction is invested, a lot of money will come out and many new bank accounts will come out of it
 jis tarah se supreme court ne aaj rukh apanaaya he usase ek ummid kii kiran jaagi he
 Today it seems very strong decision
 pehle congress or ab bijepi donon kaala dhan waalon ko naam chhupaati he or bachaati hui nazar aa rahi he
 Congress spokesman Ajay Maken said that in 2011, Arun Jaitley used to say that there is no problem in giving names due to tax agreement with foreign countries, why he is now saying that it is difficult
 maakan ne kaha ki hamen khushi he ki supreme court ne bharat sarkaar ke donon halafname ko asweekaar karte hue kaha he ki saare naamon kii suchi supreme court ko di jaani chahie

 Addressing a public meeting in Karnal, Haryana, Congress President Gandhi said that if this time his party wins the Lok Sabha elections, they will dissolve the NITI Aayog
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki niti ayog ko bhang karne ke saath hi yojana ayog ko behaal kiya jayega
 It will have select economists and fewer than 100 staff
 is dauraan unhone aarope lagaaya ki niti ayog ke paas pradhanmantri ke liye marketing karne or farji aankade taiyaar karne ke sivaay koi kaam nahin hai
 Let us tell you that after coming to power, Prime Minister Narendra Modi dissolved the Planning Commission on January 1, 2015 and replaced it with the NITI Aayog
 niti ayog ke adhyaksh pradhanmantri hai
 The Governing Council of NITI Aayog consists of Chief Ministers of all states, Lt

 Rahul said that PM Modi protects the rich, while avoiding the help of debt-laden farmers

 com / mzjhg8o0yl In the case of death of 11 people in Burari, Delhi Police has received reports of mobile call details of Bhatia family members
 jisase police ko is baat kaa pataa chal gaya he ki maut se pehle aakhir lalit ne kise phone kiya tha
 When the Crime Branch of Delhi Police, which was investigating the Burari case, investigated the call details of the Jabhatia family, it was found that Lalit, the master mind of the entire scandal, had made the last call to his contractor before his death
 jabaki uske parivaar ke baaki sadasyon ne bhi marane se pehle raat 8 se 9 baje ke bich ek yaa do alag-alag numberon par kol kiye the
 Actually, the CDR of Lalit and his family members can prove to be crucial in solving the case to the Crime Branch
 police sabhi numberon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Also, the police came to know that on June 30, the day of the incident, a page was written in the register
 jisame likhaa tha mangal, budh, shukr, shani
 However, the crime branch is yet to be understood
 saath hi police ko jaanch main pataa chalaa ki 24 june se lekar 29 june tak har raat bhaatia parivaar ghar main anushthan ke naam par maut kii reharsal kiya karata tha
 All 11 members of the family practiced hanging like banyan tree twigs in the hall from which their corpses were found
 ye sab wo lalit ke kehane par karte the
 The hangers bought the hanging
 fande par jhulane ke liye stool gharavaale lekar aae
 The diary written in the manner of dying was also found in the house
 das mobile, ek ypad, 65 hazaar nakad or tamaam zevar ghar main hi pade mili
 Neither did anyone enter the house from outside nor did anyone go out of the house
 maut se pehle 6 din tak maut kaa reharsal hua
 Then on the seventh day, death became a reality
 tamaam saboot, tamaam tasviren, tamaam halaat sirf or sirf yahi kah rahe hai ki buraadi ke us ghar main tees june kii raat gyaarah logon kii maut khudakushi ke alaava kuch nahin
 Sources in the Crime Branch of Delhi Police say that no outsider is behind this mass death
 haalanki iske saath hi police kaa ye bhi kahana he ki gyaarah ke gyaarah log ek saath marane ko taiyaar nahin the
 This work was just a product of two minds
 ek lalit doosraa uski patni tina
 After the investigation so far, whatever clues have been found in the hands of the police and after the people who have been questioned, the police sources have claimed that a total of six nights before the night of June 30, a similar rehearsal had taken place
 or maut ke is reharsal main bhaatia parivaar ke gyaarah ke gyaarah logon ne hissaa liya tha
 According to police sources, this house used to have a special ritual every night from 24 June
 har raat anushthan ke baad puraa parivaar bargad ke ped kii tahaniyon kii tarah isi haul main isi tarah latakane kaa abhyaas kiya karata tha
 The only difference was that then everyone had their hands and feet and ears and mouths open
 yahaan tak ki pairon ke neeche koi neeche koi stool yaa kursi bhi nahin hoti
 The feet would have stayed on the ground
 haalanki fanda gale main zarur hota tha
 According to police sources, this process of hanging like banyan tree twigs continued for 6 days from June 24 to June 29
 lalit ne 6 dinon kii is kriya ke baad puure parivaar ko ye yakeen dilaa diya tha ki isse naa sirf moksh milegaa, balki parivaar kii shakti bhi badhegi
 In this way 6 days of rehearsal of death passed
 ab saatven din yani 30 june kii raat ko lalit aakiri baar diary likhata he
 This time in the diary, he mentions this last action to be held on the night of 30 June

 Rahul Gandhi is teaching the lesson of positive thinking to the Congress spokespersons gathered from all over the country in Delhi

 Rahul said that there is a need to fight not to be afraid but to bring out the truth
 rahul ne soch ko badalane or sakaaratmak soch ke saath desh main badlaav laane kii baat kahi
 In this school of Rahul, Congress workers will also be trained to use social media
 taaki chunaav ko lekar chhide sibar war main congress majbootee se takkar de sake
 Significantly, the Congress has convened a workshop of more than 100 spokespersons from all over the country in Delhi

 lekin guuruuvaar subah jab congress kaa aadesh aayaa to uske kuch der baad hi pravaktaa raashid alvi hamaare news channel ajtak par charchaa main hissaa lene pahunche
 However, as soon as his turn came to speak, Rashid Alvi woke up saying that he had just received information about the party's decision, so he is leaving the debate in the middle

 Let me tell you that the Congress party has again suffered a crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 2014 main congress 44 or 2019 main congress 52 ke aankade par simat gai he
 After this, the party has decided on Thursday morning that no spokesperson of the party will be involved in TV debates for the next one month
 unhone tivi channel ke editors se bhi apil kii he ki unke party ke pravaktaaon ko apni dibet main naa bulaaen
 Rating: a star Ramgopal Varma's Satya created a rage in 1998 and introduced a new face to the underworld in Bollywood
 is film ke baad unhone company or sarkaar jaisi behtareen filmein deen
 For the past few days, he was enthusiastic about Satya-2
 lekin film raamu ke naam ek or asafalataa jodatii najar aati he
 He made one try but like all his previous attempts, he disappointed
 film kisi bhi myanon main apni pichhali film se conect nahin karti or darshakon ko kisi bhi tarah se khud se jodne kaa kaam nahin karti he
 It would not be wrong to say that if Satya was a milestone in Bollywood, this film is one that Bollywood would not like to remember
 film dekhakar to yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki vah apana jaadui sparsh kho baithe hai
 How young the story is, he dreams of being covered in the underworld
 bas vah apane is khwab ko puraa karne ke liye aage badhata he or mumbai aata he
 But there is so much drama in the story that it does not connect anywhere, and at one point of time it seems cumbersome
 film kaa ek bhi sitara kuch kamaal nahin karata he
 Punit Singh does not leave any effect anywhere else

 Ramu appears to be somewhat confused throughout the film, and the story never gets on track
 isliye kamai ke maamle main film ke bahut saubhagyashaalee rahane kii ummid kam hi he
 It would not be wrong to say that Ramu faced a lot of criticism by making a remake of Sholay
 ab unhone 15 saal baad satya kaa sikwel banaakar bhi kuch aisa hi kar dikhaaya he
