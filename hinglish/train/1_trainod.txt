 In countries like Syria and Iraq, there is no shortage of suicide bombers and even innocent human bombs thanks to ISIS
 lekin haal ke dinon main ye pehla mauka he, jab iraq main police ne ek aise maasoom maanav bam ko kaabo karne main kamyaabi hasil kii he, jo aatankiyon ke ishaare par apane jism par barood baandh kar begunaahon ko maut ke ghat utaarne aayaa tha
 Know how it was possible and how it was caught alive and innocent human bomb? a gunpowder belt is tied in the stomach of the child
 This white color band, which is loaded with gunpowder, is tied in the child's belly
 darasal, ye belt hi maut kaa wo saamaan he jo sirf is bachche ko hi nahin, balki iske aas-paas maujuud tamaam logon ko bas hi jatke main uda saktaa he
 Because it is not an innocent child, but the human bomb of ISIS, which was designed by the world's most maligned terrorist organization, and left it in the city of Kirkuk to kill innocent people
 lekin isse pehle ki wo apane is iraade main kaamyaab ho paata, pulisavaalon ko isaki harkaton par shaq ho gaya or bam ko datonet karne yaa phodne se pehle hi use daboch liya gaya
 The biggest challenge was to defuse the bomb
 Now that the case was very serious in itself, the policemen first grabbed both the hands of the child tightly so that he could not press the switch in his body at any cost, so that the ammo filled this The belt exploded and caused havoc
 lekin ye oparation sirf is bachche ko kaabo kar lene bhar se mukammal nahin ho saktaa tha
 Rather, it was a big challenge before the policemen to separate this bomb from the child's body and defuse it
 kyonki fidaayin hamalaavaron yaa maanav bamon ke maamle main aisa aksar dekha gaya he, jab khud maanav bamon se pehle remote thame maanav bamon ke aakaa aise aatankwaadiyon ko apane haathon se uda dete hai
 a minor mistake meant that the bomb disposal squad of the Iraqi army was immediately called to the scene in view of the chance of death
 or vahaan aate hi skhwaid ke log bachche ke jism par lagi barood se bhari wo safed rang kii pattee utaarne main jute gaye
 But this work is very dangerous, because even a minor mistake in this work means only and only death
 phir chaahe wo galati bam main lage switch ke dabane kii ho, kisi takneekee kharabi se bam datonet hone yaa phir aas-paas remote liye maujuud kisi or aatankwaadi ke remote dabaa dene kii
 This bomb can cause great devastation
 udhar, dur se logon kii bheed dil tham kar lagaataar ye rongte khadey karanevaala manjar ko dekh rahi thi
 
 
 Here, as soon as this belt was removed from the child's body by way of foot, due to the success of the operation, people started cheering
 kirkuk ke ye halaat kitne bhayanak hai, iskaa andaaza isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki is maasoom maanav bam ke pakade jane se pehle hi is shahar main do fidaayin hamale ho chuke hai
 Whereas before the child would succeed in his intention, the policemen caught him
 iraq kaa sirf ye iklauta baccha bam hi nahin, balki iesas lambey samay se bacchon ke dimag main jehar bharne main laga he
 He is engaged in casting him in the mold of horror
 yahi vajah he ki syria or iraq jaise mulkon main iesas ke changul main funs kar ab bhi saikadon bachche us umr main marane-maarane kaa sabak sikh rahe hai, jis umr main insaan ko thik se jeena tak nahin aata
 How dreadful isis's plan for Islamic rule can be gauged from the fact that it has been able to kidnap and terrorize children from the age of eight
 saaf he ki iesas kii is fouj main shaamil hone kaa sirf or sirf ek hi matlab he, wo he maut
 Then whether these deaths came while fighting on behalf of ISIS or whether the crime of leaving ISIS should be done by ISIS itself

 This view was seen in the Rajya Sabha during the Question Hour, when Piyush Goyal was answering supplementary questions related to the supply of electricity to SP member Naresh Aggarwal's villages in Uttar Pradesh
 sabhapati ne sapa sadasyon se sanyam baratane or sansadeey shabdon kaa istemaal karne ko kaha
 Naresh Aggarwal and Neeraj Shekhar, including other SP members, alleged that the minister's reply was not correct
 isi kram main unhone kuch aise shabdon kaa prayog kiya jis par sadan main maujuud do anya kendriya mantriyon nitin gadakari or uma bharti ne bhi aapatti jataai
 Gadkari said that if the member feels that the minister's reply is wrong, then he can give notice of breach of privilege
 ansaari ne sadasyon se sahyog karne kii apil karte hue kaha ki ek yaa do sawaalon main hi zyada samay nahin laga diya janaa chahie or anya sadasyon ko bhi apane sawaal poochne kaa mauka milanaa chahie
 The minister in his written reply had said, 'as per the information given by the Uttar Pradesh government, as on 1 April 2015, there were 1529 villages in Uttar Pradesh which were not electrified
 dinaank 17 july, 2016 kii sthiti ke anusaar deen dayaal upaadhyaay gram jyoti yojana ke tahat 1356 gaanvon main vidyutikaran ke kaary puure kar die gaye hai
 The remaining non-electrified villages are targeted to be electrified before May, 2018
 ' agarwal ne kaha ki is jawaab ke anusaar 200 se bhi kam gaanv gaiyr-vidyutikrut hai, jo sahi nahin he
 He accused the government and the minister of bringing the state government into disrepute
 tippaniyan On this, Goyal said that SP members are mixing two subjects - electrification and intensive electrification of villages
 unhone kaha ki aankade rajya sarkaar dwaara die gaye jate hai or ye centre sarkaar ke aankade nahin hai
 He said that the Center has accepted the data given by the state government
 mantri ke jawaab se asantosh jataate hue sapa sadasyon ne sadan se vakout kiya
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The Chairman asked the SP members to exercise restraint and use parliamentary words
 naresh agarwal or niraj shekhar sahit anya sapa sadasyon kaa aarope tha ki mantri kaa jawaab sahi nahin he
 In the same sequence, he used some words to which two other Union ministers present in the House, Nitin Gadkari and Uma Bharti, also objected
 gadakari ne kaha ki agar sadsy ko lagata he ki mantri kaa jawaab galat he, to ve visheshadhikaar hanan kaa notice de sakate hai
 Ansari appealed to the members to cooperate and said that one or two questions should not be spent too much and other members should also get a chance to ask their questions
 mantri ne apane likhit jawaab main kaha tha, 'uttar pradesh sarkaar dwaara di gai soochna ke anusaar, 1 april, 2015 kii sthiti ke anusaar uttar pradesh main 1529 gaanv aise the jo vidyutikrut nahin the

 Agarwal said that according to this reply less than 200 villages are un-electrified, which is not correct

 The comments is par goyal ne kaha ki sapa sadsy do vishyon - vidyutikaran or gaanvon ke gahan vidyutikaran ko aapas main mila rahe hai
 He said that the figures are given by the state government and these are not the figures of the central government

 There have been earthquakes in Kangra twice within four days
 jab vaigyanikon ne bukamp kaa centre dekha to unki ruh kaanp uthi
 Because the epicenter of the earthquake was in the vicinity of the same place where the terrible storm came in April 1905
 vaigyanikon ne ashanka vyakt kii he ki ek baar phir bilkul vaisaa hi bukamp aa saktaa he
 At midnight of July 13, at 11
20, the earth suddenly shook in Kangra
 log gharon se baahar aa gaye
 Unknown fear was on everyone's face and chaos was afoot all around
 kangra main aae is bukamp kii tivrata richter scale par 4
 5 measured
 ye koi bada bukamp nahin tha, isse koi nuksaan bhi nahin hua, is khabar se to aap raahat kii saans le sakate hai, lekin ye bukamp mahaj ek sandesh tha
 You will be shaken knowing that the alarm of the great danger has been sounded
 jis ilaake main ye bukamp aayaa he, or jahaan iskaa centre he, usne vaigyanikon kii neend uda di he
 a devastating earthquake occurred here in 1905, 108 years ago
 jisamen 20 hajaar se zyada log maare gaye the or puraa himachal tabah ho gaya tha

 5 kii tivrata kaa bukamp 1905 ke mahavinashkari bhuncup ke centre ke paas hi aayaa he
 This is the biggest concern

 Within the last ten days, five mild earthquakes have been recorded in several areas of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal and Uttarakhand
 bhuvaigyanikon ke mutabik kangra himalay kaa wo ilaaka he jahaan par 8 yaa isse zyada kii tivrata kaa bukamp aane kii ashanka lagaataar bani hui he
 In fact, the Himalayas were formed by a collision between two large tectonic plates of the earth
 takreeban paanch karod saal pehle tectonic platon ke bich shuru hui takkar aaj bhi jari he
 This is the reason that large earthquakes in the Himalayan region are not new
 pichley saalon main aae bade bukampon kaa adhyayan karne ke baad bhuvaigyanik is nattejey par sahamat hai ki himalay main ek bada bukamp kabhi bhi aa saktaa he
 Recently, scientists from Stanford University of America, in a study with the Indian Institute of NGRI, have found that the main Himalayan thrust in the Himalayas, MHT is very active
 yahaan par aise sanket mil rahe hai ki richter scale par 8 yaa isse zyada kii tivrata kaa bukamp kabhi bhi tabaahi machaa saktaa he
 According to experts, the major earthquakes that are prone to earthquakes of magnitude 8 or more are the areas which are Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Nepal, the lowland area of bihar and Assam
 vaigyanikon kahana he ki jis bukamp kii ashanka jataai ja rahi he, agar wo aayaa to himalay se sate tamaam ilaakon main mahavinaash kii sthiti ban sakati he
 The National Disaster Management Team has warned the Himachal Pradesh government, seeing the danger of a massive tremor
 vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki pahari ilaakon main bani imaaraten bukamp ke jatke jhel nahin saktin
 Talking about Shimla, it has a population of three lakhs
 aise main agar mahabukamp aayaa to mahavinaash ko rokna asambhav hoga
 Scientists believe that where a devastating earthquake occurs once, a similar earthquake remains in danger after a hundred years
 1905 main himachal main aae bukamp ko 103 saal ho bhi gaye hai
 103 years ago, the earthquake in Himachal caused severe destruction
 4 april, 1905 ko kangra vaili main aae bukamp kaa maap richter scale par 7
 8 was judged
 bhuvaigyanikon ke mutabik kangra ghati ke bukamp ke do centre the
 One center was in Kangra Kullu and the other in mussoorie-dehradun area
 is bukamp se kai jagah bhuskhalan hue, chattaane gir gayi
 All the buildings in Dharamshala town were frozen
 maclodganj or kangra main zyaadaatar imaaraten dhwast gayi thim
 According to the British Gazetteer, this earthquake had shown its devastation till kullu-manali, Shimla, Sirmaur and Dehradun
 agar is tarah kaa vinaashkari bukamp aayaa, jisaki vaigyanik ashanka jataa rahe hai to ve ilaake tahas nahas ho jaaenge, jo himalay se kareeb hai
 But there is also a big truth that there is no part of India that is completely safe from earthquake
 yahaan tak ki dilli main bhi aa saktaa he 7
 Earthquake of magnitude 9
 bukamp ke maddenzar hindustan ko chaar hisson main baanta gaya he
 Seismic zone 5 is the most dangerous area in terms of earthquake
 is kshetra main 8 se zyaada tivrata kaa bukamp aa saktaa he
 After which the most frightening picture of the catastrophe can be revealed
 is jone main desh kaa puraa north east ilaaka, jammu-kashmir, himachal pradesh or uttaranchal ke ilaake, gujarat kaa kuccha, uttar bihar or andaman nicobar dweep aata he
 Number two is the areas where 7
 9 kii tivrata kaa bukamp aa saktaa hesh in ilaakon ko sismik zone 4 main rakhaa gaya he
 It includes the capital Delhi, NCR, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, UP, Bihar and West Bengal, some parts of Gujarat and Maharashtra and Rajasthan adjacent to the west coast
 sismik zone 3 main un ilaakon ko rakhaa gaya he jo bukamp ke lihaaz se kuch kam khatare vaale kshetra hai
 It includes the remaining areas of Kerala, Goa, Lakshadeep, UP, Gujarat and West Bengal, Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka
 desh ke baaki ilaakon ko sismik zone 2 rakhaa gaya he jahaan 4
 There is no possibility of earthquake of more than 9
 lihaaja bukamp ke khatre ko halke main lenaa budhimaani nahin hogi
 Recently, the stir in the Himalayas is alerting us
 jarurat is baat kii he ki bade bukamp ko lekar apni taiyaariyaan tej kar den
 The state finance ministers' group has rejected the proposal to impose cess of Rs 3 per kg in addition to GST on sugar
 yah upabhoktaaon ke liye ek badi raahat he
 The Food Ministry had proposed to introduce such cess
 khaadya mantralay kaa prastaav tha ki aarthik rup se pareshaan ganna kisaanon or chini milon ko raahat dene ke liye is tarah kaa ses (upkar) lagaaya jaae
 But the group, headed by Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, rejected the proposal after discussing it for nearly three months
 6,700 karod rupee jutaney kii thi yojanakhaadya mantralayake prastaav par vichaar karne ke liye jiesti parishad ne is saal may maheene main ek mantri samooh (gom) kaa gathan kiya tha
 According to the proposal, if a cess of three rupees per kg is levied in addition to the GST of 5 per cent currently being imposed on sugar, then it can create a fund of Rs 6,700 crore
 mantralay kaa kahana tha ki is nidhi kaa istemaal kisaanon or chini milon kii mushkil dinon main madad ke liye kii ja sakati he
 But the BJP and the central government, which is preparing for the 2019 elections, may have understood that this step could put a lot of burden on the common man
 chini main prati kilo 3 rupee kii badhat karnaa badi baat he
 According to sources, the gom also noted that the sugar millgana delays payment to farmers
 kuch maheenon pehle ganna kisaanon kaa chini milon par bakaayaa 23,000 karod rupee tak pahunch gaya tha
 It is believed that the resentment created is also a reason for bjp's defeat in Kairana by-election
 lekin ab chini ke liye nunatam samarthan mulya 29 rupee prati kilo tay ho jane ke baad ganna kisaanon kaa bakaayaa ghatakar 5,000 karod rupee tak aa gaya he
 However, the gom is also considering other measures to provide relief to sugarcane farmers and sugar mills
 ek prastaav yah he ki 1 fisadi kaa lagjri tex lagaaya jaae

 While the Congress did not get a single seat
 aise main congress ke saamne jahaan khaataa kholane kii badi chunauti he

 See full recruitment notification here amejan prime kii nai web siries 'mirzapur' dekhte hi dekhte charchaa kaa vishay ban gai he
 The series premiered on 16 November
 darshak mirzapur par kaaphi baat kar rahe hai
 This web series is being discussed for a specific reason
 mirzapur rivyuu-1: bematlab kii hinsa or kahani main bikharaav ne kiya nirashamirzapur main gajagamini gupta urf golu kaa kirdaar nibhaane vaali shweta treepathi ke upar seen kiya he
 This scene is being discussed a lot on social media
 yah seen duusare episod main aata he jab golu kii bahan use talash rahi hoti he or vah librari main koi kaamuk kitaab pard kar aahen bhar rahi hoti dikhti hai
 Review 2: How is Pankaj Tripathi and Ali Fazal's Mirzapur in acting? Golu's sister Sweety, who she meets in one corner of the library, is sweating
 jab uski bahan usase puuchhati he ki kya use sari duniya kii jaankaree mil gai he? to golu jawaab detii he- haa didi, swarg kii to mil hi gai
 This scene does not look like the way Gajagamini's character is in the series
 seen ko lekar shweta ne kya kaha?is seen ko lekar shweta ne kaha, "mahilaon ko purush pasand hai, unamem sexual icchhaaen hoti hai or isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 When i read this scene and understood the whole graph and the story of Mirzapur, i did not think about this scene and its boldness even for 2 seconds
 yah mere liye rojaanaa coffee pine jitna hi saamaanya tha
 "but i do not understand the meaning of erotic scenes inside the library in Mirzapur
 Review 3: ali fazal, pankaj treepathi kii web siries mirzapur main kahaan ho gai chook?agar pichhali kuch filmon or web siries par gaur karen to masterbation yaa kaamuk seen fishan kii tarah najar aate hai
 Masterbation scenes were also seen in the web series "luststories" and "veere the Wedding"
 is par kaaphi vivaad bhi hua tha
 However, these scenes were justifying the character and the story
 donon kahaniyon main aisi mahilaayein thi jo pati ke jariye apni sexual needs puri nahin kar paati hai
 Swara Bhaskar, Kiara Advani and Neha Dhupia have done such scenes before Shweta

 vedanti ne kaha ki raja vikramaditya ne jo ram mandir banwaaya tha vah mandir lakhanu se dikhataa tha
 When Babar climbed the Attalika in Lucknow and looked towards the east, he saw two moons
 babaar ne poocha ki yahaan 2 chand kaise dikhaai de rahe hai
 On this, Mir Baqi told that the temple of Ayodhya was built by Vikramaditya and there is a Chandrakanta gem on the top of the temple
 chandrakanta mani kaa prakaash lakhanu tak jaataa tha

 '' pulavama hamale ke baad ek taraf jahaan deshbhar main pakistan ke khilaaf gussa bharaa he, vahiin duusari taraf raajnneeti bhi jari he
 Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Sambit Patra has broken the silence on the allegations made by the Congress on the central government over the Pulwama terror attack
 paatra ne ki shahadat par congress ko raajnneeti nahin kerani chahie
 This is a time when all people should stand united and stand with the country
 paatra ne shuukravaar ko press conference kar kaha ki vipaksh ko desh ke samarthan main pradhanmantri or sena ke saath khadaa hona chahie lekin congress siyasat kar rahi he
 It is being exploited in Pakistan and Pakistan channels are making head lines
 paatra ne kaha ki bharat kii raajnneetik party ke jo netaa twit karte hai, wo pakistan main charchaa kaa vishay bane hue hai
 Sambit Patra said that the tweets of both Congress leaders Manish Tiwari and Shashi Tharoor are in opposition to India
 manish tiwari ne pani rokane kii baat par jo bayaan diya ki isamen koi dam nahin he
 Pakistan's head line remains
 sambit paatra ne kaha, congress ne kaha tha ki ham is par raajnneeti nahin karenge lekin uske baavjood raajnneeti shuru kar di he
 Let me tell you that Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted that not playing with Pakistan in the World Cup would be worse than surrender
 Our government did not even declare national mourning wants to cancel a match 3 months from now? Is that a serious response to 40 lives taken in cold blood? BJP wants2divert attn from its own fecklessness&inept handling of the crisis

 co / kjzjavdx72— Shashi Tharoor (@shashitharoor)february 22, 2019paatra ne kaha ki kam samay main bharat kii sarkaar ne pakistan ko kadaa jawaab diya he
 The resolution was passed for the first time in the United Nations Council, in which the name of jaish-e-mohammed has come
 tamaam desh bharat ke saath khadey hai
 China has also supported India regarding terrorism but sadly some political parties of the country are doing politics on this issue
 bijepi pravaktaa paatra ne kaha ki ham pakistan se bhi lard legein
 Even before this, India has taught Pakistan a lesson, but regrettably the country's enemies are inside the country
 congress pulavama main shahid hone vaale javaanon kii jati or dharm ke bare main pataa laga rahi he
 The army belongs to the entire country, so its caste and religion cannot be seen
 sambit paatra ne kaha ki pradhanmantri modi baar-baar kah chuke hai ki jo aag aapke dil main he vah mere dil main he
 The sorrow you have is also me
 sambit paatra ne kaha ki vipakshi partiyaan is hamale ko 2019 loksabhaa chunaav se jodakar iskaa puraa raajnneetikaran karne kii koshish kar rahi hai, yah thik nahin he
 Explain that after the Pulwama attack, opposition parties are targeting the central government that there has been an increase in terrorist attacks in the Modi government
 2015 ko puraa hone main abhi ek maheene se zyada kaa vakt baaki he, lekin vanade cricket main ye saal ballebaajon kaa saal sabit ho rahaa he
 At least two figures in the ODI match played between England and Pakistan in Abu Dhabi only prove this
 england kii pari main jos butler ne tufaani andaaj main 8 chakke thok die
 This is the record for the most sixes in ODI cricket by any batsman from England
 lekin unke chhakkon kii badaulat ek nayaa international record bhi ban gaya
 This year has also proved to be the year of sixes in international cricket, that is, this year, the maximum number of sixes in ODI International has taken place
 2015 main ab tak vanade cricket main 1933 chakke lage hai
 Earlier in 2014, ODI cricket had 1928 sixes
 jos butler or jesan raay ke shatakon kii badaulat england ne pakistan ke khilaaf 50 overon main 5 wicket par 355 ran thok die
 These runs proved to be enough for the Pakistan batsmen
 tippaniyan Actually this is the 19th time in international cricket this season, when a team has scored more than 350 runs in their innings
 2015 main khele gaye vanade muqablon main ab tak 19 baar timen apni pari main 350 ran kaa aankada paar kar chuki hai
 Earlier the second best performance was in 2007, when teams crossed the 350-run mark in 9 odis
 is hisaab se dekhen to 2015 main 2007 ke muqaabale main dogune se bhi zyada baar timen 350 ranon kaa score bana chuki hai
 Obviously these two figures made in the year 2015 in International ODI cricket prove the dominance of batsmen
 
 
 or isse ye samajhnaa mushkil nahin he ki nae niyamon se ballebaazon ko zyada faaydaa ho rahaa he
 In England's innings, Joss Butler hit 8 sixes in a stormy manner
 ye england kii ore se kisi bhi ballebaaj kii ore se vanade cricket main sabase zyada chhakkon kaa record he
 But his sixes also created a new international record
 antarrashtriya cricket main ye saal chhakkon kaa bhi saal sabit hua he, yani vanade international main sabase zyada chakke isi saal lage hai
 In 2015, there have been 1933 sixes in ODI cricket
 isse pehle 2014 main vanade cricket main 1928 chakke lage the
 With centuries from Joss Butler and Jason Rai, England hit 355 for 5 in 50 overs against Pakistan
 ye ran pakistan ke ballebaajon ke liye kaaphi sabit hue
 The comments darasal ye is sijan international cricket main 19waan mauka he, jab kisi team ne apni pari main 350 se zyada ran bana die hai
 In the one-day matches played in 2015, teams have crossed the mark of 350 runs in their innings so far 19 times
 isse pehle doosraa sabase behatar pradarshan 2007 main tha, jab 9 baar vanade muqaabale main tiimon ne 350 ranon kaa aankada paar kiya tha
 According to this, in 2015, more than twice the teams have scored 350 runs as compared to 2007
 jaahir he international vanade cricket main saal 2015 main bane ye do aankade ballebaazon ke dabadabe ko sabit karte hai
 
 
 And it is not difficult to understand that batsmen are benefitting more from the new rules
 lekin unke chhakkon kii badaulat ek nayaa international record bhi ban gaya
 This year has also proved to be the year of sixes in international cricket, that is, this year, the maximum number of sixes in ODI International has taken place

 Mayawati said, even after BSP was supporting in Rajasthan, the allegation of betrayal was done
 
 darasal, rajasthan main 6 basapa vidhayak somvaar ko congress main shaamil ho gaye
 On this, Mayawati said that this is a fraud
 unhone kaha, bispi movement ke saath aisa vishwasghaat dobaaraa tab kiya gaya he jab bispi vahaan congress sarkaar ko baahar se bina shart samarthan de rahi thi
 Mayawati said that instead of fighting with its rival parties and organizations, the Congress everywhere works to harm those parties which support and support them
 congress anusuchit jati-janajati or pichhadaa virdohi party he
 Congress is always Baba Saheb Dr
 bhimrao ambedkar or unki maanavtaavaadi vichaardhaara kii virdohi rahi
 Mayawati said, it was because of the Congress that Baba Saheb had to resign from the post of Law Minister and it was because of the Congress that Baba Saheb could never come to the Lok Sabha by electing him, nor did the Congress give him the Bharat Ratna
 bataa den, rajasthan main basapa pramukh mayawati ko bada jhatka dete hue unke sabhi chah vidhayak congress main shaamil ho gaye hai
 With this, the total number of Congress mlas in the Assembly has increased to 106

 isse pehle congress rashtriya lok dal (ralod) ke ek vidhayak, basapa ke chah or 12 nirdaleey vidhayakon ke samarthan se sarkaar chalaa rahi thi
 (from input agency) congress ke saath gathbandhan par vichaar-vimarsh karne ke liye rajd adhyaksh lalu prasad ke dilli ravaanaa hone ke saath hi bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha ki upie sahyogi ke taur par unka gathbandhan swaabhaavik he lekin jad-you ke liye yah chintaa kii baat nahin he
 On the sidelines of a program of All India Builders Organization, Kumar told reporters, "the alliance between them is natural and there is nothing big about it
" ve pehle se hi upie ke sahyogi rahe hai
 Kumar said that this is not a concern for his party as his party is running with the support of the people
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki logon ne unki sarkaar ko jo jimmedaari di he use vah nibhaa rahe hai or agar yah kaam gambhirtha se ho rahaa he to log unka phir se samarthan karenge
 With the RJD president leaving for the national capital for talks, Congress leaders there are indicating signs of an alliance with the RJD, Congress and LJP
 makapa, bhakpa-maale or ensipi bhi is gathbandhan main shaamil ho sakate hai

 During that time too, Yasin resorted to fake identity cards

 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MP Vijay Bahadur Singh found it overwhelming to justify Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's 'dog-boy' remark and was expelled by party supremo Mayawati

 Hussain said that no one pressured him to resign
 unhone kaha, main nahin samajhataa ki 'piem-in-vatting' ke taur par khud ko project karne se kisi ko desh kii 15 fisadi aabaadi ko naaraaz karne kii chhot mil jaati he
 Earlier, Hussain also allegedly said in a TV interview that Narendra Modi, who was elected the chairman of the BJP Election Committee, cannot escape the responsibility of the Gujarat riots
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki vah chaahate hai ki varisht party netaa laalkrishna adwani yaa vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ko party kii ore se pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar hon
 The comments ullekhneey he ki narendra modi ne samachar agency royatres ko die saakshaatkaar main 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke sandarbh main kaha tha, yadi main car kii pichhali seat par hum or kute kaa ek baccha pahiye ke neeche aa jaae, to kya mujhe dukh nahin hoga

 hossain ne kaha ki istipha dene ke liye un par kisi ne dabaav nahin daalaa tha
 He said, i do not think that projecting yourself as 'pm-in-waiting' allows anyone to annoy the 15% population of the country

 He also said that he wants senior party leader LK Advani or Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj to be the party's prime ministerial candidate

 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne kaha ki dakshin africa kii paristhitiyon main teji or oochaal se saamanjasy bithaana unki yuva team ke liye badi chunauti hogi, jise yahaan teen vanade or do test match khilne hai
 Dhoni said on the eve of the first ODI, the biggest challenge is to adjust to the boom and the boom
 yadi aap antarrashtriya cricket main nae hai, to yah badi chunauti ban jaati he
 The reason behind this is that you do not get such speed and bounce even on the best wicket in India
 unhone kaha, isliye jin khilaadiyon ne abhi antarrashtriya cricket main padaarpan kiya ho, unke liye yah thodaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Dhoni, however, believes that there are some players in his team who have international experience
 unhone kaha, lekin hamaare paas kuch khilaadi aise hai, jo pichley kuch satr se khel rahe hai or unhone duniya bhar main acha pradarshan kiya he
 When you play on the same ground, you know how the conditions will be and it benefits
 aakhir main anubhav myne rakhata he
 The series will witness a clash between Indian batsmen and South African bowlers
 dhoni ne kaha, ballebaajon ke khilaaf hameshaa ranneetiyaan banaai jaati hai
 Batsmen also make their own strategy to deal with bowlers
 mukhya chunauti yah he ki aap bhinn paristhitiyon ke anuroop apana khel kaise dhaalte hai
 More important than strategies is who scores more runs and who takes more wickets
 bhartiya gendbaaji ko dakshin africa kii tulana main kamjor mana ja rahaa he, lekin dhoni ne kaha, mahatvapurn yah he ki aap paristhitiyon kaa kaisaa phayda uthaate hai
 Dhoni said, it is not important that you have the best bowlers
 mujhe lagata he ki hamane acha pradarshan kiya he
 There are ups and downs
 jab maidan par os hoti he yaa wicket bilkul sapaat hoti he, to hamen sachmuch sangharsh karnaa padataa he
 This is an area in which our bowlers have not performed very well
 unhone kaha, lekin agar unhen madad milti he, to tej gendbaaj ho yaa spinner, unhone iskaa phayda uthaaya he or acha pradarshan kiya he
 So we are happy with what he did
 utaar-chadhaav se ham khush hai
 Dhoni admitted that he has not seen the pitch
 unhone kaha, aap kahin bhi khel rahe hai, agar aapane wicket bachaae hai, to antim aath se 10 over main achche ran bana sakate hai
 Wickets in the subcontinent slow down and sometimes it is not easy for the new batsman to come and play the shot immediately
 aise halaat main ham pratispardhi score nahin bana pate
 He said, if there is good bounce and speed, then we have seen that batsmen score runs in the last eight to 10 overs and they score strong
 bhartiya captain ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki dakshin africa aisa sthaan hai, jahaan yah kaaphi had tak nirbhar karata he ki halaat kaise hai, wicket kaise taiyaar kiya gaya he or badal chhaae hai yaa dhoop khili he, jab wicket ballebaaji ke liye acha hota he
 Much depends on how the situation is on that day
 yah tathy he ki bharat shrunkhlaa main duniya kii number ek vanade team ke rup main utrega, lekin yah bhi tathy he ki bharat ne dakshin africa main kabhi dwipaksheeya shrunkhlaa nahin jiti he or vanade main unka record bhi kharaab he
 Dhoni said, it is not a matter of strong contender
 kharaab record hamaare jehan main nahin he, lekin aise udhaaharan hai, jab hamaare paas shrunkhlaa jeene kaa mauka tha, lekin hamane iskaa phayda nahin uthaaya, isliye yah kaaphi mahatvapurn he ki aap us din kaisaa khel dikhaate hai
 We have seen that in odis you need a good start
 do nai gend ke niyam se or visheshkar agar halaat tej gendbaajon ke anukool hon, to yah ahm he ki aap pehle 10 over main kaise khelte hai
 a competitive score can be scored in the last 15 overs when the wicket is in hand

 wo din gaye jab purushon or mahilaon kii pahchaan unke kapadon se kii jaati thi
 The skirt was known for women and trousers for men
 samaaj main parush or mahilaon ke liye alag- alag tarah ke kapade taiyaar kiye jate the
 Although women can still wear many types of clothes
 lekin purush samaaj ke dar se chaah kar bhi kisi ore tarah ke kapade nahin pahan pate
 To completely eradicate this thinking and fear, the 'john Lewis' brand has completely abolished the process of placing 'girl' and 'boy' tags on clothes
 iske saath hi kai saare faishaq brands aise kapade laane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai jise mahilaayein or purush donon hi pahan sakenge
 Similarly, the US based Wild Fang Company is known for women's tomboy clothes
 'da future is flud' ke naam se inkaa nayaa project aa rahaa he
 In which they have tried to change the thinking of the society about men and women through clothes
 inke collection main looj feeting suut, slogan tii-sharts or is tarah kii jackets taiyaar kii jaaengi jise mahila or purush donon hi pahan sakenge
 CEO of Wild Fang, Emma Makroli, stated that gender neutral clothing will help remove the restrictions on women and men in society
 jiske baad mahila or purush ko samaaj main ek hi najar se dekha jayega
 At the same time some psychologists believe that this thinking is good, but it should be applied only on children's clothing

 According to Gender Therapist Experts, there will definitely be improvement in the society with gender neutral clothing
 lekin saath hi unhone yah bhi bataaya ki mahila or purushon ke saamaanya kapadon ko puri tarah se khatm karnaa bhi galat hoga
 According to them, it is not right to force them to wear clothes of another gender without anyone's wish, unless they want to wear such clothes on their own
 sabhi maa-baap apane bacchon ko khub padhaanaa chaahate hai or kai baar padhai ke peeche bacchon ke saath thodi sakhti bhi baratate hai

 haalanki tariff toilet jane ke bahaane se madrase se bhi faraar ho gaya or bhagkar jangalon kii ore chalaa gaya
 Some people were informed by the police that a child was held in chains
 soochna paakar pahunchi police ne jangalon ke andar se bachche ko khoj nikaala or apane kabje main le liya
 However, this mischievous innocent lied to the police out of fear
 tariff ne police ko bataaya ki vah aligarh kaa rahane vaala he or uskaa apharan kar liya gaya he
 The truth of the child, the police continued to search for Tarif's family in Tappal in Aligarh district
 haalanki bachche ke ravaiye se police ko shaq ho gaya
 When the police strictly asked the innocent Tarif, the child blamed the truth
 bachche se uske mata-pita kaa sahi adress pataa hone ke baad parijanon ne bachche ko uske parijanon ko saunp diya
 However, looking at the police, the cleric of the madrasa said that the child's chain has been opened and the father of the child has also been told that if the child's feet are re-chained, he will not teach the child in the madrasa

 In this regard, seats have been divided among the alliance
 isamen madhya pradesh kii 3 siton par sapa ladegi baaki 26 siton par basapa chunaav ladegi
 Similarly, in 5 seats of Uttarakhand, Pauri will contest SP in Garhwal seat while the remaining 4 seats have gone to bsp's account
 madhya pradesh kii jin 3 siton par sapa ladegi, unamem khajuraho, tikamgarh or balaghat shaamil he
 This information has been given in a joint statement issued by BSP chief Mayawati and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav
 haal hi main madhya pradesh main hue vidhansabha chunaav main sapa-basapa ne congress se alag chunaav ladaa tha
 In this, SP got one seat while BSP got 2 seats
 lekin nattejey ke baad congress kii kamalnath sarkaar ko basapa ne samarthan dene kaa faisla kiya tha
 Before the split of seats in UP, the two parties had decided to fight together in Uttar Pradesh
 is gathbandhan main upi kii 80 siton main se 75 siton par donon dalon ke bich siton kaa bantwaaraa hua he
 The SP will contest in 37 of these seats, while the BSP will field its candidates in 38 seats
 upi kii anya 5 siton main se 2 siten raibareli or amethi hai, jinpar is gathbandhan ne apana ummidavaar nahin utaarne kaa faisla kiya he
 In both these seats, Congress President Rahul Gandhi and his mother Sonia Gandhi are mps
 mana ja rahaa he ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan main upi kii 3 siten ajit singh kii party areldi ke liye rakhi gai hai
 For this, a meeting has also been held between Jayant Chaudhary and Akhilesh Yadav, although the decision is not yet approved
 agar pichley loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon kii baat karen to saal 2014 main donon dalon ko upi se baahar ek bhi seat nahin mili thi
 The SP was successful in winning 5 seats in UP, while the BSP was swept out of the country and did not win a single Lok Sabha seat
 lekin vot share ke maamle main basapa tisare sabase badi party thi

 When asked about the possible misuse of exemption in respect of medical emergency, Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi told the reporters, "I appeal to the people of Delhi to avoid the scheme by lying about the conditions of medical emergency, new Do not start the year

 Bassi, however, said that he had sought some clarification on the exemptions
 unhone saath hi logon se yojana ke daayre main aane se bachane ke liye nakli number platon ke istemaal na karne yaa usase sambandhit vichaaron ko na apnaane kii apil karte hue kaha ki aisa karne se na keval motor vaahan adhinium kaa ulanghan hoga, balki bhartiya dand samhita kii dharaaen bhi lagengi
 The comments dilli police pramukh ne kaha ki trephic karmchaaree vaise hi sadakon par tainaat rahete hai, isliye buudhvaar ko yojana ke purvaabhyas main hissaa lenaa koi samasya nahin hogi

 Especially because the number of exemptions has made the job easier
 bassi ne haalanki kaha ki unhone chhuton ko lekar kuch spashtikaran maange hai
 He also appealed to the people not to use fake number plates to avoid falling within the purview of the scheme or to adopt ideas related to it, saying that doing so would not only violate the Motor Vehicles Act, but the Indian Penal Code There will also be currents of tippaniyan The Delhi Police Chief said that traffic workers are deployed on the same roads, so it will not be a problem to participate in the rehearsal of the scheme on Wednesday
 haalanki unhone kaha ki unhen ab tak purvaabhyas kii soochna nahin he
 Apart from the discounts related to medical emergency, the traffic department has asked the Delhi government to clear the situation with several exemptions
 bassi ne kaha, agar koi mahila jise gaadi chalaanaa nahin aata, kisi chaalak ke saath safar kar rahi ho to ham kya karenge? kya ham chaalak se apni seat chhodane ke liye kahenge, aakhirkaar mahila fansi rah jaaegi? ham sarkaar ke saath yah mudda uthaanaa chahenge or puuchhenge ki kya yojana main koi sanshodhan sambhav he
 He then reiterated that action would be taken against volunteers who took the law into their own hands, forcing motorists to abide by the restrictions

 According to the Islamic calendar, the new year begins with the month of Muharram
 ise saal-e-hizrat (jab mohammad sahab makke se madeene ke liye gaye the) bhi kaha jaataa he
 Muharram is not a festival or a month of happiness, but this month is full of sorrow
 itnaa hi nahin duniya kii tamaam insaaniyat ke liye ye maheenaa ibrat (seekhney) ke liye he
 In the month of Muharram, about 1400 years ago, there was a historical and stirring battle of Islamic date
 is jang kii dastaan sunakar or padhakar ruh kaanp jaati he
 a battle of justice was fought against Baatil, in which ahl-e-bait (nabi's clan) sacrificed his life and saved Islam
 is jang main julm kii intehaa ho gai, jab iraq kii rajdhani baghdad se kareeb 120 kilometre dur karbala main badshaah yajid ke pathar dil farmaanon ne mahaj 6 maheene ke ali asagar ko pani tak nahin pine diya
 Where hunger and thirst made a mother's breast milk dry and when Yajid's army slaughtered Imam Hussain of the Prophet Mohammad while reciting namaz, he was brutally murdered
 is jang main imam hossain ke saath unke 72 saathiyon ko bhi badi beharmi se shahid kar diya gaya
 Their homes were set on fire and the survivors of the family were taken prisoner
 julm kii intehaa tab hui jab imam hossain ke saath unke unke mahaj 6 maheene ke maasoom bete ali asagar, 18 saal ke ali akbar or 7 saal ke unke bhattije kasim (hasan ke bete) ko bhi badi berahami se shahid kiya gaya
 Muharram is celebrated in memory of the sacrifice of Imam Hussain and his 72 companions
 muharram shiya or sunni donon samudaay ke log manaate hai
 However, the way to celebrate it is quite different
 10 muharram roj-e-aashura:-yun to muharram kaa puraa maheenaa hi bahut paak or gam kaa maheenaa hota he, lekin muharram 10waan din jise roj-e-aashura kehete hai
 It is the most important day
 1400 saal pehle muharram ke maheene kii 10 taarikh ko hi imam hossain ko shahid kiya gaya tha
 Tajis are extracted on the 10th of Muharram in the same sorrow
 shiya samudaay ke log matam karte hai
 Majlis reads, wearing black clothes and mourning
 yahaan tak kii shiya samudaay ke log muharram kii 10 taarikh ko bhukhe pyaase rahete hai, kyonki imam hossain or unke kafile ko logon ko bhi bhookha rakhaa gaya tha or bhukh kii haalat main hi unako shahid kiya gaya tha
 Whereas the Sunni community express their grief by offering Roza-namaz

 Ranveer Singh, who rose from the role of Delhi's Tapori boy in 'band Baaja Baaraat' to the overbearing character of 'bajirao Mastani', is seen touching the heights of his strong acting today
 film 'bajirao mastaani' main unki adaayagi ke industry se lekar critics or darshak bhi kaayal ho gaye hai
 The director of this film himself, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, even went on to say about Ranveer that he cannot think without Bajirao Mastani film Ranveer Singh
 shaayad yahaan sanjay lila bhansaali kaa kahana bilkul sahi he kyonki ranvir starer bajirao mastaani ne bollywood ke king khan shahrukh khan kii film dilavaale ko box offis par pachhad diya he

 SUPERB!— taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)december 31, 2015is film ko darshakon kii khub saraahna mili he
 But even before its release, the love triangles featured in Ranveer, Deepika and Priyanka's film may have drawn the audience to themselves
 'bajirao mastaani' or 'dilavaale' ke utsaah ko dekhne ke liye ajtak ke pole main bhi bajirao ne baaji maari
 Ranveer's 'bajirao' surpassing Shah Rukh's 'dilwale', the best movies of Bollywood's big stars have set foot at the box office for the second week
 shahrukh khan kii 'dilavaale' or ranvir singh kii 'bajirao mastaani' kii box offis takkar itani damdaar ho jaaegi ye kisi ne nahin sochaa
 Both films are earning well, but Ranveer's film overtook Shahrukh's film
 'dilavaale' kii box offis par behtareen shuruyaat dekhi gai thi par 'bajirao mastaani' ke aage tik nahin pai
 Amitabh Bachchan's letter is more than box office collection: While 100 crore to 500 crore club stars are discussed in the industry in Bollywood, Ranveer's box office figures do not give special attention
 lekin haa unke liye saraahna jarur myne rakhti he
 Actually, the great Amitabh Bachchan praised Ranveer Singh after seeing 'bajirao Mastani' and sent a hand-written letter to Ranveer Singh, which Ranvir was very happy to get and kept that letter
 ranbir ne is bare main baat karte hue kaha, haa, mujhe mahanayake amitabh bachchan ne note bheja he, unka likhaa hua letters, wo apane aap main ek aword he
 You will not believe that all the trophies i have won are in my drawing room, but instead of keeping the frame of Mr
 Bachchan's note at home, i have sent it to the bank and kept it inside the locker
 ranvir kii adaayagi ke darshak ke alaava kai diggaj bhi kaayal ho gaye hai, isliye agar unke bajirao ke kirdaar ko yah dekhakar kaha jaae ki 'chitah kii chaal, baj kii najar or ranvir ke hunar par andeh nahin karte' to galat nahin
 Let's know what the famous critics of the industry have to say about Ranveer's skills
 'lambi res ke ghode hai ranvir': taran adarsh (film trade enelist)aap dekhen kii 'bajirao mastaani' kaa muqabla ek badi film ke saath hua tha, donon ke bich bijness kaa gap pehle teen din to kaaphi rahaa, lekin baad main yah kaaphi kam hota najar aayaa
 The film has been well accepted, as well as the film's actors and especially Ranveer Singh has been highly appreciated
 unke upar kaaphi daaromadar tha ki unhen khud ko sabit karnaa he or box offis par achche numbers lekar aane hai
 So Ranveer has proved himself as an actor
 film industry main aapako hameshaa aapaki pichhali film ke aadhaar par jaancha jaataa he, or ranvir ne sanjay lila bhansaali ke saath 'goliyon kii raasalila: ramlila' main bhi damdaar parformens di thi or is baar bhi unki film ko naa sirf critics ne saraahaa he balki box offis par bhi isaki raftaar bahut tej he, or ab ranvir singh kii industry main pojishan or bhi majboot ho chuki he, ranvir ab aisa lagata he kii 'lambi res ke ghode hai
 "ranveer Singh is now difficult to stop": Wazir Singh (editor: Box Office India) After 'bajirao Mastani' it is very difficult to stop Ranveer Singh now, he has got a lot of love, most appreciated his acting has gone
 media, critics or darshakon ne unki jamkar tarif kii he kyonki ranvir ne sabko apane acting ke jariye aashcharyachakit kiya he
 The audience is praising Ranveer along with the film, not only in the country but also from abroad
 kamaal kii energy he ranvir main:ranvir kii adaayagi ke alaava unki ek or khaas baat he ve he unka energy level, unhen kai events, shoj yaa phans ke bich kabhi bhi dekhen to vah har vakt masti ke mood main najar aate hai
 Perhaps this one thing related to his personality also sets him apart from many stars
 aap in tasveeron ke jariye is baat kaa andaja laga sakate hai
 Ranveer Singh topped in love body too: Ranveer Singh is very exciting not only in films but also in real life
 haalanki unhone abtak kabhi apane rishte kaa izhaar khul kar nahin kiya lekin deepika padukon sang unke afaire kii charchaa ab aam he
 Even if Ranveer does not express it openly, but his chemistry with Deepika is more than that of a co-star and a friend
 aaie jaanate hai deepika kaa kya kahana he ranvir singh ko lekar:deepika ne kaha, 'ranvir mere best friend hai
 i am very emotional and sensitive and quickly become unhappy due to feeling insecure
 main ranvir ke saamne apane man kii koi bhi baat kah sakati hum
 i don't need to hide anything from him
 vah mujhe kabhi takalif nahin pahunchaa saktaa
 Our relationship is of trust and understanding
 main unhen pyaar or unki izzat isliye karti hum kyonki hamaare bich ek kamaal kaa conection he

 sargical strike kaa video saamne aane par kendriya grih rajyamantri kiran rigiju ne kaha ki bade afsos kii baat he ki congress party jinhone 50 saalon tak is desh par shashan kiya
 She is speaking such a language today
 bharat ke tukade karne vaale jo gang hai vahi bhashaa congress bol rahi he
 Do people of any country ever ask for evidence from their army? When the surgical strike took place, Congress said that proof is needed
 congress ke saath arvind kejariwal ne bhi saboot maanga
 When the evidence comes to the fore, it is said that publicity is happening
 aakhir chaahate kya hai? bahut hi afsos kii baat he ki congress party ne itane saalon tak hindustan par raaj kiya or aaj hindustan ke khilaaf pakistan kii bhashaa bol rahi he
 Sadly for any country
 sargical strike kaa raajnneetik phayda vaale randeep surajevaala ke bayaan par kiran rigiju ne kaha, 'yahi to baat main kahana chaah rahaa hum ki jab 50 saalon se unhone zyada shashan kiya to unako maaloom he ki system kya he

 He said, 'all work is done in coordination
 jab army ne desh hit main koi ection kiya he

 usamen sarkaar kii jaankaree main hi sab kuch hota he
 That is when Congress asked for evidence from the Army
 us samay hi hamane yah kah diya tha desh hit main is mudde par raajnneeti nahin kerani chahie
 So repeatedly asking for evidence and then on getting the evidence, it is said that publicity is happening
 congress ko hi bataanaa chahie ki aakhir vah chaahati kya he
 i still do not understand
 congress party ko santulit hona chahie
 Their language should be a balance in their deeds
 kitna desh hit main hota he kitna desh virodh main hota he
 They should be explained
 'sijafire waileshan par kiran rigiju ne kaha ki yah bayaanbaji kii baat nahin he
 These issues should not be rhetorical
 ye log kabhi army chif ko sadak ke gunde bolte hai to kabhi army se saboot maangate hai
 Sometimes speak the language of Pakistan
 unhone kaha, 'hamaari taraf se ye raajnneeti karne kaa koi vishay hi nahin he
 Whether it is in Kashmir or anywhere, there are actions which take place at the top of the country
 us sab par raajnneeti karne kii vajah se congress ko itani kam seat mili hai
 In view of corruption and failures of the Congress, people have rejected
 border par pakistan ko javaabi karrwai par kiran rigiju ne kaha, 'jo bhi karrwai hoti he wo bataakar nahin kii jaati he
 In Jammu and Kashmir, we have successfully government

 chhattisgarh sarkaar ne apane ek faisle se peeche hatakar rajya main rajnatik bavaal ko ranneetik taur par taal diya he
 The BJP government of the state had made political, administrative, social and diplomatic preparations to implement the new provisions of the SC / ST Act
 iske liye rajya ke kanoon vibhaag ne bhi supreme court ke nae nirdeshon ko lagu karaane ke liye prashasnic pahal shuru kar di thi
 An important decision in this case was to be taken on Tuesday
 isamen yah tay hona tha ki supreme court ke nae praavdhaanon ko jas kaa tas lagu kiya jaae
 a special meeting was also held for this
 is baithak main pradesh kii taaja rajnatik sthiti or SC / ST praavdhaanon ke lagu kiye jane par donon hi samudaay main jane vaale sandeshon ko gambhirtha se vichaar kiya gaya
 After this, the Chhattisgarh government took a U-turn on the issue of implementing the new amendment of the Supreme Court in the SC / ST Act
 sanshodhan nirast karne kii guhaar lagaaegi rajya sarkarsarkaar is act kii vaapasi ko lekar ab supreme court main yachika daayar kar ise nirast karne kii guhaar lagaaegi
 Earlier, on 20 March, the government decided to implement the amended provisions of the Supreme Court
 ise mangalvaar ko amalijama pahanaaya janaa tha, lekin SC / ST sanghathanon or apane virdohi dalon ke mukhar hone ke baad raman singh sarkaar ko you turn lene par majaboor hona padaa
 The Chhattisgarh government's u turn on the matter, the entire Chhattisgarh ministry was on a high on Tuesday
 mantriyon se lekar afasar tak file lekar mukhyamantri se milte rahe or unke samaksh apana feed back dete rahe
 While citing the Supreme Court's new guide lines and provisions, someone kept informing the Chief Minister about the political equations being created in the state, while someone kept commenting about the ruckus created in the state by the implementation of this decision
 mantriyon or afasaron ke saath baithak karne ke baad mukhyamantri raman singh ne pradesh ke taaja rajnatik halaat par lambii mantranaa kii
 He then took a sudden U-turn
 nae praavdhaan lagu nahin karegi rajya sarkarsarkaar ne elaan kiya ki ab voweshchh / ST act ke nae praavdhanonko lagu hi nahin karegi balki use nirast karne ke liye supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataayegi
 According to Chief Minister Raman Singh, his government in this matter will put its side firmly in the Supreme Court
 iske baad hi koi faisla liya jayega
 According to him, a large section of tribals and scheduled castes reside in Chhattisgarh
 unke upar is faisle kaa sidhaa asar padegaa
 So they will put the whole matter before the Supreme Court
 congress ke armaanon par phiraa panimukhyamantri raman singh ke is elaan ke baad congress sakate main aa gai he
 He hoped that with the implementation of this decision, a big issue would come in his hands
 isse wo pradesh bhar main abhiyaan chalaa kar bijepi ko aade haathon legi, lekin sarkaar ke you turn ne congress ke armaanon par pani pher diya he
 However, the Congress claims that the BJP government had to reverse its decision due to its opposition
 pradesh congress pravaktaa shailesh nitin trivedi ne sarkaar ke you turn par pratikriya jaahir karte hue kaha ki congress ke virodh ke chalate hi bijepi sarkaar ko apana faisla palatnaa padaa
 He called BJP an enemy of SC and ST class
 chhattisgarh main isi saal hone hai vidhansabha chunaavchhattisgarhmen isi saal oktober yaa november maah main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Due to this, not only Congress but other social and political parties are also eyeing every decision of the government
 wo mukhyamantri raman singh ke kisi bhi faisle ko janata kii adaalat main le janaa chaahate hai taaki us faisle ke rajnatik myne bhi nikaale ja saken
 The same happened in this case, as the Supreme Court itself directed the government to implement the new provisions of the Supreme Court
 lihaaja bagaiyr kisi rajnatik munaafe yaa nuksaan ke ise lagu karne kii javabdehi rajya sarkaar par thi
 The Chief Minister also took a dig at Congress and started creating an atmosphere for this and also the process of implementation, but the new provisions of this Act raised the ears of the Government of Chhattisgarh from all over the country
 isse pehle ki wo ise lagu karti isse paidaa hone vaale nae rajnatik samikarnon kii aahat se rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ko apana faisla waapas lenaa padaa
 On the other hand, Chief Minister Raman Singh lashed out at the Congress and said that it is trying to mislead the people by looking at all administrative decisions from the political prism
 unhone kaha ki congress ke dushprachaar se ab bhi kuch nahin hone vaala
 He claimed that this time too BJP will be in power
 Elections: amit shah (amit Shah) par hue hamale or unki road sho main hui hinsa ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bengal ke siem mamata banerjee par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 He was addressing an election rally in the harbor of West Bengal
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke road sho main hui hinsa ko lekar piem modi ne apni sabha main kaha ki kal kolkata kii tasviren puure desh ne dekhi hai
 Didi's administration and hooliganism tried their best to influence the bjp's roadshow, but the people of Kolkata thwarted all their efforts
 iske liye main kolkata ke sabhi nagarikon kaa aabhaar vyakt karata hum
 PM Modi said that this time the whole country has seen how TMC has kept the Republic as a hooliganism
 yahaan par bhartiya janata party ko apni baat rakhane se roka ja rahaa he
 Candidates are being prevented from contesting elections, from putting their point before the public
 piem modi ne kaha ki didi kaa ye gundatantr ab nahin chalegaa
 Today, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is turning the opposite of what Bengal had imagined
 gurudev dar se rahit, oonche mastak vaala bengal chaahate the
 In Didi's rule, bullets are being shot on the forehead of Bangla youth
 piem modi ne kaha ki dar kaa alam to ye he ki jai maa kaali, jai maa durga, jai maa saraswati or jai shriram tak kahana mushkil ho gaya he
 If a youth jokes, even political satire, he is put in jail
 yahaan kii beuroperesi, yahaan kii police par kitna pressure he, iskaa udhaaharan ek purv IPS kii khudakushi he
 PM Modi said that the person who spent his whole life in the safety of the life of the common man of West Bengal, was forced to commit suicide
 jahaan police prashasan hi itane khauf main ji rahaa he, aise dinon kii kalpana to gurudev ne nahin kii thi
 PM Modi said that in a state where only an IPS officer will not get justice, it is not difficult to guess how the common man would be living in fear
 buaa-bhattije ke model of gavarnence main dar or bhay se mukti kii bahut badi bhoomika he
 This is the generosity of the sister, thankfully, completely free from fear and fear - the intruder
 dar or bhay se puri tarah mukt hai- go-taskar, maanav taskar, betiyon ke taskar
 Completely free from fear and dread - Didi's Tolabaz and Didi's Syndicate
 dar or bhay se puri tarah mukt hai- garibon ko luutane vaale chitfund vaale netaa
 Completely free from fear and fear - coal mafia, sand mafia
 piem modi ne kaha ki teachers ko, government imployies ko selary or inkrement bhale hi naa mili, lekin tiemasi ke bhaade ke gundon ko samay par pement hoti he
 There is hooliganism on the ration of the poor, on the poor's house, even on the wages of MNREGA
 jahaan ek daftar tak koi bina tolabaji ke nahin khol saktaa, vahaan factriyaan or udyog kaise aaenge, ye aap soch sakate hai
 The old factories, jute mills are also being used to stop this intruder gang
 jo swaarth or lut-khasot ko hi bharat kii raajnneeti kaa charitra maan baithe hai unheen ko bhaajapa se pareshaani ho rahi he
 These are the people who suffer from Vande Mataram today
 piem modi ne kaha ki ye wo log hai jinako sargical strike or air strike se samasya hoti he
 These are the people who trust the lies of Pakistan more than the truth of India
 ye wo log hai, jinako bharat kii har siddhi, har prasiddhi se takalif hoti he
 The youth of West Bengal have started to challenge this oppression of Didi
 apane bhaashan main piem modi ne kaha ki buaa-bhattije ke gang ne jis tarah se pashchim bengal ko badnaam kiya he, uske khilaaf aaj vidroh ho rahaa he
 Sister has come down on threats in a fit of rage
 inch-inch badla lene kii baat karti hai
 He said that you played a big game of revenge in the road show yesterday, inch by inch, but it is the people of Bengal who kept on throwing stones on the chest but did not let Amit Shah do anything
 ye bengal kii janata he jinhone tumhaare gunde jo aag ke gole phenk rahe the, ek bhi gola apane adhyaksh tak pahunchane nahin diya, ye takat bengal kii betiyon ne, bengal ke naujavaanon ne dikhaai he
 He said that this is a phase of change in Bengal, not revenge
 or yakeen maniye, is baar didi ke bhattije kaa dibba gol he
 The nephew's office is certain to be locked after the election results are out
 piem modi ne kaha ki vaise mujhe bataaya gaya he ki bhattije kaa offis bhi, tiemasi kii parampara par chalate hue, road par kabja karke banaaya gaya he
 There were evils in Didi, but they have doubled them by taking evils from the left
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki 23 may ko jab phir ek baar
 
 
 Modi government
 
 
 aegi, tab ek mahatvapurn kaam ham karne vaale hai
 Intruders will be identified
 unka puraa biodeta khangala jayega
 The border will be further protected by modern fencing
 yahi nahin, aasthaa ke kaaran sataae hue jo saathi yahaan sharnaarthiyon kaa jivan ji rahe hai, unako chintaa karne kii zarurat nahin he
 We are about to amend the citizenship law
 taaki maa bharti kii har us santan ko naagarikta mil sake jiske paas bharat ke alaava koi thikaana nahin he
 At the election rally, PM Modi said that Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas is our mantra, and safety for all, respect for all is our vow
 hamane tay kiya he ki 2022 tak har garib ke paas pakkaa ghar ho
 By 2022 every family should have electricity, gas stove in the house
 2022 tak kisaan kii aay doguni ho
 It is our resolve that those who are young companions get opportunities
 piem modi ne kaha ki diamond harbar sahit puure pashchim bengal main infrastracchar viksit karne par hamaara jor he
 Rather, we are promoting port-led development
 ham 21veen sadi ke nae bharat ke sankalp ko lekar eemaandaaree se kaam kar rahe hai isliye puraa desh ham par vishwaas kar rahaa he

 jis vakt yah blog likh rahaa hum, usee vakt ek messej pop ap ho rahaa he ki kal vishwa jansankhya diwas he
 When did the world population cross 7 billion
 kya ham zarurat se zyada ho gaye hai? ab badhati aabaadi par koi baat nahin karata
 Banning the growing population is not an issue in politics
 isamen dharm kaa kone bhi aa jaataa he
 But, if we want lakhs to keep talking about this issue and keep telling their population their resources, but if we look at some studies, then there will be signs of crisis in the context of rivers and water
 haal hi main, niti ayog ne sanyukt jal prabandhan suchakank (composit water management index, seedbluemhai) viksit kiya he taaki desh main jal prabandhan ko prabhavi banaaya ja sake
 The caveat is clear, by the year 2030 the demand for water in the country is going to be double the available supply
 is paridrishy main, har rajya kii jansankhya vruddhi ko dekha jaae, jiskaa purvanumaan bhartiya rashtriya jansankhya ayog 2001-2026 ne 2006 main kiya tha
 It is now forecast for 2080
 iske mutabik, ganga basin main aabaadi saal 2040 tak kariban dedh guni ho jaaegi
 According to the 2011 census, the population of this basin is 45
 5 karod thi jo 2040 main badhkar 70
 6 crores
 badhati aabaadi ke saath shaharikaran bhi badhegaa
 There will be a 70 percent increase in the urban population
 shahari aabaadi maujuuda 14
 4 crores to 24
 3 karod tak ho jaaegi
 There will be a 35% increase in rural population
 yah maujuuda (2011) ke 34
 46 from 1 crore read
 3 karod ho jaaegi
 Obviously, this growing population will need food to eat, water for bathing and washing
 anaaj ugane ke liye pani bhi maujuuda sansadhano se hi khinchaa jayega
 In fact, the demand for water increases with the increase in population and consumer demand and the growth of the world market
 water risource group kaa purvanumaan kahata he ki saal 2030 tak sinchai ke liye pani kii jarurat salanaa 2
 Will grow at the rate of 4 percent
 yani 2040 tak kii gananaa kii jaae, to pani kii maang aaj kii tulana main 80 fisadi bad jaaegi
 The same research paper said that the demand for water for the needs of products in the industrial sector will quadruple
 vishay aisa he ki hamen or aapako chintaa karne kii jarurat he
 We have only 4% of the world's fresh water
 aabaadi ko boj usase kai guna zyada
 As Gandhiji used to say, nature has a lot to fulfill our needs, but our greed is not worth fulfilling
 hamen do morchon par kaam karne kii jarurat he
 On one side, the rivers have to be saved, on the other side the population will have to be effectively controlled
 varanaa, teesraa vishwayuddh pani ke liye ho na ho, grihayuddh jarur ho jayega

 ’sahvaag ne kaha, ‘maine do ghante main sirf 20 ran banaaye
 Can you imagine Sehwag scoring 20 runs in two hours? i don't play like this but i changed my game just to save a Test match
 ’ sahvaag ne ‘apper cat’ kaa zikr un shaat main se ek ke rup main kiya jisane unka khel badla

 He said, 'some things come naturally in your game and the upper cut is one of them
 maine kabhi net main is shaat kaa abhyaas nahin kiya
