 The landmark judgment of the apex court has come on the long-running war between Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party government and the Deputy Governor
 is faisle ko aam aadmi party apni badi jeet maan rahi he
 Shortly after the Supreme Court's decision, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called it a major victory for the people and democracy
 kejariwal ne twit kiya, 'dilli kii janata kii badi jeet
 
 
 
 
 Great victory of democracy
 ' iske alaava dilli ke up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne kaha ki jis tarah dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar ke kaam par adnga lagaaya ja rahaa tha, wo khatm ho gaya he
 We thank the Supreme Court on behalf of the people of Delhi for this
 unhone kaha ki ab dilli sarkaar ko apni filein up rajyapal ke paas bhejne kii jarurat nahin hoga
 The Lt
 Governor has to accept the decision of the cabinet
 transfar or posting sarkaar hi karegi
 a big victory for the people of Delhi
 
 
 a big victory for democracy
 
 
 - Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) July 4, 2018 He said that due to the obstruction of the Governor, the work of the public was hanging
 ab up rajyapal kii manamaani kii sambhaavna khatm ho gai he or dilli sarkaar sahi tareeke se apane kaam kar paaegi
 He said that while delivering the verdict in the case earlier, the Supreme Court said that the Lieutenant Governor is not free to take a decision in Delhi
 alji ko cabinet kii salaah ke anusaar hi kaam karnaa hoga
 Meanwhile, he also said that the movement on the status of full state will continue
 iske alaavasupreme courtne saaf kar diya he ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja milanaa mumkin nahin he
 It is clear from the decision of the Supreme Court that the elected government of Delhi is responsible for running the state
 faisle ke baad mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne bhi twit kar khushi jataa di he, unhone kaha he ki dilli main loktantr kii jeet hui he
 Supreme Court lawyer and Aam Aadmi Party leader Somnath Bharti said in the case, 'it has become clear from the decision of the Supreme Court that the constitutional rights have been given to the Delhi government only
 inhen adhikaron ko ristor kiya gaya he
 The constitution says that the Delhi government will take decisions on all matters except police, land and law and order
 abhi tak jin kaamon par adngebaaji hoti thi, un par ab roak lag gai he
 'sheila Dixit said - By joining together, Congress leader and former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit said,' Whether the work comes under the control of the Lieutenant Governor or under the control of the Chief Minister
 lekin milakar kaam karnaa hoga
 Otherwise, work cannot be done in case of differences
 supreme court ne samvidhan main die gaye praavdhaanon ko hi doharaaya he
 The posts of Deputy Governor and Chief Minister are of responsibility
 jab dilli main hamaari sarkaar thi, tab bhi matbhed hote the, lekin ham milakar sulajhaa lete the
 Sometimes the lieutenant governor bowed down and sometimes we bowed down
 'BJP ne bataaya- kejariwal ko jhatkis faisle ko bijepi ne kejariwal sarkaar ke liye jhatka bataaya he
 BJP leader Vijender Gupta in the case says that the Supreme Court has approved the High Court's decision
 isse ek baar phir saaf ho gaya he ki police, jameen or kanoon vyavastha ke maamle par up rajyapal kaa puraa niyantran hai
 In response to a question, he said that the Lieutenant Governor does not himself order
 wo dilli sarkaar ke faisle par hi muhar lagaate hai
 It has been said in this decision that only the Lieutenant Governor will approve the decision of the Delhi Government
 is faisle ko apni jeet bataakar aam aadmi party logon ko gumraah kar rahi he
 Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik suspended Rajya Sabha member Pyari Mohan Mohapatra and four others including two ministers from the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) on Friday for their involvement in anti-party activities

 Patnaik made the announcement at the state secretariat after several hours of discussion with senior party leaders and legislators at his government residence
 patnayak ne kaha ki do mantriyon ko sarkaar se baahar karne ke liye unhone rajyapal emasi bhandare ko patr likhaa he

 Keep in mind that the BJP had promised in its election manifesto that it would complete this task
 ab smriti irani is vaade ko puraa karnaa chaahati hai
 She met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to demand allocation of funds for projects such as not only iits but also a Central University for Himalayan technology and an e-library
 smriti ke is prayaas se kerala, jharkhand, uttarakhand, goa, sikkim or chhattisgarh ko bada laabh hoga
 These states do not have iits

 During the election season in Uttar Pradesh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to Lucknow and raised slogans of Jai Shri Ram from Ramlila Maidan, then his minister reached Ayodhya and started pressing the feet of saints and Mahants
 samskruti or paryaton mantri mahesh sharma mangalvaar ko ek din ke daure par ayodhya pahunche or ramayana sangrahalaya samet kai choti-moti yojanaon kii ghoshnaa kar daali
 First he went to meet Mahant Nritya Gopaldas, president of Ram Janma Bhoomi Nyas and put his feet there and pressed his feet
 jab unase poocha gaya ki ramayana sangrahalay banane kii yaad unako tabhi kyon ai jab chunaav sir par he , to mahesh sharma kaa jawaab tha ki yah sawaal akhilesh yadav se poocha janaa chahie jinhone apane kaarykaal puraa hone ke thik pehle ram ke naam par theme park banane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Mahesh Sharma announced that a grand Ramayana museum will be built in Ayodhya under the Ramayana circuit, but the land is not yet known for him
 aaj ayodhya pahunchane par khud wo do jagahon par jaakar ramayana sangrahalay kii jameen dekhne gaye
 The first land that Union Tourism Minister Mahesh Sharma has seen for the Ram Digital Museum is 30 acres of land behind the Ram Katha Museum on the right side of the Chaudhary Charan Singh Ghat on the Saryu Bridge, which belongs to the tourism department
 duusari bhoomi sarayu pal se 3 kilometre dur ramlila sankul kii bhoomi he jo 24 acre he
 It is the land of the Sanskrit department
 donon bhoomi khaali padi he
 Mahesh Sharma said that he will form a technical committee which will come to Ayodhya and decide in which land it would be okay to have a digital museum
 khaas baat yah he ki somvaar ko hi akhilesh yadav kii sarkaar ne yah elaan kiya ki vah ayodhya main ek antarrashtriya theme park banaaenge jo ram kaa jivan chitra dikhayega
 The Ramlila complex is also the place where the state government wants to build a theme park
 yani rajya sarkaar or centre sarkaar donon ne ayodhya ko lekar jo ghoshnaaen kii he vah abhi hawa hawaii he or kab tak jameen par utrengi kaha nahin ja saktaa
 On the other hand, BJP leader Vinay Katiyar gave a new twist to the case by saying that building Ramayana museum is such a thing as lollipop and in fact the government should work to build Ram temple
 mahesh sharma kii maujuudagi main manch se hi nrity gopal das ne kaha ki modi ko apane isi kaarykaal main hi ram mandir kaa nirmaan kaam shuru kar dena chahie
 When Mahesh Sharma was asked about Vinay Katiyar's statement in Ayodhya, he cut off the kanni without giving any answer

 - Vijay Sampla (@vijaysamplabjp) April 23, 2019 Let us know that there is a wave of happiness among Akali Dal leaders after the announcement of film actor Sunny Deol joining BJP and contesting Lok Sabha elections from Gurdaspur in Punjab

 At the same time, the Akali Dal also believes that Sunny Deol will leave his influence in the 10 Lok Sabha seats of Punjab coming to his account
 in 10 main se 3 siten aisi hai jahaan se sani deol ke paariwarik sambandh hai
 With this, the Akali Dal leaders are assuming that they will get the benefit
 ludhiana ke saahanewaal main deol parivaar kaa paitruk ghar he
 Sahnewal area is also close to Fatehgarh Sahib Lok Sabha constituency
 fatehgarh sahib loksabhaa seat akali dal ke khate main he
 Apart from this, the Akali Dal candidate is also in the fray from Sangrur Lok Sabha seat in Punjab, where Banbhora Sunny Deol's Nanaka (mother's mother) family belongs
 aise main akali dal ko ummid he ki sani deol naa sirf bijepi ke khate kii 3 loksabhaa siten balki unke khate main aane vaali sangrur, ludhiana or fatehgarh sahib loksabhaa siton par bhi apana prabhaav chodenge

 ise psycometric test bhi kehete hai
 It can be both physical and mental
 apti paas karne ke liye 10 tips:1
 Solve old question paper: If you are preparing for aptitude test, then solve old question paper of previous year
 isse naa sirf aapaki practice hogi balki speed bhi badhegi
 Keep in mind the time limit while practicing
 2
 Time Management: Start practicing mock test paper a few days after practicing with old question papers
 isse aap apane time management skill ko delvap kar sakenge
 3
 pehle paanch sawaalon par focus karen:agar aap computerised aptitude test de rahe hai to sabase pehle shuru ke paanch queshchan ko dhyaan se solve karen
 This is because it happens many times that the first five questions in a computerized test are quite tuff
 agar aapane in pancho queshchan ke sahi jawaab de die to aapke overol score main badhat ho sakati he
 4
 jawaab dene ke pehle sawaal ko achche se padhein:akasar aisa dekha gaya he ki aptitude test main vards or frejes tivest kar die jate hai
 In this case, do not hurry to mark the answer
 sawaal ko achche se padhein tabhi jawaab den
 5
 agar kisi ansar main shaq ho to dabl check karen:agar kisi queshchan main kanfusion ho to final ansar mark karne se pehle kam se kam do baar jarur check kar len
 6
 sabhi sawaalon ke jawaab den:agar aap saare aptitude queshchan solve nahin karte hai to sahi jawaab dene ke baavjood aapke overol score par bura asar pad saktaa he
 In such a situation, definitely answer all questions
 7
 Avoid negative marking: Two cases have been seen in the aptitude test
 pehla blank ansar dene par negative marks or doosraa galat ansar dene par negative marks
 In this case, read the question paper carefully and avoid negative marking
 8
 Do not solve questionnaire in a sequence: Avoid solvents in question paper
 halke sawaalon ko pehle solve karen, isse na sirf aapkaa time bachegaa balki confidence bhi badhegaa
 9
 exam se pehle khud kaa dhyaan rakhen:exam main acchhee parformens dene ke liye yah bahut jaruri he ki aap apane swasthya ko halke main na len
 Sleep 8 hours a day before the exam and eat healthy food
 10
 Gather details: Before clearing any test, be aware of every small and big information related to that exam

 The Government of India is unable to raise funds for the construction of several railway lines that are very important and prioritized strategically close to the China border
 is project ko do saal pehle hi cabinet ne manjuuri di thi, lekin kareeb 2
 Looking at the need of a huge fund of Rs 1 lakh crore, it is difficult to get started at the moment
 indian express kii khabar ke anusaar, suraksha maamalon kii mantrimandaleey samiti (CCS) ne disambar 2015 main is project ke tahat chaar praathamikta vaale railway line ke nirmaan ko manjuuri di thi
 For this, Final Location Survey (FLS) is currently being done by the Railways
 inamen 378 kimi lanbaa missamaari-tenga-tawang line, 498 kimi lanbaa bilaspur-manali-leh line, 227 kimi lanbaa pasighat-teju-roopai line or 249 kimi uttar lakhimpur-bame-silapathar rail line shaamil hai
 In fact, in January 2010, the Defense Ministry had given 'in-principle approval' for the construction of a total of 28 railroads in the border areas
 inamen se 14 railmargon ko samrik railmarg or phir unamem se chaar ko 'praathmik' railmarg nirdhaarit kiya tha
 Preliminary survey has been done for 14 railroads, but no further work has been done on these national projects
 cabinet sachiv kii adhyakshata main border infrastracchar kii empoward kamity (ECBI) main is par kai baar charchaa hui, lekin is maamle main abhi kuch thos nahin ho paaya he
 The Ministry of Defense has also raised this issue in the Central Permanent Coordination Framework (CPCF)
 is samiti main rail mantralay ke pratinidhi bhi hote hai
 According to preliminary estimates, around 2 on the construction of four rail lines strategically important
 1 lakh karod rupee kaa kharch aayega
 a steering committee has been set up under the leadership of the Secretary of Expenditure in the Ministry of Finance to determine where this cost should be arranged
 inke nirmaan main ho rahi deree kii vajah se yah bhi ashanka he laagat or bad jaaegi
 Right now the fund got 345 crores for the survey only
 Government sources say that the railways have refused to set up their own funds for these lines, because these passengers or freight is not a profitable deal in any way
 sisies dwaara inke nirmaan ko praathamikta main rakhane ke badaraksha mantralayane chaaron line ke effeles yani survey ke liye saal 2016-17 main 344
 84 crore budget was approved
 china ko pachhad degi yah rail linesal main ye sabhi line himalay parvat par kaaphi oonchai or durgam ilaake main banane vaali hai
 Therefore, to make them very extensive study, survey needs to be done and the cost on them will also be very high
 bilaspur-manali-leh coridor banane ke baad duniya kaa sabase ooncha railmarg ho jayega or yah china ke quinghai-tibet rail maarg ko peeche chhod degaa

 a copy of the local administration's investigation report on the lathicharge at Banaras Hindu University is still available
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke aadesh par kamishnar dwaara kii gai jaanch main sidhe-sidhe kulapati or proctoral board ko doshi tehraaya gaya he
 This report not only removes the lies of the BHU administration, but it also proves that the administration deliberately tried to cover up the case
 jila prashasan kii jaanch report main vishvavidhyalay prashasan kii ghor laaparvaahee pai gai he
 Changes not tried by the Vice Chancellor The biggest drawback in the report has been found in the College Proctorial Board and Vice Chancellor
 report ke mutabik kulapati yaa proctorial board dwaara chaatro se samvaad karne kii koi bhi koshish nahin kii gai
 Not only this, they also failed to assess the anger of the students
 surakshakarmiyon kii samvedanheenata ujagar21 taarikh ko ghatana ke baad chhedhkhani kii shikaayat par surakshakarmiyon ne koi karrwai nahin kii or iske ulat unhone chaatraon par anuchit tippanee kii
 That is, the charge of the girl students is correct that the security personnel told the victim why she left after 6 pm
 yahaan aapako bataa den ki chif procter lagaataar yah kehete rahe kisurakshakarmiyon nekoi bhi tippanee peedita par nahin kii thi
 Contrary to all the claims of governance in security, proper security arrangements were not made even when the students took to the streets on 22nd and sat on the display
 samvaad ke sabhi daravaaje prashasan ne kiye bandareport main kaha gaya ki prashasan ke paas 36 se 48 ghanton ke bich chaatraon se samvaad karne ke kai maukey the, par un kii taraf se isaki koi pahal nahin hui
 Students gathered but the BHU administration did not make any attempt to reduce the crowd
 vahiin alag-alag chaatr sangh ke netaa bhi is andolan main judate chale gaye
 The matter was further aggravated by the vice-chancellor not meeting with the students, on September 22, the students were waiting for the vice-chancellor at the main gate of the university, but it was a huge mistake for the vice-chancellor to go there with the excuse of security
 agar unako suraksha ke intjaam kam lag rahe the, to vah prashasan se adhik suraksha kii apil kar sakate the
 In his report, the Commissioner accused the police administration of being too strict, saying that the police used excessive force and that the lathi charge on the journalists was unnecessary and could be avoided
 haalanki report main kaha gaya he ki is maamle kii bhi puri jaanch ho rahi he kipulice dwaranunatam prayog bal kaa istemaal kiya gaya he ki nahin
 Those who are ahead in every field are very strong especially in current affairs
 agar aap bhi aise bananaa chaahate hai to apni general nolej is quij ke jariye badhayen

 While the identity politics is dominated before the Assembly elections in Karnataka, the investigation of Aaj Tak's Special Investigative Team has revealed that many organizations in the state act like gangsters who collect money in the name of 'kannada Asmita'
 are doing
 ‘karnataka rakshana vedike’ ke gut jinhen kannada pahchaan ke sabase mukhar jhandabardaaron main mana jaataa he, chunaav se pehle hindi par sthaneey bhashaa kii pramukhataa se judi maangon ko uthaane main sabase aage hai
 In December, several groups gathered under the banner of 'karnataka Rakshana Vedike Yuva Sene' had vehemently opposed the proposed show of actress Sunny Leone in Bangalore on New Year
 in samoohon ne is tarah ke kaarykram ko kannada samskruti par hamalaa qaraar diya tha
 In Aaj Tak's investigation, key officials of important groups of Karnataka Rakshana Vedike (KRV) have been caught on camera saying that they will give a green signal to Sunny Leone's future programs in the Karnataka capital after getting a bribe
 kearvi ke in guton kii kaman narayan gauda or praveen shetty ke haathon main he
 Aajtak's under cover reporter Narayan Gowda's vice president of the KRV faction, Anjanappa, boasted over his group's muscle power when he gave Sunny Leone's fictitious identity as a publicist

 Anjanappa boasted, "those who protested too are all our boys

 wo isliye aae the kyonki maine unhen aadesh diya tha
 We have a large network in the state
 ham ek bayaan se puraa karnataka band kar dene main sakasham rahete hai
 Confident of giving protection to the program, Anjanappa also demanded a hefty amount of money in the form of 'protection Money' to give Sunny's green signal if he wants to have a future event in Bengaluru
 anjanappa ne saath hi guarantee dete hue kaha, ‘main khud vahaan maujuud rahoonga
 Our group leaders will be there to give protection
 har netaa ke saath 10-15 logon kii team rahengi
 'when the reporter covered Anjanappa about the faction fees for this work, he got the answer,' he said
 ek kaam karo, 30 lakh rupye advance de do or 10 lakh rupye baad main (sho ke baad)
 Asked Anjanappa if he had taken the trust of his faction chief Narayan Gowda, he said, "I came here only after talking to him (gowda)
" 30 lakh rupye unhen dijie
 
 
 In advance to my boss
 ’ajtak ne apni jaanch ke daayre main praveen shetty kii aguai vaale kearvi gut ko bhi liya
 r Punith, the vice-president of the faction, demanded Rs 30 lakh to allow Sunny Leone's program in Bengaluru
 punith ne under cover reporter se kaha, ‘aap event kiijie, ham puraa samarthan denge
 At least 300 of our men will be present to provide security on the day of the event
 ’punith ne kaha, ‘jitne aadmi chahen utane aap le sakate hai, 100, 200
 They will be present to provide security
 police baiyrkeding bhi lee ja sakati he
 If any outsiders, protestors or media comes there, our men will take the responsibility of handling them
 hamaare aadmi aapaki madad ke liye event ke khatm hone tak vahaan maujuud rahenge
 'puneeth demanded to give half of the total protection money in advance
 usne baaki rakam sho khatm hone ke baad die jane kii baat kahi
 Puneeth said, 'you give me 15-20 lakh rupees in advance
 baaki sho ke baad
 'puneeth, the leader of the KRV faction led by Praveen Shetty, did not stop here
 usne vailentaines de par sani leone ke program ke liye do acre jagah uplabdh karaane kii peshkash bhi kar daali
 Puneeth said, "such events are very successful in electronics
 jagah meri rahegi
 'under cover reporter said,' So on February 14, decide on Sunny Leone's program on Valentine's Day
 ’punith ne kaha, ‘aap kariye, munaafe main mujhe hissaa dijie

 2005 main devgauda ne siddharamaiya ko je dies se nikaal diya tha is aarope ke saath ki wo party ke netaaon ko congress main le jane ke liye vargla rahe hai
 Siddaramaiah, twice deputy chief minister of the state, was included in the party in the presence of Sonia Gandhi by the Congress
 2006 main jab devgauda, kumaraswami ne dharm singh kii sarkaar giraakar bijepi ke saath saajha sarkaar banaai or dev gauda ne iskaa virodh kiya to siddramaiya ne devegoda par hi sawaal uthaae ye kehete hue kii agar devgauda is maamle ko itnaa gambhirtha se le rahe hai to unhen apane bete ko turant nikaal dena chahietippaniyan Now that the elections are around 3 months away, in such a situation, political statements are being made against the statement made against Deve Gowda Siddaramaiah

 Breaking the barriers and touching new heights is in Ashok Mittal's blood and he inherited this quality from his father
 ve muskaraakar kehete hai, ''hamaara parivaar kabhi bhi prayog karne or nae raaston par chalane kaa jokhim uthaane se nahin bachataa tha
 '' Baldev Raj received Rs 500 from a friend in 1961

 hamaare utpaadon ke khaas swaad, shreshthata or gunvattta ne pehle hi din se lavali sweets ko lokapriy bana diya
 By 1969 we had three shops in the city
 '' haalanki yahaan tak pahunchnaa bhi aasaan nahin tha
 Ashoka recalls those days, saying, "my father always used to say that success never comes in a day
" kisi vyakti ko ek oonche mukaam tak pahunchane ke liye bina ruke or bina thake lagaataar mehnat kerani hoti he
 Even if there was a problem, the father used to go to the bottom of it and make a strategy to overcome it

 Bajaj was not ready to give the dealership to the Mittal family under any circumstances
 ashok kehete hai, ''main unki uljhan samaj saktaa tha
 He could never even imagine in a dream that a family running a sweets shop would be so capable as to think about getting into the automobile business
 ''mittal bataate hai, ''bajaj vaale jab jalandhar aae or hamase baat kii, tab unhen hamaari kaarobaari kshamta kaa pataa chalaa or aakhirkaar unhone hamen dilarship dene kaa faisla kiya
 "it was a huge success for him
" mittal bataate hai, ''is safalataa se hamaara aatmavishvaas bahut majboot ho gaya
 We felt that if we try diligently, every dream can be fulfilled
 ''iske baad parivaar ko 1996 main maaruti car kii dilarship mil gai, jisane punjab main chapahiyaa vaahanon ke kaarobaar kaa nakshaa hi badalakar rakh diya
 He says, "over time, we topped the automobile business in Punjab

 Mittal recalls how he thought of many more projects before opening LPU

 If you have seen the Hollywood popular film The Dark Knight, you will remember how Bruce Wayne, with his powerful system setup, converts all cellular devices in the entire Gautham city into microphones
 aisi hi conspiresi theory hameshaa chalati he ki smartfones main install kiye gaye eps aapke smartphone ko microphone main tabdeel karke aapaki baaten sun rahe hai
 By doing this, companies also provide targeted advertising
 america kii northistern uniwarsity ke research dev cofnes ne is topic par lagbhag ek saal tak shodh kiya he
 He has researched the theory theory that smartphones secretly record conversations by turning on the microphone and giving more targeted advertisements
 dev northistern uniwarsity main computer and information science ke professor bhi hai
 Dave has completed this research in a year and during this time he has examined 17 thousand popular apps of Android
 is shodh se yah baat saamne ai he ki companiyon ko aapaki baatcheet sunne ke liye smartphone ko microphone main tabdeel karne kii jarurat hi nahin he
 Because even by doing this, they are able to give targeted advertisements
 hamane in dev cofnes kaa intervyuu kiya he or jaanane kii koshish kii he ki aakhir smartphone ko microphone main badal kar aawaaj record karne vaali theory ke peeche kaa logic kya he
 Q: Can we rule out the theory that companies are not recording your conversations via cellphone? Dave: Not entirely, but we have tested thousands of popular Android apps in which no such thing has come out
 ham is sambhaavna ko bhi nakaar nahin sakate hai ki duusare eps aapaki baatcheet record kar rahe hai
 It is also possible that the apps we tested do this first
 lekin is shodh ke aadhaar par ham ummid karte hai ki eps dwaara aapaki baatcheet record karnaa aam baat nahin he
 Q: You have tested 17 thousand apps
 aapaki jaanch ke aadhaar par koun si aisi bate hai jinase privesi chaahane vaale logon ke liye pareshaan karne vaali baat he
 Dave: Different people are afraid of different kinds of privacy problems
 maine yah paaya he ki baatcheet record karne yaa camera kaa acces lekar video yaa image record karne se zyada khatarnaak screen recording he
 Because screen recording provides more information about how you behave
 screen recording ke liye naa to kisi parmishan kii jarurat hoti he or na hi yujar ko iskaa notification miltaa he
 Q: What to do to avoid this kind of monitoring? How to be secure? Dave: In short, there is no silver bullet to solve this problem
 pehali cheez jo yujar kar saktaa he wo ye he ki jo eps smartphone me install kiye hue hai uskaa rivyuu karen or dekhen ki wo kya parmishan le rahaa he
 If not needed, remove them
 koi ap jarurat se zyada parmishan maang rahaa he to usase parmishan waapas len
 However, it is difficult to prevent screen recording leaks, as apps do not require any permission for this
 hamaari team ek software taiyaar kar rahi he jo is tarah kii activity ko detect karegaa
 It is not available for everyone at the moment, but later we will expand it
 Q: aapke shodh ke mutabik koun sa ap plateform is tarah kii recording or trekking ke maamle main zyada sicyor he
 Play Store or App Store? Dave: We don't have data to answer this question
 haalanki isse pehle kii study main hamane paaya tha ki sabhi plateform par ek tarah ke li hote hai
 One difference was that ios apps leak more locations than Android apps
 haalanki yah data teen saal pehle kaa he, isliye ham abhi ke rigelt ke bare main kuch nahin kah sakate hai
 After the congress-ncp and Shiv Sena formed a coalition government in Maharashtra, speculation is now being run with the cabinet

 vahiin sharad pavaar kii bhi bhoomika kaaphi ahm hogi
 Ideologically, there are seen as bridges between the completely different Congress and the Shiv Sena
 ensipi ko shivasena kii tulana main ek mantri pad zyada milegaa kyonki ek anya sahyogi congress ke vidhayak naanaa patole ko spikar chunaa gaya he
 Sources say that Sharad Pawar's most trusted Jayant Patil is going to get the post of Home Minister
 patil isse pehle bhi is mantralay main thode ke samay ke liye kaam kar chuke hai

 iske alaava sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar ko dipti siem kaa pad milegaa jinhone raat main bijepi ke saath milakar subah sarkaar bana lee thi or dipti siem ban gaye
 After this, there was a stir in the politics of Maharashtra
 lekin baad main supreme court ke bahumat sabit karne ke aadesh ke baad unhone apane pad se istipha de diya
 However, when asked on Thursday morning whether he was going to become deputy CM again, his reply was that the party would decide

 guuruuvaar ke hue party ke netaa ekanath scindia or subhash desai ne uddhav thakare ke saath shapath liya tha
 Both leaders have served in the previous government as cabinet ministers
 aapako bataa den naanaa patole ke chune ke baad maharashtra ke purv siem devendra fadanvis ko vipaksh kaa netaa niyukt kiya gaya

 The central government has banned the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), an organization led by separatist leader Yasin Malik
 yah pratibandh aatank virdohi kanoon ke tahat lagaaya gaya he
 The history of this organization is also old
 is sanghathan kii sthapana do logon ne milakar kii thi
 In which the first name was Maqbool Bhat and the second was Amanullah Khan
 is sanghathan kaa ek hi makasad tha kashmir kii aazaadee
 Who was Maqbool Bhat at that time India was a slave of the British and Kashmir was an independent state
 tabhi 1938 ke farvari maah main kupwada jile ke trahagaam main makabool bhat kaa janm hua tha
 When Maqbool was 11 years old, his mother died
 wo padhai likhaai main thik tha
 Time passed makabool ne srinagar ke saint steffens college se itihaas or raajnneetik vigyaan kii padhai puri kii
 After this Maqbool enrolled in Peshawar University of Pakistan for further studies
 vahaan makabool kii mulaakaat shaayar ahamed faraj se hui
 After meeting Faraz, Maqbool got a shayari
 chand dinon baad makabool ne vahaan ke ek urdu akhbaar main kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 After completing his education from the birth of J&K Liberation Front, Maqbool Bhat reached the British city of Birmingham from Pakistan
 vahaan uski mulaakaat kuch or logon se hui
 It was then planned to form the organization
 or usee yojana ko amali jama pahanaate hue makabool ne amanaullah khan ke saath milakar jammu-kashmir libration front banaaya
 The matter did not end here
 makabool bhat ne isi sanghathan kaa ek or wing banaaya
 Which was named as Jammu and Kashmir National Liberation Front (JKLNF)
 ye JKLF kaa wo wing tha, jisane baad main bhartiya sena or sashastr balon ke saath aamane-saamne kii ladaai kii
 Maqbool Bhatbharat returned to Kashmir was now free
 kashmir kaa vilay bharat main ho chukaa tha
 Therefore, in 1966 Maqbool Bhat came to India after many years
 yahaan aate hi wo kashmir ko aaazaad karaane kii awaz uthaane laga
 He had become a rebel
 bharat ke khilaaf bolne laga tha
 He began to associate youths with other different ideas with him
 jexlef ke wing JKLNF ke log bhi uske agenda par kaam kar rahe the
 He used to sing the freedom of Kashmir all the time
 bharat main makabool kii giraftaarisi bich ek din makabool or JKLNF kaa saamana police se ho gaya
 The shootout took place and a special partner of Maqbool was killed in the Aurangzeb encounter
 saath hi amar chand naamak ek police afasar bhi shahid hua
 The police then arrested Maqbool Bhat and another accomplice Kala Khan for the murder of Amarchand
 maamla darj ho chukaa tha
 The investigation was going on
 jaanch main makabool par dushman desh kaa agent hone kaa aarope laga
 He was sentenced to death after being prosecuted
 sajaa sunaae jane ke baad makabool ne adaalat main kaha tha ki wo dushman kaa agent nahin
 But India is an enemy of Colonial Mindset
 jail main surang banaakar bhaag niklaa tha makaboondaalat main makabool bhat ne apana gunaah kubul kar liya tha
 He was lodged in Srinagar jail
 lekin 1968 main ek din achaanak makabool apane do kaidi saathiyon kii madad se jail main surang banaakar faraar ho gaya
 Later, the police came to know that Maqbool Bhat had fled to Pakistan and fled to Pakistan
 makabool ne rachi thi plane haijacking kii sajeeshjanvari 1971 main indian airlines phokkar F27 friendship aircraft ‘ganga’ kaa apharan kar liya gaya
 The Kashmiri youths hijacked the plane
 jinaki pahchaan hashim kuraishi or ashraf bhat ke rup main hui
 Both of them hijacked the plane and reached Lahore
 plane se yatriyon or kru members ko baahar nikaala gaya
 And then that plane was set on fire
 bhartiya suraksha agenciyon ne makabool bhat ko is hijacing kaa mastermind bataaya tha
 Then Maqbool was arrested like this, after this incident, India demanded the government of Pakistan to arrest Maqbool Bhat
 na nukur karte hue pakistan ne makabool bhat ko arest to kiya lekin bharat ko nahin saunpa
 Then in 1974 Maqbool Bhat was released by the Government of Pakistan
 iske baad makabool bhat kuch samay pakistan main rahane ke baad bharat aa gaya
 He had no idea that Indian agencies were ambush for him
 jaise hi wo bharat aayaa use giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Maqbool was imprisoned in Tihar Jail
 Maqbool Bhat, the leader of JKLF, was earlier sentenced in India
 lihaaja uske pakade jane ke baad ye maamla phir garma gaya
 Maqbool Bhat filed a mercy petition against the then President Giani Zail Singh for his sentence
 lekin yachika daakhil hone ke baad makabool kii rihaai kii maang ko lekar JKLF ke aatankiyon ne birmingham main indian diplomat ravindra mahatre kaa katl kar diya
 The matter became more complicated
 nateeja ye hua ki raashtrapati gyani gel singh ne makabool bhat kii dayaa yachika naamanzoor kar di
 Maqbool Bhat was hanged in Tihar Jail, Delhi on 11 February 1984
 bataaya jaataa he ki uski laash ko bhi tihaad main hi dafn kar diya gaya tha
 Later, the co-founder of Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front Maqbool Bhat remained the inspiration of Kashmir's separatists for many years
 JKLF vaale bharat-pakistan ko nahin maanate
 He only talks about Kashmir and calls himself a Nationalist
