 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing the Chief Ministers in NITI Aayog's Governing Council last month, supported the idea of the january-december fiscal year
 sutron ne kaha ki is disha main shuruaati kaam chaalu he or aage isamen teji aegi
 Sources in the central government said that the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from July 1 is a step in this direction

 justise jagadish sharan verma1933-2013justise jagadish sharan verma 24 april ko aakhirkaar hamen chhodkar chal die
 His death has opened many doors to memories
 jehan main vahi jaani-pahachaani tasviir numaayan ho rahi he
 For the lawyers who came to his court, he was a slow and serious judge who acted with a keen sense of justice, rising above the techniques of law
 unke faislon ko padhgaye vaale jaanate honge ki justise verma supreme court ke kuch behad ahm faisle sunaane vaali khandpeeth kaa hissaa rahe
 These decisions define his journey as a judge for a decade
 sanghavaad se lekar dharmanirpekshata tak, mahilaon ko nyaay se lekar paryaavaran sambandhi nyaay tak, nyaayadhishon kii niyukti se lekar saansadon ko hataane tak
 He handled all the cases well
 lekin jis cheez ke liye ve hameshaa yaad kiye jaaenge, vah he unka ek aitihaasik kadam
 Under this, he introduced a process through which the Supreme Court investigates and monitors serious allegations filed against influential and dominant people
 jain hawala, chaara ghotaalaa or tantric chandraswami jaise maamalon ke dauraan unhone hi sunishchit kiya ki vyakti kitna hi bada kyon na ho, kanoon apana kaam karegaa
 He flatly refused to believe that the government had any control over the CBI probe into the allegations during the trial of the prosecution of senior government officials
 badakismati se faisle kii syaahi sookhne se pehle hi sarkaar ne ise radd karne kaa adhyadesh jari kar diya
 In these cases, the country saw that the Supreme Court had taken responsibility for a new role to teach accountability lessons to politicians who are being insensitive and corrupt
 nyaayik sakriyata ke pakshdhar justise verma ne hameshaa is baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa ki court ko unheen vivaadon main hastkshep karnaa chahie jinhen nyaayik mandandon ke aadhaar par nibataya ja saktaa ho
 His biggest feature was that when there was talk of doing something in his mind, he should be left doing it in any case, no matter how much criticism has to be faced for it
 mujhe vah vakya yaad aata he, jab unhone dilli main vaayu pradooshan vaale maamle main mujhe emicas curi yani nyaayik mitra niyukt kiya tha
 When he asked me to work as a judicial friend, i replied that a contradictory situation could arise in it
 asal main main pehle auto industry kii ore se pairvi kar chukaa tha
 He immediately told me that it would be even better because i already know the case well
 unhone is baat kii koi parvaah na kii ki adaalat ke galiyaaron main chakkar lagaate rahane vaale ‘‘dabang’’ sameekshak is bare main kya kahenge?unhone jammu-kashmir main khayr ke pedo ko kaatane ke liye die gaye ek theke ko chunauti dene vaali yachika ko janhit yachika main tabdeel kar diya tha
 It is known as the Forest Case not only in India but also in many other countries
 unki adhyakshata main ek peeth 1996 se unke ritair hone tak is maamle par sunwaayee karti rahi
 During the hearing of one such case, he wanted to give a decision in order to stop the felling of trees in the northeast forests
 is mode par tatkaaleen atorni general ne aakhri daleel kuch is tarah se pesh kii ki hamen bacchon ke paalane se lekar taabut tak, yahaan tak ki adaalat ke jis kamare main ve baithe hai, usamen lage panelon tak ke liye lakdi kii hi darkaar he
 Putting this argument aside, Justice Verma immediately replied that we should learn to live within the limits of our need without burdening nature
 adaalat ke unke kaksh main agar lakdi ke panel na lage hote to bhi unke faislon kii gunvattta waisi hi hoti
 The Supreme Court is not just a litany of resolving disputes, but also an institution that keeps a government process in check
 ek acha nyaayadhish dil or dimag donon kaa badshaah hona chahie, vah ek aisa shilpi or ejeeniyar ho jo kanoon ke rup ko sanvaarane ke liye lagaataar kaam kar rahaa ho taaki samtawadi nyaay ke sanvaidhanik lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye aavashyak saamaajik dhaanche ke nirmaan kaa uddeshy puraa kiya ja sake
 According to the time, all aspects of injustice have to be dealt with
 justise verma ne kanoon kaa rutaba or buland karne kii jarurat par bal diya
 In order to maintain the balance of secularism in the Ayodhya dispute, a separate solution from the court was needed
 aisi chunautiyon kaa saamana karne ke dauraan unhone dikhaa diya ki peeth kii shobhaa badha rahe diggajon main unka ooncha sthaan he
 He is entitled to stand in the line of judges who formulated a new judicial philosophy
 aisa darshan, jisane hamaare jaise ek trast ganraajya main loktantr ko surakshit rakhane main madad kii or jisane hamaari adaalat ko duniya kii shaktishaalee adaalaton main shumaar karavaaya
 Justice Verma merged in Panchatatva may not be with us in body form, but the legacy he has handed over to us will continue to help clean up the mess in our system

 com / y3esgtz48x After losing to South Africa at the World Cup, Sri Lanka's World Cup finals, along with the best players Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara, have ended in a one-day match
 jahaan jayavardhane test cricket ko bhi alavida kah chuke hai or ummid kii ja rahi he ki sangakaara bhi agast tak test cricket se sanyas le lenge
 Both players have set many records and given a new name to Sri Lanka Cricket
 kumaar sangakaara or mahela jayavardhane kaa janm ek saal or ek hi taarikh ko hua tha or donon kaa safar ek hi din hi khatm ho gaya
 Jayawardene was born on 27 May 1977 and Sangakkara was born on 27 October 1977
 jayavardhane sangakaara se paanch maheene bade the or sangakaara se teen saal pehle jayavardhane ne apana antarrashtriya cricket kariyar shuru kiya
 Jayawardene made his international debut against India in 1997, while Sangakkara played his first match against South Africa in 2000
 lekin agar record kii baat kiya jaae to sangakaara jayavardhane se kaaphi aage nikal gaye
 Sangakkara, who was fond of tennis as a child, watched cricket from behind the wicket most closely, knowing how many players' fortunes were contained inside the cricket globe
 sangakaara kehete hai ki agar aaj vah achche cricutter hai to uskaa shrey unki skool principal ko jaataa he
 Seeing his talent behind the wicket, the school principal encouraged him to play cricket
 bachapan main tennis khilne kii tamanna rakhane vaale sangakaara ne cricket main kai kirtiman kaayam kiye hai
 Sangakkara, playing 404 odis, has scored 14,234 runs at an average of around 42, which is the record for the most runs scored by a player after Sachin Tendulkar
 agar test match kii baat kiya jaae to sangakaara ne 130 test match se kareeb 59 kii ausat se 12,203 ran banaae he
 Sangakkara holds the record for scoring the most runs in Tests and one-day matches in Sri Lanka's cricket history
 wicket keeping main bhi sangakaara aage he
 Sangakkara has played a total of 482 players in 384 catches and 99 stumpings in 404 matches, keeping the best wicket in an ODI
 jayavardhane 149 test match khelte hue kareeb 50 kii ausat se 11,814 ran banaae hai
 This includes 34 centuries and 51 half-centuries and 374 runs is the highest individual score of his Test career which is a record for Sri Lanka
 srilanka ke liye sabase zyada ek-divasiy match khilne kaa record jayavardhane ke naam he
 Jayawardene has scored 12,650 runs at an average of around 34, playing 448 odis
 jayavardhane or kumaar sangakaara ne srilanka cricket ko ek nai raah di
 Both made several records
 sangakaara or jayavardhane kii jodi ne test match main sabase zyada saajhedaari kaa record bhi banaaya
 The two shared a 624-run partnership against South Africa in 2006, a world record
 aaj srilanka jarur haar gaya ho, lekin srilanka kii taraf se sabase zyada 45 ran kii pari sangakaara ne kheli
 When Sangakkara was out, a drizzle of rain started and the match had to be stopped for a while
 shaayad sangakaara ke shandaar kariyar ke liye barish bhi unhen badhai dena chaahati thi
 Many of the world's tallest bridges are built in China, although the highest bridge in the world (not by land height) is the Milau Viaduct in France, with a total height of 343 meters
 
 gauratlab he ki oonche pulon ke alaava china main anuthe pul bhi kai hai, jinamein se ek vah kaanch kaa pul he, jiskaa naam 'da haaohan kiyaao' (the Haohan Qiao) yaa 'bahadur mardon kaa pul' rakhaa gaya he
 This bridge is built on a moat in Hunan province of China, whose depth of 180 meters likewise makes the heart tremble, but it is not necessary to be 'spunky' to cross this bridge because of its height, but its Necessary because of another feature
 
 
 darasal, is pul kaa farsh, jo 300 meter lambaa he, puri tarah kaanch kaa bana hua he
 
 
 Notably, in addition to the high bridges, there are many unique bridges in China, one of which is the glass bridge, which is named 'the Haohan Qiao' or 'brave Men Bridge'
 yah pul china ke hunan praant main ek aisi khai par banaaya gaya he, jisaki 180 meter kii gaharaai vaise hi dil dahala detii he, lekin is pul ko paar karne ke liye 'diler' hona isaki oonchai kii vajah se zaruri nahin he, balki isaki ek or visheshta kii vajah se zaruri he
 
 
 Actually, the floor of this bridge, which is 300 meters long, is made entirely of glass

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that his government is on the way to double the income of farmers by 2022
 dilli main mangalvaar ko kisaanon kii aamadani doguni karne ke bare main ek sammelan main bolte hue modi ne kaha ki kisaanon kii aamadani ko doguni karne ke liye jo chijen jaruri he, sarkaar uske liye kadam uthaa rahi he
 He said that basically four things are needed for this
 yah 4 chijen hai- kisaanon kii laagat ko kam karnaa, nunatam samarthan mulya ko badhanaa, fasal kii barbaadi ko rokna or kisaanon kii aamadani ke liye atirikt strot paidaa karnaa
 Prime Minister Modi said that his government has moved fast to work on these four things and his government is working in a planned way to fulfill the plans which had been hanging for the last 25 years
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki sinchai yojanaon kaa vistaar karnaa ek aisa kadam he jisase kisaanon kii laagat kam karne main madad milegi
 For this, work is on to complete 99 irrigation projects and for this the government has allocated 80 thousand crore rupees
 modi ne kaha ki kisaan desh ke anndaata hai
 The condition of farming has improved in the last several years, but there has been no significant improvement in the condition of the farmers and there is uncertainty about their income
 sarkaar ne swyal card banane kaa kaam jor-shor se shuru kar diya he jisaki vajah se rasinic khaadon ke prayog main 10 fisadi kii kami ai he
 Modi said that the government is allocating more money to provide easy loan to the farmers
 unhone yaad dilaayaa ki bajet main vitt mantri arun jetali ne kisaanon kii laagat kaa dedh guna nunatam samarthan mulya dene kaa vaayada kiya he

 Our leaders are changing
 vah apni baton se, apane vyavhaar se, apni samvedansheeltaa se ek aam aadmi kii tarah dikhne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 They are trying to erase everything that happened that day with their repentance

 Perhaps there does not appear to be a tradition of accepting a mistake in politics or accepting a mistake like this

 It is the heart of a daughter that the father for whom the leaders of the sitting on the stage did not open, descending from the platform and the leaders whose feet should not move to stop it, today she is giving this assurance to those leaders
 
 
 aap mere ghar aaie, aapkaa koi virodh nahin hoga
 My father has left this world
 ve ab lautakar nahin aa sakate hai, to main kisi ko jimmedaar tehraakar kya karuungi
 'this is the heart of a farmer's daughter

 During his address at Fergusson College in Pune, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi questioned the current education system
 unhone 'aadhuniktaa chahie, pashchimikaran nahin' kaa mantra diya or kaha ki agar ham apni shiksha paddati apanaate to aaj kahin aage hote
 Narendra Modi said that he already had the desire to plant Savarkar and CV Raman's Raja from the forehead
 saavarkar ke kamare main unhone desh ke liye kuch karne kii takat mahasoos kii
 It is a privilege for him to speak here
 modi ne kaha ki log 'power' chaahate hai, par main 'ampowerment' chahta hum
 He strongly criticized the existing education system
 unhone kaha ki shiksha pehle 'main mekking mashin' thi, ab 'mani mekking mashin' ho gai he
 Modi said that he does not want to make any political comment from Savarkar's 'holy Land', but he made a lot of comments, although he did not name any party
 unhone kaha ki desh ke sheersh sansthaanon kii sthapana main hamaare mahapurushon kaa yogadan he, shashan-vyavastha kaa nahin
 Quoting a gazette of 1835, he said that Bengal had 100 per cent literacy at that time
 lekin kharaab nitiyon kii vajah se sakshartaa ghatati gai
 With the help of his hands, he did not miss the credit of Kerala's literacy from the Congress
 unhone kaha ki kerala desh main sabase zyada sakshartaa vaala rajya he to isamen shashan vyavastha nahin, balki shivgiri math ke narayan guru swami kaa yogadan he
 Who had made basic education system in the state more than a hundred years ago
 modi ne bataaya ki soshal cites par unhone suzav aamantrit kiye the
 After which he has received messages from 2500 youth from across the country
 unhone soshal site par sakriy rahane vaale yuvaaon or paroksh rup se apane samarthakon kaa bhi shukriya adaa kiya
 He said that the new generation is not just wearing jeans pants and long hair, she thinks on issues and wants to talk
 modi ne kaha ki ham vishwa ke sabase yuva desh hai
 Our future cannot be bleak
 hamen niraashaa ke maahaul se nikalnaa hoga
 Referring to Lokmanya Tilak, Modi said that Tilak had shown courage in challenging the British during slavery
 unhone kaha ki sthiti badali ja sakati he, par iske liye vijan kii jarurat he

 Rescuers in Southwest Japan dragged a baby girl out of a collapsed building in a dramatic fashion on Friday morning, more than six hours after the earthquake
 is bukamp main nau logon kii maut hui he
 Video footage provided by the 'national Police Agency' showed that the relief workers rescued the girl wearing pink pajamas from the wreckage of the demolished house
 yah ghatana kumamoto praant ke mashiki kasbe kii he, jahaan guuruuvaar raat 6
 There was an earthquake of 5 magnitude
 bacchee kaa naam nahin bataaya gaya he
 He is being told that he has not suffered any injuries
 bukamp kaa jhatka aane ke vakt bacchee kii maa, dada, daadi or bada bhai ek kamare tathaa rasoi main the, jabaki yah bacchee pehali manzil par ek anya kamare main so rahi thi
 The child's family members also survived
 unhone bhi bacchee ko bachaane kaa prayaas kiya tha, lekin ghar dhah gaya

 'rashtriya police agency' dwaara uplabdh karaae gaye video footage main dikhaaya gaya ki rahtakarmiyon ne dhwast ghar ke malbe se gulabi rang kaa pyjama pahani bacchee ko baahar nikaala
 The incident is from the town of Mashiki in Kumamoto province, where Thursday night 6
 5 tivrata kaa bukamp aayaa tha
 The name of the child has not been mentioned
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki use koi chot nahin lagi he
 During the earthquake, the child's mother, grandfather, grandmother and elder brother were in one room and kitchen, while the girl was sleeping in another room on the first floor

 bharat main samvidhan supreme he yaa jatigat or dharmik sanghathan
 Every month at an interval of two months, an organization stands up in the name of caste and religion and declares itself above the Constitution and the laws made therefrom
 aisi sansthaaon ko is tarah kii chhot kaise mil jaati he ki jab chaahe samvidhan kii tamaam dhaaraon ko nadi main pravaahit kar aate hai or khud apane aap ko vyavastha ghoshit kar dete hai
 Whatever happened in India in the name of faith in the 90s, now its franchise has opened
 frenchiji khulne kaa matlab he ki jo badi dukaan he wo chup rahati he or uski shah par choti choti dukaane aae din khulti hai or samvidhan ko chunauti dene lagati hai
 It is not that these institutions have only strength, no support
 bahut baar bahut zyaada samarthan hota he
 So the question arises that why do these ordinary and ordinary people also stand behind such organizations in the name of Social On Ban Shan, do they feel safe to take shelter of such organizations more than the Constitution
 aap sochiega
 Watch this procession of Rajput youth riding on a motorcycle on the morning of 25 January
 yah aam taur par nikalne vaale juluus se alag he
 There are only one caste in this group
 aakhir itane ladke shunya se to nahin aae hai
 It is evident that their procession also has social recognition, that is, the parents must have said that Ja Simran ja, ride a bike for his pride
 ek jati kaa pradarshan yaheen tak simit nahin he
 a picture of Muzaffarpur is not unknown to you
 haathon main talwaar kyon hai
 Do you think these swords have been drawn in honor of the constitution
 mukhyamantri log kaagazi aadesh jari kar rahe hai ki sakhti se karrwai karen lekin kya karrwai ho rahi he
 The Supreme Court orders that the film be released, but what will happen when the owners of cinema houses have less loyalty to the Supreme Court, more loyalty to these organizations
 ho saktaa he ki sabake liye vafadari na ho lekin tab aap yah sawaal kar sakate hai ki kya in cinema maalikon ne isliye film ko nahin chalaaya kyonki unhen un sansthaaon main hi bharosa nahin he ki jinka kaam sanvaidhanik vyavastha banaae rakhana he
 The Prime Minister had made seven resolutions that in five years, communalism and casteism would be eradicated, it was nice to hear, slogans were made in the advertisements but no comment of the Prime Minister has come about this violent gimmick which has been going on for three months
 na hi koi vipaksh kaa netaa saahas juta sakaa he ki iske kilaaf bol de
 Today the constitution stands alone
 ham koun sa cheharaa is samvidhan ko dikhaaenge jise lagu karne ke liye azaadi kii lambii chali ladaai main na jane kitne logon ne balidaan diya
 Is the parade of 26 January a parade of the display of items made of iron clad for us or is it a parade of standing up for the dignity of the Constitution
 bahut puraani nahin he rajasthan ke udaipur kii tasviir
 On the roof of the entrance of the court, the youth climb up with the saffron flag
 godi media ne chupake se is tasviir ko kinare laga diya
 The courts also remained silent
 kisi jaj ko yaad nahin rahaa ki samvidhan kii kitaab se chalane vaali imaarat ke bheetar dharmik dhvaj kaise aa gaya
 How daring to wave on his roof
 kaayade se iske liye zile main tainaat har tarah ke bade adhikari ko naukari se barkhaast kar dena chahie
 Nobody will tell you that when the boy arrested on this charge was released, he was taken back in the same way he had hoisted the saffron flag on the court
 usee udaipur kii yah tasviir 25 janvari kii hi he
 Again, these young men are gathering on the streets for the caste flag
 kya ve samvidhan kii maryaada ke liye jamaa hue hai yaa jati kii maryaada ke liye jamaa hue hai
 a film awakens caste self-respect within so many young people, then we also have a constitutional self-respect within you, asleep or half-awake
 ye log tu in van hote hai
 One day they go out in the name of caste and one day they go out to do Dadagiri in the name of protecting religion
 kab aapke chune hue netaa aise vakt main samvidhan ke haq main khadey dikhe
 If you call yourself a responsible citizen, what is that citizenship, where does the responsibility come from, does it not come from the Constitution? jab aap kehete hai ki aap bhartiya hai or is par garv hai to kya chhavi ubhartee he, dharm kii, parampara kii or kya in chhaviyon main samvidhan ke prati gaurav bhi shaamil hota he
 How many allegiances are there within you, whether there is loyalty to the Constitution or not to the allegiance of caste and religion
 kya yah kanfuzan isliye he ki aap abhi tak samvidhan ko samaj nahin paae yaa phir bahut se log yaa sanghathan apane bheetar samvidhan or panraparaaon ke naam par gundai kaa takaraav sulajhaa nahin paae hai
 The comments yah pehali baar to nahin he ki film kaa virodh ho rahaa he
 The film's protest is set up in such a way that caste loyalty is first instilled within a community and then approved by communal allegiance
 donon tarah kii nishthaaen isamen kaam kar rahi hai
 It is this allegiance that reminds you at the time of election that votes have to be cast for communal loyalty
 kyon ham baar baar aisi nishthaaon main, apana thikaana khojate hai? is mulk main teen maheene se film padmavat ko lekar bahes chal rahi he
 First it was run against the backdrop of Gujarat elections and now when the time of employment questions of the youth was coming which were holding torches, swords in their hands
 aap dinon din kamazor hote ja rahe hai
 You are falling prey to the same crowd you are in
 sanghathanon ke pravaktaa talwaar lekar studio kii bahes main aae, ek din bandook lekar bhi aaenge
 If this set up was not a back-up issue, then the Chief Ministers of the states would not appear silent
 ve rajput jati ke naam par bani senaaon ke saath khadey na hote
 The Chief Minister will be seen standing with the Constitution or with an army of any caste
 26 janvari se ek din pehle bharat kaa loktantr haar gaya he
 You have given this crowd so much permission that it can now attack a bus full of children
 is tasviir ko dekhie ki aapke bachche kis bharat main bada ho rahe hai
 It is not the case of today, it is also further, religion is being used in politics and swords are being used in religion
 ramanavami ke avasar par ramayana nahin talavaaron ko lekar juluus nikaale jate hai
 Do these organizations not trust the Constitution to protect them? kya hamane samvidhan ko sansthaaon kii imaaraton main hi lagu kiya, kya ham jan jan main isaki bhaavana ko lagu nahin kar paae hai
 Why the verdict is still in the hands of the crowd, the credibility of the Supreme Court in the name of a film is at stake
 jin cinema maalikon ne film kaa pradarshan nahin kiya he kya unhone supreme court ko thukraa nahin diya he
 Have not rejected the constitution? We want to discuss some similar questions today
 samvidhan kya he, hamaari naagarikta kya he
 The purpose of this show is also that millions of students who are unable to reach the constitution due to their poverty and enjoyment of richness, have some benefit
 25 janvari kii subah motorcycle par savaar rajput naujavaanon kaa yah juluus dekhie
 This is different from the procession that usually takes place
 is samooh main sirf ek jati ke log hai
 After all, so many boys have not come from zero
 zaahir he inke juluus ko saamaajik manyata bhi he yani maa baap ne bhi kaha hoga ki ja simran ja, apni shaan ke liye bike chalaa
 The performance of a caste is not limited here
 mujaffarpur kii ek tasviir aapke liye anjaani nahin he
 Why do you have swords in your hands? kya aapako lagata he ki ye talavaarein samvidhan ke sammaan main nikaali gayi hai
 The Chief Minister is issuing paper orders to take strict action but what action is being taken
 supreme court kaa aadesh he ki film release ho lekin tab kya karenge jab cinema ghar ke maalikon kii supreme court ke prati vafadari kam he, in sanghathanon ke prati vafadari zyaada he
 There may not be loyalty for everyone, but then you can question whether these cinema owners did not run the film because they do not have faith in the institutions whose job is to maintain constitutional order
 pradhanmantri ne saat sankalp liye the ki paanch saal main sampradayikta or jatvaad mitaa denge, sunne main acha laga, vigyapanon main slogan bana magar teen maheene se chal rahi is hinsak nautanki ke bare main pradhanmantri kii koi tippni tak nahin ai he
 Nor has any Leader of the Opposition been able to muster up the courage to speak out against it
 aaj samvidhan akelaa khadaa he
 We will show which face of this constitution which many people sacrificed in the long run of freedom to implement
 kya 26 janvari kii parade hamaare liye loha lakkad se bane saamaanon ke pradarshan kii hi parade he yaa yah parade samvidhan kii maryaada ke haq main khade hone kii parade he
 The picture of Udaipur in Rajasthan is not very old
 adaalat ke pravesh dwaar kii chat par bhagava dhvaj lekar noujvaan chadh jate hai
 The dock media secretly sidelined this picture
 adaalatein bhi chup rah gayi
 No judge remembers how the religious flag came inside the building run by the book of the Constitution
 uski chat par lahraane kaa dussahas kaise hua
 For this purpose, every kind of senior officer posted in the district should be dismissed from his job
 koi aapako nahin batayega ki jab is aarope main giraftaar ladke kii rihaai hui to use usee tarah shaan se waapas le jaaya gaya jis shaan se usne adaalat par bhagava dhvaj fahraaya tha
 This picture of the same Udaipur is only on 25 January
 phir se jatigat dhwaja liye ye noujvaan sadakon par jamaa hai
 Are they gathered for the dignity of the constitution or for the dignity of caste
 ek film itane naujavaanon ke bheetar jatigat swabhimaan jagaa detii he phir hamaare aapke bheetar koi sanvaidhanik swabhimaan bhi he, soya hua yaa aadha jaagaa hua hi sahi
 These people are two in one
 ek din jati ke naam par nikalate hai ek din dharm kii raksha ke naam par dadagiri karne ke liye nikalate hai
 When your elected leaders were seen standing in favor of the Constitution at such a time
 agar aap khud ko zimmedaar naagarik kehete hai to vah naagarikta kya he, uski zimmedaari kahaan se aati he, kya samvidhan se nahin aati he
 When you say that you are Indian and proud of it, what image emerges, of religion, of tradition and whether these images also include pride in the Constitution
 aapke bheetar kitni nishthaaen hai, kya jati or dharm kii nishthaaon ke saath samvidhan ke prati nishtha he yaa he hi nahin
 Is this confusion because you have not yet understood the constitution or many people or organizations have not resolved the clash of gundai in the name of constitution and traditions within you
 tippaniyan This is not the first time that the film is being opposed
 film kaa virodh is tarah se set ap kiya gaya he ki ek samudaay ke bheetar pehle jatigat nishtha paidaa ho jaae or phir use manzuri mili sampradayik nishtha se
 Both types of allegiance are working in it
 yahi nishtha he jo chunaav ke samay aapako yaad dilaati he ki vot sampradayik nishtha ke liye daalana he
 Why do we find our whereabouts in such devotions again and again? The film Padmavat has been debated in this country for three months
 pehle ise gujarat chunaavon kii prishthbhumi main chalaaya gaya or ab jab naujavaanon ke rojgaar ke sawaalon kaa vakt aa rahaa tha jo unke haath main mashaalen, talavaarein pakadaa di gayi
 You are getting weaker day by day
 aap jis bheed main hai usee bheed ke shikaar ho rahe hai
 The spokespersons of the organizations came to the studio debate with the sword, one day will also come with the gun
 yah set ap yani peeche se sajaayaa gaya masalaa na hota to rajyon ke mukhyamantri chup nahin nazar aate
 They would not have stood with armies formed in the name of Rajput caste
 mukhyamantri samvidhan ke saath khadaa dikhegaa yaa kisi jati kii sena ke saath
 India's democracy has lost a day before 26 January
 aapane is bheed ko itani manzuri di he ki vah ab bacchon se bhari bas par bhi hamalaa kar sakati he
 Look at this picture in which India your children are growing up
 aaj kii baat nahin he, aage kii bhi baat he, raajnneeti main dharm kaa istemaal ho rahaa he or dharm main talavaaron kaa istemaal ho rahaa he
 On the occasion of Ramnavami, a procession is taken out with swords, not Ramayana
 kya in sanghathanon ko samvidhan par bharosa nahin he ki unki raksha karegaa
 Have we implemented the constitution in the buildings of institutions, have we not been able to implement its spirit in the people
 kyon abhi bhi faisle kaa adhikaar bheed ke haathon main he, ek film ke naam par supreme court kii saakh daanv par lag gai hai
 Cinema owners who have not performed the film have not turned down the Supreme Court
 samvidhan ko nahin thukraayaa he? ham aaj kuch aise hi sawaalon par charchaa karnaa chaahate hai
 What is constitution, what is our citizenship
 is sho kaa makasad yah bhi he ki lakhon aise chaatr jo apni garibi ke kaaran or amiri kii mouj masti ke kaaran samvidhan tak nahin pahunch pate hai unhen kuch phayda ho
 The Supreme Court orders that the film be released, but what will happen when the owners of cinema houses have less loyalty to the Supreme Court, more loyalty to these organizations
 ho saktaa he ki sabake liye vafadari na ho lekin tab aap yah sawaal kar sakate hai ki kya in cinema maalikon ne isliye film ko nahin chalaaya kyonki unhen un sansthaaon main hi bharosa nahin he ki jinka kaam sanvaidhanik vyavastha banaae rakhana he

 amitabh bachchan kii superhit filmon main shaamil suryavansham kii sabase badi pahchaan ise channel par baar-baar dikhaaya janaa ban gai he
 It is also trolled many times on social media
 somvaar ko film ne 21 saal puure kiye hai
 The question that arises is what is it in Suryavansham movie that it is shown every second-third day
 iske do kaaran saamne aae hai
 The first is that the year the film was released, the same year Max Channel was launched
 donon ko ek jaisaa samay industry main hota ja rahaa he
 Hence the channel's officers have an emotional attachment to the film
 duusari vajah he ki channel ne is film ke adhikaar 100 saalon ke liye kharide hai
 Therefore, there is no restriction on never showing it
 dedpool 2 ne 3 din main kamaaye 33 karod, superhit hui aalia kii rajitisraa yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki film ko behad saraahaa jaataa he
 Amitabh Bachchan did a great performance in it
 kahani se lekar isaki editing or mujeec tak dilachasp he

 China has once again refused to support India's efforts to ban terrorist Masood Azhar at the United Nations
 china kaa kahana he ki vah masood ajahar ke maamle main apana rukh nahin badalegaa
 Not only this, China is currently not in a mood to change its attitude on India's entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)
 chinake videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa jeng shuang ne media brifing main ye jaankaree di
 When asked about India's Foreign Secretary s Jaishankar's statement, Jeng said that China is firm on its stand towards India regarding Masood Azhar and the NSG
 isamen koi badlaav nahin hoga
 India had advocated 'rational and practical' dialogue between the two parties in the case of NSG and Masood Azhar by applying to the United Nations
 lekin, tab china enesji main bharat kii entry ke khilaaf tha
 China argued that if India gets an entry in the NSG, then Pakistan should get it as well
 china ne enesji main bharat kii entry ke daawey ko is aadhaar par riject kar diya tha ki bharat ne enpiti par sin nahin kiye hai
 In such a situation, he cannot be included in the NSG
 iske pehle jab china ke videsh mantralay kii pravaktaa hua se you poocha gaya ki china ke is formule kaa uddeshy bharat ke sathpakistanki sadsyta par jor dena he, to unhone kaha, ‘aap bharat kii khabar kii baat kar rahe hai
 What i am saying is said by Director General Wang Kun
 china ne enpiti par hastakshar nahin karne vaale kisi desh vishesh ke pravesh par koi sthiti tay nahin kii he
 Therefore, there should be a proposal to include all non-npt countries first, then in relation to the entry of a particular non-npt country

 Due to this, Sanyam also had to leave his private school which also had a serious impact on Sanyam's studies
 sanyam ke pita anil ne bataaya kii wo vidisha main ek kiraane kii dukaan main kaam karte the
 But the income from his income was hardly able to afford the house
 anil ne ye bhi bataaya ki, ghar main paise kii baari tangi ke chalate wo kota main sanyam kii ejineering kii koching ke paise bhi dene main asamarth the
 5 students from India will participate in the American Rocket Science Competition, but despite all these problems, Sanyam explained to his father that he would study in a government school instead of private school and would prepare for JEE on his own

 The petition said that Nawaz Sharif's condition was deteriorating and his treatment was not available in the country

 aam aadmi partikiaitihaasik jeetne sabhi ko hairaan kar diya
 No one thought that the party would end the Congress and not only the BJP in this way
 dilli vidhansabha main congress kaa supada to saaf hua hi, bijepi ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The party was reduced to just three members
 kejariwal kii is nai party ne dashakon puraani party ko raajnneeti kaa sabak sikhaa diya
 Now the analysis of his victory and bjp's defeat will go on for a long time
 kai tarah ke kaaran dhunde jaaenge or kai tarah kii theory di jaaegi
 Big party leaders will continue to be criticized for bjp's defeat
 kai vishleshak to yah maan baithe hai ki party kii vijay kaa maarg ab ant ke kareeb he
 All things aside
 sachai yah he ki bijepi ko is haar main bhi apni jeet dekhni chahie
 It was the alarm bell that rang in time
 party ko ab chet janaa chahie
 He has to think about his ways and self-respect what went wrong
 party ko bihar or bengal main apni shakti kaa pradarshan karnaa hoga or iske liye jaruri he ki vah apni galatiyon se sabak le
 He made a lot of mistakes in this election and will have to analyze them one by one
 koi bhi raajnneetik dal sirf apane netaaon ke boote chunaav nahin jitati, agar vah jitati he to apane patibaddh or jamini kaaryakartaaon ke bal par
 Their full support and commitment make the party strong
 yah baat aam aadmi party kii is jeet ne phir sabit kiya
 But this time in the Delhi elections, the BJP neglected its workers and leaders a lot
 unki baaten nahin suni gai or saare aadesh upar se aate rahe
 In the distribution of tickets, the parties were given space and the self-power of the workers fell
 laga ki party koi raajnneetik dal na hokar koi company he jise uskaa siio chalaa rahaa he
 This proved fatal for the party
 yah chunaav party ko aatm chintan kaa behtareen mauka de rahaa he
 If she does this and works on it further, then there is no reason why she does not perform better
 dilli kii sabase badi anaaj mandi nayaa bazaar main aate ke thok vyapaaree veda prakaash kaa kaarobaar pichley aath dinon main ghatakar aadha rah gaya he
 Retail traders are unable to provide cash for the goods

 Says Rawat, "the government took a good step but lacked the preparations it had to make
 " That is, everyone wants the government to increase the cash limit for the traders, so that the business world can reduce the trouble
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki chote-bade kaarobaariyon kii mushkilon ko dur karne ke liye sarkaar kis tarah hastkshep karti he
 The impact of demonetisation is visible everywhere in the new market grain market
 cash kii kami kii vajah se khudara vyapaaree thok vyapaariyon se utana maal nahin kharid paa rahe hai jitna notebandi se pehle kharidte the
 The result is that the business has reduced by half

 " yani sabhi chaahate hai ki sarkaar vyapaariyon ke liye nakadi kii seemaa badhaaye jisase kaarobaar jagat kii pareshaani kam ho sake
 Now it has to be seen how the government intervenes to overcome the difficulties of small and big businessmen

 He was addressing the Vijay Shankhanad rally organized by the party here
 modi ne kaha, "aap log mujhe pradhanmantri nahin chaukeedaar banaaen or main desh ke khajaane par koi bhi panja nahin padane duungaa
 "modi said that the hut of the poor in this country is inhabited by the exploits of the ancestors of Shahzade (rahul Gandhi)
 modi ne kaha, "aadhi se puri roti tak aane main yadi 60 varsh kaa samay laga to puri se bharpayt roti tak aane main 100 saal kaa samay lagegaa
 You gave the Congress a chance to rule for 60 years
 bhaajapa ko 60 maheene kaa samay dijie
 We will change both the fate and the picture of the country
 " Modi said that he has not come to cry and shed tears
 vah garibon va kisaanon ke aansu ponchney kaa sankalp lekar aae hai
 At the rally, Modi asked the public whether the people of Bundelkhand do not have the power to develop
 Replying to this himself, Modi said that the farmers here have power, but the governments of Lucknow and Delhi have no power
 modi ne dilli kii centre sarkaar se poocha ki jahaan-jahaan congress kii sarkaar he, vahiin par kyon sabase adhik kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 The reason for this is that the Congress government does not care about the village, the poor and the farmer
 congress chunaav main revadi baantati he or package kii baat karti he
 This package came in Bundelkhand to silence the leaders of Uttar Pradesh
 modi ne is maukey par musalamaanon or sikhon ko bhi lubhaane kii koshish kii
 Taking a dig at Rahul Gandhi's recent statement, Modi said that the Congress Vice President should name the Muslim youth who are in contact with Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI, otherwise publicly apologize to those youths
 modi ne kaha ki congress ke shahjade rahul gandhi ne mujffarnagar dange ke peedit naujavaanon par gambhir aarope lagaaya he ki vahaan shiviron main rah rahe kuch muslim yuvak iesai ke sampark main hai
 He questioned Rahul that his party has a government at the Center
 aise main yadi itnaa gambhir maamla aa gaya he to sarkaar kya kar rahi he? modi ne kaha ki rahul tatkaal aise logon kaa naam ghoshit karen nahin to desh ke un naujavaanon se maafee maangen
 Modi also questioned the intelligence agencies of the central government and said why the intelligence agencies are giving secret reports of the country to the person who is a mere MP and who has not taken any oath of secrecy
 modi ne sikh samudaay kii hamadardi batorne kii bhi koshish kii
 He pointed to Rahul Gandhi's statement in which he said that i was very angry when my grandmother (indira Gandhi) was killed
 modi ne kaha ki yah sach he ki daadi kii hatya par rahul ko gussa aayaa hoga, congressiyon ko bhi gussa aayaa tha, lekin uske baad jab unke logon ne hajaaron sikhon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya or naujavaanon ko jinda jala diya to kya us par bhi unhen gussa aayaa tha? yadi aayaa hota to aaj tak is maamle main kisi ek bhi doshi ko sajaa kyon nahin mili
