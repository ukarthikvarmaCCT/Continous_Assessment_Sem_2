 The first is that its superstars did not have a good experience with DRS in the initial days and secondly BCCI believes that this is not entirely correct
 bhartiya superstar cricketron ko chahie ki bahumat ke faisle ko maane or diares ko sweekaar karen
 Greg said, India's partisan attitude towards Test cricket and its stand on certain issues, attitude towards ICC corruption investigation, apathetic attitude towards expeditious enforcement of anti-doping rules, alleged corruption of IPL and former Australia Prime Minister Its role in the absence of a process to prevent John Howard from becoming the ICC vice-president is a few examples
 greg ne bisisiai par chote deshon ko dhamkaakar isisi kii baithkon main unke vot hathiyaane kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 He said, the BCCI has more control over cricket, as it has enough votes to oppose any resolution in ICC meetings
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki kuch deshon kaa guzaara bharat se milane vaali aarthik sahaayta ke bina nahin chal saktaa
 "many problems of the ICC will be solved if India accepts that cricket is more important than earning crores of dollars and making cricketers richer," Greg said
 unhone diares sweekaar nahin karne ke liye bhi bisisiai ko aade haathon liya
 The comments unhone kaha, yah khel ke liye acha nahin he, jab media kii sukhiryon main kharaab faisle hon, jinase khel ke nattejey par asar padaa ho
 DRS is not 100 per cent correct, but it can overcome the shortcomings of umpires' decisions
 greg ne kaha, ise thukaraane ke bharat ke paas do kaaran hai
 The first is that its superstars did not have a good experience with DRS in the initial days and secondly BCCI believes that this is not entirely correct
 bhartiya superstar cricketron ko chahie ki bahumat ke faisle ko maane or diares ko sweekaar karen
 Greg also accused the BCCI of grabbing their votes in ICC meetings by threatening smaller countries
 unhone kaha, cricket par bisisiai kaa niyantran adhik he, kyonki iske paas isisi kii baithkon main kisi bhi prastaav kaa virodh karne ke liye paryaapt vot hote hai
 The reason for this is that the survival of some countries cannot go on without financial help from India
 greg ne kaha, isisi kii kai samasyayen sulajh jaaengi, yadi bharat sweekaar kar le ki karodon dollar kamaane or cricketron ko dhankuber banane se adhik mahatvapurn cricket kii bhaavana he
 He also slammed the BCCI for not accepting DRS
 tippaniyan He said, this is not good for the game, when there are bad decisions in the media pleas that have affected the outcome of the game
 diares sau fisadi durust nahin he, lekin isse ampiron ke faislon kii kamiyon ko dur kiya ja saktaa he
 Greg said, India has two reasons to reject it
 pehla yah ki iske superstars kaa shuruaati dinon main diares ke saath anubhav acha nahin rahaa or doosraa bisisiai kaa maananaa he ki yah puri tarah durust nahin he
 Indian superstar cricketers must accept the majority verdict and accept the DRS

 On the other hand, the BJP is currently running governments in 14 states on its own and is a junior partner in a coalition government in 5 states

 Reversing Finance Minister p Chidambaram, BJP leader Yashwant Sinha said that Chidambaram has always done a 'fake' in the budget
 isse purv, chidambaram ne yashavanth sinha par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki purv vitt mantri sinha ke kaarykaal main bhartiya arthvyavastha ne udaarikaran ke baad ke sabase kharaab saalon ko dekha
 Yashwant Sinha issued a statement saying, "I may have been the worst finance minister after 1991, but i did not commit fraud"
 chidambaram 1991 ke baad ke sabase chaalaak vitt mantri rahe hai, or unhone keval is saal nahin, balki hameshaa hi farjivada kiya
 Rejecting Chidambaram's claim to curb the fiscal deficit, he said that the game has been done with the figures by postponing subsidy payments and cutting plan expenses by Rs 80,000 crore
 sinha ne kaha, unhone antarim bajet main farjivada kiya or agali sarkaar unke jhooth ko saamne laane ke liye ek shwetapatr laaegi
 Citing an article, Sinha said that in the budget of 1997-98, Chidambaram made fiscal deficit 4 of GDP
 5 pratishat par rakhane kaa lakshya tay kiya tha
 When the next government presented the budget for 1998–99, the deficit increased to 5
 8 pratishat pahunch gaya
 He said, instead of challenging me on the basis of facts, Chidambaram decided to attack me personally
 main unhen yaad dilaanaa chaahunga ki vitt mantralay main 12 saal pehle khatm hua kaarykaal meraa kaarykaal nahin tha, jis par vah sawaal khadaa karte hai
 On the economic front, it was the execution of Chidambaram and Manmohan Singh, which is being questioned in this election

 This is the only question in the hearts of viewers of Hindi films - what will happen to superstar Salman Khan on Wednesday, May 6
 
 
 ? kya salmaan khan 'hit and ran' maamle main doshi qaraar die jaaenge, yaa nirdosh maane jaaenge
 
 
 The jab sabhi chaahane waalon ke man main yahi sawaal ghumad rahe hon, to bhala satorie kaise peeche rahete, so, logon kii isi utsukata kaa phayda uthaate hue unhone karodon rupee kaa satta inhen sawaalon par lagaaya he, or dilachasp tathy yah he ki satta bazaar se jude logon kii baton par bharosa kiya jaae to is vakt salmaan khan par lage satte ne indian premier lig (ipel) par lagane vaale satte ko bhi pachhad diya he, haalanki salmaan khan par ab tak kitne rupee kaa satta lag chukaa he, iskaa koi sateek aankada mil paanaa mushkil he

 salmaan khan ko lekar unke doshi yaa nirdosh qaraar die jane lekar is baat tak par satta lagaaya ja rahaa he ki unhen kitne saal kii sazaa sunai ja sakati he
 According to Danish, who keeps a close watch on Satta Bazar and informer of Mumbai Police, the price of Salman Khan's conviction is 30 paise, while the price of Rs
280 paise is Rs
280 if he is acquitted
 isi tarah doshi sabit hone ke baad unhen paanch saal kii sajaa sunaae jane kaa bhav 1 rupaya 30 paise he, jabaki saat saal kaid kii sajaa kaa bhav 2 rupee 50 paise he
 The comments vaise, satta in atakalon par bhi lagaaya ja rahaa he ki vah faisle ke turant baad jail jaaenge, yaa unhen jamaanat par philhal chhod diya jayega
 Whether or not Salman Khan will go abroad will be banned
 duusari ore, mumbai police kaa kahana he ki satta chaahe cricket par lage yaa salmaan khan par, galat he, so, agar koi bhi is tarah kii kisi gatividhi main lipt paaya jaataa he to uske khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 For this, the social branch of Crime Branch has been alerted
 mumbai police kii isi sakhti ke chalate zyaadaatar satorie mumbai ke baahar, khaskar gujarat, bengaluru, dubai or bainkak se apane kaale kaarobaar ko anjaam dene main lage hai
 When the same questions are rolling in the minds of all the seekers, how could the bookies stay behind, so, taking advantage of this eagerness of the people, they have betted crores of rupees on these questions, and the interesting fact is that from the speculative market If the people involved are to be believed, then the betting on Salman Khan has also beaten the betting on the Indian Premier League (IPL), although Salman Khan But it is difficult to find an exact figure of how many rupees have been speculated so far
 satta bazaaron main aise bahut kam maukey aate hai, jab adaalat ke kisi faisle ko lekar is tarah kii sattebaazi ho, lekin salmaan khan 'bade' or lokapriy kalakaar hai or unke karodon fain hai, so, satorie is baar iskaa phayda uthaane main jute hue hai
 Salman Khan is being betted on how many years he can be sentenced for his conviction or acquittal
 satta bazaar par kareeb se nazar rakhane vaale or mumbai police ke mubir danish ke mutabik salmaan khan ke doshi sabit hone kaa bhav 30 paisa he, jabaki unhen nirdosh qaraar die jane par bhav 2 rupee 80 paise he
 Similarly, after being convicted, the punishment for sentencing them to five years is 1 rupee 30 paise, while the punishment for imprisonment for seven years is 2 rupees 50 paise
 tippaniyan By the way, speculation is also being made on speculation that he will go to jail soon after the verdict, or he will be released on bail for the time being
 salmaan khan ke videsh jane par pabandi lagaai jaaegi yaa nahin
 On the other hand, the Mumbai Police says that whether the betting is on cricket or on Salman Khan is wrong, then if anyone is found involved in any such activity, strict action will be taken against him
 iske liye krime branch kii samaaj seva shakha ko sachet kar diya gaya he
 Due to this strictness of the Mumbai Police, most of the bookies are operating their black business outside Mumbai, especially from Gujarat, Bengaluru, Dubai and Bangkok

 Paid News is another fellow of Fake News
 paisa lene kaa tatv ped news main bhi he or phek news main bhi he
 What is the terror of paid news in elections? Ask any candidate of any party
 ab ped news ke kai tareeke aa gaye hai
 As soon as the election comes, there is a flood of sting operations against the opposition parties, in the survey, the opposition is said to be weak
 upi chunaav main galat survey chhapane ko lekar vivaad bhi hua tha
 It happens in paid news that with the money, news is published about the candidate that there is a huge rush, there is a wave of so-and-so
 isi kii nai peedi he phek news
 When we searched on the internet about paid news, many information came out
 aap jaanate hai ki har chunaav main ped news pakadaney ke liye rajya str or zila str par chunaav ayog Media Certification and Monitoring Committees (MCMC) banaata he
 In 2013, a report of the Election Commission came out, according to which 1400 paid news cases were reported in 17 state assembly elections
 ye sabhi chunaav 2010 se 2013 ke bich hue the
 In the 2012 Punjab Assembly elections, 523 cases of paid news were reported
 2012 ke gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main ped news ke 414 maamle saamne aae
 The 2012 Himachal Pradesh election saw 104 cases
 2013 ke karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main ped news ke 93 maamle saamne aae the
 The form of media in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was unprecedented
 yah chunaav bhi ped news se batch nahin sakaa tha
 Many times paid news cases are also not reported
 unke tareeke itane badal gaye hai ki pakadana bhi mushkil hota he or abhi tak ped news ko alag se paribhaashit nahin kiya gaya he or na hi iske liye sazaa kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 There were 787 cases of paid news in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 sabase adhik 223 maamle rajasthan se or 152 maamle punjab se darj hue the
 116 cases have been registered in Andhra Pradesh and 86 in Uttar Pradesh
 andhra main 116 conform cese the, lekin 2168 notice jari hue the ped news ke sambandh main
 In the 2014 election, 3100 notices were issued to candidates in the case of paid news
 ped news nahin ruk rahaa he or phek news bhi aa gaya he
 Paid news cases were also reported in the 2017 Punjab and UP assembly elections
 23 farvari 2017 ke newaloundry kii site par isaki khabar he ki goa or manipur main ped news kaa ek bhi maamla darj nahin hua tha
 We have not yet been able to free our elections from violence and booth capturing
 paise pakade jate hai magar paise kaa istemaal abhi tak nahin rukaa he
 In October 2011, the membership of UP MLA Umlesh Yadav was rejected on the charge of paid news
 rashtriya parivartan dal kii vidhayak thim
 But a large party candidate has not been dismissed while doing paid news
 is kram main ek or netaa pakade gaye hai jinka maamla adaalat main bhi sabit ho gaya he
 Narottam Mishra is the minister of Madhya Pradesh
 dilli hoicourt ke aadesh ke mutabik narottam mishra raashtrapati chunaav main matdaan nahin kar sakenge
 The Madhya Pradesh High Court has found Narottam Mishra guilty in the 2008 Assembly elections in a paid news case
 chunaav ayog ne narottam mishra par teen saal ke liye chunaav ladane par pratibandh laga diya he
 In this context, Narottam Mishra will not be a candidate in the 2018 assembly elections
 ayog ne paaya ki narottam mishra ne 2008 ke chunaav main datia vidhansabha main ped news par karch kii gai rakam ko apane karche main nahin dikhaaya he
 Narottam Mishra is currently the Minister of Water Resources, Public Relations and Parliamentary Affairs
 ped news ke maamle main doshi paye jane ke baad bhi pad par bane hue hai
 Mishra is fighting for justice
 unhone naitikta kaa lod lekar turant istipha dene kii koi jaldbaazi nahin kii he
 Be cautious about one thing
 media ko phek news kehane main khatra he
 Leaders like Trump are taking advantage of this by calling news channels as fake news
 jo phek news he use hi phek news kaha jaae
 Journalists are expected to confirm the news three or four times before printing it, but now you are also expected to confirm with many sources before you believe the news
 kahin aisa na ho jaae ki jo khabar akhbaar main padhi he use conform karne ke chakkar main offis janaa hi bhul jaaen
 Now the whatsapp group of News Housing Society has also started coming
 netaaon ke apane twitor handle hai, you tub channel hai
 What will you do if you are telling the same lie
 raajnneetik dalon ne whatsap group main mohalle tak ke logon ko gher liya he
 By creating members of the group, they continue to throw political trash, most of which is fake news
 is siries ke shuru main hamane aapako milinium bag yani vaai tu ke kaa udhaaharan diya tha, ab aapako 2001 ke dilli or uttar bharat ke kai ilaakon main faile manki main kaa udhaaharan dena chaahate hai
 The Monkey Man was neither a monkey nor a man, but the man, the Children's Children, was lost in fantasies of the Monkey Man's arrival and bite
 raat bhar jaagate the
 No one saw him but there was no shortage of people to tell him how Monkey Man is
 phek news ham sabakaa yahi haal karne vaala he
 We will wake up at night with regard to fake news, watch the communities fighting, see someone beating, rather they are watching
 manki main kaa udhaaharan isliye de rahaa hum taaki yah saaf rahe ki phek news ko pachaane kii practice ham aaj se nahin kar rahe hai
 At that time the media also covered Monkey Man very well
 enditivi ke archive main manki main ko lekar kai report hai
 Which was covered by Siddharth Pandey, Barkha Dutt, Aradhana Sharma, Vartika Nanda, who were then with NDTV
 manki main cover karne waalon main amitabh revi, sera jacob, maaya mirchandani ab bhi enditivi ke saath hai
 NDTV was not India then, it was Star News
 ham puraani report or usamen logon ke bayaan ko dikhaanaa chaahate hai taaki aapako pataa chale ki phek news yaa afvaah hamaari kya haalat karata he
 In between, it continues to be trialled as if it were unknowingly done by putting a bright picture of the border between Spain and Morocco
 aise anek udhaaharan hai
 As far as i remember, Monkey Man's first news was printed in a Hindi newspaper in UP somewhere in the corner but there is no clipping to prove it
 pehle ham kuch puraani report dekhte hai
 The report then was not longer than one and a half minutes
 angrezi se ghabaraane kii zarurat nahin he na hi hindi ke naam par nakli gaurav gaan karne waalon ke jhaanse main aane kii zarurat he
 Like monkey man, fake news also comes in disguise to mislead you
 manki main ko lekar kalpanaaen hawa main udne lageen
 Everyone said about the Monkey Man in such a way that you would laugh and laugh with laughter
 par hansate bhi rahiye or sochate bhi rahiye ki kahin phek news ne aapaki aisi haalat to nahin kar di he
 The monkey man had such a ruckus that the police and government too got busy with it
 kabhi police ne kaha ki asaamaajik tatwon kaa kaam he
 According to eyewitnesses, there are at least two people who are executing together
 bataaiye chashmadid ko yahi pataa nahin ki manki main kaisaa dikhataa he, sabake alag alag vivaran aapane sune hi magar unke aadhaar par police maanane lagi kii do log hai
 At that time it was expected from the Delhi Police that they make portraits of Monkey Man like terrorists after terror attacks
 ek baar to police ne kah diya ki na to wo insaan he na hi bandar he, koi or jaanavar he
 When society goes mad, it affects the work of the police
 police kya karti
 Throughout the night people would be terrorized, some would fall from somewhere, or some would see their own shadow and shout Monkey Man Monkey Man
 ant main haar kar dilli police ne 50,000 kaa inaam rakh diya
 Rapid Police Force was sought from the Home Ministry
 is maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue ek vishesh team bana di gai jiskaa kaam tha manki main kii jaanch karnaa
 We were not matured during Monkey Man's time, so people kept jumping all night
 phek news ke samay ham paripakv ho chuke hai
 Those found get silenced and start living in perceptions
 phek news ko pachaane kii hamaari kshamta main sudhaar bhi hua he or vikaas bhi
 This change has come in India as well as in the world
 ab log kai maamalon main iske aadhaar par raajnneetik faisle lekar khud kar garv se jaagruk matadaata bhi kehane se nahin chookte hai
 No one can understand the pain of Hillary Clinton, nor can you understand the happiness of Donald Trump
 ek phek news kaa maaraa he or ek phek news kaa badshaah he
 Haider was a film co-written by Basharat Pir
 achche patrkaar hai or inaki kitaab he karfu nite
 Basharat also has a report on Monkey Man
 20 june 2001 kii unki story bataati he ki dilli police ne manki main ke rahasy se pardaa uthaa diya he
 The report of the expert committee said that there was no monkey man
 is story main us vakt ke joint kamishnar suresh raay ne kaha he ki manki main main bandar yaa koi bhi jaanavar shaamil nahin he
 The Expert Committee also had members from the National Institute of Human Behavior (NIHB) and Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL)
 police ne yah bhi kaha ki manki main ke peeche pakistan ke iesai kaa haath nahin he
 Nor is the hand of any goon gang
 dilli police ke kamishnar ajay raaj sharma ne to pachaas hazaar kaa inaam bhi rakh diya tha
 They thought it was a gang job
 saal 2001 kaa may or june maheenaa manki main main hi biit gaya
 Police received 379 phone calls
 303 bogus nikle
 70 people were injured
 ek cese main main the uttar purv dilli ke raghunatha pathak ko unke bhai ne hi maaraa tha
 People started imagining different types
 police ne mana ki media ke kawarej ne is paagalpan ko or badha diya
 Let me tell you that at that time many channels had formed a team of five reporters for Monkey Man's Bite
 jo raat bhar dilli main ghumaa karte the
 Many of them are prime time anchors today
 zaahir he 2001 main manki main ke zariye jo practice kiya tha, wo ab kaam aa rahaa he
 By the way, in the year before 2012, our channels also ran a lot that the world was going to end
 phek news naam main bhale junior ho magar is kaam main bharat ke news vaale bhi kam senior nahin hai
 Thankfully, people also understood that all is nonsense
 notebandi ke dauraan 2000 ke note main kisi chip ke lage hone kii khabar dikhaa di gai
 As a result of demonetisation, terrorism and Naxalism were also claimed to be erased or stopped
 pehali baar aatankwaad or naksalwad ko mitaane ke liye duniya main notebandi kaa sahaara liya gaya
 The difference is that black money is now being caught in new notes
 kuch log aaj bhi 2000 ke note main chip khoj rahe hai jo he hi nahin
 At the same time, the Reserve Bank of India denied that there is no such chip in the note
 us samay paanch sau or hazaar ke saadhe chaudaa lakh karod rupee chalan main the
 This was the statement of Minister Santosh Gangwar
 aaj tak rigerv bank of india nahin bataa sakaa ki notebandi ke baad 500 or 1000 ke kitne note waapas aae
 Recently, Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel could not tell before the Parliamentary Committee how much of the note was returned
 unka kahana he ki noton kii ginati chal rahi he
 The Reserve Bank has floated a tender to purchase a counting machine
 garvanar ne janvari main sansadeey samiti se kaha tha ki agali baar jab samiti ke saamne haazir honge to bataa denge ki kitne note waapas aae
 It is important to know how many notes have come back because only then will you know how many fake notes or black money were in circulation
 agar 14
 If 50 lakh crores comes then how will the demonetisation be successful
 is par purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne chutki lete hue kaha he ki notebandi ke aath maheene baad agar reserve bank counting kii mashin kharid rahaa he to kam se kam leez par le saktaa tha
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted, tweeting that the government needs a math teacher, someone should apply to the PMO
 vaise jab aapse bank gin kar note lete hai, to rigerv bank ko bhi gin kar hi dete honge
 When banks counted the notes returned during demonetisation only then how the Reserve Bank is not able to count till now
 kya rigerv bank ye nahin bataa saktaa ki bainkon ne apni taraf se gin kar itane note diye hai
 We are counting on our side one more time
 shaayad manki main kii parighatna abhi samaapt nahin hui he
 Its new items keep coming in between and we have proved every time that whatever the rumor is, we will definitely believe it
 afvaah failaane waalon ko ham logon ne kabhi niraash nahin kiya he
 The comments 1995 main ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilane kaa lesan hamen abhi tak thik thik yaad he
 Then in November 2016, people of many states of the country got lined up in front of shops that there was going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 is maamle main dilli, kolkata, mumbai or hyderabad ke logon ne bhi chote shaharon ke saath acha pradarshan kiya tha
 The message came from whatsapp that there is going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 upi ke tatkalin mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav afvaah bataate rahe or ziladhikari ko nirdesh dene lage ki afvaah failaane waalon par sakht karrwai karen
 What a good thing that punishment is for those who spread the word, but no punishment for those who believe the rumor
 dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal or kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ko bhi bayaan dena padaa ki namak kii koi kami nahin he
 What about the rumors, that she flew to Mumbai, that the salt has reached 200 rupees a kg
 mumbai police ko twit karnaa padaa ki ye afvaah he
 It has also been reported from many places that shopkeepers are really selling 200 to 600 rupees of salt
 aapmen se koi ye pard rahe hai to pleez email kiijie taaki ham jaan saken ki afvaah par yakeen kar 600 lutaaney ke baad ab aap kaisaa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 The Hyderabad police was also working very hard to stop this rumor
 ham phek news se niraash isliye bhi nahin hote kyonki hamane kabhi bhi phek news ko niraash nahin kiya he
 Delhi 6 was created by Rakesh Omprakash Mehra in 2009
 yah film bhi manki main par aadhaarit thi
 It was necessary to mention Monkey Man
 ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilaa liya
 The world computer was also seen under Y2K, monkey man also suffered and now he is facing fake news
 main yah soch rahaa hum ki ab ham iske aage kya karne vaale hai
 Whatever will happen, what new version of fake news is going to make us mad
 2013 main chunaav ayog kii ek report ai thi, jiske anusaar 17 rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon main ped news ke 1400 maamle saamne aae the
 All these elections were held between 2010 and 2013
 2012 kaa punjab ke vidhansabha chunaav main ped news ke 523 maamle saamne aae the
 The 2012 Gujarat assembly election saw 414 paid news cases
 2012 ke himachal pradesh ke chunaav main 104 maamle saamne aae
 There were 93 cases of paid news in the 2013 Karnataka Assembly elections
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main media kaa jo rup tha wo abhootpurv tha
 This election also could not escape from paid news
 kai baar ped news ke maamle report bhi nahin hote hai
 Their methods have changed so much that it is difficult to catch up and yet paid news has not been defined separately nor has punishment been provided for
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ped news ke 787 cese saamne aae the
 The maximum number of 223 cases were reported from Rajasthan and 152 from Punjab
 andhra pradesh main 116 or uttar pradesh main 86 maamle darj hue hai
 There were 116 confirmed cases in Andhra, but 2168 notices were issued regarding paid news
 2014 ke chunaav main ped news ke maamle main ummidavaaron ko 3100 notice jari kiye gaye the
 Paid news is not stopping and fake news has also arrived
 2017 ke punjab or upi ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi ped news ke maamle darj kiye gaye
 On 23 February 2017 Newslaundry site reported that not a single case of paid news was registered in Goa and Manipur
 ham abhi tak apane chunaavon ko hinsa or booth capcharing ke alaava in durgunon se mukt nahin kar paae hai
 Money is caught but the use of money has not stopped yet
 oktober 2011 main ped news ke aarope main upi kii ek vidhayak umalesh yadav kii sadsyta khaarij kar di gai thi
 Was an MLA of Rashtriya Parivartan Dal
 magar kisi bade dal kaa ummidavaar ped news karata hua barkhaast nahin hua he
 In this sequence, another leader has been caught, whose case has also been proved in court
 narottam mishra madhya pradesh ke mantri hai
 According to the order of Delhi High Court, Narottam Mishra will not be able to vote in the presidential election
 madhya pradesh hai court ne narottam mishra ko 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav main ped news ke maamle main doshi paaya he
 The Election Commission has banned Narottam Mishra from contesting elections for three years
 is lihaaz se narottam mishra 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaav main ummidavaar nahin ban paayenge
 The Commission observed that Narottam Mishra did not show the amount spent on paid news in the Datia Assembly in the 2008 elections in his expenditure
 narottam mishra is vakt jal sansaadhan, jansampark or sansadeey kaary mantri hai
 He remains in office even after being found guilty in the paid news case
 mishra ji nyaay ke liye lard rahe hai
 He is in no hurry to resign immediately with a load of morality
 ek baat ko lekar satark rahiyegaa
 The media is in danger of being called fake news
 iskaa laabh trump jaise netaa uthaa hi rahe hai news channelon ko phek news kahkar
 The fake news is called fake news
 patrakaron se ummid kii jaati he ki khabar chhapane se pehle teen chaar baar pushti kar len lekin ab aapse bhi ummid kii jaati he ki khabar par yakeen karne se pehle kai sorce se conform kar len
 It should not happen that you forget to go to the office to confirm the news which you have read in the newspaper
 ab to news houseing sosayadi ke whatsap group se bhi aane laga he
 The leaders have their own tweeter handles, youtube channels
 vahi jhooth bol rahe hon to aap kya karenge
 Political parties have surrounded people up to the locality in the whatsapp group
 group kaa member banaakar siyaasi kachra thelte rahete hai jisamen se zyaadaatar phek news hi hota he
 In the beginning of this series, we gave you an example of the Millennium bug, that is, to two, now you want to give the example of Monkey Man spread in 2001 in Delhi and many areas of North India
 manki main na to manki tha na hi main tha magar main, vimen children manki main ke aane or kaat lene kii kalpanaaon main kho gaye
 Used to stay awake all night
 kisi ne use dekha nahin magar bataane waalon kii kami nahin thi ki manki main kaisaa he
 Fake News is going to do the same for all of us
 ham phek news ko lekar log raaton ko jaagenge, samudaayon ko ladate dekhenge, kisi ko peetate dekhenge balki dekh hi rahe hai
 i am giving the example of Monkey Man to make it clear that we are not practicing the practice of digesting fake news from today
 us vakt media bhi manki main ko koob cover karata tha
 There are many reports about the Monkey Man in ndtv's archive
 jise siddharth pandey, barkhaa dutt, aradhana sharma, vartika nanda ne cover kiya tha, jo tab enditivi ke saath the
 Amitabh Revi, Sera Jacob, Maya Mirchandani are still with NDTV to cover Monkey Man
 tab enditivi india nahin tha, star news tha
 We want to show the old report and the statement of the people in it so that you know what the condition of fake news or rumor is
 bich bich main iskaa trial bhi hota hi rahata he jaise spain or morokkon kii seemaa kii chamakdaar tasviir lagaakar jane anjaane main kiya gaya
 There are many such examples
 mujhe jahaan tak yaad he manki main kii pehali khabar upi ke ek hindi akhbaar main kahin kone main chhapi thi par sabit karne ke liye uski koi cliping nahin he
 First we see some old reports
 tab kii report dedh minute se zyaada lambii nahin hoti thi
 There is no need to worry about English nor do those who sing fake pride in the name of Hindi get into the trap
 manki main kii tarah phek news bhi bhesh badal kar hi aata he aapako gumraah karne ke liye
 Fantasies started flying in the air about Monkey Man
 sabane manki main ke bare main is tarah se bayaan kiya ki aap sunakar hansate hanset lotpot ho jaaenge
 But keep laughing and keep wondering whether Fake News has made such a condition for you
 manki main kaa aisa bavaal uthaa tha ki police or sarkaar bhi usamen vyast ho gai
 Sometimes the police said that it is the work of anti-social elements
 chashmadidon ke anusaar kam se kam do log hai jo milakar anjaam de rahe hai
 Tell the eyewitnesses that they do not know what Monkey Man looks like, you have heard all the different details, but on the basis of them the police started to believe that there are two people
 dilli police se us vakt ummid kii jane lagi ki wo manki main kaa potrate banaae jaise aantki hamalon ke baad aatankwaadiyon kaa banataa he
 Once the police said that he is neither a human nor a monkey, there is no other animal
 jab samaaj baura jaataa he to uskaa asar police ke kaam par padataa he
 What would the police do
 raat bhar log aatankit rahete, koi kahin se girtaa, yaa koi apni hi chaaya dekhakar manki main manki main chillane lagata
 In the end, the Delhi Police gave a reward of 50,000
 grahamantralay se rapid police force maangi gai
 Seeing the seriousness of the matter, a special team was formed whose task was to investigate the monkey man
 manki main ke samay main ham mechor nahin hue the isliye log raat bhar kud phaand karte rahete the
 We are mature at the time of fake news
 jo miltaa he chupchaap gatak jate hai or dharanaon main jeene lagate hai
 Our ability to digest fake news has improved and developed
 yah badlaav bharat main bhi aayaa he or duniya main bhi aa chukaa he
 Now, in many cases, by taking political decisions based on this, the proud voters themselves do not miss out on being proud
 hillari clinton kaa dard koi nahin samaj saktaa or na hi aap donald trump kii kushi samaj sakate hai
 One is killed by fake news and one is fake news king
 haidar ek film ai thi, iske sah lekhak the bashaarat pir
 He is a good journalist and his book is Curfew Night
 bashaarat kii bhi ek report he manki main par
 His story dated 20 June 2001 tells that the Delhi Police has uncovered the mystery of Monkey Man
 export cameti kii report main kaha gaya he ki manki main tha hi nahin
 In this story, the then Joint Commissioner Suresh Rai has said that monkey or any animal is not included in the monkey
 export cameti main National Institute of Human Behaviour (NIHB) and Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL) ke sadsy bhi the
 The police also said that Pakistan's ISI is not behind the monkey man
 na hi kisi gunda giroh kaa haath he
 Commissioner of Delhi Police Ajay Raj Sharma had even kept a reward of fifty thousand
 unhen lagata tha ki yah kisi giroh kaa kaam he
 The months of May and June of 2001 passed in Monkey Man
 police ko 379 phone kals mili the
 303 bogus originated
 70 log ghayal ho gaye the
 In one case, Raghunath Pathak of North East Delhi was killed by his brother
 log tarah tarah kii kalpana karne lage the
 The police admitted that the media's coverage added to the insanity
 aapako bataa den ki us vakt kai channelon ne manki main kii bite ke liye paanch paanch reporter kii team banaai thi
 Who used to roam in Delhi overnight
 unheen main se kai aaj prime time ke ankar hai
 It is obvious that the practice done in 2001 through Monkey Man is now working
 vaise hamaare channelon ne 2012 se pehle ke saal main yah bhi khub chalaaya ki duniya khatm hone vaali he
 Fake News may be junior in name, but Indian news people are no less senior in this work
 ganimat he ki logon ne bhi samaj liya ki sab bakawaas he
 During the note ban, the 2000 note showed the news of a chip being attached
 vaise notebandi ke kaaran antakawaad or naksalwad ke mit jane yaa ruk jane kaa daawa bhi kar diya gaya
 Demonetisation was used for the first time in the world to eradicate terrorism and Naxalism
 fark ye aayaa he ki kaala dhan ab nae noton main pakadaa ja rahaa he
 Some people are still looking for a chip in 2000 note which is not there
 jabaki usee vakt reserve bank of india ne manaa kar diya tha ki note main is tarah kaa koi chip nahin he
 At that time, four hundred fifty thousand rupees of five hundred and thousand rupees were in circulation
 ye mantri santosh gangavar kaa bayaan tha
 Till date, the Reserve Bank of India could not tell how many 500 and 1000 notes came back after demonetisation
 haal hi main sansadeey samiti ke saamne rigerv bank ke governor urjit patel nahin bataa sake ki kitna note waapas aayaa he
 He says that the counting of notes is going on
 rigerv bank ne counting mashin kharidne ke liye tender nikaala he
 The governor told the parliamentary committee in January that the next time he would appear before the committee, he would tell how many notes were returned
 kitne note waapas aae hai yah jaananaa isliye zaruri he kyonki tabhi pataa chalegaa ki kitne nakli note yaa kaala dhan cirkulation main the
 If 14
 50 lakh karod hi aae to phir notebandi kaise safal kahi jaaegi
 To this, former Finance Minister p Chidambaram has quipped that after eight months of demonetisation, if the Reserve Bank is buying a counting machine, it could have taken at least a lease
 rahul gandhi ne chutki lete hue twit kiya he ki sarkaar ko maths teacher kii zarurat he, kisi ko piemo main applai kar dena chahie
 By the way, when the bank counts and takes notes from you, you will also count it to the Reserve Bank
 jab bainkon ne notebandi ke dauraan waapas kiye gaye note tabhi ke tabhi gin liye to ab tak rigerv bank kaise nahin gin paa rahaa he
 Can the Reserve Bank not tell that the banks have given so many notes on their behalf? ham apni taraf se ek or baar gin rahe hai
 Perhaps the Monkey Man phenomenon is not yet over
 bich bich main iske nae nae item aate rahete hai or ham logon ne har baar sabit kiya he ki afvaah kisi bhi ho, yakeen zarur karenge
 We have never disappointed the spread of rumors
 tippaniyan We still remember the lesson of drinking milk of Ganesha idol in 1995
 tabhi november 2016 main desh ke kai rajyon ke log dukaanon ke aage line main lag gaye ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 In this case people from Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Hyderabad also did well with smaller cities
 whatsap se massej aayaa tha ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav kept telling the rumor and instructed the District Magistrate to take strict action against those spreading the rumor
 kitni acchhee baat he ki failaane waalon ke liye sazaa he magar afvaah par yakeen karne waalon ke liye koi sazaa nahin
 Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan also had to make a statement that there is no shortage of salt
 afvaahon kaa kya, wo udate udate mumbai pahunchi kii namak 200 rupee kilo ho gaya he
 The Mumbai Police had to tweet that it was a rumor
 kai jagahon se ye bhi khabar aa gai ki dukandaar vaaki 200 se lekar 600 rupee kilo namak bech rahe hai
 If any of you are reading this, please email so that we can know how you are feeling after looting 600 after believing in the rumor
 hyderabad police bhi is afvaah yajna ko rokane main kaaphi mehnat kar rahi thi
 We are also not disappointed with fake news because we have never disappointed fake news
 2009 main rakesh omprakash mehara ne dilli 6 banaai thi
 The film was also based on Monkey Man
 manki main kaa zikr karnaa zaruri tha
 Weaned the idol of Ganesha
 vaai tu ke ke tahat duniya ke computer ke nasht hone kaa daur bhi dekh liya, manki main bhi jhel liya or ab phek news jhel rahe hai
 i am wondering what we are going to do next
 jo bhi hoga wo phek news kaa koun sa nayaa varjan hoga jo hamen pagal banane vaala he
 The form of media in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was unprecedented
 yah chunaav bhi ped news se batch nahin sakaa tha
 Many times paid news cases are also not reported
 unke tareeke itane badal gaye hai ki pakadana bhi mushkil hota he or abhi tak ped news ko alag se paribhaashit nahin kiya gaya he or na hi iske liye sazaa kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 There were 787 cases of paid news in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 sabase adhik 223 maamle rajasthan se or 152 maamle punjab se darj hue the
 116 cases have been registered in Andhra Pradesh and 86 in Uttar Pradesh
 andhra main 116 conform cese the, lekin 2168 notice jari hue the ped news ke sambandh main
 In the 2014 election, 3100 notices were issued to candidates in the case of paid news
 ped news nahin ruk rahaa he or phek news bhi aa gaya he
 Paid news cases were also reported in the 2017 Punjab and UP assembly elections
 23 farvari 2017 ke newaloundry kii site par isaki khabar he ki goa or manipur main ped news kaa ek bhi maamla darj nahin hua tha
 We have not yet been able to free our elections from violence and booth capturing
 paise pakade jate hai magar paise kaa istemaal abhi tak nahin rukaa he
 In October 2011, the membership of UP MLA Umlesh Yadav was rejected on the charge of paid news
 rashtriya parivartan dal kii vidhayak thim
 But a large party candidate has not been dismissed while doing paid news
 is kram main ek or netaa pakade gaye hai jinka maamla adaalat main bhi sabit ho gaya he
 Narottam Mishra is the minister of Madhya Pradesh
 dilli hoicourt ke aadesh ke mutabik narottam mishra raashtrapati chunaav main matdaan nahin kar sakenge
 The Madhya Pradesh High Court has found Narottam Mishra guilty in the 2008 Assembly elections in a paid news case
 chunaav ayog ne narottam mishra par teen saal ke liye chunaav ladane par pratibandh laga diya he
 In this context, Narottam Mishra will not be a candidate in the 2018 assembly elections
 ayog ne paaya ki narottam mishra ne 2008 ke chunaav main datia vidhansabha main ped news par karch kii gai rakam ko apane karche main nahin dikhaaya he
 Narottam Mishra is currently the Minister of Water Resources, Public Relations and Parliamentary Affairs
 ped news ke maamle main doshi paye jane ke baad bhi pad par bane hue hai
 Mishra is fighting for justice
 unhone naitikta kaa lod lekar turant istipha dene kii koi jaldbaazi nahin kii he
 Be cautious about one thing
 media ko phek news kehane main khatra he
 Leaders like Trump are taking advantage of this by calling news channels as fake news
 jo phek news he use hi phek news kaha jaae
 Journalists are expected to confirm the news three or four times before printing it, but now you are also expected to confirm with many sources before you believe the news
 kahin aisa na ho jaae ki jo khabar akhbaar main padhi he use conform karne ke chakkar main offis janaa hi bhul jaaen
 Now the whatsapp group of News Housing Society has also started coming
 netaaon ke apane twitor handle hai, you tub channel hai
 What will you do if you are telling the same lie
 raajnneetik dalon ne whatsap group main mohalle tak ke logon ko gher liya he
 By creating members of the group, they continue to throw political trash, most of which is fake news
 is siries ke shuru main hamane aapako milinium bag yani vaai tu ke kaa udhaaharan diya tha, ab aapako 2001 ke dilli or uttar bharat ke kai ilaakon main faile manki main kaa udhaaharan dena chaahate hai
 The Monkey Man was neither a monkey nor a man, but the man, the Children's Children, was lost in fantasies of the Monkey Man's arrival and bite
 raat bhar jaagate the
 No one saw him but there was no shortage of people to tell him how Monkey Man is
 phek news ham sabakaa yahi haal karne vaala he
 We will wake up at night with regard to fake news, watch the communities fighting, see someone beating, rather they are watching
 manki main kaa udhaaharan isliye de rahaa hum taaki yah saaf rahe ki phek news ko pachaane kii practice ham aaj se nahin kar rahe hai
 At that time the media also covered Monkey Man very well
 enditivi ke archive main manki main ko lekar kai report hai
 Which was covered by Siddharth Pandey, Barkha Dutt, Aradhana Sharma, Vartika Nanda, who were then with NDTV
 manki main cover karne waalon main amitabh revi, sera jacob, maaya mirchandani ab bhi enditivi ke saath hai
 NDTV was not India then, it was Star News
 ham puraani report or usamen logon ke bayaan ko dikhaanaa chaahate hai taaki aapako pataa chale ki phek news yaa afvaah hamaari kya haalat karata he
 In between, it continues to be trialled as if it were unknowingly done by putting a bright picture of the border between Spain and Morocco
 aise anek udhaaharan hai
 As far as i remember, Monkey Man's first news was printed in a Hindi newspaper in UP somewhere in the corner but there is no clipping to prove it
 pehle ham kuch puraani report dekhte hai
 The report then was not longer than one and a half minutes
 angrezi se ghabaraane kii zarurat nahin he na hi hindi ke naam par nakli gaurav gaan karne waalon ke jhaanse main aane kii zarurat he
 Like monkey man, fake news also comes in disguise to mislead you
 manki main ko lekar kalpanaaen hawa main udne lageen
 Everyone said about the Monkey Man in such a way that you would laugh and laugh with laughter
 par hansate bhi rahiye or sochate bhi rahiye ki kahin phek news ne aapaki aisi haalat to nahin kar di he
 The monkey man had such a ruckus that the police and government too got busy with it
 kabhi police ne kaha ki asaamaajik tatwon kaa kaam he
 According to eyewitnesses, there are at least two people who are executing together
 bataaiye chashmadid ko yahi pataa nahin ki manki main kaisaa dikhataa he, sabake alag alag vivaran aapane sune hi magar unke aadhaar par police maanane lagi kii do log hai
 At that time it was expected from the Delhi Police that they make portraits of Monkey Man like terrorists after terror attacks
 ek baar to police ne kah diya ki na to wo insaan he na hi bandar he, koi or jaanavar he
 When society goes mad, it affects the work of the police
 police kya karti
 Throughout the night people would be terrorized, some would fall from somewhere, or some would see their own shadow and shout Monkey Man Monkey Man
 ant main haar kar dilli police ne 50,000 kaa inaam rakh diya
 Rapid Police Force was sought from the Home Ministry
 is maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue ek vishesh team bana di gai jiskaa kaam tha manki main kii jaanch karnaa
 We were not matured during Monkey Man's time, so people kept jumping all night
 phek news ke samay ham paripakv ho chuke hai
 Those found get silenced and start living in perceptions
 phek news ko pachaane kii hamaari kshamta main sudhaar bhi hua he or vikaas bhi
 This change has come in India as well as in the world
 ab log kai maamalon main iske aadhaar par raajnneetik faisle lekar khud kar garv se jaagruk matadaata bhi kehane se nahin chookte hai
 No one can understand the pain of Hillary Clinton, nor can you understand the happiness of Donald Trump
 ek phek news kaa maaraa he or ek phek news kaa badshaah he
 Haider was a film co-written by Basharat Pir
 achche patrkaar hai or inaki kitaab he karfu nite
 Basharat also has a report on Monkey Man
 20 june 2001 kii unki story bataati he ki dilli police ne manki main ke rahasy se pardaa uthaa diya he
 The report of the expert committee said that there was no monkey man
 is story main us vakt ke joint kamishnar suresh raay ne kaha he ki manki main main bandar yaa koi bhi jaanavar shaamil nahin he
 The Expert Committee also had members from the National Institute of Human Behavior (NIHB) and Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL)
 police ne yah bhi kaha ki manki main ke peeche pakistan ke iesai kaa haath nahin he
 Nor is the hand of any goon gang
 dilli police ke kamishnar ajay raaj sharma ne to pachaas hazaar kaa inaam bhi rakh diya tha
 They thought it was a gang job
 saal 2001 kaa may or june maheenaa manki main main hi biit gaya
 Police received 379 phone calls
 303 bogus nikle
 70 people were injured
 ek cese main main the uttar purv dilli ke raghunatha pathak ko unke bhai ne hi maaraa tha
 People started imagining different types
 police ne mana ki media ke kawarej ne is paagalpan ko or badha diya
 Let me tell you that at that time many channels had formed a team of five reporters for Monkey Man's Bite
 jo raat bhar dilli main ghumaa karte the
 Many of them are prime time anchors today
 zaahir he 2001 main manki main ke zariye jo practice kiya tha, wo ab kaam aa rahaa he
 By the way, in the year before 2012, our channels also ran a lot that the world was going to end
 phek news naam main bhale junior ho magar is kaam main bharat ke news vaale bhi kam senior nahin hai
 Thankfully, people also understood that all is nonsense
 notebandi ke dauraan 2000 ke note main kisi chip ke lage hone kii khabar dikhaa di gai
 As a result of demonetisation, terrorism and Naxalism were also claimed to be erased or stopped
 pehali baar aatankwaad or naksalwad ko mitaane ke liye duniya main notebandi kaa sahaara liya gaya
 The difference is that black money is now being caught in new notes
 kuch log aaj bhi 2000 ke note main chip khoj rahe hai jo he hi nahin
 At the same time, the Reserve Bank of India denied that there is no such chip in the note
 us samay paanch sau or hazaar ke saadhe chaudaa lakh karod rupee chalan main the
 This was the statement of Minister Santosh Gangwar
 aaj tak rigerv bank of india nahin bataa sakaa ki notebandi ke baad 500 or 1000 ke kitne note waapas aae
 Recently, Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel could not tell before the Parliamentary Committee how much of the note was returned
 unka kahana he ki noton kii ginati chal rahi he
 The Reserve Bank has floated a tender to purchase a counting machine
 garvanar ne janvari main sansadeey samiti se kaha tha ki agali baar jab samiti ke saamne haazir honge to bataa denge ki kitne note waapas aae
 It is important to know how many notes have come back because only then will you know how many fake notes or black money were in circulation
 agar 14
 If 50 lakh crores comes then how will the demonetisation be successful
 is par purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne chutki lete hue kaha he ki notebandi ke aath maheene baad agar reserve bank counting kii mashin kharid rahaa he to kam se kam leez par le saktaa tha
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted, tweeting that the government needs a math teacher, someone should apply to the PMO
 vaise jab aapse bank gin kar note lete hai, to rigerv bank ko bhi gin kar hi dete honge
 When banks counted the notes returned during demonetisation only then how the Reserve Bank is not able to count till now
 kya rigerv bank ye nahin bataa saktaa ki bainkon ne apni taraf se gin kar itane note diye hai
 We are counting on our side one more time
 shaayad manki main kii parighatna abhi samaapt nahin hui he
 Its new items keep coming in between and we have proved every time that whatever the rumor is, we will definitely believe it
 afvaah failaane waalon ko ham logon ne kabhi niraash nahin kiya he
 The comments 1995 main ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilane kaa lesan hamen abhi tak thik thik yaad he
 Then in November 2016, people of many states of the country got lined up in front of shops that there was going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 is maamle main dilli, kolkata, mumbai or hyderabad ke logon ne bhi chote shaharon ke saath acha pradarshan kiya tha
 The message came from whatsapp that there is going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 upi ke tatkalin mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav afvaah bataate rahe or ziladhikari ko nirdesh dene lage ki afvaah failaane waalon par sakht karrwai karen
 What a good thing that punishment is for those who spread the word, but no punishment for those who believe the rumor
 dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal or kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ko bhi bayaan dena padaa ki namak kii koi kami nahin he
 What about the rumors, that she flew to Mumbai, that the salt has reached 200 rupees a kg
 mumbai police ko twit karnaa padaa ki ye afvaah he
 It has also been reported from many places that shopkeepers are really selling 200 to 600 rupees of salt
 aapmen se koi ye pard rahe hai to pleez email kiijie taaki ham jaan saken ki afvaah par yakeen kar 600 lutaaney ke baad ab aap kaisaa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 The Hyderabad police was also working very hard to stop this rumor
 ham phek news se niraash isliye bhi nahin hote kyonki hamane kabhi bhi phek news ko niraash nahin kiya he
 Delhi 6 was created by Rakesh Omprakash Mehra in 2009
 yah film bhi manki main par aadhaarit thi
 It was necessary to mention Monkey Man
 ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilaa liya
 The world computer was also seen under Y2K, monkey man also suffered and now he is facing fake news
 main yah soch rahaa hum ki ab ham iske aage kya karne vaale hai
 Whatever will happen, what new version of fake news is going to make us mad
 ped news nahin ruk rahaa he or phek news bhi aa gaya he
 Paid news cases were also reported in the 2017 Punjab and UP assembly elections
 23 farvari 2017 ke newaloundry kii site par isaki khabar he ki goa or manipur main ped news kaa ek bhi maamla darj nahin hua tha
 We have not yet been able to free our elections from violence and booth capturing

 The Reserve Bank has floated a tender to purchase a counting machine
 garvanar ne janvari main sansadeey samiti se kaha tha ki agali baar jab samiti ke saamne haazir honge to bataa denge ki kitne note waapas aae
 It is important to know how many notes have come back because only then will you know how many fake notes or black money were in circulation
 agar 14
 If 50 lakh crores comes then how will the demonetisation be successful
 is par purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne chutki lete hue kaha he ki notebandi ke aath maheene baad agar reserve bank counting kii mashin kharid rahaa he to kam se kam leez par le saktaa tha
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted, tweeting that the government needs a math teacher, someone should apply to the PMO
 vaise jab aapse bank gin kar note lete hai, to rigerv bank ko bhi gin kar hi dete honge
 When banks counted the notes returned during demonetisation only then how the Reserve Bank is not able to count till now
 kya rigerv bank ye nahin bataa saktaa ki bainkon ne apni taraf se gin kar itane note diye hai
 We are counting on our side one more time
 shaayad manki main kii parighatna abhi samaapt nahin hui he
 Its new items keep coming in between and we have proved every time that whatever the rumor is, we will definitely believe it
 afvaah failaane waalon ko ham logon ne kabhi niraash nahin kiya he
 The comments 1995 main ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilane kaa lesan hamen abhi tak thik thik yaad he
 Then in November 2016, people of many states of the country got lined up in front of shops that there was going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 is maamle main dilli, kolkata, mumbai or hyderabad ke logon ne bhi chote shaharon ke saath acha pradarshan kiya tha
 The message came from whatsapp that there is going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 upi ke tatkalin mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav afvaah bataate rahe or ziladhikari ko nirdesh dene lage ki afvaah failaane waalon par sakht karrwai karen
 What a good thing that punishment is for those who spread the word, but no punishment for those who believe the rumor
 dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal or kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ko bhi bayaan dena padaa ki namak kii koi kami nahin he
 What about the rumors, that she flew to Mumbai, that the salt has reached 200 rupees a kg
 mumbai police ko twit karnaa padaa ki ye afvaah he
 It has also been reported from many places that shopkeepers are really selling 200 to 600 rupees of salt
 aapmen se koi ye pard rahe hai to pleez email kiijie taaki ham jaan saken ki afvaah par yakeen kar 600 lutaaney ke baad ab aap kaisaa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 The Hyderabad police was also working very hard to stop this rumor
 ham phek news se niraash isliye bhi nahin hote kyonki hamane kabhi bhi phek news ko niraash nahin kiya he
 Delhi 6 was created by Rakesh Omprakash Mehra in 2009
 yah film bhi manki main par aadhaarit thi
 It was necessary to mention Monkey Man
 ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilaa liya
 The world computer was also seen under Y2K, monkey man also suffered and now he is facing fake news
 main yah soch rahaa hum ki ab ham iske aage kya karne vaale hai
 Whatever will happen, what new version of fake news is going to make us mad
 narottam mishra madhya pradesh ke mantri hai
 According to the order of Delhi High Court, Narottam Mishra will not be able to vote in the presidential election
 madhya pradesh hai court ne narottam mishra ko 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav main ped news ke maamle main doshi paaya he
 The Election Commission has banned Narottam Mishra from contesting elections for three years
 is lihaaz se narottam mishra 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaav main ummidavaar nahin ban paayenge
 The Commission observed that Narottam Mishra did not show the amount spent on paid news in the Datia Assembly in the 2008 elections in his expenditure
 narottam mishra is vakt jal sansaadhan, jansampark or sansadeey kaary mantri hai
 He remains in office even after being found guilty in the paid news case
 mishra ji nyaay ke liye lard rahe hai
 He is in no hurry to resign immediately with a load of morality
 ek baat ko lekar satark rahiyegaa
 The media is in danger of being called fake news
 iskaa laabh trump jaise netaa uthaa hi rahe hai news channelon ko phek news kahkar
 The fake news is called fake news
 patrakaron se ummid kii jaati he ki khabar chhapane se pehle teen chaar baar pushti kar len lekin ab aapse bhi ummid kii jaati he ki khabar par yakeen karne se pehle kai sorce se conform kar len
 It should not happen that you forget to go to the office to confirm the news which you have read in the newspaper
 ab to news houseing sosayadi ke whatsap group se bhi aane laga he
 The leaders have their own tweeter handles, youtube channels
 vahi jhooth bol rahe hon to aap kya karenge
 Political parties have surrounded people up to the locality in the whatsapp group
 group kaa member banaakar siyaasi kachra thelte rahete hai jisamen se zyaadaatar phek news hi hota he
 In the beginning of this series, we gave you an example of the Millennium bug, that is, to two, now you want to give the example of Monkey Man spread in 2001 in Delhi and many areas of North India
 manki main na to manki tha na hi main tha magar main, vimen children manki main ke aane or kaat lene kii kalpanaaon main kho gaye
 Used to stay awake all night
 kisi ne use dekha nahin magar bataane waalon kii kami nahin thi ki manki main kaisaa he
 Fake News is going to do the same for all of us
 ham phek news ko lekar log raaton ko jaagenge, samudaayon ko ladate dekhenge, kisi ko peetate dekhenge balki dekh hi rahe hai
 i am giving the example of Monkey Man to make it clear that we are not practicing the practice of digesting fake news from today
 us vakt media bhi manki main ko koob cover karata tha
 There are many reports about the Monkey Man in ndtv's archive
 jise siddharth pandey, barkhaa dutt, aradhana sharma, vartika nanda ne cover kiya tha, jo tab enditivi ke saath the
 Amitabh Revi, Sera Jacob, Maya Mirchandani are still with NDTV to cover Monkey Man
 tab enditivi india nahin tha, star news tha
 We want to show the old report and the statement of the people in it so that you know what the condition of fake news or rumor is
 bich bich main iskaa trial bhi hota hi rahata he jaise spain or morokkon kii seemaa kii chamakdaar tasviir lagaakar jane anjaane main kiya gaya
 There are many such examples
 mujhe jahaan tak yaad he manki main kii pehali khabar upi ke ek hindi akhbaar main kahin kone main chhapi thi par sabit karne ke liye uski koi cliping nahin he
 First we see some old reports
 tab kii report dedh minute se zyaada lambii nahin hoti thi
 There is no need to worry about English nor do those who sing fake pride in the name of Hindi get into the trap
 manki main kii tarah phek news bhi bhesh badal kar hi aata he aapako gumraah karne ke liye
 Fantasies started flying in the air about Monkey Man
 sabane manki main ke bare main is tarah se bayaan kiya ki aap sunakar hansate hanset lotpot ho jaaenge
 But keep laughing and keep wondering whether Fake News has made such a condition for you
 manki main kaa aisa bavaal uthaa tha ki police or sarkaar bhi usamen vyast ho gai
 Sometimes the police said that it is the work of anti-social elements
 chashmadidon ke anusaar kam se kam do log hai jo milakar anjaam de rahe hai
 Tell the eyewitnesses that they do not know what Monkey Man looks like, you have heard all the different details, but on the basis of them the police started to believe that there are two people
 dilli police se us vakt ummid kii jane lagi ki wo manki main kaa potrate banaae jaise aantki hamalon ke baad aatankwaadiyon kaa banataa he
 Once the police said that he is neither a human nor a monkey, there is no other animal
 jab samaaj baura jaataa he to uskaa asar police ke kaam par padataa he
 What would the police do
 raat bhar log aatankit rahete, koi kahin se girtaa, yaa koi apni hi chaaya dekhakar manki main manki main chillane lagata
 In the end, the Delhi Police gave a reward of 50,000
 grahamantralay se rapid police force maangi gai
 Seeing the seriousness of the matter, a special team was formed whose task was to investigate the monkey man
 manki main ke samay main ham mechor nahin hue the isliye log raat bhar kud phaand karte rahete the
 We are mature at the time of fake news
 jo miltaa he chupchaap gatak jate hai or dharanaon main jeene lagate hai
 Our ability to digest fake news has improved and developed
 yah badlaav bharat main bhi aayaa he or duniya main bhi aa chukaa he
 Now, in many cases, by taking political decisions based on this, the proud voters themselves do not miss out on being proud
 hillari clinton kaa dard koi nahin samaj saktaa or na hi aap donald trump kii kushi samaj sakate hai
 One is killed by fake news and one is fake news king
 haidar ek film ai thi, iske sah lekhak the bashaarat pir
 He is a good journalist and his book is Curfew Night
 bashaarat kii bhi ek report he manki main par
 His story dated 20 June 2001 tells that the Delhi Police has uncovered the mystery of Monkey Man
 export cameti kii report main kaha gaya he ki manki main tha hi nahin
 In this story, the then Joint Commissioner Suresh Rai has said that monkey or any animal is not included in the monkey
 export cameti main National Institute of Human Behaviour (NIHB) and Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL) ke sadsy bhi the
 The police also said that Pakistan's ISI is not behind the monkey man
 na hi kisi gunda giroh kaa haath he
 Commissioner of Delhi Police Ajay Raj Sharma had even kept a reward of fifty thousand
 unhen lagata tha ki yah kisi giroh kaa kaam he
 The months of May and June of 2001 passed in Monkey Man
 police ko 379 phone kals mili the
 303 bogus originated
 70 log ghayal ho gaye the
 In one case, Raghunath Pathak of North East Delhi was killed by his brother
 log tarah tarah kii kalpana karne lage the
 The police admitted that the media's coverage added to the insanity
 aapako bataa den ki us vakt kai channelon ne manki main kii bite ke liye paanch paanch reporter kii team banaai thi
 Who used to roam in Delhi overnight
 unheen main se kai aaj prime time ke ankar hai
 It is obvious that the practice done in 2001 through Monkey Man is now working
 vaise hamaare channelon ne 2012 se pehle ke saal main yah bhi khub chalaaya ki duniya khatm hone vaali he
 Fake News may be junior in name, but Indian news people are no less senior in this work
 ganimat he ki logon ne bhi samaj liya ki sab bakawaas he
 During the note ban, the 2000 note showed the news of a chip being attached
 vaise notebandi ke kaaran antakawaad or naksalwad ke mit jane yaa ruk jane kaa daawa bhi kar diya gaya
 Demonetisation was used for the first time in the world to eradicate terrorism and Naxalism
 fark ye aayaa he ki kaala dhan ab nae noton main pakadaa ja rahaa he
 Some people are still looking for a chip in 2000 note which is not there
 jabaki usee vakt reserve bank of india ne manaa kar diya tha ki note main is tarah kaa koi chip nahin he
 At that time, four hundred fifty thousand rupees of five hundred and thousand rupees were in circulation
 ye mantri santosh gangavar kaa bayaan tha
 Till date, the Reserve Bank of India could not tell how many 500 and 1000 notes came back after demonetisation
 haal hi main sansadeey samiti ke saamne rigerv bank ke governor urjit patel nahin bataa sake ki kitna note waapas aayaa he
 He says that the counting of notes is going on
 rigerv bank ne counting mashin kharidne ke liye tender nikaala he
 The governor told the parliamentary committee in January that the next time he would appear before the committee, he would tell how many notes were returned
 kitne note waapas aae hai yah jaananaa isliye zaruri he kyonki tabhi pataa chalegaa ki kitne nakli note yaa kaala dhan cirkulation main the
 If 14
 50 lakh karod hi aae to phir notebandi kaise safal kahi jaaegi
 To this, former Finance Minister p Chidambaram has quipped that after eight months of demonetisation, if the Reserve Bank is buying a counting machine, it could have taken at least a lease
 rahul gandhi ne chutki lete hue twit kiya he ki sarkaar ko maths teacher kii zarurat he, kisi ko piemo main applai kar dena chahie
 By the way, when the bank counts and takes notes from you, you will also count it to the Reserve Bank
 jab bainkon ne notebandi ke dauraan waapas kiye gaye note tabhi ke tabhi gin liye to ab tak rigerv bank kaise nahin gin paa rahaa he
 Can the Reserve Bank not tell that the banks have given so many notes on their behalf? ham apni taraf se ek or baar gin rahe hai
 Perhaps the Monkey Man phenomenon is not yet over
 bich bich main iske nae nae item aate rahete hai or ham logon ne har baar sabit kiya he ki afvaah kisi bhi ho, yakeen zarur karenge
 We have never disappointed the spread of rumors
 tippaniyan We still remember the lesson of drinking milk of Ganesha idol in 1995
 tabhi november 2016 main desh ke kai rajyon ke log dukaanon ke aage line main lag gaye ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 In this case people from Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Hyderabad also did well with smaller cities
 whatsap se massej aayaa tha ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav kept telling the rumor and instructed the District Magistrate to take strict action against those spreading the rumor
 kitni acchhee baat he ki failaane waalon ke liye sazaa he magar afvaah par yakeen karne waalon ke liye koi sazaa nahin
 Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan also had to make a statement that there is no shortage of salt
 afvaahon kaa kya, wo udate udate mumbai pahunchi kii namak 200 rupee kilo ho gaya he
 The Mumbai Police had to tweet that it was a rumor
 kai jagahon se ye bhi khabar aa gai ki dukandaar vaaki 200 se lekar 600 rupee kilo namak bech rahe hai
 If any of you are reading this, please email so that we can know how you are feeling after looting 600 after believing in the rumor
 hyderabad police bhi is afvaah yajna ko rokane main kaaphi mehnat kar rahi thi
 We are also not disappointed with fake news because we have never disappointed fake news
 2009 main rakesh omprakash mehara ne dilli 6 banaai thi
 The film was also based on Monkey Man
 manki main kaa zikr karnaa zaruri tha
 Weaned the idol of Ganesha
 vaai tu ke ke tahat duniya ke computer ke nasht hone kaa daur bhi dekh liya, manki main bhi jhel liya or ab phek news jhel rahe hai
 i am wondering what we are going to do next
 jo bhi hoga wo phek news kaa koun sa nayaa varjan hoga jo hamen pagal banane vaala he
 Be cautious about one thing
 media ko phek news kehane main khatra he
 Leaders like Trump are taking advantage of this by calling news channels as fake news
 jo phek news he use hi phek news kaha jaae
 Journalists are expected to confirm the news three or four times before printing it, but now you are also expected to confirm with many sources before you believe the news
 kahin aisa na ho jaae ki jo khabar akhbaar main padhi he use conform karne ke chakkar main offis janaa hi bhul jaaen
 Now the whatsapp group of News Housing Society has also started coming
 netaaon ke apane twitor handle hai, you tub channel hai
 What will you do if you are telling the same lie
 raajnneetik dalon ne whatsap group main mohalle tak ke logon ko gher liya he
 By creating members of the group, they continue to throw political trash, most of which is fake news
 is siries ke shuru main hamane aapako milinium bag yani vaai tu ke kaa udhaaharan diya tha, ab aapako 2001 ke dilli or uttar bharat ke kai ilaakon main faile manki main kaa udhaaharan dena chaahate hai
 The Monkey Man was neither a monkey nor a man, but the man, the Children's Children, was lost in fantasies of the Monkey Man's arrival and bite
 raat bhar jaagate the
 No one saw him but there was no shortage of people to tell him how Monkey Man is
 phek news ham sabakaa yahi haal karne vaala he
 We will wake up at night with regard to fake news, watch the communities fighting, see someone beating, rather they are watching
 manki main kaa udhaaharan isliye de rahaa hum taaki yah saaf rahe ki phek news ko pachaane kii practice ham aaj se nahin kar rahe hai
 At that time the media also covered Monkey Man very well
 enditivi ke archive main manki main ko lekar kai report hai
 Which was covered by Siddharth Pandey, Barkha Dutt, Aradhana Sharma, Vartika Nanda, who were then with NDTV
 manki main cover karne waalon main amitabh revi, sera jacob, maaya mirchandani ab bhi enditivi ke saath hai
 NDTV was not India then, it was Star News
 ham puraani report or usamen logon ke bayaan ko dikhaanaa chaahate hai taaki aapako pataa chale ki phek news yaa afvaah hamaari kya haalat karata he
 In between, it continues to be trialled as if it were unknowingly done by putting a bright picture of the border between Spain and Morocco
 aise anek udhaaharan hai
 As far as i remember, Monkey Man's first news was printed in a Hindi newspaper in UP somewhere in the corner but there is no clipping to prove it
 pehle ham kuch puraani report dekhte hai
 The report then was not longer than one and a half minutes
 angrezi se ghabaraane kii zarurat nahin he na hi hindi ke naam par nakli gaurav gaan karne waalon ke jhaanse main aane kii zarurat he
 Like monkey man, fake news also comes in disguise to mislead you
 manki main ko lekar kalpanaaen hawa main udne lageen
 Everyone said about the Monkey Man in such a way that you would laugh and laugh with laughter
 par hansate bhi rahiye or sochate bhi rahiye ki kahin phek news ne aapaki aisi haalat to nahin kar di he
 The monkey man had such a ruckus that the police and government too got busy with it
 kabhi police ne kaha ki asaamaajik tatwon kaa kaam he
 According to eyewitnesses, there are at least two people who are executing together
 bataaiye chashmadid ko yahi pataa nahin ki manki main kaisaa dikhataa he, sabake alag alag vivaran aapane sune hi magar unke aadhaar par police maanane lagi kii do log hai
 At that time it was expected from the Delhi Police that they make portraits of Monkey Man like terrorists after terror attacks
 ek baar to police ne kah diya ki na to wo insaan he na hi bandar he, koi or jaanavar he
 When society goes mad, it affects the work of the police
 police kya karti
 Throughout the night people would be terrorized, some would fall from somewhere, or some would see their own shadow and shout Monkey Man Monkey Man
 ant main haar kar dilli police ne 50,000 kaa inaam rakh diya
 Rapid Police Force was sought from the Home Ministry
 is maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue ek vishesh team bana di gai jiskaa kaam tha manki main kii jaanch karnaa
 We were not matured during Monkey Man's time, so people kept jumping all night
 phek news ke samay ham paripakv ho chuke hai
 Those found get silenced and start living in perceptions
 phek news ko pachaane kii hamaari kshamta main sudhaar bhi hua he or vikaas bhi
 This change has come in India as well as in the world
 ab log kai maamalon main iske aadhaar par raajnneetik faisle lekar khud kar garv se jaagruk matadaata bhi kehane se nahin chookte hai
 No one can understand the pain of Hillary Clinton, nor can you understand the happiness of Donald Trump
 ek phek news kaa maaraa he or ek phek news kaa badshaah he
 Haider was a film co-written by Basharat Pir
 achche patrkaar hai or inaki kitaab he karfu nite
 Basharat also has a report on Monkey Man
 20 june 2001 kii unki story bataati he ki dilli police ne manki main ke rahasy se pardaa uthaa diya he
 The report of the expert committee said that there was no monkey man
 is story main us vakt ke joint kamishnar suresh raay ne kaha he ki manki main main bandar yaa koi bhi jaanavar shaamil nahin he
 The Expert Committee also had members from the National Institute of Human Behavior (NIHB) and Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL)
 police ne yah bhi kaha ki manki main ke peeche pakistan ke iesai kaa haath nahin he
 Nor is the hand of any goon gang
 dilli police ke kamishnar ajay raaj sharma ne to pachaas hazaar kaa inaam bhi rakh diya tha
 They thought it was a gang job
 saal 2001 kaa may or june maheenaa manki main main hi biit gaya
 Police received 379 phone calls
 303 bogus nikle
 70 people were injured
 ek cese main main the uttar purv dilli ke raghunatha pathak ko unke bhai ne hi maaraa tha
 People started imagining different types
 police ne mana ki media ke kawarej ne is paagalpan ko or badha diya
 Let me tell you that at that time many channels had formed a team of five reporters for Monkey Man's Bite
 jo raat bhar dilli main ghumaa karte the
 Many of them are prime time anchors today
 zaahir he 2001 main manki main ke zariye jo practice kiya tha, wo ab kaam aa rahaa he
 By the way, in the year before 2012, our channels also ran a lot that the world was going to end
 phek news naam main bhale junior ho magar is kaam main bharat ke news vaale bhi kam senior nahin hai
 Thankfully, people also understood that all is nonsense
 notebandi ke dauraan 2000 ke note main kisi chip ke lage hone kii khabar dikhaa di gai
 As a result of demonetisation, terrorism and Naxalism were also claimed to be erased or stopped
 pehali baar aatankwaad or naksalwad ko mitaane ke liye duniya main notebandi kaa sahaara liya gaya
 The difference is that black money is now being caught in new notes
 kuch log aaj bhi 2000 ke note main chip khoj rahe hai jo he hi nahin
 At the same time, the Reserve Bank of India denied that there is no such chip in the note
 us samay paanch sau or hazaar ke saadhe chaudaa lakh karod rupee chalan main the
 This was the statement of Minister Santosh Gangwar
 aaj tak rigerv bank of india nahin bataa sakaa ki notebandi ke baad 500 or 1000 ke kitne note waapas aae
 Recently, Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel could not tell before the Parliamentary Committee how much of the note was returned
 unka kahana he ki noton kii ginati chal rahi he
 The Reserve Bank has floated a tender to purchase a counting machine
 garvanar ne janvari main sansadeey samiti se kaha tha ki agali baar jab samiti ke saamne haazir honge to bataa denge ki kitne note waapas aae
 It is important to know how many notes have come back because only then will you know how many fake notes or black money were in circulation
 agar 14
 If 50 lakh crores comes then how will the demonetisation be successful
 is par purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne chutki lete hue kaha he ki notebandi ke aath maheene baad agar reserve bank counting kii mashin kharid rahaa he to kam se kam leez par le saktaa tha
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted, tweeting that the government needs a math teacher, someone should apply to the PMO
 vaise jab aapse bank gin kar note lete hai, to rigerv bank ko bhi gin kar hi dete honge
 When banks counted the notes returned during demonetisation only then how the Reserve Bank is not able to count till now
 kya rigerv bank ye nahin bataa saktaa ki bainkon ne apni taraf se gin kar itane note diye hai
 We are counting on our side one more time
 shaayad manki main kii parighatna abhi samaapt nahin hui he
 Its new items keep coming in between and we have proved every time that whatever the rumor is, we will definitely believe it
 afvaah failaane waalon ko ham logon ne kabhi niraash nahin kiya he
 The comments 1995 main ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilane kaa lesan hamen abhi tak thik thik yaad he
 Then in November 2016, people of many states of the country got lined up in front of shops that there was going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 is maamle main dilli, kolkata, mumbai or hyderabad ke logon ne bhi chote shaharon ke saath acha pradarshan kiya tha
 The message came from whatsapp that there is going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 upi ke tatkalin mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav afvaah bataate rahe or ziladhikari ko nirdesh dene lage ki afvaah failaane waalon par sakht karrwai karen
 What a good thing that punishment is for those who spread the word, but no punishment for those who believe the rumor
 dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal or kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ko bhi bayaan dena padaa ki namak kii koi kami nahin he
 What about the rumors, that she flew to Mumbai, that the salt has reached 200 rupees a kg
 mumbai police ko twit karnaa padaa ki ye afvaah he
 It has also been reported from many places that shopkeepers are really selling 200 to 600 rupees of salt
 aapmen se koi ye pard rahe hai to pleez email kiijie taaki ham jaan saken ki afvaah par yakeen kar 600 lutaaney ke baad ab aap kaisaa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 The Hyderabad police was also working very hard to stop this rumor
 ham phek news se niraash isliye bhi nahin hote kyonki hamane kabhi bhi phek news ko niraash nahin kiya he

 haidar ek film ai thi, iske sah lekhak the bashaarat pir
 He is a good journalist and his book is Curfew Night
 bashaarat kii bhi ek report he manki main par
 His story dated 20 June 2001 tells that the Delhi Police has uncovered the mystery of Monkey Man
 export cameti kii report main kaha gaya he ki manki main tha hi nahin
 In this story, the then Joint Commissioner Suresh Rai has said that monkey or any animal is not included in the monkey
 export cameti main National Institute of Human Behaviour (NIHB) and Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL) ke sadsy bhi the
 The police also said that Pakistan's ISI is not behind the monkey man
 na hi kisi gunda giroh kaa haath he
 Commissioner of Delhi Police Ajay Raj Sharma had even kept a reward of fifty thousand
 unhen lagata tha ki yah kisi giroh kaa kaam he
 The months of May and June of 2001 passed in Monkey Man
 police ko 379 phone kals mili the
 303 bogus originated
 70 log ghayal ho gaye the
 In one case, Raghunath Pathak of North East Delhi was killed by his brother
 log tarah tarah kii kalpana karne lage the
 The police admitted that the media's coverage added to the insanity
 aapako bataa den ki us vakt kai channelon ne manki main kii bite ke liye paanch paanch reporter kii team banaai thi
 Who used to roam in Delhi overnight
 unheen main se kai aaj prime time ke ankar hai
 It is obvious that the practice done in 2001 through Monkey Man is now working
 vaise hamaare channelon ne 2012 se pehle ke saal main yah bhi khub chalaaya ki duniya khatm hone vaali he
 Fake News may be junior in name, but Indian news people are no less senior in this work
 ganimat he ki logon ne bhi samaj liya ki sab bakawaas he
 During the note ban, the 2000 note showed the news of a chip being attached
 vaise notebandi ke kaaran antakawaad or naksalwad ke mit jane yaa ruk jane kaa daawa bhi kar diya gaya
 Demonetisation was used for the first time in the world to eradicate terrorism and Naxalism
 fark ye aayaa he ki kaala dhan ab nae noton main pakadaa ja rahaa he
 Some people are still looking for a chip in 2000 note which is not there
 jabaki usee vakt reserve bank of india ne manaa kar diya tha ki note main is tarah kaa koi chip nahin he
 At that time, four hundred fifty thousand rupees of five hundred and thousand rupees were in circulation
 ye mantri santosh gangavar kaa bayaan tha
 Till date, the Reserve Bank of India could not tell how many 500 and 1000 notes came back after demonetisation
 haal hi main sansadeey samiti ke saamne rigerv bank ke governor urjit patel nahin bataa sake ki kitna note waapas aayaa he
 He says that the counting of notes is going on
 rigerv bank ne counting mashin kharidne ke liye tender nikaala he
 The governor told the parliamentary committee in January that the next time he would appear before the committee, he would tell how many notes were returned
 kitne note waapas aae hai yah jaananaa isliye zaruri he kyonki tabhi pataa chalegaa ki kitne nakli note yaa kaala dhan cirkulation main the
 If 14
 50 lakh karod hi aae to phir notebandi kaise safal kahi jaaegi
 To this, former Finance Minister p Chidambaram has quipped that after eight months of demonetisation, if the Reserve Bank is buying a counting machine, it could have taken at least a lease
 rahul gandhi ne chutki lete hue twit kiya he ki sarkaar ko maths teacher kii zarurat he, kisi ko piemo main applai kar dena chahie
 By the way, when the bank counts and takes notes from you, you will also count it to the Reserve Bank
 jab bainkon ne notebandi ke dauraan waapas kiye gaye note tabhi ke tabhi gin liye to ab tak rigerv bank kaise nahin gin paa rahaa he
 Can the Reserve Bank not tell that the banks have given so many notes on their behalf? ham apni taraf se ek or baar gin rahe hai
 Perhaps the Monkey Man phenomenon is not yet over
 bich bich main iske nae nae item aate rahete hai or ham logon ne har baar sabit kiya he ki afvaah kisi bhi ho, yakeen zarur karenge
 We have never disappointed the spread of rumors
 tippaniyan We still remember the lesson of drinking milk of Ganesha idol in 1995
 tabhi november 2016 main desh ke kai rajyon ke log dukaanon ke aage line main lag gaye ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 In this case people from Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Hyderabad also did well with smaller cities
 whatsap se massej aayaa tha ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav kept telling the rumor and instructed the District Magistrate to take strict action against those spreading the rumor
 kitni acchhee baat he ki failaane waalon ke liye sazaa he magar afvaah par yakeen karne waalon ke liye koi sazaa nahin
 Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan also had to make a statement that there is no shortage of salt
 afvaahon kaa kya, wo udate udate mumbai pahunchi kii namak 200 rupee kilo ho gaya he
 The Mumbai Police had to tweet that it was a rumor
 kai jagahon se ye bhi khabar aa gai ki dukandaar vaaki 200 se lekar 600 rupee kilo namak bech rahe hai
 If any of you are reading this, please email so that we can know how you are feeling after looting 600 after believing in the rumor
 hyderabad police bhi is afvaah yajna ko rokane main kaaphi mehnat kar rahi thi
 We are also not disappointed with fake news because we have never disappointed fake news
 2009 main rakesh omprakash mehara ne dilli 6 banaai thi
 The film was also based on Monkey Man
 manki main kaa zikr karnaa zaruri tha
 Weaned the idol of Ganesha
 vaai tu ke ke tahat duniya ke computer ke nasht hone kaa daur bhi dekh liya, manki main bhi jhel liya or ab phek news jhel rahe hai
 i am wondering what we are going to do next
 jo bhi hoga wo phek news kaa koun sa nayaa varjan hoga jo hamen pagal banane vaala he
 At that time the media also covered Monkey Man very well
 enditivi ke archive main manki main ko lekar kai report hai
 Which was covered by Siddharth Pandey, Barkha Dutt, Aradhana Sharma, Vartika Nanda, who were then with NDTV
 manki main cover karne waalon main amitabh revi, sera jacob, maaya mirchandani ab bhi enditivi ke saath hai
 NDTV was not India then, it was Star News
 ham puraani report or usamen logon ke bayaan ko dikhaanaa chaahate hai taaki aapako pataa chale ki phek news yaa afvaah hamaari kya haalat karata he
 In between, it continues to be trialled as if it were unknowingly done by putting a bright picture of the border between Spain and Morocco
 aise anek udhaaharan hai
 As far as i remember, Monkey Man's first news was printed in a Hindi newspaper in UP somewhere in the corner but there is no clipping to prove it
 pehle ham kuch puraani report dekhte hai
 The report then was not longer than one and a half minutes
 angrezi se ghabaraane kii zarurat nahin he na hi hindi ke naam par nakli gaurav gaan karne waalon ke jhaanse main aane kii zarurat he
 Like monkey man, fake news also comes in disguise to mislead you
 manki main ko lekar kalpanaaen hawa main udne lageen
 Everyone said about the Monkey Man in such a way that you would laugh and laugh with laughter
 par hansate bhi rahiye or sochate bhi rahiye ki kahin phek news ne aapaki aisi haalat to nahin kar di he
 The monkey man had such a ruckus that the police and government too got busy with it
 kabhi police ne kaha ki asaamaajik tatwon kaa kaam he
 According to eyewitnesses, there are at least two people who are executing together
 bataaiye chashmadid ko yahi pataa nahin ki manki main kaisaa dikhataa he, sabake alag alag vivaran aapane sune hi magar unke aadhaar par police maanane lagi kii do log hai
 At that time it was expected from the Delhi Police that they make portraits of Monkey Man like terrorists after terror attacks
 ek baar to police ne kah diya ki na to wo insaan he na hi bandar he, koi or jaanavar he
 When society goes mad, it affects the work of the police
 police kya karti
 Throughout the night people would be terrorized, some would fall from somewhere, or some would see their own shadow and shout Monkey Man Monkey Man
 ant main haar kar dilli police ne 50,000 kaa inaam rakh diya
 Rapid Police Force was sought from the Home Ministry
 is maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue ek vishesh team bana di gai jiskaa kaam tha manki main kii jaanch karnaa
 We were not matured during Monkey Man's time, so people kept jumping all night
 phek news ke samay ham paripakv ho chuke hai
 Those found get silenced and start living in perceptions
 phek news ko pachaane kii hamaari kshamta main sudhaar bhi hua he or vikaas bhi
 This change has come in India as well as in the world
 ab log kai maamalon main iske aadhaar par raajnneetik faisle lekar khud kar garv se jaagruk matadaata bhi kehane se nahin chookte hai
 No one can understand the pain of Hillary Clinton, nor can you understand the happiness of Donald Trump
 ek phek news kaa maaraa he or ek phek news kaa badshaah he
 Haider was a film co-written by Basharat Pir
 achche patrkaar hai or inaki kitaab he karfu nite
 Basharat also has a report on Monkey Man
 20 june 2001 kii unki story bataati he ki dilli police ne manki main ke rahasy se pardaa uthaa diya he
 The report of the expert committee said that there was no monkey man
 is story main us vakt ke joint kamishnar suresh raay ne kaha he ki manki main main bandar yaa koi bhi jaanavar shaamil nahin he
 The Expert Committee also had members from the National Institute of Human Behavior (NIHB) and Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL)
 police ne yah bhi kaha ki manki main ke peeche pakistan ke iesai kaa haath nahin he
 Nor is the hand of any goon gang
 dilli police ke kamishnar ajay raaj sharma ne to pachaas hazaar kaa inaam bhi rakh diya tha
 They thought it was a gang job
 saal 2001 kaa may or june maheenaa manki main main hi biit gaya
 Police received 379 phone calls
 303 bogus nikle
 70 people were injured
 ek cese main main the uttar purv dilli ke raghunatha pathak ko unke bhai ne hi maaraa tha
 People started imagining different types
 police ne mana ki media ke kawarej ne is paagalpan ko or badha diya
 Let me tell you that at that time many channels had formed a team of five reporters for Monkey Man's Bite
 jo raat bhar dilli main ghumaa karte the
 Many of them are prime time anchors today
 zaahir he 2001 main manki main ke zariye jo practice kiya tha, wo ab kaam aa rahaa he
 By the way, in the year before 2012, our channels also ran a lot that the world was going to end
 phek news naam main bhale junior ho magar is kaam main bharat ke news vaale bhi kam senior nahin hai
 Thankfully, people also understood that all is nonsense
 notebandi ke dauraan 2000 ke note main kisi chip ke lage hone kii khabar dikhaa di gai
 As a result of demonetisation, terrorism and Naxalism were also claimed to be erased or stopped
 pehali baar aatankwaad or naksalwad ko mitaane ke liye duniya main notebandi kaa sahaara liya gaya
 The difference is that black money is now being caught in new notes
 kuch log aaj bhi 2000 ke note main chip khoj rahe hai jo he hi nahin
 At the same time, the Reserve Bank of India denied that there is no such chip in the note
 us samay paanch sau or hazaar ke saadhe chaudaa lakh karod rupee chalan main the
 This was the statement of Minister Santosh Gangwar
 aaj tak rigerv bank of india nahin bataa sakaa ki notebandi ke baad 500 or 1000 ke kitne note waapas aae
 Recently, Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel could not tell before the Parliamentary Committee how much of the note was returned
 unka kahana he ki noton kii ginati chal rahi he
 The Reserve Bank has floated a tender to purchase a counting machine
 garvanar ne janvari main sansadeey samiti se kaha tha ki agali baar jab samiti ke saamne haazir honge to bataa denge ki kitne note waapas aae
 It is important to know how many notes have come back because only then will you know how many fake notes or black money were in circulation
 agar 14
 If 50 lakh crores comes then how will the demonetisation be successful
 is par purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne chutki lete hue kaha he ki notebandi ke aath maheene baad agar reserve bank counting kii mashin kharid rahaa he to kam se kam leez par le saktaa tha
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted, tweeting that the government needs a math teacher, someone should apply to the PMO
 vaise jab aapse bank gin kar note lete hai, to rigerv bank ko bhi gin kar hi dete honge
 When banks counted the notes returned during demonetisation only then how the Reserve Bank is not able to count till now
 kya rigerv bank ye nahin bataa saktaa ki bainkon ne apni taraf se gin kar itane note diye hai
 We are counting on our side one more time
 shaayad manki main kii parighatna abhi samaapt nahin hui he
 Its new items keep coming in between and we have proved every time that whatever the rumor is, we will definitely believe it
 afvaah failaane waalon ko ham logon ne kabhi niraash nahin kiya he
 The comments 1995 main ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilane kaa lesan hamen abhi tak thik thik yaad he
 Then in November 2016, people of many states of the country got lined up in front of shops that there was going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 is maamle main dilli, kolkata, mumbai or hyderabad ke logon ne bhi chote shaharon ke saath acha pradarshan kiya tha
 The message came from whatsapp that there is going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 upi ke tatkalin mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav afvaah bataate rahe or ziladhikari ko nirdesh dene lage ki afvaah failaane waalon par sakht karrwai karen
 What a good thing that punishment is for those who spread the word, but no punishment for those who believe the rumor
 dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal or kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ko bhi bayaan dena padaa ki namak kii koi kami nahin he
 What about the rumors, that she flew to Mumbai, that the salt has reached 200 rupees a kg
 mumbai police ko twit karnaa padaa ki ye afvaah he
 It has also been reported from many places that shopkeepers are really selling 200 to 600 rupees of salt
 aapmen se koi ye pard rahe hai to pleez email kiijie taaki ham jaan saken ki afvaah par yakeen kar 600 lutaaney ke baad ab aap kaisaa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 The Hyderabad police was also working very hard to stop this rumor
 ham phek news se niraash isliye bhi nahin hote kyonki hamane kabhi bhi phek news ko niraash nahin kiya he
 Delhi 6 was created by Rakesh Omprakash Mehra in 2009
 yah film bhi manki main par aadhaarit thi
 It was necessary to mention Monkey Man
 ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilaa liya
 The world computer was also seen under Y2K, monkey man also suffered and now he is facing fake news
 main yah soch rahaa hum ki ab ham iske aage kya karne vaale hai
 Whatever will happen, what new version of fake news is going to make us mad
 manki main kii tarah phek news bhi bhesh badal kar hi aata he aapako gumraah karne ke liye
 Fantasies started flying in the air about Monkey Man
 sabane manki main ke bare main is tarah se bayaan kiya ki aap sunakar hansate hanset lotpot ho jaaenge
 But keep laughing and keep wondering whether Fake News has made such a condition for you
 manki main kaa aisa bavaal uthaa tha ki police or sarkaar bhi usamen vyast ho gai
 Sometimes the police said that it is the work of anti-social elements
 chashmadidon ke anusaar kam se kam do log hai jo milakar anjaam de rahe hai
 Tell the eyewitnesses that they do not know what Monkey Man looks like, you have heard all the different details, but on the basis of them the police started to believe that there are two people
 dilli police se us vakt ummid kii jane lagi ki wo manki main kaa potrate banaae jaise aantki hamalon ke baad aatankwaadiyon kaa banataa he
 Once the police said that he is neither a human nor a monkey, there is no other animal
 jab samaaj baura jaataa he to uskaa asar police ke kaam par padataa he
 What would the police do
 raat bhar log aatankit rahete, koi kahin se girtaa, yaa koi apni hi chaaya dekhakar manki main manki main chillane lagata
 In the end, the Delhi Police gave a reward of 50,000
 grahamantralay se rapid police force maangi gai
 Seeing the seriousness of the matter, a special team was formed whose task was to investigate the monkey man
 manki main ke samay main ham mechor nahin hue the isliye log raat bhar kud phaand karte rahete the
 We are mature at the time of fake news
 jo miltaa he chupchaap gatak jate hai or dharanaon main jeene lagate hai
 Our ability to digest fake news has improved and developed
 yah badlaav bharat main bhi aayaa he or duniya main bhi aa chukaa he
 Now, in many cases, by taking political decisions based on this, the proud voters themselves do not miss out on being proud
 hillari clinton kaa dard koi nahin samaj saktaa or na hi aap donald trump kii kushi samaj sakate hai

 upi ke tatkalin mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav afvaah bataate rahe or ziladhikari ko nirdesh dene lage ki afvaah failaane waalon par sakht karrwai karen
 What a good thing that punishment is for those who spread the word, but no punishment for those who believe the rumor
 dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal or kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ko bhi bayaan dena padaa ki namak kii koi kami nahin he
 What about the rumors, that she flew to Mumbai, that the salt has reached 200 rupees a kg
 mumbai police ko twit karnaa padaa ki ye afvaah he
 It has also been reported from many places that shopkeepers are really selling 200 to 600 rupees of salt
 aapmen se koi ye pard rahe hai to pleez email kiijie taaki ham jaan saken ki afvaah par yakeen kar 600 lutaaney ke baad ab aap kaisaa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 The Hyderabad police was also working very hard to stop this rumor
 ham phek news se niraash isliye bhi nahin hote kyonki hamane kabhi bhi phek news ko niraash nahin kiya he
 Delhi 6 was created by Rakesh Omprakash Mehra in 2009
 yah film bhi manki main par aadhaarit thi
 It was necessary to mention Monkey Man
 ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilaa liya
 The world computer was also seen under Y2K, monkey man also suffered and now he is facing fake news
 main yah soch rahaa hum ki ab ham iske aage kya karne vaale hai
 Whatever will happen, what new version of fake news is going to make us mad
 jab samaaj baura jaataa he to uskaa asar police ke kaam par padataa he
 What would the police do
 raat bhar log aatankit rahete, koi kahin se girtaa, yaa koi apni hi chaaya dekhakar manki main manki main chillane lagata
 In the end, the Delhi Police gave a reward of 50,000
 grahamantralay se rapid police force maangi gai
 Seeing the seriousness of the matter, a special team was formed whose task was to investigate the monkey man
 manki main ke samay main ham mechor nahin hue the isliye log raat bhar kud phaand karte rahete the
 We are mature at the time of fake news
 jo miltaa he chupchaap gatak jate hai or dharanaon main jeene lagate hai
 Our ability to digest fake news has improved and developed
 yah badlaav bharat main bhi aayaa he or duniya main bhi aa chukaa he
 Now, in many cases, by taking political decisions based on this, the proud voters themselves do not miss out on being proud
 hillari clinton kaa dard koi nahin samaj saktaa or na hi aap donald trump kii kushi samaj sakate hai
 One is killed by fake news and one is fake news king
 haidar ek film ai thi, iske sah lekhak the bashaarat pir
 He is a good journalist and his book is Curfew Night
 bashaarat kii bhi ek report he manki main par
 His story dated 20 June 2001 tells that the Delhi Police has uncovered the mystery of Monkey Man
 export cameti kii report main kaha gaya he ki manki main tha hi nahin
 In this story, the then Joint Commissioner Suresh Rai has said that monkey or any animal is not included in the monkey
 export cameti main National Institute of Human Behaviour (NIHB) and Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL) ke sadsy bhi the
 The police also said that Pakistan's ISI is not behind the monkey man
 na hi kisi gunda giroh kaa haath he
 Commissioner of Delhi Police Ajay Raj Sharma had even kept a reward of fifty thousand
 unhen lagata tha ki yah kisi giroh kaa kaam he
 The months of May and June of 2001 passed in Monkey Man
 police ko 379 phone kals mili the
 303 bogus originated
 70 log ghayal ho gaye the
 In one case, Raghunath Pathak of North East Delhi was killed by his brother
 log tarah tarah kii kalpana karne lage the
 The police admitted that the media's coverage added to the insanity
 aapako bataa den ki us vakt kai channelon ne manki main kii bite ke liye paanch paanch reporter kii team banaai thi
 Who used to roam in Delhi overnight
 unheen main se kai aaj prime time ke ankar hai
 It is obvious that the practice done in 2001 through Monkey Man is now working
 vaise hamaare channelon ne 2012 se pehle ke saal main yah bhi khub chalaaya ki duniya khatm hone vaali he
 Fake News may be junior in name, but Indian news people are no less senior in this work
 ganimat he ki logon ne bhi samaj liya ki sab bakawaas he
 During the note ban, the 2000 note showed the news of a chip being attached
 vaise notebandi ke kaaran antakawaad or naksalwad ke mit jane yaa ruk jane kaa daawa bhi kar diya gaya
 Demonetisation was used for the first time in the world to eradicate terrorism and Naxalism
 fark ye aayaa he ki kaala dhan ab nae noton main pakadaa ja rahaa he
 Some people are still looking for a chip in 2000 note which is not there
 jabaki usee vakt reserve bank of india ne manaa kar diya tha ki note main is tarah kaa koi chip nahin he
 At that time, four hundred fifty thousand rupees of five hundred and thousand rupees were in circulation
 ye mantri santosh gangavar kaa bayaan tha
 Till date, the Reserve Bank of India could not tell how many 500 and 1000 notes came back after demonetisation
 haal hi main sansadeey samiti ke saamne rigerv bank ke governor urjit patel nahin bataa sake ki kitna note waapas aayaa he
 He says that the counting of notes is going on
 rigerv bank ne counting mashin kharidne ke liye tender nikaala he
 The governor told the parliamentary committee in January that the next time he would appear before the committee, he would tell how many notes were returned
 kitne note waapas aae hai yah jaananaa isliye zaruri he kyonki tabhi pataa chalegaa ki kitne nakli note yaa kaala dhan cirkulation main the
 If 14
 50 lakh karod hi aae to phir notebandi kaise safal kahi jaaegi
 To this, former Finance Minister p Chidambaram has quipped that after eight months of demonetisation, if the Reserve Bank is buying a counting machine, it could have taken at least a lease
 rahul gandhi ne chutki lete hue twit kiya he ki sarkaar ko maths teacher kii zarurat he, kisi ko piemo main applai kar dena chahie
 By the way, when the bank counts and takes notes from you, you will also count it to the Reserve Bank
 jab bainkon ne notebandi ke dauraan waapas kiye gaye note tabhi ke tabhi gin liye to ab tak rigerv bank kaise nahin gin paa rahaa he
 Can the Reserve Bank not tell that the banks have given so many notes on their behalf? ham apni taraf se ek or baar gin rahe hai
 Perhaps the Monkey Man phenomenon is not yet over
 bich bich main iske nae nae item aate rahete hai or ham logon ne har baar sabit kiya he ki afvaah kisi bhi ho, yakeen zarur karenge
 We have never disappointed the spread of rumors
 tippaniyan We still remember the lesson of drinking milk of Ganesha idol in 1995
 tabhi november 2016 main desh ke kai rajyon ke log dukaanon ke aage line main lag gaye ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 In this case people from Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Hyderabad also did well with smaller cities
 whatsap se massej aayaa tha ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav kept telling the rumor and instructed the District Magistrate to take strict action against those spreading the rumor
 kitni acchhee baat he ki failaane waalon ke liye sazaa he magar afvaah par yakeen karne waalon ke liye koi sazaa nahin
 Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan also had to make a statement that there is no shortage of salt
 afvaahon kaa kya, wo udate udate mumbai pahunchi kii namak 200 rupee kilo ho gaya he
 The Mumbai Police had to tweet that it was a rumor
 kai jagahon se ye bhi khabar aa gai ki dukandaar vaaki 200 se lekar 600 rupee kilo namak bech rahe hai
 If any of you are reading this, please email so that we can know how you are feeling after looting 600 after believing in the rumor
 hyderabad police bhi is afvaah yajna ko rokane main kaaphi mehnat kar rahi thi
 We are also not disappointed with fake news because we have never disappointed fake news
 2009 main rakesh omprakash mehara ne dilli 6 banaai thi
 The film was also based on Monkey Man
 manki main kaa zikr karnaa zaruri tha
 Weaned the idol of Ganesha
 vaai tu ke ke tahat duniya ke computer ke nasht hone kaa daur bhi dekh liya, manki main bhi jhel liya or ab phek news jhel rahe hai
 i am wondering what we are going to do next
 jo bhi hoga wo phek news kaa koun sa nayaa varjan hoga jo hamen pagal banane vaala he
 We were not matured during Monkey Man's time, so people kept jumping all night
 phek news ke samay ham paripakv ho chuke hai
 Those found get silenced and start living in perceptions
 phek news ko pachaane kii hamaari kshamta main sudhaar bhi hua he or vikaas bhi
 This change has come in India as well as in the world
 ab log kai maamalon main iske aadhaar par raajnneetik faisle lekar khud kar garv se jaagruk matadaata bhi kehane se nahin chookte hai
 No one can understand the pain of Hillary Clinton, nor can you understand the happiness of Donald Trump
 ek phek news kaa maaraa he or ek phek news kaa badshaah he
 Haider was a film co-written by Basharat Pir
 achche patrkaar hai or inaki kitaab he karfu nite
 Basharat also has a report on Monkey Man
 20 june 2001 kii unki story bataati he ki dilli police ne manki main ke rahasy se pardaa uthaa diya he
 The report of the expert committee said that there was no monkey man
 is story main us vakt ke joint kamishnar suresh raay ne kaha he ki manki main main bandar yaa koi bhi jaanavar shaamil nahin he
 The Expert Committee also had members from the National Institute of Human Behavior (NIHB) and Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL)
 police ne yah bhi kaha ki manki main ke peeche pakistan ke iesai kaa haath nahin he
 Nor is the hand of any goon gang
 dilli police ke kamishnar ajay raaj sharma ne to pachaas hazaar kaa inaam bhi rakh diya tha
 They thought it was a gang job
 saal 2001 kaa may or june maheenaa manki main main hi biit gaya
 Police received 379 phone calls
 303 bogus nikle
 70 people were injured
 ek cese main main the uttar purv dilli ke raghunatha pathak ko unke bhai ne hi maaraa tha
 People started imagining different types
 police ne mana ki media ke kawarej ne is paagalpan ko or badha diya
 Let me tell you that at that time many channels had formed a team of five reporters for Monkey Man's Bite
 jo raat bhar dilli main ghumaa karte the
 Many of them are prime time anchors today
 zaahir he 2001 main manki main ke zariye jo practice kiya tha, wo ab kaam aa rahaa he
 By the way, in the year before 2012, our channels also ran a lot that the world was going to end
 phek news naam main bhale junior ho magar is kaam main bharat ke news vaale bhi kam senior nahin hai
 Thankfully, people also understood that all is nonsense
 notebandi ke dauraan 2000 ke note main kisi chip ke lage hone kii khabar dikhaa di gai
 As a result of demonetisation, terrorism and Naxalism were also claimed to be erased or stopped
 pehali baar aatankwaad or naksalwad ko mitaane ke liye duniya main notebandi kaa sahaara liya gaya
 The difference is that black money is now being caught in new notes
 kuch log aaj bhi 2000 ke note main chip khoj rahe hai jo he hi nahin
 At the same time, the Reserve Bank of India denied that there is no such chip in the note
 us samay paanch sau or hazaar ke saadhe chaudaa lakh karod rupee chalan main the
 This was the statement of Minister Santosh Gangwar
 aaj tak rigerv bank of india nahin bataa sakaa ki notebandi ke baad 500 or 1000 ke kitne note waapas aae
 Recently, Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel could not tell before the Parliamentary Committee how much of the note was returned
 unka kahana he ki noton kii ginati chal rahi he
 The Reserve Bank has floated a tender to purchase a counting machine
 garvanar ne janvari main sansadeey samiti se kaha tha ki agali baar jab samiti ke saamne haazir honge to bataa denge ki kitne note waapas aae
 It is important to know how many notes have come back because only then will you know how many fake notes or black money were in circulation
 agar 14
 If 50 lakh crores comes then how will the demonetisation be successful
 is par purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne chutki lete hue kaha he ki notebandi ke aath maheene baad agar reserve bank counting kii mashin kharid rahaa he to kam se kam leez par le saktaa tha
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted, tweeting that the government needs a math teacher, someone should apply to the PMO
 vaise jab aapse bank gin kar note lete hai, to rigerv bank ko bhi gin kar hi dete honge
 When banks counted the notes returned during demonetisation only then how the Reserve Bank is not able to count till now
 kya rigerv bank ye nahin bataa saktaa ki bainkon ne apni taraf se gin kar itane note diye hai
 We are counting on our side one more time
 shaayad manki main kii parighatna abhi samaapt nahin hui he
 Its new items keep coming in between and we have proved every time that whatever the rumor is, we will definitely believe it
 afvaah failaane waalon ko ham logon ne kabhi niraash nahin kiya he
 The comments 1995 main ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilane kaa lesan hamen abhi tak thik thik yaad he
 Then in November 2016, people of many states of the country got lined up in front of shops that there was going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 is maamle main dilli, kolkata, mumbai or hyderabad ke logon ne bhi chote shaharon ke saath acha pradarshan kiya tha
 The message came from whatsapp that there is going to be a shortage of sugar and salt

 kapil sharma abhi tak apane sho kii tiarapy, sunil grover se ladaai or kamedi ko lekar charchaa main the
 But in the past, these things have stopped and focus on his health
 pichley kuch samay main set par teen baar behosh ho chuke kapil sharma kii sehat ko lekar phans pehle hi pareshaan the
 Everyone was afraid that he might not have any serious illness
 aise main unki bahan ke khulaase ne sabhi ko pareshaan ke saath hairaan bhi kar diya he ki vah depressant ke marij hai
 While Kapil Sharma's fans have been shocked by this news, the question is also arising that despite leaving many people behind in the race for career, what is the reason for Kapil Sharma getting depression? If you look at the career of the Kapil Sharma Shokapil and the events related to him in the recent past, then these 5 reasons for his depression are revealed - Performance Pressurepil Sharma Colors Channel Ka was left with a disputed turn and when he was struck with Sony, TRP got the deal fixed for several crores
 lekin soni ke saath kapil ko charchaa to mili magar kamedi nits vid kapil jaisi safalataa nahin
 Ever since The Kapil Sharma Show started in 2016, Kapil Sharma was under pressure from TRP or Performance Pressure
 ek saal bitate-bitate kapil sharma ke sho kii tiarapy behad neeche chali gayi or un par parform karne kaa dabaav badhata gaya
 These days the news is that Sony Channel may not even pursue its contract with Kapil Sharma
 safalataa kaa peak dekhne ke turant baad itnaa neeche aa janaa
 
 
 Can anyone depress Kapil Sharma? kharaab ho rahi he imejagirti tiarapy ke saath hi kapil sharma kii kamedi ke panch bhi fike pad rahe hai
 At the same time, frequent disputes are also associated with Kapil Sharma
 phir sunil grover ke saath hui unki ladaai main ye bhi mahasoos hua tha ki kapil sharma thodi akad main aa gaye hai
 In such a situation, Kapil Sharma will be worried about his image deteriorating due to the loss of work and name
 kapil ne jitani stregal ke saath mukaam paaya he, aise main naam kharaab hone kii pareshaani unke liye badi ho sakati he
 With friends, Kapil Sharma started his production house and his show with friends, he got away from them
 sunil grover ke saath hue jhagade ke baad unke tamaam saathiyon ne unase duuri bana lee
 Not only Sunil Grover, his close friends like Ali Asgar, Chandan Prabhakar went away from him
 shuruyaat main shaayad kapil sharma ko ehsaas nahin hua hoga lekin doston kaa saath chhootane kii kasak baad main mahasoos jarur hui hogi
 It may be that when all these things are felt, now they have depression due to the loss of their friends
 bahan kaa khulaasa- depressant se jujh rahe hai kamedian kapil sharmabadhata compitishanchhote parde par ek daur tha kamedi kaa
 But recently, these shows are not able to garner special trps
 philhal to nae shoj kii list main mitholgical serials behatar kar rahe hai
 And Kapil Sharma's show is not able to put itself in the top 10 either
 phir aane vaale samay main kapil sharma ke mukaable main kai shoj bhi aane vaale hai
 The Drama Company has started and promos of KBC are coming
 aise main compitishan main khud ko na dekhnaa bhi shaayad kapil sharma ke liye depressant kaa ek kaaran ho saktaa he
 Kapil Sharma, who tasted success even on the big screen from Kiss Kis Ko Pyaar Karoon, is also shooting for Firangi these days
 isamen unka paisa bhi laga he
 It is being told that on the small screen, he has started feeling that his film may not even sit
 ho saktaa he ki ye soch kar bhi kapil sharma pareshaan hon
 Bollywood stars who did not come on Kapil's show, shoot was canceled
 Now these are the professional reasons, due to which Kapil Sharma may be in depression

 com / l4ndhdxfr4 — Sakshi Singh Dhoni (@saakshisrawat) March 2, 2015 jila bainkon par lagu notebandi ke mudde par shivasena ne akramak rukh ikhtiyaar kar liya he
 Anandrao Adsool, the leader of the party in the Lok Sabha, has said that if he is not listened to on this issue, he can also get out of power
 adsul ne mumbai main samvaadadaataaon se baat karte hue yah bhi bataaya ki shivasena ke party pramukh uddhav thakare se is mudde par unki baat ho chuki he or is mudde par uddhav thakare kii bhi yahi bhoomika he
 In the parliamentary session starting on Monday, Shiv Sena has made up its mind to surround the government on this issue
 centre sarkaar ne bharat ke zila sahakaari bainkon ko puraane note vasuulne par roak laga di he
 Its biggest impact is visible in Maharashtra
 desh ke jila sahakaari bainkon main se sarvaadhik 31 keval maharashtra main hai
 They have around 3 crore customers and fds are deposited in these banks worth about 60 thousand crores
 shuruaati 4 dinon main jab zila sahakaari bainkon ko puraane noton ko swikaarne kii anumati thi tab keval maharashtra main hi 3200 karod rupee bainkon main jamaa hue the
 The old loan outstanding of the banks was huge in the amount deposited
 maharashtra rajya sahakaari bank rajya ke sabhi zila sahakaari bainkon kii apeks bank he
 Pramod Karnad, MD of this bank, also described the demonetisation applicable to district banks as a matter of concern
 unka tark he ki is pabandi kaa pratikul asar gramin kshetra par or usamen bhi khaaskar kisaan ke rosemara ke kaamon par hoga
 Because the network of district cooperative banks is found today even in remote rural areas
 tippaniyan Karnad said that if the district banks stopped their work against this ban, then the recovery of the loan of the farmer could also be affected
 rajya main 7 hajaar karod rupee se zyada kisaan karje die ja chuke hai or is saal ke behatar monsoon kii vajah se karje ke acchhee vasuuli kii ummid he
 All district cooperative banks in Maharashtra have also filed a petition in the Bombay High Court against the discriminatory attitude of the central government
 gauratlab he ki bijepi vidhayak praveen darekar hi is muhim kii aguwai kar rahe hai
 On the other hand, the government supporting the ban says that many accounts of district banks do not have KYC
 jisase kaale dhan ko pakad paanaa ek chunauti he
 The central government has prohibited the district cooperative banks in India from collecting old notes
 iskaa sabase bada asar maharashtra main dikh rahaa he
 Maharashtra has the maximum 31 out of the district cooperative banks in the country
 inke 3 karod ke aasapaas graahak hai or kareeb 60 hajaar karod rupee kii in bainkon main fds jamaa hai
 In the first 4 days, when the district cooperative banks were allowed to accept old notes, only 3200 crore rupees were deposited in banks in Maharashtra alone
 jamaa hui rakam main bainkon ke puraane karje kaa bakaayaa baari maatra main tha
 Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank is the apex bank of all the district cooperative banks in the state
 is bank ke emdi pramod karnad ne bhi zila bainkon ke liye lagu notebandi ko chintajanak bataaya he
 He argues that this ban will have an adverse effect on the rural areas and especially in the daily work of the farmer
 kyonki zila sahakaari bainkon kaa network aaj sudur gramin ilaakon main bhi paaya jaataa he
 The comments karnad ne bataaya ki is paabandi ke khilaaf agar zila bainkon ne apana kaam band kiya to kisaan ke karje kii vasuuli par bhi bura asar ho saktaa he
 More than 7 thousand crore rupees have been given loan in the state and due to better monsoon this year, good loan recovery is expected
 maharashtra ke sabhi zila sahakaari bainkon ne centre sarkaar ke bhedbhaavpurn ravaiye ke khilaaf bombai hycourt main yachika bhi daayar kii he
 Significantly, BJP MLA Praveen Darekar is leading this campaign
 udhar paabandi kaa samarthan karti sarkaar kaa kahana he ki zila bainkon ke kai khaaton main KYC nahin he
 Which is a challenge to catch black money

 lekin sirf yah khabar aate hi ki priyanka gandhi uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke prachaar kii kaman sanbhaalengi, jahaan-tahaan pade congressi apane kurton ko kalf dene lage hai
 On 5 July, when the Narendra Modi cabinet was being expanded, at the same time this news captured half the screen of news channels
 congress ne aakhirkaar kiya thos faislamodi sarkaar ke itane bade jalse ke dauraan budhu bakse kaa congress or bijepi main aadha-aadha bant janaa soochna prasaaran kii duniya main nayaa tajurba tha
 The reason for this was clear that after a decade and a half of reluctance, the Congress has finally decided that it is impossible to play in the politics of the country without re-emerging in Uttar Pradesh
 or party ab us mukaam par pahunch gai he, jab vah kisi or bure vakt ke liye sanjivani booti bachaakar nahin rakh sakati
 What is pk's strategy? The script of the latest developments has been written ever since Prashant Kishore was made manager of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections
 kareeb teen maheene pehle se is tarah kii khabaren aane lagi thim ki prashanth kishor ne formula diya he kipriyanka gandhi congress kaa prachaar karenor dilli kii purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ko mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa banaakar pesh kiya jaae
 At that time these things seemed to be airborne, but on July 4, the new incharge of Uttar Pradesh Congress Ghulam Nabi Azad held a long meeting with Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi at 10 Janpath
 mulaakaat kaa silsilaa agle din bhi chalaa
 After this Azad said, 'we all want Priyanka Gandhi to campaign for the Congress in Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki is bare main antim faisla khud unheen ko karnaa he
 It is wrong news that Priyanka Gandhi has been made the head of Uttar Pradesh Election Campaign Committee
 'aaazaad ko prabharee ke taur par aage kiyadarasal, yah congress kivyapak ranneetika hissaa he
 According to Congress sources, the role of Prashant Kishor in Uttar Pradesh elections is going to be much bigger than it appears
 prashanth ke formule ke tahat hi aaazaad ko bharosemand muslim chehre ke taur par upi bheja gaya he
 Salman Khurshid, the other Muslim face of the party, suddenly landed on the Twitter platform a few days ago and opened a Dhundhar Morcha against the BJP
 pradesh sanghathan kaa cheharaa badalane kii taiyaariiske alaava jald hi uttar pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh nirmal khatri ko koi or jimmedaari di jaaegi
 Khatri Acharya, an MP from Faizabad, is the grandson of Narendra Dev and is very close to the Gandhi family, but does not fit into Prashant's caste formula
 congress kii ranneeti brahman or muslim, donon ko apni ore khinchne kii he
 By the way, Khatri is excited at the prospect of Priyanka entering the campaign field, 'if Priyanka campaigned in the state, there will be new enthusiasm in both the public and the workers

 Dixit himself said, "at first i was in a feeling that there was very little time left
 lekin party jo bhi aadesh degi, uskaa paalan karuungi
 But the Congress is not in a hurry
 priyanka ko manch par laane se pehle congress jameen kii majbootee thok-bajaakar dekh lenaa chaahati he
 The mechanism of candidate selection is one of its examples, that usually a month before the election, the party that declared the candidate started the process of candidate selection from the first week of June
 iske tahat har daavedaar ko booth pratinidhiyon kii list ke saath apana biodata prashanth kii team ko email karnaa he
 After this, Prashant's team will talk to the respective contenders over the phone
 kai maamalon main daavedaaron se apane sabhi booth pratinidhiyon ke saath lakhanu aane ke liye bhi kaha ja rahaa he, taaki unhen training di ja sake
 With this whole exercise, Prashant wants to create a data bank of at least eight-ten supporters for the Congress at every booth, which will help in making the election campaign on the ground
 sidhe daavedaaron se judane kii kavaidauttar pradesh congress ke ek varisht netaa ne bataaya, 'sachai yah he ki dedh sau siton ke alaava baaki siton par congress ke paas dhang ke pratyaashee nahin hai
 In such a situation, whether someone says it or not, the role of Prashant Kishore is the most important

 The candidate who will be declared right by the most people will be given the ticket
 ' congress kii koshish he ki agast tak pratyaashiyon ke naam final ho jaaen
 That is, before Priyanka comes to the ground, the Congress will have a 'alive' list of its booth agents and there will be a large data base of workers in every assembly
 party main yah cheez arase baad ho rahi he
 Actor excited by Priyanka's arrival, when India Today asked former MP Rajesh Mishra from Varanasi how Priyanka will come and raise this weak Congress, then Mishra said, 'congress has never been a cadre base party, Congress is a mass base party
 party lambey samay se satta main nahin he, isliye hamaare bahut se netaa idhar-udhar chale gaye
 After all in SP, BSP and BJP, our old leaders have families only
 priyanka saamne aaengi to janata congress ke peeche aegi or aap dekhenge ki bahut se log party main lautenge
 The real thing is that there will be an atmosphere of Congress
 ' mishra us tarah ke netaa hai jo pradesh adhyaksh ke liye prashanth kishor kii ore se gadhe gaye formule main jati or urja, donon kii drushti se samaa sakate hai
 More impact on urban voters: The party is assuming that the most impact of Priyanka's arrival will be seen on the urban voters
 sanyog se in siton par paaramparik rup se bijepi kaa dabadabaa rahaa he
 That is, the enthusiasm and the brahmin-muslim equation combined with Priyanka's arrival with traditional votes on these seats can change the fortunes of the Congress
 100 siten jeetne kaa lakshyavaise bhi pichley vidhansabha chunaav main 405 main se sirf 28 siten paane vaali congress is baar 100 siten jeetne kaa lakshya lekar chal rahi he

 After this post by Vinta Nanda, many people on social media are taking the name of Alok Nath, who is often called 'sanskari actor' and is demanding action on him
 tippaniyan Vinta Nanda has alleged in her post that the actor allegedly raped her and earlier she also misbehaved with lead actress Navneet Nishan of the serial 'tara'
 haalanki unhone apni post main navaneet nishaan kaa zikr nahin kiya he
 He further wrote, The actor's behavior has only deteriorated after this and Nanda and other production colleagues have decided to remove the actor
 baad main channel ke dabaav kii vajah se 'tara' ko bich main hi band kar diya gaya or nanda ke duusare sho bhi cancil kar diye gaye

 Watch full video: dedh saal ke dauraan hue desh ke teen bade dangon main kuch baaten bahut kaaman-si raheen
 First, minor reasons, second is the role of a leader and third, the big political gains
 mujffarnagar (upi), trilokapuri (dilli) or ab bihar kaa mujffarpur dekh lijie
 
 
 1
 maamuli vajah- dedh saal pehle uttarapradesh main mujffarnagar dangon kii shuruyaat ek chhedchhad kii ghatana se hi shuru hui thi
 On the way to school a Hindu Jat student was harassed by some Muslim youth
 jab is par aapatti lene uske do bhai gaye to donon kii hatya kar di gai
 And then muzaffarnagar-saharanpur waters rose
 - pichley saal diwali ke turant baad dilli kii trilokpur main dange hue
 The only reason was that a temporary platform near a mosque here was playing a loudspeaker at the mother's outpost
 jisase namaaj main pareshaani ho rahi thi
 - And now Muzaffarpur in Bihar, where a Hindu youth was allegedly murdered by his Muslim girlfriend's brother in a love affair
 or uske baad gussai bheed ne badale kii karrwai shuru kii
 Four bodies have been found and reports of several missing people

 Those who put ghee in the fire - after the murder in Muzaffarnagar's Kawal, the Jat community held a panchayat on the one hand, and on Friday, the Muslim community gathered outside the mosque after Friday prayers
 donon hi maukon par siyaasi dalon ke netaaon ne bhadakaau bayaan die
 a secret meeting was allegedly held at the office of local BJP leader Sunil Vaidya in the evening after a dispute at Mata Ki Chowki in Trilokpuri
 baithak khatm hone ke baad sabhi log naare lagaate hue baahar nikle the
 And right after that riots started there
 - lekin, mujffarpur main hindu yuvak ke muslim yuvati se prem karne or phir laapata ho jane kii khabaron se ilaake ke hindu bhadke hue the
 It is not yet known whether anyone was leading this crowd
 Because, it is not natural to find a crowd of thousands of people on fire as soon as the corpse is found

 or politics- mujffarnagar main dangon ko chunavi raajnneeti se bhi joda gaya
 Lok Sabha elections were to be held shortly after
 aise main aabaadi ke maan se desh ke sabase bade rajya uttarapradesh main voton kaa dhruvikaran kuch partiyon ke liye phydemand rahaa
 Congress and Samajwadi Party, where Muslims are engaged in grabbing the vote bank
 vahiin bhaajapa kii najar hindu vot par thi
 The result also came as expected
 is ilaake kii sabhi das siten bhaajapa ne jeet leen
 Politics was also responsible for the Trilokpuri riots
 yahaan se vidhayak rahe sunil vaidya pichley chunaav aam aadmi party ke pratyaashee se haar gaye the
 To incite this riot, he was accused of doing this to regain his political ground
 - mujffarpur main hue fasaad ke baad mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi mumbai se laut aae
 Lalu Prasad Yadav, the government's aide, is talking directly to police officers the whole time
 kyonki isi saal bihar vidhansabha ke chunaav hone hai
 If the riots erupt, votes will be distributed
 jediu or rajd kii najar muslim voton par hogi to bhaajapa phir hindu voton ko aakarshith karegi

 Indian telecom companies may gradually increase mobile rates to extract the cost of spectrum
 mudies ne somvaar ko yah baat kahi
 In the recently concluded spectrum auction, telecom operators 1

 The global credit rating agency said, "this high cost is negative for the country's telecom operators in terms of credit

 tamilnadu kii raajnneeti kaa ek bada stambh rahe em karunanidhi duniya ko alavida kah gaye or apane peeche chhod gaye sangharsh kii wo gaatha, jisane rajya kii siyasat ko hi badal kar rakh diya
 Born into an ordinary family in eastern Tamil Nadu, Karunanidhi studied up to class eight only due to poverty
 iske baad unhone raajnneeti main kadam rakh diya
 The politics of Karunanidhi, who changed the politics of Tamil Nadu, was mired in controversies
 haalanki wo jivan ke kisi bhi padaav main shithil nahin pade
 Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi's controversy The political rivalry between Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi is well known
 1989 main tamilnadu vidhansabha main tatkaaleen mukhyamantri karunanidhi ke saamne jayalalita ke apmaan kii ghatana ne rajya kii siyasat main nijee vaimnasy badhaane kaa kaam kiya
 After a few years when Jayalalithaa became the Chief Minister, she had Karunanidhi sleeping in the middle of the night and got her into a lockup
 yah tasviir puure desh ne dekhi ki kis kadar karunanidhi ast-vyast kapado main police ke saamne cheekh pukaar kar rahe the
 Questions related to relationship with LTTE His relationship with LTTE also raised many questions
 purv pradhanmantri chandrashekhar kaa kahana tha ki altitii se sambandhon ke kaaran hi saal 1991 main unhone karunanidhi sarkaar ko barkhaast kiya tha
 Subramanian Swamy, who was a minister in the Chandrashekhar government today, remembers Karunanidhi in this way - Karunanidhi did politics on his own terms
 un par bhrashtachar or vanshavaad ke aarope lage, lekin in aaropon ke bich apni pari khelkar wo pavilion laut gaye
 Just six steps away from the century
 dost ne bana lee durigaribi main bachapan dhansa tha, lekin javaani kaa hausala tha or isiilie kamyaabi kii us bulandi ko karunanidhi ne apane kadamon se chhu liya
 It sounds like a film story
 filmi kahani se yaad aayaa ki tamil filmon ke superstar emji ramchandran kabhi karunanidhi ke dost hote the or unhen apana netaa bhi maanate the
 However, MG Ramachandran, after some time, kept away from him by accusing him of corruption and dynasty
 iske baad tamilnadu kii raajnneeti badal gai
 Actually, MG Ramachandran broke away from DMK to form AIADMK and also became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu
 garibi ke chalate chhodani padi padhaikarunanidhi ke garibi kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki aathvin ke baad unako padhai chhodani padi
 After this he went into politics, but also turned to Tamil films parallel to it, where the scripted films written on him started to flag the success
 vah aise vidwaan the jinhone dasvin paas na hokar bhi 100 se zyada kitaaben likhin or un kahaniyon par filmein baniin
 MG Ramachandran's performance in these films made him a superstar, but when his first wife Padmavati wanted to promote son Muthu into films, the son's film did not work
 saath hi mjiaar se bhi unke sambandh bigadate gaye
 Karunanidhi Nekrunanidhi's politics of three marriages was as much an extension of his films, an expansion of his films as well as his family
 tamil raajnneeti or film ke is diggaj chehre ne teen shaadiyaan kii or inke chah bachche hue
 But during his youth, Adarsh was so dominant that he did not marry his girlfriend because of his principles
 premika se nahin kii thi shaadidrasal, 1944 main jab karunanidhi 20 saal ke the to apni premika se shaadi karnaa chaahate the lekin unki premika ke gharavaale paramparaagat tareeke se shaadi karne se peeche hatane ko taiyaar nahin the
 The traditional way means mantras and mangalsutra etc
 karunanidhi ise paakhand maanate the or isiilie vah taiyaar nahin hue
 As a result, Dilruba Ruthi and the relationship broke up

 Significantly, on December 20 last month, the High Court had expressed its displeasure over failing to control noise pollution in Uttar Pradesh and had asked the state government to visit all religious places of the state - mosques, temples, gurudwaras or other public places
 The loudspeakers are installed only after obtaining permission from the concerned authorities

 The CBI has told the Supreme Court that telecom companies established during Raja's tenure illegally used Swan Telecom and Loop Telecom as undercover companies to get 2G spectrum
 agency ne adaalat main kaha tha ki raja ‘dhokhadhadi, jaalsaji or bhrashtachar’ ke aaropon kaa saamana karenge
 The CBI said before the court that Swan and Loop hid details about their companies to get spectrum and these companies would face charges of 'fraud and criminal conspiracy'
 agency ne adaalat ko bataaya ki raja ke kaarykaal ke dauraan kai companiyon ko 2ji spectrum dilaane ke liye pehle aao-pehle paao kii niti ko badalte hue ‘jaalsaji’ kiye jane ke saboot bhi hai
 However, according to CBI sources, the loss to the exchequer cannot be included in the charge sheet as the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is yet to assess the loss in this allocation

 The CBI had told the court last year that it would file the first charge sheet by March 31, which would also contain information about the investigation conducted by the agency and the Enforcement Directorate in the case
 iske baad sibiai ne iske liye do or dinon kaa samay maanga
 There is a possibility that the CBI will seek permission from the court to continue the investigation in the case after filing the first charge sheet

 The Supreme Court has given more time to the Central Government to present its stand on the issue of declaring Ram Setu a national monument or not

 Which was approved isse pehle supreme court ne sarkaar se is mudde par apana rukh saaf karne ko kaha tha
 In fact, in 2007, after the Madras High Court knocked on the door, Janata Party President Subramaniam Swamy had demanded the declaration of Ram Setu as a national heritage, after which the whole controversy reached the Supreme Court
 swami ke mutabik centre sarkaar ne pichley 4 saal main unki is maang par naa to jawaab diya he or naa hi aisi koi study karwaai he
 Hence Swami once again raised the issue of declaring Ram Setu as a national heritage

 Jayalalithaa has said that in view of the objections raised last time due to the archaeological, historical and cultural importance of Ram Setu, she appeals that the Central Government will take steps to declare Ram Setu a national monument without delay

 Former Haryana state president Ashok Tanwar and former Mumbai president Sanjay Nirupam have raised the flag of rebellion over the Congress's ticket distribution in both states
 aise main in donon netaaon ne pehle se hi bure daur se guzar rahi congress party kii pareshaani ko or bhi badha diya he
 In fact, Ashok Tanwar submitted a list of his five dozen supporters to the Congress high command for the ticket, which has been completely ignored
 tanvar chaah rahe the ki paanch saal tak unke saath jude rahe samarthakon ko bhi tikat mili, lekin bhupendra singh hooda ke chalate unke ek bhi samarthak ko tikat nahin mila
 Angered by the neglect of his supporters, former Congress state president Ashok Tanwar resigned from all party posts
 ashok tanvar ne aarope lagaaya kiharyana congress ab 'hooda congress'banati ja rahi he
 He claimed, 'who shed blood and sweat for five years, but was ignored in ticket distribution
 netritv bhi yahi chahta tha lekin kuch logon ke nihit swaarth hai, wo nahin chaahate hai ki nae log aaen
 When BJP can cut tickets of sitting mlas, why not us? Angry Ashok Tanwar has also indicated not to campaign for Congress in Haryana

 Sanjay Nirupam said, 'it seems that the Congress party no longer wants my services
 maine vidhansabha chunaav ke liye mumbai main sirf ek naam kii sifarish kii thi
 It is heard that it has also been rejected
 jaisaa ki maine pehle netritv ko bataaya tha, us sthiti main main chunaav prachaar main bhaag nahin luungaa
 This is my final decision
 ' itnaa hi nahin sanjay nirupam ne twi kar likhaa, 'mujhe ummid he ki party ko gudby kehane kaa vakt nahin aayega, lekin, leadership jis tarah se mere saath bartaav kar rahi he, usase lagata he ki ab vah din dur nahin he
 On the other hand, BJP has cut tickets to a dozen mlas and many ministers in Haryana and Maharashtra
 haryana main congress ke kai mantri or saansad apane parivaar ke sadasyon ke liye tikat maang rahe the, lekin party ne inhen tikat nahin diya he
 Despite this, there was no rebellion in the BJP

 jis din em

 kaa antim paper tha, rajasthan roadways main achaanak kisi baat par hadtaal ho gai or is baat se bekhbar main sumerpur bas stand par baitha sirohi jane vaali bas kaa intjaar karata rahaa
 The paper was from ten o'clock and it took at least one hour to reach Sirohi by bus from Sumerpur
 jab sava nau baj gaye or koi bas nahin ai to maine poochtacha kii
 When the strike was discovered, i was a little nervous, but there was still hope for trucks
 main bas stand se chalakar chungi naake chalaa gaya kyonki vahaan se trek milane kii sambhaavna zyada thi
 When no truck appeared till about ten o'clock, i thought to call Ugmaraj or Dr
 Purohit and request him to leave Sirohi on his motorcycle
 udhar sirohi main bhargav sahab, durga prasad ji or mere anya mitra pareshaan ho rahe the ki paper shuru hue itani der ho gai or swayan prakaash kaa koi pataa nahin he
 At the same time a shabby truck appeared to be coming at a slow pace
 mere haath dene se trek ruk bhi gaya, vah ja bhi sirohi rahaa tha, usne mujhe baitha liya lekin raste main paldi gaanv main ek dhabas ke saamne khadaa ho gaya
 The driver-player told that he would eat food
 maine haath jodakar unhen samajhaayaa ki meri pariksha he, samay par nahin pahunch paaya to meraa puraa saal kharaab ho jayega, isse to aaj agar ve paldi kii bajaay sirohi main khaanaa kha len, meri taraf se, to badi meharbaani hogi
 They did not respond to me and left me there and entered the dhaba
 main maayoos hokar haive par aa gaya or aate-jate vaahanon ko haath dene laga
 After some time the same shabby truck came and the Khalasi made a voice, "let's go"
 main kuch samaj nahin paaya ki hua kya he or samajhane kaa samay kahaan tha?main furti se trek main chadh gaya
 The driver drove the truck in such a way that i started repeatedly falling to the right and left, but at eleven thirty and half, he landed me at the three light intersection of Sirohi
 yahaan se college kaa pandrah minute kaa rasta tha
 Usually four to five autos are always standing at this intersection but there was not one on that day
 main tej-tej chalate or bich-bich main daud lagaate haanfata -kaanpata paune baarah baje college pahunchaa
 Durga Prasad ji was leaving his inspection duty and was standing at the main gate looking at my way
 mujhe dekhte hi unhone apane nile vijay super scooter main kik maari or mujhe bagaiyr ek bhi shabd puche, bole pariksha haul tak le gayi
 Immediately i was caught copy-paper and as soon as a few words of the first question came in front of my eyes, i started writing the answer
 kuch samay baad bhargav sahab aaye or hasbamaloom sabhi parikshaarthiyon ke bich tahaltey hue mere paas aakar ek minute ruke, dhire se meri peeth par haath rakh kar chale gaye
 What kind of contribution does a person make in making a man
 das baje kii pariksha main kisi parikshaarthi ko baarah baje pravesh kii anumati dena bhargav sahab ke liye bhi saral nahin rahaa hoga
 And how to express my gratitude to the driver or the visitor who gave up their food for my sake
 kya main inlogon kii maanviyata or krupa ko kabhi bhul saktaa hum?*** Bank of Baroda has invited applications for the 1039 posts of Specialist Officer
