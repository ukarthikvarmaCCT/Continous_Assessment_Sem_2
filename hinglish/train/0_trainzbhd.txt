 Why 110 crore people have been excluded from this scheme
 gurusvaami se ham puuchhenge ki ve kis aadhaar par kehete hai ki atal pension yojana ke tahat vahi paisa aapako saath saal baad milegaa jo aapane jamaa kiya he
 Not only this, the number of people who take insurance will be very less
 zyada tar log batch jaaenge
 In such a situation, the premium amount will go in the pocket of banks
 aapako dekhnaa hoga ki 50 saal yaa 60 saal hone par mrityu dar kya he
 Whatever it is, there should be discussion about such policies to which the future of most people is connected
 18 se 40 saal kii umr ke yuva hi is beemaa ke paatr honge jiskaa laabh 60 saal ke hone par milegaa
 For this, from 42 rupees to 1452 rupees have to be paid every month for sixty years
 is aadhaar par pension kii raashi ek hazaar se paanch hazaar tak tay ho sakegi
 For this, you will have to save in the account and if you do not fill it, the government will fill it
 lekin sarkaar 31 disambar tak hi vishesh madad karegi
 The criticism is that this scheme is only for people between 18 and 50 years old
 50 saal se paar ke logon ko kyon baahar kar diya gaya
 Senior citizens are also not included
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki garibon ke liye jo pension yojana he uske liye sabko ek hazaar rupaya diya ja rahaa he
 The Congress says that the Government of India has packaging the Aam Aadmi Bima Yojana, Rajiv Gandhi Shilpi Swasthya Yojana and National Health Scheme
 rajeev gandhi shilpi swasthya beemaa yojana ke tahat shilpkaar, uski patni or do bacchon ko beemaa cover diya gaya tha
 From the day of birth till the age of 80 years were within its scope
 697 or 797 rupee premium sarkaar degi har saal or shilpkaar apni taraf se degaa 100 rupee har saal
 Any medical treatment could be done in any hospital in the country
 tippaniyan Now it has to be seen what is the status of these schemes
 garibi rekha se neeche ke logon ke liye ek or yojana ai thi rashtriya swasthya beemaa yojana jo chal rahi he
 Our guest Mohan Guruswamy has written that in none of the three schemes launched by the Modi government, the government will not give a single penny on its behalf
 sab janata ko dena hoga or naam sarkaar kaa hoga
 He argues that only those who have bank accounts will get the benefit of these schemes
 120 karod kii aabaadi vaale desh main 15 karod logon ke hi bank khate hai
 Why 110 crore people have been excluded from this scheme

 aalochana yah he ki yah yojana 18 se 50 saal ke logon ke liye hi hai
 Why people from beyond 50 years were excluded
 senior citigen bhi shaamil nahin hai
 The Prime Minister said that a thousand rupees is being given to everyone for the pension scheme for the poor
 congress kahati he ki bharat sarkaar ne aam aadmi beemaa yojana, rajeev gandhi shilpi swasthya yojana or rashtriya swasthya yojana kii hi packaging kar di he
 Under the Rajiv Gandhi Shilpi Health Insurance Scheme, the craftsman, his wife and two children were given insurance cover
 janm ke din se 80 saal kii umr tak iske daayre main the
 The government will pay a premium of 697 and 797 rupees every year and craftsman will give 100 rupees every year on his behalf
 desh ke kisi bhi astpal main koi bhi medical ilaaj karaayaa ja saktaa tha
 The comments ab yah dekhnaa hoga ki in yojanaon kii sthiti kya he
 Another scheme for people below poverty line was National Health Insurance Scheme which is running
 hamaare mehmaan mohan gurusvaami ne likhaa he ki modi sarkaar ne jo teen yojanaayen launch kii hai unamem se kisi main bhi sarkaar apni taraf se ek paisa nahin degi
 Everyone has to give it to the public and the name will go to the government
 unki daleel he ki in yojanaon kaa laabh usee ko milegaa jiske paas bank khaataa he
 In a country with a population of 120 crores, only 150 million people have bank accounts
 110 karod log is skim se baahar kyon kiye gaye hai
 We will ask Guruswami on what basis they say that under Atal Pension Yojana you will get the same money after sixty years that you have deposited
 yahi nahin jitne log beemaa lenge usamen marane waalon kii sankhya bahut kam hogi
 More people will be saved
 aise main premium raashi bainkon kii jeb main chali jaaegi
 You have to see what the death rate is when it is 50 years or 60 years
 jo bhi he aisi nitiyon ke bare main charchaa honi chahie jisase zyaadaatar logon kaa bhavishya judaa he
 Now it has to be seen what is the status of these schemes

 modi sarkaar apana ek saal puraa karne ja rahi he
 In a year, in which areas the government managed to shed the winds of development and where things could not improve yet, Aaj Tak's serious 'churning' started at 11 am
 india today ke kansalting editor rajdeep saradesai ne kendriya rasayan or urvarak mantri anant kumaar se modi sarkaar kii chuninda uplabdhiyon ke bare main poocha
 On this, he told that in the last four months, the Modi government has given bank accounts to 15 crore poor
 jandhan yojana shuru kii he
 Atal Pension Yojana has been launched for social security of the poor
 duniyabar main bharat kaa maan-sammaan badhaaya he
 Taj Mahal will be wifi: Ravi Shankar Prasadchar will not increase for urea for years, Anant Kumar said in the churning that we are not able to make urea according to the demand
 isliye blike marketing ho rahi he
 Modi is going to bring a new policy under the leadership of the government
 ham vaada karte hai ki aane vaale chaar main uria kaa daam nahin badhegaa
 Keeping the price the same will increase production rapidly
 blike marketing khatm karnaa hamaara sabase bada lakshya he

 bharat par majboot hua duniya kaa vishwasasoot-boot v / s jhooth-lut kii sarkarrajdeep saradesai ne kaha ki modi kii sarkaar ko suut-boot kii sarkaar kaha jaataa he
 On this, Ananth Kumar said that in the last 10 years, sonia-rahul has run a government of lies and loot in the UPA government
 pichley 60 saal main jo sudhaar nahin hua he, vah pichley ek saal main modi sarkaar ne kar dikhaaya he
 Another promise of Modi's minister, 'will not increase urea prices' Sabka Saath, development of all, he said that no state is discriminated against for development
 har pradesh or unke mukhyamantriyon kii raay lee jaati he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi periodically meets the Chief Ministers of the state

 When Farakrajdeep Sardesai asked the difference between Vajpayee and Modi, he said, "there is a meeting of two-three hours in both the governments
" atal ji ne chah saal desh kaa sanchaalan kiya, vah ek model he
 On the same basis, Narendra Modi is running the government

 There is a furore over data leaks on social media
 data li ke aaropon se vivaadon ke ghere main ai cambridge analitica kii kahani ne washington se lekar nai dilli tak sabko chaunkaa diya
 There was a debate in India as to how safe your data is on social media
 lekin data li ke is ho hangaame ke bich pehle yah samajhate hai ki aakhir data kya he? soshal media takanic ke jaankaar javed ahamed ke mutabik aapaki har jaankaree jo aap kisimadhyam se mobile phone aplicoshan, internet yaa soshal media par muhaiyaa karaate hai vahi data he
 In this data, you can have every such information from where you go, what you do, by taking contact numbers of your peers, saved in your mobile from your phone number
 lekin data li kii samasya itani gambhir nahin he, jitani data ke bare main vah jaankaree jo ham aapako bataane vaale hai
 The data leaking from social media is actually like a small fish in a pond
 ajtak kii ground investigeshan main jo khulaasa hua he, vah aapako hairat main daal degaa
 Do you also know that every information related to you is in the hands of the merchants roaming around the market and is being sold for just 5-5 thousand rupees
 yah sach saamne laane ke liye ajtak ne jab data ke in saudagaron se sampark kiya to ve khud hi molbhav karne lage
 Shortly after Aaj Tak's team tried to contact a similar data dealer, we received a call from a female representative of a company selling data
 cosmetic company kaa agent banakar sampark kar rahe ajtak ke patrkaar ne data saudagar company kii pratinidhi se dilli or mumbai main 5 xxrep 4 0 logon kaa database maanga, jisamen vyakti kaa naam, uskaa pesha, kamai or umr ke byore maange
 Data data of one lakh people for 5000 rupees
 The woman representative of the merchant company agreed to give us data of one lakh people for 5000 rupees
 itnaa hi nahin, iske liye usne na to koi shart rakhi or na hi koi seemaa
 This company also agreed to give us data related to women
 iske alaava vah hamaari cosmetinc company ke utpaada se jude vigyaapan in tamaam logon ke mobile numberon tak alag alag madhyamon se pahunchane ke liye bhi taiyaar ho gai
 The rate for just about everything was fixed
 isi tarah hamane mumbai main besd ek or company ke agent se baat kii
 This agent also agreed to sell us the data of one lakh people in Delhi and Mumbai for just 5-7 thousand rupees
 agent ne yahaan tak kaha ki agar main chaahun to 18 fisadi jiesti bhi de saktaa hum or agar na chaahun to jiesti se bachaa bhi ja saktaa he
 Apparently a picture shows how companies selling data are now dealing like big crocodiles, not small fish
 sabase dilachasp baat yah he ki ab aapako kisi kaa bhi data kharidne ke liye kisi se milane kii jarurat tak nahin he
 Sara goes home on a mobile
 aap kotesan mangie, paisa unke acount main transfar kiijie or aapke email par lakhon logon kaa data chutki main pahunch jayega
 This data is also used on social media
 isse ek tasviir or saaf hoti he ki kaise soshal media puri tarah commercial ho gaya he
 Businessmen can sell their products on social media and politicians can also have their own agenda
 aise logon kii har jarurat puri karne ke liye bazaar main data ke ye saudagar baithe hai
 The managing director of a social media management company, on the condition of anonymity, told us that he also has such data, which is openly sold in the market and which he can use for every section of the society
 shaks kii maane bike insurance companiyaan, political partiyaan, netaaon sahit bollywood kii hastiyaan aisi companiyon kaa istemaal kartargated publictak apni pahunch banane kii koshish karte hai
 In Aaj Tak's ground report, it became completely clear that nothing is free in the world of social media, and if you are getting something free then you are the only product in this data world

 CBI denies Vijay's involvement in the murder
 is prakaran main dhruv kii bhoomika ke bare main jaanch jari he
 To know the truth, Dhruv had a polygraph test on March 24, in which he boasted about the relationship with Shehla, Zahida and other women
 jo baat saamne ai, vah kuch is tarah haih dhruv jaahida ke saath khatarnaak khel khel rahe the
 He used to keep on burning her by expressing that she still has relations with Shehla
 isse jaahida ke man main shahala ke prati jehar bhar gaya, jise usne apni diary main bakhubi jaahir bhi kiya he
 Zahida writes that she used to pay money to her domestic help Irshad to keep an eye on Shehla
 sibiai ne dhruv-jaahida sambandhon main ai daraar kaa phayda uthaane kaa faisla kiya
 He interrogates Dhruv showing him the CD he got from Zahida's office
 dhruv sidi dekhakar awak rah gaye kyonki unhen jaraa bhi andaaj nahin tha ki jaahida ne unke saath antarang kshanon ko record kar liya he
 He pleaded with the CBI not to open the secret of CD and agreed to open his mouth about Zahida
 sibiai ke adhikariyon ne gupt rup se dhruv ke jawaab ko record kar liya or use jaahida ko dikhaaya
 Zahida knew by then that the whole game was over
 yah mahasoos karte hue ki vah ladaai main akeli he, usne kaha ki shahala kii hatya kii sajeesh main dhruv bhi shaamil tha
 Zahida accuses Dhruv that they used to incite him to kill Shehla
 usne yah bhi daawa kiya ki unhone hi use saaqib ali 'danger' se milwaaya tha
 Shakib is a local goon who allegedly killed Shehla through mercenary killers named Irfan and Tabish Khan
 haalanki jaahida apane daavon ke samarthan main saboot nahin de saki
 But CBI is investigating Dhruva's call to Shehla on August 15, 2011
 16 agast ko shahala kii hatya se 25 minute pehle subah 10:50 baje uski landline par dhruv kii patni vandana kaa kol aayaa tha
 Vandana did not say anything and disconnected the phone after eight seconds

 She wanted to warn his wife, whose name was also Vandana
 vandana ne sibiai ko bataaya, ''main unase kahana chaahati thi ki shahala hamaare pariwaron ko barbaad kar rahi he
 The CBI also investigated his possible role in the murder
 lekin baad main usne is vikalp ko khaarij kar diya
 Dhruv and Vandana have two sons
 bada betaa bhopal sthit neshnal lau institute main pard rahaa he
 So the younger son is a student of Campion School in Bhopal itself
 jab india today ne bhopal main dhruv narayan singh ko phone kiya to unhone baatcheet karne se inkaar kar diya

 Shehla's relationship with Dhruv dates back to 2000, when she returned from Delhi to Bhopal to open the first event company, Miracles

 shahala ne bhopal main sanyukt rup se mud chalange car raily yojit karne ke liye udai cultural socity ke saath kaam kiya tha
 Dhruva was the patron of this society
 donon ke dost bataate hai ki dhruv ne shahala ke kehane par kayapalat hi kar liya
 They lost their weight and filled their wardrobes with furnishings
 jaahir he, unhen shahala se ishk ho gaya tha
 Zahida is from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh

 My son is completely in his fist
 uske saamne munh nahin khol saktaa
 "CBI has also arrested 25-year-old Saba Farooqui, Zahida's assistant, on suspicion that she may be involved in the crime
 sabaa ne sibiai ko bataaya ki usne 'appi' ko kai baar chetavanee dene kii koshish kii ki ve jo kuch kar rahi hai uskaa nateeja bura hoga, lekin unhone dhyaan nahin diya
 Zahida had bought into the craze recently by purchasing a bungalow barely 100 meters from Shehla's house in kohe-fiza, a high-class Muslim neighborhood
 shooter irfan or uske saathiyon ne shahala ko bilkul kareeb se goli maarane se pehle uski gatividhiyon par yaheen se najar rakhi thi

 Sultan says, "I know Tarunji was very close to Shehla
 uski maut ke baad unke na aane par mujhe bahut bura laga tha
 He called immediately after the murder of Shehla, but to know whether the news was true or false
 '' yadi vijay kii pratikriya se ve dukhi the to dhruv kii pratikriya se stabdh
 Sultan recalls, "immediately after the incident i called Dhruvji thinking that he would be of some help
 maine kaha ki shahala nahin rahi
 But they did not say anything
 phir phone cat gaya
 "as friendship with Vijay grew, Shehla distanced herself from Dhruva
" vijay ne india today se kaha ki shahala unki 'ghanishtha mitra' thi or uske saath unke 'bauddhik sambandh' the
 According to Shehla's father, her daughter and Vijay had plans to start a magazine on india-china relations

 GST (GST) is the new direct tax regime of the Government of India which is coming into effect from 1 July 2017
 jiesti kaa puraa naam guds and sarvice tex (GST) he
 It is being levied for more than 20 indirect taxes levied by the Center and the states
 jiesti 1 july se puure desh main lagu kiya janaa he
 After the GST, taxes on many services and goods will be abolished
 kinhin vastuon ke utpaadan se lekar uske upabhokta ke haathon main pahunchane ke bich kai prakaar ke tex ab tak lagate rahe hai
 These different types of taxes will be eliminated with the imposition of this one tax, or say that different types of taxes which can reach your hands of any goods or service will now be collected within this tax
 lekin aisa nahin he ki isse vibhinn charnon main lage vyapaariyon yaa kaarobaariyon ko koi ghaataa hoga
 At this end, all the benefits will be included in the tax on the stage
 jaahir he ki vastu evam sevaaon par lagane vaala is tex kii alag alag saamaan va seva par alag alag mad hogi
 Let us tell you which tax will come under it and what effect it will have on which class of people
 to aaie sabase pehle yah jaane ki vibhinn jiesti karon ke bare main jinamein anya kar samahit kar die jaaenge
 These currently applicable taxes will later be included in GST: central exise duty, adishnal exise duty, sarvice tex, adishnal customs duty, adishnal duty of customs
 These taxes present at the state level will be included in GST: state waite / cells tex, manoranjan kar (sthaneey nikaay dwaara lagaae jane vaale karon ke atirikt), central cells tex (vah jo centre dwaara lagaaya jaataa he or rajyon dwaara vasula jaataa he), okatrai or entry tex, parchez tex, lagjri tex, satte, lottery or jue par tex
 After the implementation of GST, it will benefit at all levels associated with it
 jaise ki vibhinn sambandhit rajyon, centre sarkaar, saamaan va sevaaon ke nirmaataaon or aapurtikartaaon, or is chen ke aakhri charan par maujuud upabhokta ko bhi iskaa laabh milegaa
 Let us know at a glance how which will benefit: bijness or industry ko isse kya laabh hoga- jiestn yani maal evam sevakar network (BGSTN) ke jariye jiesti ke puure ke puure system ko boost milegaa
 All services related to registration, returns, payment etc
 can be obtained through GSTN for all taxpayers, so that compliance with GST can be done in a much easier and transparent manner
 kar daron or uske dhaanche main ekarupatha aegi
 GST will ensure that indirect tax rates and structures are common across the country
 duusare shabdon main, jiesti desh main bijness karne ko tex neutral bana degaa chaahe vyakti kisi bhi shahar yaa rajya main kyon na kaarobaar kar rahaa ho
 GST will bring different changes for the common man
 inamen kuch chizon kaa mahangaa hona lekin kuch chizon kaa sasta hona shaamil he
 Small cars, suvs, bikes, paint and cement, movie tickets, electrical goods (fans, bulbs, water heaters, air coolers), everyday necessities, ready-made clothes, their purchase can become cheaper once GST is implemented
 
 jabaki cigarette, trek jaise vyavsaayik vaahan, mobile phone kol, kapade, branded jewelery, rail, bas, hawaii tikat mahange ho sakate hai
 For the first five years, some other taxes will also be levied on materials like cars, cold drinks and tobacco products, to compensate for the loss of the states
 muawza kanoon is lihaaz se taiyaar kiya gaya he, taaki jiesti ke lagu hone par rajyon ke rajasav nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye centre sarkaar dwaara kiye gaye vaade ko sanvaidhanik jama pahanaaya ja sake
 The comments jiesti vyavastha main chaar daren- 5, 12, 18 or 28 pratishat- tay kii gai hai
 However, a maximum rate of up to 40 percent has been kept
 yah dar vittiya apaat sthiti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue rakhi gai he
 After GST is implemented, only three types of taxes will be levied on goods and services
 pehla sijisti, yani central jiesti, jo centre sarkaar vasuulegi
 The second SGST, ie State GST, which the state government will levy on its business
 teesraa hoga vah jo koi kaarobaar agar do rajyon ke bich hoga to us par ijiasti, yani integrated jiesti vasula jayega
 It will be recovered by the Central Government and it will be divided in equal proportion in both the states
 vishwa ke lagbhag 160 deshon main jiesti kii karadhaan vyavastha lagu he
 In India, the idea was introduced by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in the year 2000
 jaankaron kii raay main shuruaati teen saalon main jiesti mahangaai badhaane vaala tex sabit hoga, jaisaa malaysia or anya deshon ke udaahranon se spasht he
 From the production of any goods to the hands of the consumer, many types of taxes have been imposed till now
 is ek tex ke lagane se ye alag alag tarah ke tex samaapt ho jaaenge yaa yun kahen ki kisi vastu yaa seva ke aapke haathon tak pahunchane main lagane vaale vibhinn prakaar ke kar ab is kar ke bheetar hi samo liye jaaenge
 But it is not that it will cause any loss to traders or traders engaged in various stages
 is aakhir stage par lagane vaale tex main sabhi benifit samahit honge
 Obviously, this tax on goods and services will have different items on different goods and services
 aaie aapako bataaen ki iske tahat koun koun se tex aaenge or yah kis varg ke logon par kya asar daalega
 So let's first know about the various GST taxes which will include other taxes
 vartmaan main lagu ye tex aage chalakar jiesti main sammilit kar die jaaenge : Central Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duty, Service Tax, Additional Customs Duty, Additional Duty of Customs
 rajya str par maujuud ye tex jiesti main sammilit kar die jaanege : State VAT / Sales Tax, Entertainment Tax (other than taxes levied by local bodies), Central Sales Tax (one that is levied by the Center and levied by the States), octroi and entry tax, purchase tax, luxury tax, Tax on betting, lottery and gambling
 jiesti ko lagu karne ke baad isse jude sabhi staron par iskaa napha hoga
 Such as various related states, the central government, manufacturers and suppliers of goods and services, and the consumers present on the last phase of this chain will also get the benefit
 aaie ek najar main jaane ki kise kitna kis prakaar se phayda pahonchega : What will the business and the industry benefit from - GSTN means Goods and Services Tax Network (BGSTN) will boost the entire system of GST
 sabhi karadaataaon ke liye registration, riterns, pement aadi se judi sabhi sevaaon ko jiestn ke jariye praapt kiya ja sakegaa jisase jiesti kaa anupaalan zyada aasaan or paardarshee tareeke se ho sake
 There will be uniformity in tax rates and its structure
 jiesti yah sunishchit karegaa ki apratyaksh kar kii daren or dhaancha puure desh main kaaman ho
 In other words, GST will make doing business in the country tax neutral irrespective of the person doing business in any city or state
 aam aadmi ke liye jiesti alag tarah ke badlaav lekar aayega
 These include some things being expensive but some things being cheap
 choti kaaren, esayuvi, bike, paint or cement, movie tikat, bijli ke saamaan (pankhe, balb, water heater, air cooler), rozmarra kii zarurat ke saamaan, radimaid kapade, jiesti lagu ho jane ke baad inaki kharid sasti ho sakati he
 While commercial vehicles such as cigarettes, trucks, mobile phone calls, clothing, branded jewelery, rail, bus, air tickets can be expensive
 pehle paanch saal tak kaaron, sheetay peyon or tambaakoo utpaadon jaisi samagriyon par kuch anya kar bhi lagaae jaaenge, taaki rajyon ke nuksaan kii bharpai kii ja sake
 The Compensation Act has been framed in such a way as to make the constitutional promise made by the Central Government to compensate the revenue loss of the states on the implementation of GST
 tippaniyan Four rates in the GST regime - 5, 12, 18 and 28 percent - have been fixed
 haalanki, adhiktam 40 pratishat tak kii sheersh dar (top rate) rakhi gai he
 This rate is kept in view of financial emergency
 jiesti lagu hone ke baad vastuon evam sevaaon par keval teen tarah ke tex vasule jaaenge
 The first CGST, ie Central GST, which the central government will levy
 doosraa esgsti, yani state jiesti, jo rajya sarkaar apane yahaan hone vaale kaarobaar par vasuulegi
 Third, if any business is between two states, then IGST, ie Integrated GST will be charged
 ise centre sarkaar vasuul karegi or use donon rajyon main samaan anupaat main baant diya jayega
 GST taxation system is in force in about 160 countries of the world
 bharat main iskaa vichaar atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar dwaara saal 2000 main laayaa gaya
 In the opinion of experts, GST will prove to be an inflation-raising tax in the first three years, as is evident from the examples of Malaysia and other countries

 com / cchsei3l5l His half-century against Kings XI Punjab went in vain, but Rajasthan Royals young batsman Sanju Samson says he will overcome this and play the role of a good finisher in the upcoming matches
 samson ne 52 ran banaae, lekin glen maxwell ne 89 ran kii pari khelkar punjab ko 193 ran kaa lakshya dilaa diya
 Samson told the IPL website, the wicket was helpful to the batsmen and even after scoring 190 runs, the match was on par
 yah punjab kaa din tha jab sab kuch unke anukool rahaa
 "I always enjoy playing for Rajasthan Royals and i am happy that i was able to give a good score to the team, but even after playing so well, it is sad to lose
" unhone kaha, is saal main zyada se zyada maichon main finishr kii bhoomika nibhaana chahta hum
 i will play according to my strategy, which so far has given me success
 agar aap naukari pesha hai or kiraaye ke makaan par rahete hai to ye khabar aapke liye behad ahm hai
 Saving income tax through the HRA Exemption Claim will not be as easy as before
 ab aapako apane makaan maalik kaa pan detail bhi dena hoga
 However, this rule will not be applicable to income tax payers paying less than Rs 1 lakh per annum
 is sambandh main central board of diarect taxej (sibiditi) ne ek circular jari kiya he
 If your landlord does not have a PAN, he will have to give the declaration in this regard, in addition to this, the person filing the return will also have to give the details of his landlord's name and address
 aapako bataa den ki ab tak prati maah 15,000 rupee se kam kiraaya dene par makaan maalik ke pan kii jarurat nahin padati thi par nae niyam lagu hone ke saath yah chhot ghatakar 8,333 rupee prati maah par aa gai he
 This new rule of CBDT is being linked with the exercise to curb stealing tax
 kyonki kai ykardaata zyada se zyada phayda uthaane ke liye kiraaya badha-chadhaakar nakli raseed dete rahehain
 However, people of the industry believe that after the new rules are implemented, the difficulties of honest tax payers will also increase
 kyonki zyaadaatar maukon par makaan maalik apane pan detail dene main kotahi baratate hai

 0 Government started with signs of recession
 There are many negative news coming from the sector
 GDP growth in the quarter was just 5%
 Hatred war caused by economic recession in the world
 The Minister made several announcements to overcome the sluggishness
 0 sarkaar kii shuruyaat hi mandi ke sanketon se hui or iske 100 din puure hone par aarthik susti gaharaati hi ja rahi he
 Negative news is coming from every sector like auto sector, real estate, telecom, financial services, banking, steel, textile, tea, diamond
 utpaadan main katautee ho rahi he or naukariyon par kanchi chal rahi he
 Government and private spending is not increasing
 haal main aae june timahi ke liye jidipi growth kaa 5 fisadi kaa aankada chintaa ko or badhaata he
 The main reasons for the recent recession are the decline in domestic demand, decrease in investment, sluggishness in the auto sector, decline in manufacturing activities
 modi sarkaar ne agle 5 saal main desh kii arthvyavastha ko 5 trillian dollar tak pahunchane kaa lakshya rakhaa he, lekin jaankaron kaa kahana he ki 5 fisadi ke aasapaas kii jidipi par ise hasil karne asambhav jaisaa he
 For this, GDP growth of 8 to 9 percent per annum is required
 auto sector kii haalat behad kharabaarthik susti kii ek badi vajah desh ke auto sector kaa reverse gear main chalaa janaa he
 The decline in sales of cars and other vehicles continued for the 10th consecutive month in August
 agast main kaaron kii bikri main 29 fisadi kii baari giravat ai he
 More than three and a half lakh employees associated with the auto sector have lost their jobs and about 1 million jobs are in danger
 textile-spinning sector kii haalat bhi kharabkrishi kshetra ke baad sabase zyada 10 karod logon ko rojgaar dene vaale textile sector kii bhi haalat kharaab he
 According to the Northern India Textile Mills Association, Indian yarn is no longer competitive in the global market due to state and central GST and other taxes
 april se june kii timahi main coton yarn ke niryaat main saal-dar-saal 34
 There has been a decline of 6 percent
 june main to isamen 50 fisadi tak kii giravat aa chuki he
 The real estate sector is constantly in a similar situation in the real estate sector, which has been in bad shape for the past several years
 march 2019 tak bharat ke 30 bade shaharon main 12 lakh 80 hazaar makaan banakar taiyaar hai lekin unke kharidaar nahin mil rahe
 That is, people are not buying at the speed at which builders are building houses

 8 percent which is the lowest in the last 5 years
 is vitt varsh kii june timahi main to jidipi growth ludhakkar 5 fisadi par aa gai he
 In view of the situation, RBI has reduced the growth rate for the year 2019-20 to 6
 9 fisadi kar diya he
 GST was implemented in 2017 under the tax reforms of the GST on GDP
 tab ise desh ke tex system ke itihaas kaa ek bada riform maanakar pesh kiya gaya tha
 Many changes were also made to it in later years
 lekin jis riform ko sarkaar apni aamadani kaa jariya maan rahi thi usase aamadani kam hoti ja rahi he
 In the data released by the revenue department, it was found that in the month of August, the GST collection has again been down by Rs
 july 2019 main yah raashi ek lakh karod rupee rahi thi
 Disenchanted by foreign institutional investors, investors had high hopes in the second term of the Modi government
 in ummiido par pani phir gaya jab sarkaar ne apane bajet main videshi portpholio niveshkon par sarcharge lagane kaa faisla kiya
 This scared foreign investors so much that they started withdrawing their money even before this proposal came into force
 banking or enbiensi main nakadi sankatbank or enbiensi (gaiyr-banking vittiya companiyon) dwaara vanijyik kshetra ko diye jane vaale karj main baari giravat darj kii gai
 The financial sector crisis was further aggravated due to irregularities in IL&FS, due to which the sector had to face cash problems
 nakadi nahin mil paane ke kaaran log ghar kharid, vaahan kharid nahin kar paae or na hi nae kaarobaar ko khol sake
 Due to these signs of recession, according to the recently released data by RBI, the loans given by banks to industries have come down
 petroleum, khanan, textile, fertilizer or telecom jaise sectors ne karj lenaa kam kar diya he
 5 in gold and silver imports in the quarter from April to June 2019
 3 fisadi kii kami ai he
 While in the same period last year 6
 3 fisadi kii badhat dekhi gai thi
 External factors of the slowdown: The rising prices of crude oil in the international market has had an impact on inflation
 america or china ke bich jari trade war kii vajah se bhi duniya main aarthik mandi kaa khatra teji se bad rahaa he, jiskaa asar bharat par bhi padaa he
 The rupee has depreciated against the dollar
 aayaat ke mukaable niryaat main badhat na ho paane kii vajah se desh kaa rajkoshiya ghaataa badha he or videshi mudra bhandar main kami ai he
 The threat of economic slowdown in the world is increasing due to the ongoing trade war between the US and China
 in donon mahashaktiyon ke bich ho rahi kaarobaari jang ne kai chote deshon ko mushkil main daal diya he, isse niveshkon ke saath hi companiyon main bhi ghabrahat kaa maahaul dikhaai de rahaa he
 How will the situation improve? Experts say that the economy can be brought back on track only when the government reforms taxes, improves revenue, takes steps to increase people's demand
 vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne bazaar main ai susti ko dur karne or arthvyavastha ko durust karne ke liye haal main alag-alag sectors, udyog or aam aadmi ko mandi se raahat dene ke liye kai elaan kiye hai, lekin inkaa kitna asar hota he yah kuch maheenon ke baad hi pataa chalegaa

 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko bheje gaye shok sandesh main china ke videsh mantri wang yi ne jor dete hue kaha he ki aatankwaad maanav jati kaa saamaanya dushman he or china har tarah ke aatankwaad kaa majbootee se virodh karata he or isaki kadi ninda karata he

 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko shuukravaar ko bheje apane shok sandesh main yi ne kaha ki jab unhen pataa chalaa ki kashmir main ek fidaayin hamalaa kiya gaya he or isse baari sankhya main suraksha karmi hataahat hue hai to vah stabdh rah gaye
 Expressing condolences to the families of the martyrs, Yi said, 'the countries of the region should increase cooperation and jointly deal with the menace of terrorism and maintain the peace and security of the region
 ' darasal, bharat kah chukaa he ki hamaare paas pulavama hamale main pakistan ke haath hone ke aise saboot hai, jis par koi vivaad nahin ho saktaa
 However, the Pakistan government has denied India's allegations
 pakistan ne kaha he ki ‘ham bina kisi jaanch ke hamale kaa sambandh pakistan se jodne ke bhartiya media or sarkaar ke kisi bhi akshep ko khaarij karte he'
 The Pakistan government said in a statement that the attack in Pulwama in Kashmir was "a matter of grave concern"
 pulavama hamale ke baad suraksha maamalon kii cabinet samiti ke faisle main bharat sarkaar ne pakistan se 'most faverd nesan' (MFN) kaa darja chin liya he

 The possibility of theft of 32 lakh ATM pins is not common
 report ke mutabik mailaware vaale atm mashin se paise nikaalane kii vajah se ye pin chori hue hai
 Only the pins have been stolen or even more information is not clear
 jin bainkon ke customers ke data chori hue hai unamem SBI, echdiefasi, isiaisiai, yes bank or exis bank shaamil hai
 However, no bank has yet told what the whole issue is
 bada sawaal yah he ki kya khatarnaak havers ne atm mashin main ek ek karke send maari he? kya tamaam atm cards ke data chori ho gaye hai yaa phir mailaware injection ke jariye atm mashin se sabhi debit cards kaa clon bana liya gaya he
 We tell you about malware how it works and how it can blow up ATM data
 mailaware darasal ek khatarnaak script hoti he jisamen aise program likhe hote hai jinke jariye system main rakhaa data churaane or use barbaad karne ke makasad se banaaya jaataa he
 It is injected into the server via an attachment or removable drive
 jaahir havers ne esbiai ke atm network ke sarwar main ise inject kiya hoga
 Because the software of atms are interconnected
 ek baar ise sarwar main daal diya jaae to ise ran karne ke liye kai baar remote acces kii jarurat hoti lekin kai baar ye khud se bhi actevet ho jate hai
 Once activated, important data from the system begins to be passed on to hackers
 jaahir he agar aisa hua hoga to na sirf atm pin balki card kii duusari jaankariyaan jaise card number bhi havers ke paas gaye honge
 How to break? The software of SBI or other bank atms are interconnected and also very secure
 ek haikar ne hamase bataaya he ki,' havers ne sambhawatah open network ke jariye hi send lagaai he
 Because they don't have to work too hard for this
 kai baar laaparvaahee kii vajah se network open chhot jate hai
 Through the malware, the details of the cards used in these ATM networks are available to the hackers
 haalanki card detel milane ke baad bhi kisi debit card se paise uda paanaa aasaan nahin hota, kyonki ab pement getwe main iske liye yaa to otipi kii zarurat hoti he yaa 3di sicyor code kii
 But hackers also have its cut
 pehle wo card kaa clon taiyaar karte hai, iske baad us card par churaae gaye data applai karte hai
 It is not 100 per cent, but it is easy for hackers to make money with huge cards
 britain kii uniwarsity main 700 videshi students ko newclear, boylogical or chemical warfare jaise vishyon main admician dene se manaa kar diya he

 Courtesy: Newsflicks aamir khan kii film sikret superstar 19 oktober ko relies hone vaali he
 It stars Dangal girl Zaira Wasim in the lead role
 vaise to aamir is film main chemiyo role kar rahe hai, lekin unhone ise apane ab tak ke kariyar kaa sabase mushkil role bataaya he
 Even all his roles surprise the audience and then the box office success of his films
 magar aamir is saxes kaa kaaran khud ko nahin maanate
 The reasons he gives behind this are quite interesting
 website inuth se baatcheet main aamir ne kaha ki unki filmon ke hit hone ke peeche wo nahin, balki film ke riter or diarector hai
 Aamir says, "it's just good work that makes someone a star
" jab koi film acchhee banati he, tabhi star kaa janm hota he
 Being a star does not work
 main kabhi nahin kah saktaa ki meri vajah se koi film safal hui he
 Aamir says that if you look at PK or Dangal or Three Idiots, what could have happened because of me was in the first week of the film's release, but even after that, the film ran because the film was good
 star sirf shuruaati teen din kaa collection laate hai, baaki film riter or diarector ke boote chalati he
 PK and Dangal made me, i did not make PK and Dangal
 'thags of hindustaan' ke liye aamir kii fees jaanakar hairaan rah jaaenge aapamir is baat ko bhi nahin maanate ki unki vajah se film chalati he
 He told, "people say that movies go on because of me, but if films were not there, i would not have been able to make anything
" main khud sochataa hum ki agar lagaan, 3 edinuts, taare jameen par jaisi filmein nahin hotin, to meraa kariyar kahaan hota
 My career is due to these films
 ''bathroom main suni 3 edinuts kii scryptstaradam ke bare main aamir kaa kahana he, ''mujhe nahin lagata ki main superstar hum
 i don't take stardom too serially
 '' unhone bataaya ki kiran unhen dhobi ghat film main nahin lenaa chaahati thi, kyonki unhen lagata tha ki aamir superstar hai
 He was worried it would be difficult to shoot with Aamir at a common location
 aamir ne unhen bahut mushkil se manaaya tha
 For this, he had really left the star life
 film main wo jis ghar main rahete dikhte hai, unhone shooting se pehle hi vahaan rahanaa shuru kar diya tha
 The house was in a very crowded area of mumbai
 aamir puure teen hafte tak yaheen rahe
 It was here that he also met Rajkumar Hirani
 3 edinuts kii script bhi unhone yaheen suni thi
 Aamir told that while narrating the script, Hirani was sitting in the bathtub and he was in the bathroom
 aamir khan kaa khulaasa, is film main kiya kariyar kaa sabase mushkil role'amitabh ke staradam ko nahin doharaaya ja saktaa'aamir apni agali film thags of hindustaan main big bi ke saath najar aaenge
 He describes his experience working with him as quite fun
 aamir kaa kahana he ki amitabh ke staradam ko doharaaya nahin ja saktaa
 Their magic is different
 unhone bataaya ki ek jamaana tha jab amitabh kii chah se saat filmein ek saath theatre main chal rahi hoti thim
 'don', 'muqaddar Ka Sikander' and 'parvarish' were released in the same year
 unki takkar aksar khud se hi hua karti thi
 Some things do not change in any government
 agar suraksha agency kaa koi jawan yaa adhikari kabhi bhi netaa yaa unke samarthakon ko kanoon todane se roktaa he tab gaaj usee par girti he
 One such example was seen at Patna Airport where supporters of Union Minister Giriraj Singh shouted at CISF personnel engaged in security work
 ghatana ke sisitivi footage main saaf dikhataa he ki mantri ke samarthak javaanon ke saath jabardastee kar rahe hai
 But the action came against Patna Airport's CISF commandant Dharamvir Yadav
 yadav kaa tabadalaa amritsar kar diya gaya he or unki jagah vishaal dube ko bheja gaya he
 This transfer was done so quickly that both the officers were also ordered to join their new place of transfer immediately
 haalanki 6 sitambar ko jab singh kendriya mantrimandal main apane vibhaagon kii sankhya main badhotaree ke baad pehali baar aa rahe the tab unke samarthakon ko 22 free paas die gaye the lekin jahaan se yatri patna airport se nikalate hai, us raste ko singh ke samarthakon ne jam kiya hua tha
 On this, the security agency's soldiers were heard and then there was a lot of scuffle
 is maamle kii shikaayat bhi siaisef ne kii thi
 The comments giriraaj singh kuch varsh purv patna airport ke tatkaaleen nideshak atul dikshit ke khilaaf visheshadhikaar kaa prastaav laaye the or tab dikshit kaa tabadalaa kolkata airport par kar diya gaya tha
 But certainly the morale of security personnel is likely to be adversely affected after the latest developments
 siaisef ke adhikari ise niyamit sthanantaran bataa rahe hai
 But BJP leaders also believe that the message will not be corrected by such quick and fast officers who have been instructed to join
 giriraaj singh se sampark karne par unase is sambandh main baatcheet nahin ho paayi
 However, on September 6, when Singh was coming for the first time after increasing the number of his portfolios in the Union Cabinet, his supporters were given 22 free passes, but from where passengers leave Patna Airport, the road was jammed by Singh's supporters
 Was done isapar pehle suraksha agency ke javaanon se kahasuni hui or phir baad main hathapayee kii naubat aa gayi
 The case was also reported by the CISF
 tippaniyan Giriraj Singh had proposed a privilege some years ago against the then director of Patna Airport, Atul Dixit, and then Dixit was transferred to Kolkata Airport
 lekin nishchit rup se taaja ghatnakram ke baad suraksha karmiyon ke manobal par pratikul asar padane kii sambhaavna he
 The CISF officials are describing it as a regular transfer
 lekin bijepi ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki itani jaldi or jis teji se adhikariyon ko jwine karne kaa nirdesh hua he usase sandesh shayad thik nahin jayega
 After contacting Giriraj Singh, there was no communication in this regard

 The ruling United Progressive Alliance (UPA) at the Center hopes that the all-party meeting will end the impasse in Parliament on the issue of foreign direct investment (FADI) in retail
 mukhya vipakshi dal bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) evam marxvaadi communist party (makapa) multi brands khudara kshetra main epadiai ke mudde par sansad main charchaa evam matdaan karaane kii maang kar rahi hai
 The BJP and the CPI-M have stalled the proceedings of Parliament on this demand
 sansad kaa sheetakaaleen satr 22 navambar ko shuru hua
 But the government is only ready for discussion
 sansadeey kaarymantri kamalnath ne sansad main gatirodh khatm karne ke liye sarvadaleey baithak bulaai he
 Leader of the Lok Sabha and Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said after the Congress core group meeting on Friday, "the government is ready to discuss FDI but not with voting
" ham gatirodh khatm karne ke liye prayaas kar rahe hai
 " sansadeey kaarymantri kaa kaarybhaar sambhaalane ke baad camel nath ke liye vipakshi dalon ko manaanaa pehali pariksha he
 According to sources, there is no threat to the government even if the vote on FDI is lost in the division but it will be seen as a political embarrassment

 The main opposition parties Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Marxist Communist Party (CPI-M) are demanding a discussion and voting in Parliament on the issue of FDI in multi-brand retail
 bhaajapa evam makapa ne is maang ko lekar sansad kii kaarywahi thap kar rakhi he
 The winter session of Parliament began on 22 November
 lekin sarkaar sirf charchaa karaane ke liye hi taiyaar he
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath has called an all-party meeting to end the deadlock in Parliament
 loksabhaa ke netaa evam kendriya grahamantri susheel kumaar scindia ne shuukravaar ko congress kii kor group kii baithak ke baad kaha tha, "sarkaar epadiai par charchaa ke liye taiyaar he lekin matdaan ke saath nahin
 We are trying to end the deadlock
 " After assuming the charge of Parliamentary Affairs Minister, it is the first test for Kamal Nath to convince opposition parties
 sutron ke anusaar epadiai par mat vibhaajan main haarane par bhi sarkaar ko koi khatra nahin he lekin ise raajnneetik sharmindagi ke taur par dekha jayega
 Earlier, Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati, who were supporting the central government from outside, had met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh earlier this month and assured him of support
 tippaniyan Mulayam Singh opposes FDI in multibrand retail and his party may be absent from the House at the time of division

 -input language deraa sachcha sauda ke pramukh or rape ke maamle main doshi sabit ram rahim ko court ne 20 saal kii sashram sajaa sunai he
 He will be imprisoned in Rohtak jail
 is prakaar aisa lagata he ki ram rahim ke jivan kaa ant jail kii charadivari main hi ho jayega or court ne use sudharkar dobaaraa jivan shuru karne kaa koi mauka nahin diya he
 But the kind of super talent that his disciples claim to be inside Ram Rahim and the way he has been presented as super human, if he shows his tithes and social concerns in jail, then he will save the rest of his life
 Can also bring some changes in the lives of prisoners
 haalanki, ram rahim ne jis tarah kaa aparaadh kiya he usase tamaam tarah ke jaghanya aparaadh karne vaale kaidiyon ke bich bhi uske liye sammaan hasil karnaa aasaan nahin hoga, lekin jis tarah se usne sabhi dharmon main apni sweekaaryata banaai thi, use dekhte hue yah kah sakate hai ki uske paas yah mauka he ki vah ab kuch vastav main satkarm kar apana baaki jivan sudhaar sake
 Not one or two, dozens of skills are claimed to be the talent inside Rahim, which obviously cannot be in a human being, the kind of aura he created about the way he preached about himself
 usne vastav main uske shishyon ke liye use bhagwaan jaisaa maanane ko majaboor kar diya
 According to the Dera Sacha Sauda Sanstha, the so-called saint Gurmeet Ram Rahim was filled with talent within the body
 deraa sachcha sauda kaa kaa daawa he ki usne 5 karod se zyada logon ko muft main medishan sikhaaya he
 It is claimed that millions of people have come to know about the real purpose and possibility of their lives with the unique medicine of Ram Rahim
 to ab jail ke ekaaki jivan main ram rahim ab aatmachintan karne or unic medishan ke dwaara apane jivan main badlaav laane kii koshish kar saktaa he or iske baad jail ke baaki kaidiyon ko bhi apni is dhyaan kii sikh dekar vah unako jivan kaa vaastavik uddeshy jaanane main madad kar saktaa he
 kasi-kasi Pratibidera According to Sacha Sauda, ram Rahim enjoys excellent photography, he has mastered everything from music to engineering, sports to agriculture
 vah lekhak, avishkaarak, athlete, kai bhashaaon kaa vaktaa, vidwaan, scientist, thiologist, sangeetkaar or maanavtaavaadi he
 Ram Rahim is claimed to be an expert in 32 sports
 inamen bollyboul, net ball, thro ball, kabddi, lon tennis, cricket, footbal, billiard jaise khel shaamil hai
 He is described as a Wonderful Healer
 daawey ke mutabik use ayurveda, yoga, asana aadi kii bhi acchhee jaankaree he
 He is also being described as a specialist psychologist, counselor
 uske kavi, geetkaar hone or tamaam kitabon, sahitya kaa rachayita bataaya ja rahaa he
 He is said to have knowledge of many languages
 uske skild rellyist or auto diziner bhi hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa he
 According to the claim, he is a better athlete
 rock, sufi, punjabi, fok jaise tamaam geeton par uske samaan adhikaar kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 According to the organization, he is a universal designer
 faishal diziner, magazine diziner, interior diziner, exterior diziner or na jane kis-kis cheez kaa diziner
 
 
 Ram Rahim has been described as a magician turning barren land into green fertile fields
 use poudharopan or iko friendli kheti kaa ustad bataaya jaataa he
 He is described as an excellent chef, nutritionist and a social reformer
 ram rahim kaa deraa kai tarah ke jan kalyaan kaaryon ko sanchalit karne kaa daawa karata rahaa he
 One of these is a campaign to keep youth away from drugs
 baba ne yuvaaon ko sahi raah dikhaane ke liye rock star kaa rup dhaaran kiya
 She performed many concerts like many rock stars
 baad main usne kai filmein bhi kii
 The Messenger of God is the chief among them
 daawey ke mutabik usne film main khud kahani likhi, diarection kiya or gane gaae
 He is seen to have eliminated wrongdoers in his films
 sochie ek vyakti main kahin itani pratibha honi sambhav he
 But we assume that the dozens of talents that are claimed to be inside Ram Rahim will have some part in him, then he will have the chance to use it to become a good prisoner
 vah ek aadhyatmik sant hone kaa daawa karata he to uske bheetar agar vastav main aadhyatmikta kaa ansh maatr bhi hoga to vah isse jail ke kaidiyon ke jivan ko badal saktaa he
 Using his talent, he can teach all the languages, skills, sports to the prisoners in the jail
 vah sangeet, yoga, aadhyatm, meditation ke dwaara kaidiyon ke jivan main bada badlaav laa saktaa he
 Now it will have to be seen whether Ram Rahim's going to jail brings good days for the prisoners

 Pawan Kumar is the labor enforcement officer of Ranchi
 aap naagarik or ham patrkaar bhi shram adhikari ke kaam or adhikaar ke daayre ke bare main kam jaankaree rakhte hai
 So despite his apprehensions, Pawan kept listening to Kumar's words carefully
 ek adhikari kyon kisi patrkaar ke paas apane aansu roega? main tivi par dikhaa bhi duungaa to pawan kumaar kaa apana koun sa aisa agenda puraa ho jayega jisase ve ek story ke baad shram mantri ke taur par shapath le lenge
 Listening to the words of Pawan shirked what would happen to the common laborers
 shram mantralay ke in karyaalayon main kis tarah kaa nexs bana hua he kya ham jaanate bhi hai? tamaam shram adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ke ghar chaape maare jaaen to mazaduron kii paseene kii kamai kaa kitna bada khazaana nikal saktaa he
 Let me first tell the work of Pawan Kumar
 inkaa kaam he companiyon ke record check karnaa taaki mazdoor ko nunatam mazaduri mili or ritair hote hi company gracuty kii puri raqam kaa samay par bhugtan kare
 If a labor officer starts ensuring this, then how much praise would be given to any government
 magar sarkaar kaa tantra hi iske kilaaf ho to aap raveesh kumaar jaise zero reating vaale patrakaron ke paas apana dukhada rokar kya kar lenge
 Will the society or the readership stand for such officers
 nahin hoga
 Pawan Kumar started his work and started writing on file every day against companies and organizations that contract labor
 aapatti uthaane lage
 Their objections can be judged
 nateeja yah hua ki sab kilaaf ho gaye kyonki aisa karne se mazaduron ko haq milane laga
 Crying, Pawan said that i am not afraid of transfer or suspension
 maine mazaduron kii bhalaai ke liye eemaandaaree se kaam kiya he
 No one can sack me and dismiss me
 main un aaropon ko nazarandaaz kar aaraam se us jagah par ja saktaa hum jahaan meraa tabadalaa hua he
 Pawan talks that he has met companies from his office peon to colleague and senior
 ve chapa maarane nikalate hai, chaparasi or clerk soochna de dete hai
 In his absence, Lok Adalat is set up and the grievances are disposed of in favor of companies, whereas without Adalat Labor Officer, Lok Adalat cannot be held
 teen may ko kshetreey shram ayukta karyaalay ke karmchaariyon ne un par jaanaleva hamalaa kar diya
 In this evidence, he continued to show all the reports from the medical report
 kitni bhayanak baat he ki karmchaaree apane varisht afasar kii gardan marod den
 He was transferred on Pawan's complaint
 is jagah par ve kai saal se jame hue the
 Now the transfer has stopped again
 pawan ne jab marpet kii ghatana ke khilaaf police main praathmiki darj karai to badale main bhaajapa ke sthaneey netaa ne inke kilaaf karmchaariyon ke saath marpet karne kaa maamla darj kara diya
 Why will BJP leaders file a case? If there was an incident of assault, the employees could have got it done
 pawan ke khilaaf bhartiya mazdoor sangh se jude bihar minerals mazdoor sanghathan (lohardaga) ne bhi shikaayat kii he ki pawan kumaar hindalco khan kshetra main bahari vyakti lekar gum rahe the or union banane kaa prayaas kar rahe the
 Colleagues also filed cases under the STSC Act and made complaints to companies
 jis company ne shikaayat kii he uske kilaaf pawan ne gracuty bhugtan ke ulanghan ke do karod rupee se zyaada ke maamle ujagar kiye the
 Pawan's side was not even heard and the entire file was destroyed
 ek or company kii chori ke maamle kii fil bhi gaayab kar di gai
 All these are Pawan Kumar's own side but the way the leaders of political parties are involved in this, it shows how many cars are running from this department's oil
 pawan se baat kar laga ki companiyaan bade paimaane par nunatam mazaduri kii chori kar rahi hai
 There is no minimum wage anywhere in the state
 aisa duusare rajyon main bhi ho rahaa hoga
 The labor enforcement officer investigating the case can face a penalty of zero to ten times
 agar kisi company ne kisi mazdoor ko nunatam mazaduri ke das hazaar rupee nahin diye to shram pravartan adhikari das guna tak yani ek lakh tak kaa jurmaana laga saktaa he magar zyaadaatar maamalon main paanch sau rupaye se adhik kaa jurmaana nahin lagaaya jaataa
 The Prime Minister can order to publish the list of all the penalties on the website
 isi tarah mazaduron kii gracuty kii chori kaa kissa sunakar saham gaya
 If all this is true then how dreadful is the situation
 yahi nahin bina prashikshan or suraksha ke mazaduron se visphotak saamagree kii dhulaai karai jaati he
 Pawan has made his complaint from the Ministry of Labor to the Prime Minister's Office
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne use waapas shram mantralay main bhej diya or maamla vahiin pahunchaa jinke kilaaf shikaayat kii gai thi
 According to Pawan, the Ministry of Labor has done a probe in the matter
 pawan ne bataaya ki ve ab fasebuk par khulkar likhane lage hai
 a press conference was also held in Delhi in which Kanhaiya Kumar also attended
 pawan je en you se padhe hue hai
 His words reflect the idealism which our politics defeats in the end
 tarah tarah ke aarope lagaakar bharamaane kaa khel shuru hota he or aise adhikari ke manobal ko tod diya jaataa he
 Pawan's story is not just about an officer
 ek tantra kii he jo companiyon se milakar mazaduron ko lut rahaa he
 This story tells that the labor movement has also rotted from within
 wo baahar se mazaduron ke hit kii baat karata he, andar andar companiyon se haath mila letaa he
 i wrote this story after talking to Pawan
 or paksh ho sakate hai par aap jaanate hai ki sarkari paksh ke log itani aasaani se baat nahin karte
 Who can deny the cycle of exploitation and plunder from this story to a great extent
 tippaniyan Listening to Pawan Kumar, he felt how lonely one gets because of his honesty
 satta or samaaj donon use haashiye par dhakel dete hai
 Only the corrupt part of society claims morality and loots the debate
 jo eemaandaar hota he wo akelaa rah jaataa he
 Photocopies of documents begin to be collected, kept in the bag in the hope that some change will happen if a journalist exposes these things
 main apni ashankaon ke giraft main baitha rahaa, pawan yah kah kar jane lage ki ek din duniya badalegi
 Pawan started drawing my picture for his mother and i started thinking about you readers, really, after reading this story it seems that the world will change! i recognize you readers well
 pawan kumaar shaayad aapako nahin jaanate isiilie ek patrkaar ke paas ummiido kaa bag kandhe par lad kar chale aae the
 Do not send me the files of your agony by reading this story
 pawan kumaar kii tarah apni ladaai akele laden
 i can't fight pawan kumaar ranchi ke shram pravartan adhikari hai
 You citizens and we journalists are also less aware of the scope of work and authority of labor officer
 isliye apni ashankaon ke baad bhi pawan kumaar kii baton ko gaur se sunata rahaa
 Why would an officer cry tears to a journalist? Even if i show it on TV, then Pawan Kumar's own agenda will be fulfilled by which he will take oath as the Labor Minister after a story
 pawan kii baton ko sunate hue siharataa rahaa ki aam mazaduron ke saath kya kya hota hoga
 What kind of Nexus is made in these offices of Labor Ministry, do we know? If a raid is conducted on the houses of all the labor officers and employees, then how much money can be made out of the sweat earnings of the workers
 pehle pawan kumaar kaa kaam bataata hum
 Their job is to check the records of the companies so that the laborers get minimum wages and on retirement, the company pays the entire amount of gratuity on time
 agar koi shram adhikari ye sunishchit karaane lage to kisi bhi sarkaar kii kitni prashansa hogi
 But if the government machinery is against it, then what will you do by crying your grief to journalists with zero rating like Ravish Kumar
 kya samaaj yaa pathak varg aise afasaron ke liye khadaa hoga
 Will not done
 pawan kumaar ne apana kaam karnaa shuru kiya or har din fil par companiyon or contract par lebar rakhane vaale sanghathanon ke kilaaf likhane lage
 Started raising objections unki aapattiyon kii nyaayik jaanch kii ja sakati he
 The result was that all became against them because by doing this the workers started getting their rights
 rote rote pawan ne kaha ki main tabadalaa yaa nilamban se nahin darataa
 i have worked honestly for the good of the workers
 mujhe koi barkhaast karke nahin jhukaa saktaa
 i can easily ignore those allegations and go to the place where i have been transferred
 pawan kii baton se laga ki unke daftar ke chaparasi se lekar sahakarmi or varisht tak companiyon se mili hue hai
 They go out to raid, the peon and the clerk inform
 unki anupasthiti main lok adaalat lagaakar shikayaton kaa companiyon ke paksh main nipataara kar dete hai jabaki shram pravartan adhikari ke bagair lok adaalat lag hi nahin sakati
 On May 3, he was attacked by the employees of the Regional Labor Commissioner office
 iske saboot main ve medical report se lekar tamaam report dikhaate rahe
 What a terrible thing that employees wring the neck of their senior officer
 pawan kii shikaayat par inkaa tabadalaa hua tha
 They were frozen at this place for many years
 ab tabadalaa phir se ruk gaya he
 When Pawan filed an FIR with the police against the incident of assault, the local BJP leader in return filed a case against him for assaulting the employees
 bhaajapa netaa kyon maamla darj karaayenge? marpet kii ghatana hui he to karmchaaree kara sakate the
 The Bihar Minerals Workers Organization (lohardaga), associated with the Indian Workers Union, has also complained against Pawan that Pawan Kumar was roaming with Hindalco mine outsiders and trying to form a union
 sahakarmiyon ne bhi es tii es si act ke tahat muqadame darj karaaye or companiyon se shikaayatein karain
 Pawan had reported more than two crore cases of gratuity payment violation against the company who complained
 pawan kaa paksh suna tak nahin gaya or wo puri fil nasht kar di gai
 Another company's theft case file was also disappeared
 ye sab pawan kumaar ke apane paksh hai lekin jis tarah se isamen raajnneetik dalon ke netaa shaamil he usase pataa chalata he ki is vibhaag ke tel se kitnon kii gaadi daud rahi he
 Talking to Pawan that companies are stealing minimum wages on a large scale
 rajya main kahin bhi nunatam mazaduri nahin di ja rahi he
 This will be happening in other states also
 shram pravartan adhikari maamle kii jaanch kar shunya se das guna tak jurmaana laga saktaa he
 If a company has not paid ten thousand rupees of minimum wages to a worker, then the labor enforcement officer can impose a fine up to ten times i
e
 up to one lakh but in most cases not more than five hundred rupees
 pradhanmantri tamaam jurmaanon kii suchi website par prakashit karne ke aadesh de sakate hai
 Similarly, hearing about the theft of gratuity of the workers, i was stunned
 agar ye sab sach he to sthiti kitni bhayaavah he
 Not only this, without training and safety, the workers are transported explosive material
 pawan ne apni shikaayat shram mantralay se lekar pradhanmantri karyaalay se bhi kii he
 The Prime Minister's Office sent him back to the Ministry of Labor and the matter reached there, against whom a complaint was made
 pawan ke anusaar shram mantralay ne jaanch kar maamle main lipapoti hi kii he
 Pawan told that he has now started writing freely on Facebook
 dilli main ek press conference bhi kiya tha jisamen kanhaiya kumaar bhi shaamil hue the
 Pawan is studying from JNU
 unki baton main wo adarshavaad jhalkata he jise hamaari raajnneeti ant main haraa hi detii he
 The game of misleading starts by making various allegations and the morale of such officer is broken
 pawan kii kahani sirf ek afasar kii nahin he
 There is a system which is robbing the workers by joining the companies
 yah kahani bataati he ki shram andolan bhi bheetar se sad gaya he
 He talks about the interest of the workers from outside, inside joins hands with companies
 maine yah kahani pawan se baat karke likhi he
 There may be more sides, but you know that people on the government side do not talk so easily
 is kahani se shoshan or lut kaa jo chakra saamne aata he usase bahut had tak koun inkaar kar sakegaa
 The comments pawan kumaar ko sunate hue yahi laga ki koi apni eemaandaaree ke kaaran kitna akelaa ho jaataa he
 Both power and society marginalize him
 samaaj kaa bhrasht hissaa hi naitikta kaa daawa kar letaa he or bahes lut le jaataa he
 One who is honest remains alone
 dastavezon kii photocopy jamaa karne lagata he, bag main sambhaal kar rakhane lagata he is ummid main ki koi patrkaar in baton ko saamne laaegaa to kuch badlaav hoga
 i sat under my apprehensions, Pawan started saying that one day the world will change
 pawan apni maa ke liye meri tasviir khinchne lage or main aap pathakon ke bare main sochane laga ki kya vaaqai is kahani ko padhakar lagata he ki duniya badalegi! main aap pathakon ko acchhee tarah se pahachaanata hum
 Pawan Kumar may not know you, that's why a journalist came with a bag of expectations on his shoulder
 is kahani ko padhakar mujhe apni vyathaa kii filein na bhejein
 Fight your battle alone like Pawan Kumar
 main nahin lard saktaa
 Let me first tell the work of Pawan Kumar
 inkaa kaam he companiyon ke record check karnaa taaki mazdoor ko nunatam mazaduri mili or ritair hote hi company gracuty kii puri raqam kaa samay par bhugtan kare
 If a labor officer starts ensuring this, then how much praise would be given to any government
 magar sarkaar kaa tantra hi iske kilaaf ho to aap raveesh kumaar jaise zero reating vaale patrakaron ke paas apana dukhada rokar kya kar lenge
 Will the society or the readership stand for such officers
 nahin hoga
 Pawan Kumar started his work and started writing on file every day against companies and organizations that contract labor
 aapatti uthaane lage
 Their objections can be judged
 nateeja yah hua ki sab kilaaf ho gaye kyonki aisa karne se mazaduron ko haq milane laga
 Crying, Pawan said that i am not afraid of transfer or suspension
 maine mazaduron kii bhalaai ke liye eemaandaaree se kaam kiya he
 No one can sack me and dismiss me
 main un aaropon ko nazarandaaz kar aaraam se us jagah par ja saktaa hum jahaan meraa tabadalaa hua he
 Pawan talks that he has met companies from his office peon to colleague and senior
 ve chapa maarane nikalate hai, chaparasi or clerk soochna de dete hai
 In his absence, Lok Adalat is set up and the grievances are disposed of in favor of companies, whereas without Adalat Labor Officer, Lok Adalat cannot be held
 teen may ko kshetreey shram ayukta karyaalay ke karmchaariyon ne un par jaanaleva hamalaa kar diya
 In this evidence, he continued to show all the reports from the medical report
 kitni bhayanak baat he ki karmchaaree apane varisht afasar kii gardan marod den
 He was transferred on Pawan's complaint
 is jagah par ve kai saal se jame hue the
 Now the transfer has stopped again
 pawan ne jab marpet kii ghatana ke khilaaf police main praathmiki darj karai to badale main bhaajapa ke sthaneey netaa ne inke kilaaf karmchaariyon ke saath marpet karne kaa maamla darj kara diya
 Why will BJP leaders file a case? If there was an incident of assault, the employees could have got it done
 pawan ke khilaaf bhartiya mazdoor sangh se jude bihar minerals mazdoor sanghathan (lohardaga) ne bhi shikaayat kii he ki pawan kumaar hindalco khan kshetra main bahari vyakti lekar gum rahe the or union banane kaa prayaas kar rahe the
 Colleagues also filed cases under the STSC Act and made complaints to companies
 jis company ne shikaayat kii he uske kilaaf pawan ne gracuty bhugtan ke ulanghan ke do karod rupee se zyaada ke maamle ujagar kiye the
 Pawan's side was not even heard and the entire file was destroyed
 ek or company kii chori ke maamle kii fil bhi gaayab kar di gai
 All these are Pawan Kumar's own side but the way the leaders of political parties are involved in this, it shows how many cars are running from this department's oil
 pawan se baat kar laga ki companiyaan bade paimaane par nunatam mazaduri kii chori kar rahi hai
 There is no minimum wage anywhere in the state
 aisa duusare rajyon main bhi ho rahaa hoga
 The labor enforcement officer investigating the case can face a penalty of zero to ten times
 agar kisi company ne kisi mazdoor ko nunatam mazaduri ke das hazaar rupee nahin diye to shram pravartan adhikari das guna tak yani ek lakh tak kaa jurmaana laga saktaa he magar zyaadaatar maamalon main paanch sau rupaye se adhik kaa jurmaana nahin lagaaya jaataa
 The Prime Minister can order to publish the list of all the penalties on the website
 isi tarah mazaduron kii gracuty kii chori kaa kissa sunakar saham gaya
 If all this is true then how dreadful is the situation
 yahi nahin bina prashikshan or suraksha ke mazaduron se visphotak saamagree kii dhulaai karai jaati he
 Pawan has made his complaint from the Ministry of Labor to the Prime Minister's Office
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne use waapas shram mantralay main bhej diya or maamla vahiin pahunchaa jinke kilaaf shikaayat kii gai thi
 According to Pawan, the Ministry of Labor has done a probe in the matter
 pawan ne bataaya ki ve ab fasebuk par khulkar likhane lage hai
 a press conference was also held in Delhi in which Kanhaiya Kumar also attended
 pawan je en you se padhe hue hai
 His words reflect the idealism which our politics defeats in the end
 tarah tarah ke aarope lagaakar bharamaane kaa khel shuru hota he or aise adhikari ke manobal ko tod diya jaataa he
 Pawan's story is not just about an officer
 ek tantra kii he jo companiyon se milakar mazaduron ko lut rahaa he
 This story tells that the labor movement has also rotted from within
 wo baahar se mazaduron ke hit kii baat karata he, andar andar companiyon se haath mila letaa he
 i wrote this story after talking to Pawan
 or paksh ho sakate hai par aap jaanate hai ki sarkari paksh ke log itani aasaani se baat nahin karte
 Who can deny the cycle of exploitation and plunder from this story to a great extent
 tippaniyan Listening to Pawan Kumar, he felt how lonely one gets because of his honesty
 satta or samaaj donon use haashiye par dhakel dete hai
 Only the corrupt part of society claims morality and loots the debate
 jo eemaandaar hota he wo akelaa rah jaataa he
 Photocopies of documents begin to be collected, kept in the bag in the hope that some change will happen if a journalist exposes these things
 main apni ashankaon ke giraft main baitha rahaa, pawan yah kah kar jane lage ki ek din duniya badalegi
 Pawan started drawing my picture for his mother and i started thinking about you readers, really, after reading this story it seems that the world will change! i recognize you readers well
 pawan kumaar shaayad aapako nahin jaanate isiilie ek patrkaar ke paas ummiido kaa bag kandhe par lad kar chale aae the
 Do not send me the files of your agony by reading this story
 pawan kumaar kii tarah apni ladaai akele laden
 i can't fight pawan kumaar ne apana kaam karnaa shuru kiya or har din fil par companiyon or contract par lebar rakhane vaale sanghathanon ke kilaaf likhane lage
 Started raising objections unki aapattiyon kii nyaayik jaanch kii ja sakati he
 The result was that all became against them because by doing this the workers started getting their rights
 rote rote pawan ne kaha ki main tabadalaa yaa nilamban se nahin darataa
 i have worked honestly for the good of the workers
 mujhe koi barkhaast karke nahin jhukaa saktaa
 i can easily ignore those allegations and go to the place where i have been transferred
 pawan kii baton se laga ki unke daftar ke chaparasi se lekar sahakarmi or varisht tak companiyon se mili hue hai
 They go out to raid, the peon and the clerk inform
 unki anupasthiti main lok adaalat lagaakar shikayaton kaa companiyon ke paksh main nipataara kar dete hai jabaki shram pravartan adhikari ke bagair lok adaalat lag hi nahin sakati
 On May 3, he was attacked by the employees of the Regional Labor Commissioner office
 iske saboot main ve medical report se lekar tamaam report dikhaate rahe
 What a terrible thing that employees wring the neck of their senior officer
 pawan kii shikaayat par inkaa tabadalaa hua tha
 They were frozen at this place for many years
 ab tabadalaa phir se ruk gaya he
 When Pawan filed an FIR with the police against the incident of assault, the local BJP leader in return filed a case against him for assaulting the employees
 bhaajapa netaa kyon maamla darj karaayenge? marpet kii ghatana hui he to karmchaaree kara sakate the
 The Bihar Minerals Workers Organization (lohardaga), associated with the Indian Workers Union, has also complained against Pawan that Pawan Kumar was roaming with Hindalco mine outsiders and trying to form a union
 sahakarmiyon ne bhi es tii es si act ke tahat muqadame darj karaaye or companiyon se shikaayatein karain
 Pawan had reported more than two crore cases of gratuity payment violation against the company who complained
 pawan kaa paksh suna tak nahin gaya or wo puri fil nasht kar di gai
 Another company's theft case file was also disappeared
 ye sab pawan kumaar ke apane paksh hai lekin jis tarah se isamen raajnneetik dalon ke netaa shaamil he usase pataa chalata he ki is vibhaag ke tel se kitnon kii gaadi daud rahi he
 Talking to Pawan that companies are stealing minimum wages on a large scale
 rajya main kahin bhi nunatam mazaduri nahin di ja rahi he
 This will be happening in other states also
 shram pravartan adhikari maamle kii jaanch kar shunya se das guna tak jurmaana laga saktaa he
 If a company has not paid ten thousand rupees of minimum wages to a worker, then the labor enforcement officer can impose a fine up to ten times i
e
 up to one lakh but in most cases not more than five hundred rupees
 pradhanmantri tamaam jurmaanon kii suchi website par prakashit karne ke aadesh de sakate hai
 Similarly, hearing about the theft of gratuity of the workers, i was stunned
 agar ye sab sach he to sthiti kitni bhayaavah he
 Not only this, without training and safety, the workers are transported explosive material
 pawan ne apni shikaayat shram mantralay se lekar pradhanmantri karyaalay se bhi kii he
 The Prime Minister's Office sent him back to the Ministry of Labor and the matter reached there, against whom a complaint was made
 pawan ke anusaar shram mantralay ne jaanch kar maamle main lipapoti hi kii he
 Pawan told that he has now started writing freely on Facebook
 dilli main ek press conference bhi kiya tha jisamen kanhaiya kumaar bhi shaamil hue the
 Pawan is studying from JNU
 unki baton main wo adarshavaad jhalkata he jise hamaari raajnneeti ant main haraa hi detii he
 The game of misleading starts by making various allegations and the morale of such officer is broken
 pawan kii kahani sirf ek afasar kii nahin he
 There is a system which is robbing the workers by joining the companies
 yah kahani bataati he ki shram andolan bhi bheetar se sad gaya he
 He talks about the interest of the workers from outside, inside joins hands with companies
 maine yah kahani pawan se baat karke likhi he
 There may be more sides, but you know that people on the government side do not talk so easily
 is kahani se shoshan or lut kaa jo chakra saamne aata he usase bahut had tak koun inkaar kar sakegaa
 The comments pawan kumaar ko sunate hue yahi laga ki koi apni eemaandaaree ke kaaran kitna akelaa ho jaataa he
 Both power and society marginalize him
 samaaj kaa bhrasht hissaa hi naitikta kaa daawa kar letaa he or bahes lut le jaataa he
 One who is honest remains alone
 dastavezon kii photocopy jamaa karne lagata he, bag main sambhaal kar rakhane lagata he is ummid main ki koi patrkaar in baton ko saamne laaegaa to kuch badlaav hoga
 i sat under my apprehensions, Pawan started saying that one day the world will change
 pawan apni maa ke liye meri tasviir khinchne lage or main aap pathakon ke bare main sochane laga ki kya vaaqai is kahani ko padhakar lagata he ki duniya badalegi! main aap pathakon ko acchhee tarah se pahachaanata hum
 Pawan Kumar may not know you, that's why a journalist came with a bag of expectations on his shoulder
 is kahani ko padhakar mujhe apni vyathaa kii filein na bhejein
 Fight your battle alone like Pawan Kumar

 He talks about the interest of the workers from outside, inside joins hands with companies
 maine yah kahani pawan se baat karke likhi he
 There may be more sides, but you know that people on the government side do not talk so easily
 is kahani se shoshan or lut kaa jo chakra saamne aata he usase bahut had tak koun inkaar kar sakegaa
 The comments pawan kumaar ko sunate hue yahi laga ki koi apni eemaandaaree ke kaaran kitna akelaa ho jaataa he
 Both power and society marginalize him
 samaaj kaa bhrasht hissaa hi naitikta kaa daawa kar letaa he or bahes lut le jaataa he
 One who is honest remains alone
 dastavezon kii photocopy jamaa karne lagata he, bag main sambhaal kar rakhane lagata he is ummid main ki koi patrkaar in baton ko saamne laaegaa to kuch badlaav hoga
 i sat under my apprehensions, Pawan started saying that one day the world will change
 pawan apni maa ke liye meri tasviir khinchne lage or main aap pathakon ke bare main sochane laga ki kya vaaqai is kahani ko padhakar lagata he ki duniya badalegi! main aap pathakon ko acchhee tarah se pahachaanata hum
 Pawan Kumar may not know you, that's why a journalist came with a bag of expectations on his shoulder
 is kahani ko padhakar mujhe apni vyathaa kii filein na bhejein
 Fight your battle alone like Pawan Kumar
 main nahin lard saktaa
 Listening to Pawan Kumar, he felt how lonely one gets because of his honesty
 satta or samaaj donon use haashiye par dhakel dete hai
 Only the corrupt part of society claims morality and loots the debate
 jo eemaandaar hota he wo akelaa rah jaataa he
 Photocopies of documents begin to be collected, kept in the bag in the hope that some change will happen if a journalist exposes these things
 main apni ashankaon ke giraft main baitha rahaa, pawan yah kah kar jane lage ki ek din duniya badalegi
 Pawan started drawing my picture for his mother and i started thinking about you readers, really, after reading this story it seems that the world will change! i recognize you readers well
 pawan kumaar shaayad aapako nahin jaanate isiilie ek patrkaar ke paas ummiido kaa bag kandhe par lad kar chale aae the
 Do not send me the files of your agony by reading this story
 pawan kumaar kii tarah apni ladaai akele laden
 i can't fight pawan apni maa ke liye meri tasviir khinchne lage or main aap pathakon ke bare main sochane laga ki kya vaaqai is kahani ko padhakar lagata he ki duniya badalegi! main aap pathakon ko acchhee tarah se pahachaanata hum
 Pawan Kumar may not know you, that's why a journalist came with a bag of expectations on his shoulder
 is kahani ko padhakar mujhe apni vyathaa kii filein na bhejein
 Fight your battle alone like Pawan Kumar 
 main nahin lard saktaa

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley claimed that the change in financial transactions in the country from demonetisation and GST is the reason for improvement in Ease of Doing Business rating given by World Bank
 jetali ke mutabik in donon kadamon se ab bharat kii chhavi sudhari he or duniyabar ke kaarobaariyon ko desh main kaam karnaa aasaan lag rahaa he

 On the issue of Goods and Services Tax (GST), Arun Jaitley said that when the GST Council has worked to determine the tax in the country, assuming two standards
 pehla, council ne jiesti lagu hone se pehle alag-alag utpaadon par exise, waite, sas ityadi madon main liye jane vaale tex ke yoga ko aadhaar mana
 At the same time, the council considered the second base revenue revenue collected with the central government
 jiesti ke liye tex nirdhaarit karne main council kii koshish thi ki nai daron ko revenue neutral rakhane ke saath-saath kisi bhi utpaada athwa seva par jarurat se zyada tex na vasula jaae
 According to Jaitley, following these standards, the GST Council devised more than one tax structure
 isse aam aadmi kii jarurat ke utpaadon kii daron ko sasta kiya ja sakaa
 At the same time some things are still expensive and GST Council is constantly meeting people
 ummid he ki aane vaale dinon main council apanetax strecchar main or sudhaar kaa faislale jisase kaarobaari ko phayda milane ke saath-saath aam aadmi ke liye chijen sasti daron par uplabdh hoti rahen
 Can the relationship with the neighboring country be disturbed if information related to Afzal Guru, who is facing death sentence in the attack on Parliament, is revealed? This is what the officials of Tihar Jail believe
 lakhanu kii urvashi sharma kii ore se soochna kaa adhikaar (artiai) ke tahat daayar kii gai arji ke jawaab main tihaad jail ne apane jawaab main kaha he ki isse bharat kii samprabhutaa or ekta par vipareet prabhaav padegaa
 In addition, the security, strategic, scientific and economic interests of the country will be hurt or provocative
 jail mukhyalay (jail mahanideshak kaa karyaalay) ne afjal guru kii faansee kii karrwai se sambandhit 'blike warrant', dayaa yachika khaarij hone ke baad kendriya grih mantralay dwaara bheje gaye sandesh or afjal ko jail main rakhane ke dauraan us madhvaar kitna kharch aayaa jaise kaa byore ko ujagar karne par vibhinn upbandhon kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki isse bharat kii padosi mulkon ke saath rishte bighad sakate hai
 Sharma had also sought copies of documents or letters which were written, sent and acquired by the Jail Department in the process of fixing the place for burial
 sharma ne jallaadon ke naam, afjal ko dafan karne ke samay uske shav ke saath maujuud logon kii suchi or us vakt kii tasviir kii maang kii thi
 The jail department completely rejected his request
 jail adhikariyon ne jail main rahane ke dauraan afjal par kitna kharch aayaa aise sawaalon kaa bhi jawaab dena munasib nahin samajha he
 Sharma said that this is completely unfair
 aakhir ve dayaa yachika khaarij hone or uske baad faansee se sambandhit patrachaar saajha kyon nahin karnaa chaahate?artiai kaaryakarta ne kaha ki afjal guru ko jis tarah or jin paristhitiyon main faansee di gai or use dafna diya gaya, use lekar kai pradarshan ho chuke hai
 The jail department of Tihar Jail and the Central Government should show their gratitude on this issue
 unhone kaha ki ve is mudde par punarikshan yachika daayar karne ke vikalp talash rahi hai
 It may be noted that Afzal Guru, a resident of Sopore district of Jammu and Kashmir, was found guilty of involvement in the terrorist attack case on Parliament on 13 December 2001
 afjal ko nau farvari ko tihaad jail main faansee de di gai or uske shav ko vahiin dafna diya gaya tha

 apane mukhpatr saamana ke jariye shivasena jis tarah se rahul gandhi ke khilaaf aag ugal rahi thi, usase yah sochna bhi mumkin nahin tha ki rahul apane tayshuda kaarykram ke alaava bhi aam mumbaikaron se milane rasta nikaal sakate hai
 Despite this, according to his mood, Rahul changed the schedule and sat in the local train
 shivasena kii dhamkee ke bich yatraek taraf shivasena kii dhamkee, duusari taraf kade suraksha intjaam
 The challenge for the Congress Crown Prince Rahul Gandhi was how he would be able to fulfill his intention to communicate with the common people in Mumbai
 wo aam mumbaikaron se kaise mil paaenge, lekin rahul to rahul hai
 Separately from ordinary leaders, he also found a way out of it
 viley parley ke bhaaidas sabhaagaar main chaatro or ghatkoper ke ramabai ambedkar jhuggi basti main aam logon se tayshuda mulaakaat ke bich rahul ne nikaal liya aam mumbaikaron se milane kaa rasta
 Vile Parle to Ghatkopar via Localville Parle to Andheri - 1
 05 bajyandheri se dadar- 1
 29 pm Dadar to Ghatkopar-1
 44 bajeiske liye rahul ne jariya banaaya mumbai kii life line local train ko, jisase mumbai ke aam log safar karte hai
 After meeting the students at Vile Parle, Rahul reached Andheri directly at 1 in the afternoon
 baqayda line main lagakar tikat liya or vahaan se pakadi 1
 05:00 Fast Local
 western line kaa safar puraa kar rahul dopaher 1
 Arrived in Dadar at 29
 dadar main rahul ne atipi se kuch paise bhi nikaale or phir first class kaa tikat lekar wo central line kii vity-kalyaan fast local train main ghatkoper ke liye savaar ho gaye
 Rahul reached Ghatkopar at 1
44 pm
 stesan par maujuud log hue hairaanrahul ko apane bich paakar railway stesan par maujuud log bilkul hairaan rah gaye
 He did not even know that he would be able to meet Rahul in this way
 gauratlab he ki andheri, dadar or ghatkoper mumbai ke vyast railway steshnon main gine jate hai
 Common Mumbaikars also have to face trouble in catching or landing trains from these stations, but Rahul went through these stations without showing any problem on his face
 congress kaa haath, kiske saath?congress kaa naaraa he, congress kaa haath aam logon ke saath
 With these efforts of Rahul, it seems that he is turning this slogan into reality
 rahul ne apane chaar ghante ke mumbai daure main shivasena ko khub chamakaa diya
 Bal Thackeray appealed to the Shiv Sainiks to show the black flag to Rahul
 haalanki, mumbai police ne suraksha ke pukhta intjaam kiye the, lekin rahul bhi baar-baar tay kaarykram badal kar shivasainikon ko chakma dete rahe
 Rahul Gandhi had come to meet the youth and common people on a tour of Mumbai, but his visit turned into a game of hide and seek due to Shiv Sena's threat of protest
 shivasainikon ko chakaane ke liye rahul ne har jagah apane kaarykram main badlaav kiya
 He even reached Mumbai's lifeline local train among the common people, which Shiv Sena could not guess at all
 dhamkiyon se beparwaah the rahulaisase pehle rahul subah kareeb gyaarah baje dilli se mumbai pahunche or phir airport se viley parley jane ke liye sadak raste kii bajaae hawa kaa rasta chunaa
 Shiv Sainiks, who were planning to protest on the road, had no idea about it
 viley parvey helleyped se wo gaadi se tay kaarykram ke mutabik bhaaidas haul pahunch gaye
 Rahul was ready to fly from Vile Parle to the helipad by the Pawan Hans, but Rahul's convoy got out on the road
 shaayad rahul sandesh dena chaahate the ki wo kisi dhamkee se nahin darane vaale
 On the way, according to his habit, Rahul also interacted with people
 qatari main lagakar liya tiktabhi asli sarprise baaki tha
 Rahul reached Andheri railway station from Vile Parle and stood in the line of ticket counter there
 jaahir tha wo unka iraadaa aam logon ke saath local main safar karne kaa tha
 He did this as well
 bekhauf hokar rahul local main baithe or andheri se dadar or phir dadar se train badal kar shivasainikon ko chhakaate hue ghatkoper pahunch gaye
 It is clear that in this game of hide and seek, Rahul dodges Shiv Sainiks in his stronghold
 milane ko umad padaa hujummumbai main bhi rahul ke prati logon kii deewangi khub dekhi gai
 Wherever Rahul went, people gathered to see and meet him
 khaskar chaatro kii to maano barason puraani muraad puri ho gai
 As if Mumbai was waiting for Rahul Gandhi
 rahul ke saath saikadon kaa hujum
 Be it the roads of the country's financial capital, or Mumbai's lifeline local train
 congress ke yuvaraj ke samarthakon kaa kaaravaan rahul ke saath paane ke liye har jagah betaab dikhaa
 There was a lot of restlessness among the students to learn something from Lalkarahul
 din ke 11 baje udankhatole se mumbai pahunchane ke baad rahul pahunche viley parley ke bhaaidas haul jahaan unase mulaakaat ke liye management ke chaatro kaa bada samooh intazaar main tha
 Met the students for about an hour
 mulaakaat ke baad to jaise tamaam chaatro kii man maangi muraad puri ho gai
 Rahul's youthful glamor was speaking to everyone
 sabase pehle ham hai bhartiyarahul ne to inase mulaakaat main ye bhi kah diya ki aap bhale hi kisi bhi rajya se taalluk rakhte hon, lekin sabase pehle ham bhartiya hai
 Rahul Gandhi is definitely the General Secretary of the Congress, but these students are having big dreams about Rahul
 local train se rahul gandhi ke safar se congress main josh kaa maahaul he
 Congress leader Rajiv Shukla said that the Shiv Sena has been isolated after Rahul's visit
 chhitput virodh kii bhi ghatnaayenrahul gandhi ke bhaaidas haul se baahar nikalne ke baad shivasainikon ne rahul gandhi kaa putala foonka or rahul gandhi ke khilaaf narebaaji kii
 On the other hand, Shiv Sena raised slogans and demonstrated against Rahul Gandhi at Ghatkopar
 shivasainik haathon main kaala jhanda liye hue the
 Many Shiv Sainiks were also arrested during this period
 is bich congress ke varisht netaa kripashankar singh ne kaha he ki agar shivasena hangaamaa karti he, to ham chup nahin baithenge or iskaa jabaav denge
 Senior Congress leader Rajeev Shukla, on Rahul Gandhi's travel by local train and stopping at Dadar and withdrawing money from atms, said that Rahul Gandhi has broken the illusion of Shiv Sainiks by traveling to Mumbai
 thakare kaa farmaan hua bemanigauratlab he ki bal thakare ne farmaan jari kar diya he ki mumbai main congress ke yuvaraj kaa swaagat kaale jhande dikhaa kar kiya jayega, or shivasainik vahi karte hai, jo bal thakare kehete hai
 a statement from Mumbai everybody's was enough for Shiv Sena to target Rahul Gandhi
 party ne vaisaa kiya bhi
 Father Bal Thackeray fires in the face, son Uddhav fights the war of tongues and Shivsanis create chaos in the streets
 haalanki sarkaar kaa daawa he ki saare intjaam pukhta hai
 But the question is how successful the government will be in its claims
 pehle bhi maharashtra sarkaar sirf daawey karti rahi he or shivasena kii dadaageeri jari rahi he
 Rahul Gandhi's visit to Mumbai has been full of tension for the administration along with the state government
 rahul ke kaaryakramon main kisi bhi sthiti main shivasena or emenes ke kaaryakarta na aa paaen, iske liye vishesh satarkta barti gai
 In order to avoid any disturbances in the program, the arrangement of media persons was also done far away from Rahul

 Whether or not to go to school on Friday is not known
 abhi tak shiksha vibhaag ne is sambandh main koi vibhageeya aadhikarik aadesh jari nahi kiya he
 The situation of guest teachers which was 6 months ago in the month of March, the same situation seems to be happening again
 dilli sarkaar guest teachers kii andekhi kar rahi he or guest teachers ko lekar bilkul bhi gambhir nazar nahi aa rahi he
 Association President Pravin Tobadia said that the Delhi government had come to power with a promise to ensure guest teachers, it does not seem far away
 dilli sarkaar ko bas dilli kii janata ko free main sab baantne se fursat nahi he
 The government does not see the stoves of 22000 families
 22000 guest teachers berojgaar ho gaye to wo phir se apane haq ke liye sadakon par aa jaaenge
 The association has demanded that if the tenure of guest teachers is not extended in two days, then the Delhi government guest teachers will come on the road
 sarkaar ke ravaiye se lagata he ki guest teachers ko ab tak sirf isliye rakhaa gaya kyonki sarkari skulon main shikshak nahi the

 ab inhone guest teachers ko baahar kar diya he
 Now the guest teachers have no option but to get on the streets

 dhundh or kohre ne isaki haalat or bigaad di he
 However, there was a slight improvement in the Air Quality Index (AQI) due to the increase in wind speed on Friday and it was recorded from alarming level to very poor level
 air quality kii nigaraanee karne vaale system safar ke mutabik, dilli main agar acchhee barish ho to hawa main teji se sudhaar hoga
 The scope for improving wind conditions has increased in Delhi as western disturbances are expected to bring rain in northern and western parts of India

 In the first six months of this year, many big films like 'kites', 'raavan' and 'veer' in Hindi cinema could not achieve the expected success and even after much publicity, the audience was disappointed with the films
 pichley chah maah main 125 filmein pradarshit hui hai, jinamein se keval prakaash jha kii ‘raajnneeti’ hi 77 karod rupee se adhik kii kamai ke saath blocbster ban paayi
 Films business analyst Amod Mehra believes that 'politics' took place because it featured Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif in a political panchayat
 unhone kaha, ‘‘box offis par darshak ke taur par yuva bhi mahatv rakhte hai
 If these two actors were not in the film, then such a young audience would not go to see this political film
 iske alaava film main bade kalakaaron ne bhi logon ko lubhaaya
 Mehra said that the makers of 'kites' and 'ravana' had suffered losses of over a hundred crores and proved to be a big failure for them
 yahaan tak ki ‘housephul’ or ‘lav sex and dhokhaa’ to bhi thodaa bahut chal sakin
 He said, "all the remaining films were unsuccessful
 industry ko pehle chah maah main saadhe chaar sau se paanch sau karod rupee kaa nuksaan hua
 "mehra said that people liked 'my Name is Khan', 'ishqiya' and 'atithi Tum Kab Jaoge', but overall they could not collect much money at the box office
" janemaane vishleshak taran adarsh kehete hai ki ‘maai nem ij khan’, ‘ishkia’ or ‘atithi tum kab jaaoge’ kii asafalataa se vitarakon ko do sau karod rupee se adhik kaa nuksaan hua
 The first film screened this year was Salman Khan starrer 'veer', which came after the success of Aamir Khan's '3 Idiots'
 haalanki ek sainik ke taur par salmaan ke kirdaar vaali yah film darshakon ko raas nahin aayi
 The film was heavily promoted
 isaki patakatha khud salmaan kii likhi hui thi or unhone film ke liye mahalakshmi res course main yojit daud main bhi bhaag liya
 However, such propaganda definitely benefited from Shahrukh Khan's 'my Name is Khan', which the Shiv Sena protested
 darasal ipel main kolkata niterides team ke maalik shahrukh videsh main filmon kaa pramotion kar rahe the or maichon main pakistani khilaadiyon ke nahin khilne par unhone khed jataayaa tha
 After this, the Shiv Sena announced a ban on the film's release
 baad main puraa police tantra cinemagharon kii hifaazat main lag gaya or film ko pradarshit kiya gaya

 Now the CBI will not only investigate this scam, but will also investigate 47 deaths related to this scam, which has made this scam the biggest bloody scam ever
 inamen se ek ajtak kepatrkaar akshay singhki maut he
 a big question is that the post mortem report which could not answer the questions related to Akshay's death, will the Visara report be able to answer those questions? The post mortem report is not telling anything and the Visra report is not coming before a month
 report aa bhi gai to bhi abhi yah kahana mushkil he ki visra report sachmuthakshay kii mautki paheli sulajhaa degi
 The cause of Sunanda Pushkar's death is stuck on the Visra report itself
 desh ke tamaam top forencinc exparts or ennesail lab pehle hi kah chuke hai ki unke paas vah suvidha yaa takanic nahin he jisase yah pataa lag saken ki sunanda kii maut agar jehar se hui to koun sa jehar or kitni maatra main diya gaya
 Only after raising his hands, Sunanda's viscera has been sent to FBI Lab America for investigation
 ab aise main sawaal ye uthta he ki akshay kii visra kii jaanch report kya sachmuch maut kii vajah par roshni daal sakegi? shaq isliye uth rahaa he, kyonki ames jaise institute ne suvidha naa hone kaa hawala dekar visra kii jaanch se haath khadey kar liye hai
 After this, Visara has now been sent to FSL in Rohini for investigation
 jhabua ke sarkari aspataal ke doctoron nepostmortem reportmen maut kii vajah to nahin bataai, par maut ke baad akshay ke dil ke aakaar ko saamaanya se bada jarur bataaya
 Why, what happened and under what circumstances, it is not disclosed in the report
 maut kii sahi vajah batane kii jagah doctoron ne visra ke do alag-alag jaanch karwaane or uski jaanch report aane ke baad hi final nattejey par pahunchane kii baat kahi he
 One of these investigations is related to the heart
 jabaki duusari jaanch yah pataa lagane ke liye he kahidakshay kii mautjahar kii vajah se to nahin hui? jehar se judi jaanch ko ames ne karne se manaa kar diya tha
 After which now this investigation is being done in Rohini Forensic Lab
 ab sawaal yah he ki jayeekshay kii mautki vajah hi puri tarahavisra reportpar tik gai he to kya sachmuch visra report maut kii sahi-sahi vajah bataa paaegi? yah jaananaa bhi behad jaruri he ki aise kai kism ke jehar hai, jinaki jaanch desh ke kisi bhi lab main mumkin nahin he
 In such a situation, if Akshay died from such poison, which is not possible in his country, then how will the truth come out? From the ongoing investigation in AIIMS, it can be found out whether Akshya died from heart attack
 And did Akshay already have any heart disease? For the exact cause of death, it is necessary to present both the investigation report
 medical science or khaas kar toxicology yani jehar vigyaan kii baat karen, to akshay kii maut jin halaat main hui use shaq ke daayre se baahar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 There are many plants and plants such as Aconite, Yellow Caner, White Caner, Digitalis Percura, which can be used as food poisoning
 aam taur par ise kisi cheez main milaane par use khaane pine vaale ko iskaa pataa bhi nahin chalata or aadhe ghante se lekar do ghante ke dauraan jaan chali jaati he
 These poisons usually cause heart failure, wake up from the mouth and swings hands and feet

 vishwa hindu parishad ne shanivaar ko valsad jile ke arnai gaanv main sanskaron kaa aayojan kar 200 se zyada isai adivaasiyon kaa 'punardharmantaran' kar unhen hindu banaae jane kaa daawa kiya
 This is claimed by a local leader of the organization
 dakshinpanthi sanghathan ne yah bhi kaha ki punardharmantaran 'aichhik' tha isamen bal prayog nahin kiya gaya tha
 Natu Patel, chief of vhp's Valsad district, said, "as part of the ongoing 'homecoming' campaign, the VHP brought back 225 people from the Christian community today to Hinduism
" ' unhone bataaya ki vihip ne adivaasiyon kii hindu dharm main vaapasi se pehle unke 'shuddhikaran' ke liye ek 'mahayajna' kaa aayojan kiya tha
 Ashok Sharma, another VHP worker, said that about 3,000 people participated in the 'ghar Wapsi' program

 Failure to do so may result in legal action
 lekin, is maamle main jila colector se koi anumati nahin lee gai thi
 It is clear that controversy will arise from this incident
 udhar, isai sanghathanon ne is kaarykram kii bhartsana kii he
 They allege that forcible conversion of tribals is being done
 idhar, gujarat sarkaar is maamle se apana pallaa jhaad rahi he
 Gujarat government spokesman Nitin Patel has said that he has not received any complaint so far
 or agar jabaran dharm parivartan kii shikaayat milegi tab is maamle main karrwai par vichaar karenge
 Since 1999, the conversion of the tribals associated with Christianity has caught fire since 1999
 isai sanghathanon kaa aarope he ki 1995 main rajya main bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke baad se aisi ghatnaon ne jor pakadaa he
 Congress politics is only for the love of the chair and we work on the contrary
 yah kahana he ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kaa
 Addressing a farmers 'rally at Limkheda in Dahod district, Modi said,' Congress started a politics in which they were interested in the chair and not the welfare of the farmers
 congress ne kursi bhakthi kii, jabaki ham krishi bhakthi main shaamil hai
 Targeting the functioning of Congress governments, Modi said that when the farmers were given chickens to raise them, their meat was eaten by the officials
 modi ne kaha, 'yahi he jo un logon ne kiya
 We bring change
 ham tractaron or mashiinon ke liye karj dena chaahate hai
 We want to give loan, so that the children of tribals can go abroad and study
 ' unhone gujarat main pani kii samasya ke liye purvavarti congress sarkaron ko doshi tehraaya
 He said, if the earlier governments had worked on the water situation then our farmers would have been happy, but they did not do so
 modi ke anusaar, unki sarkaar ne adivasee kshetron ke pani se jude muddon ke liye 3400 karod rupee die
 Modi also said that the central government failed to add even one kilogram to increase fertilizer production capacity in the last nine years
 gujarat ke chote or majhole kisaanon ko pichley ek dashak main krishi main kranti laane kaa shrey dete hue modi ne kaha, ‘95 fisadi hamaare kisaan chote yaa majhole kisaan hai
 We do not have big landlords here
 gujarat main yah krishi kranti hamaare chote kisaanon ke kaaran he
 He also mentioned that his government has increased the budget for Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana (welfare of tribals) from Rs 15 thousand crore to Rs 40 thousand crore
 dilli nagar nigam (municipal Corporation of Delhi) or dilli sarkaar main ek baar phir se takaraav bad gaya he
 The reason for this is an order of the Delhi government, which was issued in the past
 darasal, beete dinon dilli sarkaar ke transport vibhaag ne nai gaadi kharidne ke dauraan registration ke saath lagane vaala van time parking charge ko kai guna badha diya tha, lekin kuch din baad hi dilli sarkaar ne is aadesh ko radd kar diya tha
 Now Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) is looking very aggressive on this issue
 nagar nigam ne aarope lagaaya ki dilli sarkaar ne jaanboojhkar use vittiya taur par kamjor karne kii sajeesh rachi he
 Mayor of South Delhi Municipal Corporation, Narendra Chawla, says that the Delhi government wants the Municipal Corporation to become weaker, so that development work comes to a standstill
 kejariwal sarkaar ne prastaav lagu karke liya vaapasadilli nagar nigam (MCD) ne hi is prastaav ko dilli sarkaar ko bheja tha, jise kejariwal sarkaar ne pehle to hold par daal diya
 Then this proposal was approved at the last moment and the Delhi government has raised questions on this matter
 nagar nigam main netaa vipaksh sarkaar ke is faisle kaa bachaav karte hue nigam par hi hamalaa bol rahe hai
 On the other hand, Delhi people consider this decision correct in view of pollution and traffic
 haalanki pehali gaadi kharidne ke vakt chhot bhi milane kii baat kar rahe hai
 Conflict has increased once again between the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the Delhi government
 isaki vajah he dilli sarkaar kaa ek order, jise beete dinon jari kiya gaya tha
 In fact, the Transport Department of the Delhi government had increased the one-time parking charge for registration during the purchase of a new car several times, but the order was canceled by the Delhi government a few days later
 ab Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) is mudde par behad aakraamak najar aa rahi he
 The municipal corporation alleged that the Delhi government had deliberately conspired to weaken it financially
 dakshini dilli nagar nigam (south Delhi Municipal Corporation) ke meyar narendra chawla kaa kahana he ki ki dilli sarkaar chaahati he ki nagar nigam or bhi kamjor ho jaae, taaki vikaas kaary thap ho jaae
 The Kejriwal government implemented the proposal and withdrew the Delhi Municipal Corporation (MCD) who sent the proposal to the Delhi government, which was put on hold by the Kejriwal government first
 phir aakhri vakt par is prastaav ko manjuuri de di gai or isi baat par dilli sarkaar ne sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Leaders in the municipal corporation are attacking the corporation itself, defending the decision of the opposition government
 vahiin dilli vaale pradooshan or trephic ke maddenjar is faisle ko sahi maanate hai
 However, while buying the first car, they are also talking about getting a discount
 isse kitna phayda?beete dinon dilli sarkaar ke transport vibhaag ne nai gaadi kharidte samay lagane vaali van time parking shulk main 18 guna tak kii badhotaree kii thi
 In 2017-18, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation received a revenue of Rs 22 crore, North Delhi Municipal Corporation Rs 40 crore and South Delhi Municipal Corporation Rs 47 crore from the one-time parking fee last year
 isamen nigam badhottaree karke is rajasav ko do se teen guna karne kii ummid kar rahaa tha
 Recently, the Transport Department of Delhi Government had increased the one-time parking fee up to 18 times when purchasing a new car
 beete varsh van time parking shulk se 2017-18 main purvi dilli nagar nigam ko 22 karod, uttari dilli nagar nigam ko 40 karod or dakshindillinagar nigam ko 47 karod rupee kaa rajasav mila tha
 In this, the corporation was expecting to increase this revenue by two to three times

 parsekar ke naam kaa prastaav manohar parrikar ne rakhaa, jiskaa francis disuja ne anumodan kiya

 disuja parrikar sarkaar main sabase varisht mantri or bhaajapa ke catholic cheharaa hai
