 bhagwaan kii di deh to chhotni hi he lekin ek duusari deh ham swayan gadhate hai-akshar-deh! jo yah deh garh pate hai ve nahin hokar bhi yaheen hote hai-hamaare aas-paas
 The latest compilation of the articles of socialist politician, writer-thinker Surendra Mohan, reminded me of the way to alternative
 surendra mohan un ginati ke raajnneetigyon main the jo manch par kam lekin manch ke peeche kii apni sarthak bhoomikaaon ke liye hameshaa yaad kiye jaaenge
 Constant deliberation on all kinds of problems coming our way and his relentless efforts to put them in front of people from all possible platforms is the result that we have a rich stock of his writings today
 23 november 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india today16 november 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india toderajakmal prakaashan ne unheen main se chuninda lekhon kaa 400 pannon kaa yah sankalan nikaala he
 Its articles were compiled and edited by Surendra Mohan himself - possibly the last work of his lifetime
 bhoomika main unhone likhaa he ki 1991 se bhartiya arthvyavastha main parivartan kaa jo chakra shuru hua or jo aaj tak jari he, use centre main rakhkar unhone vibhinn patr-patrikaon main jo kuch likhaa-sochaa, un sabakaa pratinidhi sankalan he yah
 His writing was ostentatious and he used to put his point straight without any big role
 unka bhav aksar yahi hota tha ki dekhie shriman, is sawaal ko dekhne kii ek khidki yah bhi he
 This work of opening the window is the religion of the politician, such commitment was also in his life and the same came down in writing
 hairaani kii baat he ki dainandin daleey raajnneeti main duube rahakar bhi vichaar-lekhan main pravrutt rahane kii urja or patibaddhta unhone bachaa rakhi thi
 i do not remember any other name here - not even among socialists
 arth-vyavastha apane-aap main koi alag cheez nahin hoti
 It is a reflection of your thinking about society and country
 jaisaa samaaj aap bananaa chaahate hai, waisi arth-rachana banani hoti he
 When you take pleasure in imagining a society in which the power of capital will be paramount, then they make all the changes in the economy, and add all the elements that make capital and capitalists in the front row
 And the rest of the society and country is made to stand in their favor
 1991 se hamaare raajnneetik soch main se us desh kaa antim taur par garbhpaat ho gaya jise bhartiya swatantraaa andolan ne dhaaran kiya tha or jawaharlal nehru ne pratham pradhanmantri ke rup main jise apni tarah se aage badhaayaa tha
 When the dream of the politicians about the country changed, the economics of the country had to change
 surendra mohan is sankalan ke praayah har lekh main ghatnaon par sidhi chot karte hai
 Unemployment, multinational companies, violence, farmers, panchayats have their eyes on every side and they try to see the ruling officers see their mistakes - weaknesses
 vyaavhaarik raajnneeti kaa unka lanbaa anubhav, samaajawaadee soch kii unki prishthbhumi or desh ke tamaam tarah ke saamaajik andolanon se unka judaav unke lekhon ko vishisht banaata he
 But here, all these articles also stubbornly decide what is the path of alternative? What is going on, analysis of their shortcomings and weaknesses is fine, but if it is not right then what is right and what are its practical steps, it has to be explored
 ek hota he chauraahaa, jahaan tak pahunchane kaa safar bhi aasaan to nahin hota lekin chauraahaa rasta nahin hota
 Several paths break through the crossroads and the traveler has to decide which path he now leads from the crossroads, and hold the path
 surendra mohan hamen chauraahey tak to laate hai, rasta nahin bataate
 Politicians, they do not come out of the scope of the parties, so they work with easy conclusions
 haa, is sankalan se hamen us daur ke tamaam tarah ke aarthik-raajnneetik-saamaajik pravahon ko samajhne main madad milti he
 Not much time has passed when Shatrughan Sinha not only expressed his open displeasure against Narendra Modi's claim to the Prime Minister but he was in the forefront of the BJP in showing his loyalty to Advani

 sir par chunari haathon main nariyal or vidhivat puja kii
 Bihari Babu was completely dyed in the color of worship
 patna sahib se saansad bihari babu ne durgapuja main maa se aashirwad liya
 The atmosphere was venerable but was not left untouched by Narendra Modi's rally
 bihari babu ne elaan kar diya ki bhale hi adwani nahin aaen par wo raily main manch par date rahenge
 In fact, Shatrughan Sinha has already announced himself to be on Modi's stage and attended the rally even before the call
 bijepi main namo mantra kii lahar ko dekhte hue shatrughna sinha ne maukey ko bhampa or saaf kar diya ki party se wo kabhi alag nahin the, shatrughna sinha ke mutabik wo sirf pradhanmantri ke naam kaa elaan parliamentry board ke madhyam se chaahate the or yahi hua, aise main unki naaraazgi ab khatm ho chuki he

 Therefore, we have resolved to complete the work of Delhi and West Delhi bypass in 400 days
 meraa vishwaas he ki yah kaam puraa ho jayega
 i believe that when this work is completed, the traffic from Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Haryana from one state to another will not go inside Delhi but outside
 isse jam se mukti milegi
 The traffic will also be reduced by 50 percent due to no jam
 dilli main trephic jam accident kii saporter he
 We are also improving that support
 ham road ko chaudaa kar rahe hai, bada kar rahe hai
 Every morning, there is traffic on Dhaula Kuan to Manesar Road

 If there was already an under ground underpass to connect this road, then i think the traffic coming from here, the traffic stops, it would not happen

 If we had made a tunnel from there, this problem would not have happened

 In Panigram, which is very close to the Yamuna Expressway, a young man told that the Yamuna river flows so close that the village gets flooded quickly, hence the name Panigram

 And many of them say that the sudden demonetisation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi proved to be a complete curse
 
 
 dopaher main ikattha ho gaye logon main se ek ne sawaal kiya, "aap bataaie, bainkon ke baahar linon main kisne intazaar kiya
 
 
 Did that make a difference to the thick-stomached Seths (from demonetisation)

 How could we pay fees? 
 
 ?" Some Jats, even after removing something from this crowd, still believe that their choice is still BJP
 
 
 ek kishor, jise uske dost 'tufaan' kehete hai (kyonki vahi itnaa bahadur he ki man kii baat kah sake), ne bataaya, "agar aap us taraf jaaenge, aapako ve jat milenge, jo bijepi ke samarthak hai
 
 
 In the other lane are the Jats, who support the RLD

 It was said about Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, "his account is not open here
 
 
 " darasal, is ilaake main sattashin samaajawaadee party majboot nahin rahi he

 ek anya shaks kaa kahana he tha ki is baat se katai fark nahin padataa ki bijepi ne mukhyamantri pad ke liye kisi kaa naam ghoshit nahin kiya he
 
 
 The BJP was said to have repeated the same mistake by not announcing the name of the Chief Minister, which she has done in Bihar, and the party's reliance on the Prime Minister for votes shows that there is a lack of alternative leadership
 
 
 yah shaks kahata he, "ham katai chintit nahin hai, or mukhyamantri baad main bhi chun sakate hai

 ? vah kisi vishwasaneey vyakti ko chun lenge
 
 
 It is exactly the same as Virat Kohli - he is accompanied by 10 other players, but the captain is the same
 
 
 so, (narendra) modi captain hai
 
 
 They have to win the match
 
 
 " This comparison of the political battle with the game of cricket came from a middle-class BJP worker, a well-known figure in the area, and could easily assume the role of a spokesperson if crowds gather
 
 
 anya partiyon kaa kahana he ki jin ilaakon main bijepi ladaai main he hi nahin, vahaan bhi uske 'bolne vaale' kaaryakarta aisa impresssont banane main maahir hai, jaise vahi sabase pramukh party he
 
 
 It is also true that in some areas when Dalits are surrounded by others, their choice is 'phool' (bjp's election symbol Lotus), but when they are taken away and asked some more questions, some claim It is that they have not been far from 'hathi' (mayawati's party Bahujan Samaj Party's election symbol)
 
 
 unke liye yah tay karnaa mushkil he ki unase in donon main koun-se jawaab kii ummid kii ja rahi he
 
 
 There are no signs of development in Yakubganj village
 
 
 vahaan sirf ek dukaan dikhaai detii he, jo darasal, lakdi kaa ek counter he, or us par kuch toffiyon ke dibbe or gutke nazar aate hai
 
 
 The owner of this shop is a Rawat (non-jatav Scheduled Caste) couple, and says, “we are Harijans
 
 
 pichhali baar hamane hathi ko vot diya tha, lekin is baar hamaare liye zaruri he ki ham phool ko samarthan den
 
 
 "he also explains the reason," You look at the rest

 Who will think about us? 
 
 ? yah dharm kaa sawaal he
 
 
 Should Hindus not unite? 
 
 ? bilkul hona chahie
 
 
 " bas, yahi is chunaav kaa saar he
 
 
 Akhilesh Yadav and Congress are in alliance and all their attention is towards Muslims and Yadavs, in large numbers
 
 
 so, hinduon ko bhi lagata he ki unhen is baar jati ke aadhaar par nahin, dharm ke aadhaar par vot karnaa chahie
 
 
 Such belief is spread all around that Akhilesh Yadav used important policies to benefit the Muslims, and he did this at the cost of the Hindus
 
 
 iske alaava police thanon ko yadavon ke bhartee centre main tabdeel kar dene ko lekar bhi logon main asantosh he
 
 
 a woman, a member of one of the four Muslim families settled in the village, said, "I can only hear flowers, flowers
" 
 
 ve sab unheen ko vot dene vaale hai
 
 
 i cannot vote for them
 
 
 kya de sakati hum
 
 
 ? "this woman has voted for 'cycle' (akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party's election symbol)

 saath hi nijee brands ke rup main unki chhavi kaa sandesh yahi he - vahi, sirf vahi janata kaa bhala kar sakate hai
 
 
 That is the essence of this election
 
 
 akhilesh yadav or congress gathbandhan main hai or unka sara dhyaan muslimon or yadavon kii taraf he, badi sankhya main
 
 
 So, Hindus also feel that this time they should vote on the basis of religion and not on the basis of caste
 
 
 aisi manyata chaaron ore faili hui he ki akhilesh yadav ne muslimon ko phayda pahunchane mahatvapurn nitiyon ko istemaal kiya, or unhone aisa hinduon kii keemat par kiya
 
 
 Apart from this, there is dissatisfaction among the people about converting police stations into Yadav's recruitment center
 
 
 gaanv main based chaar muslim pariwaron main se ek kii sadsy ek mahila ne kaha, "mujhe sirf phool, phool sunai de rahaa he
 
 
 They are all going to vote for them
 
 
 main unhen vot nahin de sakati
 
 
 What can i give? 
 
 ?" is mahila ne 'cycle' (akhilesh yadav kii samaajawaadee party kaa chunaav chihn) ko vot diya he
 
 
 Not given to 'hath' (congress's election symbol), she asks, "what can the paw give us
 
 
 ? cycle hamaare (muslimon ke) liye he
 
 
 " pichley hafte fatehpur main piem modi kii raily main juty bheed The Congress is absent in most such discussions
 
 
 vah zedpur jaise gaanvon main muslimon kii pasand he, yaa raibareli ke kuch ilaakon main uskaa zikr hota he, lekin bas
 
 
 The youth often say, Akhilesh Yadav seems to be doing a good job, but when asked to whom his parents are supporting, a group of school girls say, "modi, Modi
 
 
 " lekin rahul gandhi kaa naam koi nahin le rahaa he
 
 
 Neither youth, nor women, nor old age
 
 
 fatehpur main piem narendra modi kii raily main ek varisht police adhikari ne kaha ki unki reliyon main baari bheed pahunch rahi he (aalochakon kaa kahana he ki bihar main bheed voton main tabdeel nahin hui thi)
 
 
 According to the police officer, Rahul Gandhi is unable to do anything
 
 
 unka kahana tha, "lagata he, unke paas koi yojana nahin he
 
 
 Has he presented any post-election plan to anyone
 
 
 ?" akhilesh or rahul ko sunne ke liye elahabaad main baari bheed juty, is par ek shaks ne kaha, "kya aapako aisi hi bheed dikhi thi, jab rahul gandhi kisaan yatra kar rahe the
 
 
 The If people are coming to see him now, it is because he is with Akhilesh Yadav
 
 
 " Akhilesh Yadav addressing an election rally akhilesh yadav or rahul gandhi ke saath aane kii vajah yah manyata rahi ki ek saath aa jane se muslim voton kaa bantwaaraa nahin hoga
 
 
 Proof of this idea is also easily found
 
 
 yakubganj main ek muslim ne kaha, "agar hamen lagata he ki modi acha kaam kar rahe hai or main unhen vot detaa bhi hum, to yahaan ke baaki log yakeen hi nahin karenge ki maine unhen vot diya
 
 
 So why should i vote for him? 
 
 ? mere vot ko katai nazarandaaz kar diya jayega
 
 
 "he told," i got 150 people from my family to vote for the bicycle
 
 
 " vaise is shaks ne apane vichaar ek hindu ke saath baithkar vyakt kiye, or kaha, "yahaan, ham sab miljulkar rahete hai
 
 
 You vote for him, whom you want, i will vote for him, to whom i want
 
 
 koi tension nahin
 
 
 " yahaan shanti bhi kshanbhangur he, jaisaa haal hi main mujaffarnagar main dekhne ko mila tha
 
 
 Due to the presence of many castes, there is danger
 
 
 lekin ar chunaav bhi hindu or muslim ke bich chunaav kii taraf badha, to suraksha kam lagane lagati he
 
 
 The wave flowing inside cannot be completely ignored
 
 
 maahaul is tarah kaa he ki sirf ek bhadakaau, uksaau bhaashan yaa video se hi ek ghadi main hi voton kaa puri tarah dhruvikaran ho saktaa he
 
 
 While the cameras were covering the conversation with the elders of the village, a girl with a bicycle was watching from across the stream
 
 
 usne bataaya ki cycle ke saath use college fees ke naam par 10,000 rupee bhi mili the, jo akhilesh yadav kii shiksha ko protsaahan dene kii yojana ke tahat die gaye the
 
 
 She can't vote right now, but when she can give, "he will be an elephant, just an elephant
" 
 
 unhone (akhilesh ne) bhale hi mujhe cycle di ho, lekin vah bahanji (mayawati) thim, jinhone hamen sammaan diya, jinhone sunishchit kiya ki hamen nazarandaaz nahin kiya jayega
 
 
 Otherwise, what does Dalit get? 
 
 ? kuch bhi nahin
 
 
 " is ladki kii maa bataati he ki gali main ek ghar aisa bhi he, jisamen alpiji kaa silendar he
 
 
 He said, "she (narendra) was sent by Modi
 
 
 hamen nahin mila
 
 
 Maybe, some more may be sent
 
 
 " baharhaal, mahilaon main nishchit rup se garibon ko muft gas silendar dene kii yojana sabase badhiya maani ja rahi he
 
 
 No one talked about Jan Dhan Yojana or zero-balance bank accounts
 
 
 lagbhag sabhi ne alpiji yaa khaanaa pakaane vaali gas ke bare main hi baat kii
 
 
 Those who do not currently have cylinders, they are sure that their turn will also come
 
 
 yah us vishwaas kaa ek or saboot he, jo logon ke man main piem ke prati maujuud he - unke faisle prabhavi hote hai, or unki nitiyaan hameshaa sahi iraadon se banaai jaati hai, bhale hi unke kriyanvayan main kuch gadabadiyaan ho jaaen, yaa nattejey kuch der se hasil hon
 
 
 Opponents also believe that at a time when most politicians are struggling with a 'credibility crisis', the Prime Minister, who has spent half his term, retains the credibility established in 2014 despite demonetisation
 
 
 yahaan tak ki jo unhen vot nahin dete, ve bhi virale hi unke netritv ke tareeke par anguli uthaate hai
 
 
 The comments yuva mukhyamantri ke sahyogi maanate hai ki unke prachaar kaa shuruaati hissaa vikaas ke mudde par aadhaarit tha, jati par nahin, jisase pradhanmantri ko phayda mila, kyonki aarthik uplabdhiyon ke bakhaan ke maamle main vah kahin aage hai

 We will forgive the debts of the farmers, if the BJP government is formed then this issue will be included in the agenda of the first meeting of the UP cabinet
 
 
 akhilesh yadav ne jawaab main kaha ki rajya main jeetna zaruri nahin he, kyonki centre sarkaar jab chaahe, karj maaf kar sakati he
 
 
 Regardless of whether the BJP wins in Uttar Pradesh or not, the report card of Prime Minister Narendra Modi can be clearly read
 
 
 yah sachai ki unhen party se upar, or alag karke dekha jaataa he, haarane kii surat main zimmedaari se unhen dur bhi rakhega
 
 
 Also, this is the message of his image as a private brand - only he can do good to the public
 
 
 gaanv main based chaar muslim pariwaron main se ek kii sadsy ek mahila ne kaha, "mujhe sirf phool, phool sunai de rahaa he
 
 
 They are all going to vote for them
 
 
 main unhen vot nahin de sakati
 
 
 What can i give? 
 
 ?" is mahila ne 'cycle' (akhilesh yadav kii samaajawaadee party kaa chunaav chihn) ko vot diya he
 
 
 Not given to 'hath' (congress's election symbol), she asks, "what can the paw give us
 
 
 ? cycle hamaare (muslimon ke) liye he
 
 
 " pichley hafte fatehpur main piem modi kii raily main juty bheed The Congress is absent in most such discussions
 
 
 vah zedpur jaise gaanvon main muslimon kii pasand he, yaa raibareli ke kuch ilaakon main uskaa zikr hota he, lekin bas
 
 
 The youth often say, Akhilesh Yadav seems to be doing a good job, but when asked to whom his parents are supporting, a group of school girls say, "modi, Modi
 
 
 " lekin rahul gandhi kaa naam koi nahin le rahaa he
 
 
 Neither youth, nor women, nor old age
 
 
 fatehpur main piem narendra modi kii raily main ek varisht police adhikari ne kaha ki unki reliyon main baari bheed pahunch rahi he (aalochakon kaa kahana he ki bihar main bheed voton main tabdeel nahin hui thi)
 
 
 According to the police officer, Rahul Gandhi is unable to do anything
 
 
 unka kahana tha, "lagata he, unke paas koi yojana nahin he
 
 
 Has he presented any post-election plan to anyone
 
 
 ?" akhilesh or rahul ko sunne ke liye elahabaad main baari bheed juty, is par ek shaks ne kaha, "kya aapako aisi hi bheed dikhi thi, jab rahul gandhi kisaan yatra kar rahe the
 
 
 The If people are coming to see him now, it is because he is with Akhilesh Yadav
 
 
 " Akhilesh Yadav addressing an election rally akhilesh yadav or rahul gandhi ke saath aane kii vajah yah manyata rahi ki ek saath aa jane se muslim voton kaa bantwaaraa nahin hoga
 
 
 Proof of this idea is also easily found
 
 
 yakubganj main ek muslim ne kaha, "agar hamen lagata he ki modi acha kaam kar rahe hai or main unhen vot detaa bhi hum, to yahaan ke baaki log yakeen hi nahin karenge ki maine unhen vot diya
 
 
 So why should i vote for him? 
 
 ? mere vot ko katai nazarandaaz kar diya jayega
 
 
 "he told," i got 150 people from my family to vote for the bicycle
 
 
 " vaise is shaks ne apane vichaar ek hindu ke saath baithkar vyakt kiye, or kaha, "yahaan, ham sab miljulkar rahete hai
 
 
 You vote for him, whom you want, i will vote for him, to whom i want
 
 
 koi tension nahin
 
 
 " yahaan shanti bhi kshanbhangur he, jaisaa haal hi main mujaffarnagar main dekhne ko mila tha
 
 
 Due to the presence of many castes, there is danger
 
 
 lekin ar chunaav bhi hindu or muslim ke bich chunaav kii taraf badha, to suraksha kam lagane lagati he
 
 
 The wave flowing inside cannot be completely ignored
 
 
 maahaul is tarah kaa he ki sirf ek bhadakaau, uksaau bhaashan yaa video se hi ek ghadi main hi voton kaa puri tarah dhruvikaran ho saktaa he
 
 
 While the cameras were covering the conversation with the elders of the village, a girl with a bicycle was watching from across the stream
 
 
 usne bataaya ki cycle ke saath use college fees ke naam par 10,000 rupee bhi mili the, jo akhilesh yadav kii shiksha ko protsaahan dene kii yojana ke tahat die gaye the
 
 
 She can't vote right now, but when she can give, "he will be an elephant, just an elephant
" 
 
 unhone (akhilesh ne) bhale hi mujhe cycle di ho, lekin vah bahanji (mayawati) thim, jinhone hamen sammaan diya, jinhone sunishchit kiya ki hamen nazarandaaz nahin kiya jayega
 
 
 Otherwise, what does Dalit get? 
 
 ? kuch bhi nahin
 
 
 " is ladki kii maa bataati he ki gali main ek ghar aisa bhi he, jisamen alpiji kaa silendar he
 
 
 He said, "she (narendra) was sent by Modi
 
 
 hamen nahin mila
 
 
 Maybe, some more may be sent
 
 
 " baharhaal, mahilaon main nishchit rup se garibon ko muft gas silendar dene kii yojana sabase badhiya maani ja rahi he
 
 
 No one talked about Jan Dhan Yojana or zero-balance bank accounts
 
 
 lagbhag sabhi ne alpiji yaa khaanaa pakaane vaali gas ke bare main hi baat kii
 
 
 Those who do not currently have cylinders, they are sure that their turn will also come
 
 
 yah us vishwaas kaa ek or saboot he, jo logon ke man main piem ke prati maujuud he - unke faisle prabhavi hote hai, or unki nitiyaan hameshaa sahi iraadon se banaai jaati hai, bhale hi unke kriyanvayan main kuch gadabadiyaan ho jaaen, yaa nattejey kuch der se hasil hon
 
 
 Opponents also believe that at a time when most politicians are struggling with a 'credibility crisis', the Prime Minister, who has spent half his term, retains the credibility established in 2014 despite demonetisation
 
 
 yahaan tak ki jo unhen vot nahin dete, ve bhi virale hi unke netritv ke tareeke par anguli uthaate hai
 
 
 The comments yuva mukhyamantri ke sahyogi maanate hai ki unke prachaar kaa shuruaati hissaa vikaas ke mudde par aadhaarit tha, jati par nahin, jisase pradhanmantri ko phayda mila, kyonki aarthik uplabdhiyon ke bakhaan ke maamle main vah kahin aage hai

 Also, this is the message of his image as a private brand - only he can do good to the public
 
 
 is tarah kii zyaadaatar charchaaon main congress nadaarad he
 
 
 He is the choice of Muslims in villages like Zaidpur, or in some areas of Rae Bareli, but only
 
 
 yuvavarg aksar kahata he, akhilesh yadav acha kaam karte dikhte hai, lekin yah puche jane par ki unke mata-pita kinhen samarthan de rahe hai, schuli ladakiyon kaa ek samooh kahata he, "modi, modi
 
 
 "but nobody is taking Rahul Gandhi's name
 
 
 na yuvak, na mahilaayein, na buzurg
 
 
 At PM Narendra Modi's rally in Fatehpur, a senior police officer said that his rallies were drawing huge crowds (critics say the crowd in Bihar did not turn into votes)
 
 
 police adhikari ke mutabik rahul gandhi kuch kar nahin paa rahe hai
 
 
 He says, "looks like they don't have a plan
" 
 
 kya unhone kisi ke liye bhi chunaav baad kii koi yojana pesh kii he
 
 
 ? "A huge crowd gathered in Allahabad to hear Akhilesh and Rahul, to which a person said," Did you see a similar crowd when Rahul Gandhi was visiting the farmer
 
 
 ? agar ab log unhen dekhne aa rahe hai, to uski vajah he ki vah akhilesh yadav ke saath hai
 
 
 " ek chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte akhilesh yadav The reason for coming together with Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi was the belief that coming together will not divide Muslim votes
 
 
 is vichaar kaa saboot bhi aasaani se mil jaataa he
 
 
 a Muslim in Yakubganj said, "if we feel that Modi is doing a good job and i vote for him, then the rest of the people here will not believe that i voted him
" 
 
 so, main kyon unhen vot duun
 
 
 The My vote will be ignored at all

 But if the election also moves towards the election between Hindu and Muslim, then security seems to be less

 The atmosphere is such that only a provocative, provocative speech or video can lead to complete polarization of votes in a single clock

 He said that along with the bicycle, he also got Rs 10,000 in the name of college fees, which were given as part of Akhilesh Yadav's scheme to encourage education

 PM Narendra Modi's speech at the rally held in Fatehpur further deepened this color

 com / i8x7lkznra a video of a failed motorbike theft has suddenly started trending on youtube, which is three years old, but has recently been posted
 
 
 yah video utyub ke top trending video main shaamil ho chukaa he, or ise kul chaar din main 52 lakh se zyaada baar dekha ja chukaa he
 
 
 This nearly three-minute video is actually CCTV footage, in which a thief is seen trying to enter a house in broad daylight and steal a motorcycle
 
 
 koshish isliye, kyonki vah 'darvaaze' main hi funskar rah gaya, or phir jab ghar ke bheetar se niklaa ek shaks uski ore dauda, to chor ko jaan bachaakar bhaagna padaa
 
 
 This video is three years old, it is also known due to the timestamp on this CCTV footage, but apart from this, where and when this incident happened, it is not known
 
 
 video main saaf dikhaai de rahaa he ki chor pehle ghar ke lohe ke darvaaze ke baahar dubkkar baithta he, or phir mauka paakar daravaaza sarkaakar bheetar ghus aata he, or puri kamyaabi se motorcycle ko ghasitkar darvaaze tak le bhi aata he
 
 
 Just by reaching here, luck leaves him, and something happens that he would not have even dreamed
 
 
 video ko dekhte-dekhte jahaan aapako lagane lagata he ki ab yah motorcycle chori ho hi jaaegi, tabhi motorcycle darvaaze main funs jaati he, or chor kii lakh koshishon ke baavjood nikal nahin paati
 
 
 Meanwhile, a man comes out from inside the house, and runs towards the thief with a shovel, after which the thief has no way but to escape from his life
 
 
 tippaniyan The video is interesting, no doubt, but it's hard to understand why this video was posted three years later, and why it's trending
 
 
 baharhaal, in sab sawaalon ke jawaab nahin mil paaen, to bhi iske mazedaar hone main koi kami nahin aati, so, aap log bhi dekhie, or coment likhakar hamen bataaie, yah naakaam chori aapako kisi lagi
