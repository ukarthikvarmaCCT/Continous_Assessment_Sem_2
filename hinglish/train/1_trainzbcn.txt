 The mob broke the structure in about 5 hours
 iske baad desh bhar main sampradayik dange hue or isamen kai begunaah maare gaye
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) later moved to demand the construction of the Ram temple, which has been going on till date
 is andolan ne kai netaaon kii raajnneeti chamakaayi
 The biggest benefit of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement was to the BJP, which was once a 2-seat political party, today it is running the government in the center and in most states of the country, but there were many faces in this movement who were lost in oblivion
 'ajtak' aapako batayega ek aise hi karsevakki kahani jo ayodhya gaya to apane donon pairon par tha lekin jab waapas aayaa to dusron ke sahare chalakar or ab jindagi bhar ke liye bistar pakad chukaa he or gumnaam jindagi bitaane ko majaboor he
 This is the story of the Karsevak who spent his whole life in Ayodhya wanting a Ram temple
 ye kahani he achal singh meena naam ke us karsevak kii jo 6 disambar 1992 ko ayodhya main vivaadit dhaanche ko giraate hue aisa jakhmi hua ki ab jindagi bhar ke liye dusron kii madad ke binabistar tak nahin chhod saktaa
 The Karsevak, who wants a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya, is forced to live in a small dark room of 10 by 10 in a village near Bhopal
 kahani shuru hoti he 3 disambar 1992 se
 Achal was then 30 years old and reached Lucknow from Pushpak Express and then Faizabad from there
 6 disambar ko babari vidhwans ke dauraan gumbad ke ek hisse kaa malba achal kii peeth par gira or qamar ke neeche kaa puraa hissaa kaam karanaband ho gaya
 Now Achal is 56 years old
 poochne par bataate hai ki '6 disambar ko ham log gumbad par chadhe or jab gumbad giri to main bhi uske saath gir gaya
 My head and arms and legs hurt and the waist went away
 mujhe pehle faijabad main bhartee karavaaya or uske baad gandhi medical college lakhanu le gaejahaan mujhe hosh aayaa
 Since then i can not walk, i stay at home like this'
 netaaon ne nahin lee khabanchal bataate hai ki 1992 ke baad se kai netaa bhopal aae lekin kisi ne bhi uski khayr khabar nahin lee
 Achal shows an injury to his head and remains on the ground like this every watch of the day
 achal ye bataate hue khud kii bhaawanaaon par kaabo nahin rakh paae or footfoot kar roe
 While crying, Achal said that 'god tells that God is supportive of anyone who is suffering, this is true
 koi netaa ye nahin bol saktaa ki ek gilaas pani bhi pilaayaa ho lekin main jis ram ke naam se gaya us par vishwaas he ki wo puraa karegaa'
 Ram temple asked for modi-yogi: Achal Singh lost the lower part of the waist for the Ram temple, but he is very hurt due to the delay in building the Ram temple and is asking the PM modi-cm Yogi to soon Ram temple Get it constructed
 'ajtak' se baat karte hue achal ne kaha ki 'main unase yahi kehnachahoonga ki apni kursi na dekh kar modi ji or yogi ji mandir banaaen
 Their life will be successful in that, otherwise if they are made for the throne, they will never get this chance in future '
 'kismat rahi to phir jaaoongaa ayodhya'achal singh ko ummid he ki ram mandir banegaa
 On asking, we can not walk ourselves, but if someone takes it, i will definitely go to the temple and see Ramlala
 achal ne kaha ki 'ab kamjor ho gaya hum, ilaaj chal rahaa he agar koi gaadi main baitha kar le jayega to darshan karne jaaoongaa

 After the reconsideration petitions have been dismissed, there is talk about what are the possibilities in this case now

 milegaa upachaar yachika kaa vikalpapako bataa den ki supreme court kii ore se punarvichaar yachika par faisla sunaae jane ke baad bhi pakshakaron ke paas ek or vikalp hoga
 This is the last option against the court's decision called the curative petition (treatment petition)
 thodaa alag he yah vikalpahaalanki curative pitishan punarvichaar yachika se thodaa alag he
 In this, instead of the decision, the matter has to be identified in the issues or topics in which they feel that these needs to be taken care of
 is curative pitishan par bhi bench sunwaayee kar saktaa he yaa phir use khaarij kar saktaa he
 After the decision is made at this stage, the case ends and whatever decision comes, it becomes acceptable

 input: bhashaa Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has suspended Jitendra Kumar, Principal Secretary Secondary Education
 unke nilamban kaa kaaran laptop vitaran sambandhi soochna sangrahan va baantne main deree tathaa shaskeey kaaryon main laaparvaahee bataaya gaya he
 But according to experts, the real reason is not the fact, but it is believed to be making unfavorable comments, not interested in extending the tenure of Director of Secondary and Basic Education, very close to the power, Basudev Yadav
 rajya sarkaar nideshak kaa kaarykaal teen maah ke liye badhanaa chaahati he, lekin vibhageeya str par kaarykaal badhaane ke sambandh main abhi tak koi bhi sarthak prayaas nahin kiye gaye
 Due to this, their service extension is still stuck and due to this action is being told
 jitendra kumaar ko rajasav parishad se sambhddha kiya gaya he
 Jitendra Kumar was posted for the second time in secondary education
 jaankaron kii maane to pramukh sachiv madhyamik shiksha hote hue bhi unki madhyamik shiksha nideshak se pat nahin rahi thi
 The reason behind this is being explained by Basudev's methodology
 bataaya jaataa he ki shiksha adhikariyon ke tabadale se lekar vibhageeya kaaryon main basudev kisi kii dakhal nahin chaahate hai
 He bypasses the Principal Secretary and directly manages his work from a higher level
 basudev yadav isi maah 31 march ko ritair ho rahe hai
 The state government wants to extend his tenure by three months
 basic shiksha mantri ram govind choudhary bhi seva vistaar dilaane ke liye mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko patr likh chuke hai
 Based on this, the file for extending the service also ran
 madhyamik shiksha vibhaag ne carmik, nyaay va vitt vibhaag se seva vistaar ke sambandh main raay maangi to in vibhaagon ne aisi tippanee likhi ki seva vistaar funs gaya
 This file went from the Chief Secretary to the higher level
 ucch str par yah mana ja rahaa he ki basudev ke seva vistaar main jitendra kumaar ne hi baadha daali
 Otherwise, his service would have expanded by now
 ab unke ritairement main chaar din bache hai, aise main chunaav ayog se anumati lene main bhi baadha aa sakati he shaayad iske chalate hi karrwai kii gai he

 unhone gujarat main jati or sampradaay aadhaarit dangon kaa zikr karte hue kaha, 'maine dekha he ki 1967 main kya hua tha
 Many of you must have seen what happened in 1985 and we have also seen what happened in 1987

 -input bhashaa se The war of words began between India and Australian cricketers ahead of the third important Test in which senior players from both teams took on each other and were started by Brad Haddin calling India a 'weak' team
 hadine ne bhartiya team ko maujuuda samay kii sabase kamjor team kaha tha
 Haddin told the media, 'we know that this team can be weak like any team in the world
 ’unhone kaha tha ki agar chijen bhartiya team ke paksh main nahin hoti to vah duniya kii kisi team se jaldi bikhar sakati he
 India's fast bowler Zaheer Khan lashed out at Haddin, saying the Australian wicketkeeper should focus on improving his own performance rather than trying to put psychological pressure on the visiting team
 jahir ne kaha, ‘hadine ko apni wicketcaping kii chintaa kerani chahie
 i really find it weak
 use move karnaa shuru kar dena chahie
 Australian fast bowler Peter Siddle also reacted strongly to this and said that Zaheer took Haddin's words wrong
 sidle ne kaha, ‘jahir kah rahaa he ki hadine ko apni keeping par dhyaan dena chahie, main dekhnaa chahta hum ki wicketcaping par jahir kitni achche gur siikhaa sakate hai

 However, both these teams have one thing in common and they are also a matter of concern
 donon tiimon kii ballebaaji kamjor he or isi kaaran team main santulan nahin ban paa rahaa he
 The bowlers have done much better than the batsmen, but on many occasions they have also gone disappointing
 dakshin africa ko dekhen, to uski ballebaaji ab tak quinton di cock or captain phalf du plasis ke ird-gird hi gumti rahi he
 Hashim Amla made a half-century in the last match played against New Zealand, but the question is whether Amla can continue his form or not
 gendbaaji main lungi nagidi kii vaapasi se dakshin africa ko majbootee mili he
 Nagidi brought the thrill of crucial wickets against New Zealand in the last over

 During these seven quarters, there were many reactions to the decision taken by the central government of Narendra Modi on 8 November 2016

 During these seven quarters, the actual data of demonetisation continued to be collected by the Central Bank and the Reserve Bank kept counting the demonetised currency
 ab rigerv bank ne notembdi se jude antim aankade jari karte hue bataaya he ki vimudrit mudra main se 10,700 karod rupee waapas banking pranali main nahin laute hai
 Based on the annual report of the RBI, 15 of the demonetised notes in circulation before demonetisation announced on November 8, 2016
 42 lakh karod rupee kii raashi main se waapas banking pranali main lauti 15
 31 lakh crores has come out after deducting the amount of Rs
 notebandi se hona tha yah phayda1
 The banned currency of 500 and 1000 rupees in corruption was 85% of the total currency

 The use of this currency for corruption has stopped since the demonetization decision

 This will reduce the country's dependence on currency and the central government along with the Reserve Bank and other banks will have to spend less in currency operations
 cashles iconomi kaa phayda sarkaar ke revenue main ijaphe ke saath-saath aam aadmi ko bhi hoga kyonki uskaa paisa digital aadan-pradaan main zyada surakshit rahegaa

 The fake currency that reached his hands had to suffer immediate loss of such value
 vahiin sarkaar ko bhi iske rokthaam ke liye bade network kaa sahaara lenaa padataa tha
 The use of currency (digital payment) and large denominations has cleared the fake currency from the country in one stroke
 lihaaja ummid thi ki nai karency ke suraksha maanak zyada pukhta hone se agle kai varshon tak arthvyavastha nakli karency se surakshit rahegi

 iske chalate kaagajon par property kii kharid or vaastavik kharid main bada antar hona aam baat thi
 Due to this, the government had a big loss in stamp duty, while the common man had to face difficulties in buying houses due to not having black money

 The black money government will end that with the decision of demonetisation, the work of bringing social change against black money will be done easily
 yah hakeekat he ki kisi bhi arthvyavastha se kalaadhan tab tak nahin khatm kiya ja saktaa jab tak saamaajik str par iskaa bahishkaar na hone lage
 Until now, black money was invested in property and gold and silver, so that their value was always higher than the actual price
 lihaaja, notebandi ke baad in kshetron main kaledhan ke istemaal par roak lagane kii ummid thi

 band hogi samanaantar iconomicaledhan or bhrashtachar kaa sahaara lekar desh main hameshaa se ek samanaantar iconomi chalati thi
 In the country, from coal mining to roadside tea and vegetable vendors, they were involved in this parallel economy
 yahaan zyaadaatar log desh kii sakal gharelu aay ko nuksaan pahunchaate hue apni aarthik gatividhiyon ko chalaate the
 Therefore, the trend towards digital payments from demonetisation and the black money eradicated from demonetisation was expected to help in mainstreaming this parallel economy
 7
 The biggest advantage of promoting digital payments in the tax base will be that the transactions will be recorded with banks, big and small
 in tranjaction par inakam tex vibhaag kii bhi lagaataar najar rahegi
 When there is no basis for black economy in the country, then obviously more and more people will be able to complete their purchases only after paying taxes
 lihaaja, notebandi se ummid thi ki kendra or rajya sarkaron kaa revenue teji se badhegaa, uskaa vittiya ghaataa kam hoga or desh ke infrastracchar ko sudhaarney ke liye uske paas paryaapt sansaadhan rahenge

 financial seaving main hoga ijaphanotbandi ke pehle tak desh main log apni seaving ko property, sona or jewelery main nivesh karte the
 When needed, people sold it in the blackmarket and converted it into currency once again
 notebandi se pehle tak desh ke 50 fisadi se adhik parivaar apni sevings ko inhen tareekon se bachaakar rakhte the
 Most of the money invested here was also potential blackmoney
 lihaaja ummid thi ki notebandi ke baad real estate or sona apeksha ke mutabik ritern nahin den paaenge or aam aadmi in madhyamon main nivesh karne kii jagah apni sevings ko rakhane ke liye ek baar phir bainkon kaa rukh karenge
 It was expected that people would take more options such as savings bank, demand draft and mutual funds and also get the safest returns here
 9
 Increase in banks 'earnings The ban on black money, along with the fast-growing digital payments, were expected to see a big increase in banks' earnings after demonetisation
 mana ja rahaa tha ki is ijaphe ke sahare bank apana vistaar karenge or graahakon ko lubhaane ke liye aasaan or sasti banking kaa rasta saaf karenge
 Along with this, it was also hoped that the wealth collected by banks with demonetisation would help them to bridge their losses
 10 sasta hoga karjanotbandi ke baad se bainko ko rahe phaayde kaa sidhaa asar desh main byaaj daron par padana tay he
 It was expected that with transparency in the financial world, banks would try to give more and more loans to spread their business
 vahiin graahakon ko lubhaane ke liye vah karj par lagane vaale byaaj daron main badi katautee kaa elaan kar sakate hai
 With this, loans for business, buying cars or scooters or business in the country will start getting cheaper rates

 Chaturvedi said, "my mistake was that during the war against corruption, i took Prime Minister Narendra Modi's slogan of 'na khoona, nor khoonega gaya' as it resonates
 'magsese foundation ne buudhvaar ko chaturvedi or saamaajik kaaryakarta anshu gupta ko saal2015 kaa magsese awordadiye jane kii ghoshnaa kii
 After this, Chaturvedi told a TV channel, 'PMO did not support in the war against corruption

 Significantly, compared to other states, the number of seats in Jharkhand is still less in proportion to the population and this is one of the main reasons for the political instability here

 The AAP leader said, 'did Barack Obama get a call? Is Pakistan politics under pressure from America? ”keeping an eye on assembly elections in Punjab, Aam Aadmi Party said that the government should tell if there was any agreement between the terrorists?

 In fact, such a video is going viral on social media, in which two ministers of the state are seen laughing at the time when the visit of former Prime Minister Vajpayee's ashes was taking place
 asthi visarjankaryakram ke samaapan ke baad party ne mana kii yah ek maanviya truti thi or iske liye pradesh party adhyaksh ne donon mantriyon ko samajhaayaa he
 BJP spokesperson Sanjay Srivastava on Thursday evening spoke about the party's side in this regard
 unhone kaha ki kabhi-kabhaar aisi maanviya truti ho jaati he
 However, at the party level, both ministers have also been explained for this
 sanjay shrivastav ne yah bhi kaha ki congress is maanviya truti ko lekar bakheda kar rahi he
 It is clear that she is also engaged in giving political form to the death of PM Vajpayee
 bataa den ki guuruuvaar ko raipur main jagah-jagah pandalon main sabha yojit kar vaajapeyi ke asthi kalash ko shradhanjali di ja rahi thi
 At the same time, in a program, two ministers present on stage, Panchayat and Rural Development Minister Ajay Chandrakar and Agriculture Minister Brijmohan Agrawal were laughed
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ye donon mantri mobile par kisi clip ko dekh tahaakaa laga rahe the
 When the matter was tried to get a response from both the ministers, they kept silence
 vahiin, in mantriyon ke thahaake ko lekar congress ne bijepi par hamalaa bolaa he
 The Congress said that it respects former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, but the people of BJP themselves have nothing to do with his death
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ke mantri unke nidhan par dukh vyakt karne kii bajaay khushi manaa rahe he
 Congress spokesperson Shailesh Nitin Trivedi has termed this feat of BJP leaders shameful
 unhone kaha ki vaajapeyi kii kalash yatra ko bijepi ne majaak kaa vishay bana liya he
 On the other hand, Atal Bihari Vajpayee's niece Karuna Shukla has also jumped into the fray after the viral video caught on
 unhone donon mantriyon ko mantri mandal se baahar kaa rasta dikhaane kii maang kii he
 He also alleged that BJP is busy taking electoral advantage by taking out the Kalash Yatra of former Prime Minister
 iske jariye bijepi apni sarkaron kii naakaami chhipaana chaahati he or vaajapeyi kii sahanbhuti lahar paidaa karke phir se chhattisgarh, rajasthan or madhya pradesh main apni sarkaar bananaa chaahati he

 After Mahabharata and Ramayana, Tipu Sultan's serial gained tremendous popularity in the 90s
 20 november ko janme tipu sultan ko actor sanjay khan ne jeevant kiya tha
 The serial was titled 'the Sword of Tipu Sultan'
 ye sho didi neshnal par 1990 main oner hua tha
 This author was based on the novel by Lord Gidwani
 is sho ko dekhne ke baad hi logon ne tipu sultan ke bare main gaharaai se janaa
 Later this serial was also dubbed in Bengali and Tamil
 is serial kii shooting mysore main hui thi
 a total of 60 episodes were aired
 tipu sultan ne 18veen sadi main mysore par raaj kiya tha
 However, many people have different opinions about the show
 kai logon kii raay he ki tipu sultan ne jahaan 18veen shatabdi main arthvyavastha ko behatar karne kaa kaam kiya jiske chalate mysore us daur main iconomicli kaaphi shaktishaalee tha
 Apart from this, he also did a lot of work for his empire
 doosraa paksh ye bhi he kitipusultan ne kai logon ke jabardastee dharmantaran kiye
 He killed people of other religions
 charchon or mandiron par bhi unhone hamale karaae
 In such a situation Tipu Sultan has been a very controversial figure
 netflix or amejon prime ke content ko sensor karne kii uthati rahi he maangsoshal mediake daur main jahaan har mudde par bad-chadhakar log raay de rahe hai or ek aise daur main jab chhadam rashtrawaad se judi filmon kaa industry main bolbalaa he, jahaan film ke thode se bhi vivaadit political yaa period drama tone hone ke chalate in filmon or naatakon ke bain karne kii maang tej hone lagati he
 The demand for censoring the content of platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime has been continuously increasing
 haal hi main amejon prime par ek american sho ke ek episod ko bhi hataa liya gaya tha kyonki is episod main maujuuda sarkaar se judi kai kadavi baton kaa zikr kiya gaya
 In such times, making a film or serial on a controversial figure like Tipu Sultan can prove very challenging for any filmmaker
 tamaam tarah kii naagarik aazaadee bharat main samvidhan se hi nikali hai
 In particular, Articles 14, 19, 21 and 25 of the Constitution establish the fundamental rights of the citizens and the courts take care of them with utmost seriousness
 jab hindustan ne bantwaare, riyasaton ke vilay, kashmir ko lekar takaraav or nagaland main algaavvaadi andolan kii prishthbhumi main apni aazaadee hasil kii thi, tab sarkaar in sabake liye katai taiyaar nahin thi
 There were neither the necessary institutions nor the trained manpower to deal with such a situation
 prashasnic dhaancha lagaataar saamne aa rahi ghatnaon se nipatane main sust tha or kai maamalon main ghatnaon ke boj se dabakar rah gaya
 The primary task before the central government was to uphold the integrity of the Indian Union and everything else followed
 yahi vah praathmik vajah thi ki 1950 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main nagaland main aanan-fanan bhartiya sena ko tainaat kar diya gaya
 The army was deployed in a territory that was unknown and in many cases involved in further handing over of resistant villages and atrocities against the civilian population
 jangalon se bharaa vah bhugolic kshetra vishaal tha or us vakt sena is tarah ladi maano dushman se lard rahi ho
 He did not realize that they were his own people
 un shuruaati varshon main siyaasi netritv mudde kaa samaadhaan sena par chhodkar mutmain tha
 He failed because he considered the issue a matter of law and order due to ignorance or intentionality, not an issue that needed a political solution and to take steps after deep political thought to control the situation
 Wanted yah doordaraj kaa ilaaka bhi tha or us vakt sanchaar ke sadhano kii aisi haalat thi ki baaki hindustan or duniya ko sidhe pataa hi nahin chalaa ki nagaland main kya ho rahaa tha
 a similar situation arose in the 1960s and 1970s when rebellions broke out in Mizoram, Manipur, Tripura and Assam
 nae sire se gaanvon ke samooh bananaa or assam rifles ke balon se dabaav hataane ke liye izol par bambaari ke liye bhartiya vaayu sena kaa istemaal karnaa aise nitigat vikalp the jo beete do yaa teen dashakon ke dauraan itane berokatoke tareeke se sarkaar ke paas uplabdh nahin rahe
 We now have a situation in which the Supreme Court in 2017-18 has decided to investigate 1,528 cases of alleged non-judicial killings or encounters between 1979 and May 2012 in Manipur
 supreme court ne saaf taur par kaha he ki yahaan tak ki "dushman'' ke saath nipatate vakt bhi kanoon kaa shashan lagu hoga
 All this did not happen suddenly, but it has come as a result of several decisions of the top court

 basu faisla or sashastr bal vishesh adhikaar kanoon (eexspie) ko sahi tehraate hue kya karen or kya nahin ke paalan ke bare main adaalat kii tippaniyon main kaha gaya he ki jivan ke buniyadi adhikaar or kanoon ke aage barabari, sarkaar kii aisi kinhin bhi baadhyataaon se zyada ahm hai
 It has been firmly stated and reiterated that the rule of law is at the core of the government's legitimacy and a precondition of human security
 suraksha balon or suraksha pratishthan ke najariye se ise ek or aadchan yaa baadha ke taur par dekha gaya tha, jiskaa saamana suraksha balon ko baghawat se nipatate hue karnaa padataa tha
 It was also felt that the courts and civil society have no true understanding of the ground reality and situations in which the security forces have to work in the face of hostility in hostile terrain
 vidrohiyon ke atyaacharon or naagarik aazaadee ke ulalanghanon ko unhen nazarandaaj kar diya jaataa tha
 The security forces were fighting these rebellions with limited resources and they had one hand tied
 punjab anoothaa udhaaharan he jahaan ek vakt puri nichali nyaaypalika ugravadiyon se mili najar aa rahi thi
 There were repeated incidents in which terrorists were arrested, brought to courts for remand and released on bail immediately
 kai maamalon main to jab giraftaar ugravadiyon ko adaalat main laayaa jaataa to unke jamaanat ke aadesh pehle se taiyaar rakhe jate the
 Consequently, encounters were unofficially cleared to avoid such a situation
 main yah nahin kah rahaa hum ki suraksha balon ke haathon jyadatiyaan hui hi nahin, par unki majaburiyaan civil sosayadi or nyaaypalika ne kabhi samajhi hi nahin
 When the insurgency was at its peak in Punjab, no judicial officer behaving like this was ever taken by the officials above him
 duusari ore, jab ugravad par kamyaabi se kaabo paa liya gaya, tab pulicekarmiyon ne aaropon kaa saamana kiya or unhen jail bhej diya gaya
 It was a massive failure of the government that it did not grant pardon to those who had sacrificed their lives to safeguard the integrity of the country
 vidroh kii jad main chhipi buniyadi vajahon kii baar-baar lautakar aane vaali ek ahm patakatha usamen nihit siyaasi muddon se mukhaatib hone kii sarkaar kii naakaami rahi he
 In some cases, the government itself failed, as a result of which many of these militant / rebel movements continued to drag for decades without a solution
 siyaasi tabake ne sashastr balon or rajya police balon ko aage kar diya or mudde kaa samaadhaan nikaalane kii naakaami ke liye unhen jimmedaar tehra diya
 Under pressure to deliver "results", security forces resorted to a number of measures to overcome the situation
 inamen baagi dhadon se nipatane ke liye samarpan karne vaale ugravadiyon kaa istemaal karnaa bhi shaamil tha
 The cases of surrendered Sulfa (SULFA) in Assam and Ikhwan in Kashmir are prominent examples
 salwa judum ek or udhaaharan ho saktaa he
 When the fourth generation war is spreading its foot in the 21st century, the challenges of the security forces have increased even more
 khaskar aise samay main jab chaukanni civil sosayadi or soshal media aisi sthiti main hai ki suraksha balon ke kisi bhi galat kadam ko dekhte hi dekhte viral kar sakate hai
 There are supporters of militant factions in civil society who propagate their views as well as their works and obstruct any action taken by the security forces against them
 aaj suraksha pratishthan or saath hi suraksha balon main yah ehsaas bad rahaa he ki maanavadhikaron or kanoon ke shashan kaa ulanghan lambey vakt main ulate nattejey de saktaa he
 These days a lot of emphasis is being laid on this aspect in the training academies
 itnaa hi kaaphi nahin he
 Our training facilities need to be upgraded and that the implementation of the law should be deeply embedded in the minds of every security personnel
 magar iske liye ek kahin zyada bade sudhaar kii jarurat he or vah he aapraadhik nyaayik pranali main sudhaar
 The judiciary has a far greater role in this
 yah ab bhi vyavastha kii ek badi kamajori he
 The political class will have to implement these reforms in a big way and ensure that the rule of law is at the center of every program of the government
 tab tak, chaukanni civil sosayadi or sakriy nyaaypalika ko yah pakkaa karnaa hoga ki desh main har tarah kii naagarik aazaadee mahfuj rahe

 Defending its move by the United Nations to repeatedly put jaish-e-mohammed chief Masood Azhar on its list of global terrorists, China on Friday dismissed the US accusation that its act was violent It is like saving the Islamic group from the ban

 Without direct reference to the US, Geng said, "if a country accuses China of harboring terrorists because of technical restrictions, does it mean that all such countries are giving sanctions to terrorists?" If it makes any sense, then should we say that the country with the maximum hurdle is the biggest promoter of terrorists? " Asked about Pakistan's refutation of the evidence given by India on the Pulwama terror attack, he said, "the 1267 committee has detailed and clear terms and criteria on the listed issue

 Shahrukh Khan has very beautiful excuses to be happy today
 aaj kii taarikh main jab bharat obama daure kii khumaari se ubar rahaa he,shahrukh sabase zyada khush bhartiya hai
 After all, how many times does this happen when the leaders of the two democratic superpowers of the world speak a dialogue of a Hindi film actor in a span of just one hour
 baaki baaten chhod bhi den to, ham duniya ko phir se bataa sakate hai – haa, hamaare paas badshaah he
 Not the crown, not the jute
 or aisi tamaam duusari chijen bhi nahin jo hamaare paas duniya ko dikhaane yaa dene ke liye hai
 All such things were left behind in that special moment of happiness, when Obama said in his broken Hindi, "senorita
 
 
 bade bade deshon main aisi choti choti baaten hoti rahati hai
 
 
 Within minutes, Shah Rukh's fans tweeted so much that 'SRK Pride of India' started trending
 soshal media par bahes chal padi ki jis shahrukh ke saath america airport adhikariyon ne badasluki kii, usee shaks kaa naam obama ne gandhi ke saath liya
 He ended his conversation with the Dialogue of the same person
 modi ne obama ko apane vidaai twit main ‘bade bade deshon main
 
 
 Shah Rukh expressed gratitude in the same way, 'I am proud to be part of Obama's speech
 sunakar udhaas hua ki vah bhangada nahin kar paae, lekin agali baar 'chainya-chainya par pakkaa hoga
 Senorita was not the last shot of Obama's Shahrukh love
 apane bhaashan main obama ne bharat main dharm or vividhta ke ullekh main bhi shahrukh kaa zikr kiya
 Obama said that India will be successful as long as it is not divided on religious grounds and people other than their faith will continue to watch films of actors like Shah Rukh and applause, just like they celebrate in the name of Milkha Singh or Mary Kom Let's celebrate

 An actor, a personality like this

 In 2012, as Shah Rukh himself points out, US authorities detained him at White Plains Airport when he was going to lecture at Yale University
 bharat sarkaar ke hastkshep karne par unhen poochtacha kaksh se baahar laayaa gaya
 Later, in his speech at Yale University, Shah Rukh made fun of the incident, saying, "whenever i find myself getting angry, i go to America
" imigrationavaalon ne to mere staradam kii hawa nikaal di
 They always ask me my length and every time i tell that i am 5 feet 10 inches
 agali baar, agar unhone meraa rang poocha to main boluungaa – safed
 Earlier in 2009, Shah Rukh was interrogated for several hours at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey
 shahrukh tab apni film ‘maay nem ij khan’ ke pramotion ke silsile main gaye the, jisamen dikhaaya gaya he ki kaise ek vyakti jiske naam main khan laga he vah 9 / 11 hamale ke baad ke halaat se jujhataa he
 It is possible that now the officers will not appear or be stopped in the name of questioning at the American airport
 aisi haalat main senorita kii ankhon main dekh kar shahrukh jo bolenge, hame bhi maaloom he, “bade bade deshon main aisi choti choti baaten hoti rahati hai

 Anant Narayan Mahadevan's film 'the Expose', released this week, is produced by Vipin Reshammiya
 film main mukhya bhoomikaayen nibhaai he, himesh reshmia, hani singh, joya afaroz, sonaali raut, jesi randhaava, nakul vaidya or mehmaan bhoomika main najar aa rahe hai irfan khan
 The story of the film is based on the film industry of the 60s, where superstar Ravi Kumar, ie Himesh Reshammiya moves from Hindi films to Hindi films, from director Subba Prasad, from Anant Narayan Mahadevan's Sheetal Nirmal Ujjwal
 duusari ore he nirdeshak chaddha kii film 'rina meraa naam'
 When the film is released, there is an accident on the party day, in which a heroine is killed
 koun he is maut kaa jimmedaar, kaise khulti he parat dar parat or kaise sulajhati he yah gutthi
 You have to watch the film to know this
 ab aapako bataanaa jaruri he ki film mujhe kisi lagi
 It is told at the beginning of the film that this film is based on true events, due to which the audience tries to find the characters of the film in the history of cinema and especially people like me, who are aware of a lot of stories in the film world
 , They will probably continue to grope history throughout the film
 duusari baat yah ki film ke dialog aapkaa manoranjan karenge
 The music of the film has a spice of the 60s and 70s, be it songs or background scores, which i liked very much
 aajkal filmon main bahut kam aise becoground score hote hai, jo aapke jahan main bas jaaen or unhen gunagunaane par majaboor ho jaaen 'da expos' main aisa hi hua
 Himesh Reshammiya, who is seen in the lead role of the film, seems to be inspired by the popular actor Rajkumar and his character in the film has been well crafted
 saath hi mujhe yah kehane main koi hichkichaahat nahin ki himesh ne apane kirdaar ko achche se nibhaayaa he
 Himesh was seen as an actor
 haa, mujhe ection seens un par thik nahin lage
 Honey Singh leaves his impact in one or two scenes
 irfan khan kaa kaam jitna najar aayaa, vah acha laga
 The songs of the film sounded sweet to me, but even if the lyrics of some songs were like the 60s, it would have been better
 kahin-kahin costum or dance main nirdeshak ne us dashak kaa khyal nahin rakhaa, jis dashak kii yah kahani he
 The story of the film is very straightforward and small, so there is a slight obstruction in the first part
 haalanki film kaa edit screenple or kahani ko bayaan karne kaa andaaj aapako film se jode rakhega
 So overall 'the Expos' is an entertainment-packed film where you will find events and dialogues playing Larger Than Life, like the cinema of the 70s
 meri taraf se is film ko 3
 5 stars bainkon main avaidh note jamaa karne kii samay seemaa 30 disambar ko khatm ho chuki he
 Now only such notes can be deposited in Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
 dilli main bhi arabiai ke baahar puraane note jamaa karne waalon ko jute dekha ja saktaa he
 People are coming from other states for the same purpose
 lekin sabhi ko niraashaa hi haath lagi
 Those who are coming from Delhi or nearby states with the intention of depositing illegal notes with the RBI, when asked why they did not deposit them in banks till December 30, gave different reasons
 kuch vajahen to bahut vicitra hai
 1- Husband used to drink liquor
 a lady from Delhi came to get a change of money
 a woman from Delhi said- 'I was sick, i would have drunk liquor to get my husband to change, so she came herself
 ' mahila ke saath aae uske pati ne kaha- 'ab ek hajaar ke is note ko frem karake rakhenge or dekhenge ki vot kisko dena he
 '2- The note rat went to Kutra, Rahul of Noida said- Two new two-two thousand notes were offered to God, the rats took both the notes away
 kal mili hai to ab arabiai main ye kutre hue note nahin badale gaye
 3- Collection of notes with heavy number of 786, in the series of notes, finally a young man who was fond of collection of 786 notes also appeared upset
 bolaa- 'kai saal se 786 ke number vaale noton kaa collection kar rahaa tha, pehle to sochaa nahi badaloongaa
 When it came to know that the government can also take action on keeping old notes, then it came here
 '4- airport par hi kyon nahin badale notelkhanau ke rahane vaale kamran pichley ek saal se saudi arab main the
 Now when the RBI came to change the note, it was refused
 kamran ke mutabik unase kaha gaya ki airport par hi badal lene chahie the
 '5- The child's omen notes came from Gullak, a man from Fatehpur UP reached RBI with Rs 4000
 inke bachche ke janm par naanaa nani ne shagun ke taur par ye rupee die the, ab tak gullak main the
 Now, if they came out, they brought it here, but disappointment was at hand
 6- maa ke nidhan kii vajah se nahin jamaa ho sake noteek shaks aisa bhi tha jo maa kaa deth certificate lekar aayaa hua tha
 He said that due to the demise of his mother, he could not collect old notes
 7- fate note baad main badalane ke liye kaha thaek or shaks ne kaha ki use kaha gaya tha ki fate note baad main badale jaaenge, isliye ab unhen lekar aayaa
 8- The brain is not working, i have brought MRI
 Another person said- 'I have been ill for two and a half years, have also brought MRI
 dimag kaam nahin kar rahaa
 There are also x-rays
 abhi bhi tabiyat kharaab he
 '9- Wife was hiding in sweaters, now she is getting banged
 a man said-' Wife was hiding 12,000 rupees in sweaters
 ab dhakke kha rahe hai
 '10 - The mother had forgotten to keep it and said that the young man who came with the intention of submitting the note said -' Mommy had money, but she had forgotten them
 kal achaanak mili
 ' jahaan ek ore centre sarkaar or rajya sarkaron ne ganga, yumna jaisi jeevandaayaneey nadiyon par hajaaron karodon kharch karne ke baad bhi haalat bad se badtar hote ja rahe hai

 ' In sports such as shooting, the cry of lack of competition, prize money and lack of attention in the media has been going on for a long time
 aise main kuch olympic shooters ne ek anuthe toornament kaa aayojan kar yuva shooters ko nayaa manch diya
 Last week, a different kind of fair was held at Karni Singh Shooting Range in Delhi
 nishaanaa lagaate 300 shooters is range kii raunak badhaate rahe
 Former World Champion Manavjit Singh Sandhu, former World No
1 shooter Ronjan Sodhi, women shooter Olympian Shagun Chaudhary, shooting association president Rani Singh and the common Indian shooter continued to target it all on one platform
 inamen se koi ek−duusare ko maat dekar inaam jeet saktaa tha
 It was a unique tournament of its kind in India
 nishanebaaj 35 lakh kii prisemani vaale is toornament main ek−duusare ko takkar dekar inaam ke alaava apana hausala bhi badhaate rahe
 In the tournament, a young and common shooter could also win, so a handicap system was implemented like a golf
 darasal europe kii tarah hi bharat main ronjan sodhi or maanavjit sandhu jaise shooters ne is tarah kareeb 300 shooters ko indian shotgan open main ek fletform par nishaanaa lagane kaa mauka diya
 Ronjan Sodhi says that there is no prize money tournament in India, so we thought that if such a tournament is organized then people will be interested in shooting
 duusare hamane isamen hendicap system lagu kiya taaki yuva shooters ko jeet kaa mauka mili or antarrashtriya shooters par apane naam ke mutabik, shoot karne kaa dabaav bhi ho
 Manavjit Singh Sandhu says that IPL is such a good platform in cricket, it is very less in other sports, so we have brought a shooting tournament of 35 lakhs
 yahaan kareeb 100 shooters ko inaam milanaa tay he
 Current and former shooters at the Olympic level believe that this will not only increase the popularity of the sport among the youth but will also have many other benefits
 bharat kii pehali mahila olympian trep shooter shagun choudhary kahati hai isse shooting kaa rutaba jarur badhegaa
 This will create an atmosphere of shooting among the common people
 iske liye zyada log dilchaspee dikhaa sakate hai
 Four-time Olympian trap shooter Manasher Singh says that one of the advantages for shooters who are willing to do such shooting is that they can experiment during this time
 shooting ko lekar prisemani toornament kaa aayojan itnaa bhi aasaan nahin
 Ronjan and Manavjeet had to sell papad for the tournament with a prize money of 35 lakh
 aakhri din tej barish main mushkil to hui, lekin nishanebaajon kii gan aag ugalati rahi
 Many suitors also see its benefits
 neshnal champion shooter shreyasi singh kahati hai ki 2012 main landan olympic main ronjan sodhi kii shooting ke vakt darshakon ne shor machaa kar His attention was diverted and he had to bear the brunt of it
 is vakt yahaan mausam kharaab he or hooting bhi ho rahi he
 Here mushkil halaat main shooting kaa acha abhyaas ho saktaa he
 Amit Bhalla of Manav Rachna University, co-sponsor of the Indian Shotgun Open, says that the role of media is important in making any sport important
 media ko in khelon ko tavajjo deni chahie, kyonki ye khel aapako olympic main medal hasil karavaate hai, lekin vah yah maanate hai ki is tarah ke toornament kaa live telecast ho to in khelon ko vaaki bahut phayda hoga
 It happened so much that the shooters who took part praised this tournament very much, but the tournament was still marginalized for the television media
 ek alag or shandaar toornament ke aayojan ke baavjood aksar in khelon kii haalat jangal main mor nacha kisne dekha jaisi kahawat ban jaati he
 Officials and organizers need to understand that the issue of live telecast media and market is interlinked and not having one of them affects its popularity

 kul milakar arjuna rampaul ke kariyar kaa sach yahi he
 Everyone says when it comes to acting this handsome fellow
 in dinon bollywood main unke naam ke ek kisse kii charchaa bahut joro par he ki kaise ek diarector ne unhen ek aisa role sunaaya
 The director believed that Arjun's acting would be highly appreciated
 par arjuna ne apana role sunne ke baad diarector ko yah kahkar waapas lautaa diya ki is role ke liye irfan khan sabase achche hai, kyonki ve acting jaanate hai
 He himself admitted that he does not know acting
 namak main nakaaratmak urja or sookshm keetanuon ko khatm karne kii takat hoti he
 Therefore, use sea salt while mopping the house
 samudri namak na hone par aap saamaanya namak kaa bhi istemaal kar sakate hai
 Putting a little salt in the water while mopping will eliminate all germs on the floor
 isse ghar kii nakaaratmak urja nikal jaati he
 The special usefulness of salt mop is stated in Vastu
 ye bhi aajamaayen
 
 
 So that the decorations do not come into the house with negative energetic diseases, neem leaves also remove the negativity of the house
 agar aap neem ke patton ko nahin kha sakati to use jalaakar ghar main dhuna karen
 By doing this, the bacteria present in the house will be destroyed
 bataa den ki aisa karne se ghar kaa vaastudosh bhi dur hota he
 If children or elders are falling ill repeatedly in the camphor house or there is always a complaint of cough and cold, then keep camphor in one corner of the house
 aap puja ke samay aarti karte hue yaa karne ke baad kapur or laung jalaakar uskaa dhuna puure ghar main dikhaaen
 All the negativity in the home environment will go away

 Keep it in place gande bistar par na soye
 It is also said in Vastu that cleanliness of the house is necessary to bring positive energy in the house

 Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar on the decision to purchase 36 fighter aircraft from France has told the truth that it will provide oxygen to the Indian Air Force
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki pichley kai varshon se bhartiya vayusena kii maarak kshamta lagaataar ghat rahi he
 Especially given the challenges facing China and Pakistan
 haalanki vayusena kii jaruraton ko dekhte hue is oxigen se fori raahat to mil jaaegi, lekin aage ke liye koi thos intjaam karnaa hoga
 In place of the MMRCA ie Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft Deal, which has been running for decades, now the deal will be around $ 4 billion i
e
 about four thousand crore rupees directly from the slaves company of France
 sidhaa matlab he ek rafaal vimaan kii keemat 600 karod ke lagbhag aegi
 The great thing is that these aircraft will be supplied in two lots and within two years
 philhal naa to yah desh main banegaa or naa hi transfar of technology kii koi shart he
 If we look at it immediately, it will have two benefits, one is that the Air Force will get aircraft soon, the price will be lower and better
 vayusena ke purv pramukh airchif marshall espi tyaagi kehete he ki 2001 se aap ladaaku vimaan kharidne kaa soch rahe the, lekin faisla nahin le paa rahe the, maujuuda halaat main isse behatar koi or faisla nahi ho saktaa he
 Anyway, the strength of the Air Force was decreasing
 It has been 15 years when an aircraft was purchased
 mig puraane padate ja rahe he or kai scovdran to mahaj kaagajon par chal rahe hai
 By the year 2020, 12 Air Force squadrons are retiring, then where are the aircraft to replace them? Hindustan Aeronautics Limited ie HAL is making the speed Combat Aircraft at the speed, so do not know when it will become the true strength of the Indian Air Force
 Will get vayusena maujuuda elsies kii jagah mark-2 elsie chaah rahi he, lekin abhi tak uskaa koi ata pataa nahin he
 It is not even decided which engine will be put in it
 aise halaat main ginati ke hi vikalp bachate hai, masalan or sukhoi kharide jaaen
 But so far there is a problem in its engine and ejection, which will not work without removing it
 upar se yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he sukhoi he to sasta, lekin iskaa life saikil cost manhagaa padataa he
 The right cancer makes Russia's poor condition
 tabhi to vayusena ke hi ek anya purv pramukh air chif marshall pivi nayak kehete hai rafaal se behatar deal kuch or nahin ho sakati thi
 At present, these aircraft will come, after taking experience from it, later, if needed, more aircraft can also be purchased
 pradhanmantri narendra modi to fansi hui deal ko baahar nikaalkar vayusena kii jarurat ko samajha he
 It is true that the Air Force needs a fighter aircraft immediately, because it is an operational requirement
 sarkaar ke paas bahut zyada vikalp nahi the
 This is why the deal was done
 vaise bhi pakistan kii tulana main bhi bhartiya vayusena kii maarak kshamta kam hoti ja rahi thi
 The Air Force needs about 40 squadrons and currently around 28 squadrons remain
 inamen se 12 skadravan to puraane mig ke hai
 Although many can say that if one Sukhoi is equal to six Mig, then there will be no significant difference
 lekin ye kehane kii baaten he jab bhi jang hui he to hamaari behatar hathiyaar kii kamiyaan ujagar hui
 Whether it talks about 1962 or the 1999 Kargil war
 vayusena ke afasar to khulkar is saude ko lekar nahin bol rahe hai, lekin vah kah rahe hai ki hamanen to 126 ladaaku vimaan maange the or mil rahe hai mahaj 36, jabaki chunautiyaan ghatane ke bajaay bad hi rahi hai
 According to Force magazine editor Pravin Sahni, the first thing is that the government does not have enough money to buy 126 fighter aircraft by spending more than twenty billion dollars on the Air Force
 aaj haalat yah he ki vayusena ko jo vimaan milenge use unheen se kaam chalaanaa padegaa
 It is another matter that what can she do in addition to this? This aircraft will run for almost 40 years
 vayusena ne hi is vimaan ko kai dusron vimaanon ke baavjood oke kiya tha
 Yes, with the arrival of this aircraft, maintenance and other other arrangements will have to be made which will not be easy
 shaayad bahut se logon ko nahin pataa hoga ki vayusena ke paas ek nahin ab to chah tarah ke ladaaku vimaan hai or saatvaan aane vaala he
 If a fifth generation fighter aircraft is being formed in collaboration with Russia, then there will be an eighth type of aircraft
 duniya main aisa or desh nahin he, jiske paas itane tarah ke vimaan hai
 Every aircraft is maintained differently
 kal purja alag he
 It is understandable how much difficulty the Air Force will have in keeping these aircraft fit
 ek or bada sawaal piem ke mek in india kaa kya hoga? vimaan ke lene ke baad iskaa vikalp khulaa he
 If the matter is made, if Rafale buys the aircraft, then it can be made in India
 barshate echeel kii haalat main or sudhaar ho jisase vah vayusena or daason kaa vishwaas jeet paae or world class ladaaku vimaan banaae
 According to Mohan Guruswami 2019's Pew Research, two-thirds of Indians consider corruption as a big problem like terrorism and crime and call it the most important issue immediately after unemployment and inflation
 yah aam dharna or bahes kaa masalaa bhi he
 Wherever and whenever two people sit in a serious debate on the merger of the country, they do not always fail to show corruption as the main reason for our national plight
 vidambnaa dekhie ki bhrashtachar kii dharna is kadar ghar kar gai he ki ham ab use kisi kalank kii tarah dekhte hai
 However, the Indian people are much more interested in punching others
 ham bhrasht netaaon ko chunaav main jeet dilaate jate hai or sandigdh taur-tareekon se sampatti jamaa karne ko ab kisi tarah ke saamaajik kalank kii tarah nahin dekha jaataa
 Look at the case of two cricket captains, Hansi Cronje of South Africa and our own Mohammad Azharuddin
 chronie or ajaharuddin donon ko unke apane cricket bordon ne match-phixing kaa doshi paaya or 2000 main un par aaajeevan pratibandh laga diya gaya
 Cronje was counted among South Africa's greatest sportsmen but his appeal for rehabilitation was turned down
 unki 2002 main ek vimaan durghatana main maut ho gai
 On the other hand, Azharuddin was elected Congress MP in 2009, that too from Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh, far away from his hometown Hyderabad
 ab unhen haal hi main hyderabad cricket association kaa adhyaksh chun liya gaya
 During the election campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been repeating his government's campaign against corruption
 loksabhaa chunaav main unki ek pasandida daleel yah thi ki ''pichley paanch saal main main unhen jail ke daravaaje tak le aayaa, mujhe paanch saal or dijie ve jail ke andar honge
 "people gave him that time and people have high hopes, at least in this matter
" rojgaar srijan yaa aarthik vruddhi ke maamalon main khaas uplabdhi na hone se modi ne ek baar phir apni sarkaar kii ''bhrashtachar'' ke khilaaf karravaayiyon ko hi apana rajnatik agenda banaaya
 Almost always the tune was played that they would not take rest without "bringing back the spoils of the looted money"
 '' unhone badhati gaiyr-barabari ke khilaaf aam asantosh ko bhi bhunaane kii koshish kii or kaha ki madhya varg ne arthvyavastha main baari yogadan diya lekin zyaadaatar dhan bhrasht netaaon or afasarshahon kii madad se thode-se logon kii jeb main chalaa gaya
 P
 for a few months here
 chidambaram, sharad pavaar, prafull patel, robert wadra, akhilesh yadav jaise kai haai-profile netaaon ke khilaaf kathith bhrashtachar ke aarope main charchit karravaaiyaan dekhne ko mili hai
 Modi continued to sarcasm without naming him, "today all those people have been held accountable, against whom no one dared to take action
" aaj ham dekh rahe hai ki dilli se pune tak bhrasht karrwai jhel rahe hai
 "but there would have been more confidence in Modi's words when his government b

 vaai
 He would have taken equally swift action against the leaders of his party like Chaudhary, who have such or even more serious charges against him
 rafel saude main bhi, achaanak keemat main baari vruddhi or usamen anil ambani kii vivaadaaspad maujuudagi se bade paimaane par lenden kaa andeh he
 But under the guise of national security and a limited order of the Supreme Court, the Modi government defied any investigation
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf muhim main modi sarkaar kii vishwasaneeyata chaahe jo ho or chaahe jaisi chuninda karravaaiyaan hon, jaanch ke daayre main aae logon se kisi tarah kii sahanubhuti rakhana mushkil he
 There should be no sympathy for those who steal or rob or cheat
 or isse bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki bhrashtachar to aam he
 According to a 2018 survey by Transparency International and the community social media network localsircles, 54 percent of Indians believed they had bribed for public services in the last one year, directly or indirectly
 uske pichley saal yah aankada 45 pratishat tha, lekin is badhotaree se bhi chintajanak baat yah he ki kareeb ek tihaai logon kaa maananaa he ki sarkaar main koi kaam karaane ke liye ghoose dena ekmaatr tarika he
 In recent times, industry people have been raising their voice against the so-called 'tax terrorism', which means the swift mobilization of the tax authorities to raise the dues to the government
 kai survey ke mutabik, kar chori bhi behad aam he
 For example, it is believed that Rs 50 lakh
 se 5 karod ru
 Only one in 10 people with income upto actually file tax returns
 yah beshak kar chori kaa saaf-saaf maamla he, lekin aamadani kam dikhaane ke maamle isse bhi zyada hai
 The government is unable to increase capital expenditure, which directly impacts employment generation
 or vah tex or jidipi kaa anupaat badhaane main bhi asamarth he
 Therefore, more speed on this front is understandable
 lekin kya yah 'tex aatankwaad' he?sarkaar apni dey raashi ko jutaney ke liye sakht tareeke apana rahi he
 So it is not surprising that many people feel that the government is showing too much strictness
 aksar tex aatankwaad ke liye coffee de ke sansthaapak ve
 Yes
 siddharth kii aatmahatya kaa udhaaharan diya jaataa he
 People may have become accustomed to keep the dues with the government and often survive by committing large scale tax evasion
 isliye kar adhikariyon kii maujuuda teji ko tex aatankwaad ke rup main dekha jane laga he
 But this is a misinterpretation of tax terrorism
 jo darasal kar vanchanaa ke liye adhik se adhik daron par ugaahi ke taur-tareeke ko jaahir karata he
 Income tax and GST officials are now continuously issuing such notices that the concerned persons reach the respective offices or pay the fine
 lagata he ki aise notice lakhon nahin to hajaaron main to jarur gaye hai
 If bank accounts are now linked to PAN and Aadhaar numbers, then most of the income tax returns should be checked by computer and the discretion of the officers should be removed
 darasal, kar adhikariyon ko kar vanchanaa par focus karnaa chahie, jo hameshaa sidhe-sidhe vanchanaa nahin hoti hai, basharte ham survey par yakeen karen
 Its officers will have to do some more work
 iske baavjood kya kar adhikariyon kii karrwai ko 'tex aatankwaad' kaha ja saktaa he? jab kar vanchanaa aam he to kar adhikariyon kii karrwai main bhi teji aana tay he
 But when there is partiality in such action, then there is a possibility of tax terrorism
 durbhaagya se, modi sarkaar bhrashtachariyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii apni muhim main pakshpaat or bhedbhaav ke bina koshish kii koi vishwasaneey misaal nahin kaayam kar pai he
 The largest or perhaps the only source of funding for political parties is from large industrialists, small businessmen and small contractors, who in turn gain benefits or influence
 bade kaarobaariyon yaa navadhanadhy varg ke bade tabake kii sampatti main ijapha sarkaar se praapt laabh ke jariye hua he, jiske niyantran main vah sab kuch he, jisase kaarobaar badhata he
 From telecom to oil, coal, steel, infrastructure projects and airlines, the government's role is crucial in the success of all
 isi vajah se paisa netaaon or janamat taiyaar karne waalon kii jeb main pahunchataa he
 According to the report titled 'election spending: 2019 election' by the independent think tank Center for Media Studies (CMS), political parties have spent 55,000-60,000 crore in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 kharch kiye
 It is estimated at Rs 30,000 crore spent in the last 2014 Lok Sabha election
 se doguni raashi baithti he
 This means that for every single vote in 2019, Rs 700
 kharch hue
 In 2019, the BJP spent about 45 percent of the total amount spent, while in 1998 its share was only 20 percent
 duusari ore congress ne satta main rahete 2009 ke chunaav main kul chunavi kharch kaa 40 pratishat kharch kiya tha jabaki 2019 main uskaa kharch kareeb 15-20 pratishat baithta he
 This money is coming from somewhere and the reasons are very good
 raajnneeti ke liye paisa maa ke doodh kii tarah he
 In this way, tax terrorism is also a tool to take this flow in favor of someone else and take it away from others
 lekin, jab tak kar chori bade paimaane par hoti rahegi or kar chori kii bhaavana bani rahegi tab tak tex aatankwaad kii anchaahi dharna bhi kaayam rahegi

 *** On one hand, while the Modi government is making it mandatory for national security by making Aadhaar mandatory and insisting on linking it with all facilities including mobile phones, banking, LPG, the politics has also intensified

 Mamta Banerjee also went to the Supreme Court on this matter
 haalanki, somvaar ko supreme court ne unki yachika par sunwaayee karne se inkaar karte hue kaha ki kaise ek rajya kii sarkaar kanoon kaa virodh kar sakati he
 The court asked Mamata Banerjee to file a petition in the court as a person
 mamata ne kya kaha tha?mamata banerjee ne aisa na karne ke peeche kai vajah bhi bataayin
 He said, 'as soon as you link mobile from Aadhaar, they (central Government) will know everything
 ghar main aap kya kha rahe hai
 What are the spouses talking about

 Mamata Banerjee also appealed to the people, while targeting the central government, said, 'I also appeal to others to come forward in this matter

 aksar dilli or haryana ke bich pani kaa vivaad surkhiyon main rahata he
 Both states have been accusing each other of this
 darasal, dilli ko apni pani aavashyaktaa puri karne ke liye rojaanaa padosi rajya haryana se 1133 kusek pani kii jarurat hoti he
 There is a whole controversy about this
 ye panihariyantpane CLC, DSB or yamuna ke jariye dilli ko detaa he
 Haryana gives 683 cusecs of water through CLC
 jabaki DSB ke jariye 330 kusek or yamuna ke jariye 120 kusek pani detaa he
 In this way, a total of 1133 cusecs of water is stored in Okhla, Bawana, Dwarka, Wazirabad, Hyderpur plants of Delhi and is made potable
 jise dilli main jal board supplai karata he
 Significantly, in February this year, the Delhi government approached the NGT on the water problem and accused Haryana that the level of ammonia in Yamuna water has increased manifold
 isaki vajah se dilli vaasiyon ko pani dene main jal board asamarth he
 The Delhi government also said in the NGT that the state official first tried to resolve the problem through negotiations, but when the solution was not found, a petition was filed in the NGT
 yahi nahin ye maamla engiti se badhate-badhate supreme court bhi pahunch gaya
 Eventually, the Supreme Court summoned the state's highest official
 vahiin, haryana ne engiti main or saath hi supreme court main dilli se kai sawaal kiye or baar-baar doharaaya ki wo dilli ko rojaanaa 1133 kusek pani de rahaa he
 Delhi can use the water sent through CLC and DSB directly for drinking
 lekin, wo isko kai duusare kaam jaise kheti ke liye bhi istemaal karata he
 Delhi is not upgrading its plant
 jabaki duusare rajyon main isse kai guna acha plant he jo ki sidhe siver ke pani ko saaf kar sakate hai
 What can they do if there is no water coming from the Hathni Kund
 haryana ne yahaan tak kaha ki ammonia kaa str yamuna ke pani main isliye badha he kyonki yamuna ke pani main bahaav nahin he
 Significantly, a total of 1013 cusecs of water from CLC and DSB comes to Delhi
 lekin, jo 120 kusek pani yamuna ke jariye aata he use pehle wazirabad plant main clin kiya jaataa he
 Water from the Wazirabad plant is directly supplied to North West Delhi, Lutyens Zone, Central and North Delhi
 isliye pichley dinon yahaan pani kii killat hui thi
 However, over time their systems also have to be upgraded
 agar wazirabad plant apgrade hua hota to aaj ye samasya nahin aati

 In 2017, after the farmer agitation, the Congress was whipped by accusing the then Shivraj government of filing false cases against the farmers, that action is now being said by the Kamal Nath government after getting power
 kamalnath sarkaar ke grahamantri bala bachchan ne congress ke hi vidhayak hardip singh dang ke ek sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue bataaya he ki kisaanon par vidhi sammat prakriya anusaar aapraadhik prakaran darj hue
 In fact, Congress MLA Hardeep Singh Dung had asked the question of Home Minister Bala Bachchan that how many peasants have been registered against political farmers in May and June 2017 and what action has been taken by the state government? Home Minister Bala Bachchan has given a written answer to this question that criminal cases have been registered against the farmers at that time under the legal process
 grahamantri bala bachchan ne jab shivaraj sarkaar main kisaanon ke khilaaf hui police kii karrwai ko vidhi sammat bataate hue tatkaaleen bijepi sarkaar ko clinit de di to is par sawaal uthanaa lajimi he
 Now the question is arising whether the Congress lied to bake its political bread in the name of farmers because the Congress had accused the BJP of being anti-farmer and said that the action taken on the farmers was false and this issue in the assembly elections Was also heavily roasted
 vidhansabha main puche sawaal par grahamantri bala bachchan ne vidhayak hardip singh dang ko bataaya he ki kisaanon par darj prakarnon kii vaapasi ke liye disha nirdesh bhi jari kar die gaye hai
 It was also said earlier that while replying to a written question asked by MLA Harsh Gehlot in the Legislative Assembly in February 2019, the Home Minister had said that in June 2017, the police firing on the mhow-neemuch Highway was done under the standard operating procedure of self-defense
 Was taken for bijepi ne ise mandsaur maamle par congress kaa you-turn bataaya tha or us vakt vivaad isliye bhi zyada bad gaya tha kyonki congress ke varisht netaa digvijay singh ne is maamle main khud kii sarkaar ke grahamantri ko katghare main khadaa kar diya tha
 'caught the lie of the Congress' After the legalization of the police action in the then Shivraj government, the BJP has lashed out at the Congress

 This has again become known
 gopal bhargav ne kaha ki congress ek jhooth ko das baar bolkar sach sabit karne kii koshish karti he, lekin janata congress ke jhooth main nahin aane vaali
 He said that the responsible leaders of the Congress should tell that what was said at the time of elections was a lie or what is said about the farmer movement in the Vidhan Sabha today is a lie? The Congress, which is doing politics of lies about farmers, has once again been exposed

 From 1 April 2017, all types of vehicle manufacturers will have to provide complete information about the pollution emissions of the vehicles they manufacture

 The Ministry of Road Transport and Highway has recently revised Form 22 under the Central Motor Vehicle Act

 But you have been amended
 iske tahat vaahan nirmaataa company ko isamen brands chechis number ingine number or utsarjan maanak ke bare main likhit jaankaree deni hogi
 The special thing is that in this form, you will have to write to the automaker how much carbon monoxide, non-methane hydrocarbons, nox, HC + nox, particulate matter is extracting in its smoke
 khaas baat yah he ki gaadi banane vaali company ko ab yah likhakar dena hoga kii uski gaadi main lagaae gaye horn se kitna dhwani pradooshan hota he or yah dhwani pradooshan ke maanakon ke anuroop he yaa nahin he

 If the written data of the vehicle manufacturer is found to be rigging, then any vehicle manufacturer can drag the company to court

 varsh 2004 main samprag sarkaar jab satta main aayi thi to pehali baar iskaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 Sonia Gandhi resigned from the council as well as her membership of the Lok Sabha on 23 March 2006 following a controversy over the post of profit

 The editorial of the organisation's mouthpiece Organizer stated, "can not EVM be manipulated

 'it said,' It is true that man has not built any such machine, which cannot be tampered with
 kisi bhi pranali kii vishwasaneeyata uski paardarshita, pushtataa or vishwaas par nirbhar karti he
 BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad, agreeing with the Sangh's views, said that EVM has been in use for ten years now and the time has come when its credibility is to be analyzed
 yah bhi jaruri he ki ise lekar janata or kuch raajnneetik dalon main vyaapt bhranti ko bhi dur kiya jaae
 Chief Election Commissioner SY Qureshi, however, says that evms cannot be tampered with and is a rigorous test equipment for years
 iske baavjood ayog ne kaha ki vah is mudde par sarvadaleey baithak bula rahaa he or usamen die gaye sujhaavon par vah khule man se vichaar karegaa

 The Sangh said that voters around the world view evms with suspicion
 netherlands, italy, germany or ireland jaise deshon, jinhone shuruuaat main ise lagu kiya tha, iviem ko pratibandhit kar chuke he kyonki unka maananaa he ki isamen aasaani se dhaandhlee ho sakati he
 It said that the Election Commission and the government cannot impose evms as indisputable things on Indian democracy
 yadi loktantr ko gatisheel pranali ke rup main aage badhaana he to sarkaar apni jid ko matadaata par ekmaatr vikalp ke rup main thope nahin sakati
 The mouthpiece stated that evms came into existence due to their own flaws in the ballot system
 matapatron ke jariye hone vaale matdaan main booth par kabje, herapheri, farji voting, mataptr chhinane jaise aarope lage
 In such a situation, EVM was introduced as a more effective tool, but the same complaints also apply to it
 matganana ke samay isamen bhi dhaandhlee ho sakati he
 It said that the system of ballot papers is voter-friendly because whatever is confused, is in the public eye
 iviem ke maamle main usase chhedchhad un logon kii najaron tak simit rahati he jo is pranali kii nigaraanee ke liye sattadhari raajnneetik partiyon kii ore se niyukt hote hai
 The Sangh claimed that the ruling party could disguise evms to achieve the expected results
