 But this is the first time that a sensational video has surfaced of Marshall Kim Jong Un's live encounter from his country
 is video main kim jong un kii sena apane hi ek sainik ko dauda-dauda kar goli maarthe hue dikhaai de rahi he
 It is said that this soldier did not like the security policies of North Korea
 bas usne iske khilaaf munh khol diya tha anjaam ye hua ki baqayada camere par use maut de di gai
 The video has surfaced exposing North Korea's face
 kim ke sainikon ne apane hi saathi ko goliyon se bhun daalaa
 Several shots were fired upon crossing the border
 uttar or dakshin korea ke border se ye sansanikhez video saamne aayaa he
 The first picture is of a car running high speed on the North Korean border
 jo kheton se hote hue dakshin korea ke border kii taraf tezi se badhati chali ja rahi he
 Since the matter is from the border area, this car is being monitored with a camera mounted on the watchtower
 jidhar jidhar ye car ja rahi he, udhar-udhar camere use follow kar rahe hai
 Initially, the speed of the car started causing Shako Shubha that why this car is moving towards the border of South Korea at such a speed
 car kii raftaar is doraahe par aane ke baad thodi dhimi hui magar agle hi pal car chalaa rahe shaks ne stearing bain taraf ja rahi road kii taraf mode diya
 As soon as the car turned to the left, the person sitting in the watch tower in South Korea was alerted
 He started following this car very carefully with his camera
 car jahaan jahaan ja rahi thi camera use follow kar rahaa tha
 And now this car starts running on this bridge built just before the border of South Korea
 ghaney pedo ke bich car bich bich main chup ja rahi thi magar chunki maamla sanjeeda tha, lihaaza use har haal main follow kiya ja rahaa tha
 Let me tell you that the driver of this car is a soldier of North Korean army

 The driver of the car speeded up even more as the South Korea approached the border
 ye dekhie border par uttar korea ke is wo aakhri post ko bhi paar karke aage badhanaa shuru kar diya
 Which is very close to the South Korean border
 is mode par aate hi uttar korian sainik ne car kii raftaar dhimi kii or gaadi ko sadak kinare chhod paidal hi dakshin korea kii taraf bhaagna shuru kar diya
 Seeing this action of his soldier, four soldiers of North Korea deployed on the border rushed towards him
 unhen ummid thi ki wo apane baagi sainik ko pakad lenge
 But by the time all four of them reached the fencing of the border, the rebel soldier of North Korea had gone far ahead
 duusare camere kii footage main dikh rahaa he ki kaise north korea kaa yebaagi sainiksadak kinare car lagaakar tezi se dakshin korea kii fensing kii taraf bhaaga
 But as soon as he reached the spot, his own comrades started firing on him without thinking
 uttar korea ke baagi sainik ke border cross karne kii ye tasviren hairaan karne vaali hai
 The North Korean troops also violated a ceasefire agreement in 1953 to infiltrate their own army soldier and entered part of South Korea
 dakshin korea ke joint chif of staff ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki uttar korea ke seemaa surakshabalon ne apane is sainik ko seemapar karne se rokane ke liye kam se kam 40 goliyaan chalaayin
 North Korean soldiers were shot dead and their rebel soldiers piled on South Korea's land
 or duusari taraf ek darjan uttar korian sainik sarhad ke is paar se uski taraf takataki lagaae dekh rahe the
 But he could not bring his soldier to the other side
 tabhi do or sainik daudte hue aae or dakshin korian seemaa ke nazadik gaye
 But his rebel soldier was far from his reach
 idhar wo sainik aundhe munh padaa hua tha
 Shortly thereafter, South Korean troops from this side of the border swung into action and the rebel soldier of North Korea, who was wounded near Fencing, was dragged by two South Korean soldiers, right inside their border
 sarhad se nikaal kar use fouran nazadiiki aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 Where the doctor managed to save his life after much effort
 magar uski haalat abhi bhi najuk bani hui he

 She wants to come in the mother's lap but it is very difficult to keep her up
 itani choti umr main itnaa zyada vajan dekhakar doctor bhi dang hai
 Because of which the desire is so heavy, it is tried to take a sample of his blood to check it, but the thick skin does not penetrate the syringe

 a post shared by Himanshi Notani (@himanshi_lakhan_notani_11) on Nov 21, 2018 at 10:01pm PST Responding to the discussion of the motion of thanks on the Governor's address in the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that Ram Janmabhoomi is a subject related to faith and the court should also give its verdict on this within 24 hours, respecting public faith
 
 jahaan tak jameen ke bantwaare kaa prashn he to elahabaad ucch nyaayalay pehle hi kah chuki he ki jahaan ramalala ji virajman hai, vahi ram janmabhumi he
 On the Ram temple issue, Yogi said that faith must be respected and the court should respect public faith

 Chief Minister Yogi said that the dispute only had to be decided whether it is Ram Janmabhoomi or not and when it has been decided then the resolution of this dispute should not take 24 hours to 25 hours
 shriram janmabhumi ek aasthaa se judaa vishay he or maa0 nyaayalay ko bhi jan aasthaa kaa sammaan karte hue 24 ghante ke bheetar isapar apana faisla suna dena chahie
 As far as the sharing of land is concerned, the Allahabad High Court has already said that where Ramlala ji is sitting, that is the birthplace of Shri Ram

 The Delhi Police has uncovered a gang of car thieves who, in the blink of an eye, used to steal luxury cars by replacing the ECM chip ie the engine controlling module chip
 is kaam ko anjaam dene ke liye baqayada ek advance diagnostic divaais kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha, jo car ke security system ko niskriy kar detaa he
 Additional DCP Chinmay Viswal of South Delhi said that on the basis of an information, four people, including the head of the gang, were arrested after an encounter at 3 am on Friday
 police team ne car savaar in badmaashon ko jab rukne ke liye kaha, to ve bhaagane lage or police team par firing shuru kar di
 Police retaliated by firing
 haalanki is encounter main kisi ko goli nahin lagi
 According to the police, 3 country pistols, 6 live cartridges and a hitech car diagnostic kit and a dongle have been recovered from the possession of the miscreants
 adishnal disipi chinamay viswal ne bataaya ki is giroh ke sargana kaaron ke ECM or duusare security fitures ko niskriy karne ke liye advance diagnostic divaais kaa istemaal karata tha
 The price of this device made in England is around 3 lakh rupees
 ye gang target kii huikarka bonut kholkar is divaais kii madad se sabase pehle ECM ko jam kar detaa tha or uski jagah par duusari chip laga detaa tha
 This way the emergency message did not reach the car owner
 naa hi GPS kii madad se car ko trek kiya ja saktaa tha
 The second chip or fake ECM had complete programming of the car, due to which all the features of the vehicles worked correctly
 police ke mutabik is giroh kaa sargana ek shaatir apradhi he, jiske khilaaf lagbhag do darjan aapraadhik maamle darj hai
 The police are now making a list of stolen vehicles of this gang
 police kaa makasad un kaaron ko baraamad karnaa bhi he
 The accused are being questioned by the police
 achche dinon kii aas main modi sarkaar kaa saal puraa ho gaya
 The government had come with the intention of spreading good daylight, but even if good days came, it was in darkness
 ek saal puraa hone kaa jashn manaa rahi sarkaar ke grahamantri rajnath singh ke kaarykram main batti gul rahi or andhere main roshni kii chamak media ke camaron kii flash lite se hi ho rahi thi
 In the annual program of the Border Security Force, Home Minister Rajnath Singh came to award the gallantry medals to the police officers
 siarpief ke officers institute ke mess shaury main vishesh kaarykram yojit kiya gaya tha
 The BSF band was playing at the door to welcome the Home Minister and the shadow was dark inside
 andhere main bhaashan dete rahe grahamantriisi andhere main na sirf grahamantri rajnath singh kaa swaagat hua balki bhaashan kii shuruyaat bhi hui
 When Rajnath Singh woke up to give a speech, there was a glimpse of lightning and during the whole speech, electricity was cut six times
 lagbhag dedh ghante tak sarkaar or desh kii simaaon ke rakshakapaseene se tarbatararahe
 The last time Rajnath was trapped in the lift, the thing to do is also that when Rajnath came to attend a function last time in the same institute, the lift got stuck and this time the light went off
 yani rajnath singh ke liye kam se kam yahaan to shuruyaat se hi achche din nahin aae

 The Supreme Court held that a nominee can only accept money deposited in the bank account of a person who has died but cannot claim to be the absolute owner of the money deposited in that account

" ’ unhone kaha, ‘iske tahat nomini ko jamakarta ke khate ke sambandh main adhikaar diye gaye hai lekin isse nomini yah na samajhane lage ki vah maalik ke khate main jamaa dhan kaa swami ho gaya he
 The apex court ruled, rejecting the petition of Ramchandra Talwar, who claimed that since he is the nominee of the account of his deceased mother, his brother or other family members are not entitled to the money deposited in the account

 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi or kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti irani twitor par bhid gaye hai
 Till now, his supporters or devotees used to take charge after the leaders' statements on Twitter, but Smriti Irani has challenged Rahul Gandhi's handle directly
 koi vaaya media nahin
 The tweet comes from the handle of the first office of RG
 
 
 @officeofrg ai ai tii student group ko modi sarkaar kii aalochana ke liye bain kiya gaya he
 What else will we do? phir doosraa twit aata he
 @officeofrg Free expression is our right
 asahmati or bahes ko dabaane ke kisi bhi prayaas ke kilaaf ham ladenge
 After this, Smriti Irani responds by turning over his handle
 @officeofrg kal aapane NSUI se kaha ki jahaan order he vahaan dysorder kar den
 Today your goons came to my house when i was out of work
 @officeofrg apane logon se kahiye ki amethi main aisi koshish hui lekin ve mujhe daraa nahin paae
 They still won't be scared
 @officeofrg mujhe samay or jagah bataaiye main shiksha se lekar garvanence par bahes ke liye taiyaar hum
 @officeofrg Fight your own battle next time
 NSU1 ke peeche chhipakar nahin
 By the way, i am returning to Amethi soon
 vaise dilli chunaav ke vakt kiran bedi ne bahes karne kii chunauti ko sweekaar nahin kiya tha jab kejariwal ne chunauti di thi
 If you remove the record of performing at someone's house, then you will get the name of every party
 kya ek kendriya mantri ko is tarah se chunauti di jaani chahie thi
 If BJP workers now demonstrate, then it will be challenged that the leader should speak up, but what to do, the language of the tweeter becomes personal
 jis tarah se smriti irani ne rahul ko khulkar saamne aane kii chunauti di he, aisa hone laga to partiyon ke netaa ab akhaade main hi mila karenge or unke samarthak yaa sanghathanon ke kaaryakarta tikat kataa kar mukaable kaa anand lenge
 Rahul Gandhi has not responded to Smriti Irani, it may have shocked
 hua yah ki iaiti madras ko 15 may ke din kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantralay kii ek chitthee jaati he ki vahaan ambedkar periyar student cirkil ke chaatr modi sarkaar kii nitiyon kii aalochana kar rahe hai or nafrat failaa rahe hai
 On May 24, IIT Madras Dean Shivkumar M
 Srinivasan sent an email to Ambedkar Periyar Student Circle saying that the recognition of his forum is canceled
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke under secetry ne ek pamfalet bhi natthi kiya gaya tha jisamen modi sarkaar kii corporate parast nitiyon par sawaal uthaaye gaye the
 These pamphlets were sent to the ministry by someone unknown
 apiessi ke sadsy is faisle kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 They say that this has been done on the unknown complaint of the right wing group and their side was not heard from them
 group ne poocha ki kisi agyaat kii chitthee iaiti madras ke bahumat chaatro kaa nazariyaa kaise ho saktaa he
 These students formed this group to spread the ideology of Ambedkar Periyar
 dean ne kaha he ki ye chaatr iaiti ke naam kaa istemaal kar apni gatividhiyaan chalaa rahe the lekin unhone yah bhi kaha ki jaanch ke baad paaya gaya ki unki gatividhiyaan uchit nahin thim
 NSUI members demonstrated at the home of the Union Minister of Human Resources
 pehle smriti irani ne khud ko is vivaad se dur karte hue kaha ki iaiti ek swytt sanstha he, mantralay ko kyon ghasita ja rahaa he
 But that letter of his own ministry started running in the media, on the basis of which the recognition of the discussion group of these students was canceled
 iaiti madras ne kaha he ki wo chaatro kii abhivyakti ko simit nahin karata he
 They are expected to follow the guidelines
 yah saaf nahin he ki iaiti madras kisi pamfalet main modi sarkaar kii nitiyon kii aalochana ko kyon maanata he ki isse campus main sarkaar ke prati nafrat kii bhaavana fail rahi thi
 Now come to the Delhi Government vs Center dispute
 shuukravaar ko is maamle kii supreme court or hai court donon jagahon par alag-alag sandarbhon main bahes hui
 The central government had challenged the remark of the May 25 High Court verdict stating the notification as suspicious that the Anti Corruption Branch may arrest the officers of the Center
 centre kaa kahana tha ki is tippanee ke vakt unka paksh nahin suna gaya
 On this, the Supreme Court ordered that the Delhi High Court, while hearing the petition of the Delhi Government, should separate the comment made in its order of May 25, in which the notification was described as suspicious
 dilli hai court ko dilli sarkaar kii notification radd karne kii yachika par sunwaayee kerani thi, jise 28 may ko daayar kiya gaya tha
 The Supreme Court did not stay a stay on the High Court's comment which was challenged by the Center but also asked to be kept separate
 supreme court ko is par faisla dena he ki anti karpshan beuro kaa dayera kya ho
 The court has asked the Delhi government for its opinion on the right of anti corruption bury in three weeks
 tippaniyan On May 25, the Delhi High Court had said that the Anti Corruption Branch could arrest the officers of the Center
 centre kaa kahana he ki nahin kar saktaa he
 Encouraged by this, the Kejriwal government called a session of the assembly and passed a resolution against the notification and on 28 May filed a petition in the High Court for cancellation of the notification
 supreme court kyon nahin gai yah saaf nahin
 On August 11, the Delhi High Court will hear again, but on Friday the court has not stayed the notification of the Ministry of Home Affairs in its interim decision
 dilli sarkaar se kaha ki pichley dinon hue transfar posting ke adeshon ko up-rajyapal ke paas bheja jaae
 The Deputy Governor can discuss it, if there is an objection, he can send it back to the state government
 centre se halafamana maanga he ki dilli or baaki centre shasit pradeshon main kis tarah se kaam hota rahaa he
 Now you want to see it in terms of defeat and victory, who won in which court or in terms of which direction the matter is moving
 donon hi adaalaton ne apane antarim adeshon main kisi paksh kii baat ko puri tarah se sweekaar nahin kiya he
 Neither the authority of Anti Corruption Branch was considered limited nor the notification of the Center was canceled
 kya dilli hai court ke us faisle se kuch samaj banati he ki dilli sarkaar apane faislon ko up rajyapal ke paas bheje
 If the notification is not canceled, then what is to be believed that the Lt
 Governor will be the Super Boss till the final decision is arrived
 iske baad smriti irani unheen ke handle par palat kar jawaab detii hai
 @officeofrg Yesterday you asked NSUI to disorder where the order is
 aaj aapke gunde mere ghar tab aae jab main kaam se baahar thi
 @officeofrg Tell your people that such an attempt took place in Amethi but they could not scare me
 ve ab bhi nahin daraa paaenge
 @officeofrg Tell me the time and place i am ready for a debate on education to governance
 @officeofrg agali baar se apni ladaai khud ladiye
 No hiding behind NSU1
 vaise main jaldi hi amethi laut rahi hum
 However, during the Delhi elections, Kiran Bedi did not accept the challenge of arguing when Kejriwal challenged
 kisi ke ghar jaakar pradarshan karne kaa record nikaalenge to aapako har party kaa naam milegaa
 Should a Union Minister have been challenged in this way
 kya ab bijepi ke kaaryakarta pradarshan karenge to ye chunauti di jaaegi ki netaa ko bolo saamne aae lekin kya kijiega twitor kii bhashaa personal ho jaati he
 The way Smriti Irani has challenged Rahul to come out openly, if this happens, then the leaders of the parties will now join the arena and their supporters or workers of organizations will enjoy the ticket by cutting the ticket
 rahul gandhi ne smriti irani ko jawaab nahin diya he, ho saktaa he sadma lag gaya ho
 It happened that IIT Madras gets a letter from the Union Human Resource Ministry on May 15 that Ambedkar Periyar Student Circle students there are criticizing the policies of the Modi government and spreading hatred
 24 may ko iaiti madras ke dean sivakumar em shrinivasana ne ambedkar periyar student cirkil ko email bhej kar kaha ki unke forum kii manyata radd kii jaati he
 a pamphlet was also submitted by the Under Secretary of the Ministry of Human Resources in which questions were raised on the corporate policies of the Modi government
 ye pamfalet kisi agyaat ne mantralay ko bheje the
 APSC members are opposing the decision
 inkaa kahana he ki dakshinpanthi samooh kii agyaat shikaayat par aisa kiya gaya he or unase unka paksh bhi nahin suna gaya
 The group asked how the letter of an unknown can be the attitude of majority students of IIT Madras
 in chaatro ne ambedkar periyar kii vichaardhaara ke prasar ke liye yah group banaaya tha
 The dean has said that these students were carrying out their activities using the name of the IIT but they also said that after investigation it was found that their activities were not proper
 enesayuai ke sadasyon ne kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri ke ghar par pradarshan kiya

 Does that decision of the Delhi High Court make some sense that the Delhi Government should send its decisions to the Lieutenant Governor
 agar notification radd nahin hua he to kya mana jaae ki antim faisla aane tak up rajyapal hi super bos honge
 However, during the Delhi elections, Kiran Bedi did not accept the challenge of arguing when Kejriwal challenged

 Now come to the Delhi Government vs Center dispute
 shuukravaar ko is maamle kii supreme court or hai court donon jagahon par alag-alag sandarbhon main bahes hui
 The central government had challenged the remark of the May 25 High Court verdict stating the notification as suspicious that the Anti Corruption Branch may arrest the officers of the Center
 centre kaa kahana tha ki is tippanee ke vakt unka paksh nahin suna gaya
 On this, the Supreme Court ordered that the Delhi High Court, while hearing the petition of the Delhi Government, should separate the comment made in its order of May 25, in which the notification was described as suspicious
 dilli hai court ko dilli sarkaar kii notification radd karne kii yachika par sunwaayee kerani thi, jise 28 may ko daayar kiya gaya tha
 The Supreme Court did not stay a stay on the High Court's comment which was challenged by the Center but also asked to be kept separate
 supreme court ko is par faisla dena he ki anti karpshan beuro kaa dayera kya ho
 The court has asked the Delhi government for its opinion on the right of anti corruption bury in three weeks
 tippaniyan On May 25, the Delhi High Court had said that the Anti Corruption Branch could arrest the officers of the Center
 centre kaa kahana he ki nahin kar saktaa he
 Encouraged by this, the Kejriwal government called a session of the assembly and passed a resolution against the notification and on 28 May filed a petition in the High Court for cancellation of the notification
 supreme court kyon nahin gai yah saaf nahin
 On August 11, the Delhi High Court will hear again, but on Friday the court has not stayed the notification of the Ministry of Home Affairs in its interim decision
 dilli sarkaar se kaha ki pichley dinon hue transfar posting ke adeshon ko up-rajyapal ke paas bheja jaae
 The Deputy Governor can discuss it, if there is an objection, he can send it back to the state government
 centre se halafamana maanga he ki dilli or baaki centre shasit pradeshon main kis tarah se kaam hota rahaa he
 Now you want to see it in terms of defeat and victory, who won in which court or in terms of which direction the matter is moving
 donon hi adaalaton ne apane antarim adeshon main kisi paksh kii baat ko puri tarah se sweekaar nahin kiya he
 Neither the authority of Anti Corruption Branch was considered limited nor the notification of the Center was canceled
 kya dilli hai court ke us faisle se kuch samaj banati he ki dilli sarkaar apane faislon ko up rajyapal ke paas bheje

 When Nitish Kumar and Modi's love story will be written, do not ask me who is Laila and Majnu who is it, you decide
 "asaduddin Owaisi: Laila aur majnu suno jab tumhari dastaan mohabbat ki likhi jaayegi, to mohabbat ka naam nahi likha jaayega us dastaan mein, nafrat ka naam likha jaayega tumhari dastaan mein, likhega ki jab se ye dono ek saath aaye, Hindustan mein hindu-muslim tanav mein hai

 "according to the newspaper," pakistan-us relationship against terrorism is on the verge of collapse

 Taking a dig at this, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that this plan of the Congress is a hoax and a hoax
 unhone kaha, 'congress kaa itihaas garibi or garibi hataane ke naam par raajnneetik vyavsaay kaa rahaa he
 Their history has not been to eradicate poverty, but to deceive in the name of schemes
 congress chunaav to garibi hataao ke naam par jiti thi, lekin us kaarykaal main keval garibi kaa vitaran hua tha
 The Congress never brought any policy related to the work required for poverty alleviation, boosting the economy, increasing income in the society
 'vitt mantri ne kaha, 'congress ke kaarykaal main chal-kapat, dhokhaa hota rahaa he
 In 2008, it was said that loan waiver of 70 thousand crores was waived, but loan waiver was of 52 thousand crores and in this too the benefit of big traders of Delhi was given
 ''congress kii niti rahi he ki chunaav jeetne ke liye garib ko dhokhaa dena or saadhan na dena
 The history of the Congress Party has been to give slogans to the poor and vote for means
 '- congress ne kisi kaa rin maaf nahin kiya - Even today, the assembly where the debt is waived - abhi tak karnataka 2600 hajaar karod, empi 3000 karod punjab ne 5500 hajaar (congress kii sarkaar ne jo karj maaf kiya abhi tak) - The history of the Congress party has been that they should not give any means to the poor - karj maafee ke naam par congress ne dhokhaa kiya - Congress also manipulated MNREGA - aadhaar ko rokane kii koshish - What Rahul Gandhi said today that he will give 6 thousand per month
 iskaa matlab he ki vitt ghaataa hoga
 But everyone is saying that this will not happen

 The Bharatiya Janata Party has suffered the biggest blow in the assembly elections, which are being treated like semi-finals before the Lok Sabha elections in 2019
 chhattisgarh, rajasthan or madhya pradesh main bhartiya janata party kii satta haath se phisal gai he or congress ne ek baar phir dam dikhaaya he
 While BJP had an army of star campaigners like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP President Amit Shah, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the lone President, Rahul Gandhi, took over the front from the Congress
 rahul ne is jang main bijepi ko chitt kar sabit kar diya he ki vah kisi se kam nahin hai
 Rahul became Leader of Opposition No
1! In the first Gujarat Assembly Election, it has been decided that Rahul Gandhi is the Leader of the Opposition by the BJP in Karnataka, then forming the government in Karnataka and now defeating BJP directly in three states
 rahul ke netritv par samay-samay par sawaal uthte rahe the, lekin rahul gandhi ne adhyaksh pad sanbhaalane ke baad jis tarah se nattejey die hai usase sabhi sawaal band ho gaye hai
 Not only the opposition but parties like Shiv Sena, JDU are also now saying that Rahul Gandhi's politics has matured
 vidhansabha chunaav main mili jeet ke baad ab vipaksh puure utsaah ke saath sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main pravesh karegaa
 That is, in the winter session, the opposition led by Congress will take an aggressive stand against the Modi government
 rafel, sibiai, arabiai, bhrashtachar jaise mudde ab modi sarkaar kii pareshaani sansad satr main badha sakate hai
 No one has majority in MP, efforts to form government intensified
 
 
 live apadatsismen to koi andeh nahin ki is jeet ke baad rahul gandhi ko narendra modi se ladane kii nai raajnneetik shakti mili he
 The results of the assembly elections have also made it clear that now the 2019 Lok Sabha elections are going to be even more stringent
 kyonki ek taraf pradhanmantri narendra modi honge to duusari taraf jeet se labalab rahul gandhi
 What are the things from the results of the assembly elections that make Rahul Gandhi the biggest player
 yahaan padhein
 
 
 1
 2019 main narendra modi ke saamne ab vipaksh ke netaa ke taur par rahul gandhi hi ubhar kar aae hai
 That is, Rahul Gandhi is the leader of the opposition number one
 2
 This is the first time in the last few years that the Congress has defeated the Bharatiya Janata Party in a direct fight
 3
 The Congress's direct victory also shows that it is not necessary that only the Grand Alliance is needed to defeat the BJP
 chunavi nateezon ko dekhen to congress ke liye abhi to sabase badi baat he ki bijepi haar gai
 What will happen in 2019 will be seen further
 lekin massej to saaf chalaa gaya he ki 2019 jitna aasaan narendra modi ke liye mana ja rahaa tha, utana aasaan ab nahin rahegaa
 The public liked Rahul's tartar Tevarrahul Gandhi took an aggressive stand against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in every election rally
 rafel kaa mudda, sansthaaon ko dabaane kaa mudda, sibiai, arabiai samet kai ahm binduon par congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi puri tarah se aakraamak dikhe
 The promise of loan waiver within 10 days also appealed to the public and Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh were put in the Kokkresski
 chhattisgarh main rahul gandhi kaa hi jaadu tha ki congress adhyaksh kii 20 reliyon ke dam par bina chehre vaali party ko 67 siten milin
 Apart from Chhattisgarh, Rahul's roadshow rally in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh has done wonders
 jeet ke baad dikhaaya bada dilrahul gandhi ne teen rajya main badi jeet hasil karne ke baad bhi media se baat kii
 He expressed his heartfelt thanks to all the BJP governments in the three states for their work after the victory and promised to carry it forward
 vahiin, rahul ne ye bhi kaha ki vah 'bijepi mukt bharat' nahin chaahate hai

 Just the last line in which Dhoni is described as a helpless helpless mother, it is contrary to the scenario to leave a Yuvraj who was relatively weak after switching to BCCI was the choice of the selectors contrary to Dhoni's wish, otherwise Ravindra Jadeja And what has been carried for years by mediocre players like Suresh Raina only because of the Indian captain
 yahi kamobase shikhar dhawan or rohit sharma ke liye bhi kaha ja saktaa he jo, manish pandeya or pichley ipel ke saphaltam openar robin uthppa kii jagah maar kar bhartiya prashansakon or khel premiyon kii chaati par mung dal rahe hai
 No harm if the captain gets the player of his choice, but with accountability for the performance

 In all respects, Ajinkya Rahane is being seated in the dug-out for all three, what could be more ironic! If Kohli alone did not perform miraculously, then the team players would sit in their drawing room and watch the semi-finals on TV and the captain, whose hopes are being held again on April 3 to hold the cup, would have become a distant penny
 And Dhoni, on the contrary, would have announced his future

 Kohli is not a robot, a bone-meat man and may fail in the next matches, but even if India manages to repeat the history of 2007, the credit will go to Virat Kohli, due to which the team India has reached the dream of defeating the West Indies by reaching here today and is also hoping that Sunday will be the same day at the Eden Gardens

 hegade kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ke sadasyon se hui aakhri baithak ke baad nahin lagata ki donon pakshon kii aapasi baatcheet se koi rasta nikalegaa
 Hegde said that in such a situation, a question has arisen on the formation of powerful laws
 hegade ke mutabik sarkaar pradhanmantri, nyaaypalika or sena ke dwaara kharid-farokht ko jaanch ke daayre se baahar rakhana chaahati he
 Today CBI has been kept out of the purview of RTI, tomorrow it can be said that the police should also be kept out of this scope
 hegade ne yah bhi kaha ki sarkaar ko ek na ek din yah ehsaas jarur hoga ki vah ek acha kaam kar sakate the lekin unhone mauka ganvaa diya
 On the other hand, Justice Hegde also said that he had no differences with Anna Hazare
 agar anna hazaare anshan karte hai to vah unke saath hai
 Just before the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, there is no name of political discord in the state's most powerful political Yadav family

 Everything belongs to Netaji

 Have i worked less than CM

 On the existence of Samajwadi Party: Mulayam i know that the socialist party can never be broken

 We have to overcome our weakness and quit fighting each other

 On Amar Singh: Akhilesh, some people are working against me and Netaji

 Amar Singh's statement was shocking to me
 amar singh khalanaayakahain
 Mulayamar Singh is my brother
 amar singh ke khilaaf main ek shabd nahin sun saktaa
 Amar Singh has helped us many times
 use gaali dete ho
 If Amar Singh had not saved me, i would have been sentenced to seven years
 tum kisi ko gaali doge to kya wo tumhaare pair chhuegaa
 Shivpal was formed in 2003 with the help of Amar Singh
 siem kii shah par afasaron ne meri baat nahin maani
 Some people are not equal to the dust of Amar Singh's feet

 On the blindness in the party: Are Mulayam (from Akhilesh) helping the gamblers and alcoholics? Can you win an election alone? What is your status Will take out slogans naare lagane waalon ko pataa he kya, ham kaise lade hai
 If Shivpal needs it, we will remove people from the party
 netaji ne party ko khadaa karne main kaaphi sangharsh kiya
 Where the party stands today, it is only because of Netaji
 maine bhi party ke liye bahut yogadan diya he
 Indiscipline will not be tolerated
 akhileshsajeesh karne waalon par karrwai hui he
 Netaji told me that why don't you save Prajapati
 netaji ne mujhase kaha ki siem bachaayegaa to prajapati batch jayega
 But i told him that he does not listen to me
 mulaayam ke kehane par akhilesh chachaa shivpal ke gale bhi mili lekin iske baad donon ek duusare ke gale pad gaye
 The two were openly debated on stage and the scuffle ensued

 ’10- pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘hamen suraksha parishad sahit sanyukt raashtra kaa sudhaar karnaa hoga
 The United Nations is going to celebrate its 70th anniversary next year, of which India is a founding member, it would be appropriate that by 2015, the UN Security Council make necessary reforms

 Tremors of a magnitude 5 earthquake were felt
 ab sawaal yah he ki bukamp kii asli vajah tectonical platon main tej halchal hoti he
 Not only that, there are also earthquakes due to meteor impact and volcanic eruptions, mine testing and nuclear testing
 duniya bhar main har saal kareeb lakhon bukamp aate hai, lekin inaki tivrata kam hoti he
 Because of this we are not able to feel them
 neshnal arthquek information centre har saal kareeb 20,000 bukamp record karata he, jisamen se 100 bukamp aise hote hai, jinase nuksaan hota he
 Such measurements measure seismic intensity seismographs are used to determine the intensity and duration of earthquakes
 is yantra ke jariye dharti main hone vaali halchal kaa graph banaaya jaataa he, jise seismogram kehete hai
 Based on this, the intensity of earthquake waves, the epicenter of the earthquake and the energy emanating from it are determined through mathematical scales (richter scale)
 seismograph kaa ek hissaa aisa hota he, jo bukamp aane par bhi nahin hilta or anya hisse hilne lagate hai
 The part that does not move keeps on recording the intensity of the earthquake
 isi ke aadhaar par seismogram taiyaar hota he, jo bukamp kii sateek jaankaree hasil karne main madad karata he
 The Richter scale measuring it was developed by American scientist Charles Richter in the year 1935
 richter scale par prayek agali ikai pichhali ikai kii tulana main 10 guna adhik tivrata rakhti he
 2 on this scale
 0 yaa 3
 An earthquake of magnitude 0 is mild, while 6
 2 kii tivrata kaa matlab shaktishaalee bukamp hota he
 Terrible earthquakes can come in 2018, these changes are happening in the Earth, in 2018, there may be catastrophic earthquakes in many parts of the world
 bukamp par research kar rahi jiyological sosayadi of america ke vaigyanikon ne yah chetavanee jari kii he
 They say that the speed of the Earth is changing, due to which there is a possibility of earthquake
 prithvi ke ghoomane kii raftaar se bhi he bukamp kaa sambandhreport ke mutabik prithvi ke ghoomane kii raftaar se bhi bukamp kaa sambandh hota he
 This conclusion has been made by Roger Bilham of the US University of Colorado and Rebecca Bendick of the University of Montana in the research on earthquakes
 donon vaigyanikon ne is research ke liye 1900 saal pehle aae sabhi bade bukampon kaa gahan adhyayan kiya
 According to them, in the last five years, the incidence of turmoil inside the world has increased
 pehle bhi isi vajah se aae the bukampavaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki pichhali sadi main prithvi kii ghoomane kii raftaar ke fark aane ke kaaran kareeb paanch baar 7
 There were 0 earthquakes of magnitude
 is sadi main bhi beete paanch saal main duniya bhar main dharti ke andar uthal-puthal kii ghatnaayen hui he
 Due to which there is a possibility that big earthquakes may occur in 2018
 haalanki, kin ilaakon main bukamp aaenge yah research main saafe nahin ho sakaa he
 But it is definitely seen that the length of day is getting shorter and larger in the areas around the equator

 Pakistan said that Modi's statement provides evidence of India's negative role against a sovereign neighboring country
 pakistan ke videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa kaaji em khalilullah ne kaha, 'bharat ke netaa ne naa sirf sanyukt raashtra ke charter kaa ulanghan kiya he, balki duusare deshon ke aantarik maamalon main hastkshep karne main gauravanvit bhi mahasoos karte hai
 Khalilullah said that Pakistan believes in peaceful cooperation and wants to maintain good neighborly relations with India, but the description of bilateral relations by Prime Minister Modi as a nuisance is unfortunate
 unhone kaha, 'pakistan or bangladeshke log naa sirf dharmik atmiyata ke bandhanon se bandhe hue hai, balki aupniveshik shashan ke khilaaf apane swatantraaa sangharsh ke itihaas ke jariye bhi aapas main jude hue hai

 To confirm his claim, CBI Deputy Superintendent Anuj Arya contacted Nalini Singh and asked for a list of Nepali songs aired on TV

 sibiai ne nalini singh ko yah bhi bataaya ki agle kuch din main ve hatyare ko pahchaan lenge
 CBI Inspector Anuj Arya also told Nalini Singh that there were three outside servants along with the Talwar couple, Aarushi and Hemraj in the house on the night of the murder

 Realme x was launched in India on July 15 this year
 is smartphone ko bharat main 16,999 rupee main launch kiya gaya tha
 We have spent about 1 month with this smartphone and now we are going to share its review with you
 hamane is smartphone ke 8GB+128GB verient kaa rivyuu kiya he, jaaniye kya is smartphone main aapako paisa lagaana chahie?dizin or disple:realme x ke back panel kii sabase pehle baat karen to yahaan dual tone gradient panel diya gaya he
 This panel is glossy, in such a way fingerprints start appearing here without touching the cover
 yahaan rier main dual camera seoup diya gaya he, jise vertical shape main rakhaa gaya he
 Flash is also present here along with the camera
 phone slik bhi he kairi karne main aasaan bhi he
 Just a few people may have trouble handling one hand
 rhite panel main yahaan power batan or sim trey ko rakhaa gaya he
 There is a tray for only two Nano sims
 yani aap memory card kaa istemaal is phone main nahin kar sakate
 Other than the type-c port in the rest of the bottom panel, the bottom firing speakers and 3
 5mm jaik ke liye bhi port diya gaya he, joki acchhee baat he
 Talking about the top panel, a pop-up selfie camera has been given here
 vahiin left panel main yahaan wolum rockers hai
 Talking about the display, here 6 with Gorilla Glass 5
 53-inch phul-hd+ OLED disple diya gaya he
 Here, there will be no notch due to the pop-up selfie camera in the front panel
 bottm main bejals bhi kaaphi kam he
 That is, you will be able to enjoy any content in a very fun way
 colors kaaphi brit, vivid or panchi hai
 They can be easily used in any light
 yahaan disple main hi fingerprint sensors bhi diya gaya he, joki kaaphi fast he
 The overall look and design is quite impressive
 software or parformens:sabase pehle parformens kii baat karen to yahaan company ne snapadragon 710 procesar kaa istemaal kiya he
 Which is really a very good processor in this price range
 aapako bataa den google ke kifayati 'premium' smartphone Pixel 3a main snapadragon 670 procesar miltaa he or Realme x kaa kareebi pratidwandi Redmi Note 7 Pro snapadragon 675 procesar ke saath aata he
 With the Snapdragon 710 processor, there will be no lag or shutter or heating problems in app switching or multiple operation
 ye smartphone kaaphi smood tareeke se kaam karata he
 This smartphone is also much better for gamers
 yahaan Adreno 616 GPU ke saath kooling gel technology kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 Also Hyperboost 2 in software
 0 or Game Boost 2
 Gaming modes like 0 are also provided
 aise main gaming ko lekar aapako koi shikaayat nahin aegi
 Talking about the software, Android 9 Pie based coloros 6 has been given in it
 software ko yahaan naa acha kaha ja saktaa he naa bura
 Usually all Android custom uis in this price range are the same, if they are not stock Android
 custom UI ke maamle main oneplus behatar kaam karata he
 Although talking about Realme X, here are two things better, that is, you can delete unwanted apps
 yani blottware kii shikaayat dur kii ja sakati he or doosraa yahaan Xiaomi kii tarah aapako dheron Ads nahin milenge
 Camera: 48MP primary camera (sony IMX 586) and 5MP secondary camera are given in its rear
 soni IMX 586 oneplus 7 siries se lekar Oppo Reno tak main miltaa he
 However, the performance of the camera cannot be categorized as one
 is smartphone main bhi baaki 48MP camere vaale smartphone kii hi tarah 1 / 2
 a 0-inch sensor is available, which uses pixel binning technology
 baharhaal sidhi bhashaa main camere ke parformens kii baat karen to bheed se kuch zyada alag to nahin he, lekin haa kuch had tak keemat ke lihaaj se behatar he
 The camera is better in daylight and the camera performance is better than the old smartphones of Reality in low-light
 sabase khaas parformens potrate mod main dekha ja saktaa he
 Generally, smartphones in this range do not perform well in camera portraits, but its work is amazing
 vahiin chroma boost, HDR or seen rikgnishan bhi camere ko behatar tareeke se madad karte hai
 For the 48MP camera you do not get direct access here, for this you will need to go into settings and turn on 48MP mode
 iske alaava camera ap main nitscape, slo moshan, export or panorama jaise mod bhi milenge
 Its nightscape mode is not much better, but in terms of price is fine
 oneplus 7 Pro main bhi yahi soni sensor he lekin uskaa nitemod kamaal kaa he, haalanki uski keemat bhi zyada he
 This is to say that the Sony IMX 586 sensor can be optimized a little bit better at this price
 selfi kii baat karen to yahaan f / 2
 a 16MP camera (sony IMX 471) with 0 aperture is given and it is also better
 yahaan selfi potrate bhi keemat ke hisaab se acha he
 That is, overall the camera is also good somewhere
 photo sample:- imagej web ke liye risise kii gayi hai
 Battery: Realme x battery is 3765mah and here VOOC 3
 0 flash charge kaa saport diya gaya he
 Due to fast charging, it can be charged up to 0-93% in about an hour
 baaki regular se heavi yuj main ise kareeb 12 se 14 ghanton tak chalaaya ja saktaa he
 That is, the battery is also good
 faisla:realme bharat ke bajet or mid range segment main apni behatar jagah banane main bahut jaldi kaamyaab rahaa
 The reason was that it directly targeted the budget leader Xiaomi
 kaaphi aankh michauli ke baad rialami ne ek aisa smartphone utaara, jisamen mid range segment yani 16,999 rupee main bahut kuch de diya gaya
 To some extent, it is competing with Redmi Note 7 Pro, but still it is ahead in many cases
 philhal Oppo K3 bhi isi spacifications or isi price range main aata he, lekin usamen 48MP camera rier main nahin miltaa he
 Realme x is one of the best smartphones to take for such features as its Snapdragon 710, pop-up selfie camera, 48MP rear camera, premium look, in-display fingerprint sensor, full view display and fast charging support
 keval camera parformens ko or behatar kiya ja saktaa he

 Hindi was given official language status on 14 September 1949
 tab se har saal yah din 'hindi diwas' ke taur par manaaya jaataa he
 But do you know why Hindi day is celebrated? There is a reason behind this
 aaie jaanate hai
 
 
 In the year 1947, when India moved from English rule, the biggest question was about the language in front of it
 kyonkibharatamen saikadon bhashaaen or boliyaan boli jaati he
 The Constitution was constituted on 6 December 1946 to prepare the Constitution of independent India
 samvidhan sabha ne apana 26 november 1949 ko samvidhan ke antim praaroop ko manjuuri de di
 The Constitution of independent India came into force from 26 January 1950 across the country
 lekin bharat kii koun si rashtrabhasha chuni jaaegi ye mudda kaaphi ahm tha
 After much thought, Himdi and English were chosen as the languages of the new nation
 samvidhan sabha ne devanagari lipi main likhi hindi ko angrajon ke saath raashtra kii aadhikarik bhashaa ke taur par sweekaar kiya tha
 On September 14, 1949, the Constituent Assembly decided by one vote that Hindi will be the official language of India
 desh ke pehle pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ne kaha ki is din ke mahatv dekhte hue har saal 14 sitambar ko hindi diwas manaaya jaae
 The first Hindi day was celebrated on 14 September 1953
 angreji bhashaa ko lekar hua virodh14 sitambar 1949 ko samvidhan sabha ne ek mat se nirnay liya ki hindi hi bharat kii rajbhasha hogi
 Protest demonstrations started in some parts of the country on the news of the removal of the English language
 tamilnadu main janvari 1965 main bhashaa vivaad ko lekar dange hue the
 In 1918, Mahatma Gandhi asked Hindi language to be the national language in Hindi Hindi language
 ise gandhi ji ne janamanas kii bhashaa bhi kaha tha
 The controversy of BJP candidate Sadhvi Pragya Singh's statement on Nathuram Godse, the murderer of Mahatma Gandhi, was not even quiet enough that a controversy has emerged from Surat in Gujarat
 surat ke limbayat ilaake main mahatma gandhi ke hatyare nathuram godse kaa janmdin manaaya gaya jiske baad nathuram godse ko lekar ek baar phir nayaa vivaad shuru hua he
 This is the same Suryamukhi Hanuman temple situated in the Limbayat area of surat where the birthday celebration of Mahatma Gandhi's killer Nathuram Godse was celebrated on the night of May 19, these people of the All India Hindu Mahasabha in the temple's courtyard put a photo of Nathuram Godse on the birth anniversary Observed and sweetened each other
 godse kii puja karte lograshtrapita mahatma gandhi ke hatyare nathuram godse kaa janmotsav manaae jane kii khabar jab soshil media ke madhyam se faili to gujarat sarkaar harakat main aa gai thi, gujarat sarkaar ne nathuram godse kaa janmdin manaane waalon ke saamne kanoonee kaarywahi karne ke liye surat police ko aadesh jari kiya
 Surat Police Commissioner Satish Sharma registered a case against the people celebrating the birthday of Nathuram Godse at the Limbayat police station in Surat city and arrested 6 people
 police dwaara giraftaar kiye gaye sabhi aaropee akhil bhartiya hindu mahasabha ke kaaryakarta hai
 The surprising thing is that these are the same Gujarat of Gandhi where Gandhi was born and from where Gandhiji had given freedom to the country through the Satyagraha, Gandhian to celebrate the birthday of Gandhi's killer in this same Gujarat
 People are quite angry
 gandhi samarthakon main in logon ke khilaaf kaaphi gussa he
 On the one hand, through Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, Gandhi's killer was described as a devotee, on the other hand, the birthday of Gandhi's killer Godse was celebrated in this way
 aise main sawaal yahi khadey hote hai ki agar log gandhi ke jivan ko samaj nahin paae the to kam se kam unke mulyon ko samaj lete to aisi harakatein nahin karte

 He said, 'it is very important for me to get a good rhythm
 is siries ke dauraan mujhe shuruaati spel main vah lay nahin mil rahi he
 i am finding some overs to be frozen only after which i am able to bowl well
 ’unhone kaha,‘yah acchhee lay hasil karne kii baat he or main isi kii koshish kar rahaa hum
 Being in rhythm i can annoy any batsman in the world
 main ek ranneeti ke saath is siries main aayaa tha jisaki shuruyaat pichley saal bangalore main ken williamsan ke wicket ke saath hui
 i repeated it in this series as well
 ’ mohammad shami or umesh yadav ko wicket nahin mil sake lekin aswin ne donon tej gendbaajon kii tarif kii
 He said, 'it is a very difficult wicket to bowl and their support was very important
 donon ne subah umdaa gendbaaji kii
 Umesh bowled very fast throughout the day
 ummid he ki duusari pari main unhen wicket milenge

 'he said,' It is a matter of achieving a good rhythm and i am trying to do the same
 lay main hone par main duniya ke kisi bhi ballebaaj ko pareshaan kar saktaa hum

 ) As soon as the arrival of monsoon in Chhattisgarh, even the birds get worried about their shelter
 pradesh ke gramin ilaakon main nikalate hi vivar bird (baya) bhi apana ashiana banaate dikh jaati he
 In the absence of lush green trees in the capital city Raipur and urban areas, they nest in small trees along the roads and trees in the middle of fields
 apane parivaar ke liye chintit pehali barish se hi inaki taiyaari shuru ho gai thi
 Many nests have also been prepared
 inke ghonslon kii raunak dekhte hi banati he
 According to the state's bird experts, Baya prepares her nest very carefully to avoid the monsoon rains
 sabase rochak baat yah he ki nar baya ghonslaa banaate samay maadaa ko aakarshith karata he
 When the nest is half ready, the female bayan inspects it
 iske baad hi baya apane ghonsle kaa upyog karte hai
 It is not used when the female baya 'rejects' the nest
 yahi vajah he ki pedo ke ghonslon ke jhund ke bich kai adhure ghonsle bhi najar aate hai
 The texture of their ghouls is also beautiful and attractive
 pakshiyon ke awaas or vyavhaaron par saat varshon se lagaataar adhyayan kar rahe naayab tehseeldaar anubhav sharma ne bataaya ki vivar bird (baya) pehle yun to zyaadaatar shahari ilaakon main hi dikhti thi, par ab paryaavaran ke dushprabhav or shahari ilaakon main ghatati hariyaali ke chalate yah lagaataar rahawashi ilaakon se dur hoti ja rahi hai
 Due to the concern of her eggs, she makes her nest in large and high trees
 kabhi kabhaar shahar ke hariyaali vaale ilaakon main oonche vrikshon par bhi baya ke ghonsle dekhe jate hai
 According to experts, the task of building nests is on the male bay
 ye apana ghonslaa barish se bachane ke liye teen-chaar din main taiyaar kar lete hai
 Baya use their nests just once
 baya gauraiya kii tarah dikhti he
 They look yellow at the time of breeding, the rest is brown in color
 zyaadaatar ye shaharon ke aas-paas yaa nagar ke hariyaali vaale ilaakon main bade vrikshon par hi ghonslaa banaate hai
 It is said that Baya takes special care of security in building her colony
 sadak kinare ke bade pedo main oonchai vaale sthanon main ye sadak ke thik peeche ashiana sajaate hai, kyonki vaahanon kii awajahi se ghonsle ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 They are most vulnerable to snakes, so they build their nest on tall trees
 ghonsle ke gol hisse main maadaa baya apane andon ko chhipaakar rakhti hai
 They leave the nest with their children as soon as the monsoon ends
 pradesh ke kuch ilaakon ke kisaanon kaa kahana he ki aamtaur par jab baya apane ghosle bananaa prarambh karti hai to kisaan samaj jate hai ki monsoon kareeb he
 Simga farmer Sunil Banjare says that this time due to the onset of the pre-monsoon, Baya's nests are not showing in the same number as they used to show in other years

 grih mantralay kii ek report ke mutabik pichley 3 saal main surakshabalon ne jammu kashmir main 586 aatankwaadiyon ko alag-alag oparation main dher kiya he

 Recently a picture has been shared on social media, in this black and white picture, Sridevi is seen with a little girl
 sabase badi baat ki ye bacchee shridevi kii donon betiyaan jahnavi, khushi nahin hai
 This little girl is none other than Queen Ekta Kapoor of the TV industry
 Woman’s day is everyday!!! But today I’ll remember a woman who gave me a childhood joy like no other! i lost touch with her when i grew up but the fat child in me had a silent approval of India’s first female superstar! My mom will always b my biggest hero but this woman’s day is for that hero who first showed me ‘ strong women support women( even if she is much younger) # ripsridevi # ladysuperstara post shared byek-kehnekohumsafarhai❤️(@ektaravikapoor) onmar 7, 2018 at 10:00pm pstekawa kapur ne is tasviir ko khaas vumans de ke din share kiya he

 Ekta then gave the trollers a befitting reply

 This is a game of luck and not what the rumors are saying !!! khaadya suraksha bill ko lekar sarkaar sansad kaa vishesh satr bulaane kii taiyaari kar rahi he or 7 june ko ise lekar ek sarvadaleey baithak hogi
 The Congress core group was very concerned about this matter and it was decided to call a special session of Parliament
 vishesh satr ke liye duusari partiyon se baat kii jimmedaari kamalnath ko saunpi gai he
 If the session is not successful, then the government can bring an ordinance
 sutron ke anusaar kor group kii baithak main mantrimand vistaar kii bhi charchaa hui or mana ja rahaa he ki is cabinet vistaar bhi agle hafte kiya ja saktaa he
 The Prime Minister had indicated last week that his government would soon formulate a strategy to pass the Food Security Bill and the Land Acquisition Bill soon
 khaadya suraksha vidheyak or bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak ko congress dwaara loksabhaa chunaavon main chamatkaar ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 The food bill is primarily the brainchild of Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 sarkaar is vidheyak ke liye adhyadesh laane ko uchit vikalp nahin maan rahi he kyonki iske jariye labhaarthiyon ko kanoonee adhikaar nahin diya ja saktaa
 Therefore, the government can call a special session of Parliament to get it passed

 court ne kaha- tay samay main sabhi pakshakaar apni daleel puri karenmuslim paksh ne rakhi babari masjid ke vaidhata kii daliyodhya vivaad par rojaanaa sunwaayee jari he
 When the Muslim party argued Babur in the Supreme Court during the 34th day hearing on Monday, the court stated in clear words that they are not sitting here to calculate Babar's sinful virtue
 court ne saaf-saaf phir kaha ki unke paas samay nahin he
 All parties should complete their arguments in the same amount of time
 34 wein din kii sunwaayee ke dauraan muslim paksh ne supreme court kii samvidhan peeth ke saamne babari masjid kii islamic kaayade kii vaidhata or nirmohi akhaade ke kabje ke kanoonee pench par apni daleelein rakhin
 Senior advocate Shekhar Nafde started the debate on behalf of the Muslim parties
 nafde ne kaha ki court par maamla tay samay seemaa main khatm karne kaa pressure he
 Shekhar Nafde argued that the entry of Hindus into the disputed area in 1885 was confined only to the Ram Chabutara and Sita kitchen located in the outer courtyard
 hindu ram chabutara ko janmasthan kehete the
 The rest of the place was a mosque, where Muslims performed namaz
 nafde ne kaha ki muslim kabze kaa daawa kar sakate he yaa nahi, vahaan par masjid thi or usko 1885 main chalange nahin kiya gaya tha
 The presence of the mosque was considered, the Judicial Commissioner clearly stated in the report that Hindus want to increase the right to come
 raghubardaas ke mahant hone ko sabhi ne mana or usko kisi ne bhi chalange nahi kiya tha
 The 1885 decision also says the same
 shekhar nafde ne kaha ki sawaal yah nahi court ne kya kaha sawaal yah he ki yachikaakarata ne court ko kya bataaya, nirmohi akhaada ne bhi unako mahant mana tha
 Nafam Pasha, a lawyer for the Muslim parties, finished his argument, while Nizam Pasha started arguing on behalf of another party, Misbahuddin
 nizaam pasha ne kaha ki babar jab raaj kar rahaa tha to wo samprabhu tha
 Was not accountable to anyone
 quran or islamic kanoon ke hisaab se usne raaj kiya
 Opposition parties are saying that Babur committed sin by building a mosque, but we say he did not commit any sin
 justise bobade ne poocha- ham yahaan badshaah babar ke paap yaa punya kaa faisla karne nahin baithe hai ham to yahaan kanoonee kabje ke daawey ke pareekshan karne baithe hai
 Nizam Pasha said that Nirmohi means without attachment and the recluse lives in disinterest, then what is his fascination and raga? Meanwhile, Ramlala Virajman said in the Supreme Court that we will not participate in mediation
 virajman ke vakeelon ne kaha ki ve madhyasthata nahin chaahate
 Let this court decide
 is par court ne kaha ki vah sunwaayee kar rahaa he or ab 18 oktober tak bahes hogi
 The court declined to comment on the arbitration

 antarrashtriya samudaay ne bhi is baat ko vyapak taur par sweekaar kiya he
 We are taking the entire issue of infiltration seriously
 ham chaukanne hai or nigaraanee kii lagaataar jarurat he
 Earlier, the Home Secretary had said that efforts were being made to cross the border before the snow melt

 Today is the term that came into existence after the Indian Air Force entered Pakistan and dropped the bomb
 bharat ke videsh sachiv ne ise a-sainya karrwai kaha he
 In English it is called non-military
 is shabd main kootnithik kalakaari he
 Bomb-laden combat aircraft enter Pakistan's border, return safely without any damage by dropping bombs and be told that it was un-military action, then one should smile
 military bhi non-military kaam to karti hi he
 There is no need to hurt the dictionary to understand its meaning
 polytics ko samajhane kii zarurat he
 But there was a mistake
 kamaal bhartiya vayusena kaa rahaa lekin khabar brake pakistan kii sena ne kii
 India's journalists sleep long
 vaise bhi subah channelon main jyotish ankar hote hai
 Can smile at this too
 pehali khabar pakistan ke sainik pravaktaa major general gafoor ne 5 bajkar 12 minute par twit kar bataa diya ki bhartiya sena andar tak aa gai he bas hamane use bhaga diya
 Detail is on the way
 phir 7 bajkar 06 minute par twit aata he ki muzaffarabad sector main bhartiya jahaaz ghus aae
 When the Pakistani Air Force retaliated in time, bombs dropped near Balakot in a hurry to escape
 koi mara nahin, koi kshati nahin
 His third tweet came at 9: 59 minutes that 'indian Kashmir has infiltrated the Muzaffarabad sector within 3-4 miles of Azad Kashmir
 jawaab dene par lautne ke liye majaboor jahaazon ne khule main bam gira diya
 No structure has been damaged, technical details and other important information are forthcoming
 'iske baad major general sahab kii taraf se na koi twit aayaa or na detail
 Now 11 after this
 30 minute par bhartiya videsh mantralay kii press conference hoti he
 Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale says that the whereabouts of the terrorist organization Jaish have been targeted
 bharat ke paas pukhta jaankaree thi ki jaish bharat main or fidaayin hamale kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha
 Un-military action was taken to neutralize him earlier
 kisi naagarik kii jaan nahin gai
 No questions were asked or asked in this press conference
 bhartiya vaayu sena kaa naam nahin liya gaya
 Nor was it clear about the location
 yah bhi nahin kaha gaya ki pakistan ke bheetar jahaaz gaye yaa paak adhikrut kashmir main gaye
 India limited the official statement but Pakistan had confirmed where the ships of India went
 baad main sutron ke hawaale se bataaya gaya ki aaparishan kahaan hua tha
 Omar Abdullah first raised questions about Balakot and said that if it happened in Kashmir Pakhtunkhwa then there is a huge strike
 agar nahin to sankethik he
 Later he retweeted and said that the action took place in Kashmir Pakhtunkhwa which is a very big thing
 yuddh yaa do deshon ke bich tanaav ke samay media kii apni chunautiyaan hoti hai
 The scope of confirming or questioning off-record and on-record information becomes very limited
 jo bhi sorce hota he wo aamtaur par ek hi hota he
 Several channels started circulating that terrorist Masood Azhar's brother-in-law had been killed
 bhai sasuraal gaye hai to jo maaraa jayega wo saalaa hi hoga! par yah bayaan kiskaa tha, pataa nahin
 Sometimes there are sources in the Ministry of Defense or Ministry of External Affairs, but the classification of sources is not clear
 of ricard soochnaaon main bhi vishwasaneeyata hoti he magar jab media ke kawarez main bahut antar aane lage to mushkil ho jaati he
 For example, the number of people killed has also been stated differently
 pakistan kahata rahaa ki koi nahin mara he
 The Indian Air Force remained silent doing its magnificent work
 koi twit nahin kiya
 The final information about how this attack was carried out has not been revealed
 abhi aati ja rahi he
 The Mirage 2000 fighter jets are amazing
 koi karonch tak nahin ai to sochaa ja saktaa he ki kis umdaa str kii ranneeti bani hogi
 It is a big thing to carry out such an operation without any lapse
 janata vaayu sena ke parakram se gauravanvit ho uthi
 Congratulations took place media main ek doosraa hi morcha khul gaya
 Plenty of unconfirmed information
 bahasein or naare raajnneetik ho chale
 On the occasion of the might of the government and the Air Force, i will also talk about the downfall of the journalism of the channels (also of newspapers and websites)
 aaj sarkaar kii shabdaawalee zyaada sanyamit or rachanaatmak thi
 But the language of the channels and their screens have changed into video games
 tivi news ke is patan ko aap gaurav ke inhen kshanon main samajhen
 i have done this thing before and will do it today only
 alag alag channel hai magar sabaki public ab ek he
 The rest have been excluded from public channels
 ankaron ke tevar se lag rahaa he ki vahi jahaaz lekar gaye the
 Only then, in our country, in the time of war, there are no ideal standards of journalism
 na hamaare saamne or na unke saamne
 The extent to which we keep information in front is a big challenge
 ham sabake bheetar swaabhaavik deshprem hota he
 From the screens of the channels, it seems that the patriotism is being politicized
 apane deshprem par zyada bharosa rakhen
 If the channels which are creating patriotism within you start showing ghost haunts tomorrow then what will you do
 yah fark usee aitihaasik kshanon main ujagar hona chahie taaki darj ho ki media is itihaas ko kaise prahasan main badal rahaa he
 You have to see what he is doing by giving it theatrical form
 aapako sena, sarkaar kii kamayabi, media kii harkaton or soochnaaon kii pavitrataaon main fark karnaa hi hoga
 On the other hand, there was more creativity in the activities of the Prime Minister than the media
 lagata he aaj unhone bhi news channel nahin dekhe
 May not need to see

 tabhi kahata hum ki aaj channelon ne rachanaatmakataa ke kai avasar ganvaa die
 Today Gandhi got peace or the Geeta duality was resolved, but the work of the sources was done
 ve na hote to channel paanch minute se zyada kaa kaarykram na bana pate
 Pakistan is surrounded
 wo manovaigyanik, ranneetik or kootnithik haar ke kagaar par he
 Will shock kya karegaa dekha jayega
 But he is not accepting the claims of the Indian side
 uski karrwai kii ashanka ko dekhte hue bharat kii simaaen chaukas kar di gai hai
 There will be war, no one knows

 But soon after coming to government, the party has forgotten all its promises

 com / 7hguznz2t7 punjab menkisanonkoparalijalane se rokane ke liye sarkaar bhale hi sakhti karne kaa daawa kare, lekin hakeekat ye he ki kisaan unionon ke khuleam paraali jalaane ke elaan ke baad sarkari afasar asamanjas main he
 Officers do not understand how they should go to the villages and tough on the farmers, because the farmers have given an ultimatum that they will take government officials hostage to take action
 vahiin, punjab pradooshan control board kii koshish he ki paraali jalaane se rokane ke liye saal 1981 ke da air privension and control act ko sakhti se lagu kiya jaae
 The government also organized a seminar of farmer leaders and agricultural experts in Chandigarh, but did not see any result
 pichley teen varshon main darj hue kai kedgar pichley 3 saal ke aankadon par najar daali jaae, to saal 2016 main punjabpradooshacontrol board ne paraali jalaane par 2,414 cese darj kiye the or kareeb 6 lakh 65 hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya tha
 At the same time, in the year 2017, 11,005 cases were registered and a fine of Rs 61 lakh 47 thousand was imposed
 2018 main ab tak 363 cese darj kiye ja chuke hai or 3 lakh 62 hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya ja chukaa he
 The action could not take place due to pressure from farmer unions
 The Air Prevention and Control Act, enacted in 1981, has a provision to impose a fine of ₹ 500 to ₹ 15000
 haalanki kisaan unionon ke dabaav ke chalate punjab polution control board bhi sakht karrwai nahin kar paata he
 In Sangrur, the way farmers lit stubble in many fields citing their helplessness in front of Aaj Tak's camera, it does not seem that it is easy to stop it
 haalanki is ghatana ke baad sangrur ke DC ghanashyam puri ne daawa jarur kiya ki har gaanv memparali jalaaneki ghatnaon ko dhyaan main rakhane ke liye or karrwai karne ke liye nodel officer lagaae gaye hai, lekin hakeekat ye he ki jahaan-jahaan kisaan unionon ke saikadon kaaryakarta or kisaan ikatthe hokar paraali ko aag ke hawaale karte hai, vahaan par koi bhi sarkari adhikari jane kii himmat nahin juta paata
 According to DC Ghanshyam Puri of Sangrur, the attempt to convince the farmers is continuing, and the efforts are being made to explain the farmers and farmers are also being told about the benefits of the straw removal machines
 unhen samajhaayaa ja rahaa he ki paraali jalaane se nuksaan zyada or phaayde bilkul nahin hai
 The Punjab government is also on the back foot due to the stubborn attitude of farmers and the compulsion of farmers to burn stubble
 punjab sarkaar ne khud paraali na jalaane ke liye kisaanon se apil kii he
 Perhaps the government is also aware that even by doing strict, farmers are not going to accept
 isi vajah se rajya sarkaar ne kisaanon ko paraali jalaane se hone vaale pradooshan or punjab kii bigadati chhavi kaa hawala diya he
 The Punjab government held a seminar of farmer unions, intellectuals and farmers experts, besides appealing to farmers not to burn stubble
 kisaanon kii bhi he apni samasyaenaisa nahin he ki aisa seminar pehali baar hua he yakisanonko isaki jaankaree nahin hai
 The question here is the saving of money and time of farmers, to which no one has an answer
 kisaanon kii majaburi ye he ki agali fasal kii taiyaari ke liye samay kam hota he, to duusari taraf paraali ko ikattha karne main kharchaa bhi aata he or ikattha karke iskaa kya kiya jaae, ye bhi kisaanon ke liye samasya he
 However, experts related to agriculture believe that when the government gives 40 thousand crores for the purchase of paddy, why not just increase the subsidy of Rs 2000 crores and give 200 rupees per acre subsidy to the farmer
 saath hi is par vishesh dhyaan diya jaae ki ye dhanrashi un kisaanon ko hi mili, jo paraali nahin jalaate hai
 Delhi Police has arrested two vicious miscreants, who have several criminal cases including murder, robbery and snatching

 sonam ke anand karaj kii tasviren saamne aa gai hai
