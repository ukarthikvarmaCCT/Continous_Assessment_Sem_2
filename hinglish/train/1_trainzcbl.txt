 grih mantralay ne saaf kiya he ki pathankot hamale main hamalaavaron kii taadaad ko lekar wo apane bayaan par kaayam he
 The ministry had said that 4 jaish-e-mohammed terrorists were involved in this attack
 grih mantralay ne loksabhaa ko bataaya ki chah nahin chaar aatankwaadi the jo hamale main maare gaye
 The government has made different statements several times in the past on the number of terrorists in Pathankot attack on January 2
 haalanki rashtriya jaanch agency(nia) ke anusaar pakistan se bharat main sirf chaar aatanki daakhil hue the
 In this regard, Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir said in the Lok Sabha that four terrorists were involved in the attack on the Pathankot airbase
 unhone bataaya ki chaar pakistani aatankwaadi punjab kii janiyal sadak se aae
 They entered India with a dhush bend near the bridge near the river Ravi and attacked Pathankot Air Base
 jinhen hamale ke dauraan maar giraaya gaya, inke paas se hathiyaar bhi baraamad kiye gaye
 But this answer is different from the statement of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh
 isi saal chaar march ko rajnath singh ne kaha tha ki chaar aatankiyon ke shavon ke alaava kuch jaale hue ansh mili hai jinhen forencik jaanch ke liye bheja gaya he
 This statement was given by the Home Minister after the statement of the NSG Chief

 Ram in the mouth, next to it
 pakistan kii yahi niti he
 First defend the terrorists who bleed Bekusars in India, then shed the crocodile tears so that the foreign policies of India and Pakistan do not succeed in leaving a terrorist impression
 pakistan ke raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ko ab yahi dar sata rahaa he
 Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari fears that the foreign policies of India and Pakistan may not change due to the terrorist attack
 donon mulkon ke bich aman kii videshi niti kadavaahat kii videsh niti main naa tabdeel ho jaae
 They fear that terrorists are succeeding in dissolving bitterness between India and Pakistan
 jaradaari sahab rishton main kadavaahat aane kaa dukh to bharat ko bhi he lekin aapako ye kyon najar nahin aata ki aatankwaadi jis zamin par bharat main bekasooron kaa khun bahaane kii yojana banaate hai wo aapaki he
 The Pakistan boss does not have to understand this
 ye to pakistan ke ghadiyaali aansu hai
 If Pakistan really had the pain of relations, the pain of bleeding the beacons in Mumbai, then Pakistan would have supported the truth in the investigation of Mumbai attack, not Fareb
 baharhaal ghadiyaali aansu bahaane main pakistan ke videshmantri bhi peeche nahin hai
 Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has also given a recent statement that India and Pakistan will have to live like good neighbors
 vakt aa gaya he jab dwipaksheeya baatcheet phir se shuru kii jaani chahie
 Qureshi Sahab also has a limit for insolence
 rishton main sudhaar kii chintaa karne se pehle ye to tay kar lete ki mumbai main bekasooron kaa berahami se khun bahaane vaale gunahagaaron ko kiye kii sajaa mil sake
 Minutes after jaish-e-mohammed's mastermind Masood Azhar was detained, there were reports in the Pakistani media that Pakistan was busy fulfilling the promises made to India in the investigation of the Pathankot attack case
 paak media kaa kahana he ki bharat-paak ke bich prastaavit vaarta se do din pehle masood ko hiraasat main liya gaya he

 Where did a Boeing plane fly in the air? 12 din baad bhi kisi ko us vimaan kii hawa tak dhang se nahin mil paa rahi
 The satellite has seen some pictures and has expressed apprehension that it may be the same aircraft that people from all over the world are eyeing in search of
 239 musafiron vaala wo vimaan aakhir kaise achaanak gaayab ho gaya, ye baat ab paheli ban chuki he
 So there are 13 such puzzles, in which one of the puzzles, the truth is hidden
 jise puri duniya jaananaa chaahati he
 What is the secret to missing flight number MH 370
 duniya bhar ke logon ke liye ye ek aisi paheli he jo philhal sulajhati nahin dikhaai de rahi
 26 countries in search of a Malaysian Boeing aircraft since 12 days have found some such puzzles, the truth of which may be very close to the truth of the mysterious disappearance of the aircraft
 yani kisi ek paheli main vimaan se judaa wo sach chupa hua he jise jaanane ke liye puri duniya betaab he
 One flying aircraft hides under the cover of another flying plane
 kya aisa mumkin he
 Yes, it is possible
 aviation main aisa ho saktaa he
 But this is also the puzzle which has entangled those who are doing day and night to solve the puzzle of the disappearance of flight number MH 370
 takanic kii bhashaa main ise single blip kaha jaataa he
 The apprehension is that Boeing aircraft from Malaysia were taken away from the eyes of the whole world in a similar manner and taken to a secret place
 isamen hota ye he ki hawa main udata vimaan usee aakaar or disha main udate hue duusare vimaan kii aad main aa jaataa he or us surat main jameen par lage radar yaa satellite donon vimaanon main antar nahin kar pate
 The result is that an aircraft does not appear in the radar in that way until the two planes separate
 udate hue vimaan ko is tarah duusare vimaan kii aad main chupaane ke liye bade hunar or tajurbe kii jarurat hoti he
 Is the flight number MH 370 in possession of the US Navy? The revelation is shocking
 roosi export ne jab ise jamaane ke saamne rakhaa to puri duniya hairaan rah gai
 Because the United States is among the countries to find the missing plane
 rusi export kii ashanka thi ki kualalampur se beijing ke raste par nikle bowing vimaan ne jaise hi rasta badla to prashanth mahaasaagar main tainaat america nau sena ke radar ne use pakad liya
 Despite the warnings, when the aircraft did not return to its intended path, the US Navy aircraft captured it
 inke alaava ek aisi bhi paheli he jis par log sabase zyada yakeen karte dikhaai de rahe hai
 Is the plane in the grip of an alien? 8 march ko laapata hue malaysian vimaan ko lekar soshal cites par bahes joro par he
 With the rationale that flying in the sky is the reason for the disappearance of Malaysian aircraft
 is tark ko isliye bhi tavajjo mil rahi he kyonki 11 din kii talash main bowing vimaan kaa na to koi malba mila or na hi vimaan ke haadase kaa shikaar hone kaa koi or saboot
 Has the pilot committed suicide? This person has been eyeing the world ever since the plane went missing
 ashanka isliye kyonki 53 saal kaa captain zahaari ahamed shah 8 march kii flite MH 370 kaa mukhya payalat tha or zahaari ahamed jis siyaasi party kaa samarthak tha
 Anwar Ibrahim was sentenced to 5 years in prison on March 7 in Sudomi's case
 jaanch agenciyon ke mutabik jahaari ahamed us din court main bhi maujuud tha
 Zahari was deeply saddened by this decision of the court
 mana ja rahaa he ki apane netaa kii sazaa se dukhi hokar zahaari ne hi vimaan kaa sampark radar se khatm kiya or phir khudakushi kar lee
 If someone can solve this strange mystery of strange, then the same 13 puzzles which have been revealed so far and it is believed that one of them was flying under the cover of one puzzle suddenly disappeared from the middle air
 baat abhi yaheen nahin khatm ho jaati
 Because flight number MH 370 is said to be anecdotal stories about the circumstances under which it went missing
 shaq kabhi kisi aatankwaadi sanghathan par jaataa he to kabhi payalat ko lekar sawaal uthne lagate hai
 In the search of that plane, about 70 lakh 68 thousand square kilometers from Malaysia to South Australia are being explored
 lekin laapata vimaan kii paheli sulajhane ke bajaaye or ulajhati ja rahi he
 a search of 70 lakh 68 thousand square kilometers is being searched for flight number MH 370
 saath hi un paheliyaan ko bhi samajhane kii koshish kii koshish ho rahi he
 
 
 Which has succeeded in removing the biggest air suspension ever encountered around the world
 adhik oonchai se jahaaj main takneekee kharabi anoudate vakt bowing vimaan jameen se kareeb 40 hajaar foot kii oonchai par hote hai
 If the passenger is not wearing an oxygen mask at a higher altitude, he may become unconscious within seconds
 ashanka yahi he ki kuch der usee oonchai par rahane ke baad jaise hi payalat vimaan ko saamaanya oonchai par laayaa ho kisi takneekee kharabi se atisi ke radar kaa vimaan se sampark tut gaya ho or vimaan laapata ho gaya
 Was the plane a victim of piracy? Flight number MH 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12
41 am
 or thik 49 minute baad vimaan kaa transponder of ho gaya
 ATC controls the aircraft and its route from the ground through the same transponder
 jis kisi ne bhi vimaan kaa transponder band kiya wo jaanata tha ki transponder ke band hote hi vimaan radar kii najaron se ojhal ho jayega
 In aviation radio technology, it is also called piracy
 vimaan ko gupt jagah par utaara gaya?kualalampur ke international hawaii adde se udaan bharne ke kuch der baad hi vimaan kaa atisi se sampark tut gaya tha
 Even then, the aircraft had about seven hours worth of fuel to fly
 ashanka he ki clalalampur se dakshin pashchim kii taraf jis jagah vimaan satellite ke saath aakhir baar sampark main tha
 There are many such islands in the sea
 jahaan aabaadi bhi nahin he or dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke samay kii vahaan gupt hawaii pattiyaan hai or bowing 777 ke pahiye kamjor ranve par bhi aasaani se utaarne laayak bhi hai
 It is possible that the aircraft has been evacuated from the radar's sight and taken to such a secret place
 aapraadhik sajeesh kaa shikaar?kualalampur international airport se udaan bharne ke ghante bhar baad hi vimaan kaa sampark atisi se tut gaya tha
 Investigators have said many times that the plane's contact was not broken, but was broken
 to kya vimaan kisi aapraadhik sajeesh kaa shikaar hua
 Was there anyone among the passengers of the plane who captured the plane and took it to a secret place
 vimaan kaa apharan?ye bhi ashanka he
 But after so many days, there is no sign that the plane was hijacked
 vajah saaf he
 What do the people who hijack a plane want? unki maangen kya kya hai
 
 kyon abhi tak apaherta duniya ke saamne nahin aae?vimaan main bam dhamaakaashanka ye bhi he ki vimaan kisi bam dhamaake kaa shikaar hua he
 But this thing is not embracing because not a single piece of aircraft debris was seen in such a large area
 saaf he
 If such an accident had happened, it would have definitely come in the eyes of someone
 vimaan main koi sandigdh musafir bhi tha?laapata vimaan kii talash main lage jaanch kartaaon ko ek malaysian naagarik par bhi shaq he
 The name is Mohammad Khairul Amiri Salamat
 29 saal kaa ye musafir aviation ejeeniyar he or china main kisi vimaan company main tainaat tha
 
 shaq yahi he ki salaamat vimaan ko radar kii najaron se bachaane kaa hunar jaanata he
 The Taliban's hand in the disappearance of the aircraft? Countries in search of the aircraft are not ignoring the possibility that no Taliban organization should be involved in the disappearance of the aircraft
 or kahin is vimaan ko gupt tareeke se aatankwaadiyon ne radar kii nazaron se bachaakar afghanistan ke thikaane tak na pahunchaa diya ho
 Conspiracy of terror? After the disappearance of Malaysian aircraft, this fear was first frightened by the world that no major terrorist conspiracy was being carried out like 9 / 11
 lekin guzarate vakt ke saath ye theory kamjor padane lagi
 Those who read satellite photos have told the world the latest truth
 wo vaaki khaufnak he
 The hint is that in the Indian Ocean
 
 Thousands of kilometers away from Australia on deep sea waves
 ek jagah toote hue vimaan ke kuch tukade nazar aae hai
 Many questions also came up with this revelation
 or sabase bada sawaal yahi ki kya wo vimaan itani dur pahunch bhi saktaa tha
 And if not, whose debris is it? Is the missing plane's address found? Is flight number MH 370 really a victim of an accident? Is that unknown piece found in the sea of the same Boeing that went missing 12 days ago? If this news is true
 
 
 agar satellite ko wo tasviren jhooth nahin bol rahi
 
 agar vimaan kii talash main lagi duniya bhar kii tiimon kii tamaam ashankaayen sahi hai
 
 
 And if the piece that flows on the deep sea waves of the Indian Ocean is of the same plane that disappeared 12 days ago, then the more painful truth has hardly been revealed to the world in recent times
 satellite se mili tasveeron ko padhane waalon ne to isi khaufnak sach kii taraf ishaara kiya he
 That is, the missing plane of Malaysia fell into the sea after falling victim to an accident and all the passengers on the plane were killed
 pichley 12 dinon se us laapata vimaan kii talash main duniya bhar ke 26 mulkon ke 18 ship, 19 aircraft or 6 helicopter lage hue the
 But as soon as the picture of a satellite was revealed on Thursday, the call shouted across Malaysia
 kyonki is akeli khabar ke saath hi unki tamaam ummiden bhi gahare samandar main samaa gayi thim
 It is being told that the satellite's camera has seen a piece of water flowing in the Indian Ocean, which is feeling the broken part of an aircraft
 jis jagah wo tukdaa nazar aayaa wo jagah dakshin australia ke perth shahar se dakshin main kareeb 1460 mile dur yani 2260 kilometre dur bataai ja rahi he
 And if the truth of the satellite photos is true, then there are scattered pieces of aircraft in a radius of 24 miles at that place
 malaysia ke raksha mantri kii maane to unke liye har wo khabar jaruri he jiskaa taalluk flite sankhya MH 370 he
 Maybe the picture from the satellite is telling the truth
 ho saktaa he ki tasveeron kaa padhane waalon kaa anumaan sahi ho
 But there are still some questions
 jinke jawaab kii jarurat har kisi ko mahasoos ho rahi he
 At least after the plane's debris was found
 masalan - jis jagah vimaan kaa malwa mila vahaan tak aakhir wo vimaan pahunchaa kaise
 While he lost contact with ATC? Is the pilot immersed in the ocean? Did the plane fall into the sea after the fuel ran out? Was there so much fuel left in the aircraft after it lost contact with ATC that it could cover such a distance? Or is that debris from someone else? Can't solve the missing plane puzzle without answering these questions? upi main samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar banane ke baad 20 maheenon ke dauraan 100 se adhik chote-bade sampradayik dange or agast-sitambar main mujffarnagar or aasapaas ke ilaakon main hue dange ne mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kii lokapriyata main jabardast giravat kii thi

 On Wednesday, the entire opposition appeared united on the issue of demonetisation, with around 200 opposition mps demonstrating near the Gandhi statue in the Parliament complex
 vipaksh ne sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar ke faisle se aam janata pareshaan he
 People are not getting money from banks and atms
 vipaksh ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ko sadan ke andar vipaksh kii baat ko sunanaa chahie or apni baat bhi sadan main rakhni chahie, lekin piem sadan main aane kii bajaay apni baat baahar hi rakhte he
 The entire opposition formed a human chain with slogans near the Gandhi complex, as well as the uproar of opposition mps in both houses continued
 vipaksh ne wel main aakar hangaamaa karte hue notebandi ke khilaaf narebaaji kii
 Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia said that as long as the common man continues to have trouble, we will continue to raise our voice
 gandhi murti ke paas pradarshan main rahul gandhi samet vipaksh ke bade netaa shaamil hue, pradarshan main mayawati, mulaayam singh or mamata banerjee shaamil nahin hue haalanki inaki partiyon ke saansad vahaan maujuud rahe
 The government's reply, 'janata hai saath', in the same answer, the government has said that we are ready to discuss the issue of demonetisation, while the public is with the government on this issue, what are the people who are making trouble
 vitt rajyamantri arjuna meghavaal kaa kahana he ki notebandi ko lekar aam janata sarkaar ke saath he, vipaksh ko sadan main charchaa kerani chahie
 Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said that the outcome of the by-election has revealed who the public is with
 kya aap yakeen karenge ki aaj ke is daur main bhi bail or second hand scooter se sasti keemat betiyon kii he? kya aap yakeen karenge ki aaj ke is daur main bhi bade-bade shaharon or mahanagaron main betiyaan kharidi or bechi ja rahi hai? baqayada dukaanon main insaanon kii mandi lag rahi he? yakeen nahin aata naa? par vaardaat main jo kuch aap dekhenge uske baad aapako yakeen karnaa hi hoga
 The price of a pair of bulls is 30 thousand rupees
 The cost of a 'doll' on the cost of an old scooter is 15 thousand rupees
 Yes, daughters of the country are selling
 desh kii ‘gudiya’ bik rahi he
 The country's dearly is being sold
 naa sirf bik rahi he balki behisaab bik rahi he
 It is selling in the streets, in shops, in villages and cities
 ye wo khulata hua sach he jo aaj aapako jhakzor kar rakh degaa
 Your eyes will be torn apart when you see the 21st century market where humans are still bought and sold like slaves and animals
 aapako apni ankhon dekhi par bhi yakeen nahin aayega ki kaise bade-bade shaharon main, mahanagaron main betiyaan bik rahi hai
 And those buying are buying
 kabhi naukari ke naam par, to kabhi shaadi ke naam par, kabhi videsh bhejne ke naam par to kabhi gharon main kaam karne vaali ke naam par ladakiyon kii kharid-farokht jari he
 Girls are being brought to cities like sheep and goats from small towns and villages
 unki garibi kii boli lagaai ja rahi he or phir unhen mandi main utaar diya ja rahaa he
 Leave the rest alone, if we talk about the government figures, then only last year about 4 thousand girls were bought and sold in the country
 jabaki gaiyr-sarkari aankade isse kareeb sau guna zyada hai
 The most dangerous picture is of the country's capital Delhi
 jahaan placement agenciyon kii aad main maanav taskari ke dhandhe par kaanoon kaa mulammaa chadha kar dhandhebaaj lagaataar sabaki ankhon main dhul jhonk rahe hai
 The true travesty of the dark streets of human trafficking is
 darasal aaj tak kii team ko pataa chalaa ki betiyon kii kharid-faokht kii sabase badi mandi aajkal dilli main lagi hui he
 Different shops have opened with different names
 or un dukaanon main baqayada insaanon kii kharid farokht hoti he
 So when Aaj Tak tried to look into such shops, we were shocked to see the reality of this market going on openly
 insaanon kii mandi yani human trephiking kii duniya apane-aap main ek bada tilism samete he
 To find out what is the reality of human trafficking in the biggest hideout of human trafficking, till date, one by one visited several bases of human trafficking in Delhi and what was shown in this effort was really surprising
 insaanon ke in dukaanon main gharelu kaam-kaaj se lekar jismfaroshi tak ke liye ladkiyaan bik rahi thim
 a residential area on the northwest corner of Shakurbastidilli
 akele isi ilaake main placement angesi ke naam se human trephiking kii takreeban 180 se zyada dukaane chal rahi hai, jo saalon se tamaam kaayade kanoonon ko thenga dikhaakar insaanon kii kharid-farokht main jute hai
 To know the reality of these agencies, one such placement agency reached till today through the narrow streets of Shakurbasti
 ke
 To the office of the enterprises
 jahaan manoj naam kaa ek aisa dalal he, jo saalon se ye dhandha kar rahaa tha
 Aaj Tak started a conversation with him by hiring Made Servant and kept moving forward
 hamane usase poocha
 
 
 Question - How much will the commission be? Answer - Total 35 thousand
 20 hajaar agent kaa or 15 hajaar to hamaara bhi banataa he
 Question - What kind of demand do people have? Answer - Hey Sir, some people demand something completely different
 sawaal - kya karte hai bataaie to sahi
 
 
 Answer - Once an SHO from Delhi came and started saying that such a maid who takes full care, full care means do everything
 
 
 sawaal - to aisi naukaraaniyaan bhi hoti hai kya?jawaab - bilkul hoti hai, aap paise kharch kariye, maheene ke kareeb 30 se 40 hajaar lagenge lekin wel menten hogi, aap baahar bhi le ja sakate ho apane saath, english bhi bolti hogi
 Question - Where will these girls come from? Answer - will bring them from Darjeeling, such girls will also be found in Shillong
 aap chintaa mat karo aapako paise khalegaa nahin
 
 sawaal - kabatak mil jaaegi hamako aisi ladki?jawaab - aap 5 se 7 din kaa time do main arange kar duungaa
 In lieu of mouth-watering price, this broker also started talking about giving us such a girl who is ready to be made serviced as well as for prostitution
 lage haath apana rob ganthne ke liye manoj naam ke is shaks ne yahaan tak bataa diya ki ladakiyon kii is tarah kii kharid-farokht main khud dilli police ke afasar bhi shaamil hai
 We saw the reality of a placements agency
 lihaaja, ham vahaan se nikle or ek duusari agency main ja pahunche
 An unnamed agency
 is agency main ek mahila baithi thi, jo hame dekhte hi baatcheet ke liye taiyaar ho gai
 Here also we talked about Made Servant
 or usne jo kuch bataaya, usase saaf ho gaya ki kis tarah desh ke gramin ilaakon se kis tarah bholi-bhali ladakiyon ko fansaa kar unhen shaharon main bech diya jaataa he
 Question - You go to fetch girls
 
 
 jawaab - haa, main hi jaati hum
 i bring girls from Jharkhand
 sawaal - ek baar main kitni ladkiyaan le aati ho
 Answer - 4 to 5 girls go if they go
 sawaal - dar nahin lagata aapako?jawaab - nahin dar nahin lagata he, sabko raste main khate-pilaate le aati hum
 This agent agreed to sell us even a minor, ie only 11 year old girl
 sawaal - hamaare dost ke ghar main kaam ke liye choti ladki kii jarurat he
 Answer - Yes, i will give it
 aap bataa dena ki kahaan rahegi
 i will send the girl, there is no problem
 jaahir he, bina kisi parde ke placement agency ke naam par chal rahi ye dukaane ye sabit karne ko kaaphi hai ki kis tarah police kii jaankaree main dilli main human trephiking kaa kaarobaar dhadlle se jari he
 Poverty forced her to move out of her home to work
 par naukari ke naam par wo ek baar nahin aath-aath baar biki
 For the first time it cost only two thousand rupees
 lekin phir aisa bikna shuru hui ki keemat do hajaar rupee se badhkar 30 hajaar rupee tak pahunch gai
 After selling with tens of hands and being a victim of rape, this 'doll' is not able to understand where it will go? Name - Sarita Tanti: 18 years old - Udalguri, disproportionate - only 30 It sounds strange to hear a thousand rupees, but in the world of human trafficking, human trafficking, this girl is worth a lot at this time
 jis daur main insaan chand or mangal kii dooriyaan naap rahaa ho, large hydrone colider jaise prayog ho rahe hon, us daur main agar desh kii rajdhani dilli main kisi ladki ko chand rupayon main kisi bejaan cheez yaa phir bhed-bakrii kii tarah kharid-bechaa jaae, to phir ise aap kya kahenge? assam ke ek behad pichde ilaake se aanevaali is ladki kii kahani kuch aisi hi he
 Eight years ago, when this girl was first bid, it cost only 2 thousand rupees
 lekin tab se lekar ab tak isaki keemat main puure 15 guna kaa ijapha ho chukaa he
 That is, its value has increased from Rs 2 thousand to now Rs 30 thousand
 lekin sitam dekhie apane ab tak ke tamaam umr main ye ladki utane rupee bhi nahin kama saki he, jitne main is vaqt isaki boli lag rahi he
 This is true of the world of human trafficking
 sarita taanti- ‘mujhe kai baar bechaa gaya, dhokhaa diya gaya
 
 
 In the name of getting Sarita a good job in Delhi, a boy from her village brought her to Delhi when she was only 10 years old
 2 bhaaiyon or 7 bahanon main ek sarita kaa parivaar behad garib tha or sarita us nadaan umr apane parivaar kii takadir badalane ke iraade se ghar se nikali thi
 After this, her family's fate did not change, but Sarita's fate certainly changed
 punjabi baag kii ek placement agency anuraag interprijes ke jariye sarita in aath saalon main puure aath baar bechi gai or alag-alag gharon main naukaraani kaa kaam karti rahi
 But not even once did he get his salary
 is dauraan kabhi kisi ne sarita ko saalon-saal dadbe main band rakhaa, to kisi ne kai-kai dinon tak bhookha rakhaa
 Once, while working in Khanna in Punjab, he was burnt to his hand by accusing him of theft
 lekin sarita kii zindagi kaa asli dard abhi baaki tha
 After this excess, Sarita once again escaped and reached the same placements agency, a boy named Baleshwar started raping her here
 iske baad to sarita ke saath julmo-sitam kii sari hadein khatm ho gai or baleshwar ne uskaa garbhpaat tak karavaaya
 When Sarita finally complained in this regard to Saraswati Vihar police station in Delhi, instead of taking action against Baleshwar, the police settled the two
 ab baleshwar kaa hausala badha or usne jabardastee sarita kii maang main sindur bhar diya
 Sarita Tanti - 'raped me many times, abortion was done
 
 
 ’lekin jab sarita ne baleshwar ko duusari ladakiyon ke saath bhi thik aisa hi karte dekha, to phir wo baleshwar ke changul se bhaag nikali
 Now the condition is that she wants to punish Baleshwar and his friends
 lekin aisa kaise mumkin hoga, ye philhal koi nahin jaanata
 This is the capital Delhi's reality: If Delhi has a big place in the world, then being the biggest destination of human trafficking, this city is also not infamous
 lekhin aakhir wo kya baat he, jo dilli ko maanav taskari kaa sabase bada garh banaati he
 From getting a job at home to a wedding ceremony and then to Jismfaroshi, you will be shocked when you know the reality of Delhi
 kehane to dilli wo shahar he, jahaan se desh chalata he
 This is the place where all the laws are made and this is the place from where they apply in the whole country
 magar, afsos human trephiking ke maamle main saare kanoon shaayad yaheen aakar dam tod dete hai
 Because if it does not, then today Delhi is not infamous as the largest base of human trafficking in the country
 ek aisa adda, jo sorce bhi he, transit root bhi or destination bhi
 That is, this is the place where the buying and selling of human beings also starts, they are also brought here to sell from other cities and they are sold here at the bases of jismaphoris or at different places
 garibi or bhukhmaree ke chalate har saal desh ke pichde rajyon se hajaaron log dilli samet desh ke tamaam bade shaharon kii taraf bhaage aate hai
 And people associated with the business of human trafficking have been taking advantage of this helplessness of the poor for years
 sabase pehle aise logon khaaskar garib ladakiyon ko gharon yaa factriyon main kaam dilaane ke bahaane bahalaaya phuslaaya jaataa he or phir trainon se sidhe dilli pahunchaa diya jaataa he
 From states like West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam and Odisha, the first human trafficking girls are brought to Delhi on trains and then either sold to Delhi or Haryana, Punjab, with the help of Placement Agency Delivers to different cities of Gujarat and Rajasthan
 khaas baat ye he ki is dauraan ek taraf to ladakiyon se kiye gaye vaayade puure nahin hote, duusari taraf unhen yon shoshan kaa shikaar bhi bana diya jaataa he
 But this reality is not only in Delhi, but apart from Delhi, the human trafficking business is bad in all other cities of the country
 neshnal krime record beuro ke aankadon ke mutabik ye dhandha saal dar saal lagaataar bad rahaa he
 According to these figures, while there were nearly 3000 cases of human trafficking in the year 2009, 3422 cases were recorded a year later in 2010
 iske baad agle saal yani 2011 main ye aankada 3517 tak pahunch gaya or maanav taskari kaa shikaar honevaale in logon main zyada ladkiyaan thi, jinhen yaa to jismfaroshi ke addon tak pahunchaa diya gaya yaa phir khadi deshon main bech diya gaya
 Now when the business of human trafficking is on such a large scale and in an unrestrained style, there is bound to be doubt on the statutes of the law
 lekin jaankaron kii maane to placement agency kii aad main khud dilli police chand rupayon ke badale insaani khadid-farokht ke dhandhe par ankhen munde rahati hai
 Moreover, the police of many police stations of West Delhi including Punjabi Bagh, Rajouri Garden, get tied-up money for this

 Team India achieved a major achievement in its name by defeating Australia by 75 runs in the Bangalore Test
 bharat ne australia ko 188 ranon kaa target diya tha
 But Australia piled on 112 runs
 yani 200 se kam ke target kaa bachaav karte hue sabase badi jeet kii baat karen, to test cricket kii yah teesri badi jeet maani jaaegi
 The largest ever win by a West Indies defending a target of less than 200 was in 1994, when it defeated England by 147 runs

 unako janmdin kii dher sari badhai
 Have heard that the government has gone abroad to cut the cake and celebrate the birthday
 thik bhi he, desh main is vakt khushiyon kaa maahaul bhi nahin he
 Uttarakhand has caused havoc due to heavy rains
 hajaaron yatri fanse hai
 And in your place of residence Delhi is also in danger of dreaded floods
 aise main yahaan kek katate, to sab nero or rome kii baaten karte
 Anyway, to handle all this is Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi
 aap nahin hai
 Because preparations are going on now
 satta ke jehar ko jaanane vaala rajkumaar abhi halaat kii reki hi kar rahaa he
 So what happened it took 9 years
 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main utarane ke saath hi aapane saaf kar diya tha ki bhartiya raajnneeti bahut pechida he or shaayad 30 baras baad main is par coment karne laayak ho paaun
 There are 21 years left
 mulk intjaar kar legaa
 It will not lose faith in the Messiah named Gandhi
 to usee aasthaa kaa hawala dekar janata ne ek vicialist taiyaar kii he
 Today is your birthday, you will be very happy
 isi khushi ke maukey par ise padhein, samajhen or bataaen, kya he aapkaa ritern gift, in vishes ke aivaj main
 1
 jimmedaari lenge kab, intjaar bhi intjaar se ub gaya he absanghathan kah rahaa he ki aap aage aaen
 Many Congress leaders, including the Prime Minister, have said that Rahul Gandhi's leadership is needed now
 lekin aap hai ki bataa hi nahin rahe ki aglaa loksabhaa chunaav aapaki sadaarat main ladaa jayega yaa nahin
 Strategists are deployed from your office
 sanghathan main bhi ab puraane kshatrap ritairement vaali post par pahunch gaye hai
 Those who have got the responsibility, they are trusted by you
 magar phir bhi aap parde ke peeche hi rahete hai
 Remember that this country considered Sonia Gandhi's renunciation of pm's post in 2004
 magar yah bhi maan rahaa he ki sonia bina jimmedaari ke satta centre bani hai
 Corruption happens, inflation increases, then the responsibility of the Manmohan government
 kuch bhi loklubhaavna hota he, to shrey sonia ji ko
 If you think that power will continue without responsibility, think again
 kyonki siyasat ke pyaade yani janata, raja kii ye chaal samaj chuke hai
 2
 bharat kii khoj chunaavon ke baad kyon roak dete hanaap gaanvon main gaye
 Sitting on the bike
 pagarhndiyon par chale
 Opponents made a stir but the country paid attention
 aapane kaha bhi baar-baar lagaataar ki log nahin jate, to aap kehete hai ki rajdhani main baithkar siyasat karte hai
 i am going, so you are asking, why are you going? magar aapke jane ke baad ek sawaal baar-baar jehan main aa rahaa he
 That is, you searched the village towns of UP before the 2012 assembly elections
 bharat kii khoj main din-raat lage rahe
 Somewhere spent the night on a cot, sometimes took a bath on a well
 lekin chunaav ke baad ye khoj ruk gai
 Should Des wait for 2014 or the next assembly election to see the sequel of this discovery
 khoj aapaki, laalach janata kaa
 Actually, when you go, mostly in Congress and some places once ruled by other political parties, then the plight of the place would become a part of the headlines
 mukhyadhara main aakar dhanya ho jaati
 So continue the journey so that you continue to know the problems and the problems continue to be known to you

 When there is a need, you do not even see the country had high hopes from your father Rajiv Gandhi
 itnaa bada janadesh unke dada ji nehru ko bhi nahin mila tha
 Rajiv knew this
 unhone party ke mumbai adhiveshan main kaha bhi tha, 'main bhi yuva hum
 i too have some dreams
 ' unamem se kuch sapane puure hue, zyaadaatar adhure rah gaye
 The dream of Panchayati Raj fell asleep due to the plunder of MNREGA
 khayr, aap bhi yuva hai
 Whenever they share their dreams
 magar hakeekat yah he ki jab desh ko is yuva netaa kii aawaaj, uski soch or netritv kii sabase zyada jarurat hoti he, tab aap nadaarad hote hai
 The country including Delhi landed on the roads in December
 gangrape kii ghatana ke baad gussa tha sabake man main
 During this, Shinde appeared
 arpyen singh najar aae
 More party and power warriors were seen
 magar aap, chote supremeo, kahin najar nahin aae
 Right now the northern part of the country is reeling under floods
 dilli bhi khatre main he
 But you are not there again
 sansad main aksar jaruri bahason main bhi nahin hote
 So will you make a glimpse of the statements only during your visit

 How much democracy did youth organization become MP in 2004
 2007 main party ke rashtriya mahasachiv
 Earlier, only one leader had such rapid growth
 aapke pita rajeev gandhi kii
 After the death of uncle Sanjay in the accident at Safdarjung Airport, his father had to enter politics with a heart
 amethi se vah bhi saansad bane the or phir jald hi mahasachiv
 He did not say, but you repeatedly said, 'I have come here because of a special name and system
 phir bhi main ye system badalanaa chahta hum
 i want to bring democracy to the party
 taaki aap kiske bete hai, isse chijen tay na hon
 'this statement gave hope to the country
 aap kai vishvavidhyalayon main gaye
 Along with Meenakshi was Natarajan
 tathyon se las bauddhik, jo ek-ek kar sanghathan kii seedhi chadhin or mandsaur kii saansad hai
 You communicated
 apane yahi tathy or tark dohraye
 Then interviewed Tughlaq Road office
 sanghathan chalaane waalon ke
 It was a matter of preference for the youth
 voter list bani or purv chunaav ayukta lingadoh kii nigaraanee main youth congress or enesayuai ke chunaav hue
 But what is this yahaan to aapke darshan ko thenga diya gaya
 In most states, the sons or relatives of influential leaders or commanders from their camps have taken over
 or aage kii baat karen, to upie kii do do sarkaron main in sanghathanon se aae kitne logon ko satta main puri hissedari di gai
 When youngsters look at the list of ministers, the weight of the surname is also seen here
 par isi ke khilaaf to lard rahe the aap
 5
 jite to rahul ji kii mehnat or haare to sthaneey vajahenek kahawat he
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee's mouth was heard in a meeting in Kanpur
 chit bhi meri, pat bhi meri, anta mere baap kaa
 The party organization does this for you unknowingly
 2009 main loksabhaa chunaav hue
 In UP, the party won 21 seats, blasting estimates
 sabane kaha, haa haa aapke commander digvijay singh ne bhi kaha ki rahul magic he yah
 We accepted, appreciated
 magar phir aae teen baras baad 2012 main vidhansabha ke chunaav
 Everything was the same
 intervyuu, tikat vitaran or aapke daure
 But the seats were able to improve equally in the poor performance of 2007
 party ko mahaj 28 siten milin vidhansabha main
 Then the same commander came forward and said that elections were fought on local issues and it cannot be called Rahul Ji's report card
 bihar main bhi aisa hi rahaa
 Karnataka elections were held now
 aapaki party jiti to phir vahi tark ki rahul ji ke netritv kii jeet he ye
 So the public wants to know why only the victory is won, even some soil of defeat should be applied on the forehead

 Modi is in the contest, what are your thoughts? In the 2007 Gujarat assembly elections were being held
 sonia gandhi vahaan gayi or modi ko maut kaa saudagar kaha
 The clever politician Modi also redeemed it in his favor and if the results came, he was seen as a dealer of votes
 paanch saal baad phir aisa hua, is baar aapane bhi kai jagah manch se muqabla kiya tha unka
 But now the issue has changed
 manch khiskkar dilli main saj gaya he
 The BJP indirectly declared Modi as the PM candidate
 vah kitni aakraamak he, iskaa pramaan jediu se gathbandhan todakar bhi de diya
 Modi is coming to Delhi, going across the country and putting forth his agenda
 magar aap hai ki bataa hi nahin rahe ki modi kii chunauti kaa kis tarah saamana karenge
 Your party has the same weapon to attack Modi, that is communal
 magar unke saath jo vichaar chalata he, jisamen hindutv, vikaas or prachaar ke tatv hai, uske mukaable aap sa kemiyagiri kaa daawa karne vaala koi rasayan kyon nahin laayaa abhi tak
 And when your special Jairam Ramesh accepts Modi as a challenge, then everyone in the party gets into his shameful feud
 aise nakaar se to morcha kamjor hi padataa he na
 7
 activism ke daur main active bas ek baar hueek baar, bas ek baar hi ye hua
 Therefore, say miracles
 satta kaa yuvaraj kisaanon ke saath sadakon par utraa or giraftaar hua
 The place was Bhatta Parsaul village in UP, where farmers were protesting against the low price of land acquired for the high way
 magar iske alaava aap kahin bhi apni yaa virodhiyon kii sarkaar ke saamne janata ke saath khadey najar nahin aae
 When the country was agitated on the issue of Lokpal in the month of August, during the debate in Parliament, you said why not give constitutional status to Lokpal
 prekshkon ne ise mudde kii hawa nikaalane vaala bayaan bataaya
 After that you went to Vidarbha and other backward areas of the country
 jahaan kisaanon, daliton or adivaasiyon kaa haq maaraa ja rahaa he
 You raised slogans in their favor
 magar jab lautakar satta ke mad main chur dilli aae, to sab bhul gaye
 The policies of your party and its leaders, their actions have turned this slogan into a political drama, which cannot be considered a reality
 8
 The poison of power is drunk, drink the nectar of the words
 In 2013, the Congress was once again punished
 jagah thi jaipur
 The chorus anthem of Rahul ji to be made the Prime Minister had by now sounded the voice of Chief Singer Manmohan
 vah bhi jab tak kores main aawaaj laga lete
 But then you said, i am not ready yet
 taiyaari pukhta karne ke liye mahasachiv se pramotion hua or aap rashtriya upaadhyaksh ban gaye
 And then we heard that emotional speech
 kal raat maa mere kamare main ai or roi
 Said power is poison
 desh bhi ro padaa
 Loudly
 use laga ki rahul baba ko aakhir pataa chal hi gaya ki sattadhish koun sa jehar unke gale utaar rahe hai lagaataar
 But after and even before that, you gave us nothing but sentimental claims
 kisi samasya par koi doorgaami vichaar nahin
 We remember just being directed by your PR firm
 ki kab camera kahaan or us dauraan kurte kii kitni baanhen chadhaani hai
 When to feed a small child
 kab dimple vaali muskaan deni he
 When to hide it in his beard
 desh ne dekha ki rajkumaar mitti main utar aae hai
 But he also had to listen to what is the solution for the mutilated person
 9
 The corruption has caused soot, day and night, here too, the biggest criticism of the UPA government is about corruption
 kai mantriyon ko istipha dena padaa or koyala ghotaale kii aanch to piemo tak pahunch gai he
 In all this, there are reports of tussle between power and organization
 kabhi 2 ji ghotaale ke aankade to kabhi koi or, desh lakhon karod ke ank se itnaa abhyast ho gaya he, jaise barason se yahi sab karata aa rahaa ho
 Actually, the number has been doing for years, the power changes and the scam points also change
 lekin in sabake bich desh naaraaz hua
 Began to speak the language of the movement
 jahaan jisane satta kaa istemaal karpshan ke liye kiya, use bedakhal kar diya
 You saw it in Karnataka and it got sweet results
 lekin vahaan se baahar aate hi karpshan mudda nahin rah jaataa
 On this, the rulers do not scold you, they do not get punished
 or ek sach to yah bhi he ki khud aapke jija robert wadra par bhi aarope lage
 The courts will decide what is the truth, but you remain silent on all these issues
 na desh kaa man tatola, na apane man kii baat kahi10
 You are young and usually get married only at a young age
 People do not get into arguments about why you are going to raise the bar of being young every year
 ham khoji patrakaron kii tarah 2004 ke munshiganj main hue intervyuu seshan kaa hawala dekar aapaki venezuela main rahane vaali spanish garlfriend ke bare main bhi sawaal nahin karenge
 The issue is related to your privacy and every Indian respects it
 magar vahi janata yah bhi puuchhati rahati he ki desh kaa handsam, most powerful or isiilie eligible bachaler shaadi kab karegaa
 You already know how important is the institution of family name
 or aaj bhi sabhi parivaar banane-badhaane ke liye shaadi ko jaruri samajhate hai
 But you avoid this every time
 sonia ji ne bhi sanketon main apni chintaa jaahir kii
 But you are used to making the country a country
 are seva jaruri he, magar saathi ho, to sambal miltaa rahata he
 Good Rahul ji, have unnecessarily read such a long letter on your birthday
 samajhnaa chahie ki aap desh kii chintaaon main vyast hai or is chitthibaji ke liye zyada vakt nahin

 com / rwg4j70w51 america raashtrapati baraak obama ne kaha he ki white house ko ummid he ki donald trump raashtrapati ke rup main nirvaachit nahin ho paaenge
 Obama strongly criticized the billionaire entrepreneur associated with real estate for his statements
 unhone mangalvaar ko califrnia main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'meraa lagaataar maananaa he ki trumparashtrapatinhee ban paaenge
 The reason is that i have great faith in the American people
 or meri soch yah he ki ve maanate hai ki raashtrapati pad kaa daayitv ek gambhir kaam he
 "this is not a talk show or a reality show," Obama said on the sidelines of a summit of leaders and delegates from 10 Southeast Asian countries
 yah marketing nahin he
 This is difficult
 ' unhone kaha, 'america log kaaphi samajhadaar hai or meraa maananaa he ki ant main ve samajhadaari bharaa faisla karenge
 According to surveys, the 69-year-old trump is ahead of Republican contenders for presidential candidacy
 karnataka ke purv mukhyamantri moili ne kaha, 'yadi vah istipha dena chaahate bhi hai to yah iskaa samay nahin he
 Until he brings an option to handle the situation, i do not think Rahul Gandhi should step down
 ' congress ke varisht netaa ne kaha ki gandhi ko apana istipha turant 'waapas' lenaa chahie or jimmedaari sanbhaalani chahie, unhen anushaasan lagu karnaa chahie tathaa bina samay ganvaaye party main sudhaar karnaa chahie or usamen 'aatmavishvaas, josh or utsaah' bharna chahie
 He said that Congress should not be disappointed with the poor performance in the Lok Sabha elections
 party bhavishya main vaapasi karegi
 'such enthusiasm should be in every leader of Congress and every worker
 ' moili ne party ke kaaryakartaaon kaa manobal ooncha banaaye rakhane ke liye uchit ranneeti apnaane par jor diya
 He also said that there is a need to increase confidence in local, state and national leadership
 unhone kaha, 'vipaksh ko congress kii haar kaa laabh nahin lene dena chahie
 The reasons for the party's defeat can be ascertained, but it is necessary to keep the party united
 'unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi ko dilli main ek manthan baithak bulani chahie, jisamen na keval congress kaarysmiti or pradesh ikaayiyon ke pramukhon ko hi nahin balki usamen party ke un netaaon ko bhi bulaanaa chahie jo hameshaa sanghathan ke saath khadey hue
 Similar meetings should also be convened at the state level
 unke anusaar vibhinn staron par party cametiyon kaa tatkaal punargathan hona chahie or jo achche parinaam nahin de sake unhen badla janaa chahie
 Moily said, 'they (gandhi) should take stock of things
 aap pad (kanges adhyaksh kaa) khaali nahin rakh sakate
 They should take over their responsibilities, discipline should be implemented, wherever there is a problem, it should be dealt with on a war footing
 ' moili ne kaha, 'yadi vah istipha dena chaahate hai
 
 
 Not at this level, they have to take very drastic steps, those who could not produce good results should be removed at the state level and other places, they cannot leave like this
 unhen khud par jor dena hoga or party ko vyavasthit karnaa hoga
 This is their duty
 ' Targeting Arvind Kejriwal, BJP has said that these leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party want to stay in the headlines by chanting Narendra Modi
 bijepi pravaktaa shahanvaj hossain ne kaha, 'agar kejariwal ko surkhiyon main bane rahanaa he, to unhen namo-namo jaap karnaa hoga
 He is doing modi-modi to stay in the news
 'shahanvaj ne kaha ki dilli se baahar kaa rasta dikhaae ja chuke kejariwal or unki party ko ab na to desh, na hi media gambhirtha se le rahaa he
 Shahnawaz said, "if they (kejriwal) do not speak against Narendra Modi, the media will not give him any consideration
" ve dilli se baahar kaa rasta dikhaae ja chuke hai
 Now neither the country nor the media is taking them seriously
 ve ab apni raajnneeti modi kaa naam japakar chalaa rahe hai
 Kejriwal has indicated in his Bengaluru rally on Sunday that he may contest against bjp's prime ministerial candidate Modi in Varanasi
 haalanki, AAP ke is diggaj netaa ne kaha ki isse pehle ve varanasi kii janata se puuchhenge ki unhen vahaan se chunaav ladanaa chahie yaa nahin
 On the very next day after the BJP announced that Modi would be nominated for the Lok Sabha seat of Varanasi, Kejriwal hinted against him
 priyank sharma ke phans ke liye ek good news he, priyank ek baar phir big bos main entry karne ja rahe hai

 @ imro45's dismissal playing a reckless hoick when seemingly well settled shows how mad and bad India's approach has been today
 Positive intent without tact is pointless # indiavsauswhat was @imro45 thinking
 
 Is India playing a T20 or is India 350 / 4
 absolutely appalling shot by such a mature player
 He shouldn't have played in the first place in my books simply cos Vihari had done no wrong
 How can the shorter format be the basis for his selection # ausvind australia main test main yah chauthaa mauka tha, jab nothan ne rohit sharma ko apana shikaar banaaya
 Twice as much as any other bowler
 ab ab hi bataaen ki nothan ko rohit kaa sabase bada dushman na kahen, to kya kahen
 And this enmity is not going to end here

 bharat or pakistan kii samudri simaaon par ek rahasyamayi nauka dekhi gai
 Four people were riding on it
 kaha jaataa he ki unhone pakade jane ke dar se naav ko aag ke hawaale kar diya
 It was told in gestures that the country has been saved from a big incident like 26 / 11 Mumbai attack by stopping the boat on the way to Gujarat on 31 December
 is baat ko us vakt or bal mila, jab 5 janvari ko raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne jor dekar kaha ki naav par aatankwaadi savaar the
 He said that the security forces did the right thing at the 'right time'
 tatarakshak bal ke adhikari kehete hai ki yah ghatana 26 / 11 ke baad tateey suraksha ko lekar unki nai mustaidi ko jaij tehraati he
 Naval and Coast Guard surveillance teams searched and intercepted more than 45,000 boats and ships last year sniffing out potential threats to security on Indian beaches
 ek tatarakshak afasar ne india today se kaha, “hamane khufia soochnaaon kaa peechha karte hue safal oparation kii apni kaabiliyat dikhaa di he
 On the frontiers of our Exclusive Economic Zone, we can very quickly chase and catch suspicious traces
 ”asal main is oparation kii jad main he 26 november, 2008 kii shaam mumbai hamale ko anjaam dene se lashkar-e-tayba (vibhinn agenciyon kii ore se) ko roak paane kii naakaam koshish
 At least 26 warnings were issued at the time that terrorists could target several locations in India's financial capital, including hotels
 inamen ek chetavanee behad ahm thi, jo 10 hamalaavaron ke mumbai se kaaphi dur hone par hi jari kar di gai thi
 If heeded, the heinous attack could have been prevented
 19 november, 2008 ko intelligence beuro (ibi) ne bhartiya nausena or tatarakshak bal ko puure ek panne kii chetavanee bheji thi
 It was stamped 'top Secret, Most Immediate' (highly confidential, prompt attention) and signed by a joint director of the IB
 research and analysis wing (ro) ke ek sandesh main lashkar kii ek sandigdh nauka ke bare main sanket diya gaya tha ki vah thik-thik kis sthaan par hogiah uttar main 24 degree 16” 36” or purv main 67 degree 0“ 04” par
 raw's warning stated that Schnev was trying to infiltrate ”
 isamen ‘ghuspaith ko rokane ke liye jaruri karrwai’ kii salaah di gai thi
 It was the Lashkar fishing boat al-hussaini, which set out on its mission four days later on 23 November with 10 heavily armed terrorists
 neuyork times, propublica or frontline pibies kii 21 disambar, 2014 kii ek padtaal main enese ke karmchaaree edward snowden ke li kiye gaye vargeekrut dastavejon ke hawaale se bataaya gaya he ki mumbai hamale ke liye lashkar kii taiyaari ke bare main british or america jasusi agenciyon ke paas dheron suchanaaen thim, lekin ve unka thik-thik matlab samajhne main naakaam raheen
 He referred to a CIA report dated November 18, 2008, sent to India's anti-terror investigative agencies, about the location of a Pakistani boat at a certain location linked to the threat of a let attack on Mumbai
 ibi kii 19 november kii chetavanee sambhawatah siie kii isi report par aadhaarit thi
 Between 19 and 23 November, Coast Guard forces carried out search flights on the coast of Gujarat from Dornier planes and four patrol boats and a hovercraft were also launched to find this suspected Lashkar boat
 unhone pashchimi samudr tat par 276 naavon ko rokkar unki talaashi lee thi, lekin jahiraa taur par ve ek bhartiya nauka emvi kuber ko pakadaaey main naakaam rahe, jis par savaar hokar aatankwaadi mumbai main kahar barapaane nikle the
 Even after several requests, the IB did not give further information about the Lashkar boat to the Coast Guard
 tatarakshak bal ne jahaan furti se karrwai kii, vahiin nausena ne udaseenta barti
 On 2 December 2008, Admiral Surish Mehta stated in a press conference that the intelligence warnings the Navy received were 'not actionable'
 nausena ke khufia afasar kehete hai ki ibi kii chetavanee main jo jagah bataai gai thi, vah karachi bandargah se mahaj 30 samudri mile dur thi or pakistan kii samudri seemaa ke bheetar thi
 Importantly, the navy stamped 'NFA' (no action required) or 'no action required' on this warning and did not send it to the Western Naval Command in Mumbai for further action
 yah bheeshan bhul thi kyonki us vakt pashchimi bede ke 30 se zyada yudhpot ‘gujarat kii pratiraksha’ ke tahat abhyaas ke liye samudr main hi the
 Six years later a different story came out
 31 disambar ko subah 7
 Within two hours of receiving an alert from the National Technical Research Organization (NTRO) at 30 am, a Dornier patrol aircraft of the Coast Guard departed from Porbandar Airport
 alert main samudr ke bheetar ek ‘vastu’ ke hone kaa zikr kiya gaya tha, jo pakistani sena or samudri suraksha agency ke saath sampark main thi
 Four more Dornier aircrafts also made one flight from Porbandar Airport at 12 noon, 4 pm, 7 pm and 10 pm, so that one aircraft would always follow the boat
 raat 10
 At 30, the Coast Guard patrol boat CGS Rajaratan surrounded the suspect boat
 600 meter kii surakshit duuri se 20 foot lambii rajratan ke peechha karne or rukne ke liye kehane par naav badahavaas bhaagane lagi
 The chase ended at 3 pm after midnight, when the boat appeared surrounded by fiery flames
 tatarakshak bal ke afasar kehete hai ki naav par savaar logon ne khud hi apane ko aag laga lee
 At least two people aboard the boat are believed to have jumped into the water and died drowning
 baaki do aag se jalakar mar gaye
 On 4 December, Alsubah, at about 4am west of Porbandar, about 365 km west of the boat sank, as the flames ceased to appear
 naav kii pahchaan abhi sabit honi he
 On 2 January, a Defense Ministry statement initially called it a fishing boat, originating from Katie Bunder, near Karachi, 'with the intention of doing illegal work in the Arabian Ocean'
 isse taskar oparation kii sambhaavna kaa sanket miltaa tha
 Among the messages NTRO intercepted were that the boaters were talking about 'delivering goods' and 'depositing them to lesser bank accounts' with their contacts sitting on the shores
 lekin inamen maal ke byore nahin bataae gaye the
 Another boat with this mysterious boat is believed to have turned back towards Pakistan before the Coast Guard's Dornier aircraft arrived at the front
 is afsane main sabase abujh paheli aag he
 Why did boat riders prefer to die rather than surrender? Parrikar considers this to be evidence of him being a terrorist
 unhone kaha, “yahaan tak ki nashile padaarth le ja rahi ek saamaanya naav bhi nashile padaarth samudr main phenkakar samarpan kar degi
 No one will kill himself unless he is intent on doing so
 ”tatarakshak bal ke afasar aktubar 1999 kii ek ghatana kaa zikr karte hai
 The incident took place with MV Alondra Rainbow, a Japanese cargo ship, which the Indonesian pirates captured and brought to the Arabian Sea
 jab tatarakshak bal ke jahaajon ne us jahaaj ko gher liya, to luteron ne use tabah karne ke makasad se usamen aag laga di thi
 Prabhakaran Paleri, former director general of the Coast Guard, says, "it is quite possible that the people in this boat want to destroy the evidence on the boat that they could be trapped
" isi dauraan aag bekaabu ho gai
 “the debris of the boat lies about 2,000 meters below sea level, due to which it is difficult to find any conclusive evidence
 alabatta is mudde ne rajnatik partiyon ko aapasi yudgh ke liye kaaphi gola-barood de di he
 When Congress spokesperson Ajay Kumar questioned the government's theory of terrorist attack, in response, BJP President Amit Shah accused him of 'fighting on behalf of Pakistan'
 tatarakshak bal ke ek afasar ke mutabik congress yahaan ek baat kaa khyaal rakhane se chook gai ki 26 / 11 ke baad taton kii raksha ke kaam main jo bhi mustaidi ai he, chaahe vah agenciyon ke bich talmail ho yaa tatarakshak balon kii taadaad ko doguna karnaa ho, vah sab upie ke shasankaal kii viraasat he
 Who should remember such things in a political battle? aam aadmi party (AAP) se nikaale gaye prashanth bhushnane mangalvaar ko party or arvind kejariwal par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 He called the AAP a Khap Panchayat, while comparing Arvind Kejriwal to the dictator

 Ajit Jha, who was expelled from the party, said, 'if a deadline is found from somewhere, the committee had to work

 rohit ne ieenes se kaha, 'maine itihaas rachaa he or is kaaran main chahta hum ki mere jaise adhik se adhik log aage aaen or is tarah kii sanstha kii aguwai karen
 Rohit, who was not in the mood to discuss the problems faced in college due to being Hindi-speaking, said, 'in the first year i used to face problems due to weak English but i am lucky to have good friends and teachers

 He did a biopic of Manto before Thackeray
 is par navaj ne majaak main kaha- "main to chahta tha ki mairi com kii bhi byopic main hi karun
 "kapil asked Nawaz if his biopic was made, how many actresses would be in it
 bataa den ki kapil sharma main ab tak vicky kaushal, yami gautam, ranvir singh, sara ali khan, saleem khan, salmaan khan, arbaj khan, shatrughna sinha aadi najar aa chuke hai
 Salman Khan is producing this show of k and many old comrades have also returned in this show of Kapil
 kapil kii is teesri pari main chandan prabhakar, kiku sharada, sumona chakravarti jaise sitare maujuud hai
 Apart from this, some new actors like Krishna Abhishek and Bharti Singh have also been a part of the show
 release ke pehle hafte main hi da kapil sharma sho kii tiarapy main jabardast oochaal dekhne ko mila tha
 Kapil has also decided to return his popular character Rajesh Arora on the show
 bollywood kebaad siyasat main duusari pari khel raheen abhinetri jayaprada (jaya Prada) amar singh ko apana ‘godfadar' maanati hai
 Although Jayaprada says that even if he ties a rakhi to Amar Singh, people will not stop making talks about him
 jayaprada ne sapa netaa or rampur se vidhayak ajam khan par bhi gambhir aarope lagaae or daawa kiya ki ajam khaanne unke upar tejaab hamalaa karaane kii koshish kii thi
 Let me tell you that a former Lok Sabha member from Rampur in Uttar Pradesh formed the Rashtriya Lok Manch with Amar Singh after he was expelled from the SP
 jayaprada ne amar singh ke saath apane sambandhon ke bare main nakaaratmak baaten kiye jane par kaha, ‘mere jivan main kai logon ne meri madad kii he or amar singh ji mere god fadar hai'
 During the conversation at the Queensline Literature Festival in Mumbai, Jayaprada claimed, 'in the circumstances in which i was contesting as a woman with Azam Khan, i was under acid attack and my life was in danger
 
 
 jab kabhi main ghar se baahar jaati main apni maa ko yah bhi nahin bataa sakati thi ki main jinda lautoongi yaa nahin'
 He said that no leader came forward to support him
 madhya pradesh main ret kaa avaidh utkhanan maamalajab apane hi mantri ke bayaan se ghir gai congreshmadhya pradesh main ret kaa avaidh utkhanan hameshaa se hi ek bada mudda rahaa he
 First, the Congress lashed out at Shivraj Singh Chauhan's family and his close friends, accusing them of illegal mining
 vahiin congress avaidh utkhanan ke maamle main sawaalon ke ghere main aa gai he vah bhi sarkaar ke mantri kii ore se
 After all, how the Congress, which had accused Shivraj of illegal mining, got himself caught in the case of illegal mining, read this report
 darasal, madhya pradesh main beete 15 saalon ke dauraan bijepi ke shashan kaal main pramukh vipakshi party congress ne avaidh utkhanan ko bada mudda banaaya tha
 Even the Congress had fiercely accused the relatives and close relatives of the then Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, involved in illegal mining
 congress ke varisht netaa or rajyasabha saansad digvijay singh ne to narmada parikrama ke dauraan shivaraj singh chouhan par narmada nadi ko chalni karne tak ke aarope lagaae
 At the same time, when the Congress came to power in Madhya Pradesh after 15 years, then itself has stood in the dock regarding illegal mining
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki congress sarkaar ko avaidh utkhanan ke maamle main gherne vaale koi or nahin balki khud kamalnath sarkaar ke cabinet mantri doctor govind singh hai
 In the Kamal Nath government, General Administration Minister Govind Singh, while putting his own government in the dock, said that the issue of illegal mining in the BJP rule was raised from the road to the assembly but now it is our government and i have not been able to fulfill the promise made to the public
 i am vahiin govind singh ne kaha, '15 saalon main vipaksh main rahakar jitne vaade janata se kiye the wo ab puure nahin hone par mujhase sawaal puche jate hai
 i will soon meet CM Kamal Nath in this matter
 'bataa den ki doctor govind singh bhind jile ke lahaar vidhansabha se vidhayak hai or kamalnath sarkaar main saamaanya prashasan vibhaag ke mantri hai
 The Chambal River originates from his district, which consists of large-scale illegal mining
 jiske khilaaf vipaksh main rahete hue doctor govind singh ne khub ladaai ladi or ab jab sarkaar ai to avaidh utkhanan par koi karrwai na hote dekh unka dard chhalak hi gaya
 However, on the allegations of its minister, the Congress is in trouble
 mantri kii baat kaa khandan bhi nahin kar sakate or agar samarthan kiya to sidhe-sidhe nishane par aa jaaenge
 On the talk of his fellow minister, another minister of the state, PC Sharma, has given a statement that the media should understand Govind Singh's sentiment
 unka gussa sarkaar par nahin balki avaidh utkhanan par he or agar unhen vaaki koi naaraazgi he to iskaa niraakaran kiya jayega
 When the Congress, which accused the Shivraj government of most illegal mining, was surrounded by the statement of its own minister, then obviously BJP had to get a chance
 bijepi kii taraf se front foot par aakar morcha sambhala khud shivaraj singh chouhan ne jo hameshaa avaidh utkhanan ke maamle main congress ke nishane par rahe the
 Speaking to Aaj Tak, Shivraj said, 'the entire river has been dug up, the mountains have been dug up
 upar se lekar neeche tak bandhe hai
 This minister is saying
 yah gajab sarkaar he
 Stop this loot, Chief Minister
 isi ko to andher nagari chaupat raja kehete hai
 There will be a movement against illegal mining
 'darasal madhyapradesh main narmada tawa chambal samet kai choti-badi nadiyon main dhadlle se avaidh utkhanan hota rahaa he
 While this has adversely affected the ecosystem of the rivers, the state exchequer has also lost several thousand crores of rupees and in such a situation the Congress promised to curb illegal mining by making it an issue during the elections
 Was but even after 9 months, Congress has not been able to fulfill its promise
 release ho gai 'cocktail', jisamen saf ali khan aawaara or dilaphenk yuvak gautam ke role main hai, jo chutki bajaate ladakiyon kaa dil jeet letaa he, lekin kamitment se dur rahata he
 
 
 Such is the fun of Fitrat Veronica, played by Deepika Padukone on screen
 
 
 mira, yani dyna painti, bilkul sidhi-saadi ladki he, jo ek dhokhe kaa shikaar hokar landan aa pahunchi he
 
 
 Now the story begins
 
 
 landan main ek-ek kar teenon kirdaar ek-duusare se milte hai
 
 
 They share moments of happiness together
 
 
 lekin jab in teenon ke dilon main ek-duusare ke liye sachche pyaar kii bhavanaaen aa jaati hai, sabaki zindagi dukh se bhar jaati he
 
 
 The first half of Slow Start director Homi Adajania's 'cocktail' is very funny
 
 
 deepika, saf, saf ke mamaa bane boman irani, or maa ke role main dimpal kapaadiya par kai zordaar seens hai, or in kirdaaron ke van-liners to aapako hansaa-hansaakar lotpot kar denge
 
 
 Imtiaz Ali has no qualms in understanding the psychology of love, who wrote the film with Sajid Ali
 
 
 imtiyaaz ne pyaar kii choti se choti feeling ko bhi behad baariki se pesh kiya he
 
 
 Deepika Padukone has portrayed a wonderfully fashionable and fair-skinned girl
 
 
 nai actress dyna painti bhi impressive rahi
 
 
 Saif Ali Khan has been accumulating in the role of flirt since the beginning of his career
 
 
 upar se preetam kaa music bhi kamaal kaa he
 
 
 The comments lekin dukh hota he, jab interval tak itani impressive rahi film second half main kuch hi samay baad doobane lagati he
 
 
 Love Triangle (love triangle) brings sadness with itself, but wish, boredom with sadness is not free
 
 
 lagane lagata he, jaise second half main riter-diarector ke paas kehane ko kahani hi nahin bachi thi, isiilie saf, deepika or dyna ke kirdaaron ko unhone lambe-lambe dialogs se lad diya
 
 
 You realize the taste of this 'cocktail' very slowly, so if you have so much patience then 'cocktail' is for you
 
 
 film ke liye hamaari reating he - 2
 5 stars
 
 
 ab kahani shuru hoti he
 
 
 The three characters meet each other one by one in London
 
 
 ek saath main khushiyon ke pal baantate hai
 
 
 But when the feelings of true love for each other come in the hearts of these three, everyone's life is filled with sorrow
 
 
 dhimi shuruyaat vaali diarector homi adzania kii 'cocktail' kaa first half behad mazedaar he
 
 
 Deepika, Saif, Saif's maternal uncle Boman Irani, and the role of mother Dimple Kapadia have many strong scenes, and the one-liners of these characters will make you laugh and laugh
 
 
 pyaar kii psychology samajhane main imtiyaaz ali kaa koi sani nahin, jinhone sajid ali ke saath yah film likhi he
 
 
 Imtiaz has also introduced the smallest feeling of love very closely
 
 
 deepika padukon ne ascharyajanak dhang se fashneble zindagi se labalab or safdil ladki kaa behtareen kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 
 
 The new actress Diana Penty was also impressive
 
 
 saf ali khan to apane kariyar kii shuruyaat se hi flert ke role main jamate aae hai
 
 
 Above all, Pritam's music is also amazing
 
 
 tippaniyan But it hurts when the film, which was so impressive till the interval, starts sinking shortly after in the second half
 
 
 lav trengal (prem trikon) apane saath udaasi lekar aata he, lekin kaash, udaasi ke saath boriyat muft na milti
 
 
 It seems as if in the second half the writer-director had no story left to tell, that's why he smothered the characters of Saif, Deepika and Diana with long dialogues
 
 
 is 'cocktail' ke surur kaa ehsaas aapako bahut dhire-dhire hota he, so, agar aapmen itnaa sabar he to 'cocktail' aapke liye he
 
 
 Our rating for the film is - 2
 5 star

 With Jharkhand Chief Minister Shibu Soren remaining just two and a half months to become a member of the state assembly, the ally BJP said it would contest the by-election to fulfill its constitutional obligation
 bhaajapa kii rajya ikai ke pramukh or up pradhanmantri raghuvar das ne samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ‘sanvaidhanik baadhyataa ke bare main sab jaanate hai
 Guruji (soren) himself has said many times that he will contest the by-election
 ’yah puche jane par ki sorain ke liye kisi vidhayak ne seat khaali kyon nahin ki jabaki unke sadan main sadsy ke rup main pravesh karne ke liye maatr 75 din bache hai, das ne kaha, ‘pardaa uthne tak pratiksha kijiye
 On the question of the possibility of any successor being considered by the alliance, he said that the media should not remain in such confusion
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaari sarkaar paanch saal kaa kaarykaal safaltaapurvak puraa karegi
 Lok Sabha member Soren was sworn in as the Chief Minister of the JMM-BJP coalition government on 30 December
 rajya vidhansabha main sadsy ke rup main unke pravesh kii samaysima june ant main samaapt ho rahi he
 To allay the displeasure of Dalits, the Narendra Modi government brought an amendment bill to restore the SC / ST Act to its original form and got it passed
 itnaa hi nahin supreme court main SC / ST karmchaariyon ko pramotion main rigerveshan die jane ke paksh main sarkaar khadi he
 The original votebank of the BJP (savarna) seems restless on the Dalits of the Modi government
 agle saal 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav se pehle modi sarkaar ne dalit samudaay se jude do ahm faisle liye hai
 The objective of this move of the government is being considered in the context of helping Dalits in electoral politics
 daliton se jude donon muddon par sarkaar dwaara uthaae gaye kadam se savarna samudaay main acchhee khaasi naaraazgi he
 BJP MLA Surendra Singh from Baria, Ballia has come out against the SC-STACT
 itnaa hi nahin party kaaryakarta bhi kahin na kahin acroshit hai
 The upper caste leaders of the party are not speaking openly, but are expressing their pain with suppressed tongue
 aresas kii shakhaon main bhi in dinon ise lekar charchaa joro par he
 BJP MLA Surendra Singh said that the Supreme Court's decision regarding SCST Act was correct under which there was a provision for arrest after investigation of the complainant's allegations
 surendra singh ne sansad ke faisle kaa virodh karte hue kaha ki savarnon ko apane adhikaar or sammaan ke liye sadakon par aana chahie
 Surendra Singh called all the parties responsible for the change in the SC-ST Act and asked whether the parties do not need the vote of 78 percent people who are doing injustice to majority people for 22 percent Dalit vote
 unhone kaha ki bharat main dalit vot kii lut kii hode machi he, lekin chaahe puraa samaaj jal jaae isse kisi ko fark nahin pad rahaa
 a BJP MP, on the condition of anonymity, said that not only the upper caste community but also the obcs are angry about it
 ham log kashmakash kii haalat main hai
 The upper caste community is not going to answer
 pratapgarh ke rahane vaale bijepi kaaryakarta rajendra singh kehete hai ki ve 30 saal se party ke liye ek kaaryakarta ke rup main kaam kar rahaa hum
 The action taken by the government in the SC / ST Act case has come as a shock
 supreme court ne is sambandh main behatar faisla diya tha
 But the Modi government has reapplied the court's order by delaying it
 isse savarna samudaay main bijepi ke khilaaf behad naaraazgi he
 Rajendra says that it is not necessary for the Dalit community to vote for the BJP
 iske baad bhi sarkaar ne essi / asti act main badlaav karke apane guarantee vot ko naaraaz kar diya he
 We will not go to vote in 2019
 kyonki sapa, basapa or bijepi main ab koi fark nahin rah gaya he
 The BJP MP said on the condition of anonymity that not only the upper caste community but also the obcs are angry about it
 ham log kashmakash kii haalat main hai
 The upper caste community is not going to answer
 kshetra main har jagah yahi sawaal kiye ja rahe hai
 This move of the government is being discussed not only in the BJP but also in the branches of RSS
 purvanchal ke ek jila prachaarak ne naam na chhapane kii shart par bataaya ki essi / asti act par sarkaar dwaara uthaae gaye kadam ko lekar sawaal kiye ja rahe hai
 There is resentment of the government's move, especially among the upper caste community
 dalit utpeedan ke jis tarah se maamle lagaataar saamne aa rahe hai
 In such a situation, if SC / ST Act is effectively implemented in the case of Dalit oppression, then it will have a direct impact on the upper caste and OBC community
 iskaa sidhaa asar raajnneeti main dekhne ko milegaa

 However, many trains have been affected due to the accident

 There has been a belief in our country for centuries that a man should marry a girl younger than him

 In such a situation, if a person is big, then he will caress the younger
 isse rishton main madhurata bani rahegi
 Apart from this, the condition of women associated with menopause and conceiving also supports that if the girl is younger, the relationship will be better

 But who would like me like you

 However, the matter of Ghazals
 
 
 umrao jaan kii ye ghazal, jo khud talat ne nahin sochi thi ki itani makabool ho jaaegi
 Whenever life brings you in our spirit, we see better than the moon, why do we have the outcome of every meeting? Now, the same thing haunts us all the time, Talat Aziz said that we do not slap anyone with ghazal, do not abuse, hence the news i usually do not come

 gujarat main ahamed patel kii rajyasabha chunaav jeet ke baad congress ab gujarat vidhansabha chunaav par focus kar rahi he
 As part of the strategy, the party called these mlas to Delhi on Rajiv Gandhi's birthday
 is dauraan khaas khyaal rakhaa gaya ki sabhi vidhayakon or netaaon ko ekajute dikhaaya jaae
 For this, mlas were brought from the airport to Gujarat Bhavan in two buses
 ye bhi tay hua ki sabhi aadhikarik jagahon par sabhi vidhayak inhen bason main saath jaaenge
 The leaders sitting in the bus told Aaj Tak that wherever they go in Delhi they will go together like this
 patel ke janmdin par sonia-rahul se mili vidhayakiske baad 21 agast ko ahamed patel ke janmdin par sabhi vidhayak ahamed patel, prabharee ashok gahalot, pradesh adhyaksh bharat singh solanki or shakti singh gohil ke netritv main sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi se mili
 Sonia and Rahul asked all the mlas to win the party in the assembly elections while maintaining the solidarity of the Rajya Sabha elections
 navasrujan gujarat or sachche din ke nareis par vidhayakon or netaaon ne sonia va rahul ko apana naaraa bataaya ki ve 'navasrujan gujarat' or 'achche nahin, sachche din' kaa naaraa lekar janata ke bich jaaenge
 In fact, the Gujarat Congress believes that the youth of 18 to 35 years have not seen the Congress rule in the state
 isliye navasrujan gujarat yani nae gujarat ke udai kaa naaraa banaaya he
 Also, the slogan of 'good days, not true days' will be used in Gujarat by calling Ahmed Patel's Rajya Sabha election victory as truth
 1 sitambar ko balsad main rahul kii relyiske baad congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne sabhi vidhyakon se kaha, 'main khud gujarat main 1 sitambar se aap logon ke sahyog ke liye or congress ke chunavi abhiyaan ko majbootee dene ke liye balsad ke nalaponda main raily karne aauungaa
 Rahul's statement once again made it clear that in Gujarat, that too should be a political battle between Gujarat Congress vs Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Rahul vs Modi
 BJP ne vidhayakon ko diya tha 25 karod kaa ofrais parsonia or rahul se mulaakaat ke baad congresaneta shakti singh gohil ne kaha, 'hamaare garib vidhayakon ko rajyasabha chunaav kii aakhri raat 25 karod rupee or bijepi kaa tikat tak ofer diya gaya
 Our legislators told all this to Rahul and Soniaji
 ' vahiin gujarat kii ladaai kaa zikr karte hue gohil ne kaha ki gujarat congress hi gujarat main gujarat bijepi ko haraayegi
 Gujarat Congress is excited: On August 22, all the mlas will leave for Tirupati temple after dinner on the birthday of Ahmad Patel
 kul milakar arase se gujarat main satta se baahar congress ko ek rajyasabha kii jeet se josh to mila he, lekin usko yaad rakhana hoga ki rajyasabha kii jeet kaaphi had tak management kii jeet he, jisamen vot uski hi party ke vidhayakon ko dena tha
 Whereas, in the assembly elections, the people have to vote

 aam chunaav 2019 dastak de rahaa he or beete chaar saal se shant baithe endie ke ghatak dal mukhar hone lage hai
 On Tuesday, Ram Vilas Paswan of the Lok Janshakti Party, the main constituent of the NDA, while giving a statement on the social status of the country, said that he is neither a bonded laborer of BJP at present nor has he ever been with Lalu Prasad Yadav's RJD There were bonded laborers at the time of the alliance
 endie ke ghatak dalon main sirf algepi kaa aisa sochna nahin he
 LJP chief Paswan has strongly supported Nitish Kumar's demand for special status to Bihar
 paswan ne kaha ki nitish kumaar kii maang puri tarah se jaij he or unki maang par kisi tarah se gathbandhan ko thes nahin pahunchni chahie
 Therefore, this interaction between Paswan and Nitish is a clear indication that the BJP is ready to challenge the NDA and it should now understand that the constituents of the alliance will not remain as silent spectators in this election year as in the last four years
 
 gauratlab he ki bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne rajya ke liye vishesh darje kii maang aise vakt main doharaai he, jab kendra main modi sarkaar ne vishesh darje kii puri prakriya ko thande baste main daal diya he
 Due to this stance of Modi government, it has earlier lost out to the Telugu Desam Party, a major constituent of NDA in Andhra Pradesh and its miraculous leadership Chandrababu Naidu in the south
 nitish kumaar kii yah maang bijepi ke sheersh netaaon ko bhi nagavar guzar rahi he
 BJP leaders argue that following the recommendations of the 15 Finance Commission, it is totally baseless for a state to demand special state status
 gauratlab he ki 15wein vitt ayog ne haal hi main vishesh rajya ke darje par sawaal uthaate hue sifarish kii he ki maujuuda kendra-rajya aarthik sambandhon ko dekhte hue ab vishesh darje kaa koi mahatv nahin bachaa he
 Read this: Not Modi, Yogi's head will be lost in kairana-noorpur, the difficulty will be increased, Nitish's demand for BJP leadership is going through the growing friendship between Ram Vilas Paswan and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party leader Upendra Kushwaha
 gauratlab he ki haal hi main kushvaha or nitish kumaar kii mulaakaat hui thi, jiske baad nitish kii vishesh darje kii maang par ramvisaal paswan kaa yah nayaa sur sunai diya he
 In view of the result of this tussle in the constituents of NDA, the results of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections - 31 seats in the 40 seats of Bihar went to the nda's account and the BJP got 22 seats in this
 vahiin endie ke ghatak dalon main bijepi ko chhodkar baaki dalon ko 9 siton se santosh karnaa padaa
 This is the reason why JDU, LJP and RLSP are once again feeling the need to get organized just before the 2019 elections, so that they can perform better than BJP in 2019 if they are united in the nda's position
 haalanki jahaan yah kavayad ghatak dalon kaa endie main apni saudebaaji ko majboot karne ke alaava ek or vikalp par bhi sanket karti he
 Significantly, Jeetan Ram Manjhi, the bjp's experiment boy in the NDA, left the alliance in February and has now gone to the option of joining the RJD for better political stature
 vahiin aisi hi kuch chunauti bijepi ko maharashtra main shivasena se mil rahi he
 The Shiv Sena has made it clear that it will not stand with the BJP in the 2019 elections
 or iskaa trailor usne pichley vidhansabha chunaav samet is madhyavadhi chunaav main dikhaa bhi diya he
 Therefore, along with all these constituents of NDA, the Akali Dal in Punjab and PDP in Jammu and Kashmir are also ready to strike a hard bargain with BJP in this election year
 aise main dekhnaa yah he ki kya akali dal se haal main mili naseehat ki bijepi apane gathbandhan saathiyon ke saath acha bartaav kare par party amal karti he? Vice President Nusrat Ali and General Secretary Engineer Mohammad Salim and other officials were present in this press conference of jamaat-e-islami Hind

 Who will take responsibility for it? 1 in India between 2008 and 2015
 11 karod bachche apana paanchavaa janmdin nahin manaa paae
 The shocking fact is that 62 of these

 piyush goyal bole- modi he to mumkin haivyapak asar ke bina faisla nahin letaa sarkaar: goyalindia today conklev main bharat sarkaar ke commers or rail mantri piyush goyal ne kaha ki puri duniya main koi aisa nahin he jo hamaari sarkaar yaa pradhanmantri narendra modi par dabaav bana sake
 He said this when he was asked whether there was a trump government or any international pressure to reduce corporate tax
 isapar piyush goyal ne jawaab diya ki puri duniya main koi aisa aaj tak hua hi nahin jo piem modi par dabaav bana sake
 Piyush Goyal further said that it is true that there are many types of pressures while taking any decision
 logon ke centiments hote hai
 But the decision is taken only when it appears to have a wide impact
 dimonatidation kaa faisla isliye nahin tha ki bazaar or logon kii jeb se paisa nikaal len
 There is pressure on the financial ecosystem behind any decision, it involves many factors
 pehle main piem modi or vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ko badhai detaa hum ki unhone aaj jo kiya wo bada kaam he
 It is possible if Modi is there
 or mumkin kii koi paribhaasha nahin hoti
 The PM himself does a very thorough study before making any decision
 iske baad hi koi nirnay hota he
 It is because of these decisions that things move forward
 aisa to pehali baar hua he ki koi sarkaar dimonetigeshan or jiesti ke baad dobaaraa chunakar ai ho, vah bhi zyada voton ke saath
 Opposition keeps speaking
 iskaa matlab ye nahin ki ham kade faisle lenaa band kar den
 Reducing corporate tax will further benefit the country by reducing corporate tax by about 1
 45 lakh karod kaa nuksaan hoga
 On this, Goyal said that there may be some damage from this now, but next year will definitely see its benefit
 iske pehle bhi dimonetigeshan se bhi garib ko koi nuksaan nahin hua
 But people were convinced that now a man has come who can take a tough decision
 koi sarkaar he jo bhrashtachar mitaanaa chaahati he
 Some people may feel bad
 ye wo log hai jo hamen suut-boot kii sarkaar kehete hai
 But, people believe that we have pms who make big decisions

 film kaa naam : nanu kii janudiarector: faraj haiderstar cast: abhaya deol ,patralekha rajesh sharma ,manu rishi chadlaavadhi:2 ghanta 13 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 2 stardiarector faraj haidar ne 'waar chhod naa yaar' film 2013 main banaai thi, jise mili juli pratikriya mili thi 
 This time Faraj has tried to laugh and scare through horror comedy
 film main kai saalon ke baad abhaya deol dikhaai dene vaale hai vahiin duusari taraf abhinetri patralekha bhi najar aane vaali he
 Know how the film is
 kahanefilm kii kahani dilli ke rahane vaale nanu ( abhaya deol) kii he, jiskaa kaam logon kaa makaan galat tareeke se hathiyaane kaa he
 Nanu is also assisted by the rest of his friends in this work
 nanu kii jindagi main badlaav us din se shuru ho jaataa he jab uski janu urf siddhi( patralekha) kii entry hoti he
 In the flat in which Nanu lives, various activities are also started which he is scared to see, Nanu, who once used to intimidate anyone and grab the flat, now becomes afraid of the ghost
 kahani main nanu kii mata or janu ke pita kii bhi maujuudagi hoti he jiske saath hi bahut saare mode bhi aate hai, antat kya hota he, yah jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 REVIEW: The story of Beyond the Clouds is breathless, Ishaan's acting was also a very good one liner for the average weak film
 trailor dekhakar ke lag rahaa tha ki kahani kaaphi dilachasp hone vaali he lekin film dekhne ke dauraan khoda pahaad nikali chuhia jaisi vaali feeling aane lagi
 The story of the film is very weak and the way in which sequential events happen is also disappointing
 vaise to film kaa mood horer kamedi kaa he lekin bahut kam pal aise aate hai jahaan par aap ko dar lagata he yaa aap thahaake maar kar hans pate hai
 And the climax of the film is also very weak, which if corrected, it would have been called a very crisp film
 film dekhte vakt aisa lag rahaa tha jaise abhaya deol abhinay or haavbhaav ke liye bahut zyada prayaas kar rahe hai, free flo acting najar nahin aa rahi thi
 The screenplay of the film is also quite weak
 aakhir kyon dekhen?abhinetri patralekha ke kaaphi kam seen he lekin unhone sahaj abhinay kiya he, vahiin manu rishi chaddha kii line aapke chehre par muskaan laati he, film ke dauraan kai baar kuch aise pal saamne aate hai jab aapako halki-phulki hansi bhi aati he
 Review: After a long time, the best love story on screen, 'october' Varun's Best Filmbox Officefilm budget is being told about 10 crores and everything is going to depend on the earnings of the first 3 days, plus this film can be seen more on television is

 They are the five elements
 ve akaash, prithvi, jal, agni, vaayu, sabamein vyaapt hai, ve atal hai, ve ab bhi hai
 When i met him for the first time, his memory is like that of yesterday
 itane bade netaa, itane bade vidwaan
 It seemed as if someone has come out from the world beyond the glass
 jiskaa itnaa naam suna tha, jisko itnaa padhaa tha, jisase bina mili, itnaa kuch siikhaa tha, vah mere saamne tha
 When my name came out of his mouth for the first time, it felt like there is just too much to get
 bahut dinon tak meraa naam leti hui unki vah awaz mere kaanon se takaraati rahi
 How can i believe that that voice is gone now? kabhi sochaa nahin tha, ki atal ji ke bare main aisa likhane ke liye kalam uthaani padegi
 The country and the world know Atal ji as a statesman, fluent speaker, sensitive poet, thought writer, sharp journalist and visionary journalist
 lekin mere liye unka sthaan isse bhi upar kaa tha
 Not only because i had the opportunity to work with him for many years, but the impression he left on my life, my thinking, my ideals and values, the faith he put on me, he has coined me, taught to be steadfast in every situation is
 hamaare desh main anek rishi, muni, sant atmaaon ne janm liya he
 Innumerable people have devoted their lives to the development journey from the independence of the country to the present day, but what Atal ji did for the defense of democracy after independence and a strong, secure India of the 21st century is unprecedented
 unke liye raashtra sarvopari tha - baaki sab kaa koi mahatv nahin
 India First - Bharat First, this mantra was his life goal
 pokharan desh ke liye zaruri tha, to chintaa nahin kii pratibandhon or aalochanaon kii, kyonki desh pratham tha
 If we do not get supercomputers, cryogenic engines are not available, we will not care, we will build ourselves, we will show ourselves to do impossible-looking tasks on the strength of our talent and scientific skills
 or aisa kiya bhi
 Surprised the world
 sirf ek takat unke bheetar kaam karti thi - 'desh pratham' kii zid
 The miracle of writing the 'skull of Kaal' and erasing the sun of victory in the clouds of strength, courage and challenges was in his chest, because it beats Sina for 'desh Pratham'
 isliye haar or jeet unke man par asar nahin karti thi
 Even if the government was formed, even if the government was dropped by one vote, in their voices, the defeat also had the power to turn victory into such a deceptive belief that the winner would give up
 atal ji kabhi li par nahin chale
 He created and set new avenues in social and political life
 'aandhiyon main bhi diye jalaane' kii kshamta unamem thi
 Whatever he spoke with complete impunity, he went straight into the heart of the public
 apni baat ko kaise rakhana he, kitna kahana he or kitna ankaha chhod dena he, isamen unhen maharath hasil thi
 Whatever he served the nation, he received many accolades for the great honor he gave to Maa Bharati's honor in the world
 deshavaasiyon ne unhen 'bharat ratna' dekar apana maan bhi badhaayaa
 But they were above any adjective, any respect
 jivan kaise jiyaa jaae, raashtra ke kaam kaise aayaa jaae, yah unhone apane jivan se dusron ko sikhaaya
 He used to say, "let us not live only for ourselves, but also for others
 
 
 ham raashtra ke liye adhikadhik tyaag karen
 If India's condition is pathetic, we cannot be respected in the world
 kintu yadi ham sabhi drushtiyon se susampann hai, to duniya hamaara sammaan karegi
 
 
 " desh ke garib, vanchit, shoshit ke jeevanaster ko upar uthaane ke liye ve jeevanabhar prayaas karte rahe
 He used to say, "poverty, poverty are not a matter of dignity, but it is helplessness, helplessness and the name of helplessness cannot be satisfied
 
 
 " karodon deshavaasiyon ko is vivashtaa se baahar nikaalane ke liye unhone har sambhav prayaas kiye
 In order to empower the poor, the system like Aadhaar, maximum simplification of procedures, road to every village, golden quadrilateral, world-class infrastructure in the country, was associated with their resolutions for nation building
 aaj bharat technology ke jis shikhar par khadaa he, uski aadharshila atal ji ne hi rakhi thi
 They could see far beyond their time - were dreamers, but also karmaveers
 kavi hriday, bhavuk man ke the, to parakramee sainik man vaale bhi the
 He traveled abroad
 jahaan-jahaan bhi gaye, sthaayee mitra banaae or bharat ke hiton kii sthaayee aadharshila rakhte gaye
 He was the voice of India's victory and development
 atal ji kaa prakhar rashtrawaad or raashtra ke liye samarpan karodon deshavaasiyon ko hameshaa se prerit karata rahaa he
 Nationalism was not just a slogan for him, but a way of life
 ve desh ko sirf ek bhukhand, zamin kaa tukdaa bhar nahin maanate the, balki ek jeevant, samvedansheel ikai ke rup main dekhte the
 "india is not a piece of land, it is a living patriot
 
 
 " yah sirf bhav nahin, balki unka sankalp tha, jiske liye unhone apana jivan nyochaavar kar diya
 He spent decades in public life to live this same thinking, to take it down on the surface
 apatkaal ne hamaare loktantr par jo daag lagaaya tha, use mitaane ke liye atal ji ke prayaas ko desh hameshaa yaad rakhega
 The spirit of patriotism and the inspiration of public service remained firm in his name
 bharat unke man main rahaa, bhartiyata tan main
 He considered the people of the country as his adorable
 bharat ke kan-kan, kankar-kankar, bharat kii boond-boond ko, pavitra or poojaneey mana
 The higher the honor, the higher he attained, the more he joined the land
 apni safalataa ko kabhi bhi unhone apane mastishk par prabhavi nahin hone diya
 Glory to God, many people wish for fame, but it was Atal ji who said, "he prabhu! mujhe itani oonchai kabhi mat dena
 Do not give so much attitude, i can not embrace the non-residents
 
 
 " This desire to be so easily and easily connected to his countrymen makes him stand on a different footing in social life
 ve pidaa sehate the, vednaa ko chupchaap apane bheetar samaae rahete the, par sabko amrit dete rahe - jeevanabhar
 When he was in trouble, he said - "the body is punished for dharn, all should be to Kahu, weeping cry with knowledgeable knowledge
" 
 
 " unhone gyaan maarg se atyant gahari vedanaaen bhi sahan kin or vitaragi bhav se vidaa le gaye
 If India was in their Rome, then the pangs of the world would penetrate their heart
 isi vajah se hiroshima jaisi kavitaaon kaa janm hua
 He was a world hero
 maa bharti ke sachche vaishvik nayak
 Modern Buddha establishing the message of India's fame and compassion beyond the borders of India
 kuch varsh pehle loksabhaa main jab unhen varsh ke sarvshereshth saansad ke sammaan se sammanit kiya gaya tha, tab unhone kaha tha, "yah desh bada adbhut he, anoothaa he
 Any stone being greeted with vermilion may be greeted
 
 
 "tippaniyan The dedication of his efforts, his dedication to the nation reflects the greatness of his personality
 yahi sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ke liye unka sabase bada or prakhar sandesh he
 Relying fully on the resources and resources of the country, we now have to fulfill Atal ji's dreams, make India his dreams
 nae bharat kaa yahi sankalp, yahi bhav liye main apni taraf se or sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii taraf se atal ji ko shradhanjali arpit karata hum, unhen naman karata hum
 Never thought that a pen would have to be raised to write about Atal ji
 desh or duniya atal ji ko ek statsman, dharapravaah vaktaa, samvedansheel kavi, vichaarvaan lekhak, dhardaar patrkaar or vijanary jananetaa ke taur par jaanati he
 But for me, their place was higher than this
 sirf isliye nahin ki mujhe unke saath barason tak kaam karne kaa avasar mila, balki mere jivan, meri soch, mere aadarshon-mulyon par jo chhap unhone chodi, jo vishwaas unhone mujh par kiya, usne mujhe gadha he, har sthiti main atal rahanaa sikhaaya he
 The miracle of writing the 'skull of Kaal' and erasing the sun of victory in the clouds of strength, courage and challenges was in his chest, because it beats Sina for 'desh Pratham'
 isliye haar or jeet unke man par asar nahin karti thi

 BSP national president Mayawati, who performed extremely poorly in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, was to address the workers
 purvaanh kareeb 11 baje basapa ke rashtriya mahasachiv nasimuddin siddiki ne jaise hi naare lagane shuru kiye, baithak kaa agenda spasht ho gaya
 "behenji you struggle, we are with you", Manyavar Kanshi Ram ji Amar ", after the well-known proclamation," Cancel the election from the voting machine, cancel "," Shame those who rigged the voting machine, shame Slogans like "restore the old voting system, restore" indicated the strategy of Mayawati after the bad election defeat
 kuch hi der baad mayawati chaaron ore se ek darjan commandon se ghiri laal batti lagi ambesder car se sabha sthal par pahunchin or likhaa hua bhaashan padhgaye kii apni style main bhaajapa par chunaav main electronic voting mashiinon (iviem) main dhaandhlee karke satta hathiyaane kaa aarope lagaakar party ke andolan kii ghoshnaa kar di
 The BSP will stage a sit-in at all district headquarters of the state on the 11th of every month till the result of the legal battle of rigging in evms
 mayawati ke liye chunaav nattejey kisi sadame se kam nahin hai
 The BSP may have got more than 22 per cent of the votes, but the party's 80 mlas were reduced to 19 seats, their weakness at the strategic level
 chunaav ayog ke nakaarne ke baavjood mayawati ne iviem main dhaandhlee kaa aarope laga ek ranneeti ke tahat pradeshvyapee andolan kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 Professor in the Department of Sociology at Banaras Hindu University, Dr
 ajit kumaar kehete hai, ''mayawati buree haar kii jimmedaari lene kii bajaae iviem par thikra phod samarthakon ko yah sandesh dena chaah rahi hai ki unhen sajeesh ke tahat satta se dur rakhaa gaya he
 "to make the movement a success, Mayawati has given a goal of mobilizing at least 5,000 activists to each of her coordinators at the district headquarters
 ambedkar mahasabha ke adhyaksh lalji nirmal basapa kii is ranneeti ko asal muddon se dhyaan bantane vaali qaraar dete hai
 Says Nirmal, "after the Lok Sabha elections, a part of the Dalit electorate is continuously losing out to the BSP in the assembly elections, to prevent this, Mayawati should decide the strategy based on the ground issues
 " mayawati ne 86 surakshit vidhansabha siton ke alaava do anya siton par dalit ummidavaar utaare the par inamen sirf do hi jeet sake
 This is the bsp's worst performance in the last 25 years (see box)
 usase zyada suheldev bhartiya samaaj party or apana dal ke dalit vidhayak jite hai
 Even more disheartening for the Dalit-based BSP is that the party could not make it to second place on more than half of the total 84 assembly seats reserved for Dalits (two seats are reserved for Scheduled Tribes)
 purvanchal ke ek jila koardinator yogendra kumaar bataate hai, ''savarna jatiyon kaa ''floating" vot basapa ko nahin milanaa surakshit siton par uske kharaab pradarshan kii mukhya vajah he
 The excessive focus on Muslim voters has also damaged the party
 " pichhali vidhansabha main basapa ke vidhanmandal dal ke netaa or bundelkhand se aane vaale jatav birdari ke netaa gayacharan dinakar ke chunaav haarane ke baad mayawati ne kurmi netaa lalji verma ko basapa vidhanmandal dal kaa netaa banaaya he
 BSP was overshadowed by ticketing of 99 Muslim candidates
 aazaadee ke baad yah pehla mauka tha jab kisi mukhya party ne is taadaad main muslim ummidavaaron ko utaara
 There are 140 assembly seats in the state on which the Muslim voters have a population of 20 percent or more
 in siton main 109 par bijepi, 2 par apana dal, 23 par sapa or basapa ko sirf do par jeet se santosh karnaa padaa
 The support of many Muslim Ulema, including Shahi Imam Syed Ahmed Bukhari of Jama Masjid, Delhi, could not muster unilateral support of the BSP to Muslims
 avadh vishvavidhyalay, faijabad main associat professor dow
 Mohammad Ismail Khan says, "the bsp's strategy to get the support of Muslims revolved only around the national general secretary Nasimuddin Siddiqui
 sthaneey str par muslim netaaon ko aage na karne se party apane paksh main maahaul banane main naakaam rahi
 "at the same time, the results of the bsp's stronghold Ambedkar Nagar district showed a glimpse of Mayawati's old social engineering success
 dalit or ati pichhadaa bahulya is jile kii paanch main se teen siton par basapa kaa paracham laharaaya he, jabaki pichley vidhansabha chunaav main vah sabhi siton par haar gai thi
 Lalji Verma, the two biggest leaders of the most backward castes in the BSP, has won elections from the Katehari assembly seat of Ambedkar Nagar and state president Ram Achal Rajbhar Akbarpur assembly seat
 saaf he, dalit or atipichhadaa janaadhar aaj bhi basapa ke liye jitau he
 If Mayawati managed to bring this mass base back before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, only then would she be able to reverse

 unke pradesh main keval 39 siten hai jabaki ek seat kahin or se vah aane kii baat kar rahi hai jabaki uttar pradesh main to 80 siten hai
 In such a situation, you win only 70 seats, then look amazing
 ' For the World Cup 2015, a list of 15 players who will go to Australia and New Zealand to save the crown of the head of Team India
 jo team world cap ke liye chuni gai he usko lekar jahaan kai diggaj santusht dikhe to kahin asantosh kii lahar bhi saaf dikhaai pad rahi he
 In particular, many former cricketers and fans are disappointed with the absence of Yuvraj Singh
 itnaa hi nahin team sellection ke baad se kai logon ko shaq he ki ye team world cap khitaab bachaa bhi paaegi yaa nahin!in 7 vajahon se yuvaraj rah gaye team se baahar'anfit' jadeja or 'betaa' binni team main kyon?bharat ne jab 2011 main world cap jeeta tha to us team main captain kool emes dhoni ke paas sachin tendulkar, yuvaraj singh, virendra sahvaag, jahir khan, harbhajan singh or gautam gambhir jaise anbhavi or nayab nagine maujuud the
 But this time Team India seems quite inexperienced compared to that team
 lekin is baat se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki is team main bhi kuch aise heere hai jo apni chakachaundh se virodhiyon ko chaunkaa sakate hai
 Let us know why there is a contender to win the Team India World Cup
 1
 Team India will have the strongest batting, Pancharatna
 daromdarteam India has always woken up to the opposing teams on its own batting
 is baar bhi team ko ballebaajon se zyada ummid rahegi
 Of course this time there are no Sachin, Veeru, Yuvraj or Gambhir, but Team India currently has the best batsman in the world, Virat Kohli, apart from this, ODI specialists like Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane and Suresh Raina strengthen India's chances
 Let's make
 agar dhoni ke saath in paanch ballebaajon kaa balla chal padaa to bharat kisi bhi lakshya ko hasil kar saktaa he
 2
 dhoni chale to kar denge anhoni ko honihar captain kii chahat hoti he ki vah apni team ko front se lead kare
 Dhoni has won his captaincy and batting iron all over the world
 is baar dhoni kii ballebaaji or leadership bhartiya team ke liye bahut kuch tay karegi
 If Dhoni's bat runs, then he can also happen to Anhoni and Team India can win the World Cup
 duniya ke sabase best finishr ke rup main mashhoor dhoni ko is world cap main bahut bada role nibhaana hoga
 Anyway, if Dhoni manages to win this World Cup, then his record of winning two consecutive World Cups will also be recorded
 isse pehle westeindies ke purv captain clive loyad (1975 or 1979) or australia ke riki ponting (2003 or 2007) lagaataar do world cap jitkar yah sammaan apane naam darj karvaa chuke hai
 Dhoni, who has added many achievements in front of his name, will do everything possible to achieve this achievement
 3
 In 1983, the all-rounders had won the World Cup to India, this time also did not expect in 1983 that India would win the World Cup, but the team's all-rounders did the charisma and crowned the World Cup on India's head for the first time
 kapil dev, mohinder amarnath, roger binni, ravi shastri or madan laal ke yogadanon ko aaj bhi bade garv se yaad kiya jaataa he
 In this World Cup too, India will once again expect amazing performance from their all-rounders
 rabindra jadeja, akshar patel, aar aswin or stuart binni se acchhee gendbaaji ke saath balle se bhi achche pradarshan kii ummid rahegi
 Raina and Rohit will also be expected to contribute with the ball
 umesh yadav, eshanth sharma or mohammad shami ko chhodkar team kaa har khilaadi olerounder najar aata he, jo team india kii daavedaari ko majboot karti he
 4
 australia kii condishan team india ke liye rahegi madadgaarhalia dinon main bharat ne australian pichon par jis tarah kii ballebaaji kii he usase ek ummid jarur jaag gai he ki bharat vahaan bhi acha khel saktaa he
 India will play most of their matches in Australia on a batting friendly pitch
 saath hi world cap australia ke gharelu toornament kaa sijan khatm hone ke baad khelaa janaa he, aise main australia ke pichon main wo teji or oochaal nahin rahegi
 If this happens then Team India can also raise their batting in Australia
 5
 Bowling is definitely weak but not ineffective Team India is considered to be the weakest bowling
 lekin vidambnaa yah bhi he ki bharat ke paas isse behatar bowler hai bhi nahin
 India have been bowling poorly in Test matches, but ODI cricket is a different game and in 50 overs the same bowlers will be seen changing
 mohammad shami, bhubaneshwar kumaar, eshanth sharma, umesh yadav, aar aswin, rabindra jadeja or akshar patel apni ausat se thodaa bhi behatar pradarshan kar paane main safal rahe to team india sabko chaunkaate hue ek baar phir world champion ban sakati he

 com / yi3matdshg— Congress (@incindia)april 3, 2018mahatvapurn he mathrajya ke sabhi 30 jilon main mathon kaa jaal failaa hua he
 The monasteries have their dominance and dominance in terms of caste equation, which attracts political parties towards them
 kanak gurupeeth pichde samudaay kaa sabase asardaar math mana jaataa he
 It is the monastery of the Qurba community
 kurba samudaay ke 80 se zyada math hai
 Its main monastery is the Srigaire monastery in Davanagere
 maujuuda mukhyamantri siddharmaiya isi samudaay se aate hai
 The Kurba population in the state is 8 percent
 yahi vajah he ki yahaan ke mukhya swami se mulaakaat hone or na hone ke bhi bade raajnneetik myne hai
 How much the monasteries influence Karnataka's politics can also be gauged from the visits of Rahul Gandhi and Amit Shah
 apane har daure main donon netaa reliyon ke saath-saath mathon ke daure karnaa nahin bhul rahe hai
 Accepting the demand of the Lingayat community, the Congress has played a big bet because the most influential monasteries in Karnataka belong to the Lingayat community
 aise main amit shah bhi obisi samudaay se jude mathon kaa daura kar unka samarthan hasil karne kii purajor koshish main jute hai

 Yesterday, British companies Vodafone's Indian unit Vodafone India and Aditya Birla Group company Idea Cellular announced the merger and gave the biggest news in the telecom sector
 donon companiyaan ek saath aakar bharat kii number 1 telecom company banakar ubhar sakati hai
 Due to this, their chances of staying in the benefit of their customers are being looked at
 reliance jeeyo ne telecom bazaar main aakar aisi pratispardhaa ko janm de diya he jisase pehle se paanv pasaare baithe telecom diggajon ko apane sar ke upar chat bachaane kii naubat aa padi
 Had it not been live, the story of this merger would not have happened
 ab chunki idia or vodaphone ek ho gayi ho to ab reliance jeeyo, airtel, idia-vodaphone samet chand companiyaan hi bachiin hai
 And according to previous reports, BSNL-MTNL is also going to be one
 aise main hamaari aashaa he ki galaa kaat pratiyagita ke badhane se graahakon ko phayda pahonchega
 HP-PVR will jointly launch Asia's first VR lounges in Noida Advantages: Can live with new offers After reversing the merger, both customers have become the most part of them by joining them
 jo jeeyo se bhi zyada hai, is vajah se jeeyo ko barabari kii takkar milegi
 But from the old antics of Jio, there is such a feeling that Jio will again give a new and powerful offer by reversing
 price warriliance jeeyo ne welcome ofer pesh kiya uske baad hapi new year ofer or colling hameshaa muft rakhane kaa vaada bhi kar diya
 These offers gave Price War a different level
 ab vodaphone or idia ek saath aa gayi hai saath hi reliance communication bhi bazaar main bane rahane ke har sambhav prayaas karegaa, aise main tay he ki price war kii is bhidnt main telecom services saste ho sakaten hai
 Better network Idea and Vodafone will be merged after merging the two companies, it is expected that customers will get better network connectivity
 1 april ke baad bhi free rahegi Jio kii ye sarvice, uthaaen phaaydadamdar ofrydia or vodaphone marjar ke baad donon companiyaan ek hokar kaam karegi, aise main mauka bhi he or dastur bhi
 The opportunity will be redeemed at all and populist plans may rain
 kya pataa inkaa hi koi welcome ofer aa jaae!sarvice quality sudharne kii he sambhaavnaaho saktaa he ki aapako aane vaale samay main kol drop or slo network jaisi pareshaaniyon kaa saamana na karnaa pade
 Because Vodafone and Idea will use each other's resources once they are together, this will reduce their cost and the two benefits of the technology will become double for the customers
 pratispardhaa yaheen nahin thamegikhbar he ki reliance communication, airsel, tata tele services or MTS milakar ek badi company bana sakati hai or bharti airtel ne pehle hi telenor kaa bhartiya bijness kharid liya he
 In such a situation, it can be said that the picture is still left, see what else comes out of the treasury of telecom companies for the customers

 Throughout the night, hundreds of bikers were roaming the streets

 khaskar sex ko lekar desh ke yuvak-yuvatiyon ke khyal ekadam badale-badale najar aa rahe hai
 During a recent survey, it was revealed that now the desire of virgin husband in girls is decreasing
 alag-alag shaharon main ladakiyon se ek sawaal kiya gaya
 The young women were asked if they would like a virgin husband? The answers that come to this question make many think
 kuch ladakiyon ne to saaf-saaf kaha ki ve aisa pati chaahati hai, jiske paas pehle se koi 'anubhav' na ho
 But the answers of many girls were quite shocking
 kisi ne kaha ki ve virgin hasband ke bare main nahin sochati hai, kyonki unhen acchhee tarah maaloom he ki aaj jamaana kis taraf ja rahaa he
 Everyone has patience to wait until marriage, as a result, sex before marriage is becoming common in big cities
 liv-in kaa chalan bhi dinondin badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Someone said that they do not care whether her future husband is a virgin or not
 kisi ne badi bebaaki se yah bhi kah daalaa ki chaahe ladkiyaan hon yaa ladke, donon hi apane bare main har tarah kaa faisla khud le rahe hai
 In such a situation, if an adult makes sexual relations with someone of their choice before marriage, then there is nothing wrong in this
 saath hi virginity shaadi ke liye koi shart nahin ho sakati
 An answer also came that neither a boy who has lost virginity should desire a virgin bride, nor a girl who has lost a virginity wants a virgin husband
 kul milakar, bhartiya samaaj ab us sawaal kaa saamana karne kii himmat dikhaa rahaa he, jisase ek dashak pehle tak vah nazren churaayaa karata tha
