 But the question is that in India, the exams for which students have spent a significant part of their life are worth when they leave as engineers
 kya ve vaaki ejeeniyar ban pate hai
 According to a recent report by Aspiring Mind, a company dealing with talent identification and research, less than 8% of Indian engineers are eligible to be employed in solid engineering roles in core areas

 Apart from bad engineers and more engineers, a challenge is that most engineers want to go into the IT sector
 basic ejineering kii taraf bahut kam jane vaale hote hai
 Rather, it is now being said that due to this shortage, the development of manufacturing sector is being hampered
 chaatro kii buniyadi samaj behad kamazor he
 Apart from engineering, it is also said that engineers are also very weak in social science

 Today, many engineers are forced to work between five and ten thousand after four years of study

 Earning money iti company main 14 ghante kaam karke saal ke saadhe teen lakh kamaane kii kya zarurat he jab aap car chalaakar saal main chah se saat lakh kama sakate hai
 Apart from bad engineers, more engineers, the question is whether the engineers who are becoming engineers are doing engineering work or doing something else

 Engineer's day is celebrated in his memory
 mysore ke visweswareyaa ne pune se ejineering kii padhai kii
 Krishnaraja Sagar Dam, Bhavati Iron and Steel Works, Mysore Sandal Oil and Soap Factory, University of Mysore were formed by the efforts of Visvesvaraya, also known as MVK
 unhen bharat ratna se bhi sammanit kiya ja chukaa he
 The comments ek jamaane main ejeeniyar bananaa badi baat thi, aaj ke jamaane main ejeeniyar na bananaa badi baat he
 Whoever has become engineering, sometimes works in finance, sometimes goes into film and sometimes becomes a good and bad writer
 ek sajjan ne twit kiya he ki ham ek aise desh main rahete hai jahaan pehle ham ejeeniyar banate hai phir uske baad faisla karte hai ki uske baad zindagi main kya karnaa he
 Happy All Engineers Day
 kya bharat ke ejeeniyar vaaki naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai
 If this is the case then who is it that is celebrating Visvesaraya's birthday? ejeeniyar banane ke naam par desh main arabon rupee kaa koching kaarobaar chal rahaa he, tanaav main bachche aatm hatya kar rahe hai lekin jab ban jate hai to zyaadaatar ejeeniyar hi nahin rahete
 a survey by NASSCOM in 2011 found that only 17
 5% ejineering graduate hi naukari ke laayak the
 NASSCOM is the short name of the National Association of Software and Services Companies
 iske survey ke mutabik 82
 5 percent of engineers were not found fit for the job
 bharat main kareeb saadhe teen hazaar ejineering kalege hai
 There are more than a thousand colleges in Tamil Nadu alone
 2015 ke aankade ke anusaar in collejon main 16 lakh sattar hazaar seat hai
 So is India producing bad engineers as well as excessive engineers
 desh main takneekee shiksha ko regulate karne vaala (AICTE) yani All India Council of Technical Education desh main under graduate ejineering siton ko agle kuch saal main 40% tak kam karnaa chahta he
 For this many colleges will have to be closed and the rest of the colleges will have to reduce the number of students
 AICTE ke chairman anil sahasrabuddhe ne kaha ki ham ejineering kii siton kii sankhya 16
 Want to reduce from 7 lakhs to between ten to eleven lakhs
 unhone yah baat 2015 main kahi thi jo ek akhbaar main chhapi thi
 If you are thinking that the quality of students of engineering colleges that have grown like cookery is poor, then it is not completely correct
 The National Employability Report ne desh bhar main qareeb dedh lakh ejiniyaron par aadhaarit sample ke aadhaar par vishleshan kiya he
 It is learned that there is a severe shortage of skills in these engineers
 ek maikenical dizine ejeeniyar ke liye 5
 Only 55 percent are eligible
 civil ejeeniyar ke liye sirf 6
 Only 48% are eligible
 chemical dizine ejeeniyar ke kaam ke liye sabase kam 1
 Only 64% of engineers are qualified
 electronic ejeeniyar ke role ke liye 7
 Only 07% of engineers are able to prove themselves
 karaab ejeeniyar or adhik ejeeniyar ke alaava ek chunauti yah bhi he ki zyaadaatar ejeeniyar iti sector main janaa chaahate hai
 Very few are going towards basic engineering
 balki ab yah kaha ja rahaa he ki is kami ke kaaran manuphaccharing sector ke vikaas main baadha aa rahi he
 Basic understanding of students is very weak
 ejineering ke alaava yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki ejeeniyar samaaj vigyaan ke maamle main bhi kaaphi kamazor hai
 In the last 15 years, the enrollment of students in engineering has increased five-fold while the jobs have decreased by 10%
 aaj bahut se ejeeniyar chaar saal kii padhai ke baad paanch se das hazaar ke bich naukari karne par majaboor hai
 When the Patel agitation broke out in Gujarat, there was a complaint from the students that after selling land and enrolled in engineering, they got a job of five thousand
 kuch hafte pehle mohan das pai kaa ek bayaan pitiai ke hawaale se chapa tha ki aaj kaa bi tech dasvin paas ke baraabar he
 Most engineers Ola and Uber from poor colleges are only eligible for taxis
 main mazaaq nahin kar rahaa hum
 In Bangalore, many software engineers quit their jobs and are driving Ola and Uber cars
 paisa kama rahe hai
 What is the need to earn three and a half lakhs a year by working 14 hours in an IT company when you can earn six to seven lakhs a year by driving a car
 karaab ejeeniyar, zyaada ejeeniyar ke alaava sawaal he ki jo ejeeniyar ban rahe hai kya ve ejineering kaa kaam kar rahe hai yaa kuch or kar rahe hai
 In the coming days, it is announced to open an IT college, but with that news comes that many colleges in the state have not even filled seats
 aaj ejeeniyar diwas he

 beete 15 saalon main ejineering main chaatro kaa daakhila paanch guna badha he jabaki naukariyaan 10% kam hui hai
 Today, many engineers are forced to work between five and ten thousand after four years of study
 gujarat main jab patel andolan bhadkaa tha tab chaatro kii ek shikaayat yah bhi thi ki zamin bech kar ejineering main daalila liya magar naukari mili paanch hazaar kii
 a few weeks ago a statement from Mohan Das Pai was quoted as saying that today's b Tech is equivalent to tenth pass
 karaab collejon se nikle zyaadaatar ejeeniyar ola or ubar taxi ke liye hi laayak hai
 I'm not joking bengaluru main kai software ejeeniyar naukari chhod kar ola or ubar car chalaa rahe hai
 Earning money iti company main 14 ghante kaam karke saal ke saadhe teen lakh kamaane kii kya zarurat he jab aap car chalaakar saal main chah se saat lakh kama sakate hai
 Apart from bad engineers, more engineers, the question is whether the engineers who are becoming engineers are doing engineering work or doing something else
 aae din kahin na kahin iti college kholane kaa elaan ho jaataa he, lekin usee ke saath khabar aa jaati hai ki phalane rajya ke kai collejon main seat bhi nahin bhari

 saath hi unhone yah bhi saaf kar diya ki waisi surat main ve khud kahin se chunaav nahin ladenge

 unhone yah bhi kaha ki is toornament main viraat kohli saare record tod denge
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Abbas said, 'I want the cricket match between India and Pakistan to be very difficult

 notebandi ke baad se bainkon ke baahar lagi lambii-lambii kataren to sabko dikh rahi hai, lekin ek varg aisa bhi he, jis par kisi kaa dhyaan nahin gaya
 This class is for those truckers who come to Delhi with goods every day, but since demonetisation, they have to pay green tax with open money every day, otherwise the truck has to stand on toll points for hours
 sabase badi samasya un trek driveron ke saamne hai, jinako unke maalik hajaar rupee kharche ke liye de rahe hai, lekin jab wo dilli kii seemaa main daakhil hote hai to green tex dete vakt toll karmchaaree unase hajaar rupee ke note lene se manaa kar dete hai
 Actually, the MCD has not been charging toll since demonetisation, but the order of the court is being taken on the tax
 bataur green tex dilli aane vaale trakon ko ek raashi jamaa karaani hoti he jo 700, 1300, 1400 or 2600 rupaye he
 Although MCD is accepting old Rs 500 notes for green tax, the problem comes when truck drivers need 100 notes
 halaat ye hai ki 100 rupee ke note ke liye kai baar trek driveron ko lambey vakt tak intjaar karaayaa jaataa he, jiske kaaran vakt par wo saamaan kii delivery nahin de paa rahe
 On the one hand, while the corporation has received a significant amount of property taxes through demonetisation, there is a loss of Rs 27 crore due to non-collection of toll tax
 iske alaava notebandi ke baad se ab tak lagbhag 18 karod 66 lakh rupee kaa green tex liya ja chukaa he, lekin isamen se nigam ko koi raashi nahin mili, jiske liye emsidi court kaa darwaja khatkhata sakati he

 Here, Yamraj should also stay for a moment
 dayaanidhi maaran chennai ke nangambakkam ilaake main 2001 tak jis discothe ke maalik the, uske bare main yahi kaha karte the
 As far as the encounter with the former Union Telecom Minister and his brother in law is concerned, the shadows of Yamraj may not have become dense yet, but it will soon start showing clearly
 48 varshiya dayaanidhi ko unke nafis paridhaanon or shandaar kaaron se muhabbat ke liye janaa jaataa he
 He and his businessman brother, 50-year-old Kalanidhi, will have to make rounds of courts for some time to come as the CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED) are preparing to put them in the dock in two politically sensitive cases
 inamen se ek maamle main maaran bandhuon par aarope he ki dayaanidhi ne bataur doorsanchaar mantri apni haisiyat kaa beja phayda uthaakar singapore main based si
 Shivshankar was forced to sell his company Aircel to Maxis and in return took a bribe from Maxis
 mexis samooh kii company estro ol asia netvaks ne maaran bandhuon ke san samooh main 629 karod ru
 Invested and gave shares to Kalanidhi and his wife
 1 april ko idi ne maaran parivaar kii 742 karod ru
 Confiscated the property of aarope yah he ki yah sampatti airsel-mexis saude se rishwat ke rup main hasil kii gai thim
 Dayanidhi says that Aircel was about to sell anyway
 idi kii karrwai se maaran bandhuon kii aarthik haisiyat ko shaayad zyada chot nahin pahonchegi, haalanki agle hi din san samooh ke share 13 fisadi gir gaye
 Kalanidhi is one of Asia's most successful media owners
 fobrurs ke mutabik ve 27wein sabase amir bhartiya hai, jinaki kul sampatti 2
 7 billion dollars, while last year they 2
 3 arab dollar sampatti ke saath 38wein sabase amir bhartiya the
 But like his younger brother, Kalanidhi did not get into politics
 diemke supremeo em
 Karunanidhi, whose nephew is the son of Mursoli Maran, offered him to contest the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, which he refused
 unke badale dayaanidhi ko tikat diya gaya or ve jitkar doorsanchaar mantri ban gaye
 The second case against the Maran brothers is the unlawful use of bsnl's telephone exchange, in which Sun Group used more than 300 expensive ISDN lines for free
 ye line beasenel ke mahaprabandhak ke naam se registerd thim, lekin inke jariye chennai main dayaanidhi ke vishaal ghar ko san tivi ke daftar se jod diya gaya or iske liye khaas taur par bhumigat taar bichhaae gaye
 a large number of data were sent from these lines and thus facilitated faster transmission of TV programs across the world
 pichley saal janvari main sibiai ne maaran bandhuon ke teen sahyogiyon ko giraftaar kiya tha, jinamein dayaanidhi kaa ek nijee sahaayak or san samooh ke adhikari shaamil the
 Dayanidhi says that this case is also the result of political conspiracy
 maaran bandhu isse pehle bhi sankaton se ghire hai or usee tarah unase batch bhi nikle hai
 In 2007, his Dinakaran newspaper published a survey which claimed that DMK activists m as an heir to Karunanidhi
 ke
 Is supported by Stalin, his brother M
 ke
 Not of Alagiri
 iske natijatan party ke bheetar bheeshan ladaai chhid gai or alaagiri ke samarthakon ne madurai main akhbaar ke daftar main aag laga di, jisamen teen karmi maare gaye
 Angered Karunanidhi expelled Dayanidhi from the DMK and forced him to resign as Union Minister
 lekin maaran bandhuon ko parivaar or party ke pitamah kii meharbaani dobaaraa hasil karne main zyada vakt nahin laga; dayaanidhi ko 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main maidan main utaara gaya or jaldi hi ve kendriya kapadaa mantri ban gaye
 However, if the courts do not relieve them this time, the Maran brothers may be in a much bigger crisis than they anticipated
 un par chal rahe mukademon kii vajah se unka vah rajnatik dabadabaa khatm ho saktaa he, jiske dam par unka kai arab dollar kaa media samrajya phala-phula he
 In fact, the Maran brothers' empire is the result of a clever combination of political power and merciless business intelligence
 apni sthapana ke dedh dashak baad aaj san samooh ke paas tamil, malayalam, kannada or telegu ke 33 tivi channel hai or ye koi 10 karod gharon main pahunchate hai
 The group also owns Sun Direct, one of the country's most successful direct-to-home broadcasting companies, with 45 radio FM channels and three major Tamil newspapers and six magazines owned by it
 apane duusare niveshon main se zyaadaatar main maaran bandhuon ne mitti se paisa banaaya he, jinamein indian premier lig (ipiel) kii frenchiji hyderabad sunrisers bhi shaamil he
 The only disappointing investment is probably loss-making airline spicejet, in which they had to sell all their shares, in addition to 10 per cent, in January for undisclosed funds
 yah koi raaj kii baat nahin he ki maaran bandhuon kii shandaar tarakkee sidhe diemke kii takadir se judi rahi he
 DMK is the only party which has continuously shared power at the Center from 1996 to 2014
 or yahi maaran bandhuon ke liye sabase zyada pareshaani kii baat ho sakati he
 The DMK remains a shadow of its past after an unprecedented defeat in the 2015 Lok Sabha elections
 alaagiri or stallin ke bich lambey samay se chali aa rahi ladaai kii vajah se party sanghathan taar-taar ho chukaa he
 The verdict of 2G spectrum scams is going to come in the next few months and if he is the daughter of Karunanidhi Kanimozhi and DMK leader and former Telecom Minister A
K
 raja ke khilaaf jaataa he, to party ke liye kai barason tak isse ubar paanaa mushkil hoga
 The party is now in such a bad state that J
 after being sentenced in September on a disproportionate assets case
 jayalalita ko jab majaboor hokar istipha dena padaa, to tamilnadu kii raajnneeti main achaanak paidaa hue khalipan ko bharne ke liye party mushkil se hi haath-pair maar saki; or aisa is hakeekat ke baavjood hua ki eiediemke ke paas jayalalita kii khaali jagah ko bharne ke liye duusari paaydaan kaa koi majboot netaa nahin he
 Sources reveal that the DMK has decided to go under pressure at the moment
 haalanki idi ke sampatti jabt karne ke fouran baad dayaanidhi bagaiyr vakt ganvaae stallin se milane gaye
 a senior DMK leader in Chennai admits that the 2G scam and Maran lawsuits have weakened the party and the party is not as comfortable as it should be
 ve kehete hai, vidhansabha chunaav ek saal dur rah gaye hai or is vakt party jitani kamjor he, usase zyada kamjor hone kaa koi tarika uske paas nahin he
 "he has no support base of his own to support Dayanidhi, which means that he and his brother will have to deal with the current crisis without their well-known and family safeguard
 aisa karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 PMK leader s
 ramdaas pehle hi kaabil vipakshi netaa ke taur par apni haisiyat majboot karne main jute gaye hai
 They know that the clouds hovering over the Maran brothers have pushed the DMK into an even deeper swamp
 ramdaas kii party ko pichley loksabhaa chunaav main 5 fisadi se kam vot mili the
 Recently he made the Governor K
 rosaiya ko bhrashtachar main jabardast badhotaree ke khilaaf ek gyaapan saunpa he
 On the other hand, Dayanidhi insists that he is being implicated in these matters to please someone
 ve kehete hai, "idi ne sampatti jabt karne main itani jaldbaaji kii, yah is baat kaa saboot he ki koi is sabake peeche he
 "they further say," the law states that only property purchased with unlawful sums can be confiscated
 march 2007 main main kendriya doorsanchaar mantri ke pad se hat gaya, or kaha gaya he ki estro ol asia network ne us saal ke aakhir main san diarect main nivesh kiya
 Apart from this, the deal was approved by the central government and i have nothing to do with Sun Direct
 main kanoonee ladaai laduunga
 "this fight will be long and difficult, because there is so much at stake - both for the Maran brothers and also for the politics of Tamil Nadu
 notebandi kii aankadon vaali sachai kaa khulaasa kendrieriserv bankne beete hafte apni vaarshik report ke jariye karte hue desh kii sava sau karod se adhik janata ko bataa diya he ki 99
 3% of banned currency has reached banks
 lekin yah khulaasa abhi bhinotebandika report card taiyaar karne ke liye paryaapt nahin he
 India Today Hindi editor Anshuman Tiwari claims that to decide whether demonetisation has passed or failed, it is now very important that the central government bring its figures in front of the country to answer five such questions and the last one standing in the queue of demonetisation Citizen could know whether demonetisation has passed or failed? Investigation of Jan Dhan? Demonetisation was announced on 8 November 2016 and the fact that the country is alert in just 15 days Amne was being done to avoid the outbreak of Notbandi using Jan Dhan accounts of the central government
 is tathy ke aate hi kendriya rigerv bank ne jandhan khaaton main jamaa karne kii seemaa 50,000 rupee nirdhaarit kar di or khaaton main jamaa ho rahe behisaab nakadi par jaanch baitha di gai
 Read this: BJP stopped the report of the demonetisation 'truth' in the Parliamentary Committee? Significantly, after demonetisation, the number of Jan Dhan accounts increased
 kul jandhan khaaton kaa 80 fisadi khaataa kendra sarkaar ke bainkon main he
 In the first month after demonetisation, the total deposits in these accounts jumped from 456 billion to 746 billion
 kya ab in khaaton kii jaanch report janata ke saamne laane kii jarurat nahin he?sarkari vibhaagon kii notebadali?notebandi ke elaan ke baad kendra sarkaar, rajya sarkaar or deshbhar main sarkari companiyon par notebandi ke pratibandh kaam nahin kar rahe the
 At the same time, many government services were also allowed to take cash during the demonetization phase
 sarkari companiyon ke paas badi maatra main kaarobaari nakadi maujuud rahati he or unki yah lenden gaiyrsarkari upakramon se hoti he
 At the same time, there are many government departments which are the leading department in accepting cash to collect revenue every day
 kya desh ko ab yah pataa nahin chalanaa chahie ki notebandi ke dauraan sarkari vibhaagon or companiyon main nakadi kaa sanchaar kis tarah rahaa or in vibhaagon ke jariye sarkari khajaanon main kitni pratibandhit karency waapas lauti he?corporate khaaton kii notebandinotbandi ke elaan ke baad desh kii badi-badi companiyon or bade kaarobaariyon ne apane kaarobaari khaaton (curent acount) ke jariye kitni badi sankhya main pratibandhit karency ko bank main pahunchane kaa kaam kiya he
 It is worth noting that the purpose of the current account (current account) of millions of open traders in banks is to make provision for taking and giving cash for business ease
 kaarobaariyon ko mili is suvidha kaa notebandi ke daur main kaisaa istemaal kiya gaya kii koi sateek jaankaree sarkaar athwa bainkon ke jariye nahin kii gai he
 However, the Central Government, after demonetisation, disclosed a large number of shell companies citing several investigations
 sarkaar ne yah bhi mana ki in shell companiyon ke jariye badi maatra main maninondering kii ja rahi thi
 So now the country has to wait to see the actual figure of the game of returning the cash from the accounts of the traders to the banks
 raajnneetik dalon kii lendendesh main kaledhan or bhrashtachar par lagaam lagane ke liye bani abtak ke sabhi aayogon kaa maananaa he ki is samasya ke kendra main raajnneetik dalon kii ahm bhoomika rahati he
 On the other hand, the most surprising fact after the announcement of demonetisation is that during this period, no restrictions were imposed on the political parties of the country
 vahiin notebandi ke baad kuch afvaahon ko dur karne ke liye kendra sarkaar ne saaf elaan kiya tha ki raajnneetik dalon ke khaaton kii kisi tarah kii koi jaanch nahin kii jaaegi
 Read this: These 10 benefits were expected from demonetisation, these 5 losses are done, in such a situation, to prepare the report of demonetization, is it not necessary that the country should know that their political parties have banned the huge amount of currency in the bank Delivered and got a new currency in return
 bainkon kii balanceshit?notebandi kii prakriya jis ek sanstha ke sahare chalaai gai vah he desh ke darjanon sarkari bank, nijee bank kooparative bank ityadi
 During the process, questions were raised on the entities that the RBI, including these banks, were responsible for depositing the banned currency and communicating the new currency
 ye sawaal itane gambhir the ki in bainkon ke kuch karmchaariyon samet bainkon ke niamak rigerv bank ke kuch adhikariyon ke khilaaf kadam uthaae gaye
 But till now, the investigation report of the balance sheet of the banks has not been submitted to the people, to reveal what role they have played in this more serious step against Kaledhal and corruption
 ye paanch sawaal sarkaar kii aalochana ke liye nahin balki nagarikon ke us moulik adhikaar ke liye he jisaki raksha karne kaa daayitv samay-samay par naagarik nai-nai sarkaron ko dete hai

 New news is now coming in between the support of opposition camps in the name of Ramnath Kovind for the presidency
 sutron ke raashtrapati pad ke liye congress kii pehali pasand harith kranti ke janak em
 S
 Swaminathan
 darasal, bijepi ke dalit card ke saamne congress kisaan card khelnaa chaahati he
 It is being told that the Congress will contact Swaminathan soon after discussing with the other opposition parties
 sutron ke mutabik, congress kisi rajaneta ke bajaay pratishthit or sammanit chehre ko raashtrapati ummidavaar ke rup main pesh karnaa chaahati he
 At the same time, the Congress is also expected to join the Shiv Sena in the name of Swaminathan
 aise main bijepi-shivasena ke bich chal rahi talkhi ko bhi bhavishya main bhunaane kii koshish kii ja sakati he
 Gopal Krishna Gandhi is the second choice of Congress after Swaminathan
 congress kaa maananaa he ki jaise pratibha singh patil ke khilaaf bijepi bhenro singh shekhavat ko ladaakar mahila virdohi nahin hui, vaise hi dalit kovind ke khilaaf kisi anya ko ladaane se wo dalit virdohi nahin ho jaaegi
 It is also known that Dalit leader Meera Kumar can be made a candidate if opposition camps are absent
 samuhik hoga antim faislahalanki, kisi bhi naam par congress akele faisla nahin legi
 a final decision will be taken only after talks with the rest of the non-nda parties
 congress maanati he ki ankaganit puri tarah bijepi ummidavaar ke haq main he, isliye vipaksh kaa ummidavaar vichaardhaara kaa pratik maatr hoga or vipakshi ekta 2019 ke aam chunaav main kaam aegi
 The Congress also fears that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar may support Ramnath Kovind, as Kovind is currently the Governor of Bihar
 haalanki, party ye maanati he ki wo sirf lalu yadav par check rakhane ke liye or bihar ke rajyapal hone ke chalate hi samarthan kar sakate hai
 The Congress is confident that Nitish will not support the NDA
 agar ramnath kovind ke saamne congress samet duusare vipakshi dal apana sanyukt ummidavaar utaar bhi dete hai, to jeet mumkin nahin he
 This can definitely lead to opposition
 aise main congress shivasena ko endie se is chunaav main todane ke liye swaminathan kaa naam laana chaahati he
 Please tell that it was Shiv Sena who first suggested the name of Swaminathan
 bihar main loksabhaa chunaav ke liye seat bantwaare par bijepi or jediu ke bich sahmati kii muhar lag chuki he
 However, people did not get to hear the figures that they were waiting for, that is, how many seats will the four NDA partners contest in Bihar
 shuukravaar ko dilli main shaam ko media ke samanenithish kumarathramit shahamuskuraate pesh hue
 In a very short meeting, Amit Shah said that BJP and JDU will contest on equal seats in Bihar
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki is vakt ramvilas paswan auraupendra kushvahabhi endie main hai or unhen sammanjanak siten di jaaegin
 CM Nitish Kumar also repeated almost the same statement
 jab in netaaon se patrakaron ne siton ke ganit par poocha to donon hi netaaon ne kaha ki do-teen din main isaki ghoshnaa kii jaaegi
 Here, the seat-sharing screw gets stuck again
 sawaal yah he ki agar bihar endie ke sabhi dalon main sahmati thi to siton kii sahi sankhya kaa elaan shuukravaar ko kyon nahin hua? sutron ke mutabik araspi auralgepike hisse main jitani siten aa rahi hai, isse ye donon hi dal naakhush hai
 So seats have not been announced yet
 mana ja rahaa he siton kii antim ghoshnaa se pehle do se teen round baithak or hogi
 Meanwhile, the seats given by shah-nitish to RLSP-LJP are being indicated in the signs
 media reports ke mutabik ek vikalp yah he ki jediu or bijepi 16-16 siton par chunaav laden, jabaki algepi ko 6 or araspi ko 2 siten mil sakati hai
 The second option can be implemented when RLSP leaves the NDA
 is haalat main donon partiyaan 17-17 siton par chunaav ladegin or 6 siten algepi ko di jaaengi
 Explain that LJP won 6 seats in 2014, while RLSP won 3 seats
 araspi kaa teen se kam siton par raji ho paanaa mushkil sa lagata he
 Explain that when Amit Shah and Nitish Kumar were telling the media about their deal in Delhi, at the same time, Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha was meeting former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Tejashwi Yadav in Arwal, Bihar
 haalanki unhone is mulaakaat ko mahaj sanyog bataaya or kaha ki ve abhi bhi endie main hai or modi ko phir se piem banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 At the same time, Tejaswi said that Upendra Kushwaha is being insulted in the NDA
 bihar main loksabhaa kii 40 siten hai
 In the last Lok Sabha election, NDA was successful on 31 out of 40 seats, in which 22 seats were contested by BJP, JDU alone contested only 2 seats

 The Tibetan exiled government on Friday defended Karmapa's allegation of being a Chinese agent, stating that he held 100 percent faith in the Tibetan religious leader, the Dalai Lama
 karmapa ke math se haal main baari maatra main videshi mudra baraamad hui thi
 The Prime Minister of Tibet's exiled government, Samdhong Rinpoche, said that the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan community knew from the beginning that he was not a Chinese agent and called the entire dispute a verdict given by the media without hearing it
 bhartiya patrakaron ke ek samooh se baatcheet main rinpoche ne kaha, aadarneey dalai lamas kii karmapa main 100 pratishat aasthaa he
 He is not a Chinese agent
 ham shuruuaat se hi jaanate hai
 The Government of India has allowed them to go anywhere in the whole of India except two monasteries for some reason from the beginning
 rinpoche ne kaha ki karmapa ugyen trinle dorji ek mukt vyakti hai or unka un vittiya aniyamittaaon se koi lenaa dena nahin he jo puure vivaad kaa kaaran thi
 The Tibetan Prime Minister said, Karmapa is a person and was not involved in any financial transactions in his monastery
 aisa lagata he ki unke jo karmchaaree giraftaar kiye gayi hai, ve isamen shaamil the
 To some extent only we can bear
 yah media dwaara bina sunwaayee ke nirnay diye jane kaa maamla he
 He said that the country's law will take its own action against those involved

 Those arrested in this regard include Shakti Lama, accountant of Karmapa, KP Bhardwaj, a Dharamshala businessman and DK Dhar, manager of Corporation Bank
 police kaa maananaa he ki karmapa ke asthaayee ghar se baraamad hui vishaal dhanrashi ek jameen saude ke liye thi or bharadwaj tathaa dhar is samjhaute main madad kar rahe the
 Some reports said that the intelligence agencies suspected that Karamapa was a Chinese agent because a large amount of Chinese currency Yuan was recovered from his monastery

 The distance from Wassepur is not much from where the shootout took place

 Whereas in reality so many bullets were fired that for some time, the chance-e-incident had completely smoked
 goliyon ke khokhon se nikalne vaale dhuen se
 a small locality of Dhanbad is named Wasseypur
 is par film gangs of vasepur bani thi
 Just a few kilometers away from this is the home of Dawn, Cuckoo King and Bahubali Suraj Dev Singh
 kehete hai ki suraj dev singh ke ird-gird hi gangs of vasepur kii kahani buni gai thi
 In front of the house of the same Suraj Dev Singh, four murderers of the fare fired fifty rounds of bullets for about ten minutes

 goliyon kii aawaaj se gunj uthaa sheharpura kaa puraa ilaaka kareeb 10 minute tak goliyon kii awaz se goonjata rahaa
 How well the murderer came for Neeraj Singh's murder can only be gauged from the fact that he not only chose the speed breaker place for the murder, but also targeted the driver before killing Neeraj, so that he Could not run away with the car
 iske baad niraj ko 17 goliyaan maarin
 His friends were also shot

 " The Vishwa Hindu Parishad on Love Jihad says that the secular fraternity has objected to the literature related to Love Jihad distributed by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad at the spiritual fair in Jaipur

 Vishwa Hindu Parishad General Secretary Surendra Jain has said that today the whole world is expressing concern over the conspiracy of love jihad

 He asked, 'why do only Hindu girls marry Muslim boys? Why do not Muslim girls belong to Hindu boys? Why only Hindu girls convert after such marriage, why not Muslim boys? After such a marriage, why not find many girls even after finding them? ”surendra Jain says that after Kerala Karnataka, thousands of such examples have come out all over the country

 ladakh main kai varshon se jihadiyon ke dwaara chal rahe is shadyantr ko ab charam seemaa par pahunchaaya ja chukaa he
 Hence, some Buddhists also beat up some jihadis in the past
 padosi desh srilanka main bhi isi kaaran muslimon or baudhon main jhadpon ke samachar aa rahe hai
 The incidents of love jihad were also at the core of the conflict with the Rohingyas in Myanmar
 ab samay aa gaya he kii is shadyantr kosecularism kii aadamen chhipaane kii jagah ujagar kiya jaae or gaiyr muslimon ko saavdhaan kiya jaae
 Everyone should learn a lesson from the example of Kashmir

 It has started in Ladakh and Sri Lanka
 jihadiyon ke paapon ko secular birdari kitna bhi chupa le peedit samaaj ek seemaa ke baad pratikaar karegaa hi

 Confirming Rahul's visit, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh told a news channel that Rahul reached bhatta-parsaul village on Wednesday morning without telling anyone and he met the agitating farmers
 rahul gandhi motor cycle par savaar hokar kis raste se yahaan pahunche kisi ko is baat kii khabar nahin lagi
 Nobody recognized Rahul until he reached bhatta-parsaul as he rode on a bike
 digvijay ne kaha ki rahul kaa yah daura kisaanon se unke lagaav kaa udhaaharan he
 Accusing the Mayawati government, Singh said that Mayawati is giving compensation of Rs 500 per square meter to the farmers, while she herself is unjustly collecting donations of 3,000 square meters in lieu of land acquisition
 unhone kaha ki greater noida ke paas hi haryana main bhi jameen adhigrahan hota he lekin vahaan koi pareshaani nahin hoti or uttar pradesh main jab bhi jameen adhigrahan hota he tab isi tarah kisaanon kaa galaa ghonta jaataa he
 He said that it is not development to strangle the farmers and exploit the industrialists
 digvijay ne kaha ki noida main jameenon kaa jo ghotaalaa ho rahaa he vah 2-ji ghotaale se kam se kam teen guna bada he
 He said that since the end of Congress rule in Uttar Pradesh, in the last twenty years Uttar Pradesh has been dominated by casteism, division in the name of religion, corruption and misrule
 uttar pradesh sarkaar puri tarah se asamvedansheel he or yahi samasya kii jad he

 Ignoring the passenger safety issue, he said, "the other problem people face is the interior of the train
 ab ham nae dibbe lekar aa rahe hai, jisase logon kii pareshaani dur ho jaaegi or ve aisa mahasoos karenge jaise hawaii jahaaj main safar kar rahe hon

 When the first attack took place on April 30, many people arrived there to help the injured
 lekin tabhi vahaan doosraa dhamaakaa ho gaya
 Significantly, in the last 1 month, there have been a total of 6 attacks in Afghanistan
 kuch hafte pehle hi kabul main hue bam dhamaake main 60 logon kii maut ho gai thi or 129 log ghayal hue the
 Militant Syed Abdul Karim Tunda had a pip in his mind
 ek kya, kai ranj the
 The carpenter from Pilkhua in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, witnessed several riots in Ahmedabad and Mumbai in the early eighties and saw one of his relatives and three other Muslims being burnt alive before his eyes
 kaha jaataa he ki shaayad us samay umr ke tisare dashak ke aakhri varshon main chal rahe is shaks ko inhen ghatnaon ne had paar karne ke liye uksaaya
 He decided that he would avenge this injustice
 usnejehad karne kii thaanee
 In this regard, he learned Arabic, initiated Muslim youths into bigotry and conducted many experiments to make bombs
 haalanki use takreeban ek dashak tak intjaar karnaa padaa or tab jaakar vah lashkar-e-tayba se jud paaya or is tarah aatank kii sangathit duniya kaa hissaa ban gaya
 Some Muslim youths from Kolkata, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, boiling over the communal riots in Gujarat in 2002 and caught up with the old anger within, decided to commit violence in retaliation
 inhen kaa gut baad menindian mujahidin (iem) ke naam se janaa gaya
 Almost similar story is of Shah Mudassar and Ahmed Khan of Maharashtra
 kehete hai ki ye donon soshal netwarking par kai aaidi ke saath sakriy the or bharat main kathith taur se islamic rajya kii sthapana karnaa chaahate the
 Coincidentally, the Hyderabad Police came to know of their plans and were caught

 If needed, these youngsters do not hesitate to fly to the world's most dangerous terrorist targets Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and Syria so that they can get the skills that they need
 suraksha agenciyon or aatank ke jaankaron ne inke kai naam rakhe hai jinamein “aaazaad aatanki” (lone woolf / vulvj) sarvaadhik prachlit hua he
 Professor Azim Ibrahim, Research Fellow of the International Security Program at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, wrote in 2008, "the implications of Israeli terrorism are very deep
 ” yah vah samay tha jab pashchimi deshon ko is chalan kii bhanak laganaa shuru hi hui thi
 He writes, "freelance terrorists can easily cross borders, join and disintegrate as they wish, and coordination between them can be done remotely
" aise kattarpanthi jaruri nahin he ki aapas main kabhi mili hon lekin ve online apni preranaayen, yojanaayen aadi saz kar sakate hai
 The decisive difference is that any terrorist can be replaced by another terrorist
 yani kisi bhi aatankwaadi gut kaa nirnaayak taur se khaatmaa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 'who terrorists Another similarity about which all security agencies and counterterrorism experts agree is about the difference that technology has brought

 This is to the extent that security officials are now calling technology a new weapon for terrorists

 Over time, if technology is helping to shape the ambitions of the radical youth, then the factory of terror is also becoming state-of-the-art

 haalanki bhatkal ne in donon ko afghanistan or pakistan kii seemaa par baraamachaa naam ke kasbe main prashikshan shiviron main bheja tha
 Faheem had told the investigators that he was not given free live cartridges as per what he was told, which also disappointed him

 In fact, while launching the Nirmal Bharat Yatra under the Cleanliness Campaign in April last year, Jairam Ramesh said that 64 percent of the country's population is still forced to defecate in the open, so the country needs more toilets than temples
 ise bijepi ne hindu dharm or aasthaa par chot qaraar diya tha
 Ramesh was strongly criticized by BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy
 dharmik bhaavana ko dekh congress ne bhi ramesh se kinaaraa karte hue unhen khud bachaav karne main sakasham bataaya tha
 Then Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari had said that the Congress believes in Sarvadharma Sambhav and Ramesh himself will explain his statement
 lekin dilli main yuvaaon ke ek kaarykram main modi ne saaf taur par kaha ki unhen hindutvvaadi netaa ke taur par janaa jaataa he or unki chhavi aisa kehane kii ijaajat nahin detii
 But he thinks that there should be toilets in the country first, then a temple
 modi kii is tippanee ko bijepi netaa balbir punj swatchta ke liye acchhee pahal qaraar de rahe hai, to bihar ke purv upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne bhi twit kar saraahna kii
 He told it to follow the path of Swami Vivekananda and also reminded that 40 years ago Lohia had raised this issue in Parliament
 log un par hans rahe the or angreji media ne lohia kaa majaak banaaya tha
 Punj described Modi's initiative as honest, Jairam Ramesh's statement political
 lekin sawaal he ki bijepi ko swatchta kii yaad jairam ramesh ke bayaan ke vakt kyon nahin ai? jairam ramesh to aaj bhi apane us bayaan par date hue hai or modi ke bayaan ko chhavi badalane ke liye majaburi main diya rajnatik bayaan bataa rahe hai
 Ramesh has now also reminded old criticism from BJP leaders Rudy and Javadekar
 ramesh ne kaha he ki tab bijepi-sangh ke kaaryakarta unke ghar tak pahunche the or botalon main peshaab kar vahaan phenk gaye the
 Former South African fast bowler Alan Donald may join New Zealand as a bowling consultant as the board has confirmed that he is in talks with the 44-year-old Donald for a new role

 District Excise Officer Devraj Singh told PTI that since November 9, there has been a decrease of nearly forty percent in the sale of liquor
 aam dinon main kanpur shahar main roj kareeb 21 hajaar bottle angreji sharaab, 40 hajaar bottle bear tathaa kareeb 35 hajaar litre deshi sharaab kii bikri hoti thi
 In this way, we used to sell around seven lakh bottles of English liquor, about 1
2 million bottles of beer and about 1
5 million liters of country liquor every month
 yah aankade kisi maheene kam ho jate the to kisi tyohaar yaa shaadi aadi ke sijan main bad jate the
 He said that since the old notes were banned, liquor shops have been in silence and liquor sales have decreased by about 40 percent
 jab sharaab kii bikri kam hogi to sarkaar ko rajasav bhi kam milegaa, kyonki naye note se abhi sharaab kharidne waalon kii sankhya bahut hi kam he or puraane note na lene ke nirdesh sabhi sharaab kii dukaanon par de die gaye hai
 According to Excise Officer Devraj Singh, it will take about a month for the sale of liquor to become normal, because from where people will buy liquor when people do not have new notes
 vah kehete he ki isse aabkaari vibhaag ko rajasav kii kaaphi haani sahani padegi
 According to liquor dealer Dharmendra Jaiswal, nowadays it is the season of weddings and people used to buy more liquor in this season, but in this new note, there is no big order of liquor, where people would take 20 to 25 bottles of liquor at the wedding
 They were now operating only in two to three bottles
 isse sharaab vyapaariyon ko to baari nuksaan ho hi rahaa he kyonki unhone shaadiyon ke sijan ko dhyaan main rakhte hue baari maatra main sharaab kaa stock dukaanon main laga liya tha lekin ab bikri bahut hi kam ho gai he
 He says from where the government will get revenue when there is no sale

 Can't muster the courage to go to the liquor shops
 jila aabkaari adhikari devraj singh ne pitiai ko bataaya ki nau november se sharaab kii bikri main kareeb chalis fisadi kii kami he
 In general, about 21 thousand bottles of English liquor, 40 thousand bottles of beer and about 35 thousand liters of country liquor were sold daily in Kanpur city
 is tarah ham prati maheene ausatan kareeb saat lakh bottle angreji sharaab, kareeb 12 lakh bottle bear or kareeb 15 lakh litre deshi sharaab kii bikri karte the
 If this figure was reduced in a month, then it would increase in the season of any festival or wedding etc
 unhone bataaya ki jabase puraane noton par roak lagi he tab se sharaab kii dukaanon par sannata chaaya hua he or sharaab kii bikri main kareeb 40 pratishat kami ai he 
 When the sale of liquor is less, the government will also get less revenue, because the number of people buying liquor from the new note is very small and instructions have been given to all liquor shops not to take the old note
 aabkaari adhikari devraj singh ke mutabik sharaab kii bikri saamaanya hone main abhi kareeb ek maheene kaa samay lagegaa kyonki jab logon ke paas nae note hi nahin honge to log sharaab kahaan se kharidenge
 He says that due to this the Excise Department will suffer a lot of revenue loss

 Due to this, the liquor traders are doing a lot of damage because they had put a large amount of liquor in the shops keeping in mind the wedding season, but now the sales are very low
 vah kehete hai ki jab bikri hi nahin hogi to sarkaar ko rajasav kahaan se milegaa

 hamaare paas sarkaar banane ke chah formule hai, lekin sarkaar kis formule par banegi, yah paristhitiyon par nirbhar karegaa
 It is clear from this comment of a senior BJP leader sharing all options with India Today that the party which has been in exile in Delhi for 15 years is not in the mood to wait any longer
 centre main narendra modi ke netritv vaali bahumat kii sarkaar banane ke baad bijepi ko dilli kii satta main aane kaa yah sunaharaa avasar najar aa rahaa he
 Despite the tremendous 'modi wave' in the Lok Sabha elections, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) vote share in Delhi increased by almost three and a half per cent and the BJP has lagged behind in 11 assembly seats
 aise maahaul main bijepi phir se chunaav main jane kaa jokhim nahin lenaa chaahati
 Lt
 Governor Najeeb Jung's meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh after the change of power at the Center has had a direct impact on the politics of the province
 lekin sarkaar kaise banegi isko lekar bijepi main ek raay nahin he
 Jagdish Mukhi, a strong contender for the post of Chief Minister in the event of forming a government in Delhi, says, “I have given my report at every level in the party, including political analysis with data
 vidhayakon ne bhi apni raay di he
 There is a democratic process of decision in BJP and we will follow whatever decision is taken
 ”sarkaar banane kaa ‘sixsar’jod-tod se hi sahi, lekin desh kii rajdhani dilli ko aakhir sarkaar milanaa tay ho gaya he
 The reason for bjp's increased interest in government formation is that most of the mlas are not currently in favor of elections
 isi maukey ko bhaanpakar bijepi ne sarkaar banane ke liye chah formule party ke kendriya netritv ke saamne likhit rup se bhej die hai, jis par pradhanmantri modi ko aakhri faisla lenaa he
 The first option is that if the Lieutenant Governor wishes, a government of a minority can be run for a full five years
 is vikalp main sadan ke bheetar matdaan ke samay 5-7 vidhayak baahar chale jaaen or dhvanimat se sarkaar vishwasamat hasil kar le
 Delhi BJP leaders have cited the example of the Narasimha Rao government at the Center
 bijepi kaa doosraa vikalp he ki kisi bhi party se do-tihaai vidhayak tuutakar aaen or bijepi main vilay kar len
 a third option related to this has been suggested that if 18 mlas break up with you, then the matter can be made
 jabaki chauthe vikalp ke taur par congress ke aath main se chah vidhayak ko todgaye kaa formula he
 For this option, BJP MLA Ramvir Singh Vidhuri, who is in the BJP just before the assembly elections, is trying
 lekin congress se tuutakar aane vaale sambhavit vidhayakon ne vidhudi ko mukhyamantri banane kii shart rakh di he, jiske liye bijepi taiyaar nahin he
 However, one option is to form a government by including six Congress mlas in the Akali Dal
 lekin congress vidhayak matin ahamed bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar banane kii kavayad se inkaar kar rahe hai
 He says, "there is no power in rumors
" jo bijepi netaaon se mulaakaat kii baat kar rahe hai main unhen chunauti detaa hum ki sabit karke dikhaaen
 “the fifth option before the BJP is that even if six AAP mlas resign from the post of MLA, the party can be formed
 aakhri vikalp ke taur par party ne bihar or uttar pradesh kaa udhaaharan diya he
 Under this option, bjp's strategy is to get three AAP mlas to vote in their favor
 jiske baad aap vidhayak dal kii ore se vidhansabha spikar ko vip ulanghan karne vaale vidhayakon kii sadsyta khaarij karne kii apil kii ja sakati he or spikar us par apane hisaab se kuch saal kaa bhi samay le sakate hai
 On being asked about this option from a senior BJP leader that the Speaker is an AAP member in the Delhi Legislative Assembly, then how can he be expected to delay the decision? To this the confident leader's reply was, "those three members may also have speakers
 ”kya he majaburicageriwal ne bijepi ke khilaaf abhiyaan ched diya he or vidhayakon kii kharid-farokht kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 But on behalf of the party, MLA Jagdish Mukhi, who is leading the race for the post of Chief Minister, calls Kejriwal as a false trend
 ve palatwaar karte hai, “kya kejariwal ne bhi congress ke vidhayakon ko samarthan ke badale main 20-20 karod ru
 Were given ” bijepi alaakaman ko di gai report main dilli bijepi netaaon ne kaha he ki nae chunaav kii sthiti main party kaa pradarshan pehle jaisaa nahin rahegaa
 About half a dozen dots are counted behind it
 jinamein loksabhaa chunaav main aap ke bade vot share ke alaava bijli-pani ke masale par kharaab sthiti, rail kiraaya, petrol-dijal ke daam main hui badhotaree, mahangaai kaa kaabo se baahar hona or bijli kii keemton main hui badhotaree aadi shaamil he
 But the most apprehension is from the style of Kejriwal
 bijepi ko dar he ki agar kisi bhi tarah kejariwal waapas dilli kii satta main aa gaye to narendra modi kii sarkaar ke liye museebataan bad sakati hai jo philhal sudhaarwadi nitiyon ko sakhti se lagu karne kii pakshdhar he
 Delhi, which is under President's rule, is now set to get an elected government, but Modi will have its door

 anya partiyon ne bharat kii sansthaaon par kabja karne ke liye kabhi hamalaa nahin kiya, lekin aresas kar rahaa he
 'on Wednesday, in Hamburg, Germany, Rahul Gandhi had said that in the 21st century, if you will not give space to anyone
 agar aap kisi ko koi vijan nahin denge, to kisi anya jagah se use vijan milegaa
 Saying this, he gave the example of Islamic State (IS)
 unhone kaha tha ki jab america ke ek kanoon ne iraq ke ek samudaay ko sarkari naukariyon se bedakhal rakhaa, to unhone ek aatanki group (IS) bana liya
 Such policies are only in bad shape in Iraq and Syria today
 'chuttee manaane landan gaye'rahul ke pichley bhaashan par bolte hue sambit paatra ne kaha ki kal aap ISIS main berozegaron ke jane kii baat kar rahe the or aaj aap muslim brotherhud se tulana kar rahe hai
 It shows your frustration
 2014 ke chunaav ke thik pehle aapaki party ke grih mantri ne sonia gandhi, manmohan singh or aapaki maujuudagi main bijepi ko aatanki training dene vaala kaha tha jo tab pakistan main hedline bani
 Today, we are talking the same way again, then it will become the headline of Pakistan
 unhone rahul par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki aap hinduon se ghrinaa kyon karte hai
 a few days ago you called Congress a Muslim party
 aaj aapane kaha ki bijepi muslim brotherhud jaisi he
 Rahul ji people of RSS are distributing aid in Kerala
 unki madad kar rahe hai
 Atalji also comes from the idea of RSS
 nehruji ne aresas ko ganatantr diwas par bulaayaa tha
 You apologize right there
 ham jaanate hai ki aap chuttee manaane gaye hai
 We know you are not going to come back soon

 dharmik bhaawanaaon ko aahat karne ke aaropon ke bich aamir khan kii haalia relies filmfkh ko lekar virodhbadhata ja rahaa he
 Protests and demonstrations in Bhopal and Ahmedabad on Monday followed by protests on Tuesday in Haryana as well as in the national capital Delhi
 pradarshnakariyon main bajrang dal or vishwa hindu parishad ke kaaryakarta mukhya rup se shaamil rahe
 Workers of Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal staged a massive protest and set the film's posters on fire even before the film's first show was screened at Suncity in Hisar
 jabaki south dilli ke vasant vihaar ilaake main piviar priya ke baahar bajrang dal ne film ke pradarshan ko rokane kii maang kii
 The activists warned that if the film was played, they would vandalize theaters and the administration would be responsible for it
 duusari ore, hisar ke aiji anil kumaar raav kaa kahana he ki unhen abhi tak maamle kii koi jaankaree nahin he
 While on the question of hooliganism, Rao said that it is possible that some people are opposing the film, but the administration has no role in it
 unhone kaha ki vah maamle main espi report lenge
 It is worth noting that earlier on Monday, Bajrang Dal held a protest in the film at Nebhopal
 vahaan police ke saath kaaryakartaaon kii jhadap bhi hui
 Along with this, Hinduist organizations also vandalized inside the cinema in Ahmedabad of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat
 bhopal main jyoti cinema ke saamne bajrang dal ke do darjan kaaryakartaaon ne 'pike' film or aamir khan ke virodh main jamkar narebaaji kii or cinema haul ke get par pradarshan kiya
 However, even before the Bajrang Dal's performance, the cinema house management removed the posters of the film and locked the gate
 iske baavjood bajrang dal kaaryakartaaon ne cinema haul ke get par jabaran ghusane ko lekar police ke saath jhadap kii
 The Bajrang Dal demanded the government to stop the screening of the film and warned to stop the screening of the film
 bajrang dal ke sanyojak kamalesh thakur ne kaha, 'hinduon kii bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunchane kii sajeesh kii ja rahi he or hinduon kii ghar vaapasi ko rokane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 But the organization will not allow the film to be screened inside Bhopal
 'ramdev or shankaracharya bhi narajacinema gharon main 'pike' film ke pradarshan par yoga gurubaba ramdevor shankaracharya swaroopanand saraswati ne bhi aapatti jataai he
 Swami Ramdev has spoken to the people of the Hindu community to organize, so that those who hurt the feelings of the people can be opposed
 haalanki is puure maamle main sensor board ne apni raay spasht kar di he ki vah film ke kisi seen par pabandi nahin lagayegaa
 Censor board chair Leela Samson said the board had already given proof of releasing the film
 aise main isaki har lihaaj se jaanch kii gai he
 That is, there is no question of any kind of restriction
 police kisi bhi desh kii ho, use kisi apradhi ko pakadaney se pehle tamaam mashkkat kerani hi padati he
 But the Los Angeles police also had to be mocked for arresting a dwarf
 police inspector dwaara shaks ko giraftaar karne kaa yah video in dinon soshal media paraviral ho rahaahe
 In this video of about 2 minutes, the police inspector is seen running after the man wearing half pants
 ye shaks kabhi khambhe par to kabhi road par bhaagta rahata he
 You will not be able to stop laughing after watching this video
 is tarah boune shaks ne police ko kiya tang It is to be known that apart from Amethi, Rahul Gandhi is also contesting from Wayanad in Kerala
 kerala main to congress adhyaksh kaa jeetna lagbhag tay he
 But Amethi's bet will go till the last round count
 kyonki donon ummidavaaron ke bich vaaki main kaante kii takkar dekhne ko mil rahi he
 These figures may seem shocking, but Smriti Irani has been making such claims from the beginning
 jab rahul gandhi ne vynad kii seat chuni thi to unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi apni loksabhaa seat se anupasthit to rahete hi the, ab bhagauda ho gaye hai
 At the same time, Congress strategists kept claiming on different occasions that Rahul Gandhi would win this time by almost double the difference from previous elections
 philhal, aisa hota dikh nahin rahaa
 Why the result? It will be known only in the evening
 lekin narendra modi (narendra Modi) kii lahar main rahul gandhi ke liye amethi ke kile bachaa paanaa behad hi mushkil ho gaya he

 duusari taraf agle saal jaise bihar main chunaav hone hai vahaan mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne khud is baat ke sanket die hai ki bhaajapa ke bina chunaav main jane ke vikalp par ve philhal vichaar nahin kar rahe hai kyonki bihar main unki sarkaar bina kisi hastkshep ke chal rahi he
 But Nitish also knows that just as he has shared equal seats in the Lok Sabha elections, in the assembly elections also the BJP will try to align on its own terms
 kinhin muddon par nitish kumaar kaa stand desh kii raajnneeti main ab koi myne nahin rakhata, jo kuch bhi ve kar rahe hai vah maatr sankethik he
 Eight suspected Taliban militants were killed and 10 others injured in a clash between policemen and protesters in Kandahar region of Afghanistan
 khabaron ke mutabik, yah ghatana buudhvaar ko us vakt hui jab pakistani sena ke nanagarhaar pradesh ke goshta jile main ghuspaith karne ke virodh main badi sankhya main log maivaand jile main pradarshan kar rahe the
 "but taking advantage of this opportunity, the Taliban militants broke into the protestors and opened fire on the police, killing eight militants in retaliation for the police," an official said
 'pakistan or afghanistan ke seemaa suraksha balon ke bich goshta jile main gat buudhvaar se do baar golibari ho chuki he
 Since then, people in various cities including Kandahar have been protesting against the alleged infiltration of Pakistan
 goa se modi kaa khaas rishta rahaa he
 After the Gujarat riots, when the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was adamant on removing him from the Chief Minister's chair, it was Advani who saved him
 lekin usee goa main kaaryakarini kii baithak main isi saal 9 june ko jab modi ko kendriya chunaav abhiyaan samiti kii kaman saunpi gai to adwani ke ek stroke ne modi kii chhavi ko party main hi vivaadit bana diya
 The second major setback came as the JD (U) parted ways with the NDA and the BJP was out of power in Bihar
 modi ko paroksh rup se piem ummidavaar ke taur par project karne kaa zyada asar party ke surveykshanon main nahin dikh rahaa tha, jabaki unke naam par party coder main khaasaa utsaah tha
 The BJP was aware of this, but it found a way to move forward when the message of "demand of the people" from the Sangh was sent to the BJP
 haalanki sangh is maamle main kisi dakhal se inkaar kar rahaa he or apni bhoomika ko salaah dene tak simit bataa rahaa he
 But it is clear from Rajnath's enthusiasm and his attempt to ignore a leader like Advani for the second time in a row that in the end the Sangh signaled to move forward and gave the gift before Modi's birthday on 17 September
 sangh-bijepi ke rishte par sarkarywah bhaiyyaji joshi india today se kah chuke hai, “aakhir bijepi kaa nirmaan kyon hua? sangh ke mudde par hi janata party se alag hokar vah astitv main ai, isliye kuch na kuch rishte to bane hue hai
 But this does not mean that the Sangh has influence over all its decisions
 ”modi ke naam ke elaan ke liye sintabar maheene kii 13 taarikh chuni gai
 a Sangh leader says, "the number 13 is auspicious for us
 vaajapeyi kii 13 din, 13 maheene kii sarkaar or ab 13 taarikh ko modi ke naam kaa elaan
 "but Modi needs an action policy, not an astrologer
 shivaraj kii hetric kaa daub sawaal uth rahaa he ki adwani ko kinare kar faisla kyon liya gaya? agar vidhansabha chunaav ke baad aisa hota to koun-sa pahaad tut padataa? is bare main donon khemon kii alag-alag daleelein hai
 According to the Sangh, the issue of development was being left behind by confusion over leadership
 lekin adwani kheme kii daleel thi ki chunaav abhiyaan samiti kii bagdor saunpkar party ne modi ke bare main sandesh de diya he
 By projecting a direct PM candidate, the remaining issues will be secondary and the trailing Congress will get the basis to contest elections as Modi
 iske alaava adwani kii ore se vidhansabha chunaav main dhruvikaran kii daleel bhi di gai
 But Modi supporters argued that Advani is talking about waiting till the assembly elections to advance Shivraj
 modi kii mahatvakanksha ke peeche chouhan bhale ek vajah hon, lekin duusari vajah ishrat-soharabuddin, tulsi prajapati farji muthbhedon or anya maamalon main jis tarah modi ke khilaaf gherebandi ho rahi he, usase aane vaale samay main unki piem pad kii daavedaari par party main mushkilen bad sakati thim
 Even before that Modi wanted to reach a safe zone, where the attack on him should be considered as an attack on the party
 ab pradhanmantri ummidavaar ban jane kii sthiti main modi par jaanch agenciyon kaa shikanja kasne ko party chunaav main bhunaakar doharaa laabh uthaa sakati he

 Actually, Karan apologized to Kajol and Ajay in the beginning of their show
 saath hi ye bhi kaha ki unhen is baat kaa malaal he ki apni kitaab main unhone is ladaai kaa zikr kiya
 By the way, both of these differences happened during the release of 'A Dill Hai Mushkil' and 'shivaay'

 " grih mantralay ne trust banane kii prakriya shuru kicourt ne 3 maheene ke bheetar hi trust banane kaa diya aadevyodhya maamle par supreme court ke aadesh ke baad ram mandir ke liye trust kaa gathan shuru ho gaya he
 According to sources, the Ministry of Home Affairs has started the process of forming a trust
 court ke aadesh kaa adhyayan karne ke liye naukarshahon kii ek team gathit kii gai he
 At the same time, legal opinion is also being sought from the Attorney General and the Ministry of Law
 supreme court ke aadesh ke anusaar sarkaar ko 3 maheene ke bheetar hi ram mandir nirmaan ke liye trust bananaa hoga
 Let me tell you that the decision came on Saturday after hearing for 40 days continuously in the Supreme Court in the Ayodhya dispute case
 faisle main kaha gaya ki ram mandir vivaadit sthal par banegaa or masjid nirmaan ke liye ayodhya main paanch acre jameen alag se di jaaegi
 The court stated that the disputed 2
 77 acre jameen centre sarkaar ke adheen rahegi
 Will it be formed on the lines of Somnath, it is possible that Ram temple trust of Ayodhya should be formed on the lines of Gujarat Kesomnath temple trust
 somnath mandir trust main keval 6 sadsy hai magar sarkaar ayodhya mandir trust ke sadasyon kii sankhya or zyada kar sakati he
 According to sources, the role of the Prime Minister may also be important in the selection and approval of the trust member
 trust main jahaan ram janmabhumi nyaas, nirmohi akhaada ke alaava kuch bade dharmaguru shaamil kiye ja sakate hai, vahiin duusari ore samaaj ke kuch varisht naagarik, ram mandir se jude sanghathanon ko bhi isamen joda ja saktaa he
 Not only this, the work of the trust should be at a fast pace and the representatives of the central and state government can also join it to keep the working style efficient
 pradhanmantri modi khud ram mandir se judi pragati par najar rakh paaen, iske liye pradhanmantri karyaalay se bhi kisi ko sadsy banaaya ja saktaa he
 However, in order to form a trust, it is necessary that its scope should be fixed and the responsibility of each of its members should also be fixed

 During an afternoon banquet with Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister Narendra Modi bowed his neck to Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas and in-charge of Bihar BJP and asked, "chirag ki ho?" Modi was talking of dissatisfaction with Ram Vilas Paswan's son over ticket distribution
 chiraag ne apni lok janashakti party (algepi) ko “mahaj” 40 siten dene par kaha ki isse unhen “jhatka” laga
 Out of 243 assembly seats in Bihar, BJP retained 160 seats for itself, 20 seats for Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hindustan Awam Morcha (HAM) and 23 seats for Upendra Kushwaha's RLSP
 bihar main pehle charan kaa matdaan 12 aktubar he isliye modi gahari dilchaspee le rahe hai or unhen dulaare noujvaan paswan kaa tej-tarraar or faislakun ravaiya raas aayaa he, jo haal hi ke maheenon main aljeepi ke mukhya pravaktaa or bijepi ke saath mukhya vaartakar ke taur par ubhare hai
 During an afternoon banquet with Wickremesinghe, Pradhan assured Modi that the BJP would take care of the interests of Chirag and LGP
 kuch dinon baad bijepi apane hisse main se algepi ko do or siten dene ke liye raji ho gai, haalanki isaki ghoshnaa abhi tak nahin kii gai he
 Ram Vilas Paswan is so important in the alliance because he holds 5 percent of Paswan and Pasi votes in the state
 jatiyon ke pher main fanse bihar main yah votbank paswan ke prati vafaadaar rahaa he, phir chaahe unhone kisi bhi party ke saath milakar chunaav ladaa ho
 This is clearly the reason why BJP President Amit Shah accepted the demand for a few more seats and gave them 42 seats instead of 40
 vikasshil samaaj adhyayan centre (siesds) ke lokaneeti ke liye shreyas saradesai ke vishleshan ke mutabik, 2004 ke aam chunaav main jab algepi ne argedy or congress ke saath milakar chunaav ladaa tha, 58 fisadi paasiyon ne algepi ko vot diya tha
 In the February 2005 Bihar elections when the LJP and the Congress joined hands, 60 per cent of the Pasi voters voted for Paswan's party
 2009 ke loksabhaa or 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main jab algepi ne lalu ke saath chunaav ladaa to 50 fisadi paasi vot is gathbandhan ke khate main gaye the
 And in 2014, when the party merged with the NDA, 41 per cent of the passers voted for this alliance
 bijepi netaa maanate hai ki bihar ke mahadaliton kii siyasat main maanjhi 20 siten hasil kar paae, to sirf isliye nahin ki ve purv mukhyamantri hai, balki unki musahar jati mahadalit birdari kii ek ahm jati he
 Once Mahadalit used to be with RJD, but has been with JD (U) and BJP for the last 15 years
 paswan maanate hai ki yah chunaav bahut “haai-fi” ho gaya he
 He says, "this election will have a huge impact on national politics
 khaskar jab mukhyamantri pad kaa koi ummidavaar nahin he isliye modi ji ke raaj ke pichley 15 maheene hi vah paimaana honge, jiske bainks endie par faisla sunaaya jayega
 "so is Chirag taking over the command of the party from his father? Without dismissing the change of command, Chirag says, "they are the sun and the moon
" babuji ne achche din, bure din or vaaki bahut bure din dekhe hai
 i have learned everything from them
 ” paswan bataate hai ki unhone apane bete ke faislon par kabhi sawaal nahin uthaae&na tab jab ve bollywood main janaa chaahate the or na tab jab bal bhure rang main rang liye
 He says, "I belong to the 20th century, Chirag belongs to the 21st century
 main apane vichaar un par kyon thopus?”ek ahm baat yah he ki dharmendra pradhan ke saath kuch der kii us charchaa main modi ne apane upabhokta maamalon, khaadya or saarvajanik vitaran mantri kaa koi zikr nahin kiya, baavjood iske ki bihar ke sabase varisht mantri hone ke naate rajya kii nabj par jaisi pakad bade paswan kii he, waisi mushkil se hi kisi or kii he
 He contested his first election in 1969 from the Aloli assembly seat as a candidate of the United Socialist Party
 yah us daur se bhi pehle kii baat he, jab 1970 ke dashak main madhya main jaiprakash narayan ne “sampurna kranti” kaa aahvaan karke rajya kii siyasat main netaaon kii maujuuda fasal ke beej boe the
 The beating of BJP and other alliance partners is also strong in this time of Bihar elections, but perhaps one aspect of this is that during this time, the ljp's reins were more or less handed over from father to son
 kareeb 40 saal ke siyaasi tajurbe ke saath paswan isse beshak khush dikhaai dete hai ki bollywood abhinayta se siyasatdan bana betaa unki viraasat sambhaal rahaa he
 He told India Today, "chirag has been accepted by both old and new generations, any father would be proud of him
 ” ve bataate hai ki yah chiraag hi the jinhone 2014 ke aam chunaav ke thik pehle unhen upie chhodkar endie main aane ke liye manaaya
 This is when Chirag wrote many letters to Rahul Gandhi and while waiting for his reply, finally got tired
 bade paswan bataate hai, “chiraag ne mujhase kaha tha, “babuji, aapke secularavaad, sampradayikta-virodh or saamaajik nyaay ke usul bahut ahm hai, lekin utana hi ahm atmasamman bhi he
 "the arrival of young Chirag on the political plank of Bihar in 2012 was as valuable as it was for the troubled party at that time, equally dramatic
 paswan us vakt bistar par the or maharajaganj ke upachunaav ke liye prachaar nahin kar paa rahe the
 Then someone advised him to call Chirag from Mumbai
 us daur ke bare main bade paswan kehete hai, “to chiraag tipical filmi style main pahunche, haath hilaate hue or sidhe bheed ke dilon main utar gaye
 Lalu ji faded! ”chirag admits that when he came to meet his father in 2012, he felt“ heavy intoxication ”by seeing the enthusiasm of the crowd towards him
 isse unki film mili naa mili ham ke flop hone kaa malaal jaataa rahaa
 Chirag says, "there was a song in that film," Katto Squirrel ", that made me very popular in Bihar
 bollywood or siyasat is lihaaj se ek sareekhe hai ki donon hi peshon main aapako apane prati bheed kaa josh dekhne ko miltaa he
 It was not easy to persuade Paswan
 32 baras ke yuva paswan kehete hai, “haa, 2002 ke godhra dange ho chuke the or saikadon musalmaan maare gaye the, isi mudde par unhone endie chodi tha
 i told him that Godhra era has passed like the Emergency or the Bhagalpur riots of 1989
 unhen iske liye raji karne main mujhe kai din lage ki hamen modi ke saath janaa chahie
 "but the fact is that in Modi's BJP, Paswan's father-son importance is only as long as he promises to win seats by promising them
 chiraag bheed to juta sakate hai, magar yah ramvilas paswan kii saamaajik nyaay kii saakh hi he, jisase vot jutaney kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 BJP knows this thing better than others

 ) pakistan ke purv captain vakaar younus ne isisi vishwa cap-2019 main england ke khilaaf match main haar ke baad bhartiya team kii khel bhaavana par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 England had set a target of 338 runs against India in the match played at Edgbaston on Sunday
 bhartiya team 306 ran hi bana saki or match haar gai
 This is his first defeat in this World Cup
 is haar se pakistan team ke semifinal main jane kii sambhaavna ko nuksaan hua he
 Waqar did not say in clear terms but has tried to say indirectly that India lost the match intentionally so that Pakistan could not reach the semi-finals
 vakaar ne twitor par likhaa, 'aap koun hai yah baat myne nahin rakhti
 
 aap apane jivan main kya karte hai, wo aapako paribhaashit karata he
 i do not care whether the Pakistan team will go to the semi-finals or not, but one thing is clear
 
 The spirit of the game of some champions was tested and they failed miserably
 'isse pehle, pakistan ke purv khilaadi basit ali or sikandar bakht ne bharat-england match se pehle kaha tha ki pakistan ko semifinal main jane se rokane ke liye bhartiya team jaanboojh kar haaregi
 If India had defeated England in Sunday's match, it would have become a little easier for Pakistan to make the semi-finals because then they would have only won from Bangladesh
 ab agar pakistan apane agle match main bangladesh ko haraa bhi detaa he to use duusari tiimon ke parinaamon par nirbhar rahanaa hoga

 Leh and Ladakh have direct connection with Goa
 aap zarur jaananaa chahenge ki akhir ye kaise sambhav he
 Actually, the employees working in the mess in the hotel where they stayed in Leh started talking
 baatcheet main maaloom chalaa ki jo shaks vahaan kaam kar rahe hai wo saare bihar-upi ke log hai
 When asked how did you come to Leh, brother, his simple answer was that we come in april-may and we work here till October and we also get less money from the locals here
 phir bhi ham kaam karne ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai kyonki ham hotel vyavsaay main kaam karte hai isliye hamaara rahane kaa or khaane kaa karch nahin hota he
 That is why even if the salary is less than the local people, then we save all the salary that we send to our village
 yahi vajah he ki yahaan ke hotalon main sthaneey log kam or baahar se aae log zyaada kaam karte hai
 Then the same person also told me that as soon as the cold falls here, they go to Goa in the months of October and November
 goa main tab tak sizan shuru ho chukaa hota he or goa kaa sizan jo he wo april tak chalata he
 They work there in Goa which is a hotel on the banks of the Shack and then they come to Leh in the month of april-may because then the season has started here and there is a crowd of tourists
 ye log yahaan par thand ke vaqt tak kaam karte hai or phir thand shuru hote hi goa nikal jate hai
 So, they continue to get work throughout the year
 jis shaks ne ye baat mujhe bataayi uskaa kahana tha ki uske kai dost hai jo manali jaisi jagahon par yaa baaqi thandi jagahon par garmi ke dinon main kaam karte hai or thand jab badhati he to phir wo goa yaa phir jo samudr kinare bade shahar hai jahaan kaafii paryatak jate hai, wo vahaan chale jate hai
 You will find many places that work in the hill station in summer and in Goa, especially in Leh, because in winter, hotels are also closed here
 isi tarah yah silsilaa saalon se chalata aa rahaa he or yahi he leh kaa goa conection

 While the kangana-hrithik controversy is coming out one by one on the same day, now Bollywood stars have also started breaking their silence on this controversy
 haal hi main akshay kumaar ne kangana rithik vivaad ko lekar apane hi andaaj main vichaar rakhe
 Actor Akshay Kumar, who lives in the same building that Hrithik lives in, when asked about the controversy, what would you like to say about the Bollywood-going Kangana Warrior these days? So he jokingly replied that this war is going on in my building, not in Bollywood
