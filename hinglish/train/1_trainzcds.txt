 Nearly eight years after the constitution was amended to make education a fundamental right, the government today enacted this historic law to provide free and compulsory education to every child between six and 14 years
 shiksha ko moulik adhikaar banane vaale 86wein samvidhan sanshodhan ko sansad ne varsh 2002 main paarit kiya tha
 The law to implement this fundamental right 'children's Right to get free and compulsory education Act' was passed by Parliament last year
 samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak tathaa nayaa kanoon donon aaj se lagu ho gaye hai
 Under the new law, it will now be obligatory for the state governments and local bodies to ensure that every child receives education in a nearby school
 yah kanoon sidhe-sidhe kareeb un ek karod bacchon ke liye phydemand hoga jo is samay skool nahin ja rahe hai
 These children, who have left school in the middle or have never lived in any educational institution, will be admitted to schools
 soochna ke adhikaar adhinium or rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee adhinium ke baad shiksha kaa adhikaar samprag sarkaar kii ek pramukh uplabdhi bataaya jaataa he
 An official of the ministry said that at present there are about 22 crore children in the respective classes in the age group of six to 14 years
 haalanki inamen se 4
 6 per cent (about 92 lakh) are out of school
 is kanoon ke lagu hone ke baad skool prabandhan samiti yaa sthaneey prashasan chah saal se upar ke bich main skool chhodane vaale yaa kabhi skool nahin gaye bacchon kii pahchaan karegaa or unki umr ke anusaar unhen vishesh prashikshan dene ke baad kakshaon main bhartee karaayaa jayega
 The law makes every child's right to education
 adhinium sabhi sambandhit sarkaron ke liye yah sunishchit karnaa badhyakaari karata he ki har baccha muft praathmik shiksha praapt kare
 It has also made mandatory provision in the Act that private educational institutions will also have to reserve 25 per cent seats for children from weaker sections
 kuch skulon ne is kanoon ko ‘asanvaidhanik’ qaraar dete hue ise pehle hi ucchtam nyaayalay main chunauti de di he
 They called it a violation of the fundamental rights of unaided private educational institutions
 lekin maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal ne kaha he ki kanoonee prakriya se kanoon ko lagu kiye jane par asar nahin padegaa
 The Finance Commission has provided an amount of 25 thousand crores to the states to implement this act
 sarkaar ke anumaan ke anusaar, is kanoon ko lagu karne ke liye agle paanch saal main 1
 71 lakh crore will be needed
 sibbal ne kaha ki sarkaar ne kanoon ko lagu karne ke liye jaruri dhan kaa prabandhan kiya he
 The provisions of the Act states that no school can refuse to admit a student and all schools should have trained teachers
 yadi kisi skool ke paas prashikshit adhyaaapak nahin hai to use teen saal ke bheetar bheetar isaki vyavastha kerani hogi
 According to the new law, schools will have to have adequate number of teachers, playgrounds and infrastructural facilities
 kuch vanchit skulon ko adhinium ke niyamon kaa paalan karne main sakasham banane ke liye sarkaar koi vyavastha sthapit karegi
 The government has already prepared some model rules and these model laws have been sent to the states to help them make their own rules in implementing the new law
 kendra sarkaar ne kendra shasit pradeshon ke liye alag se niyam banaae hai jinhen agle saptaah vidhi mantralay adhishuchet karegaa
 According to the new rules, local bodies and state governments will go door to door and survey the neighborhood schools to ensure that all children are sent to school
 nae kanoon ke jariye yah sunishchit kiya jayega ki alpsankhyak or pichde varg samet sabhi samudaayon ke bacchon ko acchhee shiksha mili
 But reservation for weaker sections will not be applicable from this year as admissions for the session have already been almost completed
 ise varsh 2011-12 se lagu kiya jayega

 Later, after picking up the article printed in the newspaper, he will make a book to see how much media and journalists are praising his plans
 kya yah acha he? kya aisa hona chahie? to phir aap akhbaar kisalie kharidenge, tivi kyon dekhenge? agar tarah-tarah se patrkaar or media ko prabhavit karne ke tareeke nikaale jaaenge to aam janata tak media kii sachai kaise pahonchegi? non resident indian ko kaise pataa chalegaa ki bharat ke akhabaaron main jo lekh chapa he uski tarif ke liye sarkaar ne tender nikaala he?jharkhand mukti morcha ke netaa hemanth sorain ne ise sarkari bhrashtachar bataaya he
 Hemant Soren has tweeted, tagging the Government of Jharkhand, Press Council, Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, that it is now official that our honorable Chief Minister Raghubar Das has laid all the rules of ethics and principles
 sarkaar kaa prachaar vibhaag khulaa vigyaapan de rahaa he ki patrkaar vikaas par likhen or fees ke taur par paise kamaayen
 The Hindu newspaper has published the statement of Ajay Nath Jha, Deputy Director of Public Relations Department of the state
 jisamen ve kehete hai ki yah ped news nahi he
 Applications have been sought from journalists to write about the welfare schemes of the government
 unke lekh kaamyaab kahani ho sakati he or aalochanatmak ho sakati he
 We want to evaluate our plans independently
 vigyaapan main aisa kuch nahin likhaa he ki jo lekh honge unamem sarkaar kii yojanaon kii aalochana bhi ho sakati he
 If the government has to publish critical articles on its plans, then journalists can do it themselves, that is the work of the newspaper
 kya vaaki aap darshak itane bhole hai ki sarkaar paise dekar swatantra patrakaron se aalochanatmak moolyankan karaayegi? kya aap sari baaten samaj paa rahe hai ki khabar kya he, vigyaapan kya he? hamane press council aaf india kii ek aisi cameti ke sadsy rahe praanjay guha thakurataa se baat kii he
 Pranjaya had served in a subcommittee many years ago, 'paid News, How Corruption in the Indian Media Undermines Democracy' means how the news is weakening India's democracy
 36000 shabdon kii vah report he jo press kanunsil aaf india kii website par uplabdh he
 So you wonder where we have come
 sarkaar vigyaapan nikaal rahi he, patrakaron se kah rahi he ki uski yojanaon kii tarif karen, apane akhabaaron main chhapavaen or paise le jaaen
 Yet the Deputy Director says that she wants to get independent journalists reviewed
 saaf-saaf likhaa he ki apane yaa duusare akhbaar main
 
 
 This means that journalists working in any newspaper can also apply
 agar sarkaar ko apni yojanaon kii samiksha hi karwaani he to kyon nahin vah sieji report ko vigyaapan ke taur par chhapava detii he jise taiyaar karne main janata kaa karodon rupaya kharch hota he
 Achintya Ganguly of the Telegraph newspaper published a report on 29 December 2018
 is report main kaha gaya he ki jharkhand vidhansabha patal par silk, textile, hendicraft deveopment karporation kii report pesh kii gai
 The CAG has caught a massive financial scam in this department
 farzi ricard banaakar 18
 Rs 41 crore was spent on distributing blankets
 kya jharkhand sarkaar patrakaron ko apane lekh main aisi soochna daalane ke liye 15000 rupee degi? bilkul nahin degi
 Now you think, what crime was done by Pawan Kumar Jaiswal, a journalist from Mirzapur in UP against whom an FIR was registered
 unhone bhi to sarkaar kii ek yojana kii samiksha pesh kii thi ki sarkaar karodon kharch karti he phir bhi mid de mile main roti or namak khaane ko diya ja rahaa he
 20,000 in UP for critical review and FIR in Jharkhand
 ek trend chal rahaa he
 Every week a new theme is launched on which the media starts debating and forgets the rest of the issues
 is hafte kaa taapic he hindi
 Debatable statements are being made about Hindi
 isi tarah sanskrit ko lekar bahes yogya bayaan die jate the lekin sanskrit kaa kya hua? tab sanskrit ko lekar bhavukta paidaa kii ja rahi thi
 Why is the candle march on the streets of Banaras taking place with Sanskrit again
 aap sanskrit ko lekar kuch kah dijie, ho saktaa he saare channel jhaanv-jhaanv karne lagen, shahar kaa shahar umad pade
 But look at the situation of this candle march on Sanskrit, it seems as if Sara Banaras has started speaking French nowadays
 kisi ko sanskrit se matlab hi nahin he
 Why is there a sit-in demonstration at Sampurnanand Sanskrit University since 18 days
 yah bharat kii badi sanskrit uniwarsity he
 But did you hear any big news about it in five years
 kya sanskrit main shapath lekar yaa do-chaar shloke twit kar dhak jamaane vaale netaaon main se koi sampoornanad sanskrit uniwarsity gaya? ham aksar bhashaa kii bahes ko daaen-baayen tahalaakar chhod dete hai, lekin kabhi bhashaa se sambandhit sansthaanon kaa haal nahin jaanate hai
 The building of this university is so beautiful
 dekhne se lagata he ki oxford yaa cambridge uniwarsity kii imaarat he
 This building dated to 1852
 kabhi is uniwarsity ko banaras kaa cheharaa nahin banaaya jaataa he
 Today there should have been 112 teachers in this historic university but there are only 32
 yahaan par 79 shikshakon kii kami he
 Only 250 are working instead of 500 non-teaching staff
 unamem se bhi zyaadaatar kantrect par kaam kar rahe hai
 Recently, 58 people working for 15 years were removed because the university had no money
 30 june ke baad se kantrect par rakhe gaye 18 chaukeedaar nikaal die gaye hai
 Janitor
 
 
 chaukeedaar
 
 par chunaav hua, chunaav hote hi sanskrit uniwarsity se 18 chaukeedaar nikaal die gaye hai
 There is 3 crore electricity bill left on this university
 jab bhi bhashaa ko lekar bahes hogi, bhujaaen tani hongi, ham kitni jaldi sanskrit ko lekar hone vaale rajnatik pradarshan or bahes ko bhul gaye
 We are doing the same thing with Hindi
 is saal june main loksabhaa main maanav sansaadhan mantri ne sanskrit ko lekar ek bayaan diya tha jisamen kaha tha ki desh main 15 sanskrit uniwarsity hai
 Three of them are deemed universities
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke naam se jane jate hai, jinke 12 campus he
 Here, fifty percent of the teachers were teaching on contract
 ye soochna kuch samay pehle kii he
 However, in the month of June, the Minister of Human Resources said in a statement that 12 universities are funded by the state governments
 inke saath 1000 paaramparik college jude hai
 While there are 1748 posts of teachers, only 949 posts are teachers
 46 pratishat pad khaali hai
 163 out of 490 posts are vacant in Delhi
 upi main 172 manzur pad hai shikshakon ke, lekin 113 khaali he
 If there will be a debate on Sanskrit in UP, then all these things will not happen
 kyonki in sab sawaalon se javabdehi aati he, sawaal kaa jawaab dena mushkil ho jaataa he or ye sab bataane ke liye ankaron ko mehnat kerani pad jaati he

 About a month before the terror attack on the CRPF convoy in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, a senior CRPF officer warned of some flaws in anti-terror training
 counter insergency and anti-teror skool ke pramukh rajnish raay ne siarpief kii training main kuch suvidhaon or khaamiyon ko lekar mukhyalay ko pehle hi kai patr likhe the
 In fact, 40 CRPF personnel were martyred in the Pulwama terror attack

 According to Rajneesh Rai, the syllabus of the institute is unclear
 itnaa hi nahin, yahaan paryaapt trainurs bhi nahin hai or na hi paryaapt infrastracchar hi hai
 In one of the many letters written by ID Rajneesh Rai, he stated that the expenditure incurred in the last few years at the CIAT (counter Insurgency and anti-terror) school in Chittoor without implementing a meaningful training program, shows that public funds Was not used properly
 raay ke anusaar, "kisi bhi behatar parinaam ke bina saarvajanik kharch se prashasnic jadta kii gambhir sthiti utpann hoti he or sarkari khajaane ko baari nuksaan hota he kyonki iskaa koi outkam nikalakar nahin aata
 He further said that no training program is being conducted at CIAT School in Chittoor since May 2017
 raay kaa maananaa tha, unki kaman ke tahat purushon or mahilaon ko niraash kiya ja rahaa tha
 Workers begin to feel that they are within the periphery of the organization, and once they assimilate this kind of emotion, it is very difficult to recover their morale

 In September last year, Rai wrote, "we are currently facing a huge water shortage and the water requirement is being met by only one borewell for about 100 officers / men posted at CIAT School
 ' do maheene baad main unhone likhaa, "bhale hi hamen sabmarsible panpon kii ko lagane athwa ek nae borwell ke nirmaan ko lekar prashikshan nideshaalay se kuch sakaaratmak disha-nirdesh mili hon magar isaki sambhaavna nahin he ki ham is kaam ko samay par puraa kar paaenge

 Aam Aadmi Party convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is campaigning from Goa to Gujarat these days
 aise main kejariwal par sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya wo dilli kii satta se duuri bana rahe hai
 Because at the beginning of the monsoon session of the assembly, he looked completely absent
 chunaav prachaar main jute kejarivaldilli sarkaarka ahm mantralay sambhaal rahe satyendra jain ne pradhanmantri paranishanasadhate hue kaha ki 'arvind kejariwal pradhanmantri narendra modi se sikh rahe hai, hamaare pradhanmantri ko dhai saal ho gaye, wo dilli main nahin rahete hai
 We are at least in the country
 pradhanmantri to videsh main prachaar kar rahe hai jaise unhen antarrashtriya chunaav ladanaa ho
 'kejriwal will go where elections will be held: On the question of Satyendra Jain not attending the assembly session, Satyendra Jain said that' Arvind ji is inside the country, where elections will be held
 ham saare rajyon main to lard nahin rahe hai
 Not even fighting in Uttar Pradesh
 gujarat main jarur ham prachaar karenge
 He was supposed to come from Goa on Monday
 lekin ek mahila kii bekri ko jala diya gaya, to unhen vahaan ruknaa padaa
 We will also tell our work the way the Prime Minister tells you
 'har kaam kii monitering kar rahe hai kejarivashravind kejariwal goa, gujarat or punjab ke chunaav prachaar ke alaava videsh main bhi logon se aam aadmi party se judane kii apil kar rahe hai
 Recently, Kapil Mishra, who has got the responsibility of campaigning in Gujarat, says that 'arvind ji is taking reports of work every day, we are monitoring each and every work
 jis tarah dilli meservindji hamen dekhte hai nirdesh dete hai vaise hi ek din bhi nahin jaataa, jab arvind ji ne kaam kii report na lee ho
 On the question of Arvind Kejriwal campaigning in other states leaving the government in Delhi, Kapil Mishra, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's foreign visit figures were counted
 kapil ne kaha ki 'lagbhag dedh saal main 225 din modi ji videsh main rahe to desh kisne chalaaya? log dilli ke model ko samaj kar kejariwal ko bulaanaa chaahate hai
 Government school fees may be reduced in Delhi, so why not there

 2 days have passed but according to sources, CM was campaigning in Goa till Tuesday morning
 is bich dilli ke up-mukhyamantri manish sisodiya dilli sarkaar kii kaman ko sanbhale hue hai
 Arvind Kejriwal himself has already mentioned that he will stay out of Delhi to strengthen the party's organization in the country
 shaayad yahi badi vajah bhi he ki arvind kejariwal ne dilli sarkaar main koi mantralay apane paas nahin rakhaa hua

 BCCI Acting Secretary Amitabh Chaudhary is also being accused of influencing the election
 ranchi ke rajkumaar or bhartiya cricket ko bulandiyon tak pahunchane vaale mahendra singh dhoni JSCA ke chunaav main apana vot nahin kar paae hai, darasal, dhoni ko JSCA ne member nahin banaakar honorari member banaaya he
 According to the rules, the Honory Member can neither cast his vote in the election nor contest the election
 association main dhoni ne sirf maanad sadsy hone ke kaaran vot nahin diya he, ab is maamle ko lekar sawaal uthne lage hai, adhyaksh pad ke ummidavaar ajay maaru ise sajeesh qaraar de rahe he
 Ajay Maru said there is a well-planned conspiracy to stop the state's biggest player from voting
 unhone kaha ki agar ve is chunaav main jeet jate hai to dhoni ko turant JSCA kaa sadsy banaaenge
 It is natural to raise questions about Dhoni not being made a member of JSCA
 jharkhand ke hi international khiladi saurabh tiwari , varun arun or shahabaaz nadeem JSCA ke sadsy hai or vot daalane bhi aaye, jab ye khiladi sadsy ban sakate he to dhoni kyon nahin, agar dhoni ne khud membership ke liye aavedan nahin diya to desh duniya main naam roshan karne vaale aise khiladi ko membership diya ja saktaa tha
 BCCI Executive Secretary Amitabh Chaudhary faction Presidential candidate Dr Nafeesh Akhtar said that Dhoni will be made a member when he wants to become a member
 nayaa adhyaksh chunane aaye bijepi ke vidhayak biranchi narayan ne bhi kaha ki dhoni ko vot nahin karne kii kami khal rahi he
 The former president of the District Cricket Association and former JSCA member expressed strong reservations about Dhoni not being given voting rights, saying that those who irrigated cricket in Jharkhand have been denied voting
 sidhe-sidhe aarope BCCI ke acting secretary amitabh choudhary par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki ve ranchi main chunaav ke din aakar vot ko prabhavit kar rahe hai
 In this election, 740 members are exercising their vote, but Dhoni, who gives a high place to cricket, is not in it
 dhoni to abtak sadsy kyon nahin banaaya gaya is bare main koi kuch nahin kah rahaa, BCCI ke acting secretary amitabh choudhary media ke saamne aane se bachate rahe
 He too did not say anything in this matter

 prabhas kaa jawaab sunate hi kapil sharma bhi apni hansi nahin roak sake, kyonki wo khud prabhas kaa intervyuu le rahe the
 After Prabhas, Kapil asked Shraddha Kapoor, there is a rumor about you that you get upset before shooting the film? Shraddha said, yes it is true

 70 meter Mudhol seat in Karnataka is one of the major assembly seats
 ye bijepi kii paramparaagat seat maani jaati he
 Govind Karjol is named after bjp's number two leader in the state after BS Yeddyurappa
 ve is seat se vidhayak hai or ek baar phir se bijepi ne unhen chunaav maidan main apana cheharaa banaaya
 The Congress gave the ticket to Satish Chinnapa Bandivaddar from here, while the JD (S) placed a bet on Shankar Naik
 ab dekhne vaali baat yah he ki bijepi is seat ko bachaa paati he yaa phir congress or jedies yahaan se jeet kaa paracham laharaati he
 Other candidates in the Mudhol seat were Arvind Kambli of the Sena, Bhimrao Kalvagol of the Republican Party of India, Ramesh Gonyagol of the Enlightened Republican Party, Baswant Laxman Kambli of the Karnataka State Ryot Union and an Independent candidate from the Mudhol seat
 govind karjol karnataka kii siyasat ke aise netaa hai jinka siyaasi rutaba hi unki jeet kii guarantee rahaa he
 The BJP has a strong hold on this seat
 aise main congress or jedies ke liye is seat par jeetna ek badi chunauti he
 One of the Mudhol region is identified worldwide for its superior breed of hunting dog
 mudhol ke maharaja ne 1900 ke daur main england ke king jorge pancham ko ek jodi shikari kute bhent kiye the
 Mudhol has a very old underground temple of Shiva
 saath hi mudhol yahaan paae jane vaale baarik pattharon ke liye bhi prasiddh he
 Mudhol Assembly seat in Bagalkot district of North Karnataka was reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC) from 1978 to 2008
 parisemen ke baad 2013 main ye saamaanya seat ho gai
 Govind Karjol is identified as the most experienced face of BJP in Karnataka in the beginning of elections on Mudhol seat
 ve bijepi karnataka ikai ke upaadhyaksh hai
 Karjol won the election on 1994 Janata Dal ticket against Congress candidate Ramappa Balappa
 iske baad 1999 ke vidhansabha chunaav main unhen balppa ke haathon shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa, lekin 2004, 2008 or 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet darj kar govind ne is seat ko bijepi kaa majboot durg bana diya
 This time Congress defeated Satish Chinnapa Bandivaddar in place of his old leader Ramappa Balappa to defeat Govind Karjol
 haalanki ramppa balppa tikat maang rahe the
 But the party reposed trust in Satish
 party is ummid main he ki govind karjol ke majboot kile main ve congress kii jeet kaa paracham lahraane main kaamyaab ho sakate hai
 JDS has fielded Shankar Naik from here
 nik 2003 main akhil bhartiya pragatisheel janata dal (eipijedy) kaa daaman chhodkar jedies main aae the
 In such a situation, the party reposed trust in him
 karnataka ke liye teen plan ke saath congress taiyaar, goa-meghalaya kii galati se liya sabakmudholtaluka main badi sankhya main handloom hai, jahaan hastnirmit sari banaai jaati hai
 These sarees are in good demand across the country
 iske alaava mudhol kai chini kaarkaanon ke liye bhi puure rajya main prasiddh he
 The Congress is counting the benefits given to the weavers to surround the BJP, while the JDS is hoping to win through sugarcane farmers

 Gadkari termed the demolition of Samajwadi Party by Rahul Gandhi as a childish act and said that Sonia Gandhi wants to make her son Rahul the Prime Minister of the country, if he becomes Prime Minister then what will this country benefit? Today, they are tearing the paper of another party publicly, they will tear their clothes tomorrow

 Attacking the Samajwadi Party over Muslim reservation, Gadkari said that Mulayam Singh wants to end his community's reservation as well, he is worried about making Akhilesh the chief minister, not the community
 unhone kaha ki kisaanon kaa 58 karod kaa anaaj sad gaya
 Chief Minister Mayawati built parks worth 10 thousand crores, but could not get a cold storage built so that the grains of the farmers are saved
 gadakari ne isse pehle oraiya main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki sonia ke jivan kaa antim lakshya congress mahasachiv va bete rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri bananaa he
 Gadkari said that Congress is a mother-son party and Sonia's ultimate goal is to see Rahul as Prime Minister
 sapa par nishaanaa sadhate hue gadakari ne kaha ki jis tarah congress maa-bete kii party he usee prakaar sapa pita-putr kii party he
 If Sonia is looking to make Rahul the Prime Minister, Mulayam Singh wants to make his son Akhilesh the Chief Minister
 unhone kaha ki congress jahaan dilli luutane main vyast he, vahiin lakhanu kii 'rani' ne pradesh ko jamkar lutaa he
 Corruption and Gundaraj have destroyed the state
 gadakari ne sonia par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki congress ke mantri salmaan khurshid ne kaha tha ki batla house muthbhed ke baad aatankwaadiyon ke shav dekhakar sonia gandhi roi thim

 Thousands of people have been affected by it
 pichley 10 dinon se bihar ke kai hisson main musaladhar barish ho rahi he, jisaki vajah se lagbhag aadha darjan jile baadh kii chapet aa gaye hai
 It is raining continuously in Nepal
 nepal se pani chode jane kii vajah se uttar bihar kii kai nadiyaan ufaan par hai or khatre ke nishaan se upar bah rahi hai
 Dozens of villages in Darbhanga district were submerged as the embankment on Kamala Balan river broke at many places
 isse hajaaron log visthapit ho gaye hai
 People have taken refuge in high places
 bihar sarkaar ne baadh prabhaviton ko surakshit sthanon par pahunchane ke liye state dizaster rispance force (esadiaref) or neshnal dizaster rispance force (andiaref) kii tiimon ke sakriy rahane kaa daawa kiya he
 Rashiyari village of floodplain floodplain Ashyanpur block has been completely submerged
 sthaneey logon ne bataaya ki ravivaar kii subah lagbhag 2 baje kamala balaan par bana tatbandh tut gaya
 Due to this, the water in Rasiyari village started increasing very fast and people had to run to a safe place to save their lives
 baadh kaa pani kai logon kii phoos kii jhopadiyaan baha le gai
 The affected people took their valuables and somehow reached a safe place to save their lives
 sahaayta na milane se aakroshbadh ke vikaraal rup lene ke baavjood sarkari madad nahin pahunch paane ke kaaran logon main aakrosh he
 The affected say that in the elections held 2 months ago, the leaders used to come continuously to seek votes from them, but now, when they need help from the government, there is no one to take care of them
 baandh bachaane kii kavayadakamala balaan nadi main jalastr badhane kii vajah se or bhi kai sthanon par baandh tuutane kii sthiti utpann ho gai he
 The administration has gathered to save the dams in danger, but ordinary citizens are questioning the repairs after the floods, saying that if the officials of the Water Resources Department show the same readiness before the rain, then it would not be possible
 
 dilli ke ramlila maidan main ravivaar ko duniya kaa sabase bada yoga mahotsav hoga
 In this, bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi will also share the stage with yoga guru Swami Ramdev
 yoga mahotsv main baba ramdev ke alaava murari baapu or ramesh bhai ojha ke alaava desh ke kai bade sant shaamil honge
 The yoga festival is being organized to commemorate the martyrdom day of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev
 tamaam sant or modi shaheedon ko shradhanjali denge
 a memorandum will also be presented at the Yoga Festival, in which it will be recommended to give martyr status to the three great men
 ye memorondom raashtrapati ko bheja jayega
 Yoga festival is also important because after the recent news of Baba Ramdev's decision from BJP, Baba Ramdev is sharing the stage with Modi

 to kapil sharma kaa sho band hone ke peeche ye he asli vajah!bataa den ki rajin dhingra ko pehle kapil ke sho kaa creative diarector appoint kiya gaya tha
 But it was said that Rajiv could not control the team
 dedline puri nahin huin
 Script not found ready on time
 isse sho kii quality par asar padaa or tiarapy or bhi zyada gir gai
 It was also said that many people in the team did not like Rajiv at all
 nateeja ye hua ki sho kii puri vyavastha hi charmara gai
 Even more surprising thing is coming out that while most of the people of the team did not want Rajiv in the show, Kapil wanted Rajiv to be the director of the show
 vaise beete dinon ai khabaron kii maane, to sho ke band hone kii vajah khud kapil sharma hi hai
 His health has started deteriorating

 Kitab: Reva Par Se (collection of Poems) Kavayitri: Swati Pandey Nalavadeprakasak: Hind Pair Price: 150 Rupees
 
 The river hums
 
 
 nadiyaan hai to ham hai
 
 
 Rivers tell the story of centuries
 har aadmi ke man main ek nadi he
 Some are dry, some are liquid, but the poems of Swati Pandey Nalawade assure that at least the river flowing in them is a liquid flowing with full ravani
 'reva paar se'aam kavita sangrah nahin, balki yun kahen ek mahila kaa dastavej he
 Groping his time closely, postmorteming relationships, collecting the truth
 
 
 kavitaayen, kabhi kavyitri ke man ke gubaar ko prakat karti hai, to kabhi prem se page bulabulon kii tarah footati hai
 There is also the beauty of Narmada in it, and the same glowing form of this Narmada is also the image of Aksa or the beauty of Reva, but as the search for the river is endless, it is desperate to break the shore and meet the sea
 waisi hi ek adhuri si talash swati kii kavitaaon main bhi dikhti he, lekin ye talash shaayad har stri yaa yun kahen har chetansheel vyakti ke man kii talash he, jo kabhi simal ke ped par ataki raat main prakat hoti he, to kabhi apana pataa duusare ke dil main talashti he
 It is said that poetry is the most mature genre in literature, but at the level of emotion, it is in this mode that the most cashy is true
 aise main nadi se vichoh kaa dardakhub jhalkata he jab 'reva paar se' wo kaatar pukaar lagaati hai
 Perhaps it is the urge to search inside the mind that makes the poet sometimes mention the misty evenings, sometimes to wander behind the clouds, whatever it is, but it is certain that there is hope behind the deep sadness hidden in these poems There are rays
 swati pandey nalavade kaa ye pehla kavita sangrah bhi ummid jagaata he
 Expect to see the beauty of the hidden beauty in the poems, so that it can be sharpened in the next books and in a more sophisticated way and as 'let yourself come light'
 
 'she writes in poetry
 dost!utho, chalate rahone raste talashokhyonkibaharen phir bhi aaengito ummid kiijie nai bahaar kaa kyonki duniya ummid par hi to tiki he or kavitaayen to ummid kaa hi geet hoti hai

 'rabindranath Tagore's words seem very relevant in the present era
 dilli sthit jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay main lagaae gaye kathith deshadrohi naaron ke baad deshbhakti or rashtriyata kii paribhaasha par alag-alag vichaar saamne aa rahe hai
 What is meant by treason in the law is also being highlighted
 aise main yah jaananaa bhi dilachasp hoga ki bharat ke liye aazaadee kii ibaarat likhane vaale mahanayake, jinhone desh kii swatantraaa main kisi na kisi rup se yogadan diya, unki deshbhakti ko lekar kya raay thi
 Rabindranath Tagore, the great poet who wrote the Gitanjali epic and the national anthem 'jana Gana Mana', placed humanity far higher than nationality
 nobel puraskaar vijeta amartya sen ne apni kitaab ‘argumentative Indian’ main tagore sambandhit ek adhyay ‘tagore or unka bharat’ main tagore ke rashtriyata or deshbhakti se jude vichaaron kaa varnan kiya he
 Here are some edited excerpts from the same chapter
 saamaajik kaaryakarta or padri si epa andruyas, mahatma gandhi or tagore ke kareebi mitron main se ek the
 Describing the discussion between these two, Andrews explains - 'both ideas were divided on many issues
 charchaa kaa pehla vishay hota tha murti puja
 Gandhi was in favor of this, as he felt that the public did not deserve to accept any formless, abstract form so soon
 vahiin tagore janata ko hameshaa baccha samajhe jane ke paksh main nahin rahete the
 Gandhi used to give an example of Europe where much was achieved by considering the flag as adorable
 tagore isse sahamat nahin dikhte the
 The second issue was of nationality, Gandhi used to defend it
 vah kehete the ki antarrashtriyata ko hasil karne ke liye rashtriyata se guzaranaa zaruri he
 Just as it is necessary to go through war to achieve peace
 ’ Tagore had great respect for Gandhi, but he used to show the same disagreement on many things to him
 rashtriyata, deshbhakti, saanskrithik vichaaron kii adla badali, tarkshakti aise hi kuch masale the
 In every subject, Tagore's approach was less traditional and more rational, which was related to world welfare
 azaadi se jude andolanon ko tagore kaa puraa samarthan tha, lekin deshbhakti ko lekar unke man main kuch andeh bhi the
 Tagore believed that patriotism prevents us from the freedom to engage with ideas outside the 'char Diwari', while at the same time limiting the freedom to understand the pain and suffering of the people of other countries

 Standard SMS Charges Applicable supreme court ne reliance industries limited ke adhyaksh mukesh ambani ko jed shrenee kii suraksha pradaan karne ke centre sarkaar ke faisle par sawaal uthaate huye kaha ki aise vyaktiyon ko suraksha kyon pradaan kii ja rahi he jabaki aam aadmi khud ko asurakshit mahasoos kar rahaa he
 The court pulled up the government for providing security to such persons and said that due to lack of security in the country, ordinary citizens are unsafe
 court ne kaha ki agar rajdhani main samuchit suraksha hoti to paanch saal kii bacchee se rape nahin hota
 The court said that rich people can take the services of private security personnel
 nyaayamurti ji es singhvi kii adhyakshata vaali khandpeeth ne ambani kaa naam liye bagaiyr hi kaha, ‘hamane akhabaaron main padhaa ki grih mantralay ne ek vyakti ko kendriya audyogic suraksha bal kii suraksha pradaan karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 Why is the government providing protection to such individuals
 ’nyaayadhishon ne kaha, ‘agar unki suraksha ko khatre kaa andeshaa he to unhen nijee surakshakarmiyon kii sevaayen leni chahie
 Security is provided to private traders in Punjab, but now this culture has reached Mumbai
 ’court ne kaha, ‘hamaara kisi vyakti vishesh ko suraksha pradaan karne se koi sarokaar nahin he lekin ham to aam aadmi kii suraksha ko lekar chintit hai
 'this bench made these comments during the hearing on the petition of Uttar Pradesh resident against the security given to the people by the government and misuse of red light vehicles
 isse pehle, ambani ko jed shrenee kii suraksha pradaan karne ke nirnay kii vam dalon dwaara tikhi aalochana ke baad sarkaar ko safai dene padi thi ki yah udyogpati khud hi suraksha kaa kharch vahan karegaa
 According to an estimate, 15 to 16 lakh rupees will be spent on this security every month, which will be calculated based on the salary of the security personnel
 grih mantralay dwaara suraksha ke khatre ke maddenjar sashastr commandon kaa dasta muhaiyaa karaane ke nirnay ke baad yah udyogpati ‘jed shrenee’ kii suraksha praapt karne vaale ativishishti vyaktiyon ke club main shaamil hone vaale naye sadsy hai
 The judges, who are distressed over providing protection to vips on the earnings of the public, said that these individuals will have to consider a new way to assess the danger to the safety of the people on the basis of the security received
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha, ‘yah kya bakawaas he
 This is the wealth of the public
 aam aadmi kii suraksha ke bare main kya he
 The court said that the security provided to the persons facing criminal cases should be withdrawn and the government should take action against those who misused the red light
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha, ‘ek baar aap laal batti roak dijiye, unki aadhi haisiyat khatm ho jaayegi
 Using the red light has now become an identity of status
 yah british kaal jaisaa he
 Earlier, the apex court had said that it would decide whether people other than those in high positions could use red lights and sirens in their vehicles
 court ne kaha tha ki raashtrapati, pradhanmantri, up raashtrapati, adhyaksh, desh ke pradhananyaayadhish or sanvidhanik sansthaaon ke mukhiya tathaa rajyon main aise hi padon par asin vyaktiyon ko to suraksha pradaan kii ja sakati he lekin har vyakti ko laal batti or suraksha kyon? court ne kaha tha ki yahaan tak mukhiya or sarpanch bhi laal batti kii gaadi lekar gum rahe hai

 film rivyuh baing banguector rithik roshan, katrina caff, danni, javed jaafaree, pawan malhotradiarector siddharth anandadurationah 2 ghante 26 minteretin 2kohinoor churaayaa he yaar, kuch to izzat karo
 The protagonist of the movie 'bang Bang', Rajvir, repeatedly tells this thing to the goons
 or ab ham film banane waalon se kah rahe hai
 You are making a remake of 'night and Day'
 rithik katrina kaa hot peyar le rahe ho yaar
 Dude, you are working so hard on action
 kahani kii bhi kuch izzat kar lete
 The film 'bang Bang' is a box of tremendous packaging but poor script, weak acting and dull screenplay
 thode zyada ko kam samajhie
 After the end of the film in the hall, some were seen sleeping, some sleeping
 or baahar ke galiyare main ek bhabhi ji bhaiya ji se yah boltin ki 'samaj hi nahin aayaa, romantic film dikhaa rahe hai ki ection
 Could not do properly
 'kahani jo kahani na ho piek kukhyat aatankwaadi he
 The name is Omar
 vah britain se bharat kii pratyaparn sandhi na ho paae, iske liye kohinoor heere kii chori kaa plan banaata he
 a thief named Rajveer shows this by doing this
 or phir chhuttiyaan bitaane shimla chalaata he
 There, grandmother's beloved Harleen is bursting her forehead at the front desk of the bank
 ghoomani he duniya, magar yahaan ataki he
 And then comes the child of God
 rajvir
 There is a date of misunderstanding with this
 phir gunde-badmaash or bhartiya sikret sarvice ke log harlin ke peeche pad jate hai
 In such a situation, Rajveer does not travel around the world with poor and Harleen, so what to do
 aakhir main pataa chalata he
 Who is rajveer uskaa makasad kya he
 Is he really in love with Harleen? or harlin kya karti he
 Well, to know all this, there is no need to wait till the end
 pehali reel main hi aage kii kahani saaf ho jaati he
 Don't talk about acting, Hrithik Roshan's acting average in the film
 dance ke to vah khuda hai
 Action is also done well
 magar ek cheez hoti he, acting
 Which comes to Hrithik
 magar yahaan najar nahin ai
 And Katrina
 uff tauba
 No matter how much viewers put the story that it was in Canada as a child
 yaa papa euke settle ho gaye the
 Their stagnant Hindi is not available
 katrina ne kamedi karne kii khatarnaak koshish kii he
 Pray to God that you, like me, survive his attack safely
 film ke baaki actor bhi ausat hai
 Weak mimicry sounds actionerthick Katrina looks beautiful in romantic scenes
 magar unke romance ke chakkar main film kii raftaar kii dhanno lag jaati he
 And then Rahi Sahi Kasar completes the intermittent songs
 gane bilashak achche hai, magar ek cheez hoti he sichuation
 Which is forcibly created for these Karnapriya Saptaks
 film kaa ection acha he, magar tukdon main
 For example, the scene of Chase in water strengthens the seat
 isiilie shaayad iskaa istemaal film ke trailor main kiya gaya
 But most of the action scenes seem to be weak imitations of English films
 or car
 He gives our Rohit Shetty brother-in-law a good blow that what someone will compete against
 ajwine si kamedi he bas'baing baing' tom krooj or camerun diaj kii 2010 main ai film 'nite and de' kaa rimek he
 The specialty of that film was action and comedy
 romance tha, magar bas utana hi jitna maayke kii kheer main makhana hota he
 But in Bang Bang, there is a thick oil of romance above the action
 or kamedi to bas ajwine sareekhee ek aadh jagah chipki he
 Obviously, no indigestion can save anyone
 zyaadaatar log film ke aakraamak prachaar se prabhavit hokar or lambey veekend ko sarthak banane ke liye 'baing baing' dekhne jarur jaaenge
 But this is an average regular spice film
 agar aap bahut zyada ummiden lekar ja rahe hai to niraashaa ho sakati he, jaisaa ki aaj ke housephul sho ke baad log laut rahe the
 So my advice is that it is better to avoid the 'bang bang' of your money than to be forcibly seduced

 On Sunday, Sinha said that he has decided to go with the Congress because it is 'truly' a national party and his family friend Lalu Prasad (lalu Prasad) advised him to do the same
 unhone kaha ki trinmul congress pramukh mamata banerjee (mamata Banerjee), samaajawaadee party ke pramukh akhilesh yadav (akhilesh Yadav) or aam aadmi party (AAP) ke rashtriya sanyojak arvind kejariwal (arvind Kejriwal) jaise netaa sahit anya yah chaahate the ki vah unki party main shaamil hon lekin unhone saaf kah diya tha ki sichuation (paristhiti) jo bhi ho lekin chunaav patna sahib se hi ladenge
 The actor-leader had long been critical of the Modi government
 unhone kaha, ‘‘bhaajapa, jisase main lambey samay se judaa tha, use chhodana mere liye ‘peedaadaayak' tha
 but l
 ke
 i was hurt by the way senior party leaders like Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi, Arun Shourie and Yashwant Sinha were treated

 Sinha said that he had won the Patna Sahib seat on his own in 2014 without any support from the party
 unka maananaa he ki is baar vah jeet ke sadanrbh main ‘pehle ke record' ko tod sakate hai
 He criticized the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah in BJP and said that earlier the party had 'lokshahi' and now 'dictatorship'
 unhone kaha, ‘‘hamaare paariwarik mitra (rajd pramukh) lalu prasad ne bhi suzav diya ‘aap vahaan (congress main) jaaen
 'we are there with you and will remain together politically
 yah unki (lalu prasad kii) sahmati or unke saath samjhaute ke tahat hua
 He said that the important factor is that the Patna Sahib seat went to the Congress account in the seat-sharing of the Mahagathbandhan
 unhone kaha bhi tha ki sichuation (paristhiti) jo bhi ho lekin laduunga usee seat se

 All India majlis-e-ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi has accused the BJP and the RSS
 unhone kaha ki bijepi or aresas dalit-muslim mukt bharat bananaa chahta he
 Hindutva ideology is being imposed in the country
 dalit or musalmaan donon is tarah ke prayaason ke khilaaf ekajute hon or kahen ki wo hindutv kii vichaardhaara ko sweekaar nahin karenge
 Owaisi said this at a public meeting in Aurangabad, Maharashtra on Monday
 'sangh parivaar kamajoro ko dabaanaa chahta he'ovaisi ne kaha ki maujuuda daur main musalamaanon or daliton ko jaagruk rahane kii jarurat he
 Because BJP and Sangh Parivar are working to suppress disturbances and weaker sections in the society
 bijepi is desh ko muslim mukt bananaa chaahati hai to vahiin aresas is desh ko dalit mukt bananaa chahta he
 'dalit-muslim unity against the ideology of the Sangh', he said that the ideology of the Sangh Parivar and its mentor Golwalkar, from Hedgewar to Savarkar, is to make Muslims Hindu
 aise main ab jarurat he ki dalit-muslim sangh ke is tarah ke prayaason ke khilaaf ek jute hon or kahen ki wo hindutv ko sweekaar nahin karenge
 Owaisa said time is needed to stop the oppression and discrimination of the Dalit Muslim Ekta Sangh Parivar

 He said that this bill is against Muslim women
 itnaa hi nahin ye samanta ke adhikaar ke bhi khilaaf he, aise doshapurn kanoon kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Giriraj Singh replied to Owaisi's statement, Union Minister Giriraj Singh says that people like Owaisi have a dirty mindset, they work to incite Dalits among Dalits
 unki maansikta main jehar ghulaa hua he or logon main bhi jehar gholne kii koshish karte hai, lekin unka ye makasad kabhi puraa nahin hoga
 What he knows about RSS, he never knew RSS in life
 ye to nafrat failaane vaale log hai jabaki aresas ne samaaj ko jodne kaa kaam kiya
 Not only Dalits, but Muslims also work to provoke Muslims, but the RSS does the work of connecting

 Delhi Police said that due to this, Sreesanth had moved to another hotel

 Acting Chief Justice of Madras High Court Justice Satish k Agnihotri administered him the oath of office and secrecy of Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry at a function held at Raj Bhavan here

 Earlier, on 21 July, the 21st Lt
 Governor of Puducherry, Virendra Kataria was sacked by the Central Government and gave additional weightage to Singh
 shuukravaar subah dilli ravaanaa hue kataaria ne aarope lagaaya tha ki mukhyamantri or mukhya sachiv ke kaaran unhen hataaya gaya
 Chief Secretary b Sanghi termed the charge as unfortunate
 ummid hi to vah bhav he jo sangharshon se jujhane kii prerana detii he
 The whole world rests on hope
 lekhak sanjay sinha kii rachana 'ummid' ham sabhi ke liye ek sabak he ki chaahe kuch ho jaae par ummid kaa daaman mat chhodie
 If the hope is maintained then the destination will definitely be found
 rachana shrinkhalaa main sanjay sinha kii teen rachanaaen 'rishte', 'jindagi' or 'samay' ke baad chauthi kadi he 'ummid'
 Sanjay Sinha's writing speed is very commendable if it is about writing
 anwarat kriyasheel bane rahanaa sanjay sinha kaa junun he or junun bhi isliye ki sanjay kaa lanbaa-chaudaa fasebuk parivaar he
 An incident happens with some member of this family, and Sanjay assimilates her and then starts writing at a rapid pace
 sanjay kaa anubhav chaahe chota ho yaa phir koi badi ghatana kaa unhone har anubhav se yahi siddh karne kii koshish kii he ki ummid kaa diya har haal main jalaae rakho tabhi jindagi kaa tohfa milegaa
 Never let the flowers of hope fade
 aaj kii bhaagti-daudti jindagi or uske akelepan ke dansh ko sanjay ne bahut kareeb se jhela he or dusron kii jindagi main dekha bhi he
 The woman of 'mrs Sonam', despite being a mistress of vast wealth, is alone because her husband does not have time for her
 sanjay sinha ke anusaar 'rishton ke vriksh par tabatak koi fal nahin lagata jabatak ki usamen sneh kii khaad na padi ho
 'the truth is also that the biggest tragedy of the metros is that everyone is alone even while living in a crowd
 yahi akelaapan kabhi-kabhi hamarimansik sthitiko bhi prabhavit karata he
 For some reason, we throw our anger out on someone who has no fault
 'jeet kii haar' sharshak main sanjay ne isi bhav ko vyakt kiya he
 Loneliness, depression breaks a person, and he takes suicide-like steps
 sanjay sinha kii pustak 'ummid' bahut se logon kii jindagi main ujaalaa bhar sakati he
 Sanjay has explained very deep things from small matters
 padhakar palabar ko yahi lagata he ki ham bhi to bahudhaa aisi hi duvidha jhelte hai or kisi se saajha bhi nahin karte
 Still nothing spoiled, hold back hope, save shattered relationships so that someone is with you in loneliness
 aaj vyakti samvednaa shunya ban chukaa he kyonki rishte bhul gaya he
 If there is no relationship then how will you live life? isliye samay kii keemat pahachaaniye or dilon main ummid kaa deepak jalaaiye
 Sanjay Sinha is of course not only a writer but a very sensitive personality
 sanjay kisi kaa bhai banakar uskaa maargdarshan karte hai
 Somewhere the mother's love becomes, then the sister's blessings
 kahin dosti kaa haath badhaakar girte hue ko gale laga lete hai or yaheen gyaanapaksh kii apekshabhaavpakshprabal ho jaataa he
 Sanjay emphasizes the fact that 'the world can only walk on the strength of a gentle heart' and such a statement of the author means something different
 udaahranarth 'jis dhaage kii ganth khul sakati he usapar kanchi nahin chalaani chahie
 Sanjay's statement gives a big message that if we can win the heart of anyone with tenderness, then on the other hand, very harshly our relationship is also torn
 agar apane chaaron ore najar daalen to puri duniya main hinsa, ashishnutaa ko bolbalaa he
 Every person wants to prove himself right and best
 aise maahaul main sanjay sinha kii 'ummid' bahut ummid jagaati he ki log padhenge, mahasoos karenge or apane main badlaav avashya laaenge
 The glands of the mind will open and life will be expected to live to the fullest
 sanjay tabhi to likhte hai ki 'dukhon kii kahani ret par or khushiyon kii kahani pathar par likhie
 Only then will happiness be indelible
 har rishte kii apni ahmiyat hoti he bas jarurat he to samajhadaari or sneh ke sparsh kii
 The author has very easily explained the relationship with parents, children, husband, wife, friends and unknown person on the way
 jivan ke anubhavon se hamen bahut kuch seekhney ko miltaa he
 Especially our elders with experiences that bring us out of trouble
 bas shart yahi he ki ummid kabhi nahin tootni chahie
 'where there is hope, there is life, where there is love, there is the world
 'jaraa apane man ke kone main jhankkar dekhie
 Are you afraid of loneliness and not broken
 apane ghar-parivaar or rishton ko samay dijie
 Find the good in others and recognize the good and power of yourself
 'ranchhod' sheershak ankhen kholane ke liye paryaapt he
 Sometimes intentionally provoking enemies for war so that we get caught in it
 jaise shrakrishna ko jaraasang ne bahut uksaaya parantu shrikrishna ne ranbhumi ko chhod diya or ranchhod kahalaaye
 Through mythology, Sanjay Sinha has made it clear that he should not do any work in a huff
 samajhadaari hi samasya kaa nidaan he
 Relationships are not only about blood but also the introduction of clock two watch keeps us tied like a strong cord that never breaks
 sanjay ne bhale hi apni maa or bhai ko asamay kho diya tha par aaj is takanic ke yug main bhi ham bhav-pravanta se apane naate-rishte jod sakate hai
 This can be learned from Sanjay, who has a wide family on Facebook
 aap bhi akelpan se nikliye or rishton kii jagamagaahat se sarabor ho jaaiye
 Loneliness is our own negative thinking
 soch sakaaratmak ho to anjaan vyakti bhi apana ban jaataa he
 Sanjay Sinha's book 'asha' is welcome
 apane nijee anubhavon se unhone sidd kar diya he ki ham baahar kii chunautiyon se nahin balki apane bheetar kii kamajoriyon se haarate hai
 Open the closed window of the mind, let the rays of hope come in and then see that the Kurukshetra of the mind will not be barren but will become green
 sanjay sinha ko hardik badhai ki vah apane pathakon ke man ke suunepan main 'ummid' kaa prakaash bhar rahe hai
 Waiting for another new experiment of Sanjay, so that Sanjay's experiences will leave an impression on the hearts of his readers

 Akhilesh Yadav while addressing a public meeting in Chandauli on the occasion of the unveiling of the statue of freedom fighter and late former MLA Ganji Prasad said, "the price of diesel has been increased and people will have to see many more such things in the coming days
" ’mukhyamantri ne loksabhaa chunaav main party ko mili karaari haar se hataash kaaryakartaaon kaa manobal badhaane kii niyat se kaha ki haar se himmat haarane kii jarurat nahin he, kyonki party ne hameshaa dharmanirpekshata kii raah par chalakar sampradayikta ke khilaaf sangharsh kiya he or aage bhi karegi

 ’ The third match of the ongoing ODI series between India and South Africa will be played on Wednesday
 bharat abhi series main 2-0 se badhat banaae hue he
 Former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni did not get much opportunity to bat in the first two matches, but he is constantly working for his team while staying behind the wicket
 ab mahendra singh dhoni africa ballebaajon ke liye ek nae plan par kaam kar rahe hai
 Dhoni has been seen practicing quite a bit of wicketkeeping in the nets
 lekin times of india main chhapi ek report kii maane, to south africa main tisare match se pehle dhoni ne wicketcaping kii practice main kaaphi vakt bitaayaa
 Which is a new plan for Dhoni for African batsmen
 iske peeche kai kaaran bataae ja rahe hai
 Since there is a scarcity of water in Africa these days, less water is being used on pitches
 pich main pani kii kami ke kaaran usamen badlaav kii ashanka rahati he
 In such a situation, if the batsman walks, then Dhoni's role behind the wicket increases
 haal hi main africa team ke ballebaaji coach del kaa maananaa he ki africa ballebaaj bhartiya spinneron ko khilne ke liye alag tareeke ke plan par kaam kar rahe hai
 For this, many local spinner bowlers were also called in practice
 unhone kaha ki ham koshish karenge ki gend ko spin hone se pehle hi roka jaae, yani ballebaaj pich par aage badhkar bhartiya spinneron kaa saamana karenge
 In such a situation, this master plan of Dhoni can prove to be right for Team India

 The Aam Aadmi Party has once again shocked Kumar Vishwas
 vishwaas ko rajasthan ke prabharee pad se hataa diya gaya he
 On this, a statement has come from Kumar Vishwas's office
 vahiin vishwaas ne do twit kiye hai jinamein kavita kii panktiyon ke jariye waar kiya he
 a statement issued from Kumar Vishwas's office said that such removal clearly meant that the party had not given the Rajasthan charge to Kumar Vishwas as part of any political strategy, but at the time of conspiracy on the Amanatullah case
 This decision was forced to avoid the fear of busting and the resentment of the activists
 bayaan main kaha gaya ki hamen media kii taraf se madhyam se soochna mili ki dow kumaar vishwaas ko rajasthan prabharee pad se bharmukt kar diya gaya he
 No information has been provided by the party in this regard, the party's statement also said that the decision was taken after a long meeting of the PAC
 daftar ke bayaan main kaha gaya he ki aisi kisi bhikhfachhki soochna kumaar vishwaas ko nahin mili, jabaki wo PAC sadsy hai
 If a member of the PAC is not informed, then how is the quorum of the PAC fulfilled? Apart from the office statement, Kumar Vishwas also tweeted after the decision came
 vishwaas ne do twit kiye jinamein kavitaaon kii panktiyon ko twit kiya
 We do the word-dynasty, to tell the truth, our own generation, that generation of Kabir who is not afraid of babu-akbar, not afraid of worship, these conspiratorial aura does not pay for Sevani; Found what the inscription used to be, what was found by making a newspaper? 😳👎 https: / / t

 co / mbg1wvgkj0— Dr Kumar Vishvas (@drkumarvishwas) April 11, 2018 What did the party say? The Aam Aadmi Party said that the party had sent Deepak Vajpayee to visit Rajasthan in the past
 ab wo vahiin rahete hai or puure rajya kaa daura kar chuke hai
 After which they are being given the responsibility of the state
 aapako bataa den ki kumaar vishwaas se ab rajasthan ke prabharee kaa pad waapas le liya gaya he

 After several years, mango production has decreased in Uttar Pradesh this year
 har saal may maah ke antim dinon main dashahari aam bazaar main dikhaai dene lagata tha, lekin is saal june maah main bazaar main aayega
 In fact, according to the Department of Horticulture and Food Processing, the production of mangoes including Dussehri is likely to be 15 to 20 lakh tonnes, which is less than half of the production done every year
 is bare main aam utpaadan sangh ke adhyaksh tathaa rashtriya udyaan board ke nideshak isram ali kaa kahana he ki is saal aam kaa utpaadan pichley saal hue utpaadan kaa 40 pratishat he
 He said that Dussehari mango is likely to come in the market by June 10, the price of which will not be less than Rs 50 per kg
 isram ali ne kaha ki kharaab mausam tathaa aam ke pedo main keede lagane se utpaadan par asar padaa he
 The mango crop was affected due to severe cold and less rain in the previous season
 yah sirf dashahari kaa hi maamla nahin, balki aam kii anya kismon kaa bhi yahi haal he
 Due to inclement weather, mango trees did not have enough views this year
 puri tarah se pani nahin mil paane ke kaaran utpaadak pedo kii thik se sinchai nahin kar paae
 Ali also complains of not getting any assistance from the state government and regrets the irregular supply of electricity
 unka kahana he ki rajya sarkaar se aam utpaadakon ko kisi tarah kii raaj sahaayta sabsidi nahin milti he
 13 percent state aid is given to mango exporters, which is quite low
 ali kehete hai ki is saal puure desh main aam kaa utpaadan kam hua he, chaahe maharashtra kaa alphonso ho yaa andhra pradesh main paidaa hone vaala aam

 haryana ke varisht iees adhikari ashok khemka in dinon apane tabadale ko lekar charchaa main bane hue hai
 Khemka, sent to the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs, has been welcomed by Minister Anil Vij
 haryana ke varisht mantri vij ne is bare main puche jane par kaha, khub jamegi jodi jab mil baithenge do yaar
 Actually, Khemka has an old relationship with Anil Vij
 isse pehle vij jab vigyaan evam praudyogiki mantri the, to khemka unke vibhaag main pradhan sachiv ke pad par tainaat the
 Vij has also previously stood by Ashok Khemka on a number of issues
 bataa den ki khemka kaa naam saal 2012 main us samay charchaa main aayaa tha, jab unhone congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke damaad rabart wadra kii company or real estate company dlef ke bich hue jameen saude ko radd kar diya tha
 Khemka has earned a lot of name for his honesty, but he has also had to bear the brunt of it many times
 ashok khemka dwaara ujagar gadabadiyon or aniyamittaaon ke chalate haryana kii bhaajapa sarkaar ke teen mantriyon se unka takaraav ho chukaa he
 Perhaps this is the reason that this officer of the last 1991 batch was transferred for the 51st time in a career of 24 years
 kuch log jahaan anil vij ke saath khemka ke naate par dhyaan dilaate hue unke tabadale ko unke kariyar ke lihaaj ke acha bataa rahe hai, lekin khemka ise lekar zyada khud nahin dikhe
 After this order of Haryana Government, Ashok Khemka also expressed his pain on Twitter
 unhone likhaa, 'dher sara kaam karne kii yojana thi, lekin ek or tabadale kii khabar mili
 Crash landing again
 nijee hit jeet gaye, lekin yah asthaayee he

 uttar pradesh main jis samay saare raajnneetik dal prachaar or pratyaashiyon ke chayan main lage hai, samaajawaadee party apane vivaadon main uljhi nazar aa rahi he
 Dengue continues to wreak havoc in the country
 dengue ke dank ne logon ko bebas kar diya he
 New cases of dengue are coming out every day
 pichley kuch saal se dengue jis tarah fail rahaa he vah chintaa kii baat he
 In August and September, this disease starts showing its effect
 har saal kii tarah is saal bhi dengue kii vajah se kai jaane ja chuki hai
 Go to any hospital in Delhi, dengue will be seen in a havoc
 bukhaar hote hi log ghabaraakar aspataal pahunch jate he
 Since 2006, this disease is killing many people every year
 pichley paanch saal main is beemaari kii vajah se 850 se bhi zyada logon kii maut ho chuki he
 These figures are official, in reality more people would have died
 san 2006 main jab yah beemaari shuru hui tab desh main 50 log iske shikaar hue the
 In 2009, dengue killed 80 people
 har saal yah aankada badhata ja rahaa he
 In 2012, maximum 242 people died due to this
 main isliye yah aankade de rahaa hum kyonki ham sabhi jaanate hai ki roj hamaare desh main kaise aankadon kii raajnneeti hoti rahati he
 From the center to the state government keeps on presenting its development figures, but the rising numbers of dengue effects point towards the lagging health services
 har saal agar dengue kii vajah se maut bad rahi hai to iskaa matlab yahi he ki kahin na kahin hamaari sarkaar fail hui he, chaahe vah rajya sarkaar ho yaa centre sarkaar
 We have managed to stop the enemy of the country but have not been able to stop the mosquito of dengue
 dengue ko lekar rajaneta roj siyasat kii pari khel rahe hai
 Whatever happens, our politicians are never going to come out of their action
 dengue kii vajah se logon kii maut ho rahi he, lekin rajnatik dal ise lekar ek duusare par keechad phenkane main jute hai
 You can see how Aam Aadmi Party and BJP are fighting each other in Delhi
 maut kaa matam bhi hamaare rajanetaaon ko badal nahin paaya he
 The BJP, which has taken over the MCD, says that the Aam Aadmi Party government has cut its health budget this year, due to which it has not been able to stop dengue
 lekin emsidi par to bijepi ke kabza 2007 se he, jabaki dengue ke vajah se logon kii mautein har saal hui hai
 Was there still a budget problem? udhar dilli sarkaar bhi dilli ke is haal ke liye emsidi ko jimmedaar tehra rahi he
 Delhi government says it is the job of MCD to keep Delhi clean and take care of public health
 dengue ke machharon ne congress ko bhi neend se jagaa diya he
 Many big leaders of the Congress also sat in front of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's house and were shouting slogans like 'kejriwal senses come'
 congress aisa bartaav kar rahi he ki jaise congress ke raaj main kabhi dengue kii vajah se maut nahin hui thi
 From 2006 to 2013, the Congress was in Delhi and during this period, deaths due to dengue continued every year
 tab bhi congress or bijepi ek-duusare par keechad phenk rahe the
 If left this year, Delhi had the highest number of deaths in 2010 and 2011
 in donon saalon main dengue se dilli main aath -aath logon kii mautein huin
 The comments lekin phir bhi main maanata hum ki dilli kii sarkaar kahin na kahin is baar dengue rokane main vifal hui he
 So far 20 people have died in Delhi due to dengue
 dengue koi nai beemaari nahin he, sarkaar ko pataa tha ki har saal is beemaari se logon kii mautein hoti hai, lekin phir bhi sarkaar ne isko rokane ke liye samay rahete koi thos kadam nahin uthaaya
 When children started dying due to dengue, the government came into action
 dilli kii sarkaar apane kaam kaa hisaab vigyaapan ke jariye logon tak pahunchati rahatu he lekin dengue jaisi beemaari ko kaise roka jaae, iske liye koi khaas vigyaapan nahin hai
 People also have to take care of themselves
 sarkaar kii jimmedaari maanakar apni jimmedaari bhul janaa galat he
 It is also the responsibility of the people to keep their area clean
 dengue failaane vaale machhar ghar ke aasapaas jamaa pani main paidaa hote hai
 It is necessary to keep medicine and cleanliness wherever water has accumulated
 jab bhi dengue ke lakshan jaise tej bukhaar,sharir par laal-laal chakatte dikhaai dena,puure badan main tej dard hona,ulti hona ,chakkar aana jaise lakshan dikhaai de rahaa ho to turant aspataal janaa chahie or dengue kii jaanch karaani chahie
 Dengue is tested in every government hospital
 jo log EWS kota main aate hai vah privet aspataal main bhi kam paise main ilaaj kara sakate hai
 If there is any problem related to the treatment of dengue, then you can contact the government helpline number 1031
 jab aapke netaa nahin badal rahe hai to khud apane aapako badal lijie or apana khyaal khud rakhie
 When the disease started in 2006, 50 people died in the country
 san 2009 main dengue ne 80 logon kii jaan lee
 This figure keeps increasing every year
 san 2012 main sabase zyada 242 logon kii isse maut hui
 i am giving this data because we all know how the politics of statistics continues in our country every day
 centre se lekar rajya sarkaar tak apane vikaas kii aankade pesh karti rahati hai lekin dengue ke asar ke badhate aankade pichhadati swasthya sevaaon kii ore hi ishaara karte hai
 Every year if deaths due to dengue are increasing, it means that our government has failed somewhere, be it the state government or the central government
 ham desh ke dushman ko rokane main to kaamyaab hue hai lekin dengue ke machhar ko rokane main kaamyaab nahin hue hai
 Politicians are playing an innings of politics every day regarding dengue
 kuch bhi ho jaae hamaare rajaneta apni harakat se kabhi baahar nahin aane vaale hai
 People are dying due to dengue, but political parties are busy throwing mud at each other
 aap dekh sakate hai, dilli main aam aadmi party or bijepi kaise ek duusare se lard rahi hai
 Even the weeds of death have not changed our politicians
 emsidi par kabza karne vaala bijepi kaa kahana he ki aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne is saal uske health bajet main katautee kar di he jisaki vajah se vah dengue ko rokane main kaamyaab nahin ho paa rahi he
 But the MCD has been occupied by the BJP since 2007, while deaths due to dengue have occurred every year
 kya tab bhi bajet kii samasya thi? On the other hand, the Delhi government is also blaming the MCD for this situation in Delhi
 dilli sarkaar kaa kahana he dilli ko saaf-suthra rakhana or jan swasthya kaa dhyaan rakhana emsidi kaa kaam he
 Dengue mosquitoes have also woken the Congress from sleep
 congress ke kai bade netaa dilli ke mukhyamantri aravind kejariwal ke ghar ke saamne dhaaraney par bhi baith gaye the or is dauraan 'kejariwal hosh main aao' jaise naare laga rahe the
 Congress is behaving as if there was never a death due to dengue during the Congress rule
 san 2006 se lekar 2013 tak dilli main congress kii sarkaar thi or is dauraan har saal dengue kii vajah se mautein hoti raheen
 Even then Congress and BJP were throwing mud at each other
 agar is saal ko chhod diya jaae to 2010 or 2011 main dilli main sabase zyada mautein hui thim
 Eighty-eight people died in Delhi due to dengue in both these years
 tippaniyan But still i believe that the government of Delhi has failed to stop dengue somewhere this time
 abhi tak dengue kii vajah se dilli main 20 logon kii maut ho chuki he
 Dengue is not a new disease, the government knew that every year people die from this disease, but still the government did not take any concrete steps to stop it in time
 jab dengue kii vajah se bacchon kii maut hone lageen tab sarkaar harakat main ai
 The government of Delhi is keeping track of its work to reach people through advertisements but there is no special advertisement for how to prevent the disease like dengue
 logon ko bhi apana dhyaan khud rakhana padegaa
 It is wrong to forget your responsibility by assuming responsibility of the government
 apane ilaake ko saaf-suthra rakhana logon kii bhi jimmedaari he
 Dengue-spread mosquitoes breed in water stored around the house
 jahaan bhi pani jamaa hua he us par dawaai daalana or safai rakhana jaruri he
 Whenever symptoms of dengue such as high fever, red rash appear on the body, severe pain in the whole body, vomiting, dizziness, then one should go to the hospital immediately and check for dengue
 dengue kaa test har sarkari aspataal main hota he
 Those who fall in the EWS quota can also get treatment in private hospitals for less money
 yadi dengue ke ilaaj ko lekar koi samasya aa rahi he to sarkaar kii helpline number 1031 par sampark kar sakate hai
 When your leaders are not changing, then change yourself and take care of yourself
 main isliye yah aankade de rahaa hum kyonki ham sabhi jaanate hai ki roj hamaare desh main kaise aankadon kii raajnneeti hoti rahati he
 From the center to the state government keeps on presenting its development figures, but the rising numbers of dengue effects point towards the lagging health services
 har saal agar dengue kii vajah se maut bad rahi hai to iskaa matlab yahi he ki kahin na kahin hamaari sarkaar fail hui he, chaahe vah rajya sarkaar ho yaa centre sarkaar
 We have managed to stop the enemy of the country but have not been able to stop the mosquito of dengue
 dengue ko lekar rajaneta roj siyasat kii pari khel rahe hai
 Whatever happens, our politicians are never going to come out of their action
 dengue kii vajah se logon kii maut ho rahi he, lekin rajnatik dal ise lekar ek duusare par keechad phenkane main jute hai
 You can see how Aam Aadmi Party and BJP are fighting each other in Delhi
 maut kaa matam bhi hamaare rajanetaaon ko badal nahin paaya he
 The BJP, which has taken over the MCD, says that the Aam Aadmi Party government has cut its health budget this year, due to which it has not been able to stop dengue
 lekin emsidi par to bijepi ke kabza 2007 se he, jabaki dengue ke vajah se logon kii mautein har saal hui hai
 Was there still a budget problem? udhar dilli sarkaar bhi dilli ke is haal ke liye emsidi ko jimmedaar tehra rahi he
 Delhi government says it is the job of MCD to keep Delhi clean and take care of public health
 dengue ke machharon ne congress ko bhi neend se jagaa diya he
 Many big leaders of the Congress also sat in front of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's house and were shouting slogans like 'kejriwal senses come'
 congress aisa bartaav kar rahi he ki jaise congress ke raaj main kabhi dengue kii vajah se maut nahin hui thi
 From 2006 to 2013, the Congress was in Delhi and during this period, deaths due to dengue continued every year
 tab bhi congress or bijepi ek-duusare par keechad phenk rahe the
 If left this year, Delhi had the highest number of deaths in 2010 and 2011
 in donon saalon main dengue se dilli main aath -aath logon kii mautein huin
 The comments lekin phir bhi main maanata hum ki dilli kii sarkaar kahin na kahin is baar dengue rokane main vifal hui he
 So far 20 people have died in Delhi due to dengue
 dengue koi nai beemaari nahin he, sarkaar ko pataa tha ki har saal is beemaari se logon kii mautein hoti hai, lekin phir bhi sarkaar ne isko rokane ke liye samay rahete koi thos kadam nahin uthaaya
 When children started dying due to dengue, the government came into action
 dilli kii sarkaar apane kaam kaa hisaab vigyaapan ke jariye logon tak pahunchati rahatu he lekin dengue jaisi beemaari ko kaise roka jaae, iske liye koi khaas vigyaapan nahin hai
 People also have to take care of themselves
 sarkaar kii jimmedaari maanakar apni jimmedaari bhul janaa galat he
 It is also the responsibility of the people to keep their area clean
 dengue failaane vaale machhar ghar ke aasapaas jamaa pani main paidaa hote hai
 It is necessary to keep medicine and cleanliness wherever water has accumulated
 jab bhi dengue ke lakshan jaise tej bukhaar,sharir par laal-laal chakatte dikhaai dena,puure badan main tej dard hona,ulti hona ,chakkar aana jaise lakshan dikhaai de rahaa ho to turant aspataal janaa chahie or dengue kii jaanch karaani chahie
 Dengue is tested in every government hospital
 jo log EWS kota main aate hai vah privet aspataal main bhi kam paise main ilaaj kara sakate hai
 If there is any problem related to the treatment of dengue, then you can contact the government helpline number 1031
 jab aapke netaa nahin badal rahe hai to khud apane aapako badal lijie or apana khyaal khud rakhie
 Politicians are playing an innings of politics every day regarding dengue
 kuch bhi ho jaae hamaare rajaneta apni harakat se kabhi baahar nahin aane vaale hai
 People are dying due to dengue, but political parties are busy throwing mud at each other
 aap dekh sakate hai, dilli main aam aadmi party or bijepi kaise ek duusare se lard rahi hai
 Even the weeds of death have not changed our politicians
 emsidi par kabza karne vaala bijepi kaa kahana he ki aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne is saal uske health bajet main katautee kar di he jisaki vajah se vah dengue ko rokane main kaamyaab nahin ho paa rahi he
 But the MCD has been occupied by the BJP since 2007, while deaths due to dengue have occurred every year
 kya tab bhi bajet kii samasya thi? On the other hand, the Delhi government is also blaming the MCD for this situation in Delhi
 dilli sarkaar kaa kahana he dilli ko saaf-suthra rakhana or jan swasthya kaa dhyaan rakhana emsidi kaa kaam he
 Dengue mosquitoes have also woken the Congress from sleep
 congress ke kai bade netaa dilli ke mukhyamantri aravind kejariwal ke ghar ke saamne dhaaraney par bhi baith gaye the or is dauraan 'kejariwal hosh main aao' jaise naare laga rahe the
 Congress is behaving as if there was never a death due to dengue during the Congress rule
 san 2006 se lekar 2013 tak dilli main congress kii sarkaar thi or is dauraan har saal dengue kii vajah se mautein hoti raheen
 Even then Congress and BJP were throwing mud at each other
 agar is saal ko chhod diya jaae to 2010 or 2011 main dilli main sabase zyada mautein hui thim

 What i have done in these three years, i would not have been able to take 10 thousand births

 Uma Bharti said that now there is no need for movement for Toganga nor for Ram temple
 ab sabhi logon ko maahaul banane kii jarurat he
 All parties should unite in the name of Ram temple, so that BJP does not get votes in the name of Ram
 lekin mandir nirmaan main ghaat na lagaao

 a post shared by Tiger Shroff (@tigerjackieshroff) on Jul 14, 2018 at 12:10am PDT Traveling by air used to be a glamor and the governments were proud of their 'national' airlines, at a time when the name of Air India came into being, as a legacy nationalist sentiments began to boom
 is desh kaa madhyavarg air india ko loktantric bharat ke mukut main jade heere se kam nahin samajhataa tha
 But things have changed
 tab se lekar ab tak kai vimaanan companiyaan ug ai hai or pashchimi duniya main rashtriya vimaan seva jaisi cheez apraasangik ho chali he
 Despite this, national airlines like countries such as Singapore, United Arab Emirates (UAE) have an identity
 phir air india par itnaa bavaal kyon? yah baat samaj main nahin aati jabaki sarkaar baar-baar kasam khaati he ki vah 'aam aadmi' ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 After all, what did the Prime Minister mean in his Independence Day address in 2009 that he would not allow Air India to drown? After all, what are the concerns that Air India was engaged in as a public undertaking? Did the Prime Minister find it necessary to mention it? Anyway, the previous government had decided to privatize Air India in 2001 (with the full support of all the unions) which in the end failed despite the whole process
 yadi aisa ho jaataa, to sarkari kuprabandhan ke jaal main fansi yah company aaj behatar haal main hoti
 So far, the decision by the UPA government not to privatize Air India is inconceivable, while the process of selling public enterprises continues
 upie main ek purv naagarik uddyan mantri ne, jinhen kai log ab tak is mahakme kaa sabase kaabil mantri samajhate hai, daawa kiya tha ki unki bhoomika na to baari sankhya main vimaanon kii kharid kaa order dene main thi (jo mul prastaav se kahin zyada the), na hi donon sarkari airlinon ke vilay ke faisle main thi, kyonki ye faisle neeche se aae the jinhen baad main cabinet kii manjuuri mili
 Many people do not accept this fact even though the current minister has accepted the merger as a mistake
 air india kaa ateet kaaphi shandaar rahaa he
 Excluding the recent capital investment (which has been increasing), the government spent Rs
 154 crore in its original tenure of six decades
 ke nivesh ke alaava kuch nahin kiya
 In the early years the company made a good profit, built assets in Mumbai and abroad, bought hotels and built hangars and staff quarters with its own money
 magar pichley kuch varshon ke dauraan laagat ko puraa karne ke liye in parisampattiyon ko bechaa ja chukaa he
 However, the current debt is $ 10 billion (ie Rs 50,000 crore)
 ) yaa usase zyada bhi ho saktaa he (jo mukhyatah sarkari guarantee vaala paisa he)
 The story of this collapse began in 2005 when heavy orders were placed for Air India with 111 (67 long-haul) and 44 for Indian Airlines
 isaki parinti 2007 main hui jab mantrisamooh or cabinet ne donon companiyon kaa neshnal aviation company main vilay karne kaa faisla kiya
 While the merger process was not completed properly, there were frequent changes in the top management

 Japan Airlines (JAL) is the best recent example of how an airline can approach the floor just by adopting and implementing policy measures
 nau maheene pehle jab 78 varshiya chairman kajuo inamori ne jaal kii kaman sanbhali thi, to is company ko biimaar ghoshit kar diya gaya tha
 Company 25
 6 arab dollar ke karj ke boj tale apane diwalia hone kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 The root of the losses and the heavy army of workers contributed to this
 japan ke is sabase mashhoor udhyami ne airline kii kismat palat di or aaj company munafv main he
 In the same way, Satyam Computers had the biggest scam in the country, but Tech Mahindra acquired the company (now Mahindra Satyam) and the company with a loss of $ 2 billion in 2008-09, Rs 2,500 crore in the first half of 2009-10 
 ke munaafe main aa gai
 In contrast, in the case of Air India, the government put some industrialists and a retired Air Chief Marshal on board
 lekin ve kuch khaas badlaav nahin kar sake
 Within six months, the foreign professionals appointed were shown the way back out
 sawaal uthta he ki sarkaar agar air india ko nahin bechnaa chaahati, tab bhi usne isaki kaman nijee prabandhan ko kyon nahin lene di? srilanka kaa udhaaharan yahaan kaam aayega
 In 1998, 40 per cent of the government-owned 100 per cent Sri Lankan airline was sold to Emirates Airlines
 ghate main chal rahi srilankai vimaanan seva ke prabandhan kaa puraa adhikaar emirates ko mil gaya
 The government has now withdrawn that stake and the airlines are in good health
