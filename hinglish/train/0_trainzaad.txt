 Since the formation of the Modi government at the Center, the Congress party has been witnessing defeat in consecutive assembly elections
 har vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ke baad congress daftar main sannata pasra rahata tha, lekin aaj kaa najaara bilkul ulat he
 The view that was seen in the Congress headquarters till now is seen in the BJP headquarters
 yahaan na koi netaa he na kaaryakarta, jashn to dur kii baat he
 Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh's trends are not less than a shock for the BJP, which has won the assembly elections continuously
 ek to 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav sir par he, doosraa in teenon kii rajyon main bijepi kii sarkaar thi, jahaan ab singhaasana jaataa dikh rahaa he
 After every victory in the election, a victorious march was taken out to welcome party president Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the leaders were welcomed after wreathing
 lekin is baar sab suunaa he
 This time it is neither victory nor any leader who takes credit for victory
 jeet ke baad press conference kar 'congress mukt bharat' ke naare ko buland karte hue amit shah bijepi jeet kaa jashn manaate the
 But this time he did not even comment on the media questions related to trends in the Parliament complex and went without saying anything
 haalanki party ke pravaktaaon ko ab bhi ummid he ki bijepi madhya pradesh or rajasthan main sarkaar bana sakati he, haalanki congress ne chhattisgarh ko sweep kiya he
 This time the view of the Congress office was exactly the opposite
 mukhyalay ke baahar rakhe party ke jhande, baij or postaron kii bikri main achaanak ijapha ho gaya he
 Activists coming to celebrate outside the party office bought the party's promotional materials hands-on, which makes the vendors of these goods very happy
 ek vikreta ne bataaya ki saal 2014 main bijepi kii jeet ke baad congress daftar ke baahar aise jashn ke maukey kam hi aae hai
 Activists and supporters gathered outside the party office believe that with the victory of these three states, Rahul Gandhi is set to become the Prime Minister in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and the Congress party will defeat the BJP in the upcoming elections
 daftar ke baahar jamaa samarthakon kaa kahana he ki bijepi ne vikaas ke naam par janata kaa vot liya lekin unke agenda main sampradayikta or samaaj ko ladaana shaamil tha
 On the trends, party MP and Mahila Congress president Sushmita Dev said that Congress party workers need to be restrained by this victory and the party will work harder
 unhone kaha ki hamen jeet kaa bharosa tha or agsit pols main bhi congress party ko jeet milti dikhaai gai thi
 Let us tell you that in the trends of three states, Congress is looking to gain in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh
 rajasthan main congress sabase badi party ban rahi he to vahiin chhattisgarh main party bahumat ke aankade ko baari antar se paar karti najar aa rahi he
 The contest of Madhya Pradesh is quite interesting and no party seems to be getting majority here, although BJP is definitely emerging as the largest party
 notebandi ke kaaran har ore afra-tafari kaa maahaul he, saath hi nayaa maheenaa shuru hone se logon ko selary lene main bhi dikkat kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 One such case has come up from Pune where Sithinya Galande who is a teacher by profession is facing difficulties for salary
 yun to sithinyaa notebandi ke faisle kaa samarthan karti he lekin vah kehete he ki isko lagu karne main sarkaar vifal rahi he
 Always keeps a checkbook, Sathithinya says that while going to school, she has to carry a checkbook with her, there is an ATM on the way but no one has cash and where there is a lot of crowd
 aaj maheene kaa pehle din hone ke kaaran sabhi ko paise dene the isi kaaran guruuvar ko skool pahunchate hi sithinyaa ne principal ke offis kaa rukh kiya jahaan pahunchate hi unhone aadhe din kii chuttee maangi, kyonki unhenbankjakar paise nikaalane he or ghar kii naukaraani, press vaale or doodhwaale ko paise dene hai
 It is worth mentioning that due to salary day, there is a lot of people in banks and shortage of money, due to which people are facing problems
 aam aadmi party ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki vah narendra modi ke netritv vaali centre sarkaar ke saath kisi tarah kii takaraar nahin karegi, balki uske saath har kadam par sahyog karegi
 AAP candidate from Greater Kailash Assembly seat Saurabh Bhardwaj said, 'our strategy will be to cooperate with the central government
 ' unhone kaha ki unki party or sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne chunaav ke liye puri taiyaari kii thi or janata ne unhen isliye vot diya, kyonki vah maujuuda vyavastha se tang aa chuki he or badlaav chaahati he
 He said, 'we are with the public
 ' bharadwaj se yah puche jane par ki party kii is baari jeet kii vajah kya rahi, unhone kaha, 'janata ne hamaare 49 dinon ke shashan or centre main bijepi ke aath-nau maheenon ke shashan kii tulana kii or unhen laga ki bijepi sirf ek vishesh varg ko khush karne main lagi he, isliye unhone hamen mauka dene kaa faisla kiya
 On the question asked about bjp's Chief Ministerial candidate Kiran Bedi, Bhardwaj said, "we want him to win from his seat so that we can join the assembly
" ' haalanki kiran bedi apane nirvachan kshetra krishna nagar se chunaav haar gai hai

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is again on a tour of Gujarat within 15 days
 jahaan pichhali baar rahul gandhi ke mandir jane or vahaan puja archana karne kii khabar surkhiyon main rahi, to is baar unke dance karne kii khabar surkhiyaan bato rahi he
 In general, Rahul Gandhi is rarely seen in a happy mood in public
 mangalvaar korahul gandhigujrat ke chota udaipur main timali dance main hissaa liya or adivaasiyon ke saath jamkar thirake
 He was seen dancing to the beat of the drum, the video of which is becoming very viral

 Enthusiasts are keen on the elections to be held in Gujarat
 jahaan ek ore bijepi apni satta bachaane ke liye ji jaan laga rahi he, to duusari ore congress apane do dashak ke satta vanvaas ko khatm karne ke liye betaab he
 Though the Gujarat Assembly elections have not been formally announced yet, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is in the process of defeating the BJP only with the weapon of Hindutva politics
 yahi vajah he ki saurashtra ke baad ab madhya gujarat main bhi rahul gandhihindu dharm ke ird-girdahi ghoomte najar aa rahe hai
 Along with visiting Rahul Gandhi temple at the time of Gujarat tour, he is also seen to have Tripund and Tika on his forehead during his speech
 sirf rahul hi nahin piem modi bhi lagaataar mandiron kaa daura kar rahe hai
 If we look at the last few months, it seems as if there is a competition between Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi to reach the temples
 or ho bhi kyon nahin
 Perhaps Rahul has also realized that BJP has been winning Gujarat elections continuously since 1995

 It is being said that after preparing the original question paper in English, the paper setter puts it in Google translation

 kya sangh lok seva ayog itnaa aksham he ki vah das panktiyon kaa bhi thik se anuwaad nahin kar saktaa
 Devendra Singh says that in the time limit of 120 minutes, the candidate first read the wrong Hindi and if they do not understand then read the question in English, then correct the mistakes of the Commission and then think of the appropriate answer to the question

 In my mind all the things done years ago are repeated once again
 ek din mere dadaji ne mujhe muskuraate hue dekha or dua maangi ki meri shaadi ek achche ghar main ho jaae or meraa haal jugnu khala jaisaa na ho
 When i asked him the meaning of this thing, he started saying good and bad about Khala's husband
 ek pir ne barbaad kii jugnu kii jindagisaalon baad jab dadaji duniya main nahin rahe, tab ek din mere abbu jugnu khala ke shuhar par bigadane lage or meri ammi ne unhen chup rahane kaa ishaara kiya
 Abbu did not listen to Ammi and said that Pir ruined the life of Jugnu
 jugnu ko apane hisaab se sabmisive banane ke chahat rakhane vaale unke shuhar unhen ek pir ke paas le gaye
 The Pir stopped eating Khala and advised him to have a relationship with Khala in the cemetery
 khala ke pagal shuhar ne kabristaan main unkarepakia, par khala shuhar kii 'behatar begum' na ban saki
 To pacify the husband of Jugnukhala who was with Pir for a week, Pir asked to leave Jugnu Khala to himself for a week and Khala's husband agreed to do so
 ek hafte baad jugnu khala apane shuhar ke hisaab se 'behatar begum' ban chuki thi, jinke saath wo kuch bhi kar sakate thea
 In the language of doctors, i was a victim of depression
 khala kii haalat or bhi kharaab ho gai, jab parivaar ne bhi unki madad karne se inkaar kar diya
 This matter remains in the family, so no one is allowed to know these things outside
 ghar se bhaag ai thim khalamem us vakt paanch saal kii thi, jab meri jugnu khala apane ghar se bhagkar ai thi
 Khala's condition was so bad that she could not even stand upright and her body had turned pale
 ghar ke logon ne unhen kisi tarah bistar par leta diy or wo behosh ho gai
 Suddenly Khala started shouting 'baba-baba' and crying while saying that Baba had not taken them
 sabhi ne unhen bataaya ki vahaan koi baba nahin he
 When my khala saw me, kissed my forehead and promised my mother to take care of me forever
 khala ro raheen thim or unka chaar kaa betaa chupchaap apni maa ko is haalat main ekatak dekhe ja rahaa tha
 After 25 years we met Khala again
 In a family event, we all met again after 25 years and everything had changed
 meri khala apane shuhar or teen bacchon ke saath ai thi
 She was now the mother of two sons and a daughter
 khala bahut badal chuki thi, itani ki main unhen ek baar pahchaan hi nahin pai
 Khala now spoke very little
 unke haath, pair or chehre par har jagah sujan thi or wo nau maheene pregnent lag rahi thi, par aisa nahin tha
 Khalajitne could not say anything, people came there, everyone asked about the condition of Khala and she just smiled
 khala ke shuhar kamare main jor-jor se hans rahe the or khala ko apana khyaal rakhane kii hidaayat de rahe thea
 Where Khala was sitting, she sat there continuously for five hours without moving
 
 
 
 When no one came to help
 When Khala came home 25 years ago, the family forcefully sent him back within a week
 khala ke shuhar ne apane hi bete ko kidanap kar liya tha
 Khala had no way left after he threatened to harm his son when he did not return
 yahaan tak ki khala kaa apana parivaar bhi unki madad nahin kar sakaa tha

 On my birthday, the only thing i ask of all of you is that you love your parents
 Cherish them and devote themselves to making them feel that love
 They have made you
 And i ask that you remember my mother fondly, pray for her soul to rest in peace
 Let the love and adulation you’ll showered on her continue and please know that the biggest part of my mother was the love she shared with papa
 And their love is immortal because there was nothing like it in the whole world
 Nothing as joyful and pure and no two people as devoted to one another as they were
 Please respect that because it hurts to think anyone would ever try to tarnish it
 Preserving the sanctity of what they had would mean the world not only to my mother but also to a man who’s entire being revolved around her, and her two children who are all that remains of their love
 Me and Khushi have lost our mother but papa has lost his "jaan"
 She was so much more than just an actor or a mother or a wife
 She was the ultimate and the best in all these roles
 It mattered a great deal to her to give love and to get love
 For people to be good and gracious and kind
 She didn’t understand frustration or malice or jealousy
 So let's be that
 Let’s be full of only good and give only love
 That would make her happy, to know that even in death, she gave you all something
 The courage and inspiration to fill yourselves with nothing but love and rid yourselves of bitterness in any way and form
 That's what she stood for
 Dignity, strength and innocence
 Thank you for the love and support everyone has shown us in the past couple of days
 It’s given us hope and strength and we can’t thank you all enough

 The Lokpal can be a legal weapon in curbing corruption

 Different from that, 300 lakh crores

 aapane yah bhi kaha tha ki party banaaenge or aap chanakya kii bhoomika main rahenge
 We are saying that good people should choose and create an atmosphere for it

 It can be interpreted as both a river or a Sindhi community
 halafname main kaha gaya he ki ‘donon shabd ‘sindh’ or ‘sindhu’ nadi yaa sindhi samudaay kaa zikr karte hai
 The national anthem is not an account that defines the regions of the country and when it was written it is not a list of states or territories that were part of India at the time

 darasal, aisi khabaren chal rahi thim ki china kii companiyon se mil rahi chunautiyaan ke bich samsung ne karmchaariyon kii chantni kaa faisla liya he
 However, the company issued an explanation saying that its business in India is growing steadily and there are no plans to retrench
 company ne kiya khandansamsung india ke pravaktaa ne bataaya ki company bharat ko lekar kamited he or yahaan lagaataar nivesh kar rahi he
 It is focusing on setting up the world's largest mobile phone factory, investment in research and development (R&D) and new businesses such as 5G networks

 We are committed to job creation and will continue to add manpower during the year
 samsung india ke pravaktaa ne iske saath hi yah bhi bataaya ki bijanas kii baat karen to tamaam nae products ke saath ham apana market share majboot kar paae hai or 2019 company ke liye ek record saal hoga
 What was done? Claim: a media report said that Samsung, the country's largest consumer electronics and mobile phone maker, is going to trim its cost as part of its plan to rationalize costs
 karmchaariyon kii sankhya 1000 bataai ja rahi thi
 20,000 employees in India: According to an estimate, there are about 20 thousand employees in Samsung units in India
 akhbaar ke anusaar sabhi samsung ke sabhi bijness head ne indian oparations ke president ko kharaab pradarshan karne waalon kii suchi saunp di he

 Congress candidate from Amritsar East Assembly seat Navjot Singh Sidhu is also known for his 'sidhuvani'
 comentry ho yaa lofter sho, yaa phir raajnneetik raily kaa plateform, jab siddhu bolte hai to unke muhaavarey, shero-shaayari sunne laayak hote hai
 But do you know that there was a time when Sidhu used to shy away from talking to anyone due to his shy nature
 kabhi baat karne main chhutate the paseenejab siddhu ne team india ke liye opening batsman ke taur par aagaaj kiya tha to siddhu dressing room main bhi chupchaap rahanaa hi pasand karte the
 Sidhu used to lose his sweat when he used to talk to the media
 is baat kii pushti ek baar team india ke purv captain kapildev ne bhi kii thi
 How did metamorphosis happen? How did Sidhu transform, Sidhu himself revealed the secret from Aaj Tak
 siddhu ne mana ki jab wo cricket khelaa karte the to us vakt kisi se baat karne kii naubat aati thi to idhar-udhar hone kii koshish karte the
 According to Sidhu, he used to take leave when the professor called for a debate
 siddhu ne kaha, 'kabhi achche ran bana letaa tha to dar lagata tha ki ab media se baat kerani padegi
 'this is confidence
 How Sidhu got confidence in Rajbolan, Sidhu credits the meditation (meditation)
 siddhu ne kaha, 'main subah 3 baje uthakar dhyaan lagaataa hum, isse mujhe shakti mili
 All this change that has come in me is the majesty of God
 paramatma aapke andar hi milegaa, ye kahin or nahin milegaa
 'if you want to say something, do you do any special preparation? In response to this question, Sidhu said,' i do not walk around with a book, i do not go on hiding a book
 aatmavishvaas kya he, public spiking kya he? jo aatma se sampark karegaa
 The one who is immersed inside will be united with God sitting inside
 aatma se sampark he to aatmavishvaas he
 If that contact is lost, then there is doubt in the name of God
 agar andeh kaa ilaaj karnaa he to aatma ke saath sampark rakho
 Stay dissolved within, everything will be alright
 ' Sanjay Sinha's third creation 'samay' is unique
 samay kii upadeyata kaa jaisaa varnan udhaaharan sahit pustak main uplabdh he vah sanjay sinha ke hi vash kii baat he
 The time-cycle is moving, if you walk with it, if you fall behind, you will only carry life and will not be able to live it
 agar jeene kii lalak he to phir samay ke saath saamanjasy bithie or aashaatheet safalataa praapt kiijie
 Sanjay has made it very clear in the book that time never waits for anyone
 agar aage badhanaa he to samay ke saath kadam milakar aage badhie varanaa jindagi ruk jaaegi or samay aage nikal jayega
 From time to time, events take place in the life of writer Sanjay Sinha and he is warned that in life we get enough time to prepare for every task but we may not be able to make proper use of it and after the time runs out After that only we are left thinking that if we get a chance again, we could do the missed work with full efficiency
 lekin samay nikal jane par hamaare saamne pashchaatap ke atirikt doosraa koi rasta nahin rah jaataa
 And then whatever we get, we consider it as destiny
 pustak main lekhak sanjay sinha ne khud kaa or bollywood star shahrukh khan kaa udhaaharan diya he yahi siddh karne ke liye ki 1988 main donon saath-saath tahaltey the or ek ne puri taiyaari kii or jivan main assi fisadi paaya or doosraa sab jaanate hue bhi chalis fisadi par rah gaya
 The reason is clear that those who proceed with complete preparation win the battle
 samay kii gambhirtha ko samajhnaa ati aavashyak he
 The one who has identified keeps pace with the cycle of time and moves forward in the race of life
 'samay' pustak hamen jeena sikhaati he, hamen anushaasit hone kii prerana detii he
 Every event that happens in life makes us think
 bachapan main maa dwaara sunai gai kahaniyon ko sanjay ne jivan kii paathshaala mana he kyonki prayek kahani main koi na koi sandesh avashya chipa hota he
 If we remove these messages in our life when we grow up, then not only do we foresee the crisis that is coming, but we can also save ourselves from that crisis
 sanjay simha jindagi main rishton ko bahut ahmiyat dete hai
 The same thing is seen in his book 'samay'
 sanjay ke hi shabdon main "akele ham muskura sakate hai lekin rishton ke bich ham thahaake lagaate hai
 "today, man has become very lonely in the race to move forward
 apane man kii baat kisi se saajha nahin kar paata
 Like Sanjay of the Mahabharata, Sanjay has realized from his connoisseurs that Hastinapur of 'tan' will be green with all artificial means of convenience and communication but he will lose the Kurukshetra of 'mana' because he has no one to communicate
 will get
 samay rahete rishton kii khushboo pahchaan lijie kyonki rishte hote hai sadaa ke liye
 Sanjay has also identified nobility and values through small incidents
 or yahi sikh di he ki samay kaa ek hi pal hota he or vah hota he vahi pal jise aap ji rahe hote hai
 There is a lot of power in trust, so no matter how many ups and downs come in life, trust should never be broken
 sanjay bahut hi ashaavadi drushtikon rakhte hai or samay ke har pal ko puri tanmayata se jite hai or jivan kii har ghatana ke sandesh ko jivan main utaar lete hai
 This thinking of Sanjay gives him a personality that is different
 har vyakti se unka atmiyata kaa rishta shaayad isiilie jud jaataa he
 Human life is brittle at this moment, that's why Sanjay has also advocated that whatever happens in the world has some purpose
 yadi yah ham bhalee-bhaanti soch len to sambhavat: samaj jaaenge ki samay bada balavaan hota he
 With time, if we free ourselves from the natural defects of human nature, then the world of happiness will be in front of us
 hamaara 'ahan' samaapt ho jayega or vinamrata hamen sabhi kaa athmiya bana degi or ham vivek se nir or ksheer ko alag kar paaenge
 Whatever we want to meet in our life is for a particular purpose
 yah hamaare upar nirbhar karata he ki grahan kya karte hai
 Sanjay has put more emphasis on perseverance of mind
 kamjor man se ham jiti hui baaji bhi haar jate hai lekin man kaa vishwaas hamen kabhi haarane nahin detaa
 'time' is defined by Sanjay Sinha with great skill, cleanliness
 yah samay kii aandhi hi thi ki indira gandhi jaisi louh mahila bhi uskaa shikaar ho gayi
 And some of his supporters became his bitter opponents
 par virodh karte samay yah bhi dhyaan rakhaana jaruri he ki virodh kaa swaroop kya hoga
 It was the cycle of time that Indira Gandhi refined herself over time
 or pun sattashin huin
 It becomes necessary to scrub yourself over time
 saath hi yah bhi aavashyak he ki ham ati vishwaas ke shikaar na hon
 Otherwise the fall will be ours
 naa hi apane ird-gird koi kisi drusht vyakti ko sangrakshan pradaan kare anyathaa ek din vah hamen hi apana shikaar banayega
 Sanjay Sinha's approach is very broad
 har ghatana ne unhen ek nai disha di he
 Sanjay has also made love and religion very clear
 man main ishwar ke prati aasthaa hi hamen manushyata pradaan karti he aisa maananaa he sanjay kaa
 Human life is precious
 hamen dukhon kaa saahas ke saath muqabla karnaa chahie
 If there is grief, then there is a way to get rid of it
 nivaaran kaa upaay bhi sanjay ne sujhaayaa he
 If you have reconciled over time, then your life is meaningful
 samay ke hi sandarbh main switzraland kaa ullekh sanjay ne kiya he
 Which is not only a very beautiful country but also punctual
 samay kii izzat se hi aapaki izzat he bas ummid kabhi mat chhodie
 while there's life there's hope
 kisi cheez ko shiddat se chaahakar dekhie, vah aapako avashya milegi
 Sanjay is also very hopeful towards God
 unka maananaa he ki jinke saath bhagwaan hote hai amodh baan bhi unka kuch nahin bigaad saktaa
 The importance of truth, honesty, relationships is also in time like the first two books of Sanjay
 bahut hi kam samay main sanjay sinha kii ye teesri kitaab he
 All three books have received a lot of praise
 itnaa tej lekhan or uskaa pathakon par sakaaratmak prabhaav sanjay kii lekhan pratibha or fasebuk se rishton ko jodne main unki sakriyata ko sarthak banaata he
 We did not bring anything or will not take it, our behavior, our humility will go with us
 yahi to sikhaaya tha sanjay ko unki maa ne
 Sanjay also believes that whatever form a woman is in your life, a mother remains hidden in it

 # Emmys america raashtrapati donald trump ne apane bayaan se palatate hue kaha he ki 2016 raashtrapati chunaav main roosi hastkshep ke sambandh main khufia agenciyon ke vishleshan par unhen puraa vishwaas he or helsinki main rus ke apane samakaksh ke saath baithak ke dauraan is maamle par unki jabaan phisal gai thi
 Trump was also criticized by his party, including the opposition, for not supporting the analysis of US intelligence agencies while jointly addressing a press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin
 apane raashtrapati kaarykaal main sambhavat: pehali baar galati sweekaar karte hue trump ne kaha ki putin ke saath shikhar sammelan ke baad somvaar ko jab vah laute to unhone 'mahasoos kiya ki 2016 calmerica chunaavon main rus ke hastkshepke bare main apane bayaan par spashtikaran kii jarurat he
 Trump had to face opposition from the opposition as well as the Republican Party for not supporting the American intelligence community's conclusion on Russia's interference in the 2016 US elections during a joint press conference with President Putin in Helsinki, following which he made a statement
 Reversed
 Some people HATE the fact that i got along well with President Putin of Russia
 They would rather go to war than see this
 It’s called Trump Derangement Syndrome!— Donald J
 Trump (@realdonaldtrump) July 18, 2018 Trump told reporters at the White House, 'I have full faith in America's great intelligence agencies
 haalanki mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki roosi krityon kaa raashtrapati chunaavon ke nateezon par koi asar nahin padaa, main yah spasht karnaa chaahunga
 i have said many times, i accept the conclusion of our intelligence community that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections
 ' putin ke saath samvaadadaata sammelan main trump ne kaha tha ki rus ne 2016 raashtrapati chunaavon main koi hastkshep nahin kiya tha
 He had said, "I see no reason" why Russia would interfere in the US election
 white house main apane is bayaan par safai dete hue trump ne kaha ki unkijaban phisal gaithi or vah 'kyon' kii jagah 'kyon nahin' kahana chaahate the
 The US President said, 'I have on several occasions supported the reports of intelligence agencies in which they had spoken about Russian interference in the US election

 This bridge has been hit by the disaster, the youngest children have been killed
 pichley ek maah se adhikansh bachche apane maa-baap se nahi mil paye hai
 Even after a month, the administration has not been able to do anything to remove these children
 congress ke sthaneey saansad satpal maharaj bhi yahaan kaa daura karke ja chuke hai or aashwaasan dekar gayi, par unke jane ke baad unhen bhi in bacchon kii sud nahi
 The children are very upset due to being trapped for a month and often start crying but there is no one to listen to the sorrow and pain of the children
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav kii ladaai ab apane antim mode tak pahunch gai he
 How the credibility of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency Varanasi is saved, the entire central leadership of the BJP is engaged in this battle
 baavjood iske bhaajapa pratyaashiyon ko virodhiyon ke saath hi apano kii bhi chunauti mil rahi he, jisase kai siton par ladaai rochak hoti najar aa rahi he
 There are a total of eight assembly constituencies in Varanasi
 sewapuri, shivpuri, ajgara, pindra, shahar uttari, shahar dakshini, banaras kaint or rohaniyaan
 In the last assembly election 2012, BJP held three seats in Varanasi Cantt, Varanasi North and Varanasi Southern seats
 
 At present, in Banaras, the BJP is struggling to save all these three seats, while in Sevapuri Assembly also there is a contest of thorns
 
 Varanasi Dakshin Sitamodi Parliamentary constituency, if any seat is the most discussed then it is Varanasi Dakshin seat
 isaki vajah yahaan se bhaajapa ke diggaj va vartmaan vidhayak vidhayak or lagaataar saat baar chunaav jeet chuke shyamdev raay choudhary kaa tikat katnaa he
 
 is seat ko brahman bahul seat maani jaati he
 From here, the BJP has fielded Neelkanth Tiwari by cutting the ticket of sitting MLA Shyamdev Rai Chaudhary
 isi seat se sapa va congress gathbandhan kii taraf se rajesh mishra ko tikat mila he
 Rajesh, however, has also been elected as an MP on the Congress ticket from Banaras
 baavjood iske unhen bhi matadaataaon ke bich kadi mehnat kerani pad rahi he
 
 basapa ne yahaan se rakesh treepathi ko maidan main utaara he
 He is giving tough competition to his opponents
 ilaake ke log bataate hai ki brahman bahul seat par jeet kii kunjee muslim va dalit matadaataaon ke paas he
 Here the trend of Muslim voters is being considered towards SP
 aise main rajesh mishra bhaajapa ummidavaar ko kadi takkar de rahe hai
 
 idhar, bhaajapa ke netaaon kaa daawa he ki kadi mashkkat ke baad party ke naaraaz kaaryakartaaon ko manaa liya gaya he
 But according to BJP sources, many rebels are busy in fraternizing the BJP
 
 BJP state president Keshav Prasad Maurya said during a conversation with the news agency, 'there is no resentment anywhere
 sabko manaa liya gaya he
 All BJP workers are busy winning the party
 kuch baagi kaaryakartaaon ko baahar kaa rasta bhi dikhaaya gaya he
 '
 haalanki shyamdev raay choudhary kii naaraazgi se bhaajapa ko kis kadar nuksaan ho rahaa tha, iskaa adanja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki bhaajapa aalaa kaman ko ek varsh pehle hi baqayda ek press note jari kar yah kahana padaa ki party unhen vidhaan parishad main bhejegi
 
 varanasi uttari seetvaranasi uttari seat par bhi bhaajapa virodhiyon or apano ke bich fansi he
 The BJP has given ticket to sitting MLA Ravindra Jaiswal from here
 sapa va congress gathbandhan kii tarah se abdul samad ansaari chunaav maidan main hai
 BSP has given ticket to Sujit Kumar Maurya from this seat
 shahar uttari se bhaajapa ke baagi ummidavaar sujith singh tikaa maidan main bhaajapa kaa khel bigaadane main lage hue hai
 However, the party has expelled him from the party and is in the fray as an independent candidate
 abdul samad ansaari ke eklaute muslim hone kii vajah se muslim matadaataaon kaa rujhaan unki taraf mana ja rahaa he
 Teeka said that instead of honoring its workers, the BJP expelled them from the party
 ab ham nirdaleey pratyaashee ke taur par chunaav maidan main hai
 The public will decide what our future will be
 bhaajapa ko is baar janata hi sabak sikhayegi
 Another BJP worker Ashok Kumar Singh is also in the fray from this seat
 vah bhi pratyaashiyon ke bich kadi mehnat kar rahe hai
 However, it is too early to say how much support the voters will get
 varanasi kaint sitmodi ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi main varanasi kaint seat par bhi kaante kii takkar dekhne ko mil rahi he
 However, this time the SP and Congress alliance have given ticket to Anil Srivastava from here
 anil pehle bhi congress se hi is seat se chunaav lard chuke hai
 Then he got about 50 thousand votes
 is baar vah gathbandhan ke bharose bhaajapa ko dhul chataane kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 Anil Srivastava said that Kashi gave a Prime Minister to the country but even after three years the situation here remains the same
 vikaas ke naam par kuch nahin hua he
 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has done a lot of work here and the biggest task is to provide 24-hour power to Banaras
 anil shrivastav ko haalanki is baar varanasi se damdaar pratyaashee ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 People of the area say that the BJP has given ticket to Saurabh Srivastava, son of last time MLA Jyotsna Srivastava
 ilaake ke log ek taraf jahaan parivaarwaad kaa aarope laga rahe hai vahiin duusari or anil shrivastav jaise manze hue khilaadi ke saamne saurabh apni puri takat lagaae hue hai
 The BSP has fielded Rizwan Ahmed from this seat
 kaint main haalanki muslim matadaataaon kii acchhee khaasi sankhya he, lekin yahaan ke jaankaar bataate hai ki bhaajapa ko haraane ke liye muslim matadaataaon kaa jhukaav sapa-congress gathbandhan kii taraf ho saktaa he
 Opponents have also laid siege to the BJP in Sevpuri seat of Sevapuri assembly seat
 yun to is seat par bhaajapa ke sahyogi party apana dal (anupriya patel) ke ummidavaar nilaratan patel hai
 While from this seat, Anupriya's mother Krishna Patel has given ticket to Vibhuti Narayan Singh on behalf of her group
 vibhuti narayan singh lambey samay tak bhaajapa ke netaa rahe hai or ilaake ke matadaataaon ke bich acchhee khaasi paith he
 On the other hand, Minister Surendra Patel is contesting from the SP and Congress alliance
 pichhali baar bhi vah is seat se achche antar se jite the

 pradhanmantri narendra modi or roosi raashtrapati vladimir putin ne somvaar ko telephone par baat kii or is dauraan donon ne pramukh dweepaksheeya evam antarrashtriya muddon par charchaa kii or aatankwaad se nibatane ke liye sahyog badhaane kaa sankalp kiya
 Russian diplomatic sources said Putin wished Modi success in the upcoming parliamentary election
 unhone bataaya ki donon netaaon ne antarrashtriya aatankwaad se ladane or anya pramukh vishwa muddon ko hal karne ke liye sahyog badhaane kii sajhi ichha doharaai
 According to sources, the talks between the two leaders focused mainly on bilateral cooperation and current international issues
 sutron ne bataaya ki baatcheet ke dauraan roosi raashtrapati ne sitambar 2019 main vladivostok main hone vaale kaarykram purvi aarthik manch ke liye mukhya atithi ke rup main modi ko aamantrit kiya
 The two leaders gave each other warm greetings of the New Year
 videsh mantralay dwaara jari ek bayaan ke mutabik pichley saal samrik saajhedaari ke kshetra main banaae gaye pragati ko donon deshon ne barkaraar rakhane par sahmati jataai
 Let us know that when President Putin came to India in October last year, he had also invited PM Modi for the Eastern Economic Forum
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi apni ore se rus ke logon ko christmas ke maukey par badhai di
 According to the statement, the two leaders appeared to agree that the relations between India and Russia play an important role in maintaining global multilateral relations
 isliye donon desh sanyukt raashtra, bricks, essio or duusare sanghathanon main apane najdiki sambandh kaayam rakhenge
 Whether it is considered an effect of the Anna movement or any long-term thinking, but so far the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which considers the nation important rather than the individual, has now come to the conclusion that 'the country needs honest and character heroes' and 'branches' Such heroes will be discovered through 'gorakhpur main 14,15 or 16 aktubar ko hui sangh kii rashtriya kaaryakari mandal kii baithak isliye khaas taur par yaad kii jaaegi ki pehali baar sangh pramukh mohanrao madhukarrav bhagwat ne saarvajanik rup se aahvaan kiya ki 'sangh ko sahanubhuti nahin, balki swayamsevakon kii jarurat he
 'the meeting of the National Executive Board is considered important in the sense that it is on the basis of the decisions taken by it that the Sangh decides the outline of its programs, campaigns and movements throughout the year
 yah sanyog hi kaha jayega ki unke pravaas ke dauraan anna se sangh ke rishton or andolan ke 'shrey' ko lekar digvijay singh, arvind kejariwal or khud anna ke itane bayaan aae ki sangh ko baar-baar is babat apni sthiti spasht kerani padi
 In a public address on the occasion of Vijayadashami festival, Bhagwat had clearly stated that the Sangh supports every good work, hence the movement of Anna got its support
 baad main sangh ke sar kaaryvahak suresh bhaiyaji joshi ne patrakaron se baat karte hue congress ke mahasachiv (digvijay) dwaara shadyantrpurvak uthaae gaye vivaad par anna jaise vyakti ke bhi kutil rajnatik chaal se prabhavit ho jane par afsos jataate hue kaha ki sangh ko anna se koi parhez nahin he par yadi anna ko sangh se parhez he to is babat unheen se poocha janaa chahie
 However, if we look at the resolutions passed after the three-day contemplation of 450 top officials from 39 provinces, it seems clear that in the coming days, the Sangh will not only intensify its efforts to enrich its organizational structure, but also through movements among the masses Will also increase its activity
 iske liye sangh ne ek taraf ganga main badhate pradooshan ke khilaaf jaagrukta abhiyaan chalaane or swami vivekanand kii 150veen jayanti ke maukey par desh or duniya main vividh kaarykram yojit karne jaise saanskrithik prakalp chune hai to duusari taraf centre dwaara laae ja rahe sampradayik evam lakshith hinsa nivaaran vidheyak ke khilaaf vyapak janandolan chalaane kaa bhi faisla kiya he
 In the resolution, this bill has been described as 'breaking the unity and integrity of society', saying that it will not only increase the distance between the majority and minorities, but it will also increase the distinction between Scheduled Castes and Tribes in Hindu society
 iske alaava sangh rashtriya suraksha ke masale par 'sarkaar kii niskriyata' par bhi aakraamak ravaiya apana saktaa he
 The 5-page resolution passed in the Executive Board on effective strategic initiatives for national security includes threats from around the country, especially challenges faced by China, its infiltration of projects in strategically important areas and Chinese in telecom technology such as 3G and 4G
 The dangers that can arise from increased use of equipment are discussed in detail
 baithak ke baad sar kaaryvahak suresh joshi ne dhanchaagat suraksha vyavasthaaon par sarkaar ke sust ravaie ko khatarnaak maanate hue kaha ki ''hamaari senaaon kaa manobal to acha he, lekin sadhano ke abhaav se vah durbal dikhe, yah chintajanak he
 However, in the Sangh mob, former chief Sudarshan, Sah Sarkaryavah Dattatraya Hosabale, Ram Madhav, Suresh Soni, Ramji Lal and vhp's Ashok Singhal, Praveen Togadia, besides BJP state president Surya Pratap Shahi and Vinay Katiyar Joined, but instead of commenting on issues related to the BJP, the Sangh brushed aside its internal decision
 lekin bhaajapa is baithak ko sanjivani kii tarah maan rahi he

 If you are also troubled by the difficulties of this topic then these tips are for you: 1
 agar aap kisi topic ko nahin samaj paa rahe hai, to use chhodkar aage badhane ke bajaae usee par focus karen
 Suppose you are reading algebra and you are having trouble understanding it, then do not leave it
 yah kabhi nahin sochen ki ise chhodkar duusare chapter ko padhanaa behatar rahegaa
 All the chapters of Mathematics are related to each other
 agar aap pehle vaala koi chapter chodenge to aage ke chapter main aapako or kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Therefore, after working a little more, prepare the chapter which is in hand
 2
 Try to make the example given in the books
 isko hal karke dekhenge to aapako yah samaj me aa jayega ki us chapter ke sawaal kaise honge
 Apart from the book, you can also use dvds, cds, audio cassettes to understand the examples
 chapter kii shuruyaat main aasaan sawaalon ko banaaen
 Step by step you will start solving difficult questions too
 ganit kitaab ko padhane se zyada behatar uski practice karnaa hota he
 3
 agar aapako koi ganit ke sawaal samajhane yaa hal karne ke liye kahe to turant uske liye taiyaar ho jaaen
 When you try to tell someone, you yourself will start to understand him better
 aisa mana jaataa he ki aap jab kisi ko kuch sikhaate hai to us topic par aapaki behatar pakad ban jaati he
 So try to solve the questions of others as much as possible
 4
 Always keep your solution clean
 isse aap sawaal banaate samay kanphyus nahin honge
 5
 formula yaad rakhana ganit main sabase zyada jaruri he
 If you do not remember that, then your time will also be wasted and you will not be able to solve the question

 Dhoni, who has played four matches, has so far scored a total of 33 runs in which he scored 12 *, 5, 11 and 5 runs on Friday in the match against Rising Pune Supergiant of Gujarat
 sahvaag ne is baat par jor diya ki jis pojishan par dhoni batting karne ke liye aate hai vah kathin he or logon ko dhiraj rakhane kii jarurat he kyonki vah jaldi josh- kharos ke saath form main vaapasi karenge
 Also read - Ganguly not trusting Dhoni, said - Suspecting to be a good T20 player, Sehwag said in a conversation with a channel, "the position on which Dhoni comes to bat is very tough
 vah abhi bhi number 5 or 6 par behtareen hai
 There is no doubt that he will return to form soon
 ipel main abhi bahut samay bachaa he
 a player like Dhoni should not be judged in three or four innings
 ”ipel se na parakhe dhoni kaa tallentengland ke khilaaf siries main dhoni ke pradarshan kii tarif karte hue sahvaag ne kaha ki dhoni kisi bhi tarah se kharaab form main nahin hai or aage kaha ki dhoni ke bina champions trophy kii bilkul bhi kaamana nahin kii jaani chahie
 He said, "he recently scored a match-winning century against England
 isliye mujhe nahin lagata ki vah apni form main nahin hai
 You cannot even wish for Team India to go to the Champions Trophy without Dhoni
 is tarah kii chijen ipel jaise toornament main ho sakati hai
 An experienced player like Dhoni should not be tested in a tournament like the IPL
 ye thik he agar aap nae navele khilaadi kii pratibha ko ipel ke aadhaar par aankate ho
 At the same time, it is difficult for a new-born player to play in front of so many people
 ”gauratlab he kii dhoni ke lekar kuch din pehle hi purv bhartiya captain saurav ganguli ne kaha tha ki unhen pakkaa yakeen nahin he ki dhoni achche tii-20 khilaadi hai
 In such a situation, these words of Virender Sehwag can be the answer to Dada's questions

 This school was to have a board examination on Saturday
 aatankiyon kii is harakat se saaf he ki ve kashmir main thik hote halaat se baukhalaaye hue hai
 Since October 31, Kashmir has become a union territory and life is slowly returning to its tracks there

 Killing 5 laborers, tell that recently 5 militants were also killed by terrorists in Kulgam of Jammu and Kashmir
 sabhi 5 majdoor pashchim bengal ke murshidaabad ke rahane vaale the
 The names of the workers killed are Kamaluddin, Mursalim, Rofik, Nomuddin and Rafiqul
 mangalvaar ko hue hamale main ek majdoor gambhir rup se ghayal bhi ho gaya
 The injured man is named Zohiruddin
 ghayal majdoor kaa aspataal main ilaaj karavaaya ja rahaa he
 According to the police, the militants opened fire on the laborers in Kutrusa village in Kulgam district, in which five laborers died on the spot
 murshidaabad ke sagardidhi thane ke bokhaara bahlnagar gaanv ke rahane vaale in mazdooron ko aatankiyon ne pehle kidanap kar liya phir inaki hatya kar di
 These laborers used to work as masons in Kulgam in Kashmir
 ye sabhi majdoor ek maheene pehle kaam karne ke liye kashmir gaye the
 On October 31, the new system came into force in Jammu and Kashmir on the target of terrorists
 anuchhed 370 ke nishprabhavi hone ke baad kashmir ab centre shasit pradesh main tabadil ho gaya
 This is the reason that in the last few days, terrorists have started targeting the workers
 pichley kuch din main aatanki aise hi hamale kar 11 mazdooron kii jaan le chuke hai
 On Tuesday, when 23 mps of the European Parliament came to see the picture of peace in Jammu and Kashmir, the terrorists attacked Kulgam
 aatankiyon ke hamale main jin paanch mazdooron kii maut hui wo sabhi pashchim bengal ke rahane vaale the or yahaan ghar banane main mazdooree kar rahe the

 Explain that Article 370 was neutralized in Jammu and Kashmir on August 5, after which many restrictions were imposed in Jammu and Kashmir
 isi bich aatanki lagaataar maahaul bigaadane kaa kaam kar rahe hai

 31 oktober ko jammu-kashmir centre shasit pradesh ban gaya
 In such a situation, the terrorists are constantly trying to spoil the atmosphere
 america main raashtrapati chunaav ko teen maheene shesh bache hai or ab yahaan chunaav prachaar kaaphi tej ho chukaa he
 With the election campaign booming, both the candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have launched sharp attacks on each other
 ‘robinhood’ ke sandarbh main obama ne apane pratidwandvi mit romany ko ‘romanyhud’ kaha to republican ummidavaar ne palatwaar karne main der nahin kii
 Romney said that the President's attack on him is completely wrong and part of 'obamaloni'
 obama or romany ke bich chal rahe tikhe aarope-pratyarope ke bich america raajnneeti main do nae shabd jud gaye hai
 These two words are 'romneywood' and 'obamaloni'
 america main isi saal november main raashtrapati chunaav hona he
 The US president targeted Romney, saying that the Republican candidates are 'romneyhood' because he would benefit the rich rather than the poor, in contrast to the style of Robinhood through his tax scheme
 obama ke waar par romany ne bina der kiye palatwaar kiya
 He alleged that the attack by Obama is going to promote the trend of 'hypocrisy, disgusting, untruth and obamaloni'
 romany ne ek channel ke saath baatcheet main kaha, ‘ham dekh rahe hai ki raashtrapati mere or meri nitiyon ke bare main kai baaten kar rahe hai jo puri tarah galat hai
 He is speaking contrary to the truth
 ’ilinoys main ek chunavi prachaar ke kaarykram main romany ne vahaan maujuud logon se kaha ki ve america raashtrapati ke kaamkaaj par gaur karen
 He said, 'if you want to know where Obama's re-election will take us, then you look at his three-and-a-half-year work
 ’ The prospect of Prime Minister Narendra Modi coming back to power is seen to be strong in the first week of the election
 jabaki ye bhi sach he ki is baar uttar pradesh main bhaajapa ke sheersh netaa se kaaryakarta tak maanakar chal rahe hai ki uttar pradesh main siton ko sankhya kam hogi
 It may also be half as compared to the last Lok Sabha election
 lekin iske baavjood ek maheene yaa 45 din pehle tak jo bhaajapa uttar pradesh main haashiye par dabl disit ke liye sangharsh kar rahi thi vah ab khel main vaapasi kar chuki he
 If you look at the politics of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar from the political prism, keeping your prejudice at bay for some time, then you will come to the same conclusion that it was not difficult for Prime Minister Modi to become Prime Minister once again
 bihar jahaan abhi tak mahagathabandhan siton kii sankhya par maathapai kar rahaa he uski tulana main uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party- bispi mahagathbandhan main koi matbhed nahin he lekin congress ke alag jane ke kaaran kai siton par muslim voter kaa bikharaav tay he
 There are several reasons in favor of BJP in Uttar Pradesh that suddenly seem to pave the way for victory for it
 isamen sabase bada factor he pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa vyaktitv jo rafel maamle main rahul gandhi dwaara lagaae gaye tamaam aaropon ke baavjood unke samarthakon ke liye bedaag he
 PM Modi is currently visiting Uttar Pradesh
 bhartiya raajnneeti main kai dashak ke baad modi ek aise rajaneta ke rup main ubhare hai jo apane samarthakon ke liye kuch bhi galat nahin kar sakate
 Those you can say have emerged as leaders with a cult image
 unke samarthak aapako har sachai sweekaar karte mil jaaenge ki desh main shikshit berozegaar pareshaan hai, kisaan barbaad ho rahaa he, pashu khaskar gaay kii kharid-bikri par lagi roak ke kaaran uskaa jivan pareshaani ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 But they argue that Modi is giving a befitting reply to Pakistan
 ye ek aisa tark hota he jiske saamne ve apane netaa kii har naakaami par pardaa daal dete hai
 The second thing is in favor of BJP, its strong organization
 uttar pradesh main agar aap kahin chunaav ke silsile main bhraman karenge to aap amit shah or aresas ke sanghathan ke vistaar kii sachai ko nazarandaaj is chunaav main nahin kar sakate
 Modi will get direct benefit of this in elections
 khaskar gramin ilaakon main booth str ke kaaryakarta jis tarah har charchaa yaa bahes ko apane tark yaa kutark se pravaahit karne kii koshish karte hai usase aapako abhas ho jaataa he ki loksabhaa ke chunaav main unki maheenon-saal kii mehnat ab rang laa rahi he
 Apart from the ten percent reservation for the general classes, who are called forward castes, after losing in three assembly elections last year, you will no longer find angry people of these castes at the Chowk intersections, who have been feeling angry for some time before
 Were
 haalanki kitne logon ko naukari milegi, ye vivaad kaa prashn ho saktaa he
 Apart from this, the farmers, who were running angry, now do not speak against Modi in the hope of getting two thousand rupees
 saadhan, sansaadhan main samaajawaadee party or bispi kam nahin, jameen par unke voter dikhte hai, lekin kaaryakarta yaa to maun hai yaa milte nahin
 The biggest problem is that while both these parties are trying to make it Mandal vs Kamandal, at the moment the BJP, especially Modi, is looking heavy on everyone
 haa uttar pradesh main philhal priyanka gandhi kaa koi asar nahin dikhataa
 Either they anticipate the results of the election or their feedback system will indicate that too much activism in this election is like putting heads in the head
 philhal chunaav prachaar shuru nahin hua he or ummidavaaron ke naam bhi adhikansh partiyon ne jari nahin kiye hai
 Compared to last time, the campaign managers of BJP know that their opponents are united this time, but their supporters will vote for this alliance, no one doubts that
 lekin raajnneeti main aapako yah bhi maanakar chalanaa hota he ki kabhi bhi hawa badal sakati he
 Despite this, the magic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going on in Uttar Pradesh at the moment
 pakistan kii videsh mantri hina rabbaani khaar ne kaha ki islamabad ne 26 navambar ko uttar atlantic sandhi sanghathan (nato) ke hamale ke virodh main somvaar ko germany ke bon shahar main afghanistan ke bhavishya ko lekar hone vaale sammelan main bhaag na lene kaa faisla kiya he
 Khar said that sovereignty and integrity of Pakistan will not be compromised at any cost
 ek samachar channel se baatcheet main unhone kaha ki yah faisla desh kii samprabhutaa ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kiya gaya he
 According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, the Foreign Minister said that Pakistan cannot function effectively in an environment in which its security and sovereignty are not guaranteed by the allies
 unhone kaha ki rashtriya hit sarkaar kii sheersh praathamikta he
 On November 26, 24 Pakistani soldiers were killed in a NATO air raid on two security posts in Pakistan
 iske baad pakistan ne apni bhoomi se nato ko aavashyak saamagree kii aapurti band kar di thi
 Today, Kashmir, which has got settled on the paradise, is making headlines not for its beautiful litigants and saffron, but for Article 370
 somvaar ko achaanak modi sarkaar ne artical 370 ko jammu-kashmir se hataane kaa faisla kar liya
 Saffron sprouts in Kashmir are famous all over the world
 kashmir ke pampur to jammu ke kishtwar main kesar kii kheti kii jaati he
 People have to pay a hefty price to buy saffron here
 ayurveda main bhi kesar kaa upyog saundarya, swaad or bimariyon kaa ilaaj karne ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he
 But do you know when and where was the origin of this saffron full of qualities
 aaie jaanate hai aakhir kya he 2000 saal pehle shuru hui is kesaria kahani kaa puraa sach
 Saffron is said to be the first to start cultivation of saffron in the Kashmir Valley, especially in the Pampore region in 550, which is still being practiced till date
 kashmiri kesar britain main ugane vaale kesar ko swaad or gun main kadi takkar detaa he
 Among the purple colored flowers of royal saffron-saffron, which are red fibers, one gets the best type of saffron, which is also known as royal saffron
 vaise ek phool main teen se lekar saat tak reshe hote hai or ek baar iskaa beej lagaaya jaataa he to vah 10 se 15 saalon tak jivit rahata he
 How the name of Kashmir Seksar - According to a legend, a Sufi saint came to Kashmir about 800 years ago
 mana jaataa he ki ye sufi sant apane saath madhya-purv se kesar ke kuch paudhe saath lekar aae the
 But once he fell ill, a local hakeem treated him
 jisase khush hokar unhone badale main us hakim ko ek kesar kaa paudha de diya tha
 This is how the plant of saffron came into Kashmir
 itihaaskaar sufi sant kii kahani se nahin sahamat-kashmir ke kuch itihaaskaar is danta katha se sahamat nahin hue
 Mohammad Yusuf Tang, an expert on the ancient culture of Kashmir, says that saffron was produced in Kashmir even before 2000 years
 jiskaa zikr yahaan ke tantric hindu raja kii kahaniyon main bhi kiya gaya he
 According to Professor Tang, traders in Kashmir also traded saffron with ancient Athens, Rome and Iran
 pracheen parampara-yahaan kesar kii kheti karne vaale logon kii maane to kesar kii kheti karne kaa chalan lagbhag 2000 saal purana he
 Because of which the method of cultivating saffron and after reaching it to the fields, every method of growing saffron is absolutely ancient
 kesar kaa phool-kesar kaa phool bangnee rang kaa hota he
 There are three red spots in the middle of each flower
 kesar ke phulon kaa kuch bhi hissaa phenkaa nahin jaataa
 Petals are eaten as vegetables
 danthal jaanwaron ko khaane ke liye de die jate hai or baaki jo bachaa wo hota he asli kesar
 It also has different types
 koun sa kesar sabase shuddh-laal dhabbe yaa daag sabase vishuddh kism kaa kesar hota he jisaki sabase adhik maang hoti he
 After this comes the number of stamens and finally a mixed mixture of all these, which is the cheapest kind of saffron
 ise kisaan apane paas hi rakh lete hai
 Awakened by the devastation caused by the floods in Uttarakhand, the district administration announced a red alert in 30 villages along the banks of Yamuna and Hindon
 sutron ne bataaya ki 30 gaanvon ke nivaasiyon ko anya sthanon par jane ke liye taiyaar rahane ko kaha gaya he

 He also asked the officials to take steps to ensure that the flood waters do not flow into the villages

 Where is the relationship related in this? But in the book 'rishtey' the storyteller Sanjay Sinha has forced everyone to think and change their perception
 sanjay sinha kii kitaab ‘rishte’ adbhut he
 The expression in simple, simple and mind-blowing language has made the book unique

 rishton kii parakh, gaharaai or unki ooshmaa ko dil se jiya he lekhak sanjay sinha ne
 It is clear from the book itself that the relationship is not only of blood but also the truth of the moment and moment also binds us firmly like an unbroken rope and we live it for our lifetime

 Facebook has formed an entire family in the form of mother Urmila Srivastava, elder brother Jawahar Goel, Pawan Chaturvedi, Amit Chaturvedi, sister Ranjana Tripathi, friend Monica Guneta and Sakhi Swadha Sharma
 rishte, jivan main sabase mahatvapurn hai
 Relationships give us strength and sometimes make us think
 kabhi man ko jhakzor dete hai to kabhi antarman ke kisi kone main amit chhap chhod dete hai
 It is this relationship that fills a new light in life and the corner of the mind becomes bright
 inhen rishton kii behad khubasurat baangi he kitaab rishte
 The 'rishtey' composition gives a clear impression of the life experiences of the creator
 rachanaakaar sanjay sinha ne jivan main bahut se utaar-chadhaav dekhe
 The heart of the creator Sanjay Sinha, filled with sensations, gets wet inside and every day there is a description on Facebook which will make you feel obliged to move in the gag of the relationship at some point throughout the day by familiarizing with the gentle conscience of the creator
 is

 Connecting on Facebook How a relationship becomes unbreakable for a lifetime
 dil main gaharaai se utre yah rishte kabhi kisi nitant aparichit ke dukh main hamaari ankhe bhigo dete hai or kabhi ham in rishton ke sukh main aahlaadit hote hai
 This anonymous unfamiliar relationship inspires us, gives us the courage to struggle

 You have broken up with an old boyfriend and are enjoying dating a new friend
 ladkaa vaaki acha he or aap ab use lekar gambhir bhi ho chali hai, lekin ek samasya he
 That is, your dating partner does not look as serious as you are
 to mohatarama qamar kas lijie
 Ask yourself whether you really want to work hard to get that boy and if the answer is yes, then get involved in getting your partner beaten up today
 par kuch is tarah ki aapke changul se vah kabhi baahar hi na nikal paaen
 We give you tips
 
 
 pehali najar main hi agar vah aapako bha gaye or aapane unke saath ko kuch maheenon nahin jivan bhar ke liye paane kaa man bana liya, to bhul kar bhi pehali date par jajbaati hokar sambandh mat banaaen
 Because with this you can join the list of 'one Night Stated Relations' instead of joining their special friends
 kabhi bhi khud ko unke mutabik dhaalane kii bhul na karen
 If you change yourself according to them, then your personality will not affect them
 kyonki aapkaa asli cheharaa to unke saamne aayega hi nahin
 Enjoy it to the fullest, no matter what day or year of dating, so that your partner does not feel that you do not enjoy them
 dating ke shuruaati dinon main apane doston ko utana hi time or tavajjoh den, jinaki aap apane partner ko detii hai
 If you find their little things bad, do not worry
 jab mahilaayein dil se sochane lagati hai, to ve baton ko dil par se laga leti hai
 But waiting in the initial stage is a better option
 kam se kam teen maheene main to aap unase choti choti baton par naaraaz nahin ho sakati
 Never tell your boyfriend between him or his friends, as long as he does not accept you as his girlfriend in front of everyone
 agar aapako unke rahan sahan main koyee cheez pasand nahin he, to chup rahane ke bajaae unhen turant is baat se avgat karaaen
 If he refrains from making promises, give him an example of couples he has met and who are happy with each other
 yakeen maniye iske baad vah sahajata se aapke saath vaadon kii door main bandha sakenge
 If they have had an old love affair, then you cannot pressure them to cut or forget them suddenly
 isliye agar vah apni puraani garlfriend se baatcheet karte hai or unke man main vaaki aapke liye izzat he, to apki bhaawanaaon kii kadra karte hue vah aapako is rishte kii sahi vajah jarur bataaenge
 Control your tongue in anger
 kyonki kadavi baton ke liye vah aapako maaf kar sakate hai, lekin aisi baaten kabhi bhulaai nahin ja saktin

 Apart from this, Modi is also a member of GST Council

 Some other states do not want this
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘meraa maananaa he ki aagaamee dinon main yah mudda hal ho jayega
 i think petroleum products will soon be a part of GST
 ’’ ek sawaal ke jawaab main modi ne kaha ki unka maananaa he ki petroleum utpaada jiesti ke tahat hone chahie
 However, he added that this is his personal opinion
 duniya bhar main petroleum utpaada jiesti ke daayre main hi aate hai
 Modi chaired the ministerial meeting last month

 However, we turn to the mlas of Delhi
 chunaav ayog ne offis of profit ke maamle main aam aadmi party ke 20 vidhayakon kii sadsyta par raashtrapati ke paas apni sifarish bhej di he
 According to our colleague Hridayesh Joshi, after the recommendation of the Commission, the President has no choice but to sign it
 uske baad adaalat main hi chunauti di ja sakati he
 Let's see the time line of this matter
 - 13 march 2015 ko mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne 21 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv ke taur par niyukt kiya
 - On 19 June 2015, lawyer Prashant Patel petitioned the President that this is a matter of office of profession, ie the membership of these mlas should be canceled
 - 24 june 2015 ko dilli vidhansabha main removal of disqualification amendment bill 2015 paas karke raashtrapati ke paas bheja
 - In this, said to give exemption to Parliamentary Secretaries in Office of Profit case from back date
 - 13 june 2016 ko raashtrapati ne bill par dastakhat karne se manaa kar diya
 - On 25 June 2016, the Central Government sent the bill to the Legislative Assembly
 - 14 se 21 july 2016 ke bich chunaav ayog ne 21 vidhayakon kii personal sunwaayee kii
 - On 8 September 2016, the Delhi High Court quashed the order to appoint 21 mlas as parliamentary secretaries
 - 8 sitambar 2016 ko chunaav ayog ne 21 vidhayakon ko kaaran bataao notice jari kiya
 - On 24 June 2017, the Election Commission rejected the appeal of AAP mlas
 - 9 oktober 2017 ko phir se notice jari kar ayog ne vidhayakon se safai maangi
 - On 19 January 2018, the Commission recommended the cancellation of membership
 hoicourt ne in vidhayakon kii niyukti radd kar di ki up rajyapal ke sin nahin the, isliye avaidh hai
 It was debated that when the appointment itself was illegal then how the office of profit is made
 tark diya gaya ki hoicourt ke avaidh maanane ke pehle tak to aap ke vidhayak us pad par the
 Now the second question is whether the AAP mlas took advantage, ie salary or allowance
 tark diya jaataa he ki inhen cameraa mila tha or kamare ke rakrakhaav par kharch hua tha
 But in many decisions of the Supreme Court it has been clearly said that the post of profit means the MLA is getting the benefit
 kya laabh kaa pad sirf selary se tay hoga, unhen pad par rakhane yaa hataane ke paimaane se nahin hoga
 We do not know what facts the Election Commission has
 laabh ke pad kaa maamla kai baar supreme court pahunchaa he or court ne laabh ke pad kya hai, isaki spasht vyakhya kii he
 On 21 August 1954, the first speaker of the Lok Sabha, GV Mavalankar, after consulting the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, formed a committee for the Office of Profit
 is cameti ke adhyaksh the pandit thakur das bhargav, jinke kaaran ise bhargav cameti kaha jaataa he
 He was an MP from Hisar
 cameti kaa suzav tha ki ek bill laakar saaf kiya jaae ki koun sa pad laabh kaa he or koun sa nahin he
 PDT Acharya has written about it in his book
 supreme court ne offis of profit nirdhaarit karne ke liye kuch test tay kiye hai
 The first test is whether the office is there or not
 doosraa test he ki profit hua yaa nahin
 The most important test is whether the government has appointed
 kya sarkaar vidhayak ko vetan detii he, bhatte kaa bhugtan karti he
 The ideal idea behind the post of profit was that mlas should not do other work because their job is to be in the house and raise the voice of the public
 vah sarkaar ke niyantran main nahin hona chahie
 Otherwise he will not be able to raise public voice
 par kya yah vyaavhaarik rup main bhi lagu hota he
 First, the sessions of the assemblies are also very short
 kya yah naitik aparaadh nahin he
 Not only this, the MLA votes for his party on the basis of whip in the House
 vah janata kaa pratinidhi kaagaj par hota he magar vot party ke wheep ke hisaab se hota he
 Then what does the imagination of office of profit mean
 aap khud bhi sochie
 Once the MLA was appointed to the post of Mayor of Pondicherry
 ise chunaav ayog ne offis of profit mana kyonki kai tarah ke bhatte milte the
 But it was not considered an office of profit because the post of mayor was not under the control of the government
 kul milakar offis of profit kii koi ek maanya vyakhya nahin milti he
 In 2006, Sheila Dikshit gave a variety of posts to the 19 Congress mlas
 sansadeey sachiv se lekar trans yamuna aria deveopment board ke chairman, vaais chairman ke
 After the appointment, the Election Commission sent notice of office of profit to 19 mlas
 shila dikshit apni sarkaar bachaane ke liye ek vidheyak le ain
 14 offices were excluded from the purview of office of profit
 shila dikshit ne kaha tha ki meri sarkaar bachaana meraa haq he or sanvaidhanik taur par aisa kar rahe hai
 Sheila Dixit sent the bill again to the President and was signed
 arvind kejariwal ke saath aisa nahin hua
 They are being accused that no law from retrospective applies
 samvidhan visheshgy pediti acharya kehete hai ki kai rajyon ne pehle niyukti kii or phir baad main kanoon banaakar us pad ko laabh ke pad ke daayre se baahar kiya or adaalat ne bhi mana
 Like there is a case of Congress MLA from Rajasthan Kanta Kathuria
 1969 kaa he
 It was in this case that Kanta Kathuria was appointed to the post of profit
 hoicourt ne offis of profit ke kaaran unki sadsyta radd kar di
 When the appeal was filed in the Supreme Court, the Legislative Assembly passed the law and excluded his post from the purview of profit
 supreme court ne is aadhaar par sadsyta radd nahin kii
 The court said that no such article has been written in article 191, which shows that this declaration cannot be made with retrospective effect, ie you cannot make a law after making an appointment, there is no such thing
 isi tarah kaa bill jharkhand or chhattisgarh main bhi paas hua
 Then why the law made by Arvind Kejriwal government is not valid
 kya offis of profit karpshan he, kya sanvaidhanik naitikta kaa maamla he to phir har rajya main ek hi paimaana hona chahie
 If it is a matter of constitutional morality then there will be one everywhere or the constitutional ethics of different state will be different
 is maamle main bahut kanfusion dikhataa he
 In Haryana also 4 mlas were made Parliamentary Secretaries
 18 july 2017 ko punjab haryana hoicourt ne niyukti radd kar di
 Used to get 50 thousand salary and more than 1 lakh allowance
 lekin kya inaki sadsyta gai, nahin gai magar niyukti radd ho gai
 On 14 November 2017, the Times of India published a report that the Rajasthan High Court has issued a notice to the Chief Secretary, Principal Secretary and Cabinet Secretary in the matter of Parliamentary Secretary
 rajasthan main das sansadeey sachiv banaae gaye hai jinhen rajya mantri kaa darja diya gaya he
 Is this a corruption, is it going to the membership, is the Election Commission doing anything, i have no firm information
 ek maamla or he
 Mamata Banerjee had made 24 mlas as Parliamentary Secretaries before coming back to power
 kanoon bhi lekar ain magar 2013 main ek janhit yachika daayar ho gai
 The Kolkata High Court struck down the law made by Mamta Banerjee
 24 vidhayakon kii niyukti bhi radd ho gai
 On March 2015, 21 mlas of Delhi become Parliamentary Secretaries
 uske do maheene baad may 2015 main chhattisgarh main 11 vidhayakon ko raman singh sarkaar sansadeey sachiv banaati he
 The decision of Chhattisgarh has not come till today, Delhi has come
 1 agast 2017 ko new indian express ne chapa he ki chhattisgarh hai court ne faisla diya he ki sabhi sasandiy sachivon ke adhikaar radd kar die jaaen
 The High Court said that if they are not appointed by the Governor, then their appointment will not be considered valid
 isi tarah kaa faisla to dilli ke vidhayakon ke bare main court ne diya tha

 hoicourt ne vidhayakon ke vyavhaar par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki vidhayak court main maamla lambit hone kii aad le rahe the
 After this, the court refused to give any interim order and now the case will be heard on Monday

 PDT Acharya has written about it in his book
 supreme court ne offis of profit nirdhaarit karne ke liye kuch test tay kiye hai
 The first test is whether the office is there or not
 doosraa test he ki profit hua yaa nahin
 The most important test is whether the government has appointed
 kya sarkaar vidhayak ko vetan detii he, bhatte kaa bhugtan karti he
 The ideal idea behind the post of profit was that mlas should not do other work because their job is to be in the house and raise the voice of the public
 vah sarkaar ke niyantran main nahin hona chahie
 Otherwise he will not be able to raise public voice
 par kya yah vyaavhaarik rup main bhi lagu hota he
 First, the sessions of the assemblies are also very short
 kya yah naitik aparaadh nahin he
 Not only this, the MLA votes for his party on the basis of whip in the House
 vah janata kaa pratinidhi kaagaj par hota he magar vot party ke wheep ke hisaab se hota he
 Then what does the imagination of office of profit mean
 aap khud bhi sochie
 Once the MLA was appointed to the post of Mayor of Pondicherry
 ise chunaav ayog ne offis of profit mana kyonki kai tarah ke bhatte milte the
 But it was not considered an office of profit because the post of mayor was not under the control of the government
 kul milakar offis of profit kii koi ek maanya vyakhya nahin milti he
 In 2006, Sheila Dikshit gave a variety of posts to the 19 Congress mlas

 Like there is a case of Congress MLA from Rajasthan Kanta Kathuria
 1969 kaa he
 It was in this case that Kanta Kathuria was appointed to the post of profit
 hoicourt ne offis of profit ke kaaran unki sadsyta radd kar di
 When the appeal was filed in the Supreme Court, the Legislative Assembly passed the law and excluded his post from the purview of profit
 supreme court ne is aadhaar par sadsyta radd nahin kii
 The court said that no such article has been written in article 191, which shows that this declaration cannot be made with retrospective effect, ie you cannot make a law after making an appointment, there is no such thing
 isi tarah kaa bill jharkhand or chhattisgarh main bhi paas hua
 Then why the law made by Arvind Kejriwal government is not valid
 kya offis of profit karpshan he, kya sanvaidhanik naitikta kaa maamla he to phir har rajya main ek hi paimaana hona chahie
 If it is a matter of constitutional morality then there will be one everywhere or the constitutional ethics of different state will be different

 According to him, the Election Commission has sought an answer from the Madhya Pradesh government whether 109 mlas and 9 ministers fall under the purview of Office of Profit
 tippaniyan Madhya Pradesh was asked by the Election Commission on the complaint of the Aam Aadmi Party

 hoicourt ne vidhayakon ke vyavhaar par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki vidhayak court main maamla lambit hone kii aad le rahe the
 After this, the court refused to give any interim order and now the case will be heard on Monday
 hoicourt ne in vidhayakon kii niyukti radd kar di ki up rajyapal ke sin nahin the, isliye avaidh hai
 It was debated that when the appointment itself was illegal then how the office of profit is made
 tark diya gaya ki hoicourt ke avaidh maanane ke pehle tak to aap ke vidhayak us pad par the
 Now the second question is whether the AAP mlas took advantage, ie salary or allowance
 tark diya jaataa he ki inhen cameraa mila tha or kamare ke rakrakhaav par kharch hua tha
 But in many decisions of the Supreme Court it has been clearly said that the post of profit means the MLA is getting the benefit
 kya laabh kaa pad sirf selary se tay hoga, unhen pad par rakhane yaa hataane ke paimaane se nahin hoga
 We do not know what facts the Election Commission has
 laabh ke pad kaa maamla kai baar supreme court pahunchaa he or court ne laabh ke pad kya hai, isaki spasht vyakhya kii he

 laabh ke pad ke peeche adarsh kalpana yah thi ki vidhayak duusare kaam na karen kyonki uskaa kaam sadan main hona or janata kii awaz uthaanaa he
 He should not be under the control of the government
 varanaa vah janata kii awaz nahin uthaa paaegaa
 But does this also apply in practical terms
 awwal to vidhansabhaon ke satr bhi bahut kam dinon ke hote hai
 Is it not a moral offense? yahi nahin, vidhayak sadan main wheep ke aadhaar par apni party ke liye vot karata he
 He is the representative of the people on paper but the vote is according to the whip of the party
 phir offis of profit kii kalpana kaa kya matlab rah jaataa he
 Think for yourself
 ek baar pandicherry ke meyar pad par vidhayak kii niyukti ho gai
 This was considered by the Election Commission as the Office of Profit because many allowances were available
 magar ise offis of profit nahin mana gaya kyonki meyar kaa pad sarkaar ke niyantran main nahin aata tha
 Overall there is no valid interpretation of the Office of Profit
 2006 main shila dikshit ne congress ke 19 vidhayakon ko kai prakaar ke pad die
 From Parliamentary Secretary to Chairman of Trans Yamuna Area Development Board, Vice Chairman
 niyukti ke baad chunaav ayog ne 19 vidhayakon ko offis of profit kaa notice bhej diya
 Sheila Dixit brought a bill to save her government
 14 karyaalayon ko offis of profit ke daayre se baahar kar diya
 Sheila Dixit had said that it is my right to save my government and are doing so constitutionally
 shila dikshit ne raashtrapati ko vidheyak dobaaraa bheja or dastakhat ho gaya
 This did not happen to Arvind Kejriwal
 un par aarope lag rahaa he ki retrospective se koi kanoon nahin lagu hota
 Constitutional expert PDT Acharya says that many states made the appointment first and then later made that law out of the purview of the post of profit and the court accepted it
 jaise rajasthan ke congress vidhayak kanta kathuria kaa ek maamla he
 Is of 1969
 is cese main hua ki kanta cathuria kii laabh ke pad par niyukti hui
 The High Court canceled his membership due to the Office of Profit
 supreme court main apil daayar hui tab vidhansabha ne kanoon paas kar unke pad ko laabh ke daayre se hi baahar kar diya
 The Supreme Court did not cancel the membership on this basis
 court ne kaha ki artical 191 main aisa kahin nahin likhaa he jisase pataa chalata he ki yah ghoshnaa retrospective effect se nahin ho sakati yani aap niyukti karne ke baad kanoon nahin bana sakate, aisa kahin nahin he
 a similar bill was also passed in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh
 phir arvind kejariwal sarkaar kaa banaaya kanoon kyon nahin maanya he
 What is the office of profit corruption, is it a matter of constitutional ethics, then every state should have the same scale
 agar yah sanvaidhanik naitikta kaa maamla he to har jagah ek hoga yaa alag-alag rajya kii sanvaidhanik naitikta alag-alag hogi
 There is a lot of confusion in this case
 haryana main bhi 4 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banaaya gaya
 On 18 July 2017, the Punjab Haryana High Court canceled the appointment
 50 hazaar selary milti thi or 1 lakh se zyaada bhatta miltaa tha
 But did his membership go or not, but the appointment was canceled
 14 november 2017 ko times of india ne isaki khabar chhaapi he ki rajasthan hoicourt ne vahaan ke mukhya sachiv, pradhan sachiv or cabinet sachiv ko sansadeey sachiv ke maamle main notice jari kiya he
 There are ten parliamentary secretaries in Rajasthan who have been given the status of Minister of State
 kya yah koi karpshan he, kya inaki sadsyta ja rahi he, chunaav ayog kuch kar rahaa he, mere paas koi pukhta jaankaree nahin he
 There is one more case
 mamata banerjee ne dobaaraa satta main aane se pehle 24 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv bana diya tha
 Laws were also brought but in 2013 a PIL was filed
 kolkata hoicourt ne mamata banerjee ke banaae kanoon ko radd kar diya
 The appointment of 24 mlas was also canceled
 march 2015 ko dilli ke 21 vidhayak sansadeey sachiv banate hai
 Two months after that, in May 2015, the Raman Singh government appoints 11 mlas in Chhattisgarh as parliamentary secretaries
 chhattisgarh kaa faisla aaj tak nahin aayaa, dilli kaa aa gaya
 On 1 August 2017, the New Indian Express has published that the Chhattisgarh High Court has decided that the rights of all the secretaries should be revoked
 hoicourt ne kaha ki agar inaki niyukti garvanar se nahin hui he to inaki niyukti vaid nahin maani jaaegi
 a similar decision was given by the court regarding the mlas of Delhi
 27 june 2017 kii ek khabar mili
 From Telegraph and Times of India
 uske anusaar chunaav ayog ne madhya pradesh sarkaar se jawaab maanga he ki kya 109 vidhayak or 9 mantri offis of profit ke daayre main aate hai
 The comments aam aadmi party kii shikaayat par chunaav ayog ne madhyapradesh se poocha tha
 The Aam Aadmi Party's complaint was that 116 mlas were members of the Jan Bhagidari Samiti, which is a post of profit and two ministers were appointed commissioners of Scouts and Guides
 kya bijli mantri paras jain or schuli shiksha mantri deepak joshi ne laabh ke pad kaa ulanghan kiya he
 We do not know when the Election Commission has taken the final stand in terms of the post of profit in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 sadsyta radd hone kii khabar sunne ke baad aap ke kuch vidhayak dilli hoicourt gaye, hoicourt ne chunaav ayog se aadesh ke bare main poocha to chunaav ayog ke vakil ne kaha ki abhi der shaam ko chunaav ayog se unka sampark nahin ho sakaa he or unhen samay diya jaae 
 The High Court questioned the behavior of the mlas, saying that the mlas were under the guise of pending the case in court
 iske baad court ne koi bhi antarim aadesh dene se inkaar kar diya or ab maamle kii sunwaayee somvaar ko hogi
 In 2006, Sheila Dikshit gave a variety of posts to the 19 Congress mlas
 sansadeey sachiv se lekar trans yamuna aria deveopment board ke chairman, vaais chairman ke
 After the appointment, the Election Commission sent notice of office of profit to 19 mlas
 shila dikshit apni sarkaar bachaane ke liye ek vidheyak le ain
 14 offices were excluded from the purview of office of profit
 shila dikshit ne kaha tha ki meri sarkaar bachaana meraa haq he or sanvaidhanik taur par aisa kar rahe hai
 Sheila Dixit sent the bill again to the President and was signed
 arvind kejariwal ke saath aisa nahin hua
 They are being accused that no law from retrospective applies
 samvidhan visheshgy pediti acharya kehete hai ki kai rajyon ne pehle niyukti kii or phir baad main kanoon banaakar us pad ko laabh ke pad ke daayre se baahar kiya or adaalat ne bhi mana
 Like there is a case of Congress MLA from Rajasthan Kanta Kathuria
 1969 kaa he
 It was in this case that Kanta Kathuria was appointed to the post of profit
 hoicourt ne offis of profit ke kaaran unki sadsyta radd kar di
 When the appeal was filed in the Supreme Court, the Legislative Assembly passed the law and excluded his post from the purview of profit
 supreme court ne is aadhaar par sadsyta radd nahin kii
 The court said that no such article has been written in article 191, which shows that this declaration cannot be made with retrospective effect, ie you cannot make a law after making an appointment, there is no such thing
 isi tarah kaa bill jharkhand or chhattisgarh main bhi paas hua
 Then why the law made by Arvind Kejriwal government is not valid
 kya offis of profit karpshan he, kya sanvaidhanik naitikta kaa maamla he to phir har rajya main ek hi paimaana hona chahie
 If it is a matter of constitutional morality then there will be one everywhere or the constitutional ethics of different state will be different
 is maamle main bahut kanfusion dikhataa he
 In Haryana also 4 mlas were made Parliamentary Secretaries
 18 july 2017 ko punjab haryana hoicourt ne niyukti radd kar di
 Used to get 50 thousand salary and more than 1 lakh allowance
 lekin kya inaki sadsyta gai, nahin gai magar niyukti radd ho gai
 On 14 November 2017, the Times of India published a report that the Rajasthan High Court has issued a notice to the Chief Secretary, Principal Secretary and Cabinet Secretary in the matter of Parliamentary Secretary

 Is this a corruption, is it going to the membership, is the Election Commission doing anything, i have no firm information

 Sheila Dixit sent the bill again to the President and was signed
 arvind kejariwal ke saath aisa nahin hua
 They are being accused that no law from retrospective applies
 samvidhan visheshgy pediti acharya kehete hai ki kai rajyon ne pehle niyukti kii or phir baad main kanoon banaakar us pad ko laabh ke pad ke daayre se baahar kiya or adaalat ne bhi mana
 For example, there is a case of Congress MLA from Rajasthan Kanta Kathuria 
 1969 kaa he
 It was in this case that Kanta Kathuria was appointed to the post of profit
 hoicourt ne offis of profit ke kaaran unki sadsyta radd kar di
 When the appeal was filed in the Supreme Court, the Legislative Assembly passed the law and excluded his post from the purview of profit
 supreme court ne is aadhaar par sadsyta radd nahin kii
 The court said that no such article has been written in article 191, which shows that this declaration cannot be made with retrospective effect, ie you cannot make a law after making an appointment, there is no such thing
 isi tarah kaa bill jharkhand or chhattisgarh main bhi paas hua
 Then why the law made by Arvind Kejriwal government is not valid
 kya offis of profit karpshan he, kya sanvaidhanik naitikta kaa maamla he to phir har rajya main ek hi paimaana hona chahie
 If it is a matter of constitutional morality then there will be one everywhere or the constitutional ethics of different state will be different

 After the return of the three states of the country to the Congress, there was hope for the Congress that its claim in the Grand Alliance in Uttar Pradesh would be strong, its aspirations seem to be revolving
 soobe main sapa-basapa ke saath hone vaale gathbandhan main congress ko darkinar kiya ja saktaa he
 The seats formula in the SP-BSP alliance has almost been decided
 mana ja rahaa he gathbandhan kaa aupchaarik elaan mayawati ke janmdin par ho saktaa he
 According to BSP sources, the alliance with SP-BSP in UP and the formula for seats has been decided
 is formule ke tahat congress ke liye amethi or raibareli chhod sakate hai
 Apart from this, Chaudhary Ajit Singh's party RLD can get 2 to 3 seats
 areldi ke khate main bagpat, mujffarnagar or kairana sansadeey siten di jaaegi
 If sources are to be believed, both the parties have decided seats for themselves in the 80 Lok Sabha seats of the state
 ek formule ke mutabik bispi 38 or sapa 37 siton par chunavi ladegi
 Whereas under the second formula, BSP will contest 39 and SP 37 seats
 aisi sthiti main areldi ko 2 siten mil sakati he
 It is being said that a consensus has been reached between the top leaders of both the parties on this formula
 sapa or basapa- donon partiyaan congress ke saath upi main gathbandhan karne ke mood main nahin he
 In the recently held assembly elections of five states, both the parties did not contest elections together with the Congress
 haalanki nateezon ke baad donon partiyon ne rajasthan or madhya pradesh main congress ko samarthan diya he
 In such a situation, the Congress may have to enter the electoral fray alone in Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki gathbandhan kii gunjaaish bani rahe, is lihaaja se sapa-basapa congress ke garh amethi or raibareli main gathbandhan pratyaashee nahin utaarengi
 Also, SP can give some seats in its quota to other smaller parties like Nishad Party, Peace Party
 basapa har saal mayawati ke janmdin ko bahut dhoomdhaam se manaati he
 On the same day, Mayawati releases a blue book in which her work and ideological perspective of BSP is kept in front of every year
 loksabhaa chunaav ke lihaaj se is baar ek bada aayojan kar sakati he
 Leaders of non-congress and non-bjp parties can be invited to this event

 fasebuk / cambridge analitica scandle to kuch hi din purana he, lekin yah masalaa saal 2013 / 2014 kaa he
 Cambridge Analytica Cogan, an academic at Cambridge University, was tasked with developing an app that could be used to conduct a personality quiz-like survey among Facebook users
 kareeb 2,70,000 americanyon ne ap downlod kiya or survey main hissaa liya
 He also gave the app access to his friends' likes and comments
 is takanic kaa istemaal karte hue ap ne kul 5 karod logon ke data hasil kar liye
 The data was also shared with Cambridge Analytica
 cambridge analitica ek kansalting company he jo aise rajnatik dalon or think tanks ko sevaayen detii he, jinhen logon ke profile taiyaar karne or unase sampark banane kii jarurat hoti he
 With the help of Cambridge Analytica's data, these organizations could now target citizens closely based on certain beliefs and opinions — details for this were obtained from Facebook data
 ab sawaal yah he ki pehle hi charan main fasebuk kaa data hasil karnaa kis tarah se sambhav he? asal main yujar quij kaa ap downlod karata tha or quij main hissaa letaa tha
 Whenever we install an app, it asks you for permission to give access to your Facebook data and most of the time it happens that people immediately click "yes" without understanding its result
 to is tarah yujar jab kisi ap ko aisi ijaajat de detaa he to fasebuk bhi us ap ko apane data ko khangaalane kii ijaajat detaa he
 In the case of Cambridge Analytica, Facebook banned it in 2015, when it came to know about the game of this app and what this data was being used for
 fasebuk ne cambridge analitica se yah anurodh bhi kiya ki vah is tarah se hasil data ko delit kar de, lekin lagata nahin ki cambridge analitica ne aisa kiya
 Instead, it seems that he used this data to provide various services to his customers
 to sawaal uthta he ki kya ise data chori kahenge, kyonki aakhir yujar ne iske liye ap ko parmishan diya tha? yaa yah bharose ke saath ghaat karne kaa maamla he, jisamen yujar yah samajhataa tha ki uskaa data nijee he or use fasebuk kisi or se saajha nahin karegaa? kya fasebuk ne apane yugers ko is bare main puri jaankaree di thi ki unka or unke doston kaa data, unki profiling or unhen prabhavit karne liye istemaal kiya ja rahaa he?ab ham ek aisi duniya main pravesh kar rahe hai jisamen data kaa visphot hota dikh rahaa he
 We ourselves are generating huge amounts of data every second, like when we are browsing the internet, doing some searches, using e-mail, ordering something on an e-commerce site, buying tickets online, online banking Or do credit card transactions, etc
 or bhavishya main to ham par aise internet of things (ioti) se nigaraanee rakhi jane vaali he, jo hamaare har taraf honge or kai baar to hamaare sharir main bhi ho sakate hai
 The privacy we have known so far has died in the digital world
 data kaa istemaal kar ham logon par nigaraanee rakh sakate hai or kaaphi had tak unke vyavhaar kaa bhi anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 For this reason, some people are now considering "data as new oil"
 hamen apane data ke bare main "data adhikaar'' kii baat kerani chahie
 We have seen clearly that data about us can be misused, even it can shake the foundation of modern society - its democratic institutions
 ham 1
 There are 3 billion people and our population is generating huge amounts of data

 madhya pradesh kii rajdhani bhopal main mangalvaar raat ek gaadi se badi maatra main cash baraamad kiya gaya
 The incident occurred late Tuesday but the police revealed the case on Wednesday
 bhopal krime branch ke eespi nishchal jhaaria ke mutabik unhen khufia jaankaree mili thi ki ek car ke jariye cash bhopal se mumbai ja rahaa he
 On the basis of information, the police traced the car by putting a barricade near the noose toll block outside Bhopal and then the whole matter was revealed
 krime branch eespi nishchal jhaaria ke mutabik, unhen kaaphi pehle is baat kii jaankaree mili thi kii har hafte bhopal se ek car mumbai jaati he
 The person who gave the information told the Crime Branch that once a week at exactly 8:00 in the evening, a car of Maharashtra number goes through Indore's Red Valley area of bhopal and then towards Mumbai
 iske baad isi raste se waapas hote hue car bhopal aa jaati he
 Night time is chosen for leaving Mumbai from Bhopal and coming back from Mumbai to Bhopal

 At the bottom of the seat, the car was modified to create boxed structures where the money was hidden inside

 Former captain Sourav Ganguly today denied the possibility of any pressure on Sachin Tendulkar after the retirement of three members of the 'fab Four' of the Indian middle order, saying here that this star batsman can remain in the team for as long as he wants is
 ganguli ne kaha, ‘sachin jab tak chahen tab tak khel sakate hai
 He is a very big player
 main nahin samajhataa ki faib four ke teen khilaadiyon ke sanyas lene ke baad un par kisi tarah kaa dabaav hoga
 If three players retire, it does not mean that they should also do so
 tendulkar ke alaava swayan ganguli, rahul dravid or vivies lakshmana faib four ke sadsy the
 Of these, Ganguly retired in 2008 while Dravid and Laxman quit international cricket this year
 ganguli ne iske saath hi is suzav ko bhi nakaar diya ki haal main under-19 vishwa cap khilne vaale khilaadiyon ko kam se kam twanti-20 match khilne chahie
 He said, 'I do not believe that anyone has the right to prevent a player from playing in any format
 unmukt chand ne final main jo chah chakke lagaaye the vah sabhi krij par khadey hokar lagaaye the
 It is today's cricket, whoever plays in modern times, it is necessary to play in every format
 ganguli ne twanti-20 ke test cricket par padane vaale kisi tarah ke nakaaratmak prabhaav kii baat maanane se bhi inkaar kar diya
 He asked the opposite, 'would you like to see Chris Gayle and Virender Sehwag or Geoffrey Boycott? aaj kii cricket teji se ran banane se judi he or khilaadi ko yah pataa hona chahie ki vah khud ko prayek praaroop ke anuroop kaise dhaal paata he

 com / D0jdwdxisa— mustafa (@thatboymusty)february 7, 2019 During the freedom struggle, the British organized several round table conferences which had their own definite objectives and which influenced Indian politics in their own way
 yah aalekh golmes sammelan ke dauraan hui kuch chutili or mjedaar ghatnaon kaa sankalan bhar he jo mahatma gandhi se judi hui hai
 The matter is from 1931
 bharat main swatantraaa aandolan ugr ho rahaa tha, gandhi kaa namak satyagrah puraa ho chukaa tha or bhagat singh ko faansee di ja chuki thi
 The British government was busy preparing for the second round table and wanted to make it a success
 chunki pehle golmes main gandhi ne hissaa nahin liya tha to wo ek flop sho sabit hua tha or isiilie angrej chaahate the ki us golmes sammelan main gandhi hissaa jarur len
 Here Gandhi wanted to seduce the British for his participation in the round table till the last moment
 british khufia agent, patrkaar or raajnneetik kaaryakarta har roj gandhi ke kaaryakramon main hissaa lete the or kuch khabar nikaalane kii koshish karte the ki kya gandhi duusare golmes sammelan main hissaa lenge? lekin gandhi the ki kisi ko bhanak nahin lagane de rahe the!usee saal garmiyon main jab suraj aag ugal rahaa tha, ek din gandhi ne apane dainik kriyakalapon ke bich achaanak kasturba se kaha- ba, garam kapade taiyaar karvaa dena! ek noujvaan patrkaar ne ye baat sun lee or usne news agenciyon ko ye khabar de di ki mahatma, dwitiya golmes sammelan main hissaa lene vaale hai
 Because at that time it was getting hot in India and there was no question of getting hot clothes ready
 garam kapadon kii jarurat main landan main hi pad sakati thi
 The name of that young journalist was Durgadas
 ye vahiin durgadas the jo aage chalakar hindustan times jaise akhbaar ke sampadak bane or baad main jinhone press club kii sthapana main mukhya bhoomika nibhaai
 The story of the failure of the Second Round Table Conference and Gandhi's opposition to the British in it is well known
 lekin gandhi kii us landan yatra ke dauraan do-teen dilachasp ghatnaayen hui jise itihaas main bahut jagah nahin mila pai he
 Gandhi used his journey to achieve every platform where he could put the question of India's independence in front of the world
 is silsile main vah england main vipakshi dal ke netaaon, gaiyr-sarkari sanghathanon, british press or har us vyakti se mili jo unase mil sakate the
 Winston Churchill was not the only one who did not like Gandhi
 lekin gandhi ji ko british samraat se jorge pancham se milane kaa samay jarur mil gaya
 The secretary of the emperor had strongly advised Gandhi to dress properly and appear before the emperor and take care of protocol
 lekin gandhi ne jaanboojhkar uskaa paalan nahin kiya or ve fakir ke vesh main hi samraat se milane pahunch gaye
 That meeting of Gandhi and the British Emperor was a monologue, he had to hear the allegations of unrest in India with a single George v and got advice
 gandhi ne muskuraakar samraat se kaha ki ve to bhartiya janata ko ahimsa kaa paath padhaa rahe hai jo uski pracheen jeevanstyli he
 Well, when Gandhi came out of the palace after that brief meeting, the British press surrounded him and asked a variety of questions
 ek patrkaar ne vyangy se kaha ki- “mistar gandhi, aap to england main rahe bhi hai
 At least you had to dress properly
 samraat ke saamne sabhy tareeke se pesh hona chahie tha”
 Gandhi's answer to this was - the cloth of my part was worn by the emperor! Cut the press and not blood! Very few newspapers dared to publish such an answer to Gandhi! During that visit of Gandhi, someone got him to meet the famous star of English films Charlie Chaplin
 charlie ne bharat kii aazaadee ko lekar gandhi ke prayaason kii saraahna kii or gandhi se poocha ki ve mashiinon ko lekar itane shankaalu kyon hai? gandhi ne jawaab diya ki ve mashiinon ke virdohi nahin hai lekin ve mashiinon kii vajah se ek insaan dwaara duusare insaan ke shoshan ke virdohi hai
 Growing up in the industrial environment of america-europe, Charlie Chaplin did not understand these things at that time
 lekin chaar saal baad yani san 1936 main charlie ne ek film kaa nirmaan, nirdesan kiya or usamen abhinay bhi kiya jiskaa naam tha- “modern times”
 In that film, the machine, unemployment and struggle of one man are shown in a poignant manner
 kai saalon ke baad charlie chaplinake jeevanikar ne likhaa ki shaayad paanch saal pehle landan main gandhi se hui mulaakaat kaa ye asar tha ki charlie jaise mahaan filmkaar ne modern times naam kii wo film banaai thi
 That evening in London, that fakir of Hindustan was overshadowed by that film superstar! So Mahatma Gandhi was one whose influence on the big superstars and emperors of that era was also impressive

 Obamas' letter in this regard was handed over to Karzai by US Ambassador to Afghanistan Ryan Crocker on Thursday afternoon
 rashtriya suraksha parishad ke pravaktaa tony vitor ne yah jaankaree di he
 Vitor said, "after the phone conversation on February 20, the President has sent a letter to Karzai asking to continue the broad discussion on the issues related to our long-term relationship

 19 girls have been murdered in the last two months in Greater Noida near Delhi
 or ye 19 laashen bas hi ek sawaal puch rahi hai
 Who am I? Who is my murderer? What is this murder mystery? The mysterious murder that started in the state of Greater Noida on January 2, almost exactly from the capital of the country, is not taking the name of ending even on the 19th count
 in do maheenon main ausatan har duusare, chauthe or chathe din ek naa ek laash zarur saamne aa rahi he
 That body is also only for girls and women
 pahchaan ko taras rahi 19 laashenis khaufnak sach ko or bhi khaufnak bana detii he greater noida kii police
 Yes yes do maheene main 19 laashon batorne ke baavjood kaatil yaa katl kaa makasad to chhodie police un laashon ke chehre yaa unke naam tak nahin dhund pai he
 19 corpses of 19 are still craving their identity
 lihaaza is silsilewar katl kaa sach jaanane ke liye vaardaat kii team ne apni tafteesh bhi shuru kar di
 Our team started collecting information about all the locations from where the corpses were being found
 tafteesh ke baad hamane kuch ajeeb chijen pain
 For example, all the bodies were found within a range of 15 to 20 kilometers - but the bodies were thrown at different places - the method of killing was also different - some were strangled and some were crushed with stones - some bodies were clothes i found some half-baked goods - some corpses were also found - but no corpse was found from any corpse - most of the corpses were also burnt - that is, the killer wanted to erase their identity
 a contender Ailason But, the most shocking thing was that Greater despite hitting exploring all the villages and towns of Noida was not a house where there is missing a girl in the last two months
 yahaan tak ki police ne aasapaas ke jilon ke thanon ko bhi khangaal maaraa
 But no such thing was found that resembles Maktool
 ab aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya sari laashen yaa sari makatool doordaraj kii hai? par kitni dur? kya koi purvi uttar pradesh, bihar, rajasthan, uttarakhand jaise dur-daraaj ilaake se laashen laakar yahaan phenk saktaa he? kya ye mumkin he? yaa phir koi sirphira he jo dur-daraaj se ladakiyon ko dhokhe se apane saath yahaan laata he or maar daalata he? ya phir ye saare katl alag-alag logon ne alag-alag vajahon se kiye? yaa kahin kaatil police ko uljhane ke liye to alag-alag tareeke se katl nahin kar rahaa he?2 janvari se shuru hua silsilis serial kiling kaa silsilaa shuru hota he isi saal 2 janvari ko
 When the corpse of the first girl is found
 shuru main police ko yahi lagata he ki maamla aam katl kaa he
 Accordingly, she also investigates the case
 magar phir duusari laash milti he
 Then third, then fourth, then fifth
 or aakhri laash milti he aath march ko
 And with this the count of corpses reaches 19
 2 janvari 2014, saal kaa doosraa din
 The first corpse is found from the Garhi Pushte area of greater Noida
 lash ek ladki kii thi
 The morning news of the body being found dead also disturbed the police and she immediately ran towards the incident
 
 
 lekin laash kii haalat dekh kar uske qadam thithak gaye
 
 
 This corpse was very old and rotten, while it was a busy road where the corpse lay
 behad buree haalat main thi lapaise main police ke saamne ab ek bada sawaal tha
 The question was, how was a corpse lying on such a busy road for so many days? Why did not anyone notice? Or did someone bring the old corpse here? To solve the puzzle of this corpse, the police sent him for postmortem
 lekin police ko tab doosraa jhatka laga jab forensik medicin ke exparts ne use bataaya ki laash kii haalat kuch itani buree he ki sirf postmortem se uski maut kii vajah kaa pataa lagaana mumkin nahin he
 But this was just the beginning
 pehali laash ko mili abhi haftaa bhi nahin beetaa tha ki police ko greater noida ke hi sector 24 main ek footpath par ek or ladki kii laash milti he
 
 
 The condition of this corpse was not so bad, but the murderer burned Maktool's face with the intention of hiding his identity
 police ne is laash ke peeche kii kahani pataa karne ke liye bhi har jatan kiye, lekin koi phayda nahin hua
 The faces of some corpses are badly burnt, and then another corpse is exposed
 ye laash ek garbhvatee mahila kii thi, jo pari chowk ke nazadik ek park se mili thi
 Generally, this park is buzzing with people all the time
 aise main is bhari aabaadi ke bich ek park main garbhvatee mahila kii laash milanaa kisi paheli se kam nahin tha
 But this process of finding dead bodies of girls in Greater Noida will become a never ending mystery series, nobody was mistaken about it
 lekin iske baad hua kuch aisa hi
 
 
 The next month i
e
 from February 1 to March 8, a total of 19 dead bodies were found in Greater Noida, one by one
 
 
 or hairaani kii baat ye ki in sabhi kii sabhi 19 laashon ke bare main police ko aisa ek bhi suraag nahin mil sakaa, jisase wo qaatil tak pahunch paati
 Rather, leave a clue that the police have not been able to identify even a single death in 19 murder cases
 ulate har nae maamle ke saath ladakiyon kii laashen milane kaa ye silsilaa lagaataar pechida hi hota ja rahaa
 Somewhere the corpse was without clothes, somewhere the face burned badly and each time the murderer managed to escape by disposing the corpses
 pehle-pahal maamle ko halke main lenevaali police ke ab haath paanv ab babbti ginati ke saath phoolne lage hai
 Cases of blind murder at the same time have kept her entangled
 to kya ye qatl kisi aise serial killer kaa kaam he, jo ladakiyon se nafrat karata he? or har baar apane shikaar ko kuch alag tareeke se maut detaa he
 
 
 Six teams of Noida and Greater Noida police are now looking for answers to these questions

 Whether the former Indian team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be in the 2019 World Cup squad is not yet decided, but former team opener Virender Sehwag believes that the team still has to find the 'right option for Dhoni', Sehwag In an interview, i do not think any player can replace Dhoni at the moment
 rishabh pant achche hai, lekin unhen dhoni kii jagah lene ke liye abhi or samay chahie
 This can only happen after the World Cup
 hamen dhoni ke vikalp ke bare main 2019 ke baad hi sochna chahie
 Till then, Pant should have experienced that Dhoni should remain fit
 He said that fans should pray that Dhoni should be fit, he should not worry about whether he is scoring or not
 sahvaag ne kaha, 'dhoni ran bana rahe hai yaa nahin hamen yah chintaa nahin kerani chahie
 We should just pray that Dhoni stays fit till the 2019 World Cup
 madhyakram or nichle kram main jo anubhav dhoni ke paas he vah kisi anya ke paas nahin
 '

 You have to deal with that
 kabhi aisa samay hota he jab aap dheron ran banaate hai or kabhi aisa samay aata he jab aap ran banane ke liye taras jate he
 The same happens in business, every year you do not make a profit

" '' unhone kaha, ‘‘har chunaav main desh kii suraksha par hameshaa charchaa hui he
 Defending the repeated mention of Pakistan and the army in the Prime Minister's speeches, Gadkari said, "india has had to respond to recent terrorist activities in Pakistan

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator Assembly and Lok Sabha elections were held simultaneously on 10 April and 17 April in the state
 yah chunaav puri tarah se do sawaalon par kendrit the
 First, will Naveen Patnaik, who wants to become the Chief Minister of Odisha for the fourth time, be able to make history? Second, will the Narendra Modi wave manage to get BJP some seats in the state where the party's account was not even opened in 2009? The debate finally came to an end on May 16 when Naveen's Biju Janata Dal (BJD) ) Won the assembly easily and won 19 out of the 21 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 rajya vidhansabha main mahaj 18 siten hasil kar congress haashie par chali gai he, jabaki loksabhaa kii ek seat bhi usko nahin mili he
 On the other hand, BJP won 11 assembly and 2 Lok Sabha seats
 chunaav nateezon ke lambey intjaar ke baad aakhirkaar yah saaf dikh gaya ki naveen ne modi lahar or kisi bhi tarah kii satta virdohi lahar ko maat de di he
 His victory is indeed a pleasant one as not only has he gone ahead with 103 seats in the 2009 assembly and 14 seats in the Lok Sabha, but he has emerged as the strongest leader in 2014 in dealing with all the mess
 naveen ne lagaataar chauthi jeet kii patakatha akele hi taiyaar kii
 His critics also believe this because Naveen's 'chanakya' officer-turned-politician Pyari Mohan Mahapatra has also left him
 2012 se pehle hi mukhyamantri ne mahapaatr ko khulkar khilne kii chhot di thi jisase vah ek samanaantar satta centre banakar ubhare the
 However, when Naveen was far away in London, an attempt was made to reverse his power, which failed
 iske baad naveen ne furti dikhaate hue june, 2012 main mahapaatr ko nilambit kar diya
 Mahapatra was eventually thrown out of the party, ending Naveen's 12-year relationship with a man who claimed to have taught the Chief Minister the politics
 mahapaatr ne apana alag rajnatik dal orissa jan morcha (ojeem) banaaya or naveen tathaa bijedy ke khilaaf aag ugalate rahe, lekin vidhansabha or loksabhaa donon main shunya par rahane ke baad ve ab vah puri tarah se alag-thalag pad sakate hai
 Naveen began a political career as a man who was not considered a fluent speaker of Odia and had hardly any experience in public life
 is tarah se yahaan tak pahunchane main unhone kaaphi lanbaa safar tay kiya he
 The 67-year-old bachelor leader has changed the definition of politics in Odisha over the years
 apane pita biju patnayak kii rajnatik viraasat sanbhaalane ke baavjood naveen ke paas apane parivaar ke hit saadhane jaisaa kuch bhi nahin
 When he first became the Chief Minister in March 2000, Odisha was considered an extremely poor state, with a per capita income of just Rs 14,862 in 1999-2000
 thi
 It has now increased to Rs 26,900 in 2011-12
 tak pahunch chuki he
 In September 2013, the Reserve Bank named Odisha as the most attractive investment destination for new projects
 mahilaon ko lakshya banaakar yojanaayen chalaa karke unhone yah sunishchit kiya ki congress kabhi bhi satta main vaapasi na kar paae, jo rajya main 2000 main satta se baahar ho gai thi
 Naveen, who has continuously run the government in Odisha after assuming power, gave a favorable rule at the grassroots level to deal with the anti-incumbency wave as he knew that today's politics is a snake-ladder game
 bharat main sabase lambey samay tak mukhyamantri rahane ke maamle main ve bas sipiem ke diggaj netaa divangat jyoti basu se hi peeche rah gaye hai
 Once called a politically novice (naveen), the Chief Minister has once again been considered a skilled strategist after leading the BJD victory
 party ab apane 17wein saal main pravesh kar gai he or satta main uskaa 14waan saal he
 She has become stronger than before
 duusare khandaani netaaon ke vipareet naveen ne apana rajnatik kariyar apane pita kii 1997 main hui maut ke baad shuru kiya
 He returned from the US and founded BJD on 26 December 1997
 virodhiyon ne unka majaak udaaya, yahaan tak ki unki party ke chunaav chinh (shankh) kaa bhi majaak banaaya gaya
 But because of the way he transformed the state, Damodar Raut, who was once an outspoken critic, had to come with him
 raut philhal rajya ke swasthya mantri hai
 Naveen, who has created an image of himself as an advocate of the poor, is also a stern avenger
 naveen shaayad hi kabhi apane dushmano ko bhoolatey hai
 In the early days, he removed the party's co-founder and critic Bijay Mahapatra from Patakuda Assembly seat in 2000 to replace Atanu Sabyasachi as the BJD candidate and expelled Mahapatra from the party
 bijay ab bhi is jatke se ubar nahin paae hai
 He had contested the Mahakalpada seat as a BJP candidate in 2014 after losing elections to Patkuda twice in 2004 and 2009
 pichley varshon main naveen ne apane virodhiyon ko nibatane kaa kaam bahut baariki se kiya he
 Just before the general elections in March 2009, he broke the bjd's 12-year-old alliance with the BJP
 naveen ne 2008 ke kandhamal dangon ko badhaava dene main bijepi kii kathith bhoomika ke aadhaar par use sampradayik qaraar de diya
 Leaving the BJD at the last minute, the BJP was in disarray and in 2009 it failed to win even a single Lok Sabha seat while winning only six seats in the 147-member assembly
 naveen kii prashasnic khyaati aktubar 2013 main or bad gai jab unhone fallin chakravaat ke raste main aane vaale ganjam, puri or khurda jile main ek lakh se zyada logon ko prabhavi tareeke se baahar nikaala
 His readiness and planning in advance was a stark contrast to the Congress government led by Girdhar Gamang, during whose rule over 10,000 people died in October 1999 when the super cyclone hit Odisha
 naveen patnayak kii ranneeti main samay hameshaa kaaphi mahatvapurn rahaa he
 This time, in the preparations for a double election, he deftly did not give tickets to 35 BJD mlas so that public anger against them would not be affected
 ve yaheen nahin ruke, duusare dalon se jitu patnayak, bimbadhar kuker, golak nayak, hema gamang or sarat mishra jaise netaaon ko laakar unhone un dalon ko to kamjor kiya or isse apana aadhaar bhi badhaayaa
 In such a situation, when the BJP is going to form the government with a huge victory, they have not opened their cards about what Naveen will do in Delhi
 haalanki, ek cheez to nishchit haih orissa naveen kii jholii main he or aage bhi aisa hi rahane kii sambhaavna dikh rahi he

 The union leader of workers on indefinite strike from March 27, Harish says that we had given notice in the hospital 15 days in advance that all the employees would be on a day off on Friday, March 17

 Because AIIMS is a hospital where people from all over the country come for treatment and in such a situation, thousands of patients will be troubled by the strike

 Tamil Nadu Chief Minister j Jayalalithaa has made it clear that she will not attend the meeting of Chief Ministers in Delhi on the issue of internal security
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko likhe khat main unhone saaf kar diya he ki vah is baithak main isliye hissaa nahin lengi kyonki itani ahm baithak main mukhyamantriyon ko bolne kaa paryaapt avasar nahin diya jaataa he
 They are not even given time to talk
 is khat main jayalalita ne likhaa he ki is baithak main vah apana pratinidhi bhejengi jo unka bhaashan padhegaa
 Let me tell you that in a similar meeting last December, she was shown a red light after speaking for more than 10 minutes, after which she came out of the meeting angry
 rashtriya vikaas parishad kii is baithak main bhi desh ke tamaam rajyon ke mukhyamantri hissaa le rahe the
 In his letter, Jayalalithaa has mentioned that she was forced to end her speech by being 'dishonest'
 tippaniyan Jayalalithaa alleged that leaders from states are prevented from giving their support in such a meeting
 isse prathit hota he ki baithak main rajyon ke mukhyamantri ke rabar stamp kii bhaanti hi hote hai jinhen purvanirdhaarit baton par sahmati deni hoti he
 Jayalalithaa said that 12 important issues will be discussed in this meeting too, which will take 10 minutes to name only
 or yahi samay rajyon kii siem ko diya gaya he jo naakaafi he
 In this letter, Jayalalithaa has written that in this meeting she will send her representative who will read her speech
 bataa den ki pichley disambar main isi prakaar kii ek baithak main unhen 10 minute se zyada bolne par laal batti dikhaa di gai thi jiske baad vah naaraaz hokar baithak se baahar aa gai thim

 The comments jayalalita ne aarope lagaaya ki rajyon se aae netaaon ko is prakaar kii baithak main apana sahyog dene se roka jaataa he
 It appears that the meeting is like the rubber stamp of the Chief Minister of the states, who have to agree on predetermined things
 jayalalita ne bataaya ki is baithak main bhi 12 ahm muddon par charchaa honi jo jinka maatr naam lene main hi 10 minute kaa samay chalaa jayega
 And this time has been given to the CM of the states which is insufficient
