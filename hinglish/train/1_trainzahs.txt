 The central government has added a new chapter in the history of Jammu and Kashmir
 jammu-kashmir ab ek centre shasit pradesh he or pichley sattar saal se jis anuchhed 370 ke tahat ghati ko visheshadhikaar mili the, use bhi beasar kar diya gaya he
 In the midst of all these decisions, security forces are still deployed in the valley, people have many questions in their mind
 is bich pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kashmir ke logon ko sandesh dene ke liye raashtra ko sambodhit kiya or apana vijan kashmiri logon or duniya ke saamne rakhaa
 This vision of PM Modi has a 3D formula, which can be seen in Kashmir in the next few days
 artical 370 ke khatm hone ke baad piem kaa ye pehla samvaad tha, jisamen unhone is faisle ke bare main desh ko vistrut jaankaree di or apane plan ko aage rakhaa
 During this time, the Prime Minister talked about the two-d formula, which includes development and democracy
 lekin ek or di yani ajit dobhaal is vakt kashmir main hai, jo modi ke mishan kashmir kaa ahm hissaa hai
 In the first forty-minute speech of d-democracy, the Prime Minister's focus was on democracy
 darasal, ghati ko abhi centre shasit pradesh banaaya gaya he, aise main kai raajnneetik dalon ne is par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 But PM Modi has given confidence to the Kashmiris that he will choose his own representative
 centre shasit pradesh hone ke baavjood jammu-kashmir kaa apana mukhyamantri hoga, mantri honge or vidhayak bhi honge
 It has also been promised by Modi that when the right time comes, Jammu and Kashmir will be made a full state
 isi ke saath pradhanmantri ne ghati ke yuvaaon ko netritv karne ke liye kaha or apil kii ki kai dashakon se yahaan parivaarwaad rahaa he, aise main ve khud aakar pradesh kaa netritv karen
 Read: The strategy by which other states win, Modi is following the same strategy in Jammu and Kashmir
 The second focus of the Prime Minister was on the development of the valley
 unhone kai baar nai nitiyon kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki artical 370 kii vajah se jammu-kashmir main kai kendriya yojana lagu nahin ho paati thim
 Apart from this, corruption was at a peak in the valley
 lekin ab kyonki centre sarkaar kaa shashan vahaan rahegaa, isaki vajah se ghati ke vikaas ko nai oonchai milegi
 During this time, PM Modi also appealed to the people of Bollywood and industry to invest in Jammu and Kashmir
 saath hi saath unhone rajya karmchaariyon ko centre shasit karmchaaree vaali sabhi suvidhaayen, sports kii duniya main nae aayam, scolership or anya yojanaon kaa laabh jald se jald pahunchane kaa vaada kiya
 Third D: Doval is the most important environment in Jammu and Kashmir at this time
 ghati main is faisle ke baad kisi tarah kaa virodh naa ho, koi dikkat naa aae or aatanki apane mansoobey main kaamyaab naa hon iske liye centre sarkaar suraksha par khaasaa dhyaan de rahi he
 National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval himself is also in Kashmir for the last three days
 ajit dobhaal vahaan par adhikariyon se mulaakaat kar rahe hai or is badlaav ke samay main puri vyavastha kaa jayja le rahe hai
 At the same time, he is also talking with the common people, so that the people living in the valley can be given confidence in this decision of the central government
 unhone shopiyaan main aam logon ke saath khaanaa khaaya, srinagar ke mashhoor downtaun ilaake main bhi logon se baat kii
 NSA Doval holds cabinet rank in the Modi government
 suraksha ke masalon par pradhanmantri narendra modi ajit dobhaal par bharosa karte hai, aise main unki maujuudagi vahaan par myne rakhti he

 Madhu Kishwar said that this was an unprecedented event in the academic history of Indian universities, which raised a lot of questions simultaneously

 congress ke rashtriya mahasachiv or madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh in dinon apano se khush nahin hai
 This is the reason why he is not hesitant to call himself a drowning sun and obstinacy
 madhya pradesh kii congress kii raajnneeti main digvijay singh sabase taqatvar netaaon main se ek hai
 In the last two decades, what has been desired in Congress politics in the state has happened
 aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav se pehle halaat main kuch badlaav aayaa he, congress ne kendriya rajyamantri jyotiraditya sindhiya ko chunaav prachaar abhiyaan samiti kaa adhyaksh banaakar aghoshit taur par nayaa cheharaa saamne laayaa he
 While the party has pushed Scindia ahead, Jugalbandi of Scindia and Union Urban Development Minister Kamal Nath have made Digvijay Singh quite weak in the state
 yah najar bhi aa rahaa he
 This is the reason that he has had to sit in the back row in four rallies of Congress National Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 ise kuch log ranneeti kaa hissaa bhi maanate hai
 Digvijay Singh also expressed his displeasure in his own style in the presence of Rahul Gandhi in the Gwalior meeting
 unhone kaha, 'duubate hue suraj ko koun puujata he, ugta suraj jo manch par he, use ham sab pranaam karte hai
 'not only this, he had also accepted in Indore that he is the setting sun
 gwalior kii sabha main digvijay ne jahaan khud ko duubataa suraj bataaya tha, vahiin kaha tha ki ve sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ke saamne manch par kabhi nahin bolte hai, magar bal hath ke aage unhen bolnaa pad rahaa he
 On Thursday, Twitter has raised new questions, describing the persistence as harmful
 digvijay ne apane twit main bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar narendra modi kaa naam liye bina shobhan sarkaar par unki tippanee or phir palati khaane par hamalaa bolaa he
 In this tweet, Digvijay has attacked Modi on the one hand and on the other hand, has described hatha as harmful
 digvijay singh ke twit par ek najar
 
 
 'badbole' ji got stuck, saying it was a joke, religion also became public, hearing it was speechless

 But without experience, who has got success? Anybody who is stubborn, is bad, thinking wisely, Baal, Tria and Raj stubbornly do harm
 karti he nuksaan, sadaa kehete hai gyani
 Senior journalist Shiv Anurag Pateriya of Madhya Pradesh says that Digvijay Singh is a shrewd politician
 unke bayaan va twit ranneeti va naaraazgi jaahir karne kaa hissaa ho sakate hai
 At the same time, he also gives a message to the party that the youth will have to carry forward with experience

 - The cartersa post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST The Supreme Court, while hearing the Muzaffarpur shelter home case, expressed dissatisfaction over the status report of the case
 court ne bihar sarkaar is maamle kii jaanch ke liye or vakt dene se saaf inkaar kar diya
 And handed over the investigation to all the cases related to the shelter home
 isse pehle desh kii sabase badi adaalat ne bihar ke mukhya sachiv deepak kumaar ko fatkaar lagaai
 Only Deepak Kumar appeared in the court after taking the status report of Muzaffarpur Shelter Home Case
 sarkaar ke vakil ne adaalat se guhaar lagaate hue kaha ki agar shelter home se jude sabhi 17 maamalon kii jaanch sibiai karegi to sarkaar ko lekar galat massej jayega
 But the court handed over all the cases to the CBI, calling the state police a failure
 saath hi farmaan sunaaya ki is jaanch se jude kisi bhi adhikari kaa transfar nahin kiya jayega
 An audit report was sent to the Social Welfare Department of Bihar on behalf of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences regarding the entire matter at Muzaffarpur Shelter Home

 In this case, 50 live cartridges were recovered from Manju's husband's house during a police raid
 jab chandrashekhar ke khilaaf arms act kaa mukadmaa darj kiya gaya tha
 After this, warrants were also issued against Manju
 lekin manju faraar chal rahi thi
 The Supreme Court expressed resentment and summoned the Chief of Bihar Police
 iske saath hi 20 november ko manju ne naatakeey dhang se court main jaakar sarender kar diya
 Surprisingly, the police did not even know about it

 According to the court, the Hindu Marriage Act allows only Hindu couples to get married

 Roman Catholic Raj married Pavani on October 24, 1996 in Hindu temples at the temple

 katha samraat munshi premchand kaa janmdiwas unke gaanv lamahi main manaaya gaya
 While government departments paid the duty, private schools, painters, litterateurs and journalists also remembered the narrator for a day
 ab puure saal unhen sabhi unke haal par chhod denge
 Despite all the announcements, Munshi Premchand's house and village are still a victim of neglect and whatever has been built, he just stands there, without any work
 munshi ji kii jayanti par unke paatr hori, madhav, ghisu kii gahari samvednaa se jude kalakaar naatak ke jariye unhen yaad kar rahe the
 His birthday is celebrated every year at Lamahi
 sarkari mahakme kii taraf se farz adaayagi ke liye tent bhi lagaataa he, smarak sthal par kaarykram bhi hote hai or gaanv main meley jaisaa maahaul bhi rahata he, lekin kathakaar ke liye ek din ke pyaar par gaanv waalon ke bheetar ek dard bhi he
 Suresh Chandra Dubey says that the pain is that once a year takes the form of a festival, but after that, no one is aware of who Premchand is, where he is
 logon ko lagata he ki premchand ke gaanv chal rahe ho, vahaan bahut kuch hoga, lekin yahaan aane par maayoos ho jate hai
 It seems that Premchand was the writer of the common man, but he remained common, but could not be special
 lamahi gaanv main, munshi premchand ke jis ghar ke angan main kabhi ghisu, hira, gobar, dhaniya paidaa hokar javaan hue the, jayanti ke din us ghar kii darodivar par rang-rogan kiya gaya he
 Paintings of his characters hang on the walls, and people are also coming to see, but this house remains in ruins throughout the year
 aisa bhi nahin he ki sarkaron ne munshi ji ke naam par kuch nahin kiya
 Many schemes were made, with the efforts of previous governments, a research institute was built in front of Munshi's house at a cost of about two crores
 building or duusare sansaadhan bhi muhaiyaa kara die gaye, or ise BHU ke hindi vibhaag kii dekharekh main saunp diya gaya, lekin beete chaar saal se yah badahaali kii dhul phank rahaa he
 There is chaos everywhere in Lamhi
 lamahi ke dwaar par baithe munshi premuchandra ke paatr bhi salbhar kii upeksha se kam niraash nahin
 Older Kaki, who is neglected by the family, is also looking for a moment's love in his eyes and he is seeking this love from those who are the real bearers of Munshi's literature tradition, but only one day in the year to come
 hindi vibhaag ke professor sadanand shahi kehete hai ki apane lekhak se pyaar karne kii or apane lekhak ko sanjoye rakhane kii, uski smritiyon ko jeevant banaae rakhane kii jo saamaajik jimmedaari he, use hamen puraa karnaa chahie, jo ham nahin kar paa rahe hai
 The irony is that four days before Munshi Premchand's birth anniversary, the electricity in his house was cut off because the bill had not been paid for 14 years
 jab yah khabar media main ai, to aanan-fanan bijli vaise hi judwa di gai
 Because no department was taking responsibility for this
 gauratlab he ki pehle yah makaan or premachand ji kaa smarak nagari prachaarini sabha ke paas the, lekin phir unhone ise nagar nigam ko de diya, nagar nigam ne bhi baad main varanasi vikaas praadhikaran ko dekar pallaa jhaad liya or ab jab yah vivaad saamne aayaa he, to jiladhikari ne ise samskruti vibhaag ko saunp diya or ab is gaanv ko god lekar khud ise desh ke bade falak par laane kii yojana bana rahe hai
 The assailant, Wade Michael Page, fired at a gurdwara in Wisconsin's US, had tattoos on his body that contained secret racial codes and symbols that clearly indicated his white frenzied views
 pej (41) ne beete ravivaar ko ok creek gurudware main golibari kar chah logon kii hatya kar di thi
 The attacker himself was killed in retaliation by a security force
 ‘anti-difemeshan lig’ :adiel: kii sah-nideshak merlin myo ne bataaya ki pej kii baanh par kai tatu bane hue the or inamen kuch nasleey code or pratik chhipe hue the, jo uske shwet unmaadi vichaaron kaa prakatikaran kar rahe the
 The ADL works to collect details in cases related to racism in the US
 merlin ne kaha, ‘pratik is sabhyataa (unmaadi) kaa mahatvapurn hissaa he
 It shows that you are part of a race based campaign

 ek sher he- ‘dushmani jamkar karo par itani gunjaaish rahe ki jab kabhi dosti ho to sharmindagi naa ho
 'but the enmity between BJP and JDU, which has been together for years, has become so deep that in politics, both parties are now breaking the Lakshman Rekha of embarrassment in degrading each other
 mukhyamantrijithanram maanjhike report card ke jabaab main jab bijepi ne report card jari kiya to us report card par chapa cartoon donon dalon main dushmani kii nai lakshmana rekha khinch gaya
 Nitish's cartoon holding the leg of RJD chief Lalu Yadav has warmed up the politics of Bihar
 cartoon puure bihar main charchaa kaa vishay bana hua he or yah sidhe-sidhe nitish kumaar ko chidhaane ke liye kaaphi he
 Perhaps this is what BJP wants
 lekin bijepi yaheen tak nahin rukne vaali, vah to baqayda is cartoon ko ab har shahar-gaanv, chowk-chauraahon or gali-mohallon par taangane kii taiyaari main juty hui he
 BJP state president Mangal Pandey says, 'we have put the truth in front of the people through cartoons, now if the public wants, then from tomorrow it will hang it at the square
 darasal parde ke peeche kii kahani ye he ki purv mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa pradhanmantri narendra modi par hamalavar andaaj jari he
 In his Sampark Yatra, Nitish Kumar is attacking Modi by listening to audio cds and audio of 'mann ki Baat' of Modi's election speech on black money
 yahi nahin nitish bijepi ko uske naam ke bajaae ‘canaphoonkwa party’ ke naam se bula rahe hai or nitish kaa yaheen andaaj bijepi ko chubh rahaa he
 In response to this, BJP has also directly targeted Nitish and that too by keeping political limits on hold
 baharhaal bijepi ke is cartoon ko vipaksh jahaan nichle darje kii siyasat bataane main juta he, vahiin bijepi ise apana tranfacard maan rahi he
 The party will now not only hang up these posters in response to Nitish, but will also narrate excerpts from Lalu Yadav's speech in which Lalu had asked Nitish to fall on his feet in the assembly by-elections so that he could connect his cartoons with the truth
 saaf he aise main bhale hi raajnneeti kaa str gire par donon dal ek-duusare ko nicha dikhaane kaa koi mauka nahin chodenge
 Pakistan has been buoyed since the Indian Air Force's air strike and is not deterring its nefarious antics
 buudhvaar subah pakistan ne ye phir siddh kar diya ki agar bharat apni aatmaraksha ke liye aatankwaadiyon kaa safaya karegaa to pakistan un aatankwaadiyon ko bachaane ke liye bhartiya faujee or maasoom nagarikon ko nishaanaa banayega
 The central government has been active since Pakistan's dastardly act
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne bada bayaan dete hue kaha ki agar america osama ko maar saktaa he to bharat bhi masood ajahar ko pakistan main hi maar giraane kii kshamta rakhata he
 After such a big statement, it is necessary to know how the US had eliminated Osama's terror in 2011 and whether India will be able to take such action against Masood? So let us know today that the biggest operation in history The story and understand the strength of India - a suicide terror attack on America on 11 September 2001
 itihaas main ye sabase bade aatanki hamalon main se ek he
 In this attack, 2996 people were killed and a large number of people were injured
 is hamale kii jimmedaari alqaida ke aakaa osama bin laden ne lee thi
 After such a big terrorist attack, America was completely shaken and the spirit of revenge started to burn inside it
 tab shuru hua america kii khufia agenciyon kaa sabase bada oparation
 Osama bin Laden escaped after the 2001 attacks
 pehle wo afghanistan gaya, phir vahaan se tora bora kii pahadiyon main apana thikaana bana liya
 For 9 years, Osama kept dusting the eyes of American agencies in this manner
 wo pakistan ke kisi gaanv main chhipakar apni aatankwaadi gatividhiyon ko anjaam detaa rahaa
 But in 2010, Osama's most trusted messenger, through the US agency, through which he successfully completed his mission
 bataa den, kaaphi lambey samay tak kuch pakistani log america kii central intelligence agency ke liye kaam kar rahe the
 Those same people had seen that messenger from Osama in a white Suzuki car in Peshawar in July 2010
 ye jaankaree milte hi america agency ection main aa gai or unhone kaaphi lambey samay tak us vyakti kii gatividhiyon par najar rakhi
 While chasing that messenger, the agencies arrived in Abbottabad where Osama bin Laden was confirmed to be hiding
 ab yahaan se shuru hua opareshnt napatun spir or america ke navy sil ke commando nikal pade osama ke khatme ke liye
 How this operation took place america ke 79 helicopter afghanistan ke jalalabad ilaake se nikal pade
 2
 raat ke ek baje pahunche navy sil ke commando abtabad
 There, one of his helicopters descended quickly as expected and its rear part hit a wall
 lekin is ghatana main koi jakhmi nahin hua or oparation ranneeti ke mutabik aage badha
 3
 tabhi un commando par guestaouse ke peeche ke daravaaje se golibari shuru ho gai
 It was revealed that the bullet was fired by Osama's messenger Abu Ahmed Kuveti
 commando ne turant hi use maar giraaya
 Abu's wife was also killed in the incident
 4
 They then blow up the main gate of the commando guesthouse and travel to the first floor
 vahaan pahunchate hi ve sandeshvahak ke bhai ko bhi maar gira dete hai
 5
 oparation aage badhata he or osama kaa betaa khalid bhi maaraa jaataa he
 As his son tries to attack the Navy seals, the commandos kill him
 6
 Now the operation reaches its final stage and travels to kill Osama
 sil navy ke commando jaise hi teesri manzil par pahunchate hai, unhen osama apane haath main eke-47 lekar khadaa dikhataa he
 At the same time, the seal navy immediately kills the terrorists
 bataa den, osama kii baayen aankh or chaati par goliyon se waar kiya gaya or usne turant hi dam tod diya
 7
 iske baad osama kii tasviir bhi khinchi gai or america adhikariyon ko bhej di gai
 Within 12 hours Osama bin Laden's body was stabbed
 bataa den uski body ko uttari arabian samudr main phek diya gaya
 So in this way America completed its 9 / 11 revenge and Al Qaeda's command Osama bin Laden was killed
 ab vitt mantri arun jetali ke bayaan ke baad ye ummid to jag gai he ki bharat bhi kuch isi tareeke kii karrwai kar saktaa he
 However, the intelligence agency of India is very active and has the ability to work in this manner
 bataa den, bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan ( ISRO) bhi pakistan ke 87 fisadi kshetrafal par apni paini najar banaakar rakhti he or hamaari agenciyon ko HD quality kii tasviren bhejti rahati he
 Not only this, our air force has shown its might
 unhone siddh kar diya ki ve kam samay main sateek nishaanaa laga sakate hai
 Let me tell you, the Mirage 2000 which was used by the Indian Air Force in air strikes, is a very powerful aircraft
 miraj ek baar main 13,800 kilo barood ke saath 2000 prati ghante kii raftaar se ud saktaa he
 However, in 2015, these aircraft have also been upgraded
 iske alaava bhartiya vayusena ke paas mig 21, mig 27 or jaguaar jaise dhasu aircraft hai
 India is also continuously strengthening its radar system
 vayusena ke alaava bhartiya army or nausena bahut shashakt he or kisi bhi prakaar kaa hamalaa karne ke liye hameshaa taiyaar he
 At this time Pakistan's fury means that it knows that its military power cannot stand in front of India
 to matlab saaf he, bharat ke paas takanic bhi he or sainya bal bhi
 Now if strong will is shown by the government, then India can also eliminate Jaish's ruling Masood Azhar

 dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne nirbhaya ko yaad karte hue desh ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ko patr likhakar centre sarkaar or dilli sarkaar ke bich ho rahi khinchataan ko darkinar karte hue mahila suraksha par ek saath milakar kaam karne kii apil kii he
 Ever since Swati Maliwal took charge of the Women's Commission, she has been demanding to form a high level committee consisting of representatives of the Central Government, Delhi Government, Women's Commission and Delhi Police
 haalanki abhi tak aisi koi kamity nahin ban pai he lekin swati ne ek baar phir nirbhaya gangrape kii ghatana ko yaad karte hue mahilaon kii suraksha ko pukhta karne liye pradhanmantri se maang kii he ki wo jald se jald ek aisi cameti banaaen jo mahilaon kii suraksha sunishchit kar saken
 Respected Prime Minister, i am writing this letter to you with great hope and hope
 16 disambar 2012 ko dilli main nirbhaya balaatkaar kii dardanaak ghatana ke chaar saal biit jane ke baad aaj bhi dilli main mahilaayein evam bacchiyaan surakshit nahin hai
 Today, even after four years, there is no significant change in the situation at the ground level
 aaj bhi dilli main teen-teen saal kii bacchiyon ke saath balaatkaar ho rahe hai or mahilaon ke prati aparaadh badhata ja rahaa he
 On November 21 last month, a 4-year-old girl was raped and murdered
 uske agle din hi ek 3 saal kii bacchee ke saath rape karke uski hatya karne kii koshish kii gai
 a few weeks earlier, an 11-month-old girl was raped for 2 hours
 aaj har din dilli main 6 ladkiyaan nirbhaya ban rahi hai
 Delhi has become known as the Rape Capital in the world
 sar, dilli police se mahila aparaadh par mili aparaadh ke aankaden bataate hai ki varsh 2012 se 2014 main mahilayon ke khilaaf aparaadh main 31446 FIR darj hui or sirf 146 logon ko sajaa mili
 This clearly shows that there is no fear in the minds of criminals in Delhi that if they do wrong then the system will not spare them
 yanha tak kii nirbhaya ko bhi abhi tak nyaay nahin mila he
 Recently when Nirbhaya's mother met me, she said angrily to me that sometimes she feels that her daughter is dead, otherwise she would have died of suffocation due to lack of justice
 yah is desh ke liye bahut sharmnaak baat he
 His grief is the grief of every fearless and his family in the country
 sar mujhe lagata he ki agar mahilayon ke khilaaf aparaadh karne vaale apradhi ko har haal main or jald sajaa milane lage to sudhaar jarur hoga
 For this, there is a need to increase the accountability of the police at the war level and also the resources of the police
 iske alaava forencik lab or corts bhi badhaane kii jarurat he
 All this will be possible only when the Central and Delhi governments work together
 abhi centre va dilli sarkaar kii aapasi khichataan kaa khamiyaja dilli kii mahilayon va bacchiyon ko bhugatna pad rahaa he
 At present, there is no such effective committee on women safety in Delhi which can compel the central and state government to work together and take decisions in the interest of women
 agar aisi koi cameti hoti to mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki dilli main mahilaon ke khilaaf hone vaale aparaadh main kami aati or police kii javabdehi badhanaa, police record kaa digital karnaa, thana level cameti bananaa, street lite lagavane, toilet banavaane, victim kampanseshan skim lagu karnaa, deh vyapaar rokna, dilli mencisitivi camerelgavane jaise kaam gati se ho pate
 To resolve this complicated situation, the Delhi Commission for Women has been urging the Central Government for the last one and a half years to set up a High Level Committee for coordination between the Center and the State on the safety of women in Delhi, in which the Honorable Union Home Minister , Hon'ble Deputy Governor, Hon'ble Chief Minister of Delhi, Delhi Police Commissioner and Delhi Women's Commission be included
 taaki centre va dilli sarkaar har maheene ek manch par aakar dilli kii mahilaon kii suraksha ko sunishchit karne ke liye thos nirnay le saken
 It is just now that in Delhi, in the last one year, the Honorable Deputy Governor has not called a meeting on women's safety even after the Central Home Ministry has said
 nirbhaya balaatkaar kii ghatana ke baad dilli main mahilaon kii suraksha ko durust karne ke liye kendriya grih mantralay ne ek special task force kaa gathan kiya tha jisamen grih sachiv kii aguwai main grih mantralay ke adhikari, dilli sarkaar ke adhikari, dilli police ke alaava dilli mahila ayog ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya tha
 The purpose of this committee was to establish coordination between the Central and Delhi Government on women's safety
 lekin is saal july ke maheene main is special task force ko bhi yah kahkar band kar diya ki mahila suraksha ke jis uddeshy ke liye yah cameti banaai gai thi vah puraa ho gaya
 This is very unfortunate
 nirbhaya balaatkaar kii ghatana ke baad bane nirbhaya fund ke 3 hajaar karod rupye bhi ab tak kharch nahin hue hai
 The Delhi government had sought Nirbhaya fund from the Center in July 2015 for installation of CCTV in DTC buses but till date they have not received this fund
 sar hamane pehle bhi patr likh kar nirbhaya fund sucharu rup se istemaal ke liye suzav die the ki nirbhaya fund kaa istemaal desh ke police steshnon, skool, college or bason main sisitivi lagavane ke liye kiya jaaen
 Nirbhaya funds can be used to build forensic labs and one stop centers, for rehabilitation of human trafficking and acid attack victims, and also for the welfare of women and children living in Nari Niketan
 dilli mahila ayog kaa maananaa he ki nirbhaya fund kaa istemaal sucharu rup se tabhi ho saktaa he jab is fund ko rajyon ke bich baant diya jaae or dilli main centre va rajya kii hai level cameti is par nirnay le
 i also want to draw your attention to the Delhi Commission for Women
 pichley ek saal main dilli mahila ayog ne 12 hajaar cese dekhe hai
 3
 16 lakh colls 181 helpline par atend kii gai hai
 Our team has helped 7500 women by visiting their homes
 55 sifarish centre va rajya sarkaar ko bhi mahila ayog ne di hai
 You will be very happy to know that Delhi Women's Commission is the first women's commission in the country which also works on Saturdays
 par aaj dilli mahila ayog par har taraf se akraman kiya ja rahaa he
 The brothels are running on GB Road, located three kilometers from the country's Parliament, where every day small and innocent girls are being trampled
 har ladki ko 30-30 logon ke saath sona padataa he
 When the Delhi Women's Commission took the initiative to end this human trafficking business, two false firs were lodged against us
 ham is ore kaam na karen or isliye aise jhuthe cese darj kara die gaye
 Not only this, efforts are being made to end the autonomy of Delhi Women's Commission
 yahaan kaam karne vaale staff kii teen maheene se selary roak di gai he
 Acid attack victims, orphan girls and other victims also work in women's commission, their salaries have also been stopped
 aaj unke ghar main pai-pai kii killat ho rahi he
 Delhi Women's Commission's Rap Crisis Cell, 181 Women Helpline, Mobile Helpline etc
 programs are on the verge of closure
 aaj dilli main rape to nahin ruk rahe balki dilli mahila ayog ko band karne kii najayas koshish kii ja rahi he
 Sir, this daughter of Delhi is bringing the words of the women of Delhi with a lot of hope through this letter to you
 main aapse guzarish karti hum ki is patr par sangyaan lete hue turant dilli main mahila suraksha par hai level cameti kaa gathan karwaae
 i request you to also give me an appointment so that i can brief you in detail the problems faced in ensuring the safety of women in Delhi
 teen talaak ko lekar desh main is vakt bahes chhidi he
 The All India Muslim Personal Law Board and the government are face to face with this
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne is puure maamle par sarkaar kaa paksh saamne rakhte hue ek blog likhaa he
 According to Jaitley, both the triple talaq and the Common Civil Code are separate issues
 koi bhi personal lau samvidhan ke mutabik hi hona chahie
 Constitutional validity of triple talaq Algeetli said, 'the constitutional validity of the triple talaq and the Uniform Code of Conduct are completely different
 sarkaar kaa najariya saaf he
 Personal law should be according to the constitution
 teen talaak ko bhi samanta ke adhikaar or sammaan ke saath jeene ke paimaane par hi parkhaa janaa chahie
 It is needless to say that the second personal lawper also applies the same scale
 'piem ne kaha- mahilaon ko mili samaan adhikarisase pehle pradhanmantri ne bhi kaha tha ki sabhi dharmon kii mahilaon ko samaan adhikaar milanaa chahie
 After that Venkaiah Naidu and other ministers had also cleared their positions with three divorces and Muslim Personal Law Board
 ab jetali bhi isi mudde ko saaf karne main lage hai ki teen talaak or muslim personal lau donon alag hote hai
 Whereas, the Muslim Personal Law Board is saying that it is a religious issue
 isamen sarkaar ko hastkshep nahin karnaa chahie

 Balakrishna is the Magadi assembly seat of Ramnagara district - Ramesh Bandi is Sridrangpattavidhan Sabha seat of Siddagoda Mandya district - Bhima Naik is Hazaribommanahalli assembly seat in Ballari district parampara yaa ravaayat kya he? kaayade se dekhie to ye mahaz ek practice he
 Which one started
 kisi or ne uski nakal kii or phir wo ravaayat ban gai
 Regardless of what is right and what is wrong
 logic lagane kii gunjaaish jisamen nahin hoti use hiparamparasamajh lijie
 Just as it is not necessary that every tradition is wrong
 usee tarah ye bhi zaruri nahin he ki har parampara sahi ho
 Many such traditions exist throughout the country, under whose feet humanity is being trampled under
 wo kehete hai kigayaunke upar se guzar jaati he or unhen pataa bhi nahin chalata he
 He says that every vow is fulfilled here
 kabhi khaali nahin jaati
 This practice has been going on for centuries
 unke bachche bhi ise chalaayenge
 Many people are superstitious but we have reverence
 iske baad sari bahes ko yaheen khatm kar dijie
 Because in the case of faith and reverence, questions are not asked
 varanaa aapako adharmee kah diya jayega
 It is obvious that faith and religion are kept in our eyes
 magar soch ke dekhie sadak par aapke bagal se guzarati gaay thodaa sa sir bhi hilaa de
 So because of fear, your confidence changes in a moment
 siharandaudjati he badan main
 Then why not here
 to sari jaddojahad kaa nichod ye he ki aapke jism ke upar se paanv rakhkar agar gaay guzar jaae
 So understand that your years old loan has been paid off
 shaadi yaa baccha nahin ho rahaa he to ho jayega
 If you do not have a job, it will be done
 kul milakar mannath kisi bhi ho yahaan puri ho jaaegi
 People here believe that this eliminates all problems
 sari mannate puri ho jaati hai
 Now look at this tradition from the eyes of those who believe in it, then their argument is that when there can be a paradise under the feet of the mother who gives birth
 to phir jis gau mata ke sharir main 33 karod devi devataaon kaa vaas ho to kya wo mannath ko puraa nahin kar sakati
 Faith is possible
 isiilie shuru main hi aapse saaf kah diya gaya tha ki aasthaa or shraddha ke maamle main sawaal nahin karte
 Now let us understand what this tradition is
 darasal madhya pradesh keujjainzile main ek gaanv he bheedavad
 According to tradition, Govardhan Puja is held here on the second day of Diwali
 khaas is maukey par yahaan ek parampara prachlit he
 According to this tradition, in this village with a population of four thousand, eight people are selected who want to make a vow
 ye chunaav mannath ke meyar ke mutabik kiya jaataa he
 a procession of these selected people is taken out in the morning after the worship
 or phir gaanv main bich chauraahey par unhen lita diya jaataa he
 After this, the process of the rich cows of the village passing through them begins
 is parampara ke mutabik mata bhavani ke mandir main mannath maangane waalo ko 5 din pehle hi ghar chhod kar mata ke darbar main aana hota he
 After staying in the temple with reverence for 5 days, they are prepared for the blessings of Maa Gauri or cows and are laid on the ground
 haalanki gaay ke pairon se sir main chot na lage isliye in logon ke sir ko kambal se dhak diya jaataa he
 Now you have to decide whether to call it faith or superstition, but for those who believe it, it is very close to the heart
 shaayad isi vajah se ye parampara yahaan barason se chali aa rahi he
 The villagers say that no one has been hurt by this tradition till now and will not be any further
 shaayad inke isi yakeen ne is parampara ko vakt ke saath kamjor nahin padane diya
 The faith of the people still remains on this murderous practice
 inke mutabik gaay mata kaa agar ek pair bhi in par pad gaya to inaki sari manokamanaayen puri ho jaaengi
 And the blessings of Gauri Mata will always be there

 unhone bhi apni ejineering kii padhai bich main hi chhod di thi
 Sushant was pursuing mechanical engineering from Delhi Technological University
 unhone bataaya ki unhen college ke pehle semester ke baad baahar kar diya gaya tha

 world tii-20 ke shuruaati mukaable main team india ko badi haar mili he
 This means that now all three matches will have to be won in order to reach the semi-finals, and winning alone is not going to work
 badi jeet darj kerani hogi, tabhi semifinal main jane kii guarantee milegi
 Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni says that a big defeat against the Kiwi team may have to bear the brunt, as now it is not just to win but also to win by a big margin only then the hope of going to the next round will be tied
 dhoni ne kaha ki haal hi main ek tii-20 vishwa cap aisa bhi rahaa tha jisamen team india mahaz ek match haarane ke baad toornament se baahar ho gai thi
 
 captain jis vishwa cap kaa zikr kar rahe hai wo 2012 main srilanka main khelaa gaya tha
 
 
 Team India had lost just one defeat to Australia there
 
 Apart from this, India had won against Afghanistan, England, Pakistan and South Africa in the remaining 4 matches of the GUP stage, but despite that Team India was eliminated from the tournament
 dhoni ke jahan main yah ghaav abhi bhi taaja hai or is baar to group or bhi mushkil he
 Top teams like Australia, Bangladesh team reaching the Asia Cup final and Pakistani team who can beat any team at any time
 kiwi team ke khilaaf haar ke baad pakistan ke khilaaf mukaable main team india par dabaav hona lajimi he, lekin captain is par kuch or raay rakhte hai
 The comments dhoni ne kaha ki ham to aisa kuch nahin kah rahe na soch rahe hai
 As far as the pressure of winning is concerned, it will remain in every match, because from here to now there is a do or die situation, in which all the matches are necessary for Team India to win
 matlab saaf he, 'karo yaa maro' yahaan se har match nokout match kii tarah khelnaa hoga
 If you lose, the dream of becoming a world winner will be broken and if you win, hope will be tied
 team india ke captain mahendra singh dhoni kehete hai ki kiwi team ke khilaaf badi haar kaa team ko khamiyaja bhugatna pad saktaa he, kyonki ab sirf jeet se hi nahin balki bade antar se jeet darj kerani hogi tabhi jaakar agle daur main pahunchane kii ummid bandhegi
 Dhoni said that recently there was a T20 World Cup in which Team India was eliminated from the tournament after losing just one match
 
 The World Cup which the captain is referring to was played in Sri Lanka in 2012

 uske alaava gp stage ke baaki 4 maichon main bharat ne afghanistan, england, pakistan or dakshin africa ke khilaaf jeet darj kii thi lekin uske baavjood team india toornament se baahar ho gai thi This wound is still fresh in Dhoni's mind and this time the group is even more difficult
 australia jaisi top team, asia cap final main pahunchane vaali bangladesh team or pakistani team jo kabhi bhi kisi bhi team ko haraa sakati he
 There is bound to be pressure on Team India in the match against Pakistan after the defeat against the Kiwi team, but the captain has some more opinions on it
 tippaniyan Dhoni said that we are not saying or thinking anything like that
 jahaan tak baat jeet ke dabaav kii he to vah to har match main rahegaa, kyonki yahaan se ab karo yaa maro kii sthiti he, jisamen sabhi match team india ke liye jeetna zaruri he
 The meaning is clear, 'do or die' from here every match has to be played as a knockout match

 The Mumbai Police has arrested a maid, who was continuously blackmailing her boss over recordings of sex
 maid ne ghar ke maalik se kaha ki maine ham donon ke sex kii recording kar lee he
 Instead of keeping it a secret, she constantly demanded money
 piesu ke dijiem ne naukaraani ke saath kisi bhi tarah ke sambandh se inkaar kiya or kaha ki vah ab tak use rakam vivaad ko nazarandaaj karne ke liye de rahe tha, lekin jab usne duusari baar blackmel karke ek lakh rupee kii maang rakhi, to vah police ke paas gaye

 Police said Med threatened the family that she would most likely say in the housing society that she had been physically abused
 badanaami ke dar se parivaar ne us samay maid ko teen lakh rupee die
 Recently she again demanded a lakh rupees from the family and said that if not found, she would file a rape case against the officer and his son
 police ab is baat kii bhi jaanch kar rahi he ki naukaraani ne or kahaan is tarah kii kahani se logon ko blackmel kiya he
 This time the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi will be the guest of PM Modi on Republic Day Parade
 bharat kii ore se shaikh mohammad bin jaayad al nahyaan ko is kaarykram ke liye nyotaa bheje jane or unki taraf se ise kubul kiye jane kii badi siyaasi ahmiyat he
 On the one hand, PM Modi is trying to help Western countries to strengthen on the strategic front, while in the areas of economy, defense, they are working to strengthen the relationship with the UAE to increase India's reach
 piem modine crown prince ko nyotaa dekar ek tir se do nishane saadhe hai
 Though it is seen as a 'return' of PM Modi's visit to Abu Dhabi and Dubai last year, but at a time when there is tension between India and Pakistan, a big message from the announcement of the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi's visit to India has gone
 saudi arab kii tarah sanyukt arab emirate yani yuai bhi pakistan ke puraane samrik sahyogi rahe hai
 The UAE, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan were the only three countries that recognized Taliban rule in Afghanistan
 lekin us vakt se ab tak kaaphi vakt guzar gaya he
 The relationship between the UAE and Saudi Arabia has changed significantly
 ye donon mulk security or counter-terarysm ke masale par bharat ke kaaphi kareeb aae hai
 By inviting the Prince of Abu Dhabi on the occasion of Republic Day, PM Modi has played a new bet in his strategy for the 'middle East'
 crown prince kaa yuai kii security or bhu-rajnatik niti nirdhaaran main acha khaasaa prabhaav he
 He has also been the Supreme Commander of the armed forces of the UAE
 abu dhabi main bhartiya samudaay kii acchhee khaasi aabaadi he
 Therefore, the interest of the Government of India for a better relationship with that country is natural
 piem modi jab se satta main aae hai, unke videsh dauron main madhya purv pramukhataa se chaaya rahaa
 Modi has also been interested in building military relations with the UAE
 donon deshatankwaad se jangaur security ke masale par ek-duusare ko harsambhav sahyog karenge
 PM Modi traveled to Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Iran and other neighboring countries during his two-year tenure
 isse saaf he ki arab jagat ko lekar bharat kaa najariya badal rahaa he
 Last year, when PM Modi visited the UAE, a joint declaration with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan reflected a major diplomatic victory for India
 yah ek bada badlaav tha kyonki 34 saal baad bharat kaa koi piem yuai gaya tha
 Given the current era of economic reforms in India, it could become an attractive and safe investment destination for the UAE
 saath hi bharat chahta he ki vah yuai ke saath milakar vigyaan or takanic ke kshetra main kaam kare
 On the first Republic Day after Modi became PM, US President Barack Obama and next year French President François Hollande became official guests of the Government of India

 This is the same committee in which Rajan once presented the much-discussed document in which he projected the financial crisis in the world market in 2007-08
 us samay rajan antarrashtriya mudra kosh ke mukhya arthshaastri the
 Rajan has been under constant pressure from the government and industry to further cut the policy rate
 china ke mudde par rajan ne kaha, bharat bada vyapaarik bhagidaar rahaa he, lekin phir bhi china kii arthvyavastha main susti kaa asar itnaa zyada nahin hoga jitna ki anya deshon kaa hoga
 Raghuram Rajan warned the US Federal Reserve Bank to hike interest rates at a time when the global economy is in turmoil
 unhone kaha, ‘meraa maananaa he ki jab duniya main uthal-puthal he, aap aisa mat kiijie
 
 is bare main lambey samay se anumaan jataayaa ja rahaa he, yah kabhi-na-kabhi hona he, har koi yah jaanata he lekin is sambandh main samay ke hisaab se kadam uthaaya jaae
 ' alag se bloomberg tivi ke saath baatcheet main rajan ne kaha ki kendriya bank nai maudrik niti samiti par sarkaar ke saath samjhaute par pahunch gaya he
 He said the committee would differ from the proposed draft in which the government was to appoint a majority of members
 haalanki, unhone is bare main vistaar se kuch nahin bataaya
 The comments ullekhneey he ki sarkaar ke masauda prastaav main die gaye suzav ko lekar vivaad khadaa ho gaya tha
 Under this, the government would appoint majority members in a committee headed by the Governor of the Reserve Bank
 saath hi chairman ke paas vito shakti dene ke purv prastaav ko bhi waapas lene par jor diya gaya tha
 However, Rajan later said that he had no problem with the idea of removing the veto power
 philhal rigerv bank governor ke paas takneekee paraamarsh samiti he jo maudrik niti par paraamarsh detii he, lekin unke paas samiti kii baton ko sweekaar karne yaa use khaarij karne kaa adhikaar he
 The Reserve Bank Governor also said that there is an atmosphere of optimism in India's economy and China will be one of the least affected countries
 jaikson hole shikhar baithak ke dauraan sienbisi ke saath baatcheet main rajan ne kaha, ‘hamane yah nahin kaha he ki (nitigat dar main katautee par) hamaara kaam puraa ho gaya
 We will take further decisions based on the data
 ’ rajan ne kaha, ‘hamaari arthvyavastha main mudrasphiti he jo ki anya arthvyavasthaaon main nahin he
 We have cut the rate three times so far this year and we are still in the stage of adjusting
 hamaari aane vaale aankadon par najar rahegi or usee ke anuroop aage faisla karenge
 Rajan also said that an agreement has been reached with the government of the Reserve Bank on the issue of setting up a monetary policy committee to fix the rate
 isaki jald ghoshnaa kii jaaegi
 Rajan has come here to attend the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium of the Kansas City Federal Reserve
 yah vahi samiti he jisamen rajan ne ek baar bahucharchit dastavej pesh kiya tha jisamen unhone 2007-08 main vishwa bazaar main vittiya sankat kaa anumaan vyakt kiya tha

 On the issue of China, Rajan said, India has been a big business partner, but still the sluggishness in China's economy will not be as much as that of other countries
 raghuram rajan ne america fedral rigerv bank ko byaaj daron main aise samay vruddhi ko lekar aagaah kiya jab vaishvik arthvyavastha main uthal-puthal chal rahi he
 He said, 'I believe that when there is turmoil in the world, do not do this
 
 It has been speculated for a long time, it has to happen sometime, everyone knows this but in this regard, action should be taken in time

 Operation 15 August
 ye kahani he us saazish kii jo jab beparda hui to dusron ko darshan dene vaale sant asaram baapu ko khud jail darshan karnaa padaa
 On the afternoon of August 15, what happened in seclusion, 40 km away from Jodhpur
 is 15 agast kii taiyaari ke liye asaram baapu or unke chaar chelon ne kab, kaise, or kya-kya saazish rachi? asaram baapu kabase us ladki ke peeche pade the
 You will find answers to all these questions in this story
 ye puri kahani rajasthan ke adishnal edwocket general anand purohit ke jodhpur zila evam satr nyaayalay main die gaye bayaan par aadhaarit he
 Babasaal was the beginning of 2013 for many months
 asaram baapu chah saal baad chhindwara aa rahe the
 Baba has a Gurukul in Chhindwara
 jisamen kareeb aath sau ladkiyaan padhati hai
 In this Gurukul, around 70 girls were preparing to give the examination of the twelfth
 jabaki kareeb-kareeb itani hi ladkiyaan gyarahavin se barahavin main pahunchane vaali thim
 She was one of the same girls going from Gyarav to 12th standard
 wo, jisapar baba kai maheenon se nazaren gadaaye the
 In fact, Baba first saw the girl in Uttarakhand in 2012
 use dekhte hi baba kii niyat kharaab ho gai
 Later it was found out that the girl studies in Baba's Chhindwara Gurukul
 chhindwara pahunchane se pehle hi baba ne apni khaas sevadaar shilpi ko gurukul kaa warden bana kar chhindwara bhej diya
 And with that began the story of the lust-filled plot whose climax came out on Independence Day i
e
 15 August
 chhindwara gurukul se shuru hui kahanebaba ke aadesh par chhindwara gurukul pahunchate hi shilpi ne ladki ko bahakaana shuru kar diya
 She started trying to prepare him to go to Baba somehow
 koshish jari thi
 But the girl was not ready
 darasal uttarakhand main baba se pehali mulaakaat ke dauraan hi ladki asaram kii niyat bhaanp chuki thi
 But he did not tell this thing to anyone then
 ladki kaa bhai bhi chhindwara gurukul main hi pard rahaa tha
 He felt that telling the family would spoil the education of both siblings
 vakt bitta rahaa
 Shilpi continued to celebrate the girl
 par baat nahin bani
 The efforts released from January were also failing by July
 ab agast kaa maheenaa aa chukaa tha
 Baba's patience was breaking
 ab or intjaar mushkil tha
 The pressure on the artisan was continuously increasing
 badhate dabaav ne shilpi ko ek doosraa chaal chalane par majaboor kar diya
 He now started convincing the girl that she was possessed by ghosts
 wo use bataane lagi ki kaise uskaa man kisi kaam main nahin lagata
 Why does she stay in the bathroom for two-and-a-half hours? In the name of removing the shadow of the ghost, the girl called Jodhpur, slowly throwing a real trap in the mind of the girl by putting the ghost in her mind
 usne ladki se kaha ki agar wo ek baar khud ko baba ko samarpit kar degi to saare dukh sari beemaari dur ho jaaegi
 But the girl aware of Baba's intention was still not ready
 tab shilpi ne aakhri daanv khelaa
 He contacted the girl's parents in Shahjahanpur
 unhen bataaya ki shilpi par bhootpret kaa saaya he
 Once shown to Baba, it can be cured
 shilpi kii baat sun kar ladki ke pita to taiyaar nahin hue alabatta maa jarur maan gai
 Shilpi also told the girl's parents that both of them can go with Baba for treatment
 ye sun kar ghar vaale raji ho gaye
 After the housemates agreed, now the girl was also ready to be forced to get treatment from Baba
 shilpi ne ye khabar fouran phone par asaram ko di
 Asaram's phone always picks up his personal Sevadara Shiva
 vahi phone baba ke kaan par lagaataa he
 Preparations started to send the girl to Baba as soon as the news was received
 shiva ko jimmedaari di gai ki wo jodhpur main baba kaa pravachan rakhwae
 So that the girl could be called to Jodhpur during the same discourse
 shilpi kii jimmedaari thi ladki ko chhindwara se jodhpur tak laane kii
 And Sharat Chand was given the task of arranging for Shilpi and the girl to be sent to Jodhpur
 iske baad shiva ne 9, 10 or 11 agast ko jodhpur main baba ke pravachan kii taarikh tay kar di
 As soon as the date of the talk was fixed, news was given to the girl's family
 sajeesh main asaram kii ashleel companyye sab kuch paanch agast ke aasapaas hua
 After this, from August 5 to August 15, Asaram, Shiva, Shilpi and Sharat Chand were having about thirty phone conversations every day
 paanch agast se pehle yaa pandrah agast ke baad in chaaron ne kabhi itani baar baat nahin kii
 As soon as all the preparations were completed, Asaram reached Jodhpur
 teen din kaa pravachan unhone puraa kiya
 Then on August 13, he reached Deora farm house in Madai village, 40 km from Jodhpur
 jise wo ekantavaas kii kutiyaa bulaate hai
 Meanwhile, the girl's parents had also come to Jodhpur
 unhen tab jodhpur me hi baba ke paal ashram main rakhaa gaya tha
 Meanwhile, on 13 August, the girl, with Shilpi, reaches Jodhpur from Chhindwara
 railway stesan par khud asaram kaa nijee sevadara shiva donon ko risive karne aata he
 The girl spends the night of August 13 at the Pal Ashram with her parents
 iske baad 14 agast kii subah shiva ladki or uske maa-baap ko lekar asaram ke ekantavaas vaali kutiyaa yani farm house pahunchataa he
 In the farm house, Baba's personal cook Prakash cooks for the girl
 use doodh detaa he
 Then in the evening for the first time Baba comes in front of the girl
 maa-baap saath main the
 There were other people too
 baba unhen pravachan sunaate hai
 Bless you phir tay hota he ki asaram 15 agast ko ladki kaa ilaaj karenge
 On 15 August, the girl is seen in front of Baba in the afternoon
 maa-baap tab bhi ladki ke saath the
 Sometime Baba talks to the girl's parents
 phir hukum sunaate hai ki ladki kaa ilaaj wo akele kamare main karenge
 Because solitude is necessary for treatment
 baba kaa aadesh sunate hi ladki ke maa-baap us kamare se kuch dur kar die jate hai
 Shiva had already left the girl with Baba
 kamare ke kareeb ab bas baba kaa rasoiyaa prakaash tha
 The girl goes inside the room and the door closes
 ashleel harakat kaa virodh karne par asaram ne di dhamkiasaram baapu maheenon se jis ladki ke peeche pade the ab wo jodhpur se 40 kilometre dur unke saath unke ekantavaas main thi
 The room was closed and Baba's chef Prakash was present outside the room
 jabaki kutiyaa main hi kuch duuri par the ladki ke maa baap
 Shiva and Shilpi had left the girl to Baba
 ab band kamare main bas asaram or ladki thi
 Baba first hypnotized the girl and then started fulfilling months old lust
 par shaayad baba ke sammohan kaa puraa asar ladki par nahin hua tha
 So she started opposing Baba's obscene act
 tab baba ne use dhamkee di
 The threat is that if he opens the tongue, then his left and parents studying in Chhindwara Gurukul will be killed
 dhamkee se dar kar ladki khamosh ho gai
 Then after one and half hour the door of the closed room opened
 ladki chupchaap maa-baap ke saath ekant kutiyaa se baahar ai or shaam ko jodhpur pahunchi phir usee shaam shahjahanpur ke liye nikal gai
 Udha Baba also came out of seclusion on the morning of 16 and left for Delhi via Jodhpur
 jahaan 19 agast se unka pravachan tha
 Meanwhile, after reaching Shahjahanpur, the girl got courage and told her mother everything
 maa ne baap ko bataai or phir puraa parivaar 19 ko dilli pahunch gaya
 To meet Baba and ask Baba
 par baba ne milane se manaa kar diya
 So on 20 August, the girl wrote a report against Baba at the Kamla Market police station in Delhi
 or is tarah oparation 15 agast sabake saamne aa gaya

 i suggested setting a rate for a normal rate and another for demerit goods (products that are not considered good intake)
 mujhe lagata he ki bharat main ek rate karne par bahes nahin honi chahie, balki yah bahes is par honi chahie ki ham kyon nahin teen slab rakh sakate hai
 There are currently four tax slabs under GST
 isamen ek 5 fisadi, doosraa 12%, teesraa 18 fisadi or chauthaa 28 fisadi he
 Luxury and demerit goods such as tobacco and gutkha attract the highest tax rates
 iske alaava in par ses bhi lagaaya jaataa he
 Explain that Congress President Rahul Gandhi had raised the demand for keeping only one tax slab under GST
 haalanki vitt mantri arun jetali se lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi tak ne is suzav ko sire se khaarij kiya tha
 He said that this is not possible
 subramanyan ne bhi inaki baat ko doharaate hue kaha kijistiek pratigaami kar niti he
 Therefore, it would not be fair to keep the same rate
 ek rate tab hi sambhav ho saktaa he, jab garibon ke sangrakshan ke liye pukhta intjaam kiye jaaen
 The father of a 6-year-old girl who was a victim of rape in Bopal area of ahmedabad last week is addicted to alcohol
 is bacchee kii maa ko ye dar he ki bacchee ke liye mili sarkaar or swayamsevi sanghathanon se mili aarthik sahaayta kii raashi bhi bacchee kaa pita kahin sharaab main na uda de
 The reason is also, on Tuesday, this girl's father came to meet her at the hospital where she is undergoing treatment
 vahaan uski patni se jhadap bhi hui or hospital ke karmchaariyon ne mahila kaa saath diya jisamen wo ghayal bhi ho gaya
 He was also admitted to a ward of the Civil Hospital
 yahaan se wo guuruuvaar kii subah bhaag gaya tha
 The girl's mother said that her husband keeps doing such acts for alcohol
 pehle bhi bacchee ke ilaaj ke liye kuch paise mili the lekin unka kya hua iske bare main bhi koi jaankaree nahin he
 Now the girl's father has come to the fore, he also admits that he drinks alcohol but his medicine is that he did not ask for money from the girl's money
 wo apni mazaduri se hi sharaab pite hai
 At present, the hospital has increased security so that this girl does not have any more trouble
 phir bhi parivaar kii vyathaa ye he ki jahaan ladki or puraa parivaar itane bade haadase se guzar rahe hon to bacchee ko madad karne kii bajaay pita agar sharaab main duba rahe to kya hoga? Let me tell you that a security guard tortured the innocent badly
 bacchee ke maa-baap vahiin majdoor kaa kaam karte hai or vahiin is security guard kaa jhagada hua tha
 To avenge that, he did this abominable act with this girl
 is ladki kii madad ke liye swayamsevi sanghathan or sarkaar aage aae the
 Financial support was provided to his family
 bharat main shivasena kii ore se lagaataar ho rahe pakistan ke virodh se naaraaz hokar somvaar ko PAK kii punjab assembly main ninda prastaav pesh kiya gaya he
 Describing the Shiv Sena as an extremist organization, the resolution urged the United Nations to declare it a terrorist organization and ban it
 yah prastaav pakistan pipuls party (PPP) ke faija malik ne pesh kiya
 The resolution clearly states that the House is opposed to the Shiv Sena's fundamentalist activities and sees the Shiv Sena as a threat
 is par bain laganaa chahie
 Let me tell you that Shiv Sena workers entered the BCCI headquarters on Monday and surrounded the president and also opposed the meeting with the President of Pakistan Cricket Board, due to which the meeting was adjourned
 iske pehle shivasainikon ne mumbai main hi pakistan ke purv videsh mantri kasuri kii pustak ke vimochan se pehle bhi virodh kiya tha or kaarykram ke aayojak sudhindra kulkarni ko pakistan kaa agent bataate hue unke munh par kaalikh pot di thi
 Not only this, Shiv Sena had also warned about the concert of Pakistani singer Ghulam Ali in Mumbai while opposing Pakistan
 jiske baad ise radd kar diya gaya
 Expressing strong objection to the members of the Anna Hazare team being called 'anti-nationals', the BJP has said that such attacks against those who criticize the wrongdoings of the government are conduct against democracy
 bhaajapa adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘main samajhataa hum ki kisi ko raashtra-virdohi kahana sarvatha anuchit he
 There may be divisions among the people of the country, but calling those who agitate against the government as anti-national is not justified anywhere

 Video: piem modi or imran khan ke bich nahin hui baatcheet- sutara The controversy over UPA chief Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Vadraras is hot and Arvind Kejriwal is ready to strike another hammer
 wadra or dlef donon apni taraf se bol chuke, lekin kejariwal ko santusht nahin kar sake hai
 Kejriwal has said that the cleanliness of DLF is airborne and today it will be blown away
 kejariwal kii kasuti par koi bhi jawaab khara nahin utarataa
 This is the reason that today they will speak again and if they speak, they will open the pole
 khamosh kyon he gandhi parivaar?robert wadra or dlef ke rishton ko lekar kejariwal ne jo aarope lagaae hai
 dlf's reply to that seems to Kejriwal as a bundle of lies
 yahi vajah he ki kejariwal ne kaha he ve aaj is mudde par vistaar se bolenge
 Kejriwal's accusation against Vadra is that he is not answering the questions that have been asked
 wadra ne hamaare sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin diya: kejarivalwadra ne kaha he ki kejariwal or prashanth bhushan sasti lokapriyata ke liye unhen or unke parivaar ko badnaam kar rahe hai
 Kejriwal says that Vadra has questioned his motive
 un sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin diya he, jo unase puche gaye the
 Kejriwal has said that he has read dlf's reply
 company ne kai jaankariyaan chipa lee hai, jisapar vistaar se jawaab diya jayega
 Kejriwal also wants to know what Vadra has to say on the cleanliness of DLF
 ve dlef se puri tarah se sahamat hai, yaa phir kuch or kahana chahenge
 Charges for cheap popularity: Vadraarvind Kejriwal had alleged that why DLF gave 65 crore interest free loan to Vadra's company? DLF replied that no interest-free loan has been given to Vadra or any of his companies

 australia ke khilaaf siries main team india kaa koi bhi khilaadi maidan par aakraamak andaaj apnaane main peeche nahin rahaa he
 This kind of noises on the field among players is not new, but the question is who is benefiting from it
 sawaal yah bhi he ki kya aakraamak cricket khelnaa kaa yahi ek tarika he, kyonki philhal to team india ke is andaaj se use nuksaan or australia ko phayda hota najar aa rahaa he
 Former captain Sunil Gavaskar was one of the most aggressive players of his time, but he also does not support this attitude of India
 gavaskar kaa kahana he, ham jab cricket khelnaa shuru karte hai, to ham sledging nahin karte, jabaki australia bachapan se ye karte hai, isliye agar aap unhen maidan par kuch kehete hai, to unhen fark nahin padataa
 If you say something to the other player on the field and then your performance is not good, you are under pressure
 philhal to team kaa ye andaaj australia ko phayda pahunchaa rahaa he
 Australia have won both Test matches of the series, but so far no bad or excessively aggressive behavior has been seen from their players
 shaayad unke saathi phil huge kii maut ne puure australian cricket ko badal kar rakh diya he
 It is not that no aggressive cricket was played by Team India before these players
 sachin tendulkar, rahul dravid, anil kumble or virendra sahvaag ne apane puure kariyar main virdohi tiimon kaa har maukey par jawaab diya, lekin ve apane munh se zyada apane khel se baaten karnaa pasand karte the or yahi sabase behtareen tarika bhi he
 Surprisingly, no one can convince these players about their game and their behavior
 team ke captain is vakt team se ukhde-ukhde najar aate hai or tabhi shaayad vah dressing room main 'unrest' kii baaten kehete hai
 Everyone knows that Virat Kohli is the future of India, but the sad part is that players are adopting more than their performance on the field
 dilli main varsh 2013 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main 13 siten aisi thim, jahaan jeet or haar kaa faisla 2,000 se bhi kam voton se hua tha
 In five of these seats, the margin of victory was less than 1,000 votes, and the most interesting fact is that in three of these seats the difference was less than 500
 is baar bhi in sabhi siton par muqabla kaante kaa he
 Last time the lowest margin of victory was in RK Puram seat, where the Aam Aadmi Party could not win by just 326 votes and the bet was won by BJP, and winner Anil Sharma is also in the fray this time
 dilli kaint seat par bhi aam aadmi party ke surendra singh ne bijepi ke karan singh tanvar ko sirf 355 voton se shikast di thi, lekin bijepi ne unka tikat nahin kaata he
 In Vikaspuri, Krishna Gehlot of BJP lost by just 405 votes and Mahendra Yadav of Aam Aadmi Party won the seat in his name
 itane kam antar se haarane ke baavjood bijepi ne is baar krishna gahalot par daanv nahin khelaa he
 The last time the Sangam Vihar seat also went to the account of the Aam Aadmi Party and the margin of victory here was only 777 votes, but the BJP has not cut SCL Gupta's ticket
 iske alaava sadar bazaar seat par aam aadmi party ke somadatt ne bijepi ke jaiprakash ko 796 voton se haraaya tha, jinka tikat party ne kaat diya he
 Girish Soni, who was an AAP MLA from Madipur and BJP candidate Kailash Sankla, had 1,103 votes, and Sankla lost the party
 sultanpur maajaraa seat congress ke khate main gai thi, or jaykishan ne aam aadmi party ke sandip kumaar ko 1,112 voton se shikast di thi, lekin sandip is baar bhi res main hai
 Jungpura, Karol Bagh, Rajendra Nagar, Rohini, Mustafabad and Gokulpur are also among such interesting victories and losing seats, with the difference being 1,744, 1,750, 1,796, 1,872, 1,896 and 1,922 votes respectively
 jangpura main vijeta rahe 'aap' ke emes dheer is baar bijepi ke tikat par maidan main hai
 In Karol Bagh, BJP has cut the ticket of loser Surendra Pal Ratwal
 rajendra nagar seat par bijepi ke arapy singh jite the, or party ne is baar bhi unheen ko maidan main utaara he
 The Rohini seat went to the AAP account last time, and the ticket of the lost BJP candidate Jayabhagwan Agarwal has been cut, but the most interesting aspect is that the last time more than 28,000 votes were cast against Arvind Kejriwal from the New Delhi seat
 The party has played a bet in Rohini on former state president Vijendra Gupta, who lost to third
 mustafabad seat pichley chunaav main congress ke hasan ahamed ne bijepi ke jagadish pradhan ko haraaya tha, lekin is baar bhi yahi donon maidan main hai
 The Gokulpur seat went to the BJP account last time, so this time also candidate Ranjit Singh remains intact
 ek or dilachasp jaankaree yah he ki pichhali baar in 13 siton main se nau par aam aadmi party or bijepi ke bich sidhi takkar thi, jinamein se saat par 'aap' ko kamyaabi mili thi
 In two seats, the AAP was competing with the Congress, and both had one seat each
 baaki bachi do siton par muqabla bijepi or congress ke bich tha, or yahaan bhi ek-ek seat donon partiyon ne apane-apane naam kii thim
 Asin, who made her Bollywood debut by working in films like 'ghajini' and 'ready', says that she now wants to do some good roles
 asin ne bollywood main chah filmon main kaam kiya he jinamein se paanch filmein ‘100 karod club’ main pahunchi
 However, the character of the actors was important in these films
 asin kaa kahana he, ‘maine ek faisla liya he
 i will move a little slower this year
 box aphis par safalataa, 100 karod kii kamai, yah sab ho chukaa he
 'asin told,' i should now move forward and do roles that have opportunities to perform
 mujhe lagata he ki aisa faisla lene ke liye yah sahi samay he
 'asin started his film journey from Ghajini with Aamir Khan
 iske baad unhone salmaan khan ke saath ‘landan drims’ or akshay kumaar ke saath ‘khilaadi 786’ main bhi kaam kiya
 Asin, who started her acting career with South Indian films, said, 'I don't want to play only female-centric roles
 main yah bhi nahin chaahati ki puri film kii kahani mere ird gird hi ghume
 i have established myself
 ab mujhe apane bheetar ke kalakaar ko santusht karnaa he
 Asin has recently come to America with long skirts
 is sambandh main khabare aayin thim ki asin ne shaadi kar lee he
 However, Asin denied these reports

 isiilie nahin ki yah world cap kaa final he, balki isiilie kyonki donon timen shandaar form main hai or donon team kii captaini bhi shandaar rahi he
 Brandon mccullum and Michael Clarke have proved this, winning the match no matter the circumstances
 newzealand ko haraana australia ke liye aasaan nahin hoga
 People of India will be seen saying hello to New Zealand for two reasons, i mean cheering New Zealand
 pehali vajah yah he ki newzealand ko pehali baar final main pahunchane kaa mauka mila he or iskaa phayda uthaate hue newzealand world cap jite
 The second reason is that cricketing lovers are upset with the Australian players' sledging
 pichley kuch dinon main australian khilaadiyon ne sledging ko apana ek hathiyaar maan liya he
 It seems that three things matter for Australian players during the match, batting, bowling and sledging
 pakistan ke purv captain rameez raja kehete hai, 'australia kii yah yojana hoti he ki maidan ke andar tu-tu-main-main karenge or match jeet jane ke baad bear kaa gilaas haath main lekar vipakshi team ke dressing room main haath milaane pahunch jaaenge
 It seems to have come to sprinkle salt on the wound
 agar australia ke nazariye dekha jaae to gharelu maidan par khilne ke vajah se australia ko phayda jarur milegaa
 The biggest problem for New Zealand would be to perform in front of Australia's domestic audience which has psychological pressure
 lekin form kii baat kii jaae to newzealand australia se acchhee form main he
 New Zealand have also defeated Australia during the league match but it is also true that New Zealand played this match in their home ground Auckland
 2015 ke world cap main newzealand ne ek bhi match australia ke maidan par nahin khelaa he
 But India's viewers will be seen standing alongside New Zealand on the Melbourne ground
 is match main bhi duusare maichon kii tarah toss kaaphi myne rakhega
 Whichever team wins the toss will bat first because there have been four matches in the 2015 World Cup on this ground so far and the team batting first has won the match every time and the team batting first in each match has scored more than 300 runs
 Have also made
 agar aankadon ke nazariye se dekha jaae to australia aage he
 During this World Cup, Australia played their first match on Melbourne ground and scored 342 runs while batting first and also beat England by 111 runs
 2009 ke baad newzealand ne koi bhi match melbern ke maidan par nahin khelaa he
 New Zealand played their last match at this ground on 6 February 2009 and defeated Australia by 6 wickets
 melbern ke maidan par australia ne kul 118 ekadivasiy match khele hai or 71 maichon main australia ko jeet mili he or jeet kaa pratishat 62 ke kareeb rahaa he
 On the other hand, if we talk about New Zealand, New Zealand has won only 8 out of 24 odis and the win percentage is close to 35
 bharat is world cap se baahar ho chukaa he
 Now the people of India will watch this match without any pressure
 ab koi drama nahin hoga, drum nahin bajegaa, news channel par bharat ke khilaadiyon kii khinchaai bhi nahin hogi
 Now that will be what it should be
 jo jitegaa vahi sikandar

 The process of desolation and settlement has just started
 ' agar aap samaaj ke har mudde par likhi gai buraai par chot karne vaali kahaniyaan aisi bhades prishthbhumi ke saath padhanaa chaahate hai to pushpapal singh dwaara sampadit 'navaagat peedi 21 veen sadi kii kahaniyaan' padhein
 Almost all the stories published in this book were written keeping in mind the circumstances and circumstances of his time
 in kahaniyon ke madhyam se aap bazaarwaad, jatvaad, sampradayikta or udaarikaran ke saamaajik prabhaav ko samaj sakate hai
 The compilation of stories takes care of the stylus, not taking care of the big name
 isamen kai aise lekhakon kii kahani shaamil he, jinase hindi kaa pathak varg zyada parichit nahin he
 a total of 19 stories have been compiled in this book
 kitaab kii pehali kahani he 'nyaay- katha', jise ajay navariyaa ne likhaa he, vah saamaajik vyavastha ke jatigat dhaanche par chot karti he
 The protagonist of this story, Ravidas who is a Dalit, says in the court 'we are worthy, clean and acceptable till our identity is revealed
 is kahani ke madhyam se navariyaa ne dalit ke us dard ko likhaa he jo aadhuniktaa ke labaade ke saamne praaia: chup jaataa he
 At the same time, 'bandhua Democracy', the story of Omprakash Valmiki, the thinker and writer of Dalit literature, brings out the shortcomings of this system in which Dalits have got paper rights but they are still socially backward
 is kitaab kii lagbhag sari kahaniyaan vartmaan vyavstha ke saath praasangik bani hui he kyonki in kahaniyon main maujuud dard or pidaa ko abhi bhi bhartiya janata mahasoos kar rahi he
 The language and narrative craft of these stories is very different from the stories of the twentieth century

 In Umashankar Chaudhary's story 'little Story of Lalmuniya Makhi', the author has pointed to the situation of the general public of the country by making the fly a victim of globalization and marketism

 Arif's 'tar' and Sasibhushan Dwivedi's 'shirthless' seem very relevant
 donon lekhakon ne bade hi sookshm dhang se raajnneetik gatirodh ko apni kahaniyon main jagah diya he
 Why Read: The biggest feature of most of the stories in this book is that they are not woven into the sky of fantasies, but the reality that is occurring in society is written
 aap aisi kahani padhakar samaaj main ghatit ho rahe yaa ghatit hue halaaton ke bare main waakif hote hai
 Although the subject of the story of this book is serious, you can also enjoy a lot by the words and the way of writing
 kyon na padhein:agar aap kii dilchaspee samaaj, desh main ghatit ho rahi chizon main nahin he to yah kitaab aapke liye nahin he

 pashchim bengal bijepi ke liye itnaa jaruri kyon ho gaya he
 The reason behind this is said to be the changed air of Uttar Pradesh
 andarkhaane bijepi ko ehsaas ho chalaa he ki 2014 kaa 71 siton kaa itihaas doharaana kaaphi chunauteepurn he
 In such a situation, only one province remains to compensate
 pashchim bengal
 This is the reason why PM Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah are not ready to sit silent even after only 9 seats are left in the last phase
 jayanagar, damdam, barasaat, bashirhaat, diamond harbar, mathurapur, kolkata dakshin, kolkata uttar, jadhavpur
 These nine seats have become a dream for the BJP
 2014 main bhi bijepi ne inpar takat jhonki thi
 However, Amit Shah was not a strategist then
 modi ke jaadu main bhi ye sari siten mamata ne jeetin
 This is the reason for the bjp's worry and rage that what will happen this time
 kyonki in siton kaa itihaas bijepi ke liye bahut utsahjanak nahin he
 Except two of these nine, BJP did not get second number on any seat
 damdam se tiemasi ke saugat raay jite to duusare number par sipiem ke aseem dasgupta the
 tmc's Kakoli Ghosh won in Barasat, followed by aifb's Murtaza Hussain
 basirahaat se tiemasi ke hi idris ali jite the to duusare number par sipiai ke nurul hoda the
 Similarly, tmc's statue Mandal won from Jayanagar while Subhash Naskar of RSP was second
 mathurapur se mohan jatua jite to duusare number par sipiem ke rinku naskar the
 tmc's Abhishek Banerjee won from Diamond Harbor while Abul Hasnat was second
 jadavapur se tiemasi ke sugat bose jite the to duusare number par sipiem ke sujan chakravarti the
 BJP was number two on two seats
 yah siten he kolkata dakshin or kolkata uttar
 Subrata Bakshi of TMC won from Kolkata South while Tathagata Roy of BJP was second
 kolkata uttar se tiemasi ke sandip bandopadhyaay jite the to duusare number par bijepi ke rahul sinha the
 In most of the seats, the gap between TMC and BJP has been more than 25 percent
 sabase kam faasla 11 fisadi vot kaa tha
 Meaning the challenge is huge
 mamata banerjee kisi bhi surat main apane kile ko bikharane nahin dena chaahatin
 And in any case, Modi wants to break into Mamta's fort
 is baar bengal main kuch bhi pehle jaisaa nahin he
 Neither politics, issues nor voters
 is baar jang murtiyon ke bich
 On one side is the statue of Mamta Banerjee and on the other side is the statue of Narendra Modi
 23 may ke nattejey in murtiyon kii oonchai ko bhi sthapit karenge

 ’ Can a person control nature? Perhaps your answer will be no, but North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un's propaganda team is claiming it
 is team kaa kahana he ki mausam kaa mizaaj uske commander kim jong un kii mutthi main he
 Kim Jong is naturally terrified of them
 taanashaah ko dekhakar barfbaari par brake lag jaataa he, uski saanson kaa suraj gulam ho gaya he
 Of course you are laughed at hearing these claims, but the North Korean media, trying to make dictator Kim Jong god them, is now talking about similar things
 taanashaah ko dekhte tham jaati he barfbaari?uttar korea ko kim un jong ne parmaanu desh kya ghoshit kiya, uski takatein insaani hadon ko paar kar gayi
 Now nature has also started to salute that dictator's slavery
 use dekhte hi barfbaari tham jaati he or barfili aandhiyon par brake lag jaataa he
 We are not saying this
 ye daawa kar rahaa he kim kii gulaami karne vaali uttar korian media
 North Korean media said - Kudrat was happy to see Kim
 North Korean state media KCNR wrote that the weather patterns suddenly changed
 pahaado ne kim un jong kaa dil se swaagat kiya or kudarat ko control karne vaale commander ko dekhakar khushi jaahir kii
 Gaddaad is the dictator of North Korea after successful testing of nuclear missiles reaching the US recently
 chaati chaudee kar duniya par hansaa taanashaahwah apni khushi jaahir karne ke liye uttar korea ke us sabase oonche pahaad par pahunchaa, jise behad pavitra mana jaataa he
 Upon reaching the top of Mount Pektoo, Kim looked a little surprised and smiled
 usne chaati chaudee kii or duniya par thahaake lagaakar hansaa
 The dictator Kim was probably trying to give the message that the world should not mistake him for being stupid and cynical
 mount pektu par tainaat he uttar korea kii foujpektu chotii par taanashaah kii muskaraahat cheekh-cheekh kar ye kah rahi thim ki uski faujee nitiyaan or uski fouj main duniya ko nestnabud karne kii takat he
 Not that Kim arrived on Mount Pektu for the first time
 wo aksar yahaan jaataa he
 Actually, Pektu is considered the birthplace of the first dictator of the Kim dynasty
 lihaaja jab bhi uttar korian taanashaah apni takat kaa pradarshan karata he or phir pektu kaa shukriya adaa karne pahunchataa he
 The North Korean government has deployed troops on Mount Pektu
 sainiyon kaa hausala afjai karne pahunchaa he kimamount pektu par kim jong un ke dada kim il sung kii murti bhi maujuud he
 Whenever Kim comes here, the soldiers posted here are encouraged
 saath hi kim il sung ko shradhanjali detaa he
 When Kim arrived on Mount Pektu, the troops stationed here celebrated
 vardi kii chunautiyon se jujhate gulam faujee apane saare gamon ko bhuulakar use dekhte hi taaliyaan bajaane lagate hai, lekin is baar to had ho gai
 North Korean media also claimed to celebrate nature
 barf se dhakaa rahata he mount pektumount pektu kii oonchai kareeb 9,022 feet he or disbanr ke maheene main ye pahaad barf se dhakaa rahata he, lekin uttar korea kii sarkari media kii maane to kim ke yahaan pahunchate hi barfbaari tham gai or dhoop nikal ai
 The mood of the season keeps changing
 mumkin he ki kim ko mausam vaigyanikon ne usee din mount pektu par jane kii salaah di ho, jis din dhoop nikalne kaa anumaan rahaa ho, lekin kim kii propaganda team ne ise uski takat se jod diya

 55 dinon tak chalane vaale is mahaparv ke pehle din makar sankranti ke din sangam tat par shraddhaluon kaa sailaab umad padaa he
 People are taking a holy dip in Sangam
 mahanirvaani akhaade ne kiya pehla shahi snanasbase pehle shahi snaan mahanirvaani akhaade ne kiya
 When this arena reached the Sangam beach, there was a crowd of Naga sadhus everywhere
 mahanirvaani akhaade ke saath atal akhaada bhi thi
 Julus of the Mahanirvani Arena was also worth visiting
 akhaade ke mahamandaleshwar rath par savaar the
 There were strong security arrangements during the procession
 shuru hua akhaadon kaa shahi snanamahanirvaani akhaade ke baad niranjani akhaade kii shahi sawari nikali
 Along with this arena, there were also saints of Anand Akhara
 june akhaade, aavahan or agni akhaade ke sadhu-sant bhi shahi snaan ke liye nikal rahe hai
 a total of 13 akharas will take royal bath today shahi snaan shaam saadhe paanch baje tak chalegaa
 All the necessary arrangements have been made for this
 sangam main duubaki lagane se pehle hi tadake se hi sadhu sanyasiyon ne puja paath or havan shuru kar diya tha
 Since morning, people were so desperate for the pilgrim's drowning that they landed at the confluence before 4 in the morning
 thand ko maat dete hue logon ne pavitra dubkee lagaai
 The joy of this holy bath was so much that even older women were seen singing and dancing
 jaise jaise din chadhane laga, sangam tat shraddhaluon se pat gaya
 People took a dip in the confluence on the auspicious occasion of Makar Sankranti
 logon kaa sailaab snaan ke liye lagaataar pahunch rahaa he
 Today it is estimated that one crore people take bath
 sangam tat par utsav kaa maahaul he or logon main gajab kaa utsaah he
 The festive atmosphere on the Sangam coast was sometimes marred by the royal ride of Raje princely states at Kumbh
 ab raaje rajavaade nahin rahe lekin shahi sawari kii shaan aaj bhi barkaraar he
 The akhada enters the Kumbh region with great pride
 kisi bhi kumbh main shahi sawari kii ye shaan dekhne ke liye umad padati he logon kii bheed or phir elahabaad ke mahakumbh kii to baat hi niraali he

 Peshwai entered the Kumbh region with great pride
 12 saalon ke intjaar ke baad ai is ghadi ke swaagat ke liye koi kami nahin rakhi gai
 The chariot of Lord Rama and the Acharya of the Akhada behind him were at the forefront of the elephant, horse and camel ride
 vaishnav akhaade kii peshwai main sadhu santon kaa parakram dikhaa
 Armed with weapons and a variety of tricks, the monk was seen
 is parakram ke khel main sandesh chipa tha ki keval vairaag nahin balki parakram main bhi bhartiya sant kisi se peeche nahin hai
 Strong security arrangements: There are strong security arrangements on the Sangam coast on the Sankranti

 That is why they are using eco friendly items to make their huts or tents so that Ganga is not polluted due to them
 madhyapradesh main kisaanon ne minimum samarthan mulya badhaane kii maang ko lekar hadtaal shuru kii
 This protest by the farmers gradually took violent form
 jiskaa dushprinaam ye hua ki police kii firing main 6 kisaanon kii maut ho gai
 While many were seriously injured
 isi din nasik main do kisaanon ne aatmahatya kar lee
 Apart from Madhya Pradesh, farmers in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Gujarat have also come forward to the government with their demands
 kisaanon kii aay doguna karne kaa daawa karne vaali bijepi kii sarkaar vaale chaar rajyon main hi kisaan virodh pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Now the question is arising that why are the farmers agitating only in the BJP government states? Also, can PM Modi's announcement in UP be a challenge for the BJP in Mission 2019? Actually, the decision of the Yogi government of UP is being considered in the backdrop of farmers 'protest in the four states, in which the farmers' Debt waiver was announced
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan piem modi ne saarvajanik manch se soobe main bijepi sarkaar banane par pehali cabinet main kisaanon kaa karj maaf karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 According to the promise, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in his first cabinet meeting, waived the outstanding debt of more than 36 thousand crores of farmers
 yogi sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad duusare rajyon ke kisaanon main bhi ek ummid jaagi
 This expectation has now reached stubbornness
 maharashtra ke kisaanon ne fadanvis sarkaar ko apni maangon kaa prastaav bheja
 Farmers' organizations also had a meeting with them, but with no results
 jiske baad kisaanon ne andolan kii shuruyaat kar di
 a large number of farmers took to the streets
 virodh mensadakon par doodh baha diya, haive par subjiyon kaa ambara laga diya
 Apart from loan waiver in Maharashtra, farmers have also asked for some more
 -swaminathan ayog kii siforishein lagu karnaa-kheti ke liye bina byaaj ke karj de sarkaar-60 saal ke umr vaale kisaanon ko pension di jaae-doodh ke liye prati litre 50 rupee mileupi sarkaar ke faisle kaa asar sirf madhyapradesh yaa maharashtra main hi dekhne ko nahin mila
 But in Gujarat and Rajasthan, its influence is visible
 gujarat ke banaaskantha main kisaanon ne aalu ke bhav or kheti ke liye pani na milane ke kaaran kadaa virodh jataayaa he
 The farmers demonstrated by throwing potatoes on the streets
 vahiin madhyapradesh seemaa se sate rajasthan ke pratapgarh main main kisaan aawaaj buland kar rahe hai
 Farmers are demonstrating the ten-point demands, including raising the support price of their produce
