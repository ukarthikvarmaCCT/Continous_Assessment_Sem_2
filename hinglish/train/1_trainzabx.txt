 com Bangla and Gujarati Dalit literature is very rich in creative writing
 yahaan aatmakathaaon kaa utana dabaav nahin jitna hindi yaa marathi main he
 Instead of making the autobiographical genre its identity, more fiction is being shown in fiction
 bangla main rikhshachaalak se upanyaaskaar bane manoranjan vyapaaree kaa chandaal jivan bikri or lokapriyata ke shikhar chhu rahaa he to gujarati ke varisht dalit lekhak dalpat chouhan kaa naveenatam upanyaas bhar bhankhalu samvedansheel pathakon ke bich charchaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 Autobiographical elements are often found in the novel
 in upanyaason main bhi ve tatv hai
 More than usual
 aatmakatha main jo baaten sensor kar di jaatin, ve yahaan aakanth bhav se darj kar di gai hai
 Relieving the anticipated burden of self-aggrandizement and the elimination of the possibility of bringing the surviving people into the plot into an awkward situation
 upanyaas beshak pramanikta kaa koi daawa na kare lekin samvedansheeltaa, rachanaatmak vishwasaneeyata ke maamle main ikkis hi thahartaa he
 Dalpat Chauhan has composed a trilogy of his novels, in addition to Bhakhalu, Mulak and Vulture
 mulak unka pehla upanyaas he, jisane unki pahchaan banaai
 Dr

 Desolation from one place to another can be called improvised migration
 iske liye visthaapan shabd bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he lekin ujadane main jo pidaa he, vah na to deshaantaran main aa sakati he or na visthaapan main
 The product in Bengali is synonymous with it
 gujarati main iske liye hizrat shabd prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 Hijrat is a term associated with the life of Dalits
 mulak upanyaas main hizrat centre main he
 Although the translator has kept the word 'deshradan', the word hijrat seems to be close to the original
 bhartiya bhashaaon main aapas main anuwaad karte samay aise avadharanatmak shabd apane mul rup main hi rakhe jane chahie
 This increases the proximity of both the source language and the target language
 mulk main hote 'e mulk se bedakhli, vatan ke bheetar jalavatan hone kaa dansh is bhukhand ke daliton kaa puraatan or sanathan anubhav he
 This is the story of this Hijrat in Mulk

 This cent percent is applied to Dalits
 agar is samudaay kaa koi sadsy 'chook' karata he to uski sajaa samooche samudaay ko di jaati he
 If you keep in mind the events that happen around us, then this thing can be easily understood

 The Chaudhary family of the village dominates the weavers

 Older elders are surprised when she is pregnant

 The news spreads like a fire in the forest

 The village Dalits have survived the burning, in the same sense that the novel is Sukhant

 What kind of happiness is this, in which the Dalits had to be uprooted, evicted from the land of their ancestors

 The citizens of civilized society are left searching for the answer

" sabase acha hoga ki smudi banaaen or kriim, doodh or dahi jaise dugdh utpaadon ke saath milakar khaaen
 He said, 'when spinach is cut into small pieces, more lutein is released and the fat added to milk products increases the solubility of lutein
 jitna zyada lutine smudi main ghulata he, sharir main utana hi zyada avashoshit hota he
 'at the same time, when spinach is cooked at high heat for a long time, the nutrients of green vegetables are completely wasted

 is act se sabhi alpsankhyak bhaaiyon-bahanon ko ratti bhar bhi nuksaan nahin hone vaala
 In an interview with India Today / Aajtak news director Rahul Kanwal in 'agenda Aaj Tak', Home Minister Amit Shah said, 'I want to tell all the minority brothers and sisters of the country through' Aaj Tak 'that this act will give you Not even a lot of damage is going to happen because no citizenship is lost by one act

 Where did all these Muslims go
 inkaa dharm parivartan kara diya gaya

 After the debate on Lokpal today, the government and the main party opposition has agreed to hold voting
 sadan main dhvanimat se prastaav paarit hoga
 Negotiations between Team Anna and the government were stuck about this
 anna ke sahyogi prashanth bhushan ne kaha tha ki jan lokapal ke mudde par loksabhaa main sirf charchaa hamaari maang nahin he
 He said that it is unfortunate that there is no resolution in the Lok Sabha and no voting
 prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki hamen bataaya gaya ki koi prastaav nahin hoga, koi matvibhaajan nahin hoga
 He said that if there is such a response to Anna Hazare's letter, it is quite unfortunate
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko likhe patr main anna ne teenon pramukh muddon - lokapal kii tarah rajyon main lokayuktaon kii niyukti, iske daayre main sabhi karmchaariyon ko laane or naagarik charter par sansad main matdaan ke jariye ek prastaav paarit karaane ko kaha tha
 He said that he is not satisfied with only discussing these issues in Parliament
 desh kii janata ko yah jaanane kaa adhikaar he ki unke saansad in muddon par kya rukh apanaate hai, isliye matdaan jaruri he
 Bhushan also said that if the resolution is not passed through voting on these issues, then Anna Hazare himself will take a decision about breaking the fast

 vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne lokapal mudde par charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue kaha ki lokapal ke gathan ke liye itihaas ne sansad ko yah ek aitihaasik mauka diya he or is avasar se hamen chuknaa nahin chahie
 He said that if we miss this opportunity today, the generations to come will not be free from corruption
 unhone lokapal ko sarkari niyantran se mukt kiye jane ke liye isamen sarkari paksh ko kam mahatv die jane tathaa ek santulit rasta apanaae jane kaa suzav diya
 But at the same time, disagreed with the provision of the Lokpal of Anna Team to see corruption in every case of delay in discharge of their duties by government employees
 nichle str kii naukarshahi ko adhik javabdeh banaae jane se bhi unhen ekamat jaahir karte hue kaha ki chote str ke bhrashtachar se janata adhik pareshaan he or yahi kaaran he ki deshbhar main janata andolit he

 team india or ireland ke bich do maichon kii tii-20 siries kaa doosraa or aakhri muqabla shuukravaar raat 8:30 baje se dublin ke malahide cricket club ground main khelaa jayega
 India beat Ireland by 76 runs in the first match played on Wednesday
 jiske baad bhartiya team duusare tii-20 match main ireland ko maat dekar siries jeet ke saath england ke liye ravaanaa hona chaahegi
 India did not face any kind of trouble in the first match
 rohit sharma or shikhar dhawan kii jodi ne team india ko bada score pradaan kiya jiske baad yujavendra chahal or kuldeep yadav ne ireland ke ballebaajon ko wicket par pair jamaane kaa mauka nahin diya
 Team indiateam India would like to try the bench strength in the second and final T20 match against Ireland so that everyone gets an idea of the pitch for the challenging tour against England
 bharat ne rohit or dhawan ko daure ke pehle simit over charan ke liye salaami jodi ke pehle pasandida vikalp main chunaa
 This confirmed that Rahul would bat in the middle order whenever he got the chance and it could also be in the next match very soon
 kohli kii pratikriya se yah andaja nahin lagata ki bharat gendbaaji akraman main bhi bade badlaav karegaa yaa nahin
 Still there are some players who cannot be accommodated like Rohit, Dhawan and Kohli himself, Dhoni and two leg-spinners
 bharat ko is baat se phayda hoga ki duusare tii-20 match kii pich ke bhi usee tarah kii hone kii ummid he jaisi pehle tii-20 kii thi
 Kuldeep and Chahal were able to benefit from the pitch and Ireland captain Gary Wilson even went as far as to say that they would bowl first or later
 agle chaar tii-20 maichon main vipakshi team ko chaunkaane utrenge kohlivahin bharat ek atirikt gendbaaj ko team main shaamil karne ke liye ek ballebaaj kam bhi utaarne kaa jokhim uthaa saktaa he
 Kohli's mantra to try bench players can also be applied in bowling attack, in which Umesh Yadav and Siddharth Kaul are desperate to do better
 yah saaf dekha ja saktaa tha ki team prabandhan bhubaneshwar kumaar or jasprit bumraah ko baahar karne ke liye bilkul taiyaar nahin he
 At the same time, Kohli was out on zero after playing two balls, so he too would like to spend some time at the crease
 haalanki is par chintaa karnaa abhi jaldbaaji hogi, haalanki isse 2014 main unki samasyaon kii yaad taaja ho jaati he, jisamen vah ran nahin juta sake the
 Barring the changes in the team, India will be a strong contender in the second match, given the strength of batting and bowling
 fielding alag maamla he or koching staff bhartiya khilaadiyon se pehle tii-20 kii tulana main behatar pradarshan kii ummid karegaa
 Kuldeep had taken four wickets in the previous match while Chahal had three successes
 duusare match main bhi yah jodi mejabaanon ke liye sirdard sabit ho sakati he
 Ireland failed to match India in the first match and proved to be weak in three areas of the game
 ireland ko apane khel ke str ko upar uthaanaa hoga
 Apart from bowling and batting, the fielding of the team was also very poor
 ballebaaji main ireland ke liye james shenon hi wicket par tik paae the
 He scored 60 runs in a fast-paced 35 balls
 unke alaava koi or ballebaaj duusare chor par khadaa nahin rah sakaa tha
 In bowling, Peter Chase had taken four wickets
 ireland ko agar barabari kerani he to use khel ke teen kshetron main sudhaar karnaa hoga
 Team India played 100 T20s, Dhoni alone played 90 matches for Ireland in the first match was far from reach, he tried his best to hit the crease but could not do so
 haalanki apni sarajameen par vah hairaan bhi kar saktaa he
 Teams: India: Virat Kohli (captain), Rohit Sharma (vice-captain), Shikhar Dhawan, KL Rahul, Manish Pandey, Suresh Raina, Dinesh Karthik, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (wicketkeeper), Hardik Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Bhuvaneshwar Kumar, Jaspreet Bumrah, Umesh Yadav, Siddharth Kaul

 The question of whether women are safe in the capital city is often rooted in everyone's mind
 iske jawaab ke liye dilli kii is mardaani kii kahani aapako jarur janani chahie
 In fact, this 26-year-old woman from North East lives with her sister and husband in Delhi's Window Extension
 mahila gruhani he or haal hi uski shaadi ek airforce afasar ke saath hui he
 The incident occurred on the night of 14 August
 mahila raat ke takreeban 11 baje apane ghar laut rahi thi
 The lady had climbed some steps of the house when a young man came from behind her and she pushed and dropped the woman
 iske baad wo uske saath dushkarm kii koshish karne laga
 The woman did not panic and shouted for help
 usne badmaash ke munh ko nakhunon se noch kar jakhmi kar diya tha
 Not only this, the woman beat a lot of crooks with her sandals and attacked her private part too
 mahila badmaash par baari padane lagi
 Hearing the woman's voice, her husband and sister arrived there, but by then the woman had alone bled the crook
 iske baad mahila ne 100 number par kol kiya or police ko ghatana kii jaankaree di, lekin mahila dilli police ke ravaiye se behad naaraaz thi
 The woman said that she complained about the incident with her at the Malviya Nagar police station
 pehle to police maamla darj karne main anakani kar rahi thi, magar kaaphi jaddojahad ke baad aakhirkaar police ne maamla darj kar liya
 The woman says that the police often patrol in this area, even then such an incident raises questions on the activeness of the police
 mahila kii is bahaduree par disipi robin hib ne use paanch hajaar rupaye or prashasti patr dekar sammanit kiya

 But if you take the assessment of the previous day's earnings into account, then the decline in collection is clearly visible
 ravivaar ko weekend hone ke naate shanivaar se zyada kamai kii ummid thi
 But there is a drop in the collection graph
 aise main somvaar ko manikarnika kaa collection aane vaale din main or bhi gir saktaa he
 So the movie will enter the 50 crore club in 1-2 days
 film kaa bajet 100-125 karod bataaya ja rahaa he
 If the earnings graph falls in the weekdays, it will be difficult to extract the budget for the movie

 He had said that if he played with the poor in medicine, he would cut off his hands
 maanjhi ne is bayaan ke ek din baad hi safai dete hue shanivaar ko kaha ki unhone aisa bayaan muhaavarey ke taur diya tha
 Explaining his statement in Patna, Chief Minister Manjhi said, "he should know the idiom of Hindi, which is creating a ruckus on his statement
 ' unhone kaha ki 'haath kaatane' kaa arth unka adhikaar samaapt kar dene se he, na ki unka sach main haath kaat dene se he
 It is a matter of understanding the statement correctly
 unhone muhaavarey ke vishay main kaha ki 'haath kaat dena', 'kad chota kar dena' kaa matlab adhikaar kam kar dene se he
 He further said that 90 percent of the doctors in the state work well, who have respect, but 10 percent of the doctors are careless about work
 gauratlab he ki mukhyamantri ne shuukravaar ko bihar ke motihaari main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha, "koi garib biimaar hota he to use log tang karte hai
 At first he is harassed by Ojha and when he reaches the hospital he is harassed there
 ' He warned such people, "such people will be put home

 For the past several weeks, the price of essential food products like onion, tomato, egg, oil and refined oil has been steadily increasing in the country
 centre sarkaar kuch utpaadon ke liye daawa kar rahi ki ijapha monsoon kii chaal yaa demand-supplai main disterbence ke chalate hua he
 However, it is believed that inflation is ready to knock in the country and these increases are just a sign
 inhen sanketon se sarkaar bhi sakate main he or lagaataar koshish kar rahi he ki desh main jaruri khaadya utpaadon kii demand-supplai main balance bana rahe
 Significantly, after the introduction of GST (goods and Services Tax) in the country from July 1, 2017, economic experts had expressed fears that the Indian economy might face a serious challenge of inflation
 is chunauti ke chalate desh main vikaas kii raftaar ko jhatka lagane ke saath-saath vyapak str par berogari kaa sankat bhi paidaa ho saktaa he
 Onion tears should not flow anywhere: Since last month, onion prices are once again headed to cross hundred
 maujuuda samay main retail market main pyaaj 80 rupee kilo bik rahi he
 The central government argues that this increase in prices is due to reduced area of onion sowing on the expectation of disturbance in the monsoon
 vahiin krishi vaigyanikon kaa bhi kahana he ki buaai ke rakabe main giravat ke chalate kharif pyaaj kii paidaavaar bhi kam rahegi
 However the reality is that despite this alert of monsoon and farming, a large quantity of rabi onion kept in cold storage was imported from the country from June to September
 ise bhi padhein: aasmaan chhu rahe andey ke daam, thok mulya main hui 15 fisadi badhotareeis emport ke chalate bazaar main demand-supplai disturb hui
 However, now that the situation on onion prices does not become uncontrollable, the central government has decided to ban onion exports
 is faisle ke mutabik 2015 ke baad ek baar phir desh se pyaaj export karne par baari-bharkam minimum export tex (minimum export price) adaa karnaa hoga
 Determining the minimum export price prohibits sending the product abroad for less than the fixed price
 haalanki is faisle ke baad kendra sarkaar ne philhal minimum export price kii dar nirdhaarit nahin kii he lekin sutron kaa daawa he ki 700-800 dollar prati ton kii dar kaa jald elaan kiya ja saktaa he

 Castor oil prices also increased in the non-edible oil segment due to the rise in consumer industries
 bazaar sutron ne kaha ki maang main teji se vanaspati milon kii baari liwali se mukhyat: khaadya tel keemton main teji ai
 At the same time last week, the central government increased the import duty of soybean oil to 12
 5 pratishat se badhaakar 30 pratishat, soyabean rifind tel par ise 15 pratishat se badhaakar 35 pratishat, kaccha pamatel par 15 pratishat se badhaakar 30 pratishat, arabidi palm tel par 25 pratishat se badhaakar 40 pratishat, surajamukhi kaccha tel par 15 pratishat se badhaakar 35 pratishat kar diya he
 The direct impact of this increase in import duty leads to increase in refined and oil prices in the country
 haalanki kendra sarkaar ne yah faisla kisaanon ke hit main liya he
 a new oilseed crop is ready in the country and the government has increased this in such a way that farmers can get good price for the crop due to expensive foreign produce
 baharhaal, yah tay he ki jabatak gharelu utpaada bazaar main pahonchega bade aayaat shulk se tel or rifind kii mahangaai kaayam rahegi
 Significantly, only 30 percent of the total demand for oil and refined in the country is met by domestic products

 between retail and wholesale inflation sparked debate among policy makers and economists as to what effect this difference would have on the central bank's monetary policy
 haalanki rigerv bank ne yah gananaa pramukh taur par vitt varsh 2015-16 ke dauraan badhati mahangaai ke sandarbh main kiya tha
 But the special thing is that after the introduction of GST in the country from July 1, once again the gap between retail and wholesale inflation is increasing

 input language perth main westeindies ke khilaaf hone vaale muqaabale se thik pehle viraat kohli ne khud hi ek aisa vivaad khadaa kiya, jiske chalate wo aalochanaon ke ghere main hai
 He committed indecency with an Indian sports journalist during a practice session
 unhone apshabdon kaa istemaal kiya or vah bhi tab jab us khel patrkaar se unki naaraazgi nahin thi
 He mistakenly thought of him as another journalist with whom he was angry
 kohli ke aise ravaiye kii aalochana honi chahie or khub ho bhi rahi he
 After all, Indian cricket is looking at him as the future captain, with every six and fours the media gives him praise
 aise main saarvajanik taur par kohli kaa ravaiya bataata he ki unamem paripakvata kii kami he
 The Indian Cricket Board has heard the rebuke and asked them to take care of the dignity of the team
 kohli kabhi ipel ke match main gautam gambhir se bhid jate hai to kabhi vipakshi team ke khilaadi david warner se ulajh jate hai
 At times, it seems that this is Kohli's fighting spirit, due to which when he tilts on the field, the opposition team's spirits do not feel late
 lekin agar kohli ko apni kshamta ke mutabik cricket ke aasmaan par lambey samay tak chhaae rahanaa he to unhen apane vyavhaar main sudhaar karnaa hoga
 In the same sentence, by going to the sports journalist and apologizing for his mistake, he could end the case, but he did not do so
 purv cricketer sunil gavaskar or vivies lakshmana ne bhi mana he ki viraat kohli ko khed jataakar maamla khatm karnaa chahie tha
 It is said that human beings learn from their mistakes
 ummid kerani chahie ki kohli bhi sabak lenge
 However, in the midst of these criticisms, there will be a big chance for Kohli to compete in Perth
 ve apni ballebaazi se agar team ko joardaar jeet dilaane main kaamyaab hote hai, to yahi bhartiya media kohli ke vyavhaar ko peeche chhod, unki tarif main kaside bhi padhegaa
 If Kohli plays a notable role in the victory of Team India, then the management of Team India can also send him a press conference and there he can publicly apologize to media persons
 viraat kohli ab tak perth ke maidan par koi shatak bhi nahin bana paae hai, to unke saamne is chunauti ko puraa karne kaa mauka bhi hoga
 Needless to say, India and the West Indies are being played on the day of Holi, Kohli has a chance to paint the media and sports fans in his own color
 jahaan ham aap kah sakate hai- bura naa maano 'kohli' he

 is laaparvaahee ke liye dijisie ne donon payalton kaa license radd kar diya he
 On one side of Jaipur's International Airport Parabundrywall is the Runway but just outside the boundary in such a way that the road remains 200 feet which is empty and looks like a runway
 indigo kii ahmedabad-jaipur flite 6i237 beete 27 farvari ko jaipur aa rahi thi

 Bharatiya Janata Party MP and former cricketer Gautam Gambhir on Saturday took a jibe at Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's speech at the United Nations (UN) and compared it to India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech

 ' vahiin, piem modi ne UNGC main kaha tha ki bharat ne duniya ko yuddh nahin buddha diya he jabaki imran ne ladaai kii baat ko tarjeeh di
 Speaking at the UNGC on Friday, Imran Khan also did not rule out the possibility of another war between the two nuclear-armed neighbors
 piem khan ne apane bhaashan main jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 ko hataane or vahaan jari panbadiyon kaa ullekh kiya tha
 He had said that removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir was a unilateral decision of India, after which the government divided Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh into two union territories

 bajrang dal ne maang kii he ki pathar maarane vaale or unke samarthakon se nipatane ke liye sena swatantra honi chahie
 The army should work in its own way to deal with them
 bajrang dal ke rashtriya adhyaksh manoj verma ne kaha he ki bajrang dal aisi ghatnaon ko bardaasht nahin kar sakati
 The Bajrang Dal says that the manner in which military personnel are being treated in Kashmir for the past long time is not good
 chand log or patharbaj javaanon kaa apmaan kar rahe hai unako pathar maar rahe hai
 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has also said in a statement that the Bajrang Dal will hold mass demonstrations in all districts across the country

 Donald Trump is now very close to becoming a Republican candidate as he has won a major victory in Indiana against his nearest rival Ted Cruz

 vahiin barney sanders ne apni democrat pratidwandi hillari clinton ko haraakar indiana primary chunaav main jeet hasil kar lee
 Accused of lying on Trump, it is worth mentioning that this election was also very special for Ted Cruz, for which he had put everything at stake
 krooj ne haalanki saaf-saaf nahin kaha tha ki indiana main pichhadane ke baad vah ummidavaari kii res se baahar honge yaa nahin lekin unhone kaha tha ki is chunaav ke baad vah ek 'khaas' sthiti main honge
 Earlier in an election campaign, Cruise was seen to be discouraged
 unhonadonald trump par tanjaksate hue kaha tha, 'yah aadmi sach bol hi nahin saktaa
 It mixes truth with complacency
 is tarah kii atmamugdhata desh main pehle kabhi nahin dekhi gai thi
 Cruise's anger for the accusation Trump had inflicted on Cruise's father had increased even more as he stated in a TV show that John F
 kennedy kii hatya main krooj ke pita kaa haath tha
 After this, Cruise had described Trump as "always a man of love" and in return, Trump said that cruises are getting more and more crazy day by day

 elahabaad hai court ne kareeb 9 saal 5 maah ke baad aarushi hatyakand main aaropee banaae gaye uske pita rajesh talwaar or maa noopur ko bari kar diya
 The Talwars have got a big gift this Diwali
 kah sakate hai ki saalon baad jalwaayu vihaar ke makaan sankhya- di-5 main is saal diwali ke deep jalenge
 The Talwar couple is relieved after a long wait of several years
 shuukravaar kii subah unhone jail main thik se naashtaa kiya
 At breakfast, they both ate a vegetable of puri and potato
 beeti raat donon khushi kii vajah se thik se soe bhi nahin
 According to jail sources, both of them were seen walking in their barracks
 may 2008 menarushi kii hatyake baad se hi talwaar danpati ko chaiyn nahin mila
 First, the police kept rotating this double murder case and then the rightful CBI completed the case
 gajiabad kii sibiai court ne is maamle par lambii sunwaayee karne baad 26 november, 2013 ke din talwaar danpati ko umrakaid kii sajaa sunai thi
 After which the Talwar couple appealed in the Allahabad High Court against the CBI court's decision
 isse pehle saal 2012 main dabl murder ke chaar saal baad aarushi kii maa noopur talwaar ko court main sarender karnaa padaa or phir jail janaa padaa
 On 26 November 2013, when the CBI court verdict came, Special CBI Judge S
 laal ne apane 208 pannon ke faisle main aaropee rajesh or noopur talwaar ko doshi qaraar de diya
 The whole matter changed from here
 lekin in sabake baavjood bhi talwaar danpati ne haar nahin maani
 In January 2014, Aarushi's father Rajesh and mother Nupur Talwar challenged the CBI court's verdict in the Allahabad High Court
 teen saal tak maamle par sunwaayee chalati rahi
 In August 2017, the Allahabad High Court said that Talwar would hear the couple's appeal again
 phir elahabaad hoicourt ne maamle par sunwaayee karne ke baad sitambar 2017 yani pichley maah aarushi hatyakand main faisla surakshit kiya
 And now, on Thursday, 12 October 2017, the High Court acquitted Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar in the aarushi-hemraj murder case after murder
 elahabaad hai court ne kaha he kitalwaar dampatine aarushi kaa katl nahin kiya
 Therefore, both should be released
 par kya is rihaai se pichley nau saalon ke gam or jakhm mit jaaenge? apni hi beti ke katl kaa sangeen iljaam sir par liye ji rahe maa-baap kya is sadame se kabhi ubar paaenge?sawaal un chaar -paanch saal kii kaid kaa nahin he jo talwaar dampatti ne jail main kaati
 This was not a punishment
 us sazaa ke aage jo apni hi beti ke kaatil hone kii tohamat talwaar danpati ne jheli, us sazaa kii tis umr bhar nahin jane vaali
 Sometimes in politics, ironic but pleasant irony becomes
 jaise nai dilli ke akbar road par congress kaa rashtriya mukhyalay he to ashok road par bijepi kaa
 Both Akbar and Ashok are among the greatest heroes of Indian history and the Congress BJP has ruled India in turn
 dilli pradesh bijepi kaa daftar jis pandit maarg par he wo gandhivadi daur ke kaddavar congress netaa govind ballab pant ke naam par he
 The Congress office of the state is on that Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Marg, which is considered as the ideology of BJP
 isi daftar main aaj congress adhyaksh arvinder singh lavali se milane pahunchaa
 In prime time, it was the turn of the Congress leader's interview after Arvind Kejriwal and Satish Upadhyay
 48 saal ke lavali ek jatke main daftar se baahar nikalakar nai dilli stesan se pehle padanevaale tilak brij ke platform par jane ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 This station falls behind the Congress office
 congress dilli main lagaataar teen baar jeetne ke baad vaapasi ke liye sangharsh kar rahi he
 History has been that wherever the Congress has reached the third position and its vote percentage is less than twenty percent, it has not been able to come back
 lavali iske baad bhi utsahit nazar aa rahe hai ki is baar main aap or bijepi donon se lard ladenge
 The sad sadness in the Congress office turned on his face
 har sawaal se bhidane lage
 Started talking in the form of slogans against AAP and BJP
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad congress netaaon kii akramakata chali gai he magar lavali main kisi tarah se baaki nazar ai
 Lovely clearly said that his fight was with BJP
 unhone ye raajnneetik line banaai he ki aap bijepi kii bi-team he
 Why does anyone who leaves from AAP go to BJP? kiran bedi se lekar wike singh or shazia ilmi tak sab bijepi main kyon gaye
 When i asked what you think about Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler, we responded with a thirst that when we feel that they are in the court of action, we cut his ticket, but he never went to jail
 media bijepi se kyon nahin poochta ki unke rashtriya adhyaksh par bhi to aarope he, ve rashtriya adhyaksh kaise ban gaye
 The media will not dare to question this
 lavali ne saaf kaha ki agar bijepi narendra modi ke chehre par chunaav main utregi to ham narendra modi ko nishaanaa banaayenge
 We will expose them
 hamaare paas unke kilaaf tarkon kii kami nahin he
 Lovely responded cleverly about Sheila Dixit
 kaha ki party faisla karegi, lekin shila kabhi congress kaa cheharaa nahin rahi hai
 The Congress never contested the election by declaring him the chief ministerial candidate
 lekin wo hamaari sammanit netaa hai or ham chahenge ki wo congress ke liye chunaav prachaar karen
 Lovely is more aggressive than the way the Congress general spokesperson appears to be weak
 unke hamale main dhar he or ladaaka vaala tatv bhi
 Keep saying how one choice can change all interpretations
 iske pehle yahi media rahul gandhi or manmohan singh kii kisi kisi tarif karata tha
 When we won in 2009, everyone used to say that voters in cities like us
 shahari voter ne bijepi ko khaarij kar diya he
 i kept saying to Lovely again and again that no expert or reviewer thinks about the prospects of the Congress coming back
 lavali kehete rahe ki koi baat nahin
 When the order to stay in the opposition has been received, then the head will serve by bowing but we will fight and come back
 is chunaav main ham vaapasi karenge
 OK, we have less money but this time we will also strengthen the publicity
 iske baad lavali tanj karte hai ki jo bijepi hamen bhrasht party kahati he uske paas prachaar ke itane paise kahaan se aa gaye or hamaare paas paise nahin hai
 Lovely Arvind and Satish Upadhyay are the three stubborn leaders of Delhi
 teenon baat-chit main kisi se dabate nahin hai
 They face questions
 chalate chalate jab aakhir main hamane up-rajyapal ke bare main poocha to lavali khud ko roak nahin paae
 Where Najib Jung did not fulfill his constitutional obligation
 maine poocha ki aapane aise vyakti ko kyon pad diya jisaki vaicharik nishtha kaa bharosa nahin tha
 Every leader plays the questions on his own
 cricketer kii tarah
 Lovely said that you interviewed the BJP president
 ham aapse poochne vaale the ki aap intervyuu lene pandit pant maarg gaye the yaa rajanivas
 Rajnivas is the residence of the Deputy Governor
 lavali kaa nishaanaa saaf tha ki najeeb jang congressi se ab bhaajapai ho gaye hai
 The election of Delhi is going to be quite interesting on the ground
 bijepi modi kii lokapriyata sabit karne ke liye ji jaan laga degi
 The Aam Aadmi Party will loot everything to save its existence
 congress do do chunaavon main maat khaane ke baad sar uthaane ke liye apni sari takat jhonk degi
 Let's see what the result is
 jaisaa ki aksar kahata hum
 The fun of the election is not in knowing the result of the survey, but in watching the entire film before the last scene
 film to chaalu hui he
 You look comfortable

 in / The Supreme Court has changed its earlier decision to play the national anthem before the film starts in theaters
 sheersh court ne kaha ki ab cinemaghar main film shuru hone se pehle raashtragan bajaanaa jaruri nahin hoga
 Earlier in November 2016, the Supreme Court made it mandatory to play and stand the national anthem in theaters
 isse pehle supreme court ne sanket die the ki vah ek disambar 2016 ke apane aadesh main sudhaar kar saktaa he
 According to this order, in order to inculcate the spirit of patriotism and nationalism, it was made mandatory to play the national anthem before the film's performance in theaters and for the audience to stand in its honor
 nyaayalay ne kaha tha ki jab raashtragan or rashtriya dhvaj ke prati sammaan darshaya jaataa he, to yah mathrubhumi ke prati prem or sammaan ko darshata he
 The court, on a public interest litigation by Shyam Narayan Choksi, had compulsorily directed the national anthem to be played before the film's release in all theaters
 haal hi mencendre sarkaar ne supreme courtmen ek shapathpatr daakhil kar kaha tha ki cinemagharon main film se pehle raashtragan bajaanaa or us dauraan khadaa hona anivaary na ho
 It was said on behalf of the government that the ministry committee is considering it right now
 maaloom ho ki supreme court ke nirdesh par centre sarkaar ne paanch disambar ko antar mantralay samiti kaa gathan kiya tha
 The central government had also appealed to the Supreme Court to reform its 2016 order by giving an affidavit
 centre sarkaar ne kaha tha ki haalanki antar mantralay samiti is par vichaar kar rahi he, lekin court khud hi raashtragan kii anivaaryta main dheel de de to behatar hoga
 At the same time, during the hearing, Justice Chandrachud had also said that people go for entertainment in cinema halls
 vahaan deshbhakti kaa kya paimaana ho isaki ek lakshmana rekha honi chahie
 Despite all this, the government is responsible for setting such notifications, circulars or mandates or rules
 supreme court par ye jimmedaari nahin thopi jaani chahie

 idhar, samiti ke vishesh kaary padaadhikari amit kumaar ne bhi kaha ki tirangaa fata nahin he

 a 37-year-old Pakistani-born doctor of Pakistani descent, who had been battling continuously for 48 hours to save the injured in the Manchester terror attack, was racially abused by a middle-aged British man and asked to return to his country as a terrorist
 trama or orthopedic sarjan navid yaccin peediton kaa ilaaj karne salford royal hospital ja rahe the, jab unhen ek adhed umr ke shaks pakad liya or aatanki kahkar gaaliyaan di

 You must also have heard many stories of Team India's strong link Virat Kohli and Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma's love affairs
 donon ke ek saath ek hi apartment main hone or newjiland main haath pakadakar ghoomane kii tasviren bhi dekhi hongi
 But what happened suddenly that Virat Kohli is seen in the arms of Ileana dicruz by releasing hands from Anushka
 haal hi main aapane dekha hoga ki kaise viraat ne shahrukh khan dwaara dikhaayi gai sabhi ladakiyon ko riject kar diya tha or phir unki dikhaayi gai koi tasviir bhi unhen pasand nahin aayi, lekin anoushka kii tasviir par wo maan gaye the
 Then what was Shah Rukh Khan going to do when he got married to Anushka for Virat
 lekin ye taaja khabar sunakar to anoushka or viraat donon ke prashansakon ko dukh hua hoga
 Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma came close for the first time due to the advertisement of a shampoo brand
 tabhi se donon apni vyasttaaon ke baavjood ek-duusare ke saath zyada se zyada samay bitaane kii har mumkin koshish karte hai
 So when it was reported that Anushka Sharma would not be with Virat in the next ed of the same shampoo brand, it was natural for both of her fans to be shocked
 haalanki shampoo brands ke agle vigyaapan main donon kaa ek saath nahin hona puri tarah se vyavsaayik kaaran he
 Anushka is busy shooting her films these days and does not have dates to add
 film ‘bombai velvet’ kii shooting puri karne ke baad anoushka apni home production film ‘enech10’ kii shooting main biji hone ja rahi hai
 Anushka's spokesperson said that despite her best efforts, she could not find time for this advertisement, as her film schedule was already ready
 haalanki shampoo brands ne antim samay tak anoushka kaa intjaar kiya ki kahin se wo kuch vakt is vigyaapan ke liye nikaal paaen, lekin aisa nahin ho paaya
 Nevertheless, it is believed that this is a one-time adjustment and Anushka will remain a part of the brand until their contract is over
 jab tak anoushka waapas nahin laut jaatin, tab tak viraat kohli is shampoo vigyaapan main eliana di-krooj ke saath najar aaenge

 The work that the government is spending lakhs and crores, you are doing the same work for free
 aam janata ko jiesti ke bare main sasta mahangaa ke frem main samajhaayaa ja rahaa he
 India's media does the same with the budget and the policy tricks or merits recorded in the budget do not reach the public
 do tarah kii jiesti he, ek state jiesti, jo rajya ke khate main jamaa hogi, doosraa centre jiesti jo centre ke khate main jamaa hogi
 Suppose Ramesh Chand, a merchant from Jaipur, sells his goods to Suresh Chand, a dealer in the same city, for 10 lakhs
 maan lijie 9 fisadi state or 9 fisadi centre jiesti he
 Accordingly, Ramesh takes 90,000 tax as state GST and 90,000 centers as GST
 ye paisa ramesh donon khajaane main jamaa kara dete hai
 Now Suresh ji, 10 this goods to Mahesh Chand of Jodhpur
 50 lakh main bechate hai
 GST will be charged by whoever sells it
 to suresh ji 94,500 state jiesti or 94,500 centre jiesti mahesh ji se vasuul le lete hai
 Now the question comes whether Suresh ji will also deposit 94,500 rupees in state GST
 jawaab he nahin
 Since Suresh ji has given 90,000 state and 90,000 centers as GST to Ramesh ji, he will deduct this money from the GST given earlier
 yani donon jagahon par 94,500 main se 90,000 mines ho jaae
 In this way, they will deposit 4500 rupees in the state GST account and the same center will deposit it in the GST account
 ummid he ki aaj mere skool ke ganit ke teacher 'prime time' nahin dekh rahe honge, varna unhen sadma lag saktaa he ki jo ladkaa ganit main phiseddi tha wo tivi par desh ko jod-ghataav kaise samajha rahaa he
 Let me tell you that i have taken the book of Sudhir ji, i have not set my mind
 jiesti ke saath puraane kar samaapt ho jaaenge magar ek rajya se duusare rajya ke bich maal le jane par ek nai vyavastha se guzaranaa hoga jiskaa naam he integrated guds and sarvice tex
 During this time road permit tax has to be paid, which is not yet removed
 suresh halaakhandee maanate hai ki road permit tex to dene honge
 So is it tax in addition to GST
 agar aisa he to phir jiesti ek kar kaise he
 Integrated GST is not a new tax but a new system
 iske zariye do rajyon ke bich vyapaar par nazar rakhi jaaegi
 It is being said that this will complicate the process
 kaise jatil hogi, jab main ise padhane laga to chakkar aa gaya
 Then left and understand what you see in the advertisements
 vaise suresh ji ne kaaphi saral tareeke se samajha diya he lekin tivi par samayabhaav or jagahabhav ke kaaran ham use chhod rahe hai
 If history is being made, you should also do some hard work
 ab aate hai ritern par
 Three returns have to be filed every month which will be different from each other
 GSTR-1, masik bikri kaa vivaran hoga jo agle maheene kii das taarikh tak jamaa karnaa hoga
 GSTR-2 will be the details of the monthly purchase which has to be submitted by the 15th of the next month
 10 taarikh se pehle jamaa nahin kar sakate kyonki aapako das tak bikri kaa vivaran jamaa karnaa hoga, isliye aap kharid kaa vivaran 10 ke baad hi 15 taarikh tak jamaa karne honge
 GSTR-3 This is the monthly tax return which has to be submitted by the 20th of the following month
 GSTR-9 ye vaarshik ritern he jo vitt varsh kii samaapti ke baad 31 disambar tak jamaa karne honge
 Thus, 37 returns have to be filled in the entire year
 yah ritern sarkaar ne jo jiestn network banaaya he vahaan jaakar bharne honge
 In the past, you were paying VAT and filling online only
 sudhir halaakhandee ne likhaa he ki isse jude praavdhaanon ke paalan ke liye kaaphi mehnat kerani hogi, balki samay kii mushkil seemaa kaa bhi paalan karnaa hoga kyonki jabatak pehla vikreta ritern nahin bharegaa, tab tak usase kareedne vaala apana ritern nahin bhar sakegaa
 As soon as this happens, the entire chain will break and the system will know
 is antar ko thik karne ke liye sirf do maheene kaa samay diya gaya he
 If the first dealer did not fill the returns, closed the shop and disappeared, then the same amount of GST you have given to him, you will replenish the same amount
 agar pehle vaale kaa vichaar badal gaya or usne bhar diya to aapako wo rakam waapas mil jaaegi
 Now you will say how do we know that the dealer you are buying the goods from is trustworthy
 to iske liye jiesti kii site par dealron kii reating di jaaegi
 Every trader will be able to see the rating of another trader which will be on the GSTN site
 ab aate hai bill par
 On 1 July you go to your shop
 graahak ko maal bechate hai to pehla jiesti bill kaise kaatenge
 Apart from computer, you can get your bill book printed under GST
 maan lijie ki aap kapadaa vyapaaree hai
 On Saturday, when a customer arrives at your shop and buys 100 shirts, how to make the bill
 kul 15 prakaar kii jaankaree honi chahie aapke paas
 Seller and buyer must have name, address and GSTN number
 bill jari karne kii taarikh, uskaa serial number bhi hona chahie
 You have to enter the description, quantity and total price of the goods
 dealer ke dastakhat anivaary hai
 There will be three copies of each bill
 ek aap rakhenge, doosraa kharidaar ke paas or teesraa transporter ke liye
 You should get it printed
 tippaniyan Every merchant has to bear the cost of printing
 jiesti ke tahat sazaa kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 Are there provisions for arrest under GST
 kya isse choti moti naadaani aapako jail main pahunchaa degi, ye ashanka he yaa vaaki aisa he
 They also try to know
 suresh ji ne hindi main likhaa he ki jiesti kii dhara 69 main giraftaar ke praavdhaan diye gaye hai
 If someone has committed a crime under 132 then one can get arrested
 sijisti adhikari giraftaar karegaa or aadesh ayukta kaa hoga
 Some offenses are non-bailable and some are bailable
 bagaiyr ayukta ke aadesh ke giraftaar nahin ho sakegi
 Will supply goods without bills, with the intention of evading tax
 bina jiesti liye bill jari karne par jail ja sakate hai
 Will not go to jail for three months after taking GST
 agar 2 karod se zyaada kii chori he to giraftaar ke praavdhaan lagu hote hai
 That is, you can avoid going to jail for tax evasion of less than 2 crores
 madhyam or chote shrenee ke dealer ko darane kii zarurat nahin he
 But if you violate GST twice then you can go to jail
 tab yah nahin dekha jayega ki 2 karod kii kar chori kaa aarope he yaa nahin
 0 percent, 5 percent, 12 percent, 18 percent and 28 percent tax are under GST
 aavashyak vastuon ko jiesti se baahar rakhaa gaya he to kai chizein aisi hai jo pehali baar tex ke daayre main aaengi

 You should get it printed
 tippaniyan Every merchant has to bear the cost of printing
 jiesti ke tahat sazaa kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 Are there provisions for arrest under GST
 kya isse choti moti naadaani aapako jail main pahunchaa degi, ye ashanka he yaa vaaki aisa he
 They also try to know
 suresh ji ne hindi main likhaa he ki jiesti kii dhara 69 main giraftaar ke praavdhaan diye gaye hai

 sijisti adhikari giraftaar karegaa or aadesh ayukta kaa hoga

 Will supply goods without bills, with the intention of evading tax
 bina jiesti liye bill jari karne par jail ja sakate hai
 Will not go to jail for three months after taking GST
 agar 2 karod se zyaada kii chori he to giraftaar ke praavdhaan lagu hote hai
 That is, you can avoid going to jail for tax evasion of less than 2 crores
 madhyam or chote shrenee ke dealer ko darane kii zarurat nahin he
 But if you violate GST twice then you can go to jail
 tab yah nahin dekha jayega ki 2 karod kii kar chori kaa aarope he yaa nahin
 0 percent, 5 percent, 12 percent, 18 percent and 28 percent tax are under GST
 aavashyak vastuon ko jiesti se baahar rakhaa gaya he to kai chizein aisi hai jo pehali baar tex ke daayre main aaengi
 GST is being explained to the general public in the frame of cheap expensive
 bharat kaa media bajet ke saath bhi yahi karata he or bajet main darj nitigat chaalaakiyaan yaa khubiyaan janata tak nahin pahunch paati hai
 There are two types of GST, one is the state GST, which will be deposited in the state account, the other is the center GST which will be deposited in the account of the center
 maan lijie jaipur ke vyapaaree ramesh chand usee shahar ke dealer suresh chand ko 10 lakh main apana maal bechate hai
 Suppose 9% state and 9% center is GST
 is hisaab se ramesh 90,000 tex state jiesti ke rup main le lete hai or 90,000 centre jiesti ke rup main
 Ramesh deposits these money in both treasures
 ab suresh ji is maal ko jodhpur ke mahesh chand ko 10
 50 lakhs
 jo jisko bechega wo usase jiesti vasulegaa
 So Suresh ji collects 94,500 state GST and 94,500 center GST from Mahesh ji
 ab sawaal aata he ki kya suresh ji bhi 94,500 rupee state jiesti main jamaa karenge
 The answer is no
 chunki suresh ji 90,000 state or 90,000 centre jiesti ke rup main ramesh ji ko de chuke hai, isliye ye paisa wo pehle di gai jiesti se gata denge
 That means 90,000 out of 94,500 at both places
 is tarah se ve 4500 rupee state jiesti ke khate main jamaa karenge or itnaa hi centre jiesti ke khate main jamaa karenge
 Hopefully my school's math teacher will not be watching 'prime time' today, or else he may be shocked how the boy who was a math loser is explaining the subtraction to the country on TV
 unke liye bataa duun ki maine sudhir ji kii kitaab tip lee he, apana koi dimaag nahin lagaaya he
 The old taxes will be abolished with GST, but when moving goods from one state to another, one has to go through a new system called Integrated Goods and Service Tax
 is dauraan road permit tex bhi dena hota he, jo abhi nahin hataa he
 Suresh Hhalakhandi believes that road permit tax will have to be paid
 to kya yah jiesti ke atirikt kar he
 If so, then how is GST a tax? integrated jiesti koi nayaa kar nahin he balki nayaa tantra he
 Through this, the trade between the two states will be monitored
 kaha ja rahaa he ki isse prakriyaayein thodi jatil ho jaaengi
 How complicated it would be when i started reading it
 phir chhod diya baaki aap jo vigyapanon main chapa he use dekhakar samaj len
 Although Suresh ji has explained it in a very simple way, but due to timeliness and vigor on TV, we are leaving him
 itihaas ban rahaa he to thodi mehnat aap bhi kiijie
 Now come to the return
 har maheene teen ritern bharne honge jo ek-duusare se alag honge
 GSTR-1 will be the details of the monthly sales which have to be submitted by the 10th of the next month
 GSTR-2 masik kharid kaa vivaran hoga jo agle maah kii 15 taarikh tak jamaa karnaa hoga
 Can't submit before 10 date because you have to submit the details of the sale till ten, so you will have to submit the details of the purchase only after the 15th
 GSTR-3 ye masik kar kaa ritern he jo agle maah kii 20 taarikh tak jamaa karne honge
 GSTR-9 is the annual return which has to be submitted by 31 December after the end of the financial year
 is prakaar puure saal main 37 ritern bharne honge
 The GSTN network created by the government will have to be returned
 aap pehle bhi waite vagairah online hi bhar rahe the
 Sudhir Hhalakhandi has written that it will have to work very hard to follow the provisions related to it, but also to adhere to the difficult time limit because till the first seller returns, the buyer will not be able to fill his returns
 aisa hote hi puri chen main brake aa jayega or system ko pataa chal jayega
 Only two months have been given to correct this gap
 agar pehle dealer ne ritern nahin bharaa, dukaan band kar gaayab ho gaya to jo jiesti aapane use di he, utani hi rakam aap dobaaraa bharenge
 If the idea of the former changed and filled it, you will get that amount back
 ab aap kahenge ki hamen kaise maaloom ki jisase maal kharid rahe hai wo dealer bharosemand he
 So for this, the rating of dealers will be given on the site of GST
 har vyapaaree duusare vyapaaree kii reating dekh sakegaa jo jiestn kii site par hogi
 Now come to the bill
 1 july ko aap apni dukaan par jate hai
 If you sell goods to the customer then how to deduct the first GST bill
 jiesti ke tahat aap computer ke alaava apni bill book bhi chhapava sakate hai
 Suppose you are a cloth merchant
 shanivaar ko aapaki dukaan par koi graahak pahunchataa he or 100 shart kharidta he to bill kaise banaayenge
 You should have a total of 15 types of information
 vikreta or karidaar kaa naam, pataa or jiestn number zarur hona chahie
 The date of issue of the bill should also be its serial number
 maal kaa vivaran, maatra or kul keemat aapako darj karnaa hoga
 Dealer signatures are mandatory
 har bill kii teen prati hogi
 One you will keep, the other with the buyer and the third for the transporter
 ise aapako chhapava kar rakh lenaa chahie
 The comments chhapavane kii laagat har vyapaaree ko khud uthaani padegi
 There is also a provision of punishment under GST
 kya jiesti ke tahat giraftaar ke praavdhaan hai
 Is it a little silly that will lead you to jail, is it a doubt or is it really so
 ye bhi jaanane kaa prayaas karte hai
 Suresh ji has written in Hindi that under Section 69 of GST, provisions for arrest have been given
 agar kisi ne 132 ke tahat aparaadh kiya he to giraftaar ho saktaa he
 The CGST officer will make the arrest and the order will be that of the commissioner
 kuch aparaadh gair jamaanti hai or kuch jamaanti
 Arrests will not be held without the order of the Commissioner
 bina bill kaa maal supplai karenge, kar chori ke iraade se
 One can go to jail for issuing a bill without GST
 jiesti lekar teen maheene tak jamaa nahin karne par jail jaaenge
 If there is theft of more than 2 crores then the provisions of arrest apply
 yani 2 karod se kam kii kar chori par jail jane se batch sakate hai
 The medium and small range dealer need not fear
 magar aap do baar jiesti kaa ulanghan karte hai to jail ja sakate hai
 Then it will not be seen whether there is a charge of tax evasion of 2 crores
 0 pratishat, 5 pratishat, 12 pratishat, 18 pratishat or 28 pratishat tex hai jiesti ke tahat
 If essential commodities are kept out of GST, then there are many things that will come under the tax ambit for the first time
 ummid he ki aaj mere skool ke ganit ke teacher 'prime time' nahin dekh rahe honge, varna unhen sadma lag saktaa he ki jo ladkaa ganit main phiseddi tha wo tivi par desh ko jod-ghataav kaise samajha rahaa he
 Let me tell you that i have taken the book of Sudhir ji, i have not set my mind
 jiesti ke saath puraane kar samaapt ho jaaenge magar ek rajya se duusare rajya ke bich maal le jane par ek nai vyavastha se guzaranaa hoga jiskaa naam he integrated guds and sarvice tex
 During this time road permit tax has to be paid, which is not yet removed
 suresh halaakhandee maanate hai ki road permit tex to dene honge
 So is it tax in addition to GST
 agar aisa he to phir jiesti ek kar kaise he
 Integrated GST is not a new tax but a new system
 iske zariye do rajyon ke bich vyapaar par nazar rakhi jaaegi
 It is being said that this will complicate the process
 kaise jatil hogi, jab main ise padhane laga to chakkar aa gaya
 Then left and understand what you see in the advertisements
 vaise suresh ji ne kaaphi saral tareeke se samajha diya he lekin tivi par samayabhaav or jagahabhav ke kaaran ham use chhod rahe hai
 If history is being made, you should also do some hard work
 ab aate hai ritern par
 Three returns have to be filed every month which will be different from each other
 GSTR-1, masik bikri kaa vivaran hoga jo agle maheene kii das taarikh tak jamaa karnaa hoga
 GSTR-2 will be the details of the monthly purchase which has to be submitted by the 15th of the next month
 10 taarikh se pehle jamaa nahin kar sakate kyonki aapako das tak bikri kaa vivaran jamaa karnaa hoga, isliye aap kharid kaa vivaran 10 ke baad hi 15 taarikh tak jamaa karne honge
 GSTR-3 This is the monthly tax return which has to be submitted by the 20th of the following month
 GSTR-9 ye vaarshik ritern he jo vitt varsh kii samaapti ke baad 31 disambar tak jamaa karne honge
 Thus, 37 returns have to be filled in the entire year
 yah ritern sarkaar ne jo jiestn network banaaya he vahaan jaakar bharne honge
 In the past, you were paying VAT and filling online only
 sudhir halaakhandee ne likhaa he ki isse jude praavdhaanon ke paalan ke liye kaaphi mehnat kerani hogi, balki samay kii mushkil seemaa kaa bhi paalan karnaa hoga kyonki jabatak pehla vikreta ritern nahin bharegaa, tab tak usase kareedne vaala apana ritern nahin bhar sakegaa
 As soon as this happens, the entire chain will break and the system will know
 is antar ko thik karne ke liye sirf do maheene kaa samay diya gaya he
 If the first dealer did not fill the returns, closed the shop and disappeared, then the same amount of GST you have given to him, you will replenish the same amount
 agar pehle vaale kaa vichaar badal gaya or usne bhar diya to aapako wo rakam waapas mil jaaegi
 Now you will say how do we know that the dealer you are buying the goods from is trustworthy
 to iske liye jiesti kii site par dealron kii reating di jaaegi
 Every trader will be able to see the rating of another trader which will be on the GSTN site
 ab aate hai bill par
 On 1 July you go to your shop
 graahak ko maal bechate hai to pehla jiesti bill kaise kaatenge
 Apart from computer, you can get your bill book printed under GST
 maan lijie ki aap kapadaa vyapaaree hai
 On Saturday, when a customer arrives at your shop and buys 100 shirts, how to make the bill
