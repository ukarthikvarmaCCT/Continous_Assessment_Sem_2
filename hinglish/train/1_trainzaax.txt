 a film i passionately believe in
 
 
 the last film my father worked on before he left us
 
 
 
 it was his dream to see this film come through
 
 
 
 i couldn't fulfill his dream then
 
 
 
 my spirit was broken
 
 
 
 but today his wish has found a relationship with celluloid
 
 
 
 the story of turbulent relationships and eternal love has found a voice
 
 
 
 the film has been woven, nurtured and visualized by ABHISHEK VARMAN
 
 
 
 and the film Is KALANK! Set in the 40's but it's heart lives on
 
 
 
 
 TOMORROW the journey begins
 
 
 
 
 am excited

 iske liye jari circular main rail mantralay ne shatabdi rajdhani or duranto express gadiyon main pehla chart banane ke baad bachi siton ke liye karant booking par kiraye main das pratishat kii chhot dene kaa faisla kiya he
 According to railway board member (traffic) Muhammad Jamshed, the railway neflexi fair system was implemented on 9 September
 iske lagu hone ke teen maah baad uski samiksha kii gai he
 Jamshed described the Flexi Fair system as successful and informed that after the implementation of this system, the Railways earned an additional Rs 130 crore
 unhone bataaya ki railway ne ab tay kiya he ki pehla chart banane ke baad karant booking kii tikat par aakhri tikat ke kiraaye se das fisadi kam kiraaya liya jayega

 ) India is one of the largest markets for two-wheelers in the world
 lakhon log har saal nai bike kharidte hai
 But they all fade in front of the passion of bike collectors, who are scouring the Internet and junkyards to include classic two-wheelers of iconic brands like the Czech country company Java
 haal hi jab anand mahindra ne elaan kiya ki ve is brands ko phir bharat main pesh karne vaale hai to twitor par log jhum uthe
 Who are these people who are addicted to the collection of old bikes? What are these machines whose prices are so high? Talking about harley-davidson and Indian brands, their prices are beyond the capabilities of the common man, their "basket case" is worth millions
 main hai
 Obviously, their buyers are very rich and they do not hold back in spending time on re-decorating these bikes, as their authentic parts are imported or manufactured by hand here
 bike ko nayaa luk dena bhi ek kala he or nae kalevar main ithlaati biken aksar kartie kankars jaisi pratispardhaa main jeet kaa paracham laharaati hai, jaisaa udyogpati arjuna oberoi kii indian chif ne pichley saal kar dikhaaya tha

 Model collectors such as BSA Golden Flash and Triumph Cube are items
 vaise trymph sareekhee bikon ke nirmaataa bike-maalikon ko clasik bike sanvaarane main bharpoor madad karte hai
 But to maintain the elegance of these classics, one has to depend on the experts who are lacking

 This section of the owners of Java and Yazdi bikes is enthusiastic
 ve bike ke kalpurje khojane or unhen chalaae rakhane ke liye bhi bazaaron or kaaryshaalaaon par ghanton vakt kharch karte hai
 When it comes to scooters, the models of Vespa are still ruling the market
 yajdi 350 twin bhi colectors item ban gaya he or iske maalik apni bike ko beintahaa pyaar karte hai
 For example, BJYMC founder member Brian Amanna already has Java 250
 twin ko apane sangrah main shaamil karnaa unke pita kaa sapana tha
 After years of searching, he found the twin and gave it a new look

 It was built at the Madras factory with 175 cc Villars to stroke single motor

 After 13 years, the verdict came in favor of Salman in the hit and run case but many questions are also arising with the verdict
 salmaan ke khilaaf pairvi kar rahi vakil abha singh ne bhi is par sawaal uthaae hai
 At about one and a half, Salman left the court for the court and the decision was pronounced as soon as he entered the court
 abha singh ne kaha, 'jin daleelon ke aadhaar par faisla sunaaya gaya he vah ascharyajanak hai
 It is a sad day
 ummid he ki maharashtra sarkaar iske khilaaf supreme court main apil karegi
 Salmanhaicourt, who was left out due to lack of evidence, said that the day before the verdict was given, there was an indication that Salman might be relieved, but on Thursday, just as he wrote the judgment in Salman Khan's case, the judge lacked evidence Speaking of this, it was clear that Salman Khan would not be punished
 jamaanat dene main bhi dikhaai gai jaldbaajiwaise yah pehali baar nahin he jab salmaan ke liye itani teji dikhaai gai ho
 On 8 May, when Salman Khan was sentenced to five years in Mumbai's sessions court, his lawyers hurriedly knocked on the high court's rate by taking a bail plea
 us vakt bhi court ne bina faisle kii puri copy kaa intjaar kiye salmaan khan ko do din kii antarim jamaanat de di
 Which also shows Salman's influence somewhere
 vakil abha singh ne may main kaha tha, 'jis teji se salmaan ke liye adaalat baithti he vaisaa kabhi aam aadmi ke liye nahin hota
 Now Salman Khan is not guilty but accused
 ' unhone kamaal khan kii gavaahi kaa mudda bhi uthaaya tha
 Waiting for the government to copy the decision, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said that he had not yet read the decision

 opi ravat ne kaha ki iske liye pehle puure desh main aam sahmati banani hogi
 But when asked how the idea of holding elections all over the country together, he refused to comment on this and said that he is responsible for holding elections and he cannot say anything about it
 aam aadmi party andolan kii party he, sadak kii party he
 Many top leaders, including party convenor Arvind Kejriwal, have been saying this many times and from many forums
 party main loktantr kii duhai dene vaali AAP main pichley teen dinon se jabardast ghamaasan machaa tha lekin kya wo ab tham chukaa he?party vidhayak amanatulla khan ne AAP ke sansthaapak sadsy or kejariwal ke dost kumaar vishwaas ko 'bijepi kaa agent' bataa diya
 After that, like Kumar took the initiative to teach Khan Kosbak
 party main bahriyon kii ghuspaith kaa aarope lagaate hue kumaar ne party ke sarvocch manch piesi main shaamil hone tak se inkaar kar diya
 Even publicly accusing Khan of making rhetoric at the behest of some 'other'
 party ne kumaar kii naaraazgi dekh khan ko piesi se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 First the heat then softened! Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia took up the task of replying to Kumar Vishwas and asked him to come on the party stage and give his advice
 tab laga ki ab kumaar kaa party main rahanaa mushkil he or wo party chhod sakate hai
 But by the evening, the wind changed and Arvind Kejriwal himself, along with Manish Sisodia, reached his house to convince Kumar
 phir uske baad kumaar ko lekar kejariwal apane ghar gaye vahaan der raat tak aalaa netaaon kii baithak hui
 Eventually Amanatullah Khan was suspended from the party and Kumar was put in charge of the assembly elections to be held in Rajasthan
 saarvajanik manch par jo bayaanbaji amanatulla khan ne kii thi thik usee tarah ke bayaan kumaar vishwaas bhi de rahe the
 But the punishment was only increased to Khan and his stature was increased by giving him a new responsibility
 kumaar kaa kad badhaparty main jis gaiyr jimmedaarana bartaav ke liye khan ko sajaa mili usee ke liekumar ko inaam kaisediya ja saktaa he
 Action was not taken on Kumar because he has been associated with the party since the time of the movement or there is some other reason for it
 beshak, party main kumaar kaa kad kaaphi bada he or wo number teen ke netaa maane jate hai
 But why did the AAP, which calls itself a democratic party, not behave on par here
 kumaar vishwaas par isse pehle bhi party ke khilaaf line lene ke aarope lagate rahe hai
 His latest patriotic video made a lot of headlines in social media, in which he was seen targeting Opposition leaders including Arvind Kejriwal
 vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan wo party ke liye prachaar karne bhi nahin utre baavjood iske party unke saamne kyon jhuki
 The anger of Kumar's face can be seen clearly in the photo of top leaders after the action on Amanatullah Khan
 jahaan sabhi netaa muskaraakar photo khinchaate najar aa rahe hai vahiin kumaar ke chehre par alag tarah kaa gussa he
 He has already said that if the comments made by Khan against Arvind or Manish would have been made, Amanatullah Khan would have stayed in the party
 isse saaf jaahir he ki party ne ab khan par karrwai kar ye jataa diya he ki unke liye kumaar zyada jaruri hai
 All parties keep claiming democracy

 '' England beat New Zealand by 119 runs on Tuesday to secure a place in the semi-finals of the ICC World Cup-2019 
 england ne 1992 ke baad se pehali baar world cap ke semifinal main jagah banaai he
 With this, Pakistan's dream of reaching the semi-finals has been shattered
 pakistan ke semifinal main pahunchane kii sambhaavna ab naa ke baraabar he
 Alam is that if Pakistan loses the toss against Bangladesh in the match on 5 July and Bangladesh chooses to bat first, then Pakistan will be out of the World Cup 2019 before the first ball is bowled
 kyonki aise haalat main pakistan kaa ran rate newjiland ke ran rate se kam ho jayega or pakistan kii team kaa semifinal main pahunchane kaa sapana adhuraa rah jayega
 At the same time, if Pakistan's team chooses to bat first by winning the toss against Bangladesh, then they will have to score 350 runs with the bat
 iske baad world cap ke itihaas kii sabase khatarnaak gendbaaji karte hue bangladesh ko 311 ranon ke bade antar se haraana hoga
 This means that if Pakistan scored 350 runs in 50 overs after batting first, then they would have to allout Bangladesh's team for 39 runs
 bataa den ki bangladesh kii team pehle hi world cap se baahar ho gai he
 Where is Pakistan in the point table? According to the point table, the teams of Australia, India and England have made it to the semi-finals

 If Yuvraj Singh, who has spoken about winning the World Cup for Sachin Tendulkar, has managed to make a great comeback after poor form and fitness problems, the credit also goes to this champion batsman

 shabnam ne kaha, yuvaraj ne vaapasi kii he, to apane guruon ke aashirwad or sachin kii vajah se
 He was so upset by the constant criticism that he could not understand what to do
 usne sachin se prerana lee, jo apane kariyar main kharaab daur se guzarakar shandaar vaapasi karte hue sheersh par pahunche
 Due to this, Yuvraj made a tremendous comeback today
 unhone kaha, jis tarah sachin apane balle se jawaab dene main vishwaas rakhte hai, vahi falsafa yuvaraj kaa he
 Shabnam said that during the World Cup, there was a lot of pressure on Yuvraj and he could not sleep peacefully for nights, but now he feels relaxed after winning the final
 unhone kaha, sabhi kii nazren usee par thim
 He used to get up many nights and sit
 use ultiyaan bhi hone lagi thi
 It was very difficult to play well under so much pressure, but i am proud that he did it
 yah poochne par ki vishwa cap jeetne ke baad uski pehali pratikriya kya thi, shabnam ne kaha ki use kuch samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha or vah khushi ke maare cheekh rahaa tha
 He said, after winning the quarter-final against Australia, he asked what would happen if we won the World Cup
 maine kaha ki bharat hi jitegaa, to uskaa jawaab tha ki main khushi ke maare pagal ho jaaoongaa
 Everyone saw his feelings on the field
 yah poochne par ki bataur khilaadi yuvaraj ke bheetar aae badlaav ko vishwa cap main sabhi ne dekha, lekin kya nijee jindagi main bhi vah badal gaya he, unhone naa main jawaab diya

 court ne kaha ki haalat ye he ki dilli main mahilaayein 7 baje ke baad akele surakshit mahasoos nahin karti
 The central government is not worried about the safety of the people and women of Delhi
 court ne kaha ki kendriya grih mantralay(mha) dilli police me nai 14 hajaar bhartiyon kii manjuuri de chuki he lekin Expenditure dept ne ye kahkar adanga laga diya he kii sarkaar ke paas itnaa paisa kharch karne ke liye nahin he
 How can it happen that even after the approval of MHA, the other department should stop the recruitment
 court ne kaha ki centresarkaar ke sabhi mantridilli main hi baithte hai, phir bhi isapar koi dhyaan nahin detaa
 The court said, 'even after all the leaders are sitting in Delhi, the central government is behaving half-way with Delhi

 " Smartpoles of Delhi are also scared of mobile phones, pens and diaries
 yahi vajah he ki police ne thane main in sab chizon ke le jane par bain laga diya he
 Madhuvihar and Mandavali police stations are in the same premises and there is a board at the gate of these two police stations, which clearly states that due to security, mobile phones, diaries, pens, handbags or any electronic items in any police station
 Can not carry kaagaj par bhi print lekar ise do taraf lagaaya gaya he, lekin is board par kahin bhi ye nahin likhaa he ki ye kiske aadesh par kiya ja rahaa he
 The police is being doubted by this new rule, because Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has installed boards at various places, in which it is being advised to sting bribes
 kejariwal apane poster main ghoosekhoron ko jail bhejne kaa vaada bhi kar rahe hai
 Now the question is that suddenly a new police order has come, there is no fear of sting behind it
 thane ke baahar kai logon ko behad hairaani hui jab unhen phone le jane se manaa kiya gaya
 Then people had to switch off the phone before going inside
 is tarah ke board abhi dilli ke kuch hi thanon main lage hai, police bhale hi iske peeche suraksha vajah bataa rahi ho, lekin dilli ke wo log jo thane ja chuke hai unhen iske peeche kaa matlab saaf samaj aa jayega

 The murderer had considered him dead and left the house, but his few breaths were still left
 wo ab bhi jinda tha par use pataa tha ki ab wo bas kisi bhi pal marane vaala he
 Anytime his breath will leave his breath
 sar badi mushkil se dhad se judaa tha
 One hand was separated from the body, fingers were cut, but still he did not lose courage
 dam nikalne se pehle ek aakhri baar usne apni sari takat laga di
 Dip one of the remaining fingers in your own blood somehow and write these ten words on the wall
 ghar kii diwaar par das shabd laal rangi kii kisi syaahi se nahin balki usne apane khun se likhe or das shabd likhane ke baad usne dam tod diya
 Spots of blood splattered all over the house are witness to how brutally he was murdered
 andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki khud kaatil ko bhi jaraa sa gumaan nahin tha ki unke waar ke baad wo kuch second bhi or jiega or isiilie wo use murda samaj kar vahaan se chal die or yaheen qaatil galati kar gaya kyonki jise wo murda samaj kar ghar se nikal gaye
 
 us murde main ab bhi kuch jaan baaki thi
 Guess the pain ek haath uskaa alag ho chukaa tha
 The fingers were amputated
 sar or dhad ke bich gaharaa waar tha
 The blood was flowing continuously
 sirf soch kar hi rongte khadey ho jate hai par usne himamt nahin haari
 He somehow absorbed all his last breaths and wrote a total of ten words on the wall by dipping his finger in his blood
 nau shabd ek diwaar par or dasvaan duusari diwaar par
 Who is this Murali and Money? Did he have enmity with the person? Why did they kill him? And is the name of the murderer hidden in this text written from the last breaths? To know the full truth of this heartbreaking story of murder, first listen to the whole story
 use khud ahsaas ho chukaa tha ki mummy-papa ke ghar lautne tak uski saanse uskaa saath nahin de paaengi
 There was not much time left to write anything on a piece of paper
 lihaaja apane kaatilon kaa naam likhane ke liye uske paas khud ke lahu ke alaava or kuch nahin tha
 The shocking incident took place on Wednesday night in Yamunanagar Railway Colony house number A-1
 is ghar main amit apane maa-baap, do bhai or bhabhi ke saath rahata tha buudhvaar ko ilaake main hi ek rishtedaar kii shaadi thi
 The whole family went to the same wedding
 ghar par bas akelaa rah gaya tha ghar kaa sabase betaa amit
 Meanwhile, some of the neighbors suddenly noticed late night that blood was seeping from under the door of Amit's house
 khun dekhte hi padosi ghabara gaye
 At first they thought that someone might have got hurt in the house
 lihaaja unhone darwaja kholaa to darwaja andar se khulaa mila par jaise hi wo log andar ghuse unki chikhen nikal gayi
 There was blood all over the house and Amit's blood-soaked corpse lay on the ground
 ghar ke manzar bataa rahe the ki kaatilon ne amit kaa qatl karne se pehle use khub tadpaaya kyonki ghar ke har hisse main khun failaa tha
 Kitchen, drawing room, bedroom was blood everywhere
 aisa lagata tha ki kaatil kisi bhi keemat par amit ko jinda nahin chona chahta tha
 Meanwhile, the eyes of the police and family members looked at the ten words written on the wall
 naam padhate hi gharavaale chaunk gaye
 According to Amit's maternal uncle, one of the friends of Amit's elder brother is one of the names in the blood written on the wall of the house
 gharavaalon ke mutabik amit ke qaatilon ne police ko gumraah karne ke liye ghar kaa sara saamaan idhar-udhar bikher diya tha
 All the shelves of the house were opened but none of the valuables were missing from the house
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki ghar main itani badi vaardaat ho gai or padasiyon ko isaki bhanak tak nahin lagi or naa hi qatl ke pehle yaa baad main unhone kisi ko ghar ke andar aate-jate dekha
 Not only this, nobody even heard Amit's screaming and shouting
 26 saal kaa amit ghar kaa sabase chota tha
 He was working in a private company
 padosiyon ke mutabik amit behad shant or milansaar ladkaa tha
 Being the youngest in the house, he was also dear to his father, but Amit's death has broken him
 vaise police ke mutabik ye baat tay he ki amit apane qaatilon ko jaanata tha kyonki ghar kaa darwaja todaa nahin gaya he
 That is, Amit used to recognize his killers and he opened the door and called them inside
 philhal police ke paas suraag ke naam par do sabase ahm naam hai jo khud amit ne apane khun se diwaar par likhe hai
 Now it has to be seen that when does she reach these names and are these two names really of Amit's slayer? america ke swasthya mantri tom price ne apane pad se istipha de diya he

 Actually, Sunny Deol and Kangana Ranaut starrer film 'I Love New York' has been in the box for the last 6 years
 2 saal pehle ise release karne kii koshish kii gai thi, jisaki press conferes bhi kii gai thi
 Kangana and Sunny Deol were also involved in this but due to some reasons the film could not be released
 ab ek baar phir is film ko release karne kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 As soon as we get the news of this, Kangana Daze has arisen because she feels that Bhushan Kumar is taking advantage of her name
 kangana ke vakil rigwaan siddiqi ne kaha kii "ye bada ajeeb he kii hamaari client kangana kii ijazat ke bina film ko release kiya ja rahaa he
 He did not even call for publicity
 6 saal se yah film bakse main band thi kyonki release karne laayak nahin thi magar tii-series kangana kii shoharat ko bhunaane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 '' rigwaan ne yah bhi kaha ki "kangana se vaada kiya gaya tha kii ukt film release nahin hogi magar ab tii-series apana vaada tod rahaa he
 This film will spoil Kangana's image
 " notice main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki kangana ko is film ke liye paise bhi nahin mili or agreement kii copy bhi nahin di gai

 At the same time, Kangana is also suffering the same sorrow that someone else is trying to take advantage of her fame
 isamen kuch galat bhi nahin he, kyonki produsar apane paise nikaalane kii koshish karegaa hi
 But Kangana should think that the film does not run without the fame of a hero or heroine other than a few
 film jab acchhee hoti he, tabhi chalati he
 If the film was successful on Kangana's fame, after the immense success of "queen", her films "revolver Rani" and "finger" were released and both these films were huge flops

 However, Indian women do not give much attention to love before marriage
 agar pyaar karti hai, to uskaa lakshya bhi shaadi hi hota he
 So whenever his heart falls on a man, it is a long term agreement like marriage, not a momentary feeling like 'one night stand'
 agar aap bhi kuch aisa hi sochati hai or aapkaa man kisi purush par aa gaya he
 If you want it to be a part of your life forever, then you have to do it for yourself

 iske liye aap ek garmagaram bahes kar sakati hai
 On the one hand, they will be aware of your thoughts, on the other hand you will be able to make them aware of your person rather than a copycat or just a yes yes girl
 to kya, agar aap kabhi kabhaar kisi bahes main haar jaaen
 In the end, you have to win
 galati par na karen avhelnaajab kabhi bistar par yaa sambandh banaate samay aapkaa saathi koi bahut hi bhaddi yaa badi galati kar baithe, to iske liye use taane na maaren
 At that time he himself can doubt his abilities, so it is important that you do not let his confidence waver at such a time
 unki galati ko sahajata se len or unhen samajhaayen ki wo forple ke dauraan bahut mast the, aisi galtiyaan hona laazmi he
 When you hear such things from your mouth, when the inner ear is less, then love will increase for you
 jab kaam main mili safaltapurushon ko kaam main safalataa or jeet paanaa bahut pasand he
 So whenever he does something good in his office and is excited for it, you too join him in happiness
 aise main unki jeet kii khushi ke liye unhen koi yaadgaar tohfa den
 If you want, you can feed them your handmade food
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav 20 sitambar ko lalitpur jile main sthit bajaj power plant kaa udghaatan karne aane vaale the, lekin isse pehle hi congress ne power plant par sawalia nishaan khadey karte hue andolan shuru kar diya
 The movement was led by former Union Minister of State for Rural Development Pradeep Jain Aditya
 unke mudde aise the ki hajaaron log saath khadey ho gaye
 For example, the district should first get the benefit of electricity being created in the district, local people should be given employment there
 14 sitambar ko andolankariyon ne power plant kaa gheraav kiya
 Suddenly the administration lost sleep
 adhikari mauka-e-vaardaat par pahunche, aashwaasano kaa pitara kholaa or andolan ko shant kiya
 But his questions are valid
 jis jile main pani, koyala or saura urja se bijli kaa utpaadan ho rahaa ho, usee jile ke logon ko din main baarah ghante bagaiyr bijli ke gujaarne padate hai
 Here 75 MW power is being generated from hydropower, 30 MW power is being generated from solar power plants and now Bajaj Power Plant, one of the largest thermal power plants in the state has also started generating electricity
 phir bhi shahar andhere main duba hua he
 Actually, this is the whole tragedy of Bundelkhand
 do saal pehle mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne bundelkhand ko pradesh kaa sabase bada urja hub banane or nai audyogic ikaiyaan sthapit karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 The announcements were fulfilled, but the darkness continued
 lalitpur ke chigaloa gaanv main sthit 1980 megawatt vidyut utpaadan kshamta vaale bajaj power plant ko mayawati sarkaar ke dauraan manjuuri mili thi
 Now it is ready
 itane dinon main plant kii utpaadan kshamta to vahi rahi, lekin laagat badhkar dedh guna ho gai
 According to the agreement reached with the Uttar Pradesh government, the Bajaj power plant was to get around Rs 10,000 crore
 kii laagat ke saath march, 2015 tak banakar taiyaar hona tha, jo ab 2016 main apni 600 megawatt kii mahaj ek ikai shuru karne kii sthiti main he
 Cost 16,000 crores
 ke paar pahunch gai he
 Recently the plant has commissioned a 600 MW unit
 lekin bada sawaal yahi he ki jo bijli yahaan banegi, vah jaaegi kahaan, kyonki transmishan line to bani hi nahin he
 Power plant officials do not answer any questions
 lalitpur power janareshan company ke upmahaprabandhak rajeev shrivastav kehete hai, ''transmishan line nahin hone ke kaaran bijli ko grid main bhejnaa mumkin nahin he
 The state government did not issue the tender in time to remove the transmission line
 iskaa plant se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The result of not having a line was that after running a unit for a few days, it was nearing closure
 taiyaar ho rahi bijli ko grid main nahin bheja ja paa rahaa tha or lalitpur ke sab stesan dedh sau se do sau megawatt se adhik bijli lene kii sthiti main nahin hai
 In the village where this power plant is, people do not have electricity even for 12 hours
 puure bundelkhand kaa kamobesh yahi haal he
 Against this, agitators led by former Union Minister of State for Rural Development Pradeep Jain surrounded the Bajaj Power Plant
 jain ne kisaanon ke haq ko lekar bada andolan karne kaa elaan bhi kiya he
 He says, "the plant which is worth Rs 10,000 crore
 main banakar taiyaar hona tha, uski laagat achaanak badhkar 16,000 karod ru
 How did you get across? There has been widespread corruption in this
 iskaa sieji audit hona chahie
 "obviously, if the cost of the plant increases, the burden on the public will increase
 jain kehete hai, ''pradesh sarkaar ke saath power plant ne vidyut niamak ayog ko jo prastaav bheja he, usamen bijli kii dar 6 ru
 Per unit, while the second thermal power plant grid has Rs 3
 unit kii dar se bijli de rahe hai
 a fight will be fought against it
 ''duusari ore, power plant ko jameen dene vaale kisaanon kaa alag hi dard he
 The farmers of Chigalaua and Mirchwara villages got compensation after acquiring about 1,600 acres of land by the power plant, but the company turned down its promise to give a job to a member of their family
 ek acre jameen kii evaj main 3
 75 lakhs
 mili the, jo kharch ho gaye
 Money went and land too
 gaanv ke ek vyakti parashuram yadav ise sarkaar dwaara vikaas ke naam par chhalaava maanate hai
 He says, "2,000 farmers from Chigalaua and Mirchwara have given their 1,600 acres of land for a power plant, but the village became desolate after the plant was built
" gaanv ke das logon ko bhi plant main rojgaar nahin mila
 They are working as laborers from Bihar and Chennai and the villagers are migrating in search of livelihood
 ''duusari ore, bundelkhand main ban rahi bijli se pradesh ke viviypi jile raushan ho rahe hai
 The Paricha Thermal Power Plant located in Jhansi generates 970 MW of power daily and is directly handed over to Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation
 isi tarah bundelkhand ke sabhi power plant sidhe grid ko bijli bhejte hai or bundelkhand ke hisse sirf do se teen sau megawatt bijli hi aati he
 This electricity is illuminating Etawah, Lucknow, Rae Bareli and Amethi
 bundelkhand ko kul 600 megawatt bijli kii aavashyaktaa he, jo akele bajaj power plant kii ek ikai se puri ho sakati he
 Hundreds of such questions are left standing and in response, the leaders and officials are sitting silently
 akhilesh yadav 20 sitambar ko plant kaa udghaatan karne pahunch rahe hai, lekin yaksha prashn to apni jagah kaayam he
 How will you reach if electricity is produced? Where else will you reach? 2000 karod thane drug haul cese main ajtak ke haath ek badi jaankaree lagi he

 lalu yadavacongress adhyaksh sonia gandhike mukhya raajnneetik salaahkaar banane ja rahe hai
 This does not mean that he will replace Ahmed Patel
 iske saath hiaap ke baagi netaonse bhi baatcheet chal rahi he - or unke jald hi congress jwine karne kii sambhaavna jataai gai he
 How did all this happen? This is the biggest question
 How did Lalu Yadav suddenly become so close? Actually, Lalu Yadav was the first leader who openly defended Sonia Gandhi on the issue of foreign origin
 baad ke dinon main bhi unhen congress pravaktaaon se bhi kahin aage bad kar sonia-rahul kii vakaalat karte dekha gaya
 These things of Lalu created a soft corner for Lalu in Sonia and Rahul's mind and the matter has reached here
 vaise bhi, rahul gandhi export salaah outsource karne ke pakshdhar rahe hai
 Also, the big problem of the Congress was that after becoming President, Pranab Mukherjee's opinion was found to be small
 aise main us jagah ko bharne ke liye congress ko aise hi ek netaa kii talash thi
 Lalu Yadav fit himself into this scale - and the thing became
 kya badaalav honge congress main?bharosemand sutron kii maane to congress kaa puraa kayakalp hone ja rahaa he
 At present, whatever is happening inside and outside the Congress is being done at the behest of Lalu on Rahul's advice
 bataate hai ki lalu kii hi salaah par bajet satr ke ain pehle rahul ne lambii chuttee par bihar jane kaa faisla kiya
 At Lalu's behest, Sonia Gandhi accompanied Congress leaders to Manmohan Singh's house - and then with opposition leaders marching to Rashtrapati Bhavan
 iske saath hi party main kai or badlaav hone ja rahe hai -raajnneetik salaahkaar parishadjis tarah satta main rahete rashtriya salaahkaar parishad kaam karti thi, badale halaat main raajnneetik salaahkaar parishad kii bhi takreeban vahi bhoomika hogi
 The special thing is that there will be no such thing as avoiding partylines
 yani duusare dalon ke netaa bhi iske sadsy ho sakate hai, basharte ve khud taiyaar hon or unke dalon ko etraj na ho
 There will be a system of giving professional reward to every member
 raajnneetik salaahkaar parishad ke chairman ke liye yogendra yadav rahul gandhi kii pehali pasand bataae ja rahe hai
 There have been many meetings between Lalu Yadav and Yogendra Yadav regarding this
 kaha to yahaan tak ja rahaa he ki kejariwal se takaraar or chitthibaji yaa phir nai party banane kii baat to upree taur par najar aa rahaa he
 All this is being done under a special strategy, on which home work has been done long back and only Lalu's mind is behind this
 aantarik lokapaub congress main bhi ek aantarik lokapal hoga taaki logon ko massej diya ja sake ki bhrashtachar ke mudde par party ke iraade kya hai? haalanki, iskaa nae sire se gathan nahin hoga balki screening cameti hi ab ek monitering body kii tarah kaam karegi
 Lalu has also approached Admiral Ramdas for this through Yogendra Yadav

 lalu yadav congress netritv ko samajha chuke hai ki raajnneeti main koi sthai dost yaa dushman to hota nahin, bas maukey kii baat hoti he
 It is said that Lalu has agreed that if both of them apologize, then they can be set in the Congress
 kaha to yahaan tak ja rahaa he ki manish sisodiya ke manaa kar dene ke baavjood lalu unhen aam aadmi party se todane ke liye prayasarat hai
 Lalu's special strategy is also being told to bring Manish's school friend Kumar Vishwas to Congress
 koun kiski jagah le saktaa he?rahul gandhi philhal to congress adhyaksh nahin banane ja rahe
 On Lalu's advice, a middle ground has been drawn
 iske tahat party samvidhan main sanshodhan kar faisle ke saare adhikaar upaadhyaksh ko de die jaaenge taaki do power centre ko lekar kaaryakarta kanfayuj na hon
 However, the chairman will have the right to veto at any time

 Similarly, Jairam Ramesh will also have to rediscover his role when Admiral Ramdas is present
 philhal congress kii sabase badi majaburi ye he ki use digvijay singh kaa riplacement nahin mil paa rahaa he
 Lalu has also raised his hand in this matter
 lalu kaa kahana he ki jarurat padane par wo anna ko bhi congress ke paksh main raji kar sakate hai, lekin digvijay ko lekar unka bhi dimag nahin chal rahaa
 Former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh says that 'I appeal to everyone to maintain peace
 lekin mujhe samaj nahin aata ki vihip ke log us jagah par jaakar prarthana kyon karte hai jahaan koi pratimaa nahin he or log vahaan namaaj adaa karte hai
 They go there only to create hindu-muslim divide in the minds of the people
