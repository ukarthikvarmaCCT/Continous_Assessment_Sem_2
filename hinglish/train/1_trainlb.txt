 kabhi na khatm hone vaali bhopal gas traasadee kii kahani main ek or nayaa mode aa gaya he
 The city of Bhopal and the entire nation, the main accused of this tragedy, Warren Anderson, who had been struggling for the last 28 years to bring back India, was the Union Home Minister of India P
 chidambaram ne hamadardi dikhaai he
 It was clear from his talk that the government was not willing to recall Anderson
 haalanki isaki vajah kuch or hi bataai gai
 Chidambaram cited his aging and illness as the main reason behind not recalling Union Carbide CEO Anderson
 unhone pichley hafte bhopal main kaha, ''anderson ab takreeban 90 varsh ke hai
 He is struggling with old age and weakness as well as many other problems
 in sthitiyon ke maddenjar yah dekha janaa he ki unhen waapas bulaane ke liye kya kiya ja saktaa he
 He is heading the group of Union ministers formed on the Bhopal gas tragedy
 unke saath kanoon mantri salmaan khurshid or kendriya carmik rajyamantri narayan sami bhi the
 The group has been formed following an order of the Supreme Court which reprimanded the Center for not safely disposing of 350 metric tons of waste in the warehouse of the Union Carbide Factory even 28 years after the world's most dangerous gas tragedy
 Has been imposed
 supreme court ne kaha, ''is bare main 28 saal baad bhi faisla nahin ho paaya kyonki samasya se prabhavit log garib hai
 This is the government's failure to deal with the problem
 '' gas haadase ke baad 20,000 metric ton kachra do talabon or 17 anya sthanon par jameen ke neeche dabaa diya gaya tha, jiske kaaran teen kimi ke kshetra main log ab bhi dooshit pani pi rahe hai
 The Bhopal gas tragedy killed 3,800 people and injured about 10,000 people
 us vakt anderson ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha or us jahrili gas ke li hone kii ghatana ke mahaj chaar din baad yani 7 disambar, 1984 ko jamaanat par reeha bhi kar diya gaya
 On the same day, he left for Bhopal from the Madhya Pradesh government plane and left for America and never came to India after that to appear in any trial
 1993 main jila nyaayalay ne anderson ko aapraadhik maamle kaa doshi paaya
 Then in 2001, CBI filed a chargesheet in the Delhi court to prosecute Anderson again
 sibiai ne kaha ki anderson ko plant ke kamjor suraksha upayon ke bare main jaankaree thi or uske paas is sambandh main nae pukhta pramaan hai
 Anderson was also cautioned in this regard
 suraksha ke prati barti laaparvaahee kaa hi nateeja thi 2-3 disambar, 1984 kii raat
 But the Center's wavering attitude, unwillingness and carelessness to call Anderson to India have crushed the hopes of gas victims, who have been seeking justice for 28 years
 bhopal gas peedit mahila udyog sanghathan ke sanyojak abdul jabbaar kehete hai, ''pehle din se hi sarkaar daau chemicals ke prati naram he or ab budhaape or beemaari ke bahaane anderson ke prati bhi narmi dikhaa rahi he

 Priyanka along with her mother Sonia Gandhi reached Khan market around 11 am and tasted the food in the restaurant

 In fact, the Congress wanted to create a grand alliance on the lines of Bihar to stop the BJP in UP as well
 bihar main yah siyaasi sameekaran kaaphi safal rahaa tha, lekin upi main isaki raah main rode aan pade
 Even seeing the dream of riding a bicycle, Akhilesh was shown cheating by the Congress
 congress ke tamaam manze hue khilaadi bhi akhilesh ke is daanv ke aage chit ho gaye the
 Then Priyanka took command and took the front in her hand and managed to get the politically cold Congress to get an alliance with SP
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki party ko is lihaaf kii garmaahat milte hi priyanka or sonia dilli main mausam kii garmaahat kaa lutf lene nikal padin
 Now, how much heat will the Congress receive in this sunlight, for that we will have to wait for the results

 With his first collection, he created in the contemporary landscape of the story the image of a young storyteller who tells an authentic picture of a changing village every day in his stories
 doosraa sangrah is chhavi ko pusht karata he kyonki in kahaniyon main unke sarokaar adhik pukhta hue hai
 He has been trying to become an achievement, not a story writing practice
 gyaarah kahaniyon kaa yah sangrah bhumandalikaran ke dinon main bhartiya gaanv kaa rochak or bhitari chitra prastut karata he
 These stories are compositions targeting the changes in caste-varna, corruption and social relations prevailing in the villages

 His narrative presentation is the basic concept of Pathik's stories
 daliton ke saath ho rahe anyaay apmaan kaa bodh karaate hue ve chaowkee jaisi kahani likhte hai to meena-gurjar samudaayon ke aapasi sangharsh par muchhen jaisi badhiya kahani bhi
 Concerns were sometimes raised about Muslim characters being omitted from stories
 pathik kii kahaniyon main muslim paatro kii awajahi itane saamaanya namaaloom dhang se hui he ki lagata nahin ki ye paatr kahaan the
 Instead of forging the story, they make an account of it by keeping the surroundings-events in the midst of such a comprehensive truth

 The Dalits are not Dalits and they do not even see their consent to identity discourse
 kalua ek dalit stri kii kahani he jo asmitai vimarsh kii seemaa bataati he
 The incidents of Dalit oppression in the villages have often come in the composition world
 yahaan dalit stri ek anokhaa kaam karti haih apni bhens ke nar shishu ko padha banaati he taaki gaanv kii bhainson ke garbhaadhan ke liye dabangon kii khushaamad na kerani pade

 The biggest enemy of the police is terrorism and there are different ways to deal with terrorism
 bollywood main in tareekon ko filmi parde par ukerne ke kai prayaas kiye gaye
 After best films like 'A Wednesday' and 'special 26', director Neeraj Pandey has also done a unique effort in this direction and named 'baby'
 yah film desh ke jambaajon kii kahani he
 It has a secret mission
 ection he
 The terrorists have a passion
 nafrat or napak sajeesh he
 There are heavy dialogues, and there are laughter in between
 kahani:film main akshay kumaar aties (anti tebrist skhwaid) ke ek jaanbaaj sipaahi bane hai, jo danni ke under main kaam karte hai
 They are soldiers who, despite having a wife and two children at home, are ready 24x7 for any mission

 Then in the last, three officers Akshay Kumar, Rana Daggubatti and Anupam Kher are chosen for a mission

 The name of this mission is 'baby'

 Whether it is KK Menon or Bilal in the negative role, it seems that no one could do it better than him

 Whatever happens on the screen, everyone is connected to each other from beginning to end
 agent ke rup main taapasi pannu ne bhi behtareen abhinay kiya he
 Why not watch: There are some episodes in the film that you might find irrational
 lekin aksar aisi filmon main kadiyaan mahatvapurn ho jaati hai
 The film is 2 hours 39 minutes and Neeraj has left no chance to tie the audience to the chair
 hamaara samaaj digital hua he or bharat main iskaa aisa asar isse pehle kabhi nahin dekha gaya
 This is the reason that today there have been significant changes in both the nature and number of job opportunities in the field of research and development
 research or deveopment maujuuda har technology kii ridh hai, isliye hamen behatar or zyada sahaj solution paane ke liye lagaataar nae badlaav karne or ashaavadi rahane kii jarurat he
 Today we have adopted new technology
 isliye nai technology se sidhe jude hone kii vajah se research or deveopment speshlijeshans apane aap ubhar rahe hai
 For example, it is now necessary for research and development specialists to find new ways to make this platform energy efficient as well as high-speed performer
 desh kii badhati jansankhya or urja kii kami kii vajah se bhi yah jaruri he
 Therefore, low power electronics design and high speed performance engineering is emerging in research and development
 isi tarah mobile phone ab sirf connactivity kaa saadhan bhar nahin he balki soochna kaa strot or bijness sansaadhan bhi ban gaya he
 Researchers are now looking for ways to put all these functions into this small device that can be kept in hand
 iske alaava chip kaa system, veriphication technology, flash storage medium, software research or hardware tathaa software dizin jaise kshetra bhi viksit ho rahe hai
 The capabilities of these research specialties are yet to be fully explored, so this field is catching the attention of the whole world
 research or deveopment ke kshetra main pravesh or safalataa ke liye do visheshtaayen honi jaruri hai
 The first is that your fundamental should be completely clear
 yah bahut hi chunauteepurn kshetra he jiske kai pahaluon main samay ke saath lagaataar badlaav ho rahe hai
 Researchers must have excellent knowledge to keep pace, especially in terms of basics
 isliye skool-college ke dinon main hi apana fundamental viksit karnaa aapke liye bahut jaruri he
 This will benefit in the long run
 duusari cheez yah he ki aapako nai chijen seekhney ke liye hameshaa taiyaar rahanaa hoga kyonki research ke rup main aap nae skill yaa soochnaaon ko apnaane kii ore aankh nahin moond sakate
 It is very important to be constantly updated with the latest trends
 workaplace par anubhav hasil karne ke maukey hote hai lekin yaad rakhana chahie ki grajuation khatm hone ke saath hi seekhney kii prakriya khatm nahin ho jaati
 There is a need for hard work and commitment in the field of research and development but in reality it is an exciting sector
 khaskar ity or technology ke kshetra main
 Today more and more people are adopting new technology, so in the coming years, this sector will also grow significantly and expand

 For this post, he demanded a 'secular and liberal face'

 There have been speculations that the third front may get a seat in 2014
 aisa hua to desh ke itihaas main teesri baar gaiyr-congressi, gaiyr-bijepi gathbandhan satta main aayega
 Many people believe that the Third Front is Khyali Pulao, which is making more jumps in the minds of regional parties than the land
 lekin kshetreey dalon ke kai netaa maanate hai ki ‘‘ab iskaa samay aa gaya he
 The BJP rejects this outright
 rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali kehete hai, ‘‘itihaas gavaah he ki teesraa morcha naakaam prayog he
 Yet leaders like Mulayam Singh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party (SP) are confident that their time has come
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘agali sarkaar kshetreey dal banaaenge
 "BJP has its own reason behind rejecting the Third Front, in its view this front will do the work of" sharing of votes "

 There are about 150 mps in the Lok Sabha from states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala, but bjp's presence in them is only a fraction

 If Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are included in these states, the SP, TMC, BJD, AIADMK, TDP and YSR Congress, the possible constituents of the Third Front, are expected to get most seats

 At present, there is no consensus on which of the two national parties will join the Third Front
 sapa, argedy, jedy (you), viesar congress or tiemasi ko apane-apane rajyon main muslim vot bank thame rakhana he, isliye bijepi kaa haath pakadaaey kii sambhaavna kam he
 If BJP leader becomes Modi then there will be fear of losing Muslim votes
 jayalalita or naveen patnayak jaise netaaon ko aisa koi dar nahin he
 lalu-nitish: Under the circumstances of the alliance, Lalu Prasad would prefer the Third Front government or the government under the leadership of the Congress with the external support of the Congress

 isse centre main lalu kaa rajnatik dabadabaa kam ho gaya tha
 Lalu does not get tired of reminding that he and his party never took bjp's hand
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘hamaara record gavaah he ki hamane sampradayik takaton (yani bijepi) se kabhi naata nahin joda
 "lalu's priority at the moment is that the Congress should not side with the JD (U) under any circumstances

 His political managers believe that the Congress may be the best partner for the JD (U) in the near future
 iske kai kaaran hai
 For one, Nitish needs Congress to get special status for Bihar
 duusare ve yah bhi chaahate hai ki party unka saath de taaki muslim vot lalu kii bajaae unke gathjod ko milen

 Yes, Amarendra Bahubali in the film has shown to be a wonderful husband for Devasena
 jis tarah wo devsena se behad pyaar karata dikhaa, wo kabeeley tarif he
 Nowadays it is very difficult to find such a husband, but there is no guard over wishes
 aaie jaanate hai aakhir kyon he amarendra bahubali ek idal pati:‘mammaj boy’ ke saath-saath patni ke bhi chahetefilm main amarendra ko wo dialog to aapako yaad hoga, 'devsena ko kisi ne haath bhi lagaaya to samajho bahubali kii talwaar ko haath laga diya'
 After this dialogue of Bahubali, there was no stopping the girls' applause and seats in the theater
 ji haa, har ladki kii chahat hoti he kii uskaa pati hameshaa uski aisi hi care kare
 Boys of ordinary nature are happy, in the girls' film, Amarendra initially did not reveal the identity of his' king 'to Devasena but won his heart like an ordinary boy
 darasal asal jindagi main bhi ladakiyon ke aise ladke bahut bhaate hai jo kii swabhaav se saadhaaran hote hai bajaay unke jo dikhaava zyada karte hai

 But Bahubali explained to them that the relative hugs do not bow their head
 usee tarah har ladki ko acha lagata he agar uskaa pati uske maa-baap ko apane maa-baap kii tarah samajhe or unki izzat kare
 You always remember that beautiful scene of the film with your wife, then you will surely remember when Devasena falls into the water and sits on the shoulder of Bahubali and sits back in the boat
 aajkal kii ladkiyaan aise hi pati kii khwaahish rakhti hai, jo zarurat padane par unke liye hameshaa maujuud ho
 Which was the best scene of this film, above all, the honor of wife? When Devasena bites the fingers of the man who tries to touch him and then Bahubali comes and cuts him into two pieces
 aapako kisi ko maarane kii zarurat nahin
 But yes, your wife will like it if you care about them and take the person teasing them to jail

 kanoon kaa nirmaan logon kii suraksha or adhikaron kii raksha ke liye hota he
 But what happens when the same law is being levied on human relationships and sensibilities
 khaskar tab jab nishane par vah ho jisaki umr mahaj 10 din he
 It will be called a tragedy of the rules that a woman who came to India from Pakistan just two months ago, is stuck in legal trouble to return to her homeland
 mahila kaa 'dosha' sirf itnaa he ki usne jaisalmer main apane jigar ke tukade ko janm diya he
 Actually, the practice of child birth and return to the country is entangled in the rules
 jaisalmer main janme bachche ko ab uski maa ke saath pakistan jane nahin diya ja rahaa he, kyonki 10 din ke is bachche kaa naa to vija he or naa hi passport
 Whereas this child born in India of Pakistani couple will be called Pakistani as per rules
 shuukravaar raat thar express se ravaanaa hue danpati ke bachche ko shanivaar ko munaabaav main roak kar vaapis lautaa diya gaya he
 According to the immigration officials posted in Munabav, the couple will have to leave their 10-day-old child in India and go to Pakistan based on the rules
 pakistani danpati ravivaar ko jodhpur pahunche or phir pakistani duutavas ke adhikari bachche ke vija-passport ke liye nai dilli ravaanaa ho gaye
 What and how is the matter entangled Rasid Khan, a resident of Basnapir, Jaisalmer, told that in a close relationship, her husband Miri Fatima (35), her husband Mir Mohammad Lahar, who is a resident of Ghotki, Pakistan, came to Jaisalmer from Munabav Marg on 22 February
 uske pita kaa dehanth hone par vah apni maa se milane ai thi
 Although his visa was only for one and a half months, he was later extended
 asal main fatima jab bharat ai thi tab vah garbhvatee thi
 On 14 April she gave birth to a son in a private hospital in Jaisalmer
 aspataal ke record main sthaneey nagar parishad dwaara sohail khan putr mir mohammad va fatima ke naam se berth certificate bhi jari kiya gaya
 The couple's family left for Pakistan by the Thar Express on Friday, but on Saturday they were barred from traveling to Pakistan with their newborn
 vahaan tainaat abjan adhikariyon ne unhen bataaya gaya ki bachche ke paas kisi prakaar kaa vija passport nahi hai isliye ve use pakistan nahin le ja sakate
 Now what can happen? According to the rules, if the couple has to go to Pakistan, then they will have to leave the child, because the child does not have a visa or passport
 lekin samasya yah he ki danpati 10 din ke navjaat ko bharat main kiske bharose chhod kar jaae
 Rashid Khan told that when Fatima came to India, she was 7 months pregnant
 duusari ore, nagar parishad ke aadhikarik sutron ne danpati ke bharat main janme bachche sohail khan ke naam berth certificate jari karne kii pushti kii he
 Officials said that the hospital has issued a birth certificate on serial number 1352, dated 21 April 2014, based on the record and a copy of the visa passport
 danpati kaa vija 6 may ko samaapt ho rahaa he

 # nehakakkar a post shared by Neha Kakkar (@nehakakkar) on Feb 19, 2017 at 3:53am PST Describing Yuvraj Singh as a brilliant all-round bowler in the Twenty20 league after the World Cup, former leg-spinner and national selector Narendra Hirwani has said that his bowling will improve over time
 vishwa cap main 362 ran banane ke saath apni dhimi gendbaaji se 15 wicket lene vaale yuvaraj player of da toornament bane the
 While retaining the same form in the fourth season of the Twenty20 League, he took four wickets for 29 runs against Delhi yesterday, though his team had to face defeat
 yuvaraj ne vishwa cap ke baad puraskaar lete samay apni gendbaaji main aaye panepan kaa shrey hirwani ko diya tha
 When asked about this, Hirwani said, 'yuvraj is a very good bowler
 yadi vah or tavajjo de to niyamit gendbaaj ban saktaa he
 Everyone has seen the change in him and with time and experience his bowling will improve further
 ’yah poochne par ki yuvaraj ne is bare main unase kab tips lee thi to hirwani ne kaha, ‘ham donon air india main he lihaaja sampark hota rahata he
 i saw him bowling on the net and i asked him for advice if he asked for some suggestions
 ’westeindies ke khilaaf 1988 main apane pehle hi test main 16 wicket lekar sansani failaane vaale hirwani ne kaha, ‘maine yuvaraj ko gendbaaji ke maansik pahalu ke bare main suzav diye the
 i told him that positive thinking is very important in bowling
 ’unhone kaha, ‘maine usase kaha tha ki har gend phenkane se pehle yah akalan kare ki vah kahaan or kaise padegi
 According to every batsman, it is necessary to bring some diversity in it
 usne meri salaah par dhyaan diya or sabase jaruri baat ki maidan par amal kiya
 'yuvraj, who has scored more than 8000 runs in 272 odis, has also taken 105 wickets in his career

 In the politics of Maharashtra, according to me, there can be no debate that after 1995, the Bharatiya Janata Party has given historical results in the 2014 elections
 lekin purna bahumat nahin mil paane kii vajah se yahi nattejey ab bijepi par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 First breaking the relationship with Shiv Sena in a dramatic manner at the last moment and then making its Chief Minister with the agreement with the Badger Shiv Sena and creating confusion in Uddhav Thackeray
 kya shivasena aakhirkaar bijepi ke saath aegi yaa nahin ye sena or bijepi kii samasya he? But there is a bigger problem than this, what will happen to a state like Maharashtra? In recent years, the debt of Maharashtra has crossed 2 lakh 70 thousand crores
 aise main ek ahm sawaal yah he ki ek alpamat kii sarkaar ko chalaate hue kya−kya kade faisale devendra fadanvis le paaenge or kya fadanvis alag−alag dabaavon ke saamne nahin jhuk jaaenge? Even though his image is said to be that of an honest leader, this is the biggest challenge in Maharashtra
 bhaashanbaazi or bayaanbazi, sab apni jagah thik hai, lekin maharashtra main system ke bhrashtachar kaa lanbaa itihaas rahaa he
 So will a minority Chief Minister be able to change this history and if there is an agreement between the Shiv Sena and the BJP with its own terms, will the BJP be able to extend its existence further? siyaasi taur par ye baat saafe he ki shivasena ho yaa koi or party vah bijepi ko koi aisa mauka dena nahin chaahegi ki vah apni takat maharashtra main badha sake or bijepi kaa sirf yahi agenda he, kyonki uski soch or sapana donon yahi tha ki maharashtra main bager kisi ke saath aae uski sarkaar jisase vah ek kadam peeche rah gai

 desh ko india kii jagah bharat kahe jane or pahachaane jane kii maang ko lekar supreme court ne tippanee kii ki janhit ke naam par aisi yachikaayen court main nahin aani chahie
 It is an emotional matter
 court ne is janhit yachika ko khaarij kar diya he
 The court said that people should not come to court by taking the name of public interest litigation in such emotional cases
 yah logon kii bhaawanaaon par nirbhar karata he ki vah apane desh ko kis naam se pukarana chaahate hai, jo log india naam pasand karte hai vah desh ko india naam se pukaaren or jo log bharat naam pasand karte hai, vah desh ko bharat naam se pukaaren
 For this the court and the law cannot direct and bind anyone

 hamaare desh kaa asli naam raja bharat ke naam par bharat rakhaa gaya tha
 But currently the name has lost its international recognition
 is naam se hamaare desh kaa gaurav or itihaas judaa he, isliye centre sarkaar ko nirdesh jari kiya jaae ki vah desh ko india kii jagah bharat naam se har jagah sambodhit karen
 The court has rejected this PIL
 court ne kaha ki is tarah ke bhaavnaatmak maamalon ko janhit yachika kaa naam lekar logon ko court main nahin aana chahie
 It depends on the feelings of the people, by which name they want to call their country, those who like the name India, call the country as India and those who like the name Bharat, they call the country as India

 It looks like some fraud, but it is not so
 kuch-kuch aisa hi he dilli ke band menhoopoj kaa kissa
 Menopause is special for several reasons
 ek to yah takreeban 18 saal se kaayam he
 It was 2000 when Randeep Singh, the band's future bass player, approached him during a performance of the band at Dilli Haat
 tab band ke pramukh gayak or ab pita ban chuke car radiator samrajya ke diggaj sarbajit chaddha reria rahe the
 Like the city they sing songs about, this band is also a consignment of survivors
 in tamaam logon ke bich menhoopoj ne jindagi ko bade najadik se dekha heru bypolar disorder, sharaab kii lat, cancer or parkingsanse
 Many members of the band chose their own paths but the big project by Menhoeppos never stopped
 dilli main vaikalpik rock sangeet ke liye jagah simatati ja rahi he
 But the band has not let it discourage itself
 aakhir bharat ek vishaal desh he, lihaaja menhoopoj ne desh ke is bhugol ko hi apni sampada main tabdeel kar liya he
 Last month, when India Today spoke to him on the phone, he was wandering in the jungles of Arunachal Pradesh
 ve saijosa naam kii kisi jagah kii talash kar he the, jahaan koi pradarshan karne ke liye unhone qaraar kiya hua tha
 What a funny irony too
 dilli kaa ek band dilli ke bare main album taiyaar karata he or phir dilli kii mukhyadhara ko bhaad main jane ke liye bolkar vahaan kii jagah apana sangeet sudur purvottar main le jaataa he
 Her main character is Delhi in the 2017 album Neon Delhi

 jab bhi aap dilli aate hai to aapako drilling mashin kii aawaaj sunai detii he
 You cannot escape from this
 yah aapke dimag main chhed karti rahati he
 Kutty and Randeep are aware of all these changes
 unhone hauj khaas gaanv main da tody shop naam se ek kaamyaab restaraan or baar chalaaya jo kuch samay ke liye dilli main kalakaaron kaa adda ban gaya tha
 His thoughts about the "capital's excesses" can be seen in his video single "on the Boat", which has been shot by Prita Vihar's Hindi rapper Phadu
 yah single hindi-angreji kii mili-juli aulad tha
 The music video features the band's current manager Sahaj Bhatia, who spent one night in jail for throwing a glass of water on an accused Congress leader in rioting cases against Sikhs
 nion dilli ek dhime-dhime pakane vaala album he-kalatmak, prayogvaadi or ajeebogareeb
 It is believed that good albums slowly slow down on you
 pehali baar sunne main hi jo behad joardaar lagane lag jaae use lekar thodaa sashankit ho hi janaa chahie
 When the band introduced these new songs to an audience in Delhi's Hard Rock Cafe, the effect was as if a band was tampering with the rest of their unhappy instruments
 lekin pehla prabhaav bhraamak bhi ho saktaa he
 Neon Delhi is a headphone album and every song has been crafted with great workmanship
 kai paraton vaali jigso paheli kii tarah jo badi nafasat ke saath sulajhati chali jaati he

 "the bench said," the High Court had said that Babur had independent rights and had done something which cannot be reviewed
 ucch nyaayalay ne kaha tha ki ham is sawaal ko nahin dekh sakate ki babar ne jo kiya tha, vah 'sharia' ke khilaaf tha
 "the bench said that instead of talking about the alleged violation of Islamic laws and traditions, the High Court said that it would look into the aspect that people consider it a mosque
 peeth main nyaayamurti es e bobade, nyaayamurti di vaai chandrachud, nyaayamurti ashok bhushan or nyaayamurti es e nazeer bhi hai

 Due to misuse, a person has to fail and there is a problem in stability
 parantu agar kundali main majboot rajyog ho to, ek hi rajyog yaa shubh yoga se kundali ke duryog nasht ho jate hai
 Shani controls karma and its fruits, hence Shani's role in human life becomes important
 chunki shani kaa fal dene par aadhipaty he isliye iske rajyog or duryog sabase zyada prabhaavshaalee hote hai
 What are the illusions formed by Saturn and what is their effect? - Saturn sitting in the horoscope giving physical pleasure is a form of misuse that causes problems
 - shani kaa neech raashi main paaya janaa bhi samasya kaa bada kaaran banataa he
 - When Saturn is related to Rahu or Mars, there is a severe misuse of the accident
 - shani kaa surya se sambandh hone par sarp yoga banataa he jo pita-putr ke liye ghaatak duryog he
 - When Saturn is related to Scorpio or Moon, there is Visha Yoga which leads a person to restlessness and failures

 - If Saturn is in the higher zodiac or the original triangle zodiac, then Panchama Purusha Yoga called "shash" is formed
 - shani agar brihaspati kii raashi main ho to bhi vyakti apaar naam-yash arjeet karata he
 - Saturn combines Jupiter and Venus with the addition of "anshvatar", which makes a person divine
 - bina shani kii krupa ke koi bhi bada aadhyatmik yoga prabhavi nahin hota
 On 5 days, women will be disturbed by the shadow of Rahu and Saturn on Venus, do simple and infallible ways to strengthen the Raja Yoga of Remediation and destroy the illusions - every Saturday either keep a Vela fast or take a satvik diet
 - saayam kaal pipal ke vriksh main jal daalen , vahiin par sarson tel kaa deepak jalaae or vriksh kii parikrama karen

 He says that after the results of the Lok Sabha elections, he will be ready to give the President a letter of support from the opposition parties for the formation of an alternative government
 sutron ne kaha ki is asaamaanya kadam kaa kaaran yah sunishchit karnaa he taaki raashtrapati chunaav main sabase badi party ke rup main ubhari kisi party ko (single larguest party) ko kshetreey dalon or gathbandhan ko todane yaa todane kaa prayaas karne kaa mauka na den
 This step is to prevent regional parties from erupting
 bataa den ki loksabhaa main 543 nirvaachit sadsy hote hai, jinamein bahumat ke liye 274 saansadon kii jarurat hoti he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won a majority with 282 seats
 vahiin, NDA kii sanyukt takat loksabhaa main 336 siten thim
 In 1998, President KR Narayan asked Atal Bihari Vajpayee to present a letter of support before forming the government and getting a vote of confidence in the House
 us vakt bijepi ne 178 siten jeetin thim or gathbandhan ke paas 252 sadsy the
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government was somehow formed with external support, but after 20 months the government fell, when it lost the vote of confidence by one vote

 The BJP protested in Karnataka when the Congress aligned with HD Kumaraswamy's Janata Dal Secular after the election
 antim samay tak rajya bhaajapa pramukh bies yediurppa ne jor dekar kaha tha ki unki party ko sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit kiya janaa chahie or yah vidhansabha ke farsh par bahumat sabit karegi
 But the initiative was later stopped by BJP amid allegations of horse-trading
 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye jabaki koi aupchaarik gathbandhan nahin hua he, baavjood iske 21 partiyaan bijepi se muqabla karne ke liye rashtriya str par ek saath hai
 Apart from this, there are also signs of formation of non-bjp and non-congress Third Front

 Let us know that the last phase of Lok Sabha elections will be voted on May 19 and the votes will be counted on May 23

 See if there is talk of changing the uniforms of our security personnel, then we will definitely do this

 If you are convinced that even if your husband smokes cigarettes, but your child does not have this bad addiction and he is suffering, then you are wrong

 According to one study, children of parents who smoke cigarettes tend to have wider waistlines than children of their age
 10 saal kaa hote-hote unamem iske lakshan dikhaai dene lagate hai
 Not only this, the body mass index (BMI) of such children is also very high

 The lead author of the study and Principal Linda Pagani of the Canadian University of Canada says, "between the children of children who smoke, the waist becomes wider than other children of the same age when they are 10 years old

 Three trials have been conducted so far by the opposition parties to stop the 'vijay Rath' of the Narendra Modi-led BJP
 vipaksh ko in teenon trial formule se bijepi ko maat or vipaksh ko jeet kaa mantra mila
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections against the BJP, if the opposition enters the election summer by forming a grand alliance on the same formula, it will be difficult for Modi to retain power
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi 'modi lahar' par savaar hokar centre kii satta par kabiz hui thi
 As a result, the Congress was wiped out of the country and satraps from the states
 upi main basapa or areldi jiro par simat gai jabaki sapa apane kunbe tak
 At the same time, RJD and JDU could not touch the double figures in Bihar
 iske alaava haryana main ieneldi mahaj do seat hi jeet saki thi
 However, in regional parties, only Mamta Banerjee, Naveen Patnaik and Jayalalithaa could save their fort
 isi kaa nateeja he ki modi ke khilaaf vipakshi dal ekajute hokar apana khoyaa hua vajood paanaa chaahate hai

 In 2015, when the three parties contested the assembly elections by forming a grand alliance, the BJP was upset
 vipaksh ko pehali baar modi ko haraane kaa formula mila
 However, Nitish Kumar later broke away from the Grand Alliance and joined hands with the BJP and is running the government
 2
 The bsp's support to the SP in UP had completely eliminated the opposition parties including SP, BSP, RLD, riding on the BJP Modi chariot in the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly elections
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki gorakhpur or phulpur upachunaav main basapa ne sapa ko samarthan kiya
 As a result, CM and Deputy CM could not save their seats
 iske baad kairana main areldi ko sapa, basapa, congress sahit samooche vipaksh kaa saath mila, to bijepi ko yahaan bhi haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa

 karnataka main congress-jedies gathbandhankarnataka vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke khilaaf congress or jedies alag hokar chunavi maidan main utre the
 No party got a majority if the election results came
 haalanki bijepi 104 siton ke saath sabase badi party thi lekin bahumat se mahaj 7 siten dur thi
 In such a situation, Congress joined hands with JDS to prevent BJP from coming to power
 congress duusare number kii party hote hue bhi tisare number kii jedies ko satta kii kursi saunp di
 The result of this was that the BJP was deprived of forming the government

 desh kii rajdhani dilli ke karol baag main 108 foot oonche hanuman mandir ke avaidh nirmaan ko lekar dilli hoicourt ne sibiai ko har maheene apni jaanch kii states report court ko dene ke liye kaha he
 In this case, the court has also appointed its own lawyers, who will tell the court on every date how seriously the investigation is going on
 maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne kaha ki dharm or aadhyatm se jude maamalon main aapraadhik gatividhiyon kii ijaajat nahin di ja sakati
 The court said that the Land Onig Agency is not keen on taking back the land where the temple is built
 bataa den ki pichley kaaphi vakt se dilli hoicourt us janhit yachika par sunwaayee kar rahaa he jisamen kaha gaya he ki karol baag or uske aasapaas ke ilaake main atikaraman kii vajah se trephic jam kii samasya bani hui he

 Last year, the Delhi High Court transferred the entire case to the CBI for investigation
 uske baad se sibiai is maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The court made it clear in the hearing that whether there are people associated with the administration of Hanuman temple or government officials, but strict action should be taken against those who made illegal construction or were allowed to build it
 court ne kaha ki yah behad ascharyajanak or durbhagyapurna he ki sarkari jameen par ek aise mandir ko bina ijaajat ke taiyaar kiya gaya jisase naa sirf trephic jam kii samasya bad rahi he balki jiske nirmaan ke badasarkari jameenka istemaal karke mandir prashasan har roj lakhon rupee kaa chanda le rahaa he
 The next hearing of the case will be held in September
 is dauraan sibiai ko apni states report court ko saunpny hogi
 The 13-year-old Mahant Kanhaiya of the temple was engaged in preparing the idol, it was told that it took 13 years to prepare the Hanuman idol
 mahant ke mutabik 1994 se 2007 ke bich jabamurti ko banayagaya, tab aasapaas jangal tha
 At that time there was no project to build the road
 mahant kaa kahana he ki court or sarkaar ko apane faisle par dobaaraa vichaar karnaa chahie, kyonki hanuman kii murti sirf ek mandir nahin balki dilli or desh kii pahchaan he
 The media has clarified the news of making Aadhaar mandatory for mid-day meal and giving cash money instead of providing cooked food to children up to 6 years old
 kendra sarkaar ne kaha he ki uski koshish bacchon or mahilaon ke liye chal rahi skim se bhrashtachar khatm karne kii he
 The Ministry of Women and Child Welfare said in a clean manner that there is no preparation to provide cash to children up to 6 years of age in Mid Day Meal Scheme
 mantralay kii safai ke mutabik:1
 Supplementary nutrition is provided for children aged 6–36 months and pregnant women and children under the ICDS scheme
 is rashan ko ghar le jane kaa anumati rahati he
 But for 3-6 year olds, cooked food is served at the Anganwadi Center
 bacchon ke liye pakaa hua khaanaa anganwari centre par uplabdh rahegaa or ise cash transfar se badalane kii koi yojana nahin he
 2
 ghar le jane ke liesppalimentry neutrishan kii gunvatttapar sawaal uthaa he
 Therefore, the Central Government is working on ways to improve the distribution system and make them more transparent
 iske liye kendra sarkaar sappalimentry neutrishan ke evaj main bataur pailet program kuch jilon main cash dene kii yojana par kaam kar rahi he
 Decision has not yet been taken to implement it nationwide

 There is a provision for notifying Supplementary Nutrition Rules under section 39 of the National Food Security Act 2013
 yah niyam pehali baar 8
 6
 2015 ko notiphoi kiya gaya
 At the same time, under Section 8 of the National Food Security Act, there is a provision of food security allowance in the event of non-availability of food items
 is niyam ko 20
 02
 2017 ko notiphoi kiya gaya
 Therefore, this allowance has nothing to do with the distribution of food items under supplementary nutrition
 sarkari skiimon ke liye jaruri ho rahaa aadhardesh main 112 karod logon kaa aadhaar card ban chukaa he
 More than 40 crore people have added Aadhaar to their bank accounts
 aadhaar nabanr se kisi kii pahchaan sthapit karne kaa system bhi taiyaar kiya ja chukaa he
 Now, the central government's exercise is to benefit all government schemes under direct benefit transfer to these 112 crore people by using this Aadhar card
 lihaaja desh kii 125 karod jansankhya main abhi bhi 13 karod se adhik aise log hai jinka aadhaar card nahin bana he or sarkari skiimon kaa phayda lene ke liye unhen 30 june tak apana aadhaar banavaa lenaa hoga
 Therefore it has become necessary that according to the provision given in section 7 of the Aadhaar Aadhar Act, if the Central Government provides any service or subsidy from the accumulated fund, then it can have the obligation of Aadhaar
 haalanki act ke mutabik yadi kisi vyakti ke paas aadhaar nahin he jo use turant aadhaar ke liye aavedan karnaa hoga or jabatak use aadhaar number nahin mil jaataa sarkaar ko use anya madhyamon se seva athwa sabsidi kaa laabh dena hoga
 Therefore, it is at your discretion to get Aadhaar but it is mandatory to get it to take advantage of government schemes

 arthvyavastha ko lekar yashavanth sinha ke bayaan par raajnneeti tej ho gai he
 Actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha had justified Sinha's statement in the BJP itself
 Now bjp's MP Kirti Azad has come down in defense of Yashwant Sinha
 kirti aaazaad se 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet main kaha he ki unhone sinha kaa lekh padhaa us lekhan bahut sari gambhir baaten thi
 He said that the next day Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, instead of answering questions, imposed personal attacks on Sinha, which was not expected
 kirti aaazaad ne kaha ki agar arthvyavastha main dhimi he or is tarah kaa koi aarope lagata he to aisi paristhiti main aap apeksha rakhte hai ki jo desh ke vitt mantri hainvah gambhirtha se uskaa javaabdhenge
 But the Finance Minister said that Sinha is looking for a job at the age of 80, did not respond to the things asked of him and distracted him from the issue
 arthvyavastha or jetali par par sawaal uthaate hue aaazaad ne kaha ki aap chale gaye itihaas main, itihaas ko chhodie, 40 maheene kaa samay biit chukaa he, logon ke bich main haahaakaar machaa he
 He said that when we also go to our areas, people ask questions, repeatedly ask questions about GST and demonetisation
 kirti ne kaha ki ham yah chaahate hai ki kam se kam logon ko vitt mantri aa kar samajhaayen
 Explain and explain to the people that if drastic steps have been taken, how will they be cured or their problems will be eradicated
 chanakya kaa hawala dete hue aaazaad ne kaha ki phool par jab bhunra baithta he to is prakaar se usamen se ras chus letaa he ki phool ko pataa naa chale
 In the same way, if you also impose tax, then at least the common people should not feel the pain
 maan lijie ham khilaaf hai
 We are taking the opportunity to attack
 lekin jo vyavastha jo sthiti vyapaariyon kii, aam aadmi kii he us kii vyathaa ko to dur kiijie
 He said that let's say we are rebel, believe Yashwant Sinha is a rebel, as if the other people who speak in protest are rebels
 lekin kya sakaaratmak aalochana bhi baagi hona hota he?karti aaazaad ne kaha ki aadmi kya sakaaratmak aalochana nahin kar saktaa he, kya paristhitiyon ko dekhakar agar pehle abhas karaata he to kya vah baagi ho gaya
 i did not understand this thing till today
 loktantr he or loktantr main koi bole to vah baagi kaise ho gaya
 i have nothing to do with what happened to Yashwant Sinha
 meraa prashn keval yah he ki unhone jo lekh likhaa tha uske upar jawaab binduvaar dena chahie tha jo nahin diya gaya
 Cricketer-turned-politician Kirti said that the suspicion i had in my mind by not answering changed into the belief that the economy is really bad
 anyathaa jo arun jetali ne agle dinanaukariyaan dhundne vaala javabodia usase sinha ke lekh kaa majaak bana diya gaya
 He said that Yashwant Sinha has also been a good economist, finance minister and in his reply when it is not right to speak in this way
 jetali par tanj kasate hue aaazaad ne kaha ki vah kabhi lok sabha chunaav nahin jite, to samajha ja saktaa he ki jetali aam janata ke dukh dard ko nahin samaj sakate
 i can understand this and give them the benefit that you will not understand because you have never won an election and they did not get a chance to sit among the common man
 mubani main bahari logon vaale bayaan par kirti ne raaj thakare ko bhi nishane par liya
 He said that Raj Thackeray himself is from Bihar, if you have read the book of Balasaheb Thackeray, then he has written in his book that my ancestors came from Bihar itself
 vah kya gaaliyaan detaa he sabase pehle us ko markar nikaalnaa chahie uske baad kisi or ke bare main sochna chahie

 The rest of the children were getting ready to go to school and those two girls were preparing for the journey of Jannat
 unhen unke hi maa-baap ne samajhaayaa tha ki kaise unhen jananath milegi
 Even children aged 8-9 years are not spared Baghdadi
 jehad or jananath ke naam par wo unhen barood se bharaa bastaa sirf isliye thama rahaa he, taaki ye bachche apni jaan dekar use jindagi baksh saken
 It is said that if someone wants to destroy someone, then kill him today
 ye bacchiyaan bagdadi kaa aaj bhi hai or bagdadi kaa kal bhi
 That is, also Mustaqbil
 bas is ek tasviir ke jariye bagdadi hamen aaj kaa syah pal bhi dikhaa rahaa he or tabaahi kaa kal bhi
 Both the innocent who are now of the age of Christians, are currently preparing for that which will make the whole world be heard
 ye bacchiyaan is vakt taiyaar ho rahi hai, lekin skool jane ke liye nahin naa hi baahal apane doston ke saath khilne jane ke liye
 Now both of them will leave their parents
 baqayada gale lag kar
 Parents will also love them
 magar is vidaai ke baad ye maa-baap bhale roen na roen lekin aapaki ankhen roengi
 Her own parents told these innocent and taught that as soon as they get out of this house, they will go straight to heaven
 wo jananath jiskaa sapana inhen bagdadi ne diya he
 They are innocent
 inhen to abhi jananath kya duniya kii bhi samaj nahin, lekin kya karen
 If you are innocent then parents are sure
 acha-bura nahin pataa
 They are good parents isi maa ne inhen bagdadi ke jananath kaa sapana dikhaa kar inhen jehad ke liye taiyaar kiya he
 That is, the idea of sending Jannat to these two innocent people is from this mother
 par kyon? kyon ek maa-baap apni phool jaisi bacchiyon ko bagdadi ke liye qurbaan karne par amada he? in maasoom ke baap ne yahi sawaal apni bivi se poocha, to padhie uski bivi or in maasoom kii maa kya jawaab detii he? ho saktaa he ye jawaab aapako baichaiyn kare, lekin padhie
 
 
 Terrorist - Why do you want to send your daughters to die
 ye to abhi mahaz 7 or 8 saal kii hai
 They are too small, at least for jihad
 bacchiyon kii maa-jihad ke liye koi bhi chota yaa bada nahin hota
 This is the duty of every Muslim
 aatanki-tum sahi kah rahi ho
 May Allah protect you and accept this sacrifice of your daughters
 acha ab khuda kii is jang main shaamil hone ke liye inhen jane do
 Terrorists with little girls - would you like to kneel in front of those infidels who rape and kill you or would you like to kill them
 ham ek aise shandaar mazahab se taalluk rakhte hai, jo dushmano ke zulm ke saamne nahin jhukate hai
 Girls - yes, you don't need to panic, because both of you are going to heaven
 bacchiyaan-allaaho akbardonon bacchiyon ko bamon ke kapade se taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Ammo is tied on the body of both of them
 yani ye is vaktmanav bamahain
 i do not know the bombs that these girls are going to tie on their bodies and explode
 uske baad is maa ko unke tukade bhi milenge yaa nahin, lekin ise kamaal hi kahiebagdadika, jo islam ke naam in logon ke zehan se aise khel khel rahaa he ki ankhen hote hue bhi ye andhe ho chuke hai
 They do not understand the difference between jihad and jahalat

 The dispute between the players and the West Indies Cricket Board in the past is well known
 hupar kaa maananaa he ki ipel ne lambii avadhi ke praaroop main team kii pareshaaniyaan badhaai hai
 Hooper, who played 102 Test matches for the West Indies, has come to India after 16 years to commentate in the two-test series
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen isse (westeindies cricket par ipel ke prabhaav) avgat hona chahie
 T20 cricket should remain
 'hupar ne kaha, 'aapako aaj paanch saal pehle kii tulana main adhik lig main khilne kaa mauka mil rahaa he
 We are affected by this, as most of the young players of the West Indies aim to contract with an IPL team
 ’apane nae ghar edilade main kai restaurant chalaane vaale hupar ne kaha, ‘isse uski westeindies cricket main uplabdhta par asar padataa he or isamen test cricket bhi shaamil he
 Due to the payment dispute and the option of playing in T20 leagues around the world, players like Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo, Kieron Pollard and Sunil Narine are preferring to play in shorter formats
 hupar ne kaha, ‘ipel keval chah hafte ke liye hota he, lekin hamaari sthiti yah he ki sunil naren jaise gendbaaj jinhone apane antim test match (2013 main) chah wicket nikaale the, vah phir se hamaare liye nahin khele

 Recently, several Congress leaders have joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in Maharashtra
 ab is mudde par bhaajapa kii hi saathi shivasena ne tanj ksaa he
 On Thursday, an article has been written in the Shiv Sena newspaper Saamana that the Bharatiya Janata Party or the Shiv Sena should not become a cradle for Congress people, we think so

 The second thing is that the 'incoming' of the congress-nationalist may have seemed profitable in his house today, but later on it can prove to be painful
 bataa den ki shivasena kaa ye lekh tab aayaa he jab virdohi dal ke netaa radhakrishna vikhe-patil ke suputr sujay ne bhartiya janata party main pravesh kiya he
 While joining BJP, Sujay Patil had said that i have taken this decision by going against the wishes of father and family
 shivasena ne likhaa he ki chote patil kisi bhi tarah saansad bananaa chahta hai, bijepi main vah isliye aae hai kyonki unhen ummid he ki loksabhaa chunaav main unhen tikat mil jayega
 Shiv Sena said that there are many more leaders who are standing in the queue to join BJP and BJP people are very happy to see this happening
 lekh main kaha gaya he ki kal ko shivasena kaa mukhyamantri hoga to us samay bukamp kaa remote shivasena ke paas hoga or ye gharaane shivasena bhawan kii qatari main khadey honge
 Therefore only his people and original idea are true
 haalanki, ant main tanj kasate hue shivasena ne bijepi main shaamil hue logon kaa swaagat bhi kiya

 Mishra said that Trinamool members beat up the assembly, following which his party MLA Gaurang Chattopadhyay had to be hospitalized

 Before the Union Budget, the government departments spend money in the previous budget
 is baar aisa nahin hoga
 The Central Government has asked all the departments not to empty their treasury before the end of the financial year
 sarkaar kii taraf se yah nirdesh saatven vetan ayog ke liye fund jutaney kii kavayad ke chalate diya gaya he
 According to the Finance Ministry, the central government will not give additional grants to the departments for the next financial year as the pressure is on to raise funds to implement the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission
 haalanki vitt mantralay ne manaregaa par hone vaale kharch ko is nirdesh se baahar rakhaa he
 What will change from 7th Pay Commission 1
 saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshonko lagu karne se lagbhag 1 karod kendriya karmchaaree or pensionbhogiyon kii kamai main ausatan 23
 There will be a 5 percent increase
 2
 By implementing the recommendations of the Pay Commission, the employees receiving salary will have an increase in cash - both real and digital
 iskaa sidhaa phayda desh main khapat main ijaphe ke taur par dekhne ko milegaa
 3
 parivaar ke paas bade hue paise se desh main ghar or gadiyon kii maang badhane ke puure asaar hai
 Banks hope that this increasing demand will increase the lending of banks in the country, which will enable banks to register more business and profits
 4
 In case of more money in the pocket of employed people, there will be an increase in consumer demand in durable goods, which will help in creating more jobs in the industrial sector along with business boom
 5
 After the implementation of the recommendations of the past Pay Commission, it has been seen directly that FMCG companies including automobile sector and consumer durables have benefited the most
 6
 After the implementation of the recommendations of the Pay Commission, the increase in the expenses of the people getting salary will increase the revenue of the government
 adhik paise kaa saaf matlab he ki logon kii sevings main bhi ijapha darj hoga or yahi arthvyavastha main middle class kii sabase badi takat he
 7
 kanjumar guds kii adhik maang se desh main inflation badhane kaa bhi khatra he
 However, the government has kept inflation under control during the last two years
 isse demand ke jariye badhane vaali mahangaai aam aadmi or sarkaar ke liye zyada badi pareshaani nahin hogi
 8
 saatven vetan ayog ke positive impact kii ummid par rigerv bank sabhi bainkon se byaaj dar kam karne kii apil kar rahi he
 Therefore, once the central government sends its 47 lakh employees and 53 lakh pensioners the amount of increase from the Pay Commission, car, car and home loans will become cheaper in the country
 9
 The increased income from the Seventh Pay Commission and the availability of loans at low rates in the country are sufficient to revive the sluggish real estate sector in the country
 10
 Higher consumption and higher demand will have a direct impact on the increase in new jobs in the country

 The Congress on Wednesday denied the claim that Congress President Sonia Gandhi had ever met Lalit Modi or sought help

 Surjewala alleged that at the behest of the Modi government, Lalit Modi is issuing a statement on Twitter
 surajevaala ne kaha, 'congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne lalit modi se kabhi koi madad nahin maangi
 Also, there has never been any meeting between these two

 team india ke tii20 captain mahendra singh dhoni ne world tii20 ko dhyaan main rakhte hue suresh raina ko chauthe number par hi ballebaaji ke liye utaarne kaa man banaaya he
 Raina is expected to play at number three in the absence of vice-captain Virat Kohli against Sri Lanka, but Dhoni said that the team would prefer to bat at number four
 haalanki dhoni ne yah bhi kaha ki unhone ne bhi pal bhar ke liye unhen (raina ko) number teen par utaarne ke bare main sochaa tha
 Before the first match of the three-match T20 series on Tuesday, Mahendra Singh Dhoni said, 'it came to our mind (to use Raina at number three) but it would be a little better for him (raina) to bat at the place where He is most likely to play in the spaceworld T20
 ’ dhoni ne kaha, ‘hamen use anubhav dena hoga kyonki hamaari team kaaphi tii20 match nahin khelti
 Usually we play a one-match series
 yah siries hamen use paryaapt samay tak chauthe number par parakhane kaa mauka degi
 It would be better to have someone else bat at number four and feed him up one place so that we can feed him at number four so that he can adjust
 ’ ipel main tii20 praaroop main shandaar pradarshan karne vaale raina mangalvaar ko apana 50waan tii20 antarrashtriya match khelenge or vah captain dhoni ke baad yah uplabdhi hasil karne vaale duusare bhartiya ballebaaj honge
 In the context of the series against Sri Lanka, Dhoni said that in this and then through the Asia Cup in Bangladesh this month, the Indian team will have a chance to get into the rhythm before the World T20 Championship
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘ham ab kuch samay tak sirf tii20 praaroop khelenge
 The series will be followed by the Asia Cup, some practice matches and the World T20
 isane hamen lay main aane kaa mauka diya he kyonki alag alag praaroop kii jarurat alag hoti he
 'he said,' i think it will give an opportunity to reconcile
 australia main pichley teen maichon (bharat ne 3-0 se clinasweep kiya) se bhi madad milegi or yahaan halaat vahi honge jo hamen isisi world tii20 main milenge
 Dhoni said that the team looked very balanced and the presence of a player like Hardik Pandya at number eight also has depth in batting
 unhone kaha, ‘philhal team kaaphi santulit najar aa rahi he
 If you look at all 15 players, it seems to be a team that has stability
 hamaare paas hardik pandya ko tej gendbaaji alrounder ke rup main istemaal karne kaa vikalp he
 Dhoni said, "yuvraj Singh bowled well for us and Raina can also bowl spin
 yah acchhee santulit team lagati he
 We are lucky that we can bat till number eight
 agar hardik aathven number par ballebaaji ke liye aata he to upar ke ballebaajon ke paas svachhndatha se ballebaaji kaa mauka hoga
 And it will help if it is a knockout match

 On the first day of the Melbourne Test, the Indian bowlers kept the match on par, although by the end of the day's play it was decided that the Indian bowlers would have a tough time on the second day
 isaki vajah thi ki australian captain steven smith kaa wicket par tike hona
 He was playing for 72 runs
 jaisaa dar tha, melbern test ke duusare din vaisaa hi hua
 Steven Smith hit a third century in the third Test in a row
 vah shatak banaakar hi thame nahin, balki pehle apane 150 ran bhi puure kiye, haalanki smith apane kariyar kaa pehla doharaa shatak bhale puraa nahin kar paae, lekin unhone captain ke taur par apni team ko us mukaam tak pahunchaa diya he, jahaan se team keval jeet ke bare main soch sakati he
 Smith might not have thought, but if he had completed a double century, the youngest captain would have had a record of scoring a double century
 don breadman ne 1937 main 28 saal or 131 din kii umr main yah record banaaya tha
 Smith, 25 years and 208 days, still has plenty of time to make this record
 baharhaal, melbern test kii unki pari keval captaini pari bhar nahin thi, balki unhone apane saathi khilaadiyon ko bhi ran banane ke liye prerit kiya
 He first played a half-century partnership with Shaun Marsh, then added 110 runs with Brad Haddin, 50 with Mitchell Johnson, then 106 for the eighth wicket with Ryan Harris, for the ninth wicket with Nathan Lyon Added 48 runs together
 ab jaraa is test siries main unki pariyon par ek najar daaliye, edilade test kii pehali pari main noteout 162 ran, duusari pari main out hue bina 52 ran
 a superb 133 in the first innings of the Brisbane Test, 28 runs before being run out in the second innings, followed by 192 in Melbourne
 is dauraan yah bhi dhyaan dene kii baat he ki unhone har us paristhiti main team ke liye shatak banaaya jab team ko sabase zyada jarurat thi
 Steven Smith has scored a century for the seventh time in the last 14 Tests
 unke shatak australian team ke liye kis kadar sabit hote hai, iskaa andaja isse lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unhone melbern se pehle jab chah shatak banaae hai, paanch baar team test jeetne main kaamyaab rahi, jabaki ek match drow rahaa he
 This includes emphatic centuries in Perth and Sydney to achieve the Ashes series against England
 test main australia ko number ek team banane ke liye centurian main dakshin africa ke khilaaf shatak bhi is suchi main he
 After becoming captain, he has scored a century in both his first Test
 vijay hajaare, jaiki macgilue, sunil gavaskar or elister cook ke baad is uplabdhi tak pahunchane vaale smith mahaj paanchaven captain hai, jinhone pehle donon test main shatak puraa kiya ho
 Now think of a cricketer who, when first selected in the Australian Test team in 2010, was called in to replace spin bowler Nathan Haritz and it was believed that this spinner would one day replace Shane Warne
 
 australia chayankartaaon kii soch sahi nahin thi, vah jisamen worne ko talash rahe the, vah to ek joardaar ballebaaj, behtareen fielder or kshamtawan leader sabit hua, jo ab nihsandeh australian cricket kaa bada sitara ban chukaa he

 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle bhi sheersh court ne is maamle main sakht rukh apanaaya tha
 The SC had asked when the nine projects would be completed and how much it would cost
 or inamen rakam koun lagayegaa
 It is worth noting that in the report presented in court by the buyers, 9 projects of Amrapali have been divided into 3 categories
 inamen ek wo hai jisamen abhi bhi kuch log rah rahe hai jisamen lift, fire sefti, power byaap jaisi suvidhaayen nahin hai
