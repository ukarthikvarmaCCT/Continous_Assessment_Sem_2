 Nawaz Sharif should tell that India has not carried out a surgical strike, has not crossed the Line of Control, then what attack are they condemning
 kya ve seemaa par hone vaali golibari kii har ghatana kii ninda karte hai
 Pakistan's Defense Minister Khwaja Mohammad Asif has said twice that if our peace is threatened, we will use nuclear weapons and destroy India
 ye shanti kii chahat rakhane vaale pakistan ke pradhanmantri nawaz shareef ke mantrimandal ke sadsy kaa bayaan he
 The Prime Minister of Pakistan has called a cabinet meeting on Kashmir on Friday
 5 oktober ko nawaz sharif ne sansad kaa sanyukt satr bulaai he
 The situation of the alert is also from Pakistan, but even after this, the Indian Army executed the action
 sena ko badhaaiyon kaa tantaa laga hua he
 One particular thing is that whatever detail has come out, it shows that the army has not suffered anything in the whole operation, nor has Pakistan made any such claim
 pakistan ne yahi kaha he ki unki sena ne bhi munhtod jawaab diya he lekin uske do sainik maare gaye hai
 The Army's formal statement does not contain the details of the operation, but according to the sources quoted by the sources, the surgical strike across the Line of Control was planned immediately after the Uri attack
 pradhanmantri ko isaki jaankaree thi lekin manzuri buudhvaar dopaher ko hi di gai
 The terrorists' launch pads were being watched across the Line of Control for over a week
 niyantran rekha ke paar 250 kilometre ke daayre main saat jagahon par is oparation ko anjaam diya gaya
 As a cover, mortars were fired earlier in the night so that special forces could enter
 poonch, mendhar, maachil or naugaanv se special force kii timen niyantran rekha main do kilometre tak andar ghusin
 Special forces teams were brought across the Line of Control by helicopter
 bhimber, kel, tathapani or lipa ilaake main aatankiyon ke launch pad ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Commandos of the Army's 4 and 9 Para Special Forces carried out this action
 sutron ke hawaale se karrwai ke dauraan 36 aatankiyon ko dher karne kaa daawa kiya gaya or do pakistani sainik maare gaye
 The jawans involved in the operation were given clear instructions that they should not leave the dead body of any jawan or any of his companions behind
 special para ke qareeb dedh sau commando ne raat saadhe baarah se subah saadhe chaar baje ke bich is oparation ko anjaam diya
 He was given a specific time period for carrying out the surgical strike
 uri kii ghatana ke das din baad bharat ne karrvai kii he
 India did nothing immediately but did not delay much in taking action
 kerala se die gaye pradhanmantri ke bhaashan se log samajhane lage the ki yuddh hamaare hit main nahin he lekin kuch karnaa hi nahin chahie wo ise pachaa nahin paa rahe the
 Will this debate continue on every attempt to infiltrate from across the border
 bharat pramaan detaa he lekin un sabooton kaa kya matlab jab duusari ghatana ho jaati he or pichhali ghatana par koi karrwai hi nahin hoti
 The Prime Minister had jointly talked about removing poverty, now it seems that poverty was not the code word for this action
 samrik ranneetiyaan code verde main hi to saarvajanik kii jaati hai
 The comments ek baar phir bataa den ki bharat ne apni taraf se bataa diya he ki uski taraf se karrwai puri hoti he
 It is being repeatedly emphasized that this is not war
 jawaab he
 Now the question is getting deeper about the possibility of war
 lekin das dinon ke baad karrwai ke dauraan in ashankaon ko bhi sarkaar ne puri tarah parakh liya hi hoga
 There are reports from many places that an alert has been issued in the border villages

 The Border Security Force on the Wagah border canceled the retreat ceremony
 sena ke javaanon kii chhuttiyaan radd hone kii bhi khabaren aa rahi hai
 There was never a bigger attack on the Indian Army that took place in Uri
 pathankot airbase hamale se bhi zyada nuksaan is hamale main hua
 The Government of India has not only responded at the border but also maintained political cohesion within the border so that the voice is one
 shaam hote hote pakistan se jawaab dene kii khabaren aane lagi hai
 Pakistan Army Chief Raheel Sharif has briefed the mps there
 islamabad sthit bharat ke rajdoot ko bulaakar kaha gaya he
 What was to happen is what has to happen or what has to happen has not happened yet
 bharat or pakistan ke share bazaar ek se hi nikle
 Fear of war fell at both places
 ek khaas baat yah he ki jo bhi detail saamne ai he usase yahi pataa chalata he ki puri karrwai main sena ko kuch bhi nuksaan nahin hua he, na hi pakistan ne aisa koi daawa kiya he
 Pakistan has said that their army has given a befitting reply but two of its soldiers have been killed
 sena ke aupchaarik bayaan main oparation kii baarik jaankariyaan nahin hai lekin sutron ke hawaale jo baaten samvaadadaataaon tak pahunch rahi hai uske hisaab se niyantran rekha ke paar sargical strike kii yojana udi hamale ke fouran baad bana lee gai thi
 The Prime Minister was aware of this but the approval was given only on Wednesday afternoon
 ek hafte se niyantran rekha ke paar aatankiyon ke launch pads par nigaah rakhi ja rahi thi
 The operation was carried out at seven places within a 250 km radius of the Line of Control
 kavring ke taur par raat main pehle mortar fir kiye gayi taaki special forces andar ja saken
 Special force teams from Poonch, Mendhar, Machil and Naugaon entered the Line of Control for two kilometers
 helicopter ke zarie special force kii tiimon ko niyantran rekha ke paar pahunchaaya gaya
 The launch pads of the terrorists were targeted in Bhimber, Kel, Tatapani and Lipa areas
 sena kii 4 or 9 para ke special force ke commandos ne is karrwai ko anjaam diya
 During the operation quoting sources, 36 terrorists were claimed to be killed and two Pakistani soldiers were killed
 oparation main shaamil javaanon ko ye saafe nirdesh die gaye the ki wo kisi bhi jawan kaa shav yaa apane kisi saathi ko peeche chhodkar naa aaen
 About one hundred and fifty commandos of the special paras carried out this operation between twelve and half hours from four o'clock in the morning
 sargical strike ko anjaam dene ke liye unhen ek khaas samay avadhi di gai thi
 India has taken action ten days after the Uri incident

 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki bihar main kanoon kaa raaj he, rajya main don kii koi jagah hi nahin he
 If a don is seen here, it will go inside, it has no place outside
 nitish bole- bihar ko centre kii madad kii sakht jaruratnitish kumaar somvaar ko bihar industries association (biie) ke 72wein vaarshik samaaroh main bol rahe the
 He said that though the path of Bihar development is growing, but for the backward states like Bihar, there is a dire need of the help of the Central Government
 unhone kaha, 'centre sarkaar jab tak samaveshi niti par amal nahin karegi, tab tak desh ke vikaas main gati nahin aegi
 This is the reason why the country's economic growth is constantly fluctuating
 isaki ekmaatr vajah he ki desh kaa vikaas chand viksit rajyon par nirbhar he
 It does not depend on backward states like Bihar
 'agle maheene hoga udhyami panchayat kaa aayojanmukhyamantrine kaha ki agle maheene bihar main udhyami panchayat kaa aayojan kiya jayega, jisamen udyomiyon kii samasyaayein suni jaaengi
 He said that the report of what action took place in the previous panchayats will also be presented
 unhone saaf kaha ki sarkaar biie or chembar of commers, do hi agenciyon ke madhyam se udhyamiyon kii baat sunegi
 Sarkar will launch new scheme on October 2, Nitish Kumar said that we are committed to fulfill the seven-decision program of the government and the government is continuously working in this direction
 unhone bataaya ki ki sarkaar baapu kii jayanti ke din 2 oktober ko yuvaaon ke vikaas ko lekar kai yojanaon kii shuruyaat karne ja rahi he
 In an attempt to cash in on surgical strikes in the upcoming elections, the Modi government has cut the pension of soldiers
 raksha mantralay ne seva ke dauraan viklang hone vaale sainikon kii pension main 18 hajaar rupee prati maheene kii katautee kii he
 The decree of this deduction was issued the very next day of the surgical strike
 28-29 sitambar kii ratbhartiya sena ke elite commandopioke main ghuse or aatankwaadiyon ke kai camp tabah kar die
 These commandos had crossed the loc putting their lives at risk
 agle din deshbhar main sargical strike kaa shor tha or uri hamale kaa badla liye jane kaa jashn
 The happiest thing was that our commandos came without inflicting any major injury to the enemy
 lekin agar us oparation ke dauraan koi jawan buree tarah chotil ho jaataa he or 100 viklaangata kii shrenee main aa jaataa to use naukari se nikaal diya jaataa or use milane vaale pension ko 45,200 rupee se ghataakar 27,200 rupee prati maheene kar diya jaataa
 Because on 30 September, the Ministry of Defense issued a decree related to disability pension
 bijness standard kii report ke mutabik, sarkaar ke is elaan se sabase zyada nuksaan to un afasaron ko hua he jo aise oparations main team leader hote hai
 That is, officers of Major rank
 sarkaar ke nae elaan ke mutabik 100 fisadi viklaangata vaale major rank ke afasaron ke pension main 70 hajaar rupee prati maheene kii katautee kii gai he
 Junior commissioned officers who are considered to be the backbone for the army have also fallen on this decree
 inke pension main 40 hajaar rupee prati maheene kii katautee kii gai he
 Before the notification of 30 September, the pension of 100 percent disabled soldiers and officers was fixed according to their last salary
 iske alaava unhen pension kaa 'sarvice component' bhi miltaa tha jo unki aakhri selary kaa 50 fisadi hota tha
 The new rules are applicable from January 1, 2016, which the government has brought under the new Pay Commission
 nae niyamon ke mutabik, 'sarvice component' main koi badlaav nahin aayaa he lekin 'slab system' lagu kiya gaya he jo percentage system kii tulana main kaaphi kam he
 After five years of service, a soldier gets a salary of 30, 400 rupees
 100 fisadi viklaangata ke baad ab use 12, 000 rupee prati maheene kii pension milegi
 Similarly, after 10 years of service, a major gets a salary of 98, 300 rupees, but now he will get only 27 thousand rupees every month under disability pension
 kendriya mantri arun jetali ne buudhvaar ko congress par hameshaa 'obisi-virdohi hone kaa aarope lagaaya' or kaha ki congress hameshaa anya pichhadaa varg(obisi) ke aarakshan cote ko kam karnaa chaahati he
 Jaitley said that the Congress has become more and more an ideology-less party and now being anti-modi has become its ideology
 apane fasebuk post main jetali ne kaha, congress ko achaanak obisi par pyaar aa gaya, jabaki yah hameshaa se obisi-virdohi rahi he or isane avasarwaadi rup se gaiyr-pichhadon kaa samarthan kiya he
 Jaitley said, why this sudden love for OBC? The OBC left the Congress party before 1990
 unhone kaha, rajeev gandhi ne mandal kamishan ke viruddh loksabhaa main kadaa bayaan diya tha
 Recently, the Congress party opposed the grant of constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes
 unhone sansad main sanvaidhanik sanshodhan ke khilaaf vot kiya tha
 The minister alleged that the Congress wants to reduce the quota for obcs by supporting reservation for the non-backward, while it is well aware that the judiciary will not allow more than 50 percent reservation and the OBC quota is reduced due to the arrival of new contenders

 rahul gandhi kehete hai ki dhaba chalaanaa starop ke liye launch pad ho saktaa he
 In dynastic politics, political aspects are genetic, but intelligence is not
 unhone kaha, jab aapako sahi lagata he, aap obisi kaa virodh karte ho
 When opportunism is needed, you shed tears for them
 aap pakora tal ke utpann naukariyon ko band kar sakate ho
 You can describe the specialty of running a dhaba
 netaaon kii kam jaankaree vichaardhaara ban jaati he
 Jaitley said, this can only happen in a party which has gone ideological
 khud ko peeche dhakelnaa, kshetreey partiyon ke pichhalggu kii tarah kaam karnaa, yah sab isliye hai, kyonki inke andar keval ek hi vyakti narendra modi kaa dar he
 Congress's inauguration on the Facebook post of Arun Jaitley, Congress in-charge Randeep Surjewala has also hit back
 unhone kaha, jetali kaa blog bataata he ki unki raajnneetik praasangikta khatm ho gai he
 Shri Arun Jaitley's wasteful blogs are a clear case of finding lost political relevance by churning unadulterated lies! Has BJP & Shri Jailtey become 'agenda-less', 'achievement-less' & 'argument-less'? People of India are fed up with 'modi-nomics & jaitley-nomics'statement-pic

 Sanjay Mishra, a name that nobody had heard ten years ago, which was not in discussion anywhere, which used to be in films but was not seen
 sanjay mishra bollywood ke wo actor hai jinhone dhire-dhire bollywood main apni pahchaan banaai
 Today, on the birthday of Sanjay Mishra, we are telling the story of that star who continued to do small roles, but when he got the opportunity, he showed with his acting how much power he had
 sanjay mishra kaa janm 6 oktober, 1963 ko bihar ke darbhanga main hua tha
 He made his debut in the year 1995 with Shahrukh Khan's film o Dorling Ye Hai India
 bataa rahe hai unki aisi paanch filmon ke bare main jinamein unki acting ko khub saraahaa gaya or in filmon ko bhi khub pasand kiya gaya
 Aankhen Dekhi- (2014) Sanjay Mishraki This film is considered one of the most brilliant films of his career so far
 is film main unhone ek aise shaks kaa role play kiya tha jo apni job se tang aakar ritairement lene kaa faisla karata he or jivan kaa saar jaanane kii koshish karata he
 During this time some people start calling him crazy and some people call him spiritual
 wo jivan ko lekar apni alag hi philospi banaata he or usamen jeena pasand karata he
 English says- (2018) In this film, Sanjay Mishra chose the romantic role even at this turn of age
 film main pati-patni kii aisi bonding ke bare main dikhaaya gaya tha jo aamtaur par har ghar main pai jaati he
 But till date, husband or wife is able to understand its meaning
 film main inhen kuch galatchhemiyon ko ujagar kiya gaya he, saath main ye bhi bataaya gaya he ki kaise ek hasband-wif ke bich kii paraspar samaj, ek majboot rishte kii neenv rakhti he
 Through Kadva Hawa (2017), an attempt was made to tell that if we are still not aware, then this environment in which we are living openly will become the biggest threat to us
 real insident or gaanv main pade sookhe par bani is film main sanjay mishra behad samvedansheel role main najar aae the
 Saare Jahan Se Khiladi- (2013) It was a political film film
 film ke madhyam se ye dikhaane kii koshish kii gai thi ki mahangaai kii maar ek middle class family main kis tarah se padati he
 The film was well liked
 magar kai saare logon kaa aisa maananaa tha ki achche idia ko adopt karne ke baavjood film or behatar tareeke se pesh kii ja sakati thi
 Whatever may be, what can be more than Sanjay Mishra's performance to cover small flaws of such films
 unhone ummid anusaar aisa kiya bhi
 Masaan (2015) was not his role lead in the movie Masaan, but despite this, his acting in the film was praised
 unhone film main richaa chaddha ke pita kaa role play kiya tha jo apni beti se pareshaan bhi he or use pyaar bhi bahut karata he

 unhone mukhyamantri se is gairjimmedaarana bayaan ko waapas lene or aise bayaan ke liye puure raashtra se maafee maangane kii maang kii jisase karodon logon kii bhaavnaayen aahat hui hai
 Tiwari said that the Congress's advice to the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh is to control his voice and vocabulary when he makes a statement about such great persons

 How different is the film from Sanjay Baru's book Perfilm
 kitaab ke alaava bhi kai duusari chizon ko jodne kii baat saamne aa rahi he
 In a scene shown in the trailer, Rahul Gandhi is seen tearing the paper
 ye ghatana sanjay baru kii book relies hone ke baad kii he
 So, have the makers included events outside the book for the thrill of the Bollywood film? When Anupam Kher was questioned about this at a press conference, he was silent
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne shapath lene ke baad bhaashan diya, is bhaashan ke dauraan unhone 20 baaten aisi boli hai jo aane vaale samay main jumale kii tarah istemaal kii ja sakati hai

 Putting him in jail twice 3-koi aapse rishwat maange to manaa mat karnaa
 Setting up jeb main haath daalana
 Record it in your mobile phone

 Our entire team will work for 4-24 hours
 main, mere mantri, mere emele 24-24 ghante kaam karenge

 But regardless of our body and mind, we will work
 6-dilli ke log shantipriy hai ji
 7-prime Minister, you have the job of the whole country
 videsh bhi janaa hota he
 Leave the responsibility of those who run Delhi to the people of Delhi
 8-chaahe aapane hamen vot diya yaa nahin diya

 9-ek bhi paisa chori nahin hoga
 Therefore, tax will be given freely
 10-sarkaar ke paas paise kii kami nahin he
 Money is a lot niyat kii kami he
 11-the people of this country are very good
 janata ko gale laga lo
 She will develop herself
 12-ye aapako acha lagata he ki koi mantri laal batti vaali gaadi lekar puspun tountun karata chalaa jaae

 pakistan main baithe jaish-e-mohammad ke aatanki masood ajahar kii shah par pulavama main aisa aatankwaadi hamalaa hua he, jisane puure desh ko dahala diya he
 After this terrorist attack, the voice of destroying Jaish is being raised, but the question is also about who has ignored the alert of intelligence agencies
 pulavama hamale se puraa desh stabdh he, dukhi he or acroshit bhi
 So far, 37 CRPF personnel have been martyred in this terrorist attack on Thursday
 grih mantri rajnath singh shuukravaar ko kashmir ja rahe hai
 NSA Ajit Doval has called an emergency meeting
 grih sachiv ko bhootnaa se turant waapas bulaayaa gaya, lekin sawaal he ki aisi jaghanya ghatnaon se pehle jaruri kadam kyon nahin uthaae jate
 According to intelligence, the intelligence agencies had already anticipated such an attack
 ajtak ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik, suraksha agenciyon ne aath farvari ko ye alert jari kiya tha ki jammu kashmir main aatankwaadi iidi hamalaa kara sakate hai
 According to the sources, the alert said that the militants in Jammu and Kashmir could attack the IED on the deployment of security forces and on their way to and fro
 to kya hamaari chook se itnaa bada aatankwaadi hamalaa ho gaya or hamen apane anmol javaanon kii shahadat deni padi
 Following this input, the security agencies also held a meeting with the security forces
 meeting main kaha gaya tha ki aatanki surakshabalon ke kafile ko nishaanaa bana sakate hai
 This attack can be carried out like the terrorist attacks in Syria and Afghanistan
 aise main suraksha balon ko apana kafila raat main lekar janaa chahie
 Despite this, the convoy left to take CRPF personnel to Srinagar the day after the highway opened for seven days due to snowfall
 ab aise main sawaal uthta he ki aakhir siarpief ne khufia report ko kyon ignor kiya
 In this case, former CRPF IG RK Singh said that when there was an alert of terror attack, then why the soldiers were not sent from Jammu to Srinagar by helicopter
 agar unhen helicopter ke jariye srinagar bheja jaataa to itnaa bada hamalaa nahin ho saktaa he
 The government will have to provide such facilities to the security forces, so that our soldiers do not fall prey to such attacks
 loksabhaa chunaav (lok Sabha Elections) ke pehle phej kaa matdaan 11 april ko kiya janaa he
 There are many candidates in the total 1266 candidates who are millionaires, while there are some who are also very poor

 According to the information provided by ADR, the richest candidate in the first phase is KV Reddy of Congress, who is contesting from Chevalla parliamentary constituency of Telangana
 unhone apane halafname main 895 karod kii sampatti ghoshit kii he

 pivi potluri andhra pradesh ke vijaywada se sansadeey chunaav lard rahe hai
 Among the 1266 candidates who have filed their nomination papers in the first phase, YSR Congress candidate PV Potluri from Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh is the second richest with a net worth of Rs 347 crore
 pehle phej main 401 (32%) karodpati ummidavaar hai, jabaki ummidavaaron kii ausat sampatti 6
 63 crores
 hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki in chunaavon main 23 ummidavaaron ne dikalair kiya he ki unke paas koi sampatti nahin he jabaki en prem kumaar (chevella, telugana) ne 500 rupye or rajendra kendurka (koraput, odisha) ne 565 rupeki sampatti ghoshit kii he
 It is a matter of concern that out of 1266 candidates, 213 (37%) candidates have criminal cases against them
 10 ummidavaaron par hatya kaa cese or 25 ummidavaaron par hatya kii koshish kaa cese he
 Election Watch member Jagdish Chokar told NDTV, "this is a commentary on political parties
 wo aise logon ko tikat kyon dete hai
 The focus of political parties is only on the winning candidate
 wo ye nahin dekhati ki ummidavaar kaa becoground kaisaa he''saaf he, paise kaa bolbalaa or aapraadhik prishthbhumi vaale netaaon kii chunaav maidan main badhati maujuudagi bhartiya loktantr ke ek badi chunauti banati dikh rahi he
 Even if the rich and poor candidates have equal value on the scales of the electoral scales, this is also a matter of concern and the challenge is to deal with it
 unhone bataaya ki vah car ko kinare par khadi karke tair badalane lage
 Meanwhile, a canter coming from behind attacked them both
 is ghatana main vikram kii maukey par hi maut ho gai, jabaki munesh gambhir rup se ghayal ho gaya

 Former Indian captain Rahul Dravid backed Mahendra Singh Dhoni, surrounded by criticism, saying that he is the only person capable of leading the Test team, but should give up the Twenty20 captaincy
 dravid ne kaha, dhoni test cricket main bharat kii aguwai karne vaala ekmaatr vyakti hi nahin he, balki vah is kaam ko acchhee tarah karne ke yogya bhi he
 He needs only one change in captaincy for this, that he has to recognize that he cannot do everything all the time and he should show willingness to accept help and ask for it
 unhone 'iespien crickinfo' ke liye apane kollam main likhaa, dhoni ko yah pahchaanana hoga ki vah captain bane rahanaa jari nahin rakh saktaa or har vakt nahin khel saktaa, kyonki isse vah thak jayega
 Dhoni can easily start by skipping the captaincy of India's T20 and Chennai Super Kings
 use captaini, keeping or khilne ke bich main brake lene kii jarurat he
 Dravid said, he should definitely play odis and T20s for India as he is important for the team
 captaini chhodane se use bharat ke liye mukhya kaam karne kaa adhik samay milegaa or isse usamen khilne ke liye taazgi bhi bani rahegi
 This will give India the opportunity to hand over T20 captaincy to such players as (virat) Kohli, which will also give him a break

 unhone kaha, vah acchhee tarah daud saktaa he or vah bharat ke sabase safal captain ke taur par dekha jayega or uske paas ab ise (safal captaini kaarykaal ko) badhaane kaa mauka he
 Apart from his good leadership ability, another reason is that Dhoni has no option at this time

 dravid ne kaha, use nishchit rup se bharat ke liye vanade or tii20 khilne chahie, kyonki vah team ke liye ahm he
 Leaving the captaincy will give him more time to do the main work for India and it will also retain freshness to play in it
 isse bharat ko aise khilaadi jaise (viraat) kohli ko tii-20 captaini saunpane kaa mauka mil jayega, jisase use brake bhi mil jayega
 Then he will see how it goes
 bhartiya team ke england ke khilaaf haalia gharelu test shrunkhlaa main lachar pradarshan or iske baad chir-pratidwandvi pakistan se vanade siries main mili haar se dhoni kii captaini kii aalochana ho rahi he
 The comments haalanki vah balle se acchhee form main he, lekin kuch purv khilaadiyon ko lagata he ki dhoni main bataur captain thakaan ke sanket dikh rahe hai
 But Dravid does not believe that India has any other option than this wicket-keeper-batsman, who led the country in the 2011 one-day World Cup victory besides the 2007 Twenty20 World Cup title win
 dravid ne kaha ki dhoni ko apane main kuch badlaav karnaa chahie
 He said, he can run well and he will be seen as India's most successful captain and he now has a chance to extend it (successful captaincy term)

 Although he is in good form with the bat, some former players feel that Dhoni is showing signs of fatigue as a captain

 Dravid said that Dhoni should make some changes in himself
 unhone kaha, vah acchhee tarah daud saktaa he or vah bharat ke sabase safal captain ke taur par dekha jayega or uske paas ab ise (safal captaini kaarykaal ko) badhaane kaa mauka he
 Apart from his good leadership ability, another reason is that Dhoni has no option at this time
 dravid ne kaha ki dhoni ko apane main kuch badlaav karnaa chahie
 He said, he can run well and he will be seen as India's most successful captain and he now has a chance to extend it (successful captaincy term)
 uski acchhee netritv kshamta ke alaava ek anya kaaran yah bhi he ki is samay dhoni kaa koi vikalp bhi nahin he

 Ansari, president of the Qaumi Ekta Dal, said that it was decided not to contest Mukhtar from Varanasi in the meeting so that secular voters' votes against Modi are not divided

 Now with Ansari's decision, it is Ajay Rai from Congress and Arvind Kejriwal from Aam Aadmi Party against Modi in the election field from Varanasi

 An Indian investigator was quoted as saying that the November 26, 2008 attack on Mumbai and the December 13, 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament were carried out by Indian agencies only to facilitate the passage of stringent anti-terrorism legislation
 The atmosphere can be created
 bataaya jaataa he ki mumbai hamale ke pramukh aropiyon main se ek lakhvi se us adhikari ne kaha, ‘‘bari hone ke liye taiyaar ho jaao
 Lakhvi's lawyer Riyaz Akram Cheema is confident of acquitting his client from now on

 In a complaint filed on June 24, Mani, a former Under Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs, said that Gujarat Special Investigation Team (SIT) chief who investigated the Ishrat Jahan case, Satish Verma in 2009 had filed two conflicting affidavits against him

 Saeed tweeted, "we have been saying since day one that no person associated with jamaat-ud-dawa has anything to do with the 26 / 11 attack in India
 ’’15 july ko jab global media sanyukt raashtra main die gaye bhaashan ke liye taliban peedita malala yusufajai kii tarif main juta tha, tab pakistani media main ek hi naam gunj rahaa tha-satish verma
 Media noises also fueled speculation of a covert conspiracy in Pakistan that these attacks were India's attempt to discredit Pakistan
 yah baat bhula di gai ki pakistan kii ek aatankwaad nirodhi adaalat kaa maananaa tha ki uske paas mumbai hamale ke aaropee par mukadmaa chalaane ke paryaapt aadhaar the
 Perhaps the atmosphere became something due to which the Government of Pakistan was forced to ask for clarification from India
 18 july ko piemail (navaj) kaa aadhikarik twit aayaa ‘‘bharat sarkaar ko apni sthiti spasht kerani chahie or in khulaason kii sachai saamne lani chahie ki 26 / 11 or sansad par 2001 ke hamale farji the

 Only a few months before the Lok Sabha elections held last year, no candidate of Chautala's party could win, but Dushyant Chautala's enthusiasm was neither cold nor he complained to the public

 shaadi
 
 
 This bond is not only a union of two people, but it is also a confluence of two families
 shaadi kaa bandhan do pariwaron ko hameshaa ke liye ek door main baandh detaa he
 The decision of your marriage is an important decision in your life, it affects your husband's life, as much as your mother-in-law's life
 isliye ye zaruri he ki shaadi se pehle aapako apane sasuraal waalon se ek baar baatcheet zarur kerani chahie
 Let us know which are those things that you should do with your in-laws before marriage so that you do not face differences with your in-laws later
 1-apane saas-sasur ke saath ek acha relationships banane ke liye zaruri he ki aap apni lifestil ke bare main unase baat karen
 Whatever your expectations after marriage, it would be better if you tell them
 apane offis ke timming ke bare main baat kerani chahie
 , After returning home from office, you will be able to cook or you want med for help, also talk with your in-laws
 apane weekends plan or apane nijee vakt bitaane ke tareeke kii baatcheet karne se bhi aap apane sasuraal waalon se ek khushhaal rishta bana sakati hai
 That's why banana should be eaten daily, know how many benefits are there- 2- Whether you want to get a job after marriage or want to start a work at home, tell your mother-in-law about your career option
 agar aap apni saileri se ghar kaa koi lone yaa kisi bhi tarah kii EMI chukaa raheen hon to is bare main apane saas-sasur se pehle hi baat kar lenaa aapke bhavishya ke rishte ko majboot banayega
 Doing this will make sense in your relationship
 3-apni gruhasthi or bacchon ke bare main bhale aapane apane hone vaale pati se baat kar lee ho par is bare main aapkaa apane saas-sasur se baat karnaa bhi behad zaruri he
 Even if you do not tell your family plan to them, but do express your thoughts about the family in the future, they should definitely reveal it to them
 is bare main apane vichaar rakhane ke saath-saath aap unki raay bhi puch sakati hai jisase ye baatcheet ek tarafa na lage
 4-after marriage, the responsibility of maintaining and grooming the entire house rests on the woman and we cannot deny this
 to isliye zaruri he ki aap is bare main bhi apni raay saas-sasur ke saamne rakhen
 Tell them how you will handle home and office together
 agar aap ghar main maid rakhana chaahati hai to is bare main bhi unhen pehle hi bataa dena aap logon ke rishte ko nikhaarane kaa kaam hi karata he
 5-before marriage, you should also openly talk about your religious views with your in-laws
 aap puja-paath main vishwaas rakhti hai yaa nahin, mandir janaa pasand karti hai yaa nahin ye sabhi baaten aap apane sasuraal waalon se karen
 Because of any misunderstanding in future, there should not be any problem in your relationship, so it is important that you tell whether you believe in festivals and traditions
 kya aapako bhi sote samay lagate hai jatke, jaaniye matlab6-shaadi ho jane kaa matlab aapaki ummiido kaa maranaa nahin he
 Your dreams, your wishes are always alive
 to isliye zaruri he ki aap apane sapanom ke bare main apane saas-sasur se shaadi se pehle hi baat karen taaki baad main rishton main kisi tarah kii galatarahami na ho
 7-your dreams can be anything like roaming 30 countries before you turn 30, learning dance, buying a farmhouse and not knowing what
 agar aap apni aisi sabhi ichchhaaon ko shaadi se pehle hi apane saas-sasur ke saamne sahi dhang se zaahir kar den to bhavishya main aapke rishton main tanaav nahin aayega
 8-telling your in-laws about your marriage before marriage proves to be very helpful
 aisa karne se aapke saas-sasur ko aapako sahi tarah se samajhane main madad milti he jisase aapke rishte main madhurata aati he

 He said that the rise in gold prices is not due to domestic demand but due to global trend which is likely to be normal on 3 November
 dhanteras ke din johari saal main sabase adhik bikri karte hai

 unka kahana he ki kyonki film nirmaataa kaa paisa daanv par tha, isliye unhen aisa karnaa padaa
 Superstar Rajinikanth was angry with the film's old name

 Lutyens who look calm on the surface, a storm is roaming inside Delhi
 baabuon kaa yah shahar aisi uthal-puthal se guzar rahaa he jaisaa rajeev gandhi yaa indira gandhi kii bahumat vaali sarkaron ke dauraan mahasoos kiya gaya tha
 Many people of Delhi still remember how Rajiv Gandhi, while Prime Minister, suspended a bureaucrat during a press conference
 ek aalaa afasar yah bhi yaad karte hai ki indira gandhi ke raaj main to “naukarshahon kii lagaataar badali hoti rahati thi
 "today, after three decades, the bureaucrats who actually run the country are finding themselves trapped
 ve sashankit hai or naaraaz bhi hai
 There are many reasons for his frustration
 kamjor mantri, bhrashtachar nirodhak kanoon kaa mandaraata saaya or soochna kaa adhikaar, jo unke mutabik milakar ek aisa maahaul bana chukaa he jisamen ek kadam bhi aage badhanaa yaa koi faisla lenaa unke liye asambhav ho chalaa he
 Barring a few ministers, such as finance, defense, road transport and highways, and more or less railways, most ministers have left all their decisions to the Prime Minister's Office, which had about 1,200 files pending till October, while only a few hundred files were available
 Are pending darkinar kiye jane kaa dardnaukarshahon kii maane to is sarkaar ko ek alag kism kii nitigat lakwagrastata apane agosh main jakadti ja rahi he
 While the officers lacked the will and courage to take decisions in the UPA rule, they now have new ideas and ideas, but they are finding themselves bound in laws
 satta ke atyadhik kendrikaran ke kaaran tamaam adhikaron ke chhin jane se halaat or mushkil ho gaye hai
 The bureaucratic fear stems from Narendra Modi's centralized administrative model in which ministers are weakened while the PMO is empowered to appoint and transfer officers
 ek bade adhikari kehete hai, “pehle upie ke shashakt mantriyon ke tahat adhikariyon main yah bhav tha ki “mere mantri ne manjuuri de di he to ab thik he
 The officers are finding themselves in the lurch as the ministers leave this protective shield
 iske alaava pradarshan karne kaa dabaav or piemo ke saath saptahanth kii baithken bhi tanaav ko badha rahi hai
 The freedom to work with protection and rights is absent
 ab adhikariyon kaa sirf chayan or chantni hi piemo nahin kar rahaa balki achaanak tabadalaa bhi kar diya ja rahaa he
 In the last 18 months, the Modi government has reshuffled the posts of officers thrice

 chandrashekhar kehete hai, “mere liye chintajanak baat afasaron ke tabadale kii badhati pravriti he, yahaan tak ki sanyukt sachiv str par bhi yah dekha ja rahaa he
 This has given rise to the impression that barring a few, the other administrative officers are of low standard and their sword is constantly hanging on their heads
 ” ve kehete hai ki aisi ghatnaayen ateet main bhi hoti thim lekin kam thim
 Furthermore, according to him, this trend is not favorable in terms of teamwork
 seva main kareeb chaar dashak bitaa chuke ek bade adhikari in shabdon main dilli kaa haal bayaan karte hai, “dar is baat kaa he ki main kyon koi faisla luun
 i am not being trusted, i am being spied on so that i cannot meet anyone
 behatar hoga ki main khud ko bachaaun or koi faisla na luun
 He says, "whether it is the recovery of spying equipment from Nitin Gadkari's residence or the financial transactions of the home minister's son, the government has given enough indications that everything is being monitored

 This law states that a public servant shall be said to be engaged in a criminal act, if he accepts or agrees to or accept any reward from a person for himself or for another
 aise hi kai praavdhaan isamen shaamil hai jiske chalate adhikari khud ko fansaa hua paa rahe hai
 The provisions of this law come under the purview of all officers, as well as all the leaders of the government including the Prime Minister
 naukarshahon se taalluk rakhane vaala iskaa sabase vivaadaaspad praavdhaan vah he jo kahata he ki unke dwaara liya gaya koi faisla agar kisi tisare paksh ko laabh pahunchaata ho to uski jimmedaari unki hogi
 Officials say this provision could have long-term consequences in the context of ministries like telecom, coal, road transport and highways where decisions related to third parties have to be taken and there will be benefits to one or the other
 aisa karke koi adhikari funs na jaae, is dar se faisle hi nahin liye ja rahe hai
 Big ministries are blowing up and deferring decisions in this matter
 haal hi main jahajrani mantralay ne kuch puraane jahaajon kii bikri se sambandhit ek faisla vinievesh vibhaag ko badha diya tha
 There is also a fear of the investigating agencies which are still looking into the affairs of the UPA Raj

 a top officer asks, "CBI is sitting here, how will FIPB approve anything in front of it?" Officers who take decisions voluntarily are being discouraged

 agar 1500 bed banegaa to nitish kumaar sarkaar ko ek saal ke bheetar 1500 karod karch karne honge
 In 2017-18, the budget of the Government of Bihar was 7002 crores
 jo 2016-17 kii tulana main 1000 karod kam ho gaya tha
 The budget for construction of hospitals was around 800 crores
 kya bihar se bimaariyaan bhaag gayi thim jo health kaa bajet 1000 karod kam kiya gaya? ye jaankaree policy research studies kii site se hamane lee he
 If in one trip, Nitish Kumar announced a hospital with a budget of 1500 to 2500 crores for headline in newspapers, then he would also tell from where the money would come
 is bajet main to puure bihar kaa bajet hi samaapt ho jayega
 To reduce the death toll of 130 children, the announcement of 2500 beds is a game of vile and vicious brains
 sabko pataa he ki patrkaar puuchhenge nahin ki paisa kahaan se aayega
 2500 beds means if you look at 500 beds, 5 hospitals can be built
 kya in 5 aspataalon ko aap aas-paas ke zile main nahin baant sakate the? jisase sabko mujaffarpur aane kii zarurat na hoti or logon kii jaan bachati?610 bed ke aspataal ke liye to abhi doctor nahin hai
 Not only this, 49 years old Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital does not have post-graduate studies in pediatrics
 agar yahaan piji kii das seat bhi hoti to kam se kam 40 junior yaa senior resident to hote hi
 The private colleges of Bihar, which are open later, have all PG seats because they are charged annual fees of crores of rupees
 aam taur par teen bed par ek doctor hona chahie
 If talking about 1500 beds, then there should be no need for about 200-300 doctors
 bed banaakar photo khinchaana he yaa marizon kaa upachaar bhi karnaa he
 There are only 100 seats for medical education in the medical college you have talked about
 2014 main harshavardhan 250 seat karne kii baat kar gaye the
 If you give a seat here, where will you find a hunt for private medical colleges? game samajhie
 Hence Nitish Kumar's announcement is embarrassing and a joke
 aspataal banegaa uski ghoshnaa par mat jaaiye
 Many hospitals are ready in the country but are not running
 gali-gali main khulne vaale ames kii bhi aisi hi haalat he
 In 2018, the Bihar government made another amazing decision
 patna medical kalege main 1700 bed hai
 It will be increased to 5462
 aisa karne se yah duniya kaa sabase bada aspataal ban jayega
 a budget of 5500 crores was kept for this
 chaar-paanch saal main banakar taiyaar ho jayega
 It would overtake the largest hospital in Belgrade
 zarur koi afasar rahaa hoga jo bi se beograd or bi se bihar samajha gaya hoga or sabko mazaa aayaa hoga
 If you had distributed this bed in the whole of Bihar, there would have been one more hospital in many districts
 iske liye patna medical kalege kii puraani aitihaasik imaaraten dhaha di jaaengi
 Apart from PMCH in Patna, there is also Indira Gandhi Medical College called AIIMS
 yah aaj tak dilli ke ames kaa vikalp nahin ban sakaa he
 Here too, 500 beds were inaugurated by Nitish Kumar in this month
 patna ke liye piemasiech or ames kaaphi he
 Had it been good to make a record, if we had divided 5462 beds in the whole of Bihar, no one would have to come to Patna from Saharsa and Ara
 lekin aspataal bhi ab 300 feet kii murti kii sanak kii tarah banane lage hai
 Still you can ask the question from where will you get 1500 doctors for 5462 bed hospital
 piemsich main hi 40 percent doctor kam hai
 There is a shortage of 5000 doctors in Bihar
 kya iske liye nitish kumaar sarkari kalejon main medical kii seat badhwane vaale hai yaa privet medical kalege khol kar kamaane kii taiyaari ho rahaa he
 Why would a doctor join a government medical college? ek ek karod kii fees dekar em bi bi es karegaa or do do karod main piji to vah sarkari kalege main kyon jayega
 Where will i recover my money from? aap jaanate hai ki jo bhi neet se paas karata he use majabuuran in privet kalege main janaa padataa he
 This is a separate cycle of slavery which the society has accepted with pleasure
 privet kalejon kaa shukriya ki ek karod hi paanch saal kaa le rahe hai varna yah janata sarkaar se sawaal kiye bagair paanch karod bhi de sakati thi
 Doctors doing internship in Sri Krishna Medical College after four and a half years of education have not received salary for two and a half months
 15000 rupee milte hai
 May be this is the condition of interns from all over Bihar
 zaahir he bihar sarkaar ke paas paise nahin honge
 Then, at the moment, all of you public should work with the announcement of 2500 beds

 Nothing happened for the next one year
 2015 ke aakhir main swasthya mantri ke taur par je pi nadda bhoomi pujan karte hai
 You can differentiate between the foundation and Bhoomipujan
 23 aktubar 2016 ko je pi nadda twit karte hai ki 2018 main aspataal chaalu ho jayega
 This 710-bed hospital is being built under the supervision of AIIMS, which also monitors the Prime Minister's Office
 jab disambar 2018 main is aspataal kii o pi di chaalu kii gai to 710 bed kaa kahin ata-pataa nahin tha
 When Prime Minister Modi inaugurates it in February 2019, only 20 beds were ready
 aaj bhi bed 20 ke hi aas-paas hai
 The election was close, the headline was to be looted, so it was announced
 jab yah aspataal teen saal main 20 bed se aage nahin ja sakaa, 710 bed nahin bana sakaa, cancer ke kitne hi mariz upachaar ke karche or karze main dub kar mar jate hai, tab nitish kumaar 2500 bed banavaa denge
 Will make 1500 beds in a year
 chaar saal main patna main 5462 bed kaa aspataal banavaa denge
 The health budget of the entire state will be spent in fulfilling these two announcements

 So considering the match situation even if he didn't use his review India were in a good position
 But once the review is wasted then you lose the right to criticize the umpire

 Here, the central government told about the Kohinoor diamond in the Supreme Court that this diamond was not stolen, but it was given to the British by Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Punjab, there was a stir in Odisha over the ownership of the diamond
 
 odisha congress ke daawey ke mutabik, rashtriya abhilekhaagaar main rakhi maharaja ranjit singh kii vasiyat main spasht likhaa he ki kohinoor ko puri ke jagannatha mandir main daan de diya jaae
 State President Prasad Harichandan says, “I have a rare copy of the will
 congress kohinoor ko bharat waapas laane kii maang karte hue andolan chalaaegi or uske pehle charan main pradhanmantri ko har jile se postcard bhejegi
 a petition can also be filed thereafter
 ”bharat main aam dharna he ki kohinoor ko angrejon ne chura liya tha
 But in a hearing on a PIL in the Supreme Court, Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar stated that the British government had neither stolen the Kohinoor diamond nor had it been taken by force
 balki punjab ke maharaja ranjit singh ne east india company ko tohfe main diya tha
 In such a situation, the Government of India cannot claim to take it
 sarkaar kii maane to maharaja ranjit singh ke uttaradhikari dilip singh ne 1849 ke sikh yuddh main harjane ke taur par kohinoor east india company ko diya tha
 However, the Solicitor General also said that this is the opinion of the Ministry of Culture and the reply from the Foreign Ministry is yet to come
 iske baad sheersh adaalat ne jawaab daakhil karne ke liye chah hakrate kaa samay de diya he
 Shortly before this, the statement of Indian-origin MP Keith Vaz in the UK was also in the headlines in which he said that "kohinoor diamond should be returned to India
" ” vaaj kaa yah bayaan congress ke saansad shashi tharur ke us bhaashan ke baad aayaa tha jisamen unhone kaha tha ki britain ko bharat par 200 saal raaj karne kaa harjaana dena chahie
 Tharoor gave this speech at the University of Oxford, in which he said that paying cash damages would be a complicated and lengthy process that would have little meaning
 phir bhi kohinoor heere jaisi nayab cheez to waapas di hi ja sakati he
 This speech by Tharoor was also praised by Prime Minister Modi
 lekin kohinoor par ab sarkaar kaa stand badla hua he
 Harichandan says, "the decision of Maharaja Ranjit Singh should be taken only on the basis of the will
 kohinoor ke maalik ve hi the or unki ichha, jaisaa ki vasiyat main bhi likhaa he, ise jagannatha mandir ko daan main dene kii thi
 Hence Kohinoor should be brought to Odisha
 ”bharat akelaa desh nahin he, jo is heere par daawa jataa rahaa he
 In 1976, Pakistan Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto requested the then British Prime Minister James Callaghan to return it to his country
 iske alaava afghanistan or iran bhi is par daawa jataa chuke hai
 Kohinoor is considered a cursed diamond
 kinvadantiyon kii maane to yah hira jiske paas bhi pahunchaa, uskaa paracham shuru main to khub laharaaya lekin uskaa ant bhi buree tarah hua
 After the arrival of the diamond, the royal family of Britain also faced many troubles

 Earlier, this diamond was near the Kakatiya dynasty
 kohinoor heere kaa ullekh babarnama main bhi miltaa he
 The Kohinoor diamond is believed to have originated from the Golconda mines located in Guntur district of present-day Andhra Pradesh, India
 kohinoor heere kii kabhi koi keemat bhi nahin lag pai kyonki apane puure itihaas main yah ek baar bhi nahin bika
 Either one king won it from another king or it was given in reward
 haalanki isaki keemat kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki 60 saal pehle honkong main ek hira 4
 24, which sold for $ 60 million
 78 carat kaa tha jabaki kohinoor 105

 Congress General Secretary said on microblogging site Twitter, "I never understood the criteria of the Planning Commission to determine the poverty line

 Singh, in another tweet, advocated linking poverty to malnutrition and blood loss
 unhone kaha, garibi kaa pehla suchak parivaar ke sadasyon main kuposhan or khun kii kami he, jiskaa aasaani se pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Can we not make it a yardstick? Singh's statement came at a time when Sibal had a day earlier challenged the Planning Commission's way of assessing poverty, saying that a family of five members could not live for Rs 5000 per month

 Sibal had said in Kolkata, if the Planning Commission says that those earning more than Rs 5000 per month do not come under the poverty line, then there is definitely something wrong in the definition of poverty in the country
 koi 5000 rupee main kaise guzaara kar saktaa he? yojana ayog ne is saptaah kii shuruyaat main garibi sambandhi apane aankade jari karte hue kaha tha ki garibi rekha ke neeche rahane vaale logon kii pratishtata vitt varsh 2004-05 main 37

 (input-ieenes) Released today, Rohan Sippy-directed 'nautanki Saala', starring 'vicky Donor' fame actor Ayushmann Khurrana, and his character's name is Ram
 
 
 yah ram peshey se ek theatre actor or diarector he, or apane naatak main ravan kaa kirdaar nibhaataa he
 
 
 One day he suddenly meets Mandar Lele, ie Kunal Roy Kapur, who is trying to commit suicide
 
 
 ram use khudakushi karne se bachaata he or apane ghar le aata he
 
 
 Ram then tries to reconcile him to his wife, and bring happiness back to his life
 
 
 lekin is koshish main vah khud hi funs jaataa he
 
 
 The story is good, and Rohan Sippy tries to say it in a very different way, but he seems to have failed to produce the script
 
 
 'nautanki saalaa' ke promo dekhakar lag rahaa tha ki shaayad yah kamedi film hogi, lekin asal main yah bilkul alag trek par chalati he
 
 
 Yes, it can make you laugh at some places
 
 
 tippaniyan There is no doubt that an attempt has been made to make the film different, but at its own pace, some scenes make the film loose
 
 
 asal zindagi ko ramayana ke pannon main dhundte diarector ne ek nai baat to saamne rakhi he, lekin phayda tab hoga, jab darshak ise samaj paaen
 
 
 Yes, the scenes, costume, and lights of Ramayana make the film beautiful
 
 
 ayushmaan khurana achche hai, lekin kunal roy kapur kaa abhinay saraahneey he
 
 
 Here i would also like to praise Sanjeev Bhatt, the producer of Ayushmann's drama company, who has done well
 
 
 film main tehraav he, lekin kahin-kahin vah aapako ubaau lag saktaa he
 
 
 Re-mixes of some old songs may sound good to you
 
 
 kul milakar is film ke liye meri reating he - 3 star
 
 
 This Ram is a theater actor and director by profession, and plays Ravana in his play
 
 
 ek din use raste main achaanak miltaa he mandaar lele, yani kunal roy kapur, jo khudakushi karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 
 
 Ram saves her from committing suicide and brings her home
 
 
 iske baad ram koshish karata he, use uski patni se milaane kii, or uski zindagi main khushiyaan waapas laane kii
 
 
 But he gets caught on his own in this attempt
 
 
 kahani acchhee he, or rohan sippi ne use behad alag andaaz main kehane kii koshish kii he, lekin lagata he, vah script taiyaar karne main maat kha gaye
 
 
 Looking at the promos of 'nautanki Saala' it seemed that maybe it would be a comedy film, but in reality it plays on a completely different track
 
 
 haa, kuch-kuch jagah yah aapako hansaa sakati he
 
 
 The comments isamen koi shaq nahin ki film ko alag banane kii koshish kii gai he, lekin apni gati se chalate kuch seen film ko dhilaa bana dete hai
 
 
 Finding the real life in the pages of Ramayana, the director has revealed a new thing, but the benefit will be only when the audience can understand it
 
 
 haa, ramayana ke seen, costum, or lits film ko khubasurat banaate hai
 
 
 Ayushmann Khurrana is good, but Kunal Roy Kapur's performance is commendable
 
 
 yahaan main ayushmaan kii naatak company ke produsar sanjeev bhatta kii tarif bhi zarur karnaa chaahunga, jinhone acha abhinay kiya he
 
 
 There is a pause in the film, but sometimes it can make you feel bored
 
 
 kuch puraane gaanon ke ri−mix aapako sunne main achche lag sakate hai
 
 
 Overall my rating for this film is - 3 stars

 shina bora murder cese kii jaanch main juty police ke haath kai ahm saboot lage hai
 The case started in the trap of relationships, when the Mumbai police commissioner Rakesh Maria gets an anonymous call in the first week of June
 phone karne vaali ek ladki thi, ye ladki shaayad shina kii dost thi
 She tells Rakesh Maria on the phone that a girl named Sheena Bora has been murdered three years ago and she is not suspicious but is sure that her mother Indrani Mukherjee was murdered
 vah ye bhi bataati he ki indrani mukherjee ke pati kaa naam peter mukherjee he jo ek bade aadmi hai
 Not only this, Voindrani also tells the address of Mukherjee's house
 iske baad vah phone kaat detii he
 Investigated to the most trusted partner, Rakesh Maria, after hearing this news, first asks the Khar police station for information about a girl named Sheena, but there was no news of any such incident in the police station three years ago
 rakesh maaria ko ab tak yakeen ho chalaa tha ki phone karne vaali sach kah rahi he
 After this, he entrusted his most trusted inspector Dinesh Kadam to investigate the matter but with the instruction that no one should be aware of such an investigation
 dinesh kadam ne sabase pehle gupachup tareeke se indrani mukherjee or peter mukherjee ke bare main jaankaree ikatthi kerani shuru kii
 After a thorough investigation about Indrani's house in Worli's house, he came to know that a girl named Sheena, who is Indrani's sister, used to visit the house often but for the last three years, she has no knowledge
 aise pataa chalaa driver kaa conectiondinesh kadam or unki team is tareeke se maamle kii tafteesh kar rahi thi ki mukherjee parivaar ko jaraa bhi shaq na ho lekin parivaar yaa parivaar ke jaanane waalon se baat kiye bina sachai pataa lagaana mushkil tha
 After this, during investigation, it was found that a few years ago a driver named Shyamvar Rai used to drive Indrani's car
 police ne kisi tarahashyamvar ko dhund nikaala
 After that, he was constantly chased, as well as putting his mobile on surveillance, but with both these things the case was not moving forward
 aakhir main police ne faisla kiya ki shyamvar ko giraftaar kiya jaae lekin khatra ek tha, jis vakt shyamvar kii nigaraanee kii ja rahi thi tab indrani mukherjee desh ke baahar thim
 The police suspected that he might not return to the country after receiving news of Rai's arrest
 isiilie police ne indrani ke desh lautne kaa intjaar karne kaa faisla kiya
 Because the matter was high profile, Maria did not want to take any risk, so he transferred his most trusted inspector Dinesh Kadam to the Khar police station during this time
 saath hi duusare bharosemand senior inspector datate bhargude ko bhi khaar police stesan bhej diya
 Apart from this, he also added his trusted ACP Sanjay Kadam to Khar police station
 ye teenon afasar shuruaati daur se hi rakesh ke maaria ke saath rahe hai or yahaan tak ki 26 / 11 kii jaanch main bhi shaamil rahe hai
 Hearing this, the driver blurted out the truth of murder
 Indrani returned to Mumbai
 khabar milte hi police shyamvar raay ko uthaa leti he
 The arrest is shown under the Arms Act
 iske baad usase poochtacha hoti he
 He is scared that even Sanjay Dutt in the Arms Act does not survive going to jail, so tell the truth of Sheena's murder
 police kii sakhti ke aage raay jald hi tut jaataa he or phir wo 24 april 2012 kii sari kahani ugal detaa he
 His statement to the police was still not sure
 rakesh maaria sirf driver ke bayaan par indrani mukherjee ko giraftaar karne kaa risk nahin lenaa chaahate the lihaaja sabase pehle raay ke bayaan kii tasdik karne kaa faisla liya
 After this, Shyamvar Rai was taken to that forest in Raigad where he had talked about burning and burying Sheena's corpse
 raay kii bataai jagah se police ko kuch insaani haddiyaan milti hai
 After this, it is also known from Raigad police that on 23 May 2012, a woman was found burnt and in a bad condition from the same place
 aakhirkaar giraftaar ho gai indraniinsaani haddiyaan, raigarh police ke bayaan or raay ke kaboolname ke baavjood police ab bhi indrani mukherjee par haath nahin daalana chaahati thi use kuch or sabooton kii talash thi or aakhirkaar ye saboot mili shyamvar raay, indrani mukherjee or sanjeev khanna ke 24 april 2012 ke phone lokation se
 All the episodes were connected and the police had found important evidence
 isi ke baad maaria ne apni team ko indrani mukherjee ko giraftaar karne kii hari jhandi de di or aakhirkaar 25 agast ko indrani mukherjee ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 On 25 August 2015, FIR was registered in Sheena Murder Case at Khar Police Station in Mumbai at 1:40 pm
 exiaar ke mutabik, is cese kaa shikayatakarta ganesh dalvi naam kaa ek shaks he
 The number of this FIR is 406 / 15
 exiaar ke mutabik, shina kaa katl mangalvaar 24 april 2012 ko shaam 6:30 se 7:30 baje ke bich bandra neshnal college se ek kilometre kii duuri par hua
 The FIR also names Indrani Murkhji's driver Shyamawar Rai, Indrani Mukherjee and Sanjeev Khanna as accused
 in teenon ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 120 bi yani sajeesh karnaa, dhara 364 yani kisi ko agava karnaa, dhara 302 kisi ko jaan se maarna or dhara 201 (saboot mitaanaa) ke tahat mukadmaa darj kiya gaya he
 Friday was the most important day in the three accused murder cases of face-to-face murder
 is cese se judaa har ahm kirdaar police ke saamne tha
 These included the three main murder accused Indrani Mukherjee, Sanjeev Khanna and Shyam Rai, besides Sheena's brother Mikhail and Indrani's husband Peter Mukherjee
 cese se jude chathe kirdaar rahul se police pehle hi do charnon main lagbhag 15 ghante poochtacha kar chuki he
 The action started on Friday with Sanjeev Khanna, who was brought from Kolkata to Mumbai late on Thursday and then presented in a Mumbai court on Friday
 adaalat main peshi ke baad sanjeev khanna ko bandra police stesan le jaaya gaya
 Indrani and Shyam Rai were taken from Khar police station to Bandrapolis station as soon as Sanjeev reached the police station
 ye pehla mauka tha jab shina ke katl ke teenon aaropee aamane-saamne the
 By evening, the entire focus shifted from Bandra Police Station to Khar Police Station
 police kamishnar rakesh maaria sabase pehle khaar police stesan pahunchate hai
 Not long after his arrival, Peter Mukherjee arrives
 peter mukherjee ke peeche-peeche mikhail aa gaya
 Apart from Rahul, every character of the case was present in front of the police and after this, the police questioned every person related to the Sheena Murder Case
 in sawaalon ke jawaab talash rahi he pulicephilhal mumbai police ye pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahi he ki aakhir shina rder cese main sanjeev khanna kaa makasad kya tha? jab donon main talaak ho chukaa tha to phir sanjeev khanna ne shina ke katl main indrani kii madad kyon kii? kya shina ko qatl karne se pehle indrani ne koi sajeesh rachi thi? kya sanjeev khanna ko indrani kii pehali shaadi ke bare main pataa tha? kya use ye pataa tha ki indrani kii pehali shaadi se uske do bachche bhi hai?sutron ke mutabik, sanjeev khanna police kii poochtacha main ye baat kabool kar chukaa he ki jis din shina kaa katl hua tha wo mumbai main maujuud tha
 Though she and Indrani were divorced, there was a frequent conversation between the two and the biggest reason for this was the daughter of both of them, Vidhi, who lives with her mother
 kya sanjeev ko vaaki nahin pataa thi ye baat?police sutron ke mutabik, sanjeev khanna police ko ye bataa chukaa he ki indrani hameshaa apane paas do bacchon kii photo rakhaa karti thi or poochne par jawaab diya karti thi ki ye donon uske chote bhai-bahan hai
 If Sanjeev Khanna is telling the truth, then it means that Sanjeev Khanna himself did not know that Sheena, who is the sister of Voindrani, realizes that she is actually Indrani's daughter
 yani indrani mukherjee ne apane duusare pati sanjeev khanna se bhi apni pehali shaadi or do bacchon kaa sach chipa kar rakhaa tha
 Currently Sanjeev Khanna is on remand of Mumbai Police till 31 August
