 party chif raaj thakare ne somvaar ko bataaya he ki unki party maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ladane ja rahi he
 After meeting with party leaders in Mumbai on Monday, Raj Thackeray held a press conference and announced to contest the election
 raaj thakare ne maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa karte hue kaha ki ham ladenge or jeetenge
 However, he did not say how many seats MNS would contest
 sutron ke mutabik, manase kareeb 100 vidhansabha siton par chunaav lard sakati he
 It is also being told that MNS can soon release the list of candidates
 namakan kii aakhri taarikh 4 oktober he, lihaaja manase kii suchi jald hi saamne aa sakati he
 The first list of Congress that came on Sunday has been announced after the first list of Congress, which is very important for political discussions
 darasal, do maheene pehle hi raaj thakare necongress adhyaksh sonia gandhise mulaakaat kii thi
 After the meeting of the two leaders, the possibilities of alliance were also discussed everywhere
 lekin do hafte pehle jab congress kii sabase badi sahyogi ensipi ke adhyaksh sharad pavaar ne 125-125 siton par ladane kaa elaan kiya to manase se judi charchaaon kaa rukh badal gaya
 Out of the two allies, the Congress has released a list of 51 candidates
 ensipi ne abhi tak apana koi bhi ummidavaar ghoshit nahin kiya he
 In such a situation, it can be assumed that just before the last date of nomination (4 October), Raj Thackeray has almost put an end to the coalition discussions with the announcement of contesting the assembly elections
 haalanki, raaj thakare kis formule ke saath chunaav main utrenge, yah jaankaree abhi nahin he
 Let us tell you that in 2014, Raj Thackeray's party MNS contested about 2800 seats in Maharashtra Assembly for about 125 seats
 party kaa pradarshan behad kharaab rahaa tha or vah mahaj ek seat (junar) jeet pai thi
 Amidst the hunt for a new coach for the Indian hockey team, former captain Jude Felix has stated that he is interested in joining the Indian team provided he gets an offer as a professional coach
 felics ne kaha, mujhe abhi tak koi peshkash nahin mili he
 i have read my name in media reports
 lekin yadi koi peshkash milti he, to main nishchit taur par us par gaur karuunga
 Felix, who was the captain of India in the Sydney World Cup 1994, settled in Singapore in 1995
 vah singapore ricriation club se bataur khilaadi coach jude or johor bahru lig ke sutaradhar bane
 The former center half of Bengaluru said that coaching is his profession and also a means of livelihood, so he will decide the future only after taking this into consideration
 unhone kaha, mujhe singapore main acchhee tankhwaah mil rahi he
 i want to contribute for Indian hockey, but also keep in mind that coaching is my profession
 bharat aane ke liye mujhe singapore main naukari chhodani hogi, lihaaja main prastaav milane par kai pahaluon par gaur karke faisla lenaa chaahunga
 Felix, however, said that unless an offer is received, it is too early to say anything about it
 aisi atakalein hai ki mukhya coach ke rup main holland ke rolland oltman bhartiya team se jud sakate hai, jabaki felics rashtriya coach honge
 Asked about this, Pargat Singh, chairman of the five-member committee set up to find a new coach, said that this time a detailed coaching staff would be appointed, which would include Indian coaches along with foreigners
 unhone koi naam lene se inkaar karte hue kaha, do-teen sheersh kochon se baat chal rahi he
 Apart from him, an Indian coach can also accompany him
 jahaan tak jud kii baat he, to maine uske saath hockey kheli he or uskaa anubhav upyogi hoga, lekin kochon kii niyukti ke bare main tasviir agle kuch din main hi spasht ho sakegi
 When asked if the foreign coach has a solution to the problems of the Indian hockey team, Felix replied yes
 unhone kaha, videshi coach acha vikalp he, lekin dekhnaa yah hoga ki kiski sevaayen lee ja rahi hai
 Oltman is a big name and also a good coach
 videshi coach ke naam par kisi ko bhi niyukt kar dena sahi faisla nahin hoga
 The coach's attitude should also be kept in mind, as India's previous experience has not been good
 felics ne yah bhi kaha ki mauka milane par unhen oltman ke saath kaam karne main koi aitraaj nahin hoga

 centre sarkaar ke dwaara kharif kii fasalon ke nunatam samarthan main badhotaree kii gai he
 It is being said as a big decision by the government, while many experts have also given their opinion
 CRISIL ke chif iconomist dharmakirti joshi ne is faisle ko samajhaayaa
 He said that this year the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Kharif crops has been fixed at 50-97 per cent more than the actual price of the crops and the farmer's hard work formula and this is 4-52 per cent higher than the previous year
 vahiin sarkaar dwaara pichley saal kharidi gai fasal ke aadhaar par ausat emspi main vruddhi lagbhag 13 fisadi he
 If it is assumed that the government is going to buy the same crop this year as it was purchased last year, then the increase in MSP will have an impact of Rs 11,500 crore on the treasury of the central government
 haalanki emspi main vruddhi kaa vaastavik asar kendra sarkaar par isse adhik padane kii ummid he kyonki is saal sarkaar pichley saal se adhik fasal kharid karne ke liye taiyaar he
 At the same time, where there will be no purchase of the crop, a provision can be made to give the difference between the MSP and the actual price (price in the market) of the crop to the farmer
 maujuuda samay main zyaadaatar fasalon kii mandi main keemat ghoshnaa kii gai emspi se kam he
 Swaminathan had also welcomed
 Let me tell you that earlier, agricultural scientist MS Swaminathan welcomed the decision of the Central Government to increase the minimum support price (MSP) of Kharif crops by one and a half times the cost, but said that which recommended It was less than that
 swaminathan ne emspi badhaane ke faisle kaa swaagat karte hue kaha ki sarkaar ko kharid or bhandaaran kaa uchit prabandh karnaa chahie
 He said, "the government has taken steps to improve crop insurance, but the coverage and performance still cannot be called satisfactory, and because of this there is a risk of high value addition and demand for easy credit
" 'gauratlab he ki dhan kii emspi main 200 rupee prati quintal kii record vruddhi kii gai, jabaki anya kharif fasalon ke emspi main 52 pratishat tak kii vruddhi kar di gai he
 This step of the government may increase the burden of food subsidy to cross Rs 2 lakh crore and its impact can also come as inflation increases

 is agnikand main kisi ke ghayal hone kii khabar nahin he lekin nuksaan kaafii bada ho saktaa he
 a former Australian diplomat has argued that selling uranium to India is causing more harm than good
 rajanyik kaa tark he ki haalanki is bikri se kuch had tak niryaat rajasav badhegaa, lekin isse japan or dakshin korea jaise deshon ko sanket jayega ki cenbra aprasar sandhi ko maanane ke prati gambhir nahin he
 Richard Broinowski, a former University of Sydney professor and diplomat in Vietnam, Korea and Mexico, believes that the sale of uranium may encourage other countries to develop nuclear weapons
 unhone kaha, ‘bharat ko uranium kii bikri ke bare main ek tathy yah bhi he ki isse pehle hi parmaanu aprasar sandhi (enpiti) or aprasar ko nuksaan pahunch chukaa he
 It is also responsible for the sale of uranium to Australia
 ’broinovski ne kaha ki uranium kii is bikri se australia ke niryaat rajasav main bahut thodaa hi ijapha hua he
 This also explains why the Australian Uranium Association supports the government's policy of not selling uranium to countries not signing NPT
 broinovski ne kaha, ‘agar australia bharat kii maujuuda maang ke paanchaven hisse kii bhi aapurti karata he, to isse hamaare niryaat main maatr 1
 There will be an increase of 8 percent
 yahaan tak ki agar bharat ke sabhi nirmaanadhin riektaron kii maang ko bhi mila len, to bhi australia kaa rajasav niryaat sirf 10 fisadi badhegaa
 The Australian diplomat wrote in The Age, "there are only a few countries that are doing nuclear trade with countries that refuse to sign the NPT
" ’ It has been a month for demonetisation
 is dauraan kai tarah ke graph bade
 The graph of people's troubles, moderation, patriotism as well as the increasing trend of e-payment also increased considerably
 sarkaar chaahati he ki notebandi ke baad log digital bhugtan kii vibhinn sevaaon kaa laabh uthaakar naa keval nakadi ke sankat se nipten balki digitaly agucated hokar duniya ke saath kadam milakar chalem
 That is, we proceeded towards cashless system
 taaki koi unki mehnat kii kamai main naa to send laga paye or naa hi kisi tarah kii gadabad kar sake
 Pie pie can be kept transparently
 har tranjection naa keval computer main darj rahe balki ek clic par puraa statement ankhon ke aage aa jaye
 If the government presented many such figures of the increasing popularity of campaigns run under Nedigital India, then it became clear that yes, only in this time of trouble, the right people read the text of e-payment through the most secure, transparent and simple transaction
 Took it saath hi is bare main naye sabak bhi yaad kar liye
 IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, while initiating the Digidhan campaign, said that if we take E-wallet, before November 8, there were 17 lakh daily transactions in it
 lekin thik ek maheene ke dauraan hi saat disambar ko iskaa tranjection lagbhag chaar guna badhkar 64 lakh pratidin ho gaya he
 That is, from the transaction of Rs 52 crore daily, business of daily Rs 191 crore now started
 aankade chaukaaney vaale to or bhi hai
 That is to say, Rupe card, till November 8
 85 lakh tranjection rojaanaa hote the
 Now, on December 7, 16 lakh transactions have increased by 503 percent
 yani rojaanaa kaa kul lenden 39
 From Rs 17 crores to Rs 236 crores daily
 isamen din par din lagaataar ijapha jari he
 In light of the figures, the government's e-payment app UPI has also increased from 3721 transactions daily to 48,238 transactions daily
 yani 1196 fisadi kaa record ijapha
 Daily where 1
 93 karod rupee kaa lenden iske jariye hota tha ab ye 15 karod rupee rojaanaa ho gaya he
 Prasad said that it is the specialty of India that people first try to see new technology with curiosity
 phir uskaa istemaal karte hai
 After this, they enjoy it, then the same technique becomes an important part of their life
 yani pehle istemaal phir vishwaas
 USSD also had an average business of 97 per day as of November 8
 ab ye 1263 pratidin he
 That is, it has jumped from one lakh to 14 lakh rupees daily
 prasad ne bharosa dilaayaa ki ye to janata ko digital raah par chalaane kii shuruyaat he
 Many more campaigns are yet to be done and the security of the hard earned money of the people has to be strengthened as well as the economy of the country

 After all the efforts of the alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress in Delhi have failed, now the leaders of both parties are exposing each other in the election campaign
 aam aadmi party ke rashtriya sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne gathbandhan ko lekar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii niyat par sawaal uthaae the, jiske jawaab main ab rahul ne khud gathbandhan na hone kii vajah bataai
 Also, Rahul Gandhi also reminded Arvind Kejriwal of 2014
 somvaar ko dilli ke chandani chowk main jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue rahul gandhi ne dilli ke maujuuda mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party sanyojak arvind kejariwal par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki unhen is baat par vichaar karnaa chahie ki 2014 main congress ke bare main kisne jhooth bolaa or bhaajapa ke liye darwaja khol diya
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi said, 'kejriwal should consider who opened the door for BJP (who gave the party a chance to make an impact), who lied about the Congress? This was not done by BJP alone '
 gathbandhan par bhi kejariwal ko javabam aadmi party se congress kaa gathbandhan na hone kii vajah bhi rahul gandhi ne bataai
 Rahul said, 'I told him (to Kejriwal) that we should win all the seven seats in Delhi
 maine unase kaha ki aap chaar seat par laden, teen par congress ladegi
 At first they said, OK
 jaise hi maine ise manjuuri di, unhone haryana or punjab kii baat uthaa di
 This is where the alliance broke
 chandani chowk se congress pratyaashee jai prakaash agarwal ke liye vot kii apil karte hue rahul gandhi ne logon se is ba par vichaar karne ke liye kaha ki koun party puure desh main bhaajapa ko kadi chunauti de rahi he
 Rahul said, 'wherever Modi went, we, the Congress, faced him everywhere
 hamane unhen kai rajyon main haraaya
 If any party in India can stop BJP then it is Congress
 yah vichaardhaaraon kii ladaai he
 i am guaranteeing to you that the Congress will defeat the BJP '
 haalanki, arvind kejariwal daawey kar rahe hai ki dilli main bijepi ko sirf aam aadmi party hi haraa sakati he
 Therefore, people should not distribute their votes by voting for Congress
 vahiin, kejariwal ne gathbandhan na hone ke liye rahul kii niyat par sawaal uthaae the
 However, after the absence of an alliance, the two parties are now facing each other

 On September 21, Holland told the French news portal mediapart that the Indian government had proposed the name of the Anil Ambani group as an industrial partner
 unka yah bayaan modi sarkaar ke daawey ke vipareet he, jo vah ab tak kahati rahi he
 Hollande's statement goes against the Modi government's claim that it has nothing to do with Anil Ambani's presence in the deal
 iske mahaj teen hi din pehle raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne media se kaha tha, "maine unka yaa kisi kaa bhi naam sarkaron ke bich hue is samjhaute main nahin rakhaa or na hi main ek kaarobaari company ko samjhaute main shaamil hone ke liye kah sakati hum
 He reiterated the government's stance that it has held since November 2017 when Congress made Rafael a loud issue
 is saude ne ab donon deshon kii sarkaar ko sharmindagi or pareshaani main daalane kii gambhir sambhaavnaaen paidaa kar di hai
 When asked about Hollande's statement on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, French President Emanuel Macron spoke of "clear rules" in the "government-to-government Discussion" and also said that the agreement was more between the two countries Being part of a wider military and defense alliance

 The opposition Congress is blaming the Modi government, accusing it of corruption, nepotism, leader-trader nexus or crony capitalism and increasing the price greatly by buying Rafale aircraft and demanding a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to investigate it

 The Congress says it negotiated on December 12, 2012 to buy an aircraft for Rs 526 crore, while according to the 2016 report of Dasso Aviation Company, the NDA was buying them for Rs 1,671 crore per aircraft
 is tarah congress kaa kahana he ki kareeb 300 fisadi zyada daam par yah sauda kiya gaya he
 The NDA says it has paid 670 crore rupees per Rafale, although this price does not include "the cost of equipment, weapons, enhancements, maintenance assistance and services made specifically for India", as Minister of State for Defense Subhash Bhamre told the Lok Sabha on 18 November 2016

 How did Reliance, a company with no prior defense experience, come into the deal? The presence of industrialist Anil Ambani has led the opposition to accuse the government of politician-business nexus and nepotism in the deal
 congress kii daleel he ki reliance anil dhirubhai ambani group (adieji) ke chairman raksha kaarobaar main nae aae hai or unhen "vimaan banane kaa pehle koi tajurba nahin'' he or saarvajanik kshetra ke pratishthit udhyam hindustan aronutics limited (echeel) ko darkinar karke unhen yah theka diya gaya he
 Anil Ambani's image for the Congress matches well with Rahul Gandhi's "suit boot ki sarkar"

 Anil Ambani's company was registered in Paris just 12 days before the Prime Minister's announcement, a fact that adds fuel to the fire of Hollande's September 21 statement
 unhone ofaset partner ke taur par reliance samooh ke chayan ke bare main mediapart se kaha, "is maamle main hamaari baat kaa koi vajan nahin tha
 It was the Government of India that offered the group and Dasso talked to Ambani

 unhone kaha, reliance samooh rafel kii kharid ke us "nae formule'' ke hisse ke taur par aayaa, jo "kaman sanbhaalane ke baad modi sarkaar ne tay kiya tha
 At the same time, an officer of Reliance Defense says that there is no connection between the formation of the company in March 2015 and the Prime Minister's visit
 unhone kaha, "vimaan ke qaraar par dastakhat sitambar 2016 main kiye gaye, tab raksha kaarobaar main daakhil hone ke reliance ke faisle ko 21 maheene or reliance dephence ko company bane 18 maheene ho chuke the

 While the Janata Dal (united) has fielded eminent doctor Gopal Prasad Sinha from this seat in the election season, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has made the contest interesting by standing up to former Bihar minister Parveen Amanullah
 star waar se prasiddh ho chuki is seat par sabhi pratyaashee jamkar chunaav prachaar kar rahe hai

 In the last assembly election, four of these six assembly constituencies were captured by the JD (U) BJP alliance

 On the other hand, Parveen Amanullah, who was engaged in the election campaign, is also roaming around, claiming his victory
 ve kahati hai ki do film abhinaytaon ke chunavi maidan main aane se meri raah aasaan ho gai he
 Actors neither go among people nor listen to their problems
 baharhaal, star pratyaashiyon vaale patna sahib sansadeey kshetra main star ke saath-saath netaa bhi chunavi maidan main hai
 In such a situation, whom will the local voters support, it will be known only after the result of the election

 Describing the Shiv Sena as an effective organization in India, Headley said that killing Thackeray would have been a stupid move and doing so would have been like killing a chicken-laying hen
 darasal, lashkar ke apane saathiyon ke saath baatcheet ke dauraan hedli ne thakare kii hatya ke bare main yah majaak kiya tha
 During the hearing against another suspected terrorist of Pakistani origin Tahawwur Hussain Rana, Headley was asked by the lawyer, "do Lashkarians joke about killing people?" In response to this question, Headley said, yes

 They kill people and even joke about it

 Headley said that the ISI used the video of Thackeray's statement saying that the US was hospitable to the terrorists
 vakil ne poocha, jab jab tum log itani koshish is aadmi ko yahaan tak laane ke liye kar rahe the to kya tum log unki hatya nahin karte? hedli ne kaha, nahin, agar aisa main chahta bhi to ise anjaam dena mukhartapurna kadam hota
 It would have been foolish to bring someone here after spending money and then kill him

 dollar ke mukaable rupee main lagaataar giravat jari he
 72 in comparison to Monday 67 ke str tak pahunch gaya tha
 Talking about Tuesday, the rupee is still open beyond 72 today
 girte rupee ko sanbhaalane ke liye centre sarkaar ab enarai bonds bechney kii yojana bana rahi he
 On Monday, two Finance Ministry officials pointed this out
 unhone sanket diya ki sarkaar rupee ko sahaara dene ke liye enarai bonds or diposit skims laa sakati he
 What are NRI bonds? Non-resident bonds or NRI bonds are foreign currency deposits
 ye diposits videshon main rah rahe apravasi bharatiyon ke jariye jutai jaati hai
 In return for these deposits, they are given higher interest than the domestic level
 adhiktar samay in diposits ke liye 3 se 5 saal kaa lock-in peried hota he
 Not only this, RBI is also guaranteed on these deposits
 abhi saaf nahin he rukhhaalanki abhi sarkaar neenaraibonds ko lekar koi spasht jaankaree nahin di he
 The government has not yet told what terms and conditions will be there if it brings NRI bonds
 aise sahaara dete hai nrilekina ateet main bhi enarai bonds kaa sahaara liya gaya he
 The NRI Bond Scheme was introduced by the central government in 2013
 is dauraan videshon main oparate karne vaale bhartiya bainkon ne apravasi bharatiyon ko apane dollar diposit karne ke liye protsaahit kiya
 The deposited dollars on behalf of nris are sent to banks in Indian branches
 isse girte rupee ko sahaara miltaa he
 What do nris get? Whenever a NRI deposits a dollar in a foreign branch of a domestic bank
 to iske badale use gharelu str se zyada byaaj diya jaataa he
 Along with this, they also get a chance to convert their dollars in the country to rupees
 haalanki aisi zyaadaatar skim main 3 se 5 saal kaa lock-in peried hota he
 This means that they will not be able to withdraw deposits for so many years

 abhi isi 18 farvari ko 66 varshiya major archbishap jorge ellencheri ko vatican main pope benedict 16wein ne ek sade samaaroh main cardinal kaa darja diya tha
 With this, Eleanchery, the head of the syro-malabar Catholic Church of India's largest and most heavily-paid Kerala, became part of the elite group of 213 cardinals to elect the 84-year-old pope's successor
 lekin iske teen din baad hi ellencheri or 37 lakh sadasyon vaale unke carch par gambhir aarope lag gaye hai
 The question is whether he is more loyal to his country and people or to Italy? In an interview given in Rome to the Vatican's official news agency, Agendia Fides, there has been a ruckus about his comments
 unhone kerala ke tatavarti ilaake main do bhartiya machuaaron ko italvi tel tanker par savaar suraksha balon ke kathith taur par goli maarane ke sambandh main bayaan diya tha
 The incident took place on February 16 and the tanker was named Enrica Lexi
 intervyuu main ellencheri ne kaha tha, ‘main kerala ke catholic mantriyon ke sampark main hum or rahoonga
 i hope they will try to normalize the situation
 mujhe khaskar paryaton mantri catholic ke

 ’ agency ne ellencheri ke hawaale se bataaya, ‘catholic machuaaron ke maare jane kii soochna mujhe mili
 this is very sad
 maine turant kerala ke catholic mantriyon se sampark karke kaha ki sarkaar jaldbaaji main koi karrwai na kare
 However, some mistakes also occurred in this case
 machuaaron ko samudri dakait maan liya gaya tha, lekin yahaan maamla doosraa he
 It seems that the opposition party wants to take advantage of this situation and exploit it for electoral purposes in the name of 'western forces' and 'american supremacy'

 The archbishop's alleged statements have created a ruckus because most fishermen in Kerala - including two killed fishermen - are part of the Latin Catholic Church

 The state police have arrested both the sailors for the murder and also seized the ship
 italy ke adhikariyon ne iskaa virodh karte hue kaha he ki aropiyon par mukadmaa antarrashtriya kanoon ke tahat hi chalaaya ja saktaa he

 The minister said that he will also regret the family of the fishermen killed in Kerala
 baithak main maujuud ek adhikari ke mutabik, mixtura ne kaha ki donon aropiyon par italy ke yaa antarrashtriya kanoon ke aadhaar par mukadmaa chalaaya janaa chahie
 Kaur responded to this by telling them that both would be tried under Indian law
 cor ne media ko bataaya, ‘kanoon ke maamle main unki apni vyakhyaayein hai or hamaari apni

 ellencheri ke bayaan par mache ho-halle ke baad catholic bishap conference of india (sibisiai) or siro-malabar carch ne jaldbaaji main ek bayaan jari kar kaha ki cardinal kii baat ko tod-marod kar pesh kiya gaya he
 Father Paul Thelakat, spokesperson of the syro-malabar Church, told Tafsil, "the cardinal only said that the matter should be resolved without disturbing the relations between India and Italy
" aakhir ve aisa kaise kah sakate hai jab maare gaye garib machuaare bhi catholic the?’ lekin nuksaan to ho chukaa he
 According to Thelakat, the cardinals wanted to deal with it peacefully as they anticipated how the incident would affect the Indians living and working in Italy
 unhone bataaya, ‘cardinal ne mujhase kaha tha ki unhone is masale par kisi mantri se baat nahin kii, na hi ve kanoonee prakriya main koi adnga daalane kii manshaa rakhte the
 The Chief Minister of Kerala has also said that none of his ministers was involved in mediation on this issue
 chandi ne kaha, ‘italvi jahaaj dal kii rakhi gai tamaam daleelein hamen manjuur nahin hai
 We will go to any extent to punish those who have killed our citizens
 main tippanee nahin karnaa chahta
 Since the syro-malabar Church itself stated that the Cardinal's remarks were distorted, there is no need to comment

 Leader of the Opposition V
 es
 Achuthanandan said that it is unfortunate if the statement of the cardinal is correct
 ‘unhen aise bayaan nahin dene chahie the
 The Cardinal's alleged statements have also angered the Latin Catholic Church
 iske khilaaf kollam diosij ke sadasyon ne pradarshan bhi kiya
 Fearing division in the Catholic community, the Chief Archbishop of the Latin Catholic Church, Dr
 suusaipakyam ne turant dakhal dete hue kaha ki cardinal aisa rashtravirohi bayaan de hi nahin sakate
 'certainly his statement has been misunderstood
 yah niraashaa kii baat he ki kuch log is vivaad main pope or vatican ko anaavashyak taur par khinch rahe hai jinke apane hit hai
 On the other hand, the Kerala Fishermen's Federation said in a statement, "it is very unfortunate that the people of Kerala themselves are defending those of Italy who have shot their own people

 The Prime Minister is in his own cabinet

 in donon cricketron kii tulana karne kii kuch visheshgyon kii aadat ke bare main jab poocha gaya, to gavaskar isse bilkul bhi prabhavit nahin dikhe
 Looking angered, Gavaskar said to Aaj Tak, 'nobody should be compared to Kapil Dev

 aap vanade cricket main aise shot khilne ke baavjood batch sakate ho, kyonki kaaphi slip nahin hoti or balle kaa kinaaraa lekar gend slip kshetra se boundry tak ja sakati he
 Gavaskar said, "but in Tests, the result of such a shot would be to lose wickets only
" khilaadi jab tak maansik rup se badlaav nahin karata, tab tak videshon main laal gend ke khilaaf use jujhna hoga
 He said, 'I (cheteshwar) will feed another batsman at Lord's as Pujara
 uske paas test match ke liye jaruri takanic or dhairya he
 Who he replaces will depend on the pitch

 For this promotion, she uploads videos on social media every other day
 apane condom ke pehle graahak ke taur par raakhi ne newlived kapal viraat-anoushka ko chunaa he
 Is the decision to discontinue condom ads a conspiracy against Rakhi Sawant? She wants Virushka to be her first customer
 itnaa hi nahin item girl raakhi saavant yah bhi chaahati hai ki ve apana anubhav bhi share kare
 He has expressed this strange request to Virushka through a video on Instagram
 a post shared by Rakhi Sawant Official (@rakhisawant2511)ondec 22, 2017 at 11:43pm pstraki saamvat yaheen nahin ruki
 He has challenged Baba Ramdev by sharing another video
 kaha ki ramdev bhi patanjali condom banaae or unke brands ko compitishan de
 Now it has to be seen whether Ramdev also answers the drama of Queen Rakhi
 lekin itnaa jarur he ki raakhi ke condom brands ko acchhee khaasi publicity mil gai he

 raakhi saavant ko saport, nan banakar condom kaa aid karnaa chaahati hai sophia hayattunhone kaha, agar tivi channels sarkaar ke nirdeshon kaa paalan karenge to bharat main har kisi ko aids ho jayega
 Children will fall asleep and they will not know what a condom is and what it is used for
 jab bachche is aid ko nahin dekhenge to vah kaise ehtiyaat baratenge
 If it is not right for TV, then it should be edited or censored
 haalanki is twit ko baad main of spinner harbhajan singh ne delit kar diya
 NDTV does not even confirm its veracity, but since the news of this has come, a legitimate question has definitely arisen

 It seems reasonable to ask where Karun Nair is
 
 And where is the focus of the selectors? aakhir chayankartaaon ne kyon bhavishya kii baat karte karte aise khilaadi ko nazarandaaz kar diya or peeche mudakar puraane khilaadiyon par kyon chale gaye
 Senior players like Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ashish Nehra have returned to the team against England
 tippaniyan Significantly, Yuvraj has not played any ODI for 3 years since December 2013, so he has been out of the T20 team since the World Cup, the reason for his return to the team was told in the performance in the domestic Ranji Trophy
 Then is Karun Nair's international performance not worth it
 vahiin suresh raina dedh saal se bhartiya team se baahar rahe hai
 
 or ashish nehra bhi tii20 world cap ke baad vaapasi kar rahe hai
 The big question is if the selectors are eyeing the ICC Champions Trophy
 
 So do we really have the hopes of winning these players who are included in the team before the big tournament
 
 Then what will happen to the youth who are constantly making a splash in domestic cricket

 Those who are more vulnerable should be empowered first

 He said, 'we want to empower women
 isiilie ham bhartiya vidhayika main mahila aarakshan ke virdohi nahin hai

 Today, the world knows the fact that the TMC government does not engage in projects where the syndicate does not have a share and where there is no rubbing

 Congratulations to the people of West Bengal for this magnificent budget, what is the development of all, is seen in this budget
 desh main ek maang uth rahi thi ki 5 lakh kii aay ko tex se mukt kiya jaae
 The Modi government has done the job to fulfill this demand
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ke is ek faisle se desh ke 3 karod logon ko phayda hoga
 The youth will be the biggest beneficiaries of this, who are going to start their careers
 sirf tex nahin balki desh kii janata ko anya kai yojanaon kii saugat di gai, bina tex kii chintaa ke aap apana doosraa ghar kharid paaenge

 Under which every year 6 thousand rupees will be directly transferred to their account

 If we wanted, we could declare loan waiver for the farmers
 jaisaa saal 2008 main congress ne kiya tha, lekin hamaari niti or niyat saaf he
 Therefore, started such a scheme, which continues to benefit from the future

 The Prime Minister also referred to the Citizenship (amendment) Bill demanding citizenship of non-muslim minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who had fled their country due to religious persecution
 anusuchit jati matua samudaay ke kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue modi ne kaha, ‘‘ab main samaj saktaa hum ki kyon didi (banerjee) or unki party hinsa, nirdosh logon kii hatya main shaamil he
 She is terrified by your love for us
 'kisaanon, kaamkaaji or madhyam varg ke kalyaan ke liye shuukravaar ko pesh kiye bajet ko ‘‘aitihaasik kadam'' bataate hue unhone kaha ki aazaadee ke baad in virgon ko varshon tak nazarandaaj kiya gaya

 An expenditure of 75 thousand crore rupees is estimated in this year
 10 saal pehle congress sarkaar ne daawa kiya tha ki usne kisaanon kaa 52,000 karod rupye kaa karjmaaf kiya
 With this much money, we too could make a noise of debt, but our intention is clear, which is the result of this Permanent Scheme
 desh kaa sabase shaktishaalee namdaar parivaar bhi tex chori or dhokhajaadi ke cese main adaalaton ke chakkar kaat rahaa he
 People who fled to other countries with money

 Who did not like to see each other's face, who screamed and talked about sending each other to jail
 aaj wo gale mil rahe hai
 Let me give you another example of West Bengal
 centre sarkaar ne real estate par niyantran ke liye rera kanoon banaaya lekin pashchim bengal sarkaar ne ise maanane se inkaar kar diya
 The water that i drink and whipped is abused
 uski ek hi vajah he ki main bhrashtrachaar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaata hum
 Alam is that even the investigating agencies were prevented from entering West Bengal
 mujhe bhi gujarat main 9-9 ghanton tak bithaaya jaataa tha lekin hamane kabhi kisi agency kaa apmaan nahin kiya
 i assure you that i am working day and night to get rid of West Bengal

 trump ne na sirf id-ul-fitar kii shubhakamanaayen di, balki ramajaan shuru hone par bhi muslimon ko badhai di thi
 This move of Trump is considered a shock for the Muslims

 At the time he said that his fight was against terrorism and not Islam
 musalamaanon ke lekar trump aksar vivaadon main rahe hai

 First time since 1996 assembly elections in J&K are not being held on time
 Remember this the next time you are praising PM Modi for his strong leadership
 On the other hand, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and PDP President Mehbooba Mufti said, 'the decision of holding only Lok Sabha elections in Jammu and Kashmir is the crooked thinking of the Government of India'
 unhone twit kiya, ‘janata ko sarkaar nahin chunane dena loktantr ke siddhant ke khilaaf he'
 The Jammu and Kashmir unit of the Congress also alleged on Sunday that assembly elections in the state were postponed due to the Center not handling the situation properly
 pradesh congress adhyaksh ji e mir ne ek bayaan main kaha ki halaat ko lekar centre kii ore se kiye jane vaale bade-bade daavon kii pole khol chuki he
 The Center itself has accepted that the situation is out of control and the atmosphere is not conducive to holding elections simultaneously
 mir ne kaha ki vidhansabha chunaav karakar logon ko ek nirvaachit sarkaar dene kaa centre ke paas ek sunaharaa mauka tha, kyonki sabhi raajnneetik partiyaan ek saath chunaav karaane ke paksh main thim
 Decision to hold only parliamentary elections in J&K confirms sinister designs of goi
 Not letting people elect a government is antithetical to the very idea of democracy
 Also a tactic of buying time to disempower people by pushing an agenda that suits their ulterior motives
 udhar, faruk abdulla ne bhi jammu-kashmir main loksabhaa chunaavon ke saath vidhansabha chunaav na karaane ke faisle par sawaal uthaaye hai
 He said, if the atmosphere is favorable for the Lok Sabha elections, then why not for the assembly elections? BSP supremo Mayawati also targeted the central government for not holding the elections to Jammu and Kashmir along with the Lok Sabha elections
 mayawati ne kaha, ' jammu-kashmir main vidhansabha kaa aamchunaav loksabhaa chunaav ke saath nahin karana shri modi (PM Modi) sarkaar kii kashmir niti kii vifaltaa kaa dyotak he
 The security forces that can conduct Lok Sabha elections, why can't they conduct assembly elections on the same day? The logic of the Center is absurd and bjp's excuse is childish ''
 Denying J&K assembly's simultaneous poll with the Lok Sabha is poor reflection & indicative of Modi Govt's failure of Kashmir policy
 Forces are surely capable of holding poll for both on the same day much to relief of people
 Centre's logic is poor & bjp's excuse is childish

 When and where this new disease was born, it is not known for sure, but there is definitely a difference of opinion about the time of birth of this disease
 kai ise tab shuru hua bataate hai, jab bharat kaa muqabla cricket worldcup ke quarter final main bangladesh se tay hua tha
 Whereas many tell the day India defeated Bangladesh
 matbhed chaahe jitne hon par visheshgyon ke donon dhade is baat par sahamat hai kii beemaari ne worldcup se bangladesh ke nikalate hi vikaraal rup le liya he
 Symptoms of patients suffering from semi-flu are reported to be poor in work, headaches in the name of Australia, watching cricket-based reports on news channels frequently, smiling lightly, looking at the highlights of previous matches
 , Discussing statistics and possibilities repeatedly with another victim and watching the new ed by chance on youtube repeatedly
 jaisaa ki pehle bataaya gaya is beemaari kii chapet main aane ke baad peedit rosemara ke kaam puure karne yogya bhi nahin rah jaataa
 Further reinforcing this notion is the fact that many employees began seeking leave weeks before the workplace

 The same is the case with school-colleges and every place or institution where attendance is mandatory on working days
 ye saaf darshata he ki rog ke badhane ke saath kaaryakshmata bhi ghatati jaati he
 Experts tell that on the twenty-sixth March, the day when the outbreak of semi-flu will be the highest, the victims will not even be able to drink a glass of water

 The same situation is also with Prasad and Verma ji

 Since only the symptoms of the disease have been discovered and the treatment has not been found, the doctors have made it clear that the victims should be allowed to stay at home on the twenty-sixth march

 Diagnosis of the disease in a positive environment will be possible soon

 They should not be given much water so that they do not have to rise again and again in the middle of the match
 semi flu se peedit vyakti ke haath se remote na len, apaat sthiti ke liye inwarter yaa radio kii vyavastha karke rakhen
 Asked 'if India reaches the final after Australia loses, will this disease not return?' The doctors said 'no! No one will get sick then, that day itself is Sunday !! ' atal par janata sarkaar ke anubhav kaa hi prabhaav padaa ki unhone 1980 main bani nai party bijepi ke siddhanton main gandhivadi samaajwaad or sakaaratmak dharmanirpekshata ko shaamil karne par jor diya
 However, the ruling Congress was fast becoming a Hindu party at the time it was taking a more liberal stance unlike its earlier incarnation, the Jana Sangh! Assam, Punjab and Kashmir problem during Indira Gandhi's second term (1980-84) Started raising his head
 indira ke tikhe bayanon (alpsankhyak pasand nahin karte the) or saaf taur par dikhne vaale, jabardast tareeke se mandiron or dharmik guruon ke paas unke jane ke prachaar ne ek hindu netaa kii tasviir pesh kii
 Thus, the roles had changed, with the BJP led by Atal taking a moderate stance, while the Congress led by Indira was taking a right-wing approach to political issues
 atal ko laga ki bijepi se jansangh kaa bhoot utraa nahin he or use dur bhagaanaa hoga, chaahe janata party ke ghoshnaa-patr ko apana bataakar yaa phir udaaravaadi or naap-taulakar die gaye bayanon ke jariye
 a tool used in the Ayodhya movement was not comfortable with and private conversations they have expressed their opposition, but stand for public party
 unke virodh karne ke tareeke anokhe the
 When asked to become the party's leader in the Lok Sabha so that Advani could bear his burden (since he was leading the Ayodhya movement), Atal refused
 sambhawatah unhen iskaa abhas ho chukaa tha ki 6 disambar, 1992 ko ayodhya main kya hone vaala he or is kaaran ve us pavitra nagari se dur hi rahe
 When the disputed structure was demolished, he said it was the saddest day of his life
 unhone aage kaha, "main un car sevakon se saamne aane ko kehane ke liye taiyaar hum, jinaki sankhya mutthi bhar thi or ve sweekaar karenge ki unhone us dhaanche ko giraaya or sajaa bhugat lenge
 i also want to say that there were also a large number of Kar Sevaks who were not involved in the demolition
 yadi chupchaap vidhwans kar dene kaa iraadaa hota to is yojana ke liye car seva kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati
 Nevertheless, we regret what happened there
 ''godhra ke dangon or gujarat rajya prashasan dwaara jis prakaar usase nipta gaya, uske baad atal ke mushkilon bhare din shuru ho gaye
 The manner in which national and international pressure was being created on the Atal government to change the bjp-ruled Gujarat government, Atal suffered a huge embarrassment
 unhone mukhyamantri ko hataane kaa faisla kar liya; lekin adwani ke netritv main party ke kattarpathiyon ke dabaav ke chalate yah sambhav nahin ho sakaa
 Atal had to retreat
 haalanki atal ne ayodhya maamle main behtareen santulan banane main kamyaabi hasil kii
 This was possible despite pressure from the Sangh Parivar on one side and the NDA constituents on the other
 unhone sansad main kaha, "maine vivaadit dhaanche ke sthal par kabhi ram mandir banane kii maang nahin kii
 "the climax of the Ayodhya movement was a moment of pride for Advani
 aisa lag rahaa tha maano ve abhedya sthiti main the or kinare kiye gaye atal kaaphi peeche chhot chuke the
 There was no dearth of people in the saffron party who felt that the fall of Narasimha Rao's government and the Advani-led government coming to power was just a matter of time
 "adwaniji ko ehsaas ho gaya tha ki unke liye bane rahanaa sambhav nahin he or kisi ke kuch kehane se pehle hi unhone jimmedaari atalji ko saunp di,'' yah kahana he jagadish shettigar kaa, jo us vakt party ke aarthik cell ke sanyojak or rashtriya kaaryakarini ke sadsy the
 For this reason, the Ayodhya movement (even if it led to Atal being sidelined) was ultimately in his favor and brought him back into the lead role
 bharat ko parmaanu-hathiyaaron se las deshon ke bich laa khadaa karne vaale parmaanu pareekshanon ke do maheene baad pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne "india today'' ko parmaanu pareekshan par ek intervyuu diya
 "in order to keep the promises made to the people in the elections, we conducted a series of nuclear tests
 yah shashan ke rashtriya agenda kaa ek hissaa he
 i have been advocating for the last four decades to make India a country endowed with nuclear power
 meri party yah maang lagaataar or puri takat se karti rahi he
 Now that we are in government, people want to see the long-standing commitment being converted into action
 hamane unhen dikhaa diya he ki ham jo kehete hai, vah karte hai
 "nuclear tests were carried out between May 11-13, 1998, just two months after Atal came to power on March 19, 1998 as the head of an alliance
" parmaanu pareekshanon ko karaane kaa faisla atal kii ore se uthaae gaye pehle kuch kadamon main se ek tha
 It was not without reason
 pichhali do sarkaron ne logon kaa bharosa hilaakar rakh diya tha
 In such a situation, Atal, who led a thirteen-day government in 1996, wanted his government to give the message that it is a powerful government
 atal kaa mat tha ki yah makasad parmaanu pareekshan se puraa ho gaya, kyonki india today ko die intervyuu main unhone kaha, "lakhon bharatiyon ne is avasar ko ek aatmavishvaas se bhare shaktishaalee bharat ke udai kii shuruyaat ke rup main dekha he
 The tests were conducted in Pokhran, a small town in Rajasthan
 ek lihaaj se pandrah dinon baad bharat kii badhat kuch had tak samaapt ho gai, jab 28 may ko pakistan ne bhi chegai hills main parmaanu pareekshan kiye
 After this, US President Bill Clinton had to say, "two wrong things don't make one right
" ''ittefaq se bharat kii ore se kiye gaye parmaanu pareekshanon ke baad pakistani videsh mantri ne yah kehete hue kathor pratikriya di thi, "bhartiya netritv unmutt ho gaya he or bekaabu tareeke se kaam kar rahaa he
 However, Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said that his country would respond appropriately to Indian trials
 bhartiya jansangh main atal ke guru dinadayal upaadhyaay ne 1960 ke dashak ke madhya main (samaajawaadee netaa ram manohar lohia ke saath milakar) bharat or pakistan ke ek parisangh kii avadharana pesh kii thi
 In a way, this concept contradicted the concept of united India, which was backed by extreme right-wing Hindu organizations and advocated good bi-partisan relations between the two countries, which in many cases could present a united front
 Were
 ek baar bharat ne or phir pakistan ne bhi parmaanu desh kaa darja hasil kar liya, to atal ko laga ki donon deshon ke bich achche sambandhon kii shuruyaat kaa yah sahi samay he
 Atal's counterpart in Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif also wanted to enhance good relations between the two countries
 sharif ne atal ko pakistan aane kaa nyotaa diya
 Pakistan wanted to test the commitment of the new BJP government
 atal ne puure man se iskaa jawaab diya or punjab sthit ataari-wagha bagha border ko 19 farvari, 1999 main bas se paar kiya
 He was welcomed by Nawaz Sharif soon after crossing the border
 atal ne kaha, "dakshin asia ke itihaas main yah ek nirnaayak pal he or hamen is chunauti par khara utarana hoga
 "atal's assistant Sudhindra Kulkarni recalls how Pakistan's Information Minister Mushahid Hussain told him," Vajpayee ji is really encouraged that he came to Pakistan this way at this time
 ''itane saare jhatkon ke baad bhi atal ne bharat or pakistan ke bich shanti ke apane sapane ko nahin choda
 Foreign affairs were very close to his heart and he wanted to leave an indelible mark on india-pakistan relations; However the circumstances were not favorable
 niraash atal ne kumarakom (jahaan vah 2001 kii shuruyaat main nae varsh par kuch samay ke liye tehre the) se apane chintan main likhaa, "bharat kashmir samasya kaa sthaayee hal nikaalane ke liye tatpar or taiyaar he
 We are ready to conduct any level of dialogue with Pakistan again, including at the highest level, provided Islamabad provides sufficient evidence to create a positive atmosphere
 ''is prakaar atal bihari vaajapeyi ke saamne yah uljhan thi ki udaarikaran ke saath aage badhen yaa nahin
 Atal reached a conclusion soon
 udaarikaran ek-tarafa rasta tha
 The extent to which liberalization increased, it could be controlled, but the path taken was clear
 is par aage badaae ke baad peeche hatana yaa lautnaa sambhav nahin tha
 This was not only the demand of the time, but the demand of the country as well and Atal was determined that the process of reform would proceed
 vastav main atal shuruyaat se hi udaaravaadi the
 Soon after becoming MP for the first time, in 1957, Atal had heard Prime Minister Nehru in the Lok Sabha saying that the government would build a hotel
 atal hairaan rah gaye
 He stood up to say that the government should build hospitals, not hotels
 nehru ne ghumkar dekha ki yah gustaakh saansad koun he or palatakar kaha, "ham hotalon se munafa kamaayenge, jiskaa istemaal aspataalon ko banane main kiya jayega
 However, Atal did not agree with this dilution of the policies of the Soviet Union
 1999 ke baad, jab atal sarkaar teesri baar satta main ai, tab se lekar sitambar 2002 tak pradhanmantri kii ichha ke anusaar hi udaarikaran teji se chalata rahaa
 In the Budget of February 1999, Atal's Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha expressed his intention to not only disinvestment of shares, but also to privatize public sector undertakings
 aisa laga ki varsh 2002 ke baad atal kaa prabhaav samaapt ho gaya tha or ve udaarikaran kii raah par or aage jane main asamarth the
 The matter got worse when the proposal for privatization of two public sector oil companies, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum, came up
 donon hi companiyaan pehle bahurashtriya (eso or kaaltex) thim, lekin 1970 ke dashak ke madhya tak main unka rashtriyaykaran kar diya gaya
 She was in the strategic arena and Atal's overzealous Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie wanted to sell both companies
 farvari 2002 main hui cabinet kii ek baithak main atal ne donon companiyon ke nijeekaran par saidhantik sahmati de di
 However, as was his style, he left Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie, Petroleum Minister Ram Naik and Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha to decide on the rest
 is vishay par jabardast saarvajanik charchaa hui, or ise darshaate hue hi india today ne "darty war'' sheershak se ek lekh prakashit kiya
 It spoke of a range of differences within the government and speculated that a corporate war had erupted
 khabar ne sawaal uthaaya ki yadi reliance, jo ek daavedaar hone ja rahaa tha, ek bhi tel company ko kharid letaa he, to uski rifining kii kshamta sarkaar ke swaamitv vaale indian oil corporation (ai

 yadi reliance kii kshamta ai
 O
 si
 Becomes equal to, then the Government of India's control over the strategic sector will be challenged
 darasal dar isi baat kaa tha, vishesh rup se is kaaran, kyonki reliance siyaasi galiyaaron kaa ek khilaadi mana jaataa tha
 At the cabinet meeting held on September 7, 2002, when the topic of the two oil companies were sold, Atal said that they wanted to move forward and hoped no one would object to it, but the ministers expressed their concern And Ram Naik was not ready at all
 tel companiyon kaa nijeekaran bhale hi roak diya gaya, lekin atal hameshaa chaahate the ki ve ho jaae
 Actually, he appointed Arun Shourie for this reason, because he will not bow down to political pressure, whereas any leader is forced to bow to the pressure of the people
 yahi nahin, shouri ke andar sakchati thi or apana kaam bina bhay yaa pakshpaat ke karte the
 It was also true that he had written books presenting Hindu ideology, due to which Nagpur could not easily take him on his target
 atal bhale hi sudhaarak the, par ve sarvasammati par chalanevaale vyakti bhi the
 This was seen not only in the privatization of oil companies, when the decision was opposed, but also in other cases

 sinha or unki vitt mantralay kii team keemten badhaane par adi hui thi, lekin atal ne vitt mantri ko badhotaree ko waapas lene kaa aadesh diya
 People close to say that Atal had realized that the anti-middle-class budget would damage the government's image and the party, so it would not be right to do so
 us varsh aage chalakar, yashavanth sinha ke badale jaswant singh ko vitt mantri banaaya gaya
 Jaswant was Atal's favorite person from the beginning for that post

 He said that as part of this strategy, the grand alliance will organize a program to celebrate the death anniversary of Ram Manohar Lohia at Bapu Auditorium in Patna on October 12 in which all the prominent leaders of the constituent parties of this alliance will be present and demonstrate solidarity
 samvaadadaata sammelan main upasthit na to kushvaha or na hi rajd vidhayak kumaar sarvajit ne spasht kiya ki rajd netaa tejasvi prasad yadav is kaarykram main shaamil honge yaa nahin
 Kushwaha said that he has also invited the leaders of the Left parties to participate in the ceremony
 lohia ke congress ke khilaaf mukhar rahane ke bare main puche jane par kushvaha ne kaha ki yah puri tarah se sahi nahin he kyonki unhone apni raajnneeti kii shuruyaat isi dal se kii thi par baad main apane raste alag kar liye the
 Asked if JDU will be invited to join the grand alliance, Kushwaha said that this is your (media's) subject

 As the day comes to know from the morning, so does the film Jab Harry Met Sejal's first glimpse
 aisa lagata he ki shahrukh khan ko cast karne ke chakkar main kahani main jabaran bhavukta laane kii koshish kii gai he
 Anushka Sharma also seems uncomfortable on screen
 jahaan tak jab harry met sejal ke nirdeshak imtiyaaj ali kii baat he to ve saal-dar-saal ek jaisi filmein de rahe hai
 Their complex romance sometimes brings tears to their eyes but does not tie up with them
 lihaaja jab harry met sejal bor karne lagati he
 The story is similar to the one we know when Harry Met Sejal is predictable like other Bollywood films
 film main tour guide harry europe main chhutityaan manaane aae ek bhartiya samooh ke saath najar aata he
 He takes pictures of this group and hopes to have some unique experiences by living among them, which he has missed in his life
 ye kami kya he? imtiyaaj ali iskaa jawaab dete hai
 They say that we are fast asleep in our seat! Harry and Sejal meet when Sejal loses his engagement ring
 sejal kaa puraa parivaar india waapas laut jaataa he, lekin sejal kahati he ki vah india tabhi waapas aegi, jab vah apni sagaai kii anguthi dhund legi
 In this way the journey of a 'lost tour guide' and a 'needy Gujarati girl of guidance' begins
 shahrukh ne pehle bhi bhagaai dusron kii dulhaniyaalekin isi ke saath jab harry met sejal dekhne gaye darshakon kii musiibat bhi shuru ho jaati he
 Shahrukh did not do anything in this film that he had not done before
 yahaan tak ki vah kai filmon main dusron kii dulhaniya pehle bhi bhaga chuke hai
 If you take Dilwale Dulhania, you will remember! As far as the character of Anushka in Harry Met Sejal is concerned, he did not do anything other than his Gujarati accent
 imtiyaaj ne jarur thodaa bahut nayaa kiya he
 His film appears to be Karan Johar's 2000s film, which has thousands of songs, romantic dialogues and extremely boring characters as well
 yah jarur he ki jitne samay ye film screen par rahati he, aap budapest, praha, berlin, lisbon, vienna aadi shahar dekh sakate hai
 There is nothing in this film that you should watch the film carefully
 kahaan jayega ab shahrukh khan kaa kariyaryah sahi he ki shahrukh ke pichley 25 saal ke kaam ko pasand kiya gaya he, lekin yah bhi sahi he ki ve is film se darshakon ke saamne badi uljhan paidaa karne vaale hai
 Even though in the film you can see the secret of Rahul or Dil Wale Dulhania Le as Shah Rukh, but Sejal Simran is not there at all
 anoushka sharma kaajol nahin lagatee
 Anushka's Gujarati accent for 150 minutes gives no pleasant feeling
 film main itane gane hai ki ek had ke baad aap unhen ginana hi chhod denge
 Even if Harry Met Sejal was not made, there was not going to be any difference in Bollywood
 is film se shahrukh, anoushka or imtiyaaj teenon kii filmography main ek kharaab film jud gai he
 Even though Shah Rukh had to sing his film - Saatra Ke Saathon Mein Saatra Ke Saath
 
 
 sukun de, lekin baaki sabake liye harry or sejal kaa milanaa acha anubhav nahin rah saktaa he

 piem modi ne baatcheet kii shuruuaat karte hue kaha ki swili bhashaa main baraak kaa matlab he, jise aashirwad praapt he

 lekin agar ham sirf sapane dekhte hai or kuch karte nahin hai to niraashaa hoti he
 i have never had a dream, just a passion to do something
 obama ne kaha ki bharat main hue swaagat se khush hum
 India and America are both great democracies
 america main log bharat main modi ke garibi hataane ke kaarykram se prabhavit hai
 India's work on issues like women empowerment, education, health, employment is commendable

 aaj ke yuvakon kii ungaliyon par vastut: puri duniya or uski jaankaree he
 They know what to do for society and country
 main samajhataa hum ki sarkaron or netaaon ko keval upar se shashan nahin karnaa chahie, balki samaveshi or paardarshee rup se janata tak pahunchnaa chahie
 They should talk about the direction of their country
 unhone kaha ki bharat or america ke liye badi baat yah he ki donon khule samaaj hai

 jisamen maine choti-choti baton se jivan ko behatar tareeke se sochna siikhaa

 Saving daughter, teaching daughter is our social and cultural duty and human responsibility
 obama jis prakaar se apni donon betiyon kaa laalan-paalan karte he vah apane aap main ek prerana he
 Sex ratio is a concern in India and the root cause of this is our faulty attitude towards boys and girls
 is pad par pahunchane ke bare main kabhi sochaa tha?desh ke piem banane ke bare main modi ne kaha ki ji nahin, maine kabhi kalpana nahin kii thi ki main piem banuun
 i have been telling everyone for a long time that never dream of becoming anything
 agar sapane dekhne hai to kuch karne ke dekho
 Even today dreams of becoming something are not in my mind, but there are definitely things to be done
 isi sawaal par obama ne kaha ki unhone white house tak pahunchane kii kalpana kabhi nahin kii thi

 'youths make the world one,' Prime Minister Modi said, "in a time, people inspired by the communist ideology used to invoke the world and said that the workers of the world should be one"
 yah naaraa kai dashakon tak chalata rahaa, lekin main samajhataa hum aaj ke yuva kii jo shakti he or jo uski pahunch he, use dekhte hue main yahi kahuunga, ‘yuvakon duniya ko ek karo’
 i think he has this power and he can do it
 nai peedi ke yuva ke bare main obama ne kaha ki nai peedi kaa yuva ek vaishvik naagarik he or vah samay or simaaon se bandhaa nahin he
 In such a situation, our leadership, government and society should have a better attitude towards them
