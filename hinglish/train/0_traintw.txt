 There are two major reasons behind this
 ek to 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sabhi saat siton par party ne clin sweep kiya, duusari baat modi sarkaar kii ore se dedh hajaar se adhik avaidh coloniyon kaa niyamitikaran kar kareeb 40 lakh logon ko phayda pahunchane kaa faisla
 This makes the leaders feel that this time the party can perform better
 dilli main pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari, sanghathan mantri siddharthan or mahaamantriyon ke karyaalayon main aise ummidavaaron kaa biodata pahunch rahaa he
 The election schedule has not been announced yet, in which case this figure may increase further
 bhaajapa sutron ne bataaya ki chunaav ladane ke liye machi hode kaa alam yah he ki har seat par ausatan 40-40 netaaon ke biodata jamaa ho chuke hai
 BJP will use survey agencies to find qualified and serious candidates from these
 ye agenciyaan kendriya karyaalay ne pehle se hair kar rakhi hai
 Based on the survey report of the agencies, a list of at least three leaders will be prepared after scrutinizing the contenders for each seat
 yahi list pradesh chunaav samiti kii baithak main bheji jaaegi
 In every assembly constituency, survey agencies will assess the winning potential of ticket claimants
 agenciyaan apane sample survey main shaamil logon ke saamne daavedaaron ke naam rakhkar pasandida pratyaashee chunane ko kahengi
 According to the choice of the public, the survey agencies will submit the report to the party, deciding the order of preference of the claimants
 yah survey report daavedaaron kii chhavi, unka vyavhaar, kshetra main sakriyata, saamaajik sanghathanon se judaav, phens folowing aadi par aadhaarit hoga
 The special thing is that there is no shortage of contenders for BJP tickets even in Muslim majority seats
 silampur, okhla, ballimaran, chandani chowk, babarpur va simapuri jaise vidhansabha kshetron main bhi bhaajapa se ladane ke liye kaaphi netaaon kii argiyaan aa rahi hai
 a senior leader of the Delhi BJP unit said on Friday, "on an average there are 40 people in each seat
 khaas baat he ki usamen bhi kareeb 10-10 log majboot daavedaar hai, jo party ke vibhinn prakoshthon se jude hai yaa phir anya tarah ke daayitv main hai
 In such a situation, it is a challenge for the organization to find 'worthy among the worthy'
 sarvamaanya chehron ko variyata milegi, jisase kisi ko tikat milane par naaraazgi na ho
 The report of survey agencies will be important in the selection of candidates
 " bataa den ki 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main aam aadmi party ne 70 main se 67 siten hasil kin thim, jabaki bhaajapa ko sirf teen siten milin thim

 Sofia posted a video on her Instagram account with her fiancé, detailing the incident with her in Mecca
 apane saath hui ghatana ke alaava bhi sophia ne apane duusare post main anya mahilaon ke saath aisi ghatnaayen hone kii baat kahi he
 He has said that there is no separate line for women here and such incidents happen to them
 sophia in dinon apane mangetar ke saath makka gai hui hai
 In a very large caption of his video, he has written the story of the entire incident with him
 unhone likhaa, 'islam auraton kii izzat karnaa sikhaata he
 No man should touch a non-woman other than his wife
 yahi kaaran he ki mujhe islam pasand he lekin yah niyam makka main lagu nahin hote
 When men go there, they forget this rule

 When i was one meter away from the sacred stone, i was pushed, which could not even breathe
 main bahut dar gai
 When i looked back, my hijab got stuck in my throat
 logon ke dhakke se meraa dam ghutane laga or maine chillaanaa shuru kar diya
 ' Islam respects women
 a man must not touch a woman that is not his wife, or be violent to her
 That is why i love islam
 These rules however do not apply in Mecca
 Men forget the rules when they go there
 Today on my 2nd umra as i attempted again to touch the black stone, i was being pushed by men
 One man was pushing his genitals into me from behind
 
 the women's queue is non existent because men have used their physical strength to push women out of the way
 As i was about a metre from the black stone, i was pushed so hard against my ribs i could not breath
 i was scared, so i decided to turn back, as i did, men kept pushing, and my hijab came off and got caught between the pushing men, i was being dragged back by it and was started to be strangled by it
 i screamed
 Suddenly a few good men saw what was happening and came to my rescue
 i am so shaken up and sad that at the house of God; men do not care about the words in the Quran
 Allah is in me and she says to me that if a man thinks he will go to Jannat by touching the black stone yet disregards the respect Islam has for women, then your hajj or umrah is useless
 In the house of Allah women are being disrespected
 Allah is the greatest she is the most high 
 
 
 i am so sad this happens in her house in Makkah
 The man who lifts a women to the stone and does not touch it himself will surely see Jannat
 i appeal to the King to set up 1 day for only women so that they may with deepest respect, be able to touch the Kabba, without this non islamic behavior from men
 i know women desire as much as men to touch the kabba and stone
 
 
 so why should they have to suffer? a woman cannot match a mans physical strength
 Even in the Cave where the prophet pbuh received the Quran, people are throwing rubbish and even urinating around it as their are no toilets
 Again
 
 do you think by touching the walls of the cave your prayers will be answered if you do not look after her home? i was there 2 days and will try again
 
 i saw women trampled on and squashed by men
 
 the basic foundations of Islam
 
 peace love and respect for each other
 
 have been forgotten in the very place they should be remembered
 Namaste

 it will go white when there is love there and support and unity, when women are revered and men step back to allow the sacred feminine to step forward and worship
 Women gave birth to men and yet here they have no respect for that or the respect that Islam teaches about women
 i was told women need a mehrem because things have happened in the past like they have to me
 What is the mehrem supposed to do in this situation? i ask the king to allow women half day there and men half day
 i am ashamed that this is happening in the house of Allah
 Lets bring pure love and peace to the black stone
 Mecca is indeed a place of intense sacred energy, and many pilgrims are full of love
 
 i know the day will come when the aggression and pushing stops at the black stone
 
 and women can walk up with reverence and dignity

" agar niyamit aamadani kam he, to ise badhaane ke liye ekamusth rakam se ek hisse kaa istemaal tatkaal anyuity vikalp kharidne ke liye kar sakate hai
 Considering the way life expectancy is increasing, increasing the annuity plan would be a better option as it takes care of inflation

 vahiin clive loyad ne australia ko behtareen team bataaya jabaki unki najar main imran khan behtareen khilaadi the kyonki wo team main jaan foonkane kaa madda rakhte the
 Lloyd also believed that Allen, Steve and Ponting managed their team well, which led to them winning the World Cup three times
 kapil dev ne bhi mana ki westeindies ek behtareen team thi
 When Alan Border, Steve Waugh, Ricky Ponting were asked the mantra of their success, they said that we used to try to play every match better than the previous match
 har khilaadi ne apni parformens ko behatar banane ke liye mehnat kii jisaki vajah se team majboot hui
 Who is the 2015 World Cup contender: When asked about these seven players, who will be the next world champion, everyone had different views on this question
 clive loyad kaa maananaa tha ki aise to kai timen hai jo behatar pradarshan kar sakati hai lekin australia or bharat is baar champion kii res main shaamil hai
 At the same time, Alan Border and Steve Waugh considered Australia and South Africa as strong contenders
 arjuna rantunga kaa maananaa tha ki bharat is vakt kharaab pradarshan se jujh rahaa he isliye is world cap main australia or srilanka kaa chance he

 MNS President Raj Thackeray has once again targeted the BJP
 raaj thakare ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis par bhi jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 He said that if the train is to be run only for Gujaratis and to create prosperity routes to separate Vidarbha, then it is absolutely not acceptable
 raaj ne kaha ki bullate train sirf guzarat ke liye or ek lakh karod kaa karj saare desh vaasi bharen, yah kahaan kii insaafi he
 Therefore, MNS is opposing this bullet train
 raaj ne gujarat chunaav par kaha ki teen saal pehle bijepi ne vikaas kaa blue print pesh kiya tha, lekin ab blue film dikhaakar chunaav jeetna chaahati he
 Raj Thackerayhi did not stop while addressing a public meeting held in Thane
 unhone yoga diwas or svachh bharat abhiyaan kii bhi khilli udayi or kaha ki aaj dash bhar main balaatkaar, lut, fareb or jati-dharm ke naam par kya khaaya ja rahaa he
 Earlier Mulla and Maulvi used to take fatwas, but now Jain seekers and Jain sages are taking out
 aise in sabhi buraaiyon ko dur karne or aparaadhon ko lagaam lagane ke bajaay pradhanmantri narendra modi yoga kar iske tips baantate rahe hai
 Today, if the body is floating on the water in the Ganges river of Varanasi, Narendra Modi's constituency, will India be clean
 raaj ne kaha kipradhanmantri modiaj bhi gujarat ke pradhanmantri kii tarah pesh aa rahe he
 If he loves his state, then Raj Thackeray also loves Maharashtra and its identity
 teen saal main vikaas nahin kar pai bijepiraj thakare ne bhaajapa par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki varsh 2014 ke chunaav ke dauraan bhaajapa ne vikaas kaa blue print pesh kiya tha, lekin pichley teen varshon main vikaas to nahin kar pai
 In such a situation, now Gujarat wants to win the election by showing blue film to the voters
 raaj ne kaha ki bhaajapa ne ab logon ke nijee jivan main taank-jhaank karnaa shuru kar diya he, jo ki vyakti aazaadee par prahaar he
 Rahul also attacked the BJP leaders who objected to the propaganda started on BJP and social media
 unhone kaha ki pehle jahaan bhaajapa or uske netaa congress netaa rahul gandhi kaa soshal media par majaak udaate the, aaj pradhanmantri narendra modi sahit sabhi bhaajapa netaaon kii naak main unhone dam kar rakhaa he
 In such a situation, the BJP is not able to know what to do
 sarkaar pheriwalo ke samarthan main ja sakati he supreme courtraj thakare ne kaha ki jis kaam ko sarkaar or prashasan ko karnaa chahie tha, vah manase ne kar dikhaaya
 In such a situation, the MNS will now keep an eye on these hawkers and the city especially the station premises will be hawker free
 unhone sarkaar or anya partiyon dwaara pheriwaalon ke samarthan par sawaal khadaa karte hue kaha ki sirf aarthik laabh ke chalate 70 lakh janata kaa samarthan karne ke bajaay yah partiyaan 70 hajaar logon kaa samarthan karti najar aa rahi he
 Not only this, the government is also going to wager a stay by going to the Supreme Court in protest against the decision of the High Court

 He also attacked Thane Police Commissioner Paramvir Singh and questioned the bond of one crore
 bhaajapa par pichhadon ko saadhane kii betaabi shaayad kuch zyada hi he
 As the veela of elections is getting closer, it seems to be growing impatient
 tabhi to pehle centre sarkaar pichhadon ke aarakshan main ati pichhadon ko zyada hissedari dilaane ke pratyaksh makasad se rashtriya pichhadaa varg ayog ko sanvaidhanik darja dene ke liye samvidhan sanshodhan le ai
 But on the last day of the monsoon session of Parliament, he got stuck in the Rajya Sabha on 1 August, then on 23 August, the Union Cabinet made two such decisions, which made the backward leaders of the BJP waver
 udhar, virodhiyon ko bhi aalochana ke liye ''rajnatik makasad saadhane" ke alaava koi sutara nahin mila
 The NDA cabinet led by Narendra Modi has given an income limit of Rs 6 lakh for the creamy layer in the OBC reservation
 se badhaakar 8 lakh ru
 Annually taxed
 duusare, kendriya suchi main pichde samudaayon kii up-shreniyan nirdhaarit karne kii sambhaavna kii padtaal ke liye ek ayog ke gathan kii manjuuri di
 Its direct purpose is to provide the benefit of reservation even to the most backward castes, who are deprived of this benefit
 bhaajapa saansad hukumdev narayan yadav ne kaha, ''iskaa desh bhar ke obisi swaagat karenge
 "union Minister Santosh Gangwar said," This is a historic decision
 " lekin rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ne ise sirf or sirf rajnatik hatkandaa or obisi samaaj ko baantne kii sajashi bataaya he
 RJD spokesman Manoj Jha says, "this is nothing more than a politics by the central government
" "darasal, rajnatik jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki isi saal uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaavon main ati pichhadon ko jodgaye main baari kamyaabi se utsahit bhaajapa is varg ko apana pukhta vot bank bananaa chaahati he
 The party hopes that it can get it in the upcoming assembly elections and the next Lok Sabha elections
 uttar pradesh main gaiyr-yadav voton kaa ek bada hissaa bhaajapa ko mila tha
 BJP sources point to its three benefits: the arithmetic of winning elections, the avoidance of the rss's uncomfortable comments about reservation, and the opposition parties to stop speaking
 obisi aarakshan ke bheetar aarakshan kii sambhaavna tay karne ke liye ayog (abhi gathit hona he) apane gathan ke 12 saptaah ke andar report degaa
 "the commission will be formed soon," says Ganesh Singh, BJP MP and chairman of the OBC Welfare Parliamentary Committee
 abhi tak centre sarkaar kii naukariyon or shikshan sansthaanon main obisi aarakshan kaa laabh is varg ke apekshaakrit sampann log hi uthaa rahe hai jabaki ek bada tabaka laabh se vanchit he
 The commission will identify such castes and include them in the sub-quota
 "mana ja rahaa he ki ayog teen yaa chaar sadasyeey hoga
 The National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) in 2011 and a parliamentary committee in 2015 have recommended to create sub-categories in OBC reservation
 vajah yah ki aarakshan kaa laabh is varg ke vanchit tabake tak kii koi vyavastha kii ja sake
 When such a recommendation was made by NCBC, the UPA government was at the center
 lekin pichhadi jatiyon ke samarthan vaali sapa, rajd jaisi kai partiyaan iskaa virodh karti rahi hai
 They probably fear that this will divide the backward class and cause them political damage
 faisle kii timming bhi mahatvapurn he
 The assembly elections in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh are scheduled around the same time when the committee formed to decide the sub quota will submit the report
 phir agle varsh madhya pradesh, rajasthan, karnataka or chhattisgarh main chunaav hone hai or uske fouran baad loksabhaa chunaav kii vela aa jaaegi
 The committee's report could form the basis of electoral gains for the BJP
 obisi ayog ke mutabik, desh main pichhadi jatiyon kii sankchaya 39 karod se zyada he
 The Social, Economic, Caste Census (SECC) has also shown that the benefit of reservation is not reaching the weaker castes and sections
 siyaasi sutron ke mutabik, samaaj ke is bade tabake tak pahunchane ke liye bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah modi sarkaar ke faisle ko party ke liye lonchig pad kii tarah istemaal karne kii yojana bana rahe hai
 However, according to BJP General Secretary Bhupendra Yadav, this decision has nothing to do with electoral politics
 ve kehete hai, ''obisi jatiyon kaa vargeekaran pehle se 11 rajyon main he
 11 states including Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala already have such quotas
 yah ayog usamen koi pherbadal nahin kar saktaa
 The central government itself has a list of about 5,000 OBC castes
 inhen centre kii naukariyon or shikshan sansthaanon main laabh kaise mili, vanchit jatiyon kaa samaayojan kaise kiya jaae, ayog yah tay karegaa
 The intention of classification is to benefit those castes who have not been able to take advantage of reservation instead of entitlement, rather than adding new castes
 unhen laabh kaa bhagidaar bananaa yahi uddeshy he
 "perhaps to avoid the charge of practicing politics, the BJP is not directly describing it as its formula
 party ise karpuri formula kah rahi he
 Says Ganesh Singh, "in 1972, the former Bihar Chief Minister Karpoori Thakur had also sought the same so that the benefits given should be distributed among the OBC castes in such a way that class discrimination does not stand within the OBC castes
 "beshak, sarkaar kaa yah faisla anayas nahin he
 Modi government has completed three years
 use mishan 2019 ke liye us (obisi) vot bank ko na sirf jode rakhana he, jinhone 2014 main modi ko vot diya tha, balki nae votaron ko bhi jodpha he
 When the BJP got 34 per cent of the OBC vote in the last Lok Sabha election, then why the effort to add new voters with such vigor? Says a senior BJP leader, "it is not easy for the party to retain 26 seats in Gujarat, 25 out of 25 in Rajasthan, 26 out of 29 in Madhya Pradesh, 71 out of 80 seats in UP
 "aise main chunavi ganit ke lihaaj se aarakshan ke bheetar aarakshan jarurat bhi he or maang bhi
 Then it can also become a shield against the uncomfortable comments of the RSS on the reservation
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav se ke dauraan aarakshan kii samiksha kii aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat kii tippanee kaa khamiyaja bhaajapa bhugat chuki he
 Then the Sangh chief had said, "we say make a committee
 unako tay karne do ki kitne logon ko kitne dinon ke liye aarakshan jaruri he
 "another benefit of this can also be in the form of silencing the opposition, which has often accused the BJP of being anti-reservation
 haalanki manoj jha kehete hai, ''jatigat janaganana ke aankade saarvajanik kiye bina is tarah ke vargeekaran kaa koi matlab nahin he
 "of course, the stakes are strong but the BJP does not want to leave anything else in preparation for the Mission 2019

 bhartiya rigerv bank ne is saal desh main jaali noton kii badhati sankhya tathaa unki pahchaan main aane vaali dikkaton par lagaam lagane ke liye kai faisle liye hai

 The numbers in both the number panels of the banknotes will be in increasing size from left to right
 isamen shuru ke teen akshar or ank alphanumeric aakaar main ek samaan honge
 In this new note, every number in the series will be in different sizes, if put it clearly, now all the numbers printed in the note will be in increasing order
 rigerv bank ke anusaar sankhya ko badhate hue kram mendene se aam log asli or nakli note main aasaani se fark kar sakegein
 Let us tell you that earlier the series numbers were the same
 2) ubhari blide line shurune noton main ubhari blide line shuru kii gai he jo note ke aage ke bhaag par daaen or baayen ore hogi
 In such a case, four lines are given in two blocks in a 100 rupee note
 500 rupee ke note main teen block (2-1-2) main paanch line di gai hai or vahiin 1,000 rupee ke note main chaar blokon (1-2-2-1) main chah line hongi
 By which the blind people will easily find out the note of how much it is by touching the bulge of these lines
 vahiin bank adhikariyon kii maane to noton ke dizin main anya sabhi chijen 2005 ke anya noton ke samaan hi hongi
 3) Identification mark will be larger The size of the existing identification mark near the left end of the banknote has been increased

 The design of these notes, now issued, will be similar to the 100, 500 and 1000 rupee notes issued earlier in the Mahatma Gandhi series which include additional features such as numbers in increasing sizes in number panels, bleed lines, and larger identification marks
 
 ye note dikhne main aise honge
 Apart from this, the RBI has also warned in its guidelines that people who write the number, message or name in the place of the note's watermark should not do so
 kyonkiis water mark vaali jagah par hi gandhi jeeki photo dikhti he or nakli note pahachaachane kaa ye ek jaruri feechar he
 If people will avoid doing this then the general public will not have to face trouble in recognizing notes

 ) 2019 main shivasena pradhanmantri modi ke netritv main chunaav nahin ladegi
 Uddhav Thackeray's announcement did not get a reply from BJP, but the ally party LGP stood up
 ramvilas paswan kaa kahana he, uddhav raajnneeti na karen, 2024 tak koi vaikency nahin he, modi hi pradhanmantri bane rahenge
 Earlier in Mumbai, Uddhav Thackeray surprised everyone by making this statement on Wednesday when he said, 'ram Vilas Paswan forcibly wrote that he will fight under Modi's leadership in 2019
 itani jaldbaaji kyon? aaj jo mila he wo desh ke kaam main aana chahie
 Still 2 years left
 apane netritv ko thopane kii itani jaldbaazi kyon? shivasena ko yah kadaapi manjuur nahin
 ' uddhav ke is bayaan se hairaan ramvilas paswan ne guuruuvaar ko aarope lagaaya ki uddhav galatabayani kar rahe hai
 On Thursday, Paswan clarified that Thackeray is doing politics
 darasal maamla beete maheene hue endie kii baithak kaa he
 In this, the leaders of 33 parties jointly passed this proposal
 paswan ne kaha ki baithak main ye prastaav paarit hua tha ki 2019 ke aam chunaav narendra modi ke netritv main ladaa jayega
 Uddhav Thackeray himself was also present in this meeting and was the third speaker in the meeting
 paswan kaa aarope he ki uddhav baithak ke andar kuch kehete rahe, baahar kuch or kah rahe hai
 The comments jaahir he, ye takaraar abhi or badhegi
 In the case which was between BJP and Shiv Sena, LJP has also come up
 uddhav thakare or ramvilas paswan ke bich ye takaraar aise vakt par shuru hui he jab aagaamee raashtrapati chunaavon se pehle vipakshi dal ek saajha ummidavaar khadaa karne kii jaddojahad main jute hai
 In such a situation, this dispute between the Shiv Sena President and the President of the Lok Janshakti Party can increase difficulties among the NDA strategists
 yahaan ye sawaal bhi uth rahaa he ki kya shivasena in chunaavon se pehle apane aapako endie se alag karne kii koshish kar rahe hai? is sandarbh main ye bhi mahatvapurn he ki pichley raashtrapati chunaavon main bhi shiv sena ne endie kaa saath nahin diya tha
 Surprised by this statement of Uddhav, Ram Vilas Paswan on Thursday alleged that Uddhav is misrepresenting
 paswan ne guuruuvaar ko safai dete hue kaha ki thakare raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 Actually the matter is about the NDA meeting held last month
 isamen 33 dalon ke netaaon ne milakar ye prastaav paas kiya
 Paswan said that the resolution was passed in the meeting that the 2019 general elections will be fought under the leadership of Narendra Modi
 is baithak main khud uddhav thakare bhi maujuud the or baithak main tisare vaktaa the
 Paswan alleges that Uddhav kept saying something inside the meeting, saying something else outside
 tippaniyan Obviously, this dispute will only increase further
 jo maamla bijepi or shivasena ke bich kaa tha, usamen algepi bhi aa gai he
 The altercation between Uddhav Thackeray and Ram Vilas Paswan has started at a time when the opposition parties are struggling to field a common candidate ahead of the upcoming presidential elections
 aise main shivasena adhyaksh or lok janashakti party ke adhyaksh ke bich ye takaraar endie ke ranneetikaron ke bich mushkilen badha sakati he
 The question is also being raised here whether the Shiv Sena is trying to separate itself from the NDA before these elections
 It is also important in this context that even in the last presidential elections, Shiv Sena did not support the NDA
 paswan ne kaha ki baithak main ye prastaav paarit hua tha ki 2019 ke aam chunaav narendra modi ke netritv main ladaa jayega

 With this it will be clear that Manoj Tiwari will become the state president for the second time or the BJP will bet on some other face
 dilli main sanghathan kaa chunaav 11 sitambar se shuru hone ja rahaa he
 Elections will be held from booth presidents to divisional, district and state executive
 11 sitambar se 15 disambar tak rajya main chunaav kii prakriya khatm ho jaaegi
 All eyes are on Manoj Tiwari whether he will be able to save the chair or not
 kyon bane rah sakate hai adhyakshauttar-purvi dilli se saansad manoj tiwari ko november 2016 main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne dilli kii kaman saunpi thi
 Prior to Tiwari, Satish Upadhyay was the state president of the BJP
 manoj tiwari ko pradesh sanghathan kii kaman dene ke peeche party kaa makasad rahaa ki vah uttar-pradesh or bihar ke matadaataaon ko apane 'purvaanchaliya chehre' ke jariye bijepi ke kareeb laane main safal honge
 Tiwari was also largely successful in this
 manoj tiwari ke adhyaksh banane ke baad hue 2017 ke nagar nigam or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne shandaar pradarshan kiya
 These things go in favor of Manoj Tiwari
 chunki bijepi ke samvidhan main purv main hue sanshodhan ke chalate adhyaksh pad par koi vyakti teen-teen saal ke do kaarykaal tak rah saktaa he
 In such a situation, the constitution of the party will not be obstructed in the way of Tiwari
 agar chunaavon main party kaa pradarshan paimaana bana to manoj tiwari dobaaraa bijepi adhyaksh ban sakate hai
 Why can Tiwari be removed? Manoj Tiwari, who is considered an outsider to Delhi, was also made president by BJP President Amit Shah for the purpose that he will be able to remove the factionalism among the local leaders and bring them on one platform
 magar manoj tiwari gutbandi ko dur nahin kar paae
 On the contrary, the local leaders who were considered to be the antagonists of each other to establish the supremacy of the organization in Delhi, united themselves on the issue of external versus local and opened a front against Tiwari
 bijepi main lambey samay tak sanghathan kii raajnneeti se jude rahe netaa isliye manoj tiwari ke khilaaf hai ki unhen sanghathan kaa anubhav nahin he
 Nevertheless, he was made the state president
 manoj tiwari pehle samaajawaadee party main the
 Yogi was defeated in Gorakhpur by contesting the Lok Sabha election in 2009 against Adityanath
 baad main vah bijepi main aae
 In 2014, he became the first MP from the north-east Delhi seat on a BJP ticket and then two years later, the party suddenly made him the state president in the national capital
 sangh prishthibhumi ke netaa manoj tiwari kii is tarakkee se kuch asantusht bhi dikhe
 In 2017, the fight between BJP leader Vijay Goel and Manoj Tiwari came to the surface
 jab emsidi chunaav main jite parshadon ke sammaan ke liye vijay goyal ne 16 may 2017 ko sammaan samaaroh yojit kiya tha
 If @ bjp4delhiwants to win, need to have new president

 Later, the organization minister Siddharthan had to interfere as the tension escalated

 ganga dashahra ke avasar par jaanate hai ki aakhir maa ganga kaa avataran kaise hua or kyon sadiyon se log inaki puja archana karte aa rahe hai
 In ancient times, there was a king whose name was Sagar
 sagar ek pratapi or shaktishaalee raja the
 The horse Ashwamedha of King Sagar was captured by Indra, the king of the gods and tied the horse to the ashram of Kapil Muni
 udhar ashwamedh ghode kii talash main raja sagar ke 60 hajaar putr nikal pade
 When he saw the horse tied in the monk's ashram, he attacked the ashram itself
 isi samay tap main leen kapil muni kii ankhen khul gayi wo krodhit ho uthe
 The flame arose in the eyes of the sage and shattered 60 thousand sons of Sagar in a moment
 raja sagar ke ek or putr anshuman ko jab is baat kaa pataa chalaa to unhone kapil muni se apane bhaaiyon kii aatma ke uddhaar kii prarthana kii
 Then Kapil Muni told them that if the holy Ganges water is sprinkled on the consumed real sons then they can get liberation
 anshuman ne bahut koshish kii lekin wo apane bhaaiyon ko kapil muni ke coup se mukt nahin kara sake
 Later his grandson King Bhagiratha undertook penance for the peace of his ancestor's soul
 purvajon kaa uddhaar karne ke liye bhageerath ne kathor tapasya kii or aakhirkaar ganga ko dharti par aane kii unki prarthana ko sweekaar karnaa padaa
 Now the question was how did Ganga come to Earth? The current of the Ganges was so fast that their coming straight to the earth meant destruction
 tab bhagirath ne ek baar phir tapasya kar bhagwaan shiv se madad kii guhaar lagaai
 Bhole Shankar told Ganga to go to earth through his jatas and then 60,000 sons of King Sagar were saved and they got salvation
 maa ganga ke avataran kii kahanebhagirath aage aage ja rahe the or ganga unke peeche chal rahi thim raja bhageerath patit paavani ko gangotri se lekar gangasagar tak gaye
 Here he begged Kapil Muni to free him from his curse
 ganga kii amritdhara bhageerath kii kathor tapasya kaa fal thi
 Maharishi Kapil was pleased to see Mokshadayini Maa Gaga on earth
 unhone sagar putron ko apane shraap se mukt kar diya
 The mythological significance of Ganga - It is believed that Ganga lived at the feet of Shri Vishnu - By the penance of Bhagiratha, Shiva held her in his jatas - then Shiva ji divided his jatas into seven streams - these streams are - Nalini, Hridini, Pavani, Sita, Chakshu, Indus and Bhagirathi - Bhagirathi is the Ganges and is considered as Mokshadayini in Hinduism - Ganga is also called the sister of Mother Parvati - She is the half-century of Shiva
 It is also believed that - and still lives in Shiva's jaat, the glory of Ganga Dussehra - the festival of Ganga Dussehra is celebrated on Jyeshtha Shukla Dashami Tithi - It is believed that on this day, the descent of Ganga took place on earth - this day Ganga bath, use of Ganges water, - pujan main jo bhi saamagree prayog karen unki sankhya 10 honi chahie- vishesh rup se 10 deepak kaa prayog karen, daan bhi das brahmanon ko karen- parantu brahmanon ko die jane vaale anaaj solah mutthi hone chahie Today is Mauni Amavasya and today is the solar eclipse

 On the occasion of solar eclipse, there is a fair of devotees and pandits at the Ganges Ghat in the city of Kashi, Shiva

 Cricketer Raine Harris, who retired just before the Ashes series, says her first reaction was anger when she heard the news
 unka kahana he ki sab isaki vajah jaananaa chaahate hai ki australian team ne aishez kyon nahin jiti
 According to him, the team did not do well because, they were not good that day
 wo kehete hai ki wo is baat se hairaan hai ki saal 2015 main ladakon ke pradarshan nahin kar paane kii vajah ladakiyon ko mana ja rahaa he
 Harris also argues that when the Wags traveled with the team throughout the World Cup with this team and the Australian team became the World Champion, where were these critics? They also say that many players of the team are out of home for about 250 days
 aise main vaigs ko dauron par jane se rokna kya zyaadati nahin he?tippaniyan Till now Indian captain Virat Kohli has not reacted to this

 Alam is that 67-year-old Australian wicketkeeper Rodney Marsh, who has played 96 Tests and 92 odis, has instructed Cricket Australia that it could lead to divorce if Wags were not allowed to go on cricket tours with the players
 
 aishez series se thik pehle ritair hue cricketer raaen haris kehete hai ki jab unhone ye khabar suni to unki pehali pratikriya gusse kii thi
 He says that everyone wants to know the reason why the Australian team did not win the ashes
 unke mutabik team ne acha pradarshan nahin kiya kyonki, wo us din achche nahin the
 They say that they are surprised that girls are believed to be the reason for not performing in the year 2015

 mere liye, apane divangat pita rajeev gandhi par pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tuchh tippanee kaa jawaab dene ke maamle main rahul gandhi vijeta banakar ubhare hai
 At a rally on Saturday, Modi said, 'your father's lifetime as a corrupt number one has ended
 'spasht he ki modi ko kabhi bhi kisi mritak vyakti ke bare main galat bolte nahin suna gaya, rajeev gandhi ke alaava jinaki hatya kar di gai thi
 But in New India, where the level of public rhetoric has steadily fallen, this stance is excessive

 Responding on Twitter, Rahul Gandhi made it clear that he would not accept any objectionable comments about his father's legacy
 chunaav ab bhi ek pratiyogita hai or vah ab bhi apni us baat par kaayam hai ki wo apane kisi bhi virdohi se nafrat nahin karte, piem modi se bhi nahin, jo gandhi parivaar par nijee hamale karte rahete hai
 See his tweet
 Modi Ji, The battle is over
 Your Karma awaits you
 Projecting your inner beliefs about yourself onto my father won't protect you
 All my love and a huge hug
 It was Gandhi who dealt with the rude comments of the PM very effectively
 pichley varsh july ke maheene main sansad main piem modi ko gale lagane kii tulana main rahul gandhi kaa yah jawaab zyada vajandaar rahaa
 The incident of Rahul Gandhi's embrace of PM Modi was repulsed when after that he was seen eyeing his friend and party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia
 rahul gandhi kaa aaj kaa jawaab bataata he ki raajnneeti main apni anicchhuk or dhimi shuruyaat ke baad ab wo kitne paripakv ho chuke hai - ek aisi shuruyaat jiske bare main aalochak kehete hai ki wo kai varshon tak chali or jise congress kii tulana main kam chaapluus party main jagah nahin mili hoti
 But now it seems that Gandhi has understood how to reply to Modi
 udhaaharan ke liye unke 'chaukeedaar chor he' naare kaa istemaal mamata banerjee ne bhi apni reliyon main kiya
 Certainly, the image of the global leader, Modi, who was working very hard, has become worse after this campaign

 What is strengthening Rahul Gandhi from within is probably the unexpected support from Mayawati, who had ousted the Congress from the alliance with Akhilesh Yadav against the BJP in Uttar Pradesh
 shinavaar ko modi ne saarvajanik rup se kaha ki akhilesh yadav congress ke saath milakar mayawati ke khilaaf sajeesh kar rahe hai
 On Sunday, Mayawati responded, saying, 'PM Modi is trying to divide the SP and the BSP to save himself and his image as the BJP is losing the election

 The BJP has lashed out at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for apologizing to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in a defamation case
 isse pehle bikram majithia or nitin gadakari se maafee maangane par bhi bijepi ne kejariwal par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari said that Arvind Kejriwal is seen as the most incredible leader of the country today after his public life of just six years
 tiwari ne kaha kickejarivalka apni bhrashtachar virdohi yoddha kii chhavi dikhaane ke peeche kaa makasad janata ko gumraah karnaa tha
 For this, he made baseless allegations against frozen leaders like Arun Jaitley, Nitin Gadkari and Bikramjit Majithia, but as soon as the leaders sent a defamation notice to Kejriwal against the false allegations leveled against them, they had to apologize
 dilli bijepi adhyaksh ne aarope lagaaya ki congress ke shasankaal main netaaon ke bhrashtachar ke khilaaf janata main jo gussa tha, uskaa kejariwal ne phayda uthaaya or ek ke baad ek jhuthe aarope lagaate chale gaye, jiskaa nateeja yah hua ki aaj kejariwal ko sabase maafee maangani pad rahi he
 Manoj Tiwari said that Arvind Kejriwal's petty politics of maligning opponents by making false accusations is the result that today he has put the credibility of not only his own but the entire political world at stake
 tiwari ne kejariwal par aarope lagate hue kaha ki dilli ke vikaas kaa mudda ho yaa phir vartmaan ceiling kii samasya, kejariwal donon hi nahin sambhaal paae
 He said that the AAP mlas are guilty of harassment and forgery of women, causing disappointment among the people of Delhi and Arvind Kejriwal's credibility among the public has completely come to an end after Kejriwal's repeated apologies
 maaloom ho ki vittamantri arun jetali ne kejariwal samet aam aadmi party ke netaaon par manahani kaa mukadmaa daayar kiya tha

 Aamir Khan's film Dangal and Secret Superstar actress Zaira Wasim's decision to leave Bollywood has left everyone shocked
 jaayra ne apane is faisle kaa elaan soshal media par ek 6 pannon kaa letters post karke kiya
 He cited the deviation from religion as the reason for leaving the film world
 jaayra ke faisle se jahaan log hairaan hai vahiin naaraaz bhi hai
 While many stars of the Bollywood industry are blaming them, many are also supporting them
 itnaa hi nahin jaayra kaa ye faisla phens ke saath-saath raajnneetik dalon ke bich bhi charchaa main he
 Some leaders of the Congress and the National Conference supported Zaira's decision as personal
 vahiin shiv sena kii priyanka chaturvedi ne is maamle main alag bayaan diya
 Priyanka blamed Kashmiri separatists behind Zaira's decision
 priyanka ne twitor par ek ke baad ek kai twit main kaha, thik he jaayra wasim ne film industry ko chhod diya or desh unhen aage aane vaale samay ke liye shubhakamanaayen detaa he
 But it is wrong to hold religion responsible for this
 hindi cinema main unheen ke dharm kii kai adaakaaraayein rahi hai, jinhone apni alag pahchaan banaakar sabhi ko garvit kiya he
 In such a situation, it is wrong for Zaira to leave the film industry in the name of religion
 Zaira Wasim moving on from film industry is alright and the country wishes her well
 To each their own calling
 However it was unfortunate to read in her letter that the decision was taken on the basis of her belief that it hinders her to practise her faith
 - Priyanka Chaturvedi (@ priyankac19) July 1, 2019 Hindi cinema has seen many success stories of people from the same faith, does her reason imply that all these stalwarts did not know their religion? Some equate her decision to that of Vinod Khanna, did he says his religion says that his choice of career blocks his faith? - Priyanka Chaturvedi (@ priyankac19) July 1, 2019 Priyanka raised doubts about the threat of Kashmiri separatists behind Zaira's leaving the film
 priyanka chaturvedi ne india today kii ek puraani report twit kar likhaa, "jo log nusrat ke fatve se jaayra kii tulana kar rahe hai, wo yaad rakhen ki jab se jaayra ne hindi film industry main kadam rakhaa he tabhi se wo lagaataar kashmiri hard liners ke nishane par bani hui hai
 "let me tell you that the report of India Today shared by Priyanka tells how Zaira Wasim is the fourth young girl from Kashmir who received threats from Kashmiri hard liners
 jaayra se pehle ek rock band main saath kaam karne vaali kashmir kii teen ladakiyon ne apane khilaaf fatve jari hone or logon kii aalochana or dhamkiyon ko paane ke baad apane mujeec kariyar ko alivada kah diya tha
 Also to those who compare it to @ nusratchirpsfatwa, it is another worms comparison, please remember ever since Zaira joined the Hindi Film Industry she has been under constant attack from Kashmiri hard liners
 https: / / t
 co / 5owzd5htxu — Priyanka Chaturvedi (@ priyankac19) July 1, 2019 Please practice your faith, if it is your calling, but do not use it to make your religion sound intolerant to career choices, which it clearly isn't
 This actually does a huge disservice to her religion & reinforces the narrative about Islam being intolerant
 - Priyanka Chaturvedi (@ priyankac19) July 1, 2019 Remind that some time ago when Zaira Wasim met Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, many local people criticized her
 iske baad bollywood ke alaava kai or stars ne jaayra kaa saport kiya tha
 However, Zaira later issued an apology for this meeting
 priyanka chaturvedi ne yah bhi likhaa ki apane dharm ke saath raho, lekin iskaa istemaal ye kehane ke liye naa karo ki ye dharm kariyar ke virodh main he
 This is a great insult to your religion
 vaise jaayra ne bollywood chhodane ke faisle ko lekar kah chuki hai ki wo apane kariyar se khush thim, lekin apni nai jindagi ko jeene main mushkil ho rahi thi
 Along with this, she was also getting away from her religion
 unhone likhaa ki wo ab apni jindagi industry se dur jeena chaahati hai jahaan unke imaan kaa koi nuksaan naa ho

 Justice BV Pinto granted Yeddyurappa's bail plea on the condition that he file a bond of five lakh rupees and not try to tamper with the evidence
 yediurppa ko 15 aktubar ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 Yeddyurappa was granted bail on a third private complaint filed against him for alleged irregularity in non-notification of government land for his family members
 unhen paanch din pehle isi tarah ke aaropon main duusari shikaayat par bhi jamaanat mil gai thi
 The judge also granted bail to former minister SN Krishnaya Shetty

 On October 15, the bail applications of Yeddyurappa and Shetty were rejected by the special court of the Lokayukta and sent them to judicial custody
 yediurppa or shetty kii jamaanat yachikaaon par faisla sunaate hue nyaayamurti pinto ne kaha ki nichali adaalat ne is baat par vichaar nahin kiya ki shikayatakartaaon dwaara daakhil kiye gaye dastavej vaid hai yaa nahin, isliye unki jaanch kii jaani chahie

 When Deepak Mittal, Joint Secretary in the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, refused to join hands with Pakistan's Attorney General Anwar Mansoor Khan
 darasal, isije main bahes se pehle donon deshon ke pratinidhi ek duusare se mil rahe the
 Then Pakistan's AG Anwar Mansoor Khan raised his hand towards Indian diplomat Deepak Mittal, but Mittal bowed with folded hands, not shaking hands
 hegg sthit antarrashtriya nyaay adaalat (isije) main 18 farvari se shuru hone vaali sunwaayee 21 farvari tak jari rahegi
 India is represented by senior advocate Harish Salve at the hearing, while Khwar Qureshi has arrived to defend Pakistan
 bharat kii taraf se jirah kii shuruyaat karte hue harish salve ne kaha ki pakistan ne is maamle main kulbhushan jadhav dwaara 13 baar guzarish ke baavjood counslar acces nahi diya, jo ki vienna sandhi kaa ulanghan he
 Along with this, Salve described Jadhav as innocent, which Pakistan is running propaganda to trap
 harish salve ne vienna sandhi kii vyakhya karte hue tamaam dhaaraon kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki bina counslar acces jadhav kii giraftaar ko gaiyr kanoonee ghoshit kiya janaa chahie
 Deepak Mittal, appearing for India before Harish Salve, said that there was hope among the 1
25 billion Indians by the decision of ICJ
 unhone kaha ki pakistan ne ek nirdosh bhartiya naagarik ke adhikaron hanan karke isije ke ordel kaa thik se paalan nahin kiya
 Pakistan's argument behind not giving counsel access to Kulbhushan Jadhav is that under the bilateral agreement between the two countries, there is no provision of counselor access in spying
 lekin harish salve ne kaha ki vienna sandhi ko draft karne waalon kii kabhi yah manshaa nahin ki jasusi ke cese main anuchhed 36 lagu nahin hoga
 He said that the bilateral agreement between the two countries cannot modify Article 36 of the Vienna Treaty
 gauratlab he ki bhartiya nausena ke adhikari kulbhushan jadhav ko pakistan kii sainya adaalat ne jasusi ke aaropon main april 2017 main maut kii sajaa sunai thi
 Against which India approached the ICJ in May 2017
 pakistan lagaataar jadhav ko counslar acces dene se inkaar karata rahaa he
 Which is a violation of the 1963 Vienna Treaty on international diplomatic relations

 loksabhaa chunaav-2019 main gorakhpur sansadeey seat se bijepi ne abhinayta ravi kishan shukla ko maidan main utaara he
 Changing the seat of Ravi Kishan's entry and sitting MP Pravin Nishad could change the ethnic arithmetic of Gorkhupar
 ek baar phir upachunaav kii tarah siyaasi sameekaran banate najar aa rahe hai
 Like the by-election in the political struggle of Gorakhpur, the BJP has fielded Brahmin candidates, who are pitted against Rambhual Nishad of the SP-BSP-RLD alliance
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki ravi kishan ke jariye yogi adityanath gorakhpur main bijepi kii 'ghar vaapasi' kara paaenge?raajnneetik visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki gorakhpur ke raajnneetik sameekaran ko dekhen to nishad voters ab mahagathbandhan ke ummidavaar kii ore rukh kar sakate hai
 At the same time, about 2 lakh voters of that caste (sainthwar), who were expected to get tickets from BJP, are in Gorakhpur parliamentary seat
 aise main santhwaar voter bhi bijepi kii pareshaani badha sakate hai
 In such a situation, for the BJP once again, it may face challenges like by-elections
 tay mana ja rahaa tha vidhayak mahendra paal singh kaa tictagorakhpur ke varisht patrkaar ritesh mishra kaa kahana he ki piparich se vidhayak mahendra paal singh kii daavedaari gorakhpur seat se bijepi kii ore se sabase zyada majboot thi
 He also started campaigning in the area
 unka tikat lagbhag tay mana ja rahaa tha, lekin ravi kishan shukla ko ummidavaar banaae jane ke baad yahaan chunaav rochak ho gaya he
 About 3 in Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat
 5 lakh voter nishad jati ke hai
 Now the only strong Nishad candidate from Gorakhpur is of the alliance
 rambhual nishad gorakhpur seat se mahagathbandhan ke ummidavaar hai
 In such a situation, Nishad voters can turn to the candidate of the alliance
 agar praveen nishad ko bijepi gorakhpur seat se ummidavaar banaati to mahagathbandhan kaa vot prabhavit hona tay tha
 Sainthwar Voteritesh Mishra can be cut from BJP, said that the ticket of Pepraich MLA Mahendra Pal Singh from Gorakhupar seat was considered almost fixed
 unhone puri taiyaari bhi kar lee thi
 He was also going to hold meetings in the areas
 santhwaar jati se aane vaale mahendra paal singh kii gramin kshetra main acchhee pakad he
 He is considered close to CM Yogi Adityanath
 ab unka tikat katane ke baad santhwaar matadaataaon kii naaraazgi bijepi se bad sakati he
 While around 2 in Gorakhpur parliamentary constituency
 5 lakh santhwaar matadaata hai
 In such a situation, along with the Nishad community, the sainthwar cuts, then the bjp's path can be difficult
 javabdehi yogi kii hogi, credit hai kaman lengeraajnneetik jaankaron kaa kahana he ki loksabhaa chunaav-2019 main bijepi ne siem yogi ke pasandida ummidavaar ko tikat nahin diya he
 So there is some resentment in their camp
 is naaraazgi kaa rigelt par kya prabhaav hoga, ye kahana abhi mushkil he kyonki chunaav main abhi thodaa vaktaa he
 Well, whatever the result, Yogi Adityanath will be accountable
 haalanki ravi kishan chunaav jitate hai to iskaa credit party ke hai kaman hi lenaa chahega
 If the result is not in favor of BJP, then it will be the responsibility of CM Yogi Adityanath
 gorakhpur main nahin chalaa he star ummidavaaron kaa sicagorakhpur seat se star ummidavaar kabhi kamaal nahin kar paae hai
 In the 2009 elections, Bhojpuri star Manoj Tiwari from Samajwadi Party tried his luck, but he could not save his bail
 manoj tiwari ko siem yogi adityanath ke khilaaf chunaav main munh kii khaani padi thi
 He is currently the President of Delhi BJP
 2014 ke aam chunaavon main manoj tiwari uttar-purvi dilli kshetra se bijepi ke tikat par jite the
 Ravi Kishan's 'shukla' is emphasizing insider Ritesh Mishra says that till now actor Ravi Kishan Shukla has been called Ravi Kishan
 public bhi ravi kishan bulaati he, lekin bijepi se pratyaashee banaae jane ke baad ravi kishan ke shukla hone par jor diya ja rahaa he
 This is a strategy to practice Brahmin vote bank
 unhone kaha ki shahari savarna voter bijepi ke saath hi jayega
 Let me tell you that in the last bypoll, BJP had fielded Brahmin candidate Upendra Dutt Shukla from Gorakhpur seat
 unhen 464632 vot mili the
 Pravin Nishad was a candidate of the SP-BSP alliance in the by-election
 unhen 454613 vot mili the

 Describing the 26 November attack on Mumbai as sponsored by the Government of Pakistan, the prosecution started its final arguments in the case on Tuesday, saying that the neighboring country's army was also involved in the attack
 vishesh lok abhiyojak ujjwal nikam ne kaha, ‘26 november ke hamale kii sajeesh pakistan main rachi gai thi or is baat kaa nishkarsh nishchit taur par nikaala ja saktaa he ki hamalaa rajya pryojit tha
 According to the prosecution, lashkar-e-taiba was given military and intelligence training by Kasab and other killed terrorists, which was supervised by some officers of the Pakistani Army
 nikam ne kaha, ‘kasaab ne apane ikbaalia bayaan main kaha he ki prashikshan ke dauraan ek major general upasthit tha or usne unki nigaraanee kii
 The name of that Major General was not deliberately disclosed to the attackers as he was in a high position in the army
 ’lashkar or sena ke bich santhganth kaa aarope lagaate hue abhiyojan paksh ne kaha ki jaanboojhkar hamale main pakistan kii sanliptata ko chhipaane kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Nikam argued, "the attackers were given fake identity cards of fictional Indian names
" aatankwaadiyon main se ek imran babbar ne ek televijan samachar channel se sampark kiya tha or usne daawa kiya tha ki vah bharat main hyderabad main he
 The prosecution said that the main conspirators of this attack had instructed the terrorists not to disclose their true identity and nationality so that Pakistan's name would not be revealed in the attack
 nikam ne kaha, ‘ab tak pakistan ne hamale kii jimmedaari lene se inkaar kiya he or maare gaye 9 aatankwaadiyon ke shavon par daawa nahin kiya he
 Nikam argued that Pakistani citizen Mohammad Iqbal had paid for the voip account opened before the attack

 Dhoni then called some 'kaka' (trainer Ramesh Mane) and asked him to arrange the ticket for me
 kaaka ne turant mujhe compcementary paas de diya
 Bashir was very happy talking to Dhoni
 unhone final match kaa paas dikhaate hue kaha, unhone (dhoni ne) mere bare main poocha or maine unhen bataaya ki main chicago main rahata hum

 — sachin tendulkar (@sachin_rt)march 3, 2016 Indian institutions already had information that American journalist Seymour Hersh, who accused former Prime Minister Morarji Desai of being a CIA spy, had approached some Indian officials before making such serious allegations in his book
 haal hi main saamne aae videsh mantralay ke dastavejon ke anusaar tatkaaleen videsh mantri pivi narsingh raav ne 1983 main sansad main haalanki yah jaankaree di thi ki harsh ne apni kitaab da price of power : kisinger in da nicksan white house main desai ke khilaaf gambhir aarope lagane se pehle kisi bhartiya adhikari se sampark nahin kiya tha
 The documents also state that Indian diplomats had also indicated to Hersh that the foreign journalist had made a mistake by calling Desai a member of the Indira Gandhi government cabinet in 1971
 pulitzer puraskaar vijeta patrkaar ne apni kitaab main aarope lagaaya tha ki desai siie ke ati mahatvapurn jasoos the or agency ne unhen 1971 main bharat-paak yuddh ke dauraan jaankaree dene ke liye 20 hajaar dollar vaarshik die gaye the
 According to a note recorded on the dispute in the Foreign Ministry file, however, Hersh kept in touch with the embassy as it is common practice in the US to keep in touch with well-known journalists
 is tarah ke anaupchaarik samparkon main hamaare kuch adhikariyon ko aaropon ke bare main bataaya gaya tha jinhone sanket diya tha ki us avadhi (1971) ke dauraan morarji desai cabinet main bhi nahin the
 The note was part of preparations for a discussion on this issue on August 18, 1983 in Parliament
 is paragraph par keval videsh mantri kii jaankaree ke liye likhaa tha
 Which Narasimha Rao allegedly did not convey to the House
 harsh ne apni 450 pannon kii kitaab main daawa kiya ki desai siie ke jasoos the jinhen uske liye paisa miltaa tha or agency unhen apni bahut mahatvapurn puunji maanati thi
 He also mentioned that former CIA officials called the Indian leader a star performer, on whose information the then US President Richard Nixon's administration justified his harsh stance towards India during the indo-pak war in 1971
 1986 main 90 saal ke rahe desai ne apane upar lage aaropon ko khaarij kar diya tha
 He claimed a defamation of $ 100 million against the journalist through his lawyer Mahendra Mehta in the US district court in Illinois
 mehta ko khud 1975 main dhokhadhadi kaa doshi tehraakar ek saal ke liye jail bheja gaya tha
 Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and then CIA Director Richard Helms even went on to state that Desai never worked for the CIA in any way and was not paid in any way
 haalanki harsh se pehle kai tarah ke aarope lage the
 In 1979 Daniel Moynihan, former US ambassador to India, alleged in his book a Dangerous Place that the US intervened twice in Indian politics and gave money to the Congress Party
 ek baar to dhan sidhe indira gandhi ko diye jane kaa aarope lagaaya gaya jo us samay party kii padaadhikari thim
 Desai lost the case in 1992
 1979 main prakashit ek or pustak da main vu cept sicrates main lekhak thomas powers ne bhi aarope lagaaya tha ki 1971 main bhartiya cabinet ke ek sutara ne america ko jaankaree di thi
 Such allegations were also included in the memoirs of Nixon and Kissinger

 tab isamen iske pichley saal ke mukaable 8 fisadi kii giravat ai thi
 That is, before this, the decline in the number of Indians going to America was seen about eight years ago
 asal main vah mandi kaa daur tha jisamen duniya bhar ke yatri, corporate jagat ke log, kaarobaari or anya log apni yatraaon main katautee kar rahe the
 But since then, the number of Indians going to America continuously was increasing

 haal ke varshon main yah dharna bani he ki america janaa thodaa kathin ho gaya he, kyonki kai deshon ke logon ke vahaan jane par kai tarah ke pratibandh lagaae gaye hai
 Experts say that this is a misconception and America always keeps its doors open for the right travelers
 gauratlab he ki america aamtaur par zyaadaatar bharatiyon ko 10 se 11 hajaar kii fees lekar 10 saal ke liye touritst categiri main multiple entry vija detaa he
 Experts say that compared to this, the visa charge of European countries is higher

 Rishi Kapoor has made many revelations in his autobiography 'khullam Khulla'
 kitaab main unhone ranbir kapur kii apni kaam ko lekar nishtha ke bare main bhi bataaya he
 Rishi Kapoor has written - His dedication to work is extraordinary
 janvari 2014 main soshal media or print media khabaren chalaa rahi thi ki ranbir, katrina ke saath neuyork new year manaane ja rahe hai, lekin yah koi nahin jaanata tha ki wo apni aane vaali film (jagga jasoos) ke liye haklaana siikhnaa chaahate the
 So he had his name rewritten at the Acting School in New York
 
 
 
 When Ranbir's great grandfather made it to the girlfriend's house, my sister Ritu was very happy when she heard this
 unhone kaha, wo bahut bade star hai
 They do not need to go to any school to learn acting
 lekin ranbir aise hi hai
 They get ready for their roles
 mujhe yaad he jab wo 'bombai velvet' ke liye boxing kii practice kar rahe the
 Weights were lying everywhere in the house
 mahiraa ke bachaav main aae ranbir, kaha- wo aurat hai sirf isliye unhen jaj naa karence kahuun to main ranbir ke kaam ko jaj karne ke liye sahi insaan nahin hum
 i watch his movies, but i don't like them
 main hameshaa actor ke taur par unke kaam kii samiksha karata hum, pita kii haisiyat se nahin
 However, Neetu knows which film will run and which will not
 shukr he ki main bahut baar galat siddh hua hum

 About 10,000 species of birds still roam this earth, that too in the form of birds

 oxford vishvavidhyalay main bhu-vigyaan vibhaag ke roger benson ne bataaya ki shodh ke dauraan dianasor ke shariron ke adhyayan main kuch haroonges baaten saamne ain hai
 This interesting change has been noticed especially in the dinosaurs with species named Maniraporatans
 dianasor kii kai duusari prajatiyon main bhi yah badlaav dikhaa he, jisamen velokirapter bhi shaamil hai
 a joint international team from the University of Oxford and the Royal Ontario Museum came to this conclusion after studying the thickness of the legs of 426 species of dinosaurs

 shodhakartaaon ke anusaar, dianasor apni utpatti ke kuch samay baad hi yani ki kareeb 220 karod saal pehle apane sharir ko badalane kii prakriya shuru kar chuke the
 Although this process slowed down again, the evolution of the species was close to that of birds, which continued for the next 170 million years
 royal onterio sangrahalay ke david evan ne bataaya kii is shodh main jo sabase rochak baat saamne ai, vah yah he ki kaise or kitni teji se diansor kii prajatiyon ne samay ke mutabik khud ko dhaal liya or ve aaj bhi hamaare bich hai
 However, many species also failed in this evolutionary sequence and went extinct
 plastic mani kaa jamaana he
 In such a situation, what will you do if plastic eggs are also sold in the market

 Anita, who lives in the Park Circus area, brought 12 eggs from a shop

 andey jab kharide the to mujhe pehali najar main kuch alag lage lekin maine adhik dhyaan nahin diya
 Yesterday when i was breaking the egg shell to make omelette, i noticed that its inner surface was plastic
 anjaane main main apane bachche ko ye hanikaarak andey khilaati rahi
 'when Anita burnt the upper shell of the egg, it gave off the same smell as smoke, when it comes to burning the plastic
 anitha ke mutabik jab bhi aise andey ko todaa jaataa he to uski pili zardi safed vaale hisse main mil jaati he
 The shell of these fake eggs is thin
 anitha ne sthaneey police thane main isaki report darj karai he
 According to Anita, the police has said that whatever necessary action will be taken after the eggs are examined
 police pataa lagane kii koshish karegi ki ye andey kahaan se aae
 According to Anita, before feeding eggs to children, they should check whether they are real or fake

 goa police ne panaji ke ek dance baar main chapa markar uttar pradesh ke vidhayak mahendra singh samet chah logon ko giraftaar kar liya

 The comments prabhudesai ne bataaya ki police ne mahendra singh kii giraftaar ke bare main uttar pradesh vidhansabha ke adhyaksh ko pehle hi suchit kar diya he, jo kanoon ke tahat anivaary he
 Mahendra Singh became MLA from Sitapur for the fourth time

 bollywood abhinayta nasiruddin shah bulandshahr hinsa par apane bayaan ko lekar lagaataar bhartiya janata party (bijepi) netaaon ke nishane par hai
 BJP MLA Surendra Singh, from Baria in Uttar Pradesh, who is often in the discussion regarding his controversial statements, has advised Nasiruddin Shah to move to Pakistan
 unhone kaha he ki shah kii maansikta bhartiya nahin he
 They go to Pakistan
 unke air tikat va vija kaa prabandh main karuunga
 In fact, recently, Bollywood actor Naseeruddin Shah had made a statement referring to the Bulandshahr violence, that in today's era cow's life is more valuable than an inspector
 kyonki unhone apane bacchon ko kabhi majahabi talim nahin di
 So they are concerned about the safety of their children, that if tomorrow the crowd asks them what their religion is, then they will not be able to tell
 shah ke is bayaan kii chautaraf ninda hui thi

 jharkhand ke adivasee ilaakon se maanav taskari kar desh ke alag-alag mahanagaron main nae umr ke ladke-ladakiyon ko laane kaa silsilaa vakt ke saath na sirf badha he, balki or majboot hua he
 Placement agencies are playing a dangerous role in this business of human trafficking
 in agenciyon ke log dilli se lekar jharkhand tak main faile hai
 Who trap the girls from there to bring them to Delhi, settle and then weave a whole network of jobs in a kothi
 kai baar to ye agent ladakiyon ke abhibhavakon ko bhi 10,000-20,000 ru
 Gives in the name of advance
 lekin ye advance kii rakam darasal vah laalach hota he, jise garibi ke shikaar gaanvon ke log aksar advance samajhakar rakh lete hai
 If an agent traps a girl in her love trap in the villages, then she does not even have to pay money to the girl's guardian
 bas, ladki ko shaadi kaa khwab bhar dikhaanaa hota he
 One dangerous thing of this false love is that with such girls, these agents often establish a physical relationship by talking emotionally and then continue with them even after being brought to Delhi
 dilli aane ke baad pehali kadi kaa kaam khatm ho jaataa he
 The agent, who has 'bought' the girl from her parents, now transfers the girl to the owner of a placement agency sitting in a Delhi shop and often charges double the amount she is employed for
 dilli main placement agency chalaane waalon ne shakurpur, vikaspuri, uttam nagar, sangam vihaar, kusumpur pahari, pitampura, kanjhawala, narela jaise kai rihaayshi ilaakon or bastiyon main kiraye par kamare le rakhe hai
 Where the girls brought from the villages are kept for a few days and then as soon as a customer is found, these girls are handed over to them and a huge amount is charged in the name of commission
 sachaai to yah he ki zyaadaatar ladakiyon ko kaam par bheje jane kii jagah, kaam kaa swaroop, tankhwaah or chuttee jaisi apni haq kii baton ke bare main kuch bhi pataa nahin hota
 And often in the hurry of work, she gets trapped in the cells
 maanav taskari kii duniya kaa yah sach ek arse se duniya ke saamne he
 But still neither the police has any strong law regarding placement agencies nor any other government department
 haalanki dilli hycourt ne saal 2009 main die gaye apane ek faisle main sabhi placement agenciyon ko shram vibhaag se registerd karwaane kii baat kahi thi
 But this order did not comply
 kanoon sirf ek hi taraf nahin tut rahaa
 For example in Delhi, the minimum monthly salary of a girl is Rs 7,200
 hona chahie
 But the reality is that most girls have a salary of Rs 2,000
 kaa aankada bhi paar nahin kar paata
 In such a situation, whenever a girl demands more money, she is counted and silenced
 chunki trephiking ke is puure dushchakr main dhandhebaaj gaanvon se dilli tak kaa safar trainon se hi puraa karte hai, is maamle main railway police kaa role bhi ahm ho jaataa he
 Sanjay Bhatia, Railways, DCP, Delhi, says, “we have asked our people to keep a close watch on the stations
 taaki koi bhi maanav taskar kisi ladki ko bahala-phuslaa kar yahaan laate hue dikhne par karrwai kii ja sake
 We have also caught many people at stations
 ” lekin bhaatia ke daavon se alag zyaadaatar taskar steshnon se nikalne main kaamyaab bhi ho jate hai
 Probably, there may be a reason behind this, the police not getting complaints directly
 maanav taskari kii maamle main placement agenciyon ke is khule khel ke peeche kamjor kanoon vyavastha sabase ahm vajah he
 No such case has come to light in recent times, in which the owner of a placement agency has been punished for the crime of human trafficking
 alabatta, jo maamle media kii vajah se surkhiyon main aate hai, un maamalon main police agency maalikon ke khilaaf bandhak banane jaise gunahon ke tahat maamla darj bhi karti he
 But when the case starts hearing after a year and a half, by then either the agency owner has managed to negotiate with the girl and get the statement changed, or during the cross examination in the court, these less educated girls will get their old statements But they are unable to sustain
 jisase mulgim aksar bari ho jate hai
 However, a well-known case in Delhi's Dwarka area is still awaiting a verdict in a local court, in which last year a doctor couple moved their 11-year-old maid to Thailand to hang out

 khaskar jab koi dhandhebaaj kisi naaballig kii trephiking main duusari baar pakadaa jaataa he, use aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa ho sakati he
 However, Suman Nalwa, DCP, Crime Against Women Cell in Delhi, says, "the human trafficking situation is getting really dangerous day by day
" ise rokane ke liye naa sirf gramin str par hi nigaraanee jaruri he, balki placement agenciyon ko bhi regaullett karnaa jaruri he
 "actually, reports of these girls disappearing from most rural areas are not recorded in the police stations there and thus there is no official data of this

 ” ab kuch nijee sansthaaon or khaas kar isai mishnariyon ne aisi ladakiyon ke punarvaas ke liye aashray gharon kii shuruyaat kar di he, lekin sarkari ichhashakti ke bina tasviir badalane kii ummid kam hi dikhti he

 Significantly, Azam Khan did not come to participate in Samajwadi Party's National Executive held in Agra

 Indeed, Azam Khan has cited illness for not attending the sp's national executive meeting in Agra
 par party sutara bataate hai ki wo apni sarkaar se naaraaz hai
 The reason for his displeasure is the delay in taking action on the Muzaffarnagar riots
 aisa nahin he ki ajam khan ne apni naaraazgi pehali baar jaahir kii he
 He has also not attended the last 7-8 cabinet meeting of the state government

 shahar kii acchhee socitiyon, coloniyon main rahane vaale log sochate hai ki unka ghar to kaaphi saaf-suthra rahata he, to bhala unke yahaan dengue ke machhar kaise aa sakate hai? yah ek bada bhram he
 The truth is that dengue mosquitoes can be born in any such place and even such a mosquito is enough to make a person a dengue patient
 aksar logon ko lagata he ki dengue kaa machhar gande sthanon par jamaa pani main hoga, jahaan gandagi hogi
 Therefore, it cannot come in their clean house, society
 lekin yah sach nahin he
 Dengue mosquito is produced in clean water inside our house, around our society
 iskaa gandagi se koi matlab nahin he
 Dengue is a disease caused by the bite of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes
 dengue failaane vaali yah khalanaayak yani machhar aapke ghar ke bheetar ke gamalon, cooler, asi main jamaa saaf pani main bhi paidaa ho sakati he
 Dengudengue fever can be quite dangerous, it is a very painful and disabling disease
 is rog main tej bukhaar ke saath sharir par chakatte banane shuru ho jate hai
 There is a lot of pain in the body of the patient, so it is also called bone breaking fever
 dengue kii vajah se kai baar sharir main pani kii kami, lagaataar sharir se khun nikalnaa, platelets ghatana, raktchaap kam hona, rog pratirohak kshamta main kami, liver ko kshati pahunchnaa ityadi bimaariyaan hone lagati hai
 Only one mosquito is enough to spread one hand mosquito disease
 yah jaruri nahin ki aapako lagaataar machhar kaat rahe hon, yaa kai din tak machhar kaaten tab jaakar beemaari kaa sankraman ho
 The bite of an Aedes mosquito can be overwhelming for you
 ek cese study se samajhate hai ki kis tarah se thodi-si laaparvaahee kisi vyakti ko dengue kaa shikaar bana sakati he
 Know the story of Sahil Sahil often used to enjoy the weather in the evening by sitting in his home's balconies
 aise main aksar unhen machhar bhi kaat lete, lekin na to kabhi kuch hua or na unhone isaki parvaah kii
 They used to think that dengue mosquito does not bite at night
 pichley saal march kii baat he
 One day he got a fever
 unhone ise maamuli bukhaar samaj kar ghar main hi maujuud dawa lee or so gaye
 But even the next day, the fever did not come and he started having a severe headache
 tab unhen laga ki kuch gadabad he
 He went to the doctor and on getting a test, it was found that he had dengue
 ek wyk ke andar unki haalat itani kharaab ho gai ki unhen hospital main admit karnaa padaa
 His platelets count had gone below 50 thousand
 fever, badan dard, sir dard, ulti itani pareshaaniyaan hone lageen ki ve dukh se ro padate
 He could not get up from bed for four weeks
 platelets chadhaane pade
 His entire family was very upset
 iske baad ve thik to ho gaye lekin sharir main kaaphi din tak kamajori rahi
 Since then, the condition is that they are afraid of even a mosquito
 unhen yah sabak mil gaya he ki ek machhar ko bhi nazarandaaj karnaa thik nahin he or saavdhaanee hi dengue se bachaav he

 jammu-kashmir ke leh main chunaav adhikariyon ne 14 corps ke jiosi (general Officer Commanding) ko chitthee likhakar kaha he kisena ke kuch adhikari javaanon se puch rahe hai ki vekise vot dena chaahate hai
 There has been a stir after the matter came to light
 haalankisena ne aarope ko jhootha bataaya he
 Army sources say that the charge has been found to be false in the primary investigation and it seems that the allegations were made to tarnish the image of the army
 haalanki abhi puure maamle kii gaharaai se chaanbin chal rahi he
 Let me tell you that another shocking case had come up in Leh itself recently
 press club leh ne aarope lagaaya tha kibhartiya janata party (bjp)ne uske sadasyon ko ‘paison se bhare liphaafon' kii peshkash kar rishwat dene kii koshish kii
 But the BJP denied this, saying the allegations were 'politically motivated'
 haalanki,ek video saamne aayaa, jisase sawaal khadey ho gaye hai
 It is seen in the video that journalists are being given leaflets in the press conference held last week
 sisitivi main bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh rabindra raina patrakaron ke saat dikh rahe hai or party ke vidhayak vikram randhaava patrakaron ko lipaphe thamaate hue dikh rahe hai
 NDTV cannot confirm the veracity of this video

 But the BJP refuted the allegations, saying that they had given an invitation letter to journalists for the rally of Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the area

 In a statement issued on Sunday in response to Nitish's objections against Amit Shah, BJP said that JDU and RJD leaders are tarnishing the image of BJP leaders in the fear of losing the Bihar election
 bayaan main kaha gaya he, bihar chunaav se pehle bijepi kii badhati lokapriyata ne daman ke pratik jediu or 'jangal raaj' ke praneta argedy main baukhalaahat paidaa kar di he, unka chunavi janaadhar simat rahaa he, isliye unke netaa bijepi ke khilaaf jhuthe or niraadhaar aarope laga rahe hai tathaa asansadeey bhashaa kaa prayog kar rahe hai

 Attacking Nitish, the BJP questioned, does Nitish Kumar not consider the fodder scam a case of corruption? Has he forgotten that not only Lalu Yadav, but various RJD mlas have criminal backgrounds? Does he want to take Bihar back to Jungle Raj? amit shah ke khilaaf nitish ke akshepon ke jawaab main ravivaar ko jari bayaan main bijepi ne kaha ki jediu or argedy ke netaa bihar chunaav main haar kii ashanka kii baukhalaahat main bijepi netaaon kii chhavi kharaab kar rahe hai
 The bjp's rising popularity ahead of the Bihar elections has created resentment in the JDU, a symbol of repression and the RJD, the leader of the 'jungle raj', their electoral base has shrunk, hence their leaders false and baseless against the BJP Making accusations and using unparliamentary language
 tippaniyan Dismissing Nitish's allegations against Amit Shah, the BJP said that the court has acquitted them in all the cases in which Congress had misappropriated the investigative agencies and implicated them 
 nitish par hamalaa bolte hue bijepi ne sawaal kiya, kya nitish kumaar chaara ghotaalaa ko bhrashtachar kaa maamla nahin maanate hai? kya vah bhul gaye hai ki na sirf lalu yadav, balki argedy ke vibhinn vidhayakon kii aapraadhik prishthbhumi he? kya vah bihar ko phir se jangal raaj kii ore le janaa chaahate hai?

 Following the footsteps of his uncle Bala Saheb Thackeray, he did the same type of politics
 marathi maanush kii asmita kaa mudda uthaakar vah aage bade
 The workers of his Maharashtra Navnirman Sena rushed and beat the innocent North Indians instead of making any kind of construction
 is tarah se unhone ek bhay kaa maahaul paidaa kiya or sankeern maansikta ke logon kaa dil jeeta
 But gradually their policy was not as fruitful
 loksabhaa chunaav main jab bijepi ne uddhav thakare kii shivasena se haath mila liya to raaj khamosh rahe
 He kept on trying to get wind
 lekin jab chunaav ke parinaam aae to unhen hairaani ke sivaa kuch haath nahin aayaa
 He has since been looking for a chance
 vidhansabha chunaav ke aate hi vah sakriy ho gaye
 He hoped that the BJP would take him along
 lekin aisa nahin hua
 The BJP shied away from them and began negotiating a settlement with the Shiv Sena
 lekin billi ke bhagya se chhinka tutaa
 Both parties were not formed and both agreed to contest separately
 raaj thakare ne is avasar kaa istemaal apni raajnneeti ko chamakaane ke liye karnaa shuru kar diya he
 He is playing the leaf of the Marathi manusha, wants to completely separate the Shiv Sena from the BJP
 unka daanv bahut saaf he
 He wants complete separation between the two so that not only the votes are divided but the Shiv Sena is deprived of becoming a central power
 vah iske liye bala sahib kaa bhi naam uchhaalate dikhte hai or aisa jataane kii koshish karte hai ki vah unke bare main sab kuch jaanate hai
 If that was the case, why did he not understand that Bala Saheb was not going to appoint Uddhav as his successor? Obviously it is a planned politics that is ruling
 unka iraadaa he ki donon partiyaan ek duusare se dur ho jaaen or sarkaar banane main saath nahin rahen
 This will keep their prices high in the post-election market
 donon main jitna duraav hoga, raaj ke liye aage sabase badi party se moltol karnaa utana hi aasaan hoga
 If no party is able to get close to power after the election, there will be a golden opportunity for Raj
 maharashtra kii raajnneeti main vah jagah banane main asafal rahe hai
 Now they have got a big chance
 vah ise haath se nahin jane dengen or shivasena par prahaar karte rahen taaki vah bijepi se dur ho yaa vaise kadam uthaae
 But Uddhav Thackeray is now beginning to understand what is Raj's intention
 unke paas ek paripakv raajnneetijna ke gun nahin hai
 He is not yet completely hot on the stage of politics
 yah chunaav unhen batayega ki raajnneeti kya hoti he
 There are sitting politicians like Sharad Pawar, Chavan, Rane etc
 who are keeping a close eye on them
 jaraa si bhi chook hui or unhone uddhav ko chitt kiya
 Right now he has the sympathy of Bala Saheb's supporters and nothing more
 vahaan ke sthaneey nikaayon main unki party sattarudh he lekin janata uske kaamkaaj se jaraa bhi khush nahin he
 In such a situation, it would be wrong for them to expect too much from the voters
 unhen bahut soch samajhakar pattey chalane honge kyonki saamne pratidwandvi ke rup main unke bhai hi hai jo unki har chaal ko pehle se hi vifal karne ko taiyaar hai

 Modi too has been wearing Khadi for a long time and he has also contributed to making it popular in the country and abroad
