 dekhen video- Before Azad Hindustan, Kashmir used to be a separate princely state
 tab kashmir par dogra rajput vansh ke raja hari singh kaa shashan tha
 The Dogra dynasty had earlier conquered Ladakh to unite the entire princely state

 At that time, the borders of this princely state with a population of 40 lakhs were connected to Afghanistan, Russia and China
 isiilie is riyasat kii khaas ahmiyat thi

 Millions of people were killed in the name of religion and then that paradise was also made into a Jahnum
 jiske raja ne badi ummiido ke saath angrejon se apni riyasat ko hindu-muslim kii siyasat se dur rakhane kii guzarish kii thi
 But the quaid-e-azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who created Pakistan for the Muslims sitting near the borders of his princely state, was not ready for this independence of Kashmir
 unki daleel thi ki jis tarah gujarat ke junagarh main hindu avam kii taadaad ko dekhte hue use hindustan main milaayaa gaya usee tarah kashmir main musalamaanon kii aabaadi ke hisaab se us par sirf or sirf pakistan kaa haq he
 To persuade this insistence, Jinnah started pressuring Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir and stopped the supply of all essential things going to Kashmir
 pakistan kashmir ko apane saath milane ke liye ab takat kaa istemaal karne laga
 Maharaj Hari Singh could not compete with them alone
 ab saaf lagane laga tha ki unke haath se kashmir to jayega, saath hi dogra riyasat kii aan-baan bhi khatm ho jaaegi
 The Indian Army finally decided to merge with India to save the enemy from the Khadedashmir valley from Pakistani terrorists
 bhartiya sena ne dushmano ko khaded kar rakh diya
 Then LOC was born on the last day of this war
 maharaja hari singh ke hindustan ke saath jane ke faisle ke fouran baad bhartiya sena ne kashmir main morcha khol diya
 In the dark of night, India airlifted the army and weapons to Srinagar without directing ATC

 The Indian Army first created a security cordon around Srinagar
 iske baad to jang kii surat badalte der nahin lagi
 The Indian army waved the victory, despite the weak supply of flimsy items and lack of maps, the brave Indian soldiers started repelling Pakistani infiltrators from all the bases
 bhartiya sena ke badhate kadamon kii dhamak ne tab tak kabayaliyon ke dilon main dehshat paidaa kar di thi
 There was a stampede in them
 lihaaja dekhte hi dekhte sena ne baraamula, uri or uske aasapaas ke ilaakon ko waapas kabayaliyon se apane kabje main le liya
 On handling the front, the Indian Army made Pakistan realize that India is much bigger than the Pakistani, not only in size but also in the heartland
 morcha sanbhaalane ke agle kuch maheenon main hi do tihaai kashmir par bhartiya sena kaa kabja ho chukaa tha

 The loc streak was lifted in 1949 after the ceasefire was announced
 yahaan tak ki uske baad pakistan se lagane vaali tamaam sarhadon par jo senaayen tainaat kii gayi wo aaj tak kaayam hai
 From 1949 to 1965, Pakistan used to crack down on Kashmir to grab it
 bhartiya sena ne pakistan ke mansoobon par pheraa paniazadee ke baad ek taraf hindustan tarakkee kii nai oonchaaiyaan chhu rahaa tha to vahiin duusari taraf pakistan ne apni sari takat duniyabar se hathiyaaron ko batorne main juta rakhi thi
 Pakistan did not falter even after a bitter defeat from India and in the guise of Kashmiri jihadis, they surreptitiously rammed their army personnel into the hills of Kargil
 lekin oparation vijay chalaakar bhartiya jambaajon ne dushman ke napak mansoobon par pani pher diya
 However, due to the height of the hills, the Indian army was facing many difficulties in facing the Pakistani terrorists
 lekin bharat ne topon kii garaj ne dushman ke hausale post kar die
 On 26 July 1999, the Indian army had killed Pakistani intruders from Kargil

 Under the agreement, Iran agreed that it would not manufacture nuclear weapons

 President Trump of America has distanced himself from this deal
 america chunaavon main trump ne is deal kii aalochana bhi kii thi or vaada bhi kiya tha ki raashtrapati banane par isse alag ho jaaenge
 They have already separated the US from the Paris Deal on Environment and have now separated the nuclear deal of six countries with Iran

 The facts are under intense scrutiny, the US media is surprised how Trump can make such a big decision on the basis of facts or the facts that are being given

 Now let's move to Iran
 2015 main america, germany, rus, france, china or britain ne milakar iran ke saath ek samjhauta kiya jise Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), kehete hai
 Under the agreement, Iran agreed that it would not manufacture nuclear weapons
 uranium kaa sanvardhan nahin karegaa
 President Trump of America has distanced himself from this deal
 america chunaavon main trump ne is deal kii aalochana bhi kii thi or vaada bhi kiya tha ki raashtrapati banane par isse alag ho jaaenge
 They have already separated the US from the Paris Deal on Environment and have now separated the nuclear deal of six countries with Iran
 trump maanate hai ki iran abhi bhi uranium kaa sanvardhan kar rahaa he yani parmaanu hathiyaar banane kii kshamta uski jari he
 Trump claims he has the facts
 shaayad unka aadhaar israel ke pradhanmantri benyamin netanyahu kaa daawa he jisamen ve kehete hai ki mosaad ke agent ne iran ke parmaanu project se sambandhit aisi bahut si jaankariyaan hasil kii hai
 While the rest of the countries of this deal do not accept the claim of Israel and America
 trump ne kaha ki agar hamane ise nahin roka to duniya ke aatanki sanghathan bhi iran se parmaanu hathiyaar hasil kar lenge
 Trump claims that the deal has a deadline after which Iran will return to its nuclear program
 purv raashtrapati obama ke samay yah deal hui thi, obama ne kaha he ki JCPOA kii sharten bhale hi samay ke saath khatm ho jaaengi, magar aisa hone main 15 se 25 saal tak lag jaaenge
 So there is no need to worry too much
 is deal ko khatm karne main trump ne jitne bhi daawey kiye hai uskaa america akhabaaron main turaki vaa turaki khandan kiya ja rahaa he
 The facts are under intense scrutiny, the US media is surprised how Trump can make such a big decision on the basis of facts or the facts that are being given
 america kah rahaa he ki iran ke saath jo companiyaan kaarobaar karengi un par jurmaana lagegaa
 Critics say Iran will return to the nuclear program if this happens
 trump samarthak kehete hai ki unke kadam ko lekar hangaamaa zyaada hota he, hota kuch nahin he

 It remains to be seen whether diplomacy can be changed on the basis of cultural and religious relations in today's era, how much more their role is in determining diplomatic relations than before
 ab chalate hai iran kii taraf
 In 2015, the United States, Germany, Russia, France, China and the United Kingdom entered into an agreement with Iran called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)
 is samjhaute ke tahat iran ne yah baat maani ki vah parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa nirmaan nahin karegaa
 Will not enrich uranium
 america ke raashtrapati trump ne khud ko is deal se alag kar liya he
 Trump had also criticized the deal in the US elections and promised that he would break away if he became president
 ve isse pehle paryaavaran par hue paris deal se bhi america ko alag kar chuke hai or ab iran ke saath hue chah deshon ke newclear deal se alag kar liya he
 Trump believes that Iran is still promoting uranium, that is, its ability to make nuclear weapons continues
 trump daawa karte hai ki unke paas iske tathy hai
 Perhaps their basis is the claim of Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, in which he says that Mossad's agent has obtained many such information related to Iran's nuclear project
 jabaki is deal ke baaki desh israel or america ke daawey ko nahin maanate hai
 Trump said that if we did not stop it, then the world's terrorist organizations would also acquire nuclear weapons from Iran
 trump daawa karte hai ki is deal kii samay seemaa tay he jiske baad iran apane parmaanu kaarykram par laut aayega
 The deal took place at the time of former President Obama, Obama has said that even though the terms of the JCPOA will end with time, it will take 15 to 25 years for this to happen
 isliye zyaada chintaa karne kii zarurat nahin he
 All the claims that Trump has made in ending this deal are being refuted in American newspapers or turti
 tathyon kii gahan jaanch ho rahi he, america kaa media hairaan he ki kaise bina tathyon ko die yaa jo tathy die ja rahe hai unamem kai trutiyaan hai, iske aadhaar par trump itnaa bada faisla kar sakate hai
 America is saying that companies that do business with Iran will be fined
 aalochak desh kehete hai ki aisa hone par iran waapas parmaanu kaarykram par laut aayega
 Trump supporters say that there is more ruckus about his move, nothing happens
 paris deal ke samay bhi yahi sab kaha gaya lekin hua kuch nahin
 There is also an argument that Trump is trying to spark his declining popularity within the US through foreign policy
 america ke iran ke saath hue qaraar tod dene se bharat par kya asar padegaa
 In India too, concern is being expressed about this incident
 tippaniyan India also imports oil from Iran, followed by Iraq and Saudi Arabia
 isi farvari iran ke raashtrapati hasan ruhani bharat aae the, unhone kaha tha ki agar bharat iran se tel kaa aayaat badhaata he to vah tel ke laane le jane kii keemton main chhot de denge
 It would have made it cheaper for India to buy oil
 america pratibandh ke kaaran agar bharat iran se tel nahin le paaya to uske liye tel kaa aayaat bill kaaphi bada ho jayega
 This will also have an impact on the value of the rupee
 pichley saptaah kii antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemat 76 dollar prati bairal se zyaada ho gai he
 Relations between Iran and the United States are unlikely to improve very quickly
 is janvari se lekar abhi tak dollar ke mukaable rupee kii keemat main 5
 There is a drop of 8 percent
 dollar ke mubaakale rupaya 65 rupee se gikar 67 rupaya 32 paisa ho gaya he
 The Indian rupee is also among the world's worst-performing three currencies
 rus kaa rubal or brazil kaa riyal bhi kharaab pradarshan kar rahaa he
 When the rupee weakens, exporters are happy but importers get upset
 hamane yah jaankaree indian express or hindu akhbaar padhakar likhi he
 If Iran gets caught in the war situation, what will be the effect on India
 kya bharat america ke dabaav kii parvaah na karte hue iran se apane sambandhon or project ko aage badhaata rahegaa, kahin aisa to nahin ki madhya purv main bade str par yuddh ke halaat paidaa ho rahe hai
 Mid-range attacks are possible
 israel ne siria main iran ke thikaanon par bada hamalaa kiya he
 On one side, America, Israel and Saudi Arabia have merged, on the other side Russia Iran and Syria
 kya yahaan se madhya purv main ek bade yuddh kii koi paristhiti paidaa ho sakati he
 Now let's move to Iran

 mere paramamitra narbhasalal sahi main bahut narbhasa gaye hai
 He is entangled in whether farming should be done scientifically or psychologically
 mujhase mashvira lene, mere ghar pahunch gaye hai
 i told him, brother whether to cultivate coriander or paddy, i do not know anything
 maine unhen bataaya ki meri dikkat yah he ki na to main kheti jaanata hum na hi kisi safal khetihar ko
 i have gone to investigate news related to agriculture once or twice but only two things could be known
 pehla to yah ki kheti ab phydemand nahin rahi or duusari baat yah ki kisaan hai to aatmahatya kii ashanka prabal he
 After coming to the Modi government, another new thing came to know by sitting in the air-conditioned room of Delhi itself that the farmer is not just a farmer, he has now got the title of Annadata
 baithe-baithe to mujhe yah bhi pataa chal chukaa he ki kisaan ko uski fasal kii laagat ke mukaable do guni aamadani ho rahi he
 It has already been one and a half times
 haalanki isamen ek pench yah he ki dedh guna yaa do guna aamadani fasal kii vajah se nahin ho rahi he balki diarect cash transfar ke jariye ho rahi he
 i did not know about the direct cash transfer from the farmers
 balki yah baat mujhe akhabaaron main hajaaron karod rupe kharch kar die gaye vigyaapan se pataa chali
 On television, an absolutely farmer-like farmer was saying that the government had given two thousand rupees in advance
 baaki ke 4 hajaar saal khatm hote hote milenge hi
 Narbhaslal's eyes shone on hearing me
 unhone mujhe gale laga liya or bole, "yaar, tumhaare paas jitna nalege he utana to krishi vaigyanikon ko bhi hoga
 "I told him again, brother, what can i tell about farming by sitting in the air-conditioned room in Delhi? This time Narbhaslal got a little annoyed
 unhone kaha, "tum, hamako paagle samajhate ho kya
 The big researcher also does research by soaking in little sweat
 vah bhi air condishand kamare main baithkar research karata he
 Finds an idea to make farming profitable
 or air condishand room kaa dhauns kya dikhaate ho
 a window has been put in such a way that a very heavy man has started understanding himself in the room
 tumse zyada padhaa-likhaa aadmi sab centralined air condishand kamare main baithta he
 From there, the Centralized Scheme for Farmers removes everything
 tumhaari aukaat mujhe maaloom he
 That is why i have come to discuss a little about the cultivation of coriander and you started sowing coriander and spoiling my mood
 ''khayr, narbhasalal kii naaraazgi dur karne ke liye maine unase poocha ki pehle apni baat bataao ki tum dhanie ko lekar chaahate kya ho? bas narbhasalal chaalu ho gaye
 He said, "look, coriander is coriander
 saale ko chheent do khet main
 He has to grow
 nahin ugega to jayega kahaan
 Now what is the meaning of scientific farming for the coriander which has grown from splashing? Dig the soil first in scientific farming, then take it to Samastipur
 mitti ko test karwaao kii dhaniyaan ugega ki nahin
 If it is known in the test that coriander will grow, then plow the fields, make beds
 phir dekhbhaal karo or bhi bahut jhanjhat he
 Doing so will increase the cost of raising coriander
 maan lo ki sarkaar diarect cash trensfar bhi kare to kya phayda
 So i think it is better to cultivate coriander in a psychological way than to cultivate coriander in a scientific way
 "maine poocha ki manovaigyanik tareeke se kya matlab?narbhasalal ne bataanaa shuru kiya
 He said, "well, tell me how much do you know coriander?" i did not understand, so he started telling, "look, coriander is born with poor luck
 ise chaaho to tum badakismat bhi kah sakate ho
 When the coriander grows, it looks very beautiful green
 man lalachaa jaataa he ki dhaniyaan kii chatnee bana duun
 Most of the names of coriander sauce can also be named coriander
 gaanv main to kai auraton ko dhaniyaan kii maai kaa naam miltaa he
 The name of a female laborer in our village was Durga
 uske ghar jo beti paidaa hui uskaa naam dhaniyaan rakhaa gaya
 Durga's name changed from that day
 use ab puraa gaanv dhaniyaan ke maa ke naam se jaanane laga he
 This is the power of coriander
 khayr jab dhaniyaan ugti he to phir haat-bazaar main use ukhaad kar bechney le jate hai
 But look at the luck of the coriander
 dhaniyaan sidhe kharridne ko koi taiyaar nahin hota
 We buy potatoes, brinjals, gourd, pumpkins and vegetables which are kept next to coriander
 or phir dhaniyaan kii badakismati chaalu ho jaati he
 a paav brinjal buyer also insists on giving a small amount of coriander to Fokat
 jisane kilo-do kilo pyaaj kharid liya vah to dhaniyaan par itnaa adhikaar dikhaata he ki maano vah pjaj kharridne vaali kii bandhua majdoor ho
 He carries fifty-five grams of coriander
 badakismat dhaniyaan kii badakismati bechney ke liye to kai dukandaar bhi aage hi rahete hai
 They sell their rotten vegetables by showing green coriander to the customers
 ab taaji dhaniyaan ek pav dene se do kilo sada hua tamaato bik jaae to bhala dikkat kisi
 Seeing me in astonishment, Narbhaslal said, "now begins the psychological cultivation of coriander
 iskaa pehla step he ki dhaniyaan ko dhaniyaan nahin kah kah iske angl bhashaa ke naam koriender se pukaaro
 The word Coriander itself has power
 doosraa step he ki dhaniyaan kii kheti kar rahaa hum yah mat kaho
 Start saying that Coriander is performing
 jaise hi khet farm, kheti farming or dhaniyaan koriender banataa he aap khud ba khud scientific farmar kii shrenee main aa jate hai
 The next step is not to sell coriander, sorry Coriander in the hot market
 use le jaao, air condishand mal ke vegetable shop main
 Put a big board there, Fraise Corriander, Direct Fram Farm
 bas itnaa karnaa he
 By doing so, the coriander itself will become so powerful that it will not need any brinjal or tomato to be sold
 uskaa apana astitv hoga
 Tomatoes or brinjals will also be sold on their own
 jis tarah samaaj main soshal transformension kii jarut he waisi hi subjiyon ke bhi transformation kii jarurat he
 "I found strength in Narbhaslal's talk
 mere chehre par chamak ai
 i liked his idea
 maine kaha, "yaar, tum dhaniyaan kii kheti bilkul hi manovaigyanik tareeke se karo
 "narbhaslal was pleased
 unhone aage kaha, "phir tay hua ki main ab kaariender kii farming kal se hi shuru karata hum
 See you very soon i will be seen on tv akhbaar main meraa naam chhapega
 The story of my struggle from Dhaniya to Carinder will be printed
 jab kisaan aatmahatya kii khabare chhapengi, kisaan andolan se sarkaar ke chehre par sican aegi tab dekhnaa, kisaan kaa ek pasitive chehre ke rup main main desh bhar main chaa jaaoongaa
 The great minister, Santri, will tell the story of my struggle
 yah baat alag he ki chowk-chaoupaalon par, khet-khalihaanon main jab kisaan diarect benifit skim ke paison kaa intjaar karte rahenge main, panchataara hotel ke seminaron main, clab house ke dibet main or form house main hone vaali ayyaas partiyon main gambhir charchaa kaa vishay rahoonga

 (sujith thakur india today ke assistant editor hai)*** If you want to be healthy and fit, then instead of running forward, practice running backwards
 isse jodon ke dard se nijaat milegi or zyada calories kharch hongi
 Experts say that running backwards causes less pressure on the joints, which reduces the problem of knee and back pain and is an easy way to move towards fitness
 oregaan univarsity ke ek adhyayan ke anusaar aage kii taraf daudane vaale logon ke mukaable 80 pratishat urja kharch karke peeche kii taraf daudane vaale log fitness ke samaan laabh arjeet kar sakate hai
 The Daily Mail quoted another study by Stellenbosch University in South Africa that the technique of running backwards also improves heart health
 is adhyayan ke dauraan anusandhankartaaon ne chaatraon par chah saptaah tak saptaah main teen baar peeche kii taraf daudane ke kaarykram ke prabhaavon kaa adhyayan kiya
 With this, a group was asked to continue its normal activities
 adhyayan ke baad yah paaya gaya ki peeche kii taraf daudane vaali chaatraon kii oxygen kii khapat main kaaphi kami ai, jiskaa matlab tha ki shaareerik gatividhiyon ke dauraan vah kam thakeen or unhone ausatan 2
 Reduced body fat by 5 percent
 britain main peeche kii taraf daudane kii res yojit karne vaale james bambar kaa kahana he ki is tarah se daudane ke or bhi kai phaayde hai
 Since running backwards puts your weight on the front part of the foot, this makes your paw stronger and your posture better
 akhbaar ne unke hawaale se kaha ki is tarah kii kasarat se dil behatar rahata he or badan main furti rahati he
 According to Bamber, people who run backwards get the benefit of running for a specified distance, they generally get six times the distance for those who run forward
 isi tarah peeche kii taraf 100 dag bharne se aage kii taraf 1000 dag bharne ke baraabar laabh milte hai

 is baar kul 78 bhartiya parvatarohiyon ko manjuuri mili thi
 Director General of Tourism Department Dandu Raj Ghimire said, 'our attention has been drawn to the misinformation given by the national and international media about the deaths on Mount Everest
 ' unhone kaha ki 'bheedbhad' hone se jaan nahin gayi
 'congestion' occurs when many climbers vie to reach the summit at the same time and it is especially dangerous at altitudes of more than 8000 meters, known as the 'death zone'
 'da himalayan times' kii khabar ke mutabik, vibhaag kaa bayaan aise samay aayaa he jab parvatarohiyon kii suraksha kii andekhi karte hue duniya kii sabase oonchi chotii par chadhane ke liye kaaphi zyada permit jari karne ko lekar uski tikhi aalochana ho rahi he
 According to Ghimire, the post-mortem report of the dead climbers showed that their deaths were caused by altitude-related diseases, weakness or adverse seasonal conditions
 vibhaag ne bayaan main kaha ki usne 2017 main 366 permit jari kiye the, jabaki 2018 main 346 permit die gaye the
 At the same time, 381 permits were issued for climbing this year, which is not a comparatively large difference
 bayaan main kaha gaya, 'isaliye, yah asaty he ki mount everest par bheedbhad kii vajah se parvatarohiyon kii maut hui or ham sabhi se anurodh karte hai ki galat jaankaree ke bahekaave main na aaen

 Director Amar Kaushik says that Shraddha Kapoor and Rajkumar Rao had to face many strange experiences while shooting
 raat kii shooting ke dauraan, madhya pradesh ke ek chote se kasbe chanderi main shooting ke dauraan vahaan ke sthaneey logon ne team ko aagaah kiya ki vah raat ko is sadak par shooting nahin karen
 But the team did not listen to him and kept shooting at night

 Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar said that we had taken action against Jaish terrorists on Tuesday after there was strong evidence, in response to which today (wednesday) Pakistani Air Force attempted to target the Indian Army
 raveesh kumaar ne bataaya ki hamaari vayusena alert par thi, jiske chalate pakistan kii koshish ko naakaam kiya gaya or uske aircraft ko hamaare mig-21 ne dhwast kar diya
 This statement of the Ministry of External Affairs is also an injury to Pakistan's claim that it has not damaged any of our aircraft
 pakistan ke is jhooth kii bharat sarkaar ne kalai khol di he, or videsh mantralay ne spasht kar diya he ki hamaare mig-21 ne pakistani vayusena ke aircraft ko hawa main dhwast kiya he
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar also said that Indian soldiers saw that after the attack on the Pakistani aircraft in the air, it collapsed and was seen falling into the outskirts of Pakistan

 Pakistan Army spokesman Asif Ghafur said that he could have targeted the Indian Army's bases and administrative offices if he wanted, but we did not try to harm anyone

 "kejriwal is a liar," was the comment that at that time all the 42 elected mlas of the Congress and the BJP, in one voice, threw at Kejriwal because they brought the people of the state with the aim of liberating them from all forms of corruption
 Gaya had failed to garner support for his Lokpal Bill and due to this he resigned and sacrificed his government in just 49 days
 uske baad kejariwal ne pichley saal bhar main jo khun, pasinaa or aansu bahaae hai, use dilli ke ramlila maidan main 14 farvari ko jutane vaale hajaaron dilliwaalon kaa hujum or unka nayaa vishwaas shaayad kuch chaiyn de sake
 Then, the embarrassment that he had to face in the Lok Sabha elections at the hands of BJP leader and then Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh last summer, may have given some relief to his wounds, as he was trampled So to receive

 "it must have been less than three years that this NGO activist somehow managed to mobilize a scattered crowd of left-leaning voluntary activists to form the Aam Aadmi Party, which dared Modi's powerful BJP to dare
" ye baaten ab itihaas kaa hissaa hai
 Till just nine months ago, Modi was the name of a man who did not make mistakes
 dilli darbar ke patan se naaraaz ve samooche siyaasi paridrishy par dhongiyon or khandaniyon ko charate hue agiyabatal bane hue the
 However, after becoming the Prime Minister, he got caught in the vicious circle of power so much that he and his BJP became more or less synonymous with the same collapse that was once considered the vassal of the UPA
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki modi ne in nau maheenon main ek pal bhi kisi ghotaale ke jhonke tak ko apane kareeb se nahin guzarane diya he
 In fact, he has been led by the changing perception of the most disadvantaged people that they have now abandoned themselves as a humble tea seller and consider themselves a leader who considers himself equal to most powerful leaders of the world
 dilli main kejariwal ke paksh main pade voton kaa ek bada hissaa beshak modi virdohi daanv tha
 Kejriwal's importance is that AAP has done to Modi what Modi did to the Congress in the past - in Delhi, he gave Modi a nudge that is nothing short of a hammer
 achaanak aisa lag rahaa he ki modi kaa kad chota ho gaya he
 Look at the irony that a man with a muffler is a victim of terrible diabetes and the craze of alternative politics, who has duped a man who wears a bandgala suit embroidered in his name
 philhal sabhyataa kaa takaza he ki kejariwal or modi ke bich ek swaagatyogy samvaad hua he
 The Chief Minister met the Prime Minister two days before his oath and the cameras were seen imprisoning the grin on both faces
 modi haalanki ab tak bhuule nahin hai ki kejariwal ne kaise unheen ke garh gandhinagar main unhen pichley saal march main chunauti di thi
 And in the case of socio-economic data, he was accused of benefiting Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries and Adani Group, breaking the claim of being on top position in Gujarat
 modi or kejariwal ke bich is takkar ko televijan camaron ne jis tarah se nirantar kaid kiya, yah saaf ho chukaa tha ki dilliwaala mafalaraman gujarat ke sardaar ke liye sirdard ban chukaa he
 After the battle of Banaras, Modi had agreed that he had cleaned and cleaned the text called Kejriwal on the wall, but in Delhi, Kejriwal again put the ball in the bjp's court and forced him to give sloppy responses
 gave
 jis party ne pichley saal may main satta pratishthan ko itane saahas ke saath chunauti di thi, ab vah khud satta ban chuki thi or galati par galati kiye ja rahi thi
 Whether it was the decision to postpone the election of Delhi for so long, Modi's magic would have been lost or the decision to suddenly take Kiran Bedi out of the air, irrespective of the feelings of local party leaders and workers in the election , This time there was a lot of mistakes
 aap ke varisht netaa yogendra yadav ke mutabik, ''bedi ko bijepi ne jab utaarne or kaman saunpane kaa faisla kiya to ham samaj chuke the ki ham surakshit hai kyonki bedi khud apane kiye or kahe main fansati jaaengi
 "after the establishment of Modi's rule in the country, for the first time in Delhi elections, it seemed as if Kejriwal was showing us that things had now passed from Modi's hand
" iske baavjood vidhansabha kii kul 70 siton main se 67 par aap kii jeet kaa chunaav parinaam aane ke baad jab kejariwal east patel nagar kii puraani sharnaarthi colony main sthit apane party ke mukhyalay main aap ke samarthakon ke hujum ko sambodhit kar rahe the to aisa laga ki ve zyaadaatar khud se hi baat kar rahe hon, ''congress or bijepi kii aisi haalat aaj unke ahankaar ke kaaran he
 If we become arrogant, people will teach us a similar lesson in five years
 hamen kisi bhi keemat par ahamkaari nahin hona he
 Instead, fold your hands and serve the people of Delhi
 ''apni duusari pari shuru karte vakt kejariwal ko is baat kaa achche se andaja he ki unhen aap se paali gai un mahaan aakankshaon or ummiido par saavdhaanee se khara utarane kii koshish kerani he jo jati, varg or samudaay kii deevaaron ke paar jaati hai
 For example, the new government will have to take swift steps to curb corruption, to prevent theft in power distribution, to eliminate the water mafia and to increase the safety of women by installing a few thousand CCTV cameras
 kejariwal ab paripakv ho chuke hai or icchit lakshya ko hasil karne ke liye zyada dhairya baratane ko taiyaar dikhte hai
 An undisclosed code of conduct is applicable to his crowning party
 pehali, apmaan or vipadaa kii sthiti main bhi dimag thanda rakhana he or bhashaa sanyat banaae rakhni he
 Secondly, the dharna will be used as the last tool of protest, when all kinds of debate, disagreement and ideas are over, not like January of last year when against the inaction of Delhi Police in women harassment cases Chief Minister Kejriwal and his ardent protesters took over the streets around Parliament
 or teesri baat, aap ab jholawale vamapanthiyon kii tarah vyavhaar nahin karegi, jo har vakt inkulab kii firaaq main rahete hai balki baqayada ek bazaar hitaishi party kii tarah vyavhaar karegi jo saarvajanik-nijee model main vishwaas karti he, jahaan paisa saamudayik shauchalay jaisi pahal par kharch kiya jaataa he
 "arvind Deng is like Xiaoping," says Ashutosh, convenor of aap's Delhi unit
 '' unka ishaara china kii communist party ke us netaa kii ore he jisane china ko aarthik sudhaar ke raste par laa khadaa kiya tha
 He says, "he is not interested in whether the cat is black or light, but rather whether it catches a rat or not
" ve beshak is baat main yakeen rakhte hai ki garibon ko aarthik vikaas kaa anivaary hissaa hona chahie lekin ve bazaar kii takaton ko unki bhoomika nibhaane dene ke icchhuk bhi hai
 According to Adarsh shastri, an MLA from Dwarka who has worked with Apple India, the grandson of former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, businessmen like Bajaj Auto's Rajiv Bajaj and Infosys' Narayan Murthy have tried their corporate social responsibility efforts in aap's budget
 Has agreed to provide help from bhrasht netaaon or belgaum kaarobaariyon kii mileebhagat vaale gathjod se lagaataar bojhil hote ja rahe desh ke vaataavaran main raajnneeti kii shakl ko badal dene kaa kejariwal kaa sankalp beshak taaja hawa ke ek jhonke jaisaa he
 Before his swearing-in ceremony, Kejriwal told Aaj Tak in an interview, "traditional political parties associate politics with brokerage or patronage
 ''unhen khud paripakv hone main or aap ko apane saath yahaan tak lekar aane main puraa ek saal kaa vakt laga he
 "till last year, Arvind used to be protesters, whose mood was not really about running a government," a close Kejriwal says
 lekin ek saal kii mehnat ke dauraan hamen kai sabak seekhney ko mili or hamane tay kiya ki hamen lanbaa khelnaa he
 This means that any discussion about aap's future will now be done by the political affairs committee of the party
 arvind is baar khud kahin zyada aatmavishvaas se bhare hai or dur kii soch lekar utre hai
 "how AAP defeated Modi's powerful system is the story of important leaders of AAP who raised the party from ciphers - from booths to polling stations and wards to assembly coordinators and Kejriwal himself - with around 40,000 a whole army of part-time workers is contributed
 ashish talwaar kaa kaam jameen par najar rakhana tha
 He specializes in organizing mass meetings more closely than in large political rallies
 aap ke chune hue ummidavaaron ne kejariwal ke saath chaay yaa khaane ke badale un logon se paisa dilwane kii bhi peshkash kii, jo swechha se paise dena chaahate the
 This method of donations also proved effective
 dilli par dhyaan kendrit karnaa or haryana tathaa maharashtra ke chunaav main hissaa na lene kaa faisla khud kejariwal kaa tha jiske liye unhone yogendra yadav jaise netaa kii asahmati ko bhi darkinar kar diya jo loksabhaa chunaav main gudgaanv se lade the
 Kejriwal believed that it was necessary to channel the party's energy into a state
 dilli iske liye adarsh jagah thi kyonki disambar 2013 main aap ne use apane prayog se hilaa diya tha or loksabhaa chunaav main party ke voton main vastav main 4 fisadi kaa ijapha hua tha, bhale hi rajdhani main saaton siton par bijepi kii jeet hui
 As soon as Sanjay Singh announces that an ideal candidate is identified as having three "c's" - good character (character), no charge of crime (criminality) and corruption (corruption) - Kejriwal folds his hands in the streets of the capital Got out and started apologizing to the people for resigning in 49 days
 ve jahaan kahin gaye, unhone kaha, ''maine galati kii he, gunaah nahin kiya
 "the whole of Delhi was in danger
" aakhir iske pehle kabhi bhi kisi netaa ko maafee maangate kisne dekha yaa suna he?is dauraan ashish khetaan pani, shiksha, yuvaaon, bhoomi se jude masalon or mahilaon kii suraksha par dilli dialog yojit kar rahe the, jisase samvaad kii ek nai parat kaayam ho rahi thi or logon ko lag rahaa tha ki koi party aisi bhi he jo unase poochkar unki jaruraton ko apane vaadon ore ghoshnaaon main jagah de rahi he
 When the AAP leaders campaigned in 13 rural areas of outer Delhi, which had not been lenient for the last time i
e
 in the last assembly election, they made full use of the ordinance issued by the BJP on land acquisition under which the government was used for public experimentation
 There is complete freedom to take the land
 or iske liye kisaanon kii sahmati lene kii baat bhi kanoon se hataa di gai he
 The AAP explained that the government wants to take farmer's land and give it to industrialists and the rich
 isi ke saath ankit laal ne soshal media par ek vrihad abhiyaan kii yojana taiyaar kii or chaatr kaaryakartaaon kii madad se twitor, fasebuk or instagram par jabardast maujuudagi darj karai
 It was challenging bjp's own social media campaign
 kejariwal and company ne jis tarah dilli kii siyaasi jameen kabjai he, usase sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya desh main duusari jagahon par, khaskar bengaluru or mumbai jaise mahanagaron main is jeet kaa koi asar hoga
 On the surface, the satraps opposing the BJP have gained a lot from the victory of Kejriwal
 shivasena pramukh udghav thakare ne to dilli main ise 'tsunami kii lahar' qaraar diya, vahiin trinmul congress ke pravaktaa derek o bryan ne kah daalaa ki 2015 'bhaag modi bhaag' kaa varsh hoga
 Nitish Kumar, while retaining the scope of his fighting in Bihar, congratulated Kejriwal that he has raised a ray of hope
 mamata banerjee ne bhi pehle samarthan or phir jeet kii badhai di
 Mamta said, this is a defeat of arrogance
 aap ke netaa haalanki is baar mili maukey kii ahmiyat ko samaj rahe hai or isiilie ve kisi taatkaalik phaayde ke liye apni uplabdhiyon ko daanv par nahin lagaana chahenge
 a close aide of Kejriwal said that AAP will not contest the municipal elections in Punjab on February 25, nor field anyone in the by-election for Dhuri, even if the local leadership says anything
 unhone haalanki yah mana ki aap 2017 main hone vaale punjab vidhansabha chunaavon kii taiyaari kar sakati he kyonki vahaan uski jameen pehle se taiyaar he-aap ke vahaan chaar saansad hai or rajya main vampanthi partiyon ke sangharshon kaa ek purana or lanbaa itihaas rahaa he
 He told, "we will strengthen ourselves in Delhi first because if we let it loose then our hopes of contesting any next election will be lost and we will not be able to challenge Modi either
 ''isi tarah aap 2017 main mumbai main nagar nikaay ke chunaav nahin ladegi, uttarakhand ke upachunaav main kisi ko nahin utaaregi or bihar main nitish kumaar ko bhi samarthan nahin degi
 The AAP leader emphasized that the party does not want to spread itself in more circles, as it did in the 2014 general elections when Rs 40 crore was spent but there was little to show
 iske alaava, bihar or uttar pradesh ke jati kendrit chunaavon main utarane kii use koi jarurat nahin he kyonki vahaan aap ke paas koi sanghathan nahin he or isiilie vahaan unka koi namelewa tak nahin he
 That is, without strengthening her stronghold Delhi, she will not spread her foot in any other part of the country, even if people active in various mass movements across the country continue to argue anything
 jahaan tak dilli kii baat he, kejariwal ne is baat par dhyaan dilaayaa ki bijepi ne is chunaav main 32
 It has secured 2 per cent votes which means that the support of Modi and BJP is still here which can create a challenge for AAP anytime
 garib tabakon ko ekajute karne ke saath kejariwal jaan rahe the ki unhen apane nae madhyavargeey samarthakon ko bhi yah jataana tha ki ve centre main modi kaa samarthan karte rahenge
 For the time being, this situation is going to improve
 dilli kii ore se sawaal yah he ki aakhir yah kab tak durust rahegaa? kahin kejariwal kaa baagi diene phir se na bhadak uthe or ve prachaar mulya vaale kisi pradarshan ko khadaa na kar den? koun jane, aakhir kab ve ganga main dubkee lagane chal den or usee bahaane modi ko unke hi garh main chunauti de daalen? kejariwal ke mitra is sawaal par kehete hai, ''behatar ho ki ve pehle dilli main yamuna ko saaf karen jo siver ban chuki he
 Now remove the matter of cleaning the Ganges from your mind
 ''baharhaal, pichley 15 maheenon main jab ve duusari baar shapath le rahe hai, to aisa lagata he ki us shahar kii kaman sanbhaalane ke liye unhone apana dobaaraa avishkaar kar daalaa he, jo samooche bharat kaa saar he
 AAP leaders emphasize that they are busy thickening their skin for the challenges that will come in the coming days
 ve achche se jaanate hai ki agar is baar chuke to phir mauka nahin milegaa

 Actually, Sartaj Ahmed is the father of the same terrorist Saifullah, who was killed by the UP ATS during an encounter in Lucknow
 aap unke chehre ko dekhakar andaaza bhi nahin laga sakate ki unhone apana jawan betaa kho diya he
 Sartaj says that who does not love his child
 unhen ek baap hone ke naate apane bete se muhabbat thi
 But who brainwashed him in two and a half months, he did not even understand
 unka kahana he ki jo desh hit main kaam naa kare, aise bete ko ham betaa nahin kah sakate
 a terrorist has no religion, whether it is Hindu or Muslim
 parivaar ne bhi kii thi samajhane kii koshishmangalvaar ko lakhanu ke thakurganj main jo kuch hua use puri duniya ne dekha
 The world saw how the terrorist Aifullah was killed by the UP ATS after firing on both sides for eleven hours
 or duniya ne ye bhi dekha ki kis tarah maut kii us aakiri goli se pehle safullah ke gharavaalon ke zarie usase hathiyaar dalwane kii ek aakiri koshish kii gai thi
 Refusal to take son's body, but on the second day of the incident, the stand taken by Saifullah's father Sartaj Ahmed, is not usually seen
 ji haa, safullaah ke pita ne naa sirf apane mare hue bete kaa munh tak dekhne se inkaar kar diya, balki ye bhi kah diya ki unhen or unke parivaar ko ab apane bete kii laash tak kii zarurat nahin he
 Because the son betrayed the country
 bete ne desh ke khilaaf kaam kiya he
 Perhaps this is the reason that despite being associated with a terrorist, this family of Kanpur has become very high in everyone's eyes
 kuch itnaa upar ki desh ke tamaam aam logon or siyasatdanon se hota hua, khud desh ke grahamantri tak is parivaar or is baap ko salaam kar rahe hai
 Are sympathizing with them
 bhatke hue beton kaa saath dene waalon ko hidaayatye kahani he aatank kii andhi duniya main bhatakate naujavaanon kii, unke hashr kii or is hashr ke baad nazir pesh karne vaale ek pita kii he
 Indeed, Sartaj, the patriotic father of terrorist Saifullah, is proud of India today
 wo kehete hai ki unhen fakhr he, jo faisla unhone liya, wo bilkul sahi he
 Perhaps there are people like Sartaj Ahmed, due to which, despite all the nefarious eyes, India continues
 hindustan kii ganga-jamani tahazeeb kaayam he
 They say that if someone understands the religion of Islam in the right way, then he will also do the same things
 unhone kaha ki jo log apane bhatke hue beton kaa saath de rahe hai, wo ab bhi sanbhal jaaen
 Saifullahkari had left home and his son Saifullah had a lot of conflict with Sartaj two and a half months ago
 gharavaalon ne safullah ko accounting kaa kaam bhi sikhaaya tha
 But his focus was not on work
due to jisaki vajah se ek roj sartaaj ne naa sirf apane bete ko fatkaaraa balki do chaar chaante lagaae
 After this Saifullah left his house in anger after him
 tab sartaaj ne bhi apane beton ke saath milakar ainda safulla ko ghar main naa ghusane dene kaa faisalaa kiya tha
 But Saifullah, who runs away from home, will be visible in front of everyone with this new identity, which he never thought even in dreams

 The news was of a terrorist hiding in a house in Thakurganj

 And in a vigorous encounter that lasted for eleven hours, the police kill terrorist Saifullah hiding in this house

 But this new module of terror has not yet collapsed

 The news was that both the terrorists, including the mastermind of this module, were caught
 upi aties ne saaf kiya ki unhone kanpur ke rahane vaale aatank ke is taaze modul ke mastermind gaus mohammad khan or uske saathi azhar ko giraftaar karne main kamyaabi hasil kar lee he
 Yes, the person who drove all these young men into the dark lane of horror and who escaped from the encounter site on Tuesday at the last moment
 desh ke liye ladane vaala khud ban gaya dushmandesh ke liye dushmano se loha lete-lete wo kab desh kaa dushman ban baitha, ye khud uske gharavaalon ko bhi pataa nahin chalaa
 The mastermind of the Khorasan Module, the arm of the UP Police, is actually a military man who served in the Airforce for sixteen years
 lekin phir achaanak hi usne apni duniya alag kar lee
 He stayed away from the family
 or usee ne hindustan main khurasaan modul kii neenv rakhi
 Till Tuesday, he was present in the same house, that is, before the encounter of Saifullah in Lucknow

 The Uttar Pradesh police may not have found any evidence of this new module of terror being directly connected to ISIS, but these two faces had their own separate place in this new circle of terror, which is named after the Khorasan module
 police kii maane to kanpur kaa rahanevaala purv airman yani airforce karmi gaus mohammad khan kii wo shaks he, jisane hindustan main aatank ke is nae modul kii shuruyaat or ek ke baad ek upi ke kai naujavaanon ko bargalaaya
 According to the family members of Gauss, he lived at an intelligence base in Lucknow, away from his home Kanpur for almost two years
 police se bachane ke liye vah apana naam karan khatri bataaya karata tha
 The Khorasan module exposes the second suspect Azhar in this module, with the supply of explosives and weapons as well as providing accommodation for the terrorists
 madhya pradesh main hue pehle dhamaake ke foran baad aatank ke is modul se jude takreeban saare aatanki beshak ab pakade ja chuke hon
 And this Khorasan module has been exposed, but the things recovered from these suspects and the motives revealed in the inquiries are enough to make the story stand out

 ' On treating the people of Arunachal Pradesh as foreigners in Jama Masjid, Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju says that the treatment of the girl who went to the Jama Masjid in Arunachal Pradesh is not right

 paryaavaran rajya mantri mahesh sharma ne dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii us maang ko lagbhag khaarij kar diya he jisamen kejariwal ne maang kii thi ki dilli main khatarnaak rup dhaaran kar chuke pradooshan ko khatm karne ke liye shahar ke upar helicopteron se pani barsaaya jaae
 Kejriwal had written a letter to the central government demanding that he want to make arrangements to rain water from helicopters to end Delhi's pollution
 is maang ke peeche kejariwal kaa tark yah he ki dilli bhayankar smog kii chapet main isiilie ghira hua he kyonki nami vaali hawa main pradooshan ghulkar dilli ke upar thahar gaya he

 unka kahana tha ki agarhelicopter se panibarasaya jaataa he to pani main ghulkar sara pradooshan neeche aa jayega or hawa saaf ho jaaegi
 Mahesh Sharma has almost ignored Kejriwal's advice and said that before making such unique suggestions, the Delhi government should implement the easy and practical measures to reduce pollution

 unhone kaha ki kejariwal centre sarkaar par ungali to uthaa rahe hai lekin khud dilli sarkaar ne pradooshan ko rokane ke liye jaruri kadam nahin uthaae hai

 gendbaaj acha pradarshan karte hai to ballebaaj unka saath nahin dete or agar ballebaaj acha pradarshan karte hai to gendbaaj or kshetrarakshak unhen dagaa de dete hai
 Overall, the English team has lost four matches so far due to lack of precise strategy to defeat all three departments and India at their home but by winning the last match, they will try to exert their wounds
 is match ko lekar kolkata main khaasaa utsaah he
 The Indian team has not played any international match here for a long time
 march main bhartiya team ko england ke saath vishwa cap kaa group muqabla khelnaa tha lekin taiyaariyaan adhuri rahane ke kaaran vah match bengaluru sthanantarit kar diya gaya tha
 During the festive season, the people of Kolkata have got the gift of a big match, obviously everyone wants to take it and that is why tickets are being seen for this match
 kaali puja ke rang main range kolkata main bhartiya team england ko 5-0 se haraane kaa apana lakshya puraa kar paaegi yaa nahin yah to vakt batayega lekin itnaa tay he ki khelon ko lekar jununee is shahar main mangalvaar ko ek joardaar muqabla khelaa jayega
 Admitting Jaswant Singh, on his talk of Mohammad Ali Jinnah as 'great', has said that his expulsion from the BJP has shown that the party is suffering from a narrow mindset
 jo kuch likhaa wo meri bhaavana habijepi se nishkasit jaswant ne kaha ki party ne ‘jinna: india partishan independence’ kitaab likhe jane ke liye unhen nishkasit kiye jane se pehle manushya ke rup main jinna ke vaiyaktik yogadan or unki raajnneeti ke bich main antar nahin kiya
 Jaswant said that i did not think that the party had such a narrow mindset
 jinna or patel ke bare main itani nervas he ki maine jo kuch likhaa us par karrwai kar daali
 i have a feeling that i picked up on that maybe my former colleagues didn't actually read the book when they sentenced me
 itihaas ke tathyon kaa ullekh kiya haiyah puche jane par ki kya unhone apni kitaab main vallabh bhai patel kii chhavi dhoomil kii he jaswant ne kaha ki maine sirf itihaas ke tathyon kaa ullekh kiya he
 i did not tarnish the image of any symbol
 bhaajapa ke purv netaa ne kaha ki yadi nishkasana shabd kaa istemaal na kiya jaataa or vyaktigat taur par suchit kiya jaataa to unhen acha lagata

 So i read somewhere that there is a Sainik School in Gujarat where one can get admission

 So they said where do you have money? How will you go to Jamnagar? Who will take you to Jamnagar? "let us know that Akshay Kumar recently tweeted a tweet in which he wrote that he is going to do something different
 iske baad logon ne ye kayaas lagane shuru kar die the ki shaayad vah raajnneeti main kadam rakhane ja rahe hai

 Babita Phogat said that today is a big day for her
 unhone kaha ki aaj kaa din isliye khaas he kyonki aaj pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa janmdin he
 On the other hand, a Hindi version of the book written on his family and his biography has been launched
 babita phogot ne kaha ki 2 ghante kii film ke dauraan unke jivan kii puri kahani cinema ke parde par nahin aa pai thi
 For this reason, he hopes that the Struggle of his family will be able to reach among the youth of the whole country through this book
 babita phogot ne kaha ki unhone apni sarkari naukari chhodkar raajnneetik jivan main kadam rakh liya he
 Babita wants to serve the country, society and people of Haryana through politics
 babitha phogot ne kaha ki maine apane khel main hameshaa raashtra ko aage rakhaa he
 For this reason, we decided to join the Bharatiya Janata Party with nationalist thinking
 babita ne kaha ki ve pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kaam or unki rashtraprem kii soch se behad hi prabhavit hai
 Babita Phogat said that she is a fighter and is ready for any fight
 aise main agar unhen aane vaale haryana vidhansabha chunaav main chunaav maidan main utaara jaataa he to wo is raajnneetik ladaai ke liye puri tarah se taiyaar hai
 He hopes that if youth and women like him reach the Vidhan Sabha, then they will be able to raise the issues and issues of youth and women with concrete methods
 kai baar hamen lagata he ki kisi vishvavidhyalay kii samasya isliye he kyonki vahaan swaittata nahin he isliye use swaittata de di jaae
 Whenever there is talk of problems of higher education, autonomy is introduced as an anti-biotic tablet
 lekin aap kisi bhi vishvavidhyalay ko dekhie, chaahe wo privet ho yaa public yani sarkari kya vahaan sarkaar yaa raajnneetik prabhaav se swytt hone kii swatantraaa he
 Why should the government intervene, stop interfering
 kabhi aapane suna he ki vaais chancelar kii niyukti kii prakriya behatar kii jaaegi, unka chayan raajnneetik taur par nahin hoga
 It is also a form of political autonomy that has become frightening
 krantiguru shyaamaji krishna verma kuccha uniwarsity ke chemistry ke professor girin bakshi kaa cheharaa kaala kar diya gaya he
 This is happening for the gurus of India who make the world guru, look at the students who have turned their face black, it will give an idea of the future of India
 aas paas camere bhi hai, phir bhi dar he na lajja
 Teacher's day is on 5 September, but the teacher must have been there for a year
 chaatro kaa aarope tha ki uniwarsity chunaav ke matadaata patr main gadabadi he
 Is it such a big complaint that a professor should be surrounded in such a way and blacken his face
 kuccha uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar ne bataaya ki girin bakshi class main padhaa rahe the, vahaan se inhen khinch kar baahar nikaala gaya or cheharaa kaala kar diya gaya
 Neither the UGC nor the law has given this autonomy, but they have taken it
 akhabaaron main kahin inhen abivibi kaa kaaryakarta likhaa ja rahaa he to kahin samarthak likhaa ja rahaa he
 Whatever these are, Bhuj police have registered a case against 15-20 students
 5 log giraftaar kiye gaye hai
 It is a model of political autonomy that will always be above any autonomy
 ab ham aapako aligarh se ek video dikhaate hai
 a Dalit teacher from Shivdan Singh Inter College posted the newspaper's cutting on Facebook
 maamla thana pahunch gaya
 In the presence of the BJP official there, he was asked for forgiveness, not only that he was forced to touch his feet
 pehle aap video dekhie phir aage detail bataate hai
 Will justice be done in the police station also in such a way that in the presence of a police officer, a teacher will have to apologize after touching his feet
 jab thane tak shikaayat pahunch gai tab kanoon ke hisaab se hona tha magar paanv chune ke liye majaboor kiya gaya or jinka paanv chune ke liye kaha gaya he wo bhaajapa ke mandal adhyaksh kaalicharan goud hai
 They have nothing to do with this college
 yah swaittata raajnneetik satta se aati he yaa ujisi se mili hui he? Satyabhan Singh, who teaches English, posted the cutting of a newspaper titled, "if we want to build the future of India, then crush Brahminism under the feet
" akhbaar main yah kathan swami vivekanand kaa bataaya gaya he
 The crime of sharing it is so great that Satyabhan was forced to delete, Facebook was asked to apologize, even if he was not satisfied, Satyabhan was told to apologize by touching his feet
 vaise swami vivekanand ne chicago ke apane bhaashan main aisa nahin kaha tha ki brahmanwad ko pairon tale kuchal daalo
 We have checked the speech
 kya adhyaaapak satyabhan singh ke saath jo hua usamen jati kaa ahankaar nahin tha ki aalochana kii ek kating kya post kar di unase maafee mangvayi gai or thane main paanv chune ke liye kaha gaya
 Forcing someone to touch their feet among ten people is not a feudalistic and casteist system
 jab thane tak maamla pahunch hi gaya tha to phir kanoon par chhod diya jaataa, vahaan jatigat or saamanti tareeke se paanv chune ke liye kyon majaboor kiya gaya
 Tried to talk to Satyabhan Singh but he is so nervous that he did not talk
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay kii website par aaj ek nayaa act aplod kiya he, jisase pataa chalata he ki sarkaar ujisi khatm kar uski jagah ucch shiksha ayog banane ja rahi he
 Four years later, the need for a new regulatory body is suddenly missed, or it may be needed, but the University Commission of India was not yet waiting for concrete decisions
 maanav sansaadhan kii website par jo aplod hua he uskaa naam he 'the Higher Education Commission Of India (repeal Of UGC Act) Act 2018
 Suggestions have been sought from the public on 7 July 2018 on this act
 itane bade badlaav ke liye janata ko raay dene ke liye sirf 10 din die gaye hai, jise aapako email karnaa he
 The government has written about its intention that it is introducing this act because it is committed to reform the regulatory bodies of education so that higher education institutions can get more autonomy
 swaittata kaa alam ye he ki kya privet or kya sarkari, na to kisi professor ko sawaal karne kii himmat hoti he na kisi vaais chancelar ko
 Political interference is increasing so much that now the ministers decide what will be taught in school and what will be taught in college
 baharhaal yah act aapke saamne he
 Was the UGC not formed for all these purposes, what is special about the purpose of the new Higher Education Commission which was not in the UGC or could not be completed by the UGC
 isse pehle ki aap yakeen kar len ki bharat kii ucch shiksha kii samasyaayein isliye vikaraal ho chuki hai, kyonki ujisi ko samaapt kar nayaa ucch shiksha ayog banane kii zarurat he, yah samajhnaa chahie ki ucch shiksha ayog ke saamne bhi vahi samasyaayein hongi jo ujisi ke saamne hai
 Many years before 2014 and four years after that, the result of the collection of these problems is that today, youths from all over India rush to Delhi University after passing 12th
 bharat main ek lakh shikshakon kii kami he
 Let me show you a form of how governments play with higher education
 ye jo notification aap dekh rahe hai wo jharkhand central uniwarsity kaa he
 On 25 June, it is uploaded on its website that Jharkhand Central University wants to temporarily reinstate 64 assistant professors
 in sabhi ko ekamusth 55000 maheene kii selary di jaaegi
 The job will be temporary
 magar is notification ke 12 ghante ke bheetar ek sudhaar karti he ki ab unhen 55000 nahin, 35000 kii selary milegi
 It is also Central University
 hamane dilli uniwarsity main asthaayee padhaane vaale shikshakon kii selary se tulana kii to vahaan edock padhaane waalon ko 65000 ke kareeb selary milti he
 a university of the same Government of India gives 35000 to someone and 65000 to someone
 madhya pradesh main to uniwarsity or colejo main shikshak 20,000 ke aas paas kii selary par padhaa rahe hai
 If this is not a joke, then what is a joke? 12 ghante ke bheetar vigyaapan main selary 55 hazaar se ghatakar 35000 ho jaati he
 You feel that students of really good quality will give their lives to such a system
 majaburi main de denge lekin kya unka pehla chunaav hoga? 20 agast 2017 ko 'times of india main maanas kii ek report he
 In which the statement of the Minister of Human Resources has been printed that one third of the posts in iits, nits and Universities are vacant
 nai central uniwarsity main to 53
 28 percent of the posts are vacant
 neshnal institute of technolji main 47 pratishat pad khaali hai

 'times of india' kii report main likhaa he ki sarkaar ne sansad ko yah sab jaankaree di he
 You will be aware that more than 70 percent teaching positions are vacant in all the seven AIIMS
 baaki medical collejon ke teaching staff kii list bana rahaa hum, vahaan bhi haalat buree he
 Without a teacher, if you study and become a doctor, there is no need to tell again where this can be amazing
 agast 2017 kii yah report he
 How many posts have been filled at this time, only the HR Minister can tell better
 subah-subah twit kar sakate hai ki central uniwarsity main jo pichley saal tak 6000 se adhik pad khaali the, unamem se kitne par sthaayee niyukti ho chuki he
 i am talking about permanent 20 march 2017 ko maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jawadekar ne kaha tha ki ek saal ke bheetar dilli uniwarsity ke 9000 edock shikshakon ko permanent kar diya gaya
 Is going to be more than a year
 mantriji ko yaad dilaa rahaa hum ki is bare main bhi kal twit kar sakate hai ki 9000 main se kitne edock ko permanent kar chuke hai
 We know it is better to tell right there
 vaise 'times of india' ke mutabik ek april 2017 tak central uniwarsity haryana main 75 fisadi khaali hai
 54 in Delhi University
 75 pratishat pad khaali hai
 Allahabad University has 64 percent vacancies
 bharat main hi 75 pratishat shikshakon ke bina central uniwarsity of haryana chal sakati he yahi jaanane ke liye medhaavi chaatro ko oxfort chhodkar yahaan padhane aana chahie
 You should also enroll your children where there are no teachers
 vaise jahaan bhi karaayenge vahaan shikshak nahin hi honge jo haal he
 By the way, let us tell you that Central University is also considered as autonomous institutions, but every day you see government and political interference there 
 hamane aapako pichley dinon bataaya tha ki raamamanohar lohia avadh uniwarsity main biessi third year ke 80 pratishath chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 56 percent of b
sc first year students have failed
 sthaneey media main chapa tha ki avadh uniwarsity main 80 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye
 According to this, when six lakh students took the exam, then there were four lakh 80 thousand
 vishvavidhyalay ke vaais chancelar ne ise hi mudda bana liya ki jab teen lakh se kuch zyada chaatro ke riselt hi nikle hai to 4 lakh 80 hazaar fail ho gaye
 This was a mistake, but we also said that 80 percent of the BSC third year have failed
 first year main 56 pratishat fail hue hai
 Today when our colleague Pramod Srivastava spoke to Vice Chancellor Manoj Dixit, he could not tell how many students appeared in the exam, the total number of students who failed
 vaais chancelar ne fail ke aankade kam dikhaane ke liye sarkari madad praapt or swavitt poshit college ke nateezon main bantwaaraa kar diya
 They have forgotten that the Vice Chancellors are from government aided colleges as well as self-funded colleges
 ek uniwarsity main kathith rup se nakal rokane ke naam par itani badi sankhya main chaatr fail ho jaae kya yah vishwa vidhyalay kii gunvattta par tippanee nahin he
 What is studied there that fails to stop copying? aaj jab pramod ne visi manoj dikshit se baat kii tab unhone nahin bataaya ki kitne chaatro ne pariksha di thi jabaki 22 farvari ke aas paas press conference main khud kaha tha ki 6 lakh se adhik chaatro ne pariksha di thi
 If six lakh students sit for the exam, will the result be six lakhs or three lakhs? VC Dixit said before Pramod that he did not know how many students sat in the examination, Omprakash will tell you
 baad main pramod shrivastav ne jaanane kii koshish ki to yah pataa chalaa ki ye om prakaash uniwarsity ke koi adhikari nahi hai, kisi pad par nahin hai
 Member of Council for Work
 kaayade se visi ko 19 june ke press relies main hi bataanaa chahie tha jab unhone hamaari siries ke baad jari kiya tha or jisamen sarkari or privet collejon main fail hone vaale chaatro kaa pratishat dikhaaya tha, usamen kyon nahin kaha ki 3 lakh se adhik chaatr pariksha hi nahin dene aae kyonki nakal virdohi abhiyaan chal rahaa tha
 On 22 February, VC said that 6,11680 students would be included in the graduation exam
 3,41000 chaatro kaa rigelt niklaa or isamen se 15-16 pratishat fail ho gaye
 Accordingly, the number of students failing is 54,560
 jab visi se poocha gaya ki imtehaan to 6 lakh se adhik chaatro ne diya to unhone kaha ki baaki chaatr nahin aae
 Accordingly, 2,70680 students did not come to take the exam, it is shameful even to fail
 ab aap fail hone vaale or pariksha nahin dene waalon kii sankhya jodie
 This number is 3, 25,240 students are not eligible to pass
 kya yah kisi uniwarsity ke liye sharmnaak nahin he ki form bharne vaale chaatro main se aadhe yaa to imtahaan dene kaa saahas na juta saken or fail ho jaaen
 By the way, Governor Ramnaik should check that indeed more than 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 students left the examination, and left, then why was it not stated on the website at the time of the result
 aaj tak iskaa zikr nahin he
 In the press release of June 19, VC Dixit could tell that about one-third of the three lakh students did not take the exam
 tippaniyan Many colleges in Avadh University do not have teachers in proportion to the number of students
 manzur padon kii sankhya ke hisaab se bhi shikshak nahin hai
 If this quality education remains, then these universities should be closed because what is app university is going on
 kanpur uniwarsity or bundelkhand uniwarsity ke nateezon kaa bhi bura haal he
 Only 2 lakh 18 thousand 28 students took the exam in BA b
sc and b
com here, out of which 1 lakh 22 thousand 583 students have failed
 kareeb kareeb 50 fisadi chaatr bundelkhand main fail hai
 All the credit is about stopping copying, but when will the quality of studies in the university improve
 kya yah acchhee baat he ki ek uniwarsity main sirf 40 pratishat chaatr paas hon
 So 12 in BSC Part One
 5 pratishat chaatr hi paas hue hai baaki sab fail hai
 Some 26000 students have failed
 biessi part tu main bhi 24000 ke kareeb chaatr fail hai
 It is not known that more than 50,000 students have failed in BSC itself
 bandelkhand uniwarsity main sabhi course main kul milakar 2 lakh 43 hazaar chaatro ne pariksha di thi, jisamen se 95,445 chaatr hi paas hue he
 Everyone else failed
 ye he hamaari ucch shiksha kaa haal
 There are neither teachers nor principals nor students are eligible to pass
 nateeja kya hoga aap samaj sakate hai
 It is also a form of political autonomy that has become frightening
 krantiguru shyaamaji krishna verma kuccha uniwarsity ke chemistry ke professor girin bakshi kaa cheharaa kaala kar diya gaya he
 This is happening for the gurus of India who make the world guru, look at the students who have turned their face black, it will give an idea of the future of India
 aas paas camere bhi hai, phir bhi dar he na lajja
 Teacher's day is on 5 September, but the teacher must have been there for a year
 chaatro kaa aarope tha ki uniwarsity chunaav ke matadaata patr main gadabadi he
 Is it such a big complaint that a professor should be surrounded in such a way and blacken his face
 kuccha uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar ne bataaya ki girin bakshi class main padhaa rahe the, vahaan se inhen khinch kar baahar nikaala gaya or cheharaa kaala kar diya gaya
 Neither the UGC nor the law has given this autonomy, but they have taken it
 akhabaaron main kahin inhen abivibi kaa kaaryakarta likhaa ja rahaa he to kahin samarthak likhaa ja rahaa he
 Whatever these are, Bhuj police have registered a case against 15-20 students
 5 log giraftaar kiye gaye hai
 It is a model of political autonomy that will always be above any autonomy
 ab ham aapako aligarh se ek video dikhaate hai
 a Dalit teacher from Shivdan Singh Inter College posted the newspaper's cutting on Facebook
 maamla thana pahunch gaya
 In the presence of the BJP official there, he was asked for forgiveness, not only that he was forced to touch his feet
 pehle aap video dekhie phir aage detail bataate hai
 Will justice be done in the police station also in such a way that in the presence of a police officer, a teacher will have to apologize after touching his feet
 jab thane tak shikaayat pahunch gai tab kanoon ke hisaab se hona tha magar paanv chune ke liye majaboor kiya gaya or jinka paanv chune ke liye kaha gaya he wo bhaajapa ke mandal adhyaksh kaalicharan goud hai
 They have nothing to do with this college
 yah swaittata raajnneetik satta se aati he yaa ujisi se mili hui he? Satyabhan Singh, who teaches English, posted the cutting of a newspaper titled, "if we want to build the future of India, then crush Brahminism under the feet
" akhbaar main yah kathan swami vivekanand kaa bataaya gaya he
 The crime of sharing it is so great that Satyabhan was forced to delete, Facebook was asked to apologize, even if he was not satisfied, Satyabhan was told to apologize by touching his feet
 vaise swami vivekanand ne chicago ke apane bhaashan main aisa nahin kaha tha ki brahmanwad ko pairon tale kuchal daalo
 We have checked the speech
 kya adhyaaapak satyabhan singh ke saath jo hua usamen jati kaa ahankaar nahin tha ki aalochana kii ek kating kya post kar di unase maafee mangvayi gai or thane main paanv chune ke liye kaha gaya
 Forcing someone to touch their feet among ten people is not a feudalistic and casteist system
 jab thane tak maamla pahunch hi gaya tha to phir kanoon par chhod diya jaataa, vahaan jatigat or saamanti tareeke se paanv chune ke liye kyon majaboor kiya gaya
 Tried to talk to Satyabhan Singh but he is so nervous that he did not talk
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay kii website par aaj ek nayaa act aplod kiya he, jisase pataa chalata he ki sarkaar ujisi khatm kar uski jagah ucch shiksha ayog banane ja rahi he
 Four years later, the need for a new regulatory body is suddenly missed, or it may be needed, but the University Commission of India was not yet waiting for concrete decisions
 maanav sansaadhan kii website par jo aplod hua he uskaa naam he 'the Higher Education Commission Of India (repeal Of UGC Act) Act 2018
 Suggestions have been sought from the public on 7 July 2018 on this act
 itane bade badlaav ke liye janata ko raay dene ke liye sirf 10 din die gaye hai, jise aapako email karnaa he
 The government has written about its intention that it is introducing this act because it is committed to reform the regulatory bodies of education so that higher education institutions can get more autonomy
 swaittata kaa alam ye he ki kya privet or kya sarkari, na to kisi professor ko sawaal karne kii himmat hoti he na kisi vaais chancelar ko
 Political interference is increasing so much that now the ministers decide what will be taught in school and what will be taught in college
 baharhaal yah act aapke saamne he
 Was the UGC not formed for all these purposes, what is special about the purpose of the new Higher Education Commission which was not in the UGC or could not be completed by the UGC
 isse pehle ki aap yakeen kar len ki bharat kii ucch shiksha kii samasyaayein isliye vikaraal ho chuki hai, kyonki ujisi ko samaapt kar nayaa ucch shiksha ayog banane kii zarurat he, yah samajhnaa chahie ki ucch shiksha ayog ke saamne bhi vahi samasyaayein hongi jo ujisi ke saamne hai
 Many years before 2014 and four years after that, the result of the collection of these problems is that today, youths from all over India rush to Delhi University after passing 12th
 bharat main ek lakh shikshakon kii kami he
 Let me show you a form of how governments play with higher education
 ye jo notification aap dekh rahe hai wo jharkhand central uniwarsity kaa he
 On 25 June, it is uploaded on its website that Jharkhand Central University wants to temporarily reinstate 64 assistant professors
 in sabhi ko ekamusth 55000 maheene kii selary di jaaegi
 The job will be temporary
 magar is notification ke 12 ghante ke bheetar ek sudhaar karti he ki ab unhen 55000 nahin, 35000 kii selary milegi
 It is also Central University
 hamane dilli uniwarsity main asthaayee padhaane vaale shikshakon kii selary se tulana kii to vahaan edock padhaane waalon ko 65000 ke kareeb selary milti he
 a university of the same Government of India gives 35000 to someone and 65000 to someone
 madhya pradesh main to uniwarsity or colejo main shikshak 20,000 ke aas paas kii selary par padhaa rahe hai
 If this is not a joke, then what is a joke? 12 ghante ke bheetar vigyaapan main selary 55 hazaar se ghatakar 35000 ho jaati he
 You feel that students of really good quality will give their lives to such a system
 majaburi main de denge lekin kya unka pehla chunaav hoga? 20 agast 2017 ko 'times of india main maanas kii ek report he
 In which the statement of the Minister of Human Resources has been printed that one third of the posts in iits, nits and Universities are vacant
 nai central uniwarsity main to 53
 28 percent of the posts are vacant
 neshnal institute of technolji main 47 pratishat pad khaali hai
 There are 35 percent vacancies in the new and old iits
 im main bhi 26 pratishat pad khaali hai
 At IIM Indore, 51 percent posts are vacant

 You will be aware that more than 70 percent teaching positions are vacant in all the seven AIIMS

 Without a teacher, if you study and become a doctor, there is no need to tell again where this can be amazing
 agast 2017 kii yah report he
 How many posts have been filled at this time, only the HR Minister can tell better

 There are neither teachers nor principals nor students are eligible to pass
 nateeja kya hoga aap samaj sakate hai
 Vice Chancellor of Kutch University told that Girin Bakshi was teaching in class, from there he was pulled out and his face blackened
 yah swaittata na to ujisi ne di he or na hi kanoon ne magar inhone le lee he to le lee he
 Somewhere in the newspapers they are being written as ABVB activists and elsewhere they are being written as supporters
 ye jo bhi hai bhuj police ne 15-20 chaatro ke khilaaf maamla darj kar liya he
 5 people have been arrested
 yah raajnneetik swaittata kaa namoona he jo kisi bhi swytta se upar hameshaa hi rahegi
 Now we show you a video from Aligarh
 shivdaan singh inter college ke ek dalit adhyaaapak ne akhbaar kii kating fasebuk par post kar di
 The matter reached the police station
 vahaan par bijepi ke padaadhikari kii maujuudagi main unase maafee mangvayi gai, yahi nahin unase paanv chune ke liye majaboor kiya gaya
 First you watch the video and then tell the details further
 kya police thane main bhi insaaf ab is tarah se hoga ki police adhikari kii maujuudagi main ek adhyaaapak ko paanv chhukar maafee maangani hogi
 When the complaint reached the police station, it was to be done according to the law but they were forced to touch the feet and those who have been asked to touch their feet are the BJP President Kalicharan Gaur
 unka is college se koi lenaa dena nahin hai
 Does this autonomy come from political power or is it with the UGC? angrezi padhaane vaale satyabhan singh ne ek akhbaar kii kating post kii jiskaa sheershak he ki yadi bharat ke bhavishya kaa nirmaan karnaa he to brahmanwad ko pairon tale kuchal daalo
 This statement has been told in the newspaper by Swami Vivekananda
 ise share karne kaa aparaadh itnaa bada he ki satyabhan ko dilit karne ke liye majaboor kiya gaya, fasebuk par maafee maangane kii baat kahi gai, usase bhi santushti nahin hui to satyabhan se kaha gaya ki ve pair chhu kar maafee maange
 However, Swami Vivekananda did not say in his speech in Chicago that crush Brahminism under foot
 hamane bhaashan check kiya he
 Was there no caste arrogance in what happened to teacher Satyabhan Singh, who posted a cut of criticism, asked for forgiveness and was asked to touch his feet in the police station
 kisi ko das logon ke bich paanv chune ke liye majaboor karnaa samantvaadi or jativaadee vyavastha nahin he to or kya he
 When the matter had reached the police station, then it would have been left to the law, why was it forced to touch the feet in a casteist and feudal manner
 satyabhan singh se baat karne kii koshish kii magar ve itnaa ghabara gaye hai ki baat hi nahin kii
 a new Act has been uploaded on the website of Ministry of Human Resources today, which shows that the government is going to finish UGC and replace it with a Higher Education Commission
 chaar saal baad achaanak ek nae niamak sanstha kii zarurat kii yaad ai he, yaa isaki zarurat ho bhi sakati he magar bharat kii uniwarsity ayog kaa nahin ab tak thos faislon kaa intazaar kar rahi thi
 The name of what has been uploaded on the Human Resources website is' The Higher Education Commission of India (repeal of UGC Act) Act 2018
 is act par janata se 7 july 2018 tak suzav maanga gaya he
 You have been given only 10 days to give public opinion for such a big change, which you have to email
 sarkaar ne apni manshaa ke bare main likhaa he vah yah act isliye pesh kar rahi he kyonki vah shiksha ke niamak sansthaaon main sudhaar ke liye patibaddh he taaki ucch shiksha sansthaanon ko zyada swaittata mil sake
 The idea of autonomy is whether private and whether government, neither a professor dares to question nor a vice chancellor
 raajnneetik hastkshep is kadar badhata ja rahaa he ki ab mantri tay karte hai ki skool main kya padhaayaa jayega or college main kya padhaayaa jayega
 However, this act is in front of you
 kya inhen sab uddeshyon ke liye ujisi kaa gathan nahin hua tha, nae ucch shiksha ayog ke makasad main aisa kya khaas he jo ujisi main nahin tha yaa ujisi se puraa nahin ho saktaa tha
 Before you believe that India's problems of higher education have become huge, because the UGC needs to be abolished and a new Higher Education Commission should be understood, that the Higher Education Commission will also face the same problems that the UGC will face Are in front
 2014 ke pehle ke kai saal or uske baad ke chaar saal se in samasyaon ke sangrah kaa nateeja yah he ki aaj saare bharat ke noujvaan 12veen paas karne ke baad dilli uniwarsity kii taraf bhaagate hai
 There is a shortage of one lakh teachers in India
 sarkarein ucch shiksha ke saath kis tarah khilwaad karti hai uskaa ek rup aapako dikhaata hum
 The notification you are seeing is from Jharkhand Central University
 25 june ko isaki website par aplod hota he ki jharkhand central uniwarsity asthaayee rup se 64 sahaayak prophessoron ko behaal karnaa chaahati he
 All these will be given a salary of 55000 months in lump sum
 naukari asthaayee hogi
 But within 12 hours of this notification, there is an improvement that now they will get salary of 35000, not 55000
 yah bhi central uniwarsity he
 When we compared the salary of the temporary teachers in Delhi University, the adhoc teachers there get around 65000 salary
 ek hi bharat sarkaar kii ek uniwarsity kisi ko 35000 detii he or kisi ko 65000
 In Madhya Pradesh, teachers in universities and colleges are teaching at a salary of around 20,000
 agar ye mazaaq nahin to phir mazaaq kya he
 Within 12 hours, the salary in advertising decreases from 55 thousand to 35000
 aapako lagata he ki vaaki acchhee quality ke chaatr apana jivan aisi vyavastha ko denge
 Will give in compulsion but will he have his first election? On 20 August 2017, there is a report of Manas in the Times of India
 jisamen maanav sansaadhan mantri kaa bayaan chapa he ki iaiti, enaiti or universti main ek tihaai pad khaali hai
 So 53 at New Central University
 28 pratishat pad khaali hai
 National Institute of Technology has 47 percent vacancies
 nae or puraani iaiti main 35 pratishat pad khaali hai
 At IIM too, 26 percent of the posts are vacant
 im indore main to 51 pratishat pad khaali hai
 The Times of India report states that the government has given all this information to the Parliament
 aapako pataa hi hoga ki saaton ames main teaching ke 70 fisadi se adhik pad khaali hai
 i am making a list of teaching staff of other medical colleges, the situation is also bad there
 bina teacher ke aap padhakar doctor ho jaae yah kamaal kahaan ho saktaa he, yah baar-baar bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 This is the report for August 2017
 is vakt kitne pad bhare ja chuke hai maanav sansaadhan mantri hi behatar bataa sakate he
 In the morning, one can tweet that till last year, more than 6000 posts were vacant in Central University, how many of them have got permanent appointment
 permanent kii baat kar rahaa hum
 On 20 March 2017, Human Resource Minister Prakash Javadekar had said that 9000 adhoc teachers of Delhi University were permanent within a year
 ek saal se zyaada hone ja rahaa he
 Reminding the Minister that i can also tweet tomorrow about how many of the 9000 have admanked
 hamen to pataa he behatar he vahiin bataa den
 According to 'times of India', as of April 1, 2017, Central University Haryana has 75 percent vacancies
 dilli uniwarsity main 54
 75 percent posts are vacant
 elahabaad uniwarsity main 64 fisadi pad khaali hai
 In India itself, meritorious students should leave Oxfort and study here to know that Central University of Haryana can run without 75 percent teachers
 aap bhi apane bacchon kaa namakan vahiin karaaen jahaan shikshak nahin hai
 By the way, wherever you do, there will be no teachers, which is the condition
 vaise aapako bataa den ki central uniwarsity bhi swytt sansthaaen maani jaati hai, magar aae din aap vahaan sarkari or raajnneetik hastkshep dekhte rahete hai
 We told you recently that 80 percent of BSC third year students have failed at Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University
 biessi pratham varsh ke 56 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 It was published in the local media that 80 percent of the students at Awadh University failed
 is hisaab se jab chah lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi to chaar lakh 80 hazaar hue
 The Vice Chancellor of the University made it a point that when the results of more than three lakh students have come out, then 4 lakh 80 thousand have failed
 ye chook thi magar hamane ye bhi kaha tha ki biessi third year main 80 pratishat fail hue hai
 56 percent failed in the first year
 aaj vaais chancelar manoj dikshit se jab hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav ne baat kii to ve nahin bataa sake ki kitne chaatr pariksha main baithe the, fail hone vaale chaatro kii kul sankhya kitni he
 The Vice Chancellor divided the results of the government-aided and self-funded college to show a lower Fail figure
 ve yah bhul gaye ki vaais chancelar sarkari madad praapt collejon ke bhi hai or swavitt poshit collejon ke bhi
 Should such a large number of students fail in the name of alleged copying in a university, is this not a comment on the quality of the university
 vahaan kya padhai hoti he ki nakal rokane par fail ho jate hai
 Today when Pramod spoke to VC Manoj Dixit, he did not tell how many students had taken the exam, while in the press conference around 22 February itself, he said that more than 6 lakh students had taken the exam
 chah lakh chaatr pariksha main baithenge to rigelt chah lakh kaa nikalegaa yaa teen lakh kaa nikalegaa? visi dikshit ne pramod se pehle kaha ki nahin maaloom kitne chaatr pariksha main baithe the, aapako omprakash bataa denge
 Later, Pramod Shrivastava tried to know that it was found that he is not an officer of Om Prakash University, he is not in any position
 kaary parishad ke sadsy hai
 As a matter of fact, the VC should have told in the press release of June 19 when he released after our series and showed the percentage of students failing in government and private colleges, why did not he say that more than 3 lakh students exam Did not come only because anti-copying campaign was going on
 22 farvari ko visi ne kaha tha ki snaatak kii pariksha main 6,11680 chaatr shaamil honge
 Result of 3,41000 students came out and 15-16 percent of it failed
 is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya hoti he 54,560
 When VC was asked if more than 6 lakh students gave Imtehan, they said that the remaining students did not come
 is hisaab se 2,70680 chaatr pariksha dene nahin aae, ye to fail se bhi sharmnaak he
 Now add the number of people who failed and did not take the exam
 yah sankhya hoti 3, 25,240 chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 Isn't it embarrassing for a university that half of the students who fill the form either fail to muster the courage to take the exam and fail
 vaise rajyapal ramnike ko check karnaa chahie ki vaaki 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 se adhik chaatro ne pariksha chhod di, or chhod di to yah baat rigelt ke samay kyon nahin website par bataai gai
 Till date it is not mentioned
 19 june kii press relies main visi dikshit bataa sakate the ki kareeb paune teen lakh chaatro ne pariksha hi nahin di
 The comments avadh uniwarsity ke kai collejon main chaatro kii sankhya ke anupaat main shikshak nahin hai
 There are also no teachers according to the number of posts sanctioned
 agar yahi quality shiksha kii rahegi to in uniwarsity ko band kar dena chahie kyonki whants ap uniwarsity to chal hi rahi he
 The results of Kanpur University and Bundelkhand University are also in bad shape
 yaha sirf bie biessi or bikom main 2 lakh 18 hazaar 28 chaatro ne pariksha di thi, isamen se 1 lakh 22 hazaar 583 chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 About 50 percent of the students have failed in Bundelkhand
 sara shrey nakal rokane ko lekar he magar uniwarsity main padhai kii gunvattta kab sudharegi
 Is it good that a university has only 40 percent students
 biessi part van main to 12
 Only 5 percent of the students have passed and the rest have failed
 koi 26000 chaatr fail hai
 Around 24000 students have failed in BSC Part Two
 yah pataa nahin ki biessi main hi 50,000 se adhik chaatr fail hai
 In all courses in Bandelkhand University, 2 lakh 43 thousand students had taken the exam, out of which only 95,445 students have passed
 baaki sab fail
 This is the condition of our higher education
 na teacher hai na principal hai na chaatr paas hone laayak hai
 You can understand what the result will be
 yah raajnneetik swaittata kaa namoona he jo kisi bhi swytta se upar hameshaa hi rahegi
 Now we show you a video from Aligarh
 shivdaan singh inter college ke ek dalit adhyaaapak ne akhbaar kii kating fasebuk par post kar di
 The matter reached the police station
 vahaan par bijepi ke padaadhikari kii maujuudagi main unase maafee mangvayi gai, yahi nahin unase paanv chune ke liye majaboor kiya gaya
 First you watch the video and then tell the details further
 kya police thane main bhi insaaf ab is tarah se hoga ki police adhikari kii maujuudagi main ek adhyaaapak ko paanv chhukar maafee maangani hogi
 When the complaint reached the police station, it was to be done according to the law but they were forced to touch the feet and those who have been asked to touch their feet are the BJP President Kalicharan Gaur
 unka is college se koi lenaa dena nahin hai
 Does this autonomy come from political power or is it with the UGC? angrezi padhaane vaale satyabhan singh ne ek akhbaar kii kating post kii jiskaa sheershak he ki yadi bharat ke bhavishya kaa nirmaan karnaa he to brahmanwad ko pairon tale kuchal daalo
 This statement has been told in the newspaper by Swami Vivekananda
 ise share karne kaa aparaadh itnaa bada he ki satyabhan ko dilit karne ke liye majaboor kiya gaya, fasebuk par maafee maangane kii baat kahi gai, usase bhi santushti nahin hui to satyabhan se kaha gaya ki ve pair chhu kar maafee maange
 However, Swami Vivekananda did not say in his speech in Chicago that crush Brahminism under foot
 hamane bhaashan check kiya he
 Was there no caste arrogance in what happened to teacher Satyabhan Singh, who posted a cut of criticism, asked for forgiveness and was asked to touch his feet in the police station
 kisi ko das logon ke bich paanv chune ke liye majaboor karnaa samantvaadi or jativaadee vyavastha nahin he to or kya he
 When the matter had reached the police station, then it would have been left to the law, why was it forced to touch the feet in a casteist and feudal manner

 You have been given only 10 days to give public opinion for such a big change, which you have to email
 sarkaar ne apni manshaa ke bare main likhaa he vah yah act isliye pesh kar rahi he kyonki vah shiksha ke niamak sansthaaon main sudhaar ke liye patibaddh he taaki ucch shiksha sansthaanon ko zyada swaittata mil sake
 The idea of autonomy is whether private and whether government, neither a professor dares to question nor a vice chancellor
 raajnneetik hastkshep is kadar badhata ja rahaa he ki ab mantri tay karte hai ki skool main kya padhaayaa jayega or college main kya padhaayaa jayega
 However, this act is in front of you
 kya inhen sab uddeshyon ke liye ujisi kaa gathan nahin hua tha, nae ucch shiksha ayog ke makasad main aisa kya khaas he jo ujisi main nahin tha yaa ujisi se puraa nahin ho saktaa tha
 Before you believe that India's problems of higher education have become huge, because the UGC needs to be abolished and a new Higher Education Commission should be understood, that the Higher Education Commission will also face the same problems that the UGC will face Are in front

 You have been given only 10 days to give public opinion for such a big change, which you have to email
 sarkaar ne apni manshaa ke bare main likhaa he vah yah act isliye pesh kar rahi he kyonki vah shiksha ke niamak sansthaaon main sudhaar ke liye patibaddh he taaki ucch shiksha sansthaanon ko zyada swaittata mil sake

 Before you believe that India's problems of higher education have become huge, because the UGC needs to be abolished and a new Higher Education Commission should be understood, that the Higher Education Commission will also face the same problems that the UGC will face Are in front
 2014 ke pehle ke kai saal or uske baad ke chaar saal se in samasyaon ke sangrah kaa nateeja yah he ki aaj saare bharat ke noujvaan 12veen paas karne ke baad dilli uniwarsity kii taraf bhaagate hai
 There is a shortage of one lakh teachers in India
 sarkarein ucch shiksha ke saath kis tarah khilwaad karti hai uskaa ek rup aapako dikhaata hum
 The notification you are seeing is from Jharkhand Central University
 25 june ko isaki website par aplod hota he ki jharkhand central uniwarsity asthaayee rup se 64 sahaayak prophessoron ko behaal karnaa chaahati he
 All these will be given a salary of 55000 months in lump sum
 naukari asthaayee hogi
 But within 12 hours of this notification, there is an improvement that now they will get salary of 35000, not 55000
 yah bhi central uniwarsity he
 When we compared the salary of the temporary teachers in Delhi University, the adhoc teachers there get around 65000 salary
 ek hi bharat sarkaar kii ek uniwarsity kisi ko 35000 detii he or kisi ko 65000
 In Madhya Pradesh, teachers in universities and colleges are teaching at a salary of around 20,000
 agar ye mazaaq nahin to phir mazaaq kya he
 Within 12 hours, the salary in advertising decreases from 55 thousand to 35000
 aapako lagata he ki vaaki acchhee quality ke chaatr apana jivan aisi vyavastha ko denge
 Will give in compulsion but will he have his first election? On 20 August 2017, there is a report of Manas in the Times of India
 jisamen maanav sansaadhan mantri kaa bayaan chapa he ki iaiti, enaiti or universti main ek tihaai pad khaali hai
 So 53 at New Central University
 28 pratishat pad khaali hai
 National Institute of Technology has 47 percent vacancies
 nae or puraani iaiti main 35 pratishat pad khaali hai
 At IIM too, 26 percent of the posts are vacant
 im indore main to 51 pratishat pad khaali hai
 It has been written in 'times of india' kii report main likhaa he ki sarkaar ne sansad ko yah sab jaankaree di he
 You will be aware that more than 70 percent teaching positions are vacant in all the seven AIIMS
 baaki medical collejon ke teaching staff kii list bana rahaa hum, vahaan bhi haalat buree he
 Without a teacher, if you study and become a doctor, there is no need to tell again where this can be amazing
 agast 2017 kii yah report he
 How many posts have been filled at this time, only the HR Minister can tell better
 subah-subah twit kar sakate hai ki central uniwarsity main jo pichley saal tak 6000 se adhik pad khaali the, unamem se kitne par sthaayee niyukti ho chuki he
 i am talking about permanent 20 march 2017 ko maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jawadekar ne kaha tha ki ek saal ke bheetar dilli uniwarsity ke 9000 edock shikshakon ko permanent kar diya gaya
 Is going to be more than a year
 mantriji ko yaad dilaa rahaa hum ki is bare main bhi kal twit kar sakate hai ki 9000 main se kitne edock ko permanent kar chuke hai
 We know it is better to tell right there
 vaise 'times of india' ke mutabik ek april 2017 tak central uniwarsity haryana main 75 fisadi khaali hai
 54 in Delhi University
 75 pratishat pad khaali hai
 Allahabad University has 64 percent vacancies
 bharat main hi 75 pratishat shikshakon ke bina central uniwarsity of haryana chal sakati he yahi jaanane ke liye medhaavi chaatro ko oxfort chhodkar yahaan padhane aana chahie
 You should also enroll your children where there are no teachers
 vaise jahaan bhi karaayenge vahaan shikshak nahin hi honge jo haal he
 By the way, let us tell you that Central University is also considered as autonomous institutions, but every day you see government and political interference there
 hamane aapako pichley dinon bataaya tha ki raamamanohar lohia avadh uniwarsity main biessi third year ke 80 pratishath chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 56 percent of b
sc first year students have failed
 sthaneey media main chapa tha ki avadh uniwarsity main 80 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye
 According to this, when six lakh students took the exam, then there were four lakh 80 thousand
 vishvavidhyalay ke vaais chancelar ne ise hi mudda bana liya ki jab teen lakh se kuch zyada chaatro ke riselt hi nikle hai to 4 lakh 80 hazaar fail ho gaye
 This was a mistake, but we also said that 80 percent of the BSC third year have failed
 first year main 56 pratishat fail hue hai
 Today when our colleague Pramod Srivastava spoke to Vice Chancellor Manoj Dixit, he could not tell how many students appeared in the exam, the total number of students who failed
 vaais chancelar ne fail ke aankade kam dikhaane ke liye sarkari madad praapt or swavitt poshit college ke nateezon main bantwaaraa kar diya
 They have forgotten that the Vice Chancellors are from government aided colleges as well as self-funded colleges
 ek uniwarsity main kathith rup se nakal rokane ke naam par itani badi sankhya main chaatr fail ho jaae kya yah vishwa vidhyalay kii gunvattta par tippanee nahin he
 What is studied there that fails to stop copying? aaj jab pramod ne visi manoj dikshit se baat kii tab unhone nahin bataaya ki kitne chaatro ne pariksha di thi jabaki 22 farvari ke aas paas press conference main khud kaha tha ki 6 lakh se adhik chaatro ne pariksha di thi
 If six lakh students sit for the exam, will the result be six lakhs or three lakhs? VC Dixit said before Pramod that he did not know how many students sat in the examination, Omprakash will tell you
 baad main pramod shrivastav ne jaanane kii koshish ki to yah pataa chalaa ki ye om prakaash uniwarsity ke koi adhikari nahi hai, kisi pad par nahin hai
 Member of Council for Work
 kaayade se visi ko 19 june ke press relies main hi bataanaa chahie tha jab unhone hamaari siries ke baad jari kiya tha or jisamen sarkari or privet collejon main fail hone vaale chaatro kaa pratishat dikhaaya tha, usamen kyon nahin kaha ki 3 lakh se adhik chaatr pariksha hi nahin dene aae kyonki nakal virdohi abhiyaan chal rahaa tha
 On 22 February, VC said that 6,11680 students would be included in the graduation exam
 3,41000 chaatro kaa rigelt niklaa or isamen se 15-16 pratishat fail ho gaye
 Accordingly, the number of students failing is 54,560
 jab visi se poocha gaya ki imtehaan to 6 lakh se adhik chaatro ne diya to unhone kaha ki baaki chaatr nahin aae
 Accordingly, 2,70680 students did not come to take the exam, it is shameful even to fail
 ab aap fail hone vaale or pariksha nahin dene waalon kii sankhya jodie
 This number is 3, 25,240 students are not eligible to pass
 kya yah kisi uniwarsity ke liye sharmnaak nahin he ki form bharne vaale chaatro main se aadhe yaa to imtahaan dene kaa saahas na juta saken or fail ho jaaen
 By the way, Governor Ramnaik should check that indeed more than 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 students left the examination, and left, then why was it not stated on the website at the time of the result
 aaj tak iskaa zikr nahin he
 In the press release of June 19, VC Dixit could tell that about one-third of the three lakh students did not take the exam
 tippaniyan Many colleges in Avadh University do not have teachers in proportion to the number of students
 manzur padon kii sankhya ke hisaab se bhi shikshak nahin hai
 If this quality education remains, then these universities should be closed because what is app university is going on
 kanpur uniwarsity or bundelkhand uniwarsity ke nateezon kaa bhi bura haal he
 Only 2 lakh 18 thousand 28 students took the exam in BA b
sc and b
com here, out of which 1 lakh 22 thousand 583 students have failed
 kareeb kareeb 50 fisadi chaatr bundelkhand main fail hai
 All the credit is about stopping copying, but when will the quality of studies in the university improve
 kya yah acchhee baat he ki ek uniwarsity main sirf 40 pratishat chaatr paas hon
 So 12 in BSC Part One
 5 pratishat chaatr hi paas hue hai baaki sab fail hai
 Some 26000 students have failed
 biessi part tu main bhi 24000 ke kareeb chaatr fail hai
 It is not known that more than 50,000 students have failed in BSC itself
 bandelkhand uniwarsity main sabhi course main kul milakar 2 lakh 43 hazaar chaatro ne pariksha di thi, jisamen se 95,445 chaatr hi paas hue he
 Everyone else failed
 ye he hamaari ucch shiksha kaa haal
 There are neither teachers nor principals nor students are eligible to pass
 nateeja kya hoga aap samaj sakate hai

 In the morning, one can tweet that till last year, more than 6000 posts were vacant in Central University, how many of them have got permanent appointment
 permanent kii baat kar rahaa hum
 On 20 March 2017, Human Resource Minister Prakash Javadekar had said that 9000 adhoc teachers of Delhi University were permanent within a year
 ek saal se zyaada hone ja rahaa he
 Reminding the Minister that i can also tweet tomorrow about how many of the 9000 have admanked
 hamen to pataa he behatar he vahiin bataa den
 According to 'times of India', as of April 1, 2017, Central University Haryana has 75 percent vacancies
 dilli uniwarsity main 54
 75 percent posts are vacant
 elahabaad uniwarsity main 64 fisadi pad khaali hai
 In India itself, meritorious students should leave Oxfort and study here to know that Central University of Haryana can run without 75 percent teachers
 aap bhi apane bacchon kaa namakan vahiin karaaen jahaan shikshak nahin hai
 By the way, wherever you do, there will be no teachers, which is the condition
 vaise aapako bataa den ki central uniwarsity bhi swytt sansthaaen maani jaati hai, magar aae din aap vahaan sarkari or raajnneetik hastkshep dekhte rahete hai
 We told you recently that 80 percent of BSC third year students have failed at Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University
 biessi pratham varsh ke 56 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 It was published in the local media that 80 percent of the students at Awadh University failed
 is hisaab se jab chah lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi to chaar lakh 80 hazaar hue
 The Vice Chancellor of the University made it a point that when the results of more than three lakh students have come out, then 4 lakh 80 thousand have failed
 ye chook thi magar hamane ye bhi kaha tha ki biessi third year main 80 pratishat fail hue hai
 56 percent failed in the first year
 aaj vaais chancelar manoj dikshit se jab hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav ne baat kii to ve nahin bataa sake ki kitne chaatr pariksha main baithe the, fail hone vaale chaatro kii kul sankhya kitni he
 The Vice Chancellor divided the results of the government-aided and self-funded college to show a lower Fail figure
 ve yah bhul gaye ki vaais chancelar sarkari madad praapt collejon ke bhi hai or swavitt poshit collejon ke bhi
 Should such a large number of students fail in the name of alleged copying in a university, is this not a comment on the quality of the university
 vahaan kya padhai hoti he ki nakal rokane par fail ho jate hai
 Today when Pramod spoke to VC Manoj Dixit, he did not tell how many students had taken the exam, while in the press conference around 22 February itself, he said that more than 6 lakh students had taken the exam
 chah lakh chaatr pariksha main baithenge to rigelt chah lakh kaa nikalegaa yaa teen lakh kaa nikalegaa? visi dikshit ne pramod se pehle kaha ki nahin maaloom kitne chaatr pariksha main baithe the, aapako omprakash bataa denge
 Later, Pramod Shrivastava tried to know that it was found that he is not an officer of Om Prakash University, he is not in any position
 kaary parishad ke sadsy hai
 As a matter of fact, the VC should have told in the press release of June 19 when he released after our series and showed the percentage of students failing in government and private colleges, why did not he say that more than 3 lakh students exam Did not come only because anti-copying campaign was going on
 22 farvari ko visi ne kaha tha ki snaatak kii pariksha main 6,11680 chaatr shaamil honge
 Result of 3,41000 students came out and 15-16 percent of it failed
 is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya hoti he 54,560
 When VC was asked if more than 6 lakh students gave Imtehan, they said that the remaining students did not come
 is hisaab se 2,70680 chaatr pariksha dene nahin aae, ye to fail se bhi sharmnaak he
 Now add the number of people who failed and did not take the exam
 yah sankhya hoti 3, 25,240 chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 Isn't it embarrassing for a university that half of the students who fill the form either fail to muster the courage to take the exam and fail
 vaise rajyapal ramnike ko check karnaa chahie ki vaaki 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 se adhik chaatro ne pariksha chhod di, or chhod di to yah baat rigelt ke samay kyon nahin website par bataai gai
 Till date it is not mentioned
 19 june kii press relies main visi dikshit bataa sakate the ki kareeb paune teen lakh chaatro ne pariksha hi nahin di
 The comments avadh uniwarsity ke kai collejon main chaatro kii sankhya ke anupaat main shikshak nahin hai
 There are also no teachers according to the number of posts sanctioned
 agar yahi quality shiksha kii rahegi to in uniwarsity ko band kar dena chahie kyonki whants ap uniwarsity to chal hi rahi he
 The results of Kanpur University and Bundelkhand University are also in bad shape
 yaha sirf bie biessi or bikom main 2 lakh 18 hazaar 28 chaatro ne pariksha di thi, isamen se 1 lakh 22 hazaar 583 chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 About 50 percent of the students have failed in Bundelkhand
 sara shrey nakal rokane ko lekar he magar uniwarsity main padhai kii gunvattta kab sudharegi
 Is it good that a university has only 40 percent students
 biessi part van main to 12
 Only 5 percent of the students have passed and the rest have failed
 koi 26000 chaatr fail hai
 Around 24000 students have failed in BSC Part Two
 yah pataa nahin ki biessi main hi 50,000 se adhik chaatr fail hai
 In all courses in Bandelkhand University, 2 lakh 43 thousand students had taken the exam, out of which only 95,445 students have passed
 baaki sab fail
 This is the condition of our higher education
 na teacher hai na principal hai na chaatr paas hone laayak hai

 Result of 3,41000 students came out and 15-16 percent of it failed
 is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya hoti he 54,560
 When VC was asked if more than 6 lakh students gave Imtehan, they said that the remaining students did not come
 is hisaab se 2,70680 chaatr pariksha dene nahin aae, ye to fail se bhi sharmnaak he
 Now add the number of people who failed and did not take the exam
 yah sankhya hoti 3, 25,240 chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 Isn't it embarrassing for a university that half of the students who fill the form either fail to muster the courage to take the exam and fail
 vaise rajyapal ramnike ko check karnaa chahie ki vaaki 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 se adhik chaatro ne pariksha chhod di, or chhod di to yah baat rigelt ke samay kyon nahin website par bataai gai
 Till date it is not mentioned
 19 june kii press relies main visi dikshit bataa sakate the ki kareeb paune teen lakh chaatro ne pariksha hi nahin di
 The comments avadh uniwarsity ke kai collejon main chaatro kii sankhya ke anupaat main shikshak nahin hai
 There are also no teachers according to the number of posts sanctioned
 agar yahi quality shiksha kii rahegi to in uniwarsity ko band kar dena chahie kyonki whants ap uniwarsity to chal hi rahi he
 The results of Kanpur University and Bundelkhand University are also in bad shape
 yaha sirf bie biessi or bikom main 2 lakh 18 hazaar 28 chaatro ne pariksha di thi, isamen se 1 lakh 22 hazaar 583 chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 About 50 percent of the students have failed in Bundelkhand
 sara shrey nakal rokane ko lekar he magar uniwarsity main padhai kii gunvattta kab sudharegi
 Is it good that a university has only 40 percent students
 biessi part van main to 12
 Only 5 percent of the students have passed and the rest have failed
 koi 26000 chaatr fail hai
 Around 24000 students have failed in BSC Part Two
 yah pataa nahin ki biessi main hi 50,000 se adhik chaatr fail hai
 In all courses in Bandelkhand University, 2 lakh 43 thousand students had taken the exam, out of which only 95,445 students have passed
 baaki sab fail
 This is the condition of our higher education
 na teacher hai na principal hai na chaatr paas hone laayak hai
 You can understand what the result will be
 sarkaar ne apni manshaa ke bare main likhaa he vah yah act isliye pesh kar rahi he kyonki vah shiksha ke niamak sansthaaon main sudhaar ke liye patibaddh he taaki ucch shiksha sansthaanon ko zyada swaittata mil sake
 The idea of autonomy is whether private and whether government, neither a professor dares to question nor a vice chancellor
 raajnneetik hastkshep is kadar badhata ja rahaa he ki ab mantri tay karte hai ki skool main kya padhaayaa jayega or college main kya padhaayaa jayega
 However, this act is in front of you
 kya inhen sab uddeshyon ke liye ujisi kaa gathan nahin hua tha, nae ucch shiksha ayog ke makasad main aisa kya khaas he jo ujisi main nahin tha yaa ujisi se puraa nahin ho saktaa tha
 Before you believe that India's problems of higher education have become huge, because the UGC needs to be abolished and a new Higher Education Commission should be understood, that the Higher Education Commission will also face the same problems that the UGC will face Are in front
 2014 ke pehle ke kai saal or uske baad ke chaar saal se in samasyaon ke sangrah kaa nateeja yah he ki aaj saare bharat ke noujvaan 12veen paas karne ke baad dilli uniwarsity kii taraf bhaagate hai
 There is a shortage of one lakh teachers in India
 sarkarein ucch shiksha ke saath kis tarah khilwaad karti hai uskaa ek rup aapako dikhaata hum
 The notification you are seeing is from Jharkhand Central University
 25 june ko isaki website par aplod hota he ki jharkhand central uniwarsity asthaayee rup se 64 sahaayak prophessoron ko behaal karnaa chaahati he
 All these will be given a salary of 55000 months in lump sum
 naukari asthaayee hogi
 But within 12 hours of this notification, there is an improvement that now they will get salary of 35000, not 55000
 yah bhi central uniwarsity he
 When we compared the salary of the temporary teachers in Delhi University, the adhoc teachers there get around 65000 salary
 ek hi bharat sarkaar kii ek uniwarsity kisi ko 35000 detii he or kisi ko 65000
 In Madhya Pradesh, teachers in universities and colleges are teaching at a salary of around 20,000
 agar ye mazaaq nahin to phir mazaaq kya he
 Within 12 hours, the salary in advertising decreases from 55 thousand to 35000
 aapako lagata he ki vaaki acchhee quality ke chaatr apana jivan aisi vyavastha ko denge
 Will give in compulsion but will he have his first election? On 20 August 2017, there is a report of Manas in the Times of India
 jisamen maanav sansaadhan mantri kaa bayaan chapa he ki iaiti, enaiti or universti main ek tihaai pad khaali hai
 So 53 at New Central University
 28 pratishat pad khaali hai
 National Institute of Technology has 47 percent vacancies
 nae or puraani iaiti main 35 pratishat pad khaali hai
 At IIM too, 26 percent of the posts are vacant
 im indore main to 51 pratishat pad khaali hai
 The Times of India report states that the government has given all this information to the Parliament
 aapako pataa hi hoga ki saaton ames main teaching ke 70 fisadi se adhik pad khaali hai
 i am making a list of teaching staff of other medical colleges, the situation is also bad there
 bina teacher ke aap padhakar doctor ho jaae yah kamaal kahaan ho saktaa he, yah baar-baar bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 This is the report for August 2017
 is vakt kitne pad bhare ja chuke hai maanav sansaadhan mantri hi behatar bataa sakate he
 In the morning, one can tweet that till last year, more than 6000 posts were vacant in Central University, how many of them have got permanent appointment
 permanent kii baat kar rahaa hum
 On 20 March 2017, Human Resource Minister Prakash Javadekar had said that 9000 adhoc teachers of Delhi University were permanent within a year
 ek saal se zyaada hone ja rahaa he
 Reminding the Minister that i can also tweet tomorrow about how many of the 9000 have admanked

 According to 'times of India', as of April 1, 2017, Central University Haryana has 75 percent vacancies
 dilli uniwarsity main 54
 75 percent posts are vacant
 elahabaad uniwarsity main 64 fisadi pad khaali hai
 In India itself, meritorious students should leave Oxfort and study here to know that Central University of Haryana can run without 75 percent teachers
 aap bhi apane bacchon kaa namakan vahiin karaaen jahaan shikshak nahin hai
 By the way, wherever you do, there will be no teachers, which is the condition
 vaise aapako bataa den ki central uniwarsity bhi swytt sansthaaen maani jaati hai, magar aae din aap vahaan sarkari or raajnneetik hastkshep dekhte rahete hai
 We told you recently that 80 percent of BSC third year students have failed at Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University
 biessi pratham varsh ke 56 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 It was published in the local media that 80 percent of the students at Awadh University failed
 is hisaab se jab chah lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi to chaar lakh 80 hazaar hue
 The Vice Chancellor of the University made it a point that when the results of more than three lakh students have come out, then 4 lakh 80 thousand have failed
 ye chook thi magar hamane ye bhi kaha tha ki biessi third year main 80 pratishat fail hue hai
 56 percent failed in the first year
 aaj vaais chancelar manoj dikshit se jab hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav ne baat kii to ve nahin bataa sake ki kitne chaatr pariksha main baithe the, fail hone vaale chaatro kii kul sankhya kitni he
 The Vice Chancellor divided the results of the government-aided and self-funded college to show a lower Fail figure
 ve yah bhul gaye ki vaais chancelar sarkari madad praapt collejon ke bhi hai or swavitt poshit collejon ke bhi
 Should such a large number of students fail in the name of alleged copying in a university, is this not a comment on the quality of the university
 vahaan kya padhai hoti he ki nakal rokane par fail ho jate hai
 Today when Pramod spoke to VC Manoj Dixit, he did not tell how many students had taken the exam, while in the press conference around 22 February itself, he said that more than 6 lakh students had taken the exam
 chah lakh chaatr pariksha main baithenge to rigelt chah lakh kaa nikalegaa yaa teen lakh kaa nikalegaa? visi dikshit ne pramod se pehle kaha ki nahin maaloom kitne chaatr pariksha main baithe the, aapako omprakash bataa denge
 Later, Pramod Shrivastava tried to know that it was found that he is not an officer of Om Prakash University, he is not in any position

 This is the condition of our higher education
 na teacher hai na principal hai na chaatr paas hone laayak hai
 You can understand what the result will be
 ye jo notification aap dekh rahe hai wo jharkhand central uniwarsity kaa he
 On 25 June, it is uploaded on its website that Jharkhand Central University wants to temporarily reinstate 64 assistant professors
 in sabhi ko ekamusth 55000 maheene kii selary di jaaegi
 The job will be temporary
 magar is notification ke 12 ghante ke bheetar ek sudhaar karti he ki ab unhen 55000 nahin, 35000 kii selary milegi
 It is also Central University
 hamane dilli uniwarsity main asthaayee padhaane vaale shikshakon kii selary se tulana kii to vahaan edock padhaane waalon ko 65000 ke kareeb selary milti he
 a university of the same Government of India gives 35000 to someone and 65000 to someone
 madhya pradesh main to uniwarsity or colejo main shikshak 20,000 ke aas paas kii selary par padhaa rahe hai
 If this is not a joke, then what is a joke? 12 ghante ke bheetar vigyaapan main selary 55 hazaar se ghatakar 35000 ho jaati he
 You feel that students of really good quality will give their lives to such a system
 majaburi main de denge lekin kya unka pehla chunaav hoga? 20 agast 2017 ko 'times of india main maanas kii ek report he
 In which the statement of the Minister of Human Resources has been printed that one third of the posts in iits, nits and Universities are vacant
 nai central uniwarsity main to 53
 28 percent of the posts are vacant
 neshnal institute of technolji main 47 pratishat pad khaali hai
 There are 35 percent vacancies in the new and old iits
 im main bhi 26 pratishat pad khaali hai
 At IIM Indore, 51 percent posts are vacant
 'times of india' kii report main likhaa he ki sarkaar ne sansad ko yah sab jaankaree di he
 You will be aware that more than 70 percent teaching positions are vacant in all the seven AIIMS
 baaki medical collejon ke teaching staff kii list bana rahaa hum, vahaan bhi haalat buree he
 Without a teacher, if you study and become a doctor, there is no need to tell again where this can be amazing
 agast 2017 kii yah report he
 How many posts have been filled at this time, only the HR Minister can tell better
 subah-subah twit kar sakate hai ki central uniwarsity main jo pichley saal tak 6000 se adhik pad khaali the, unamem se kitne par sthaayee niyukti ho chuki he
 i am talking about permanent 20 march 2017 ko maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jawadekar ne kaha tha ki ek saal ke bheetar dilli uniwarsity ke 9000 edock shikshakon ko permanent kar diya gaya
 Is going to be more than a year
 mantriji ko yaad dilaa rahaa hum ki is bare main bhi kal twit kar sakate hai ki 9000 main se kitne edock ko permanent kar chuke hai
 We know it is better to tell right there
 vaise 'times of india' ke mutabik ek april 2017 tak central uniwarsity haryana main 75 fisadi khaali hai
 54 in Delhi University
 75 pratishat pad khaali hai
 Allahabad University has 64 percent vacancies
 bharat main hi 75 pratishat shikshakon ke bina central uniwarsity of haryana chal sakati he yahi jaanane ke liye medhaavi chaatro ko oxfort chhodkar yahaan padhane aana chahie
 You should also enroll your children where there are no teachers
 vaise jahaan bhi karaayenge vahaan shikshak nahin hi honge jo haal he
 By the way, let us tell you that Central University is also considered as autonomous institutions, but every day you see government and political interference there
 hamane aapako pichley dinon bataaya tha ki raamamanohar lohia avadh uniwarsity main biessi third year ke 80 pratishath chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 56 percent of b
sc first year students have failed
 sthaneey media main chapa tha ki avadh uniwarsity main 80 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye
 According to this, when six lakh students took the exam, then there were four lakh 80 thousand
 vishvavidhyalay ke vaais chancelar ne ise hi mudda bana liya ki jab teen lakh se kuch zyada chaatro ke riselt hi nikle hai to 4 lakh 80 hazaar fail ho gaye
 This was a mistake, but we also said that 80 percent of the BSC third year have failed
 first year main 56 pratishat fail hue hai
 Today when our colleague Pramod Srivastava spoke to Vice Chancellor Manoj Dixit, he could not tell how many students appeared in the exam, the total number of students who failed
 vaais chancelar ne fail ke aankade kam dikhaane ke liye sarkari madad praapt or swavitt poshit college ke nateezon main bantwaaraa kar diya
 They have forgotten that the Vice Chancellors are from government aided colleges as well as self-funded colleges
 ek uniwarsity main kathith rup se nakal rokane ke naam par itani badi sankhya main chaatr fail ho jaae kya yah vishwa vidhyalay kii gunvattta par tippanee nahin he
 What is studied there that fails to stop copying? aaj jab pramod ne visi manoj dikshit se baat kii tab unhone nahin bataaya ki kitne chaatro ne pariksha di thi jabaki 22 farvari ke aas paas press conference main khud kaha tha ki 6 lakh se adhik chaatro ne pariksha di thi
 If six lakh students sit for the exam, will the result be six lakhs or three lakhs? VC Dixit said before Pramod that he did not know how many students sat in the examination, Omprakash will tell you
 baad main pramod shrivastav ne jaanane kii koshish ki to yah pataa chalaa ki ye om prakaash uniwarsity ke koi adhikari nahi hai, kisi pad par nahin hai
 Member of Council for Work
 kaayade se visi ko 19 june ke press relies main hi bataanaa chahie tha jab unhone hamaari siries ke baad jari kiya tha or jisamen sarkari or privet collejon main fail hone vaale chaatro kaa pratishat dikhaaya tha, usamen kyon nahin kaha ki 3 lakh se adhik chaatr pariksha hi nahin dene aae kyonki nakal virdohi abhiyaan chal rahaa tha
 On 22 February, VC said that 6,11680 students would be included in the graduation exam
 3,41000 chaatro kaa rigelt niklaa or isamen se 15-16 pratishat fail ho gaye
 Accordingly, the number of students failing is 54,560
 jab visi se poocha gaya ki imtehaan to 6 lakh se adhik chaatro ne diya to unhone kaha ki baaki chaatr nahin aae
 Accordingly, 2,70680 students did not come to take the exam, it is shameful even to fail
 ab aap fail hone vaale or pariksha nahin dene waalon kii sankhya jodie
 This number is 3, 25,240 students are not eligible to pass
 kya yah kisi uniwarsity ke liye sharmnaak nahin he ki form bharne vaale chaatro main se aadhe yaa to imtahaan dene kaa saahas na juta saken or fail ho jaaen
 By the way, Governor Ramnaik should check that indeed more than 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 students left the examination, and left, then why was it not stated on the website at the time of the result
 aaj tak iskaa zikr nahin he
 In the press release of June 19, VC Dixit could tell that about one-third of the three lakh students did not take the exam
 tippaniyan Many colleges in Avadh University do not have teachers in proportion to the number of students
 manzur padon kii sankhya ke hisaab se bhi shikshak nahin hai
 If this quality education remains, then these universities should be closed because what is app university is going on
 kanpur uniwarsity or bundelkhand uniwarsity ke nateezon kaa bhi bura haal he
 Only 2 lakh 18 thousand 28 students took the exam in BA b
sc and b
com here, out of which 1 lakh 22 thousand 583 students have failed
 kareeb kareeb 50 fisadi chaatr bundelkhand main fail hai
 All the credit is about stopping copying, but when will the quality of studies in the university improve
 kya yah acchhee baat he ki ek uniwarsity main sirf 40 pratishat chaatr paas hon
 So 12 in BSC Part One
 5 pratishat chaatr hi paas hue hai baaki sab fail hai
 Some 26000 students have failed

 In Madhya Pradesh, teachers in universities and colleges are teaching at a salary of around 20,000
 agar ye mazaaq nahin to phir mazaaq kya he
 Within 12 hours, the salary in advertising decreases from 55 thousand to 35000
 aapako lagata he ki vaaki acchhee quality ke chaatr apana jivan aisi vyavastha ko denge
 Will give in compulsion but will he have his first election? On 20 August 2017, there is a report of Manas in the Times of India

 i am making a list of teaching staff of other medical colleges, the situation is also bad there
 bina teacher ke aap padhakar doctor ho jaae yah kamaal kahaan ho saktaa he, yah baar-baar bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 This is the report for August 2017
 is vakt kitne pad bhare ja chuke hai maanav sansaadhan mantri hi behatar bataa sakate he
 In the morning, one can tweet that till last year, more than 6000 posts were vacant in Central University, how many of them have got permanent appointment
 permanent kii baat kar rahaa hum
 On 20 March 2017, Human Resource Minister Prakash Javadekar had said that 9000 adhoc teachers of Delhi University were permanent within a year
 ek saal se zyaada hone ja rahaa he
 Reminding the Minister that i can also tweet tomorrow about how many of the 9000 have admanked
 hamen to pataa he behatar he vahiin bataa den
 According to 'times of India', as of April 1, 2017, Central University Haryana has 75 percent vacancies
 dilli uniwarsity main 54
 75 percent posts are vacant
 elahabaad uniwarsity main 64 fisadi pad khaali hai
 In India itself, meritorious students should leave Oxfort and study here to know that Central University of Haryana can run without 75 percent teachers
 aap bhi apane bacchon kaa namakan vahiin karaaen jahaan shikshak nahin hai
 By the way, wherever you do, there will be no teachers, which is the condition
 vaise aapako bataa den ki central uniwarsity bhi swytt sansthaaen maani jaati hai, magar aae din aap vahaan sarkari or raajnneetik hastkshep dekhte rahete hai
 We told you recently that 80 percent of BSC third year students have failed at Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University
 biessi pratham varsh ke 56 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 It was published in the local media that 80 percent of the students at Awadh University failed
 is hisaab se jab chah lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi to chaar lakh 80 hazaar hue
 The Vice Chancellor of the University made it a point that when the results of more than three lakh students have come out, then 4 lakh 80 thousand have failed
 ye chook thi magar hamane ye bhi kaha tha ki biessi third year main 80 pratishat fail hue hai
 56 percent failed in the first year
 aaj vaais chancelar manoj dikshit se jab hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav ne baat kii to ve nahin bataa sake ki kitne chaatr pariksha main baithe the, fail hone vaale chaatro kii kul sankhya kitni he
 The Vice Chancellor divided the results of the government-aided and self-funded college to show a lower Fail figure
 ve yah bhul gaye ki vaais chancelar sarkari madad praapt collejon ke bhi hai or swavitt poshit collejon ke bhi
 Should such a large number of students fail in the name of alleged copying in a university, is this not a comment on the quality of the university
 vahaan kya padhai hoti he ki nakal rokane par fail ho jate hai
 Today when Pramod spoke to VC Manoj Dixit, he did not tell how many students had taken the exam, while in the press conference around 22 February itself, he said that more than 6 lakh students had taken the exam
 chah lakh chaatr pariksha main baithenge to rigelt chah lakh kaa nikalegaa yaa teen lakh kaa nikalegaa? visi dikshit ne pramod se pehle kaha ki nahin maaloom kitne chaatr pariksha main baithe the, aapako omprakash bataa denge
 Later, Pramod Shrivastava tried to know that it was found that he is not an officer of Om Prakash University, he is not in any position
 kaary parishad ke sadsy hai
 As a matter of fact, the VC should have told in the press release of June 19 when he released after our series and showed the percentage of students failing in government and private colleges, why did not he say that more than 3 lakh students exam Did not come only because anti-copying campaign was going on
 22 farvari ko visi ne kaha tha ki snaatak kii pariksha main 6,11680 chaatr shaamil honge
 Result of 3,41000 students came out and 15-16 percent of it failed
 is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya hoti he 54,560
 When VC was asked if more than 6 lakh students gave Imtehan, they said that the remaining students did not come
 is hisaab se 2,70680 chaatr pariksha dene nahin aae, ye to fail se bhi sharmnaak he
 Now add the number of people who failed and did not take the exam
 yah sankhya hoti 3, 25,240 chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 Isn't it embarrassing for a university that half of the students who fill the form either fail to muster the courage to take the exam and fail
 vaise rajyapal ramnike ko check karnaa chahie ki vaaki 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 se adhik chaatro ne pariksha chhod di, or chhod di to yah baat rigelt ke samay kyon nahin website par bataai gai
 Till date it is not mentioned
 19 june kii press relies main visi dikshit bataa sakate the ki kareeb paune teen lakh chaatro ne pariksha hi nahin di
 The comments avadh uniwarsity ke kai collejon main chaatro kii sankhya ke anupaat main shikshak nahin hai
 There are also no teachers according to the number of posts sanctioned
 agar yahi quality shiksha kii rahegi to in uniwarsity ko band kar dena chahie kyonki whants ap uniwarsity to chal hi rahi he
 The results of Kanpur University and Bundelkhand University are also in bad shape
 yaha sirf bie biessi or bikom main 2 lakh 18 hazaar 28 chaatro ne pariksha di thi, isamen se 1 lakh 22 hazaar 583 chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 About 50 percent of the students have failed in Bundelkhand
 sara shrey nakal rokane ko lekar he magar uniwarsity main padhai kii gunvattta kab sudharegi
 Is it good that a university has only 40 percent students
 biessi part van main to 12
 Only 5 percent of the students have passed and the rest have failed
 koi 26000 chaatr fail hai
 Around 24000 students have failed in BSC Part Two
 yah pataa nahin ki biessi main hi 50,000 se adhik chaatr fail hai
 In all courses in Bandelkhand University, 2 lakh 43 thousand students had taken the exam, out of which only 95,445 students have passed
 baaki sab fail
 This is the condition of our higher education
 na teacher hai na principal hai na chaatr paas hone laayak hai
 You can understand what the result will be
 nai central uniwarsity main to 53
 28 percent of the posts are vacant
 neshnal institute of technolji main 47 pratishat pad khaali hai
 There are 35 percent vacancies in the new and old iits
 im main bhi 26 pratishat pad khaali hai
 At IIM Indore, 51 percent posts are vacant
 'times of india' kii report main likhaa he ki sarkaar ne sansad ko yah sab jaankaree di he
 You will be aware that more than 70 percent teaching positions are vacant in all the seven AIIMS
 baaki medical collejon ke teaching staff kii list bana rahaa hum, vahaan bhi haalat buree he
 Without a teacher, if you study and become a doctor, there is no need to tell again where this can be amazing
 agast 2017 kii yah report he
 How many posts have been filled at this time, only the HR Minister can tell better
 subah-subah twit kar sakate hai ki central uniwarsity main jo pichley saal tak 6000 se adhik pad khaali the, unamem se kitne par sthaayee niyukti ho chuki he
 i am talking about permanent 20 march 2017 ko maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jawadekar ne kaha tha ki ek saal ke bheetar dilli uniwarsity ke 9000 edock shikshakon ko permanent kar diya gaya
 Is going to be more than a year
 mantriji ko yaad dilaa rahaa hum ki is bare main bhi kal twit kar sakate hai ki 9000 main se kitne edock ko permanent kar chuke hai
 We know it is better to tell right there
 vaise 'times of india' ke mutabik ek april 2017 tak central uniwarsity haryana main 75 fisadi khaali hai
 54 in Delhi University
 75 pratishat pad khaali hai
 Allahabad University has 64 percent vacancies
 bharat main hi 75 pratishat shikshakon ke bina central uniwarsity of haryana chal sakati he yahi jaanane ke liye medhaavi chaatro ko oxfort chhodkar yahaan padhane aana chahie
 You should also enroll your children where there are no teachers
 vaise jahaan bhi karaayenge vahaan shikshak nahin hi honge jo haal he
 By the way, let us tell you that Central University is also considered as autonomous institutions, but every day you see government and political interference there
 hamane aapako pichley dinon bataaya tha ki raamamanohar lohia avadh uniwarsity main biessi third year ke 80 pratishath chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 56 percent of b
sc first year students have failed
 sthaneey media main chapa tha ki avadh uniwarsity main 80 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye
 According to this, when six lakh students took the exam, then there were four lakh 80 thousand
 vishvavidhyalay ke vaais chancelar ne ise hi mudda bana liya ki jab teen lakh se kuch zyada chaatro ke riselt hi nikle hai to 4 lakh 80 hazaar fail ho gaye
 This was a mistake, but we also said that 80 percent of the BSC third year have failed
 first year main 56 pratishat fail hue hai
 Today when our colleague Pramod Srivastava spoke to Vice Chancellor Manoj Dixit, he could not tell how many students appeared in the exam, the total number of students who failed
 vaais chancelar ne fail ke aankade kam dikhaane ke liye sarkari madad praapt or swavitt poshit college ke nateezon main bantwaaraa kar diya
 They have forgotten that the Vice Chancellors are from government aided colleges as well as self-funded colleges
 ek uniwarsity main kathith rup se nakal rokane ke naam par itani badi sankhya main chaatr fail ho jaae kya yah vishwa vidhyalay kii gunvattta par tippanee nahin he
 What is studied there that fails to stop copying? aaj jab pramod ne visi manoj dikshit se baat kii tab unhone nahin bataaya ki kitne chaatro ne pariksha di thi jabaki 22 farvari ke aas paas press conference main khud kaha tha ki 6 lakh se adhik chaatro ne pariksha di thi
 If six lakh students sit for the exam, will the result be six lakhs or three lakhs? VC Dixit said before Pramod that he did not know how many students sat in the examination, Omprakash will tell you
 baad main pramod shrivastav ne jaanane kii koshish ki to yah pataa chalaa ki ye om prakaash uniwarsity ke koi adhikari nahi hai, kisi pad par nahin hai
 Member of Council for Work
 kaayade se visi ko 19 june ke press relies main hi bataanaa chahie tha jab unhone hamaari siries ke baad jari kiya tha or jisamen sarkari or privet collejon main fail hone vaale chaatro kaa pratishat dikhaaya tha, usamen kyon nahin kaha ki 3 lakh se adhik chaatr pariksha hi nahin dene aae kyonki nakal virdohi abhiyaan chal rahaa tha
 On 22 February, VC said that 6,11680 students would be included in the graduation exam
 3,41000 chaatro kaa rigelt niklaa or isamen se 15-16 pratishat fail ho gaye
 Accordingly, the number of students failing is 54,560
 jab visi se poocha gaya ki imtehaan to 6 lakh se adhik chaatro ne diya to unhone kaha ki baaki chaatr nahin aae
 Accordingly, 2,70680 students did not come to take the exam, it is shameful even to fail
 ab aap fail hone vaale or pariksha nahin dene waalon kii sankhya jodie
 This number is 3, 25,240 students are not eligible to pass
 kya yah kisi uniwarsity ke liye sharmnaak nahin he ki form bharne vaale chaatro main se aadhe yaa to imtahaan dene kaa saahas na juta saken or fail ho jaaen
 By the way, Governor Ramnaik should check that indeed more than 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 students left the examination, and left, then why was it not stated on the website at the time of the result
 aaj tak iskaa zikr nahin he
 In the press release of June 19, VC Dixit could tell that about one-third of the three lakh students did not take the exam
 tippaniyan Many colleges in Avadh University do not have teachers in proportion to the number of students
 manzur padon kii sankhya ke hisaab se bhi shikshak nahin hai
 If this quality education remains, then these universities should be closed because what is app university is going on
 kanpur uniwarsity or bundelkhand uniwarsity ke nateezon kaa bhi bura haal he
 Only 2 lakh 18 thousand 28 students took the exam in BA b
sc and b
com here, out of which 1 lakh 22 thousand 583 students have failed
 kareeb kareeb 50 fisadi chaatr bundelkhand main fail hai
 All the credit is about stopping copying, but when will the quality of studies in the university improve
 kya yah acchhee baat he ki ek uniwarsity main sirf 40 pratishat chaatr paas hon
 So 12 in BSC Part One
 5 pratishat chaatr hi paas hue hai baaki sab fail hai
 Some 26000 students have failed
 biessi part tu main bhi 24000 ke kareeb chaatr fail hai
 It is not known that more than 50,000 students have failed in BSC itself
 bandelkhand uniwarsity main sabhi course main kul milakar 2 lakh 43 hazaar chaatro ne pariksha di thi, jisamen se 95,445 chaatr hi paas hue he
