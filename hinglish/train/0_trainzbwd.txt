 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said on Sunday that he had no information about the release of the three policemen abducted by the Maoists at Lakhisarai on August 29
 nitish ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki mujhe bandhakon ke :maovadiyon dwaara: reeha kiye jane ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin he
 It was claimed on behalf of the Maoists that they have freed the hostages, after which the Chief Minister's statement came
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle maovadiyon ne ek hawaldaar kii hatya karne kaa daawa kiya tha, jiskaa shav baad main mila
 According to a view broadcast on a local TV channel, the Maoist leader, who described himself as 'kishenji', met the family of abducted policeman Abhay Prasad Yadav early Sunday and claimed that he would be released soon
 mukhyamantri ne shanivaar ko kaha tha ki sarvadaleey baithak main maovadiyon se bina shart bandhakon ko reeha karne tathaa baatcheet ke liye unke pratinidhi ko surakshit maarg kaa prastaav dene kii sahmati bani he
 If 78 overs are left and there are only 4 runs to make, then you must be sure that the team's victory

 pakistan ke gharelu cricket kaayad i ajam toornament ke ek match main water and power development othority (WAPDA) kaa muqabla peshawar se tha
 WAPDA had to score 4 runs in 78 overs to win the last day

 In such a situation, he dismissed Irfan through mancaping
 aise main ampire ke paas koi chaara nahin tha out dene ke sivaae
 Once even asked the fielding team to reconsider their decision
 haalanki WAPDA kii team ne apana faisla nahin badla
 Due to this, WAPDA lost by three runs to Peshawar

 Sportsmanship should be the most important, but the match did not end correctly

 There is a very old demand of this middle class that tax exemption should be increased
 khud pradhanmantri iskaa zikr kar chuke hai
 Now their expectations from the election budget are sky high
 jab bhi bajet aata he madhya varg kii aakhen chamakane lagati hai

 At a rally in Kolkata on Sunday, BJP national president Amit Shah made many allegations against Mamata Banerjee
 main unke bhaashan ke us hisse ko likhakar laayaa hum jiskaa sandarbh aaj ke vivaad se he
 This is part of Amit Shah's statement
 kuch vaakya nahin hai, lekin shabdash: he, amit shah kehete hai ki mamata di ne bardhaman ke andar jo bam blast hue uske aropiyon ko bachaana shuru kiya
 i want to tell you that the person who was killed in the bomb blast on October 2, Shakeel Ahmed was also trapped in the bomb blast earlier
 bengal police ne unako kyon nahin pakadaa
 Who was Nurul Hasan Chaudhary, whose bomb blast took place inside his house
 enie ko jaanch dene ke virodh main mamata di ne statement die the
 Who do you want to save? bangladeshi ghuspaithiyon ke aadhaar par aap bangladesh par shashan nahin kar sakati mamata di
 Bangladeshi infiltrators are infiltrators, did not make you the Chief Minister of Bangladesh
 agar aap bangladesh ke ghuspaithiyon ke aadhaar par hi trinmul ko bachaana chaahati hai to mujhe kehane main koi sankoch nahin he mamata di ki aapaki ulti ginati shuru ho gai he
 RDX is caught inside Bardhaman
 enie ko kaam karne nahin diya ja rahaa he
 How many TMC leaders are associated with this blast, friends
 or bardhaman ke peeche jo log lage hai, unako paise kisne die uski jaanch shuru hui to aap logon ko sunakar aashcharya hoga ki uske peeche bhi ye sharada scam ke paise is bam blast ke peeche upyog hue hai
 And both these investigations are clubbing at a turning point
 sibiai is maamle kii bhi jaanch kar rahi he
 According to this statement, Amit Shah has made these allegations based on the investigation of two agencies
 ab ye sawaal sarkaar se trinmul congress ke saansadon ko poochna chahie tha, lekin puch diya bijepi ke hi do saansadon ne
 Hari Manjhi, MP from Gaya in Bihar and Prahlad Joshi, MP from Dharwad, Karnataka
 inhen ke sawaal ke jawaab main pradhanmantri karyaalay main rajyamantri jitendra singh ne likhit jawaab diya he
 The question was- In the investigation that has taken place in the Saradha chit fund scam, has the CBI found anything that suggests that its money has been given for terrorist activities in Bangladesh
 jitendra singh− jaanch se abhi tak aise kisi len−dein kaa pataa nahin chalaa he ki aatankwaadi kaarywahiyon kii madad ke liye bangladesh paise bheje gaye the
 What the government says to the MP of its party, will it not say that to the party's national president
 yahi ki jaanch jari he or abhi tak iske pramaan nahin mili hai ki aatanki gatividhiyon main trinmul ke netaaon ne sharada chit fund kaa paisa lagaaya he
 It is evident that the Trinamool Congress is very angry, its mps likewise come to Parliament with a black umbrella, sometimes a black shawl, sometimes a red diary
 vaise trinmul congress ne bhi bina jaanch ke kuch na kuch aarope to lagaae hi honge
 Say anything among the public
 satta mil jaaegi phir bole hue kaa koi hisaab nahin
 The one who will not get power will get the U-turn book printed
 vaise trinmul congress amit shah se sirf maafee kii hi maang kar rahi he
 In February 2013, the year when Sushil Shinde spoke of saffron terror, the entire BJP was enraged
 sonia gandhi or manmohan singh se maafee mangavane kii maang karne lagi
 Sushil Shinde as the Home Minister had to regret it
 2010 main jab chidambaram ne hindu aatankwaad kii baat kii thi to bijepi ne sansad nahin chalane di thi
 Is it written in the law that before the investigation is complete, you can make allegations, but you cannot give a clean chit
 jaanch puri bhi ho jaae to clin chit jaanch agency degi yaa adaalat
 Then shouldn't Amit Shah tell who told him that the money was used in terrorist proceedings
 kul milakar chit−fund main ghotaalaa kii jaanch se pehle hi clin chit main ghotaalaa ho gaya he
 a political party should be accused of supporting terrorist activities on some basis or the like

 There are madrasas in Bengal, Bihar, UP and Kerala which are regulated
 manyata praapt hai
 It was revealed in the Bardhaman blast that a person from Bangladesh was running a madrasa and giving jihadi training to the girls
 khufia agenciyon ke sutron ne express kii reporter ko bataaya he ki abhi tak aisa kuch nahin mila he
 But, on 31 October, India Today reported that the National Investigation Agency NIA had found 58 terrorist modules in illegal madrasas bordering Bangladesh
 khufia agenciyon kii report ke aadhaar par 2011 main bengal bijepi ke adhyaksh rahul sinha ne kaha tha ki seemaa se lage zyaadaatar madrason main bharat virdohi gatividhiyon chal rahi hai
 This news appeared in the Hindu newspaper of 12 June 2011
 tab bijepi ne bengal main 1 xxrep 4 0 madrason ko manyata dene ke mamata banerjee ke faislon kaa virodh karte hue kaha tha ki mamata banerjee rashtriya ekta se khilwaad kar rahi hai
 Mamta had said that only recognition has been given, not financial help
 kendriya mantri jitendra singh ke bayaan ke baad kya ab bhi amit shah apana bachaav kar sakate hai

 Earlier, a judge bench rejected the company's claim of exclusive right to the word Krishna for dairy products against which the company appealed
 peeth ne kaha, sabhi jaanate hai ki bhagwaan krishna ko bachapan main unke doodh or makkhan prem ke liye janaa jaataa he or isliye bhagwaan krishna doodh or makkhan se gahare jude hai or isse apane deyari utpaadon ke saath krishna naam jodne kaa vishisht daawa nishchit taur par kamjor pad jaataa he
 Earlier, a single judge bench had dismissed the petition to stop the city's Parul Food Specialties from adding Krishna's name to its milk products
 peeth ne kaha tha ki kai deyari companiyon ne apane utpaadon kaa naam krishna par rakhaa he or kaha tha ki company kaa is shabd par daawa uchit nahin he
 Citing its high sales figures, Bhole Baba Milk Food Industries Limited had said that the word Krishna has created a distinct identity in relation to its milk products, hence it has a specific right over the word
 parul food speshilities ne haalanki, iskaa virodh kiya or kaha ki krishna ek saamaanya shabd he or yah bhagwaan krishna se bhi judaa he jinka makkhan, doodh or ghi se gaharaa naata rahaa he, isliye koi bhi isapar apana ekadhikaar nahin jataa saktaa

 # Aa Rahi Hoon! @iamsrk @ritesh_sid @rahuldholakia @faroutakhtara post shared by Sunny Leone (@sunnyleone) on Dec 18, 2016 at 8:38 pm PST yah mahaz sanyog hi hoga kii sita kii janmasthali sitamarhi zile ke log piem narendra modi ke naa aane ke baavjood khush hai or raja janak kii nagari janakapur ke log utane hi zyada dukhi or gusse main dikh rahe hai
 In fact, since the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's possible program to visit Janakpur came, the Bihar government was able to shine the 30 km long road from Sitamarhi to Bhitmore to Puri Mustadi
 yah rashtriya rajmarg hai
 Local people say that the diversions that were in this route, they were first struck and now it has become a paved road and now it can reach the Nepal border in half an hour at a speed
 vahiin nepal ke log bhi pehle kaaphi khush the, kyonki bhitthamod seemaa se janakapur kii jo 19 kilometre kii duuri dedh ghante main puri hoti thi, vahaan bhi kaam laga yaa kahiye kaam laga hua he, lekin bhartiya pradhanmantri ke naa aane kii khabar se un logon ko ashanka he ki sadak main maujuud gaddhon ko mitti daal kar bharne kaa jo kaam ho rahaa tha, vah shaayad ab band ho jaae
 An Engineer of Nepal Sarkar's Road Department was crying that the Indian company to whom this road construction contract was awarded was not working
 jabaki, nepal ke logon kaa kahana he rangadari maange jane ke kaaran kaam nahin ho paa rahaa
 According to the people of Janakpur, he was quite hopeful that Prime Minister Modi would definitely come up with some solution to diagnose the problem of the people of Terai region on the pretext of visiting the Janaki temple
 piem modi kii is yatra se judi unki ummiido kaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki un logon kaa maananaa he kii modi samasya sunate nahin, balki unki research team unhen ek-ek cheez ke bare main pehle se avgat kara detii he
 Madhesi leaders would also shine their politics on the same excuse as PM Modi, because the last time he met Modi in Kathmandu, he was very disappointed, but this opportunity has also gone by his hand
 samaajawaadee party (espi) ke saansad ajam khan ke sitare in dinon gardish main chal rahe hai
 After being declared a land mafia, he has not come to his home district Rampur for almost a month
 pehle jab vah vidhayak the or lakhanu main rahete the to aamtaur par shanivaar or ravivaar ko apane paitruk nivas rampur main hi bitaate the
 Azam Khan, who defeated veteran BJP leader Jaya Prada in the Lok Sabha elections, is now accused of capturing farmers' land and rivers
 un par 26 se zyada mukademe hai
 Now the question is whether Azam Khan is not coming to Rampur for fear of arrest? SP Ajay Pal Sharma told IANS that there could be an arrest in the currents on SP leader Azam
 aisa nahin he ki vah rampur aaenge to ham unhen giraftaar kar lenge
 "ever since Azam Khan has been booked, he has not appeared in Rampur," SP leader Akhilesh Yadav said, "SP MP Azam Khan is not avoiding anyone from coming to Rampur
" bas parliament chal rahi he
 That is why he has been busy
 pehle bhi vah jab uttar pradesh sarkaar main mantri the to har shanivaar, ravivaar ko amuman rampur hi rahete the
 Here is his ancestral residence
 abhi jab se satr chal he tab se vah yahaan nahin aae hai
 The rest of the case is about political reasons
 jald hi unako isse nijaat milegi
 'he said,' Parliament has been in session for almost 25 days
 uske alawa unki patni kii tabiyat bhi thik nahin he or vah bhartee hai
 So, they have to look after them as well
 vah jald hi rampur aaenge
 'district Magistrate Anjaney Kumar Singh told IANS,' Azam Khan is our MP, he is a public representative
 unke aane-jane par kisi prakaar kii koi roak prashasan ne nahin lagaai he
 But he has come here only once after taking oath
 yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki jabase unke upar maamle darj hue hai tabase vah rampur main dikhaai nahin die hai
 Faisal Khan Lala, state vice-president of the Congress Minorities Department, said, "azam Khan is accused of taking possession of farmers' land and rivers
 un par 26 se zyada mukademe hai
 He is also a land mafia
 ajam ne kisaanon kii jameen par sio ali hasan ke saath milakar kabja kiya he
 Azam Khan knows that if he comes to Rampur, he will be arrested
 isi kaaran vah aa nahin rahe hai
 At the moment he has not come to Rampur for a month
 rampur na aane kaa ek kaaran yah he ki unhone kuch galat kiya he
 They have some noise
 bijepi ke pradesh pravaktaa or rampur ke prabharee doctor chandramohan ne kaha, 'sarkaar bhoomafiaon ke khilaaf sakhti se kadam uthaa rahi he
 They will not be dropped at any cost
 espi ke saansad kaa sach saamne aa rahaa he
 That is why he is hiding his mouth
 garibon, kisaanon, alpsankhyakon kii jameen par ajam khan ne kabj kiya hua he
 In such a situation, with what face will you face the farmers of Rampur
 unhone kaha ki yogi sarkaar ne bhoomafiaon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii he
 For this reason, a land mafia like Atiq Ahmed is having to face the pressure of jail
 sarkaar kanoon-vyavastha se kisi prakaar kaa samjhauta karne vaali nahin he
 Significantly, the problems of senior Samajwadi Party (SP) leader and MP Azam Khan, trapped in more than two dozen cases, do not seem to be reducing

 antarrashtriya strapar kachche tel kii keemton main lagaataar ijapha ho rahaa he
 The effect of this is seen in the form of increase in the prices of petrol and diesel in the country
 pichley ek maheene ke bheetar petrol or dijal kii keemton main 1
 There has been an increase of more than 50 rupees
 kachche tel kii keemton kii vajah se aam aadmi par pad rahe boj ko lekar sarkaar se philhal raahat kii ummid kam he
 'look what can happen', Oil Minister Dharmendra, who arrived at an event, said only to give relief to the common man from the rising prices of petrol and diesel, 'see, what can happen
 ' aise main kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki centre sarkaar kii taraf se petrol-dijal kii badhati keemton se raahat milane kii ummid kam he
 These are the current prices in Delhi, where one liter petrol 69 on Friday
 85 rupee par he, to vahiin,dijalabhi 58
 31 per liter
 kachche tel kii keemten 60 dollar prati bairal se upar pahunch gai hai
 This is directly impacting the prices of petrol and diesel
 jisaki vajah se din-ba-din inaki keemton main ijapha ho rahaa he
 There may be little hope of getting relief from the government at the moment of ball-petrol-diesel prices in the states
 isaki ek vajah yah bhi he ki haal main centre sarkaar ne petrol or dijal par lagane vaali exise duty ghatai thi
 In such a situation, the central government can put the ball in the states' court
 waite ghataane ko lekar bad saktaa he dabaavacentre sarkaar ke 5 fisadi waite ghataane kii apil karne ke baad abhi tak kuch hi rajyon ne waite ghataya he
 If the prices of petrol and diesel continue to rise like this, the pressure on states to reduce VAT may increase
 agar maharashtra or gujarat samet anya rajyon main bhi waite se raahat milti he, to petrol-dijal kii keemto kii maar kam ho sakati he
 Daily pricing is becoming troublesome
 In 2016, when the Modi government decided to fix prices of daily petrol and diesel, it was said that this would reduce prices and provide relief to the common man, but it does not seem to be happening
 pehle kachche tel kii keemton kaa asar aam logon par 15 dinon ke baad padataa tha
 Now every day, the impact of the changes in the prices of crude oil is being seen
 kya jiesti he aakhri rasta?oil ministar dharmendra pradhan, maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis samet kai log petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke tahat laane kii maang uthaa chuke hai
 In such a situation, to get relief from the rising prices of petrol and diesel, the government may also consider bringing it under GST

 dilli-ensiaar main jald hi ap aadhaarit nai cab seva shuru hone ja rahi he
 Cab driver union 'chalik Shakti' will introduce an app-based taxi service named 'seva Cab'
 union kaa kahana he ki 7 april se yah seva shuru ho jaaegi
 It is being claimed that 'service cabs' will provide cabs at cheaper rates than existing Ola and Uber
 chaalak shakti union kii ore se jari bayaan main kaha gaya he ki 17 se 31 march se is ap se drivers judana shuru kar denge
 It is being told that the service cab app will be launched with 5000 drivers
 tippaniyan It is known that in February this year, more than one lakh drivers belonging to Ola and Uber went on an indefinite strike
 driveron kii maang thi ki unhen behatar protsaahan mili saath hi ap ke saath nayi texiyon ko jodna roka jaae kyonki isse unki booking (aamadani) prabhavit hoti he
 In view of this demand of drivers, special arrangements have been made for the drivers who join the 'seva Cab' app

 Ah, poor plaintiff, people spending their days in jails
 ” unki aawaaj thodi-si kanpakanpai
 He looked at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said, "in the name of development and progress, i request you to understand the generosity of opportunity and see that criticism is not enough
" ” vaakya adhuraa chhot gaya, shabdon ke bich ke tehraav lambey ho gaye
 In a jolt the head rose and eyes widened
 yah us shaks kii aawaaj thi, jo apni jubaan ko apane jajbaat jaahir karne se rokane kii jaddojahad kar rahaa tha
 But this was not just any person
 manch par khadey yah desh ke 43wein pradhan nyaayadhish tirath singh thakur the
 His jaws were clenched, his eyes clenched, his hand in his pocket in search of a handkerchief to wipe his eyes
 dilli ke vigyaan bhawan main 25 april ko sannata chaa gaya, hairaan-pareshaan log ek duusare kii ore dekhne lage
 The Prime Minister was looking at the stage with serious eyes
 darasal, pradhan nyaayadhish ko kul 37 minute or chaar second lage jab unhone raashtra ko chaunkkar dhyaan dene ke liye majaboor kar diya
 This is the exact time in which judges across the country complete an average of 15 hearings and decide seven cases
 aisa isliye he kyonki vyastatam adaalaton ke jaj ek mukademe kii sunwaayee main ausat 2
 Spend 5 minutes and decide a case in about five minutes
 isliye nahin ki hamaare jaj kisi hadabadi main hai, balki isliye ki desh main jajon kii is kadar kami he ki ve ek mukademe ko isse zyada vakt bamushkil hi de sakate hai
 As was mentioned in the Lok Sabha on March 3, 2016, there is a shortage of 44 per cent in the High Courts, 25 per cent in the lower courts and 19 per cent in the Supreme Court
 chaar nek sachaaiyanpradhan nyaayadhish kii takreer main daleel ke chaar pahalu the
 One, the judges are heavily burdened with lawsuits
 do, nyaaypalika ke khaali padon ko nahin bharaa ja rahaa he
 Three, the appointment process is stuck at the government level due to unknown reasons
 chaar, insaaf ke pahiyon ko sucharu rup se nahin ghumaya jayega, to uski maar sabase zyada aam aadmi ko jhelni padegi
 The Law Commission has been screaming since 1987, along with 15 Chief Justices made in the last 29 years have been pleading that there is a dire need to increase the number of courts and judges, only then justice will really matter
 magar is jarurat kaa surkhiyaan bananaa bhi band ho gaya tha
 It has again come into the limelight with the Chief Justice's passionate appeal for justice's justice
 usee din baad main ek press conference main pradhan nyaayadhish ne kaha, “jajbaati hona kamajori kii nishaani he, kisi ko jajbaati nahin hona chahie
 
 
 But there is also some commitment to the judiciary
 ”jane-maane kanoonvid ram jethmalani kehete hai, “yah sarkaron kii jaani-buujhi laaparvaahee hi he jisane nyaaypalika ko is kadar abhaavon kii haalat main dhakel diya he
 "they also say," Just 0 of the budget allocations to the judiciary
 5 fisadi hi miltaa he
 The Chief Justice's tears also caught the Prime Minister's attention
 25 april ko us aayojan main modi kaa bolnaa tay nahin tha
 But Modi took the microphone in hand and said that he considers the pain of the Chief Justice
 unhone pradhan nyaayadhish or unke varisht jajon ko apane or apni cabinet ke saathiyon ke saath band kamare main ek baithak ke liye aamantrit kiya, “aaie dekhen ki ateet ke boj ko kam karke aage kaise badha jaae
 The tough judge also surprised the Supreme Court lawyers
 mridubhashi or dhairyavan nyaayamurti thakur gussell or agbabula hone ke liye bhi jane jate hai
 Advocates cite countless such occasions when they took on high and mighty people
 ve bataate hai, “varisht vakil or purv kendriya mantri kapil sibbal sahaara pramukh subrat raay kii rihaai kii apil kar rahe the or pradhan nyaayadhish ne unase kaha, “tathyon or kanoonon ke aadhaar par tark den, har vakt hamen bhaashan na den
 "he also cites the BCCI reforms, the Saradha scam and even the Prime Minister's favorite project of cleaning the Ganges
 sarkari vakeelon se unka yah kahana khaasaa mashhoor he ki “aapaki kaaryayojna se to 200 saal main bhi ganga saaf nahin hogi
 "his reputation for rigorous handling has led to confusion and differences at the bottom lines
 kuch vakeelon ne gahari niraashaa jaahir kii, “hamaare samvidhan main pradhan nyaayadhish kii behad ahm jagah he
 He should not have cried in front of the Prime Minister
 ” to kuch is sadame ko jajb nahin kar sake, “pradhan nyaayadhish apni sakhti ke liye jane jate hai
 Senior lawyers also sweat in front of them in court
 ” kuch vakeelon kaa kahana he ki supreme court sarkaar ko apana kartavya puraa karne ke liye param aadesh yaa mandaimas jari kar saktaa tha
 Others describe how it would have been seen as "judicial excess
" vahiin, kuch vakeelon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki yah ranneetik tevar tha, “hamen jajon kii jarurat he
 full stop
 ek beintahaa jarurat kii taraf logon kaa dhyaan khinchne kaa akelaa tarika, khaskar tab jab engeesi ko lekar apni haar ke baad modi sarkaar nyaayik sudhaaron kii tamaam koshishon ko thap karne par tuli he
 Ati's haunting picture is that this moment has completed a tumultuous year of turmoil between the Modi government and the judiciary
 pichley saal 5 april ko thik isi manch se takaraav shuru hua tha
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the head of the executive of the country, took the judiciary in the same place and that too publicly
 unhone kaha tha, “hindustan kii nyaaypalika tamaam staron par taqatvar hoti ja rahi he, vahiin yah bhi jaruri he ki vah logon kii ummiido par khara utarane ke liye mukammal bhi bane
 "in a way, it was an event that triggered months of squabbles and conflicts between the two pillars of Indian democracy
 yah aakhirkaar pradhanmantri kii ek ahm vidhaayi koshish kii naakaami kii taraf le gai
 The government created an NJAC of six members to replace the collegium system of choosing fellow judges to its advantage in the hands of senior judges
 is nae ayog se oonchi adaalaton main niyuktiyon or duusare naitikta se jude muddon ko prabhavit karne kii takat karypalika ko mil jaati
 Upendra Bakshi, a professor of law at Britain's University of Warwick, says, "the government may have embraced it, but it is clear that the confrontation between the judiciary and the political class is not over yet
" ”baat sirf engeesi kii hi nahin he
 The fine line between judicial activism and judicial excess will continue to haunt the judiciary until it swiftly recovers its home
 pramukh nyayavid fali es
 Nariman questions how he is appointed? Why are they appointed? What are their drawbacks? They say, "ask them and they will say," You have nothing to do with this
 ham jaanate hai ki nyaaypalika ke liye kya acha he
 “the collegium system is undoubtedly at its root
 ati ke aaropon kii jad bhi jaanch or mukademon ko haankane kii sheersh adaalat kii ichha main he
 The failure of the NJAC was seen in the words of Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley as "the autocracy of the undecided"
 pradhan nyaayadhish is baat ko jaanate hai
 While holding the reins on December 2, 2015, he had said, “the judiciary is facing the biggest challenge of its recent times
 ” engeesi kanoon ko radd karne se logon ke man main yah dharna bani ki nyaaypalika ne jajon ko niyukt karne kaa adhikaar hasil kar liya he
 Now he needs to fill the vacant posts in courts across the country and live up to his expectations
 “mukhya nyaayadhishon or supreme court ke nyaayadhishon ko padonnati ke liye logon ko chunate vakt apni antaratma kii aawaaj ke mutabik hi chalanaa chahie
 "to make things easier for streamlining appointments, the Chief Justice set up a constitutional court in January to reduce the burden of pending cases related to interpreting the Constitution
" magar farvari tak chijen sahi disha main nahin ja rahi thim or pradhan nyaayadhish nyaayik niyuktiyon ke lekar “haath par haath dhare baithne ke liey sarkaar ko doshi tehraate hue “sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kaa audit karwaane” kaa aahvaan kar rahe the
 From March, the Chief Justice began to question why the Intelligence Bureau should take months to get the Supreme Court collegium to recommend the judges
 sarkaar ke paas maheenon se lambit pade 170 jajon kii niyukti ke prastaavon kii taraf ishaara karte hue, jab inamen se 90 fisadi maujuuda jaj hi hai, 9 april ko pradhan nyaayadhish ne poocha tha ki “pradhanmantri karyaalay ibi se report 15 dinon ke bheetar dene ke liye kyon nahin kah saktaa?”sansad ke sheet satr main ucch nyaayalayon kii vanijyik adaalaton, vanijyik vibhaagon or vanijyik apiliy vibhaag adhinium, 2015 paarit kar diya gaya
 The aim was to change the way we deal with commercial lawsuits and reduce delays
 yah bhi ek chubhane vaala mudda rahaa he-alag se maanavbal or buniyadi dhaancha die bagaiyr pehle hi bahut saare khaali padon kii dikkat se jujh rahi maujuuda adaalaton main se nai adaalatein banaai ja rahi hai
 The other solution may be for the Bar Council to use judicial academies more and more
 vibhinn rajyon main acadamiyon kii sthapana kii ja rahi he taaki nyaayik adhikariyon or vakeelon ko prashikshan diya ja sake
 a separate judicial administrative corp can also provide the manpower it needs
 sheersh adaalat ne nyaaypalika kii kul shakti ko paanch saal main 30,000 tak le jane kaa lakshya tay kiya he
 The key to judicial reforms lies in taking the initiative
 adaalaton se jitani aasaani se sthagan hasil kar liye jate hai, usko niyantrit karne kii jarurat he
 Extending hearing dates delays civil lawsuits
 sthagan ke vaazib aadhaaron ko simit karke or kuch aantarik niyamon ke saath-saath pradhan nyaayadhish kii sakht hidaayaton se lambit mukademon main acchhee-khaasi kami laai ja sakati he
 The problem of delay can be overcome to a large extent by bringing modern methods and technology
 seva se lekar samman tak or jamaanat tak, nyaay pranali main har kaam haath se kiya jaataa he
 Fifty percent judicial delay is due to lack of summons, arguments on the validity of summons, reasonable identification, etc
 chhuttiyon ne nahin, puraane jamaane ke taur-tareekon ne adaalaton ko jakad rakhaa he
 How about increasing working hours? The Supreme Court works for 193 days, High Court 120 days and District Court 245 days in a year
 ek diggaj nyaayadhish ne kabhi likhaa tha ki jaj hona “ek visheshadhikaar, ek sukh or ek kartavya” he
 The troubled and troubled Chief Justice is clearly neither a good omen for the brotherhood of the Indian judges nor for the country
 kyon or kaise par barason bahasein chalati rahengi
 Meanwhile, data from a survey by Daksha India, a Bangalore-based legal research firm, was only given to India Today to shed light on some aspects of this setback

 However, many members of the Constituent Assembly were against maintaining the administrative service and Nehru himself expressed reluctance to continue it
 patel ne aktubar 1949 main samvidhan sabha main elaan kiya, "(bharat) sangh tut jayega, aapako united india nahin milegaa, agar aapke paas ek acchhee akhil bhartiya seva nahin hogi, jise apane man kii baat kehane kii aazaadee ho

 This was also done by Tejashwi Yadav in a tweet in which he said that Nitish Kumar believed that JDU is an advanced version of BJP
 yahi vajah he ki vah apane alaava sabhi sanvaidhanik pad amit shah se poochkar hi de rahe hai
 i hope that now you will understand why mob lynching and crime have become a common thing in the state

 Amit Shah
 Hope now you understand,why Mob Lynchings & State Sponsored Crimes have become a routine practice in Bihar?gauratlab he ki isse pehle bihar ke mukhyamantri or jadyu ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitish kumaar ne khulaasa kiya tha ki bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ke kehane par unhone prashanth kishor ko jadyu (jdu)kaa rashtriya upaadhyaksh banaaya tha

 Former Minister of State for Home Swami Chinmayananda has told Azam Khan's hand behind this
 viechpi ne elaan kar diya he ki goli chale yaa lathi, lekin churaasi kosi yatra jarur hogi
 But the Samajwadi government has expressed a fear of deteriorating law and order with the Chaurasi Kosi Yatra

 At a party event here, Gadkari said, "I want to know whether all the spectacle (disruption) took place without the consent of Sonia Gandhi in the PAC meeting held in the Parliament House complex?" Did this happen without the Prime Minister's permission? Both have remained silent on this issue so far

 iske liye koi samay seemaa nahin tay kii gayi lekin bhartiya paksh ne kaha ki ve is samasya ko jaldi se jaldi hal karnaa chahenge
 In Singh's first meeting with Sharif, who was recently elected Prime Minister, talks focused primarily on building stability around the Line of Control and preventing terrorism being leveled against India from the Pakistani territory
 donon pradhanmantriyon ne ek duusare ko rajkeey yatra ke liye aamantrit kiya or donon ne use sweekaar bhi kar liya, lekin inaki taarikh ke bare main koi sanket nahin diya gaya he
 Given the current state of bilateral relations and the end of his tenure, there is a slim chance that Singh's intention to visit Pakistan will be fulfilled where he was born 81 years ago

 In the briefing, Menon completely denied the allegations of India's interference in Balochistan, saying, 'there is no evidence
 agar koi saboot he to hamane use nahin dekha he
 On the question of a Pakistani journalist that India is the axis of terrorism in Pakistan, Menon retorted, 'I have not heard of any such concern
 agar koi saboot he to ham us par dhyaan denge
 There is no evidence of India spreading terrorism
 kaash main kah paata ki vastut: sthiti iske ulat he
 Asked whether the views of the army and Sharif are the same, Jilani said, "all institutions in Pakistan have the same views

 All decisions are taken with consent

 ' lambey arase se bijepi se naaraaz chal rahe shatrughna sinha ne shanivaar ko congress kaa daaman tham hi liya
 After joining the Congress, Shotgun has been given ticket from Patna Sahib, after which now Shatrughan Sinha from Patna Sahib will directly hand over the BJP leader and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad
 bijepi ke sthapana diwas ke din hi bijepi kaa daaman chhod congress ke angan main aae shatrughna ne piem modi or bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke khilaaf jabardast gole daage
 Shatrughan's political career In 1984, when Shatrughan held the lotus of the Bharatiya Janata Party under Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the party made him the star campaigner of the party at that time because of his powerful personality and loud voice
 saal 1992 main shatrughna ko pehali baar nai dilli loksabhaa seat se rajesh khanna ke khilaaf utaara gaya
 Shatrughan Sinha had said in an interview that fighting elections against his friend Rajesh Khanna is the biggest regret of his life
 iske baad saal 1996 or 2002 main endie ne unhen rajyasabha main bheja
 After becoming cabinet minister in 2003 and 2004, Patna Sahib seat of Bihar won him the mp's crown in 2009 and 2014
 aisa bataaya jaataa he ki aaj apni hi party se ritair ho chuke laal krishna adwani shatru ko raajnneeti main lekar aae the
 Look at the time, today, neither Advani remained in BJP nor Shatrughan's party
 tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ji shatru se itane prabhavit the ki sinha ko atal ji ne 2003 main swasthya mantri banaaya or 2004 main jahajrani mantri bana diya
 Significantly, he is the first actor to become a Union Minister
 2009 or 2014 main patna sahib se aam chunaav main jeet chuke shatrughna philhal 16veen loksabhaa ke saansad hai
 Why left 'kamal' Today, Sinha became the bjp's 'enemy' for the seat of Patna Sahib, he won elections for the first time in 2009 and became an MP
 iske baad 2014 ke aam chunaavon main bhi shotgan ne phir se patna sahib se shandaar jeet hasil kii, iske baavjood bhi bijepi alaakaman ne loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye patna sahib se unka tikat kaat diya or kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ko thama diya
 When Ravi Shankar Prasad reached Patna Sahib on Shatrughan's ticket, Sinha's displeasure with the BJP leadership began to come forward
 ve lagaataar bijepi ke khilaaf bayaanbaji karne lage
 He began to criticize the decisions of the government through open forums
 unke baagi tevar tab or pakke dikhne lage jab beete janvari ko mamata banerjee ke bulaave par mahagathbandhan kii raily main kolkata pahunch gaye
 From there, Shatrughan almost made it clear from the stage that he left the party and stood with the opposition
 patna sahib kii ‘ladaai’bihar kii rajdhani patna ko saal 2008 main loksabhaa kshetra ke hisaab se do bhaagon main baanta gaya
 The first Lok Sabha constituency became Patna Sahib and the second was Pataliputra
 saal 2009 main patna sahib main hue pehle hi chunaav main shatrughna sinha ne vijayi dhvaj fahraaya
 After this, Bihari Babu was victorious in the Patna Sahib Lok Sabha in the 2014 general elections as well
 gauratlab he ki patna sahib kaa chunaav shuru se hi filmi sitaron ke bich hota rahaa, lekin har baar baaji bihari babu ne maari
 Shotgun defeated film stars Shekhar Suman in 2009 and Kunal Singh in 2014 from the same Lok Sabha
 patna sahib loksabhaa kshetra main 6 vidhansabha kshetra hai, jinamein se bakhtiyarpur, digha, bankipur, kumharar or patna sahib kii siton par bijepi kaa kabja he
 At the same time, Fatuha seat is named after RJD
 bataaya jaataa he ki patna sahib main yadav, rajput or kysth votaron kii sankhya zyada he
 Perhaps this is the reason why BJP gave ticket to Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad in place of Shatrughan Sinha

 The meeting, led by National Party President Amit Shah, was held at the party headquarters in Delhi
 baithak main gujarat party prabharee samet kai bade netaa shaamil hue
 In fact, all the exit polls for the Gujarat elections are being shown in favor of polbjp
 lekin agsit pole antim parinaam nahin hai, ye bas ek anumaan he
 In such a situation, if the election result is less than expected or equal, then what kind of strategy will be adopted, the matter is being discussed in the meeting
 baithak main tamaam diggaj maujuddilli main chal rahi is baithak amit shah ke alaava ram laal, smriti irani, nirmala sitaraman, prakaash jaavdekar or minakshi lekhi maujuud raheen

 Like many mothers, Sheryl Leach kisses her teenage son on the lips
 unka betaa jordan lagbhag 16 saal kaa hoga
 Jordan, who is five feet four inches tall, still needs to be told that he should not throw his socks on the floor
 use kai choti-choti baton ko ab bhi samajhane kii jarurat padati he
 Despite this, Sheryl has no complaints with him
 jab jordan skool se lautataa he to wo roj apane skool bag ko farsh par phenkakar sofe par let jaataa he
 Sheryl continues to stare at her with love
 kuch der baad wo uske paas aati hai or uske chehre ko apni hatheliyon se pakadakar uske hothon par kis karti hai
 Did you find it strange to read this last sentence? If you also found something strange about kissing, then tell me that you are not alone in feeling like this
 maa-baap ko apane bacchon ke hothon par kis karnaa chahie yaa nahin? ye sawaal bahes kaa mudda ban chukaa he
 Some people consider it as a way of expressing love, while some say that it is not right
 ise hinsa ke rup main dekha janaa chahie
 Last year, child-psychiatric doctor Sherlot Resnik faced controversies over the same question
 unka kahana tha ki mana aap apane bachche ke hothon par kis karte hai lekin kis umr tak? hothon par kis karnaa us samay tak sahi he jab takbache ko sex or usase judi baton kii jaankaree na ho
 But after sexual awareness comes, kissing the child on his lips is not right
 isse usamen uttejnaa aa sakati he
 Also, watching mother and son lip-to-lip kisses can be uncomfortable for others
 kai baar unhen is tarah dekhakar lagata he ki wo ek kapal hai, joki kisi bhi sthiti main sahi nahin he
 On the other hand, Sherlot calls this controversy a complete nonsense
 unka kahana he ki wo jordan ko kis karnaa kabhi band nahin karengi
 When Jordan was asked the same question, he also said that he has been doing this since childhood and he finds it absolutely normal
 shaiyrlot jab garbhvatee thim tabhi unke pati unhen chhodkar chale gaye the
 Sherlot and Jordan have spent years of life together
 haalanki ab shaiyrlot ne duusari shaadi kar lee he lekin us vakt se hi maa or bete ke bich rishta bahut gaharaa ho gaya
 This is also the reason why they have no objection in doing so
 shaiyrlot bataati hai ki bahut saalon tak jordan mere bistar par hi sota tha or usne sex se judi apni utsukata bhi unke saath share kii he
 Jordan also has a female friend but she has no problem with Jordan's habit
 ek ore jahaan shaiyrlot jaise abhibhavak ise bachche ke prati apane pyaar ko jataane kaa ek tarika maanate hai vahiin jordan jaise bachche ise saport kii tarah dekhte hai
 They do not see anything wrong in this
 par manovaigyanik maanate hai ki sexual awarenes aa jane ke baad bacchon ko lip tu lip kis karnaa sahi nahin he
 The Congress government may have come to Madhya Pradesh, but it is clear from the statements of former BJP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh that the BJP is going to create problems for the Congress at every step
 bhaajapa ke purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne do bayanon ke jariye congress sarkaar ko gheraa he
 Yesterday at a gathering of activists of Budhni, he told the workers that there is no need to fear that Tiger is still alive
 congress kii sarkaar 5 saal tikegi yah sawaal uthaakar shivaraj ne sawalia nishaan khadey kar die
 Has Shivraj Singh Chauhan, the chief minister for 13 years, still not missed the chair's fascination? Is Shivraj still dreaming of power? Does Shivraj want to change the Congress government without a majority? These questions are arising after Shivraj's statement that Shivraj is seen saying that 'his return may not take even 5 years'
 ji haa, buudhvaar ko shivaraj singh chouhan ne siem house main apana aakhri kaarykram kiya or apni vidhansabha kshetra budhani ke kaaryakartaaon se mulaakaat kii
 Addressing the workers, Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that this is the last event in this dome, on hearing this, the female worker sitting there spoke aloud, "brother, will come again after five years
" '' is par purv siem shivaraj singh ne kaha ''ho saktaa he paanch bhi puure na lagen
 "shivraj did not stop here, he told the workers that he did not have to worry because the tiger is still alive", telling himself that he is a tiger
 Statements of BJP leaders are also indicating that something in the BJP is cooking
 is
 purv siem shivaraj singh chouhan BJP haari nahin he balki siton ke ankaganit main pichhadi he
 Even after getting more votes, we fell behind the seats, but now we have the job of watchman and hence i repeat again positive cooperation in development, but if there is problem for the public, then i have told the public not to worry about the public
 vahiin bijepi pradesh adhyaksh ne bhi kaha ki ye sarkaar kamazor sarkaar he or isliye hamen maaloom nahi kii unke aapas ke kaarnon se hi ye sarkaar kitni chalegi
 'shivraj still dreaming of power' - Congress; Congress has said on the statement of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan that BJP has not recovered from the mentality of defeat that the people have defeated it
 congress pravaktaa pankaj chaturvedi ne kaha ki shivaraj ko abhi bhi satta ke sapane aa rahe hai
 Talking to Aaj Tak, Pankaj Chaturvedi said, 'I think that Shivraj should follow the democratic process and the Congress government is formed and everyone's public opinion should be respected
 main isko sweekaar karata hum ki aapaki 15 saal sarkaar rahi jisamen aap 13 saal siem rahe to bahut kathin hota he satta ke bagaiyr rahanaa
 The former Chief Minister will have dreams of power, he will be shocked
 aapako bataa den ki madhyapradesh vidhansabha main bahumat kaa aankada 116 he lekin congress ke paas 114 siten hai
 With the support of independents, BSP, SP, the Congress had easily secured a majority and hence BJP has been reluctant to accept defeat from the beginning

 This film is a blockbuster for Salman's fans, there are no two opinions in it
 lekin ali abbaas jafar ke diarection main bani film asal main kisi he,padhein rivyuu
 Salman Khan's India begins from 15 August 1947 on the day of independence
 is din janm hota he bharat kaa (salmaan khan kaa janmdin)
 Now when there is a birthday, there will also be celebrations, then this celebration begins by going with the whole family on the attic border, cutting the cake while running behind the moving train
 lekin kek kaatane se pehle bharat sunaata he ghar ke bacchon ko apni kahani, bas yaheen se kahani chal padati he

 asif shaikh kaa role bhale hi chota ho, lekin powerful he
 Tabu, Sonali Kulkarni have also done justice to their characters
 ali abbaas jafar ke nirdesan kii isliye bhi tarif kerani chahie ki unhone bharat kii kahani ko bojhil nahin hone diya he
 Editing and location are effective in many places

 Was there any evidence after the raid on Deputy CM, Arvind Kejriwal and Satyendar Jain? We have always defended our ministers, but the way the Center is putting obstacles is a big political conspiracy
