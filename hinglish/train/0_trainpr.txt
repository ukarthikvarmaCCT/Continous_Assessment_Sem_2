 Live-in relationship is quite prevalent among these youth living away from home

 The main symptom of electoral politics here is obviously the anti-incumbency atmosphere i

 ham apane vikalp khule rakhte hai, daaen-baayen dolate rahete hai lekin logon kaa apni pasand ke hisaab se vot karne kaa adhikaar bachaae rakhte hai
 "this understanding of the professor actually comes from the traditional electoral scenario of Kerala in which only two political fronts have been firmly present in every election for years
 is baar kaa vidhansabha chunaav us paridrishy ko tod rahaa he or yahaan kii raajnneeti buniyadi rup se badalane kaa sanket de rahi he
 This signal is coming from a possible third front emerging from the nexus between the BJP and the Bharatiya Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) which could spoil the traditional political balance

 One of the problems of BJP is that Nair, the second dominant Hindu community, is not going with the Third Front as the Nair Service Society representing it has decided
 2011 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ko is samudaay ke 11 fisadi vot mili the, yani hindu voton kaa dhruvikaran ab bhi kerala ke liye ek sudur sambhaavna hi he
 The formation of the Third Front, however, gives some relief to UMF of Umman Chandy as it has the ability to divide anti-incumbency votes

 Who will vote for the Chandi government in the event of scams, price rise in basic things, falling law and order etc
? Kerala's political temperature in March has increased tremendously and there is not a single leader who has not realized it

 The battle to live and die has started here for every front

 Chandy came to the Legislative Assembly from Puthupalli in Kottayam for the first time in 1970 at the age of 26

 vies kii tarah party ke purv sachiv or paulitte beuro sadsy 72 varshiya pinaraai vijayan bhi kaddavar netaa hai jinaki party par majboot pakad he
 Within the party, there has been a fierce battle for supremacy between the two during the last 12 years
 donon netaaon ke chaahane vaale baraabar hai-pinaraai yadi rajya cameti par niyantran rakhte hai to sadakon va galiyon main maujuud sipiem ke kader ab bhi vies ke prati vafaadaar hai
 So this time when the Politburo of the CPM decided to field both in the elections and to ignore the question of the Chief Ministerial candidate for the present, it was seen as a strategic compromise
 seetaram yechuri 2015 main jab party ke mahasachiv bane the to unke saamne kerala ko lekar ek jaruri kaam tha-aapas main lard rahe dhadon ke bich aman kaayam karnaa
 His intervention was impressive because VS had great faith in him and also because he explained to the leaders that "without unity, the party will be like Bengal
" ”india today ne tiruanantpuram ke ekege centre main jab pinaraai se mulaakaat kii, to ve puure aatmavishvaas main dikhe ki sipiem chunaav main jeet rahi he
 He said, "the political atmosphere is in our favor

 Under WTO rules, the government can levy a maximum of 45 percent duty on edible oils
 punjab aayal mills associyeshan ke adhyaksh susheel jain ne kaha, ‘‘bajet main sarkaar ko gharelu khaadya tel udyog ke hit main dirghakaalik kadam uthaane chaiye
 If the import duty is increased on the crude oil of soybean digum, rapeseed and sunflower, then the farmers will also get benefit
 ''jain ne kaha, ‘‘soyabean digam, repasid, surajamukhi kachche tel par aayaat shulk ko badha kar rifind ke najadik le jaaya jaae
 He argued that the import duty on their crude oil is 35 percent and on refined 45 percent, while the cost of processing these crude oils is not much, hence the temptation to import them in the domestic market is high
 ek anya khaadya tel udhyami or janaki prasad and company ke aayush gupta ne kaha ki malaysia ke saath aktubar 2010 ke vyapaar samjhaute ke tahat sarkaar ne vahaan ke rifind pamolin par shulk gata kar 45 pratishat or kachche pom tel par aayaat shulk ko badhaakar 40 pratishat kar diya he

 ' khaadya tel udyog ke aankadon ke mutabik desh main kul 225 lakh ton khaadya telon kii khapat he jisamen se kareeb 160 lakh ton telon kaa aayaat kiya jaataa he
 Of this, 90 to 100 lakh tons of crude and refined palm oil are imported, while the remaining 60 to 7 million tons of soybean degum, rapeseed and other oils are imported
 tel udyog ke vyapaariyon kaa kahana he ki is baar desh main sarson kii fasal acchhee hui he
 The government has raised the minimum support price of mustard to Rs 4,200 a quintal, but concerns over farmers 'and traders' concern that the price will go below the support price in view of higher production

 Gupta said that Cottonseed Khal is exempted from GST whereas Mecca Khal which is very beneficial for cattle in milk production is applicable at the rate of five percent GST
 unhone kaha ki desh main binaula khal kaa 60 lakh ton utpaadan he jabaki makka khal abhi badhata udyog he aura iskaa do lakh ton utpaadan ho rahaa he
 Traders say that one tree of palmolein crops for 25-30 years, hence the cost of palmolein oil comes down

 tivi par 22 april 2019 ko launch hua serial ek bhram
 
 
 There is news of the omnipresence of the all-rounder
 launch hone se pehle is sho ko lekar jabardast baj bana hua tha
 There was a lot of excitement among the fans about Shrenu Parikh and Jain Imam's show
 lekin kamjor plot ke chalate ek bhram
 
 
 All the virtues could not stand the test of the rich audience
 ek bhram
 
 
 The TRP report of all-rounders is quite useless

 An illusion

 On September 13, Shrenu Parikh's show may be of the year
 agar ye khabar sahi hui to shrenu paarikh kaa sho mahaj 5 maheene main hi band ho jayega

 All-rounder, the show's storyline was quite tableau
 serial kii starcast bhi strong he
 The show's trailer was also well received
 ek parfect bahu kaise apane hi parivaar ko barbaad karti he, is concept ne tivi audiyans main halapal paidaa kii thi
 But with increasing episodes, the makers were not able to present the show's starlines well
 kasi hui kahani naa hone ke kaaran sho bikharaa hua lagane laga
 The makers of Shrenu Parikh were not able to portray the villain as a villain
 shaayad yahi vajah bani ki sho tiarapy main peeche rahaa
 It remains to be seen how true the serial offair proves

 Vijay Kumar had lived in Kaka Nagar for nearly four years with his wife Sita
 unki patni ek nijee bank main karyrat thim
 His daughter Varnya returned home from Rajasthan on Friday evening
 kaaphi der flats kaa darwaja khatkhatane par koi jawaab nahin mila, to usne pita ke sahakarmiyon ko ghatana kii jaankaree di
 Vijay Kumar's throat was cut with a sharp weapon
 lihaaja police ne katl kii dhaaraon main maamla darj kiya he
 Police came to know about the case when Vijay Kumar's 22-year-old daughter called the police from there
 shuruaati jaanch main police ne saaf kiya he ki ghar kaa darwaja andar se band tha or kisi bhi bahari shaks ke andar daakhil hone ke saboot nahin hai
 Because of this, the case seems to be homicide-suicide
 dilli ke pratishthit ilaake main do varisht sarkari logon kii maut kai sawaal ke jawaab maang rahi he
 Who cut Vijay Kumar's throat? Why and how did circumstances like suicide arise? Should it be assumed that the wife first killed the husband and then committed suicide? Or, did the first wife commit suicide and then the husband cut his throat in panic

 vitt mantri pi chidambaram kaa pitara khulne hi vaala he
 Before going to the elections, if the government tries to win the heart of the country through this budget, then the people who are badly in debt are also looking for relief
 lekin aakhir chidambaram ke saamne chunautiyaan kya hai?chunauti bajet se bangala dilaane kii
 The challenge is not to steal secretly
 chunauti tex kam ho to khush hon ham
 And the challenge is to reverse the idiom from all the places
 pehali chunauti bajet dilaaegaa banglamgar ye ghar ajeeb he, jameen ke kareeb he, ye eent pattharon kaa ghar, hamaari hasaraton kaa ghar
 Somewhere there is a treasure house of happiness, somewhere a home of dreams
 kabhi ghar main khushiyaan, kabhi khushiyon main ghar basaate hai
 For us, it is not just a house, a home for every feeling
 apana ghar har kisi kaa khwab he par saalon se adhuri imaaraton main ashiyane kaa sapana dam tod rahaa he
 Prices have risen higher than skyscrapers and buyers are waiting for finished houses
 to kya 2013 kaa bajet in ashankaon ko dur karegaa? kya ghar kaa sapana hakeekat banegaa? kya real estate ko milegi ek nai zindagi?chaahe aap ghar kharidne kaa sapana sanjon rahe hon yaa phir is saal milane vaale ghar ko sajaane kii taiyaari kar rahe hon
 There will be hope from the general budget
 yun to phizaan chunavi he
 The sugar syrup of popularity will be thick, but when the question is of moderate earning, then the expectations are also accurate
 home lone byaaj par tex chhot kii seemaa abhi 1
 5 lakhs
 maang he ki ise badhaakar 3 lakh rupee kiya jaae taaki doguni raahat dekhakar karadaata ghar kaa sapana hakeekat banane kii himmat kar saken
 This will benefit not only the buyers but also the sellers
 gharon kii keemten karodon main pahunch chuki hai or lone lakhon main par niyam abhi bhi das saal puraane
 If every guest in the house measures your status then in the scale of the drawing room
 deevaaron par kisi paint he, tivi kaa saiz or brands kya he
 How is the finish of the sofas, but like the price of the house, the prices of all these things are also on fire
 khayr ye chizein to ek ore hai, pichley do saal main gharon kii nirmaan saamagree main pachaas pratishat kii badhotaree ho chuki he
 Developers have to pay a hefty amount in the form of IDC-EDC, so they have to pay huge fees for separate and licensing and land use changes
 iskaa sidhaa asar ghar kii keemat par padaa he
 The good news is that this time the government may consider subsidizing raw material prices for affordable housing
 ye saare kadam sidhe aam aadmi ko phayda pahunchaa sakate hai
 In 2013, 5 lakh people will get the expectation from home budget
 duusari taraf he is saal banane vaala ek nayaa record
 This is the record of home entry
 2013 main saadhe chaar se 5 lakh logon ko lambey intazaar ke baad apane gharon kaa posation milegaa
 In 2012, two and a half million people got possession of houses
 5 lakh gharon kaa ye aankada 2013 ko delivery kaa abtak kaa sabase bada saal bana degaa
 Perhaps this year you will be among those 5 lakh people, who will be able to sleep in their bedroom, on their bed
 chaiyn kii neend is bistar par tabhi aegi, jab aapako aapkaa ghar vaade kii miyaad main mila ho, nahin to aapako bhi maaloom he ki isamen nafe se zyaada nuksaan he
 The truth is that most of the people who will be handed over this year were promised 7 years ago
 yun to vaada ye hota he ki 3 saal ke bheetar ghar mil jayega par graahak bas maheenon ko saalon main tabdeel hota dekhte rahete hai
 The penalty is so minor that the builder does not even care much and that is why the biggest expectation of the budget session is the real estate regulator bill to be presented in it
 ye bill is baar bajet satr main pesh hoga or iske paas hone kii bhi puri ummid he
 With the introduction of the regulator, there will be someone to control the arbitrary conditions of the developers
 unhen vakt par ghar kaa posation dena hoga
 Failure to do so will result in heavy penalty being imposed on them
 ghar samay par milane kii ummid to real estate regulator ke boote kii ja sakati he lekin gharon kii aasmaan chooti keemton ko kaabo main karne ke liye bhi bajet main kadam uthaane honge
 To dream of a house in Delhi or any metro is very expensive
 aasapaas ke ilaake main bhi agar aap ghar dhundhen to 1000 squayar feet kaa aria kaa ek tu bedroom flat aapako ausatan 50 lakh kaa milegaa
 The problem is that according to the definition, only houses worth up to 25 lakhs come under affordable housing
 jiske liye aap 15 lakh tak kaa lone lenge to byaaj dar main 1 fisadi kii chhot milegi par aisa ghar milegaa kahaan
 At least not in or around any metro city
 sarkari hakeekat kaagazi he or badhati hui shahari aabaadi ko dekhte hue ise jald se jald asaliyat main dhaalane kii zarurat he isiilie maang he ki afordable gharon kii keemat kaa dayera badhaayaa jaae
 There should be an increase in the tax exemption on these
 ise infrarestracchar states mili
 So that loans can be easily available at concessional rates
 ek taraf mahange ghar kii chintaa he
 On the other hand, this expensive dining room of that house would be expensive
 khayr, ghar to tab bharenge, jab ghar hoga
 And even when there is money left in the pocket after getting the position
 yahi vajah he ki farvari kii aakhri taarikh kaa intazaar itani shiddat se ho rahaa he

 jahaan mana ja rahaa he ki congress jeet sakati he
 In Bikaner, Jhunjhunu, Sikar and Jaipur Rural seats, it is being considered a contest between Congress and BJP
 koi bhi dal apni jeet ke prati puri tarah se aashwast nahin he
 In the city of Jaipur, both the Congress and the BJP are embroiled in an internal problem
 jis party main zyada bhitarghaat hua, us party ke jeetne kii sambhaavna kam he
 It is believed that Gurjars are angry with Sachin Pilot not being made the Chief Minister, but Sachin Pilot has celebrated angry Gurjars by organizing rallies in the area
 dhaulpur-karauli kii sabha main to sachin payalat ne kaha ki mere haath majboot karne ke liye aap congress ko vot dijie
 If Sachin Pilot is able to win in his areas of influence, he will grow in stature within the party
 udhar kaha ja rahaa he ki dhaulpur-karauli, jaipur shahar, bharatpur jaisi siton purv mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne bhi apni takat lagaai he

 On October 26, Amit Shah and JD (U) chief and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar announced that they would contest equal seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Bihar
 bhagava party kaaphi jhuk gai
 Currently, it has the largest number of Lok Sabha seats in the state
 rajya main 2014 main bhaajapa ko 40 main se 22 par jeet mili thi, jabaki akele ladgaye vaale jad (you) ko sirf do siten hasil hui thim
 a BJP leader in Patna said that the new rapport meant that the ticket of at least five of his current mps could be cut
 rajya main endie ke paas philhal 33 siten hai, jinamein ramvilas paswan kii lok janashakti party ke paas chah or upendra kushvaha kii rashtriya lok samta party ke paas teen siten hai
 According to JD (U) sources, the BJP was forced to make this announcement, as Nitish Kumar refused to participate in any alliance meeting
 haalanki, shah or nitish ne abhi kisi sankhya kaa khulaasa nahin kiya he, lekin yah mana ja rahaa he ki donon partiyaan 17-17 siton par chunaav ladengi
 In this way, only four seats will be left for LJP and only two seats for RLSP
 kushvaha to khulkar vipaksh ke saath galabahiyaan karne kii koshish karte dekhe gaye, lekin lagata he ki bhaajapa netritv ko isaki bahut parvaah nahin he
 Many BJP leaders were privately claiming that their party would contest more seats than JD (U)
 bhaajapa ke jhukne kii vajah yah maani ja rahi he ki bihar main achche parinaam ke liye bhaajapa nitish kumaar par nirbhar he
 a senior BJP leader said, "after Chandrababu Naidu is left, our central leadership no longer wants that a colleague like Nitish should be left out
 ''yakeenan bhaajapa ke liye isaki vajah bhi he
 During the four assembly and two Lok Sabha elections held between 2005 and 2015 (except for the Narendra Modi wave in 2014), the same faction was won by Nitish Kumar
 rajya ke ek varisht bhaajapa netaa ne kaha, ''2014 ke vipareet 2019 main hamen anti-inkambency or mohabhang jaise maahaul se nipatna hoga
 Therefore, to maintain the chance of victory in Bihar, we have to keep Nitish Kumar in our court
 ''vastav main, bhaajapa netaaon kaa ek varg is ranneeti ko upyukt maanata he ki bihar main endie ke loksabhaa abhiyaan kaa netritv nitish ko karne diya jaae
 a senior BJP leader in Patna said, "an alliance with Nitish Kumar in Bihar can tackle any possible anti-incumbency against the Modi government in the state
" ''jad (you) ke ek utsahit netaa kaa maananaa he ki uttar pradesh main loksabhaa upachunaavon main bhaajapa kii haar or modi lahar ke thande padate jane se bhagava party ke paas iske alaava koi vikalp nahin bachaa he ki vah nitish kumaar ke saath aage bade

 "laxman is not alone among the Indian batsmen who have failed to tour Australia
" abhi tak chah pariyon main vah sirf 102 ran bana sake hai

 a woman dies at the threshold of a Delhi court
 is fariyaad ke saath ki mujhe insaaf chahie
 What will be getting? Now she left after giving up her life
 lekin uskaa sawaal ab bhi apni jagah kaayam he
 Sitam, see that the one who has the responsibility of getting justice on his shoulders, is himself standing in the dock of Muljim
 haath bekaar kyonki gathiya ne biimaar kiya
 The questions of the khaki uniform in the house got irritated
 thane main kanoon ne aabru taar-taar kiya
 And outside the house, the khaki uniform made life difficult
 bas isiilie koi or jagah nahin mili to isane kanoon kii choukhat par hi khud kii kahani khatm kar lee
 With this last wish on the basis of fine justice
 mujhe insaaf chahie
 What will be found? a video of the black reality of Delhi Police has surfaced
 jisamen dilli police kaa ek ispector jo ki dilli police ke ek thane kaa esechao yani maalik bhi he ek cese ke silsile main ek mahila se poochtacha kar rahaa he
 Yes yes ek mahila se ek purush inspector ne ye tamaam sawaal puche
 By keeping all the sections of the IPC-CRPC, the Dictionary of Law, in your pocket
 ye to khud us inspector kii apni hi karatuut video kii shakl main saamne aa gai to hamen or aapako pataa bhi chal gaya
 We do not know how this woman spent the entire ten months out of this video
 par haa jis tarah se isane dilli kii tees hajaari adaalat kii choukhat par jaakar apni jaan di usase itnaa to andaja laga hi sakate hai ki dilli police ke is inspector kii darindagi jhel kar jeene se kahin zyada aasaan ise maranaa laga
 On April 30, Rekha gave her life, then this story came to light on April 30, when Rekha gave her life by consuming poison at the threshold of Tis Hazari court in Delhi
 magar is kahani kii shuruyaat usase bhi das maheene pehle ho chuki thi
 Kahani stroked the uniform of an inspector
 kahani ek inspector kaa khud ko kanoon se bada maanane kii or kahani ek aurat se ek police afasar kii aisi ghatiya poochtacha kii ki wo marane ko majaboor ho gai
 On April 30, there was a sudden scuffle near Gate number two of Tis Hazari Court in Delhi
 darasal ek ladki gash kha kar gir padi thi
 Foam was coming out of his mouth
 fouran logon kii madad se police ne use paas ke hi aruna asaf ali aspataal le gai
 But by then she was dead
 usne jehar kha liya tha
 a suicide note was found from the girl's bag
 bas isi suicide note ke saamne aate hi ab tamaam nigahen vijay vihaar thane ke esechao dinesh kumaar kii taraf uth gai hai
 Inspector Dinesh Kumar was also arrested within 24 hours
 phir shuruaati tafteesh ke baad agle 48 ghante ke andar hi use naukari se bhi barkhaast kar diya gaya
 But the real face of Inspector Dinesh Kumar was yet to be revealed
 darasalkhudakushikarne se pehle yani 30 april ko rekha urf tanu naam kii ye mahila jiskaa ek haath gathiya kii beemaari kii vajah se kaam nahin kar rahaa tha, tees hazari court ek vakil se milane gai thi
 To file a complaint against Inspector Dinesh Kumar
 us shikaayat ko wo adaalat ke saath-saath raashtrapati se lekar pradhanmantri tak bhejnaa chaahati thi
 But she was disappointed to hear the lawyer's reply
 isi ke baad usne adaalat kii choukhat par hi jehar kha kar jaan de di
 Before the report was written, before Rekha died, Rekha wrote the josuside notices to the police
 jaanch main pataa chalaa ki rekha isse pehle bhi police main report likhaa chuki thi
 At the same time, during the investigation, police also found the video shot in the hand of police inspector Danesh Kumar, which he himself shot during interrogation
 iske baad inspector dinesh kumaar phir rekha ke paas pahunchaa
 Questioned him again
 or phir sab kuch record kiya
 For ten months, the inspector was constantly harassing Rekha
 yahaan tak ki use kai baar torchar bhi kiya
 And that's why Rekha gave her life
 mahila ko thane bulaakar nahin kar sakate poochtachakanoon saaf-saaf kahata he ki kisi mahila ko thane bula kar poochtacha nahin kar sakate
 Nor can a woman be questioned after six in the evening
 magar rekha ke maamle main dilli police ne saare kanoon taak par rakh die
 In a city like Delhi, an inspector openly sneaks into a house anytime and day
 ghar waalon ko dhamkata he
 Creates false cases
 purush hokar akele mahilaon se poochtacha karata he
 That too in a vulgar way
 or ye sab kuch tab jabaki baqayada kanoon ye kahata he ki mahila se poochtacha bina mahila police afasar kii maujuudagi ke nahin hona chahie
 Section 160 of the crpc ie Criminal Procedure Act is for this purpose
 inspector dinesh kamaar sirf rekha ke ghar main hi nahin balki ilaake ke bahut se or logon ko bhi dhamkata rahata tha
 Now it is to be seen that the justice who could not get the justice, won, will he get it after he dies? After the arrest, Inspector Dinesh Kumar also got bail on Monday
