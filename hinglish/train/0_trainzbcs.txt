 Premium charges apply !! On Sunday, Iraq declared an army victory over Mosul
 iraqi sarkaar ne bataaya ki mosul se aatanki sanghathan ISIS kaa khaatmaa kiya ja chukaa he
 The Iraqi army hoisted its flag in Mosul in joy of victory
 mosul ko to iesas aatankiyon se aazaadee mil gai
 But the Indians who were tied up by ISIS terrorists, there is no news at the moment
 mosul par ISIS ke kabje ke baad june 2014 39 bhartiya mazdooron ko bandhan banane kii khabar ai
 Meanwhile Harjit Singh succeeded in getting out of the clutches of ISIS
 bharat aakar harjit messiah ne daawa kiya tha ki sabhi 39 bhartiya mazdooron kii goli markar hatya kar di gai he
 Even though the Foreign Ministry claimed to be alive, Harjit Singh had spoken of the death of the hostage Indian laborers, but the Ministry of External Affairs has been claiming to be alive
 haal hi main videsh mantralay ne bataaya tha bandhak banaae gaye sabhi bhartiya surakshit hai, unhen koi nuksaan nahin pahunchaa he
 The Foreign Ministry had also told that no demand has been made in lieu of the release of the hostages
 isse pehle sansad main videsh rajya mantri wike singh ne sabhi bandhak bharatiyon ke surakshati hone kii soochna di thi
 He had said that the government is taking all steps for the safe release of the hostages
 wike singh jaaenge iraqis bich somvaar shaam videsh mantralay ne bataaya ki videsh rajya mantri wike singh irbil jaaenge
 The Foreign Ministry expressed happiness over the independence of Mosul from ISIS and welcomed victory in the fight against terror
 mantralay ne ye bhi bataaya ki mosul par iraqi sena kii jeet ke saath hi bharat sarkaar ne 39 bandhak bharatiyon kii khoj ke liye har mumkin koshish shuru kar di he
 'clean sweep' of ISIS from Mosul, Iraqi army hoists flag
 The PM did not make any statement
 However, on Sunday, Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-abdi reached Mosul and congratulated the army for the victory
 magar is dauraan abdi ne jeet par desh ko sambodhit nahin kiya
 Nor was any information given to the Iraqi government and the military regarding the Indian hostages
 aise main bada sawaal ye he ki jab mosul se aatankiyon kaa safaya ho chukaa he or 39 bhartiya majdoor ISIS aatankiyon ke changul main the, tab bhartiya majdoor kahaan hai? Nobel Prize-awarded economist Amartya Sen has said that government interference in academic affairs during the Modi government has become 'exceptionally common thing' and often 'politically excessive'
 baharhaal, unhone kaha ki yah koi pehla mauka nahin he, jab kisi sarkaar ne academik maamalon main apane vichaaron se hastkshep kiya ho, kyonki pichhali upie sarkaar kii gaiyr-dakhsandaji bhi 'trutiheenta se kaaphi dur' thi
 Sen wrote in his new book, 'the Country of First Boy', but interference under the current government has become extraordinarily common and often politically excessive

 unhone kaha ki modi ne unhen or pankaj ko kabhi nahin bulaayaa
 Neither his son took bribe nor did the PM reprimand him

 Pankaj Singh's claim from Noida seat was considered to be the strongest in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly by-election to be held on 13 September
 lekin party ne is seat par vimala batham ko tikat dene kaa elaan kiya
 Even during the Lok Sabha elections, there was a possibility of giving ticket to Pankaj Singh after Rajnath vacated Ghaziabad seat, but it did not happen
 2012 ke upi vidhansabha chunaav main pankaj singh ko banaras kshetra kii ek seat se tikat mila
 However, he himself returned the ticket after heavy opposition
 pankaj singh ke virodh kaa kaaravaan sirf chunavi tikat tak simit nahin rahaa
 When he was appointed as the state president of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, it was strongly opposed even at that time

 rajyasabha sadsy ke rup main unka kaarykaal is varsh 14 june ko samaapt ho gaya

 Secondly, for irrigation projects, land will be given in lieu of land or cash compensation or both will not be given as provided in the new bill

 According to information received by NDTV, now the amendments in the irrigation schemes from the old date will not be applicable

 With the new government coming to the center, dismissing the trend of changing the governors, the Supreme Court today said that the governors of the state cannot be changed arbitrarily
 pradhan nyaayadhish keji baalkrishnan kii adhyakshata main paanch nyaayadhishon vaali sanvaidhanik peeth ne vyavastha di ki kisi rajyapal ko sirf ‚Äòbadhyakaari‚Äô kaarnon se hi badla ja saktaa he or vah bhi tab jab ki unke khilaaf duracharan yaa aniyimitata kaa maamla sabit ho chukaa ho
 The apex court said that the Governor is appointed by the President and therefore cannot be removed only on the basis that he is not 'in conformity' with the party in power
 peeth ne kaha ki rajyapal ko sirf ‚Äòbadhyakaari kaarnon‚Äô se hi hataaya ja saktaa he or badhyakaari kaaran kisi khaas maamle ke tathyon or sthitiyon par nirbhar karte hai
 During the arguments in the court, the Center had said that if the Governor's stance does not match with the national policy, it can be removed by cutting the tenure of five years
 centre ne kaha ki rajyapalon kaa kaam centre or rajya sarkaron ke bich sethu ke rup main hota he or is tarah ve khud sarkaar ke vichaaron se asahmat nahin ho sakate
 He argued that if a party comes to power under a mandate with a particular socio-economic agenda, the governor cannot say that they do not agree with it
 peeth main nyaayamurti esech kapaadiya aarvi rabindran bi sudarshan reddy or pi sadashivam shaamil the jinhone is mudde par sarvasammat faisla diya
 This important decision came on a PIL filed by BJP MP BP Singhal in 2004 in which he challenged the removal of the governors of Uttar Pradesh Gujarat Haryana and Orissa by the previous UPA government
 janhit yachika main tark diya gaya ki sanvaidhanik praavdhaan kii andekhi kar kendra kii salaah par raashtrapati chaar rajyon ke un rajyapalon ko nahin hataa sakate the

 haalanki homosexual logon ko saream maut dene kaa ye koi pehla maamla nahin he
 Even before this, many ISIS terrorists have taken them to the high buildings of the city and pushed them down from the top
 lekin is baar jis tarah se mike par munaadi kar logon ko bulaane ke baad talwaar ke zarie teen logon ke sir kaate gaye hai

 In many a debate on TV channels, shared thoughts with him
 Condolences to his family and his fraternity
 - Nirmala Sitharaman (@nsitharaman) February 26, 2018 TSR Subramanian was a 1961 cadre batch member from Uttar Pradesh
 vah 1 agast 1996 se 1 march 1998 tak cabinet sachiv rahe the
 Apart from this, he had also held the post of Secretary in the Ministry of Textiles

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bahuprachaarit swatchta abhiyaan ke saath hi saaf-safai kii maujuuda sthiti, jarurat or paribhaashaon par charchaaen shuru ho gai hai
 The Prime Minister himself led this campaign by sweeping the Valmiki colony of historic importance in Delhi
 mukhtaliff mahakamon ke mantri or netaa bhi jhaadu liye saarvajanik jagahon par safai kaa naaraa buland kar rahe hai
 With a budget of about 60 thousand crores, it is being talked about to make the country dirt free and toilets available to every citizen
 japan or america ke smart shaharon kaa sapana bhartiya madhyavarg kii ankhon main utar aayaa he
 The camera flashes are flashing
 lekin kya yah abhiyaan vaaki waisi safai karegaa, jisaki jarurat bharat ko he? kya sadakon kii safai hi asal safai he? agar sarkaar nagarikon main apane aas-paas ko saaf rakhane kii ek samuhik chetana ko ropana chaahati he, to isamen bura kya he? paryaavaran ke najariye se yah swatchta abhiyaan koi vishesh ahmiyat rakhata he yaa nahin? yaa gandagi mukt bharat 'garibi mukt bharat' jaisaa hi ek bina expyri date vaala sapana he? tamaam simaaon ke baavjood ise ek jaruri pahal maanane main harj hi kya he? ye saare sawaal tab or bhi maujuun ho jate hai, jab ham is tathy se bhi anjaan hai ki hamaare desh main kul kitna mailaa pani paidaa hota he
 Embarrassment is the foundation of this campaign? Sopan Joshi is a long-standing journalist in the field of environment
 bharat main sanitessan kii sthiti par unki kitaab 'jal, thal or mel' kuch maheenon main relies hone vaali he
 His approach to cleanliness and seeing this cleanliness campaign is based on facts and is very interesting
 vah is abhiyaan ke mul main gandagi ke prati sharmindagi kaa bhav dekhte hai or shuruaati str par ise 'lipa-potee' hi zyada maanate hai
 According to him, 'a person in the village feels ashamed to go to his rich relative in the city, it is like that
 sadak par chalate hue gandagi nahin dikhni chahie, varanaa beijjati ho jaaegi
 That is to say, feeling dirty is bad
 isamen apane logon kaa haal-chaal jaanane kii bhaavana nahin he
 'sopan says that on an immediate basis he finds it more a' lipa granddaughter 'of a kind of campaign
 vah kehete hai, 'sirf bijepi kii baat nahin he
 The daub has come in the form of government
 darasal saarvajanik jagahon ko hamane apana maananaa band kar diya he
 There is no such tendency to think of themselves as society
 is abhiyaan se kuch hasil ho jaae to bahut acchhee baat he
 But that will be considered when proven
 svachh bharat banaaenge, aisa kehane se bharat svachh nahin hoga
 The practice of manual scavenging has not ended in Gujarat nor in the country
 jin logon ko is disha main kaam karnaa tha, unhone kisi abhiyaan kaa intjaar nahin kiya
 'sopan Joshi' also develops' Gangsopan says that the Congress government passed the law to abolish manual scavenging in 1993
 pichley saal phir aisa ek kanoon paarit kiya
 His question is how many laws are needed to end this practice? After winning the Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi gave a speech to Vadodara saying that there is only one solution to every problem, 'growth, development and development'
 yah gandagi jo aap dekhte hai or jo nahin dekhte hai, vah vikaas kii paidaa kii hui gandagi he
 Now the situation is that the more polluting the river, the more developed it is
 'shauchalay badhenge to nadiyaan tabah ho jaaengi'narendra modi pradhanmantri banane se pehle hi 'devalayon se pehle shauchalay' banane kii baat kah chuke hai
 Under the cleanliness campaign, a huge amount will be spent to build pucca toilets
 iskaa vistaar desh ke har naagarik ke liye shauchalay uplabdh karaane tak jaataa he
 But in Sopan's opinion, if this happens, the pollution of the country's rivers will reach dangerous levels
 ham kitna vah bataate hai ki maile pani ke nikaas ke str par hamaare intjaam kitne charraye hue hai
 It is unfortunate that we have no idea how much dirty water we produce
 vah bataate hai ki saal 1999 main endie sarkaar ne pehali baar aisa survey karaayaa tha
 Out of 300 cities, only 100 cities were found to have any type of (running or bad) sewer system
 ICRER sanstha ne 2011 main ek report di, jiske mutabik hamaare 5161 chote-bade shaharon main se sirf 300 main kisi tarah kaa siver system he
 Less than half of the homes in Bengaluru and Hyderabad, called IT hubs, are connected to sewer systems
 zyada shauchalay bichaane kaa makasad he, siver kii naaliyaan bichaana
 The poor arrangement to clean the dirty water is the purpose of laying the drain of the sewer, then finally the sewage treatment plant
 2005 ke aakhri aadhikarik anqade ke mutabik hamaare lagbhag 500 shaharon main 3825 karod litre mailaa pani roj paidaa hota he
 In total at that time (in 2011) there were 231 sewage plants and 38 were being built
 agar ye saare plant apni adhiktam kshamta se kaam karen to har roj 1178 karod litre mailaa pani saaf karenge
 That is, our installed capacity is not even a third of our needs
 kul santhaapit kshamta kaa kareeb 45 fisadi sirf dilli or mumbai main he
 Yamuna's condition in Delhi is not hidden from anyone
 ab samajhie ki yah haalat tab he, jab desh ke aadhe se zyada logon ke paas shauchalay nahin he
 Guess what will happen if toilets are built
 sopan kehete hai ki shauchalay banane main samasya nahin he
 The simplest task for the government is to build small brick walls and roofs
 lekin maile pani ke nikaas ke bina ye shauchalay mushkil hi badhaane vaale hai
 According to him, 'this will happen when you face the problem, not run away from it
 gandhi ji ke raste main kisi ne mel tyaag kar diya tha
 But he did not suffer from the maliciousness of his smell
 unhen sharmindagi nahin thi
 Therefore, he himself reached with a broom
 bijepi or congress donon kaa hi ek-sa haal he
 Either party had been in power, their way of working remained the same
 isamen antar modi ji laa paaenge yaa nahin, yah to aage chalakar hi pataa lagegaa
 Sopan Joshi has been the editor of environmental magazine 'down to Earth'
 patrakarita kaa kareeb 18 saal kaa anubhav he
 Now Gandhi is a research fellow at the peace establishment

 Let us know what these sectors expect from the general budget and how it can affect the common man's pocket
 1- emmemasiji sectormasiji aisa sector he, jiskaa sabase zyada asar aam logon kii rosemara kii jindagi par padataa he

 Mulayam Singh's disproportionate assets case came to light in November 2005 when Rae Bareilly resident lawyer and Congress worker Vishwanath Chaturvedi filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court on the property of Mulayam, his sons Akhilesh Yadav and Prateek Yadav and daughter-in-law Dimple Yadav
 Demanded a CBI inquiry
 yachika par sunwaayee ke baad june 2006 main supreme court ne mulaayam singh, akhilesh yadav, pratik yadav or dimple ko beete chaar varsh ke dauraan file kiye gaye ‚Äò‚Äòinakam tex ritern‚Äô‚Äô ko prastut karne kaa aadesh diya
 In March 2007, the Supreme Court asked the CBI to submit a preliminary inquiry on all allegations and submit a report
 sibiai ne is maamle main apni praathmik jaanch (2e / 2007 / sibiai / asiu-4) main mulaayam singh or unke parivaar ke ‚Äò‚Äòinakam tex‚Äô‚Äô or ‚Äò‚Äòvelth tex ritern‚Äô‚Äô, sampatti ke kagajaat or bank account samet kul 350 dastavej jutaaye or aath laagon se poochtacha kii
 From April 1, 1993 to March 31, 2005, the CBI investigated the movable and immovable property of Mulayam and his family
 isamen sibiai ne paaya tha ki mulaayam or unke parivaar ne aay ke gyaat sroton se adhik 2
 63 crore was earned
 report main sibiai ne mulaayam singh yadav or akhilesh par bhrashtachar kaa mukadmaa darj karne kii maang kii
 The round of political bargaining began to tighten the grip on the clan, and Mulayam's first surrender was shown in saving the Manmohan government from America in the nuclear deal
 usee vakt (march 2008) sibiai ne supreme court main aavedan dekar mulaayam or unke parivaar ke sadasyon par aay se adhik sampatti jutaney ke maamle main maamla darj karne kii anumati maangi
 This was the time when the Left Front, which had 59 mps on the nuclear deal, withdrew its support from the UPA government
 tab mulaayam ne achaanak rukh badla or purv raashtrapati apije abdul kalam kii raay ko dhaal banaakar upie sarkaar ko bachaaya
 a total of 39 SP mps then supported the government and played a major role in securing the trust of the government on 22 July 2008 within the Parliament
 july 2008 main hi dimple yadav ne pradhanmantri ko ek patr likhakar apane upar lage aaropon ko niraadhaar bataaya to piem ne us patr ko kanoonee salaah ke liye bhej diya
 However, recently, Mulayam has called it his "big mistake"
 sibiai kii kabhi haa, kabhi navishwaas mat ke kuch dinon baad november 2008 main hi tatkaaleen solicytor general ji
 E
 vaahnavati ne apni report sarkaar ko saunp kar salaah di ki dimple yadav or mulaayam kii divangat patni malti devi kii sampatti ko saath nahin jodpha chahie kyonki ye donon lok sevak nahin hai
 He mistaken Mulayam's calculation of wealth
 iske baad sibiai ne 6 disambar, 2008 main mulaayam singh or unke parivaar ke khilaaf vistrut jaanch karne kii maang ko waapas lene ke liye supreme court main aavedan diya
 In this, the CBI said that it is doing this on the advice of the central government
 lekin jab 2009 main congress or sapa ke bich chunavi gathjod nahin hua to march 2009 ko sibiai ne you-turn lete hue supreme court se mulaayam par mukadmaa darj karne kii anumati maangi
 The Supreme Court reserved its decision on the cbi's plea
 lekin 13 disambar, 2012 ko court ne sibiai se mulaayam singh or unke putron ke khilaaf jaanch jari rakhane ko kaha
 Dimple Yadav was relieved in this
 mushkil hoga sibiai kaa you-turnaupie sarkaar is monsoon satr main apane mahatvakankshi khaadya suraksha bill ko sansad main paarit karwaane ke liye sapa ke sahyog kii jarurat padane kii sambhaavna ke maddenjar sibiai kii ore se nau saal se mulaayam ke gale kii haddi bane aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main supreme court main closer report daakhil karne kii soch rahi he, to yadav parivaar bhi chuppi kii siyasat karnaa chahta he
 Chaturvedi, who has pleaded the case against Mulayam, even goes on to say that if the CBI tries to save Mulayam Singh, he will present documents of bargaining between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Mulayam in the Supreme Court
 supreme court ke vakil viraag gupta kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòupie ke astitv kii jarurat ban chuke mulaayam ko sibiai takneekee laabh dekar bachaana chaahati he
 It is clear that the CBI investigation is affected by the power equations
 ‚Äô‚Äôhaalanki sibiai aisi kisi pahal se inkaar kar rahi he, lekin mulaayam singh bemausam pradhanmantri manmohan singh se mil aae to sanket yahi mili
 This entire case is a perfect example of questioning the intent of the CBI
 sibiai ne apni report main chote putr pratik se judi mulaayam kii nijee jindagi main taank-jhaank karne kii bhi koshish kii he, isliye dhartiputra is jaanch se jald pind chhudaana chaahate hai
 But why is CBI suddenly taking a U-turn? Joginder Singh, the former director of the agency, answers this, "it will be what the government wants
" sibiai to har taraf se bandhi he
 There should be permission from the government at every level
 use vakil to vahi milte hai, jo sarkaar detii he
 Advocates will say in court that if CBI should close the case, what will the CBI do? ‚Äùit has also been shown earlier that on 13 June last year, Mulayam Singh Yadav, along with Trinamool Congress leader Mamta, suddenly held the post for the post of national elections
 The name of the first choice of the Congress was Pranab Mukherjee and the second choice was Hamid Ansari
 unhone apni pasand ke taur par purv raashtrapati e
 P
 je
 Abdul Kalam's name was tossed
 lekin ve apane rukh par 24 ghante bhi kaayam nahin rahe
 The very next day, leaving Mamata Banerjee alone, he sat in the lap of Congress
 26 farvari, 2010 ke aam bajet main tatkaaleen vitt mantri pranab mukherjee ne petrol-dijal main exise duty badhaane kaa elaan kiya, to mulaayam samet samoochaa vipaksh ekajute ho gaya
 After opposition solidarity was announced to bring Shkat Motion (deduction proposal), on the day of the proposal, on 27 April, Mulayam Singh helped the government to bring down the opposition's cut proposal by walkout from Lok Sabha
 mulaayam ne vakout se pehle sadan main kisaan, garib or berozegaron ke liye anudaan kii maang rakhi thi, lekin dabaav banane ke bajaae ve maidan chhod gaye
 Apart from this, Mulayam had given defense cover to the government on the issue of setting up a Joint Parliamentary Investigation Committee (JPC) in the 2G spectrum
 itnaa hi nahin, jepisi report ko khaarij karne ke liye vipakshi ekajutata shuru hui to sapa par phir sarkaar kaa dabaav badha
 SP state spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said on 16 December last year that the central government was showing fear of CBI to the SP supremo due to opposing FDI and quota in promotion
 jaahir he ki congress ne sarkaar bachaane ke liye mulaayam ko mohara banaaya, to upie- 1 main dutkaare jane ke baad bhi akhaade ke is pahalwaan ne apane upar latak rahi sibiai kii talwaar ko myaan main dalwane kii bharsak koshishen kii
 -with Piyush Babelle supreme court ne 1993 ke dilli blast maamle ke doshi devender paal singh bhullar kii faansee ko umrakaid main tabdeel karne vaali yachika par centre ko notice bheja he
 Bhullar has filed this petition on the basis of the delay in deciding the petition and mental health of the President to waive his death sentence
 supreme court ke chif justise pi satsivam kii peeth ne bhullar kii faansee kii sajaa par roak laga di he
 The court has asked the Delhi-based Institute of Human Behavior and Allied Science to conduct an examination of Bhullar and submit a report of his condition within a week
 notice dilli sarkaar ko bhi bheja gaya he
 The matter will be heard in the court on 19 February
 june 2013 main kedarnath main ai aapadaa or pichley paanch saal main punarnirmaan ke safar ko 'aaj tak' ke dipti editor manjit singh negi ne 'kedarnath se saakshaatkaar' naamak kitaab kaa rup diya he
 a copy of this book was presented to Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Kedarnath on Diwali
 piem modi ne "kedarnath se saakshaatkaar" kitaab likhane ke liye lekhak ko badhai di jisamen aapadaa se punarnirmaan kaa sajiv chithran kiya gaya he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the book's greeting message has described it as a readable compilation of Jeevat journalism
 kitaab ke bare main jane-maane lekhak amish treepathi ne kaha he ki ve sachche shiv bhakt hai or logon ko yah kitaab jarur padhani chahie
 Noted filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar has also given his reaction about the book
 isse pehle 8 oktober ko uttarakhand inwestors summit main desh ke grahamantri rajnath singh or uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ne "kedarnath se saakshaatkaar" kaa vimochan kiya tha
 The catastrophic flood that occurred in Kedarnath five years ago is a never forgettable event
 prakruti kii is vinashlila or uske baad kedaar ghati ko uskaa divya or bhavy swaroop lautaane ke liye chale prayaas ko dekhne or cover karne ke anubhavon ko manajit negi ne ''kedarnath se saakshaatkaar'' ke rup main sankalit kiya he
 Being a TV journalist, he covered this disaster and he has visited Kedarnath many times during the disaster and reconstruction in the last five years
 lekhak ko yah kitaab likhane main 5 saal lage kyonki tivi patrakarita kii bhaagambhag kai adchane paidaa karti rahi lekin dimag main yah khyal hameshaa kaundhta rahaa ki kudarti tandav kii us vinashlila ko kisi bhi surat main kalambaddh karnaa he
 The result of the same effort is that the story of reconstruction after the disaster in the Kedarnath Valley is in the hands of the people today as an "interview with Kedarnath"
 kedarnath main punarnirmaan ke kaam ko safal banane main karnal ajay kothial or unki team kaa ahm yogadan rahaa he
 His team continued to rebuild here every season
 saath hi sarkaar ne bhi apni ore se koi kor kasar nahin chodi jisase ki punarnirmaan kaa kaam ab samaapti kii ore he
 Reconstruction is being done in Kedarnath amidst weather difficulties including snowfall
 karnal ajay kothial or unki team kedarnath main ise antim rup de rahi he
 Prime Minister Modi wants to complete the Kedarnath reconstruction before the 2019 elections, which is why he has closely monitored it
 mana ja rahaa he ki piem modi 2019 ke aam chunaav kaa shankhanaad kedranath se karnaa chaahate hai

 dilli ke uttam nagar ilaake ke shiv vihaar main somvaar shaam ek 20 saal ke yuvak kii agyaat badmaashon ne berahami se hatya kar di
 The deceased was named Sushant Lakra
 badmaashon lathi, danda, lohe ke sue or pattharon se peet-peet kar uski hatya karne ke baad faraar ho gaye
 The police is investigating the matter by registering a case
 jaankaree ke mutabik, pashchimi dilli ke uttam nagar ilaake ke shiv vihaar main sushant lakada kii badmaashon ne milakar hathya kar di
 Sushant Lakra lived with his family in Ranhola village
 uske parivaar main uski maa or choti bahan he
 The father has already died
 vah ghar kaa iklauta kamaane vaala tha
 On Monday, Sushant's friends came to call him by bike after the victim's family believed
 kuch der baad vah apni centro car se ranhola shiv vihaar pahunchaa tha
 The attackers already waiting there attacked him
 lathi, dandon or pattharon se uski jamkar pitayee kar di
 Passers-by reported the incident to the police
 maukey par pahunchi police ne lahooluhaan sushant ko turant aspataal pahunchaaya, lekin sushant ne dam tod diya
 Sushant's friends, who went along at the time of the incident, left their bikes and ran away from the spot

 aapane skulon main baccho ko praathmik gyaan pate jarur dekha hoga, jisamen shikshak bacchon ko 'k' se kabutar, 'kha' se khargosh padhaate dikh jaaenge
 But have you ever thought that any day will come in independent India where children will be openly taught to break the social fabric
 aaie ham aapako rou-ba-rou karaate hai ek aisi hi kadavi sachai se, jo in dinon jharkhand ke gramin ilaakon ke bacchon ko di ja rahi he
 'A' to law, 'B' to mineral 'A' to law, 'B' to mineral wealth tribals, 'C' gram sabha - which is paramount, organ - organ is a conservative system
 chaukiye mat yah shiksha bacchon ko baqayada skool chalaakar di ja rahi he
 These courses have been issued by the orthodox Gram Sabha of Udburu village in Murhu area of khunti district for the education of their children
 is paathyakram main desh ke pratham pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru tak ke khilaaf amaryadit tippanee kii gai he
 Some castes have also been called foreigners, calling them Daiku
 khule main chal rahe is skool ke thik saamne sarkari skool he, jahaan sirf do bachche niyamit paathyakram pard rahe hai
 In fact, children are being taught in Jharkhand in such a way that the same things come to their mind that the gram sabha says
 paathyakram main bataaya gaya he- 'k' se kanoon
 Its explanation is - the tribals have their own law
 'kha' se khanij yani khanij sampada adivaasiyon kii he
 Gram Sabha School is running in the villages of fleet, Pansakam, Hanjed, in Chamdi, Barabanda, Bhandra, Kudatoli, Siladon Panchayat, Samtaranchike Bundu Block in Khunti district
 inamen gramsabha dwaara chaynit shikshak padhaate hai
 The logic behind this is also peculiar
 ilaake ke gramin joseph purti kaa kahana he ki ham adivaasiyon kii vyavastha ke tahat apni shiksha baccho ko de rahe hai
 At the same time, the district education officer of Khunti says that what is happening is definitely not good
 kaha jaataa he ki agar kisi bhi samaaj ke saamaajik or aarthik tanebane ko tahas nahas karnaa ho to bacchon kii shiksha ko bigaad do
 All this is being done under the guise of Gram Sabha
 darasal gram sabha ek puraani vyavastha thi jise graminon ke haq main faisle lene kaa adhikaar tha
 But in democracy, by bringing it back again, it is very important to stop the poison that is being spread in the soft brain of children
 abbaas ne moinuddaula toornament ke 90 or 40 overon ke praaroop ko bhi dilachasp qaraar diya
 He said, 'for the first time i heard about the tournament of 90 and 40 overs

 ' If you go to the parlor, you will know very well what happens by getting bleach
 aajkal bazaar main kai aisi bleech kriim maujuud hai jinhen istemaal karnaa behad aasaan he
 In such a situation, people have started bleaching at home
 bleech karne se anachaahe bal twachaa ke rang ke ho jate hai or twachaa ekasaar ho jaati he
 Oxy bleach or aloe vera bleach also nourishes the skin, but a small mistake made during bleaching can also be overwhelming
 aise main yah bahut jaruri he ki aap agar ghar par bleech kaa istemaal karte hai to saavdhaanee baraten or apni twachaa ke anusaar hi bleech kaa chayan karen
 1
 agar aap pehali baar bleech kaa istemaal karne ja rahe hai to ise sidhe chehre par lagane ke bajaay haath par lagaakar ptch test kar len
 If you are not jealous, it means that bleach is good for your skin
 par agar jalan ho rahi ho to bhuulakar bhi use chehre par na lagaaein
 2
 bleech ko ankhon ke bahut kareeb, ibro or honton par nahin lagaana chahie
 But even if you accidentally hit these places while applying, clean it immediately
 3
 Whenever you buy bleach, buy only a good company
 aajkal har skin tip ke liye bleech maujuud he
 In such a situation, when buying bleach, please check its quality and expiry date
 4
 The skin should be wiped with a light wet cloth only after the bleach is thoroughly removed
 jab bleech achche se saaf ho jaae, to kisi badhiya moishcharizer se massage karnaa chahie

 loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh ke maamle main ek bada pech fansata najar aa rahaa he
 Till now the Congress was getting upset for this post, but now the Modi government is also facing difficulties without opposition
 khud sarkaar ke mantralay puch rahe hai ki aakhir netaa vipaksh he koun?darasal, 8 july, 2014 ko modi ke afasaron ne kanoon mantralay se poocha ki aakhir vipaksh kaa netaa koun he? iskaa jabaav philhal kisi ke paas nahin he
 Without the Leader of the Opposition, many big constitutional posts will soon be vacant, which will cause many problems
 sansad ke baahar or sansad ke bheetar vipaksh ke netaa pad ko lekar congress or bijepi kii jor-aajamaaish philhal khatm hoti nahin dikh rahi he
 If the BJP is citing the rules of the Constitution, then the Congress does not want to leave any stone unturned to gain the status of the opposition
 congress or bijepi ke takaraav kaa ant kahaan hoga, yah to kisi ko nahin pataa, lekin netaa vipaksh ke mudde par modi sarkaar ke mantralayon main jang jarur chhid gai he
 The Personnel Ministry under the Prime Minister asked the Law Ministry the name of the Leader of the Opposition
 carmik mantralay ne tamaam bade sanvaidhanik padon kii niyukti ke masale par netaa vipaksh kii sahmati ko jaruri qaraar diya
 The ministry also asked that the name of the Leader of the Opposition in the current Lok Sabha has not been decided yet, so it should be made clear who the Leader of the Opposition should be considered
 kya sabase bade virdohi dal se netaa vipaksh hona chahie yaa phir vipakshi dalon ke sabase bade samooh ke netaa ko yah darja diya jaae?darasal, carmik mantralay ko is baat kii chintaa he ki aane vaale samay main kai bade santhaan or vibhaagon ke prumakh ritair ho rahe hai or nae pramukhon kii niyukti main kahin koi sanvaidhanik sankat na khadaa ho jaae
 The difficulty is that no one can be placed in these positions without the consent of the Leader of the Opposition
 misaal ke taur par:1
 Chief Information Commissioner Rajiv Mathur is retiring in the next month i
e
 August 2014
 nae pramukh ke liye netaa vipaksh kii sahmati jaruri he
 2
 chif visilence kamishnar pradeep kumaar sitambar, 2014 main ritair ho rahe hai
 3
 sibiai ke diarector ranjit sinha bhi november, 2014 main ritair ho rahe hai
 According to the Lokpal Act, now the consent of the Leader of the Opposition is also necessary for the appointment of the CBI chief
 4
 Similarly, National Human Rights Commission Chairman KG Balakrishna is retiring next year
 ab unki jagah par nae adhyaksh banane main netaa vipaksh kii rajamandi jaruri he
 At present, the officials of the Ministry of Personnel under the Prime Minister are worried about how to decide the name of the new director of CBI or CVC in the coming months
 darasal sabase pehle jab afasaron ne loksabhaa sachivalay se netaa vipaksh ke mudde par tasviir saaf karne kii koshish kii, to loksabhaa ne saaf taur par yah kah diya ki abhi tak netaa vipaksh kaa masalaa tay nahin ho paaya he
 After this, the same question was written to the Law Ministry by the officers
 sach to yah he ki in sawaalon ko lekar pehle loksabhaa sachivalay ulajhaa or ab kanoon mantralay ulajh gaya he

 Pakistan is like a person who has created an arm or an army but has ignored education on the other side
 natijatan, yahaan kaa shiksha tantra puri tarah bikhar chukaa he or aarthik rup se bhi bahut peeche chhot chukaa he
 Menon referred to the advice of Chinese President Jiang Zhemin during his 1996 visit to Islamabad
 unhone pakistan ko salaah di ki vah bharat ke saath vahi kare jo china ne kiya heru matbhedon par baat kare lekin rishte ko badaae de
 This Chinese advice can be very effective for both sides

 It is considered inauspicious to keep a dry basil plant in the house
 paudha suukh gaya he to use kisi pavitra nadi, talab yaa kisi kune main pravaahit kar den
 Immediately after removing the dried plant, plant a new basil plant

 Delhi BJP MLA OP Sharma has once surrounded Muslims
 is baar maamla supreme court se judaa he, jisamen court ne unke khilaaf avmaananaa kaa notice de diya he
 Actually, the case is related to sealing
 6 farvari ko montering cameti ceiling drive chalaa rahi thi
 It is alleged that the BJP MLA tried to stop it during the sealing drive
 iske baad sarkari kaam main baadha utpann karne ke aarope main monitering cameti ne bijepi vidhayak ke khilaaf exiaar darj karne ko kaha tha

 OP Sharma, who arrived in East Delhi on February 6 to stop the sealing, says that the merchant who was sealing has deposited the conversion charge
 uske baavjood bhi ceiling kii ja rahi he
 However, according to sources, the road on which the sealing action was taking place has not been notified
 iskaa matlab ye hua ki agar vyapaaree ne canvarjan charge jamaa kar diya phir bhi uski ceiling hogi, kyonki ye kanoonee rup se galat he
 After the sealing action, many traders had submitted the conversion charge, but the question is when the road is not notified then how is it legally correct
 sutron ke mutabik opi sharma ko isaki jaankaree nahin thi ki jis sadak paraseeling drivechalaaya ja rahaa he us vyapaaree ne agar canvarjan charge jamaa kar bhi die tab bhi ceiling kii afat se nahin batch paaegaa
 Now the matter will be heard after four days on which the MLA will present his side
