 The special session of Delhi Legislative Assembly will begin on 28th June i
e
 Wednesday
 do din kaa ye vishesh satr kejariwal sarkaar ne aanan-fanan bulaayaa he
 Surprisingly, the government has kept silence on why this session has been called
 vidhansabha ke is vishesh satr kii soochna sabhi vidhayakon kii di gai he, lekin ye nahin bataaya gaya ki vidhansabha ke is vishesh satr main charchaa kis baat par hogi
 The special thing is that special sessions are called for any specific reasons and focus on that particular issue
 lekin abhi tak sarkaar yaa spikar kii taraf se is baat kii koi soochna vidhansabha ke sadasyon ko nahin di gai he, ki unhen koun-se maamle par charchaa main bhaag lenaa he yaa phir bahes kerani he
 Two days ago a letter has been sent to all the mlas by the Assembly Secretariat, stating that the special session of the assembly will be held on 28 and 29 June and all the mlas are to be present in this session
 dilli vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netavijendra gupta kemutabik sarkaar kaa ye vishesh satr gaiyr sanvaidhanik he or sarkaar is tarah se janata ke paise barbaad nahin kar sakati
 However, no one from the Aam Aadmi Party or the government was ready to say anything about the session
 bijepi vidhayak o pi sharma ke mutabik kejariwal hameshaa apana guptaegenda lagu karneki koshish main rahete hai or ye vishesh satr bhi isi baat kaa subut he, kyonki agar kisi mudde par satr bulaayaa gaya he, to uski soochna pehle vidhayakon ko di jaani chahie, taaki wo apni taiyaari kar saken, lekin aisa nahin hua he
 Virat Kohli is a cricketer in the Indian cricket team whose girls are very crazy and consider them hot

 They believe Akshay Kumar is like Hollywood actor George Clooney, who is very hot
 darasal, haal hi main ek intervyuu ke dauraan jab anoushka se poocha gaya ki industry main unhen sabase hot actor koun lagate hai to unhone akshay kumaar kaa naam liya
 Aamir said, 'why is Rajinikanth not giving his voice in Dangal' Anushka is always known for her bold rhetoric but she does not like to talk about her personal life
 iske baad bhi ye jodi sabase zyada charchaa main rahati he
 a difficult challenge before the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is that of human trafficking from the sky
 neshnal green tribunel (NGT) se fatkaar khaane ke kuch dinon baad DGCA neeirlinesko circular jari kiya
 According to this, if the human excreta falls down during the flight, then a fine of Rs 50,000 will be paid
 isi mudde par DGCA ne NGT ko bataaya ki wo is aadesh ko lekar ‘majaak kaa paatr’ ban gaya he kyonki bich hawa main vimaanon ketoiletse maanav mel ko neeche giraanaa naammumkin he
 Incidents of such faeces from aircraft have been reported from many places in India and abroad
 ye maamla oktober 2016 main NGT ke paas tab pahunchaa jab dilli nivasee leftinet general (ritred) satvant singh dahia ne shikaayat darj karai ki unke dakshin dilli sthit ghar kii chat par ek vimaan se mel gira
 Though this matter is under consideration, but people are wondering whether this can really happen
 isi mudde par india today kii fact check team ne uddyan visheshgyon se baat kii
 Former Civil Aviation Director General HS Khola asserted, "there is no system in modern aircraft through which human feces can be dropped into the air
" ’martin kansalting ke siio or uddyan takneekee visheshgy mark di martin ne kaha, ‘aadhunik vimaan main onboard kachare (waste) ko edditives ke saath treet karne ke baad alag tanks main store kiya jaataa he jo eendhan, hydrologic, neumatic or air condishning linon se dur hota he
 In the onboard system it is impossible to open the vest soft in the middle
 ye vimaan ke jameen par khadaa hone par hi sambhav ho saktaa he jab lewetary trek ko uske saath joda jaataa he
 'in the 1970s, sewer west lines were not adequately sealed, Martin said, resulting in the possibility of garbage leaking
 ye bich hawa main bhi ho saktaa tha
 In modern aircraft there is no way that a pilot or any crew member can open the west line
 ye tabhi sambhav he jab vimaan ke ingine band ho or wo jameen par park hua ho
 More than 30 years ago, air wastes were dumped in the air of older generation aircraft
 lekin wo bhi kabhi-kabhaar
 Those aircraft had a different type of electric system
 tab nile rang ke rasinic kitnashak ke jariye toilet ko flush kiya jaataa tha
 This blue fluid was called 'skychem'
 iske li hone kii sambhaavna rahati thi
 The waste leaks from the malfunctioning valves and freezes when the aircraft exits
 jaise hi vimaan apekshaakrit garm hawa main pahunchataa to kachra neeche gir jaataa tha
 The aircraft's existing vacuum toilet system was designed by James Kemper in 1974
 ise sabase pehle 1982 main ek bowing main feet kiya gaya
 The flush uses very little water because of the sharp suction in the aircraft's toilet and the Teflon walls
 jaise hi aap flush batan dabaate hai to bol ke neeche laga vaikum kachare ko tanks main khinch letaa he
 It is then dumped at the airport via a tanker and removed from the stretch itself
 agar payalat or flite atendents chahen bhi to bich hawa main tanks ko khaali nahin kar sakate
 This is because the valve is outside the plane and can be opened from outside on the ground
 aapane blue aais yaa ‘neeli barf’ ke bare main suna hoga
 It was a waste that leaked from the sewage tank of old aircraft and came out in the middle air and freeze
 isamen keetanunashak nila drav, pani or maanav kaa mel-mutr bhi hota tha
 As the wind was heavy, this blue ice waste fell on the ground
 aisa saadhaaran taur par vimaan ke neeche utarane par hota tha
 The air temperature also increases when the aircraft falls below altitude
 aise main kisi puraane jamaane kevimaanake udate vakt neeli barf aapaki chat par gire to samaj jaaiega ki wo kya he
 However, this is unlikely to happen in modern aircraft
 uttar-purvi dilli se bijepi ke saansad manoj tiwari kaa kahana he ki vah gaate to hai hi, lekin jald hi ek film bhi banaaenge or usamen hero chaahe jo bhi ho, lekin vilan usamen arvind kejariwal ko hi lenge
 During the election meeting in Rohtash Nagar Assembly Constituency of Shahdara, Manoj Tiwari said, "I am going to make a film looking at the streets and problems of Delhi and whatever its hero may be, but the villain has got it, which in 5 days, Delhi has got 5 What would be a bigger villain than the year it had been behind
 tiwari ke mutabik, vah is par film bhi banaaenge or yah film hit bhi jarur hogi
 In fact, BJP mps from all over the country are holding a street corner in Delhi these days and everyone has two things in their speech
 pehla modi sarkaar kaa gungan (jo swaabhaavik he) or doosraa aam aadmi party or arvind kejariwal par jamkar hamale
 The BJP does not formally believe that its competition is directly with the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi, but its speech is clear from the speech being given in the meetings

 If the same company is selling anything else, i don't know what to do
 isse zyada main sirf ye kar saktaa hum ki apni filmon main bevajaah dhumrapaan naa karun
 'please tell that Rajasthan's cancer victim Nanakram publicly appealed to Ajay not to advertise tobacco in the interest of society
 marij ke parivaar ne kaha tha ki nanakarm ajay ke fain hai or wo jiskaa bhi vigyaapan karte hai us har saamaan kaa nanakarm istemaal karte hai
 But now they have realized that tobacco also has adverse effects

 pashchim bengal ke kapadaa mantri shyamapad mukherjee ko pichley maheene pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ke adhikariyon ne sharada chit fund ghotaale main kathith taur par shaamil hone ke maamle main poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa to kehete hai, unhone jaanchakartaaon se mukhyamantri mamata banerjee kaa zikr karte hue guzarish kii, ‘‘dekho, didi mujhe party se nikaal baahar karengi
 "trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee may have been wishing that it would have been better if the problems were overcome with the departure of one of her warlords
" april, 2013 main 2,500 karod ru
 Almost a year after the Saradha chit fund scam was exposed, its stains have started appearing on TMC
 sharada samooh kii ponji skim ke maamle main darjanabhar se zyada tiemasi saansadon se poochtacha ho chuki he
 And it was not enough
 ab kodh main khaaj kii tarah maamla badhata najar aa rahaa he
 Investigators have also started to have a keen eye on Mamta Banerjee herself, which has also brought a cloud of danger to the simplicity and neatly designed image of the politician
 sibiai or idi ke adhikariyon ko andeh he ki ponji skim ke paise se tiemasi netaaon kii saraparasti hasil karke rutaba dikhaane yaa aalochakon kaa munh band karne kii koshish kii gai
 They allege that TMC MP Srunjay Bose was given Rs 60 lakh every month by Sarada chairman Sudipta Sen for almost a year
 kaa bhugtan kiya
 Reason: Bose, the CEO of Bangla newspaper Sambad everyday, allegedly wrote against Sharda and blackmailed Sen to shut his mouth
 srunjay bose se sibiai poochtacha kar chuki he or ve in aaropon kaa khandan kar chuke hai
 On the other hand, Textile Minister Mukherjee paid Rs 46 lakh to his large cement factory in Bankura
 main sen ko bech diya
 Investigators from CBI and ED inspected the factory and found that it was spread over 15 acres while the cell agreement mentioned only 8 acres
 jaanchakartaaon ko andeh he ki mukherjee ko hawala ke jariye karodon ru
 Has been paid ek anya tiemasi saansad ahamed hasan se bhi poochtacha hui he
 Hasan has sold his newspaper Kalam to Dainik Sen for an undisclosed sum
 idi ko andeh he ki sen ne is tarah hasan kaa rutaba kharidne kii koshish kii he
 According to investigators, Sen claimed to have made the investment on behalf of suspended TMC MP Kunal Ghosh, who was believed to be close to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee
 kathith taur par sen ne to yah bhi daawa kiya he ki 2010 main sharada samooh ne biimaar companiyon or un ikaayiyon main nivesh karnaa shuru kiya, jo band hone ke kagaar par thim
 It bought about 20 such units and had about Rs 1,000 crore
 media gharaanon ko die
 The names of many more Trinamool leaders have been revealed in connection with the Saradha scam but investigators are yet to find clues about any disturbances
 masalan, abhinayta or tiemasi ke rajyasabha sadsy mithun chakravarti ko moti rakam dekar company kaa brands ambeseder banaaya gaya tha
 Arpita Ghosh, TMC MP from Belurghat, has been associated with the Saradha Group's media arm and the ED has questioned her again
 agar sibiai apni yojana ke mutabik sharada tour and travels or bhartiya railway cataring or paryaton nigam (iarsitisi) ke bich disambar, 2010 main hue qaraar ke silsile main mukhyamantri mamata banerjee se poochtacha karti he to us samay pashchim bengal kii sattarudh party ko shaayad sabase tagada jhatka lag saktaa he
 Mamta Banerjee was a railway minister at that time
 sibiai ko andeh he ki sharada samooh kii yojana deshbhar main apni vittiya yojanaon ke pradarshan or niveshkon ko aakarshith karne ke liye ek vishesh paryatak train chalaane kii thi
 TMC spokesperson MP Derek o'brien did not respond to repeated calls from India Today in this case
 mamata banerjee ne in maamle main aaropon kaa joardaar khandan kiya he or maamle ke rajnatik rang lene par tiemasi ne sibiai ke khilaaf pradarshan bhi kiya he
 Mamta said in a statement, "trinamool has not even taken a pie from the Saradha group
 aakhir, kisne sharada samooh ke media chounalon ko manjuuri di? centre sarkaar ne di
 If a few puja committees have taken sponsorship of the Saradha group then it does not become our responsibility
 congress or bijepi centre main satta main rahi hai
 Why didn't he take any action? ”mamta also claims that only 12 lakh people have been cheated in the Saradha scam, not 17 lakh people as claimed by the investigating agencies
 ve kahati hai, ‘‘satta main aane ke baad hamane chit fund virdohi kanoon paas kiya
 The center is sitting on it with a coil
 kuch badlaav sujhaaye gaye
 We have amended, so why has it not been approved till date? The opposition was raising the issue of chit funds by looking at the elections closely but that strategy would not work
 ’’sudipt sen ke vakil naresh baalodiya ne india today ko bataaya ki unki jaankaree main sen kabhi mamata banerjee se nahin mili
 Balodia said, "they wanted to invest in electronic and print media, so they signed up with Bose and Hassan
" ’’ mukherjee kii cement factory kii kharid main barti gai aniyamittaaon ke andeh par vakil kaa kahana he, ‘‘vah ek saamaanya kharid-bikri qaraar hi he
 He, however, refuses to say anything about Sen's suspected ties to other TMC mps and party officials, who are under investigation
 haalanki sibiai afasaron ke mutabik, unhen rajya ke netaaon ke ghotaale main shaamil hone ke kai saboot mili hai
 He claims that 400 bank accounts of Saradha Group have been found from which funds have been transferred to suspected companies of the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
 ab jaanch is par kendrit he ki is rakam ko paane vaale asli log koun hai
 The CBI and ED are preparing to send a request letter to the UAE to trace them
 unhen andeh he ki tiemasi ke kai or pramukh naamon kaa khulaasa ho saktaa he
 Obviously, to save the image of the Trinamool Congress, Mamata and her allies may have to put in a lot of effort

 gangrape cese main somvaar ko saket court main ram singh samet sabhi aropiyon kii sunwaayee honi thi
 When the defense lawyer told that Ram Singh had committed suicide, after hearing this news, all the other accused were in awe
 aropiyon ne court se apni suraksha kii guhaar lagaai
 The court has sought an inquiry report on the matter from the Tihar Jail Administration
 saath hi court ne sabhi aropiyon ko bharosa dilaate hue kaha ki unki suraksha kii roj jaanch kii jaaegi
 Significantly, Ram Singh, the main accused in the Delhi gangrape case, who gave a shake up to the country, gave his life
 ajeeb baat he ki sabase surakshit maane jane vaali tihaad jail main ram singh ne faansee laga lee
 He was restless since Sunday night
 uski barrack main 3 or kaidi maujuud the
 One of them saw Ram Singh walking uneasily at around 2 pm and the prison guards at 5 in the morning found him hanging from the window
 tihaad jail prashasan sawaalon ke ghere menram singh kii khudakushi ne tihaad jail prashasan ke ravaiye ko sawaalon ke ghere main laa khadaa kiya he
 Important questions are arising on the manner of hanging, time and circumstances and many other things
 1
 The biggest question is how the prisoner of such a sensitive case got the opportunity to commit suicide so easily
 2
 Ram Singh's height was 5 and a half feet, so how could his hands reach 7 feet high skylight
 3
 The way it is being told that Ram Singh made rope by tearing off blankets and clothes, questions are also being raised
 ram singh kii cell main 3 kaidi or so rahe the
 It must have taken a long time to make the rope, it is strange how no one got a sense of this
 4
 The family members of Ram Singh are raising an important question that the person who had a bad arm, how he made a rope with just one hand, made a noose and then hanged himself with a single hand
 5
 The question is also why Ram Singh chose 5 o'clock in the morning to be hanged, while at 5 o'clock the prisoners are awakened
 6
 So is the Tihar Jail Administration covering some facts
 sawaal yah bhi he ki itani badi laaparvaahee ujagar hone ke baavjood, ab tak kisi par karrwai kyon nahin kii gai
 The special session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly began with an uproar
 aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon ne sadan main shiksha mantri ko 12veen ke rigelt ke liye badhai deni chaahi to vipaksh ke netaa ne 10veen kaksha main fail hue bacchon par sawaal puch liya
 However, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia also responded to the entire matter within the House
 sadan main jawaab dete hue manish sisodiya ne bataaya ki 3 saal pehle sarkari skulon kii haalat kaaphi kharaab thi
 But today, confusion is being created at the 10th result
 sisodiya ne kaha ki lambey samay baad no ditension policy se hataakar board pariksha hui he
 By the 8th the children were failing
 paas hone vaale bacchon kaa aankada 30 fisadi se badhkar 70 fisadi tak pahunchaa he
 The real reason for the uproar in the Delhi Legislative Assembly was the opposition leader's question when he asked for information about the return of the increased fees by the private school to the guardian
 vijendra gupta ne sadan poocha ki abhi tak kitne abhibhavakon ko 9% byaaj ke saath fees lautaai gai he? iskaa amount kitna he? jawaab main manish sisodiya ne bataaya ki 106 karod rupee abhibhavakon se zyada liya gaya tha wo hoicourt main jamaa kiya gaya he
 Also 68 crore rupees have been returned to parents
 haalanki manish sisodiya ko bich main rokte hue vijendra gupta ne fees lautaane vaale skulon ke naam, amount or abhibhavak ke naam kii list maangate hue kaha ki ab tak ek bhi abhibhavak ko fees waapas nahin mili he
 During this, Speaker Ramnivas Goyal asked Vijender Gupta that you are challenging the reply of the Education Minister? Meanwhile, BJP mlas and Aam Aadmi Party mlas started the uproar
 vipaksh netaa ek taraf sawaal puch rahe the to vahiin 'aap' ke vidhayak sadan main iskaa virodh bhi karte nazar aae
 Sisodia erupted in the House and replied that if the evidence of refund of fees is kept in the House, will the opposition leaders apologize
 sisodiya ne aage kaha ki sarkaar ne danda chalaakar privet skool se parents ko fees lautaai he
 Vijendra Gupta raised the demand that money should be provided to parents by seeding the accounts of private schools, then in response Manish Sisodia even said that when the time comes, the accounts of your relatives will freeze
 haalanki vidhansabha adhyaksh ne kaha ki vijendra gupta ne fees lautaane ke maamle main jhooth bolaa he

 Local organizers are trying in every way to prove that they can get such big matches successfully
 lekin unhen shaayad yah nahin pataa ki ipiel ke liye bhi ek bada mauka he
 In fact, viewership in the big cities has reached its upper limit in a way
 aise main kai frenchijies ko ab majabuuran apane bijness model main tabdili laate hue chote shaharon kaa rukh karnaa pad rahaa he
 The Dehli Daredevils team has decided to market Raipur as its new home

 Of the nine IPL teams, three have now become the second base
 is tarah se unke chote shaharon kii ore rukh karne ke chalan ne duusari tiimon ko bhi alag jagahon kii ore badaae ke liye prerit kiya he
 This is a new trend and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has also taken notice of it
 pichley saal deccan chargers ko khatm karne ke baad usne 10veen frenchiji ke liye jab tender jari kiye to usamen ahmedabad, vishakhapatnam, indore, dharmashala, jamshedpur, nagpur, katak, kanpur, rajkot or ranchi kaa naam un shaharon ke taur par rakhaa, jo puri tarah se nayaa frenchiji lene kaa adhikaar rakhte the
 Hemant Dua, marketing and commercial head of GMR, the owner of Dehli Daredevils, tells India Today, "ticket sales are a big source of income for any franchise
 bade shaharon main yah bikri ek myne main apane charam bindu tak pahunch chuki he kyonki vahaan ek hi maukey par kai bade aayojan hote rahete hai
 “apart from this, many agencies keep pushing for free passes, especially in the country's capital Delhi
 ”haalanki ipiel ke sidhe prasaaran ke dauraan stadium main khaali siton par camera ghumaane se bachaa jaataa he, lekin bade shaharon ke kai stadimon main match ke dauraan khaali siten najar aa hi jaati hai
 For example, the Punjab franchise started looking for a second ground in 2010 due to lack of viewership for the past several seasons at PCA Stadium in Mohali
 kings ilevan punjab ke sioo karnal arvinder singh kehete hai, ''jis tarah ipiel badha he, use dekhte hue yah samajhadaari kii baat he ki ise nai jagahon par le jaaya jaae
 Chandigarh itself is not a big city
 lekin garmi ke dinon main dharmashala jane kaa vichaar bahut acha he kyonki yah vaise bhi mashhoor paryaton sthal he
 Tickets are still available for the remaining games in Mohali, but tickets for both matches have already been sold at Dharamshala
 ” is frenchiji ko 2010-11 main 35

 The total amount to be paid to the franchise is Rs 90 crore

 The viewership in Kolkata has also been decreasing from year to year
 desh ke sabase bade stadimon main shumaar eden garden main tikaton kii bahut zyada bikri nahin hui he
 It has a seating capacity of 65,000 spectators, which cannot be filled anyway
 keker ke siio venki mysore bhi is baat ko sweekaarte hai ki ipiel main chote shaharon kii ore kadam badhanaa jaldi hi ek chalan ban jayega
 In his words, "there is a lot of enthusiasm and support in the second and third tier cities
" kuch hi samay main do jagahon par khilne se frenchiji ke liye kharch bad jaataa he, lekin duusari taraf yah hamaare liye ek acha nivesh bhi sabit ho saktaa he
 If we compare, we will find that the Delhi Daredevils have raised more money through the sale of tickets
 2012 main to usne firozshah kotla maidan par pune varirs ke khilaaf ek match se ab tak kii apni sabase zyada 5 karod ru
 Was sold
 2013 ke sijan ke shuru main keemten achaanak hi 35 fisadi se 50 fisadi tak badha di gai thim

 The franchise has already spent around Rs 30 crore from the first two matches in Raipur

 In this, the entertainment tax on the sale of tickets from the state government received Rs 8 crore
 kii chhot se hua phayda bhi shaamil he
 There was so much congestion for these matches that the police had to build their first security checkpoint 10 km away from the stadium to control the crowd of 20,000 people who were eager to watch the game closely

 He says, "when you have such facilities in small towns, then obviously new cricket players will be born from these places

 You can see how many players have come out of having facilities

 In order to accommodate Home Minister Kiran Rijiju, the issue of unloading three passengers from an Air India aircraft and delayed flight by the aircraft was hot
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne nagar vimaanan mantralay se haal hi main jitne bhi viipi logon ke kaaran vimaan chalane main deree hui he, us par report maangi he
 Rijiju has regretted NDTV for facing the problems faced by the passengers during this period
 unhone kaha, 'mere kaaran agar kisi ko dikkat hui ho, to main iske liye maafi maangata hum
 'rijiju said,' But the controversy over stopping a flight from Leh on June 24 in its VIP status will end so much, it does not seem so
 vahiin unke mantralay ke varisht mantri bhi kah chuke hai ki aisa viypi treetment thik nahin
 The comments kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh kaa kahana he, 'main nahin chahta ki mere kaaran kisi ko koi pareshaani ho
 'rajnath Singh, who had come to see Baba Amarnath on Thursday, also himself appeared standing in the queue to see
 dilachasp ye he ki is maamle main kiran rigiju ke saath safar kar rahe jammu-kashmir ke up-mukhyamantri nirmal singh ulte payalat par hi badasluki kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 According to Nirmal Singh, the pilot misbehaved
 is puure maamle main jo baaten saamne aa rahi hai, vah ye hai ki jab vimaan ke darvaaze band ho chuke the to us dauraan rigiju ke liye vimaan roka gaya tha or sirf yahi nahin, ek bachche sahit teen musafiron ko vimaan se utaara gaya
 Apart from this, the flight which left at ten past ten minutes took off at about eleven and a quarter
 ab vipaksh ne is viypi treetment par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Congress leader Digvijay Singh, who has spoken on this issue, says that i did not expect this from Rijiju
 har rajnatik party viipi culture khatm karne kaa daawa karti he, lekin koi bhi party is daawey ko amal nahin karvaa paati
 Often, ordinary citizens have to face difficulties due to its ministers or their sentries
 khayr, ummid kii jaani chahie ki is kisse ke baad sabhi mahanubhav isse sabak lenge
 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh says, 'I do not want anyone to have any problem because of me
 ' rajnath singh, jo guuruuvaar ko baba amarnath ke darshan karne pahunche the, vah khud bhi darshan karne hetu qatari main khadey dikhaai die
 Interestingly, in this case, Jammu and Kashmir Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh, who is traveling with Kiran Rijiju, is blaming the pilot on the contrary
 nirmal singh ke mutabik, payalat ne galat vyavhaar kiya
 The things that are coming out in this whole case are that when the doors of the plane were closed, the plane was stopped for Rijiju and not only that, three passengers including a child were unloaded
 iske alaava, das baj kar das minute par ravaanaa hone vaali flite ne kareeb sava gyaarah baje udaan bhari
 Now the opposition has raised questions on this VIP treatment
 is mudde par bayaanbaji karne vaale congressi netaa digvijay singh kaa kahana he ki mujhe rigiju se ye ummid nahin thi
 Every political party claims to end VIP culture, but no party is able to implement this claim
 aksar uske mantri yaa phir unke santariyon ke kaaran aam nagarikon ko dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Well, it is to be hoped that after this story, all the dignitaries will learn from this
 is puure maamle main jo baaten saamne aa rahi hai, vah ye hai ki jab vimaan ke darvaaze band ho chuke the to us dauraan rigiju ke liye vimaan roka gaya tha or sirf yahi nahin, ek bachche sahit teen musafiron ko vimaan se utaara gaya

 To tighten the brokers in train ticket booking, the Ministry of Railways has made changes in the rules regarding online e-tickets and i-tickets, under which now any passenger will be able to book only six tickets in a month, whereas each before 10 tickets could be booked in a month by login
 railway dwaara apni website ke durupyog ko rokane ke liye kiye gaye faislon ke tahat iarsitisi par ek yuzar idi se ek din main sirf do tikat (subah 8 se raat 10 baje tak) hi maanya hai, jabaki tatkaal booking main bhi 10 baje se 12 baje tak do tikaten hi book karwaai ja sakengi
 The comments iske alaava agent booking shuru hone ke pehle aadhe ghante tak tikat book nahin karvaa sakate, tathaa 8 baje se 12 baje tak i-wolet or kaishcard se booking nahin kii jaaegi
 The new rules of Railways are going to come into effect from 15 February 2016
 gauratlab he ki haal hi main railway ne general tikat ke niyamon main bhi badlaav kiye the, jinke tahat general tikat ab sirf teen ghante tak maanya rahegaa
 According to senior railway officials, this step has been taken to prevent misuse of e-ticket booking facility, as it is seen that ordinary passengers do not need to book tickets more than six times a month
 
 unhone bataaya ki tikat booking se sambandhit aankadon ke vishleshan se pataa chalaa he ki 90 pratishat upabhokta maheene main chah tikat book karte hai, or mahaj 10 pratishat log chah se zyada tikat book karte hai, isliye aisa lagata he ki shesh 10 fisadi upabhokta sambhavat: tikaton kii dallali kar rahe the
 As per the decisions taken by the Railways to prevent the misuse of its website, only two tickets a day (from 8 am to 10 pm) are valid on IRCTC with a user ID, while in Tatkal booking also from 10 am to 12 pm
 Up to two tickets can be booked
 tippaniyan Apart from this, agents cannot book tickets for half an hour before the booking starts, and booking will not be done from 8 am to 12 pm using e-wallet and cashcard
 railway ke nae niyam 15 farvari, 2016 se lagu hone ja rahe hai
 It is to be noted that recently, the Railways had also made changes in the rules of General Ticket, under which General Ticket will now be valid for only three hours
 railway ke varisht adhikariyon ke anusaar, i-tikat booking kii suvidha ke durupyog ko rokane ke lihaaz se yah kadam uthaaya gaya he, kyonki aisa dekha ja rahaa he ki saamaanya yatriyon ko maheene main chah baar se zyada tikat book karne kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 He said that analysis of data related to ticket booking showed that 90 percent of consumers book six tickets in a month, and only 10 percent of people book more than six tickets, so it seems that the remaining 10 percent of consumers probably Were touting the tickets
 iske alaava agent booking shuru hone ke pehle aadhe ghante tak tikat book nahin karvaa sakate, tathaa 8 baje se 12 baje tak i-wolet or kaishcard se booking nahin kii jaaegi

 Many flaws are seen in the film, such as entering Goldman's house very easily, after several murders failed to try to catch Goldman, the four agents stayed in a hotel in Pakistan and wandered comfortably outside and even pasted There have been other things too
 jabaki har televijan channel or akhbaar main unki tasviren dikhaai ja chuki hai
 Arjun Rampal brings his injured fellow agent to the hotel and no one catches him in Pakistan
 is tarah ke kai sikvence jatke dete hai
 If there were no claims of deep research, then all these scenes could have been ignored and we would think that we are watching an entertainment film of the era of 70s and 80s
 tippaniyan The one-line concept of the film has its own strengths, but the team failed to outplay the script to spread the story and keep the screen play tight
 vahiin rishi kapur hindustan ke number-1 or america ke nan-2 most wonted nahin lagate
 Also, i did not understand the need for a love track in the story, because these tracks could not become strong due to lack of time

 Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N
 Kiran Kumar Reddy met Congress President Sonia Gandhi today and discussed the matter amid pressure from the pro-telangana groups to take a quick decision on the issue of a separate state
 somvaar subah rajdhani pahunchane ke turant baad reddy ne rajya ke prabharee eisisi ke mahasachiv gulam nabi aaazaad ke saath ek ghante tak baithak kii
 He then went to Sonia Gandhi's residence where Ahmed Patel, the political secretary of the Congress president, also joined him
 party ke pravaktaa pi si chaako ne 30 janvari ko kaha tha ki congrestelugana ke gathnake khilaaf nahin he lekin aupchaariktaaon ko puraa karne ke liye use samay kii jarurat he
 He indicated that this process has been expedited
 chaako ne kaha, ‘congress telugana rajya ke khilaaf nahin he
 We are in the decision making process but the formalities have to be completed
 ’gauratlab he ki telugana par 28 disambar ko sarvadaleey baithak ke baad kendriya grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia ne kaha tha ki is mudde par nirnay ek maah ke bheetar liya jayega
 In view of this, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N

 In France, the prohibition on offering Namaz on the streets came into effect from Friday and thousands of Muslims were taken to temporary alternative places for prayers
 paris se lekar marceli tak jumme ke namaajiyon ko baiyrakon yaa anya asthaayee bhawanon main pahunchaa diya gaya
 In fact, offering prayers on the streets has become a political issue under right-wing President Nicolas Sarkozy
 europe main musalamaanon kii sarvaadhik aabaadi vaale desh france ne isi saal musalamaanon ke burka pahanane par roak laga di thi or isi saptaah grahamantri cloud guint ne chetavanee di ki 16 sitambar se sadakon par koi namaji nahin honge
 Last month, Guent said that if anyone violates, it will be banned
 sadakon par namaaj adaa karnaa asweekaarya he or yah dharmanirpekshata ke siddhant par sidhaa hamalaa he
 He spoke of calling the police against the violator
 jharkhand main vidhansabha chunaav kii bisaat bichaai jane lagi he
 The BJP has completely come back into the fray
 jabaki mahagathbandhan ke bich seat shering ke formule par abhi tak sahmati nahin ban pai he
 The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha has raised the restlessness of the Congress and other allies by claiming more than half the assembly seats
 jharkhand kii kul 82 vidhansabha siten hai, jinamein se 81 par chunaav hote hai or ek sadsy ko manonith kiya jaataa he
 JMM is seeking 41 seats
 is tarah se baaki bachi 40 vidhansabha siton se hi vipakshi dalon ko santosh karnaa padegaa
 In this, Congress, JMM, RJD and Left parties will have to divide seats among themselves
 jharkhand main congress 25 siten maang rahi he
 Apart from this, the claim of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha led by Babulal Marandi also has at least 15 seats
 aise main argedy sahit vamadalon ke liye siton kii gunjaaish nahin batch rahi he
 This is the reason why JMM has increased the restlessness of other allies
 jeemem ke netaa ne naam na chhapane kii shart par bataaya ki pichley vidhansabha chunaav main hamaari party kaa pradarshan baaki sahyogi dalon se behatar tha
 We had managed to win 25 seats even by fighting alone
 vahiin, congress netaa pradeep balamuchu ne kaha ki vidhansabha siton ko lekar abhi kuch tay nahin hua he
 Now we are first starting to strengthen our Congress in the state
 loksabhaa main haar ke kaarnon ko pataa kar rahe hai
 In fact, on 10 July, there was a meeting of opposition parties led by JMM President Hemant Soren, in which it was decided that no party will leave the seats won
 haalanki bachi hui siton par kisi tarah kii koi sahmati nahin ban saki thi
 It is not yet decided on the issue that who will get the seats of the six mlas who won on the JMM ticket, who later joined the BJP
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main rajd kaa bhi khaataa nahin khul paaya tha
 The share of the Left parties was also negligible
 jabaki masus se ek or bhakpa (maale) se ek vidhayak jitkar vidhansabha pahunch paae the
 The clan of the Left parties includes parties like CPI, CPI (M), Forward Bloc etc
 loksabhaa chunaav main gathbandhan ke baavjood argedy ne sirf chatra seat se candidet utaara tha
 RJD did not seat its candidate even after much effort
 vahiin, loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan vamadalon ko gathbandhan se baahar rakhaa gaya tha
 This time too, the Left parties are not very keen on joining the Grand Alliance
 yahi vajah he ki hemanth sorain ke yahaan hui baithak main sirf masus or farward block ke netaaon ne shirkat kii thi
 The CPI, CPM and CPI (male) etc
 kept a distance from the meeting
 chunavi survey saamaanya si baat he, lekin is baar ke survey chunaav parinaamon kii jo sambhavit tasviir pesh kar rahe hai, unase to yahi lagata he ki is baar donon hi pramukh dal congress or bijepi bahumat se kaaphi dur rahenge or ek aisi trishanku loksabhaa banegi, jisamen jod-tod kii puri gunjaaish rahegi
 It will be a sad thing for democracy
 hamane gathbandhan sarkaron kii majaburiyon ko dekha he ki kaise bade faisle lene main unke haath bandhe hote hai or kaise sahyogi dal aapni baton ko rashtrahit se bhi upar rakhte hai
 The biggest obstacle to the functioning of the UPA-2 government was the non-cooperation attitude of the allies
 unhone apane nihit swaarthon kii khatir kaamkaaj main dher sari baadhaaen pahunchaai or kai baar sarkaar kii nitiyon ko apane hisaab se modaa
 The biggest example of this is the DMK, which influenced many policies of the UPA government
 tamilon kii sahanubhuti batorne ke liye usne bharat kii videsh niti main aatmghaatee badlaav karavaaya, jiskaa nateeja he ki china srilanka main apane pair jamaata ja rahaa he or hamen chaaron ore se gherne kii apni niti main safalataa paa rahaa he
 This means that coalition governments have their own compulsions and this often causes trouble for the country
 aane vaale samay main yah desh ke saamne or samasyaayein khadi karegaa
 Another thing is that Congress should not completely reject these survey reports
 use chintan or aatm manthan karnaa hoga ki aakhir kyon yah haalat paidaa hui he ki aaj uski saakh itani gir gai he ki use mahaj sau ke aankade ke paas pahunchataa dikhaaya ja rahaa he? use abhi bhi chet janaa chahie or kuch kar dikhaanaa chahie
 Right now there is so much time in the Lok Sabha elections that it can show some concrete tax
 policy paralisis na to uske hit main he or na desh ke hit main

 With this, Bangalore made strong strides towards the play-offs, while Rajasthan's hopes of reaching the final four were almost exhausted
 match kaa scorcard jaanane ke liye yahaan clic karentventi-20 lig ke sabase yuva captain bane viraat kohli ne toss jitkar rajasthan ko ballebaaji kaa nyauta diya
 Rajasthan failed to capitalize on the good start of Shane Watson (34) and Rahul Dravid (37) and were able to score 146 runs for six wickets at regular intervals
 uski is dasha ke liy shrinath arvind jimmedaar rahaa jinhone 34 ran dekar teen wicket liye
 Gayle (70 not out off 44 balls) and Tillakaratne Dilshan (38) added 68 runs off just 40 balls to give Bangalore a quick start
 iske baad gail ne kohli (naabad 39) ke saath 83 ran kii atoot saajhedaari kii jisase bangalore 17 over main hi ek wicket par 151 ran bana baitha
 Bangalore now have 15 points from seven wins in 11 matches and have moved up to second place after Mumbai in the points table
 rajasthan kii yah chhathi haar he or 12 match main 11 ank hone se uski ab play aaf main pahunchane kii sambhaavna ksheen pad gayi he
 Bangalore added Gayle to their team in the middle of the tournament and since then it is not taking the name of the Caribbean storm to a standstill
 gail ne abhi tak chah match main do shatak or ek ardhashatak kii madad se 398 ran banaaye hai
 Only Sachin Tendulkar (424) has more runs than him in the tournament
 in pehle chah over main kul 11 chauke pade jinamein se aath chauke dilashaan ke balle se nikle jabaki gail ne teen chaukon ke alaava botha kii gend par long aaf par pari kaa pehla chakka bhi jadaa
 Playing his last IPL match at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Rajasthan's home ground, Shane Warne took the ball in the seventh over and cooled Dilshan's stride as soon as he arrived
 srilankai captain ne unki gend par slog sweep karke midwicket par rose tailor ko kaich thamaya
 Gayle was at the crease but the Bangalore batsmen preferred to score runs easily
 powerple main jahaan 66 ran bane vahiin agle chah over main keval 35 ran hi ban paye
 Gayle's slaughtering mood then showed
 unhone tailor kii gend chah ran ke liye bhejkar ardhashatak puraa kiya or phir warn par lagaataar chakka or chaukaa jadaa
 After this, he also sent the ball of Ashok Maneria for six runs while Kohli scored the winning six over Pankaj Singh
 gail ne apni pari main chah chauke or chaar chakke jabaki kohli ne teen chauke or ek chakka lagaaya
 Warne thus farewell to Jaipur with desperation
 isse pehle watasan or dravid ne pehle wicket ke liye 73 ran kii saajhedaari kii lekin in donon ke isi score par out ho jane se rails dabaav main aa gaya or dedh sau ran ke paar nahin pahunch paaya
 Watson and Dravid initially showed their attitude by putting two fours in successive overs on Arvind and Zaheer Khan respectively
 niyamit captain danniel vittori ke chotil hone ke kaaran unki jagah team main aaye charl longavelt par watasan ne pari kaa pehla chakka bhi jadaa
 He then sent the ball of Arvind for six runs but the bowler in his next over within three balls sent both the openers to the pavilion and sent Rajasthan to the backfoot
 arvind ne watasan ko hawa main gend lahraane ke liye lalachaaya or baaki kaam midaaf par khadey abi divilliars ne puraa kar diya
 He then forced Dravid to take a catch
 bich main kohli ne khud gend sanbhali or teen over main 17 ran diye
 He also made debutant left-arm spinner Abrar Kazi in Twenty20 cricket bowling after returning to the opening pair pavilion
 ajinkya rahane (17) ne kaaji ke duusare over main chakka jadaa
 Two balls later, Johann Botha ran despite losing the ball to the hands of de Villiers, one of the world's fielder and Rahane lost their wicket
 botha (19) or rose tailor (13) bhi koi kamaal nahin dikhaa paye, jabaki maneria (8) bhi adhik der tak nahin tik paye jisase yah tay ho gaya ki rajasthan majboot score khadaa nahin kar paaegaa

 Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi has given a befitting reply to Anna Hazare
 rahul gandhi anna kii hi style main nikal pade hai, unke ultimatum se muqabla karne
 Rahul has said that corruption can only be dealt with in a democratic way
 anna ke ultimatum se congress tilamila gai he
 Although no direct attack was uttered by any Congress leader on the saint of Ralegan, but he certainly released arrows in other ways
 rahul gandhi ne ishaaron main kaha ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai kaa jo tarika anna hajaare kaa he wo sahi nahin he, balki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai loktantr ke jariye hi ladi ja sakati he
 Rahul Gandhi's statement has made it clear that the Congress is not afraid of Anna's ultimatum
 vaise bhi jis yuva shakti kii baat anna hajaare karte hai, usee yuva shakti ko rijhaane main lage hai rahul gandhi
 Otherwise, Rahul Gandhi, who went to address the gathering in Rohini, Delhi, does not go by metro like the general public
 or naa hi neeche utar kar radio taxi pakadte
 Seeing Rahul's attitude against Anna, other Congress leaders have also opened a front against Anna
 anna ke khilaaf congress ne apana rukh saaf kar diya he lekin anna ke tevar bhi tikhe hai yani janalokapal ko lekar anna or congress ke bich lambii ladaai chhid sakati he

 ek aspataal, 42 years, ek bistar, And just four walls to stare
 wo shunya main dekhati rahati thi
 She had probably gone into the world's longest silence
 wo na bol sakati thi, naa bataa sakati thi
 Aruna was 24 years old when she was lying on the bed for treatment
 aaj jab wo antim yatra par nikali to pehali baar bistar se uth pai
 Aruna was 67 years old in bed
 unhen pataa hi nahin chalaa ki kya kuch badal chukaa he is duniya main
 Aruna was just taking breath
 
 
 ahsaas to kab ke khatm ho chuke the
 There was only one feeling of pain
 saare shabd, tivi par aati sari tasviren us dard ko bhala kaise bayaan kar paaengi jo aruna pichley 42 saal se jhel raheen thi
 How can we tell the fate of that unfortunate doctor lover who came and stayed at Aruna's bedside many times
 aruna tab bhi sunn padi raheen
 How would she answer, what would she be punished for? 4 saal tak premi doctor koshish karata rahaa ki aruna shaayad bol pade
 And when it seemed that she would never speak now, she said goodbye
 khamoshi to sab ko salti he
 
 
 The beloved doctor got married
 aruna jaisi thi waisi hi rahi
 Alone and silent
 wo doctor shaayad ab 70 saal ke honge
 i do not know whether he got any news of Aruna
 us parivaar par kya likhuun jo apni 24 saal kii beti-bahan ko bistar par chhod gaya hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye
 What news should i find of that madman Sohanlal, who gave Aruna such a huge punishment for a testimony
 sohanlal wordboy tha or aruna keiem kii nurse
 Aruna agreed to the complaint of Sohanlal's doings
 saat saal main wo chhot gaya lekin aruna jindagi bhar bistar se uth na pai
 Aruna was silent, but her behavior changed with the presence of a man
 wo aadhi adhuri saanson main bhi bataa detii thi ki uske aasapaas koi mard na fatke
 6 years ago we interviewed many people working in that ward of KEM
 kuch ko camere ke saamne, kuch ko bina camere ke
 i thought that there would be someone who would want to get rid of someone who does not have any relationship with them
 hamen koi na mila
 No one said that take away the remaining breath of Aruna and give her the wish of death
 tippaniyan Even when the case reached the Supreme Court, it was felt that someone would 'argue' that death is better than this condition
 lekin hame koi nahin mila
 Was happy then
 hindustan ke medical itihaas or training main shaayad hi aisi koi kahani mili jo kisi aspataal main aane vaale har nae stoff ko bataaen ki jo ek ward main, ek bistar par leti he wo apni beti he
 He has to handle us
 aruna kii kahani jab-jab likhane baitha hum 
 
 
 Then i have been questioning why and for what reason was she suffering this pain for the last 4 decades
 aruna kii khamoshi kaa safar aaj khatm ho gaya
 She will keep reminding us how there is a Sohanlal among us
 
 
 hamaare bich pasopesh main padaa premi he
 
 
 Are relatives
 ek lekhika he jo sachhee dost he, chaahati he ki mukt ho jaae aruna saare dard se
 And also that there is also a hospital staff, a group of unnamed people, who were willing to commit their lives to keep someone alive
 aruna jab bistar par ilaaj ke liye letai gai tab 24 saal kii thi
 Today, when she set out on her last journey, she was able to get up from bed for the first time
 aruna bistar par hi 67 saal kii ho gayi
 They did not know if anything had changed in this world
 aruna sirf saanse le rahi thim
 
 
 Realization was over when sirf ek hi ahsaas tha dard kaa
 All the words, how will all the pictures on TV tell the pain that Aruna was facing for the last 42 years
 ham us abhaage doctor premi ke pasopesh ko bhi kaise bataaen jo aruna ke sirahaane aakar kai baar tehra rahaa
 Aruna was still numb
 kaise detii wo jawaab, kya bataati kis cheez kii sazaa use mil rahi he
 For 4 years, the lover doctor kept trying that Aruna might speak
 or jab lagane laga ki wo ab kabhi nahin bolegi to alavida kah diya
 Silence hurts everyone
 
 
 premi doctor ne byaah kar liya
 Aruna remained the same
 akeli or khamosh
 Those doctors will probably be 70 years old now
 pataa nahin unhen aruna kii koi khabar mili yaa nahin
 What should i write about the family who left their 24-year-old daughter and sister in bed forever
 us siraphire sohanlal kii kya khoj khabar luun, jisane aruna ko ek gavaahi kii itani badi sajaa de di
 Sohanlal was a wardboy and Aruna was kem's nurse
 sohanlal kii kaamchori kii shikaayat par hami bhari thi aruna ne
 In seven years he was left but Aruna could not get up from bed for life
 aruna, khamosh jarur thi lekin uskaa vyavhaar kisi mard kii maujuudagi se badal jaataa tha
 She used to tell even half-baked breaths that no men should get around her
 6 saal pehle hamane keiem ke us ward main kaam karne vaale kai logon kaa intervyuu kiya
 Some in front of the camera, some without the camera
 sochaa tha ki koi to hoga jo nijaat chahta hoga aise shaks se jiskaa koi nahin he, jisase unka koi naata nahin he
 We did not find any
 kisi ne nahin kaha ki chin lo bachi khuchi saanse aruna kii or de do use ichha mrityu
 The comments jab cese supreme court pahunchaa tab bhi laga ki koi to 'tark' degaa, ki is haalat se behatar to maut he
 But we did not get any
 khushi hui thi tab
 Hardly any such story can be found in India's medical history and training that tells every new staff in a hospital that who is lying in a ward, on a bed, is his daughter
 use hamen sanbhaalanaa he
 Whenever i am writing the story of Aruna
 
 
 tab tab sawaal karata rahaa hum ki aakhir kyon or kisaliye bhugat rahi thi ye dard wo pichley 4 dashak se
 Aruna's journey to silence ended today
 wo hamen yaad dilaati rahegi ki kaise hamaare bich hi ek sohanlal he
 
 
 We have a lover lying in the neighborhood
 
 
 rishtedaar hai
 There is a writer who is a true friend who wants Aruna to be free from all pain
 or ye bhi ki ek aspataal kaa stoff bhi he, benaam logon kaa samooh, jo kisi ko jinda rakhane ke liye ji jaan lagane ko taiyaar tha

 Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah was recently on a visit to Madhya Pradesh
 vahaan par unhone ek aisa bayaan diya, jisase kai netaaon ke chehre par muskaan aa gai
 Shah said in his statement that there is no such rule in his party that a person above 75 years cannot become a minister
 saaf he ki shah ke is bayaan ke kai myne nikaale ja sakate hai
 Modi made rules in 2014 When PM Modi elected his cabinet in 2014, he did not give leaders above 75 years a place in the cabinet
 jiske kaaran bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani, murali manohar joshi jaise kai netaa mantri nahin ban paae the
 But now after the statement of Shah, it can get relaxed in the coming Lok Sabha elections and the assembly elections that are going to be held before that
 inke alaava modi ke baad gujarat kii mukhyamantri bani anandiben patel ne bhi badhati umr ke kaaran istipha de diya tha
 He also mentioned this in his Facebook post
 agar is prakaar kii dheel milti he to in logon ko mil saktaa he phayda- maujuuda loksabhaa spikarsumitra mahajan74 varsh kii ho gai hai
 He has been an MP from Indore for a long time, but it is clear after Shah's statement that he can get a Lok Sabha ticket in 2019 as well
 - himachal pradesh ke chunaav jald hi hone vaale hai, party ko vahaan par ek anbhavi chehre kii talash he
 After this decision, 82-year-old Shanta Kumar can once again enter the race of minister or chief minister
 - karnataka main bijepi yeddurappa ke netritv main chunaav ladane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 His age is also crossing 75, but now after this statement his path has been cleared
 - upi cote se centre main mantri calraj mishra bhi 75 kii umr paar kar chuke hai, lekin 2019 chunaav or purvanchal ke votaron ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yah kadam baari pad saktaa tha
 - Also Prem Kumar Dhumal (73), Gulab Chand Kataria (72), Amra Ram (74), Bhagat Singh Kosari (75), Hukmdev Yadav (77), c
 pi
 The fate of many leaders like Thakur (85) may be awake
 inkaa kataa tha patta- laal krishna adwani (89), murali manohar joshi (83) - mantri pad nahin mila, raashtrapati / uparashtrapati pad se bhi dur rakhaa gaya
 - Anandiben Patel, the Chief Minister of Gujarat - had to resign as Chief Minister due to old age
 - najma hepatulla - centre main alpsankhyak maamalon kii mantri rah chuki hai, lekin umr 75 paar pahunchate hi pad ko chhodana padaa
 - Yashwant Singh - Yashwant Singh (84), who was a minister in the Atal government, did not even get a ministerial position, he said that 75+ people in BJP have been declared brain dead
 haalanki unke bete jayant sinha ko mantri banaaya gaya tha
 Elections are to be held in these states
 Let us tell you that before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, many state assembly elections are to be held in the country
 in rajyon main gujarat, himachal pradesh, chhattisgarh, madhyapradesh, karnataka, meghalaya, mizoram, nagaland, rajasthan, tripura, sikkim, arunachal, telugana, odisha or andhra pradesh shaamil hai
 Uttar Pradesh will not get a chance to host any of the Indian Premier League matches this year as no state stadium is named in the ipl-issued calendar
 kisi bhi frenchiji ne kanpur ke green park or lakhanu ke nav nirmit ikana stadium main match karaane main koi ruchi nahin dikhaai he
 The last two years in Green Park, the Gujarat Lions team played two matches each
 lekin uttar pradesh cricket sangh ke padaadhikariyon ke mutabik ipel chairman rajeev shukla ne apane grihnagar main match ke aayojan ke liye vyaktigat ruchi dikhaai thi or isi vajah se kanpur ko ye match mili
 But the lack of facilities like good hotels and airport in Kanpur this time was the biggest reason for the indifference of IPL franchise owners
 pitiai ke mutabik upisie ke siio lalit khanna ne kaha, ‘kanpur ke green park stadium ko to pehle hi is baar kisi bhi frenchiji ipel team ne lene main ruchi nahin dikhaai thi
 "in the last ODI, these 4 squads can get a chance in the playing XI", he said, "delhi Daredevils were interested in Lucknow's Ekana Stadium and their team also visited Ikana earlier this month
 lekin, pataa nahin baad main kya hua ki jab ipel kaa calendar jari hua to usamen lakhanu kaa stadium bhi shaamil nahin he
 UPCA sources said that apart from the Delhi Daredevils, attempts were also made to bring the returned Rajasthan Royals matches to Lucknow but the Royals chose their home ground Jaipur
 sutara kehete hai ki abhi bhi upisie is baat ko lekar ashanvit he ki agar samay par jaipur kaa savai maansingh stadium taiyaar na ho paaya to shaayad rajasthan royles ke ek do match antim samay main lakhanu ke ikana stadium kii jholii main gir jaaen
 However, its probability is almost non-existent
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi neloksabhaa main kisaanon kaa muddauthaya or modi sarkaar ko gherne kii koshish kii
 When Rahul finished his speech, Mike of the Congress camp was happy with the voices of 'well done, well done'
 rahul ne centre sarkaar par yakeenan tikhaa hamalaa bolaa, lekin unke bhaashan ke dauraan kuch aise pal bhi aae jinhone sunne waalon ke chehre par ek muskuraahat numaayan kar di
 1
 'baith jaao pappu babu'rahul gandhi ke bhaashanke bich main satta paksh ke log spikar ke lakh samajhane ke baad bhi tikaa-tippni kar rahe the
 In such a situation, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu stood up and appealed to let the debate go on peacefully
 lekin ekbargi sab hairaan rah gaye jab venkaiya ne kaha, 'pappu babu baith jaao
 During the speech of Rahul, he was appealing to sit with which 'pappu'
 darasal yah pappu, bihar ke nami netaa pappu yadav the

 'aapke pradhanmantri nahin hai kya?'rahul apane bhaashan main narendra modi ke liye baar-baar'aapke pradhanmantri'shabd kaa istemaal kar rahe the
 When the BJP mps objected to this, Rahul immediately called the 'prime Minister of the country'
 lekin agle hi pal unhen na jane kya soojha jo vah bole, 'kyon aapke pradhanmantri nahin hai kya? desh ke to hai hi, aapke nahin hai kya?' apane yuvaraj ke is twarit hasya bodh par congressi khemaa khulkar hansata dekha gaya

 'suut kaa zikr na karenge, khush?'yaad kariye vah samay jab rahul ne ek raily main narendra modi ke kathith 'das lakhiya' suut kaa zikr kiya tha or iske baad raaton-raat modi kaa suut samachar channelon kii hedlins ban gaya
 The suit was later auctioned
 rahul somvaar ko apane bhaashan main usasut ko bhi yaad karnaa bhi nahin bhuule
 He called the Modi government a suit-booted government and also said, 'the matter with that suit is over
 aapane uskaa ocshan kar diya
 Now we will not speak on that
 khush?'4
 'I will speak in Hindi too' Rahul had started speaking that the mps of the ruling party started making noise
 unase nipatane ke liye rahul ne jaanate hai kya kaha, 'baith jaaie, ghabrie mat
 i will also speak in Hindi ' On July 14, Rahul Gandhi was discussing the party's position and election preparations in Chhattisgarh at the Congress headquarters
 us dauraan chhattisgarh ke party adhyaksh bhupesh baghel ne ajit jogi kii janata congress chhattisgarh (jessisi) ke liye "bhaajapa kii bi timy shabd kaa istemaal kiya
 Before Baghel could tell how many seats Jogi's party could harm the Congress, Rahul Gandhi shared his feedback that Jogi, Gondwana Ganatantra Party (GGP), Chhattisgarh Swabhiman Manch (CSM) and In alliance with the National People's Party (NPEP), they are contesting the assembly elections
 rahul gandhi ko chhattisgarh kaa yah feedback apni us "gupt'' team se hasil hua he jisamen party ke chaatr sanghathan enesuai ke kai log shaamil hai
 This team sends its feedback to the party president every 15 days
 baithak main shaamil logon ke mutabik, rahul gandhi ne is sanket ke saath baithak kaa samaapan kiya ki '2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bhaajapa banaam anya kii neenv daalane ke liye chhattisgarh sabase upyukt rajya ho saktaa he
 "the state Congress unit is looking at the election of Chhattisgarh as a battle against the Raman government, but Rahul Gandhi is looking at the election of Chhattisgarh as against Narendra Modi," says journalist Ramesh Sharma, an expert on political affairs in Chhattisgarh
 
 agar aisa nahin hota to 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa se mahaj 0
 The Congress, which gets 75 per cent less votes, does not think of making the state assembly elections an alternative to the BJP versus others
 ''chhattisgarh kaa siyaasi sameekaran hi kuch is tarah kaa ban gaya he ki yahaan sattavirohi rujhaan hote hue bhi congress bhaajapa se maat kha jaati he
 Although the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) could win only one seat in the last assembly election, it directly defeated the Congress in seven seats
 darasal, un siton par trikoniya mukaable main bhaajapa aage nikal gai
 In the three seats, the BSP pushed the Congress to number three
 isi tarah jijipi ne paanch, siesam manch ne teen, enpieepi or ensipi 1-1 siton par congress kii haar kii vajah bani
 Overall, the Congress lost 20 seats because of these parties
 congress ke ek varisht netaa kaa kahana he, "agar 2013 main in dalon ke saath congress kaa gathbandhan hua hota to bhaajapa 30 siton par simat kar rah jaati
 Even if there was an alliance with the BSP too, the Congress would have got 3 more than the BJP
 5 fisadi adhik vot milte
 "they say," This time the pan was heavy for the Congress because the BJP, which has formed the government in the state for three consecutive times, is struggling with anti-incumbency
 lekin ajit jogi ne congress se alag hokar apni party banaakar khel bigaad diya he
 "actually, Jogi is in a position to cut the votes of Congress in all the seats in the state
" kam se kam 20 siton par to unka kaaphi prabhaav he
 In such a situation, alliance with BSP is not enough for Congress
 agar jogi enpieepi, jijipi, siesam jaisi partiyon se pehle hi gathbandhan kar lete hai to congress ke liye or mushkil ho jaaegi
 In such a situation, a coalition led by Jogi may come second after the BJP
 yah sthiti na sirf chhattisgarh ke lihaaj se congress ko nuksaan pahunchaayegi balki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye bhi use jhatka lagegaa
 The BJP will be in a position to say that the Congress could not even become the main opposition party in the state
 aise main rashtriya paridrishy main congress kii ahmiyat or kam hogi
 Congress also realizes this
 isliye congress kaa sheersh netritv na sirf basapa balki enpieepi, siesam, jijipi, ensipi jaisi partiyon ke saath gathbandhan karnaa chaah rahi he
 If this initiative of the Congress pays off, it will not only avoid the threat of Jogi but will also be able to compete with the BJP in the state
 iske saath hi use rashtriya str par modi banaam anya ke lakshya kii disha main badaae main bhi safalataa milegi
 State Congress President Baghel also believes that the party will benefit by having an alliance with the BSP and other parties in the elections
 lekin ve kehete hai ki gathbandhan karne kaa faisla party kaa kendriya netritv hi legaa
 Baghel states, “there is no dearth of issues against the Raman government
 congress adivaasiyon se lekar kisaanon tak ke mudde ko lekar gaanv-gaanv tak ja rahi he
 The Congress is also telling people that Ajit Jogi's party is bjp's b team
 ''lekin chunaav main siyaasi ank ganit kaa zyada mahatv he
 The BSP had taken nearly four per cent of the votes in the last assembly elections and the BJP was only 0 from the Congress
 75 fisadi zyada vot paakar congress ke mukaable 10 siten adhik hasil kar lee thi
 According to Congress sources, when Rahul Gandhi went to Chhattisgarh in June last, he had told the party's booth officials that he had to compete with the BJP, so do not waste time in fighting hands with people of other parties
 alabatta, is baat ke liye unhone jarur sajag rahane kaha tha ki kisi bhi haalat main kisi bhi seat par trikoniya mukaable ke asaar nahin banane paae
 a top Congress leader says, "the top leadership of the Congress has been making up its mind for a long time that under no circumstances be given the opportunity to divide the anti-bjp votes
" chhattisgarh kii jang ko is lihaaj se sirf ek rajya kaa chunaav nahin maananaa chahie
 This is an opportunity for the Congress to form a platform against the BJP at the national level by aligning with all the anti-bjp parties in the state
 '' aise main kya congress anya dalon ke saath seat bantwaare main udaartaa dikhaaegi? congress ke ek netaa bataate hai, "karnataka kaa udhaaharan sabhi ke saamne he
 In the election, the Congress fought against the JD (S)
 lekin bhaajapa ko rokane ke liye congress ne bina shart jedy (es) ko samarthan diya
 Now the time has come that there is a better option than to fight against each other in the elections, by pre-election alliance to contest against the BJP
 ''chhattisgarh vidhansabha chunaav se jaahir ho jayega ki bhaajapa virdohi manch banane main kitna safal hogi, philhal party isi disha main kaam kar rahi he
 *** agar iraadaa majboot ho to har mushkil raah aasaan ho jaati he

 Some senior Samajwadi Party leaders recently asked their president Mulayam Singh Yadav to focus on remaining in power by winning the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections in 2017
 in netaaon ne mulaayam se kaha ki wo janata parivaar ke jariye rashtriya str kii bhoomika nibhaane kii yojana ko kuch samay ke liye thande baste main daal den
 Two senior party leaders had sent this message to Mulayam before the sp's decision to part ways with the Grand Alliance in Bihar elections
 sapa main ucch padasth sutron ne kaha ki ramgopal yadav or ajam khan kaa vichaar tha ki 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi or bispi ko haraane par party kaa dhyaan hona chahie
 Sources said that the two leaders were successful in persuading Mulayam that the ambition to emerge as a force to play a bigger role in Parliament by being a part of the Janata Parivar would not serve the party's interest right now
 sapa ko pichley saal ke loksabhaa chunaav main uttar pradesh main karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha or use mahaj paanch siten mili thim
 The BJP had cleared its shrine in Uttar Pradesh
 mana jaataa he ki sapa ke in donon varisht netaaon ne mulaayam se kaha ki janata parivaar ne saath aane main ummid se zyada kaa samay liya or ab sapa pramukh ko sirf uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav jeetne par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie
 The comments sapa ke sheersh netaaon kii haalia baithak main mulaayam ne kaha ki agar maujuuda sthit bani rahi to party ko chunavi shikast kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 Mulayam had said, i am told that if the assembly elections are held now, the party will lose
 beete guuruuvaar ko sapa mahasachiv ramgopal yadav ne lakhanu main elaan kiya ki unki party mahagathbandhan se baahar nikal rahi he, kyonki siton ke bantwaare ko lekar 'apamaanit' mahasoos kar rahi he
 After this, JDU and RJD are trying to convince SP
 party ke do varisht netaaon ne bihar chunaav main mahagathbandhan se alag hone ke sapa ke faisle se pehle mulaayam ke paas yah sandesh bheja tha
 Highly placed sources in the SP said that Ram Gopal Yadav and Azam Khan were of the view that the party's focus should be on defeating the BJP and the BSP in the 2017 assembly elections
 sutron ne kaha ki donon netaa mulaayam ko is baat ke liye manaane main safal rahe ki janata parivaar kaa hissaa banakar sansad main badi bhoomika nibhaane vaali takat ke taur par ubharne kii akanksha se philhal party kaa hit nahin sadh sakegaa
 SP suffered a crushing defeat in last year's Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh and won just five seats
 bijepi ne uttar pradesh main uskaa supada saaf kar diya tha
 It is believed that these two senior SP leaders told Mulayam that the Janata Parivar took more time than expected to come together and now the SP chief should only focus on winning the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 tippaniyan In a recent meeting of top SP leaders, Mulayam said that the party would have to face electoral defeat if the current situation remains
 mulaayam ne kaha tha, mujhe bataaya gaya he ki agar abhi vidhansabha chunaav hue, to party haar jaaegi

 The Aadhaar Bill 2016 has been passed in the Lok Sabha on Friday like a money-related bill
 sansad ke nichle sadan main sattarudh bhartiya janata party ke paas khaasaa bahumat he, isliye vipaksh ne rajyasabha ke mahatv ko kam karne kii saazish kaa aarope lagaaya he
 In fact, if a bill is passed by the Lok Sabha in the form of a money-related bill, then the Upper House of Parliament or the Rajya Sabha can only discuss it, not amend it
 iske alaava rajyasabha ko dhansambandhi bill par charchaa bhi turant kerani padati he, kyonki yadi rajyasabha main pesh kiye jane ke 14 din ke bheetar charchaa nahin hoti he, to use 'paarit maan' liya jaataa he
 The comments vipaksh kaa kahana he ki sarkaar rajyasabha ko 'anaavashyak' banane kii koshish kar rahi he, kyonki vahaan vah alpamat main he, or unke liye bilon ko paarit karana kathin he
 Under the Aadhaar Bill 2016, the Unique Identification Number (sole identification number) program or 'aadhaar' will be given legal recognition, and will then be used to directly distribute subsidies and other benefits

 Apart from this, the Rajya Sabha also has to discuss the money bill immediately, because if it is not discussed within 14 days of being introduced in the Rajya Sabha, it is considered 'passed'
 tippaniyan The opposition says the government is trying to make the Rajya Sabha 'unnecessary', as it is in a minority there, and it is difficult for them to pass the bills

 desh kii sabase badi kooparative deyari amul ne farji vigyaapan ke maamle main google ko kanoonee notice bheja
 The Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) has alleged that Google earned money from fake advertisements in the name of Amul
 isamen kai farji website amul parlor or distributors ke bare main farji bijness tu bijness campan chalaate hue logon ko lut rahi thi
 Amul has alleged that Google made huge profits through these advertisements
 10 janvari ko google india ko bheje notice main amul kii taraf se kaha gaya he ki google search ingine par sitambar 2018 se kai jaalsaaj google par ped aid chalaa rahe the
 These people and organizations defrauded many Indians across the country in the name of trading opportunities with Amul and looted their hard earned money
 in jaalsaajon dwaara is farjivade main amul parlor, amul distributor or amul frenchiji jaise kai kiward kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 Amul says that putting these keywords in Google search causes many fake links
 jis par clic karne par logon se ek form bharvaya jaataa he
 After which a call comes to them and they are asked for registration fees ranging from Rs 25000 to Rs 5 lakh
 ek baar paisa jamaa hone ke baad in logon ke saath kisi bhi tarah kaa sampark or sanchaar band ho jaataa he
 Amul has raised the matter with Google India, demanding that such fake advertisements be discontinued, saying that those who give them before the advertisements related to the well-known companies should be seriously investigated
 amul ne is sambandh main copirite se jude sabhi kanoonee dastavej or vibhinn utpaadon ke naam google ko jamaa karaae hai
 All this was done under the direction of Google India team so that in the future, traps will not be misused by Google search ad based on Amul keyword
 is jaalsaji ko lekar logon ko jaagruk karne ke liye amul ne google search par ek abhiyaan bhi chalaaya he taaki upabhoktaaon ko is tarah ke farji campan se aagaah kiya ja sake or is abhiyaan ko samarpit ek webpej bhi banaaya he

 kendriya mantri smriti irani ne shanivaar ko mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav or unki party par karaara waar kiya
 Describing the Samajwadi Party as the 'protector of rapists', he said that his five-year rule will be known only for crimes against women
 vah samuhik balaatkaar tathaa ek mahila evam uski naaballig beti se balaatkaar kii koshish ke maamalon ke silsile main varisht sapa mantri gayatri prajapati ke khilaaf aaj darj kii gai praathmiki kaa zikr kar rahi thim
 Irani said at several election meetings here, "it is a matter of great shame that Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's cabinet has persons like Gayatri Prajapati who are accused of rape
" yah baat ki adaalat ko dakhal dena padaa or aadesh dena padaa ki mantri ke khilaaf praathmiki darj kii jaae, sabit karti he ki sapa balaatkaariyon kii rakshak he
 Kei is not surprised that the women of Uttar Pradesh never felt safe under her rule
 " ucchtam nyaayalay ne kal police ko prajapati ke khilaaf maamla darj karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 Prajapati is a senior leader in the ruling SP
 purv bhaajapa rashtriya upaadhyaksh irani ne kaha, "sapa kaa paanch saal kaa shashan keval mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadhon, jameen hathiyaane kii dheron ghatnaon or gangstaron ko khuli chhot milane ke liye yaad kiya jayega
 "smriti alleged that when the Chief Minister went to Amethi to address the first public meeting, he told the public for a minister (gayatri Prajapati) surrounded by allegations of illegal mining that this minister is very important for him to win it
 isse pataa chalata he ki mukhyamantri pradesh se bhrashtachar or aparaadh khatm karne ke prati bilkul gambhir nahin he
 The Chief Minister's statement that there was an increase of injustice and corruption due to uncle (shivpal Yadav) is wrong
 unase poocha gaya ki congress-sapa gathbandhan se bhaajapa main khalabali much gai he, is par irani ne kaha ki bhaajapa main koi khalabali nahin he
 Akhilesh was not confident of winning alone in Uttar Pradesh, so he joined the Congress
 aaj jagah-jagah poster lage he ki upi ko yah saath pasand he lekin unhen maaloom hua ki kanpur main hi do siton (kaint or maharaajapur) par sapa or congress ke pratyaashee ek duusare ko pasand nahin he or aamane saamne chunaav lard rahe he to phir upi ko yah saath kaise pansad aayega
 The comments unase poocha gaya ki basapa supremon mayawati kah rahi he ki bhartiya janata party unke khilaaf afvaah failaa rahi he ki basapa or bhaajapa mil kar sarkaar bana rahi he
 Irani said that she only wants to remain in the news
 basapa ke prati bhaajapa ke man main koi narmi nahin he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party is forming an absolute majority government in Uttar Pradesh
 irani se poocha gaya ki agar uttar pradesh main bhaajapa kii sarkaar banati he to kya vah mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa hongi
 Just said that every BJP worker and people of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand want BJP government in the state
 irani ne yahaan kai chunavi sabhaaon main kaha, "yah badi shame kii baat he ki mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke mantrimandal main gayatri prajapati jaise vyakti hai jo balaatkaar ke aaropee hai
 The fact that the court had to intervene and order that an FIR be lodged against the minister proves that the SP is the protector of rapists
 kei aashcharya nahin he ki uske shashan main uttar pradesh kii mahilaon ne kabhi surakshit mahasoos nahin kiya
 "the Supreme Court yesterday directed the police to register a case against Prajapati
 prajapati sattarudh sapa main varisht netaa hai
 Former BJP national vice-president Irani said, "the sp's five-year rule will be remembered only for crimes against women, numerous incidents of land grabbing, and the free rein to gangsters
 " smriti ne aarope lagaaya ki mukhyamantri jab pehali jansabha ko sambodhit karne amethi gayi to unhone avaidh khanan ke aaropon se ghire ek mantri (gayatri prajapati) ke liye janata se kaha ki yah mantri unke liye bahut jaruri he ise jarur jitaana
 This shows that the Chief Minister is not at all serious about ending corruption and crime from the state
 mukhyamantri kaa yah kahana ki chachaa (shivpal yadav) kii vajah se anyaay or bhrashtachar kii badhottaree hui yah kahana galat he
 He was asked that the congress-sp alliance had created panic in the BJP, to which Irani said that there is no panic in the BJP
 akhilesh ko uttar pradesh main akele jeetne par bharosa nahin tha isaliye unhone congress kaa saath liya
