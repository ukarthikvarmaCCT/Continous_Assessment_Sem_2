 Graeme Kramer and Chamu Chibhabha were the heroes of Zimbabwe's first T20 win over India
 ajey lautne kaa sapana tutis jeet ke saath hi zimbabwe ne bharat ke zimbabwe se avijit lautne ke sapane ko bhi tod diya
 After winning the toss, Zimbabwe came out to bat for the first time in the series, scoring 145 for seven wickets thanks to Chamu Chibhabha's 51-ball 67
 zimbabwe kaa saamaanya sa score bhi bharat ke liye pahaad jaisaa ban gaya
 Easily lost wickets: Indian batsmen easily lost their wickets, allowing the team to reach 135 runs for nine wickets
 bharat ke liye robin uthppa ne sarvaadhik 42 ran banaae
 For Zimbabwe, spinner Graeme Kramer took three wickets for 18 runs in four overs
 isse pehle bharat ne is daure ke teenon ekadivasiy match jeetne kaa baad pehle tii20 main bhi aasaan jeet darj kii thi
 Bad batting defeated Indian batsmen responsible for this defeat of India, who were seen battling in front of spinners
 bharat ne 12 ran ke andar chaar wicket ganvaae jo aakhir main match kaa terning point sabit hua
 The win is Zimbabwe's first win over India in the last five years and the only win in T20 International
 lakshya kaa peechha karne utari bhartiya pari kii shuruuaat acchhee nahin rahi or usne pehle over main hi captain ajinkya rahane kaa wicket ganvaa diya jo ki teji se ran churaane ke prayaas main ran out hue
 Uthappa played a fast innings, Uthappa, who came to the crease after the first wicket fell, adopted a strategy to dominate the bowlers
 ek vakt tha jab uthppa or vijay khel rahe the to lag rahaa tha ki bharat aasaani se jeet darj kar legaa
 Troubled by this partnership, Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza made frequent changes to the bowling but Uthappa easily brought the boundary balls to Taurai Mujarbani, Chris Pofu and Chibhabha
 murali vijay ne bhi haath kholte hue seen williams par pari kaa ekmaatr chakka jamaaya
 The sixth bowling change in the first seven overs fell to Zimbabwe soon and India lost 69 for five from 57 for one wicket in consecutive overs
 leg spinner greem krimar ne pari ke saatven over main gend sanbhali or unhone pehle vijay (11 gend par 13 ran) kaa of stump ukhada or phir nae ballebaaj manish pandey ko khaataa kholane kaa mauka die bina pagabaadha out kiya
 Uthappa increased India's woes by handing an easy catch back to Williams in the next over
 bharat kii taraf se aakhri vanade main naabad shatak jadne vaale kedaar jadhav bhi sankat ke samay badi pari nahin khel paae or keval paanch ran banaakar ran out ho gaye
 Pressure victims Binnystuart Binny (24 runs off 23 balls) and Sanju Samson (19 runs off 24 balls) prevented the wicket falling for a while but due to increased pressure on the net run rate, Binny lost patience and benefitted from Kramer
 Who got India’s problems with his third wicket in the form of Binny
 bharat ko aakhri teen overon main 32 ranon kii darkaar thi or iskaa puraa daaromadar apana pehla international tii20 match khel rahe yuva samson par tha lekin vah pophu kii gend seemaa rekha paar ke pahunchane ke prayaas main seemaa rekha par kaich thama baithe
 Patel, who lost four wickets in the last five overs, was also caught on the boundary in an attempt to play big shots
 bharat ne aakhri paanch over main keval 30 ran banane ke saath chaar wicket ganvaae
 Apart from Chibhabha, only two other Zimbabwean batsmen, Hamilton Mascadja (19 runs off 17 balls) and Sean Williams (17 runs off 18 balls) reached double digits

 The pictures of women suffering from acid in the calendar make them realize their dreams which have been scorched by this horrific attack
 yah tasviren antarrashtriya khyatipraapt photographer rahul sahaaran ne khinchi hai

 - input language gangaajal, prakaash jha or bihar ke rajanetaaon ke bich hameshaa se chhattis kaa aankada rahaa he
 No one knows this truth better than Prakash Jha himself
 haalanki unki har film release se pehle kisi na kisi vajah se vivaad main rahati hai, jisase film ko publicity bhi acchhee-khaasi mil jaati hai, lekin prakaash jha kii nai film jai gangaajal ko unke apane grih rajya bihar or is baar rashtriya janata dal nahin balki bhartiya janata party ke netaaon kii naaraazgi kaa shikaar hona par rahaa hai
 Actually, the villains in Prakash Jha's new film are mlas from Bankipur constituency
 or ye sanyog he ki bankipur naam se bihar main, wo bhi rajdhani patna main ek vidhansabha kshetra he, jiske vidhayak bijepi netaa nitin naveen hai
 Nitin has been representing the region for two times and his image has improved, but Nitin Naveen fears that this film will adversely affect his image
 isliye ve chaahate hai ki yaa to film se bankipur kaa naam hataaya jaae yaa film kaa pradarshan roka jaae
 At the same time, Prakash Jha says that the background of this film is not from Bihar and the uniform of Priyanka Chopra in this film also has the badge of Madhya Pradesh Police
 lihaaja, nitin naveen kii ashanka bevajaah he
 Prakash Jha claims that he did not enter this name to offend anyone
 vahiin, nitin naveen kaa aarope he ki jha ne durbhaavna se prerit hokar bankipur ke naam kaa istemaal kiya he
 He says that Bankipur is the only assembly constituency in the entire country, which is in Bihar and from here he is a two-time MLA
 tippaniyan Experts believe that the BJP is aggressive on this issue, as Prakash Jha has lost the last Lok Sabha election from Janata Dal United to Bettiah
 isse purv bhi unhone 2009 kaa loksabhaa chunaav bhi lok janashakti party kii tikat par ladaa tha or donon baar unhen haar kaa muh dekhnaa padaa tha
 On the release of the film Gangajal in 2003, Rashtriya Janata Dal opposed it on the grounds that the villain's name in that film is Sadhu Yadav and Sadhu is brother of the then Chief Minister Rabri Devi
 baad main sadhu ke karibiyon ne film dekhne ke baad use bihar main release karne kii anumati di thi, lekin virodh ke kaaran mili publicity kii vajah se gangaajal hit rahi thi
 However, when Jha made a film called Reservation a few years ago, she could not pull the audience into the theater
 darasal, prakaash jha kii nai film main jo khalanaayak hai wo bankipur vidhansabha kshetra ke vidhayak hai
 And it is a coincidence that in Bihar by the name of Bankipur, it is also an assembly constituency in the capital Patna, whose MLA is BJP leader Nitin Naveen
 nitin do baar se is kshetra kaa pratinidhiv kar rahe hai or unki chhavi saafe sudhari he, lekin nitin naveen ko dar he ki is film se unki chhavi par pratikul asar padegaa
 So they want either Bankipur's name to be removed from the film or the film's performance be stopped
 vahiin, prakaash jha kaa kahana he ki is film kii prishthbhumi bihar kii nahin he or is film main priyanka chopra kii vardi par bhi madhya pradesh police kaa baij he
 Hence, the apprehension of Nitin Naveen is needless
 prakaash jha daawa he ki unhone kisi ko thes pahunchane ke liye ye naam nahin daalaa
 At the same time, Nitin Naveen alleges that Jha has used Bankipur's name, inspired by maliciousness
 unka kahana he ki puure desh main bankipur ekmaatr vidhansabha kshetra he, joki bihar main he or yahaan se wo do baar vidhayak hai
 The comments jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki bijepi is mudde par aakraamak he, kyonki prakaash jha janata dal united se pichhlaa loksabhaa chunaav betia se haar chuke hai
 Earlier, he had also contested the 2009 Lok Sabha election on Lok Janshakti Party ticket and both times he had to face defeat
 saal 2003 main gangaajal film ke release hone par rashtriya janata dal ne iskaa is aadhaar par virodh kiya tha ki us film main khalanaayak kaa naam sadhu yadav he or sadhu us samay kii mukhyamantri rabari devi ke bhai hai
 Later, the monks were allowed to release her in Bihar after watching the film, but Gangajal was a hit due to the publicity it received due to the protest
 haalanki kuch varshon purv jab jha ne aarakshan naamak film banaai to vah darshakon ko theatre main nahin khinch pai
 At the same time, Prakash Jha says that the background of this film is not from Bihar and the uniform of Priyanka Chopra in this film also has the badge of Madhya Pradesh Police

 ek five star hotel kaa cameraa, kamare main soti hui ek ladki or kamare main latakati ek noujvaan kii laash
 When the girl wakes up to sleep, she is surprised to see her friend's corpse swinging on the noose as her friend was alive when she slept, but what happened in a few hours that the young man in the room committed suicide 
 kamare main mahila mitra thi maujuudguruuvaar kii shamhotlaratison blue ke cameraa number 426 se jaise hi ek noujvaan ladke kii khudakushi kii khabar ai to puure hotel main afra- tafari fail gai
 It did not take long for the police to identify the deceased
 25 saal ke abhishek kaa taalluk dilli ke ek kaarobaari gharaane se tha, or uskilashhotel ke kamare main ek warderob se latakati hui mili thi
 It was also learned from the eyewitnesses that along with Abhishek, his girlfriend was also present in his room
 khudakushi or hatya ke bich atka maamlahotal ke record se yahi khulaasa hua ki abhishek ne 15 taarikh kii dopaher do baje hotel kii dasvin manzil ke cameraa number 426 main chekain kiya tha
 He was accompanied by his girlfriend at the time
 guuruuvaar kii dopaher donon ne khaanaa khaaya, or apane kamare main chale gaye
 About six o'clock in the evening, Abhishek's lady friend informed the hotel staff about this suicide
 abhishek kii maut kii khabar uske gharavaalon tak bhi pahunchi or jab un logon ne hotel ke kamare ko apni ankhon se dekha to khudakushi kii baat se inkaar kar kuch aise sawaal khadey kar die, jisase maamla khudakushi or hatya ke bich jaakar atak gaya
 The questions raised by the family, the questions raised by Abhishek's family also cannot be ignored because the room, the circumstances and where the body of Abhishek was found
 unhen dekh kar nahin lagata ki abhishek ne khudakushi kii hogi
 According to sources, Abhishek committed suicide by hanging himself from the belt of the gown, but the moment Abhishek hanged, his female friend was present in the room and according to his statement the time Abhishek committed suicide
 gale se nahin utarati khudakushi kii batagharawaalon ke mutabik abhishek kaa vajan kareeb 100 kilo se zyada he
 In such a situation, hanging from the belt of a gown does not bring the issue of suicide and that is also because the wardrobe from which hanging has come to the fore
 usamen koi aisa kunda yaa hook nahin tha jisamen belt kaa sira fansaaya ja sake
 There is also a question that at the time when Abhishek must have hanged his neck and suffocated, his hands and feet have hit the ground or wardrobe and it can be so loud that it can be heard easily in the room
 postmortem report dekh police bhi hairaanpahali najar main abhishek kii maut police ko bhi khudakushi hi lag rahi thi lekin jab postmortem report ai to police bhi hairaan rah gai
 The post mortem report revealed that Abhishek died of strangulation
 abhishek ne aatmahatya nahin kii or agar abhishek ne aatmahatya nahin kii to phir uski maut ke liye koun jimmedaar he
 The post mortem report revealed that Abhishek died due to strangulation
 police kii shuruaati tafteesh main ye baat saamne ai he ki abhishek or uski mahila mitra ek duusare ko lambey samay se jaanate hai or donon kii nazdikiyon kii khabar mahila ke pati ko bhi thi
 On October 3, she left her husband's house and she was living in her maternal home
 mahila kaa pati bhi abhishek ko acchhee tarah se jaanata tha or aksar abhishek uske ghar aata tha
 According to the woman's husband Kulbir, people had seen both of them walking together many times and they told him about it
 kulbir kii maane to usne kai baar abhishek ko samajhaayaa or uske gharavaalon se bhi apni patni or abhishek ke bare main zikr kiya, lekin donon kaa milanaa julna kam nahin hua
 If the friend of the woman's friend threatened Bulkulbir, after Abhishek's death, his wife called him and told that Abhishek had cheated on her
 usne pehle use hotel main bulaayaa or phir khudakushi kar lee
 On the other hand, Abhishek's family are accused of killing him on Kulbir, his wife and his brother-in-law
 unke mutabik kuch vakt pehle hi kulbir ne dhamkee di thi ki wo abhishek yaa uske bhai chiraag ko maar daalega
 Ghaziabad Police has registered a case of murder and Abhishek's female friend is asking for the inheritance after the police report came to light
 police hotel ke sisitivi kii bhi jaanch kar rahi he taaki pataa lagaaya ja sake ki hotel main rahane ke dauraan abhishek ke kamare main koun-koun aayaa tha
 Police has also sent Abhishek's viscera for investigation
 ek paanch sitara hotel main hui is maut ne police ko ulajhaa kar rakh diya he
 The police will interrogate the female friend as well as her husband and her brother so that Abhishek's death can be solved

 Rajya Sabha MP from Gujarat, Smriti Irani, was accused by Chavda, 'smriti Irani and her staff forced the officer to award the contract to the Sharda Mazur Kamdar Cooperative Circle
 '
 
 
 This also violated the norm that contracts worth more than ₹ 50 lakh cannot be awarded to one group under the PMLAD scheme
 This cooperative got work contracts worth many times above prescribed limit

 fifa vishwa cap ke 21wein sanskaran ke pehle quarter final main do baar kii vijeta urugve kaa saamana 1998 kii vijeta france se hoga
 Both the in-form teams will be trying to make it to the semi-finals at the Nizhny Novgorod Stadium
 france or urugve donon quarter final main diggaj khilaadiyon kii tiimon ko haraakar ai hai
 Uruguay defeated Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal in the pre-quarter-finals, while France defeated Lionel Messi's Argentina to keep their title campaign alive
 yah match ek tareeke se donon tiimon ke majboot dephence kii pariksha hogi
 The battle between the two teams, full of confidence, is expected to be exciting
 urugve ne abhi tak ek bhi match nahin ganvaaya he or sirf ek gol khaaya he
 At the same time, France has also been invincible, but has played the first draw of this World Cup so far
 chotil kavani ko sahaara dete ronaldourugve ke liye sabase badi chintaa yah he ki portugal ke khilaaf do gol karne vaale uske striker edinson kavani chotil hai
 He suffered an injury in the pre-quarterfinals and therefore had to go off the field
 vah quarter final main khelenge yaa nahin is par abhi andeh he
 The choice of coach Oscar Tabrez will be difficult for him
 kavani ke na hone se urugve ko ek nakusaan yah bhi he ki team ke sabase bade khilaadi louis suarej kaa asardaar jodidar match main nahin hoga, jo suarej ko kamjor bhi kar saktaa he
 In the last match, Kavani scored goals with the help of Suarez
 yah jodi ishaare bhar main vipakshi team kii naak ke neeche se gol kar jaati he
 At the same time, the French defense kept a player like Messi tied, scoring a goal, but after that he could not play openly
 france main samuel umthiti, rafel varan ke upar urugve ke atake ko rokna tedi kheer sabit ho saktaa he
 One of the concerns for France in this match is who she will field in place of Blasé Matuidi, who will not be able to play this match due to suspension

 ) haalanki shalab kumaar aagaamee kaarykram ko muslim virdohi kaarykram ke rup main dekhne se inkaar karte hai
 "truly Trump is not completely anti-muslim," he says
 vah to unke profiling (sampurna jaankaree) kii baat karte hai taaki unka (muslimon) profile taiyaar kiya jaae
 However, this is not particularly the case with India because we do not see India as a place from which terrorists originate
 ''tippaniyan Along with this, this group has also given a significant amount of money for Republican candidates
 shalab kumaar ne NDTV ko bataaya, ''ham abhi tak 1
 Has raised $ 5 million
 '' According to the organizer, the program will also feature film stars Prabhu Deva, Andhra actor Ram Charan, Sophie Chaudhary and Shreya Sharan along with Trump
 haalanki ye to spasht nahin he ki trump kii raily ke baad bhartiya america matadaataaon kaa rukh unki taraf kya hoga lekin ek hi raily main donald trump or prabhu deva kii upasthiti dekhne laayak baat hogi

 But, Shalabh Kumar, the convener of the event told NDTV, "we have found that they are interested in Hindu American Society and India because they have invested in India
" '' When asked why only Indian Hindus, Chicago businessman Shalabh Kumar, a staunch supporter of the Republican Party, said that Trump actually shares Hindu values like "family values and financial discipline"

 ) However, Shalabh Kumar refuses to see the upcoming program as an anti-muslim program
 vah kehete hai, ''vastav main trump puri tarah se muslim virdohi nahin hai
 He talks about his profiling (complete information) so that his (muslims) profile can be prepared

 # abhishekchaubey's film makes social commentary and how— Urmimala Banerjee (@urmisworld)february 28, 2019mind =blown ,what a nuanced display of casteism and patriarchal society
 Penned down with out of the box 'screenplay' and hardcore desi performances, # Sonchiriyais meant for raw and fierce lovers! 
 This might get limited patronage but will win hearts 
 Going with 4 / 5 stars

 So sensitive, so brutal, such a finely observed critique of patriarchy and our caste system - # Sonchiriyais not to be missed

 Jaideep, who became an audience favorite with the hit hockey film Chak De India, always presents new ideas and scripts in his films
 raaket singh main unhone ek celsman ke saamne aane vaali samasyaon or utaar chadhaav ko likhaa he
 The film tells what a salesman in cities has to do to prove himself
 ‘chak de india’ ke alaava aajaa nachle, khosla kaa ghosla, banty or bubbly, company or jangal jaisi filmon se baliwood ko mahatvapurn yogadan de chuke jayadeep ne kaha, ‘‘main hameshaa hi yarthathwaadee filmein banane ke haq main hum kyonki ye darshakon ke dil ko chhukar hit hoti hai
 "jaideep, fond of reading books, said," a salesman is the protagonist in this film
 celsman par puri film banane ke bare main kisi ne nahin sochaa hoga, lekin mujhe pataa tha ki main ise dilachasp bana saktaa hum
 When asked how the idea of making a film on salesmen came up, he said, "I have made this film keeping in mind the multiplex audience in the metro
" ‘marketing or cells’ aajkal charchit vishay hai, lekin is vishay par koi film nahin likhi gayi jabaki sabko pataa he ki ek celsman kaa kaam kitna mushkil hota he

 i have tried to tell about this
 ’’aaj bhi zyaadaatar samay kitaaben padhane vaale jayadeep ne kaha, ‘‘celsman banane ke liye jaruri nahin he ki aap kaaphi achche skool kalege main padhe hon, lekin aapke andar khud ko sabit karne kii bhukh honi chahie
 i try to make similar films that are hits, because only after being hit, you get further work
 ’’ jayadeep ne khud ko sirf lekhan tak hi simit nahin rakhaa he balki vah nirmaan or sangeet main bhi haath aajamaa chuke hai
 But only one book brought him to Bollywood
 aadhunik filmein rachane vaale jayadeep hajaar se zyada baar mahabharat or ramayana pard chuke hai or in donon main unhen mahabharat zyada behatar lagati he
 He said, "do not read them for righteousness, but the fact is that there is no better 'storyteller' book than these two
 ise padhate hue aapako ram or krishna najar aane lagate hai
 Jaideep said that a book named 'screenplay of Gandhi' took him to Bollywood
 unhone kaha, ‘‘is kitaab ko padhakar laga ki main filmon main likh saktaa hum or maine apni ‘do takia kii naukari’ ko chhodkar baliwood kii ore ruukh kiya
 "asked how the success and failure of films affect them," he said, "when the film succeeds, it gives satisfaction

 'jena kept informing Alagiri about these messes from her letters constantly but Alagiri continued to ignore them
 alaagiri ne kabhi in ghotaalon ko rokane ke liye koi mahatvapurn kadam nahin uthaae
 On 17 July 2012, Jena wrote, 'the government passes subsidy for the benefit of farmers so that the retail price remains at a reasonable level
 lekin nijee company apane mutabik kisaanon ke liye keemten tay kar rahi hai or anuchit laabh uthaa rahi he
 In such a situation, subsidy has no meaning
 isi note main jena ne yah jaankaree di ki urvarak company kisno ke liye jari hone vaale kul sabsidi kaa ek tihaai hissaa apane paas rakhti he
 Jenna also offered strong evidence of this
 3 agast 2012 jena ne phir ek patr likhaa, 'companiyaan urvarkon ko ucch keemton main bechakar bahut adhik munafa kama rahi he
 He again gave the same information that subsidy of four to five thousand rupees per metric tone of DAP and subsidy of six thousand rupees on complex fertilizer is going to private companies
 jena ne in companiyon ke acount ke jaanch kii bhi maang kii
 Jena said that the department should have taken immediate corrective action but no action was taken by Alagiri
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki diemke netaa ko in companiyon ke khilaaf karrwai ke liye koun si baat roak rahi thi? kya mantralay ke bina madad ke companiyon kaa yah munafa kamaane kaa kaam chal paata? jena ke patron kii shrinkhalaa kaa alaagiri par koi asar nahin hua or is mudde par unhone koi uchit karrwai nahin kii
 While highways and farmers dams are built with tax money from common people, some farmers also commit suicide due to rising prices of fertilizers
 jena ne varsh 2012 kii shuruyaat main adhikariyon dwaara paarit kuch order kaa khulaasa bhi algiri ke saamne kiya tha
 In this, the association with private companies of the Ministry was clearly exposed, but in spite of this Alagiri kept quiet
 kai company adhik sabsidi lene ke liye urvarak ko bazaar main bevakt utaar detii thi
 Once fertilizer came into the market, the company would be ready to take subsidy again
 jena ne is baat kii jaankaree bhi vibhaag ko di ki company is yojana ke tahat adhik sabsidi lene kaa jugad kar rahi he jise anumati nahin milani chahie
 But it had no effect on the department and repeated orders were passed
 19 march ke likhe patr main jena ne jaankaree di ki 'urvarak industry kheti ke sahi samay par kisaanon ko urvarak uplabdh nahin karvaa paa rahi he
 There is a black market of fertilizer before time, which is increasing the burden on the farmers and the government is suffering
 ' is baar bhi jena kii koshishen bekaar gayi or puure maamle par koi uchit karrwai nahin kii gai
 According to the junior minister, the government claimed higher subsidy rates in 2011-12 when fertilizer is not needed
 vipaksh vaise bhi algiri ko anupasthit mantri ke rup main leti he
 Alagiri is accused of never attending cabinet meetings nor participating in important functions of the ministry
 hedlins today kii vishesh jaanch se yah dikhataa he ki alaagiri mantralay ko apni jaagir ke hisaab se chalaa rahe hai
 Dieting done for the sake of the body can also cause a bad odor from the mouth
 shodhakartaaon kaa kahana he ki khaane ke kram main kami se munh main banane vaali laar kii maatra prabhavit hoti he, jabaki durgandh paidaa karne vaale tatwon ko dur karne ke liye laar bahut upyogi hoti he
 Dentist Dr
 Madhu Ghai says that bad odor is a common problem and many of us suffer from it, but most do not realize that it comes from bad mouth
 baharhaal, bheed main jane par yaa logon se milane par yadi munh se durgandh aae, to behad sharmindagi kii sthiti utpann ho jaati he
 She says it is not that this problem is incurable
 niyamit antaraal main pani pine se is samasya se kaaphi had tak chhutkaaraa mil saktaa he
 It is very important to clean teeth after eating anything, but unfortunately in our country people do not understand this thing
 dieting bhi munh se durgandh aane kaa ek kaaran hoti he, kyonki lambey samay tak kuch na khaane se munh main banane vaali laar kii maatra kam ho jaati he
 Whereas saliva is very important to remove the odor causing elements
 ek anya danta rog visheshgy dow rakesh sharma kehete hai, dieting karne waalon ko chahie ki ve iske nuksaandaayak pahaluon ko bhi dekhen
 Mouth odor can be avoided by consuming at least liquid food in regular order, if not solid
 nachuropeeth dow kasee garg kehete hai ki behad maamuli si saavdhaanee se munh kii durgandh se bachaa ja saktaa he
 After eating, some particles of food remain in the mouth, due to which it is not cleaned, bacteria gets collected there and then it starts to smell
 laar kii kami bhi durgandh kaa kaaran banati he
 Tobacco products are the main cause of bad mouth odor
 iske alaava bronchitis, madhumeh, synucitis, pet kii samasya, jigar yaa gurde kii samasya ke kaaran bhi munh se durgandh aa sakati he
 This, he says, is not an incurable problem
 thode se upaay se iskaa samaadhaan nikal saktaa he
 But first of all it is important to pay attention to teeth cleaning
 dow ghai kahati hai, dieting karne waalon ko agar munh kii durgandh se bachanaa ho, to unhen niyamit antaraal ke baad taral aahaar lete rahanaa chahie, taaki laar granthi kii karypranali baadhit na hone paae or munh main durgandh paidaa karne vaale tatwon ko dur karne ke liye jaruri laar kaa utpaadan hota rahe

 rahul gandhi ne raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki ham modi ji kii tarah maid in india nahin maid in saharanpur banaaenge, ham lakdi ke vyapaariyon ke liye nae avasar lekar aaenge
 Rahul Gandhi said that we are fighting against the forces dividing the country and such forces that work to divide the country and fight people among themselves will have to be taught a lesson
 rahul ne kaha ki ham chaahate hai ki jaise bihar main modi ji ko waapas bheja tha vaise hi ham uttar pradesh se bhi waapas bhej den, isiilie ab modi ji bihar kii baat nahin karte hai
 Rahul said that Modi ji used to wear suits first, but when we gave a speech on suit-boot in Parliament, he stopped wearing the suit
 tippaniyan Keeping in mind the sp-congress alliance, Akhilesh and Rahul are holding a common rally in different places in UP
 haal hi main unhone agra or lakhanu main saath milakar jansabha ko sambodhit kiya he
 Let us know that elections are to be held in 7 phases for all 403 assembly seats in UP
 11 farvari ko pehle charan kaa chunaav he
 All parties have put their full strength in UP
 jahaan upi kaa chunaav mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke liye unki saakh kaa sawaal he vahiin congress jo pichley 27 saalon se upi main satta se baahar he uske liye bhi ye chunaav behad ahm he

 Whenever we are fed up with anger and apprehension due to lack of solutions and ideas in dealing with a problem and gradually lose self-confidence as a result, we have only one recipe left in the end: restriction on something Apply it jis tarah samachar channelon par prime time kaa sabase lokapriy vaakya 'desh jaananaa chahta he’ ban chukaa he, thik usee tarj par aisa jaan padataa he goyaa kisi sankat main laachaari ke vakt 'desh pratibandh chahta he’ is desh kaa rashtriya samaadhaan-vaakya he
 i am neither copying nor raising any demand by saying so
 yah bas ek tathy he ki pratibandh har samasya se nibatane kaa hamaara pasandida nuskhaa ban chukaa he
 Leaders do not talk less than this
 sadakon par utraa peshewar krantikari itnaa sunate hi santusht ho uthta he, kyonki use to bas apane tamagon ke bich sajaane ke liye kisi kaa sir chahie tha
 And the common man, of course, keeps clapping despite not understanding anything
 iskaa apwaad akele dilli kii vah aam aurat he jo pratibandhon kii fehrist main pichley hafte kii hamaari taaja sanak par avivekpurna tareeke se tali nahin peet rahi, kyonki isse uski aazaadee or vikalpon kaa hanan hua he jabaki uski suraksha badhaane ke naam par ham ek kadam bhi aage nahin bad paae hai
 It would be useful to remember the events in a sequence
 sabase pehle dilli police taxi seva sanchaalak company ubar ko jaanch main madad karne ke liye notice bhejti he
 Criticism of her failure grows, so she bans Uber
 phir kai log is par hansane lagate hai jabaki dilli kii khaskar kaamkaaji mahilaayein ubal padati hai
 Many other services are then banned including Ola, Quick, Delhi Cab
 agar aapane moorkhtaaen karne kaa faisla kar hi liya he to behatar he ki santulan banaae rakhen
 Such a decision has pushed the growing population of working women in Delhi back five years and left them on the mercy of black and yellow cars
 yaad karen ve din jab aap dilli hawaii adde yaa railway stesan par police nigaraanee vaale boothon se pre-ped texiyaan liya karte the or agali seat par saath main ek chele ko baithaae hue driver bich raste main gaadi roak kar paise badhaane kii maang karata tha
 At first, he would start his conversation with the familiar story of expensive petrol and if you were not impressed then he would come down on the threat
 sochie ki agar aap apane parivaar ke saath raat main safar kar rahe hon to yah kitna bhayaavah hoga
 And then a single woman? Well Uber still has many answers to his irresponsibility and negligence in the driver's investigation, but first ban him, then FIR on him for fraud under Section 420 of IPC
 Entering and finally putting the rest in its wraps and then putting the restrictions on it can only be an Indian job
 grih mantri rajnath singh ne duusare rajyon or shaharon main bhi cab companiyon par pratibandh lagane kii baat kah daali he
 Such a childish reaction if former Maharashtra Home Minister R
 aar
 It would have come from a prankster like Patil, who has spent an entire decade trying to ban Mumbai's dance bars and ultimately failed while under his nose, when he entered the city of lashkar-e-taiba, he said to us Appealed to be patient that such small things happen in big cities
 hairat kii baat he ki aisi pratikriya kaaphi anbhavi or samajhadaar rajnath singh kii ore se ai he jo desh ke sabase bade rajya ke mukhyamantri rah chuke hai
 He may have been hoping that by doing so the attention of his ministry in the case of the Maoist attack in Sukma last week could be deflected
 ho saktaa he ki main apni baat ko kuch zyada lanbaa khinch le gaya, lekin isamen koi shaq nahin he ki isse unke maatahat aane vaale sabase chaalaak vibhaag dilli police ko samasya kii jad se dhyaan hataane main jarur madad mili he
 The root of the problem is how a no-objection certificate was given to a man accused of rape in the past
 is maamle main jo vyapak traasadee he vah thik do saal pehle ghati 16 disambar kii ghatana jaisi he—baat yah honi chahie thi ki saarvajanik sthalon or suvidhaon ko mahilaon ke liye surakshit kaise banaaya jaae jabaki yah baat kabhi hui hi nahin
 The whole debate rested on retaliatory action - cast the criminal, hang him publicly
 is bahes se ek adhakachare kism kaa nayaa balaatkaar nirodhak kanoon bhi nikal kar aa gaya
 Now the whole story has shifted to 'foreign-owned' taxi services
 agar yahi giroh nae sire se taxi sevaaon ko license jari karne ja rahaa he, to behatar he ki mahilaayein suraj dhalane ke baad gharon main rahane kii taiyaari kar len yaa thok main kaali mirch kaa spray kharid daalen
 Our system is faced with restrictions
 kisi bhi khalis loktantr ke mukaable ham kahin zyada chizon par bandish lagaate hai
 Be it a book, a film, an advertisement, a game or an extra taxi service, no one seems to mind that we ban it
 ham pehle to aise jatil kanoonee va niamak dhaanche banaate hai ki koi bina gire chal hi na paae
 You can ask Amway, the retailing company — whose American CEO has spent some time in jail in Andhra — or ask the latest gleaming e-commerce companies
 ye companiyaan arabon kii videshi puunji juta rahi hai, lekin hamaare yahaan kehane ko multibrands ritel ab bhi gaiyr-kanoonee he
 The only delay is that who puts out a domestic PIL against them
 yaa phir or aasaan yah hoga ki kahin kisi puliciye kaa dimag thanak jaae- main ummid karata hum ki aisa bangaloru main nahin hoga- or vah inhen kanoon todgaye par giraftaar kar le
 These thugs run by foreign money will definitely be banned
 main yah likhte vakt ahmedabad ke hawaii adde par baitha apane vimaan kaa intjaar kar rahaa hum, lihaaja sharaab par yahaan lagi bahuprachaarit bandish ke bare main baat karnaa maujuun hoga
 Why is this? Mahatma Gandhi was born on the soil of Gujarat, so no one can drink alcohol here
 desh ke baaki hisson main koi dikkat nahin he jahaan rashtrapita ke sava arab bachche rahete hai
 Someone tell me how successful it is here
 aap kisi gujarati se puch kar dekhie, khaskar apane taxi driver se, vah fouran samasya-samaadhaan par pahunch jayega
 My driver says, "sir, there is a ban on alcohol, but little on its smuggling
" ” main bahari hum, to main permit bhi le saktaa hum
 Assume that the entire economy of week-recovery works around these permits in Gujarat
 phir, pratibandh kaa ulanghan karke pine kaa majaa hi kuch or hota hoga
 It came here in 1974
 es
 i remember that funny song from Johar's film 5 Rifles: Ever since the government broke prohibition, believe it or not we quit drinking
 morarji desai ke saudi arab kii tarj par lagaai gai bandishon ke baad mumbai saamaanya sthiti main laut rahi thi, tab ke halaat par yah geet likhaa gaya tha
 We normally do all such things which are restricted
 masalan, aap railway stesan par tasviren nahin utaar sakate, hawaii adde ko to bhul hi jaaen
 The law does not allow publishing of maps of any part of the country, except some basic details or the larger size of existing maps
 main aage jo kehane ja rahaa hum usamen thodi saavdhaanee baratani hogi
 You see how the Honorable Supreme Court is getting entangled in the exercise of making Indian cricket clean and clean, while the health of this game is good enough both in terms of performance and money
 ham ekadivasiy or tii-20 ranking main duusare sthaan par hai, test main bhale idhar bich pichde hon lekin lagaataar ek saal se zyada vakt tak haal main hi pehle sthaan par bane hue the
 If you get a chance to play more domestic cricket, then it will improve, as happens with all teams
 aaj bhi vahi 'sada-galaa’ bisisiai is khel ko chalaa rahaa he jisane bharat ko vishwa cricket kii satta or aarthiki ke centre main laa khadaa kiya he
 The 'rot' that the Supreme Court is trying to remove is not even about match-fixing but is related to betting and conflict of interest
 aisa isliye kyonki bharat main sattebaaji pratibandhit he, lekin utani hi prachlan main he jitani gujarat main sharaab
 This can be solved easily
 iske liye bas sattebaaji ko kanoonee bananaa hoga or is par tex lagaana hoga
 This will enable transparent systems to be created so that conflicts of interests can be caught more easily
 sawaal he ki is pratibandh-premi desh main aisa karegaa koun?ek asambhav bachaav: bharat-australia cricket siries shuru hone vaali he
 So, this is the right time to question another deviation in our public discourse
 cricket se hamaari saarvajanik shabdaawalee main aayaa lokapriy muhaavara he 'baikfoot par aa janaa
 'cricket lovers should be cautious, especially because it can happen in winter, we have to wake up at dawn as we did last Tuesday when we saw David Warner spin and pace bowling straight across the boundary
 vah bhi baikfoot par rahete hue!main nahin kah saktaa ki hamane baikfoot ko badnaam karnaa kab se shuru kiya
 Rajdeep Sardesai, who has a strong cricket legacy among us, believes that it must have happened because Indian batsmen traditionally played on the front foot
 isaki kahin zyada khurafati vyakhya yah ho sakati he ki ham hameshaa se hi choti or oochaal maarane vaali bounsar gendon se khauf khate rahe hai jo hamen baikfoot par 'dhakel’ detii thim
 Some of the most aggressive shots have been played on the backfoot, especially dangerous shots such as cut, pull, square cut and hook
 yaa phir sabase karine se khele jane vaale ve leg glans jinhen ranjai ne ijad kiya, let cat, yaa phir kuulhe ko halkaa-sa mataka kar fine leg se single chura lene kii kala jise ravi shastri kaa mashhoor chapatti shot kaha jaataa tha
 When the same shot came out of VVS Laxman's wrist, it was stamped with fours
 ek baar maine sachin se poocha tha ki ve un shot kii suchi bataaen jinhen ve apane saathi khiladinnon se churaana chahenge, tab unhone vivies lakshmana ke 'kuulhe matakaane vaale’ shot kaa zikr kiya tha
 Nowadays you can see Virat Kohli applying this shot in covers on the back foot
 is stambh kaa vishay pratibandh kii sanak he, to mat bhoolen phil hugs ko jo baikfoot par hook karte ek bounsar se jaan ganvaa baithe or bounsar par pratibandh lagane kii maang jari he
 Whatever be the case, modern style T20 marka cricket has reinvented batting techniques
 ab to bas gend ko dekhie or shot jad dijie
 In this new adventurous world of cricket where players like Sehwag, Warner and de Villiers can hit the cut on the front foot and bounce the ball in the air at points instead of playing the ground shots, you have to correct your vocabulary
 kuch nahin to back foot ke badakismat muhaavarey ko to ab dafna hi dijie
 MP Pappu Yadav is known for consistently making controversial statements to stay in the headlines
 mangalvaar ko bhi darbhanga pahunche pappu yadav ne ek aisa bayaan diya jisase vivaad khadaa ho gaya
 Pappu Yadav said that it would be better if the Naxalites do not kill the soldiers but the politicians
 darasal patna ke beur jail main 3 hafte band rahane ke baad pappu yadav baahar aa chuke hai or baahar aane ke baad mangalvaar ko sukama ke naksali hamale main shahid jawan naresh yadav ke parivaar waalon se milane darbhanga pahunche
 Pappu Yadav, when he met the family of martyr Naresh Yadav, consoled him and also provided financial help of Rs 50,000
 pappu ne shahid kii beti ke shaadi kaa kharch bhi uthaane kii ghoshnaa kii
 Talking to reporters after meeting the family, Pappu Yadav said that the Naxalites should eliminate not the soldiers but the politicians of the country
 pappu ne kaha ki naksali ko un rajanetaaon kii hatya karne chahie jo desh ke system ko chalaa rahe hai
 Pappu believed that Naxalites should wage war not against the security forces but against the leaders
 pappu ne kaha ki desh kirajnneetiki policy bahut kharaab he or garib or zyada garib hota ja rahaa he or jaruratmand logon ko nyaay nahin mil rahaa he balki uskaa shoshan ho rahaa he
 This is not the first time that Pappu Yadav's words about the country's leaders have deteriorated
 isse pehle bhi kai baar desh ke bhrasht netaaon par pappu yadav ne kadi tippanee kii he or unhen dekhte hi goli maar dene kii vakaalat kii he

 mahakaal kii nagari ujjain 12 saal main ek baar lagane vaale sinhasth mahakumbh kii mejabani ke liye taiyaar ho rahi he
 But a lot of work and projects related to this mega event, which will start in April, are going on at a very slow pace
 bharpoor bajet hone ke baavjood sinhasth se jude kaary kaaphi peeche hai or taiyaariyon ko dekhakar lag rahaa he ki kai kaam mela shuru hone ke baad bhi puure nahin ho paaenge
 Former Chief Minister and Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh has alleged that investigations into the scams in Simhastha-2004 have not been completed and now they have a chance to commit corruption again
 unhone kaha, ''kaam karne vaale sabhi thekedaar bijepi ke hai or adhikari kamishankhori kar rahe hai

 There is only three months left for the fair to start
 yahi vajah he ki unhone sinhasth se jude kaamon kii samiksha ke liye har hafte ek mantri ko ujjain jane ke liye kaha he
 Unfinished Schemes Sadhus and saints have always expressed their displeasure over the dirt coming into the Kshipra through the Khan River
 isi samasya ko dur karne ke liye rajya sarkaar ne khan nadi diavarjan yojana taiyaar kii thi, jiskaa mukhya uddeshy kshipraa nadi ke jal ko saaf rakhana tha

 iske liye farvari 2016 ke ant kii dedline tay kii gai he
 But 19 km long and Rs 90 crore

 The plan is unlikely to be completed before the event begins

 The last date for completion was December 15
 nirmaan kii sust raftaar ke maddenjar dedline ko 31 janvari tak badha diya gaya
 But the pace of work is still sluggish, so the construction will be completed in the new deadline, there is doubt

 For Simhastha, work is being done to widen the road from Ujjain to Dewas along with Agar

 Its purpose is that the crowd can be seen inside the temple in a short time
 adhikari ise april tak puraa kar lene kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 Apart from the unfinished works of Simhastha, the displeasure of saints and saints is also a big concern for the Shivraj government
 yahaan ashramon ke liye aavantit kii jane vaali bhoomi ko lekar santon main naaraazgi he or ve prashasan se is babat shikaayatein bhi darj kara rahe hai
 Says Madanmohan Das of the Nirmohi Ani Akhara, "the administration is discriminating in land allocation
" aavanton kii prakriya samaj se pare he
 "the sages and saints allege that there is discrimination in the allocation of land such as good and land near Kshipra is being given to the favorites
" sadhu-sant kshipraa nadi main gandagi par bhi khaase naaraaz hai
 He claims that the government has not yet done any concrete work to curb pollution and clean up the dirt in Kshipra
 dharmik aayojan main raajnneeti kiye jane kii shikaayat sadhu-santon ke alaava aam log bhi kar rahe hai
 Nand Kishore and his brother Ambaram, the owners of 10 bighas of land on the banks of the Kshipra river, had to give their 3 bighas of land to build a bridge for Simhastha
 narsingh ghat kaa yah pul lakhon logon ke avaagaman kii raah to aasaan karegaa
 But Nand Kishore claims that by not making this bridge straight, the leaders and officials have made its design desirable
 nand kishor kehete hai, ''is raste main mantri paras jain or vidhayak mohan yadav kii jameen aa rahi he
 Therefore its design has been changed
 '' jabaki ambaram kehete hai, ''is tarah kisaan prashasan kii manamaani kaa shikaar hue he
 “it is also a big challenge for the government to organize this event in a safe and peaceful manner

 What is the process of hanging, what are the rights of the convicts to be hanged, what happens after these rights are over, what is the preparation of the prison administration before hanging, such questions are important people to know about Want to iske alaava jail main kis tareeke se doshiyon ko faansee di jaaegi, jail menual main kya likhaa he, faansee ghar kaisaa hota he, jaise sawaal bhi dilo-dimag par ghoomte hai
 The guilty gets many rights: There are questions in everyone's mind that despite so many heinous crimes, why is it taking so long (7 years) to hang? On this, former Tihar DG Ajay Kashyap says that death penalty is a punishment after which there is no scope of return
 aise main doshi ko uskaa ek-ek adhikaar istemaal karne diya jaataa he
 However, to drag it longer, the convict and his lawyer do several tricks
 aisa hi is cese main bhi hua
 After the High Court upheld the execution of the sentence, the matter of filing a review petition in the Supreme Court or challenging the decision, the convicts do not put the petition together
 balki ek-ek kar yachika daalate hai jisamen kaaphi samay lagata he
 After the jail term over the waiting option for the black warrant, the Tihar administration gives the convicts time to write an apology petition before the President before hanging
 nirbhaya cese main bhi tihaad ne sabhi doshi vinay, akshay, mukesh, pawan sabhi ko kshamaa yachika lagane ke liye 7 din kaa samay diya
 However, only Vinay Sharma imposed this petition, which was recommended by the Delhi government to be rejected by LG Anil Baijal, LG, Ministry of Home Affairs and now Home Ministry has sent it to the President
 ab raashtrapati apana faisla tihaad ko bhejenge
 If the President rejects this petition, the Tihar administration will go to court and issue a death warrant (also called a black warrant) against the convict
 iske baad court faansee kii taarikh or samay tay karegaa
 From the day of issue of the black warrant, there is 15 days from the day of execution
 ye 15 din kaidi kii kai tarah kii jaanch ke liye, faansee ke intjaam ke liye istemaal kiye jate hai
 In this, the family members are introduced to the prisoner for the last time
 court chaahe to vinay sharma kikshama yachikakhrij hone ke baad sabhi doshiyon kaa blike warrant jari kar saktaa he
 Because given the time, Mukesh, Pawan, Akshay did not petition, but the court can give them a chance
 baxur se aegi faansee kii rassijallaad ke bare main puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab mentihadgel ke purv diji ajay kashyap ne kaha, jahaan tak jallaad ke hone na hone kii baat he, to usase koi fark nahin padataa
 The hanging is given in the rare case
 ab se pehle aakhri faansee 2013 main afjal guru ko di gai thi
 Therefore, there is no need for executioner
 deth warrant jari hone ke baad faansee kii rassi baxur se mangai jaaegi
 There is only one hanging house in Tihar Jail No

 iske bare main tihaad ke purv piaaro sunil gupta ne kaha ki jail main doshiyon ko ek-ek kar faansee di ja sakati he
 Or they can also be hung together
 jail main itani jagah hoti he ki doshiyon ko ek saath bhi lataka diya jaae
 Morning hanging is given at 6 am in summer and 7 am in winter
 faansee vaale din subah doshi ko chaay di jaati he
 If they want to have breakfast, it is given

 Earlier, due to uproar, the meeting had been postponed four times for a while
 daanv par sadan kii pratishthasadan kii baithak shuru hone par sabhapati naidu ne aavashyak dastavej sadan ke patal par rakhwae
 He then appealed to all members to contribute positively in the smooth running of the house citing the dignity and reputation of the House due to the uproar

 He said that Parliament's reputation is at stake due to the absence of proceedings in the House
 iske baad shunya kaal main hi vibhinn dalon ke sadasyon ne narebaaji shuru kar di
 AIADMK members came close to the asanas opposing the construction of the dam on the Kaveri River

 But he could not be heard due to the noise

 Azad also stood up to speak, but he could not start his speech due to the uproar
 iske baad naidu ne niyam 255 or 256 kaa sandarbh dete hue donon dalon ke 12 sadasyon kaa naam pukaara
 Under Rule 255 of the House, the Chairman, on the conduct of any member, directs him to go out of the House and not participate in the proceedings of the House on that day

 Even after this, these 12 members kept shouting slogans in front of the seat
 iske chalate baithak thodi-thodi der ke liye do baar sthagit kerani padi
 After the adjournment of four times, when the meeting started at three o'clock, the same view was seen in the House

 bhartiya arthvyavastha ko susti se ubaarane ke liye mukhya saadhan baari nivesh hi he, lekin centre sarkaar khud rajasav ghatane kii vajah se pareshaan he
 On the other hand, despite the government continuously infusing capital into public banks, their non-performing assets (npas) continue to grow and their debt is not growing enough

 Continuing capital infusion in banks, Nirmala Sitharaman has announced a capital infusion of Rs 70,000 crore in public banks, followed by public capital of around 3
 19 lakh karod rupee tak pahunch chuki he

 46 lakh karod rupee kii puunji di gai he or unhone khud bhi 0
 66 lakh crore has been raised
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki bainkon ko puunji is vajah se diya ja rahaa he taaki ve ‘samay se apane enpie ke masale kaa samaadhaan’ kar saken
 npas are non-performing assets such as stranded debts that ultimately have to be written off

 Declining Debt: Public sector banks' loans to non-food sectors such as non-industry, services, personal loans and agriculture have shown a steady decline since FY 2010-11
 haalanki, vitt varsh 2018-19 main isamen kuch sudhaar hua he
 Since FY 2014-15, there has been an increase in debt in the field of personal loans and services, not in industry, agriculture or related matters

 During this period, the debt growth of other scheduled commercial banks (private and foreign banks) was very high and it increased from 10% in March 2018 to 13 in March 2019

 There was a time when Bollywood's most entertaining actor Govinda gave the biggest hits with David Dhawan
 lekin is jodi kii aakhri film partner 2007 main ai thi
 The film also had Salman Khan, who is now giving more preference to action role films
 lekin film main tera hero main aap salmaan, govinda or david dhawan kii tikdi ko katai miss nahin karenge
 Varun Dhawan has not only made his own comedy potential known by acting well in the film, but has also made the path of the return of 90s comedy King David Dhawan easy
 romens, ection or kamedi se phuli loded he film main tera hero
 Whether it is about dialogue delivery or expression, Varun Dhawan has followed the strong points of both Govinda and Salman
 phir bhi varun se shikaayat nahin, kyonki unhone nakal main bhi akl lagaai he or niraash nahin kiya he
 What is the story of the film There is only one rule to watch David Dhawan's films
 apana dimag or logic ghar par chhod aaiye
 The same situation is also in the film Main Tera Hero
 haalanki screenple ne har cituation ko bakhubi jastiphai kiya he
 Sheenu (varun Dhawan), who lives in a camel, is haunted by the ghost of becoming a film hero, which haunts the entire city
 khud ko pruv karne wo pahunchataa he bengalooru ke ek college main
 He falls in love with Sunaina (ileana d'cruz) in college
 yaheen par aata he film kaa pehla conflict
 Actually, the police officer Angad (arunoday Singh) also wants Sunaina and he does not like that Sunaina talks to anyone in college
 lekin ye film lav triangal nahin he
 There is another angle in it, that of Ayesha (nargis Fakhri)
 film main doosraa conflict point tab aata he jab sunaina ko agava kar bangkok le jaaya jaataa he
 Sunaina's kidnapping is done for Aisha
 plon ke mutabik agar shinu ko aaysha ke paas bangkok bulaanaa he to usee kii garlfriend ko kidanap karaao jise bachaane shinu jarur aayega
 There is no need to stress the mind for what the story will be next
 kyonki is baat kii puri gunjaaish he ki aapaki soch film ke climex se kahin zyada innovative hogi
 Yet this film is a little different from David Dhawan's Mindless Comedy
 salmaan or govinda ko aisi kai filmon ke baad darshakon ne comic kirdaaron main apanaaya
 Obviously, Varun too has a long way to go
 agar is film kaa uddeshy varun dhawan ko bataur comic actor sthapit karnaa tha to jaahir he film mekars bahut had tak aisa karne main kaamyaab rahe
 Although Nargis Fakhri took over the role, Ileana d'cruz proved unfit for the film
 sajid-waajid ke sangeet ne film ke pes ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 i would not suggest you waste money on multiplex tickets for this film
 phir bhi agar aap dhawan kii kamedi miss kar rahe hai to is van time movie ko dividi par dekhnaa best opshan hoga

 The Bharatiya Janata Party wants the martyrdom of the entire soldiers doing politics on their courage and valor to garner votes in their name '

 He said that 'when Indira Gandhi liberated Bangladesh, Atal Bihari Bajpai had said in Parliament that Indira Gandhi is Durga
 jab uskaa shrey indira gandhi ko mila he to sajirkal strike yaa air strike kaa shrey kise milanaa chahie? In Delhi, a freak lover fell in love with a married woman

 Bharatiya Janata Party MP and former Union Minister Anant Kumar Hegde claims that in Maharashtra, the BJP did a drama by making Fadnavis the Chief Minister to save a fund of 40 thousand crores
 haalanki, purv mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne daawey ko nakaar diya he
 Read: Devendra Fadnavis said on Anant Hegde's claim - no money was returned Anant Kumar Hegde said, 'you all know that our man (fadnavis) in Maharashtra became Chief Minister for 80 hours and then resigned

 If Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena had come to power, they would have misused 40 thousand crores
 yahi kaaran he ki centre sarkaar ke is paise ko vikaas ke liye istemaal main nahin laayaa ja sake, iske liye drama kiya gaya
 He said, 'this was the bjp's plan from long ago
 isliye yah tay kiya gaya ki ek naatak hona chahie or isi ke tahat fadanvis ne siem pad kii shapath lee
 Within 15 hours of taking the oath, Fadnavis sent all 40 thousand crores to the place from where he had come

 ' sau saal main ek baar aane vaale tarikhon ke mahasanyog 11-11-11 ko logon ne dar or aashcharya ke bich rahete hue manaaya jabaki visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki yah aankada samvaad or nai shuruuaat kii ore le jaataa he
 The date of Friday is similar when read from front and back and is a very interesting coincidence for mathematicians
 ganitagyon kaa kahana he ki 2011 ek aisi dhanatmak sankhya he jo keval khud se yaa ek se vibhajit hoti he
 Mathematics professor r Shukla said that if we look carefully, this (2011) is a number in which the sum of any three consecutive numbers is itself an undivided number divided only by itself and one

 har congressi kii najar main ve unke liye brahmastra hai
 Priyanka Gandhi, the mother of two school-going children - 13-year-old Rehan and 11-year-old Miraya - are the most attractive members of the Vadra Gandhi family
 ve yuva hai, karishmai hai or raajnneeti main daksh hai
 This week, she is celebrating her 42nd birthday
 vaise, ye sari khubiyaan rahul gandhi main honi chahie thim
 Priyanka herself says that Brahmastra can be "used only once"
 ’’ lekin kaaryakartaaon kii tarah zyaadaatar congress netaaon kaa maananaa he ki brahmastra istemaal karne kii abhi sabase zyada jarurat he
 The crisis of existence has arisen in front of the stricken Congress due to corruption, inefficiency and defeat in successive elections
 congress ke ek puraane netaa kaa kahana he, ‘‘yah koi saamaanya chunaav nahin he
 This is a fight for our existence, we cannot adopt a survival attitude to fight in future
 agar ham haar gaye, jaisaa anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he, to agali jang ke liye taiyaar hone kaa samay shaayad kabhi nahin aayega
 Last week, Priyanka's presence at a meeting of senior Congress office bearers like Ahmed Patel, Janardan Dwivedi and Madhusudan Mistry in Delhi triggered political speculation as to whether she would enter politics
 unhen gandhi parivaar kaa sabase aakarshak vyakti mana jaataa he lekin ve ab tak bade salike se kisi bhi tarah kii aupchaarik rajnatik bhoomika se parhez karti rahi hai
 However there is no doubt that Priyanka is going to help her brother immensely as he prepares for the 2014 election
 ve raajnneeti main na hote hue bhi sakriy hai or apane kaamkaaj kaa dayera badha rahi hai
 In such a situation, the opposition will be eyeing them along with the Congress
 party ke liye kyon mahatvapurn hai priyankounke liye yah bhoomika koi nai nahin he
 She has always been behind the scenes in Congress and campaigned for her brother and mother only by staying away from active politics
 ve har mahatvapurn maukey par unke saath najar ai hai, chaahe vah 2004 main sonia gandhi ke pradhanmantri pad ko thukaraane kaa maamla ho yaa janvari 2013 main jaipur ke congress adhiveshan main rahul gandhi kaa sweekaarokti bhaashan ho
 a person close to the family recalls that on March 8, 1988, at the Congress session at Siri Fort, she was holding her hand while taking her mother in the car
 gandhi parivaar kii teen peedhishon se jude ek varisht congressi kaa kahana he, ‘‘ve bahut majboot shakhsiyat vaali mahila hai or jab bhi parivaar par koi sankat hota he ve bahut kargar hoti hai
 In the last two years, the Congress lost 12 out of 16 assembly elections
 agar chunaav visheshgyon kii maani jaae to is saal hone vaale aam chunaav main party haar kii ore badhati najar aa rahi he
 It is no surprise then that the despondent Congress workers are expecting Priyanka to overcome her destiny
 unhone akele dam par 1999 main bellari chunaav ko apni maa ke paksh main mode diya or sushamaa swaraj ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 When his father's relative Arun Nehru became BJP candidate from Rae Bareli in 1999, it was Priyanka who attacked him and called him non-loyal
 lekin unhone apane pita ke us rishtedaar ko bhulaayaa nahin
 When she died in July last year, Priyanka's son Rehan set her pyre on fire
 jahaan tak congress kaaryakartaaon kaa sawaal he to unka maananaa he ki ve unhen badhat dilaa sakati hai or rashtriya manch par unka jaadu chal saktaa he
 But despite campaigning for the Congress in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, she could win the party in only three of the 12 assembly seats in Amethi and Rae Bareli
 rajnatik vishleshak swapn dasgupta kaa kahana he, ‘‘bhale hi ve samarpit congress kaaryakartaaon main josh bhar den lekin desh main congress virdohi jabardast bhaavana ke maddenjar yah vakt kharaab he
 "the party is in a bad state, activists are disillusioned, it is no surprise that Rahul Gandhi is relying on his sister for political wisdom and ideas
" indira gandhi ke jamaane se hi party se jude ek netaa kaa kahana he, ‘‘kuch logon main netritv kii khubiyaan janmajaat hoti hai, ve unheen logon main shumaar hai
 "I was also among the first to reach 10 Janpath when Rajiv was killed," says a close aide of the Gandhi family with an anonymity
 soniyaji kaaphi pareshaan thim, haalanki priyanka bahut choti thim lekin ve kaaphi dhiraj rakhe hui thim
 She was monitoring the arrangements for 10 Janpath as well as bringing Rajiv's body from Sriperumbudur
 unhone parthiv sharir ko laane kii prakriya tej karne ke liye raashtrapati or pradhanmantri ko phone kiya
 Priyanka has always been in the role of a protector for the Priyankagandhi family
 unki bhoomika aisi he jisamen ve khud lim lite main nahin aatin balki ve khud ko jaan-boojhkar peeche kar leti hai
 She is the charioteer, not the chariot warrior of the Gandhi family, who is active in every role, from strategizing the war to adviser and taking up arms directly when needed
 jab bhi parivaar sankat main hota he, priyanka ko aap saamne rahakar jujhate dekh sakate hai
 In 1999, when Sonia Gandhi was contesting the Lok Sabha elections in Amethi and Bellary in Karnataka and Sushma looted all election campaigns in Kannada, the Congress remembered Priyanka and then Priyanka gave Bellary a day of stormy road The way it won the show became an unforgettable moment in the political history of the Congress
 priyanka gandhi apane sthir chitt or avivaadit vyaktitv ke kaaran bhi congress kii puunji hai
 She is not allowed to be in discussions like husband Robert Vadra
 pati se jude kisi bhi aarthik len-dein main unka naam nahin judata he
 Till date, there has been no such statement that it seems that as a member of the country's most important political family, she wants a position
 balki baar-baar unhone yahi kaha he ki ve raajnneeti main nahin aaengi or unka uddeshy sirf logon or party kii seva karnaa he
 During his campaign in Amethi and Rae Bareli, he can be seen to be very comfortable with the poor-dalits and minorities
 indira gandhi kaa aksarayabareli ke shivgarh block ke dhaukalganj gaanv main rahane vaali 45 varshiya kalavati se miliye to vah saare kaam chhodkar priyanka gandhi ke kisse sunaane baith jaati hai
 Kalavati was not surprised when Priyanka Gandhi suddenly reached her farm on the afternoon of November 18 while harvesting paddy in the field
 kalavati ne priyanka ko apni hansiya dekar unhen dhan kaatane kaa tarika sikhaaya tha
 After spending about half an hour in the field with Priyanka Kalavati and some women from the village, she returned and was stopped by a rural Ramahal Maurya before boarding the car
 kaha, ‘‘bitiyaa ek geet sune jaavy
 At this, Priyanka got down from the car and heard his song
 ramtahal ne geet sunaaya, ‘‘aai lahar sonia ji ke sabakai duariya, najariya sabake panja par raho, rajeev, indira swarg main baitho khoi sari duniya
 Priyanka got emotional after listening to the song and went ahead thanking the villager
 priyanka gandhi jis tarah suraksha ke saare tamzam ko kinare rakhkar apni maa ke sansadeey kshetra main logon se milin, usne un sabhi baton kaa jawaab de diya ki aakhir kyon log priyanka main unki daadi indira gandhi kaa aks dekh rahe hai
 In October, the Allahabad city Congress created a ruckus in the politics by passing a resolution demanding the nomination of Priyanka Gandhi from Phulpur parliamentary constituency of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in the Lok Sabha elections
 iske baad shahar congress ke sachiv haseeb ahamed or youth congress ke sadsy shrishchandra dube ne civil lines main ek hording lagaakar sonia gandhi ko biimaar bataate hue priyanka gandhi ko pratyaashee banane kii maang kar ek nayaa vivaad khadaa kar diya
 The Congress immediately suspended these two leaders and tried to handle the matter
 bhai-bahan kii shakhsiyat main farkapriyanka or rahul kii shakhsiyat main kaaphi antar he
 Rahul is hardworking, passionate, dull, and stubborn
 saath hi bhaashan dene main sahajata mahasoos nahin karte
 On the other hand, Priyanka has tremendous attraction, she speaks fluent Hindi and gets along with people very easily
 ve hazirajavaab bhi hai or apni pratikriya se akasar virodhiyon ko pani-pani kar detii hai
 Priyanka was greatly hurt by the bjp's campaign of Sonia being a foreigner
 videshi mahila kii beti qaraar die jane par unhone yah kahkar apane virodhiyon ko chakit kar diya tha, ‘‘aapako lagata he meri ragon main koi videshi khun daud rahaa he
 "similarly, when Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi called the Congress" old ", he retorted that" i look old to you
 " ’’ congressi unamem jawaharlal nehru kii hazirajvaabi or indira gandhi kii dridhtaa ek saath dekhte hai
 Ironically, at a time when the Congress is preparing to make Rahul the prime ministerial candidate, many in the party are considering Priyanka Gandhi as the liberator
 kai puraane congressi, yahaan tak ki party or parivaar se darkinar kar die gaye natwar singh jaise log unki tarif kar rahe hai
 Natwar Singh has worked with four generations of the Gandhi family and has seen both Rahul and Priyanka grow up
 unka kahana he, ‘‘unamem (priyanka main) rajnatik pravriti he
 He has the political wisdom of his grandmother and the compassion and goodness of his father
 ’’maa, beti, bahan or patni ke rup main priyanka apane parivaar or saarvajanik jivan ke bich santulan bananaa jaanati hai
 They also know that she is the most popular member of the family but to keep the mother and brother in the spotlight, they themselves live in their shadows
 sooti sari yaa chudeedaar kurte main ve amethi-raibareli ke graminon ko purv pradhanmantri or apni daadi indira gandhi kii yaad dilaati hai
 Unlike her brother, she trusts her innate intelligence and makes quick decisions
 apni doston ke bich kisi tarah kaa dikhaava na karne vaali priyanka ko bachche pasand hai
 Like his father, he is also fond of photography and for this reason he wrote a book on photographs on the tiger
 gandhi parivaar ke ek kareebi vyakti kaa kahana he ki unheen kii pahal par nai dilli sthit rajeev gandhi foundation kii basament ko bacchon kii khubasurat librari main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 Children in schools can spend the whole day there reading books on various subjects
 ve anaath bacchon ke liye bhi samay nikaal leti hai
 Gives gifts to the Missionaries of Charity in Jangpura, New Delhi
 yah sanstha madar terresa dwaara sthapit kii gai thi or kusht rogiyon kii seva iskaa pramukh kaam he
 Priyanka has all the qualities of a modern urban woman
 ve iske alaava bacchon ke liye khaanaa banane se lekar unhen chhuttiyon main ghumaane ke liye le jane tak sabhi kaamon main dilchaspee leti hai
 So those who come to their residence at 35 Lodhi Estate also feed their baked dishes
 aadhyatmik taur par ve khud ko buddha dharm ke kareeb maanati hai
 Like her husband Robert Vadra, she does not go to gym regularly but does yoga to keep her healthy
 congress par najar rakhane vaale logon kaa maananaa he ki siyaasi maamalon main ve apni maa or bhai ke mukaable zyada fori faisle karti hai
 She mixes easily with the activists of her mother's and brother's electorate
 agar koi unhen acha vichaar sujhaaye to ve fouran use lapak leti hai or use amali jama pahanaati hai
 Not only this, unlike her brother, she does not shy away from the media
 unhen bhaleebhanti maaloom he ki media kis pahalu par focus karegaa
 She deliberately gives photographers such moments and poses, which are covered in the next day's newspapers
 ve jab bhi bolti hai, media ko surkhiyaan mil jaati hai
 Rahul's hopes of crossing the road are not being speculated for Kamprianka's entry into active politics
 party ke kareebi logon kaa maananaa he ki pichley do maah main mahatvapurn faislon main unki dakhlandaji bad gai he
 Indeed, the Congress vice-president has so far failed electoral politics
 pichley do saal main desh ke 16 rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hue hai
 Barring the happy coincidence of Karnataka, the election of every major state went on to tease Rahul
 karnataka kii jeet congress kii jeet he yaa bijepi or bi
 s
 yeddiurppa kii aapasi ladaai kii haar, yah vivaad kaa vishay he
 Of the 1,974 seats in these 16 states, the Congress had just 583 assembly seats, while bjp's assembly seats rose to 701
 anya dalon kii sanyukt takat bhi 690 ke aankade ke saath congress se kahin baari he
 So does the country, which had been seizing Rajiv Gandhi in 1984 by giving more than 400 Lok Sabha seats, want to make his sahibzade the head of the third party? Another big danger is hovering over the party as Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) 
 lutiuns kii dilli ke alag-alag bangalon se rahul gandhi baari-bharkam ranneetiyaan banaate rahe or vahiin uski sabase safal mukhyamantri shila dikshit ko 25,000 se zyada voton se haraakar arvind kejariwal dilli ke mukhyamantri ban gaye
 If AAP cleaned someone in Delhi, it was the Congress
 congress or aap donon hi inclusive growth kii baat karti hai or donon hi aam aadmi kii pairokaar hai
 The idea of both is secular
 donon kaa janm madhyavargeey andolan se hua he
 This is the first time in the history of Congress that it has to fight its clone in a way
 ek aisa clon jo usase kahin zyada jununee he or un vichaaron ke zyada kareeb he jin par ab tak congress kaa copirite tha
 In any case, the help of brothers, Congressmen feel that Priyanka has the power to recover that copyright
 unhone amethi-raibareli main aisa kar dikhaaya he
 The result of the 2012 assembly election was like a four-pronged attack for the Congress in UP
 congress ko mahaj 28 siton se hi santosh karnaa padaa lekin sabase buree khabar raibareli or amethi se ai
 Congress could not open its account in five assembly seats of Rae Bareli parliamentary constituency and the party which won two out of five assembly seats in the same region, Amethi, which had won Rahul Gandhi by a record four lakh votes in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 He breathed
 chunaavon main kharaab pradarshan kii vajahen talashne ke liye jab july 2011 main rahul gandhi ne dilli main amethi or raibareli ke congress kaaryakartaaon kii baithak bulaai to usamen maujuud priyanka gandhi ko party kii asal ‘‘beemaari’’ samajhane main der na lagi
 Now on his initiative, a new organization is ready at the Gram Panchayat level in Raeberli and Amethi
 donon sansadeey kshetron main shahar, jila se lekar ward or gaanv str tak congress cameti kaa gathan karne se pehle aam janata ke bich se isamen shaamil hone kii ichha rakhane waalon se biodata mangaya gaya
 After this, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi have themselves elected the presidents of all the committees by taking interviews
 cametiyon main 90 pratishat nae chehron ko jagah di gai he
 Priyanka has started the congress-your-door scheme in Rae Bareli and Amethi due to these activists
 amethi jila congress adhyaksh yogendra mishra bataate hai ki ‘‘15 janvari tak amethi kii sabhi 768 gram panchayaton main nayaa sanghathan khadaa ho jayega
 In the Lok Sabha elections, Rahul will win with more votes
 ’’congressi netaaon ko lagata he ki raibareli kii tarah hi priyanka puure desh main congress ko nayaa rasta suza sakati hai
 Experts say that she had taken the most initiative to bring Raa to politics and she would do everything possible to make him successful
 seedblusi ke ek sadsy kaa kahana he, ‘‘ve apane bhai kii madad or unke prayaason ko badhaava dengi
 People get ripped off by the charm of politics and power, but they will never do anything that their brother can ignore
 ’’2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress rahul ko rath par savaar karegi or sarathi hongi priyanka
 (with Piyush Babelle, Jatin Gandhi and Ashish Mishra) janaganana ke aankadon ko ‘soochnaaon kaa khajaana ’ qaraar dete hue pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha ki isse sarkaar ko vikaas kaaryon kii yojana banane main madad milegi
 Singh, who recorded information about himself in census registration, asked every citizen to participate in this national campaign so that everyone can be included in this process
 unhone kaha, ‘is panjikaran ke kaaran vikaas kaary ke liye yojana banane main soochnaaon kaa bhandar taiyaar hoga
 Singh said that the census in India is the world's largest campaign to collect statistical data
 unhone kaha, ‘kuch aankade to hamaari aarthik or saamaajik gatividhiyon ke liye yojana banane main mahatvapurn yogadan karte hai or isse yojana tathaa vikaas kii prakriya main mahatvapurn soochna praapt hoti he

 com / ibyszippdo — Tiger Shroff (@itigershroff) July 7, 2016 bajet satr shuru hone se pehle congress ke netaa sandip dikshit ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki ham nahin maanate ki bijepi aatanki camp chalaati he
 However, Sandeep Dixit definitely said that some of his people who were earlier in the party have been found involved in terrorist activities
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ko is maamle ko raajnneetik rang nahin dena chahie
 It is worth mentioning that Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde had said in a disputed statement about saffron terrorism that the BJP and RSS have been involved in terrorist activities
 haalanki vivaad or virodh badhane par scindia ne kaha ki unke bayaan ko thik tareeke se nahin liya gaya tha
 The BJP has said on Wednesday that it will not allow Parliament to run until Shinde apologizes for his statement
 kuch log kai saal vajan ghataane kii koshish karte hai, phir bhi unhen kamyaabi hasil nahin hoti

 So this is the real reason for weight gain

 Exercising the same type of exercise is necessary to reduce obesity, but doing one kind of exercise does not affect obesity

 If you want to lose weight, first stop eating such things

 Eat fresh fruits instead
 vajan kam karnaa hai to pasta khaaen
 
 
 Eat less sweet
 If you like sweet, then control it
 kyonki meetha motopa badhaata he
 Do not eat anything sweet, especially after dinner

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has alleged that UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi represents the Congress's emergency mindset, disunity and undemocratic trend and under this she has democratically set up a parallel power center called the National Advisory Council
 usne aarope lagaaya ki isi maansikta ke chalate vah desh kii janata se apane dharm, beemaari or iskar sambandhi jaankaree bhi chhipaati aa rahi hai
 These allegations have been leveled against Sonia in the latest issues of the mouthpiece 'panchjanya' and 'organizer' to be published in Hindi and English of the Sangh
 panchajnya ke sampadakeey main kaha gaya he ki rashtriya salaahkaar parishad naamak samanaantar satta kendra ke jariye ‘sonia sampradayik evam lakshith hinsa rokthaam vidheyak jaise kaale kanoon kaa praaroop taiyaar karake vidhaayi prakriya main asanvaidhanik hastkshep karne jaisi himakat kar rahi hai
 'it has been questioned that whether the country is the property of the Congress, which will be run according to its political interests, power and intentions? Meanwhile, in the article of Organizer, the Congress President has been accused that Sonia is very secretive about her public life
 isamen kaha gaya he, ‘sonia gandhi ne pehle apane dharm ko chipaaya, phir sambandhiyon ko chipaaya or ab apni beemaari ko

 isamen kaha gaya he ki isse pehle unhone apane dharm kii jaankaree dene se yah kahkar inkaar kar diya tha ki yah unka nijee maamla he jise vah saarvajanik nahin karnaa chahengi
 It said that despite giving this information in all government papers and forms, Sonia kept avoiding it
 sangh ne daawa kiya he ki congress adhyaksh ne apni shaikshanik yogyata ko bhi ‘ati gopneey’ bana kar chipaaya hua he
 Recently, in the context of her illness and treatment abroad, the article said, "even when Sonia became unwell and allegedly went abroad for treatment at government expense, she was in the name of" respecting privacy "
 He refused to tell the country anything about it
 isamen kaha gaya he ki agar unke upachaar par sarkari dhan kharch hua he to desh kii janata ko yah jaanane kaa haq he ki isamen kitna saarvajanik dhan laga or kyon laga
 The public also has the right to know that for the treatment of any disease she went abroad, was there no facility for her treatment in the country? kendriya sanchaar mantri kapil sibbal ne kaha ki sibar suraksha kii chunautiyon se nipatate vakt vyakti kii niztaa or desh kii suraksha chintaa ke bich santulan jaruri he
