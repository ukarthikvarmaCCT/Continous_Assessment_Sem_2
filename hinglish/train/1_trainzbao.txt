 30 november se shuru, paanch charnon main sampann honge chunaavgathbandhan kii vajah se muqabla hoga dilachaspkhanij sansadhano se bharpoor pradesh jharkhand main vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai
 Elections will begin in five phases starting November 30
 maharashtra kii tarah yahaan bhi bijepi ke sahyogi dal uskaa saath chhodte dikh rahe hai
 These include the influential organization All Jharkhand Student Union (AJSU) which has now split from the BJP
 bijepi ne 2014 main81 siton vaali jharkhand vidhansabhaamein 37 siten jiti thim
 The BJP crossed the majority mark by including five seats won by AJSU
 lekin is baar ye donon dal alag-alag chunaav lard rahe hai, duusari ore vipakshi dalon jharkhand mukti morcha (jhamumo), congress or rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ne gathbandhan kiya he or ve ise ek maukey ke rup main dekh rahe hai
 These three parties also fought the previous elections separately
 is baar inke bich hue gathbandhan kii vajah se muqabla dilachasp ho gaya he
 In the 2014 assembly elections, there were 33 seats on which there was a win-loss difference of 10,000 or less
 is baar ekajute vipaksh in siton par bijepi ko pareshaani main daal saktaa he
 Out of these 33 seats, 19 seats are such that the win-loss difference was less than 5,000
 in 19 main se 10 siten bijepi or ajasu gathbandhan ne jiti thim, 8 bijepi ne or 2 ajasu ne
 Apart from this, JMM and Congress were won by 3–3 seats, one by Babulal Marandi's party Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) and two others
 jin siton par haar-jeet kaa antar 5,000 se 10,000 ke bich rahaa, unamem se 7 akele bijepi ne jiti thim
 JMM won three seats, Congress won 2 seats and JVM 2
 is tarah kade mukaable vaali 33 siton main se 17 siten bijepi-ajasu gathbandhan ne jiti thim jisamen akele bijepi ne 15 siten jiti thim
 bjp's path not easy: India Today's Data Intelligence Unit (DIU), after analyzing the results of 2014 assembly elections, found that if all parties retain their support base after changing the political scenario, then bjp's path in these hard-fought seats is easy Will not happen
 in 10,000 se kam margin vaali siton par jhamumo, congress or rajd ke vot share ko milaane par hamane paaya ki bijepi pichhali baar jiti hui 15 siton main se 8 par haar jaaegi or ajasu apni donon siten haar jaaegi
 Thus, if the alliance votes are retained, BJP will get only 7 seats out of these low margin seats whereas JMM, Congress and RJD alliance will gain 10 seats
 ghatshila, gumla, lohardaga or rajmahal jaisi kuch siten jinpar 2014 main bhaajapa jiti thi, is baar ekajute vipaksh ke saamne use kaaphi mashkkat kerani hogi
 Incidentally, JMM is strong here due to the good number of tribal population in most of these seats
 haalanki, is shrenee kii kuch ahm siten jaise giridih, dumka or simdega par bijepi vaapasi kii ummid kar sakati he
 Seats with higher margins
 Let us now see the seats where the win-loss difference was more than 10,000 in 2014
 16 siten aisi thim jin par jeet-haar kaa antar 10,000 se 20,000 ke bich tha
 Out of these 16, BJP got 5 seats, JMM 5, JVM 3, Congress 1 and 2 others
 iske alaava 16 siten jahaan par jeet-haar kaa antar 20,000 se 30,000 ke bich tha, bijepi or ajasu ne milakar 8 siten jiti thim
 6 BJP and 2 AJSU
 jhamumo ne inamen se 5, jhavimo ne 1 or 2 siten anya ne jiti thim
 There were 16 seats where the win-loss difference was more than 30,000
 inamen se bijepi-ajasu gathbandhan ne 12 siten jeetin
 11 by BJP and 1 by AJSU
 jhamumo ne 3 or jhavimo ne 1 seat jiti
 Incidentally, in 2014, Ajsu contested only 8 seats and won 5 of these seats
 raajnneetik vishleshak kaa kya he kahanaais 10,000 se zyada margin vaali kul 48 siton main se bijepi-ajasu gathbandhan ne kul 25 siten jeet lee thim
 Of these 22 seats were won by BJP alone
 is baar in siton par bhi ekajute vipakshi dalon kaa gathbandhan bijepi ke liye kadaa muqabla pesh karegaa
 Based on the vote share of 2014, some important seats where the BJP can defeat the united opposition with just less than 5 percent difference are Jamshedpur West and Khunti
 paaramparik rup se bijepi shahari or kasbaai ilaakon main majboot he
 Political analysts believe that this party's base will prove to be lifesaving for him

 While watching this film, i felt that Santoshi should change his style in comedy a bit because at times he seems to repeat himself
 lekin, badi baat yah he ki ye film aapako manoranjan dene kaa vaada karti he or detii he
 Shahid Kapoor's comic timing is not only very good but he easily gives punch in his lines

 ADG Headquarters Sunil Kumar has said that the Thanedars were given strict instructions to completely ban liquor in their respective areas
 uske baad bhi kai thana kshetron main sharaab ke nirmaan or taskari par roak nahin lag paa rahi thi
 After reviewing all the police stations in Bihar, the police headquarters has taken action to suspend

 Everyday, liquor consignments are being caught every day in all the districts of liquor
 matlab saaf he ki bihar main sharaab par pabandi nahin lagi he
 Manjhi said that when the head of the household can be jailed for holding liquor or bottle of liquor from the house, when the liquor is being caught in Bihar and alcohol is being produced, the head of the state should be jailed in this situation
 vipaksh ke hamale or police associesan kii dhamkee par jediu ke pravaktaa niraj kumaar ne kaha ki bihar ke dijipi kaa aadesh tha ki jis ilaake main sharaab banane par roak nahin lagegi us ilaake ke thanedaar par karrwai hogi

 Under the new Act, now these eleven Thanedars will not even have a posting in any police station for next ten years

 BSP supremo Mayawati is criticizing the government for making changes on behalf of the Supreme Court in view of the misuse of SC-ST Act today, but there is also a truth that while in power 11 years ago, on behalf of her government this Through law, an innocent was instructed not to cause unnecessary harassment
 supreme courtki ore se essi-asti act main kiye gaye kai badlaavon ko lekar dalit samudaay main baari rosh he or iske virodh mendlit sangathnone somvaar ko bharat band kaa aayojan kiya tha
 The event turned violent in many places and people expressed their anger by sabotage, arson, stone pelting
 virodh-pradarshan or pradarshnakariyon par karrwai ke kaaran kai logon kii jaan bhi chali gai
 The Supreme Court on Tuesday has refused to put any restriction on its earlier decision on a review petition filed by the central government
 court ne is maamle main sabhi partiyon se agle do dinon main vistrut jawaab dene ko kaha he
 Now the next hearing of this case will be 10 days later

 On the day of Bharat Bandh, former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati also targeted the government fiercely and said that in view of the current attitude of the Center, there is a danger of being enslaved once again in front of the scheduled castes and tribes
 Therefore, this anger is being seen in the Dalit society
 somvaar ko supreme court ke faisle ko lekar punarvichaar yachika daakhil kiye jane par deree ko lekar unhone kaha, 'ham sansad main nahin hue to kya hua, ham apni takat ke dam par sansad ke baahar rahete hue bhi modi sarkaar ko ghutane techne par majaboor karne main samarth hai
 He alleged that the government tried to make this law inoperative
 unhone maang rakhi ki essi-asti act kii puraani sthiti behaal kii jaae
 Mairaj was arrested on an FIR, Rokmayawati is strongly criticizing the government's attitude after the changes made by the court, but the fact is that in 2007 when she was in power in Uttar Pradesh, at that time during her tenure The Chief Secretary had instructed the state's Alapolis officials that this law should not be misused and no innocent should be punished
 2007 oktober main cabinet ke jariye ek faisla liya tha jisamen sanshodhan ke jariye act main joda gaya ki yah bhi dhyaan rakhaa jaae ki kisi nirdosh vyakti ko anaavashyak pareshaan na kiya jaae yadi vivechna main kisi maamle main doshi paaya jaae ki jhooth maamla banaaya gaya he to us dasha main bhartiya dand vidhaan kii dhara 182 ke antargat karrwai kii jaae
 In Uttar Pradesh, complaints have been received for filing fake cases under the SC-ST Act and the Dowry Harassment Act
 sabase badi baat yah he ki isi sanshodhan ke baad uttar pradesh main 2007 main hi exiaar ke baad tatkaal giraftaar par roak bhi lag gai thi
 Action was ensured on all the firs registered under the Act only after detailed deliberation, which sent the message that the government refrained from taking action on the firs registered under the Dalit Atrocities Act

 is samudaay ke sadasyon ko utpeedan kii disha main nyaay sunishchit kiya jaae
 Along with providing speedy justice in case of harassment of members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, care should also be taken not to unnecessarily harass an innocent person
 'supreme courtne beete 20 march ko maharashtra ke ek maamle ko lekar essi-asti act main nai guideline jari kii, jiske tahat anusuchit jati, anusuchit janajati adhinium-1989 ke durupyog par bandish lagane ke liye faisla sunaaya gaya

 Quickheel has said that according to the name, these apps did not do any work for which these apps were allowed on the Google Play Store
 google ne isi vajah se inhen play store se hataane ke faisla kiya he
 Most of these apps were those whose names are associated with credit card process, home loan adviser
 aam taur par yugers aaj kal play store par apni aasaani ke liye aise eps search karte hai, taaki kaam aasaan ho sake
 Some developers use this to create apps whose name is associated with banking, but it does not work
 haalanki in eps kii jaankaree dekhne main asli lagati he, lekin ise downlod karke open karne par isamen koi bhi aise fitures nahin milte jo aapke kaam ke honge
 Here only the ads will be seen which the company has done for its profit and money
 yahaan data chori bhi ek makasad ho saktaa he jisase inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 All these apps work in the same way
 ye aapako kuch task dekar paise kamaane kaa mauka dene kaa daawa karte hai
 For this, the ad is shown without even wanting you
 vigyaapan par clic karke aapse kuch or bhi eps downlod karne ko kahe jate hai or isse aapako points milte hai
 It is claimed to transfer money to Paytm accounts of frequent point makers, but this does not happen
 report ke mutabik yugers ko har ap main total 22 vigyaapan ke video dekhne hote hai
 You need to be careful to avoid such fraud
 koi bhi ap downlod karne se pehle uske developers ke bare main dekhen or sambhav ho to google par uske bare main search kar len yahaan se aapako khud bhi andaja ho jayega
 If you still have these apps in your smartphone, delete them with immediate effect

 chunaav se pehle parisemen ne emsidi ke bade naamon ke maathe par chintaa kii lakeeren khinch di he
 Leader of Opposition in North MCD, Mukesh Goyal is also among those whose ward has been affected due to delimitation
 zaraa jaanate hai parisemen ke baad kya he dhirpur ward kaa sameekaran
 On Sunday, while walking in our ward, we met Leader of Opposition and Congress councilor Mukesh Goyal at North MCD
 goyal pichley 10 saalon se dhirpur se parshad hai, lekin is baar parisemen ke chalate unki vidhansabha se ek ward jahangirpuri-1 khatm kar diya gaya he
 At the same time, adding the Majlis Park to Dhirpur ward, Dhirpur ward has become bigger
 parisemen main fanse diggajagoyal ke mutabik unhone chunaav ayog ko suzav diya tha ki dhirpur main majalis park ko shaamil nahin kiya jaae, lekin aisa hua nahin
 On the other hand, the village of Peepal Thala was not included in Sarai Peepal Thala ward
 ab goyal bol rahe hai ki chunaav ayog ne jo suzav unase maange the, us par vichaar nahin kiya or parisaman kar diya
 Goyal clearly said that he is not satisfied with the delimitation
 aapako bataa den ki adarsh nagar vidhansabha main chaar ward aate the, jisamen dhirpur, adarsh nagar, sarai pipal thala or jahangirpuri-1 shaamil the
 After delimitation, Jahangirpuri-1 ward was abolished and some booths of Adarsh nagar ward were added to Goel's ward Dhirpur
 goyal ke mutabik, unke ward main lagbhag 14 nae booth jod die gaye hai, jisase ab unke saamne chunauti hogi nae votaron ke bich paith banane kii
 Although Goyal has been a councilor in Majlis Park before 2007, but he has not been there for almost 10 years, in such a situation, if the residents of Majlis Park believe that Goyal will have a challenge to get new voters in his favor
 logon ke mutabik, tikat milane par vah is baat kaa puraa dhyaan rakhenge ki koun sa ummidavaar unke ward se hi he or jo unki samasyaon ko khatm karne ke liye gambhir hoga
 Overall, it is clear that the big leaders have remained ghanchakars for the purpose of delimitation, but it is yet to be decided which ward will be reserved or which will be normal, in such a situation, the leaders are asleep now

 He also had to leave this post in February 2002

 After losing the assembly elections in 2005, BJP returned to power in 2012 and Parrikar once again became the Chief Minister

 In 2014, he resigned in November 2014 to become the defense minister in the Modi government at the Center

 Asian Games: 11wein din bharat kaa dabl dhamal, tripal jump-heptathalan main gold Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while interacting with children on the occasion of Teachers' Day, shared those things of his childhood, which probably nobody knew till today
 bacchon ne piem modi se sawaal kiya tha ki kya vah bhi bachapan main sharaaraten kiya karte the
 On hearing the question, Modi smiled and said that the development of children stops without mischief
 piem ne kaha, sach bataaun to bachapan main main khub sharaaraten kiya karata tha
 PM Modi told how on the occasion of weddings he used to show tamarind to the clarinetists with his friends so that his mouth would get watery and he could not play the clarinet
 piem ne bataaya ki shehanai bajaane vaala unhen maarane ke liye daudta tha or vah bhaag jate the
 Not only this, Modi also told that he used to staple the dresses of women and men guests who came to the wedding
 piem kaa jawaab sunakar sabhi log hans pade
 However, the PM promised the children that he would never commit such mischief
 holi rangon kaa tyohaar he
 People love this festival because of the colors
 is maukey par logon kaa utsaah dekhte hi banataa he
 By removing all the grievances, people apply color and hug each other
 rangon ke jitne phaayde hai utane hi nuksaan bhi hai
 Nowadays, every little thing is adulterated
 tyoharon ke dauraan mithaiyon main or doodh se bani anya chizon main baari maatra main milawat kii jaati he
 In the same way, many such chemicals are also added to colors which can prove to be harmful for our body
 takat or poshan kaa khajaana he ye faedgar holi khilne ke baad ye paanch lakshan dikhen to saavdhaan ho jaaen-1- rangon se khilne ke baad agar aap apni ankhon main khujali yaa jalan mahasoos kar rahe hai to ho saktaa he aapaki ankhon main rang chalaa gaya ho
 Wash eyes thoroughly with cold water
 agar samasya phir bhi thik nahin hoti he to foran doctor se sampark karen
 2- It has been seen many times that after playing with colors, itching occurs in your body for a long time
 kabhi-kabhi ye kuch samay main apane aap hi thik ho jaati he par agar lagaataar aisa ho rahaa he to ye chintaa kaa vishay he
 3- Playing with colors in the sun for a long time can make you feel weak and can feel dizzy
 shaadi ke bare main ye baaten chhupate hai aapke mata-pita4- holi main masti ke dauraan kai baar tabiyat itani bighad jaati he ki achaanak se ulti aani shuru ho jaati he
 Take care in this situation
 5- rangon se khelte vakt aksar logon ko apane sharir kii sud nahin rahati he
 They can also fall ill due to staying in water for a long time
 is dauraan unhen tej bukhaar yaa sard-garm kii vajah se zukam bhi ho saktaa he
 Let us know that the effect of colors can be different on every man
 kisi ko isse allergy nahin hoti he, kisi ko kam hoti he, to kisi ko zyada
 If someone is having any of the above symptoms, then instead of ignoring it, go to a nearby hospital and get your treatment immediately
 iske alaava zyada se zyada herbal rangon se khilne kii koshish karen or chemicalyukt rangon se khilne se bachein

 Campaign to stop illegal slaughterhouses in UP has stirred meat traders
 chunaav se pehle bijepi ne sankalp patr main avaidh boojadkhaanon ko band karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 This promise of BJP has got further strengthened after Yogi Adityanath became CM
 chunaav reliyon se lekar duusare saarvajanik manchon par yogi adityanath boojadkhaanon ko band karne kii vakaalat karte rahe hai
 This is the reason that as soon as the Yogi took the oath of CM on Sunday, the slaughter at the abattoirs started falling
 upi ke alag alag ilaakon main boojadkhaane sil kiye ja rahe hai
 However, no order has been formally given by the government in this regard
 upi main avaidh boojadkhaane band karnaa bijepi ke liye bhale hi chunavi mudde ko puraa karne kaa maamla ho
 But due to this, the employment crisis of millions of people will also arise
 ek report ke mutabik upi main philhal 40 boojadkhaane vaid hai
 These are the slaughterhouses that are licensed by the Central Government's Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA)
 jabaki ek report ke mutabik upi main avaidh boojadkhaanon kii sankhya saadhe teen sau se zyada he
 Please tell that UP is the largest exporter of buffalo meat in the country
 rojgaar par sankatpashchimi upi kii baat kii jaae to meerut, gajiabad or aligarh jilon main badi sankhya main boojadkhaane chalaae jate hai
 In the city of Meerut itself, large scale illegal abattoirs are being run under the cover of legitimate slaughterhouses
 in avaidh boojadkhaanon se hajaaron kii sankhya main logon kaa rojgaar judaa he
 In such a situation, if these slaughterhouses are closed, a large number of people will get employment crisis
 varanasi main bhi sankatvaranasi main bhi avaidh boojadkhaanon ko band karne kii karrwai kii ja rahi he
 On Tuesday, the police closed an illegal abattoir in Jaitpura area of varanasi
 yahaan bhi boojadkhaanon se badi sankhya main log jude hai
 The employment of about 15,000 people is associated with the abattoirs
 inamen zyaadaatar log aise hai jo pushton se meet kaatane kaa kaam karte aa rahe hai
 In such a situation, apart from this work, they do not seem to have an option of employment
 chamade ke vyapaar par asarkanpur ko upi kii aarthik rajdhani mana jaataa he
 Leather is a big business from Kanpur
 chamade kii belt se lekar bag or juute kanpur main banate hai
 Raw leather also goes from Kanpur across the country
 kanpur se kareeb har saal 12 arab dollar kaa chamade kaa saamaan videshon ko niryaat kiya jaataa he
 Only 6 slaughterhouses are legal here whereas the number of illegal slaughterhouses is more than fifty
 akele kanpur se har roj kareeb 50 karod ke gosht kaa vyapaar hota he
 Impact on farmers: The decision to close the slaughterhouses will not affect only the traders or laborers
 balki kisaanon par bhi iskaa vyapak asar padegaa
 According to the livestock population of 2012, there has been a huge increase in the number of buffalo and cow in UP
 2007 ke mukaable bhainson kii sankhya main 28 fisadi badhotaree hui jabaki gaay kii sankhya main 10 fisadi ijapha hua
 Raising cow and buffalo without milk is a big challenge for the farmer
 aamtaur par kisaan unheen maweshiyon ko apane paas rakhte hai jo yaa to kheti ke kaam main aate hai yaa jo dudharu hote hai
 Farmers sell the rest to other cattle
 aise maweshiyon ko chaara khilaanaa bhi kisaanon ke liye bada sankat mana jaataa he
 Closed slaughterhouse police administration has started shutting down illegal slaughterhouses
 somvaar ko gajraula main jab police avaidh meet kii dukaan band karaane pahunchi, to dukandaar ne carosine daalkar khud ko jalaane kii koshish kii
 However, the police immediately caught him
 iske baad mangalvaar ko elahabaad main do boojadkhaane sil karaae gaye
 While in the Kela Bhatta area of ghaziabad, the police closed 15 slaughterhouses
 upi main avaidh bachadkhaane band hone janata par vyapak asar padegaa
 In such a situation, Yogi Adityanath will have to fulfill his election promises and also find employment options for the people affected by this step

 ' sanjay singh ne kaha 'aam aadmi party ne devinder seharaavat ko teen baar 2013, 2014, 2015 main tikat diya

 The video can be seen written in bright red font - BJP leader with beef, Gujarat BJP expose: BJP car carrying beef caught

 This video is being shared on social media from October 2018
 is story ko likhe jane tak sakshi sharma ke fasebuk acount kii post ko kareeb 35 hajaar baar share kiya ja chukaa he
 The voiceover is of a male in a 54-second video
 use kisi naseem bhai ko sambodhit karte hue ‘big braking news’ ke bare main bataate hue suna ja saktaa he
 The voiceover claims that the beef was caught in the car of a BJP leader in Ahmedabad, Gujarat
 jis shaks kii aawaaj he use kisi 'naseem bhai' or darshakon se video ko share karne kii apil karte suna ja saktaa he
 They also said that 'local media is hiding this news
 'video ke 40wein second main do alag-alag photo screen par saamne aate hai
 In the first photo, two people can be seen sitting in a quartet on the ground
 unke aasapaas paanch or log hai, jinamein se ek ne police kii vardi pahan rakhi he
 In the second photo, a car filled something like meat
 car kii number plate par ‘camel’ kaa nishaan he or car kaa registration number gujarat kaa he
 On reverse search, we found that the video shows the part of Jharkhand in the first half
 jahaan june 2017 main alimuddin ansaari ko gaadi main kathith taur par gomance le jane ke liye peet-petakar maar daalaa gaya tha
 Ansari's car was also set on fire
 is ghatana ko tabapramukh media housesane cover kiya tha
 The person seen in the photo is Alimuddin Ansari
 kisi bhi media report main is baat kii pushti nahin kii gai ki ansaari kaa kabhi bhi bijepi se koi sambandh rahaa ho
 When we examined the other half of the video, we found that the car with the 'lotus sign' and the article written on the number plate of Gujarat were found on the website
 website ne pehali baar ghatana ko lekar2014 main likhaa or phir 2016 main apadet kiya
 
 isamen daawa kiya gaya ki car gujarat main bijepi ke sadasyon se judi he
 The website is no longer active and the number given on it is also no longer active
 kisi saakh vaale mukhya dhara ke media santhaan main is ghatana kaa zikr nahin dekhne ko mila
 India Today came to the conclusion that the related video was misleading, as if the first incident mentioned in it was from Jharkhand, not Gujarat
 saath hi photo main jo shaks dikhaaya gaya he vah bijepi kaaryakarta nahin he

 But once you become addicted to drinking alcohol, it becomes very difficult to quit it
 insaan bahut baar chahta he ki vah is gandi aadat ko chhod de lekin uskaa khud par niyantran hi nahin rah jaataa
 It does not take any time for any addict to become addictive and then a time comes when a human being trapped in its clutches and dies after mole

 Whenever you suffer from alcohol addiction, you can adopt these measures: 1
 kisi duusare kaam main khud ko uljhane kii koshish karenyah behad kargar or bharosemand upaay he
 If you feel the need to drink alcohol, then first try to indulge yourself in some other work
 aap chahen to paas ke hi kisi park main tahalne ja sakate hai, kitaab pard sakate hai yaa phir vyaayaam kaa sahaara le sakate hai
 2
 apano ke saath vakt bitaayensharab kii lat chhodane ke liye agar aap apano kii madad len to or bhi acha rahegaa

 When i heard the new verdict, i had tears in my eyes for a few moments, i screamed because after the 2013 verdict i had lost all hope of seeing this day
 main sochane laga ki ab shaayad mujhe khud ko sensor na karnaa pade
 As an artist, i will not compromise on how to show my community
 is faisle ne mujhe takat bhi di he ki main chupchaap apmaan ko pi na jaaun
 i thank God that the Supreme Court does not maintain a populist view, which our film industry is guilty of, not only in the gay fraternity but also in the case of women

 to kya sant kabir bazaar main khadey hokar isliye sabaki khayr maang rahe the
 
 
 The Did he know that there would come a day when the common man in the market would be craving to buy 'dal'
 kya vah jaanate the ki kanda-roti khaane vaale samaaj kii thali se kanda hi munh mode legaa
 
 
 And did he know that the powers of the market would one day take the throttle of the poor and all this would happen in those days, which we would characterize as 'good days'
 aaj jab ham kabir ke bazaar main khadaa hone or sabaki khayr maangane kii unki kavayad par vichaar karte hai to hamen digital, smart or vaishvik paridrishy main tarakkee karte bharat kaa cheharaa laachaar najar aata he, jisaki praathamikta main sab kuch he, sivaay daal roti or kanda ke
 We could not even imagine that pulses, the biggest source of protein for the poor, would sell for 200 rupees a day, we have already seen the history of onions
 pyaaj ne sarkaron kii chhaviyon ko bigaadane main apni bhoomika nibhaai he, isliye uski lagaataar 'vakri chaal' ko hamane ab apni niyati maan liya, lekin ab daal
 
 
 In the context of inflation of pulses, many analyzes have been done
 uske utpaadan se lekar bhandaaran tak kii kahaniyaan or chunavi rajyon main aaayaatit daal ko chunavi dangal bachaane ke liye bhej die jane kii khabaren bhi ham har vaazib angel se chhap chuke hai, lekin bada sawaal yah he ki aakhir aam logon kii zarurat kii chizon par hi sabase bada suniyojit hamalaa kyon ho rahaa he
 
 
 The kya yah har saal kii kahani nahin ban rahi ki ek vakt ke baad pyaaj kii keemten hamaare bas ke baahar kii ho jaaengi, kya hamaare nitiniyantaa aam logon kii zarurat kii chizon kaa sahi lekhajokha, utpaada, maang or aapurti ke aankade nahin rakh sakate, yaa aisi paristhitiyon main ek twarit yojana banaakar raahat nahin de sakate
 Do we see the crisis on the country only in the way that neighboring states attack our borders, but when the obscure forces of the market kill the people in such a way that it does not even appear to flow, then do we He feels his pain
 shaayad nahin, isliye har saal ham kuch khaas khaadya padaarthon, subjiyon, anaajon ke mahangaa hote jane ko chupchaap dekhte hai or nirlajj bhav se bayaan jari kar dete hai ki ab to nai fasal aane par hi keemten niyantran main aaengi
 Actually, one can feel the pain of lentils, who have bought pulses of one time from a grocery store or seen someone else
 haa, yah usee samaaj ke log hai, jo dinabhar kaa guzaara 25 yaa 32 rupee se neeche main kar lete hai or yadi inke ghar main kabhi galati se bhi maujuuda daur main daal ban bhi gai to ve sidhe garibi rekha se upar uth jate hai
 If they do not get up, then those people who dare to grow things like kanda-dal-vegetable
 bhayankar samaaj he hamaara or ajeeb isaki paristhitiyaan hai

 kya aapako yah soochna chaunkaati nahin ki jis daur main pyaaj 60 rupee kilo bik rahaa he, thik usee samay main mandi se pyaaj bechakar ghar lautaa kisaan isliye zehar pikar jaan de detaa he, kyonki use mandi main sahi daam nahin mili, or utane paison se vah karj chukaane main naakaabil he
 Is it not a tragedy at this time that the questions of farmers and farmers are missing from our discussions, which are directly related to the production of such goods
 kyon is bazaar main kisaan khud apane utpaada kii keemat tay nahin karata, uski kya majaburiyaan hai yaa banaai gai hai
 Why the market does not fulfill its promise of relief when products like Goya petrol-diesel are handed over to the market and when their prices in the international market are reduced for any reason
 
 
 ? kabir kaa bazaar aise logon ke liye kyon duusare maapdand akhriyaar kar letaa he
 You may find these things a bit old, similar to Manoj Kumar's patriotic film, but repeated events and circumstances make it seem that words like Kalabazari have not been erased from the dictionary, but rather with new concepts In front of temptation are appearing in the eyes, their new meanings and creations are being created by those who run the market in their own way
 yah shaq ab bharose main tabdeel hota ja rahaa he
 As lentils and things like that become more expensive, it will grow more and more
 ek or baat saaf karnaa chahta hum or is blog ko khatm karte-karte ek soochna dena chahta hum
 The first is that i am not against the market
 kabir kii tarah main bhi bazaar main khadaa hona chahta hum, lekin tab, jab vah krur vyavhaar nahin kare
 
 
 At least not with the resources to live life
 thik he, mujhe paneer nahin chahie, meri tarah karodon log bhi uske bina ji lenge, lekin kanda roti or daal meri zaruuratein hai, raham karo
 
 
 
 or soochna yah he ki madhya pradesh main aag lagane par kuan khod liya gaya he
 Preparations have been made to make pulses control act overnight
 chalo, sarkaar ne mana to ki kahin kuch gadabad he
 This is not because production has declined, but because the entire production is somewhere

 'please tell that Emma also has a son and after that she decided to be a Buddhist monk and she came to Bhutan

 On Tuesday morning, Union Minister Giriraj Singh targeted the Nitish Kumar's iftar and now jdu's KC Tyagi has hit back at him
 unhone kaha ki giriraaj kaa aacharan pradhanmantri narendra modi kii sikh ‘sabakaa vishwaas’ ke khilaaf he
 He said that he is sending him a picture, in which PM Modi is visiting with sheikh-imam inside the world's most beautiful mosque which is in Abu Dhabi
 unhone kaha ki ye sabakaa saath or sabakaa vishwaas kaa pratik he, us par giriraaj singh par kya kahenge
 KC Tyagi said that JDU and BJP leaders are organizing such programs, they are taking forward the thinking of PM Modi, Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and everyone's faith, but Giriraj's tweet is against PM Modi's thinking
 unhone kaha ki ham firaaq dil hindu hai or giriraaj singh tang dil hindu hai
 KC Tyagi replied that we celebrate the worship of Chhath in the same way, Sikhs also go to Pangat
 kasee tyaagi yahaan hi nahin ruke, unhone kaha ki piem modi ne pichley dinon sansad bhawan main kaha tha ki unki party ke kuch netaa hai jo din nikalate hi TV or akhabaaron kii surkhiyaan batorne ke liye anaap-shanaap bayaan dete hai

Prior to Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's first visit to India, the government on Friday pressurized the neighboring country to conduct a judicial inquiry into the role of Hafiz Saeed in the conspiracy of the Mumbai attack
 sarkaar ne kaha ki paryaapt saboot muhaiyaa karaane ke baavjood pakistan ne lashkar-e-taiyaba ke sargana par karrwai na karne kaa rasta apanaaya he
 External Affairs Minister SM Krishna told reporters here, "we have been saying for a long time that all the details of Hafiz Saeed's involvement in plotting and carrying out the terrorist attack in the documents that the Union Home Minister has provided to Pakistan
 is present
 " But Krishna said that unless the entire case is not judicially investigated and accountability is not fixed, he cannot be absolved of such refusal
 lekin durbhagyavash pakistan sarkaar ne isaki uchit jaanch karaane par dhyaan nahin diya
 Asked whether the issue would be discussed during Zardari's visit, Krishna said, "I don't know whether it will be discussed during Zardari's visit or not, but there is a possibility of discussion
" " Krishna's remarks came at a time when Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani had said in the National Assembly a day earlier that his government could not take action against Saeed without concrete evidence
 gilaani ne kaha tha ki said kaa mudda ek aantarik mudda he or yadi uske khilaaf koi thos saboot he to use pakistan ko muhaiyaa karaayaa janaa chahie

 He also said that the "real Rajdharma" of the government is that the farmers get a fair price for their produce
 sonia ne ek bayaan main kaha, '' bhaajapa sarkaar ne satta sambhalate hi dhokhe kii buniyaad rakh di thi
 He promised to give 50% of the profits to farmers as support price along with the cost
 lekin saal dar saal bhaajapa sarkaar mutthi bhar bichauliyon or jamaakhoron ko phayda pahunchaati rahi or anndaata kisaanon se lakhon karod rupee lootati rahi
 "he said," The question is why farmers are forced to celebrate Kali Deepawali on the day of Deepawali? Kharif crops in various mandis of the country are selling at less than eight percent to 37 percent of the support price
 yani kharif fasalon kii bikri kii dar samarthan mulya se ausatan 22

 While 2 crore people live in the country's capital Delhi, one crore vehicles are also registered

 In such a situation, discussions have been going on for the new parking policy of Delhi for the past several months

 The Transport Department of the Delhi government has suggested a charge for parking in residential areas in this draft
 vahiin, road or galiyon main park karne par charge badhaane kaa prastaav bhi rakhaa he
 However, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi seems to be in a mood to give relief to the general public

 According to Kailash Sankal, deputy mayor of South Delhi Municipal Corporation, we do not want to impose additional fees on anyone living in our area
 isliye emsidi ne dilli sarkaar ke is prastaav ko khaarij kar diya he
 People associated with RWA Association of Delhi say that the new policy should be such that can handle the problems of different areas
 sarkaar tay karegi har ghar main kitni gaadiyaan registerd ho sakati hai
 We spoke to RWA Association official Rajiv Kakaria who has sent suggestions on this issue from the RWA to the Lieutenant Governor
 rajeev kehete hai ki kevalavasiya kshetramen shulk lagane se parking vyavastha nahin sudharegi
 The government should decide how many vehicles are in which house and if there is no parking, then registration should not be done
 haalanki, parking export kehete hai ki ghar ke baahar parking tex lagaana samasya kaa hal nahin he, iske liye har kuch aria par multileval parking hub banani hogi
 Obviously, the people of Delhi have great hope of getting relief in parking from the new policy
