 i am Ravish Kumar
 itnaa to tay he ki hamaare kai netaa na to samvidhan thik se jaanate hai, na dharm kaa vidhaan
 Complete understanding of democracy is becoming confused
 koi netaa ko bhagwaan bataa rahaa he to koi virdohi ko rakshas
 At least Ramayana should be saved from such Tulsidas
 dikkat yah he ki pehali baar aise bayaan nahin aae hai, maafee hoti he, phir agle bayaan ke liye ye bayaan record se nikaale jate hai taaki virdohi ko chup karaayaa ja sake
 But all this happened in Delhi, that too in 21st century capital of India
 jiske rajouri vidhansabha kii ek chunavi sabha main kendriya mantri sadhvi niranjan jyoti ne kaha ki us par vah sansad ke donon sadanon main maafee maang chuki hai
 Otherwise, the minister was praising his statement on the news channels till morning
 unhone jo gaali di uskaa zikr to ho hi nahin saktaa, lekin afsos is baat kaa bhi he ki unhone ek gaali ke samanaantar ram ke naam kaa istamaal kiya
 Ramzada said
 yah saaf nahin ki unhone maafee gaali dene par maangi he yaa puure bhaashan se
 Because he also said that those who believe in Rama need a government
 desh ko maanane waalon kii sarkaar chahie
 Whether they are Muslims or Christians in this country, they are all children of Rama
 jo ye nahin maanate wo desh ko bhi nahin maanate
 So the definition of citizenship will be determined by the constitution or by such practices of a monk
 ram ko maanane waalon kii sarkaar kaa kya matlab he? jo vipaksh main he phir wo kise maanane vaala hai? or yah tay koun karegaa? kya yah naagarikta kii sanvaidhanik manyataon kaa mazaaq nahin he
 At a time when the BJP is winning in many states, the Prime Minister's popularity is at the peak
 aise bayaan kya yun hi nikal aa rahe hai
 Have the people of Delhi also liked this language
 venkaiya ne kaha ki niranjan jyoti garib parivaar se ai hai, unhen maafee ke baad chhod dena chahie
 So, is this rebate going to be given to bjp's Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi for his statements as well
 lekin giriraaj singh to padhe likhe hai
 For the first time, he has been made a minister at the Center, but has been a minister in Bihar
 unhone kejariwal kii tulana rakshas marich se kyon kii? giriraaj singh ne pradhanmantri ko ram kaha he
 When Devakant Barua called Indira is India, India is Indira, then the BJP caught the statement that it never left
 giriraaj kii yah tulana kya aadhyatmik he yaa sansaarik jo raajnneeti main rahane ke liye zaruri hota he
 Does Giriraj Singh not know that the Prime Minister himself has refused to touch his feet? lekin in sabake baad agar aise bayaan aaenge to kya aanch pradhanmantri tak nahin jaaegi
 Today, a statement from the Prime Minister has also come that mps should not address the names of the nation
 main is par samjhauta nahin karuunga
 In what context and to whom the spokesperson will clarify this
 in bayanon ke sandarbh main kya dilli kaa raajnneeti main koi nayaa pattern nazar aa rahaa he
 Is there a slippery of tongue or some strategy
 ek hi samay main do mantri ek hi tarah kii baaten kyon kar rahe the? kya niranjan jyoti or giriraaj singh donon ke hi bayaan phisal rahe the
 a fire broke out in a church in East Delhi's Dilshad Garden on Monday morning

 It is good that no party leader has given provocative talk
 lekin kahin in ghatnaon ke bahaane vyapak rup se aisi bahes paidaa karne kaa prayaas to nahin hai, jinke dam par sampradayik bhavukta paidaa kii ja sake
 The matter is being investigated
 jab sansad main kendriya rajyamantri niranjan jyoti ke bayaan par hangaamaa ho rahaa tha, tab sipiem netaa seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki mantri ke kilaaf exiaar honi chahie
 He cited a statement by Trinamool Congress MP Tapas Paul that despite his apology, the court ordered his arrest
 isi saal july main taapas paal ne kaha tha ki agar sipiem kaa koi bhi banda hamaari maa bahan ko chhedega to taapas paal nahin chhodega
 He will kill with a revolver
 main apane ladakon ko bhej kar unka rape karavaauungaa
 The Kolkata High Court had then said that this statement had crossed all limits
 inke khilaaf exiaar honi chahie
 Even after Tapas Paul apologized, the court said whom he had apologized to
 janata se yaa apni party se
 In the 43-page order, the court said that if a lawmaker breaks the law and the law-abiding agencies close their eyes, will it be tolerated by any civilized country
 bijepi or congress donon ne taapas kii giraftaar kii maang kii thi
 The minister has apologized
 giriraaj singh ne maafee nahin maangi he
 What gets our leaders restless to serve you public
 kahin aap janata hi to galat nahin hai
 It is not that you have started liking such language

 After declaring Nitish Kumar as the Chief Ministerial candidate from the 'secular Alliance' for the Bihar Assembly elections, the Janata Dal (U) challenged the BJP to be its chief ministerial candidate, saying that the saffron party had more than Nitish There is no face and he is also looking for 'kisi Kiran Bedi' in Bihar on the lines of Delhi
 jadyu mahasachiv or pravaktaa kasee tyaagi ne kaha, bhaajapa ke paas bihar main nitish kumaar kaa muqabla karne ke liye koi cheharaa is samay nahin he
 Now he is looking for a Kiran Bedi on the lines of Delhi too
 parantu itnaa kahana chahta hum ki jo haal dilli main kiran bedi kaa hua vahi haal bihar main bhaajapa kii kisi duusari ‘kiran bedi’ kaa bhi hoga
 Significantly, just before the Delhi Assembly elections earlier this year, the BJP had declared former IPS officer Kiran Bedi as the Chief Ministerial candidate, against Arvind Kejriwal of the Aam Aadmi Party, although he faced a crushing defeat in that election
 tyaagi ne abhinayta or bhaajapa netaa shatrughna sinha ke haalia bayaan kaa hawala dete hue bhaajapa ko chunauti di ki is saal bihar main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke liye mukhyamantri pad kaa apana ummidavaar ghoshit kare
 He said, BJP questions us every day for everything
 main unke ‘bayaanbaji ke badshaah’ susheel modi se poochna chahta hum ki bihar main unka cheharaa koun hoga
 Now BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha has also asked who is going to be the face of the party in the assembly elections
 tyaagi ne kaha, bhaajapa ke paas nitish ke mukaable koi cheharaa nahin he isliye vah baar-baar kah rahi he ki modi ke chehre par chunaav ladegi
 This will be the first time the assembly elections will be fought under the leadership of the Prime Minister
 meraa sawaal bhaajapa se yah he ki kya narendra modi pradhanmantri pad se istipha dekar bihar kaa mukhyamantri banenge? haal hi main ‘dharmanirpeksh gathbandhan’ ke dalon jadyu, rajd, congress or rakanpa kii ore se nitish kumaar ko aupchaarik rup se mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya gaya
 The comments tyaagi ne daawa kiya ki yah gathbandhan bihar vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa kaa rath rokane main kaamyaab hoga or vahiin se desh main ‘gairbhajapavad’kii shuruyaat hogi
 He said, we will stop bjp's chariot in Bihar
 bihar se gaiyr-bhaajapavad kii raajnneeti kii shuruyaat hogi
 Just as non-congressism started under the leadership of JP in the 1970s, so will non-congressism begin
 ab gaiyr-congresavad khatm ho chukaa hai or yah daur gaiyr-bhaajapavad kaa he
 The JDU leader said, this alliance has been tested in the by-elections in 10 assembly seats in Bihar just after the Lok Sabha elections
 us up-chunaav main is gathgandhan ne bhaajapa netaaon dwaara khaali kii gai 10 main se chah siten jiti thim
 Since then, Narendra Modi's popularity has decreased a lot and now our alliance has become stronger than before
 tyaagi ne siton ke bantwaarein ke mudde par kuch bhi bolne se inkaar kar diya
 JDU general secretary and spokesperson KC Tyagi said, BJP has no face to face Nitish Kumar in Bihar at this time
 ab vah dilli kii tarj par vahaan bhi kisi kiran bedi kii talash main he
 But i want to say that what happened to Kiran Bedi in Delhi will be similar to any other 'kiran Bedi' of BJP in Bihar
 gauratlab he ki is saal kii shuruyaat main dilli vidhansabha chunaav se ain pehle bhaajapa ne aam aadmi party ke arvind kejariwal ke mukaable purv ipies adhikari kiran bedi ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya tha, haalanki us chunaav main use karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Tyagi challenged the BJP to declare its chief ministerial candidate for the assembly elections to be held in Bihar this year, citing a recent statement by actor and BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha
 unhone kaha, bhaajapa hamase har cheez ke liye rojaanaa sawaal karti he
 i want to ask his 'king of rhetoric' Sushil Modi who will be his face in Bihar
 ab to bhaajapa ke saansad shatrughna sinha bhi puch chuke hai ki vidhansabha chunaav main party kaa cheharaa koun hone vaala he
 Tyagi said, BJP has no face in comparison to Nitish, so it is repeatedly saying that it will contest on Modi's face
 yah pehla mauka hoga jab vidhansabha chunaav pradhanmantri ke netritv main ladaa jayega
 My question to the BJP is whether Narendra Modi will resign from the post of Prime Minister and become the Chief Minister of Bihar? Recently, Nitish Kumar was formally declared as the Chief Ministerial candidate on behalf of JDU, RJD, Congress and NCP parties of 'secular Alliance'
 tippaniyan Tyagi claimed that this alliance will be successful in stopping the bjp's chariot in the Bihar assembly elections and from there, 'non-bjpism' will start in the country
 unhone kaha, ham bihar main bhaajapa kaa rath rokenge
 The politics of non-bjpism will begin in Bihar

 Jaitley said that in the coming years, there will eventually be a standard rate for general use goods in India, which will be between two standard rates of 12 percent and 18 percent
 iske saath aavashyak vastuon ke liye shunya pratishat or paanch pratishat kii maujuuda daren bani rahengi

 For example, except luxury and non-perishable items, other items are being phased out of the highest tax bracket of 28 per cent
 'unhone kaha, 'yah ek aisi dar hogi jo in donon ke bich main kahin hogi
 Of course, it will have to wait until the tax collection increases properly

 unhone kaha, 'jiesti daron ko tarksangat banane kaa ek bada kaam ho chukaa he

 'jetali ne kaha ki jiesti lagu hone se pehle adhiktar vastuon par 31 pratishat kaa kar lagata tha
 People had only two options - either pay more tax or tax evasion, he said that there was a lot of tax evasion at that time
 unhone jiesti ke maamle main sarkaar ke aalochakon par tanj kasate hue kiha, 'jin logon ne bharat ko 31 pratishat apratyaksh kar ke boj ke neeche dabaakar rakhaa tha or jo jiesti kaa uphaas karte rahe hai unhen apane andar jhaankna chahie

 What is the crime in this? Is it a crime to drink alcohol and possess a licensed gun? On the other hand, the BJP high command came into action after this video went viral

 Railways and airlines are taking out the bankruptcy of passengers this Diwali
 diwali par apane ghar jane ke liye pareshaan aam aadmi kii bebasii kaa phayda airlines ke saath-saath bhartiya railway bhi uthaa rahi he
 The surprising thing is that the railways have announced to run dozens of special trains in view of the festive crowd, but the fare of these special trains is 25 to 50 percent more
 kiraye main ho rahi anaap-shanaap badhotareegar hawaii yatra kii baat karen to yahaan bhi logon kii jeb kaati ja rahi he
 Airlines have increased the fare for places where demand is high
 masalan dilli se lakhanu ke liye hi hawaii kiraaya 26 se 27 hajaar tak pahunch chuke hai
 That is, in the biggest festival of Hindustani, Diwali, Railways and Airlines are taking out the bankruptcy of passengers
 suvidha ke naam par vasuul rahi kiraayis baar tyohaari sijan ko dekhte huerelvene pichley 1 maheene se har din nai-nai special train chalaane kii ghoshnaa kii he
 For the convenience of the passengers, the railway is moving its boast, that it has provided trains according to the needs of the people in the festive season
 lekin asaliyat yah he rail yatriyon ko suvidha dene ke naam par jo trainen chalaai ja rahi hai, unamem se zyaadaatar trainen festival special or suvidha trainen hai
 The biggest thing is that even though these festival special trains are going somewhere, but these are premium trains i
e
 in this the passenger will have to pay the normal fare as well as Tatkal charges
 isi tarah tyohaari maang ko dekhte hue jo suvidha trainen chalaai gai hai, unamem sarj prising kaa formula pehle se hi lagu he
 Their fare increases after 20 per cent of seats in pure trains are filled
 suvidha trainon main sabase ant main jo tikat book hote hai, wo der se doguna mahange hote hai
 Why do express trains not have coaches? This simply means that in the name of running special trains in the festive season, Indian Railways is cutting the pocket of common man
 sabase badi baat ye he ki jab special trainon ke dibbe pehle se hi maujuud hote hai to inhen express gadiyon main kyon nahin lagaaya jaataa he
 There are many express trains which run with less than 24 coaches of their normal capacity
 aise main sawaal ye uthta he kii railway maujuuda gadiyon main hi dibbe kyon nahin badhaata
 Why dare to declare special trains separately? uttar railway ne utaarin 150 atirikt trainenis sawaal kaa jawaab sidhaa sa he ki rail mantralay ko ham hindustani se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Northern Railway has recently announced to run 150 additional trains
 10 jodi trainen suvidha train he or 7 jodi trene special train he
 In such a situation, for the people going to their home to celebrate Diwali in the festive season, the minister is not only the Lord Prabhu but the support of the Lord above
 zyada kiraaya lekin suvidha kamaspecial trainon se yatra karne vaale yatriyon kaa kahana he ki zyada kiraaya dene ke baavjood na to in trainon main cataring kii suvidha he or na hi is baat kii guarantee he ki ye train he rhite time apane destination par pahunch jaaengi
 According to Manoj Verma, a railway passenger who has booked a special train ticket from Delhi to Patna, the railway is taking advantage of the common man's helplessness like private companies, despite the losses, the railway is not able to increase the fare but whenever the opportunity comes
 It is not drying up by taking advantage of the helplessness of the common man
 unka kahana he agar unase zyada kiraaya vasuulana he, to is special train chalaane ke elaan ke vakt yah bhi bataaya janaa chahie ki in trainon ke liye zyada paisa vasula ja rahaa he
 Airlines have also been robbed
 Airlines have also started taking advantage of this opportunity
 dilli-lakhanu ke jis root par aamtaur par dhaai se teen hajaar kaa tikat miltaa he, vahaan kaa hawaii kiraaya 26 se 27 hajaar rupee tak pahunch gaya he
 Whereas Jet Airways is taking 27,841, the fare of airindia has reached 26,429

 Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Ravish Kumar said in a tweet, "foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj met Myanmar President u Win Mint, a key partner in Act East Policy, as part of her first program in Myanmar
 "myanmar bharat ke ranneetik rup se mahatvapurn padosi deshon main shaamil he or hamase1,640 kilometrelambi seemaa saajha karata he

 " During his presidential speech at the BJP National Council meeting on August 9 at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi, party president Amit Shah hinted at the party's strategy for the Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, but then most political analysts could catch it
 Failed agar shivasena tab shah ke shabdon ko gaur se sun rahi hoti to shaayad vah siton ke bantwaare ko lekar bijepi ke saath na is tarah uljhi hoti or na gathbandhan tuutane kii naubat aati
 In his speech, Amit Shah had said in the context of assembly elections in four states that the party would have to take the lead in forming the government in all these states, and Shah did not stop here only
 unhone 'surajya' dene ke bare main bhi ek behad mahatvapurn baat kahi thi
 He had said, "as BJP worker, it is our ultimate duty to give good governance to all countrymen
 
 
 magar is kartavya kaa paalan tabhi ho paaegaa, jab kashmir se kanyakumari or kuccha se kohima tak har pradesh main bijepi yaa bijepi ke netritv vaali sarkarein hongi
 
 
 " ab zaraa in shabdon par gaur farmaaen
 Amit Shah was clearly saying that either the BJP has its own government or it is bjp-led
 yani, agar gathbandhan kii sarkaar bhi bani to uski aguwai bijepi hi karegi
 This was to set a major goal for its cadres by the president of the party that won a majority on its own
 vah saaf kah rahe the ki centre main sabase badi party ab rajyon main chote or kshetreey dalon kii pichhalggu nahin bani rahegi
 She will ask for the right according to her strength
 ek jati, kshetra, bhashaa yaa dharm kii raajnneeti karne vaali, vanshavaad par chalane vaali kshetreey partiyon ke saamne bijepi ab nae avatar main aegi
 
 
 
 or aisa hi hua
 
 
 The BJP, which reduced its share in the Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra and gave more seats to the Shiv Sena and allies, reminded the Shiv Sena this time that its base in the state has been strengthened
 lambii baatcheet ke baad aakhirkaar bijepi ne shivasena ke saamne 147-127-14 kaa formula rakhaa
 Significantly, the BJP contested 119 seats in the last assembly election, so the party wanted only eight seats more and it also wanted the Shiv Sena to give 14 seats to its allies from its quota
 thik vaise hi, jaise bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav main siton kaa apana hissaa kam kiya, lekin uddhav thakare 151 se neeche jane ke liye kisi surat main taiyaar nahin hue
 That is, it can be said that Shiv Sena for four seats and BJP for eight seats broke this alliance
 magar asli pench mukhyamantri pad ko lekar hi rahaa, kyonki shivasena ko lagata tha ki kam siton par ladane ke baavjood bijepi usase zyada siten jitkar mukhyamantri pad par daavedaari kar sakati he
 The story of Haryana is even more interesting
 gaiyr-jat voton kii kilabandi karne ke liye bijepi ne kuch saal pehle kuldeep bishnoi ke saath vicitra samjhauta kiya tha
 Long before the Lok sabha-assembly elections with a small regional party with only one MP, an agreement was reached that the BJP would contest eight seats in the Lok Sabha and Haryana Janhit Congress in two seats, while in the Assembly both would contest 45–45 seats and a half and a half
 Both parties will have a chief minister for the year
 tab bhi kai logon ko laga ki bijepi ne bishnoi ko unki takat se zyada de diya, lekin loksabhaa chunaav main aae nateezon ne isaki pushti kii, jab bijepi ne aath main se saat siten jeet leen, magar modi lahar ke baavjood bishnoi kii party donon siten haar gai
 Despite this, the BJP offered 20 assembly seats in front of Bishnoi to prevent the scattering of non-jat votes
 party ne yah bhi kaha ki upmukhyamantri kaa pad haryana janhit congress ko diya ja saktaa he, lekin bishnoi iske liye taiyaar nahin hue
 The results will come on Sunday, but the exit polls are not giving a very good picture about Bishnoi's party
 unhen shunya se lekar paanch siten milane kii sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he
 That is, the party which is not able to get even five seats in Haryana on its own, does not know what the agreement was to give 45 seats
 yahi amit shah kii bijepi he
 Forgetting defeat in the by-elections in Uttarakhand, Bihar and then Uttar Pradesh, this BJP, which is waiting for the results of Haryana and Maharashtra, is confident that the new BJP will gain momentum from Sunday onwards
 yah jarur he ki pashchim bengal, tamilnadu, odisha jaise rajyon main shaayad bijepi yaa bijepi ke netritv kii sarkaar banane kaa unka lakshya asambhav lagata he, magar haryana or maharashtra main agar bijepi apane boote sarkaar banane main kaamyaab hoti he to jharkhand or jammu-kashmir ke chunaavon main party nae hausale ke saath maidan main utregi
 And for the subsequent states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, it will get new energy and strength
 party kaa lakshya 'congressmukt rajyasabha' he
 In simple language, she wants her to get a majority in the Rajya Sabha so that she can get the law made in Parliament on her own before the next Lok Sabha elections
 iske liye bhi rajyon kii ladaai jeetna uske liye jaruri he, or amit shah isi disha main kaam kar rahe hai

 26–11 attacks
 
 
 mumbai kii trainon par hue aatanki hamale
 
 
 Attacks on Srinagar airports
 
 
 
 
 
 
 or yah to sirf ek choti si baangi he
 But what is most worrying is how some sections of Pakistan are trying to mainstream this dangerous terrorist named Hafiz Saeed
 isko lekar pakistan kya kar rahaa he, iske bare main jaankaree kuch der main
 It is necessary to first know how much Hafiz Saeed has been in the mainstream of Pakistani politics for the last two decades
 pakistan kii sena or iesai se said ke rishte jagajaahir hai, lekin un mukhyadhara ke raajnneetik netaaon kaa kya jo use pakistan ke liye itnaa mahatvapurn banaate hai?usne dipha-e-pakistan kaa gathan kiya he, jiske antargat 40 aatanki gut aate hai
 Its supporters are also present in large numbers in the political parties of the mainstream as well as terrorist groups
 taharik-e-insaaf ke mukhiya imran khan ko hafiz said kaa bahut kareebi mana jaataa he or party ke upaadhyaksh ejaj choudhary to said ke lagbhag har karykram main hissaa lete hai
 Nawaz Sharif, his brother and Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif are also considered very close to Saeed
 said kaa kaaryakshetra bhi mukhya taur par punjab hi he
 Rather, Saeed has a relationship with the Sharif family since the 80s
 said navaj sharif ke pita kaa kareebi rahaa he or donon kaa sambandh tabalig-e-jamaat se rahaa he
 But the most worrying signs are coming from the Pakistani government and security agencies themselves
 or wo bhi america kii taraf se 1 karod america dollar kaa inam ghoshit kiye jane ke baad! pakistan ke ek adhikari ne kaha he ki hafiz said un aatanvaadiyon ko raah dikhne kaa kaam kar rahe hai jo mukhyadhara me aane ke khwaahishamand hai
 Hafiz Saeed is also providing a teacher for this! Now, what kind of training a terrorist himself will give to wandering youth can only be guessed
 dilachasp baat yah he ki jahaan pakistani sarkaar is tarah ke bayanaat de rahi he, khud jamaat ut daawa is baat se inkaar karti he
 Jamaat Ut Dawa spokesman Yahya Mujahid and another senior Hafiz Khalid Walid of the organization have denied this
 magar wo yah zarur kah rahe hai ki ahimsa or shaanti failaane ke liye wo aham kirdaar adaa kar rahe hai
 Hafiz Saeed and non-violence? What could be more ridiculous than this? And such earnest on behalf of Pakistani administration is also showing his so-called bona fides
 isse yahi pataa chalata he ki hafiz said ko lekar pakistan kaa ravaiyya vahi dhak ke teen paat
 The same ostentatious attitude! And India cannot ignore this
 haalanki zaradaari or manmohan ke lunch kaa jaayaka is baat se bighad jaae, isaki ummiden bahut kam hai
 Home Minister Chidambaram said that since it is a private visit, the visit will not be hurt by issues like Hafiz Saeed
 
 
 
 ! And this statement from the person representing the battle of India in 26-11
 to saafe he ki hafiz said par charchaa kisi or din! yah to mauka he 7 res course road main manmohan kii mez par parose pakwaanon kaa lutf uthaane kaa! The issue of taking the law of the angry mob in your hand is not only heard in India but in many countries of the world

 Mormalind is in Sorong district of Indonesia, where an angry mob with a knife, hammer and sticks reached a crocodile farm to avenge the death of an alligator and killed 292 crocodiles while attacking them swiftly
 sthaneey adhikariyon ne bataaya ki badale kii aag menmagaramachhonko maarane kii yah ghatana shanivaar ko papua praant main maare gaye shaks ke antim sanskaar ke baad ghati
 Police and conservation officials say the 48-year-old man went to find grass to feed his cattle when he fell into an enclosure of crocodiles
 unhone bataaya ki magaramchh ne mritak sugito ke ek pair ko kaat liya tha or ek magaramchh ke pichley hisse se takaraakar uski maut ho gai
 Officials said Sugito's relatives and local residents, angry about the presence of the farm near the residential area, reached the local police station
 sthaneey sangrakshan agency ke pramukh basar manulang ne kaha ki unhen bataaya gaya tha ki farm muaavja dene ko taiyaar he
 Unsatisfied crowds reached the farm with knives, razors and spuds and killed 292 crocodiles ranging from four-inch-tall children up to two meters, officials said
 police or sangrakshan adhikariyon kaa kahana tha ki vah gussai bheed ko roak paane main asamarth thi
 Officials said they are investigating it and criminal charges can also be framed

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which started it, is an attacker on the Congress on this whole issue
 bijepi ke purv meyar ashok lahoti ne kaha ki congress raashtragan or raashtragit kii virdohi he, jisaki vajah se nagar nigam kii acchhee parampara band kar di gai he
 Lahoti has alleged that this tradition was started in the Jaipur Municipal Corporation during the BJP regime to instill a sense of patriotism among the people and bring discipline to the workplace, but the Congress has been opposing it from the beginning
 yahi vajah he ki jaanboojhkar mashin kii kharabi ke naam par ise band kiya gaya he
 He said that if it is not started back then BJP will agitate
 haalanki, jaipur ke maujuuda meyar vishnu lata kaa kahana he ki yah takneekee kami kii vajah se band hui he, ise band nahin kiya gaya he
 He told that the instruments of the reel company were engaged in the Municipal Corporation which used to play in all the rooms and as soon as it was done, people got up from their chairs to sing the national anthem and the national anthem, but there was a sudden malfunction in the machine, due to which the national anthem and The national anthem is not able to play the song, however anyone who wants to sing can sing on their seat
 meyar vishnu lata ne bataaya ki hamane company ko isaki jaankaree di he or company ne vaada kiya he ki do din ke andar mashin ko thik kar diya jayega
 Lata has accused the BJP of deliberately coloring the case politically
 gauratlab he ki bijepi shashan ke dauraan nagar nigam main din kii shuruyaat raashtragit se karne or daftar khatm hone ke samay raashtragan gane kii parampara shuru hui thi, jiskaa tab kai muslim parshadon ne virodh bhi kiya tha
 After this, such a tradition was started in many parts of the country

 Robert Vadra, the brother-in-law of Congress President Rahul Gandhi, on Wednesday alleged that the investigation into the corruption case against him is the result of political vendetta and all this is being done with the aim of tarnishing his image

 Vadra has called it a media circus to divert public attention
 unhone apni post main likhaa ki adhikariyon ko acchhee tarah se pataa he ki unke khilaaf aage badhane ke liye koi cese nahin he
 The charges leveled against him are politically motivated and a conspiracy to defame him

 Vadra further wrote that he has provided all the necessary dossiers demanded by the investigating agencies

 Vadra said that his lawyer was forced to appear in Jaipur once again

 The Rajasthan government has already canceled the deal

 On Nitish's statement, Modi asked that if the minimum wages were given to the laborers by the state government in Bihar, why would they go to Gujarat in search of employment
 unhone kaha ki bihar main sarkari aankade ke mutabik kya mazdooree di jaati he, uskaa koi matlab nahin
 If people got minimum wages of 100 rupees here then why would people go to Gujarat in search of employment
 bagaha main police golibari main chah logon kii maut ke virodh main patna ke kargil chowk par bijevi ke anya netaaon ke saath dharna par baithe party ke varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki tharu samaaj ke 5 hajaar se adhik log gujarat main mazdooree karte hai
 He said that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar Tharu should publicly apologize to the people of Bagaha police firing and the state government should give Rs 10 lakh as compensation to the dependents of the deceased

 Sushil Kumar Modi said that the condition of one of the seven people injured in this shootout remains critical
 unhone kaha ki is ghatana ke baad se bagaha main dehshat kaa maahaul he or police dwaara is maamle main vahaan 700 agyaat logon ke khilaaf praathmiki darj karaaye jane ke baad se log apane-apane gharon ko chhodkar bhaag rahe hai
 Modi said that if the government tries to arrest innocent people, it can have serious consequences and if within seven days the demands of the Tharu society are not met then they will sit on a 24-hour fast in Patna
 bhagalpur ke bijepi saansad shahanvaj hossain dwaara yah kahe jane par ki nitish mantrimandal main bijepi mantriyon ko kaam karne kii aazaadee nahin thi, iske bare main puche jane par modi ne kaha ki in baton kaa jawaab dene kaa yah uchit samay nahin he, uchit samay par jawaab diya jayega

 '' desh ke alag-alag raajnneetik dalon kii 11 mahila saansadon ne rajyasabha ke sabhapati ko niyam 267 ke tahat kaarysthgan kaa notice dekar mahila aarakshan bill ke mudde par charchaa kii maang kii he
 Apart from five women mps, including Congress's Kumari Selja, to discuss the bill, ncp's Vandana Chauhan, tmc's Shanta Chhetri, rjd's Misa Bharti, dmk's Kanimozhi and cpm's Jharana Das have given notice to the Chairman of Rajya Sabha
 dilachasp baat yah he ki is mudde par charchaa kii maang karne vaali mahila netaaon main misa bharti bhi shaamil hai, jo argedy pramukh lalu prasad yadav kii beti hai
 Lalu is among those leaders who have been raising their voice against the Women's Reservation Bill for a long time
 kai dashakon se sansad main latake mahila aarakshan bill kii raah main ve bada roda maane jate rahe hai
 Explain that the 33% reservation bill for women in the Rajya Sabha was passed in 2010, but due to heavy opposition from parties like SP, BSP and RJD in the Lok Sabha, this bill could not be passed
 gauratlab he mahila aarakshan bill do dashakon se zyada vakt se atka hua he
 The bill was introduced for the first time in 1996 and passed from the Rajya Sabha in 2010 but was not passed by the Lok Sabha
 sapa, basapa or argedy kaa virodh or cote ke bheetar cote kii maang ke chalate ye bill aaj tak paas nahin ho sakaa he
 The Women's Reservation Bill was first introduced by the Deve Gowda government in 1996 in Parliament and was strongly opposed by many male mps
 iske baad 2010 main sansad main dobaaraa pesh hone ke baad rajyasabha main bill paas hua, lekin loksabhaa main aarakshan bill paas nahin ho paaya tha
 Actually parties like SP, BSP and RJD are demanding quota within quota for Dalit, OBC women
 unka tark he ki savarna or dalit, obisi mahilaon kii saamaajik haalat main fark hota he
 However, after the Modi government came to power, former Congress president Sonia Gandhi and current president Rahul Gandhi wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanding the passage of the Women's Reservation Bill
 itnaa hi nahin unhone is bill par samarthan dene kii bhi baat kahi thi, iske baavjood abhi tak is bill ko loksabhaa se paas nahin karaayaa ja sakaa he

 pyaar, mohabbat, ishk
 These are the feelings that reside in every heart
 ye wo jajba he, jo kaaynaat ke jarre-jarre main bikharaa hua he
 And hatred also hates love

 Wanted to marry her

 All was well, but one day that madam Aashiq enters a house

 Then the murder of a 9-year-old innocent girl present in a room
 uske baad wo usee ghar main 23 saal kii ek yuvati ko chaaku se god daalata he
 Brutally murders him
 aakhir koun tha wo sirphira kaatil, jisane ek saath tripal murder ko anjaam de daalaa
 Actually, this incident is from Brahmapuri area of delhi
 jahaan sairabano naamak mahila apni do betiyon ke saath rahati thi
 Her elder daughter Mahrunisha was friendly with Hyder, a young man living in the neighborhood
 isi dauraan baat aage badi or haidar ne mahru ke saath shaadi kaa vaada kar liya
 Sairabano also agreed to this relationship
 shaadi kii taiyaari shuru hoti isse pehle hi mahru kii zindagi main ek tisare shaks kii entry ho gaya, jo uskaa nayaa aashiq tha
 Because of that, Mehru kept distance from Hyder
 wo usase baat bhi nahin karti thi
 One day Hyder saw both of them together
 tab bhi usne mahru ko samajhane kii koshish kii lekin wo nahin maani
 Angered by this, Hyder hatched a bloody conspiracy
 bevafaayee se tang aakar usne ek saath mahru, uski maa sairabano or 9 saal kii bahan shabnam ko katl kar daalaa
 After this, he put all the three corpses in a room and turned on all the acs there
 usne ghar se saare saboot mitaane kii koshish bhi kii or phir ghar ko baahar se taala markar faraar ho gaya
 Three days later, when the smell started coming from the house, the locals reported to the police
 police ne aakar jab kamare kaa taala todaa to kamare kaa manjar dekhakar pulisavaalon ke hosh ud gaye
 The police began investigating the case
 to ek ke baad ek taar judate chale gaye or sirphira aashiq haidar pakadaa gaya
 The formula for the sharing of ministries in the Maharashtra government has not yet been confirmed to the names of 16 NCP, 15 to the Shiv Sena and 12 to the Congress' portfolios
 teenon partiyon ke bich mantralayon ko lekar sahmati ban gai he
 Whereas the Nationalist Congress Party will have the maximum number of Ministries in the Government of Maharashtra, the Congress Party has the least
 ensipi ke paas 16 mantralay, shivasena ke paas 15 or congress ke paas 12 mantralay honge
 However, no decision has been made so far on cabinet expansion

 Earlier sources claimed that Shiv Sena could get ministries like Urban Development, Housing, Irrigation and maharashtrastate Road Development Corporation (MSRDC)
 jabaki ensipi grih, vitt, yojana, bijli or van mantralay jaise pad apane paas rakh sakati he
 On the other hand, Congress is likely to get revenue, PDWD and excise ministry

 Under the coalition formula, NCP has been given the post of deputy CM, but so far no one has been appointed on it
 saath hi uddhav cabinet kaa vistaar bhi abhi tak nahin ho sakaa he
 There is a discussion that a final consensus has not been reached on the ministries
 aaj tak ke saath hue khaas intervyuu main jab sharad pavaar se is mudde par jab sawaal kiya gaya tha to unhone sidhe taur parashivasena or congresske paale main gend daal di
 Actually, Sharad Pawar had said that there is no quarrel between his party NCP and Shiv Sena regarding the ministry
 yah congress or ensipi ke bich he
 Pawar said the NCP has two seats less than the Shiv Sena, while the Congress has 10 seats more
 unhone kaha, 'shivasena ke paas mukhyamantri he jabaki congress ke paas spikar he
 But what did my party get

 RK Dhawan, a close aide of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, has made some important revelations during the Emergency period
 dhawan ne menka gandhi ke bare main kaha ki ve sanjay gandhi ke saath har jagah jaati thim, isliye unhen har us cheez kii jaankaree thi, jo sanjay ne apatkaal ke dauraan kiya tha
 Dhawan said that Maneka Gandhi knew what Sanjay was doing
 unhen puri jaankaree thi
 She said that she could no longer claim that she did not know anything
 menka ab bijepi main hai or kendriya mantri hai
 The election was ordered by majority Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1977 after an emergency was ordered in an intelligence report predicting a majority and felt relieved after losing the election
 dhawan ne yah bhi kaha ki pashchim bengal ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri siddharth shankar re apatkaal ke shilpkaar the, jinhone indira gandhi par desh main vyaapt halaat par kaabo karne ke liye kuch kathor kadam uthaane ke liye jor daalaa tha
 Dhawan said that Indira Gandhi never felt that Sanjay Gandhi was responsible for her defeat in any way
 vahapatkalake dauraan apane bete kii gatividhiyon se waakif bhi nahin thim or un tak kabhi sanjay ke khilaaf koi shikaayat pahunchi bhi nahin
 CM and bureaucrats used to make gestures, Dhawan, a former assistant to Sanjay Indira Gandhi, told a program by Karan Thapar on India Today TV that Sanjay Gandhi was run by some chief ministers and bureaucrats on his own gestures, saying that he was more than his mother Being powerful, he used to feel that he draws more crowds
 yah baat sanjay ke man main ghar kar gai thi
 RK Dhawan, who was Indira Gandhi's personal secretary, said Indira was having dinner when i told her that she had lost
 unke chehre par raahat kaa bhav tha
 There was no sadness or wrinkle on his face
 unhone kaha tha, 'bhagwaan kaa shukr he, mere paas apane liye samay hoga
 'history is not doing justice to Indira! Dhawan claimed that history is not doing justice to Indira and the leaders defame her because of her selfishness
 unhone kaha ki vah rashtravaadi thim or apane desh ke logon se unhen bahut pyaar tha
 She said she was confident of that IB report that she would win a majority
 pien dhar ne unhen khufia beuro kii ek report saunpi thi jiske tatkaal baad unhone chunaavon kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 Even SS Ray had predicted that Indira would get 340 seats
 dhawan ne kaha ki re ne apatkaal ke bahut pehle indira ko patr likh kar kuch kade kadam uthaane kaa suzav diya tha
 He had also said that the then President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed had no objection to signing the proclamation to implement the Emergency
 dhawan ne bataaya ki jab indira ne june 1975 main apana chunaav radd kiye jane kaa elahabaad hoicourt kaa aadesh suna tha, to unki pehali pratikriya istife kii thi or unhone apana tyaagptr likhvaya tha
 He said he typed the resignation, but was never signed
 aisa isliye hua kyonki unke mantrimandaleey sahyogi unase milane aae or sabane jor diya ki unhen istipha nahin dena chahie

 filmkaar adur gopala krishnan ne soochna or prasaaran mantri arun jetali ke khilaaf apatiai maamle main aawaaj uthaai he
 a few days ago, FTII students accused Information and Broadcasting Minister Arun Jaitley of threatening to privatize the institute by closing India's largest and prestigious film institute, APTI
 apatiai chaatro ne aarope lagaaya ki jetali ne dilli main maamle kaa samaadhaan dhundne ke liye bulaai gai meeting main ishaara kiya tha ki agar apatiai ke chaatr gajendra chouhan maamle main apni hadtaal waapas nahin lete hai, to institute band bhi ho saktaa he
 But, now in this case, in support of the students, filmmaker Adoor Gopala Krishnan has told NDTV that FTII can neither be closed nor privatized
 filmkaar adur gopala krishanan ne centre kii aalochana karte hue bataaya ki sarkaar ko gajendra chouhan ko apatiai kaa adhyaksh bananaa ke faisle ko waapas lenaa hoga
 We have no enmity with Gajendra
 wo achche insaan hai, lekin hamen aisa insaan chahie jo apatiai ko nai bulandiyon tar pahunchaa sake
 The comments gajendra chouhan kii adhyakshata se uthe vivaad ko lekar pallavi joshi, jahnu barua, santosh sivan ne jahaan apatiai socity kii sadsyta manaa kii he, vahiin nikhil adwani, kiran raav se lekar bollywood superstar ranbir kapur ne bhi gajendra chouhan ke khilaaf morcha kholaa he
 Adoor told NDTV that i would appeal to Gajendra Chauhan himself to step down as the FTII chairman, as his position would harm the FTII
 apatiai chaatr hadtaal waapas lene ke mood main nahin or aise main sarkaar ko jald se jald is maamle kaa samaadhaan dhundhna hoga
 FTII students alleged that Jaitley had indicated in a meeting convened in Delhi to find a solution to the case that if the FTII student Gajendra Chauhan did not withdraw his strike in the case, the institute could also be closed
 lekin, ab is maamle main chaatro ke samarthan main filmkaar adur gopala krishanan ne enditivi ko kaha he ki apatiai ko naa to band kiya ja saktaa he naa hi iskaa nijeekaran kiya ja saktaa he
 Filmmaker Adoor Gopala Krishnan criticized the Center saying that the government would have to withdraw the decision to make Gajendra Chauhan the chairman of FTII
 ham ko gajendra se koi dushmani nahin
 He is a good man, but we need a person who can take new heights to FTII
 tippaniyan While Pallavi Joshi, Jahnu Barua, Santosh Sivan have denied membership of the FTII Society over the controversy arising under the chairmanship of Gajendra Chauhan, Nikhil Advani, Kiran Rao to Bollywood superstar Ranbir Kapoor have also opened a front against Gajendra Chauhan
 adur ne NDTV ko kaha ki main khud gajendra chouhan ko apil karuunga ki wo apatiai adhyaksh kaa pad chhod den, kyonki unke pad par bane rahane se apatiai kaa nuksaan hoga
 FTII students are not in the mood to withdraw the strike and the government will have to find a solution to this matter at the earliest

 modi sarkaar ko satta main aae abhi saat maheene hi beete hai, lekin ab tak aath maamalon par adhyadesh laa chuki he
 The ordinance recently introduced on the Land Acquisition Bill is also one of them
 sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr ne kaledhan or dharmantaran ke mudde par kaaphi hangaame dekhe
 Opposition parties also showed fresh new ways of protesting
 vipaksh vibhinn muddon par pradhanmantri ke bayaan kii maang karata rahaa
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu could not convince the opposition and big bills were hanged
 1984 kii rajeev gandhi sarkaar ke baad sidhaa 2014 main modi sarkaar ko itnaa bada bahumat praapt hua he
 But, the government is bringing the ordinance in the Parliament, not following the path of debate and vote
 aakhir iskaa kya kaaran he? modi sarkaar ne sansad ke agle satr kaa intazaar kyon nahin kiya? It seems that the government is suffering the brunt of the acts of its own allied organizations and mps
 dharmantaran ke mudde par sarkaar vishwa hindu parishad or apane hi saansadon ke bayanon par safaaiyaan pesh karti rahi
 On the issue of black money, the Prime Minister went on radio unilaterally, but avoided speaking in Parliament
 sansad puure 22 din ke liye baithi or chhitput vidheyak bhi paas hote rahe, lekin desh kii arthvyavastha se sambandhit khaas vidheyak vivaadon par safaaiyaan puri hone kaa intazaar karte rahe
 Our constitution has suggested the way of ordinance
 kisi bhi vidheyak ko paarit karne kaa ye asthaayee tarika he
 Under Article 123 of the Constitution, the President can issue an ordinance at the behest of the government, when neither of the two houses is in session
 koi bhi adhyadesh sadan ke agle satr ke ant ke baad chah hafton tak bana rahata he
 Whatever bill the ordinance is brought on, it has to be passed through voting in the next session of Parliament
 agar aisa nahin hota he to raashtrapati ise dobaaraa bhi jari kar sakate hai
 The creators of the constitution made the path of the ordinance thinking that necessary bills can be passed in an emergency
 in sthitiyon ke udhaaharan indira gandhi sarkaar dwaara lagaai gai immergency or wo samay jab 1996 se lekar 1998 tak sarkaar girane-banane kaa daur chal rahaa tha
 These ordinances have been issued in previous governments as well, but the Modi government is far ahead of the Manmohan government in this matter
 manmohan sarkaar ne khaadya suraksha par adhyadesh laayaa tha
 At that time, Arun Jaitley was strongly opposed to it while in opposition
 us vaqt unhen ye upie sarkaar kii jaldbaazi lag rahi thi or ab apni sarkaar main unka kahana he ki bhoomi adhigrahan par adhyadesh desh ke vikaas ke liye zaruri he
 The Land Acquisition Bill has been passed at the time of the UPA itself, on which the BJP too had approved its consent
 ek saal ke andar aisa kya ho gaya ki bijepi ko isamen sanshodhan laane ke liye shortkat kii zarurat pad rahi he
 Parliament is supreme and if only ordinances are passed at this pace, then the trend of debate on the bills will end
 aise kai vidheyak honge jinamein sudhaar kii gunjaaish he, jis par sansad main charchaa aavashyak he lekin sarkaar use adhyadesh ke zariye paarit karke aage badhanaa chaahati he
 Thus wrong or right, the new law will start its work from the day the ordinance is issued
 lekin sirf sarkaar ko dosha dene kii bajaay vipaksh ko apni raajnneeti ko bhi tatolane kii zarurat he
 If the opposition is stubborn, then the government has also come on its stubbornness
 lagane laga he ki ek party ko bahumat dena bhi sansad ke sucharu rup se chalane ke liye kaaphi nahin

 loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle congress ne ek bada chunavi vaada kiya he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has said that if his party forms a government, the poor will be guaranteed minimum income
 unhone yah elaan chhattisgarh main kiya
 According to Congress sources, 1500 to 1800 rupees can be given directly to a bank account every month for every poor person
 yah bahut bada vaada he jisase congress kii chunavi tasviir badal sakati he
 Rahul Gandhi's grandmother Indira Gandhi made a similar promise
 unhone apane khilaaf lamabandi ke indira hataao naare ke badale garibi hataao kaa naaraa diya tha
 His son and Rahul's father Rajiv Gandhi also gave the slogan of Poverty Hatao
 ab rahul gandhi kah rahe hai ki congress kii sarkaar bani to koi bhi garib bhookha nahin soyega
 So what is the minimum income guarantee? 2016-17 ke aarthik surveykshan main vitt mantri arun jetali ne iskaa zikr kiya tha
 It is also called Universal Basic Income
 iske tahat ek tay seemaa se kam aamadani waalon ko har maheene sidhe bank khate main ek tayshuda rakam die jane kaa prastaav he
 But it was not clear whether it would be given with the existing subsidy or in its place
 dilachasp baat yah he ki tab aarthik surveykshan main is prastaav par gambhir charchaa kii jarurat bataai gai thi lekin pichley do saal main sarkaar main is par koi charchaa nahin hui
 Neither universal basic income was mentioned in any subsequent economic survey nor in the budget
 ab jabaki modi sarkaar apane maujuuda kaarykaal kaa antim bajet ek farvari ko pesh karne ja rahi he, use lekar kai tarah ke kayaas hai
 It is being said that there can be a fixed amount of loan to farmers at zero interest rate or fixed per acre per crop
 middle class ko iskar main chhot kii seemaa badhaane kii bhi atkal he or sookshm, laghu or manjhaule udyog ke liye koi package ghoshit hone kii bhi baat
 There was also a speculation that the Modi government would announce universal basic income for the poor
 par rahul gandhi ne usase pehle hi iskaa elaan kar ek bada daanv chal diya he
 That too at a time when the Modi government is patting its back on those reports which said that the number of poor in the country has reduced in the last five years
 jaahir he bijepi ko ab turant hi congress ke vaade kii kaat dhundhani hogi
 Expectations regarding the budget have been raised a lot
 bijepi ke kuch netaa kah chuke hai ki antarim bajet jaisi koi chiz nahin hoti or ek farvari ke bajet main sabake liye kuch na kuch jarur hoga
 On the other hand, the BJP is also saying that what happened to the Congress's election promises has been seen in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan where the Congress promised loan waiver to farmers but large scale irregularities have come to light in Madhya Pradesh
 kisi kisaan kaa 13 rupye kaa karj maaf hua to kisi kaa 100 rupye kaa
 The Congress's promise of guaranteeing minimum income will also be tightened on this criterion
 to sawaal he ki kya rahul gandhi ne bijepi ko clin bold kar diya he? kya bajet main bijepi congress ke is daanv kaa jawaab de paaegi?disclemur (asveekaran) : is aalekh main vyakt kiye gaye vichaar lekhak ke nijee vichaar hai

 The Tatra deal is just a glimpse of the brokerage in defense procurement, where there is a deep nexus between the ambitious agents of the Hathiyars, the corrupt officers and the leaders who can easily be beaten
 sarkari kaagajon main vaise to agast, 2006 se hi hathiyaaron ke agent gaayab ho chuke hai
 At that time, the defense companies had to sign a solemnity agreement where they were given an affidavit that they would not pay bribes and keep agents
 nirmaataaon ke liye praavdhaan tha ki yadi unhone agent kaa istemaal kiya, to unhen blaclist kar diya jayega
 In spite of all this, brokers are still flourishing, who are being given a 10 per cent commission as 'success money'

 It raised Rs 60,000 crore between 2007 and 2011

 In 2009, CBI arrested Sudipto Ghosh, former Chairman and Managing Director of Ordnance Factory Board
 aayudh factory board raksha mantralay ke tahat aane vaali 40 factoriyon par niyantran rakhane vaali sheersh ikai he
 Ghosh allegedly took bribes from two Indian and four foreign companies which were blacklisted by Antony on 5 March

 However, this ban did not stop the tremendous lobbying in India to grab a bigger share of the huge defense deals market
 sarkaar bhartiya vaayu sena ke liye kai arab dollar main 126 nai peedi ke ladaaku jet kharidne kaa sauda karne hi vaali thi ki uske ek pakhwaade pehle 31 janvari ko ek francisi hathiyaar kansaltent barnad baeko dilli pahunchaa

 khabar main bataaya gaya tha ki baeko jiii rafel yani ladaaku jet banane vaali 500 companiyon ke ek consorcium kii gathit team kaa hissaa tha
 According to Subramanian Swamy, the president of the Janata Party, which shook the country with its investigation into the 2G scam, Baeko's role was quite influential
 swami ne india today ko bataaya, ''vah dilli main kareeb ek hafte rahaa or kai ahm logon se mila

 In fact, what happened was that the Prime Minister's Office had received an official complaint from the South Korean government, pointing fingers at the companies' selection process
 daavedaaron main dakshin korea kii korean airospes industries (keei) bhi shaamil thi
 He was hit by Swiss airspace giant Pilatus Aircraft Ltd
 se thi
 It happened that Pilatus won the bid and the Korean company finished second, after which he accused the bidding process of malfunctions
 uskaa aarope tha ki swiss company ne jis keemat par boli lagaai thi usamen praudyogiki ke hastantaran or rakh-rakhaav kii laagat ko joda nahin gaya tha, jisase uski boli kam rahi
 Anant Venkatarami Reddy, an MP from Andhra Pradesh, wrote in a letter to the Prime Minister in December 2011, "because of this, we (indian Air Force) will have to pay a much higher cost of ownership of the aircraft
" ''reddy ne patr main likhaa, ''iske baavjood raksha mantralay ke adhikariyon ne tay kiya ki ve raksha kharid kii tamaam prakriyaaon ko nazarandaaj kar pilatus kaa paksh lenge
 The reason is that they know better
 mujhe itani jaankaree he ki raksha mantralay ko boli khulne se pehle hi pilatus kii ore se kai tarah ke takneekee or vittiya aankade praapt hue the taaki unki filein durust kii ja saken
 This is completely a violation of the declared functions of the Ministry of Defense

 In 2005, a chargesheet was filed against Vipin Khanna, a London-based middleman, and Delhi-based arms broker Mohinder Singh Sawhney, in connection with the commission to buy 1,200 anti-material rifles from the South African company Denal (see box: arms players)

 The deal was signed between Israel Aircraft Industries and the Indian Army
 nanda par hi slovakia se bakhtarband vaahanon ke aayaat main bhi kathith rishwatakhori kaa aarope tha
 The CBI investigation in this case has been stuck because the official approval from Israel and Britain for cooperation in judicial investigation (letter rogatory) has not been obtained

 Later, the CBI could not prove that the amount received from various corners of the world in Chaudhary's bank accounts was actually commission for brokerage

 However, the Enforcement Directorate will continue to conduct one such investigation at its level

 lekin ab to tatra ke rup main nai afat aa gai he
 The Modi government was successful in passing the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) Bill from both houses
 vidheyak paas hone par rashtriya swayan sevak sangh (aresas) khushi jaahir kii he
 With the passage of the bill, the Sangh and its allied organizations have begun to consider options to create an environment conducive to conversion, especially in the north-eastern states
 sangh ke padaadhikari anaupchaarik rup se kehete hai ki is vidheyak ke praavdhaan main yah saaf kaha gaya he ki bangladesh, pakistan or afghanistan se aane vaale aise sharnaarthi jo disambar 2014 tak aae hai unhe bharat kii naagarikta mil jaaegi
 But nowhere in the Bill is it said that the Muslims who came during this period, if they have changed or changed their religion (islam) during this or now, will get Indian citizenship or not
 vidheyak main is bare main kuch bhi nahin kaha gaya hesutron kaa kahana he ki sangh is bare main jald hi baithak kar yah suzav centre sarkaar ko bhejega ki jo log dharm parivartan kar lete hai unhe bhi bhartiya naagarikta di jaae
 An official from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad said in an informal conversation that the intruders (muslims) who came to India from these countries are outsiders in the eyes of the government
 yadi inamen bahut se log hindu dharm yaa isai dharm apana lete he or unhe waapas unke mul deshon main bhej diya jaataa he to phir vahaan vah alpsankhyak ke darje main aa jayega or phir vah vahaan prataditon kii shrenee main aa jayega
 If he then returns to India after being tortured from there, he will not be eligible for Indian citizenship as per the provisions of the Bill (since he will be considered to have come to India after 2014)
 aise main kya sarkaar unhe sharnaarthi maanegi yaa unhe naagarikta degi
 People associated with the affiliates of the RSS say that they will demand from the government that those within the ambit of CAB should also include those who leave Islam and adopt Hindu or Jain or Buddhism
 sangh sutro kaa kahana he ki vah siabi ke paas hone se khush hai lekin yah dekhnaa hoga ki isai ko itani taadaad main naagarikta nahin de jisase purvottar rajyon main dharmik asantulan bane
 Similarly, the number of Christians in the north-eastern states is already quite high
 sangh is baat ko lekar kai baar gambhir chintaa vyakt kar chukaa he
 The central leaders of the BJP informally believe that after the CAB is implemented, many people will consider converting across the country
 khaskar tab jab 2024 se pehle desh bhar main earsi lagu hona he
 In such a situation, people (muslims) who are currently living in different parts of the country as refugees will want to convert and stay in the country
 yahaan rajya sarkaron kii jimmedaari banati he ki vah is baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki sirf naagarikta paane ke liye jo log dharm parivartan kar rahe hai unki pahchaan karen

 In just three minutes or 180 seconds, the world's most vicious thieves group had stolen two billion and 70 crore diamonds
 ye heere switsraland ke raste hindustan ke surat shahar laae ja rahe the
 Now two and a half months later, when the police arrested 33 thieves in simultaneous raids in three countries, all were once again stunned
 duninga main hiron kii sabase badi chori ke choron ko padane ke liye puure 78 dinon tak duniya kii kai police force duniya bhar main khaak chaanati rahi
 But the thieves were also no less intelligent

 But even the police did not give up
 do arab 70 karod ke wo hero jo taraashne ke liye hindustan ke shahar surat laae ja rahe the, use choron se waapas hasil karne ke liye police ne zamin-aasmaan ek kar diya
 And the result of this hard work is that on 7 May, the police get a strong news

 Actually, these diamonds worth two billion and 70 crores were being brought to Surat city of India for carving and polishing

 Surely this is a theft that you cannot even think about

 paton ne kaha tha ki bilkul rasaatal main pahunchane ke baad aap palatakar kitna upar jate hai, vahi kamyaabi he
 a year ago, when Rahul Gandhi took charge of the Congress as the President, then his own and his party's fortunes had reached the abyss
 narendra modi-amit shah kaa kafila tufaani garjana ke saath aage bad rahaa tha or 29 main se 18 rajyon main bhartiya janata party kaa paracham laharaa rahaa tha
 On the other hand, the Congress did its worst in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, securing 44 seats, with successive governments being ousted from state assemblies
 inamen maharashtra, haryana, himachal pradesh, assam, uttarakhand, kerala, manipur or meghalaya shaamil the
 It also failed to prevent the BJP from registering its sixth consecutive victory in Gujarat
 punjab or karnataka akele do bade rajya the jahaan usne chunaav jite the or inamen bhi karnataka main vah chunaav baad gathbandhan ke jariye satta main aa saki thi
 But after a year, the Congress came back with full force and captured power in three very important states of the Hindi belt - Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 teen rajyon kii is jeet ne desh kii sabase puraani party main naatakeey dhang se nai jaan phoonk di he or use siyaasi takat main tabdeel kar diya he
 This victory has elevated Rahul's stature as Narendra Modi's topper in the 2019 general election
 is jeet ne modi-shah kii jodi se unka aparajeyata kaa aabhamandal chin liya he or bhaajapa ko gahare aatmamanthan ke liye majaboor kar diya he
 More importantly, this victory has put a question mark on Modi's re-election as Prime Minister
 ab yah utana pakkaa nahin rah gaya he jitna ek saal pehle maaloom detaa tha
 The 2019 playground has opened
 aakhirkaar rahul gandhi kaa aagaman ho chukaa he
 From a reluctant successor to the Congress leadership, he has matured into a leader who can handle the contradictions plaguing the party, bringing old leaders and young Turks together as a united team, as he did in the middle Done in the state and Rajasthan, can revitalize the Congress workers at the grassroots level, weave a trustworthy political bureaucracy for the voters, Opponents and especially he can give them the language and practices of Turshi automatically Turshi answers and maintain decency and decorum in the heat, even political battle all the same
 rahul ne dikhaa diya he ki shaleen raajnneeti koi virodhabhasi lafj nahin he
 He avoided being swept away in victory, when, after announcing the election results, he told the press, "I would like to thank the BJP chief ministers for the work they did in their last term
 ham unase kaman apane haath main lenge or shandaar kaam karenge
 Even at the press conference, Rahul made it clear that his way of working is different from Modi's style of work
 jab bhaajapa koi chunaav jitati he, to modi party mukhyalay main pahunch jate hai, jahaan dhoomdhaam se unka abhinandan kiya jaataa he or phir ve media ke sawaal liye bagaiyr party kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hai
 On the contrary, Rahul was ready to put his weak and delicate aspect in front of the people, when he said, "yesterday i was talking to my mother and telling her that the 2014 elections were the best opportunity for me
 maine kaaphi siikhaa ki chizon ke bare main kaise sochaa jaae
 i learned that the most important thing is humility
 or yah ki siyasatdan hone ke naate aapako dhyaan se sunanaa hota he ki desh ke log kya mahasoos kar rahe hai or usee bhaavana ke saath kaam karnaa hota he
 "then, in a decisive attack, he finally said," Frankly, it was Modi who taught me that lesson, because (to him) i understood what not to do
 mujhe unke bare main bura lag rahaa he, baavjood iske ki main vipaksh main hum, ki unhone desh kii dhadkan ko sunne se inkaar kar diya
 "it seems, Rahul has listened carefully to the suffering of the people, especially the widespread discontent among the farmers, and the rural crisis that has arisen in these states due to demonetisation and clear lack of jobs
" exis miindia-india today eczit pole ne in nateezon kii sateek bhavishyavaanee to kii hi thi, saath hi dikhaaya tha ki khaas taur par madhya pradesh main berozegaar, chaatr, khetihar mazdooron sahit kisaan or paaramparik kaarobaar main lage log badi taadaad main bhaajapa kaa saath chhodkar congress ke paale main aa gaye hai
 In Chhattisgarh, young voters were listening to Congress more carefully than BJP
 congress ke liye ahm baat yah he ki in rajyon ke essi / asti, muslim or obisi votaron kaa uske paale main lautnaa shuru ho gaya he
 This is not a bad performance for a person who was dismissed by the BJP as a mockery of politics
 vaise madhya pradesh or rajasthan kii jeet utani bharosa dilaane vaali nahin hai jitani ho sakati thim
 The vote share of BJP in Madhya Pradesh is almost as much as that of Congress - 40 of Congress
 9 fisadi ke mukaable 41 fisadi
 In Rajasthan, the Congress lost its zeal and circulation due to the ticket-sharing confusion and disunity and started to gasp before reaching the last destination
 39
 38 of Congress BJP with 3 per cent vote share
 8 fisadi vot hissedari se mahaj aadha fisadi ank hi aage he
 However, Chhattisgarh's victory was two-wicket
 rahul ne ajit jogi-mayawati ke gathbandhan kii dhauns-dapat ke aage jhukne se inkaar kar diya
 He preferred the strategy of Ekla Chalo and prepared four big leaders of Congress to work together as a team
 baaki do rajyon main alabatta congress khud apane aakarshan kii vajah se nahin, balki bhaajapa ke khilaaf nakaaratmak voton kii vajah se jiti, kyonki log badlaav chaahate the
 In Telangana and Mizoram, the Congress leaf became clear
 isliye in chunaavon main aisa bahut kuch he jisase congress or rahul donon apni kamyaabi kaa jashn manaate hue bhi sikh sakate hai
 Rahul knows that while the victory of these states has greatly boosted the Congress, the party is still far from readying to counter the bjp's strength and make it to dust in the 2019 elections
 mushkil se aadha darjan rajyon ko chhod den, to party kahin bhi us tarah badi khilaadi nahin he jaise vah pehle thi
 Even in the states where it is the main opposition, it is unorganized and unhappy
 masalan, haryana main rahul purv mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda ke virodh ke baavjood noujvaan netaa ashok tanvar ko aage badha rahe hai
 He resisted the removal of Tanwar from the position of the state Congress chief, even when Hooda's supporting legislators gave a written proposal for it
 rahul ko ab is kamjor karne vaale takaraav kaa santoshjanak samaadhaan nikaalnaa hoga
 There is a need to rejuvenate the state units by handing over the command to the young leaders in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh
 maharashtra sareekhe bade rajya main congress pichley do saal main 24 main se ek bhi nagar nigam main jeet darj nahin kar saki, mahaj ek nanded ko chhodkar, jo vaise bhi rajya adhyaksh ashok chavaan kaa grih nagar he
 If he is to win the state assembly elections in September 2019, then clearly there is a need to change the leadership here
 loksabhaa ke liye vah sharad pavaar kii rashtravaadi congress party (rakanpa) ke saath siton ke bantwaare par chaturaai se sahamat ho gai, jisamen use 48 main se 40 loksabhaa siten milengi
 In Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh — where there are 65 Lok Sabha seats in total — the party's performance is likely to improve after the assembly elections
 magar gujarat, assam, kerala, karnataka, punjab, haryana, uttarakhand or himachal pradesh main—jahaan kul 120 loksabhaa siten hai, rahul ko party main nai urja foonkane kii darkaar he
 The problem with the Congress is that in other big states, it has remained as the number three or even below player
 pashchim bengal main, jo 42 saansad loksabhaa main bhejtaa he, mukhyamantri mamata banerjee or unki ol india trinmul congress kaa ab bhi acha-khaasaa asar he
 The BJP has emerged as their main challenger, pushing both the CPI (M) and the Congress back
 odisha (21 siten) main biju janata dal (bijd) ke mukhyamantri naveen patnayak kaa dabadabaa kaayam he or yahaan bhi congress ko tisare sthaan par dhakelkar bhaajapa mukhya chalanger banakar ubhar rahi he
 In Uttar Pradesh, which sends the maximum number of mps to the Lok Sabha, the Congress remains a player of the margins
 maujuuda loksabhaa main rajya se uske paas mahaj do siten hai or uttar pradesh vidhansabha kii 404 siton main mahaj saat uske paas hai
 This victory of the states of the Hindi belt, which has given a fillip to the party's state unit, will have to find a way for a satisfactory seat-sharing of seats with both the main opposition parties - Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)
 
 taaja vidhansabha chunaavon main congress in donon partiyon ke saath gathbandhan karne main naakaam rahi or bhaajapa ko chunauti dene ke liye vah jis vipakshi gathbandhan kaa taana-bana bun paati he, usamen in donon partiyon ko laane ke liye use kadi mashkkat or molbhav karnaa padegaa
 In Bihar, where the Lok Sabha has 40 seats, the Congress is helpless by the organization's weaknesses, while its alliance partner Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is struggling to strengthen its support base and its charismatic leader Lalu Prasad Yadav fodder Prisons are being sentenced in scam cases
 unke bete tejasvi kii maatahati main rajd ne is saal march or may main kramshah ek loksabhaa seat or do vidhansabha siten jitkar nai takat se uth khadey hone kaa sanket diya he
 But the BJP has already moved ahead in the game by way of seat-sharing with the Janata dal-united (JDU) led by its alliance partner Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 rahul ko acchhee tarah pataa he ki agar unhen 2019 main modi or bhaajapa ko dharashayi karnaa he, to congress akele chunaav main nahin utar sakati or use vipaksh ke mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa bananaa hi hoga
 Realizing this imperative, he has changed his leadership style and is also ready to make extra efforts to reach out to potential allies for 2019
 rahul siyaasi mashvire ke liye aksar dilli main sharad pavaar ke ghar chale jate hai
 CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury has emerged as Rahul's second political advisor
 dakshin main dramuk ke stallin kii shakl main unke paas ek tikaoo samarthak he
 The biggest success for Rahul in recent times is his friendship with TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu, who has emerged as an axis of opposition unity
 congress ke kai sheersh netaaon ne rahul ko telugana main tidipi ke saath gathbandhan karne ke khilaaf salaah di thi, kyonki isse rajya main party ko nuksaan pahunchane kii sambhaavna thi
 But the Congress President decided to sacrifice half-baked chances in Telangana for better bargaining for the Lok Sabha elections
 isliye, tiares ne congress-tidipi gathbandhan ko bhale hi dhul chataa di ho, par rahul ke paas phir bhi muskaraane kii vajah he
 On 10 December, Naidu himself took the initiative and mobilized leaders of 21 opposition parties to meet in Delhi
 mamata banerjee or arvind kejariwal sareekhe netaa bhi baithak main shaamil hue, jo pehle congress kii bulaai aisi baithkon se dur rahe the
 Mamta Banerjee tweeted: "the semi-final has proved that the BJP is nowhere in these states
 yah 2019 ke final match kaa asli loktantric sanket he
 After all, people are the "man of the match" in a democracy
 vijetaon ko meri badhai
 The SP and the BSP too did not delay in giving unconditional support to the Congress in Madhya Pradesh, even though the party had rejected their offers before the election
 rahul ke liye ab chunauti yah he ki ve is ekta ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav tak aage le jaaen or uttar pradesh, bihar, maharashtra, tamilnadu, pashchim bengal or odisha main ranneetik gathbandhan kaayam karen, jahaan kul milakar 270 loksabhaa siten hai
 The prospects look bleak in Telangana (17 seats) in the south, but in Karnataka (28 seats), where it has an alliance with JD (S), the Congress is hoping to do better
 tamilnadu (39 siten) main usne dramuk ke saath haath milaayaa he, andhra pradesh (25 siten) main sattarudh tidipi ke saath siton kaa bantwaaraa kiya he or puduccheri kii iklauti loksabhaa seat ke alaava kerala (20 siten) main united democratic front ke hisse ke taur par gathbandhan ke achche taur-tareeke apanaae hai
 In this way, the total number of Lok Sabha seats in the south reaches 130
 muddon se nipatane ke modi sarkaar ke taur-tareekon main mahaj galtiyaan dhundne ke bajaae rahul ko ek vaikalpik vijan saamne rakhana hoga
 In the press conference after the election results, he outlined the major issues facing the country and said that the main issues today are providing employment to the youth, improving the future of the farmers in the country and curbing corruption
 ab jab congress bade rajyon main satta main laut ai he, use krishi ke sankat kaa hal nikaalane ke tareeke khojane honge or, jaisaa ki khud rahul ne mana he, karj maafee ke jariye nahin, jo iskaa asthaayee samaadhaan he
 The challenge will be to develop reasonable structural reforms and that too in a very short time, because the Indian voter is now very impatient and impatient
 rahul ne eemaandaaree se yah sweekaar kiya ki "maujuuda hukumat par hamale karne ke bajaae ham dhaanche kaayam karenge or ek nae vijan khadaa karenge jo hamaare desh ko aage le ja sake
 Party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said that for the past several months, efforts were on to negotiate with a large number of different sections to develop a vision for the party
 rahul is baat ko lekar bhi sachet hai ki modi-shah kii jodi ko kamatar aankna badi galati hogi
 Modi's popularity in private despite being outperformed in Hindi states, as revealed by the Axis My India and India Today surveys, remains high not just in these states, but nationwide
 pichley saadhe chaar varshon main modi ne khud ko garibon ke maseehaa ke rup main pesh kiya he or mahilaon tathaa yuvaaon ke liye vibhinn yojanaon ke alaava jaruratmandon ko laabh pahunchane vaale vikaas ke kai kaarykram shuru kiye hai
 Although the public has decided on the implementation of these programs, the image of the Prime Minister remains that of a serious, hardworking and honest leader
 rahul kii ore se rafel saude ko ek bada ghotaalaa bataane kii koshish abhi zyada kaamyaab hoti nahin dikh rahi he
 Along with the RSS, the BJP also has Ayodhya cards
 uske ek netaa ke mutabik, party kii yojana keval vikaas ke aadhaar par apana prabhaav badhanaa nahin he balki mandir mudde ke jariye bhaajapa ke pakke votaron kii bhaawanaaon ko bhi uthaanaa he
 Although Rahul has shown last year that he has a cut, a big win in three states is proof of this
 congress adhyaksh ko agle chah maheene ke liye apni yojana taiyaar kerani he or iske liye samay bahut kam bachaa he
 If the mission to defeat Modi and BJP in 2019 is to be successful, they will have to move forward with speed, clarity, perseverance and vision
 is prayaas main ve shaayad jaik velch kii salaah le sakate haih "netaa banane se pehle safalataa kaa matlab khud ko taqatvar bananaa hota he
 When you become a leader, success means making others stronger
 ''2019 ke loksabhaa ke lierahul kaa agenda-aisa vijan taiyaar karne kii jarurat he ki ve matadaataaon ke saamne kya vikalp muhaiyaa kara sakate hai, unka chunaav prachaar mukhya rup se kathith rafel ghotaale, kisaanon kii samasya, berogari, notebandi or jiesti se pareshaani ke irdagird ghumta rahaa he
 But he has not offered any long-term alternative framework
 -uttar pradesh, bihar, pashchim bengal, odisha, andhra pradesh, telugana or tamilnadu main party kaa koi khaas janaadhar nahin he
 These states have 264 Lok Sabha seats
 modi ko hataane ke liye party ko in rajyon main majboot kshetreey partiyon se bharosemand gathbandhan bananaa hoga-haryana, himachal pradesh, uttarakhand, maharashtra or gujarat jaise jin rajyon main congress mukhya vipakshi party he, vahaan rahul ko nayaa or tejatarraar netritv khadaa karnaa hoga
 In the south, Rahul will have to compromise on seat sharing with Chandrababu Naidu's TDP in Andhra Pradesh, Stalin's DMK in Tamil Nadu and Deve Gowda's JD (S) in Karnataka
 -narendra modi or rahul gandhi ke bich sidhe mukaable main pradhanmantri kii sweekaaryata kahin adhik he, jaisaa ki tamaam surveykshanon se pataa chalata he
 In comparison to the BJP in terms of money power, the Congress does not stay anywhere

 master blaster sachin tendulkar ne 2007 cricket vishwa cap cap main haar ko apane peshewar karier kaa sabase kharaab lamhaa qaraar diya or iske liye ballebaaji kram main chook ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 What was not right was the batting line-up also failed to make it to the Super Eight stage of this high-profile tournament held in the West Indies and was eliminated from the first round after losing to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka
 tendulkar ne greg chapel ke bare main kuch nahin kaha or jor diya ki vah dressing room kii baton kaa khulaasa nahin karenge lekin unhen is bare main koi andeh nahin ki ballebaaji kram ‘parfect’ nahin tha
 Tendulkar batted at number four in this competition while Robin Uthappa was sent over him
 unhone kaha, ‘‘mujhe lagata he ki hamaara ballebaaji kram sahi nahin tha
 "master Blaster said," It was a big tournament and we had a great team
 sab kuch thik lag rahaa tha lekin mujhe lagata he ki hamaara ballebaaji kram sahi nahin tha

 He said, "of course it is painful for the team to lose but losing in the 2007 World Cup was more disappointing

 deshbhar main yuva vailemtine de manaane ke liye tarah tarah kii yojana bana rahe hai lekin jammu kashmir main yuva aisa nahin kar sakate
 The reason for this is that the dukhtaran-e-millat in Kashmir and the Sri Ram Army have taken a front in Jammu
 14 farvari ko bharat hi nahin duniyabar main yuva prem ke din ke taur manaate hai lekin agar jammu kashmir main yuvak yuvatiyaan ise manaate hai to jaraa sanbhal kar
 The police is also ready to say, but often they come only after the incident
 police ke mutabik agar yuvaaon kii bhaawanaaon ko jor jabardastee se dabaane ke prayaas hue to karrwai hogi
 The situation here is that in Kashmir, dukhtaran-e-millat has given a clear threat, while in Jammu, the Sri Ram army has formed a group of guerrillas who will catch such couples who will be celebrating Valentine's Day
 dukhtaraan-e-millat kii pramukh aaysha andrabi kaa kahana he ki vailemtine de pashchimi sabhyataa kii dein he jo islam main maanya nahin he
 Obviously, the threat to young men and women alone is not only in Kashmir but also in Jammu
 shriram sena ne bhi chetavanee di he ki wo kisi bhi jode ko aisa nahin karne denge
 The Shriram Sena had last distributed a leaflet warning everyone that they would be responsible for the consequences of celebrating Valentine's Day
 tippaniyan If Shriram Sena believes, the protest of Valentine's Day will not be limited to Jammu city only this time, but also in small towns
 vahiin dukhtaraan-e-millat is din ko manaane kii koshish karne waalon ko cabin culture ke khilaaf kuch samay pehle chhedi gai apni muhim kii yaad dilaanaa chaahati he
 She is clearly threatening that what happened to the couples caught during the campaign to end the cabin culture may be worse than those who celebrate Valentine's Day
 dhyaan rahe ki cabin culture ke khilaaf chalaai gai muhim main aatanki gut ne kaiyon ko jinda jalaane kii koshish kii thi
 To make his point known, dukhtaran-e-millat has announced a strict ban on Valentine's Day in the valley, placing posters outside educational institutions and mosques in down town, warning young couples to avoid showing love

 What is the secret of your success, after the 2014 Lok Sabha results, people felt that such a result cannot be repeated? We work on a mission
 ham sabko bharosa tha ki aise hi nattejey aaenge
 i had also said earlier that two-thirds will be surpassed
 chunaav jeetne ke bahut se kaaran hote hai, lekin mukhya kaaran pradhanmantri narendra modi kii lokapriyata or garibon ko lakshith yojanaon kaa sahi tareeke se jameen par pahunchnaa
 Along with this, crores of our workers kept working among the people and eventually won
 kai samvidhan export kehete hai ki pehle jo single larguest party he use sarkaar banane kaa mauka dena chahie tha?koun se export kehete hai, mainen to nahin dekha
 According to the tradition so far, the first person who goes to the Governor with a magic figure of support is given the chance? Let me make it clear to the people of the country that even after us, the Congress did not raise a majority and put a claim before the Governor
 kyon hua aisa, do-teen siten hi chahie thi unako bahumat tak pahunchane ke liye?ye aap mujhase kyon puch rahe hai, congress se hi puuchhie
 If you are the Chief Strategist of Modi, i advise him that if i change your job for a minute and say that you have to advise Rahul Gandhi, what will you give? i will never take this job
 aap to master stritigist hai aapako kisi ko bhi jitaana aana chahie
 
 
 i am not a professional
 main bachapan se party ke siddhanton ke saath judaa hum, man se siddhanton ko samarpit kaaryakarta hum
 Whatever my role, i am a resident of the Bharatiya Janata Party and will live and die with principles
 profeshnal varsej party se judaa ek sawaal he, jab bihar main aapaki badi haar hui to logon ne sawaal kiya ki kya upi main amit shah ne jo kiya vah tukka tha, kya iske liye prashanth kishor jimmedaar the
 You recently tweeted that this mandate proved who the real Chanakya is
 kya aapke or prashanth bhushan ke bich kisi tarah kii pratispardhaa kii bhaavana thi?meri kisi se spardhaa nahin, meraa kaam meri party kaa vikaas karnaa he
 i am the president of the party
 hamaare paas bahut se masale hai logo ke paas le jane ke liye
 Whenever the BJP was asked why the Ganga was not cleared, why the roads were not built, every time it was said that the state government was not giving NOC, it was not allowing land acquisition
 aapane kaha ki state main sarkaar nahin he
 Now you realize that you have no excuse left? You also have a government in the state, you also have a government in the center
 jo itani ummid aapane dikhaai hai logon ko use puraa karnaa hi hoga
 
 
 We are not coming to power for the first time
 ham gujarat main, rajasthan main, chhattisgarh, madhya pradesh main satta main aae hai
 In the eighties, a phrase was popularized - that of sicku
 jo pichde rajya hai unke liye bimaaru shabd ijad kiya gaya tha, bihar, madhya pradesh, rajasthan, upi ke liye
 We have Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, which have come out of the tag of sicku
 bihar main jab tak hamaari sarkaar thi, hamane use lagbhag baahar nikaalane kaa prayaas kiya tha
 Today, the people of UP have given us UP
 ham aglaa janadesh jab lene jaaenge to upi bimaaru rajya nahin hoga
 You are saying that in the next five years, the fate of UP will change
 aap thodaa thos bataaie ki vastav main kya karenge, aaj ke or agle paanch saal ke upi main kya fark hoga?sabase pehali baat to koi bhedbhaavpurn shashan hamaara nahin hoga
 Secondly, the caste-ridden administration will be run in accordance with the beliefs of the Constitution
 hamane kai jagah par deveopment karke dikhaaya he
 24 hours electricity, road to villages, primary education
 swasthya sevaaon ko bhi sudhara he
 All possibilities are present inside UP
 bharpoor sansaadhan he, mehanatakash or talented yuva he
 After a good government, UP will soon be on the map of the developed states of the country
 aap kah rahe hai ki kisi kaa tushtikaran nahin hoga sabko saath lekar chalenge
 One of your own elected mlas, Brijesh Singh, says that the name of Deoband should be changed to Devvriand, similar work will be there for development? Their intention is not to run BJP
 agar itani hi mehnat se aap congress ke logon kaa abhipraay dhundhen to ek puri documentry ban jaaengi
 He would have said, but this would have nothing to do with the government's performance
 matlab aapkaa kahana he ki sarkaar chalati rahegi kuch naam badalane pade to koi baat nahin
 There was so much discussion, regarding the multiple demonetisation, do you think that there was no loss of demonetisation in UP? Demonetization was not done for any electoral gains or losses
 desh kii janata notebandi ke saath he
 The mandate of the five states is clearly stating that the people have appreciated this step of the Prime Minister
 isliye kyonki media or vipaksh ne bhi ise ishyu banaaya tha, hamane bhi apana paksh janata ke saamne rakhaa tha
 You were a successful stock broker in politics, you were more successful in it or more successful in politics? i had earned money right brother
 agar is samay aapako logon ko salaah deni ho, aapako stock chunanaa ho, koun se stock ko pick karnaa chahenge, aapke hisaab se imarging story kya he??stock khareednaa aisi aasaan baat nahin hoti
 For this complete tracking has to be done, balance seat analysis has to be done
 desh kii iconomi main badlaav ko samajhnaa padataa he
 Data analysis of the emerging sector has to be done, people running the company also have to see the details
 tab jaakar bazaar main utarate hai
 i no longer track it nor do i have this job
 aap shaayad 20 se 25 fisadi salanaa ritern de rahe the apane funds par
 
 
 Rahul ji, this is not today's topic
 aap personal jaankaree nahin dete
 Hundred percent of people are dependent on politics
 aapane upi jeet ke baad kuch party enjoy kiya yaa aage kinartak gujarata, himachal par hi focus karne lage hai?gujarat, himachal kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Do you feel that bjp's aim is to create Congress-free India, will India Congress be free in terms of political dominance in the next few years? As far as political dominance is concerned, we still have governance in 58 percent of the country, Including the comrades, 65 per cent is ruled
 centre sarkaar main hamaara purna bahumat he
 By Congress-free India, we mean to free the Congress from the culture of casteism, familism and appeasement, Congress has come under the rule of the country and we will free the country from it
 kya aap maanate hai ki jab tak rahul gandhi hai tab tak modi or amit shah ko chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin?ham pratispardhi kii kamajori par nahin apni mehnat or hamaari party main jo janata kii sweekruti he us par nirbhar karte hai
 Do you think that the model of Bihar, after this big victory, will become the standard for the opposition, they will have to meet, just like they met in Bihar, by 2019, all your opponents will be in the battleground against you
 ? They even met in UP
 lekin upi main mayawati nahin thim, bant gaya tha trikoniya sangharsh ho gaya tha
 
 
 Yes, but there were two big parties, not even a small alliance
 jab peeche dekhte hai to kabhi aap sochate hai ki bihar main kahaan phisal gaye, kya sabak liya aapane bihar se?main peeche mudakar nahin dekhtaa, aage dekhtaa hu
 Gujarat, Himachal, Odisha, Karnataka elections are in front, BJP will do well in these four states
 aapako chunaav ladvane kaa shauk he, aap ise lekar utsahit ho jate hai, kya yah aapkaa junun he?ham to sudhaar laana chaahate hai
 The Prime Minister has kept a thought that in front of the country, elections to Parliament, Legislatures and Panchayats should be held all over the country on a single day and later this system should be in place for five years
 baar-baar chunaav se janata or desh ko mukt kar diya jaae
 If this happens, journalists will get upset, the news sources that we get continuously will dry up, the news will get less
 kuch log kahenge ki yah aapako is vakt politicali suut kar rahaa he, modi ji kii hawa he aap jeet jaaenge, shaayad isliye aisi baat kar rahe hai?itnaa bada sanvaidhanik sudhaar kisi ek raajnneetik dal ke phaayde ke liye nahin hoga
 It is in the good of the country
 desh ko puraani vyavastha se baahar nikalnaa chahie
 According to you, how much could you implement in 2014, Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, which was Modi's agenda? When we went before the people in 2014, there was an atmosphere of severe disappointment within the country
 har maheene ghapala ghotaalaa saamne aa rahaa tha
 Young was disappointed, women were not safe
 hamane ek nirnaayak, paardarshee sarkaar di he
 Despite being three years, not a single scam has come to light
 sargical strike ne is desh kii simaaon ko surakshit kar puri duniya ko sandesh diya he duniya main bharat kaa sammaan badha he
 India is a strong country today
 garibon ke jivan str main sudhaar hua he
 Worked to deliver toilets to the homes of more than four crore poor
 do karod se zyada garibon ke ghar main gas kaa silinder pahunchane kaa kaam kiya he
 They have worked to raise their standard of living
 gramin or shahari vikaas ke liye kaam kiya he
 Have joined the world's fastest growing economies
 ye jo sarkaar he vah gramin yaa shahari vikaas ke dwandv main nahin padi
 We ensured that the two developed together
 aaj duniya ke saamne narendra modi ek majboot netaa ke rup main ubhare hai
 This era is the most accurate and resultant government after independence
 kya aapako lagata he ki is bade mandet ke baad riform proces usko bal milegaa?ham riform main nahin transformation main bharosa karte hai
 We are doing many things without fear
 aglaa bada transformation kya hoga?bahut kaam chal rahaa he, lekin media positive chijen dikhaata nahin
 We have made such a big change that political parties cannot take more than 2 thousand donations in cash, but the media did not keep it the way it should have been exposed
 aapane shaayad india today kii special investigation team kii report nahin dekhi he, jisamen sting oparation main dikhaaya gaya he ki log ab 2 hajaar se kam ke farji bill bana rahe hai
 Extra billing is taking place
 netaa har paisa digital le aisa kyon nahin kiya aapane?jab 20 hajaar se 2 hajaar rupee par le aae to aap kah rahe hai ki jiro kyon nahin hua
 Change happens slowly
 sabhi raajnneetik dalon se baatcheet kar is disha main bhi aage badhanaa chahenge
 You should know how difficult it is to make a bill of 20 thousand and how much to make a bill of 2 thousand
 kya aapako lagata he ki bijepi desh kii raajnneeti kii nai dhuree ban chuki he, jo pehle congress kii pojishan hua karti thi, ab desh kii raajnneeti bijepi ke ird-gird gum rahi he?bijepi yah sthiti 2014 main hi hasil kar chuki he, pole ban chuki he
 Nowadays you are very confident, talk of New India, 2022 in the development goal
 kya aapako lagata he ki 2019 kaa chunaav aapaki jeb main he?sarkarein lagaataar chalane vaali prakriya hoti hai
 If we make any improvement, it goes on continuously
 jahaan tak 2019 kaa sawaal he to nishchit rup se main maanata hum ki purna bahumat ke saath bijepi sarkaar aegi
 You must have seen that ever since the results of up-uttarakhand have come, the opposition has been alleging that there is something wrong with the evms
 hamaare sho main bispi kii ek netaa ain or unhone kaha ki 56 inch kaa seenaa he to is baar chunaav ballat paper se karke dikhaa den, doodh kaa doodh pani kaa pani ho jayega
 What answer would you like to give to him? The absolute majority that Mayawati had got in UP was also met by EVM
 doosraa, iviem kaa niyantran dm ke haath main hota he, centre sarkaar ke haath main nahin
 Arvind Kejriwal told the press conference that he had 700 of our volunteers in one seat, in some booth, but only 4 votes were received there
 
 
 wo to unako walantier ko poochna chahie
 Tell Kejriwal ji that if we had done a scam, why would have won the Congress, the bjp-akali would have won
 unhone punjab main kaha ki jo aap ko vot padana tha wo akali ko chalaa gaya
 
 
 Nobody listens to Kejriwal except you
 agar kejariwal punjab main jitate to aapke liye zyada samasya hoti
 Did you have an agenda that Congress may win, Kejriwal should not win? i think the public has recognized the kind of political level that people are going to decline
 mumbai main aapaki ajeebogareeb alliance he, aap log ladate-jhagadate rahete hai
 How long will this bed marriage continue, when will there be divers, will it continue to fight like this? We could not reach any common point in Maharashtra, so we had a friendly fight
 lekin hamaara gathbandhan ab bhi he
 Our alliance is still and will continue to be
 aaj do-teen dfa vaajapeyi ji kii charchaa hui, to kya gathbandhan sahyogiyon ko khush rakhane kii bhaavana ab us daur ke jaisaa nahin he?vaajapeyi ji hote to aaj vah bhi vahi karte jo bhartiya janata party kar rahi he
 Do you think Vajpayee and Modi are going in the same direction? The party is going in one direction
 party kis disha main ja rahi he, haal main vaajapeyi ji kaa bayaan viral hua tha ki kashmir se lekar kanyakumari tak har jagah camel khilanaa chahie; aapke hisaab se kya 2019 se pehle hi aap us lakshya tak pahunch jaaenge?ham pahunch chuke hai
 Right now you are not in Tamil Nadu, not in Kerala? Leh is the Ladakh seat at the top, there is the Bharatiya Janata Party, at the bottom is Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu where the Bharatiya Janata Party has also won
 pashchim main kuccha or purab main assam bhi ham jeet chuke hai
 Why do you give tickets to so many defectors, all the leaders speak to us that Amit ji should not do this, do not give to party members, give tickets to outsiders
 
 
 defections do tarah ke hote hai
 The first is defection after one election and six months before the second election, someone wants to accept the principles of our party, later goes for public mandate, then it cannot be called defection so easily
 baaki sab log modi ji se darake baat karte hai, kya aap bhi aise baat karte hai yaa unke munh par hi kuch khilaaf bol dete hai?main modi ji ke saath apane rishte kii vyakhya kar detaa hum
 The ideal equation that should be between the Prime Minister of the country and the National President of the party is between us

 Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh today alleged that Gandhian Anna Hazare, who openly opposed the Congress in the Hisar by-election, has, therefore, observed a 'silent fast' so that he was appointed as the former Chief Minister of Karnataka b
 es
 Yeddyurappa and his team member Prashant Bhushan had nothing to say about the episode
 cheharaa pahachaanen, jeeten inam
 To participate Kliksingh said that it seems that Hazare has taken a silent vow to avoid answering questions about Yeddyurappa or Prashant Bhushan
 anna ke andolan par vishesh kaverejunhone hajaare par dohare maapdand apnaane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki main aashcharyachakit hum ki hajaare yah kyon nahin sweekaar karte ki unhen rashtriya swayan sevak sangh kaa samarthan praapt he or uske kaaryakartaaon ne hajaare ke bhrashtachar rodhi abhiyaan ke dauraan tamaam intjaam kiye the
 Know what is Jan Lokpal? Singh said that a Sangh official had issued written instructions to his workers to support Hazare's campaign
 aise hi nirdesh baba ramdev ke andolan ke liye bhi jari kiye gaye the
 He said that on one hand Hazare claims not to have a single Sangh worker present during his fast
 vahiin sangh ke puraane kaaryakarta govindacharya kah rahe hai ki anshan sthal par maujuud 20 pratishat kaaryakarta sangh ke the
 Both these statements cannot be true simultaneously

 Also why did not it say that Govindacharya's claim is wrong
 unhone kaha ki jab hajaare ne apana anshan samaapt kiya tha to unhone pradhanmantri or nyaaypalika ko jan lokapal ke daayre main laane kaa mudda chhod diya tha
 After that, what decision did the government take, which Hazare announced to oppose the Congress in the Hisar by-election
 singh ne aarope lagaaya ki kuch raajnneetik vyakti hajaare ko siyasat main dhakelnaa chaahate hai
 See Anna on hunger strike, leader of the party, he said that i wrote a letter to Hazare in a completely non-political capacity, to which he gave a political reply in eight pages
 isse jaahir hota he ki vah raajnneetik logon se ghir chuke hai
 Singh said whether it is possible that one person can democratically carry out the proceedings ranging from writing a complaint of corruption to prosecution
 aisa puri duniya main kahin nahin ho saktaa
 This aspect should be brought before the common people
 unhone kaha ki lokapal kaa maamla sansad kii sthaayee samiti ke paas he or sarkaar ek majboot lokapal chaahati he

 In Syria too, this kind of protest is proving meaningless because there too people are facing the ruthless action of President Assad
 aaj bazaar kaa arthshaastra bhi gandhivadi arthshaastra ke swadeshivaad ko jhuthla chukaa he
 In today's era of realistic corrupt politics based on opportunism rather than morality, morality seems ridiculous
 iske baavjood jab maine duniya ke kuch bade gandhivadi vidwaanon main shumaar ek mahila ko dilli main bhaashan dete suna or unka intervyuu liya to mujhe aaj ke daur main gandhi kii praasangikta kaa ehsaas hua
 Be it the protest against dictatorial rulers in Arab countries, the movement against corruption in India, the challenge to the legitimacy of governments in this country, the disdain for politics in the Indian elite, or the role of morality in the economy To be a matter of vyaakhyaan dene vaali mahila thim judith brown, jo abhi haal tak oxford uniwarsity main kaamanwealth history kii professor rahi thim

 Brown said of Nanda's biography on Gandhi that it exemplified the tradition of serious research on Gandhi's life and his works
 judith brown apane vishay main praveen hai
 He told me, "I have lived Gandhi very closely
 ’’ ek profeshnal itihaaskaar ke taur par ve mahatma gandhi kii jeevani likh chuki hai or baad main unhone nehru kii bhi jeevani likhi
 In that too, she returns to Gandhi
 ve gandhi se kaaphi sahanubhuti rakhti hai
 He was born near Meerut in Uttar Pradesh
 unke pita vahaan angrej padariyon ke ek dharmik skool ke principal the
 He is now also an English clergyman
 brown naitiktapurna raajnneeti kii pakshdhar hai
 He told the audience, "the Gandhian tradition of moralist politics has become an essential part of political activity
 ’’ unhone apana vyaakhyaan yah kehete hue khatm kiya ki ‘‘gandhi duniya main prerana kii murti ban chuke hai
 "brown called Nanda the historian of historians, while the same noun can be given to him as well
" unhone mujhase kaha, ‘‘main vyaakhyaan ke ant main nots muhaiyaa karaane se roak nahin saki
 "his lecture was very balanced, in which there was no hollow praise of Gandhi from anywhere
" unhone yah kahkar do shrotaaon ko naaraaz kar diya ki ‘‘british shashan ko hataane main savinay avagya kii koi bhoomika nahin thi
 He also said that "the non-violent movement had a limited role in the struggle for India's independence
" ’’apane is drushtikon ko sahi sabit karte hue brown ne kaha ki aazaadee kaa andolan un dinon duniya main ghatit ho rahi ghatnaon or bharat main ho rahi halchal se prabhavit tha
 He said that the United States had demanded that Britain should guarantee India's independence as the price of aid given in World War II
 unhone mujhe bataaya ki yuddh ke baad british pradhanmantri klement atali ne mahasoos kiya ki britain ab bharat ko apane kabje main zyada din tak nahin rakh saktaa or unhone spasht shabdon main likhaa ki angreji shashan ko banaae rakhane ke uddeshy se british sena ko agar bharat main ladgaye ke liye waapas jane ko kaha gaya to vah baghawat kar degi
 The question of legitimacy, but Brown believed that Gandhi had a major role in the independence movement
 unhone bataaya ki gandhi kii uplabdhiyon main se ek badi uplabdhi yah thi ki unhone british raaj kii vaidhata ko chunauti di
 This was important
 professor brown ne kaha, ‘‘yah sochna galat he ki britain ne takat ke boote bharat par shashan kiya
 "he said," Britain depended on its Indian allies, some allies were working directly for the government and some were those who were associated with the judicial system
 iske alaava bharat ke rajavaadon kaa bhi sahyog tha
 To illustrate the importance of these collaborators, Brown presented figures that not only surprised me, but also surprised the publisher of one of his books
 prakaashak ko jaise un par vishwaas hi nahin hua or usne kaha ki ve dobaaraa un aankadon ko jaanch-samaj len
 These figures were taken from the 1921 census
 is janaganana se pataa chalata tha ki british bharat main europea logon kii aabaadi maatr 1,57,000 thi or inamen se lagbhag ek-tihaai mahilaayein thim
 Total population of India under British rule 24
 7 karod thi
 Brown told me, "that's why Gandhi felt that if he questioned the legitimacy of British rule, the legitimacy of his Indian allies would also come under the question and thus the British rule would be completely weakened
" ’’jab maine unase poocha ki arab main andolan ke dauraan kahiraa ke taharir chowk par jo bheed juty thi, kya usamen gandhi kii praasangikta dikhaai di thi, to brown kaa jawaab tha, ‘‘main samajhati hum ki hamaare anumaan se kahin zyada log gandhi kaa naam sun chuke the or jane yaa anjaane unke naam par jute rahe the
 "the question of legitimacy in India is relevant even today
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf chalane vaala andolan ek prakaar se sarkaar kii vaidhata ko sidhi chunauti he
 The manner in which the public supported the movement last year is a warning to all leaders
 bharat ke liye khatre kii baat yah he ki us andolan ke kamjor padane or andolan ke netritv main phu t padane se desh ke rajaneta yah sochane lagenge ki unhen apni vaidhata ko lekar kisi tarah kii chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Judith Brown's analysis on Gandhi's Civil Disobedience Movement provides some practical clues for leaders of the anti-corruption movement
 unhone kaha ki is tarah ke andolanon ke liye koi nishchit blue print nahin hota, unhen vishesh paristhitiyon ke anuroop taiyaar karnaa padataa he
 He points out that Gandhi used to target his opponent's weakest vein, as he targeted the legitimacy of the British Raj, which was his weakest vein
 ve us jagah par kabhi waar nahin karte the, jo zyada majboot hoti thi
 That is, they avoided targeting such a point, which would justify the government's use of force against the movement
 indira gandhi ne immergency ko yah kahkar kuch had tak sahi tehraane kii koshish kii thi ki unke virdohi centre sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ko pangu bananaa chaahate the
 The crime of those who are neutral will write even when i asked Brown that if Gandhi were today, what would he think about the corruption prevailing in India, which has become such a big issue, then his answer was, "they are the basic of corruption in public life
" Showing moral fear and saying, a big problem is that India has not changed much since 1947
 ’’ yahaan ek baar phir gandhi aaj ke bharat main sidhe praasangik ho jate hai
 According to Professor Brown, Gandhi had told Congress politicians elected in provincial assemblies in 1937, "you guys drive in motorways
" tum log aupniveshik or samrajyavaadee taur-tareeke apanaate ho, isliye main samajhataa hum ki kuch khaas nahin badla he
 "brown also spoke on the subject of failing to bring change in free India
" aisa badlaav jisamen ‘‘puri tarah se prashasnic sudhaar kiye gaye hon or jinke aadhaar par jameen par koi bada parivartan dikhaai detaa
 "but it is not right to dismiss all politicians as corrupt, because even today there are many honest mps and mlas in the country
" isi tarah sabhi prashasnic adhikariyon ko babu kah dena bhi thik nahin he
 On the contrary, it is very easy to free yourself from all responsibilities by calling politics a dirty game
 brown ne apane vyaakhyaan main kaha, ‘‘maanav jivan ke swabhaav kii naitik samaj rakhane vaala koi bhi vyakti gandhi ke vichaaron or unke aacharan se prabhavit hokar raajnneeti se judye ke liye vivash ho jaataa tha
 "that is why Gandhi used to say that there is no point in finding a moral or spiritual excuse to turn away from the politics of the elite of India or to despise it
" apane intervyuu main jab hamane gandhi ke aarthik vichaaron kii praasangikta par charchaa kii to professor brown ne ek aashcharya main daalane vaali tulana saamne rakhi
 He said that if India wants to follow Gandhi's economic teachings, then it should follow North Korea
 jab maine kaha ki gandhi ke vichaaron kii tulana us taanaashaahee vaale desh se bhala kaise kii ja sakati he, to ve hansane lageen or jawaab diya, ‘‘uttar korea ne baaki duniya se khud ko alag kar liya he or bharat ko gandhi ke raste par chalanaa he to use bhi duniya ke upabhoktavaad or duusari shaktiyon se bachane ke liye khud ko alag karnaa hoga
 "I need a moral perspective," i asked, "so does this mean that Gandhi's economics have become irrelevant or, in other words, impractical?" Brown said, "I think Gandhi's moral hypothesis Can not dismiss samaaj ke liye naitik pariklpana aisi honi chahie, jisamen vah dekhe ki vah kidar ja rahaa he or vah raajnneetik acshan kaa aadhaar bane
 We do not think that we have come into the world just to make money and to build our house
 ’’hamen sachmuch ek aise naitiktavaadi nazariye kii jarurat he, jo aaj gandhi kii praasangikta par brown ke nazariye ko sahi tehraata ho
 He told me, "all Gandhi's answers to India's problems were based on a completely different moral hypothesis of Indian society
" apane bhaashan main unhone yah bhi bataaya ki kyon bharat gandhi kii naitikta main ruchi nahin rakhata
 He b
 aar
 Quoted a quote from Nanda, in which he said, "it is necessary that the image of Gandhi should not be made of God
 ’’nanda chaahate the ki gandhi ko ek manushya ke taur par yaad kiya jaae, na ki bhagwaan ke rup main
 "remember him as a human who worked hard to establish such values
" uskaa sammaan to sabhi karte hai, lekin vyavhaar main uskaa paalan nahin karte
 "india may not have given Gandhi the status of God but has enshrined him at a checkpoint
" kisi ko apraasangik banane ke liye isse acha koi tarika nahin

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Palestine in February next year
 videsh mantralay ke adhikari isaki taiyaariyon main jute hue hai
 Earlier, Palestinian Ambassador to Pakistan Waleed Abu Ali shared the stage with Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the Mumbai terror attack, created a ruckus

 So the Palestinian Ambassador to India, Adnan Abu Al Haiza, immediately swung into action and clarified the controversy over sharing the stage with Hafiz Saeed
 hija ne kaha ki hamaare rajdoot valid abu ali hafiz said ko nahin jaanate the
 When he started speaking, he also asked who is this (hafiz Saeed)? Our Ambassador's speech was after Hafiz Saeed
 hafiz said apana bhaashan diya or chalaa gaya
 On India's strong opposition, Haiza said that Palestine is also not tolerant of sharing the stage with terrorist Hafiz Saeed
 isi vajah sewalid abu ali ko waapas bulaane kaa faislalia gaya he
 He said that we support India in the fight against terrorism
 yahi vajah he ki philistin sarkaar ne valid abu ali ko pakistan se sidhe waapas bulaane kaa faisla liya he
 Palestinian Ambassador to India Haiza also said that PM Modi is a respected guest of Palestine
 ham philistin main unka swaagat karte hai
 We look forward to his visit to Palestine
 hamen ummid he ki wo jald hi philistin kaa daura karenge

 The matter of this firing is also coming in the police investigation
 postmortem report main munna bajrangi ke sharir se 7 goliyaan nikali hai, jabaki mauka e vaardaat se police ne goliyon ke 10 khokhe baraamad kiye the
 According to STF, when Sunil Rathi was convinced that Munna Bajrangi's breath had erupted, he fired three more in happiness

 Police have found many other things shocking in the investigation
 hatya ke baad sunil rathi ne pistal ko jail ke gater main daal diya tha
 When that gutter is cleaned, there are bottles of liquor inside the gutter
 suniyojit tha munna bajrangi kaa murderpulice tafteesh main yah bhi saamne aayaa he ki hatya ke pehali raat munna bajrangi or sunil rathi ek duusare se gale mili the or duusare kaidi sunheda ke saath baithkar teenon ne sharaab bhi pi thi
 It is being told that the gate of High Security Barrack opened as usual at 6:15 am on the day of the incident
 usee vakt sunil or uske kuch sahyogi duusare barrack se vahaan pahunche the
 After this, they carried out the murder
 is baat kii jaanch chal rahi he ki hatya ke turant baad vahaan tasviren kisne khinchi or kaise viral hui
 According to Chandra Prakash, a pistol that was already present inside the jail, the pistol used for the murder is Banihui of Munger in Bihar
 yah desi pistal he, lekin kaaphi hitech he
 No weapon of any kind can be carried within the High Security Zone, but how the weapon reached the jail is being investigated in this case
 sabase bada sawaal yah he ki aakhir sunil rathi tak vah pistal kaise pahunchi? pistal pahunchane ke liye jimmedaar ek gang par police kii najar he
 Initial investigations suggest that the pistol used in the murder was already in jail
 isaki sambhaavna kaaphi kam he ki raat main pistal laai gai ho

 Two films are being released on this Friday and both of them are female-oriented by coincidence

 In this film, Raveena is going to be seen after a long time and actors like Madhur Mittal, Divya Jagdale, Rushad Rana, Anurag Arora, Alisha Khan and Shailendra Goyal Jo are going to be seen in strong style
 'matra' kaa nirdesan debyutent derector ashtar syed kar rahe hai or is film ko maaikel pelico ne likhaa he
 'matru' is a revenge story of a mother whose daughter gets raped in front of her eyes

 The comments har baar kii tarah is baar bhi ham is film kii khubiyaan or khami kii baat karenge
 The first drawback of 'mother' is its story which is predictable and you get a foreshadowing of it
 trailor dekhakar hi aapako andaaza ho jaataa he kii ye film ek badale kii kahani he
 The second drawback of the film was in the song
 film ke gane sunne main to achche lagate hai lekin iske bachi ke seen kii avadhi kam hoti to behatar hota
 In the film, he has been used as montages where he has described the pain of a mother
 ek or baat aap ise fiction kii tarah dekhen to film main koi kami najar nahin aaengi or agar aapane isamen logic lagaaya to ho saktaa he aapakon isamen kanoonee daanv-pech kii kamiyaan dikhaai de sakati hai
 Now let's talk about the merits of this film
 is film kii sabase badi khubi he iskaa screen play jo aapako hilne nahin detaa
 Like i said, despite the story being predictable, its screen play keeps you hooked
 kai seens aapako saans roak kar film dekhne ko majaboor kar dete hai or parde par ghat rahi ghatnaayen aapke dil kii dhadakanen tej kar detii hai or cinema haul main ye samaa baandhne ke liye screen play ke saath saath nirdesan or abhinay kaa bhi bahut bada haath he
 Ashtaar's tight direction makes the scenes effective and puts Raveena's acting in it
 yun to ravina ne kai baar khud ko behtareen kalakaar sabit kiya he par is film main kai jagah unke abhinay kii baarikiyaan ishaara karti hai kii ravina vakt ke saath or paripakv abhinetri ke taur par ubhar raheen he jahaan kirdaar ke sur se wo zaraa bhi bhatakati nazar nahin aatin
 Apart from Raveena, Madhur also makes a strong impression in the negative role and apart from this, Anurag Arora and Shailendra Goyal will be able to impress you with their effortless and effective acting
 film kii cinemotographi or becoground score film kii kahani se sur milaataa he or prabhaavshaalee he
 The best part is that in the filming of many scenes, the director has retained the reality and does not let them be filmy or dramatic which proves to be effective to watch
 mere hisaab se 'matra' ek acchhee film he or ise meri taraf se 4 stars
 Like every time, this time also we will talk about the merits and demerits of this film
 'matra' kii pehali kami he isaki kahani jo kii pridictible he or aapako iskaa purvabhaas ho jaataa he
 Seeing the trailer, you realize that this film is a revenge story
 film kii duusari kami mujhe iske gane main lagi
 The songs of the film are good to listen to, but if the duration of the remaining scene is short, it would be better
 film main inhen montages kii tarah istemaal kiya gaya he jahaan inke jariye ek maa kaa dard bayaan kiya gaya he
 One more thing, if you look at it like fiction, then there will be no shortage in the film and if you put logic in it, then maybe you can see the drawbacks of legal betting
 ab baat karte hai is film kii khoobiyon kii
 The biggest feature of this film is its screen play which does not let you move
 jaise maine kaha kii kahani pridictable hote hue bhi iskaa screen play aapako baandhe rakhata he
 Many scenes make you hold your breath and watch the film and the events happening on the screen make your heart beat and screen play along with directing and acting are also very big hand in the cinema hall
 
 ashtar kaa ksaa hua nirdesan drishyon ko asardaar banaata he or usamen chaar chand lagaataa he ravina kaa abhinay
 Although Raveena has proved herself to be a great performer many times, but in this film, the nuances of her acting in many places indicate that Raveena is emerging as a mature actress with time and where she is distracted by the character
 Do not come
 ravina ke alaava madhur bhi negative role main jabardast chhap chhodte hai or inke alaava anuraag aroda or shailendra goyal apane sahaj or asardaar abhinay se aap par prabhaav chhodane me kaamyaab honge
 The film's cinematography and background score adds to the film's story and is impressive
 sabase acchhee baat ye he ki kai drishyon ke filmakan main nirdeshak ne vaastaviktaa barkaraar rakhi he or unhe filmi yaa naatakeey nahin hone diya he jo dekhne main asardaar sabit hota he
 According to me, 'mother' is a good film and 4 stars from my side

 Delhi came to power, the Arvind Kejriwal government is now about to introduce the Lokayukta bill

 ' gauratlab he ki lokayukta kii niyukti nahin ho paane or janalokapal vidheyak ke pesh nahin kiye jane ko lekar bijepibhi kejariwal sarkaarper nishaanaa sadhti rahi he
 Delhi BJP had asked the government to give a time frame in this direction about a month ago
 3 / 2 / 14: Kejriwal passed Jan Lokpal Bill in his Cabinet
 14 / 4 / 15: Claims to again start work on it
 Now says its almost done
 Whats going on? - Prashant Bhushan (@ pbhushan1) September 28, 2015 bjp's Delhi unit president Satish Upadhyay had said in August, 'this government has been over six months, but neither has appointed Lokayukta and Nor did Janlokpal bring the bill as promised
 kejariwal sarkaar ne janalokapal auraswaraj kaa istemalasirf vot ke liye kiya
 He is not serious at all
 'unhone aage kaha tha ki 'aap' sarkaar kii buniyaad hi lokapal andolan ke jariye padi
 Before the election, he promised to introduce the Jan Lokpal Bill soon
 apni pehali sarkaar ke samay janalokapal ke mudde par hi kejariwal ne istipha de diya tha, lekin ab pataa chal gaya ki yah party lokapal or swaraj ko lekar kitni gambhir he

 If a party is talking about giving reservation to upper castes, then in some party it is being made state president
 yahaan tak ki pichhadon kii raajnneeti karne vaali party argedy ekbrahmanko rajyasabha bhejti he, to duusari taraf janata dal-you main haal hi shaamil chunavi ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ko mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bhavishya bataate hai
 In Bihar, the Congress has placed a Brahmin in the chair of the state president after 26 years
 purv mukhyamantri dow
 Madan Mohan Jha is the first Brahmin state president after Jagannath Mishra
 party ko lagata he ki vartmaan paristhiti main agar savarna or khaskar brahman, joki uske puraane vot bank rahe hai, agar wo tut jate hai, to unki takat bad jaaegi
 However, Madan Mohan Jha says that by his formation all castes will join the Congress, because Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cheated the public
 do karod logon ko rojgaar dene kaa vaada nahin puraa kar paane, petrol va dijal ke daam badhane or rafel deal samet kai muddon par log modi sarkaar ke khilaaf hai
 These issues are enough to get people in favor of Congress
 ab janata bijepi or uske shashan ko dekh chuki he
 Therefore all castes will come to us
 madan mohan jha ne kaha, 'mujhe mauka diya gaya sirf isliye brahman kaa rujhaan nahin badhegaa, balki sabhi jatiyaan piem modi se dhokhaa milane se naaraaz hai
 The public has seen everything in the four years of NDA rule
 ab sabhi congress kii taraf aa rahe hai
 It is believed that the new team of Kikangres is being formed keeping Lok Sabha elections in mind
 is puri kavayad kaa makasad votaron ko target karnaa he
 The Congress has chosen its target upper caste vote bank
 pichhadaa or ati pichhadaa vot bank usne mahagathbandhan kii partiyon ko saunpi he
 a team of 48 has been formed in the State Congress Committee, of which Madan Mohan Jha is the State President, while Akhilesh Prasad Singh has been made the Chairman of the Election Campaign Committee
 iske alaava 4 kaaryakari adhyaksh he, jisamen do savarna jati se hai or ek alpsankhyak he
 Only 8 backward and one backward have been given place in the committee
 isse saaf jaahir hota he ki congress kaa target kya he? haalanki savarnon ke vot bank ko lekar chalane vaali bijepi isse zyada chintit nahin najar aa rahi he
 He believes that the Congress should try hard, but the upper castes will not go with it, as they are standing with the RJD
 bijepi ke varisht netaa aurabihar sarkarmen mantri nandakishor yadav kaa kahana he ki isi argedy ne bihar main bhura bal saaf karon kaa naaraa diya tha
 He said, 'who makes the Congress party president, it is not a matter
 unka andruni maamla he, lekin congress ek baat bhuulati he ki kisi jati vishesh ko pad par baitha dene se us samaaj kaa vot nahin mil jaataa he
 i laugh at the insolvency of the wisdom of the Congress, but one thing the Congress is forgetting is that the Congress is working with the RJD in Bihar by compromising
 'yadav ne kaha, 'argedico bada bhai maanati he or isi argedy ne bihar ke andar bhura bal saaf karo kaa naaraa diya tha
 People of Bihar will not accept the party that will work with the party that gives a brown hair clean slogan
 congress jise chaahe use adhyaksh bana le, lekin bhram main na rahe ki bihar ke log ab congress or argedy ko vot dene vaale hai
 There is no harm to the BJP, as the entire society is with us

 mantri hazari kaa kahana he ki jab bangale ko sabase varisht mantri matlab cabinet main number 2 ke naam se ab chihnit kar diya gaya he, isliye tejasvi yadav ke aagrah ko mana nahin ja saktaa
 Tejashwi also said many why he is being shown haste to evict the bungalow? Now the former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister may have to vacate the bungalow after the High Court verdict
 Happy Navratri to everyone, May Mata Rani bless,protect and make us stronger
 Have faith and the see her magic unfold

 He was not afraid to see the terrorists dying with his own eyes, but he went ahead and tried to mask the terrorists' faces

 unhone kaha ki pichde musalamaanon ko aarakshan kaa maamla supreme court main lambit he or jab tak sheersh adaalat main is maamle kaa nipataara nahin hota party kuch nahin kar sakati
 He said, 'these are just suggestions that came during the process of consultation with the public
 hamane ise janata ke samaksh rakhaa he
 When the Congress comes to power, it will advance public opinion
 ye nitiyon or kaaryakramon ke suzav hai jo ghoshnaptr paraamarsh kii prakriya ke dauraan aaye the

 2 ji spectrum ghotaale ko lekar istipha dene ko baadhya kiye gaye purv doorsanchaar mantri e raja ne ucchtam nyaayalay se kaha ki vah aisa mahasoos karte hai ki unhen khalanaayak bana diya gaya he
 a bench of Justices GS Singhvi and AK Ganguly said that they need not feel so
 2 ji spectrum maamle kii sunwaayee ke anya charan main raja kii ore se pesh hue varisht adhivaktaa tii aar andhyajrun ne kaha, ‘meri (raja) sthiti aaj itani kharaab he ki main jo kuch bhi kahuunga vah meri pratishtha nahin bachaa saktaa
 Andhayajarun said that Raja is being condemned as a villain on all sides and especially in the media
 apni daleelein shuru karte hue aam raay ke maddenjar andhyajrun ne kaha, ‘maanakon kaa abhaav he or dukhad ehsaas he ki aaj sari sansthaaen vifal ho gai hai
 Today i am considered a villain
 ’haalanki, peeth ne unhen aashwast karte hue kaha, ‘aisa mahasoos na karen
 'andhyajarun said,' i am presenting as a condemned person
 mujhapar aarope lagaaya gaya, mukadmaa chalaa or media kii najaron main main doshi hum
 'he said,' It's like 1
 76 lakh karod rupee ke nuksaan ke liye main jimmedaar hum
 'he said,' His silence is being taken as an admission of guilt
 dharna yah he ki itani badi raashi ke nuksaan ke liye main jimmedaar hum jo dimag chakaraane vaala he
 The lawyer then questioned the conclusions of the CAG and the manner in which the draft report was leaked before the final report was tabled in Parliament
 isapar peeth ne palatakar sawaal poocha ki kya report kii gopneeyata ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye koi niyam he kyonki yah ‘ucch sanvaidhanik sanstha’ he
 The bench said, "are there any rules regarding confidentiality?" ham udhaaharan de rahe hai
 When one of the judges prepares the draft decision, it is not public until it is signed and heard
 yah lok sanstha ke liye jaruri he
 Is there any such rule? yah ucch sanvaidhanik santhaan he
 Both Andhayajarun and the Solicitor General Gopal Subrahmanyam said that the process is that the report will be forwarded to the President first
 vah iske baad ise sansad main rakhane kaa nirdesh dengi
 However, advocate Prashant Bhushan of the Center for Public Interest Litigation said that the CAG has no exemption from the disclosure of the report under the RTI Act
 isapar peeth ne kaha, ‘kya ise sansad main charchaa se pehle saarvajanik kiya ja saktaa he
 The verdicts are being pronounced outside (virtually referring to the media report)
 aaj yah maahaul he ki media or (channelon ke) studio ke paas daudane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he jisamen hamaare samudaay ke sadsy bhi shaamil hai

 When Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said last Wednesday that the Bharatiya Janata Party has a hand in the doctors' strike since December 21, his statement was ignored by none other than Gehlot's sympathizers in the Congress high command
 ve hamdard jo naakaami ko dhakne ke liye unke is tarah ke bayanon ko fouran lapak lete hai
 04 January 2012: See in pictures India Today The current strike by doctors is another special example of the unconscious Gehlot government
 doctoron ke saath 11 july ko hue samjhaute par amal ke liye sarkaar 20 disambar tak nahin jaagi
 The complaint of doctors is valid
 rajya main doctor dashakon se nijee practice ke alaava dawa companiyon or medical jaanch kii prayogshaalaon ke kamishan se kamaate aa rahe hai
 His salary is low
 medical collejon ke prophessoron ko bhi akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan (ames) main apane samakakshon ke mukaable ek-tihaai selary hi milti he
 The result of this approach was that most doctors considered it appropriate to focus on private practice by not spending much time in research etc
 vah bhi duty ke ghanton main
 Usually, the private practice of doctors also decreases significantly after retiring from government service
 aisa isliye kyonki unamem se kai swatantra rup se pratishthit doctor ke rup main khud ko nahin jamaa pate or unke zyaadaatar marij bhi un aspataalon se bheje gaye log hote hai jahaan ve tainaat hote hai
 December 28, 2011: Look at the pictures India Today began to change
 yuva doctoron kii badhati sankhya se halaat aise mukaam tak pahunch gaye, jahaan nijee practice kii kamai bhi ghatane lagi
 The government had a golden opportunity
 vah nijee practice chhodane vaale doctoron ko oonchi tankhwaah kii peshkash karke unhen shodh ke liye samay dene ko protsaahit kar sakati thi
 However, any such suggestion is strongly opposed by senior doctors who earn more from private practice
 sarkaar ke paas gahalot kii dharre vaali us puraani raay se alag koi drushti bhi nahin
 28 December 2011: See India Today in the pictures, which is why doctors have gone on strike several times since he took office
 jaahir he, iskaa chikitsa sevaaon par bura asar hota he
 For example, maternal deaths occurred in Jodhpur
 isse kharaab chikitsa suvidha ke saath-saath behatar quality kii glucose kii botalon kii supplai kii naakaami bhi ujagar hui
 In the episode of similar incidents, children were given infectious blood
 swine flu failaa to prashasan so rahaa tha
 There have been many incidents' when the Timadars of the patients beat up the doctors, accusing them of negligence
 yah sach he rajya main doctoron or swasthya sevaaon par bahut bada dabaav he
 14 December 2011: In the pictures, instead of providing a safe work environment to India todoctors or interacting with them, Gehlot made some such statements: "private doctors also put the dead on ventilators to make money
" doctor kamishan se kamai karte hai or jab hamane marijon ko muft dawa uplabdh karai to unhone hadtaal kar di
 If they do not return to work, the public will teach them a lesson
 '' in bayanon se jaahir he ki gahalot ne shuru se hi doctoron ke peshey ke khilaaf khundak paal rakhi he
 That is why the government put them in jails instead of keeping them in a guesthouse to talk to the arrested doctors
 doctoron ke khilaaf gahalot ke is anargal bayaan kii pehle bhi tikhi aalochana hui he
 The BJP and some others have asked for steps to improve medical services instead of all this
 doctoron ke khilaaf kathor karrwai dikhaakar gahalot ek tarah se shuddh raajnneeti kar rahe hai kyonki unhen pataa he ki log apane kashton ke liye doctoron par hi naaraaz honge
 Minister of State for Health Rajkumar Sharma says that Gehlot himself is keeping an eye on the demand of doctors
 gahalot yah dikhaanaa chaahate hai ki swasthya mantri durru miyaan kii maatahati main swasthya or chikitsa vibhaag thik se kaam nahin kar rahaa
 So the decision was delayed on the demand of doctors
 ab khud gahalot par hi aarope hai ki ve bahut hi susti se kaam karte hai jo naakaamiyaan chhipaane kii khaas style he
 07 December 2011: See India Today in pictures congress mahasachiv digvijay sinhane kaha he ki unhen yah daawa karne main jaraa bhi sankoch nahin he ki shivaraj singh chouhan madhya pradesh ke itihaas main sab se zyada darpok mukhyamantri sabit hue hai
 The Congress general secretary said that his vote was formed because it has been more than five years since Chauhan became the chief minister, but till date he has not addressed a single official press conference
 digvijay singh ne kaha ki unhen is baat se hairaani isliye he kyonki chouhan ke pehle madhya pradesh main jitne bhi mukhyamantri hue un sab ne hameshaa kai baar patrkaar vaartaayen karwaain
 He clarified that the official press conference takes place in the state secretariat
 unhone kaha ki ve swayan bhi das saal tak madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri rahe hai or yah baat sab ko pataa he ki unke kaarykaal main ve niyamit rup se patrkaar vaarta ko sambodhit karte the or media kii ore se aaye kisi bhi sawaal kaa bejhijak jawaab diya karte the
 The Congress General Secretary said that Chauhan's stay away from the media like this also raises many questions because he had made the biggest promises about the progress of Madhya Pradesh as compared to the earlier Chief Ministers
 digvijay singh ne kaha ki agar chouhan sachmuch madhya pradesh ke liye bahut hi acha kaam kar rahe he or ve vaaki ek svarnim madhya pradesh ke liye karyrat he to unhen media se darane kii jaraa bhi jarurat nahin he
 Digvijay Singh alleged that it is well known that there are three note counting machines installed at Chauhan's residence at this time and it is evident that these are not kept just to count the Chief Minister's salary

 " The latest issue of the well-known magazine Samayik Saraswati is an attempt to re-understand the relevance of Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, one of the most eminent critics of Hindi
 is ank ke sampadak dinesh kumaar ne sahi likhaa he ki sahitya kii raksha karte hue uski saamaajik sarthakata ko mahatv dene vaale pehle aalochak hai acharya ramchandra shukla
 Before Shukla ji, there was a zero in Hindi criticism, there were no definite principles for examining and examining his contemporary and ancient literature and concepts
 is sandarbh main mahakavi dev evam bihari par likhi gai lala bhagavanadin evam pa
 There is mention of a complimentary and comparative review of the poetry of Padma Singh Sharma
 in donon samikshakon ne farsi, urdu evam sanskrit kavita se in kaviyon kii tulana kii or vaah-vaah kii jhadi laga di
 Ratnakar ji also did this work in a different way, naturally it would have damaged the image of what would have been good for Hindi criticism
 haalanki, donon aalochak hindi kavyashastra ke marmajna the par apane samkaal ko lekar missfit rahe or thik yaheen se utpann shunya ko bharte hue acharya shukla ne hindi kii saidhantik evam vyaavhaarik aalochana ko ek vyavasthit rup diya
 He freed Hindi criticism from the imitation of Sanskrit poetry, while on the other hand he also avoided the imitation of Western criticism
 unhonen hi 'lokmagal kii sadhnavastha', 'lokmagal kii siddhavastha', 'karm soundarya', 'virudhon kaa saamanjasy', 'galp prabandh', 'prasang garbhtv', 'shildasha' jaise pad or avadharanaen deen
 He edited the poetic arrangements of Tulsi, Jayasi, Surdas and by writing his detailed roles, he set new dimensions of poetic evaluation
 isi ke samanaantar unhone do aitihaasik kaary or kiye- hindi shabd sagar kaa sampaadan evam hindi sahitya ke itihaas kaa lekhan
 No other book got the reputation of this book in the Hindi world
 shukla ji kii sthapanaayen aaj bhi veda vaakya ke samaan he or hindi ke 80 fisadi praadhyaapak-aalochak unheen ke maarg kaa anusaran kar rahe hai, yah hindi kaa durbhaagya he
 In fact, Acharya Shukla's opposition in a section of Hindi critics is about his Kabir-related outlook and ideas in cinematography, story and novel
 or isaki shuruyaat hindi ke sarvaadhik jindadil aalochak dow
 Namvar Singh did this from the book 'discovery of another tradition' written on his guru Acharya Hazari Prasad Dwivedi
 ullekhneey he ki yahaan sankalit adhikansh lekh prakarantar se usee pustak kii avadharanaon se virodh jataate hue shukla ji ke vichaaron ko punarsthapit karne kii koshish he
 While Shukla ji does not pose any threat to prestige, after all the importance of any critic or creator is given by how much debate or writing is there, that is, how much you can cross-examine them
 is sandarbh main ham agar hindi aalochana ke itihaas ko khangale to shukla ji ke vichaaron se sabhi mahatvapurn yatha vijay dev narayan saahi, ramvilas sharma, nand dulaare bajpeyi, acharya hazari prasad dvivedi, namvar singh aadi ne gahare ja kar muthbhed kii he or hindi aalochana ko samrudh kiya he
 And after this background, scholars compiled in this issue like Madhuresh, Sudhish Pachauri, Professor Gopeshwar Singh, Ravi Ranjan, Shri Bhagwan Singh, Sadanand Shahi, Kamlesh Verma, Dr
 radhavallabh treepathi, omprakash singh evam vijaybahadur singh ke lekh par kuch baaten
 These articles refer to Acharya Shukla's review theories, his concepts, the range of his era, his encounter with Western poetry, Tulsi, Jayasi, Shukla's perspective on Kabir, his anorexia about ritualistic poets, his ideology on cinematography, mysticism etc
 Various critical approaches have been written analyzing and thus helpful in understanding Shukla's critical writings
 ullekhneey kahuun yaa durbhaagya ki adhikansh lekh shukla ji ko lekar shraddhavigalit rukh kaa hi poshan karte hai
 a kind of rhetorical vision makes most of the writers gathered here dr
 namvar singh ke shukla ji se sambandhit vichaaron khaskar lok sambandhit unki avadharana ko lekar aapatti he
 In this context, i would definitely like to say that no writer has mentioned Namvar Ji's new approach to Shukla Ji's critical work
 namvar ji ne pichley varsh hi ramchandra shukla granthawali kaa sampaadan kiya he, or vistrut bhoomika likhakar shukla ji ko lekar faile kuhase ko saafe karne kii koshish kii he
 If i say clearly that the article is important and invite debate but the mentor of Vijay Bahadur Singh, Shukla's most brilliant disciple Nand Dulare Bajpai, about his guru and Sadanand Shahi's writings are remarkable
 sudhish pachori gambhir lekh likhte hue bhi apane khilanddana swabhaav ko nahin chhodte or vyangy kar jate hai jo shukla ji ke bhakton ko nagavar guzar saktaa he
 Fine material
 sampadak dinesh kumaar iske liye badhai ke paatr hai
 It would be better to draw specials on the personality work of Trilochan Shastri and Kedarnath Singh
 ramchandra shukla jaise vatvriksh sadaiv praasangik hai or rahenge
 They can be talked about in a leisure time
 maine sthanbhav ke kaaran un likhon kii babat gaharaai se baat nahin kii he or itihaas-drushti, darshan aadi kai avadharanaon ko ojhal kiya he
 There is hope that serious readers will think this issue on them again sometime
