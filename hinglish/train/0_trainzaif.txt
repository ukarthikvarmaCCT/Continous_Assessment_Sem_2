 Today Nawaz Sharif's flag is waving in Pakistan
 kareeb chaudaa baras baad sharif ke haathon main pakistan kii satta lauti he
 The throne was also snatched, got the country removed
 lekin jamhuriyat kii jang main sharif ek baar phir hero hai
 Now the celebrations have also started, Nawaz Sharif has also thanked Awam, Sharif has just a few formalities from power
 magar siyasat navaj sharif kaa makasad nahin tha
 Just say that there was a coincidence and everything went on
 asal main sharif parivaar kaa steel udyog tha or sarkaar ne usapar kabja kar liya tha
 Nawaz Sharif came to politics to take back that industry
 1980 main pakistan ke punjab ke gavarvar gulam jilani khan ko nae yuva netaaon kii talash thi
 Nawaz was the result of the same search and soon Nawaz Sharif was made the Finance Minister of Punjab province
 agle hi saal unhen 1981 main jiya ul haq ke salaahkaar board main shaamil bhi kar liya gaya
 Then such a journey of politics started that in 1990 he reached the chair of the Prime Minister
 saal 1990 se 1993 tak or 1997 se 1999 tak sharif do baar pakistan ke pradhanmantri rahe
 Unique relationship between Mian Nawaz Sharif and General Pervez Musharraf Nawaz Sharif and the Pakistan Army have also had a very unique relationship in this field of politics

 Went to jail, got even to Exile lekin har ladaai ke baad aaj phir se pakistan kii gaddi unhen pukaar rahi he
 Sharif is the hero once again in the battle of Jamhooriyat
 vakt kaa pahiyaa ghumta he to kaise halaat badalte hai, ye sharif se behatar bhala or koun samaj saktaa he
 It was Nawaz Sharif who handed over the command of Pakistan Army Chief to Pervez Musharraf
 tab unhen kahaan pataa tha ki agle hi baras ye musharraf unki takht hi palat kar rakh denge
 The coup took place in 1999
 saal 2000 main bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaakar navaj sharif ko desh nikaala de diya gaya
 He lived in Saudi Arabia for 7 years
 2007 main pakistan laute or 2008 main chunaav bhi lade
 In the course of time, the same Musharraf who had got the country expelled, Musharraf had to leave the throne as well as the country
 5 saal baad musharraf bhi laute, is ummid ke saath ki desh main chunaav jitkar phir gaddi par baithenge
 But, quit winning the election, you cannot even fight and now the situation is that they will have to spend years in jail
 siyasat ke is khel main aage or bhi bahut kuch ho saktaa he

 Shocking practice is going on in Tamil Nadu government schools
 yahaan par chaatro kii jati kii pahchaan karne ke liye unhen haathon par alag-alag rang kii pattee pahanane ko majaboor kiya jaataa he
 The shocking thing is that BJP national secretary h Raja has supported this practice
 rangeen pattiyon se jati kii pahachanareport ke mutabik ye pattiyaan laal, pili, hari or bhagava rang kii hoti he
 These strips are identified to identify children from the forward and backward castes
 iske alaava 'tilak' ke dwaara bhi bacchon kii jati kii pahchaan kii jaati he
 According to the report, this practice is used to select sports teams, to bring students back to class during the afternoon break
 mana jaataa he ki dabang kism ke log or shikshak jaan boojhkar is pratha ko badhaava dete hai
 Trainee IAS caught discriminating This practice going on in Tamil Nadu school was disclosed by some IAS officers
 in afasaron ne tamilnadu sarkaar ke shiksha vibhaag ko bataaya ki bacchon kii kalai par alag-alag ragon kii pattiyaan baandhi jaati he
 This shows that these children are of forward caste or backward caste
 shiksha nideshak ne jari kiya circularais khulaase ke baad shiksha vibhaag main hadakamp much gaya
 The Director of Education issued a circular to all the Chief Education Officers of the state, that immediately such schools should be identified and immediate action should be taken against such practice
 bijepi ne kiya badlaav kaa vironshiksha vibhaag kaa ye circular jaise hi surkhiyon main aayaa bavaal much gaya
 However, Bharatiya Janata Party leader h Raja from Tamil Nadu has received a shocking response to the case
 ech raja he ne kaha he ki chaatro ko dharmik pratikon ko dikhaane se rokna rajya sarkaar kaa hindu virdohi kadam he
 h Raja said that there is no restriction on wearing wristbands and applying tilak in schools, the School Education Minister says that he was not given any information about this circular, so the officer who issued this circular acted against it Should be known tamilnadu ke schuli shiksha mantri ke e cengottian ne kaha ki skulon main in cast bainds ko pahanane par koi roak nahin he
 He also said that the circular through which the wearing of these bands is banned will not be implemented
 unhone kaha ki ye circular bina unki jaankaree ke jari kiya gaya tha or iskaa makasad vivaad paidaa karnaa tha
 AIADMK Sarkar Education Minister k a Sengottian, who is divided into two camps, may be supportive of wearing bands that identify caste identity in schools, but Tamil Nadu Fisheries Minister d Jayakumar has a different opinion
 unhone kaha ki skulon se or shiksha pranali se jati ko khatm kiya janaa chahie
 d Jayakumar said that there should be no discrimination on the basis of caste, and his government would work on it
 sansad main jari gatirodh ke khilaaf chandani chowk main 1 din ke upwas par baithe kendriya mantri dow
 Harshvardhan said that BJP mps are committed to making India the dream of Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha ki vipaksh jis tarah se sansad main gatirodh paidaa kar rahaa he, usee baat ko janata tak pahunchane ke liye ham log anshan kar rahe hai
 Dr
 Harsh Vardhan said that if the opposition is calling for democracy, then it should know that it is not noise and talk, issues are resolved through dialogue
 vipaksh sirf shor machaata he
 The public conscience of the country is not zero
 4 saal pradhanmantri modi ko unhone kaam karte hue dekha he
 Have seen his work, his truth, his honesty, his depth
 unke jazbe ko dekha he or kis tarah se unka dil dhadkta he
 For the poor, Dalits, farmers, laborers, the people of the country have seen this and the result is that there is a BJP government in 21 states today
 duniya kii sabase badi loktantric party banakar bijepi ubhari he
 Harsh Vardhan said, we need a certificate from the people of the country, not the Congress, on hunger strike
 desh kii janata bataaegi ki sabase kaabil or sabase yogya pradhanmantri koun he
 That is why the people of the country are blessing Prime Minister Modi
 kendriya mantrine kaha ki dinadayal upaadhyaay, kushabhau thakare, shyama prasad mukherjee, laalkrishna adwani, narendra modi, amit shah jaise netaaon se prerana lekar ham log bharat kii raajnneeti main kaam kar rahe hai

 aap sabhi apane paaltu jaanavar se behad pyaar karte hai, lekin kya kabhi aapane uske saath ghar basaane ke bare main sochaa he
 Probably not, but there is a man who wants to get married with his cat
 germany ke mashhoor fishan dijainer karl letherfeld apni billi se is kadar pyaar karte hai ki unhone paris main apane mension main uske liye do nijee naukaraaniyaan rakhi hai taaki ve 24 ghante uski dekhbhaal kar saken
 Not only this, he even says that he loves his cat so much that in a way he is his 'mistress'
 ab unka kahana he ki agar vah apni billi se shaadi se kar pate to aisa jarur karte
 77-year-old fashion guru Lagerfeld says he never thought he would love his 22-month-old cat so much
 letherfeld kii is billi ke thaat-baat kisi rajkumaari se kam nahin he
 This cat has dinner at its own table
 billi ke paas khud kaa ypad he jisase uski tasviren khinchi jaati hai
 Not only this, he also has his own Twitter account, which has 27,000 followers
 uske naam par fasebuk pej bhi he, jise ab tak 1,276 log like kar chuke hai
 Not only this, Laserfleed is so adorable in the love of his cat that he even inspired the design of one of his collections, inspired by his eyes
 jab letherfeld ghar par nahin hote hai tab naukaraaniyaan vah sab kuch ek choti kitaab main likhti hai jo billi us vakt karti he
 When Lagerfeld comes back, he reads that book
 ek tivi intervyuu main letherfeld ne kaha ki ve is baat se behad dukhi hai ki aadmi or jaanavar kii shaadi kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 He says, 'I didn't know that i would fall in love with my cat to this extent
 'letherfeld ne ek saal pehle is billi ko god liya tha
 Once the cat fell ill, Lagerfeld called the doctor at midnight because he did not want to wait until morning
 aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki letherfeld kii billi din main do baar brush karti he or akasar use mancur karaayaa jaataa he
 Chasing insects and tearing paper in his private garden is his favorite job
 har saal raashtrapati bhawan main bhavy samaaroh hota he, jabapadam puraskaradie jate hai
 The government selects the people who specialize in their own fun and confers them with special civic honors
 lekin is baar padam samaaroh ke kuch din baad hi ye vivaadon main ghir gaya he
 The new controversy has arisen from the statement of JDU President Sharad Yadav
 padam shri mere level kaa nahin he: saleem khanjediu adhyaksh sharad yadav apane vivaadit bol se phir surkhiyon main hai
 This time Sharad Yadav has attacked the Padma award
 sharad yadav ne mumbai main ye kahkar padam puraskaron par hamalaa bolaa or kaha ki padam puraskaar sirf makkaaron, beyimaanon or bade logon kaa miltaa he
 He questioned the poor and the tribals as to why no one has been chosen from among the tribals for the Padma Awards so far
 gauratlab he ki kuch din pehle lekhak saleem khan ne padmashri lene se inkaar kar diya tha
 He said that his personality is older than Padma Shri
 saleem khan or ab sharad yadav ke sawaal sirf padam puraskaar kii chayan prakiya par sawaal nahin hai balki desh ke sabase vishisht naagarik sammaanon ko lekar najariyon par bhi sawaal he
 Sharad Yadav had also questioned the dusky Surat few days back
 tab khub hangaamaa barapa
 It was also associated with female honor and racial commentary
 nayaa vivaadit bayaan padam puraskaron par he
 Obviously, this too is not going to stop

 'campus ke hamamen se zyaadaatar log, chaatr or shikshak, is mahaan sarkari vishvavidhyalay ko nasht kiya jaataa dekh rahe hai
 An indecent attempt is being made to destroy this institution with a glorious past, and the current fee hike movement of JNU students is a new twist in it
 santhaan ko nasht karne kii prakriya ke agua maujuuda kulapati em
 Jagadesh Kumar and it started with his appointment in January 2016
 prastaavit fees vruddhi—jo jeenyu prashasan kaa apane chaatro ko sabase taaja jhatka he—ke saath akelaa fark yah he ki iske natijatan ucch shiksha hasil karne kii ichha rakhane vaale chaatro ko tatkaal bich main hi padhai chhodmai padegi or iske saath judaa hoga bahishkaar kaa apmaan or sapanom ke tut jane kii traasadee
 Whose dreams and future are we talking about? In 2018-19, 53 per cent of the total students enrolled in JNU were girls; About 60 per cent of those enrolled were from SC, ST and OBC families; More than 40 percent of the students came from families with a monthly income of Rs 12,000 or less
 is kism kaa saamaajik tanabana kai varshon ke dauraan hasil kiya gaya or yah jeenyu kii pragatisheel daakhila niti kii badaulat badhata rahaa
 This policy, which has been in existence since the inception of the university, gives regional deprivation points and gives preference to students from remote and disadvantaged areas of the country
 desh main obisi kota lagu hone se bahut pehle obisi pariwaron ke abhilaashi chaatro ko vanchanaa ank dena jeenyu main sthapit chalan tha
 In 2010, JNU launched a gender-based swatch issue to promote girls and transgender candidates

 programs ke liye vanchanaa ank pradaan karne kii vyavastha khatm kar di gai he
 Apart from fulfilling the social obligations of the welfare state towards its citizens, the social and economic diversity of JNU serves several purposes
 misaal ke liye, jeenyu kii academik utkrushtataa chaatro kii saamaajik vividhta kii vajah se he, uske baavjood nahin
 The unique contribution of knowledge to this university is the biological product of the various ways in which people here have been raised and have lived their lives
 maujuuda vimarshon main jeenyu jin amuly yogadanon ke shrey kaa jaij daawa kar saktaa he, ve jeenyu main uplabdh seekhney-sikhaane ke maahaul kii badaulat sambhav hue hai
 Due to its diversity, solidarity and empathy are maintained between various social divisions
 kul milakar yah bhartiya nagarikon ke nirmaan main asal yogadan detaa he
 This is the character of JNU whose rise in fees has fundamentally changed the threat — more than 40 percent of current students, who come from all disadvantaged backgrounds, will be forced to leave the university
 yahaan tak ki jo log nire rupye-paise main ucch shiksha ke phaaydon kii ginati karte hai, unke liye bhi iskaa arth in chaatro par pehle hi kharch kiye ja chuke 'karadaataaon ke dhan' kii barbaadi hona chahie
 This fee increase, which is being offered as a self-financing model, now includes cleaning and mess staff salaries, fees for essential amenities like water and electricity and much higher room rent
 isse hostel kii salanaa fees kareeb (maujuuda 30,000 rupye se badhkar) 66,000 rupye ho jaaegi
 The 'reduction' in the proposed fee announced on November 13, 2019, is applicable only to students from BPL (below poverty line) families and even after this reduction only the hostel fees are the annual income of the BPL family
 (estimated at Rs 27,000, Digital India, 2016)
 to asal main ghoshit 'kami' campus ke kinhin bhi chaatro par lagu nahin hoti or yah tathy jeenyu ke andolakaari chaatro ko puri tarah pataa he
 There was no consultation with the student union on the decision to increase the fee, which is a violation of the institute's established procedure
 jeenyu ke chaatr sirf apane bhavishya ke liye yaa jeenyu ke us lokachar—jisase ve labhanvit hue hai—ke liye nahin lard rahe hai
 They are also fighting for future generations of underprivileged students, who can realize their dreams through this government institution of higher education
 andolankaaree chaatr yah maun sawaal puch rahe hai: kya ucch shiksha un logon kaa akhet he jo uske liye keemat adaa kar sakate hai?sucharita sen jeenyu ke skool of soshal sciensej main kshetreey vikaas adhyayan centre main professor hai*** Poet and lyricist Javed Akhtar has also plunged into an alleged controversy following the comments of 20-year-old Gulmehar Kaur and has sought wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt and cricketer Virender Sehwag to troll

 You will often hear elders in your house saying that you should avoid eating green leafy vegetables during the rainy season, but if you are eating then try and get it thoroughly washed, cooked
 yun to hari patteydaar subjiyan khaanaa ek acchhee aadat he lekin monsoon main inhen khaanaa khatarnaak bhi ho saktaa he
 Rain is often cloudy due to which plants do not get enough sunlight
 dhoop nahin mil paane ke kaaran in patton main keetanuon ke or bacteriake panpane kii ashanka bad jaati he
 Despite this, if you want green leafy vegetables for lunch and dinner, then first wash them thoroughly
 aap chahen to dhone vaale pani main namak bhi mila sakate hai
 Apart from this, washing vegetables with alum water is also beneficial
 subjiyon ko acchhee tarah dhone ke baad inkaa puri tarah se paknaa bhi jaruri he
 Why such advice is given in the rain? 1
 ye to aapane bhi dekha hoga ki barsaat kaa mausam aate hi chote-chote keede panapana shuru kar dete hai
 During this time there is sufficient moisture in the atmosphere
 nami bharaa maahaul bacteria ke panpane ke liye anukool hota he
 In this case, there is an increased possibility of bacteria growing on the leaves
 in subjiyon ko khaane se pet se judi problem hone kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 2
 zyaadaatar hari subjiyan pani vaale ilaakon main yaa daldali jameen main paidaa hoti hai
 The risk of infection from these vegetables produced in water is very high
 3
 Any vegetable passes through many places before coming to the market
 barsaat main gandagi zyada bad jaati he
 Due to which the possibility of contamination of these vegetables also increases
 4
 Vegetables abound in insects during the rainy season
 aise main inhen khaanaa bimariyon ko nyotaa dene jaisaa hi he
 5
 barsaat ke mausam main aksar subjiyan kharaab ho jaati hai yaa phir unka rang dab jaataa he
 In this case, most of the shopkeepers inject these vegetables and paint them
 ye chemical hamaare liye khatarnaak ho saktaa he

 After Shukla was found guilty of misconduct by an internal inquiry committee, Chief Justice (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi has written a letter to the Prime Minister requesting him to initiate proceedings for his removal
 teen sadasyeey aantarik samiti ne janvari 2018 main paaya tha ki nyaayamurti shukla ke khilaaf shikaayat main paryaapt tathy hai or ye gambhir hai, jo unhen hataane kii kaarywahi shuru karne ke liye paryaapt hai
 The committee consisted of Indira Banerjee, Chief Justice of Madras High Court, Chief Justice of Sikkim High Court S

 Jaiswal was involved
 samiti kii report ke baad tatkaaleen pradhan nyaayadhish deepak mishra ne prakriya ke mutabik nyaayamurti shukla ko salaah di thi ki yaa to vah istipha de den, yaa svaichhik sevanivritti le len
 At the same time, on his refusal to do so, the then CJI asked the Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court to remove him from judicial work with immediate effect after which he allegedly went on long leave
 nyaayamurti shukla ne 23 march ko nyaayamurti gogoi ko patr likh kar ucch nyaayalay main unhen nyaayik kaary karne kii anumati dene kaa aagrah kiya
 The letter was forwarded by the Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court to Justice Gogoi
 nyaayamurti gogoi ne pradhanmantri ko likhe patr main kaha he, ‘‘nyaayamurti shukla ke khilaaf aantarik jaanch samiti ne gambhir aarope paae hai jo unhen hataane kii kaarywahi shuru karne ke liye paryaapt hai, unhen kisi bhi ucch nyaayalay main nyaayik kaary karne kii anumati nahin di ja sakati he
 In these circumstances you are urged to consider further action
 ''ullekhneey he ki sijeai jab kisi ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish ko hataane ke liye raashtrapati or pradhanmantri ko patr likhte hai, tab rajyasabha ke sabhapati sijeai se vichaar-vimarsh kar teen sadasyeey ek jaanch samiti niyukt karte hai
 The committee appointed by the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha examines the evidence and records and gives an opinion as to whether there is a debate in the Upper House to remove them on the basis of them
 nyaayamurti shukla ucch nyaayalay main ek khandpeeth kii adhyakshata kar rahe the, jab unhone sheersh nyaayalay kii sijeai nit peeth ke adeshon kaa kathith ulanghan karte hue nijee collejon ko 2017-18 ke shaikshanik satr main chaatro ko namakan dene kii anumati di
 According to the report of the inquiry committee, Justice Shukla eroded judicial values, did not conduct according to a judge, undermined the dignity, dignity and credibility of his post and violated the oath of office

 According to information received from trusted sources to India Today, Parakh himself went to the Prime Minister after Rao said that the allocation of coal blocks from the auction process would directly affect the electricity rates per unit
 is khulaase se piemo kii un sari koshishon par palitha lag jaataa he jo sabit karnaa chaahati hai ki manmohan singh or koyala ghotaale kaa ek-duusare se kori lenaa-dena nahin he

 nair ne kuch takneekee khamiyaan ginaakar file parakh ko waapas lautaa di thi
 This was the first hurdle on the way to auction
 nair kaa tark tha ki aavanton kaa maujuuda tarika bhale hi kitna bhi manamaana or anuchit kyon na ho, use jari rakhana chahie
 Despite the amendment of the Mines and Minerals (development and Regulation) Act 1957 in Parliament in August 2010, this method continued till 2011
 is kanoon ke lagu hone ke baad sarkaar is baat ke liye baadhya thi ki koyala block oonchi boli lagane vaale ko hi mili
 However, the auction rules were notified by the Coal Ministry in February this year
 parakh 12 hafte ke bheetar ek aisi paardarshee vyavastha lagu karne par ade hue the jo koyala block aavanton kii prakriya ko sahaj bana de
 But one of the people involved with the decision-making process at the time says that it was drowned out by bureaucrats 'in collusion with the leaders'
 disambar, 2005 main naukari se ritair hone se pehle parakh ne pradhanmantri karyaalay ke diggajon ko samajhane kii ek koshish or kii lekin uskaa bhi koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 However, when Parikh was contacted in Hyderabad, he declined to comment
 unhone kaha ki ve apni baat sansad kii lok lekha samiti (piesi) ke saamne hi rakhenge
 However, sources in the Prime Minister's Office have denied the allegation that Nair had raised some questions while returning the file
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ke sutron kaa kahana he, “yah sach he ki raav ne koyala sachiv kii file par kai sawaal uthaae the
 One of those arguments was also that the auction of coal blocks would cause a huge increase in electricity rates
 koyala rajyamantri ne sitambar, 2004 main nilaamee se sambandhit parakh ke vichaaron or apane virdohi vichaaron ko shaamil karte hue pradhanmantri karyaalay ko ek note bheja tha, haalanki note par unke dastakhat nahin the
 The Prime Minister's Office sent it to the Coal Secretary after reading it
 ” parakh apane prayaason par date rahe or unhone 25 sitambar, 2004 ko raav ke paas ek cabinet note kaa masauda bheja
 All the arguments were present in this note which would have dismissed Rao's objections

 inputah bhashaa Recently, the confidence of party supremo Vindh Kejriwal on Ashutosh and Ashish Khaitan, who had left the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), had started to wane, at least on the basis of the tweet and retweet made by them
 party pramukh kii ore se apni party ke anya bade netaaon ke twit or retweats ke aadhaar par lagata he ki arvind kejariwal ne dhire-dhire ashutosh or ashish khetaan ko nazarandaaj karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Ashutosh and Ashish Khaitan are both former journalists
 donon ne aam aadmi party main shaamil hone ke saath hi apane raajnneetik kariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Both the journalist-turned-politician's estrangement from the party's top leadership and Kejriwal's timeline on Twitter showed that his stature had begun to decline in the party
 kejariwal ne pehle hi chhod diya saath!unke party chhodane se pehle aisa lagata he ki party main unki ahmiyat khatm ho rahi thi, sheersh netritv un par vishwaas nahin kar rahaa tha
 If analyzed on Chief Minister Kejriwal's Twitter account in the last 2 months, the situation becomes clear
 18 june se 15 agast tak kejariwal ne ashutosh ke twits ko sirf 2 baar jabaki ashish khetaan ke twits ko 3 baar retweet kiya
 This is much less than the other party leaders and it also shows that in the eyes of the party chief, the importance of these two leaders had diminished
 twitor par kejariwal ke 1
 There are 4 crore followers and in terms of followers, he is the second most popular Indian politician on social media after Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 party se jude sutron ke anusaar, party pramukh ne pehle se hi soshal media par unhen ignor karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 During the same period, Kejriwal retweeted 102 tweets of his party workers, including Manish Sisodia, who holds the No
 2 position in the Delhi government, while 80 tweets from journalists and 11 tweets from leaders of other parties
 unke twitor acount par research karne par yah jaankaree saamne ai ki unhone 31 baar sitaudiya jabaki 19 baar party kii dilli shakha ke pramukh pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ke twit ke retweet kiya tha
 This is what happened with Vishwas! Kejriwal is constantly active on social media and also operates his Twitter account himself, as well as giving directions to the social media team
 party se jude sutron ke anusaar, kejariwal or party ke vidrohi netaa kumaar vishwaas ke bich rishte talkh hone ke baad party pramukh ne unke saath bhi aisa hi suluk kiya or unke twits ko retweet karnaa band kar diya tha
 Although Ashutosh and Ashish Khaitan are believed to have resigned from the party on August 15, this was revealed earlier this week
 kejariwal ko abhi unke istife par faisla lenaa he
 When Ashutosh announced to leave the party on August 15, Kejriwal replied, "how can we accept your resignation, Sir?" Not in this birth
 sar ham sabhiapako pyaar karte hai
 'at one time Ashutosh used to be very close to Kejriwal and Ashutosh was used behind the scenes to persuade rebel leaders other than many mlas
 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav se pehle party main unki acchhee khaasi ahmiyat thi
 During the feud with Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan Kejriwal, the party used Ashish Khaitan and Ashutosh as key negotiators to resolve the matter
 party se jude sutron ke anusaar, party ke kai varisht netaaon main manmutav tab se dikh rahaa he jabase party ne rajyasabha seat ke liye varisht netaa sanjay singh ke alaava bijnesaman susheel gupta or charted acountint endi gupta ko namankit kiya
 Displeased with the ticket being cut, sources say that Ashutosh, Ashish Khaitan and the founding member of the party, Kumar Vishwas were very angry with the AAP leadership during the Rajya Sabha elections
 saath hi party ne 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye chandani chowk se ashutosh kii jagah pankaj gupta ko ummidavaar bana diya
 While Ashutosh lost the Lok Sabha elections from here in the 2014 elections
 duusari ore, ashish khetaan bhi is baat se naaraaz chal rahe the ki party aagaamee chunaav main unako nai dilli loksabhaa seat se tikat nahin de rahi he
 Khaitan contested from here in 2014 and lost

 The resentment of NDA publicity, which seemed overwhelming in Mumbai, did not show the people of Asaram Maharashtra elected their representatives for the 288-member assembly
 somvaar ko matdaan sampann hone ke baad agsit pole aae, jinamein pradesh main ek baar phiradevendra fadanaviski sarkaar banati najar aa rahi he
 Amidst signs of withdrawal of Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena's National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to power in Maharashtra, the question is also who is the king of Mumbai and konkan-thane? This question is also because some time ago, due to the cutting of trees, it came under discussion in the same area
 shivasena kaa garh maane jane vaale konkan kshetra main sarkaar se naaraazgi thi
 The PMC bank scam in Mumbai, once a Congress stronghold, was also affected
 in sabake bich agsit pole ke anumaan yadi nateezon main tabdeel hote hai to janata ne ek sur se endie ko king bataaya he
 NDA Kommumbai has a total of 36 assembly seats in Mumbai, out of 36 seats
 india today-exis maai india agsit pole ke anumaanon ke anusaar in 36 main se 30 sitenendieke hisse main aati dikh rahi hai
 At the same time, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) seems to be limited to just three seats
 anya ko bhi teen siten mil sakati hai
 In konkan-thane, NDA got 29 seats, UPA 6 seats, konkan-thane area also got a strong fight during the election campaign between the ruling BJP and the opposition alliance
 is kshetra main kul 39 siten hai
 The exit poll results have predicted 29 seats for the ruling NDA and 6 for the opposition UPA
 chaar siten anya ke khate main jaati dikh rahi hai
 Who got the number of seats in 2014? If you look at the results of the last election of 2014, only BJP and Shiv Sena were overwhelming in these areas
 mumbai kshetra kii 36 main se 15 sitembijepiur shivasena ne 14 siten jiti thim
 The Congress was reduced to five seats, while its ally Sharad Pawar's NCP failed to open an account
 anya ke khate main do siten gai thi
 Shiv Sena won 14 of the 39 seats in the konkan-thane region, BJP 10 seats

 Sushma Swaraj is a well-known name in Indian politics, among the few leaders who make a mark in the country's politics apart from her eloquence and work skills
 sabase kam umr kii adhyaksh, sabase kam umr kii mantri kaa record lambey samay tak apane naam rakhane vaali sushamaa swaraj modi mantrimandal main shaamil nahin huin
 After this, the discussion has started in the political corridors that what will be the role of Sushma Swaraj now, is it not that she has retired from politics after a long journey of more than 40 years? The organizational capacity can be gauged from the fact that at the very young age of 27, in 1979, he was made the state president of Haryana by the Janata Party
 sushamaa ne disambar main hi 2019 kaa chunaav nahin ladane kaa elaan kar diya tha
 Now that he has not been included in the Modi cabinet, there is a question about his role
 swasthya kaarnon kaa hawala dekar pehle hi loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladiin
 Now she did not even join the cabinet
 kuch netaaon ko jinhen mantrimandal main shaamil nahin kiya gaya unke bare main kaha ja rahaa ki vah sanghathan main ahm bhoomika adaa karenge
 There is little scope to enter Sushma Swaraj's organization
 kyonki vah pehle hi swasthy kaarnon kaa hawala dekar loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladi
 His second role could have been that of Lok Sabha Speaker, but now it cannot be the same
 kyonki is baar vah loksabhaa chunaav ladi hi nahin
 Now such speculations are being made about his political future
 modi se naaraazgi kii bhi hoti he charchasushamaa swaraj un netaaon main shaamil hai, jinke saamne modi kaa udai hua
 Sushma is also credited for the close association with Muslim countries in the Modi government
 indira gandhi ke baad desh kii duusari mahila videsh mantri sushamaa kaa kaarykaal duniya bhar main bharatiyon kii madad ke liye hameshaa uplabdh rahane vaali netaa ke taur par he
 Apart from these, there has also been talk of Sushma's displeasure with Modi in political circles
 twitor par jahaan bhaajapa netaaon ke liye piem modi ko follow karnaa anivaary sa he, sushamaa swaraj unhen bhi follow nahin karatin
 Even his announcement of not contesting the election, the politicians know the reason for ignoring the senior leaders
 balakot par bayaan se sarkaar ko kiya tha asahjaloksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan tatkaaleen videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne balakot air strike par apane bayaan se bhi modi sarkaar ko asahaj kiya tha
 Swaraj had said among the activists that during the air strike, the government had instructed the Air Force that the Pakistani Army should not be scratched during the entire operation nor should any Pakistani citizen be killed
 ahmedabad main sushamaa ne kaha tha ki 26 farvari ko hui air strike main kisi pakistani naagarik or sainik ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaa tha
 Karnataka Assembly by-election to be held on December 5 Election results will be announced on December 11, Election Commission has extended the date for the Karnataka assembly elections by-elections
 chunaav ayog ne kaha he ki 15 vidhansabha siton ke liye up chunaav 5 disambar ko karaae jaaenge, vahiin 11 disambar ko chunaav ke nattejey aaenge
 According to the information given by the commission, voting will be held from 7 am to 6 pm
 matganana 9 disambar se shuru ho jaaegi
 The new dates have been announced by the Election Commission, when the Election Commission said that the results of the election will not be declared until the disqualification of mlas is being heard in the Supreme Court
 darasal karnataka vidhayakon ke ayogy tehraae jane par chal rahi supreme court main sunwaayee ke dauraan chunaav ayog ne sabhi 15 siton par upachunaav taalane kii baat kahi thi
 The Election Commission said on Thursday that the Karnataka by-election is postponed until the Supreme Court gives its verdict on the disqualified mlas
 supreme court main vidhayakon ke ayogy tehraae jane ke maamle kii ab sunwaayee 22 oktober ko hogi
 Let us know that 17 disqualified mlas applied in the Supreme Court to be allowed to contest the by-elections
 vidhayakon ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki ham somvaar se hi is cese ke liye lard rahe hai
 The Supreme Court said on this that we must first get to the bottom of this case, only then a decision can be given on it
 vahiin chunaav ayog ne kaha ki chunaav taal die gaye hai
 Indian tennis star Sania Mirza has said that this year has been very good for her so far
 sania ne ummid jataai ki kazakhstan kii apni nai jodidar yaroslava shevedova ke saath milakar mahila yugal main aage bhi behatar pradarshan jari rakhengi
 Sania's pairing with Czech Republic's Barbara Strycova ended a couple of weeks ago due to their separation
 strikova ke saath unki jodi das toornament tak chali
 Earlier, the Indian had a successful pairing with Swiss star Martina Hingis
 sania ne kaha, ‘is saal meri shuruyaat bahut acchhee rahi he
 i have played in a Grand Slam final (australian Open mixed doubles)
 ek khitaab (brisben) jeet chuki hai or kuch toornament ke final (miami or sidney) main pahunchi hum
 Also made it to the semi-finals several times
 main apni sabase badi aalochak hum or hameshaa sochati hum ki main isse behatar pradarshan kar sakati thi
 Comments shevedova ke saath jodi banane ko lekar sania ne kaha, ‘main use kaaphi pehle se jaanati hum
 She is an excellent player and has won the Grand Slam title
 ummid he ki hamen talmail bithaane main zyada samay nahin lagegaa
 She is a very strong player and plays on the backhand side of the court
 court par ham apni bhagidaari kaa lutf uthaaenge or acha parinaam bhi hasil karenge
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) His pairing with Strycova lasted ten tournaments
 isse pehle is bhartiya ne swiss star martina hingis ke saath safal jodi banaai thi
 Sania said, 'this year i have had a great start
 main ek grandslam final (australian open mishrit yugal) main khel chuki hum
 Has won one title (brisbane) and reached the finals of some tournaments (miami and Sydney)
 iske alaava kai baar semifinal main bhi jagah banaai
 i am my biggest critic and always think that i could have done better
 ’tippaniyan On pairing up with Shevedova, Sania said, 'I know her long back
 vah behtareen khilaadi he or grandslam khitaab jeet chuki he
 Hopefully, we will not take long to adjust

 Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has forbidden his ministers to make anti-india statements so that there is no impediment in the peace process
 navaj ke kareebi ek adhikari ne shuukravaar ko bataaya ki pradhanmantri ne mantriyon or varisht adhikariyon ko koi bhi aisa bayaan nahin dene ke liye kaha he, jisase shanti prakriya main khalal pade
 According to the report of The Nation, optimistic about better relations with India, the official said, "instead of previous things, statements will now be made to carry forward the peace process
" pradhanmantri ne apane sabhi karibiyon or cabinet ke sadasyon ko shanti kaa prachaar karne ke liye kaha he
 The official said that Nawaz is optimistic about better relations with India, which will benefit the entire region considerably
 donon deshon ke bich shanti prakriya par charchpsdhikari ne kaha ki navaj bharat kii ore se is bayaan se kaaphi naakhush the ki vahpakistanke saath charchaa main uske kabje vaale kashmir par hi baatcheet karegaa, lekin pradhanmantri jald hi samaj gaye ki yah bharat sarkaar kii niti nahin he
 According to the official, Nawaz wants Kashmir, terrorism and trade to be given priority when there is a discussion about the peace process between the two countries
 sarkaar or sena ke vichaaron main koi antar nahinek anya adhikari ne kaha ki bharat ke saath shanti ke sandarbh main sena kaa rukh bhi yahi he
 The official said, "there is no difference between the views of the government and the army and both countries believe that no agreement should be reached on the declared position on the main issues

 input- IANS The Election Commission has ordered an inquiry into the tampering of the name of Subhash Chandra, the director of a channel that reached the Rajya Sabha from Haryana's quota
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar subhash chandra kaa naam haryana main hue rajyasabha chunaav main jeet ke parinaam kii list main daalaa gaya tha, lekin baad main yah naam hat gaya
 This not only created confusion but also wondered how this could happen after the results were declared
 sutron ke anusaar subhash chandra kii jeet ko chunaav ayog kii site par bilkul sahi tareeke se daal diya gaya tha
 After his election was questioned, the Election Commission made it clear that once the result is declared, it cannot be changed in any way
 lekin baad main yah paaya gaya ki site se unka naam hat gaya he
 To investigate how this happened, now the Election Commission has ordered an internal inquiry
 chunaav ayog yah pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahaa he ki kahin site hack to nahin ho gai thi, yaa phir kisi bhitari aadmi ne is ghatana ko anjaam diya
 The Election Commission now says that the correct result has once again been put on the website
 bataa den ki haryana main rajyasabha kii donon siton par bijepi ne baaji maar lee
 His candidate and Union Minister Chaudhary Birendra Singh won easily, but the victory of bjp-backed Independent candidate Subhash Chandra was unexpected as the Congress rejected 14 votes
 tippaniyan Despite the decision of the party high command, Congress-backed candidate RK Anand was defeated
 party kaa ek dhada pehle se hi unka virodh kar rahaa tha
 If former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda did not reveal his preference, Randeep Surjewala had declared his vote
 ullekhneey he ki haryana main congress pehle se hi do khemon main banty thi
 The choice of high command was not made by the Hooda camp of Ashok Tanwar
 deshbhar main lagaataar kamjor ho rahi congress ke liye haryana ke nattejey nae sankat kaa aagaaj rahe
 According to information received from the sources, Subhash Chandra's name was listed in the result of victory in the Rajya Sabha election held in Haryana, but later the name was removed
 isse na keval bhram kii sthiti paidaa hui balki yah bhi aashcharya hua ki parinaam ghoshit hone ke baad aisa kaise ho saktaa he
 According to sources, Subhash Chandra's victory was put in the right manner on the Election Commission site
 unke chunaav par sawaal uthaae jane ke baad chunaav ayog ne saaf kar diya tha ki parinaam ghoshit hone ke baad use kisi bhi prakaar se badla nahin ja saktaa he
 But it was later found that his name had been removed from the site
 yah kaise hua, ab isaki jaanch ke liye chunaav ayog ne aantarik jaanch ke aadesh de diya he
 The Election Commission is trying to find out whether the site was hacked, or whether some inner man carried out the incident
 chunaav ayog kaa ab kahana he ki sahi parinaam ek baar phir website par daal diya gaya he

 lagu hone ke do saal baad notebandi paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon main ek bada mudda ban gaya he
 The Congress is constantly attacking the Modi government on this issue, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi is describing demonetisation in every public meeting as a step to curb corruption
 haalanki modi kahin bhi is baat kaa zikr nahin karte ki jab notebandi ke baad takreeban sari karency bainkon main waapas aa gai to bhrashtachar par lagaam kaise laga
 In such a situation, the reticent and soft spoken former Prime Minister, Dr
 manmohan singh ne modi sarkaar ko notebandi or jiesti ke masale par bada hamalaa kiya he
 Dr
 singh ne madhya pradesh ke indore main notebandi or jiesti ko naasamajh or betuke faisle bataate hue ise ‘sarkaar pryojit tex terarysm’ kaa naam diya he or aarope lagaaya ki in faislon ke jariye sarkaar ne sangathit or asangathit kshetron par kadaa prahaar kiya
 He said that small, medium and small scale industries and businesses are on the verge of closure due to the double whammy of demonetisation and GST
 dow
 Singh alleged that the Modi government is busy creating 'a false story everyday' to justify demonetisation
 lekin sachaai yah he ki notebandi modi sarkaar dwaara lagu ek bhayaavah or aitihaasik bhul sabit hui he
 He said that no purpose of demonetisation was accomplished
 na to 3 lakh crores ru

 aatankwaad or naksalwad ko rokane ke daawey bhi khokhale sabit hue
 Dr
 also about Modi government promises and claims about employment and jobs
 manmohan singh ne kadaa prahaar kiya
 He said that data from the Labor Bureau has revealed that only a few thousand jobs were generated every quarter and these figures reveal the false promises of a good day of giving 2 crore jobs
 dow
 Singh asked the government, what was the reason that the government did not release the data of the Labor Bureau in october-december 2017? manmohan singh ne sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa
 He said that Modi's promise to raise the minimum support price to one and a half times the cost has also proved to be a mere jumla
 sach to yah he ki kisaanon ko emspi bhi nahin mil paa rahaa he
 On the other hand, GST on fertilizers, pesticides and agricultural implements has increased the burden on farmers
 dow
 Referring to crop insurance, Singh said that the number of farmers under PMFBY is just 0

 < BJP president Amit Shah has now put his full strength to strengthen his hold in seven states where bjp's hold is not so special
 shah centre main apni party kaa spasht bahumat hone kaa phayda uthaakar is maukey kaa istemaal saaton rajyon main party kii pakad majboot banane ke liye karnaa chaahate hai
 PM Modi's brother has put a mark on the BJP government
 There are seven states - Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana
 party sutron ke mutabik, amit shah yahaan par party ko majboot karne ke liye in rajyon ke bijepi netaaon ke saath pichley kuch dinon se meeting kar rahe hai or aane vaale dinon main bhi baithkon kaa yah silsilaa jari rahane vaala he
 Shah has already met party leaders from Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, Kerala and on this weekend, he will also fight with Telangana and Andhra leaders 
 kerala or pashchim bengal main agle saal vidhansabha chunaav hone hai or bijepi ke kendriya netritv ne rajya ke apane netaaon se congress or left partiyon ke gire hue manobal kaa phayda uthaakar vahaan party kii sthiti majboot karne ke liye kaha he
 According to sources, Shah has asked his local leaders to identify candidates for next year's elections
 shah ne kaha he ki in donon rajyon main party ke baahar ke un ummidavaaron kii suchi bhi banaai jaae, jo bijepi ke tikat par chunaav ladakar siten nikaalane kaa dam rakhte hai
 The BJP is in a mood to contest elections in these states on the issue of good governance of Modi government and the issues of low growth and corruption there
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle bada daanv khelkar apni bahan priyanka gandhi wadra ko raajnneeti main utaara
 He has been made the General Secretary of the party
 wo ab purvi uttar pradesh kii jimmedaari sanbhaalengi
 With this, Rahul has also appointed his most prominent Jyotiraditya Scindia as the General Secretary of the party
 priyanka kii tarah jyotiraditya pashchimi uttar pradesh kii jimmedaari sanbhaalenge
 Now, even though Jyotiraditya has grown up in the party, it is worth noting that he has been taken away from Madhya Pradesh somewhere and that too at a time when the Lok Sabha elections are over his head and his most need is in Madhya Pradesh
 
 yaad dilaa den ki madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main congress kii jeet ke baad jyotiraditya sindhiya ko mukhyamantri banaae jane kaa daawa majboot mana ja rahaa tha, kyonki wo bataur madhya pradesh main rajaneta ke rup main sthapit ho chuke hai or unka sindhiya rajgaraane se taalluk he
 But at the last moment Rahul Gandhi made Kamal Nath the Chief Minister
 raajnneetik jaankaar kehete hai ki jyotiraditya sindhiya ko party nazarandaaj nahin kar rahi he
 They just wait for the right time
 kyonki rahul mauka aane par jyotiraditya ko bada pad denge
 Which he pointed out during the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections in Mandsaur, saying that we have Kamal Nath, who has experience
 lekin ye or bhi acchhee baat he ki jyotiraditya bhi hai jo yuva hai or bhavishya hai
 Distance from Madhya Pradesh
 
 
 lagaataar paanch baar loksabhaa chunaav main jeet or madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko ubhaarne ke baavjood jyotiraditya ko party ne ab jaakar mahasachiv banaaya he, lekin wo madhya pradesh se utane hi dur ho rahe hai
 He has been given the command of western Uttar Pradesh by Rahul
 lekin yadi wo loksabhaa chunaav main madhya pradesh main rahe to congress ke liye behatar ho saktaa he
 If seen, Scindia's dominance in gwalior-chambal, Bundelkhand has been better than before
 lekin samay ke saath yuvaaon ke bich unki lokapriyata badi he
 This can be gauged from the fact that Jyotiraditya held many more rallies in Madhya Pradesh than Kamal Nath and Rahul
 unhone 110 chunavi sabhaaon ko sambodhit kiya saath hi road sho bhi kiye
 Rahul gave a hint of future for Scindia
 
 
 priyanka gandhi or jyotiraditya sindhiya ko mahasachiv banaae jane ke baad rahul ne media se baat karte hue is baat par jor diya ki unhone donon netaaon ko keval do maah ke liye hi uttar pradesh kaa prabhaar nahin diya he
 Rather they have to establish Congress ideology here
 yani ki jyotiraditya kii kaabiliyat par rahul ko puraa bharosa he or bhavishya main unhen bada pad hasil ho saktaa he

 Surbhi Verma, a second-year student of management at IIM-K (indian Institute of Management - Kozhikode), says, "I understood the meaning of diversity in unity at the annual food festival on campus
" desh ke alag-alag hisson ke pakwaanon main jo vividhta he, use kamaal kii kaha ja saktaa he
 Food Festival is a big event in IIM-K calendar
 isaki rasoi se lekar saanskrithik gatividhiyon tak sari chizon kaa management chaatro ke haathon main hi hota he, yahaan tak ki vyanjanon ko pakaana bhi
 It is part of efforts to increase mutual dialogue between teachers and students on campus
 mumbai ke abhishek gupta kehete hai, ''bahut se chaatro ko yah iiem-ke community ke saamne apni pratibha dikhaane kaa manch banataa he
 It also encourages more informal interactions between students, teachers and staff
 ”lekin yah sirf sugandh or swaad kaa jabardast visphot nahin he, jo logon ko food festival or iiem-ke kii ore khinch laata he
 Seeing the green campus of this institute is a great experience in itself, which is surrounded by the lush greenery of the Kerala landscape on a small hill
 dean saji gopinath kehete hai, ''iiem-ke bhartiya samskruti or vichaaron kaa sangam he
 "at IIM-K, students not only learn in their classes, but they also learn a lot from activities besides teaching, such as food festivals and international festivals
 gopinath kehete hai, ''ye festival chaatro ko sangathit hone kaa mauka dete hai, iske alaava unhen events ke prabandhan or marketing kaa mauka bhi miltaa he
 "able Srivastava, a 24-year-old student from Lucknow of Post Graduate Diploma in Management, and his classmate Niranjan Narayanan, 21, from Chennai, agree
 niranjan kehete hai, ''ham in anubhavon se bahut kuch sikhte hai
 This food festival showcases the talent of the students amidst our busy academic programs
 is festival ne hamaari rachanaatmak samvednaaon ko ubhaara or campus main ek nai urja bhar di

 According to Ramnath, the idea behind this is to help students understand how business has progressed through different centuries and how it has remained connected to society
 isse antrapranyor banane ke icchhukon ko bharat kaa samrudh vanijyik itihaas samajhane main madad milegi
 Apart from this, there is also the Center for Research and Education for Social Transformation, which is dedicated to uplift and empower the students of tribal, dalit and other disadvantaged sections
 iiem-ke ne stri-purush samanta ko badhaava dene main bhi nai raah dikhaai he
 This year, 54 percent of all seats in post graduate management courses have been won by women
 yah institute ab ek post-doctoral research centre bana rahaa he, jo desh main shikshakon kii kami ko dur karne ke liye pratibhaaon ko taiyaar karegaa
 Simultaneously, the process of setting up the Center for Environmental Governance is also underway, which will aim to help in solving burning issues related to the environment and research in this regard

 *** agar kisi vyakti kaa vaastavik charitra jaananaa ho to use golf course par dekhie
 On 25 January 2006, Pawan Kumar Bansal resigned as the chairman of the Ethics Committee of the Lok Sabha
 un par aarope tha ki unhone chandigarh golf course kii maanad sadsyta ke liye saansad nidhi se 5 lakh ru
 Have given
 congress ne tab golf khel ke bare main mashhoor dharna par gaur kar ball hole main daal diya hota, to shaayad ‘bansalwad’ itnaa nahin faltaa-phulataa
 But then Bansal had called for a higher moral standard
 “aarope lagane ke baad maine loksabhaa spikar se kah diya he ki main us cameti kaa netritv nahin kar saktaa jo saansadon ke aacharan (oparation duryodhana main sawaal ke badale ghuscand main fanse saansadon kii barkhaastagi) ke bare main jaanch kar rahi he
 "but then Bansal, who tried to set a high standard of morality, did not resign from the post of Railway Minister in the Cash for posting-promotion case until the CBI inquiry reached Bansal's door and Congress was at the mouth Soot did not get burnt
 in 6-7 saal main bansal vitt rajyamantri se sansadeey kaarymantri, jal sansaadhan mantri, vigyaan-praudyogiki mantri ke raste rail mantralay jaise malaaidaar mahakme ke mukhiya bane or gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki yahi daur tha jab bansal ke parivaar se judi companiyon ke turnover shunya se saikadon karod rupye tak pahunch gaye
 If the director general of RPF, Ranjit Sinha (now CBI director) and Mahesh Kumar, a suspended and jailed railway board officer, did not have a mutual grudge, perhaps the raw letter from the Bansal family would not have come before the country
 bhartiya puranic kathaon kii tarah yahaan bhi mamaa or bhaanje kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 With 43-year-old Vijay Singla taking the right steps, Lutyens headed to his maternal uncle's posh office on the second floor of Rail Bhavan in Delhi that he was stopped by security personnel on duty
 ve unase us ‘gulabi pravesh patr’ kii maang karte hai jise dikhaane ke baad visitors ko mantriyon ke chembar tak jane kii anumati milti he
 They get caught up in the debate, when Bansal's OSD (special Officer) Vitul Kumar comes out and tells the adamant policeman that Singla is a relative of the minister, so he is a special guest
 yah nanvabar, 2012 ke november kii ghatana thi
 Pawan Kumar Bansal took over as Railway Minister on 28 October
 3 may, 2013 ko sibiai ne vijay ko kathith taur par mahesh kumaar ko railway board main member (electric) kaa pad dilaane ke liye rishwat lete range haathon giraftaar kiya
 When the finger arose towards Bansal, he defended himself by pleading that Siganla would not have a business relationship
 lekin sibiai ko is baat ke saboot milane lage ki bansal kii bhi isamen bhoomika ho sakati he
 CBI is investigating who got the money? However, it is clear that Bansal is a 'family who values' people
 uttar pradesh cader ke ipies adhikari vitul kumaar bhi unke ek rishtedaar hi hai jinhen railway chalaane kii apni jimmedaari nibhaane main madad karne ke liye unhone chunaa tha
 He is the son-in-law of Bansal's elder sister who has been posted with Bansal since 2011
 vitul kumaar ke bade bhai jagadeep goyal ne bhi 2009 main sansadeey kaary mantralay main bansal ke oesady ke rup main apni sevaayen di thim
 Bhanja Singla had quickly established her dominance in Rail Bhavan so that no one had any difficulty in hitting
 vah aksar vitul kumaar yaa bansal ke nijee sachiv rahul bhandari ke saath najar aate jo punjab cader ke iees adhikari hai or june, 2007 se mantri ji ke saath hai
 Senior railway officials say that Bansal had allowed Vijay to sit in important meetings with railway officials in his office
 ek adhikari ne hairaani jataate hue bataaya ki ‘singla mantri ke kamare main baithkar filon ko aise ulatate-palatate rahete maano ve koi gocip magazine hon
 Once Vijay was accompanied by another close relative and a chartered accountant
 is rail adhikari kaa kahana he, “mantri ji apane karyaalay main unki maujuudagi se kabhi asahaj nahin dikhe
 “everyone in the Ministry of Railways felt that the nephew of the minister had retained an undefined control over the affairs of Rail Bhavan
 ek anya adhikari kaa kahana he, “yah katai mumkin nahin ki bansal ko nahin pataa ho ki unki naak ke neeche kya ho rahaa he
 "the clarification of Bansal and Congress that it has nothing to do with the nephew
" lekin yah bhi tathy he ki 90 lakh ru
 Giver Mahesh Kumar found the post he wanted

 In Bansal's native city and constituency Chandigarh, some people are surprised that CBI arrested Vijay on 3 May
 shahar ke ek varisht congressi kehete hai, “mujhe ek baat khatkati he ki yah pehle kyon nahin hua?” unhone us kahani kii misaal di jisamen ‘raja ke praan tote main hote hai
 Vijay is the same parrot
 ” 1996 main pehali baar apane mamaa ke chunaav abhiyaan main singla ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi or jald hi vah mamaa kaa chunaav fund manager ban gaya
 a Congress leader, who has consistently opposed Bansal, claims that Vijay has become a king from the ranks today, by fortifying his maternal uncle with the rising political sun
 ve kehete hai, “sirf 15 saal pehle, yah vyakti panchakula ke sector 8 main ek kiraye ke makaan main rahata tha
 Today, his palatial house is just a short distance from Bansal's house in Chandigarh
 ”railway main cash for post ghotaale kii jaanch kar rahe sibiai ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki mahesh kumaar ko singla kaa rasookh maaloom tha, isliye ve railway board ke sadsy (electric) kaa pad hasil karne ke liye 10 karod ru
 Was ready to take it out of his pocket
 unhone vijay ko bansal ke saath or unke karyaalay main bhi aksar dekha tha
 The CBI officer claims, "he was sitting there, broking deals and selling transfers and appointments in railways
" ” mana ja rahaa he ki sibiai ke paas giraftaar board member mahesh kumaar or vijay kii bansal ke dilli main 6, ashok road ke aadhikarik nivas par hui mulaakaat ke saboot maujuud hai
 CBI interrogated Bansal's private secretary Bhandari for two days
 jiske baad sibiai ne bansal se bhi poochtacha kaa man banaaya
 But Vijay's growth in real estate business has astonished everyone

 But Bansal's wife says that the allegations are being thrown out as a conspiracy to defame her husband
 madhu bansal ne talkhi se kaha tha, “vah (vijay singla) kya karata he uske liye ham jimmedaar nahin hai
 "the family tried to use social networking to wash off the ink on them: Vikram Bansal, who normally handles his uncle's public relations, posted on Facebook," Satyapal Jain talks about my wealth and wealth Doing, but i wonder how a newspaper seller can buy a house of two kanals in Chandigarh? ”but on May 8, even more trouble arose Ri was questioned reports that Manish Bansal may be mentioned how as a senior law officer, Additional Advocate General, Haryana, while they are actively engaged in their businesses

 a post shared by Salman Khan (@beingsalmankhan) on Aug 12, 2018 at 12:29am PDTA post shared by ali (@aliabbaszafar) on Jul 31, 2018 at 10:47pm PDT India's non-playing captain Mahesh Bhupathi has said that he will see Leander Paes in training before deciding on the team combination in the Davis Cup match against Uzbekistan within two days
 unhone yahaan bharat ke training satr se pehle patrakaron se kaha, ‘team par faisla abhi nahin hua he
 i saw Leander in training for the first time today
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 However, Bhupathi said that Paes looked good
 unhone kaha, ‘vah tarotaaja dikh rahaa tha
 that was nice
 vah kuch set khelegaa, phir dekhenge
 Bhupathi said the situation was similar in Mexico, where Paes has recently won the Challenger Trophy
 unhone kaha, ‘‘haa, isse liender ko nishchit rup se madad milegi, jo mexico main samaan halaat main khele the
 Bhupathi said that the absence of Uzbekistan's Dennis Istomin and Yuki Bhambri has been equaled
 unhone kaha, ‘pichley do din se ham sun rahe the ki istomin nahin aayega
 For us, losing Yuki is a big setback, but the exit of Istomin has been equaled
 ’ yah poochne par ki kya in donon ke baahar hone se mukaable kii dilchaspee kam ho gai to bhupati ne kaha ki saat april ko muqabla shuru hone ke baad pataa chal jaayegaa
 Bhupathi said, 'the Indian team is playing
 main nahin jaanata ki yuki kaa khelnaa aakarshan tha yaa bharat bangalore main khel rahaa he, yah aakarshan jab khilaadi shuukravaar ko khelenge, tabhi pataa chalegaa
 He said that Yuki's absence is a great opportunity for young players to impress
 tippaniyan He said, 'you don't get so many opportunities
 agar ve acha pradarshan karte hai or yuki or saket mineni feet hokar court par vaapasi karte hai to ve unke saath daud main shaamil ho sakate hai
 He said that captaining the Davis Cup team is a different situation as he has played matches not only with or against Indian players but also with and against rivals
 bhupati ne kaha, ‘meri sthiti yahaan ajeeb si he
 All these players are my partners
 main in sabhi ke saath or khilaaf khelaa hum, jisamen denis (istomin) bhi shaamil hai
 We both played doubles together
 isaliye ve bhi mere dost hai
 It is exciting for me to be the captain and they are also enjoying it
 ’(is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) He said, 'for the last two days we were hearing that Istomin would not come
 hamaare liye, yuki ko ganvaana bada jhatka he lekin istomin ke baahar hone se muqabla barabari kaa ho gaya he
 When asked if the exit of these two has reduced the interest of the contest, Bhupathi said that it will be known after the match starts on April 7
 bhupati ne kaha, ‘bhartiya team khel rahi he
 i do not know if Yuki was playing or India is playing in Bangalore, this attraction will be known only when the players play on Friday
 ’ unhone kaha ki yuki kii anupasthiti yuva khilaadiyon ke paas prabhavit karne kaa badhiya mauka he
 The comments unhone kaha, ‘aapako itane maukey nahin milte
 If they do well and Yuki and Saket Myneni come back on the court with a fit, they can join the race with them
 ’ unhone kaha ki davis cap team kii captaini karnaa alag si sthiti he kyonki unhone sirf bhartiya khilaadiyon ke saath yaa khilaaf hi nahin balki pratidwandviyon ke saath or khilaaf bhi match khele hai
 Bhupathi said, 'my situation is strange here
 ye sabhi khilaadi mere saathi hai
 i have played with and against all of these, including Dennis (istomin)
 ham donon saath main yugal khele
 That is why they are also my friends
 mere liye captain bananaa romaanchak he or ve bhi iskaa lutf uthaa rahe hai

 dilli uniwarsity main bi-tech padhane vaale hajaaron chaatro kaa bhavishya khatare main he

 In fact, during the Four Year Undergraduate Program (FYUP) in 2013-14, the bsc program in DU was given a b-tekka status, which was to be approved by AICTE, but the FYU program was rolled back a year later
 haalankibi-tech kii degree ko manyatadene kaa faisla kiya gaya, lekin AICTE kii manyata ke bagaiyr koi bhi technical course maanya nahin hota
 Therefore colleges in AU applied for AICTE accreditation
 affidavid ke mutabik bi-tech corces main namakan ke liye AICTE niyamon kaa paalan kiya gaya ho matlab entress test ke jariye admician liya gaya ho, lekin diu ke 2013-14 ke chaar saal ke paathyakram main cat-of ke aadhaar par admician mila

tech courses also meets the standards of AICTE, meaning that it is mandatory for teachers to have b
tech m
tech
 lekin diu ke kai collejon main beatech padhaane vaale professor piechdi, postagraduate yaa scollar he
 Many DU colleges also do not meet AICTE standards in terms of infrastructure and lab facilities
 epaviupi ke tahat computer science, electronics, food technology, instrumentation electronics or palimur science main beatech course pesh kiya gaya tha jise ujisi ke hastkshep ke baad pichley saal radd kar diya gaya tha
 The UGC, however, instructed DU to continue these five btech courses for the sake of 6000 students taking admission in the 2013-14 academic session only
 collejon se eisitii se manjuuri lene ko kaha gasa tha jo desh main takneekee shiksha kaa niyaman karne ke sambandh main sheersh salaahkaar nikaay he

 apni videshi funding par pabandi lagane ke baad enjio greenpis ne sarkaar par sidhaa hamalaa karte hue kaha he ki centre sarkaar badale kii bhaavana se kaam kar rahi he
 Divya Raghunandan of Green Peace accused the Central Government on Friday, saying, 'we are facing punishment for asking tough questions
 ye hamalaa greenpis par hi nahin, un saare sanghathanon par he, jo jangalon, adivaasiyon or daliton ko bachaane ke liye awaz buland kar rahe hai
 Significantly, last month itself, the High Court quashed the government's order, calling the ban on Greenpeace activist Priya Pillai going abroad as unconstitutional
 uske baad sarkaar kaa greenpis kii videshi funding par roak lagane kaa aadesh ek pratikriyaavaadi kadam ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 But the question is also whether there exists a legal framework in this country for ngos to work in a professional, independent and transparent manner? Harsh Jaitley of Vani, a group that advises NGO organizations, says, 'the relationship between ngos and government today is the same as it was between the government and industries twenty years ago
 ek avishvaas kaa
 The NGO feels that the government is behind it and the government feels that the NGO is behind it
 'aaj kii sachai yah he ki enjio sanghathanon ke liye koi kanoon yaa niyam nahin hai, jo paardarshee hon or jo unhen peshewar tareeke se chalane ke liye baadhya karen
 The truth is that the law of registration of ngos is only one and a half hundred years old
 aaj iskar niyam enjio ko milane vaale paise par lagu nahin hote
 That is, these ngos do not have to pay any tax on their profits
 jaankaar kehete hai ki jahaan corporate jagat par funding or iskar ke niyam saaf hai, vahiin enjio ko lekar kuch bhi saaf nahin he
 For example, the law that applies to foreign funding for the industry was changed to 'FEMA' and reformed to 'FEMA', but the FCRA is a law in the seventies governing ngos, which is basically a law related to national security
 And it is still running
 haalanki isamen bich-bich main badlaav hue hai, lekin ise ek sampurna or swasth kanoon banane ke liye isamen badlaav kii kaaphi gunjaaish he
 There is a special corporate affairs ministry for the corporate world to deal with the Ministry of Finance as well as industries only, but all ngos are still under the Ministry of Home Affairs
 corporate kshetra ke niyam kanoon ke liye kai kanoonee sudhaar hue hai, jabaki enjio kshetra ke liye koi riform nahin kiya gaya
 Harsh Jaitley says that we have given many presentations to the Ministry of Home Affairs and are doing many workshops continuously, so that the government knows our problems and the people of ngos are aware of the rule law
 jetali kehete hai, 'ab aap dekhie ki sarkaar ne enjio ke liye har paanch saal main phir se register karaane kaa niyam bana liya, lekin kai enjio ko is bare main pataa hi nahin he, kyonki sarkaar ne koi notification is bare main jari nahin kiya he
 'actually the ngo's network is quite spread and complicated
 rajanetaaon or enjio sector kaa rishta bhi kaaphi gaharaa he
 Ritwik Dutta, an environmental expert and lawyer, is aggressive and blames the government for not having clear rules in the NGO sector
 'sarkaar unheen enjio ke khilaaf awaz uthaa rahi he, jo jal, jangal auki zamin ko bachaane main lage hai
 Are not FICCI, CII and RSS ngos? Don't many leaders run ngos? ' Dutta asks
 vah kehete hai, '99 fisadi enjio ke paas videshi funding nahin hai or jinke paas videshi paisa aa rahaa he vah bahut kam he
 Despite this, the government is busy suppressing any voice
 videshi companiyaan baahar se aakar agar mining kar sakati hai to phir videshi paise se ham apane jangalon ko bachaane main madad kyon nahin le sakate
 Jaitley says, 'no one knows how many ngos are there in the country
 koi dedh karod kah detaa he or koi dhai karod or jab aap sachai kaa pataa lagaao ko kuch or hi pataa chalata he
 Because of not regulating ngos, whether corporate hospitals, be it big schools or clubs, all have come to ngos
 isliye ham kehete hai ki enjio ke kanoon puraane ho chuke hai auki hamane sarkaar ko kai baar likhaa he, lekin kuch hota nahin he

 The country is neither going forward nor backward

 "modi said" when we will make voting compulsory, voters will become important and political parties will have to pay attention to their concerns
 ’’ Two years ago, when i did prime time for several consecutive days on the loot of private schools, people stopped in the way and said that you are doing this in opposition to Modi

 So the struggling parents are happy to share youtube recording of anonymous channels
 jin channelon ko nami maanate hai un par unki vyathaa nahin he or na hogi kabhi
 With the exception of har saal kuch abhibhavak sangharsh karte hai
 The rest of the guardians continue their slavery

 But the story of the parents who have taken the path of struggle is interesting

 IANS se input Advocate for the Muslim parties in the Ayodhya case, Rajiv Dhawan, has claimed that the Muslim side has removed him from lobbying the case
 rajeev dhawan ne khud fasebuk post ke zarie ye khulaasa kiya he
 Dhawan wrote that i have been dropped from the case because my health is not good
 lekin darasal aisa kuch nahin he
 This is the absolute absurd reason
 jamiyat ko ye adhikaar he ki wo mujhe cese se hataa den, lekin vajah to sahi bataaen
 Jamiat's argument is wrong

 Dhawan has worked hard on behalf of Muslim parties in this case
 unhone is cese ke liye apana dil or aatma lagaai he
 So even if Jamiat has removed him from the case
 lekin duusare pakshakaar unhen hi bataur vakil chaahate hai
