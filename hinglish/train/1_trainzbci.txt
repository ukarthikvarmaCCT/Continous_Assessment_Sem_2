 The close of the union says that industrialist Ratan Tata is leading the list of potential names from NDA
 aresas ke sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat ne spasht kar diya ki ve katai raashtrapati nahin banane vaale
 Mohan Bhagwat made his intention clear while addressing the Veterinary doctors in Nagpur on Wednesday
 gyaat ho ki bhagwat khud waiternari doctor hai
 He started his speech by denying the news of himself becoming President
 unhone kaha ki, ''media main jo khabar he vah to hone se rahaa
 After coming to the Sangh (RSS), we close the doors of all these possibilities
 upar (kendriya str par) bhi kai swayamsevak hai

 On this basis, Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut had also described Mohan Bhagwat as a strong nationalist and a better option for the presidency
 iske baad sarasanghachaalak ne apana rukh saaf kar diya
 Amidst this development, some more names are being discussed by the NDA alliance as the next president
 sutron kii maane to is bahes main maujuuda sthiti main udyogpati or tata samooh ke sarvesarva ratan tata kaa naam aage he
 The Sangh Parivar's view on this name is positive as well as the BJP hopes that the NDA and the opposition will easily agree on this name
 endie ke liye maujuuda sthiti main is saal ke july maheene ke ant main hone vaale raashtrapati kaa chunaav jeetna tedi kheer he
 Because even if it has more votes in the states, it is weaker in the strength of both houses of parliament than the opposition

 Master blaster Sachin Tendulkar may have retired from cricket, but has not stopped 'batting' for the players
 ve chaahate hai ki rozi kii phikr kisi khilaadi kaa hunar na chhinen
 Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar is also concerned about the job of the players and he has raised his voice for the job security of the players
 sachin ne maang kii he ki bahurashtriya companiyaan khilaadiyon ko naukari dena shuru karen
 The occasion was the final of the 69th Police Invitation Shield of Mumbai Police Gymkhana, which was won by Karnataka Sporting Association beating MIG Cricket Club
 is maukey par sachin ne kaha, 'pehle anubandhit khilaadi kam the, khilaadiyon ke paas naukari kii suraksha thi jo aaj nahin he
 First players did not have to think about other things
 ve puraa dhyaan khel par lagaate the
 Job concerns affect players' performance
 isaliye main sabhi bahurashtriya companiyon se apil karuunga ki ve khilaadiyon ko naukari dena shuru karen, unka samarthan karen unhen suraksha den
 Comments mumbai main skool lig main ab 14 khilaadi khel rahe hai
 This idea was also of the 'master blaster'
 iske peeche kaa makasad khilaadiyon ko adhik maukey dena tha
 He said, 'it came a little late, but not coming
 
 
 mere khyaal se inter skool main kariyar 48 maheene kaa hota he 
 
 
 In which pitch conditions are important
 isaliye main chahta tha ki zyada khilaadiyon ko mauka mili
 ' gauratlab he ki pehle khilaadiyon ko sarkari naukari bhi mil jaati thi, lekin badhati aabaadi or ghatati naukariyon ke bich ye aankada ghatata gaya
 Now Asra is from private companies
 vaise khel mantralay ne prastaav diya he ki olympic, asian khelon yaa world championships main tamgaa jeetne waalon ko sidhe class 'e' or 'bi' kii naukari bhi mili, pehle sports kota ke tahat ye naukariyaan nahin milti thim
 Sachin is requested from private companies, but given his stature, it is possible that everyone should keep a positive attitude towards the job of players
 mauka tha mumbai police gymkhana ke 69wein police aamantran shield ke final kaa, jise karnataka sporting association ne emayeeji cricket club ko haraakar jeeta
 On this occasion, Sachin said, 'the players who were previously contracted were few, the players had job security which is not there today
 pehle khilaadiyon ko duusari chizon ke bare main sochane kii zarurat nahin thi
 He used to pay full attention to the game
 naukari kii chintaa khilaadiyon ke pradarshan par asar daalati he 
 That is why i will appeal to all the multinational companies to start giving jobs to the players, support them and give them security
 'tippaniyan There are now 14 players playing in the school league in Mumbai
 yah idia bhi 'master blaster kaa tha
 The motive behind this was to give more opportunities to the players
 unhone kaha, 'ye thodaa der se aayaa, lekin na aane se thik he 
 
 
 i think a career in inter school is 48 months
 
 
 jisamen pich condishans ahm hoti hai
 That's why i wanted more players to get a chance
 ' Significantly, earlier players used to get government jobs as well, but this figure kept decreasing in the midst of increasing population and decreasing jobs
 ab aasraa nijee companiyon se he
 As such, the Sports Ministry has proposed that those who win the Olympic, Asian Games or World Championships get direct 'A' and 'B' jobs, earlier these sports were not available under the sports quota
 sachin kii guzarish nijee companiyon se he lekin unke kad ko dekhte hue ho saktaa he khilaadiyon kii naukari ko lekar sakaaratmak ruukh sab rakhen

 samaajawaadee secular morcha ke gathan ne baadashivpal yadavane aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ke liye taiyaariyaan shuru kar di hai
 Shivpal Yadav and his colleagues have started placing posters, banners and hoardings in different cities of the state
 hordings main baqayda shivpal yadav ko nayaa morcha banane ke liye badhai di gai he
 According to sources, Shivpal Yadav has come up to give a tough fight to his nephew and Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 isse tay he ki loksabhaa chunaav main akhilesh yadav ke liye congress, basapa or bhaajapa ke saath khud ke ghar main bhi badi chunauti hogi, or usase paar paanaa unke liye itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 The reason is clear that Shivpal Yadav has given nearly 40 years with Mulayam Singh Yadav to make Samajwadi Party stand
 party se nishkasit kiye jane ke baad shivpal yadav ne akhilesh yadav ke haathon kaaphi apmaan saha he jisase party kaa ek bada dhada naaraaz he
 Now in 2019 elections Shivpal Yadav will try to avenge that insult and this will be the biggest challenge for Akhilesh Yadav
 kyonki party kaa ek bada cader shivpal yadav ke saath bhi he jo sidhe sapa main send lagayegaa
 Earlier, Mulayam Singh Yadav tried his best to convince Shivpal Yadav, but he did not succeed
 shivpal yadav ne bhi saaf taur par kaha ki vah kareeb dedh saal tak intjaar karne ke baad thak chuke hai or ab vah apmaan nahin sahanaa chaahate
 The result is clear that in the coming 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Samajwadi Party and Samajwadi Secular Front will be face to face

 Jethmalani, who attended the provincial session of the Samajwadi Sindhi Samaj, said that he had also been instrumental in making Modi the Prime Minister, as he had promised to bring back the money deposited in foreign banks to India during the Lok Sabha election campaign
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri banane ke badamodi kalaadhan waapas nahin laae, jisaki unhen kaaphi pidaa he
 Now it seems that Modi will not fulfill his promise
 'desh kaa bhavishya hai akhilesh yadav'purv kendriya kanoon mantri ne kaha, 'main apane aapako thaga hua mahasoos karata hum or khud ko gunahagaar maanata hum ki maine modi kii madad kii
 i have also come among you to say that you people do not trust the words of the Prime Minister

 He told the police that the child in his womb belonged to his father
 police ne aaropee pita ko giraftaar kar liya he
 The 19-year-old girl, who hails from Makarpura area of vadodara, said that her father has been raping her since she was 14 years old
 haivaan pita ne peedita ko munh kholane par jaan se maarane kii dhamkee di thi
 The victim's mother was completely unaware of this
 do din pehle bhi aaropee pita ne apni beti ke saath rape kiya tha
 During that time, he told his father about stomach ache
 havas kii aag main andhe ho chuke pita ne use doctor ke paas jane ko kaha
 After the victim had unbearable pain in her stomach, her mother took her to the doctor
 doctor ne jaanch ke baad uski maa kopidita ke pregnantahone kii jaankaree di
 Hearing this, the ground slipped under his mother's feet
 maa ne jab usase sakhti se is bare main poocha to peedita rote hue boli, 'meri kokh main mere pita kaa baccha he
 The victim's mother immediately took her to the police station and lodged a complaint against her husband

 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president Amit Shah was in full bloom when he arrived in Kanpur's Hotel Kanha Galaxy on July 11 to review the party's mass campaign in UP
 bihar chunaav main ekatarfa jeet ke kchwab se unka hausala kulaanche bhar rahaa tha
 Firing between party leaders, he said, "BJP will win the 2017 assembly elections in UP and the party will retain power in the state for the next 25 years
 ” magar bihar chunaav ke nateezon ne shah ke ek khwab ko to chakanachur kar hi diya or ab kasuti par doosraa khwab aa gaya he
 The Bihar election results on November 8 brought the UP BJP in silence
 isi sannaate ke bich bijepi ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh or upi prabharee om maathur bihar chunaav sampann hone ke baad pehali baar 16 november kii subah 10 baje upi bijepi mukhyalay pahunche
 In the meeting of the field in-charge of the first organization elections and later in the Legislature party, Mathur very cleverly did not discuss the party's confessed leaders of Bihar but met the officials separately and talked about the future "khevanhar" of UP BJP His mind definitely searched
 bijepi ne chunaav bhale hi bihar main haara ho lekin uski chunautiyaan upi main zyada bad gai hai
 Like Bihar, there are strong regional political parties in front of it, whose break with Shah's warriors is not visible at the moment
 inhen chunautiyon ne achaanak upi main bijepi kii kamajoriyon ko jaahir kar diya he
 Incomplete search for face: The BJP, which won 71 mps from UP in the last Lok Sabha elections, has not been able to create a "face" which is universally acceptable among party leaders and workers even after one and a half years
 pradesh main sanghathanaatmak chunaav shuru ho chuke hai
 The atmosphere created after the Bihar elections has increased the dilemma of the BJP top leadership
 party yah tay nahin kar paa rahi he ki vah pradesh kii kaman kis jati ke netaa ko saunpe
 However, discussions have started in the name of a dozen leaders of UP at the top level who can be entrusted with huge responsibilities to correct social equations before the assembly elections
 bijepi ke sheersh netritv se judaa ek gut upi main party adhyaksh kii kaman fouran kisi obisi netaa ko saunpane kii vakaalat kar rahaa he, jabaki ek dhada lakshmikant bajpeyi ke rup main adhyaksh pad par brahman chehre ko na badalane kaa pairokaar he
 The BJP, which was badly defeated in the Bihar elections, is now going to explore the possibilities in which, in the nineties, on the lines of Kalraj mishra-kalyan Singh, an OBC face with a Brahmin state president is declared as the chief ministerial candidate for the next assembly election
 Be fought haalanki party ko kalyaan singh sareekha obisi netaa philhal najar nahin aa rahaa jise anya jatiyon kaa bhi samarthan hasil ho
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP, which became a weak link, had the support of a large section of the Dalit class, which had a 21 percent stake in UP, but in the assembly by-elections held a few months later, it appeared far from the party
 isi bich bijepi ne dalit netritv ubhaarne ke kram main agra se saansad ramshankar katheria ko kendriya mantriparishad main jagah di lekin ek varsh baad bhi ve bijepi ke dalit chehre ke rup main apni chhap chhod paane main safal sabit nahin hue hai
 Katheria hails from the Dhanuk fraternity
 daliton kii aabaadi main ati dalit 30 pratishat hai or dhanuk samaaj inamen keval do fisadi hissedari he
 Based on this data, the challenge of connecting Dalits or extreme Dalits with BJP in front of Katheria is like a mountain
 banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay main samajashaastra vibhaag main professor dow
 Ajit Kumar explains, "bjp's performance in the 2017 assembly elections will depend a lot on how much it makes a dent in the bsp's Dalit vote bank
 ” bijepi daliton main bhi mayawati ke kor votbank jatav ke alaava paasi or anya birdari kaa koi prabhavi cheharaa nahin talash pai he
 So the BJP, which is facing shortage of leaders, has opened its doors to those leaders who have either been expelled from the BSP or have been marginalized
 yaad aayaa “jansangh model”jansangh ke jamaane main party sanghathan kii ikai booth tha
 The BJP, which is trying to reorganize the organization in UP, has considered the booth as the primary unit, not considering the village and ward as the primary unit of the organization on the lines of the "jana Sangh Model"
 isi model se bijepi upi main sanghathanaatmak chunaav ke jariye booth str tak party loktantr ko sakriy karne main jute gai he
 The manipulative game has started once again with the announcement of the organizational election
 jila or mandal adhyaksh chunaav kii ladaai main 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke liye ye daavedaar bhi maidan main kud pade hai
 Ticket contenders are busy manipulating their president's win at all costs so that local support can be mobilized in the party
 gutbaji or antarkalah se jujh rahi bijepi ke liye sanghathanaatmak chunaav aag main ghi daalane kaa kaam karenge jo vidhansabha chunaav se pehle uski sehat ke liye katai thik nahin hoga
 However the party's organizational election in-charge and Chandauli MP Mahendranath Pandey denies this, saying, "bjp's organizational elections are like organization festivals
 isamen vivaad kii ashanka niraadhaar he
 "there may not be a change in the organization of UP BJP before the 2017 assembly elections, but the office of the party is changing in terms of Vastu
 shishe kii deevaaren or farsh par chamchamati safed tiles bijepi karyaalay ko ek korporate daftar jaisaa “luk” dengi
 Amidst these changes, the biggest challenge before the BJP is to become a party of the exploited and the underprivileged
 isi se bijepi kii jeet kaa aadhaar taiyaar hoga

 america ne bharat evam pakistan se apil kii he ki donon desh apane bich tanaav kam karne ke liye sidhi baatcheet karte rahen
 Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Heather Norte told reporters, "I believe the first thing we will do is that we will appeal to India and Pakistan to hold direct talks or encourage them to do so to reduce the tension between the two countries
" Can go america ke videsh mantri rex tilarsan ne isse ek din pehle pakistan ke saath kuch muddon par sauhardpurn sambandhon ke liye kuch kadam uthaane kii apil kii thi
 He answered this when asked questions related to Tillerson's statement to Heather
 
 
 
 So Afghanistan will become a graveyard for America: Taliban's warning comments Heather was asked at her daily press conference, what steps he was referring to that India could take? When asked if he was linking Kashmir's solution with pakistan-afghanistan, he said that according to the regional strategy, India and Pakistan are involved in dealing with the Afghanistan case
 us kshetra main un sabhi deshon ko shaamil karnaa madadgaar ho saktaa he, jo afghanistan ko aisa ek sthir sthaan banane main madad kar sakate he jahaan koi bhi aatankwaadi samooh nahin ho jo us desh main jaden jamaa sake yaa anya deshon par hamale kar sake

 On Wednesday, first RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav called a meeting of his mlas and then announced that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has neither asked for the resignation of Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav nor asked for clarification
 meeting ke baad kya bole laluargedy ke 80 vidhayakon ke saath baithak ke baad lalu yadav ne media se kaha ki nitish ne tejasvi kaa istipha nahin maanga he or naa hi safai maangi he
 Lalu said- Wherever he and Tejashwi have to put their point, they will keep there
 lalu ne kaha ki nitish mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar ke netaa hai
 RJD will actively support every move of the government
 argedy vidhayakon kii baithak kii adhyakshata rabari devi ne kii
 The RJD made it clear that Tejashwi will remain in the Legislature
 tejasvi istipha nahin denge: rabarividhayakon ke saath meeting ke baad rabari devi ne kaha ki tejasvi yadav par saare aarope jhuthe hai or ve istipha nahin denge
 Rabri Devi said that the BJP is plotting to trap us
 rabari devi ne bijepi netaa susheel modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki ve bahari vyakti hai unhen bihar se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Outsiders do not want to allow the development of Bihar, so we want to disrupt our work
 tejasvi yadav ne bhi di safayeedipti siem tejasvi yadav ne bhi istife kii baat se inkaar kiya he
 Tejashwi said that i was never asked for resignation
 tejasvi ne bijepi-aresas par bihar main mahagathbandhan todane kii sajeesh kaa aarope lagaaya
 He described BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi as an outsider, saying that he was not worried about the development and people of Bihar
 shivanand tiwari ne nitish par uthaae sawalis bich argedy pramukh lalu prasad ke kareebi shivanand tiwari ne mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par hi sawaal khadey kar die hai
 He has said, "I have known Nitish ji and his policy of zero tolerance on corruption for 40 years
 agar gade murde ukhdenge to baad aage tak jaaegi
 "going beyond this, Shivanand Tiwari said that Nitish was asked to talk with folded hands
 unhone kaha ki agar aapas main baat nahin karenge to gathbandhan kaise chalegaa
 After meeting with RJD mlas who will remain coward at the old stand, Lalu made it clear that RJD will continue to stand at its stand
 pichhali meeting main argedy ne tejasvi ke istife se saaf inkaar kar diya tha
 Why did Nitish call a meeting two days ago? It was already being said that Nitish could take a major decision after the presidential election
 mangalvaar ko dilli se lautne ke baad nitish ne buudhvaar ko hi baithak bula lee
 Earlier this meeting was to be held on 28 July
 gauratlab he ki11 july ko bhi nitishake sarkari awaas 1, anne maarg par jediu ke vidhayak dal kii baithak bulaai gai thi, jisamen is baat ko lekar maang uthi thi ki tejasvi yadav jinke upar bhrashtachar kaa aarope lag rahe hai, unhen apane pad se istipha dena chahie
 However, not being hasty about such a demand during that time, Nitish asked Tejashwi to answer the public allegations of corruption charges against him
 mana ja rahaa he ki pichley15 dinonmen tejasvi kii taraf se santusht purna jawaab nahin milane kii vajah se buudhvaar ko hone vaali vidhayak dal kii baithak main ek baar phir se tejasvi ke upar kadi karrwai kii maang uth sakati he
 Demand is likely to arise in this meeting that Nitish Kumar should take a firm decision on Tejashwi and dismiss him from his cabinet

 So that the fields are well looked after

 Afroz is angry with the government's policy of farmer interest
 unka maananaa he ki sarkaar kii jitani bhi yojanaayen hai, sabhi filon main hi hai
 He says that the government never researched farmers to benefit fully from farming
 unka kahana he ki jis tarah se desh main army ke liye shodh hote hai, tel ke liye shodh hota he, anya sansadhano ke liye shodh hota he, kabhi kisaani par koi shodh nahin hua
 VIDEO: Women's courage revived, life improved through mass farming VIDEO: mahilaon kii himmat ne ubaara, samuhik kheti se sanwari jindagi The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has blown the election bugle aiming to win 300 seats in the 2019 general elections
 chunaav se lagbhag 18 maheene pehle is bigul se saaf he ki bijepi ke saamne chunauti na sirf un rajyon main he, jahaan use mil rahaa vot share seat main tabdeel nahin ho rahaa balki un rajyon main bhi he jahaan sheersh vot share ke saath-saath vah vipaksh ko dhul chataane main safal hui thi
 Due to this, while West Bengal with 42 Lok Sabha seats is important for the strategy of party president Amit Shah, Uttar Pradesh with 80 seats is also at the center of the strategy
 in donon rajyon main amit shah kaa saamana mamata banerjee or mayawati se he or in donon main se ek ko maat dekar hi bijepi apane lakshya ko puraa kar sakati he
 Shah demanded 1 from the charge of Bengal
 5 karod vowemit shah ne 2019 ke aam chunaavon main jeet ko dhyaan main rakhte hue pashchim bengal ke prabharee ko 1
 Has targeted to collect 5 crore votes
 yadi bijepi 2019 main rajya se 1
 If it gets 5 crore votes then its vote share in the state elections will increase to 28-30 percent
 is vot share ke chalate amit shah ko pashchim bengal se 2019 main kam se kam 28-32 seat paane kii ummid he
 bjp's unitary state in UP In contrast, the past elections were very important for the BJP in Uttar Pradesh
 party ne loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon main modi lahar ke chalate vipakshi kshetreey partiyon kaa supada saaf kar diya
 Here in the 2017 assembly elections, BJP got 312 seats out of 403 with almost 40 percent vote share
 vahiin 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi ne 42 fisadi vot share ke saath 71 siton par jeet darj kii thi
 On the other hand Mayawati got 20 percent vote share in the Lok Sabha elections but her party did not succeed in winning a single seat
 or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main vah 22 fisadi vot share ke saath mahaj 19 seat jeet pai
 The victory in UP created the challenge, after this performance in Uttar Pradesh elections, bjp's challenge is to maintain it in 2019
 vahaan mil rahaa vot share or jeet main tabdeel hone vaali seat uske liye sheersh par hai
 On the basis of these figures of Uttar Pradesh, it can be said that the BJP has won everything in the state and in 2019 it has a challenge to save only its victory in Uttar Pradesh
 yani rajya main uske paas paane ke liye kam or ganvaane ke liye zyada he
 One of the maya-mamata will have to be given a Patkhani
 In order to maintain the 2014 general election figures in 2019, it is necessary for the BJP to recover any possible losses from Uttar Pradesh to West Bengal
 yani 2019 main bijepi ko 300 seat kaa lakshya puraa karne ke lieuttar pradesh or pashchimbengal main mayawati or mamata main se ek ko patkhni dena jaruri he
 On the other hand, Maya and Mamta manage to get charismatic figures in 2019 with the help of their hold on the land, then it is certain that Amit Shah's mathematics of reaching the goal of BJP will be completely spoiled

 The Congress-led UPA coalition needs just 12 more mps for a majority and it has many options to juggle this magical figure

 ye sabase aasaan vikalp ho saktaa he
 However, this possibility seems difficult
 aise main congress ko argedy ke 4, tiares ke 2, jedies ke 3, eimm ke ek saansad kaa sahyog mil saktaa he
 Together, they become 270 mps
 baankaa se nirdaleey digvijay singh or singhbhum se nirdaleey madhu kodaa kaa samarthan bhi mil saktaa he
 This completes the figure of 272
 ho saktaa he congress argedy kaa samarthan naa le
 In such a situation, four RJD mps can be compensated by five RLD mps
 digvijay singh or madhu kodaa ke saath bache nirdaleey saansadon kaa samarthan bhi liya ja saktaa he

 samalangik sambandhon ko nihaayat aniatik qaraar dekar inhen aparaadh kii shrenee se baahar rakhane par naamanzoori jataane ke baad sarkaar ne apana rukh palat liya
 After which the Supreme Court bench expressed displeasure
 grih mantralay kii ore se atirikt salisitor general peepi malhotra ne daleel di thi ki samalangik sambandh saamaajik vyavastha ke khilaaf hai or bhartiya samaaj videshon main vyaapt prachalanon ko nahin apana saktaa
 ASG Malhotra said before a bench of Justice GS Singhvi and Justice SJ Mukhopadhyay, "homosexual relationships are grossly immoral and against social order and such activities are much more likely to spread diseases (like AIDS)
" ’jaise hi media ne sarkaar ke rukh ko bayaan karnaa shuru kiya grih mantralay ne tatkaal eesg ke bayaan se duuri banaate hue adalati kaarywahi ke bich hi bayaan jari karte hue kaha ki usne samalangik sambandhon ko vaid qaraar dene ke dilli ucch nyaayalay ke faisle par koi rukh nahin jataayaa he
 The statement said, 'the Ministry of Home Affairs has not taken any stand on the issue of homosexuality
 grih mantralay ne cabinet ke faisle se avgat karaane ke alaava koi anya nirdesh bhi nahin diya he
 He told that the Attorney General has been asked to cooperate only with the apex court
 grih mantralay ne kaha ki is vishay par cabinet ne vichaar kiya or cabinet kaa faisla tha ki centre sarkaar ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle ke khilaaf koi apil nahin kar sakati
 As Malhotra concluded his arguments after the four-hour-long proceedings, another ASG Mohan Jain told the court that he had been instructed to send a message that the Center was not taking any stand on the issue
 jain kii antim minute main di gayi daleel par kadi aapatti darj karaate hue peeth ne kaha ki sarkaar ne apni daleelein pehle hi rakhi hai or adaalat unhen diye gayi nirdesh ko sangyaan main nahin le sakati
 The bench asked the public prosecutor in a strong tone, "do not give such statements in court
" isse aapako hi pareshaani hogi
 'the bench said,' Government of India is pleading in the case
 usne apni daleelein rakhi hai
 We will not allow you to make such a statement that the Ministry of Home Affairs did not instruct ASG Malhotra
 ham aapke nirdeshon ko sangyaan main nahin le rahe
 When Jain said that the government would file an affidavit, the bench said in a stern tone that it was not needed as the final hearing in the case had started and he had full freedom to assist the court in the case
 baad main sampark kiye jane par malhotra ne is baat par jor diya ki vah grih mantralay kii taraf se paksh rakh rahe the
 The court fixed February 28 for the next hearing
 isse pehle malhotra ne adaalat main kaha tha, ‘hamaara samvidhan alag he or hamaare naitik evam saamaajik mulya bhi anya deshon se alag hai isliye ham unka paalan nahin kar sakate
 'he argued that the social disapproval of homosexual relations is in itself sufficient reason to consider it a crime
 ye aprakritik hai isliye aparaadh hai
 He opposed the Delhi High Court ruling that Indian society does not approve of homosexuality and the law cannot be separated from society
 dilli ucch nyaayalay ne 2009 main samalangik sambandhon ko aparaadh kii shrenee se baahar karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code describes homosexual relations as a crime, which carries a maximum punishment of life imprisonment
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne samalangik sambandhon kii vaidhata ko chunauti dene vaale sanghathanon se kal kaha tha ki anya deshon main is vishay par lagu kanoonon ke bare main bataaen
 The apex court asked anti-homosexuality rights groups to increase their scope by registering protests over the High Court verdict and not confine them to mere physical relations
 peeth ne kaha tha ki samalangikta ko badalte samaaj ke pariprekshya main dekha janaa chahie kyonki kai chijen jo pehle naamanzoor hoti thim, samay ke saath saath sweekaarya ho gayi hai
 It has been a full year since the GST has been implemented across the country, on this occasion, the central government also celebrated and celebrated its achievement
 jiesti par abhi tak kai tarah ke sawaal uthte hai inpar pradhanmantri narendra modi ne karaara jawaab diya he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi rejected the concept of taxing all goods under the GST regime at the same rate
 unhone kaha ki marcides car or doodh par ek hi dar se kar nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 He said that if the Congress party's demand to impose a tax at the same rate of 18 percent on all goods under GST is accepted, then it will increase the tax on food grains and many essential items
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki jiesti lagu hone ke ek saal ke bheetar hi apratyaksh karadaataaon kaa aadhaar 70 pratishat tak bad gaya
 With its implementation the check-posts were abolished, it included 17 different taxes, 23 cesses and made one
 modi ne kaha ki jiesti samay ke saath behatar hone vaali pranali he
 It has been continuously improved on the basis of information and experiences received from the State Governments, business people and relations parties

 Can we tax milk and Mercedes at the same rate? He said that so when our friends of Congress say that we should have only one rate of GST, they say that it means food and other consumers
 Commodities are to be taxed at the rate of 18 percent
 jabaki vartmaan main in utpaadon par shunya athwa paanch pratishat kii dar se kar lagaaya ja rahaa he
 In an interview released on the website of Swaraj magazine, Modi said that only 66 lakh indirect taxpayers were registered since independence, while after the GST came into force on July 1, 2017, the number of these taxpayers has registered 48 lakh new entrepreneurs

 If GST is really complicated then can we expect such figures? Modi said that before that many taxes on products were hidden but GST system is such that you pay what you see in it 
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne kareeb 400 vastuon ke samooh main kar kii dar kam kii he, kareeb 150 vastu samoohon par shunya dar se jiesti rakhaa gaya he
 If you see, the tax rate on most of the daily consumption items has actually come down

 There was a lot of speculation after the grand reception of Rajasthan leader Om Mathur on the road from Delhi to Jaipur, but Om Mathur, who arrived in Jaipur, said that the news of his becoming Chief Minister in Rajasthan was completely concocted and Mischievously spread news on social media
 uttar pradesh main bhaajapa ko bahumat dilaane ke baad rajasthan kii sar jameen par kadam rakhte hi om maathur kaa bhavy swaagat kiya gaya
 As soon as they entered the border of Delhi with Rajasthan, the workers were greeted with heavy tam-jah
 haalat ye ho gai ki jaipur pahunchate-pahunchate shaam ho gai
 BJP workers welcomed Om Mathur to Jaipur as soon as he reached Om Mathur's house
 is maukey par ajtak se om maathur ne kaha, 'uttar pradesh kii jeet pradhan mantri narendra modi kii jeet he or is jeet ke peeche narendra modi dwaara janata ko di gayi yojanaayen hai
 On the arrival in Rajasthan and seeing Om Mathur in Rajasthan as Chief Minister, he replied that this news is completely wrong
 haalanki unhone kaha ki sanghathan jo bhi jimmedaari degaa use puri tarah se sweekaar kiya jayega
 On the other hand, the BJP also completely rejected the speculation of a change of power in the state
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh ashok paranami ne kaha ki vasundhara ji kahin nahin ja rahi hai or vahiin mukhyamantri hai or aage bhi rahengi
 The news of the change of power is false and rumored

 When Yash Birla was just 22 years old, he had to lose his family in a plane crash in Bangalore

 isaki jagah isamen aisa shaks najar aata he jo sharaab ko haath tak nahin lagaataa or aadhyatm tathaa khubasurat body ke prati gahari patibaddhta rakhata he
 At the end of this book, the reason for this contradiction is understood
 jab har taraf avyavashtha ho tab niyantran hi sab kuch hota he
 Gautam (singhania) started talking to Sonia (garware) and Lalit (modi) about a sports car they wanted to buy
 unhone kaha, ''orange color main yah itani jabardast lagati he jisaki aap kalpana bhi nahin kar sakate
 “I felt inside myself sitting there with so many people, my friends, that i am an outsider here
 
 
 yah ham logon kaa nayaa group tha or abhi ham sabko ek-duusare ke bare main kaaphi kuch jaananaa tha
 Jaideep (garware) went to the balcony and offered a drink to a girl
 
 
 ham pandrahavin manzil par the or vahaan se jabardast najaara dikh rahaa tha
 He was drinking heavily, crowds inside the apartment (in Mumbai) were diving into the ocean of drunkenness
 kuch logon ke haath main chote packet the or ve bathroom main do yaa kabhi-kabhi teen ke group main andar jate the, kokene tab itani aam nahin thi, lekin charas kaa dhuaan khub udata tha
 In such a group, there was often a boy who would beat two or three girls and take 'puff' with them
 
 
 saath milakar charas kaa role taiyaar kiya jaataa tha or ladkiyaan kash lagaati thim
 i would see them stalking, their eyes used to be expressionless
 
 
 yah sab dekhakar main kaaphi pareshaan ho jaataa tha
 Everyone knew that i could not be forced into these things — they had tried it, i was not stuck
 yah mere jivan kaa ek aisa hissaa tha jahaan mere doston ke dabaav kaa koi asar nahin hota tha
 Drugs, cigarettes, alcohol — i did not want to touch any of them, but this would sometimes create a 'spectacle'
 khaas logon kii yah toli sab kuch karti thi or mujhe dekhte rahane kii ijaajat thi
 Gautam used to say, 'bring more water for Yash' and everyone started laughing
 mujhe in sabaki aadat pad gai thi
 *** i was thinking, tonight will be fun
 hotel (singapore) main ground floor par bana nitaclub khachaakhach bharaa hua tha
 In Bombay too, everyone had a lot of fun, but they always had to be a little vigilant
 unhen apane parivaar ke naamon ko bachaana hota tha; apni pratishtha ko bachaae rakhana hota tha
 But nobody cared here
 ham baithe hi the ki jaani-pahachaani dikh rahi mahila hamaari mej ke kareeb ai
 She was the Air Hostess of Air India and we saw her at Bombay Airport
 gautam ko vah aakarshak lagi or jayadeep ne turant hi uske kareeb jaakar poocha ki ab uski kahaan kii flite he
 He was to travel to Singapore and both agreed that they would spend the next few days together
 
 
 maine himmat jutakar us air hostes se poocha ki kya vah mere saath dance karegi
 
 
 When i started dancing with Air Hostess, i was watching Jai and Sujata who were dancing in a corner
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki un donon main gaharaa pyaar he
 On the other hand, my dance partner started getting seduced in a short time
 vah mere kandhon ko chhu rahi thi or mere sir ke peeche baalo ko dhire-dhire sahalaane lagi
 She was attractive, but i was cautious
 mere aise kai anubhav rahe the jinase yah pataa chalaa ki ladkiyaan sirf mere parivaar ke naam kii vajah se mere kareeb ai thim
 Such relationships proceeded to a certain height, but in the end it always proved to be a failure for me
 ve meri vajah se nahin balki mere parivaar kii vajah se mere saath rahanaa chaahati thim
 The Birla surname meant something to him which i could never fully understand
 
 
 maine thodi der aaraam karne kaa man banaaya or apane kamare kii taraf bad gaya
 
 
 i had just got out of the bathroom to hear the sound of the bell ringing
 
 
 main daravaaje tak gaya or pipahole se baahar jhankane kii koshish kii
 It was an Asian woman
 
 
 'main aapaki kya madad kar saktaa hum?’ maine usase poocha
 She replied, 'I have come to see you' and she kind of entered the room pushing me beyond
 fishnet stocking or miniskurt pahani hui is mahila ke bal kaaphi lambey the or uski peeth ke neeche tak aa rahe the
 She had a lot of make-up and her cheeks were as if painted red
 uskaa top laal rang ke jhine kapade kaa tha jo uske badan se kasakar chipka hua tha or uske nakhun kaaphi lambey or nukile the
 She sat comfortably on one side of my bed
 darwaja khulaa hi rakhte hue maine usase kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki aap galat room number main aa gai he
 'he said,' You are fame? ' i said, 'yes, this is my name
 ’ usne jor dekar kaha, 'phir to sahi room number he! tum baitho!’ maine sochaa yah koi majaak he
 Is this woman a prostitute? i still could not digest that the woman in my room is sitting, saying that she has been sent 'for me'
 maine usase poocha, 'main aapke liye kya kar saktaa hum?’ usne bistar kii ore sanket karke kaha, 'ham, tum boom-boom yani maje karenge
 
 
 'I understood the woman and said,' Listen, i don't need you
 ’ vah philippines mul kii veshya thi or nishchit rup se mujhe usamen koi dilchaspee nahin thi
 Also, it was no secret to my friends that i was still a virgin
 mere liye yah baat or bhi asahaj thi ki main pehali baar kisi is tarah kii aurat ke saath jismani sambandh kaayam karun
 Opening his shoulder straps he said, 'may i take off my clothes?' i immediately stuck and said, 'no, don't stop
 ham baat karte hai
 
 
 'I tried to understand that woman,' i know it is very important for you to take responsibility of family, but this business is very bad
 tumhe yah nahin karnaa chahie
 
 
 He said, 'I know! But where will the money come from? ' i said, 'why don't you work in a store? You are beautiful, if you want, you can do anything else
 ’usne turant jawaab diya, 'agar main haseen hum to mere saath maje kyon nahin karte ho?’ main funs gaya tha
 
 
 i made a weak excuse: 'I am not well
 ’ usne mere maathe par haath rakhaa jo barf jaisaa thanda tha
 He said, 'you don't have fever!' Lashing his hand away, i constantly tried to make him understand that he should do some other work
 meraa yah upadesh kareeb 20 minute tak chalata rahaa, ant main mahila ne tiraskaar se yah jataayaa ki vah to us paise ke evaj main kuch karnaa chaahati thi, jo use kisi ne diya he or kamare se baahar ho gai
 
 maine baahar jaakar dekha to sujatha or jai ek kamare se baahar jhaankate hue dikhe
 They were watching me
 maine unase poocha, 'yah sab kya tha?’ unhone ekadam darwaja band kar diya or jor-jor se hansane lage
 When i started banging on the door, Sujatha opened it and looked at my face sympathetically
 andar jayadeep or jai farsh par baithe apane haath uthaa-uthaakar joro se hans rahe the
 i asked, 'who has done all this?' Jaideep said, 'guddu, we were listening to everything you set your ears to
 ’main shame se laal ho gaya
 Still laughing, Jay shouted, 'guddu has given him a speech!' i still could not understand what jokes were in it which was beyond my comprehension
 jayadeep ne kaha, 'yash! hamen lagata tha ki aaj tumhaara comarya bhang ho jayega
 'of course he had teased my sore throat
 ant main mujhe pataa chalaa ki lalit modi ne bombai main baithkar hi kuch logon ko phone kar yah sab karne ko kaha he
 Gautam and Jaideep were part of this joke and Lalit had no idea how my dad had even convinced him to join it
 
 
 bombai main baithkar lalit or mere dead ko pal-pal kii khabar mil rahi thi
 
 
 'now she has gone to the room, Yash is telling her something, it is not good

 Defending champions India defeated South Korea's all-out counterattack and won 3–2 today, retaining their unbeaten campaign in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament

 India started quite aggressively
 halppa or vikaas pillai ne shandaar move banaaye jin par mandeep antil or tushaar khandekar ne korian dephence par kai hamale bole
 India got their first penalty corner in the fifth minute when Halappa was interrupted by Korean captain Lee Naim Young
 doosraa penlti carnor bhi jaldi hi mila lekin dhananjay mahadic naakaam rahe
 The Indians finally got success in the tenth minute when Halappa and Shivendra put the ball within the goal
 korian golkeeper yung ho baglein jhaankate rah gaye
 Korea quickly retaliated and Woo scored on the first penalty corner two minutes later

 railway ne piares counter se ho rahi tikat booking main nakadi kii dikkat se bachane ke liye tikat cancellation main 5000 yaa isse zyada kii rifund ko sambandhit vyakti ke khate main dene kaa faisla kiya he
 Earlier on November 10, the limit of refund in the account was more than 10,000
 railway ke aalaa afasaron ke mutabik aisa do vajahon se kiya gaya he pehali vajah he ki railway counter ko nakadi kii samasya se jujhna pad rahaa he
 Most people are coming with 500 and 1000 rupee notes for ticket booking because the railway has got instructions to take old notes till the 24th, so people cannot be denied
 darasalrailway counterpar zyaadaatar log bade note lekar hi aa rahe hai is vajah se toote paison kii badi dikkat ho rahi he
 The second biggest reason is that this decision has been taken to stop those who are trying to book tickets in the railway in the hope of turning their black money white
 railway ke adhikariyon ke mutabik 8 taarikh ko jab note bandi ghoshit kii gai thi tab tak railway main counter parexpress trenonke liye PRS booking band ho chuki thi
 Total ticket booking 109 on 8th
 5 karod kii hui thi isamen PRS booking 45 karod rupee kii thi
 On the 9th, the railways was taking old notes under note closure, due to this, people booked thousands of tickets in AC One, AC Two and AC 3 at all the places, due to this, Railways got a total of 126 on the 9th
 8 karod rupee kii tikat booking isamen 67
 a ticket of Rs 4 crore was booked through PRS
 yani tikat counter par log 500 or 1000 ke note dekar andhadhundh tikat book kara rahe the
 It was being done in the hope of booking a ticket that when the ticket is canceled, the railway will give a lot of new notes to the bookmaker in place of the old notes, so that people hope that some part of the black money will turn white
 lekin 10 taarikh ko jab railway ke aalaa afasaron ke paas is tarah kii khabaren pahunchane lagi to unhone aanan-fanan main ek faisla liya
 That decision was that for those who book tickets for more than ₹ 10,000 by November 14, the railway will not give cash refund to such people, but such money will be transferred to the account of the person concerned
 jab yah faisla liya gaya tab shaam ho chuki thi 10 taarikh ko hui booking par najar daalen to 10 taarikh ko 126
 a ticket booking of 2 crores was made and out of this, 59 booking through PRS
 55 karod rupee kii thi
 That is, the decision was less because of the decision than the day before
 ₹1 xxrep 4 0 se zyada kii tikat ke cancellation kii rakam sambandhit vyakti ke acount main dene kaa faisla rang laayaa 11 taarikh ko, is din railway ke jariye apane kaale dhan ko safed karne kii ummid maandey logon ko jab yah najar aane laga ki ab koi rasta nahin he to unhone booking kam karai 11 taarikh ko 110 karod rupee kii dhan raashi kii tikat booking hui isamen piares counter par booking mahaj 45
 9 crores
 yani 1 din pehle kii booking ke mukaable takreeban 25 fisadi kii sidhi giravat
 This simply meant that the railway's decision soon dispelled the misgivings of the people and people desperate to turn their black money through railway tickets became desperate
 12 taarikh kii baat karen toralway kii tikat bookingka aankada mahaj 98 karod rupee kaa hi rahaa isamen piares counter par booking or gir kar 37 karod rupee par pahunch gai
 Railway ticket booking stood at Rs 79 crore on 13th and bookings at the PRS counter were reduced to just Rs 23 crore
 14 taarikh kii baat karen to is din kul tikat booking 106 karod rupee kii hui jisamen piares tikat booking 44 karod rupee kii rahi
 Overall, it can be said that people who are trying to make their money white through railway ticket booking counter are no longer coming here
 in sthitiyon main railway ne tikat cancellation main gas rifund kii limit 10,000 se ghataakar ₹5000 kar di he isse nishchit taur par un logon ko tej jhatka lagegaa jo railway se tikat kara kar apane paise ko safed karnaa chaah rahe hai

 Vikas Sharma, vice president, marketing assistant, Ufius Lernig, and Indra Kohli, principal of Noida-based Delhi Public School, have suggested that children can enjoy a holiday with their family

 Bring the old-time Kashish alive - such parents, who were born in the year 80 or earlier, will remember these things and they will be able to see themselves by connecting with it
 ek aisa bhi samay tha jab garmi kii chhuttiyon kaa matlab ghanton tivi dekhnaa, cellphone par vyast rahanaa or be sirpair kii baton main samay khapaana nahin hota tha
 He used to lose time in the world of books, play interactive outdoor games, write letters to friends (letter-friends) and so on

 No one would want to send their child to play in the park outside the house in a hot afternoon, but if your child is busy only in indoor activities, then there is a possibility that he may not get mixed up in the society
 yahi haal rahaa to mahamari ban jayega motopa!3
 In the lap of nature - children should be made aware and responsible towards the environment and help them to form a relationship with nature
 takneekee baadhaon se dur kisi nechar camp main bitaayaa gaya ek haftaa bacchon ke man main prakruti maa ke liye prem kaa beej bone main badi prerana kaa kaam karegaa or unhen santulit va acchhee jindagi jeene ke liye prakruti tathaa paryaavaran ke mahatv ko samajhane kaa mauka bhi degaa

 Most of them were Karsevaks, returning from a program in Ayodhya under the Ram Mandir movement
 aag se jhulaskar 59 karsevakon kii maut ho gai thi
 Which gave a huge political form to this incident and put an indelible stain on the forehead of Gujarat
 modi ne bulaai thi baithkajis vakt ye haadasa hua, narendra modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri the
 At that time this incident was seen as a conspiracy
 ghatana ke baad shaam main hi modi ne baithak bulaai thi
 All questions arose about the meeting
 aarope lage ki baithak main 'kriya kii pratikriya' hone kii baat saamne ai thi
 The Godhra carnage was believed to be a conspiracy fire
 train main bheed dwaara petrol daalkar aag lagane kii baat godhra cond kii jaanch kar rahe naanavati ayog ne bhi maani thi
 However, on the very next day of the Godhra incident, the matter became turbulent
 28 farvari ko godhra se karsevakon ke shav khule trek main ahmedabad laae gaye the
 This incident also became a matter of discussion
 in shavon ko parijanon ke bajaay vishwa hindu parishad ko saunpa gaya tha
 Soon this incident of Godhra train took the form of riots in Gujarat
 esaiti court main kesasaiti kii vishesh adaalat ne ek march 2011 ko is maamle main 31 logon ko doshi qaraar diya tha jabaki 63 ko bari kar diya tha
 Of these, 11 convicts were sentenced to death, while 20 were sentenced to life imprisonment
 baad main ucch nyaayalay main kai apil daayar kar doshasiddhi ko chunauti di gai jabaki rajya sarkaar ne 63 logon ko bari kiye jane ko chunauti di thi
 After the Patidar movement turned leader Hardik Patel got bail from the High Court in all the cases including treason, the politics of Gujarat got heated
 jahaan bijepi se naaraaz chal rahe patidaaron ko rijhaane ke liye congress lagi hui he, vahiin bijepi patidaaron ko yah kahkar manaa rahi he ki hardik ko jamaanat anandiben sarkaar naram rukh kii vajah se mili he
 Before Hardik came out of jail, his letter was written from the jail, Patel said that till the Patidars get justice, their fight will continue
 ahmedabad ore surat ke rajdroh ke cese ke badvisanagar hinsa kesamen hardik patel ko mili jamaanat ke baad ab ye tay ho gaya he ki vah jald hi jail se bahaar hoga
 People of the Patidar community, who work with Hardik, say that he will come out of jail on July 15 in the morning
 hardik ki rihaai se pehle mangalvaar ko uskaa khat baahar aayaa he
 Hardik wrote in a letter to Eredjeel, who remained strong in prison and wrote that i have full faith in the Indian Constitution
 kaaphi vakt baad jeet mili he
 Nine months have been spent in the mother's womb, as much time spent in prison as she has to learn a lot
 main koi criminal nahin hum
 Staying in jail made my intentions stronger
 amit shah se kabhi nahin mila hardikhardik ne likhaa he ki9 maheene jail memrajanatik gandagi ko kaise saaf karnaa ye bhi sikhataa rahaa
 i have never met BJP President Amit Shah or any of his leaders or any Congress leader

 Hardik Patel's partner Varun Patel says that the government had no soft attitude in getting bail
 sarkaar ke vakil ne to kaaphi sakht daleel pesh kii thi
 This can be clearly seen from the copy of Judgment
 2017 vidhansabha chunaav main patidaaron kii ranneetihardik ke jail se baahar aane ke baad hardik patel kii ranneeti kya hogi? patidaaron kaa aarakshan andolan or kitna majboot banegaa? gujarat hai court ne 6 maheene gujarat ke baahar rahane ke liye kaha he
 Where will he go during that time remains a question

 Patidars constitute 17 per cent in Gujarat and Patidar votes dominate about 50 seats including Saurashtra, North Gujarat, South Gujarat
 agar hardik patel ke jail se baahar aane ke baad andolan tej hua to bijepi ko patidaaron kii naaraazgi kaa baari khamiyaja bhugatna pad saktaa he
 The bjp-congress tug of credit has been repeatedly lamenting that the government has an important role in getting Hardik out of jail
 gujarat congress ke pravaktaa manish doshi kaa kahana he ki jis patidaaron ne bijepi ko satta main bithaaya, usee ne patidaaron ko jail main daalaa
 Patidars have decided to complete the program after Hardik comes out of jail
 hardik jab jail se baahar aane vakt kareeb 25000 patidaar uskaa swaagat karenge
 After this a big meeting will be held in Surat
 ek din ke liye gaanv jane kii mili ijajatahardik ne court se ijaajat maangi thi ki use apni kuladevi ke darshan ke liye unja janaa he, lekin court ne uske 9 maheene tak mahesena jane par pratibandh laga diya he
 However, on the special request of Hardik, the court has allowed him to come to his home in Viramgaon to get his goods
 kul devi ke darshan ke liye jaaenge hardikpulice pehre main hardik jis rajya main janaa chahenge vahaan jaakar unhen chhod diya jayega
 According to the Patidars, Hardik will first visit the temple of his Kuldevi, Khodaldham and then go to his house after seeing Sarangpur Hanuman
 iske baad unhen gujarat chod dena hoga
 Can go to UP, Delhi or Rajasthan hardikpilhalpatidar Reservation Movement Committee spokesperson Varun Patel says that Hardik can go to Delhi, Rajasthan or Lucknow of UP
 20 july ko hardik patel kaa janmdin he
 By the way, Hardik is coming out of jail on the 15th before the birthday

 jab-jab aisa lagane lagata he ki aatank se raahat milane vaali he
 Then, another news comes, which instead of relief, causes panic
 duniya ko abhi laga hi tha ki iesas kaa khaatmaa kareeb he or tabhi iesas ne apana aakhri daanv khel diya
 The stakes also doubled in one stroke
 khabar ye he ki bagdadi ne gathbandhan kar liya he
 al-qaeda from the dreaded terrorist organization like myself
 ab is gathbandhan kaa nateeja kya hoga
 It is difficult to guess this now
 ISIS ne alqaida se milaayaa haaydavatein bhi thi
 There were also shades
 dushmani bhi thi
 But the script of the world of terror says that if there is trouble in front, then you should join hands with each other
 usee main bhalaai he
 These are the last attempts to find hope in the hope of the terrorists born from the current situation in Iraq and Syria
 jo iesas ne aatank kii duniya ke apane sabase bade dushman alqaida se haath milakar kii he
 In order to save their desolate Sultanate, Baghdadi enforced Jawahiri
 
 Aurajwahiri has extended her hand to Baghdadi
 
 Hand of friendship of terrorist 
 So that the name remains
 
 ISIS as well as Al Qaeda
 
 Otherwise, the situation has been created in Iraq and Syria
 
 Neither is Baghdadi's well being alone in that
 
 Nor that of the Nusra Front of Al Qaeda
 
 G
 Nusra Front
 
 By the same name, Al Qaeda is fighting the Assad government as a rebel in Syria
 iraq ke uparashtrapati ne kiya khulhastank ke is mahagathbandhan kaa khulaasa kisi agency ne nahin balki iraqi ke up-raashtrapati ayaad alvi ne kiya he
 It is obvious that there will be some seriousness in these claims
 or agar aisa he to kam se kam ye un logon ke liye khayr kii khabar to nahin jo iraq or syria main inke changul vaale ilaakon main rah rahe hai
 We cannot say that since when but it is so certain that talks are going on in both the terrorist organizations
 bagdadi or jawahiri ke madhyasth log aapas main gathbandhan kii baat kar rahe hai
 ISIS terror will not end without such a road map
 samarthan or raajnneetik hastkshep ke jang ke baad ke halaat par kaabo kar paanaa mushkil hoga
 As we know, even if ISIS is eradicated from Iraq, it is not going to die
 ye jang lambii chhidane vaali hai kyonki iesas ab puri duniya main fail chukaa he
 We have full information that both the terrorist organizations are planning to fight together
 lihaaza yahaan se unke khatme ke baad bhi puri duniya main unke slipper cell maujuud rahenge
 The only way to escape the terrorists is that the latest ISIS situation in Iraq is that iraqi-american forces, Kurdish fighters and Shia militias have almost done their job
 or le-dekar ab mosul ke kuch gaanvon tak hi inke nishaan baaki hai
 At the same time, Syrian forces, along with Russia, have almost done the same thing to al-qaeda in their country
 aise main ab in donon ke paas iklauta yahi rasta bachaa he
 To save your life and also to save your name
 khatre ko bhaanp kar saath aae donon aatanki sanghathanhaalanki kaayade se dekhen to 2003 takaies alqaidaaki hi branch thi
 But after the overthrow of Saddam, Baghdadi created ISIS in the craze of declaring himself a Khalifa and forming his own organization
 or dekhte hi dekhte apni darindagi kii vajah se bagdadi kaa ye sanghathan iraq or syria ke saath saath puri duniya main dehshat kaayam karne main kaamyaab rahaa
 On the other hand, Al Qaeda began to face danger on its own existence
 lihaaza donon guton main pichley 5-6 saalon se varchasv kii jang chal rahi thi
 But now both of them have understood that the war of supremacy will happen when the name survives and that is why the friendship of terror has moved ahead from both the sides and now it is a threat to the world that these two dreaded terrorist organizations Maybe together now
 fouj par chemical atekairaq or syria se jate-jate iesas ke aatankwaadi apane dushmano par aakiri chot karnaa chaahate hai
 Abu Bakr al-baghdadi, the leader of the terrorists, has already run back from maidan-e-jung, while the remaining terrorists in Mosul are carrying out chemical attacks on the army
 pichley do dinon main in aatankwaadiyon ne do rasaynic hamale kiye hai
 In such a situation, the biggest danger of these attacks is on the heads of innocent cities trapped in the middle of the war
