 italy ke rajdutko supreme court ne notice jari kiya he
 Notice The Italian ambassador Daniel Manciniako has been ordered not to leave India until 18 March
 isse pehle kendriya grih mantralay ne videsh mantralay ko salaah di thi ki vah italvi nausainikon ke maamle main supreme court se anurodh kare ki jin logon ne halafanama diya he, unke khilaaf karrwai kii jaae
 Diplomatic benefit should not be given in this case as it is being sued by giving an affidavit in the country's highest court
 hatya aaropee nausikon ke maamle main italy ke hastkshep par PM hue sakhtgrih mantralay ne yah bhi kaha he ki yah vienna samjhaute kaa ulanghan nahin hoga kyonki yah kisi rajanyik ke khilaaf uthaaya jane vaala kadam nahin balki adaalat ko gumraah karne kaa maamla he
 Following the advice of the Ministry of Home Affairs and the stern stance of the Prime Minister, there is an increased possibility that the Italian ambassador may be arrested in a contempt case of the Supreme Court
 is cese main italy kii ore se bataur vakil mukadmaa lard rahe harish salve ne italy sarkaar ke kadam ko durbhagyapurna bataate hue khud ko puure maamle se alag kar liya he
 Salve says that since the Italian ambassador himself took part in the process of Indian law and order, he cannot get diplomatic exemption to avoid legal action in this case
 sutron ke mutabik is maamle main grih mantralay or videsh mantralay ke sachiv or varisht adhikariyon kii ek baithak hui
 According to Foreign Ministry sources, the Home Ministry officials stated in clear terms that a case is legally made against the person who gave the affidavit
 ab sarkaar ko chahie ki vah supreme court se anurodh kare ki vah avmaananaa kii karrwai shuru kare
 The main opposition party BJP has called the country's sovereignty a challenge to the incident of not returning two Italian naval men accused of killing Indian fishermen
 party ne kaha he ki italy ne chal or dhokhaa ke jariye hamaari samprabhutaa ko chunauti di he or aise main italy ke rajdoot par kanoonee karrwai honi chahie
 Arun Jaitley, Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha, has also mentioned measures under which the Italian ambassador can be kept out of the ambit of diplomatic exemption

 (input: bhashaa) Ramvilas Paswan, a minister in the Modi government and president of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), said that the Congress is talking about giving unconditional support to women's reservation, but just talk to your allies
 sapa or argedy kya bina shart mahila aarakshan par raji hai
 Apart from this, Paswan targeted Mayawati and said that she does two things
 satta main rahane par kuch or vipaksh main rahane par kuch
 Paswan said that you first agree on women's reservation and then tell me
 mahila aarakshan bill pehle hi aa gaya hota agarasapa or argedy hi aarakshanke andar aarakshan kii maang na karte to
 Do Mulayam Singh Yadav agree on the unconditional support of the Congress, if it is so
 paswan ne basapa adhyaksh mayawati ko nishane par lete hue kaha ki satta main rahati hai to kuch baaten karti hai or vipaksh main rahete hue kuch
 Two types of things should not be done
 2007 main satta main rahete hue mayawati ne khud hi kaha tha ki SC / ST act ko lekar galat istemaal hota he
 SC / ST Act should be imposed only after SSP investigation
 ab jab yahi baat supreme court ne kahi to ve virodh karne vaale ladakon ke saath khadi hai
 Paswan said that while Kimayawati came to power with absolute majority in 2007, she said that caution should be exercised in the implementation of the Dalit Act
 kabhi-kabhi dabang vyakti ke ishaare par is act kaa durupyog hota he
 In such a situation, SC / ST Act should be imposed only after SSP investigation
 itnaa hi nahin unhone dalit mahila ke saath hue balaatkaar maamle par kaha tha ki doctor ke medical kii report ke baad act lagaaya janaa chahie
 When the Supreme Court said the same thing, they are standing in protest
 paswan ne kaha ki mayawati hamensha to tarah kii baaten karti hai
 Some inside and some in power and some in opposition
 paswan ne mayawati ke puraane naaron kii yaad dilaai ki kaise satta main aane se pehle unke raajnneetik naare kuch or hote the or satta main aane ke baad kaise unke naare badalte chale gaye
 The revelation of the scandal in the Rafale plane deal has now revealed new ones
 ajtak ko pataa chalaa he ki modi sarkaar ke dauraan hui rafel deal upie sarkaar kii tulana main prati vimaan 59 karod rupee sasti he
 That is, on every Rafale aircraft, the Modi government saved Rs 59 crore compared to the Manmohan government
 ajtak ko mili exclusive jaankaree ke mutabik, modi sarkaar ne is vishesh ladaaku vimaan kii deal main desh kaa paisa bachaaya he or congress sarkaar kii tulana main har vimaan kaa sauda 59 karod rupee sasta kiya gaya he
 According to these documents, the deal that Modi government has done for 36 aircraft for 59000 thousand crore rupees, if the same deal would have happened during UPA, then its value would be 1
 69 lakh karod rupee hoti
 Accordingly, the Modi government signed an aircraft deal for Rs 1646 crore, while in UPA the price was Rs 1705 crore
 zyada majboot he vimanjankaree ke mutabik jis vimaan kii deal modi sarkaar ne kii he vah upie sarkaar dwaara liye ja rahe vimaan se kaaphi zyada asardaar or takneekee rup se adhik sakasham bataaya ja rahaa he
 The aircraft also has missiles like METEOR and SCALP, which were not in the fighter aircraft being taken under the UPA deal
 dastavejon se ye jaankaree bhi saamne ai he ki modi sarkaar ne jis vimaan kii deal kii he, usamen bharat ke liye vishesh rup se 13 chijen badhaai gai hai, jo duusare deshon ko nahin di jaati hai
 However, the Congress alleges that there is no talk of transfer of any kind of technology in this new deal
 isliye achaanak daam badhane kii baat samaj nahin aati he
 The Congress scam allegations have been raising voice against the Modi government for a long time regarding the Congress Rafael Deal
 sadak se lekar sansad tak or press conference se lekar soshal media tak congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or unke netaa modi sarkaar par rafel deal main ghotaale kaa aarope lagaate rahe hai
 The Congress claims that the Modi government is buying the same aircraft that the UPA government had bargained for, at three times the price
 congress kaa kya he daawa?purv rakshaamantri eke antni ne kaha ki kai companiyon se baat karne ke baad disambar, 2012 main rafel ko select kiya gaya or 126 aircraft lene kii baat kii gai thi
 The company to which the Modi government has given this deal has neither the experience of making aircraft nor of combat aircraft
 iske kaaran HAL ke bhi kai ejiniyaron ko apni naukari haath se ganvaani padi
 The Congress alleged that there was no talk of transfer of any kind of technology in this new deal
 purv raksha mantri eke antni ne kaha ki upie sarkaar kii deal ke anusaar, 126 main se 18 aircraft hi france main banane the baaki sabhi HAL ke dwaara bharat main banane the
 He said that when there is no secret deal, then why is the government not showing the price? The Congress also claims that France has sold similar aircraft to Egypt and Qatar at a lower price, then at the time of India But how did the prices become higher

 Senior Congress leader Kishore Chandra Dev has said in the context of the current state of his party that it would not have been the plight of the Congress if Rahul Gandhi had fulfilled half the promises made after becoming the vice-president
 paanch baar saansad rahane ke baad is baar loksabhaa chunaav main haar gaye nivartmaan kendriya mantri dev ne party adhyaksh sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi se is baat par aatmamanthan karne ko kaha
 He said, the largest old party needs to be saved from the clutches of the leaders who have been cut off from their roots and grow on the support of others, who have held the party in power for more than two decades and have put the party in this position
 dev ne pitiai ko die saakshaatkaar main kaha ki rahul gandhi ne jaipur main upaadhyaksh banane ke baad sanghathan ke badlaav par kaaphi kuch kaha tha
 If the party had taken a decision on 50 percent of that, then this situation would not have happened
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki party or uske netritv par ek-do darjan logon kaa kabja he
 He said that along with Rahul, Priyanka Gandhi should also work to rid the Congress of these bonds
 adivasee maamalon ke mantri ne kaha ki mahangaai or ghotaalon ke chalate congress nit gathbandhan par saakh kaa sankat paidaa ho gaya tha
 The party and the government could not effectively respond to the propaganda on these issues with their statements and actions
 simandhra main party kii sthiti par gambhir aarope lagaate hue dev ne kaha, congress ko raajnneetik rup se jagan, wiesar congress or unke ek gut ko girvee rakh diya gaya or lagbhag bech hi diya gaya
 Accusing the party of complete mismanagement, Dev said that while the understanding of the political situation was poor, a Congress in-charge of the state also misinformed the Congress president
 unhone kaha ki prabharee dwaara anek muddon par party adhyaksh ko bheje gaye nots kaa bhi asar nahin padaa
 According to Dev, the general perception was very negative
 aam dharna yah rahi ki congress is vishwaas ke saath wiesar congress ke saamne se hat gai ki baad main jaganmohan reddy ko samajha lenge, lekin in chizon se madad nahin mili
 He said that in Seemandhra, the Congress had accepted defeat even before contesting elections
 unhone kaha ki isi vajah se kai vidhansabha kshetron main kamjor ummidavaar khadey kiye gaye or eisisi se milane vaali aarthik madad bhi bahut kam thi
 The Congress did not win any of the 25 seats in Seemandhra region in the Lok Sabha elections and its performance in the assembly elections was also poor
 congress netaa ne kaha ki kerala or karnataka main party ke achche mukhyamantri hai or unhone behatar nattejey die hai
 Of the total 44 seats in the Lok Sabha, the Congress has nine in Karnataka and eight in Kerala

 ) After the death of BCCI President Jagmohan Dalmiya, the new name of Amitabh Chaudhary is emerging among the contenders for this post
 nae adhyaksh ke chunaav ke mudde par bisisiai do faad ho gaya dikhataa he
 To replace the experienced administrator of BCCI, its East Zone units have decided to field their candidates
 isse uttaradhikaar kii ladaai main nayaa mode aa gaya he
 There is every possibility that the units of the former region will present Amitabh Chaudhary, joint secretary of Jharkhand as their candidate for the post of BCCI president
 purv ke paas hai chah votedhyaksh padke liesharad pawaraurarajeev shuklake naamon ko lekar bhi atakalbaaji chal rahi he lekin in donon anbhavi raajnneetigyon ko purv kshetra se prastaav or anumodak milanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 There are six votes in the eastern region which includes Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, Odisha, Tripura and the National Cricket Club (NCC)
 philhal is tarah kii sambhaavna he ki agar shukla yaa pavaar apni ummidavaari pesh karte hai to chunaav karana padegaa or chayan sarvasammati se nahin hoga
 Pawar, former president of the ICC and BCCI, will present his candidature only if he is set to get at least 16 votes and for this he will need the government's support
 vaise bhi anbhavi rajaneta pavaar ko lambii or vistrut charchaa ke baad faisla karne ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Amitabh Chaudharyan, who is an IPS officer, has had informal discussions with each other in the last two days and has concluded that by 2017, the president should be from his constituency
 purv kshetra se bisisiai ke ek sheersh adhikari ne naam jaahir nahin karne kii shart par bataaya, ‘purv kshetra ke rajya chaahate hai ki koi unke kshetra se adhyaksh bane
 At this time, Amitabh Chaudhary fits into it
 ’unhone kaha, ‘vah ipies adhikari hai, jharkhand rajya cricket sangh (jeessie) ko chalaa rahe hai, unhone agm main hissaa liya he or padaadhikari hai
 At least four units of the East Zone will support his candidature
 hamaara kahana he ki 2017 se is pad ke liye purv kshetra se hi koi hona chahie
 If this does not happen, the possibility of election cannot be ruled out
 aapako aashwaasan diya ja saktaa he ki agar pavaar chunaav ladate hai to cab or ensisi (daalamia ke paariwarik club kii tarah) unke paksh main matdaan nahin karegaa
 According to the 'srinivasan' trump card 'holders' sources, former BCCI president n Srinivasan will have a bigger role as he controls 10 out of 30 votes which is one third of the total vote
 koshadhyaksh haryana ke aniruddh choudhary kii tarah amitabh choudhary bhi shrinivasana ke vishwaasapaatr maane jate hai
 In the former region, Srinivasan still enjoys considerable support in the form of Assam, Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand
 shukla ke raah nahin asanshukla ke bhi vibhinn raajnneetik partiyon main mitra hai lekin unke liye bhi purv kshetra se prastaavak hasil karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 He may, however, try to persuade the units of the former region not to field his candidate and support him as the unanimous choice
 is bich bisisiai kii aam sabha kii vishesh baithak prastaavit 15 din se aage khisak sakati he jab tak ki en shrinivasana ke pratinidhitiv par bisisiai ke liye sthiti spasht nahin ho
 Meanwhile, whenever the meeting is held, the Bengal Cricket Association will be represented by its most senior executive Subir Ganguly, who is the joint secretary of the association
 aisa koi niyam nahin he lekin cab main parampara rahi he ki jab adhyaksh nahin rahe to nai niyukti tak do sanyukt sachiv main se jo senior hoga vah baithak main hissaa legaa
 That is why Subir will attend the meeting in place of Sourav Ganguly, another joint secretary

 china kii diwaar- franz kafkauttar ke antim mode par china kii diwaar kaa nirmaan puraa ho gaya tha
 Both parts of the south-east and south-west walls came together here
 tukdon main nirmaan kaa yah siddhanth chote staron par purvi or pashchimi donon hi shram-senaaon dwaara apanaaya gaya tha
 It was done like this: a group of about twenty laborers is made to work to build a fixed length wall, such as a wall of five hundred yards
 isi prakaar ek duusare samooh ko itani hi lambaai par kaam main laga diya jaataa jinka kaam pahile samooh ke kiye kaam ke ant main aakar samaapt ho jaataa tha
 But after meeting the two walls, they were not made to work further from that place, as if the thousand yards wall was completed, but not from where these two groups of laborers were allowed to build a wall in another area nearby
 
 swaabhaavik he is prakaar diwaar ke bich main bade-bade hisse banane se chhutate gaye, jinhen baad main chote-chote tukdon main banaaya jaataa rahaa, yahan tak ki diwaar ke nirmaan kii sarkari ghoshnaa ke baad bhi in khaali sthanon par diwaar banati rahi thi
 The truth is that in the opinion of some people, many such parts were never completed
 yah ek aisa sach tha jo diwaar ke nirmaan ke saath hi kinvadanti ke rup main prachlit ho gaya or jise kabhi bhi jaanchaa-parkhaa nahin gaya tha
 At least by someone who has seen the entire wall with their eyes, the wall was so tall
 saamaanya soch ke anusaar to koi bhi yahi kahata ki adhik suvidhajanak to ek chor se diwaar kaa banaaya janaa hi hota athwa do bhaagon main baantkar lagaataar bananaa hi behatar hota
 Ultimately, this was the truth and it was told to the whole world that the purpose of its construction was to protect the inhabitants of the north
 lekin aisi diwaar bhala raksha kaise kar sakati thi yadi uskaa nirmaan puraa na kiya jaae
 Such a wall will not only be unable to protect, but it will also continue to be a cause of constant danger
 diwaar ke ye bade-bade hisse jinhen marusthal main banaakar chhod diya gaya tha, inhen khanabadoshon dwaara baar-baar gira diya jaataa tha
 Especially because these tribal castes were skeptical about these walls
 or ve apane camp teji se badalte rahete the, tiddiyon kii tarah, isiilie diwaar ke nirmaan ke bare main unhen adhik jaankaree thi, kam se kam ham diwaar nirmaataaon se to kahin adhik,baharhaal or kisi tareeke se diwaar kaa nirmaan sambhav tha hi nahin, is nirnay ko samajhane ke liye pahile kuch baton par aap zaraa gaur kar len - diwaar ko aane vaali sadiyon tak raksha kerani thi, isiilie nirmaan main puri saavdhaanee aprihaary thi, atah pichhali sadiyon ke purakhon ke nirmaan kaary ke anubhavon ke upyog ke saath nirmaataaon main uttardaayitv kaa bhav praathmik aavashyaktaaon main tha
 It was true that men, women and children were put on employment as uneducated, mindless laborers to build the wall
 lekin chaar dinon ke liye aae mazdooron ke upar ek jaankaar kii aavashyaktaa thi, jo nirmaan kaary main praveenta rakhata ho, aisa vyakti jo puure dil se kaam karne or karaane main siddh-hast ho
 And the bigger the responsibility, the bigger the responsibility
 saath hi aise vyaktiyon kii aavashyaktaa thi jo nirmaan kaary main puraa din or puraa dil lagaakar kaam kar saken, yahi nahin aise logon kii aavashyaktaa badi sankhya main thi
 But this work of wall building was not started without thinking
 pehle pathar ke rakhe jane ke bahut pehle sthapaty kala, visheshkar bhawan-nirmaan kala ko puure china ke vishaal bhu-bhaag main sarvottam gyaan kii shakha ke rup main chaaron ore ghoshit kar diya gaya tha, kyonki desh ko deevaaron se gheraa janaa aavashyak ho gaya tha, iske saath hi anya kalaon ke usee ang yaa shakha vishesh kii puch-parakh thi, jisamen isi vishay se sambandhit sandarbh die gaye the
 i remember well that we children who did not even know how to stand on the right paws right now, we were standing in our teacher's garden - where we were ordered to make something like a wall with round stones, and then the teacher would give up Tightly tied up, hit the wall with full force
 swaabhaavik he diwaar gir gai thi or usne hamen hamaare ghatiya kaam ke liye itane jor se daanta tha ki ham sabhi jor-jor se rote chaaron dishaao main apane-apane maan-baap ke paas bhaag gaye the
 a very common incident but significant because it was a reflection of the spirit of its time
 main saubhagyashaalee tha ki jis samay diwaar nirmaan kaa kaary shuru hua
 At that time, i was twenty years old and had passed the final examination of a low-level school
 maine jaanboojhkar saubhagyashaalee kaha he, kyonki mujhase pehle bahusankhya logon ne samskruti kii ucchtam digriyan uteern kar lee thim, jo unhen praapt ho bhi gai thim, lekin saal-dar-saal unhen apane gyaan ke badale main koi kaam hi nahin mila tha
 As a result, they were somehow cutting their lives, while they had important and beautiful setting plans inside their heads and yet they were drowned in the pit of despair
 kintu unamem se jin kuch logon ko suparvizer ke rup main kaam mila, bhale hi vah unke gyaan kii tulana main nimna str kaa tha, phir bhi ve apane kaam ke prati purna samarpit the
 There were also Rajgir who thought highly and who still had not stopped brainstorming, at least for the construction of the wall
 aise log jinhone pehla pathar neenv main sarkaane ke saath swayan ko hi diwaar kaa abhinn ang sweekaar liya tha
 This class of masons is naturally keen that they should do their work with complete integrity and honesty
 yahi nahin ve puri diwaar ke sampoorn rup se upyukt hone ke liye betaab or baichaiyn the
 There was a lack of patience among the daily laborers, as they were focused only on their daily wages
 ucch shrenee ke suparvijaron ke saath bich ke suparvizer bhi nirmaan ke bahurupi vikaas ko kendra main rakh apane vishwaas ko drudh or ucchstar par rakhaa karte the
 But to encourage his assistant supervisors who were well below his intellectual level, and who considered it a very simple task, it was necessary to find other avenues
 jaise udhaaharan ke liye koi yah aashaa nahin karata tha ki ve ek pathar par doosraa pathar maheenon tak yaa saal-dar-saal rakhte chale jaayenge- ek parvaton se bhare janshunya sthaan main, apane gharon se hajaaron mile dur rahete hue, saath hi is niraashaa ke saath ki yah kathor shram kaa parinaam unke lambe jivan main bhi puraa hone vaala to he nahin
 This thinking slams them into the abyss of despair - as a result it is natural that they would stop doing their work diligently
 is vaastaviktaa par manthan ke uparant hi tukdon main nirmaan kii yojana banaai gai thi
 The wall of five hundred yards was expected to be completed in about five years and in these years the supervisors would have completely lost their power and energy, even forgetting to believe in themselves, that is why their wall and Faith on the world must have been destroyed
 isiilie jab ve hajaar gaj diwaar ke nirmaan ke samaapt hone ke utsav ke josh se bhare, apane nirmaan par garv kar rahe hote the, tabhi unhen dur, bahut dur bhej diya jaataa tha
 On the way, they would see the wall built here and there, the completed wall, they used to come out from the houses of the high officials where they were presented with medals respectfully
 desh ke vishaal bhu-bhaag se mazdooron kii nai sena utsaah se jayakaara karti dekhati jaati thi, jangalon ko katkar deevaaron ke sahare ke liye pedo ko khadaa karnaa dekhati, pahaado kii chattaanon ko todakar diwaar ke liye pathar nikalate dekhati, pavitra sthalon main diwaar kii purnataa hetu kii jaati prarthanaaon ko sunati, or utsaah se bharti aage badhati chali jaati thi
 All these scenes together helped to calm his impatience
 apane gharon main kuch dinon kaa aaraam, jahaan ve kuch dinon ke liye rukate the, unamem nai urja se bhar detaa tha
 The confidence with which their work reports were heard, the confidence with which the peaceful peasants used to assure them of the completion of the wall, made their knot of confidence stronger
 shaashwat ashaavadi bacchon kii tarah ve apane gharon ko alavida kehete the, unke andar ek baar phir desh kii diwaar ke nirmaan main jute jane kii utkar abhilaashaa jaagrath ho jaati thi
 Before the end of the holidays, they used to get anxious to leave and half a village to leave them, they went far away with them only to see their enthusiasm
 banners or scorf hilaate logon ke samooh unhen sabhi sadakon par milte the
 Seeing all this, they used to realize for the first time how great, rich and beautiful their country was
 prayek deshvasi unka bhai tha, jiske liye vah diwaar bana rahaa tha, suraksha kii diwaar or pratidaan main vah aaajeevan abhaari rahegaa, apni har vastu ke liye jo uske paas thi
 Unity! Unity! Adjoining the shoulder, the circle of brothers, the blood communication, which is not confined in just one body, but flows through love and returns from the borders of infinite China
 is tarah khandon main nirmaan kii yah vyavastha sambhav hui, lekin iske atirikt kuch or kaaran bhi the
 It is not useless to stay on this question for so long, it is indeed an important question in the construction of this wall
 bhale hi sarsari taur par yah itnaa mahatvapurn na dikhataa ho
 If i have to tell this thing and make the thinking and feelings of that era understandable, then it would not be possible to discuss this question without taking it seriously, although it is not under my control to go deeper
 sabase pehali baat to yah ki un dinon bebal kii minar ke nirmaan kii tulana main kamjor nirmaan ke bare main sochaa hi nahin jaataa tha
 However, as far as the question of divine consent or permission is concerned and as far as the thinking of humans is concerned, it cannot be more inconsistent with the work, i am saying this because in the early stages of construction a scholar wrote a book, in which He compared the two productions in detail
 pustak main usne yah siddh karne kii koshish kii thi ki bebal kii minar apane uddeshy main asafal un kaarnon se nahin hui thi, jo duniya bhar main batalaaye ja rahe the athwa sweekrut tarkon main se sarvaadhik mahatvapurn kaa to kabhi pataa hi nahin chalaa tha
 His arguments and evidence were not only based on written circulars or reports
 uske anusaar vah swayan us sthaan kaa nirikshan bhi kar aayaa tha or iske baad nishkarsh nikaala tha ki minar isliye apane uddeshy main asafal hui or use asafal hona hi tha- kaaran tha uski neenv
 In this context, our time is quite superior since that time
 hamaare yahan praayah har padhaa-likhaa vyakti hamaare samay main vyavsaayik rup se rajgir he or neenv rakhane main praveen he
 However, he did not want to prove it only to the scholar, because in his opinion the Great Wall would be the only witness in human history, as well as the safe foundation of the new Babylonian tower
 isliye sabase pehle diwaar or phir minar
 At that time this book used to be in every hand, but i confess that i have not yet understood why he thought about the tower
 bhala diwaar jo aadha gola tak nahin banaati, bamushkil chauthai yaa aadha gola, yah kisi minar kii neenv kaise banegi
 This means that it must have been accepted in the spiritual sense itself
 lekin yadi yahi sach tha to phir diwaar banane kii bhala aavashyaktaa hi kya thi, jo puri tarah se saakaar thi, hajaaron-lakhon logon kii zindagi bhar kii mazdooree, khun-pasinaa kii saakaar parinti? saath hi pustak main varnit yojanaon, dhundli-dhundli aspasht-si minar kii yojanaon dwaara vistaar se batalaaya gaya tha ki janata kii shakti or urja ko is mahaan kaary main kaise lagaaya jayega?us yug main logon ke paas is sambandh main ek se ek vicitra vichaar the- scoler kii pustak to ek udhaaharan maatr he- shaayad isiilie taaki bahusankhya log milakar puri shakti se jahaan tak sambhav ho, is ek uddeshy kii purti main jute jaaen
 Human nature is essentially variable
 dhul kii tarah asthir jo virodh kattai bardaasht nahin karata
 If he even binds himself, he immediately starts to open it like crazy
 jab tak vah sab kuch ko cheer-faad na daale
 Whether it is a wall or a bond, even yourself
 sambhav he ye saare virdohi vichaar jo diwaar ke nirmaan ke virodh main khadey ho gaye the, hai command ke man bhi rahe honge, jab unhone khand nirmaan kaa nishchay kiya tha
 i am speaking on behalf of quite a large number here, they do not really know them
 jab hamane hai command dwaara paarit adeshon ko jaanchaa-parkhaa to paaya ki bina hai command ke na to hamaara pustaken padhanaa or naa hi hamaari maanviya buddhi hi paryaapt hoti, jo ham apane chote-chote prayaason se sampoorn kaary ke liye karte rahe hai
 In the command office - where he was and who used to sit there, whoever i questioned, they did not know anything in this regard nor now know - in that office it can be said that every thought of humans And wishes kept revolving there and all their human aims and fulfillments were present there in response
 saath hi vahaan kii khidakiyon se divine duniya ke vaibhav kii parachhaaiyaan netaaon ke haathon main padaa karti thim jab ve apni yojanaon par charchaa kiya karte the
 And that is why those living beyond corruption should know that if the leadership wished seriously, it could go beyond these obstacles, which was constantly opposed to construction, so the rest remains only the conclusion that the leadership deliberately did the clause- The construction was chosen
 lekin khand nirmaan maatr paaliyon (shifton) main hona anupyukt tha
 Therefore, the conclusion comes out that the leadership only wanted something inappropriate - it is a wonder conclusion! This is true and from a point of view a lot can be said
 aaj to is vishay par aaraam se bina kisi chintaa ke koi bhi charchaa kar saktaa he
 In those days, most of the people and even among them the owners of the best minds had a secret secret statement, according to which try to fulfill the command of High Command to its full potential
 lekin maatr ek nishchit bindu tak- iske baad us bare main soch-vichaar puri tarah band kar do
 a note of wisdom and wisdom, which is elaborated in a fable, which people often quoted, avoid further attention, but not because it can be harmful, because it is also not definitive
 Is that he is really harmless
 kya haniprad he or kya nahin kaa prashn se koi sambandh hi nahin he, isliye behatar hoga ki basant ritu main nadi ke vishay main socho
 She keeps on spreading, till she becomes mighty and keeps the earth up to its shores far and wide, but never forgets her direction and continues on, till she meets the sea Does not go where it is welcomed with an open heart
 kyonki vah ek upyukt sahyogi he- isliye kuch dur tak to hai command ke nirdeshon kaa paalan or dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he, lekin uske baad nadi apane kinare tod detii he, uskaa aakaar vilupt ho jaataa he, uski dhara kii gati ko dhimaa kar detii he
 Without worrying about their destiny, they build their own small seas above the earth, damaging the fields and despite doing so, they are unable to maintain their new form for long and keep their old shores He has to get ready to flow between
 garmiyon main bahut se sthalon par use sookhna bhi padataa he
 Naturally, that season also comes - that's why you do not need to meditate on the instructions and rules of high command for a long distance
 ab yah jo lokkatha he iskaa prabhaav diwaar nirmaan par adhik maatra main rahaa hoga, kintu mere vartmaan aalekh ke liye to yah keval simit sandarbh hi rakhti he
 My investigation and discovery is purely historical, for many days no lightning has blossomed nor flashed, because there are no roaring clouds, and so i want to explain the arrangement of this block construction , Which goes much further from there
 jis par us samay ke log santusht ho jaaya karte the
 My ideological capacity is quite limited, but the vast terrain i have to walk on is infinite
 yah mahaan diwaar kisase raksha ke liye banaai gai thi? uttar ke nivaasiyon ke viruddh! ab main to china ke dakshin-purv kaa hoon
 No person of the North can become dangerous to us
 ham puraani pustakon main padhate hai, un krurataaon ke bare main jo unhone apni prakruti ke chalate kii thim, jinhen shant pedo ke neeche baith padhate hue ham lambi saansen lete hai
 His realistic portrayals by the artists tell us the big pointed teeth of these devil faces with open mouths, their half-eyed eyes that are already ready to swallow prey into their jaws
 jab bhi hamaare bachche shaitani karte hai, ham unhen ye chitra dikhalaate hai or ek nazar padate hi ve rote hue hamaari banhon main samaa jate hai
 Apart from this, we do not know anything about the emigrants
 hamane unhen dekha nahin he or yadi ham gaanvon main rahe aate hai to unhen kabhi dekhenge bhi nahin, bhale hi ve apane junglee ghodon ko teji se daudaate sidhe kyon na hamaari ore aawein
 Even then, our country is very vast and will not allow them to reach us, their destination will disappear in the empty air
 yadi yah sach he to phir bhala hamane apana ghar kyon choda, jharanon ko unke pulon ke saath, apni maataaon or pitaaon, apni subakati patniyon, apane bacchon ko jinhen hamaari aavashyaktaa he
 Why do we go to train in far-flung cities, while our imagination takes us too far from where the wall is
 kyon? hai command ke liye prashn
 Our leaders are well aware of our nature
 bhale hi ve vishaal samasyaon ko le chintit hon, hamaare bare main ve jaanate hai, hamaari choti-choti aakankshaon ko
 They see us sitting in their small huts, agreeing and disagreeing with our evening prayers, which the bourgeois of the house keeps repeating among the family
 yadi mujhe apane is prakaar ke vichaar prakat karne kii anumati he to main yahi kahoonga ki meri raay main hai command pracheen kaal se astitv main he, vah yon hi bula nahin liya gaya he, jaldi se ikatthi kii gai mendereen; chini bhashaa ho jo kisi ke sapane par charchaa ke liye bulaai ho, or utani hi jaldi se use barkhaast kar diya jaataa he, taaki usee shaam logon ko dhol bajaakar bistaron se uthaa diya jaataa he
 To do the work according to the decision, no matter what it is, it must be a tail star, which has come out in honor of God
 jisane maalikon kaa ek din pehle hi mahatvapurn kaary kiya ho or duusare hi din kisi andhere kone main dhakke or laathiyaan maar-markar dhakel diya gaya ho
 That too, even though the last part of the last star is not lost before it is lost
 main vishwaas karata hoon ki hai command kaa astitv anant kaal se he or usee tarah se unka diwaar banane kaa nirnay bhi
 Now it is their ignorance that the northerners think that because of them the wall is being built
 anjaan eemaandaar samraat jisane kalpana kii ki usne nirmaan kaa aadesh diya tha
 The busy Rajgir in the construction of the wall is well aware that there is no such thing, besides this, we always keep our tongue closed
 diwaar ke banate samay se aaj tak maine swayan ko jatiyon ke tulanaatmak itihaas ke ekmaatr kaam main vyast rakhaa he- kuch prashn aise hai jinhen koi chaahe to uski haddiyon kii majja tak pahunch saktaa he, jaise ve hai, thik isi vidhi se or maine khoj liya he ki ham chiniyon main kuch lok or kuch rajnatik sansthaayen hai, jo apni vishistataaon main spasht hai, or kuch anya duruhata main vishisht hai
 The intense desire to know the reasons for these oddities occurred, especially later
 ghatnaayen mujhe sadaiv chidhaati rahi hai or abhi bhi chidhaati hai or diwaar nirmaan bhi isi samasya kaa ang he
 The most difficult institution you know here is the empire
 peking kii rajkeey court main swaabhaavik he is vishay main paryaapt spashtataa milti he, haalaanki vah bhi yatharth se kuch adhik hi bhraamak he
 At the same time, political-law and law teachers of High School believe that they are knowledgeable in this subject and have so much power that they are also able to impart that knowledge to their students
 jitna adhik koi samaaj neeche str ke skulon main jaataa he, vahaan swaabhaavik rup se aise shikshak or chaatr milte hai, jinako apane gyaan par sandeh bilkul bhi nahin hota he or ek satahi dikhaawati-si samskruti kramshah akaash kii oonchaai tak jaati dikhti he
 Anything that revolves around rules, which have been discovered in people's minds for centuries
 niyam yaa aadesh, apane ajar-amar satya, jisamen se kuch bhi kam nahin hua he, lekin ve shaashvat rup se sadaiv sandehon ke kohre main adrishy rahe hai
 But this is the question of the empire which in my opinion should be asked to the common people, because they are the ones who are the last refuge of the empire
 yahan, main sweekaar karata hoon ki main keval apane janm sthaan ke vishay main hi eemaandaaree se kah saktaa hoon
 Apart from natural deities and their rituals which keep the whole year filled with beauty and sweet changes, if there is any matter of our concern then they are the emperor
 lekin vartmaan samraat ke prati nahin, yaa phir ham vartmaan ke bare main vichaar karte yadi hamen pataa hota ki ve koun hai, yaa unke sambandh main kuch tathyon se parichit hote, sach yahi he ki utsukata hi he, jisamen ham sadaiv vyast rahete hai- ham har sambhav prayaas karte hai
 To get information and information about this subject, even if they are not met by pilgrims, because they have traveled to a wide area, or from nearby or distant villages, or from sailors, because they have not only our waterfalls Has crossed even the holy rivers
 dher sari suchnaayen or samachar ek vyakti ko milte hai yah sach he, lekin kuch bhi nishchit tathy ekatra nahin kar paata
 Our country is so vast that no legend can judge with its vastness
 swarg (akaash) use naap nahin saktaa or peking to usamen maatr ek bindu hi he, or samraat kaa mahal bindu se bhi chota
 On the other hand, as far as the Emperor is concerned, he is the most powerful of all religious political classes in the world, i accept this
 lekin vartmaan samraat hamaare- aapke jaisaa ek vyakti he, jo palang par hamaari tarah hi letata he, jo ho saktaa he vishaal ho yaa phir yah bhi sambhaavna he ki vah sakara or chota ho
 Like us, he sometimes pulls himself up and when he gets tired, he even takes a beautiful carved mouth
 lekin is sabakaa hamen bhala pataa kaise chalegaa-hajaaron mile dur dakshin main tibet kii parvat shrinkhalaaon kii simaaon ke paas? or iske saath hi jo bhi jowar-bhaate vahaan uthte hai yadi ve hamaare paas tak pahonchte bhi hai, to bahut der se pahonchte hai or ham tak pahunchne ke pehle hi lupt praayah ho chuke hote hai
 The Emperor is always intelligent but still ambiguously surrounded by courtiers and nobles - disguise and hostility in the disguise of servants and friends - who exert antagonistic pressure on the power of the empire and constantly wield virulent arrows to overthrow the emperor
 samrajya amar he, kintu samraat swayan ladkadhaata he or singhaasana se utaar diya jaataa he
 Yes, the truth is that the empire eventually sinks and breathes its last in the murmur of death
 in sangharshon or pidaaon se janata kabhi parichit nahin hoti
 Like the hazy visitors, like strangers coming into the city, standing on the side of a crowded street, chewing food brought along, while their rulers at the crossroads of the city very far in front of the same area Is being hanged ek niti katha he jo is puri sthiti ko bahut acchhee tarah samajhaati haih samraat ne, is katha ke anusaar, ek sandesh tumhaare paas bheja, ek sidhe-sade naagarik ke paas, samrajya ke suraj ne apane vishaal desh ke bahut dur, behad dur sthit mahatvaheen chaaya ke paas, samraat ne apni mrityushyya se keval aapke paas sandesh bheja
 He ordered the messenger to sit on his knees on his bed, and then he whispered the message
 phir usne jor dekar sandesavahak se kaha ki jo bhi sandesh usne abhi batalaaya he, vah uske kaanon main dohraye
 After listening, he nodded and decided that the message was correct
 aapane dekha na ki apni mrityu ke anginat darshakon ke bich- jahaan sabhi baadha daalane vaali deevaaron or avarodhakon ko gira diya gaya tha or unchi-chaudee sidhiyon par samrajay ke sabhi rajkumaar ek gheraa banaae khadey the- in sabake saamne usne apana sandesh suna diya
 The messenger immediately set out on his journey, a fit, tired man - now moving his right hand, then to the left, so he went on his way
 jahaan bhi use virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa, usne turant apane seene kii ore ishaara kar diya, jahaan surya kaa chinh chamak rahaa tha
 Shortly, the path was made easier for him, which is not available to anyone else
 lekin jansankhya itani adhik he ki unki sankhya kaa kahin koi ant hi nahin he
 If he had reached the open fields and fields, he would have walked so fast and without doubt very soon you would hear the sound of his fist at your doors
 lekin aisa hota nahin he- uski shakti bahut jaldi hi ksheen hone lagati he, lekin vah mahal ke aantarik hisse ke galiyaaron main kisi tarah rasta banaata chalata jaataa he, jiske ant main vah kabhi bhi pahunch hi nahin paaegaa or yadi vah safal ho bhi jaataa he, to bhi kuch hone vaala nahin he
 He will have to fight a fight in the middle of the stairs and even if he succeeds, there is nothing to gain
 abhi darbaron ko paar karnaa he use, darbaron ke baad doosraa bahari mahal or phir ek baar sidhyaan or darbar or phir aage ek or mahal or is tarah hazaron varshon tak yahi anathak kram or yadi antatah vah bahari daravaajon ko todakar nikal paane main samarth hota he- lekin nahin, yah kabhi nahin hoga- samrajya kii rajdhani uske saamne hogi, duniya kaa kendra, apane kooday-karkat se fatne kii had tak bharaa
 From here, no one can go on fighting and fighting, even by taking the message of condolence of the deceased
 isliye behatar yahi he ki tum suraj dhalate or shaam ke utarate samay khidki ke paas baitho or swayan uskaa sapana dekh lo
 So in these circumstances, amidst so many disappointments, by keeping hope alive, our people respect the emperor
 ve yah bhi nahin jaanate ki koun samraat rajya kar rahaa he, yahi nahin unke man main rajvansh ko lekar bhi sandeh hote hai
 Adequate detail in schools is taught in detail about the dynasties and their superiors, including dates, but there is an all-time uncertainty in the relationship that even the best scholars get caught up in its confusion
 pataa nahin kab ke mar-khap chuke samraaton ko hamaare gaanv main rajgaddi par baitha diya jaataa he or ek jo maatr geeton main hi jivit he, abhi kuch din pahile uski ghoshnaaon ko puja sthal par padhaa gaya he
 Wars that are buried in ancient history have only recently occurred to us, and one's neighbor can be seen reciting his news with a glowing face
 samraaton kii raniyaan, jinhen chatur-chaalaak darbari, rajasi reeti-rivaajon dwaara pathbhrasht praayah hi kar liya karte hai, jo mahatvakankshaon se mutiyaati daihik kaamanaayon main asanyamit or ghor laalchee hone ke saath apni ghrunit aadaton main magan rahi aati hai
 The deeper they are buried in their time, the deeper their actions are painted and with painfully long sighs our villagers finally hear how thousands of years ago an empress, in his days of famine, The husband had blood transfusions
 aap samajhe na, ki hamaari janata apane vigat samraaton ke saath kaisaa vyavhaar karti he, kintu vidmbana yah he ki ve jivit shaskaon ko bhi mrit samaj lete hai
 If once, just in the life of a man, once a state official on his provincial tour, do not deceive us into our village by deceit, and make some announcements on behalf of the government or check the tax list, or the school Take the child's test or ask the priest about our activities and then before he sits in his palanquin and collects his conclusions in front of the gathered villagers The words of the warnings will form - the smile will float on everyone's face, everyone will look at their neighbor with a thief and bow down to the waist with their children so that the authorities are telling about the deceased as if he were Do not be alive, while their emperor has already died, his dynasty has ended
 acha-bhala adhikari uske bare main ham se vastav main majaak kar rahaa he, lekin ham kuch aisa vyavhaar karenge jaise hamane is par dhyaan hi nahin diya ho, taaki uskaa apmaan na ho
 But we do not sincerely and honestly obey anyone other than our current ruler, because doing so would be a punishable offense
 -or adhikari kii palki ke vidaa hote hi, vah uth khadi hoti he gaanv ke shaasha kii tarah koi bhi ek akruti aakasmik rup se ullas se bhare us kalash kii tarah jo pahile hi dhul main mil chukaa he
 Thus, our people have no effect on any revolution or rebellion in the state, nor any contemporary war
 apni yuvavastha kii ek ghatana mujhe yaad aa rahi he
 There was a rebellion in our neighborhood, though in a far-off province
 kis kaaran hua tha, ab yah to mujhe yaad nahin he or phir aaj iskaa koi mahatva bhi nahin he
 Reasons for rebellion can be found here any day, you know how quickly the public gets excited
 haan, to ek din vidrohiyon dwaara vitarit ek kaagaj mere pita ke ghar main ek bhikhaari lekar aayaa, jo us praant se hokar aayaa tha
 It was the day of the banquet, our rooms were filled with guests, the priest sat on the main stool and read it
 ekaek sabhi hansane lage, vah kaagaj kaa tukdaa fat gaya, bhikhaari ko jise aavashyaktaa se adhik bheekh mil chuki thi, ghunson-thappadon se maar-markar kamare se baahar nikaal diya gaya or mehmaan suhaavne din kaa anand uthaane teetar-bitar ho gaye
 Why did this happen? The local language of the province of that neighborhood is quite different from our own language and it also falls into the language of writing, which contains our archaic sense
 abhi bamushkil se pujari ne do panktiyaan hi padhi thim ki hamane apane nishkarsh nikaal liye the
 The oldest history that was told to us long ago, the old wounds which have dried up long ago
 haalaanki aaj samaran karte hue aisa lagata he- vartmaan jivan kii vibhatsata ko bhikhaari ke parche main likhe shabdon main akatya rup se varnan kiya gaya tha- jise sun ham sabhi hans pade the or sir hilaane lage the or aage sunne ko katai taiyaar na the
 We are so eager to forget our present
 is sabko dekh yadi koi yah nishkarsh nikaale ki vastav main hamaara koi samraat he hi nahin, to vah satya se dur nahin he
 It has to be repeated again and again
 sambhavtah hamaari janata se adhik samraat kii swamibhakt janata or kahin nahin hogi, visheshkar dakshin main, kintu samraat hamaari vishwasaneeyata se koi laabh nahin uthaate
 True sacred dragons; Python - stands on a pillar at the end of our village and from the earliest times of human memory, he has been throwing his flames full of flames in respect to peaking, but Peking compares our world to our villagers
 i am more conservative
 kya kahin bhi aisa gaanv hoga jahaan makaan ek-duusare se satakar bane hon or saare khet makaanon se bhar gaye hon-hamaari pahari par khadey ho badi dur tak chaaron ore nazren ghumaakar koi bhi is baat kii tasdik kar saktaa he
 And can these houses be filled with so many people day and night? It is more difficult for us to draw a picture of such a city, than to believe that Peking and the Emperor are one, must say a cloud that has been traveling comfortably under the sun for ages
 ab aisi raay ke uparant nikaale nishkarshon ke baad jivan to purnatah swatantra or amaryadit hi hoga
 Although not in any way immoral
 maine apni yatraaon main itane shuddh naitik mulya nahin paae hai, jitne hamaare apane gaanv main hai
 But in spite of this, a life which is not affected by contemporary rules and works which only accept the ancient rules and dangers
 main vistrut rup se samanyikaran nahin karnaa chaahoonga or naa hi jor dekar kahoongah ki mere praant ke anginat gaanvon kaa haal-hawaal kuch aisa hi he, china ke paanch sau praanton kii tulana main kam
 But perhaps after reading many articles and my personal experiences in this subject, i can say emphatically - in the construction of the wall, especially in which human power and energy has been invested, there was an opportunity to understand the souls of all the provinces
 On the basis of this, i can probably assert that the present attitude towards the emperor is generally in the form of eternal Is our own village
 ab meri aisi koi ichha nahin he ki is vichaar main nihit satya main koi parivartan karuun, varan iske vipareet sach to yah he ki iskaa praarambhik uttardaayitv to sarkaar kaa hi he, jo duniya main sabase pracheenatam samrajyon main se ek he or jisane iske vikaas main koi safalataa nahin pai he tathaa viksit karne ko nakaara he, jisamen samrajya ko ek sanstha ke rup main viksit kiya jaataa ki uski karypranali sidhe bina baadhaon ke desh ke sarvaadhik dur sthit gaanvon tak pahunch jaati
 On the other hand it is also true that the public is lacking in imaginative ability and confidence, which would have enabled him to awaken the stagnation of the Peking Empire and inspire his present realities to come from his chest
 janata jo isse adhik kii kaamana nahin karti ki kam se kam use sparsh to kiya or phir marane ke liye chhod diya
 This notion is not a fixed quality
 phir bhi yah mahatvapurn he ki yah durbalata hi hamaari janata kii ekta ko sarvaadhik rup se prabhavit karti he
 If anyone dares to say that in the land in which we live, then to establish a defect here will not only mean denial of our conscience, but it will be worse to deny the land under our feet

 philhal company ne bharat main is nae divaais kii lonching ke sandarbh main koi jaankaree nahin di he, lekin ummid he ki ise april kii shuruyaat yaa march ke ant tak launch kiya ja saktaa he
 It is expected that the 7 Pro will not be launched along with the Note 7
 maharashtra main 25 saal purana bijepi−shivasena or doosraa 15 saal purana congress−ensipi gathbandhan dagamagaa rahaa he
 The state is scheduled to vote on October 15, but there is no seat sharing among coalition partners
 bijepi is baar 288 vidhansabha siton main se 135 siten chaah rahi he
 At the same time, Shiv Sena is ready to give only 119 as before
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne pehali baar saaf or spasht kah diya he ki itani siten nahin de sakate
 There is a difference of opinion about the seats in both the alliances, there is also bitterness over the post of Chief Minister
 aaj bijepi ke maharashtra prabharee rajeev pratap rudi or uddhav thakare kii baithak honi thi, jo nahin hui
 This time Shiv Sena wants the post of Chief Minister
 uddhav thakare apane liye ye pad chaahate hai
 In Maharashtra, Shiv Sena was considered the elder brother of the BJP, but now the situation has changed
 saal 2009 ke chunaavon main bijepi ne shivasena se zyada siten hasil kii
 The BJP won 46 of the 119 seats, while the Shiv Sena, which contested 160 seats, won 44
 is vajah se leader of apojishan kaa pad bhi bijepi ko gaya
 Now there is a BJP government at the Center
 narendra modi kii lahar he
 In such a situation, the BJP wants to change its role in Maharashtra
 kuch dinon pehle uddhav thakare ke bulaave par hi amit shah unase milane panhuche the, khud se nahin gaye the
 It is clear that the BJP suffered a major setback for Gopinath Munde's passing
 bijepi unhen siem candidet kii tarah project karnaa chaah rahi thi
 With his departure, many contenders for the post of Chief Minister have been raised in BJP
 pareshaani bijepi ke liye or bhi he
 Nitin Gadkari once paid attention to Raj Thackeray in place of Uddhav
 tab ise lekar itnaa hangaamaa hua ki unako apane kadam waapas khinchne pade
 At one time there was a discussion of the closeness of Narendra Modi and Raj Thackeray
 ab 17 sitambar ko bijepi ke adhyaksh amit shah thos baatcheet ke liye mumbai panhuch rahe hai
 He can also meet Uddhav here
 18 or 19 ko unki maharashtra main alag-alag sabhaae hai
 There is also tension in the Congress NCP
 aaj kuch der pehle ajit pavaar ne siton ko aadhe main baantne kii vakaalat kii he
 In the year 2009, the Congress fought on 170 and won 82
 vahiin ensipi 113 par ladi thi or 62 jiti thi
 Recently, Sharad Pawar also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unki gupt mulaakaat kii khabaren bhi charchaa main ai thi
 There was a news of him changing his face
 ab bhale hi congress−ensipi kii body language par haar ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai, lekin mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan kii saaf chhavi kuch raahat detii he
 Even though Congress may not benefit much from this, Uddhav Thackeray of Shiv Sena today attacked the CM in the face and said that he is like a patient in ICU
 aadhi neend main kaam karte hai
 He had no experience, only got the post of CM by the grace of Sonia Gandhi
 ab aane vaale din hi bataaenge ki in gathbandhanon main shaamil koun se dal kitni siten apane hisse main kar paaenge

 chhattisgarh pradesh congress adhyaksh bhupesh baghel rajya main bijepi kii jad khodne main jis teji se jute hai, utani hi teji se sibiai unki giraftaar kaa jaal bunane main juty he
 With the preparations of CBI, it can be guessed that Bhupesh will bring troubles for the new year for Baghel
 sibiai ne unase poochtacha ke liye prashnawali bhi taiyaar kar lee he
 There are about fifteen questions involved, ranging from the role of the alleged dirty CD to its release
 sibiai is baat kaa pataa lagane main juty he ki is sidi ke nirmaan main bhupesh baghel kaa koi haath to nahin
 However, Bhupesh Baghel has made it clear from day one that many people hand him evidence of corruption and black exploits of the leaders of the ruling party due to him being the leader of the public representative and the main opposition party
 taaki unke khilaaf kadi karrwai ho sake
 Baghel has also said that such a dirty CD was handed over to many more important persons by him
 isamen patrkaar bhi shaamil hai
 However, how much CBI will trust these facts of Baghel, it will be known from the authorized replies of Baghel
 27 oktober ko raipur ke civil line thane main rajya ke PWD mantri rajesh munat ne bhupesh baghel or patrkaar vinod verma ke khilaaf iti act kii dhara 67A ke tahat maamla darj karaayaa tha
 This section deals with placing and distributing obscene material by electronic means
 unhone baghel par aarope lagaaya tha ki unhone press conference bulaakar kathith sex sidi banti thi
 Apart from this, another case was registered at Pandri police station in Raipur on the complaint of Prakash Bajaj, close to PWD minister Rajesh Munat
 26 oktober ko darj yah maamla blakemeling or dhamkee dene se judaa he, jisamen patrkaar vinod verma kii giraftaar hui he
 However, Chhattisgarh Police and its SIT are under the question of both the cases
 udhar, apni giraftaar ko lekarchattisgarhpradesh congress ke adhyaksh bhupesh baghel maansik rup se taiyaar najar aa rahe hai
 He said that he will cooperate fully in the investigation
 baatcheet ke dauraan unhone aarope lagaaya ki chhattisgarh sarkaar unhen shadyantra ke tahat fansaana chaahati he, taaki congress ko kamjor kiya ja sake
 He said that in this case the CBI should also take into consideration the facts for which some person made the alleged sex CD of the minister
 unke mutabik mantri rajesh munat ne satta main rah ke bade paimaane par sampatti banaai he
 He fears that sex cds have come out due to mutual rivalry and competition of many big leaders of BJP
 unke mutabik sibiai ko apni jaanch kaa dayera badhanaa hoga
 Only then will the reality of the matter come to light
 sibiai ke aadha darjan afasar dartisidi kandako anjaam tak pahunchane main jute hai
 He has taken the entire investigation of both the case diary and the cases that have taken place so far from the Chhattisgarh Police
 iskaa gahan adhyan kiya ja rahaa he
 a list of more than two dozen questions has also been prepared for questioning journalist Vinod Verma who is lodged in Raipur Central Jail in Judicial Remand
 un logon se bhi sibiai poochtacha karegi jinhone darty sidi cond ko lekar bataur gavaah esaiti ko apana bayaan darj karaae he
 It has also been decided to interrogate these witnesses anew
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is pure maamle main dilli nivasee or sidi shop ke sanchaalak ishu naarang or bhilai nivasee vijay bhaatia ko sibiai sarkari gavaah bana sakati he
 The facts behind it are being given that their testimony will substantiate the case in court
 udhar patrkaar vinod verma kii giraftaar hue 50 din pure ho chuke hai, lihaaja is maamle main chaalaan pesh karne ke liye sibiai ke paas sirf das din shesh bache hai
 The speed with which the CBI is weaving its net about this entire case, and if the circumstances are favorable, it can be guessed that between 22nd and 24th, it will present the challan in the court
 philhal logon kii nigahen sibiai ke kadamon par tiki hui hai
 The CBI will give its seal only at the full deliberation of the Chhattisgarh Police and its SIT, or it will come to reality after a fresh investigation
 yah dekhnaa hoga

 Apart from this, former Indian players Sanjay Bangar and Bharat Arun have been made assistant coaches

 He was removed from the post in 2009
 bisisiai adhikari ne bataaya ki bangar, arun or shridhar agle kuch shrinkhalaaon tak pad par bane rah sakate hai lekin yah unke pradarshan par hi nirbhar hoga
 The status of Guru (teacher) in Indian culture is considered above that of Govind (god)
 lekin jabalpur main ek kalyugi chaatr ne guru-shishy ke pavitra rishte ko hi sharmasaar kar diya

 com / iuvfq2rwam taliban ladaakon ne pakistan ke ashaant mohamand kabyli ilaake main guuruuvaar ko visphot kar chaar skulon ko uda diya
 This is the latest incident in the list of attacks to destroy government-run educational institutions
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki visphoton main koi bhi ghayal nahin hua he
 These explosions were carried out at around 2
30 pm
 gauratlab he ki taliban mohamand agency main 100 se adhik skulon ko nasht kar chukaa he
 This region is included in the semi-autonomous seven tribal districts
 taharik-e-taliban pakistan sah shiksha or sarkari skulon ke paathyakram ke khilaaf he
 He calls it un-islamic
 aatankwaadiyon ne pichley paanch saal main pashchimottar pakistan main saikadon skulon ko nasht kar diya he jinamein zyaadaatar ladakiyon ke skool hai
 As per Prime Minister Modi's promise, 50 days of demonetisation are to be completed in the next few days
 nae saal kii shuruyaat ke saath hi 500 or 1000 ke puraane note mahaz kaagaj kaa tukdaa rah jaaenge
 But the question arises whether it would be so easy for a common man to spend 2 thousand note? Till date the team went to different areas of Delhi and tried to spend 2 thousand note and did a reality check
 sabase pehle itio ke ek atm gaye
 Where a new note of 2 thousand was found and with this note, Chole reached Kulche's hand
 pichley 30 saal se chhole kulche bech rahe vishnu ko jab 2000 kaa note diya to unhone chhole kulche dene se saafe manaa kar diya
 Vishnu said that during the day many people come to the shop who give 2000 notes but are unable to feed due to lack of holidays
 iske baad jhandevalaan se conot place tak auto main safar kiya
 It did not give the auto driver to take 2 thousand notes, so that the auto driver does not refuse to take us
 jab conot place pahunche to kareeb 50 rupee kaa bill bana
 But as soon as he gave the 2000 note to the auto driver, he flatly refused to open it
 auto driver ne bataaya ki dinabhar main kai log 2000 kaa note laate hai jis vajah se graahaki khatm ho rahi he
 Sukhbir Singh's family in Delhi's Connaught Place was buying 2000 notes of pakoras
 sukhbir ne bataaya ki unhen apane parivaar ke liye 4 plate khareednaa he, lekin dukandaar ke paas khule rupee nahin hai
 Sukhbir Singh says that the government should have brought the first 500 note in the market so that the big note can be spent easily
 aisa nahin he ki 2000 rupee ke khule milanaa mushkil he lekin ab bhi chote treders ko is bade note se bada nuksaan jhelana padaa rahaa he
 The 2000 note can be a picture of a changing country, but it is important for the government to increase the number of small notes so that big notes do not become a problem for the people
 cash ke reality check ke liye atm yatranotbandi ke 46 din guzar jane ke baad kya atm cash kii kami ko puraa kar paa rahe hai, ye jaanane ke liye aaj tak kii team ne dilli ke kai ilaakon main atm yatra kii

 Cash was missing from atms of Laxmi Vilas Bank, Corporation Bank, Andhra Bank, Federal Bank, indusind Bank, Syndicate Bank, Punjab National Bank, Punjab Sindh Bank, Yes Bank, Kotak Bank, Central Bank and State Bank of India
 atm yatra jab patel nagar pahunchi to yahaan state bank of india ke atm se ek ladki behad niraash hokar waapas laut rahi thi
 When asked, the girl said that she had been searching for cash with her father in the ATM for the last several hours
 ve jis atm main ja rahi he, vahaan se khaali haath lautnaa pad rahaa he
 After investigation from many areas, it is clear that lack of cash in atms is becoming a big problem for people
 sarkaar ke daawey ke ulat notebandi ke 46 din guzar jane ke baavjood atm cash kii kami ko puraa karne main naakaam rahe hai
 Every year the world celebrates International Labor Day on 1 May and their rights are raised on this day

 The Center did not appeal against the 2013 decision
 - justise eem khanvilakar ne kaha- ye you-turn nahin he
 After the right to privacy, the matter is now left to the discretion of the court

 ham chaahate hai ki agar do ge marine drive par ek-duusare kaa haath pakadakar tahal rahe hai to unhen arest nahin kiya janaa chahie

 isse desh kaa samaaj algebiti samudaay ke logon kii madad karne ko prerit hoga or ye log bhi apni jindagi ullas se ji sakenge
 (photo- Mohsin) Arvind Datar, appearing on behalf of the petitioners in the hearing of what happened on Tuesday, said that the code of homosexuality of 1860 was imposed on India
 yah tatkaaleen british sansad kaa ichha kaa pratinidhitiv bhi nahin karata tha
 He said, 'if a person has a different sexual orientation, then it cannot be called a crime
 ise prakruti ke khilaaf nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Both sexual attitudes and sexual identities are equally facts of one's natural instinct
 ' bench main iklauti jaj indu malhotra ne kaha ki samalangikta keval purushon main hi nahin jaanwaron main bhi dekhne ko milti he
 She was commenting on Datar's homosexuality as normal and non-violent and a form of human sexuality

 Society also looks at them differently
 yon pravriti kaa maamla pasand se bhi alag he
 It is natural
 yah paidaa hone ke saath hi insaan main aati he
 There have been researches on this subject in the Western world
 is tarah kii yon pravriti ke kaaran vanshanugat hote hai
 Section 377 talks about 'natural' sex
 samalangikta bhi prakritik he, yah aprakritik nahin he
 'rohatgi said,' Morals change as society changes
 ham kah sakate hai ki 160 saal puraane naitik mulya aaj ke naitik mulya nahin honge
 Natural sex cannot be defined by the moral values of the British colonists of the 1860s
 pracheen bharat kii naitikta victorian naitikta se alag thi
 'attorney General and Jaitley's Opinion Different from the Government In this matter, Union Minister Arun Jaitley and Attorney General KK Venugopal have expressed a different opinion from the government

 They have separated themselves from Sunavai

 'union Minister Arun Jaitley has already advocated the repeal of Section 377
 jetali ne 2015 main hi kaha tha ki supreme court ko ipisi kii dhara 377 par punarvichaar karnaa chahie
 He said that the Supreme Court should not have changed the decision of the Delhi High Court in the case of homosexuality
 unhone kaha tha ki duniya bhar main log alag-alag sexual orientations ko apana rahe hai
 In such a situation, sending someone to jail on the basis of sexual relations seems like a very old idea

 Leader of the Opposition in Delhi Legislative Assembly Vijendra Gupta said that the government was fighting a losing battle in the High Court and that the Kejriwal government spent crores of rupees to build an army of lawyers on this fight
 vakeelon kii fees par paisa uda rahi he sarkargupta ne aarope lagaaya kidilli sarkaarne centre sarkaar ke notification ko radd karaane ke liye jo cese daayar kiya tha, usamen sarkari vakeelon ke saath hi nami privet vakeelon ko bhi sarkaar kaa paksh rakhane ke liye tainaat kiya, jinaki fees har sunwaayee ke liye lakhon rupee hoti thi
 Gupta said that the government will have to account for these funds, but the Kejriwal government is trying to hide this game of wastage of public money
 vijendra gupta ne maangi thi kharch kii jaankarivijendra gupta ne apane aaropon ke samarthan main teen patr bhi jari kiye hai
 These are the letters in which, as the Leader of the Opposition, he had sought information from the Chief Secretary of Delhi about how many private lawyers were employed in the Delhi government lawsuits and how much they were paid

 There is no work to be done, the government's Manasagupta has written a letter to the Chief Secretary again in June and August, two days before, in which he has also written that the government is deliberately hiding the information about the payment made to the lawyers
 gupta ke mutabik dilli sarkaar kii manshaa vikaas ke kaam karne kii nahin he, balki vahakentre ke saath takaravakarake or court ke mukademon main time kharaab kar rahi he
 That's why a lot is being spent on lawyers

 Accused of spreading confusion, Gupta has also alleged that the Delhi government and the Aam Aadmi Party are now spreading confusion among the people about the High Court's decision that people will have to go to LG for electricity-water problem also

 pdf India has termed the surgical strike by Pakistan in the UN General Assembly and the latest provocative action to raise the Kashmir issue a waste of time and said that it is' a symbol of what takes us all back
 'sanyukt raashtra main bharatki pratham sachiv inam gambhir ne kaha ki sanyukt raashtra main pakistan kii sthaayee pratinidhi maleeha lodhi kii bharat ke bare main mangalvaar ko kii gai baaten 'nakkaarkaane main tuuti' ke samaan hai

 Let me tell you that during the discussion on the annual report of the work of the United Nations in the General Assembly, Maliha Lodhi wandered off her topic and denied that India had carried out the surgical strike in Pakistan and alleged that she (india) would carry out this campaign
 Is trying to provoke the conflict by making false claims and threatening to attack more

 afghanistan kii rajdhani kabul main pakistani mantri ne america rajdoot ko alpagyani bataate hue unka makhul udaaya or unhen 'little pigmi' kii sangya de daali
 More than 17 years after the attack on Afghanistan, the US is looking for a way out
 yah ghatana kshetreey tanaav ke najuk santulan ko rekhaankit karti he
 It began when Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan reportedly suggested the formation of an interim government in Afghanistan to help the dialogue process go smoothly
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri ne somvaar ko sthaneey patrakaron ke saath thodi der hui baatcheet main yah tippanee kii thi
 This comment by Khan sparked controversy in Afghanistan
 afghanistan lambey samay se desh main taliban ke samarthan or uske prashikshan ke liye pakistan kii khufia sevaaon ko jimmedaar tehraata rahaa he
 Afghanistan had recalled its ambassador from Pakistan on Tuesday and the Pakistan Foreign Office on Wednesday tried not to overstate Khan's remarks
 usne kaha ki unke bayaan ko sandarbh se pare rakhkar report kiya gaya
 
 
 This led to an unexpected reaction
 haalanki, iske turant baad afghanistan main america ke rajdoot jon baas ne ek twit kiya jisamen pakistan kii vishwacap vijeta cricket team ke captain ke taur par imran khan ke beete dinon or is khel main kai dhokhadhadi candon main pakistani khilaadiyon ke lipt hone kaa zikr karte hue khan kii ninda kii

 imran khan afghanistan shanti prakriya or uske aantarik maamalon ke saath ball-temper (ball ke saath chhedchhad) ke laalach ko rokna ahm he
 Pakistanis were enraged by a foreign ambassador insulting their leader and he reacted against it on Twitter
 america rajdoot ke is twit par pratikriya dene waalon main khan kii maanavadhikaar mantri shirin maajari bhi thim jinhone apane twit main america rajdoot ko little pigmi kahkar sambodhit kiya
 Shirin tweeted that you are clearly a 'little pygmy', citing US ambassador Jalmay Khalilzad who is leading the peace talks

 Obviously ignorance in your case is certainly no reason to rejoice

 In this case, Tejashwi Yadav attacked CM Nitish Kumar and Deputy CM Sushil Modi by tweeting
 tejasvi ne kaha tha ki mananeey mukhyamantri ji ye kya ho rahaa he mere bihar main? Film Name: Pettakalakar: Rajinikanth, Nawazuddin Siddiqui Director: Karthik Subbarajrating: 3
 5petta film ke nirdeshak karthik subbaraaj ne ek baar bataaya tha ki 'rajnikant ne jab film kii script suni thi to unhone kaha ki kahin na kahin main hi is film ke liye upyukt kirdaar hum
 After watching Petta, it seems that it is completely Rajinikanth's trademark entertainment film
 film ke nirdeshak karthik subbaraaj ne ise ek commercial antertainer banane main koi kasar nahin chodi he
 Relying on Rajinikanth, Karthik appears on the backseat as a director and 'thalaivaa' does not disappoint his fans and his director at all
 kya he film kii kahani ?film kii kahani shuru hoti he jab rajnikant kaa kirdaar kaali ek hostel wardan ke taur par college join karata he
 But Kali is not a common man but on a secret mission
 kahani main mode tab aata he jab kaali kaa saamana upi ke ek netaa se hota he
 Nawazuddin Siddiqui is playing the character
 vahiin unke bete ke kirdaar main vijay setupati hai
 As hostel warden 'kali', Rajinikanth has given excellent performance
 abhinay kaisaa he ?film main rajnikant ke trademark style or unke antertaning andaaz dekha ja saktaa he jiske liye actor deshbhar main mashhoor hai
 Rajinikanth's interactions with the mess manager of the hostel are extremely fun
 iske alaava rajani or simran kii chemistry shandaar ban padi he
 Rajinikanth's scenes with Nawazuddin and Vijay Sethupathi are also worth watching
 'petta' main puri tarah thaliva hi chhaae rahete hai or ye baat baaki kalakaaron kii parformens main bhi jhalkati he
 Nawaz's glare seems to have faded in front of Rajinikanth
 yahi haal vijay setupati kaa bhi he
 It can also be called a weak side of the film that Nawaz's character lacks depth
 haalanki rajnikant akele film ko sambhaal lete hai
 Cinematography by cinematographer Tiru, who has been awarded the Cinematography International Award, is worth watching in this film
 iske alaava film main camera work or production dizine kaa str bhi shandaar he
 The songs and background music in the film also retain the flow of the story, though the songs in one place, slow the story a bit, which is unbroken
 rajnikant ke phens ke liye pongal 2019 behad shubh or khushiyon bharaa hone ja rahaa he
 Petta is Rajinikanth's second film in two months
 isse pehle kaala jaisi raajnneetik or gambhir film main nazar aae the
 But Karthik Subbaraj has produced a highly entertaining film with Rajinikanth featuring action, romance, drama, comedy and emotions and the fans of Rajinikanth should not miss the film at all
 yugers jo apane smartphone ko tiperiter bananaa chaahate hai, unke liye ek acchhee khabar he
 Typing speed on mobile handsets is now on par with physical keyboards due to the younger generation of children
 37 hajaar yugers par kiye gaye ek adhyayan ke anusaar, mobile divaais or physical keybords ke bich typing speed main antar kam ho rahaa he or 10 se 19 saal ke bachche apane mata-pita kii peedi kii tulana main lagbhag 10 shabd-prati minute teji se tip kar sakate hai
 Researchers at Alto University (finland), Cambridge University and ETH Zurich analyzed the typing speed of thousands of users on both phones and computers
 yadi aap mobile par teji se tip karnaa chaahate hai to shodhakarta iske liye do anguuthe kaa prayog karne or shabdon ke auto-sudhaar ko aneble karne kii salaah dete hai
 Anna Fett, one of the researchers and co-authors of ETH Zurich, said, "we were surprised to see that with the help of two thumbs, users write an average of 38 words a minute
 yah physical keybords ke bade paimaane par adhyayan main hamane jo typing speed dekhi, usase keval 25 pratishat dhimi he
 "while some people write up to 100 words per minute on a physical keyboard
 lekin tulana karne par aisa kar paane main kuch log hi sakasham hote hai
 Most people can write 35 to 65 words per minute
 shodh ke lekhakon kaa anumaan he ki jaise-jaise log physical keyboard ke saath kam kushal hote jaaenge or keyboard ke liye smart tareekon main or sudhaar hoga (jaise ki auto-karection or tach model), to kuch samay baad is antar ke khatm hone kii sambhaavnaaen hai

 unka aparaadh yah tha ki unhone dakshin africa main atmasamman kii apil kii thi
 Prime Minister Lui Botha had justified the political decision to send Gandhi to jail for two months, saying that this was the only way to stop Indian "repugnance"
 gandhi ne 16 agast ko johanisburg ke paas fordsburg kii hamidia masjid main koi 3,000 logon ke samooh ko nae avrajan kanoonon ke virodh main apane awasaiya permit jalaane ke liye prerit kiya tha

 Incidentally, Nelson Mandela was also imprisoned in the same prison a few years later

 Later both of them went to "a native asleep in bed" and heard vulgar jokes and opened each other's genitals
 gandhi raat bhar dehshat ke kaaran jage rahe
 a Modh Bania, belonging to a reputed Gujarati family, Gandhi earned a law degree in England but did not get to fight any case in India if he did not change the world in 1893 but change himself by the world Arrived in South Africa
 ek sampann gujarati muslim vyapaaree daavad mohammad ne unhen vahaan bulaayaa tha
 He had sued a fellow Muslim businessman whom an English lawyer was fighting
 mohammad chaahate the ki gandhi unke is mukhya vakil or unke bich anuwaad kaa maamuli kaam karen
 On his first day in Durban court on 23 May 1893, Gandhi gave sufficient indication that he was not going to be a mere advisor in minor disputes
 unhone apni pagadi utaarne se inkaar kar diya or jab magistrate ne unhen baahar nikal jane ko kaha to ve gusse ke saath dan se nikal gaye
 We do not know what Mohammed's reaction was, but the local newspaper The Natal Advertiser had reported the disaster
 chaar din baad usne gandhi kaa ek patr prakashit kiya jisamen unhone akhbaar or shwet samudaay ko bataaya tha ki ek bhartiya kii najar main pagadi pahananaa apmaan nahin balki sammaan jataane kaa pratik he
 Two weeks later, Gandhi was pushed out of the first class compartment of the train in Pietermaritzburg
 or ek kranti kaa beej pad gaya
 Within a month, Gandhi displayed a steely intent and a tendency towards the written word that dramatically changed the world, even in the face of the repressive power that killed him in 1948 by the same people he liberated
 beesvin sadi ke pehle dashak ke aakhir tak vichaarak gandhi ko sangharsh or bauddhik swatantraaa kii khuraaq ne majbootee di thi
 His sprawling home in the city's upper class would have exposed his financial success, but he moved beyond such modest amenities to the dramatic experiments that made him a distinguished leader of his community, and then he became the leader of those Became leaders who were inspired by the ideal of equality between peoples, races and nations
 ve us naitik punarjagran andolan ke swayambhu netaa ke rup main ubhare jo vibhinn dharmon ke bich meljol chahta tha, vah bhi is tarah ki kisi ko apni aasthaa kaa tyaag na karnaa pade
 Gandhi was attracted to the evangelists, who, enthralled by his apparent seriousness, tried to convert him to Christianity
 gandhi ne chaturaai bharaa jawaab diya-chunki hindu dharm main isiyat ke saare siddhant pehle se hi maujuud hai, lihaaja unhen apana dharm chhodane kii koi vajah nahin dikhti
 In retrospect, it is easy to recognize a parallel factor, even though it is not over-emphasized, that a group of white-minded people was also included as a fifth moral pillar in Gandhi's fight against colonial whites
 gandhi ne dharm kii vibhaajankaree rekhaon ke aadhaar par paaramparik rup se bante logon, visheshkar hinduon or musalamaanon main bhi apane anuyaayi banaae
 He came to know how much the Muslims have in mind for Osmania Sultan, the Khalifa of Islam, when he wrote a congratulatory letter from the Muslims on the occasion of change of power in Istanbul
 or unhen yah baat tab bhi yaad thi jab unhone asahyog andolan ke dauraan rashtriya andolan main musalamaanon ko shaamil kiya
 As he later said, "the hindu-muslim problem in South Africa has been solved
" hamen ehsaas ho gaya ki ekadusre ke bagaiyr unka kaam nahin chal saktaa
 He started the Indian Opinion in 1903 to publicize his original ideas
 satyagrah se zyada moulik vichaar doosraa koi nahin tha
 This was an absolutely fundamental political idea, which he called an "insistence on truth" and dismissed "peaceful resistance" as too peaceful
 satyagrah kaa pehla prayog 1908 main us avrajan kanoon ke khilaaf kiya gaya, jisaki unhone ''kaala kanoon'' kahkar ninda kii thi
 Apparently, he had no idea of the irony against the white racism spread around him
 unka naaraa naatakeey tha- karo yaa maro!jab unhone 1919 main satyagrah shuru kiya to usamen uski sidhi anugunj thi
 The movement was about to begin the countdown to the fall of the most powerful empire in history
 unhone us rolat kanoon kaa virodh kiya, jo bharatiyon kaa apmaan karata tha haalanki unhone pratham vishwayuddh ke dauraan europe or africa ke yudhakshetron main british samrajya kii khatir ladaai ladi thi (jisamen gandhi khud vastutah bhartee karne vaale sargent the)
 Gandhi called it the "black law"
 unhone bhartiya musalamaanon ke khilaafat andolan ko aazaadee ke rashtriya andolan kaa hissaa bana diya
 His message to Indians was to know: do or die! His weapon was 'satyagraha', a non-violent weapon that, after its blurry debut in South Africa, slowly became invincible with invisible steps
 unhone jab 1914 main aakhri baar dakshin africa ko alavida kaha to unke virdohi jaan chrishchiyan smats, jo sarkaar ke pramukh maardarshak the or baad main british pradhanmantri winston churchill ke mitra bane, ne kaha, ''vah sant hamaare samudratat se vidaa ho gaya he, mujhe vishwaas he ki vah hameshaa ke liye chalaa gaya he
 "actually, that saint had just focused his attention on the land where he could build an army of satyagrahis
" ve england ke raste bharat lautne ke liye 18 july 1914 ko kep toun main eses kinfons jahaaj par akele nahin savaar hue the
 He was also with Yedi architect Hermann Kallenbach of prussian-lithuanian origin
 jo log unhen vidaa karne aae the unase gandhi ne calenbakh ke kandhe par haath rakhkar kaha, ''main apane saath apane sage bhai nahin balki apane europea bhai ko le ja rahaa hum
 "both brothers wanted to settle in India in the same way they had been living in South Africa since 1908
" agar kismat ne karavat na lee hoti to ve apane is iraade main kaamyaab hote
 He arrived in London the very next day after World War i began, and despite Gandhi's appeals no one could issue a passport to a German
 calenbakh ko oil of main (britain or ireland ke bich ke dweep) main rakhaa gaya, or yuddh ke baad kaidiyon kii adlabadali ke samay germany bhej diya gaya
 He did not meet again until 1937
 gandhi ko apane bhai kii yaad aati thi, or khilaafat andolan ke dauraan ek baar unhone kaha tha, ''mere paas koi calenbakh nahin he!''joseph leliveld ne apni nai kitaab great sol main isi rishte ko kuch is vistaar ke saath bayaan kiya he ki usne gandhi kii chirparichit duniya main sphurtidai safar ko ek galij gali main dulki chaal se guzarana bana diya he
 It is important to point out that Lelyveld, a former journalist who was a reporter in South Africa and India in the sixties and retired as the managing editor of the New York Times, has not revealed anything new
 calenbakh ke dastavej dilli ke rashtriya abhilekhaagaar yaa gujarat ke sabarmati ashram main pade hai
 There is nothing secretive in that, and there is nothing that his contemporary biographers have not seen
 lekin duusare logon ne ashleelata, yaa gaatha main dwiarthi shabd daalane se gurej kiya
 For four decades, the book was in Lelyveld's 'womb'
 yah dukh kii baat he ki unhone ek aisi kriti main ishaaron yaa gupt abhipraayon kaa sahaara liya, jo gandhi par likhi gai pustakon main sammanjanak sthaan hasil kar sakati thi
 Gandhi had the unique courage to rise above secrecy in terms of his sexuality
 unhen yah hakeekat bataane ke liye jeevani kii jarurat nahin thi; unhone yah ek aatmakatha ke jariye bataa diya he, jo unke jivan main itani ahm ghadi par prakashit hui thi jab ve ''satya ke saath prayogon'' ke bare main bilkul spashtvaadi the
 The widespread belief is that the British government, which hated Gandhi, was denied the Nobel Peace Prize; Perhaps he should have given Gandhi the Nobel Prize for Literature in the 1930s, since hardly an autobiography has given such honesty
 manovishleshak or gandhi ke mashr jeevanikar erik arikson ko 1958 main apane gararavayati khyaal ke liye pulitger puraskaar diya gaya; or duusare frydwadiyon ne gandhi kii is spasht sweekaarokti ko saraahaa he ki unamem strainata thi (unki raay main har aadmi main ek strain khubi hoti he)
 But this does not mean that Gandhi was called homosexual
 leliveld ne calenbakh par apane adhyay ko hoshiyaari ke saath 'apper house' naam diya he
 Gandhi used to use the "upper House" jumle for himself and the "lower House" jumle for Kallenbach
 lekin yah jaruri nahin he ki har koi 'apper' or 'loar' kii vyakhya usee tarah kare jis tarah se britain kaa sattadhari varg aton ke khel ke maidan main karata tha
 When Gandhi had spent the night in 1908 trembling with the threat of sexual misconduct, he was living with Kallenbach
 unka nijee jivan pehle hi aparigrah kii ore bad chalaa tha
 In August 1906 he pledged to follow celibacy; Brahmacharya means liberation from libido, so that they can serve their people better
 unka maananaa tha ki veery nasht hone se aadmi kamjor ho jaataa he, or sex se ''mahatvapurn drav kii aapraadhik barbaadi hoti he
 "they became vegetarians, as they believed that milk, milk products and spices (which they liked) had aphrodisiac characteristics
" unhone kaha ki gita ne unhen anand ke liye khaane se roka
 After celibacy Gandhi no longer has a secret
 isi vajah se unhone privesi yaa niztaa tyaag di
 They did not sleep with the doors closed
 sharir kii maalish karaane ke unke kuch shauk ko aasaani se kamechha se joda ja saktaa he, or isamen andeh he ki calenbakh ne unki maalish kii ho
 But if every massage is for sexuality, today no spa will be considered legitimate
 maalish karaane kii gandhi kii chahat yaa enema lene kii unki sanak jaisi aadat calenbakh ke daur ke baad bhi jari rahi
 One side of them was that they punished themselves for internal impurity, including impurity of intent
 isi vajah se unhone satya ke saath apane prayog ke tahat yuvatiyon ke saath sone ke prayog bhi kiye
 It was the self-discipline of the Mahatma, who refused to cover his conscience with the veil of the boring hypocrite
 calenbakh koi pehle europea nahin the jo gandhi ke ghar main rahe
 In 1904 Gandhi met Henry Polak, a 24-year-old journalist who was a vegetarian and fan of Tolstoy, just like him
 1905 main polak mahange ilaake troiville main gandhi ke bade bangale main rahete the
 Pollock got married, probably because they were not paid that way
 lekin is par gaur kiya janaa chahie ki polak dampati ke vivaah ke baad gandhi unke saath aa gaye or polak kii ek santan hone ke baad hi unase alag hue
 It was only then that he started living with Kallenbach
 calenbakh ne apane bhai simon ko, jo us samay germany main rah rahe the, ek patr likhakar gandhi caprabhav ke bare main bataaya
 He wrote that he became a vegetarian two years ago, and gave up sex 18 months ago
 unhone gandhi ke sanyamit bhojan par jor diyah chocolate kaa matlab maut
 It can be argued that due to the omission of sex, both of them got rid of double words in their brotherhood, or perhaps homosexual love
 calenbakh kii shaareerik banaavat is gap ko badhaava detii he
 He was a gymnast, and Gandhi once said that he was trained by international superstar bodybuilder Eugene Sandow
 gandhi kareeb 110 pound or paanch foot saat inch ke the, yani harculis kii tarah katai nahin
 They used the language of love, they were so close that they walked 21 miles together in a day, and were the first to read the manuscript of Hind Swaraj, an early book by Kallenbach
 lekin gandhi ne unhen yah manaane par nirantar zyada vakt kharch kiya ki ve bhogavilas main jeene kii jagah nipat nirdhantaa main jien
 i am of the opinion that Gandhi, who never recovered from this guilt, was in love with his wife Kasturba when his father was battling to death in the room in Kibgal, more interested in a messenger than a lover
 dharmadoot shabd kaa jo sabase uddatt arth ho saktaa he us arth main ve ek dharmadoot the

 In 2014, he contested from his hometown Jaunpur, 150 km from Gorakhpur, but lost
 is baar vah purv kendriya mantri or aakhilesh yadav va mayawati ke gathbandhan ummidavaar rampuhal nishad ke khilaaf chunaav lard rahe hai
 14 months ago, SP-BSP chose Gorakhpur to test their new partnership and they saw its shocking results
 unhone bijepi ummidavaar ko us sansadeey kshetra se haraa diya tha jiskaa pratinidhitiv khud yogi adityanath pichley paanch saalon se kar rahe the
 The same saffron-headed Yogi who became the Chief Minister in the year 2017 of Uttar Pradesh, the most important state of India politically
 gorakhpur up-chunaav main mili haar adityanath ke liye badi vifaltaa thi
 He is also the Mahant of the region's most influential and powerful Gorakhnath temple
 is jeet ne donon purv mukhyamantriyon mayawati or akhilesh yadav main josh bhar diya jo apni chir sthai shatruta ko bhulaakar rajya main bijepi kaa rasta rokane ke liye saath aae hai
 It was argued that if Gorakhpur can be won, then other places with BJP rights can also be achieved
 mayawati-akhilesh ke gathjod ko baadh ke dauraan saanp or nevale jaisaa vinaashkari gathbandhan qaraar dene vaale yogi adityanath ko yah sweekaar karnaa padaa ki unhone apane dushmano kii sanyukt takat or janata ke mood ko kam karke aanka
 After this punishment at the hands of the public, he set out to improve the condition of Gorakhpur, including widening of roads, new manure plants and setting up of sugar mills
 pradhanmantri ne purvanchal ke liye 10 hajaar karod rupee kii aadharbhoot yojanaon kii shuruyaat ke liye apane sansadeey kshetra varanasi ke bajaae gorakhpur ko chunaa or 75 hajaar karod rupee kii pradhanmantri kisaan sammaan nidhi (piem-kisaan) kaa elaan kiya, jiske tahat chote kisaanon ke khate main har saal sidhe 6 hajaar rupee transfar kiye jaaenge
 Political analyst Manoj Singh is very happy with this wind of development
 unke mutabik, "gorakhpur ke chunaavon main vikaas ne kabhi mukhya mudde kii bhoomika nahin nibhaai
 If that were the case, the plight of government hospitals or the lack of weak bridges and means of transport would be heard in the people here
 pichley chunaavon main janata ne yaa to gorakhnath mandir ko vot diya he yaa jativaadee samikarnon ke aadhaar par janadesh sunaaya he
 "there are 20 lakh voters in Gorakhpur with a highly complex casteist structure, with the highest number of Nishad castes (2
 63 lakh voter) log shaamil hai
 This was followed by Dalit (2)
 6 lakh voter) or phir yadav (2
 4 million voters)
 saal 2018 ke up-chunaav main badi sankhya main in jatiyon ke logon or muslim votaron ne aakhilesh yadav ke ummidavaar praveen nishad ko samarthan diya tha
 Praveen Nishad is also the leader of the local organization 'nishad'
 akhilesh yadav kii party ke ek sthaneey netaa tathakthith rup se kehete hai, "praveen nishad kii jeet ke baad nishad party mahatvakankshi ho gai or usne do loksabhaa tikaton kii maang kar daali jise akhilesh yadav ne khaarij kar diya
 "in early April, the Nishad Party said it would tie up with the BJP
 bijepi main shaamil hone kii yah tathakthith yojana akhilesh yadav ke baagi chachaa shivpal yadav ne banaai thi
 But the BJP knew that if it made any Nishad its candidate, it would be around 7 in Gorakhpur
 5 lakh savarna votaron ko kho degi jinamein sabase zyada brahman shaamil hai
 Therefore, he made Ravi Kishan Shukla his candidate
 ( praveen nishad padosi sansadeey seat se chunaav lard rahe hai
 ) Sunil Singh, a senior leader of Yogi Adityanath's Hindu Yuva Vahini, says, "ravi Kishan must have been elected by consensus
 bijepi netritv ne yah sochaa hoga ki apane do kaddavar netaaon murali manohar joshi or calraj mishra ko tikat na dene ke baad agar vah kisi brahman ko ummidavaar banaate hanto brahman samudaay santusht ho jayega
 There is no threat to an actor, a weak politician and an external Chief Minister in Gorakhpur
 " sunil singh 15 saal baad apane guru adityanath se alag ho gaye the or ab vah unke khilaaf prachaar kar rahe hai
 Though 49-year-old Ravi Kishan says that he has come here for a long time, "I want to mature like serious leaders like NT Rama Rao and Vinod Khanna who work for the tired people
" " saal 2014 main piem modi ke kiye vaade ko doharaate hue unka kahana he ki unki yojana ek bhojpuri film studio banane kii he jisase 1 lakh naukariyon kaa srijan hoga
 Coalition candidate Rambhual Nishad told NDTV that he had no worries that he would lose his shine in front of a star rival
 unhone kaha, "mere paas sabhi jatiyon or dharmon se sambandh rakhane vaale samaaj ke vanchit tabakon kaa samarthan he
 "some Nishad Party supporters say that he will vote for Rambhual because BJP did not let him contest from Gorakhpur, the seat of his choice, even after Pravin Nishad was included in the party
 pradhanmantri ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi or gorakhpur main 2019 ke chunaav ko sambhaal rahe sunil oja kaa daawa he ki gaiyr-bijepi partiyaan jati or dharm ko sabase zyada ahmiyat de rahi hai
 According to him, "she is ignoring the people of all these castes who will vote for development
 kalyankari yojanaon kaa sabase zyada phayda dalit or muslimon ko mila he
 "gorakhpur has always been a VIP area for Yogi Adityanath
 is baar yah pehle se bhi zyada mahatvapurn ho gaya he kyonki yaheen mayawati-akhilesh yadav ke behad acolpaneey raajnneetik gathjod kaa janm hua he

 aisa isliye kyonki railway kii taraf se milane vaale khaane par tex dar gata di gai he
 However, the benefit of this facility will be available only to those train passengers, who have to pay for food along with tickets

 After which 5% GST was imposed on food and drink in all mail and express trains
 jabaki rajdhani, shatabdi or duranto main yah vyavastha 16 april se lagu ho gai he
 Whereas till now 18 per cent GST was being charged on food items
 rajdhani, shatabdi or duranto ke yatriyon ko zyada phaaydadarasal, is nai vyavastha kaa sabase zyada laabh rajdhani, shatabdi or duranto main safar karne vaale yatriyon ko hi pahonchega
 Because the passengers traveling in these trains also have to pay for the food at the time of booking the tickets
 ab tak in trainon main uplabdh khan-paan kii chizon par 18 fisadi jiesti lag rahaa tha, jo ab ghatakar paanch fisadi ho gaya he
 This means that now passengers will save 13% tax directly on the tax on food items with tickets
 jisase unhen tikat kii keemat pehle se kam padegi

 On the hot afternoon of June 6, 2014, my car was heading towards Kanth town, about 30 km from Moradabad
 sadak ke donon ore hariyaali kaa dilkash najaara tha
 Many farmers were plucking mangoes from the gardens
 saamne ek bada kasbaa dikhaai diya, najadik pahunchaa, to sadak par police kii bhanabhanaati gaadiyaan or gasht karti police dikhi
 Many policemen were gossip-wrapped
 unke hont paan se surkh laal the
 Was moving forward in a silence-filled market
 dukaanon kii shater par bade-bade taale latake hue the
 It felt as if the whole town is silent
 gaadi khadi kar kai logon se baat kii
 a lawyer who had returned from the court came under my camera and mike, said, "this market is closed since 9 days
 
 
 yahaan badange kaa kaarobaar thap padaa he
 
 
 You will not get milk or vegetables anywhere in the whole city, now either get loudspeakers, otherwise this city will remain closed like this ”

 a day ago, there was a fierce fight between BJP workers and the police, in which 20 people including DM Chandrakant of the area were injured
 bijepi ke kai saansad or vidhayakon ko kanth aane se pehle hi giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 Among those arrested was Sangeet Som, an accused in the Muzaffnagar riots
 vahiin police ne updrav failaane ke aarope main 63 logon ko giraftaar kiya
 The arrested people alleged that they were rung in the police station overnight
 ye sab usee khamosh laudspikar kaa said effect tha
 i also went to meet 'loudspeaker sir' at Akbarpur Chenderi village, one kilometer from Kant
 gaanv kii galiyon main sannata pasra tha
 Hearing the sound of the car, some people peeped through the doors and then the doors closed
 ek chote se shiv mandir main mahant hoshiyarnath apni charpai par so rahe the
 The police was the police in front of the temple
 maine mahant ko hilaayaa, alsaai ankhon ke saath vah charpai par baith gaye
 Put the mic, he said, "the policemen came and forcibly removed the loudspeaker above the temple, while this loudspeaker had been in place for 14 years"
 is gaanv main 80 fisadi muslim, jabaki 20 fisadi hindu rahete hai
 According to the police, there was an agreement among the people of the village that the loudspeaker would ring only on Janmashtami and Mahashivaratri in the temple
 kai saalon se aisa hi chal rahaa tha, lekin is baar mahant ne to laudspikar utaar liya, lekin 16 june ko muradabad se bijepi saansad sarvesh singh ne dubaara ek nayaa laudspikar lagava diya
 When the other community of the village complained to the police, the police came into action and the loudspeaker was removed
 samaajawaadee party ke pravaktaa kii tarah baat kar rahe muradabad ke esaspi dharmendra yadav kaa daawa he, "bijepi yahaan maahaul kharaab karne kii firaaq main he
 
 
 All this is happening at the behest of Sarvesh Singh and this is happening because the by-elections are going to be held in Thakurdwara assembly constituency ”
 sawaal ye hai ki jab police ko puri sajeesh kii kahani pataa thi, to phir in netaaon ke khilaaf karrwai kyon nahin kii gai
 The SSP knows this much, but does not know who the SDM is in their area
 hangaame ke dauraan esaspi ne bheed main maujuud apane ilaake ke esadm kii jamkar dhunaai kii or phir baad main pahchaan na paane kii baat kahkar 'sori-sori' bolte rahe
 Well, met the area's MP Sarvesh Singh
 saansad ji ne kaha, "meraa is maamle se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 
 
 i have not been to Akbarpur Chenderi village for 30 years
 kamaal he sarvesh ji kai baar vidhayak bane, saansad bane or 30 saal se gaanv gaye hi nahin! vot maangane to gaye honge
 It was clear that this entire matter is a political agenda for everyone
 'samaajawaadee' police or prashasan ke liye bhi tathaa bijepi ke liye bhi
 If the administration wanted, it could have ended the matter by persuading the villagers through dialogue
 haalanki police kaa daawa he ki gaanv kaa koi bhi shaks hangaame main shaamil nahin tha, jo giraftaar hue ve bhi kasbe ke baahar ke log the
 i believe that many cases are above the law, especially matters related to faith and religion, and in such cases can only be increased by moderation and negotiation

 jiske baad 9 may 1914 ko america president woodrow wilson ne ek kanoon paas kiya tha jisamen likhaa tha ki may maheene ke har duusare ravivaar ko madard de manaaya jayega
 After passing the law, Mother's Day began to be celebrated on the second Sunday of May in America, India and many countries
 lekin euke madard de march ke maheene main 6 march ko manaaya jaataa he
 Left the job, kept the son away and Anu from Sonepat is celebrated in other rankin countries such as Mother's Dehabharata - Here mother has many names like xxwrep 7 mother, mother
 is din maa ko sammaan or khushi dene ke liye log gifts, cards yaa koi special tohfa dekar celibratt karte hai
 Mother's Day is very popular among the people of China

 Have you thought about how your partner must have felt when you first undressed in front of them
 mahila or purush donon kii hi apane-apane partner ke bare main kai phantsij hoti hai
 When you take your clothes off for the first time in front of your partner, sex expert Terese Cox has told about 5-5 points on this subject
 unka kahana he inamen se sabhi baaten aapke partner ke dimag main aa sakati hai or kam se kam ek to jarur aegi
 What Women Think: They usually check your body: Women also look at their partner's body like men
 wo najaron hi najaron main apane partner ko puri tarah se pard leti hai
 This does not mean that if you do not have 6 packs, then they will not give you a price
 vah tulana karne lagati hai ki body beautiphul comptishan koun jitegaa:mahilaayein dekhati hai ki kahin unka body shape mujhase acha to nahin he
 If this is the case then it seems to them to be a big challenge
 phir unhen lagata he ki he bhagwaan kaash maine wo sab kuch nahin khaaya hota
 His feet are more in shape than my feet
 wo to yahaan tak sochane lagati he ki mahilaon kii tarah purush ke bams bhi kyon nahin latakate
 She also looks at the size of your penis: after this, the attention of women goes towards the size of your penis
 lekin yahaan maamla thodaa ulta he, jahaan purush sies chota hone kii kuntha paalate hai vahiin mahilaayein bada sies pasand nahin karatin
 There is absolutely no truth in the fact that women prefer men whose penis size is larger
 isse kai baar sex takalifdeh or dardanaak ho saktaa he
 So if your penis is of average size then you can be relaxed
 yahaan tak ki agar aapako lagata he ki aapkaa sies chota he to bhi pareshaan hone kii jarurat nahin he
 Just your tongue should be good
 wo dekhati hai ki aap uttejit hue hai yaa nahin:apane saamne neude mahila ko dekhakar bhi aap uttejit nahin ho rahe hai to mahila ko lagata he ki yah uskaa dosha he
 If this is the case, you should immediately tell your female partner that it is not at all that you do not have feelings for them
 wo dekhati hai ki unhen nagn dekhakar aapaki pratikriya kya hoti he?asal main ye baat mahilaon ko sabase zyada chintaa detii he
 The best response is that women feel that their partner looks at their whole body with sexuality and that there should be such expressions on their face
 
 
 mahilaayein kya nahin dekhti?vaise to aisi bahut kam chijen hai jo mahilaayein nahin notice karatin
 But they have nothing to do with whether you have mole on your back or not
 aapane koun se brands kaa undervier pahana tha, jise aapane abhi-abhi utaar diya
 How much hair do you have on your body etc
 purush kya sochate hai:yahuu
 
 
 Now i will have sex! If a woman nude is standing in front of you, it means you are going to have sex with her soon
 aapkaa partner is bare main sochakar hi prafullit ho uthta he
 But soon it turns into a different idea, which is not so pleasant
 kya mere ling kaa aakaar thik he?mahilaon ke vipareet, purush kaa privet part jald hi uttejit ho jaataa he
 That is why he starts finding feelings on your face in insanity fast, so that he can find a solution to this misconception
 agar use lagata he ki is maamle main vah thik he to turant hi use ek or shankaa gher leti he
 Will i be able to perform? Women can also display showmanship, but not men
 agar aap pehali baar sex karte hai to yah behad uttejk hota he, lekin sara dabaav purush par hi hota he
 He looks at your breast: After getting over all these things, finally, his attention goes to that which is in front of him
 ab samay bra on or bra of test kaa aata he
 Although your cleavages in bras look nice and exciting, are all these enough to add excitement to them
 phir unka dhyaan neeche kii taraf jaataa he:ye bahut hi khaas samay hota he
 Because even if you have waxed, trimmed, have a little hair or been thoroughly cleaned
 aap pehle se hi unki pasand ko nahin jaan saktin
 Some men want their partner's private part to be perfectly clean, while some will like the trim
 phir wo aapke body confidence kii pariksha letaa he:agar aapkaa ek haath turant upar jaakar breast ko doosraa neeche kii taraf jaakar privet part ko dhak detaa he to use samaj aa jaataa he ki use saamaanya sex milane vaala he
 Whereas if you stand in front of him with confidence, then he starts thinking about you and he feels that he is going to have a great experience
 kis taraf purush kaa dhyaan nahin jaataa:is dauraan purush kaa dhyaan bilkul bhi aapke vajan par nahin jaataa
 Not only this, but apart from the breast size, his attention is not on your body size
 jab tak aap neude ek duusare ke saamne khadey rahete hai, vah idia laga letaa he ki use kya dekhne ko milane vaala he
 Yes, if there is mischief in him, then he will definitely want to see if your breasts and bums jump when you walk
 dilli get ke paas bane parsi agni mandir main anya dharmo ke logon ke saath bhedbhaav baratane or unhen mandir ke andar nahin jane dene ke aarope kaa fire temple trust dilli parsi anjuman ne khandan kiya he
 The trust has filed an answer in the Delhi High Court saying that those people do not discriminate against anyone
 sirf ghayal vyakti, jiske sharir se khun nikal rahaa ho yaa phir masik dharm se guzar rahi mahilaon ko mandir main pravesh karne kii anumati nahin di gai he
 In its reply to the court, the trust has defended that all these rules and conditions regarding entry into the temple are for everyone, even if it is not a Parsi

 The petitioner has accused the administration of the Parsi fire temple that people of other religions are not allowed to enter the temple except Parsi

 The Parsi fire temple has also said in its reply that it does not get grant from anyone to take care of the temple

 In such a situation, it is wrong to talk about not allowing any non-parsi to go to the temple

 Sanjeev Kumar, the lawyer who filed the petition, has filed the petition alleging that Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs etc
 are not allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum of the fire temple near the Delhi Gate Metro station
 yah naslbhed, asprishyata or sampradayikta failaane jaisaa he
 He said that he himself went to the temple, but he was not allowed to go to the sanctum sanctorum
 tab unhen is sab ke bare main pataa chalaa
 The petitioner also claims that a notice has been placed outside the temple stating that people of other religions are not allowed to enter the fire temple

 Earlier, the court had sought answers from the central and state government and the police on a petition allowing entry of women at the tomb of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya Dargah

 After the fifth phase of the Lok Sabha elections, Uttar Pradesh has now become a political battleground in Purvanchal
 agle donon charan kii ladaai centre kii satta kaa bhavishya tay karegi
 In such a situation, the BJP, Congress and SP-BSP alliance are putting full force
 sattadhari bijepi apana kila bachaane main juty he to congress nae raajnneetik sameekaran ke jariye purvanchal main damdaar vaapasi kii koshish main he
 While the SP-BSP alliance faces a major challenge of transfer of their votes, due to which Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati both leaders have devised a new strategy
 loksabhaa chunaav ke chhathen or saatven charan main uttar pradesh kii 27 siton par voting honi hai, jinamein se bijepi ko 26 or sapa ko ek seat 2014 main mili thi
 In this Lok Sabha election, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and BSP president Mayawati have prepared a special plan to transfer their vote banks to each other for these seats
 iske tahat akhilesh yadav basapa ummidavaar ko to mayawati sapa pratyaashee ko jitaane kaa bidaa uthaaya he
 Akhilesh Yadav, under the changed new strategy, is now focusing on those seats where the BSP candidate is in the fray
 sapa adhyaksh ne chathe charan kii sultanpur, pratapgarh or shravasti jaisi seat par akele jaakar basapa ke paksh main chunaav prachaar kiya he
 At the same time, BSP supremo Mayawati has campaigned in favor of SP candidate in all seats like Faizabad, Barabanki, Gonda and Bahraich
 darasal loksabhaa chunaav ke sapa-basapa gathbandhan banane ke samay se hi vot transfar ko lekar raajnneetik pandit ashanka jataa rahe the
 Looking at the voting trends of the initial phase, the sp-bsp's vote was easily transferred to each other
 lekin chauthe or paanchaven charan kii voting main kai aisi loksabhaa siten hai, jahaan par sapa or basapa ke vot transfar main donon partiyon kii kaaphi dikkatein dekhne ko mili hai
 The Banda Lok Sabha seat of Bundelkhand has gone to the sp's account under the alliance, from where Shyama Charan Gupta was in the fray
 vahiin, 2014 main basapa ke pratyaashee rahe aarake patel ne is baar bijepi ummidavaar ke taur par taal thonk rahe the
 Similarly, Bal Kumar Patel, who was the SP candidate in 2014, was in the fray from the Congress
 is tarah se aarake patel ne basapa ke voter ko apane paale main saadhane kaa kaam kiya to bal kumaar patel ne sapa ke votbank ko apane saath jodne kii kavayad kii he
 Like the Banda parliamentary seat, the Akbarpur Lok Sabha seat has gone to the bsp's account under the alliance
 yahaan se basapa se nisha sachaan chunavi maidan hai
 At the same time, leaving the SP at the last moment, Mahendra Singh Yadav had descended from the Progressive Samajwadi Party and got the sp's vote bank in his court
 aise hi fatehpur loksabhaa seat par bhi sapa kaa vot bank basapa ko transfar hota najar nahin aayaa he, kyonki sapa se saansad rahe rakesh sachaan is baar congress se chunavi maidan main the
 Realizing this, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati changed their strategy, and the two leaders rallied together and made a strategy to transfer their votes by holding public meetings in different seats in person
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki sapa-basapa kii yah ranneeti kitni safal rahati he

 According to experts, these goons are creating furore in these states in the name of such different organizations

 In a recent incident, a man named Tahir Hussain was beaten to death by a mob in Kurukshetra, Haryana, because the traffickers of that family were accused, followed by Punjab and The Haryana High Court handed over the investigation to the CBI, which was later approved by the Supreme Court
 lekin is faisle ke baad bhi in rajyon main gau raksha ke naam par jari gundgardee par koi khaas lagaam nahin lagi he
 According to a rough estimate, smugglers get up to 3 thousand rupees in Punjab on the smuggling of a cattle, which is why despite all the laws and fear of goons, smuggling is also bad

 But in Jharkhand, the suppression of the original settlers is not taking the name of rest, but there is no name for their exploitation
 varisht patrkaar anuj kumaar sinha kii kitaab shoshan ke usee itihaas kaa dastavej he
 The story of European torture dates back to six years (1933–1939), while the mass murder, suppression and exploitation of native settlers in Jharkhand has been going on since 1834, when coal mining began in Raniganj

 The faces that suddenly started appearing after the state was formed, were restless

 wikileaks tweeted on Monday morning, possibly leading to a new political storm in India before the election
 vikiliks ne twitor par likhaa kiuske cabals menkisi america diplomet ne modi ko kabhi 'bhrasht na hone vaala' or 'iklauta eemaandaar bhartiya rajaneta' nahin kaha
 Not only this, wikileaks also clarified that its founder Julian Assange never said anything about Modi and Modi supporters and BJP have falsely campaigned about it

 The Consul General found that many areas had progressed
 par unhone sampradayik rishton or 2002 kii hinsa ke liye javabdeh adhikariyon ke khilaaf karrwai ke bare main poocha
 Modi appeared visibly angry

 At the time of the cable release in 2011, Narendra Modi was the frontrunner in the race for the post of PM in BJP
 cabel main khud ko 'bhrasht na kiya ja sakane vaala' kahe jane par modi ne khushi jataai thi
 He had also issued a statement in this regard on his website, which was titled, 'I am happy that America has accepted that Modi is honest
 'modi kii website par kiya gaya 'jhootha' daawa?bijepi ne bhi maukey kaa phayda uthaate hue daawa kiya tha ki vikiliks ke cabel main eemaandaar ghoshit kiye jane vaale modi iklaute netaa hai
 The BJP also said that it seems that the US is rethinking its visa policy on Modi
 2002 ke gujarat dangon main naam aane ke baad 2005 main america ne modi ko vija dene se manaa kar diya tha
 However, when the Supreme Court-appointed SIT gave Modi a clean chit, then US Ambassador Nancy Powell met Modi in Ahmedabad
 vikiliks kii website par padhie, kya likhaa tha us cabel main In the jadeja-anderson controversy, England fast bowler James Anderson was not convicted because there was not enough evidence to ban him
 isisi kii ore se niyukt kiye gaye nyaayik ayukta gordan louis ne yah daawa kiya he
 Gordon had heard of the charges against Anderson
 unhone kaha ki gavaah khud apni team ke paksh main bahut pakshpatpurna the or ekmaatr tatasth gavaah (trent brij kaa dekharekhakarta) ne kaha ki usne zyada kuch nahin dekha tha
 In addition, there was no audio evidence to prove the offending tantrums, nor was there video footage of the incident in the corridor between the grounds and the dressing room
 gordan ne kaha ki saboot kii kami ke kaaran unhen faisle par pahunchane ke liye apni samaj par nirbhar rahanaa padaa
 He told ESPN Cricinfo, 'as i looked at the evidence and saw the final statements of the representatives of the parties concerned, then i acted with my understanding
 main gavaah ke kisi bhi tark se aasaani se santusht nahin ho sakaa
 'india's argument was that Anderson pushed Jadeja without provoking him
 jadeja ne kathith rup se aarope lagaaya ki anderson ne galiyare main unhen abhadra gaali dena jari rakhaa jiske kaaran unhone bhi use dhakka de diya
 Jadeja denied aggression
 anderson ke mutabik, jadeja aakraamak the or bina kisi uksaave ke aakraamak hokar uske saamne aa gaye
 Anderson said he was surprised by Jadeja's behavior
 pandrah saal tak dilli kii gaddi sanbhaalane vaali purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne kaha he ki agar bijepi sarkaar banane kii sthiti main pahunch gai he, to use sarkaar bana leni chahie
 He has also said that no MLA from any party wants elections
 congress ke pravaktaa is bayaan se sadame main chale gaye or aam aadmi party ne aarope lagaaya ki bijepi or shila mili hue hai
 The question is why the ruckus on it? At least if the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party do not question this statement, it is better
 pichley saal disambar main nattejey aane ke baad jab yah saaf hua ki kisi dal ko bahumat nahin milegaa, tab bijepi ne sabase bade dal ke rup main ubharne ke baavjood sarkaar nahin banane kaa faisla kiya
 After this, the Aam Aadmi Party formed the government with the support of the Congress, saying that it has been decided only by asking the people of Delhi
 is kathith janamat surveykshan ke boote aam aadmi party ne us congress ke saath haath milaayaa, jiske bare main aap pramukh arvind kejariwal ne chunaav se pehle apane bacchon kii kasam khaakar kaha tha ki vah kabhi congress ke saath nahin jaaenge
 In just 49 days, he resigned from the government, because he had a misunderstanding that the whole country is like Delhi and like Delhi, the people of the country will also take him to the Lok Sabha elections
 loksabhaa chunaav main dilli kii sabhi saaton siton par bijepi ne bade antar se jeet hasil kii
 If they are seen in the assembly seats, then BJP has won 60 of the 70 assembly seats in Delhi
 nishchit taur par yah janadesh aam aadmi party ke us kathith janamat surveykshan se adhik pramanik he, jiske aadhaar par usne congress se haath milakar dilli main sarkaar banaai thi
 If the BJP presents it as the wish of the people of Delhi, then it should not be objected
 yah sahi he ki bijepi chaahe sabase bade dal ke rup main ubhari ho, lekin vah bahumat se dur he
 It will be able to prove its majority in the Assembly only if some MLA of Congress or Aam Aadmi Party support it or give the BJP a chance to run a minority government by remaining un-present
 iske peeche jod-tod yaa kharid-farokht ke aarope bhi lage hai, jinhen bebuniyaad nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The question is that if assembly elections are held in Delhi, then what is the guarantee that any single party will get majority and the results which came in December, will not come again
 ferj karen agar dobaaraa trishanku vidhansabha banati he, to kya ek baar phir raashtrapati shashan kii naubat nahin aegi
 The other side is the mlas
 shila dikshit sahi kahati hai ki kisi bhi party kaa koi vidhayak chunaav nahin chahta he
 The Aam Aadmi Party should also ask its mlas honestly what they want
 kisi vidhayak ke paas janata ke bich jaakar dobaaraa vot maangane kaa koi naitik aadhaar nahin he, kyonki uske paas dikhaane ke liye koi kaam nahin he
 In the Congress too, people are demanding the election, who have lost the assembly elections and who feel that they may reach the assembly due to re-election
 sabase badi party agar sarkaar banaati he, to aisa koi pehali baar nahin hoga
 In 1991, the Congress emerged as the largest party in the Lok Sabha, running a minority government and later winning a majority
 sabase badi party ke rup main ubharne ke naate hi 1996 main shankar dayaal sharma ne atal bihari vaajapeyi ko sarkaar banane kaa mauka diya tha
 If the Deputy Governor wants to give BJP as the largest party to form a government, then there is nothing unconstitutional in this
 shila dikshit bhi yahi kah rahi hai
 The same Sheila Dixit, whom it is being said that the people of Delhi have started to miss her

 salmaan khan kii film bharat kaa trailor release ho gaya he
 Race 3 received very poor ratings from the critics and at the box office the film achieved average success
 pichhlaa saal hi aisa tha ki teenon superstar khan box offis par apana jalawaa nahin dikhaa paae
 However, after the shock of Race 3, Salman is once again in search of a blockbuster film and 'bharat' could prove to be Salman's film which will once again give him the title of Bollywood's biggest star
 is multistarar film main salmaan ke alaava disha paatani, jaiki shroff, katrina caff or sunil grover jaise sitare hai jinka khud kaa jabardast fain base he
 The director is Ali Abbas Zafar, with whom Salman has given super hit films like 'sultan' and 'tiger Zinda Hai', but still there is a factor that can make a difference in India's earnings
 3 minute 11 second kaa bharat kaa trailor haal hi main release hua tha or jaisaa ki aksar hota he, salmaan kii film kaa ye trailor release hote hi pehle number par trend hone laga
 The special thing about Salman's films is that the trailer of his films often gets a lot of love from the fans and at times, the trailer is estimated by how much business his film is going to do
 haalanki, is baar salmaan phens kaa ek dhada aisa bhi he jinhen ye trailor pasand nahin aayaa he
 These fans complain that after watching the trailer, the story of the film is not known and the trailer of India is less entertaining than their previous films
 ek daur aisa tha jab salmaan khan screen par nazar aate the or darshakon main khushiyon kii lahar daud padati thi
 There are many films such as Ready, Bodyguard, Kick, Dabangg in which Salman only outweighed the weakest from his screen presence
 haalanki, pichley kuch saalon main soshal media jaise powerful madhyam ke chalate log masala filmon ke test ko lekar chaukanne hue he or sirf star factor se filmein chalane ke din lad chuke hai
 a large section in India now only cares about good content, due to which many stars have to move out of their comfort zone and focus on good storylines
 salmaan kii bharat bhi usee tarah kii film kahi ja sakati he
 The film is a remake of the Korean film Odd to My Father
 is film main ek shaks kii yatra ko dikhaaya gaya he jiske balldrop main bharat-paak kaa vibhaajan bhi he
 Odd to My Father is considered to be one of South Korea's finest films and it is believed that the plot in this film of Salman can be complicated compared to his previous films
 aise main salmaan kaa wo darshak varg jo unhen sirf screen par dekhne aata he or jinhen script vagairah se khaas matlab nahin he, aise kuch phens is film se thodaa chhitak sakate hai jo salmaan ke liye kisi vidambnaa se kam nahin hoga
 But if India performs well due to its screenplay and its script, then it can prove to be a golden time for Bollywood because if a star considers it more important to work on the script of the film than its star power then the country It will be no less than a gift for cinematographers
 bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) ne nai grad e+ shrenee kii shuruyaat kii he, jisamen captain viraat kohli sahit 5 khilaadiyon ko jagah di gai he
 The board will pay Rs 7 crore annually to cricketers who are in Grade a +
 lagaataar acha pradarshan karne vaale khilaadiyon ko grad e+ shrenee se puraskrit karne kaa suzav khud purv captain mahendra singh dhoni or maujuuda captain viraat kohli ne diya tha
 In 2017, Shikhar Dhawan's salary increased to 33 matches, 1637 runs and 1300%, in fact, Team India's previous head coach Anil Kumble took the initiative on pay structure
 sabase pehle unhone varisht khilaadiyon se baat kii or phir ise supreme court dwaara gathit cricket prashaskeey samiti(sioe) samaksh rakhaa tha
 Kumble also made a presentation on the new salary structure in front of top officials of COA and BCCI a month before leaving the post of coach in May last year
 us kumble model main 5 karod ke top contract kii baat rakhi gai thi
 After this, the CAO had a round of meetings with Kohli, Dhoni, Rohit Sharma and Team India head coach Ravi Shastri on the issue of increment of players
 aakhirkaar disambar main khilaadiyon ne e+ shrenee anubandh kii sifarish kar di
 rohit-kohli's salary more than Dhoni, Shami out of BCCI Central Contract COA President Vinod Rai has said in an interview that the suggestion came from Dhoni and Virat
 ye donon e+ category ko shandaar pradarshan karne waalon ke liye rakhana chaahate the
 He argued that only those players, who are playing in all three formats, are in the top-10 rankings in this category
 yani, jin 5 ko sheersh shrenee main rakhaa gaya he ve abhi teenon praaroop main khel rahe hai
 They are entitled to higher wages
 or is aadhaar par dhoni e+ ketegory se baahar ho gaye
 She received her second grade- Grade A
 is shrenee main aise khilaadi shaamil hai, jinka ek praaroop main khelnaa tay he
 Dhoni has retired from the Test
 aswin or jadeja simit overon main chayan ke daavedaaron main nahin rah gaye hai
 Saha and Pujara are only playing in Test matches
 isliye in sabhi ko duusari shrenee main rakhaa gaya he
 Obviously, the grade has been decided on the lines of 'play more matches and get more salary'

 State President Keshav Prasad Maurya is claiming that the name of CM will be finalized by the evening of Saturday, March 18, but Maurya's statement also indicates that his candidature itself has weakened
 maury ne kaha ki upi ke nae siem ke maamle main party haikaman ne unase report maangi thi or unhone ye report saunp di he
 On Wednesday too, Maurya had given a statement that he has been asked his choice for the post of CM and he will give the name of party president Amit Shah on his behalf
 maury ke isi bayaan se sanket mil rahe hai ki kya ve upi ke sambhavit mukhyamantriyon kii list se baahar ho gaye hai
 Because to ask Maurya for his favorite name means to end his claim by himself
 gauratlab he ki upi chunaav ke nattejey ghoshit hone ke baad maury siem pad ke liye bade daavedaar bataae ja rahe hai
 Under his leadership, the party won a historic victory in UP
 ve amit shah or narendra modi kepsandida netaahain or unki gaiyr-yadav obisi tabake ke voton ko bijepi kii ore modane main ahm bhoomika maani gai he
 However, he is a first-time MP and lacks administrative experience
