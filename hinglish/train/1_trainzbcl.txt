supreme court ne jaaton ko obisi kota ke tahat aarakshan dene ke centre ke faisle ko mangalvaar ko radd kar diya he
 The court said in its judgment that the decision of the Center is based on decades old data and the basis of backwardness for reservation should be social and not economic or educational
 court ne kaha ki sarkaar ko trans gender jaise nae pichde group ko obisi ke tahat laana chahie
 Former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda has said something similar
 hooda ne kaha ki sarkaar ko supreme court ke samaksh punarvichaar yachika daayar kerani chahie, kyonki endie ne bhi iskaa samarthan kiya tha
 Significantly, Hooda and Chaudhary Virender Singh were once together in the Congress, but Virender Singh joined the BJP by breaking ties with the Congress just before the Lok Sabha elections last year
 supreme court ne apane faisle main kaha ki centre kaa faisla dashakon puraane aankadon par aadhaarit he or aarakshan ke liye pichhadepan kaa aadhaar saamaajik hona chahie, na ki aarthik yaa shaikshanik
 The court said that the government should bring new backward groups like Trans Gender under OBC
 court ne kaha ki haalanki jati ek pramukh kaarak he, lekin pichhadepan ke nirdhaaran ke liye yah ekmaatr kaarak nahin ho sakati he or jat jaisi raajnneetik rup se sangathit jatiyon ko obisi suchi main shaamil karnaa anya pichde virgon ke liye sahi nahin he
 The Supreme Court found flaws in the Center's decision not to heed the OBC panel's conclusion that Jats were not backward castes
 gauratlab he ki supreme court ne apane aadesh ke tahat transgender ko teesri shrenee main shaamil kar unhen obisi kota main aarakshan diya tha
 This decision came on this petition of the OBC Defense Committee
 yachikakarta ram singh kii ore se supreme court main pesh vakil ombir singh ne kaha ki ye ek aihtihaasik faisla he or wo is faisle kaa swaagat karte hai
 While Jat reservation committee chairman Colonel OP Sindhu expressed disappointment over the decision
 unhone kaha ki is maamle main wo kai saalon se ladaai ladate aae hai or ye ladaai aage bhi jari rahegi
 He also said that he will file a review petition on this decision and will also launch a movement if needed
 pichley saal march main tab kii manmohan singh sarkaar ne nau rajyon ke jaaton ko anya pichhadaa varg yani obisi list main shaamil kiya tha
 On the basis of this, Jats also became entitled to 27 per cent reservation for obcs in jobs and higher education
 iske khilaaf supreme court main kai yachikaayen daayar kii gai thim
 The current Narendra Modi government has also supported the decision to provide OBC reservation to Jats
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle 4 march 2014 ko kiye gaye is faisle main dilli, uttarakhand, uttar pradesh, gujarat, himachal, bihar, madhya pradesh, or haryana ke alaava rajasthan (bharatpur or dhaulpur) ke jaaton ko kendriya suchi main shaamil kiya tha
 Several organizations, including the OBC Defense Committee, had said that the OBC Commission has stated that Jats are not socially and educationally backward, while the government has been citing CSIR report

 Experts point out that this move by RBI could see a significant increase in banks' declared npas in the coming quarter
 vittiya kshetra kii reating agency isiaare ke group head karthik shrinivasana kehete hai, ''rigerv bank ke is kadam se choti avadhi main lendaaron or dendaaron donon kii sirdardi badhane vaali he
 Nevertheless, its far-reaching consequences will be pleasant as it will reduce the tendency of banks to distribute evergreen loans, thereby maintaining good health of the banking sector
 '' sadabahaar karj baantne se unka matlab aise karjon se he jo bank, karj main duube kisi karjadaar ko apana koi purana karj chukaane ke liye de dete hai
 As per the new norms, all lenders will have to put forward the policy related to the disposal of bad debt related matters, including the time limit for its disposal, after its board approves it

 There are about 50 such large borrowers with banks worth Rs 2,000 crore

 # lessonlearned— Edward Snowden (@snowden)october 1, 2015 According to the Meteorological Department, in 2017, the southwest monsoon is going to be normal for the second consecutive year
 monsoon kaa yah aankada desh main kharif fasal ke liye behad ahm he iske baavjood desh main kisaanon ko isse koi raahat nahin pahunchane ja rahi he
 This is because despite the normal monsoon, farmers are not guaranteed high yields because the areas where the monsoon would affect the kharif yields have recorded much lower than normal rainfall
 saamaanya monsoon par bhi bigadaa kharif utpaadan kaa anumaanvhin, kendriya krishi vibhaag ne 2017 main kharif fasal utpaadan main beete varsh kii tulana main 2
 It is expected to report a decrease of 8 percent
 krishi vibhaag ke mutabik 2017-18 main kharif utpaadan 135 million ton rahane kaa anumaan he jabaki 2016-17 main kharif utpaadan 139 million ton rahaa
 Kharif Paddy (rice) Production 94 during 2017-18 as per Agriculture Department estimates
 48 million ton rahegaa
 While Paddy production last year 96
 39 million ton rahaa
 However, in the last five years average, paddy production in 2017 was 2
 59 million ton adhik rahane kaa anumaan he
 Read also: Apology does not merge farmers' debt, banks are not unnecessarily worried
 Production of coarse grains in 2017-18 31
 49 million ton rahane kaa anumaan he
 While the production of coarse grains 32 in 2016-17
 71 million ton tha
 Similarly this year production of other kharif crop maize 0
 52 million ton ghatakar 18
 It is estimated to be 73 million tonnes
 krishi mantralay ke mutabik 2017 ke kharif sijan main dalhan utpaadan 8
 It is estimated to be 71 million tonnes while it was 9 in 2016
 42 million ton tha
 22 last year
 40 million ton ke tilhan utpaadan kii apeksha 2017 main yah 20
 It is estimated to be 68 million tonnes
 inke alaava is saal kharif fasalon main kapaas or jute kii paidaavaar bhi 2016 kii tulana main kam rahane kaa anumaan he
 However, only the sugarcane production in kharif crops is expected to be relieved this year
 krishi vibhaag ke anumaan ke mutabik 2017 main kul 338 ton ganna utpaadan rah saktaa jabaki 2016 main yah mahaj 307 million ton tha
 Why the impaired kharif production estimates? On the data of the weather department, the agriculture department says that the important south-west monsoon for the kharif crop will not be able to give good yields even though it is normal this time
 iske liye monsoon ke dauraan un ilaakon main acchhee barish nahin hona jimmedaar he jahaan kharif fasalon kii buaai kaa bada rakabaa he
 It is worth noting that the Department of Agriculture releases its estimate of the production of crops in 5 stages and this estimate released today is the first estimate of this series
 krishi jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki agle anumaanon main krishi mantralay apane aankadon main neeche kii taraf sanshodhan kar sakati he jisase kharif paidaavaar kii ummid or kam hone kii sambhaavna he
 This improvement in data is expected to reduce after the estimation of unbalanced monsoon rains and flood-ravaged crops across the country
 ise bhi padhein: sabakaa nahin, sirf jaruratmand kisaanon kaa karj hona chahie maaf: nabardgorawalaba he ki kerala se 1 june ko shuru hone vaala dakshin-pashchim monsoon kaa chaar maheene lanbaa safar apane antim charan main he
 According to the data, most parts of the country received good rains in June, due to which the farmers were uplifted and sowing was done throughout the country in the Kharif season
 iske baad july ke dauraan bhi monsoon saamaanya rahaa or kharif buaai ke rakabe main or vruddhi darj kii gai
 But with the monsoon coming down during August and September, only a few areas received more than normal rains and the farmers were disappointed
 is monsoon main assam, bihar, purvi uttar pradesh ke tarai kshetron, odisha, dakshini chhattisgarh, gujarat or rajasthan ke kuch hisson main baadh ke chalate kharif fasalon ko vyapak rup main nuksaan pahunchaa he
 The southern parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh, western Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra's Vidarbha and Marathwada regions, Punjab and Haryana have received less than normal rainfall, which has adversely affected the kharif crop
 bhartiya haaki team ko agle maheene china main hone vaale asian khelon main padak kii prabal daavedaar bataane vaale purv captain dilip tirki ne mukhya coach jose brasa ke sur main sur milaate hue kaha he ki antarrashtriya str par lagaataar achche nattejey dene ke liye team ko ek khel manovaigyanik kii sakht jarurat he
 Tirkey said, "the team is in dire need of not only a sports psychologist but also a dietician
 lagaataar achche pradarshan ke liye maansik dridhta par jor dena jaruri he jo khel manovaigyanik hi kar saktaa he
 After the victory, he will also be the victim of over-confidence and focus on recovery
 ’ rashtramandal khelon main upavijeta rahi bhartiya team ke spanish coach brasa ne is jarurat par jor diya tha
 Captain Rajpal Singh, however, believed that the team did not need any such expert
 rashtramandal khelon main bharat ke pradarshan kii saraahna karte hue tirki ne kaha ki isse agle maheene china main hone vaale asiad main padak kii sambhaavna jaagi he
 The veteran defender, called India's Wall, said, "the way the team is playing aggressive hockey, i think we will win a medal in the Asiad
" iske liye haalanki dephence or penlti carnor par or mehnat karne kii jarurat he
 The Indian team could not make it to the semi-finals in Doha Asian Games 2006 after finishing third in Pool b after Korea and China
 saatven sthaan par rahi bhartiya team ke liye tirki ne toornament main chaar gol kiye the
 Giving tips to defenders, Tirkey said, "we should focus on tackling and marking
 final main austrailia ke khilaaf aath gol ganvaana chintaa kaa vishay he
 If the whole team is fit then why are they losing so many goals
 is par dhyaan dena hoga
 It is necessary to prevent scattering in the defense
 ’asiad ke liye team main anbhavi farward prabhjot singh or dephender igness tirki ko shaamil kiye jane kii maang karte hue unhone kaha ki coach brasa kii ranneeti par ye khare utarate hai or inke anubhav ko khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He said, 'brassa's emphasis is on substitution and Ignace and Prabhjot come true in this strategy
 donon ke paas kaaphi anubhav he jise andekha nahin kiya ja saktaa
 On the Pakistani hockey team's warning to repay the loss to India at the World Cup and Commonwealth Games in the Asiad, Tirkey said that technically the Indian team is far better
 unhone kaha, ‘aisa nahin he ki bharat ne apni dharti par khilne ke kaaran hi pakistan ko haraaya he
 In terms of technique, fitness and performance, the Indian team is better than Pakistan and it will be proved again in the Asiad, although the team will have to play against complacency

 bhaawanaaon, samvednaaon or urja kaa visphot hua 29 march, 2019 ko bhopal ke rabindra bhawan main yojit india today sahitya varshiki rachana utsav ke dauraan
 Considered as Ghazal Ki Abaru, Wasim Barelvi, the country's famous poet, sang the melody of music with veteran satirists and poets
 rachana utsav kaa praarambhik satr andaaj-e-bayaan wasim barelvi kii gajalon or najmon se gulzaar hua
 India Today editor Anshuman Tiwari interacted with him openly on many issues including society, politics
 jawaab main unhone kai baar tarannum main ghazal sunai jo unki jindagi ke khattey-mithe anubhavon kaa saar thi
 Beginning with Wasim Barelvi, he said, "poetry and poetry are the practice of whole life
 mushaairon or kavi sammelnon main bahut se rang aate hai, jate hai
 i have been witness to this for 57-58 years
 lekin aisi mehfil, aisi sabha jisamen ek-ek cheharaa apane andar ek puri daastaan rakhata ho, jiske paas sahitya ho, adhyayan ho, unke saamne main koshish karuunga ki main apni vahi rachanaaen pesh karun jinamein tali se zyada aap kii ankhon main chamak paidaa ho
 "he had some lions on today's political climate: the land remains the same as it is, but the land-sharing keep changing; i have been flowing like a river for centuries, if stopped it would have become a lake; a drop that spread i was in the sea, got stuck in a few jars of clay; How can i become big in this age, this littleness is not enough for me
 kisi jameer vaale ko duusare kii ummiido-apekshaaon par jeene kaa dabaav kis tarah hota he, us bhav ko sametane vaali ghazal ko shaayar ne tarannum main sunayah apane chehre se jo jaahir he chhupaayen kaise, teri marji ke mutabik najar aaen kaise; ghar sajaane kaa tasawwur to bahut baad kaa he, pehle ye tay ho ki is ghar ko bachaaen kaise; lakh talavaarein badi aati hon gardan kii taraf, sar jhukaana nahin aata to jhukaaen kaise
 On Tiwari's gesture to the presence of young people in the program, Wasim Barelvi introduced some of his new lions: When do you forget to lift a finger in the eyes, old people forget their age; If a broken kayak comes down on revolt, then forget to raise the storm head for a few days
 is ghazal kaa aglaa sher aapasi takaraar par kuch yun thah jinhen aapas main takaraane se hi fursat nahin milti, unheen shaakhon ke pattey lahalhana bhul jate hai
 He also pointed to the growing trends in today's environment in which everyone wants to live life like this, where no one means anything to anyone
 itnaa bikharaav sambhala nahin jaataa mujhase, khud ko you tub pe daalaa nahin jaataa mujhase; paanv jakhmon ke hue jate hai aise aadi, ab to kanta bhi nikaala nahin jaataa mujhase; phir jo main lautnaa chaahun to jameen ko tarasuun, khud ko itnaa bhi uchhaala nahin jaataa mujhase; jisase dar ho ki palatwaar bhi kar saktaa he, haath aise pe to daalaa nahin jaataa mujhase; pyaar kii raat ho, chat par ho tera saath to phir, chand ko bich main daalaa nahin jaataa mujhase; baat karata hum jamaane ko badal dene kii, apana hi ghar to sambhala nahin jaataa mujhase
 Wasim Barelvi is also among the favorite poets of Ramkatha singer Morari Bapu
 is pahalu kii ore unka dhyaan khinche jane par unhone is sant ko hindustaniyat kii amaanat bataaya
 He also told his old famous lion: i have lost so much in trying to get you, that even if you meet now, you will be sad to meet you
 wasim barelvi ne jhooth par bhi kai sher sunaae
 In this session which lasted for more than an hour, he kept the audience engaged the whole time and shared a lot of shrieks

 Khare started by telling how mobile has become a part of our life and how we are not able to live even a minute without it

 In this way, people's desires have also changed in this era
 pehle ve kuch or paanaa chaahate the lekin ab unki jindagi kaa makasad kuch or ho chukaa he
 Khare's words on this new era were tight, "nowadays man is online, but humanity is getting offline

 In the sarcasm, he described the anguish of a leader who had family planning after four children
 ab use mahasoos ho rahaa tha ki kam bachche paidaa kiye kyonki chunaav main gathbandhan main zyada siten mil gai hai
 Famous satirist Gyan Chaturvedi recited at the end of the session
 unki rachana main hansi nahin thi balki unamem chhipe sawaalon ne shrotaaon ko jhakzor diya
 He was of the opinion that we like to talk less about communal violence, but are not afraid to do violence
 unhone sampradayik hinsa ko lekar tanj kiya or kai sawaal uthaae
 His question was, "do the riots happen with the permission of God, why have we made the headquarters of the riot God's house? And on whose side is God? On the man's side? Hindu or Muslim? ”his questions made people think
 unhone dangon kaa maarmik chithran kar logon kii bhavuk kar diya
 The third session was poetry time as a recitation
 isamen hindi kavita main sakriy, madhya pradesh kii do yuva kavyitriyon babusha kohli or anna maadhuri tirki maujuud ne apni nai-puraani rachanaaen padhin
 Turkeys originally come from the tribal surroundings of Chhattisgarh but have been in Madhya Pradesh for a long time
 unki kavitaaon main adivasee samaaj kaa jatibodh, shahar main aakar rahane se ubharta dwandv or vednaa sab maujuud the
 That tension could be read a lot by the expressions on the face along with his words and text
 babusha apni kavitaaon main khud kavita ko bhi paribhaashit kar rahi thim
 Without going into the female discourse, she also highlighted the suffering of women with seriousness
 rachana utsav ke duusare hisse kii shuruyaat geet sandhya main kavyitri anamika ambar ne kii
 He also used satirical arrows in his songs

 Everyone is the owner, and if he is kind, he gets up

 After devotion, Megha sang her famous song slowly

 Before giving his performance, Megha thanked India Today on the stage of Rachna Utsav and said, "we have a deep bond with India Today

 It was time for the program to end, but Megha was closing her eyes and singing songs one after the other, as if she had been lost, the situation had come

 ) (navratri 2018) Everyone knows about the nine forms of Maa Durga and these forms of mother are worshiped in Navratri (shardiya Navratri 2018)
 hindu dharm main navadurga pujan ke samay hi maa ke mandiron main bhi bhakton kaa tantaa lagata he or unamem bhi maa ke shaktipeethon kaa mahatv alag hi mana jaataa he
 The holy Shakti Peethas are established at different places across India
 devi puraana main 51 shaktipeethon kaa varnan he to devi bhagwat main 108 or devi gita main 72 shaktipeethon kaa varnan miltaa he, vahiin tantra chudamani main 52shaktipithabataae gaye hai
 According to Devi Purana some of the 51 Shaktipeeths are also established abroad
 bharat main 42, pakistan main 1, bangladesh main 4, srilanka main 1, tibet main 1 tathaa nepal main 2 shaktipeeth hai
 Learn the legend of Shaktipeeth in Navratri (navratri 2018) According to a legend of 51 Shaktipeeths of mother, Durga was born as Sati and she was married to Lord Shiva as the daughter of King Prajapati Daksha
 ek baar muniyon ke ek samooh ne yajna yojit kiya
 All the deities were invoked in the yajna
 jab raja daksh aae to sabhi log khadey ho gaye lekin bhagwaan shiv khadey nahin hue
 Lord Shiva was Daksha's son-in-law
 Navratri 2018: dhan laabh or sheeghra vivaah ke liye navaratri par karen ye upaayyah dekh kar raja daksh behad krodhit hue
 Sati's father Raja Prajapati Daksha also organized a yagna to avenge his humiliation
 us yajna main brahma, vishnu, indra or anya devi-devataaon ko aamantrit kiya, lekin unhone jaan-boojhkar apane jamaata bhagwaan shiv ko is yajna kaa nimantran nahin bheja
 Lord Shiva did not participate in this yagna and when Sati came to know from Narada ji that his father was having a yagna but he was not invited
 yah jaanakar ve krodhit ho uthin
 Narada advises him that there is no need to invite the father to go here
 jab sati apane pita ke ghar jane lageen tab bhagwaan shiv ne unhen samajhaayaa lekin vah nahin maani to prabhu ne swayan jane se inkaar kar diya
 Navratri 2018: Keep these things on the auspicious days of Navratri, even at the stop of Khyalshankar ji, insisted she went to join the Sati Yagya
 yajna-sthal par sati ne apane pita daksh se shankar ji ko aamantrit na karne kaa kaaran poocha or pita se ugr virodh prakat kiya
 At this Daksha started talking abusive things about Lord Shankar in front of Sati
 is apmaan se peedit sati ne yajna-kunda main kudakar apni pranahuti de di
 Navratri 2018: The method of establishing the urn, auspicious time, rules and precautions, when Lord Shankar came to know of this, his third eye opened with anger
 bramhand main pralay va haahaakaar much gaya
 On Shiva's orders, Virbhadra cut off Daksha's head and also punished the other gods for hearing Shiva's condemnation

 aakhir unke dilli aane ke peeche kya makasad he
 Has Hardik come to Delhi only for reservation? After the Ahmedabad rally, he said that the movement will be taken to the district and block levels

 Then why Delhi suddenly, 5 reasons - 1

 Gurjars and Jats are now professionals in the reservation movement

 a post shared by Abhishek Bachchan (@bachchan) onfeb 4, 2016 at 7:56pm PST Assam's famous singer Zubeen Garg had said during the campaigning for the Lok Sabha elections 2019 that his dance was copied by Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma
 garg kaa ishaara sarama ke us charchit chunaav abhiyaan par tha jisamen ve jansabhaon or road sho main bhaajapa ke prachaar geet kii taal par naachte dikhe the
 Everywhere a large number of people, especially women, danced with him
 assam kaa pramukh tyohaar rongali bihu, chunaav ke bich main padaa, jisane jashn kaa maahaul banane main bhaajapa kii madad kii
 But two months ago, this scenario could not have been imagined when the Northeast Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2016 was boiling in protest and which BJP wanted to bring legislation in Parliament
 use kshetra ke mul nivaasiyon ne ek sambhavit khatre ke rup main dekha
 He feared that this would give legitimacy to illegal Hindu migrants coming from Bangladesh and pose a threat to the resources of the original inhabitants
 is virodh kaa centre assam tha
 Sensing the atmosphere, the BJP did not introduce the bill in the Rajya Sabha, which repealed it and angry coalition partners rejoined the BJP
 assam main, bhaajapa ne apane sahyogiyon assam gana parishad or bodoland pipuls front ke saath, hindu or adivasee voton kaa dhruvikaran sunishchit kiya jabaki teen muslim bahul siton par muslim vot, ol india united democratic front or congress ke bich bant gaye
 The Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme created BJP inroads among tea garden workers and benefited the BJP in three Lok Sabha seats with tea gardens, Dibrugarh, Jorhat and Tezpur

 In states where there are strong leaders, the BJP has not been able to make a dent so far

 *** On Wednesday, a major incident took place in the Parliament House itself, with the opposition attacking the Modi government
 buudhvaar ko sansad bhawan sthit congress party ke karyaalay main congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi or sipiem ke mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ke bich mulaakaat hui
 It is being told that Rahul Gandhi invited Yechury for a meeting
 donon netaaon ke bich kareeb 30 minute kii mulaakaat hui
 The GST bill was discussed between the two in the meeting
 charchaa main rahul ne seetaram yechuri se poocha ki upie or endie sarkaar ke jiesti bill main fark he
 Our amendment is not accepted by the government
 sarkaar ne isko mani bill ghoshit kar diya he
 In such a situation, even if the Rajya Sabha passes the amendment, the bill of the government's will passed from the Lok Sabha will be considered as a pass
 is par yechuri nerahulko jawaab diya ki bhale hi mani bill ke naam par sarkaar manmarjee kar le lekin hamako rajyasabha main sanshodhan paas karakar janata ke bich apni raay spasht kerani chahie
 Even if the government later sends it to the Lok Sabha and that amendment becomes meaningless in the name of money bill
 mulaakaat ke dauraan naashte memrahul or seetaram yechurine coffee or sandwich liya, to bengal main pichley saalon main congress kaise kabhi mamata or kabhi sipiem ke bich kaise sandwich bani rahi he, isaki bhi charchaa hui
 According to sources, Sitaram Yechury's term of Rajya Sabha is ending soon, the thorn of arithmetic is such that, Yechury may need Congress
 aise main congress kii bhavishya main bengal main kya bhoomika rahegi is par bhi charchaa hui
 In conversation with Aaj Tak on meeting, Sitaram Yechury said, "yes, Rahul had invited to meet, so i went to meet him
 hamane sansad se jude muddon par charchaa kii
 "by the way, this meeting is being seen under Rahul's strategy, under which he wants to mobilize opposition parties

 hazaare paksh ne july main kendriya mantri kapil sibbal ke dilli sthit chandani chowk sansadeey nirvachan kshetra main bhi janalokapal ke mudde par isi tarah kaa surveykshan karaayaa tha
 It was then claimed that 95 per cent of the people of the region are in favor of the Jan Lokpal Draft Bill of Hazare
 hazaare ke saathi kaaryakarta manish sitaudiya ne bataaya, ‘sansad kaa sheetakaaleen satr shuru hone se pehle kaa vakt hamaare liye mahatvapurn he kyonki lokapal vidheyak par gaur kar rahi sthaayee samiti bhi is avadhi ke dauraan vibhinn pakshon ke vichaar sunegi or apni report ko antim rup degi
 He said that in these surveys, direct question will be asked to the public whether the public representative of his area should support Hazare's Jan Lokpal
 hazaare paksh kaa janalokapal ke mudde par yah surveykshan uttar pradesh ke shaharon ke alaava dilli ensiaar ke gajiabad or uttarakhand ke dehradun or haridwar main bhi ho saktaa he
 These surveys in Uttar Pradesh will be led by Sanjay Singh, a member of the National Coordination Committee of Hazare's movement 'india Against Corruption'
 hazaare paksh ke sadsy in surveykshanon main sidhe taur par shaamil nahin rahenge
 This survey will be conducted by people associated with Hazare's recent movement on the issue of Lokpal
 lokapal vidheyak par gaur kar rahi sansad kii sthaayee samiti ke sadasyon ke nirvachan kshetron main bhi yah kavayad shuruaati surveykshanon kii safalataa ke aadhaar par kii jaayegi
 Whether this survey will be like an exercise in Sibal's constituency, Sisodia said that it will be relatively small in terms of questions asked by the public
 unhone kaha ki isamen do sidhe sawaal janata se kiye jaayenge
 First, should the people's representatives of your region support Hazare's Jan Lokpal and second, if the people's representatives do not support him, will you vote for him in the upcoming election
 is bich, lokapal ke mudde par pichley maheene ramlila maidan par hue hazaare ke anshan ke dauraan hasil hui daanrashi or kharch kaa audit karaane kaa kaam bhi chal rahaa he

 es rajamauli 'bahubali' ko kitaab ke rup main laane ke baad ab ise chote parde par bhi laane kii yojana bana rahe hai
 Rajamouli said at the launch of 'the Rise of Sivagami', a book based on the blockbuster film 'bahubali', 'my plan now is to make a television series
 haalanki yah daily sope nahin hoga
 i plan to make a seasonal show of 10 to 13 episodes
 '7 april ko phir relies hogi bahubali, dekhne waalon ko milegaa bahubli-2 kaa tikat'da rij of shivgami' ke lekhak anand neelkantan hai, jo ramayana or mahabharat jaise bhartiya mahakavy ke aadhaar par katha pustaken likhane ke liye jane jate hai
 On the question of making 'baahubali' in the circle of security, if not to open Katappa's film on Rajkisi book, the director said, 'his character of Ravana is very different
 yah bahut hi preranadai he, lekin mujhe nahin pataa ki main us par film banaaungaa yaa nahin
 Apart from books he had told me a story which is still limited to paper
 bahut pechida or rochak kahani he
 i was very impressed by it
 isliye shaayad main ise bananaa chahta hum, par dekhte hai kya hota he?'unase jab isaki kahani ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'main abhi iskaa khulaasa nahin kar saktaa
 ' paidaa hone ke saath hi ham kai rishton se jud jate hai lekin dosti ek aisa rishta jise ham khud chunate hai
 If you get good friends, many difficulties in life become easy
 ek adhyayan kii maane to jin logon ke paas achche dost hote hai, ve lambii jindagi jite hai
 Such people handle situations better and remain positive
 ek ore jahaan achche dost jindagi ko aasaan bana dete hai vahiin agar dost achche nahin hai to jindagi kii mushkilen bad jaati hai
 In such a situation, it is very important that you know how to identify friends
 agar aap kisi se dosti karne ja rahe hai to sabase pehle use parakh len or agar wo kuch aisa he to usase turant duuri bana len kyonki wo ek acha dost sabit ho, isaki sambhaavna kam hi he
 Be sure to think about such people before making friends
 
 
 1
 Those who only run their own
 
 
 dost aise hone chahie jo aapkaa saath den
 Not the ones who behave like a boss
 aise logon ko dost banane menapaka hi nuksaan he jo sirf apni hi chalaane main bharosa karte hon
 2
 jo baat-baat par apmaan kare
 
 
 Laughter and jokes are there among friends, but if a person insults you on talk, then he cannot be your friend
 doston kaa kaam ek-duusare ko saport karnaa hota he na kii ek-duusare ko nicha dikhaanaa
 3
 har samay biji rahane vaala
 
 
 We all have our important tasks but a true friend definitely comes to support in times of need
 par agar wo shaks aapaki jarurat ke samay bhi apane biji hone kii baat kahkar nahin aata he to wo acha dost kaise ho saktaa he
 The friend who did not work at the time of need, how was that good friend 
 4
 matlabi logon ko kabhi na banaaen dostkuch dost aise hote hai jo sirf matlab padane par yaa kaam padane par hi yaad karte hai
 Before making such people friends, think about what you will get by befriending him
 5
 Stay away from jealous people
 People who are jealous of your success have no use to make friends
 aise log hi kai baar nuksaan bhi pahunchaa dete hai

 istipha, phir siem pad kii shapath or shuukravaar ko nitish kumaar ne vidhansabha main vishwaas mat bhi hasil kar liya
 With this it was decided that now he will run the government of Bihar with JDU-BJP
 lalu yadav kii party kaa saath chhodane ke baad phir se endie main lautne vaale nitish ko aage chalakar ho saktaa he ki raajnneetik uthapatak kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 But talking about development, they have a great opportunity
 kai aise kaaran hai ki kabhi sushasan babu ke naam se mashhoor rahe nitish kumaar, is aarthik taur par pichde rajya ko bahut aage le ja sakate hai
 These 5 reasons, which can change the picture of Bihar 1
 package pahunchane kii ummid- modi ke vikaas dream ko kaise milegi madad?2014 main centre main sarkaar banane ke baad narendra modi or bijepi ne 2015 main bihar jeetne ke bharsak koshish kii
 But this did not happen with nitish-lalu
 par bihar main sarkaar banane kaa antim lakshya 2017 main hi sahi, hasil ho gaya
 In such a situation, the time has come to fulfill Modi's promise to development from Bihar
 nitish kumaar kaa bijepi ke saath bihar main pehla kaarykaal shandaar rahaa tha
 He did a good job on road and electricity
 aise main agar ab modi sarkaar bihar kaa saath detii he to rajya kii tasviir badal sakati he
 Modi had promised 125,000 crores during the election campaign
 bataa den ki pichley dinon ek artiai main khulaasa hua tha ki sarkaar ne abhi tak is elaan se koi bhi fund nahin jari kiya he
 2
 luk easth pichde par zyada dhyaan, bijepi kii sabase badi policy!bijepi upi ke baad luk east polis ke tahat bade rajyon par focus kiye hue he
 BJP wants to keep a strong hold in the eastern states of Bengal, Bihar in the coming days at any cost
 isamen madad kar saktaa he, bihar main nitish kumaar kaa shashan
 Modi has mentioned many times in his statements that like the western states of the country, he wants to put the eastern states on the road of development
 aise main agar is ore gambhirtha se kuch kaam hota he to nitish kumaar ke netritv main iskaa sabase bada or pehla phayda bihar ko hi hoga
 3
 dilli-bihar main samanta- 19 saal baad bana ye sanyog19 saal baad aisa ho rahaa he ki bihar or dilli main ek hi party yaa gathbandhan kii sarkaar he
 In such a situation, the Modi government in Bihar, along with UP, cannot escape its promise of development
 4
 Image advantage: Both Modi and Nitish give development preference, even though they have given shocking shock politically many times but their style of governance is similar to that of Modi
 unka bhi zyada jor vikaas par hi rahaa he
 The first term has been an example of this
 iske chalate jangal raaj kahe jane vaale bihar main apharan, hatya jaise maamle kam bhi hue the
 Due to political turmoil, Nitish will try to find his own land, so he will not have any other big option other than development
 5
 Strong opposition - Tejaswi's role will also increase with Chacha Nitish Kumar, whether Lalu's second son Tejashwi has come to know how to run power or not, he has a chance to play the role of strong opposition
 ve chahen to argedy ke 87 vidhayakon ke saath bihar main jediu-bijepi kii sarkaar ko pareshaan kar sakate hai
 In such a situation, this government will have to demonstrate under pressure from the opposition
 bihar main ek majboot vipaksh lambey samay se nahin he
 Nitish had said that Lalu is not allowing him to work, so he will not have this excuse now

 With the concept of 'achde Din' when Narendra Modi took over as the 'pradhan Sevak' of the country, it felt like after 10 years, democracy has awakened
 bahumat kii sarkaar bani or har koi yahi mantra japane laga ki 'achche din aa gaye'
 Actually, this is also necessary because with the bugle of elections, the BJP also got votes based on this mantra
 lekin pariksha ab endie sarkaar kii bhi he
 100 days have been completed and India Today Group and Hansa Research tried to know the mood of the country by going public

 aankadon kaa ganit bataata he ki 28 fisad log modi ke kaamkaaj ko ausat maanate hai, jabaki 10 fisad ise bahut acha or 06 fisad bahut kharaab kii shrenee main rakhte hai
 As soon as Narendra Modi took office, rising inflation, increase in rail fares and Pakistan's gossip on the border served to increase the problems of the Center
 jaahir he janata kaa mizaaj in baton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue aayaa he

 com / 30wbhwe2ff — Ajay Devgn (@ajaydevgn) February 6, 2019 2ji maamle main piesi ke apane daayre se baahar jane or is vishay par khinchataan se bachane ke sanyukt sansadeey samiti :jepisi: adhyaksh pisi chaako ke suzav ko ek tarah se khaarij karte hue lok lekha samiti ke adhyaksh murali manohar joshi ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki koi kuch bhi chaahe lekin piesi ko janata ke dhan ke kharch kii jaanch karne kaa sanvaidhanik adhikaar he
 JPC told reporters, the rights of JPC and PAC are clear
 2ji maamle main piesi us samay se jaanch kar rahi he jab jepisi kaa gathan yaa kaig kii report main pesh nahin kii gai thi
 He said that JPC has been asked to present the report in the stipulated time frame by examining the policy related to spectrum from 1998 to 2009 and the lapses by various governments in compliance with it
 jabaki piesi ko janata ke dhan ke kharch se jude vishay or vittiya aniyamitata kii jaanch karne kaa vaidhanik or sanvaidhanik adhikaar he
 Asked about Chacko's request to avoid parallel investigation, he said, "anyone can want anything but we don't believe so
" hamen is maamle main jaanch kaa sanvaidhanik adhikaar he
 Asked whether the matter of calling the Prime Minister on behalf of the PAC went in cold storage, Joshi said, "no subject goes to cold storage nor ends here
" samiti agar aamasahmati se chaahegi tab aisa jarur hoga
 Asked if there is pressure on the PAC not to call certain journalists related to the Radia tapes, Joshi said, "there is no pressure on us
" samiti jab jisko bulaane kii jarurat samajhegi tab aisa kiya jaayegaa
 It is worth noting that unhappy with the public accounts committee (PAC) questioning people from different parties in the 2G spectrum case, Chaco, the president of the newly formed JPC, said a few days ago that the PAC has gone out of its purview and has pulled up the issue
 Should be avoided isse pehle chaako kii tippanee ko tool dene se inkaar karte hue piesi adhyaksh joshi ne kaha tha ki chaako ko apana suzav likhit rup main dena chahie
 On this, Chacko said, perhaps he (joshi) also understands this
 isliye unhone us baat se inkaar nahin kiya jo baat maine kahi thi
 He only said that i should put my point in writing about it
 jabaki, joshi ne kaha tha, chaako varisht or paripakv netaa hai
 If he has any suggestions or has anything to say about PAC, it would be good to write to us

 radha mohan das agrawal (@agrawalrmd) April 20, 2019 Let us know that Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, who is out on bail in the Malegaon bomb blast case, is constantly in the news
 26 / 11 ke aantki hamale main shahid hemanth karkare par kii gai tippanee ko lekar unki chautarafa aalochana ho rahi he
 On his statement, not only the opposition parties but also the leaders of bjp's allied parties are condemning this statement
 pragna thakur ke bayaan se pehle hi bijepi pallaa jhaad chuki he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said on Sadhvi Pragya's statement that no one should make a statement that insults the martyrs
 sadhvi ne galat tippanee kii jiske liye baad main unhone maafee maangi
 a few days ago, Pragya Thakur claimed that he was falsely implicated in the Malegaon blast case by Hemant Karkare, the former head of Mumbai's anti-terrorism Squad and that he was killed due to his deeds
 hemanth karkare mumbai aatanki hamalon ke dauraan shahid hue the
 At the same time, Pragya Thakur also described Hemant Karkare as a national traitor
 sadhvi ne kaha tha ki karkare kii maut 26 / 11 mumbai hamale main isliye hui thi kyonki pratadna se tang aakar sadhvi ne unhen shaap diya tha
 Significantly, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has already expressed resentment over this comment of Pragya Thakur
 unhone kaha tha ki divangat karkare ek bahadur or sahi police adhikari the or unhen shahid kaa darja diya gaya he
 Sadhvi Pragya's comment is her personal opinion and we do not support it

 ye puche jane par ki kya congress aam aadmi party se talmail kar sakati he, unhone is baat ke sanket die ki chunaav baad kuch bhi sambhav he
 After indicating the alliance with Kejriwal's party after the election, however, Sheila Dixit later took a U-turn and said that the Congress will form the government again in Delhi on its own and the party does not need any alliance
 udhar aam aadmi party ne chunaav baad trishanku vidhansabha hone par congress yaa bijepi se kisi bhi talmail kii sambhaavna se inkaar kiya he
 Arvind Kejriwal, the convenor of AAP has tweeted in this regard that Sheila Dixit seems to have given up

 On the other hand, on the statement of Sheila Dixit, Arvind Kejriwal has said in the tweet, 'sheila ji's statement shows that the Congress has conceded defeat
 shila kahati hai ki unke daravaaje sabake liye khule hai
 If this is the case then Congress and BJP should combine
 kisi bhi halaat main ham bijepi yaa congress se koi gathbandhan nahin karenge
 'significantly, in many election surveys, the BJP has predicted a majority

 Explain that the time has also been fixed by the officials in the CAP to pass orders in each case

 kya mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke khaas afasar purv pradhan sachiv rahe rajendra kumaar civil seva se ab VRS yani svaichhik seva nivritti lekar raajnneeti main ja sakate hai? ye sawaal isliye uthaa kyonki 4 janvari ko rajendra kumaar ne dilli ke mukhya sachiv ko chitthee likhakar VRS maangate hue hue aarope lagaaya ki poochtacha ke dauraan lagaataar dabaav banaakar kaha gaya ki agar vah siem kejariwal ko is maamle main fansaa denge to unhen chhod diya jayega
 After this, he came in front of the media on Thursday morning and said that now he will continue to serve the people in other ways, not the government
 aise main enditivi ne poocha ki raajnneeti main bhi logon kii seva karne kaa tarika he to kya aap raajnneeti main aaenge to rajendra kumaar bole
 There are many ways of public service and politics is also one of them, though i have not thought about it yet, but whatever will be the best way to serve people, i will definitely adopt it
 sawaal isse aage badhkar yah bhi uthta he ki agar raajnneeti main aate hai to kya vah aam aadmi party kaa daaman thamenge? kejariwal ke kareebi hone ke chalate yah charchaa joro par he
 It is also important to note that if Rajendra Kumar wants to come to the Aam Aadmi Party, then the doors of the party are open for him
 tippaniyan Kejriwal still considers Rajendra Kumar an honest officer and the fact is that since Rajendra Kumar was arrested for the last 6 months, till date he has not appointed any other officer as his secretary, but Rajendra Kumar's next step from the government VRS can be decided only after getting it, because until his VRS is found he is a suspended officer who is bound by the rules of service
 rajendra kumaar dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke kareebi maane adhikari maane jate hai
 Rajendra Kumar He was the first officer whom Kejriwal appointed as his secretary, forming the government for the first time
 pehali baar disambar 2013 main dilli main congress ke samarthan se sarkaar banane ke baad kejariwal ne rajendra kumaar ko apana pradhan sachiv chunaa tha
 After that, when Kejriwal's government came to power again, Rajendra Kumar became his chief Sachin
 disambar 2015 main sibiai ne unke khilaaf kathith bhrashtachar ke maamle main pehle unke dilli sachivalay ke daphtar par chapa maaraa or phir july 2016 main giraftaar karnaa liya tha
 The charge sheet has been filed on Rajendra Kumar in the court and he is currently suspended and now there is not much option left in front of him
 iske baad guuruuvaar subah media ke saamne aakar unhone kaha ki ab sarkaar nahin balki duusare tareekon se ve logon kii seva karnaa jari rakhenge
 In such a situation, NDTV asked that if there is a way to serve people in politics also, would you come into politics, Rajendra Kumar said
 bahut tareeke hote hai public sarvice ke or usamen se raajnneeti bhi ek he, haalanki abhi maine iske liye sochaa nahin he, lekin jo bhi sabase achche tarika hoga logon kii seva karne kaa use main jarur apanaaungaa
 The question goes beyond this and it also arises that if they come into politics, will they join the Aam Aadmi Party? This discussion is in full swing due to Kejriwal's close proximity
 saath main dhyaan rakhane vaali baat yah bhi he ki bahut zaahir he ki agar rajendra kumaar aam aadmi party main aana chahen to party ke darvaaze unke liye khule hai
 The comments kejariwal aaj bhi rajendra kumaar ko ek eemaandaar afasar maanate hai or alam yah he ki beete 6 maheene se jabase rajendra kumaar giraftaar hue tab se lekar aaj tak kisi duusare afasar ko unhone apana sachiv niyukt nahin kiya he, lekin rajendra kumaar kaa aglaa kadam sarkaar se VRS milane ke baad hi tay ho saktaa he kyonki jab tak unki VRS nahin mil jaati tab tak vah ek nilambit afasar hai, jo sarvice ke niyam se bandhaa he
 Rajendra Kumar is considered a close official of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 rajendra kumaar vah pehle afasar the, jinako kejariwal ne pehali baar sarkaar banaate hue apana sachiv niyukt kiya tha
 For the first time in December 2013, after forming the government in Delhi with the support of Congress, Kejriwal chose Rajendra Kumar as his Principal Secretary
 uske baad kejariwal kii sarkaar jane ke baad jab dobaaraa satta main ai tab bhi rajendra kumaar hi unke pradhan sachin bane
 In December 2015, the CBI raided his Delhi Secretariat office and then arrested him in July 2016 for alleged corruption
 rajendra kumaar par adaalat main aarope patr daakhil ho chukaa he or philhal wo nilambit hai or ab unke saamne zyaada vikalp bhi nahin bache hai
 Kejriwal still considers Rajendra Kumar an honest officer and the fact is that since Rajendra Kumar was arrested for the last 6 months, till date he has not appointed any other officer as his secretary, but Rajendra Kumar's next step from the government VRS can be decided only after getting it, because until his VRS is found he is a suspended officer who is bound by the rules of service

 bazaar main kuch bhi bik saktaa he
 Oh sir! Patalkot was also sold
 mahaz 11 lakh main madhya pradesh kii anuthi duniya 'patalkot' kaa vah hissaa bech diya gaya, jahaan se is khubasurat vaadi kaa vihangam hissaa dikhaai detaa tha
 No one else was the one who had the responsibility of saving
 kudarat ne hazaron saalon se apane vikaas main apni sabhi santanon ko samanta kaa naiysargik haq diya hoga
 Even in the history of the monarchy, dictators have not taxed things like river, mountain, forest, air for the common man, keeping it universal, without any written constitution
 sattar saal pehle ke bharatiyon ne bhi jab samvidhan kii prastaavna atmarpit kii, tab samta, swatantraaa, nyaay kii baat kaa bada dhyaan rakhaa
 But it was only in the third decade after liberalization that the mass orgy of capital made the spectacle, in which only the capture of resources for their own benefit, maximum plunder from possession
 lut kisi bhi keemat par
 Its latest example is that part of Patalkot, which no one else gave to a company in the name of adventure activities by the government
 company ne bahut behayaayi se vahaan apane kabje kii baagad bhi lagaakar 'laabh kamaane kii factory' bhi chaalu kar lee
 It is good for the people of Madhya Pradesh, who changed the government
 bhala ho akhbaar 'patrika' kaa, jisane dam se yah mudda uthaa diya
 And good luck to the Congress government and the Chief Minister, who took cognizance of the matter
 varanaa, bahumat kii takat paane ke baad dharoharon ko girvee rakhane ke kai udhaaharan hamane pehle bhi dekhe hai, chhattisgarh main kuch saal pehle shivnath nadi ko ek company ko bech daalane kii kavayad ham pehle bhi dekh chuke hai
 This could not happen due to heavy opposition, but it is a litmus test to transfer this resources to capital
 yadi aap bolenge nahin, virodh nahin karenge, to bech die jaaenge
 Why look at Patalakot
 
 
 ? patalkot shabd sunakar aapke zahan main ek rahasyamayi sansar kii chhavi aati he
 There are various stories about it
 sunate hai, yahaan suraj kii roshni nahin pahunchati, log ab bhi adimanav kii tarah rahete hai
 It is the area of tamia block of Chhindwara district
 yahaan pramukh rup se bhaaria adivasee rahete hai
 Primitive Tribal Group ie Primitive Tribal Group i
e
 PTG
 janaganana, 2011 ke anusaar yahaan kii kul aabaadi baarah aabaad gaanvon main 3,820 he
 This area is spread over 79 square kilometers
 samudr sataha se isaki oonchai 2,750 se 3,250 foot he
 It is located 62 km north of Chhindwara on the Satpura plateau and 23 km from Tamia block headquarters
 teen taraf se oonchi pahadiyon se ghira yah kshetra avaagaman ke paryaapt sadhano se vanchit he
 To go to any village in Patalakot one has to descend 1,200 to 1,500 feet
 isaki bhugolic paristhiti hi ise vicitra banaati he, lekin iske saath hi un 3,000 logon kaa jivan bhi he, jise ham mukhyadhara se baahar kaa jivan maanate rahe hai
 It is a different matter that his mainstream is the same for those people, because he was happy in that, he used to get his needs there and it is not very old thing
 patrkaar mitra saket dube ne bhaaria janajati par shodh karte hue jaankaree nikaali thi ki 1960-61 main tata institute kii research officer sarala devi raay ne likhaa tha ki '60 ke puure dashak tak or uske baad bhi kaaphi samay tak yahaan kuposhan nahin tha
 Thinker Kapil Tiwari also told from his research study that there was no food insecurity and malnutrition among tribes
 yah maamla pichhali dedh-do sadiyon main angrezi shashan or azaadi ke baad hue tathakthith vikaas ke nattejey main aayaa
 If we look at these two statements equally, then we see a face of development which has destroyed the community which is naturally dependent on such resources, but we consider it only backward
 
 
 
 And when our development starts thinking that tourism will benefit the area, people of that region will get livelihood, then injustice is really happening to them
 patalkot bhi isaki ek nazir banataa nazar aa rahaa he, kya ham us kshetra ke logon ko chidyaghar kaa praani maanakar uske darshan karne ke liye aise vyuu point taiyaar kar rahe hai
 It is a matter of thinking that the Bharatiya Development Authority was opened on June 18, 1978 near this Patalkot
 iskaa mukhyalay bhi tamiya main hi banaaya gaya tha
 What happened to the Bharia community 40 years after the formation of this authority cannot be said
 par yah zarur he ki ab patalkot main ve sansaadhan nahin bache hai, na hi vaisaa rahan-sahan bachaa he, jiske liye patalkot janaa jaataa tha
 The objection is not on tourism
 sabhyataa kii shuruyaat se hi deshaatan hota rahaa he
 There is no entertainment in the country
 vahaan kii shiksha, samskruti, sabhyataa kaa prasar bhi hota he
 Ibn Battuta's journey is not remembered like this
 paryaton ke hi kitne hi aise sthaan aise hi bhageerath prayaason se khoje gaye, jinhone duniya ke liye rahasyamayi sansar ke raste khole
 The world has spread far beyond Bhimbethka, ajanta-ellora, Konark, Khajuraho, but ever since this country has been converted into tourism as pure entertainment, its concern has increased
 keval vahiin nahin, paryaton ke badale main un sansadhano par sabase pehla haq bhi kiskaa hona chahie, yah bhi chintaa kaa ek or vishay he
 And if their sacrifice is also being taken, then what and how it will be given in return should also be decided
 sansadhano par pehla haq uske sthaneey logon kaa hi he, yah samajha janaa chahie ki vah uske upabhokta nahin, sangrakshak hai
 Therefore, no company can ban local people on any river, any pond, any tree, any Patalakot

 According to reports, the bjp's top leadership is thinking about the pros and cons of removing Yeddyurappa to preserve the party's image
 is bich yediurppa ravivaar subah hi dilli ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye
 Sources close to the chief minister said that Yeddyurappa will probably tell the central leadership that he is leading the majority and cannot be unilaterally removed as such
 sutron ne bataaya ki mukhyamantri ke saath ek darjan se bhi zyada mantri or kuch vidhayak bhi dilli aane vaale hai
 He said that the party of ministers and legislators who have come with the chief minister is probably to refute the claim made by dissidents that he is not popular among his associate ministers and mlas

 - input IANS Kanhaiya Kumar's presence has transformed the battle of Begusarai into a national contest
 desh bhar se kai pratishthit log kanhaiya ke samarthan or prachaar ke liye begusarai pahunch rahe hai
 These include not only his old JNU colleagues, but also people associated with different progressive movements and fronts
 kul milakar maahaul kuch aisa he ki jo is daur main kanhaiya ke prachaar ke liye nahin gaya, vah khantee pragatisheel yaa saamaajik kaaryakarta nahin he
 Celebrities like Javed Akhtar, Shabana Azmi and Yogendra Yadav have campaigned in Begusarai to support him
 kanhaiya ko beshak, samarthan milanaa bhi chahie
 He is a fresh face in the current rot of politics
 jo log uske khantee marxvaadi na hone kii shikaayat kar rahe hai, ve bhul rahe hai ki bhartiya loktantr main yah avagun nahin, gun he
 The Indian public does not like a leader who does not have enough flexibility
 beshak, is lacheelepan ke apane khatare hai, lekin yah khatara to sansadeey loktantr kaa aprihaary ang he - agar aapako yah manzur nahin he or aap sidhaa varg sangharsh yaa kranti chaahate hai, to yah rasta aapke liye nahin he
 Understanding each other on this path, combining social pragmatism with your ideology is a compulsion
 to kanhaiya yaa us jaise padhe-likhe noujvaan raajnneeti main aaen, to inkaa swaagat karnaa chahie
 Their presence in the otherwise gloomy and scary atmosphere of Indian politics creates an expectation
 yahi baat jignesh mewaani jaise kuch or yuva chehron ke bare main kahi ja sakati he
 But the atmosphere created in Begusarai these days reminds one of another
 2014 main jab varanasi main narendra modi se muqabla karne ke liye arvind kejariwal utre, tab bhi puure desh se unke samarthan main jane waalon kaa tantaa lag gaya
 The atmosphere was created as if Kejriwal could defeat the Prime Minister
 jab nateeja aayaa, to pataa chalaa ki kejariwal saadhe teen lakh voton se haar chuke hai
 Even if Begusarai is not proved to be Banaras, this fear is not unfounded at all
 bharat main chunaav beshak kisi jashn se kam nahin, lekin unako ladaa kisi jang kii tarah hi jaataa he
 This battle in Begusarai is trivial
 begusarai main kanhaiya kumaar ko sirf giriraaj singh kaa nahin, un tanwir hasan kaa bhi saamana karnaa he, jinhone 2014 kii modi lahar or bholaa singh jaise taqatvar ummidavaar ke baavjood vahaan se saadhe teen lakh se zyaada vot hasil kiye the
 Seeing the performance of Tanveer Hasan, the RJD alliance did not give up this seat for the CPI despite showing generosity to all the parties
 ab khatara yah he ki agar kanhaiya kumaar ne tanwir hasan ke bahut saare vot jhatak liye, to sabko pakistan bhejne vaale giriraaj singh vahaan se jeet hasil kar lenge
 Because in 2014, the BJP received four and a half lakh votes, a large part of it is from those who are aggressive supporters of Modi and BJP politics
 inke bich kanhaiya bahut badi sendhamari nahin kar paaenge
 Kanhaiya is a 'crumbling gang' for many people because of the shameless fascist attitude that BJP is doing with misuse, and the way a large part of the media is supporting it
 kanhaiya yaa is tarah ke logon ke liye istemaal kii jane vaali shabdaawalee hi bataati he ki ek bade samudaay ke bheetar apane sabase sahaj nagarikon or naujavaanon ko lekar kitni ghrinaa bhari ja chuki he
 In the midst of this hatred, Kanhaiya will not win as a CPI candidate
 CPI ke dedh lakh vot hai, jinhen kanhaiya ko jeetne ke liye kam se kam tiguna karnaa hoga
 Then what will be the way for Kanhaiya to win
 
 
 ? vah kuch begusarai vaale hokar jeet sakate hai, kuch dilli ke haathon sataae shaks ke taur par apane logon kii sahanubhuti bator sakate hai
 They can use their Bhumihar identity - or they do or not, Begusarai voters can only do so
 agar kanhaiya ko yah sab nahin karnaa he, to phir begusarai se ladane kii zarurat kya thi
 
 
 The If he was fighting as a national leader, if he wanted to keep himself beyond any caste, local identity, then he could have contested from any seat
 aisi koi seat unhen RJD de bhi detii or unka jeetna aasaan bhi hota
 Begusarai if he has chosen because he belongs there, then he will have to fight elections with all the identities there
 darasal bhartiya loktantr kii asli chunauti yahi he
 Here you cannot win elections by being just a communist, just by being a theorist
 aapako apni bahut sari pahachaanon ke saath jeena or logon ke bich janaa hota he
 The leaders of India do the same thing, but the worry is that they are not ready to accept it
 kyonki ve bharat kii vividhta ke saath sahaj rishta nahin banaate, is vividhta ke bheetar apni pahchaan ke kuch tapuon ko hi apane ekadhikaar kii tarah bachaae rakhana chaahate hai
 Our democracy expects its leaders to be close to the people, to be among them
 jab yah apeksha puri nahin hoti, to matadaata apni jatigat or dharmik pahchaan ke aadhaar par apane numaayinde chunate hai
 But if there is a leader who can assure them that he is beyond everyone's identity, then perhaps he will be more acceptable
 kanhaiya kaa mol yahi he
 He can become the face of this trust
 lekin is bharose ke saath khadey hone kaa matlab tanwir hasan jaise shaleen ummidavaar ke kilaaf prachaar karnaa nahin he, jaisaa javed akhtar karte nazar aae
 It is important to note that in the battle of Begusarai, a confrontation between two people standing almost on one side should not win to Giriraj Singh
 beshak, philhal jo maahaul bana hua he, vah bataa rahaa he ki begusarai apane yuva netritv ke saath hi khadaa hoga, lekin angreji kii yah puraani kahawat ab bhi khari he ki 'dir aar maini slips bitwin da cap and da lips' - hothon or pyaale ke bich bahut sari phisalane hoti hai

 However, this will be decided in the meeting of opposition parties on June 22 under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi
 lekin, ab dekhnaa vaala yah hoga ki ek baar phir 'vatting' hi rah jane ke baad (adwani ko pehle piem in vatting phir president in vatting) ab adwani or unke samarthakon kaa rukh kya hoga

 Forgive me for spoiling the celebrations, but is it not true that a man named Shahabuddin Mohammad made Delhi the capital of India in 1638?

 angrejon ne 1911 main ise rajdhani banaaya
 That is, out of the last 373 years, only 54 years were like this when Delhi was not the capital of India
