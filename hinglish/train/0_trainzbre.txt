 BJP vs RJD in Bihar is directly Mukabalarghuvansh Prasad does not consider JDU even in race
 bhartiya janata party ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ko 'taanashaah' bataate hue rajd saansad raghuvansh singh ne kaha ki bihar main mukhya muqabla rajd or bijepi ke bich he
 Taking a dig at Namo, Raghuvansh said, 'there is chaos in the BJP about Modi
 modi ko kahin surakshit seat nahin mil rahi thi, iske kaaran murali manohar joshi ko kanpur bhej diya gaya
 Surrounding the party on the infighting in the BJP, he said that senior leaders in the BJP are being sidelined
 adwani kii koi nahin sun rahaa he, jaswant singh jaise varisht netaa ko tikat nahin diya gaya
 How can a party which does not have respect for elders, claim to take the country forward '
 ramkripal kaa party chhodana aam baat: raghuvansharamkripal yadav samet kai netaaon ke party chhodane ke bare main puche jane par rajd ke varisht netaa ne kaha ki isamen koi aswabhaavik baat nahin he
 'there is one seat in an election and many people are ticket contenders
 sabhi ko tikat nahin mil saktaa he
 Some people are patient and some people get anxious'
 raghuvansh ne kaha, ‘ye haal keval rajd main hi nahin he, balki har party main he’
 On Tuesday, Gujarat's Narcotics Control Bureau raided two pharma companies in Vadodara and Mumbai and seized drugs worth over Rs 100 crore from them
 yah davaaiyaan videsh bheji jaanee thim or inkaa drugs ke taur par bhi istemaal hota he
 Four people have been arrested in this case
 chaape ke baad vadodara kii dolphin pharma ke diarector anil luhaar, manager jaahid shaikh or mumbai kii kasee pharma ke kishan choudhary or manager murugan ko andipies kanoon ke tahat giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 It is said that these medicines can be found only on the advice of a doctor
 videshon main yah alag tatwon se banati he jo bahut mahange hote hai
 It is very cheap in India, so it is in great demand online
 videshon main anadhikrut rup se bheji jane par yah blake market main milti hai
 These medicines, which are available in India for five rupees, are sold abroad for 8 to 32 dollars
 yahi kaaran he ki yah davaaiyaan duusari vastuon ke naam par gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se courier se bheji jaati hai or phir unka drugs ke taur par istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The comments narcotics control beuro ke gujarat ke jonal diarector hariom gandhi kaa kahana he ki in dawaaiyon kii demand kaaphi zyada he kyonki log inke edict ho chuke hai
 The effect and effect that they have is similar to that of a regular drug and their loss is also like regular drug
 pichley ek saal main hi narcotics control vibhaag ne 700 karod se zyada kii aisi davaaiyaan jabt kii hai jo videshon main online bazaar ke jariye bheji jaani thim
 Apart from these, the ingredients made from these medicines are also sold online
 aise tatv to 2000 karod se zyada kii keemat ke jabt ho chuke hai
 It seems that drug smuggling is now taking place on a large scale through online methods

 It seems that drug smuggling is now taking place on a large scale through online methods
 bataaya jaataa he ki yah davaaiyaan sirf doctor ke paraamarsh par hi mil sakati hai
 In foreign countries it is made up of different elements which are very expensive
 bharat main yah bahut sasti milti he isliye isaki online par bade paimaane par maang he
 It is found in the black market when shipped unauthorized abroad
 bharat main paanch rupee main milane vaali yah davaaiyaan videshon main 8 se 32 dollar tak main bikati hai
 This is the reason why these medicines are illegally sent by courier in the name of other items and then they are used as drugs
 tippaniyan Hariom Gandhi, Gujarat zonal director of Narcotics Control Bureau, says that the demand for these medicines is high because people have become addicted to them
 inkaa jo impect he or effect he vah ek tarah se regular drug kii tarah se he or inkaa nuksaan bhi regular drug jaisaa hi he
 In the last one year itself, the Narcotics Control Department has seized more than 700 crore medicines which were to be sent abroad through online market
 inke alaava yah davaaiyaan jin tatwon se banati hai aise tatv bhi online bikate hai
 Such elements have been seized worth more than 2000 crores
 aisa lagane laga he ki drug taskari ab online tareeke se bhi bade paimaane par ho rahi he

 aath saal pehle steve wa ke ferewel test match main bharat ne jab australia ko drow ke liye majaboor kar diya tha, to mathew angel ne gardian main likhaa, ‘cricket ke aasmaan par kuch nae sitare chamak rahe hai
 This constellation can be seen with open eyes in the middle order of India - Rahul Dravid, Man of the Series, Sachin Tendulkar, V
 ve
 s
 lakshmana or saurav ganguli
 It seems that these will illuminate Test cricket in the coming years
 ’or aisa hi hua
 All these made India a master of cricket within a decade
 lekin in sardiyon main jab inaki vaapasi australia main hui, to samoochaa desh inhen dekhakar sadame main tha
 Fresh with renewed vigor, the Australian team turned the glow of Indian stars into darkness
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki tendulkar, dravid or lakshmana ko lekar bharatiyon kii saraahna sanak kii had tak chali jaati he
 There is no doubt that people's feelings are now calling for their downfall
 iske baavjood is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki inhone ek aisi team kii kismat hi palat di thi jisane aaajeevan chhitput kamyaabi ke alaava kuch bhi hasil nahin kiya tha
 For example, consider a few facts: Before Laxman's international Test debut in November 1996, India played 299 matches, won 55 and lost 98
 tab se lekar ab tak 163 match hue hai jinamein bhartiya team ko 57 main jeet mili he or 49 main haar
 If England and Australia had not lost, the figure would have been even more effective
 jin test maichon main ye teenon milakar khele, is tikdi ne 67 shatak banaae, jinamein adhiktar ne pichley dashak main hui jeet main kendriya bhoomika nibhaai or duusare deshon main bhartiya team par kharaab pradarshan ke thappe ko dhone main madad kii
 It is a matter of concern that old bad days are returning and batting is faltering
 ve sari kamajoriyaan ab is team main najar aa rahi hai jinase kabhi bharat ko pahachaanaa jaataa tha
 Then what is the way forward? Obviously, bringing new faces to bring freshness to the team will be decisive
 tendulkar, dravid or lakshmana bhale kabhi sanyas lene kii ghoshnaa karen, unki jagah lene vaale khilaadiyon kii pahchaan karke unhen khud ko is team kaa hissaa maanane ke liye paryaapt samay diya janaa chahie
 Since everyone, from the spectators to the experts, is questioning Dhoni's captaincy in Test matches, the leadership ability of others will also have to be tested
 kuch halkon main up-captain virendra sahvaag kaa naam liya ja rahaa he, lekin ek aise vyakti ko captaini dene kaa koi matlab nahin jo 33 saal kaa ho or maujuuda captain se teen saal bada ho
 Apart from this, Sehwag has not done any special performance in recent months, so that it can be assumed that he will be able to fulfill this responsibility in the five-day matches
 agar kuch maheene pehle yah baat uthati to swaabhaavik pasand gautam gambhir hote, lekin ek to kharaab form or upar se gharelu maidan par milane vaale phaayde se jude kuch arajak bayanon ke chalate unka patta kamjor he
 If change is to be made, Gambhir will still be the best option, with whom 23-year-old Virat Kohli, who captained the under-19s, stands, although he is still busy making his place
 jo bhi ho, sheersh kram main badlaav to karnaa hi hoga
 In the last 12 months, Gambhir and Sehwag's performance has not been special and Sehwag has expressed his desire to come in the middle order anyway, provided some place is vacant there
 chhathwein number par puraani gend ke saath vah vaisaa hi bartaav kar sakate hai jaisaa nai gend ke saath karte aae hai
 Don't forget that he made his first century in Bloemfontein, South Africa in 2001, while batting at sixth position
 gambhir kaa saath dene ke liye kohli ke alaava kai anya ummidavaar dikhte hai
 Mumbai's 23-year-old opener Ajinkya Rahane 68 in first class cricket
 47 kaa ausat he or ve apni jimmedaari nibhaa le jaaenge
 He was tested in England during the limited overs and anyone who saw him believes that it is a long race horse
 rahane ne us match main kuch behad aakarshak strokes jamaaye the
 The heart of the team is the middle order and in Australia this heartbeat stopped suddenly
 is kram main har jagah par vishisht kshamta vaale khilaadiyon kii jarurat hoti he or khilaadiyon ko is kram main mauka diya janaa chahie
 At the moment, the third man needs a man who can handle the innings and also can score runs fast
 ekadivasiy cricket main kohli ne yah kaam achche se kiya he or australia test main bhi majboot pradarshan ke chalate is number par unki daavedaari majboot hui he
 Whoever comes in place of Tendulkar at number four should have the ability to apply strong strokes
 mumbai ke 24 varshiya rohit sharma ko aaj kaa sabase hunarmand ballebaaj maanane vaale akele ian chapel hi nahin hai
 Nobody doubts his ability
 unhen pichley saal vishwa cap main jagah nahin mil pai, haalanki tab se lekar ab tak ekadivasiy cricket main unki raah main jitne bhi maukey aae hai, unhone usamen khud ko sabit kiya he
 The delay in taking them in the Test team will be harmful for the entire Indian cricket
 iske alaava ek or nirnaayak jagah chhathvaan number he, jahaan lakshmana ne kai baar apni veerta dikhaai he
 Batting in the lower order is the most difficult task
 is sthaan par aag ugalane vaali gendbaaji ke khilaaf ballebaaj ko ek to dhaal chahie hoti he, duusare unhen aatmavishvaas bhi dilaanaa hota he taaki ve apana swaabhaavik pradarshan kar saken, jaisaa ki lakshmana ne 23 varshiya eshanth sharma ke saath aktubar 2010 main mohali main kiya tha
 The player must be relaxed to play this role
 iske udhaaharan ke taur par sava saal pehle australia test main madhya kram ke saurashtra se aane vaale 24 saal ke ballebaaj cheteshwar pujaara kii pari yaad kii ja sakati he
 Fifth place needed another left-handed batsman
 agle satr kii shuruyaat tak yadi yuvaraj singh khilne laayak ho jate hai to unhen is sthaan par daawa jataane kaa aakhri mauka dena hoga
 If not, then 25-year-old Suresh Raina of Uttar Pradesh is already ready
 short ball ke khilaaf raina asahaj rahete hai, is par unki kaaphi aalochana bhi hui he, lekin unase behatar khilaadiyon ko bhi aisi dikkatein jhelni padi hai
 Raina plays a central role especially in India's fielding and no one has questioned his ability to work till date
 ek anya dilachasp vikalp tamilnadu ke openar 22 varshiya abhinav mukund hai
 His experience on foreign grounds is good and the domestic record is also tremendous
 parichit paristhitiyon main ekaadh siries khilne ke baad ve bhartiya test team ke liye taiyaar maane ja sakate hai
 If there is any other consolation apart from Kohli on the defeat in Australia, then he is 27 year old Riddhiman Saha
 mushkil halaat main ve ballebaaji bhi kar sakate hai, aisa unhone australia main sabit kar diya
 If Dhoni withdraws in future, there is no doubt that Saha can be a better option as a wicket-keeper batsman
 vaapasi kii raah harbhajan singh bhi dekh rahe hai, lekin chayankartaaon ko gambhirtha se daaen haath ke of brake gendbaaj 25 varshiya aar
 Will have to think about Ashwin
 australia main 62
 His record of 9 wickets at the rate of 77 may not be very impressive, but then you should also think about Muttiah Muralitharan how he struggled with the conditions there (75 in five Tests
 41 kii dar se 12 wicket)
 For the off-spinners, the situation has always been the same, although Ashwin should be given the command of a spin attack from India as he deserves it at home
 jahaan tak tej gendbaaji kaa sawaal he, halaat or mushkil hai
 Zaheer Khan played Test in Australia for the first time, but his race is not too long now
 eshanth sharma ummid ke mutabik sudhaar nahin kar sake hai
 Umesh Yadav, 24, also did not instill any confidence in himself
 unhen or 22 varshiya varun eron ko tej gendbaaji par dhyaan lagane ke liye kaha janaa chahie jabaki 25 varshiya praveen kumaar or 27 varshiya irfan pathan jarurat padane par swing aajamaa sakate hai
 Overall, one can say that there is no need to raise too much expectations
 chijen behatar hone se pehle or ladkadaayengi or ek baat tay he ki naujavaanon kii upeksha kar ke bhartiya cricket kahin kaa nahin rah jayega
 It took 20 matches for Laxman to establish his foothold in Test cricket, obviously those who come after him will also have to give that much time and opportunity so that they can linger in it

 com / 11zv2zcrvb Chief Justice of the country SH Kapadia has said that if there is constructive criticism of the actions and decisions of the judges, then they should not ignore them, because the law is developed by such reviews
 kapaadiya ne yah baat mangalvaar ko us samay kahi, jab vah pramukh kanoonvid tiaar andhyarugina kii pustak 'da keshavanand bharti cese : da antold story of stregal for supermesi bai da supreme court and parliament' kaa vimochan kar rahe the
 Kapadia said, "we judges are not afraid of constructive criticism by the bar of its actions and decisions
 " kapaadiya ne is baat par khed jataayaa ki varisht adhivaktaa vaidhanik or sanvaidhanik kanoon ke vikaas par dhyaan dene kii bajaae apane peshewar kaaryo main kuch zyada hi jute hue hai
 The CJI refused to be part of any discussion on the issue that judges should not get involved in debated issues
 baharhaal, is pustak main keshavanand bharti maamle main tanaavon or sangharsho ke vivaran shaamil hai- na keval pratidwandvi pakshon ke bich, balki nyaayadhishon ke bich bhi
 The views of some of them were predetermined, as they had been judges in earlier cases and secondly that the government had selected them
 andhyarugina ne kaha ki pustak is baat kaa sachcha chitra prastut karti he ki kaise maamla viksit hua or iske saath kaise nipta gaya or kisi tarah sandigdh tareeke se nirnay par pahunchaa gaya
 Andhyarujina's arguments in this case are based on her memories and comments made by her as the case's lawyer, and later on interviews with some judges related to the case she took
 is maamle main sarvocch nyaayalay ne kaha tha ki sansad, samvidhan ke buniyadi dhaanche ke saath chhedchhad nahin kar sakati
 Was the famous Vidyasagar bridge inaugurated by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in West Bengal? If the Congress believes, then yes
 ye baat alag he ki is sethu kaa udghaatan 10 oktober yani aaj hi ke din 1992 main hua tha, jabaki indira gandhi kii hatya isse thik chah saal pehle oktober ke maheene main hi 31 taarikh ko ho chuki thi
 Yes, the Congress posted several posts on its official Facebook page today with # thisdaythatyear
 ek main usne aaj hi ke din kailash satyaarthee ko 2014 kaa nobel puraskaar milane kaa zikr kiya to duusare main 2008 main tatkaaleen videsh mantri pranab mukherjee kaa america form ke saath bharat main parmaanu takanic bechney sambandhi samjhaute kaa
 Under this hashtag, the Congress wrote that on this day in 1992, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi inaugurated Vidyasagar Setu in 1992
 subah 8
 While doing this post written at 15 pm, the social media cell of the Congress forgot that Narasimha Rao, not Indira Gandhi, was the Prime Minister at that time and he was the one who inaugurated the bridge
 indira gandhi kii hatya to chah saal pehle 1984 main hi ho gai thi or wo bhi oktober kaa hi maheenaa tha
 Apparently, as soon as these posts were made, the users started to drag the Congress on how Indira Gandhi could inaugurate this bridge and if the media cell of the Congress wants to tell the history to the public then why does it not update itself first
 takreeban 12 baje congress ko apni is galati kaa ahsaas hua or phir is post ko edit kar likhaa gaya ki 1992 main pi ve narsinha raav ne is sethu kaa udghaatan kiya tha jabaki isaki aadharshila 20 may 1972 ko indira gandhi ne rakhi thi
 a facebook user quipped, who had gone to heaven to invite Indiraji in 1992
 khaas baat ye he ki fasebuk post ko edit karne ke baavjood uski puraani post ko dekhne kaa vikalp maujuud rahata he
 In this post too, the Congress's lapse can be seen in its edit history, but the good thing is that the Congress soon realized its mistake and rectified it

 Jaishankar, tell you that everyone was surprised to see s Jaishankar when the Modi government was sworn in
 unhone isse pehle videsh mantralay main bataur sachiv kaam kiya he lekin aaj vah videsh mantri hai
 Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, who retired this year, is known for the longest 36 years of foreign service
 unhone dilli ke saint steffens college se snaatak or jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay (jeenyu) se international relation main eme kiya he

 The story of the film 'what the Fish' begins with Dimple Kapadia's character Sudha, who goes to her beautiful house 30 days ago, after surrendering to her relative
 
 
 or chetavanee detii hai ki unke ghar or unke fishpot kaa acchhee tarah khyal rakhaa jaae
 
 
 But for some reason or other, their house goes into the hands of one and second to third and everyone uses that house in their own way
 
 
 har baar unki sundar-si machhlee mar jaati he or uski jagah waisi hi dikhne vaali nai machhlee laakar pot main daal di jaati he
 
 
 But, whether he will get Sudha's house back, he will have to see in the film 'what the Fish'
 
 
 dimpal kapaadiya ek gussell mahila ke role main hai, jinke liye film main kuch khaas karne ko nahin he
 
 
 The bus, scolding the taxi driver while coming back into the house and after coming in the house is the only job for them
 
 
 phone par huzzat karnaa or phir kahani ko flashbek main le janaa, ki 25 din pehle is ghar main kya hua tha, yaa 20 din pehle is ghar main kya hua tha
 
 
 Similarly, she is seen talking on four to five phones in between
 
 
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki dimpal ne film ke promoshan ke samay hi saaf kah diya tha ki is film main unhone paison ke liye kaam kiya he
 
 
 To say it is a situational comedy, but the film has little laugh
 
 
 kahani kahaan se kahaan jaati he, yah samaj se baahar he
 
 
 You will say the same thing every time, what is it and how is it done
 
 
 yaa yah kya chal rahaa he
 
 
 The only thing worthy of praise in the film is performance
 
 
 dimpal kapaadiya ke saath-saath sabhi kalakaaron ne acha abhinay kiya he
 
 
 'what the Fish' is a weak film with no story, no comedy, no subject to think about
 
 
 main is film ko kuch 'zyada hi' nambar de rahaa hum, kyonki diarector gurmeet singh ne bina kahani ke film banane kii koshish kii he
 
 
 My rating for the film 'what the Fish' is 1
 5 star

 It is quite possible that this country becomes a witness to hosting the biggest political event of the year 2018
 ye desh he mongolia
 It is reported that North Korean dictator Marshall Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump may meet in Mongolia
 is silsile main korian rajdoot or america adhikariyon ne mongolian raashtrapati ke chif of staff se mulaakaat bhi kii he
 In the big world, there is no one place where Trump can meet Kim, avoiding Trump and Kim from each other's locations
 duniya par mandaraaye tisare vishwayuddh ke khatre ko khatm karne ke liye in donon netaaon kii mulaakaat may ke aakhir yaa june ke shuruuaati hafte main honi he
 But Trump is abstaining from North Korea, and Kim is afraid of going to America
 vahiin dakshin korea, japan, rus or china par donon mulkon kii suraksha agenciyon ko aitaraaz he
 So Stockholm, the capital of the European country Sweden, was discussed
 zyada lambii udaan ke kaabil nahin kim kaa planehalanki tatasth hone ke saath-saath sweden se donon deshon ke rishte bhi thik hai
 But there is a problem here too
 america raashtrapati to apane airforce-van vimaan se sweden pahunch jaaenge
 There are many characteristics in it
 is par to missile hamale kaa bhi asar nahin hota
 But Kim's official plane, which is called 'air Force Un', is not even capable of traveling over 3200 km without oil again
 kim ke paas he baba aadam ke jamaane kaa placeismen shaq nahin he ki kim ne 13 hazaar kimi tak maar karne vaali misile taiyaar kar lee hai
 6-6 atomic bombs and no idea how many weapons have been created
 magar aaj ke jamaane main bhi kim baba aadam ke jamaane kaa vimaan istemaal karata he or kim kaa ye aadhikarik plane ek baar main mahaz 2000 mile ke daayre tak hi udaan bhar saktaa he
 To go beyond this, oil has to be filled twice in the aircraft
 ab ek to kim ko plane se dar or doosraa suraksha kaa bhi khatra aise main 2000 mile yani 3200 kimi ke daayre main hi kisi aisi jagah ko final karnaa padegaa jahaan kim or trump kii mulaakaat ho sake
 The countries that come within 3200 km radius of kim-trump may be in Mongolia, including China, Japan, Russia, Taiwan, South Korea and Mongolia
 china or rus main america nahin milanaa chahega or dakshin korea or japan main kim ko apni suraksha kaa khatra he
 Kim has no leisure over Taiwan
 to le dekar mongolia hi ek aisa desh bachataa he, jahaan maujuuda vakt kii ye sabase badi raajnneeti mulaakaat ho sakati he
 The great thing is that both countries also have good relations with Mongolia
 haalanki mongolio ko itani badi mulakaaton kaa tajurba thodaa kam he
 Trump and Kim's envoys from Mongolian officials because often the country does not respond much to global events
 lekin bataaya ja rahaa he ki mongolia is mulaakaat ko apni dharti par karaane main kaaphi ruchi le rahaa he
 In this connection, the Chief of Staff of Mongolian President Khaltama Batulga has also met the Nekorian Ambassador and US officials
 badi baat ye he ki mongolia aisa vikalp he jahaan kaa safar karne main kim jong ko naa to suraksha kaa koi khatra hoga or naa hi koi aitaraaz
 Other options are also being considered! Not yet decided, instead of meeting Mongolia, Sweden, Switzerland can also be an option
 kyonki yahaan se na sirf kim ne apni schuli padhai kii he
 Rather, the two countries also have better relations with him
 tamaam jaankaar bhi is baat par hami bhar rahe hai ki donon netaaon kii ye mulaakaat kisi tatsthya sthaan par hi honi chahie
 However, the news is that if there is no talk, then these blue buildings can be fixed for the meeting
 jinhen panmunjom kaha jaataa he, jo uttar or dakshin korea ke border par he
 It is not being considered at the moment because neither North Korea nor America wants any third intervention in this conversation
 jammu-kashmir ke sopor main shuukravaar subah suraksha balon or aatankiyon kii muthbhed main donon dehshatgard dher ho gaye hai
 However, there was a clash between the local people and the security forces after this
 bataaya jaataa he ki aatankiyon ke maare jane ke baad aasapaas ke gaanv se badi sankhya main yuvak encounter vaale ilaake main jamaa ho gaye
 They also threw stones at the security forces
 police ne bheed ko teetar-bitar karne ke liye aansu gas ke gole chode
 It is said that the security forces were informed about the hideout of the terrorists, after which a search operation was started in Bommai village
 kareeb ghante bhar kii khojbin ke baad aatanki ek ghar main chhipe hue paae gaye
 Earlier, the security forces started moving, firing from the terrorists from the other side
 samay rahete suraksha balon ne bhi javaabi karrwai shuru kar di
 During this time both the comers have been killed
 aatankiyon kaa sambandh hijbul mujahidin se he

 While 10 police constables have been suspended

 Senior Superintendent of Police of Mathura Rakesh Singh said Santosh Kumar Yadav, in-charge of Police Station beyond Kiyumuna, has been moved to the line and 10 constables from different police stations have been suspended
 in sabhi ko mangalvaar kii shaam sabji mandi tirahaa ke paas radha kunda main ahoi ashtami ke kaarykram main duty par lagaaya gaya tha
 There these people did not perform their duty properly
 jis kaaran kshetra main ek sand ghus aayaa or usne kuch logon ko ghayal kar diya tha
 The SSP said that in the meantime, orders have been given against the in-charge of Baldev police station, who was recently accused of assaulting a married woman
 input- bhashaa But it is also true that if Rahul Gandhi does not step down, it will be difficult for the Congress to recover, because it seems that the Congress under Rahul's leadership has done its best
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke samayjab rahul gandhi ko congress adhyaksh banaaya gaya tha or tabaibhjhf koparty ne kadi takkar di thi
 The Congress formed the government in Karnataka and subsequently won elections in December 2018 in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan
 lekin uske baad rahul loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main safal ranneeti banane main kaamyaab nahin ho paae or teenon rajyon main mili badhat bhi ganvaa baithe
 Now it was the fault of Rahul Gandhi or his team or both, it will have to be reviewed by the party itself, but it is decided that not joining the SP-BSP-RLD alliance in Uttar Pradesh was a big strategic lapse
 isi tarah anya rajyon main bhi kshetreey partiyon se congress kii baat nahin ban pai
 On the other hand, the BJP, while giving up its winning seats with a big heart, aligned with the JDU in Bihar, in Maharashtra in a similar manner with the Shiv Sena
 to sawaal yah he ki aakhir rahul gandhi ko salaah dene waalon ne bada dil kyon nahin dikhaaya, jabaki vah vipakshi ekta ke naam par gathbandhan kii aguwai kaa bhi elaan kar chuke the
 It seems, even though Rahul Gandhi has been in politics for 15 years, he is still far away from the ground reality and he does not understand the reality of the figures
 lekin congress ke saamne sabase bada sankat he ki gandhi parivaar ke alaava unke paas koi cheharaa nahin he jo aam logon ko aakarshith kar sake
 Then who should be given the reins? It seems to me that the time has come for the Congress and the Gandhi family to make a big time
 party kii kaman unhen aise shaks ko deni chahie jo sabhi tarah ke chunavi aankade, rajanithik chaalo or sanghathan ko khadaa kar chalaane kii kshamta rakhata ho
 Who believes that Congress is the only party in which all ideas can be integrated
 meri baat thodaa ajeeb jarur lag sakati he lekin mere hisaab se is samay yogendra yadav hi congress kii bagdor sanbhaalane kii sabase badi kshamta rakhte hai
 He also consults with Nehru's socialist thinking
 vah hindi bolne main bhi galati nahin karenge
 He is also disappointed with the performance of the Congress and believes that the present Congress is the biggest obstacle in becoming an alternative to BJP
 vah congress ko puraani congress banane kii baat karte hai or yah madda kam se kam abhi kisi congress netaa main nahin dikhataa he
 But this does not mean that Yogendra Yadav should become the face of Congress
 rahul gandhi khud ko piem pad kaa ummidavaar bataate hue puure desh kaa daura karen or unke liye ranneeti banane kaa kaam yogendra yadav karen jo ki jameen se judakar kisaan kii aawaaj uthaate hai or inhen muddon se judaa sanghathan bhi chalaate hai
 Apart from this, all other big leaders of Congress should send them to their state
 ve sabhi apane-apane rajyon main jaakar yogendra yadav kii salaah par congress ke sanghathan ko majboot karne kaa kaam karen
 If the Congress has to stand again, it will have to be so big
 nahin to oxford or harvard se padhe salaahkaar jo jamini hakeekat se bilkul kate hue hai,party kii aisi hi mitti paleed karaate rahenge

 This useless rant of the Pak government is also not being liked by the media there

 If the government of Pakistan still adopts the pretext, then it is certain that along with the world, it will also make it gritty among its people

 BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani denied the allegations that Sardar Patel was anti-muslim
 is sambandh main unhone ek islamic vidwaan or congress netaa rafique jakaaria ko uddhrut kiya jinhone 'louh purush' kii rashtravaadi chhavi ko ujagar karne ke liye un par shodh kiya he
 Advani expressed surprise at a 'perverted' article published in a national magazine in his blog, citing the inscription as a symbol of Patel as a 'strong communal figure' and Jawaharlal Nehru as a symbol of 'secular nationalism'
 lekh main kaha gaya he ki yahi vajah he ki sangh parivaar ‘ek kii puja karata he or duusare se ghrinaa karata he
 The veteran BJP leader, in complete denial, offered the views of Zakaria, who is considered a master of subjects related to Indian Muslims
 jakaaria ke vyakhyanon par aadhaarit unki kitaab ‘sardaar patel and indian muslim’ kaa hawala dete hue adwani ne kaha ki congress ke netaa bhi isi khyaal main the ki patel muslimon ko pasand nahin karte the
 Zakaria wrote, 'I used to think that he (patel) is anti-muslim
 kya main sahi hum yah pataa lagane ke liye maine unki smriti main yojit vyakhyanon kaa adhyayan kiya, jisamen unke bare main aalochanatmak drushtikon bhi ho saktaa tha
 'advani wrote in his blog quoting Zakaria's book,' The more i discovered, the more i became convinced that the Iron Man was misunderstood in many aspects and about his attitude towards Indian Muslims
 There are misconceptions that need to be removed
 mujhe khushi he ki main apni tasalli kii had tak aisa karne main safal rahaa
 Zakaria says that former Indian Advocate General Fali Nariman has written to him that he enjoyed listening to his lectures, Justice Chapalgaonkar of the Mumbai High Court has a similar view
 jakaaria likhte hai, ‘bahut se or logon kaa bhi khyaal he ki main bhartiya muslimon ke prati patel ke ravaie kaa vastunishth vishleshan karne main safal rahaa, jisaki sampradayik jehar se dooshit ho chuke maujuuda halaat main bhi bahut jarurat he

 Pujara could not take advantage of this and he gave an easy catch to Leon after four overs

 After this, Pant and Jadeja put the Australian bowlers in trouble

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi also held a press conference on Wednesday in the Lok Sabha over the Rafael case after he surrounded Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 is dauraan unhone modi sarkaar ko rafel saude main karpshan ke liye jimmedaar bataaya or vitt mantri arun jetali ke loksabhaa main die bhaashan par palatwaar kiye
 Meanwhile, on a question, Rahul Gandhi said that yes i am a pilot, but i do not have a current license
 rahul gandhi apane parivaar ke koi iklaute sadsy nahin hai jinhen plane udaane kaa tajurba he
 His father and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and his uncle Sanjay Gandhi have also been pilots
 rajeev gandhi ne vimaan chaalak kaa kariyar chunaa or is kshetra main chote vimaan se shuru karke bade-bade bowing vimaan tak udaae
 Rajiv Gandhi returned to India from Britain in 1966 and took up the post of professional pilot in Indian Airlines
 aamtaur par rajeev gandhi dilli-jaipur-agra root par vimaan udaate the
 This route was not considered easy in those days
 kaha jaataa he ki rajeev gandhi indian airlines ke adhyaksh banane kii daud main bhi shaamil rahe, lekin yah us dauraan mumkin nahin ho sakaa tha
 However, he did not open any private aircraft company of his own
 baharhaal bataa den ki rahul gandhi ke chachaa sanjay gandhi bhi payalat the
 It is said that Sanjay Gandhi was a man of simplicity
 vah kolhapuri chappalon main hi vimaan udaane lagate the, jabaki ye chappalein cockpit main hawa ke ucch dabaav ko jhelane main sakasham nahin thim
 Rajiv Gandhi also used to warn him again and again that he should blow up the planks only with the shoes of the pilot
 lekin sanjay unki baat par dhyaan nahin dete the
 But who knew that this tough man would die in a plane crash
 23 june 1980 ko plane krash main unki jaan chali gai
 For Argentina, this World Cup has been nothing short of a nightmare yet
 argentina jahaan apane pehle match main nai team iceland ko nahin haraa saki or muqabla 1-1 ke barabari par chuta jabaki duusare match main kroeshia kii team ne argentina ko 3-0 se maat de di
 In the first two matches of Argentina, Lionel Messi, one of the best footballers, did not appear in color and after the defeat to Croatia, now Argentina are also in danger of being eliminated from the first round
 agar aisa hota he to yah sambhawatah apana aakhri vishwacap khel rahe mesi ke sapane ke tut jane sareekha bhi hoga
 Although everything is still not over for Argentina, Nigeria's victory in the match played between Iceland and Nigeria gave Argentina a lifeline
 agar kismat ne argentina or mesi kaa saath diya to argentina kii team abhi bhi agle daur main jagah bana sakati he
 However, for now the results of the remaining matches of Group d will have to be favorable for Argentina
 abhi group di kaa jo sameekaran he usamen argentina 1 ank ke saath aakhri paaydaan par he, jabaki kroeshia 6 ankon ke saath agle daur main pahunch chuki he
 On the other hand, Nigeria is in third place with 3 points while Iceland with 1 point
 ab is group ke aakhri do muqablon main nigeria kii team argentina se bhidegi jabaki iceland kaa muqabla kroeshia se hoga
 So if: - Croatia's team defeats Iceland and Argentina, Nigeria, then Argentina will reach the next round with 4 points
 · agar argentina, nigeria ko haraa de or iceland, kroeshia se jeet bhi jaae to donon tiimon ke baraabar ank ho jaaenge, haalanki abhi tak argentina ne zyada gol khaae hai aise main use iskaa nuksaan bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Meaning in the current situation, Argentina can open the way to their next round with a big win in their last match
 aise main ab agle agle match main yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki kya mesi apni team or apane khud ke sapane ko bachaane ke liye koi yaadgaar pradarshan kar pate hai yaa nahin

 Let's take a look at what are the issues of Lokpal Bill, on which there can be a dispute between the government and Anna
 pehla he nyaaypalika kaa mudda
 Anna and her supporters want the judiciary to be included in this bill as well
 lekin sarkaar ke mutabik samvidhan is baat kii anumati nahin detaa
 Hazare supporters want the Lokpal to be at the top
 uske paas pradhanmantri or mukhya nyaayadhish ko bhi pad se hataane kii takat ho
 But according to the constitution, the Prime Minister can be removed only by the President if there is no majority and the Chief Justice has to be impeached in Parliament to be removed from the post
 teesraa mudda he lokapal fund kaa
 Hazare wants the fine to be deposited in the Lokpal Fund, while all the money seized goes to the same government fund
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki aise main har samiti har sanstha apana khud kaa fund maangane lagegi
 The fourth issue is the accountability of the complainant
 hajaare samarthak chaahate hai ki shikaayat galat pai jane ke baavjood shikayatakarta ke khilaaf koi karrwai na ho, lekin sarkaar chaahati he ki shikayatakarta kii koi na koi javabdehi ho
 (also from input language) kai baar javaanon or kisaanon kii haalat dekhakar lagata he ki ham sab zid par ade hai ki inaki taraf dekhnaa hi nahin he
 The problem is so big that in the name of a solution, a pudding is introduced which disappears as a headline in the media

 dhai karod aavedan ek lakh padon ke liye aae hai
 Look at a picture taken by our colleague Amitesh
 aadmi kab insaan ho jaataa he, kab saamaan ho jaataa he, yah is par nirbhar karata he ki uski jeb main kitne rupee hai
 These young soldiers will protect us as soldiers, but before that they can see what inhuman process they are going through
 malgadee ke pichley dibbe par ladaaye fadaaye chale ja rahe hai
 Remember the scene of this freight train going towards Mughalsarai
 acchhee baat he ki in naujavaanon kii raajnneetik chetana shunya he varanaa hamaare netaaon ko tharthari ho jaati
 The young corpses of India are peace-filled youth who should be seen just advertising a job
 khandhar main badal chuke college nahin dikhte hai, college ke bheetar ghatiya teacher nahin dikhte hai
 We see nothing from you
 hamane ram manohar lohia avadh uniwarsity ke bie biessi, bi com or post graduate ke riselt ke bare main bataaya tha
 There is a procession of those who failed there
 vishvavidhyalay ne is saal pariksha ke dauraan nakal rokane ke liye camere laga die
 The copying has stopped, but the number of people who fail and leave the examination is telling that this university is of no use
 yahaan padhane vaale or naam likhaa kar nahin padhane vaale chaatro ko pataa he ki kahaan professor aate hai, kahaan padhaate hai or kahaan sirf naam likhaaya jaataa he, pariksha paas karaayaa jaataa he or padhai nahin hoti he
 It is not just about Avadh University, we have Jaypee University of Chapra and Dr
 of Muzaffarpur in prime time
 ambedkar bihar uniwarsity kaa bhi haal bataaya tha
 We had told in prime time that around six lakh students appeared in the examination at Awadh University and eighty percent of them failed
 yani 4 lakh 80 hazaar ke kareeb fail ho gaye
 The university released a press release on June 19, presenting the data in such a way that everything looks good
 is relies main likhaa he ki pariksha par prashn chinh lagaaya ja rahaa he
 We had put a question mark on the education here, what is the quality of studies that the number of people who fail to reach copying reaches millions
 kul milakar aankadon kii bazigaari kii gai he
 The difference between the percentage of government-funded colleges and the percentage of self-run colleges has been reported
 hamane overol jodakar bataaya tha ki 2017-18 main bie biessi, bi com ke teenon saal ke or post graduate str ke sava chah lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi
 If 80 percent failed, then about 4 lakh 80,000 students failed due to this
 biessi third year ke 80 pratishat se adhik chaatr fail hai
 In BSC first year, 56 percent students have failed
 sultanpur ke ganpat sahay post graduate mahavidhyalay ke ganit main final year main kareeb 300 chaatr the lekin inamen se maatr 20-25 chaatr paas hue hai
 Nearly 275 have failed
 19 june ko vaais chancelar ne ek meeting kar aankadon ko is tarah pesh kiya he jisase na lage ki chaar lakh bachche fail ho gaye
 Our emphasis is on why the quality of studies is so poor that students leave or fail in the name of stopping copying
 ham kab tak bhaagenge is sawaal se kya tab tak jab tak bharat ke saare noujvaan barbaad nahin kar die jate
 The June 19 press release lists the number of BA bcom BAC students and their percentages, but the pass percentage has been distributed among government-funded and self-funded institutions so that it does not look as if studying in government institutions Level is poor
 biessi dwitiya varsh main 23,358 chaatr shaamil hue or 20 pratishat safal hue
 Is it not shameful that 80 percent of the students fail? In BSC III year, 34,091 students attended and 19
 18 pratishat chaatr safal hue
 Is it not shameful that more than 80 percent of the students fail? 77,259 students attended and 59 in BA First Year
 95 pratishat paas hue
 Is it not shameful that 40 percent of the students fail? 61,610 students attended the BA Second Year and 79
 86 pratishat paas hue
 Isn't it embarrassing for 20 percent of the students to fail? 40,442 students attended and 43 in bsc first year
 01 pratishat paas hue
 Isn't it embarrassing for 57 percent of the students to fail? yahi khel he
 The percentage of students who failed is divided into government and private
 agar privet main rigelt itnaa kharaab he to vishvavidhyalay yah bataae ki vah kya ection lene ja rahaa he
 The pass percentage in government-funded colleges may be between 50 and 70 percent in sight, but the failure of 20 to 40 percent students is also a question on its quality
 par ek baat samaj nahin ai
 On February 22, before the examination started, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Manoj Dixit, said in a press conference that this time six lakh 11 thousand 680 students will be included in the graduation examinations
 magar 19 june kii press release main jo hisaab diya he uske anusaar to pariksha dene vaale chaatro kii sankhya 3 lakh 31 hazaar 239 hi he
 We did not understand where the remaining 2 lakh 80 thousand 441 students went
 kya bibie or bisie jaise course kaa hisaab isamen se hataa diya gaya he taaki fail hone vaale chaatro kii total sankhya kam lage
 We had shown in the University Series that many colleges in Awadh University do not have sufficient number of teachers
 kai collejon main sirf kaagaj par hi hai vahaan padhai nahin hoti
 i raised this question not for myself but for the children of ordinary families of that poor area, why are they being given poor quality education
 ab uniwarsity ne kaha he ki 100 uttar pustikaon ke sample duusari uniwarsity main jaanch ke liye bheje jaaenge taaki isaki pushti ho sake ki jaanch main gadabadi to nahin hui he
 There will be no fee for this and students can apply to include their copy in this 100 copy if they wish
 kya yah ajeeb nahi he
 If five hundred students apply then what will the university do
 hamaara sawaal ek or he ek garib ilaake ke chaatro se uttar pustika kii jaanch ke liye 3000 rupee lenaa kahaan tak uchit he
 This system came into force 6 months ago or is implemented now
 It does not mean that the question of why 3000 rupees will be taken for investigation
 galati uniwarsity kii or paisa chaatr kaa
 The system here is to give Rs 300 first and then get a photo copy of the answer book
 usamen lagata he ki gadabadi hui he to phir 3000 hazaar dijie taaki jaanch ho
 What is the intelligence to earn money
 avadh uniwarsity hi nahin duusari kai uniwarsity main yah sab hone laga he
 Students raise questions but no one is listening
 avadh uniwarsity hi nahin aap june ke pehle saptaah ke hindi ke akhabaaron ko dekhie
 Magazine, Amar Ujala, Jagran, Hindustan
 bundelkhand vishvavidhyalay main 20 pratishat chaatr hi paas hue hai
 In BSC first year 88 percent students have failed
 privet collejon kaa riselt sabase kharaab rahaa he
 Think this is the condition of private colleges
 yahaan bhi dobaaraa copy check karaane ke liye 3000 rupee dene padate hai
 Copying has been stopped is a good thing, but the reality that has come out is worse than that
 in collejon kaa rigelt itnaa kharaab kyon hai
 The results of Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University of Kanpur are also showing that apart from stopping the copying, there is a need to pay attention to the quality of studies
 yah video kuch din purana he
 The students are angry at the failure and are demanding a re-examination of the answer sheet
 register sanjay kumaar ne bataaya biessi pratham varsh main 93 hazaar chaatr pariksha main shaamil hue the
 49 of these
 9 bachche hi paas hue hai
 38
 24 pratishat fail hue hai or 11 pratishat ke kareeb pariksha main baithe hi nahin
 In BSC Part Two, only 33 percent of the students could pass in 94620
 58 pratishat ke kareeb fail hue hai
 In BSC Third Year, close to 98 thousand students appeared in the examination, in which only 57% passed
 39 percent fail ho gaye
 One in 130 students passed out in a college in Kanpur Dehat
 ye haal he padhai kaa
 a committee was also formed on the demand of students that there was no disturbance in the assessment, but the committee has given a clean chit to the university
 kanpur uniwarsity ke biessi ke teenon saal main kul 1 lakh 28 hazaar chaatr fail hue hai
 Isn't this a serious issue? Now think what is going on in studies that so many students are failing
 ye bharat kii utpaadakta yaa arthvyavastha main kya yogadan karenge
 Between fifty thousand and one lakh lecturers professor positions are vacant in universities in India
 uniwarsity kaa prashasan khush he ki nakal nahin hone di lekin kya yah rone vaali baat nahin he ki college ke college chaatr fail ho gaye
 No one is accountable for what they have been taught
 kyon hamaare collejon kii padhai itani kharaab he ki chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 This question is from the three lecturers and students who are getting salaries
 kya chaatr samaj rahe hai ki ve apane saath kya kar rahe hai
 It is not just about Kanpur and Awadh University
 isi 4 june ko times of india main pankaj dabhol kii ek khabar chhapi he
 94 percent of IT graduates are not eligible for employment
 yah bayaan tech mahindra ke siio kaa he
 IT companies now have to open their own training centers
 chotii kii iti companiyaan maatr 6 pratishat iti ejeeniyar ko naukari par rakhti hai
 We have been hearing for many years that our engineers are not fit
 aam parivaar karz lekar bees-bees lakh fees dekar privet collejon main padhaa rahe hai or paas hone ke baad yah sunne ko mili ki 94 fisadi iti ejeeniyar naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai to yah kiske saath dhokhaa he
 Isn't it a robbery? kya maa baap or chaatr ke saath dhokhaa nahin hai
 Isn't it shameful that India's engineering education is so inferior that 94 per cent of engineers from its colleges are not fit to be hired? kya naujavaanon ke saath dhokhaa nahin ho rahaa he
 Did she study for free? behatar he apane sawaal badal len varanaa halaat nahin badalenge
 You know that students demonstrated outside the UP Public Service Commission in Allahabad
 inaki maang thi ki hindi kii pehali pari main duusari pari ke prashn patr bant gaye hai, isliye pariksha radd ho
 The Commission also canceled the examination but did only Hindi
 chaatr maang karne lage ki sari pariksha radd ho magar ayog kaa kahana tha ki ek hi centre par aisi gadabadi hui he, isliye baaki pariksha kyon radd karen
 Students were agitated about this, police charged lathi, arrested eight students
 ab inamen se saat chaatro ko chhod diya gaya he taaki ve 21 june kii pariksha main shaamil ho saken
 But the Samajwadi Party leader and former Allahabad University president Richa Singh has not been left out
 unhen jail bhej diya gaya he
 The comments bihar main 20 june ko dasvin kaa riselt aana tha
 More than 17 lakh students were waiting, but the result will now come on 26 June, because you were told that 42 thousand answer sheets have been stolen in Gopalganj district
 yahi haal kisaanon kaa he
 In Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, farmers have grown tomatoes in ten thousand bighas
 upi main sabase adhik tamaato amroha main hi hota he vaise aam bhi khub hota he
 The farmers here threw the tamaras on the side of the road, because the cost was not available even if they were sold
 30 kilo kaa ek cret hota he
 a few days ago, there was a crate of 80-90 rupees in the mandi here, that is, 2 to 3 rupees per kg, while it costs Rs 15 to grow one kg of tomatoes
 amroha se anwar kamaal kii is report ke baad jo rate main badlaav aayaa he usase ham bhi hairaan he
 a week ago, there was a crate price of 80 rupees, now 280 to 290 crates are available
 yani 8 rupee se 9 rupee kilo ke bhav mil rahe hai
 This is also less, but after a report, how the price has gone from 3 rupees to 9 rupees, we are unable to understand
 kisaan kah rahe the ki pichley saal pakistan niryaat ke kaaran khub bhav mila to is baar zyaada zamin kiraaye par lekar kheti kar lee
 In Amroha district, tomato cultivated in ten thousand bighas
 kai kisaan nuksaan ke kaaran karze main aa gaye hai
 Amroha is not far from Delhi
 vahaan kisaan ko ek kilo tamaato ke 10 rupee bhi nahin mil rahe hai lekin aaj hi dakshin dilli ke katwaria sarai main tamaato kaa bhav 50 rupee kilo tha
 There is a price of 44 rupees kg in the successful
 ab aap hi bataaiye amroha main kisaan ko 3 rupee kilo bhav nahin mil rahe hai, jabaki vah ek kilo tomaamar ugane main 15 rupee laga de rahaa he or dilli main 50 rupee kilo tamaato bik rahaa he
 You are also being plundered and the farmer is also being plundered
 phir yah koun he jo 47 rupee kaa munafa le ja rahaa he
 No one is offering concrete solutions to these questions
 raajnneeti gappabaazi main badal gai he
 You have to decide whether to listen to the chat or see the work
 aap railway stesan par chhitaraaye in naujavaanon ko dekhie
 His deep sleep should make a leader afraid of what he will do after waking up
 par netaaon ko in naujavaanon ne bharosa de diya he ki ve murda javaani ko dho rahe hai
 They are just announced the recruitment examination and then after that, they will spend three to three years waiting for the results
 18 june kii raat elahabaad stesan par ye noujvaan so rahe hai, kyonki agali subah sipaahi kii pariksha deni he
 These young people do not have the ability to stay in the city of Allahabad even in today's Bhatar
 plateform par raat guzaarane vaale in naujavaanon main se ek he jo jaag rahaa he
 He is waking up every second preparing for the next morning's exam so that this time he becomes a soldier
 naukari mil jaae
 Our leaders are constantly mocking the ambition of such youth
 ye ladki yahaan so rahi he, taaki subah jaag kar sawaalon ko hal karne kii sthiti main rahe
 You know that on 18 and 19 June, UP Police Recruitment Board conducted the examination for more than 40 thousand soldiers at 860 centers
 jiske liye 22 lakh ummidavaaron ne form bhare the
 During this time, such a crowd of youth came out from all around, which did not get any attention
 footpath or plateform par rashtriya paridhaan baniyaan pahane ye noujvaan stesan ke baahar so chuke hai
 This was the condition of the platform of Allahabad station as if a crowd of millions had reached on the occasion of Chhath or Holi
 prime time ke ek darshak ne vibhuti express ke asi coach kaa haal bheja he
 In B-1 coach, this young man is going to Patna sitting in a sack like a potato
 berojgaar naujavaanon kii garima kii kise paravhaan he
 You would say that this has been the case for many years
 kya yah agle kai saal tak yahi kehete rahenge yaa phir iskaa samaadhaan kabhi na kabhi khojenge
 When we asked the prime time viewer to send a video too, he sent it
 hamane ye tasviren isliye dikhain taaki aapako us bharat kaa andaaza ho jo rose ek adad naukari kii talash main footpaathon par so rahaa he
 So that our leaders will come and talk about this problem among you
 rajasthan patrika kii ek khabar dekh rahaa tha ki mahila va bal vikaas vibhaag main suparviser ke 180 padon ke liye kareeb chaar lakh aavedan aa chuke hai
 There are 2214 contenders for one seat
 itnaa taff compatishan he
 Job is not there
 haalat yah he ki saal bhar ke bheetar parikshaon ko karakar niyukti patr de dena chunauti ban gai he
 But also an excuse
 ab dekhie railway kii pariksha kab hogi kisi ko pataa nahin
 2
5 crore applications have come for one lakh posts
 philhal ek tasviir dekhie jise hamaare sahyogi amitesh ne lee he
 When a man becomes a human being, when he becomes a luggage, it depends on how much money he has in his pocket
 yahi jawan sipaahi banakar hamaari raksha karenge magar uske pehle ye kis amanviya prakriya se guzar rahe hai aap dekh sakate hai
 Ladday fadaye are going to the last compartment of the goods train
 mughalsarai kii taraf ja rahi is malgadee ke drishy ko yaad rakhiegaa
 It is good that the political consciousness of these youth is zero or our leaders would have trembled
 bharat ke yuva murda shanti se bhare noujvaan hai jinhen bas ek naukari kaa vigyaapan dikh janaa chahie
 Colleges that have been transformed into ruins are not visible, there are no inferior teachers within the college
 hamen or aapako bhi kuch nahin dikhataa he
 We had told about the results of BA bsc, b Com and Post Graduate of Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University
 vahaan fail hone waalon kii baraat nikali he
 The university installed cameras to prevent cheating during the exam this year
 nakal to ruuk gai magar fail hone vaale or imtahaan chhodane waalon kii sankhya bataa rahi he ki ye uniwarsity kisi kaam kii nahin he
 Students who study here and do not write names know where professors come, where they teach and where only names are written, exams are passed and no studies are done
 sirf avadh uniwarsity kii baat nahin he, hamane prime time main chhapra ke jepi uniwarsity or muzaffarpur ke dow
 Ambedkar had also told the condition of Bihar University
 hamane prime time main bataaya tha ki avadh uniwarsity main chah lakh ke kareeb chaatr pariksha main shaamil hue the or inamen se assi fisadi chaatr fail ho gaye
 That means around 4 lakh 80 thousand have failed
 uniwarsity ne 19 june ko ek press relies jari kar aankadon ko aise pesh kiya he ki sab kuch acha acha dikhe
 It is written in this release that a question mark is being put on the exam
 hamane yahaan kii padhai par prashn chinh lagaaya tha ki padhai kii kya quality he ki nakal rokane par fail hone vaale kii sankhya lakhon main pahunch jaati he
 Overall, the data is marketed
 sarkaar dwaara anudaan praapt collejon ke paas pratishat or khud se chalane vaale collejon ke paas pratishat main antar bataaya gaya he
 We had added that overall, in 2017-18, BA and b
sc, b
com three-year and post-graduate level six and a half million students took the exam
 80 pratishat fail ho gaye to is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya kareeb 4 lakh 80,000 ke kareeb chaatr fail hai
 Over 80 percent of BSC third year students fail
 biessi pratham varsh main 56 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 Ganapat Sahay Post Graduate College of Sultanpur had about 300 students in the final year in mathematics but only 20-25 of these have passed
 275 ke kareeb fail ho gaye hai
 On 19 June, the Vice Chancellor held a meeting and presented the data in such a way that four lakh children failed
 hamaara jor is par he ki padhai kii quality itani ghatiya kyon he ki chaatr nakal rokane ke naam par pariksha chhod dete hai yaa fail ho jate hai
 How long will we run away from this question until all the youth of India are destroyed
 19 june kii press relies main bie bikom birsi ke chaatro kii sankhya di gai he or unke paas pratishat die gaye hai, magar paas pratishat ko sarkari anudaan praapt or swany vitt poshit sansthaanon main baat diya gaya he taaki ye na lage ki sarkari sansthaanon main padhai kaa str kharaab he
 23,358 students joined the BSC second year and 20 percent were successful
 kya 80 fisadi chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? biessi tritiy varsh main 34,091 chaatr shaamil hue or 19
 18 percent of students were successful
 kya 80 pratishat se adhik chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? bie first year main 77,259 chaatr shaamil hue or 59
 95 percent passed
 kya 40 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? bie second year main 61,610 chaatr shaamil hue or 79
 86 percent passed
 kya 20 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? biessi pratham varsh main 40,442 chaatr shaamil hue or 43
 01 percent passed
 kya 57 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? This is the game
 fail hone vaale chaatro kaa pratishat sarkari or privet main baant diya gaya he
 If the result in private is so bad, then the university should tell what action it is going to take
 sarkari anudaan praapt collejon main paas pratishat bhale hi dekhne main 50 se 70 pratishat ke bich dikh rahaa he magar 20 se 40 pratishat chaatro kaa fail hona bhi uski clavity par sawaal he
 But one thing was not understood
 pariksha shuru hone se pehle 22 farvari ko vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati manoj dikshit ne press conference main kaha tha ki is baar snaatak str kii parikshaon main chah lakh 11 hazaar 680 chaatr shaamil honge
 But according to the calculation given in the press release of June 19, the number of students taking the exam is only 3 lakh 31 thousand 239
 hamen samaj nahin aayaa ki baaki ke 2 lakh 80 hazaar 441 chaatr kahaan gaye
 Has the calculation of courses like BBA and BCA been removed from it so that the total number of students who failed is reduced
 hamane uniwarsity series main dikhaaya tha ki avadh uniwarsity ke kai collejon main paryaapt sankhya main shikshak nahin hai
 Many colleges are only on paper, there is no education there
 yah sawaal maine apane liye nahin balki us garib ilaake ke saadhaaran pariwaron ke bacchon ke liye uthaaya tha ki aakhir unhen ghatiya quality kii shiksha kyon di ja rahi he
 Now the university has said that samples of 100 answer sheets will be sent to another university for examination so that it can be confirmed that there is no disturbance in the investigation
 iske liye fees nahin lagegi or chaatr chahen to is 100 copy main apni copy shaamil karaane kaa aavedan de sakate hai
 Isn't it strange? agar paanch sau chaatro ne aavedan kar diya to phir uniwarsity kya karegi
 Our question is another, how far is it appropriate to take Rs 3000 from students of a poor area to check the answer book
 yah vyavastha 6 maah pehle lagu hui yaa ab lagu hui isse matlab nahin he sawaal he ki 3000 rupee jaanch ke kyon liye jaaenge
 Mistake of university and money of student
 yahaan system yah he ki 300 rupee pehle dijie phir uttar pustika kii photo copy hasil kiijie
 If it seems that there is a disturbance then give 3000 thousand so that the investigation can be done
 kya hoshiyaari he paisa kamaane kii
 Not only Avadh University, this is happening in many other universities
 chaatr sawaal uthaate hai magar koi sunne vaala nahin he
 Not only Avadh University, you should look at the Hindi newspapers of the first week of June
 patrika, amar ujaalaa, jaagran, hindustan
 Only 20 percent students have passed in Bundelkhand University
 biessi pratham varsh main 88 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 The result of private colleges has been the worst
 sochie privet collejon kaa ye haal he
 Here, again, 3000 rupees have to be paid for a copy check
 nakal roak di gai acchhee baat he magar jo asaliyat saamne ai he wo usase bhi buree bhi baat he
 Why are the results of these colleges so bad? kanpur ke chhatrapati shahu ji maharaj vishvavidhyalay ke nattejey bhi bataa rahe hai ki nakal par roak ke saath saath padhai kii quality par dhyaan dene kii zarurat he
 This video is a few days old
 chaatr fail hone par naaraaz hai or uttar pustika kii dobaaraa jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 Registrar Sanjay Kumar told that 93 thousand students appeared in the examination in the first year of b
sc
 inamen se 49
 Only 9 children have passed
 38
 24 percent have failed and close to 11 percent have not appeared for the exam
 biessi part tu main 94620 main sirf 33 pratishat chaatr hi paas ho sake
 Close to 58 percent have failed
 biessi third year main 98 hazaar ke kareeb chaatr pariksha main baithe jisamen 57 percent hi paas hue
 39 percent failed
 kanpur dehaat ke ek college main 130 chaatro main se ek paas hua he
 This is the condition of studies
 chaatro kii maang par cameti bhi bani ki kahin moolyankan main gadabadi to nahin hui magar cameti ne uniwarsity ko clin chit diya he
 a total of 1 lakh 28 thousand students have failed in the three years of b
sc of Kanpur University
 kya yah gambhir masalaa nahin he? ab aap sochie ki kya padhai ho rahi he ki itane chaatr fail ho rahe hai
 What will these contribute to India's productivity or economy
 bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon main pachaas hazaar se ek lakh ke bich lekturer professor ke pad khaali hai
 The administration of the university is happy that it is not allowed to be copied, but is it not a cry that college students failed in college
 unhen kya padhaayaa gaya kya isaki javabdehi kisi kii nahin he
 Why our colleges are so poor that students are not able to pass
 yah sawaal vahaan vetan paa rahe professor lekturer or chaatro teenon se he
 Do students understand what they are doing with themselves? baat sirf kanpur or avadh uniwarsity kii nahin
 On June 4, a news of Pankaj Dabhol appeared in the Times of India
 94 fisadi iti graduate naukari dene ke laayak nahin hai
 This statement is from the CEO of Tech Mahindra
 iti companiyon ko ab apana training centre kholana padaa he
 Top IT companies employ only 6 percent of IT engineers
 ham yah baat kai saal se sun rahe hai ki hamaare ejeeniyar kisi laayak nahin hai
 Common families are paying twenty-two million fees in private colleges by paying loans and after passing it is heard that 94% of IT engineers are not fit to be hired, then with whom is this cheating? kya yah dakaiti nahin he
 Are parents and students not cheated? kya yah sharmnaak nahin he ki bharat kii ejineering kii shiksha itani ghatiya he ki iske collejon se paas 94 fisadi ejeeniyar naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai
 Are the youth not being deceived? kya usne muft main padhai kii thi
 It is better to change your questions or else the situation will not change
 aapako pataa he ki elahabaad main upi lok seva ayog ke baahar chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 They demanded that the question papers of the second innings in the first innings of Hindi have been divided, so the examination should be canceled
 ayog ne pariksha radd bhi kar di magar sirf hindi kii
 Students started demanding that the entire exam be canceled, but the commission said that there was such a mess at the same center, so why cancel the rest of the exam
 is baat ko lekar chaatr ugr hue, police ne lathi charge kii, aath chaatro ko giraftaar kar liya
 Now seven of these students have been released so that they can appear for the examination on 21 June
 magar isamen shaamil samaajawaadee party kii netaa or elahabaad uniwarsity kii purv adhyaksh richa singh ko nahin choda gaya he
 He has been sent to jail
 tippaniyan The tenth result was to come on 20 June in Bihar
 17 lakh se adhik chaatr intazaar kar rahe the magar riselt ab 26 june ko aayega,kyonki aapako bataaya tha ki gopalganj zile main 42 hazaar uttar pustikaayen chori ho gai hai
 The same situation is with the farmers
 uttar pradesh ke amroha main kisaanon ne koi das hazaar bighas main tamaato ugaaya he
 In UP, most tomatoes are in Amroha itself, though mangoes are also very good
 yahaan ke kisaanon ne sadak ke kinare tomaamar phenk diya,kyonki bechney par bhi laagat nahin mil rahaa tha
 There is a crate of 30 kg
 kuch din pehle yahaan kii mandi main 80-90 rupee cret mil rahaa tha yani ek kilo ke 2 se 3 rupee mil rahe the, jabaki ek kilo tamaato ugane main 15 rupee kii laagat aati he
 We are also surprised by the change in the rate after this report from Amroha to Anwar Kamal
 haftaa bhar pehle 80 rupaya cret bhav tha, ab 280 se 290 rupee cret milane laga he
 That is, the price of Rs 8 to 9 kg is being available
 yah bhi kam he magar ek report ke baad 3 rupee se bhav 9 rupee kaise ho gaya he, ham bhi nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Farmers were saying that last year Pakistan got a lot of price due to export, so this time it took up more land on rent and did farming
 amroha zile main das hazaar bighas main tamaato kii kheti ho gai
 Many farmers are in debt due to loss
 amroha dilli se bahut dur nahin he
 There the farmer is not getting even 10 rupees for a kilo of tomatoes, but today the price of tomatoes was Rs 50 per kg at Katwaria Sarai in South Delhi
 safal main 44 rupaya kilo bhav he
 Now you tell me, in Amroha, the farmer is not getting 3 rupees per kg, while he is investing 15 rupees for growing one kilogram of tomatoes and 50 rupees tomatoes are being sold in Delhi
 aap bhi lut rahe hai or kisaan bhi lut rahaa he
 Then who is it that is carrying a profit of 47 rupees
 in sawaalon kaa thos samaadhaan koi pesh nahin kar rahaa he
 Politics has turned into gossip
 tay aapako karnaa he ki gapp hi sunanaa he yaa kaam bhi dekhnaa he
 Our leaders are constantly mocking the ambition of such youth
 ye ladki yahaan so rahi he, taaki subah jaag kar sawaalon ko hal karne kii sthiti main rahe
 You know that on 18 and 19 June, UP Police Recruitment Board conducted the examination for more than 40 thousand soldiers at 860 centers
 jiske liye 22 lakh ummidavaaron ne form bhare the
 During this time, such a crowd of youth came out from all around, which did not get any attention
 footpath or plateform par rashtriya paridhaan baniyaan pahane ye noujvaan stesan ke baahar so chuke hai
 This was the condition of the platform of Allahabad station as if a crowd of millions had reached on the occasion of Chhath or Holi
 prime time ke ek darshak ne vibhuti express ke asi coach kaa haal bheja he
 In B-1 coach, this young man is going to Patna sitting in a sack like a potato
 berojgaar naujavaanon kii garima kii kise paravhaan he
 You would say that this has been the case for many years
 kya yah agle kai saal tak yahi kehete rahenge yaa phir iskaa samaadhaan kabhi na kabhi khojenge
 When we asked the prime time viewer to send a video too, he sent it
 hamane ye tasviren isliye dikhain taaki aapako us bharat kaa andaaza ho jo rose ek adad naukari kii talash main footpaathon par so rahaa he
 So that our leaders will come and talk about this problem among you
 rajasthan patrika kii ek khabar dekh rahaa tha ki mahila va bal vikaas vibhaag main suparviser ke 180 padon ke liye kareeb chaar lakh aavedan aa chuke hai
 There are 2214 contenders for one seat
 itnaa taff compatishan he
 Job is not there
 haalat yah he ki saal bhar ke bheetar parikshaon ko karakar niyukti patr de dena chunauti ban gai he
 But also an excuse
 ab dekhie railway kii pariksha kab hogi kisi ko pataa nahin
 2
5 crore applications have come for one lakh posts
 philhal ek tasviir dekhie jise hamaare sahyogi amitesh ne lee he
 When a man becomes a human being, when he becomes a luggage, it depends on how much money he has in his pocket
 yahi jawan sipaahi banakar hamaari raksha karenge magar uske pehle ye kis amanviya prakriya se guzar rahe hai aap dekh sakate hai
 Ladday fadaye are going to the last compartment of the goods train
 mughalsarai kii taraf ja rahi is malgadee ke drishy ko yaad rakhiegaa
 It is good that the political consciousness of these youth is zero or our leaders would have trembled
 bharat ke yuva murda shanti se bhare noujvaan hai jinhen bas ek naukari kaa vigyaapan dikh janaa chahie
 Colleges that have been transformed into ruins are not visible, there are no inferior teachers within the college
 hamen or aapako bhi kuch nahin dikhataa he
 We had told about the results of BA bsc, b Com and Post Graduate of Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University
 vahaan fail hone waalon kii baraat nikali he
 The university installed cameras to prevent cheating during the exam this year
 nakal to ruuk gai magar fail hone vaale or imtahaan chhodane waalon kii sankhya bataa rahi he ki ye uniwarsity kisi kaam kii nahin he
 Students who study here and do not write names know where professors come, where they teach and where only names are written, exams are passed and no studies are done
 sirf avadh uniwarsity kii baat nahin he, hamane prime time main chhapra ke jepi uniwarsity or muzaffarpur ke dow
 Ambedkar had also told the condition of Bihar University
 hamane prime time main bataaya tha ki avadh uniwarsity main chah lakh ke kareeb chaatr pariksha main shaamil hue the or inamen se assi fisadi chaatr fail ho gaye
 That means around 4 lakh 80 thousand have failed
 uniwarsity ne 19 june ko ek press relies jari kar aankadon ko aise pesh kiya he ki sab kuch acha acha dikhe
 It is written in this release that a question mark is being put on the exam
 hamane yahaan kii padhai par prashn chinh lagaaya tha ki padhai kii kya quality he ki nakal rokane par fail hone vaale kii sankhya lakhon main pahunch jaati he
 Overall, the data is marketed
 sarkaar dwaara anudaan praapt collejon ke paas pratishat or khud se chalane vaale collejon ke paas pratishat main antar bataaya gaya he
 We had added that overall, in 2017-18, BA and b
sc, b
com three-year and post-graduate level six and a half million students took the exam
 80 pratishat fail ho gaye to is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya kareeb 4 lakh 80,000 ke kareeb chaatr fail hai
 Over 80 percent of BSC third year students fail
 biessi pratham varsh main 56 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 Ganapat Sahay Post Graduate College of Sultanpur had about 300 students in the final year in mathematics but only 20-25 of these have passed
 275 ke kareeb fail ho gaye hai
 On 19 June, the Vice Chancellor held a meeting and presented the data in such a way that four lakh children failed
 hamaara jor is par he ki padhai kii quality itani ghatiya kyon he ki chaatr nakal rokane ke naam par pariksha chhod dete hai yaa fail ho jate hai
 How long will we run away from this question until all the youth of India are destroyed
 19 june kii press relies main bie bikom birsi ke chaatro kii sankhya di gai he or unke paas pratishat die gaye hai, magar paas pratishat ko sarkari anudaan praapt or swany vitt poshit sansthaanon main baat diya gaya he taaki ye na lage ki sarkari sansthaanon main padhai kaa str kharaab he
 23,358 students joined the BSC second year and 20 percent were successful
 kya 80 fisadi chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? biessi tritiy varsh main 34,091 chaatr shaamil hue or 19
 18 percent of students were successful
 kya 80 pratishat se adhik chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? bie first year main 77,259 chaatr shaamil hue or 59
 95 percent passed
 kya 40 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? bie second year main 61,610 chaatr shaamil hue or 79
 86 percent passed
 kya 20 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? biessi pratham varsh main 40,442 chaatr shaamil hue or 43
 01 percent passed
 kya 57 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? This is the game
 fail hone vaale chaatro kaa pratishat sarkari or privet main baant diya gaya he
 If the result in private is so bad, then the university should tell what action it is going to take
 sarkari anudaan praapt collejon main paas pratishat bhale hi dekhne main 50 se 70 pratishat ke bich dikh rahaa he magar 20 se 40 pratishat chaatro kaa fail hona bhi uski clavity par sawaal he
 But one thing was not understood
 pariksha shuru hone se pehle 22 farvari ko vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati manoj dikshit ne press conference main kaha tha ki is baar snaatak str kii parikshaon main chah lakh 11 hazaar 680 chaatr shaamil honge
 But according to the calculation given in the press release of June 19, the number of students taking the exam is only 3 lakh 31 thousand 239
 hamen samaj nahin aayaa ki baaki ke 2 lakh 80 hazaar 441 chaatr kahaan gaye
 Has the calculation of courses like BBA and BCA been removed from it so that the total number of students who failed is reduced
 hamane uniwarsity series main dikhaaya tha ki avadh uniwarsity ke kai collejon main paryaapt sankhya main shikshak nahin hai
 Many colleges are only on paper, there is no education there
 yah sawaal maine apane liye nahin balki us garib ilaake ke saadhaaran pariwaron ke bacchon ke liye uthaaya tha ki aakhir unhen ghatiya quality kii shiksha kyon di ja rahi he
 Now the university has said that samples of 100 answer sheets will be sent to another university for examination so that it can be confirmed that there is no disturbance in the investigation
 iske liye fees nahin lagegi or chaatr chahen to is 100 copy main apni copy shaamil karaane kaa aavedan de sakate hai
 Isn't it strange? agar paanch sau chaatro ne aavedan kar diya to phir uniwarsity kya karegi
 Our question is another, how far is it appropriate to take Rs 3000 from students of a poor area to check the answer book
 yah vyavastha 6 maah pehle lagu hui yaa ab lagu hui isse matlab nahin he sawaal he ki 3000 rupee jaanch ke kyon liye jaaenge
 Mistake of university and money of student
 yahaan system yah he ki 300 rupee pehle dijie phir uttar pustika kii photo copy hasil kiijie
 If it seems that something is wrong then give 3 000 thousand so that the investigation can be done
 kya hoshiyaari he paisa kamaane kii
 Not only Avadh University, this is happening in many other universities
 chaatr sawaal uthaate hai magar koi sunne vaala nahin he
 Not only Avadh University, you should look at the Hindi newspapers of the first week of June
 patrika, amar ujaalaa, jaagran, hindustan
 Only 20 percent students have passed in Bundelkhand University
 biessi pratham varsh main 88 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 The result of private colleges has been the worst
 sochie privet collejon kaa ye haal he
 Here, again, 3000 rupees have to be paid for a copy check
 nakal roak di gai acchhee baat he magar jo asaliyat saamne ai he wo usase bhi buree bhi baat he
 Why are the results of these colleges so bad? kanpur ke chhatrapati shahu ji maharaj vishvavidhyalay ke nattejey bhi bataa rahe hai ki nakal par roak ke saath saath padhai kii quality par dhyaan dene kii zarurat he
 This video is a few days old
 chaatr fail hone par naaraaz hai or uttar pustika kii dobaaraa jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 Registrar Sanjay Kumar told that 93 thousand students appeared in the examination in the first year of b
sc
 inamen se 49
 Only 9 children have passed
 38
 24 percent have failed and close to 11 percent have not appeared for the exam
 biessi part tu main 94620 main sirf 33 pratishat chaatr hi paas ho sake
 Close to 58 percent have failed
 biessi third year main 98 hazaar ke kareeb chaatr pariksha main baithe jisamen 57 percent hi paas hue
 39 percent failed
 kanpur dehaat ke ek college main 130 chaatro main se ek paas hua he
 This is the condition of studies
 chaatro kii maang par cameti bhi bani ki kahin moolyankan main gadabadi to nahin hui magar cameti ne uniwarsity ko clin chit diya he
 a total of 1 lakh 28 thousand students have failed in the three years of b
sc of Kanpur University
 kya yah gambhir masalaa nahin he? ab aap sochie ki kya padhai ho rahi he ki itane chaatr fail ho rahe hai
 What will these contribute to India's productivity or economy
 bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon main pachaas hazaar se ek lakh ke bich lekturer professor ke pad khaali hai
 The administration of the university is happy that it is not allowed to be copied, but is it not a cry that college students failed in college
 unhen kya padhaayaa gaya kya isaki javabdehi kisi kii nahin he
 Why our colleges are so poor that students are not able to pass
 yah sawaal vahaan vetan paa rahe professor lekturer or chaatro teenon se he
 Do students understand what they are doing with themselves? baat sirf kanpur or avadh uniwarsity kii nahin
 On June 4, a news of Pankaj Dabhol appeared in the Times of India
 94 fisadi iti graduate naukari dene ke laayak nahin hai
 This statement is from the CEO of Tech Mahindra
 iti companiyon ko ab apana training centre kholana padaa he
 Top IT companies employ only 6 percent of IT engineers
 ham yah baat kai saal se sun rahe hai ki hamaare ejeeniyar kisi laayak nahin hai
 Common families are paying twenty-two million fees in private colleges by paying loans and after passing it is heard that 94% of IT engineers are not fit to be hired, then with whom is this cheating? kya yah dakaiti nahin he
 Are parents and students not cheated? kya yah sharmnaak nahin he ki bharat kii ejineering kii shiksha itani ghatiya he ki iske collejon se paas 94 fisadi ejeeniyar naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai
 Are the youth not being deceived? kya usne muft main padhai kii thi
 It is better to change your questions or else the situation will not change
 aapako pataa he ki elahabaad main upi lok seva ayog ke baahar chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 They demanded that the question papers of the second innings in the first innings of Hindi have been divided, so the examination should be canceled
 ayog ne pariksha radd bhi kar di magar sirf hindi kii
 Students started demanding that the entire exam be canceled, but the commission said that there was such a mess at the same center, so why cancel the rest of the exam
 is baat ko lekar chaatr ugr hue, police ne lathi charge kii, aath chaatro ko giraftaar kar liya
 Now seven of these students have been released so that they can appear for the examination on 21 June
 magar isamen shaamil samaajawaadee party kii netaa or elahabaad uniwarsity kii purv adhyaksh richa singh ko nahin choda gaya he
 He has been sent to jail
 tippaniyan The tenth result was to come on 20 June in Bihar
 17 lakh se adhik chaatr intazaar kar rahe the magar riselt ab 26 june ko aayega,kyonki aapako bataaya tha ki gopalganj zile main 42 hazaar uttar pustikaayen chori ho gai hai
 The same situation is with the farmers
 uttar pradesh ke amroha main kisaanon ne koi das hazaar bighas main tamaato ugaaya he
 In UP, most tomatoes are in Amroha itself, though mangoes are also very good
 yahaan ke kisaanon ne sadak ke kinare tomaamar phenk diya,kyonki bechney par bhi laagat nahin mil rahaa tha
 There is a crate of 30 kg
 kuch din pehle yahaan kii mandi main 80-90 rupee cret mil rahaa tha yani ek kilo ke 2 se 3 rupee mil rahe the, jabaki ek kilo tamaato ugane main 15 rupee kii laagat aati he
 We are also surprised by the change in the rate after this report from Amroha to Anwar Kamal
 haftaa bhar pehle 80 rupaya cret bhav tha, ab 280 se 290 rupee cret milane laga he
 That is, the price of Rs 8 to 9 kg is being available
 yah bhi kam he magar ek report ke baad 3 rupee se bhav 9 rupee kaise ho gaya he, ham bhi nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Farmers were saying that last year Pakistan got a lot of price due to export, so this time it took up more land on rent and did farming
 amroha zile main das hazaar bighas main tamaato kii kheti ho gai
 Many farmers are in debt due to loss
 amroha dilli se bahut dur nahin he
 There the farmer is not getting even 10 rupees for a kilo of tomatoes, but today the price of tomatoes was Rs 50 per kg at Katwaria Sarai in South Delhi
 safal main 44 rupaya kilo bhav he
 Now you tell me, in Amroha, the farmer is not getting 3 rupees per kg, while he is investing 15 rupees for growing one kilogram of tomatoes and 50 rupees tomatoes are being sold in Delhi
 aap bhi lut rahe hai or kisaan bhi lut rahaa he
 Then who is it that is carrying a profit of 47 rupees
 in sawaalon kaa thos samaadhaan koi pesh nahin kar rahaa he
 Politics has turned into gossip
 tay aapako karnaa he ki gapp hi sunanaa he yaa kaam bhi dekhnaa he
 a prime time viewer has sent the condition of AC coach of Vibhuti Express
 bi-1 coach main ye noujvaan bore main aalu kii tarah thunsa kar baithe patna ja rahe hai
 Who is proud of the dignity of unemployed youth
 aap kahenge ki ye to kai saal se yahi hota he
 Will he keep saying this for the next several years or will he find a solution at some point or the other
 jab hamane prime time ke darshak se kaha ki ek video bhi bhejie to unhone ye bheja he
 We showed these pictures so that you can get an idea of the India which is sleeping on the pavements in search of a unique job every day
 taaki hamaare netaa is samasya ke bare main aapke bich aakar bolen
 a news report from Rajasthan Patrika was seeing that about four lakh applications have been received for the 180 posts of Supervisor in the Department of Women and Child Development
 ek seat par 2214 daavedaar hai
 There is so much competition
 naukari he nahin
 The situation is that within the year, it has become a challenge to get the examinations and give appointment letters
 balki bahaanaa bhi
 Now, no one knows when the railway examination will take place
 dhai karod aavedan ek lakh padon ke liye aae hai
 Look at a picture taken by our colleague Amitesh
 aadmi kab insaan ho jaataa he, kab saamaan ho jaataa he, yah is par nirbhar karata he ki uski jeb main kitne rupee hai
 These young soldiers will protect us as soldiers, but before that they can see what inhuman process they are going through
 malgadee ke pichley dibbe par ladaaye fadaaye chale ja rahe hai
 Remember the scene of this freight train going towards Mughalsarai
 acchhee baat he ki in naujavaanon kii raajnneetik chetana shunya he varanaa hamaare netaaon ko tharthari ho jaati
 The young corpses of India are peace-filled youth who should be seen just advertising a job
 khandhar main badal chuke college nahin dikhte hai, college ke bheetar ghatiya teacher nahin dikhte hai
 We see nothing from you
 hamane ram manohar lohia avadh uniwarsity ke bie biessi, bi com or post graduate ke riselt ke bare main bataaya tha
 There is a procession of those who failed there
 vishvavidhyalay ne is saal pariksha ke dauraan nakal rokane ke liye camere laga die
 The copying has stopped, but the number of people who fail and leave the examination is telling that this university is of no use
 yahaan padhane vaale or naam likhaa kar nahin padhane vaale chaatro ko pataa he ki kahaan professor aate hai, kahaan padhaate hai or kahaan sirf naam likhaaya jaataa he, pariksha paas karaayaa jaataa he or padhai nahin hoti he
 It is not just about Avadh University, we have Jaypee University of Chapra and Dr
 of Muzaffarpur in prime time
 ambedkar bihar uniwarsity kaa bhi haal bataaya tha
 We had told in prime time that around six lakh students appeared in the examination at Awadh University and eighty percent of them failed
 yani 4 lakh 80 hazaar ke kareeb fail ho gaye
 The university released a press release on June 19, presenting the data in such a way that everything looks good
 is relies main likhaa he ki pariksha par prashn chinh lagaaya ja rahaa he
 We had put a question mark on the education here, what is the quality of studies that the number of people who fail to reach copying reaches millions
 kul milakar aankadon kii bazigaari kii gai he
 The difference between the percentage of government-funded colleges and the percentage of self-run colleges has been reported
 hamane overol jodakar bataaya tha ki 2017-18 main bie biessi, bi com ke teenon saal ke or post graduate str ke sava chah lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi
 If 80 percent failed, then about 4 lakh 80,000 students failed due to this
 biessi third year ke 80 pratishat se adhik chaatr fail hai
 In BSC first year, 56 percent students have failed
 sultanpur ke ganpat sahay post graduate mahavidhyalay ke ganit main final year main kareeb 300 chaatr the lekin inamen se maatr 20-25 chaatr paas hue hai
 Nearly 275 have failed
 19 june ko vaais chancelar ne ek meeting kar aankadon ko is tarah pesh kiya he jisase na lage ki chaar lakh bachche fail ho gaye
 Our emphasis is on why the quality of studies is so poor that students leave or fail in the name of stopping copying
 ham kab tak bhaagenge is sawaal se kya tab tak jab tak bharat ke saare noujvaan barbaad nahin kar die jate
 The June 19 press release lists the number of BA bcom BAC students and their percentages, but the pass percentage has been distributed among government-funded and self-funded institutions so that it does not look as if studying in government institutions Level is poor
 biessi dwitiya varsh main 23,358 chaatr shaamil hue or 20 pratishat safal hue
 Is it not shameful that 80 percent of the students fail? In BSC III year, 34,091 students attended and 19
 18 pratishat chaatr safal hue
 Is it not shameful that more than 80 percent of the students fail? 77,259 students attended and 59 in BA First Year
 95 pratishat paas hue
 Is it not shameful that 40 percent of the students fail? 61,610 students attended the BA Second Year and 79
 86 pratishat paas hue
 Isn't it embarrassing for 20 percent of the students to fail? 40,442 students attended and 43 in bsc first year
 01 pratishat paas hue
 Isn't it embarrassing for 57 percent of the students to fail? yahi khel he
 The percentage of students who failed is divided into government and private
 agar privet main rigelt itnaa kharaab he to vishvavidhyalay yah bataae ki vah kya ection lene ja rahaa he
 The pass percentage in government-funded colleges may be between 50 and 70 percent in sight, but the failure of 20 to 40 percent students is also a question on its quality
 par ek baat samaj nahin ai
 On February 22, before the examination started, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Manoj Dixit, said in a press conference that this time six lakh 11 thousand 680 students will be included in the graduation examinations
 magar 19 june kii press release main jo hisaab diya he uske anusaar to pariksha dene vaale chaatro kii sankhya 3 lakh 31 hazaar 239 hi he
 We did not understand where the remaining 2 lakh 80 thousand 441 students went
 kya bibie or bisie jaise course kaa hisaab isamen se hataa diya gaya he taaki fail hone vaale chaatro kii total sankhya kam lage
 We had shown in the University Series that many colleges in Awadh University do not have sufficient number of teachers
 kai collejon main sirf kaagaj par hi hai vahaan padhai nahin hoti
 i raised this question not for myself but for the children of ordinary families of that poor area, why are they being given poor quality education
 ab uniwarsity ne kaha he ki 100 uttar pustikaon ke sample duusari uniwarsity main jaanch ke liye bheje jaaenge taaki isaki pushti ho sake ki jaanch main gadabadi to nahin hui he
 There will be no fee for this and students can apply to include their copy in this 100 copy if they wish
 kya yah ajeeb nahi he
 If five hundred students apply then what will the university do
 hamaara sawaal ek or he ek garib ilaake ke chaatro se uttar pustika kii jaanch ke liye 3000 rupee lenaa kahaan tak uchit he
 This system came into force 6 months ago or is implemented now
 It does not mean that the question of why 3000 rupees will be taken for investigation
 galati uniwarsity kii or paisa chaatr kaa
 The system here is to give Rs 300 first and then get a photo copy of the answer book
 usamen lagata he ki gadabadi hui he to phir 3000 hazaar dijie taaki jaanch ho
 What is the intelligence to earn money
 avadh uniwarsity hi nahin duusari kai uniwarsity main yah sab hone laga he
 Students raise questions but no one is listening
 avadh uniwarsity hi nahin aap june ke pehle saptaah ke hindi ke akhabaaron ko dekhie
 Magazine, Amar Ujala, Jagran, Hindustan
 bundelkhand vishvavidhyalay main 20 pratishat chaatr hi paas hue hai
 In BSC first year 88 percent students have failed
 privet collejon kaa riselt sabase kharaab rahaa he
 Think this is the condition of private colleges
 yahaan bhi dobaaraa copy check karaane ke liye 3000 rupee dene padate hai
 Copying has been stopped is a good thing, but the reality that has come out is worse than that
 in collejon kaa rigelt itnaa kharaab kyon hai
 The results of Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University of Kanpur are also showing that apart from stopping the copying, there is a need to pay attention to the quality of studies
 yah video kuch din purana he
 The students are angry at the failure and are demanding a re-examination of the answer sheet
 register sanjay kumaar ne bataaya biessi pratham varsh main 93 hazaar chaatr pariksha main shaamil hue the
 49 of these
 9 bachche hi paas hue hai
 38
 24 pratishat fail hue hai or 11 pratishat ke kareeb pariksha main baithe hi nahin
 In BSC Part Two, only 33 percent of the students could pass in 94620
 58 pratishat ke kareeb fail hue hai
 In BSC Third Year, close to 98 thousand students appeared in the examination, in which only 57% passed
 39 percent fail ho gaye
 One in 130 students passed out in a college in Kanpur Dehat
 ye haal he padhai kaa
 a committee was also formed on the demand of students that there was no disturbance in the assessment, but the committee has given a clean chit to the university
 kanpur uniwarsity ke biessi ke teenon saal main kul 1 lakh 28 hazaar chaatr fail hue hai
 Isn't this a serious issue? Now think what is going on in studies that so many students are failing
 ye bharat kii utpaadakta yaa arthvyavastha main kya yogadan karenge
 Between fifty thousand and one lakh lecturers professor positions are vacant in universities in India
 uniwarsity kaa prashasan khush he ki nakal nahin hone di lekin kya yah rone vaali baat nahin he ki college ke college chaatr fail ho gaye
 No one is accountable for what they have been taught
 kyon hamaare collejon kii padhai itani kharaab he ki chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 This question is from the three lecturers and students who are getting salaries
 kya chaatr samaj rahe hai ki ve apane saath kya kar rahe hai
 It is not just about Kanpur and Awadh University
 isi 4 june ko times of india main pankaj dabhol kii ek khabar chhapi he
 94 percent of IT graduates are not eligible for employment

 We have been hearing for many years that our engineers are not fit
 aam parivaar karz lekar bees-bees lakh fees dekar privet collejon main padhaa rahe hai or paas hone ke baad yah sunne ko mili ki 94 fisadi iti ejeeniyar naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai to yah kiske saath dhokhaa he
 Isn't it a robbery? kya maa baap or chaatr ke saath dhokhaa nahin hai
 Isn't it shameful that India's engineering education is so inferior that 94 per cent of engineers from its colleges are not fit to be hired? kya naujavaanon ke saath dhokhaa nahin ho rahaa he
 Did she study for free? behatar he apane sawaal badal len varanaa halaat nahin badalenge
 You know that students demonstrated outside the UP Public Service Commission in Allahabad
 inaki maang thi ki hindi kii pehali pari main duusari pari ke prashn patr bant gaye hai, isliye pariksha radd ho
 The Commission also canceled the examination but did only Hindi
 chaatr maang karne lage ki sari pariksha radd ho magar ayog kaa kahana tha ki ek hi centre par aisi gadabadi hui he, isliye baaki pariksha kyon radd karen
 Students were agitated about this, police charged lathi, arrested eight students
 ab inamen se saat chaatro ko chhod diya gaya he taaki ve 21 june kii pariksha main shaamil ho saken
 But the Samajwadi Party leader and former Allahabad University president Richa Singh has not been left out
 unhen jail bhej diya gaya he
 The comments bihar main 20 june ko dasvin kaa riselt aana tha
 More than 17 lakh students were waiting, but the result will now come on 26 June, because you were told that 42 thousand answer sheets have been stolen in Gopalganj district
 yahi haal kisaanon kaa he
 In Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, farmers have grown tomatoes in ten thousand bighas
 upi main sabase adhik tamaato amroha main hi hota he vaise aam bhi khub hota he
 The farmers here threw the tamaras on the side of the road, because the cost was not available even if they were sold
 30 kilo kaa ek cret hota he
 a few days ago, there was a crate of 80-90 rupees in the mandi here, that is, 2 to 3 rupees per kg, while it costs Rs 15 to grow one kg of tomatoes
 amroha se anwar kamaal kii is report ke baad jo rate main badlaav aayaa he usase ham bhi hairaan he
 a week ago, there was a crate price of 80 rupees, now 280 to 290 crates are available
 yani 8 rupee se 9 rupee kilo ke bhav mil rahe hai
 This is also less, but after a report, how the price has gone from 3 rupees to 9 rupees, we are unable to understand
 kisaan kah rahe the ki pichley saal pakistan niryaat ke kaaran khub bhav mila to is baar zyaada zamin kiraaye par lekar kheti kar lee
 In Amroha district, tomato cultivated in ten thousand bighas
 kai kisaan nuksaan ke kaaran karze main aa gaye hai
 Amroha is not far from Delhi
 vahaan kisaan ko ek kilo tamaato ke 10 rupee bhi nahin mil rahe hai lekin aaj hi dakshin dilli ke katwaria sarai main tamaato kaa bhav 50 rupee kilo tha
 There is a price of 44 rupees kg in the successful
 ab aap hi bataaiye amroha main kisaan ko 3 rupee kilo bhav nahin mil rahe hai, jabaki vah ek kilo tomaamar ugane main 15 rupee laga de rahaa he or dilli main 50 rupee kilo tamaato bik rahaa he
 You are also being plundered and the farmer is also being plundered
 phir yah koun he jo 47 rupee kaa munafa le ja rahaa he
 No one is offering concrete solutions to these questions
 raajnneeti gappabaazi main badal gai he
 You have to decide whether to listen to the chat or see the work
 hamane ye tasviren isliye dikhain taaki aapako us bharat kaa andaaza ho jo rose ek adad naukari kii talash main footpaathon par so rahaa he
 So that our leaders will come and talk about this problem among you

 There are 2214 contenders for one seat
 itnaa taff compatishan he
 Job is not there
 haalat yah he ki saal bhar ke bheetar parikshaon ko karakar niyukti patr de dena chunauti ban gai he
 But also an excuse
 ab dekhie railway kii pariksha kab hogi kisi ko pataa nahin

5 crore applications have come for one lakh posts

 When a man becomes a human being, when he becomes a luggage, it depends on how much money he has in his pocket
 yahi jawan sipaahi banakar hamaari raksha karenge magar uske pehle ye kis amanviya prakriya se guzar rahe hai aap dekh sakate hai
 Ladday fadaye are going to the last compartment of the goods train
 mughalsarai kii taraf ja rahi is malgadee ke drishy ko yaad rakhiegaa
 It is good that the political consciousness of these youth is zero or our leaders would have trembled
 bharat ke yuva murda shanti se bhare noujvaan hai jinhen bas ek naukari kaa vigyaapan dikh janaa chahie
 Colleges that have been transformed into ruins are not visible, there are no inferior teachers within the college

 The university installed cameras to prevent cheating during the exam this year
 nakal to ruuk gai magar fail hone vaale or imtahaan chhodane waalon kii sankhya bataa rahi he ki ye uniwarsity kisi kaam kii nahin he
 Students who study here and do not write names know where professors come, where they teach and where only names are written, exams are passed and no studies are done
 sirf avadh uniwarsity kii baat nahin he, hamane prime time main chhapra ke jepi uniwarsity or muzaffarpur ke dow
 Ambedkar had also told the condition of Bihar University
 hamane prime time main bataaya tha ki avadh uniwarsity main chah lakh ke kareeb chaatr pariksha main shaamil hue the or inamen se assi fisadi chaatr fail ho gaye
 That means around 4 lakh 80 thousand have failed
 uniwarsity ne 19 june ko ek press relies jari kar aankadon ko aise pesh kiya he ki sab kuch acha acha dikhe
 It is written in this release that a question mark is being put on the exam
 hamane yahaan kii padhai par prashn chinh lagaaya tha ki padhai kii kya quality he ki nakal rokane par fail hone vaale kii sankhya lakhon main pahunch jaati he
 Overall, the data is marketed
 sarkaar dwaara anudaan praapt collejon ke paas pratishat or khud se chalane vaale collejon ke paas pratishat main antar bataaya gaya he
 We had added that overall, in 2017-18, BA and b
sc, b
com three-year and post-graduate level six and a half million students took the exam
 80 pratishat fail ho gaye to is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya kareeb 4 lakh 80,000 ke kareeb chaatr fail hai
 Over 80 percent of BSC third year students fail
 biessi pratham varsh main 56 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 Ganapat Sahay Post Graduate College of Sultanpur had about 300 students in the final year in mathematics but only 20-25 of these have passed
 275 ke kareeb fail ho gaye hai
 On 19 June, the Vice Chancellor held a meeting and presented the data in such a way that four lakh children failed
 hamaara jor is par he ki padhai kii quality itani ghatiya kyon he ki chaatr nakal rokane ke naam par pariksha chhod dete hai yaa fail ho jate hai
 How long will we run away from this question until all the youth of India are destroyed
 19 june kii press relies main bie bikom birsi ke chaatro kii sankhya di gai he or unke paas pratishat die gaye hai, magar paas pratishat ko sarkari anudaan praapt or swany vitt poshit sansthaanon main baat diya gaya he taaki ye na lage ki sarkari sansthaanon main padhai kaa str kharaab he
 23,358 students joined the BSC second year and 20 percent were successful
 kya 80 fisadi chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? biessi tritiy varsh main 34,091 chaatr shaamil hue or 19
 18 percent of students were successful
 kya 80 pratishat se adhik chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? bie first year main 77,259 chaatr shaamil hue or 59

 01 percent passed
 kya 57 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? This is the game
 fail hone vaale chaatro kaa pratishat sarkari or privet main baant diya gaya he
 If the result in private is so bad, then the university should tell what action it is going to take
 sarkari anudaan praapt collejon main paas pratishat bhale hi dekhne main 50 se 70 pratishat ke bich dikh rahaa he magar 20 se 40 pratishat chaatro kaa fail hona bhi uski clavity par sawaal he
 But one thing was not understood
 pariksha shuru hone se pehle 22 farvari ko vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati manoj dikshit ne press conference main kaha tha ki is baar snaatak str kii parikshaon main chah lakh 11 hazaar 680 chaatr shaamil honge
 But according to the calculation given in the press release of June 19, the number of students taking the exam is only 3 lakh 31 thousand 239
 hamen samaj nahin aayaa ki baaki ke 2 lakh 80 hazaar 441 chaatr kahaan gaye
 Has the calculation of courses like BBA and BCA been removed from it so that the total number of students who failed is reduced
 hamane uniwarsity series main dikhaaya tha ki avadh uniwarsity ke kai collejon main paryaapt sankhya main shikshak nahin hai
 Many colleges are only on paper, there is no education there
 yah sawaal maine apane liye nahin balki us garib ilaake ke saadhaaran pariwaron ke bacchon ke liye uthaaya tha ki aakhir unhen ghatiya quality kii shiksha kyon di ja rahi he
 Now the university has said that samples of 100 answer sheets will be sent to another university for examination so that it can be confirmed that there is no disturbance in the investigation
 iske liye fees nahin lagegi or chaatr chahen to is 100 copy main apni copy shaamil karaane kaa aavedan de sakate hai
 Isn't it strange? agar paanch sau chaatro ne aavedan kar diya to phir uniwarsity kya karegi
 Our question is another, how far is it appropriate to take Rs 3000 from students of a poor area to check the answer book
 yah vyavastha 6 maah pehle lagu hui yaa ab lagu hui isse matlab nahin he sawaal he ki 3000 rupee jaanch ke kyon liye jaaenge
 Mistake of university and money of student
 yahaan system yah he ki 300 rupee pehle dijie phir uttar pustika kii photo copy hasil kiijie
 If it seems that there is a disturbance then give 3000 thousand so that the investigation can be done
 kya hoshiyaari he paisa kamaane kii
 Not only Avadh University, this is happening in many other universities
 chaatr sawaal uthaate hai magar koi sunne vaala nahin he
 Not only Avadh University, you should look at the Hindi newspapers of the first week of June
 patrika, amar ujaalaa, jaagran, hindustan
 Only 20 percent students have passed in Bundelkhand University
 biessi pratham varsh main 88 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 The result of private colleges has been the worst
 sochie privet collejon kaa ye haal he
 Here, again, 3000 rupees have to be paid for a copy check
 nakal roak di gai acchhee baat he magar jo asaliyat saamne ai he wo usase bhi buree bhi baat he
 Why are the results of these colleges so bad? kanpur ke chhatrapati shahu ji maharaj vishvavidhyalay ke nattejey bhi bataa rahe hai ki nakal par roak ke saath saath padhai kii quality par dhyaan dene kii zarurat he
 This video is a few days old

 a total of 1 lakh 28 thousand students have failed in the three years of b

 kya yah gambhir masalaa nahin he? ab aap sochie ki kya padhai ho rahi he ki itane chaatr fail ho rahe hai
 What will these contribute to India's productivity or economy
 bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon main pachaas hazaar se ek lakh ke bich lekturer professor ke pad khaali hai
 The administration of the university is happy that it is not allowed to be copied, but is it not a cry that college students failed in college
 unhen kya padhaayaa gaya kya isaki javabdehi kisi kii nahin he
 Why our colleges are so poor that students are not able to pass
 yah sawaal vahaan vetan paa rahe professor lekturer or chaatro teenon se he
 Do students understand what they are doing with themselves? baat sirf kanpur or avadh uniwarsity kii nahin
 On June 4, a news of Pankaj Dabhol appeared in the Times of India

 Are the youth not being deceived? kya usne muft main padhai kii thi
 It is better to change your questions or else the situation will not change
 aapako pataa he ki elahabaad main upi lok seva ayog ke baahar chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 They demanded that the question papers of the second innings in the first innings of Hindi have been divided, so the examination should be canceled
 ayog ne pariksha radd bhi kar di magar sirf hindi kii
 Students started demanding that the entire exam be canceled, but the commission said that there was such a mess at the same center, so why cancel the rest of the exam
 is baat ko lekar chaatr ugr hue, police ne lathi charge kii, aath chaatro ko giraftaar kar liya
 Now seven of these students have been released so that they can appear for the examination on 21 June

 The same situation is with the farmers
 uttar pradesh ke amroha main kisaanon ne koi das hazaar bighas main tamaato ugaaya he
 In UP, most tomatoes are in Amroha itself, though mangoes are also very good
 yahaan ke kisaanon ne sadak ke kinare tomaamar phenk diya,kyonki bechney par bhi laagat nahin mil rahaa tha
 There is a crate of 30 kg
 kuch din pehle yahaan kii mandi main 80-90 rupee cret mil rahaa tha yani ek kilo ke 2 se 3 rupee mil rahe the, jabaki ek kilo tamaato ugane main 15 rupee kii laagat aati he
 We are also surprised by the change in the rate after this report from Amroha to Anwar Kamal
 haftaa bhar pehle 80 rupaya cret bhav tha, ab 280 se 290 rupee cret milane laga he
 That is, the price of Rs 8 to 9 kg is being available
 yah bhi kam he magar ek report ke baad 3 rupee se bhav 9 rupee kaise ho gaya he, ham bhi nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Farmers were saying that last year Pakistan got a lot of price due to export, so this time it took up more land on rent and did farming
 amroha zile main das hazaar bighas main tamaato kii kheti ho gai
 Many farmers are in debt due to loss
 amroha dilli se bahut dur nahin he
 There the farmer is not getting even 10 rupees for a kilo of tomatoes, but today the price of tomatoes was Rs 50 per kg at Katwaria Sarai in South Delhi
 safal main 44 rupaya kilo bhav he
 Now you tell me, in Amroha, the farmer is not getting 3 rupees per kg, while he is investing 15 rupees for growing one kilogram of tomatoes and 50 rupees tomatoes are being sold in Delhi
 aap bhi lut rahe hai or kisaan bhi lut rahaa he
 Then who is it that is carrying a profit of 47 rupees

 uniwarsity ne 19 june ko ek press relies jari kar aankadon ko aise pesh kiya he ki sab kuch acha acha dikhe
 It is written in this release that a question mark is being put on the exam
 hamane yahaan kii padhai par prashn chinh lagaaya tha ki padhai kii kya quality he ki nakal rokane par fail hone vaale kii sankhya lakhon main pahunch jaati he
 Overall, the data is marketed
 sarkaar dwaara anudaan praapt collejon ke paas pratishat or khud se chalane vaale collejon ke paas pratishat main antar bataaya gaya he
 We had added that overall, in 2017-18, BA and b
sc, b
com three-year and post-graduate level six and a half million students took the exam
 80 pratishat fail ho gaye to is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya kareeb 4 lakh 80,000 ke kareeb chaatr fail hai
 Over 80 percent of BSC third year students fail
 biessi pratham varsh main 56 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 Ganapat Sahay Post Graduate College of Sultanpur had about 300 students in the final year in mathematics but only 20-25 of these have passed
 275 ke kareeb fail ho gaye hai
 On 19 June, the Vice Chancellor held a meeting and presented the data in such a way that four lakh children failed
 hamaara jor is par he ki padhai kii quality itani ghatiya kyon he ki chaatr nakal rokane ke naam par pariksha chhod dete hai yaa fail ho jate hai
 How long will we run away from this question until all the youth of India are destroyed
 19 june kii press relies main bie bikom birsi ke chaatro kii sankhya di gai he or unke paas pratishat die gaye hai, magar paas pratishat ko sarkari anudaan praapt or swany vitt poshit sansthaanon main baat diya gaya he taaki ye na lage ki sarkari sansthaanon main padhai kaa str kharaab he
 23,358 students joined the BSC second year and 20 percent were successful
 kya 80 fisadi chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? biessi tritiy varsh main 34,091 chaatr shaamil hue or 19
 18 percent of students were successful
 kya 80 pratishat se adhik chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? bie first year main 77,259 chaatr shaamil hue or 59
 95 percent passed
 kya 40 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? bie second year main 61,610 chaatr shaamil hue or 79
 86 percent passed
 kya 20 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? biessi pratham varsh main 40,442 chaatr shaamil hue or 43
 01 percent passed
 kya 57 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? This is the game
 fail hone vaale chaatro kaa pratishat sarkari or privet main baant diya gaya he
 If the result in private is so bad, then the university should tell what action it is going to take
 sarkari anudaan praapt collejon main paas pratishat bhale hi dekhne main 50 se 70 pratishat ke bich dikh rahaa he magar 20 se 40 pratishat chaatro kaa fail hona bhi uski clavity par sawaal he
 But one thing was not understood
 pariksha shuru hone se pehle 22 farvari ko vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati manoj dikshit ne press conference main kaha tha ki is baar snaatak str kii parikshaon main chah lakh 11 hazaar 680 chaatr shaamil honge
 But according to the calculation given in the press release of June 19, the number of students taking the exam is only 3 lakh 31 thousand 239
 hamen samaj nahin aayaa ki baaki ke 2 lakh 80 hazaar 441 chaatr kahaan gaye
 Has the calculation of courses like BBA and BCA been removed from it so that the total number of students who failed is reduced
 hamane uniwarsity series main dikhaaya tha ki avadh uniwarsity ke kai collejon main paryaapt sankhya main shikshak nahin hai
 Many colleges are only on paper, there is no education there
 yah sawaal maine apane liye nahin balki us garib ilaake ke saadhaaran pariwaron ke bacchon ke liye uthaaya tha ki aakhir unhen ghatiya quality kii shiksha kyon di ja rahi he
 Now the university has said that samples of 100 answer sheets will be sent to another university for examination so that it can be confirmed that there is no disturbance in the investigation
 iske liye fees nahin lagegi or chaatr chahen to is 100 copy main apni copy shaamil karaane kaa aavedan de sakate hai
 Isn't it strange? agar paanch sau chaatro ne aavedan kar diya to phir uniwarsity kya karegi
 Our question is another, how far is it appropriate to take Rs 3000 from students of a poor area to check the answer book
 yah vyavastha 6 maah pehle lagu hui yaa ab lagu hui isse matlab nahin he sawaal he ki 3000 rupee jaanch ke kyon liye jaaenge
 Mistake of university and money of student
 yahaan system yah he ki 300 rupee pehle dijie phir uttar pustika kii photo copy hasil kiijie
 If it seems that there is a disturbance then give 3000 thousand so that the investigation can be done
 kya hoshiyaari he paisa kamaane kii
 Not only Avadh University, this is happening in many other universities
 chaatr sawaal uthaate hai magar koi sunne vaala nahin he
 Not only Avadh University, you should look at the Hindi newspapers of the first week of June
 patrika, amar ujaalaa, jaagran, hindustan
 Only 20 percent students have passed in Bundelkhand University
 biessi pratham varsh main 88 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 The result of private colleges has been the worst
 sochie privet collejon kaa ye haal he
 Here, again, 3000 rupees have to be paid for a copy check
 nakal roak di gai acchhee baat he magar jo asaliyat saamne ai he wo usase bhi buree bhi baat he
 Why are the results of these colleges so bad? kanpur ke chhatrapati shahu ji maharaj vishvavidhyalay ke nattejey bhi bataa rahe hai ki nakal par roak ke saath saath padhai kii quality par dhyaan dene kii zarurat he
 This video is a few days old
 chaatr fail hone par naaraaz hai or uttar pustika kii dobaaraa jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 Registrar Sanjay Kumar told that 93 thousand students appeared in the examination in the first year of b
sc
 inamen se 49
 Only 9 children have passed
 38
 24 percent have failed and close to 11 percent have not appeared for the exam
 biessi part tu main 94620 main sirf 33 pratishat chaatr hi paas ho sake
 Close to 58 percent have failed
 biessi third year main 98 hazaar ke kareeb chaatr pariksha main baithe jisamen 57 percent hi paas hue
 39 percent failed
 kanpur dehaat ke ek college main 130 chaatro main se ek paas hua he
 This is the condition of studies
 chaatro kii maang par cameti bhi bani ki kahin moolyankan main gadabadi to nahin hui magar cameti ne uniwarsity ko clin chit diya he
 a total of 1 lakh 28 thousand students have failed in the three years of b
sc of Kanpur University
 kya yah gambhir masalaa nahin he? ab aap sochie ki kya padhai ho rahi he ki itane chaatr fail ho rahe hai
 What will these contribute to India's productivity or economy
 bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon main pachaas hazaar se ek lakh ke bich lekturer professor ke pad khaali hai
 The administration of the university is happy that it is not allowed to be copied, but is it not a cry that college students failed in college
 unhen kya padhaayaa gaya kya isaki javabdehi kisi kii nahin he
 Why our colleges are so poor that students are not able to pass
 yah sawaal vahaan vetan paa rahe professor lekturer or chaatro teenon se he
 Do students understand what they are doing with themselves? baat sirf kanpur or avadh uniwarsity kii nahin
 On June 4, a news of Pankaj Dabhol appeared in the Times of India
 94 fisadi iti graduate naukari dene ke laayak nahin hai
 This statement is from the CEO of Tech Mahindra
 iti companiyon ko ab apana training centre kholana padaa he
 Top IT companies employ only 6 percent of IT engineers
 ham yah baat kai saal se sun rahe hai ki hamaare ejeeniyar kisi laayak nahin hai
 Common families are paying twenty-two million fees in private colleges by paying loans and after passing it is heard that 94% of IT engineers are not fit to be hired, then with whom is this cheating? kya yah dakaiti nahin he
 Are parents and students not cheated? kya yah sharmnaak nahin he ki bharat kii ejineering kii shiksha itani ghatiya he ki iske collejon se paas 94 fisadi ejeeniyar naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai
 Are the youth not being deceived? kya usne muft main padhai kii thi
 It is better to change your questions or else the situation will not change
 aapako pataa he ki elahabaad main upi lok seva ayog ke baahar chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 They demanded that the question papers of the second innings in the first innings of Hindi have been divided, so the examination should be canceled
 ayog ne pariksha radd bhi kar di magar sirf hindi kii
 Students started demanding that the entire exam be canceled, but the commission said that there was such a mess at the same center, so why cancel the rest of the exam
 is baat ko lekar chaatr ugr hue, police ne lathi charge kii, aath chaatro ko giraftaar kar liya
 Now seven of these students have been released so that they can appear for the examination on 21 June
 magar isamen shaamil samaajawaadee party kii netaa or elahabaad uniwarsity kii purv adhyaksh richa singh ko nahin choda gaya he
 He has been sent to jail
 tippaniyan The tenth result was to come on 20 June in Bihar
 17 lakh se adhik chaatr intazaar kar rahe the magar riselt ab 26 june ko aayega,kyonki aapako bataaya tha ki gopalganj zile main 42 hazaar uttar pustikaayen chori ho gai hai
 The same situation is with the farmers
 uttar pradesh ke amroha main kisaanon ne koi das hazaar bighas main tamaato ugaaya he
 In UP, most tomatoes are in Amroha itself, though mangoes are also very good
 yahaan ke kisaanon ne sadak ke kinare tomaamar phenk diya,kyonki bechney par bhi laagat nahin mil rahaa tha
 There is a crate of 30 kg
 kuch din pehle yahaan kii mandi main 80-90 rupee cret mil rahaa tha yani ek kilo ke 2 se 3 rupee mil rahe the, jabaki ek kilo tamaato ugane main 15 rupee kii laagat aati he
 We are also surprised by the change in the rate after this report from Amroha to Anwar Kamal
 haftaa bhar pehle 80 rupaya cret bhav tha, ab 280 se 290 rupee cret milane laga he
 That is, the price of Rs 8 to 9 kg is being available
 yah bhi kam he magar ek report ke baad 3 rupee se bhav 9 rupee kaise ho gaya he, ham bhi nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Farmers were saying that last year Pakistan got a lot of price due to export, so this time it took up more land on rent and did farming
 amroha zile main das hazaar bighas main tamaato kii kheti ho gai
 Many farmers are in debt due to loss
 amroha dilli se bahut dur nahin he
 There the farmer is not getting even 10 rupees for a kilo of tomatoes, but today the price of tomatoes was Rs 50 per kg at Katwaria Sarai in South Delhi
 safal main 44 rupaya kilo bhav he
 Now you tell me, in Amroha, the farmer is not getting 3 rupees per kg, while he is investing 15 rupees for growing one kilogram of tomatoes and 50 rupees tomatoes are being sold in Delhi
 aap bhi lut rahe hai or kisaan bhi lut rahaa he
 Then who is it that is carrying a profit of 47 rupees 
 in sawaalon kaa thos samaadhaan koi pesh nahin kar rahaa he
 Politics has turned into gossip
 tay aapako karnaa he ki gapp hi sunanaa he yaa kaam bhi dekhnaa he
 We had told in prime time that around six lakh students appeared in the examination at Awadh University and eighty percent of them failed
 yani 4 lakh 80 hazaar ke kareeb fail ho gaye
 The university released a press release on June 19, presenting the data in such a way that everything looks good
 is relies main likhaa he ki pariksha par prashn chinh lagaaya ja rahaa he
 We had put a question mark on the education here, what is the quality of studies that the number of people who fail to reach copying reaches millions
 kul milakar aankadon kii bazigaari kii gai he
 The difference between the percentage of government-funded colleges and the percentage of self-run colleges has been reported
 hamane overol jodakar bataaya tha ki 2017-18 main bie biessi, bi com ke teenon saal ke or post graduate str ke sava chah lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi
 If 80 percent failed, then about 4 lakh 80,000 students failed due to this
 biessi third year ke 80 pratishat se adhik chaatr fail hai
 In BSC first year, 56 percent students have failed
 sultanpur ke ganpat sahay post graduate mahavidhyalay ke ganit main final year main kareeb 300 chaatr the lekin inamen se maatr 20-25 chaatr paas hue hai
 Nearly 275 have failed
 19 june ko vaais chancelar ne ek meeting kar aankadon ko is tarah pesh kiya he jisase na lage ki chaar lakh bachche fail ho gaye
 Our emphasis is on why the quality of studies is so poor that students leave or fail in the name of stopping copying
 ham kab tak bhaagenge is sawaal se kya tab tak jab tak bharat ke saare noujvaan barbaad nahin kar die jate
 The June 19 press release lists the number of BA bcom BAC students and their percentages, but the pass percentage has been distributed among government-funded and self-funded institutions so that it does not look as if studying in government institutions Level is poor
 biessi dwitiya varsh main 23,358 chaatr shaamil hue or 20 pratishat safal hue
 Is it not shameful that 80 percent of the students fail? In BSC III year, 34,091 students attended and 19
 18 pratishat chaatr safal hue
 Is it not shameful that more than 80 percent of the students fail? 77,259 students attended and 59 in BA First Year
 95 pratishat paas hue
 Is it not shameful that 40 percent of the students fail? 61,610 students attended the BA Second Year and 79
 86 pratishat paas hue
 Isn't it embarrassing for 20 percent of the students to fail? 40,442 students attended and 43 in bsc first year
 01 pratishat paas hue
 Isn't it embarrassing for 57 percent of the students to fail? yahi khel he
 The percentage of students who failed is divided into government and private
 agar privet main rigelt itnaa kharaab he to vishvavidhyalay yah bataae ki vah kya ection lene ja rahaa he
 The pass percentage in government-funded colleges may be between 50 and 70 percent in sight, but the failure of 20 to 40 percent students is also a question on its quality
 par ek baat samaj nahin ai
 On February 22, before the examination started, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Manoj Dixit, said in a press conference that this time six lakh 11 thousand 680 students will be included in the graduation examinations
 magar 19 june kii press release main jo hisaab diya he uske anusaar to pariksha dene vaale chaatro kii sankhya 3 lakh 31 hazaar 239 hi he
 We did not understand where the remaining 2 lakh 80 thousand 441 students went
 kya bibie or bisie jaise course kaa hisaab isamen se hataa diya gaya he taaki fail hone vaale chaatro kii total sankhya kam lage
 We had shown in the University Series that many colleges in Awadh University do not have sufficient number of teachers
 kai collejon main sirf kaagaj par hi hai vahaan padhai nahin hoti
 i raised this question not for myself but for the children of ordinary families of that poor area, why are they being given poor quality education
 ab uniwarsity ne kaha he ki 100 uttar pustikaon ke sample duusari uniwarsity main jaanch ke liye bheje jaaenge taaki isaki pushti ho sake ki jaanch main gadabadi to nahin hui he
 There will be no fee for this and students can apply to include their copy in this 100 copy if they wish
 kya yah ajeeb nahi he
 If five hundred students apply then what will the university do
 hamaara sawaal ek or he ek garib ilaake ke chaatro se uttar pustika kii jaanch ke liye 3000 rupee lenaa kahaan tak uchit he
 This system came into force 6 months ago or is implemented now
 It does not mean that the question of why 3000 rupees will be taken for investigation
 galati uniwarsity kii or paisa chaatr kaa
 The system here is to give Rs 300 first and then get a photo copy of the answer book
 usamen lagata he ki gadabadi hui he to phir 3000 hazaar dijie taaki jaanch ho
 What is the intelligence to earn money
 avadh uniwarsity hi nahin duusari kai uniwarsity main yah sab hone laga he
 Students raise questions but no one is listening
 avadh uniwarsity hi nahin aap june ke pehle saptaah ke hindi ke akhabaaron ko dekhie
 Magazine, Amar Ujala, Jagran, Hindustan
 bundelkhand vishvavidhyalay main 20 pratishat chaatr hi paas hue hai
 In BSC first year 88 percent students have failed
 privet collejon kaa riselt sabase kharaab rahaa he
 Think this is the condition of private colleges
 yahaan bhi dobaaraa copy check karaane ke liye 3000 rupee dene padate hai
 Copying has been stopped is a good thing, but the reality that has come out is worse than that
 in collejon kaa rigelt itnaa kharaab kyon hai
 The results of Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University of Kanpur are also showing that apart from stopping the copying, there is a need to pay attention to the quality of studies
 yah video kuch din purana he
 The students are angry at the failure and are demanding a re-examination of the answer sheet
 register sanjay kumaar ne bataaya biessi pratham varsh main 93 hazaar chaatr pariksha main shaamil hue the
 49 of these
 9 bachche hi paas hue hai
 38
 24 pratishat fail hue hai or 11 pratishat ke kareeb pariksha main baithe hi nahin
 In BSC Part Two, only 33 percent of the students could pass in 94620
 58 pratishat ke kareeb fail hue hai
 In BSC Third Year, close to 98 thousand students appeared in the examination, in which only 57% passed
 39 percent fail ho gaye
 One in 130 students passed out in a college in Kanpur Dehat
 ye haal he padhai kaa
 a committee was also formed on the demand of students that there was no disturbance in the assessment, but the committee has given a clean chit to the university
 kanpur uniwarsity ke biessi ke teenon saal main kul 1 lakh 28 hazaar chaatr fail hue hai
 Isn't this a serious issue? Now think what is going on in studies that so many students are failing
 ye bharat kii utpaadakta yaa arthvyavastha main kya yogadan karenge
 Between fifty thousand and one lakh lecturers professor positions are vacant in universities in India
 uniwarsity kaa prashasan khush he ki nakal nahin hone di lekin kya yah rone vaali baat nahin he ki college ke college chaatr fail ho gaye
 No one is accountable for what they have been taught
 kyon hamaare collejon kii padhai itani kharaab he ki chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 This question is from the three lecturers and students who are getting salaries
 kya chaatr samaj rahe hai ki ve apane saath kya kar rahe hai
 It is not just about Kanpur and Awadh University
 isi 4 june ko times of india main pankaj dabhol kii ek khabar chhapi he
 94 percent of IT graduates are not eligible for employment
 yah bayaan tech mahindra ke siio kaa he
 IT companies now have to open their own training centers
 chotii kii iti companiyaan maatr 6 pratishat iti ejeeniyar ko naukari par rakhti hai
 We have been hearing for many years that our engineers are not fit
 aam parivaar karz lekar bees-bees lakh fees dekar privet collejon main padhaa rahe hai or paas hone ke baad yah sunne ko mili ki 94 fisadi iti ejeeniyar naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai to yah kiske saath dhokhaa he
 Isn't it a robbery? kya maa baap or chaatr ke saath dhokhaa nahin hai
 Isn't it shameful that India's engineering education is so inferior that 94 per cent of engineers from its colleges are not fit to be hired? kya naujavaanon ke saath dhokhaa nahin ho rahaa he
 Did she study for free? behatar he apane sawaal badal len varanaa halaat nahin badalenge
 You know that students demonstrated outside the UP Public Service Commission in Allahabad
 inaki maang thi ki hindi kii pehali pari main duusari pari ke prashn patr bant gaye hai, isliye pariksha radd ho
 The Commission also canceled the examination but did only Hindi
 chaatr maang karne lage ki sari pariksha radd ho magar ayog kaa kahana tha ki ek hi centre par aisi gadabadi hui he, isliye baaki pariksha kyon radd karen
 Students were agitated about this, police charged lathi, arrested eight students
 ab inamen se saat chaatro ko chhod diya gaya he taaki ve 21 june kii pariksha main shaamil ho saken
 But the Samajwadi Party leader and former Allahabad University president Richa Singh has not been left out
 unhen jail bhej diya gaya he
 The comments bihar main 20 june ko dasvin kaa riselt aana tha
 More than 17 lakh students were waiting, but the result will now come on 26 June, because you were told that 42 thousand answer sheets have been stolen in Gopalganj district
 yahi haal kisaanon kaa he
 In Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, farmers have grown tomatoes in ten thousand bighas
 upi main sabase adhik tamaato amroha main hi hota he vaise aam bhi khub hota he
 The farmers here threw the tamaras on the side of the road, because the cost was not available even if they were sold
 30 kilo kaa ek cret hota he
 a few days ago, there was a crate of 80-90 rupees in the mandi here, that is, 2 to 3 rupees per kg, while it costs Rs 15 to grow one kg of tomatoes
 amroha se anwar kamaal kii is report ke baad jo rate main badlaav aayaa he usase ham bhi hairaan he
 a week ago, there was a crate price of 80 rupees, now 280 to 290 crates are available
 yani 8 rupee se 9 rupee kilo ke bhav mil rahe hai
 This is also less, but after a report, how the price has gone from 3 rupees to 9 rupees, we are unable to understand
 kisaan kah rahe the ki pichley saal pakistan niryaat ke kaaran khub bhav mila to is baar zyaada zamin kiraaye par lekar kheti kar lee
 In Amroha district, tomato cultivated in ten thousand bighas
 kai kisaan nuksaan ke kaaran karze main aa gaye hai
 Amroha is not far from Delhi
 vahaan kisaan ko ek kilo tamaato ke 10 rupee bhi nahin mil rahe hai lekin aaj hi dakshin dilli ke katwaria sarai main tamaato kaa bhav 50 rupee kilo tha
 There is a price of 44 rupees kg in the successful
 ab aap hi bataaiye amroha main kisaan ko 3 rupee kilo bhav nahin mil rahe hai, jabaki vah ek kilo tomaamar ugane main 15 rupee laga de rahaa he or dilli main 50 rupee kilo tamaato bik rahaa he
 You are also being plundered and the farmer is also being plundered
 phir yah koun he jo 47 rupee kaa munafa le ja rahaa he
 No one is offering concrete solutions to these questions
 raajnneeti gappabaazi main badal gai he
 You have to decide whether to listen to the chat or see the work
 hamane overol jodakar bataaya tha ki 2017-18 main bie biessi, bi com ke teenon saal ke or post graduate str ke sava chah lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi

 a committee was also formed on the demand of students that there was no disturbance in the assessment, but the committee has given a clean chit to the university
 kanpur uniwarsity ke biessi ke teenon saal main kul 1 lakh 28 hazaar chaatr fail hue hai
 Isn't this a serious issue? Now think what is going on in studies that so many students are failing

 Between fifty thousand and one lakh lecturers professor positions are vacant in universities in India
 uniwarsity kaa prashasan khush he ki nakal nahin hone di lekin kya yah rone vaali baat nahin he ki college ke college chaatr fail ho gaye
 No one is accountable for what they have been taught
 kyon hamaare collejon kii padhai itani kharaab he ki chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 This question is from the three lecturers and students who are getting salaries
 kya chaatr samaj rahe hai ki ve apane saath kya kar rahe hai
 It is not just about Kanpur and Awadh University
 isi 4 june ko times of india main pankaj dabhol kii ek khabar chhapi he
 94 percent of IT graduates are not eligible for employment

 IT companies now have to open their own training centers

 Isn't it a robbery? kya maa baap or chaatr ke saath dhokhaa nahin hai
 Isn't it shameful that India's engineering education is so inferior that 94 per cent of engineers from its colleges are not fit to be hired? kya naujavaanon ke saath dhokhaa nahin ho rahaa he
 Did she study for free? behatar he apane sawaal badal len varanaa halaat nahin badalenge
 You know that students demonstrated outside the UP Public Service Commission in Allahabad
 inaki maang thi ki hindi kii pehali pari main duusari pari ke prashn patr bant gaye hai, isliye pariksha radd ho
 The Commission also canceled the examination but did only Hindi
 chaatr maang karne lage ki sari pariksha radd ho magar ayog kaa kahana tha ki ek hi centre par aisi gadabadi hui he, isliye baaki pariksha kyon radd karen
 Students were agitated about this, police charged lathi, arrested eight students
 ab inamen se saat chaatro ko chhod diya gaya he taaki ve 21 june kii pariksha main shaamil ho saken
 But the Samajwadi Party leader and former Allahabad University president Richa Singh has not been left out
 unhen jail bhej diya gaya he
 The comments bihar main 20 june ko dasvin kaa riselt aana tha
 More than 17 lakh students were waiting, but the result will now come on 26 June, because you were told that 42 thousand answer sheets have been stolen in Gopalganj district
 yahi haal kisaanon kaa he
 In Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, farmers have grown tomatoes in ten thousand bighas
 upi main sabase adhik tamaato amroha main hi hota he vaise aam bhi khub hota he
 The farmers here threw the tamaras on the side of the road, because the cost was not available even if they were sold
 30 kilo kaa ek cret hota he
 a few days ago, there was a crate of 80-90 rupees in the mandi here, that is, 2 to 3 rupees per kg, while it costs Rs 15 to grow one kg of tomatoes
 amroha se anwar kamaal kii is report ke baad jo rate main badlaav aayaa he usase ham bhi hairaan he
 a week ago, there was a crate price of 80 rupees, now 280 to 290 crates are available
 yani 8 rupee se 9 rupee kilo ke bhav mil rahe hai
 This is also less, but after a report, how the price has gone from 3 rupees to 9 rupees, we are unable to understand
 kisaan kah rahe the ki pichley saal pakistan niryaat ke kaaran khub bhav mila to is baar zyaada zamin kiraaye par lekar kheti kar lee
 In Amroha district, tomato cultivated in ten thousand bighas
 kai kisaan nuksaan ke kaaran karze main aa gaye hai
 Amroha is not far from Delhi
 vahaan kisaan ko ek kilo tamaato ke 10 rupee bhi nahin mil rahe hai lekin aaj hi dakshin dilli ke katwaria sarai main tamaato kaa bhav 50 rupee kilo tha
 There is a price of 44 rupees kg in the successful
 ab aap hi bataaiye amroha main kisaan ko 3 rupee kilo bhav nahin mil rahe hai, jabaki vah ek kilo tomaamar ugane main 15 rupee laga de rahaa he or dilli main 50 rupee kilo tamaato bik rahaa he
 You are also being plundered and the farmer is also being plundered
 phir yah koun he jo 47 rupee kaa munafa le ja rahaa he
 No one is offering concrete solutions to these questions
 raajnneeti gappabaazi main badal gai he
 You have to decide whether to listen to the chat or see the work
 19 june ko vaais chancelar ne ek meeting kar aankadon ko is tarah pesh kiya he jisase na lage ki chaar lakh bachche fail ho gaye
 Our emphasis is on why the quality of studies is so poor that students leave or fail in the name of stopping copying
 ham kab tak bhaagenge is sawaal se kya tab tak jab tak bharat ke saare noujvaan barbaad nahin kar die jate
 The June 19 press release lists the number of BA bcom BAC students and their percentages, but the pass percentage has been distributed among government-funded and self-funded institutions so that it does not look as if studying in government institutions Level is poor
 biessi dwitiya varsh main 23,358 chaatr shaamil hue or 20 pratishat safal hue
 Is it not shameful that 80 percent of the students fail? In BSC III year, 34,091 students attended and 19
 18 pratishat chaatr safal hue
 Is it not shameful that more than 80 percent of the students fail? 77,259 students attended and 59 in BA First Year
 95 pratishat paas hue
 Is it not shameful that 40 percent of the students fail? 61,610 students attended the BA Second Year and 79
 86 pratishat paas hue
 Isn't it embarrassing for 20 percent of the students to fail? 40,442 students attended and 43 in bsc first year
 01 pratishat paas hue
 Isn't it embarrassing for 57 percent of the students to fail? yahi khel he
 The percentage of students who failed is divided into government and private
 agar privet main rigelt itnaa kharaab he to vishvavidhyalay yah bataae ki vah kya ection lene ja rahaa he
 The pass percentage in government-funded colleges may be between 50 and 70 percent in sight, but the failure of 20 to 40 percent students is also a question on its quality
 par ek baat samaj nahin ai
 On February 22, before the examination started, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Manoj Dixit, said in a press conference that this time six lakh 11 thousand 680 students will be included in the graduation examinations
 magar 19 june kii press release main jo hisaab diya he uske anusaar to pariksha dene vaale chaatro kii sankhya 3 lakh 31 hazaar 239 hi he
 We did not understand where the remaining 2 lakh 80 thousand 441 students went
 kya bibie or bisie jaise course kaa hisaab isamen se hataa diya gaya he taaki fail hone vaale chaatro kii total sankhya kam lage
 We had shown in the University Series that many colleges in Awadh University do not have sufficient number of teachers
 kai collejon main sirf kaagaj par hi hai vahaan padhai nahin hoti
 i raised this question not for myself but for the children of ordinary families of that poor area, why are they being given poor quality education
 ab uniwarsity ne kaha he ki 100 uttar pustikaon ke sample duusari uniwarsity main jaanch ke liye bheje jaaenge taaki isaki pushti ho sake ki jaanch main gadabadi to nahin hui he
 There will be no fee for this and students can apply to include their copy in this 100 copy if they wish
 kya yah ajeeb nahi he
 If five hundred students apply then what will the university do
 hamaara sawaal ek or he ek garib ilaake ke chaatro se uttar pustika kii jaanch ke liye 3000 rupee lenaa kahaan tak uchit he
 This system came into force 6 months ago or is implemented now
 It does not mean that the question of why 3000 rupees will be taken for investigation
 galati uniwarsity kii or paisa chaatr kaa
 The system here is to give Rs 300 first and then get a photo copy of the answer book
 usamen lagata he ki gadabadi hui he to phir 3000 hazaar dijie taaki jaanch ho
 What is the intelligence to earn money
 avadh uniwarsity hi nahin duusari kai uniwarsity main yah sab hone laga he
 Students raise questions but no one is listening

 Copying has been stopped is a good thing, but the reality that has come out is worse than that

 The results of Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University of Kanpur are also showing that apart from stopping the copying, there is a need to pay attention to the quality of studies

 kyon hamaare collejon kii padhai itani kharaab he ki chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 This question is from the three lecturers and students who are getting salaries
 kya chaatr samaj rahe hai ki ve apane saath kya kar rahe hai
 It is not just about Kanpur and Awadh University
 isi 4 june ko times of india main pankaj dabhol kii ek khabar chhapi he
 94 percent of IT graduates are not eligible for employment
 yah bayaan tech mahindra ke siio kaa he
 IT companies now have to open their own training centers
 chotii kii iti companiyaan maatr 6 pratishat iti ejeeniyar ko naukari par rakhti hai
 We have been hearing for many years that our engineers are not fit
 aam parivaar karz lekar bees-bees lakh fees dekar privet collejon main padhaa rahe hai or paas hone ke baad yah sunne ko mili ki 94 fisadi iti ejeeniyar naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai to yah kiske saath dhokhaa he
 Isn't it a robbery? kya maa baap or chaatr ke saath dhokhaa nahin hai
 Isn't it shameful that India's engineering education is so inferior that 94 per cent of engineers from its colleges are not fit to be hired? kya naujavaanon ke saath dhokhaa nahin ho rahaa he
 Did she study for free? behatar he apane sawaal badal len varanaa halaat nahin badalenge
 You know that students demonstrated outside the UP Public Service Commission in Allahabad
 inaki maang thi ki hindi kii pehali pari main duusari pari ke prashn patr bant gaye hai, isliye pariksha radd ho
 The Commission also canceled the examination but did only Hindi
 chaatr maang karne lage ki sari pariksha radd ho magar ayog kaa kahana tha ki ek hi centre par aisi gadabadi hui he, isliye baaki pariksha kyon radd karen
 Students were agitated about this, police charged lathi, arrested eight students
 ab inamen se saat chaatro ko chhod diya gaya he taaki ve 21 june kii pariksha main shaamil ho saken
 But the Samajwadi Party leader and former Allahabad University president Richa Singh has not been left out
 unhen jail bhej diya gaya he
 The comments bihar main 20 june ko dasvin kaa riselt aana tha
 More than 17 lakh students were waiting, but the result will now come on 26 June, because you were told that 42 thousand answer sheets have been stolen in Gopalganj district
 yahi haal kisaanon kaa he
 In Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, farmers have grown tomatoes in ten thousand bighas
 upi main sabase adhik tamaato amroha main hi hota he vaise aam bhi khub hota he
 The farmers here threw the tamaras on the side of the road, because the cost was not available even if they were sold
 30 kilo kaa ek cret hota he
 a few days ago, there was a crate of 80-90 rupees in the mandi here, that is, 2 to 3 rupees per kg, while it costs Rs 15 to grow one kg of tomatoes
 amroha se anwar kamaal kii is report ke baad jo rate main badlaav aayaa he usase ham bhi hairaan he
 a week ago, there was a crate price of 80 rupees, now 280 to 290 crates are available
 yani 8 rupee se 9 rupee kilo ke bhav mil rahe hai
 This is also less, but after a report, how the price has gone from 3 rupees to 9 rupees, we are unable to understand
 kisaan kah rahe the ki pichley saal pakistan niryaat ke kaaran khub bhav mila to is baar zyaada zamin kiraaye par lekar kheti kar lee
 In Amroha district, tomato cultivated in ten thousand bighas
 kai kisaan nuksaan ke kaaran karze main aa gaye hai
 Amroha is not far from Delhi
 vahaan kisaan ko ek kilo tamaato ke 10 rupee bhi nahin mil rahe hai lekin aaj hi dakshin dilli ke katwaria sarai main tamaato kaa bhav 50 rupee kilo tha
 There is a price of 44 rupees kg in the successful
 ab aap hi bataaiye amroha main kisaan ko 3 rupee kilo bhav nahin mil rahe hai, jabaki vah ek kilo tomaamar ugane main 15 rupee laga de rahaa he or dilli main 50 rupee kilo tamaato bik rahaa he
 You are also being plundered and the farmer is also being plundered
 phir yah koun he jo 47 rupee kaa munafa le ja rahaa he
 No one is offering concrete solutions to these questions
 raajnneeti gappabaazi main badal gai he
 You have to decide whether to listen to the chat or see the work
 hamane uniwarsity series main dikhaaya tha ki avadh uniwarsity ke kai collejon main paryaapt sankhya main shikshak nahin hai
 Many colleges are only on paper, there is no education there
 yah sawaal maine apane liye nahin balki us garib ilaake ke saadhaaran pariwaron ke bacchon ke liye uthaaya tha ki aakhir unhen ghatiya quality kii shiksha kyon di ja rahi he
 Now the university has said that samples of 100 answer sheets will be sent to another university for examination so that it can be confirmed that there is no disturbance in the investigation
 iske liye fees nahin lagegi or chaatr chahen to is 100 copy main apni copy shaamil karaane kaa aavedan de sakate hai
 Isn't it strange? agar paanch sau chaatro ne aavedan kar diya to phir uniwarsity kya karegi
 Our question is another, how far is it appropriate to take Rs 3000 from students of a poor area to check the answer book
 yah vyavastha 6 maah pehle lagu hui yaa ab lagu hui isse matlab nahin he sawaal he ki 3000 rupee jaanch ke kyon liye jaaenge
 Mistake of university and money of student
 yahaan system yah he ki 300 rupee pehle dijie phir uttar pustika kii photo copy hasil kiijie
 If it seems that there is a disturbance then give 3000 thousand so that the investigation can be done
 kya hoshiyaari he paisa kamaane kii
 Not only Avadh University, this is happening in many other universities
 chaatr sawaal uthaate hai magar koi sunne vaala nahin he
 Not only Avadh University, you should look at the Hindi newspapers of the first week of June
 patrika, amar ujaalaa, jaagran, hindustan
 Only 20 percent students have passed in Bundelkhand University
 biessi pratham varsh main 88 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 The result of private colleges has been the worst
 sochie privet collejon kaa ye haal he
 Here, again, 3000 rupees have to be paid for a copy check
 nakal roak di gai acchhee baat he magar jo asaliyat saamne ai he wo usase bhi buree bhi baat he
 Why are the results of these colleges so bad? kanpur ke chhatrapati shahu ji maharaj vishvavidhyalay ke nattejey bhi bataa rahe hai ki nakal par roak ke saath saath padhai kii quality par dhyaan dene kii zarurat he
 This video is a few days old
 chaatr fail hone par naaraaz hai or uttar pustika kii dobaaraa jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai

 This is the condition of studies
 chaatro kii maang par cameti bhi bani ki kahin moolyankan main gadabadi to nahin hui magar cameti ne uniwarsity ko clin chit diya he
 a total of 1 lakh 28 thousand students have failed in the three years of b

 kya yah gambhir masalaa nahin he? ab aap sochie ki kya padhai ho rahi he ki itane chaatr fail ho rahe hai
 What will these contribute to India's productivity or economy
 bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon main pachaas hazaar se ek lakh ke bich lekturer professor ke pad khaali hai
 The administration of the university is happy that it is not allowed to be copied, but is it not a cry that college students failed in college
 unhen kya padhaayaa gaya kya isaki javabdehi kisi kii nahin he
 Why our colleges are so poor that students are not able to pass
 yah sawaal vahaan vetan paa rahe professor lekturer or chaatro teenon se he
 Do students understand what they are doing with themselves? baat sirf kanpur or avadh uniwarsity kii nahin

 ham yah baat kai saal se sun rahe hai ki hamaare ejeeniyar kisi laayak nahin hai
 Common families are paying twenty-two million fees in private colleges by paying loans and after passing it is heard that 94% of IT engineers are not fit to be hired, then with whom is this cheating? kya yah dakaiti nahin he
 Are parents and students not cheated? kya yah sharmnaak nahin he ki bharat kii ejineering kii shiksha itani ghatiya he ki iske collejon se paas 94 fisadi ejeeniyar naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai
 Are the youth not being deceived? kya usne muft main padhai kii thi
 It is better to change your questions or else the situation will not change
 aapako pataa he ki elahabaad main upi lok seva ayog ke baahar chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 They demanded that the question papers of the second innings in the first innings of Hindi have been divided, so the examination should be canceled
 ayog ne pariksha radd bhi kar di magar sirf hindi kii
 Students started demanding that the entire exam be canceled, but the commission said that there was such a mess at the same center, so why cancel the rest of the exam
 is baat ko lekar chaatr ugr hue, police ne lathi charge kii, aath chaatro ko giraftaar kar liya
 Now seven of these students have been released so that they can appear for the examination on 21 June
 magar isamen shaamil samaajawaadee party kii netaa or elahabaad uniwarsity kii purv adhyaksh richa singh ko nahin choda gaya he

 The same situation is with the farmers
 uttar pradesh ke amroha main kisaanon ne koi das hazaar bighas main tamaato ugaaya he

 There is a crate of 30 kg
 kuch din pehle yahaan kii mandi main 80-90 rupee cret mil rahaa tha yani ek kilo ke 2 se 3 rupee mil rahe the, jabaki ek kilo tamaato ugane main 15 rupee kii laagat aati he
 We are also surprised by the change in the rate after this report from Amroha to Anwar Kamal
 haftaa bhar pehle 80 rupaya cret bhav tha, ab 280 se 290 rupee cret milane laga he
 That is, the price of Rs 8 to 9 kg is being available
 yah bhi kam he magar ek report ke baad 3 rupee se bhav 9 rupee kaise ho gaya he, ham bhi nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Farmers were saying that last year Pakistan got a lot of price due to export, so this time it took up more land on rent and did farming
 amroha zile main das hazaar bighas main tamaato kii kheti ho gai
 Many farmers are in debt due to loss
 amroha dilli se bahut dur nahin he
 There the farmer is not getting even 10 rupees for a kilo of tomatoes, but today the price of tomatoes was Rs 50 per kg at Katwaria Sarai in South Delhi

 Now you tell me, in Amroha, the farmer is not getting 3 rupees per kg, while he is investing 15 rupees for growing one kilogram of tomatoes and 50 rupees tomatoes are being sold in Delhi
 aap bhi lut rahe hai or kisaan bhi lut rahaa he
 Then who is it that is carrying a profit of 47 rupees

 'diwaar' naam se mashhoor bharosemand ballebaaj rahul dravid shuukravaar ko cardiff main england ke saath hone vaale ekadivasiy match ke saath apane ekadivasiy antarrashtriya kariyar kaa samaapan karenge
 While Dravid's effort will be to make this match memorable with a personal performance, Mahendra Singh Dhoni would also like to win this match and let the Indian team fare well for this great player
 dravid ne agast main do varsh ke baad bhartiya ekadivasiy cricket team main vaapasi kii thi
 Dravid, who had been an integral part of the Indian team for the past decade and a half, played his last ODI against the West Indies during the Champions Trophy in Johannesburg on September 30, 2009 before being selected to play against England
 iske baad team ko yuva rup dene ke liye unhen team se baahar kar diya gaya
 Dravid, who led the side in the 2007 ICC World Cup, was dropped from the team after a poor performance in the ODI series against Australia but in 2009 he returned to the team once again
 vah champiens trophy main khele
 This comeback lasted for just six matches
 dakshin africa ke saath kheli jane vaali ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa ke liye dravid ko team main shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 Dravid had to stay out of the team since then
 unki gairmaujuudagi main bharat ne vishwa cap jeeta to yah nishchit ho gaya ki ab unki vaapasi asambhav he lekin england kii oochaal bhari pichon par bhartiya ballebaajon kii naakaami ne chayankartaaon ko dravid par bharosa karne ko majaboor kar diya
 However, Dravid, who scored three centuries in the four-match series played with England, could not show the bat in the last ODI series of his life
 dravid ne pehle match main do ran banaae jabaki duusare match main unke balle se 32 ran nikle
 In the third match, Dravid was again dismissed for two while in the fourth match, he was able to score 19 runs
 ab tak 343 maichon kii 317 pariyon main 40 baar naabad rahete hue 39
 Dravid, who has scored 10820 runs at an average of 06, is nothing new in any series, but this great player has played hard-hitting matches for the team on many occasions in his 15-year career
 ekadivasiy maichon main dravid ke naam kai ricard darj hai
 He shared a 331-run partnership for the second wicket against New Zealand in 1999 with Sachin Tendulkar in Hyderabad, which is still a world record in terms of odis
 iske alaava dravid ne saurav ganguli ke saath 1999 main hi taantan main srilanka ke khilaaf duusare wicket ke liye 318 ran jode the
 Dravid is one of the most successful batsmen of odis
 vah un aath ballebaajon main se ek hai, jinhone ekadivasiy maichon main 10, 000 se adhik ran banaae hai
 These include Sachin and Ganguly

 3 DAYS TO GO! xxrep 4 ! a video posted by ★ KATRINA KAIF ★ (@katrinakaifdaily) onfeb 9, 2016 at 4:33am PST North Korea has tested the ballistic missile again, ignoring the warning from the international community, including the US
 dakshin korea kii sena ne yah jaankaree di
 At the same time, the US has now warned to retaliate against North Korea
 donald trump ke raashtrapati banane ke baad se ab tak uttar korea nau baar missile pareekshan kar chukaa he
 The Pentagon has also confirmed that North Korea will conduct missile tests on Saturday
 sienen ne america adhikariyon ke hawaale se bataaya ki uttar korea ne madhyam duuri tak maar karne main sakasham KN-17 belistic missile ko mobile se laanch kiya, jo japan sagar tak nahin pahunch saki
 US Army Pacific Command spokesman Dave Benham said the North Korean ballistic missile was launched at 10:33 am Saturday
 haalanki abhi tak uttar korea kii ore se is babat koi pratikriya nahin ai he
 The renewed ballistic missile from North Korea has increased global concern amid deep tensions with the US
 dakshin korian sena pramukh ke mutabik shanivaar tadake yah missile uttar korea kii rajdhani pyongyong ke uttar sthit pyongan praant ke ek pareekshan sthal se laanch kii gai
 Earlier, North Korea had test-fired a missile about 12 days ago
 usne yuan main dhamkee bhi di thi ki vah har hafte missile pareekshan karegaa
 At the same time, the White House said that information about North Korea's missile test has been given to US President Donald Trump
 trump bole- uttar korea ne china kaa apmaan kiyamerica raashtrapati donald trump ne twit kar kaha ki uttar korea ne missile pareekshan kar china kaa apmaan kiya he
 This is very bad
 darasal, china ne uttar korea se missile pareekshan or parmaanu kaarykram ko band karne ko kaha tha
 In such a situation, Trump is seen trying to bring China in his favor
 unka yah bayaan china ko uttar korea ke khilaaf uksaave ke rup main mana ja rahaa he
 North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today
 Bad!— Donald J
 Trump (@realdonaldtrump) April 28, 2017 North Korea's missile test also failed
 US government sources say that this missile test of North Korea failed
 korian prayadviya main maujuuda samay main gahraae tanaav ke bich uttar korea ke is kadam ke khilaaf america sainya karrwai kar saktaa he
 US President Donald Trump has also warned in open words that North Korean Kenski dictator Kim Jong, who has become a cancer for the world, needs his treatment
 america kar saktaa he sainya karrwidhuniya ke sabase shaktishaalee desh america ke raashtrapati ke in lafjon ko halke main nahin liya ja saktaa he
 Trump has also made it clear that there will be a fierce conflict with North Korea
 iske alaava america videsh mantri rex tilarsan bhi kah chuke hai ki america uttar korea ke khilaaf sainya karrwai karnaa chahta he
 In such a situation, the US can take military action in response to North Korea's missile test
 vahiin, uttar korea bhi america par parmaanu hamale kii chetavanee de chukaa he

 Spread over an area of three square kilometers, the height of this fort is 35 feet
 yah kila madhyakaalin sthapaty ke adbhut namoonon main se ek he
 It is the main monument of the city of Gwalior which is situated on a small hill called Gopanchal
 laal balua pathar se nirmit yah kila desh ke sabase bade kile main se ek he or iskaa bhartiya itihaas main ek mahatvapurn sthaan he
 The history of the fort of Gwalior is very rich
in the recorded figures of historians, this fort was built in 727 AD by a local chieftain named Suryasena, who was a resident of Sinhonia village, 12 km from this fort
 is kile par kai rajput raajaaon ne raaj kiya he
 After the establishment of the fort, it was ruled by the Pala dynasty for about 989 years
 iske baad isapar pratihaar vansh ne raaj kiya
 In 1023 AD Mohammad Ghazni attacked this fort but suffered defeat
 1196 isvi main lambey gheraabandi ke baad qutubuddin aibak ne is kile ko apni adheen kiya lekin 1211 isvi main use haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Then in 1231 AD Iltutmish, the founder of the slave dynasty, subjugated it
 iske baad maharaja devvaram ne gwalior par tomars rajya kii sthapana kii
 The most famous king of this dynasty was Mansingh (1486–1516) who built the Gujari Mahal for his wife Mrignayani
 1398 se 1505 isvi tak is kile par tomars vansh kaa raaj rahaa
 Mansingh accepted Ibrahim Lodi's subordination during this period
 lodi kii maut ke baad jab maansingh ke bete vikramaditya ko humayun ne dilli darbar main bulaayaa to unhone aane se inkaar kar diya
 After this, Babur attacked Gwalior and captured it and ruled it
 lekin shershah suri ne babar ke bete humayun ko haraakar is kile ko suri vansh ke adheen kiya
 After Sher Shah's death in 1540 his son Islam Shah changed his capital from Delhi to Gwalior for some time
 islam shah kii maut ke baad unke uttaradhikari adil shah suri ne gwalior kii raksha kaa jimmaa hem chandra vikramaditya (hemu) ko saunp khud chunaar chale gaye
 Hemu then won 22 battles between 1553–56, suppressing many rebellions
 1556 main hemu ne hi panipat kii duusari ladaai main agra or dilli main akbar ko haraakar hindu raaj kii sthapana kii
 After this Hemu changed his capital back to Delhi and started ruling from Purana Qila
 iske baad akbar ne gwalior ke kile par akraman kar ise apane kabje main liya or ise karagar main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 After the Mughal dynasty, it was ruled by Rana and Jats, then the Marathas hoisted their flag on it
 1736 main jat raja maharaja bhim singh rana ne is par apana aadhipaty jamaaya or 1756 tak ise apane adheen rakhaa
 In 1779, the Maratha Chhatrap of the Scindia clan won it and stationed the army in the fort
 lekin ise east india company ne chin liya
 Then in 1780 its control went to Gound Rana Chhatar Singh who took it away from the Marathas
 iske baad 1784 main mahadji sindhiya ne ise waapas hasil kiya
 Between 1804 and 1844, the control of the fort changed between the British and Scindia
 haalanki janvari 1844 main maharaajapur kii ladaai ke baad yah kila antat sindhiya ke kabje main aa gaya
 On 1 June 1858, Rani Laxmibai along with Maratha rebels captured this fort
 lekin is jeet ke jashn main vyast vidrohiyon par 16 june ko general huge ke netritv vaali british sena ne hamalaa kar diya
 Rani Laxmibai fought hard and did not allow the British to capture the fort
 lekin is dauraan unhen goli lag gai or agle din (17 june ko) hi unki mrityu ho gai
 In Indian history, it is described as the Battle of Gwalior
 lakshmibai kii mrityu ke baad agrejon ne agle teen din main hi kile par kabja kar liya
 What to see in the fort The fort and its walls are being taken care of very well
 isamen kai aitihaasik smarak, buddha or jain mandir, mahal (guzari mahal, maansingh mahal, jahangir mahal, karan mahal, shahjahan mahal) maujuud hai
 The fort is mainly divided into two parts

" " unhone yah bhi kaha, "mujhe khushi he ki pramukh vipakshi dal ne sansad main aam raay kii jarurat ko mahasoos kiya he
 But it is the responsibility of both the main opposition party and the government to form a consensus
 " Manmohan said, "sadly, the major opposition party has never been able to digest that he got out of power in 2004
 " The comment created a furore in the House and BJP members strongly opposed it
