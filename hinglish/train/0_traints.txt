 Is the Indian government wasting thousands of crores of statues, while India's neighboring country China is building state-of-the-art infrastructure for that much money? Social media users are sharing a picture and comparing the expenditure on the Statue of Unity to a magnificent bridge in China
 is tasviir ke saath daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki jitne paise main bharat sarkaar ne gujarat main stachu of unity kaa nirmaan karaayaa, utane hi paise yani 3000 karod main china kii sarkaar ne ek pul banavaa daalaa
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the claim being made with the viral picture is false
 fasebuk yujar 'jagadeesh Jagadeesh' ne 'அன்பால் இணைவோம் ANBAL INAIVOM' naam ke ek public group main yah tasviir 6 november kosheiraki he
 The archived version of this post can be viewed
 is tasviir ko do tasveeron ko milakar, aapas main donon kii tulana karte hue banaaya gaya he
 In this picture going viral, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi is seen with the Statue of Unity on one side and Chinese President Xi Jinping with a bridge on the other side
 story likhe jane tak is post ko saikadon yugers ne share kiya he
 The post has a caption written in Tamil which will mean in Hindi: 'this is the difference between a sensible and a foolish man
 'in donon tasveeron main donon deshon ke naam ke saath 3000 karod rupee likhaa hua he
 Comparing the expenditure incurred by the Indian government on the construction of the Statue of Unity in the picture, it is claimed that this amount is equal to the amount spent by China on a bridge
 yahi tasviir sthaneey media main phek news failaane ke liebodnamki gai he
 What is true AFWA first cropped this picture and google it with the help of reserv image search
 is search main hamen 'denyang kunshaan grand brij' (danyang Kunshan Grand Bridge) kii tasviren milin
 It is the longest bridge in the world that connects two cities Shanghai and Nanjing in China's Jiangsu Province

 According to this report, it is actually a part of the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge, not the Danyang Kunshan Grand Bridge, as suggested in the Google reverse image search
 jiosou be brij july, 2011 main janata ke liye kholaa gaya tha or yah yah vishesh rup se dizin kiye gaye 42
 4 km is a part of the bridge
 bibisi kii reportke mutabik, yah pul chaar saal main 1
 55 billion dollars, or about 10,000 crore rupees
 haalanki, 10,000 karod kii laagat puure 42 kilometre lambey pul kii thi, na ki us vishesh hisse kii jo tasviir main dikh rahaa he
 We could not ascertain how much the part of the bridge seen in the picture would have cost
 bharat sarkaar ne gujarat main stachu of unity kaa nirmaan karaayaa he jisakilagatkareeb 3000 karod rupee he
 The cost of construction of the bridge of China which is being talked about in the picture is more than three times that of the Statue of Unity
 haalanki, yah bhi gaur karne kii baat he ki china bhi pratimaaon par baari bharkam raashi kharch karata he
 Before the inauguration of the Statue of Unity, the world's tallest statue was named after Caricord China

 garmiyon main keel, munhaase, fusiyaan, jhaaiyaan, tanning or rukhi bejaan twachaa se aamtaur par sabhi log pareshaan hote hai
 The main reason for this is - strong sun, hot winds and lifestyle
 ham kya khate hai, kya pite hai, kaise rahete hai, yah sab hamaare chehre par jhalkata he
 Do not drink the right amount of water, eat more junk food and ignore the cleanliness of the skin - all these things take away the beauty from the face
 jivan main kuch saral badlaav karke chehre par chamak or kanti kaayam rakh sakate hai
 Dr
 dermatologist of skincare clinics is telling about this
 bi
 L
 jangid-agar aap chaahate hai ki aapaki twachaa saaf or damakati hui dikhe, to aapako jeevanstyli or khaas taur par aapke khaane kii aadaton ko bhi vaisaa hi hona chahie
 By following these simple rules, you can maintain your skin health even in summer - befriend with water - Due to more temperature and more time outdoors, the amount of 'dehydration' in our body decreases
 isse na keval sirdard va chakkar aate hai, balki twachaa kii chamak bhi madhyam ho jaati he
 You should drink ten glasses of plain water daily
 yadi aap chaay yaa coffee jaise caffeine vaale peya pite hai to is se teen guna adhik maatra main aapako sada pani pinaa chahie
 Never sleep with makeup - Never sleep without makeup in summer
 iskaa paalan na karne kii vajah se twachaa kii upree sataha par gandagee kii ek parat si jamane lagati he
 This layer is actually the biggest cause of acne
 is se jhaaiyaan or 'pigmentation' yani twachaa kaa rang berang hone jaisi samasyaayein bhi hoti hai
 If you apply makeup, you must remove it before sleeping at night
 moischarise karnaa na bhoolen-twachaa ko moischarajd yaa nam rakhane kii ahmiyat ko nazarandaaj na karen
 The more dry and lifeless your skin is, it will not be able to withstand the damage done by the environment
 pradooshan or suraj kii tej kirnon kaa sabase bura asar sukhi twachaa par hi hota hai
 In this case, do not forget sunscreen too
 scrub kaa prayog na karen-apane chehre or sharir ko saaf rakhane ke liye saumy clinger kaa prayog karen
 Gel-based cleansers or shower gel are the best, but do not rub them too much
 is se twachaa kii upree parat ko nuksaan hota he
 Take skincare treatments - There are many facilities or treatments that not only keep the skin clean and clear but also help to keep the facial skin young and healthy
 parlor main janaa chahen to clin ap facial yaa cleriphing facial phydemand hai
 a dermatologist or dermatologist may have more medical facials
 carbon pil treetment-yah ek aisi prakriya he jis se phayda usee din dikhataa he or lambe samay tak iskaa asar aapke chehre par barkaraar rahata he
 This is a highly specialized treatment in which dermatologists or dermatologists first apply carbon to the skin
 uske baad ek bahut hi halkaa lager lagaaya jaataa he jis se yah carbon ke particals foot jate hai or twachaa kii upree parat kii safai karte hai
 In this process, all wrinkles, spots, scars, etc
 are erased and fine hairs on the face also bleach naturally

 UP CM Yogi Aditya Nathne has brought the city to the limelight once again by shortening the name of Faizabad to Ayodhya on short Diwali
 hindu santon kaa tark hua karata tha ki jahaan ram kaa janm hua us nagari kaa naam bhi agar ham nahin badal sake to hamen dhikkaar he
 The sage society was expecting a yogi which may not have been fulfilled, but one of his demands has been fulfilled
 faijabad se kai baar saansad rah chuke vinay katiyaar bhi faijabad kaa naam ayodhya karne kii maang kai baar kar chuke the
 Who named Faizabad, why this city became famous, when did we know its golden period
 ayodhya kisi jamaane main kausal rajya kii rajdhani thi
 According to the epic Ramayana, Rama was born here
 santon kaa kahana he ki dharm kii puraani kitabon main bhi is shahar kaa nakhyodhyaahi miltaa he or is tathy ko koi nakaar nahin saktaa
 But Faizabad has been a city which has been deteriorating, sometimes it has seen its climax and sometimes it has suffered neglect
 sarayu kaa kinaaraa or lakhanu se isaki najdiki ise hameshaa khaas banaati rahi he
 The Ram temple movement made Faizabad famous all over the world
 is shahar kii neenv us samay rakhi gai thi jab nawabon kaa shashan ubhaar par tha
 The city was founded by Nawab Alivardi Khan of Bengal, but the foundation of Faizabad was laid by the second Nawab Saadat Khan
 unke uttaradhikari sujauddula ne faijabad ko avadh kii rajdhani banaaya
 Growing from a small township - It is now included in the big cities of UP
 sainya mukhyalay banaanwab safadarajang ne 1739-54 main ise apana sainya mukhyalay banaaya
 After this, Shuja-ud-daulah built the fort in Faizabad
 yah vah daur tha jab yah shahar apni bulandiyon par tha
 Its distance from Lucknow was only 130 km, but it was called Chhota Kolkata because the Nawab had come through there and also used his style and color
 nawab shujauddula ke samay charmotkarsh parshujauddula kaa samay ek tarah se faijabad ke liye swarnakaal kaha ja saktaa he
 The prosperity that Faizabad achieved during that period could not be done again
 us daur main yahaan kai imaaraton kaa nirmaan hua jinaki nishaniyaan aaj bhi maujuud hai
 Shuja-ud-daula's wife Bahu Begum lived in Moti Mahal from where the view of the entire Faizabad was visible
 1775 main nawab asafauddaula ne apni rajdhani faijabad se badalakar lakhanu kar lee, iske baad yah apni rangath khone laga
 The Ram Mandir Movement brought the identity of the Ram Temple Movement to the world, putting Ayodhya on the table of the world
 ek samay aisa bhi aada ayodhya ke aage faijabad kaa naam simit ho gaya
 People of another state had to tell that Ayodhya is in Faizabad district
 sarkaar kisi kii bhi rahi ho ayodhya ke vikaas par bahut zyada dhyaan kisi ne nahin diya
 People say that the grand Ram temple was always talked about, but the grandeur of Ayodhya was never considered

 The systematic actions of the barbaric power-structure within the social hierarchy built on the caste system have come to the fore in recent times

 After all, why is it that being a Dalit becomes a bias of conspiracy and then creates resentment in others? Looking at the past few decades, almost all incidents of violence against Dalits suggest that this has happened when Dalits have shown some kind of equality with non-dalits
 iskaa matlab ki aisa hone par sadiyon puraani satta-sanrachana achaanak harakat main aa jaati he
 Dalits cannot demand equality in the matter of performing puja, in terms of remuneration, ownership of land or assets
 yahaan tak ki unke bachche gaiyr-daliton ke bacchon ke saath prem karne kaa sapana bhi nahin dekh sakate
 Even if a minor injury is felt to the non-dalit reputation, the easiest tool for revenge becomes the dignity of the Dalit woman
 shiksha, bazaar, kaam, swasthya seva or awaas ke kshetron main daliton ko bhedbhaav or sharmindagi kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 a study by the Indian Institute of Dalit Studies on marginalized groups confirms this negativity towards Dalits
 gaiyr-daliton main daliton ke liye ek vyavasthaagat nafrat bhari hui he
 She lies dormant within them and comes out bursting when she gets a chance

 This ancient system of reservation needs to be changed, before we adopt the affirmative action provided by the government

 chennai ke council for ledar exports (sieli) ke anusaar chamada udyog 25 lakh logon ke liye rojgaar paidaa karata he
 India is the fifth largest exporter of leather and net exports of leather and its products 6 in 2014-15
 5 arab dollar kaa hua tha
 At the last rung of this industry comes the traditional laborer who takes the skin off dead animals and manages the raw materials for this industry
 sawaal he ki gorakshak ek udyog ke kaamkaaj main adnga kyon daal rahe hai? ek aise majdoor kaa kaam kyon baadhit kar rahe hai jo mare hue pashu kii khaal utarkar use desh ke liye upyogi bana rahaa he? in logon ko agar vastav main pashuon se prem he, to inhen vyavsaayik dugdh utpaadak ikaayiyon main jaakar jinda pashuon kaa dard dekhnaa chahie, jahaan doodh nikaalane ke liye mashiinon kaa istemaal hota he
 What is the idea of our politicians, institutional officials and community members about this age old system which has hurt the conscience of right thinking people? Was it ever honestly considered with the intention to erase the difference between Dalits and non-dalits? Probably not
 hamaare netaa bhi usee samaaj se aate hai jo na sirf purvagrahon ke boj se dabaa hua he balki unhen sahi bhi tehraata he
 Therefore, instead of struggling with the problem, it has become more of an issue of provoking emotions according to need and time
 daliton ke kalyaan ke liye bani nitiyon or yojanaon ko aise lagu kiya jaataa he goyaa un par ehsaan kiya ja rahaa ho jabaki vastav main yah unka adhikaar he, jo dusron ko peedhishon se uttaradhikaar main miltaa aayaa he
 This especially applies to the equitable distribution of resources
 viraasat main mili inhen sansadhano se dusron ne apana ghar bhar liya he or daliton ko vanchit kar daalaa he
 You cannot reap the population benefits of your population until one-fifth of your youth is out of the process of development

 Many BJP leaders, including Tripura CM Biplab Deb, are often in the limelight with their peculiar statements
 ab is kadi menupicasiem yogiadityanath bhi shaamil ho gaye hai
 Yogi has advised farmers to grow Vegannakam, because people eat more sugar due to Kodiobiti
 yogi ne pashchimi upi ke bagpat main ek jansabha ke dauraan yah baat kahi
 According to the Times of India, he said in Baghpat on Tuesday, 'sow other crops too
 zyada ganna utpaadan se chini khapat zyada hoti he or isse logon ko diabetes jaisi beemaari ho jaati he
 In fact, Yogi Adityanath, along with Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari and Union Minister VK Singh, had arrived to lay the foundation stone of the four-lane road at Jat College, Barut in Baghpat
 diabetes hone kaa sidhaa sambandh chini se nahin he!gauratlab he ki doctor yah baat kehete rahe hai or kai research main bhi yah baat saamne ai he ki zyada chini khaane kaa diabetes hone se koi sambandh nahin he
 It occurs due to lack of insulin in the body
 haalanki yah sach he ki diabetes se peedit vyakti ko chini se bachane kii salaah di jaati he
 Experts say that people who consume more junk food or sweetened beverages and suffer from obesity, as well as their lifestyle is not healthy, they are more likely to get diabetes
 lekin diabetes hone kaa sidhaa sambandh chini yani sugar khaane se nahin he
 Addressing the public meeting, Yogi said, 'our government has paid Rs 36,000 crore for sugarcane farmers directly into the account
 baaki ke bache hue 10,000 karod rupee kaa bhugtan bhi jald kiya jayega
 Yogi said that soon the sugar mills will be given soft loan to overcome the losses

 He has been able to establish himself as a rival leader and the face of the opposition in this election and it is no small achievement if we look at the current state of the Congress party
 gujarat chunaav ke nateezon main bhale hi bhaajapa ko jeet mil jaae lekin pradhanmantri ke aarthik sudhaar ko ek kathin sandesh de paane main gujarat safal rahaa he
 Surely Narendra Modi will have to think again about his economic reforms because the risk he has seen in Gujarat, he would not like to repeat it in other states
 doosraa bada sandesh yah aa rahaa he ki gujarat ke jin hisson ko bhaajapa apana abhedya durg maanati thi, vahaan par send laga paane main congress safal rahi he or isse rajya main congress apni nai zamin taiyaar kar paane kii sthiti main or bhaajapa ko aane vaale chunaavon main takkar detii nazar aa sakati he
 For the BJP, it is a sweet pebble situation
 himachal pradesh ke live apadats jaanane ke lieyaha clic karenhimachal main khilaa kamalhimachal pradesh main bhi mukhyamantri virbhadra singh or purv mukhyamantri prem kumaar dhumal samet 337 ummidavaaron ke chunavi bhagya kaa faisla ho rahaa he
 The traditional rival BJP and Congress fielded candidates in all 68 seats in the state
 himachal main 75
 The turnout was 28 percent
 philhal virbhadra singh, unke bete vikramaditya singh, bhaajapa kii ore se mukhyamantri pad ke chehre prem kumaar dhumal aage chalate nazar aa rahe hai
 The election forecasts predicted the bjp's victory, which seems to be true
 bhaajapa rajya main spasht bahumat kii ore badhati nazar aa rahi he
 However, contrary to the assessment, the performance of the Congress has not been so bad and the prediction of their bad defeat in the state does not appear to be correct
 sahi sabit ho rahaa he ajtak kaa exit polgujrat or himachal pradesh vidhansabha chunaav par ajtak ke agsit pole main 'camel' khilne kaa anumaan lagaaya tha jo ki sahi sabit hota nazar aa rahaa he
 According to the exit poll of India today-axis My India, out of the total 182 seats in Gujarat, BJP can get 99 to 113 seats and Congress can get 68-82 seats
 anya ke khate main 1-4 siten jane kaa anumaan he
 BJP may get 47 per cent and Congress 42 per cent, 11 per cent votes can go to others
 rajya main pichley chunaav yani 2012 kii baat karen to gujarat vidhansabha main bijepi ko 115 siten mili thim, jabaki congress ko 61 siten mili thi
 The rest of the seats were shared by others

 On this statement of Srinivasan, TTV Dinakaran said, 'my aunt Sasikala could not meet Amma after October 1 and could not know her health
 dinakaran ne kaha ki yah mantri satta or paise ke liye apni baton se palat rahe hai
 "dinakaran's claim has shocked everyone, as senior party leader Valaramati said after October 1," Jayalalithaa is healthy and doing her government duties
 '' uske baad aspataal kii ore se bataaya gaya kijayalalita ko saanslene main takalif ho rahi he

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) After the overwhelming majority of the Bharatiya Janata Party's Social Engineering and Hindutva cards in the 2017 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, there were speculations that an OBC would be made the Chief Minister of the state
 lekin bijepi ne saansad yogi adityanath ko mukhyamantri banaakar sabhi ko chaunkaa diya
 The polarization of non-yadav OBC and Hindu votes forced each other's anti-socialist party and Bahujan Samaj Party to think that if they want to save their political credentials in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 yogi adityanath kii pahchaan hindutv ke prakhar netaa ke taur par puure soobe main he, jo aagaamee chunaav main bijepi ke kor vot ko sangathit rakhane ke lihaaj se nirnaayak sabit ho sakati he
 At the same time, BJP tried to satisfy all sections by appointing Brahmin Dinesh Sharma and OBC Keshav Prasad Maurya as deputy chief ministers
 bijepi ke samaane saath aae gaiyr-yadav obisi vot ko banaae rakhane kii chunauti bhi thi
 Therefore, in view of the Lok Sabha elections, BJP tried to help them by organizing different castes under the leadership of Keshav Prasad Maurya
 upi kii siyaasi jameen main yah ibaarat tab likhi ja rahi thi jab vidhansabha chunaav main soobe kii janata ko upi ke ladakon (rahul-akhilesh) kaa saath pasand nahin aayaa masalan congress-sapa gathbandhan ko janata ne nakaar diya tha
 Such a situation forced the two big opposition parties SP and BSP in UP to think about saving their political credentials
 lekin abhi is par aupchaarik muhar laganaa baaki thi
 The two Lok Sabha seats vacated with Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath and Phulpur MP Keshav Prasad Maurya becoming Chief Ministers and Deputy Chief Ministers gave these two parties a chance to experiment
 soobe main gorakhpur, phulpur or saansad hukum singh ke nidhan se khaali hui kairana loksabhaa seat par up-chunaav hue
 However, the BSP has a history of not showing interest in the by-elections
 lekin is baar kaa up-chunaav mayawati or akhilesh yadav ke liye saakh kii ladaai thi
 Because Akhilesh Yadav had failed miserably despite taking alliance with Congress in assembly elections after taking command of SP
 vahiin mayawati kii bispi kaa pradarshan bhi kuch khaas nahin rahaa
 In such a situation, the BSP, which never contested the by-election, supported the candidates of the coalition as an experiment
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki bijepi uttar pradesh kii teenon siton par haar gai or desh main is tarah kaa maahaul bana ki bijepi ajey nahin he
 According to experts, the victory of the sp-bsp-rashtriya Lok Dal coalition in the by-election played an important role in laying the foundation of the opposition alliance
 or aaj kii taarikh main sapa-basapa-ralod gathbandhan soobe main gathbandhan ke saath bijepi ko chunauti dene ke liye taiyaar khadey dikh rahe hai
 Therefore, it is clear that along with the aggressive nationalist politics of the BJP, the social engineering formula had no option but to come together with the big opposition parties
 kyonki sapa-basapa ne pehle 2014 or phir 2017 main ek duusare ke khilaaf chunaav ladakar dekh liya tha ki agar uttar pradesh main apni siyaasi daal galani he to unhen gathbandhan kii khichdi pakaani hi hogi
