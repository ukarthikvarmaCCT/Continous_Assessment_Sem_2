 He said that MTNL has planned to install around 6,000 cameras at 1,800 locations in Mumbai under the Police City Surveillance Scheme

 At the same time some students also climbed over the barricade

 In such a situation, they ask to question the police
 vakt aa gaya he lanka daure ke yaadgaar anjaam kaa or iske liye bharat ko colombo main mangalvaar ko honevaala twanti-20 muqabla jeetna hi hoga
 India and Sri Lanka will face each other in this format for the first time
 matlab aankadon ke aaine main koi kisi par baari nahin
 Team India is the emperor of this most exciting format of cricket
 dedh saal pehle duniya ne khub dekhi he team india kii takat
 This team won the first Twenty20 match in South Africa
 is team ne pehali twanti-20 world championships jiti or is team ke khilaadiyon ne ipel main dhooma machaai
 Team India has an amazing balance
 aate hi gendbaajon kii dhajjiyaan udaane ke liye sahvaag hai or duusare chor par gautam gambhir
 For some reason, even if the opener returned quickly, then there is no reason to panic
 dhooma machaane ke liye leader mahendra singh dhoni ke alaava yusuf pathan jaise heater bhi hardam taiyaar rahete hai dressing room main
 Who can forget this emperor of Sixer, Yuvraj Singh
 koun bhul saktaa he stuart broad kii chah gend par lage chah chhakkon ko, koun bhul saktaa he unke balle kii bhukh ko
 Even if the Sri Lankan bowler has forgotten, it is certain that Yuvraj will not take much time to sharpen the memory of the front
 40 saal ke buudhe yaa 40 saal ke jawan, baat twanti-20 kii ho to sanat jayasoorya jaraa anfit najar aate hai
 Of course, at this age Jayasuriya keeps showing his pace, but playing 40 overs is not at all for a 40-year-old player
 or gajab dekhie, lanka apane jang khaae isi hathiyaar par bharosa kiye baitha he
 Sri Lanka captain changed to Twenty20
 mahela jayavardhane or sangakaara jaise ballebaajon ko aaraam mil gaya lekin team ho gai puri tarah nausikhia
 All of them know that Lanka has a Twenty20 experience
 upar se em factor bhi he baahar
 Even though India and Lanka have not met each other in the Twenty20, most players have understood each other by playing together in the IPL and the strength and weakness of the teams around the world is well known
 aise main ahm hoga ki world champion bharat is mukaable main kaise apana rutaba kaayam rakhata he
 Sri Lankan cheetahs have also returned to life after winning the last one-day
 vaise bhi is formet main kisi ko kam karke aankna thik nahin or jab duusari team main sanath jayasoorya hon to khatra kuch bad jaataa he
 This is the player who can turn the dice of this match whenever he wants
 tii-20 team ke nae captain dilashaan bhi dikhaa chuke hai balle kaa dam or sabit kar chuke hai ki ham bhi nahin kam
 But the special thing is that the names that are missing from this team are the identity of this team
 naa mahela, naa murali, naa sangakara, or naa hi mendis
 By the way, there is neither a shortage of allrounder nor enthusiasm in the team
 bas kami he to us taj kii jo team india ke sir sajaa he
 That is, the king will have to hunt the cheetah, then the king will remain intact
 van-de main pitane ke baad srilanka ne twanti-20 kii kaman saunpi tillakaratne dilashaan ko
 Dilshan will also be under pressure with responsibility in this only match
 lekin captain ke taur par apana debyue kar rahe dilashaan is zimmedaari se utsahit hai

 Priyanka Gandhi may camp in Varanasi from next week to intensify this wind
 ye baat us vakt saamne ai, jab beete guuruuvaar ko priyanka gandhi video colling ke jariye banaras ke kaaryakartaaon or pratyaashee ajay raay se rubaru huin
 Not only did Priyanka Gandhi know the condition of the Congress in the area with the activists, she also encouraged the activists that each of the workers will have to work hard by going to their booth level
 kaaryakartaaon ne jab unke apane program ke bare main jaananaa chaha to unhone bharosa diya ki wo jitne din chahenge yahaan camp karengi
 It has been Priyanka Gandhi's staunch strategy that she also talks to the workers and she gives the credit to the activists for doing what she wants to do, calling on the workers and acting on their wishes
 isi kadi main wo khud purvanchal kii baaki bachi 13 siton ko mathne ke liye banaras main camp karnaa chaahati hongi magar use kahalwaya kaaryakartaaon ke mukh se
 It is worth noting that Uttar Pradesh has 13 seats including Benaras in the last phase elections, since the Prime Minister himself is contesting from Banaras, it will have an impact on these 13 seats as well
 isliye priyanka gandhi bhi in 13 siton par apana prabhaav kaabiz karne ke liye banaras main camp karne kii taiyaari main hai
 These 13 seats of Purvanchal fall in 10 districts of Purvanchal
 ye jile hai varanasi, sonbhadra, baliya, gajipur, mau azamgarh, mirzapur, jonpur, bhadohi or chandauli
 It has two sides each in three districts Jaunpur, Ballia and Azamgarh, such as Machilishahar, Salempur and Lalganj
 in 13 siton main 2014 main azamgarh ko chhod kar baaki kii 12 siton par bijepi kaa kabza tha, lekin is baar in siton par 2014 ke halaat nahin hai
 While the SP-BSP alliance is giving a tough fight to the BJP, the Congress candidates are hurting the BJP in many seats
 aise main priyanka gandhi yahaan agar camp karke in ilaakon main saghan daura karti hai, to bijepi ke liye or badi mushkil khadi kar dengi
 Anyway, for Priyanka, making Congress penetration in these areas is also a challenge for her as she is also in charge of Purvanchal in this election

 It was also written that the woman living near the hostel, Yamini, who is the wife of sports college athletics coach Siddharth Krishna, had accused her that she was unnecessarily blaming him in some case, due to this, she was upset

 According to the Children's Commission team, Saifai District Magistrate JB Singh and Jail Superintendent Rajkishore Singh greatly cooperated in the case
 bal ayog kii team ne paaya ki is maamle main abhi thik se jaanch kii jarurat he, kyonki jaanch ke dauraan kai pahaluon ko chhod diya gaya he
 As the father of the dying girl Saloni alleges that the police did not gather complete evidence in this case, because Saloni had a habit of writing a diary and the police had not yet seized any diary from his room in his investigation
 jaanch main laaparvaahivahin, maukey se mili hue sabooton ke aadhaar par suicide note kii riting kaa police abhi tak milan nahin kar pai, kyonki college prashasan kii taraf se abhi tak saloni kii handriting kii copy police ko nahin di gai
 Apart from this, the police have not yet questioned Siddharth Krishna, husband of woman Yamini, accused in this case and coach of athletics at Sports College
 is maamle main bataaya yah bhi ja rahaa he ki saloni kii baatcheet kisi ladke se hoti thi
 The police has not yet conducted such a search
 saath hi uske kamare main rahane vaali baaki do ladakiyon ko is ghatana ke bare main kuch bhi pataa nahin chalaa
 Apart from this, counseling of those girls has not been done so that they can tell the whole thing

 Jaya Singh interrogated the woman accused in the case, Yamini, in the district jail and also tried to find out her side
 yamini ke mutabik, wo ladakiyon ko sirf galat sahi ke bare main rokatii-tokati thi, baaki saloni se unka kisi tarah kaa koi bhi vivaad nahin tha
 The team also took stock of the opportunity and tried to understand the facts based on the information given by the police
 baad main is maamle main gambhirtha or gaharaai se jaanch kaa nirdesh dete hue bal ayog kii jaya singh apni taraf se ek vistrut report taiyaar kar rahi hai, jo forensik report aane va police dwaara chute hue bayaan or jaanch puri hone ke baad shashan ko bheji jaaegi

 According to the information, the matter of killing has not been revealed in this case yet

 darasal, worldcup kii bhartiya team main rayudu ke daawey ko nakaarte hue harfanmaulaa vijay shankar ko chunaa gaya tha
 MSK Prasad, then head of the Selection Committee, defended the selection of Vijay Shankar
 prasad ne kaha tha ki vijay shankar team ko 'thri-diemension' pradaan karenge
 Prasad was meant to balance the team in batting, bowling and fielding
 rayudu kahaan chup rahete
 He tweeted a tweet taunting the chief selector, 'has ordered a new set of 3-D glasses to watch the world cup
 ' worldcup ke dauraan hi rayudu ne international cricket se sanyas lene kii ghoshnaa karke ek or dhamaakaa kiya tha, haalanki baad me you-turn lete hue ve cricket main waapas laut aae the

 There is a tug of war between India and Pakistan
 pakistan ke samarthan vaale aatankiyon ne pulavama (pulwama attack)main siarpief ke kafile par hamalaa karke do darjan se adhik bhartiya javaanon ko kaayartapurna hamale kaa shikaar banaaya tha
 There was an atmosphere of anger across the country regarding this attack
 bharat ne jawaab dene main der nahin lagaai or air strike (air Strike) karke pakistan main sthit aatanki thikaane tabah kar die
 Many terrorists were also killed in this attack
 bharat ke is air strike par purv cricketer virendra sahvaag (virender Sehwag)ke twit ko logon ne khub pasand kiya
 In his tweet, Veeru had written in the same language - Boy's Play Really Well
 iske saath hi hashtag tha-sudhar jaao varanaa sudhaar lenge
 The boys have played really well
 # sudharjaaowarnasudhaardenge # airstrikepakiswana ke mantri bharat par nishaanaa saadhane kaa koi mauka nahin chookte
 Sri Lanka's top 10 players withdrew from their tour of Pakistan for security reasons
 pakistan kii imran khan sarkaar ke mantri fawaad choudhary (fawad Chaudhry)ko isamen bhi bharat ko haath najar aayaa
 With his tweet, he became the laughingstock of everyone
 fawaad choudhary ne apane twit main likhaa, 'camentators se mujhe bataaya ki bharat ne srilankai khilaadiyon ko dhamkee di he ki agar unhone pakistan daure se inkaar nahin kiya to unhen IPL se baahar kar diya jayega
 This is a really inexpensive strategy
 fawaad kaa maananaa tha ki bharat kii dhamkee ke kaaran hi srilanka ke pramukh players ne pakistan ke daure se naam waapas liya he
 They have forgotten that no one in their country feels safe
 baad main srilanka ke mantri ne fawaad ke bayaan kaa khandan karke isaki hawa puri tarah nikaal di
 Informed sports commentators told me that India threatened SL players that they would be ousted from IPL if they don't refuse Pak visit, this is really cheap tactic, jingoism from sports to space is something we must condemn, really cheap on the part of Indian Sports authorities The uncertainty over the Devis Cup match between the two countries persisted for a long time amidst tensions in relations between India and Pakistan

 Nelson Mandela: As the name of Babacamandela emerges, many images of her emerge in mind
 27 saal jail main bitaane ke baad bhi yah shaks tuutata nahin he
 To change his society and country, he is ready to take all the steps
 kaid se ajaad hokar mukti kaa jabardast yoddha sulah-samajhaite kaa samarthak ho jaataa he
 After forming a party, as the President, he gets involved in the establishment of democratic values within the country, designing the development
 raashtrapati ke pad se mukt hone ke baad bhi sabko samaan avasar dene kii apni ladaai jari rakhata he
 In the midst of all this, the second picture of the life of Mandela, always seen in garish clothes, is revealed, in which he divorces his second wife at the age of 78, and forms a third marriage after two years
 nelson mandela ek insaan ke taur par kaise the, ve kin-kin baton se prabhavit hote the, unka jivan kin chizon se chamatkrit hota or kab unki samvednaaon ke taar jhkrut hote hai, kya unka dil parivaar ke liye ku chha karne ko nahin tadapata? kya ve yaari-dosti ke liye vakt nahin nikaalnaa chaahate the
 In this book, Mandela himself is answering these questions
 darasal, apane jivan or siyaasi ladaai ko vishay banaate hue mandela ne aatmakatha long walk tu freedom ke naam se likhi thi

" aam aadamiyon kii tarah unamem bhi kamiyaan raheen lekin unki kamiyaan hi hai jo hamen prerit karti hai
 "this book presents Mandela's real character in an interesting way, apart from his public image
" ek adhyay main ve bataate hai ki ''jab bhi main apane puraane lekh or bhaashanon ko dekhtaa hum to laffaaji, banaavatipan or moulikta kii kami se chakit rah jaataa hum
 In those speeches, the feeling of influencing others and advertising yourself is palpable
 '' khud ke prati isse zyada eemaandaar aalochana or kya ho sakati he
 The book also contains letters that Mandela has written from time to time to first wife Evelyn, second wife Winnie, and sons and daughters
 inamen mandela kii, parivaar ke liye kuch bhi khaas na kar paane kii bechaini mukhar hokar saamne aati he
 Reading Mandela's letters is nothing short of understanding ways to improve life

 har baar unki mehnat bekaar gai
 Let me tell you that when his daughter was very young, she had to forcibly adopt her child to someone else
 england kii rahane vaali 41 saal kii sara ko apni bacchee kaa pehla naam to pataa tha, lekin sarnem yani ki kulanaam kii koi jaankaree nahin thi
 She did not know who adopted her daughter
 aise main bacchee ko dhundhna unke liye aasaan nahin tha
 In November last year, Sara thought of finding her daughter on Facebook
 unhone fasebuk ke search baar par apni beti kaa naam tip kiya "keleg maari"
 Then what was this, hundreds of profiles of this name came in front of their eyes
 haalanki itane saare profiles main se apni beti ko dhundhna naammumkin kaam tha, lekin sara ne haar nahin maani
 He started looking at all the profiles named Keleg Mari
 tabhi unki najar ek aise profile par padi jisaki tasviir unki javaani ke dinon se milti-julati thi
 Sara felt that Keleg Marie Watts may be the same daughter whom he adopted 19 years ago
 unhone use friend request bheji or paanch minute ke andar-andar fasebuk par ek-duusare ko massej kar donon ne bataaya ki ki ve aapas main kaaphi milte-julate hai
 Sarah tells Keleg that her name was Keleg Marie Thomas when her daughter was adopted
 iske baad keleg ne massej kar jawaab diya, 'maa'
 The two talked through messages for about five months
 ek hafte pehle hi sara or keleg kii mulaakaat hui or tab se ve ek-duusare ke saath hi hai
 The two celebrated Mother's Day together on Saturday for the first time since 1995
 sara behad khush hai or kahati hai, 'main pichley saat saalon se keleg ko dhund rahi hum, lekin jinhone use god liya tha main un logon kaa sarnem nahin jaanati thi
 Then i started searching on Facebook just by writing Keleg Mari '
 sara ke mutabik, 'jab maine keleg kii tasviir dekhi to vah meri parchaai jaisi thi
 When she came in front of me, i hugged her so hard that her neck was about to break
 mujhe yakeen nahin ho rahaa he ki aakhirkaar maine use dhund hi liya'
 At the same time, Keleg says, 'this is excellent
 aisa laga rahaa he maano ham kabhi juda hi na hue hon
 i started researching the mother who gave birth to me three months ago
 mujhe hameshaa se pataa tha ki ham ek na ek din jarur milenge, lekin mujhe ye nahin pataa tha ki yah sab itnaa jaldi ho jayega'
 In fact, Sarah had to adopt her daughter because her relationship with the girl's father was not good
 aise main samaaj sevakon ko dar tha ki ghar ke maahaul kaa nanhee bacchee par kharaab asar padegaa isliye unhone keleg ko kisi duusare ko god de diya
 Now after meeting her mother after so many years, Keleg says, 'I have found my mother
 ham donon ek duusare se bahut zyada milte-julate hai'
 At the same time, Sara says, 'I am on the seventh sky after getting my daughter back'
 udhar, keleg ko god lene vaale maa-baanp ne apana bayaan dene se inkaar kar diya he

 nagpur kii pich ko kharaab bataane vaali antarrashtriya cricket parishad (isisi) kii report par team india ke test captain viraat kohli ne hairaani jataate hue is par nishaanaa bhi saadhaa

" ’bharat nenagpur main tisare test main 124 ran kii jitake saath chaar maichon kii siries main 2-0 kii vijayi badhat bana lee he
 The match went on for two and a half days after which the ICC Match Referee Jeff Crowe in his report did not declare the pitch suitable for international cricket
 bisisiai ko 14 din ke bheetar jawaab dene ko kaha gaya he
 Kohli's attack on the media also targeted the reports coming in the media regarding the pitches
 kohli ne media main aa rahi report par palatwaar karte hue kaha, ‘dakshin africa main ek pari main teen baar 50 ran se kam ke score bane lekin maine par is kisi tarah kaa lekh nahin dekha
 Six times in South Africa, the teams were dismissed for less than 100 runs
 is par kabhi koi lekh nahin dekha
 See, we are meant to write articles
 yah maansikta yaa kisi kaa najariya he
 i do not pay attention to it
 mujhe yaa team ko isse koi fark nahin padataa
 'he said,' People can write with their point of view as they wish
 hamen jo karnaa chahie vah ham sarvshereshth tareeke se kar rahe hai
 Kohli maintained his aggressive stance even when a journalist repeated that it was an official ICC report
 bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘haa, main (isisi samet) sabhi ke bare main bol rahaa hum
 I'm not just talking about those who write articles
 durbhaagya se hamaare desh kii paristhitiyon ko kaaphi adhik badha chadhaakar pesh kiya jaataa he or yah tathy he
 Because we only talk about the pitch and when we are in South Africa, we only talk about how poorly we played

 We are changing our mindset but the people around us are not changing
 hamaari takanic ke liye hamaari aalochana kii jaati he lekin jab mehmaan team acha nahin khelti to hameshaa pichon ke bare main baat hoti he
 Asked about Kotla's pitch, Kohli said, "I don't want to say too much about the pitch because a lot has been said about it
" behatar hoga ki agar ham sakaaratmak pakshon kii baat karen
 Because when the team wins, you should get support from everywhere
 ham hameshaa logon kii aalochana ke liye bindu dhundte hai lekin hamen logon ko aatmavishvaas dena chahie
 That's why it doesn't seem logical to us that everyone is talking about the pitch
 ’edilade main ‘gulabi gend’ se khele gaye test kaa bhi kohli ne zikr karte hue kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki kisi ne bhi edilade test ke bare main lekh nahin likhaa jo dhai din main khatm ho gaya
 So i don't see anything wrong with our pitches

 !!!A post shared by Milind Usha Soman (@milindrunning) on Jan 3, 2018 at 2:29am PSTA post shared by Earthy_5 (@earthy_5) on Dec 17, 2017 at 7:27pm PST Sheila Dixit says that Sonia Gandhi does not run away from responsibility and she gets to mix easily with all the leaders
 ab iskaa matlab kya he? jo baat shila dikshit ne nahin kii vah he ki rahul gandhi bhagode hai, yani rahul ko do maheene kii chuttee par jane ke bajaae sansad ke bajet satr main maujuud rahanaa chahie tha or bhoomi adhigrahan bill par sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha kholana chahie tha
 Not only this, farmers should have been involved in the misery and pain of the crops that have been ruined at this time
 shila dikshit ne baat to thik kii he, rahul gandhi apni party ke netaaon ke saath sahajata se ghul mil nahin pate
 Sheila Dixit will have this experience or other Congress leaders
 magar itnaa to tay he ki badi peedi ke kai netaa chaahe vah hansraj bharadwaj hon yaa captain amarinder singh, rahul ko or vakt die jane kii baat kar rahe hai
 It is also to be seen here that these leaders have either played their political innings or are in the final political phase
 in sab ko lagata he ki kahin rahul ke aane ke baad unki koi bhi puch nahin hogi
 There can be many reasons for these leaders to speak against Rahul, Captain Amarinder in Punjab is angry with state president Pratap Singh Bajwa, then Sheila Dixit's displeasure is natural to give the command of the party in Delhi to Ajay Maken, probably because Sheela Dixit would think that Maken would not give any place in the party for Sandeep Dixit
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki sandip dikshit bhi sonia gandhi ke paksh main bayaan de chuke hai
 As for Hansraj Bhardwaj, now he should retire
 gandhi parivaar ne unhen kaaphi kuch diya
 Sent to Rajya Sabha five times, made minister at center and then governor
 rahul kaa chuttee par jane ke peeche bhi yahi kaaran he ki vah congress ko apane dhang se chalaanaa chaahate hai or apni team bananaa chaahate hai
 The problem is here because those who are currently taking decisions in the party are seeing their chair in danger
 unako yah nahin pataa ki team rahul main unki jagah hogi yaa nahin
 Sonia Gandhi's way of working is different, she has trusted the people of Rajiv Gandhi's team and respects those who have been associated for a long time and does not ignore them
 duusare pradhanmantri pad ko thukraa dene kii vajah se unka raajnneetik kad rahul ke mukaable kaaphi bada he
 At the same time Rahul has poisoned the power in Jaipur's Chintan Camp, due to which his image is made of some leader who may be in compulsion in politics
 phir unke mark shit main bhi achche rigelt nahin hai
 This is the reason why Rahul does not instill confidence in himself
 khayr yah bataaya ja rahaa he ki rahul ek do din main aane vaale hai or 19 april ko dilli main congress dwaara yojit raily main hissaa lenge
 But it is certain that the time of Rahul's coronation has been postponed
 pehle yah isi maheene hona tha, magar ab is saal ke ant tak hoga
 However, the date for the internal election of the Congress organization has been announced at the behest of Rahul
 yah ek acchhee shuruyaat he
 Rahul's impression is also seen in the appointment of new party spokespersons and the appointment of some state presidents
 congress main rahul ko lekar jo bechaini dikh rahi he, vah jitna jaldi khatm hoga party ke liye utana hi acha hoga or sonia gandhi kii bhoomika kaa bhi sabko intjaar rahegaa
 Rajasthan Public Service Commission can release the result of Rajasthan Administrative Service Examination 2012 in the next two days

 In an official statement issued by Viacom 18 Motion Pictures, it said that the film Padmavati, which is going to release on December 1, 2017, has been postponed
 jaane kya kaha gaya he bayaan main:vycom 18 moshan pikchars kii ore se jari is bayaan main kaha gaya he, 'padmavati' ko banane ke peeche jis studio ne kaam kiya he vah swechha se 1 disambar 2017 ko hone vaali film relies ko sthagit karata he
 Viacom 18 Motion Pictures, along with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, one of the most talented filmmakers, has created a beautiful cinematic masterpiece, 'padmavati'
 jisamen rajput veerta, garima or parampara ko filmaaya gaya he
 This film is a story that will fill all Indians with pride and demonstrate the skill of telling the story of our country around the world
 'ham ek jimmedaar, kanoon-paalan karne vaale korporate naagarik hai or apane desh ke kanoon or sansthaanon jinamein sensor board bhi shaamil he ke liye hamaare dil main ucchtam sammaan he
 We are committed to always following the established process and convention
 hamen vishwaas he ki ham jaldi hi film ko relies karne ke liye apekshit manjuuri or jald badali hui relies taarikh kii ghoshnaa karenge
 Was the decision taken after Prasoon Joshi's objection, Prasun Joshi told India Today about the private screening, 'the censor board has not seen the film yet and neither has the film been certified
 aise main mekars dwaara privet screening karnaa or neshnal channelon par film kii samiksha karnaa behad niraashajanak he
 This is like an agreement against the process of the system
 ek taraf film kii relies prakriya main teji laane ke liye sensor board par dawaab daalaa ja rahaa he or duusari taraf sensor ke process ko hi nasht karne kaa prayaas ho rahaa he
 'it is like setting an opportunistic example,' said Prasoon Joshi
 ' ab film ko sthagit kiye jane ke baad ye sawaal khadaa ho rahaa he ki kya sensor board ke etraj ke baad hi mekars ne film ko sthagit karne kaa faisla kiya he?padmavati ko lekar chal rahe vivaad badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya has said that the film will not be released in Uttar Pradesh until the disputed parts are removed from the film
 iske pehle shanivaar ko rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara ne soochna or prasaaran mantri smriti irani ko chitthee likh kaha he ki film main jab tak jaruri badlaav naa ho, tab tak ise relies naa kiya jaae
 He has said that a committee of famous historians, members of film personalities, should discuss the film's story in detail
 kya jhooth bol rahe hai padmavati ke nirmaataa? sensor ne waapas kar di he filmraaje ne sensor board ko certificate dene se pehle sabhi parinaamon ke bare main soch lene ke liye kaha he
 In Indore, Union Minister Thanwar Singh Gehlot has asked the censor board to remove objectionable scenes from the film
 raaje ne chitthee main likhaa he ki filmmekars ke paas apni sujh-boojh ke hisaab se filmein banane kaa adhikaar he, lekin samvidhan main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki kanoon- vyavastha or nagarikon kii bhaawanaaon kii raksha ke liye moulik adhikaron ko control karnaa hoga
 Hence the film's release should be rethought
 jab chitthee likhane kii baat saamne ai tab ek mewar pratinidhi mandal ne raaje se mulaakaat kii
 Two days ago, Uttar Pradesh government asked Smriti Irani to postpone the release of the film
 unka kahana he ki script or tod-marod kar pesh kiye gaye aitihaasik tathyon par logon kaa gussa foot saktaa he or isse nyaay-vyavastha par asar pad saktaa he
 Did Padmavati release postponed? Not only for Jeet Karni Sena but for the benefit of Shabana Azmi only in support of Bhanshalifilm: However, actress Shabana Azmi appeared in support of the film
 unhone shuukravaar ko twit kar kaha- puri film industry ko padmavati ko mil rahi dhamkiyon ke virodh main IFFI kaa bahishkaar karnaa chahie

 Sabki dukaan chal rahi hai under the patronage not of the fringe but of the Govt in power
 Filmindustry must stand as 1 with # Padmavati — Azmi Shabana (@azmishabana) November 17, 2017 Confusion over the film's release date There is confusion over the proposed release date of Leela Bhansali's film Padmavati
 shuukravaar ko india today ko sutron ne bataaya ki film 12 janvari ke din relies hogi
 It was earlier to be released on 1 December
 haalanki padmavati ke mekars ne date aage badhane kii khabaron se inkaar kiya he
 Ajit Andhare, COO of Viacom18, one of the producers of the film, called the news of Padmavati's release TED slipping forward baseless
 keval virodh hi nahin, in vajahon se bhi tal sakati he padmavati kii relies?document main khamiyanwaise film ke nirmaataaon kii ore se sensor board ko jo document bheje gaye the usamen kai tarah kii khamiyaan hai
 The release of the film is proposed nationwide on December 1 by the makers
 sutron ne india today ko bataaya ki mekars kii ore se 17 november sensor board ko copy saunpi gai he
 Sources told India Today, 'the original documents sent by the Padmavati Makers to the censors are incomplete
 film kii shuruyaat main bhi apekshit disclemur nahin he
 Certification of the film has been delayed due to lack of documentation
 'film ke talane kii ye ho sakati hai 2 badi vajahen # 1
 What is the rule of the censor board: Actually, according to the rules, a film has to be sent to the censor 15 days before the release for certification
 film kii pehali copy kaa kaam puraa nahin hua tha
 Because of this it was not sent to the sensor
 film 17 november ko hi sensor ke paas bheji gai he
 The proposed date of sending the film to the board for release on December 1 has expired
 sensor ne niyam kaa paalan kiya to 1 disambar ko film kii relies par sankat he
 # 2
 film par jari vivaad : haalanki yah saaf nahin he lekin film par jari vivaad bhi relies date kii talane kii ek vajah ban sakate hai
 Political parties like Karni Sena and congress-bjp have raised objections to the film
 gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav or upi main nikaay chunaav ke maddenjar bijepi ne ise taalane kii maang kii gai thi
 The BJP had written a letter to the Election Commission demanding extension of the date
 sensor kaa maamla bataate hue ayog ne ise asweekaar kar diya tha
 Release date slips, so what next? # 1
 film ko lekar jari gatirodh kuch dinon ke liye kam hoga
 If the film is released after the Gujarat and UP civic elections, then the political parties may not have to face opposition
 # 2
 The movement under the leadership of Karni Sena and other Rajput organizations will weaken
 chunki film kii relies taarikh tal rahi he shaayad janvari main main isaki relies shanti se ho sake
 Is there no intervention of the government? On the other hand, sources made it clear to India Today that there is no interference from the government in the functioning of CBFC regarding Padmavati
 film ke baar main koi faisla lene ke liye sensor board swatantra he
 There is no government intervention in the functioning of the sensor
 sensor chif ne nahin dekhi he filmasensor board chif prasoon joshi ne india today ko bataaya ki unhone abhi tak padmavati nahin dekhi he
 Such reports are lies, in which a private screening is being said to watch the film
 soochna or prasaaran mantri smriti irani ke najdiki sutron ne bhi kaha, kendriya mantri ne bhi aise kisi screening event main film nahin dekhi he
 Such discussions are unfounded
 relies se pehle karani sena ko dikhaanaa chaahate hai filmasensor board sutron ne yah bhi bataaya ki mekars ne karani sena ko relies se pehle film dikhaane ke liye sensor board se anumati maangi he
 For this, a special screening letter has been written to the Censor Board on behalf of the makers of Padmavati

 After the debacle in the Lok Sabha elections, the churn continues in the Congress
 kabhi party ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke ishaaron par chalane vaali congress party ab waapas varisht netaaon or party kii jamini raajnneeti samajhane vaale netaaon ko tarjeeh dene kii vakaalat kar rahi he or unki salaah par party main sudhaar karne kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 It is being said that the road map that Rahul Gandhi had prepared for the party during the election has been rejected
 jaankaree ke mutabik party ke netaa digvijay singh ne congress ke kai anya varishton se baatcheet kar jo report taiyaar kii he usamen rahul gandhi ke NSUI or youth congress ke formule ko khaarij kar diya gaya he
 In the report submitted to Congress President Sonia Gandhi, the inaction of the frontal organization has been considered as the biggest reason for the defeat
 yuvaaon kii congress se duuri bhi ek vajah bataai gai he
 At the same time, the process of holding elections in the Youth Congress and NSUI on the lines of the American delegate has also been attributed
 yani rahul gandhi ke formule ne congress ke us mizaaj kaa hi bantaadhaar kar diya jiske hisaab se har yuva congress se judakar khud kaa kad bada maanata tha
 It is the effort of the party that now the focus of Rahul Gandhi should be on the party and not on the Youth Congress, NSUI or Mahila Congress

 He said that no electoral face was presented by his party against the Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan of Madhya Pradesh's KJP government, part of the Congress strategy
 chuninda sampadakon or patrakaron se anaupchaarik baatcheet main yahaan rahul se poocha gaya tha ki congress ne rajya main 28 november ko hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main shivaraj ke khilaaf mukhyamantri pad kaa koi daavedaar ghoshit kyon nahin kiya? is par congress adhyaksh ne jawaab diya, "ham madhyapradesh kii tarah rajasthan main bhi isi ranneeti (vidhansabha chunaavon main mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar ghoshit nahin karnaa) kaa istemaal kar rahe hai

 Kamal Nath has vast political experience, while Scindia is a young and energetic leader

 com / yy0evm5nl2 — MP Congress (@INCMP) October 30, 2018 In this assembly election, the challenge is facing the ruling BJP to win for the fourth consecutive time in Madhya Pradesh, while the Congress is trying to end the last 15 years of exile from state power
 is
 congress main gutbaji ke aarope lagaate hue bijepi apane jari chunaav prachaar main baraabar yah daawa kar rahi he ki soobe ke pramukh vipakshi dal ke paas aisa koi damdaar netaa nahin he, jo mukhyamantri pad kii jang main shivaraj ke khilaaf thahar sake
 Before the Karnataka results, the Congress has started the barricade
 goa or manipur ke chunaavon se sabak lete hue is baar congress ne apana plan b bhi taiyaar kar liya he
 According to the information, in the internal survey of the Congress, the party seems to get 111 seats in Karnataka
 is sanket ke fouran baad party haikaman ne do senior netaonshok gahalotaur gulam nabi aaazaad ko bengalooru bhej diya he
 Five secretaries, including Karnataka in-charge KC Venugopal, have also been posted by the Congress in the state
 in sabhi netaaon ko karnataka main pal-pal badal rahe siyaasi samikarnon ko samajhane ke liye pehle hi ravaanaa kar diya gaya he
 It is believed that the Congress can also play the card of the Dalit CM to bring the JDS closer
 is baar karnataka kii ladaai thodi hatakar he
 a collision of thorn like Gujarat is also here
 yahaan oont kis karavat baithegaa, abhi koi nahin kah saktaa
 The exit poll is also not clear
 isliye nattejey ke baad kaa jod-ghataana-guna-bhaag abhi se chal rahaa he
 Even a staunch politician like Siddaramaiah should talk about supporting the Dalit CM before the results, then it should be understood that this time the matter is complicated
 india today group-axis MY INDIA ke survey main haalanki congress sabase badi party ke rup main ubhar kar ai he
 According to the Exit Poll, the Congress is expected to get 106 to 118 seats in Karnataka
 vahiin, bijepi ko 79 se 92 seat milane kaa anumaan he
 Apart from this, JDS seems to get 22 to 30 seats
 chunaav main congress kaa vot share 39 fisadi, jabaki bijepi ko 35 fisadi vot milane kaa anumaan he
 Whatever may be the result of Karnataka, its echo will be heard in the politics of the country till the Lok Sabha elections next year
 agar karnataka main congress ko purna bahumat miltaa he to ye ‘grand old party’ ke liye sanjivani booti haath lagane se kam nahin hoga
 If the Congress retains the fort of Karnataka for a second consecutive time, then it will increase the enthusiasm of the party workers across the country
 iskaa sidhaa matlab hoga is saal ke aakhir main madhya pradesh or rajasthan main hone vaale chunaav main bijepi kaa sirdard badhegaa

 How to control blood sugar or diabetes with garlic? Advantages and disadvantages of garlic parichaalan ke 20 baras puure kar chukaa desh kaa sheersh exange neshnal stock exange (enesai) hameshaa yuva rahanaa chahta he
 NSE chief Chitra Ramakrishna said that through this experience, we want to take the exchange on the path of top exchanges globally
 ramakrishna ne enesai kii 20 saal kii yatra kaa zikr karte hue kaha, dil se ham hameshaa yuva or urjavan rahanaa chaahate hai
 Actually we are in adolescence right now
 enesai ne 1994 main parichaalan shuru kiya tha or ek saal ke bheetar hi isane bombai share bazaar ko peeche chhod diya or yah desh kaa sabase bada share bazaar ban gaya
 NSE has brought a new generation of technology to the trading business with several innovations in India
 ise hameshaa yuva exange kaha jaataa he, kyonki uskaa pratidwandvi bisai 1875 se astitv main he
 In the last few years, new exchanges like MCX SX and United Stock Exchange have also been established, but they are yet to expand in all areas of the exchange
 yah puche jane par ki kya vah chaahati he ki enesai ko hameshaa yuva exange mana jaae, ramakrishna ne kaha, anubhav kaarobaar main bahut bada yogadan de saktaa he
 With this, the enthusiasm of the youth is also important, only then you can move forward
 jab ham apni ore dekhte hai ki ham 20 baras ke ho gaye, to hamaare saamne sabase badi chunauti yahi he ki kis tarah se yuva or anubhav ko milaayein

 com / yimjvmchlw bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya mahasachiv or jammu or kashmir ke liye party ke pramukh vaartakar ram madhav, anuchhed 370 ke 'kamjor padane' ke baad bhi ghati ke apekshaakrit shant rahane kaa shrey logon ke saath lagaataar sampark main rahane kii centre kii koshishon ko dete hai
 Madhav openly discussed with Group Editorial Director Raj Chengappa on the ever-changing conditions of the valley and the steps ahead
 kuch ansh:jammu or kashmir main modi sarkaar ke saamne pramukh chunautiyaan kya hongi?rajya ke log kaaphi had tak abhi sthitiyon ko lekar soch-vichaar kar rahe hai
 They are not in a hurry to reach any end
 haalanki unamem bahut-si baton ko lekar aitraaj he, phir bhi ghati se meraa input yah he ki acchhee-khaasi sankhya main saamaajik or saamudayik netaa aage aae or unhone hamaare prashasan ko bataaya ki ve sthitiyon ko sanbhaalenge or apane str se is baat kaa bharpoor prayaas karenge ki hinsa na hone paae
 This has been possible due to our engagement with people in the last five years
 yahaan tak ki agar kuch log hamaare is kaary se naaraaz hai, to bhi ve ise ek mauka dene ko taiyaar hai
 This is certainly a good sign and has been possible in the last one year due to honesty in the role and efforts of the administration in delivering goods to the people
 vah ab hamaare haq main kaam kar rahaa he
 There is a heavy deployment of forces in the valley
 ho saktaa he, is kaaran log apana aakrosh prakat na kar paa rahe hon?main isse sahamat nahin hum
 i see some of the reasons behind the incidents of violence and the reduction of angry demonstrations on the streets
 ghati main internet (or sanchaar) blassout jaisi baaten nai nahin hai
 i understand the psyche of the people of Kashmir — if they have decided to come out, then no restriction will stop them
 burhan vaani kii maut ke baad, internet band kar diya gaya tha or sena kii baari tainaati kii gai thi, phir bhi hajaaron log sadakon par nikal aate the or patharav kar dete the
 During this time, there were unfortunate incidents of firing in which some people were killed, and this further fueled the violence
 anumaanit 30,000 yaa usase adhik log tab bhi baahar nikle the jab hamane sadakon ko avaruddh kiya tha
 It is not being seen at the moment
 log hinsak tareeke se sadakon par utarane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Now, our challenge is that we should bring the benefits of this decision to the people of Jammu and Kashmir at the earliest
 yahi kaam he jisamen sabase zyada chunautiyaan hai
 What are the benefits of this decision that you want to reach people? First of all, people should feel that things have improved in terms of everyday needs
 duusari baat, main apni party se kah rahaa hum ki hamen jald se jald rajnatik prakriya shuru kerani chahie
 At present, the situation is not very favorable as many leaders have been either under precautionary arrest or arrested, as this is the need of the hour
 unamem se kuch log itnaa hangaamaa kyon machaa rahe hai? main, bataanaa chaahunga ki ehtiyathan hiraasat main le liya janaa or giraftaaryaan, rajanetaaon ke jivan kaa ek hissaa hai
 BJP is trying to create a new leadership by calling the mainstream leaders of the valley unreliable? When we talk of mainstream leaders in the valley, no one can count more than 3-4 people
 kya ve ghati ke ekmaatr netaa hai? pichley kai dashakon main, rajya main vibhinn staron par nae netritv ko ubharne dene kaa avasar kabhi nahin diya gaya
 We have given an opportunity for a new leadership to emerge here — and the emergence of leadership from the panchayat level has been its medium
 maine sarpanchon ke saath baatcheet kii he or ve bahut patibaddh hai or unki badi aakankshaayen hai
 What would you say about the threat of provocative terrorist attacks? Our security system is very vigilant and capable of dealing with the threat of any possible terrorist attack
 bhaajapa ne teen varshon ke liye pidipi ke saath gathbandhan kii sarkaar chalaai jiske baad rajyapal shashan laga
 The NDA government was not able to manage Kashmir well in its first term
 main asahmat hum
 We have taken several measures in the last five years, including a package of Rs 80,000 crore to the state, through which we have done a lot of development work in the state
 is prakriya main ham ghati main ek nae netritv ko paidaa karne main sakasham ho sake hai
 The Prime Minister himself has met many leaders
 logon se judye kaa vah prayaas bahut phydemand rahaa he, jo ab logon kii maun pratikriya se spasht he
 The most important thing is that we should be able to bring the benefits of development to all the people of the valley without any discrimination
 hamaare prayaas ab usee disha main honge
 Critics say that repealing Article 370 without the advice of the people of Kashmir was a big fraud
 jab anuchhed 370 ko laayaa gaya tha, to kisi ke vichaaron ko dhyaan main nahin rakhaa gaya tha—keval jawaharlal nehru ne shaikh abdulla ko ek vaada kiya tha jise nibhaayaa—jabaki bhartiya janata party saat dashakon se kah rahi he ki ham iske paksh main nahin hai
 When did we hide it? Then, we had two days of discussion in Parliament — the supreme body of democratic power decided on it
 sabhi apekshit sanvaidhanik prakriyaaon kaa paalan kiya gaya
 Don't forget that Article 370 has been amended at least 45 times in the last 60 years
 modi sarkaar ne jammu or kashmir ke darje ko ek rajya se ghataakar ek centreshasit pradesh tak simit kar diya—aisa aazaadee ke baad kisi anya rajya main kabhi nahin hua
 First of all, the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir is divided into two union territories
 lekin kendriya grih mantri ne sadan main yah kaha he ki jahaan tak jammu or kashmir (kshetra) kaa sambandh he, maujuuda vyavastha ek asthaayee upaay he
 It will soon get its full statehood back
 is samay rajya main bani kuch khaas paristhitiyon ke kaaran, ise kuch samay ke liye centre sarkaar ke nirdesh main chalaae jane kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The state will soon get the status of the state

 The successful people are determined to be the best that they can be and continuously strive for excellence
 They are go-getters who believe in finishing any task that they take up within the stipulated time
 They, like the others, have the option of deferring the work or evading what needs to be done, but they don’t
 The fact that they have a steely resolve to complete their tasks makes them succeed and sets them apart

 On this matter, there has now been a big statement of National Minorities Commission Chairman Ghayorul Hasan Rizvi

 He said, 'I was referring to those from Kashmir who celebrated Pakistan's victory (in the Champions Trophy final)
 un logo ko jinke dimag or dil pakistan main hai, bas unke sharir yahaan he, isliye unhen bhi vahaan chale janaa chahie
 They should stay there

 shila dikshit ne kaha ki ham chunaav achche nateezon ke liye lade the lekin jab tak aap khud majboot nahin honge tab tak aap ek acchhee ladaai nahin lard sakate
 He also said that there have been some shortcomings, but we should accept the mandate with respect
 bijepi kii jeet par congress netaa shila dikshit ne kaha ki aaj kaa maahaul unke paksh main he lekin hameshaa aisa nahin rah saktaa
 The Congress in Delhi has also run the government in Delhi for a long time and has run well
 aam aadmi party par shila dikshit ne kaha ki kejariwal ko punjab vidhansabha chunaav main haar mili, baaki rajyon main bhi unka pradarshan kharaab rahaa isse saaf jaahir he ki janata unako samaj chuki he
 The people of Delhi have not come to Kejriwal's trickery
 sandip kaa maakan par bada hamalasandip dikshit ne ajtak se kaha ki congress ne vaapasi kaa sunaharaa mauka kho diya he
 Actually, i had already told you that the leadership of Tangdil, Bujdil and lesser minds was imposed on Delhi
 maakan ke istife par barase sandip dikshitjab chunaav main wo apni chalaa rahe the, kisi kii nahin sun rahe the, to buree haar kii zinmedaari bhi unki hi banati he
 But how can they decide themselves that they will not take office for one year and take it after one year
 kya wo khud party hai, party se bade hai wo
 Maken himself can decide not to take the post, but the party decides what and when to give him the post

 In the last few years, there has been an upsurge in such a case which is pointing towards the seriousness of the situation

 Especially in older women, such cases are increasing

 In this episode, Delhi's renowned Max Institute of Cancer Care has given a new life to 9 such women whose body mass index was 40, with successful robotic surgery
 in sabhi mahilon kaa vajan jarurat se zyada tha or ye endometrial cancer ke stage 1 se jujh rahi thi
 Generally, this disease is found in older women, but now due to deteriorating lifestyle and obesity, it is becoming common even among 25 year old women
 pehle ke mukaable endometrial cancer ke maamle duguni tezi se bad rahe he, or ye sidhe taur par hamaare body maas index or lifestil par nirbhar karata he
 Normally the body mass index or BMI should be between 25 and 30, but crossing the BMI to 40 increases the risk of cancer by 9 times

 The biggest advantage of robotic surgery for women suffering from obesity and endometrial cancer is that it reduces blood loss and the pain after surgery is negligible
 saath hi motaape ke chalate marijo main diabetics bhi hoti he jiske kaaran narmal aaparishan ke samay unako anaesthesia dena sambhav nahi hota he
 Which is not needed in robotic surgery and at the same time robotic surgery is better in every sense than open surgery "

 jiske baad logon ne shashan ke prati apni naaraazgi khulkar jaahir kii
 For the government in 2016, these were some of the issues that might have taken a frightening form in the beginning to be ignored, and then overcoming it resulted in huge loss of life and property

 jiske baad aspataal ne shav ko le jane ke liye farmaan suna diya
 The father, who had lost his son, requested the hospital administration to deliver the body by ambulance but no one helped
 aakhirkaar is pita ne apane bete ke shav ko kandhe par uthaakar ghar ke liye chal diya
 When he was passing the hospital, crossing the city of Dang, then some people saw him and he came forward for help

 lekin piem modi ne notebandi ke elaan ke saath hi kah diya tha ki desh ko tarakkee kii raah par daudane ke liye sakht faisle lene ke liye wo hichakenge nahin
 He asked people for 50 days to get rid of the problem of demonetisation
 haalanki raajnneetik str par faisle kaa vipaksh ne joardaar virodh kiya
 But the government has made it clear that there is a need to take some drastic steps in the national interest and the Modi government will not hesitate to take such steps even further
 gauratlab he ki achaanak 8 november ko desh ke naam sambodhan main piem modi ne 500 or 1000 rupee ke note ko avaidh qaraar dete hue use chalane hataane kaa aadesh de diya
 After that, people started flocking outside banks and atms to exchange old notes and get new notes
 baari pareshaani or ghanton line main khadey hone ke baavjood logon ne kabhi bhi notebandi ke khilaaf aawaaj nahin uthaai
 This was a big relief for the government, as the government described demonetisation in the interest of the country and described it as the biggest step towards economic reform in the history of 60 years
 logon subah se shaam tak nakadi ke liye bainkon or atm ke baahar line main khadey rahe, lekin desh hit main uthaae gaye kadam ke khilaaf ek shabd nahin bolaa
 The decision of demonetisation in late 2016 has been troublesome for the general public till now, as the cash shortage has not yet been completely overcome
 lekin agar sarkaar kii ichhashakti kii baat kii jaae to modi sarkaar ne notebandi kaa faisla lekar ye sabit kar diya
 Even if its results are not as expected, but when the year 2016 comes, the important decision of demonetisation and Modi government will be mentioned
 bihar main sharabbandi bada faislabihar main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle mukhyamantri nitish kumaar sabhaaon main logon se vaada kiya gaya tha ki dobaaraa unki sarkaar banate hi rajya main sharaab kii bikri par pabandi laga di jaaegi
 Something similar happened
 satta main aate hi vidhansabha main sharabbandi kanoon paas kar diya or rajya main sharaab kii briki par puri tarah se pabandi laga di gai
 However, some people also approached the court against it
 lekin sarkaar ne nishchay kar liya tha ki bihar ko sharaab mukt karnaa he
 In the court, it was argued by the Nitish government that a ban on foreign liquor in the state has been imposed as per the provisions of the Indian Constitution
 yahi nahin, rajya sarkaar ne adaalat main kaha ki niyamon ke aadhaar par nagarikon ke swasthya ko dhyaan main rakhkar yah faisla liya he, or ye rajya sarkaar kaa adhikaar he
 In 2016, the Bihar government's decision on liquor ban was a very bold step, as its impact was bound to fall in the government account
 sharaab se sarkaar ko tex ke rup main badi rakam milti thi, jo sharabbandi ke saath hi ruuk gaya
 At the same time, the people of Bihar also openly supported Nitish, due to which Bihar has become completely alcohol free
 saal 2016 main bihar sarkaar kaa ye uthaaya gaya kadam varshon tak yaad rakhaa jayega
 In Jharkhand, Inder Singh Namdhari, an MP from Chatra, was ambushed by a Naxalite ambush in Latehar on Saturday evening, but the police security vehicle running behind him was hit by a Naxalite attack, which led to less than one police sub-inspector riding in it
 At least six soldiers and two civilians died on the spot while half a dozen other security personnel were casualties

 According to the report, Pakistani Rangers are constructing high dams made of clay on the indo-pakistan border along Jammu
 report ke mutabik is baandh ke jariye pakistani regers bharat ke khilaaf badi sajeesh ko bhi anjaam de sakate hai
 Because of the high dam, the activities of the Pakistan Rangers and the terrorists will not be known to the BSF personnel posted on the border

 The dam that Pakistani razors are engaged to build in Sukmal area is just 600-700 meters from the border

 sarkaar ke saath sahanubhuti rakhie
 She sometimes brings unique answers to questions
 jaise mandi or bekaari dur karne ke liye gaanvon main bijli ke khambhe lagaana
 It is like laying rail tracks to overcome water shortage

 This scheme will be applicable in those states where the electricity distribution network is in bad shape, electricity boards are in deficit, trying to overcome debt and the hours of electricity supply are few

 According to a report it had released earlier this year, the government's 12 major schemes with heavy spending and budgets failed miserably in 2016-17
 masalan, gramin sadak yojana 14 rajyon main lakshya se peeche rahi
 The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana fell behind in 27 states
 is report main dinadayal gram jyoti yojana bhi he jo 14 rajyon main thik dhang se nahin chali

 notebandi ke baad jandhan ko lakva maar gaya he
 Regarding the crop insurance scheme, the CAG has said that the insurance companies have taken advantage of it, the farmers did not get anything due to nature's havoc
 garibon ko muft gas conection dene vaali yojana ujjwala bhi ab duvidha kii shikaar he
 The scheme started well due to the central petrochemical companies, but it is difficult for Ujjwala holders to pay Rs 450 to fill the cylinder
 gramin ilaakon main mandi ke panje zyada gahare hai
 Kerosene and wood are cheaper than LPG
 uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh, bihar, odisha, rajasthan jaise rajyon main alpiji dharakon kii sankhya or alpiji kii khapat main bada jhol he
 The report of the Petrol Ministry's Research Cell states that the demand or consumption of LPG has not increased at the speed at which the connections have grown here after Ujjwala
 sirf aankade hi nahin, logon kaa najariya bhi skiimon ko lekar bahut utsahvardhak nahin he
 In August this year, India Today's 'mood of the Nation Survey' reported that the higher the popularity figure of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the deeper the unpopularity of his schemes
 inamen jan dhan, digital india jaisi badi scimen shaamil hai
 This is the situation when the Prime Minister takes his name in almost every other speech from the country to abroad and in the last three years, record breaking amount has been spent on the promotion of these schemes
 modi sarkaar manaregaa jaise kisi bade karishme kii talash main he jisaki poonch pakad kar chunaavon kii lambii baitarani paar ho sake
 Interestingly, the success of the MGNREGA was not in the employment received through it, but in the rates of wages raised through it
 manaregaa lagu hote samay aarthik vikaas kii gati tej thi isliye manaregaa ke sahare mazdooree daron kaa bazaar puri tarah shramikon ke mafik ho gaya
 The workers got higher wages in the village as well as in the cities
 agar mandi ke daur main manaregaa aati to shaayad ye nattejey nahin milte
 Actually, government schemes are not the solution to poverty
 1994 se 2012 tak kul aabaadi main nirdhanon kii taadaad 45 fisadi se ghatakar 22 fisadi rah gai
 The pace of poverty reduction between 2005 and 2012 was three times faster than in the previous decade
 dhyaan rakhana jaruri he ki yahi vah daur tha jab bharat kii aarthik vikaas dar sabase teji se badi
 We learn from history that we have not learned anything from history
 ham itihaas se yah bhi sikhte hai ki naseehaten na lene ke maamle main sarkarein sabase zyada ziddee hoti hai

 darasal, bihar main bijepi-jediu gathbandhan ko lekar hui siyaasi uthapatak ke bich adwani ne ek baar phir apni naaraazgi party ke adhyaksh rajnath singh se jataai he
 Sources were quoted as saying that on Sunday, Advani spoke to Rajnath Singh over phone

 According to sources, Advani blamed Narendra Modi's coronation for breaking the alliance
 adwani ne kaha ki gathbandhan tuutane kii vajah goa main kii gai jaldbaaji he
 Had there not been a ruckus over Modi's coronation, the 17-year-old relationship with the JDU would not have broken
 ab tay yah saaf he ki party ke daavon se thik vipareet adwani ab bhi naaraaz hai
 Perhaps due to this reason, even after withdrawing the resignation, he did not attend the press conference of top BJP leaders

 In October last year, the Chinese government newspaper Global Permit said in an article that despite China's objections, India will host the Dalai Lamaki in a disputed area along the china-india border in the coming weeks, before the Chinese foreign minister made the remarks

 The Dalai Lama is a Tibetan separatist, referring to the alleged remarks of Indian officials that this is a religious visit and that the Dalai Lama has undertaken several such visits before, the article states that the authorities do not realize the consequences
 lekh main kaha gaya ki yaa to in bhartiya adhikariyon ko dalai lamas kii yatra ke gambhir parinaam kaa ehsaas nahin he yaa phir unhone jaanboojhkar ise nazarandaaj kiya he, isamen kaha gaya, 14 wein dalai lamas kisi bhi tarah se ek aadhyatmik netaa nahin balki ek tibeti algaavvaadi hai
 Allowing the Dalai Lama to travel to the disputed region would inevitably result in confrontation, weakening the stability of the region and deteriorating india-china relations, the newspaper said

 They believe that India can gain many benefits by using the Dalai issue

 64 apni film tajamahalah ain itarnal lav story (2005) ke saath pakistan main bhartiya filmon par pichley 35 saal se chali aa rahi pabandi ko khatm karwaane main apni bhoomika ko lekar mujhe fakr he
 i wrote to the then Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf that neither the Pakistani nor the Indian government could deny that it was a common India when the Taj Mahal was built
 jahangir lahore main dafan hai, unke putr shahjahan agra main, noorjahan lahore main to unki bhatiji mumtaj mahal agra main
 Cinema is the best means of contact and love and should not be stopped in any way
 us vakt yah film pradhanmantri manmohan singh or montek singh ahaluwalia ko bhi dikhaai gai thi
 The Prime Minister said that due to his message of love, this film should also be shown to Pakistan
 maine unhen bataaya ki main pehle hi pakistani raashtrapati ko sht likh chukaa hum
 We got permission to release our film there and the ban on Indian films was lifted
 pakistan ke nyaute par paryaton or samskruti mantri ambika soni kii aguai main ek bade pratinidhimandal ne pakistan ke liye udaan bhari or rashtradhyakshon kii tarah se hamaara swaagat kiya gaya
 Mahesh Bhatt's film Nazar (2005) was then screened and opened the way for Indian films
 lekhakon, shaayaron, gayakon or abhinaytaon ke rup main pakistan ke paas umdaa tallent he
 But they lag behind in technology and expertise
 unhone kuch behtareen filmein banaai hai
 i consider director Shoaib Mansoor to be of international standard
 unki film khuda ke liye (2007) shandaar thi
 i think Shaan Shahid is a great actor
 main hameshaa se unke saath ek film bananaa chahta hum or mujhe lagata he ki unamem bharat kaa superstar hone kaa madda he
 Ali Zafar is another talented actor and singer
 kabhi pakistani tivi bade paimaane par bhartiya darshakon ke dilo-dimag par chaa gaya tha
 There was a huge demand for serials like weather, search, flight
 unka lekhan, abhinay, sangeet or geet sabhi umdaa kism ke the or yahaan ke log unke aadi ho gaye the
 One Pakistani film that i remember is Umrao Jaan Adaa (1972)
 badakismati se bol (2011) dekhne se pehle tak hamen koi bahut zyada acchhee pakistani filmein dekhne ko nahin milin
 Ali Haider is a good artist, Abdul Rashid Qadri was a great actor and Nur Jahan was amazing
 aaj tak maine jitani awa
 His voice was the most beautiful among the people i have heard
 ve tab filmon main abhinay kar rahi thim jab donon mulk ek hi the, isliye suraiya kii tarah ve bhi ham donon kii hai
 When the Taj Mahal was released in Pakistan, the closed theaters were reopened and repaired
 mere khyaal se vakt aa gaya he ki distribution network main donon mulkon ke udyogon kaa vilay kar diya jaae jo sarhad ke aar-paar filmon ko ek saath relies kiye jane kaa intjaam kare
 If our films can be released properly in Pakistan, then their distributors will earn, which they can invest in their film industry
 sarhad ke donon taraf kaam karne main kalakaaron ko koi dikkat nahin aani chahie
 Pakistan has good writers that we can use and they can take the help of our directors and technicians to improve the quality of their films
 ham pakistani pratibha ko kaam main len or ve hamaari pratibha kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 Punjabi films with loud comedy have a long tradition in Pakistan
 unamem koi taaja technology kii bhi jarurat nahin hoti, jisane paison kii kami ke saath milakar pakistan main filmon ke vikaas ko roak diya
 Pakistan needs to open technology schools to teach direction, cinematography and sound design, etc
 upmahadweep kii badi maani jane vaali filmein saz hindustan kii upaj thim
 The real phase of Pakistani cinema after partition has never really happened while the Indian film industry continued to grow
 jab ve acchhee filmein banaate bhi hai to ve kabhi-kabhaar hi hamen dekhne ko milti hai
 The filmmakers there are happy with the limited audience
 apni filmein bharat lekar aana unke liye pratishtha kamaane kaa mauka hoga or duniya ke saamne unhen pesh karne kii taraf ek bada kadam
 Congress leader Randeep Surjewala has accused the Modi government of scam in the purchase of Rafale aircraft
 surajevaala kaa kahana he ki rafel kharid main koi paardarshita nahin he

 saude kii yah shart thi ki 18rafel aircraftfrance main banenge or company kii madad se 108 aircraft bharat me banegein
 But during the tour of France, Prime Minister Modi announced the purchase of 36 aircraft directly from France
 surajevaala ne sawaal uthaae ki ladaaku jahaajon ko mahangi keemat par kyon kharida gaya or sarkaar rafel kii takanic ko transafar karne ke paksh main kyon nahin he
 The government is benefiting private companies by ignoring the interest of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited
 iske alaava surajevaala ne dasolt rafel or reliance ke bich hue samjhaute main prakriyaaon kaa paalan naa hone kii baat bhi kahi he
