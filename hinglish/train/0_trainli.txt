 a Delhi court on Wednesday directed the police to continue the investigation by dismissing the termination report filed by investigators in the controversial CD of the alleged conversation between lawyer Shanti Bhushan and leaders Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh
 mukhya metropalitan magistrate (siemem) vinod yadav ne dilli police kii samaapti report khaarij karte hue kaha ki yah spasht nahin he ki jaanch agency ne samaapti report daakhil karne main itani jaldibaji kyon kii jabaki yah spasht tha ki maamle main uchit jaanch nahin kii gayi he
 The court said that the motive for making the CD should be investigated whether it was done to weaken the campaign of Lokpal Bill or to discredit Bhushan
 adaalat ne sidi ko vaastavik nahin paane ke baad bhi bhrashtachar kaa maamla daakhil nahin karne par pehle bhi dilli police ko fatkaar lagaai thi
 The arguments were heard in the court on Bhushan's plea
 bhushan ne apni shikaayat radd karne kii maang karne vaali police report ko chunauti di thi
 The court also reprimanded the police for not recording voice samples of Amar Singh, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Shanti Bhushan while investigating the case
 dilli police ke vishesh prakoshth ne pichley saal agast main 14 april, 2011 ko ypi estate thane main bhushan kii shikaayat par darj maamle ko band karne kii anumati adaalat se maangi thi
 Bhushan denied any conversation
 tippaniyan He alleged that the CD has been prepared by 'cut and paste' to weaken the campaign launched for the Lokpal Bill
 police ne maamla band karne kii maang karte hue kaha ki jaalsaji ke aparaadh ko sabit karne ke liye koi ahm suraag nahin he, jaisaa ki aarope lagaaya gaya he
 Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) Vinod Yadav dismissed the Delhi Police termination report, saying it was unclear why the investigating agency had taken such a hurry to file the termination report even though it was clear that proper investigation had not been done in the case
 adaalat ne kaha ki sidi banane ke makasad kii jaanch kii jaani chahie ki kya lokapal vidheyak ke abhiyaan ko kamjor karne ke liye aisa kiya gaya yaa bhushan ko badnaam karne ke liye kiya gaya
 The court had earlier reprimanded the Delhi Police for not filing a corruption case even after the CD was not found to be genuine
 adaalat main bhushan kii yachika par daleelein suni gayin
 Bhushan had challenged the police report seeking cancellation of his complaint
 adaalat ne maamle kii jaanch karte samay amar singh, mulaayam singh yadav or shanti bhushan kii aawaaj ke namoonay ricard nahin karne par bhi police ko kadi fatkaar lagaai
 In August last year, on 14 April 2011, the Special Cell of the Delhi Police had asked the court for permission to close the case registered on Bhushan's complaint at the IP Estate Police Station
 bhushan ne kisi tarah kii baatcheet se inkaar kiya tha
 The comments unhone aarope lagaaya tha ki sidi ko ‘cat and paste’ karke taiyaar kiya gaya he taaki lokapal vidheyak ke liye chalaaye gayi abhiyaan ko kamjor kiya ja sake
 Seeking to close the case, the police said that there was no significant clue to prove the crime of forgery, as alleged

 bharat ke khilaaf maujuuda test shrinkhalaa main asafalataa se niraash srilanka ke star aaf spinner muthaiya muralidharan ne kaha ki vah ab pehle jaise khatarnaak gendbaaj nahin rahe or upmahadweep main 2011 main hone vaale vishwa cap se pehle hi sabhi praroopon se sanyas le sakate hai
 Muralitharan has announced his retirement from Test cricket after next year's series against the West Indies
 unhone kaha ki vah upmahadweep main hone vaale 2011 vishwa cap se pehle hi cricket ko alavida kah sakate hai
 Sri Lanka are trailing 0-1 in the current three-match series against India and the final match will begin in Mumbai from December 2
 muralidharan ne ‘da nesan’ se kaha, ‘‘main 37 varsh kaa hum or pehle kii tarah gendbaaji nahin kar saktaa kyonki 15-16 over ke baad main thak jaataa hum
 But i will try to play one-day cricket, in which only 10 overs have to be bowled
 agar mujhe lagata he ki sab kuch thik nahin chal rahaa he to shaayad main vishwa cap se pehle hi anya donon praaroop se bhi sanyas le saktaa hum
 "but Muralitharan said," But it all depends on my body
 meraa sharir mujhe ekadivasiy cricket khilne kii anumati de saktaa he kyonki yah 50 over kaa match hota he
 It is a bit difficult in Test cricket because i have always been a threat to the opposing teams
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘lekin abhi aisa nahin lag rahaa he kyonki ballebaaj mujhe acchhee tarah khel rahe hai
 i think i made the right decision to retire from the Test at the end of the series against the West Indies next year
 ’’ muralidharan ko 800 test wicket hasil kar yah karnama karne vaala pehla gendbaaj banane ke liye keval 12 wicket kii jarurat he
 The world's highest wicket-taker has taken five wickets for 396 runs at an average of 79 in two Tests against India so far
 unhone kaha, ‘‘do teen saal pehle aisa nahin tha
 Injuries also continue
 pichley do test main gendbaajon ke liye anukool paristhitiyaan nahin thi
 "he said," There was a time when the team depended on me for wickets, but now this has changed
 anya gendbaajon ko bhi mauka milanaa chahie, jaise rangana herath or ajanta mendis acha kar rahe hai
 They have to take responsibility in future
 ’’muralidharan ne kaha, ‘‘maine pichley 18 varsh main jo hasil kiya he, vah kisi ke liye bhi mushkil hoga kyonki maine ek pari main 66 baar paanch wicket or 22 baar 10 wicket chatkaye hai
 a spinner cannot do this, but the bowlers unit can get wickets against opposition teams
 ’’ vah bharat ke chauthe or antim daure par hai
 But he is finding it difficult to adjust to the Indian flat pitches and the hosts have left no stone unturned in the series so far
 unhone kaha, ‘‘prayek cricketer hataasha se gujarata he
 Whatever you want from life, it does not happen
 peeche mudakar dekhte hue main kah saktaa hum ki meraa karier shandaar rahaa
 Even if we do not win in India, it is fine

 rajkot test kii pehali paar main england kaa 500 ke paar score le janaa team india kii chunauti kitni mushkil kar gaya he is baat kaa andaaza is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki videshi team ne 25veen baar bharat main ye (500 kaa) aankada paar kiya he
 India could never win the last 24 times
 team india ke khilaadiyon ne pehali pari main kai kaich chode jisaki vajah se england ke khilaadiyon ko is score tak pahunchane main bahut aasaani hui
 But all-rounder Moin Ali, who scored a century in the first innings, has probably tried to play a mind game too, by emphasizing the same thing
 rajkot main duusare din kaa khel khatm hone ke baad moin ali ne kaha, 'hamane aisa pehle bhi kiya he
 It happens in cricket
 lekin kaich chute or din main hamaari lay ban gai
 But this happens in cricket and i am sure the players (of Team India) will be working on it
 ' In fact, Indian fielders gave up three catches in the very first hour of the match
 yahi nahin, duusare din ben stokes ke do kaich chute (60 or 61 ke score par riddhimaan saaha or umesh yadav ne chode kaich) or stokes ne pari main sabase zyaada 128 ran bana liye
 Alastair Cook's catch from Mohammed Shami in the first over of the first day of the Rajkot Test was caught in the street
 phir duusare over main umesh yadav kii gend par viraat kohli kaich lapak nahin paye
 Apart from all this, the level of Indian fielding cannot be said to be good, for which the team management will definitely be concerned
 lekin moin ali ne press conference main is baat par jor daalkar team india par shaayad ek alag dabaav banane kii koshish kii he
 Even former captain Sunil Gavaskar criticized the fielding of the Indian team
 NDTV se baat karte hue gavaskar ne kaha, 'maidan par ajinkya rahane ke alaava baaqi khilaadi ghutanon par haath rakh kar khadey hote hai jo sahi takanic nahin he
 Australia and The
 africa main gend qamar se upar aati he
 But on India's pitches the ball comes down from the knees
 isliye jhuk kar khadey hona zaruri he
 Comments isse pehle 32 test main 88 wicket le chuke moin ali ne ye bhi kaha ki pich kii oochaal or daraar unki gendbaazi ko madad kar sakati he
 The left-handed batsman and right-handed off-spinner said, "the bounce of this pitch is decreasing
 pich kii daraar khul rahi he
 The pitch also had spin
 ye pich kal or aaj acchhee thi
 i think the bounce of this pitch will cause problems
 ' unhone yah bhi kaha ki yahaan kii pich bangladesh se bilkul alag he
 But he also said that he knows that the pitches here are going to be difficult for him even further
 birmingham ke 29 saal ke is olerounder ne kaha ki wo 200 gend khilne kaa lakshya banaakar utarate hai
 He also said that if he plays 200 balls, he can score a century
 unhone bataaya ki wo bataur spinner bhi apana role acchhee tarah adaa karnaa chaahate hai
 He also hoped that the match would result
 yani bina koi wicket khoe 474 ke pahaad kaa peechha kar rahi team india ke liye chunautiyaan bad gai hai
 As captain Virat Kohli said on the statement of captain Alastair Cook (cook had given his team the title of underdog) before the match started, he did not want to focus on England's things
 ummid kii jaani chahie ki is baar bhi team india dressing room main apane plan ko thos tareeke se lagu karne kii yojana par kaam kar rahi hogi
 Team India players missed several catches in the first innings, due to which it was very easy for England players to reach this score
 lekin pehali pari main shatak lagane vaale olerounder moin ali ne isi baat par jor daalkar shaayad ek mind game bhi khilne kii koshish kii he
 After the end of the second day's play in Rajkot, Moin Ali said, 'we have done this before
 aisa cricket main hota he
 But the catches were untouched and became our rhythm during the day
 lekin cricket main aisa hota he or mujhe yakeen he khilaadi (team india ke) is par kaam kar rahe honge
 ' darasal bhartiya filders ne match ke pehle din pehle hi ghante main teen kaich chhod die
 Not only this, on the second day Ben Stokes missed two catches (riddhiman Saha and Umesh Yadav scored 60 and 61) and Stokes scored 128 runs in the innings
 rajkot test ke pehle din pehle hi over main mohammad shami kii gend par elister cook kaa kaich gali main chuta
 Then in the second over, Virat Kohli could not catch a catch off Umesh Yadav
 in sabake alaava bhi bhartiya filding kaa str umdaa nahin kaha ja saktaa jise lekar team management zarur fikramand hogi
 But Moin Ali has tried to create a different pressure on Team India by emphasizing this in the press conference
 yahaan tak ki purv captain sunil gavaskar ne bhi bhartiya team kii filding kii aalochana kii
 Speaking to NDTV, Gavaskar said, "apart from Ajinkya Rahane on the field, the rest of the players stand with their hands on their knees which is not the right technique
 australia or da
 In Africa, the ball comes above the waist
 lekin bharat kii pichon par gend ghutanon se neeche aati he
 Therefore it is important to stand down
 'tippaniyan Earlier, Moin Ali, who has taken 88 wickets in 32 Tests, also said that the bounce and crack of the pitch can help his bowling
 baayen haath ke ballebaaz or daaen haath ke is of spinner ne kaha, 'is pich kii oochaal kam ho rahi he
 Pitch cracks are opening
 pich main spin bhi thi
 This pitch was good yesterday and today
 mujhe lagata he is pich kii oochaal mushkilen paidaa karegi
 He also said that the pitch here is completely different from Bangladesh
 lekin ye bhi kaha ki unhen pataa he ki yahaan kii pichen unke liye aage bhi mushkil hone ja rahi hai
 The 29-year-old all-rounder from Birmingham said that he sets off by aiming to play 200 balls
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki agar wo 200 genden khel lete hai to wo shatak bana sakate hai
 He told that he also wants to play his role well as a spinner
 unhone ye bhi ummid jataai ki match main nateeja nikalegaa
 That is, the challenges have increased for Team India chasing 474 mountain without losing any wicket
 jaisaa ki match shuru hone se pehle captain viraat kohli ne captain elister cook ke bayaan (cook ne apni team ko anderdog kaa tamgaa diya tha) par kaha tha ki wo england kii baton par fokas nahin rakhana chaahate
 It should be hoped that this time too, Team India will be working on a plan to implement its plan in a concrete way in the dressing room

 Underlining that Pakistan has taken 'highly provocative' action, India has said that meaningful dialogue with this country can only be possible if it literally meets the commitment to not allow terrorist activities against it from its soil Landed
 bharat ne yah bhi kaha he ki seemaa paar se ghuspaith, niyantran rekha or antarrashtriya seemaa par pakistan dwaara yudhviram ke ulanghan ko lekar ‘satat chintaaen’ hai
 In its annual report for the year 2009-10, the Ministry of External Affairs has said that our position is that meaningful dialogue with Pakistan can only happen if it does not use its land in any form for terrorist activities against India
 Fulfill your commitment literally

 panchayat gujarat kaarykram ke ahm satr abaki baar vikaas par maar main kendriya raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman or congress pravaktaa randip singh surajevaala ne kii
 The session was moderated by India Today Television managing editor Rahul Kanwal
 sitaraman ne kaha ki kya congress yah bataa sakati he ki kyon rajeev gandhi ko bharat ratna dene main mahaj 45 din lage or sardaar patel ko bharat ratna dene main 41 saal laga die
 Is the Gujarat model an example for the entire country or has development gone mad in Gujarat alone
 nirmala sitaraman ne kaha ki yah hakeekat he ki vikaas ke liye gujarat model ek safal model he
 Sitharaman said that the Congress's propaganda that development has gone mad in Gujarat is a lewd joke
 kisi ek rashtriya party jise dibet main syrius hokar shaamil hona chahie vah is tarah se majaaj uda rahe hai
 Sitharaman said that development is a serious issue in the country today
 congress ko saamne aakar gujarat model ke jawaab main ek apana model saamne karte hue dibet karnaa chahie tha jisase desh ko ek adarsh model par chalate hue viksit kiya ja sake
 But now the Congress party also likes to joke on big issues of politics
 ise bhi padhein: EXCLUSIVE: jai shah kii company par uthe sawaalon par pehali baar amit shah kii safainirmala ke jawaab main congress netaa ne kaha ki desh main jumale kii raajnneeti kii shuruyaat bijepi ke netaaon ne kii he
 Speaking on the politics of Gujarat, Surjewala said that when Dalits will be oppressed, people will not be given jobs and the youth will stumble from rate to rate then in such a situation, development is crazy
 surajevaala ne kaha ki gujarat ab shiksha, swasth or rojgaar jaise muddon par buree tarah pichad gaya he
 Responding to the madness of development in Gujarat, Nirmala said that if it were to happen then why BJP is winning elections in states one after the other
 nirmala ne congress netaa kii khinchaai karte hue kaha ki jis narmada ke mudde par aaj congress chilla rahi he kya usee kii sarkaar ne isi narmada project ke jariye gujarat tak pani nahin pahunchane diya
 However Surjewala said that the Modi government minister is not fully aware
 yah baandh mahaj isliye ban pai kyonki congress ke mukhyamantri ne hi ise banane ke liye jameen di thi
 Nirmala said why the Congress government did not allow the deal to happen when the surplus power first came to power during the Modi government in Gujarat and wanted to speed up the pace of development here by selling that surplus power to Maharashtra
 kya yah congress ne gujarat ke model ko fail karne ke liye nahin kiya
 The Congress leader spoke on the slogan of bjp's Congress Mukt Bharat that how any ruling party within democracy talks of destroying the opposition instead of working together with the opposition
 kya yahi bijepi kii loktantric samaj he ki desh main sirf ek party rahe or vipaksh main koi na rahe
 Speaking on the issue of employment, Surjewala said that with the speed at which the Modi government is giving jobs to fulfill your promise, it will take 250 years to give job to all unemployed in the country

 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah sharply criticized the execution of Afzal Guru, saying it would create a sense of alienation and injustice again in generations of youth of the Valley
 umr ne kaha ki yah ‘dukhad’ he ki faansee se pehle guru ko apane parivaar se milane nahin diya gaya or antim vidaai kii bhi anumati nahin di gayi
 Afzal Guru, accused in the Parliament attack case, was hanged on Saturday in a secret process and was buried in the Tihar Jail premises
 afjal kii faansee se naaraaz dikh rahe umr ne kaha ki kai sawaal the jinka jawaab die jane kii jarurat thi
 Omar said the long-term implication of Afzal's hanging is 'quite worrisome' as he belongs to a new generation of youth in Kashmir who may not be familiar with the Maqbool Bhatt case but will be familiar with Afzal
 bhatta ko bhartiya rajanyik rabindra mahatre kii britain main hatya maamle main 1984 main faansee di gayi thi
 The Chief Minister said that please understand that there is more than one generation of Kashmiris who see themselves as victims, who see themselves in that category of people who will not get justice
 umr ne kaha ki aap ise pasand karen yaa nahin, afjal kii faansee se yah bindu majboot hua he ki unke (nai peedi ke) liye nyaay nahin he or yah meri samaj se suraksha jaise taatkaalik nihitarth kii apeksha adhik chintajanak or pareshaan karne vaala he
 The Chief Minister said that he has no answer to how we will be able to remove his perception of injustice and alienation
 umr ne khud ko mrityudand ke khilaaf bataate hue kaha ki jab tak kanoon main maut kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan bana rahata he, chuninda aadhaar par karrwai nahin honi chahie
 Asked whether the UPA government acted on selective basis by hanging Afzal, Omar said that it would have to be proved before the Kashmiris and the world that Afzal's hanging was not a selective action
 unhone kaha ki mujhe lag rahaa tha ki aaj nahin to kal afjal ko faansee di jaaegi
 Generations of Kashmiris will be familiar with Afzal
 aapako duniya ke saamne sabit karnaa hoga ki maut kii sajaa kaa istemaal chuninda aadhaar par nahin kii gayi he
 It is the responsibility of the judiciary and political leadership that this hanging was not on selective basis
 mukhyamantri ne is baat par sahmati jataayi ki kai logon kaa maananaa he ki afjal kii sunwaayee trutipurna thi
 He said that there are many such voices in the rest of the country who have similar opinions
 umr ne kaha ki agar centre apane ko is aarope se bachaana chahta he ki afjal kii faansee kanoonee ke badale raajnneetik thi to use anya aise abhiyukton ke bare main sawaalon kaa jawaab dena hoga jinhen maut kii sajaa sunaayi gayi he
 He said that many others have also been sentenced to death who have been involved in the attack on democracy
 unhone sawaal kiya ki kya kisi pradesh ke mukhyamantri loktantr ke pratik nahin hai? kya koi purv pradhanmantri loktantr ke pratik nahin hai? nishchit taur par, ve hai
 He was indirectly referring to the cases involving the killers of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh
 umr ne kaha ki kai sawaalon kaa jawaab die jane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The Chief Minister said that it is difficult to understand the words used in the judgment of the Supreme Court
 faisle main samuhik vivek ko santusht kiye jane kii baat kii he
 You cannot hang someone to satisfy the collective conscience
 balki iske liye kanoonee jaruraton ko puraa karnaa hoga
 Regarding not allowing the family to be hanged before hanging, Omar said that this is a sad side of the hanging on humanitarian grounds
 mukhyamantri ne dak ke jariye afjal ke parivaar ko suchit kiye jane ke auchity par sawaal kiya or kaha ki is madhyam kii vishwasaneeyata hi sawaalon ke ghere main he
 He said that if we are informing someone by post that his family member is being hanged, then there is definitely some serious flaw in the system
 umr ne kaha ki kai anya log hai jinhen pehle hi maut kii sajaa sunaayi gayi he
 Now i understand that you have hanged the Guru in the Parliament attack case and you say that Parliament is a symbol of democracy
 samaj gaya or ab koi bahes nahin
 He expressed concern that his government was informed of the hanging just 12 hours earlier
 unhone kaha ki unhen is baat kaa dukh he ki afjal ke parivaar ko sahi samay par soochna nahin di gayi

 azaad ne centre sarkaar par jajon ke apmaan kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki raashtrapati shashan pehle bhi laga he, lekin itane krur tareeqe se kabhi nahin lagaaya gaya
 On behalf of the government, the first Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that the government has no problem in discussing President's rule, but when matters are under consideration of the courts, they cannot be discussed
 maamle main sipiem ke mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne congress kaa saath dete hue kaha ki jab vishvavidhyalayon main chaatro ke andolan kaa vivaad chal rahaa tha, tab aapane us par charchaa kii thi or tab is niyam kaa hawala nahin diya tha
 After this, Arun Jaitley, leader of the ruling party in the case, citing Rule 169, said that when the issue of President's rule comes up, it can be discussed but not at the pre-proclamation stage

 mobile phone sarvice dene vaali company tata docomo ne deshbhar main roming ke liye prati second billing suvidha shuru kar di haih isse pehle airtel ne pichley hafte roming shulk daron main baari katautee kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The company said in a statement released on Sunday that its new offering is for all incoming and outgoing local and STD services on mobile or landline phones on any network
 maujuuda samay main oparator prati minute roming shulk vasuulate hai or yah shulk jagah or network par alag-alag nirbhar karata he
 This initiative by Tata Docomo will increase competition among mobile companies in terms of roaming charges
 isse pehle, tata docomo ne local or astidi kol ke liye ek paisa prati second kii skim pesh kii thi jisase anya companiyon ko bhi yah suvidha shuru kerani padi thi
 The statement of retired Justice AK Patnaik came that he had not found any evidence of corruption in the report of the Central Vigilance Commissioner against Verma
 supreme court ne hi justise patnayak se kaha tha ki ve sivisi kii report kii jaanch karen
 Patnaik investigated and submitted his report to the Supreme Court within fourteen days
 unhone verma ko bhi apana paksh rakhane kaa mauqaa diya
 It also said that the CVC sent the signed statements of Special Director Rakesh Asthana but Asthana did not give such a statement in front of him
 indian express main justise patnayak kaa bayaan chapa he
 He has said all this in a conversation with Seema Chishti
 unka kahana he ki kendriya satarkta ayuktaki report antim shabd nahin he
 Justice Patnaik's statement that i have stated in my report that no allegations made in the report of the Central Vigilance Commissioner have found evidence of corruption
 justise patnayak ne yah report supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish ranjan gogoi ko hi di thi
 Justice Patnaik also said that the Supreme Court had said that even if the High Power Committee decides, it should not have been decided in such haste
 khaaskar jab usamen supreme court ke jaj the tab cameti ko gaharaai se sochna chahie tha
 Now we have to understand here
 supreme court ne verma ke kilaaf maamalon kii jaanch ke liye justise patnayak se kaha
 Justice Patnaik gave his report, so why did the Supreme Court not take its stand on that report? Did the High Power Committee consider Justice Patnaik's report made by order of the Supreme Court? Did CVC report give more importance than Patnaik's report? Did Justice Sikri take any stand on the Supreme Court report? So what happened in this case? The CVC made a list of allegations against Verma
 sarkaar ne verma ko hataa diya
 Verma goes to Supreme Court
 supreme court kahata he ki verma ke kilaaf sivisi ne jo saamagree pesh kii he vah pad se hataane ke liye aparyaapt he
 Verma is restored
 ab pradhanmantri ke netritv main bani cameti unheen apramanit aaropon ke aadhaar par verma ko hataa detii he
 The pro-government devotees campaign on social media that Justice Sikri also considered the report to the CVC as correct
 andeh kii sui pradhanmantri kii taraf thi ki ve rafaal maamle main jaanch rokane ke liye verma ko hataanaa chaahate hai
 The first attempt to remove Verma was not successful in the Supreme Court
 lihaaza pradhanmantri ko bachaane ke liye bhaktagan justise sikri ke vot kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 On the other hand, Special Director Rakesh Asthana had reached Delhi High Court to quash the FIR lodged against him by Verma
 dilli hai court ne ulta sibiai ko das hafton ke bheetar jaanch puri karne kaa aadesh de diya he
 Now let's look at one more thing
 sab kuch aapaki ankhon ke saamne manage hota dikh rahaa he
 Institutions have been enslaved
 media baqayada godi media ho chukaa he
 Yet why is Amit Shah afraid that if he loses in 2019, he will be enslaved? Are they scaring BJP workers? What is the way to get excited about victory that if you lose, you will become a slave? Even before this, the BJP has lost, did its workers become enslaved? What are the slaves in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh? Amit Shah is afraid of whose slavery? Have they become so enslaved of their crimes that they are afraid of defeat? Does Amit Shah also not trust the great army and institutions of India? Then why do they say that if they lose in 2019, two hundred years of slavery will come? In Delhi, Amit Shah has said that the 2019 battle is the third battle of Panipat
 maraathon ke haarane ke baad do sau saal kii ghulaami ai thi
 Amit Shah sometimes tells his political rival that he is a snake pet dog and sometimes Ahmed Shah Abdali
 kya bijepi apane virodhiyon ko ahamed shah abdali maanati he? aisa maanane ke kya aadhaar hai uske paas? kya amit shah ke paas sampradayikta ke khaanche main fit hone vaale aise hi roopak or naare batch gaye hai?bhaajapa ke kaaryakartaaon ko sochna chahie
 Is it not that Amit Shah has converted his surrender into slavery? amit shah khai main kudane ko kahenge to khai main kud jaaenge
 After five years, is there any work that can be taken with the public? Are there metaphors like slavery and the third battle of Panipat to go public? The way the Supreme Court did not give a clear verdict in the case of Alok Verma, did not consider the Patnaik report made by his own order, Alok Verma was removed, before the news of Jai Shah was suppressed, the news of Judge Loya was exposed
 , All were acquitted in the Sohrabuddin encounter case
 aazam khan gujarat ke purv grih mantri haren pandya ke hatyaron ke bare main bayaan detaa he, sab chup ho jate hai
 In the Rafal case, the Supreme Court referred to the CAG report which was not presented in the Standing Committee of Parliament
 na supreme court phir kuch kahata he or na sarkaar
 The CBI and Election Commission were used to prosecute cases against twenty mlas of the Aam Aadmi Party for two years, raising fears in the media that now the AAP government would fall
 kya aapako pataa he ki ve saare cese kahaan hai?gunahon kii ye suchi or bhi lambii ho sakati he
 But why is the fear of slavery haunting Amit Shah? Shah and Modi are the emperors
 unhen ab jeetne ke liye kaaryakartaaon ko kyon daraana pad rahaa he? dekho lag jaao, jaan laga do varna haar gaye to ham ghulaam ho jaaenge
 What has the worker done that he should be afraid of slavery if he loses? Have the leaders done something similar?

 In the Central Hall in Parliament House, there was a continuous meeting with Daweji
 ve or prabhaat jha hameshaa saath rahete
 Daweji told many facts of his life which were surprising
 unhone bataaya ki narmada kii unhone kai baar parikrama kii he
 From the point of origin to the place where he met Amarkantak
 unhone bataaya ki wo payalat bhi hai or ek baar unhone narmada kii ye parikrama hawaii jahaaj se kii thi
 Not only this, once he has also done this journey by boat

 His NGO Narmada Samagra also worked to save the rivers
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle unhone shivaji ke ek anuthe pahalu par kitaab likhi
 This aspect of Shivaji was about his administrative ability
 unhone ise swaraj kii kalpana se jod kar bataaya ki kis tarah se aane vaali sarkaar ko shivaji ke prashasnic model ko lagu karnaa chahie
 Interestingly, the preface of this book was written by the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, who later became the Prime Minister
 is pustak ko aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ne jari kiya tha
 Today, when there is a desire among the leaders to immortalize their name, Dave ji has set an example in this matter
 unke nidhan ke baad unke bhai ne unki vasiyat ko jari kiya
 Anil Dave wrote his will on 23 July 2012
 isamen unhone likhaa tha ki unki smriti main koi bhi smarak, pratiyogita, puraskaar, pratimaa ityadi jaise kisi vishay ko na chalaaya jaae
 The comments unhone ye ichha vyakt kii thi ki unhen yaad karne kaa ek hi tarika hoga ki vrikshon ko boyaa jaae or unhen bada kiya jaae
 He also expressed his desire to save the river and reservoirs in his memory, but also urged that his name should not be used in it
 unke nidhan ke baad kai pramukh vyaktiyon ne kaha ki unhen paryaavaran mantri bana kar pradhanmantri narendra modi ne unki yogyata kaa sammaan kiya tha
 He could not work as environment minister for even a year, but in this short period, he tried his best to put his life experiences in the work of the ministry
 narmada ke is sevak ko shradhanjali
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, he wrote a book on a unique aspect of Shivaji
 shivaji kaa yah pahalu unki prashasnic kshamta ke bare main tha
 He linked this with Swaraj's imagination and explained how the coming government should implement Shivaji's administrative model
 dilachasp baat yah he ki is pustak kii prastaavna gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri narendra modi ne likhi thi, jo baad main pradhanmantri bane
 This book was released by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat

 As soon as the Jawaharlal Nehru University election comes to Delhi University, there is a discussion of 'presidential Debate' here, but this time also Presidential Debate could not be possible here
 jabaki jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay main ‘presidential dibet’ hone vaali he
 Election Officer of Delhi University, Dr
 satish kumaar kii raay main is vishvavidhyalay main ‘presidential dibet’ ke liye upyukt maahaul nahin he
 He also said that the university administration has not received any written request from any student organization regarding 'presidential Debate'
 jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay or dilli vishvavidhyalay na keval dilli balki desh or videsh ke pratishthit vishvavidhyalayon main gine jate hai
 Jawaharlal Nehru University has a tradition of 'presidential Debate', which is not done in Delhi University
 dilli vishvavidhyalay main ‘presidential dibet’ karaae jane ke sawaal par saaf inkaar karte hue is vishvavidhyalay ke nirvachan adhikari dow
 Satish Kumar said, 'the open campus of this university is the biggest obstacle for' Presidential Debate '
 yahaan collejon kaa kshetra bhi bada he, jiske kaaran enesayuai, abivipi ke kaaryakartaaon ke badi sankhya main pahunchane par inhen niyantrit karnaa mushkil hoga
 He said that at times there were reports of confrontation between ABVP and NSUI activists and it could be a problem for the university if such a situation arises during the 'presidential debate'
 haalanki hamen ‘presidential dibet’ ko lekar abhi tak kisi kii taraf se koi aagrah nahin mila he
 Professor D
, Chief Electoral Officer of Delhi University
 es
 Rawat said, "there is no presidential debate in this university, but student organizations are allowed to campaign on the Delhi University Community Radio (DUCR), a community radio channel of Delhi University
 bas, prachaar se koi hinsa nahin failni chahie
 Last year too, we allowed organizations to campaign on the DUCR
 is saal abhi tak kisi bhi sanghathan kii taraf is tarah kii maang nahin ai he
 ducr's program manager Vijayalakshmi Sinha said, "student organizations are allowed to campaign on Delhi University's community radio channel, but they cannot talk about anything politically motivated or violent
 iske liye ham pehle unki patakatha dekhte hai phir unhen radio par bolne kii ijaajat milti he
 The same happened last year
 haalanki is baar abhi tak hamaare paas kisi sanghathan kii taraf se chunaav prachaar ke liye samay nahin maanga gaya he
 While issuing his manifesto on September 10, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) Presidential candidate Ankit Chaudhary had said that his organization is in favor of 'presidential Debate' in the university but he is not supported by the university administration
 getting
 duusari ore enesayuai kaa kahana he ki ve lingadoh samiti kii siforeeshon ke anuroop hi koi kadam uthaaenge
 President of AISA (all India Students Association) candidate Nikita Sinha says that her organization is also in favor of 'presidential Debate' in Delhi University like Jawaharlal Nehru University but the attitude of university administration is not right
 esefai (student federation of india) ke adhyaksh pad ke pratyaashee camel kumaar arya bhi ‘presidential dibet’ ke pakshdhar hai
 In this round of allegations, the discussion of 'presidential Debate' in Delhi University is gaining momentum
 vishvavidhyalay main ‘presidential dibet’ nahin hone ke liye collejon ke vistrut kshetra ko ek mahatvapurn kaaran bataaya gaya he
 However, there has also been a demand for the university's closed campus by student organizations

 After RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav was jailed in the fodder scam, the party was taken over by his younger son and former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav, but Tejashwi Yadav is being led by many top leaders of the party
 tejasvi kii party kii kaman sanbhaalane ke baad mangalvaar ko party ke purv pravaktaa ashok kumaar sinha ne party chhod di
 Ashok Sinha said that he does not accept Tejashwi's leadership and that is why he is leaving the party
 tejasvi yadavake khilaaf ashok kumaar sinha ke uthaae kadam par bolte hue upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne twit karke kaha he ki party ke kai varisht netaa tejasvi ke netritv main ghutan mahasoos kar rahe hai or bahut jald vah bhi party chodenge
 Modi said that the party's top leaders are ready to leave the party and are only waiting for the right time
 modi ne kaha ki argedy ke andar mache ghamaasan se tejasvi yadav itane baichaiyn ho chuke hai ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke khilaaf anargal bayaanbaji kar rahe hai
 Modi said that RJD itself is on the verge of breakdown and in such a situation, Tejashwi Yadav is unnecessarily spreading the illusion of breakdown in NDA
 tejasvi par tanj kasate hue modi ne kaha ki duusare ke ghar main foot dekhne se apane ghar kii daraaren nahin mit jaati
 Referring to the attack on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's convoy in Nandan village of Buxar last month and the subsequent police action against local Mahadalit families there, Sushil Modi said that the central government and the state government are ensuring that Dalits and There should not be any atrocities with the deprived community and if any such incident happens, the culprits should be punished immediately
 susheel modi ne kaha kibihar sarkaar main yadi kisi dalit kii hatya hoti he to unke ashriton ko rajya sarkaar 8
 50 lakh and rape victim is being given 5 lakh rupees
 vahiin duusari taraf loksabhaa or sabhi vidhansabhaon ke chunaav ek saath karaane ke mudde par twit karte hue modi ne kaha ki centre sarkaar or pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa donon chunaav ek saath karaane kaa vichaar budhimatapurna he
 Modi has welcomed the manner in which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has also agreed to hold elections to the Lok Sabha and all the assemblies together
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bayaan ke baad desh kii kendriya raajnneeti main pakaadon kii charchaa he
 Modi had recently said in one of his TV interviews that even those who earn 200 rupees a day by selling pakoda can be counted among the employed
 congressi netaaon ne is bayaan ko nishane par liya tha
 Now BJP has made this statement of Modi a question of its prestige
 somvaar ko bijepi adhyaksh or rajyasabha saansad amit shah ne apane pehle bhaashan main modi ke isi bayaan ke ird-gird apni baat rakhi
 In fact, after this statement, Modi came under target of all opposition leaders and Amit Shah and BJP have come to the rescue of this statement of Modi
 hangaamaa kyon he barapa?darasal congress or bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle vaada kiya tha ki agar unki sarkaar ai to har saal karodon rojgaar paidaa kiye jaaenge
 The Congress did not get a chance to form the government, but if the BJP is in the government then people are asking for their account
 tab piem pad ke ummidavaar rahe narendra modi ne 2013 main agra kii ek raily main kaha tha ki unki sarkaar har saal ek karod logon ko rojgaar degi
 Now the Union government is about to be completed four, so the opposition parties are attacking the BJP on this question
 70 lakh rojgaar or 'pakora swarozgaar'haal hi main do arthshaastriyon palak ghosh or saumy kanti ghosh ne EPFO, ESIC, NPS or GPF main panjikaran ke aankadon ke aadhaar par daawa kiya tha ki 2017-18 main sangathit kshetra ke 70 lakh or asangathit kshetra main 80 lakh rojgaar srujit honge
 The Central Government has since claimed to fulfill its promise by citing these figures
 haalanki, in aankadon or in donon arthshaastriyon ke inhen hasil karne par vivaad ho rahaa he
 Around this, PM Modi had quoted 70 lakh jobs in a TV interview quoting the same figures and said that roadside pakoras sellers do not come in the list of registered jobs, but they are also earning money and families are raising money
 Have been
 aankadon par uthe the sawalupar bataae gaye do arthshaastriyon ke 70 lakh ke rojgaar ke aankadon par duusare arthshaastriyon ne sawaal uthaae the
 These include Jairam Ramesh, Praveen Chakraborty, former Finance Minister P
W
 chidambaram aadi shaamil the
 Chidambaram had said in an article that with the creation of 150 lakh jobs, there will be no problem of employment in the country in the coming days
 chidambaram ne kaha tha ki china kii jidipi bharat se paanch guna badi he or vah bhi saal main 150 lakh rojgaar hi de paati he to bharat main itane rojgaar kaa aankada sandehaaspad he
 Jairam Ramesh and Praveen Chakraborty had said that registration in EPFO means an unorganized employment coming into the organized sector and not new employment
 'bheekh maangane kaa rojgaar' se chidambaram nishane parachidambaram ne modi ke pakora vaale rojgaar ke bayaan ke baad twit kiya tha, 'pradhanmantri ne kaha ki pakora bechnaa bhi rojgaar he
 By that logic, begging is also employment
 chaliye jeene ke liye bheekh maangane ko majaboor garibon yaa viklangon ko bhi naukrishuda maan lete hai
 BJP president Amit Shah on Monday said on Chidambaram's statement that making pakodas is not a shame
 unhone kaha ki pakora bananaa nahin balki, pakora banane vaale kii tulana bhikhaari ke saath karnaa shame kii baat he
 Shah said that just as a tea seller has become the Prime Minister of the country, the son of a pakoda can also become something
 pehle 'chywala' piem par hua tha vivadaisase pehle bhi ek congressi netaa ke modi ko 'chaay bechney laayak' bataane vaale bayaan ko modi or bijepi ne apni pratishtha kaa sawaal bana liya tha
 Prior to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi was made the bjp's PM candidate
 iske baad janvari 2014 main congress ke adhiveshan main manishankar ayyar ne kaha tha, 'modi kaa piem bananaa mumkin nahin he, par vah chahen to congress adhiveshan main aakar chaay bech sakate hai
 'this matter was also made a question of prestige by BJP and Modi and since then Modi used to say in almost all public meetings that democracy has been confined to some families and some people do not want the tea seller (he himself) in the country Be the PM of modi 2013 se hi apni reliyon main kehete the, 'agar desh bechney vaala (congressi netaa) piem ban saktaa he to chaay bechney vaala kyon nahin?'chaay ke baad ban sakati he 'pakora ranneeti'manishankar ayyar ke chaiwale bayaan par hue vivaad ke baad bijepi ne iskaa khub milage liya tha
 In the Lok Sabha elections, several programs such as 'chai Chaat' were started
 kai shaharon par 1 rupee kii modi chaay bechi ja rahi thi
 This time on the target of BJP P
 chidambaram hai
 There is not much time left in the Lok Sabha elections and the assembly elections of eight states
 ho saktaa he ki aane vaale dinon main bijepi kii chunavi ranneeti main chaay ke baad pakora bhi shaamil ho jaaen
 India has missed the opportunity to host the world's largest telescope
 is baat ko lekar baari kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki 30 meter ke vishalkay telescope (tiamati) ko jammu-kashmir ke ladakh main atyadhik oonchai kaa sudur sthaan diya jayega
 Members of a multi-country coalition leading it decided this week that the telescope would be built on the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean
 varsh 2025 main sakriy hone vaale is telescope par do arab dollar se adhik kharch aayega
 Many people say that this was Prime Minister Narendra Modi's favorite project

 bharat sarkaar kii ek report main kaha gaya tha, tiamati ke jariye vaigyanik brahmad main dharti se behad dur ke pindon kaa adhyayan kar sakenge, jisase brahmad ke vikaas ke shuruaati charnon ke bare main jaankaree milti he

 These people said that the construction of the telescope violated a 'sacred site'
 varsh 2015 main adaalat ke aadesh ke chalate hawaii main telescope ke nirmaan ko vaishvik vaigyanik samudaay kii ichchhaaon ke vipareet roak diya gaya
 This created huge uncertainty

 Hanley, India, already has the world's highest optical telescope operated by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIAP), Bangalore
 iiapi kii pariyojna ke pramukh vaigyanik, professor eswar reddy ne kaha, haanaley ek acha sthaan he, lekin badhakaari hawaaon ke kaaran ek vishalkay telescope ko lagane ke lihaaj se kaaphi ooncha sthaan he
 Apart from this, some of the other reasons for snatching the hostel by Hanle are that its nearest port was in Mumbai and the road to Hanle is closed for several months due to heavy snow

 ) With the help of TMT, the largest optical and infrared telescope of the Northern Hemisphere, many discoveries will be made
 varsh 2024 main tiamati se pratispardhaa karne vaale 39 meter vyas ke ‘european extrimali large telescope’ ke chile main sthapit hone kii sambhaavna he
 The preferred place to install the TMT was Maua Kiya, a 4050-meter-high mountain in Hawaii, but petitions of protest were put up by local people in Hawaii's local courts
 in logon kaa kahana tha ki telescope ke nirmaan ne ek ‘pavitra sthal’ kaa ulanghan kiya he
 In 2015, a court order halted the creation of telescopes in Hawaii, contrary to the wishes of the global scientific community
 iske kaaran baari anischitata paidaa ho gai
 Since then, a search for a better alternative location started and Hanle, located at an altitude of 4500 meters in the extreme cold region of the Himalayas in India, was seriously considered
 bharat sthit haanaley main, indian institute of estrophijics (iiapi), bengalooru dwaara sanchalit vishwa kaa sabase ooncha prakaashiya telescope pehle se maujuud he
 The principal scientist of the IIAP project, Professor Eswar Reddy said, Hanley is a good location, but a much higher place to put a giant telescope on account of obstructive winds
 iske alaava haanaley ke haathon mejabani chhinane kii anya vajahon main se kuch vajahen is prakaar hai ki iskaa nikatatam bandargah mumbai main tha or haanaley tak sadak se jane kaa rasta kai maheene tak baari barf ke kaaran band rahata he
 Despite this, the Government of India had spread its arms to put the TMT project in India

 The comments iske tahat bhartiya vaigyanik prati varsh 25 se 30 raaton ke liye avlokan karenge

 america ke nae raashtrapati donald trump ne chunavi vaada kiya tha ki jeetne ke baad vah padosi desh mexico ke saath sate border par majboot wal banavaayenge
 Now Donald Trump is giving a hint of fulfilling this promise after taking over as President
 mexicon ke saath-saath duniyabar main sawaal khadaa ho rahaa he ki kya trump kii diwaar kaa antarrashtriya vyapaar par koi asar hoga? kya yah diwaar ek baar phir padosi mulkon ke saath rishton kii us puraani paribhaasha ko saamne rakh degaa jiske chalate itihaas main isse pehle bhi kai baar diwaar banane kii koshish kii gai he
 Let us know when and why there has been an attempt to build a border wall in the world before - The Great Waldonal Trump in China compared the border wall built on the Mexico border to the Great Wallse
 china main bani 13 hajaar mile kii lambaai vaali is wal kaa nirmaan teesri shatabdi main shuru hua or 14 veen se 17 shatabdi tak iskaa nirmaan ming dianasti ne karavaaya
 The purpose of building this wall was to protect China from neighboring Mongolian invasion
 lekin di great wal is makasad main safal nahin hui
 After the end of the Berlin World War II in Germany, Germany was divided into two parts
 communist prabhaav vaale east germany or loktantric prabhaav vaale west germany
 a decade after the war ended, East Germany built this wall in Berlin to prevent democratic influence from West Berlin from coming to the East
 96 mile lambii is wal ko 9 november 1989 main tod diya gaya jab east or west germany kaa ek baar uniphication ho gaya
 The Wall separating Ireland's Peace Volcathical and Protestant Christians was built in 1969 when the region was troubled by communal riots for a decade
 is wal ke banane ke baad bhi lagbhag teen dashak tak yah dange hote rahe
 Concrete walls, barbed wire were used on this wall made of steel and brick to prevent people from crossing
 2013 main north ireland ne 2023 tak is wal ko todane kaa prastaav diya tha lekin ab bhi is kshetra ke zyaadaatar logon kaa maananaa he ki wal ke tuutane ke baad ek baar phir dange vikaraal swaroop le sakate hai
 Israel has built a concrete wall built on the Gaza Strip and most areas of the West Bank border by Israel West Bank
 is wal kaa makasad philistin se aatanki hamale ko rokane kaa he
 However, internationally, this wall is condemned by Israel for building a wall for the purpose of seizing land
 is wal kaa nirmaan 2002 main shuru ho gaya tha or abhitak nirmaan kaam jari he
 Currently Israel has built 283 miles in the proposed 441 mile wall
 israel or misr kii border walisrael ne misr se apni sarhad ko surakshit karne ke liye 140 mile lambii or 15-20 feet unchi concreet pillar or katile taron kii wal banaai he
 The purpose of building this wall was to prevent illegal African immigration and smuggling of weapons into Israel via Egypt
 2012 main is wal kaa nirmaan shuru hua or iskaa nateeja yah rahaa ki jahaan 2011 main lagbhag 17,000gaiyrkanoonee imigrentsane sarhad paar kiya vahiin 2013 main mahaj 43 gaiyrkanoonee imigrents hi sarhad paar kar sake

 But do you know that Babita knew the correct answer to the last question of 7 crores? The question that Amitabh asked Babita for 7 crores was 'which state's highest governor has become the President of India?' The options were- Rajasthan, Bihar, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh
 The correct answer to this question was- Bihar
 babitha ne amitabh se kaha ki unhen sahi jawaab bihar lag rahaa he
 But then he decided to leave the show
 kyonki unhen apane jawaab ke sahi hone par bharosa nahin tha or unki sabhi lifelins khatm ho chuki thim
 Later Amitabh asked him to answer the question so that he could tell the public the correct answer
 jab babitha ne bihar jawaab diya tab amitabh ne bataaya ki ye jawaab bilkul sahi tha
 Babita had told Amitabh Bachchan during tha show that she does not like to strugle her husband
 iske alaava babitha ne ye bhi kaha tha ki ve inam main jiti dhanrashi ko khud istemaal nahin karengi balki apane parivaar ko de dengi

 ‘dambag’ bollywood star salmaan khan par kuch raajnneetik dalon kii bhrikutiyaan tan gai hai
 The reason is that he said during an interview with a TV channel in Pakistan that the Mumbai attacks were so inflated because the 'nobles were targeted

 Because of this people used to talk about them with juice
 pappu ram or unki patni ko is baat kaa pataa chalaa to unhone teenon ladakiyon kii shaadi duusare gaanv main tay kar di
 Pappu Ram stopped going to work and kept an eye on the daughters throughout the day

 But sex takes its way out, especially if it hits a young man's head
 papeeta kaa dharmendra se ishk tha jo pados ke dhancholi gaanv main 12veen kaa chaatr tha
 He alleges that Papaya incited him to kill his parents so that their love affair continues

 Dharmendra also brought intoxicating pills to make his parents unconscious, so that the lover-girlfriend could run away
 lekin vah yojana sire nahin chadh pai
 On June 17, Papaya called Dharmendra on his mobile and told him that the plan was in the works
 bhaavana ne apane pita or badi bahan ko neend kii goli khilaa di
 a little before midnight, Dharmendra came to the courtyard by closing the wall and unlocked the door of the room where Papaya and Bhavna were locked, so that they could see the murder of their parents
 papeeta kii maa shor sunakar uth baithi lekin papeeta uskaa galaa dabaane ke liye daudi
 Dharmendra attacked him with an ax and killed him
 iske baad police ko gumraah karne or dur ke ek chachaa par uski maa ke saath balaatkaar karne kii koshish karne kaa aarope lagane ke liye, unhone apane mata-pita ke kuch kapade utaar die taaki aisa lage ki koi un par tut padaa tha
 Both girls were under suspicion from the beginning
 kotputli ke atirikt police adheekshak vineet bansal kaa kahana he, ''donon ladkiyaan virodhabhasi bayaan de rahi thim
 Their telephone conversations were being monitored and this case was busted from here
 ''papeeta or dharmendra chup hai or is bare main kuch nahin bataa rahe hai ki bhaagane kii bajaae unhone mata-pita kii hatya kyon kii? bansal kaa kahana he, ''kaarvaas main maa-baap ladakiyon kii sud nahin lete, jisaki vajah se yah naubat ai
 Such sexual offenses are emerging as a new disaster for the police

 This session is going to last about a month

 The company launched it by targeting users who want to use a small smartphone
 ise jab bharat main launch kiya gaya to iskishuruaati keemat 39,999 rupee thijabaki iske 64GB vairient kii keemat 49,000 rupee thi
 It has been more or less a flop due to increased prices
 lekin ab isaki keemat 19,999 rupee ho gai he
 According to reports, this is a limited period offer and Rs 5000 is being given as cashback on purchases made by debit or credit card
 khabaron ke mutabik company ke othriced store par iphone SE kaa 16GB vairient 19,999 rupee main mil rahaa he

 Now look at the prices and look at other Android smartphones of this segment and if you want to get an iphone then this deal is definitely better
 kyonki iphone SE zyada purana nahin he or isamen diya gaya hardware iphone 6S jaisaa hi he jisaki keemat 40 hajaar se shuru hoti he
 There is only a difference between the iphone 6S and the iphone SE
 pehla ye kichifhone SE main 3D tach nahin diya gaya haior doosraa isaki screen choti he

 yani agar aapako ek aisa smartphone chahie jo compact ho chota ho to aise main yah deal aapke liye behatar sabit ho sakati he
 Because even though the iphone 5S is quite old, it is still sold in India
 iphone SE kaa 64GB vairient 25,999 rupee main mil rah he yani is keemat ke duusare android smartphone par baari pad saktaa he
 Because of the performance, design and camera, most of the Android smartphones of this segment are seen lagging behind

 This is the reason why the congress-jds is considering a new formula for Kumaraswamy's swearing-in on May 23
 kumaraswami ke aane se pehle hi dilli main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke ghar meeting hui
 Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ashok Gehlot and Venugopal participated in this meeting
 meeting ke baad gulam nabi aaazaad ne bataaya ki rahul gandhi or kumaraswami milakar cabinet par faisla lenge
 He also said that our mlas are together and we will prove majority in the House
 vahiin, sutron ke mutabik karnataka cabinet ko lekar nayaa formula banaaya ja rahaa he
 Under which, on Wednesday (may 23) Kokumaraswamy alone can take oath of Chief Minister
 ye bhi jaankaree he ki unke saath kuch mahatvapurn mantriyon ko shapath dilaai ja sakati he
 But the entire cabinet will be formed only after proving majority
 darasal, aisa isliye kiya ja rahaa he kyonkicabinetmen jagah na mil paane se kuch vidhayakon kii naaraazgi bhi saamne aa sakati he
 In such a situation, Congress and JDS do not want to take any risk
 isliye pehle donon partiyaan sadan ke patal par kumaraswami sarkaar kaa floor test paas karana chaahati hai or uske baad baaki mantriyon ko shapath dilaane kii yojana he
 It is being told that both the coalition parties are agreeing on this formula
 congress main cabinet ko lekar manthan ho chukaa he
 Now Kumaraswamy is reaching Delhi, who will meet Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi
 kumaraswami ke alaava karnataka congress ke netaa bhi aaj dilli main rahenge
 There are more reasons for fear! Apart from being displeased in the cabinet, there are other reasons besides the concern of the top leadership of Congress and JDS

 Former Karnataka Chief Minister SM Krishna finally called a press conference on Sunday and made a formal announcement to break his ties with the Congress party
 unhone bataaya ki upie-2 ke kaarykaal ke dauraan achaanak jis tarah se unhen videshmantri ke pad se hataaya vah tiraskaarpurn tha
 He worked with Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi
 kam se kam unhen bulaakar sammanjanak tareeke se vidaai di ja sakati thi jo ki hua nahin
 He was very disappointed with this
 shanivaar ko krishna ne congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko patr likhakar bataaya tha ki vah party chhodana chaahate hai
 After the cabinet expansion in 2016 last year, when the Congress rebellion against Chief Minister Siddaramaiah was in full swing, it is said that the Congress high command approached him so that the protest could be suppressed
 kehete hai ki tab krishna ne khud ko aage kar mukhyamantri ke taur par pesh karne kii koshish kii thi
 Since then, the gap between SM Krishna and the Congress central leadership had increased
 haalanki is khabar kii kabhi bhi esaem krishna kii taraf se pushti nahin kii gai
 Meanwhile, Krishna has also changed his name plate
 pehle krishna ke ant main sirf ek e hota tha ab uski jagah do e dikhe
 When asked, Krishna said that he had taken this step to "kicks" to jump the stairs of success
 tippaniyan Krishna was quite popular at one time, but at this age of 84 years, now he is weak in the changed political environment
 devegoda se unke nijee sambandh bahut bharosemand nahin hai, aise main bijepi se bhavishya main vah naata jodenge aisa mana ja rahaa he
 Even though SM Krishna's hold on the Vokaligga voters is not as strong as it was before, but in almost half a dozen assembly constituencies in the Mysore Mandya region, he has a decisive role to play

 Pakistan scored 628 runs in their first innings to take a big lead of 296 runs, but with the help of Tamim (not out 138) and Imrul (not out 132), Bangladesh made strong moves towards the test draw by blurring Pakistani hopes

 The decision of a nine-judge bench in the case of putta-swamy v
 Union of India declared the right to privacy as a fundamental right
 atorni general ne aadhaar yojana kaa bachaav kiya jo desh ke harek bascindia ke liye yuidi kaa number or biomitric pahchaan yaa aaidi hasil karnaa jaruri banaati he
 The Attorney General argued that Indians do not have any right to privacy under the Constitution
 unki is daleel se adaalat main vakeelon or jajon sahit har koi stabdh rah gaya
 This argument was meant to push the privacy debate back more than 50 years
 zyaadaatar log yah maanakar chalate the ki niztaa ke bagaiyr abhivyakti kii aazaadee yaa adhikaar bhi nahin ho saktaa
 Privacy was believed to be the foundation of the right to protest and disagree

 This type of chaos is perhaps first seen in court
 mudda najuk tha kyonki iskaa taalluk ek purv jaj se tha jinke upar supreme court se apane haq main aadesh hasil karne main ek pratibandhit medical college kii madad karne ke liye bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaaya ja rahaa tha
 It was alleged that the former judge had demanded Rs 3 crore for a favorable court order
 jaiswal kii yachika par prashanth bhushan or dushyant dave ne alag-alag tarikhon par alag-alag peethon ke saamne paksh rakhaa, jo takneekee taur par bemauka ho saktaa tha, kyonki exiar main supreme court ke kisi jaj ke naam kaa zikr nahin tha
 But the question was whether it was equivalent to dissolving the integrity of the Supreme Court as an institution? We must remember that firs cannot be lodged against any judge of the Supreme Court or High Court without the permission of the Chief Justice concerned
 takneekee taur par hi maamle ko ek peeth vishesh ko saunpane ko lekar pradhan nyaayadhish ke prashasnic paksh ke bich hiton kaa koi takaraav nahin tha
 Therefore, the request to withdraw from the case was justified
 magar hamen yaad rakhana hoga ki ek jaj ko hameshaa andeh se upar hona hi chahie
 Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate has registered a case of money laundering on the basis of the same FIR
 is vivaad ne jajon ke khilaaf shikayaton se nibatane ke liye ek saansthanik vyavastha kii jarurat par jor diya
 Judicial accountability is a precondition for independence of the judiciary
 nyaaypalika ne supreme court or tamaam hycourt main jajon kii niunnti ko lekar jari abhootpurv gatirodh kaa najaara dekha
 This problem was created to some extent by the bench that quashed the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), but on the other hand it also directed that the new Memorandum of Procedure in consultation with the Supreme Court Collegium, Ministry of Law and Justice (mop)

 The judiciary is already burdened with pending litigations, with 40-50 per cent vacant positions of judges at all levels, from the Supreme Court to the subordinate courts, making it even more difficult and complicated
 ummid he ki sarkaar is baat ko samajhegi ki baari taadaad main sweekrut padon ko khaali rakhkar nyaay se samjhauta nahin kiya ja saktaa, khaskar tab jab jajon ke sweekrut padon ko doguna karne kii maang ho rahi ho

 Due to the current deadlock, the lawsuits will be hanging for much longer and the possibility of speedy justice will be more deceitful

 Sometimes, the unfortunate accused have spent the entire length of the sentence in jail waiting for the disposal of the case, when they decide to go innocent or guilty
 supreme court ne kai maukon par kaha he ki kai janhit yachikaayen kanoonee prakriya kaa durupyog karti pai gai hai
 This wastes the time of the court, which is like a crime, because the trial of the cases hangs for many more years

 Public interest litigation should be taken in the remaining time after the disposal of the cases
 agast 2017 main supreme court ne shaayara bano banaam bharat sarkaar or anya ke cese main teen talaak kii pratha ko gaiyr-islamic or asanvaidhanik qaraar diya
 In the majority judgment, the court said that since the triple talaq comes into force at the same time and cannot be overturned, there is no scope for reconciliation between Shauhar and Biwi through two intermediaries of their families
 adaalat ne kaha ki teen talaak jis tarah prachlit he, usamen agar yah kisi jaij vajah se na diya gaya ho, tab bhi vaid mana jaataa he
 So it is arbitrary, because no Muslim man can break the bond of nikah arbitrarily without trying to reconcile
 is tarah teen talaak asanvaidhanik or samvidhan ke anuchhed 14 ke tahat die gaye samanta ke adhikaar kaa ullandhan he
 The government went ahead, calling the Muslim Women (protection of Rights of Marriage) Bill 2017, in the Lok Sabha in winter session, to declare null and unlawful the granting of a divorce to a person's wife in written or written form or in electronic form

 Another issue that the Supreme Court may face in the near future is whether women can also be guilty of adultery or criminal acts
 pichley 158 saal se ipisi kii dhara 497 purush ko vyabhichaari yani parastrigaman karne vaala or shaadishuda aurat ko iskaa shikaar maanati ai he, jab tak ki us aurat ke shuhar ne bivi or duusare aadmi ke bich vivahetar yon rishte kii manjuuri na di ho
 Adultery has been declared a crime in the West
 do vayaskon ke bich rajamandi se yon sambandh ko ab nijee maamla mana jaataa he or sarkarein naitik paharedaari se dur rahakar asli aparaadhon par dhyaan detii hai
 Clearly, the Supreme Court will consider the matter in depth and then decide whether adultery is made a non-crime, or if it is maintained a crime, the woman will be equally guilty

 police kii giraftaar ke dar se faraar hue bahubali netaa or nirdaleey vidhayak anant singh ne ravivaar raat ek video jari kiya he
 In this, he said that he will surrender before the court in the next 3 to 4 days
 anant singh ne kaha ki wo giraftaar ke dar se bhaage nahin hai, balki apane biimaar dost ko dekhne ke liye kisi jagah gaye hai
 In fact, on Saturday night, a team of Patna Police reached their Patna residence to arrest Bahubali MLA Anant Singh, but it was caught by Anant Singh and he escaped from there
 isse pehle shuukravaar ko patna police ne anant singh ke paitruk gaanv ladama main unke ghar par chhapamari kii thi, jahaan se ek eke-47, 22 jinda kaartoos or do bam baraamad hue the
 Following the recovery of AK-47 from Anant Singh's ancestral house, the police registered an FIR under the Unlawful Activities (prevention) Act and reached his Patna residence on Saturday night to arrest him
 video main anant singh ne apane ghar se eke-47 kii baramadagi ko police kii sajeesh bataaya he
 He defended himself saying that he has not been to his ancestral residence for the last 14 years and there is no question of hiding the AK-47 there
 anant singh ne aarope lagaaya ki adishnal espi lipi singh ne hi unhen fansaane ke liye unke ghar par eke-47 rakhwaya
 In the video, Anant Singh said that he also sought time to meet Chief Minister Nitish Kumar so that he could present his stand, but he did not get time
 anant singh ne kaha ki unhen nyaayalay par puraa bharosa he
 Space travel is becoming cheaper than before, and now private US companies have crew modules through which they are preparing to take humans for a walk in space
 lekin is tarakkee se judaa ek sawaal bhi he, jo visheshgyon ko lagaataar pareshaan kar rahaa he ki jab aaj nahin to kal, antariksh main insaanon kii basti ko hakeekat ban hi janaa he, to gurutvkarshan ke bina dheron radiation vaale us 'dushman' vaataavaran main insaan sex kaise kar paaegaa
 Now India too is preparing to send mankind to space with 'gaganyaan', and America is going to send astronauts through private rockets, because man is now planning to settle on the planets (satellites) in space
 , Then it has become necessary to seek answers to the questions related to maintaining human life
 is vivaadaaspad sawaal ko lekar hamane baat kii general charles bolden se, jo chaar antariksh abhiyaanon se jude rahe hai, or aath saal tak NASA ke pramukh rah chuke hai
 At this time General Charles Bolden is visiting India to promote indo-us space cooperation
 NDTV ke science editor pallav bagala ne NASA ke purv pramukh, diggaj antariksh yatri tathaa maujuuda samay main america ke antariksh maamalon ke vigyaan doot se inhen sawaalon ke jawaab hasil karne kii koshish kii, ki insaan gurutvkarshan ke bina antariksh main sex kaise kar paaegaa, yaa bachche kaise paidaa karegaa
 As far as i know, i don't think much research has been done on the issue of how this will happen, because it is exactly the same as going to the bathroom in space
 
 
 ham koi nai chiz ijad nahin karte hai, sach yahi he ki kru micro-gravity main rahata he, or isiilie unhen khud ko sthir rakhana sabase zaruri he
 
 
 We put small handles on the side of the toilet, rotate them, that's all
 
 
 ve spring-loded hote hai, or aapaki jaangh par tike rahete hai
 
 
 You can do something similar, which you do there
 
 
 jab aap bathroom jate hai, ham ek fain system kii madad se sacshan paidaa karte hai, jo ek bahut chote vaikum clinar jaisaa hota he
 
 
 We get into the situations in which we live
 
 
 dharti par ham jo kuch bhi kar pate hai, use antariksh main karne se rokane yaa mushkil bana dene vaali baat he ki vahaan gurutvkarshan nahin hota
 
 
 But whenever it comes time to do something, people find a way out
 
 
 is tarah kii afvaahen aksar udati rahi hai ki international spes stesan (ISS) main antariksh yatri sex karte rahe hai, lekin aadhikarik rup se NASA hameshaa iskaa khandan karata rahaa he
 The ISS is a lab built at a cost of billions of dollars that constantly revolves around the Earth, and in which humans have been present at all times
 ISS pichley 18 saal se dharti kii nichali kaksha main chakkar kaat rahaa he
 Dr
 Michael R
, an airspace physician and NASA astronaut
 barat kaa kahana he ki aajkal chune jane vaale adhiktar antariksh yatri kaaphi paripakv log hote hai, jo kathin paristhitiyon main shant rahanaa jaanate hai
 Barrett also says that conceiving and pregnancy in a gravity-free space should not happen at all, because we do not yet fully understand biology
 lekin barat ke anusaar, sabase badi chunauti he "ucch radiation ke sampark main gairzaruri rup se rahanaa, jab koi dharti ke surakshakvach se baahar hota he
 
 
 "actually, the Earth provides us with an ideal 'goldilocks environment' that supports life
 in sawaalon ke alaava general charles bolden kaa maananaa he ki ek bhartiya yuvak yaa yuvati ko sriharikota se antariksh main bhejne kaa bharat kaa sapana puraa hone kii kaaphi sambhaavna he
 President of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Dr
 K
 sivan ne 'gaganyan mishan' ke bare main kaha ki 'jab nikat bhavishya main antariksh main maujuud grahon-upgrahon par insaani basti banengi hi, to bharat bhi peeche nahin rahanaa chahta he
 
 
 It is expected that ISRO will now be working on human biology at double the speed, because even though they make fantastic rockets and satellites, they have not been as strong in the field of human biology yet
 bharat jo satellite or antariksh yaan banaata he, maanav antariksh main jaakar basane ke liye shartiya unheen kaa istemaal karegaa, lekin antariksh main pahunchakar vah bachche kaise paidaa kar paaegaa, yah ab bhi ek anuttarit sawaal he

 hathin seat se basapa ne taiyab hossain ko diya tikat2016 main naaballig ladki se rape kaa he aropadesh kii rajnatik party apni safagoi ke kitne bhi daawey karen, lekin chunaav aate hi wo apana asli rang dikhaanaa shuru kar dete hai
 In Haryana, different political parties have given tickets to many such candidates, who have cases registered in very serious streams
 aise hi hai haryana ke palaval jile kii hathin seat se bispi ummidavaar taiyab hossain
 In 2016, a case of raping a minor girl was reported on Tyab, who is considered to be Bahubali
 us vakt bhi isko lekar kaaphi bavaal machaa tha, haalanki apane bahubal se taiyab hossain ne is maamle ko puri tarah se dabaane kii koshish kii, lekin ladki kaa parivaar tamaam dhamkiyon ke baavjood bhi peeche nahin hataa or court main apane bayanon par kaayam rahaa
 Meanwhile, once Tayeb Hussain's family recorded his statement in court and tried to kidnap the returning minor
 jab police ne inako rokane kii koshish kii to taiyab ke parivaar ne pulisavaalon ke saath bhi marpet kii
 Order to collect DNA sample of Tayeb uskaa vajan bahut zyada yani kareeb 120 kilo tha or padhai main ausat thi
 Parents used to keep busy in their business and always ask them to lose weight
 dilli ke ek skool main 11veen class kii yah chaatra apni padhai or maa-baap se din-raat milti jhidakiyon se ukta chuki thi
 She was also the most isolated and cut off at school
 shuru main fasebuk or instagram ne uskaa man lagaae rakhaa, lekin jaldi hi unase bhi man bhar gaya
 Going deeper into the online world, he opened a separate account on his favorite social media site with a different email id, uploaded his groomed photo and started chatting with strangers
 internet ke alag brahmad main vah behad lokapriy ho gai
 She now has four boyfriends in her first year of college
 ye chaaron vivaahit purush use online mili
 She talks with her boyfriends on foreplay
 vah unase shaareerik sambandh banane kii kriya ke bare main puri jaankaree leti he or un saare vivaranon ko sunakar hastmaithun karti he
 Now his inner being is somewhat satisfied
 use dusron se sweekruti chahie thi
 Her boyfriend was approving of her sexy avatar
 unhen uski asaliyat jaanane kii jarurat nahin thi
 She was still alone in real life
 kishoron kii rahasyamay duniya or unki online aadaton par sarsari najar daalate hi unki ummiido or sapanom, bhay or ashankaon, aakankshaon or asurakshaon kaa internet par khulaa khel dikhaai detaa he
 Many teenagers India Today spoke to defied the untold need for approval
 unki kahaniyon main ek ajeeb kism kii karunaa he
 The story of their online sex experiments is also similar
 anek kishoron ke liye internet prayog karne or anjaan duniya ko tatolane kii prayogshaala he
 Today technology dominates every aspect of our life, tinder, hike, match
 com, planti of fish, okecupid jaise anek dating ap or whatsap tathaa vibar jaise chouting or video shering ap muft uplabdh hai
 "technology, including the Internet and mobile media, is part of the daily lives of many teens," says Suzanna Stern, professor of communication studies at the University of San Diego
 isliye yah swaabhaavik he ki technology ke sahare ve sexuality kii duniya ko tatolte hai
 "snapchat" is a picture sharing mobile app that erases the message / picture you send within ten seconds of receiving it
 aise mobile eps ne sexting yaa mobile or / yaa soshal media ke jariye sex se judi tasviren / baaten bhejnaa aasaan kar diya he or inamen jokhim bhi kam he (vaise ek or ap snapsev se aap snapchet kii tasviren seve kar sakate hai)
 For some teenagers like Arnav (name changed) studying at Amity University in Noida, this is even more cool
 unka kahana he ki garlfriend ke saath sexting karnaa khud ko ‘‘khatarnaak or sexi’’ dikhaane kaa tarika he
 Today most teenagers want both these qualities
 lekin bahut kam isaki khamiyaan dekh pate hai
 Especially when they are dealing with peers rather than strangers
 apane boyfriend ke 16wein janmdin par anitha (badla hua naam) ne use sarprise uphaar ke rup main apni nagn tasviren bhejne kaa faisla kiya
 He was very happy to get the photos, but after a few months, their friendship broke up
 chot khaae dil main badla lene or use waapas paane kii aag jalane lagi
 This class 10th student of a prestigious school in Delhi suddenly had a tremendous weapon in her hand - those pictures she did not erase from her phone
 ab vah in tasveeron se use blackmel karnaa chahta he
 So do teenagers also know what dangers they are playing? Does Anita know that her boyfriend can blackmail her with her photos? Does the boy know that if he has got nude photos then he can be convicted according to Indian law? Perhaps this is where the role of parents begins
 dilli main counselling psychologist gitanjali kumaar ke anusaar, ‘‘mata-pita ko is baat se hairaan nahin hona chahie ki kishor sexting karte hai, balki kishor ke sexting main lipt hone se pehle hi ve isaki chahat or sambhavit nateezon ke bare main uske saath sarthak charchaa kar sakate hai
 According to Richard Guerry, executive director of the Institute for Responsible Online and Cellphone Communication, "the real thing is that there has to be a constant dialogue about being responsible and not doing something that doesn't deserve to be public or permanent
" ’’bharat main apane bacchon ke saath sex ke bare main baat karnaa aaj bhi ajeeb mana jaataa he, to mata-pita is nae saanskrithik dharaatal par kadam kaise badhayen? dilli kii rahane vaali 14 saal ke bete kii maa shalini seth kahati hai ki ve bete ko khud hi is bare main khojbin karne dengi
 His question is, "wouldn't it look strange?" i can't talk to her about it
 ’’ lekin dilli public skool, aar
 K
 puram main padhaane vaali ek kishor bete kii maa sohini chakravarti ne us par najar rakhane ke apratyaksh tareeke nikaal liye hai
 The son who uses a computer, once in a while, he tries to see if he is on the right track
 stern kaa kahana he ki sexuality ke bare main baat karnaa ajeeb ho saktaa he, ‘‘lekin kyonki ham sab maanate hai ki vah ajeeb hoga
 The sooner parents start talking about sexuality in the child's life, the more comfortable and less awkward this conversation will be as the child grows up
 ’’ stern kaa maananaa he, ‘‘research se pataa chalaa he ki sex ke bare main baat karne kaa matlab yah nahin he ki kishoron ke sex main lipt hone kii sambhaavna bad jaati he, balki unhen apane saathiyon or media kii bajaae adhik sarthak or sateek soochna mil paati he
 "according to CBSE counselor and psychologist Naveen Kumar," If it was five years ago, we would have cut internet connection at home
 ab smartphone ke yug main hamen is samasya ko sanbhaalanaa siikhnaa hoga
 i think we should get bigger and smarter about it now
 ’’is bich, yah sach he ki vah moti ladki ab bhi online hogi or apane vaikalpik brahmad main raahat tatol rahi hogi
 Social activist Aruna Rai wrote a letter to UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi on Thursday demanding her support for ending her fast in view of the declining health of Medha Patkar who was on hunger strike in protest against the demolition of slums in Mumbai
 aruna ne sonia ko jo patr likhaa he, vah media main saarvajanik kiya gaya he
 In the letter, Aruna wrote, 'I want to reiterate the inevitability of this issue
 loktantric aavashyaktaa ke saath-saath medha ke girte swasthya ko dekhakar bhi is maamle main aapke hastkshep kaa anurodh karti hum
 According to Aruna, Union Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation Minister Ajay Maken has requested Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan to intervene in the matter and ensure that the slum is not evacuated
 sonia ko likhe patr main aruna ne yah bhi kaha he ki unhone maharashtra ke mukhyamantri ko bhi patr likhakar 'ghar bachaao andolan' ke saath jald baatcheet shuru karne kaa anurodh kiya he
 In the letter, he has also said that demolition of slums is against the policy of the Central Government not to forcibly evacuate the slum and this will also tarnish the upa's image of being with the 'common man'
 medha mumbai ke golibar ilaake main jhuggi basti giraae jane ke virodh main anshan par baithi hai
 His fast entered the eighth day on Thursday
 is tarah kii khabaren aa rahi hai ki unka swasthya gir rahaa he

 He also spoke on air pollution concerns in North India and said that Punjab cannot be solely held responsible for Delhi's pollution, as the Delhi government is doing
 chuninda ansh:- guru nanak dev ji ke 550wein jayanti samaaroh ko yaadgaar banane ke liye punjab sarkaar kya kar rahi he?do baaten
 We have started preparing for the celebrations
 apni taraf se ham koi kasar nahin baaki rakhane vaale kyonki hamaare liye guru nanak dev ji se bada kuch bhi nahin
 In Sultanpur Lodhi, where he stayed for a long time, we have done a lot of reform work
 lagbhag 35,000 tirthayatriyon ke aane kii sambhaavna he or hamane vahaan unke thaharne ke liye shivi banaae hai
 a total of 66 havens are being built for langar
 kaali bei nadi ke upar paanch nae pul banaae gaye hai or sadakon ko rashtriya rajmarg ke mandandon ke anuroop chaudaa kiya ja chukaa he
 So in this way we have done a very good job
 or phir deraa baba nanak main, hamane badi sankhya main tirthayatriyon se milane kaa intjaam kiya he jo utsav ke liye vahaan aaenge
 The work of Kartarpur corridor from our side is now complete
 or mujhe bataaya gaya he ki pakistan ne bhi apane hisse main kaam puraa kar liya he
 So now let's look forward
 main pehle din vahaan jane kii khwaahish rakhata hum
 - There are some differences between the Congress government and the Akali Dal in Punjab regarding the celebrations
 kya aap is mudde par akali dal or gurudwaron kii sheersh sanstha shiromani gurudwara prabandhak cameti (esajipisi) ke nazariye se naakhush hai?haa, aisa hi samajhie
 You already know that if there is a celebration related to a person like Guru Nanak, then the government has been organizing it
 masalan, guru govind singh ji ke samaaroh ke dauraan bhi aisa hi kiya gaya tha
 The state government made all the arrangements
 koi masalaa hi nahin tha
 i don't know why they are causing problems right now? The message of Guru Sahib was of unity and harmony
 main unhen pehle din se kah rahaa hum ki kam se kam is maukey par, sikh birdari or desh ke vyapak hit main ekta dikhaaen
 - What is the significance of Kartarpur corridor and will it become a corridor of peace? i look at it in two ways
 pehla to ek sikh ke rup main
 And i am very happy that this work has been done
 1920 ke dashak main kartarpur sahib gurudwara baadh se tabah ho gaya tha, tab mere dada [patiala ke maharaja bhupinder singh] ne iskaa punarnirmaan karaayaa
 In such a situation, for me, it is a pilgrimage to go through history
 har sikh aaj isiilie khush he
 But i also have my thoughts about the intention of Pakistan
 70 saal ho gaye
 Till now why have they not thought about connecting the Kartarpur corridor? Why did he not think of building Baba Guru Nanak University first? i think it is an ISI operation
 aap yaad kiijie, navajotisingh siddhu ko pakistan ke pradhanmantri ke rup main imran khan ke shapath grahan samaaroh ke liye bulaayaa gaya tha or shapath grahan se pehle hi general bajva [pakistani sena pramukh] ne siddhu ko suchit kar diya tha ki unhen yah jaanakar khushi hogi ki ve galiyara khol rahe hai
 That is, the army had already prepared the ground for this and whenever they do something like this, my ears stand up
 - bhartiya khufia agenciyon kii report he ki kartarpur ke paas ek ugravadi shivi sthapit kiya ja rahaa he yaa sthapit kiya ja chukaa he or yah iesai ne kiya he
 Now i do not know about the camps there
 khufia agenciyon ko is bare main zyada khabar hogi
 But of course, in the last one or two years, since i have been in office, we have seen many incidents of infiltration
 meri sarkaar ne lagbhag 26 modul kaa bhandaphod kiya jab ve punjab main pravesh karne kii koshish kar rahe the
 We have jailed more than 120 people
 lagbhag 400 hathiyaar or vibhinn prakaar ke visphotak idhar aae hai
 These people are not coming here to celebrate Diwali; Obviously, they are coming under some conspiracy and as Chief Minister i have to monitor this
 - kya aap punjab main sikh ugravad ke phir se lautne ko lekar ashankit hai?nahin
 In fact, the ISI has launched the Sikh for Justice Program (justice Program with Sikhs) to support the demand for a separate Khalistan led by Avtar Singh Pannu and some others
 ve in chizon se punjab main sahanubhuti praapt karnaa chaahate hai taaki unka mishan [2020 tak ek sikh janamat sangrah] safal ho sake
 Secondly, they want to be able to build more cells in Punjab for their operations
 ye aisi chijen hai jinhen hamen dekhnaa he
 As i said, as a Sikh i am happy that i am going to Kartarpur, but as a Chief Minister i have to be vigilant and vigilant about what else can be the intention behind it? - Kartarpur Corridor What kind of precautions have you advised the Government of India to take in the context of the terrorists and the open movement of terrorists in Punjab? i do not think they will march in the corridor Will go by
 ve shartiya taur par punjab main apni napak gatividhiyon kaa samarthan karne ke liye maahaul banane kii koshish karne vaale hai
 Guru Nanak Devji's concern for the environment is well known
 lekin aaj ke sabase bade muddon main se ek he vartmaan main punjab main jalati paraali se dilli main badhata pradooshan
 And your government is being accused that you have done nothing to control it
 dekhie, pichley do saal main hamane kai kisaanon par aarope darj kiye hai or unhen dandit kiya he
 The High Court released them
 hamaare paas lagbhag 39 kisaan trade unionen hai, jo kisaanon ko jaakar yah bataati hai ki pichhali baar karrwai hui thi lekin usamen riyaayat mil gai isliye aapako ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin, aap jaisaa chaaho vaisaa karte raho
 Of course, we have punished the farmers again and have registered more and more cases, but sadly this is all happening on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, who said that "pawan Guru, Paani father , Mother Earth Mahat (hawa is our Guru, Water is our father and Earth is our mother)
 '' ab unki baton ko usee samudaay dwaara nazarandaaj kiya ja rahaa he jise unhone janm diya or mujhe nahin lagata ki yah thik he
 -when technology of uprooting the system is available, why is the Punjab government not adopting it so that it does not need to be burned in the fields? We should not forget that 70 percent of the farmers here have less than five acres of land and among them Less than two acres near half
 ye aise log hai jo tractaron ke istemaal kaa kharchaa nahin uthaa sakate
 That is why i have requested the Prime Minister that if they give us 100 rupees more per quintal (from the minimum support price of the purchased grain), then we can ensure that the farmers use tractors for tackling the straw
 agar aisa nahin hota he to kisaan apane parivaar kaa pet nahin bhar paaegaa
 -captain! Then what is the way? You know, the whole country is worried about it
 main ek baat kahuunga, ve punjab ko dosha dete rahete hai lekin agar aap pradooshan ke aankadon ko dekhen, to punjab ke aankade pichley saal kii tulana main 18 fisadi kam hue hai or tathy yah he ki pradooshan ke aankadon ke lihaaj se dilli kahin buree sthiti main he
 So where and how is that pollution coming from? This is coming from the millions of new cars that have hit the streets
 jo audyogic vikaas or nirmaan kaary chal rahaa he yah uskaa pradooshan he
 Mr
 (arvind) kejariwal ko ise rokna chahie
 - Do you hope that there will be a way out? You have to keep such an expectation because the situation is bad
 aap jaanate hai, maine pradhanmantri ko apni chitthee main likhaa he ki keval mukhyamantri ke rup main hi pradooshan ko rokna meri jimmedaari nahin he, balki mere bachche or naati-pote sabhi dilli main rahete hai, isliye mujhe unki bhi chintaa he
 Finally, since we are talking on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, i would like to know what place Guru Nanak Dev personally holds in your life and how much inspiration do you take from him? See, for me So he is the creator of this creation and the source of my faith
 mere liye ve kya myne rakhte hai
 
 
 i am unable to express it in words
 unki mahanata ke bare main kya kahuun, abhivyakti se pare hai
 One of his message we must remember is: 'no Hindu, no Muslim, all God forbid' - this is what India needs today
 thth''ve (dilli vaale) punjab ko dosha dete rahete hai par agar aap pradooshan ke aankade dekhen to pichley saal ke mukaable yah 18 fisadi gata he
 And the fact is that Delhi is far worse in terms of data
 vah pradooshan lakhon lakh nai kaaron, audyogic vikaas or nirmaan kaaryon se aa rahaa he
 '' *** bollywood actress prinyaka chopra ab film 'bharat' main nahin najar aaengi

 unhone likhaa, "haa, priyanka chopra ab 'bharat' kaa hissaa nahin hai
