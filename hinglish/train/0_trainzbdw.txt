 On 18 January 2009, a large businessman in Greater Kailash area of south Delhi got down from his new Honda Accord worth twenty five lakh and went to his friend's house
 dryver ne abhi gaadi park kii hi thi ki peeche se ek honda city bagal main aakar rukii
 Manoj Bakkarwala, who looted one, two, but not more than five hundred vehicles at gun point, suddenly threatened
 khauf kaa doosraa naam bakkarwalamanoj bakkarwaala dilli kii sadakon par khauf kaa doosraa naam he
 Like a dangerous shadow, Manoj Bakkarwala chases luxury cars on the streets of Delhi and can rob any such vehicle at gunpoint at any moment
 nai puraani har tarah kii lagjri gaadiyaan udaana uskaa shauk ban chukaa tha
 The police beard is that Bakkarwala never leaves a clue
 badi mushkil se police ke haath laga ek aisa suraag jo isaki nijee jindagi se judaa tha
 Watching the prized cars As soon as a new prized vehicle was launched in the market of Delhi, the car jacker Manoj Bakkarwala started plotting to grab it
 dilli ke kis posh ilaake main kitni lagjri gadiyaan hai gadiyon ke maalik kahaan aate-jate hai, or ye gadiyaan kahaan park hoti hai, in jaankariyon ko jutaney main bakkarwaale kaa shaayad hi koi sani ho
 For instance, a few weeks ago, on June 15, 2009, Bakkarwala's gang turned to Gurgaon, and as part of a pre-determined conspiracy to loot a new car in a showroom condition at a gun point
 gang ko police kaa khauf nahindilli kii sadakon se saream manhagi gadee luutane kii havas ne bakkarwaala ke gang ko bilkul bekhauf kar diya
 So fearless that every vehicle that looked at the vehicle at the point of the gun came to him in five minutes
 jis tareeke par bandook kii nonk par bakkarwaala gang gaadi luutata he usase kai gadee maalik itani dehshat main aa jate the ki unakon rapat likhaane main bhi dar lagata he
 Some of the people who were robbed, thanked that even though the car was robbed, it was good that they were not shot
 police ke liye pareshaani kaa sababudhar police bhi dilli main ho rahe is naye kism ke jurm se sakate main thi
 The top police officers started sitting down to throw a trap at this new king of crime and terror
 khaastaur par dilli police kii elite divijan special cell ko manoj bakkarwaala ko pakadaney ke jimmedaari di gayi
 Police surveillance was increased on expensive luxury vehicles originating from Delhi
 lekin kaaron kaa super jaikar jurm ko anjaam dene ke baad maukey par apana ek bhi nishaan nahin chodta he
 He is so vicious that he avoided mobile phones and banned his gang from talking on the phone
 haath aayaa ek nijee suragbakkarwaala or bhi bekhauf ho gaya
 Delhi and Delhi his gang started robbing cars at gunpoint in Chandigarh
 22 june 2009 ko chandigarh main pistaul dikhaakar bakkarwaala ek nayi honda acard uda kar le gaya
 While chasing this shadow of terror, a clue of Bakkarwala came to the police
 yah suraag tha model jaisi haseen si dikhne vaali uski mashooqa kaa, jo is khatarnaak gangster ke saath jeene marane kii kasame kha rahi thi
 Often meeting with Mehbooba Police finds that Bakkarwala is hanging out with her lover Mehbooba in a discotheque
 police ko ye bhi pataa laga ki bakkarwaala apni mahabuuba se aksar mulaakaat karata rahata he
 Despite the looming threat of the police, he takes his lover to Long Drive
 idhar police uski mahabuuba par najar gadaaye thi, lekin police ke jasoos ko jaanch ke is sire ko pakadte hi ek sansanikhej khabar mili
 a Delhi-based uniformed goon had joined this dangerous gang and this policeman was connected to another Punjab Police uniform
 in daagi vardiwaalon kii badaulat manoj bakkarwaala ne apana network dilli ke baahar duusare kai rajyon main failaa diya tha

 " RJD chief and former Union Minister Lalu Prasad accused Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of denying the views of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar in the name of Mahadalit
 patna ke shrikrishna memorial haal main rajd dwaara yojit ambedkar jayanti sah dalit ekta mahasammelan ko sambodhit karte hue lalu ne bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par aarope lagaaya ki unhone mahadalit ke naam par ambedkar ke vichaaron ko khandit karne kaa kaam kiya he
 Lalu said that Ambedkar had given the basic mantra to Dalits across the country to organize and fight unitedly, but Nitish has done the work of denouncing Mahadalit in his name
 rajd pramukh ne aarope lagaaya ki ek taraf nitish ambedkar kii jayanti manaate hai vahiin duusari taraf vyavhaarik rup se unka kriyalap daliton ke viruddh he
 He said that if Nitish had to uplift the people of the Dalit community, then what was the mistake of the people of Paswan (dusadh) community that he did not include all the other castes by joining them in Mahadalit
 bhagwaan buddha ke ‘buddham sharanam gachhami, sangham sharanam gachhami’ upadesh kaa zikr karte hue is samudaay ke logon se budhimaan evam chatur banane or apni ekta ko majboot karne kaa kaha
 Lalu said that the assembly election in Bihar is imminent and at such times various kinds of inducements will be given to them by different parties and work will be done to break them but they should be firm in principles and do not fall into their temptation
 lalu ne mahila aarakshan bill ko ek sajeesh bataate hue kaha ki teen chunaav ke baad ek bhi majboot purush pratyaashiyon ke liye ek bhi seat nahin bachegaa
 He said that he does not oppose the Women's Reservation Bill but is opposing its present form
 rajd pramukh ne kaha ki mahilaon ko 50 athwa 70 pratishat tak aarakshan de diya jaae usamen unhen aapatti nahin he lekin vah usamen muslim dalit pichhade evam atyant pichde varg kii yuvatiyon kaa pratinidhitiv chaahate hai
 Lalu said that reservation is given to such people of the society who cannot reach the house from their level
 waisi mahilaon ke liye mahila aarakshan bill main praavdhaan kiya jaae, unki party uskaa samarthan karegi
 Describing the Bihar government as a failure on every front, the RJD chief claimed that thousands of people died of hunger in the state, but the government here could not even lift 40 percent of the food grains allocated by the Center to BPL families
 unhone bataaya ki pradesh main lagaataar ghat rahi agalgi kii ghatnaon kaa zikr karte hue lalu ne pradesh main paryaapt sankhya main agnishman vibhaag ke damakalon kaa abhaav bataaya
 Lalu said that in this summer season where people do not have drinking water, the poor are not getting food grains to extinguish stomach fire
 lalu ne kaha ki ek to pradesh main mazdooron ko pradhanmantri gram sadak yojana ke tahat kaam nahin mil rahaa he
 If in some way they earn some money by doing wages, then the liquor shops in the village are being offered to him by the state government and due to which there is increasing domestic discord in the villages
 unhone kaha ki bihar main sharaab theka aavanton main jab ghotaalaa hone kii baat vibhageeya mantri ne uthaai to pradesh ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne uski sibiai se jaanch karaane se inkaar kar diya
 Lalu said that the state government's assurance to provide three dismantled land for construction of housing to the people of Mahadalit community was a sham and said that during the tenure of his government it was decided to provide land for housing to all such landless villagers
 Was
 unhone kaha ki chand logon ko khush karne ke liye vartmaan rajya sarkaar ne ceiling kii seemaa ko khatm kar shahari ilaake main garibon ko rojgaar ke liye bhoomi die jane ke unki sarkaar ke nirnay ko ulat diya
 Accusing Bihar's Nitish government of collapsing education, it said that it has appointed teachers who cannot provide quality education to children in this competitive era
 sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue lojpa pramukh or purv kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ne kaha ki dalit samudaay ke logon ko yah samajhnaa hoga ki mahadalit ke naam par jo roti kaa tukdaa pradesh sarkaar dene kii baat kar rahi he vah ek chhalaava he
 Paswan said that the people of this society have to understand who is their real benefactor because the state government is trying to break the unity of Mahadalit in their name
 nobel puraskaar 2017 kii ghoshnaa shuru ho gai he

 yahi vajah he ki america is maamle main china ke role par jor de rahaa he
 Trump himself also lured China into expanding trade
 magar china abhi dur se hi tamaasha dekhne kii niti apana rahaa he
 However, China itself wants to solve this problem peacefully
 kyonki wo jaanata he ki jang ke halaat main use kai tarah kii dikkaton se do-chaar hona padegaa
 And the biggest problem will be North Korean refugees
 jo jang chhidane par japan or south korea na jaakar sirf china kaa ruukh karenge
 If the US attacks North Korea, it may have to take it because China will have to support North Korea in any event of war
 aisa isliye kyonki america or north korea donon ke ek saath china kii sandhiyaan hai
 China and Russia supported North Korea in the war between North and South Korea from 1950 to 1953
 jiske baad yuan kii madhyasthata main hui ek yudhviram sandhi ke saath hi ye jang khatm hui thi
 During the treaty, an agreement was also reached between Washington and Beijing that if the US attacked North Korea in the future, the cease fire would break
 iske alaava 1961 main china or uttar korea kii vampanthi sarkaron ne aapas main ek or ahm sandhi kii thi
 It was named as 'china-north Korean Mutual Assistance and Cooperation Friendship Treaty'
 is sandhi main kaha gaya he ki agar china or north korea main se kisi bhi desh par agar koi doosraa desh hamalaa karata he, to donon deshon ko turant ek-duusare kaa sahyog karnaa padegaa
 In the past years, these two countries have extended the validity period of this treaty to 2021
 videsh maamalon ke kuch jaankaar kehete hai ki is sandhi se donon deshon ko bada phayda mila he
 While China made its business interests with it, North Korea managed to secure itself further by making this treaty
 aarthik najariye se bhi china ke liye north korea bahut zyada ahm he
 For the last four decades, the North Korean market has a Chinese reputation
 iske alaava america senaaon kii is kshetra main maujuudagi ne bhi china ko pareshaan kar rakhaa he or isiilie wo jald is samasya ko hal karnaa chahta he
 China is constantly trying to somehow end the situation of war
 isiilie chini videsh mantri ne america or uttar korea donon ko hi chetate hue kaha tha ki agar yuddh hua to usamen jeet kisi kii nahin hogi jabaki donon ko kabhi na dur hone vaale jakhm jhelane pad sakate hai
 But now in China, there is a buzz about what will be the role of China in the event of war
 
 According to the official newspaper Global Times, China should not remain silent if the United States attacks North Korea with the intention of changing power
 bhartiya mul ke lekhak salmaan rushdi ne chintaa vyakt kii he ki bharat main narendra modi ke netritv main jo sarkaar banegi vah ek ‘pareshaan karne vaali’ sarkaar hogi or agar bijepi satta main aati he to desh main abhivyakti kii aazaadee kaa haal pehle se badtar ho saktaa he
 During a session focused on the importance of freedom of expression in the tenth annual 'penn World Voice Fascital' on New York, Rushdie said, "I am very concerned about Narendra Modi's government
" aise sanket milane lage hai ki yah ek pareshaan karne vaali sarkaar hogi
 We see that journalists and writers are harassed despite (BJP) not gaining power yet
 ' He expressed his views on India being formed under Modi's leadership and said, 'you have seen that there is a kind of disturbing censorship, people are worried that they are being harassed and hence try not to do something Due to which he had to face the wrath of 'modi supporters'
 ' Rushdie said that there has never been a politician like Narendra Modi in India and he said that BJP is more likely to win the Lok Sabha elections and Modi will become the next Prime Minister and 'we have to see how liberal the Prime Minister's post makes him
 ' During his literary address at the festival, Rushdie called Modi a 'very divisive figure' and a 'fanatic of fanatics' and expressed concern that freedom of expression and attacks on literary work would intensify in bjp-ruled India

 Therefore, the voice from leh-ladakh used to get lost while coming to Delhi

 Now hopefully we will be well ladakh kii muraad to puri ho gai he, ab vakt he uske sapanom ko puraa karne kaa
 Expectations of development and employment
 Ladakhis believe that after getting Union Territory status, industries will come here and this will increase the source of earning

 There is a plan to invest Rs 45000 crore for this
 sarkaar kii yojana he ki saal 2023 tak is project ko puraa kar liya jaae

 The people of Ladakh want tribal status for themselves so that people from other parts of the country do not come and settle here
 is tarah se unhen ladakh kii janasankhyikee badalane kaa dar nahin rahegaa
 Due to the provisions of Article 370, no person outside Jammu and Kashmir was allowed to buy land in Ladakh
 2011 kii janaganana ke anusaar, leh or kargil kii 80 fisadi aabaadi or ladakh kii 90 pratishat aabaadi adivaasiyon kii he
 The people of Ladakh want this proportion of the population to remain intact
 padhein: ladakh hameshaa se chahta tha swaittata, ladata rahaa aazaadee ke lieparyton se phayda, magar paryaavaran kii chintaladakh kaa paryaavaran behad najuk he
 If the facilities are increased by becoming a union territory, then tourism will also increase, the income of its people will increase, but along with this, the concern is that the arrival of outsiders will have an impact on the environment
 haalanki ye chintaa abhi jaldi he, lekin inhen lagata he ki bade sailaaniyon kaa asar yahaan kii ichology par padegaa
 Lack of basic facilities, be it inaccessible geographical areas or ignored for years
 ladakh ke kuch ilaake aaj bhi moolbhoot suvidhaon ke liye jaddojahad kar rahe hai
 Junkar area of ladakh has not yet reached the facilities like electricity and phone, people here hope that their voice will be heard in the new regime
 yuva saansad kii charchaasansad main jab jammu-kashmir punargathan vidheyak par charchaa ho rahi thi to jis shaks ne apni ore sabakaa dhyaan khinchaa wo the ladakh se bijepi saansad jamyang sering namagyal

 unhone kaha ki saalon se upekshit padi janata ko ab vikaas kii jarurat he

 apane rajasthan daure par aae congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne udaipur main kaha ki pradhanmantri modi hindu kii baat karte hai magar hindutv ke bare main nahin jaanate hai

 When he first entered politics, there was an attempt to establish him as a secular person
 lekin jab vah baat raajnneeti fail ho gai to nae sire se unhen hindu bana kar pesh kiya gaya
 Rahul Gandhi could not succeed even by becoming a Brahmin, Sushma further said that when the talk was not being made, the Congress said that he should be clubbed with his maternal grandfather's caste and he was called a Brahmin by joining his maternal grandfather Nehru's caste
 yah to suna he ki dharm parivartan hota he lekin jati kaa parivartan kabhi nahin hota he
 But Rahul Gandhi could not succeed even by becoming a Brahmin, then it was thought again and he said that i am a Janeudhari Brahmin
 hindu banane kii koshish kii ja rahi hesushamaa ne rahul ke hindutv ke bare main kaha ki janeudhari brahman banane ke liye unhen jagah-jagah mandir ghumaya gaya
 Even a visit to Kailash Mansarovar was done by claiming Shankar as a devotee, but not very successful, then his grandfather's tribe was now discovered
 unhen kisi bhi tarah se hindu banane kii koshish kii ja rahi he or isi silsile main aaj unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi ko hi hindutv nahin samajhane kii baat kahi he
 God forbid we come at a time when we have to learn Hindutva from Rahul Gandhi

 The Congress's strategy of pressure also worked and if the real estate bill had to be sent to the Select Committee in the Rajya Sabha, the government seems to be putting the land acquisition bill on hold
 rahul ke badale tevar se sarkaar kitni pareshaan he, iskaa andaja isse lagaaya ja saktaa he ki sadan main jawaab dene ke liye teen se chaar mantri khadey ho jate the
 On the issue of farmers, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh gave a factual reply, which Modi himself later praised, but he could not politically beat Rahul
 net nutrality par sanchaar mantri ravishankar prasad bhi nijee tippanee se bache
 So Road and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari was forced to come to the House three days later with a written explanation
 duusari ore, bijepi kaa ek dhada is paksh main he ki rahul jis tarah modi sarkaar par nijee tippaniyan kar rahe hai, party ko bhi usee bhashaa main jawaab dena chahie
 The strategy of a Congress-rich India, but the BJP wants to take action by looking at the political gains and losses
 pradhanmantri modi ne loksabhaa chunaav se pehle congress mukt bharat kaa naaraa diya tha
 But the way politics has taken a turn within a year, BJP strategists have started to feel that it is beneficial for the party to stay in the Congress
 bijepi ke rashtriya pravaktaa or chunaav vishleshak jiviel narsingh raav kehete hai, ''jab ham congress ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaate hai to ham uski raajnneeti, vichaardhaara ko chunauti dete hai
 It is not that we want to end the Congress
 darasal, congress kii vajah se desh ko jo nuksaan hua he, ham uski baat karte hai
 "analysis of the Lok Sabha election data shows that in areas where BJP had a direct fight with Congress, the party's winning rate was 88 per cent and where regional parties fought 49 per cent
 rajnatik lihaaj se bijepi ke liye congress yukt bharat mufeed he
 Recently, the solidarity of the Janata Parivar has increased the difficulties of the party
 bijepi ko lagata he ki janata parivaar bihar main uske liye badi chunauti pesh karegaa
 Therefore, the party is eyeing people like rjd-ousted MP Pappu Yadav and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi
 bijepi kaa maananaa he ki janata parivaar main chunaav se pehle baari uthal-puthal hogi
 That is why the party prefers to give Rahul the message that the Congress is the only one to counter it
 bijepi ke ek padaadhikari kehete hai, ''modi ko maut kaa saudagar jaisi nakaaratmak tippaniyon ne hi hero banaaya, ham bhi waisi nijee tippanee kar rahul ko badhaava nahin denge
 But Rahul will be responded to with facts on policy issues
 " lekin rahul jis tarah se modi sarkaar par hamalavar hai, usne bijepi main jabardast khalabali to machaa hi di he

 Ever since Sheila Dikshit has been announced by the Congress as the Chief Ministerial candidate in UP, the entire electoral strategy of PM Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah has been destroyed
 upi chunaav main samaajawaadee party ke chehre mulaayam singh yadav or mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav honge to bahujan samaaj party sirf mayawati ke naam par chunaav ladegi to congress ne bhi is ladaai main apni bhaagedari dikhaane ke liye shila dikshit ko siem ummidavaar banakarabijepico pareshaani main daal diya he
 BJP PM Modi wanted to go to this Mahasamar of UP with face but now the matter is changing
 bijepi ke paas he ek hi bada cheharaa!asal main bijepi ke samasya ye he ki upi main vaise to party ke paas kai chahare hai jo mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar banaae ja sakate he lekin mulaayam singh yadav or mayawati ke chehre ke saamne bahut boune lagate hai
 The Congress has also fielded a big face Sheila Dixit, who has been the Chief Minister of Delhi for 15 years and has been a minister in the Union Government while being a Lok Sabha MP from Kannauj in UP
 bijepi ke paas sirf ek cheharaa he jo mulaayam singh yadav, mayawati or shila dikshit jaise bade chehron ko takkar de saktaa hai or wo hai rajnath singh
 But Rajnath Singh is not ready to be the face of the party in UP elections
 shila ke aane se kadaa ho gaya muqablarajanath singh ne piem modi or amit shah ko elahabaad main kaaryakaarani kii baithak se pehle saaf kar diya tha ki wo chunaav main party kaa cheharaa banakar upi kii raajnneeti main waapas nahin janaa chaahate he lekin shila dikshit ke aane se muqabla or bhi zyada kadaa ho gaya he isliye piem modi or amit shah chaahate hai ki rajnath singh ko upi kii campan cameti kaa chairman bana diya jaae
 Both these big leaders feel that the party will benefit from projecting Rajnath Singh as the biggest leader in UP elections without making him a face
 bijepi se naaraaz he upi kii janatarajanath singh upi kii raajnneeti ke puraane maahir khilaadi rahe hai
 Rajnath Singh knows that the atmosphere created for the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections is no longer there
 rajnath singh ke kareebi kehete hai ki bijepi ke saansadon ke prati janata main bahut zyada naaraazgi he or jis jatigat dhaanche par party ko khadaa kiya gaya he wo duusari partiyon ke saamne tik nahin paaegaa
 Many senior leaders are also angry with many decisions of the party, so winning the election will not be impossible

 Union Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Sunday denied enacting a law to punish hotels and restaurants in the country for imposing a service charge from consumers
 paswan ne kaha ki vivaadit mudde par sarkaar dwaara kanoon banane se pehle is mudde par paryaapt jaagrukta or logon dwaara isaki maang kii aavashyaktaa he
 He told the media here, "we have issued guidelines to inform consumers about their rights and that the service fee is voluntary
 hotel yaa restaraan ise anivaary nahin kar sakate
 It is up to a consumer whether he wants to pay it or not
 yadi main abhi kanoon par kuch kahuun to yah kaha jayega ki sarkaar dakhal de rahi he
 "also read: The government implicated the service charge option, learn how they said that hotels and restaurants should not understand that since the government does not (necessarily) bring the law, they can charge service charges
 unhone kaha ki yadi restaraan kehete hai ki ve apane weters ko seva shulk ke ek hisse kaa bhugtan karte hai to yah darj kiya janaa chahie or tex ritern main iskaa hisaab rakhaa janaa chahie
 He said, "if the consumer is obliged to pay the service fee then he can go to the consumer court
 "unhone kaha ki mantralay kaa iraadaa anuchit vyapaar tareekon ko lekar maamle par nae disha-nirdesh jari karnaa he, jisase upabhoktaaon ko seva shulk ko lekar unke adhikaron ko lekar jaagruk kiya ja sake
 Paswan said that under the Consumer Protection Act 1986 the consumer has the right to know the quantity of food and the price to be taken
 disha-nirdeshon ke mutabik, bill main saaf taur par likhaa hona chahie ki seva shulk svaichhik he or bill main seva shulk kaa kollam bhugtan karne se pehle upabhokta ke liye khaali hona chahie
 After evaluating the quality of service the consumer can decide whether to give a tip or not, and how much to give

 According to sources in the Gujarat ATS, Maulana called the murder as Wajib-e-slaughter
 jiskaa matlab hota he 'islam ke mutabik ye katl dharm kii raksha ke liye sahi tha'
 After justifying the murder, Maulan Mousin Sheikh also joined these people in this murder plot

 ATS Chief Himanshu Shukla told the entire incident of the murder, "moinuddin was injured on his fingers when he was arrested
 chot ke bare main jab poochtacha kii gai tab moinuddin ne aties ko bataaya ki jab ve log kamalesh tiwari kii hatya karne ke liye lakhanu ke daftar main gayi the
 At that time, Ashfaq first tried to cut Kamlesh Tiwari's throat by removing the knife
 kamalesh tiwarike chikhane par moinuddin ne uskaa galaa dabaa diya
 On further inquiry, they told that they attacked many parts of Kamlesh Tiwari's body
 isi bich ashfak ne kamalesh tiwari ke sar par firing kii
 But the bullet hit Kamlesh Tiwari near his mouth and piercing Moinuddin's finger
 moinuddin bhi kamalesh ko maarane ke liye chalaai goli se ghayal ho gaya
 Although Ashfaq himself was MR, he took the medicine from there and got a hand dressing

 The findings of OSINT showed that fortified efforts have been made to cover this location from the veil of secrecy
 international atomic energy association (IAEA) is lab ko ‘newclear technology kaa avaidh strot’ qaraar diya he
 It also described it as a 'serious threat to nuclear non-proliferation'
 india today kii OSINT team kii ore se hasil kii gai hai rijolution satellite tasveeron se pushti hoti he jis nai facility kaa nirmaan hua he wo kahuta main khan research leboratory kii puraani lab se mahaz 800 meter kii duuri par he
 a closer look at these pictures can be noted as how the piece of land that was vacant in 2014 has been converted into a potential nuclear centrifuge facility in 2019
 in ghaatak nai tasveeron ke peeche kaala ateet he
 Research by independent global think tanks has previously indicated that an under-construction structure is located at this location
 ‘da newclear threat initiative’ (NTI), jens or da institute for science and international security sahamat the ki us samay jo dhaancha ban rahaa tha, wo newclear centriphyus se miltaa julata tha
 Nuclear centrifuges refer to the facility where uranium is augmented to produce powerful fuel capable of making nuclear bombs
 kahuta centre par nirmaan jari tha, isliye fahrren wachdags kisi nattejey par nahin pahunche
 New satellite images obtained from India Today confirmed that the structure is spread over 6 hectares and is now fully ready
 iske chaaron or do meter moti boundry wal he
 Also, the roof has been made in such a way that the reality here is not revealed
 yani duniya se is facility ko chupa kar rakhane kii puri koshish kii gai he
 When these recent photographs were shown to retired Air Vice Marshal Sunil Nanodkar, he said, 'from the satellite photos i saw, his pre-existing intent was understood
 main samajhataa hum ki ye bahut hairaani vaala he ki antarrashtriya samudaay ne is par adhik aawaaj nahin kii
 This facility is being developed very close to that old facility in Kahuta, where Pakistan's nuclear capabilities are being hammered into the lab
 main samajhataa hum ki hamen ise saaf taur par dekhne kii zarurat he ki isaki kshamta kya hogi
 We know this is a nuclear facility
 ’diardio ke public interphes divijan ke purv nideshak ravi kumaar gupta bhi kuch aisi hi raay rakhte hai
 He says, "this shows that Pakistan is trying to expand its nuclear enrichment facility
" ham isaki andekhi nahin kar sakate kyonki ye khan research laboretory ke bilkul paas he
 The same place where Pakistan develops nuclear bombs and missiles
 aise main vishwa samudaay ko ise bahut gambhirtha se liya janaa chahie
 Pakistan also has a civil nuclear program which is running with the help of China
 lekin khan research facility IAEA ke vaishavik sefgards ke tahat nahin he
 When Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan is placing the responsibility of any future nuclear flashpoint on the global community, experts believe that it is time for the international community to intervene
 ritred air vaais marshall nanodakar kehete hai, “ye tasviren aapako iran or north korea kii facility ke kareeb le jaati hai
 If we say today that it is only Iran and North Korea and not Pakistan, then there is definitely something wrong
 main samajhataa hum ki ise hamen ise uthaanaa chahie
 We need to raise this in all international forums

 ) The Congress has retaliated on the CCTV statement of Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia
 dilli sarkaar ke purv mantri aravindar singh lavali or harun usuf ne kaha ki jo aam aadmi party bhrashtachar mitaane kii baat kiya karti thi unheen ke netritv vaali dilli sarkaar sisitivi camere ko lekar hue bhrashtachar se logon kaa dhyaan bhatakaane kii kushish kar rahi he
 Ajay Maken has alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party government has committed corruption in the project of installing CCTV cameras in Delhi and contracted the Chinese government company Hick Vision by the Indian government company Bell, putting the country's security at stake
 congress ne kaha ki dilli main sisitivi camera lagane ke project kii shuruaati laagat 130 karod thi jisko ki tender shartaan main chhot dekar 571
 40 crores, and when Hick Vision was added to Bell's vendor list, it was awarded to Tender Bell
 harun usuf ne kaha ki dilli main alibaba or 66 chor kii sarkaar he
 Lovely said that Sisodia was saying that the AAP party's Delhi government was ready to install CCTV cameras in Delhi yesterday and wanted to hand over the task to RWA, but in this task, the opposition parties and Delhi's Lieutenant Governor are stuck
 Which is a lie
 lavali ne kaha ki uparajyapal dwaara sisitivi camere ke mudde ko lekar banaai gai cameti se bhi aisa lagata he ki wo sisitivi camere ke bhrashtachar ke mudde ko badalanaa chaah rahe hai
 Arvinder Singh Lovely said that the Congress Party did not want a certificate from Manish Sisodia about how many works the Congress Government of Delhi had done in its tenure in 15 years
 unhone kaha ki congress ke kiye gaye vikaas kaaryon ko dilli acchhee tarah jaanati he
 He said that the AAP party's Delhi government has not been able to take forward even those tasks which were started by the Congress's Delhi government in the last 3 years
 aap sarkaar, congress sarkaar dwaara kiye gaye vikaas kaaryon kaa rakh rakhaav bhi nahin kar paa rahi he
 Arvinder Singh Loveline, citing Para b (1) (ii), b (1) (iv) (C) and 5 (a) of the minutes of the meeting of the Executive Finance Committee on 5 April 2018 said that on the detailed information of the project The work was to be done, the EFC was to be tested and its approval was to be taken from the cabinet with a detailed plan, but before all these processes PWD Minister Mr
 Satendra Jain approved the tender for the CCTV camera project And put that against GFR Rules and it is also against the rules to the tender for the project of this type
 dilli sarkaar main parliament secretary kii niyukti ke maamle ko lekar dilli sarkaar ke kuch emele ne dilli hycourt main yachika lagaai he
 The petition said that since the Delhi High Court had already pronounced its verdict in the matter in which the appointment of Parliament Secretary was declared invalid, there is no need for a hearing in the Election Commission
 lihaaja chunaav ayog kii yachika jab sunwaayee yogya hi nahin bachi he, jis vajah se ise khaarij kiya jaae
 Hearing the petition, the Delhi High Court has issued a notice to the Election Commission and asked what is the Election Commission's opinion about it? Answer this in the High Court
 21 november ko dilli hai court is maamle main phir sunwaayee karegaa
 The Delhi High Court has already pronounced its verdict last year in which the appointment of 21 Parliamentary Secretaries was declared invalid
 court ne kaha tha ki niyam ke mutabik dilli vidhansabha main 10 fisadi se zyada logon ko mantri kaa darja nahin diya ja saktaa or dilli vidhansabha main parliament secretary kii niyukti ke vakt is niyam kaa sidhe taur par ulanghan kiya gaya
 When the Kejriwal government appointed 21 Parliament Secretary, questions were also raised on these appointments
 dilli hoicortmen yachika bhi lagaai gai thi ki 21 parliament secretary kii ye niyukti asanvaidhanik he
 After a long hearing, the High Court, while giving its verdict on this petition, had made it clear that all these appointments are illegal

 An article by senior journalist Kalretta Gaul in the New York Times said that soon after the attack by US Navy distinguished soldiers at Laden's home, a Pakistani official told me that the US had direct evidence that ISI chief Ahmed Shuja Pasha Was aware of bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad

 The news of the NYT has been dismissed by Pakistani intelligence sources as baseless
 ek pakistani khufia sutara ne kaha ki enwiti kii khabar main koi sachai nahin he
 This is a completely baseless story
 pakistan main kisi ko bhi osama bin laden kii upasthiti kii jaankaree nahin thi
 The NYT reported that handwritten notes, letters, computer files collected from bin Laden's house and other information obtained during the raid reveal that there was regular correspondence between bin Laden and several terrorist leaders

 According to a report published in TOI, the figures recorded in the company's archives show that 12 in just 4 months at Vikhroli's factory
 83 lakh ballat box taiyaar kar liye gaye the
 On 15 December 1951, a newspaper named Bombay Chronicle had told that 15,000 boxes were being prepared in a day

 As soon as the Election Commission sent a recommendation to the President disqualifying 20 Aam Aadmi Party mlas, there has been a panic in the politics of Delhi
 agar raashtrapati ne sifarish manjuur kar lee to kejariwal sarkaar ke saamne badi musiibat khadi ho sakati he
 How can Kejriwal get caught in political trouble? In the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections, the Aam Aadmi Party won 67 of the 70 seats in the state
 iske baad rajouri garden seat se vidhayak rahe jaranel singh ne punjab se vidhansabha chunaav ladane ke liye istipha de diya tha
 Then in the by-elections this seat went to the bjp's account
 is tarah kejariwal kii party ke 66 vidhayak bache the
 Now the Election Commission has disqualified 20 mlas
 aise main unki sadsyta jane ke baad party ke paas vidhansabha main bahumat se sirf 8 zyada hi rah jaaenge
 Let me tell you that in 2015 the party came to power with a strong majority
 kam hote ja rahe hai aap ke vidhayakkageriwal ke saamne yahi dikkat nahin he, ve khud 4 mantri ko hataa chuke hai
 MLA from Matia Mahal
 aasim or kapil mishra, degree maamle main fanse jitendra singh tomars or sex sidi aane ke baad sandip kumaar shaamil bhi shaamil hai
 If 20 more are removed, the number will decrease further
 chunaav ayog dwaara jin 20 vidhayakon ko ayogy tehraaya gaya he, unhen or party se baagi bane vidhayakon hataa dete hai to kejariwal ke paas mahaj 44 vidhayak bachate hai
 a majority of 36 mlas are needed, of which Kejriwal has
 lekin bahumat se mahaj 8 vidhayak hi zyada bachenge
 Kejriwal is also surrounded by rebels
 There are some leaders in you who are constantly rebel
 haal hi party ke sansthaapak sadsy or varisht netaa kumaar vishwaas bhi rajyasabha main party dwaara na bheje jane ke chalate naaraaz hai
 In this way, Kejriwal will be crooked to preserve his government and hold on to the mlas
 bataa den ki party main kai vidhayak kumaar vishwaas ke kareebi hai
 In such a situation, it will not be easy to run power in the way Kejriwal was running the Delhi government till now
 itnaa hi nahin unke saamne majboot faisla lene or vidhayakon ko nazarandaaj karnaa bhi aasaan nahin hoga
 What will happen if the 20 AAP mlas were removed? Bye-elections will be held after the aap's 20 mlas are removed
 kejariwal or unki party ko dobaaraa in siton par jeet mili ye kahana mushkil he
 Let me tell you that the graph of the kind of wave that Kejriwal had during the 2015 election has dropped
 pichhali baar do siton par hue upachunaav main ek seat jahaan bijepi ke khate main gai he, to ek seat aap ne jiti thi
 In this way, it is not easy to win the victory of these 20 seats again
 aam aadmi party kii netaa anjali damania ne party se istipha de diya he
 It is being told that Anjali was not happy with the way the party functioned
 unhone likhaa he ki arvind kejariwal unke bade bhai jaise hai or vah arvind kaa sammaan karti hai
 Anjali Damania contested against Nitin Gadkari from Nagpur
 gadakari ne unhen kareeb teen lakh voton se haraaya tha
 Anjali Damania has written to AAP party colleagues in her resignation that no one is responsible for my sudden decision
 pyaare saathiyon, main bhare dil se 'aap' ke saath naata tod rahi hum
 i respect Arvind Kejriwal very much
 vah mere bade bhai jaise hai
 And my request is not to make any kind of politics conspiracy assumptions about my resignation
 maine apane mulyon ko lekar kabhi samjhauta nahin kiya or na hi kabhi karuungi
 i also pray to the media to take care of my privacy
 iske saath hi unhone party ko shubhakamanaayen deen
 It is noteworthy that Anjali Damania came into the limelight when she accused then BJP president Nitin Gadkari of suppressing the irrigation scam
 unka kahana tha ki sharad pavaar se nazdikiyon ke chalate unhone aisa kiya
 Significantly, in the 2014 elections, the Aam Aadmi Party fielded candidates for 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra, but the party could not win a single seat
 anjali, mayank, medha patkar tathaa vijay pandhaare sahit party ke kai senior netaa chunaav haar gaye
 There was a protest from Bengaluru to Delhi after his assassination and the state government formed an SIT to investigate the matter
 haalanki jaanch main shaamil adhikariyon ne grahamantri ke daawey par kuch bhi bolne se inkaar kar diya he
 Let us tell you that the Congress is in power in Karnataka at this time and the family of Gauri Lankesh also criticized the government due to no speed in investigation in this matter
 vahiin ek adhikari kaa yah bhi kahana he ki gauri lankesh kii hatya ke taar tarkshastri mem kulbergi hatyakand se bhi jude ho sakate hai
 The accused in this 2015 murder case are yet to be caught
 vahiin ek adhikari kaa yah bhi kahana he ki gauri lankesh kii hatya ke taar tarkshastri mem kulbergi hatyakand se bhi jude ho sakate hai

 'meri mahabuuba to aazaadee he', ladakpan kii umr main yah kehane kaa saahas or samvedansheeltaa rakhte the shahid bhagat singh
 Today is his birthday
 unhen salaam karte hue ham sampradayikta kii samasya par unke vichaar pesh kar rahe hai
 This article, published in the 'kirati' of June 1928, is a summary of the views of Bhagat Singh and his comrades on communalism
 mujffarnagar ke taaja jakhmon ke bich ye vichaar or bhi praasangik ho gaye hai
 You also read and think whether there can be a more logical and stronger answer to communalism? ”the condition of the Indian year is very pathetic at this time
 ek dharm ke anuyaayi duusare dharm ke anuyaayiyon ke jaani dushman hai
 Now, one religion has to be a staunch enemy of another religion
 yadi is baat kaa abhi yakeen na ho to lahore ke taaja dange hi dekh len
 How Muslims have killed innocent Sikhs, Hindus and how Sikhs have left no stone unturned
 yah maar-kaat isliye nahin kii gayi ki falaan aadmi doshi he, varan isliye ki falaan aadmi hindu he yaa sikh he yaa musalmaan he
 Just being a Sikh or a Hindu was enough for a person to be killed by Muslims, and similarly a person being a Muslim was a sufficient argument to kill him
 jab sthiti aisi ho to hindustan kaa ishwar hi maalik he
 Religions have turned the nation's fleet in such a situation, the future of India looks very dark
 in ‘dharmon’ ne hindustan kaa bedaa gark kar diya he
 And do not know yet when these religious riots will leave the pursuit of India
 in dangon ne sansar kii najaron main bharat ko badnaam kar diya he
 And we have seen that everyone gets carried away in the flow of this superstition
 koi birla hi hindu, musalmaan yaa sikh hota he, jo apana dimag thanda rakhata he, baaki sab ke sab dharm ke yah namelewa apane namelewa dharm ke rob ko kaayam rakhane ke liye dande laathiyaan, talavaarein-chhuren haath main pakad lete hai or aapas main sar-phod-phodkar mar jate hai
 Others get hanged and some are thrown in jails
 itnaa raktapaat hone par in ‘dharmajanon’ par angreji sarkaar kaa danda barasata he or phir inke dimag kaa keedaa thikaane aa jaataa he
 The leaders who wish everyone well have been seen, communal leaders and newspapers are behind these riots
 is samay hindustan ke netaaon ne aisi lid kii he ki chup hi bhalee
 The same leader who had taken the lead to make India independent and who did not get tired of the 'nationalism' and 'swarajya-swarajya', is either sitting quietly hiding his head or flowing in the flow of this bigotry
 Have gone sir chhipaakar baithne waalon kii sankhya bhi kya kam he? lekin aise netaa jo sampradayik aandolan main ja mili hai, jameen khodne se saikadon nikal aate hai
 The leaders who want the best of all from the heart are very few
 or sampradayikta kii aisi prabal baadh aayi hui he ki ve bhi ise roak nahin paa rahe
 There seems to be a bankruptcy of leadership in India
 sthaneey akhabaaron kii bhoomika par bhi sawaldusre sajjan jo sampradayik dangon ko bhadakaane main vishesh hissaa lete rahe hai, akhbaar vaale hai
 The business of journalism was once considered very high
 aaj bahut hi ganda ho gaya he
 These people provoke people's feelings by giving them big headlines against each other and make their heads go off
 ek-do jagah hi nahin, kitni hi jagahon par isliye dange hue hai ki sthaneey akhabaaron ne bade uttejnapurna lekh likhe hai
 There are very few writers whose hearts and minds have remained silent even in such days
 akhabaaron kaa asli karttavya shiksha dena, logon se sankeernata nikaalnaa, sampradayik bhavanaaen hataanaa, paraspar mail-milaap badhanaa or bharat kii sajhi rashtriyata bananaa tha lekin inhone apana mukhya karttavya agyaan failaana, sankeernata kaa prachaar karnaa, sampradayik bananaa, ladaai-jhagade karwaanaa or bharat kii sajhi rashtriyata ko nasht karnaa bana liya he
 This is the reason that considering the present state of India, tears of blood start flowing from the eyes and the question arises in the heart that 'bharat ka banega kya?' Swarajya has become a dream only people who know the passion and rise of the days of non-cooperation
 Seeing this situation, they cry
 kahan the ve din ki swatantrata kii jhalak saamne dikhaai detii thi or kahan aaj yah din ki swarajya ek sapana maatr ban gaya he
 This is the third benefit that the riots have got from these riots
 jiske astitv ko khatra paidaa ho gaya tha, ki aaj gayi, kal gayi vahi naukarshahi aaj apni jaden itani majboot kar chuki hai ki use hilaanaa koi maamuli kaam nahin he
 The roots of riots are in economics, if we find the root of these communal riots, then we know the reason for this is economic
 asahyog ke dinon main netaaon va patrakaaron ne dheron qurbaaniyaan deen
 His financial condition had deteriorated
 asahyog aandolan ke dhimaa padane par netaaon par avishvaas-sa ho gaya jisase aajkal ke bahut se sampradayik netaaon ke dhandhe chaupat ho gayi
 Whatever work happens in the world, there is definitely a question of stomach in its fold
 karl marks ke teen bade siddhanton main se yah ek mukhya siddhanth he
 It is due to this principle that the organization of tablig, tankeem, purification etc
 started, and for this reason today we have such a plight which is indescribable
 chavanni dekar koi kisi ko karvaa saktaa he apamaanitbus, sabhi dangon kaa ilaaj yadi koi ho saktaa he to vah bharat kii aarthik dasha main sudhaar se hi ho saktaa he
 In fact, the economic condition of the common people of India is so bad that one person can humiliate someone else by giving them a gargantuan
 bhukh or dukh se aatur hokar manushya sabhi siddhanth taak par rakh detaa he
 True, what would he not have done to die
 lekin vartmaan sthiti main aarthik sudhaar hona atyant kathin he kyonki sarkaar videshi he or logon kii sthiti ko sudharne nahin detii
 That is why people should wash their hands and follow it and should not breathe peacefully until the government changes
 garib, mehanatakashon or kisaanon ke ek hone kii jaruratlogon ko paraspar ladane se rokane ke liye varg-chetana kii jarurat he
 The poor, toiling people and peasants should clearly explain that your real enemies are the capitalists
 isliye tumhen inke hatkandon se bachakar rahanaa chahie or inke hathe chadh kuch na karnaa chahie
 The rights of all the poor of the world, irrespective of their caste, color, religion or nation, are the same
 tumhaari bhalaai isi main he ki tum dharm, rang, nasl or rashtriyata va desh ke bhedbhaav mitaakar ekajute ho jaao or sarkaar kii takat apane haathon main lene kaa praytn karo
 Nothing will harm you with these efforts, it will cut your chains someday and you will get financial freedom
 rus main aa gai he varg chetnaajo log rus kaa itihaas jaanate hai, unhen maaloom he ki jaar ke samay vahaan bhi aisi hi sthitiyaan thim vahaan bhi kitne hi samudaay the jo paraspar jut-patang karte rahete the
 But from the day there has been labor-rule there, the map has changed
 ab vahaan kabhi dange nahin hue
 Now everyone is considered 'human', not 'dharmajan'
 jaar ke samay logon kii aarthik dasha bahut hi kharaab thi
 That's why all the riots took place
 lekin ab roosiyon kii aarthik dasha sudhar gayi he or unamem varg-chetana aa gayi he isliye ab vahaan se kabhi kisi dange kii khabar nahin aayi
 In these riots, although we hear very disappointing news, one thing was very happy to hear in the Calcutta Riots
 vah yah ki vahaan dangon main trade union ke mazdooron ne hissaa nahin liya or na hi ve paraspar gutthamguttha hi hue, varan sabhi hindu-musalmaan bade prem se kaarkaanon aadi main uthte-baithte or dange rokane ke bhi ytn karte rahe
 This is because they had class consciousness and knew their class interest very well
 vargachetana kaa yahi sundar rasta he, jo sampradayik dange roak saktaa he
 There is an openness in the thoughts of the youth
 It has come to our ears that the young men of India are now getting fed up with the religions which teach them to fight and hate each other
 unamem itnaa khulaapan aa gaya he ki ve bharat ke logon ko dharm kii najar se-hindu, musalmaan yaa sikh rup main nahin, varan sabhi ko pehle insaan samajhate hai, phir bharatvasi
 The birth of these ideas in the youth of India shows that the future of India is bright
 bharatvasiyon ko in dangon aadi ko dekhakar ghabraana nahin chahie
 They should try hard not to create such an environment, and there should be no riots
 dharm or raajnneeti kaa ghalmail na ho1914-15 ke shaheedon ne dharm ko raajnneeti se alag kar diya tha
 They believed that religion is a personal matter of the individual, there is no interference from the other
 na hi ise raajnneeti main ghusaanaa chahie kyonki yah sarbat ko milakar ek jagah kaam nahin karne detaa
 Therefore, movements like Ghadar Party should remain united and united, in which Sikhs climbed up on the gallows and Hindu Muslims also did not lag behind
 is samay kuch bhartiya netaa bhi maidan main utre hai jo dharm ko raajnneeti se alag karnaa chaahate hai
 This is also a beautiful treatment for quarrel and we support it
 yadi dharm ko alag kar diya jaye to raajnneeti par ham sabhi ikatthe ho sakate he
 Regardless of religions, we may live separately
 hamaara khyaal he ki bharat ke sachche hamdard hamaare bataaye ilaaj par jarur vichaar karenge or bharat kaa is samay jo aatmghaat ho rahaa he, usase hame bachaa lenge

 lekin khud unki party main ajit pavaar sahit ek bada dhada shivesna ke saath jane ke paksh main nahi tha
 He wanted to share power with both BJP at the Center and the state
 jabaki duusare dhade kaa kahana tha ki idi kii notice kaa jis tarah saamana kar sharad pavaar ne apana kad badhaayaa tha or jis tarah se rajya main bijepi ke khilaaf unhen jansamarthan mila tha use dekhte hue bijepi ke saath jane se sharad pavaar kii chhavi kharaab hogi or galat sandesh jayega jabaki shivasena or congress ke saath milakar sarkaar banane se party or sharad pavaar kaa kad bhi badhegaa or rajya sarkaar par niyantran bhi rahegaa
 But most of the mlas and leaders of the party along with Ajit Pawar were in favor of going with the BJP
 ensipi ke ek netaa ke mutabik iske liye 20 ke kareeb chuninda netaaon kii ek meeting bulaai gai or chunki sharad pavaar khud bhi shivasena or congress ke saath milakar aghadi banane ke paksh main the isliye zyaadaatar ko unki ichha bataa di gai thi
 After all, that is what Sharad Pawar wanted
 zyaadaatar ne shivasena ke paksh main apni raay rakhi
 Sharad Pawar succeeded in making up his party's mind, but the Congress was yet to be persuaded
 pradesh congress ke netaa to lagbhag taiyaar ho chuke the
 Shiv Sena party chief Uddhav Thackeray had also met with Ahmed Patel, KC Venugopal and Mallikarjun Kharge, especially from Mumbai
 lekin congress kii taraf se hari jhandi nahin mil pai thi
 It was important that the Congress came inside the government, but talk was not being made
 dilli main sharad pavaar or sonia gandhi kii mulaakaat bhi safal nahin rahi thi
 But the pressure of Congress mlas was increasing on his own party
 sharad pavaar ne dilli jaakar ek baar phir se sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kii
 NCP and Congress leaders met in Delhi itself
 vahiin se kaaman minimum program main secular shabd ko shaamil karne ko lekar mumbai main baithe uddhav thakare se baatcheet bhi hui
 At the same meeting, the Congress also wanted to talk about the Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister and Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, but Sharad Pawar refused to take a decision on it saying that it would be appropriate to discuss it in front of Shiv Sena
 duusare din 22 november kii shaam varli ke nehru centre main teenon party ke netaaon kii baithak hui
 But the talk about the Speaker of the Assembly got worse
 sutron ke mutabik hua ye ki ahamed patel ne sharad pavaar se kaha ki aapane vidhansabha adhyaksh pad dene par hami bhari thi
 Pawar felt that he was being false, so he left the meeting midway
 baahar nikal kar unhone uddhav thakare ke netritv main sarkaar banane par aam sahmati kii baat kah kar ummid ko banaaye rakhaa
 But Ajit Pawar, who was angry with Sharad Pawar after getting up in the middle of this meeting again and again, felt that now he will convince his uncle to go with BJP
 unhone party offis se 54 vidhayakon ke hastakshar vaale patr kii do copy mangvayi or pahunch gayi devendra fadanvis ke paas auki shart rakhi ki subah hi agar shapath vidhi hoti he to wo bijepi ke saath sarkaar banane ko taiyaar hai
 He had papers with the signatures of 54 mlas, he himself was an NCP Legislature Party leader, so the BJP came to his notice
 sutara bataate hai ki ajit pavaar ne kul 54 nahin to 22 se 25 vidhayakon ke saath main aane kaa daawa kiya or ye bhi vaada kiya ki wo apane chachaa yani ki sharad pavaar ko manaa lenge
 But the opposite happened on the second day
 23 november kii subah ajit pavaar ko devendra fadanvis ke saath upmukhyamantri kii shapath lete dekh pavaar hairaan to hue lekin idi kii notice kii tarah apane khilaaf gai paristhiti ko unhone phir se apane paksh main kar liya
 In the morning, the first call was made to Shiv Sena party chief Uddhav Thackeray and assured him to correct everything and persuaded Congress to join the government by bringing back most of the mlas who went with Ajit Pawar
 rahi sahi kasar 25 november ko sarvocch nyaayalay ke faisle ne puri kar di jisamen bahumat ke liye khulaa matdaan or uski video recording karwaane kii baat kahi gai thi
 Ajit Pawar went back to his home and is also a contender for the Deputy Chief Minister in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government but after 5 years successfully being the Chief Minister, he was able to become the leader of the state BJP, Devendra Fadnavis

 Rampuria village, situated on the agra-mumbai National Highway, about 49 km from Indore, looks like any common village, but the people here took a decision five months ago that gave a unique identity to their village
 aktubar 2012 main gram panchayat ke chunaav main yahaan sarvasammati se shat-pratishat mahila gram panchayat kaa gathan hua he
 Positive results of handing over the reins of panchayat to women are also visible
 vigyaan snaatak sarpanch 32 varshiya mini bai ne 12veen tak shikshit apni saathi panch, 24 varshiya anjali patel ke saath milakar gaanv kii mahilaon ko sakshar banane kaa bidaa uthaaya he
 "we have decided to teach women two hours a day," says Mini
 sabase pehle nirakshar panch mahilaon ko sakshar banaaya jayega
 The path to create an all-female panchayat was not easy
 vaise to panchayat raaj act main 50 fisadi pad mahilaon ke liye arakshit rakhane kaa praavdhaan he lekin jab yahaan sarpanch sahit panchon ke sabhi pad mahilaon ko die jane kaa prastaav kiya gaya to khaasaa virodh hua kyonki sarpanch kaa pad mahila ke liye arakshit nahin tha
 Last year, when the elections to the Gram Panchayat, consisting of village Rampuria Khurd and Rampuria elders, were to be held, BJP District General Secretary Ashok Somani proposed former Sarpanch and District General Secretary of Congress Nandkishore Patel as Sarva Mahila Panchayat
 patel kehete hai, ‘‘chunaav ke dauraan hone vaali dushmani ko khatm karne ke lihaaj se yah prastaav thik laga
 "the initiative went ahead and all the male candidates with mutual consent decided to withdraw their leaflets and hand over the entire panchayat to the women
" somani kehete hai, ‘‘aarakshan ke jariye jo mahilaayein satta main bhagidaari karti hai, unamem adhikansh purush pradhan panchayat main niskriy hi rahati hai
 "but in the Sarva Mahila Panchayat there was absolutely no possibility of this happening
 rampuria panchayat ke liye liya gaya yah nirnay isliye mahatvapurn he kyonki yah adivasee bahul gaanv he
 Out of the total population of 1,210, 79% of the total population belongs to the Scheduled Tribes and six out of the 10 posts of the Panchas are reserved for this category
 do pad anusuchit jati ke liye, ek pad anya pichhadaa varg ke liye jabaki ek pad saamaanya varg ke liye he
 But by consensus, seven posts were given to women belonging to Scheduled Tribes
 anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit sarpanch pad kii jimmedaari mini ko dene kaa nirnay liya gaya
 The reason behind choosing Mini as sarpanch was to be educated
 sarpanch banate hi mini ne shiksha kii jyoti jagaane kaa faisla kiya
 Since the village's primary school has only one regular teacher and one guest teacher which is insufficient to handle five classrooms, Minnie herself started teaching the children in the school
 unka aglaa kadam tha nirakshar panch mahilaon ko sakshar bananaa
 In order to improve the lives of the women of the village, the Panchayat took another initiative, passed the prohibition of prohibition, and in the direction of environmental improvement, it also stopped the felling of trees
 haalanki gaanv kii is pahal se pradesh kaa prashasnic tabaka ab bhi anjaan he
 The panchayats elected unopposed are given incentives throughout the country including Madhya Pradesh
 lekin nirvirodh purna mahila panchayat ke liye alag se protsaahan raashi kii vyavastha nahin he
 State Social Justice, Panchayat and Rural Development Minister Gopal Bhargava says, "it is a good initiative to elect a full-fledged women panchayat
 iske liye protsaahan raashi par vichaar kiya jayega
 Officers have been instructed to create complete database
