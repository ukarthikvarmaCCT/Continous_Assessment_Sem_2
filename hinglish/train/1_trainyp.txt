 The Punjab school education board is constantly warming up to the changes made in the history book in the 12th syllabus
 guuruuvaar ko is mudde ko lekar sattashin congress or vipakshi akali dal khulkar aamane-saamne aa gaye
 The Akali Dal called a core committee meeting led by its chief Sukhbir Badal and announced that if the changes made in the syllabus would not be withdrawn and the chapters associated with Sikhism gurus would not be added back to the 12th history book
 In such a situation, on May 11, the Akali Dal will call a meeting of its district level officials from all over Punjab and decide the strategy ahead
 akali dal ke pradhan sukhbir badal ne punjab kii congress sarkaar par sikh dharm guruon ke itihaas ko puri tarah se khatm karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki shuukravaar ko akali dal kaa ek dailygation is mudde ko lekar punjab ke rajyapal se shikaayat bhi karegaa
 The Congress government of Punjab also fielded three of its ministers to answer the political attacks of the Akali Dal
 punjab sarkaar kii ore se vitt mantri manpreet badal, shiksha mantri opi soni or jail mantri sukhjinder randhaava ne press conference karke punjab skool shiksha board kii us team ko media se milwaaya jisane ye nai itihaas kii kitaab taiyaar kii he or akali dal par is maamle main dharm ke naam par logon kii bhavanaaen bhadakaane or aam janata ko bargalane kaa aarope lagaaya
 The ministers of the Punjab government said that the chapters associated with Sikhism gurus have not been removed from the history book of the 12th, but now these chapters have been included in the syllabus from the 11th itself, so that the children are not aware of the 11th Sikh religious leaders of Punjab
 Can study only from haalanki punjab sarkaar ke mantriyon ne media se mili jaankaree ke aadhaar par ye mana ki kitaab main punjabi main vyakaran kii kaaphi galtiyaan hai or in galatiyon ko jald hi sudhaar liya jayega
 If the merger of state-run banks is so revolutionary, then why is the market saying that it will be very heavy on banks for the next few years? If electric vehicles are needed so much, then why did the government feel that after the announcement of policy and concessions Haste is not right? These are both a hundred and ten point improvement on the principle, such as GST or Real Estate Regulator (RERA) etc

 At this time, cheap bank loans are needed to overcome the recession, but now banks are abandoning the loan disbursal and mixing the books and shivering with the fear of increasing losses
 nuksaan ghataane ke liye kaamkaaj main doharaav khatm hoga yani naukariyaan jaaengi
 Banks do not have the option to reduce the interest rate on deposits, deposits are falling, so how will they give loans on the basis of repo rate? This reform also got stuck in the circles of banks
 real estate regulatory bill (rera) ek bada sudhaar tha
 But it was revealed during the slowdown in housing construction

 But when the GST came into being, the demonetisation economy was drastically eroding, GST itself got submerged and businesses and budget were submerged

 The most interesting lesson of the reform's timeliness is recorded in the history of the devaluation of the rupee

 The second devaluation occurred in 1991, twice in 72 hours

 The timeliness of reforms comes from democracy

 The relationship between the two leaders has not been good since Narendra Modi came to the center

 Subsequently, Mamta did not participate in the NITI Aayog meeting in June

 tab mamata ne kaha tha ki vah unhen (narendra modi) ko desh kaa pradhanmantri nahin maanatin

 Actually, Chief Justice TS Thakur questioned PM Modi's speech from the ramparts of Red Fort
 'insaaf par piem modi ne kuch nahin bolaa'unhone kaha chimost popular piem kaa bhaashandedh ghanta suna
 He was expected to say something for justice too, but he did not say anything

 In the course of the conversation, he pointed at PM Modi and said that everyone knows who is doing what? The controversy over the appointment of judges has been hidden for some time between the Modi government and the judiciary over the appointment of judges

 " vahiin, aaropon par pratikriya dete hue kejariwal ne kaha, "kya unhone koi sakshya prastut kiya?" kejariwal ne esemes ke jariye apni yah pratikriya di
 It is noteworthy that the picture of Agnivesh, once a key member of Team Anna, still appears on the IAC website, he was dropped from Team Anna in August

 According to Agnivesh, Hazare held a core committee meeting in September in his village Ralegan Siddhi in Maharashtra where he said that donations received during the agitation should have been deposited in a proper account of the IAC

 The directive has been issued by the Election Commission based on a letter written by our political rival and BJP MLA Mr
 Vijender Gupta
 'AAP kaa ayog par aropadilip pandey ne likhaa, 'aam aadmi mohalla clinics kii avadharana healthcare ke kshetra main ek nai kranti kii tarah he or duniya bhar main is model kii saraahna kii ja rahi he
 It is known that anti-people forces like BJP have tried hard to stop such schemes and have upset the Delhi government
 is kaarykram ko patari se utaarne ke liye koi kasar nahin chodi he, lekin ham stabdh is baat se hai ki chunaav ayog ke rup main ek sanvaidhanik nikaay kuch raajnneetik takaton kii adhinsth sanstha ke rup main kaary kar rahaa he or unase aadesh le rahaa he
 The letter accuses the Election Commission of working for a particular party, saying that it is the constitutional duty of the Commission to ensure a common platform for all stakeholders and not to come under any political pressure
 anya dalon ke shabdon par sawaliaaf nepucha he kya iskaa matlab yah he ki ab ayog jahaan-jahaan 'bhartiya' or 'janata' shabd sarkari bhawanon, pratishthanon or billboard par dikhaai dete hai, unhen hataane or cover karne kaa aadesh denga kyonki ye donon shabd bhi ek raajnneetik dal ke naam main shaamil hai or us dal kaa naam he ‘bhartiya janata party’
 Similarly, will the Commission also order the removal of the words 'indian' and 'national' from all those Indian buildings, establishments and billboards as these words also indicate the name of a political party 'indian National Congress'? Appeal to know: AAP spokesperson has said in the letter that if the Commission feels the need to pass an order to remove the word 'aam Admi', then the state government will go before any such order
 Su and Aam Aadmi Party should be given the opportunity to present their case

 iske tahat vah ghar-ghar jaakar logon se loksabhaa chunaav main aam aadmi party ko vot or chanda dene kii apil karenge
 In this campaign, apart from Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, all ministers, all mps, Lok Sabha in-charge, all mlas, all councilors, party officials and workers will take to the streets
 ye sabhi ghar-ghar jaakar vot maangenge
 They will also appeal for donations

 Party workers will go door-to-door to tell that so far our government has spent about Rs 2 lakh crore in three and a half years
 agar duusari partiyon kii tarah aam aadmi party bhi sabhi thekedaaron ko kah detii ki 1 pratishat party fund main jamaa karana he to party ke paas 2,000 karod rupee ikattha ho jate
 But the Aam Aadmi Party did not do so

 Attacking Aam Aadmi Party and Arvind Kejriwal, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari said that AAP leaders should do mental checkup, their mood is not good
 unhone kaha ki aap netaa gambhir muddon par jokaron kii tarah bayaan dete hai
 On the question of AAP leader Ashutosh's Ajit Doval on Manoj Tiwari's counterattack by Kejriwal, Manoj Tiwari said that the friends of Kikjeriwal are doing stones in Kashmir

 How to get someone to be a gimmick? On the statement made by AAP leaders of BJP mps about AAP worker Soni's confession to meet the President, Manoj Tiwari said that if it is a gimmick to give justice to a dead daughter or sister, yes we did, someone If he exposes the misdeeds, he is a gimmick for them
 dilli ke log kejariwal se trastakejariwal ke modi ji marava denge vaale bayaan par bijepi saansad ne kaha ki kejariwal dilli main kitnon ko maar rahe hai,jal bordake gadde main baccha mar gaya lekin koi milane nahin gaya
 Due to these, some financial death is dying in Delhi, one is dying due to intoxication
 unhone kaha ki kejariwal maut baant rahe hai, jabaki narendra modi jivan dete hai or yahi unke pet kaa dard he
 Taking a dig at the statement that the BJP is conducting an auto strike, the BJP MP said that at the time of elections, the auto owners become their own

 According to the MP, it is the misfortune of Delhi that these people are ruling

 Venkaiah ji has said about the healthy debate
 dibet to is masale par samvidhan sabha ke samay se ho rahi he
 If you google yourself, you will find that do chaar supreme court ke faislon ke alaava kuch bhi nayaa nahin kaha ja rahaa he
 The old things are removed and the same is being said again
 sarkaar kis tarah kii samaan naagarik samhita chaahati he, uskaa draft kya he, aaj tak kisi ne samaane nahin rakhaa
 Then what will the healthy debate be about
 jaise pehla sawaal he ki kya aap jaanate hai ki bharat ke samvidhan ke anuchhed 44 main yah kaha gaya he ki rajya, bharat ke samast rajyashetra main nagarikon ke liye ek samaan civil praapt karaane kaa prayaas karegaa? iskaa haa yaa naa main jawaab dena he
 Such questions are asked in the survey
 16 main se 11 sawaal aise puche gaye hai jinka jawaab haa yaa naa main dena he
 The remaining five questions are asked in the style of yes or no, but they are given below so that you can present your side in detail
 haa yaa naa kii style main puche gaye ye sawaal kya sahi sawaal hai, paryaapt sawaal hai, kya in sawaalon se itane gambhir vishay ko gaharaai se samajhane kaa mauka miltaa he
 Some questions have been asked in this way
 
 
 - kya samaan civil samhita se logon ko phayda pahonchega? - Is there a need for a uniform civil code? - kya isse gender justise aayega? - Should it be optional? sawaal he ki kya logon ko phayda pahonchega, phir poochhate hai ki gender justise aayega, kya phayda or gender justise do alag alag chizein hai
 Now the question is coming in your mind that the questions asked by the Law Commission are only related to Muslim personal law
 ekaadh hi sawaal hai jo hindu or isai samudaay se sambandhit hai, baaki ke kuch sawaalon main dharm kaa zikr nahin he lekin unka sambandh muslim personal lau se lagata he
 Still, it should be talked about whether the Law Commission questions are so revolutionary that it seems that the Commission wants to end the practices of all religious and ethnic societies and bring everyone under the roof of a law

e
 child custody, maintenance, inheritance, inheritance
 ham jaanane kaa prayaas karenge ki child castady, uttaradhikaar ko lekar sabhi dharmon main ek kanoon nahin he, sabhi rajyon main ek kanoon nahin he, kya samaan civil samhita kaa yah bhi matlab hoga ki sabhi rajyon main ab ek hi kanoon lagu hoga, kya is vakt sabhi rajyon main ek hi kanoon lagu he
 Our aim is to understand the question properly and know the answer so that it can be healthy debated as stated by Venkaiah Ji

 Are there problems in other societies besides triple talaq? kya un par hindu code bill yaa sansad ke banaae nae kanoon lagu nahin hote hai

 unki marji ke bhi isamen vikalp diye gaye hai
 Why boycott then
 sawaal number 6 main bahuvivaah samaapt karne ke vikalp puche gaye hai
 It is clear from the triple talaq that Muslims are related to society, but there is no mention of any religion in the question of polygamy
 kya hindu code bill ke baad bhi ye kisi gair muslim samaaj main prachlit he
 The Supreme Court has already said that the ground reality is that even after being banned, it is still prevalent among Hindus
 sawaal number 6 main maitri qaraar yani friendship dead kii baat kii gai he wo kya he
 It belongs to which religion, community or region
 sawaal se saaf nahin hota he
 The comments sawaal 8 main poocha gaya he ki hindu stri sampatti ke adhikaar ko behatar tareeke se istamaal kar sake iske liye kya kadam uthaaye jane chahie, aksar putr ke naam hi vasiyat kar di jaati he

 There is talk of making similar laws or implementing them
 to yah bhi poocha janaa chahie tha ki samaan naagarik samhita kii maang karne vaale bhi pita kii sampatti main beti or bahanon ko hissaa kyon nahin dete hai
 There will be very few who contribute
 kya sarkaar yah vyavastha karne ja rahi he ki sabhi pariwaron ko sarkaar ke yahaan report karnaa hoga ki pita kii sampatti bantate vakt betiyon or bahanon ko kitna diya gaya
 Rather, the government can make it a part of Beti Bachao and Beti Padhao campaign
 samaaj main krantikari badlaav aayega
 Question number ten asks whether you agree that all personal laws and practices should have the same marriage age? hindu marriage act or special marriage act main ladakiyon ke liye shaadi kii umr 18 he or ladakon ke liye 21
 This law applies broadly, but it is also true that marriages are happening at an early age
 ham jaanane kaa prayaas karenge ki musalamaanon main shaadi kii umr kya he or uskaa paalan kis had tak hota he
 Is question number ten related to Muslim personal law or other communities as well

 'rejected goods' leaving the party The first attack was made by Mayawati on leaders like Swami Prasad Maurya and Brajesh Pathak who left the party and moved to BJP, Mayawati termed them as 'rejected goods'
 mayawati ne kaha bijepi kii haalat itani kharaab he ki BSP ke rejected maal ko bhi unke rashtriya adhyaksh gale main patta daal rahe hai
 i am grateful to those who left the party for personal and family interests
 ye gandagi khud nikal gai or sari gandagi bijepi main chali gai

 BSP is a political movement along with a political movement
 bispi chhodkar jane vaala akelaa hi jaataa he, unke folover nahin jate
 Mayawati announced that the BSP would never give tickets to the type of people left except BSP
 mayawati ne kaha ki party chhodkar gaye log tikat bechney kaa jhootha aarope lagaate hai or media main kuch log aise bhi hai, maahaul lambey samay tak banaae rakhte hai or bispi ke khilaaf sajeesh rachate hai

 Mayawati said that if there is a stampede in the BSP, the BSP is weak, then why would people give crores of rupees to buy tickets, all this is false propaganda

 Advising Mayawati to take a lesson on Dayashankar Singh's case, he may be attacked like Dayashankar
 unhone party ke logon ko satark rahane kii salaah dete hue kaha ki josh main hosh khone kii jarurat nahin he

 Roaring in Azamgarh, Mayawati said that it is not good for the officers and police officers who are giving shelter to this goon and mafiaraj

 The events of Mathura, Bulanshahar cannot be forgotten

 The Metro project was started by the BSP in 2008

 Congress also attacked in the rally, Congress is out of state as well as out of center
 congress kaa savarnon ko 10 fisadi cote kaa vaada chhalaava he
 The Congress put forward an elderly woman of the nebrahman community, but in Delhi they did nothing for the Dalits

 pm's dream of good days has turned into bad days
 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas' maatr hawaii naaraa ban gaya he
 He said that announcing the memorial of Ambedkar will not benefit the Dalits
 daliton ke ghar main khaanaa khaane se daliton kaa utthan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Dalits now want self-respect, not sympathy

 The special thing is that the family stays away from power, but power remains around it
 aaj kii taarikh main uddhav thakare shivasena ke mukhiya hai jo hindu rashtravaadi party he or is party kaa gathan june, 1966 main unke pita bala sahib thakare ne kiya tha
 As long as Balasaheb Thackeray remained active in politics, Uddhav stayed away from the political scene or was seen standing behind him
 haalanki uddhav party kii kaman sanbhaalane se pehle shivasena ke akhbaar saamana kaa kaam dekhte the or uske sampadak bhi rahe
 However, later, due to Bal Thackeray's growing age and ill health, he started looking after the party's functioning after 2000
 is dauraan vah party kii chunaav sambandhi gatividhiyon main shaamil hote the
 The victory extended to the 2002 victory in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections in 2002, to which Shiv Sena was a resounding success and was credited with making him the party's working president from January 2003
 haalanki yahaan tak kaa safar unke liye behad chunauteepurn rahaa kyonki unke chachere bhai raaj thakare party main bal thakare ke nirvivaad uttaradhikari maane ja rahe the, lekin bal thakare ke apane bete uddhav ko uttaradhikari chune se aahat raaj ne 2006 main party chhod di or nai party kaa gathan kiya
 However, he has been on the party since 2004 and since then he has been taking every major decision related to the party
 kam bolne vaale uddhav thakare ko jab bal thakare ne shivasena ke uttaradhikari ke rup main chunaa to kai logon ko aashcharya hua tha kyonki party ke baahar log unka naam tak nahin jaanate the or raaj thakare sambhavit uttaradhikari ke rup main jane jate the
 Born in Mumbai on July 27, 1960, Uddhav Thackeray is survived by his wife Rashmi Thackeray, besides two sons Aditya and Tejas
 unka bada betaa aditya dada or pita kii tarah raajnneeti main sakriy he or shivasena kii yuva sanghathan yuva sena kaa rashtriya adhyaksh he
 Aditya is also the president of the Mumbai District Football Association
 haalanki apane pita or bade bhai kii tulana main tejas jansampark se dur hi rahete hai
 Photography fondly, 59-year-old Uddhav enjoys wildlife photography beyond political life and organizes numerous exhibitions and environmental events
 photo par aadhaarit unki kai photo books hai jo ki rajya ke logon, janajivan or aitihaasik viraasat se judi baton kaa zikr karti he
 However, during the Bal Thackeray era, the party has always remained a strong party in Maharashtra and has an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party due to having a similar ideology
 2014 main narendra modi ke centre main aane se pehle shivasena is gathbandhan main bade bhai kii bhoomika main rahati thi, lekin iske baad bijepi vahaan bade bhai kii bhoomika main aa gai
 The Shiv Sena could not become its chief minister after the alliance won the assembly in 2014
 2014 ke baad lambey samay tak bijepi ke saath khatas bane rahane ke baad 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle uddhav thakare ne bijepi ke saath chunaav ko lekar seat kaa bantwaaraa kar liya
 BJP will contest from 25 seats and Shiv Sena from 23 seats
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki pichley 5 saal tak centre kii modi sarkaar par lagaataar sawaal khadey karne vaali shivasena ko uddhav thakare is baar kahaan tak le ja pate hai

 Half a dozen candidates have returned tickets, and after Arvind Kejriwal's government in Delhi, the workers associated with AAP have also disappeared
 elahabaad main namakan ke liye buudhvaar ko colectrate pahunche aam aadmi party ke pratyaashee adarsh shastri or shimla shri ke prastaavak gaayab ho gaye
 After waiting for half an hour for the proposers, both the candidates returned from the nomination site without filling the form

 Both candidates will file nominations on Thursday
 phulpur se 'aap' pratyaashee shimlashri or elahabaad se 'aap' ummidavaar adarsh shastri ko tay kaarykram ke mutabik dopaher 12 baje tak namakan karnaa tha
 But both did not reach the nomination site till two o'clock

 The nomination was to be done by three o'clock
 dopaher dhai baje donon pratyaashee colectrate get par aakar khadey hue gaye
 The officers stationed there for a long time did not understand what the two were waiting for
 kisi ne tokaa ki aadha ghanta bachaa he, parchaa nahin bharaa to khaali haath lautnaa padegaa
 On being interrupted, Shimlashree said that two of the ten proponents Gopesh Tripathi and Ashutosh have not arrived

 In Uttar Pradesh, former Union Minister Anupriya Patel's party Apna Dal (S) is facing difficulties, as BJP is not in the mood to give more importance to this important ally
 mantrimandal vistaar main najar andaaj karne ke baad bijepi pratapgarh kii sadar vidhansabha seat ko bhi apana dal (es) se chhinane kii kavayad main juty he
 While Apna Dal (S) is not ready to leave this seat under any circumstances
 bataa den ki uttar pradesh kii 13 vidhansabha siton par hone vaale upachunaav ke liye bijepi ne puri tarah se qamar kas liya he
 The BJP is in a mood to contest the assembly seat of Pratapgarh itself and local leaders are busy preparing for it
 jabaki 2017 main is seat par apana dal (es) ke sangam laal gupta ne jeet darj kii thi
 But in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he joined the BJP and won the Pratapgarh parliamentary seat and reached the Parliament, due to which the Sadar seat of Pratapgarh has become vacant
 apana dal (es) kii netaa anupriya patel ko is baar narendra modi ke kendriya cabinet main jagah nahin mil saki he
 After this, Ashish Patel, who is Anupriya Patel's husband and president of the party, was not given a place in the recent cabinet expansion of Uttar Pradesh
 jabaki unke mantri banane kii charchaa bahut joro par thi
 After giving one to two blows to the Apna Dal (S), the BJP is now engaged in giving a third blow
 bijepi pratapgarh kii sadar vidhansabha seat upachunaav main apana dal (es) se le sakati he
 In such a situation, if the BJP fields its candidate from Pratapgarh seat, it will be a very difficult period for Apna Dal (S), the biggest ally in Uttar Pradesh
 iske baad apana dal (es) par alag siyaasi rasta taiyaar karne kaa dabaav hoga
 The Apna Dal (S) feels that the BJP is suppressing them with its political power and this could have a negative impact within the party
 philhal donon partiyaan is mudde par chup hai, lekin donon ke bich shah-maat kaa khel jari he
 The increased uneasiness within Apna Dal (S) is clearly visible from this silence
 baharhaal apana dal (es) philhal wet and watch ke mood main he
 In such a situation, if BJP decides on the Sadar Assembly seat of Pratapgarh itself, then there is bound to be a rift in the alliance in the state, because Anupriya Patel does not want to leave this seat in any Surat
 haalanki bijepi ke saath-saath apana dal (es) bhi is seat par chunavi taiyaari main juty hui he
 Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, people are looking for a perfect shelter to hide their heads

 On the other hand, there are hundreds of needy families in the village, for whom the Prime Minister's residence is proving to be far-fetched
 baalod jile ke kalankapur gaanv main ek pakke ghar kii pehali manzil par ban rahe is ghar ko dekhakar log hairat main hai
 This house is being constructed under Prime Minister Housing Scheme

 After making the report in the government records, the officials gave permission to build the Prime Minister's residence on top of this pucca house

 In Gopalganj, two such elderly women have been honored by the district administration, who make a living by seeking help from the people, but by saving these money, they have set an example by constructing a toilet in the house under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
 in mahilaon ne yah sabit kar diya he ki desh yaa samaaj main kisi prakaar ke yogadan ke liye paise nahin, jazbe kii jarurat he
 District Collector of Gopalganj Animesh Parashar told IANS on Friday that the Konhwa gram panchayat of Gopalganj Sadar block has been declared open defecation free on Thursday
 is maukey par jila prashasan ne konhva panchayat kii 55 varshiya mehrun khatun or 60 varshiya jagaranee devi ko puraskrit kar sammanit kiya
 Actually, both women are living by seeking help or wages from people, but the work done by them is highly commendable
 mehrun khatun kahati hai, narendra modi jab se pradhanmantri bane hai, tab se desh ko svachh rakhane ke liye abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 In such a situation, people of this panchayat are also with us
 saaf-suthra rahane main kya harj he
 District Magistrate Parashar says that under the Central Government's Swachh Bharat Mission and the Lohia Sanitation Campaign of the Government of Bihar, the campaign of open defecation is being carried out in every village in the district
 in donon mahilaon ko jab is abhiyaan ke bare main pataa chalaa to ye isse bahut prabhavit huin
 The effect of this was that by saving the money collected by asking for help from the people, they got toilets built in their homes
 unhone kaha ki aaj ye donon mahilaayein samaaj main misaal ban chuki hai
 They say that these two women are old, but have given a new message to the society
 mehrun khatun kahati hai, bheekh mangakar parivaar chalaane ke kaaran hamen kabhi sammaan nahin mila, log nichi nigaah se dekha karte the, lekin svachh bharat abhiyaan ke liye is pahal ne hamaara darja badha diya he
 People are now watching with respect
 ek adhikari kehete hai ki kam padhi-likhi or vruddh hone ke kaaran jagaranee devi na thik se hindi bol paati hai or naa hi bhojpuri bol paati hai, lekin unke kiye gaye kaaryo ne unke sandesh ko bahut dur tak samaaj main pahunchaa diya he
 She said that these two women have become an example in society today
 ullekhneey he ki konhva panchayat main kul 1519 ghar hai, jisamen se kareeb 600 ghar kuch maheene purv tak shauchalay viheen the
 The head of the village panchayat, Manoj Kumar, also expresses happiness over open defecation, saying that today the women of the panchayat participated extensively in this task, Mehroon and Jagrani have given a message to the country, not only the entire state
 If there is passion, no work is difficult

 And with the same quarrel, Feroze hatched a conspiracy to kill the teenager

 isi vajah se kishor ki hatya ke baad parivaaravaalon ko mantri or uske bete par shaq tha

 He said that no power in the world can build a mosque in Ayodhya
 masjid hindustan main bahut sari hai, kahin bhi namaaj pard lenge
 There is a temple in Ayodhya, Namaz cannot be read there

 Sakshi Maharaj says that it is the opinion of a large Hindu of the country that there should be a grand Ram temple built there and no one can stop it
 1994 main supreme court kii paanch jajon kii bench ne ismail faruki cese main ram janmabhumi maamle main yathasthiti barkaraar rakhane kaa nirdesh diya tha taaki hindu puja kar saken
 The bench had also said that offering prayers in the mosque is not an essential part of Islam

 The Patel community says that till now the money they have invested in banks has contributed a lot to the development of Gujarat, but now when they have raised their voice for reservation, they are not being listened to

 The comments philhal to ye kaarykram sirf sabarkantha zile main hi ho rahaa he, lekin patel andolan ke ubhar rahe netaa hardik patel ne ab gujarat ke sabhi patelon ko is kaarykram main judakar rajya sarkaar se aarthik asahakaar kii apil kii he
 In such a situation, the government is also worried that if all such programs are done by all the Patel community of the state, then new trouble may arise

 Patel, who owned 14 per cent of Gujarat's population of around six crore, was once a farmer owning agricultural land, who later joined businesses such as diamond polishing
 lekin ab unka kahana he ki unke yuvaaon ko uniwarsity str kii padhai or sarkari naukariyon se dur rakhaa ja rahaa he, or aisi jatiyon ke logon ke liye arakshit kar diya gaya he, jinhen zyaada pichhadaa samajha jaataa he, or jinhen mukhyadhara main laane kii zarurat samajhi jaati he
 Hardik Patel says that Narendra Modi, who has now become the Prime Minister of the country, failed to create such a model of development in Gujarat during his 13 years of chief ministership, which benefits all castes and classes
 iske bajaae vah aisi nitiyaan banaate rahe, jinase bade vyapaaron or vyapaariyon ko phayda pahunche
 Significantly, the Congress and other opposition parties have also blamed the ruling BJP
 patel samudaay kaa kahana he ki ab tak gujarat ke vikaas main unke dwaara bainkon main lagaaye gayi paise kaa bahut bada yogadan he lekin ab jab unhone aarakshan ko lekar awaz uthaai he to unki baat nahin suni ja rahi
 If they withdraw money from the banks, the government's pace of development will decrease, then the government may have to listen to their voice
 tippaniyan At present, this program is happening only in the Sabarkantha district, but Hardik Patel, the emerging leader of the Patel movement, has now appealed to the state government for economic co-operation by joining all the Patels of Gujarat in this program
 aise main sarkaar bhi chintaa main he ki agar rajya ke sabhi patel samudaay dwaara is tarah ke kaarykram kiye jaayenge to nai musiibat khadi ho sakati he
 It is important that the state Chief Minister Anandiben Patel had a discussion with Hardik Patel, Lalji Patel and other agitating leaders on Monday, but such an agitation is intensifying due to no result in it, which is a matter of concern for the government is

 You must have heard many times that the police uniform was taken off, the uniform was taken off, the uniform was taken away
 par kya kabhi aapane kisi police vaale ko khud se apni vardi utaarne ke baad saanwariyaa style main sirf towel main dekha he? yakeen maniye, jisane bhi yah najaara dekha, vahi shame se dang rah gaya
 What should the picture be like 
 
 dilli police kaa ek jawan duty par nikalne se pehle har rose subah apane ghar ke baahar aata he, sirf towel main
 Then his towel opens and closes with each passing person
 saanwariyaa ke dance main tauliya utaarte vakt hero camere kii taraf peeth kiye hota he, jabaki ye jawan rose camere ke saamne nanga hota he or wo bhi bich sadak par
 Jaydev Singh Malik, a Delhi Police constable, is posted at Dariyaganj police station in central Delhi
 ab dilli main garmi itani he ki ye tauliye main bhi atapate nahin lag rahe
 But even this is fine, but what next? Sanwaria of Delhi Police, towel-tanned Sanwaria remove their clothes so that there is nothing left on their body? If they have to be removed, then take them inside your house, no one will say anything
 lekin aam sadak, aam raste or khud aam logon kii suraksha kii hifaazat karne vaala khud aisi harakatein karata he ki shame bhi sharmaa jaae
 Responsibility for police uniform on body, gun in hand and law and order on shoulder
 
 
 to ye hai dilli ke bheed bhare ilaake dariyaganj main duty par tainaat dilli police ke consteble janaab jayadev singh malik
 Constable Malik is often seen doing his duty in his area
 lekin sawaal yah he ki jab janaab malik duty par nahin hote hai, to akhir wo kya karte hai?dariyaganj se takreeban 15 kilometre dur maansarovar park ilaake main malik ek bilkul hi alag andaaz main nazar aate hai
 The picture of Police Constable Jaidev Singh Malik is not taken with an open camera, but from a CCTV camera, as Malik cannot certainly allow himself to be imprisoned in an open camera
 janaab jayadev singh malik kii in tasveeron ko dekh kar pehali baar to koi bhi buree tarah chaunk jaae, lekin kehete hai naa ki tasviren jhooth nahin boltin
 So, CCTV cameras cleared everything that Malik did
 taarikh: 03 may, 2013vaqt: subah ke 06 bajkar 17 minutejagah: maansarovar park, dillipane ghar ke baahar subah-subah malik kii harakatein uske daily routine kaa hissaa he
 Malik walks out of his house with only a towel wrapped on the body and after getting out, he urinates in front of his neighbor's house
 iske baad saafe-safaai ke bahaane ghanton ghar ke baahar yun hi naa sirf tauliya lapete khadaa rahata he, balki vaqt-bevakt pados main rahanevaali auraton or tamaam logon ko tauliya kholkar apana nanga jism dikhaane se bhi baaj nahin aata
 The question is, what kind of ghost of nakedness is on Malik's head? After all, why does he stand naked naked every morning outside his house like this? After all, why does he shamelessly urinate outside his neighbor's house every day? After all, why are not his neighbors and other people of the locality dare to stop Malik? So sir, when you know the full story of Constable Jaidev Singh Malik's nakedness, believe me, you will be shocked
 is consteble kii karatuut se sirf uske padosi hi nahin, balki puure ilaake ke log pareshaan hai
 He walks out of the house everyday and gets naked seeing his neighbors
 ab ye kisi sanak he? ye kaisaa paagalpan he? koi samaj hi nahin paaya
 Neighbors made all efforts to improve this Sanwariya of Delhi Police, but it did not desist from its antics
 akhirkaar majabuuran is pulisavaale ko benaqaab karne ke liye camere kii madad leni padi
 Date: May 03, 2013 Time: 06:17 am in the morning
 Jaidev Singh Malik, constable of Delhi Police, walks out of his house early in the morning
 us vaqt uske jism par sirf ek tauliye ke or kuch bhi nahin
 Incidentally, an elderly man living in the neighborhood also comes out of his house and Malik opens his towel and shamelessly stands in front of the elderly
 lekin kehete hai naa jab samnevaala insaan nangepan par utar aae, to shame khud ko kerani padati he
 So, the elderly person thinks it is right to move in front of Malik
 lekin ye koi ek din baat nahin he, balki pichley takreeban do maheenon se malik bina naga rose apane ghar ke baahar laaj-sharam chhodkar aisi harakatein karata aa rahaa he
 Let us now look at some of Malik's other misdeeds
 
 
 taarikh: 15 may, 2013samay: subah 03 bajkar 52 mintelik ke pados main rahanevaale bujurg satpal rose subah apane ghar se tahalne ke liye nikalate hai or is rose malik unke ghar se baahar nikalne se pehle thik unke ghar ke baahar hi peshaab kar rahaa he
 Two days later, Malik's attitude remains the same
 pehle wo apane padosi ke ghar ke darvaaze par peshaab karata he or phir ashleel harakat
 
 
 Date: May 22, 2013 Time: 06 o'clock in the morning Malik opens his towel as soon as he gets out of the house in the morning and then his vulgar acts begin
 hameshaa kii tarah malik is din bhi mahaz ek tauliye main ghar ke baahar maujuud he
 Then a boy comes to the neighboring house and seeing him coming, Malik once again does the same thing and means opening the towel and standing in front of him
 taarikh: 28 may 2013vaqt: subah ke 6 bajelekin is rose to jaise sari hadein khatm ho jaati he
 First, wearing a towel on the bike's cleanliness, Malik opens his towel and starts obscene acts in front of the neighbors
 dhire-dhire vakt guzarataa he or sadak par logon kii awajahi shuru ho jaati he
 But the movements of this Delhi Police constable continue
 or malik tab jaise apni sari hadein laangh jaataa he, jab chajje par ai padosi kii ko dekhakar wo ek baar phir apana tauliya utarkar isharebaazi shuru kar detaa he
 But now, having come free from Malik's antics, his neighbors have written reports against him, women have also started opening their mouths
 vaise aap shaayad soch rahe hon ki aasapaas ke log shaayad malik ke police main hone kii vajah se khoff khaakar hi chup rahete honge, lekin ek hairaani kii baat ye bhi he malik jis padosi se apni khundak nikaalane ke liye aisi harakatein kar rahaa he, wo khud bhi kabhi dilli police main rahe hai or unka betaa ab bhi sab inspector kii naukari kar rahaa he
 But the cry here is that the police are not even listening to the complaints of the people of the department against their own dignitaries
 jaahir he ab aap soch rahe honge ki akhir malik aisa karata kyon he? to iskaa jawaab bhi dilli police ke hi ritred sab inspector ke paas maujuud he
 If they believe, they have been having an old dispute with Malik about the property, but now Malik has come down on such fallen antics
 lekin dekhie apni ochhi harkaton ke saath sisitivi camere main kaid hone ke baad jayadev malik bechaargi bhari surat banaakar ise apane khilaaf ek saazish qaraar de rahaa he
 On the contrary, landed on hooliganism and nakedness near his house, Jayadev Malik describes himself as a victim of his own neighbor's oppression
 baharhaal, sisitivi tasveeron main malik kii harkaton ko dekhne ke baad ab kisi ke liye bhi ye samajhnaa mushkil nahin he ki sach koun bol rahaa he or jhooth koun? pehle police ne ye sabakuch dekhne ke baavjood malik ke khilaaf halki or jamaanti dhaaraon ke tahat maamla darj kiya tha, lekin ajtak kii koshish ke baad shanivaar ko police ne malik ke khilaaf gaiyr jamaanti dhaaraon ke saath-saath privansion of child from sexual offenses yani posco ke tahat bhi maamla darjkar use giraftaar kar liya he
 However, seeing the antics of Delhi Police Constable Jaidev Singh Malik, one can also remember the title track of Ranbir Kapoor's film Saawariya
 haalanki apana sipaahi naa to ranbir kapur he or naa yahaan saanwaribia koi gaanaa filmaaya ja rahaa he
 But the brothers are saying that they are not taking the name of the hawk with style

 kitaab kaa naam:nirvasanalekhak:tasalima nasrinprakaashak:vaani prakashankimat:hard bound adishan 395 rupeek aurat, jo us duniya ko naamanzoor kar detii he, jisko chhodane yaa jisase peeche hatane se, usko jillat or dhokhaa mila
 a woman who refuses to obey society's orders, her customs and traditions
 ek aurat jiskaa baar-baar ladkhadana, girnaa, phenkaa janaa sikhaata he use, sidhe khadey hona, jiske ladkadhaate kadam sikhaate hai use chalanaa, jisaki bhatakan dikhaati he use rasta
 Slowly she feels the development of a new consciousness inside her, a simple thought binds her - 'this life is her own, not that of anyone else'
 vah sirf khud hi us par raaj kar sakati he, koi doosraa nahin'
 This is the story of a girl who has come out of the furnace of patriarchy, like a glowing steel
 yah kahani he tasalima nasrin kii
 Taslima Nasreen came into the limelight due to her novel 'lajja' in India
 is upanyaas ke chhapane ke baad taslima ko kai tarah kii bandisho se do-chaar hona padaa
 She will hardly forget her pain
 iske vishay main vah apni aatmakatha 'nirvaasan' main kuch is tarah bayaan karti hai, '
 
 
 In the real world it is forbidden for a flesh-and-flesh woman to claim and declare boldly - i am the girl who, after those traumatic, turbulent years, has risen again today

 'nirvaasan' main tasalima ne apane anubhav, dard, apane jaanane waalon se mila dhokhaa, aarope or raajnneeti kii tamaam baaten kishton main rakhane kii koshish kii he
 In this part of the autobiography, Taslima gives a statement on her presence in the Bengali literary world and her impeccable relationship with many literatures and her exile
 yah kitabon ke nahin, tasalima ke jindagi ke prishth he
 Only those people who have written on these can understand the whirlwind of life on their bodies
 kisi vyakti yaa samaaj kaa itihaas pannon par darj hone se pehle kin-kin raaston se gujarata he, agar jaananaa samajhnaa ho to is pustak ko jarur padhein

 Very good translation

 You can classify it as a great translation
 pustak na padhane ke kai kaaran ho sakate hai
 If you are not interested in someone's private life, even if it is not Taslima Nasreen, you are not interested in their dispute and what was their mental state at that time, what opinion do the intellectuals of the society have on such issues , Do not read this book if you are not interested in knowing it

 There is a wedding in Indore on 22 February
 ye shaadi kai myanon main baaki shaadiyon se alag he
 You must have attended a lot of weddings and you would have seen the groom coming in a car on a mare
 baraat kaa kai baar aapane aise hi swaagat kiya hoga
 But the procession coming in a house in Indore is different, it is different
 kyonki is baraat main duulhaa na to ghodi par savaar ho kar aa rahaa he, na car main
 He is lying on the stretcher, and will be lying on the stretcher
 22 farvari ko hone vaali ye shaadi kai myanon main alag he
 You must be thinking that the boy will be ill and the marriage date cannot be postponed, so he is coming on the stretcher right now and everything will be fine after marriage
 lekin aisa nahin he
 The boy has been on a stretcher for the last five years
 ek durghatana main uske puure sharir ko lakva maar gaya or gardan ke neeche kaa uskaa puraa hissaa ab hilta-dulata nahin
 For the past five years, he is full of dead bodies
 lekin paanch saal pehle wo hansata-kheltaa ek swasth ladkaa tha or jab wo swasth ladkaa tha, tabhi is ladki se uski dosti hui thi
 The two started falling in love with each other and then the accident happened
 ladkaa batch to gaya, lekin doctoron ne kah diya ki wo ab kabhi apane paanv par khadaa nahin ho saktaa
 After this accident, the girl's family members stopped her daughter from going to the boy's house
 ladke ke maa-baap ne bhi sakht manaahi kar di ki wo ladki unke bete se nahin mil sakati
 But the girl did not give up, she continued her studies
 naukari pai or apane paanv par khadi ho gai
 She used to go to the boy's house while coming to office
 ladke ke maa-baap use ladke se milane nahin dete
 But the girl never said anything
 wo ghar jaati, baahar yun hi baithi rahati
 Finally one day the boy's old parents' heart melted
 unhone ladki ko usase milane kii ijaajat di or ladki ladke se mili
 The boy's entire body is paralyzed
 ladki usase milti or donon kii ankhen baaten karatin, bahut si baaten
 Sayings of love, words of past and things
 sab ne bahut samajhaayaa, ladki ko bataaya ki uski jindagi barbaad ho jaaegi
 But the girl was not ready to listen to anyone
 use kisi or kaa saath nahin chahie tha
 He needed, just with whom he had spent four moments of love
 aakhir majaboor hokar ladki or ladke ke maa-baap ne hami bhar di or isi hami ke boote aaj 22 farvari ko ladki ko uski chahat se milane kaa mauka mil jayega, sadaa sadaa ke liye
 The old parents of the boy probably agreed that they later felt that at least the girl would take care of their son after them and in addition to bowing to the wish of the girl standing on her feet near the girl's parents
 There was no other option left
 mujhe nahin pataa ki is shaadi kaa anjaam kya hoga, lekin main jaananaa chahta hum ki is rishte ko main kya naam duungaa? agar aapke paas koi jawaab ho to jarur dijiega
 Will wait

 The book will be available at all online bookstores from 25 February
 philhal kitaab kii pribooking chaalu he
 Here are four satires from this book
 1
 Bossboss are often perfectionists, because if there is a slight spelling mistake, the bass will start coming from the boss
 agar convent main padhe chaatr hindi main likhen to bos kaa baans bhi ho saktaa he
 But why would the students studying in the convent write the boss in Hindi? Therefore, the boss can never be bamboo
 balki sarvamaanya tathy yahi he ki jo baans karne kii sabase adarsh sthiti main hota he, vahi bos hota he
 Boss is an English word
 lekin bhashaa badalane se bos kaa kairactor nahin badalata
 In government offices of Hindi areas, the boss is called an officer
 yani yahaan bhi matlab vahi he jo baans kare wo bos or jo sadhikaar padaa sake wo padaadhikari
 Bosses are enamored with positive energy
 ek acha bos kabhi kisi karmchaaree kii naa nahin sunata or kabhi kisi baat par haa nahin kahata
 The ideal boss is always democratic
 kai bos itane loktantric hote hai ki wo apni har baat par karmchaariyon ko raay rakhane kaa vikalp dete hai
 Now it depends on the employee to say very well or just say good
 bos ko hameshaa apane faisle ke bare main bahut acha sunne kii aadat hoti he
 But even if someone calls the decision of a liberal boss only good, he does not consider it bad
 bos ke aate hi daftar kaa puraa maahaul atyant garimamay ho jaataa he
 Work is worship, in this sense the office is the temple
 lekin mandir kii praan pratishtha tabhi hoti he, jab bos ke shubh charan padate hai
 As soon as the boss arrives, the empty cup of tea goes into the dustbin
 tahal rahe karmchaaree apni seat par chale jate hai or kursi par adlete computer game khel rahe log excel shit khol is tanmayata ke baith jatehain ki bos ko ye kahana pade ki agar isi tarah ankhe gadaaye rahoge to chashme kaa power bad jayega
 The neck will swell and one day there will be espandillitis
 lekin bos inamen se kuch bhi nahin kehete
 He mostly walks into his cabin, ignoring the salutations, shaking his head lightly on some salutations, passing a sweet on Hello and passing a naughty sea smile on some Hello
 karmchaaree dhanya hokar dekhte hai
 This energy level at this age! Then, mind-to-mind explain themselves, don't forget to talk about their age to anyone else
 nahin to naukari chali jaaegi
 Bosses pass 50 yards in a staff-filled office, as the world's greatest batsman travels from the dressing room at the Eden Gardens Stadium to the ground, or the President of the United States is one of the countries of a third world
 After the day's journey his special moves towards Boeing
 achche bos ke paas daftar kii har samasya kaa hal hota he
 But he never tells himself the solution but asks the employees
 kuch bos is kadar street forward hote hai ki sidhe-sidhe kehete hai ki bos ke paas sirf sawaal hote hai, jawaab nahin
 But for the employees, the boss is a question in itself
 ek sawaal nahin bos kai sawaal hota he
 How is it still lasting? What has it given to the management? When it leaves the office in the evening, why does its car stand far away from the parking lot? Who already sits in the car, etc
 jigyaasuon se bos ko bahut chidh hoti he kyonki bos kii har baat main ek gaharaa sens hota he or daftar ke baaki logon kii zyaadaatar baaten noncens hoti hai
 In addition to being a sense, the boss also has a great sense of humor
 bos agar muskuraayen to puraa daftar khilakhilaa uthta he or agar bos ne kabhi galati se tahaakaa laga diya to phir daftar gabbar ke adde main tabdeel ho jaataa he
 Laughter does not take the name of stopping until the boss's laughter stops
 achche bos kaa unke maatahaton ke saath rishta aamtaur par asantosh kaa hota he
 Employees are dissatisfied with the behavior of the boss and the way the boss works
 karmchaariyon ke kaam yaa idia ko khaarij karne ke saath bos yathochit fatkaar bhi lagaate hai
 But only two-four people in the whole office can understand that the relationship between the boss and the employee is like a potter and a pitcher, who removes the fault only for his good
 jo log yah baat samaj jate hai unki bharpoor tarakkee hoti he
 Such people consider themselves pitchers and bosses as potter gurus
 lekin daftar ke baaki log unhen bos kaa chamachaa bataate hai
 Bosses are different
 privet sector ke kuch bos nirgun or niraakaar hote hai
 No one knows when the offices come and when they go
 kai bos america, europe yaa bangalore main kahin baithkar i-mail ke zariye puraa daftar chalaate hai
 On the other hand government bosses are not formless but are so big in size that they barely fit in the chair
 privet sector ke zyaadaatar bos fitness freeq hote hai or gym jate hai
 On the other hand, the bosses of government offices believe in 'jimene' instead of gym
 sarkari daftaron ke bos is kadar jimate hai ki daftar ke babu logon ko subah se shaam tak unke naam par donon hatho maal batorna padataa he
 But the government boss does not fill his stomach
 vaayu vikaar unhen hota he, lekin padata he sarkari daftaron ke chakkar kaatanevaala

 lokapal bolaa, naa ompal naa sompaal
 i am the biggest surma of this arena
 koi takkar denevaala ho to saamne aaye
 All the wrestlers shied away
 mukhiya ji ne lokapal ko kinare le jaakar samajhaayaa, tumhaare jod kaa yahan naa koi he, naa hoga
 You have won this riot many times
 gaanv main vakt kyon barbaad karte ho? tumhen maaloom nahin tum kitne bade aadmi ho
 Anna Hazare is looking for you
 lokapal chakraayaa, ye kya bol rahe hai, mukhiya ji?mukhiya ji ne kaha, main sach bol rahaa hum
 Anna Hazare has said that i want Lokpal and that too the strongest
 kya tum kisi aise lokapal ko jaanate ho jo tumse zyada majboot ho?lokapal ne dimag daudaya or bolaa, paas vaale gaanv main the to ek pandit lokapal sharma
 But he was elderly, suffering from asthma, passed away last year
 baaki to aasapaas koi or nahin, ek akelaa lokapal main hi hoon
 The chief said, then you have confirmed your claim
 anna hajaare kah rahe the ki majboot lokapal kii mujhe nahin puure desh ko talash he
 Cut the ticket immediately and leave for Delhi
 train main bheed bahut thi
 Lokpal somehow reached Delhi hanging
 stesan par kadam rakhte hi use maaloom ho gaya ki puri dilli ko usee kaa intazaar he or uske swaagat ke liye ramlila maidan main ek bada jalsa bhi he
 Without losing time, the Lokpal went directly to Ramlila Maidan
 deevaaron par poster lage the- lokapal lao desh bachaao
 Lokpal shook the head of mind and went ahead and reached the man who was shouting loudly - Lokpal will come
 'ji main aa gaya’ lokapal ne adab se kaha
 But the slogan shouted like the Lokpal was unheard and then tearing the throat and screaming, the Lokpal will come
 bheed ne bhi naaraa doharaaya— aakar rahegaa lokapal
 'but the Lokpal has arrived
 ekadam majboot jaisaa aap log chaahate the
 "what this man is saying is praising the government ombudsman
" lagata he, congress kaa agent he
 Hey brother, the Lokpal has not come which we are looking for
 inhen kinare bithaiye ye kaarykram main khalal daalana chaahate hai
 'two activists took the Lokpal to the shore and made him sit in the crowd
 lokapal thodi der tak khamoshi se jalsa dekhtaa rahaa, lekin duniya ke saamne hokar bhi naa pahachaanaa janaa uske ke liye naakaabil-e-bardaasht tha
 Finally, his patience is broken and he shouts loudly - i am the Lokpal
 kaaryakarta phir uske paas pahunch gayi or samajhaayaa ki ye galat naaraa he
 Do not say that i am the Lokpal
 bolo main bhi anna, tum bhi anna
 Raise the slogan - Real Lokpal will come lokapal ne kaha, shreemanji jab main aa hi chukaa hoon to ye kaise kah saktaa hoon ki main aakar rahoonga
 When i am Lokpal, how can i call myself Anna? bahut gadabadjhaalaa he yahan, ab to mujhe sidhe anna hajaare ji se hi milanaa padegaa
 Badhwas Lokpal kept trying to reach Anna's stage at Ramilala Maidan, but it was morning to evening
 phir elaan hua ki sarkaar ke aashwaasan ke baad anna anshan tod rahe hai
 The crowd started coming out after raising the flag, but disappointed Lokpal stood in the corner of Ramlila Maidan
 use naa to anna mili naa ann kaa ek dana
 After spending four days in the gurudwara, Lokpal was about to return to the village after a conversation between two people revealed that Anna was fasting in Mumbai to bring Lokpal
 jila jind, gaanv khaparauli ke utsaahi lokapal ne bina vakt ganvaaye mumbai kii gaadi pakad lee
 As the MMRD stepped into the fray, the Lokpal came to know that the health of Anna ji on a hunger strike has suddenly deteriorated and now he will not meet anyone, neither from the media nor from his supporters
 lokapal ne bahut koshish kii, lekin kisi ne use anna se milane nahin diya
 Anna left Pune from Mumbai without testing the strength of a strong Lokpal
 lutaa-pita lokapal gaanv lautaa to mukhiya ji ne bataaya ki anna ko ho-naa-ho lekin aam aadmi ke netaa arvind kejariwal ko shartiya tumhaari zarurat he
 The staunch Lokpal once turned to Delhi
 lekin dilli pahonchte hi use pataa chalaa ki ek bahut majboot lokapal jaisaa anna chaahate the, vaisaa hi lokapal sansad main aa chukaa he
 Lokpal got dizzy
 use found rahe the, kejariwal
 Anna told the address and brought Congress and BJP people
 lekin wo to sadak par khadaa he, sansad main kahan he? chakit, bhramit lokapal sansad kii taraf badha lekin suraksha main mustaid police waalon ne use danda markar bhaga diya
 The Lokpal cried to Kejriwal's house for justice
 baahar tainaat kaaryakartaaon ko usne parichay diya to kaaryakartaaon ne samajhaayaa- lokapal mat kaho, bolo main aam aadmi hoon
 Lokpal is very soft, Kejriwal does not need it
 unhen to ek majboot janalokapal chahie
 Lokpal fell on gush
 kai maheene biit chuke hai
 a man with a large beard and torn pajamas shouts loudly in Shahdara's asylum, sometimes saying, i am the Lokpal
 phir kahata he
 i am Jan Lokpal
 kabhi kahata he, main bhi anna tum bhi anna
 Sometimes, i am a common man
 doctoron kaa kahana he ki is namaaloom shaks ko 'multiple persenality disoder’ naam kii beemaari he, jo kabhi thik nahin ho sakati
 On the front page, read 'mother tongue' and 'old age sticks'
 maatrubhashavyakti jis bhashaa main dusron kii maa-bahanon ko yaad karata he, vahi uski maatrubhaasha hoti he
 This may be a readily accepted definition of mother tongue
 lekin bharatvarsh main paraayon ko yaad karne ke liye paraai bhashaa ke istemaal kaa chalan lagaataar bad rahaa he
 Now abuses are also given in English
 isliye maatrubhaasha kii paribhaasha hamaare liye kuch badal gai he
 With a few disagreements, it can be assumed that the language that you can do the most, mother tongue is your mother tongue
 is khaanche main fitkar ke dekhen to hindi ke maatrubhaasha hone main koi shaq nahin rah jaataa
 When the country became independent, Hindi mother was handed over to the government babus
 baabuon ne kaha—maai, chintaa mat karo
 Now you will rule everywhere
 tumhaara khyaal rakhane ke liye har sarkari daftar main ek adhikari rakhaa jayega
 Whose job would be to write a word of your name on the blackboard daily and organize an event in your honor on September 14 every year
 hindi adhikari tumhaare liye yada-kada kavi sammelan bhi karwaaeg
 In which the fare and railway expenses will be given to the incoming poets
 dekhnaa maai,sarkari prayaas se kis tarah kashmir se kanyakumari tak log tumhaari jai-jayakaar karenge
 Hindi said, what is my age now? mere maathe par bindi lagaakar kyon mujhe maai banaate ho
 i can walk my own way
 lekin baabuon ne kaha, mataji aisa kaise ho saktaa he
 What will happen to our job if you walk your way? aapke naam par desh-videsh main sammelan kaise honge
 How will leaders and babus get foreign travel opportunities in focus and then we are serving you only
 lekin hindi kahan thaharne vaali thi, apni raftaar se chalane lagi 
 As the Gujarat and Maharashtra Parkars moved south, the uproar began
 hindi mata ke sapoot madras se lekar madurai tak jagah-jagah pitnelge
 Signboards started being erased
 hindi ke kilaaf raajnneetik slogan banaaye jane lage
 Fearful of seeing all this, uncle Nehru took the news of his babus, 'you had told me, do not leave the Hindi mother unbridled like this
 hindi mata kaa tamil ammaa ke ilaake main kya kaam
 They do not know how dangerous the area is
 agar unhen or unke sapooton ko kuch ho gaya to main puure desh ko kya jawaab doongaa
 Uncle Nehru explained to the whole country that okay, Hindi is our mother
 lekin alag-alag rajyon main jitani bhi mausiyaan hai, wo bhi maan samaan hai
 The aunts have no hatred for Hindi mother
 lekin mausere bhaaiyon kaa main kuch nahin kah saktaa
 Therefore, this is the direct way to take rest under the supervision of Hindi mothers
 apane hartland se nikalakar kahin baahar naa jaayen
 Uncle Nehru also told the country that do not forget that you also have a ancestral language
 bhartiya samaaj main baap kaa darja maan se bada hota he
 You will always be able to do nothing in life if you keep your mother's pallu
 maatrubhaasha lori sunne ke liye hi thik he
 If you want to earn bread in India, then learn English
 puraa desh chachaa ke dikhaaye raah par chal padaa
 The result was that everywhere the rule of the Englishman's father was established and Hindi Mata became a housewife

 Sticks of old age were lying on the bed
 chot bahut gahari thi, sharir par kam or man par bahut zyada
 In this time of crisis, most of them had left their company
 ikkaa-dukka hamdard aa rahe the or unki haalat par ansu bahaakar waapas laut ja rahe the
 The pain had passed
 chot laailaaj thi
 Because this injury was not of anything else but of old age sticks
 upar vaale kii lathi main awaz nahin hoti, lekin budhaape kii lathi main bahut awaz hoti he
 When the old age sticks, the whole world comes to know
 jivan kaa ye mahaan satya unki samaj main acchhee tarah aa chukaa tha
 But now what was the benefit of repenting, the sticks had already fallen
 ek vakt tha, jab ve aksar kaha karte the- lathi sushasan he
 Sticks are discipline
 lathi swadeshi he
 Lathi is self-reliance
 lathi shakti he
 Lathi is on, ban and swabhamin
 lathi par desh main honevaale aakadamik chintanon main unka bahut bada yogadan tha
 He often repeated his resolve to embody this thought
 immergency ke dinon main unhone loktantr bahaali kii ladaai bhi ladi thi
 Then he thought that there is sticks, then there is democracy, otherwise everything is unrestrained
 lathi ko tel pilaaye jane or use shastrochit sammaan diye jane ke paksh main hameshaa se rahe the
 However, they do not believe that old age will ever come
 phir bhi ve apane liye budhaape kii ek lathi taiyaar kar rahe the, thik vaise hi jaise har bhartiya karata he
 People were warning them in the same way as neighbors and relatives give them - the era is very bad
 sagi aulad tak kaa bharosa nahin he
 The stick of your old age is very uninteresting
 isliye sambhaal kar rakhiye, kahin budhaape main sahaara banane ke badale aap par hi naa barasane lage
 His answer was, this lathi is not for unruly but to rein
 apni budhaape kii lathi ke chakkar main unhone naa jane kitne taane, kitne bol sahe lekin lathi ko tel pilaanaa nahin choda
 They had seen countless spring
 saathi ek-ek karke guzar rahe the
 But his days were passing in great fun
 sir par utane bal ab bhi bache the, jitne bees saal pehle bache the
 The wrinkles were intermittent once they fell
 awaz main ab bhi utani hi bulandi thi, jitani tees-chalis baras pehle thi
 The whole country believed that he is the only one who can save the honor and self-respect of the entire country
 kyonki zarurat padane par unhen lathi chalaane or chalavane se parhez nahin
 His party came to power thrice for 13 days, thirteen months and five years
 ve mantri bane phir up-pradhanmantri bhi ban gayi, lekin pradhanmantri banane kaa vakt aayaa to naa jane kyon sasura ek adad in vatting unke naam ke saath aakar chipak gaya
 The party was about to depart for victory under his leadership, but did not know how Feelgood became enemies
 ab loha ho yaa louh purush agar bahut din tak bekaar padaa rahe to jang laganaa shuru ho hi jaataa he
 But he kept brushing off the war on the body with vigor and also declared the next election as a battle
 unhone ek baar phir abaki baari kaa naaraa diya or apane dam par kud pade maidan main
 But hi! Mu 'in waiting', this time also sticking together
 ve apni naakaami par maathaa thokate rahe
 On the other hand, his sticks which have become healthy after drinking oil continuously kept on whimpering, as if you are saying, "hey, leave it to me, i will show you the stars in the day
" lathi kii awaz aisi thi ki virdohi to virdohi kai baar ve khud bhi dar jate the
 They had failed in two attempts
 chunaav phir se aanevaala tha
 The old dream of removing these waiting from PM in Waiting was once again becoming increasingly common in his mind
 lekin parivaaravaalon ne saaf kah diya, ham aapako zyada kudane-phandane nahin denge
 If you fall and fall, there will be trouble
 buudhe aadmi ko ghar main rahakar hari bhajan karnaa chahie
 He was very disappointed
 ab unke liye budhaape kii lathi kaa hi sahaara tha
 It was expected that with the help of sticks, he would enter 7 races
 raste main jo aayega, use lathi nibata degi
 But his sticks were no longer sticks, but he got stuck
 chachaa choudhary ke bhimseni latth kii takat or apane aap ud-udakar dushmano ko maarane vaale taoojee kii jaadu kii chadi kaa karishma, donon us lathi main samaa chuke the
 Family members explained, this sticks is not a common old age sticks, but now it has become such an automatic weapon that does not run by anyone but runs on its own
 us lathi ko thaamne ke liye jitani takat chahie, wo ab aapmen nahin he
 Sit silently and take the name of Ram
 lekin ve ruuth gayi
 The family celebrated him
 ve maan gayi
 But after a few days, i was angry again
 parivaar waalon ne phir se manaaya
 But they were not ready to accept this time
 aage badhkar budhaape kii lathi thaamne nikle
 But as soon as i put my hand, it felt like current
 vaaki is lathi ko sanbhaalanaa unke boote se baahar tha
