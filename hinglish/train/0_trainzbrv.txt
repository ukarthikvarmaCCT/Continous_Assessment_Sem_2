 pulavama aatanki hamale kii china ne kadi ninda kii he
 On Saturday, China's State Counselor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said he was stunned when he came to know that a suicide attack had taken place in Kashmir and caused a large number of security casualties
 aatankwaad maanavtaa kaa ek aam dushman he
 The Chinese side strongly opposes all forms of terrorism and strongly condemns it
 china ke baad pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne bhi pulavama aatankwaadi hamale kii ninda kii
 Shah Mahmood Qureshi, who went to Germany to attend the Munich Security Conference, said that without investigation, India immediately blamed the attack on Pakistan without thinking
 yadi bharat is ghatana ke sambandh main pakistan ke saath koi saboot saajha karata he to pakistan jaanch main puraa sahyog karegaa
 He said that it is easy to hold Pakistan responsible, but this will not solve the problem and the world will not be ready to accept it
 hamaara sandesh shanti kaa he na ki sangharsh: pakistankuraishi ne kaha ki hame maaloom he ki apni raksha kaise kii jaae
 We too can put our perspective before the world
 hamaara sandesh shanti kaa he na ki sangharsh kaa
 If India has any evidence (about Pakistan's involvement in elements in the Pulwama attack), it should share it with us
 ham puri eemaandaaree se jaanch karenge or dekhenge ki kya yah (saboot) sahi he
 i say with confidence that we will cooperate
 kyonki ham koi ashaanti nahin chaahate hai
 PM Modi had warned, 40 CRPF jawans were martyred in Pulwama's suicide attack of jaish-e-mohammed
 is hamale ko lekar pakistan ko kadi chetavanee dete hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne shuukravaar ko elaan kiya ki jo bhi jimmedaar he, use baari keemat chukaani hogi
 China's double stance, India has been demanding globally that Masood Azhar, the leader of Jaish, be put on the list of global terrorists
 agar ajahar ko sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kii aatankwaadiyon kii suchi main daalaa jaataa he to usapar duniya bhar main yatra karne par roak lagegi or uski sampattiyon ko jabt kar liya jayega
 China has veto powers on the UN Security Council and is a close ally of Pakistan
 china ajahar ko vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit karne kii raah main kai baar roda atka chukaa he
 He first stalled on India's move and then stopped the efforts of America, Britain and France
 is hamale ke baad china ne gaharaa dukh jataayaa tha, lekin is baat kaa koi aashwaasan nahin diya tha ki unka desh ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki kii suchi main shaamil karne kii bharat kii apil kaa samarthan karegaa

 is baar unhone is sawaal kaa jawaab diya
 Dhoni said in response to the question that you are not going to get rid of me so soon
 bangladesh ko aage bhi meraa saamana karnaa padegaa
 Now Dhoni gave this answer so that he should not be asked this question before and during the world and more than his retirement, the focus was on the team's performance and matches, but this answer clearly means that Dhoni has to give you the World Cup
 After all, they will continue to play and the way the Indian team performs, it is unlikely that they will retire from this format soon
 tippaniyan By the way, on being asked this question of Indian journalists continuously, Dhoni had earlier given some similar answer as to why you want to get me out of the team, but when asked this question again and again, Dhoni said that the question i have given the answer 15 days ago, it will not change now
 aap ek hi sawaal baar-baar puuchhenge, to jawaab nahin badalane vaala
 Something like that my name will be Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 chaliye dhoni apane is jawaab ke baad ummid yahi kar rahe honge ki ab dobaaraa se is sawaal kaa unhen nikat samay main saamana nahin karnaa padegaa, lekin patrkaar kya unka peechha chodenge
 It will be interesting to see
 dhoni ne sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki aapako mujhase itani jaldi chhutkaaraa nahin milane ja rahaa
 Bangladesh will have to face me even further
 ab dhoni ne ye jawaab isliye diya ki world se pehle or uske dauraan unase dobaaraa ye sawaal na poocha jaae or unke sanyas se zyada focus team ke pradarshan or maichon par rahe, lekin is jawaab kaa saaf matlab yah he ki dhoni ko aap vishwa cap ke baad bhi khelte dekhte rahenge or jis tarah se bhartiya team kaa pradarshan he, to lagata nahin ki wo jaldi hi is fomert se sanyas lenge
 The comments vaise, bhartiya patrakaron ke nirantar is sawaal ke puche jane par dhoni ne pehle to kuch aisa hi jawaab diya tha ki aap mujhe team se baahar kyon karwaanaa chaahate hai, lekin baar-baar yahi sawaal puche jane par pichhali baar dhoni ne kaha ki jis sawaal kaa jawaab main 15 din pehle de chukaa hum wo ab badal to nahin jayega
 If you ask the same question over and over again, the answer is not going to change
 kuch us tarah se jaise meraa naam mahendra singh dhoni hi rahegaa
 Let Dhoni be hoping that after this answer, now he will not have to face this question again in near time, but will the journalists give up his chase
 ye dekhnaa dilachasp hoga

 This maneuver is being done in three groups

 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ravivaar ko madhya pradesh ke sidhi ke churhat main ek chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue achaanak ruk gaye or peeche gum gaye
 After this, he whispered to a colleague in a Gujarati speech
 is ghatana ke baad sabhi kii nigahen amit shah kii taraf thahar gayi
 Actually, Amit Shah started his speech and took BJP candidate from Churhat assembly seat named Sharadendu Tiwari and stayed
 wo bhaashan kii copy main baaki vidhansabhaon or ummidavaaron ke naam khojane lage, lekin unako bhaashan kii copy main churhat ke alaava kisi duusare vidhansabha or ummidavaar kaa naam nahin mila
 Amit Shah told the public, 'welcome all of you, Sarandu Tiwari
 main unako jitaane ke liye yahaan aayaa hum
 After speaking so much, Amit Shah was surprised to see the copy of the speech kept in the podium
 iske baad peeche palate
 He then shows a copy of the speech asking his colleague in Gujarati that apart from Churhat, the names of other constituencies are missing
 
 
 
 
 aapane kuch likhaa nahin he?iske baad unke sahyogi bhaashan kii copy kii ore ishaara karte hai

 He alleged that the Kikangress is not a democratic party, which will elect the commander here
 congress nehru gandhi parivaar kii privet limited party he, jiske rashtriya adhyaksh niyukt kiye jate hai, wo bhi gandhi parivaar se
 No one else is made the president of the Congress party
 bataa den ki congress party ne abhi tak madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri pad ke liye kisi ummidavaar ke naam kaa elaan nahin kiya he
 The Congress party landed on the election ground without a chief ministerial face
 vahiin, loksabhaa chunaav ke liye abhi kaaphi samay he, lekin usase pehle rahul gandhi khud ko pradhanmantri kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar chuke hai
 BJP president Amit Shah has attacked the Congress and the Gandhi family for this
 mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit nahin karne par modi ne congress par ksaa tanjaiske alaava piem modi ne bhimadhya pradeshmen congress party kii ore se mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa elaan nahin karne par tanj ksaa

 ravivaar ko madhya pradesh ke churhat main chunavi jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue amit shah ne kaha, 'bijepi kii parampara he, jab ham chunaav main jate he, to palapal or pai-pai kaa hisaab dete hai
 He said that the Congress is such an ATM, in which the answer does not come in development after putting problems, but comes out in false promises and BJP is the ATM of development

 Dhoni: Cricketer, captain or clever politician at first glance at the figures
 saal 2000 se 2010 tak bharat ne videshon main 41 test khele, sirf 14 haare
 But 15 of the 23 Tests played since 2011 have been lost
 yah mahendra singh dhoni kaa daur he
 While the country performed brilliantly in limited overs matches, winning titles, the oldest format of cricket is constantly being beaten
 iske alaava dilachasp tathy yah he ki tii20 or vanade muqablon main jahaan hamaari team ekajute najar aati he, vahiin test ke dauraan aapasi manmutav, jhagadon ke kisse saamne aate hai
 The latest case is of Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan
 khabar ai ki gaba test ke chauthe din donon ke bich hathapayee kii naubat aa gai
 On Thursday, Dhoni gave this clarification in a very sarcastic tone
 bataaya ki haa, kohli ne chaaku se dhawan par waar kiya
 We sent him for batting as soon as he was well
 dhoni phir gambhir hue ki hamaare jis bhi khilaadi ne yah afvaah udayi he, use team india ke bajaae koi film company jwine kerani chahie, jahaan aisi kaalpanik kahani kaa upyog hota he
 Now the 3 things that emerge from this whole case are something like this - 1
 dhoni jis shanti ke saath apni baat rakh rahe the, uskaa matlab yah tha ki team main manmutav kii baat (afvaah hi sahi), unhen jaraa bhi vichlit nahin kar rahi thi
 2
 ve is kahani ke janm ke peeche kisi khilaadi ke hone kii baat kar rahe the to yah tay he ki unki captaini par sabhi khilaadiyon ko ek jaisaa bharosa nahin he
 That means pique
 3
 If the Kohli and Dhawan controversy is a rumor and Dhoni is confident about the unity of the team, then what was the point of involving another player in the controversy, that he is sparking the rumor
 kahin aisa to nahin ki aisa unhone apni kharaab captaini ko lekar aa rahi khabaron kaa rukh modane ke liye kiya
 In the Test series held during the last four years itself, there were reports of controversies related to Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan
 sachai to kabhi pataa nahin chali, lekin dhire-dhire ye sabhi team india se baahar hote chale gaye
 Captain survived every time
 aamtaur par aisa raajnneetik dalon main dikhataa he, jahaan satta yaa padon kii khinchataan ko lekar aisi khabaren aati hai
 Or to divert attention from an election defeat

 vot ke liye note maamle main kathith sanliptata ke aaropee samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke purv mahasachiv amar singh kii jamaanat yachika par bahes ke dauraan bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke saansad or varisht vakil ram jethmalani ne kaha ki 2008 main hue vishwaas prastaav ke dauraan saansadon ke ghoose dene ke liye dhan unke muvakkil kii ore se nahin aayaa balki yah 'sambhavat: bhaajapa ke strot se aayaa
 Jethmalani said in the court of Special Judge Sangeeta Dhingra Sehgal, “there is no charge against Amar Singh for raising money and giving money to anyone
 " jethmalani ne apni daleel main kaha, "haal hi main loksabhaa main laalkrishna adwani ne kaha tha ki yah sting bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) dwaara pryojit tha
 
 
 The money may have come from some source of BJP
 singh ne yah paisa uplabdh nahin karaayaa
 The sting was done to uncover corruption
 isse spasht hota he ki unhone jo kuch bhi kiya vah gaiyrkanoonee nahin tha
 "he said that the sting operation in this case was carried out by the private channel CNN-IBN and its purpose was to expose corruption, so what was done by the mps was nothing illegal
 jethmalani ne adaalat se kaha, "sah aaropee or kathith madhyasth sanjeev saxena (amar singh ke sahyogi) ne adaalat main purv main die apane bayaan main kaha he ki usne bhaajapa saansadon ko paise die
 And in such a situation when the BJP is claiming that it was its sting operation, the money must have come from the party's fund itself
 " ullekhneey he ki vot ke liye note maamle main amar singh (55) chah sitambar ko giraftaar kiye gaye the or adaalat ne unhen 19 sitambar tak nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya tha

 Every effort has been made to keep the user interface simple

 There is an under display fingerprint scanner near the bottom of the screen
 khaas baat ye he ki phone kii disple on nahin he, phir bhi aap screen kii bottm jaise hi tach karenge under disple fingerprint sensor kaam karegaa or phone analock hoga
 This smartphone is much better for multi tasking, can run multiple apps simultaneously

 There are many features in the camera, there are so many features that you will be confused about what to use and what not
 agar aapako clin camera interphes pasand he to ye aapke liye thodaa sa pareshaani bharaa jarur ho saktaa he
 But if you like to use different features from the camera, then it does not matter

 Grain will be seen a lot in photos
 hai rej photography ke liye aapako settings main ja kar actevet karnaa hoga
 The colors and contrast in photos are correct, but it takes some time to focus
 ise or fast hona chahie tha

 But its final quality will probably not affect you
 selfi kii baat karen to yahaan ye smartphone prabhavit karata he
 The details will be seen in the clicked selfie and the quality will also be good
 Galaxy S10 siries jaisaa selfi ke liye mod isamen bhi diya gaya he
 The selfie camera has only one lens, but here you get the option of wide and zoomed mode
 ek lens hone kii vajah se juum karne ke liye company ne software tricks kaa yuj kiya he
 Through the software, the company has also given the feature of portrait mode in selfie camera
 yahaan bhi ye thik thaak hi kaam karata he
 Portrait mode, which is clicked like separates the background properly from the subject and also blurs, but if there is something on your face or the hair is more moving here then this portrait mode fails
 Bottom line – Samsung Galaxy A70kaa camera acha he
 Photos are good clicks, especially for selfies, this smartphone is more good
 video ke liye bhi behatar he
 Battery Samsung Galaxy A70 has a battery of 4,500mah
 phone kii bydaree byaap decent he

 After the defeat in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections, the round of meetings in the Aam Aadmi Party has started
 der raat mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne vidhayakon ke saath baithak kii jisamen chunaav ke dauraan hui galatiyon or iviem par bhi charchaa hui
 Party spokesperson Sanjay Singh said after the meeting that the party needed change and some changes would be made
 unhone kaha ki party apni kamiyon ko dur karne kii koshish karegi
 In a meeting with legislators and new councilors, Arvind Kejriwal had said that if you guys betrayed this movement, then you should understand that this god has cheated
 ek baar ho saktaa he ki koi aapako laalach de de yaa 10 karod rupee de de ki party chhodkar aa jaao
 They have a lot of money, they can give anything but thinking of one thing, if you betray this movement and the hope of this party and people, then you will not be happy in life
 usase dogune, teen gune paise bhagwaan aapse nichod legaa or wo badi kathinaayee se nichodega
 Will squeeze you through pain
 yah khabar saamne aane ke baad aam aadmi party or arvind kejariwal ke rukh ko lekar sawaal uthne lage ki kya arvind kejariwal ko apane parshadon or vidhayakon par bharosa nahin he yaa phir vah parshadon ko bhagwaan kaa dar dikhaa rahe hai
 Are councilors greedy? Or is Arvind Kejriwal afraid? in sawaalon kaa jawaab sanjay singh ne enditivi ko diya ki arvind kejariwal ishwar main vishwaas rakhte hai
 So often he says that God has given us the responsibility, which needs to be fulfilled properly
 is baat ko anaavashyak kii tool diya ja rahaa he
 When people have chosen him for faith in the Aam Aadmi Party, he should also work
 pavitra uddeshy ke liye ek mishan ke tahat aaen hai to party ke saath kaam karnaa chahie
 Why would God forgive a cheating person? tippaniyan After this news came out, questions were raised about the stand of Aam Aadmi Party and Arvind Kejriwal whether Arvind Kejriwal does not trust his councilors and mlas or he is showing fear of God to the councilors
 kya parshad laalchee hai? yaa phir arvind kejariwal dar rahe hai? Sanjay Singh answered these questions to NDTV that Arvind Kejriwal believes in God
 so aksar vah kehete hai ki ishwar ne hamen jimmedaari di he, jise sahi rup main nibhaana jaruri he
 This thing is being ruled unnecessary
 jab logon ne unhen aam aadmi party par vishwaas ke chalate chunaa he to unhen bhi kaam karnaa chahie
 If you come under a mission for a sacred purpose, then you should work with the party
 dhokhaa dene vaale vyakti ko ishwar kyon maaf karegaa
 The comments in sawaalon kaa jawaab sanjay singh ne enditivi ko diya ki arvind kejariwal ishwar main vishwaas rakhte hai
 So often he says that God has given us the responsibility, which needs to be fulfilled properly
 is baat ko anaavashyak kii tool diya ja rahaa he

 Whether it is about Kanpur accent or the streets to streets

 Tanuja Trivedi's look, Datto's way of life, the tone of his speech
 har kisi main kangana ne khud ko sabit kiya he

 Deepak Dobriyal (pappi) laughs on the viewer's face whenever he comes on screen
 jabaki paayal ke kirdaar main swara bhaskar or raja avasthi ke role main jimmy shergill ne kairactor ke saath nyaay kiya he
 Zeeshan Ayub has also emerged as a best performer
 sangeet paksh:film ke geet pehle hi chartbster main jagar bana chuke hai
 Along with 'swagger', 'move On', 'ghani Bawri', the song in this almost 2-hour film does not seem to be out of whack
 sonu nigam kaa gaae alaap ko aap bina mujeec ke bhi sun sakate hai
 Why Watch: Any film is actually a story, which the audience sees on the screen through the eyes of the writer and director
 'tanu vaids manu riterns' main lekhak himanshu sharma or diarector anand el raay ne koi kami nahin chodi he
 The film also carries a message with 200 percent entertainment

 Perhaps this is why Uddhav Thackeray, the Shiv Sena supremo who has attacked more than the opposition parties during the last one year, opened the door of Matoshree once again to BJP national president Amit Shah
 vahiin, amit shah ne bhi 2014 ke apane raajnneetik ahankaar, ati aatmavishvaas ko kinare rakhte hue loksabhaa main maatr do adhik siton par chunaav ladane or vidhansabha main baraabar baraabar siton par ladane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 How politically beneficial this decision is for both parties will tell the results of the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin baraabar- baraabar kaa formula jo pichley saal bihar se shuru hua wo maharashtra main bhi jari he, ek baar phir sabit karata he ki bhaajapa ko is baat kaa ahsaas he ki ek baar phir satta main waapas aane kaa sapana bina sahyogiyon ke saakaar nahin ho saktaa
 Hence, there are also speculations that if the results are favorable in the assembly elections, then the crown of power in the state for the power of the center can be given to Uddhav Thackeray's son Aditya Thackeray
 haalanki ye sari atakalein chunaav ke baad aane vaale parinaamon par hi nirbhar karte hai
 At present, allies are happy that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah like their allies
 isliye unke saath mail milaap or tol mol kaa daur bhi jari he
 However, experts say that the 2014 election was a kind of presidential election, the role of allies was also important in that election
 magar jab bijepi ne bahumat kaa aankada paar kar liya tab usne sahyogiyon ke sammaan kii parampara ko darkinar kar diya or centre ho yaa rajya har jagah satta main bhagidaari ke sawaal par bijepi haaavee rahi
 Because he believed that whatever number of seats have come is the result of the efficient leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the political management of Amit Shah
 lekin pichley saal 3 rajyon main satta khone ke baad shaayad bajapi ko is baat kaa abhas ho gaya he ki janata par modi kaa jaadu or amit shah kaa prabandhan ab feekaa padataa ja rahaa he
 At the same time, the Congress is emphasizing alliances from small to big states
 kshetreey dalon ne jaisaa ki uttar pradesh main sapa or basapa ne aapasi talmail ke alaava siton kaa samjhauta kiya, uske baad BJP ke paas apane puraane sahyogiyon ke paas jane or unki baat maanane ke alaava doosraa or koi vikalp nahin rah gaya tha
 This is why BJP decided to pre-announce a tie-up agreement with Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal United, which won two seats in Bihar
 bijepi ne bhi baraabar-baraabar siton par ladane ke faisle par muhar lagane main deree nahin kii or isi formule ko aadhaar banaakar maharashtra main bhi bijepi ne yahi elaan kiya, jahaan bijepi do siten zyada par shivasena ke saath chunaav ladegi
 However, in Maharashtra, BJP and Shiv Sena will contest on equal seats in the upcoming assembly elections
 iske baad ab tay mana ja rahaa he ki uttar pradesh main bhi jahaan sapa-basapa ke talmail ke baad voton ke khel main bhaajapa ab defensive he, vahaan sahyogiyon kii baat maanane ke alaava unke paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin he
 Apart from this, in the north, south states or north-east states, the Bharatiya Janata Party is now making every effort to either keep the old allies happy or go to the polls by adding new allies
 uttar-purv main jahaan bhartiya janata party ne pehle loksabhaa chunaav main kaaphi acha pradarshan karne kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi, magar vahaan citigenship bill ke baad aam logon ke saath-saath sahyogiyon main bhi naaraazgi hui
 After that the BJP did not even dare to introduce the bill in Rajya Sabha and now the BJP leaders are hoping that at least till the Lok Sabha elections, all the allies will at least jump out of their boat
 bhaajapa ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki 2014 kii tulana main 2019 kaa chunaav unke liye kaafii kathin he
 Here in the last Lok Sabha election, the Congress was supposed to go and the Congress allies were either keeping their distance from it or contested with them in an uncontrolled manner, due to which the entire election was a kind of election for the President of America
 It was done
 2014 main jahaan ek ore narendra modi the or duusari ore unako chunauti dene vaala koi nahin tha
 So that election was then considered a lamp post election
 jahaan logon ne bhaajapa ke ummidavaar ke naam jaanane kii bhi zarurat nahin samajhi or sidhe narendra modi ke naam par camel ke batan par apni ungali dabaa di
 But this time the situation is different
 kyonki congress ke saath yaa to kai nae sahyogi yaa puraane sahyogi ek baar phir talmail kar chunavi maidan main hai
 In a state like Bihar where the Congress has a negligible role, the Congress has presented a tough challenge to the BJP by signing a deal with the RJD to Upendra Kushwaha, Mukesh Sahni and Jeetan Ram Manjhi
 aise main bhaajapa ke paas sahyogiyon kaa haath pakadaney ke alaava shaayad hi koi vikalp bachaa ho
 Because in the 2014 election storm, BJP leaders, including then prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, had showered promises and announcements in the Lok Sabha constituencies
 magar vaadon par amal karne kii baat karen to 30 pratishat se adhik kaam tak bhi shuru nahin ho paaya he
 In such a situation, it is very important for the BJP as well as the allies and now reminds the BJP again and again that it will not be easy to cross the electoral waters without the allies
 asal main plastic kii botalon main dawaaiyon kaa vivaad 2013 se chal rahaa he
 In 2014, the Indian Council of Medical Research, ie ICMR, has also said that there is a dangerous element in the medicine given in plastic bottles
 saath hi kaha tha ki garbhvatee mahilaon or bacchon ko ye dawaaen na di jaayen
 So the question arises whether the government is under pressure from plastic manufacturers because in the matter of packaging these companies have been opposing any proposed ban of the government for the last two years

 jaruri ye he ki in baton ko samay rahete sambhaal liya jaae auraamane-saamne baithkar in masalon ko sulajhaalia jaae

 Then what happened now? Most couples stop giving importance to each other after marriage

 Why is it that the love that connected the two of you to each other, now both of you have no time for the same

 It is not right to ignore love in the process of work
 4
 It is right to have your own thinking and your own personal opinion, but every time you believe your own right and ignore your partner's mistake, it can ruin your relationship
 5
 No relationship can succeed unless efforts are made from both sides
 ekatarfa koshish kisi bhi rishte ko bahut aage nahin le ja sakati
 6
 agar aap donon ke bich bharosa or saajhedaari nahin he to aap donon ko baithkar baat karne kii jarurat he
 No relationship can move forward without trust and help from each other

 Film Name: Bhaag Johnidirector: Shivam Nairstar Cast: Kunal Khemu
 joa morani, mandana karimi, urvashi rautelfvadhi:118 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga: 1 stardiarector sivam nair ko aap tivi serial 'si hox' or 2006 kii film 'aahista aahista' ke liye jaanate hai
 This time Shivam has made a film 'bhaag Johnny' with Kunal Khemu and Joa Morani, let's know how this film is? Kahani This story is by Janardan aka Johny (kunal Khemu), who for some reason has two different at the same time Life is required to live, then such incidents happen one after the other due to which he has to run for the whole time
 isi bich johny kii mulaakaat tanya (joa morani ) se bhi hoti he
 In the film, both aspects of the coin are encouraged to think, now it is necessary to watch the film to know what happens in the life of Johnny and Tanya
 scriptfilm kii script kaaphi bhramit karne vaali he, ek insaan ko ek hi vakt par do alag-alag tarah se jindagi bitaate hue dekha jaataa he jo 21vinsadi ke hisaab se gadabad lagati he
 This is a story that fits only in the grandparents' stories
 itane achche loketions ke saath film kii kahani kaaphi dhili lagati he, ise or bhi behatar banaaya ja saktaa tha
 The film is very weak at the script level itself
 kabhi bhi kuch bhi hone lagata he or ant main khichdi ban jaati he
 Kunal Khemu's performance in Abhinayamfilm is fine and while Joa Morani, who is doing another film, needs to work more on the character as well as his look, Joa's lack of confidence in acting was evident
 maanasi scot kaa abhinay behtareen he or apane kirdaar ko unhone bakhubi nibhaayaa he
 Mukul Dev's work is good
 vikram bhatta bhi is film main dikhaai padate hai lekin unka abhinay bilkul bhi raas nahin aayaa, kaaphi over acting si dikhaai pad rahi thi
 Music: The music of the film is good but it is not used correctly in the film
 film ke gane film kii raftaar ko halkaa kar dete he
 Weak Link The weakest link is the script of the film, the locations are excellent but the story looks scattered, the story is as impossible as the audience in the 21st century
 kyon dekhegar aap kunal khemu ke diwane hai to hi yah film dekhen anyathaa kabhi naa kabhi to yah film tivi par aegi hi, tab tak intjaar kar lijiye
 What danger can a person of 107 years of age face in society? It was the same till Thursday with Chauthi Yadav of Balwan village in Gorakhpur
 107 varshiya chauthi yadav kii guuruuvaar ko gorakhpur jail se rihaai ke baad belaon gaanv main diwaali jaisaa maahaul tha
 The oldest prisoner in India, Chauthi Yadav was released after serving a 14-year sentence in a 38-year-old murder case
 chauthi yadav kii rihaai teen maheene purv upi ke rajyapal ram nike ke die aadesh kii vajah se mumkin ho saki
 The Governor, while exercising his constitutional rights, ordered the fourth Yadav Kirahiika
 iske liye us vakt kii sattadhari samaajawaadee party sarkaar ne 12 janvari 2017 ko sifarish kii thi
 Chauthi Yadav, a resident of Balwan village in Belipar police station area, came to get 96-year-old wife Sunra and nephew from jail
 rihaai ke baad chauthi yadav ne kaha ki unhen bekasoor is maamle main fansaaya gaya
 In fact, Chauthi Yadav was convicted in a murder case on 25 July 1979
 court ne 1982 main chauthi yadav ko dhara 302 main doshi pate hue umr kaid kii sajaa sunai
 Then this case went to the upper courts
 2003 main chauthi yadav ko jail bheja gaya
 The son of Chauthi Yadav is married in the Uruva police station area
 aarope ke mutabik chauthi yadav kii bete ke sasuraal waalon or gaanv ke dharmendra tiwari se marpet hui thi, jisame dharmendra tiwari ke chachaa kii maut ho gayi thi
 After this, a case of murder was registered in Uruva police station, in which Chauthi Yadav was named
 chauthi yadav ko kabhi varanasi jail to kabhi gorakhpurjelmen rakhaa gaya
 In 2015, the grandson of Chauthi Yadav requested the then Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for release citing age
 lekin chauthi yadav ko khuli hawa main saans lenaa jab naseeb hua to pradesh main yogi adityanath ke netritv vaali sarkaar astitv main aa chuki he
 Chauthi Yadav says that he had good relations with the staff and other prisoners in the jail
 chauthi yadav ke mutabik guuruuvaar ko jab unki rihaai kaa order aayaa to sabhi ne unhen nam ankhon se vidaai di
 There is a place in the country's capital where only 'clean' children can be entered
 baakiyon ke liye 'no entry' lagu he
 The term is of terms and conditions - hence the conditions are also applicable here
 yahaan se matlab dilli kii ek adaalat parisar main bane ek cretch se he
 Terms are short! Probably because it is a matter of young children
 ek cretch - jahaan sharten lagu hanye cretch ek aise parisar main he jahaan insaaf ke liye log fariyaad lekar aate hai
 However, this case is not directly connected to the court, but belongs to the same campus in which the temple of justice also resides
 magar maamla unase judaa he jinhen insaaf kaa matlab bhi nahin maaloom
 His parents are sad
 dukh kaa kaaran ek circular he jise jila adaalat ke administration ne jari kiya he
 What does this official decree say? The circular reads, 'crèche facilities are available on the third floor of the Rohini Court Complex for all two-and-a-half-year-old 12-year-old daughters and two-and-a-half-year-old sons of the North West and North District's judicial officers and ministerial staff
 'baat sirf itani hoti to utani nahin akharati
 The special thing is the conditions given in the circular which are surprising
 "yah suvidha staff ke bacchon ko tabhi milegi, jab cretch main afasaron ke bachche nahin honge or bachche saaf-suthere, higinic or beemaari rahit honge
 "staff children will get this facility only when the seat is vacant here
 aisa tabhi hogi jab isamen afasaron ke bachche nahin honge
 Even so, no one should have any objection nor to which member of staff
 aapatti aage kii sharton par he

 If the terrorists were able to break through the second circle, then the damage can only be estimated

 The great thing is that instead of taking responsibility for the attack, the effort is to save your neck

 If you see the sit-in demonstrations across the country, you will see a different picture of democracy
 kai baar ham pradarshnon ko vipakshi dalon ke hisaab se dekhte hai
 Those who are searching for the opposition should go to these demonstrations so that they know that there are demonstrations without the leaders of the opposition
 logon ne vipaksh kaa rasta dekhnaa bhi band kar diya he
 Look at it in such a way that there was a time when someone used to join these demonstrations, used to become a leader, but now that too has stopped
 lekin pradarshan band nahin hue hai
 The result of most of the performances may be zero, but everyone leaves a number on their side for the next performance and this goes on
 itani mushkilon ko paar kar desh ke kone kone se dilli aane ke iraade ko koi maap nahin saktaa
 When they came to Delhi after traveling for thirty hours from different states, they were meeting each other for the first time
 yahaan aane se pehle bhi chitthee patri karke dekh lee, twit karke dekh liya or court jaakar dekh liya or jab kuch nahin hua to sab aa gaye
 The government calls them Divyang, many are not happy with the word Divyang but even bigger issue is that whether you call them handicapped or handicapped, it does not reduce their problem
 varna to rail mantralay kaa koi inke bich aakar aashwaasan de rahaa hota yaa thos jawaab de rahaa hota
 Nowadays, all the sensitivity is seen in the posts of Twitter and Facebook, not on the ground
 2018 main railway bhartee board ke group di kii pariksha main jin viklangon kaa hua he, wo sab apni shikayaton ko lekar dilli ke mandi house aae jahaan par viklang vyaktiyon ke liye ayukta kaa karyaalay he
 Came here because that's why these students have complained that the Railways have not answered their questions
 buudhvaar ko yahaan railway ko apana paksh rakhana tha magar railway kii taraf se koi nahin aayaa
 This group of students gathered outside the commissioner's office
 naare lagane laga
 Started asking for justice
 koi nahin aayaa lekin ye kisi ke bharose nahin, apane iraade ke bharose dilli aae hai
 Listen to where he has come from and how he has come
 maamla yah he ki railway ne jab group di kaa riselt nikaala to viklang shrenee main pradarshan main shaamil chaatr paas ho gaye
 His name was in the result and he was told that all your documents would be checked
 zaahir he paas hone kii khushi kisi ne nahin hogi
 These students started making documents
 lekin kuch din ke baad railway is pariksha main seat badha detii he
 Adds a new category with increased seat
 multiple disebld
 It carries 14 categories of disability
 jabaki farm bharte samay saat shreniyan thim
 Like OL, ie One leg was 95 seats in one leg category
 ahmedabad board main
 There it was reduced to 61
 zyaadaatar chaatro ne ahmedabad board kaa vikalp bharaa tha kyonki vahaan par 95 siten thim
 Obviously, where there will be more seats, there will be more options
 chaatr zyaada farm bhi bharenge
 14 categories of multiple disabilities were added
 jab farm bharte samay 7 hi shreniyan thim to 14 nai shreniyon ke chaatr kahaan se aa gaye
 When the seats were reduced in Ahmedabad board, why were these students not given the option of another board
 yahi nahin pehle jis board main viklangon ke liye koi seat nahin thi, farm bharne ke samay, vahaan riselt nikalne ke baad seat badha gai he or paas hue chaatro ko nae board main bharne kaa vikalp bhi nahin diya
 Suppose Kolkata is a board
 vahaan par kisi viklang ne farm nahin bharaa to riselt ke paas vahaan seat kaise badi, jab kisi ne applai hi nahin kiya to seat kaise badhaai gai or badi hui siton ke liye chaatr kahaan se laae gaye
 Not only this, the Railways sought certificates in a different format from the handicapped which caused a lot of trouble
 supreme court kaa aadesh he ki kisi bhi formet main certificate ho, use maananaa hoga
 These students have another major complaint
 jab riselt niklaa to general se lekar arakshit varg kaa katof niklaa lekin viklangon ke liye katof kyon nahin niklaa
 These students were also frozen at Mandi House in the evening
 inhen insaaf chahie
 Media is needed and opposition is also needed
 kam se kam railway ke kisi adhikari ko inke bich aakar sthiti spasht kerani chahie thi
 Better than dialogue
 hamen bhi dikhaane kaa mauka miltaa ki railway kaa kya paksh he
 The students claim that the Railways did not consider it necessary to present their case in the Commissioner's office for the handicapped
 chaar chaar baar taarikh thi
 While it is the law of the Central Government to have an injustice to the disabled in 2016, if the misconduct in their case is misdemeanor, the officer can face a jail term of 3 years or a fine of Rs 6 lakh
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki ayukta karyaalay kii taraf se or saat dinon kaa samay maanga gaya he
 Students are not ready
 der shaam tak mandi house ke golumber par jamaa rahe
 Keep raising slogans
 chaatro kaa kahana he raat yaheen guzaarenge

 Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal has said that the Congress is unlikely to get a majority on its own in the current Lok Sabha elections, but said with full confidence that the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) is united
 saath hi kaha ki gathbandhan agali sarkaar banane kii sthiti main ho saktaa he
 Speaking to news agency IANS, Sibal said that if the Congress had been convinced of the 272 majority in the Lok Sabha, it would have definitely declared Rahul Gandhi as the prime ministerial candidate, as he is the 'undisputed leader' in the party
 haalanki, jane-maane vakil va purv kendriya mantri sibbal se jab yah sawaal poocha gaya ki agar samprag ko bahumat miltaa he to koun pradhanmantri hoga? is par wo taal-matol karte rahen
 He said that the announcement would be made by the coalition after the results
 jab unase poocha gaya ki congress rahul gandhi ko apana pradhanmantri ummidavaar ghoshit karne se hichak kyon rahi he, tab unhone kaha ki agar congress ko 272 siten milteen to koi hichkichaahat nahin hoti
 Sibal was told that the Congress can still put forward Rahul Gandhi as its prime ministerial candidate and say that if the party gets a majority it will be the Prime Minister
 is par unhone kaha, 'nisandeh agar hamen bahumat miltaa he to isamen koi andeh nahin he, lekin ise kehane kaa koi sawaal nahin he
 We know that we will not get a majority
 ham jaanate hai ki hamen 272 siten nahin hasil hongi, ham yah bhi jaanate hai ki bhaajapa ko bhi 160 se zyada siten nahin milengi
 'when he was told that he was making a big statement, he replied,' Why not, absolutely, we will not get a majority, there is no possibility
 'sibbal se phir se poocha gaya ki kya vah kahana chaahate hai ki congress ko bahumat nahin milegaa? is par unhone kaha, 'hamen apane dam par 272 siten nahin milengi
 It would be foolish of me to say that getting majority and BJP will get less than 160 seats
 'iske saath hi unhone kaha ki congress kii aguwai vaale samprag ko chunaav main badhat hasil hogi or yah sarkaar bana saktaa he
 However, it also has to fight the 'grand Alliance'
 'mahagathbandhan' uttar pradesh main kuch vipakshi partiyon kaa gathbandhan he
 Asked who could be the Prime Minister if the Congress-led UPA wins a majority? Sibal said it would be decided by the alliance
 yah sab 23 may ko parinaamon kii ghoshnaa ke baad hoga
 Asked whether there can be anyone other than Rahul Gandhi is the Prime Minister? He said, 'I don't know, the alliance will decide
 is vishay par gathbandhan ke saajhedaar faisla karenge
 As far as the Congress party is concerned, Rahul Gandhi is the undisputed leader in the Congress
 ' mahagathbandhan kii kshamta ke sandarbh main sawaal karne par sibbal ne kaha ki ise congress ne nahin banaaya he
 Sibal said, 'our alliance is united
 hamaari party ke saath gathbandhan he
 All our alliances date back to 2014 and remain intact, be it NCP or DMK
 hamane do or ko joda he
 It has JDS in Karnataka and CPI-M in West Bengal
 'yah zikr karne par ki samaajawaadee party ne alag hokar bahujan samaaj party ke saath gathbandhan kar liya

 is par sibbal ne kaha, 'yah hamaari galati nahin he, hamaare gathbandhan saajhedaar ekajute hai hamane unamem se kisi ko nahin choda he, balki hamane apane gathbandhan saajhedaaron ko joda he
 'he said,' but (BSP chief) Mayawati consistently opposed it

 In Sohna police station, the victim was seated in the police station till late night

 ) rajya sabha ke saansad or bijepi netaa subramanian swami ne bhartiya reserve bank ke garvanar raghuram rajan ke bare main kaha he ki unhen waapas chicago bhej dena chahie
 Swamy says that the increased interest rates have ruined the industry
 rajan kii aalochana to thik he lekin agar swami ji kii duusari baat thik he ki rajan ke faisle se udyog dhandhe chaupat ho gaye to phir vitt mantri kii baat ko kaise sahi maan len ki bharat kii arthvyavastha kaaphi tezi se bad rahi he
 Now only one of two things can happen
 yaa to udyog dhandhe chaupat ho gaye yaa phir arthvyavastha tezi se bad rahi he
 Politics has also become like an advertisement with DMK and AIDMK
 tippaniyan Raghuram Rajan, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, assumed office on August 6, 2013
 aate hi unhone teen baar repo rate main badhotaree kar di
 After that it is also subtracted five times
 is vakt repo rate 6
 50 percent
 jab unhone offis sambhala tha tab repo rate 7
 Was 50 percent
 yah bahes chalati rahati he ki rajan agar repo rate or kam kar dete to bainkon ke paas karj dene ke liye or adhik paise hote lekin kuch kaa kahana he ki bainkon se karj kaa uthaan bahut kam he
 Banks themselves are going through a period of crisis
 yah ek lambii bahes he isliye vistaar se nahin bataa rahaa
 Recently, Raghuram Rajan called the Indian economy as the Kana king among the blind in the world
 is bayaan kii sarkaar ke kai mantriyon ne aalochana bhi kii
 Rajan later expressed regret
 aap jaanate hai is saal sitambar main rajan kaa kaarykaal khatm ho rahaa he
 Their tenure will increase or someone else will come, it will be a drag
 swami ne november 2015 main centre sarkaar ko kaala dhan waapas laane ke liye chah sujhaavon vaale patr likhe the
 Then Swamy had said that black money can never come back from the path adopted by the Finance Minister
 tab swami ne yah bhi kaha tha ki agar unhen vitt mantri banaaya jaae to chah maheene main mahangaai kam kar sakate hai
 On Wednesday, the Finance Minister praised Subramanian Swamy's understanding in the Rajya Sabha and said that he is a well-known economist
 rajya sabha saansad swami ko kisi protsaahan kii zarurat to nahin magar ho saktaa he ki ve vitt mantri kii tarif se buland hokar rajan ko chicago bhejne kii baat kar baithe hon
 Raghuram Rajan has been a professor at the University of Chicago
 bhartiya reserve bank ke garvanar raghuram rajan ne 6, agast, 2013 ko apana pad sambhala tha
 He increased the repo rate three times as soon as he arrived
 uske baad paanch baar ghataya bhi he
 Repo rate 6 at the moment
 50 pratishat he
 Repo rate 7 when he took office
 50 pratishat thi
 The debate goes on that if Rajan had reduced the repo rate further, banks would have had more money to lend, but some say that there is very little debt from banks
 bank khud sankat ke daur se guzar rahe hai
 This is a long debate so not elaborating
 haal hi main raghuram rajan ne bhartiya arthvyavastha ko duniya main andhon main kaana raja kah diya tha
 This statement was also criticized by many ministers of the government
 baad main rajan ne afsos prakat kiya tha
 You know Rajan's term is coming to an end in September this year
 unka kaarykaal badhegaa yaa koi or aayega, ise lekar khinchataan to chalegi
 In November 2015, Swamy wrote letters to the central government with six suggestions to bring back black money
 tab swami ne kaha tha ki jo rasta vitt mantri ne apanaaya he usase kalaadhan kabhi waapas nahin aa saktaa
 Then Swamy had also said that if he is made the finance minister, he can reduce inflation in six months
 buudhvaar ko vitt mantri ne rajya sabha main subrahamanin swami kii samaj kii tarif karte hue kaha ki ve ek jane maane arthshaastri hai
 Swamy, a Rajya Sabha MP, may not need any encouragement, but he may be talking about sending Rajan to Chicago, exalted by the praise of the Finance Minister
 raghuram rajan uniwarsity of chicago main professor rah chuke hai
