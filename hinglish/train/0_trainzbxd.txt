 isse pehle guuruuvaar ko vidhansabha ke pehle din sadan ke andar vipaksh ke hangaame se zyada sadan ke baahar patrakaron kaa hangaamaa hua
 It is believed that Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is angry with the behavior of Assembly Speaker CP Joshi on the issue of journalists
 baat den ki seepi joshi ne is baar vidhansabha ke kawarej ke liye banane vaale patrkaar paas main baari katautee kar di he
 Journalists are angry with CP Joshi's decision
 vidhansabha adhyaksh seepi joshi ne varisht patrakaron ke ‘paas’ or ek santhaan se 5-5 ‘paas’ banane par roak lagaate hue ek santhaan se ek ‘paas’ kaa niyam bana diya he, jisamen swatantra patrkaar or online patrakaron ke liye koi jagah nahin rakhi gai he
 Now even the cameraman and photographer cannot go inside the assembly
 iske alaava patrakaron ko patrkaar ddeergha ke alaava kahin or jane nahin diya jayega
 It is clearly written on the passes that are being given that journalists will not go outside the Journalist Gallery
 isse pehle vidhansabha kawarej ke liye paas banane ke liye kabhi pareshaani nahin hoti thi
 Old and independent journalists also used to go for coverage
 aise patrkaar bhi jate the jo chote saptaahik or masik patrika nikaalte hai
 Journalists were also allowed to go to the canteen to eat food and drink tea
 iske alaava ‘haa’ paksh or ‘naa’ paksh lobby main ja sakate the
 Ministers' rooms were also allowed to go
 magar vidhansabha adhyaksh seepi joshi ne is sab par roak lagaate hue patrakaron ke paas pehle kii tulana main 80 fisadi kam kar di he
 Not only this, the number of people coming with mlas has also been limited
 ab ek vidhayak or ek adhikari ke saath 2 se zyada log vidhansabha ke andar nahin aa sakate hai
 Journalists have sat on a dharna outside the Speaker's room against this new rule of the Assembly
 vidhansabha ke baahar bhi patrkaar apana virodh jataa rahe hai
 Earlier, during the rule of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), it was prohibited to carry cameras inside the assembly
 pehle vidhansabha ke satr ke pehle din or bajet satr main camera andar le jane kii chhot thi
 But it was banned during the last BJP government

 Meanwhile, his name also figured in the conspiracy of the 2008 blast in Malegaon, Maharashtra
 haalanki samjhauta blast maamle main aaropee aseemanand ko badi raahat mil gai thi
 As Aseemanand's name is associated in many blasts, he has many names

 However, Aseemanand later reversed his statement and said that he had given the previous statement under pressure from the NIA
 leftinent karnal shrikant prasad purohitkarnal purohit kaa sambandh abhinav bharat naamak kattarpanthi sanghathan se bataaya jaataa he
 The priest is said to have created a separate constitution, separate flag for the alleged Hindu nation
 purohit ne sanghathan kii baithkon main shaamil hokar visphotak jutaney ke liye sahmati di or aties ne use maalegaanv blast ke mukhya shadyantrakarta main se ek mana tha
 Colonel Purohit had cited the need to expand the activities of his organization Abhinav Bharat, citing increasing jihadi activities
 blast ke ek gavaah ne kathith taur par aties ko bataaya tha ki karnal purohit ne muslim bahul ilaake main bam visphot ke saath musalamaanon se badla lene ke bare main apni raay jaahir kii thi
 Pragya Singh Thakur then showed readiness to provide people for this work

 upaadhyaay ne jail se jamaanat par chhootane ke baad bataaya tha ki duusari aaropee sadhvi pragna sihan thakur ke saath bhi jail main acha bartaav nahin hota tha
 He was called a Hindu terrorist after his name in Malegaon blast

 The NIA had said that the ATS referred to the important evidence in the record, the motorcycle, in their investigation it was found that she was registered in the name of Sadhvi, but her possession was with Ramchandra Kalsangra
 vah us motorcycle ko do saal se chalaa rahaa tha
 So Sadhvi was not involved with this incident
 haalanki court ne enie ke tark ko khaarij karte hue pragna ko is maamle se bari karne kii apil khaarij kar di thi
 This case is still going on in court

 Before the end of the monsoon session of Parliament on Thursday, Jaitley introduced the Constitution Amendment Bill on GST in the Rajya Sabha incorporating the suggestions of the Nesdnaki Committee
 lekin congress sadasyon ke hangaame ke kaaran is par charchaa nahin shuru ho saki
 Amidst the 'congress on suicidal path', Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien said that this is a constitution amendment bill, so it is necessary for the House to run smoothly for its passage
 iske baad unhone baithak din bhar ke liye sthagit kar di
 Jaitley said, 'unfortunately the Congress is on a suicidal path
 ham isko lekar koi shikaayat nahin kar sakate
 But she wants to disrupt not only the Parliament of India but also obstruct the path of national growth
 'unhone kaha ki baadha utpann karne kii raajnneeti congress or desh donon ke liye khatarnaak he
 He appealed to the major opposition parties to look into the cause and adopt a path of cooperation, especially in the context of the policies which he himself once used to beat

 Congress leader in the state Opposition Pareshbhai Dhanani objected to the simultaneous elections to both the seats and reached the Supreme Court against the decision of the Election Commission
 ab adaalat ne unki yachika manjuur kar lee he, isapar buudhvaar ko sunwaayee honi he
 In fact, Gujarat Congress leader Pareshbhai Dhanani has challenged the Election Commission notification
 bataa den ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or kendriya mantri smriti irani is baar loksabhaa saansad chune gaye hai, aise main unki seat khaali hui he jisapar chunaav hona he
 The petition said that conducting separate elections on both the seats on the same day is unconstitutional and against the spirit of the Constitution
 chunaav ayog kii adhisuchana ke mutabik, amit shah ko loksabhaa chunaav jeetne kaa praaanpatr 23 may to vahiin smriti ko 24 may ko mila tha
 This led to a difference of one day in the election of both, on the basis of which the Commission has considered the two seats of the state separately, but the voting has to be on the same day
 congress kaa tark he ki aisa hone se ab donon siton par bijepi ko jeet mil jaaegi kyonki, vahaan pratham variyata vot nae sire se tay honge
 But if elections were held simultaneously, the Congress would get a seat
 aapako bataa den ki sankhya bal ke hisaab se gujarat main rajyasabha kaa chunaav jeetne ke liye ummidavaar ko 61 vot chahie
 An election on the same ballot will allow a candidate to cast a single vote
 is sthiti main congress ek seat aasaani se nikaal leti kyonki uske paas 71 vidhayak hai
 But according to the Election Commission notification, mlas will vote separately
 aise main unhen do baar vot karne kaa mauka milegaa, is tarah bijepi ke vidhayak jinaki sankhya 100 se zyada he ve do baar vot karke donon ummidavaaron ko jita sakate hai
 Let me tell you that even when the Rajya Sabha elections were held in Gujarat, there was a lot of controversy

 Kim Jong Un, the dictator of North Korea, has been given similar support by Russian President Vladimir Putin
 putin kii nazar main kim jong un na sirf samajhadaar balki manze hue siyasatdan hai
 Putin's statement came at a time when his mind is being debated after President Donald Trump's nuclear button tweet across America
 aise main sawaal ye he ki kya vaaki putin taanashaah kim ke big brother ban gaye hai yaa phir andar kii kahani kuch or he?sankat ke liye kim or trump jimmedaarkorian peninsula main jang ke halaat ke liye zimmedaar koun he

 Let me tell you that Russia had not only voted in favor of international sanctions against North Korea's nuclear program in the United Nations

 But now, in the case of Kim Jong Un, Vladimir Putin seems to be retaliating

 In such a situation, when all the countries are leaving him through the UN, then Kim's meeting with Putin is like meeting Sanjeevani

 57-year-old Saklecha does not teach politics to the youth under the banner of his organization 'yuvaam', but teaches the educated-unemployed tricks to pass competitive examinations especially for bank jobs
 aisa ve 1977 se yani 34 varshon se kar rahe hai or vah bhi muft
 They say, "if someone wants love, someone wants money
" maine pyaar ko praathamikta di isliye muft padhaane kaa faisla kiya
 "53-year-old Poonam Patel, who joined Bank's job in 1979 under the guidance of Saklecha, who is currently Assistant General Manager (AGM) at State Bank of India in Mumbai, says," There is no such example of selfless free guidance
 
 unke maargdarshan se jivan kii disha hi badal gai
 Saklecha started a job at State Bank of India in 1977
 us samay ratlam jaise chote shahar main pratiyogi parikshaon ke liye koi koching nahin thi isliye bank main naukari ke icchhuk yuva sakalechaa se maargdarshan lene aate the
 The father of the clerk father in the railway, Saklecha, began to run out of space in the two-room house of the family
 so, tab 23 varshiya sakalechaa ne sthaneey mahavidhyalay main ek cameraa maanga jahaan ve shaam ko yuvaaon ko koching de saken
 According to the rules, the room could be given to any institution only, so they applied in the name of 'yuvaam' and they got the room
 yahi 'yuvam' aaj deshbhar main ratlam kii pahchaan ban gaya he
 Even today, more than 1,200 youth are preparing for bank exams here, of which more than 400 have come from other places
 sakalechaa ke maargdarshan se jo yuva chune gaye, unase unhone apana kuch samay yuvaaon ko maargdarshan dene main lagane ko kaha
 Some of the youth agreed to it and classes increased
 'yuvam' ke pehle batch main padhakar bank main naukari paane vaale or dilli main punjab neshnal bank main agm purushottam maheshwari kehete hai, ''jab hamen nickshulk maargdarshan ke boote saf lata mili to hamane bhi usamen haath bantaana shuru kiya
 This gave us spiritual satisfaction

 Just before the Lok Sabha elections 2019, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is going to rally in Kolkata on January 19 by uniting opposition parties
 mamata kaa daawa he ki isamen kashmir se kanyakumari tak ke gaiyr- bijepi dalon kii bhagidaari hogi
 On this platform of opposition parties, SP President Akhilesh Yadav, RLD President Chaudhary Ajit Singh and his son Jayant Chaudhary to Sharad Yadav will be seen, but Congress President Rahul Gandhi and his mother Sonia Gandhi will not be included
 haalanki, congress kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye varisht netaa mallikarjun khadge jarur pahunchenge
 Several prominent leaders of the opposition will participate in West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's January 19 Maharalee in Kolkata
 haalanki is raily main vampanthi dal shaamil nahin honge
 Apart from this, there is doubt whether Bahujan Samaj Party President Mayawati will attend this rally or not
 jabaki rashtriya janata dal ke adhyaksh sharad yadav is raily main hissaa lenge
 Mamta Banerjee sent an invitation to non-bjp parties to attend this rally
 isi kadi main mamata banerjee ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko bhi aamantran bheja tha taaki vipakshi ekta kii takat or bhi majbootee ke saath dikhaai de
 The Congress high command has declined the invitation for a month and has decided to send senior leader Mallikarjun Kharge in its place
 darasal, pashchim bengal congress cameti mamata kii raily main rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi ke shaamil hone ko lekar sahamat nahin he
 It is being told that the Congress Committee of the state is ready to contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections alone and it is he who suggested Rahul Gandhi not to attend the rally, after which he decided not to attend
 basapa pramukh mayawati ke saath-saath telugana ke mukhyamantri ke chandrashekhar raav ke raily main shaamil hone ko lekar tasviir saaf nahin he
 It is believed that KCR can stay away from this rally due to the Congress leader joining this rally

 info@shukrawar
 net is like a good event
 is ank ke sampadak vishnu nagar, ashok kumaar or unke sahyogiyon ne rachanaaon ke chayan main loktantric najariya apanaaya he
 The good thing is that Hindi ideological and other types of factionalism have been avoided in editing and selection
 nae jamaane main pathakon ke loktantr ko mahatv mila he
 This is the reason why many well-known writers, along with new and relatively lesser-known creators, have also been given space
 kareeb 200 pannon main 100 se bhi zyada lekhakon kii rachanaaen shaamil hai
 But the most important part of this annuity is its cover story: 'writing in writing'
 is bahes main ek taraf namvar singh sareekhe diggaj aalochak hai to duusari taraf nirmala putul, anuj lugun or anita bharti sareekhe adivasee or dalit samaaj se aane vaale yuva lekhak
 Namvar Singh may have said with eyes that "then it will be Brahmin literature, Kshatriya literature, Savarna and Avarna literature", but most authors are demanding an in-depth analysis of the subject
 virendra yadav kehete hai ki “saamaajik bhedbhaav ke prati hindi ke kuleen lekhakon kii pakhandpurn chuppi se hi daliton main avishvaas paidaa hua
 It is from here that a simplified recipe like 'dalit can write Dalit' is born
 ” acha hota ki sahitya main aarakshan kii purajor vakaalat karne vaale rajendra yadav ke vichaaron se bhi muthbhed hoti
 This issue will also be known for the unpublished poems of renowned poet Muktibodh and painter Jagdish Swaminathan
 kam hi logon ko pataa he ki swaminathan yuvavastha main hindi ke patrkaar / lekhak rah chuke hai
 An inclusive approach also appears in the selection of the poetry section
 varisht kavi kedarnath singh to hai hi, sudhaa upaadhyaay or anju sharma tak darjanon aise kavi bhi shaamil hai, jo amuman aisi sahitya varshikiyon main jagah paane se vanchit rah jate rahe hai
 Here all the authors of the previous annuity have been avoided from repeating
 sampadakeey main vishnu nagar likhte bhi hai ki isse “pathakon main yah sandesh jaataa ki hindi main kul samarth lekhak itane hi hai
 "it is interesting that in the decoration of the annuity, children's paintings have been preferred over the famous painters
 bhopal kii eklavya sanstha ke sahyog se yah sambhav hua he
 This shows how many forms of art can occur in the world of children
 har varshiki kii tarah isamen bhi kai kahaniyaan hai par hridayesh, mridula garg, sanjeev, avadhesh preet aadi kii kahaniyaan mahatvapurn hai
 An important part of the annuity is the memoir section
 isamen kai vilakshan sansmaran hamaara dhyaan khinchate hai
 Senior writer Mannu Bhandari has written unforgettable memoirs on his parents, despite his growing age and ill-health
 duusari ore gyaan ranjan ko unki patni sunaina kii najaron se padhgaye kii koshish kii gai he
 Ajit Kumar has remembered the childhood days of Amitabh Bachchan afresh, then Dr
 ramvilas sharma ke putr vijay mohan sharma ne apane pita ke saath apane paitruk gaanv kii yatra kii yaaden saz kii hai
 a surprising memoir is that of Hans editor and senior narrator Rajendra Yadav, in which he describes Sachchidananda Hiranand Vatsyayan Agnay as his ideal
 haalanki ham sabko pataa he ki unke ekmaatr adarsh french lekhak jyaan paul sartra hai
 On the one hand in the novel excerpt, reading the novel excerpt of Gyan Chaturvedi along with the excerpt from the upcoming novel of the late Kamatanath is no less interesting
 hamaare samay main loktantric chayan or sampadan kii lakh koshishon ke baavjood bahut saare aise swar jagah paane se vanchit rah jate hai
 This is also the limit of every selection and the possibility of editorial vision
 isaki saajasja, dizin stareey he
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has termed the alliance of SP and BSP as a 'compulsion deal'
 unhone kaha sapa-basapa kaa ek saath aana bhartiya janata party ke liye koi chalange nahin he, balki ab jab donon saath aa gaye hai to inhen niptaana or aasaan ho gaya he
 Yogi Adityanath said that SP was more compelled to combine than BSP
 kyonki agar ye gathbandhan nahin karte to akhilesh kannauj kii seat bhi nahin bachaa pate, itawa or mainpuri kii seat to dur kii baat he
 Yogi said, 'mayawati has pleased SP, gave more seats than required
 mayawati sapa ko 10 siten bhi deteen to akhilesh naak ragadkar le lete
 Because the sp's position in the state is very bad
 '
 
 
 Now both have to be settled and Sahayogi claimed that SP is not in a position to challenge more than 10 seats in Uttar Pradesh
 kannauj kii seat bachaane ke liye akhilesh ne gathbandhan kiya he
 If Yogi is to be believed, this alliance will not affect the election and now it is easier to deal with both of them
 kumbh par india today (india Today Round Table on The Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj) ke kaarykram main yogi ne kaha, 'sapa or basapa ne jis prakaar raajnneeti kii he wo janata jaanati he
 From 1993 to 1995, both of them ran the government together
 uske baad bhi donon ne alag-alag purna bahumat vaali sarkaar di
 He only did caste politics in the state
 'sapa par yogi kaa praharasapa par prahaar karte hue yogi ne kaha, 'inaki sarkaar main bhrashtachariyon or gundon kaa bolbalaa tha
 There was an atmosphere of seclusion all around
 lut-khasot, dange karwaae jate the
 He did politics of only a particular section, but did not do a thing in his interest
 'unhone kaha ki akhilesh ne yah gathbandhan kar sabase pehle mulaayam singh yadav ko or peeche dhakel diya he
 In the last Lok Sabha election, Akhilesh had ahead of Mulayam Singh Yadav as the prime ministerial candidate, will this time forward Mayawati? These parties should tell who is their PM candidate? The public will not accept a leaderless alliance
 is gathbandhan ke paksh main mulaayam nahin the
 Now that the alliance is already done, it remains to be seen whether they give tickets to Mulayam or not, although Shivpal has already said that we will give tickets to Netaji

 ' aaj se bharat or south africa ke bich test series shuru ho chuki he
 Virat Kohli is the new captain of Team India of the Test
 agar team kaa pradarshan thoda kamazor hoga to viraat kii captaini kii tulana mahendra singh dhoni se hogi
 In the glory of Dhoni, the ballads will be read, but i want to say that at the right time, Dhoni decided to retire from the Test team at least because Dhoni is no longer arrogant
 main jaanata hum ki mere is lekh ko padhakar kuch log mere saath sahamat nahin honge magar yah keval main nahin kah rahaa hum
 Dhoni's statistics are saying that Dhoni is no longer arrogant
 mujhe yakeen he ki jab aap ye artical padhenge to aap bhi shaayad kahenge ki 'wo zamana gaya jab khalil khan faakhtaa udaaya karte the
 ' ek zamana tha jab dhoni ko duniya kaa sabase acha finishr kaha jaataa tha
 Dhoni used to send any ball of any bowler of the world across the boundary line whenever he wanted
 duniya ke behtareen gendbaaj dhoni se khof khate the
 The last overs were considered the most dangerous batsmen in the world and they had the power to fight back and win the match
 yahi vajah he ki dhoni ko dhurandhar kaha jaataa tha magar wo guzare jamaane kii baat ho chuki he
 After winning the 2011 World Cup, there has been a steady decline in Dhoni's competition
 chaahe dhoni kaa strike rate ho yaa concystancy, har chiz main giravat aayi he
 First of all, take a look at the decline in the performance of the IPL played in the country and decide whether Dhoni's bluntness has reduced
 Dhoni's strike rate was 166 in 2013 in the sixth IPL
 or 2014 yani 7wein IPL main dhoni kaa strike rate 148 par pahunch gaya
 In the 8th IPL in 2015, Dhoni's strike rate fell further and the strike rate fell to around 122
 122 kaa strike rate aaj kii cricket yaa tii20 main saadhaaran mana jaataa he or is hisaab se dhoni kaa strike rate ekadam saadhaaran ho gaya
 Not far behind, take the 2014 World Cup final of T20
 yuvaraj singh ke ghar patharav hue kyonki aakiri ke overon main yuvaraj nahin dhulaai kar paae
 From the point of view of Sri Lankan bowlers, Dhoni is also guilty because in the last 5 overs with Yuvraj, Dhoni was also present at the crease and Dhoni also scored 25 runs in the same 25 balls i
e
 Dhoni could not beat the Sri Lankan bowlers
 Were
 dakshin africa ke viruddh chal rahi siries par agar roshni daalen to tii20 ho yaa vanade siries, dhoni kii team ko paraajay kaa saamana karnaa padaa wo bhi apni dharti par jahaan sabakuch apane hisaab se hota he
 But in this article, i am not talking about India's defeat but about Dhoni's failure
 is siries main team india to haari hi magar dhoni kii zyaada pole khuli or aisa mahasoos hone laga ki dhoni bechaare or laachaar ban gaye
 In the first ODI in front of South African bowlers, he scored only 31 runs in 30 balls and put Team India in a position where the team lost
 dhoni ne is haar kii zimmedaari bhi baad main lee
 In the second ODI, Dhoni scored 92 runs but faced 86 balls for him and in the last overs, it is a simple batting for a dangerous batsman like Dhoni
 is vanade ke liye ye kaha ja saktaa he ki wicket bachaane ke liye dhoni ne thodi dhimi gati se ballebaazi kii magar meraa ye maananaa he ki dhoni kii laachaari yahaan saafe dikhi, jab aakhri ke over main dhoni ne 5 gendon par koi ran nahin banaaya
 Wanted to hit on every ball but was failing
 sirf aakhri ball par mushkil se chakka laga
 If Dhoni plays 5 dot ball then his bat is really tired
 tisare ekadivasiy antarrashtriya mukaable main team india jeetne kii raah par thi magar is mukaable main bhi dhoni haar ke zyaada zimmedaar bane kyonki dhoni ne 47 ran banane ke liye 61 ball kaa saamana kiya, vah bhi khel ke bich main jab dhimi gati ke gendbaaz or spinner gendbaazi kar rahe the
 When it came time to score fast runs, Dhoni was out and the run rate needed to win was so great that Team India could not get out of that mind
 tippaniyan In the fourth ODI of this series against South Africa, Dhoni's bat looked old and tired
 aakiri ke overon main dhoni kries par maujuud the
 The wicket was also left, but Dhoni, considered the most dangerous in the last overs, was craving to get the ball across the boundary line
 dakshin africa ke gendbaaj rabada joki abhi-abhi antarrashtriya cricket main aae hai, 47waan over karne aaye or dhoni ko wicket par maujuud hone ke baavjood 3 se 4 ran bane
 Dale Steyn bowled the 48th over and Dhoni scored barely one run and scored 5 runs in one over
 49waan over phir se rabada lekar aaye or is over main bhi keval 5 ran bane
 50th is the last over brought by Dale Steyn
 ab bhi dhoni kries par maujuud the magar kuch nahin kar paye or 16 gendon main 15 ran banaakar out ho gaye
 You will also remember the bad defeat in the 5th and last match, when Dhoni scored 27 runs
 in aakadon or lagaataar girte pradarshan ke baad yah kahana, mere najariye se galat nahin hoga, ki dhoni ab dhurandhar nahin rahe
 i know that some people will not agree with me after reading this article but i am not saying this only
 dhoni ke aankade kah rahe hai ki dhoni ab dhurandhar nahin rahe
 i am sure that when you read this article, you too will probably say that it was a time when Khaleel Khan used to throw a gun
 ' There was a time when Dhoni was called the best finisher in the world
 duniya ke kisi bhi gendbaaj kii kisi bhi gend ko seemaa rekha ke paar jab chaahate the, dhoni bhej dete the
 The finest bowlers in the world were in awe of Dhoni
 aakhri ke overon main duniya ke sabase khatarnaak ballebaaz maane jate the or unamem gazab kii ladakar match jeetne kii shakti thi
 This is the reason why Dhoni was called arrogant but it has been a thing of the past
 saal 2011 ke world cap ko jeetne ke baad dhoni ke prarshan main lagaataar giravat aayi he
 Whether Dhoni's strike rate or consistency, everything has come down
 sabase pehle desh main hi khele janevaale IPL ke pradarshan main aayi giravat par ek nazar daal lijiye or faisla kijiye ki kya dhoni kaa dhurandhar pen kam hua he? dhoni kaa strike rate chathe IPL yani 2013 main 166 kaa tha
 And Dhoni's strike rate reached 148 in 2014 i
e
 7th IPL
 2015 main hue 8wein IPL main dhoni ke strike rate main or baari giravat ai or ye strike rate gir kar pahunch gaya kareeb 122 par
 Strike rate of 122 is considered normal in today's cricket or T20 and according to this Dhoni's strike rate became very simple
 zyaada peeche nahin, 2014 ke tii20 kaa world cap final hi le lijiye
 Yuvraj Singh's house was stoned because Yuvraj was not able to wash in the last over
 srilanka ke gendbaajon kii najar se dekha jaae to dhoni bhi doshi hai kyonki yuvaraj ke saath aakhri ke 5 overon main kries par dhoni bhi maujuud the or dhoni ne bhi kareeb vahi 25 gendon main 25 ran banaaye the yani dhoni srilankan gendbaajon kii dhunaai nahin kar paye the
 If we throw light on the series against South Africa, be it T20 or ODI series, Dhoni's team had to face defeat even on their own earth where everything happens according to their own
 magar is artical main main bharat kii haar ke bare main nahin balki dhoni kii naakaami ke bare main bataa rahaa hum
 Team India lost in this series but Dhoni got more open and felt that Dhoni became poor and helpless
 south african gendbaazon ke saamne pehle vanade main 30 ball main keval 31 ran banaaya or team india ko aisi sthiti main khadaa kar diya jahaan haar gai team
 Dhoni also claimed responsibility for this defeat later
 duusare ek divasiy mukaable main dhoni ne 92 ran to banaaye magar uske liye 86 gendon kaa saamana kiya or aakhri ke overon main dhoni jaise khataranaak ballebaaz ke liye ye saadhaaran ballebaazi he
 For this ODI, it can be said that Dhoni batted a little slower to save the wicket but i believe that Dhoni's helplessness was seen here, when in the last over, Dhoni did not score any runs from 5 balls
 har gend par maarna chaah rahe the magar naakaam ho rahe the
 Hardly six on the last ball
 5 dot ball agar dhoni khele to vaaki uskaa balla thak gaya he
 Team India was on track to win in the third ODI, but in this match also Dhoni became more responsible for the defeat as Dhoni faced 61 balls to score 47 runs, that too in the middle of the game when slow bowlers and spinners
 Were bowling
 jab tej ran banane kaa samay aayaa tab dhoni out ho gaye or jeet ke liye zaruri ran rate ko itnaa bada kar gaye ki team india us manjhdhaar se nikal hi nahin pai
 The comments dakshin africa ke viruddh is siries ke chauthe vanade main dhoni kaa balla or boodha or thakaa hua nazar aayaa
 Dhoni was present at the crease in the last over
 wicket bhi bachi hui thi magar aakhri ke overon main sabase khatarnaak mana jane vaala dhurandhar dhoni seemaa rekha ke paar gend pahunchane ke liye taras rahaa tha
 South African bowler Rabada, who has just come into international cricket, came to the 47th over and Dhoni scored 3 to 4 despite being present on the wicket
 del sten ne 48waan over phenkaa or dhoni ne mushkil se ek ek ran kar mushkil se ek over main 5 ran banaaye
 The 49th over came again with Rabada and in this over only 5 runs were scored
 50waan yani aakiri over del sten lekar aaye
 Dhoni was still at the crease but could not do anything and was dismissed for 15 runs in 16 balls
 5waan or aakiri mukaable main buree tarah haar bhi aapako yaad hogi, jab dhoni ne 27 ran banaaye the
 After these figures and the continuously falling performance, it would not be wrong from my point of view that Dhoni is no longer a prankster
 ek zamana tha jab dhoni ko duniya kaa sabase acha finishr kaha jaataa tha
 Dhoni used to send any ball of any bowler of the world across the boundary line whenever he wanted
 duniya ke behtareen gendbaaj dhoni se khof khate the
 The last overs were considered the most dangerous batsmen in the world and they had the power to fight back and win the match
 yahi vajah he ki dhoni ko dhurandhar kaha jaataa tha magar wo guzare jamaane kii baat ho chuki he

 in aakadon or lagaataar girte pradarshan ke baad yah kahana, mere najariye se galat nahin hoga, ki dhoni ab dhurandhar nahin rahe
 Not far behind, take the 2014 World Cup final of T20
 yuvaraj singh ke ghar patharav hue kyonki aakiri ke overon main yuvaraj nahin dhulaai kar paae
 From the point of view of Sri Lankan bowlers, Dhoni is also guilty because in the last 5 overs with Yuvraj, Dhoni was also present at the crease and Dhoni also scored 25 runs in the same 25 balls i
e
 Dhoni could not beat the Sri Lankan bowlers
 Were
 dakshin africa ke viruddh chal rahi siries par agar roshni daalen to tii20 ho yaa vanade siries, dhoni kii team ko paraajay kaa saamana karnaa padaa wo bhi apni dharti par jahaan sabakuch apane hisaab se hota he
 But in this article, i am not talking about India's defeat but about Dhoni's failure
 is siries main team india to haari hi magar dhoni kii zyaada pole khuli or aisa mahasoos hone laga ki dhoni bechaare or laachaar ban gaye
 In the first ODI in front of South African bowlers, he scored only 31 runs in 30 balls and put Team India in a position where the team lost
 dhoni ne is haar kii zimmedaari bhi baad main lee
 In the second ODI, Dhoni scored 92 runs but faced 86 balls for him and in the last overs, it is a simple batting for a dangerous batsman like Dhoni
 is vanade ke liye ye kaha ja saktaa he ki wicket bachaane ke liye dhoni ne thodi dhimi gati se ballebaazi kii magar meraa ye maananaa he ki dhoni kii laachaari yahaan saafe dikhi, jab aakhri ke over main dhoni ne 5 gendon par koi ran nahin banaaya
 Wanted to hit on every ball but was failing
 sirf aakhri ball par mushkil se chakka laga
 If Dhoni plays 5 dot ball then his bat is really tired
 tisare ekadivasiy antarrashtriya mukaable main team india jeetne kii raah par thi magar is mukaable main bhi dhoni haar ke zyaada zimmedaar bane kyonki dhoni ne 47 ran banane ke liye 61 ball kaa saamana kiya, vah bhi khel ke bich main jab dhimi gati ke gendbaaz or spinner gendbaazi kar rahe the
 When it came time to score fast runs, Dhoni was out and the run rate needed to win was so great that Team India could not get out of that mind
 tippaniyan In the fourth ODI of this series against South Africa, Dhoni's bat looked old and tired
 aakiri ke overon main dhoni kries par maujuud the
 The wicket was also left, but Dhoni, considered the most dangerous in the last overs, was craving to get the ball across the boundary line
 dakshin africa ke gendbaaj rabada joki abhi-abhi antarrashtriya cricket main aae hai, 47waan over karne aaye or dhoni ko wicket par maujuud hone ke baavjood 3 se 4 ran bane
 Dale Steyn bowled the 48th over and Dhoni scored barely one run and scored 5 runs in one over
 49waan over phir se rabada lekar aaye or is over main bhi keval 5 ran bane
 50th is the last over brought by Dale Steyn
 ab bhi dhoni kries par maujuud the magar kuch nahin kar paye or 16 gendon main 15 ran banaakar out ho gaye
 You will also remember the bad defeat in the 5th and last match, when Dhoni scored 27 runs
 in aakadon or lagaataar girte pradarshan ke baad yah kahana, mere najariye se galat nahin hoga, ki dhoni ab dhurandhar nahin rahe
 If we throw light on the series against South Africa, be it T20 or ODI series, Dhoni's team had to face defeat even on their own earth where everything happens according to their own
 magar is artical main main bharat kii haar ke bare main nahin balki dhoni kii naakaami ke bare main bataa rahaa hum
 Team India lost in this series but Dhoni got more open and felt that Dhoni became poor and helpless
 south african gendbaazon ke saamne pehle vanade main 30 ball main keval 31 ran banaaya or team india ko aisi sthiti main khadaa kar diya jahaan haar gai team
 Dhoni also claimed responsibility for this defeat later
 duusare ek divasiy mukaable main dhoni ne 92 ran to banaaye magar uske liye 86 gendon kaa saamana kiya or aakhri ke overon main dhoni jaise khataranaak ballebaaz ke liye ye saadhaaran ballebaazi he
 For this ODI, it can be said that Dhoni batted a little slower to save the wicket but i believe that Dhoni's helplessness was seen here, when in the last over, Dhoni did not score any runs from 5 balls
 har gend par maarna chaah rahe the magar naakaam ho rahe the
 Hardly six on the last ball
 5 dot ball agar dhoni khele to vaaki uskaa balla thak gaya he
 Team India was on track to win in the third ODI, but in this match also Dhoni became more responsible for the defeat as Dhoni faced 61 balls to score 47 runs, that too in the middle of the game when slow bowlers and spinners
 Were bowling
 jab tej ran banane kaa samay aayaa tab dhoni out ho gaye or jeet ke liye zaruri ran rate ko itnaa bada kar gaye ki team india us manjhdhaar se nikal hi nahin pai
 The comments dakshin africa ke viruddh is siries ke chauthe vanade main dhoni kaa balla or boodha or thakaa hua nazar aayaa
 Dhoni was present at the crease in the last over
 wicket bhi bachi hui thi magar aakhri ke overon main sabase khatarnaak mana jane vaala dhurandhar dhoni seemaa rekha ke paar gend pahunchane ke liye taras rahaa tha
 South African bowler Rabada, who has just come into international cricket, came to the 47th over and Dhoni scored 3 to 4 despite being present on the wicket
 del sten ne 48waan over phenkaa or dhoni ne mushkil se ek ek ran kar mushkil se ek over main 5 ran banaaye
 The 49th over came again with Rabada and in this over only 5 runs were scored
 50waan yani aakiri over del sten lekar aaye
 Dhoni was still at the crease but could not do anything and was dismissed for 15 runs in 16 balls
 5waan or aakiri mukaable main buree tarah haar bhi aapako yaad hogi, jab dhoni ne 27 ran banaaye the
 After these figures and the continuously falling performance, it would not be wrong from my point of view that Dhoni is no longer a prankster

 Agenda Aaj Tak youth leaders reached the session Union Minister RPN Singh, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha President and MP Anurag Thakur, Biju Janata Dal MP Jai Panda and Lalu Prasad Yadav's son Tejashwi Yadav
 yuva raajnneeti or desh ke netritv par baat karte hue anuraag bole ki youth 60 saal ke modi main apana netaa dekhtaa he kyonki vah sahi samay par sahi mudde uthaate hai or unki aawaaj ko aage rakhte hai
 RPN Singh said that Rahul Gandhi does not become a part of TV debates and social media, but he is communicating with people and youth by roaming in the village and countryside
 jai pandas ne kaha ki jo yuva netaa saansad ban jate hai, unki bhi aawaaj sansad main thik se nahin suni jaati
 Tejashwi Yadav, like his father, said that he would neither take any position in the party nor contest elections
 chaaron netaaon se poocha gaya pehla sawaal ki aap raajnneeti main khandaan kii vajah se aae yaa khud kii marji se
 See what their answers are
 
 
 tejasvi:mere maa-baap siem rah chuke hai
 There was a political atmosphere in the house from the beginning
 sanskaar main tha ki koi bhi ghar aae to use khaali haath nahin lautaanaa
 So the politics was in the blood
 rahi baat meri raajnneeti kii to main desh ke 50 fisadi voter yani yuvaaon kii raajnneeti karnaa chahta hum
 Jai Panda: i am not from any political family
 main shaamil hua, kyonki mujhe system se gussa aata he
 It is not that those who come from political families do not have talent
 magar hamaare system main jab tak level plaing field na ho, koi aam aadmi bina conection or network ke isamen aa saktaa ho, tab tak is tarah kaa badlaav na aae
 Democracy will be lacking
 anuraag thakur:yuva boundry line ke baahar baithkar desh nahin badal sakate
 Young India is becoming a domineering India
 sahi disha kii jarurat he
 If you give the right direction then you will be staring
 varna afat banenge
 This was my thinking, so i came into politics
 mujhe logon kaa aashirwad mila
 i think good people choose a bad government when they do not vote
 arpyen singh:jab mere pita ji the, unhone kabhi nahin chaha ki main isamen aauun
 When he was, i never wore a kurta pajama or climbed on the stage
 main 23 saal kaa tha, jab unka dehanth hua
 i wanted to work at the World Bank in America
 hamaara yahaan 18 acre kaa lichi kaa bagichaa tha
 So father wanted me to take care of him when i come to India
 bachapan main main actor bananaa chahta tha
 But now see, i am in front of you
 16 disambar se baichaiyn the sonia-rahul: arpiendilli gangrape ke dauraan kahaan the rahul gandhi, is sawaal par arpyen singh ne safai di ki rahul, sonia is mudde par chintit the or lagaataar baithak kar rahe the
 During that time, the children outside the house of Sonia ji, who were protesting the youth, were called by Sonia ji the next morning
 baat kii
 The sound he made
 use hamane bill main rakhaa
 Even after the law is increasing, at the anger of the youth atrocities on women, Anurag Thakur said that strict laws are being made to protect women
 magar phir bhi maamle bad rahe hai
 He said that the need has changed
 naitik mulyon kii giravat rokane kii he
 For this one has to go to schools and colleges
 chunaav nahin laduunga, pad bhi nahin luungaa: tejaswikya bade parivaar ke yuva hi aa sakate hai raajnneeti main, is sawaal par jai pandas bole ki aisa ek baar ho saktaa he, magar uske baad to aapako parform karnaa hi hoga
 He said that young mps in Parliament get less opportunities for debate
 aap aankade dekh sakate hai
 They also do not get a chance due to the party whip to have an independent opinion on the issues
 apane parivaar or party kaa paksh rakhte hue tejasvi bole ki na to mere paas koi pad he or na hi chunaav ladane kii ichha he
 i just want to connect the youth with politics
 congress main yuva aa rahe aage: arpienmaujuuda halaat par arpyen singh bole ki congress samet sabhi raajnneetik dalon main ek badlaav kaa daur chal rahaa he
 He said that Congress is bringing youth forward in every state
 rajasthan main jitendra singh or sachin payalat
 Jyotiraditya Scindia in Madhya Pradesh, Ajay Maken and Sandeep Dixit in Delhi
 rahul gandhi kii ahm muddon par chai chuppi par chutki lete hue anuraag thakur ne kaha ki rahul kaise karenge modi kaa muqabla
 Modi ji puts forth his views on every issue and the whole country discusses it
 udhar rahul gandhi hai ki lagaataar bas chuppi hi saadhe rahete hai
 The current government does not talk to the youth: On the pandice issue, Jai Panda said that even though Rahul Gandhi continues to deny the post, the truth is that he has a lot of power
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar gathbandhan ke chalate shithilataa kaa tark detii he
 But the situation was the same ten or twelve years ago, then how did governments perform
 pandas ne kaha ki maujuuda sarkaar kaa mukhiya aisa he ki yuvaaon se communikeshnt sthapit hi nahin hota
 Panda said that the issue is not just about Modi vs Rahul
 puure desh main badlaav aa rahaa he or ab niti ke mudde par netaaon ko sabko or khaastaur par yuvaaon ko bataanaa hoga
 Rahul does not come on TV, go to villages: RPNRPN Singh said that Rahul Gandhi does not come and communicate on TV
 lekin vah gaanv-dehaat main jaakar, paidal chalakar logon se baat karte hai
 Singh said that what is not on social media and TV, is it not connected to the public
 anuraag thakur is par bole ki agar rahul gandhi itnaa hi communicket kar rahe hai to daagi netaaon ke bill par meeting main kyon nahin bole or baad main press conference main bill faadte rahe
 Tejashwi said that Rahul Gandhi and Namo Namo will continue till 2014
 magar yuva ko rigen, religen or cast se baahar aakar stand lenaa hoga
 Then, taking a stand like his father Lalu, he said that secular forces will have to unite against communalism, because communal parties riot and influence the youth
 modi kii youth apil par anuraag thakur bole ki narendra modi sahi samay par bolte hai
 Rahul does not speak against them
 to fark saath yaa chalis kaa nahin, vichaar kaa he

 Let us introduce you to the ten memorable indo-pak matches
 paanch sabaseyaadgartest match1

 vah match dilli ke firozshah kotla main tha
 India scored 372 runs in the first innings thanks to the half-centuries of Vijay Hazar, Hemu Adhikari and Ghulam Ahmed and Pakistan could not match India's score in both innings

 3
 India had 271 runs in the second innings to win the 1999 Chennai Test and Sachin's most combative innings
 82 par 5 wicket gir chuke the, lekin sachin hathiyaar daalane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Sachin took the front and Nayan Mongia supported him from the other end
 sachin peeth dard se lagaataar karaah rahe the, lekin unhone apane bat ko thamane nahin diya
 It was the most combative innings of Sachin's Test career, but when Team India was just 17 runs away from victory, Sachin's memorable innings of 136 runs came to an end
 chaar ran ke andar bharat ke baaki teen wicket bhi gir gaye or sachin kii us sabase yaadgaar pari par pani phir gaya
 Sachin still regrets the defeat of Chennai Test
 4
 1999 was the Kolkata Test Asian Test Championship match
 javagal shrinath ne apni ghaatak gendbaaji se pehali pari main paak team ko 185 par niptaya, lekin rahul dravid or sachin tendulkar jaise manje hue ballebaajon ko shoeb akhtar ne apni speed or swing se din main taare dikhaa die

 sachin ne 194 ranon kii naabad pari se pakistan ke jaale par namak chhidaka or bharat ne 675 kaa pahaad jaisaa score bana liya
 Pakistan scored 407 runs in the first innings, but due to Kumble's killer bowling in the second innings, the hosts settled at 216 and India won by a Test innings and 52 runs
 paanch sabase yaadgaar vanade1
 1986, Miandad's six off the last ball of Chetan Sharma in Sharjah, it was the most memorable ODI not only of india-pakistan but in the history of cricket
 pakistan ko aakhri gend par jeet ke liye chaar ranon kii jarurat thi or javed miyandad ne chetan sharma kii gend par chakka jadkar apni team ko romaanchak jeet dilaai thi
 Chetan Sharma still has not forgotten the tee of that ball
 2
 In 1987, India became the winner in a tie match, in Hyderabad, India batted first and scored 212 runs and the Pakistani team also could not progress beyond 212
 match taai ho gaya
 But India reached this score by losing 6 wickets, while Pakistan lost seven wickets in reaching 212
 isliye is match main bhartiya team ko vijeta ghoshit kiya gaya tha

 India achieved the target with 4 overs remaining and after beating that match, the career of Waqar Younis was destroyed
 5

 pakistan kii panaah main pal rahe aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ko lekar pakistani sena or sarkaar kaise jhooth bolti he, is baat kaa khulaasa ajtak kii esaiti ne kar diya he
 Actually, Jaish is a Bain terrorist organization
 magar isi jaish kaa pakistan se apana akhbaar nikalataa he or baqayada usee akhbaar main jaish ko chanda dene ke liye ishtehaar bhi chhapata he
 And this fund goes to the account of Pakistani bank
 ajtak kii investigeshan team ne bhi jaish ko chanda dene ke naam par phone ghuma diya
 What is color change? ye samajhnaa ho to pehle pakistan ko samajhie
 After the Indian Air Force strike in Balakot, Jaish's mastermind Masood Azhar is in Pakistan
 pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne khud bayaan dete hue kaha ki masood pakistan main he
 It is learned that she is very ill
 chal phir bhi nahin saktaa
 And then looking at international pressure, it turned 180 degrees on its own axis in just one week
 labboluab ye ki aatankiyon ko bachaane ke liye pakistan kisi bhi had tak ja saktaa he
 But Aaj Tak has done a thorough investigation to remove the curtain from every lie of Pakistan
 hamaari special investegating team ne naa sirf jaish ko mil rahi pakistani army kii shah kaa khulaasa karne ja rahi he
 We have also added a link to the foreign funding he is getting
 peshawar se chhapane vaala ek saptahik urdu akhbaar he al-kalam
 Which is considered to be the mouthpiece of Jaish kingpin Masood Azhar
 or isi ke zarie aatanki sanghathan jaish apane napak iraadon ko puraa karne ke liye aarthik madad ikattha karata he
 This weekly newspaper of Jaish is also available online
 jisamen zyaadaatar bharat or jammu-kashmir se judi khabaren rahati hai
 Terrorists are praised as Mujahideen
 peshawar se chhapane vaala ye akhbaar darasal, ek aadmi kii zimmedaari he
 Which is named Talha Saif
 masood ajahar kaa behad kareebi or jaish ke propeganda wing kaa chif
 This is the same Talha which India has mentioned in the dossier handed over to Pakistan in case of Pulwama attack
 jab hamane jaish ke is akhbaar ke pichley editons ko khangala
 Then this old commercial of Jaish passed through our eyes

 raibareli sadar seat se 5 baar ke bahubali vidhayak akhilesh pratap singh kii beti aditi singh ne 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki, wo priyanka se prabhavit hokar raajnneeti main ai hai
 His father is not contesting this time due to illness and instead Aditi Singh is contesting from the Sadar seat of Rae Bareli on a Congress ticket
 gauratlab he ki akhilesh singh kii chhavi ilaake main robin hud kii rahi he
 His background has been criminal
 shuru main wo congress ke tikat par hi vidhayak bane the, lekin baad main unki chhavi or sthaneey netaaon se anban ne unhen congress se dur kar diya
 But the Sadar seat of Sonia Gandhi's parliamentary constituency, he continued to contest and win elections, sometimes staying independent, sometimes within the bars of jail
 aakhri baar saal 2012 main wo pis party ke tikat par chunaav jite
 Akhilesh Singh's strength was only when Sonia resigned from Rae Bareli seat in the Lok Sabha in the matter of office of profit and the Gandhi family sought Akhilesh's help in seeking to increase the margin of victory in the by-election
 akhilesh ne nirdaleey rahakar madad kii bhi or sonia kii jeet kaa antar bhi badha diya
 But his image, temperament, domination and disunity with local Congress leaders have once again put him in the opposition of the Gandhi family
 karaab sehat ke chalate akhilesh ko apni viraasat kii chintaa sataane lagi
 Seeing the light in the area too, Akhilesh once again turned to Congress
 haalanki wo khud parade ke peeche rahe
 Akhilesh's image may be overbearing, but he has given a completely different atmosphere to his daughter
 aditi singh america se master degree lekar pita kii viraasat sanbhaalane raibareli aayin hai
 She also answers the question of her father's Bahubali and criminal image
 aditi kahati hai ki meraa or mere pita kaa vyaktitv alag he
 There may be differences between us on many issues, but you can also see that my father has raised his father five times in a row, so i also learn a lot from my father and want to be as strong as him
 kabhi gandhi parivaar par nijee hamale karne vaale akhilesh singh kii bete congress main kaise aa gai, is sawaal par wo kahatee hai ki, hamaare parivaar kaa congress se purana naata rahaa he, indira ji hamaare ghar aayaa jaaya karti thim, main priyanka se prabhavit hoon, isliye congress main shaamil hui hum
 However, Akhilesh Singh is also busy winning only his daughter instead of Congress
 akhilesh bina camere ke media se baat karte hue priyanka kii tarif karte hai, lekin jodate hai ki, meri congress se nahin bani, par beti ne sahi faisla kiya he, kyonkiuski priyanka se sidhe tuning bani he
 However, the ill-mannered Akhilesh has not changed his style, he is angry at every small thing, but his supporters consider it his role
 jiske chalate wo kisi ke liye robin hud hai, kisi ke liye don to kisi ke liye apradhi chhavi ke netaa hai
 Although Akhilesh did not care about his image, but his daughter takes care of it, she is gentle with all the supporters
 aditi ko apane pita kii takat kaa puraa andaja he
 On the question of Priyanka Gandhi not campaigning, she says that she had come to Rahul ji's meeting, campaigned, enough
 ab wo prachaar karne nahin aa raheen to koi baat nahin, wo to jeet hi rahi hai
 Aditi is contesting her first election under the shadow of her father's politics
 videsh main padhi likhi, ek noujvaan mahila ke taur par aditi, pita kii siyaasi viraasat to sambhaal rahi hai, lekin don yaa apradhi chhavi ke netaa kii beti kii jakadan se khud ko dur rakhane kii koshish karti bhi nazar aati hai

 kanoon mantri kebotla housapar die gaye is bayaan ke baad ab congress mahasachiv digvijay singh se kuch bolte nahin ban rahaa, varanasi main jab digvijay singh se salmaan khushird ke bayaan par pratikriya maangi gai, to unhone ise salmaan khurshid kaa vyaktigat bayaan bataate hue kaha ki ise party kaa bayaan na mana jaae
 Digvijay Singh said that i do not know whether the pictures of Batla House were shown to Sonia Gandhi or not
 haalanki ye koi pehla maamla nahin he, jab congressi netaaon ne bottla house encounter ko farji bataaya he
 Before this, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh himself has also called the encounter several times fake, but it is worth noting that Home Minister p Chidambaram himself does not see anything wrong in the Batla House encounter

 Amidst all this, a second Kamdabavka region in the Bay of Bengal is also going to be built in the next 48 hours
 ye kam dabaav kaa kshetra bhi deep depressant main tabdeel hokar purvi bharat se lekar madhya bharat tak barish de saktaa he

 aai em looking forward tu ower meeting
 "when Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Prashant Bhushan sent a SMS to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal wishing him well after returning to Delhi from Bangalore for a cough, he wrote in reply," i have returned
 maine kuch logon ko aapse baat karne ke liye kaha he
 i am just now preparing for the budget, then see you
 "is sandesh ke baad 21, 22, 23 march kii teen din kii baithak main aap netaa sanjay singh, ashutosh, ashish khetaan kii yogendra yadav, prashanth bhushan, pro
 There was a meeting with Anand Kumar etc
 maamla sulajhane ke kagaar par tha, lekin baat ek chaay kii pyaali par aakar tham gai
 The opposing side raised the question, who would trust this consensus? Therefore, it was proposed to have Prashant and Arvind discuss tea so that the bitterness between friends would be removed
 lekin sutron ke mutabik sanjay singh ne kaha, "itnaa to bharosa karnaa padegaa
 "prashant was uprooted and said that this is happening for the third time that he himself is retreating after agreeing on his part
 baat yahaan bigadi to baagi netaaon ko rashtriya parishad se nikaalane kii dhamkee de di gai
 The political earthquake that arose from it also shook the dreams of the common volunteers on which you had climbed the ladder of power a month ago
 lekin pehle party main tut, phir media or ab shashan main takaraav ne aam jan kii ummiido ko ashankaon main badal diya he
 Then brought the same controversy, hoping that Kejriwal was given an absolute majority by the people of Delhi, then his initial steps conveyed that the imagery of a new model that has shaken traditional politics will now take shape
 unhone dharna-pradarshan yaa takaraav-matbhedon se hatakar pradhanmantri narendra modi, grih mantri rajnath singh, shahari vikaas mantri venkaiya naidu sareekhe mantriyon se milakar sahyog maanga to laga ki ab kejariwal kaa andaaj alag hoga
 But it is also a fact that Kejriwal government and disputes have been closely related
 pehle 49 dinon kii sarkaar main kejariwal ne dilli police ke inspectoron or asipi ke nilamban ko lekar ganatantr diwas se thik pehle rajpath ke najadik rail bhawan par dharna diya tha to is baar naukarshahon kii niyukti-sthanantaran ke mudde par uparajyapal najeeb jang se hi sidhi ladaai thaan lee he
 The matter reached Rashtrapati Bhavan and Kejriwal attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi by writing a letter
 haalanki yah ladaai kejariwal sarkaar ke us aadesh se shuru hui jisamen unhone adhikariyon ko nirdesh diya ki uparajyapal ke paas vahi file bheji jaae jo jaruri ho or vah bhi mukhyamantri daftar ke jariye
 But the Lt
 Governor considered it a violation of rights and expressed his displeasure by writing a letter to Kejriwal
 maamla tab badha jab mukhya sachiv ke
 K
 sharma ne kuch ipies adhikariyon kii tainaati se judi file sidhe uparajyapal ko bhej di
 Irked by this, Kejriwal issued a show cause notice to Sharma, while he argued that the police case was not connected to the Delhi government
 phir bhi notice se khafa sharma ne paariwarik vajah bataakar chuttee le lee
 After this, Kejriwal and the Lieutenant Governor got involved in the appointment of Shakuntala Gamlin, the Principal Secretary of the Department of Energy, on behalf of the Lieutenant as Acting Chief Secretary in such a way that they openly accused Gamlin of colluding with the power companies at a rally in Burari, while the panel His name was in sau dinon main sarkaar ke saath vivaad kii fehrist yahi khatm nahin hoti
 The case of the fake degree of Law Minister Jitendra Singh Tomar is in the High Court, and the case of the alleged fake degree of another MLA Surendra Singh has come up
 vidhayak naresh baalyan par chunaav ke dauraan sharaab baantne kaa aarope lag chukaa he to ek nigam ke ek adhikari ke saath duvryavhaar ke maamle main jaranel singh kii giraftaar tak kii naubat aa gai thi
 But Kejriwal not only avoids any kind of investigation on these matters, but goes ahead and gives a slender chit
 party gathit karte vakt 2012 main ek saakshaatkaar main unhone isi samvaadadaata se kaha tha ki party ke kisi netaa par aarope lagata he to maamle kii jaanch aantarik lokapal ko saunpenge or phir karrwai karenge
 Challenging aaps, Aam Aadmi Party, which came to power by winning 67 of the 70 seats of Delhi with a pleasant feeling of cold winter, is looking scorched in the first heat of the changed season
 jeet ke baad party ko kabje main lene kii jang paramparaagat raajnneeti ko dhwast kar 'nae model' kii pairokaar party ko do-faad kii ore khinch le gai
 On March 5, Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav were expelled from the Political Affairs Committee (PAC) at the national executive meeting on Kejriwal's formula of 'one person, one post' voiced their exit
 lekin yah faisla aankadon ke lihaaj se kejariwal ko chaunkaane vaala tha
 Of the 22, 11 voted in favor of the motion, but 8 openly supported bhushan-yadav, while three remained neutral
 isse kejariwal gut ko laga ki party kaa ek bada khemaa tut saktaa he or ek sting main kejariwal yah kehete sune gaye the ki ve apane 67 vidhayakon ke saath nai party bana lenge or aap vahi log (bhushan-yadav-anand-ajit jha) chalaa len
 This was followed by another attempt at reconciliation, but when it did not happen, four senior leaders were expelled from the National Council and finally the party
 lekin nishkasit netaaon ne haar nahin maani or swaraj abhiyaan naam se ek manch bana liya
 With the formation of this platform, the number of people who resigned from the Aam Aadmi Party increased, more than 300 activists resigned simultaneously in Maharashtra and a large number of people from other states also joined this campaign
 haalanki yah manch abhi rajnatik rup nahin le sakaa he
 But Swaraj campaign convenor Prof
 anand kumaar kehete hai, "party main do-faad se zyada kii sthiti he
 The reason for the ability of a tremendous immediate unity within AAP is the ownership of Delhi's government for the next five years
 isliye bahut se log dil or dimag ke bich kaa antadrvandv jhel rahe hai, lekin dilli ke baahar jo aam aadmi party kaa parivaar he usamen isko lekar koi khaas duvidha nahin he
 "however, AAP spokesperson Ashutosh rejects the claim of two-tearing and considers it merely disciplinary action
 (dekhen donon se baatcheet) bhale aap isse inkaar kare, lekin swaraj abhiyaan ne do saal baad hone vaale dilli nagar nigam chunaav main sabhi 272 siton par ladgaye kii ranneeti bana lee he
 Leaders associated with this campaign believe that just like the wind of Modi in nine months, if the Kejriwal government continues to follow the current pattern, then it will also be punctured
 abhiyaan ne apni kshamta ke mutabik bihar, upi, punjab, uttarakhand vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi utarane kaa man banaaya he
 Why the disillusionment has been successful in stopping the victory chariot of Narendra Modi in Delhi, why did his only trusted partner get away from Kejriwal in such a short time
 party main is kadar aapasi vishwaas tha ki party ke jhande main bhi kejariwal kaa photo sweekaar kar liya gaya
 a former AAP leader says, "none of the world's political parties or dictators Gaddafi and Maotsetung were even photographed in the flag
 lekin hamane kejariwal kaa photo sweekaar kiya par unhone hamaari krupa ko apana adhikaar samaj liya
 During Jantar Mantar's AAP rally, farmer Gajendra's suicide also shocked aap's credibility as all the leaders of AAP including Kejriwal were present there
 lekin khudakushi kii ghatana ke baad bhi party ne raily nahin roki
 How much promises have been made In Amaldilli, the AAP government has fulfilled its promise of electricity and water touching the pulse of the public
 lekin 49 din main janalokapal bill ke mudde par sarkaar chhodie vaale kejariwal is baar is par khamosh hai
 Instead of taking any formal initiative towards granting full statehood status to Delhi, the government has directly confronted the central government on minor issues
 mahilaon kii suraksha kaa masalaa bhi jor-shor se chunaav main uthaaya gaya tha
 There was also a promise to provide a security button in the mobile, to deploy marshals in buses, to install CCTV cameras, but this was not put by the government in its 100-day primary initiative
 haalanki ashutosh kaa daawa he ki agle do hafte main ditisi kii bason main marshall tainaat ho jaaenge
 The issue of giving free wi-fi to Delhi has been in dispute since day one
 chunaav main aap ne isamen kaarigari kii thi
 The manifesto released in Hindi and the hoardings posted at the time of the election, along with the photo of Kejriwal, said that free wi-fi is given to the whole of Delhi, but the English manifesto talks about public spaces
 yah suvidha bhi 2016 se pehle dilli vaasiyon ko nahimilne ja rahi
 Kejriwal government has fulfilled the promise of work on the issue of electricity and water in a hundred days
 lekin jis tarah se dilli main adhikaron ko lekar sanvaidhanik takaraav paidaa hua he, uske baad uparajyapal or mukhyamantri, donon ko samajhnaa hoga ki vyavastha niyam-kaayadon se chalegi, kalpanaaon se nahin

 The Modi government on Wednesday took a decision that could affect crores of bank account holders
 darasal, kendriya mantrimandal ne public sector ke teen bainkon ke vilay ko manjuuri de di he
 The banks that are going to merge are Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank
 is vilay ke baad desh kaa teesraa sabase bada bank vajood main aayega
 Before this comes the State Bank of India and ICICI Bank
 lekin sawaal he ki in bainkon ke vilay kaa khataadharakon par kya asar padegaa
 In this report, we are going to tell you the answer to this question
 bainkon ke vilay kaa makasad kya he?is vilay kaa makasad bhartiya bainkon ko vaishvik str par pratispardhaa main sakasham bananaa he
 The government believes that the operational efficiency of these banks will improve after the merger
 iske alaava laagat main katautee aegi or nayaa bank maujuuda kai pratispardhi bainkon ko maat de sakegaa
 This scheme will come into existence from April 1, 2019
 kisko phayda-kisko nuksaan?sarkaar ke is kadam kaa sabase bada phayda dena bank ko milane vaala he
 Actually, Dena Bank is now under the scope of Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) due to large burden of stranded debt (NPA)
 isi vajah se is bank par koi karj dene ko lekar pabandi lagi hui he
 At the same time, Bank of Baroda may have to bear its loss
 in bainkon ke vilay ko lekar kuch saalon pehle arabiai ke purv governor raghuram rajan ne bhi sawaal khadey kiye the
 He said during a lecture in January 2014 that if we merged a sick bank with a big healthy bank, it could cause problems for a big healthy bank at the time of merger
 kya bank of baroda kaa naam bhi badalegaa ?sarkaar kii ore se is baat ke sanket die gaye hai ki brands pahchaan ko kaayam rakhaa jayega
 That is, after the merger, the name of Bank of Baroda will remain
 is vilay ke baad banane vaale bank of baroda ke paas kul 9401 bank shakhaaen or kul 13432 atm ho jaaenge
 Will the employees also lose their jobs? After the merger of the banks, one of the most important questions is whether the employees working in Dena Bank or Vijaya Bank will be laid off? So the answer is - not at all
 darasal, buudhvaar ko faisle kii jaankaree dete hue kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha, " is vilay se in bainkon ke karmchaariyon kii seva sharton par koi prabhaav nahin padegaa or vilay ke baad koi chantni bhi nahin hogi
 "what is the effect if there is a customer? If you have an account in any of these three banks, you may have to face some changes
 SBI ke ritred CGM sunil pant ke mutabik achaanak customer par koi asar nahin padegaa lekin dhire-dhire bainkon ke checkbuk, acount number yaa customer idi main badlaav sambhav he
 At the same time, after the new bank comes into existence, you may have to do a new KYC of your account
 lekin aapke lone par koi asar nahin padegaa or na hi aapaki iemai badalegi
 On the other hand, GS Bindra, former Chief General Manager, Punjab & Sindh Bank, says that the IFSC codes of bank branches can be changed after the merger
 iske alaava bank ke kuch branch band ho sakati hai or customers ko nai branch main janaa pad saktaa he
 However, the board will take a final decision on these changes
 aapako kya karnaa chahie?agar aap in bainkon ke customer hai to yah sunishchit karen ki aapkaa email adress or mobile number bank ke paas apadated he yaa nahin
 The advantage of this is that you will get instant information about any change of the bank

 Talking about the results of the elections of five states, there was some sadness for the Left parties and there was sadness
 kerala kii jeet par khush to pashchim bengal kii haar par afsos
 That is, if the peacock looks at its wings and dances and feet, then weep
 haalanki sipiiem ke daftar ke bheetar kuch halchal rahi lekin baahar sannata or khamoshi
 The joy of victory in Kerala, even if sadness came over Bengal, they left by giving formal bytes
 sabase pehle ain vrinda karaat
 Aajtak spoke and started smiling at the Kerala cadre as Zindabad
 kaha pichley das saalon ke hamaare sangharsh kii jeet or udief kii janvirohi nitiyon kii haar hui he kerala main
 As soon as the mention of West Bengal was mentioned, the color of the face changed and also the tone
 abhi saare nattejey aane dijie tabhi kuch kahuungi
 We raised the next question that the results have not been completed even in Kerala, but you showed great enthusiasm in it
 khisiaya sa jawaab aayaa - are bhai nattejey to aane dijie
 What is so hurting to you? Prakash Karat, who came to light, came to Jashnafir and was followed by CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury
 donon ne yahi kahkar pallaa chhudaaya ki abhi nattejey puure aaenge, tab baat karenge
 Then the results also came
 sipiem paulitte beuro ne baithak kii or 4 baje press conference tay kar di
 Ahead of the press conference, around 10-12 activists from Kerala came to the CPM headquarters and started shouting slogans
 neelotpal basu, seetaram yechuri or subhashini ali ne kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit kiya
 With this, the celebration ceremony at the headquarters was paid
 kahin honge vaade puure to kahin haar kii samikshasipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri press conference main aae
 As soon as he said, we have fought this election war like soldiers
 ham to sainik hai
 We won on one front and lost on the other
 jeet ke baad ham jaldi hi janata se kiye vaade puure karenge or rahi haar kii baat to iske kaarnon kii padtaal ke liye ham baithenge or vichaar karenge
 Even against the Congress, the same question arose with the Congress that the results have made your situation strange
 kerala main aap congress ke khilaaf hai or pashchim bengal main sahyogi
 In such a situation, even the head of the Congress is not able to burst
 seetaram kaa jawaab yahi are bhai vahi to kah rahaa hum
 Will sit and investigate the reasons
 ghuma phiraa kar phir vahi sawaal aae to ajiz seetaram bol hi pade - aap log ghode ke aage gaadi kyon laga rahe hai
 Hey, we will sit and think

 Said to respect the decision of the voters of West Bengal but regretted the division of votes for the vote in Tamil Nadu and Assam

 Yechury said that there are attacks on our cadre
 hamen dhamkaaya ja rahaa he
 We are victims of violence but we will not give up
 kerala kii tarah ham phir jeetenge
 bjp's victory led to increase in communal elements, the central leadership of CPM also argued that bjp's coming to power in Assam is the rise of communal elements in the Northeast
 janata ko saavdhaan rahanaa hoga
 At the same time, due to the wrong policies of political parties and nurukushti, BJP has got admission in West Bengal and Kerala Legislative Assembly
 is par ham to vichaar kar hi rahe hai
 It is better to think seriously about the rest of the secular forces
 jharkhand vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi mishan-65 plus ke lakshya ko hasil karne ke liye ranneeti bana rahi he, lekin vahiin, jharkhand congress main sir-phutuval machaa hua he
 Congress Pradesh President Dr
 ajay kumaar or purv kendriya mantri subodhakant sahay ke samarthak guuruuvaar ko aapas main bhid gaye
 The battle for supremacy between the two factions has not happened for the first time, even before it has been fiercely fought
 dar yah he ki ajay-sahay ke bich jari ladaai main kahin vidhansabha chunaav main congress kii lutiyaa hi na dub jaae
 There has been a ruckus since the election
 Let us know that since the Lok Sabha elections there has been a political rift between Ajay Kumar and Subodh Kant Sahay
 ajay kumaar ke pradesh adhyaksh pad se hataane ke liye sahay gut ke netaaon ne ghoda khol rakhaa he
 Recently, many Congress leaders of Jharkhand under the leadership of Subodh Kant had come to Delhi and met senior party leaders and asked to replace Ajay Kumar and hand over the command of the party to another leader
 rahul gandhi ke istife ke baad congress ke rashtriya adhyaksh ko lekar abhi tak tasviir saaf nahin hui he
 Due to this, the party has not been able to take any decision regarding the Jharkhand state president
 iske chalate dow
 Ajay Kumar remains in his post
 ajay kumaar kii adhyakshata main guuruuvaar ko congress bhawan main 81 vidhansabha prabhariyon kii baithak ho rahi thi
 Meanwhile Rakesh Sinha and Surendra Singh of Subodh Kant Sahai's faction reached the party office, who have been expelled from the Congress party two days ago
 congress se nishkasit donon netaa apane samarthakon ke saath press conference karne vahaan pahunche the
 Already present in Congress Bhavan
 ajay ke samarthakon ne mukhya darwaja band kar inhen ghusane se roak diya
 It was from here that a dispute started between the two groups and there was a tu-tu-main-i between the supporters of the two leaders
 is dauraan dow
 Ajay Kumar's supporters started making objectionable remarks against Subodh Kant
 vahiin, subodhakant ke samarthak bhi ajay kumaar go back ke naare lagane lage
 After this, the matter reached a jolt
 kaaryakarta ugr hone lage to congress bhawan parisar kii ore se patharbaji shuru ho gai
 The police had to lathi sticks to dislodge the mob as the dispute progressed
 isamen kai logon ko chot bhi lagi
 Accusations being made on each other
 ajay kumaar ne kaha ki virodh karne waalon se vyaktigat ladaai nahin he
 He said, 'the protest is going only on familyism
 netaa ko khud bhi tikat chahie or betaa-beti ko bhi
 The Congress party does not belong to anyone's father
 tut saktaa hum
 Can't bend main ochhi raajnneeti nahin karata hum
 At the same time, Rakesh Sinha, who was expelled from the Congress, gave Dr
 ajay par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki inhen party samvidhan kii jaankaree nahin he
 On one hand Modi is playing with the constitution of the country and on the other hand Dr
 ajay kumaar congress ke samvidhan ke saath khel rahe hai
 This suggests that BJP and Drs
 ajay kumaar tii-20 match khel rahe hai
 This is the third time the Congress workers have clashed after the Congress' Lok Sabha election
 loksabhaa chunaav main haar kii samiksha ko lekar ranchi pahunche prabharee arpyen singh kaa congress bhawan main kaaryakartaaon ne virodh kiya tha
 With this, Dr
 ajay ko hataane kii maang hui thi
 After this, three days before the recent dr
 ajay kumaar kaa virodh kiya gaya tha
 After this, many activists of the Sahai faction were expelled by Ajay Kumar
 guuruuvaar ko ek baar phir congress bhawan main dow
 Ajay and Subodh Kant supporters clashed with each other
 donon guton ke netaa dilli talabacongress ke rashtriya sanghathan mahasachiv kasee venugopal ne pradesh congress main ho rahe vivaad ko lekar dilli main teen agast ko baithak bulaai he
 It will include mlas Alamgir Alam, Sukhdev Bhagat, Pradeep Balmuchu, Manoj Yadav, Dadai Dubey, Rajesh Thakur, besides the president of the organization, front and department
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad se pradesh adhyaksh dow ajay kumaar va purv kendriya mantri subodhakant sahay ke samarthak aamane-saamne hai
 In such a situation, to see which faction falls heavily on the meeting in Delhi on Saturday
 pune main somvaar subah hiskool ke exam shuru hone se 30 minute pehle vatrup par iskaa paper li ho gaya
 10 am on whatsapp 20 minute par exam haul main teacher ke paas vatrup ke jariye paper pahunchaa
 By the time the information was given to the officials, the paper also reached them through whatsapp
 is ghatana par mumbai diviginal board secretary wies chandrekar kaa kahana he ki yah paper li hone jaisi ghatana nahin he
 Because when the photo of the paper was found through whatsapp, the students had gone to the exam hall
 yah kisi student ke class room main mobile le jaakar photo bhejne kii sharaarat jarur ho sakati he
 He also said that the incident was detected at 11 am
 30 baje laga, jiske baad isaki soochna fouran mumbai board offis ko di gai
 We are finding that according to the board rules, a student is strictly forbidden to take the phone with him during the exam
 aise main yah kaise sambhav hua
 Officials have also confirmed that the examinations will not be conducted again
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle centre kii modi sarkaar ko gherne ke liye aam aadmi party ne taiyaari tej kar di he
 a 'dictatorship remove-democracy-save rally' has been called to host the Aam Aadmi Party at Jantar Mantar in Delhi on 13 February
 'aap' netaa gopal raay ke mutabik is raily main shaamil hone ke liye deshbhar ke vipakshi dalon ke saath-saath congress ko bhi aamantrit kiya gaya he
 Now the question arises whether Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi will be seen simultaneously targeting PM Narendra Modi on 13 February from the platform of Jantar Mantar? Gopal Rai said that the Aam Aadmi Party is hosting a rally to be held at Jantar Mantar against the Modi government
 is raily main un tamaam vipakshi dalon ko bulaayaa gaya he jo kolkata ke brigade ground main shaamil hue the
 Further, AAP leader Gopal Rai said, "the work is going on with the opposition parties across the country under the leadership of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu
 hamen puri ummid he ki sabhi vipakshi dalon ke log 13 farvari ko taanaashaahee hataao loktantr bachaao satyagrah main shaamil honge"vahiin dilli congress kaa adhyaksh shila dikshit ne kaha he ki unhen aam aadmi party se iskaa nyauta nahin mila he
 This will be considered after the invitation is received
 iske alaava aam aadmi party ne dilli main ek nae campagne kii shuruyaat kaa elaan kiya he
 After the rally on February 13, AAP mlas and councilors from Delhi will campaign against the Modi government
 15 farvari se shuru hone ja rahe is campagne kii kaman vidhayak or parshadon ke haath main hogi, jo ghar-ghar jaakar logon se baatcheet karenge
 The strike of the MCD employees against the Kejriwal government continues for the third consecutive day
