 kolkata ke bigrade maidan main vipaksh ke 22 dalon kii mega raily hui
 Through this rally, an attempt was made to give a message to the country that a third option in the country, ie the United Front, has been prepared
 ab kya guarantee he ki modi sarkaar ko haraane ke liye khud ko ekajute karne main juta vipaksh, agar kaamyaab ho bhi jaataa he to pradhanmantri kii kursi ke liye tuutakar bikhar nahin jayega
 However, history is witness that whenever the opposition is united against the ruling party
 tab-tab sattadhari party ko haarana padaa he, lekin itihaas ye bhi kahata he ki chote or kshetreey dalon kii khichdi sarkarein zyada din tik nahin paati hai
 The tenure of these governments has been at most one year
 aankade to yahi bataa rahe hai
 Janata Dal, which won 143 seats in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections, formed the government with the support of BJP and other smaller parties
 veepi singh pradhanmantri bane lekin 343 din hi rah paae
 - Janata Dal broken and new party formed as Samajwadi Janata Dal
 iske netaa chandrashekhar desh ke pradhanmantri bane, lekin wo sirf 223 din hi sarkaar chalaa paae or 1991 main dobaaraa loksabhaa chunaav karwaane pade
 - BJP won 161 seats for the first time in the 1996 Lok Sabha elections
 anya partiyon ke samarthan se atal bihari bajpeyi pehali baar desh ke pradhanmantri bane
 His government lasted only 13 days

 com / aq7i5zsjmz— Mamata Banerjee (@mamataofficial)january 19, 2019- congress ne devegoda sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya, lekin chunaav taalane ke liye congress ne indra kumaar gujral ke netritv main is gathbandhan ko phir se baahar se samarthan de diya, lekin united front kii gujral sarkaar 332 din hi chal pai
 In about two years, this government fell by changing 2 prime ministers
 - 1998 main loksabhaa chunaav main janata ne ek baar phir kisi party ko bahumat nahin diya
 This time the BJP formed a government with many parties with 182 seats and Vajpayee became the Prime Minister of the country for the second time, but after 13 months of running the government, a no-confidence motion came against the Vajpayee government, due to a vote of AIADMK, Vajpayee's government fell
 isliye desh ko phir chunaavon main janaa padaa
 That is, the United Front may be formed in the name of opposition unity in the mirror of history, but the United Front government has never been able to complete its term and the country has been pushed into elections ahead of time
 ab ek baar phir modi sarkaar ke khilaaf fedral front taiyaar he
 At the Kolkata rally, Mamta Banerjee also claimed that our coalition government would do better than the Modi government, but it seems difficult to achieve this in terms of history

 Speaking of technology-savvy PM Mila Khushansibi: According to the news of Mukesh Ambani techcrunch, this feature was first tested among users in Ireland in January
 fasebuk ke yugers duniyabar main bahut zyada hai
 Last year, this clone of Snapchat was brought on Instagram and last month on whatsapp, it became clear that the company is ready to bring this feature to every platform
 chunki fasebuk ke yugers sabase zyada hai isliye company ise apane main ap main bhi ab laa rahi he
 After coming to some countries, there is a possibility that it will soon be launched for the world
 ab Idea se ek hi keemat main karen 2G, 3G yaa 4G data richargesbase dhyaan dene vaali baat ye he ki jitani taadaad main log fasebuk upyog karte hai utana instagram yaa snapchet ko nahin karte
 In such a situation, the introduction of this feature in Facebook will give a new experience for those who have not yet tried this feature of Story in whatsapp
 baharhaal, ye dekhnaa kaaphi dilachasp hoga ki bharat main isfesabuk storice launch hone ke baad ise kaisaa rispons miltaa he kyonki whatsap par isi feechar ke liye acchhee pratikriya dekhne ko nahin mili thi

 However, late in the evening, Sadhana Singh and his sons Kunal and Karthikeya had reached the new house

 yah seat bijepi kaa vah garh he, jahaan pehali baar 1989 main jeet darj karne ke baad se 2014 tak kabhi bhi party ko haar kaa munh nahin dekhnaa padaa
 In such a situation, will it be interesting to see whether the BJP will be able to protect its impregnable fort in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as usual or will change the political equation in the 2017 assembly elections

 Initiatives like Lokpal and Lokayukta Act, RTI Act, Citizen Charter, online services have been taken to prevent corruption
 lekin ye aparyaapt hai
 In 2014, the Lokayukta and Lokpal Act passed from Parliament
 iske baad bhi 12 rajyon—jammu-kashmir, manipur, meghalaya, mizoram, nagaland, puduccheri, tamilnadu, telugana, tripura, arunachal pradesh, dilli or pashchim bengal main lokayukta kii tainaati nahin hui
 It is also the country's misfortune that the Lokpal Bill was introduced in Parliament for the first time in 1968, but even after 50 years, the country could not get the Lokpal
 19 july, 2018 ko prastaavit lokapal chayan samiti kii baithak bhi netaa pratipaksh ke inkaar ke baad nahin ho saki
 Although in the last week of September, the central government created a Lokpal search committee headed by retired Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai, but the names could not be finalized
 janvari, 2019 main supreme court ne cameti ko naamon kaa panel farvari ke ant tak final karne ko kaha he
 Apparently, the tenure of the Modi government has passed without the Lokpal
 supreme court ke purv nyaayadhish or karnataka ke purv lokayukta justise santosh hegade kehete hai, ''lokapal bhi utana majboot nahin he
 The Lokpal does not have the right to take cognizance
 jaise adhikaar karnataka main pehle lokayukta ke paas the vaise hi lokapal ke paas hone chahie
 "on the other hand, Lokayuktas are deployed in states but there is also a lack of infrastructure for them in many states
 ashvini upaadhyaay kehete hai, ''meri kuch lokayuktaon se baatcheet hui to pataa chalaa ki unka utsaah thanda pad chukaa he
 They do not have manpower and infrastructure

 diggaj vakil prashanth bhushan kehete hai, ''philhal karpshan khatm hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 The government is not even creating Lokpal
 vicellabloar act bhi nahin laa rahi he
 Actually, these people (in power) are getting the benefit of not ending corruption

 RTI activist Ajay Dubey from Madhya Pradesh says, "corruption has reduced with the right to information and it has not been that easy
 'isse jaanch agenciyaan majboot hui hai
 Corruption has become a bit risky
 ab bhrashtachar vah shakchas kar paata he jo artiai ses (ghoose) de saktaa he
 To avoid this, the head of the department has to be managed, the information commissioner has to be managed
 dube kehete hai ki ab soochna ayog bhrashtachar kaa nayaa adda ban gaya he
 Cases are pending for many years in the Information Commission
 soochna ayuktaon kii sthiti rajyon main badtar he

 In the last five years, the Lokayukta in Madhya Pradesh has investigated only one minister, Gaurishankar Shejwar
 kerala main lokayukta ke nyaayadhikaar main rajnatik or prashasnic mashinari to aati he lekin use swatah sangyaan lene kaa adhikaar nahin he
 At the same time, online RTI is available only in Central, Delhi Government and Maharashtra, there is no other state
 jahaan tak citigen charter kaa sawaal he to zyaadaatar sarkari vibhaag ke daftaron main charter tange hai or pataa badalawaane jaise maamuli kaam inamen aasaani se ho jate hai

 Indeed, the work deadline in the Citizen's Charter is not binding and punitive
 duusari ore, centre sarkaar bhrashtachar nirodhak kanoon main hi sanshodhan kar rahi he
 Well-known advocate Prashant Bhushan on the proposed amendment says that there is a very bad provision in this, which has asked to get the government's permission for investigation
 sarkaar kii hi aap jaanch kar rahe hai or usee se anumati maangenge to kaise manjuuri milegi
 This provision has been brought twice before which has been rejected in the Supreme Court
 ab yah teesri baar bhrashtachar nirodhak kanoon main laayaa ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, government babus have also broken the online system
 logon ko pareshaan karne ke liye aajkal 'sarwar kharaab he' kii baat kahkar ghoose lene kii gunjaaish sarkari daftaron main banaai jaati he
 In monopolistic services like police, development authority, electricity corporation, there is more scope for bribe as people have no choice of these services
 pehle landline telephone conection lene or kharaab phone ko sudharwane ke liye logon ko dhakke khaane padate the or ghoose bhi deni padati thi lekin ab uplabdhta bad jane se phone ke liye ghoose dene kii baat kahin sunai nahin detii
 However, the Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi has started home delivery of 40 services like caste certificate, income certificate, residence certificate with an additional fee of Rs 50 from September 10, 2018
 lekin online aavedan karne main asamarth logon ko mohallon main baithe dallalon kii sharan main janaa pad rahaa he or jeb bhi dhili kerani pad rahi he
 These brokers are sitting online and according to the time taken in the work, they have made a rate list
 dilli main bahari log dallalon kaa sabase zyada shikaar banate hai
 Corruption and politics: Prashant Bhushan says that there is no problem in law, there is a problem in implementation
 jaise sibiai main apane logon ko laga do, ve aapke karpshan kii andekhi karte rahen to unke karpshan par aap kaise bolenge
 Police will put such people who keep doing your work then how will you stop them from taking money
 aise main peti karpshan kaise ruk saktaa he
 Bhushan says that there is a way to deal with this, but political funding should be tightened for this, but the government has loosened it further
 partiyaan jitna paisa chahen jisase le sakati hai
 The Prime Minister is asking farmers to be cashless but not cashless political parties

 Then why is our politics simmering after seeing a body swinging from a tree in Jantar Mantar?

 But now the matter has gone a long way
 kiran bedi ke poster par avasarwaadi likhakar party apane pranshaskon ke chehre par muskaan laane kii koshish karti he jabaki yahi baat kejariwal par bhi lagu hoti he
 That is, by presenting the words at your convenience, twisting and abusing the character is a model of the working of the Aam Aadmi Party
 is tarah ke party samaaj ke dabe-kuchle varg ko khush karnaa chaahati he
 But what has happened to BJP? The campaigners of the party have not left dignity in words and they have come out on personal attacks
 uske vigyapanon main bhashaa kii shaleenta nahin dikh rahi he
 They too are not deterred by personal attacks
 uske kuch saansad halki baaten karne ke doshi the lekin party kaa prachaar tantra aisi halki baaten likhegaa jisase uske khud ke bare main acchhee raay na bane to kuya kaha ja saktaa he
 The party is also following him on the map steps on which the Aam Aadmi Party is running
 yani donon ore se behad halki baaten ho rahi hai
 Can the gracious public of Delhi hope that the tradition of saying such mild things will end after the election results are out?

 Worshiping Lord Shiva is important on Monday
 somvaar ke din log vrath bhi rakhte hai, jise somshwar (someshwar) kaha jaataa he
 Someshwara has two meanings, first meaning Moon and second meaning Dev
 yani jise somdev (somdev) bhi apana dev maanate hai yani shiv
 According to Shiv Puran, worshiping Lord Shiva every Monday can relieve a lot of suffering
 mana jaataa he ki agar kisi vyakti par shivaji prasann ho jaaen to isse uski kundali se sabhi prakaar ke dosha dur jate hai
 With this, poverty is also relieved

 What to make for breakfast? Low-calorie, high-fiber oats cheela is the best healthy snack
 mana jaataa he ki shiv ko sachche man se yaad karne par ve madad karte hai
 Therefore, the method of worshiping Shiva is also considered very easy
 mana jaataa he ki bhole kii sachche man se puja karnaa hi kaaphi he
 It is believed that you can please Shiva only by worshiping with normal worship and sincere heart

 The reason for this is also believed that they are pleased with their devotees very quickly and whatever devotees offer they receive with pleasure
 phir bhi shiv ko bhoga main kuch chijen chadhaane kii manyata he
 Let us know about them - by offering things made of wheat to Shiva, you can please them quickly, it is believed
 - mana jaataa he ki eshwarya paane ke liye shiv ko mung kaa bhoga lagaaya janaa chahie
 - It is said that to get the desired life partner, Lord Shiva should be offered Bhog

 desh-duniya ke 214 iconomist ne bayaan jari kar kii mangamodi sarkaar se khapat sahit sabhi survey jari karne kii mangamedia main li report main daawa-khapat 45 saal ke nichle str paranobel puraskaar vijeta anges detone, french iconomist thomas picketti or yojana ayog (ab niti ayog) ke purv sadsy abhijit sen sahit desh-duniya ke 214 arthshaastriyon ne centre kii narendra modi sarkaar se maang kii he ki vah rashtriya sankhyikee karyaalay (NSO) ke survey jari kare
 This demand has come in the context of the leak of this report in the media, which said that India's consumer consumption has reached a 45-year low
 gauratlab he ki kuch dinon pehle bijness standard akhbaar ne yah daawa kiya tha ki NSO kii report li hokar use mili he or uske mutabik vitt varsh 2017-18 main upabhokta kharch saal 1973 ke baad sabase kam rahaa he
 What the Economist said: All these economists have issued a statement demanding that all the surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey Organization, including the 75th Consumer Expenditure, be released immediately
 arthshaastriyon ne aarope lagaaya he ki modi sarkaar is report ko is vajah se jari nahin kar rahi he, kyonki arthvyavastha kii susti ke is daur main yah sarkaar ke liye ek or badanaami kii vajah ban sakati he
 Consumption survey is very important to measure and monitor poverty and inequality in the country
 kya kaha sarkaar nekaryakram kriyanvayan mantralay ne safai di he ki pehle ke survey ke mukaable 'prashasnic aankadon' main zyada vichlan kii vajah se is baar abhi survey ke nattejey nahin jari kiye ja rahe hai
 The so-called leaked report said that consumer expenditure in the country has decreased in the country for the first time since 1973, due to weak demand in rural areas
 kai export pehle se hi isaki chetavanee de rahe the
 This is an indication that poverty is increasing in the country
 congress netaa priyanka gandhi ne bhi isko lekar sarkaar par sawaal uthaae the

 is aankade ko vitt varsh 2009-10 ko base year maanate hue mahangaai ke hisaab se samyojit kiya gaya he
 What the Leak Report Means According to Exports, the decline in consumer spending suggests that poverty is growing and demand in the economy has slowed and is headed by the rural market
 yah survey july 2017 se june 2018 ke bich hua tha
 Prior to this, during the reign of Indira Gandhi, there was a decline in consumption in 1973, when there was a big oil crisis globally
 gauratlab he ki iske pehle isi akhbaar main eneseso kii rojgaar kii report li hone par kaaphi hangaamaa khadaa hua tha, jisamen yah kaha gaya tha ki berogari kii dar 45 saal ke sabase oonche str par pahunch gai he

 The last few years have seen a huge change in the thinking of women
 jahaan pehle kii mahilaayein shaadi ko jivan kaa ek jaruri hissaa samajhati thim
 At the same time, today's women believe in being alone
 lekin kya kabhi aapane ye jaanane kii koshish kii he aakhir mahilaon main akele rahane kaa chalan itnaa aam kyon hota ja rahaa he? aaie jaane iske peeche ke kaaran
 
 
 Fear of losing freedom In most of the houses of our society, women are banned more than men and everything is according to men
 aise maahaul main mahilaon ko apni aazaadee khone kaa dar rahata he
 This is the reason why women now believe more in being single
 kyonki samay badal rahaa he ab mahilaayein purushon ke peeche nahin balki unase kadam se kadam milakar chalanaa chaahati hai
 Do you not say these things to your partner while fighting? After finding success in finding Mr
 Right, the expectations of women from their Mr
 Right are very high
 wo jaldi kisi ladke se santusht nahin hoti hai
 Women are left alone due to not getting a boy of their level
 haalanki kuch mahilaayein family ke pressure main aakar khud se kam safal ladke se shaadi kar leti hai
 The fear of breaking the heart is new, in every relationship, that time definitely comes when there is some conflict between the partners
 dhire-dhire ye anban gambhir ladaai kaa rup le leti he
 Due to which the relationship starts to crack and a beautiful relationship is on the verge of breaking up
 rishta tuutane ke dar se kuch mahilaayein single hi rahanaa pasand karti hai
 When there is a rift in the relationship, make the partner feel the love of the parents
 Today's women are more attuned to fulfilling their responsibilities towards their old parents than getting married
 umr ke is padaav par mata-pita ko akele chhodane kaa dar unhen shaadi kaa nirnay lene se roktaa he

 Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Saturday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 sonia kaa yah palatwaar narendra modi kii karnal raily main congress ko ukhaad phenkane ke bhaashan ke jawaab main tha
 At an election rally in Meham, Rohtak, Sonia said that the BJP is selling its successes as Congress
 sonia ne apni sarkaar kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki modi aisa maahaul bana rahe hai jaise desh main aazaadee ke baad ai sarkaron ne koi kaam nahin kiya he
 He also asked questions about Modi's promise to bring back black money in this rally
 sonia gandhi ne kaha, 'sarkaar aise pesh aa rahi he jaise aazaadee ke baad kii sarkaron ne desh ke liye kuch kiya hi nahin
 They are creating an atmosphere as if nothing has happened in the country after independence and they will change the fortunes of everyone overnight
 kya chunaav ke dauraan kiye gaye vaadon ko puraa karne ke liye koi kadam uthaaya gaya he?
 Taking a dig at the Modi government, the Congress president said, "what happened to the promise of bringing back black money from abroad within 100 days of his coming to power?" Have any steps been taken for this? off course not
 ' sonia ne kaha, 'kya mahangaai kam hui? kya garibon ko do june kaa khaanaa sasta milane laga yaa yuvaaon ko zyada rojgaar mili?
 'he said,' no country is formed in a day
 kisi bhi desh ke vikaas ke liye kai saalon kii kadi mehnat, sahi iraadaa or balidaan kii ichha chahie hoti he
 Accusing the Modi government of sabotaging the policies of previous Congress governments, he asked people not to be influenced by hollow promises

 Sonia told the people of the state, 'people will try to play with your feelings to get votes, make hollow promises at the time of elections
 is tarah kii koshishon se saavdhaan rahen
 Those who lure people with their false promises only to come to power have nothing to do with the progress of the state or the people
 'sonia ne kaha ki centre kii bijepi sarkaar upie kii yojanaon ko nayaa naam dekar use logon ke saamne pesh kar rahi he jabaki upie sarkaar ke dauraan usne inhen yojanaon kii aalochana kii thi

 keval congress party vikaas shuru karne kaa kaam kar sakati he

 yah air india ke us captain kii kahani he, jise apane yatriyon kii taraf se bolne ke liye 'viipi takat' kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Is it due to Union Minister Kiran Rijiju and Jammu and Kashmir Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh that late Captain Rohan Saharan of Air India Flight AI 446 is being made a 'scapegoat'? Exclusive information possessed by NDTV reveals the entire drama at Leh Airport operated by the Indian Air Force, which was a 'nightmare' for Captain Saharan
 24 june kii subah jab captain rohan sahaaran leh pahunche to unhen 'notice tu airmen order' (NOTEM) diya gaya, jisamen spasht likhaa tha ki airport kaa ranve 11 baje praatah tak riserphes (use udaan ke liye dobaaraa taiyaar) kiya janaa he, atah praatah 10:35 baje ke baad koi udaan nahin ja sakati
 They found out that they would have to fly the entire flight back, while there was already an uproar at the airport as boarding passes were not being issued to the three passengers with confirmed tickets
 sutron ke anusaar, unhone sthaneey adhikariyon ke saath baat kii, taaki in teen yatriyon - ek bhartiya videsh seva adhikari tathaa unka parivaar - ko unke boarding paas de die jaaen
 After this, they were informed by the local district administration and police officials that they would have to take 'three vips' in the same flight
 ab tak, captain sahaaran kaaphi chintit hone lage the
 According to one source, the weather was 'marginal' by then
 sada shabdon main kahen to iskaa arth tha ki mausam garm hone laga tha, or agar yah thodaa bhi or garm hota, to captain ko vimaan ko halkaa karne ke liye saamaan or yatriyon tak ko utaar dena padataa
 According to eyewitnesses, by now three passengers who were finally given boarding passes were sitting in a bus heading to the plane on the tarmac
 ve ek ghante tak vahaan baithe rahe, lekin unhen vimaan main savaar hone kii anumati nahin di gai
 Other passengers, who were furious over the plane not flying, started cursing the airline
 aakhirkaar, captain sahaaran ko lod tathaa sin karne ke liye trim shit de di gai - yah vah aakhri dastauez he, jis par payalat ko udaan bharne se pehle dastakhat karne hote hai - or unhone darvaaze band karne kaa aadesh de diya
 Despite their best efforts, the three passengers were sitting in a bus on the Tarmac, which was not allowed by the local authorities to board the plane
 vimaan ke darvaaze band hone ke baad viipi pahunche, or dabaav main captain ko unke liye vimaan ke darvaaze kholane pade
 By this time, the anger of the passengers boarding the aircraft had increased further, and they started hooting the vips who were the 'cause of delay'
 captain sahaaran ne taramac par tab bhi bas main baithe teen yatriyon kii ore ishaara karte hue donon rajanetaaon se kaha, "ham aap logon kii vajah se dedh ghante se bhi zyaada let ho chuke hai
 
 
 And look at the three people sitting in the bus who could not catch this flight because of you
 
 
 " sutron ke anusaar, is vakt kendriya mantri rigiju ne kaha ki unhen is baat kii koi jaankaree nahin ki unki vajah se vimaan ko deree hui, lekin nirmal singh or captain ke bich tej bahes ho gai

 Sources say that now the pilot is worried that he can be punished just for doing his job
 unhone mantriyon se sirf itnaa kaha tha ki "meraa kartavya mere yatriyon ke prati he

NDTV ke paas maujuud exclusive jaankaree kii badaulat bhartiya vayusena dwaara sanchalit leh airport par hue puure drame kaa khulaasa hota he, jo captain sahaaran ke liye 'bure sapane' jaisaa tha
 On the morning of 24 June, when Captain Rohan Saharan arrived in Leh, he was given a 'notice to Airmen Order' (NOTEM), which clearly stated that the airport's runway was to be resurfaced (it was ready for flight) by 11 am, so No flight can leave after 10:35 am
 unhen pataa chalaa ki unhen puri flite ko udaakar waapas le janaa hoga, jabaki airport par pehle se hi hangaame ke asaar the, kyonki concermd tikaton ke saath maujuud teen yatriyon ko tab tak bhi boarding paas jari nahin kiye ja rahe the
 According to sources, he spoke with the local authorities so that these three passengers - an Indian Foreign Service officer and his family - were given their boarding passes
 iske baad unhen soochna sthaneey jila prashasan or police adhikariyon dwaara soochna di gai ki unhen isi udaan main 'teen viipi' ko bhi lekar janaa hoga
 By now, Captain Saharan was beginning to get quite worried
 ek sutara ke mutabik, mausam tab tak 'marginal' ho chukaa tha
 To put it simply, it meant that the weather had begun to heat up, and if it had been a little warmer, the captain would have had to take off luggage and passengers to lighten the plane

 He sat there for an hour, but was not allowed to board the plane

 Eventually, Captain Saharan was given a trim sheet to load and sign - this is the last document the pilot has to sign before taking off - and he orders the doors closed
 unki puri koshishon ke baavjood ve teen yatri taramac par bas main hi baithe the, jinhen sthaneey adhikariyon ne vimaan main nahin chadhane diya
 The vips arrived after the plane doors were closed, and under pressure the captain had to open the doors of the plane for them
 is samay tak vimaan main baithe yatriyon kaa gussa or bad chukaa tha, or unhone 'deree kaa kaaran' bane viipi logon ko hoot karnaa shuru kar diya
 Captain Saharan, pointing to the three passengers still boarding the bus on the Tarmac, told the two politicians, "we have been late for more than an hour and a half because of you guys

 The top leaders of the party decided that they would hit the most fragile part of the UPA government
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh par hamalaa
 BJP President Nitin Gadkari, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley, Senior Leaders Murali Manahar Joshi, Rajnath Singh, Venkaiah Naidu, Jaswant Singh and Ravi Shankar Prasad all decided not to allow both houses of Parliament to function
 did
 inhone kaha ki koyala ghotaale par kaig kii report par sarkaar bhale hi sanyukt sansadeey samiti bana de yaa phir lok lekha samiti kii jaanch baitha de, ve peeche nahin hatenge
 This strategy was not very elaborate, but the BJP jumped into it strongly
 jarurat ke hisaab se badal rahi is ranneeti main philhal bijepi ne dotarafa rasta apanaaya he--sansad ko lagaataar baadhit kiye rahanaa or saath hi sadakon par virodh pradarshan karnaa
 Jaitley and Swaraj are at the center of the protests taking place within Parliament
 party ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, adwani ji donon ke hi kareebi hai
 They know that there is estrangement between the two, so they have clarified the roles of both
 ”ek ore, jetali sarkaar ke khilaaf apni daleelein majboot kar sansad ko thap karne ko sahi tehraane kaa kaam kar rahe hai to duusari ore sushamaa is baat ko sunishchit kar rahi hai ki party kii aawaaj sadakon par suni jaae
 As a result of this, he gave a statement, "congress made a thick material so that it could reach the public and become a topic of discussion among the people
" party ke ek netaa kaa kahana he, ‘’ve jaanate hai ki abhi nahin to kabhi nahin
 “there are daily meetings in Advani's room within Parliament, sometimes twice a day

 There could not be a better way for the BJP to surround the government because the coal scam directly tainted the Prime Minister, joining the issue of corruption, on which the propaganda has now gone to India Against Corruption
 The BJP holds a live issue for the assembly elections because it has to save its government in important states like Himachal and Gujarat
 
 ab jabaki bijepi ne sansad ke bheetar apane virodh ko us str par laa diya he jahaan se peeche hatana sambhav nahin, aglaa charan sadakon par dekhne ko milegaa

 BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman says people like Hansraj Ahir (chandrapur MP) have spent day and night collecting data on coal allocation
 ham bade tareeke se kaam kar rahe hai
 It is not just a matter of jumble in Parliament as the Congress feels that people will trust it
 ”is sab ke baavjood sawaal uthta he ki kya pradhanmantri ko sansad main bolne na dekar bijepi ne naitik str par nuksaan uthaaya he? jetali isse sahamat nahin, ‘’yah kahana ki sirf sansad main is par bahes ho, desh ke itihaas ke sabase bade ghotaale par paradaa daalane jaisaa hoga
 We are not interested in having a debate in Parliament just one day
 yadi aaj kisi bahes kaa istemaal javabdehi par mitti daalane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he, to ek vaikalpik ranneeti bahut jaruri he
 Applying a barrier also benefits, even if it happens in rare cases

 rafel saude par mahalekhaakaar kii (CAG) report jaise hi rajyasabha main pesh kii gai, vitt mantri arun jetali ne twits kii jhadi laga di- mahagathbandhan ko jhootha bataaya, nae-puraane saudon kii tulana par apni peeth thapthapai or kaha ki jo lagaataar jhooth bolte hai, loktantr unako isi tarah dandit karata he
 For the moment, postpone this digression as to how democracy was punished by Jaitley despite the Modi wave of 2014, but a closer look at the CAG report makes sense that the government is hiding the parts of the report where its weaknesses are seen Huh
 misaal ke taur par report main is baat kaa spasht ullekh he ki 2007 main jo sauda ho rahaa tha, usamen bank guarantee, parformens guarantee or varantee kii baat thi, jabaki 2016 ke saude main bank guarantee na rakhe jane kaa faaydaa bharat ko nahin, sidhe daso aviation ko mil rahaa he
 According to the report, Dassault Aviation had to give 15% bank guarantee on the advance payment made by the Government of India for this deal
 yah guarantee tab tak chalati rahati jab tak daso aviation se is raqam ke baraabar kii aapurti nahin ho jaati
 The bank charge for this guarantee would have been several million euros
 daso ke mutabik bank dar 1
 25 per cent would have been annually while this according to the Indian negotiating team
 38% padati
 Not only this, there was also a provision for Performance Guarantee and Warranty in 2007, according to which the company had to give 10% guarantee of the total contract price
 yah guarantee sari aapurti hone tak chalati jiskaa kul samay kareeb 5
 Would have been 5 years
 jab ye guarantiyaan nahin raheen to is bachat kaa phayda kisko mila? sieji kii report note karti he ki iskaa phayda daso ne uthaa liya, mantralay ko nahin diya
 But why is there no bank guarantee? This issue has been arising again and again
 sarkaar ke numaayinde bataate hai ki do samprabhu deshon ke bich jab sauda hota he to usamen ye choti-choti baaten nahin hoti hai
 But here too, many indications are found in the CAG report
 pehali baat to yahi saamne aati he ki bharat sarkaar ke kanoon mantralay ne baqayada salaah di thi ki france sarkaar ke saath samjhaute main bank yaa samprabhu guarantee lee jaae
 The French government neither agreed to the bank guarantee nor did the sovereign guarantee
 usne inaki jagah ek letters of confort pakadaa diya jis par uske pradhanmantri ke dastakhat the
 (just remember that in the French system, the President is the head of power, not the Prime Minister - the deal was done by the President, not the Prime Minister
 )baharhaal, sieji kii report bataati he ki 2016 main suraksha maamalon kii kendriya samiti ke saamne yah masalaa aayaa
 The question arose whether India should accept the letter of comfort? This was also approved by the Cabinet Committee on Security
 lekin saath main suzav diya ki france se agar samprabhu yaa bank guarantee na mil rahi ho to anya sambhddha guarantiyaan yaa aashwavastiyaan lee jaaen
 The committee also suggested that an escrow account be created and that the French government should monitor whether suppliers are using this account correctly
 lekin frans sarkaar ne kendriya samiti kaa yah suzav bhi nahin mana
 Finally it was agreed that an account would be opened in a bank controlled by France and the French side could control and monitor it
 sieji kii report main jo tathy sabase hairaan karata he, vah kisi kanoonee vivaad kii sthiti main bharat sarkaar kii haisiyat he
 The Government of India has entered into an agreement with the Government of France, but it will be dealt with by Dassault Aviation
 samjhaute ke mutabik agar koi vivaad hota he to bharat or daso ke bich arbitreshan- yani madhyasthata- kaa maamla banegaa
 If the decision in this arbitration comes in favor of the Government of India, then the liability of DASO will remain
 lekin daso agar kisi vajah se bhugtan karne ko taiyaar nahin hota to bharat ko duusare kanoonee vikalp talash karne honge
 When all these options are paid, the French government will pay on behalf of the Dassos
 sieji ne is par apni koi raay nahin di he, bas mantralay kaa jawaab natthi kar diya he
 According to the ministry, it is an agreement between two sovereign countries that are strategic partners
 iske alaava kanoon mantralay ke suzav par daso ke alaava france sarkaar ko bhi 'saajha or kai' str par javabdeh banaaya gaya he
 But this is the reality of the agreement between the two sovereign countries - in which the French government is treating the Indian government as just a party
 uski suraksha maamalon kii cabinet cameti ke suzav tak nahin maane ja rahe
 The rest of the Rafale prices are neither reported nor the offset partner has any accounting
 lekin yah sab na hote hue bhi chhupate-chhupate jitani baaten saamne aa ja rahi hai, unase jaahir he ki rafaal saude kii auditing sieji ke liye aasaan nahin rahi he
 This is when governments do something and want the message to go something else
 koi is par yakeen kar yaa na kare, lekin pakistan main 18 maheene ke bachche par 20 saal ke ek yuvak kii hatya karne kaa aarope laga he
 The police, presenting the child as the main accused, presented it before the judicial magistrate
 yah maamla pakistan ke tateey shahar karachi kaa he
 Judge Javed Akhtar was stunned when he saw the 18-month-old child Raees in court
 police adhikariyon kaa kahana tha ki rais hi mukhya abhiyukt he
 "when the child was presented to the judge, he was shocked," said a court official
 police ne kaha ki rais ne hi 20 saal ke alamgir kaa galaa kaat diya tha
 The judge ordered the police to bring out the actual accused
 bachche ke parijan kaa aarope he ki police asli mujrim ko bachaane ke liye maasoom rais ko aaropee banaaya he
 Congress ministers of the Telangana region, who are part of the Andhra Pradesh government, have rejected the proposed package instead of a separate Telangana state

 Bhojpuri cinema superstar Khesari Lal is bringing a new song on Holi

 Bhojpuri cinema's superstar Khesari Lal Yadav is making a big splash on the occasion of Holi
 khesari laal yadav ke bhojpuri holi song (bhojpuri Holi Song) 'rang daalala pe kaanhe bhagelu' ko utyub (youtube) par 21 lakh se zyada baar dekha ja chukaa he
 This Holi song by Khesari Lal Yadav was released on youtube on 5 February
 is bhojpuri song kaa mujeec ashish verma ne diya he jabaki iske liriks shyaam dehati ne likhe hai
 Khesari Lal Yadav had a few days ago
 
 
 ' (thik Hai) song kaa apadated varjan launch kiya he, jo holi par aadhaarit he
 Khesari Lal Yadav's' Okay
 
 
 ' (thik Hai) song ke holi varjan ko sunne ke liye kaaphi excitement dekhi gai

 The current controversy has tarnished the image of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice (CJI) and the collegium
 inamen bharosa lautne main ab kaaphi vakt lagegaa
 Our political community has never been comfortable with the idea of collegium
 lekin kaaphi lambey samay baad centre main ek purna bahumat vaali sarkaar ai he
 Coalition governments, despite their desire to make laws, could not dare to do so
 is baar sarkaar ne rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog (engeesi) laane or sanvaidhanik sudhaar karne kii koshish kii he, lekin ve atake pade hai
 i doubt that this government can do anything special in this matter
 ve nayaa kanoon laate hai, to ise samvidhan kii kasuti par parakhnaa hoga
 Politically sensitive issues have always gone before the Supreme Court
 har chif justise ke kaarykaal main samvedansheel maamle aate hi rahe hai
 i had adopted a very similar policy of handing over litigations to the benches: to give it on the basis of seniority
 yah sabase surakshit or shreshth tarika hota he
 It seems that there has been a consistent method of incumbent Chief Justice
 chaar jajon kaa aarope he ki unka yah tarika sahaj nahin he
 One might be curious as to how they can prove it
 lekin vastav main saarvajanik sansthaanon main kisi bhi rup main manamaanepan kii koi jagah nahin ho sakati
 It is not that you keep doing whatever you like, you can do whatever the constitution allows
 jajon ko lagata he ki kuch nirnyon main manamaanaapan dikh rahaa he, kuch anuchit lag rahe hai, to chif justise ko is kanoonee siddhant ko yaad karnaa hoga ki dharna nyaay ke liye sabase mahatvapurn hoti he
 Any institution is bigger than the people
 supreme court ko is tarah nahin chalane diya ja saktaa
 Complaints about justice should be made and resolved, until all parties are satisfied
 jo kuch hua use ab bhul janaa hoga
 i do not think it is a difficult thing
 jab is par saarvajanik rup se itani bahes ho rahi he to chif justise tak bhi sandesh to pahunch hi gaya hoga
 This solution has to be found and this solution must come from within
 isamen desh kuch nahin kar saktaa
 If it is within the scope of the Supreme Court, then the solution should be found in the Supreme Court itself
 ab court pehle kii tarah kaam karata rahegaa, kyonki nyaayik paksh main kuch nahin hua he
 But the injury is deep in the administrative side and has to be corrected
 iske liye pahal chif justise kii taraf se hi honi chahie
 The Chief Justice should call the rest of the judges for resolution
 virodh karne vaale jajon ne apane letters main kisi khaas masale kaa ullekh nahin kiya he, jabaki unhen chif justise ko yah bataanaa chahie ki ve kin khaas masalon kii baat kar rahe hai
 They are all intelligent people, they have worked in the judiciary for 20 to 21 years
 ek jaj hone ke naate yah bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa ki ve lacheele nahin hai
 There is also fairness in them
 unhen yah sochna hoga ki supreme court ek santhaan he, vyaktigat ladaai kaa akhaada nahin
 i sincerely hope that all the judges will come up with some mutually respectful solutions

 pradhanmantri narendra modi aadhaar card ke janmdata nandan nilekani ke behad impress hue hai
 It is said that Nandan Nilekani met Modi in the first week of July
 yah khabar ek angreji akhbaar ne di he
 Only then did Modi aim to register as many people as possible in the Aadhaar card

 Nilekani was given the command of this important scheme in 2009

 It is said that Nilekani had come to Delhi to vacate his government bungalow and during this time he had asked for an appointment with PM Modi

 Earlier they were supposed to get Rs 1,550 crore, but now this amount has increased to Rs 2,039 crore
 is pariyojna main bijepi ke kai netaaon kii bhi ruchi nahin thi or ve ise bahut tawvajo dene ke paksh main nahin the, lekin piem kii meeting ke baad ab halaat badal gaye hai
 Now the government is going to give importance to it again
 iske liye isaki vyavastha main badlaav karke ise chust-durust banaaya jayega
 It is said that Nilekani explained to the PM that if the Aadhaar card scheme is implemented properly, the government can save Rs 50,000 crore from the subsidy amount
 nilekani or modi kii meeting ke baad ab yah tay he ki aane vaale samay main aadhaar kaa zyada upyog hoga or ise kai mahatvapurn yojanaon se joda jayega

 tejasvi ne kaha, 'jis balb or sadak kii baat aap kar rahe hai naa ye 2004 se 2014 upie-1 or upie-2 jisamen hamaare rashtriya adhyaksh or aadarneey lalu ji railmantri, shri raghuvansh babu gramin vikaas mantri or tatkaaleen urja mantri ne daleey raajnneeti se upar uthakar bihar ke vikaas kaaryon ke liye aseemit fund dilwaaye, tab jaakar bihar ko yah sab naseeb hua
 And you have accepted this extraordinary contribution from the House to many public forums
 isamen aapkaa kitna yogadan rahaa yah aap apane dil par haath rakhkar puuchhie? aap 1998 se lekar 2004 tak centre main cabinet mantri rahe lekin bataae kitni raashi bihar ke vikaas kaaryon ke liye dilwaai
 If you have to do any comparative discussion and open debate on the financial assistance given to Bihar during the tenure of UPA and NDA, then i am ready for the challenge but i urge you not to confuse lying to the public
 'tejasvi ne kaha, 'aap us daur main bihar ke vikaas or centre dwaara sahaayta ko lekar sankeern or nakaaratmak soch ke saath bandhe rahe
 However, you were also saying that if the people writing letters from the prison came out of the jail, the lanterns would return
 aap bahut ghar-ghar balb jalaane kaa daawa karte hai naa? chachaa ji aaj ham bataate hai aapke is daawey kii kya hakeekat he? jab mujffarpur balaatkaar cond ke baad nai dilli ke jantar-mantar par desh ke nyaaypriy aam nagarikon ne ‘candal march' main pehali mombatti jalaai thi naa, us ek mombatti kii roshni ne aapke saare balb lagane ke daavon ko sharmasaar kar diya tha
 All the lights of Bihar were embarrassed in front of that one candle flame
 aapke dwaara bihar ko raushan karne kii pole us ek akeli mombatti ne khol di, or bataa diya tha duniya ko ki aapke raaj main kitna ghinauna syah andhera failaa he bihar main
 'he said,' Just as the candle is still needed to awaken the government, just as the lamp is still needed to celebrate the happiness on the festival, in the same way to drive out the thick black darkness of injustice and monstrous atrocities from Bihar
 Lanterns are still needed today and always will be
 aap jab yah kehete he ki rajd shasankaal main bijli ke pole or taron par log kapade sukhaate the to aap yah maan rahe he naa ki us vakt karant nahin tha lekin bihar main ghar-ghar or gaanv-gaanv bijli pahunchane ke infrastracchar kaa kaam shuru ho chukaa tha
 Now tell me, at that time, how many megawatts of total power generation capacity was there in the country under your NDA government in 2004 and how much in 2014 in the UPA government? Sir, you will get the answer yourself
 'tejasvi ne patr main likhaa, 'jo chalaae nafrat or hinsa ke tir, wo kya samajhegaa bihar kii peed
 You are giving a decree not to let our father out of jail, but a decree is also being heard by the public
 
 
 
 Listen to the voice of the public, which is saying in your rally
 
 
 aakhri charan kaa matdaan, phir NDA hoga arntadhyaan
 Sukh Chain will return, now the lantern will light up ' tejasvi ne kaha, 'yaad rakhiegaa satya pareshaan ho saktaa he parajeet nahin
 Sooner or later, the people of Bihar will get justice, and the voice of their right will soon be among them and then our father will take account of every injustice done on Bihar from the people of the mandate and lie, cheat and You will take opportunism to its rightful place, that is, the court of court and then to jail because you are not the rightful person to go to jail
 'tejasvi ne kaha, 'loktantr main janata kii adaalat sabase badi hoti he
 We accept every decision of his
 ham ladenge, jeetenge or aage badhenge
 
 
 Lanterns will light up, darkness will be afraid
 aisi abhivyakti mere swabhaav main nahin he lekin aapke jhooth kaa jawaab dena jaruri tha
 'tejashwi also wrote a poetry at the end of his letter
 
 
 jo is tarah he- wo samajhaae ja rahe the or ham samajhe ja rahe the
 
 wo khud na samajhe , hamen samajhane ke baad bhi

 com / yeywdve8cv — Harish Rawat (@harishrawatcmuk) October 18, 2018 raipur sahitya mahotsav main film or cinema par bolte hue film nirdeshak subhash ghai ne nai peedi ke bacchon ko sanskrit padhaaye jane kii vakaalat kii
 He said that Sanskrit is an integral part of our cultural identity
 subhash ghai ne kaha ki ham sanskrit main vivaah karte hai, sanskrit main havan karte hai, lekin apane bacchon ko sanskrit nahin padhaanaa chaahate
 this is wrong
 hamen apane bacchon ko sanskrit padhaani chahie
 Japan made its mark because that country never lost its language and fundamental values, so today Japan's national character is number one
 bhartiya paramparaon ko yaad karte hue subhash ghai ne kaha ki hamaara bhi rashtriya charitra kabhi hua karata tha, lekin hamane use kharaab kar diya
 Until we teach our children their language and culture, how will they know
 agar bharat ko vishwa guru bananaa he to yah apni bhashaa ke raste hi mumkin ho saktaa he or hamaari apni bhashaa sanskrit he
 Those who have watched Jayalalitha carefully, how much they should emphasize their memory, but they will not remember that Jayalalithaa ever appeared in a saree with sweat and wrinkles
 jayalalita ko jo kareeb se jaanate hai, unke liye bhi ve utani hi abujh paheli raheen jitani dur se unako dekhne waalon ke liye
 Here we are telling that 'amma' has been known for some such unique and different things about her
 padhane main ustadajayalalitapadhai main behad tej thim or iske liye unako scolership bhi mili thi
 But Jayalalitha also loved cooking, writing, swimming, horse riding
 jayalalita dwaara angreji or tamil bhashaa main likhe gaye kai lekh or upanyaas ab tak prakashit ho chuke hai
 During the shooting of films, he could be seen reading English books at break time
 haalanki in sabhi chizon ke saath vah clasical dance main bhi paarangat thim
 Her hair never appeared to be scattered, Jayalalitha used to pay a lot of attention to her appearance
 film star hone kaa yah pahalu unki shakhsiyat ke saath hameshaa judaa rahaa or isse unke phans main unki devi sareekhee chhavi bhi majboot rahi
 The size of her dot has always remained the same and it has never been seen moving here and there
 unki chotii bhi hameshaa ek hi tareeke se karine se bani hoti thi
 Usually, women should pay any attention, but their hair or look was spoiled at one time or another
 lekin unke liye 'bed hair de' jaisi koi baat kabhi nahin rahi
 The craze of saris and shoes was a craze for expensive saris and shoes
 unke yahaan jab CBI ke chaape pade the, tab unke paas se 750 jodi juute mili the
 Not only this, the waist belt studded with several kilos of gold and one and a half kilos of gems was also seized in this raid
 iske alaava, unke paas se 10,500 behad mahangi saadiyaan bhi mili thim
 There is also a special thing that he had a lot of love for dark colored sarees
 halke rang kii sari unhone shaayad hi kabhi pahani hogi
 At the same time, he has been particularly fond of wearing stoles and shawls
 bataaya jaataa he ki ek baar unhone bullate-pruf jacket ke upar bhi shawl odhi thi
 What is needed, the habit of want, Jayalalitha is also said to be angry and stubborn
 80 ke dashak kaa ek kissa to aaj bhi yaad kiya jaataa he-rajyasabha kii sadsyta ke dinon vah apni dilli yatra ke dauraan akasar tamilnadu bhawan main rahati
 For that, the staff there never forgot to prepare their special drink (gin and coconut water) of their choice
 lekin ek baar vahaan ke karmchaaree nariyal khareednaa bhul gaye
 At this point, he started breaking the glass of Tamil Nadu building
 aakhirkaar bhawan ke afasaron ne haryana bhawan se nariyal pani manga karajyalalitako unka pasandida drink pesh kiya
 Then she calmed down
 choti umr se kaam karne kaa dukhaunhone kai saal pehle ek tamil patrika ko die intervyuu main kaha tha ki unke pita ek aalsee insaan the, jinka kaam karne main man nahin lagata tha
 His mother had quit studying at the age of 16 and was forced to earn money by acting
 unhone yah bhi sweekaara tha ki bachapan kii yaaden taaja hone par aaj bhi unki kii ankhen chhalchala jaati hai
 At the same time people also say that he had a scattered childhood behind his irritable behavior
 kam hi log is baat ko jaanate hai ki jayalalita apni pehali tamil film us samay dekh pai nahin thim
 Actually this film got a certificate and she was only 16 years old then
 is film kaa naam tha Vennira Aadai yani safed vastra
 She was also famous as a dictator in the corridors of eccentric politics
 unki party ke log unako dandavat pranaam karte
 For Jayalalithaa, words like ruthless and ruthless Iron Lady were also used
 ise halaat kahen, vakt kii maar yaa phir unka apana nechar
 Whatever the reason, she was an expert in every game of glamor, power and politics
 unki sanak or dhun kaa ek udhaaharan dekhen -1989 main jab unhone vidhansabha main karunanidhi ke bajet pesh karne ke dauraan aapatti jataai thi to vahaan afratfari much gai thi
 And once such a situation was created that a senior DMK member tore his clothes
 tab unhone kasam khai thi ki ve vidhansabha main bataur mukhyamantri hi aaengi
 And they also showed this by completing it
 mahila adhikaron kii pakshadharavah mahila adhikaron kii jabardast pakshdhar bhi raheen
 In this direction, he also launched several schemes
 90 ke dashak main tamilnadu main mail-femail reshyo bahut gir gaya tha
 To prevent female feticide, he planned to adopt girls
 unki sarkaar ne pehali baar sirf mahilaon dwaara sanchalit kiye jane vaale police stesan shuru karwaae the
 Jayalalithaa had a quota of 30% for women in police jobs
 yahi nahin, jayalalita kii ore se aisi librari, store, bank aadi bhi chalavaae gaye the jinke sanchaalan kaa puraa jimmaa mahilaayein uthaati thim

 Suspense was maintained for a long time that who will be the heroine of Salman Khan i
e
 Chulbul Pandey in 'dabangg 3'
 lekin nirdeshak arbaj khan ne is raaj ko raaj hi rakhaa havaise is kadi main naam to kai heroins ke uchle lekin ab sutron ke anusaar kaajol ho sakati hai salmaan kii is film kii heroin
 It is being told that Kajol liked the script very much and Salman is also very excited to work with Kajol
 haalanki aupchaarik taur par abhi koi bhi bolne ko taiyaar nahin he lekin kaajol or salmaan ke saath kaam karne kii sambhaavna isliye bhi zyaada he kyonki donon paariwarik dost bhi hai
 Ajay Devgan is a close friend of Salman
 koun he salmaan khan kii parchaai shera
 
 
 Remind that the salman-kajolki duo has appeared on the film screen twice - 'kuch Kuch Hota Hai' and 'pyar Kiya To Darna Kya'
 ye donon hi super hit raheen
 Karan Johar made his directorial debut with 'kuch Kuch Hota'
 film menkajol-shahrukh kii jodithi, lekinsalmaan khanek ahm bhoomika main the jo kaajol se ekatarfa pyaar karte the
 It was the biggest hit of 1998
 isi saal hi kaajol aurasalmaan kii film'pyaar kiya to darana kya'
 Its director was Salman's younger brother Sohail Khan
 ye bhi bahut badi hit rahi lekin iske baad salmaan-kaajol kii jodi kabhi filmi parde par nahin dikhi
 By the way, both were together in 'karan-arjun' but not opposite
 yahaan bhikajolki jodi shahrukh khan ke saath thi or salmaan ke saath unke seen bhi ek yaa do hi the
 Now if the two work together in Dabangg 3, then after 18 years, this pair will be seen together again
 'dabang' ek badi hit brand he or tisare part main utsukata barqaraar rakhane ke liye bhi isamen behtareen casting hogi
 The 'dabangg' feature was Salman Khanathe, whose opposite Sonakshi Sinha was launched
 yah 2010 kii sabase badi hit thi, jisaki kamai lagbhag 215 karod thi
 Abhinav Kashyap was the director of Dabangg
 'dabang 2' kaa nirdesan kiya abhinayta or nirmaataa arbaz khan ne
 Although 'dabangg 2' got the benefit of a successful brand, its business was less compared to 'dabangg'
 isane kareeb 158 karod kaa kaarobaar kiya
 Now as far as Sonakshi Sinha is concerned, her existence is also being told in this film
 ab dekhte hai ki 'dabang 3' kii script kis andaaj kii hogi
