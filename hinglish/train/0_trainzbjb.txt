 For the past few days in Delhi, the battle between the Central Government vs
 Delhi Government on the issue of VAT Commissioner has come to an end
 alji najeeb jang ne iees afasar es es yadav ko dilli kaa nayaa waite kamishnar niyukt kiya he
 Yadav was currently the CEO of Delhi Jal Board and is considered to be very special to Kejriwal
 asal main kuch dinon pehle waite kamishnar iees afasar vijay kumaar kaa transafar dilli se baahar kar diya gaya tha jiske baad kejariwal sarkaar ne alji or centre sarkaar ke khilaaf rasukhdaar tryder lobby or hawala kaarobaariyon ke dabaav main kaam karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Not only this, when the Kejriwal government put forward the name of IAS officer Ankur Garg for the new VAT commissioner, the LG turned down saying that he is too junior for this post
 iske baad kejariwal sarkaar ne cabinet prastaav paas karke kaha ki agar alji 24000 karod ke waite collection ke lakshya ko puraa kar sakate hai to waite vibhaag apane paas hi rakh len
 After this, LG issued a press clarification that they did not transfer any
 grih mantralay kaa aadesh tha ki jo afasar maheenon pehle transafar ho chuke hai, unako relive kiya jaae
 And, because the government was not accepting the orders of the Home Ministry, the Home Ministry had to direct the LG office to release the officers whose LG office issued the order
 tippaniyan Actually 70 percent of the total revenue of the Delhi government comes from VAT i
e
 for whatever promises Kejriwal made to the people of Delhi in the election, the money is mainly to come from VAT
 isliye aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne waite collection kaa lakshya 17 hazaar karod se badhaakar 24 hazaar karod karne kaa faisla kiya he 
 In such a situation, it is not tolerable to tamper with this department
 kul milakar kejariwal ke khaas or pasandida maane jane vaale afasar es es yadav kii waite kamishnar ke taur par niyukti se mana jaae ki kam se kam ye morcha to kejariwal ne fateh kiya jisase department par u kii pakad barqaraar he
 In fact, a few days ago, the transfer of VAT commissioner IAS officer Vijay Kumar was removed from Delhi, after which the Kejriwal government accused the LG and the central government of working under pressure from the influential traders lobby and hawala traders
 yahi nahin jab kejariwal sarkaar ne nae waite kamishnar ke liye iees afasar ankur garg kaa naam aage badhaayaa to alji ne ye kah kar thukraa diya ki is pad ke liye ye bahut junior hai
 After this, the Kejriwal government passed the cabinet proposal and said that if LG can meet the VAT collection target of 24000 crore, then keep the VAT department with you
 iske baad alji ne press jari karke safai di ki unhone kisi kaa koi transafar nahin kiya he
 The order of the Ministry of Home Affairs was that officers who had been transferred months ago should be relieved
 or, kyonki sarkaar grih mantralay ke aadesh nahin maan rahi thi isliye un afasaron ko relive karne ke liye grih mantralay ko alji daftar ko nirdesh dena padaa jiske alji daftar ne aadesh jari kiya
 The comments asal main dilli sarkaar kii kul kamai kaa 70 fisadi waite se aata he yani chunaav main jo bhi vaade kejariwal ne dilli kii janata se kiye the uske liye mukhyatah paisa waite se hi aana he
 Therefore, the Aam Aadmi Party government has decided to increase the VAT collection target from 17 thousand crores to 24 thousand crores
 aise main is department se zaraa bhi chhedchhad usko bardaasht nahin
 Overall, the appointment of Kejriwal's special and favorite officer SS Yadav as the VAT commissioner is to be believed that at least this front was carried out by Kejriwal, who is holding onto the department

 He said that Mohan Bhagwat's statement on reservation gave the BJP a "setback"
 ek baar ko shah chaunke, phir saamaanya ho gaye
 It seemed that all the workers present in the room were already ready to discuss it
 ve sabhi aarakshan kii samiksha kii baat kehane vaale sarasanghachaalak kii samaj par sawaal khadaa kar rahe the jabaki yah baat aam he ki daliton ke alaava bhi rajya ke bade tabake aarakshan ke labhaarthi rahe hai
 Shah and his team tried to find an alternative method in panic, the result of which was evident in the speeches of Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he announced to protect the reservation at all costs
 yah ranneeti kargar ho paati, usase pehle hi rajya kii 243 vidhansabha siton main se ek-tihaai yani 81 siton par matdaan ho chukaa tha
 By now it was too late

 Modi's ally in the Lok Sabha elections and now Mahagathbandhan electoral strategist Prashant Kishore and his team without delay delayed Bhagwat's call to whatsapp through more than 2 million messages
 uske alaava fasebuk va anya soshal media manchon par bhi in sandeshon kii baadh aa gai
 There are 60 million mobile phones in the state, which is equal to the number of voters in the state
 mahagathbandhan ne iske saath lakhon parache bhi chaape
 Says a RJD leader, "wherever Lalu Prasad went to address the meetings, we distributed among hundreds of people who had Bhagwat's commentary written on them
 hamen ummid thi ki iskaa bijepi ke liye ulataa asar hoga
 "bjp's election campaign has stalled here
 use andaja hi nahin tha ki bihar main chijen kaise kaam karti hai
 Instead, they kept campaigning about the minor things about how Lalu, Nitish and Rahul Gandhi are not coming on one platform
 pichhali garmiyon main loksabhaa chunaav main hasil baari jeet se shaayad shah or unki team itane bharose main thi ki vah is baat ko pakad nahin pai ki khel ab uske haath se phisal rahaa he
 The hasty changes made in the strategy, such as Modi being from a backward caste, failed to make up for the loss
 haalanki sthaneey netaaon ko shaayad andaja ho gaya tha ki faisle ke din 8 november ko kya manjar saamne aane vaala he, tabhi usase ek din pehle bihar bijepi ke ek bade netaa ne hataasha main bhagwat kii tippanee ko “apane hi paale main daaga gaya aisa gol” qaraar diya jise palat paanaa asambhav tha
 Rising religious issues Shah's restlessness could be clearly seen during the first campaign on November 1, the fourth phase of the vote
 na sirf shah balki khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bijepi ke prachaar ko is ummid main sampradayik rang de daalaa ki shaayad ve uttar pradesh ke mujffarnagar kii li ko yahaan doharaa sakenge
 That is why when Modi accused Nitish of snatching quota from backward castes to "a special community" in Buxar on 26 October, no one, including the people present at the rally, had the slightest doubt that his gesture was towards Muslims Is on the side
 bihar-nepal seemaa par sthit raksol main 30 aktubar ko ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue shah ne bhi sampradayik card khel diya
 He warned the people that if the BJP loses the election, "firecrackers will be fired in Pakistan
" ” bhagava sanghathanon ke lagaataar prachaar ke daur main aae is bayaan ne na sirf 17 fisadi muslim votbank ko majbootee se mahagathbandhan ke saath khadaa kar diya balki isane kai duusare tabakon ko bhi naaraaz kar diya ki aakhir bijepi maahaul kaa dhruvikaran karne kii koshish kyon kar rahi he
 Arun Shourie, former BJP leader and minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's cabinet, says that this strategy was outdated
 unhone india today ko bataaya, “yah baat unhen saaf honi chahie thi ki aap ek hi goli ko do baar nahin daag sakate
 Two hours after the fake censorship began, RSS and BJP workers across the country received an SMS from a union official in Rajasthan
 usamen modi or shah ke liye bihar ke janadesh se lene vaale “sabak” kaa hawala diya gaya he, ki “raajnneeti ek team kaary he”, “akele captain ke bal par nahin jeeta ja saktaa” or yah bhi ki “janata ko nakchadha netaa pasand nahin aata
 "this feeling may deepen in the coming days, but various people within the Sangh Parivar believe that the election campaign led by Shah was unnecessarily aggressive and Modi continued to target Nitish, leading to Increased sympathy for the JD (U) and its chief
 nitish ke bihari diene ke bare main modi ke uthaae sawaal kaa bhi ulataa asar hua
 Prashant Kishore made him a part of his campaign
 hajaaron bihariyon se kaha gaya ki ve dilli ke pradhanmantri karyaalay ko apane bal or nakhun kaa namoona bhejein
 Every sender urged Modi to get his DNA checked
 iske alaava bihar ko “bimaaru rajya” kah kar modi ne yah kehane kaa koi bhi mauka haath se ganvaa diya ki bihar main hua vikaas darasal jedy(you) ke saath uske purvavarti gathbandhan kii dein tha, jiskaa shrey bijepi ko bhi milanaa chahie
 The bjp's situation deteriorated further when Lalu made Beef a part of the election campaign and brought Modi's silence to a standstill in Dadri over the alleged killing of a Muslim in the name of eating beef
 bijepi ke taabut main aakhri keel antim charan ke matdaan se ek din pehle 4 november ko thok di gai jab chunaav ayog ne bijepi ke un vigyapanon ko pratibandhit kar diya jisamen party ne is ummid main gaayon ko kaate jane ke sambandh main nitish kii chuppi par sawaal uthaaya tha ki isse hindu votaron kaa dhruvikaran mahagathbandhan ke khilaaf kiya ja sakegaa
 As the modi-shah team made these mistakes, Prashant Kishore and his team managed to cash in on the benefits of the grand alliance by giving each issue a dramatic twist
 diene vaali tippanee se khilne ke baad prashanth kishor ne lalu kii beti misa par modi kii tippanee ko mudda bana diya, jinhone patna ke kareeb 25 aktubar kii ek raily main misa ko “bechaari beti” kaha tha (loksabhaa chunaav main modi kii lahar ke bich misa kii haar ke sandarbh main)
 The message that Prashant Kishore circulated was quite clear: Modi is anti-women
 iske baad pradhanmantri or anya netaaon ne jab jangalraj kaa hallaa machaana shuru kiya&jo lalu ke raaj ke bare main sanyog se nitish kaa gadha hua shabd tha jab ve donon siyaasi virdohi hua karte the&to argedy pramukh ke paas iskaa bana-banaaya jawaab taiyaar tharu “jangalraj nahin, ham mandalraj waapas laaenge
 "after this defeat, many leaders of Bihar BJP in private conversation acknowledge that Modi had hurt Bihari Asmita long before the election campaign was formally started

 On November 9, a day after the election results, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley admitted that the BJP missed the electoral calculus

 We thought that the development agenda and the impact of Prime Minister Modi on the lines of the Lok Sabha elections would be overshadowed by this mathematics and would create a new chemistry, while this did not happen
 ”jetali ne yah bhi sweekaar kiya ki apane-apane kshetron main gathbandhan ke pratyaashiyon ko apane jati aadhaarit samarthakon se vot dilwane main apane teenon sahyogiyon kii kshamta kaa bhi bijepi ne galat akalan kar liya tha
 He said, "there was a huge crowd at the rallies of the Prime Minister but the statements of some party leaders distracted us from our core development issue and our message did not reach the people in the right context
" ”asal maamla yah he ki tikat bantwaare ke samay se hi party akele vikaas ke bharose nahin thi
 Amit Shah was walking on two boats: with the message of Modi's development, every candidate's caste was thoroughly examined
 bijepi jin 160 siton par ladi, un par 64 pratyaashee agadi jatiyon ke the (mote taur par brahman, bhoomihaar, rajput or kysth) or 22 yadav the
 BJP kept the task of mobilizing upper castes while in the case of backward, extremely backward castes and Dalits, it relied on Paswan, Manjhi and Kushwaha
 ve na sirf is kaam main maat kha gaye, balki yadavon main yuva aabaadi ko jodgaye kii koshish bhi naakaam rahi
 The result of this and negative publicity was that the votes of some BJP supporters were also shattered and the upper caste dominated areas also left
 bihari banaam bahriyah baat sunne main atpati lag sakati he lekin ek prachaarak ke rup main modi par jarurat se zyada bharosa karke bhi bijepi ne apana nuksaan kar liya
 This simply meant bypassing local leaders

 tendulkar naabad 71 ran banaakar khel rahe hai jisase bharat ne kharaab shuruyaat se ubarkar duusare din kaa khel khatm hone tak apni pehali pari main teen wicket par 182 ran banaaye
 Earlier, with the help of captain Michael Clarke's 130, Australia managed to reach 380 runs in their first innings
 bharat ke liye of spinner ravichandran aswin ne apane kariyar kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan karte hue 103 ran dekar saat wicket liye
 In response, India did not start well
 murali vijay (10) or virendra sahvaag (2) ke pavilion lautne se score do wicket par 12 ran ho gaya
 Tendulkar took the position with an unbroken partnership of 93 for the third wicket with Cheteshwar Pujara (44) and then a 77-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Virat Kohli (50 not out)
 patinson ne ab tak chah over main 25 ran dekar teen wicket liye hai
 Vijay and Sehwag were bowled by Pattinson
 is tej gendbaaj ne duusare satr main keval teen over kiye or 16 ran dekar dekar do wicket liye
 Vijay was the first batsman to be dismissed
 vah patinson kii teji ko nahin bhaanp paye or phullength gend ko drive karne ke prayaas main apane viketon par khel gayi
 Sehwag also immediately returned to the pavilion
 vah haalanki ajeebogareeb tareeke se bold hue
 He played Pattinson's ball defensively, which bounced from within the crease after being hit from the ground and fell from the top to the leg stump
 patinson ko tisare satr main phir se teen over ke liye gend saunpi gayi or unhone pujaara ko bold karke bharat ko teesraa jhatka diya
 Pattinson's 140-km ball kept Pujara's middle stump uprooted while staying down

 unhone apni pari ke dauraan bhartiya sarajameen par 7000 ran bhi puure kiye
 He became the second batsman after Ricky Ponting to score 7000 runs at home

 isse pehle australia ne subah saat wicket par 316 ran se aage khelte hue 38 over tak bhartiya gendbaajon kaa saamana kiya or is bich 64 ran jode
 However, some decisions again went in his favor, leaving India disappointed

 Apart from Ashwin, Ravinder Jadeja took two wickets for 71 from India while Harbhajan Singh also managed to take one wicket in his 100th Test match
 clark or peter sidle (19) ne lagbhag dedh ghante tak wicket nahin girane diya
 Clarke then wanted to send Jadeja over his head for six runs, but he took the edge of the bat and waved it in the air and was caught by Bhuvneshwar Kumar at long off
 clark ne apni pari main 246 gendon kaa saamana kiya tathaa 13 chauke or ek chakka lagaaya
 He shared a 54-run partnership for the eighth wicket with Siddle
 iske turant baad harbhajan singh kaa wicket kaa lanbaa intjaar khatm hua
 The off-spinner got Siddal caught at slip by Virender Sehwag on the last ball of his 24th over
 sidle ne 94 gend khelkar apane captain kaa acha saath diya
 lbw's credible appeal was rejected by umpire Kumar Dharmasena against Pattinson (15 not out) in Harbhajan's next over

 This time PM is going to do yoga on World Yoga Day in Ranchi
 isko lekar jharkhand sarkaar ne bataaya 'jharkhand ke mukhyamantri raghubar das ne somvaar ko kendriya aayush sachiv rajesh cotecha, rajya ke mukhya sachiv di

 The main event is being organized on World Yoga Day from the year 2015 through the Government of India

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been participating in its main event
 pichley saal iskaa aayojan uttarakhand ke dehradun main hua tha

 The Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman election is to be held at 11 am on Thursday
 endie or upie ke bich is pad ko lekar kadaa muqabla hone kii ummid he
 Both sides are far from the majority's magical figure
 aise main ucch sadan ke upasabhapati ke pad par jeet tay karne main aise raajnneetik dalon kii ahm bhoomika hogi, jo philhal kisi bhi gathbandhan ke saath nahin hai
 That is why the NDA is taking care of its clan as well as making a dent in the opposition
 vahiin upie vipaksh ke sabhi dalon ko saadhane kii kavayad main juta he
 While JDU MP Harivansh Singh is in the fray as an NDA candidate, the BK Hariprasad candidate of the Congress has filed his nomination for the opposition
 jabaki pehle ensipi kii vandana chavaan kaa naam chal rahaa tha, lekin aakhri din congress ne apane pattey khole hai
 Let us know that the tenure of the recently retired Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien ended in last month i
e
 July
 245 sadasyeey rajyasabha main abhi 244 sadsy hai or 1 seat khaali he
 In the current 244-member Upper House, 123 votes would be required to win the Deputy Speaker election
 aise main endie or upie donon paksh bahumat ke aankade se dur hai
 The AIADMK, Biju Janata Dal, TRS, Aam Aadmi Party and PDP as well as Independent mps will play the most important role in deciding the victory of the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha
 donon paksh in dalon se samarthan hasil karne ke liye haath paanv maar rahe hai
 There are 13 members of AIADMK, 9 of Biju Janata Dal, 1 of Indian National Lok Dal, 2 of PDP, 6 of TRS, 2 of VISR Congress and 3 of Aam Aadmi Party
 avishvaas prastaav ke dauraan bijedy or tiares sadan se anupasthit rahe the
 In such a situation, the question arises whether these two parties will remain out of the house even during the voting of the Deputy Chairman
 The ruling NDA has 99 mps in the Rajya Sabha
 isamembijapi ke 73, shivasena ke 3, bodo pipuls front ke paas 1, jediu ke 6, arpiai (e) ke 1, shiromani akali dal ke 3, sikkim democratic front ke 1, namankit sadsy 4 saansad or nirdaleey 6 sadsy shaamil hai
 The strength of the opposition is more than that of the ruling party
 sanyukt vipaksh ke saansadon kaa aankada 109 he
 This included 50 of Congress, 4 of BSP, 13 of TMC, 2 of CPI, 5 of CPM, 4 of DMK, 1 of Indian Muslim League, 1 of JDS, 1 of Kerala Congress, 4 of NCP, 5 of RJD, of SP
 13, TDP consists of 6 mps
 vipaksh ke dwaara modi sarkaar ke khilaaf laae gaye avishvaas prastaav ke dauraan ediemke ne endie kaa saath diya tha
 Because of this it can be expected that she can also support the NDA in the election of the Deputy Chairman
 ediemke ko jodne ke baad bhi endie kaa aankada 112 pahunch jaataa he
 However, the AIADMK is yet to clear the picture
 raashtrapati ke chunaav membijedy ne endie ummidavaarramnath kovind ko samarthan kiya tha
 Opposition candidate Gopal Krishna was with Gandhi in the election of Vice President
 jabaki avishvaas prastaav ke dauraan bijedy sadan se baahar rahi thi
 Although the BJP is busy making its inroads in Odisha, it seems difficult to break the bjd's support
 haalanki, sutron kii maane to mangalvaar ko gulam nabi aaazaad ne naveen patnayak se samarthan ke liye kol kiya tha
 But Patnaik has already agreed to support JDU with Nitish Kumar over phone
 is tarah se bijedy ke samarthan karti he to endie kaa aankada 121 pahunchataa he
 The TRS has 6 mps
 vipaksh kii ore se congress ke ummidavaar ke utarane se tiares ke saath ye mushkil khadi ho gai he, kyonki telugana main congress or tiares aamane-saamne hai
 In such a situation, TRS can support NDA
 jabaki aam aadmi party or pidipi kaa endie kaa saath janaa mushkil hai
 These two parties can live with the opposition

" ’ In Uttar Pradesh, the BJP is making all efforts to repeat the results of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in 2019
 isi kadi main ab bijepisapake mul votbank yadav samudaay ke dil main jagah banane ke liye betaab he
 On the other hand, political swords have been drawn between Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav
 aise main bijepi 15 sitambar kolkhanumen 'yadav sammelan' karne ja rahi he
 The Yadav Mahasabha will not prevent its members from attending the BJP convention
 uttar pradesh main obisi samudaay main sabase badi sankhya yadav samudaay kii he
 The state has around 8 per cent Yadav voters and backward castes account for about 20 per cent
 pichley teen dashak seupika yadav matadaata sapa ke saath majbootee ke saath judaa hua he
 The BJP has specifically asked its party workers and office bearers from the Yadav community to attend the conference
 booth level se lekar pradesh str tak ke yadav jati ke kaaryakartaaon ko zyada se zyada lakhanu ke is sammelan main shaamil karaane kaa bidaa saunpa he
 National President of Yadav Mahasabha Uday Pratap Singh Yadav said that people of all political parties are included in our organization
 aise main ham yadav samaaj ko is kaarykram main jane se nahin rokenge
 He said that in UP, Yadav voters are with SP and in Bihar they are with RJD, but in other states they vote for other parties
 aise main bijepi bhi koshish kar rahi he
 Although Uday Pratap is associated with SP
 akhilesh yadav ne apni sarkaar main inhen uttar pradesh hindi santhaan kaa adhyaksh banaaya tha
 Not only this, Mulayam Singh is also a teacher of Yadav, as a result of this, SP also sent him to Rajya Sabha in 2002
 ab jab upi main sapa apane raajnneetik vajood bachaae rakhane ke liye sangharsh kar rahi he
 In such a situation, this conference of BJP is considered very important
 yadav mahasabha se jude rahe anuraag yadav ne ajtak se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki upi ke badale hue sameekaran ke lihaaj se bijepi yadav sammelan kar rahi he, lekin isamen use kamyaabi mili ye kahana mushkil he
 However, in recent times the BJP has pushed forward many leaders of the Yadav community
 unhone kaha ki shivpal yadav ne akhilesh yadav se alag hokar samaajawaadee secular morcha bana liya he
 In such a situation, those who were angry and running side lines from SP will have a strong whereabouts
 yadav samudaay do dhadon main bata hua he
 a section that is young and rich in household, has nothing to do with social justice and Yadav interests
 ve akhilesh yadav ke saath hai
 While the other section is those who have seen the struggle of Yadav society and social justice
 ve sabhi shivpal ke saath hai
 Anurag says that there is a big ideological difference between Akhilesh and Shivpal
 akhilesh yadav parashuram kii jayanti manaate hai, lekin beepi mandal kii jayanti nahin manaate hai
 Questions are being raised on the issue of reservation, but Akhilesh is silent
 jabaki shivpal in saare muddon par mukhar rahete hai
 In such a situation, Shivpal can cause a lot of trouble in the coming time
 aise main shivpal ke aage kii ranneeti par bahut kuch nirbhar karegaa
 Senior Lucknow-based journalist Kashi Yadav says that the BJP is holding a Yadav conference to take advantage of the SP scattering, but it is not going to get much success
 yadav samudaay raajnneetik rup se kaaphi jaagruk he
 He considers himself good in the current politics
 bijepi sarkaar ke aane ke baad se jis tarah yadavon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya he wo jagajaahir he
 Significantly, the BJP has taken many big decisions in recent times to connect Yadavs
 eta kshetra ke puraane netaa harnath yadav ko bijepi ne haal hi main rajyasabha bheja he
 Whereas Subhash Yaduvansh, the largest organization of youth in the organization, has been made the president of Bharatiya Janata Party Yuva Morcha
 2017 main jab yogi sarkaar bani to girish yadav ko mantri banaaya gaya
 Apart from this, a Yadav coming from Varanasi region has also been appointed as a member of the Legislative Council
 bijepi kaa maananaa he ki vah kisi jati ko apane se alag nahin kar sakati or vah samagrata main sochati he
 State President of BJP Yuva Morcha, Subhash Yaduvansh says that this is a part of our conference of backward castes
 bijepi kisi jati vishesh kaa sammelan nahin karti, lekin yah sach he ki 15 sitambar ko hamaare yadav or usase milti julati jati ke jo log party ke padon par hai
 He has been invited to this program

 From input language aabaadi ke lihaaj se desh ke sabase bade soobe upi main darasal kitne mukhyamantri hai ye charchaa ek baar phir garm ho gai he
 The reason is the tussle between the most powerful leaders of the party sitting in power
 charchaa he ki siem akhilesh yadav ko apane hi parivaar main varchasv kii ladaai ladani pad rahi he or shaayad yahi vajah he ki samaajawaadee party sarkaar ke itihaas main pehali baar mukhyamantri ne chaar din biit jane ke baavjood ab tak saifai mahotsav kaa rukh nahin kiya he
 Whatever be the circumstances in the state, but in the ancestral village of SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, the Yadav family has been celebrating the Saifai festival with equal pomp every year
 jab ye mauka satta rahete aata he to isaki rangath kuch or hi hoti he
 The glare of big cities and select stars of Bollywood comes down to this small village, and Saifai welcomes the New Year in the same light
 kalakaaron ne bhi siem ke naa aane par kiya sawalis saal 26 disambar ko shuru hue is kaarykram main mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kii gairmaujuudagi charchaa kaa vishay bani hui he
 In the last eighteen years, it has never happened that the important members of the family and the Chief Minister of UP in the Samajwadi Government have not attended the Saifai festival even after four days have passed
 ab to party netaaon ke alaava kalakaar bhi is par sawaal kar rahe hai
 Artist Surbhi Tandon said, 'I have been coming to this festival from the beginning and i am missing the Chief Minister
 mukhyamantri hamaare pehle kai kaaryakramon main rahe hai lekin ab ham unke ghar main kaarykram karne aae hai to unki kami khal rahi he, yah to unka parivaar he lekin ghar main chaar bartan honge to khatka-khatki to hogi hi
 'so this is the reason for resentment? The speculation of resentment behind CM Akhilesh Yadav's absence is adding to this discussion
 isaki sabase badi vajah bataai ja rahi he saifai mahotsav shuru hone se ain pahalokhilesh yadavake do kareebi netaaon anand bhadauria or sunil singh 'saajan' kaa party se baahar nikaala janaa
 In fact, both Bhadoria and Saajan were members of the core team of Akhilesh Yadav, who led the campaign for Akhilesh during the 2012 elections
 akhilesh ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad donon hi netaaon ko unki siem se najdiki kaa inaam bhi mila
 Anand Bhadoria, who was the national president of Lohia Vahini at that time, got a ticket to contest the Lok Sabha elections against Jitin Prasad, while Sunil Singh, who was the national president of Samajwadi Party student body of SP, was given the status of minister by making him the president of a corporation
 Gone
 haalanki beete panchayat chunaavon main party ke khilaaf kaam karne ke iljaam par in donon hi netaaon ko party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya
 Sources reveal that even though CM Akhilesh Yadav was the party's state president, his opinion was not taken in this decision
 aise main upi keraajnneetik halkon menye khabar garm he ki apni naaraazgi dikhaane ke liye siem akhilesh saifai mahotsav nahin pahunche
 Some opposition politicians are calling it a chief minister's rebellion
 bijepi ne kaha- daal main kuch kaala hapradesh bijepi adhyaksh lakshmikant bajpei ne kaha, 'kuch naa kuch daal main kaala to he
 It will also be clear when the time comes
 lekin ye baat thik bhi he, mukhyamantri kaa ksht he ki saifai main mela ho rahaa he or pradesh kii paristhitiyaan anukool nahin he
 The fair could also be postponed
 kharaab kanoon vyavastha he, kisaan mara ja rahaa he or udhar saifai main baar baalaon ke dance main thumake lagen
 This is probably unfair
 'unhone yah bhi kaha ki is naaraazgi kaa kaaran ghar main satta kaa bantwaaraa bhi he
 Three and a half years passed but the CM could not achieve anything
 wo gharavaalon ke hastkshep ke kaaran kuch nahin kar sake
 Now a year and a half is left
 marataa kya na karata isliye mukhyamantri ne vidroh kiya he
 Are you angry with this interference in power? Actually, it is not hidden from anyone that apart from Supremo Mulayam Singh and CM Akhilesh Yadav, there are many power centers in the Samajwadi Party
 inamen khaastaur par siem akhilesh ke chaachaaon ram gopal yadav or shivpal singh kaa naam liya jaataa he
 Since the information about the expulsion of cm's close friends was released through Shivpal Yadav, a minister in the state government, people believe that CM Akhilesh is very upset about his uncle's interference and not taking such decisions
 baharhaal hakeekat kuch bhi ho lekin is charchaa ne upi main vipaksh kii dhar jarur paini kar di he
 BSP leader Swami Prasad Maurya said, 'samajwadi Party has become a victim of conflict

 The Supreme Court today gave a big decision on reservation in government job promotion
 supreme courtne kaha he ki pramotion menaarakshandena jaruri nahin he
 While delivering the verdict, Justice Nariman said that the decision of the Supreme Court in Nagaraj case was correct, so it is not necessary to reconsider it
 yani is maamle ko dobaaraa 7 jajon kii peeth ke paas bhejnaa jaruri nahin he
 While delivering the verdict, the Supreme Court has said that it is clear that data is required according to the Nagraj judgment
 lekin raahat ke taur par rajya ko varg ke pichhadepan or saarvajanik rojgaar main us varg ke pratinidhitiv kii aparyaaptta dikhaane vaala maatraatmak data ekatra karnaa jaruri nahin he
 The Supreme Court has accepted the arguments of the Center and the states on this issue
 supreme court ne kaha he ki aankade jari karne ke baad rajya sarkarein aarakshan par vichaar kar sakati hai
 The Supreme Court, in its judgment, said that the state governments can formulate a policy to give reservation keeping in mind the following factors
 1
 Backwardness determination of classes2
 naukari main unke pratinidhitiv kii aparyaaptta3
 Complying with Article 335 of the Constitution, the court said that the determination of backwardness will be decided on the basis of data collected by the state governments
 bataa den ki nagaraj banaam sangh ke faisle ke anusaar pramotion main aarakshan kii seemaa 50 fisadi se zyada nahin ho sakati
 This limit has been upheld by the Supreme Court
 saath hi court ne yah bhi kaha he ki 'krimi layer' ke siddhant ko sarkari naukariyon kii padonnati main essi-asti aarakshan main lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In fact, in 2006, a 5-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court gave a decision on reservation in promotion in government jobs
 us vakt court ne kuch sharton ke saath is tarah kii vyavastha ko sahi tehraaya tha
 What is M
 Nagaraj's decision? Supreme Court in 2006 case M
 nagaraj ko lekar faisla diya tha
 The court said in its judgment that the concept of 'creamy layer' cannot be applied in SC-ST reservation in promotions of government jobs, as in the earlier two decisions regarding creamy layer in obcs, 1992 versus Indra Sawhney and others
 It was stated in the Central Government (mandal Commission verdict) and the 2005 judgment of EV Chinnaiya v
 Andhra Pradesh
 lekin aarakshan ke liye rajya sarkaron ko maatraatmak data dena hoga
 What was the Centre's argument on Nagraj decision? Actually, before this, the Central Government had told the Supreme Court that the decision in the Nagraj case in 2006 is hindering the reservation of ST / SC employees in promotion
 lihaaja is faisle par phir se vichaar kii zarurat he
 However, even after 12 years, neither the central nor state governments gave these figures
 iske bajaay kai rajya sarkaron ne pramotion main aarakshan ke kanoon paas kiye, lekin supreme court ke aadesh ke chalate ye kanoon radd hote gaye
 SC / ST organizations have announced a big agitation on September 28, demanding reservation in promotion

 This is 1,700 less than the total number of jeans reported recently, while initial estimates put it at 100,000
 adhyayan ke mutabik, in adhikansh jinson ke purvaj 5 karod saal pehle narwanar gana (primet) kii upasthiti ke pehle ke hai
 "I call it the shrinking human genome," said Alfonso Valencia, deputy director of basic research at the Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO)
 protein kaa koding hissaa (protein paidaa karne vaala) nirantar badhata rahaa he
 Till a few years ago, no one could have imagined how these jeans could do such a complex job despite such a small number
 'koun sa genes vastav main protein paidaa karata he jaanane ke liye maanav protein kii maap ke maddenjar shodhakartaaon ne bade paimaane par saat maanav spectrometry adhyayan (maanav ke 50 uttakon) se tathyon ko ekikrut kiya
 As many as 1,700 such genes were known to produce protein, but were not actually found for several reasons
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki yaa to inamen koding se sambandhit koi sanrachana hi nahin thi yaa phir inamen protein koding kii kshamta hi nahin thi
 According to the findings, more than 90 percent of human genes that produce proteins originated at the time of metazoans or multicellular organisms dating back 100 million years
 isse saaf jaahir hota he ki genes or proteins ke str par maanav or primet ke bich antar behad kam he

 lekin bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi kii prashasank, bollywood kii ek khubasurat bala ne jo kiya he, wo hairaan kar dene vaala he
 We are talking about Meghna Patel

 To show support to Modi, Meghna has a nude photoshoot
 meghna ne khud ko keval modi ke ek poster se dhakaa hua he
 Meghna Patel is Gujarati and also a fan of CM Modi of Gujarat

 iske alaava unhone bhojpuri filmon main bhi kaam kiya he
 Meghna has also worked in the TV serial 'kahani Chandrakanta Ki'
 narendra modi ke samarthan main kai bollywood hasinaayen bol chuki hai
 Earlier, Mallika Sherawat had praised Modi
 lekin meghna ne modi ke liye jo kiya he, vah nayaa he
 It can also be called publicity stunt
 haalanki is par narendra modi kaa kya riection hoga, kaha nahin ja saktaa
 We await their response
 sajid khan kii aagaamee film 'hamashakals' main kaam kar rahi bollywood abhinetriyon tamanna or isha gupta kaa kahana he ki ve sex kamedi vaali filmon main khud ko sahaj mahasoos nahin karatin
 Isha, who played bold characters in 'jannat 2' and 'raj 3', does not feel comfortable in a sex comedy or adult comedy
 isha ne pitiai se kaha, main sex kamedi nahin karuungi, kyonki mujhe yah samaj nahin aati
 When i did 'jannat 2' and 'raj 3', people used to tell me that it is bold, but we did not make fun of this 'bold' or 'sex' word
 hamane ise ek kala ke rup main pesh kiya
 Isha said, i wonder how people make jokes about sex
 'grand masti' jaisi kai filmon ne acchhee kamai kii
 There is a market for this and that is fine
 lekin main sex kamedi kaa hissaa hokar sahaj mahasoos nahin karuungi
 Expressing similar sentiments, Tamannaah, Isha's partner in Humshakals, also said that she will not do this (sex comedy)
 tamanna ne kaha, main filmein apane parivaar ke saath dekhati hum
 So i don't want to do anything that i don't feel comfortable doing
 sex kamedi filmon ke liye ek bazaar he
 
 
 a segment of the audience likes these types of films
 mujhe romantic-kamedi, kamedi or bhaavnaatmak filmein dekhnaa or karnaa pasand he
 Bipasha Basu and Esha Gupta, who play the lead characters in the film Humshakals, will be seen in Bikini, while Tamannaah is not ready to wear it
 tamanna ne kaha, maine film main shorts pahani hai, bikini nahin
 i have made a rule not to wear bikini and not to give kissing scenes on screen
 main is par kaayam rahuungi
 i will not do anything that i am not comfortable with
 ab aisa lagane laga he ki congress kii sahyogi partiyon ko use dhamkaane kaa chaska lag chukaa he or apni isi aadat ke kaaran unhone upie sarkaar ke liye khatre kii ghanti baja di he
 On October 10, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati announced in Lucknow that she would soon decide how long the party would continue to support the central government from outside
 unhone kaha, ‘‘soch-vichaar karne ke baad main jald hi aapako sab kuch bataa duungi
 "mayawati is not the only one preparing for the election ahead of time
" usee din nesanalist congress party (ensipi) ke adhyaksh sharad pavaar ne bhi apni party se samay-purv chunaav ke liye taiyaar rahane ko kaha
 Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Mulayam Singh Yadav has also said the same thing on behalf of his party recently
 yadi upie-2 ko bispi ke 21 saansadon kaa samarthan milanaa band ho jaae to khud ko bachaae rakhane ke liye vah puri tarah se sapa ke 22 saansadon par hi nirbhar ho jayega
 Addressing the NCP conference in Vadodara, Sharad Pawar said that the party will contest the Gujarat assembly elections with the Congress but will demand more than eight seats in the 2007 assembly elections in the seat sharing
 mayawati ne sitambar main dijal kii keemton main vruddhi, alpiji silendaron kii adhiktam sankhya tay karne or multi brands retail main pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadi) kii manjuuri dene jaise sarkaar ke kadamon par apni pratikriya ko 9 aktubar ko lakhanu main hone vaali party kii sankalp raily tak ke liye taal diya tha
 In a rally organized at the Ramabai venue in Lucknow, BSP President Mayawati said, "it seems as if the Lok Sabha elections will be held before time
" ’’ unhone party kaaryakartaaon se upie kii ‘garib virdohi’ nitiyon ke khilaaf sangharsh karne or samay-purv chunaavon ke liye taiyaar rahane kaa aahvaan kiya, alabatta unhone sanket die ki ‘‘kisaanon or garib janata ke hit main sakaaratmak nattejey aane par bispi epadi’’ ko gale bhi laga sakati he
 It is a relief for the Congress that Mayawati wants to wait for increasing anti-incumbency against Akhilesh Yadav's government in Uttar Pradesh
 purv mukhyamantri is samay kaa upyog apane cader ko taiyaar karne ke liye kar rahi hai
 According to party sources, she has already named the former DIG (stamp) and BSP zonal coordinator Ram Lakhan Pasi to fight against Sonia Gandhi from Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency
 party ne is par bhi abhi apane pattey nahin khole hai ki upie ke khilaaf trinmul congress netaa mamata banerjee ke avishvaas prastaav laane par ve uskaa samarthan karengi yaa nahin
 BSP national general secretary Satish Mishra says this much, "mayawati has a lot of time to take a final decision because the parliament session is not in the recent past
" ’’party sansthaapak kanshiram kii punyatithi par yojit sankalp raily rajya vidhansabha chunaav main party kii haar ke baad mayawati kii pehali raily thi
 Saffron color in the blue color of BSP was also seen in the crowd of more than five lakhs
 vahaan maujuud 10,000 brahman ‘jai shriram’ likhe hue bhagava gamche liye hue the
 Nasimuddin Siddiqui's slogan 'brahmin conch will play, elephant grows up' made the bsp's efforts to woo the upper castes more clear
 mayawati ne bhi ek nayaa naaraa uchhaala, ‘panja, phool, cycle, teenon ek rang main range hue, 2014 main milenge hathi kii sound par chadhe hue
 'hopefully, Congress will have got the message

 On Tuesday, 76 personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force were killed in the most destructive attack of the Naxalites
 mangalvaar ko chhattisgarh ke dantewada jile ke mukarana ke jangalon main naksaliyon javaanon par hamalaa kiya
 It is believed that 76 CRPF jawans got trapped in a trap laid by Naxalites
 naksaliyon kaa hamalaa subah chah se saat baje ke bich hua
 The victims of the attack were 82, including 80 CRPF personnel and two local policemen
 ye jawan sanyukt abhiyaan ke tahat base camp kii ore laut rahe the ki usee samay un par naksaliyon ne hamalaa bol diya
 In this attack, a CRPF company was eliminated in a way
 hamale main up commander satyawan singh yadav tathaa sahaayak commandent bi el meena or chhattisgarh police ke head consteble samet 76 log maare gaye
 The attack shook the center and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had to hold a meeting with Home Minister p Chidambaram to assess the situation
 donon ne hamale par aashcharyamishrit sadame kaa izhaar kiya or javaanon ke maare jane par shok jataayaa
 The Prime Minister called it a 'horrific' incident
 chidambaram itani badi sankhya main javaanon ke maare jane se behad dukhi the or unhone kaha ki sanyukt abhiyaan main jarur koi ‘bahut badi galati’ hui he kyonki aisa lagata he ki jawan naksaliyon ke jaal main ja fanse
 Present during the meeting, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj also praised Bilakis Bano and Edhi Foundation for their love and affection for Geeta
 rajdroh kanoon kaa dayera kya he or kin paristhitiyon main ise lagu kiya ja saktaa he, is par vidhi ayog kii report grih mantralay ko milani baaki he
 At the same time, the statistics of three years of the tenure of the Modi government show that the rate of blaming the accused of treason has been very low
 kendriya grih mantralay kii ore se sansad ko uplabdh karaae gaye aankadon ke mutabik varsh 2014 se 2016 ke bich desh main 179 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya jinamein se sirf 2 par hi dosha sabit kiya ja sakaa
 It is clear from the data that the state police failed to prove the blame against the accused
 2014 se 2016 ke bich jin do aropiyon par rajdroh ke aarope sabit hue unamem se ek jharkhand main 2014 main rajya police kii ore se kiya gaya
 Similarly the police in Andhra Pradesh managed to prove treason charge on one accused in 2016
 deshadroh kanoon ko lekar 2016 menjawahar laal nehru uniwarsitimen hue vivaad ko lekar bahut bahes hui thi
 In 2016, in the entire year, only one accused across the country was convicted in treason
 2016 main desh rajdroh ke kul 35 maamle darj hue or inamen 48 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 Chargesheet was filed against 26 and only one accused was proved guilty in Andhra Pradesh
