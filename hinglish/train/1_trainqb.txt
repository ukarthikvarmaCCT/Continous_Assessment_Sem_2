 Born on 11 October 1942 in Allahabad, Amitabh made his film debut in the 1969 film 'saat Hindustani', but his role of a police inspector in the 1973 film 'zanjeer' earned him the title of 'angry Youngman'

 (input: bhashaa) It seems that angry and sad Rabri Devi is fed up with politics, then she says, "politics is a bed of thorns for an ordinary woman like me
 main pehle hi ''sahib'' (lalu prasad yadav) se kah chuki hum ki main bhavishya main chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahati
 i was filled with these elections
 '' india today se ek vishesh saakshaatkaar main rabari ne kaha, ''bhavishya main main sirf party ke liye hi kaam karuungi
 i am not a political person who has a disguise
 mujhe pad paane kii koi laalasaa bhi nahin he
 "A woman whose education did not extend beyond primary school and who married Lalu Prasad Yadav in 1973 at a young age, who was nothing at the time
" yahi nahin, 1997 main raajnneeti main pravesh ke baad to safar or bhi adhik mushkil ho gaya
 But it seems quite difficult to believe now how much Rabri has changed in the meantime
 ab ve pehle jaisi sankochi gruhinee nahin rahi hai balki badi hi aasaani se apni baat kah detii hai or apni raah bhi talash leti hai
 Ramakripal Yadav, a senior RJD leader and head of the party's campaign committee, says, "now Rabri ji is leading the leadership and she speaks fiercely in public meetings
 in dinon jitani bheed laluji gaanvon main juta rahe hai, utani hi bheed rabari ji kii jansabhaon main bhi jute rahi he
 "yadav claims," I am traveling with him
 helicopter ke shor ke bich bhi naaron kii gunj ko suna ja saktaa he
 However, there are still many such things which Rabri Devi could not change
 udhaaharan ke liye, ve ab bhi ek chatur raajnneetik banane se kaaphi dur hai
 Recently, when Lalu tried to pacify Nitish Kumar, who was unhappy with Rabri's personal attack, as his "little brother", she looked completely neutral
 unhone harek se kaha, ''jo sambandh bananaa chaahate hai, banaaen
 "he made it clear, he probably meant that Nitish was just an enemy
" isse zyada or kam kuch nahin
 He did not spare his brother Sadhu, who left RJD to join Congress, "yes, it is sad because" Saheb "gave him everything in politics and now he left us
 haalanki mujhe iskaa koi pachhtaawaa nahin he
 "if we recall his days as Chief Minister, Rabri Devi was the only one to bow down to a photographer and raise her back
" aaj bhi ve prachaar ke dauraan payalat or saath main safar karne waalon ko apni roti or bhindi kii sabji pehle khilaati hai
 Perhaps the real Rabri Devi is the same today

 ’ The largest hospital in the country, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), where the sons reach Gandhi for treatment, where former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Bajpayee goes for treatment

 To the loveliest person i had such a ball shooting # judwaa2 with you!! From Punjabi classes to eating lots of cake!! Here's wishing you an amazeball xxrep 4 s bday @taapsee a post shared by Jacqueline Fernandez (@jacquelinef143) on Jul 31, 2017 at 11:44pm PDT Chhattisgarh state is becoming the head of the case of violence and murder of Naxalites
 11 varsho kii tulanaatmak aankadon se yah baat saamne ai he
 Since 2005, till April 5 this year, 2232 people have lost their lives in the state, including 846 security personnel, 677 civilians and 709 Naxalites
 aankadon kii maane to har do din par naksali hinsa main ek vyakti kii maut (hatya) hoti he
 Naxalism in Chhattisgarh was inherited when a separate Chhattisgarh state was formed in undivided Madhya Pradesh, but due to the government patronage movement like Salwa Judum, there was a further increase in Naxal violence
 naksalwad se nipatane ke liye haalanki punjab ke varisht police afasar capies gil kii bhi sevaayen lee gayi, lekin vaanchit safalataa unhen bhi nahin mil saki
 Due to the Salwa Judum, there was an altercation between the Naxalites and the villagers, and more than 644 villages were vacated and the villagers had to take shelter in the Salwa Judum Camp
 2005 se salwa judum andolan kii sthapana ke baad 300 surakshakarmi sahit 800 se adhik logon kii hatya kaa aarope naksaliyon par laga he
 Thousands of people lived in 23 relief camps
 dhire-dhire salwa judum andolan ne dam tod diya
 Some people from the camp returned to their villages, some migrated to neighboring states, some people are now returning from neighboring states as well
 salwa judum andolan ke chalate hi rajya sarkaar ne special police officer (espeo) kii bhi niyukti kii thi
 Around 4000 youths were recruited at a monthly honorarium of Rs 3000
 farvari 2009 main supreme court ke aadesh par espeo kii niyukti, hathiyaar nahin dene kaa aadesh paarit karne ke baad yah vyavastha samaapt ho gai he
 In 2010, the incident of Maoists killing 76 CRPF personnel in Tadmetla, Chhattisgarh, was seen as the biggest incident by the Naxalites in the history of the country
 vahiin rajanandgaanv ke tatkaaleen police captain vinod kumaar choube kii madanawada (rajanandgaanv) main kuch surakshakarmiyon sahit kii gai hatya bhi badi ghatana thi
 That is, the situation remains the same
 jis kshetra main siarpief ke prashikshan 76 javaanon kii naksaliyon ne gherkar hatya kar di thi, usee ke paas naksaliyon ke surakshit kshetra main estf ke 69 javaanon kii tukdi bhi shanivaar ko naksaliyon se ghir gai or saat jawan shahid ho gaye
 The question arises that on whose orders did a small STF detachment in the Naxalites' safe zone go on a search operation? From 2005 to 12 April 2015, 2232 people have been killed in Naxalites in Chhattisgarh
 is hisaab se ausatan do dinon main ek maut hoti he
 In 11 years, 896 security forces personnel, 667 civilians have died, while the police have claimed to have killed 709 Naxalites
 sarvaadhik maut kaa aankada 2006 main darj he
 There were 361 deaths this year, 350 in 2007, 345 in 2009 and 327 in 2010
 is saal abhi tak 30 logon kii maut hui he, jinamein 17 suraksha bal ke jawan nau naagarik tathaa do naksali bataae jate hai
 In this way, Chhattisgarh remains Sirmour in Naxalite affected states
 11 saalon main naksali hamale main 2232 jharkhand main 1344, andhra pradesh main 712 tathaa odisha main 612 evam maharashtra main 424 logon kii maut ho chuki he

 janaab kaa naam nafis ahamed he
 Was posted as a police officer of UP Police in Hapur
 magar meerut transfar ho gaya, to sochaa jate jate puraane rishton ko aakhri salaam kar jaaen
 Despite being married to the same objective and father of two children, he called his girlfriend to meet him
 mulaakaat kuch is khushgavaar maahaul main hui ki filmon kii rumaniyat bhi bhini pad gai
 Just understand that Nafees saheb did not sing
 varanaa pikchar to puri ban gai thi
 However, he completed his wish by uploading the song on his social media profile, since it was his last meeting before saying goodbye
 lihaaza nafis sahab apni garlfriend kii us zid ko bhi nahin nakaar paae jisamen usne unase asli sarkari pistaul se goli chalaane kii baat kahi
 Just then what pistol was loaded and handed over to Nafees Saheb in the hands of his girlfriend
 ab zaahir he garlfriend to garlfriend hoti he
 Whether it is a celebrity or a Sho
 kar di garlfriend ne pistal ke saath selfi lene auki goli chalaate hue video banane kii zid
 How could i refuse a girlfriend? lihaaza nafis sahab ko bhi ye zid puri kerani padi
 He started explaining to Mehbooba
 isko pakado aise
 Take care so that the video does not stop
 chalaa duun
 Drive it meraa phase bhi to aana chahie
 So don't hold this far? dabaa duun
 Come ruk jaao
 Now the face is coming
 pistal bhi aa rahi he
 Press on tum dabaa sakati hodaba do
 Squeeze
 dabaao jor se
 bring
 aa jaao
 Sit down there
 video cat naa chhodana
 Hey, save it
 or is tarah sarkari pistal se garlfriend ke haathon chali mohabbat kii goli camere main record ho gai
 That too in girlfriend's mobile
 english main is tarah ke video ko ladkiyaan swag kahati hai
 If it is understood in easy language, it is called itrana
 zaahir he insaan khud dekh ke to itaraa nahin saktaa
 Therefore, Nafees Saheb's girlfriend was fickle and she showed it to the people and one of them cleaned her hands on this video and showed it through social media all the time
 bas phir kya the
 This police officer of UP police suddenly became famous
 par badanaami ke saath
 So you heard the story and saw the pictures too
 aaie ab zaraa ishk kii daastaan bhi sunate jaaie
 Who says that the police, police station, court is a useless place
 thane main bhi pyaar punap saktaa he or daroga nafis ahamed ne ye sabit bhi kar diya
 a woman came to the police station against her husband to write to the police at the police station
 ab us pati kaa to pataa nahin par daroga sahab ko uski patni se hi pyaar ho gaya
 Love is also such that the public started firing on the government
 ajeeb ittefaq he
 Ever since Yogi ji's government has come in UP
 tab se upi police kaa antertenment kaaphi bad gaya he
 Sometimes a doctor starts firing from the mouth
 to kabhi koi hathiyaar chalaanaa bhul jaataa he
 So sometimes he shoots his girlfriend
 baharhaal, abhi ye jaananaa zaruri he ki hapur dehaat thane main tainaat rahe sab inspector nafis ahamed ke viral hue is video kii hakeekat kya he
 Why are they firing their girlfriends from a government pistol? or koun he wo ladki jise nafis ahamed kii garlfriend bataaya ja rahaa he
 This is not the only video of Nafees Saheb with this young lady
 balki iske alaava nafis ahamed or is ladki kaa ek video or he
 However, it is not worth showing
 vahiin daroga sahab kii kuch aapattijanak tasviren or chating bhi is yuvati ke saath soshal media par viral hai
 The video we are showing you is shot on a roadside on a deserted area near Hapur during the night
 nafis sahab ke is video ke viral hone ke baad puure police mahakme main hadakamp much gaya he
 In a hurry, the inspector has gone to Meerut via Nafees Relive
 vahiin maamla saamne aate hi espi hapur ne isaki jaanch sio siti se karai
 After which the suspension of Sub Inspector Nafees was recommended
 or diaiji meerut ne unhen suspend bhi kar diya
 After examining the video, it was found that the pistol is official
 magar video main dikh rahi ladki ke saath jo shaks he wo daroga nafis ahamed hai yaa nahin ye philhal saaf nahin he
 So the girl seen in the video is being questioned
 jiske baad hi ye saaf ho paaegaa ki car main yuvati ke saath koun maujuud tha or usne kiski sarkari pistal se fire kiya
 However, when the Facebook profile of Daroga Nafees Ahmed was scrutinized, many surprising things came to light
 pichley saal june main nafis ahamed ne apane fasebuk profile par kai romentic gane or baaten share kin
 Which shows that they are soon friends with the girl seen in the video
 jaanch karne par pataa chalaa ki video main nazar aa rahi eadki shaadishuda he or hapur ke thana dehaat kii rahane vaali he
 The girl seen in the video went to the Nafees police station to file a complaint a few months ago after a dispute with her husband
 jiske baad donon main milanaa julna shuru hua
 It is being told that the two fell in love
 lekin daroga ji pyaar main itane dub gaye ki wo bhul gaye ki wo ek sarkari pad par tainaat hai
 Sub Inspector Nafees Ahmed, forgetting the dignity of his uniform, gave him a government pistol to please his girlfriend
 ganimat rahi ki nafis ahamed kii garlfriend kii firing main koi haadasa nahi hua
 Otherwise, someone would get killed in the love of the inspector
 haalanki hawa main hui is firing ne nafis sahab kii naukari par musiibat to laa hi diya he
 But the question arises that the khaki on which the public is responsible for safety
 agar vahi khaaki apni pistaul dusron ko thamane lage to logon kii suraksha kaa kya hoga

 Tiwari was not only denied the chair of the Leader of the Opposition but also did not find a place in the party's national executive
 raaje se duuri ko lekar sawaal poochne par tiwadi kehete hai, ''shaayad ve saath lenaa nahin chaahatin
 "however, they immediately make it clear that the party cannot run on any one

 com / ghwbnewrz6— ANI (@ani)august 11, 2017 The Maharashtra government has issued a controversial decree
 maharashtra main ab kisi bhi janpratinidhi kii aalochana yaa apmaan karnaa kaaphi mahangaa pad saktaa he
 This will lead to proceedings under Section 124-A of the Indian Penal Code
 maharashtra sarkaar ne police ko nae disha nirdesh jari kar deshadroh se judi ipisi kii dhara lagane ke dauraan kisi tarah kii aspashtataa se bachane ke liye or vidwesh evam ghrinaa ke bina kanoonee tareeke se sarkaar main badlaav laane kii koshish karne vaale logon ke khilaaf ise naa lagane ko kaha
 These guidelines were issued in relation to Section 124-A of the IPC in connection with the assurance given to the Bombay High Court in the case of cartoonist Assem Trivedi
 trivedi ke khilaaf deshadroh kaa maamla hataate hue ucch nyaayalay main yah aashwaasan diya gaya tha
 The Mumbai police arrested Trivedi in 2012 on charges of making a national symbol and a cartoon insulting the Parliament
 atirikt mukhya sachiv (grih) ke pi bakshi ne bataaya ki sarkaar ne ucch nyaayalay ko aashwaasan diya tha ki vah ipisi kii dhara 124-e kii seemaa or maandand ko spasht karte hue ek circular jari karegi
 Accordingly, guidelines were issued on 27 August
 unhone kaha, ipisi kii vibhinn dharaaen lagane kaa adhikaar thana prabharee ke paas hota he
 The government can issue guidelines
 isliye hamane vibhinn police thanon main uljhan kii sthiti se bachane ke liye aisa kiya he
 What is in the circular? According to the circular, there may be a case of treason for commenting against the government and public representatives
 yani kisi meyar, vidhayak, saansad kii aisi aalochana, jissehinsa bhadakne kaa khatraaho to aap par deshadroh lag saktaa he
 Three years ago, Asim Trivedi made some cartoons while standing up to the government and the Maharashtra government arrested him in the case of treason
 lekin baad main deshadroh kaa maamla hataanaa padaa
 However, the government had given assurances regarding issuing guidelines in the court
 lekin aashwaasan ke parde main jo circular jari hua he-usne sidhaa sawaal khadaa kar diya he ki kya sarkaar abhivaykit kii aazaadee ko hi kuchalanaa chaahati he
 The government argues that section-124 cannot be invoked against those who are trying to bring about a change in power in a legal manner without rancor and hatred
 lekin sawaal he ki ye tay koun karegaa
 And the right to impose IPC clauses is with the police, and under pressure from the government to criticize the power, the police will not file a case of treason - who will guarantee it
 manmohan sarkaar kii raah par modi sarkatbhivyakti kii aazaadee par ankush kaa jo aarope manmohan singh ke daur main upie sarkaar par lagata tha, aaj wo narendra modi ke daur main unki hi apni rajya sarkaar par lag rahaa he
 Narendra Modi himself has been an opponent of strangling freedom of press and advocating freedom of expression during the Emergency period
 yani kathghare main bijepi kii rajya sarkaar he to centre sarkaar bhi kyonki is circular se massej yahi ja rahaa he ki bijepi sarkaar ab kisi janpratinidhi kii aalochana sunne ke mood main nahin he or bhale deshadroh kaa maamla darj na kiya jaae lekin kam se kam logon ko daraane ke liye to is dishanirdesh kaa istemaal kiya hi ja saktaa he

 Afghanistan has always been a challenge for Super Powers
 rus ne 1979 main afghanistan par kabja karne kii koshish kii lekin uski fouj ke liye afghanistan maut kaa kuna sabit hua
 Then after the 9–11 attack, the US launched its army to rein in the terrorism that is growing in Afghanistan and Afghanistan has become the second Vietnam for it in the last two decades
 ab nayaa 'super power' ban rahe china kii najar afghanistan par he
 China is trying to get hold of Asia on this route
 kya rus or america kii tarah ab afghanistan main vifal hone kii baari china kii he?sipiisi main shaamil hoga afghanistan?china kii sarkari news agency sinhua ne boaao forum for asia kii ek report ko aadhaar banaate hue afghanistan main china kii entry kaa daawa kiya he
 According to the report, the Chinese government will expand its project in Afghanistan by expanding the scope of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor under its One Belt One Road project
 china sarkaar ko bharosa he ki afghanistan is pariyojna main shaamil hone ke liye taiyaar he
 China's Foreign Minister Wang e has recently made the statement that both China and Pakistan's important neighbor Afghanistan wants to join the China Pakistan Economic Corridor as soon as possible to strengthen its economy
 china sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki yadi afghanistan sipiisi main shaamil hota he to uske liye sipiisi ko central or western iconomic coridor se jodne kaa kaam aasaan ho jayega
 There is no work to add to the occupation of the world: On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping, from the same Boao Forum for Asia forum, said on Tuesday that the voice raised in protest against the ongoing trade dispute with America and its economic expansion policy around the world was free
 The steps taken by China towards global business will work to bind the whole world together
 vahiin china kii aarthik nitiyon ke bachaav main jinping ne daleel di ki china ne apni trade policy ke tahat jin deshon ko entry di he unke liye china kaa rasta kabhi band nahin hoga or aane vaale dinon main is rasta kaa or vistaar kiya jayega
 Afghanistan wants a deal like Pakistan: The current economic relationship between China and Pakistan is trying to lure Afghanistan into CPEC
 pakistan ne china ko 1963 main paak adhikrut kashmir kaa hissaa dene kaa kaam kiya or isse donon deshon kii dosti rang laai
 After this move of Pakistan, the Chinese government continuously worked to help Pakistan's infra development
 yah isi kaa nateeja he ki beete teen saal se pakistan ke aarthik vikaas ke liye china ne 62 billian dollar kii sipiisi pariyojna main nivesh kiya
 Trade war: China can prepare for the third world war, this attack on America too
 Now the Chinese government is preparing to make a place in Afghanistan with the help of infra development in Pakistan
 darasal afghanistan ek landlocd (bina kisi samudri tat ke) desh he jahaan sampradayik kalah or aatankwaad ghar kar chukaa he
 However, due to this communal discord and terrorism, the plans of Russia and America failed here in the decades after 1970
 nateeja yah ki vaishvik niveshkon ke liye afghanistan duniya kii sabase khatarnaak jagahon kii suchi main top par pahunch gaya
 Danger for India is the biggest investor in China Afghanistan
 china ne 2007 main 3 billian dollar kii deal ke tahat afghanistan ke aynak main copper mine ko 30 saal kii lij par liya tha
 It took about 6 months for the copper to be transported from this mine to China, but in 2016, the two countries signed the railway line to prepare the freight corridor and now copper is being transported to China in just two weeks

 Referees can refer to video referees regarding goals, penalties, red cards and identification of an incorrect player using the VAR technique, which will help them

 FIFA will use this technique in all 64 matches

 vars can talk to referees using a 'fiber-based radio system', while 33 broadcasters will feed the camera feed and two offside camera feeds directly to the VORR
 inamen se aath feed super-slo moshan kii hai or chaar ultra-slo moshan kii hai
 At the same time, there will be two additional ultra-slow motion cameras in the knockout matches

 iske liye data mukhya stand par sthit do optical trekking camere se jutaya jayega, jabaki tiimon ke liye chuninda khaas camere bhi lage hai
 At the same time, 5G network will be used in Russia, TMS and Megaphone official communication partners of the World Cup will test this technology during the tournament

 police kii jaanch main pataa chalaa he ki ganesh kii hatya uske hi ek dost ne ek hafte pehle kii thi
 The case is of Mumbai's Virar
 police (mumbai Police)kii shuruaati jaanch main pataa chalaa thaki ganesh kii hatya sirf isliye kii gai kyonki usne aaropee pintu ke ek lakh rupee nahin lautaae the
 Accused Pintu first called Ganesh on the pretext of removing the furniture at home
 iske baad donon ne saath baithkar sharaab pi, isi dauraan donon ke bich kahasuni shuru ho gai
 Only after this, the accused killed Ganesh

 lakhanu ke britland skool main pehali kaksha ke chaatr ko chaaku maarane kii aaropee chaatra ke bare main kai sansanikhej khulaase hue hai
 It is being told that the track record of the accused student has been very poor
 6 maheene pehle vah apane ghar se bhaag gai thi
 Not only this, the vein of his hand has been cut
 isse pehle pariksha ke dauraan copy lekar ghar bhi chali gai thi
 Only a student studying in the seventh grade would carry out such an incident in school, but no one had thought, but her record has been very poor
 usne police ko bataaya bhi ki vah skool main chuttee karana chaahati thi
 So she took the student to the toilet on the pretext of meeting the principal
 vahaan uske munh main kapadaa thunskar use chaakuon se god diya
 After this, he locked the student inside the toilet and exited
 sanyog kahie, usee vakt toilet ke paas ek teacher guzar rahe the
 They heard the victim's voice
 turant darwaja kholaa, to chaatr khun se lathpath padaa hua tha
 The school administration was informed
 iske baad chaatr ko aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya, jahaan usne puri ghatana kii jaankaree di

 maine class main apana bag rakhaa or prere main jane laga
 Then Didi forcefully dragged me to the toilet
 mujhe chaaku maarthe hue vah kah rahi thi ki tum ko jaan se maar duungi
 How will you leave school until you die? 'pehali class ke bachche se us chaatra kii koi dushmani nahin thi
 He did not even know the name of this sister of her school
 phir bhi ek chuttee ke liye didi uske jaan kii dushman ban baithi
 This incident is like a mirror in front of the society, in which the reality of changing color truths is seen
 is ghatana ne ek baar phir se pradhyumna hatyakand kii yaad dilaa di
 In the same way here too, a small class child in the bathroom became a victim of the conspiracy of senior student
 thik usee tarah yahaan bhi skool main bacchon kii suraksha ko lekar gambhir sawaal uthe
 It was just a relief news that the injured student's life was saved and the accused student was also identified within a day
 bachche ne chaatra kii pahchaan sabko bataa di he
 Police investigation and action is in its place after the incident, but such incidents are raising big questions inside the school
 saatvin kii chaatra skool main chaaku lekar kaise chali jaati he? kya bade bacchon ke liye counselling kii koi vyavastha nahin thi? bacchon kii shikaayat or gusse kaa izhaar karne ke liye kya koi doosraa rasta nahin tha?sabase bada sawaal ye he ki skool aane vaale chote bacchon kii nigaraanee main dheel kaise di ja sakati he? ek baccha skool aayaa he or wo class main nahin he to teacher kii kya jimmedaari banati he? pradhyumna hatyakand or lakhanu ke is bade skool kii vaardaat surkhiyon main he
 These incidents are related to big schools, but this question is in front of society and educational institutions
