 ' Two former US presidents Barack Obama and George Bush have expressed concern over the current political situation in the US
 saath hi donon purv raashtrapatiyon ne america main logon se vibhaajan or purvaagrah kii raajnneeti ko khaarij karne kii apil kii he
 This appeal is also seen as a rebuke to US President Donald Trump
 alag-alag jagahon or kaaryakramon main bolte hue obama or bush ne yah chetavanee di ki america ateet kii un nafaraton ke bich pis rahaa he jinhen kaaphi pehle itihaas main dafan ho janaa chahie tha
 He advocated the removal of economic concerns through a common objective
 donon netaaon ne sidhe taur par trump kaa naam nahin liya lekin unki baton se yah saaf tha ki unaaka ishaara america ke raashtrapati trump kii ore he
 According to a New York Times report, Obama, who joined a campaign for the first time since leaving the White House, addressed a rally in New Jersey on Thursday in support of Democrat candidate Murphy for the post of governor
 obama ne kaha ki abhi jo raajnneeti ham dekh rahe hai, hamen lagata tha ki ham use bahut pehle chhod chuke hai
 The person is looking back 50 years
 yah 21veen sadi he, 19veen nahin
 We reject the politics of division and fear

 According to Bush, fanaticism is being fanned in American society
 unhone kaha ki hamaari raajnneeti sajeesh kii kahaniyon or juthi baton kaa shikaar ho rahi he
 Bush said that there are signs, especially among the youth, that it shows that the deep sense of democracy has weakened and the tone of our dialogue has declined
 neuyark times kii khabar ke mutabik trump or bush donon kii soch ek duusare se alag he
 While Trump advocates protectionism against trade and prevents new outsiders from coming in, Bush speaks in favor of immigrants and advocates free trade
 saath hi, rashtrawaad or pakshpaat kii maujuuda niti kii aalochana karte hai
 According to Bush, it seems that the force that connects us has weakened and the force to break has become stronger
 ham apni vah vividhta or gatishiltaa bhul chuke hai, jo pravasi apane saath laate the
 Our nationalism has been limited to being indigenous
 unhone kaha ki mukt bazaar or antarrashtriya vyapaar main jo hamaara vishwaas tha, vah kamjor hone laga he
 We have been inspired by the sentiments that remain isolated from the world, and have forgotten that the security of America is threatened by the chaos and frustration spread elsewhere

 Akshay Sthalekar of the Indian Paranormal Team claims that he has been investigating paranormal events for the last 8 years
 sthalekar kii team pune or lonavala main niyamit taur par 'ghost walk' kaa aayojan karti he
 The purpose of this walk is to capture some spirits or acts of ghosts in the camera by circling the night of such haunted places daily
 mumbai ke sudur ilaake main sthit lonavala monsoon or sardiyon main couples ke liye to swarg to he hi lekin isse bhoot-preton kii khaufnak kahaniyon se bhi gaharaa naata rahaa he
 During one such 'ghost walk' in the hills of Lonavala, Sthalekar saw something which was out of any kind of scientific interpretation
 sthalekar jab apni team ke saath round par the tabhi unki car par do baar teji se nock hua or usee ke baad unki car achaanak se hill gai
 It was a midnight night
 raat main hawa chal rahi thi
 4 people from Sthalekar and his team were traveling in a small car and got out of the car to smoke cigarettes
 team usee jagah par thi jahaan par din main kaaphi log ghoomane aate hai
 Sthalekar says, the wind was blowing west from the east, when suddenly an empty bottle of liquor rose up from the ground at a speed opposite to the direction of the wind
 unki team ko laga ki kuch aprakritik yaa paranormal activity ho rahi he
 By this time, Sthalekar and his friends got inside the car
 jald hi unki car ke shishe par do baar teji se nock kii aawaaj sunai di jabaki vahaan par koi nahin tha
 Then the car suddenly moved so fast as if there was no tin biscuit
 ham log baith gaye or apni divison ko jaldi se on kar liya jo atmaaon ke hone kaa sanket detii hai
 The machines were blinking continuously
 is team ke daawey ke mutabik, unhone ek ap kaa bhi istemaal bhi kiya jise americanyon ne viksit kiya tha
 Voice records of paranormal activities are also recorded through this app
 sthelkar ne bataaya tha, is recorder main marathi main bolti hui ek mahila kii aawaaj aa rahi thi lekin yah aawaaj bahut hi raf or kharaab thi
 Sthalekar said that he wanted to ask her some more questions, does she want to get liberated but then she disappeared

 But no, he retained the rapist Aloknath as part of the film
 ''tanushri datta ne kaha- ''de de pyaar de ke trailor or poster saamne naa aane tak kisi ko pataa nahin tha ki alokanath film kaa hissaa hai
 In such a situation, if Ajay Devgan and the makers wanted, he could quietly replace Aloknath
 unke seens ko rishute kar sakate the
 "let us tell you, Aloknath was accused of rape by Writer Vinata Nanda last year
 actor ke khilaaf cese bhi daayar kiya gaya tha
 In January this year, the Mumbai Sessions Court granted anticipatory bail to Aloknath

 If someone has misbehaved with the woman, neither i nor the ADF (ajay Devgan Films) will stand with that person

 If anyone has wronged even a single woman, neither ADF nor i will stand for it

 Blue line service was interrupted for 20 minutes at around 9 am today due to signal malfunction

 During this time people use metro service for their office
 isse pehle buudhvaar ko bhi dopaher ke samay blue line metro kii seva baadhit rahi thi
 The metroseva between Dwarka and Noida operates on automatic mode via central control at a frequency of about 4 minutes 30 seconds
 vahiin, yamuna bank se vaishali ke bich metro seva lagbhag 5 minute 30 second kii frequency par chal rahi he
 The metro signaling team is working on the improvement of the system and as soon as it is rectified, all the trains of the Blue Line will run on their own time as before

 karnataka kaa mukhyamantri to vahi banegaa, jise congress alaakaman kaa aashirwad praapt hoga, lekin pad kii hode main maujuud netaaon main sabase aage siddharmaiya chal rahe hai, jo kurba jati ke hai or obisi se aate hai
 Siddaramaiah is said to be a land leader, but one of his major drawbacks is that he has come to Congress from JDS
 vaise chunaav parinaamon ke aane ke baad dakshin karnataka kii varuna seat se paanch baar vidhayak rah chuke siddharmaiya ne daawa bhi kiya ki vah mukhyamantri pad ke sabase majboot daavedaaron main shaamil hai

 parameshwar acchhee angreji bolte hai, dilli main bade netaaon ke saath unki uth−baith he, lekin unke kaam karne kaa tarika manamaana bataaya jaataa he
 The third name is also of Mallikarjun Kharge, who is currently the Labor Minister at the Center and he is also a Dalit
 tippaniyan His image has been clean, but his information about the politics of the state is not considered much nor is he good in the state
 khadge ne bhi sanket diya he ki rajya main chunavi jeet ke baad yadi unke naam par vichaar hota he, to vah mukhyamantri banane ke liye taiyaar hai
 By the way, Union Minister Veerappa Moily's name is also being included among the contenders for the Chief Minister, as he is close to the Gandhi family, but the state leaders do not like him much
 siddharmaiya jameen se jude netaa kahe jate hai, lekin unki ek badi kami yah he ki vah jedies se congress main aae hai
 After the election results, Siddaramaiah, a five-time MLA from South Karnataka's Varuna seat, also claimed that he was among the strongest contenders for the post of Chief Minister
 doosraa naam ji parameshwar kaa he, jo karnataka congress ke adhyaksh hai or dalit hai
 Parmeshwar speaks good English, he is upbeat with big leaders in Delhi, but his way of working is said to be arbitrary

 The comments unki chhavi saaf-suthri rahi he, lekin rajya kii raajnneeti ke bare main unki jaankaree zyada nahin maani jaati he or na hi unki pakad rajya main acchhee he
 Kharge has also indicated that he is ready to become the Chief Minister if his name is considered after the election victory in the state
 vaise, kendriya mantri virappa moili kaa naam bhi mukhyamantri ke daavedaaron main shaamil kiya ja rahaa he, kyonki vah gandhi parivaar ke kareebi hai, lekin rajya ke netaa unhen zyada pasand nahin karte hai

 khabaron kii khuleam kharid-bikri ho rahi he, shbaren 'manage' kii ja rahi hai, pathakon-darshakon ko dhokhaa diya ja rahaa he or samachar media kaa agenda korporate puunji or raajnneetik satta pratishthan tay karne lage hai
 As a result, it has not even hesitated to openly bid all the ideals, values, principles and ethics of journalism for underworld profits
 haalanki isamen nayaa kuch nahin he
 Journalist and media analyst Dilip Mandal in his book 'media's Underworld: Paid News, Corporate and Democracy' admits that these trends have been seen in the Indian news media for a long time
 alabatta, pehle ye thodi dhaki-chhipin or dari-sharmaai-si thim lekin pichley kuch varshon main yah khulaa khel farrukhaabadi ho gaya he
 Meanwhile, this underworld of the media has not only increased its scope and dominance but has also largely reduced shame
 khaskar khabaron kii kharid-bikri yani ped news kaa chalan is had tak bad gaya he ki sansad se lekar sadak tak thu-thu hone lagi he
 Of course, due to this, the reputation of the news media is low
 loktantr ke chauthe khambhe or saarvajanik hiton ke paharedaar kii uski chhavi vikhandit hui he or us par saarvajanik taur par sawaal uthne lage hai
 Despite this, the media itself tried a lot to ignore it and despite everything being opened up, there still seems to be a great-grandeur
 yah sachmuch bahut hairaani kii baat he ki desh-duniya ke sabhi chote-bade muddon par charchaa or unki cheer-faad karne ko apana adhikaar samajhne vaala samachar media khud apane andar jhankane yaa apane bare main baaten karne ko bahut utsuk nahin dikhataa he
 But now the situation is slowly changing
 badhati aalochanaon ke kaaran media main khud ke kaamkaaj kii padtaal or charchaa hone lagi he
 The way media has expanded and increased its influence over the last one-and-a-half decades has led to a considerable interest in investigating and discussing its role and activities in the democratic structure
 isi kaa nateeja he dilip mandal kii kitaab
 This should be welcomed for several reasons
 yah na sirf samachar media main failte ped news ke cancer kii baarik padtaal karti he balki use media ke korporate dhaanche or uske vyapak raajnneetik arthshaastra ke sandarbh main jaanchane-parakhane kii koshish karti he
 In the process, it is largely successful in covering the underworld of the media, which has been overshadowing the mainstream of corporate media in recent years
 mandal kii kai sthapanaayen chaunkaati hai lekin unase asahmat hona mushkil he
 As such, the content of media today is almost entirely determined by the economics of media
 sampadakeey saamagree par ba
 The control of the jar is almost completely established
 vigyapandaata, kya chhapega ke saath hi kya nahin chhapega kaa bhi kaaphi had tak nirdhaaran karne lage hai
 "he also says that," because of this, the diversity of the content is also almost finished
 lagbhag sabhi mahatvapurn muddon par media ke vichaaron kaa maanakeekaran ho chukaa he
 "they don't stop here
" unka yah bhi maananaa he ki ''media main sampadak naam kii sanstha kaa lagbhag puri tarah se kshay ho chukaa he
 Editorial independence in the media business is no longer possible outside the purview of a newspaper or channel's commercial interests
 '' ve bahut belaag hokar kehete hai ki jo pathak yaa darshak kisi akhbaar yaa patrika yaa channel kii laagat kaa lagbhag 10 se 20 pratishat chukaa kar ummid karte hai ki ve use sahi suchanaaen denge yaa unke hit kii baat karenge, ve badi galatfahami main hai
 According to Mandal, the paid news is just a symptom of a serious illness suffered by the media
 ve aise anek lakshanon- privet treety, medianet, pi
 R
 kii khuli ghuspaith or media ke radiyakaran aadi kii charchaa karte hue media kii asli beemaari uske vyavsaayik dhaanche or lakshyon main dekhte hai
 Not only this, Mandals do not hide their disappointment about the current corporate structure of media ownership
 unhen is korporavt media se koi ummid nahin dikhti he
 They believe that it is the media
 jaar or vigyaapan kii vijay kaa daur he
 Certainly, the phenomenon of paid news is a danger bell for democratic politics
 media kaa anderworld loktantr kii jaden khodne main laga hua he
 But even more worrisome is the corporate takeover of the mainstream news media, which is not hesitating to go from news-buying to trading and manipulating the democratic process to advance profits and corporate interests
 haalanki mandal iskaa koi samaadhaan nahin sujhaate lekin sach yah he ki beemaari kii sahi padtaal se hi ilaaj kii shuruyaat hoti he
 In this sense, this book can be considered an important beginning

 dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke supremeo arvind kejariwal dwaara punjab ke purv rajasav mantri bikram singh majithia se maafee maangane ke baad punjab main aam aadmi party do faad ho gai he
 While one section of the party is standing with Arvind Kejriwal, the other faction has kept distance from Kejriwal and questioned his apology
 yahi kaaran he ki party haikaman dwaara ravivaar ko dilli main yojit baithak main 20 vidhayakon main se sirf 10 vidhayak hi baithak main pahunche
 That is, half the mlas are rebels and they have directly told the High Command that if they want to talk, then come to Chandigarh

 Not only this, Sukhpal Singh Khaira, the Leader of Opposition in Punjab who raised the tone of the rebellion against the party, refused to talk on this issue
 sukhpal singh khera ne kaha ki 'mujhe party ke masale par kuch bhi nahin kahana, agar koi baat kerani hogi to aapako bataa diya jayega
 Opposition parties are capitalizing on the controversy arising out of Kejriwal's apology
 akali dal netaa dow
 Daljit Singh Cheema said that the apology by Arvind Kejriwal has proved that he is a bigoted leader and he can say anything to mislead people even if an apology has to be made later
 punjab ke purv mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal pehle hi kah chuke hai ki 'mare or mukare' kaa koi vishwaas nahin kiya ja saktaa
 On the other hand, the reason for the apology given by Arvind Kejriwal to the 10 AAP mlas who went to attend the meeting on Sunday, is not embracing the BJP
 gauratlab he ki arvind kejariwal ne baithak main maujuudvidhayakonse kaha tha ki unke khilaaf 22 nyaayalayon main 33 mukademe darj kiye gaye hai jinaki pairvi main hi maheene ke 20 din guzar jate hai jisase dilli sarkaar kaa kaamkaaj prabhavit ho rahaa he
 Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Vineet Joshi said that Arvind Kejriwal's response to the lawsuit is only for Khanapurti as the cases were filed against Arvind Kejriwal and not against the Chief Minister of Delhi
 arvind kejariwal ek aise netaa hai jo bebuniyaad aarope lagane main maahir hai or kisi ko kabhi bhi kuch bhi kah sakate hai

 Israel has a history of its own, but the biggest issue about Israel is the relationship between Israel and Palestine

 It is ruled by 'hamas', an anti-israel terrorist group

 Since 1947, when the UN divided Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state, since then there has been a conflict between Palestine and Israel, with one important issue to accept as the Juice State, then the second is the Gaza Strip which established Israel
 The conflict between Israel and other Arab countries has been proved to be the cause of the time

 kabhi sainya takhtapalat main satta se bedakhal kiye gaye navaj sharif ek baar phir se pakistan ke loktantric singhaasana par asin ho gaye
 Called the 'lion of Punjab', Sharif has promised to restore the peace process with India
 unhone kaha ki badlaav ke liye mujhe sabakaa saath chahie
 Pakistan belongs to us and we have to work together
 gambhir muddon par sabko saath aana hoga
 If we meet all the issues will be resolved
 dehshatgardi kii maar jhel rahe or dehshatgardon kii panaahagaah ban chuke pakistan main bahut saare log sharif se badi ummid lagaae hue hai
 He feels that Sharif, who has held the reins of the country twice before, will work to bring the country's decaying economy back on track
 yah baat digar he ki sharif ko taliban ke prati naram mana jaataa he
 The 63-year-old Sharif, who became a steel tycoon, was ousted from power in 1999 by a military coup by Pervez Musharraf
 iske baad unhen jail janaa or apane mulk ko bhi chhodana padaa
 Sharif returned to Pakistan after seven years away from his land and returned strongly to power with the support of the people

 Sharif not only stopped the alleged 'tsunami' of Imran, but also failed it completely

 Sharif has promised to bring the country's economy back on track and remove corruption in government undertakings
 unhone lahore or karachi ke bich bullate train bhi chalaane kaa vaada kiya he
 When time turned, Sharif is in power and Musharraf remains a 'prisoner' in his own farmhouse
 aatmanirvaasan se laute musharraf ko apatkaal lagane sahit kai aarope hai
 During the election campaign, Sharif insisted on bringing the peace process with India back on track
 sharif ne kaha tha, hamen us sthaan se shuru karnaa hoga jahaan ham 1999 main the
 It was a happy moment and i would love to follow the same path
 hamen baithkar shantipurna dhang se sabhi masalon ko hal karnaa hoga
 India has welcomed his statement
 baharhaal, vah intjaar karne or dekhne kaa rukh apanaae hue he
 Meanwhile, during the election, Sharif's entire campaign was focused on the economy
 pakistan sanyukt raashtra ke maanav vikaas suchakank par 146wein sthaan par he
 The comments sharif kaa janm 1949 main lahore ke kaarobaari parivaar main hua tha

 He became the Finance Minister under the rule of the military ruler Zia-ul Haq and then the Chief Minister of Punjab

 He said that i need everyone's support for change
 pakistan ham sabakaa he or milakar kaam karnaa he
 Everyone has to come together on serious issues
 ham mil jaaen to saare masale hal ho jaaenge
 Many people in Pakistan, who have been facing the horror of terror and have become the refuge of terrorists, are expecting a lot from Sharif
 unhen lagata he ki pehle bhi do baar desh kii bagdor sambhaal chuke sharif is baar desh kii khastahal arthvyavastha ko patari par laane kaa kaam karenge
 It is a matter of fact that Sharif is considered soft towards the Taliban

 ) The NDA in Jharkhand suffered a setback on Wednesday when its ally Janata Dal United announced to field candidates for 22 seats due to the breakdown of the ongoing negotiations with the BJP over seat-sharing for the state assembly elections
 siton par nahin ban saki sahmatijadayu mahasachiv javed raja ne 81 sadasyeey jharkhand vidhansabha chunaav ke liye 22 siton main se apane 19 ummidavaaron ke naamon kii ghoshnaa kii or kaha ki teen siton ke liye ummidavaaron ke naam der raat tak tay kar liye jaayenge
 JDU president Sharad Yadav said, "there is no consensus on seats
" baatcheet vifal ho gayi he
 This is the situation right now
 ’’ unhone kaha ‘‘donon dalon ke netaaon ke bich teen din se baatcheet chal rahi thi
 We wanted to get at least 18 seats, because last time we had fought on the same number of seats
 ’’ party ke jharkhand pradesh adhyaksh jaleshwar mahato ne kaha ki hamane 22 siton kaa elaan kar diya he
 We want to contest elections together with BJP
 aage jo party netritv faisla karegaa uske hisaab se kaam kiya jaayegaa
 jdu's strength has increased, "last time we fought 18 seats and we won six seats
" iske alaava kareeb itani siton par ham duusare nambar par rahe the
 Apart from this, many prominent leaders like Raja Peter, and Shailendra Mahato have joined JDU in recent times and our strength has increased
 isi liye hamane kuch zyada siten maangi thi
 He said that the attitude of the BJP leaders was not satisfactory as they retracted every time
 majaboor hokar ham apane ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa kar rahe hai kyonki pehle charan ke matdaan ke liye namakan bharne ke liye ab do teen din se zyada kaa samay nahin rah gaya he
 Asked if the BJP agrees to 18 seats, you will remove four of your candidates, Mahato said, "the central leadership will decide in this regard
" ’’bhaajapa bhi kar chuki he 59 ummidavaaron kii ghoshnajharkhand vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bhaajapa or jadyu ke varisht netaaon ke bich pichley teen dinon main anek daur kii baatcheet hui thi
 The BJP on Tuesday announced the names of candidates for the 59 seats for Jharkhand
 jharkhand main rajg ke in donon ghatak dalon ne pichhlaa vidhansabha chunaav mil kar ladaa tha
 In the last election of the 81-member Jharkhand Assembly, JDU had fielded candidates for 18 seats and won six of these seats
 jharkhand main 25 navambar se paanch charnon main vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai
 Of the 22 seats whose names were released by JDU on Wednesday, the names of candidates for the Chandankiyari (: Su), Latehar (: Su :), Tundi and Chhatarpur seats are not included
 party ne kaha ki in teen siton ke ummidavaaron ke naam der raat tak tay ho jaayenge
 The party has fielded its state president Jaleshwar Mahato from Baghmara, while Shailendra Mahato from Bokaro, Madhu Singh from Panki, Gopalakrishna Peter aka Raja Peter from Tamar and Raja Marandi from Shikarpara will be the party candidates
 iske alaava party ne sarath se jai kumaar singh, devgarh se kameshwar nath das, mandu se kharu mahato, dumri se damodar mahato, hussainabad se dasharath kumaar singh, mandaar se vishwanath bhagat, vishrampur se si es doobe, bhavanathpur se ram chandra kesari, koderma se gopal yadav, hazaribagh se bateshwar mahato, hatiya se abhaya singh, barhi se pradeep kumaar singh or ganda se sanjeev sanjay ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 Surprising the BJP over the jdu's decision, BJP has expressed surprise and regret over the ongoing talks on seat sharing for the Jharkhand Assembly elections, broken by the ally JDU and unilaterally announced 22 seats
 bhaajapa ke chunaav prabharee mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha, ‘‘main yah khabar sun kar aahat or hairaan hum

 '' rajdhani dilli ke naujavaanon ke bich rev partiyon kaa hissaa bananaa ab nayaa states simbel ban gaya he
 Going to such parties and getting up late into the world of drug addiction without any restriction, many youngsters find it a 'cool idea'
 yahi vajah he ki police or narkotics control beuro kii tamaam paharedaari ke baavjood dilli or aas-paas ke ilaakon main aisi partiyon kaa gulzaar hona ab ek aam baat ban chuki he
 This may be shocking news for many people, but those watching this business know how Delhi and surrounding areas are constantly getting caught by rave parties
 abhi haal main dilli police ne ek aise videshi naagarik ko giraftaar kiya tha, jisane poochtacha ke dauraan mahaj do maheene main 20 se zyada rev partiyon ke aayojan kii baat kubul kii
 He said that with the help of well-known nobles of the city, he organized these parties at several farm houses in Mehrauli, Gurgaon and Sohna Road, some hotels and flats in Greater Kailash, New Friends Colony, Saket and Nehru Place
 chunki in partiyon main synthetics drugs ke alaava cocaine or heroin jaisi mahangi nashili vastuon kaa sabase zyada istemaal hota he, amir log bhi sabase zyada in partiyon kii giraft main hai
 The organizers of such parties give a feast between their groups by phone or SMS and then the addicts reach such safe places for all kinds of drugs
 chunki ye sabakuch behad khufia tareeke se hota he, police ko aksar inke bare main pataa hi nahin chalata
 And even if it is known many times, she does not risk disturbing these parties
 haalanki ab maamalon main to raison ke saath-saath madhyam varg ke noujvaan bhi rev partiyon main jane lage hai jabaki kai rev partiyaan to ladakiyon ke liye rape yani balaatkaar kii vajah bhi sabit hai he
 'high end' drugs are most commonly used in rave parties
 narcotics control beuro ne pichley ek saal main nashe kii jo khep baraamad kii he, us par nigaah daalane se bhi ye baat takreeban saaf ho jaati he ki kis tarah logon ke bich hai and drugs yani mahange nashe kaa chalan badha he
 In just one year, NCB has recovered 84 kg of 47 grams of heroin, while 26 kg of 34 grams of cocaine in Delhi and this consignment of drugs can be worth crores of rupees in the international market
 hindustan main har tabake ke bich jahaan tarah-tarah ke drug istemaal hote hai, vahiin 'drug abyuj' ke anginat tareeke hai
 But the rave parties among the youth is also a big danger, because now starting from 'peer pressure', these parties are now carrying the form of a 'mass hysteria' among the nobles

 Actress Swara Bhaskar has raised objections to the content of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavati
 unhone bhansaali ko open letters likhakar film main dikhaae gaye johar seen ko mahimamandit karne kii baat kahi he
 Swara has posted her open letter published in The Wire by tweeting
 iske baad swara kii is aapatti ko lekar soshal media par troling honi shuru ho gai
 a user has written, Take the life of Bhansali, previously the illiterate were behind, now the illiterate are behind
 ek anya yujar ne likhaa he ki sati hone or johar hone main kaaphi antar he
 One user has written that Swara should write on three divorces and Hallala, not on the practice that used to go on seven hundred years ago
 ek yujar ne kaha ki yadi koi gulaami par film banaata he to aisa nahin he ki gulaami kaa manhimamandan kiya ja rahaa he
 a user has written that you too have glorified stocking in Raanjhanaa
 i loved the performances by all the actors in # Padmaavat- The film is seductive in its grandeur, scale, beauty, power of its actors’s performances, music, design, vision

 Swara has written that through this film, Bhansali has glorified Sati and Jauhar
 swara film ke jariye striyon kii pesh hui chhavi se bahut naaraaz hai
 At the beginning of the open letter, Swara Bhaskar did Bhansali and praised the stars who worked in the film
 aage unhone likhaa ki mahilaon ko ‘vajaina’ ke taur par simit kar diya he
 At the end of the film, on the scene of Rani Padmavati burning herself to protect the honor, she writes, 'sir, women have the right to be alive apart from being victims of rape
 ''padmavat' dekh sari raat so nahin saki ye mashhoor actresspurush kaa matlab aap jo bhi samajhate ho-pati, rakshak, maalik, mahilaon kii sexuality tay karne vaale, unki maut ke baavjood mahilaon ko jivit rahane kaa haq he
 Swara adopting a more strident stance further, says, "women are not moving around
 haa mahilaon ke paas yah ang hota he lekin unke paas or bhi bahut kuch he
 Therefore, the entire life of the people should not be spent focusing on Vajina, controlling it, protecting it, keeping its purity

 Four coaches of the Sealdah Rajdhani, standing in the washing yard of the New Delhi Railway Station, were gutted
 aag itani teji se faili ki iske peeche khadi bhubaneshwar rajdhani ke dibbon main bhi aag fail gai
 Two boxes of it were also burnt
 ganimat ye rahi ki jaisi hi dibbon main aag lagi vahaan maujuud railway karmchaariyon ne jalte dibbon ko train se alag kar diya
 Otherwise the whole train burns down
 aag subah kareeb 11
 It was 30 o'clock when the two Rajdhani were standing at the washing yard
 inaki saaf-safai kaa kaam shuru hone se pehle hi achaanak sialdah rajdhani ke dibbe jalane lage
 Six trains of the fire brigade reached around 12 o'clock and the fire was controlled within two hours
 fire brigade ke adhikari aag lagane ke teen kaarnon par vichaar kar rahe hai
 First, there is a pipe to supply diesel under the bogie where it was standing
 tippaniyan Fire brigade officials say that it is more likely that the diesel pipeline may have leaked due to the rapid fire which has caused the fire because all the bogies in the capital were AC and locked on all sides
 doosraa kaaran sialdah rajdhani main pentry kii bogi he
 The third reason may be someone deliberately set fire
 deshbhar main alag-alag railway yard main khadi bogiyon main aag lagane kaa ye teesraa maamla he
 a high-level inquiry committee has been set up to investigate the matter
 lekin railway main rajdhani kii ek coach kareeb 2 se dhai karod main banakar taiyaar hoti he aise main 12 karod kii chapat railway ko jarur lag gai
 Thankfully, as soon as the coaches were on fire, the railway staff present there separated the burning coaches from the train
 varanaa puri train jalakar khaak ho jaati he
 Fire around 11 in the morning
 30 baje lagi jab ye donon rajdhani washing yard par khadi thi
 Suddenly, the cans of Sealdah Rajdhani started burning before their cleaning work started
 kareeb 12 baje fire brigade kii chah gaadiyaan pahunchi or do ghante main aag par kaabo paaya gaya
 Fire brigade officials are considering three reasons for the blaze
 pehla jahaan bogi khadi thi usee ke neeche dijal aapurti karne kaa ek pipe gaya he
 The comments fire brigade ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki jitani teji se aag lagi he usase is baat kii ashanka zyada he ki dijal pipe line se licage hua he or isi ke chalate aag lagi ho kyonki rajdhani kii sabhi bogiyaan asi thim or chaaro taraf se lock thi
 The second reason is the pantry bogey in the Sealdah capital
 teesraa kaaran kisi ne jaanboojhkar aag lagaai ho sakati he
 This is the third case of fire in bogies parked in different railway yards across the country
 is maamle kii jaanch ke liye ucchstareey jaanch cameti banaai gai he
 But in the railways, a coach of the capital is ready for about 2 to 2
5 crores, in such a situation, the railway definitely got 12 crores

 Both these Hindutva, BJP and Modi supporters on the Internet are the most well-known faces of the fraternity which has been making its mark in every debate on social media and internet

 These people are seen all around us

 They will always be found scouring the internet on their smartphones
 ve ek-duusare se aise network se jude hai jo vibhinn prishthbhumi ke logon ko ek manch par laa rahaa he
 He feels that his voice is being heard and that active political activists on social media are taking his words even further
 internet par is birdari kii prabhavi paith kaa pramaan india today samooh ke ellection surveykshan main dekha ja saktaa he
 In this survey, people were asked to vote on internet and mobile in Lok Sabha constituencies on the lines of general elections
 mobile phone par ek baar main ek password se mataptr kholane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya tha taaki ek mobile number se ek baar hi vot diya ja sake or dhaandhlee kii koi gunjaaish na rahe
 From 23 September to 30 October, out of a total of 5,56,460 votes, 3,38,401 voted for the BJP
 yahaan tak ki chautarafa mukaable vaale uttar pradesh main bhi 87
 1 percent of the vote was in favor of BJP
 is surveykshan ke nattejey bhale jamini hakeekat kaa bayaan na kar rahe hon par ek baat to shartiya taur par sabit karte hai ki internet bhagava rang main rang chukaa he
 Internet penetration in India, according to Istatindia
com, is only about 10 percent of the people and about 11 users
 618 karod hi hai
 But on the other hand, according to a Google survey in October, 4 out of every 10 urban voters i

 37 percent urban voters are now on the Internet
 hindutv kii ore jhuki yah internet birdari kai baar gaali-galouj par utar aati he
 It is generally anti-minority and always anti-government
 vah khud ko ab internet hindu kahlaana pasand karti he
 Gandhi says, "my mind blossoms when i call someone a Sanghi or a right-wing or an Internet Hindu
" mujhe lagata he ki kahuun 'vaah! kya baat he’
 "his language is young and colloquial
 (america kishoron vaale andaaj main har vaakya main 'o vaav like’ kii abhyast gandhi bhi isaki pushti karti hai
 ) But their agenda is a mixture of postmodern and tradition
 yah birdari khandaanshahi kii raajnneeti khaskar nehru-gandhi khandaan kii virdohi he lekin bijepi or uske shivasena jaise sahyogiyon main baap-bete kii raajnneeti par vah koi raay nahin rakhti
 She calls minority appeasement 'pseudo-secularism' with a tone that can easily be interpreted to mean Hindu hegemony or Muslim opposition
 ye log dalit or obisi aarakshan ke virdohi hai, khaskar isliye kyonki us par dhang se amal nahin hota
 He is concerned about the internal security of the country
 lekin sabase badhkar ve bhrashtachar ke khilaaf hai
 Modi's magnetic charm may not be seen by his extremely aggressive type of tweet, but there are many in this community who have become active on social media within a few years
 or us vakt bijepi yaa uski nitiyon kaa samarthan shaayad unka makasad na tha
 Take Pandey only

 Thirty-five-year-old Shilpi Tiwari studies Architect and now runs a consultancy firm with her husband
 shilpi bataati hai ki pehle ve sarkari pariyojnaon main shaamil rahi hai
 He was first attracted by Anna Hazare and his Jan Lokpal movement
 ve kahati hai, ''main ramlila maidan main hajaaron logon ke saath bhrashtachar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaa rahi thi
 Later, when the anti-congress and anti-government sentiments started intensifying, he leaned towards the BJP and especially Modi
 ab tiwari or unki tarah ke tamaam log yah maanate hai ki unki koshishon se hi modi bijepi main pradhanmantri pad kii ummidavaari kii res jeet sake hai
 She smiles, "we not only supported his candidature, but got it

 According to a survey by the IRIS Knowledge Foundation and the Internet and Mobile Association of India, social media is going to affect 160 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 general elections
 aktubar main google kaa surveykshan kahata he ki internet se jude sabhi shahari matadaataaon kaa kareeb 42 pratishat abhi bhi man nahin bana paaya he ki vah kisko vot de
 That way, a big vote bank can lean towards either
 haalanki isamen kisi ko hairat nahin honi chahie ki zyaadaatar shahari matadaataaon ne google par sabase zyada kisi netaa ko talasha he to ve hai narendra modi
 Although these internet warriors are from many saffron camps (see box), but a large part of them are attracted to Modi with great dedication
 use lagata he ki modi koi galati nahin karenge
 Pandey, Tiwari and a teenage RSS-BJP stalwart Sikh, 27-year-old Tejinderpal Singh Bagga, says he is not a blind devotee of Modi, but supports him because of his policies, his development mantra and his clean image
 
 lekin, jab unase poocha gaya ki kya modi ne apane samooche rajnatik kareer main aisa kuch kiya, jisase ve sahamat nahin ho pate hai to kisi ke paas unki koi bhi shikaayat nahin thi
 We asked, "so have they always been right?" Everyone responded more or less in the same way, "no", but no one had an answer to refute the question
 aisa lagata he ki adhakachari rajnatik samaj or bhavuk kism kii baaten hi online hindu spes main chai hui hai
 Historian Ramachandra Guha in his book Patriots and Partisans has devoted a chapter to 'hindutva Hate Mail' which he has received over the years as a writer and columnist
 kai email or sampadak ke naam patron main unhen gandhi parivaar kaa tattu vagairah bataaya gaya
 Guha believes that he has met "people who wake up in the dark, drink a glass of cow's milk, greet the sun and then open the internet to search for an idiom to send to today's seculars" Go
 ”guha kii baat par shabdash: yakeen karne ke apane khatre hai
 There is only a partial truth in his description of today's Hindu online warrior
 ab is birdari kii ek badi sankhya subah uthati he, jogging karne jaati he, ek cap blike coffee kaa swaad chakhti he or hajaaron ekjicutics tarah apni esayuvi start kar leti he
 These include doctors, engineers, IT professionals, bureaucrats, call center workers, journalists and business-industry professionals
 ve apane kaam main nipun hai lekin aksar unka uthlaa rajnatik gyaan unhen haasyaaspad bana detaa he or ve bevajaah aakraamak ho uthte hai
 Everything in their world is black and white, no other color is attached to it
 priti gandhi eiemiem netaa akbaruddin ovaisi ke pichley disambar main nafrat bhare bhaashan kii charchaa karte hue kahati hai, ''ham muslim virdohi nahin hai lekin agar aap hamen majaboor kar denge to pratikriya honi lajimi hi he
 Otherwise, some of my best friends are Muslims
 ” bidambnaa yah he ki online muhaavaron kii ek guide 'urban dictionari’ ke mutabik, 'mere kuch achche dost’ kaa arth ''kuch purvaagrahagrast log aisa kehete hai jab ve apane purvaagrah ke chakkar main bure funsate hai
 "only their strength, people of this online fraternity are now getting to know each other even in reality
 sabake paas ek-duusare ke email, phone number, pataa, hota he or sabaki koshish hoti he ki kuch antaraal par bhojan vagairah ke liye ikattha hua jaae
 They go to homes when they go to each other's city and talk about everything from children's education
 hakeekat main ek-duusare se bhent-mulaakaat is vajah se bhi hoti he ki internet par 'chhadam dharmanirpekshavaadiyon’ ke hamale ke dauraan ek-duusare kaa saath mili
 In a sense, this loose online fraternity also serves each other at times of need
 maheene bhar pehle 35 varshiya rudra shekhar (twitor par @rudrahindu) ne khud hi bataaya ki ve kidney kii beemaari kii vajah se aspataal main hai
 The online fraternity raised Rs 2 lakh for treatment by sending a message on Twitter
 rudra shekhar kaa 7 aktubar ko nidhan ho gaya
 His last wish was that his last rites be performed by wrapping his body in the BJP flag
 bagga kehete hai, ''ham unase kabhi mili nahin the lekin ve hamaare dost the
 Rudra Shekhar not only fulfilled his last wish, but Modi also paid his tribute to his father
 lekin is birdari ke sadasyon ke khilaaf asli shikaayat to yah he ki ve congress netaaon, samarthakon or un patrakaron ko dhundh-dhundh kar unka peechha karte hai jinhen ve sarkaar samarthak 'ped media’ kaa giroh bataate hai
 They speak in a very aggressive kind of code language (see box) and often get abused by debilitating debates
 congress ke samarthak bhi gaali-galouj kaa jawaab dete hai
 But they do not have that touch
 is tarah soshal media par rajnatik bahes kaa str kaaphi neeche gir jaataa he
 a Congress supporter Amresh Mishra then threatened Shilpi Tiwari with dire consequences in March
 haalanki congress kii tikhi awaajen amuman bijepi samarthakon kii sankhya or unki talkh bayani main kho-si jaati hai
 CNN-IBN deputy editor Sagarika Ghosh is constantly commenting on TV shows and articles
 ve kahati hai ki kai twit to yun hi halaki-fulki nuktachini hote hai lekin kuch behad khatarnaak
 In his words, "once someone wrote that he knows my child's school hours
" main kaaphi dar gai
 Such people are maligning Twitter, otherwise it is a wonderful democratic platform
 ”maamla yahaan tak pahunch gaya ki is may main bijpi kii ity ikai ke pramukh arvind gupta ne party padaadhikariyon, sadasyon or samarthakon ke liye soshal media ke dishanirdesh jari kiye
 This one-of-a-kind guideline states that "healthy debate on a wide range of issues is always welcomed as it develops an understanding of the complexity of the issues and its aspects"
 lekin bahes ashobhaneey vyavhaar main nahin badalani chahie
 "even if a part of the online brigade containing BJP or its supporters does not use vulgar language, the party cannot leave all those who are active on its side in the internet
 @hinduidf or @barbarindian jaise kai agyaat naam soshal media par lagaataar ashleel bhashaa kaa prayog karte hai lekin bijepi samarthak unhen kabhi kuch nahin kehete
 The reasoning behind this is that 'they may be radicals, but they are our own radicals
 ’ gupta kehete hai, ''internet bhi cinema yaa sangeet kii tarah samaaj kaa aainaa he
 Abusive speech usually comes from not knowing good language
 jaise college main aap kisi bahes main apni baat dhang se nahin rakh pate to ashleel kism kii aakraamakata par utar aate hai
 But such people are only five percent of the total
 hamaare zyaadaatar samarthak shikshit or aadhunik hai
 "while this online fraternity's language, its meaning and its beliefs may remain in scope for debate, most people come from good intentions
 or vah iraadaa he rashtrawaad kaa
 They have a passion for nationalism and they want to fight against injustice on the basis of their ideas and bring about effective change
 thode theth bhadesapan, kam tarkshakti or thodi nakaaratmakataa ke saath unke apane nayakon kaa akalan unhen ek gambhir rajnatik birdari ke rup main tabdeel kar rahaa he
 On the supremacy of BJP on the Internet, Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha says, "the propaganda works like this
 baar-baar or oonchi aawaaj main ek hi baat bolni padati he
 They bombard people with words and thoughts
 pichley saal tak soshal media par congress kii upasthiti lagbhag nahin ke baraabar thi, isliye ve itnaa chadh gaye
 Now Congress has also started work on this
 soshal media aisa manch he, jisamen pehle pahunchane vaale kii badhat thode samay main hi khatm kii ja sakati he
 "but the Congress's perception that the bjp's Internet supporters are base is fabricated and bogus, because the figures also say something
 soshal media ne saaf jaahir kar diya he ki 2014 ke aam chunaavon main vah kya chahta he
 Other parties can take comfort in thinking that the online community will not decide who gets the power of the country
 na hi abhi aap apane vot twit kar sakate hai
 At least it is not possible now

 Kangana Ranaut's 'manikarnika' Movie Review: Subhadra Kumari Chauhan's poem 'khoob ladi mardani woh to Jhansi wali rani thi' has been listening since childhood and this poem has created an image of Rani of Jhansi in our mind
 lekin jhaansi kii rani kii ek chhavi kangana ranut (kangana Ranaut) 'manikarnikah da queen of jhaansi' main bhi lekar ai hai
 Kangana Ranaut has portrayed the character of Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi on screen, but 'manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi' does not seem to be judging with this legend character and the biggest lapse of weak direction film is
 film ke diarection ko lekar hui jang to vaise bhi jagajaahir he or aakhir main kangana ranut (kangana Ranaut) ko kaman apan haathon main leni padi
 Weak directions and childish talk dominate the entire film
 filmon main angrejon ke bolne ke dhang or andaaj par kuch or kaam kiya janaa chahie varna yah bahut haasyaaspad lagata he kyonki yah andaaj ab purana ho chukaa he
 The story of 'manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi (manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi)' begins with the birth of Manikarnika and it is announced in childhood that she should not be long but will have a big name
 kangana ranut (kangana Ranaut) kii entry baagh ke shikaar ke saath hoti he or kangana bahut khubasurat bhi lagati hai
 Manikarnika is chosen for the king of Jhansi and upon marriage her name is Lakshmibai
 lekin bachche ke nidhan hone kii vajah se angrej jhaansi ko 'hadap kii niti' ke tahat hadapney kii koshish karte hai or phir jhaansi kii rani elaan kar detii he ki vah apni jhaansi kisi ko nahin degi
 The story of the film is unable to connect and in the first half, it borrows a lot of songs and slow stories
 jhaansi kii rani (jhansi Ki Rani) ke bachapan ko dikhaaya nahin gaya he
 The film fills when the battle begins in the second half
 lekin puri film ati naatakeeyata kii vajah ye stage play jaisi lagane lagati he
 Scene repetition also bothers
 'manikarnikah da queen of jhaansi (manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi)' main kangana ranut (kangana Ranaut) rani lakshmibai ke kirdaar main jamati hai, lekin kai baar expreshans over ho jate hai or vahaan majaa bighad jaataa he
 Then, even in the process of showing the color of patriotism in a large amount, both the expressions and the acting derail
 jhaansi kii rani kaa ant bahut tang karata he kyonki hamane jis jhaansi kii rani ke bare main padhaa he, vah angrejon se ladate hue ghayal hone ke baad gangadas ke ashram main jaakar dam todatii he
 But the ending shown in 'manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi' makes it a bit annoying
 film main ankitha lokhande or atul kulkarni bhi he or unhone bhi thik-thaak acting kii he
 The dialogue of 'manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi (manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi)' is written by Prasoon Joshi, and he does not work at all touching the heart
 film ke songs ke maamle main bhi prasoon joshi puri tarah chook gaye hai
 The songs of 'manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi' break the flow of the film and in the first half, they are provocative
 'manikarnikah da queen of jhaansi' kaa bajet lagbhag 100 karod rupee bataaya jaataa he, lekin kamjor diarection or bachakaani acting kii vajah se 'jhaansi kii rani' kii byopic niraash karti he or dil todakar rakh detii he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has left for Davos to attend the World Economic Forum (WEF)
 21 saal baad koi bhartiya pradhanmantri is manch par pahunchaa he
 HD Deve Gowda arrived here in 1997 before PM Modi
 devgauda ke us daure par desh ke nami udyogpati rahul bajaj ne sawaal uthaae hai
 He said that it is very unfortunate that Deve Gowda came to have a picnic with the family on this important tour
 piem modi ke daure se ham utsahitrahul bajaj ne kaha ki abpiem modike aane se ham log behad utsahit hai
 Now India is the fastest growing economy in the world
 hamaare saamne abhi kai chunautiyaan hai, lekin ab hamaare piem bahut achche hai
 India is currently a young country
 adhikansh log 35 se kam umr ke hai
 If we provide them education and skill, then they will further increase the strength of the country
 jiesti-notebandi sakaaratmak kadamrahul bajaj ne jiesti par kaha ki ye bahut hi sakaaratmak kadam he
 We are very excited about PM Modi coming here
 kal kaa din bahut bada rahegaa, jab piem yahaan bhaashan denge
 He said that the whole world knows that demonetisation is very effective in the long run
 bajaj ne modi par bharosa jataate hue kaha ki hamen yakeen he ki piem kii aguwai main desh kii aarthik raftaar nai oonchaaiyon ko chhuegi
 The Finance Minister or another officer used to go to Davos in the last two decades only the Finance Minister or any other officer used to go there from India
 echdi devgauda june, 1996 main desh ke 11wein pradhanmantri bane the
 a few months after becoming Prime Minister, he went to participate in the World Economic Forum
 devgauda ke vakt halaat the alagadevgaudaki tulana main modi kii yah daavos yatra desh ke liye aage badhane ke lihaaj se behad khaas he
 The conditions of the country were not good at the time when Dev Gowda traveled, but now the atmosphere has changed and Modi is going to Davos with some new intentions
 modi ne khud hi daavos kii yatra ko lekar kaha tha ki duniya bhalee-bhaanti jaanati he ki daavos aarthik duniya kii ek badi panchayat ban gaya he or yahaan aarthik maamalon ke diggaj ikattha hote hai or bhavi aarthik sthitiyon ke bare main dasha or disha tay karte hai
 If the path to become a Telangana state is cleared, the demand for many more small states has started gaining momentum
 kal tak harith pradesh, mithilanchal, vidarbha or gorkhaland kii maang uthi thi aaj purvanchal kii maang ne jor pakadaa he
 Purvanchal's demand has been raised by Congress leader Jagadambika Pal himself
 jagdambika paal ne kaha, 'kshetra ke logon kii ichha he ki alag purvanchal rajya bane
 The states of Bihar and UP should be merged to form a state
 'alag rajya banane ko lekar jo aag andhrapradesh main lagi he, sabase pehle uski tapan maharashtra pahunchin
 Vilas Muttemwar, a senior Congress leader, on Tuesday raised the demand for a separate Vidarbha state to be carved out of Maharashtra
 isse silsile main unhone congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko chitthee bhi likhi
 BJP, which has always been a champion of small states, supported his demand
 vidarbha khanij or prakritik sansadhano ke lihaaj se bhale hi dhani kshetra he
 But Vidarbha is considered behind in terms of development
 vidarbha se aane vaale netaaon ke mutabik vidarbha kii tulana main pashchimi maharashtra ko hameshaa tavajjo di jaati he
 Vidarbha was never given its right
 vidarbha ko alag rajya banane ke mudde par mukhyamantri prithviraj kii cabinet ke mantri bhi bijepi ke sur main sur mila rahe hai
 But ally Shivesana is strongly against the BJP on this issue
 shivasena ko maharashtra se alag vidarbha katai manjuur nahin he
 Apart from Vidarbha, the demand for the creation of Gorkhaland from West Bengal, Bodoland from Assam and Harit Pradesh from Uttar Pradesh has also gained momentum
 kendriya mantri ajit singh nit rashtriya lok dal (RLD) ne pehle hi uttar pradesh ke pashchimi hisson ko lekar ek alag harith pradesh ke nirmaan kii apni maang mukhar kar di he
 He is also in favor of creating a separate Bundelkhand state
 yah kshetra uttar pradesh or madhya pradesh ke bich main vibhajit he
 Supporters of Gorkhaland and Bodoland threatened to intensify their agitation for the formation of a separate state
 unka kahana he ki telugana ke gathan ke saath kendra unhen unki puraani or nyyochit maang se vanchit nahin rakh saktaa he
 On Tuesday, the second day of a 72-hour bandh called by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha in Darjeeling hills to demand Gorkhaland, a GJM supporter in Kalambong's Dambarchauk attempted self-immolation
 police ne kaha ki kalimpong ke rahane vaale mangal singh rajput (45) ne khud par petrol udel liya or bheedbhad vaale dambarchowk kii taraf badhkar khud ko aag laga lee
 Stunned by the incident, people rushed to save him and tried to extinguish the fire

 com had given a new direction, Surendra Pratap Singh gave Hindi journalism a new thought
 log unhen pyaar se es
 P
 kehete the
 After 1970, Hindi journalism took a new turn
 yah na keval aakaar main vyapak ho rahi thi, balki apni pravritiyon main bhi prayogdharmi ban rahi thi
 Till the 1970s, most of the editors of Hindi were originally litterateurs and journalism was considered a secondary work
 es

 kii peedi ne in muhaavaron ko todaa
 There was a generation of Hindi-ready Hindi journalists, who adopted it as a profession and also achieved professional quality
 is peedi ko taiyaar karne main es
 P
 kii badi bhoomika he or iske liye ve yaad kiye jate rahenge
 But his second feature is to raise Hindi journalism to the level of thinking
 hindi sahitya kii tarah hindi patrakarita main koi pragatisheel dhara nahin thi
 Hindi journalists used to come from the urban middle class, who lived in villages till generation-two generations ago and they still had a connection there

 He was also interested in removing economic disparities and was no different from the Marxist or Nehruvian socialist concerns, but in the 1990s he was surprised when social democracy was raised with the slogan of social justice

 Most Hindi journalists gave up a jihad to protest against the reservation
 iskaa kaaran tha inke vargeey or varniya sanskaar
 The writer-journalist of the leftist stream was also in protest
 sansad main mukhya rup se teen saansadon ne is faisle kaa virodh kiya tha, jisamen do communist or ek saamanti parivaar kaa congressi tha
 The political tradition of lohia-karpoori, who spoke in favor of reservation, was politician, but writer-journalist were equal
 aise main es
 P
 ne morcha sambhala
 In support of the share of the Dalit-backward classes, in support of the Mandal Commission's recommendations, ie, reservation - they started running the pen
 phir kuch or logon kii himmat hui
 He gave a logical answer to the arguments of the opponents of reservation
 is tarah ek soch, ek vaataavaran viksit hua

 The main subjects are - social justice, communalism, politics, Congress, third front, BJP, election-politics, Kashmir problem, corruption, economics, socio-culture and journalism
 yah sankalan hindi patrakarita ke ek vishisht daur se hamaara parichay karaata he
 The topics of most articles are so abstract that they give a direction to our thinking and thinking
 hindi samaaj, sahitya, raajnneeti or isaki maansikta jaise vishyon par es

 His views on sex and sexuality and even homosexuality are compiled

 From morning till early morning, his brightness would be seen in the whole sky from far away

 There was less and less dissatisfaction in the surrounding wires, but they were left under the curse

 But some stars were extremely disturbed by such suicidal activities going on around

 He devised the tactic, saying that 'do not bother with the likes of others
 har saadhaaran asaadhaaran hota he
 "for two hours, space scratched the beard, then took one look towards the earth and suddenly said with glowing eyes," My good children, take it, all of you have also been arranged

 Perhaps for such fragile occasions, Shakeel Badauni wrote: Some lost the fear of winning
 ab yah shartiya taur par to nahin kaha ja saktaa ki iske player bel kaa sherbet pikar maidan main utarate hai yaa vipashyana karke
 But his mentor VVS Laxman, who gave a new turning point to the history of Test cricket, has definitely been reading the Gita
 ve kehete bhi the ki ‘main nahin dekhtaa, mujhase pehle koun khelkar gaya he yaa team kii abhi kya sthiti he
 i play my game ’ match main kaisaa bhi tanaav bharaa lamhaa ho, bandon ke upar koi fark hi nahin padataa
 All the small and big totals are standing together and then with arms extended, they stand up wide to defend it
 jaise kah rahe hon ki ‘aao, jitna bhi he, jaraa hasil karke dikhaao

 And look at that Afghan bowler Rashid Khan! Some clues from the Chittavans are of the null, the trick reflects the simplicity of the Kafir
