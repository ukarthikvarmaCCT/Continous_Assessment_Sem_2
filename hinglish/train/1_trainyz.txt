 usee din jab vimaan bengalooru pahunchaa, to landing ke vakt bengalooru kaa mausam kaaphi kharaab rahaa
 The landing of Go Air's aircraft in a difficult situation was also very dangerous, which is why the plane took off from the runway, moving in a grassy area and landing on a bumpy place

 Expressing happiness over this arrest, Dr
 Hareed, son of Dr
 Narendra Dabholkar told Aaj Tak that this arrest took place two and a half years after the arrest of Dr
 Virendra Tawde
 saath hi unhen ummid he ki jaanch team ab jald hi mukhya sutaradhar tak pahunchakar use benakaab karne main kaamyaab hogi
 Hameed said that this investigation is taking place in the monitoring of the High Court and that the killers of Pansare, Kalburgi and journalist Gauri Lankesh are also expected to be arrested soon
 dow
 Milind Deshmukh, who worked with Dabholkar in the Andhrashrada Nirmulan Samiti since 1989, told Aaj Tak that according to the forensic lab report, Dabholkar, Kalburgi and Pansare were fired on the three with the same pistol
 gauri lankeshke hatya ke maamle main jinhen giraftaar kiya gaya, unase mili jaankaree kii madad se aties ne pichley dinon jo karrwai kii he

 If the investigation team had questioned people of such ideology from the beginning, then the killing of Pansare, Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh could have been averted

 BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley fiercely questioned on the occasion of completion of four years of UPA-2
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar har morche par naakaam rahi he
 Sushma Swaraj said that the government has no right to celebrate the completion of four years
 kaayade se use desh ke logon se maafee maangani chahie
 Should be self-concerned
 arun jetali ne kaha ki sarkaar kii uplabdhi bas itani he ki usne chaar saal puure kar liye
 This achievement was also achieved because the government abused the CBI heavily
 agar sarkaar sibiai kaa durupyog na karti to sapa or basapa usko hameshaa na bachaate rahete
 On this occasion, both directly targeted the Prime Minister
 sushamaa ne kaha ki manmohan singh na netaa ban paae na pradhanmantri, jabaki arun jetali ne kaha ki pradhanmantri kaa ohada majaak kaa paatr banakar rah gaya he
 In fact, the BJP has been alleging that despite Manmohan Singh being the Prime Minister, all decisions are taken by President Sonia Gandhi
 sushamaa or jetali ne kaha ki sarkaar loktantric sansthaaon kaa sammaan nahin karti
 He has brought down the stature of all institutions
 sirf bhrashtachar main lipt rahi he
 At the same time, the government has also failed on the foreign policy front
 maldive jaisaa chota desh bhi hamen aankh dikhaata he
 It took so long to resolve the Chinese incursion issue
 bijepi ne sarkaar kii aarthik nitiyon par bhi hamalaa kiya
 Sushma Swaraj said that growth rate alone cannot be a measure of economy
 7
 Projects worth 5 crores are stalled
 bhrashtachar kii vajah se janata buree tarah mahangaai jhel rahi he
 Sushma alleged that PM increases the prices and decreases Sonia
 sushamaa ne kaha ki upie-2 raajnneetik taur par naakaam rahi
 There is no coordination between the organization and the UPA government
 gathbandhan ko jo netritv chahie, vah nahin mila he
 The comments jetali ne kaha ki jab desh kii raftaar kam thi tab bhi kisi ne policy paralisis shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 Today there is so much stagnation in policies that the government is being criticized everywhere
 lokapal par andolan ke baavjood bill nahin bana
 He further said that the country has never seen such an atmosphere of despair
 yah sarkaar ahankaar se bhari he
 Next week we will organize Jail Bharo agitation against the policies of the government
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki sarkaar ko chaar saal puure karne kaa jashn manaane kaa haq nahin he
 As a rule, he should apologize to the people of the country
 aatmachintan karnaa chahie
 Arun Jaitley said that the achievement of the government is just that it has completed four years
 yah uplabdhi isliye bhi hasil hui ki sarkaar ne sibiai kaa jamkar durupyog kiya
 Had the government not misused the CBI, the SP and the BSP would not have always protected it
 is maukey par donon ne sidhe pradhanmantri par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Sushma said that Manmohan Singh could neither become a leader nor a Prime Minister, while Arun Jaitley said that the position of the Prime Minister has been left as a joke
 darasal, bijepi kaa aarope lagaati rahi he ki manmohan singh ke pradhanmantri hone ke baavjood sabhi nirnay adhyaksh sonia gandhi dwaara liye jate hai
 Sushma and Jaitley said that the government does not respect democratic institutions
 usne tamaam sansthaaon kaa kad giraaya he
 Only indulged in corruption
 saath hi sarkaar videshniti ke morche par bhi asafal rahi he
 Even a small country like Maldives shows us the eye
 chini ghuspaith mudde ko sulajhane main itnaa samay laga
 The BJP also attacked the government's economic policies
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki sirf vikaas dar arthvyavastha kaa paimaana nahin ho sakati
 7
 5 karod ke project ruke hue hai
 Due to corruption, the public is facing inflation
 sushamaa ne aarope lagaaya ki ki piem daam badhaate hai or sonia kam karti hai
 Sushma said that UPA-2 failed politically
 sanghathan or upie sarkaar main talmail nahin he
 The leadership that the coalition needs has not been found
 tippaniyan Jaitley said that no one used the term policy paralysis even when the pace of the country was low
 aaj nitiyon main itnaa tehraav he ki har taraf sarkaar kii aalochana ho rahi he
 The bill did not come despite the movement on Lokpal
 aage kaha ki maayusi kaa aisa maahaul desh ne kabhi nahin dekha
 This government is full of arrogance
 agle saptaah ham sarkaar kii nitiyon ke khilaaf jail baro andolan karenge

 The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has received a major setback from the Supreme Court
 supreme court ne kolkata main chal rahe siyaasi drame par turant sunwaayee se manaa kar diya he
 The Supreme Court says that if there is strong evidence against the Kolkata Police Commissioner, he is ready to take action
 supreme court ne sibiai se kaha he ki vah pehle saboot pesh karen, agar kamishnar ke khilaaf saboot hai or wo doshi hai to unpar kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 The matter will now be heard on Tuesday in the Supreme Court
 supreme court ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki sabhi paksh apane saboot pesh karenge
 Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said that even if the Kolkata Police Commissioner thought of erasing any kind of evidence, he would regret it
 aap is mudde par saboot pesh karen
 On behalf of the CBI in the Supreme Court, the Solicitor General said that we have applied that the evidence of the trial is being destroyed
 is daleel par supreme court ne sabhi pakshon se saboot pesh karne kii baat kahi he
 The CBI has written in its petition that the West Bengal government and police are not cooperating in their investigation
 unhone ye bhi daawa kiya he ki donon hi supreme court ke aadesh kii avmaananaa kar rahe hai
 The political drama continues from yesterday evening and high profile drama was played in Kolkata
 desh ke itihaas main aisa pehali baar hua he jab sabase badi jaanch agency ke 5 afasaron ko hi rajya kii police ne hiraasat main le liya
 Now this battle has become center versus state
 haalanki kuch der baad unhen reeha kar diya gaya
 At the same time, the entire CBI office was also cordoned off by the police
 haalanki kuch der baad siaisef ko vahaan tainaat kar diya gaya
 The CBI team investigating the Saradha chit fund scam reached the Kolkata Police Commissioner's house on Sunday evening, and what happened to them never happened in history
 mamata kii police ne sibiai ke adhikariyon ko vahiin roak liya
 They took down their driver and took him to the police station and later also detained five officers
 baad main unhen reeha kar diya gaya
 It is now believed that the CBI may plead with the Governor on this stand of Mamta Banerjee
 sibiai ke sutron kaa kahana he ki unhen andeshaa he ki kamishnar ke ghar jaruri document ko nasht kiya ja saktaa he
 It is being told that the CBI can now request the Governor to deal with this situation
 iske alaava sibiai ke antarim diarector nageshwar raav ne kaha ki unhone pashchim bengal ke dijipi ko patr likh police kamishnar se poochtacha ke bare main bataa diya tha
 So to say that this action is not right, it is completely wrong
 idhar mukhyamantri mamata banerjee khulkar police kamishnar ke bachaav main khadi ho gai hai
 The fight has now shifted from the police versus the CBI to the Center and the state government
 is bich kolkata police sibiai ke joint diarector pankaj shrivastav ko giraftaar karne ke liye unke ghar ravaanaa ho gai he
 In this case, former joint director of CBI Navneet Vasan has expressed surprise at Mamta Banerjee's attitude towards the police
 unhone kaha ki aakhir kis aadhaar par police ne sibiai ke adhikariyon ko giraftaar kiya he
 It is very unfortunate to surround the CBI office in the state

 It is election season, so the crop of vote making is being cut from place to place

 This is because today the company is about to launch Galaxy Note 8
 isaki ahmiyat company ke liye kai myanon main zyada he
 The Galaxy Note 7 has been the biggest setback for the company in the history of Samsung Mobile
 Galaxy Note 7 kii bydaree fatne lagi or iskaa silsilaa thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa tha or aakhirkaar company ne ise hameshaa ke liye band karne kaa faisla kiya
 The Galaxy Note 7 was considered to be Samsung's best phablet ever
 isliye company ke upar is baar badi jimmedaari he
 Samsung will host the Unpacked 2017 event in New York, which will start at 8
30 pm Indian time
 is dauraan company apaneflagship fablet Galaxy Note 8ko launch karegi
 You can watch the launch event via live streaming
 iske liye company kii aadhikarik website se aapako link mil jayega
 The pictures and specifications of the Galaxy Note 8 have been leaking much earlier and so far we have a lot of information
 aaie jaanate hai is flagcip fablet main kya khaas hoga or kyo ho sakati he isaki keemten
 Evan Blass, who is an expert in leaking information and photos before the smartphone launch, has shared its photos
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki yah tasviir Galaxy Note 8 kaa aadhikarik poster he
 Dual rear camera setup can be seen in it
 isaki khaasiyat kam bejal badi screen, do camera, dedicadet biksabi batan or dual flash is smartphone main honge
 Talking about the specifications, the specifications of the Galaxy Note 8 will be similar to the company's current flagship Galaxy S8
 kyonki isamen bhi letest hardware hai
 The user interface will be similar to the Note series in which the stylus will have more use
 is li main dekha ja saktaa he fingerprint scinar Galaxy S8 jaisaa hi hoga or usee jagah par hoga
 It was expected that the company will give a front fingerprint scanner this time, but can be given in the back again
 Galaxy S8 main rier fingerprint scinar diya gaya he jisaki vajah se kuch logon ne ise naapsand bhi kiya he
 Talking about design and display, it has 6
 3 inch kii screen di ja sakati he jiskaa rijolushan3840x2160 hoga
 Its display will be Quad HD
 bejal kaaphi kam honge or screen tu body reshyo 2:1 kaa hoga

 samsung pehali baar is fablet ke saath dual camera laa sakati he
 Almost all big companies including Apple and LG have launched two-camera smartphones

 bispi supremeo mayawati bhi purvanchal main apni party ko zyada se zyada siten jitvaana chaahati hai
 One of the main reasons for Mayawati's success in this mission can be Mukhtar Ansari, who holds a considerable hold in Purvanchal
 gauratlab he ki mukhtaar ansaari cycle se utadakar hathi par baith chuke hai
 Mayawati's look at Muslim votes has led to a furore over Muslim votes in the BSP, sp-congress alliance in the elections
 mayawati ne is chunaav main 97 muslim pratyaashee utaare hai
 By taking out such a large number of Muslim candidates, Mayawati is trying to give a message to Muslims that BSP is most concerned about Muslims
 rahi baat purvanchal kii to vahaan mayawati ke paas ilaake kaa sabase prabhavi naam mukhtaar ansaari he or wo is sahare purvanchal ilaake se adhik se adhik siten nikaalane kii ummid lagaae baithi hai
 In the last phase, the seats of Varanasi and Ghazipur districts are
 yahaan mukhtaar ansaari bispi ke liye fademundar sabit ho sakate hai
 The percentage of Muslims in the state is 19%
 mayawati ko is baat kaa bharosa heki agar 23% dalit or 19% muslim mil jaaen to ve chunavi yatra aasaani se paar kar jaaengin

 Chagrangangoli Chandel dismisses discussions after Kangana dispute with journalist, Ekta also rejects Javabrangoli, says, both are in touch, looking for good opportunities for work
 Reports show that Gossip's market has been hot over time between producers Ekta Kapoor and Kangan Ranaut
 kuch reports main kaha gaya ki kangana or ekta ke bich rishte kharaab hai
 Because of these, the possibility of not working with both of them again in the future was also expressed
 deccan chronical ne bhi apni ek report main aisa hi kuch kaha
 However, the reaction of Kangana's sister Rangoli Chandel and producer Ekta Kapoor on the matter has come to light after the news reported to date by Deccan Chronicle
 rangoli chandel ne tamaam gocips ko lekar kaha, "priy media ji, kangana or ekta donon ek-duusare ke tach main hai
 Both of them have learned a lot from the film Judicial Hai Kya
 donon phir aage saath kaam karne ke achche maukey kii talash main hai
 "on this tweet by Rangoli Chandel, Ekta Kapoor rubbished all rumors
 ekta kapur ne likhaa, "sachche dil se gale lagaaya
 "such was the media report discussed in a report by Deccan Chronicle that" Ekta belongs to this industry and she knows how it works here
 ve hameshaa media or industry ke saath achche or friendli sambandh share karti ai hai, lekin kangana ke gairajaruri ravaiye ke chalate ye secentive film (jajmental he kya) kaaphi prabhavit hui or ekta is cheez ko lekar khush nahin hai
 "" The film has been well received by the critics, but this film has failed to attract the audience completely
 ekta kapur kaa maananaa he ki is film ko jitna safal hona chahie tha or iskaa jitna prabhaav padana chahie, vaisaa hone main ye film naakaam rahi he
 Ekta Kapoor was also absent at the film's success party
 film 'jajmental he kya' ke song launch par kangana ranut ek patrkaar se bhid gayi or film anachaahe kaarnon se surkhiyon main aa gai thim
 Since then, things are not going well between Kangana and Ekta
 "gauratlab he ki jajmental he kya ke event main kangana or ek patrkaar ke jhagade ke baad ekta kapur ke production ne media se maafee bhi maangi thi or is ghatana ko lekar khed bhi jataayaa tha
 However, the Entertainment Journalists Guild of India said that they have accepted Ekta's apology and said that the film will not be harmed due to the controversy
 haalanki ve kangana par bain jari rakhenge jab tak ve publikali maafee nahin maangati hai
 Kangana rejected the demands of the journalists
 agar aap kisi relationships main he to partner ko chaahana buree baat nahin par aapkaa pyaar itnaa zyada naa ho ki wo saamne vaale ko boj kii tarah lagane lage
 Keep these things in mind and stop worrying about it, there will always be nothing to worry about it so that it does not go far away from you
 khud par or apane pyaar par bharosa rakhen
 Do not put a stop to their arrival or try to track them through the phone
 aapako or unako kareeb le aegi ek chutki hing, jaane kaiseek-duusare ko spes denek duusare ko puraa spes den
 It is very important to have space in the relationship
 ye yaad rakhie ki uske jivan main keval aap hi nahin hai, or log bhi hai
 Do not Ignore at the beginning of a relationship
 These 5 things do not talk about breaking the relationship
 Experts say that the weakest link in any relationship is lack of trust
 agar aap choti choti baton par dur jane kii dhamkee denge, to yakeen maniye ek din wo dhamkee kisi kaam kii nahin rahegi
 These 5 things will make you feel confident, you have got LOVE hopes, you have to understand that it has its own life, work
 aapaki har ummid par wo khara utre, ye jaruri nahin
 So keep the expectations low

 dilli kaa dhyaan kaamanwealth games kii taiyaariyon par he or dengue kaa machhar dillivaasiyon ke liye maut kaa intjaam kar rahaa he
 The number of dengue patients in Delhi is increasing daily, but the danger is going to end here, your throbbing news is that the dengue virus is getting stronger, its fifth strain is being prepared so that our body's immune system will not be able to fight and Dengue will spread rapidly
 machhar aaj dilli main kaiyon kii maut kaa kaaran ban gaya he
 Hundreds of patients are admitted to the hospital due to the dreaded dengue disease and are praying for survival
 lekin dilli main abhi jo halaat hai vah aage aane vaale khatre ke aage to kuch bhi nahin
 The real danger lies ahead
 ji haa desh ke nami aspataal ol india ististuit of medical sciencense yani ames ke microbiology vibhaag kii ek study se pataa chalaa he ki dengue ke marij dilli or ensiaar ke tamaam aspataalon main bhare pade hai
 It is becoming difficult for hospitals to provide beds to dengue patients
 puri dilli main dengue ke badhate maamalon se ham aap dare sahame hai lekin aage aane vaale khatre ke aage to ye kuch bhi nahin
 Dengue-spreading viruses are changing forms
 jisase dengue virus kii nai strain paidaa ho sakati he or yah nai strain hogi pehle se kaaphi khatarnaak
 Beyond this, we will also have resistance capacity, helpless and immune system will not be able to kill new strains
 abhi dengue virus ke chaar strain maujuud hai
 The fifth strain of dengue virus will be more powerful
 yani nai strain paidaa hote hi dengue or teji se failega
 Many times more patients will be in hospitals than today
 study kaa matlab saaf he agar dengue failaane vaale machharon kaa khaatmaa nahin hua
 In the same way, the dengue virus is on the rise, the destruction of Delhi is certain
 yah jaankaree dene kaa matlab ye nahin ki aapke dil main dar paidaa kar de
 The purpose is to warn you in time, warn against the danger of coming
 aaj dengue ne jo dilli kii haalat kar rakhi he or vah hamen aapako pareshaan karne ke liye kaaphi he
 Hospitals are full of patients, the number of patients is continuously increasing
 asaliyat ye he ki marijon kii taadaad sarkari aankadon se kahin zyada he
 There have been 54 new cases of dengue in the last 24 hours and according to government figures the number of dengue patients has crossed 450
 vaise sarkari aankade kitne kam bataae jate hai vah ham aap bhi acchhee tarah jaanate hai
 The reality of dengue havoc in Delhi is that the number of patients can be much higher than the government figures
 dilli or ensiaar ke tamaam aspataalon main bhartee marijon kii sankhya kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kuch ilaakon main abhi se marijon ko aspataal main bed kii mushkil hone lagi he
 According to an estimate, the number of dengue patients in Delhi has crossed 5000
 visheshgyon ke mutabik sarkari aankade hakeekat se koso dur hai
 Because in the government statistics, patients who come to unregistered nursing homes are not counted
 aanaade kam bataane se dilli kii hakeekat nahin badalegi, dengue marijon kii sankhya kam nahin hogi, dilli ke logon ke sir se maut kaa khatra kam nahin hoga lekin sarkari koshish ab bhi yahi he ki hakeekat par pardaa daal do
 If the correct figures of patients admitted in private hospitals reach the government and the government pays attention to it, then the dreaded situation will automatically come to the fore
 sarkaar asli khatre se ankhe munde hue he
 In preparation for the Commonwealth Games, dengue mosquitoes have spread the virus of death all over Delhi by thriving in the pit made in Delhi, the Commonwealth Games are also waiting to be stung but the government's intention is to remain unaware of the danger
 It is necessary that you are alert and launch a campaign against mosquitoes

 "medievalism is a form of being irrational, and when we mix it with modern weapons, it becomes a threat to our freedom
" is ecchhatra dharmik niyantrawad ne islam ke dil main khataranaak ghaav kar diya he or aaj hamane paris main iskaa ek dukhad nateeja bhi dekha
 i am with Charley Abdo and we all should be with it so that we can defend the art of satire, which has always been a force of freedom against the power of dishonesty, stupidity and terror
 dharm kaa aadar karo kaa matlab dharm se daro ho gaya he
 Like other ideas, religion should be criticized, sarcastic and yes, without fear of disrespect
 yahaan salmaan rushdi ke bayaan kaa angrezi se hindi main anuwaad isliye kiya he taaki ham paris kii ghatana kii ninda tak hi simit na rahen
 Also bump and raise questions that are being pressed in the name of religious authority
 salmaan rushdi kii is baat ko aap duniya ke kisi bhi desh or us desh ke gali-mohalle main hone vaali bahason main feet kar sakate hai
 The foolish statements made in the name of religious authority in India on the same day are being justified in the name of respect for religion
 aasthaa ke naam par ham puri duniya main ek se ek hinsak anjaam dekh chuke hai
 Faith and respect have made religion far more violent than it has ever been
 ye vahi aasthaa or aadar ke sawaal hai jinke naam par raajnneetik dalon ke log dharmik sanghathanon se samjhauta karte hai
 Assigns them the privilege of their chosen authority
 dharmik sanghathanon ke log raajnneetik dalon ko samjhauta karne ke liye majaboor karte hai
 After all, when did we accept that criticism, satire or question weakened the power of religion
 kyon lagata he ki kisi ke cartoon bana dene yaa gane likh dene se anadar us seemaa tak ho gaya ki dharm kaa vajood sankat main pad saktaa he
 There are good things in every religion of the world and from bad to very bad things
 hamen iskaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 Not only us, people have been doing this for centuries, only then some evils of religion have been overcome
 is par abhi or kaabo paaya janaa he
 Our weak understanding of religion has deepened the line of faith and respect
 itnaa gaharaa kar diya he ki ham iske naam par hone vaali uddandata ko ishwariya maanane lage hai
 We must now understand why religion is causing violence around the world
 dharm ke prati itani bhi nishtha thik nahin he
 Our citizenship and nationality cannot be defined in the name of religion
 koshish to kii ja rahi he, lekin safal nahin hui or safal ho gai to ham sab ek ponga naagarik ban jaaenge jaise karmkaandon ko hi dharm samajhane vaale ko ham ponga pandit kehete hai
 Understand the tricks of fools who dream of establishing the power of religious nation around the world
 apane vivek kii satta ko kisi thekedaar ke hawaale mat kiijie
 The power of religion is challenging us
 dharmon kaa naam badal dijie, lekin iske naam par hone vaali karatuuton main koi antar nahin he
 Somewhere someone is firing a gun in its name, while someone is rioting
 in dangon main garbhvatee mahilaon ke pet tak cheer die gaye hai or logon ko gharon main band kar jala diya gaya he
 a tire has been lit in the throat
 aae din dharm ke naam par diye jane vaale anaap-shanaap bayanon ko aankh dikhaane kii zarurat he
 If faith believes in giving its answer only through violence, then it is necessary that we recognize the dangerous plans of this faith
 isliye dharm par sawaal kiijie
 Satirize paalan or aadar bhi kiijie, lekin isaki swaabhaaviktaa ko itnaa bhi pathar mat bana dijie ki ek din paalan karne vaale kaa hi sir fat jaae
 Religion is the most powerful and unexplored form of our weakness
 yah hamen hamaari sambhaavnon ko simit karne kaa kaam zyada karata he
 For centuries such people have been called Dharmabhiru
 jab dharm kaa aacharan karne vaale dharm bhiruon kii sankhya bad jaati he tab dharm main hinsa paidaa karne kii sambhaavna tej ho jaati he
 That's why be religious, not religion
 rahi baat ek aadar kii to wo koun tay karegaa
 When and where to decide
 yahaan to maamuli aalochanaon par bhi log poster faadane nikal aate hai
 Charley Abdo's cartoons have also been criticized professionally around the world
 iske chhapane na chhapane par hameshaa se kai raay rahi hai
 Many people are of the opinion that these cartoons have been deliberately provocative
 sharli abdo main kai dharmon ke aise cartoon banaae gaye hai
 But this is the best way to criticize it professionally
 kahen ki foohad he
 useless
 nahin chhapane laayak he
 Poor satire
 sadakon par utarkar loktantric tareeke se virodh karnaa he to wo bhi kiijie
 But instead pick up a gun, do violence, and set it on fire, then it is a lousy and irreligious work even than a clumsy cartoon, a clumsy film or dialogue
 hamen ek naagarik ke taur par khud ko taiyaar karnaa chahie ki ham dharm kii sakht se sakht aalochanaon ko sunen or sahan karen
 Otherwise we are nothing more than an organization's useable toy
 dharm kaa istemaal darane or daraane ke liye na ho
 Just as in any democracy the question of questioning makes you a better citizen, in the same way, the rite of disrespect in any religion will make you better religious
 dharm kii satta ishwariya nahin he
 Those who gather power in its name are cosmic
 is jagat ke hai
 Therefore, they will have to answer the questions
 iske naam par isliye dharm kaa bina dare anadar kiijie
 Theater and TV actress Sunita Rajwar has sent a legal notice to Nawazuddin Siddiqui
 sunita ne navaj par unki kitaab 'an Ordinary Life' main unka naam ghaseetne ke liye yah notice bheja he
 In the notice, Sunita demanded an apology from Nawaz within 24 hours, along with a compensation of Rs 2 crore
 bataa den ki navaj ne apni kitaab main sunita ke liye likhaa he ki wo meri pehali garlfriend thim
 i was not successful so they left me
 iske baad mujhe aatmahatya ke khyaal aate the
 Embarrassed by the criticism, Nawazuddin asked for forgiveness, withdrew with his book Sunita, Nawaz also revealed his relationship with actress Niharika Singh in the book
 sunita kaa aarope he ki navaj ne kitaab main unki galat chhavi pesh kii he or unke bare main jhooth bolaa he
 He has shown me like a villain in the book
 mere gharavaalon or sasuraal waalon ko is afaire ke bare main nahin pataa tha
 My personal life has been disturbed after his revelations
 sunita ne navaj ke saath patrkaar rituparna chatarji (jinhone navaj kii kitaab likhane main unki madad kii he) or kitaab ke publisher ko bhi notice bheja he
 'you don't know how to respect women, Nawaz, Ghin aati comes from you' What Nawaz wrote for Sunita in the book, Nawaz took the name of Sunita Rajwar while disclosing the first love in the book
 unhone daawa kiya ki berogari kii vajah se jab unka brallep hua, us vakt wo suicide tak kii sochane lage the
 On this, Sunita wrote a post on Facebook and told that Nawaz has told many lies
 navaj kii chhodane kii asli vajah vah nahin thi, jo unhone bataai
 Sunita has written that Nawaz used to tell our personal, intimate things to his friends and used to laugh
 isliye maine unhen chhod diya tha
 What Sunita had written in the Facebook post says that luck can change, not human nature
 navaj kii kitaab padhakar kuch esa hi laga or yakaayak ‘melaram vafaa’ kaa ek sher yaad aa gaya, “ek baar usne mujhako dekha tha muskuraakar, itani si hakeekat he baaki kahaniyaan hai”
 Because this biography has only been printed to a large extent, not the truth, many things Nawaz has written in his mind, according to his and in his own right, Chit Bhi Meri Pat Bhi Merry Types
 unhone badi hi khubsuurati se khud ko bura bhi kah diya he or utani hi khubsuurati se apni buraai kaa sara thinkara auraton par phod diya he
 Especially on me, because if they believe, after me, their love and trust from women was lost and all their emotions were ripped in RIP
 baharhaal, unki biography main jahaan tak meraa sawaal he to unke jhooth kaa falsafa vahiin se shuru ho jaataa he, jahaan se meraa zikr, yani shuruyaat kii pehali do line se hi, jahaan nawaz kah rahe hai ki wo mujhe enesdy main kabhi nahi mili
 He was my senior one year in NSD, so of course he would have met
 haa us vakt hamaare bich kuch tha nahin, lekin ye kahana ki kabhi mili hi nahin, ye atapata sa zarur lagata he
 4 Disclosures: Aamir Khanfir did not recognize Nawaz, who had worked together 18 years ago, he said that i used to do art work in the walls of his house, carve our names, make hearts, through which we sometimes The arrow also used to pass
 ye padhakar esa laga maano main unase milane nahin, balki unki arts and crafts class lene jaati thi
 The extent was reached when he wrote in a romantic Bollywood movie style that after our break-up he took a bucket of white paint and wiped my art-work off the wall and me with a brush
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki jab maine kabhi koi art-work banaaya hi nahin tha to wo kiske art work ko mitaane kii baat kar rahe hai?chalo in choti-choti baton ko nazar andaaz bhi kiya ja saktaa he, lekin asli khel to unhone vahaan khelaa jahaan hamaare brake-ap kii baat ai
 Nawaz has always been a Sympathy seeker, he does not leave anything from where sympathy can go, sometimes with his complexion, sometimes with poverty, sometimes by saying that he has done the job of Watchman, while the truth is This is that his family background was better than my family background at that time
 ek kaamyaab aadmi ko itnaa insikyor dekhakar kamyaabi se dar sa lagane lagata he kabhi-kabhi
 Well, Nawaz says that he was poor and was a straggler, so i left him
 to nawaz main kya thi, tum se garib to main thi, tum to kam se kam apane ghar main rah rahe the, main to dost ke ghar main rahakar stregal kar rahi thi
 Nawaz takes such a fee for films, told that the actress had a first slap, only you know very well that our relationship started from a play and ended before just three shows of that play, because your truth has come before me
 was
 maine tumhaara phone lenaa chhod diya tha, kyonki ghin aati thi tumhaare bare main sochakar, baat kya karti tumse
 i never said that you focus on your career and i myself
 ab jab tum sab hadein paar kar hi chuke ho to ye bhi jaan lo ki maine tumhen kyon choda tha, maine tumhen isliye choda tha kyonki tum hamaare sambandh kaa mazaaq banaate hue sab vyaktigat baaten hamaare kaaman frends ke saath share kiya karte the
 Then i came to know what you think about woman and love
 doosraa bada jhooth jisane mujhe ye post likhane ke liye majaboor kiya wo ye ki tumhaare safal hone par maine logon ko ye bataanaa shuru kar diya ki kabhi tumhaare or mere gahare sambandh the
 Neither did i say anything to anyone at that time nor did i tell anyone anything till date
 phir itnaa bada jhooth kyon nawaz, agar bahut sachche banate ho to un longo kaa naam bhi chhap dete apni biography main jinke saath main tumhaare hisaab se tumhaare safal hone ke baad hamaare sambandhon kaa bakhaan kiya karti thi
 Such was Nawaz's first film in Miss Lovely, 157 Scenes, that you wrote, "I was your first love, like the first rain in a drought, if it was the first love, God forbid anyone get that first love
" aaj naam he tumhaara, acha kaam kar rahe ho, isliye tab to nahin kaha tha, par ab jarur kahuungi ki apane kariyar par focus karo
 i left you not because of your poverty but because of your poor thinking
 tumne apni biography se sabit kar diya ki main jis nawaz ko jaanati thi tum aaj usase zyada garib ho
 Neither did you know how to respect women then and neither could you learn now
 tumhaare halaat par bas itnaa hi kahuungi, “ ja, tu shikaayat ke kaabil hokar aa, abhi to meri har shikaayat se tera qad bahut chota he”
 
 or haa, main pahaadan nahin, pahaad hum
 
 
 Case filed with Women's Commission: According to media reports, Delhi's lawyer Gautam Gulati filed a complaint against Nawazuddin in the National Commission for Women (NCW)
 ek report ke mutabik, gautam ne apni report main likhaa he ki navaj ne bina ye soche kitaab main in sab baton kaa zikr kiya, jinase peedita mahila ke jivan par bura asar pad saktaa he
 Who is Sunita? Let me tell you that Sunita has appeared in the role of coriander in 'yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai'
 iske saath unhone 'shagun', 'ramayana', 'hitler didi', 'santoshi mata' jaise serials bhi kiye hai
 Sunita is not only seen in serials but also in films
 unhone 'main maadhuri dikshit bananaa chaahati hum', 'ek chaalis kii last local', 'sankat city' jaisi filmon main kaam kiya he
 Surprising pictures of insensitivity of corporation employees have come to light from Rameswaram, one of the major shrines in the country
 saath hi nigam karmiyon or police ke is asamvedansheel ravaiye netirthayatriyon ke prati taiyaariyon ko lekar sawaal khadaa kar diya he
 In fact, after the death of an elderly woman devotee on a pilgrimage to Rameswaram in an accident, the behavior of the corporation workers with her corpse was astonishing
 nigam karmiyon ne bujurg mahila tirthayatri kii laash cokechara vaahan main rakhkahospataal pahunchaaya
 According to the information, 54-year-old Ramamani, a female devotee, had come for the Rameswaram pilgrimage on Amavasya on Thursday
 peedita ramamani odisha kii rahane vaali thim or tirthayatra ke liye rameswaram ai hui thim
 But in Rameswaram on Thursday, he died after being hit by a water tanker
 water tanker se kuchalakar ramamani kii maukey par hi maut ho gai
 But instead of taking the body from the police, the police handed over the responsibility of transporting the body to the hospital
 nigam karmiyon ne bhi shav ke saath puri asamvedansheeltaa dikhaai
 He loaded the dead body of an elderly female pilgrim in a garbage vehicle and brought it to the hospital
 gaur karne laayak baat yah bhi he ki puure pamban jile main sirf do hi shav vaahan hai

 These children said that all the problems are for children aged 13-30 years

 Let us know the statements of Governor Malik which came up for discussion
 
 
 22 oktober 2019: apane bayaan par 3-3 din tak safai deni padati hajammu-kashmir ke rajyapal satyapal malik ne mangalvaar ko kaha tha ki rajyapal rojaanaa baat nahin karata he
 Nor does the press conference
 lekin kai baar mere munh se aisi baaten nikal jaati hai, jinaki mujhe teen-teen din tak safai deni padati he
 Also, it seems that one does not get angry in Delhi
 mangalvaar ko satyapal malik ne ghati ke netaaon par nishaanaa saadhaa or saath hi ye baat bhi kii

 haalanki, apane bayaan par rajyapal malik ne khed jataate hue kaha tha ki unhen aisa nahin kahana chahie tha
 My personal feeling was not like this
 lekin bhrashtachar main duube netaaon or naukarshahon ko dekhakar gusse or hataasha main aisa bayaan de diya tha
 Also read: Satyapal Malik said - Terrorists should kill corrupt leaders instead of policemen bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii party janata dal united (jediu) ne naagarikta sanshodhan bill kaa samarthan kiya he
 This was announced by RCP Singh, the party's MP in Rajya Sabha
 iske thodi der baad hi jediu ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor ne party ke faisle kaa virodh kiya
 He wrote on Twitter, that the JDU leadership should have thought of those who had expressed trust and confidence in the party in 2015 before backing the bill
 While supporting # CAB, the JDU leadership should spare a moment for all those who reposed their faith and trust in it in 2015
 We must not forget that but for the victory of 2015, the party and its managers would not have been left with much to cut any deal with anyone
 — Prashant Kishor (@prashantkishor)december 11, 2019party ke varisht netaa pawan kumaar verma ne bhi party adhyaksh nitish kumaar se is par punarvichaar karne kaa aagrah kiya he
 Party leader Pawan Verma tweeted on Tuesday, writing, "I appeal to Nitish Kumar to reconsider the support of the Citizenship Amendment Bill in Rajya Sabha
" yah bill puri tarah se asanvaidhanik he or desh kii ekta ke khilaaf he
 These bills are also against the original views of JDU
 unhone daawa karte hue kaha ki agar aaj gandhi ji hote to iskaa virodh karte
 Earlier, Prashant Kishore tweeted and expressed his displeasure, writing, "there has been disappointment with jdu's support on the Citizenship Amendment Bill
" yah bill dharm ke aadhaar par naagarikta pradaan karne vaala he, jo bhedbhaav purna he
 Prashant Kishore did not stop here
 unhone party par nishaanaa sadhate hue aage likhaa, jediu kii ore se naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak kaa samarthan party ke samvidhan ke se bhi alag he, jisamen pehle hi panne par dharmanirpekshata shabd teen baar likhaa hua he
 Kishore also lashed out at the party's leader and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, tweeting further that the party's support on the Citizenship Amendment Bill does not match the ideology of the party's leadership, which is inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's views
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main narendra modi ke vijay rath ko uttar pradesh main rokane ke liye samaajawaadee party (SP) or bahujan samaaj party (BSP) ne congress ko darkinar karte hue gathbandhan kaa elaan kiya tha
 After this, the Congress took a big step as Priyanka Gandhi and entrusted him with the responsibility of Purvanchal, making him the General Secretary of the party, after which the politics of the state is changing rapidly
 isi kaa nateeja he ki ab sapa-basapa samjhaute ke mood main najar aa rahi hai or congress ko gathbandhan kaa hissaa bananaa chaahati hai
 If sources are to be believed, the SP-BSP has offered 15 seats to the Congress out of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, but now the party has increased the demand for seats
 congress soobe main kam se kam 25 sansadeey seat chaahati he
 If the Congress leaders are to be believed, then they want the same seats as the SP-BSP in the state
 is tarah se unke lihaaj se teenon partiyaan 25-25 siton par chunaav laden or baaki bachi paanch siten areldi jaisi chote sahyogi dalon ke liye rakhaa jaae
 Let me tell you that last month Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati announced the SP-BSP alliance
 is dauraan unhone soobe kii 80 loksabhaa siton main 38-38 siton par chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya tha
 Apart from this, it was decided to leave two seats for other coalition parties
 vahiin, amethi-raibareli main congress ke khilaaf ummidavaar nahin utaarne kaa faisla kiya tha
 However, after a month has passed, SP-BSP will contest on which seats of the state
 isaki ghoshnaa abhi tak nahin kii he
 Actually Priyanka Gandhi's political entry is being considered behind this
 pichley dinon khabar ai thi ki sapa-basapa nae tareeke se raajnneetik ranneeti banaaenge
 After this, they will distribute seats
 priyanka kii raajnneetik entry ke saath congress ke hausale buland ho gaye hai
 The Congress is projecting Priyanka Gandhi as an incarnation of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
 isse saaf jaahir he ki soobe kii siyaasi ladaai ab do dhruv ke bajaay trikoniya hoti najar aa rahi he
 The way the Congress held a minority conference in Delhi and Rahul Gandhi has raised questions about the 13 point roster to woo the OBC Dalit votes
 usase sapa-basapa main bechaini badhanaa swaabhaavik tha
 In fact, Priyanka seems to be making a dent in the votebank that the SP-BSP alliance is running as its strength
 congress ne jis tarah se muslim votbank, brahman or dalit maton ko lekar apane paale main laane kii kavayad shuru kii he, isse sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke jeet ke mansoobon par pani phir saktaa hai
 This is the reason that churn has started to involve Congress in the coalition
 iskar vibhaag ne lila ram gujjar ke darvaaze par dastak di he

 a day after Priyanka Gandhi's hurt statement about the attacks on her husband Robert Vadra, the BJP said that she (priyanka) wants people to refrain from personal attacks, but the Congress has given Narendra Modi various reasons including his marital status Targeting issues
 is par sahmati jataate hue ki nijee maamlo ko nahin uthaanaa chahie bhaajapa netaa arun jetali ne kaha, eemaandaaree kaa maamla saarvajanik mudda he
 They are not a private issue
 vah wadra ke jameen saudon kii ore ishaara kar rahe the
 Jaitley said that he is happy that Priyanka gave a statement on Vadra and 'I hope his family and his party will take heed of his (priyanka) advice
 unhone kaha ki congress party main priyanka ke mitron se ummid he ki unhen yah ahsaas hoga ki unhone modi par unki shaadi kii sthiti or bina saboot snupaget par jo hamale kiye vah nijee hamale the
 Breaking his silence, Priyanka had said, what do you see when you watch TV? Harsh words, an insult to my family
 mere pati ke bare main bahut-si baaten kahi gai hai
 i feel sad main aahat mahasoos karti hum
 
 
 The truth is not being told
 
 Every day i tell my children that truth will prevail
 
 
 mujhe dukh he ki in chunaavon main kis tarah kii raajnneeti saamne aa rahi he
 He, however, did not name anyone
 unka saaf ishaara bhaajapa dwaara wadra par kiye ja rahe hamalo kii ore tha
 Some BJP leaders said that if the NDA comes to power, Vadra will go to jail
 unhone kaha ki unke pati kaa istemaal unke parivaar par raajnneetik hamale karne ke liye kiya ja rahaa he

 In the IPL, David Warner's bat has made all the bowlers sleepy
 gend kahin bhi ho, kisi bhi ho warner use boundry kaa rasta dikhaane se chookte nahin hai
 Warner not only plays good orthodox shots of cricket in the IPL, but he also plays such a switch hit, reverse sweep in such a great way that the opposing bowler gets upset and he does not understand how fielding for Warner
 Be applied
 keker ke khilaaf dikhaai aakraamakataipiel ke shuruaati maichon main david warner ne kaaphi sanbhalkar ballebaaji kii, unka strike rate itnaa zyada nahin rahaa lekin jaise-jaise toornament aage badha sunrisers hyderabad kaa ye captain aakraamak hota chalaa gaya or kolkata nite rides ke khilaaf 30 april ko khele gaye mukaable main to warner aakraamakata ke charam par pahunch gaye
 Warner scored a century in just 43 balls against Kolkata Knight Riders, scoring an explosive innings of 126 off 59 balls
 kolkata kaa bowling atake ipel kaa sabase majboot atake mana jaataa he lekin warner ne unheen gendbaajon ke khilaaf 8 chakke or 10 chauke laga die
 Warner particularly took on the Kolkata spinners
 spinners ke khilaaf thi khaas ranneetivarner ke paas keker ke spinners se nipatane ke liye khaas plan tha
 He beat spinners like Sunil Narine and Kuldeep Yadav
 spinners ke khilaaf warner ne jabardast reverse sweep or switch shots khele
 Both Kuldeep Yadav and Sunil Narine were shocked to see Warner's shots and did not understand which length and line the bowler had to bowl
 baayen or daaen donon haath se ballebaaji kar sakate hai warneravaise to cricket kii duniya main kai aise ballebaaj hai jo reverse sweep or switch hit laga lete hai lekin warner ne acha in shoton ko or koi ballebaaj nahin kheltaa
 The biggest reason for this is that the left-handed batsman also bats with the right hand
 ji haa jab warner ne 13 saal kii umr main cricket khelnaa shuru kiya tha to us dauraan unke coach ne unhen daaen haath se ballebaaji karne kii salaah di thi kyonki wo baayen haath se ballebaaji karte hue zyaadaatar shots hawa main khelte the
 Mother's advice changed Career Warner batted with the right hand for one season on the advice of the coach, but after this, Warner's mother asked him to bat again with the left hand, after which Warner never looked back

 ' is post ko padhane ke baad sina ke folbers fasebuk par aapas main bhid gaye
 Some people are strongly criticizing Saina and some people are seen standing with Saina
 kisi ne likhaa sina chinis utpaada pramot karnaa band karo
 One wrote, "you are proud of India
 Stop promoting Chinese product
" aapke liye meraa bahut sammaan he or ham sab aapse bahut pyaar karte hai
 Another wrote, "I am a fan of you, but if you say buy a Chinese product, i will not buy
 ” Third wrote Chinese phone is harmful for our country
 chauthe ne likhaa “maine yah phone nahin liya kyonki yah chinis product he or main ek indian phone lenaa chahta hum, ek celibrity hone ke naate aapako yah phone promot nahin karnaa chahie
 "the extent was reached when someone wrote," Stop using China phone, we will hate you till you buy Indian phone
 " '' kisi ne yah bhi likhaa aap desh se badi nahin hai, china product ko bhul jaaie
 Now his Indianness was also questioned
 One wrote, 'once you think you are Indian or Chinese
 ” Although more people were seen standing with Saina
 sina ke ek samarthak ne likhaa “itnaa kathor mat bano, vah ek chinis khel khelti hai, kal ko yah mat bolnaa ki yah game bhi mat khelo yah china kaa game he
 "another supporter of Saina wrote," Many people are anti-national and tell me for your information that the goods you use are also made in China
 aapke smartphone, laptop, modem, yah sab china main bana hua he
 "comments phir kisi ne yah likhaa ki “jo log sina kii china phone istemaal ke liye aalochana kar rahe hai vah bataaen kya fasebuk indian product he, dosto aapkaa fasebuk account niskriy kar do, aap sab desh-virdohi ho jo apane desh ke logon kii aalochana karne ke liye america kaa soshal media istemaal kar rahe ho
 a supporter also wrote that Saina ji always plays like you play and keep moving forward

 The city of dreams, Gurgaon, was completely halted in the last rainy season
 mahaj kuch ghanton kii barish ne shahar kii pramukh sadakon ko 24 ghante se bhi zyada samay ke liye roak diya tha
 Whoever was there was stuck for 5 to 10 hours
 isse jahaan sapanom ke shahar kii haqiqat saamne ai to vahiin itane bade shahar main prashasnic laaparvaahee kii bhi pole khul gai
 This time whether Gurugram is ready for the monsoon, when we reviewed the situation on this, we found that this time too, only preparations have been made in the name of preparations and if a few hours of continuous rain, the situation like last year's Mahajam would be restored
 It won't be late

 The city came to a standstill for a full day in the last rainy season
 mahatraphic jam ne is pragatisheel shahar kii pole khol di
 And the negligence of the administration and the municipal corporation came to the fore
 is baar bhi taiyaariyon ke naam par upree or kagaji kaarywahi hoti dikh rahi he
 Senior Town Planner of Gurugram Municipal Corporation says, 'the main reason for traffic jam in Gurugram is the geographical location here and the number of vehicles growing every day, but this time we are fully prepared and clean the drains along with the roads
 The repair work is also going on loudly
 gudgaanv main aise kai trephic baadhit point hai jahaan offis ower main ghanton jam kii sthiti bani rahati he
 Gurugram Traffic DCP Balbir Singh claims that this time the situation will not be like last time

 Gurgaon is a city where one building is erected every day and the foundation of another is laid

 Here some areas come under Haryana Development Authority ie HUDA, while some of the MCG and major roads on which NHAI work is in progress, NHAI is responsible for cleanliness, water logging and traffic management

 Before comprising a broken road here, the public is confused about the question of who is responsible for their area
 barsaat hote hi gurugram main badhati trephic samasya kaa mukhya kaaran sadakon par hone vaali water loging he or water loging kyon hoti he isko jaanane ke liye hamen isaki bhugaulik sanrachana ko samajhnaa hoga
 - Gurugram mountains have been cut and settled
 - yahaan zyaadaatar ilaake bina kisi planning ke banaaye gaye hai
 - Most townships, sectors and high rising societies do not have sewage and water drainage systems
 - pehle gurugram main kai dam hua karte the jo shaharikaran kii bhent chadh gaye
 Due to being situated at the bottom of the mountains, now the water of the mountains also gets deposited in the cities
 - shahar main pani nikasi kii sahi suvidha nahin hone se pani sadakon par ikattha ho jaataa he
 Where is the highest traffic - By the way, there is always a situation of jam at 23 places in Gurugram
 lekin ye pramukh jagahen hai
 - Rajiv Chowk - Hanuman Chowk - Hero Honda Chowk - IFFCO Chowk - Golf Course Road - Sadar Bazaar - Large pits on roads are common in every area of gurugram
 laaparvaahee kaa alam ye he ki mini sachivalay jahaan shahar ke colector or duusare bade adhikari kaa daftar he uske thik baahar sadaken behaal hai

 In the first phase of Lok Sabha elections, voting will be done in 8 seats of Western UP
 aise main mivati, akhilesh yadav or ajit singh kii sanyukt raily ke liye devband ko chune jane ke myne bhi behad khaas hai
 Even more special are the issues raised during this rally
 maaya, akhilesh or ajit ne notebandi, jiesti se lekar ganna kisaanon or aawaara pashuon kaa mudda uthaaya
 The BSP chief Mayawati, SP president Akhilesh Yadav and Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Chaudhary Ajit Singh shared the stage for the first time at the election rally, saying that the poor, dalits and minorities will jointly teach a lesson to the jumlebars in the election rally
 ganna kisaanon ke nabj par haath rakhane kii koshishashuruyaat ganna kisaanon se karte hai
 Mayawati, while trying to put her hand on the pulse of the sugarcane farmers, said that the bjp's debt waiver and payment of the outstanding sugarcane value proved to be mere jumbo
 main vishwaas dilaanaa chahaati hum ki agar kendra main hamen sarkaar banane kaa mauka mila to sabhi rajyon ko kisaanon kaa koi bhi bakaayaa nahin rakhane ke sakht nirdesh diye jaaenge
 At the same time, Akhilesh Yadav said that the people here produced sugarcane and connected the whole country with sweetness
 aapke kheton main ganna khadaa rahe, magar sarkaar ko koi parvaah nahin he
 The Prime Minister says that the world is proud of our country, but our country is lagging behind in everything
 duniya ke baaki desh aage bad rahe hai, vahiin hamaara desh peeche ja rahaa he
 Attacking modi-yogi under the pretext of stray animals, Mayawati said that the BJP government in UP ruined farmers even more through stray animals
 ganna kisaan bhi pareshaan hai
 At the same time, Ajit Singh said that Modi had said that the price of sugarcane will be Rs 400 per quintal
 mayawati ji or mulaayam singh yadav ji ke shashan main ganna kaa daam kisaanon ko miltaa tha
 Despite the court order today, the government is not paying the sugarcane price
 modi or yogi kisaan kii fasal char rahe hai, so alag
 On demonetisation and GST, mayawati-akhilesh told Modi that demonetisation and GST have increased unemployment
 desh kii arthvyavastha par bura prabhaav padaa he
 Also, corruption has increased
 piem modi kaa zyada samay apane puunjipati doston ko bachaane main gaya
 They kept guarding them
 unhen hi maalamaal karte rahe
 The farmers of the country remained unhappy in this government from the very beginning
 vahiin, akhilesh ne kaha ki hamane dekha ki tivi par pair dhoe ja rahe the, vahiin peeche se dalit bhaiyon kii naukariyaan jaati raheen jiesti se chote kaarobaariyon koi laabh nahin hua
 At the same time, Ajit Singh said that Modi had said before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections that he would give two crore jobs every year
 magar, rojgaar badhanaa to dur, do karod kam ho gaye
 He advises youngsters to make pakodas
 mayawati kaa aarope, desh main aarakshan kota khalidevband raily main iske alaava mayawati ne aarakshan kaa mudda uthaaya
 Mayawati alleged that like the previous Congress government at the Center, the present BJP government did not develop any special development for Dalits, backward, Muslims and other religious minorities
 puure desh main aarakshan kaa kota khaali padaa he
 First the Congress and now the BJP governments have provided work to the Dhannaseths only by working through the private sector without providing reservation in the private sector

 a Song to Remember (1945) abhinetri vidya baalan maanati hai ki vah geetkaar va kahanikar gulzaar se puri tarah prabhavit hai
 Vidya says that she became familiar with Urdu literature only because of Gulzar
 gulzaar ke saath unki nai elbum 'tera bayaan gaalib' jari karte hue vidya ne kaha ki main gulzaar sahab ke chalate urdu sahitya se parichit hui
 i saw him reading the Karadi Tales at the Kalaghoda Festival a year ago
 maine jo dekha or suna usase main bahut prabhavit hui or maine urdu sahitya main bhi ruchi lenaa shuru kar diya
 Vidya said that for me Gulzar is the only person in front of whom i become silent
 vishaal bharadwaj unhen bahut khubsuurati se 'safed sufi' bulaate hai
 The album contains the letters and poems of Shair Ghalib, which Gulzar has read
 gaalib kii gajalen ghazal gayak jagajeet singh kii aawaaj main hai
 Talking about Jagjit Singh, Vidya said that for every person of my generation, Ghazal means Jagjit Singh and Urdu literature means Gulzar
 gaalib ko ham tak koi nahin pahunchaa sakaa tha lekin bhartiya samskruti kii in donon hastiyon ne hamaara unase parichay karaayaa
 Gulzar produced the TV serial 'mirza Ghalib' in 1988
 abhinayta nasiruddin shah ne gaalib kii bhoomika nibhaai thi

 Once the desire of the drug did not cause sexual desire for several days
 matlab yahaan marij taiyaar karne kaa kaam kiya jaataa tha, jinhen ilaaj kii jarurat ho

 jaahir he jab logon kaa ghar tuutane kii naubat aati to ve is dawa ko kharidte, or is tarah asaram kaa yah dhandha chalata rahata
 In the Surat ashram of Asaram, a drug named Sapta Dhatuvardavar Booti was being sold
 food and drug vibhaag ko shaq he ki in dawaaon main aise rasayanon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he jisaki ijajaat nahin di gai he
 Read - When the food and drug department of Asaram Sundar raided the Jodhpur court raided Asaram Ashram in Jahangirpura, it found not only the powerful medicines, but also 5 other medicines in which the chemicals used were not allowed
 un dawaaon ke naam hai- baan booti, trifala tablet, aanwala churna, kaph sirf or rasayan tablet
 Read how the God of hypocrisy got the air Gulfood and Drugs Department has sent samples of suspected drugs from the ashram for investigation
 agar bina ijaajat vaali rasayanon kii baat sabit hoti he to baba kii mushkilen bad sakati hai
 However, questions are arising as to what is the point of selling potency enhancers in ashrams run for satsang? Asaram is accused of sexually abusing a minor girl
 unke bete narayan sai rape ke aarope ke baad chah dinon se faraar hai
 The wife and daughter are accused of threatening the girls for not voicing them
 uttarakhand main ai bheeshan aapadaa ko do saal ho gaye hai, lekin maanav sharir ke avasheshon kaa milanaa ab bhi jari he
 Recently the remains of a human foot have been found in the rubble of the ruins of a broken building

 Singh said that more than 600 people whose remains were found and cremated at Kedarghati were found on the surface
 mandir ke aas-paas ab bhi 50-60 feet oonchamalabe kaa dherhai or koi hairat kii baat nahin he ki uske neeche kuch or bhi mil jaae
 He said that first one floor of the buildings has been buried under the rubble and now that the local people have been allowed to clear the debris from their buildings, then the possibility of getting something else cannot be ruled out

 ' In the bouncer Deepak Tandon death case at Elf Cafe & Bar located in Hauz Khas area of delhi, his father has alleged that he has been murdered
 mritak ke pita gulshan tandon kaa kahana he ki deepak ne baar main punjabi gaanaa chalaane ko kaha tha
 After this the quarrel started there
 iske baad bear kii bottle markar uski hatya kar di gai
 Police sent Deepak's body for postmortem

 Deepak Tandon, a bouncer by profession, arrived in Delhi on the morning of 31 December with two of his friends
 ludhiana se nikalate samay usne fasebuk par ek photo post kii thi
 After this, Deepak reached Delhi and shared many photos on Facebook even while walking in Connaught Place, Palika Bazaar

 His death brought with him so many questions, which the Delhi Police are sweating to solve
 police deepak kii maut kii gutthi ko sulajhane kii jitani koshish kar rahi he wo utani hi ulajhati ja rahi he
 The pub's staff and Deepak's friends and family are making different claims
 pub staff ke mutabik deepak ne khud ke sir par bear kii bottle maari thi
 He died because of that
 parivaar bottle maarane kaa aarope pub ke bounsar par laga rahe hai
 Deepak's friend Vikram, who was present on the spot at the time of the incident, is saying that a bouncer hit a beer bottle on Deepak's head
 haalanki, wo ye nahin bataa paa rahaa he ki aakhir jhagada kis baat par hua tha
 Where and what he was doing at that time
 police sutron kaa kahana he ki deepak ne khud bottle apane sir par maari he
 Deepak had a fight with the DJ over singing
 tab use pub se baahar kar diya gaya tha, lekin wo baad main phir se pub main daakhil ho gaya or jhagada karne laga
 During this quarrel, he hit a beer bottle on his head
 deepak ke pita ko ye ek sajeesh lagati he
 He says that his son was killed for playing a Punjabi song
 pichley saal congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii ek jeevani surkhiyon main ai thi
 'the Red Sari'
 spanish lekhak jevier moro ne isamen gambhirtha se bataaya tha ki sonia or rajeev kii shaadi kaise hui
 Now there is another book 'nidar a hoque nor a dav'
 Former Pakistan Foreign Minister Khurshid Kasuri has spoken about Sonia Gandhi's witty style in this book
 kasuri ne likhaa he ki sonia ne ek baar unase majaak main kaha tha ki unhone rajeev se isliye shaadi kii, kyonki vah khubasurat yuvak the
 Kusuri has written about the meeting, referring to the visit of the then Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf to India in 2005 in the book
 tab musharraf se milane ai sonia kii agavaani kasuri ne hi kii thi
 Soniaksuri was serious before the meeting, wrote that Sonia looked very serious when she came to meet Musharraf
 mujhe laga main unke chehre par muskaan bikher saktaa hum
 i made a reference to him
 
 
 
 And hearing this, Smileshinkuri wrote, i told Sonia a story
 jab main cambridge main tha or sohail iftikhar (nehru ke dost or congress netaa miyaan iftikharauddin ke bete) ke saath tahal rahaa tha to maine kings parade par saamne se ek khubasurat yuvak ko aate dekha
 i asked Sohail who he is, so he told that he is Rajiv, Pt
 jawaharlal nehru kaa naati
 Sonia smiled and said - that's why i married her
 bharat-paak match kaa kissakasuri ne likhaa he ki jab ham firozshah kotla maidan main pahunche, sonia gandhi or videsh mantri natwar singh vahaan pehle se maujuud the
 Shahid Afridi's name was being taken aloud in the presence of Pakistanis
 mujhe laga ki afridi ke balle se nikali genden hamaari taraf aa rahi thim
 On this, Natwar Singh said in a funny way, you also take Afridi with you
 style or kaabiliyat ke maamle main sachin tendulkar kaa pratidwandvi west indies ke bryan lara ko hi mana jaataa he
 For two decades, critics have been mulling over these questions, who is better, and what is the difference between the two in terms of technique, start of innings and mental strength
 lara ne ajtak ke khel sampadak vikrant gupta ko bataaya ki unamem or sachin main kya bhinnataayen hai
 Excerpts from the conversation: What would you like to say about the start of the innings and your mental state after that? How different is it from Sachin? i have been practicing vigorously before a match
 mere vichaar se is maamle main meraa or sachin kaa ravaiya ek jaisaa he
 Michael Jordan once said that they prepare so hard that during the game they feel everything under control
 unke liye kuch bhi aparichit nahin rahata, sab kuch sahaj ho jaataa he
 In the middle of the innings, i used to dominate the bowling and win the addiction
 meri samaj main sachin iske vipareet gendbaajon ko kuch over dekar sahi vakt par dhunaai karne main yakeen rakhte hai
 That is, my method is more explosive
 aapaki style—jaise, khadey hone kii bhangima, baclift, stroke main vividhta, pari ke bich main achaanak tej yaa maddhim ho janaa vagairah—duusare gendbaajon ke mukaable itani alag kaise he?main gend par tagada prahaar karne ke liye balle ko teji se baclift karata hum
 i use footwork more against spinners in the Indian subcontinent
 main aaraam se khadaa rahane kii koshish karata hum or gend par tut padane kii bajaae use balle par aane detaa hum
 Sachin also uses legs more
 ve apane tareeke se gendbaajon par kaabo pate hai, unke shot mujhase zyada paaramparik hote hai
 You had the unique ability to play big innings
 kaise aap itane ghanton tak ekaagratha banaae rakhte the?maine jab pehla test shatak lagaaya to rohan kanhai vahaan the
 He complimented me but suddenly he came to me and said that concentrate more and make a big score
 tab se main hameshaa bade score par dhyaan lagaataa rahaa
 Would you have changed your style if you were in the Indian team with Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Saurabh Ganguly and VVS Laxman? And on the contrary, what would Sachin do if he were in the West Indies? i don't think so
 mere liye ballebaaji team ke liye ran batorna rahi he
 i don't think playing in any team would change my style
 lekin in khiladinnon ke rahete apni jagah banane ke liye kadi pratispardhaa kerani padati
 i say jokingly but it is not completely meaningless that Sachin would have had ease in the West Indies team
 vah koun-si ek cheez aap sachin se siikhnaa chaahate or sachin aapse?main unki tarah shant chitt hokar khelnaa sikhta
 They never panic or get bored
 sachin shaayad mere jaisaa swaabhaavik khel siikhnaa chaahate
