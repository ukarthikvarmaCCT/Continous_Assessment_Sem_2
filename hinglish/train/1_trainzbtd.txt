 Let's prepare the recipe for victory in the triangular battle
 ye chaaron bijepi ke liye jamini raajnneeti kii takat or sushasan ke sufal kaa anokhaa mail sabit ho rahe hai
 The story of those who are likely to suffer defeat is to lose the same old credentials and suffer from the boredom (anti-incumbency) of staying in power for a long time, and of course, they are also facing the brunt of Manmohan being a Congress leader in the fall
 Huh
 jaisaa nateezon se pataa chalata he ki yah janamat surveykshan kursi par baithe or unhen chunauti dene waalon ke bare main raishumaari he
 Every state will vote for change in its own way, but this does not necessarily mean that the person sitting on the chair changes, as is the case with Madhya Pradesh and neighboring Chhattisgarh
 madhya pradesh main kareeb 60 pratishat log shivaraj singh chouhan ko phir gaddi par dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Chauhan became the Chief Minister in 2005, replacing Babulal Gaur
 2004 ke baari pherbadal vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main uma bharti ne congress kaa garh bhed kar bhopal ke shamla hills par bhagava dhvaj laharaaya tha
 That year, the fiery Sanyasini of Madhya Pradesh and the invincible queen in Rajasthan provided additional oxygen to the Sangh Parivar
 lekin bharti kii teji janadesh ko sambhaal kar rakhane ke aade aa gai or unke uttaradhikari babulal gaur behad sust sabit hue
 After all, Shivraj Singh Chauhan expanded the base
 khantee sangh pariwari chouhan kabhi hindu samskruti kii yaad dilaanaa nahin bhoolatey
 He had both the ability and the credibility to become the flag bearer of Hindutva
 unhone badi jaldi yah jaan liya ki gopuja (unhone govadh par pabandi lagaai) or surya-namaskara (jise skulon main anivaary kiya) se hi ve 21veen sadi ke bazaar mulya vaale netaa nahin ban paaenge
 Chauhan's achievements in agriculture and power are unmatched, but he has cleverly understood the importance of social capital in the politics of development
 aankade isaki gavaahi dete hai
 More than 60 percent of the voters in the age group of 18 to 40 years want to see him again and 65 percent of the college-educated are like him
 matadaataaon ke is varg kii pasand gaayon ke rakshak chouhan nahin, balki aadhuniktaa ke pairokaar chouhan hai
 Although he is still a grassroots leader, his personality is not flamboyant but simplicity, his appeal is quintessential
 aaj bijepi ko aise hi janaadhar vaale sthaneey netaaon se badhat mil rahi he
 Another such leader is Raman Singh of Chhattisgarh who is considered durable and reliable
 unhen desh ke sambhawatah sarvaadhik jokhim vaale rajya main 52 pratishat log teesraa kaarykaal dena chaahate hai, jahaan maovadi desh kii aantarik suraksha par bhram kii sthiti kaa laabh uthaakar khooni khel rahe hai
 And perhaps this is the reason why despite the high graph of popularity of the Chief Minister, 58 percent people do not support the government's methods in dealing with Maoism
 prashasan main raman prabhaav unke ek rupye kilo chaaval jaisi yojanaon ko sabase garib tabakon ko muhaiyaa karaane main dikhataa he, jo khaadya suraksha kaa unka vikalp he
 Raman Singh, the first elected Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, is still working with utmost courage
 rajasthan main mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne vaapasi ke liye koi kasar nahin chodi he
 He has put up a flurry of populist programs but his plans hardly come in the way of Rani's return: 52 per cent of the people there want change
 gahalot ne mahaj paanch saal main rajasthan ko aise rajya main tabdeel kar diya he, jahaan 45 pratishat log sarkaar kii sabase badi naakaami mahilaon ke prati aparaadh dar kaa baduya maanate hai
 Gehlot's plan to give saris to the poor could hardly change this perception
 rani ne kaaphi jameen taiyaar kar lee he
 In 2004, Vasundhara Raje won a landslide victory with 120 seats, like a desert storm
 2014 main unki vaapasi kii muhim bhi 2004 kaa vah khushnuma daur waapas paane or 2008 ke apmaan kaa badla lene kii ladaai he
 He had missed the opportunity to stand in the pantheon of unbeatable leaders, who have currently acquired Modi, Chauhan and Raman
 janamat surveykshan bataata he ki rani duusari shuruyaat karne ke kagaar par khadi hai
 The survey results do not give a fourth term to the Congress's most durable chief minister
 dilli kii trikonatmak ladaai main ab bhi shila dikshit ko hi jeetna yaa haarana he, lekin achaanak arvind kejariwal ke maidan main aa jane se najaara or phija donon badal gai he
 The BJP has also gone beyond the caste-based and region-specific leaders, a fresh Chief Ministerial candidate, Dr
 harshavardhan ko lekar aage ai he
 The poll results give 46 seats to BJP, 22 to Congress and 8 to Aam Aadmi Party, but Sheela still remains the ideal Chief Minister's choice for Delhiites
 ve ab bhi shahar kii sahaayta karne vaali ammi hai
 If there were time, she could have been Modi of the Congress, but she is in the era of Manmohan and is facing the brunt of being in this phase, and to some extent, boredom caused by constant sighting of Sheela is a reason
 yah daur kisi congress netaa ke liye acha nahin he or jaisaa ki lagaataar kai janamat surveykshanon se jaahir ho rahaa he, modi kii rashtravyapee apil ne bhagava birdari ko vidhansabha chunaavon main atirikt badhat dilaa di he
 In Indian politics today, Modi is a symbol of the truth that power is moving from the center to the provinces
 narendra modi kaa myth gujarat ke behtareen prashasan vaale rajya hone ke record se bana he
 Different forms of Gujarat are seen in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 bijepi ke centre main bhale netaaon ke bich markat dikhi ho magar uske kshatrapon ne apana garh bachaae rakhane ke liye athak parishram kiya he
 Nothing like this was seen in Congress
 centre kamjor he or rajya ke netaa usase bhi tanbehaal
 These four states have 72 Lok Sabha seats
 so, 2014 kii garmiyon main in rajyon se nikle maharathi desh kii gaddi kii ladaai main modi ke sipahasaalar banenge
 The retaliatory actions of Rahul Gandhi will be settled alone
 aise daur main jab ghabaraai sarkaar janamat surveykshanon par pabandi lagane kii yojana bana rahi he, chunaav vigyaan kaa bahu-vivaadit shaastra us sachaai kii ore ishaara kar rahaa he ki desh us party ko maaf karne ke mood main nahin he jisane use nicha dikhaaya, or vah bhagava rang main rangane ko taiyaar he
 In Palam area of delhi, a sensational case of rape by an elderly student with an 8th class minor student has come to light

 shikaayat milane ke baad bhi police karrwai na karke maamle ko rafa dfa karne main lagi he
 After this, people created a ruckus outside the police station
 philhal ghatana ke 10 ghante biit jane ke baad police ne cese maamla darj kar liya he
 Let us tell you that earlier, a 60-year-old elder with a mentally weak girl in the floor market area of the capital had committed the rape

 From the beginning of Facebook, it has been a policy that it starts many features in the Facebook app first and then removes the feature from the app by launching a special app for it
 aise main yugers ko majaboor hokar fasebuk kaa banaaya hua ap yuj karnaa hota he jisase use kaaphi phayda hota he
 The latest example of this is Facebook's photo sharing app Moments, for which the company has decided to remove the photo sync feature from the mobile app
 fasebuk jaldi hi apane mobile ap se photo sinc feechar khatm kar degaa
 Through this feature, there is an option to sync your gallery photos to Facebook
 apane nae ap ko pramot karne ke liye fasebuk apane ap se hataata he kai fichrais feechar ko khatm karne ke peeche fasebuk kaa apana hit he, kyonki company ab logon ko apana 'moments' ap yuj karana chaahati he
 Earlier this year, Facebook launched a special photo sharing and sync app 'moments' which was not given due consideration by the users
 fasebuk ne iske liye yugers ko yah bataanaa shuru kiya he ki 10 janvari ke baad se jinhen apane phone se privetali photo share karnaa he, ve fasebuk ke khaas ap Moments yuj kar sakate hai
 Earlier Facebook launched the Messenger app, but users used to message each other from the Facebook app itself
 is vajah se massenger ap main logon ne dilchaspee nahin lee
 But Facebook removed the messaging feature from its mobile app, so that users had to download the messenger app even when they did not want to
 iske alaava aise kai udhaaharan he jab yah company apane nae ap ke liye fasebuk ap se feechar hataa detii he
 In this, Facebook has launched a special app for its page, which people are using without even wanting

 In late 2015, Xiaomi launched a smartphone
 naam tha Mi MIX
 As soon as the smartphone was launched, it made headlines worldwide
 vajah ye thi ki yah tradishnal smartphone se kaaphi alag tha
 It had little bezels and only the display was visible
 ise tab sirf concept ke taur par launch kiya gaya, lekin ise aasaani se yuj kiya ja saktaa tha
 After the launch of this smartphone, companies started to launch low-cost smartphones
 baari ai phir se shaomi kii to company ne haal hi main MI MIX kaa aglaa or stable vairient yani Mi MIX 2 ko china main launch kiya
 After a month, it has now been launched in India too and its sales will start from the first week of November
 rivyuu ke liye main Mi MIX 2 ko hafte bhar se istemaal kar rahaa hum
 This smartphone is tested in many ways
 aaie ab jaanate hai iskaa rivyuu
 Design and build quality: This smartphone is clearly different from others, because it does not use only metal or plastic
 isamen metal ke frem ke saath back main siremic kaa istemaal kiya gaya he jo ise premium banaata he
 It gives a premium feel for viewing, using and holding
 iske chaaron kinare karvd hai, isliye badi disple hone ke baavjood hold karnaa ise kaaphi aasaan he
 There are only a few smartphones in the world in which such a ceramic design has been given
 back panel jo siremic kaa he ye vaaki shandaar he or isamen camera ring diya gaya he jo 18K gold he
 The back panel reads Mix Design by Xiaomi
 siremic hone kii vajah se aap iske back panel main mirar kii tarah khud ko aaraam se dekh sakate hai
 Antenna lines are nowhere to be seen, only they appear on the frame
 camere ke badal main flash modul he jise company agar panel ke andar detii to kamaal hota
 but it's not like that
 camere ke neeche fingerprint scinar diya gaya he jo kaaphi fast he
 Due to the full display, sensors will not appear on the top of the display like a normal smartphone
 tamaam sensors andar kar die gaye hai, 
 Even the earpiece has been moved inwards so that at least bezel and more display can be given
 neeche kii taraf do spikar gril he or yuasabi tip si port he
 The headphone jack is not provided, but for this comes a connector in the box through which any headphone can be connected to it
 is smartphone kaa back fingerprint magnet kii tarah kaam karata he or jaise hi ise haath main lenge yaa tach karenge aapaki fingerprints dikhne lagengi or dust bhi jaldi aate hai isapar
 The good thing about the design is that it does not slip by hand
 haalanki company iske saath ek back cover bhi detii he to jo kaaphi behtareen he or aap ise istemaal kar sakate hai
 This smartphone has impressed us in terms of build quality and design
 aaj kal saste se lekar mahange smartfones main companiyaan yaa to metal de rahi hai yaa glass metal kaa yuj kiya ja rahaa he
 But Xiaomi has come up with a ceramic designed smartphone designed with famous designer Philippe Starck
 displeiani MIX 2 main 6 inch kii alsidi disple di gai he jo phul echdi he or iskaa rijolushan 1080x2160p he
 Most of the front panel is the display itself
 picksal prit inch kii baat karen to ye 402 he isliye alsidi disple hone ke baavjood dekhne main scran acchhee lagati he
 But still if Xiaomi had it like Quad HD or as we saw the OLED panel in Galaxy Note 8, then it would have made the smartphone go green, but alas it is not so
 baharhaal isaki disple aapako niraash to nahin hi karegi or sharp image dikhenge
 The viewing angle is also good and bright
 suraj kii raushnee main bhi aap ise dekh sakate hai
 Believe it or not, if such a display was in any other smartphone, then we do not tell it better
 lekin MI MIX 2 ke saath aisa nahin he
 If you talk about watching videos or gaming, then it is real fun
 kyonki bejal nahin he disple par or aap phul screen main video dekhte hai or gaming karte hai to ye anubhav kamaal kaa he
 Qualcomm's flagship processor Snapdragon 835 has been installed in the performance Mi MIX 2
 isamen 6GB ram he or isaki internal memory 128GB kii he
 We will not discuss any benchmark or any theory in this review
 ham bhartiya customers ke lihaaj se baat karenge ki asal jindagi main yah kya kamaal dikhaa paata he
 i am more interested in computer gaming and have played all of the Call of Duty series games
 is smartphone main maine kai din sirf gaming hi kii, kol of duty to nahin, lekin shooting game khelaa he jisaki graphics kaaphi heavi he
 Gaming has zero lag and the phone is slightly warm
 multi tasking main yah phone master nahin he, flagship procesar hone ke baavjood
 Probably because of Xiaomi's own operating system
 lekin ap swimming main koi pareshaani nahin hoti
 The phone stopped responding for a few minutes for 10 consecutive days for 10 to 20 seconds
 parformens ke maamle main ham ise 10 main 10 bilkul nahin de sakate hai, lekin daily life main ek saadhaaran yujar jitna smartphone se ummid karata he utani parformens yah bakhubi detaa he
 To write a camera, there are many things in its camera
 daise isamen 12 megapixl kaa 4 axis optical image stebligeshan vaala camera diya gaya he
 It has Sony IMX386 sensor whose aperture f / 2
 0 he
 It has face detection autofocus and dual LED flash
 isame diya gaya camera ring 18K gold plated he
 f / 2 in it for selfie
 0 aparchar kaa 5 megapixl kaa front camera diya gaya he
 In daylight you can click good pictures from it, but don't expect much detailing then it would be better
 aap niraash ho sakate hai
 However, detailing is good if the proper light is there
 kam raushnee main iskaa camera prabhavit nahin karata he
 Overall, you cannot put its Camaro on the scale of the iphone 8 or Galaxy Note 8, so the camera is not great for this range, but it does not disappoint either
 selfi lene main aapako dikkat ho sakati he, kyonki front camera upar nahin balki neeche kii taraf diya gaya he
 This is because there is no room for the camera due to lack of bezel
 isliye front camera neeche he or aap jaise hi selfi camera open karenge to aapako sidhi selfi lene ke liye phone ko ulta karnaa hoga
 Battery backup Mi MIX 2 has a 3,400mah battery with Qualcomm Quick Charge 3
 0 saport diya gaya he
 That is, it has fast charging
 aadhe ghante main 45 fisadi tak charge ho jaataa he
 Although 1 in full charge
 5 ghante lagenge
 But it can run comfortably throughout the day
 massenger, fasebuk, colling or surfing karke 12 ghante tak ise aaraam se chalaaya ja saktaa he
 If you want to do gaming, then you have to charge it in half a day
 agar aapkaa bajet ijaajat detaa he to ye smartphone aapke liye phaayde kaa sauda hoga
 Because there are many factors that differentiate it from other smartphones in this segment

 Former Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist has said that he is not in favor of landing four fast bowlers on Waka, despite the pace bowlers having a helpful pitch
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vah ek spinner ko jarur utaarte haalanki unke daur main austrailia ke paas shen warn jaisaa mahaan spinner tha
 Australia and India will face here in the third Test from Friday
 is baat ko lekar bahes garm he ki austrailia ko hari bhari pich par chaar tej gendbaajon ko utaarna chaiye yaa ek spinner ko bhi
 Gilchrist said, "it was easy to balance because Australia had a spinner like Shane Warne at that time
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘vah har sthiti main acha pradarshan karata tha
 That is why it is difficult for me to give my opinion in the current situation
 shen watasan ke bina is team main santulan bana paanaa mushkil he
 The work of fast bowlers will increase so a spinner is necessary
 ’ purv ballebaaj tam mudi ne haalanki kaha ki vaaka par tej gendbaajon kii hi tuuti bolegi
 He said, 'four fast bowlers are a good option
 austrailia ke maamle main yah or madadgaar he kyonki ben hillphenhas kaa rabip chota he or vah over jaldi samaapt kar sakate hai
 Moody said, "for the last few tests, we are watching his timing and he completes the over in two and a half to three minutes
 vaaka par kamyaabi kii kunjee sahi gendbaaji sangyojan rahaa he
 He said, 'I have heard that this wicket will be as fast as ever
 pichley kuch saal main is par raftaar or oochaal badhi he jisase hamaare tej gendbaajon ko madad milegi
 "moody believes that the batsmen should get down on the waka with positive thinking as the chances of mistake for the bowlers will be very less
 unhone kaha, ‘tej, uchhalbhre wicket ballebaaji ke liye bhi achche hote hai kyonki isse shaat khilne main bhi madad milti he
 You can either think of it as difficult for the batsmen to climb negative and Everest or get down with positive thinking

 He has taken this step to punish Beijing for 'improperly' confiscating US intellectual property
 america raashtrapati ke is kadam se donon deshon ke bich jari tanaav ke or adhik badhane kii ashanka he
 After a seven-month investigation into the intellectual property theft case, Trump has asked the US Trade Representative to impose a $ 60 billion tariff on imports from China
 trump ne kaha ki hamen bauddhik sampada kii chori kii bahut badi samasya kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, yah hamen adhik majboot, adhik sampann desh banayega
 China, on the other hand, is stunned by the US decision
 china ne america ke is kadam kaa kadaa jawaab dene kii baat kahi he
 In response to Trump's decision, China may increase tariffs on other goods, including US pork, aluminum
 saaf he ki trade ke maamle main ab donon desh aamane-saamne hai
 Let us tell you that before this, the decision was taken by the Trump administration to increase the import duty on many other goods including steel and aluminum
 america ke is faisle se ek baar phir duniya par trade waar kaa khatra mandaraane laga he
 What is trade war? Trade war means the fight of trade is the result of protectionism between two countries
 yah sthiti tab paidaa hoti he, jab koi desh kisi desh se aane vaale saamaan par tarriff duty badhaata he
 In response to this, the front country also starts increasing duty
 zyaadaatar samay par duniya kaa koi bhi desh yah kadam tab uthaata he, jab vah apni gharelu industry or companiyon kaa sangrakshan karne ke liye kadam uthaata he
 The effect of this trade war is gradually visible on the whole world
 isaki vajah se vaishvik str par kaarobaar ko lekar chintaa kaa maahaul taiyaar ho jaataa he
 Had already given warnings, let me tell you that Trump had already warned countries like India and China about this
 unhone pehle kaha tha ki agar america saamaanon par tex kam nahin kiya gaya to ve bhi utana hi tex lagaayenge
 Trump said that the US levies very little tax on goods imported from other countries, but other countries levy more tax on our goods
 trump ne dhamkee bhare lahaze main kaha ki duusare desh tex kam nahin karenge to ham bhi javaabi tex lagaayenge

 - input language kamedi ke diggaj sunil grover (sunil Grover) aksar apane kairactor or acting se logon ko hansaate or unka khub manoranjan karte aae hai
 Sunil Grover as 'gutthi', 'doctor Gulati' and 'santosh Bhabhi' not only made a lot of headlines, but also made a different identity for himself
 in sabake alaava sunil grover (sunil Grover) ne salmaan khan ke saath film 'bharat' main bhi shandaar acting kii thi
 But Sunil Grover's journey from TV to Bollywood was not easy
 apane kariyar ke shuruaati samay main unhen kai mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Not only this, Sunil Grover used to earn only 500 rupees a month in the initial period
 in baton kaa khulaasa khud unhone soshal media blog oficial humons bombai ke blog ke sahare kiya
 “I was always good at acting & making people laugh
 i remember in 12th grade i took part in a drama competition–the chief guest said that i shouldn't participate, because it was unfair to the others! After i finished my masters in theatre, i came to Mumbai to act
 But for the first year, i only partied
 i lived in a posh area, using my savings & some money from home
 I'd only earn around Rs
 500 a month
 But i thought I'd be successful soon
 Eventually i realised that there were many like me, who were ‘superstars' of their town & ‘strugglers' here
 Soon i had no income & was given a harsh reality check
 i was demotivated
 But i remembered how my dad wanted to be a radio announcer & even had an offer
 But because my granddad was against it, he had to work at a bank & regretted it
 i didn't want to let my dreams go
 So i picked up the pieces & rigorously looked for work
 But the road was still rocky
 Once I'd been selected to act in a TV show–we'd even shot for a few days
 But when i stopped getting my time to come on set, i called the team – they said I'd been replaced
 At the same time i also started getting work in voiceovers
 So when I'd be rejected from TV & films, i had a cushion to fall back upon – something that most didn't have
 i realised how fortunate i was & regained my strength bit by bit
 Around that time, i got offered to do a radio show
 It was only going to be aired in Delhi, but when that show went live, it went viral! They decided to air it across India! After that, i got work in radio, TV & films
 Soon 'gutthi' happened & in no time, became a household name! i remember i was called on a live show & when i went on stage, the audience was roaring for me! i turned to make sure there wasn't anyone else, whom they were clapping for – but it was all for me
 It took several moments like that, to bring back that young boy in me, who used to think that he could conquer the world
 The young boy who used to make sure that everyone around him was smiling & entertained
 The young boy who didn't let failures dim his dreams & overpower his need for victory
 So even though I've come this far
 
 
 this young boy has a long way to go

 uttar pradesh main yogi sarkaar kaa ek saal puraa hone ke uplakshya main yojit hone vaale jalse kaa shaamiyana upachunaav parinaamon kii aandhi main ukhd gaya he
 The Yogi government, which came to power with a thumping majority a year ago, is completing one year on March 19, but just four days before this, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has been given a big blow by the people of UP
 do siton ke upachunaav main bijepi mukhyamantri or upmukhyamantri donon kii seat ganvaa baithi
 The defeat of these two seats is looking heavy on all the electoral successes achieved in recent times
 gorakhpur or phulpur kii seat par hue upachunaav main bijepi ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaahai
 SP candidates have won both the seats
 haalanki is chunaav main samaajawaadee party ko bahujan samaaj party kaa samarthan mila tha
 Let us tell you that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and the UP assembly elections, the BJP had defeated the SP and the BSP
 loksabhaa main bijepi ko 80 main se 71 siton par jeet mili thi, jabaki vidhansabha kii 403 siton main se bijepi ko 312 siten milin
 The SP got 47 seats while the BSP got just 19 seats
 jeet ke baad mukhyamantri bane yogi adityanath ne kanoon vyavastha se lekar gau raksha ke mudde par jamkar abhiyaan chalaaya
 At the same time, to curb the criminals, Yogi gave the police a free hand and started encounters everyday in the state
 yogi sarkaar ne mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh ko rokane ke liye anti romeo abhiyaan chalaaya
 On almost every occasion, the Yogi government took credit for it on every platform and talked about better law and order in the state

 The Yogi government organized Diwali in Ayodhya to promote tourism in the state, and played Holi in Mathura

 The government claimed that after the BJP government came to power in UP, roads have been built in the state and electricity supply is becoming abundant

 haalanki yahaan bhi yogi sarkaar par aankadon main herapheri karne or chizon ko badha-chadhaakar dikhaane ke aarope lage, lekin yogi apane hi andaaj main chal rahe the
 Before the by-election results, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had said that he would put his report card before the public after the completion of one year of the government, but the defeat in Gorakhpur and Phulpur has spoiled the report card of Yogi Adityanath
 yogi apni hi seat nahin bachaa paae hai, to party ko upmukhyamantri keshav prasad maurya kii seat par bhi haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 After the election results, Yogi Adityanath admitted that the party's over-confidence overshadowed the by-election
 yogi kii is sweekaarokti ke baad sabakuch spasht ho jaataa he
 Neither good days have come in UP in the last one year
 or na hi raamarajy basaa he
 As the Chief Minister has been claiming and the biggest proof of this is the result of Lok Sabha by-election
 bijepi kaa sheersh netritv loktantr main chunaav jeetne ke mahatv ko samajhataa he
 Yogi has lost his seat, which is also the center of his politics
 upmukhyamantri keshav prasad maurya kii seat bhi sapa ne kabja lee he
 It has to be seen how Narendra Modi and Amit Shah take this defeat

 ' sikh samudaay ke log dharm or jati ke naam par bhedbhaav nahin kar saktemuslim anya deshon main bhale hi bahusankhyak hai lekin bharat main alpsankhyakanaagarikta sanshodhan act 2019 ke khilaaf puure desh main virodh pradarshan chal rahaa he
 At the same time, many political parties who had voted in support of the Citizenship Amendment Bill inside the House are now seeing a sudden change in their attitude
 punjab main bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke sahyogi shiromani akali dal (SAD) kaa kahana he ki naagarikta sanshodhan act (CAA) main muslimon ko bhi shaamil kiya janaa chahie, hamaara desh secular he aise main sirf ek dharm ko baahar nikaalnaa sahi nahin he
 However, welcoming the law, Akali Dal spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said that the bill would help the oppressed minorities but it should also include people from the Muslim community
 party pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘hindu, sikh, buddha, jain, parsi, isai jinaki pakistan-afghanistan-bangladesh main pratadna hui, unhen ye bill bharat main jagah degaa ye bilkul sahi he
 But, another aspect of this is that Muslims are not involved in this
 'hamaari party kaa saaf kahana he ki is kanoon main muslimon ko bhi jagah deni chahie, hamaara samvidhan secular he
 The constitution says that there should be no injustice to a person of any religion
 akali dal ne isi ke saath deshbhar main is kanoon ke virodh main ho rahi hinsa kaa virodh kiya
 So Shiromani Akali Dal took U-turn
 Why does Shiromani Akali Dal take U-turn? And now why are they talking about bringing the oppressed Muslim community under this law? There are two reasons
 punjab main muslimon kii aabaadi bhale hi 1
 93 percent but they are indeterminate voters
 duusari baat, punjab ke gurdaspur main ahmadiya musalamaanon kaa garh he, kaadiyaan kasbe main hi is samudaay kii neenv padi thi
 Meanwhile, Sukhbir Badal said, 'many Muslims have been living in India for the last three decades
 aise main unhen mataghikaar se vanchit karnaa yaa unki naagarikta khatm karnaa thik nahin he
 'it is not good to keep the Muslims out - Jathedar Singh; The Akal Takht Jathedar Singh has said about this law that people of Sikh community cannot discriminate against anyone in the name of religion and caste
 isliye naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon se muslimon ko baahar rakhana thik nahin he
 He further said, 'muslims may be majority in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh but in India they are all minorities
 isliye unhen alag nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 Experts believe that the Ahmadiyya community has a population of only 1
5 million people across India
 punjab ke kaadiyaan ke alaava dilli, mumbai or chandigarh main bhi is samudaay ke kaaphi log rahete hai
 Most of these people are rich and prosperous and have settled in London
 aise main is samudaay ke logon ko alag karne se bharat ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Their population is not much in India, but by bringing them under this law, India can benefit greatly in world politics
 bataa den ki desh main naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon ke khilaaf badhate virodh ko dekhte hue bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or odisha ke mukhyamantri naveen patnayak ne apane rajya ke logon ko spasht kiya he ki wo enarasi (rashtriya naagarik register) lagu nahin karenge

 The whole country is shocked by the sudden death of Sridevi
 shanivaar ko 54 saal kii umr main shridevi ne dubai main antim saans lee
 She went to attend a wedding ceremony where she died
 shridevi kaa yun achaanak chale janaa behad dukhi karne vaala he
 Cardiac arrest is believed to be the reason behind the death of Sridevi, who is very conscious about fitness
 aakhir kya hota he cardiyak arest jo swasth or tandurust insaan ko bhi maut ke munh main pahunchaa saktaa he? aaie jaanate hai
 
 
 These 12 photos which went viral on social media after the death of Sridevi, are cardiac arrests in which information exchange between different parts of the heart gets messed up, due to which the heartbeat is affected
 jacardeopulmonary resstiseshan (CPR) ke jariye heart rate ko niyamit kiya jaataa he
 People who have had a heart attack before are more likely to suffer cardiac arrest
 shridevi ne khubasurat dikhne ke liye karai thim 29 surgery, kya yahi baniin maut kii vajah?heart atake or cardiyak arest main antarkai saare log in donon ko ek samajhate hai par ye alag-alag hai
 During a heart attack, blood flow accumulates in some parts of the heart due to which a heart attack occurs
 vahiin duusari taraf cardiyak atake main kinhin kaarnon se hriday uchit tareeke se kaam karnaa band kar detaa he or achaanak se ruk jaataa he
 Symptoms of cardiac arrest-heart palpitations Was 29 surgeries the reason for death? Need to contact a doctor immediately if you feel Chavaesa
 cardeopulmonary riskitshan (CPR) kii madad se iskaa ilaaj sambhav he
 However, normal doctors can also treat it with the help of a defibrillator

 When we are younger we think how easy it is to be a father
 bas offis janaa hota he or ghar aakar hamen daantnaa hota he
 But as we grow older, we realize how amazing our father is
 wo itnaa sabakuch kitni aasaani se sambhaal lete hai
 The father of all of us is our first superhero
 unki har baat hamen prabhavit karti he
 But becoming a super father is not so easy
 jaananaa chahenge kaise hote hai superfadar :1
 Those who listen to children do not mean that they only gossip with children
 ye to koi bhi kar saktaa he
 Super Fathers guess their children's likes and dislikes
 inhen baton se wo ye samajhane kii koshish karte hai ki unka baccha kisi baat par kisi soch rakhata he
 They listen to the child in good and bad times, and in addition to listening, give their opinion
 raay dete hai, thopate nahin hai
 2
 bacchon kii ruchi main hota he unka bhi interestchche pita apane bacchon kii pasand or naapsand kaa puraa dhyaan rakhte hai
 Often, the father wants his child to adopt the same hobbies that he has, but the super father gives the child a chance to choose his own hobbies
 ve na keval apane bacchon ko sapane dekhne kaa haq dete hai balkiunke sapanom ko khud bhi jeena shurukar dete hai
 They try to learn as much as possible about their child's hobbies and their dreams
 3
 It is often believed that the scolding is done by the father and the mother for love
 lekin achche pita har us vakt par apane bachche ke saath bane rahete hai, jab use unki jarurat hoti he
 a feeling of security when being with a father shows how much your father cares about you
 4
 Except for their needs, to meet the demand of the child, perhaps these parents do these things
 mata-pita banane ke baad unki praathamiktaayen badal jaati hai
 The person who used to buy new clothes every month before becoming a father, after becoming a father, suddenly those things start to make sense
 in chizon kii jagah bachche ke khilone or science kit le lete hai

 He strives in jail, and does not respond to the salute of fellow prisoners

 Somehow he arrives at the same prison where his mentor is

 Little do people know that before trying his luck in Bollywood, megastar Amitabh Bachchan wanted to become a radio presenter and for this he also went to Mumbai Studios auditions for All India Radio
 apane nae kaarykram ‘sitaron kii javaaniyaan’ ke saath radio par vaapasi kar rahe prasiddh radio udghoshak amin sayaani ne bataaya ki unke paas tab amitabh se milane kaa samay nahin tha, kyonki abhinayta ne wois audishan ke liye pehle se samay nahin liya tha
 Sayani said in an interview, 'it happened sometime in the late 1960s, when i used to do 20 shows a week
 har din meraa adhiktar samay sound studio main gujarata tha, kyonki main radio programing kii har prakriya main shaamil rahata tha
 One day a young man named Amitabh Bachchan came to give voice audition without taking any time
 'unhone kaha, 'mere paas us patale duble vyakti ke liye bilkul samay nahin tha
 He waited and returned, even after this he came several times
 lekin main usase nahin mil paaya or resepshanist ke madhyam se yah kahata rahaa ki vah pehle samay le phir aae
 '81-year-old Sayani later came to know that he was Amitabh, who used to come to his office to audition
 jab sayaani ne ‘anand’ film (1971) kaa ek troyal sho dekha, to vah amitabh ke vyaktitv or aawaaj se prabhavit hue or tab unhen pataa nahin tha ki vah amitabh hi the jo audishan ke liye aae the
 Rajesh Khanna worked with Amitabh in this film
 sayaani ne kaha, ‘‘amitabh ek award samaaroh main mukhya atithi ke rup main aae the or unhone apane sangharsh ke dinon ko yaad karte hue teen baar audishan ke liye radio stesan jane kii baat kahi or kaha ki unhen audishan main baithne bhi nahin diya gaya
 i was shocked to hear
 baad main jab maine unka saakshaatkaar kiya, to hamane is par lambii charchaa kii or hanse
 The Padma Shri honored radio presenter believes that what happened was for the good
 unhone kaha, 'haalanki aaj mujhe ise lekar khed hota he, mujhe lagata he ki jo hua vah ham donon ke liye acha hua
 i would be on the road and they would get so much work on radio that Indian cinema would be deprived of its biggest star
 'sayaani apane naye kaarykram ‘sitaron kii javaaniyaan’main prasiddh abhinaytaon, abhinetriyon, khalnaayakon, hasya kalakaaron or charitra abhinaytaon se jude aise hi dilachasp kisse pesh karenge

 bijepi kii dilli ikai ne koyala aayaat laagat upabhoktaaon par daalane ke centre sarkaar ke faisle kii shanivaar ko aalochana karte hue kaha ki isse rajdhani main bijli kii daron main 10 se 15 pratishat tak kii vruddhi hogi
 Delhi BJP President Vijay Goel said, "this step will impose increased electricity tariff on the common people and will increase the electricity rates by at least 10 to 15 percent
 ’goyal ne aarope lagaaya ki dilli kii congress sarkaar or centre ke congressi netaa bijli kii daren badhaane ke maamle main mili hue hai
 He said that if this is not the case, why did the Delhi government not oppose the move of the Union Finance Ministry? He said that this decision of the central government is actually a result of the coal scam
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne haal hi main jharkhand ke loksabhaa chunaavon main yahaan kii 14 main se 12 siten hasil kii hai
 But given the unique record of this state which has given different results in Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, it should keep its feet on the ground
 jabaki duusare dal, jo apni chhap chhodie main vifal rahe hai, ab kuch ummid kar sakate hai
 Past history tells everything
 2004 ke14veen loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke netritv vaale upie ko rajya main ekatarfa 13 siton par jeet hasil hui thi or rajya sarkaar kaa netritv kar rahi bijepi ko mahaj ek seat
 But after eight months, the results of the assembly elections were completely reversed
 bijepi netritv vaala endie rajya kii 82 siton vaali vidhansabha main 36 siten jitkar sabase bade gathbandhan ke rup main ubhara
 The BJP alone got 30 seats, which was more than the total seats won by the Congress and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM)
 thik isi tarah 2009 ke 15veen loksabhaa ke chunaavon main bijepi ko rajya main aath siten milin, lekin chah maheene baad hi jab vidhansabha ke chunaav hue to jeemem sabase badi party ke rup main vaapasi kar gaya
 The lack of uniformity in voting approach in elections and record of reversal of Lok Sabha elections has a deeper and deeper meaning
 rajya ke ek khufia adhikari ke anusaar virodhabhasi voting pattern kii vajah yah he ki matadaata centre sarkaar chunate samay rashtriya soch rakhata he
 "this is the reason why the state had clearly voted in favor of Congress and BJP in 2009 in the 2004 general elections," the official said
 vidhansabha chunaavon main vikalpon kii spashtataa gadabada jaati he, jahaan kshetreey aakanksha or pahchaan kii raajnneeti matadaataaon ke vyavhaar ko paribhaashit karti hai
 ÓÓ Second reason is that both the national parties do not have a well-known leader in the state
 congress or bijepi dhadon ke bharose chalati hai, isliye matadaataaon kaa bharosa unhen nahin mil paata
 Unlike them, regional parties like Babulal Marandi's Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM), Sudesh Mahto's Azu and Shibu Soren have clarity in the views and leadership of JMM
 isliye matadaata vidhansabha chunaavon main rashtriya dalon ke mukaable unhen chunata he
 Nearly a month after the Lok Sabha elections at the grassroots level, the politics of politics in the state has climbed the stove and all the major parties are coming into electoral color
 bijepi ke saamne loksabhaa chunaavon main party ke paksh main bani sakaaratmak hawa ko banaae rakhane kii badi chunauti he
 JMM, which won two Lok Sabha seats, has a challenge to get votes in the name of Hemant Soren, who has not been able to give popular government in the state
 loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon or hemanth kii alokapriyata ne jeemem ko hilaa kar rakh diya he
 Assembly elections are due in the state in November and Soren wants Congress, JMM and RJD to form pre-poll alliances to prevent BJP from repeating good performance
 duusari ore congress, ajasu, jeviem or argedy apane is paramparaagat maidan main aankade durust karne kii koshish main vyast hai
 BJP is also expected to suffer losses
 is baat kii charchaa he ki bijepi netaa arjuna manda is baar mukhyamantri ke ummidavaar nahin rahenge kyonki is baar party ke diggaj netaa yashavanth sinha apane grih rajya kii raajnneeti main ruchi dikhaa rahe hai
 Former Deputy Chief Minister Raghuvar Das could be another strong candidate who is silently running for the top post this time
 yadi yashavanth kii umr aade aati he to das is pad ke liye chupe rustam ke rup main ubhar sakate hai
 Many senior party leaders have given such statements that now the tradition of bringing tribal chief minister will be discontinued
 isse bijepi main arjuna munda or unke samarthak kheme ke liye raah mushkil ho sakati he
 BJP leaders also know that parliamentary elections are fought on national issues
 bijepi ke ek netaa ne kaha, ''rajya vidhansabha chunaavon main maamla puri tarah se alag he, yadi bijepi maahaul banaae nahin rakh paati he to aane vaali chunautiyaan party ko dharashayi kar sakati hai
 However, Yashwant Sinha has campaigned against the poor supply of electricity in the state and after the arrest in Hazaribagh, he has received people's sympathy, but not enough
 "rajya vidhansabha ke liye abhi chunaavon kii tithi ghoshit nahin hui he, lekin iske is saal november main hone kii sambhaavna he
 In this way, politicians hardly have five to six months
 jharkhand me philhal shashan kar rahaa hemanth sorain ke netritv vaala jeemem-congress-argedy gathbandhan bhi sankat main he
 The state Congress unit has expressed its intention to contest all 81 seats alone without any alliance with Soren
 shibu sorain or unke putr hemanth nai dilli main sonia gandhi se mili hai or unhen is baat ke liye raji karne kaa prayaas kiya he ki aane vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye congress ke saath gathbandhan banaae rakhana uchit he
 Soren argued that only by uniting can he stop the BJP from coming to the state
 sutron ke anusaar sonia ne abhi unhen koi aashwaasan nahin diya he
 The state Congress has given negative messages about this
 sudesh mahato ke netritv vaale ajasu ne ek maheene tak chalane vaale apane postcard abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kar di he jisamen pradhanmantri se rajya ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane kaa anurodh kiya gaya he 
 It has changed its party chiefs in 12 districts
 sudesh mahato ne kaha, ''sanghathan main vyapak pherbadal kii bhi yojana he
 "if the regional parties of Jharkhand are to rise again but stop the BJP divided in fact, they will have to work hard to form social alliances and political alliances

 (input agency se) If the Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati are uplifted by the SP-BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress is expecting Priyanka Gandhi
 in sabake bich india today conklev 2019 main bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main bijepi ko koi nuksaan nahin hone ja rahaa he balki hamen 73 sansadeey siton se 74 milegi 72 nahin hongi
 India Today Group news director Rahul Kanwal asked Amit Shah how many seats will the NDA get in 2019? Answering this question, he said that it is difficult to give the number of seats, but we will come to power in advance and Narendra Modi will once again become the Prime Minister of the country
 upi main hamen 73 se badhkar 74 siten milengi lekin 72 siten nahin hone ja rahi he
 Let me tell you that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had entered the electoral fray in UP along with Apna Dal
 soobe kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se bijepi 71 or apana dal 2 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 However, in the by-elections, the BJP lost 3 seats
 is tarah se maujuuda samay main 68 siten bijepi ke paas bachi hui hai
 In fact, to defeat the BJP in UP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the SP-BSP has forgotten the 23-year-old rivalry and joined hands
 jabaki congress ne priyanka gandhi ko mahasachiv banaate hue upi ke purvanchal kii jimmedaari saunpi he
 In such a situation, Amit Shah said in India Today Conclave 2019 that in Uttar Pradesh, the alliance of Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati will not make any difference to us even if there is a SP-BSP vote base
 lekin ye kahana ki akhilesh or mayawati kaa gathbandhan hamaare liye bada khatra he to ye bada shabd ho jayega
 However, our party will do the job of preparing for the elections with full preparation and seriousness
 amit shah ne kaha ki uttar pradesh ke 2017 vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan jab sapa or congress ne gathbandhan kiya tha to bhi kaha jaataa tha ki unhen 270 siten milengi, lekin kya aisa hua
 The results of UP are in front of everyone
 or ek baar phir 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi pehle se behatar nattejey aaenge
 At the same time, on the question of Priyanka's entry into active politics, Amit Shah said, 'I believe that the days of politics in the name of familyism are over
 priyanka kii entry media ke liye sirf ek event he, baaki isse kuch hone vaala nahin he
 ' uttar pradesh or uttarakhand ke purv mukhyamantri narayan dutt tiwari ke bete rohit shekhar tiwari kii sandigdh maut kaa maamla ulajhata hi ja rahaa he
 In this regard, the Delhi Police has registered a case of murder last night
 40 saal ke rohit apane ghar main mrit paae gaye the
 His nose was bleeding
 darasal, is maamle main pehle se kuch jhol najar aa rahaa tha
 Therefore, the investigation of this case has now been handed over to the Crime Branch
 cese transfar hone ke baad krime branch kii ek team rohit shekhar tiwari ke dephence colony main maujuud ghar par ja pahunchi
 Also, the CFSL team has been called there
 mauka-e-vaardaat par chaanbin kii ja rahi he
 Crime Branch is scanning footage of CCTV cameras installed in Rohit Shekhar Tiwari's house
 jaankaree ke mutabik rohit ke ghar main 7 sisitivi camere lage hai
 2 of which were not working
 cese kii jaanch padtaal bhi ab hatya ke angel se kii ja rahi he

" uttari korea dashakon tak china kaa iklauta saajheedaar bana rahaa, lekin aaj beijing main ek nai kahawat chal padi he jisamen pakistan ko ''ba taai" yani fauladi bhai kaha jaataa he
 In recent months, India is concerned about the extent to which China has started taking sides on important bilateral issues in the interest of Pakistan

 In the aftermath of the Uri attack, the tension between India and Pakistan has increased and India has also responded with all-round surgical strike across the Line of Control, as well as isolating Pakistan on the diplomatic front, so Pakistan The extent of China's relations with India will determine whether India's efforts succeed or fail

 Although the Chinese opposition to the group's open session in Seoul in June was not unexpected, what was shocking was that it openly took the stand of Pakistan's involvement with India
 ek adhikari ne kaha ki yah spasht sanket tha ki china donon deshon ke saath samaan duuri banaakar chalanaa chaah rahaa he
 Beijing made its stand clear when it also sent them to Islamabad on 23 September, barely ten days after sending its representatives to Delhi for talks on the NSG

 The fact is that China's strategic concern is not about India

 One of the party's academics openly states that "beijing's biggest fear is that India does not become Japan or South Korea
" " ve sanket dete hai ki china itnaa laaparvaah nahin hoga ki bharat ko aisi sthiti main dhakel de
 That is why, as some people say, China is currently in a tizzy over Pakistan because it is also looking to establish a regional counterbalance for India out of fear of the indo-us alliance
 yah agenda khaas taur se sena or suraksha agenciyon ke madhyam se aage badhaayaa ja rahaa he jo bharat ko ek spasht khatre ke taur par dekhte hai
 The same thing explains China's ambiguous attitude towards India

 This fact makes it clear why China is often willing to tolerate the Pakistani attitude of airing anti-india terrorists

 China is also concerned about the security situation inside Pakistan
 yahaan tak ki china ne bhi pakistan par ravaiya badalane kaa dabaav daalaa he or masood ajahar ko baar-baar bachaane ke tark par sawaal khadaa kar rahaa he
 This was quoted by Pakistan Foreign Secretary Ejaz Chaudhary in a report of the Pakistani daily Dawn of October 6 which he had told the top officials in an internal meeting
 udi hamale or bharat ke kiye sargical hamale par beijing kii satark pratikriya is uhapoh ko rekhaankit karti he

 However, when Pakistan sent two special envoys to Beijing on the Kashmir issue, they were able to meet a junior foreign minister and China did not issue any statement in support of Pakistan's side
 yahaan tak ki yuanessi main bhi china ne pakistan dwaara baar-baar kashmir kaa masalaa uthaae jane kii koshishon ko chunauti di he or apana paksh doharaaya he ki yah masalaa bharat or pakistan ke bich kaa he

 Yes, these three forms of Ganapati are seated together under one roof and even if the devotees get the privilege of seeing them, then all the wishes of the devotees are guaranteed to be fulfilled
 shipra nadi ke tat par basaa shahar ujjain
 The capital of the kingdom of King Vikramaditya and the religious site called the city of Kalidas, Ujjain, where the name of Mahakal is called particle
 jahaan aasmaan main laharaati dharm pataakaa kisi shakti ke hone kaa har pal ehsaas karwaati rahati he
 This feeling becomes deeper when the philosophy of Siddhi and Bhakti are in three different forms under one roof
 bhagwaan ke in teenon roopon ke darshan kar parinay sutara main bandhe jode apane nae safar kii shuruuaat yahaan aashirwad lekar hi karte hai
 Lord Chintaman Ganesh Dham is located about 5 km from Ujjain where devotees have the privilege of seeing not one but three Ganpati's together under one roof
 ek taraf jahaan dikhte hai chintamani ganesh jo bhakton ke samast dukh, samast chintaaon ko harne vaale maane jate hai to vahiin siddhi ganesh or icchaaman ganesh bhi mand mand muskaan ke saath karte hai apane bhakton kaa swaagat
 The special thing is that this form of God Chintamani seems to be his face
 vinayak kii teenon murtiyon swayambhu hai
 Devotees first see Chintamani and then after wishing Ganesha, they ask for a boon to fulfill their wish
 iske baad baari aati he siddhivinayak kii jo riddhi-siddhi ke daata hai
 It is said that once Lord Chintaman, Ichchaman and Siddhivinayak take the burden of auspiciousness in the temple of Chintaman, they leave it uninterrupted
 phir chaahe beti kii shaadi ho yaa phir kisi nae kaary kaa aarambh karnaa ho, vinayak ke darbar main bhakton ko unki har samasya kaa samaadhaan miltaa he
 If the image of Bappa is unique in this temple built in Ujjain, then the method of worship in this temple of Parvati son is no less unique
 bhakton kaa maananaa he ki kisi bhi mangal kaary ke aarambh hone se pehle agar ek nariyal or mangal kaary kaa nimantran bappa ke charnon main rakh diya jaae to us kaary ke nirvighn puraa hone kii guarantee hoti he
 This is the reason that after worship on one side, on the wall of the temple, the swastika is made upside down and brought to the Ganapati, after fulfilling his wish and desire, the devotees come here and make a straight swastika
 to vahiin duusari ore kuch bhakt mauli baandhakar bhi bappa se kehete hai apni ichha
 What is the place of Ganapati in the Malwa region of Ujjain, you can guess from the fact that the first invitation to any wedding in the area comes in this court of Vinayak
 var vadhoo ke mata-pita pehle aakar pujari ko lagn kii taarikh likhavate hai phir navvivaahit jode ganpati kaa aashirwad lekar hi apane vaivaahik jivan kaa aarambh karte hai
 Though there are innumerable temples of Ganapati in Madhya Pradesh, but this abode of Bappa holds the highest position, the devotees do not forget to appreciate their fate by getting the blessings of Vinayaka's three forms under one roof
 ujjain ke chintamani ganesh ko prasann karnaa or unase manachaaha aashirwad paanaa behad aasaan he
 Worshiping God with the laddoos of Motichur is made swastika upside down on the back wall of the temple, then it doesn't take long to complete

 Every thing in the court of Chintamani, who fulfills every wish of the devotees, is unique
 mandir main pratishthit bappa kaa swaroop itnaa aakarshak he ki shraddhalu ek pal ke liye bhi ise apni ankhon se ojhal nahin hone dete
 The sound of mantras and bells rising from the temple complex dissolves a distinct sweetness in the ears
 shraddhalu yahaan aane ke baad teenon ganesh kii bhakthi main bandha kar apni tamaam chitaanon ko bappa ke charnon main arpit kar nishcint ho jate hai
 With the opening of the temple in the morning, the worship of the forms of Chintaman, Ichman and Siddhivinayak begins in the temple which continues till night
 pat khulte hi mandir ke pujari bhagwaan chintaman kaa jal se abhishek karte hai, iske baad bhagwaan ko doodh, ghi or panchamrita chadhaaya jaataa he
 After the consecration of Chintaman, Ichman, and Siddhivinayak from Panchamrit, the statue was decorated with ghee and vermilion on the idol

 '' ayog main intervyuu ke liye chah board hai jinaki adhyakshata ayog ke sadsy karte hai
 Each board has two specialists

 Paliwal explains, "no board member knows which student they are going to interview

 "the board chairman and both members will give the number in the interview

 The Modi government is going to introduce a law in Parliament, after its implementation, all your money deposited in banks will be grabbed by the bank and you will not be able to do anything
 party karyaalay main press conference ko sambodhit karte hue party ke rashtriya pravaktaa raghav chaddha ne kaha ki ‘ek taraf desh main samaaj kosampradayikta ke aadhaar parbantkar bahes chhedi gai he or janata kaa dhyaan in garajaruri muddon kii taraf jaanboojhkar modaa hua he or duusari taraf desh kii modi sarkaar chor raste se ek aisa kanoon laane kii taiyaari main he jo is desh kii janata ke bank-khaaton par parmaanu bam kaa kaam karegaa
 The AAP spokesperson said that Modi ji fixed the Jan Dhan Yojana, demonetisation, then the limit to withdraw money from his own account and now the FRDI Act
 yah siries darshaati he ki modi ji kii ek niti he or wo yah ki ‘garib kaa paisa nikaalo or udyogpatiyon or dhannasethon kii jeb main daalo’ or FRDI naam is kanoon ke lagu ho jane ke baad to hame apana paisa kisi bhi bank main rakhane se pehle us bank kii aarthik sthiti kaa bhi khyaal rakhana hoga

 If your money deposited in your bank account (which you have kept for your old age or any illness or for children's education or marriage), that money can be lost anytime after the implementation of this law
 aapse bagaiyr puche hadap liya jayega aapkaa paisabank ke liye ab bail- out darasal bail-in banane ja rahaa he
 Meaning, earlier when a big industrialist did not return a loan to a bank and the bank was on the verge of bankruptcy, the government used to help the bank which is also called bail-out package by giving money from its pocket but now this law Through this, a bail-in system will be made, that is, the money of the common people of the country which is deposited in their bank accounts will be grabbed by the bank and will be able to recover their losses by waiving the loan of the industrialists
 Some will be done without your consent

 Malala Yousafzai is not happy about hearing the news of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize for the common Pakistani and especially the people of his hometown of Swat
 vahaan logon khaskar schuli ladakiyon ne mithaiyaan bantee or ise un logon ke liye khaas khushkhabari bataaya, jo taliban aatankiyon ke shikaar bane hai
 The Taliban was under illegal occupation in Swat district from 2009 to 2010 and during that time the education and education of girls was banned
 unki daleel thi ki islam main auraton ko shiksha hasil karne kii ijaajat nahin he or jo log apni betiyon-bahanon ko skool main bhej rahe hai, ve kafir hai, unhen maut ke baad jananath naseeb nahin hogi
 At the same time, Malala Yousafzai, then studying in the 8th, began writing columns for the BBC Urdu service
 apane stambhon main malala ladakiyon kii padhai kii ahmiyat bataaya karti thim or sabhi logon se taliban ke hukmanaamon ko darkinar kar apni bahan-betiyon ko skool bhejne kii vakaalat karti thim
 This angered Taliban fighters and in October 2012, Malala was shot in the head while riding in a school van on her way home
 iske baad ve badi himmat or duniyabar kii madad se maut ke munh se baahar ain lekin unka hausala or jajba or majboot ho gaya
 Malala is from an ordinary family
 unke pita jiyauddin yusufajai ek enjio or nijee skool chalaaya karte the
 In this school, Malala used to study before the attack
 hamale ke baad malala ko britain le jaaya gaya, jahaan unke sir kaa kaamyaab oparation hua
 She now lives in England
 unke pita jiyauddin yusufajai ko bhi britain main pakistani ucchayog main naukari di gai kyonki ghar lautne ke liye maahaul saajagaar nahin tha
 Since then Malala has received many international accolades and awards for her education campaign
 lekin shuukravaar ko nobel shanti puraskaar milane kii khabar malala ke deshavaasiyon or khaskar swat ghati ke logon ke liye bepanaah khushi lekar aayaa
 Malala was born in 1997 in the town of Swat
 swat main unke skool kii dost mushtari bibi ne kaha, “malala yusufajai ko nobel shanti puraskaar kii khabar se swat ke log kaaphi khush hai
 "she says that the news of such a large international honor may be disappointing for the Taliban but the common people are quite happy
" unka yah bhi kahana he ki is khabar se swat main padhai-likhaai main logon ko dilchaspee or badhegi or maa-baap apni betiyon ko bekhauf hokar skool bhejenge, jahaan taliban ne 2007 se 2009 ke apane gaiyr-kanoonee kabje ke dauraan 250 skool tod die the
 She says, "now the fear ran away
 malala ne hamen padhai-likhaai kaa virodh karne waalon ke saamne khulkar khadey hone kii himmat de di he
 Malala has become an example for girls in poor countries of the world and her example will give courage to girls for education
