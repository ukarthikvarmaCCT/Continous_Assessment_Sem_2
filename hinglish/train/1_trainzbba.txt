 film kaa naam:banke kii kreji baratdiarector:ejaj khanster cast:raajapaal yadav, sanjay mishra, vijay raaj, rakesh bedi, tia bajpeynvadhi:138 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:1
 Comedy films have been made many times about 5 Starmulti Stars, such as 'bombay to Goa', 'money Back Guarantee', 'khichdi', 'chala Musaddi Office Office', etc
, but the public appreciating these films was very less
 ek baar phir se manze hue actors ko lekar film 'banke kii kreji baraat' banaai gai he, kya yah film paisa vasuul he? aaiye jaanate hai
 Story: This story is from Himachal Pradesh, where Kamakdev's Bhakt Banke (rajpal Yadav) lives with his parents Nandlal (rakesh Bedi) and uncle Kanhaiya Lal (sanjay Mishra)
 banke ko shaadi kerani he lekin kuch grah dosha hone ke kaaran uski shaadi ke liye ek hi upaay he ki koi or shaadi karke banke ko dulhan de de
 Lallan Bhaiya (vijay Raj) also helps Banke greatly in this work and the hired groom is searched for this fake wedding
 viraat (sathyajith dube) duulhe ke rup main banke banakar anjali (tia bajpeyi) se vivaah karata he lekin antat kahani kuch or ho jaati he
 The script has a decent storyline but the screenplay is quite light, director Ejaz Khan unsuccessfully tries to capitalize on the potential of all the actors 100 percent and despite a lot of laughs on many occasions, the film seems boring after a while
 is
 actingacting ke maamle main jab bhi sanjay mishra or vijay raaj screen par aate hai to aapke chehre par muskaan chhod hi jate hai
 The tadka of Rajpal Yadav's comedy is also comical and Tia Bajpai and Satyajit Dubey have done commendable work as groom and bride
 sangitafilm kaa 'mehandi' song acha he lekin kuch sikvence aise the jahaan gaanon ne aakar film kii lay ko kharaab kiya he
 Seeing why this film would be a great experience for acting
 saaf-suthri kamedi kuch pal ke liye aapako kaalpanik duniya main le jaakar aapke chehre par jarur muskaan laaegi
 Why not see if you are looking for spice comedy in the film then this film will disappoint you

 By the way, it is being told that Kejriwal is ill, due to which he is already going to go to Bengaluru on 10 days leave, but the thing is that Arvind Kejriwal wants to avoid joining that discussion in the national executive meeting In which Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan have to decide whether or not to be removed from the Political Affairs Committee
 kejariwal shaayad ye sandesh dena chaah rahe hai ki party ke kisi bhi faisle ko lete vaqt unka hona yaa unki raay utani myne nahin rakhti jitani bataai ja rahi he
 However, it is also a matter that if voting takes place in the meeting of the National Executive on the issue of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan, then ethically Arvind Kejriwal, Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan would like to avoid voting anyway and leaving it to the national executive would be all right

 Army Chief General Bipin Rawat said on Thursday that gay sex and adultery will not be allowed in the Indian Army
 sena pramukh ne yah bayaan supreme court dwaara vayaskon ke bich samalangik sambandhon ko aparaadh kii shrenee se baahar karne or british kaaleen vyabhichaar sambandhi ek kanoonee praavdhaan ko radd karne ke kuch maheene baad diya he
 General Rawat, while replying to a question related to the impact of the two historic decisions of the Supreme Court, told reporters in the discussion, 'this is not acceptable in the army
 'sena pramukh ne kaha ki unka bal kanoon se upar nahin he, lekin sena main samalangik yon sambandh or vyabhichaar kii ijaajat dena mumkin nahin hoga
 He said on adultery, 'the army is conservative
 sena ek parivaar he
 We cannot let this happen in the army
 'unhone kaha ki simaaon par tainaat sainikon or afasaron ko unke parivaar ke bare main phikrmand nahin hone diya ja saktaa
 The conduct of army personnel is governed by the Army Act
 general ravat ne kaha, 'sena main hamen kabhi nahin laga ki yah ho saktaa he
 Whatever it seemed like, it was inserted into the Army Act
 jab sena adhinium bana to iske bare main suna bhi nahin tha
 We never thought it was going to happen
 ham ise kabhi ijaajat nahin dete
 Therefore it was not inserted into the Army Act
 'unhone kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki jo kaha ja rahaa he yaa jis bare main baat ho rahi he use bhartiya sena main hone kii ijaajat nahin di jaaegi
 However, at the same time General Rawat said that the army is not above the law and the Supreme Court is the highest judicial body in the country
 darasal, sena vyabhichaar ke maamalon se jujh rahi he or aropiyon ko aksarcourt marshalaka saamana karnaa padataa he
 Adultery is defined in the military language as 'gaining the love of a fellow officer's wife'
 sena pramukh ne 15 janvari ko sena diwas se pehle samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, 'ham desh ke kanoon se pare nahin hai, lekin jab aap bhartiya sena main shaamil hote hai to aapke paas jo adhikaar hai

 'significantly, in September last year, the Constitution Bench of five judges of the Supreme Court unanimously repealed Section 377 of the IPC declaring unnatural sexual intercourse between adults as a crime

 bhartiya team jo vishwa cap ke liye chuni gai he, usamen piyush chawla ko shaamil kiye jane par jo bahes chhidi he, use samajhnaa koi mushkil nahin he
 After waiting for more than two years, 23-year-old Piyush was selected in the team for the World Cup simply because captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni wanted to diversify his bowling attack, while meanwhile, other bowlers like leg-spinner Amit Mishra and left Hand spinner Pragyan Ojha kept going with India's Test and ODI teams
 haalanki vishwa cap ke khel shuru hone main abhi kuch samay he, lekin centurian main dakshin africa ke khilaaf final mukaable main chawla kaa pradarshan kuch khaas nahin rahaa tha
 Even then, the preference given to him on the bowler bowler Ashish Nehra would be considered as charisma
 isi vajah se uttar pradesh ke is leg spinner ko vishwa cap kii team main shaamil kiye jane se bahes or tej ho gai he
 In the recent IPL auction, Kings XI Punjab retained Piyush Chawla in his team by bidding $ 9,00,000
 yah keemat adam gilcrist ke baraabar thi or praveen kumaar tathaa abhishek nair se puure 1,00,000 dollar zyada thi
 In view of this, Chawla is getting mixed opinion on getting elected
 kuch log isaki tarif kar rahe hai to kuch log virdohi sur alaap rahe hai
 But because of this, when this young player takes the field for World Cup matches, there will be a lot of pressure on his shoulders
 haa, yah sunakar chawla kaa utsaah jarur badha hoga ki ajit wadekar or dilip vengsarakar sareekhe bharat ke purv captainon ne unke chayan kaa swaagat kiya or kaha ki isse dhoni ko apni gendbaaji main ek or vikalp mil jayega
 But some people are criticizing it
 bishan singh bedi ko to chayankartaaon kii soch par hi hairaangi he or ve vishwa cap kii team main chawla ko shaamil kiye jane ko chakra dene vaala qaraar dete hai
 "I am surprised that the selectors preferred a leg-spinner who bowls with chest-on action, while Ojha's left-arm spin would have been more effective," he says
 '' ve bataate hai, ''mujhe yaad he ki kuch saal pehle neshnal cricket academy main maine irapalli (prasanna) ke saath piyush ko gendbaaji karte hue dekha tha
 Then i felt that this boy has amazing talent
 lekin samay bitne ke saath lagata he usamen vah dhar khatm ho chuki he, jo match jitaane vaale ek leg spinner main honi chahie
 "bedi is inclined to think of those who believe that it would have been more appropriate to replace a batsman like Rohit Sharma or Manish Pandey in the team
" bedi kehete hai, ''usase team prabandhan ko ballebaaji ke asafal hone par kuch sahaara rahata
 Yuvraj is bowling really well and he can bowl eight to ten overs
 saath hi yusuf pathan, suresh raina, sachin tendulkar or virendra sahvaag bhi acchhee gendbaaji karte hai, aise main mujhe aashcharya hoga ki kisi match main do mukhya spinner ek saath khelen
 May be r
 aswin or chawla donon hi surakshit khilaadiyon main baithe rah jaaen, haalanki aswin ko of spin ke liye pehali pasand ke taur par dekha ja saktaa he
 If Dhoni and the team management thought that Chawla could contribute significantly, he should have given Chawla an opportunity in every match on the tour of South Africa so that he would get some more practice
 ''mukhya chayankarta ke
 Srikanth said that his committee hoped that the pitches would be dry which would help the spin bowlers
 or chawla duusare pratiyogiyon main sabase anbhavi the
 Dhoni defends Chawla with full confidence
 ve kehete hai, ''team main piyush ko shaamil karnaa acha he kyonki ve hamale main vividhta denge
 They can also bat
 agar ham paanch gendbaajon ke saath khelte hai to ve number 7 yaa number 8 kram par ballebaaji kar sakate hai
 In the last two rounds, Chawla scored 36 in 23 first-class matches in India and England
 20 kii ausat se 1,086 ran banaae the
 But the question is, what feat has Chawla done in odis and T20 matches so that he can be counted among the leading players of India? The leg-spinner has taken just two wickets in three T20 matches for India, while he has taken a total of 28 wickets in 22 matches of 50 overs
 unke aalochakon kaa kahana he ki unke bare main isse zyada bataane ke liye kuch nahin he
 Those who criticize Chawla's selection say that the statement made by Dhoni at Cape Town indicated that Chawla would be included in the 11 players only when India fielded five main bowlers
 paanch mukhya gendbaajon ke saath bharat aakhri baar 2009 main dakshin africa main champions trophy main australia ke khilaaf khelaa tha
 Then what could be the other reason for Chawla's election? a former player, he is a lucky player for Dhoni
 unke mutabik, ''captain kaa maananaa he ki chawla us team kaa hissaa the, jisane 2007 main dakshin africa main tii-20 kaa vishwa cap jeeta tha
 He was also involved in two final matches against Australia in the Commonwealth Bank Series in March 2008 and India won both matches
 ''chawla ke chayan ne bhale hi kuch logon ko chaunkaaya ho, lekin unki asal chunauti vishwa cap ke muqablon main hogi, jab unhen apni phiraki gendon se virdohi team ke ballebaajon ke wicket chatakaane kaa jimmaa saunpa jayega
 At home in Aligarh, he is called Paras, which is believed to be a stone that makes any thing gold
 shaayad unka jaadu kaam kar jaae or unki madad se bharat kii team ek arab bharatiyon ke sapanom ko sach sabit kar de

 sushant sihan rajput se poocha gaya ki agar wo piem modi banakar uthte hai to wo kya karenge? is par sushant ne kaha, 'india ko achche ke liye badalenge
 After this, Sushant was asked the same question about Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli and actress Kangana Ranaut
 sushant ne jawaab diya ki agar wo viraat kohli banakar kisi din uthenge to wo ek or centuri lagaayenge
 In the name of Kangana Ranaut, Sushant thought a little thoughtfully, 'I will only talk about the essentials

 Pakistan seems to be stuck inside and outside its home on the use of F-16 fighter aircraft given by the US against India
 jahaan america videsh mantralay ne kaha he ki epa-16 ke istemaal ke report kii najadik se jaanch kar rahaa he, to vahiin pakistan ke ucch sadan yani sinet main imran khan sarkaar se epa-16 kaa aatmaraksha ke istemaal kii sharton ko lekar sawaal puche ja rahe hai
 The Indian Air Force has claimed that the Pakistani Air Force used the F-16 fighter aircraft in violation of Indian airspace on February 27 and targeted military targets with the AMRAAM missile
 air vaais marshall arjike kapur ne bharat ke daawey ko majboot karne ke liye AMRAAM missile ke tukade dikhaae jo bhartiya hisse main paae gaye
 RGK Kapoor said that this missile can only fit in the F-16
 epa-16 ke istemaal kii jaanch kar rahaa he americanmerica videsh mantralay ke up pravaktaa robert paladino ne pakistan kii taraf se epa-16 ke istemaal or sharton ke ulanghan par kaha, 'hamane is tarah kii report dekhi he or ham is maamle kii najdiki se jaanch kar rahe hai
 i cannot confirm anything right now, but we do not comment publicly on the subject of US defense technology related bilateral agreements
 'aatankwaad ke mudde par pehle ghire pakistan par rajanyik dabaav badhaate hue nai dilli ne america adhikariyon se kaha ki bharat ke khilaaf epa-16 kaa istemaal kar pakistan ne deal kii sharton kaa ulanghan kiya he
 Because the US had given this plane to Pakistan only for the war against terrorism
 raksha visheshgy air vaais marshall (rita
 ) Kapil Kak says that the US had given F-16 aircraft to Pakistan for war against terror
 lekin america pakistan ko hawa se hawa main maar karne vaali AMRAAM misile kyon de rahaa he? kyonki aatankwaadiyon ke paas to vayusena he nahin
 According to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn, the question raised in the Senate of Pakistan, Mian Raza Rabbani has questioned the Government of Pakistan whether there is any condition regarding the use of F-16 or not in the Senate
 Rabbani asked that if the F-16 jet cannot be used for self-defense, what is its use? He referred to the statement of Air Marshal Shahid Latif, former Vice Chief of the Pakistan Air Force, who signed the F-16 deal with the US in 2008
 rabbaani ne kaha ki is raksha saude main koi bharat-vishesh shart sanlagn nahin tha
 Strangely, the F-16 was being debated in the Pakistani Senate and Defense Minister Pervez Khatak was not aware of whether there was any condition in the F-16 agreement between Pakistan and the US
 unhone kaha ki ve jald hi sadan ko jaankaree denge ki is tarah kii koi shart he yaa nahin
 Defense expert Kapil Kak says that the terms of the deal are confidential, but at the time the deal was done, the foreign media reported that the US had given the F-16 aircraft for the defense of Pakistan and used it in an offensive
 is wrong
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki 27 farvari ko pakistan ne na sirf bhartiya vaayu kshetra kaa ulanghan kiya balki bharat ke sainya thikaanon ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya
 At least the pieces of AMRAAM fitted in the F-16 do confirm it

 At an election rally, he described Romney as dishonest and asked him to tell the 'truth' about his policies
 vahiin, unke chunaav abhiyaan se jude logon kaa kahana he ki prachaar ranneeti main badlaav ho sakate hai

 ab is exam kii taiyaari ke liye do maheene se bhi kam samay bachaa he
 So keep these points in mind while revising in the last time
 1
 Extend the preparation deadline: The syllabus of NET exam is larger, and very few time is left
 aise main aap sahi se ek shedul banaaen
 Most of the students who have cleared the NET exam believe that studying done by making a schedule in the last time helps more in passing the exam
 2
 Pay more attention to basic things: In NET exam, many questions are related to the basic information of that subject, so increase the basic information
 3
 Syllabus and Pattern: Before preparing for the exam, do check syllabus once, lest at the last moment you know that a topic is left
 4
 Make a preparation strategy: It is very important to have a strategy to prepare in a short time, you prepare some questions by yourself and try to find the answers
 agar aap ise rojaanaa karenge to aapaki taiyaari sahi disha main badhati rahegi
 5
 practice:angreji main ek kahawat practice mex main parfect, ji haa practice se aap koi bhi kaam achche tarah se kar sakate hai
 Keep a clear vision, time management and key factors with you and repeat it
 aisa karne par aap zyada sikh paaenge
 6
 follow study materialas:kai baar students jaldbaaji ke chakkar main market se un kitabon ko kharid laate hai, jiskaa study material bahut hi ghatiya hota he, jisase aapaki taiyaari galat disha me ja sakati he
 To prepare the net, always buy a book thoughtfully and with advice
 7
 Make shortnotes: When you understand how much time to spend on which topic, then after that you can make shortnotes of those topics, in which at least you can get complete information about that topic
 8
 Revision: Before the exam, the most important revision is to be done, revision leads to success
 exam ke kuch din pehle se tay kar len ki in dinon main sirf or sirf revijan karnaa hi he
 There are many such things that you read before the exam, but forget later
 is galati se bachane ke liye revijan zarur kar len

 iske baad jab 5 oktober 2017 ko agra main samaajawaadee party kaa 10waan rashtriya sammelan hua or akhilesh kii 5 saal ke liye adhyaksh ke rup main tajposhi hui to mulaayam singh or shivpal yadav vahaan nahin pahunche

 What is bjp's strategy? Party strategists are aware that one vote each in the presidential election is going to be valuable

 Shiv Sena has said that Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat should be made the presidential candidate
 itnaa hi nahin, raashtrapati chunaav main vidhayak or saansad kisi vip se nahin bandhe hote
 Hence there is always the possibility of cross voting
 party kii ek phikr up-raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar bhi he
 Allied parties may negotiate a vice-presidential term in exchange for support in the presidential election
 jaahir he bijepi nahin chaahegi ki use up-raashtrapati chunaav ke liye ummidavaar ko lekar samjhauta karnaa pade
 For this, it is necessary that he can win the presidential election on his own

 ab neshnal register of citigens of india (NRC) ke mudde par bhi kishor ne apni baat rakhi he
 In a special chat with NDTV, he said, 'I am not going behind its intent
 hakeekat main jab is tarah ke kanoon lagu hote hai to vah garib hi hote hai jo sabase zyada isse pratadit hote hai
 Like demonetisation, the purpose of implementing it was to hurt those who have black money
 amiron ke paas hi kalaadhan hota he
 After all, who paid the price for it, the poor man paid the price, who did not even have black money
 unhen line main laganaa padaa
 'prashant Kishore further said,' Talking about NRC, everyone has to show their documents to prove their citizenship
 bahut se logon ke paas dastavej nahin honge yaa unhen wo hasil nahin kar paaenge
 Even if there are documents, people will have to visit government offices for this
 isse wo pratadit honge, bhrashtachar badhegaa va anya kai takaliphen paidaa hongi
 200 million people do not have their own house, how will those people prove their citizenship
 'JDU upaadhyaksh ne aage kaha, 'NRC ke liye aadhaar yaa voter idi card kii baat honi chahie
 Either the government should say that those who have Aadhaar and voter cards are citizens of India, but they (government) are not saying so
 iskaa matlab he ki NRC ke liye hamen aadhaar or voter card se aage ke dastavej dikhaane honge
 Why are we doing this? maan lete hai ki desh main teen pratishat log avaidh tareeke se rah rahe hai to unka pataa lagane ke liye aap koi doosraa tarika apanaaen or unhen baahar karen, usamen koi harj nahin
 Prashant Kishore further said, "I am a citizen of India and what do i need to prove it
 main sarkaar ke is faisle ko samaj nahin paa rahaa hum
 If the government does not mention the implementation of NRC in the country, then citizenship amendment law can be discussed, there is no harm in it
 agar sarkaar iske combination kii baat kahati he to phir yah bilkul bhi manjuur nahin he
 Then it discriminates not only on religious but also class basis
 'unhone aage kaha, 'meri party ne naagarikta kanoon kaa samarthan kiya lekin maine iskaa virodh kiya
 Only the head of the party (nitish Kumar) can tell about the support
 party kai baar kah chuki he ki NRC kii bihar main koi jarurat nahin he or unhone (nitish kumaar) mujhe bharosa dilaayaa he

 co / 5rqmpoa7iz — Reema Kagti (@kagtireema) May 25, 2019 It is worth mentioning that after the bitter defeat of NDA in Lok Sabha elections 2019, Rahul Gandhi had offered to resign from the post of President of Congress to the Congress Working Committee but rejected his offer
 Has been done
 unhone ye bhi kaha tha ki is pad ke liye priyanka gandhi kaa naam bhi naa liya jaae or nayaa adhyaksh gandhi parivaar se itar kisi vyakti ko bananaa chahie
 In the opinion of many political pundits, this resignation could have signaled a big change for the Congress government which has suffered the dynasty, but the Congress Working Committee refused to take his resignation and said that the party should not be allowed to do so under these adverse circumstances
 Leadership is required

 In the program of the women's branch of FICCI in Delhi, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar admitted that discrimination against women appears to exist in the society as well
 unhone bataaya ki teen mahila afasaron ko ladaaku vimaan udaane kii ijazat dene vaali file unke paas chaar maheene main ai
 He said that there may be a male mentality of the ministry behind this too
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki agar purush sainikon ko ye lagata ho ki ve mahila afasaron ke maatahat kaam kaise karenge to sarkaar sena main mahilaon kii alag batalian bana sakati he
 He reminded that this country belongs to the queen of Jhansi and mother Durga
 unhone kaha ki jab ve raksha mantri bana to is bare main kuch karne kii baat sochi
 The Defense Minister said that when the Chief of Air Force asked him to fly women fighter aircraft, he immediately called for the file

 The comments unhone kaha ki mahilaayein kyon nahin yudhpot par ja sakati hai? kyon nahin unke liye vahaan alag se suvidhaayen banaayi ja sakati hai

 But it took four months to arrive
 tippaniyan He said why can't women go on a warship? Why not separate facilities can be made there for them
 beshak, sarkaar ek jatke main sena main mahilaon kii taadaad nahin badha sakati lekin dhire-dhire koshish ho rahi he
 The time will also come that women will get a chance in Sainik School and National Defense Academy
 18 june ko vayusena main teen mahilon ko combet role main shaamil kiya gaya he
 It is still a far-fetched army and navy
 itnaa hi nahin, sena main abhi bhi ginati kii mahila afasar hai, jawan to hai hi nahin
 He said that when he became the defense minister, he thought of doing something about it

 Well, today i thought about writing this because Moti Bagh Metro Station on Ring Road in Delhi is named - Dr
 M
 vishweshwaraiya moti baag, lekin vahaan bhashaa sambandhi ek samasya he
 
 
 The front of the station building and large boards with names on both sides are covered
 
 
 kuch din pehle tak saamne vaala or ek kone vaala naam galat likhaa tha, or duusare kone main vah sahi likhaa gaya tha
 
 
 It was always thought that someone's attention would go to it at some time, and it would be fixed
 
 
 lekin sabase dilachasp tathy yah he ki dhyaan to gaya, lekin galat ko sahi karne ke sthaan par jo sahi tha, use bhi galat kar diya gaya
 
 
 Dr
 Visvesvaraya was named M
 in two of the first three places
 vishweshwaraiyya likhaa tha, or tisare sthaan par ise sahi - vishweshwaraiya - likhaa gaya tha
 
 
 And now instead of correcting the wrong in two places, the third has also been changed to 'vishveshvaraya'
 
 
 hansi aati he - kaise-kaise vidwaan baithe hai
 
 
 My personal view is that the most important to learn any language is the practice of reading material beyond the syllabus
 
 
 sirf paathyakram main maujuud pustakon ko padhane se aap vishay ke rup main hindi ko sikh sakate hai, lekin hindi kii vyapak shabdaawalee or uskaa alankaarik or vibhinn roopon main prayog aap tabhi seekhenge, jab aap paathyakram se baahar nikalakar kuch padhenge
 
 
 By reading one of the novels of Munshi Premchand included in the syllabus, you will never know what issues he wrote, what and how
 
 
 aaj kaa yug vaise bhi mobile or tablet par padhane kaa yug ho gaya he, or kindel par kitaaben padhane ke shaukeenon kii taadaad lagaataar bad rahi he, so, hindi kaa pathak vaise hi alpsankhyak ho gaya he
 
 
 i still believe that before going to bed at night and sleeping on the chest and reading the book, the peace, the happiness, the satisfaction that it gives, cannot be found on the Kindle
 
 
 puraani-nai kitabon kii jild kii alag-si gandh aaj bhi padhane kaa shauk zindaa rakhe hue he
 
 
 So, i just want to tell you now, make a habit of reading something yourself, and let your children see what you are doing, so that they too can become like that
 
 
 or yakeen maniye, agar aisa ho paaya, to hindi kii dasha sudhaarney ke liye har saal manaae jane vaale hindi diwas kii zarurat nahin rahegi

 People are tweeting, retweeting and sharing it
 'aaj tak' kii team ne is tasviir kii puri padtaal kii or phir chaunkaane vaala sach saamne aayaa
 In fact, in the black and white picture in the viral picture, it is seen that scientist APJ Abdul Kalam is informing Indira Gandhi about a space program which Indira Gandhi is deluded to understand, and he is standing near the young man Narendra Modi
 twit kii ja rahi tasviir main kaha ja rahaa he ki narendra modi kishoravastha se hi isro kaarykram main madad kiya karte the

 to kya vaaki modi the indira gandhi ke kareebi? kya indira, modi ko shaamil karti thim antariksh program main? 'aaj tak' ne is blike and white tasviir kii puri kundali taiyaar karne ke liye viral test kiya
 In the black and white picture, Narendra Modi seems to be young, which means that the picture is quite old

 He made it clear that Indira Gandhi and Narendra Modi had never met, so this viral picture is someone's prank and this picture failed in our investigation

 Initially many people had a lot of difficulty going in because in view of the crowd, people were being advised to go in turn by laying lines at the Chief Minister's residence

 Mukesh Kumar from Nangloi who has served in the Home Guard (he has been retired) Mukesh Kumar also met Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and spoke
 mukesh kumaar ne kaha- mukhyamantri ne aashwaasan diya he ki 24 ghante ke bheetar hi home gardon kii bhartee ko lekar sarkaar aadesh jari karegi
 Similarly, some old Aam Aadmi Party workers from outside Delhi also came to meet the Chief Minister with the complaint of their local leaders that they had a complaint to give Gajanand a ticket in place of Ramchandra from Bawana Assembly seat, according to the activists - on this issue Kejriwal They did not give any assurance
 tippaniyan Guest teachers were also among those who met
 mukhyamantri se aamane saamne baat karke unhen santushti to thi lekin vah mukhyamantri dwaara die gaye aashwaasan se santusht nahin hai
 At the same time, the Health Department employees came to meet the Chief Minister and demanded that the jobs be confirmed, but the common people who brought their problems to the Delhi Secretariat had to be disappointed, because any minister or officer in the Delhi Secretariat had time for public
 It was not decided that due to which people came here, they were asked whether they had an appointment? asal main pichhali baar 2014 main dilli sachivalay main janata darbar lagaakar kejariwal funs gaye the, kyonki badi taadaad main janata vahaan aa gai or kaarykram safal nahin ho paaya isliye is baar vikendrikrut tareeke se is kaarykram ko karne kaa faisla kiya gaya, lekin ye kahin nahin bataaya gaya ki koun adhikari kahaan uplabdh hoga yaa koun mantri subah kahaan milegaa, jisase bhram kii sthiti bani

 In fact, the last time in 2014, Kejriwal got trapped in the Delhi Secretariat by holding Janata Durbar, because a large number of people came there and the program could not succeed, so this time it was decided to do this program in a decentralized way, but nowhere else
 It was told that which officer will be available or which minister will meet in the morning, due to which there was confusion

 ek vyakti, ek pad ke siddhant ke chalate pandeya zyada din tak adhyaksh pad par nahin rahenge
 To find a new president, the BJP needs only one person who fits all the figures

 Before the 2017 assembly elections, BJP had made Keshav Prasad Maurya the state president and this experiment of BJP was very successful

 modi sarkaar ne apane antim purna bajet main sabase zyada dhyaan kisaanon or gaanvon par diya he
 On one hand, a huge proposal of 11 lakh crore has been made for the farmers to get out of debt, on the other hand separate schemes have been made to help the small farmers
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne bajet main aise tamaam praavdhaan kiye hai jo chunaav main jane se pehle sarkaar ke haath majboot kar sakate hai
 In the Budget, the Annadata, who was well remembered, used to use the word farmer more than the budget in his budget, he used the word village less than that, and used the word agriculture
 is bajet ne saaf kar diya he ki sarkaar kii najar kahaan he or kyon hai
 The government has so far failed miserably on the agricultural front
 desh ke anek hisson main aatmahatyaayein badi hai
 The price of the produce is not available
 kabhi tamaato, kabhi aalu to kabhi duusari subjiyan phenke jane kii ghatnaayen saamne aati rahi hai
 This was the last opportunity for the government to put forth a bright image of their concerns against these pictures
 or sarkaar ne ise ganvaaya nahin
 In its last budget, the government has tried to make someone happy, then they are farmers, and for this the government has opened the door from the heart to the treasure
 - gaanvon kii dasha sudhaarney ke liye 14
 5 lakh crore has been provisioned
 isamen se 11 lakh karod kaa istemaal kisaanon ko karj dene ke liye
 - Farmers will also be brought under the Kisan Credit Card
 - kisaanon kii upaj ke istemaal ke liye 42 mega food park banenge
 500 crore Operation Green Fund to increase potato-onion production
 - garib pariwaron ko 2 karod nae shauchalay banaakar die jaaenge
 - There will be a provision of 10 thousand crores for the development of Internet in villages
 - 2022 tak har garib ko ghar dene kaa purana vaada doharaaya gaya he
 The government has decided that this rain on the farmers before going to the elections will also raise the hopes of its return to power
 iske alaava ujjwala yojana ke tahat muft gas conection dene ke lakshya ko 5 karod se badhaakar 8 karod tak kar diya gaya he
 Provision has been made to open 5 lakh new primary health centers
 86 fisad chote kisaanon kii upaj kii kharid ke liye alag se dhaancha banane kaa elaan kiya he
 Will the days of farmers change? After the budget, the Prime Minister said that the country cannot be taken in the right direction without improving the condition of the farmers and for this a provision has been made openly in the budget
 to kahani ye he ki is bajet se kisaan chaahe to khush ho saktaa he
 But the problem is that most of the government's schemes are of long duration, and till the time they understand the benefits, elections will come
 bajet main kisaanon ke liye saugatsarkaar ne kisaanon ke liye itnaa hi nahin kiya he, usne puraa bajet is tarah se banaaya he ki har tarah ke kisaan ko achche kaa ehsaas ho
 Young farmer will get wifi, big farmer will get foodpark and small farmers will get reasonable price
 in vaadon par kisaan kitne fida honge ye to nahin pataa lekin sarkaar ne ise krantikari bataaya he
 Significantly, the farmers had the highest expectations from the budget
 sarkaar se sabase zyada naaraaz bhi vahi hai, kyonki 2014 main jin vaadon ke saath modi sarkaar satta main ai thi unamem se zyaadaatar vaade adhure hai
 Therefore, this budget was seen as a mistake for him
 ab jabaki sarkaar ne apni taraf se sudhaar kar liya he sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya salbhar main is sudhaar se kisaanon kii dasha bhi sudhan jaaegi

 The MCD says that where the MCD earns, it cannot be given for free picket demonstration

 After 24 hours of political drama, Nitish Kumar has sworn in as the Chief Minister of Bihar once again
 nitish ke saath hi susheel modi ne upmukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 Now the challenge before Nitish Kumar is to present majority in the assembly
 28 july ko vidhansabha main bahumat pesh karnaa he
 Sushil Modi has claimed that the BJP and JDU have the support of 132 mlas, but there are frequent rebellions in the JDU
 media reports kii maane, to jadyu ke 71 main 18 vidhayak rajd kaa samarthan kar sakate hai
 Of these, 5 mlas are Muslim and 11 mlas are from Yadav community
 do anya vidhayak bhi rajd ke sampark main hai
 Party MLA Bijendra Yadav said that the people of Bihar had chosen Nitish and Lalu together
 ab nitish ke paas sabase badi chunauti bahumat kii hi he
 Who has how many seats - Total seats - 243 for majority - 122 JDU - 71 BJP + - 58 RJD - 80 Congress - 27 others - 7 In JDU, the decision of rebellion Surneetish Kumar has opposed former JDU President Sharad Yadav and Rajya Sabha MP Ali Anwar

 Ali Anwar said that there were signs of going with the BJP for the last several days, the National Council meeting was to be held on July 23 but was canceled
 agar main baithak main hota to is baat ko jarur saamne rakhata
 Although JDU leader KC Tyagi has spoken to Sharad Yadav over the phone, trying to persuade him
 aise main ankon kaa ganit mahatvurna ho jaataa he
 Sharad Yadav has his own influence on JDU mlas
 ali anwar bihar main pasmanda kii raajnneeti karte rahe hai
 Nitish Kumar sent him to the Rajya Sabha, but Ali Anwar's displeasure shows that all is not well in the JDU
 lalu dikhaaenge takat?duusari ore jab se sharad yadav se jediu ke adhyaksh pad kii jimmedaari nitish ne apane kandhe par lee
 Nobody is going to ask Sharad Yadav

 chif justise ranjag gogoi ne poocha ki sibiai nideshak ke adhikaar waapas lene pehle sellection cameti kii salaah lene main kya mushkil thi? supreme court ne is maamle main apana faisla surakshit rakh liya he
 During the debate, Justice KM Joseph said that as per the rule, the CBI director should remain in office for two years
 justise joseph ne senior vakil dushyant dave se kaha ki vah sivisi act ke bare main padhein, jisamen kamishnar ke hataane kii baat he lekin kabhi sibiai diarector ko hataane kii baat nahin he
 Actually, Dave is arguing that the CVC does not have the authority to investigate the CBI
 unhone kaha ki is maamle main centre sarkaar ne sibiai kii swytta kaa dhyaan nahin rakhaa he
 
 
 
 jab court room main lage thahaakecongress netaa mallikarjun khadge kii taraf se kapil sibbal ne kaha ki sibiai sirf bhrashtachar hi nahin balki aarushi, hatya jaise kai maamalon kaa nipataara karata he
 Meanwhile, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi intercepted him and said that we also give the cases which we give to CBI
 is dauraan court main joro ke thahaake lage
 Starting the debate on Thursday, SG Tushar Mehta said that the case of members of All India Services is settled under Section 8 (2) of the CVC Act, 2003
 sawaal yah he ki sibiai kaa nideshak banane ke baad kya koi vyakti akhil bhartiya sevaayen kaa sadsy rahata he? police act main aisa kahi nahin likhaa ki jis vyakti kii yogyata nideshak banane kii he use police seva par lagu hone vaale niyamon se chhot he
 In response, CJI Ranjan Gogoi said that Alok Verma's argument is that any action to withdraw his rights is contrary to the Vineet Narayan Judgment and to do so requires the approval of the Selection Committee
 sijeai ne tushaar mehta se kaha ki sibiai nideshak ke adhikaar waapas lene pehle sellection cameti kii salaah lene main kya mushkil thi? jiske jawaab main SG ne kaha ki yah transfar kaa maamla nahin tha
 Then CJI said what was the difficulty in getting the advice of the selection committee? SG Tushar Mehta said that the director is a member of the All India Service
 jisapar sijeai ne kaha beshak
 Tushar Mehta said that suppose an officer is caught on camera taking a bribe and has to be suspended immediately, then in such a situation, the central government has the right
 solicytor general tushaar mehta ne donon adhikari gambhir maamalon kii jaanch karne ke bajaay ek duusare kii jaanch kar rahe thea
 cvcs are accountable to Parliament
 jis par sijeai gogoi ne poocha ki kya sibiai ke maamle main sivisi kii jaanch bhashtachar virdohi kanoon se aage ja sakati he
 Tushar Mehta then referred to the complaint sent to the Cabinet Secretary's CVC in July, saying that the cvc's action was not sudden, the matter was already going on
 atorni general keke venugopal ne kaha ki ham ucch stareey cameti ke samaksh isliye nahin gaye kyonki yah transfar se judaa maamla nahin tha
 If we had gone before the committee, she would have asked why this matter is being put before us? It is the petty argument of the petitioner that the matter is related to transfer
 venugapal ne kaha ki sivisi har maheene sibiai ke saath meeting karata hai
 Because CVC continues to receive complaints against officers
 lihaaja is apratyaashit sthiti se nipatane ke liye yah karrwai upyukt thi
 appearing on behalf of the CBI , said that an officer can be transferred prematurely only after the committee's recommendation
 haalanki yah niyam mahaj transfar tak simit he
 Arguing on behalf of Special Director Rakesh Asthana, Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi said that the Central Government has the right to appoint, transfer, except 2-year minimum term - suspension, departmental inquiry and dismissal
 is par sijeai ne rohtagi se kaha ki aap asthana ke vakil kii tarah tark na den
 Senior advocate Fali Nariman, on behalf of CBI Director Alok Verma, said that under any circumstances he should seek the advice of Samiti
 is maamle main tabadale kaa matlab seva ke nyaayakshetra main tabadalaa nahin he
 Transfer does not simply mean transfer of one place to another
 centre sarkaar ke aadesh ke mutabik verma ke adhikaron ko waapas le liya gaya he
 According to the order of the CVC, the corruption case was kept away from investigation
 kaaryon ke adhikaar se vanchit rakhana bhi transfar he
 The responsibility of the CBI director has been transferred to the interim director
 yah bhi transfar hi he
 Nariman said that the issue is not to continue in office, to remain in office
 isse pehle buudhvaar ko centre kii taraf se court main kaha gaya ki sibiai ke do sheersh str ke afasaron ke bich kii ladaai saarvajanik hone se desh kii pramukh jaanch agency kii chhavi kharaab ho rahi thi
 For this reason, the Center had to intervene to save the credibility of the CBI
 gauratlab he kii sibiai ke nideshak alok verma ne supreme court main centre dwaara chuttee par bheje jane ke faisle ko chunauti di he
 Alok Verma argues in the court that the rules were not followed before his removal, as the decision to remove the director of CBI is made by a committee
 lekin unke bare main is tarah kii kisi bhi cameti se mashvira nahin liya gaya
 At the same time, the Center argues in the case that special director Rakesh Asthana had a complaint before the CVC against Alok Verma and he was sent on leave based on the recommendation of the CVC
 vahiin, buudhvaar ko atorni general keke venugopal ne supreme ko bataaya ki sibiai ke do sheersh adhikari alok verma or rakesh asthana kii ladaai saarvajanik ho chuki thi
 Due to which the image of the major investigating agency was being tarnished, due to which the trust of the people was diminishing
 venugopal ne kaha ki centre sarkaar or sivisi ko yah faisla karnaa tha ki koun sahi he or koun galat? isi vajah se sivisi kii sifarish par centre ko dakhal dena padaa or donon sheersh adhikariyon ko jaanch puri hone chuttee par bhejnaa padaa
 He told the court that Alok Verma was not removed, but sent on leave
 kya he maamla?aapako bataa den ki sibiai ke do sheersh afasaron ke rishwatakhori vivaad main funsane ke baad 23 oktober ko centre ne jwoint diarector em nageshwar raav ko antarim nideshak niyukt kar diya tha
 With this, Director Alok Verma and Special Director Rakesh Asthana were sent on leave and some other officers were transferred till the investigation was completed
 darasal, rakesh asthana or unki team ke ek dspi par meet kaarobaari moin kuraishi kii jaanch maamle main vyapaaree satish sanaa ke maamle ko rafa- dfa karne ke liye rishwat lene kaa aarope he
 At the same time, Asthana alleges that the bribe was not taken by Alok Verma

 In Samastipur, Bihar, a person has died in aerial firing of police on people blocking the national highway
 gussai bheed ne thane par patharav kiya or kai vaahanon main todphod bhi kii
 Two people have also been injured during this period
 ye log tajpur main dawa kaarobaari kii goli markar hatya kiye jane or naaballig ladki ke apharan ko lekar virodh kar rahe the
 People also attacked SAP Key
 aapako bataa den ki guuruuvaar ko tajpur ilaake main dawa kaarobaari janardan thakur kii goli markar hatya kii gai thi
 The Tajpur area of samastipur turned into a battlefield when villagers blocked the road on the patna-samastipur National Highway-28 and were protesting against the police
 2 din pehle tajpur ke rahane vaale dawa vyavsaai janardan thakur kii aparaadhiyon ne goli markar hatya kar di thi or is hatya se 2 din pehle hi aparaadhiyon ne ek sthaneey ladki ko bhi agava kar liya tha jiskaa ab tak suraag nahin laga he
 The villagers, angered by both these incidents, blocked National Highway 28 on Friday and shouted slogans against the police
 pradarshnakariyon kaa aarope tha ki in donon ghatnaon ko lekar police ne ab tak koi kaarywahi nahin kii he or aparaadhiyon ko ab tak giraftaar nahin kiya gaya he
 On receiving the information about the incident, Additional Superintendent of Police Aamir Javed and SDO Ashok Mandal reached the spot and tried to negotiate with the villagers so that movement could be restored on National Highway 28, but the angry villagers attacked these two officers
 graminon ne in donon adhikariyon par patharbaji kii or laathiyon se khaded kar bhaga diya
 The attack has resulted in serious injuries to both officers and is being treated at a local hospital
 tajpur main halaat bekaabu hote dekh aas paas ke sabhi thanon se atirikt police bal ko bulaayaa gaya taaki halaat ko sambhala ja sake
 To control the situation, the villagers also attacked the police and came to stone
 iske baad graminon ne tajpur thane par bhi patharav kiya or aadhe darjan gadiyon ko aag ke hawaale kar diya
 In view of the tense situation on the spot, 15 rounds of aerial firing were also carried out by the police, in which a villager named Jitendra Kumar was shot and died while going to the hospital
 baad main samastipur police adheekshak deepak ranjan dal bal ke saath tajpur pahunche or unhone updraviyon ko khaded khaded kar bhagaaya
 Flag march was carried out on behalf of the police to restore peace in the area
 police philhal puure ilaake main vaise updraviyon kii talash kar rahi he jo is hinsa main shaamil the
 Superintendent of Police Deepak Ranjan also denied that the villager, Jitendra Kumar, died after being shot in the police firing
 deepak ranjan ne kaha ki sabase pehle police par firing updraviyon ke taraf se hui thi or isi firing main gramin kii maut hui
 Tensions remain at Tajpur and police are camping

 One by one statements are coming from the side and the opposition, in which the former finance minister and former BJP leader Yashwant Sinha has attacked the central government
 yashavanth simha ne twit kar likhaa he "CAA ke virodh me chal rahe andolan ke khilaaf shaasha kii bhashaa vahi he jo 1974 / 75 main jepi andolan ke khilaaf kiya tha, itihaas khud ko kaise doharaata he"
 Language being used by rulers today against the anti-caa movement is the same that was used by the rulers against the JP movement in 1974 / 75
 How history repeats itself
 Let me tell you that Yashwant Sinha is constantly angry with the central government, earlier he had strongly criticized the government after the removal of Section 370 in CAA and Kashmir
 yashavanth sinha ne kashmir main dhara 370 hataae jane ke baad kashmir kaa daura bhi karnaa chaha tha lekin unhen airport se hi waapas bhej diya gaya tha

 dilli metro kii nai line yani magenta line shuru hone ja rahi he, jo janakapuri west or noida ke botanical garden ke bich chalegi
 However, in the initial phase, the metro will be started between Kalkaji Mandir to Botanical Garden
 is hisse main metro banakar taiyaar he
 All the testing has also been completed and now the papers have been sent to the Metro Rail Safety Commissioner for final approval
 iske baad siemares is line kaa nirikshan karenge or phir hari jhandi milane ke baad logon ke liye metro line khol di jaaegi
 Let us now tell you what is unique and unique about this new line? First thing was train
 
 
 is line kaa color code hoga magenta or sabhi metro train par magenta color kii pattee lagi hogi
 The special thing is that this will be the best and advanced technology train in the world
 ye train utio yani aptended train aaparishan takanic se las hogi matlab inhen bina driver ke bhi chalaaya ja sakegaa
 However, DMRC will run the train with the driver for the initial one year
 duusari sabase badi khaasiyat ye hogi ki isamen back-tu-back train chalaai ja sakengi or nabbe second kii frequency par train chal sakegi
 This will allow more and more passengers to travel to Metro
 metro dabl door systamis metro line par sabhi steshnon par platform or train ke bich dabl door system hoga
 Platform screen doors have been installed for this
 aisa karne se train oparation aasaan hoga ormetrosteshnon par hone vaali suicide kii ghatnaon ko roka ja sakegaa
 These platform screen doors will open only after stopping on the platform of Metro and will be closed as the train leaves
 metro ke afasaron ke mutabik isse bheed kii vajah se train ke daravaaje band nahin hone kii ghatnaon par bhi roak lagegi
 Interchange facility between Blue Line and Violet Line: The opening of the Magenta Line between Kalkaji Mandir to Botanical Garden will facilitate interchange at two stations
 isse noida or faridabad ke bich safar aasaan hoga or zyada nahin ghoomana padegaa
 Because people coming from Faridabad at Kalkaji Mandir station can take the train with Botanical Garden directly to Noida
 ab tak unhen mandi house jaakar noida ke liye train badalani padati thi
 Similarly, people going from Noida to Kalkaji used to change the train from Mandi House to visit Khan Market Lajpat Nagar, but now one can get the train directly from the Botanical Garden
 isse yatra kaa samay aadha ho jayega
 The Delhi government did not put any new tax burden on the common man in its budget
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne apni sarkaar ke bajet ko garibon or madhyamvarg ke liye hitkar bataaya he

 vaai-faai par model taiyaar nahinmukhyamantri ne saaf kiya ki vaai-faai par jaanboojhkar bajet main koi ghoshnaa nahin kii gayi he
 He said that so far we have not been able to decide any model on wi-fi
 kejariwal ne kaha ki vaai-faai kaa sapana saakaar karne main ham koi jaldbaaji nahin karnaa chaahate
 So Delhi will definitely get free wi-fi but will have to wait a bit for that
 swasthya or shiksha praathamiktakejariwal ne kaha ki bacchon ke liye shiksha or sabake liye swasthya hameshaa se unki sarkaar kii praathamikta rahaa he
 The condition of government schools in Delhi has changed radically

 ellection bajet kahana galatkejariwal ne kaha ki unki sarkaar dilli ke liye acha kaam kar rahi he or usee kaam ko aage badhaane kii bajet main koshish kii gayi he
 Therefore, it is not right to call it an election budget
 rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot in khabaron se khinn bataae ja rahe hai ki rahul gandhi unase khaase naaraaz hai kyonki gahalot ne apana puraa dhyaan bete vaibhav gahalot ko jitaane ke liye jodhpur main lagaaya or anya pratyaashiyon ke liye prachaar par utana dhyaan nahin diya
 He admitted that the high command's displeasure at the party's performance was justified, but also said that "what Rahul said was not reported in the media, it is unethical to publicize half-truths
" ''gahalot kii yah pratikriya bataati he ki ve apane pratidwandviyon khaskar up-mukhyamantri sachin payalat se bhidde ke mood main hai
 He even asked the pilot to review Vaibhav's defeat
 gahalot ne kaha ki payalat ne hi vaibhav kii ummidavaari kii sifarish kii thi or jeet kii guarantee dilaai thi
 However, the pilot surprised the Chief Minister's statement
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki donon ke bich thanegi or gahalot unhen do main se ek pad se mukt karne kii maang alaakaman se kar sakate hai
 At the moment, rivals in Gehlot's party are getting aggressive on him and the opposition BJP has left no stone unturned to add fuel to the fire
 gahalot samarthak iske liye payalat ko jimmedaar maanate hai
 Not only this, one minister resigned (which was rejected by Gehlot), two spoke of introspection and Congress MLA Harish Meena, who had been the state's DGP for most of his second term, sat on a fast for two days
 went
 meena avaidh ret khanan main shaamil ek tractor chaalak ke parijanon ke liye naukari kii maang kar rahe hai, jisaki tonk jile ke nagar kile main police ke peechha karne ke dauraan maut ho gai
 Tourism Minister Vishvendra Singh also sat on a dharna and transferred several police officers in his hometown Bharatpur accusing the police officers of massive corruption
 gahalot ke khilaaf abhi bhale hi maahaul ho saktaa he, lekin ve pehle bhi kai baar aise halaat se nibat chuke hai or pratidwandviyon ko shikast de chuke hai
 This is his third term as Chief Minister
 loksabhaa chunaav bhi khatm ho gaya he
 Despite his failure to win the election, Gehlot enjoys the trust of the nehru-gandhi family due to his loyalty and political acumen
 gahalot apane sabase mukhar aalochakon se bhi milane pahunch rahe hai jo yah darshata he ki unhone apni puraani pravriti ke vipareet, apane rukh badlaav kiya he
 He has isolated the notorious troupe of his old tenure and is constantly facing all kinds of media questions
 unhone samaajawaadee rujhaan bhi dikhaaya
 On May 27, Police Day in Jaipur invited social activist Aruna Roy to address the officers and on 2 June her laborers arrived in Bhilwara district to attend the Kisan Shakti Sangathan Sammelan
 gahalot ne apana prashasnic agenda bhi jari rakhaa he
 The sale of hookahs containing e-cigarettes and crawlers has been banned and they are advocating a national policy against tobacco and alcohol
 ve apane duusare kaarykaal ke dauraan shuru kii gai sarkari aspataalon main mukrat generik davaaiyaan uplabdh karaane kii avadharana ko aage badhaate hue sasti swasthya sevaaon ko badhaava dene par jor de rahe hai
 The Chief Minister is focusing on improving the public distribution system with the help of some middle-class skilled officers
 gahalot ne police, khanan adhikariyon, thekedaaron or sthaneey netaaon kii santhganth ko todgaye kaa iraadaa bhi dikhaaya he, jinhone supreme court ke khanan pratibandh adeshon kaa ulanghan karke lakhon kaa khanan kiya he
 He took action as soon as he received a notice of delay in action against the gang rape accused from a young Dalit woman in Alwar
 unhone rajya main sabhi balaatkaar or police atyaacharon ke maamalon kii bhi report maangi he or balaatkaar jaise aparaadhon ke liye jila police pramukhon ko apane karyaalay main exiar darj karne kii anumati dene jaise kuch nae badlaav kii shuruyaat kii he
 Insiders say that his next focus will be on infrastructure development, although the state's financial situation has shrunk due to farm debt waiver and other election announcements
 iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki gahalot kii payalat se adaavat main sab kuch saamaanya hone laga he
 Gehlot's methods of being patient and working calmly have been useful, but the young pilot's quiver also has many arrows
 *** Light plays the most important role in making the house beautiful and attractive
 sundar lite ghar main shantipurna maahaul banaaen rakhane main sabase khaas hoti he
 Also, an intelligent light saves both electricity and money, so it is important that some things are taken care of before putting the light

 The opposition said that the person who is giving a fifth of his earnings to the government in the form of income tax, how can he be considered economically weak, or in other words what the government is referring to as 'poor' in the reservation law
 How can she collect 20 per cent tax from it
 so, ab agar koi shaks bank se milane vaale byaaj sahit kul 6,60,000 rupee kama rahaa he, or 80si ke tahat dedh lakh rupee kaa nivesh bhi kar rahaa he, to use katai koi tex nahin dena hoga

 Noor arrives in Kashmir with his mother and stepfather in the film
 yahaan wo dada (kulbhushan kharbanda) or daadi (soni razdan) ke paas aati he
 Noor was told that his father had left home many years earlier
 lekin kashmir pahunchakar use pataa chalata he ki pita ko kai saal pehle bhartiya sena ne uthaa liya tha or phir wo kabhi ghar nahin laute
 After this, she sets out to find her father

 vahaan sena ke jawan unhen aatankwaadi samaj kar pakad lete hai
 However, Noor is let go because of British citizenship
 lekin maajid ko hiraasat main rakhaa jaataa he
 With this, all the ups and downs are seen in the film
 kya nur hamid ko nirdosh sabit karke vahaan se nikaal paaegi? yaa nur apane papa ke bare main kuch jaan paaegi? ye jaanane ke liye film dekhni hogi
 By the way, you will understand the story of the film only after seeing and hearing it

 bhaajapa kai siton par trinmul congress se maamuli antar se pichhadi
 Troubled by the rise of BJP in state politics, Trinamool Congress President and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is trying to find ways to stop it
 uttar 24 pargana jile ke naihati nagarpalika ke saamne dharna de raheen mamata ne blaak str par banga janani vahini or jai hind vahini ke gathan kaa elaan kiya he

 Whatever may be the reason, but it is certain that with the help of dharna, the Didi, who has traveled to the top in the state politics, is once again looking for lost strength with the help of dharna

 ahmedabad ke krime branch ke assistant police kamishnar rajdipasingh jhaalaa ke mutabik pehle to yah log police ke paas aana nahin chaahate the, kyonki khud bhi funs sakate the
 Initially, Informant's father tried to make money, but Jaideep's wife got nervous
 use laga ki uskaa pati shaayad musiibat main funs saktaa he, isliye maamla police main chalaa gaya
 The comments police ne apharan kaa puraa maamla sulajhaa liya or teen vyapaariyon samet unke chaar sahaayakon ko bhi giraftaar kar liya he
 Now the case of illegal money along with kidnapping will also be investigated
 jhaalaa kaa kahana he ki yah maamla gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se paisa badalawaane kaa bhi he
 The police has solved the kidnapping case but the money loot case is still not solved

 But this incident is also opening up layers of misconduct to change money after demonetisation
 notebandi ke baad ve sabhi pareshaan the jinke paas badi maatra main cash tha
 Gujarat businessmen Pankaj Soni, Umesh Patel and Jignesh Pandya also had Rs 35 lakhs to replace their friends Jaideep and Suchit with 30 per cent commission
 jayadeep ne apane 12 lakh rupee jode or 47 lakh rupee badalawaane ke liye police se bachane ke liye paise apni patni ko de die
 He was asked to reach another area
 raste main khud ko police bataane vaale logon ne is mahila ko lut liya or faraar ho gaye
 When Jaideep told this to the traders, these traders could not believe Jaideep
 thode dinon baad apane paise waapas ugaahne ke iraade se in teenon vyapaariyon ne anya chaar logon ke saath milakar jayadeep or suchit kaa apharan kar liya
 According to Rajdeep Singh Jhala, Assistant Police Commissioner, Crime Branch, Ahmedabad, at first, these people did not want to come to the police, because they themselves could be trapped
 shuruyaat main suchit ke pita ne paison kaa jugad karne kii koshish kii lekin jayadeep kii patni ghabara gai
 She felt that her husband might be in trouble, so the matter went to the police
 tippaniyan The police settled the entire kidnapping case and arrested four of his assistants, including three businessmen
 ab apharan ke saath-saath gaiyrkanoonee paise ke maamle kii bhi jaanch hogi
 Jhala says that this is also a case of illegally converting money
 police ne apharan kaa maamla to sulajhaa liya he lekin paison kii lut ke maamle kii gutthi ab bhi nahin sulajhi he
 Currently the kidnapped businessman is not coming in front of the media for fear of police action
 lekin is ghatana se notebandi ke baad paise badalawaane ke liye hue gorakhdhandhon kii paraten bhi khul rahi hai
