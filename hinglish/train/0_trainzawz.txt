 This 46-year-old woman lives in the same street of Ramnagar village in Mainpuri where Shivivkumarrahta is
 mahila kaa kahana he ki shiv kumaar use chachee bulaata tha
 After this incident, her husband silenced her for fear of slander
 yahaan tak ki uske ghar se nikalne par bhi roak laga di gai thi
 The victim says that Shivkumar raped her at gunpoint in August 2013
 aaropee ke gaanv main ye iklauti mahila hi nahin he jo shiv kumaar yadav kaa shikaar hui
 Two other women from the village also told a similar story

 She is angry because when she went to ask for the job, she was offered the job of a sergeant
 mairi nae sire se apni uplabdhiyon kii file sanvaar rahi he, taaki kahin or applai kar sake
 Then one of his children starts crying
 mairi file chhod detii he
 The child picks up
 baccha jis akhbaar par baitha tha, us par mairi kaa photo chapa tha
 Photo of the World Championship final
 mairi ke final panch kaa photo
 But now the child Susu on it
 akhbaar raddi ho gaya
 And maybe career too
 magar mairi vaapasi karti he
 But the film drama and the emotion that Susu did on the film's story, the film Mary Kom does not make a comeback
 bachche kii beemaari yaa baap kii naaraazgi ko jabaran boxing ring main mairi kii haar yaa jeet se jod diya jaataa he
 The film Mary Kom is a duel victim
 ye cheez uski takat bhi ban saktaa tha basharte kahani thik se gadhi gai ho
 Mary is a woman
 mairi ek boxr
 The two lines cannot run simultaneously
 magar mairi aisa karti he
 In this, his toughness is hidden
 wo ring main muqabla karti he
 Panipudi loves to eat
 coach kii marji ke khilaaf jaakar shaadi karti he
 Children also do
 or phir apni jid ke chalate vaapasi bhi
 But in order to show all these shades in the film Mary Kom, the story often gets dull
 usamen sirf tabhi gati aati he, jab mairi ring main hoti he yaa apane coach ke saath practice kar rahi hoti he
 This stagnation of the story is always very revealing
 bachche hone ke baad mairi kaa apane medal samet bakse main rakhana
 Or burn hands with a hot frying pan
 baharhaal, mairicom sirf ek ausat kahani bhar nahin he
 This is also a sample of Priyanka Chopra's brilliant acting
 unhone skool kii gussell ladki, ek bhavuk beti, ek majboot boxr or ek pyaari patni kaa role achche se nibhaayaa he
 Looking at the film, it seems that no one can play the role of boxer Mary Kom better than Priyanka
 unke chehre par, khaskar practice ke vakt yaa federation ke daftar ke baahar intjaar ke vakt jo ek parat ke neeche chipa tikhaapan najar aata he, vah kirdaar ko bahut yakeen detaa he
 Renowned artist Sunil Thapa has done a great job in the role of Priyanka's coach
 unhen dekhakar ek baargi to doga ke kirdaar vaali comics main unke guru bane adarak chachaa yaad aate hai
 Khalwat head, pointed French beard and mustache, taped in English, but he grew old
 sunil ne ek coach ke bheetar ke maa or baap, donon hi pairahan ko umdaa dhang se odha he
 Priyanka's husband Onlear also stars Darshan Kumar
 bollywood ko aise hi taaje chehron kii darkaar he, jinhen acting bhi aati ho
 The rest of the film's starcast is also good
 dil ye ziddee he ke alaava baaki gane ausat hai
 There is also a trend of playing songs that forcibly sing Indianness in sports films
 magar darshakon ko film ke baad in gaanon kii ek aadh pankti bhi yaad rah jaae to bahut he
 Chak De's pressure appears on Mary Kom, according to this
 film main north east kii kuch nai lokation hai
 The boxing scenes are well shot
 magar over ol match ke pehle kii taiyaari, khilaadiyon ke aapasi rishte or in dauraan upajte neh, tanaav or banati ranneeti ko diarector umang kumaar achche se nahin dikhaa paae
 One of the problems of Mary Kom is that it tries to show everything simultaneously
 federation kii politics, pitaaon kaa betiyon ke prati vyavhaar, shaadi ke baad aurat par zyada boj yaa phir khilaadiyon kaa aapasi manmutav
 This disrupts the concentration of the film
 or vah kai jagah sust or bojhil ho jaati he
 This is particularly unforgivable for a sports film
 or mahapaap hota he aakhir main, jab bilkul bollywood style main bachche kaa oparation chal rahaa he or mairi ring main pit rahi he
 Maricom is a slightly above average film made in the name of a noble intention and great personality
 agar aap khelon ke prati junun rakhte hai yaa apane bacchon main mobile phone chhodkar maidan par pasinaa bahaane kaa utsaah daudana chaahate hai, to ye film dekh sakate hai
 This film is also a must see for those husbands who consider themselves great by allowing their wives to work
 par ve ye bhul jate hai ki saath nibhaane ke vaade sirf itane tak simit nahin
 Scattered storylines and loose screenplays on the film scale have weakened it, as a result, even the best acting could not salvage it

 The Ministry of Home Affairs, while suspending the license, asked this NGO to give its reply within 30 days in respect of violation of various provisions of FCRA

 Denying all allegations, the NGO condemned the government's move and accused the government of harassing the NGO and its officials Indira Jaisingh, Anand Grover

 Film: Director: Rohit Shettystar: Ranveer Singh, Sara Ali Khan, Sonu Sood, Ashutosh Rana and others Certificates: u / a Duration: 2 hours 45 minutes Critics Rating: 1 Audience Ratings: 3
 5chennai express, singhm or golmaal agen jaisi masaaledaar manoranjak filmein banane vaale rohit shetty 2018 ke ant main simba lekar aae hai
 Simba is a remake of South's film Temper
 haalanki isamen hindi audiyans ke hisaab se badlaav bhi kiye gaye hai
 For the first time, Rohit Shetty has made a film with Ranveer Singh and Sara Ali Khan
 isamen unki puraani team, ajay devgan or 2019 main akshay kumaar ke saath suryavanshi kii jhalak bhi he
 Let's know how Ranveer's film has become
 
 
 film kii kahanefilm kii kahani ek police cop kii he
 It starts from the same Shivgarh, where Singham ended
 ek anaath baccha he sangram bhalerao yani simba
 He is in the wrong business, but something happens that he is determined to become a police officer
 afasar bhi isliye bananaa chahta ki powerful ho or zyada se zyada paisa kamaaye
 Howsoever
 galat kaamon ke saath mehnat karte hue parade par noujvaan police afasar simba (ranvir singh) entry maarthe hai
 Simba is a prankster, a tapori and a hero, obviously he is a lover too
 par sharmila or beparwaah, ghoose bhi vasuulata he
 The story is clear in the first two frames of the film with the hero, villain and other characters
 sangram bhalerao kaa tabadalaa durva ranade (sonu sood) ke ilaake main hota he
 Ranade is the powerful dan of Goa
 vah apane bhaaiyon sadashiv or gaurav ranade ke saath drug smagaling se lekar jameen kabjane tak ke tamaam gaiyr kanoonee kaam karata he
 As soon as the new posting arrives, Simba takes Aakriti (vaidehi), a medical student, as her sister, who works to teach orphaned children on the pavement
 simba kii mulaaqaat thane ke saamne cataring kaa bijness chalaane vaali shagun (sara ali khan) se bhi ho jaati he
 At the first sight, Simba gives her heart
 sara ke pita police afasar the or ek encounter main unki maut ho gai thi
 Inspector Tawde, Senior Constable Nityanand Mohile (ashutosh Rana), Constable Dhorkar and all the other characters are introduced
 simba nai posting main aakar ghoosekhori or masakhri jari rakhata he
 Simba starts working for Ranade in exchange for money
 is bich sara ali khan se uski prem kahani bhi aage bad rahi he
 However, Senior Constable Mohile (ashutosh Rana), is angry with Simba and repeatedly warns him to follow the wrong path
 kahani main sabakuch thik thaak chal rahaa he isi bich interval se pehle simba ke saath kuch aisa hota he jo uski jindagi ko badal kar rakh detii he
 What happens to Simba, why he goes against Ranade and why he leaves the way of dishonesty? You will have to go to the film for all these things
 kahani, samvaad, camera or musecsimba jaisi kahaniyaan parde par saikadon baar dikhaai ja chuki hai or pehle frem se hi maaloom ho jaataa he ki agle pal kya hone vaala he
 Yet the story does not bore
 to iske liye rohit shetty ke nirdesan kii tarif honi chahie
 He has kept the pitch of the movie entertaining
 film ke mood ke hisaab se kahani kii jaan darjanon van liner samvaad hai
 For this, Farhad Shamji should be praised
 zyaadaatar samvaad simba yani ranvir singh ke hisse aae hai
 The dialogues on the part of other artists are also sharp, trendy and snooty
 jinhone film nahin dekhi he unhone trailor main isaki jhalak bhi dekhi hogi
 Background score has also become better
 chennai express ko chhod den to rohit shetty kii adhikansh filmon main outdoor lokation zyada myne nahin rakhte
 However, in Simba, he has shot a romantic song over Ranveer and Sara Ali Khan at the best location
 ek do jagah ko chhod di jaae to film kii gati banty negi ke sampaadan kii vajah se thik he

 # SIMMBA 🐅💪🏽 releasing TOMORROW xxrep 4 ! a post shared byranveer Singh(@ranveersingh) ondec 27, 2018 at 4:34am pstkemara work bhi acha he
 Especially the visuals of the action scenes have become very effective
 sirf clymex ke seen ko chhod diya jaae to pehali baar rohit shetty ne apni kisi film main kaaron kaa zyada nuksaan nahin pahunchaaya he
 Aankh Mare has been recreated for the film
 kai or gane bhi hai
 The songs are not of long lifespan but they can be called right given the mood of the film
 kalakaaron kaa abhinay kaisaa he?sara ali khan apni duusari hi film main sabit kar detii hai ki agar unhen screen par badhiya spes mila to wo bahut aage tak jaaengi
 His character was not very big
 lekin wo camere ke saamne acchhee or vishwaas se bhari najar aati hai
 Sarah's eyes don't seem to be acting
 ranvir kaa tapori kirdaar dekhakar kabhi kabhi anil kapur kii yaad aati he
 Simba also has a character similar to Anil's 'ram Lakhan'
 lekin ye utana damdaar nahin he jitani ummid thi or kabhi anil ne use shiddat se parde par nibhaayaa tha
 There are two shades of Ranveer's character before and after Interval
 kirdaar kii demand ke hisaab se donon ko asardaar hona tha, ghoosekhor tapori ke role main ranvir prabhavit nahin karte hai
 In the opening frame, he is seen acting over
 haalanki chutile van liner sanvaadon ne unhen bachaa liya he
 But his every emotion in the character of Angry Youngman appears to be excellent
 wo apni acting kii rau main darshakon ko baha le jate hai
 Sonu Sood has done a good job
 don, bhai pati or pita ke kirdaar main wo jame hai
 But a character similar to Prakash Raj in Singham was not coined in Simba
 ye sonu sood kaa durbhaagya hi kaha jayega
 The performances of Ashutosh Rana, Ashwini Kalsekar, Vipin Sharma, Siddharth Jadhav, Amrit Pal Singh, Naushad Abbas and other actors are also fine according to their length
 rohit shetty ne kis tarah kaa nirdesan kiya he?simba se saafe hota he ki rohit shetty ab nirdesan main duusare level yani family filmon kii ore bad rahe hai
 For the first time in the film, they try to communicate and give a message to the society
 is film main unhone kamedi, imoshan or ection kaa joardaar trikon rachaa he
 In terms of entertainment, his direction can be given a full number, but all things are inconceivable
 jaise unki filmon main abhinetriyon ke liye zyada kuch karne ko nahin rahata
 Deepika Padukone's work in Chennai Express can be considered an exception
 film kii kahani main heroin ke kirdaar ko bada kiya ja saktaa tha
 It was also valid according to the subject
 acha yah hota ki simba kii munhaboli bahan ke kirdaar or sara ali khan ke kirdaar ko mix kar diya jaataa to ek ghoosekhor police afasar main badlaav or uskaa revange aamir khan kii gazani kii tarah behad prabhavi ban padataa
 View this post on instagramthis FRIDAY 💪🏽 # simmbaa post shared byranveer Singh (@ranveersingh) ondec 23, 2018 at 10:58 pm PST The climax could have been improved with Ajay Devgan's entry
 achaanak se ranade badla lene ke liye aage aata he or kuch hi der main uske gunde simba ko uthaa le jate hai
 Singham (ajay Devgan) has an entry to save the helpless Simba
 yahaan aakar ranvir kaa kirdaar marataa najar jaataa he
 There was no shortage of length, if the film is big then it was necessary to make encounter scenes and climax
 in vajahon se kuch jerk aaen hai par acchhee baat yah he ki ve pareshaan nahin karte
 Anyway, where are the films seen in India with both hearts and minds? kul milakar sab thik thaak he
 Don't be surprised if this film makes a big record at the box office
 rohit shetty kah chuke hai ki simba kaa matlab sher kaa baccha hota he or jab baccha sher (singhm) kaa hi he to uski sau galtiyaan maaf
 On the controversy over the visit of European mps in Jammu and Kashmir, the Indian Foreign Ministry says that it is its right to invite the people of civil society
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne kaha ki kai baar log apane nijee yatra par aate hai tab bhi kai baar rashtriya hit main ham unase aadhikarik taur par milte hai bhale hi wo nijee yatra par hon

 There has been a demand to increase the capacity of Nankana Sahib from 3000 devotees to 10,000, but there has been no response from Pakistan on this
 vahiin kashmir ko lekar china ke bayaan par bhi videsh mantralay kii ore se jawaab diya gaya he
 The Foreign Ministry said that China had unauthorizedly annexed Indian territory in Kashmir

 His visit has been mired in controversy
 ek ore to aarope lag rahaa he ki maadi sharma kii naam kii ek mahila ne is saansadon ke is daure kaa puraa intjaam kiya tha or is puri kavayad main unki kya bhoomika thi
 At the same time, Congress says that Indian mps are not being allowed to go there, while Kashmir is being moved to other countries, it is an insult to the Indian Parliament

 Along with this, Advani also attacked the manner of functioning of newspapers, magazines and private news television channels, especially during elections, saying that these media have made such opportunities a means of earning money
 unhone kaha, ‘‘pichley 3-4 chunaavon se main dekh rahaa hum ki is avasar ko patr, patrikaon evam nijee samachar televijan channelon ne paisa kamaane kaa jariya bana liya he or is mudde ko maine nirvachan ayog ke saamne bhi uthaaya he
 The senior BJP leader said that after the last Lok Sabha election result, such an atmosphere was created in some circles, like the BJP has weakened, but in the various elections held in the entire country after this, we have mistaken it on the strength of our performance

 In terms of time, a period of change has started appearing in the Congress
 rahul ke banaae niyam kii gaaj sabase zyada kisi par giri he, to wo kabhi rahul ke chanakya kahe gaye party ke taqatvar mahasachiv digvijay singh hai
 Now Digvijay Singh will have charge of one state only as party general secretary
 mangalvaar ko digvijay singh se telugana rajya kaa prabhaar lekar aarasi khuntia ko saunp diya gaya
 Now Digvijay has only the charge of Andhra Pradesh, where the Congress's existence is in danger
 kabhi rahul ke khaas the digvijay sinhakabhi bataur upi prabharidigvijay sinhako rahul kaa khasmkhas mana jaataa tha
 Digvijay Singh also got the prize of winning the maximum 22 seats in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections in UP
 2012 vidhansabha main upi main kaaphi hip hone ke baad hui haar ne digvijay ke kad par pehali badi chot kii thi
 After this, whether there is a long feud with Anna, Ramdev and Kejriwal or the controversy of Batla House, Digvijay kept on making headlines
 mumbai blast ke shahid hemanth karkare se baatcheet kaa saboot dikhaakar digvijay ne us vakt apane aalochakon ko shant kiya tha
 The then Home Minister p Chidambaram was even said to be intellectually arrogant, but nothing deterred him
 haalanki, muslim tushtikaran ke aarope or tamaam bayaan digvijay ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab bhi banate rahe
 Digvijay himself gave suggestions for change In the meantime, there was a lot of buzz in the social media about Digvijay's personal life
 pehali patni ke nidhan ke baad unhone duusari shaadi bhi kar lee
 First lost in elections in 2003 after being the CM of Madhya Pradesh for ten years, then Digvijay, who declared no contest for ten years, was made the General Secretary of the Congress after the formation of the UPA government
 2014 aate-aate chunaav nahin ladane ke elaan ke 10 saal puure hue the ki sonia ne digvijay ko rajyasabha bhej diya
 It was a reward for Digvijay's strength and loyalty to the Gandhi family
 lekin loksabhaa main badi haar ke baad congress ke bheetar badlaavon kii maang tej hui, to khud digvijay ne sonia se rahul ko adhyaksh banane or nae logon ko sanghathan main jagah dene kii maang karke mahasachiv pad chhodane kii peshkash kar di
 Meanwhile, Sonia and Rahul also accepted the changes in the organization's rules as suggested by Digvijay
 khud kahi telugana chhodane kii baataraahul gandhi party sanghathan ke liye niyam banaaya ki ek netaa ko ek pradesh kaa hi prabhaar milegaa
 Under this, several in-charge of a state like RPN Singh and PL Punia were appointed within the Congress recently
 scindia sareekhe netaa ko bhi mahasachiv banaakar sirf himachal kaa hi prabhaar diya gaya
 Before Digvijay, the party withdrew the charge of Karnataka and Goa, now also took charge of Telangana
 sutron kii maane to digvijay se jab andhra or telugana se ek rajya chunane ko poocha gaya to digvijay ne khud telugana chhodane kii baat kahi
 Digvijay, popularly known as Diggi Raja himself, said that after the Partition, the condition of the party in Andhra Pradesh is very poor, so he will stand in charge of the party and stand there
 rajyasabha main nibhaayenge badi bhoomikahaalanki digvijay kaa rajyasabha saansad kaa kaarykaal 2020 tak he, lekin taaja faisle se tay ho gaya he ki varshon sanghathan main badi bhoomika nibhaane vaale digvijay ab utani badi bhoomika nahin nibhaayenge
 Now he will be more active in Rajya Sabha

 Manisha Kulshrestha is a great creator, 'undeclared representative of half the world'
 haalanki vah 'aadhi duniya kii aghoshit pratinidhi' vaale mere mat ko na maanengi
 She would say, the storyteller is representative of his time
 vah apane likhe main apane vakt kaa itihaas paros rahaa hota he
 The narrator's imagination, his sensation and experience are influenced by his surroundings, and the word skill gives him the form of poetry, story, novel
 isamen pratinidhitiv kii baat kahaan se aati he?ho saktaa he, manisha kulshreshth sach kah rahi hon, or vah jo kah rahi hon, us par tark kii gunjaaish na ho
 But even if we do not go into the detail of his compositions and only see the titles of his printed books, whether it is story compilation 'puppets', 'nothing at all romantic', 'dwarf Hoti Parchhai', 'care of Swat Valley' , 'gandharvagatha', 'anama' or novels 'shigaf', 'shalabhanjika', 'panchkanya' and now 'mallika'
 
 i also do not prove completely wrong
 janvari 6, 2002 ko 'kya aaj bhi?' sheershak se likhi manisha kulshreshth kii kavita kii shuruaati panktiyaan hain-kya ped-paudhonjangalo-jharnontalabon-jalapankhiyonkheto-sarsonkaa arthtumhaare liye aaj bhi hamujhase miltaa julata he?yahaan ek sawaal he, aas he, ummid he, bina kisi nishkarsh ke
 The specialty of Manisha's composition is that she does not reach any conclusion on her part and leaves the decision to the readers
 apane taaja upanyaas 'mallika' main bhi unhone yahi kiya he
 This novel is being discussed everywhere
 par ek tatasth pathak ne mujhe kaha tha, chaahe kuch bhi kaho, manisha kulshreshth kaa yah upanyaas he to behad umdaa, par ise padho to bhaaratendu harishchandra kii ek alag hi chhavi ubhartee he
 While Mallika's stature is quite large and scholarly, Bharatendu looks like a legend
 
 
 baharhaal manisha kulshreshth ne apane kahanikar banane kii prakriya ko samayik prakaashan se do khandon main prakashit katha sankalan 'rang rup ras gandh' kii bhoomika main bahut spashtataa se likh diya he
 Read and understand that journey of a girl full of curiosity to become a storyteller

 As Kisago Maa used to say, 'the dark night of Janmashtami, the river between pali-ghanrao was in spate, the rain had not stopped for three days

 Frankly, this was the time when writing became the last refuge, the habitation of the desolate places, Kumbhigram, where the chaibagans all around, the jungle, the place where the desert starts, then cross the border

 Initially, most of the narrators, poets, do not get out of themselves
 main bhi shuruaati kahaniyon main yahi kar rahi thi
 It was soon realized that it is an easy exercise to make yourself innocent in the story by making various kinds of attractive colors
 yahi vajah he ki apane pehle kahani sangrah kii kahaniyon ko aaj kaa meraa antas sweekaar nahin karata, lekin mujhe lagata he ki ve mere vikaas ke aarmabhik sopan the
 There was no challenge, the real challenge is to sit inside and write
 khaas taur par duusare gender yaa bilkul duusare tabake yaa duusare samaaj ke vyakti ke bheetar ghuskar likhnaa
 Gafuria, Sugna Dholan, Kurjaan Dakan, the orphan of 'weed', the vagabond Goan girl, she gives me joy ever since she did this
 in chunautiyon ko jeene kaa vishuddh anand hi mujhase likhvata he
 Of course, writing this kind of physique is like a solo flight of a small ship, in which your inner reader acts like a navigator
 main lekhak kisi bhi houn, mujhe pataa he- main ek shandaar pathak rahi hum
 So the challenge of this solo flight always fills me with enthusiasm
 haalanki main jab lekhan kii duniya main aayi thi, tab mere paas apni susanskrit bhashaa to thi, kuch alag kism kaa anubhav sansar bhi tha magar darshan, itihaas or raajnneeti, vaicharikta or samskruti ke athaah samandaron main gote maine nahin lagaaye the, lekin main yah jaanati thi ki anubhav chota yaa bada nahin hota, uski abhivyakti or kalaatmakataa choti-badi hoti he, kyonki ek ore 13 varsh kii choti-si zindagi ek tahkhaane main guzarkar, diary likhakar, en frank amar ho gayi, duusari ore darshan, itihaas or samskruti ke athaah samandaron main gote laga kar lambi umr jiye kai lekhak uske jitani prasiddhi na paa sake
 As i said earlier, my gross experiences were all the same, but the subtle experiences have been very deep and confusing
 ‘kahani se tatasth rahane kii’ bado kii naseehat ke baavjood kahani hameshaa mere vajood par chadhakar bolti he, kahani mujhamen hadein paar kar jaati he
 i have started believing in Maya Angelou's saying- "there is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you
" "jab main kahaniyon kii ek acchhee samaj vaali pathak rahi thi, tab bhi acchhee kahani mujh par pret kii tarah dolati thi, sote-jaagate, uthte-baithte
 Now, even as a writer, i am not able to stop the story from dominating itself, as the story of the protagonist of the story at the end of Kurjan writes in the note before his death, 'by bringing back the memory of the things of the past roughly It is easy to see and talk, but weaving a fine story on a doctor is like invoking the stray spirit of the past on your body
 main bahut post, magar mukt mahasoos kar rahaa hum
 'from this experience, i have finally come to know that the writer has no choice but to go through every story while writing, whether it is written on the experience of others or is self-contained
 phir chaahe vah kahani acchhee sabit ho yaa buree 
 While writing the story, i did not set up any laboratory for the use of story and craft, did not resort to test tubes, ready-made chemical blends, spirit lamps, but still the story precipitated in me with complete solidity and sensitivity after a long process
 It has been prescripted
 haalanki hindi sahitya kii chaatra rahane kii vajah se kahani ke siddhanth, kathyaatmak, shilpagat prayog, vibhinn dharaaen, vimarsh mere liye ajanabi kabhi nahin the, magar meri nirbharta in vimarshon, siddhanton par kam hi rahi
 i learned this within the story world that they become dead with more and more use of words
 kahani kaa khud kaa dam to ghutane lagata hi he, kirdaaron ko taaji hawa kii darkaar mahasoos hone lagati he
 What's the Story ? Just a few dialogues, some guilt, some voices or actions or actions
 lekhak kii hazaron nazaron se dekhi gayi, yah nayi-si lagati kahani kii duniya, vahi tumhaari apni puraani duniya he! meri samaj se, jis kahani ko mahasoos karne or likhane main lekhak kii paanch indriyaan kam padati hon or us kahani ko mahasoos karne ke liye pathak kii bhi paanchon anubhutiyaan kaam aa jaaen, balki use do-chaar anubhutiyaan or jagaani pad jaaen to vahi sachhee kahani he
 Story writing is a pleasant feeling of creation, but both the pain and the pleasure go from being the story of the story to the birth of the story
 katha lekhan ke dauraan maine chetanaatmak str par mahila hone ke naate apane lekhan main vahi simaaen mahasoos kin, jo ek aadhunik mahila samaaj main mahasoos karti he
 She is modern, independent, but feminine by nature
 stri hone par use garv he
 She can be a rebel, but cannot go against her nature
 apni prakruti ke viruddh to purush bhi nahin ja saktaa
 i may or may not have understood the exact meaning of my freedom, but i have lived it
 maine apane astitv kii swatantraaa ko harasambhav bachaane kii koshish kii he
 Spontaneously or by fighting, snatching and luring i have kept its door in my hand
 vichaaron kii abhivyakti kii, pahanaave kii, khan-paan kii yaa apane aalas or kaamchori kii azaadi bhi
 Freedom of stubbornness to not allow marriage to become 'order'
 isliye jab-jab maine kahani kii sahaj ravaanagi main bahakar apane bheetar kii vidrohinee strivadi lekhika ko kinare bitha diya he, tab-tab meri kahani ke ant par prashn uthe
 Although this is the culmination of one-sided extremism, it is my own complication of the creation process, which is what it is, the stubbornness of presenting it
 yahi prashn sanjeev or maitreyi pushpaji ne meri kahani ‘kathputliyaan’ ke ant par uthaaya tha ki aakhir hone hi kyon di gayi agnipariksha ? usase vidroh kyon nahin karavaaya gaya
 i could have done this, but the story would have been artificial
 sugana vidroh karti, magar kiske khilaaf ? pati ke khilaaf, jo use duusare ke garbh ke saath apnaane ko taiyaar he, yaa us premi ke saath bhaag jaati, jo swayan vivaahit he ? saare paatr paristhitiyon ke dhaage main uljhe hai, isliye kathputliyaan hai, lekin kya kisi samasya ko hu-ba-hu saamne rakh dena, samaadhaan kii disha nahin sujhata ? mudde uthaakar kahaniyaan likhnaa, meraa uddeshy nahin rahaa
 What i have is frozen as thought, melted as emotion, seeped as experience, only that i can return to the art of creation
 phir usamen sarprize ke taur par koi prachlit mudda ho yaa ghisa-pita vimarsh ho to ho, na ho to kuch nayaa hi sahi
 i write dreams falling asleep in conflicts and conflicts between dreams
 pathak kii upasthiti se bari hona ek abhyaas ke baad aayaa mujhe
 Like every writer, i also wanted that my writing should have a signature style, by reading the first paragraph, people would know that it is 'I', but it is not possible with the endlessness of experiences
 jivan ne yayavari main bhar-bhar jhola anubhav die, des-pardes kii bhashaaon ke tukade die
 The question of composition is often asked to the authors
 sach pucho to is prakriya ko lekar kehane ko kisi kahanikar ke paas kuch nahin hota
 Except for posing and strange habits, yes, but the author can 'see' and save the dense external and internal experience of the sight in the word
 anubhav or rachaav ke bich ek paardarshee taral diwaar jarur honi chahie
 Many times the experience is not able to be three-dimensional in its own way, some or many pieces have to be added to it, many times the experience is stuck between so many fibers and strands that it has to be disassembled by pinup in the 'discovery Tray'
 nisandeh anubhav ko kriti main badalanaa kala he
 It is art to capture reality with the finer foreseep of imagination
 usamen antas kii kaundh pirona kala he
 Art was not 100% pure in my life from the beginning
 main lok-kalaon ke zyada nikat rahi
 When i get inside my mind, i find a curious girl, who is growing up among folk arts like puppet games, polymorphisms, bhavai dances etc
, is shrouded in the shadow of history - forts, steps, where architecture and The outstanding form of sculpture is involved in sports and games
 aees-pais khel rahe hai haweliyon main- baavadiyon main utar rahe hai
 Meera Mahotsav is happening, Devi Lal Samar is coming, child camps for making puppets are being organized in Lokkala Mandal, where not only hand puppets are to be made, we have to write our script, we have to display it
 apane samay ko pakadaney kii zid main to har lekhak rahata hi he, lekin mujhe lagata he aap kisi beete, chal rahe yaa aane vaale samay ke kisi bhi pal ko pakaden to us samay kii triayamita main pakaden or eemaandaaree baraten
 It is not a difficult task to capture the physical reality of our time, but it is more difficult to get caught up in the story of self-control, self-determination, self-determination, contradiction of a person living in that time
 global gaanv kii bheed main, soshal media ke abhaasi doston kii bheed main akele padate jate, zamin, prakruti, rishton se katate jate vyakti kaa santras, upabhoktavaad se aghaaye, ubakaai lete logon kii nakli paryaavarniya chintaaon kaa chittha aaj kii kahani ke ahm vishay ho sakate hai
 The writing of the consciousness that awakens the dying
 beete dinon mujhe lagata rahaa he bhashaa apana swaroop kho rahi he, lekin vidwajan kehete hai- vah viksit ho rahi he
 In this development, as we have destroyed many plants and animals, i feel the same fear for words - that is why my efforts to maintain the Hindi grammatical purity of the language continue, even if my language is called archaic
 kathy se vichaar kii ore janaa ek sachche kathakaar kaa vikaas or vivashtaa donon hi he, jaise raseele fal kaa sanshlisht beej main badalanaa
 While writing, i have seen my dear writers getting rougher and narrower, in such a situation, the author has taken this danger by limiting the number of his readers
 krishna baldev vaid, nirmal verma, mohan rakesh, priyanvad
 For me this is the ideal extreme of writing
 kai lekhakon ko kathy kii rochakata se chipke rahane kii majaburi main bhi chukte dekha he
 Even if Katharas is extinct - i think there is a genotype of the narrative trends coming in synthesis, which in time comes decorated with new Pallavas and flowers
 zindagi kaa moh, azaadi kaa swaad, jivan or manolok ko lekar anwarat jigyaasaaon ke uttar dhundhane kaa paagalpan, eemaandaar abhivyakti kaa saahas jab tak mujhamen shesh he, main marm or manovigyaan kii saghan tahon vaala jivan likhuungi
 a strong revision within itself will last a lifetime
 is katha yatra main mujh eklavya ko kitne-kitne dronacharya mili, un sabakaa atmik aabhaar
 How can i be despised by expressing my gratitude to my parents
 donon gazab ke kissago- hamako bhi kahani main jeene ke ajab-gajab jeevanamoolya de gayi- apni pyaari betiyon- kanupriya- avani kaa shukriya to banataa he
 Shsh, mom is writing a story
 ’ kahkar bachapan main to apane bhole-bhole praytn kiye hi, mujhe vyavdhaan na dene ke, bade hokar bhi mujhe salaah di, meri kalakaarana sanakon main saath diya
 Most gratitude to the Humsafar, who enjoyed growing up fighting - who always showed faith in the immense pneumatic 'my creative energy' and gave me my palms to stand up and eased to fly! Finally thanks to Maheshji , Who proposed printing fifty stories on his fiftieth birthday years ago

 It should be so in India
 ab baat aati he riform kii
 For that the government should take concrete initiative
 lau justise ke aade nahin aana chahie
 i believe that the judge should imprison such criminals, if not hanged, so that they die in jail
 rape or murder ke jaghanya maamalon main na mili umr kii chhot: gul panagajuvenil justise care and protection act 2001 is soch ke saath bana tha ki naaballigon ke paas sahi faisla lene or bhavishya kaa sochane kii puri kshamta nahin hoti

 Three years later, he came out of jail and went to the victim's family and said, i am back and now i will do the same with your second daughter
 ab aap bataaie kanoon ne kitna sudhaar diya us ladke ko
 There is a concept in the US, Legislative Weber
 jisamen rape murder jaise aparaadh main agar apradhi kii niyat sthapit ho chuki he to sajaa dete vakt uski umr kaa khyaal nahin kiya jaataa
 a criminal should never feel that he will commit a crime and come out due to age and his record will also be impeccable
 phir sahmati se sex kii umr 16 kyon he: nishtha gautamanaaballig aparaadhon main se 60 fisadi 16 se 18 ke age group ne kiya he
 Add another figure to it

 But when someone rapes, there is a rule of 18 for him
 ye kahaan kaa nyaay he
 Today we stand here because Jyoti, a brave girl, endured this hideous crime and gave a statement before dying

 What will happen then lau ko criminal or victim ke hisaab se dekhnaa hoga, gender ke hisaab se nahin
 on women in our society 
 unke liye kadam uthaae jane chahie
 But i am against the rattle of reservation
 masalaa ye he ki hamen duusare darje kaa naagarik na samajha jaae

 However, the party also said, "the government should expose Pakistan's lies
" '' It may be noted that Pakistan claimed that India has presented the fact of cross-border firing on the Line of Control (loc) in Jammu and Kashmir as a surgical strike
 iske maddenjar bijepi ne aarope lagaate hue kaha ki sanjay nirupam jaise netaa pramaan mangakar pakistan ke daawey ko hawa dene kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 However, amid growing criticism, Sanjay Nirupam gave a clarification saying, "I am not saying that you release all the video footage

 Sanjay Nirupam has challenged the claim of the government and the army at a time when the BJP had earlier attacked Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal and senior Congress leader and former finance minister p Chidambaram by the Indian Army against Pakistan

 In view of this, BJP alleged that leaders like Sanjay Nirupam are working to air Pakistan's claim by seeking proof
 haalanki badhati aalochanaon ke bich sanjay nirupam ne spashtikaran dete hue kaha, ''main yah nahin kah rahaa hum ki aap sabhi video footage jari karo
 i never think so
 
 
 kyonki ho saktaa he ki ye rashtriya hit main na bhi ho
 
 
 But some evidence needs to be presented
 ''tippaniyan It is worth mentioning that the Army has said that late last Wednesday, India had taken a surgical strike and targeted seven terrorist launch camps
 haalanki sutron ne yah bataane se inkaar kar diya tha ki pioke main kiye gaye is strike main kitne aatanki maare gaye the lekin iske prabhaav par santosh jaahir kiya tha
 It was also said that photographs and videos of the operation were also taken with the help of the drone
 sanjay nirupam ne aise samay main sarkaar or sena ke daawey ko chunauti di he jab isse pehle bijepi ne dilli ke mukhyamantri tathaa aam aadmi party ke pramukh arvind kejariwal or congress ke varisht netaa va purv vittamantri pi chindbaram par pakistan ke khilaaf bhartiya sena dwaara kiye gaye sargical strike par sawaal uthaane ke liye hamalaa bolaa he

 Before the Lok Sabha election results, exit poll survey predicts a big upsurge in Karnataka, although there is time for the results to come, but there has been a political upheaval there
 ab congress-janata dal (secular) kii gathbandhan sarkaar ke astitv par hi sankat mandaraane laga he
 Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy's visit to Delhi has been postponed amid changing political equation
 matdaan ke dauraan iviem main gadabadi ke mudde par aaj (mangalvaar) 22 vipakshi dalon ke netaa chunaav ayog ke saath baithak karne vaale hai, jisamen shaamil hone karnataka ke mukhyamantri or janata dal (es) ke netaa echdi kumaraswami dilli aane vaale the, lekin ab wo dilli nahin aa rahe hai or rajya ke halaat par najar banaae rakhane ke liye bangaloru main ruuk gaye hai
 The rebellion of many angry leaders of the ruling parties is being feared
 abhi congress ke muslim netaa roshan beg ne bagawati tevar dikhaane shuru kar die hai
 Chief Minister Kumaraswamy at 5:30 pm today Congress General Secretary and Congress in-charge of Karnataka
 si venugopal se milane vaale hai
 Political movement in the state has intensified again after the exit poll survey
 ajtak-exis maai india agsit pole ke aankado ke mutabik rajya main bijepi ko 28 siton main se 21 se lekar 25 siten mil sakati hai, jabaki congress or janata dal (es) gathbandhan ke khate main mahaj 3-6 seat aane kii ummid jataai gai he
 This situation is where last year a joint government of Congress and Janata Dal (S) came into existence
 survey ke anusaar bijepi ko rajya main kareeb 49 fisadi vot mil sakate hai jabaki congress-janata dal (es) gathbandhan ko 43 fisadi vot paane kii ummid jataai gai he
 After the survey, changing the tone of Muslim leader of Congress in the state Roshan Baig, the party general secretary KC Venugopal was called the Joker
 unhone congress ke sthaneey netaaon par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki venugopal joker hai
 Dinesh Gundu Rao Nakam is the party president
 unhone aage kaha ki bijepi agar rajya main 18 yaa usase zyada seat paati he to yah siddharmaiya or anya netaaon ke kaaran he
 This is a strong slap for Congress
 unhone apni hi party ke netaa or purv mukhyamantri siddharmaiya kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki vah khud nahin chaahate ki yah sarkaar zyada samay tak chale
 He cannot see Kumaraswamy in the Chief Minister's chair
 karnataka kii raajnneetik paridrishy kii baat kii jaae to 225 siton vaali vidhansabha main bijepi ko 104, congress ko 78, jedies ko 37, basapa ko 1, kepijepi ko 1 or anya ko 2 siton par jeet mili thi
 Neither party got an absolute majority
 bijepi rajya kii sabase badi party hone ke naate pehle bies yediurppa ne mukhyamantri kii shapath lee, lekin congress-jedies ke ek saath aane se vah bahumat sabit nahin kar sake
 After this, Congress formed the HD Kumaraswamy government in the state with the support of Janata Dal (S)
 karnataka main shuruyaat se hi kumaraswami sarkaar par sankat ke badal chhaae hue hai
 Kumaraswamy himself has said this many times
 iske alaava congress ke kai vidhayakon kii naaraazgi kii baaten bhi saamne aati rahi hai
 Not only this, there has also been a lot of talk of differences between veteran Congress leader and former CM Siddaramaiah and Kumaraswamy
 aise main loksabhaa chunaav ke liye karnataka main jis tarah se agsit pole aae hai, us lihaaj se bijepi 2014 se zyada siten jitati hui najar aa rahi he
 If these figures turn into results, then the Kumaraswamy government of Karnataka may face a crisis
 kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon ke baad bijepi karnataka main sarkaar banane kii phir se koshish kar sakati he
 Not only Karnataka but in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress government is in trouble because out of 231 assembly seats in the state, Congress got 113 and BJP 109 seats while BSP managed to win two, SP one and Independent four seats
 is tarah se dekhen to congress or bijepi ke bich mahaj chaar seat kaa fark he
 With Congress having the maximum number of seats, Kamal Nath held power with the support of four independents, two BSP and one SP mlas
 yahaan bhi survey main bijepi badi jeet hasil karti dikh rahi he, aise main yahaan bhi sankat ban saktaa he

 In this accident, both of them died on the spot
 haadase ke baad ghatnasthal par police ke saath-saath siarpief kii team bhi pahunchi
 Police are looking into the cause of the accident
 ghatana ke vistrut byore kii pratiksha he
 a record of every traffic violation will be recorded, this is likely to reduce corruption, police claims, accidents have already happened
 The New Motor Vehicle Act has come into force
 iske baad trephic niyam todane waalon se baari-bharkam jurmaana vasula ja rahaa he
 This has increased people's troubles
 khabaren aisi bhi ai hai jinamein kisi kii selary yaa unki gaadi kii keemat se zyada jurmaana lagaaya gaya he
 Many people also believe that this law is likely to promote corruption as the police will benefit more with such heavy fines
 ise dekhte hue adhikariyon ne javabdehi tay karne kii yojana banaai he
 Now a body camera will be installed on every traffic policeman's pocket to keep records of people who break the rules
 camera record rakhega ki trephic niyamon ke ulanghan ke kis jurm main kitna jurmaana lagaaya gaya he
 Authorities have been directed to apprehend every violation
 bina recording ke koi bhi chaalaan jari nahin kiya jayega
 From breach to printing of invoice everything has to be recorded
 isse police ke paas ulanghan ke saboot to rahenge hi, saat hi yah un logon ke khilaaf police ko shashakt banayega jo kanoon todate samay apane rasookh kaa galat phayda uthaate hai
 This technology has been incorporated to implement the new Motor Vehicle Act
 nae kanoon ke tahat sharaab pikar gaadi chalaane par 10 hajaar rupee jurmaane kaa praavdhaan he jabaki pehle yah raashi 2 hajaar rupye thi
 5 thousand rupees are now being charged for driving dangerously, whereas earlier there was a fine of 1 thousand rupees
 isi ke saath trephic niyamon ke har ulanghan par jurmaane kii raashi pehle kii tulana main kaaphi zyada badha di gai he
 Regarding the new law, Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said, "people have misconceptions
" yadi ve kanoonon kaa paalan karte hai, to koi jurmaana nahin lagaaya jayega
 Legislation has not been enacted to recover the fine
 ise lagu kiya gaya he taaki log yatayaat niyamon ko gambhirtha se len or unka ulanghan na karen
 In response to the impact of the new law, Tughlaq Road traffic inspector Karamveer Singh said, 'this law has made people more aware
 ulanghan or durghatnaayen apekshaakrit kam ho gai hai
 This law will ensure that every commuter complies with the rules
 ham camere kaa prayog isliye kar rahe hai taaki bhrashtachar kii koi gunjaaish na rahe or ulanghan ke saboot bhi hamaare paas rahe
 According to the Motor Vehicles (amendment) Bill 2019 passed from Parliament last month, the punishment has been further hardened
 iskaa pramukh uddeshy logon ke man main kanoon kaa dar paidaa karnaa he, jisase ki yatayaat ulanghan main kami aegi
 If someone is caught driving without a seatbelt, he will be fined Rs 1000, which was earlier only Rs 100
 agar koi gaadi chalaane ke dauraan mobile phone kaa istemaal karte hue pakadaa jaataa he, to use 1000-5000 rupee tak kaa jurmaana dena padegaa, jo ki pehle 1000 rupee tha
 Earlier, a fine of Rs 2000 was imposed on drunk driving, which has now been increased to Rs 10,000
 ek faisle ke anusaar, ambulance or fire brigade jaise apatkaaleen vaahanon ko rasta na dene ke liye driver par 10,000 rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya ja saktaa he

 The charge of the ruling BJP on the Congress Party's slogan of 'garibi Hatao-2' is electoral deception, but is it true that only BJP has the right to electoral deception and promise? garibon, mazdooron, kisaanon aadi ke hiton kii upeksha ke maamle main donon hi partiyaan ek hi thali ke chatte-batte hai
 Mayawati's first reaction is after the Congress's promise to give 72 thousand rupees annually or six thousand rupees a month to the poor of India
 congress ne daawa kiya tha ki agar unki party satta main aati he to is yojana ko lagu kiya jayega
 The plan was announced by Congress President Rahul Gandhi while addressing a rally
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne nunatam aay yojana (nyaay) ko party kii garibi par sargical strike qaraar dete hue mangalvaar ko daawa kiya tha ki ve hindustan se garibi ko khatm kar denge
 Describing the upcoming Lok Sabha election as a battle of two ideologies, he said, 'we decided that if Prime Minister Narendra Modi gives money to the rich, then the Congress party will give money to the poor
 'congress adhyaksh ne kaha tha ki nyaay yojana ke liye congress chah maheene se kaam kar rahi thi or usne iske liye raghuram rajan sahit tamaam bade arthshaastriyon se charchaa kii
 He said that the money in this scheme will go to the account of the woman of the family
 gandhi ne pradhanmantri modi par manaregaa ko khatm karne kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki bharat main nafrat karne vaala harata he or pyaar karne vaala jeetta he
 Addressing the Jansankalp rally in Suratgarh, Rajasthan, Gandhi referred to the party's justice plan and said that if the Congress comes to power, it will ensure that the country's minimum income limit is Rs 12,000
 unhone kaha ki jo bhi parivaar is seemaa se neeche hoga uske khate main congress kii sarkaar 72,000 rupee tak salanaa daalegi
 "proudly tell you that soon after the formation of the Congress Party government in 2019, the minimum income line of India will be Rs
 12,000 per month
" ' Expressing serious concern over the situation in Kashmir, the Congress hoped that Home Minister Rajnath Singh, along with confidence-building measures during his visit to the Valley, would also announce that no 'palette guns' would be used on the protesters
 congress ke varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa or aarope lagaaya ki unhen or unki sarkaar ko kashmir ke logon kii chintaa nahin he, kyonki jab mudde par charchaa ho rahi thi vah na to loksabhaa or na hi rajyasabha main hi maujuud the

 ' aaazaad ne kaha ki kashmir main sthiti 'gambhir chintaa' kaa vishay thi jo hijbul mujahidin aatankwaadi burhan vaani ke maare jane ke baad hui hinsa se prabhavit thi
 Taking a dig at the Prime Minister, he said, 'the Kashmir issue was discussed in the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha, but they did not participate in any of them which shows how much the people of Kashmir and the Prime Minister are concerned
 ' Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and alleged that he and his government were not concerned about the people of Kashmir, because when the issue was being discussed it was neither in the Lok Sabha nor the Rajya Sabha
 Were present
 tippaniyan Azad said, 'now after 16 days, the Home Minister has gone to Kashmir
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki vah kashmir ke logon ke saamne ghoshnaa karenge ki ab se kashmir main pallate gan kaa istemaal nahin kiya jayega
 He said, "I also hope that the Home Minister will initiate confidence-building measures, so that the people of Kashmir once again repose confidence in the central and state governments
" ' Azad said that the situation in Kashmir was a matter of 'grave concern' which was affected by the violence that took place after the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani
 unhone pradhanmantri par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, 'kashmir mudde par rajyasabha or loksabhaa main charchaa hui, lekin unhone unamem se kisi main bhi hissaa nahin liya jo yah dikhaata he ki kashmir ke logon kii sarkaar or pradhanmantri ko kitni chintaa he

 He said that the BJP had only made Modi the head of the election campaign committee and not the prime ministerial candidate
 aise main jediu ne duusari party ke anduruni maamalon par nishkarsh nikaalkar endie se baahar jane ko chunaa
 Rajnath Singh said that all political parties are free to take decisions about themselves

 He advised Nitish, 'you should have an alliance with someone else, but do not tie up with the Congress that is going to sink
 'jediu ke bijepi se naata todne par nitish dwaara bijepi ke mantriyon ko unhen istipha dene kaa mauka die bina ekaek hataae jane ko galat bataate hue unki is karrwai ko ekatarfa bataaya
 Describing Narendra Modi as a symbol of good governance and development, Rajnath Singh said that his achievements are being discussed in the world
 rajnath ne kaha ki bijepi shasit anya pradeshon ke mukhyamantri bhi apane-apane rajyon main behatar kaam kar rahe hai
 In view of his better work, he is confident that with BJP coming to power at the center, the country will be able to come out of the social, economic and political morass
 rajnath singh ne centre kii congressnith upie sarkaar par prahaar karte hue kaha ki congress ne is desh par 54-54 saalon tak hukumat kii he, lekin 120 crores kii aabaadi vaale bharat kii aaj ginati duniya ke garib deshon main hoti he
 He alleged that if any party has done the work of tarnishing the image of India at the international level, then only Congress has done it
 rajnath ne aarope lagaaya ki jab se upie centre main satta main ai he, desh main manhagaai babbti ja rahi he

 He said that during the NDA regime, where the rupee was worth about 45 rupees against the dollar, it has reached 60 rupees today

 Referring to the misrule of the Congress-led UPA government, he said that during the tenure of this government, so many cases of corruption have opened up that it is difficult to remember

 agast 2012 main english team ke captain bane cook ne england ke liye sabase zyaada test match main captaini kii he
 Under Cook's captaincy, England defeated Australia in their Ashes series in 2013 and 2015 at home
 cook kii captaini main england team ne 2012 main bharat or dakshin africa main badi jeet darz kii
 Apart from Tests, Cook has also captained the England team in 69 odis from 2010 to 2014
 tippaniyan On leaving the captaincy, Cook said, 'it was an honor for me to captain the England team for about 5 years
 captaini chhodana mere liye ek mushkil faisalaa rahaa lekin ye mere or team ke liye sahi faisalaa he
 The captain of the ODI also had to leave Cook under pressure, after which Eoin Morgan took charge of the ODI team
 cook kii captaini main bhi pichley kuch samay se english team kaa pradarshan lagaataar girtaa rahaa jisaki vajah se unhen hataane kii maang badhane lagi thi
 It is believed that Root can be given the command of the team in place of Cook, who was the Test captain of England for more than four years
 pichley saal bharat daure par test main mili haar ke baad cook par captaini chhodane kaa dabaav bad gaya or balle se safal rahe root ko captain banane kii maang hone lagi
 In the five-test series against India, England lost by a margin of 0-4
 root english test itihaas ke 80wein captain banate hai to unke saamne sabase badi chunauti eshez series hogi jo isi saal november main shuru hogi
 Cook spoke to England and Wales Cricket Board Chairman Colin Graves before resigning and expressed his desire to continue playing as a player
 32 saal ke cook opening ballebaaz hai or unke naam par 140 test main 11 hazaar se zyaada ran hai
 Cook has also been a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 2012 and has the distinction of becoming ICC World Test captain in 2013 and 2015, 2016
 cook ne captaini chhodane par kaha, 'qareeb 5 saal tak england team kii captaini karnaa mere liye sammaan kii baat rahi
 It was a difficult decision for me to give up the captaincy but it is the right decision for me and the team
 ' vanade kii captaini bhi cook ko dabaav main chhodani padi thi jiske baad eon morgan ne vanade team kii kaman sanbhali
 Under the captaincy of Cook too, the performance of the English team has been falling continuously for some time, due to which the demand for his removal started increasing
 mana ja rahaa he ki chaar saal se zyaada samay tak england ke test captain rahe cook kii jagah jo root ko team kii kaman di ja sakati he
 After the Test loss to India last year, pressure on Cook to leave the captaincy increased and there was a demand to make Root, who was successful with the bat, as captain
 bharat ke khilaaf paanch test kii siries main england ko 0-4 ke antar se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 If Root becomes the 80th captain in English Test history, the biggest challenge before him will be the Ashes series, which will start in November this year
 cook ne istifa dene se pehle england or wales cricket board ke chairman colin greves (colin Graves) se baat karne kii or ek khilaadi ke taur par khelte rahane kii ichha jataai
 Cook, 32, is the opening batsman and has more than 11 thousand runs in 140 Tests to his name
 cook 2012 main vijden cricketer of da year bhi rah chuke hai or 2013 or 2015, 2016 main isisi world test captain banane kaa gaurav bhi hasil kar chuke hai
 Cook spoke to England and Wales Cricket Board Chairman Colin Graves before resigning and expressed his desire to continue playing as a player
 32 saal ke cook opening ballebaaz hai or unke naam par 140 test main 11 hazaar se zyaada ran hai

 jaise hi yah saaf ho gaya ki abaki baar modi sarkaar banane vaali he, vaise hi desh ke bhavi pradhanmantri narendra modi apni maa kaa aashirwad lene gandhinagar pahunche
 Although Modi does not forget to take his mother's blessings before starting any small or big work, but this time the thing is a bit different
 ji haa, narendra modi pradhanmantri pad kii gaddi par baithne se thik pehle apni maa kaa aashirwad lene vaale pehle bhartiya ban gaye hai
 Not only this, after taking the oath on 25th May, he will become the Prime Minister seeking the blessings of his mother
 darasal, isse pehle jitne bhi logon ne bharat ke pradhanmantri pad kii shapath lee, us vakt unamem se kisi kii bhi maa jinda nahin thi
 India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was sworn in as Prime Minister at 8:30 am on August 15, 1947, while his mother Swaroopani Thussu died nine years earlier in 1938
 isi tarah duusare pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri kii maa ramdulari kaa nidhan bhi unke shapath lene se bahut pehle ho gaya tha
 Photo: Indira Gandhi, the third and first female Prime Minister of India, took oath in 1966 when Modi visited his mother, but his mother Kamala Nehru died on 28 February 1936
 isi tarah morarji desai, charan singh, rajeev gandhi, veepi singh, chandra shekhar, pivi narsimha raav, atal bihari vaajapeyi, echdi deveguda, aaike gujral or manmohan singh bhi pradhanmantri banane ke baad apni maa kaa aashirwad nahin le paae
 However, Narendra Modi is among the lucky people who have their mother's hand on their head
 janata dal united ke adhyaksh or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne congress se saaf shabdon main kah diya he ki ve kisi ke pichhalggu nahin hai
 Addressing the members of the state executive in Patna on Sunday, Nitish Kumar said that there should be no misunderstanding that they are behind anyone
 ve sahyogi hai or sahyogi kii tarah rahenge
 Nitish Kumar told the Congress leaders in clear terms that coaxing is not a part of his nature
 nitish in dinon congress se khafa chal rahe hai
 Particularly Nitish's displeasure is with Congress General Secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad's statement that Nitish is not an ideology but a leader of many ideology streams
 aaazaad kaa yah bayaan raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar diya gaya tha
 On the presidential election issue, Nitish made it clear that he supported Ramnath Kovind, who was the Governor of Bihar, not the Bharatiya Janata Party
 is mudde par nitish ne congress party ke netaaon ke bayaan par kaha ki bhidana chahie kisase or bhid gaye kisase! On compromising with principles, Nitish explained to his party leaders that they do not compromise on principles
 congress par sidhaa hamalaa karte hue nitish ne kaha ki siddhant par aap badalte rahete hai
 Late Ram Manohar Lohia used to say that Congress are official Gandhians
 raashtrapati chunaav kii charchaa karte hue nitish ne kaha ki dilli main sonia gandhi dwaara bulaai gai baithak ke pehle gulam nabi aaazaad ke patna main bayaan ki kovind kaa virodh kiya jayega, ke baad us baithak main jane kaa koi auchity nahin rah gaya tha
 Nitish also accused the Congress party that after independence, he first ignored the principles of Gandhi and later Nehru
 tippaniyan On the future of the grand alliance in Bihar, he asked his party leaders to focus on the party's work
 nitish ne kaha ki gathbandhan kaise chal rahaa he, jo hona he vah hoga or ham sahi samay par nirnay lete hai
 But we don't care about anyone
 lekin nitish ne apane sahyogi dwaara yojit raily se sambandhit atakalon par yah kahkar viraam laga diya ki nimantran aane par ve jarur jaaenge
 It is clear from Nitish's attitude that at the moment, under the guise of compulsion to run the government, he is not ready to bow to any issue in front of his colleague
 nitish ne vipaksh kii ekta kii charchaa karte hue kaha ki pehle assam chunaav ke purv or duusari baar uttar pradesh chunaav se pehle unhone pahal kii, lekin congress ke netaaon ne nahin hone diya or donon jagah bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar bani
 Nitish's tight stand will surely increase the closeness between his two allies Congress and RJD in the coming days
 jaanakar maanate hai ki congress ke baar-baar yah jataane se ki unhone lalu yadav ke dabaav ke baavjood nitish kumaar ko bihar main mahagathbandhan kaa netaa banaaya, nitish na keval dukhi hai balki is baat se chidhe bhi hai ki jab bhi ve bijepi ko maat dene ke liye koi thos ranneeti kii pahal karte hai, congress ke netaa hi usko vifal kar dete hai
 He also does not secretly plant in public and in the media that Nitish is making relations with BJP
 nitish kumaar ne congress ke netaaon se saaf shabdon main kaha ki khushaamad karnaa unki fitrat main shaamil nahin he
 Nitish is upset with Congress these days
 khaskar nitish kii naaraazgi congress ke mahasachiv gulam nabi aaazaad ke us bayaan ko lekar he ki nitish ek vichaardhaara nahin, balki kai vichaar dhara ke netaa hai
 Azad's statement was made about the presidential election
 raashtrapati chunaav ke mudde par nitish ne saaf kiya ki unhone ramnath kovind, jo ki bihar ke rajyapal the, ko samarthan diya he na ki bhartiya janata party ko
 On this issue, Nitish said on the statement of the leaders of the Congress party that whom should he confront and whom he clashed with! siddhanton se samjhaute par nitish ne apni party ke netaaon ko vistaar se bataaya ki ve siddhanton se samjhauta nahin karte
 Attacking Congress directly, Nitish said that on principle you keep changing
 swargeey raamamanohar lohia kaha karte the ki congress sarkari gandhivadi hai
 Referring to the presidential election, Nitish said that before the meeting convened by Sonia Gandhi in Delhi, Ghulam Nabi Azad's statement in Patna that Kovind would be opposed, there was no justification to go to that meeting
 nitish ne congress party par yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki aazaadee ke baad sabase pehle unhone gandhi or baad main nehru ke siddhanton ko tilanjali di
 The comments bihar main mahagathbandhan ke bhavishya par unhone apni party ke netaaon se party ke kaam par dhyaan dene ke liye kaha
 Nitish said that how the alliance is going, what is to happen will happen and we decide at the right time
 lekin ham kisi kii parvaah nahin karte hai
 But Nitish put an end to the speculation related to the rally organized by his colleague, saying that he would definitely leave if the invitation came
 nitish ke tevar se spasht he ki philhal sarkaar chalaane kii majaburi kii aad main ve apane kisi sahyogi ke saamne kisi mudde par jhukne ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 Referring to the unity of the opposition, Nitish said that he took the initiative before the first Assam elections and the second time before the Uttar Pradesh elections, but the Congress leaders did not let it happen and the Bharatiya Janata Party government was formed at both places
 nitish ke kade stand se nishchit rup se aane vaale dinon main unke do sahyogiyon congress or rajd ke bich najdiki badhegi
 Knowing that the Congress has repeatedly expressed that he made Nitish Kumar the leader of the Grand Alliance in Bihar, despite pressure from Lalu Yadav, Nitish is not only sad but also irritated that whenever he defeats the BJP To initiate a concrete strategy, only the Congress leaders thwart it
 ve saarvajanik rup se or media main chupake se yah bhi plant karne se nahin chookte ki nitish bijepi se sambandh madhur bana rahe hai
 Nitish is upset with Congress these days

 Union Finance Minister and senior Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee said that the leaders of the society agitating for the Lokpal Bill have given such signs as if they have become mps
 mukherjee ne kaha, jis tarah is desh main samaaj andolan chal rahaa he, yah sanket de rahaa he ki jaise uske netaa saansad ban gaye hon
 Addressing the convocation of Bengal Engineering and Science University at Shivpur in Howrah district, the Finance Minister said that during an event in Hanoi, he was asked why the Indian government was giving so much importance to the social movement in the country
 mukherjee ne kaha, maine unase kaha ki bhartiya loktantr gatiheen nahin he
 It is a multilateral democracy
 hamen vibhinn logon or sanghathanon ke vichaaron par gaur karnaa he
 This is a new kind of process
 hamen unhen sunanaa he
 The Finance Minister said that there are thousands of views on any important issue, which will have to be heard
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf apane anshan se centre sarkaar ko hilaa dene vaale anna hajaare ne buudhvaar ko khud ke raajnneeti main utarane yaa apane andolan ko raajnneetik mode dene kii sambhaavnaaon se inkaar kar diya
 Hazare (74) said absolutely not
 main bhrashtachar virdohi andolan ko raajnneeti se mukt rakhane ke liye puri aihtiyaat barat rahaa hum
 He was answering the question whether his agitation for the Jan Lokpal Bill is gradually taking a political turn after Team Anna's announcement that people should not vote for the anti-jan Lokpal Bill mps in the next parliamentary election
 haalanki varisht bhaajapa netaa laal krishna adwani kii bhrashtachar virdohi prastaavit rathyatra par hajaare ne khulkar kuch nahin kaha
 Hazare said if this journey is for the overthrow of corruption then why don't they oppose the ruling party and bring the Jan Lokpal Bill? He said if he is honest in his fight against corruption, then why don't he establish Lokayukta in BJP ruled states? We suspect political motive in this journey
 congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi ke is bayaan par ki lokapal ko chunaav ayog kii tarj par sanvaidhanik darja milanaa chahie hajaare ne kaha lokapal or chunaav ayukta donon ke paas unke kaary main sarkari hastkshep ke bina swytt darja hoga
 Hazare completely rejected Congress leader Digvijay Singh's allegation that his anti-corruption movement was based on the support of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
 unhone vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) netaa ashok singhl ke is daawey ko bhi khaarij kiya ki unke sanghathan ne hajaare ke andolan kaa samarthan kiya tha
 The Gandhian social worker said that our movement has nothing to do with RSS or VHP
 aisa logon ko bhramit karne ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 On Ramdev's anti-corruption campaign, Hazare said that he had no doubt about the yoga guru's commitment in uprooting corruption from public life
 hajaare ne kaha unke (ramdev) manch par ek thappe vaale log baithe
 Our support to them is limited to the anti-corruption aspect only
 ham unka manch saajha nahin karenge or vah hamaara manch saajha nahin karenge
 We will support each other in different ways to fight corruption
 yah puche jane par ki kya vah apane andolan par sansad ke jawaab se santusht hai unhone kaha ki ham tab tak santusht nahin honge jab tak ki lokapal vidheyak kanoon nahin ban jaataa
 Hazare said that he agreed to the deadline to pass the bill in the winter session of Parliament because of the government's written promise
 unhone kaha kyonki yah likhit vaayada tha isliye maine isamen vishwaas jataayaa
 Asked how he accepted the intervention of Union Minister Vilas Rao Deshmukh to end his fast, while he is facing charges in the Adarsh scam, Hazare said, "I did not welcome him as Vilas Rao Deshmukh in Ramlila Maidan
" did
 hajaare ne kaha unhone unhen aamantrit nahin kiya tha
 i only accepted the Prime Minister's letter which he handed over to me as an envoy to Manmohan Singh
 yah puche jane par ki kya unke anshan ke dauraan sarkaar se baat karne vaali team ko unki manjuuri thi hajaare ne iskaa jawaab haa main diya
 Hazare did not say much about the bouquet sent by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, wishing him speedy recovery in the hospital after his 12-day fast
 unhone kaha aspataal main mujhe jo guladasta mila vah prakriyaagat taur par pradhanmantri karyaalay dwaara bheja gaya tha
 The Gandhian was asked what he would do if there were differences among his team members
 Hazare replied that there were neither differences in ghosts between us nor will there be in future
 daraar tab padati he jab log swaarthee or laalchee hote hai
 All the members of my team are fighting the battle selflessly
 kiran bedi dwaara saansadon kaa majaak banaae jane ke mudde par hajaare ne kaha unhone ramlila maidan main saansadon kaa majaak uda kar sirf apni bhavanaaen jaahir kii thim
 Some mps behave inappropriately
 visheshadhikaar ulanghan kaa notice milane par vah iskaa jawaab dengi

 Smith says, 'greg used to say that i am very beautiful, and he will take me into the modeling world
 usne mujhajhe pyaar kaa bhi izhaar kiya'
 There was talk on the phone between the two for about two weeks

 Greg made her realize that he would take care of her age and would never leave her alone

 'kai dinon tak main yahi maanati thi ki jo hua vah meri hi galati thi
 But now i don't think so '

 supreme court ke purv nyaayadhish markandeya katju ne amitabh bachchan ke liye likhaa he ki - unka dimag khaali he
 On this post written on Facebook, Katju wrote for Bachchan that 'amitabh Bachchan is a person whose mind is empty and because most media people praise him, i think all of them are also empty
 ' After getting a lot of responses to this post, Katju in the next post made it clear why he wrote this for Bachchan
 katju likhte hai 'jab maine likhaa ki amitabh bachchan ke dimag main kuch nahin he, to kai logon ne mujhase kaha ki main apni baat zaraa vistaar main likhuun
 Karl Marx had said that religion is an opium for the public, which is often used by the king as a drug to keep his mass community calm, so that people do not resist
 lekin bhartiya janata ko shant rakhane ke liye sirf ek drug kaaphi nahin he, unhen kai tarah ke nashe kii jarurat hoti he
 Religion is one of them
 duusare tarah ke nashe jaise filmein, media, cricket, jyotish, baba, vagairah vagairah
 In order to pacify the public, our rulers serve all these drugs in the same way as different medicines are given to cure a disease
 aisa hi ek tagada nasha filmon kaa bhi he
 The Roman rulers used to say, 'if you cannot give bread to the public, then give them a circus
 ' to hamaari zyaadaatar filmein kisi sarkas se kam nahin hai jo hamaare shaasha logon ko isliye paroste hai kyonki vah unhen roti to de nahin sakate (jaise rojgaar, swasthya sevaayen, acha khaanaa, acchhee padhai, vagairah) Amitabh Bachchan's films, like those of Dev Anand, Shammi Kapoor, Rajesh Khanna, have an addiction, they take people into a fictional world and so to keep the public calm all these people are very useful to our rulers
 Huh
 tippaniyan Apart from being a good actor, what else is there in Amitabh Bachchan? Do they have any scientific suggestions to solve the big problems of the country? Is not
 samay-samay par vah media channelon par sandesh dete dikh jate hai or vakt-vakt par unhen bhala kaam karte hue dekha ja saktaa he, lekin phir jab ye sab karne ke liye aapako acchhee khaasi rakam mili to yah koun nahin karnaa chahega?' Like every time, this post of Katju also became a matter of debate

 The same group, supporting Katju, wrote that a 'great' actor like Bachchan should not advance himself to fulfill the political objectives of a politician

 The talk started with slogans during the speech, but once Netaji started reprimanding, then one by one, all the big leaders of the party, including the leaders, from ministers to ministers, took different classes one by one
 'netaji' ne saaf kaha ki party main anushaasan or padhane-likhane vaale kaaryakartaaon-netaaon kii jabardast kami he or zyaadaatar log imaanadaaree se kaam karne ke bajaae chapalusee kar aage badhanaa chaahate hai
 Not only this, the SP supremo said with the claim that the great leaders and ministers of the party have fallen into ashes these days and most of them have not even read the party's constitution and election manifesto
 mulaayam singh ne party kii nai paudh bane noujvaan netaaon se apil kii ki khud ko anushaasit rakhen kyonki aane vaale daur main chunaav jeet kar samaajawaadee party kaa varchasv banaae rakhana unke liye badi chunauti he
 Mulayam Singh also lashed out at the recommended style of ministers and leaders in the party office, explaining to the activists with love or rebuke
 kaha galati karne vaale apane khasmkhas afasar kii posting karwaane ke liye netaa akasar unke eemaandaar hone kaa tark dete hai jabaki eemaandaar hona adhikariyon kii naukari par bane rahane ke liye pehali shart he
 How Mulayam became strict on his leaders- i have explained many times that slogans are not raised during the speech
 par phir bhi koi maanata nahin
 i have never seen so much indiscipline
 maine akhilesh se bataaya jab hamane pehali sarkaar banaai thi tab kaise log the mere saath
 Now there is a group of sycophants here
 kitne logon ko nikaaloge yahaan
 Akhilesh will be happy by raising slogans, so let me tell, my happiness is more important than Akhilesh's happiness
 - aapke saamne dobaaraa sarkaar banane kii badi chunauti he
 If you do not form the government again, you will be very difficult
 - main daawa karata hum ki hamaari party ke ministaron tak ko samvidhan nahin pataa he or party kaa chunavi ghoshnaa patr bhi
 While it is only 23 pages
 - kisaan or gaanv ke rahane waalon ko sab pataa he aap kya kar rahe ho
 i was told that things are going great but keep a check on your boys
 jaisaa man aata he vaisaa karte hai, pakshpaat karte hai, adhikariyon se ladate hai
 Tell, the officer will be fought
 adhikari agar galat karata he to uski shikaayat kariye
 - Never recommending an officer
 kai sifarish aati hai ki sahab galati ho gai eemaandaar adhikari he waapas bhej dijiye
 So the officer has to be honest
 koi ehsaan kar diya kya agar eemaandaar he
 Shockingly, extravagance is the most debilitating issue
 shauk bahut bad gaya he aaj kal
 But your party is different
 aap lohiavaadi ho

 mandir main 'padiksu' (sikaa vitaran) kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha, jisamen badi taadaad main shraddhaluon ne hissaa liya
 It is being told that during this period when the priest started distributing coins, there was a sudden uproar here and people started falling on top of each other while taking the coins
 bhagdad main kai shraddhalu bheed ke neeche bhi dab gaye jisase 7 logon kii maut ho gai or kai jakhmi ho gaye
 Smartphones with two, three and four cameras have come in the market and now if you get to see a smartphone with 16 cameras then there is no need to be in a hurry
 korean company alji ne ek patent file kiya he jisamen 16 lens vaala smartphone kaa concept he
 According to a report by Let's Go Digital, LG has filed a patent for a smartphone with 16 lenses
 is heksa lens concept main karvd seoup hoga 16 lens mil kar alag alag drushtikon se photography kii ja sakegi
 According to this patent, the mirror and flash will be kept separately with the Hexa lens camera in the rear of the smartphone
 isse subject ko raushnee milegi or rier camera se hi selfi clic kii jaaegi or isaki vajah mirar hoga
 That is, instead of the front, the selfie can also be clicked with the rear camera
 aisi technology flip smartfones main dekhne ko miltaa he
 According to the patent, its major advantage will be that there will be many click photos from multiple angles at once and changes can be made after clicking
 udhaaharan ke taur par kisi shaks kii photo clic karke baad main uskaa sar ko rotate kar sakate hai
 You can use the angle that will be the best
 patent ke matlab ye nahin he ki 16 camere vaala smartphone aa hi jayega
 Research development will be done on this and then the company can launch it
 kai baar patent ke baad concept scrap kar diya jaataa he
 So the 16 camera smartphone is not sure to come
 company ne philhal iske bare main koi statment jari nahin kiya he
 The incidents of mob lynching in the past in many parts of the country have put everyone in worry
 jharkhand main tabrej ansaari ko ‘jai shri ram’ kaa naaraa nahin lagane kii vajah se bheed ne peet-peet kar maar diya tha
 Now this issue has reached the United Nations
 jahaan ek enjio ne is mudde ke bare main bataaya
 The Modi government has been besieged by AIMIM chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi on the issue
 ovaisi ne likhaa ki sanghiyon ne aise karname kiye hai, jinaki charchaa aaj sanyukt raashtra main bhi ho rahi he
 Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi wrote on Twitter on Thursday, 'well done, Sanghi mob lynchers, you have hurt India's honor due to your inhuman reasons, which is also being mentioned in the United Nations
 scotland ke jaj ne bilkul thik kaha he ye samvidhan kii linching he
 'well done Sanghi Mob Lynchers you have brought disrepute to Bharat by your inhumane actions, which is being mentioned in UNHRC, rightly said by a Sctt Judge it is Lynching of constitutionpm Modi wants 5 Trillion ECONOMY when Hate is being institutionalized? Https: / / t
 co / net5999z7l— Asaduddin Owaisi (@asadowaisi)july 4, 2019asaduddin ovaisi ne modi sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhta hue likhaa ki modi sarkaar desh kii iconomi ko 5 trillian dollar tak pahunchaana chaahati he, wo bhi tab jab nafrat ko sanvaidhanik rup diya ja rahaa he
 Let me tell you that the video that Asaduddin Owaisi has shared is referring to the Jharkhand mob lynching on the platform of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC)
 video main NGO ke dwaara kaha gaya he ki tabrej ansaari ko jharkhand main hindu bheed ne jai shri ram ke naare naa lagane kii vajah se maar diya gaya, iske alaava ek muslim teacher ko bhi peeta gaya
 The NGO said in its statement that Pratap Sarangi of the ruling party said in the Parliament House that people who cannot raise Hindu slogans should remain in the country
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle desh main bhi in muddon ko lekar vivaad ho chukaa he
 The opposition in Parliament also targeted the government on this issue
 itnaa hi nahin, pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi apane bayaan main iskaa zikr kiya tha
 PM Modi said that these types of things will not be accepted in the country
 narendra modi kii aguwai main ek baar phir endie kii sarkaar prachand bahumat ke saath banane ko taiyaar he
 Till 3 pm, the NDA 350 has touched the trend
 narendra modi ko ek baar phir satta ke shikhar tak pahunchane main uttar bharat kaa ahm role rahaa
 From the plains of himachal-uttarakhand to the plains of Uttar Pradesh, from the eastern air of Bihar to the soil of Rajasthan
 har jagah bhagava-bhagava ho gaya
 On the basis of these states, Narendra Modi's 300+ mission was completed
 uttar bharat kii kareeb 200 siton main se bijepi or unke saathiyon ke khate main 170 siten gayi
 The alliance failed in UP, Modi's tsunami became the biggest railways in Uttar Pradesh, BJP had created history by bringing 71+ seats last time
 amit shah kaa daawa tha ki is baar party 74+ jaaegi, lekin saamne sapa-basapa kaa gathbandhan tha
 Now when the trends are in front, BJP has managed to bring 59 seats + one Apna Dal i
e
 60 seats in UP
 to vahiin sapa-basapa kaa gathbandhan milakar bhi 20 kaa aankada paar nahin kar paaya or 18 par simat gaya
 Here, a storm called Modi, such that Rahul Gandhi's seat in Amethi is also seen in danger
 kaam ai pahaado kii javaniutar bharat ke pahari kshetra yani uttarakhand or himachal pradesh main ek baar phir modi naam kaa jaadu chalaa
 All four seats of Himachal Pradesh are seen going to the bjp's account, here nearly 70 percent of the vote went to the BJP
 to vahiin uttarakhand kii 5 siton par bhi bijepi kii jeet hui he
 That is, saffron flag has been waved in 9 seats in both the states
 dilli ke dil main modi!‘saaton siten modi ko’ isi naare ke dam par bijepi ne dilli main hunkaar bhari
 congress-aap alliance did not happen and BJP benefited from this
 dilli main bijepi ne is baar gautam gambhir, hansraj hans, manoj tiwari jaise diggajon ko utaara tha
 56 percent of the vote in Delhi has gone to the BJP account
 rajasthan-madhya pradesh-chhattisgarhuttar bharat ke jin teen rajyon main congress ko karishme kaa intjaar tha, vahaan par uske saath khel ho gaya
 The BJP alliance has got all the 25 seats in Rajasthan, 28 out of 29 seats in Madhya Pradesh and 8 out of 11 in Chhattisgarh
 chunaav se pehle vidhansabha chunaav main jeet hasil kar congress ke hausale buland the, lekin congress kaa jaadu yahaan nahin chal sakaa
 Bihar is out! In Bihar, where five parties were engaged together to stop BJP-JDU-LJP, they were completely eliminated
 rajya kii 40 loksabhaa siton main se bijepi-jediu ke gathbandhan main 38 siten apane naam kii hai, jabaki mahagathbandhan sirf 2 siton par hi simat kar rah gaya
 The RJD was constantly practicing the caste equation, but everything failed in front of the Modi magic

 jiladhikari is maamle main jimmedaar hai or unhone mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko sahi sthiti ke bare main nahin bataaya
 He advocated the abolition of the public service system in the country, saying that Britain had given this system to India, but now it has also rejected it
 america, japan tathaa khadi deshon main bhi yah vyavastha nahin he
 The Minority Welfare Minister went a step ahead of the statement of SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav of running the state without IAS officers and said that the number of such officers will be in a few thousand, whereas the country is of 125 crore people
 kya baaki log desh nahin chalaa sakenge

 bisisiai ne ipel se pune varirs kaa anubandh radd kar diya kyonki sahaara ke swaamitv vaali yah frenchiji bhugtan karne main naakaam rahi or usne agle satr ke liye bank guarantee dene se bhi inkaar kar diya
 a top BCCI official said that the decision was taken during a meeting of the powerful working committee of the Cricket Board here
 pune varirs or bisisiai ke bich takaraav kii sthiti thi kyonki board ne frenchiji fees kaa bhugtan nahin karne par bank guarantee bhunaa lee thi
 Sahara Group then announced its withdrawal from the IPL
 usne haalanki bisisiai kaa aadhikarik rup se jaankaree nahin di
 BCCI thereafter 170 from Sahara to remain part of the league next year
 2 karod rupee kii bank guarantee maangi thi
 The BCCI subsequently reminded Sahara several times for payment and then eventually canceled his IPL contract
 ravivaar kii baithak main ipel sanchaalan parishad ke sadsy bhi maujuud the jahaan board ne pune varirs ko 30 din kaa anubandh radd karne kaa notice jari kiya
 Sahara sought to complete the arbitration process related to franchise fees
 sahaara kaa maananaa tha ki frenchiji fees kam honi chahie kyonki bisisiai ne team ko utane ipel match muhaiyaa nahin karaae jitne maichon kaa usne vaada kiya tha
 The mediation process has not started yet due to differences between BCCI and Sahara over the appointment of judges
 sahaara ne pune team ko 2010 main lagbhag 37 karod dollar (lagbhag 1702 karod rupee) main kharida tha
 It was the most expensive franchise of the IPL and the cancellation of its contract would result in huge losses to the BCCI

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi was announcing the departure of the institution from the ramparts of the Red Fort, which since 20 years after its birth became the cause of the confusion of the Finance Commissions and the concern of the State Governments, because it was not in economic planning but central resources
 There was proficiency in political bandits
 yah bantwaaraa shiksha, swasthya, rojgaar, garibi unmoolan par kendrit vibhinn naam rup vaali dasiyon kendriya yojanaon kii oot main hota rahaa he
 Today's MNREGA, education campaign, health mission etc
 are the new heirs of this tradition
 panchavarshiya yojanaon ne kabhi apekshit nattejey nahin die
 The cherished goals of poverty alleviation and balanced development were always deceiving and the monitoring of the implementation of central schemes remained on paper, hence the need for guidance of the Planning Commission was also eliminated as soon as the license permit Raj departed
 yojana ayog ko band karne kii naubat isaki asafalataaon ke kaaran nahin balki isaki vivaadit ‘safalataa’ ke kaaran ai he
 The constitutional right to decide the system of sharing the central resources among the states (article 280) is only with the Finance Commission which does this every fifth year
 lekin 1950 main bane yojana ayog ne kendriya sansaadhan baantne ke ek samvidhanetar, samanaantar model ko safalataa ke saath sthapit kar diya jo vitt ayog kii bhoomika ko simit karata tha or centre pryojit yojanaon ke jariye rajnatik paimaanon par, rajyon ke bich sansaadhan baantta tha
 This is the reason why, with the collapse of this six-decade framework of Congress economic planning, the states have silent consents with the Modi government
 yojana ayog kii vyavastha par pehali aapatti mahavir tyaagi kii adhyakshata vaale paanchaven (1969) vitt ayog ne darj karai
 In 1973, the Sixth Finance Commission, headed by k Brahmanand Reddy (former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh), underlined this discrepancy and by the beginning of the seventies, the Chief Ministers began to openly question the centrality of the central schemes
 yojana ayog ke sadsy bi
 K
 chaturvedi samiti kii report (2011) pramaan he ki pichley chah dashakon main lagbhag prayek congressi or gaiyr-congressi mukhyamantri ne is skim raaj kaa virodh kiya he
 The reason for this is that the Planning Commission distributes the help from the Union Government to the states every year through the schemes
 is bantwaare kaa koi paardarshee paimaana nahin he
 Allotment can be spent only under the objective set under the central scheme, so the independence of the state governments in the expenditure on the development of their state has been decreasing from year to year while the number of central schemes has steadily increased to 360 in the Ninth Five Year Plan
 
 11veen yojana main har saal lagbhag kareeb ek lakh karod ru
 These plans were distributed
 arthshaastri va 13wein vitt ayog kii sadsy indira rajaraman kaa shodh bataata he ki 1950 se lekar 2007 tak 55 varshon main rajyon main satta parivartan ke aadhaar par yojana aavanton kam yaa zyada hote rahe hai
 In the states, the Planning Commission can be held responsible for schemes such as free laptops, bicycles, blankets, saris or unemployment allowances, as centrally sponsored schemes are out of the state's budget and control and its political advantages lie in the power of the center
 See you at the party
 isliye rajyon ne apni yojanaayen garh leen or ek pratispardhi loklubhaavan skim raaj shuru ho gaya
 This model of sending the plan from the Center to the villages was also against the use of Panchayati Raj, so the Congress governments strangled their own idea of giving independence to the Panchayats
 yojana ayog jaisi vyavastha ko khatm karne ke liye congress kii aitihaasik haar jaruri thi
 It was only after the first major electoral defeat of the Congress in the 1967 assembly elections that the Gadgil Mookerjee formula (1969) was made to distribute central aid among the states
 alabatta yojana ayog ko band karne ke taaja vimarsh main kendriya skim raaj ko khatm karne kii charchaa nadaarad he
 If Narendra Modi is using his experience as the Chief Minister, then he knows that in the market economy, there is no need for an alternative to the Planning Commission because the government and private research institutes and advisory councils are already there to advise the government
 Are present
 yojana ayog ko band karne kaa matlab, darasal dambh or apaardarshita se bhare kendriya skim raaj kii samaapti he, jo vikaas ke faislon main rajyon kii aazaadee kaa apharan karata he
 If not, the Planning Commission will only be renamed and this parallel center of economic power will be reduced to the hands of a handful of new people

 The media is once again targeting Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan
 unki shikaayat he ki media ne unhen niraash kiya he or unka isse pun: mohabhang hua he
 According to the blog via blogbig's blog, the reason for this disillusionment is with a journalist
 unki shikaayat he ki ek pratishthit angreji dainik ke is patrkaar ne bina bataae unke intervyuu ko gupt camere se record kiya or phir use prasaarit kar diya
 Amitabh has written in his blog that on the occasion of his 40 years in the film world, the introduction of Bigg Boss 3 and his birthday, a journalist from an English daily asked him for an interview
 pehle to amitabh ne usase email se sawaal jawaab karne ko kaha, lekin baar baar aagrah kiye jane par vah samay dene ko taiyaar ho gaye
 This was an interview in Big B's office at the time of incest with the use of an incognito camera, and then as Amitabh says, it was published after a brief reshuffle
 samasya iske baad hui, jab amitabh ko maaloom hua ki unki jaankaree ke bina unke intervyuu ko gupt camere main record kiya gaya or uskaa prasaaran us akhbaar ke net sanskaran main hua
 Affected by prejudice In the newspaper blog, Amitabh has alleged that this newspaper has been preoccupied with the news related to him and his family in the past
 unhone likhaa he ki agar vah patrkaar unase video intervyuu ke liye kahata to bhi vah haragij manaa nahin karte, lekin uski is harakat se unka media se ek baar phir mohabhang ho gaya he
 The bjp's victory in the Karnataka elections has once again made it clear that even after four years, the Modi wave has not subsided
 narendra modi kii lahar bijepi ko 2014 main kendra kii satta saunpane ke baad bhi kaayam he
 BJP is going to hold power in 21 states out of 29 states of the country i
e
 the 21st state Karnataka is also going to BJP
 ek baar phir modi lahar ne kamaal dikhaaya he or nateeja congress ko apana sabase majboot kila (karnataka) dhahate hue dekhnaa pad rahaa he
 The Congress has got this defeat in all six political zones of Karnataka, out of which at least three are called Congress strongholds
 mangalvaar dopaher tak voton kii ginati or rujhaanon se saaf he ki rajya main bijepi kii sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 The BJP is leading in victory in about 121 seats and the Congress is facing defeat in almost half of the seats in the last assembly elections
 bijepi kokarnatakake sabhi jone yani old mysore, costal-karnataka, bengalooru-karnataka, mumbai-karnataka, central karnataka or hyderabad-karnataka main shandaar jeet mili, to duusari ore congress in jone main kharaab pradarshan ke saath-saath costal karnataka, central-karnataka, hyderabad-karnataka or old mysore ke apane garh ko ganvaana padaa
 Why Modi wave is important for this victory of BJP? Siddaramaiah-led Congress government was in power in Karnataka
