 Although the condition of Delhi is not as bad as in Chennai, ground water is getting depleted in many areas due to illegal borewells
 agle saal tak kuch ilaake main iskaa behad kharaab asar hone vaala he
 Due to lack of water, Delhi is not getting as much water as it needs
 1140 million galens prati din pani chahie magar mil rahaa he 936 million galens prati din
 Even though we are removing the water crisis in Delhi from underground water, it is going to bring a big crisis
 pichley saal dilli jal board ne mana tha ki yahaan 5000 se adhik point hai jahaan avaidh tareeke se pani nikaala jaataa he
 Some of these have also been banned
 dilli ke paas abhi bhi pani bachaane ke kai maukey hai agar isi tarah ram bharose chalaa to sankat gaharaa ho jayega
 The Government of Delhi has formulated a policy to revive 201 reservoirs
 kabhi rajdhani dilli main 300 se adhik talab hua karte the
 By the way, in the areas where Delhi has a large population, people were drinking and drinking water like this in the month of April
 pani ke pipe kaa pressure kam hota he to logon ne naalee se neeche ek gaddha jaisaa bana rakhaa he jisamen pani bharta he or phir vahaan se pani nikaal kar bartan main rakhte hai
 In the days of rain, the drain water gets filled in this pit
 pani kaa yah sankat tivi par nahin dikhataa to ham maan lete hai ki dilli main pani kaa sankat nahin he
 At present, no one is aware of how many submersible pumps are being installed in India
 vishwa bank kii report ke anusaar bharat duniya main sabase adhik bhumigat jal nikaalane vaala desh he
 Every year India extracts 25 percent of the ground water in the world
 yani dhai lakh karod litre pani nikaal letaa he zamin se
 Even the corporations of the government are extracting water from the land, water is also being sold illegally
 gaanvon main yah dhandha tezi se failaa he
 One news of 2018 was received from the Times of India
 ludhiana nagar nigam survey kar rahaa tha ki kitne sabmarsible bagaiyr license or fees ke chal rahe hai to pataa chalaa ki 4000 se adhik sabmarsible bina kisi license ke chal rahe hai
 Submersible has been banned in the city since 2010
 adaalat ke aadesh se yah bain laga tha
 If you put it up, the corporation's 23-member committee considers and allows
 zaahir he yah prakriya isliye sakht kii gai he taaki pani barbaad na ho
 But even then more than 4000 submersibles were running illegally
 isse pataa chalata he ki hamaara shahari samaaj mauka mili to na to niyam kii parvaah karata he or na hi pani kaa
 Now come to Bihar
 hamaare sahyogi pramod gupta ne aaj sabmarsible pump kii in tasveeron ko aap tak pahunchane ke liye bahut mehnat kii he
 Pramod was today Laxmi Sagar of Darbhanga, Jackfowl Mohalla and Splash
 unhone dekha ki aath jagahon par sabmarsible pump lagane kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 Somewhere a submersible is being installed from a machine, then somewhere from a hand machine i
e
 the old way
 agar yah ek din kaa ausat he to aap anumaan laga sakate hai ki darbhanga shahar or uske aas-paas hi pichley teen maheenon main 2 se 3 hazaar sabmarsible pump lagaae ja chuke honge
 People are installing submersible pumps on their behalf
 iske liye ve 75000 se ek lakh tak kharch bhi kar rahe hai
 Not only this, the government is also installing about 150 submersible pumps in the wards here so that water can be delivered to the homes of the people
 in mashiinon ko dekhakar aap santosh kar sakate hai ki kuch saal ke liye pani kaa intazaam to ho gaya magar bhumigat jal kaa dohan karenge to yah ghatata he
 In many states, it has been observed that more people use water from the ground than the ground water recharged due to flood or rain
 raajnneetik rup se yah faisla bhale sahi ho magar sabmarsible bihar ke liye yaa puure bharat ke liye nayaa sankat khadaa kar rahaa he
 To tell you one more thing, it takes 30 to 40 thousand liters of water to install a submersible pump
 sabmarsible pump ko lagaataar pani chahie hota he
 Where does this water come from? zaahir he avaidh rup se aata hoga
 Where water is left, it will come from there
 darbhanga main to 250 feet par pani aa ja rahaa he lekin bihar ke kai jagahon par pani teen sau feet ke neeche chalaa gaya he
 Water has gone down 300 feet in Muzaffarpur, Patna, Vaishali
 bihar bhar ke nigamon kaa hisaab to nahin he lekin gramin vaardon kii sankhya sava lakh ke kareeb he
 Submersible will be installed in all 1
25 lakh panchayati wards
 agle saal tak bihar kii zamin main lakhon sabmarsible lag chuke honge
 This palatoo pond is next to the locality in which the submersible seemed
 yah talab jalkumbhi se bharaa he magar neeche pani bachaa he
 The pipes which are seen through it are drawn and put in a submersible pump machine so that it can drain the water
 agar aap yahi hisaab laga len ki bihar main kitne hazaar pump lag rahe hai or har pump ke liye chalis hazaar litre pani kahaan se aa rahaa he to dar jaaenge
 But do not worry
 jab tak whatsap main gudmorning bhejne kii suvidha he tab tak aapako kuch nahin hoga
 Do not get upset seeing the report, but thank you that you are having fun in the midst of this dreadful crisis
 talab pine or chaur ko bachaana hi hoga
 People have to tell that if you have installed submersible pumps then you do not become the owner of water
 pani kaa istamaal hisaab se hi karnaa hoga
 Otherwise, work is going on today, tomorrow will not work
 bihar kii janata kaa hi hissaa he jisane talabon par kabza kar ghar bana rahe hai
 Everyone expects from the government whether people can be expected to tell themselves that they have built a house by taking possession of the pond
 nahin
 Then this crisis will never go away
 yah darambhaga kaa haraahi talab he
 It is still left but a large part of it has been captured
 sochie 1000 feet chaudaai isaki
 But it has occupied far east and south
 yahi haal anya talabon kaa bhi he
 If you show 500 programs to the violators on the water crisis, they will laugh
 unhen pataa he ki program karne se kabza nahin hatataa he
 Not only them, we also know this
 barish yaa baadh ke baad bhumigat jal ri charge ho jaataa he lekin jis raftaar se ham bhumigat jal kaa istemaal kar rahe hai us raftaar se pani richarge nahin hota he
 We are using more water than we recharge
 policy research studies piares ne 2016 main ek report taiyaar kii thi jo central ground board kii report ke aadhaar par he
 According to this arsenic is found in groundwater in 10 states, which causes cancer, diabetes, heart disease, etc
 20-100 meter ke level par pani main miltaa he
 Are we cleaning this water and giving it to the people
 jab niti ayog kii report kahati he ki 70 pratishat pani pradooshit he
 Now even the government believes that two lakh people die in India every year from polluted water
 har din 500 se adhik maut hoti he
 The Modi government has created the Ministry of Water Power this time
 iske mantri hai gajendra singh shekhavat
 On June 9, he said in the press conference that there are many states where clean water i
e
 drinking water is less than 5 percent
 bihar isamen ek he
 Drinking water in Bihar is only 5 percent
 madhya pradesh kaa agar malwa
 Where you see the colony being built, there is actually a pond under it
 kuch hi saal pehle logon ne yahaan talab dekha tha
 This pond was not far from the district headquarters
 atikaraman karne vaale vaigyanikon ne is talab ko gaayab hi kar diya
 When it fills during the rainy days, the water level of the surrounding areas would rise
 ab talab ke naam par chota sa gaddha bachaa he jisamen naaliyon kaa ganda pani jamaa hota he
 When our colleague Zafar Multani searched government documents, it was found that this pond is on one hectare area in the records
 prashasan ko kahaan to atikaraman hataanaa tha, ulta usne yahaan raste banawaye, pani kii pipe line lagaai, bijli ke pole lagaae
 Many houses are also built here under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
 lekin kisi ne record room jaakar nahin dekha ki yahaan jo talab tha vah kahaan gaya
 Many times people say that make people aware on the problem of water, then we have made you aware, now tell me whether the collector can remove the encroachment of this pond
 lambii gahari saans lete rahiye
 Today is also Yoga Day
 umrao bai is talab kii kahani bataa rahi hai
 The pond is over
 use bharkar logon ne ghar bana liye hai
 Now the same people are getting water from private tankers
 300 rupee ek tanker ke de rahe hai
 The municipality supplies water here once in three days
 ab aap bataaen
 To whom will you explain? sarkaar ko, prashasan ko yaa logon ko
 People are buying water by filling the pond
 main yah sab isliye bataa rahaa hum ki ab chahenge to bhi kuch nahin hoga
 The NITI Aayog will also say, the Prime Minister will also say, the experts of water will also say, but can the people who have filled the ponds from the people to the governments come back now
 pani sankat kaa yahi samaadhaan he ki uskaa tivi kawarej ho saktaa he
 One day TV coverage will make you bored
 raajnneetik dal chunaav jeetne ke liye tanker free kar denge lekin tanker bhi ek din suukh jaaenge
 Now see the name of this place is the frying of the bus stand
 talai kaa matlab talab hi to hota he
 Till 6 years ago people used to see the pond here
 ab yahaan atikaraman ho chukaa he
 Shopping complex has been created
 kisi ne nahin sochaa ki barish kaa pani aisi hi jagahon par to jamaa hota he
 Goes inside the land which is useful for the city itself
 lekin pani kii jagah par shahar basegaa to pani kahaan se aayega
 Media coverage will not bring water
 sarkaar ne niyam banaae hai ki jalaashyon ko nasht nahin kiya ja saktaa he ab sarkaar hi kya apane niyam uthaakar in nirmaan ko tod sakati he
 If he is serious about saving water, then one should remove such government and private encroachments
 sarkaar ke dastavej main yah jagah talab he
 So the government should take its place
 tab aap yakeen kiijie ki koi sarkaar pani ke sankat ko dur karne ke liye gambhir he
 Those who feel that there is a lack of awareness about water, just write a water crisis on the Internet
 hazaron lekh milenge
 Read it and become aware
 phir bataaen ki jaagruk hone ke baad ve kya karnaa chaahate hai
 Can their awareness bring back the ponds buried under the encroachment? nahin laa sakati he
 Remember that 550 people die every day in India by drinking polluted water and two lakh people die in a year
 jafar multani kii report kaa yah hissaa dekhie
 This is the night pond
 iske kinare par majaar bhi he, mandir bhi he
 This pond was spread over 48 bighas
 ek hazaar saal pehle bana tha
 The population was less then but how big the pond was built
 ab aabaadi ne talab hi kha liya he
 This pond of 48 bighas has shrunk
 yahaan se atikaraman to hataaya gaya he lekin saalon tak iske pani main naale kaa pani miltaa rahaa
 Due to this, its water has become unusable
 log pani se nikalne vaali badboo hi bardaasht nahin kar pate
 Therefore it is a lie that this crisis is due to lack of awareness
 darasal jin logon ne talabon par kabza kiya wo kaaphi jaagruk log hi the
 He knew that in the coming time man will live through whatsapp, there will be no need of water, so he filled the idle ponds and built houses
 in panktiyon ko samajhane ke liye do baar program dekhiegaa

 Excerpts from his conversation with India Today Associate Editor Asit Jolly: There is a growing perception that you are divided into several camps — one faction is loyal to Kejriwal, some towards you and comparatively less outspoken members like Prashant Bhushan
 Many people want you to disappear from the land of India
 is laalasaa kii vajah se hi media main party kii aisi chhavi bani he
 There is no party in the world that does not have different views and in which people do not try to make internal adjustments so that they can agree with each other
 aap jaisi party main isaki ummid or bhi kii ja sakati he kyonki isamen vibhinn vaicharik prishthbhumi or anubhavon ke log hai
 Shazia Ilmi went out first
 ab aapane chitthee likh kejariwal ke netritv par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Is it not rational for Kejriwal to remain as AAP convenor? It is clear from my letter that i am not questioning Arvind's leadership
 maine sahakarmiyon ko us pravriti ke bare main chetaya he jo is desh main or hamaari rajnatik samskruti main he
 We individuals start worshiping, which has a natural tendency to reduce political power to personal power
 maine buniyadi siddhanton ke bare main kuch sawaal uthaae the
 Most of the issues were discussed in the national executive meeting
 shajia ilmi ne isi tarah ke masale uthaae the, lekin tab koi karrwai nahin hui?maine party kii ore se shajia ko jawaab diya tha
 The party officially acknowledged that their concerns were legitimate and legitimate
 hamane unase kaha tha ki ve party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak tak intjaar karen taaki unki chintaaon par samuhik rup se vichaar kiya ja sake
 The Executive has unanimously passed a resolution requesting them to return
 kya in sabase kaaryakartaaon or walantier main bhram kii sthiti nahin paidaa hui?yah sambhav he ki chunaav ke kuch din baad tak hamaare walantirs ko party netritv se saaf sanket na mil paae hon
 This would have affected their morale
 rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main party ke aage badaae ke liye ek saaf khaakaa taiyaar kiya gaya
 All the negative things got settled
 party chhodie vaale netaa shajia ilmi, ashvini upaadhyaay or captain gopinath alag gut banane kii taiyaari main hai
 i do not think Shazia will be part of this group
 ashvini upaadhyaay aap main kisi jilastareey kaaryakari samiti kaa hissaa bhi nahin rahe hai
 He himself announced to join the party, criticized himself and decided to quit
 matbhedon ke saamne aane se aap ko milane vaale chande kii raftaar ghati he
 Is the supporter base confused? i don't know if this is the right thing

 In UP, is the Congress supporting the Grand Alliance not just in the Grand Alliance
 ye sawaal aaj isliye uth gaya kyonki congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne daawa kiya he ki unki party ne aise ummidavaar hi khadey kiye hai, jo yaa to jeet rahe hai yaa phir bijepi ko haraa rahe hai
 After this statement of Priyanka Gandhi, BJP declared Congress as a vote-cut party
 priyanka gandhi ke is bayaan ke baad or bhi kai logon ke bayaan aae
 Former Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh said that 'congress leader (priyanka) is saying that we are helping her (alliance)
 iskaa matlab he begaani shaadi main abdulla divaana
 Amar Singh also said that 'I respect Priyanka ji a lot
 maine unke kai bhaashan sune hai
 She protests politically and has openly stated that the Congress is contesting to cut the bjp's vote
 ve khule taur par maan chuki hai ki ye chunaav congress jeetne ke liye nahin balki kisi ek dal ko haraane ke liye lard rahi he
 This is not positive politics but i am a strong supporter of his candor
 ajtak par ek charchaa ke dauraan jab amar singh se poocha gaya ki kya congress votakatwa kii bhoomika nibhaa rahi he to unhone kaha, 'raajnneeti main yah pehali baar nahin ho rahaa he, pehle bhi uttar pradesh main ek baar samaajawaadee party sabase bade dal ke rup main ubhari thi
 Then to stop him, the BJP gave Mayawati, the smallest party, the chief minister's post
 uskaa nateeja ye hua ki aaj mayawati ji ubhar kar ke bijepi ko hi nuksaan pahunchaa rahi hai
 Amar Singh said, "anyone doing negative politics whether the BJP has done in the past or the Congress is doing in the present, does not have good results
" matlab ye he ki boyaa ped babul kaa aam kahaan se hoy
 Noorbano was replaced by a Hindu candidate in Rampur so that there would be a split of Hindu votes which would harm the BJP but the BJP was not harmed
 kyonki chalati hui dhara ke pratikul girane vaale nadi naalon kaa koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 He said that the Congress is fighting not to win this election but to defeat a particular party
 gauratlab he ki india today group kii analysis main bhi saaf hua tha ki 52 main 44 siten aisi hai jin par congress or mahagathbandhan kii ranneeti se bijepi ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, Priyanka Gandhi's statement is very important in which she said that where we are strong we will win but where we are weak, we have only fielded candidates to defeat BJP to defeat BJP
 india today group ke data intelligence unit yani diu ne pehle hi apni analysis main khulaasa kiya tha ki vaaki congress upi main espi-bispi gathbandhan ko madad kar rahi he
 diu analyzed 52 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP
 8 siton par ekadusre ke diggajon ke khilaaf congress or upi ke mahagathbandhan ne ummidavaar nahin khadey kiye hai
 These seats are Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Mainpuri, Firozabad, Azamgarh, Kannauj, Rae Bareli and Amethi
 52 main se baaki 44 siton par diu kii analysis main saamne aayaa he ki congress ne 34 ummidavaar aisi jatiyon ke khadey kiye hai jo bijepi ke paramparaagat voter rahe hai
 Of these, 17 Congress candidates belong to Brahmin, Rajput, Vaishya, Jat or other upper castes
 2014 main in jatiyon main se 70 fisadi se zyada votaron ne bijepi ko vot diya tha
 DIU has found in its analysis that 28 Congress candidates are making it difficult for BJP
 jabaki 16 congress ke ummidavaar mahagathbandhan ke ummidavaaron kii chunauti ban rahe hai
 In all, only 36 of the 52 seats are where the strategy of Congress and Grand Alliance is working against BJP
 haalanki chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bispi adhyaksh mayawati or espi adhyaksh akhilesh ne congress par bhi joardaar hamalaa bolaa he

 supreme court kii fatkaar ke baavjood padmavati par logon kii bayaanbaji thamane kaa naam nahin le rahi
 Attacking Padmavati, Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Pravin Togadia said that if the central government does not ban the film, then what will happen in the cinema house will see history
 praveen togadiya ne naam liye bina guuruuvaar ko bhopal main bijepi netaaon par nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said, Those contestants in Gujarat should tell what they did for Hindutva? Tell him if you want to fight for development
 aaj kisaan, chaatr sab pareshaan hai
 If someone puts a sword on his head, Togadia talks about the heart
 gujarat kii janata 18 disambar ko vikaas kaa jawaab degi
 Togadia said, it is good only if we do not talk about Hindutva which does not build Ram temple and does not settle Hindus in Kashmir
 gujarat main rahul gandhi ke mandir aane ke sawaal par kaha, mandir main aane vaale har kisi kaa swaagat hona chahie
 Padmavati controversy: film tampered with historical facts wrong - Nana Patekarbhansali's appearance before the Parliamentary Committee, on Thursday, Director Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Censor Board President Prasoon Joshi are to appear before Parliament's Information and Technology Committee, where they will present their side Will keep duusari taraf loksabhaa kii petishan cameti ke saamne bhansaali, soochna evam prasaaran mantralay or sensor board padmavati vivaad par apana paksh rakhenge
 There are lectures for Rani Padmini in Delhi University

 is cameti kii adhyakshata anuraag thakur karenge
 Where Bhansali will present his side of the film
 is cameti main paresh rawal or raaj babbar ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 Let me tell you, in the committee meeting held on November 17, it was decided that the people of the industry should be called and talked to consider the challenges related to the film
 padmavati vivaad ke baad jis tarah film industry ke logon ne apni naaraazgi jataai thi
 Seeing this, the chairman of the committee Anurag Thakur decided to first call Director Bhansali first
 chup rahane kii hidaayat de chukaa he supreme courtpichley dinon supreme court ne centre sarkaar ko jamkar khari-khoti sunai thi
 During the hearing of the PIL on the statement of some Chief Ministers, Ministers and public representatives, the question was that how can those in the positions of responsible who have not cleared the film censor board comment on it? The Supreme Court wondered, such discussion among citizens is a different subject, but how can those in responsible positions issue such statements
 ' centre sarkaar ko nirdesh diya ki CBFC kii ore se clearence milane se pehle vah sunishchit kare jimmedaar padon par baithe logon kii taraf se aise bayaan na aae
 The court alleged that because of such statements, an atmosphere was being created against the film
 kyon supreme court ko kerani padi thi aisi tippanee ?darasal, padmavati par jari vivaad ke dauraan kendriya mantriyon, saansadon, kai rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ne vivaadit bayaan die
 Some leaders threatened to cut the head and nose of Padmavati director Sanjay Leela Bhansali and actress Deepika Padukone
 karodon ke inaam kii bhi ghoshnaa kii
 Such statements are believed to have added fuel to the entire case
 amu ne sir ke badale kii thi 10 karod ke inaam kii ghoshnaharyana bijepi chif media ko-ordinator surajpal amu ne dhamkee bhare lahaze main kaha tha, desh kaa rajput samaaj ek-screen jalaane kii takat rakhata he
 He announced a reward of Rs 10 crore in exchange for beheading Padmavati director Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Deepika Padukone who plays Padmavati
 amu ne kaha tha, 'agar ye film relies hui to ham cinemagharon main swatchta abhiyaan chalaayenge
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi must use his power to stop the controversial film
 ' kuch or netaaon ne film se jude logon par tejaab phenkane or haath-pair todane kii dhamkee dene kaa aarope lagaaya
 The MP had made an embarrassing statement, the BJP MP from Ujjain had made a comment
 unhone kaha tha ki jinke gharon main auraton ke kai shuhar hote hai wo bhala johar ke bare main kya janenge
 Union Minister Uma Bharti had said, Alauddin Khilji was barbaric
 uski rani padmavati par buree najar thi
 He was accused of tampering with history in the film
 haalanki unhone deepika ko naak kaatane kii dhamkee dene kii aalochana kii thi
 The statements of these Chief Ministers are also worth noting # 1
 yogi adityanathupi siem yogi ne kaha tha, film ke khilaaf ho rahe virodh-pradarshan or dhamkiyon ke liye bhansaali bhi samaan rup se jimmedaar hai
 He has got used to playing with people's feelings
 unhone kaha, is vivaad main pradarshnakariyon ke saath film nirmaataaon ke khilaaf bhi karrwai honi chahie
 No one has the right to take law into their own hands
 meraa maananaa he ki agar dhamkee dene vaale doshi hai to bhansaali bhi kam doshi nahin hai
 Apart from this, he said, one should avoid giving threats like killing and should respect each other
 # 2
 Vijay Rupani, Gujarat CM CM Rupani had said, the decision has been taken after talks with Kshatriya and other organizations
 tay hua he ki jab tak aapattiyon kaa samaadhaan nahin hoga, kaanoon-vyavastha ko dekhte hue gujarat main film relies nahin kii ja sakati
 This film can spoil the atmosphere
 chunaav ke maddenjar kisi tarah kii pratikraya main hinsa se ashaanti fail sakati he
 The Home Ministry is watching this
 roopaani ne kaha tha, 'main is film ko nahin dekhnaa chahta
 Those whose feelings have been hurt (from the film) came with me with their issues
 chunaav ke baad ham film kii relies ke bare main vichaar karenge
 ' # 3

 Describing Padmavati as the mother of the nation, he said, 'tampering with the historical facts related to Her Majesty Padmavati will not be tolerated
 main spasht kahana chahta hum ki madhyapradesh kii dharti par padmavati film relies nahin hogi
 Not only this, Shivraj also announced the construction of a memorial for Queen Padmavati in the memorial site of Veer Bharat in Bhopal

 Apart from the open opposition of the film by the BJP governments in Captain Amarinder singhteen states, the Congress government of Punjab is also standing against it
 punjab ke siem captain amarinder singh ne film ko lekar rajputon kii aapattiyon kaa samarthan kiya tha
 When will the film come? Prasoon has said that given the current status of the film, it may take 68 days to give a certificate to the film

 Several e-mails surfaced in this case show that Shirke had called the ECB President for this

 The BCCI President Anurag Thakur and Secretary Ajay Shirke were removed by the Supreme Court after they refused to accept these recommendations

 They wanted to persuade him so that England would end the current tour of India

 And right now before the Delhi elections, the Aam Aadmi Party is also looking for the same villain
 pichhali baar jab dilli main chunaav hue the to kejariwal or unki party ko bhrashtachar naam ke villen ne wo hero banane kaa mauka diya jo janata dhundh rahi thi

 The public has already rejected the Congress and in such a situation, the contest is being considered between BJP and AAP
 aam aadmi party kii dikkat ye he ki hero se super hero banane kii koshish main 49 din main istife kaa unka stant buree tarah fel rahaa
 He did not become a superhero but gave the villain to the BJP for these elections, due to which he is trying to convince the public that he is his real primate

 In such a situation, you are now creating a villain
 ab uski koshish trilokapuri ke tanaav ko mudda banaakar bijepi ko villen banane kii he
 But this strategy is going to be good for BJP because if it increases polarization then the poor of Trilokpuri will be easily divided into hindu-muslims
 lekin, is ranneeti main do dikkate hai
 One is that by doing so, it is giving the BJP more opportunity to polarize and secondly that it is giving the sitting opponents a chance to shift focus from the achievements of their 49-day government
 haalanki 49 din banaam 150 din ke kaam kii tulana kaa sawaal khadaa karte hording lagaae gaye hai, lekin kejariwal or unki party ko samajhnaa hoga ki unki ye ranneeti sirf hording tak nahin balki puure chunaav tak logon ke bich bhi pahunchni chahie

 Another worrying news has emerged for the economy in the last phase of Modi government
 april maheene main desh ke sarvice sector main growth saat maheene ke nichle str par pahunch gai he
 The growth of the service sector has declined due to slowing down of new business and disruptions due to elections
 ek antarrashtriya survey main yah jaankaree saamne ai he
 The survey has predicted better economic conditions after the election, which gives a positive outlook for the service sector and will help to boost employment
 nikkei india services bijness activity index (piemai) april main 51 ank par rahaa jo march main 52 ank par tha
 This is the lowest level since September last year
 haalanki, piemai kaa 50 ank se upar rahanaa gatividhiyon main vistaar or 50 ank se neeche se rahanaa gatividhiyon main giravat ko dikhaata he
 Thus there has been an expansion in service activities in April, but it is the lowest level compared to the last seven months, while this is the 11th consecutive month when the service sector has been above 50 points

 It was during the tenure of the Congress that Sabarmesh said that many documents of the revenue department between the years 1954 and 2010 show that this is the property of the Mahal government but, the company of Raje and Lalit Modi, Niyant Heritage Hotels, did not play any role of the state government

 -input bhashaa se In the last 5 years, democracy in Pakistan has weakened further and terrorist attacks in Jammu and Kashmir have increased by 177 percent
 aisa ham isliye kah rahe hai kyonki pichley 5 saal main pakistan ke demokrasi index main das fisadi kii giravat hui he
 To show the world that elections were held in Pakistan and Imran Khan became Prime Minister, but the Democracy Index of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) shows that democracy in Pakistan has become weaker than before
 hamane pichley paanch saal ke pakistan ke demokrasi index (kisi bhi desh main loktantr kii sthiti) kaa milan salanaa aatanki ghatnaon se kiya or paaya ki jab-jab pakistan main loktantr kamjor hua he kashmir main aatanki vaardaat bade hai
 To understand the relationship between weakening democracy and terror, we compared the Democracy Index from 2014 to 2018
 demokrasi index ek suchakank he jo bharat or pakistan sahit duniya ke dedh sau deshon main loktantr kii sthiti ko bataata he
 Each country is numbered from one to ten according to different scales
 kam number vaala kharaab or adhik number paane vaala behatar loktantr mana jaataa he
 4 in Pakistan's Democracy Index 2014 according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)
 64 tha jo 2018 main girakar 4
 17 left
 is dauraan kashmir main hone vaali aatanki ghatnaayen bhi teji se badi he
 According to the Home Ministry, while there were 222 terrorist incidents in Kashmir in 2014, the number of these incidents increased by 177 percent to 614 in 2018
 paanch saal pehle pakistan kaa loktantr global ranking main 108 se phisalkar 112 wein sthaan par aa gaya
 This decline suggests that holding elections only is not democracy
 pakistan kaa loktantr abhi tak faujee afasaron or kathmullon se aaazaad nahin ho paaya he
 This is because they easily pass criticism of blasphemy, blasphemy, and laws restricting women's rights
 fouj or kathmullon kaa gathjod hameshaa kashmir ko target karata rahaa he
 In fact, Pakistan's democracy has always been dominated by a large section of military dictators and religious leaders
 yah bada or taqatvar dhada kashmir ko bhunaane kaa koi mauka nahin chodta chaahe or iske liye wo apane loktantr kii neenv khodne se bhi gurej nahin karte
 Tremendous rigging and corruption are common during elections in Pakistan and this is the biggest reason for the decline in the Democracy Index
 haal ke chunaavon main jahaan imran khan kii pakistan taharik e insaaf party ne sattarudh pakistan muslim lig (navaj) ko shikast di
 This tension escalated after allegations of mass rigging by opposition parties
 pakistan ke purv pradhanmantri navaj sharif kii ummidavaari ko panama paper main naam aane ke baad hue invesitegeshan ke baad supreme court ne nirast kar diya
 Any kind of debate in Pakistan, whether it is religion or violence, always starts with Kashmir

 In this violence, more than six thousand security forces have lost their lives in the last thirty years

 In an interview to India Today on 11 February 2016, former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf clearly stated that the ISI trains lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed
 musharraf ne aage kaha tha ki aatanki hamale tab tak nahin rukenge jab tak bharat kashmir ke ‘mul’ mudde ko nahin sulajhaata
 Kashmir has been associated with the sentiments of Pakistanis
 kashmir main ladane vaala har shaks swatantraaa sainani he”
 Not only Pakistan alone, India is surrounded by many non-democratic or weak democratic countries on many sides, due to which the Indian borders including Kashmir face risks on the coming days
 jab kabhi bharat ne pakistan ko aatanki hamale ke jimmedaar jaish-e-mohammad ke mukhiya masood ajahar ko blaclist karne kii maang uthaai he, china ne sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main vito power kaa istemaal karke in prayaason ko jhatka diya he
 That is, one thing is clear, where democracy will be weak, that country will resort to spreading disturbances in other countries to hide its mistakes and weaknesses, so it is very important that democracy be strengthened
 demokrasi index kya he?iconomist intelligence unit har saal 165 deshon main loktantr kii sthiti par survey report nikaalati he
 The countries are broadly divided into four categories - "full democracy", "flawed democracy", "hybrid regime" and "authoritarian regime"
 ek se das ke bich ke suchakank main 8 se zyada number paane vaala desh full democracy criteria main rakhaa jaataa he
 If a country gets more than 6 and less than 8 indices, then it is kept in "flawed democracy"
 2018 ke demokrasi index main bharat or sanyukt rajya america ko isi category main rakhaa gaya he
 Countries with an index of 6 or less but more than 4 are placed in the hybrid regime
 pakistan kaa loktantr isi category main aata he
 Countries with an index of 4 or less are included in the authoritarian regime

 arabiai ne yah bhi saaf kar diya he ki log saal 2005 se pehle ke note kaa istemaal bejhijak kisi bhi tarah ke len-dein main kar sakate hai

 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath has called the opposition's claim false that the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) notification relating to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the retail sector needs the approval of only one House of Parliament
 vipaksh kaa kahana he ki rajyasabha se manjuuri nahin milane par faisla lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa jahaan upie ke paas bahumat nahin he
 Kamal Nath said, 'it will be passed if passed by a House
 ise donon sadanon se paarit karaane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 This is the rule
 ’makapa netaa seetaram yechuri ne kaha tha ki bahu brands khudara kshetra main 51 pratishat epadiai ko manjuuri die jane sambandhi femaa adhisuchana ko sansad ke donon sadanon se paarit karaayaa janaa jaruri he
 Kamal Nath did not appear to agree with this argument of the opposition
 unhone kaha, ‘kisi bhi cheez ko adaalat le jaaya ja saktaa he
 If that happens, we will deal with it
 ’ mantri ne jor dekar kaha ki loksabhaa or rajyasabha ke liye niyam alag-alag hai
 Kamal Nath, however, admitted that the FEMA notification could be pulled up to the next session which is three months later
 ise bajet satr main paarit kiya ja saktaa he or sarkaar ke paas ise manjuur karaane ke liye sansad ke 30 kaary diwas hai
 He said that he has not received any assurance from the SP and BSP on the issue of FDI which will be discussed and voted on in both houses this week
 haalanki, unhone vishwaas vyakt kiya ki ve (sapa-basapa) upie kaa samarthan karenge
 Kamal Nath said, 'I have reasonable reasons to believe that they (SP, BSP) will vote in favor of the government because they are the responsible party and they will understand its politics
 ve bijepi kii raajnneeti ke paksh main matdaan nahin karenge
 He said, 'at this time i have no assurance from any political party
 mujhe vishwaas he ki main raajnneetik dalon ko yah samajhane main kaamyaab rahoonga ki is mat vibhaajan ke peeche kya he
 'the minister mentioned that he is talking to everyone
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar epadiai par matdaan karne yaa anupasthit rahane ko lekar sadasyon ko apane paksh main karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 Mr Modi and his coterie of cronies, continue to destroy every institution they can get their hands on

 es
 Jagan has worked hard to establish himself as the main challenger to the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Andhra Pradesh since he formed the party after Rajasekhara Reddy's death did not allow him to become chief minister
 congress ke saaf inkaar se chidhe or vittiya gadbaditon ke maamalon se ghire jagan ne congress chhod di thi
 (he has 31 criminal cases pending, including seven cases of money laundering and 11 cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act
 ) aage chal kar jo baat unke paksh main gai, vah thi congress kaa galat samay par andhra pradesh kaa punargathan karte hue telugana ko desh kaa 29waan rajya banane kaa faisla
 This eclipsed the Congress' prospects in Andhra and gave the YSRC an opportunity to grow as an alternative
 nai sarkaar ke saamne kai chunautiyaan hongi
 The first thing is that the treasure is empty
 praathmik chunauti hogi tidipi sarkaar kii 2014 or 2019 ke bich shuru kii gai kuch lokkalyaan yojanaon ko usee rup main yaa kuch badlaav ke saath jari rakhane ke liye sansaadhan jutanaa or apane prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan kiye 'navratnalu' vaadon ko puraa karnaa
 In these promises, small farmers get Rs 50,000
 kaa anudaan dene vaali yojana 'viesar raitu bharosa' he, mahilaon ke swayan sahaayta samoohon ko byaaj mukt rin kaa vaada he or varisht nagarikon or vidhwaaon ko pension ke rup main 2,000 ru
 It is a matter of giving
 paanch saal main garibon ke liye 25 lakh ghar banane, aarogyshri swasthya yojana or charanbaddh tareeke se sharaab par pratibandh ko phir se lagu karne ke vaade bhi inamen hai
 Due to the lack of guaranteed allocation of resources from the Center, it will be difficult to fulfill these big promises in the event of a cash crisis
 dilli main narendra modi sarkaar ke saath viesarsi kii rajnatik maitri hi rajya ko milane vaala dhan pravaah or andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dilaane ke jagan ke vaade kaa bhavishya nirdhaarit karegi
 N
 chandrababu naidu ke netritv main telegu desham party modi sarkaar se yah darja hasil karne main asafal rahi thi
 However, this was promised in Parliament by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh while passing the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Bill, 2014
 rajya ko vishesh darje ke bare main modi sarkaar ke rukh main badlaav laane ke liye jagan ko har tarah kii chaal, yukti or apni baat manwaane ke kaushal kaa istemaal karnaa hoga
 The future of both parties in the state, BJP and YSRC, rests on resolving this tricky issue
 isi vajah se jagan ne parinaam aane ke pehle hi ghoshnaa kii thi ki viesarsi centre main usee party kaa samarthan karegi jo andhra ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene ke liye taiyaar ho
 Another major issue is the construction of the greenfield capital Amravati and the completion of the Polavaram project at Godavari for hydroelectricity production and irrigation
 amravati ke liye bhoomi adhigrahan mudde par naidu ke upar aaropon kii jhadi lagane vaali viesarsi is nagar kaa aakaar chota rakhane yaa phir ise chhod kar prakasham jile main domaconda ke nikat nai rajdhani banane par bhi vichaar kar rahi he
 The originally approved cost of the Polavaram project was Rs
 12,294 karod ru
 (at 2010–11 values)
 yah laagat ab bad kar 55,549 karod ru
 Has been done
 modi sarkaar ne jab is pariyojna ke liye rakam jari karne kaa aagrah thukraa diya tha to naidu ne ekatarfa ghoshnaa kii thi ki ise puraa karne kaa kharch rajya sarkaar uthaaegi
 Congress MP K

 P
 ramchandra raav sanket dete hai ki rajya ko laagat vruddhi ke 28,467 karod rupee chukaane pad sakate hai kyonki centre ne baar-baar kaha he ki vah 2013-14 kii keemton par hi pariyojna laagat vahan karegaa
 Rao has demanded the release of a white paper on the costs and expenses of the Polavaram project while the YSRC chief is putting up a team of officials to issue a white paper on the state's finances before taking office on May 30
 jagan kii anya chunautiyon main un logon kii pahchaan karnaa shaamil hoga jin par ve pehali baar mukhyamantri ke rup main rajya kii jikvamedaariyaan uthaane main madad ke liye bharosa kar sakate hon

 As far as Chandrababu Naidu is concerned, it can haunt him again and again whether it was right for the TDP to contest such an important election without any ally — it was the first time in the 37-year history of this party

 6 reconsideration petitions filed in Ayodhya verdict Here, 6 petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court on Friday, November 9 for reconsideration of the judgment given in the Ayodhya case

 These 6 petitions are supported by All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB)

 AIMPLB said in a statement that it would support filing a reconsideration petition on the verdict and the senior counsel has drafted it given the nature of the case
 jilani ne media karmiyon se kaha ki agar punarvichaar yachikaaon par khuli adaalat main sunwaayee hogi to dhawan court ke samaksh maamle (empielbi samarthit) ko prastut karenge
 What was the decision of the Supreme Court? a five-judge bench headed by the then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi unanimously completed the second

 The mid-day meal scheme, started in 1995, had two goals - to take children to school and provide them with nutritious food
 primary or middle skool ke bacchon ko poshit karne ke samarpit lakshya (450-700 calories or 12-20 gram protein) ko dekhte hue is yojana kaa khule dil se swaagat kiya gaya
 Expectations from the scheme increased further when the central and state governments started funding for the scheme
 centre or rajya sarkaron ke bich is yojana kii funding 60 or 40 pratishat ke anupaat main vibhajit hoti he
 For this scheme, the ratio is between 90 and 10 percent in eight North East states of the country (arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura) and three Himalayan states (jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand)
 At the same time, in the Union Territories from April 2015, the Center provides 100 percent funds

 reporting team ko purv soochna mili thi ki shikshak keval rashtriya tyoharon par skool aate hai- raashtragan gaate hai, bacchon ko mithai khilaate hai, saboot ke liye photo khinchvaate hai or use shiksha vibhaag main jamaa kar dete hai
 Keeping this in mind, the team inspected the school on Republic Day
 jab shikshak se is bare main poocha gaya ki unki atendence kam kyon he to unhone duuri, apni tankhwaah or sthaneey bhashaa main baat karne main apni asamarthta kaa hawala diya
 School teacher Mohammad fasi-ud-jama said, "I speak in Hindi and they speak in Pahadia
 main jo bhi padhaata hum uskaa bahut hi kam ve samaj pate hai
 "when he was asked if he spoke to the authorities about this, he could not give any answer
 unhone bataaya ki mid-de mile ke liye niyamit rup se paisa aata he, jise vah rashan saamagree ke saath gram pradhan ko de dete hai
 Village head Mesa Pahadia said that when the ration came, he was informed about it but neither the mid-day meal is made nor the teachers come to school
 unhone kaha, “hamen chaaval miltaa he, ham khichdi khilaa sakate hai, par bachche nahin aate
 If teachers come, children will also come to school and eat
 ” He also told that instead of distributing rice among the villagers, he used to distribute it during the village meeting and eat it
 unhone kaha, “gram sevak apana kaam karte hai, adhikari bhi karte hai
 But the village teachers do not do their work
 ” The team came to know that many children go hungry like Pinky Paharin due to corruption, theft and lack of surveillance
 ve gambhir kuposhan or sankraman ke shikaar ho jate hai
 However, the Economic Survey of Jharkhand for the year 2015-16 is quite the opposite

 saamaajik kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki ho saktaa he ki isse bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake lekin isse pinki jaise bacchon ko koi madad nahin milegi
 The comments aisi ghatnaon ko dekhte hue sawaal uthte hai kyon sarkaar un 10,000 karod rupayon kaa hisaab nahin rakh rahi jo vah is mahatvakankshi yojana par kharch kar rahi he? or pinki pahadin ke liye koun javabdeh he jise vah poshan nahin mil rahaa jiskaa vaada kiya gaya tha?

 reporting team ko purv soochna mili thi ki shikshak keval rashtriya tyoharon par skool aate hai- raashtragan gaate hai, bacchon ko mithai khilaate hai, saboot ke liye photo khinchvaate hai or use shiksha vibhaag main jamaa kar dete hai
 Keeping this in mind, the team inspected the school on Republic Day
 jab shikshak se is bare main poocha gaya ki unki atendence kam kyon he to unhone duuri, apni tankhwaah or sthaneey bhashaa main baat karne main apni asamarthta kaa hawala diya
 School teacher Mohammad fasi-ud-jama said, "I speak in Hindi and they speak in Pahadia
 main jo bhi padhaata hum uskaa bahut hi kam ve samaj pate hai
 "when he was asked if he spoke to the authorities about this, he could not give any answer
 unhone bataaya ki mid-de mile ke liye niyamit rup se paisa aata he, jise vah rashan saamagree ke saath gram pradhan ko de dete hai
 Village head Mesa Pahadia said that when the ration came, he was informed about it but neither the mid-day meal is made nor the teachers come to school
 unhone kaha, “hamen chaaval miltaa he, ham khichdi khilaa sakate hai, par bachche nahin aate
 If teachers come, children will also come to school and eat
 ” He also told that instead of distributing rice among the villagers, he used to distribute it during the village meeting and eat it
 unhone kaha, “gram sevak apana kaam karte hai, adhikari bhi karte hai
 But the village teachers do not do their work
 ” The team came to know that many children go hungry like Pinky Paharin due to corruption, theft and lack of surveillance
 ve gambhir kuposhan or sankraman ke shikaar ho jate hai
 However, the Economic Survey of Jharkhand for the year 2015-16 is quite the opposite
 iske anusaar rashtriya aankadon kii tulana main rajya ke praathmik or middle skulon ke bacchon ko muft shiksha or mid-de mile kii behatar suvidhaayen praapt hai
 The government has announced that mid-day meals will be given to only those children who have a valid Aadhaar card from July
 saamaajik kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki ho saktaa he ki isse bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake lekin isse pinki jaise bacchon ko koi madad nahin milegi
 The comments aisi ghatnaon ko dekhte hue sawaal uthte hai kyon sarkaar un 10,000 karod rupayon kaa hisaab nahin rakh rahi jo vah is mahatvakankshi yojana par kharch kar rahi he? or pinki pahadin ke liye koun javabdeh he jise vah poshan nahin mil rahaa jiskaa vaada kiya gaya tha?

 He said that there is regular money for the mid-day meal, which he gives to the village head along with the ration material
 gram pradhan mesa pahadiya ne kaha ki jab rashan aayaa tha tab unhen isaki jaankaree di gai thi lekin na hi mid-de mile banataa he or na hi shikshak skool aate hai
 He said, "we get rice, we can feed khichdi, but children don't come

 ! a few years ago a bizarre case came to light at the Jhaliamari Adivasi Ashram Shala in Chhattisgarh
 is adivasee-bahul ilaake main hostel ke wardan ne yah bataate hue baari-baari se kai bacchiyon kaa yon shoshan kiya ki yah sex ajukeshan kaa hissaa he
 The girls also knew how to understand this education, the secret was revealed when the girl here became pregnant
 aise kai maamle saamne aate rahe hai,jinhen samay ke saath keval basi hoti khabaren hi mana gaya
 Sometimes there is Jhaliamari, sometimes Muzaffarpur, and then now Deoria of Uttar Pradesh, where a similar case has been reported in Muzaffarpur
 phoda bada he,jiskaa mawaad ris-riskar yahaan-vahaan nikalataa he
 If it is not able to cure it
 koi gambhir he bhi to nahin,kyonki jo bhoga rahe hai,ve bachche hai
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau, in 2012, 2013 and 2014, 8,541, 12,363 and 13,766 cases of rape of children (under the age of 18) were registered within the country, but how many were punished
 aankade bataate hai ki2012main keval1,447, 2013main keval2,062or2014main2,015aropiyon ko hi doshasiddh kiya ja sakaa
 These are sexual offenses committed against children
 dekhie,aarope lagaae jane or aarope siddh hone main kitna bada antar he
 We are believed here that children are the form of God, and they do not lie
 to kya balaatkaar jaise sangeen aparaadhon main bachche jhooth bol rahe hai yaa un par jo atyaachaar kiye ja rahe hai,unhen siddh hi nahin kiya ja paa rahaa he

 In response to the questions, the government changes the laws, makes amends, makes provisions for maximum sentences, but why do the intentions of criminals do not change even after maximum sentences
 madhya pradesh main sabase pehle12saal tak kii bacchiyon ke saath aparaadhon ke maamalon main faansee kii sazaa ke liye praavdhaan kiya gaya,lekin iske baad bhi madhya pradesh main mandsaur cond jaise desh ke sabase vibhats maamle saamne aae
 One should think that what children are safe in our society, whether the walls protecting them have come down on them

 kuch saal pehle chhattisgarh ke jhaliyamari adivasee ashram shaala main ek vicitra maamla saamne aayaa tha
 The wardens of hostels in this tribal-dominated area sexually abused many girls in turn, stating that it was part of sex education
 ladkiyaan bhi jane kaise ise shiksha samajhati raheen,raaj tab khulaa,jab yahaan kii ladki garbhvatee ho gai
 There have been many such cases, which have been considered only stale news over time
 kabhi jhaliyamari he,kabhi mujaffarpur he,or uske baad ab uttar pradesh kaa devaria,jahaan mujaffarpur jaisaa hi maamla saamne aayaa he

 Statistics show that only 1,447 accused were convicted in 2012, only 2,062 in 2013 and 2,015 in 2014
 ye bacchon ke khilaaf kiye gaye yon aparaadh hai
 See, there is a big difference between being charged and proven
 hamaare yahaan mana jaataa he ki bachche bhagwaan kaa rup hai,or ve jhooth nahin bolte hai
 So whether children are lying in serious crimes like rape or the atrocities that are being perpetrated on them, they are not being proved at all

 nitish kii isi videsh yatra ko lekar argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ne un par hamalaa kiya he or kaha he ki jab tak mukhyamantri bihar ko aaaraseepi tex se mukt nahin karaayenge, tab tak pradesh kaa vikaas nahin hoga
 In such a situation, the question arises that what is this "RCP tax" in Bihar? According to Tejashwi Yadav, RCP tax is being collected in the state in the name of RCP Singh, close to Nitish Kumar and Rajya Sabha MP
 tejasvi kaa aarope he ki jab tak bihar main aaaraseepi tex nahin diya jaataa he, kisi kaa koi kaam nahin hota he
 Tejaswine tweeted that Nitish has gone to Japan to discuss the achievements, merits and prospects of RCP tax in Bihar
 tejasvi ne kaha ki jab tak bihar main aaaraseepi tex lagu rahegaa, tab tak pradesh main koi vikaas yaa nivesh nahin ho saktaa
 Tejashwi demanded that Nitish should first free the state from RCP tax
 vahiin nitish kii japan yatra ko lekar tejasvi ne yah bhi kaha ki unhen japan main apane netritv main bihar main hue 40 ghotaalon, bhrashtachar, lut, apharan, balaatkaar, hatya or daliton par hue atyaacharon ke aankade jarur pesh karne chahie
 Tejashwi said that it is necessary to present all these figures to Nitish in Japan, because in the last 5 months he has not updated all these figures on the website of Bihar government
 nitish par tanj kasate hue tejasvi ne kaha ki agar japan ke logon ko nitish ke bare main baad main yah sab baaten pataa chalenge to behad sharmindagi hogi
 Responding to Tejashwi's attack on RCP tax, JDU spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said that first Tejashwi should tell that between 1991 and 2005 when lalu-rabri was in Bihar and there were 5243 kidnapping cases for ransom in the state
 At whose behest did he and the Lalu family recover the GST (gunda Service Tax)

 yachika main kaha gaya he ki kisi bhi lok sevak ko ek saptaah ke liye bhi sajaa ho jaati he to unako aaajeevan naukari se nikaal diya jaataa he to netaaon ko bhi sajaa hone par jivan bhar ke liye chunaav ladane par roak lagani chahie

 In such a situation, Section 8 of the Representation of the People Act needs to be repealed
 is dhara ke tahat hi koi shaikshanik yogyata na hone par bhi netaaon ke chunaav lard sakane kaa praavdhaan he
 The High Court has fixed December 4 for next hearing on this petition

 But he said that he wants to play the series not in UAE but in India
 ’bisisiai ne kiya khandanbisisiai adhyaksh ne haalanki kaha ki unhone abhi tak manjuuri lene ke liye sarkaar se sampark tak nahin kiya he or is sambandh main koi bhi bayaan sahi nahin he

 He said, 'manohar also said that the Indian Board will provide the best security to our team and will organize matches at places like Mohali and Kolkata where there is no problem in organizing indo-pak matches
 ’pisibi pramukh ne kaha ki unhone haalanki manohar se kaha ki bisisiai ne uske saath jo qaraar kiya uske anusaar pakistan disambar main yuai main hi shrinkhalaa khelnaa chahega
 He said, 'why should we play our home series in India, while the mou talks about playing in the UAE
 iske alaava hamaari team kii suraksha or lagbhag paanch karod dollars kaa bhi sawaal he
 We expect to earn so much from hosting this series
 ’shehryaar ne kaha, ‘maine manohar se kaha ki ham kaise bharat main khel sakate hai jabaki unke kuch samoohon dwaara vahaan bahut adhik pakistan virdohi bhavanaaen vyaapt hai
 We played our last two series in India and now i think the time has come for us to host the series

 He said, 'but the most important thing is that before taking any decision, i have to get approval from the Prime Minister

 Despite the very poor performance of Indian batsmen, young batsman Saurabh Tiwari feels that he will have to return home by playing the role of a tourist again during the ongoing tri-day cricket series here
 sirf tiwari hi kyon spinner aar aswin ko bhi team prabandhan ne koi mauka nahin diya jabaki vah nichle kram main acchhee ballebaaji bhi kar sakate the
 This is not the first time this is happening with Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, a resident of Jharkhand, the state of Jharkhand
 vah is saal june main jab bharat ‘e’ team ke saath england daure par gayi the tab unhen asia cap team main shaamil kiya gaya
 Tiwari felt that he had been replaced in the squad in place of Yuvraj Singh and was also hoping to make it to the playing XI
 tiwari ne tab kaha tha, ‘bharat kii taraf se khilne kaa meraa sapana sach hone ja rahaa he
 i think i will be chosen in place of Yuvraj, so there will be pressure
 ’ is 20 varshiya yuva ballebaaj kaa sapana haalanki ab tak bhi puraa nahin ho paaya he
 Even in the Asia Cup, he did not get a chance to make it to the playing XI
 ab trikoniya shrinkhalaa main bhi vah match khilne kii baat hi johte rahe
 The most important fact is that Tiwari was selected for the Emerging Players Tournament played in Australia but due to being selected in the tri-series, he did not even get the experience of playing in Australia
 vaise yah pehali baar nahin hua jabaki khilaadi videshi dauron par keval tourist banakar gayi
 Since last year, most of the foreign tours of India did not get any chance to play any player
 janvari 2009 main bhartiya team bangladesh main trikoniya shrinkhalaa khilne gayi thi to ashok dinda ne puraa samay dressing room main baithkar bitaayaa tha
 Earlier, fast bowler Sudeep Tyagi was selected in the team for the Test series
 unhone daure par jane se pehle vishwaas jataayaa tha ki vah antim ekadash main jagah banane main safal rahenge lekin aisa nahin ho paaya tha
 After this, when the Indian team went on a tour to New Zealand, Laxmipathy Balaji, Dhawal Kulkarni, Murali Vijay and Amit Mishra did not play matches despite being in the Test team
 iske baad newjiland ke khilaaf van de shrinkhalaa main irfan pathan, dinesh karthik or pragyan ojha jaise khilaadi tourist kii bhoomika nibhaate rahe the
 In the West Indies tour, Murali Vijay, RP Singh and Ojha did not get a chance to play Praveen Kumar, Amit Mishra and Abhishek Nair in the tri-series in Sri Lanka in September 2009
 srilanka main haal main samaapt hui test shrinkhalaa main munaf patel ko khilne kaa mauka nahin mil paaya tha
 He was replaced in the team in place of injured s Sreesanth
 munaf ab ishanth sharma ko cover karne ke liye dambula pahunche or unhen aaj pehali baar team main chunaa gaya
 In the global market, the litchi of China and Thailand will now be seen competing with the royal litchi of Bihar
 iske liye rajya kii prasiddh shahi lichi kii gunvattta main sudhaar or utpaadan kshamta badhaane ke liye ek kaary yojana taiyaar kii gai he
 Due to increased competition in the global market, the National Lychee Research Center has prepared an action plan for the producers of Bihar for a period of one year, in which the state government will also help
 rajya main lichi kii utpaadakta ko dekhte hue bhartiya krishi anusandhan parishad ne varsh 2001 main mujffarpur main lichi ke liye ek rashtriya shodh santhaan kii sthapana kii he
 Litchi is cultivated in many such districts in the state, but Muzaffarpur is the main center of litchi cultivation
 rashtriya shodh santhaan ke nideshak vishaal nath ne ieenes se kaha ki acchhee fasal kii jimmevary khud kisaan uthaaenge
 He said that under the Mission of Horticulture (horticulture), a program has been prepared in view of good management and best quality, under which the program of training of litchi farmers was started by the trainers from Wednesday
 unhone bataaya ki shahi lichi kii gunvattta main koi kami nahin he lekin ise or uttam karne kii taiyaari chal rahi he, jisamen takanic kaa prayog kiya ja rahaa he
 This training is being provided to the farmers of the five litchi producing districts of the state, Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Vaishali, Motihari and Sitamarhi
 unhone bataaya ki yah prashikshan prakhand str tak ke kisaanon ko diya jayega
 Another scientist said that if the scheme and the hard work of the farmers are successful, then an acre can earn up to 10 lakhs
 mitti ke swasthya or keet prabandhan kii bhi vyavastha is yojana main kii gai he
 The government will also provide financial assistance to the farmers working on the scheme
 is yojana se vibhinn kaarnon se hone vaali 20 se 25 pratishat lichi kii kshati ko roka ja sakegaa
 It is noteworthy that Thailand and China have greatly improved the quality of litchi in recent times
 pratiyogita main bane rahane ke liye bihar ko bhi is par dhyaan dena hoga
 Bihar has the most demand for royal litchi among European countries including Britain
 vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki gunvattta main sudhaar hui to niryaat badhane se kisaanon kii aamadani badhegi
 Several types of litchi are produced in the state including Shahi, China, Logia, Bekhana but the production of Shahi and China litchi is highest
 desh ke kul lichi utpaadan main bihar kii hissedari 74 pratishat he
 In Bihar, litchi is cultivated on a total of 30,600 acres of land
 rajasthan ke mevaat kshetra main khanan mafiaon kaa khauf kis kadar badhata ja rahaa he isaki baangi tab dekhne ko mili jab pradesh ke khufia vibhaag ke atirikt mahanideshak (ediji) utkal ranjan sahu ne alvar ke espi vikaas kumaar ko haal hi chitthee likhakar khanan mafiaon se satark rahane ko kaha
 The letter said, "mining mafia and Meo fanatics have resented the campaign against criminals in Alwar
" unase aapaki suraksha ko khatra ho saktaa he
 In fact, Kumar has been campaigning against illegal mining in Alwar
 janvari 2014 se ab tak unhone avaidh khanan ke khilaaf ek hajaar se adhik karrwai kii or saat sau se adhik logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Yet the black mining business of illegal mining in Alwar, Bharatpur, Dhaulpur and Karauli districts is not taking its name
 yahaan khanan mafiaon kii aapas main yaa police se aae din hinsak jhadpen hone lagi hai
 On April 2, two people were killed and five others were injured in a clash between two groups of mining mafia in Nagal Kresar zone of the hill station area of bharatpur district
 is ghatana ke kuch hi din pehle, 18 march ko karauli jile ke masalpur thana kshetra main khanan rokane gai police par khanan mafiaon ne hamalaa kar diya tha
 From here, the police seized a truck and mining machine full of stones
 avaidh khanan ke mukhya centre alvar main teen saal main khanan mafia ne pachaas se zyada baar police or van vibhaag ke dal par hamalaa kiya he
 On February 16, during the Operation Green campaign for the prevention of illegal mining in the Rajgarh area of alwar, two tractor drivers carrying the illegal mining stone near the hut Nangal village dragged the Forest Department's government car up to fifty feet Was
 supreme court kii roak ke baavjood behad hinsak ho chuke khanan mafia alvar sthit aravali kii paharipoon main avaidh khanan lagaataar jari rakhe hue hai
 Due to illegal mining, the hills are disappearing from Bhiwadi, Tapukra, Tijara and Kishangarhbas area
 alvar main diefo rah chuke pi
 According to Kathirvel's estimation, mining mafias in Bhiwadi region have spent 50 thousand crores in the last 15 years
 kaa avaidh khanan kiya he or khanan isi raftaar se jari rahaa to is kshetra ke pahaad teen saal main khatm ho jaaenge
 a report of the Forest Department itself states that Mafia of Haryana is also widespread in Chitrapur, Udhanwas, Ulavat, Gwalada, Indore, Saare Kalan, Saare Khurd, Khohari Kalan, Mayapur, Chhapur, Nakhanaul, Kaharani, Banban, Jiwana, Nimbadi in the Tapukda region
 Are spread over the level
 or yahaan ke kareeb ek hajaar hectare ilaake main pahaad khatm ho chuke hai
 After the mountains reached the verge of extinction, the mafias spread their business in Tijara and Kishangarhbas and started mining in the mountains of Neemali, Baghore, Devta, Manchha region
 kathiravel ke mutabik, 1998 se 2003 ke bich ek hajaar vaahanon se prati din do trip ke hisaab se chah hajaar karod ru
 Illegal mining took place
 isi tarah 2003 se 2008 ke bich 12 hajaar karod ru
 And between 2008 and 2013 Rs 30 thousand crore
 kaa avaidh khanan hua he
 The biggest problem in stopping mining is that the people associated with this business have huge quantities of explosives and illegal weapons, compared to which the resources of the police are not enough
 dhaulpur ke espi rajesh singh kehete hai, ''khanan mafia ke log gut banaakar chalate hai
 These people do not refrain from taking the life of those coming in the way of mining, no matter how big an officer is
 ''hinsak rukh akhriyaar kar chuke khanan mafia ke hausale itane buland hai ki ab unke danpar police chaowkee, thanon or van vibhaag kii chaukiyon ke saamne se bekhauf nikalate hai
 And they are not afraid to suppress the voice against them

 This claim is not of any Hinduist organization in the country, but of a team of Australian young scientists
 bhavishya main aircraft kaise honge or unamem kis tarah kaa eendhan istemaal hoga, iske bare main in dinon europe main ek muqabla chal rahaa he
 In this, young scientists from all over the world had to present their ideas or models
 europe kii plane banane vaali company airbas ne is mukaable kaa aayojan kiya tha
 Of the five ideas shortlisted in the last one, one of them was also flying a plane with cow dung
 team clima naam ke vaigyanik dal kaa daawa he ki gaay ke gobar or farm main paidaa hone vaale duusare kachare se banane vaali methane gas ko plane main bataur eendhan istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 According to the model, this gas will be cooled a lot and filled in a special mold
 ise plane ke ingine ke saath feet kiya jayega
 From here the fuel supply will continue according to the need of the engine
 magar abhi is model main ek dikkat bhi he
 Actually, according to the amount of fuel needed to fly the plane, dung will be reduced
 is vaikalpik eendhan par kaam karne vaale bataate hai ki ek gaay salbhar main jitna gobar detii he, usase 70 galen eendhan taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Taking the example of a flight from London to New York, the flight required 17,500 gallons of fuel for this flight covering a distance of three and a half thousand miles
 is tarah maujuuda dar se dekhen, to 1 hajaar gaay teen maheene main jitna gobar karengi, usase paidaa hui gas is ek flite main bataur eendhan kharch ho jaaegi
 That is why scientists are currently doing such experiments, in which at least dung can be produced as much gas as possible
 yadi ye prayog safal rahaa, to paryaavaran ke liye bhi behatar hoga
 The Klima team estimates that dung fuel can reduce carbon dioxide formation by up to 97 percent
 methane kaa plane udaane ke liye bataur eendhan pehali martabaa istemaal hoga, lekin america main kheti main kaam aane vaale kai vaahan isi tarah ke eendhan se chalate hai
 Its process is very simple
 gaay-bhens ke gobar or farm par paidaa hone vaale duusare kachare ko ek tanks main store kiya jaataa he
 Methane gas is produced in this tank after sunlight, which is used as fuel
