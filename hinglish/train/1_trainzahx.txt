 jab bhi puraane hindi gaanon kii baat hoti he to kuch bemisaal awaazon main ek naam mukesh kaa hota he
 While Kishore Kumar and Mohammed Rafi were known for their variations on the one hand, Mukesh had a different style
 unke gaae gaanon main ek aisa tehraav he jo aapako dard main bhi raahat detaa he, unhen sunate hue lagata he ki aap kisi pahaad par pahunch gaye hai jahaan aatma ko sukun deni vaali bepanaah shanti he
 July 22 means today the 93rd birth anniversary of veteran playback singer Mukesh
 google ne is maukey par mukesh kii yaad main ek doodle bhi taiyaar kiya he - By the way, the memorable songs of Mukesh are not obedient on any one day, but we are bringing some special songs that should be heard or seen on this occasion - vaise to rajesh khanna or amitabh bachchan kii yaadgaar film 'anand' main mukesh kaa gaaya ek ek geet itnaa madhur he ki ek list main to sirf is film ke hi gane samaa jaaen
 Currently two songs from this film have been included in this list
 'kahin dur jab din dhal jaae' is geet kii kalnpa kisi or kii awaz main nahin kii ja sakati
 This song from the superhit film 'kabhi Kabhi', in which Mukesh has done justice in this way, with the poem written by Sahir
 rajkpur kii filme jaise mukesh kii awaz ke bagaiyr adhuri hoti thim
 'anari' was one such film
 film 'shri 420' main 'ramaiya vastavaiya' jaisaa romantic geet shaayad hi dobaaraa ban paaya This song from the film 'mera Naam Joker' which explains the philosophy of life very deeply
 'kabhi kabhi' kaa hi ek or ahm geet 'main pal do pal kaa shaayar hum' Who can play songs full of philosophy better than Mukesh
 tippaniyan 'we learned everything, we did not learn intelligence' Mukesh was also known for his singing away from controversies
 'teesri kasam' main agar kahani ke saath saath rajkpur ke abhinay ne jaan foonki to shailendra ke geet or mukesh kii gayaki ne bhi chaar chand laga die
 Maybe your choice about Mukesh's songs is different from the songs in this list, then share your list with us in the comment box below
 acchhee baat yah hogi ki aapaki or hamaari suchi main ek naam samaan hoga - vah he mukesh
 
 
 By the way, a song sung by Mukesh in Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan's memorable film 'anand' is so sweet that only the songs of this film can be included in a list
 philhal is soochi main is film ke do gane shaamil kiye gaye hai
 'kahin far jab din din dhal jaye' This song cannot be performed in the voice of anyone else
 superhit film 'kabhi kabhi' kaa yah geet jisamen sahir kii likhi kavita ke saath mukesh ne kuch is tarah nyaay kiya he
 Films like Raj Kapoor were incomplete without Mukesh's voice
 'anaadi' bhi aisi hi ek film thi
 a romantic song like 'ramaiya Vastavaiya' could hardly be remade in the film 'shree 420' film 'meraa naam joker' kaa yah geet jo jindagi ke falsafe ko behad gaharaai se samajhaata he
 Another important song of 'kabhi Kabhi' is 'I am a poet of two moments' falsafon se bhare geeton ko mukesh se acha koun nibhaa saktaa he
 The comments 'sab kuch siikhaa hamane na sikhi hoshiyaari' mukesh bhi vivaadon se dur apni gayaki ke liye hi jane jate rahe In 'teesri Kasam', if the acting of Raj Kapoor along with the story burnt, then Shailendra's song and Mukesh's singing also set the tone
 ho saktaa he ki mukesh ke geeton ko lekar aapaki pasand is list main shaamil gaanon se alag ho, to neeche coment box main apni list hamaare saath saajha kiijie
 The good thing will be that you and our list will have one name - Mukesh

 gambhir ne kaha ki unke man main aisa kuch nahin he naa hi vah aisa kuch soch kar kolkata ke liye ipel main acha pradarshan kar rahe hai
 It will be selfish and not like this

 Gambhir said, "I certainly agree that a good T20 performance does not open the way for you to choose an ODI team
" agar aap is prakaar se team kaa chayan karnaa shuru karenge, to isse 50 overon vaale gharelu pratiyogita kii koi manyata nahin rah jaaegi
 "not performing the Champions Trophy keeping in mind Gambhir, who scored the second highest score in this season of IPL, has scored 411 runs in 11 matches played so far

 Gambhir said that this is a misunderstanding of people who are thinking that he is doing this to join the Indian team
 vah vartmaan main achche pradarshan ke liye kadi mehnat karne vaale khilaadiyon main se hai
 Gambhir added, "the moment i think about scoring in the IPL with the Champions Trophy in mind, it will be called selfish at that moment
" ek captain hone ke naate aap aisa nahin kar sakate
 If i start thinking about this, there are many players in Kolkata team who will start thinking about it
 yah sahi nahin
 You should always be in the present
 yah sab apane aap hoti hai or agar nahin bhi hoti, to bhi thik he

 The world was astonished when Maya Mrig joined a number of people writing on Facebook and published a book about women, 'woman becomes a question'
 shuddhtavaadiyon ne is faisle kaa makhul bhi udaaya lekin yah kitaab khub makabool hui
 'maya Mrig' is an excellent poet and runs his own Bodhi publication in Jaipur
 unka prakaashan grih lagaataar nae taur-tareekon se kitaaben chhapata he
 He is a brilliant poet himself
 pesh he unase baatcheet
 You write great poems, are publishers, attend many events
 itani sakriyata kii urja kahaan se milti he?kavita likhane ke liye alag se samay kahaan chahie hota he, vah to har kaam karte hue aapke saath hi jiti he, rahati he
 Participation in programs, poetry and publishing are all similar works
 ek duusare ke poorak, ek duusare ko madad karte hue
 Reading helps writing and publishing also motivates you to participate in programs
 isliye in sab kaamon ko ek hi maanata hum to itnaa to koi kar hi saktaa he ki ek kaam karata rahe
 If the matter is about energy then the work in itself is energetic in itself
 patrkaar se lekhak or prakaashak kii yatra ke bare main bataaen
 Also, tell us what challenges the Hindi publisher faces? You can increase it further by saying teacher to journalist, journalist to publisher
 ye sab ek hi mul samvednaa ke vistaar se jude kshetra hai
 Taught a few years in school-college, even then, he was fond of writing and occasionally printed columns in newspapers
 kuch samay baad sarkari bandhanon ke bich padhaa sakna ub paidaa karne laga
 It was felt that time gets worse and in the name of work, teaching two to three periods in a day, in that too frequent holidays or absence of students or being engaged in non-academic work
 laga ki isi tarah chalata rahaa to nikamma ho jaaoongaa
 i did not fit into that arrangement, although i love teaching today and love the teacher's work very much but i could not, but still cannot, teach between those bonds
 to naukari chhodkar ek akhbaar main aa gaya
 There was always a feeling about the newspaper that something good could be done through this medium, but even this confusion could not last long
 haalanki bahut kuch siikhaa is bich, par kar kuch khaas nahin paaya
 Even then the story still makes sense, but how did you decide to become a publisher? The attachment to books was from childhood, so the work of publishing was good
 abhi tak acha lag rahaa he, kar rahaa hum
 The day it has become unusable, i will be out for this area, i will see something else
 prakaashan ke kaam main failaav bahut he
 People have to work at many levels
 ek taraf lekhak jaise buddhijivi ke saath samvaad main rahanaa hota he to duusari taraf, compositor se lekar binder tak har tarah ke vyakti se vaasta padataa he
 At any stage, one mistake can overwhelm hard work
 yah to hui production kii baat
 The arrangements regarding the sale of books are nothing hidden
 sarkari kharid kaa ajeeb gadbadjhaalaa apni jagah or hindi me pathakon kii talash apni jagah
 Challenges are in every work, so do not be afraid of them now
 hindi vaale ronaa rote hai ki hindi kii kitaaben ab log nahin padhate or aap ek ke baad ek kitaaben chhap rahe hai
 Are readers really reduced or we are not able to reach them? Yes, it is true that there has been a decrease in Hindi readers or to say that the number has not developed as much as the possibilities are
 lekin yah kami nagaron or mahanagaron main hi adhik he
 Small towns and villages still have immense potential
 hamane kasbon or gaanvon main pustak pradarshnee kii shrunkhlaa shuru kii hui he, lagbhag har jagah shandaar rispance mila he, yah kaam ab bhi jari he
 There is a need to leave the fascination of the metros and find the right place for the readers
 hamen ashwast rahanaa chahie ki hindi main pathak khatm nahin hue, mahanagaron main talashne kii bajaay unhen kasbon or gaanvon main talasha janaa chahier, jahaan ki ve hai
 Social media has given people a new medium of expression but it is still taken seriously
 lekin aapane to fasebuk par likhi kataranon par kavita chhap di?soshal media hamaare samay kaa nayaa madhyam he
 It has given a big exposure
 ve sab jo chupchaap likhte rahe, idhar udhar chhipate rahe yaa ki diariyon or kaapiyon main band karke rakhte gaye, jinhen naa to prakaashan sambandhi adhik jaankaree thi naa hi aisa koi prayaas karne kii manshaa jinamein thi, un sabko ghar baithe ek manch mil gaya
 This was the reason that a large number of housewives, youth and especially those who were never recognized in the mainstream of Hindi literature, suddenly appeared on this platform
 bhale hi inaki abhivyakti main utani paripakvata nahin he lekin swaabhaaviktaa ar kehane ke liye man kii baat inke paas zarur he
 Describe the sequence when you decided to give Facebook writing a bookish appearance
 fasebuk kii diwaar se kavitaayen kitaab tak kaise pahunchi?teen saal pehle hamane fasebuk par likhane vaale rachanakaaron se stri vishyon par kendrit kavitaayen mangakar pustak prakashit kii
 'being a woman makes a question' was an experiment, which received tremendous appreciation on Facebook and other readers as well
 ab tak iske teen print aa chuke hai
 As an independent book, we published books titled Salim Shujaa Ansari's 'facebook Ke Abbazan' and another poet's 'lalitha Lalit's Facebook Poems' which were well received by the readers
 abhi fasebuk ke 100 rachanakaaron kaa ek sankalan prakashnadhin he, jo sambhavat vishwa pustak mela 2015 main dilli main jari kiya jayega
 How did the literary community react to this issue
 log soshal media kii kavita ko gambhirtha se lete hai?gambhirtha se is madhyam ko ve log nahin lenge jinako is madhyam se aane vaali badi sankhya daraati he
 Those who think that such a large number of writers come will endanger their particularity
 ve apane aapako is bheed ke saath aaidentifi nahin karnaa chaahate
 Such monasteries will break the monastery, which is why they are upset
 jo log jenuan hai ve in nae rachanakaaron kii kamjor abhivyakti main aage ke liye sambhaavnaaen talash rahe hai
 Many new creators have started making their own place in literature by starting the journey from Facebook and writing very well
 fasebuk par bikhri kavitaaon ko kitaab main dhaalane kaa khyaal kis tarah aayaa?fasebuk se lekar rachanaaen chhapane kaa vichaar isi vajah se bana ki yah dharna toote ki yah koi samay kharaab karne kaa yaa vyarth bahasabaaji kaa yaa keval abhaasi manch he
 There really is no difference between virtual and real world if you are not present here with fake ID
 madhyam koi bhi acha yaa bura upyog karne waalon se banataa he yah aap par he ki yahaan porn picks dekhen yaa kavitaayen
 Will this stage of poetry be acceptable to the mandarins? Any kind of stress that you have had to face on this experiment? Due to the publication of the book of the creators of Facebook, many mandarins mocked the Bodhi publication at the time of the last book fair as a febbookia publisher, issued false survey results and gave Facebook creators Fake tried to fly in the air by telling the creator
 hamen laga ise or gambhir prayaason se hi jawaab diya ja saktaa he, is saal 100 rachanakaaron kii kitaab aane vaali he isi kadi main
 Here it is definitely important that those who make fun of Facebook creators themselves run all their activities on Facebook itself and also find importance
 nikat bhavishya kii kya yojanaayen hai, kya fasebuk kavitaaon par koi or bhi kitaab laane kaa vichaar he?ji haa, fasebuk 100 kaviyon ke baad is manch par maujuud navageetkaaron, gazalakaaron or gadhy kii vidhaon ke liye bhi isi tarah ke sankalan par vichaar chal rahaa he
 Apart from this, on the talented creators on Facebook, the vision of publication remains constant, they can be requested for independent compilation
 iske alaava pustak parv shrunkhlaa (sau rupee main das kitaaben) ke chauthe set kii taiyaari he
 Books focusing on certain subjects are also under consideration or published

 In fact, a new cricket stadium has been built in Perth where international cricket matches will now be held
 vaise australian diggaj denis lily is baat se khush nahin hai

 is maidan par sunil gavaskar, mohinder amarnath or sachin tendulkar jaise bhartiya diggajo ne shatkeey paariyaan khelin or ise bhartiya phans ke liye bhi yaadgaar bana diya
 For Indian fans, the best memory of Perth's Waka Ground is in the 2008 Test match when India won in Australia
 captain anil kumble kii aguai main perth test main bharat ne australia ko 72 ranon se haraa diya tha
 The centuries of Sunil Gavaskar, Mohinder Amarnath and Sachin Tendulkar on the Perth pitch played an important role in earning him the status of greatness
 perth kii pich kii ginati duniya kii sabase tej pichon main hoti rahi
 After scoring a century on Perth in 1992, Sachin said, "one innings that changed my career was my innings played in Perth in 1992

 "comments vaaka ground par eeffel, rugby, footbaal or kai khelon kii suvidhaayen maujuud hai, lekin ye maidan sabase mashhoor cricket ke liye rahaa he
 Many veterans did not approve of Waka's association with cricket, so former Test cricketer Dennis Lillee resigned as Waka president
 perth ke berswood (burswood) main ek nayaa stadium taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he jo 2018 main taiyaar ho jayega
 That is, if you talk about cricket even after going to Perth, then the waka will be remembered only as part of some fantastic historical stories

 On behalf of India, first Secretary of the Ministry of External Affairs (east) Vijay Thakur Singh and later First Secretary in the Permanent Mission of India to UNHRC, Vyashan Aryan responded to Pakistan's arguments and made Pakistan wonderful
 bharat ne UNHRC ke manch par kya tark rakhe, yahaan padhein

 sanyukt raashtra maanavadhikaar parishad (yuanechaarsi) main pakistan ne jammu-kashmir ke bare main galat or managasaint kahani pesh kii he
 According to its constitutional framework, India has decided on Article 370
 2
 India will not accept any foreign intervention on this issue, as it is its internal matter
 3
 Pakistan is the center of terrorism and conducts cross-border terrorism as an alternative diplomacy
 bharat maanavdhikaron ko badhaava dene or uski raksha karne main dridhtaa se vishwaas karata he
 4
 jo log kshetra main kisi bhi rup main aatankwaad ko badhaava dene va vittiya taur par iskaa samarthan karte hai, vastav main vahi maanav adhikaron ke sabase bade hanankarta hai
 5
 pakistan peedit banane kaa ronaa ro rahaa he, jabaki vastav main vah khud maanavadhikaron ke hanan kaa apradhi he
 We should curb those who are abusing this platform for malicious political agendas under the guise of human rights
 6
 These people (pakistan) are trying to speak on the human rights of the minorities of other countries, while they are trampling them in their own country, they are crying like a victim, when in fact they are criminals
 7
 India was followed by a full debate by the Indian Parliament on Article 370, like other legislations passed by Parliament

 8
 is faisle se sampatti par adhikaar or sthaneey nikaayon main pratinidhitiv samet langik bhedbhaav kaa ant hoga, bal adhikaron kaa behatar sangrakshan hoga
 There will also be protection against domestic violence
 shiksha, soochna or kaam kaa adhikaar kanoon lagu hoga or sharnaarthiyon or vanchiton ke khilaaf bhedbhaav samaapt hoga

 Those who do not have a Namo app in their phone will be shared a link to download the Namo app
 party kii koshish he ki namo ap ke madhyam se namo agen ke product (tii-shart, cap, mag aadi) bhi logon tak pahunchaae jaaen
 Namo Rath is a part of bjp's election campaign which will go to the corners of the country and ask people to vote for BJP
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne 4 march ko dilli party mukhyalay se is rath ko hari jhandi dikhaakar ravaanaa kiya tha

 mumbai hamale kii 10veen barsi ke maukey par america kii ore se pakistan ko kadi fatkaar lagaai gai he
 The US is considering trying every possible way to convince Pakistan that it is in its own interest to take action against terrorist groups
 iske alawcamericake kai export kaa maananaa he ki agar pakistan kii ore se bharat main 26 / 11 jaisaa koi hamalaa hota he to donon deshon ke bich main yuddh chhid saktaa he
 The US government official said, "the center of all the debates is not to declare Pakistan a sponsor of terrorism
" charchaaen isliye hai ki pakistan ko yah samajhane ke liye anya tareekon kaa istemaal kaise kiya jaae ki aatankwaadi samoohon par karrwai karnaa uske apane hit main he
 According to the language of the news agency, the official said that the option is to choose Pakistan to cooperate in action against terrorists and take advantage of close ties with the US and the rest of the world or to change their attitude to international isolation
 Face it
 ’’beete hafte fox news ko die intervyuu main, twitor par or white house main samvaadadaata sammelan main america raashtrapati donald trump ne pakistan par aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf karrwai ke maamle main america ke liye kuch nahin karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The IAIS, a new name of awe and terror, released videos of two Japanese citizens after their hostage last week
 video ke saath dhamkee kii gai ki agar japan sarkaar unhen 1200 karod rupee de to wo donon ko chhod denge, donon ke sir kalam kar die jaaenge
 The deferment has passed, the Government of Japan neither gave the money nor does it accept the remaining demands of the terrorists
 anjaam phir vahi khooni video saamne aayaa
 All the complaints, requests, requests, appeals, requests were not received
 balki yun kahen ki in guzaarishon kii oot main puri duniya jis karishme kii ummid paale baithi thi, aakhirkaar vaisaa nahin ho sakaa
 In this world of executioners, neither was any charisma possible nor did it happen
 or duniya ke sabase khaufnak aatankwaadi sanghathan iesas ne ek-ek kar donon japani bandhakon kaa sir dhad se alag kar diya
 Rather than just cut it apart, after capturing one moment picture of such non-human activity in the camera, its video was also released in front of the world
 un darindon ne bataa diya ki unase bada beraham or unase bada vahashi is duniya main or koi ho hi nahin saktaa
 What did that mother not do for the sake of her son's life, she kept on requesting to spare her son's life day and night by folding his hands with the person above
 wo apane pradhanmantri shinjo abe ke daravaaje par dastak dekar koi asardaar kadam uthaane ke liye guhaar lagaati rahi
 She kept trying to melt the heart of terrorists by holding a press conference
 kahati rahi ki unka betaa bahut acha insaan he, wo hameshaa dusron kii madad karata he
 In such a situation, the terrorists should also have mercy on their son
 lekin aatankwaadiyon ko naa to raham karnaa tha or naa hi unhone kiya
 The poor, who demanded a huge ransom of $ 200 million or 12 hundred crore rupees to replace the two Japanese hostages, beheaded one by one if the demand was not met
 japan ke freelans patrkaar kenji goto or kaarobaari haruna uakava ko bandhak banane ke baad in aatankwaadiyon ne jab pehali baar donon kaa video jari kiya tha, tabhi puri duniya ko un par mandaraate khatre kaa ahsaas ho gaya tha
 Because earlier ISIS had beheaded American journalist James Foley, British journalist Steven Sautloff, British human rights activist David Hanes, British hostage Alan Hanning and US aid worker Peter Cassing
 kehete hai naa, jab tak saans tab tak aas
 By the time Goto and Yukawa were out of breath, their family members were holding hope
 lekin ab naa to saanse bachi hai or naa hi koi ummid
 On January 24, Kenji Goto's death countdown was announced to begin after he beheaded businessman Haruna Yukawa
 thik 7 din baad 31 janvari ko unhone goto ke saath bhi vahi suluk kiya, jo uakava yaa phir usase pehle maare gaye bandhakon ke saath kiya tha
 Jihadi John, the most notorious butcher of ISIS, also beheaded Goto with his own hands
 darasal, iesas islamic state kii ladaai main visthapit hone vaale logon or tamaam nagarikon ko japan kii ore se gaiyr samrik madad kiye jane kii vajah se bhi khafa tha
 Meanwhile, when two Japanese hostages hit him, he first tried to recover a hefty amount from the Japanese government
 lekin jab japan ne is maamle main koi lacheela rukh nahin apanaaya, to pehle maut kaa count dian shuru hone kii baat kah kar japani kaarobaari uakava kii jaan lee or tab patrkaar goto kii
 However, even now Japan has said not to change its policies
 balki ye bhi kaha he ki wo aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf ladate rahenge
 When ISIS releases a video of a hostage on camera, it usually kills it
 ab tak usne saat baar aisa kiya he or saaton baar usne sir kalam kiye
 But for the first time apart from these seven videos, he released a new video last week
 wo bhi bilukla nae lokation se
 In this video, a soldier is shown killing
 lekin us faujee ko maarane se pehle pehali baar iesas white house main ghuskar america raashtrapati ko maarane kii dhamkee detaa he
 ISIS has been using media and social media from the beginning to spread fear across the world
 isaki madad se wo nae-nae ladakon ke brain wash karata he or phir unhen apane saath jod letaa he
 The boys of many countries of the world have wandered to Syria and Iraq
 ab vahi iesas khauf or dehshat kii nai tasviren duniya ko dikhaane ke liye apana khud kaa tivi channel laa rahaa he
 Abu Bakr al-baghdadi, the ISIS mentor who snatched the world's peace, has taken a new decision and that is isis's decision to launch a TV channel of its own
 isse pehle duniya ne iesaies ke aatank kii jitani bhi tasviren dekhi hai wo sab kisi duusare tivi channel ke jariye dekhi hai
 But now the world will see all the pictures of ISIS terror on its TV channel and it has named its TV channel 'the Islamic Caliphate Broadcast'
 ' itnaa hi nahin iesas ne apane is tivi channel kaa ek 'promo' bhi jari kiya he, taaki duniya ko pataa chale ki iesas kya-kya karne vaala he
 Explain that this will be the first such 24-hour online TV channel to be run by a terrorist organization
 ek report ke mutabik, aatankiyon kaa nayaa tivi channel khilafalive
 will be broadcast from the website named info
 iskaa test signal bhi shuru ho chukaa he
 khilafalive has been written on its test card posted on Twitter
 ek website kii report ke mutabik, ye 24x7 online propeganda channel hoga or isamen ek british bandhak jon cantali se bataur pregenter ek program pesh karavaaya jayega
 John Cantley's program 'time to recruit' will be on air every Wednesday evening
 is tivi channel ke alaava iraq ke mosul shahar main iesas pehle se hi al-bayaan naam kaa ek efem radio stesan bhi chalaa rahaa he, jisamen sirf or sirf islamic state kaa prachaar kiya jaataa he
 The efforts of ISIS supporters on Twitter to recruit media and technology people for the new TV channel are going on in full swing
 jaankaron kii maane to iesas kii khooni fouj main sirf khatarnaak aatankwaadi hi nahin hai balki internet, soshal media, radio or tivi channel kii takanic kii jaankaree rakhane vaale export bhi maujuud he
 With his help, he will now broadcast pictures of his horror across the world
 idhar iesas aantak kaa jaal lagaataar failaata ja rahaa he, udhar tamaam koshishon ke baavjood america or europea desh iesas kaa ab tak khaatmaa nahin kar sake hai
 Nor has its presence on social media and the internet been erased
 lihaaja, ab agar iesas kaa tivi channel vajood main aata he to bagdadi or uske jallaad gurgey chote parde par kya-kya sitam doharaaenge kaha nahin ja saktaa
 Every time ISIS has released its video, the same executioner appears with a dagger in the hands behind the mask
 lanbaa-chaudaa ye jallaad pehle camere par angreji main kuch bolta he or phir camere ke saamne hi sir kalam ker detaa he
 Now the question is, who is this? Where did he come from and why does he do this? In the pictures that rocked the world, every time the head cut off was of a new person, but every time the cutting hands were of the same person
 is jallaad kii pahchaan he
 
 
 Name: Jihadi John Recognition: isis's Terrorism: Beating the Heads of the Innocents: Because of the craze of beheading his innocents, the reality of the worldwide infamous Jihadi John came to the fore for the first time when ISIS killed the innocents and warned the US and Britain On August 21, a video was released for the first time of journalist James Foley being beheaded
 darasal, is video main pehle jihadi jon ne iesas par kiye ja rahe hamalon kaa virodh kiya
 But despite having a mask on his face, the security agencies recognized him with his voice and English-speaking style
 ye kaatil koi or nahin, balki vahi jihadi jon tha jo kabhi britain main rahata tha or iesas main shaamil hone ke iraade se vahaan se bhaag niklaa
 In the meantime, it was also reported that in an airstrike, Jihadist John has been badly injured and is on the verge of death
 lekin ab is nae video main wo japani bandhakon ke peeche apane haath main chaaku pakade thik usee andaaj main khadaa he jo video iesas ne isse pehle jari kiye the
 The river has no color
 nadi bahna jaanati he
 The river flows from time to time beyond eternity
 nadi khamosh gavaah he
 She sees everything pratikaar nahin karti
 Still it continues to flow silent and immense
 nadi kii yahi gaatha jab shabdon main dhalati he, to jamuni nadi kii vyathaa katha saamne aati he
 Malini Gautam is a professor of English
 nadi ke is bahaav kaa dard unhone hindi main bayaan kiya he
 a river sometimes takes the form of a woman, sometimes a girl
 har nadi ek kahani he jisaki kal kal bahati laharon main aap koi bhi rang talash sakate hai
 This color is sometimes of deception, sometimes of cracking relationships, but the flow of the river proves that the brightest color is of love
 malini kii kavitaayen bhi pyaar kii dastaan bayaan karti he
 This color of love sometimes sparkles like a purple river, sometimes it becomes an umbrella to show how women become pivots for the family
 har stri ke andar sukh or dukh kii ek nadi bahati he
 This collection is the confluence of many such rivers
 isamen chote-chote dukh hai chote-chote sukh, lekin aakhir main ummid kaa rang sabase chatkh or gadha he
 Just like a sparrow, who has been sitting in the yard of the house since when a piece has not been waiting for sunlight
 amaltas ke pile surkh phulon kaa yauvan he to ishk ke sookhe patton kii dastaan bhi usee shiddat se hai
 The insistence of finding footprints in the rain
 har kavita apane samay kaa sankshipt dastavej he or is lihaaj se malini apni baat kehane main kaamyaab rahi hai
 These poems of Malini are meaningful in the sense that there is no boasting of words here
 ye kavitaayen nadi kii tarah bahati hai, jo padhate-padhate kab aapke man ko nam kar den pataa bhi nahin chalata

 a post shared by Malaika Arora (@malaikaaroraofficial) on Nov 11, 2019 at 2:48am PST Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's salary should be increased, in an effort to soften the tone of criticism over the salary hike of Delhi mlas
 apni sarkaar ke faisle kaa bachaav karte hue kejariwal ne kaha ki vruddhi lagu hone ke baavjood vidhayak media pratishthanon ke sampadakon or tivi ankaron kii kamai kii tulana main 120waan hissaa bhi nahin kama paaenge
 The comments janalokapal par charchaa ke dauraan dilli vidhansabha main kejariwal ne kaha ‘‘ek lakh rupee prati maah kaise tarksangat nahin he? agar pradhanmantri kaa vetan isse kam he to unka vetan badhaayaa janaa chahie
 We all demand that his salary be increased
 ’’ At the same time Kejriwal also said, "if Obama meets tomorrow, what will he say?" yah (modi kaa vetan) kam se kam 8-10 lakh hona chahie
 He said "it is important to give proper salary and other facilities to the mlas but if they still indulge in corruption then they will not be spared
" ’’ Defending the decision of his government, Kejriwal said that despite the increase being implemented, mlas would not be able to earn even 120th of the earnings of editors and TV anchors of media establishments
 tippaniyan During the discussion on Jan Lokpal, Kejriwal said in the Delhi Assembly, "how is one lakh rupees per month not rational?" If the Prime Minister's salary is less than this, then his salary should be increased
 ham sabhi maang karte hai ki unka vetan badhaayaa jaae
 '' saath hi kejariwal ne yah bhi kah daalaa ‘‘kal ko obama mili to kya bolenge
 This (modi's salary) should be at least 8-10 lakhs

 25 janvari ko relies hone vaali is film ke vishay par puure desh main viraadh jari he
 Recently, a conversation with senior actor Nana Patekar regarding this film is going viral on youtube
 jab unase poocha gaya ki supreme court ne film kii relies par hari jhandi de di he lekin jis tarah kaa virodh ho rahaa he
 In such a situation, is it difficult to make a historical film in today's time? SC rejects all the petition related to Padmavat ban, now if the film will be released in the whole country, people will definitely react, in response to this question, Nana Patekar said that someone Even the thing is not difficult
 filmon par bavaal hona aam baat he
 When the movie gets a green signal from the sensor, it will release
 haalanki sahi vishay par film banaaen
 If you make the right film, people will not react
 aap galat film banaaenge to log riect jarur karenge
 Keep in mind on the subject of the film, there was never any controversy in my film, i made films like Krantivir, despite having a bold statement, there was never any ruckus on them
 jaruri he is baat ko yaad rakhana ki aap film kya sochakar bana rahe hai
 Do you want to cash the subject or do you really want to give a strong message to the society
 tumhaare andar kitni sachai he wo ankhon main dikhaai de jaati he
 He said on the protest against Padmavati that the CBFC certificate Bhansali screened without saying Prasoon Joshi
 vahiin bhansaali doosraa varjan de rahe hai
 One thing is certain that the release of the film is necessary
 6 maheene main taiyaar hue padmavat ke costum, ek-ek kaam par hue researchitihaas se chhedhkhani karnaa galatamedia ne sawaal kiya ki cinema koi text book nahin he jis par aap roak lagaae
 This Nana Patekar has clearly said that the protest is wrong, but if they tamper with history, then it is natural for the people associated with it to feel bad
 film banaate vakt mekars kii jimmedaari hoti he ki kisi ko thes nahin pahunche
 Nana Patekar, who reached the screening of Marathi film Apal Manush, said that let the film release, you will know whether it is good or nonsense

 The Government of India is engaged in a work that has never been done before
 sarkaar pataa laga rahi he ki videsh yatra ke dauraan videshi media main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko kis tarah dekha gaya, iske liye videshi akhabaaron or channelon main modi par hui kawarej par nigaraanee rakhi ja rahi he
 The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting of India is carrying out this work
 videshi media main chhapi reporton ke anusaarashabdon kii ginati ke maamle main piem modiphilhal purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh se aage dikh rahe hai
 During the first visit of PM Modi to America in September 2014, 27,639 words were written in 31 articles in international media about his programs
 vahiin 2009 main jab manmohan singh america gaye the to 8 lekhon main 7,596 shabd hi likhe gaye the
 When Barack Obama came to India as the chief guest at the Republic Day Parade in January 2015 at the invitation of PM Modi, the top 10 news channels covered him for 255 hours, while in 2010 when he came to India under the UPA regime, the coverage was only 82 hours Had been
 doordarshan ne bhi 2015 kii obama yatra ko 33 ghante 45 minute cover kiya, jabaki 2010 main unki yatra ko usne keval 5 ghante 49 minute die the
 These figures are in the reports of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
 mantralayamodi kii videsh yatraaon par bhartiya or videshi mediaki pratikriya par najar rakh rahaa he or unki tulana manmohan singh kii yatraaon se kar rahaa he

 3 percent rural households and 96
 2 fisad shahari gharon main shauchalay he
 But Prime Minister Narendra Modi has claimed that India has become free from open defecation
 to sawaal uthta he ki gramin bharat main baaki ke 28
 In the report titled 'drinking Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Housing Conditions' where 7 percent people go to the toilet? Those involved in the sample were told that they expected to get government toilets, so there was every possibility of bias
 50
 9 percent in rural areas and 49
 9 fisad shahari ilaakon main flush kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The NSSO report also states that 51 percent of rural and 49 percent of urban areas have household toilets connected to septic tanks
 lekin septic tanks kii kshamta or unki digaayan ko lekar bhi sawaal uthte rahe hai
 Several such reports have come out which suggest that septic tanks start to overflow within a few months
 survey ke dauraan gramin ilaakon main 4
 5 percent homes and 2 in urban areas
 1 fisad gharon main latreen ke aasapaas pani kaa strot maujuud nahin tha
 This is also a big reason why people go to open defecation even after the toilet is built
 is report kii sabase khaas baat yah he ki isamen jab logon se yah poocha gaya ki ve shauchalay ghar main hote hue bhi iskaa istemaal kyon nahin karte? jawaab tha, pani kii killat
 3 because of water crisis
 5 fisad gramin ilaakon or 1
 7 percent of people in urban areas do not use it even after having toilets

 When Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar once again formed the government with the BJP, it was believed that at least in Bihar, external leaders of BJP will get less opportunity to campaign, but it seems that BJP now trusts Nitish Kumar as much Is no more yahi kaaran he ki brihaspativaar ko uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath booth str ke kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karne ke liye punia pahunche
 Here he praised Nitish Kumar's work as Chief Minister and described him as a popular Chief Minister
 yogi adityanath ne BJP ke booth str ke kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki bihar jangal raaj se baahar ja chukaa he
 Earlier, the youth were in trouble and hiding their identity when they went somewhere
 ab nitish kumaar ke shashan kaal main ve apane aap par garv mahasoos karte hai or baahar jane par kahata hai ki ve bihar ke nivasee hai
 On this occasion, Yogi Adityanath also invited people to come to Kumbh and said that now they have to come to Prayagraj, not Allahabad
 ve din gaye jab log faijabad jate the
 Now they have to go to the city of Ayodhya
 yogi ne daawa kiya ki is varsh ke kumbh main janvari se paanch farvari tak hi kareeb record 14 karod logon ne sangam main snaan kiya he
 In fact, bjp's strategy is that in the two Lok Sabha constituencies of the four Lok Sabha constituencies where it will contest, there is little chance of winning one of its candidates unless there is communal polarization
 isliye vah chaahati he ki yaa to yogi jamkar prachaar karen yaa unke jaise dhruvikaran karaane vaale netaaon ko vahaan sakriy kar diya jaae
 He therefore believes that a party more effective than Chief Minister Nitish Kumar considers Yogi Adityanath

 What is ASEAN On August 8, 1967, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand together formed the Group of Southeast Asian Nations, that is, ASEAN, although it was not expected then that this institution would soon establish its own special identity
 ab tak asian ke 31 shikhar sammelan ho chuke hai
 The main objective of this 10-member organization was to increase economy, politics, security, culture and regional cooperation in the Southeast Asia region

 On the other hand, America also wants to maintain its bullying in the region with the help of India so that China cannot take advantage of its unilateral position in the region
 bharat or america samudri raste se swatantra rup se vyapaar kii baat karte rahe hai
 If China strengthens its hold in the region, it will increase the chances of India's trade being affected
 isliye uskaa asian se jude rahanaa na sirf jaruri he balki use is sanghathan ke saamne isse judi samasyaon ko rakhana bhi chahie
 Media reports show that China has a considerable hold in ASEAN and also interferes greatly
 yahi kaaran he ki dakshin china sagar ko lekar asian main mudda nahin ban paata
 ASEAN countries do not even dare to go against China
 samrik sthiti majboot karne ke kaaran china or america ne is sanghathan main dakhal diya or is kaaran yah itnaa mahatvapurn hota chalaa gaya

 unhone mana ki pichley varshon main purvottar kshetra ke vikaas par apekshit dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 He said that there is a plan in the Ministry of Home Affairs to rehabilitate the surrendered rebels
 iske alaava grih mantralay ke tahat aane vaale ardhsainik balon kii do nai bataliyanon main purvottar kshetra ke logon kii bhartee kii jaaegi

 Emphasizing on better relations with neighboring countries, Singh said that by inviting the heads of all neighboring countries to the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, our government had indicated in the beginning that we want a good relationship with them
 
 is silsile main unhone purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke us bayaan kaa ullekh kiya ki 'aap apane mitra badal sakate hai, padesi nahin
 Referring to the objection of Congress members to the 'congress-free' slogan of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Singh said that it meant creating a 'congress-free government' and no other meaning should be seen in it
 unhone kaha ki hamaara desh bahudaleey loktantr he or yahaan congress sahit sabhi raajnneetik partiyon kaa astitv bana rahanaa chahie
 Rajnath said that his party does not do politics only to form government
 ‘ham samaaj banane kii raajnneeti karte hai
 Vote bank politics is the reason for deteriorating the environment of the society
 ’ unhone kaha ki sarkaar desh main sampradayik sauhaard ko har haal main barkaraar rakhana chaahati he
 The government wants to follow the path of justice and human beings and wants to provide livelihood, bread, security and respect to every citizen
 rajyapalon kii niyukti ke mudde par unhone kaha ki samvidhan ke anusaar inaki niyukti ke pehle sambandhit rajya ke mukhyamantri se paraamarsh karnaa padataa he
 However, their consent is not required for this
 unhone kaha ki is sarkaar ne har rajyapal kii niyukti se pehle sambandhit mukhyamantri se baatcheet kar unhen sambhavit naamon ke bare main avgat kara diya tha
 Referring to the security system in Delhi, he said that the government has taken various steps in this regard and in the coming time 8,000 CCTV cameras will be installed
 abhi aise camaron kii sankhya kareeb 3,000 he
 He denied that the government had tapped a minister's phone
 supreme court se ek acchhee shuruyaat ho rahi he
 This time, 15 out of 28 judges will hear three important cases during the summer holidays
 iske liye teen teen jajon kii bench banaai gai he
 Along with triple talaq, polygamy as well as the right to privacy of whatsapp, Facebook will also be heard
 ek or maamla he
 Hearing will also be held in the matter of giving citizenship to the children of the illegals who have come illegally
 yah bhi acha he
 It is better to have a hearing for years, so that some important cases are completed during the holidays
 faisla ho jaae to or bhi acha
 On 24 April 2016, Prime Minister Modi had requested for leave in the judges' meeting that it should be thought otherwise or the court time will never be extended
 ham sab is baat ke aadi hote ja rahe hai ki adaalaton main jajon kii sankhya kam he, varshon tak sunwaayee hi chalati rahati he
 An institution has studied why there is a delay
 vidhi centre for legal policy naam kii sanstha ne adhyayan kiya he
 For this, 8,086 orders related to 1,129 cases of Delhi High Court have been studied
 sample ke taur par in adeshon kaa chunaav 2011-15 ke bich daayar 2,02,595 maamalon main se kiya gaya he
 Of these, 1,22,245 cases have been divided into eight categories and sampled
 sunwaayee se lekar faisle tak pahunchane main deree ke kaarnon kaa pataa lagane kii koshish kii gai he
 We often understand the question of judicial delay at the level of perception itself
 kyon deree hoti he iske kaarnon par kam charchaa hoti he
 Was the delay due to the non-attendance of the judge, or did the lawyer repeatedly take the adjournment order without reason, or did the lawyer not appear, or the court really has so many cases that the time spent on each case should have been more Is not the same
 vidhi legal centre ne pataa lagane kii koshish kii he ki sabase adhik deree kis kaaran se hoti he
 Adjournment is due to a stay order
 adjarnment sabase bada kaaran niklaa he
 In 91% of the cases where delay has been made, there is a reason for adjustment
 70 fisadi cese main to teen teen baar adjarnment ke kaaran deree hui he
 Emergence also has different reasons
 july 2016 main supreme court ke justise deepak mishra or justise nariman ne trial court ko chetavanee di thi ki aderjanment ek virus ke samaan he
 There is a need to curb this
 gayatri banaam em girish maamle main supreme court ke in do jajon ne kaha ki jo gavaah he use saat baar court main bulaayaa gaya, gavaah aayaa bhi lekin vakil ne baar-baar adjarnment maanga or use diya bhi gaya
 After this, both the judges of the Supreme Court write in different places in their decision that, 'we have to say here that the trial judges were some illusions because something else was going on in the mind of the defense and the petitioner
 court adjarnment detaa rahaa
 The defense also did not interrogate the witness and kept taking the next date
 ek bujurg aadmi ko gavaahi dene ke liye itani baar court main aane main kya dikkat pesh ai hogi, isaki kalpana kii ja sakati he
 The trial court adjourned the issue till 3 October 2015
 us din bhi gavaah court aayaa lekin bachaav paksh or yachikakarta ke vakil hi court nahin aae
 The court again adjudicated the matter
 aderjanment maang kar is cese main jaanboojh kar deree kii gai
 All the cases that are held in the court are called pending before the court
 chaahe wo do maheene puraane hon yaa do saal
 But the legal institution has tried to see that in the cases where the decision was taken, for what reasons it was delayed, if it was not delayed, what decision could have come sooner
 maamalon ko nipataane main dilli hai court kaa record bahut acha mana jaataa he
 76% of all the cases filed between 2011-15 were settled by 2015
 inamen se 60 fisadi cese chah maheene ke bheetar nipta diye gaye
 This record of Delhi High Court sounds fantastic, but can the same be said about other courts
 sanyog se shuukravaar ko vakeelon ne hadtaal bhi kii he
 He is opposed to some of the Law Commission's suggestions
 tippaniyan The Law Commission has suggested amendments to the Advocate Act so that they do not go on strike
 agar hadtaal par gaye to apane muvakkil ko harjaana dena hoga
 It also defines the professional behavior of lawyers
 agar kisi vakil par missconduct ke aarope sabit ho gaye to unka license radd ho saktaa he
 For example, in a case they did not work properly, they were negligent, they bargained with someone, then it would now be considered inappropriate behavior
 vakeelon kaa kahana he ki yah suzav unke virodh karne ke adhikaar ke khilaaf he
 There is also a provision for fine of three to five lakhs on lawyers
 agar ve apane muvakkil se galat vyavhaar karte paae gaye to
 If the lawyer does not come to work, then your client will have to pay damages
 to kyon hoti he sunwaayee se lekar faisle main deree
 Who is responsible for this and how can it be rectified? iske liye dilli hai court ke 1,129 maamalon se jude 8,086 adeshon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he
 As a sample, these orders have been selected out of 2,02,595 cases filed between 2011-15
 inamen se 1,22,245 cese ko aath shreniyon main baant kar unka sample liya gaya he
 Attempts have been made to find out the reasons behind the delay in hearing from the verdict
 nyaayik deree ke sawaal ko aksar ham dharna ke str par hi samajhate hai
 The reasons why there is delay are less discussed
 kya jaj sahab kii gair haaziri ke kaaran deree hui, yaa vakil sahab ne baar-baar akaaran sthagan aadesh le liya, yaa vakil hi haazir nahin hue, yaa adaalat ke paas vaaki itane maamle hote hai ki har cese par jinata samay dena chahie utana hota hi nahin he
 The Law Legal Center has tried to find out what causes the most delays
 adjarnment yani sthagan aadesh ke kaaran hoti he
 Adjournment is the biggest reason
 91 fisadi jin maamalon main deree hui he unamem adrgement ek kaaran to he hi
 In 70 per cent cases, there have been delays due to adjuncts thrice
 aderjanment ke bhi alag-alag kaaran hote hai
 In July 2016, Justice Deepak Mishra and Justice Nariman of the Supreme Court warned the trial court that the adulteration is similar to a virus
 is par ankush lagane kii zarurat he
 In Gayatri vs m Girish case, these two judges of the Supreme Court said that the witness who was called seven times was called in the court, the witness came but the lawyer repeatedly asked for the award and was given it
 iske baad supreme court ke donon jaj apane faisle main alag-alag jagahon par likhte hai ki, 'hame yahaan par kahana padegaa ki jo trial jaj the, wo kisi bhram the kyonki bachaav paksh or yachikakarta ke dimaag main kuch or hi chal rahaa tha
 The court continued to adjudicate
 bachaav paksh ne gavaah se bhi poochtacha nahin kii or agali taarikh lete rahe
 It can be imagined that an elderly man could face such difficulty in coming to court so many times to testify
 trial court ne is masale ko 3 oktober 2015 tak sthagit kar diya
 That day also the witness came to the court but the defense and the counsel for the petitioner did not come to court
 court ne phir se matter ko adjarn kar diya
 The case was deliberately delayed by seeking an advertisement
 adaalat main jitne bhi maamle honte hai wo court ke saamne pending hi kahe jate hai
 Whether it is two months old or two years old
 lekin vidhi sanstha ne yah dekhne kaa prayaas kiya he ki jin maamalon main faisla aayaa, unamem kin kin kaarnon se deree hui, agar wo deree na hoti to kya faisla or jaldi aa saktaa tha
 The Delhi High Court has a very good record in disposing of cases
 2011-15 ke bich jitne bhi cese file hue hai unka 76 fisadi hissaa 2015 tak nipta diya gaya
 Of these, 60 per cent of the cases were settled within six months
 dilli hoicourt kaa yah record to shandaar lagata he lekin kya duusari adaalaton ke bare main bhi aisa kaha ja saktaa he
 Incidentally, the lawyers have also gone on strike on Friday
 lau kamishan ke kuch sujhaavon ko lekar unka virodh he
 The comments lau kamishan ne edwocket act main sanshodhan kaa suzav diya he taaki ve hadtaal na kar saken
 If you go on strike, your client will have to pay damages
 isamen vakeelon ke peshewar vyavhaar ko bhi paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 If a lawyer is convicted of misconduct charges, his license can be canceled
 jaise kisi cese main unhone thik se mehnat nahin kii, laaparvaahee kii, kisi se saudebaazi kar lee, to ise ab anuchit vyavhaar mana jayega
 Lawyers say this suggestion is against their right to protest
 vakeelon par teen se paanch lakh ke jurmaane kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 If they were found to be misbehaving with their client
 agar vakil kaam par nahin aae to apane muvakkil ko harjaana dena hoga
 So why is there delay in hearing to verdict
 iske zimmedaar koun hai or kaise ise thik kiya ja saktaa he? We often understand the question of judicial delay at the level of perception itself
 kyon deree hoti he iske kaarnon par kam charchaa hoti he
 Was the delay due to the non-attendance of the judge, or did the lawyer repeatedly take the adjournment order without reason, or did the lawyer not appear, or the court really has so many cases that the time spent on each case should have been more Is not the same
 vidhi legal centre ne pataa lagane kii koshish kii he ki sabase adhik deree kis kaaran se hoti he
 Adjournment is due to a stay order
 adjarnment sabase bada kaaran niklaa he
 In 91% of the cases where delay has been made, there is a reason for adjustment
 70 fisadi cese main to teen teen baar adjarnment ke kaaran deree hui he
 Emergence also has different reasons
 july 2016 main supreme court ke justise deepak mishra or justise nariman ne trial court ko chetavanee di thi ki aderjanment ek virus ke samaan he
 There is a need to curb this
 gayatri banaam em girish maamle main supreme court ke in do jajon ne kaha ki jo gavaah he use saat baar court main bulaayaa gaya, gavaah aayaa bhi lekin vakil ne baar-baar adjarnment maanga or use diya bhi gaya
 After this, both the judges of the Supreme Court write in different places in their decision that, 'we have to say here that the trial judges were some illusions because something else was going on in the mind of the defense and the petitioner
 court adjarnment detaa rahaa
 The defense also did not interrogate the witness and kept taking the next date
 ek bujurg aadmi ko gavaahi dene ke liye itani baar court main aane main kya dikkat pesh ai hogi, isaki kalpana kii ja sakati he
 The trial court adjourned the issue till 3 October 2015
 us din bhi gavaah court aayaa lekin bachaav paksh or yachikakarta ke vakil hi court nahin aae
 The court again adjudicated the matter
 aderjanment maang kar is cese main jaanboojh kar deree kii gai
 All the cases that are held in the court are called pending before the court
 chaahe wo do maheene puraane hon yaa do saal
 But the legal institution has tried to see that in the cases where the decision was taken, for what reasons it was delayed, if it was not delayed, what decision could have come sooner
 maamalon ko nipataane main dilli hai court kaa record bahut acha mana jaataa he
 76% of all the cases filed between 2011-15 were settled by 2015
 inamen se 60 fisadi cese chah maheene ke bheetar nipta diye gaye
 This record of Delhi High Court sounds fantastic, but can the same be said about other courts
 sanyog se shuukravaar ko vakeelon ne hadtaal bhi kii he
 He is opposed to some of the Law Commission's suggestions
 tippaniyan The Law Commission has suggested amendments to the Advocate Act so that they do not go on strike
 agar hadtaal par gaye to apane muvakkil ko harjaana dena hoga
 It also defines the professional behavior of lawyers
 agar kisi vakil par missconduct ke aarope sabit ho gaye to unka license radd ho saktaa he
 For example, in a case they did not work properly, they were negligent, they bargained with someone, then it would now be considered inappropriate behavior
 vakeelon kaa kahana he ki yah suzav unke virodh karne ke adhikaar ke khilaaf he
 There is also a provision for fine of three to five lakhs on lawyers
 agar ve apane muvakkil se galat vyavhaar karte paae gaye to
 If the lawyer does not come to work, then your client will have to pay damages
 to kyon hoti he sunwaayee se lekar faisle main deree

 Jaiswal said that some newspapers have said that coal is available for short-term production at some power plants
 darasal, aisi sthiti aavantit kshamta se adhik utpaadan tathaa kai anya kaarnon se utpann hoti he
 Coal India should not be blamed for this

 Hearing on the IPL-6 spot fixingcase, a Delhi court on Monday questioned the police theory of 'match fixing' saying there was no prima facie evidence to show that the arrested accused had fixed the matches
 atirikt satr nyaayadhish nina bansal krishna ne police se kaha ki aap telephone par hui jis baatcheet (giraftaar aropiyon ke bich) kaa zikr kar rahe hai vah bilkul yah nahin jaahir karti ki usamenmatch phixingka koi put he
 It is only associated with betting
 match phixing ke bare main koi sanket nahin he
 The judge, while hearing the arguments on framing of charges, asked Special Public Prosecutor Rajiv Mohan, "is betting a crime in itself?" Replying to the court's question, Mohan said, "betting is illegal by itself but it is not a crime
 ’ is par nyaayadhish ne kaha, ‘kis praavdhaan ke tahat, sattebaaji avaidh he? kisi faujadaari kanoon ke tahat sattebaaji ek avaidh gatividhi he?’ abhiyojak ne jawaab diya, ‘yah divaani kanoon main avaidh gativadhi he or faujadaari kanoon main nahin
 During the debate on the question of framing the charges, Mohan cited telephone conversations between the accused and said that they were involved in match fixing and betting
 unhone bataaya ki kol detail record saaf taur par aropiyon ke bich sambandh ko jaahir karata he jo paisa kamaane ke aapraadhik giroh kaa hissaa the
 To this, the court said, "what you are saying may be 100 percent true but please show me the evidence

 china ke raashtrapati shi jinping ab 2023 main ritair nahin honge
 The Communist Party of China has taken an initiative in the Constitution to abolish the obligation of the President and the Vice President for only two years of five years
 sansad se paarit hone ke baad shi jinping china ke itihaas main maao tse tung ke baad china ke sabase taqatvar netaa ke taur par duniya ke saamne honge
 However, this decision of the Chinese government will ignore the policy of the last three-four decades that did not allow centralization of power in the hands of any one person
 lihaaja, samvidhan main prastaavit is sanshodhan ke baad ek baar phir maao tse tung kii tarj par china main satta sirf or sirf shi jinping main kendrit ho jaaegi
 Why China had a two-term rule? In 1982, in view of the excesses of the Chinese government during Mao Tse Tung's tenure, Chinese President Deng Xiaoping decided to amend the constitution to limit the tenure of both the President and the Vice President
 yah kadam deng ne isliye uthaaya jisase desh main koi ek vyakti maao tse tung kii tarah taanashaah na banane paae
 Then why are these laws being changed? The Communist Party is making no mention of the threat of dictatorship in China with its decision
 haalanki mana ja rahaa he ki yah faisla raashtrapati shi jinping ke abtak ke kaarykaal kaa asar he
 Earlier, Xi Jinping has published his political ideology in the country's constitution during his tenure
 jinping se pehle mahaj maao tse tung ke raajnneetik vichaar samvidhan main chapa he
 Read this: With the strengthening of Jinping in China, this will increase the challenges of PM Modi
 Therefore, this decision can be said that Jinping is taking this step to increase his political stature in China
 iske alaava china ke raajnneetik khemen main yah dharna majboot he ki beete kaarykaal ke dauraan vishwa patal par china kii saakh majboot karne or bade aarthik sudhaaron ke saath desh ko aage badhaane kaa kaam sirf shi jinping kii aguai main sambhav he
 Will Xi Jinping be China's second Mao Tse Tung? This will be the second time in history after World War II when a president becomes the sole center of power and power
 maao ke china se samaj lete hue maujuuda samay main shi jinping kaa kaha koi bhi shabd desh kaa kanoon he
 Xi Jinping has also tried to bind the party, army and media on the basis of personal loyalty on the lines of Mao, due to which, once again after a gap of nearly 30 decades, all the powers in China are vested in them
 shi jinping ko khud kehete suna gaya he ki unki aarthik nitiyaan or gharelu nitiyon kaa prabhaav agle 50 varshon main apane sheersh hoga or inke sahare china duniya kii sabase badi shakti banane main kaamyaab hogi

 mujffarnagar se sainkadon kisaanon kaa jattha guuruuvaar ko muradanagar ke liye ravaanaa hua or police prashasan bhi unhen rokane main kaamyaab nahin ho sakaa
 It is worth noting that the angry farmers were unanimously announced that the water going from Muradnagar in Uttar Pradesh to Delhi will be stopped on Thursday, due to Chaudhary Charan Singh's decision to vacate the kothi
 police ne gussaye hue kisaanon ko rokane ke liye jagah jagah bairicating bhi kii lekin wo unhen rokane main asafal rahe
 The group of farmers went further towards Muradnagar
 bhartiya kisaan union pravaktaa rakesh tikait kaa safataur par kahana he ki jaise dilli 12 tughlaq road par choudhary charan singh kii kothi se vahaan kii sarkaar ne pani kaata he, vaise hi muradanagar gang nahar se dilli kaa pani kaat diya jayega
 He said that now going to Muradnagar canal, it will be talked with the officials and the government because that Kothi in Delhi is the heritage of farmers

 nato helicopteron ne afghanistan ke ek pramukh hotel par dhaava bolne vaale taliban ke bandookdhaari ladaakon par raaket daage jabaki paanch ghante tak chali muthbhed main sabhi nau hamalavar samet 21 log maare gaye
 Officials said all gunmen were killed in an overnight operation at the inter-continental Hotel
 san 1960 ke dashak ke is sarkaar hotel main jab aatankwaadiyon ne hamalaa kiya tab yahaan afgaan suraksha sammelan chal rahaa tha or ek badi shaadi party chal rahi thi
 The hotel is not part of the global Inter Continental chain
 grahamantralay ne kaha he ki is aatankwaadi hamale main nau afgaan naagarik or do police adhikari maare jabaki 18 anya ghayal ho gaye
 Afghan citizens are mostly hotel workers
 mantralay ke anusaar maare gaye naunve taliban aatankwaadi kii pahchaan ho gayi he
 The Ministry of Home Affairs and the Government of Spain in Madrid say one of its citizens was also killed in the hotel, who was allegedly a pilot in a Turkish airline
 grahamantralay ke pravaktaa seddic seddiqui ne bataaya aatankwaadi hamale main maare gaye hotel ke karmchaaree us samay hotel ke pehle tal or lobby main the jab taliban hamlaawaron ne hamalaa hua
 Those staying at the hotel were officials of the provincial government and foreign security forces came to Kabul for a conference on handing over security to Afghan security forces
 desh ke raksha vibhaag ne kaha ki is karrwai main afgaan commando kii sahaayta karne vaale newjiland ke vishesh bal ke do sainikon ko maamuli chotein aayi hai
 According to police, the attackers did not go through the road leading to the hotel where there is tight security
 unhone uttari dhalaan se pedo ke jhuramut vaale sthaan se mangalvaar kii raat 11 baje hotel par dhaava bolaa
 Major Tim James, spokesman for noto's International Security Assistance Force, reported that the ISAF deployed a helicopter at the request of Afghan officials
 unhone bataaya, ‘is helicopter ne kai baar hotel ke upar chakkar lagaaya or aatmghaatee jacket pahane hamalaavaron kii pahchaan kii jo apane hathiyaaron se las hokar hamalaa kar rahe the
 He then clashed with them
 ’ james ne kaha, ‘hamen khabar mili he ki kuch visphot bhi kiye gaye
 The explosion may have been caused by the militants flying themselves or the suicide jackets of the militants when attacked by helicopter
 ’pratyakshdarshiyon ke anusaar nato kaa helicopter apache ladaaku helicopter tha
 Ejazullah, a hotel worker, said that when the firing started after the late night attack, he hid in a room on the fifth floor
 usne kaha, ‘pehle goliyaan chalin or phir do visphot hue
 Then the bullets were fired continuously
 main jis kamare main chipa tha vah dhuen se bhar gaya tha
 'he said,' i had to leave
 jab main baahar aayaa to chaaron taraf khun ke dhabbe najar aa rahe the, usee bich police aayi or vah mujhe bhawan se baahar le gayi
 Meanwhile, Taliban spokesman Zabibullah Mujahid said that he was behind the attack
 hamale ke baad kabul main sthit anya hotalon kii suraksha bhi badha di gai
 The US State Department said, "the US strongly condemns the attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabalu, proving once again that the terrorists do not care about human life
" ’taliban ke hamalaavaron kaa yah hamalaa rajdhani kabul main ab tak kaa sabase bada hamalaa tha
 With this attack, the Taliban probably wanted to show that it is capable of conducting attacks at the center of power at a time when the United States is making statements about progress in the war that lasted almost 10 years
 america raashtrapati baraak obama ne pichley hi hafte afghanistan se america sainikon kii vaapasi kii ghoshnaa kii thi or kaha tha ki kabul praant ke zyaadaatar ilaakon samet afghanistan ke anek ilaakon main suraksha kii jimmedaari afgaanon ko supurd kar di jaaegi
 The attack came less than a week after the announcement by the Taliban
 kai ghanton tak sangharsh ke baad nato helicopteron ne takreeban teen baje tadke paanch manjila hotel kii imaarat kii chat par hamalaa kiya jahaan ugravadiyon ne morcha sambhaal rakhaa tha
 However, the Taliban attack was deflected hours later when a suicide bomber hiding in a hotel room exploded and blew himself up
 yah hotel main aakhri dhamaakaa tha jo mritkon or ghayalon ko ambulinceon main le jaae jane ke kai ghante baad hua
 Latifulla Mashal, a spokesman for the Afghan National Security Directorate, said suicide bombers either blew themselves up or died at the hands of Afghan or coalition forces
 rajdhani main ek sammelan main hissaa lene aae helmond praant ke khufia pramukh najar ali vaahidi ne bataaya, ‘hamaara cameraa kai goliyon kii chapet main aayaa
 We stayed in our room all night
 ’ ek photographer ne karrwai ke baad kareeb pashchimi vishesh bal ke chah sainikon ko hotel se baahar nikalate hue dekha
 Due to the attack, the people present in the hotel got nervous and were asked to stay in their rooms
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki unhen ashanka he ki hamalavar aatmghaatee jacket, mashinagan or rocket se daage jane vaale grenade kadi suraksha jaanch se kisi tarah chhipaane main safal ho gaye honge
 James said, 'we have received reports that some explosions were also carried out
 ho saktaa he ki yah visphot ugravadiyon dwaara khud ko udaane se hua ho yaa helicopter se hamale karne par ugravadiyon kii aatmghaatee jacketon main visphot hua ho
 a hotel employee, Ejazullah, said that when the firing started after the late night attack, he hid in a room on the fifth floor
 usne kaha, ‘pehle goliyaan chalin or phir do visphot hue
 Then the bullets were fired continuously
 main jis kamare main chipa tha vah dhuen se bhar gaya tha
 'security of other hotels in Kabul was also increased after this attack
 america ke videsh vibhaag ne kaha, ‘america kabalu main sthit interkantinental hotel par hamale kii kadi ninda karata he jisase ek baar phir sabit hota he ki aatankwaadiyon ko maanav jivan kii koi parvaah nahin he
 ' dhadakanen roak dene vaale pehle semifinal main south africa ko haraa kar newjiland world cap ke final me pahunch gai he
 Now File Team India will play with New Zealand or Australia will decide on Thursday only
 magar satta bazaar final main pahunchane vaali duusari team kaa faisla abhi se kar chuki he
 What is that team? Team India or Australia? The world is now eyeing the second semi-final of the World Cup cricket to be played in Sydney on Thursday
 garaz ye ki is match main jahaan ek taraf par duniya kii number van van-de team austrailia he, vahiin duusari taraf dephending world champion team india
 With regard to this most high-profile match of the World Cup 2015, these divisions are not limited only to sportspersons and fans of cricket
 balki is khel par jurm kii us kaali duniya kii bhi hazaron jodi ankhen nigahen gadaaye baithi hai, jinhen duniya betting yaa sattebaazi ke naam se jaanati he
 According to a rough estimate, betting of more than Rs 5000 crores is estimated for the bookies in the same match between Team India and Host Australia, which has been the Center for Attraction since the beginning
 jo ab tak kisi bhi match main sattebaazi ke itihaas main sabase badi rakam maani ja rahi he
 The small punters who earn and lose thousands on every ball, along with the billionaire businessmen who run the betting syndicate, are waiting for the match
 satta bazaar se jude sutron par yakeen karen to is match ke liye bazaar ne austrailia ke haq main jo bhav kholaa he, wo 50-52 kaa he
 It is clear that if a punter puts one rupee in favor of Australia, then he is sure to get a profit of 50 rupees if Australia wins, while the bidding in favor of India is going to yield 52 rupees as per the desired result
 sattebaazi kii duniya kaa ye ganit hi ye bataane ke liye kaafii he ki world cap cricket ke is duusare semifinal match main betting kii duniya austrailia ko fevorett maan kar chal rahi he
 It is another matter that since this match is a thorn, there is only a difference of two rupees in the price
 kehane kaa matlab ye ki is match main austrailia beshak fevorett he, sattebaazi kii duniya india ko bhi kuch kam nahin aank rahi
 Since this is the biggest match of this World Cup so far, bookies can change their attitude not just before or after the match, but also for every ball, total score, wickets, first ten balls and even power
 The bets are also set to play on the results of the play
 sidney main guuruuvaar ko toss ke saath hi online satte kaa jo silsilaa shuru hoga, wo match ke aakiri gend tak chalata rahegaa
 This math of a bet, which runs from a thousand rupees, also has its own rules and rules
 vaise to sattebaajon ke mutabik puraa satta online hi chalegaa, lekin online betting ke is khel ke bich is baar satta bazaar jin do khilaadiyon par sabase zyaada daanv khel saktaa he, unamem viraat kohli or glen maxwell kaa naam sabase upar he
 This is to say that on every ball from the toss to the slog overs, this time the speculative market has made full preparations to move crores of rupees
 vaise satta to bharat or bangladesh ke khilaaf khele gaye quarter final mukaable main bhi laga tha, lekin tab bhav 16 or 18 kaa tha
 Team India was undoubtedly a favorite in this match, but given the track record of this World Cup in Bangladesh, the bookies also kept it in the race
 world cap par 50 karod kaa sattajis toornament kaa ek match 5 hazaar karod kaa ho, us puure toornament kii qeemat agar 50 hazaar karod rupye tak pahunch jaae, to hairaani nahin ho chahie
 Thinking about such a huge amount may seem strange, but the amount of money spent on the eleventh World Cup cricket in the speculative market is a record in itself
 isaki ek badi vajah is baar ranon kii barish bhi he
 If it did not, then the International Cricket Council would not have spent more than a hundred times more than the amount spent for organizing this World Cup, only in the sports betting running on this event
 aap yakeen karen yaa naa karen, lekin sattebaazi kii duniya kii khabar rakhane vaale log jaanate hai ki is toornament main puri duniya main is baar kareeb 50 hazaar karod rupye kaa satta khelaa ja rahaa he
 This amount is more than a hundred times the amount that the ICC is spending in organizing this eleventh World Cup
 balki sach to ye he ki pichley world cap ke mukaable sattebaazi kii ye rakam bad kar do gune se bhi zyaada ho gai he
 That is, where the world cup was estimated to be worth 20 thousand crores of rupees on the last time, this time this figure has also crossed 50 thousand
 world cap main 26 taarikh ko hone vaale india austrailia ke match main sirf haar-jeet par hi daanv nahin lagane vaala he, balki har gend, har ran, har wicket, har kaich or yahaan tak ki no or wide ball tak par lakhon-karodon rupye idhar se udhar honevaale hai
 In addition, bookies are playing bets on the weather, toss and even the personal performance of the players
 yani kul mila kar sau overon vaale ek vanade match main phenki jane vaali tamaam 600 gendon par noton kii barsaat ho rahi he
 This is the reason that cricket is the most profitable business for the speculative market and speculators keep taking big risk for it
 munish devgan or nitin jain, ajtak Criticizing Modi, UK leader and economist Meghnad Desai, who was an admirer of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has said that Modi is not a player to take the team along
 niraash matadaata unhen dobaaraa bahunt nahin dilaaegaa
 Desai said that Modi made more promises and he made the mistake of believing that instead of having a strong cabinet, he would be able to govern the entire country with the help of some bureaucrats as he had done when he was the chief minister in Gujarat
 desai ne guuruuvaar ko pitiai se kaha ki baharhaal log niraash hai
 There is a feeling that the good days have not come yet
 landan main bas chuke desai ne kaha ki modi ke paas bade avasar the
 He also said that not taking the team along can prove fatal for them
 desai ne kaha ki modi achche netaa to hai lekin team ko saath lekar chalane vaale achche khilaadi nahin hai, vah team ke netaa nahin hai
 He is a mass leader, but not a team leader
 unke mantrimandal main arun jetali or sushamaa swaraj ko chhod kar koi bhi anbhavi nahin he
 In contrast, Pranab Mukherjee, Arjun Singh, Sharad Pawar and P
S
, in the UPA regime led by Manmohan Singh, say Desai
 chidambaram sahit kam se kam 6 mantriyon ke paas pradhanmantri pad kii yogyata thi
 He said that Modi did not anticipate that things would get so difficult and that the situation would become such that he would have to request the public once again to bring him to power

 pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi (shah Mehmood Qureshi) ne kartarpur galiyara (kartarpur Corridor)khole jane ke din ayodhya maamle (ayodhya Verdict)main aae faisle par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki vah is tarah ke khushi ke maukey par dikhaae gai ‘asamvedansheeltaa' se behad dukhi hai
 Significantly, the Indian Supreme Court on Saturday paved the way for the construction of a temple at the disputed site Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya and directed the Central Government to allot five acres of land for the construction of the mosque to the Sunni Waqf Board

 The dispute had set the country's social fabric apart
 ‘don news tivi' ne kuraishi ke hawaale se kaha, ‘‘ kya isko thode din taala nahin ja saktaa tha? main is khushi ke maukey par dikhaae gai ‘asamvedansheeltaa' se behad dukhi hum
 Referring to the much awaited opening of the Kartarpur corridor, he said, "you should have been a part of this joyous occasion rather than diverting attention from it
" yah vivaad samvedansheel tha or use is shubh din kaa hissaa nahin bananaa chahie tha
 "this corridor connects Baba Nanak Gurdwara in Gurdaspur to Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, Pakistan
" yahaan guru nanak dev ne apane jivan ke antim varsh bitaye the
 Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib is located near the Ravi River in Pakistan and is about four kilometers from the Dera Baba Nanak Gurdwara in Gurdaspur district of Punjab
 is saal 12 november ko guru nanak kii 550veen jayanti ke jashn ke hisse ke rup main ise kholaa gaya he
 Pakistan's foreign minister said that Muslims "are already under a lot of pressure in India" and this decision of the Indian court will add more pressure to them
 '' kuraishi ne kaha ki pakistan faisle ko vistaar se padhane ke baad is par apni pratikriya degaa
 Meanwhile, Pakistan's Science and Technology Minister Fawad Hussain called the decision "shameful, inappropriate, illegal and immoral"
 sarkari pakistani radio kii ek khabar ke anusaar soochna or prasaaran maamalon main pradhanmantri kii vishesh sahaayak firdaus evan ne faisle par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki bhartiya sheersh adaalat ne bataa diya ki vah swatantra nahin he
 He said that on one hand, Pakistan is ensuring the rights of minorities by opening the Kartarpur corridor, on the other hand India is oppressing minorities including Muslims

 com / ukmhklmw6u —india Today (@indiatoday) November 19, 2019 On the question of students living in the university for old age, the former president of JNU Students' Union said that it is wrong to question age, whoever PHD will take 30 years
 agar ye gunaah to 33 saal main piem MA kare to vaahvahee kyon he
 Kanhaiya Kumar said that if any country wants to establish relations with other countries, then it needs international study, JNU is the only university where this facility is available
 har baar miltaa he best uniwarsity kaa awordvirodhiyon par nishaanaa sadhate hue kanhaiya kumaar bole ki agar JNU kharaab he to har saal ise best uniwarsity kaa aword kyon mil rahaa he, yahaan ke padhe hue log nobel jeet rahe hai or modi sarkaar main mantri hai
 No student of JNU supports nonsense slogans like 'bharat tere pieces'
 fees badhotaree par kanhaiya ne kaha ki kuch log sirf ek baat kaa udhaaharan bana puri uniwarsity ko tabah karnaa chaahate hai
 Today there are 40 out of 100 students in the university who cannot study with increased fees, no one is asking for anything in a bailout, but has passed the test
 agar is tarah fees badi to ye desh kii sabase mahangi uniwarsity ban jaaegi
 Political analyst Raghav Awasthi said on the controversy that the government is not afraid of the students of JNU, these people constantly oppose the BJP
 unhone kaha ki desh kii janata poochna chaahati he ki tex par padhane vaale kyon chaahate hai ki fees naa badhaai jaae
 He questioned what the country would benefit by studying South Africa

 Manish said that on the Uri attack, the representatives of the government were saying that we will answer the tooth with a jaw
 ye kehete kehete wo is par pahunch gaye ki ham saarc summit main hissaa nahin lenge
 Manish Tiwari asked what decision the government wants to take on the Indus Water Agreement? Because the dam is not built in a day
 ye to ek lanbaa upaay he to phir abhi kya karegi sarkaar? dekhiye ye jo sabase pasandida mulk kaa darja he pakistan kaa usko jald se jald radd karnaa chahie
 Congress spokesperson said that if the government really wants to change the attitude of Pakistan, then India needs to think of concrete measures
 dakshin asia sabase kam integrated he badi badi chunauti hai isliye soch samaj kar faisla len
 If the government feels that Pakistan is isolated, then i think that the government is living in the world of its thoughts
 asaliyat to ye he ki sarkaar ko jo lakva padaa he usase rose kshati pahunch rahi he

 hameshaa senarendra modiko nishane par rakhane vaale kendriya mantrishashi tharurne is baar gujarat main ho rahe kaam kii tarif kii he
 Tharoor tweeted that as an Indian, when Gujarat does a better job, i feel proud, just as proud for Kerala
 tharur ne yah twitgujarat tourism ko teen neshnal tourism awordamilane ke baad kiya
 However, Shashi Tharoor once again tried to compare Gujarat with Kerala
 gujarat ko sarvshereshth paryaton film, soochna or praudyogiki ke abhinav istemaal or deshbhar main paryaton ke vyapak vikaas ke liye aword hasil kiya he
 Responding to this, Shashi Tharoor tweeted that i am proud of it
 modi raaj kii aalochana karte rahe hai tharuris baar kendriya mantri shashi tharur ne beshak gujarat kii dhamak ko sweekaar kiya he, lekin ve isse pehle akasar gujarat kii modi sarkaar ko nishaanaa banaate rahe hai
 On March 7 this month, Shashi Tharoor tweeted, it is good to hear that Ahmedabad has developed through a 30-year-long process, clearly it cannot be the work of a chief minister
 is twit main unhone sidhe-sidhe narendra modi ke un daavon par hamalaa kiya, jinamein ahmedabad ke vikaas ke liye hameshaa modi sarkaar kii peeth thapthapai jaati rahi he
 After this, Tharoor in a tweet presented some wrong figures of progress in Kerala
 unhone likhaa, ve sab gaur karen, jo kehete hai ki kerala peeche rah gaya he: kerala ne 2011-12 main 9
 Has progressed at the rate of 5 percent
 sab rajya isi tarah badhen, isaki dua karte hai
 Kerala 9
 5 pratishat kii dar se 2010-11 main unnati kii thi, jabaki tharur ne bataaya ki yah dar 2011-12 kii he
 He later beheaded this mistake of a member of Kerala
 gujarat kerala se ageshashi tharur gujarat kii tulana akasar kerala se karte hai
 But if government figures are to be believed, Gujarat is ahead of Kerala in terms of development
 2004-05 se 2011-12 tak kerala kii vikaas dar 8
 In the same time period, Gujarat has scored 52 percent
 08 pratishat kii dar se vikaas kiya he
 National and State 8
 28 pratishat he
 Gujarat also surpasses Kerala in per capita income
 2001 main jab gujarat kii prati vyakti aay 17,226 rupee thi, tab kerala kii prati vyakti aay 19,854 rupee thi
 After ten years, the per capita income of Gujarat in 2010-11 is Rs 52,708, while Kerala has Rs 49,873
 imployament and an-imployament survey 2011-12 ke aankade bataate hai ki gujarat main 1000 logon par 10 log berozegaar hai
 At the same time 99 people are unemployed in Kerala at a thousand people

 The revelations about Aaj Tak's 'pitch fixing' ahead of the Pune ODI between India and New Zealand have stirred the cricket world
 BCCI ke kaaryvahak sachiv amitabh choudhary ne kaha he ki is khulaase ke baad match hoga yaa nahin is par ICC kaa match referi vichaar karegaa

 Amitabh said that he is not yet aware of the whole matter, but it will be dealt with strictly
 amitabh choudhary ne kaha ki maine is mudde par maharashtra cricket association ke adhyaksh se baat kii he
 He said that Pandurang should not be allowed to go on the field after this
 saurav ganguli bole- jo hua galat huapurv captain saurav ganguli ne bhi is khulaase ke mudde par ajtak se baat kii
 Sourav said that he has not seen this sting completely yet, first i will take full information
 lekin agar aisa hua he to kaaphi galat he
 Bhajji said - This shameful act
 Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh said on the revelation that this is shameful, such people should be kept away from cricket
 aise logon kii vajah se cricket par dhabba laga he, ye sirf unka nahin ham sabakaa phelior he
 What did the pitch curator say on camera? In 'aaj Tak', Pune's pitch curator Pandurang Salgaonkar revealed confidential information about the preparation of the pitch to the camera
 bataa den ki buudhvaar ko bharat or newjiland ke bich pune main hi match khelaa janaa he
 The reporter asked the pitch curator for some changes to the pitch for his two players, to which Pandurang agreed at once
 pich curator ne kaha ki jo pich hamane taiyaar kii he, usapar 337 ranon tak kaa score ho saktaa he
 Which can be easily chased
 reporter ke kehane par pandurang use pich dikhaane ko bhi raji ho gaye, jabaki niyam ke anusaar pich par captain or coach ke alaava match se pehle koi nahin ja saktaa he
 At the same time, the pitch curator said that he can change the mood of the pitch within a few minutes
 unhone pich par keel vaale juute pahanakar jane kii bhi ijaajat di
 BCCI official Rajiv Shukla had a special conversation on the revelations made by the curator regarding the pitch of the Pune match, before the India New Zealand match to be held in Bolepune
 pich ko lekar kiye sthaneey curator ke khulaase par aaj tak ke sting par rajeev shukla kaa kahana he ki 'BCCI kaa rukh in tamaam muddon par bahut khadaa he
 BCCI takes action on such things when it comes to light
 'rajeev shukla ne kaha, 'amitabh choudhary kaa bayaan bhi aa gaya he ham is par karrwai karenge
 We have a conversation with the Chief of Anti Corruption Unit

 Took notice of this, it is being investigated
 abhi match referi ke upar hai ki usee peach main match karwaanaa he yaa duusari pich par karwaanaa he
 When the match is canceled, Rajiv Shukla says that the match cannot be canceled
 zyada se zyada yah vah dekhenge ki agar is bich main koi gadabad hui he gadabadi hui he to vah duusari bich main match karvaa sakate hai to wicket badal sakate hai kyonki ek ground bhi kai wicket hoti he
 i don't think anyone else will be involved in this
 lekin jaanch ho rahi he
 The investigation has started, action will be taken on the basis of Anti Corruption Urine Report
 yah sara Action ICC kii anti karpshan unit kii jaanch ke baad hoga
 This will happen after the report arrives
 rajeev shukla kaa kahana he ki lekin puri tareeke se transleshan baratane kii baat kii gai he
 The BCCI secretary will execute it
 is match ke rigelt par koi fark nahin padegaa
 The hanging of Kulbhushan Jadhav has been banned by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands
 pakistan ko ab counslar acces bhi dena hoga
 Pakistan has been asked to review its decision and reconsider
 8 binduon par donon deshon ke bich matbhed tha
 At one point, all 16 judges voted, including the judges of Pakistan
 baaki saat binduon par 16 main 15 jajon ne bharat ke paksh main faisla diya he
 The judge of Pakistan voted against
 donon pakshon ke lagaae gaye aaropon ko sunne ke baad court ne silsilewar tareeke se aadesh diya he
 Not only has the execution of the sentence been banned, but Pakistan has been found wrong on many points
 jaise court ne pakistan ke is aarope ko khaarij kar diya ki bharat kulbhushan jadhav ke bhartiya hone kaa pramaan nahin de rahaa he
 The court said that both Pakistan and India consider Kulbhushan Jadhav as Indian, hence there is no need for proof
 court ne bharat ke bhi chaar main se teen agrahon ko thukraa diya
 India had demanded from the court that the decision of the Military Court of Pakistan be quashed
 pakistan ko aadesh diya jaae ki vah military court ke faisle ko radd kare or jadhav ko surakshit bharat bheje
 The court did not consider it
 lekin kai binduon par court ne pakistan ke ravaiyon or daleelon ko thukraayaa he
 The court said that Pakistan's allegation that India has misused the procedures by bringing the matter to international court
 isliye court bharat ke is aagrah ko khaarij kare
 The court did not accept it
 court ne yah bhi kaha ki pakistan ne jadhav kii giraftaar ke baad unke adhikaron kii jaankaree nahin di jo use karnaa chahie tha
 Not only this, India should have given information within three weeks of Jadhav's arrest
 pakistan ne aisa nahin kiya
 Pakistan has violated the rights by not giving counselor access
 is tarah court ne kaha ki pakistan kaa daayitv banataa he ki vah antarrashtriya maanakon ke anusaar jo galat kaam karata aa rahaa he wo na kare or jadhav ko uske adhikaron ke bare main jaankaree de
 It should not be delayed
 bharat ke counslar adhikari ko jadhav se milane diya jaae taaki ve jadhav ko kanoonee sahaayta uplabdh kara saken
 Prime Minister Modi has said that we welcome this decision
 satya or nyaay kii jeet hui he
 Congratulations to the ICJ for delivering a decision based on the facts
 mujhe bharosa he ki jadhav ko nyaay milegaa
 Our government will always work for the safety and welfare of all Indians
 purv videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne swaagat kiya he or pradhanmantri ko bhi badhai di he
 Advocate Harish Salve was fighting this case on behalf of India at a fee of one rupee
 8 may 2017 ko bharat ne international court of justise main yah mukadmaa daayar kiya tha
 On 18 May 2017, the court stayed the execution until the final verdict was made
 pakistan ne aadesh ko mana or faansee kii sazaa par roak laga di thi
 Pakistan's biggest argument was that Article 36 of the Vienna Convention would not apply to a person caught by spying
 bharat kii daleel thi ki vienna kanvation main kisi prakaar kii chhot nahin he
 The court said that India is not a party to the Law of Treaty of the 1969 Vienna Convention
 pakistan ne 1970 main hastakshar kiya tha magar ise lagu nahin kiya tha
 The court took its own meaning and rejected Pakistan's argument
 bharat ne is faisle ko badi jeet bataaya he
 Defense Minister Rajnath Singh has described it as a major victory for India
 purv videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne bhi kai twit kiye
 Congratulated Prime Minister Modi and described it as a major victory for India
 is cese ke liye sushamaa swaraj ne vakil harish salve ko bhi badhai di
 Salve was fighting this case at a fee of just one rupee
 faansee kii sazaa par roak lagi
 Kulbhushan will get counselor access and will also get legal assistance
 lekin is faisle kaa swaagat pakistan main bhi ho rahaa he
 Pakistan's media says that the International Court did not quash the decision of the Military Court
 faisle ke pej number 37 par paragraph 137 padhanaa chahie
 India asked the court to quash the decision of the military court
 ise civil court main hastantarit kare
 The court has not accepted
 sirf itnaa kaha he ki faansee ke faisle kii samiksha kii jaae
 The court has said that the Vienna Convention has been violated, the only way to cancel the judgment
 ashink rup se yaa purna rup se
 This means that if the Vienna Convention is violated, it will be reviewed
 ise bhi raahat mana janaa chahie
 In the 145th paragraph of the verdict, the judges wrote that Pakistan's lawyer had assured that Jadhav would get a free and fair trial
 yah pakistan ke samvidhan kii buniyaad he
 Judicial decisions are reviewed
 iske liye pakistan ne 2018 ke peshawar hoicourt ke faisle kaa hawala diya ki kai buniyadi maamalon main military court ke faisle main dakhal diya ja saktaa he
 The first is when there is no evidence, the second, the evidence is not sufficient, the third military court has gone out of its jurisdiction and the fourth law and misinterpretation of facts
 in chaar maamalon main hoicourt military court ke faisle ko palat saktaa he
 The International Court of Justice stated in its judgment that in the case of review or reconsideration of any decision, the principles of free and fair trial have to be respected
 court maanata he ki punirvichaar or samiksha ke dauraan jadhav ke adhikaron ke ulanghan ke maamalon par vichaar hoga or use dur kiya jayega
 Paragraph 146 of page number 39 also states that it will be up to Pakistan which method of review and reconsideration of the verdict it adopts
 samiksha or punarvichaar kai tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he
 It is not as if the freedom of choice of choice is arbitrarily found
 kulbhushan yadav ko march 2016 main pakistan ne jasusi ke aarope main giraftaar kiya tha
 India never accepted it
 ek saal baad pakistan kii sainik adaalat ne faansee kii sazaa suna di
 Pakistan said that its army had arrested Jadhav from Balochistan
 jadhav iran se pakistan main ghusane kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 India says Jadhav was abducted from Iran
 jadhav nausena se ritair hone ke baad apane bijness ke liye gaye the
 In February, there was a hearing in this case around the Pulwama terror attack
 bharat ne aarope lagaaya tha ki jadhav ko mohara banaaya ja rahaa he taaki vah aatank ke samarthan ke aarope se batch sake
 The name of India China is getting very flashy that the judge of China also voted
 isse ham apni hi kamyaabi ko halkaa kar dete hai
 Underlining the name of China separately, it seems that the judges have given their verdict based on international diplomacy
 jabaki yah faisla antarrashtriya kanoon or parampara ke aadhaar par diya gaya he
 India has achieved this victory on the basis of its best legal preparations within the court
 16 jajon main bharat or pakistan ke bhi jaj the
 The judge of Pakistan voted differently
 ganimat he koi china kii tarah bharat kaa naam is tarah se nahin le rahaa he ki bharat ke jaj ne bharat ke paksh main vot kiya
 Apart from China, 16 judges included Somalia, Slovakia, France Morocco, Brazil, USA, Italy, Uganda, Jamaica, Australia, Russia, Lebanon, Japan
 in sabakaa naam bhi aadar se liya jaae
 Justice is good anywhere, from India to anywhere in the world
 aaj kii khushi main yah baat bhi shaamil he
 The copy of the judgment is the same
 wo internet ke zarie bharat main bhi uplabdh he or pakistan main bhi
 But the news of both countries emphasizes different things
 jaise don news ne apni hedline main likhaa he ki isije ne jadhav ko waapas karne kii bharat kii maang thukraa di lekin counslar acces de diya
 But inside the news, there has been written a ban on hanging
 express tribune ne likhaa he ki isije ne jadhav ko bari karne or waapas bhejne kii maang thukraa di
 Pakistan insists that India's demand has been turned down, on the other hand, there is the headline of India's newspaper Hindu that the court asked Pakistan to review the punishment
 indian express ne likhaa he ki court ne bharat ko counslar exces diya, pakistan se kaha ki faansee kii samiksha kare
 Pakistan's official response to this decision has not come
 aaj pakistan main mumbai hamale kaa master mind hafiz said giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Pakistan's Counter Terror Department arrested Hafiz Saeed and was produced in the Anti Terrorism Court
 jail bhej diya gaya he
 Hafiz Saeed's organization is accused of financial assistance in terrorist activities
 pakistan ke is faisle kaa amareeki raashtrapati trump ne swaagat kiya he
 It has been said in its tweet that '10 years after the Mumbai attack, the so-called master mind Hafiz Saeed has been arrested in Pakistan
 ise khojane ke liye do saalon se dabaav banaaya gaya tha
 'how to explain it
 trump pakistan par apane dabaav kii baat kar rahe hai yaa bharat kii jeet bataa rahe hai yaa phir pakistan in kadamon se phir se america ke kareeb janaa chahta he
 Or does America want to come close to Pakistan again
 bahut si daleelein hai
 Just remind you that in March 2019, the UN rejected Hafiz Saeed's appeal that his name be removed from the list of banned organizations
 lekin tab pakistan ne hafiz said kaa bachaav nahin kiya tha
 In May 2019, the United Nations put Masood Azhar in the Global Terrorist List
 disambar 2008 main sanyukt raashtra kii suraksha parishad ne mumbai hamale ke baad hafiz said kaa naam atanrarashtriya aatankiyon kii suchi main daal diya tha
