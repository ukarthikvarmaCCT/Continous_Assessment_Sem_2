 Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa has reportedly suggested a list of names of some people who will replace him
 yediurppa ne yah suchi aise samay main suzaayi he jab bhaajapa kendriya netritv kii ore se yah spasht kar diya gaya ki vah party kii pradesh ikai kaa bhi netritv nahin karenge
 Party sources said the option for the Chief Minister was still open and negotiations were going on with central observers Arun Jaitley, Rajnath Singh and Yeddyurappa camp for this
 yediurppa ne spasht rup se kendriya netritv ko bataa diya he ki vah apana tyaagptr kal saunp denge
 He has suggested some names and said that if he is selected from the list of suggested names, he will not protest
 mukhyamantri pad ke liye daud main kanoon evam nyaay mantri suresh kumaar es, udipi se saansad evam karnataka bhaajapa ikai ke adhyaksh sadanand gauda or ucch shiksha mantri ve es acharya shaamil hai
 Kumar is said to be a leader with a clean image and is also close to the Sangh
 yadhyapi unhen kaddavar netaa nahin mana jaataa
 Along with this, he is a Brahmin by caste
 is jati kii rajya main sankhya bahut adhik nahin he
 The party central leadership has two votes regarding Gowda
 unhen madhuraswabhaav kaa mana jaataa he isliye mana jaataa he ki virodhiyon kii aawaaj ko dabaane main safal nahin honge
 Few people in the party are proud that he will not prove to be a skilled administrator
 sutron kaa kahana he ki jati se brahman acharya party main kaaphi logon ko sweekaar he lekin mukhyamantri kii daud main vah pichad rahe hai
 Some in the party suggested the name of Shoba Karandlaje, close to Yeddyurappa, but the Chief Minister himself was not interested in him
 isliye unka naam chhod diya gaya
 This is seen as a softening of the attitude of the Chief Minister
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki uttaradhikaar ke mudde par yediurppa ke vafaadaar jin kuch mantriyon or vidhayakon ne apni raay dene ke liye kendriya netaaon se milane se inkaar kar diya tha, unhone ab apana man badal diya he
 The Chief Minister's camp had yesterday claimed the support of 74 mlas
 aisa samajha ja rahaa he ki yah sankhya ab kam ho gai he
 Home and Transport Minister r Ashok said, 'those who were in the Chief Minister's camp yesterday have now come here
 aapane unhen dekha he
 'ashoka is considered to be of the anti-yeddyurappa camp
 sutron ne bataaya ki party ke kendriya netritv ne yediurppa ko spasht kar diya he ki chunki rajya main koun aglaa mukhyamantri hoga isamen unki baat chalegi isliye vah khud party kii pradesh ikai kaa adhyaksh banane kii maang ko chhod denge
 This would mean that Eshwarappa would continue to be the state president of the party
 yediurppa ke kareebi sutron ne bataaya ki unhone rajyapal hansraj bharadwaj se aparaahn ek baje ke baad mulaakaat kaa samay maanga he
 According to the astrological calendar at that time, the ominous clock will end

 aisi party ke loksabhaa main bhi kam se kam chaar saansad hone chahie
 Also, there should be at least two percent of the total Lok Sabha seats and its candidates should come from at least three states

 The surprising thing is that the name of Vinod Tawde, Prakash Mehta and Eknath Khadse is also not included in the third list of Maharashtra BJP
 bijepi abhi tak maharashtra kii kul 143 siton par vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye apane ummidavaaron ke naam kaa elaan kar chuki he

 maharashtra ke gatchiroli main ek ke baad ek bade anti-naksal oparation se naksaliyon main khalabali machi hui he
 In these two encounters, the Central Committee of Naxalites is in a position to kill 22 Naxalites
 ab naksali gatchiroli se bhagkar surakshit thikaanon kii talash main chhattisgarh kii sarhad main daakhil hone kii taiyaari main hai
 However, here too the police and central security forces have started their siege
 chhattisgarh or maharashtra kii sarhad main hai alert jari hone ke baad chhattisgarh ke anti-naksal squad ne naksaliyon se apil kii he ki ve hathiyaar chhodkar baatcheet kii manch par aaen
 Otherwise, be prepared to die
 rajya ke DGP anti-naksal oparation dm avasthi ne naksaliyon se kaha he ki agar ve hathiyaar chhodkar baatcheet ke liye saamne aaenge, to police un par goli nahin chalaaegi
 The success of the police and central security forces on the outskirts of Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra has led to Naxalite infighting
 vahiin, gatchiroli main ek ke baad ek doenti-naksal oparationamen 22 se zyada naksaliyon ke maare jane se suraksha balon ke hausale buland he
 This anti-naxal operation has had a direct impact on the Naxal cadre
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki gatchiroli main karyrat ek darjan se zyada naksali dal chhattisgarh ke bijapur, bhopal patanam or narayanpur ke jangalon main daakhil hone kii taiyaari main he
 Usually, Naxalites flee to each other's states after carrying out major incidents so that they can escape from the police and central security forces
 haalanki is baar gatchiroli main hue lagaataar do encounter se naksaliyon main khalabali machi hui he
 They are now traveling towards Chhattisgarh in search of safe havens
 haalanki yahaan bhi police or kendriya suraksha balon ne unki gheraabandi shuru kar di he
 In the jungles of the outskirts of Chhattisgarh adjoining Maharashtra, security forces have started a strong barricade of Naxalites

 These jawans have been told that if any naxalitean asks for surrender, he should be safely taken into his possession
 varanaa goli kaa jawaab goli se diya jaae
 The Chhattisgarh Police has clearly told the Naxalites that the avenues of dialogue are still open
 barsharte naksali or unke netaa hathiyaar chhod saamne aaen
 According to the state's DGP anti-naxal operation DM Awasthi, the government is ready to negotiate with the Naxalites, but the Naxalites first stop the violence and put up arms
 unke mutabik ek ore naksali hinsa karen or duusari ore baatcheet
 
 
 
 aise main kaam nahin chalegaa
 He said that the solution to this problem can be solved by negotiation, then we are also ready for it, but negotiation is not possible without putting up arms
 chhattisgarh ke bastar ke aadha darjan jilon main naksaliyon ne aam janata hi nahin, balki police or kendriya suraksha balon par hamale tej kiye hai
 In the last three months, the Naxalites have left no stone unturned to fire the vehicles connected with the road construction, as well as the vehicles connected with the road construction
 sukama, dantewada, bijapur, kanker, narayanpur, kondagaanv or gariyaaband main naksaliyon ne aam logon ko bhi jaan-maal kaa jabardast nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 In many areas of these districts, normal life has also been badly affected due to Naxalite fear
 naksaliyon ne graminon ko hi nahin, balki police or kendriya suraksha balon ke javaanon ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya he
 Although on many fronts, police and central security forces are also heavy on the Naxalites, but the initiative of the police to directly interact with the Naxals amid this bloodshed can prove to be a milestone in the elimination of Naxalism
 chhattisgarh main mukhya vipakshi dal congress samet tamaam rajnatik dal bhi naksaliyon se baatcheet ke raste ko sadha hua kadam bataa rahe hai
 At present, no initiative has been taken by the Naxalites regarding the talks
 rajya main naksaliyon se sahanbhuti rakhane vaale kai sanghathan or buddhijivi bhi maujuud he, lekin is maamle main unhone ne bhi chuppi sadhi hui he

 Unlike his party's stance, Shatrughan Sinha said that he agreed with the Press Council of India President Markandey Katju's statement that Sanjay should be forgiven on humanitarian grounds
 sinha ne kaha, "main yah nahin kah rahaa ki use maaf kar do or na hi main nyaayalay ke faisle ke virodh main hum
 i respect the law of the country
 haalanki, meraa vinamr nivedan he ki sanjay ne jo sajaa kaati he, vah uske liye paryaapt he
 He is not a terrorist, his crime is only that he was caught in a bad company

 But he is a noble person

 He said, "sanjay is very close to me

 It may be noted that last week, the Supreme Court sentenced Sanjay Dutt, convicted in 1993 Mumbai bombings, to five years imprisonment
 nyaayalay ne unhen chaar hafton ke bheetar aatmasamarpan karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 The special TADA court of CBI held Sanjay guilty of possessing an illegal 9mm pistol and an AK-56 rifle under the Arms Act
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne haalanki sanjay dutt ko thodi raahat dete hue unki chah saal kii sajaa ko ek saal kam kar diya he
 This means that he will go to jail for three years and six months
 dutt 18 maheene kii sajaa pehle hi kaat chuke hai
 Asked why she should be softened with Sanjay, while many people died in this attack, Sinha said, "sanjay is a part of my life
 vah mere adarsh sunil dutt sahab kaa betaa he
 After all, why don't i join them? If we look at Sanjay's public conduct in recent times, he has been working continuously for humanism and his film 'lage Raho Munnabhai' is considered to be an inspiration for world peace and humanity

 However, he said that Japan is the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack and that the "philosophy of non-proliferation" should be reflected in the agreement

 Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told reporters after a program at the Islamabad Foreign Office Training Academy that mutual cooperation and dialogue is the only way forward
 isse donon desh labhanvit honge
 He said, "we have to talk to resolve all the issues
" ’’pakistan hathiyaaron kii hode main shaamil nahin hona chahtabharat dwaara apane pehle parmaanu pandubbi ‘ienes arihant’ kaa jalavataran kiye jane ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha, ‘‘pakistan kshetra main hathiyaaron kii pratispardhaa main shaamil nahin hona chahta lekin pakistan kii samrik kshamta ke kaaran santulan he
 "this balance gives a clear indication that war is not an option in the region and it would be a suicide attempt," he said
 ’’ unhone kaha ki yadhyapi pakistan ne parmaanu pandubbi ke jalavataran ko gambhirtha se liya he lekin ‘‘vah apni raksha jaruraton se puri tarah waakif he or use apni raksha shakti par puraa vishwaas he
 "there is no lack of will," Qureshi said, since talks are the only way and there is no lack of will among the leaders of India and Pakistan, so it is expected that the process of dialogue will be restored soon
 unhone kaha, ‘‘donon deshon ke netaaon ko baatcheet kii prakriya kii bahaali or uski safalataa ke liye satark or ashaavadi rukh apnaane kii jarurat he
 We can progress with a positive attitude
 ’’ Crowd's blind law
 insaaf ke naam par darindagi or haivaaniyat kaa khaufnak khel
 Even killing a human being just like yourself
 ji haa, desh ke alag-alag hisson main hinsak bheed kii aisi hi tasviren saamne aa rahi hai, jise dekhakar har kisi kaa dil saham jaae
 After all, what kind of mob system is there in a democracy
 bheed kii is jaanwaron jaisi maansikta par raashtrapati tak phikr jataa chuke hai
 The Prime Minister has also given advice
 lekin bheed kaa andhaa kanoon kaayam he
 The first incident is from Dumka district of Jharkhand
 yahaan jameen par besudh padaa ek shaks
 Dozens of women surround him
 gusse se bhadki mahilaon kii ye bheed jameen par pade shaks ko berahami se dhunati hai
 Most women have thick sticks in their hands, roasting a person lying on the ground
 shaks bhaag naa sake iske liye uske donon haath rassi se peeth kii ore baandh die gaye
 a rope was also tied at its foot
 isko jameen par ghasita gaya
 The reason for this anger of the mob is the charge against this man
 pitane vaale shaks par ek naaballig se rape or uski hatya karne kaa aarope lagaakar ramgarh thana ilaake ke logon ne isaki saraam is tarah pitayee kar di ki aaropee ne dam tod diya
 The police also got a sense of this rage of violent mob when this video went viral
 police ab is video ke jariye is shaks ko peetane waalon kii talash main jute gai he
 The crowd does not have any fear of the law, the accused was accused of life imprisonment and murder
 lekin is baat kii tasdik or phir ise sazaa dene kaa haq kanoon kaa tha
 The crowd became its own law
 jaj banakar faisla sunaane lagi
 The question is why this mob is not afraid of the law
 kanoon haath main lene kaa haq bheed ko kisne diya
 a terrifying picture has emerged of another area of jharkhand, where a man was killed
 bheed ne bivi ke hatyare ko maar dalaayah maamla jharkhand ke sahibganj ke rajmahal ilaake ke dakait tolaa gaanv kaa he
 Here the unruly mob accused a man of killing his wife and beat him to death
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki asaatul naamak shaks ne 4 saal pehle prem vivaah kiya tha
 After marriage, he started fighting with his wife
 5 din pehle hi donon main talaak hua tha
 But on Sunday night, the accused murdered his wife
 peet-peet kar sulaayaa maut kii neendisi baat se bhadki bheed ke andhe kanoon ne peet-peet kar is shaks ko maut kii sazaa de di
 The police have registered a murder case against the brother of the mob victim
 iske saath hi asaatul naam ke is shaks ko peet-peet kar maarane ke ilzaam main agyaat logon ke khilaaf bhi cese darj kar liya he
 It is being told that in the year 2014, Asatul married Marriage by the style of the village itself
 iskaa style ke bhai ne virodh kiya tha
 In Assam, the same blind law of mob in the name of beating the minor boys was also seen in Barpeta, Assam
 2 naaballig ladakon ko saream rusavaa kiya gaya
 Those boys had made some mistake, but the villagers themselves set up court
 ladakon ko saream peeta
 In the crowded crowd, children were lashed with sizzling thongs
 ikkaa-dukka logon ne rokane kii koshish jarur kii
 But only food was supplied
 in do naaballigon ko gaanvvaalon ne nashe kii haalat main pakadaa tha
 The villagers thrashed them fiercely for not taking drugs and teaching them a lesson
 iske baad inhen kasam bhi khilaai aage se nasha naa karne kii
 Intoxication is wrong and intoxication at a young age is fatal
 gaanvvaalon ne in ladakon ko ye baat samjaani chaahi
 There is no harm in this
 lekin bheedtantr ke is tareeke par sawaal jarur khadey hote hai
 After all, why the minor boys were beaten up in front of everyone is a big question
 ludhiana main duulhe par kiya hamalahavaan bane insaanon kii ek or ghatana punjab ke ludhiana se saamne ai he

 duulhe ko bhi talwaar markar jakhmi kar diya
 These CCTV photos of beach road fighting have come out from the Punjab city of Ludhiana
 chand naamak duulhaa saj-dhaj kar apni shaadi ke liye ja rahaa tha, lekin bheed uskaa bura haal kar diya

 film dil saalaa sanakee ki kahani he uttarapradesh ke jhaansi shahar ke ek yuva badal kii he
 He wants to be a goon like a domineering toddler babu since childhood as toddler babu is perky and a little stylish gangster
 baccha babu kii bhoomika main hai jimi shergill
 There is a love triangle in the film in which 2 Dabangas fall in love with the same girl
 donon hi sanakee hai, dabang hai, magar ladaai is baat kii he ki ek taraf baccha babu he to duusari taraf use bhagwaan maanane vaala chela badal
 The comments khaamiyon kii baat karen to film kii kahani uttarapradesh main basii zarur he magar parade par dekhte samay lagati nahin
 The language and accent there is not properly taken care of
 aisi filmon kii jaan hoti he vahaan kii sthaneey bhashaa, veshbhusha, lahaza or yahi sab is film se gaayab rahe
 The film stars Jimmy Shergill and Madalsa Sharma
 inke alaava baaki mukhya kalakaaron ke abhinay behad kamazor hai
 There is nothing new in the story either
 bas ek premika ke liye do logon kii sanak he
 i will get to see action and drama in the film which is seen in a masala film
 My rating for this film is 1

 Talking about the flaws, the story of the film is definitely based in Uttar Pradesh but it does not happen while looking at the screen
 vahaan kii bhashaa or lahaze kaa thik se dhyaan nahin rakhaa gaya he
 Such films are known for their local language, costumes, accents and all that is missing from this film
 is film main jimmy shergill or madalsa sharma ne acha abhinay kiya he
 Apart from these, the performances of the rest of the main cast are very weak
 kahani main bhi kuch nayaapan nahin he
 Two people are just a fad for a girlfriend
 film main ection or drama dekhne ko milegaa jo ek masala film main dekha jaataa he is film ke liye meri reating he 1

 The genie of the infamous Gujarat riots is once again looming over the head of Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 29 agast ko ahmedabad kii ek vishesh adaalat ne naroda paatia jansanhaar maamle main bijepi kii vidhayak or purv mahila evam bal vikaas mantri mayaben kodenani or bajrang dal ke netaa babu bajrangi samet kul 32 logon ko doshi tehraaya he
 Kodnani will have to spend 28 years in jail while Babu Bajrangi will remain in jail for life
 is hatyakand main 97 logon ko maar diya gaya tha or 33 log jakhmi hue the
 Kodnani is the first prominent face of the Sangh Parivar to be convicted in the Gujarat riots
 kodenani ke doshi sabit hone se peedit paksh ke vakil mukul sinha kii yah daleel sach sabit hui ki "dangon ko bhadakaane main sangh parivaar or sarkari tatwon kii sidhi bhoomika thi
 "30 others have been convicted in the case while the remaining 29 have been acquitted
 yah jansanhaar 28 farvari, 2002 ko hua tha jab 15,000 se 20,000 hindu dangaiyon kii bheed ne purvi ahmedabad ke bahari ilaake main karnatakai musalamaanon kii basti par hamalaa kiya tha
 Just a day before this, 59 Hindus were killed in the Godhra incident
 nyaayadhish jyotsna yaajik ne jab faisla padhakar sunaaya, to adaalat main maujuud peshey se doctor kodenani or unke pati ro pade
 This decision may create strategic problems for Modi in the run-up to the assembly elections
 yah faisla modi sarkaar ke liye nishchit hi afat ban kar aayaa he
 The decision came at a time when the Congress was busy campaigning in Gujarat and outside that Hindu rioters were instigated by the Modi government and the Sangh Parivar for their political interests
 rajya main vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) kii ikai kaa bhi ek bada dhada yah maanata he ki modi ne hinduon ke saath chal kiya he
 This is a face of the inner rift of the Sangh Parivar as the VHP is seen as anti-modi within Gujarat
 ummid ke mutabik kodenani ke vakil or bijepi netaa yatin ojha ne faisle par sawaal uthaae hai, "ek junior vakil tak is baat ko jaanata he ki unhen kuch activiston dwaara gadhe gaye sabooton ke aadhaar par doshi tehraaya gaya he
 What is more unusual in this case is that more than 50 per cent of the people convicted are the highest in the country as compared to the verdict given in any mob violence
 gujarat ke maamle main insaaf dilaane main jaldbaaji hui he, jabaki 1984 ke sikh virdohi dangon or 1992-93 ke mumbai dangon ke peediton ko ab tak insaaf kaa intjaar he
 "however, there is a wave of enthusiasm among Modi's opponents, led by social activist Teesta Setalvad
 unhone is faisle ko "sach ko patari se utaarne kii koshishon" ke khilaaf sach kii jeet qaraar diya he
 On the question of resignation, the state government has said that there is no reason to resign
 swasthya mantri jainarayan vyas ne kaha, "sarkaar main hone ke naate ham aam taur par adalati faislon par pratikriya nahin dete, lekin tathy yah he ki jab dange hue us vakt kodenani mantri nahin thim
 "vyas said," and if this is to happen, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot should have also resigned after the arrest of a Rajasthan minister in the Bhanwari Devi case
 "naroda paatia jansanhaar ke zyaadaatar peedit is baat se santusht the ki aakhirkaar insaaf mila, lekin saleem shaikh jaise logon kii raay duusari thi
 Sheikh, who had lost four of his family members in the riots, said, "29 more people left on the basis of evidence should have been convicted
" " ab tak gujarat dangon se jude mukademon main paanch faisle sunaae ja chuke hai
 The riot file was reopened by the team of Special Investigation Team (SIT) appointed by the Supreme Court in this case
 activiston ne gujarat police kii jaanch ko ghatiya bataakar esaity kaa gathan karavaaya tha
 But the allegations of social workers are taking quite an interesting turn in the light of facts
 masalan, chaar maamalon main doshi tehraae gaye adhiktar logon ko 2008 main shuru hui esaity kii jaanch se pehle hi gujarat police ne giraftaar kiya tha
 In the Naroda Patiya case, the SIT arrested only 11 of the 32 convicts, while the rest were already arrested
 sardarpura maamle main esaity dwaara giraftaar 21 main se sirf do ko doshi qaraar diya gaya he
 In other words, out of 31 people convicted in this case, the SIT has arrested only two

 The Congress, which has accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of doing politics in the name of Lord Ram and Krishna, is now engaged in the exercise of its confluence in Uttar Pradesh to try and strengthen itself

 The Congress, which was successful in winning less than 30 seats in the state, replaced Pramod Tiwari, the leader of the Legislature Party for years after the election, and made Pradeep Mathur, MLA from Mathura, a city in Krishna, the leader of the Legislature Party

 Congress leader in the Legislative Council Naseeb Pathan says the unexpected results once again in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, with the party strengthening in Uttar Pradesh from the confluence of Krishna and Ram as MLA Pradeep Mathur from Mathura and Faizabad MP Nirmal Khatri from Ayodhya

 The report said that if the people of India go to work by bicycle, then the country could benefit by 1800 billion rupees, which is 1 of the GDP of the country in 2015-16

 The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) research 'benefits of Cycling in India: Economic, Environmental and Social Assessment' (benefits of Cycling in India: An Economic, Environmental, and Social Assessment) predicted short distance travel For example, if a bicycle is used instead of two-wheeler or four-wheeler vehicles, then it could benefit Rs 1800 billion annually
 shuukravaar ko jari kiye gaye is shodh main yah bhi kaha gaya ki surakshit cycling ke liye avasanrachana (infrastructure) uplabdh karaane or cycling ke vibhinn phaaydon ko darshane ke liye jaagarukta abhiyaan chalaakar ye phaayde hasil kiye ja sakate hai
 At the same time it would be beneficial to eliminate the notion that bicycle is the medium of transport for poor people
 TERI and AICMA launched a report on Benefits of Cycling in India: An Economic, Environmental, and Social Assessment’ today
 As per the study shifting to cycling can result in an annual savings of up to 1
 6% of India's GDP

 The first author of this article met a young Indian driver during a visit to Sydney a few years ago
 vah dilli ke ek aise college se commers graduate tha jo daakhile kii behad oonchi cat-of ke liye khaasaa janaa-mana he
 It was natural to be curious about his position, as he seemed able to speak his words in a very fluent manner and was quite aware of the world around him
 jab usase poocha gaya ki vah sidney main cab kyon chalaa rahaa he, to vah noujvaan achaanak rone laga or subakte hue usne bataaya ki dilli ke college se degree lene main usne bekaar hi apana vakt jaaya kiya
 He had a painful feeling when his efforts to get employment in Sydney on the basis of his commerce background have repeatedly failed
 usase baar-baar kaha gaya ki vah vyaavhaarik yaa upyogi kuch nahin jaanata
 This condition continues year after year in this famous institution and almost half of the graduates who graduate from it fail to get employment during campus placements

 yah baat mujhe meri baaki kii jindagi salti rahegi
 i will leave from here in April 2015 and at that time my academic knowledge will be either the same or a little more than what was in July 2011 when i came to this institute

 We pay attention to the specific scenes of the entire history of other parts of the world and through them we explain our difference between knowledge and skill and the inter-dependence of different disciplines in the game of acquiring knowledge
 ham gahare samudron main nauvahan kar paane ke liye rapalgai kii ijad or istemaal kaa hawala dete hai
 This tool, invented and used centuries before the time of the chronometer, was so useful to our ships that sailed the seas that Hindustan had amassed tremendous wealth by sending its merchant ships on long-haul efficient and successful sea voyages
 
 rapalgai kii ijad vyaavhaarik jarurat kaa sidhaa nateeja thi, par yah gyaan kaa aisa utpaada bhi tha jise vyaavhaarik istemaal main laayaa ja saktaa tha
 It must never be forgotten that some of the great masons of history, whose teachings led to the creation of some truly great and new religions of the world, were closely associated with the roles that had to do with farming, carpentry and shepherding

 aisa nahin he ki hindustan ko sukhad taur par pataa na ho ki kya karne kii jarurat he
 We have had Mahatma like Tagore and Gandhi, who laid great emphasis on the use of hands and forging a relationship between knowledge and the real world

 Does this happen in higher education institutions in India? The answer is not emphatically! Even in famous institutions like IIT, this does not happen
 hamaare sabase jaruri or agrahi nuskhe desh ke vishvavidhyalayon or collejon ko lakshya karke tay kiye gaye hai
 Their learning programs are largely sharing so much knowledge through the blackboard, much of which is irrelevant and meaningless
 in sansthaanon ke graduate koi bhi hunar yaa hunar ko gyaan ke saath sarthak dhang se jodgaye kii kaabiliyat hasil karne main naakaam rahete hai
 For example, an important internal subject of mathematics, known as fluid dynamics, is taught in almost every reliable college mathematics course
 phir bhi iske chaatr hawaii jahaajon ke dizin main isaki bhoomika ke bare main mote taur par anjaan hi rahete hai
 Is it any wonder then that Hindustan does not go ahead in the construction of airplanes? There is an even more basic need, which is tremendous demand
 zyaadaatar sansthaanon ke chaatro main buniyadi sanchaar, vishleshan or ahm soch-vichaar ke hunar kii kami he
 Our experience shows that in most cases they are unable to think in true and pure ways
 isse pehle ki aap yah dharna banaaen ki unki yah naakabiliyat mote taur par angreji bhashaa se unki navakaphiyat kii vajah he, jaraa sanbhal jaaen! yahaan tak ki cou belt kahi jane vaali hindi pattee main bhi ye noujvaan, or yakeenan honhaar dimag ke noujvaan bhi, hindi jabaan main bhi upar bataae gaye hunar pradarshit nahin karte
 Now, their educational skills need to be fitted with this very important skill in them - that is, to acquire and analyze information and to desperately need to combine them with creative coding for a variety of uses
 Try it
 kya phir ham tajjub kar sakate hai ki ek bhi computer language hindustan main ijad nahin kii gai he? jab hamaare yuva dimaagon ko behad ahm soch-vichaar or vyaavhaarik gyaan ke anand or khoobiyon kaa swaad chakhne ko milegaa, keval tabhi ve apane taur-tareekon main hunar par aadhaarit gyaan hasil karne or uske phydemand istemaal ke liye vaaki nae or anuthe tareekon se kaam karenge

 aisi koi shaikshik sanstha bataaie jisane ek aisa credit system apanaaya ho jo is kism kii udhyamshiltaa par bhi jor detaa ho
 This duality or cleft must be eliminated between formal education and skill making
 to ve buniyadi hunar koun-se hai jo hamaare college or vishvavidhyalayon ko dene chahie or isamen sarkaar kii kya bhoomika ho sakati he?sabase jaruri or anivaary yah he ki sarkaar niamkeey yaa niyam-kaayade thopane vaale nikaayon ko jitani jaldi beasar kar de utana acha
 These institutions have to be free from the control and gripes of the imaginary bureaucracy
 tabhi college-vishvavidhyalay bahaduree ke saath nae-nae prayog kar paaenge taaki ve raashtra kii chunautiyon se nipatane ke liye jaruri gyaan or hunar ko aapas main jodgaye vaali nawachaari shiksha ko badhaava de paaenge
 As far as the skills are concerned, they are
 sanchaar or vishleshan kaa acha hunar, digital technology ke istemaal main maahir hona or soochna tathaa data ko behad ahm dhang se sanbhaalane kaa hunar
 It will have to be deeply integrated with the education of every subject and it will have to be taught in an inter-disciplinary way anyway
 yah koi rocket science nahin he or isliye is par amal bahut aasaan he

 The Reserve Bank on Wednesday relaxed some of the restrictions on gold imports
 kendriya bank ne kuch vyapaarik gharaanon ko sona aayaat kii anumati di he
 Earlier, the Reserve Bank has also allowed some banks to import gold
 kendriya bank ne yah kadam sone ke gahanon ke niryaat ko badhaava dene ke uddeshy se uthaaya he
 The Reserve Bank had in July last year imposed stringent restrictions on gold imports to control the rising import of gold and its adverse impact on the current account deficit

 Apart from this, there have also been cases of breaking the statues of Bhimrao Ambedkar, the creator of the Constitution, due to which there is a lot of anger among the Dalit community

 On Ambedkar Jayanti, all ministers of Modi government will visit different cities of the country and celebrate National Day of Justice

 ambedkar jayanti se paanch may tak khaas vishesh abhiyanbijepi 14 april (ambedkar jayanti) se paanch may tak gram swaraj abhiyaan chalaaegi, jiske tahat 18 april ko rashtriya swatchta diwas, 24 april ko panchayat raaj diwas, 30 april ko swasthya diwas, do may ko kisaan kalyaan diwas or paanch may ko rojgaar diwas ke rup main manaayegi
 If sources are to be believed, the BJP high command will soon talk to its Dalit MP Savitri Bai Phule from Bahraich
 iske saath hi anya naaraaz dalit saansadon kii naaraazgi ko dur karegi
 Meaning that PM Modi and Amit Shah know that if the damage due to SC / ST Act is not repaid in time, 2019 will be a far cry

 Bigg Boss is known for being unpredictable
 or yahi baaten darshakon ko apane televijan set se chipke rahane ke liye majaboor kar detii hai
 This time there is a tremendous twist in the story of Bigg Boss
 big bos kaa ghar shuru main jananath or jahannum do bhaagon main banta tha, use ab milaayaa ja rahaa he taaki ghar ke sabhi sadasyon ko jananath main aane kaa mauka mili
 For the past four weeks, members of the household living in Jannat and Jahnum used to walk according to the weekly transfers
 lekin ab se ghar ke sadasyon ko ek jaisi suvidhaayen or lagjri milegi
 However, the sudden change in events does not mean that the members will now have fun at Bigg Boss house
 pehle se behatar halaat vaali rahan-sahan kii dashaon ke saath jananath house main bed or baithne kaa sthaan pehle jitna hi rahegaa
 Hence it has become a cause of concern for the members
 philhal is ghar main sirf 10 sadasyon ke sone ke liye hi jagah he yani sirf 5 dabl bed hai
 So now the game is how the household members will ensure that each participant can sleep comfortably
 badalte maahaul or ghar ke sadasyon ke bich badalte rishton ke saath yah sabhi ke liye pariksha kii ghadi hogi ki kya ve ek chat ke neeche rah sakate hai
 Whatever it is, it will be interesting to see if the Jannat people who are living in Ash-o-ease will sacrifice some of their space and welcome their fellow Jahnumites
 aam aadmi party, punjab kii mahila wing ne dilli ke vidhayak devendra seharaavat par party or punjab kii mahilaon kaa apmaan karne kaa aarope lagaate hue punjab mahila ayog se unki shikaayat kii thi
 a few days ago, a delegation of women led by the party's Punjab Women Wing president Baljindra Kaur filed a written complaint against Punjab Women Commission chairperson Paramjit Kaur Landran, Delhi MLA Devendra Sehrawat
 saharaavat ke khilaaf kanoonee karrwai kii maangashikayat main kaha gaya tha kisaharaavat nekisi vyakti vishesh kaa naam na lekar unki party or puure punjab kii mahilaon ke charitra par prashnchinh laga diya he
 This is highly condemnable and unfortunate
 un sabane saharaavat ke khilaaf kanoonee karrwai kii maang kii thi
 On the basis of this complaint, the Commission had sent a notice from the Aam Aadmi Party to the suspended Devender Sehrawat on Wednesday, 14 September, to present his case
 saharaavat ne ayog ke saamne kaha- aarope sahisaharaavat ne ayog ke saamne pesh hone ke baad kaha ki jo aarope unhone pehle lagaae the un par wo abhi bhi kaayam hai
 He had said that common men and big leaders sent from Delhi to Punjab are exploiting women in Punjab in the name of giving tickets
 rojaanaa is tarah ke kai maamle saamne aa rahe hai
 If found security, Sehrawat Ayog Chairperson Paramjit Kaur said that Sehrawat has also taken the names of Sanjay Singh and Durgesh Pathak and said that he is ready to give all the evidence to the commission as well, provided the commission first arranges their security
 ayog nesaharaavat ke bayanrecord kar liye hai
 Now the investigation of the case can be handed over to the Punjab Police
 saath hi maamle main safai dene ke liye aam aadmi party ke netaa sanjay singh or durgesh pathak ko bhi ayog ke saamne bulaayaa ja saktaa he

 For England, Alex Hales had scored the most 37 from 26 balls, while Jason Roy contributed 21 runs from 20 balls
 england kaa anya koi bhi ballebaaj tikkar nahin khel paaya
 For Pakistan, Wahab Riaz took 3 wickets for 18 runs in 4 overs, while spinner Imad Wasim took two wickets for 17 runs in 4 overs
 pakistan kii ore se wahaab riyaj ne 4 over main 18 ran dekar 3 wicket liye, jabaki spinner imaad wasim ne 4 over main 17 ran dekar do wicket chatkaaye

 mccullum scored 47 off 27 balls and also joined the club of cricketers who hit 200 sixes
 grant iliyat or martin guptil ne ardhashatak lagaae lekin antim paanch wicket keval 14 gend main gir gaye or newjiland kii pari 46wein over main hi khatm ho gai
 Although Australian fielding was very poor
 kaich chode gaye or kai baar kshetrarakshakon ne missfield bhi kiye
 Sodhi became the 'man of the match' when Australia made a good start of the innings, so they thought they would win the match easily
 18
 94 runs were scored at the loss of 2 wickets in 3 overs
 or tabhi captain ko inderbir singh sodhi ne elbeadblyoo out kar diya
 Sodhi also drove the dangerous Maxwell on his next ball
 unhen slip main captain maikulam main lapka
 With this, the Australian team came under pressure
 apana kul 10waan oraustralia ke khilaafapahala vanade khel rahe sodhi ne bahut hi shandaar gendbaaji kii or unhone australian ballebaajon ko apni leg brake gendon se baandhe rakhaa
 He conceded only eight runs, taking the wickets of Smith and Maxwell in the first four overs
 haalanki iske baad jorge beli, marsh or hestings ne unhen sanbhal kar khelaa or antat match main sodhi kaa bowling figure 8-0-31-2 kaa rahaa
 Sodhi was adjudged 'man of the Match'
 ampire ke vivaadit nirnay se out hue marshyaha se kaman sanbhali mishael marsh ne unhone shuruyaat sanbhal kar kii pehle 20 gendon par keval 13 ran banaae or phir apane haath kholane shuru kiye
 Marsh had scored 41 off 38 balls, hitting two consecutive fours in the 26th over, two fours and sixes off two consecutive balls in the 30th over, and Australia seemed to be moving towards a safe target on their pitch
 lekin tabhi 34wein over main henry kii ek gend unke bat se lagane ke baad boot se lag kar waapas henry ke paas aa gai jise unhone safaltaapurvak lapak liya
 The New Zealand team, including Henry, felt that the ball had come after the pitch
 phir bhi henry ne aadhi adhuri apil kii lekin england ke ampire ian gould ne is par koi rispons nahin diya
 This was followed by an action replay shown on the big screen of the field, which the umpire referred to the third umpire

 He made an unbeaten start to the innings first and then rotated his bowlers in the best manner
 unke fielders ne bhi unka bakhubi saath diya, boland kaa ran out hona iskaa jeeta jaagta saboot tha
 Smith also settled the dispute by justifying Marsh's dismissal after the match

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has said that the post of Prime Minister is not his priority, but for him the party is at the top
 unhone kaha ki unka vishwaas lambii raajnneetik pari khilne main he
 He also claimed that he would change the party's picture in the next 10 years
 tippaniyan Amid a long-standing demand and speculation from Congress to declare Rahul as the Prime Ministerial candidate for the 2014 general elections, the party vice-president said during a conversation with party mps and journalists on Tuesday They believe in far-reaching politics and the party is their first priority
 ullekhneey he ki rahul gandhi ne isse pehle bhi congress ke netaaon se unhen (rahul ko) pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae jane sambandhi bayaanbaji karne se manaa kiya he, or mangalvaar ko bhi unhone kaha ki unka sara dhyaan party ko majboot banane kii ore he
 However, he did not comment on the question that if the party and the UPA alliance win the election for the third time, then who will be the Prime Minister
 rahul ko varsh 2014 main hone vaale aam chunaav ke liye congress kii ore se pradhanmantri pad kaa pratyaashee ghoshit kiye jane ke liye lambe arase se chal rahi maang or atakalon ke bich mangalvaar ko party saansadon or patrakaron se baatcheet ke dauraan party upaadhyaksh ne kaha ki vah doorgaami raajnneeti main yakeen karte hai or party hi unki pehali praathamikta he
 It is noteworthy that Rahul Gandhi has earlier also denied Congress leaders to make rhetoric about making him (rahul) the prime ministerial candidate, and on Tuesday also said that his focus is on strengthening the party
 haalanki unhone is prashn par koi tippanee nahin kii ki yadi party or upie gathbandhan teesri baar chunaav jeet jate hai to pradhanmantri kise banaaya jayega

 The NDA has decided its seats without any dispute, but it does not appear to be with the Grand Alliance
 siton kii sankhya ko lekar mahagathbandhan main shaamil partiyaan aar-paar kii ladaai ke liye taiyaar hai
 Congress does not want to contest less than 11 seats and RJD does not want to give it more than 8 seats
 hindustani avam morcha ke adhyaksh jeethanram maanjhi ko araspi se adhik siten chahie
 RLSP wants 5 seats
 viipi jaisi partiyaan bhi do-do siten chaah rahi hai
 In such a situation, RJD will not have more than 15-16 seats
 jabaki wo kam se kam 20 seat par ladanaa chaahati hai
 RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav also exposed this through tweets that the parties involved in the grand alliance should leave arrogance
 jabaki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa kahana he ki congress bady party he or wo iske rashtriya adhyaksh hai, to mahagathbandhan main shaamil partiyaan jail main jaakar siton kii talmail kii baat kyon kar rahi hai?upendra kushvaha congress kii taraf se gathbandhan main shaamil hue hai
 The Congress also wants to adjust Pappu Yadav and Anant Singh, but the RJD has reservations about these names
 lalu yadav kaa kahana he ki katihaar seat ko pichley chunaav main hamane ensipi ko di thi or ab tarik anwar ensipi main nahin hai, to phir wo kaise maan kar chal rahe hai ki wo congress ke tikat par vahaan se chunaav ladenge
 The Congress has gone ahead and announced to contest 11 seats in Bihar without consulting
 ensipi ke netaa deepi treepathi lalu yadav se mulaakaat kar vam dalon ko mahagathbandhan main shaamil karne kaa suzav diya he
 These are further complicating the knot of contradictory grand alliance
 aise main ab do hi vikalp saamne aa rahe hai
 
 
 
 
 1
 argedy congress ke liye paanch siten chhodkar baaki siton kaa elaan kar sakati he
 These seats are Aurangabad, Sasaram, Samastipur, Supaul and Kishanganj
 inamen se supaul or kishanganj siton par pichhali baar congress ne jeet darj kii thi
 2
 congress bhi taiyaar he ki agar 11 siton par baat nahin banati he, to vah ek alag gathbandhan banaakar chunaav lard sakati he

 The author of the book Kamal Senapati is Alok Mehta, the book has been published by topical publication
 aadhunik patrakarita ke yahaan tak aane kii puri kahani main kuch mahatvapurn kirdaar hai or in sabase ek saath baatcheet kerani ho to aapako kalam ke sipaahi kitaab jarur padhpsi hogi

 In this book of journalist Alok Mehta you will find interviews with many veterans like Dua, Rajendra Mathur, Manohar Shyam Joshi and Achuthanand Mishra
 iske saath mehta ne patrakarita ke chaar dashakon se zyada ke apane tajurbe bayaan kiye hai jo aapako raajnneeti or media ke sambandhon kaa ek pahalu dikhaate hai jahaan asahmatiyon kii paryaapt gunjaaish he, jaise- navabharat times ke tatkaaleen sampadak rajendra maathur ke nidhan ke bare main mehta kaa akalan
 Prabhash Joshi was editor of Jansatta newspaper during Mathur's time
 donon mitra the
 Alok Mehta said, "in the last few years, Prabhashji's visit to his house was a taboo
 prabhaash joshi or unke param priy kuch saathi maathur sahab ke bajaae prabhaash joshi ko hi bada safal sampadak maanate the
 Due to such internal wounds, sensitive Mathur Sahib left goodbye to this world only at the age of 56 due to accidental heart attack
 '' mehta ke is statement se pataa chalata he ki unka rajendra maathur se najdiki or prabhaash joshi se dur kaa naata tha
 Journalism is one of the stressing occupations
 hridayghaat kii kai vajahen ho sakati hai or jo is duniya main nahin hai, un par laanchhan lagaana saamaanya shishtachar kaa ulanghan he
 Not all generals are included in Kalam's commander
 alok mehta ko shaayad prabhaash joshi pasand nahin the isliye unhen shaamil nahin kiya gaya lekin roosi karanjia ke bagaiyr kitaab adhuri lagati he
 Karanjia has been the grand father of investigative journalism in India and without him the mention of any period of journalism will be incomplete
 sarkari vyavastha se loha lene vaale karanjia shaayad iklaute patrkaar rahe jinhen vyapak jansamarthan bhi miltaa tha
 They were also sent to jail and thousands of people were in their support while going to jail
 karanjia kaa nidhan 2008 main hua jabaki rajendra maathur ne 1991 main duniya ko alavida kaha
 Well, writing has its limitations, compulsions and perhaps because of this, injustice has been done at the hands of a veteran like Alok Mehta
 iske sabake baavjood is pustak main jo saakshaatkaar liye gaye hai unamem se kuch laajawab hai
 The experience of the famous journalist Saeed Naqvi, who took a four-hour interview with Fidel Castro, the Cuban ruler, is worth reading
 mehta ke sawaalon ke nakvi ne ekadam khulkar jawaab die hai
 The Beatles' visit to Mahesh Yogi and the presence of Naqvi there and Raghu Rai's arrival to take a picture together is a very interesting affair
 ye saakshaatkaar na sirf patrakarita main pravesh kar rahe logon ke liye balki bisiyon saal ke tajurbekaar logon ke liye bhi padhgaye laayak hai
 The story of Naqvi writing essays on mangoes during the test in journalism is also interesting
 iske alaava alok mehta ne nakvi se poocha he ki musalmaan ko sampadak kyon nahin banaaya jaataa, unhone iskaa bahut dilachasp or sateek jawaab diya he
 Many aspects of the media's relationship with the government, the relationship between the government's editors and the owners of media groups, the owners' editors and journalists have different aspects of different periods of time in different interviews of this book, so that the real picture of how the government and the system works is in front of you

 This book is very helpful in catching the nudge of media market because Mehta has left no stone unturned in asking questions

 The pace of digital transactions and digital banking declined after demonetisation
 uske baad rigerv bank dwaara kevaisi ko lekar sakhti barte jane ke baad digital banking kii raftaar thodi or sust hui he
 Experts say that due to the ever increasing fraud in digital transactions and banking, it is important to be careful
 digital kranti desh ke har kshetra main ai he
 Everything from social networking to Pita delivery and taxi booking is available digitally, but the digital revolution in the banking industry is not catching up that way
 bainkon kaa bijness model puraane jamaane kaa he or khaskar public sector ke bainkon ko nai technology apnaane main samay lag rahaa he
 The country's largest bank State Bank of India (SBI) plans to bring all transactions under one platform in the next two years
 bank yah kaam apane digital banking plateform 'yono' kii madad se karegaa
 That is, SBI will take two years to do so
 is ap par ek jagah sabhi banking, vittiya sevaayen, shopping aadi kii suvidha hogi
 According to an estimate, the number of mobile connections in India has crossed one billion and the number of smartphone users is expected to reach 52 crore by the year 2020
 desh kii kareeb aadhi aabaadi 30 saal se kam he jo kaaphi techno saivi he, lekin banking sector abhi iskaa puraa phayda nahin uthaa paa rahaa
 Hemant Beniwal, the Reserve Bank's strictly certified financial planner, said, "in fact, the Reserve Bank and the banks themselves have taken some strictures in view of the increasing fraud in digital transactions
 ho saktaa he ki is vajah se kuch raftaar kam ho rahi ho
 But it is a continuously growing matter
 bank, pement bank, wolet nirantar nai technology apana kar dhokhadhadi ko kam se kam karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, such transactions are becoming safe, due to which their use is to increase continuously in the coming years
 'rigerv bank ne haal ke varshon main khaskar pement bainkon ko lekar kaaphi sakhti barti he
 In the case of payment gateways like Paytm, Phone Pay, strict action has been taken in this case to fulfill the 'KYC' ie Know Your Customer Requirement of every customer
 rigerv bank ne apane guideline main badlaav karte hue haal ke varshon main kaha tha ki pement bainkon ko kevaisi ke maamle main arabiai ke master diarection kaa anupaalan karnaa hoga or isamen samay-samay par hone vaale badlaav ko bhi apnaanaa hoga
 It will be for all customers and will also include existing customers of telecom companies, which have been linked to the payment bank
 udhaaharan ke liye agar airtel apane kisi graahak ko apane pement bank se jodatii he to use nae sire se apane graahak ke kevaisi norm ko puraa karnaa hoga
 Not only this, Reserve Bank has said that all types of digital wallets will also have to be fully KYC compliant
 isi vajah se petm jaise jo plateform pehle sabko aasaani se mutual fund, gold kharidne jaisi tamaam suvidhaayen de rahe the, ve ab isamen sakhti se kevaisi kaa paalan karne lage hai
 After demonetisation was slowed, there was a tremendous increase in digital banking during the demonetisation
 lekin saal 2017 main rigerv bank ke aankadon ke mutabik notebandi ke baad bazaar main nakadi kii sthiti sudharne ke baad digital len-dein main giravat ai thi
 Transactions via card and POS machines declined by nearly 30 per cent to 21 crore in February 2017 as compared to December 2016, while mobile banking declined by about 20 per cent to 5 per cent during this period
 5 karod rah gai
 Mobile banking in the year 2017 was Rs 1,86,200 crore
 kya hoti he digital bankingsaadharan shabdon main kahen to digital banking kaa matlab he sabhi banking gatividhiyon kaa ek jagah online uplabdh hona
 The advantage of this is that the customer does not need to go to a bank and he can get banking facilities 24 hours a week, seven days a week from his mobile, laptop or desktop
 isamen paisa jamaa karnaa, nikasi, transfar karnaa, check mangana, seaving account management, lone management, bill pement, account sarvice kisi vittiya seva ke liye aavedan karnaa aadi shaamil hai
 Digital banking can be further improved by the latest technology such as natural language processing skills, artificial intelligence, chatboats, virtual agents etc

 Britannia has challenged the September 6 order of the High Court
 court ne apane aadesh main company se kaha tha ki vah apane neutri chwis digestive jirobiscuitke liye istemaal kii ja rahi packing par roak lagaae kyonki unki packing itisi ke sunfist biscuit se milti he
 The matter will now be heard on September 15

 The court gave this order on the petition of rival ITC Ltd of Britannia

 ITC launched this biscuit in July 2016

 The court said that Britannia can adopt any packing other than ITC, similar packing confuses customers

 aisa hi kuch najaara sher-e-bangla neshnal stadium par dekhne ko mila, jab team india ko bangladesh ke haathon sharmnaak haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The superpower of the cricket world appeared helpless and poor in front of a weak team
 darasal bangladesh kii yah jeet koi tukka nahin he, balki bangladesh ne apane damakham or skills ke jariye bharat ko jameendoj kiya he
 Let's have a look why Team India lost
 
 Before the Bangladesh tour, there was speculation that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) might not send its full strength team to Bangladesh
 lekin jis tarah bangla tigers ne pakistan ko apane ghar main bulaakar 3-0 se peeta tha, kahin na kahin wo khauf bharat ke andar bhi haaavee ho chukaa tha or unhone best posible team bhejnaa hi behatar samajha
 The bcci's move was nothing short of a win for Bangladesh as they forced India to send their strongest team
 mugalate main rah gaye umesh, bhubaneshwar or mohit
 
 bharat kii haar kii sabase pehali vajah team india ke gendbaaj hai
 Indian bowlers made the mistake of taking Bangladesh lightly, and due to this mistake, they were beaten a lot
 hairaani kii baat yah rahi ki bharat ke bowler jab gendbaaji kar rahe the us samay lag rahaa tha ki pich par tej gendbaajon ke liye kuch he hi nahin
 But as the Bangladesh bowlers started bowling, it suddenly seemed that there was a dramatic change in the mood of the pitch
 lekin darasal aisa kuch tha nahin
 The discipline introduced by the bowlers of Bangladesh did not show in the bowlers of India
 jo veriation bangla tigers ne apni gendbaaji main dikhaai wo bharat kii taraf se missing rahi
 The bowlers of Team India have to understand that nothing is named
 sirf kehane se nahin chalegaa kaam, kohli-dhoni ko karke dikhaanaa hoga
 
 isamen koi shaq nahin kimahendra singh dhoni bataur captain, bataur ballebaaj, bataur wicketiper behad kaamyaab rahe hai
 But sometimes Dhoni's behavior makes him think
 haalanki yah baat sach he ki dhoni bhaawanaaon par kaabo rakhane ke liye khaase mashhoor hai, lekin kabhi kabhi bhavanaaen chehre par na aaen to sawaal khadey hone lagate hai
 Many times it happens that after losing the match, Dhoni is seen to be inattentive, which stings the fans
 dhoni or kohli kaa jo laaparvaahee bharaa andaaj maidan main najar aayaa vah dukh dene vaala tha
 Especially the way Virat Kohli was dismissed was irresponsible
 kohli behtareen cricketer hai isamen koi shaq nahin, lekin unhen yah samajhnaa hoga ki vah har gend par ran nahin bana sakate
 Kohli needs to consider the shot selection
 kyonki isi kharaab shot salection kii vajah se world cap semifinal main viraat kii khaasi kirakiri ho chuki he
 The way Dhoni and Shikhar Dhawan were dismissed is also upsetting the cricket lovers a lot
 in ballebaajon ko samajhnaa hoga ki virdohi chaahe jo bhi use kamjor na aanka jaae
 Arrogance overwhelms Team India
 
 Team India arrived there this time with the intention of beating Bangladesh mercilessly
 kyonki world cap quarter final ke baad jis tarah se bangladesh baar baar apane fan ko failaa rahaa tha use kuchalanaa team india ke liye behad jaruri bhi tha
 Because Bangladeshi fans as well as Bangladeshi players also believe that India won the World Cup quarter finals because of cheating
 yah mauka tha bangladesh ko sabak sikhaane kaa, lekin yahaan to ulta hi ho gaya
 Bangladesh taught the lesson to Team India only
 darasal iske peeche sabase badi vajah team india main talmail kii kami or ahankaar he
 a big partnership in the middle order could have won the match to India, but all of them appeared in their own tune
 haalanki jatke lagane ke baad khilaadiyon ko hosh to aayaa, lekin tab tak kaaphi der ho chuki thi
 If India had become a partnership before Raina and Jadeja tried, Team India would not have suffered this humiliating defeat
 manovaigyanik jang main bhi bangladeshi khilaadiyon se peeche rahe indian players
 
 ek samay wo tha jab match se pehle hi bangladesh kii haar tay maani jaati thi
 Today is a tour when the opponents have to field their strongest team against them
 bangladesh aankh se aankh milakar khel rahaa he, or iskaa pramaan pehla vanade he, jahaan bangladeshi sledging main bhi peeche nahin rahe
 The bowling, batting and fielding of Bangladesh, all three look excellent
 cricket ab takat kaa kam, dimag kaa khel zyada ho gaya he
 The best thing is that every player from Bangladesh is mentally ready to play international cricket
 yang cricketron kaa jo pool bangladesh taiyaar kar rahaa he usase yah baat saaf he ki aane vaale samay main is team kaa danka jarur bajegaa
 Until that Monday, there was nothing in the life of 24-year-old Ravi Singh, who needed a separate statement, was originally a boy from a modest family in Sinhaani Gate area of ghaziabad and lived in Vishwas Park area of delhi

 According to the trend of unemployed boys here, he also used to spend time with two or four redundant boys in hosting
 or jab kabhi parivaar kaa dabaav had se bad jaataa to thodaa-bahut kaam karke jaan chhudaata
 Ravi first grew in love with his cousin sister-in-law Renu
 jab renu kii shaadi ravi ke duusare chachere bhai se ho gai to uski choti bahan baby se ravi kaa ekatarfa pyaar is had tak pahunchaa ki use jabaran bhagaakar shaadi karne kii koshish karne laga
 But the attempt failed
 3 sitambar kaa vah somvaar jab khatm hua to na sirf ravi kii jindagi khatm ho chuki thi, balki vah sansanikhej dhang se apni maut ke pehle paanch katl bhi kar chukaa tha
 a slight youngster was at the center of a completely unusual murder mystery
 police kii ab tak kii jaanch par bharosa karen to ravi ke dimag main kuch khuraafaat pehle se hi chal rahi thi
 He was in the rented house of his cousin Yashpal alias Naveen alias Monu in Sanjay Enclave in Bindapur on the day of the crime i
e
 two days before Monday
 naveen se hi uski kathith purv premika renu kii shaadi hui thi
 According to the neighbors, Ravi often used to come to Naveen's house and sometimes the cab driver himself used to work for the help of Naveen
 upree taur par sab shant dikhataa tha lekin naveen ko ravi kaa apane ghar aana-janaa pasand nahin tha
 Ravi's father Kripal told, "we are all relatives and we have tried constantly to make Ravi break away from Renu
 is baat ko lekar naveen or renu kaa jhagada bhi hota rahata tha
 Later, there was some sort of reconciliation in mian-biwi, but all this spoiled Ravi's mind
 ’’ 2010 main renu kii shaadi ke baad ek taraf ravi jahaan use apane dil se nahin nikaal paaya, vahiin uski choti bahan 18 varshiya baby par bhi dore daalane laga
 However, according to Delhi Police, Ravi was not only camped at Naveen's house for two days, but also with a pistol and a desi katta
 do gaiyr-kanoonee hathiyaar lekar ghoomane vaale yuvak ke bare main haalanki dilli police yahi maanati he ki uskaa koi aapraadhik record nahin tha
 According to the landlord's son Dinesh Garg, on Sunday night, Ravi, Renu and Naveen Santro also went to roam somewhere in the car
 lekin unke waapas aane ke baad jarur kuch anhoni hui
 Because the post-mortem report says that Naveen was killed on Sunday night, while Renu and landlady Sheila Garg were killed around 9 am
 renu or shila garg hatyakand kaa zikr karte hue dinesh ne bataaya, ‘‘subah 9 baje ke kareeb ham logon ne naveen ke yahaan se jhagade kii awaajen sunin
 Hearing the sound, my mother Sheela went to the third floor towards Naveen's house
 main kuch samaj paata, isse pehle hi ek ke baad ek kai goliyaan chalane kii aawaaj sunai di or ravi haath main bandooken liye dandanaata neeche utraa
 "before Dinesh could understand anything, Ravi asks him to get out of the way and go upstairs to find out his mother's well being
" idhar dinesh sidhiruaan chadhakar upar gaya, udhar ravi sentro car se apane agle shikaar kii ore bad chalaa
 Dinesh goes upstairs to see that Renu and Sheela have been shot and killed
 khun se lathpath do laashen kamare ke farsh par padi hai, haalanki us vakt na to use or na hi baad main maukey par pahunchi police ko naveen kii laash dikhi
 Naveen's body was found 12 hours later at 9 pm from the same house
 naveen kii laash ke baraamad hone main hui yah deree noida ke charchit aarushi-hemraj hatyakand main hemraj kii laash milane main hui deree se bahut mail khaati he
 The Delhi Police got involved in legal action after the double (murder later revealed) triple murder at 9 am
 sentro car kaa number milane ke baavjood, har chowk-chauraahey par bairicade lagaakar aam aadmi se hill-huzzat karne vaali dilli police car ke bare main kuch pataa nahin laga saki
 Nobody had any idea where Ravi's mind and his steps are going to go next
 idhar hatyakand kii khabar aag kii tarah fail gai
 Renu's parents were also found murdered in Ishapur village near Modinagar in Ghaziabad, about 90 km from Bindapur in Delhi
 renu ke pita harendra sadame main aa gaye or apni choti beti baby ko lekar dilli chalane kii taiyaari karne lage
 On the other hand, Ravi definitely had blood on his head, but his brain kept working like a vicious criminal
 bindapur se car main vah dilli main dabri ke paas rajapuri vaale ghar aayaa
 Here he left the car and reached Mayapuri with a bike
 vahaan pahunchakar usne ek baar phir motorcical badali or dost kii pulsar motorcical lekar, is kahani kaa dardanaak ant karne ishapur chal diya
 Describing what happened in Ishapur, Harendra's brother Devendra said, "it will be about one and a half in the afternoon, a red colored Pulsar motorcycle stopped at Bhaiya's door
" ek ladkaa bike se utraa
 He was wearing a helmet
 jab tak main kuch samajhataa, uske haath main do tamanchey lahraane lage
 Wearing helmets and wearing a helmet on his head, he entered directly into Harendra's house
 ’’ dinesh ne jo vakya bindapur kaa sunaaya, kuch vaisaa hi manjar ab devendra ke saamne tha
 Devendra said, "within minutes of entering the boy's house, there was a sound of firing bullets
" ’’ devendra or kuch padosi kamare main ghuse to yahaan harendra or unki beti baby kii laash farsh par padi thi
 Both were shot from close quarters
 harendra ke seene par teen goliyaan maari, jabaki baby ke sir par goli lagi thi
 Seeing the people, the attacker locked himself in a room in the house
 kamare kii ghuti-ghuti hawa main khun kii gandh thi
 Everyone was silent due to panic
 lekin sannata kuch pal kaa hi tha or ek baar phir band kamare se goli chalane kii aawaaj ai
 It was the last pill that day
 kareeb 2
 Police reached the scene at 20
 band kamare kaa darwaja kisi tarah kholaa to bheetar ek noujvaan kii laash padi thi
 He was Ravi
 aadha darjan mauton kii jaanch achaanak sir par aa jane ke baad police ko koi theory nahin sujh rahi thi
 Ghaziabad SP Dehat Jagdish Sharma said the next day, "ravi was no madcap (psychopath) killer
" use to halaat ne hatyara bana diya
 We do not even have a criminal record of his
 ’’ kuch aisi hi raay dakshin pashchim dilli ke asipi anil kumaar ojha kii bhi he
 Asked where the weapons came to Ravi, Ojha said, "the one who got the weapons is dead
" ab koun batayega ki hathiyaar kahaan se mili
 "weapons should come from anywhere, but the lives they ended up with were precious
" agar police ko ravivaar raat hue pehle katl (naveen) kii samay rahete bhanak lag jaati to shaayad baaki jindagiyaan batch jaatin
 But the police have their own ways of doing things
 baharhaal, ravi chalaa gaya or peeche chhod gaya apane andhe mata-pita or unki syah jindagi

 On June 27, when Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was giving a speech in the Legislative Assembly, newly elected BJP MLA from Madarihat Manoj Tigga chanted 'jai Shri Ram'
 mukhyamantri bolte-bolte bich main ruk gayi or sadan kii saansen ek visphot kii ashanka main maano tham-si gayi
 But to everyone's surprise, Mamata gave a hint of anger to her own legislators to remain calm
 phir unhone bhaashan puraa kiya or uskaa ant 'vande maataram' ke saath kiya
 At the same time, she could not stop telling the BJP members that it was written by a Bengali Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay who had a birthday that day
 sadan maano sakate main tha
 Always in a fighting mood, Mamata looked calm and even hinted at harmony
 yakeenan, pichley kuch dinon se ve kaaphi vinamr najar aa rahi thim or unhone varisht makapa netaa sujan chakravarti ko 'sujan da' or varisht congress netaa abdul mannaan ko 'mannaan bhai' kahkar sambodhit kiya tha
 This soft attitude has also seen its benefits
 sujan da or mannaan bhai pehle kabhi vidhansabha ke us galiyare kii taraf bhi nahin fatakate the jisamen mukhyamantri kaa daftar he
 But now they started coming to his room often and sitting with the Chief Minister on the tea and ghughni (boiled chickpeas / peas), started making strategies for coordination in the House
 aam chunaavon main 12 loksabhaa siten ganvaane ke baad hi trinmul congress pramukh ko yah sabak mila tha ki rajya main vipaksh ke liye rajnatik jagah ko kam karke unhone darasal ek rajnatik shunya paidaa kar diya tha, jise aakraamak bhaajapa ne badi dakshata ke saath bharne kii koshish kii
 Therefore, just two months after the results, Mamata is not only talking about political plurality but she has also asked the Trinamool cadre to open political space for both the CPI (M) and the Congress
 party netaaon ko unki nai salaah yah thi ki ''vipakshiyon (yani makapa or congress) par kuch thopen nahin
 We have to co-exist
 ''unhone july main aisi hi ek apil sadan ke patal par bhi kii thi or vam dalon tathaa congress se anurodh kiya tha ki ve hindi pattee se ai us 'fasivadi bhaajapa' ko haraane main madad karen jo bengali samskruti tathaa manyataon se anjaan he
 The 20 per cent drop in the vote share of the Left parties and the 23 per cent increase in the bjp's vote percentage have worried Mamata — so much so that she is telling the Left leaders to focus on rebuilding their parties Give trinmul congress ke 2011 main satta man aane ke baad kamredon ke jin party daftaron par trinmul ne kabja kar liya tha ve ab unhen lautaae ja rahe hai
 Mamta has also become a bit soft towards the CPI-M workers' unions, which still have a good influence within the government employees
 in unionon ke jin 17 netaaon ko doordaraj ke ilaakon main bhej diya gaya tha, unhen bhi waapas le aayaa gaya he
 Also, the land has finally been approved for the proposed Jyoti Basu Center for Social Studies and Research
 isi tarah vam niyantran vaale silligudi sthaneey nikaay ke bakaaye ko bhi sweekrut kar diya gaya he
 However, the Left parties are still apprehensive
 makapa kii kendriya samiti sadsy robin deb kaa kahana tha, ''mamata kii is udaartaa ko parakhnaa hoga
 They are in crisis right now, so they are extending their hand to us
 ''mamata kii dayalutaa kaa phayda congress ko bhi hua he
 Party leader Nepal Mahato, who holds a good standing in Purulia region, has been asked to mediate with the tribals for a power project in the Ayodhya hills
 us jile main bhaajapa kaa pradarshan acha rahaa he—usne loksabhaa seat ke alaava 40 fisadi panchayat siten bhi jiti hai
 Professor Emiratus Prashant Ray at Presidency University says that Mamata is trying to project the notion of a common secular opposition as an alternative to the BJP
 unke shabdon main, ''maujuuda halaat ne pichley chunaavon main bhaajapa ko phayda pahunchaaya kyonki log sarkaar ko chunauti dene ke liye majboot vipaksh kii talash kar rahe the
 "that's why Mamata is now making the political arena open so that voters will have more options
" ab, yah sab party kii surat badalane kii raajnneetik ranneetikaar prashanth kishor kii yojanaon kaa bhi hissaa ho saktaa he
 Meanwhile, the Trinamool chief has also started an exercise to clean his party
 haal hi main party kii ek samiksha baithak main unhone kaha, ''agar aapane koi galati kii he to logon ke paas jaakar maafee maang lijie
 Instead of allowing a third party to take advantage of it, let people take out anger and frustration on you as well
 '' unhone is par jor diya ki trinmul ke kader ko atmavlokan karnaa hoga
 In the last one month, Mamata has held ten such meetings and her emphasis has been on those districts where the party's performance has been poor
 'cat-mani' ke mudde par to ve pehle hi sansani failaa chuki hai
 While the opposition parties started cashing in on the issue by demanding the recovery of the Trinamool leaders from the people, the Trinamool also raised similar demands in places like Basirhat, Bongaon and Ranaghat, where BJP leaders have been accused of recovery
 cat-mani kii shikayaton par trinmul kii shikaayat nivaaran cell ke pramukh party netaa deeptanshu choudhary kaa kahana tha, ''samasya se sidhaa muqabla karke mamata ne bada durlabh saahas dikhaaya he
 Now Trinamool wants the other parties to clarify their stand on the issue of corruption
 bhaajapa netaaon ke khilaaf bhi alpiji vitaran ghotaalaa, bacchon kii taskari jaise kai gambhir cese hai
 "mamata has launched a cleanliness drive against corruption in her own party
 Now why does Mamata want to co-exist with the Congress and the Left? The Trinamool chief has now realized that the BJP has benefited from decimating the old opposition
" vam dalon ke vot pratishat main hui 20 pratishat kii giravat zyaadaatar bhaajapa ke khate main chali gai he
 Worried, Mamata has requested the CPI (M) leaders to focus on 'reinvigorating the party' and the Trinamool cadre will not impose its position on the Left parties and the Congress
 makapa ke party karyaalay bhi party ko lautaa die gaye hai
 Even union leaders of the Left parties have been left open and are being deployed in areas of choice
 jyoti basu centre for soshal studies and research ke liye jameen manjuur ho gai he
 The Left and Congress are being included in the strategy of coordination of the House
 lekin vam dal ab bhi mamata kii niyat ko lekar ashankit hai

 trinmul congress adhyaksh mamata banerjee ne in khabaron ko sire se khaarij kar diya ki unki party bijepi ke saath gathbandhan karegi
 He said it bluntly, it will never happen
 mamata ne ek chunaav raily main kaha, aisa kabhi nahin hoga
 never
 congress ke kuch baabuon ko tivi channelon par aisa kehane ke liye kaha gaya he, isliye vah yah kah rahe hai ki ham bijepi ke saath jaaenge
 The direct reference of the Trinamool chief was towards West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee President Adhir Chaudhary
 bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ne endie ke satta main aane kii sthiti main pashchim bengal ko 'acha package' dene kaa vaada kiya, jisaki prishthbhumi main choudhary ne shanivaar ko yah baat kahi thi
 He (chaudhary) reportedly said, Rajnath Singh said so yesterday
 ham lambey samay se kehete aa rahe hai ki bijepi tathaa trinmul congress ke sambandh utaar-chadhaav vaale rahe hai
 Denying an alliance with the BJP, Mamta said it is not possible with the party that wants to divide the state, Bengalis and non-bengalis
 mamata ne bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi kaa naam liye bina kaha, main lambey samay se raajnneeti main hum or kabhi bengaaliyon tathaa gaiyr bengaaliyon kii raajnneeti main nahin uljhi
 It is not in our culture

 bisisiai ne akhabaaron main chhapi un khabaron kaa khandan kiya jisamen kaha gaya he ki vishwa cap jeetne vaali team ke khilaadi ek ke bajaay paanch karod rupee kaa inaam die jane kii maang kar rahe he
 Cricket Board Secretary n Srinivasan said that there is no truth in such reports that the players are demanding more reward than what the BCCI has promised (one crore)
 unhone kaha, is report kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 This is the wrong thing
 khilaadi ne is prakaar kii koi maang nahin rakhi he
 It is worth mentioning that without mentioning the name of the top player, it has been said that the players want that each player should be given five crores to win the World Cup
 vishwa cap jeetne ke turant baad bisisiai ne prayek khilaadi ek ek karod rupaye dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 "we are not hungry for money, but what is the harm in asking for more money as the board will earn crores of rupees after India wins the World Cup," the report quoted the player as saying in the newspaper
 dedh saal pehaledrugske mudde par congress nepunjabaki siyaasi jang fatah kiya tha
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi had made drugs a big issue in the election and Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh had promised to ban drugs
 lekin ab sattadhari congress party hofimkikhetiko legal karne maang karne lagi he
 Navjot Singh Sidhu, Captain's minister in the Punjab government, has demanded that opium be legalized in Punjab
 unhen mukhyamantri amarinder kaa bhi saath mil gaya he
 On Sunday, Sidhu said that my uncle also used to eat opium, he used it as medicine
 or unhone lambii jindagi bhi ji
 He says that opium is much better than heroin
 siddhu ke sur main sur siem amarinder bhi milaane lage hai
 The Captain said, 'we are happy that once again the issue of legalizing poppy cultivation has come up for discussion
 main ummid karata hum ki ise gambhirtha se dekha jayega
 This issue will be resolved forever
 'haalanki amarinder ne kaha ki mukhyamantriyon kii pradhanmantri ke saath sammelan main unhone ye mudda uthaaya tha
 Opium should be cultivated in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh and Punjab should become its market
 ye kaise ho saktaa he
 He said that there should be a policy on what the pharmaceutical companies need
 ham jaanate hai ki kis tarah se anya rajyon se opium or usase jude drugs laabhprad market main aate hai
 Before Sidhu, let us tell you that AAP MP Dharamvir Gandhi had demanded that the cultivation of opium and its produce should be legalized in the state
 dilachasp baat ye he ki aam aadmi party or congress donon ne punjab vidhansabha kaa puraa chunaav hi drugs ke mudde par ladaa tha
 The result was that the Akali Dal had to be ousted from power
 aise main ab satta main aate hi opium kii kheti ko leagan karne kii maang uthne lagi he
 Presently, opium cultivation in India is done in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
 rajasthan ke jhalawad, baaraa, chittorgarh, pratapgarh, bhilwara kshetra main opium kii kheti hoti he
 Opium is cultivated in Neemuch, Mandsaur, Ratlam and Uttar Pradesh Faizabad, Barabanki, Bareilly, Badaun regions of Madhya Pradesh
 opium main daanen (posta) or opium doodh ke utpaadan ke liye kendriya narkotics beauron dwaara jari patte ke aadhaar par kii jaati hai
 Farming without a narcotics department is counted as a legal offense
 opium kii kheti karne ke liye upyukt jalwaayu kii ahm jarurat hoti he
 It requires a temperature of around 20 to 25 degrees Celsius for cultivation
 darasal opium kii kheti kii ore log sabase zyada aakarshith hote hai
 The biggest reason for this is simple
 bahut hi kam laagat main chappar faad kamai kaa hona
 Opium cultivation is illegal in the country, but if it is done with the approval of the Narcotics Department, then you have no fear
 isi maddenjar punjab main opium kii kheti kii maang jor pakadaney lagi he
 The biggest threat to poppy cultivation in Punjab is being considered
 press coffrence main patrakaron ne jab punjab police ke mahanideshak suresh aroda se rajya main opium kii kheti kii maang ko lekar sawaal kiya
 To this he said that he said that legal opinion is being taken on this issue
 rajya main nashe kii samasya se nipatane ke liye is hetu gathit vishesh task force se talmail banaakar ankush lagaaya ja rahaa he
 The Punjab government is taking strict steps to end drug abuse in the state
 beete dinon hi punjab ke siem captain amarinder singh ne sabhi sarkari adhikariyon kaa dope test karaane kii baat kahi thi, jiske baad rajya main hadakamp much gaya tha
 Explain that the Punjab government is bringing a provision of strict law against drugs in the state
 rajya sarkaar ne nashe ke taskaron ke doshiyon ke liye maut kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 Apart from this, de-addiction centers are also being run in many places in the state

 bjp's PM candidate is also very much in demand party of Narendra Modi
 loksabhaa chunaav ke maidan main utraa bijepi kaa har ummidavaar chahta he ki modi uske kshetra main raily karen
 The worry in the bjp's war room is how the slogan of 'ghar-ghar Modi' should succeed
 party ne haalanki modi kii reliyon kii sankhya badhaane kii yojana ko antim rup dene main juty he
 The party has decided that Modi will conduct a total of 200 rallies throughout the elections
 party ne ye bhi tay kiya he ki 3 di vijay sankalp reliyon ke madhyam se modi kam se kam 1000 sthanon tak bhi pahunchenge
 Modi has been organizing rallies across the country since he was declared the bjp's PM candidate
 haryana ke rewadi se shuru hui reliyon kaa silsilaa abhi lagbhag 60 tak pahunchaa hi tha kii bijepi ko lagane laga ki raftaar aisi hi rahi to zyada se zyada loksabhaa siton tak pahunchnaa mushkil ho jayega
 If sources are to be believed, the party has decided to increase the number of daily rallies of Modi from 4 to 5, while at present Modi's 2-3 rallies are being held everyday
 iske alaava modi kii chunaav main kul 200 reliyaan karne kaa iraadaa he
 Through these rallies, Modi will reach a total of 290-295 Lok Sabha seats
 kamjor siton par bhi vishesh dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 The BJP is not ready to formally disclose about this, but is giving so much indication that the effort is that no seat is left out
 beete saal vailentaines de ke din 'bhagwaan ke aadesh par' dilli se dil lagane vaale arvind kejariwal ne ek saal, saat maheene baad hi vah kiya, jiske liye siyaasi taur par unki bhad pitati ai he
 u turn! Yes, this 'common man' who took the oath never to leave Delhi for 5 years from Ramlila Maidan has spoken of 'burying the pegs' till the elections in Punjab on Wednesday
 khaas baat yah he ki dilli kaa saath kabhi nahin chhodane kaa vaada karne kejariwal kii sarkaar dilli main whatrup par chal rahi he or unke mantri goa or punjab ke liye siyaasi sur kas rahe hai
 Actually, it is not just about promise here
 baat us ahankaar kii bhi he, jiskaa khaakaa kejariwal ne ramlila maidan se manch se khinchaa tha
 Remember, after taking oath on 14 February 2015, Kejriwal had said, 'I hear that our leaders are saying that Delhi won will now win other states of the country as well
 ye thik nahin he
 It shows arrogance
 ahankaar mat karnaa, varna vahi haal hoga, jo congress kaa hua
 BJP was born
 janata se congress ko ahankaar kii vajah se hi dilli se ukhaad phenkaa
 It was due to arrogance that the BJP met in Delhi after the Lok Sabha elections
 'satta kaa nasha or punjab-goa kii raahto ye wo baaten thim jo tab kejariwal ne kahi thi
 After the 49-day government, the second Chief Minister of Delhi had also said that now he will not go anywhere for 5 years
 yahi nahin, iske liye unhone bhagwaan ke aadesh kaa zikr bhi kiya tha
 But it is clear that in the last one year, somewhere, the head of the Somaras Aam Aadmi Party of power rose so much that now the intoxication is also to 'de-addiction' Punjab and also to the Feni of Goa
 bhagwaan ke aadesh kaa kya hua?sawaal ye bhi he ki agar beete saal dilli main kejariwal ne jo kaha wo bhagwaan kaa aadesh tha, to yakeenan guuruuvaar ko unhone ludhiana main jo kaha vah us aadesh kii avhelnaa jaisaa
 And when Kejriwal himself confessed at the Ramlila ground that God had punished him for leaving Delhi for Benares, did he learn anything from him
 kyonki kejariwal ne khud kaha tha, 'loksabhaa chunaav main jo hua, vah bhagwaan ne sajaa di he
 Of ego
 mujhe bhagwaan ne aadesh diya he, dilli kii janata ne aadesh diya he or ab main paanch saal kahin nahin jaaoongaa
 'kejriwal is adept at taking responsibility and giving up! Among the opponents, it is very famous about Arvind Kejriwal that he leaves the first one for the next as soon as he gets a responsibility
 masalan, kejariwal iaiti main ejeeniyar bane to iares ke liye ejineering chhod di
 Quitted IRS job to work as an NGO
 sadak par bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ladane ke liye enjio kaa kaam chhod diya or raajnneeti karne ke liye aakhirkaar sadak par sakriy kaaryakarta kaa kaam chhod diya
 When she became the Chief Minister of Delhi, she left Delhi to contest the Lok Sabha elections
 to kya ab yah maanakar chalaa jaae ki dilli ke siem ab punjab or goa kii raah par chal pade hai
 Veteran midfield Paul Scholes of Manchester United, the club that won the Premier League title this year, has announced his retirement from professional football
 scoles antarrashtriya footbal se 2004 main hi sanyas le chuke the
 According to the website 'euro Sport
com Co Dot UK', Scholes' decision was expected as he had not renewed his contract with United and had been asking to leave professional football for several seasons
 reyaan gigs kii tarah scoles bhi is satr main fitness sambandhi samasya se jujhate rahe or yahi kaaran he ki vah 2010 satr main united ke liye sirf 16 match khel sake
 Nonetheless, Scholes can be considered one of United's all-time greatest players
 unke team main rahete united ne 10 lig khitaab, do champiens lig khitaab, chaar egge cap or teen lig cap khitaab jite
 Scholes, who were inducted into the club in search of manager Alex Ferguson in 1992, are placed on the list of legendary players playing in the Premier League, like French player Zinedine Zidan and Spain's Xavi
 scoles ne england kii rashtriya team ke liye 60 match khele lekin club ke saath apane samarpan ke kaaran unhone 2004 main antarrashtriya footbal ko alavida kah diya tha
 Alex said on Scholes' farewell, "what can i say about Scholes that i haven't said to him before?" hamen ek mahaan or haroonges khilaadi kii kami khalegi
 Scholes always played with full dedication to the club

 sawaal yah bhi he ki yah sirf laaparvaahee he yaa aropiyon ko bachaane kii sajeesh? Mumbai Police may have a good detection rate but questions have been raised about the conviction rate

 The ruling party and the opposition have their own claims
 isi maahaul main suchanadhikaar kaaryakarta- lekhak sanjoy basu, niraj kumaar or shashi shekhar kii ek kitaab ai he, 'vaada farmoshi- facts, fiction nahin, artiai par aadhaarit

 lekhakon ne sarkaar pichley 3 varshon main daayar vaastavik artiai ke aadhaar par yah pustak likhi
 He says that this book reflects the reality of many schemes and promises of the Modi government
 kitaab ke locarpan ke maukey par lekhakon ne bataaya ki unhone is chunavi mausam main sarkaar ke daavon kii sachai ko pathakon ke saamne laane kaa ek eemaandaar prayaas kiya he, kyonki lagbhag 3 dashakon ke baad, 2014 main centre main purna bahumat kii sarkaar thi
 The mantra of this government was - minimum government and maximum governance
 shuruyaat se hi desh ne kai kendriya yojanaon ke prachaar par baari sarkari kharch dekha
 So it was important to know what was the end result of all those announcements and schemes? This book is a document of the functioning of the Modi government in the last five years
 lekhakon kaa maananaa he ki kisi bhi media, enjio, vyakti yaa kisi anya sanstha ne samagrata se aisa kaam nahin kiya he

 He said that he considers Aruna Rai as his mentor and believes that in a democracy, or a democracy, the RTI serves the people of the nation, because in such a system the people are the principal and the government is accountable to them
 kejariwal ne kaha ki desh kii vartmaan sthiti kaaphi daraavnee he, kyonki jab koi naagarik sawaal poochta he yaa sarkaar ke khilaaf apni aawaaj uthaata he, to use 'raashtra-virdohi' kaha jaataa he
 Commenting on the brutal beating by goons in a recent viral video of a Muslim family, Kejriwal said that it was being done in the name of Hindutva, although nowhere in Hinduism was it written to harass Muslims, or anyone, is
 aam aadmi party ke kartadharta arvind kejariwal ne in halaaton par kshobh jaahir karte hue isaki tulana germany main hitler ke shashan ke dauraan prachlit sthiti se kii or kaha kis daur main agar koi hitler ke shashan ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaata tha, to use saarvajanik rup se peeta jaataa tha
 Today we are facing the same conditions in our country
 alpsankhyakon ko peeta jaataa he, agar ve sarkaar or uske kaaryon ke bare main koi prashn poochhate hai,kejariwal ne daawa kiya ki vah aashwast hai ki agar modi sarkaar 2019 kaa chunaav jitati he to ye aakhri chunaav honge or ve samvidhan ko badal denge, jaisaa ki sakshi maharaj ne daawa kiya he

 unhone kaha ki hamen apane netaa kaa chayan karne kaa adhikaar azaadi ke saath hi mil gaya lekin artiai ke madhyam se suchit ho kar vot dene kaa adhikaar paane main 60 saal lag gaye
 One of the RTI activists and co-authors, Neeraj Kumar, said that he got the data for the book after 2 years and many rtis because it was difficult to extract information from the government
 unhone kaha ki pustak pathakon ko centre sarkaar ke prachaar main ek antardrushti degi or unhen sarkaar ke dwaara shuru kii gai yojanaon kaa vaastavik cheharaa dikhaaegi

 kuch multiplexes main ek audi kii booking hi shuru kii gai thi, jiskaa matlab 'golmaal agen' ke sirf 4-5 shoj kii booking hi khuli thi
 It seems that the producers of Golmaal Again (reliance and Rohit Shetty) do not want the Aamir Khan starrer 'secret Superstar' to make a difference
 Review: diarector kii film he sikret superstar, dangal ke baad aamir ko dekhnaa dilachaspahaalanki producers ke is faisle se 'golmaal agen' kii team khush nahin lag rahi he or wo chaahati he ki 70% shoj unki film ko mili
 This means that they want the 'secret Superstar' to get only 30% of the screen
 vahiin duusari ore aamir khan ne is maamle main koi drama nahin kiya he
 He is sitting in the belief that both 'secret Superstar' and 'golmaal Again' will get equal screens

 At the Congress' Vijay Sankalp rally in Panipat, Bhupinder Singh Hooda targeted Narendra Modi and said that he did not take care of the dignity of the post of PM
 hooda ne daawa kiya ki haryana main teesri baar bhi congress kii hi sarkaar banegi
 Significantly, when Bhupinder Singh Hooda started speaking in the presence of PM Modi in a program in Haryana, some people there started making noise by shouting 'modi-modi' slogans
 isi tarah kii ghatana jharkhand kii rajdhani ranchi main siem hemanth sorain ke saath bhi hui

 This has led to the closure of one side of the Krishna Menon road
 vaise pichley 216 din se dilli ke jantar par bhi oopi ko lekar purv sainikon kaa dharna jari he
 Last week too, these soldiers had staged a sit-in outside the official residence of the finance minister, but got up again after getting confidence
 lekin ab inhone tay kiya he ki jab tak sarkaar baatcheet ke liye aage nahin aati he, aise hi saikadon purv sainik sadak par baithe rahenge
 Earlier this month the ex-serviceman met the Finance Minister and told him about the discrepancies in the OROP
 tab sarkaar ne bharosa diya tha ki is hafte wo kuch jabaab degi
 Major General Satbir Singh, chairman of the Indian x Servicemen's Movement, said that we met Jaitley on January 3 and he said that within a week he would talk to the Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar
 phir 9 janvari ko hamane chitthee likhi or unke daftar main baat kii lekin koi jawaab nahin aayaa
 Therefore, we have no other way but to surround ourselves
 ab hamane tay kar liya he jab tak raksha mantri or vitt mantri aakar hamase baat nahin karte tab tak ham yahaan se nahin uthenge
 His spokesperson, Colonel Anil Kaul said that we have come to know that Arun Jaitley is probably in London, yet we will not move from here unless a government representative comes and talks to us and resolves our issue
 isse pehle 14 agast ko jantar mantar se in purv sainikon ko police ne bal purvak hataane kii koshish kii thi lekin uski jabardast aalochana hui jiske baad sarkaar ko apana faisla waapas lenaa padaa
 Although the government had taken out the notification on November 9 on OROP, a group of ex-servicemen have refused to accept it
 inaki maang he ki sarkaar vahi oropi lagu kare jiskaa vaayada unhone sansad main kiya he
 These soldiers are blaming Jaitley for not implementing OROP properly
 isse krishna menon maarg kaa ek ore kaa rasta band ho gaya he
 However, for the last 216 days, at the Jantar of Delhi, the strike of ex-servicemen regarding OOP is going on
 pichley hafte bhi in sainikon ne vitt mantri ke adhikarik nivas ke baahar dharna diya tha lekin bharosa milane par phir vahaan se uth gaye
 But now they have decided that until the government comes forward for talks, hundreds of such ex-servicemen will be sitting on the road
 is maheene kii shuruyaat main purv sainik vitt mantri se mili the or unhen oropi main hui visangatiyon ke bare main bataaya tha
 Then the government had assured that it would give some answers this week
 indian eks sarvicemen movement ke chairmen major general satbir singh ne kaha ki hamane teen janvari ko jetali se mulaakaat kii auki unhone kaha ki ek hafte ke bheetar wo raksh mantri manohar parrikar se baat karenge
 Then on 9 January, we wrote a letter and talked in his office but no response came
 lihaaja hamalogon ke paas gheraav karne ke alaava koi or rasta nahin bachaa
 Now we have decided that till the Defense Minister and Finance Minister come and talk to us, we will not get up from here
 inke pravaktaa karnal anil kaul ne kaha ki hamen pataa laga he ki shaayad arun jetali landan main hai, baavjood iske jab tak sarkaar kaa koi numanida hamase aakar baat nahin karata or hamaare masale ko hal nahin karata tab tak ham yahaan se nahin hilenge
 Earlier on August 14, the police had tried to forcefully remove these ex-servicemen from Jantar Mantar, but there was tremendous criticism after which the government had to withdraw its decision
 vaise sarkaar ne oropi ko lekar nau november ko notification nikaala tha lekin purv sainikon ne ek gut ne ise maanane se inkaar kar diya he
 They demand that the government implement the OROP which they promised in Parliament
 pichley hafte bhi in sainikon ne vitt mantri ke adhikarik nivas ke baahar dharna diya tha lekin bharosa milane par phir vahaan se uth gaye

 President Pratibha Patil has dismissed the mercy petitions of Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar of Punjab and Mahendra Nath Singh of Assam following the recommendations of the Union Home Ministry
 mantralay ke sutron ne yah jaankaree di
 Rashtrapati Bhavan has refused to comment on this
 bhullar ko 25 agast 2001 ko ek nichali adaalat ne 1991 main punjab ke police adhikari sumedh singh saini par tathaa 1993 main yuvak congress ke tatkaaleen adhyaksh emes bitta par aatanki hamalon kii sajeesh rachane ke maamle main maut kii sajaa sunai thi
 Bhullar's lawyer KTS Tulsi had approached the Supreme Court a few years ago to either speedily decide on his mercy petition or change the death sentence he was hearing
 raashtrapati ne mahendra nath das kii bhi dayaa yachika ko khaarij kar diya he jise harkant das naamak shaks kii hatya kaa doshi paaya gaya
 For the first time since 2004, the President has been sentenced to death sentence on a convict

 Opposition parties have repeatedly slammed the government accusing Afzal Guru of delaying the decision on the attack on Parliament, while Home Minister P
P
 chidambaram ne kaha tha ki dayaa yachikaaon par faisla lene kaa koi tay samay nahin hota
 Since taking over as Home Minister in 2008, Chidambaram has been following a policy of running sequentially in deciding mercy petitions
 ab tak kam se kam 15 maamle agreshit kiye gayi hai jinamein se 11 main faisla hua he
 In the list, the case of three people convicted of killing former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi is above the case of Afzal Guru
 afjal kii patni tabassum afjal ne teen aktubar 2006 ko raashtrapati ko apane pati kii maut kii sajaa ko badalane ke liye yachika di thi
 The idea of delhi Government was asked about this

 Under Article 72 of the Constitution, the President has the right to waive the death sentence of a convict or to seal his conviction
 bhartiya janata party rohtak loksabhaa seat yuddh kii chaaya main hi jiti he, jansangh ke binar tale party do baar 1962 or 1971 main yahaan se kamyaabi mili thi
 After that, the BJP has been craving to win this seat
 haalanki 1999 ke chunaav main bijepi kaa indian neshnal lokdal ke saath gathbandhan tha or yahaan se INLD ke ummidavaar captain inder singh ko jeet mili thi
 Therefore, it has not been able to return to this seat for the last nearly 30 years
 ab 2019 ke chunaav main bijepi kii koshish he ki kisi tarah yahaan se 3 baar saansad rahe deependra singh hooda ko maat di jaae
 The 2014 mandate: Despite the Modi wave in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Congress candidate Deepender Singh Hooda defeated the BJP candidate by 1,70,436 votes from Rohtak Lok Sabha seat in Haryana
 deependra singh hooda ko 46
 There were a total of 4,90,063 votes with 86 percent votes, while bjp's candidate Om Prakash Dhankad got 30
 55 fisadi vot share ke saath kul 3,19,436 vot pade the
 While the third number was the candidate of the INLD with 1,51,120 votes Shamsher Singh Kharkada
 aam aadmi party ke ummidavaar naveen jaihind ko 46,759 vot pade the
 At the same time, 4,932 voters used NOTA
 isse pehle 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main deependra singh hooda ne 2014 se bhi badi jeet hasil kii thi
 In this election, Hooda defeated Nafe Singh Rathi of INLD by 4,45,736 votes
 hooda ko kareeb 70 fisadi vot ke saath kul 5,85,016 mat mila tha
 The Rohtak Lok Sabha constituency has 9 assembly seats
 jinke naam- gadhi-saanpala-kiloi, maham, rohtak, kalanur, bahadurgard, badali, jhajjar, beri or koshali he, in 9 siton main se 5 par congress ko jeet mili he or 4 par bijepi kaa kabja he
 The social fabric of the Lok Sabha seat has been held 17 times from 1952 to 2014, most of the Jat community leaders have become mps
 kyonki rohtak main jat voters kii aabaadi kaaphi zyada he
 Therefore, the parties mostly nominate Jat community leaders as candidates
 yahaan se 11 baar congress ne baaji maari he
 In 1962, 1971, 1977, 1980, 1989 and 1999 only, non-congress candidates won
 congress ke andar bhi 1952 or 1957 main saansad deependra singh hooda ke dada ranbir singh hooda, 1991, 1996, 1998 or 2004 main bhupendra singh hooda saansad chune gaye, jabaki 2005, 2009 or 2014 main deependra hooda saansad bane
 After two tearing in the INLD, the BJP is focusing more on the Rohtak seat
 kyonki agar 2019 main bijepi deependra singh hooda ko haraane main kaamyaab rahi to iskaa sidhaa asar aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke manobal par padegaa
 BJP can make a big and strong face from here
 wo bada cheharaa jat samudaay se ho saktaa he
 a fast search is going on in BJP, whether it is from Bollywood or cricket world
 saansad kaa report card40 saal ke deependra singh hooda 16veen loksabhaa ke dauraan 2014 se ab tak sansad main 51 paricharchaa main hissaa le chuke hai
 Whereas these three times brought private member bills in Lok Sabha
 vahiin apane 5 saal ke kaarykaal main congress saansad ne kul 81 sawaal puche
 History of Rohtak If history is to be believed, Rohtak, formerly called Rohtasgarh (fort of Rohtas), was founded by Rohtas, a Panwar Rajput king
