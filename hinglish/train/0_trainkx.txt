 saujany: newsflicks The Special Monitoring Court on Tuesday dismissed the bail plea of IAS officer Sudhir Kumar, accused in the Bihar State Staff Selection Commission scam
 sudhir kumaar ko 26 farvari ko karmchaaree chayan ayog prashn patr li ghotaale main kathith rup se shaamil hone ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya tha, jiske baad se wo beur jail main band hai
 It is worth mentioning that in February, the Bihar Staff Selection Commission for the government job was to be conducted in four phases and the question papers were leaked on social media before the first two-phase examination
 jiske baad is ghotaale kaa pardaafash hua tha
 Sudhir Kumar, who was the chairman of Bihar State Employees Commission, was given the post of chairman after his arrest
 ab tak is puure maamle main teen darjan se bhi zyada log giraftaar kiye ja chuke hai
 Parmeshwar Ram, secretary of the Staff Selection Commission, who was first arrested in the entire case
 unke mobile ko khangaalane ke baad is baat kaa bhi khulaasa hua ki is puure ghotaale membihar sarkaarake do varisht mantri alok mehta or krishna nandan prasad verma shaamil hai
 Several legislators of the ruling party have also been involved in this scam
 nigaraanee court main sudhir kumaar ke vakil ne daleel di ki unke khilaaf jaanch dal ke paas koi paryaapt sakshya maujuud nahin he or unke faraar hone kii bhi koi sambhaavna nahin he
 On this basis, Sudhir Kumar should be granted bail
 haalanki, sarkari vakil kii daleel thi ki sudhir kumaar ko agar jamaanat di jaati he to wo jail se baahar aane ke baad is puri jaanch ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 After hearing the arguments of both the parties, the Surveillance Court dismissed the bail plea of sudhir Kumar
 aisa lagata he ki vipaksh ne modi sarkaar ko sampradayikta ke mudde par gherne kii taiyaari kar lee he
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi first surrounded the government in the Lok Sabha on this issue
 iske baad mangalvaar ko sonia gandhi ne aarope lagaaya ki modi raaj main sampradayik hinsa badi he
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also made some similar allegations
 unhone kaha ki bijepi soobe kaa sampradayik maahaul bigaad rahi he
 In the midst of all this, there will be a debate on communal violence in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday
 khabar he ki loksabhaa main congress ke netaa mallikarjun khadge or jyotiraditya sindhiya ne mangalvaar ko loksabhaa spikar sumitra mahajan se mulaakaat kii thi
 During this meeting, both of them demanded a discussion on communal violence
 sutron ke mutabik sumitra mahajan ne in netaaon kii maang maan lee he or aaj is par charchaa sambhav he
 The Modi government had just a little over two months to go
 lekin congress use katghare main khadaa karne kaa koi mauka jane nahin dena chaahati
 The weapon of war on BJP is old
 yani sampradayikta failaane kaa aarope
 But now the top leadership of Shan Congress is mounting this weapon
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne kerala ke tiruanantpuram main ek kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'nai sarkaar banane ke 11 hafton ke andar desh main khaskar upi or maharashtra main sampradayik hinsa ke maamle teji se bade hai
 Within a very short time, 600 cases of communal violence have been reported in some other states including UP, Maharashtra
 'isse pehle rahul gandhi bhi sansad main sampradayikta mudda uthaa chuke hai
 The Congress may not have been able to get the post of Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, but the attempt is to send a message to the public to play the role of strong opposition
 yahi vajah he ki sampradayikta par charchaa kii maang ko rahul loksabhaa main saansadon sang wel main utar aae
 The situation is that West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who was once an NDA ally, is also accusing the Modi government of communal violence
 mamata ne bina bijepi or modi kaa naam liye ishaara kiya ki rajya main janmashtami ke dauraan sampradayik maahaul bigaadane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 bjp's allegations of spreading communalism are not new
 mamata hon yaa phir congress or uske sahyogi dal
 All earlier used to try to keep BJP away from power by calling it a communal party
 wo khaas kar modi ko sampradayikta brands kaa aguva qaraar dete rahete the
 Now that Modi is the Prime Minister of the country, it is the effort of the Congress to get a confirmation of its allegations as soon as possible
 khaas kar 4 rajyon main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle
 Perhaps through the debate on communalism in Parliament, the Congress wants to give such a message among the people of the country that what she was saying is towards the end
 lekin asal sawaal ye he ki kya congress janata ko bhi ye yakeen dilaa paaegi ki desh main ho rahi hinsa ke peeche modi sarkaar hi he
 After all, why should the majority government need to spoil the harmony of the country, only the Congress and the accused parties can give a better answer

 When Rahul Gandhi was accusing him of alleged corruption in Rafale, the Bofors case was thrown out by the PM
 aise main ab nigahen is baat par bhi hongi ki congress kis tarah bhaajapa ko is par jawaab detii he
 Rafael Vs Bofors Congress is constantly slamming Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the alleged scam in the Rafale deal calling him a thief and the watchman is a thief

 Modi said that the courtiers of Congress tried to create the image of Mr

 pradhanmantri ke is hamale par congress bifer gai thi or ise ek shahid kaa apmaan bataaya tha
 However, Rahul Gandhi had responded to the Prime Minister and said that no matter how much hate you spread, he will explain it with love to you
 lekin congress is bayaan ke khilaaf chunaav ayog bhi pahunchi or piem kii shikaayat kii, haalanki piem ko chunaav ayog se clin chit bhi mil gai thi

 PM Modi shared an India Today report on Twitter and told in a public meeting that Rajiv Gandhi along with his family, friends and in-laws went for an island vacation on INS Virat
 jisko lekar congress baikfoot par he, is mudde par abhi tak congress ke kisi bade netaa kaa bayaan nahin aayaa he

 ram chandramohan ke saath chhattisgarh ke real estate agent or yogi ke shishy 51 saal ke vijay dhawale or jalandhar sthit enjio international human ritis orgenigeshan ke pramukh 55 saal ke upendra kalsi hai
 In January, the Srivastava brothers filed a petition in the Delhi High Court seeking a stay on the sale of land owned by several societies set up by the Maharishi Group
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki chandramohan or unke sahyogi farji dastavejon ke sahare socity kii jameen par avaidh tareeke se kabja karnaa chaahate hai
 On the other hand, Chandramohan claims that the Srivastava family is selling the Guru's land himself without the approval of all members of the SRM Foundation Board
 iskar vibhaag main march main kii gai ek shikaayat main chandramohan ne ajay shrivastav par aarope lagaaya ki unhone apane ''vyaktigat phaaydon'' ke liye esarem foundation ke karyaalay se bahi-khate or sabhi jameen ke vivaran apane kabje main le liye hai
 Chandramohan has also collected some alleged evidence for this, which shows that the Srivastava brothers have done many land deals without informing the SRM Foundation Board
 unhone kaha ki yah kaam gaiyr kanoonee he kyonki foundation ke paas jo jameen he vah sirf dharmik, shaikshanik or janakalyaan uddeshyon ke liye he
 Chandramohan gave evidence to the Home Ministry and the Income Tax Department in March, confirming his claim
 isamen bataaya gaya he ki esarem foundation kii ek shakha ajay bharat trust ke adhyaksh ambati kri shnamurthi or ajay shrivastav ne hyderabad main ek farji esarem foundation kii sthapana kii he

 The account was closed in July 2011 after withdrawing this amount
 jabaki ajay kaa kahana he ki khud chandramohan ne jameen hathiyaane ke liye jaali dastavej taiyaar kiye hai
 Ajay said, "he took 30 acres out of 175 acres plot in Chhattisgarh with the help of forged documents
 hamane disambar, 2011 main court main yachika daayar kii or hamen ste mil gaya
 "india Today has a copy of the FIR that Ajay had lodged in Bilaspur police station on 16 December

 Ajay said on this, "we had done an agreement (which has also been examined by the court) which was signed before 11 years and it was for sale for less than the current amount
" lihaaja, maine behtareen sauda kiya

 lekin ajay kaa daawa he ki unke paas jameen kii bikri ke liye power of atorni he
 Chandramohan says that Ajay has sold four acres in Chhattisgarh's Rajnandgaon district in 2011
 jab yah sabit ho gaya ki esarem foundation ke board sadasyon se is bare main raay nahin lee gai he to yah bikri nirast kar di gai
 Ajay says that this allegation is false

 Has sold for more than Rs

" ''harshavardhan ko bhi inakam tex vibhaag ke ve vivaran mili hai jinamein pichley do saal main foundation ke vittiya len-dein kii jaankaree he

 He said that the annual turnover of the group was just Rs 25 to 30 crore

 Transcendental meditation yoga classes are also rare as they involve very few people
 '' unhone bataaya ki ashram ke sanchaalan ke liye yogi ke 500 bhakt is colony main rahete hai
 Ajay argues to this that if a part of a building is dilapidated, they cannot do much of it as "huge donations are required for the maintenance of such premises"
 ''bade chandon kaa akaal ho gaya he
 Not only this, the number of such disciples has also become insignificant, which were once filled in the premises to listen to the 'blossoming Guru'

 According to him, 'the government was not sure about whether Bose is alive now or not

 But what reason did Congress have to fear? The country welcomes Bose's return
 lekin shaayad yahi dar kaa kaaran tha
 At that time, Bose was the only charismatic leader who could challenge the Congress in 1957 by uniting the opposition against the Congress
 yah kaha ja saktaa he ki agar bose jinda hote to vah gathbandhan jisane 1977 main congress ko haraaya, vah yah kaam 1962 main hi kar dete, yani 15 saal pehle

 If China attacks us, this air force station will have a much bigger role
 aatankwaadi nepal kii seemaa se ghuskar hamalaa kar sakate hai
 Due to these reasons, security has been increased there

 — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)january 20, 2016 Her teacher has been arrested for raping a six-year-old girl studying in a private school in Tindwari area of banda district
 banda sadar ke police upaadheekshak (sio) omprakash ne ravivaar ko bataaya ki tindwari thana kshetra main ek gaanv ken skool kii kaksha ek main padhane vaali chah saal kii bacchee ke dushkarm ke aarope main shanivaar ko usee skool ke shikshak kishan mishra (24) ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 He quoted the report of the victim's mother's mother on Tahrir as saying that after the school was discharged on Friday evening, the teacher and her younger brother were stopped by the teacher at the school on the pretext of teaching tuition
 usne kuch der baad uske bhai ko gaanv kii dukaan se toffee lene bhej diya or bacchee ke saath kathith rup se dushkarm kiya he
 Omprakash, quoting the complaint lodged, said that when the child's brother returned from the shop to school, he knocked on the door after hearing the cry of the girl inside the toilet, when the accused teacher ran out the door
 ghar pahunch kar bacchee ne puri ghatana apni maa ko bataai
 The accused teacher is said to be a distant relative of the victim
 pichley saal aath november ko kii gai notebandi ke do din baad 2,000 rupee ke nae note bazaar main acchhee khaasi maatra main jari kiye gaye the
 But the 500-rupee note took a long time to arrive, due to which millions of people had to suffer for many days
 kya aapane kabhi sochaa he ki aisa kyon hua?yahaan is mudde se jude ek sheersh adhikari dwaara muhaiyaa karai gai kuch jaankariyaan hai
 When the demonetisation was announced, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had 4 of the new notes of Rs 2,000
 95 lakh karod kaa stock tha, lekin uske paas nae 500 rupee kaa ek bhi note nahin tha
 This note was thought of later
 - desh main note chhapane ke chaar printing press hai
 There are two RBI presses in Mysore (karnataka) and Salboni (west Bengal)
 iske alaava bhartiya pratibhuti mudran tathaa mudra nirmaan nigam li
 (SPMCIL) has two printing presses at Nashik (maharashtra) and Dewas (madhya Pradesh)
 espmasiiel sarkaar kii purna swaamitv vaali company he, jisaki sthapana saal 2006 main note chhapane, sikkon kii dhalaai karne tathaa gaiyr-nyaayik stamp ke mudran ke liye kii gai thi
 - SPMCIL always prints the notes as per the order given by RBI
 lekin is baar espmasiiel ne arabiai ke aadhikarik order ke bina hi noton kii chapai shuru kar di
 Before the demonetisation, the design of the 500-rupee note was only with the Mysore Press of RBI
 - espmasiiel ke devas press main arabiai ke aadhikarik order ke bina november ke duusare hafte main nashik press main november ke chauthe hafte main isaki chapai shuru kar di gai
 Although it was already being printed in the RBI press, it was not able to meet the increased demand due to demonetisation
 - kisi note ko chhapane main saamanyat: 40 din lagate hai, jisamen naidizinke hisaab se kaagaj kii kharid main lagane vaala samay bhi shaamil he
 Due to demonetisation, this period was reduced to 22 days to speed it up
 note kii chapai main lagane vaale kaagaj or syaahi kii kharid duusare deshon se kii jaati he, jiske aane main 30 din lagate hai
 But after the demonetization problem, it was being brought in two days by plane
 arabiai se uske doordaraj ke chest main note le jane main 10-11 din lagate hai, jise helicopter or jahaaj se 1-1
 Shipped in 5 days
 - printing press main note chhapane ke jo kaagaj daale jate hai, vah ucch samvedi sicurity thread se las hota he or 16 din baad chap kar baahar nikalataa he
 - But for the first time, paper made in the country was used to print 500 rupee notes
 yah kaagaj hoshangabad or mysore ke paper mil main viksit kiya gaya
 But their capacity is 12,000 metric tonnes per annum, which is not enough and still requires import
 - 500 rupee ke note chhapane ke liye espmasiiel ke nasik or devas press ne khud kaa banaai hui syaahi kaa istemaal kiya, jabaki arabiai apane press main jo syaahi istemaal karata he, vah duusare deshon se aati he
 - Nashik and Dewas Press's combined ability to print notes 7
 2 arab note salanaa kii he
 Whereas rbi's Mysore and Salboni Press have a combined capacity of printing 16 billion notes annually
 - notebandi ke baad in printing press main kaam karne ke liye raksha mantralay ne 200 log bheje the tathaa in preson ke haal main sevanivrutt hue 100 karmiyon kii bhi madad lee gai
 - MPMCIL has targeted to print 90 crore notes of 500 rupees by December 30
 janvari se yah 30 karod note har maheene chhap rahaa he
 - In RBI and SPMCIL, a 500 rupee note is printed in the ratio of 60 and 40, while a 2000 rupee note is printed only in RBI presses
 - ab aisi khabaren aa rahi hai ki 2000 rupee ke note kii chapai kam kar di gai he or sarkaar ne uski jagah 500 rupee ke note chhapane ke aadesh die hai
 This is the reason that after the demonetisation, people got some relief after the 500 rupee note came in the market till the end of December

 There is a tradition of fighting chickens on the occasion of Makar Sankranti

 Senior BJP leaders LK Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi's last hope of going to Rashtrapati Bhavan is also broken due to Ramnath Kovind's presidential nomination
 adwani or joshi donon yahi ummid paale the ki party khaastaur se narendra modi unako raashtrapati pad kaa ummidavaar tay karvaa denge, lekin aisa hua nahin
 However, when the case of the criminal conspiracy of the Babri structure was tried on advani-joshi, then there were speculations and discussion started in political circles that it is now difficult for advani-joshi to reach Rashtrapati Bhavan
 lekin uske baad bhi donon ke man main yah aas rahi ki ho saktaa he party or modi donon main se kisi ko raashtrapati pad kaa ummidavaar bana den
 Despite all this, there were speculations that Modi can give Advani to Guru Dakshina for the last several days
 bich main media main yah khabaren bhi ai thim ki adwani raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar banaae ja sakate hai
 But as the nomination date came to a close, Murali Manohar Joshi's name began to run, but all the speculations and discussions were put to a halt in the parliamentary board meeting and the party placed bets on its Dalit face and Bihar Governor Ramnath Kovind The NDA surprised everyone by deciding the presidential candidate
 dur-dur tak bhi kisi ke jahan main ram nath kovind ke bare main khyaal nahin tha
 The last hope of both veteran leaders is also broken today
 haalanki 2014 ke chunaav ke baad se hi narendra modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad adwani or joshi kaa party main itnaa mahatv nahin rahaa tha
 Only the guides were limited to the board
 magar yah kahaan ja rahaa tha ki adwani or joshi main se koi naa koi raashtrapati kaa ummidavaar ban saktaa he
 But Modi did not think it appropriate to claim both of them and found a person who neither was in the minds of party leaders nor was there any discussion in the media
 ab jo adwani or joshi ke paas sansad kii sadsyta ke alaava kuch dikh nahi rahaa he, kyonki ek to donon kii umr 80 paar he, doosraa ab koi aisa pad nahin bachaa he, jo donon main se kisi ko diya ja sake
 Given his seniority, party leaders and political analysts agree that it is Advani and Joshi's last innings as mps
 iske baad donon ritred life jienge
 The BJP had kept advani-joshi retired from the party's day-to-day operations only after the 2014 elections, but now the tomodi-amit Shahki duo have retired the advani-joshi duly

 Since the introduction of prohibition in Bihar, liquor smugglers have been engaged in smuggling of liquor in new ways
 isi kadi main police ne 11veen main padhane vaale ek chaatr ko sharaab taskari ke aarope main giraftaar kiya he
 Police has recovered 14 bottles of foreign liquor from a student named Gaurav Kumar from Manpur area of patna
 gaurav gaya ke el
 P
 shahi college main 11 veen kaksha kaa chaatr he
 The police arrested Gaurav from his room, where he lived on rent
 police ne gaurav ke kamare se hi 14 bottle videshishrab baramadki hai
 According to the police, they were informed that the smuggling of liquor has increased in Manpur area and foreign liquor is being transported from house to house
 giraftaar chaatr se poochtacha ke dauraan is baat kaa khulaasa hua ki sharaab taskaron ke ek giroh ke kehane par vah jharkhand se sharaab kharidkar bihar lekar aata tha
 The smugglers used the student so that the police did not suspect him
 gaurav ne police ko bataaya ki har baar jharkhand se sharaab kharidkar bihar laane ke liye use 1500 rupee milte the
 Gaurav used to buy liquor from Jharkhand four times a week and bring it to Bihar
 philhal police aaropee chaatr se taskaron ke bare main padtaal kar rahi he
 Significantly, after the prohibition of liquor in Bihar, the sugar smugglers have become very active
 khaskar bihar se sate duusare rajyon se lagi seemaa par badi maatra main sharaab kii taskari ho rahi he or lagaataar police or aabkaari vibhaag dwaara baari maatra main avaidh sharaab pakadi bhi ja rahi he
 The seat-sharing between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Shiv Sena does not seem to be resolved in view of the Maharashtra Assembly Election
 party sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar siton ke bantwaare ko lekar jald hi ghoshnaa hone kii ummid jataai ja rahi thi lekin donon partiyon main aapasi sahmati na banataa dekh is ghoshnaa ko taal diya gaya
 Amidst all this, BJP President Amit Shah has canceled his proposed tour of Maharashtra
 bhaajapa kii rajya ikai ke sutron ne is baat kii pushti kii ki grih mantri shah kaa guuruuvaar ko hone vaala mumbai daura radd kar diya gaya he
 He said that this would further delay the announcement of seat sharing between the two parties
 bhaajapa ke ek netaa ne kaha ki ummid kii ja rahi thi ki shah guuruuvaar ko apni yatra ke dauraan seat-bantwaare ke formule ko antim rup denge or isaki ghoshnaa karenge
 With his visit canceled, there is no certainty that the alliance will be announced soon
 gauratlab he kisit bantwaare ko lekar chal rahi khinchataan ke bich shivasenasaansad sanjay rautane bada bayaan diya tha
 He told the news agency ANI that Maharashtra Assembly Election is so big, which is 288 seats divided, it is even more terrible than the partition of india-pakistan
 agar ham pehle se hi vipaksh main rahete to aaj halaat kuch or hote
 We will let you know whatever will be decided about the seat sharing between us
 bataa den kishivsena netaa or maharashtra sarkaar main mantri divakar rautake bayaan kaa party ke kaddavar netaa sanjay raut ne samarthan kiya tha
 He had said that if the formula of 50-50 seat sharing formula was decided before Amit Shah and CM, then his statement is not wrong
 chunaav saath ladenge, kyon nahin ladenge
 In fact, Minister Diwakar Raute had said in a media interaction that if the BJP does not give half the seats to the Shiv Sena, then the alliance could break
 vahiin maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa or shivasena ke bich siton ke bantwaare ko lekar fanse pench ko sulajhane ke liye jald hi donon dalon ke sheersh netritv ke bich baatcheet ho sakati he
 Meanwhile, another NDA ally RPI (A) has increased difficulties on this issue by demanding 10 seats
 shivasena maharashtra main asann vidhansabha chunaav main utani hi seat par ladanaa chaahati he jitani par bijepi apane pratyaashee utaaregi
 At the same time, BJP does not want to give equal number of seats to Shiv Sena
 bijepi ke ek netaa ne tark diya tha ki 2014 ke chunaav ke mukaable 2019 ke aam chunaav main party kaa mat pratishat badha he
 Also, the abolition of Article 370 giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir will benefit (the party) from increasing popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 haalanki, party sutron ne bataaya tha ki siton ke bare main donon dalon ke sheersh netaaon ke bich baatcheet ke baad jald rasta nikaal liya jaayegaa
 Ramdas Athawale, president of RPI (A), the constituent of the ruling NDA in Maharashtra, suggested the ally Shiv Sena to accept a formula of 120 to 125 seats
 unhone jor diya tha ki pichley vidhansabha chunaav kii tarah kuch siton ko lekar gathbandhan ko bhent nahin chadhaaya janaa chahie
 Athawale had said that RPI should get at least 10 seats in the Maharashtra Assembly elections and the seats should be divided soon
 aisa anurodh maine bhaajapa ke ucch stareey netritv se hui vaarta main kiya he
 'he had claimed that BJP would be split soon if the seats were split
 
 Shiv Sena
 
 Alliances including RPI are sure to win 240 seats
 gauratlab he ki rajya main vipaksh ke pramukh gathbandhan congress or rashtravaadi congressi party ne siton ke talmail ko antim rup de diya he
 NCP chief Sharad Pawar said a few days ago that Congress and NCP will contest 125-125 seats in the state and 38 seats will be left for smaller allies
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah or shivasena adhyaksh uddhav thakare kii maujuudagi main donon dalon ke bich baraabar baraabar siton par vidhansabha chunaav ladane par sahmati bani thi
 The Shiv Sena wants an agreement on this formula with the BJP

 pichley teen saal main in profeshnals or bank karmiyon kii mehnat se tamaam tarah kii adchane dur kar lee gai hai
 The Bank of Baroda was preparing to take a new flight, now that the government has announced the merger of Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank with it
 haalanki yah raah itani aasaan nahin he
 Announcing the plan, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that this would strengthen banks and increase their lending capacity
 is vilay ke raste main kai chunautiyaan hai
 Let us talk about four such major challenges
 1
 The bank that will be formed after a large-scale challenge will become the second largest bank in the country after the State Bank of India, whose bookkeeping will be around Rs 10 lakh crore
 march, 2017 tak esbiai kaa balance seat 10 lakh karod rupee kaa tha
 These two will be followed by PNB, HDFC and ICICI Bank
 asal main is teji se badalati or digital hoti duniya main bade aakaar kaa koi khaas mahatv nahin he
 Banks will have to focus on faster loan processing, risk management, cost reduction and better returns to shareholders
 2
 The bank formed after the merger will also gain access to South India due to the dual bank of the branch
 haalanki bank of baroda kii pehle se rashtriya pahunch he
 Due to this, there can be duplication in many branches
 teenon bainkon main asset kaa portpholio or portpholio kii quality lagbhag ek jaisi hi he
 However, Dena Bank's position is not good, it has the challenge of higher npas, higher cost of income and falling profits
 isse vilay ke baad bane bank ke munaafe par bhi asar pad saktaa he
 3
 technology integrationvilay ke baad bane bank main technology kaa integration ek bada masalaa he
 Bank of Baroda has recently upgraded its core banking technology from 'finacle 7' to 'finacle 10'
 yah kai maheene tak chalane vaali kavayad thi
 Now bringing all the three banks into this platform is a big challenge
 4
 What will happen to the employees? Bank of Baroda has already started the exercise to change the functioning of the bank by appointing many professionals from outside
 vijaya or dena bank main badi sankhya main senior pojishan par log hai
 The kind of technology and new capabilities that Bank of Baroda has used in loan processing will require people with different and new skills
 isliye donon anya bainkon se aane vaale karmchaariyon ko in kaamon main lagane kii jagah sambhavat: relationships manager, marketing or cells work jaise kaamon main lagaaya jayega

 com / beftfmxsre— Hockey India (@thehockeyindia) December 12, 2018 The Indian team's confidence in the coach is due to the coach's confidence in the pool stage, in which India qualified directly for the knockout by finishing first in the world number three team Belgium
 usne dakshin africa ko 5-0 se haraaya, jabaki canada ko 5-1 se shikast di
 Belgium had to play a 2–2 draw after missing the goal in the last four minutes
 duusari ore netherland ne abhi tak toornament main sabase zyada 18 gol daage hai
 They beat Malaysia 7–0 and Pakistan 5–1 in the pool stage, although they suffered a 1–4 defeat to Germany
 dach coach maiks keldas ne sweekaar kiya ki kalinga stadium par bade match main bharat ko haraana chunauteepurn hoga, lekin kaha ki unhen iskaa anubhav he or khilaadi iske liye taiyaar hai
 The Indian team has improved its record against the Netherlands in the past few years and in the last nine matches, both have won four and been a draw
 vaise vishwa cap main donon tiimon kaa saamana chah baar hua or sabhi chah match netherland ne jite
 Since 1971, India has won the title only once in 1975 and since then its best performance was in 1994 when the team finished fifth, while one of the most successful teams of the tournament, the previous runner-up Netherlands has won three times ( 1973, 1990, 1998)
 chini smartphone company shaomi ne ek nayaa internet broujar Mint Browser launch kiya he
 Android users can download it free from Google Play Store
 Xiaomi ne daawa kiya he ki yah broujar android smartphone ke liye best he
 This browser is less than 10MB and has multi-window support and incognito mode like other browsers
 Xiaomi ke Mint Browser main inbilt dark mod bhi diya gaya he jisase kam raushnee main yuj karne main aasaani hogi
 This browser also has Google voice search i

 The biggest problem of any browser are advertisements and pop ups
 is broujar main multi tasking fitures bhi hai inamen multi teb windo browjing, pinch tu juum function jaise fitures shamali hai
 Apart from this, Incognito mode has also been given
 bharat main is broujar ko zyada lokapriyata mil sakati he
 The biggest reason for this is Xiaomi's reign in the mid-range smartphone market
 kyonki is segment main yusi broujar zyada yuj kiya jaataa he or is broujar kii bhi sidhi takkar yusi broujar se hone kii ummid he

 The main opposition party demanded a thorough investigation to ascertain the source of the money transactions linked to the scam
 bhaajapa pravaktaa nirmala sitaraman ne kaha, ‘congress nit samprag saansadon kii kharid farokht karne kaa prayaas kar rahi thi jabaki ham is maamle main bhandaphod karne waalon ke rup main kaam kar rahe the

 He also questioned why only BJP mps were targeted in this case and sent to Tihar Jail while no action was taken against others including the Congress-led UPA government, the real beneficiary of the scam

 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has described the formation of Fadnavis government in Maharashtra as an accidental oath
 sanjay raut ne 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki bijepi netaa devendra fadanvis ne shapath grahan nahin aparaadh vaala kaam kiya he
 The people of Maharashtra did not get to know only and were sworn in
 shivasena netaa ne kaha ki yah chori he, jise pick poketing kaha jaataa he
 On Ajit Pawar, he said that Ajit Pawar is not a big leader, he grew up in the shadow of Sharad Pawar
 bijepi ne ajit pavaar ko jail bhejne ke bahaane janata se vot maanga tha
 So will Ajith have his office in Arthur Road Jail now? sanjay raut ne kaha kibijepico 30 november tak bahumat sabit karne kaa vakt mila he, is dauraan vah satta, pad or agency kaa durupyog karegi
 Stop speaking the emergency: Sanjay Raut said that BJP people call the Emergency a black day, it should be stopped
 ab desh main har din kaala din ho rahaa he
 Raut also said that if the governor calls us today, we are ready to parade with the entire legislators
 yah baat amit shah ko bhi maaloom he
 Still it is a game of theft

 i myself met the Governor by going to the Raj Bhavan
 meri kuch baaten hui hai
 He had said that he will not take any decision against the constitution but the decisions taken in the last two-four days are not going to give strength to the constitution
 Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena: Ajit Pawar took false documents to Raj Bhawan yesterday & governor accepted those documents
 Even if today, the Governor asks us to prove majority, we can do it right now

 sarkaar or sena ke bich vivaad ke atakalon ke bich pakistani pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani ne aagaah kiya ki unki loktantric sarkaar ko hataane ke liye sajishein rachi ja rahi hai
 With this, Gilani has said that no institution can be like any other system within the system of the country
 unhone kaha ki yah avam ko faisla karnaa he ki ve nirvaachit logon chaahate hai athwa kisi taanashaah ko pasand karte hai
 At an event organized on the birth anniversary of Pakistan's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Geelani said, "I want to make it clear that the conspiracies are being hatched

 He said, i want to tell those people whether we remain in government or in opposition, our fight for the rights of Pakistan will continue
 gilaani ne apni sarkaar or sena ke bich matbhedon ke sandarbh main kaha, koi santhaan ek desh kii vyavastha ke bheetar alag vyavastha nahin ban saktaa
 He said, no one can say that he is not under the government
 is desh kaa har santhaan pradhanmantri ke neeche aata he
 No one can claim to be independent
 agar koi sochataa he ki vah sarkaar ke niyantran se baahar he to vah galat he
 He said, all are under the government and will continue to be under the government as we are elected and elected representatives of the people of Pakistan

 The talk between the two has been coming to light since the Memegot dispute
 abhinayta se netaa bane camel hasan vaise to buudhvaar ko dilli chunaav ayog ke adhikariyon se mulaakaat karne ke liye aae the
 But after reaching the Election Commission, Kamal Haasan also went to meet Rahul Gandhi
 donon ke bich kaaphi der tak baatcheet hui
 After this meeting, Kamal Haasan said that there were informal talks about politics
 maine priyanka gandhi se bhi mulaakaat kii
 The last time i met Rahul Gandhi, there was a desire to meet again from that time
 mulaakaat ke dauraan donon ke chehre par khushi jhalak rahi thi
 At the same time, Rahul said that it is nice to meet Kamal Haasan
 rahul kii maane to camel hasan se mulaakaat ke dauraan kai muddon par gambhirtha se baat hui, donon partiyon kii ranneeti par charchaa hui

 abhinayta se netaa bane hasan ne is mulaakaat ke baad samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki unhen apni party ke sheeghra panjikrut ho jane kii ummid he
 Responding to a question, 63-year-old Haasan said that Election Commission officials told him that his party would be registered soon
 baharhaal, unka kahana tha kichunaav ayogke adhikariyon ne uski koi samay seemaa nahin bataai
 When asked about the party's mark, he said that no decision has been taken on the subject so far and the issue will be discussed within the party before reaching the Election Commission
 bataa den, pichley kuch maheenon se camel hasan congress ke kareeb aate ja rahe hai
 Which is being seen as a new equation in the politics of Tamil Nadu
 vaise rajnikant bhi raajnneetik pari khilne ke liye taiyaar hai lekin unhone abhi tak apane pattey nahin khole hai
 Although bjp's eye is on Rajinikanth, if the party joins Rajinikanth then bjp's hold in Tamil Nadu politics will become stronger
 gauratlab he ki abhinayta camel hasan ne rahul gandhi ko congress adhyaksh kaa padbhaar sanbhaalane par badhai di thi
 Haasan had said that he was confident that Rahul would work and that he deserves respect like his elders

 Maharashtra BJP President Devendra Fadnavis reached Union Minister Nitin Gadkari's house on Thursday
 mulaakaat nagpur main hui
 After the meeting, Gadkari said that Fadnavis had come to meet him as a friend
 'fadanvis hi honge maharashtra ke mukhyamantri'maharashtra main apni bhoomika ke bare main gadakari ne kaha ki wo pehle hi kah chuke hai ki dilli unki pasand he or wo dilli main hi rahenge
 Nitin Gadkari said, 'fadnavis is my colleague
 ham donon ek hi party main hai
 i have brought them into politics
 hamaare bich koi pratispardhaa nahin he, media vaale jis tarah se dikhaate hai, vah galat he
 i have already told that i do not want to return to Maharashtra, i am happy in Delhi
 mujhe is baat kaa dukh he ki media main jis tarah se mukhyamantri res main mere naam kaa istemaal ho rahaa he
 Our party, parliamentary board, PM and party president will take appropriate decision about it
 jahaan tak meraa sawaal he, main kisi res main nahin hum
 Some people want me to handle this post, but i have made it clear that i will follow the party's decision
 'vaise hakeekat yahi he ki maharashtra kii siyasat main nitin gadakari ke badhate ke kad ko kam karne ke liye munde camp ne devendra fadanvis ko aage badhaayaa tha
 Under this strategy, Fadnavis was also made the President of Maharashtra BJP, which was supported by Gopinath Munde
 iske baad se hi fadanvis or gadakari ke bich dooriyaan badhane lageen
 This meeting between the Chief Minister Race is also important because the Gadkari camp does not want Maharashtra's command to be given to Fadnavis
 duusari taraf gadakari ne party alaakaman se saaf kar diya he ki vah dilli kii raajnneeti main bane rahanaa chaahate hai
 In such a situation, the Gadkari camp has also suggested some new names for the post of Chief Minister
 ishaara saaf he ki jab tak party mukhyamantri ke naam kaa elaan nahin kar detii, siyaasi nurakushti aise hi jari rahegi

 hair) onjun 15, 2018 at 4:07 am PDT Let us know that Ranbir Kapoor is busy promoting his upcoming film 'sanju' these days
 film kaa trailor or gane pehle hi viral ho chuke hai
 Now the bus fan is awaiting the release of the film
 sanju main ranbir kii adaakaari kii kaaphi tarif ho rahi he
 Every color of Sanjay Dutt's life is shown in the film
 isse graahakon ko asuvidha ho sakati hapehle jeeyo ne ring time 25 second kiya thisase duusari companiyaan naaraaz thimsio kii tarj par ab airtel or vodaphone idia ne unke network se baahar jane vaali kol par ring time (ghanti bajane kaa samay) 30 second se ghataakar 25 second kar diya he
 One of the steps taken by Airtel and Vodafone Idea is to reduce the cost of interconnect usage charge (IUC) on the time the call is connected
 kya kiya tha jeeyo negauratlab he ki iske pehle mukesh ambani ke netritv vaale reliance group kii company reliance jeeyo ne apane network se jane vaale outgowing kol kaa ring time 20 se badhaakar 25 second kar diya tha, lekin isse bharti airtel or vodaphone idia jaisi duusari companiyon kii naaraazgi dur nahin hui, kyonki ve kam se kam 30 second ring time rakhane kii maang par adi thim
 Telecom companies had warned Airtel recently wrote a letter to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) warning that if Jio's ring time is maintained, other telecom companies can also reduce the ring time to 20 seconds for outgoing calls 
 airtel ne tri se anurodh kiya tha ki vah jeeyo se ring time badhaane ko kahe
 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had unanimously asked the telecom companies to arrive at a solution before reaching any official decision on the interconnect charges
 is masale par tri kii 6 sitambar kii baithak main charchaa kii gai thi
 In this meeting, Airtel, Vodafone Idea, BSNL and MTNL supported the need to have a ring time of at least 30 seconds to answer any call
 haalanki, jeeyo ne kaha tha ki ring time 25 second kaa hona chahie, jeeyo kaa daawa tha ki kisi kol vaale paksh ko jawaab dene ke liye 20 second kaaphi he or zyada samay rakhane kaa matlab spectrum sansaadhan kii barbaadi he
 Customers may be inconvenienced when Jio reduced ring time, while other companies like Airtel argued that reducing the time the phone rings would increase the number of missed calls
 airtel kaa kahana he ki isse jeeyo nirbhar company ko hone vaale aiusi bhugtan main katautee kar sakati he
 However, Jio has denied the allegations, saying that 15-20 seconds is a standard adopted worldwide
 isse kisi vyakti ko kol lagane or saath hi missd kol dekhne ke baad waapas kol karne kii sankhya bhi badhegi
 This will have a bad impact on the customer experience as well as the quality of the network
 isse graahakon ko asuvidha ho sakati he
 What is IUC? Interconnect usage charges (IUC) are paid on services provided by one network to another network
 isamen jis network se kol kii jaati he vah kol pahunchane vaale network ko yah shulk adaa karata he

 Sri Lanka series is an opportunity for the Indian team to test their players under different circumstances
 is siries main kuch aisi ahm kadiyaan hai, jinhen jodne utregi bhartiya team
 The first question is about the role of Pawan Negi
 kya vah jadeja kii jagah spinner olerounder ke taur par khilne ja rahe hai yaa phir dhimi pichon par team ko ek or spinner olerounder kaa vikalp denge
 In such a situation, only one of Hardik and Negi will get a chance in the last 11
 matlab saaf he ki pich agar tej gendbaaji ke anukool he to pandya team kaa hissaa honge or dhimi he to negi team main shaamil kiye jaaenge
 Will Negi be able to retain his quick batting at the international level, it will be clear after this series
 haal hi main khatm hui gharelu tii-20 mushtak ali trophy main negi kaa record shandaar rahaa
 He scored a strike rate of 173 for Delhi
 australia daure par hardik kii gendbaazi to dekh lee he
 He has the speed, but on home pitches he has to catch the rhythm
 saath hi balle se vah bade heater ke taur par mashhoor hai
 His record in Mushtaq Ali this year has been impressive and he emerged as the most successful batsman of the tournament, but can he repeat it at the international level, can he live up to the confidence of captain Dhoni
 yah jawaab is series ke baad hi saaf hoga
 The comments nae khilaadiyon ke lihaaj se hi nahin yuvaraj singh jaise kambek main ke liye bhi yah series behad ahm he
 He did not get much chance in the T20 series against Australia and that old Yuvraj is yet to be seen on the field
 yahaan par yuvi ke paas mauka hoga apane balle se tabadatod paariyaan khel kar aalochakon kaa munh band karne kaa
 This is also important to do because he is an important part of the team's World Cup plan
 ek or khilaadi jiske liye ye series behad ahm he vah hai, ajinkya rahane
 Rahane showed a brilliant game in the IPL, but despite this, captain Dhoni has raised questions about the pace of his runs in the sub-continent
 viraat kohli kii gaiyr-maujuudagi main rahane ke paas ek mauka zarur he captain ko prabhavit karne kaa
 If Team India has good news on all these ends after the third T20 on the 14th, India's claim to the World Cup will be very strong
 aise main antim 11 main hardik or negi main se kisi ek ko hi mauka milegaa
 It is clear that if the pitch is suited to fast bowling, then Pandya will be a part of the team and if it is slow then Negi will be included in the team
 antarrashtriya str par kya negi apni tabadatod ballebaazi barkaraar rakh sakenge, yah is series ke baad saafe ho jayega
 Negi's record in the recently concluded domestic T20 Mushtaq Ali Trophy was excellent
 unhone dilli ke liye 173 kii strike rate se ran banaae
 Hardik has seen the bowling of Australia during the tour
 raftaar unke paas he, lekin gharelu pichon par unhen lay pakadani hogi
 He is also known as a big hitter with the bat
 is saal mushtak ali main unka record shandaar rahaa he or vah toornament ke sabase safal ballebaaz banakar ubhare, lekin antarrashtriya str par kya vah use doharaa sakate hai, kya vah captain dhoni ke bharose par khara utar sakate hai
 This answer will be clear only after this series
 tippaniyan This series is very important not only for the new players but also for the comeback man like Yuvraj Singh
 australia ke khilaaf tii-20 series main unhen zyada mauka nahin mila or us puraane yuvaraj ko maidan par dekhnaa abhi baaki he
 Here Yuvi will have a chance to shut up critics by playing quick innings with his bat
 aisa karnaa isliye bhi zaruri he kyonki vah team ke world cap plan kaa ahm hissaa hai
 Another player for whom this series is very important is Ajinkya Rahane
 ipel main rahane ne shandaar khel dikhaaya, lekin iske baavjood captain dhoni up-mahadweep main unki ranon kii raftaar ko lekar sawaal uthaa chuke hai
 In the absence of Virat Kohli, Rahane definitely has a chance to impress the captain
 14 taarikh ko tisare tii-20 ke baad agar team india ke paas in sabhi chor par acchhee khabaren hon to vishwa cap main bharat kii daavedaari behad majboot hogi
 Will Negi be able to retain his quick batting at the international level, it will be clear after this series

 Madhubani's sweet dialect and painting have their own special identity in Bihar
 yahaan kii kala ne na sirf desh main, balki videshon main bhi shoharat pai he, lekin maujuuda samay main madhubani kii charchaa yahaan kii loksabhaa seat par kabje ko lekar he
 These two parties do not have candidates in Madhubani region, which is considered a stronghold for the Congress and the Left in the Lok Sabha elections
 is mahatvapurn seat par bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke mukaable rashtriya janata dal (ajedy) or janata dal united (jediu) ke pratyaashee chunavi maidan main hai
 The Madhubani parliamentary constituency includes the Harlakhi, Benipatti, Bisfi and Madhubani assembly constituencies and the Keoti and Jale assembly constituencies of Darbhanga district
 varsh 2009 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke hukumdev narayan yadav ne argedy ke abdulbaari siddiki ko parajeet kiya tha, jabaki congress ke shakeel ahamed ko tisare number par santosh karnaa padaa tha
 Earlier in the year 2004 elections, Congress's Shakeel Ahmed defeated bjp's Hukumdev by 87,079 votes
 is chunaav main yah pehla mauka he jab congress ne yahaan se apana ummidavaar nahin khadaa kiya he or vah argedy ko samarthan de rahi he
 Madhubani is considered the traditional seat of Congress
 congress ke pratyaashee ne yahaan chah baar jeet darj kii he, jabaki vamapanthiyon ke kabje main bhi yah seat paanch baar rahi he
 In the 16th Lok Sabha elections, the RJD has once again fielded Abdulbari Siddiqui, while the BJP has expressed confidence in its sitting MP Hukumdev Narayan

 If the candidates of the parties are considered in this election, while Hukumdev is claiming to win his battle with the wave of bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, Siddiqui is trying to avenge the previous defeat of Congress
 Believing on together
 udhar, jediu ke gaus ke paas na keval bihar ke mukhyamantri ke sushasan kaa saath he, balki marxvaadi communist party (makapa) kaa saath hone kaa vishwaas bhi he
 In this election, a total of 11 candidates are trying their luck in the electoral fray, but the main contest is being considered between RJD, JDU and BJP
 16 lakh se zyada matadaataaon vaale is sansadeey kshetra ke jaateey sameekaran par gaur kiya jaae to brahman, muslim or yadav bahul vaale is kshetra main kisi bhi pratyaashee kii jeet ke liye in jatiyon ke matadaataaon kii ahm bhoomika hoti he
 However, if no Brahmin caste candidate is fielded by the main political parties in this region, it will be a matter of which candidate will be inclined towards the Brahmin electorate
 vaise sabhi dal is seat ko apane kabje main karne ke liye edi-chotii kaa jor lagaae hue hai
 The bjp's candidate is strengthening the bjp's hold on the four assembly seats under the Lok Sabha
 yahi kaaran he ki kevati ke vidhayak or hukudev ke bete ashok yadav bhi kehete hai ki modi kii lahar or purv saansad dwaara kiye gaye kaary bijepi kii jeet main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 They say that BJP is getting the support of all castes in Madhubani
 udhar, siddiki bhi apni jeet kaa daawa karte hai
 He only sees the main contest between RJD and BJP
 baharhaal, sabhi pratyaashiyon ko apni-apni jeet kaa bharosa he
 But which party will be able to attract the voters' equation in the name of caste and religion in the region, it will be known only after the election result
 vaise bijepi ke pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar narendra modi madhubani main aakar matadaataaon ko aakarshith karne kii koshish kar chuk hai
 On April 30, voters in Madhubani will vote for their election to the public representative

 Sanjay Raut's statement to you Eid Ul Fitr 2019 Date and Moon News: jab bhi id kii baat hoti he, to sabase pehle zikr aata he id ke chand (eid ka Chand) kaa
 The moon of Eid appears only after the 30th day of Ramadan (ramadan 2019)
 isi chand ko dekhakar id manaai jaati he
 According to Hijri Calendar (islamic Calendar 2019), which is Islamic calendar, Eid comes twice a year
 ek id hoti he id-ul-fitar (2019 Eid Ul Fitr) or duusari ko kaha jaataa he id-ul-juha
 eid-ul-fitr is also called simply Eid
 iske alaava ise mithi id (meethi Eid 2019)bhi kaha jaataa he
 While eid-ul-juha is also known as Bakra Eid 2019
 ab aate hai is sawaal par ki id kis din manaai jaati (eid Kab Hai 2019) he
 So the day Eid's moon is seen, Eid is also celebrated on the same day
 yahi vajah he ki kai baar ek hi desh main alag-alag din id manaai ja sakati he
 Where the moon is seen first, Eid is considered first
 
 
 is baat se yah to saaf hota he ki id or chand ke bich kuch khaas rishta he
 Let me tell you today what is the special connection between Eid and Chand
 
 
 Ramadan 2019 Date in India: kab shuru hoga ramajaan 2019, kab dikhegaa chand? ramajaan ke paak maheene se judi manyataentaid 2019 Date: id-ul-fitar 2019 kab hogi?id-ul-fitar hijri calendar (hijri samvath) ke dasven maheene shavwaal yani shavwaal ul-mukararm kii pehali taarikh ko manaai jaati he
 Now it is also understood that the beginning of Hijri calendar is considered to be a famous historical event of Islam
 vah ghatana he hazarat mohammad dwaara makka shahar se madina kii ore hijaat karne kii yani jab hazarat mohammad ne makka chhod kar madina ke liye kooch kiya tha
 The Hijri calendar which is part of the Hijri calendar is a moon-based calendar
 is calendar main har maheenaa nayaa chand dekhakar hi shuru mana jaataa he
 On the same lines, the month of Shawwal also begins by seeing the 'new moon'
 or hijri calendar ke mutabik ramajaan ke baad aane vaala maheenaa hota he shavwaal
 In such a situation, the month of Ramadan is not considered complete until the first moon of Shawwal is seen
 sone se pehle garm pani pine ke hai kai phaayde, tri karke dekhen When the moon is not seen by Shawwal, it is believed that the month of Ramadan is lacking in completion
 isi vajah se id agle din yaa jab bhi chand najar aae tab manaai jaati he
 Click for more news hijri samvath jis hijri calendar kaa hissaa he vah chand par aadhaarit calendar he
 Every month in this calendar is considered to start by seeing the new moon
 thik isi tarj par shavwaal maheenaa bhi ‘nayaa chand' dekh kar hi shuru hota he
 And according to Hijri calendar, the month after Ramadan is Shawwal
 aise main jab tak shavwaal kaa pehla chand najar nahin aata ramajaan ke maheene ko puraa nahin mana jaataa
 There are many benefits of drinking warm water before bedtime, try it out shavwaal kaa chand najar na aane par mana jaataa he ki ramajaan kaa maheenaa mukammal hone main kami he
 For this reason, Eid is celebrated the next day or whenever the moon is seen

 aap 'da wais of india' ke coach kyon ban gaye?isaki mukhya vajah thi ki yah ek nayaa sho he or iskaa formet bhi alag he
 There were many offers before this, but i did not
 ye meri life kaa teesraa yaa chauthaa reality sho he
 i even went to the jungle once, didn't do Bigg Boss till date, you don't have to fight in The Voice
 nae bachche hai, mujhe nai chijen kaaphi pasand hai
 Who do you consider yourself as 'the Voice of India'? Not one, i have many favorites
 mujeec diarector hai aar di burman, romantic gaanon main kishor da kaa koi jawaab nahin he
 Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan in Sufi Music, Ghulam Ali in Ghazal and Jagjit Singh are my favorites
 parformar ke rup main maaikel jackson sadabahaar hai
 Hip hop songs you sing more, never mind singing slow songs? i have just sung 'dama Dum Mast Kalandar', and soon i will give a tribute to Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan together with Rahat Fateh Ali Khan
 raahat fateh ali khan ke saath mulaakaat ke bare main bataaen
 i have known him since 1998, both of us had entered the industry together
 vaise to wo mere senior hai, lekin mere geet pehle aa gaye the
 After this, the songs sung by him came in the film 'paap'
 bahut hi achche insaan hai wo
 What is the difference between a coach and a competitor? There is a lot of difference, one is that the competitor comes with a lot of preparation
 vah baccha jo aata he uski power vahi he jo meri 1998 main thi
 We all become old age coaches, they can do anything, it is very difficult to decide on that
 bacchon main jo aag hoti he, use sunne main majaa aa jaataa he
 We think we used to be like this too
 singing kii sabase acchhee baat kya he ?mujhe kapil sharma kahata rahata he kii paaji hamen har din kuch na kuch nayaa kamedi main dena hota he lekin aapkaa acha he, ek hi gaanaa baar-baar gaakar paise kama liya karte ho
 So this is the specialty of singing, after a song you start performing
 jab aap us mika ko dekhte hai jo chaay ke bagan main khadey hokar apana pehla gaanaa 'sawan main lag gayi aag' gaata he, to kaisaa lagata he?mujhe aisa lagata tha ki amir nahin bananaa tha, gaadi nahin leni thi, bodygords nahin rakhane the, mujhe ye kuch bhi nahin karnaa tha, jo aaj ho rahaa he, lekin aajkal bacchon ko bada brake chahie
 In those days it was just a matter whether i have to sing on Jagran or in films or albums, just my song should be a hit
 pement kii tension nahin thi bas kaam kaa jajba tha
 Do you think you always want to do something good but there is a contraption? You know the problem is that changing the system is difficult, so i think let it run as it is
 abhi main ek 'dargah' par gaya tha, chup ke ja rahaa tha, phir maine sochaa main kyon chup rahaa hum
 The forehead is to go where millions of people go to apply Ardas from the above, so i decided that it is not right to change the creation of God
 haal hi main aap pakistan gaye the, sho kiya, kya fark he donon deshon main ?koi bhi fark nahin he, maine kaha ki security nahin chahie
 We were four friends, all traveling alone
 ham baba bulle shah or nankana sahab gaye
 Got a lot of love puraa pakistan ghume
 There are still many temples and gurudwaras
 to mujhe koi bhi fark najar nahin aayaa
 You also continued to act in 'balwinder Singh Famous Ho Gaya'? Well, i did this film only to help my producers
 agali baar main nae actors or singrs ko bhi mauka duungaa, acchhee casting karke filmein banaaenge
 Are you close enough to Salman Khan? 1999 i was shooting my songs, Bhumika Chawla, Smriti Irani were all of us on the set
 is dauransalmaan bhaihamaari shooting 3 ghante tak dekhte rahe, to vah meri pehali mulaakaat thi
 Then in 2010 when i sang the bodyguard song, we had a big meeting
 iske baad unase lagaav badhata gaya
 We follow his good work
 vah bahut hi achche or jindadil insaan hai
 Recently singing for Salman? Not yet but whenever he orders, i sing
 khud jaisaa jajba aap kisi singer main dekhte hai?aajkal sabko gaanaa hi gaanaa hota he, apni pahchaan nahin banani hoti, mujhe lagata he logon ko aapaki pahchaan pataa honi chahie, hani singh meraa chela tha or jald hi or gane gaayegaa wo, usamen main khud ko dekh paata hum
 Your warmth is always in the headlines, why do you get so angry? i get very angry, sometimes on the road drivers come, but i control
 kya aapako kisi se dar bhi lagata he?bhagwaan se bahut darataa hum, hameshaa yah dar sataata he ki kahi koi galat kaam na karun
 i try not to hurt anyone because of me

 During this period, action was taken to seal the basement of the shops

 Earlier, at 10:30 am on Tuesday, a special meeting of the Monitoring Committee on illegal construction was held by the Supreme Court on Lodhi Road, in which further strategy was discussed
 iske baad south emsidi ko jaankaree di gai ki mangalvaar ko dephence colony market mencling kii karrawihona he

 However, during the sealing on Tuesday, the traders strongly opposed the corporation's team and the police, due to which the sealing operation had to be stopped for some time, but after this additional security force was called and the sealing action was carried forward
 shaam hote-hote 50 basament ko sil kar diya gaya
 The traders protested the sealing and asked the MCD officials to send at least one notice to them before sealing, so that they could have time to put up their favor or get the goods out
 haalanki ceiling karne aae daste ne is maamle main apni laachaari bataate hue isse inkaar kar diya
 Many traders also appealed to the corporation team to stop the sealing action by showing the receipt of one-time conversion charge, but that too had no effect
 ab mana ja rahaa he ki bhavishya main ceiling kaa dayera or bad saktaa he
 On the other hand, the MCD on this issue is trying to find a solution by meeting the monitoring committee with the central government
 philhal is par koi hal nikalataa najar nahin aa rahaa he

 It is being said that traders are angry with the imposition of 1% excise duty on the jewelery business
 lekin 1% tex itnaa zyada bhi nahin he ki isse kaarobaar par koi khaas fark padataa ho
 If you buy jewelery worth 1 lakh rupees then you will have to pay 1 thousand rupees more

 So many people do not even stop buying jewelry
 jahaan tak kaarobaari kaa sawaal he wo tex ke ye paise graahakon se hi vasuulenge

 desh main jin kaarobaaron main sabase zyada blikemani lagi he, sarrapha kaarobaar unamem se ek mana jaataa he
 To prevent this, the Finance Minister has imposed this tax of 1% on the business of jewelry

 From next year, this limit will be increased to Rs 6 crore
 vitt mantri ne sansad main bharosa diya he ki kaarobaariyon ke yahaan koi inspector nahin jayega or unhen pareshaan nahin hona padegaa
 But the businessmen are not happy despite this much confidence, because they do not want to vote
 shaayad unhen pataa he ki jewelery kaarobaar ek baar tex ke daayre main aa gaya to blike mani kaa puraa kaam band ho jayega
 It has been tried before, during the UPA government's time, the then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee also tried to bring the bullion business under the ambit of excise duty
 tab 21 din chali hadtaal ke baad unhen jhukna padaa tha
 The Central Board of Excise and Customs had justified a 1% tax on the jewelery business, saying that this step is extremely important if black money is to be brought back into the country
 har saal lakhon arabon rupee kaa kaala dhan is kaarobaar main lagaaya ja rahaa he
 What is the plea of traders? Bullion traders say that they will have trouble keeping a record due to the new tax
 zyaadaatar karigar padhe-likhe nahin hai, jisase wo apana hisaab-kitaab nahin rakh paaenge
 This argument is strange because even illiterate people doing other business have to pay tax on their work
 duusari baat ye ki khud vittamantri kah chuke hai ki kaarigaron par yah tex lagu nahin he
 Apart from removing excise duty, businessmen are also angry with the need for PAN card for the purchase of more than 2 lakh jewelery
 mana ja rahaa he ki hadtaal ke peeche kahin na kahin asli kaaran yahi he
 Election enthusiasts are intensifying during the summer season and there is an uproar among all political parties
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi jahaan piem modi ko harsambhav gherne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai vahi piem modi bhi apane humar se chizon ko halkaa karne kii koshish main he
 Recently, a similar scene was seen when PM Modi gave a reference to Avengers and Game on a TV channel about serious allegations of Rahul Gandhi and responded in a funny manner
 gauratlab he ki is sho main rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki narendra modi ne gujarat ke garib logon kii jameen ko ek vyapaaree ko 45 hajaar karod main bech diya he
 Narendra Modi mocked the figures saying that these days i have heard that an Avengers film is going on and i have heard that people from different planets join it in this film
 ho saktaa he ki avengers kaa scriptriter hoga, usne jab duniya ke, brahand ke, sabhi kaa sies kya he, wo aankada unhone apni script ke liye taiyaar kiya hoga or vahi aankada laakar wo shaks inaki (rahul gandhi) toli main aa gaya hoga

 you are true inspirations After a humiliating defeat against England in the Test series, Team India, who started with a win in the T20 series, will also look for a clean sweep by winning the second match against England
 jeet kii lay dobaaraa hasil karne ke baad bharat aasaani se ise nahin ganvaana chahega
 Especially when the much awaited series is to be played against Pakistan immediately after this series
 bharat or pakistan 25 or 28 disambar ko tii-20 match khilne ke baad teen vanade maichon kii siries khelenge
 On the other hand, England, who lost the first T20 match to India in a bilateral series, would like to return home with a win to celebrate Christmas and New Year holidays
 bharat ko is match se pehle gendbaaji or ballebaaji main kuch kamjor kadiyon par mehnat kerani hogi
 Early and last overs in bowling are a matter of concern
 antarrashtriya cricket main padaarpan karne vaale parvinder awana acha pradarshan nahin kar sake jabaki ashok dinda ko short genden phenkane kaa khamiyaja bhugatna padaa
 Dinda later took two wickets but Awana conceded 29 runs in two overs
 is match main bhubaneshwar kumaar yaa abhimanyu mithun ko mauka diya ja saktaa he
 Spinner r Ashwin, who started from the over, also gave away 33 runs while Ravindra Jadeja gave 22 runs in three overs and Piyush Chawla gave away 24 runs
 bich ke overon main haalanki yuvaraj singh ne behtareen gendbaaji karke match england kii pakad se baahar kar diya
 He took three wickets for 19 runs
 england ke captain eyon morgan ne sweekaar kiya ki unki team 15-20 ran peeche rah gai
 Yuvraj, the king of T20 cricket, proved his usefulness with the bat as well, scoring 38 runs in 21 balls
 bharat ne 13 gend shesh rahete match jeet liya
 England also have to improve in many aspects before the second match
 asaram baapu ke paas giraftaar se bachane ke liye ab bas aakhri ek din bachaa he
 If Asaram himself does not appear in front of the police himself till August 30, the fixed period of the Jodhpur police, then assume that he can be arrested anytime after that
 yani giraftaar kii ulti ginati shuru ho chuki he
 Anyway, the police have increased their trouble by refusing to give further concession to Asaram
 police ke is tevar ko dekhte hue asaram ne ab iljaam lagaaya he ki ye sab kuch sonia gandhi ke ishaare par ho rahaa he
 The shivering of the priest of Krishna is missing
 giraftaar ke khoff kaa jowar aa rahaa he
 This is evident in Janmashtami discourses
 dahi handi chhot rahi he
 Sometimes Surat, sometimes Indore, sometimes here and there
 
 
 lagata he asaram ko samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki wo karen to kya karen
 Now there is no time left
 30 agast teji se aa rahaa he
 Asaram went to celebrate Janmashtami at Surat's ashram
 santasang karne
 Dahi Handi Bursting
 satsang to kar liya lekin hadabdaahat main dahi handi bina phode laut aae
 On one side, the police is lying behind
 asaram ko ab ratti bhar bhi vakt dene se inkaar kar rahi he saman ke saath haath dho kar peeche padi he
 The anger of the people is spreading in Asaram's ashrams
 afat har ore se aa rahi he
 Allegations of sexual harassment of a minor have put black stigma on Asaram's white dress
 peedit kaa parivaar asaram ko faansee maang rahaa he
 Seeking justice for the crime with the daughter
 abhi tak asaram khule gum rahe hai
 Traveling from Jodhpur to Surat and from Surat to Indore Till yesterday, the wind of the government and police was bad in the name of Hari but now the wind is bad for Bawali Baba
 asaram ne giraftaar se bachane ke apane saare ghode khol die
 Made police wait for hours to get summons
 lekin ab ulti ginati chal rahi he
 Now Bawali Baba is fluttering like a lamp before it is extinguished
 kalank keechad se asaram san chuke hai
 The truth of Asaram sitting on the mountain of the tree is probably in front of the era
 bhakthi ke mandap main charitra ke keechad ko chalbaaji ke jis chole se baba ne dhak rakhaa tha
 The tornado of infamy has left her devastated
 or ab giraftaar kaa count down shuru ho gaya he
 Asaram, who teaches people virtue and patience, is on the seventh sky of anger these days
 kasate kanoonee shikanje or siyaasi hamale se baukhalaaye asaram kabhi gunaah sabit karanevaale ko lakhon rupye ke inaam kaa elaan karte hai, to kabhi apane khilaaf shikaayat karanevaali ladki ko saazish kaa mohara qaraar dete hai
 But now the bet Asaram has played is more than all the bets
 daanv sonia or rahul par sidhe hamale kaa
 There is a very old saying
 khisiani billi khambha noche
 Bawali Baba nowadays does not understand what to do
 kya bolen bas munh main jo aata he bak jate hai, jo man main aayaa ool julul bol jate hai
 Now Congress is crying and raging on Baba
 or baba kah rahe hai ki unke khilaaf saazish ho rahi he
 Baba went on speaking in Bhopal
 lekin peeche chingaari chhod gaye
 The truth is that the Congress was still playing hide and seek on Asaram, but now the statement of Bawali Baba is poisoning the party with the arrow of poison
 baba par bavandar to pehle bhi machaa he, lekin is baar naaballig ladki ne asaram par yon shoshan kaa aarope darj karaayaa he, ab kya sadhu, kya sant, kya netaa, kya janata sab asaram par pil pad hai
 a saint had given such a shock to virtue
 sansad ko sochna pad gaya
 a minor girl told the police that the pain of Asaram's wounds is not forgotten
 ab tamaam party ek taraf hai or bijepi asaram ke pratap main pigal rahi he
 Asaram is being discussed in Parliament, on the street, in the streets of the city
 yon shoshan ke aarope se baba bhadak rahe hai
 Moreover, Asaram misbehaved with Aaj Tak's team in an airplane going from Mumbai to Surat
 jo asaram ab tak budtamiji par utar rahe the
 Were furious with the media
 ab giraftaar count down shuru hua, to kal tak asaram kii shishyaa ek vishesh samudaay ke bare main jo kuch kah rahi thi, us par baba safai dene lage
 Now Asaram is repeatedly invoking the world, he is telling the world, he is innocent, he is ready to go to jail, but there is a conspiracy against him, he is saying, those who prove the charges will give the reward, that too Of five lakhs
 sadak se sansad tak uthaa bavaal or ab 30 agast tak kaa ultimatum ye bataane ke liye kaaphi he ki kanoon se bada koi nahin he
 Not even Asaram
 kehete hai jab museebataan aati hai, to chaaron taraf se aati hai
 Asaram's situation is exactly the same these days
 abhi asaram jodhpur main apane khilaaf darj yon shoshan ke maamle se bachane kii jugat hi laga rahe hai ki unke khilaaf do or shikayaton ne musiibat badha di he
 The first complaint is of a family whose son went missing in Asaram's ashram, while the second complaint was of a second girl who was sexually assaulted by Asaram
 asaram ke ashramon par ek ke baad ek badanaami kaa kalank lag rahaa he
 The family of Digambar Maske had relied on the face of Asaram, this god
 is parivaar kaa iklauta chiraag asaram ke ashram main gaya tha, lekin ajtak nahin lautaa
 11 years have passed
 lekin is parivaar kaa chiraag nahin lautaa
 Digambar Maske, a resident of Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh, has 3 daughters and a son Pramod Maske
 digambar chhindwara ke gulabra main rahane vaale shiksha vibhaag main accountint he
 The Maske family alleges that Asaram has done some magic against his son, due to which his son did not return
 2 bahanon kii shaadi ho gai, or choti bahan har saal raakhi ke liye bhai kaa intjaar karti he
 The family is afraid that they may lose their beloved
 aaropon ke daldal main dhanse asaram par ek sangeen aarope ek anya ladki bhi lagaati he
 When Asaram reached Raipur 9 years ago for satsang, this girl along with her parents also went to take Asaram's blessings
 lekin ladkee kaa aarope he ki asaram ne usase chhedchhad kii thi
 At that time, that minor girl was left drinking a sip of blood in fear
 lekin jodhpur ghatana ke baad uskaa dard ubhar aayaa he
 When he narrated his incident to some women's organizations in Chhattisgarh, everything was exposed
 asaram apane raipur ke ashraam main salanaa chah se aath baar satsang ke liye aate hai
 Obviously, the allegations against him may make his path even more difficult
 asaram ek, iljaam hajaar
 
 
 Even if there was a single blemish of stigma on Asaram's white dress, it was a privilege
 lekin ab to iljaamon ke chalate puraa kaa puraa safed chola hi kaala dikhne laga he
 And this soot includes sexual abuse, vandalism, hypnosis, kidnapping and all crimes
 asaram baapu par naaballig se balaatkaar kaa aarope laga he, or wo giraftaar nahin hue
 This is not the first time, Asaram was not even arrested for witchcraft
 bachche mar gaye lekin police ne nahin chuaa
 It seems that the law has placed a stone on the heart
 kya sant ke chole se police bhi do kadam peeche hatati he
 In July 2008, when the bodies of two innocent children studying in Asaram's Ahmedabad ashram were found in the ashram flowing along the ashram, after the mysterious deaths of 11-year-old Dinesh Vaghela and 10-year-old Abhishek Vaghela, the family members held Asaram's ashram responsible
 
 yahaan tak police ne bhi apane halafnaamein main ashram main chalane vaale kaale jaadu or duusari rahasyamayi karstaniyon kaa khulaasa kiya tha
 Asaram's hair also did not go unpunished, does it happen in the saint's ashram
 kya sant par kaale jaadu kaa aarope lagata he
 On 30 July 2008, the body of a four and a half year old child was found in Asaram's Gurukul in Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh
 iske baad hadakamp machaa
 The ruckus occurred as the corpse was found in the ashram's bathroom
 iske baad police ne is maamle main gurukul ke hi nauveen class mempadhane vaale bachche ko pakadaa, jiskaa kahana tha ki wo kisi bhi haal main ashram kii kaid se aaazaad hona chahta he
 Asaram's ashram was battered
 phir bhi kya, asaram sant hai
 In the month of December 2009, Asaram Bapu had created a sensation by his former devotee Raju Chandok accusing him of trying to kill him
 vaardaat tab hui thi, jab raju ek raat bike se apane ghar laut rahe the or andhere main do logon ne hatya ke iraade se un par goli chalaa di thi
 The Gujarat police had also named Asaram in the case
 phir bhi wo sant hai
 After wearing the costume of faith, he is sitting as a spiritual master
 tamaam vivaadon or aaropon ke baad bhi kya asaram ko sant kahalaane kaa haq he
 Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin became the seventh bowler to take five or more wickets in the innings in India's debut match, taking six wickets in lieu of 47 runs in the second innings of the West Indies
 aswin subah se carabian ballebaajon par haaavee ho gayi or unhone subah ke satr main do wicket lene ke baad duusare satr main bhi baaki bache teenon wicket liye
 Ashwin took his first wicket on the second day of the match
 is tarah se vah match main 128 ran dekar nau wicket lene main safal rahe jo ki bharat kii taraf se padaarpan match main doosraa sarvshereshth pradarshan he
 The record is named after Narendra Hirwani, who holds a world record of 16 wickets for 136 runs
 dilachasp tathy yah he ki bharat kii taraf se ab tak jin saat gendbaajon ne apane padaarpan test match main pari main paanch yaa isse adhik wicket lene kaa karnama kiya he unamem paanch spinner shaamil hai
 First of all, this achievement was achieved by Mohammad Nisar in India's first Test match
 unhone england ke khilaaf 25 june 1932 se shuru hue is match kii pehali pari main 93 ran dekar paanch wicket liye the
 Leg-spinner Vaman Kumar was the second bowler to achieve this feat
 sanyog se unhone firozshah kotla maidan par hi yah ricard banaaya tha
 Vaman took five wickets for 64 runs against Pakistan in 1961
 madhyam gati ke gendbaaj aabid ali ne 1967 main austrailia ke khilaaf edilade main 55 ran ke evaj main chah wicket lekar is suchi main apana naam likhvaya
 The leg-spinner took 16 wickets in the debut match against West Indies, which is still a record
 unhone pehali pari main 61 ran dekar aath or duusari pari main 75 ran dekar aath wicket liye the
 Leg-spinner Amit Mishra showed this feat before Ashwin
 unhone australia ke khilaaf 2008 main mohali main 64 ran dekar paanch wicket hasil kiye the
 Ashwin took the fifth wicket of the innings by dismissing Caribbean captain Darren Sammy and took the sixth wicket in the form of Ravi Rampal
 is tarah se unhone bharat kii taraf se padaarpan match main ek pari main teesraa sarvshereshth pradarshan kiya
 Both the first records are named after Hirwani

 Actually, Rahman Malik tagged PM Modi and United Nations on a Twitter post, wrote, "you are the leader of your country who is saying all this about the violence in Kashmir, listen to them
" " lekin is twit main wo badi galati kar baithe
 He tagged UNO Games instead of United Nations

 khataron se khelnaa unki aadat rahi he
 Whether it was to set a world record by traveling in a hot air balloon at the age of 67, or a solo trip from England to India in 1998 by a microlight aircraft, Raymond Chairman Emeritus Vijaypat Singhania never got nervous
 lekin aaj 78 saal kii umr main bharat ke sabase bade paridhaan brandon main se ek kaa maalik paariwarik vivaad ke chalate baichaiyn or pareshaan he
 His kayak is immersed where there was less water
 khud unke chote bete gautam singhania is vivaad ke centre main hai, jo 5,000 karod ru
 The company has a new chairman and managing director with a turnover of over Rs
 nabbe saal puraani is company ke chairman kaa pad vijaypat ne 2015 main chhodkar kaman apane bete gautam ke haath main de di thi
 He is now in the shelter of the Bombay High Court
 maamla mumbai ke brich candi ilaake main sthit 37 manjila jeke house main ek duplex flats par kabje se judaa he
 The JK House has been the property of Raymond since 1945
 iskaa 2007 main punarvikas kaary shuru kiya gaya tha jab company, pashmina holdings (remand kii ek anushanbee jisane company se lij par jeke house liya hua tha) or imaarat ke paanch duplex flaton main se chaar main us vakt rahane vaale kiraayedaaron ke bich tripaksheeya samjhauta kiya gaya tha
 The four included Vijaypat Singhania, Veenadevi (wife of Ajaypat, the dead brother of Vijaypat), his sons Anant and Akshaypat and Gautam
 vinadevi or unke beton ne makaan ke malikane ke sambandh main hycourt main sanyukt yachika daayar kii he jabaki vijaypat ne ek punarviksit flats par malikane kii swatantra yachika daali he
 The root of the dispute starts from here
 punarvikas ke liye jab imaarat ko saunpa gaya tha (tab 14 manjila), us vakt develper or kiraayedaaron ke bich samjhauta yah hua tha ki nai imaarat main unhen 9,000 rupye prati varg foot ke bhugtan par 5,185 varg foot kaa duplex diya jayega
 This rate was then based on the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation rates
 jab 2016 main flats banakar taiyaar hue, tab tak ye dar ek lakh rupye prati varg foot ke paar ja chuki thi, aisa remand ke andruni sutron kaa kahana he
 Hence, the company would have suffered a lot of loss (estimated at around Rs 650 crore) by giving houses to tenants at old rates
 masalaa korporate gavarnence se aage kaa tha jahaan parijanon ko company kii kisi sampatti main bazaar mulya se 90 fisadi se bhi kam laagat par aavanton diya janaa tha
 Raymond put the original proposal before the company board, which decided to take the matter to shareholders
 june main shairdharakon ne is kadam ko khaarij kar diya or prastaav ke khilaaf 97 fisadi vot pade
 This decision disappointed the family of Vijaypat and his brother
 vijaypat ne 1980 ke baad se company kii kaman sambhalate hue use varsted fabric or suiting ke kshetra main agrani banaaya or bazaar par 60 fisadi kabja dilaayaa tha
 He feels that Gautam unnecessarily raised issues that could be addressed only at the board level and the shareholders' meeting
 is tarah unhen apane daawey vaale makaan se unka adhikaar jaataa rahaa
 His son has shown him the back which he paid to Raymond for Rs 1,000 crore
 se zyada mulya ke baraabar 37 fisadi hissaa saunpa tha
 He says, "I think i am right and i have a right to the property i am fighting for
 hamaare bich kanoonee samjhauta he lekin gautam pair peeche khinch rahaa he
 He wants to insult the agreement
 '' is bich unhone saaf kiya ki khud ko banaae rakhane ke liye unke paas paryaapt paisa he or betaa unhen khaane ko mohataaj nahin kar saktaa
 Gautam, 51, is a passionate racer and is the first driver from India to win the 2015 Ferrari Challenge Europe Championship
 ve maanate hai ki remand company ke chairman or vijaypat ke putr ke bataur unki jimmedaariyaan or bhoomikaayen alag-alag hai
 "all the necessary facts were put before the shareholders for consideration," he says
 unhone tripaksheeya samjhaute ko khaarij kar diya
 Gautam had made a public statement that if he had to vote, he would have voted against the proposal in the interest of shareholders and the company
 unhone kaha tha, ''shairdharak kaa hit sarvopari hota he or paariwarik hiton ke upar hota he
 i welcome his decision in this regard
 ''remand aitihaasik jeke group kaa hissaa tha jise 1918 main lala jaggilaal or lala kamalaapat singhania ne sthapit kiya tha
 It was the third largest trading empire in India after Tata and Birla, which was later divided into three parts, headed by Gaur Hari Singhania in Kanpur, Hari Shankar Singhania in Delhi and Vijaypat in Mumbai, owned by Raymond
 
 vijaypat keval is baat se khinn nahin hai ki bete ne jabaan nahin rakhi
 Another war started in 2015 when he gifted his share to Gautam (which he regrets today)
 vijaypat ke teen potiyaan or ek pota paariwarik sampatti main hissedari kaa daawa karne adaalat chale gaye
 These four are the children of Vijaypat's elder son Madhupati Singhania who has settled in Singapore
 in chaaron ne bombai hycourt main apane dada or remand par mukadmaa thok diya ki unke paitruk adhikaron ko manmarjee se kisi ko saunp dene kaa adhikaar unke paas nahin he
 He challenged an agreement made by Madhupati and his wife Anuradha in December 1998 as part of a family split in which the couple relinquished their own and their children's stake in other assets, including Raymond's empire
 reporton ke mutabik, ye chaaron bachche-ananyaa, rasalika, tarini or raivathari-daawa karte hai ki unhen is samjhaute ke bare main tab pataa chalaa jab inamen sabase chote kii umr 18 saal kii hui
 People within Raymond say the court rejected the petition because the petition was not filed within a year of being 18 years old
 adaalat ne singapore main madhupati kii ayyash jeevanstyli kaa bhi sangyaan liya, jisamen unki 45,000 dollar kii nauka par bhi tippanee kii
 Tenants moved into tenement houses in the city while the work was going on at JK House
 akele vijaypat juhu main apane paitruk makaan kamala cottage main rahane chale gaye
 In 2015, Madhupati complained to the Bombay High Court that her father was not complying with the 2008 Arbitration Order on Kamala Cottage and hence he would have to vacate it
 iske baad vijaypat brich candi ke grand parade main ek duplex main kiraaye par rahane chale gaye
 They have claimed rent of 7 lakhs per month for this house on Raymond on which the company has to take a decision
 remand ke ek varisht adhikari kehete hen, ''maamla adaalat main he, jo bhi faisla hoga, ham use maanenge
 "gautam lives in a duplex house inside JK House
" company ke sutara bataate hai ki ve apane vetan main echaare par daawey ke badale vahaan rah rahe hai
 The petitioners have also challenged this
 agali sunwaayee 22 agast kii he
 The question is, why did Vijaypat gifted the property to the younger son and brought himself into a situation where he was also having to fight a court battle for rent? Even though Gautam became MD in 1999 (soon after the family split), he has been able to take important decisions of the company only after Vijaypat's transfer in 2015
 gautam kah chuke hai ki ve shshpita or parivaar ke saath lagaataar samvaad main hai
 "my side in the court is strong," says Vijaypat
 ho saktaa he ki maamla arbitreshan main chalaa jaae
 Wait
 '' baharhaal, vivaad se company kii pragati par asar pad saktaa he
 On one hand, the Modi government has clearly told Pakistan that talks between the two countries will not only be held on Kashmir, but on Kashmir as a whole
 vahiin, piemo main rajyamantri jitendra singh ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki raashtra ne sankalp kiya he ki ham paak adhikrut kashmir ko swatantra karavaaenge or vahaan tirangaa fahraayenge
 Here is the key part of Jitendra Singh's conversation with Aaj Tak- When are you getting pok independent and hoisting the flag there? Jitendra Singh - See, as soon as POK is free, the flag of India will be hoisted there
 yah sankalp naa sirf bhartiya samaaj kaa he, balki yah raashtra kaa he
 It also belongs to the House
 sawaal- pioke ko swatantra karwaane ke liye kya prayaas shuru kar die hai aapane?jitendra singh-yah prayaas alag-alag str par rahete hai
 But resolution is necessary
 sankalp kaa aage chalakar samaadhaan bhi hota he
 There is determination and dedication
 sawaal- ab kya kashmir par nahin pioke par baat hogi?jitendra singh-jaisaa ki us din pradhanmantri ji ne bhi kaha, jab ham jammu-kashmir kii baat karte hai to hamen ek baat dhyaan rakhni hogi
 Jammu and Kashmir has three main parts, primarily and fundamentally
 jammu ladakh kashmir,pakistandhikrut hissaa or gilgit-balatistan
 Without talking about these parts, talking about Jammu and Kashmir remains incomplete
 sawaal- kya tevar main fark he, kuch aakraamak ho gaye hai
 With India's attitude towards Pakistan, about pok, about Bluechistan, what are going to be more aggressive in the coming days? Jitendra Singh - i would not say whether they have become aggressive or are going to happen
 lekin yah vidambnaa thi ki 1994 main jo bhartiya sansad main sarvasammati se prastaav paarit kiya tha or congress party ke netritv kii sarkaar thi usne or use uske baad kii sarkaron ne darkinar kar diya uski avhelnaa kii
 Even after that, the Congress Party remained governments
 lekin 22 saal baad praayshchit karne kii jimmedaari bhartiya janata party or uske netritv vaali modi sarkaar kii ai he
 The District Sessions Court in Kerala on Friday rejected the bail plea of a Muslim youth who did not stand in the cinema hall during the National Anthem
 25 saal ke em salmaan par ipisi kii dhara 124 e ke tahat raashtragan ke dauraan baithe rahane or hooting karne kaa maamla darj hua he
 Section 66A has also been imposed under IT Act for making derogatory comments on Facebook for the National Flag
 salmaan do hafton se jail main band he
 While rejecting Salman's bail plea, the court said that Salman's conduct is anti-national and his crime is more serious than murder
 salmaan ke alaava paanch anya logon par bhi rajdroh kaa cese darj he, jinamein do mahilaayein bhi hai
 One of them has also got anticipatory bail
 aapako bataa den ki kerala main rajya ke swaamitv vaale theatre main har film se pehle raashtragan chalaaya jaataa he or darshakon ko khadey hone ke liye bolaa jaataa he
 Salman and his friends went to see the film in one such theater and did not stand during the national anthem
 vahaan baithe darshakon ke ek samooh ko yah bilkul thik nahin laga or usne is baat kaa virodh kiya
 Harihar Sharma, who was granted anticipatory bail, said, "some people questioned our reluctance not to stand during the National Anthem at the theater and asked us to go to Pakistan
" wo hamase uljhe or bahes kii
 Not only this, they also encouraged us by making some wrong comments
 ' sharma ne bataaya ki in logon ne phir police ko jaakar shikaayat kii, isi main salmaan bhi rashtradhvaj par aapattijanak tippanee karne ke liye pakadaa gaya
 Harihar said, 'on 20 August, the police arrested all of us
 ham sab ghar se dur rahete hai or hamen dar tha ki police kahin hamen raashtra virdohi sanghathan se judaa hua na samajhe
 BRP Bhaskar, chairman of Justice for Salman Forum, said, 'charges have been fabricated against Salman
 centre ne kaha he ki saarvajanik sthanon par raashtragan chalaanaa jaruri nahin he or agar chalata bhi he to khadaa hona jaruri nahin he
 It is wrong to impose criminal clauses for this
 ' Earlier a similar video was being shared in which a Kerala teacher sang a song of Bhulaiya at the brother's wedding
 jisko bhi kaaphi shares mili the

 Aviation regulatory agency director general of civil aviation (DGCA) suspended two spicejet pilots for a year on Saturday
 in donon ko vimaan ko mumbai hawaondde par sahi dhang se nahin utaarne ke kaaran nilambit kiya gaya he
 On July 2, the B737 aircraft, which flew from Coimbatore to Mumbai, touched the ground far ahead of the runway against the scheduled point while landing at the Mumbai airport, forcing the aircraft to overtake the halting runway
 sutron ne pitiai bhashaa ko bataaya ki dijisie ne paaya ki do july 2019 ko captain karan gujral or captain arpit gandhi dwaara udayi ja rahi spicejet kii coimbatore- mumbai udaan ne hawaondde par ranve ko uske shuruaati bindu se aage 4,462 foot par chuaa jiske parinamswaroop vimaan ranve par rukne ke bajaay aage nikal gaya

 PM Modi said that the results of the Lok Sabha elections showed that the people of the country think for the good of the country rather than themselves, this thinking is worth praising
 piem modi ne apatkaal kaa zikr karte hue phir congress par nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki aaj 25 june he
 On the date of 25 June, the soul of the country was crushed
 apatkaal kisne thopa tha
 Can we forget the dark day on that day
 piem modi ne kaha ki bharat main loktantr samvidhan ke pannon se paidaa nahin hua he, balki bharat main loktantr sadiyon se hamaari aatma he, us aatma ko kuchal diya gaya tha
 Our dream is not to be elevated but to connect with the roots, to be deeply rooted
 jadon se hi takat paakar desh ko or oonchai dena, ye hi hamaara rasta he
 PM Modi said that i am probably the first Prime Minister who has told the Red Fort that all the governments that have been held since independence in the country and the state have contributed to take the country forward
 is sadan main pehle bhi ye baat main kah chukaa hum or aaj bhi is baat ko doharaa rahaa hum
 He said that i challenge that from 2004 to 2014, people sitting in governance should have praised Atal ji's government
 unki chhodon narsimha raav ji kii sarkaar kii tarif kii ho
 While sitting in this house, these people did not even mention Manmohan Singh's government even once, if they did, then tell me
 piem modi ne kaha ki hamen sunaane kaa haq unheen ko he, jinhone kisi ko sweekaar kiya ho
 Otherwise, Narasimha Rao would get Bharat Ratna during his tenure, Manmohan Singh would get Bharat Ratna, but he cannot think of anyone outside the family

 captain amarinder singh nahin chaahate hai ki sarkaar banane ke saath kisi bhi party netaa ko koi naaraazgi rahe
 For this reason, the sharing of ministries is being done carefully and it is also being said that once the government is formed, the cabinet will be expanded soon

Doctor Abhishek of Nanavati hospital called for examination of Devoleena i went
 doctor ne sweekaar kiya ki sho se unhen devolina ke chekup ke liye contact kiya gaya tha
 The doctor said, i asked him to call me when the problem was more, but after that no call was made to me, so now i think his health may have recovered and Devolina is all right now
 khayr, ab agar ghar main devolina kii baat karen to unki ghar main yatra kaaphi alag rahi he
 She is also homeless once, but was later re-entered through a wildcard
 is hafte bhi sho main kuch mazaakia andaaj se devolina or aarti singh ko beghar karne kii ghoshnaa hui thi
 However this was just a joke and this week only Khesari Lal Yadav was out
 devolina pichley dinon siddharth ke saath flert karti hui bhi najar ai thim
 This special style of Devolina was well liked by the audience
 bhishma pitamah apana aakhri astr pehle hi kharch kar chuke hai or maujuuda dalnayak ne ab jaakar apni pehali chaal chali he
 And it was seen in this trick that the future of BJP will now be equipped with the dreams of whose eyes
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri or bijepi kii campan cameti ke chairman narendra modi ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye apni team kaa elaan kar diya he
 What Advani camp and other camps in this team have all been shown to be cheating
 sirf vahi jagah bana paae hai, jo modi ke khaas hai yaa pichley kuch maheenon main unki good book main shaamil hone main safal hue hai
 The Sangh quota has also kept the same names with which Modi has the right equation
 suresh soni jaise sangh pratinidhi jo apana agenda haashie par nahin balki saamne lekar chalate hai, kinare laga die gaye hai
 Party President Rajnath Singh's unanimous support has been given to his representative Sudhanshu Mittal
 modi kii yah team unki chunavi ranneeti kii taraf bhi ishaara karti he
 It is mostly people who are either young, fire brand or have been doing intellectual work behind the scenes
 is team kii pehali meeting 4 july ko hogi
 Before speaking on this team, a look at its members: Narendra Modi (chairman), Amit Shah, Varun Gandhi, Rajiv Pratap Rudy
 mukhtaar abbaas nakvi, dharmendra pradhan, sudhanshu mittal, muralidhar raav or ram laal
 Even here, Chhaya Amit Shah's mood now consider his utility one by one
 amit shah modi ke point main hai
 To understand this, there was no need to search for his name in this committee
 gujarat ke grih rajya mantri rahe amit shah ke haath se satta kya chhuti, vah sanghathan main or taqatvar hokar ubhare
 In the current team of Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah as Modi Man was directly included as General Secretary
 party itihaas ke jaankaar bataate hai ki pehle kabhi kisi ko itnaa bada pramotion nahin diya gaya
 But in the next breath we also remember the name of Nitin Gadkari
 gadakari party ke rashtriya adhyaksh banane se pehle hameshaa maharashtra str ke netaa rahe the
 But then it was argued that if the Sangh has a hand, it becomes a celebrity
 kuch hi barason main naare ne nayaa arth or naam paaya
 If Modi has a hand, then it is decided to become a celebrity, at least in the BJP organization
 baat karen shah kii, to vah limlite se dur upi ke daure main vyast hai
 His first job is to take stock of almost every Lok Sabha constituency where the BJP has won ever since 1989
 uske baad puraane party kaaryakartaaon, vidhayakon or duusare nishthavan netaaon se baat kar modi ke liye feedback taiyaar karnaa
 It is being said that this time neither Sangh will run in ticket distribution in UP nor Rajnath nor Tandon, nor will the leaders of Hawaii like Kalraj
 vaise survey kaa jor pichhali vidhansabha main bhi tha, magar aakhir main vah bas shor hi sabit hua or tikat guton ke hisaab se edjust kiye gaye
 But Shah has been clearly told that when Modi himself is contesting from UP, the seats should be at least three times
 is samay rajya main bijepi ke paas mahaj 10 siten hai
 Apart from the place of Varun and Naqvi from UP, Varun Gandhi is another leader from UP
 pilibhit se saansad varun gandhi soobe main ab tak sirf aakraamak hindu netaa kii chhavi hi bana paae hai
 At a time when Modi wants to present his Liberal image, Varun's visit will help polarize Hindu votes against Muslims in Purvanchal belt in the Terai and Nepal
 iske alaava long turm investment kii tarah bhi dekha ja rahaa he modi kii team main varun ko
 Team Modi feels that the current leaders of UP are already there and they do not have the ability to take on Mayawati and Akhilesh
 aise main jarurat ek yuva netritv ko viksit karne kii he, jiske paas paariwarik viraasat bhi ho or tikhe tevar bhi
 Apart from Tvar, Kalevar is also special in politics
 isiilie campan cameti main rampur ke netaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ko rakhaa gaya he
 In the BJP, only two Muslim faces emerged after Sikander Bakht, Naqvi and Shahnawaz Hussain
 shuruyaat main nakvi kii patavaar jhumi, magar phir vah saansad or party pravaktaa se upar nahin ja paae
 At the same time, Shahnawaz was also successful in getting the post of minister during the Atal government
 baharhaal hossain kii galati yah rahi ki unki ginati adwani ke priy logon main kii jaati he
 As a result, the committee on minority affairs was also given to Naqvi and now the Muslim quota was fulfilled from him in the campaign committee too
 yuva cote se rudi or pradhan bhi aerajeev pratah rudi chhapra ke netaa hai or chunavi haar jeet donon chakh chuke hai
 He was the Minister of Civil Aviation in the Atal Government, but could not do anything special
 pichley kuch barason se unka nirvaasan hi chal rahaa tha
 Occasionally, he would appear on TV just as a spokesman
 magar modi kaa prabhutv badhate hi unke sitare chamakane lage hai
 It is believed that Modi will be the second most important state after Bihar in terms of strategy and numbers
 yani unki team ke feedback ke hisaab se hi pratyaashee tay honge or chunavi ganit banegi
 Dharmendra Pradhan is the leader of Orissa and used to hold the Yuva Morcha in those days when Modi was the soldier of the organization, not the CM of Gujarat
 un dinon kaa bharosa ab nattejey de rahaa he
 Mittal got the entry from Rajnath quota, Enthisudhanshu Mittal, the person in whose name Rajnath Singh had raised Arun Jaitley in the last term
 kabhi jetali ke khaas rahe mittal phir unke aankh kii kirakiri ban gaye
 But Rajnath did not mind it
 rashtriya team main entry ke saath unhen north east ke rajyon kaa prabharee bhi banaaya gaya
 Then Gadkari came and Mittal had to go behind the curtain
 magar rajnath ke lautate hi unhone ek baar phir se vaapasi kii he
 In Team Modi, Mittal is being told from Rajnath quota
 sangh se nahin liye gaye vivaadit nammuralidhar raav or ram laal sangh cote se aate hai
 Rao has been the convenor of the Swadeshi Jagran Manch and he is counted among those interested in more strategic partnerships than in political politics
 vahiin ram laal barason se bijepi kaa kaam dekh rahe hai, magar suresh soni ke mukaable kam vivaadit rahe hai
 a woman of Indian origin was shot and killed in South Carolina, USA
 mahila kaa naam mridula patel he jo south kerolina ke ek gas stesan main kaam karti thi

 bataaya ja rahaa he ki mridula apane gas stesan par kaam kar rahi thi tabhi lut ke iraade se aae ek agyaat shaks ne mridula ko goli maar di
 Mridula was seriously injured by the bullet
 jiske baad unhen aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 But the doctors' attempt failed and Mridula died

 According to the family members, on January 10, Shravani was doing experiments while lying at her house, when her grandmother scolded her that she was pretending to sleep like a corpse
 is par shrawani ne gusse main kaha ki aapane ye kya kiya meri aatma baahar nikal rahi thi
 i show you and went to the bathroom where i was later found unconscious
 use aspataal le jaaya gaya par doctoron ne use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 Although the police believe that the girl tried to commit suicide in the bathroom, angry with the grandmother's scolding, she later died in the hospital

 Several parties including the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress have joined hands to defeat the BJP-JDU alliance in Bihar for the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 mahagathbandhan main shaamil dalon ke bich seat bantwaare par lagbhag sahmati ban gai he, lekin do-teen siton par pench fansaa hua he
 It is believed that seat sharing will be announced soon after the matter is resolved on these seats
 argedy ke ek netaa kaa daawa he ki argedy or congress ke sheersh netaaon ke bich kam se kam do daur kii baatcheet ho chuki he or donon dal sammanjanak seat bantwaare ke kareeb hai
 Recently, there was a conversation between Congress President Rahul Gandhi and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav
 sutron kii maane to seat bantwaare ko antim rup dene main munger, madhepura or darbhanga seat ko lekar pench fansaa hua he
 The Congress is in favor of contesting Mokama MLA Anant Singh from the Munger seat, but the RJD does not agree
 darasal, tejasvi yadav anant singh ko 'bed element' bataa chuke hai or unhone kaha tha ki mahagathbandhan main aise logon kii koi jagah nahin he
 Recently, BJP expelled MP Kirti Azad has joined the Congress
 isi ke chalate darbhanga seat par bhi pench fansaa hua he
 The Congress wants to field Kirti Azad from this seat
 jabaki mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa bane vikasshil insaan party ke adhyaksh pramukh mukesh saahani bhi isi seat se chunaav ladane kaa man bana chuke hai
 RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari says that the last round of talks is going on between the top leaders of all the parties involved in the grand alliance
 tiwari ishaaron hi ishaaron main is baat ke bhi sanket dete hai ki argedy pehle congress se seat tay kar lenaa chaahati he, uske baad anya dalon se baat karne kii icchhuk he
 The interesting thing is that the Congress wants a Munger seat for Anant Singh or his wife
 jabaki argedy vrishin patel ko munger se or mukesh saahani ko darbhanga se chunaav ladaana chaahati he
 Bihar Congress president Madan Mohan Jha has said that it may take some time to announce the candidates, but the seat sharing between the alliance is expected in the first week of March
 unhone kuch siton par fanse pench ke sambandh main kaha ki sabhi siton ko lekar baatcheet chal rahi he
 Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav is also trying to be a part of the grand alliance
 haal hi main pappu yadav congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se mulaakaat kii thi
 However, the Congress has not yet made any decision regarding Pappu Yadav's 'entry'
 jabaki tejasvi yadav , pappu ko mahagathbandhan main shaamil karne ke khilaaf hai
 He has protested against Pappu on several occasions
 yahi vajah he ki congress ke liye faisla lenaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Pappu Yadav defeated Sharad Yadav in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 sharad yadav jad (you) se nikalne ke baad apni alag party loktantric janata dal bana chuke hai or vah phir se madhepura se lard sakate hai
 In such a situation, if Pappu Yadav has an entry in the grand alliance, then he may have to face the Madhepura seat too

 dilli hai court ne ek bemisaal faisla sunaaya he
 The court has said that the house where the elder daughter will be, will be the 'doer dharta' of the house
 court ne kaha- 'mukhiya kii gaiyr maujuudagi main ghar main jo sabase bada hoga vahi us ghar kaa karta hoga
 Then even if she is a daughter
 ' court ne apane faisle main 'karta' yani mukhiya shabd kaa istemaal kiya he
 Justice Nazmi Waziri pronounced the decision for equal social change
 angreji akhbaar da times of india main chhapi khabar ke mutabik court ne kaha, 'yadi pehle paidaa hone par koi purush mukhiya ke kaamkaaj sambhaal saktaa he to thik aisa hi aurat bhi kar sakati he
 There is no law prohibiting a woman from a Hindu joint family from doing so
 'purush satta par chotcourt ne mana ki mukhiya kii bhoomika main rahete hue purushon ke jimme bade-bade kaam aa jate hai
 Not only this, they also start making their decisions on property, customs and beliefs, on complex and important issues of family
 is lihaaj se yah faisla pitrusattatmak samaaj kii us dhara par chot karata he or use todane vaala he
 The eldest daughter had made the case, the court gave this decision on the case filed on behalf of the elder daughter of a business family of Delhi
 usne pita or teen chaachaaon kii maut ke baad cese daayar kar daawa kiya tha ki vah ghar kii badi beti he
 In this sense, the head is the same
 usne yachika main apane bade chachere bhai ke daawey ko chunauti di thi, jisane khud ko karta ghoshit kar diya tha
 Why this decision is important? Section 6 was added in 2005 after amending the Hindu Succession Act
 iske jariye mahilaon ko paitruk sampatti main baraabar kaa haq diya gaya tha
 But now i got the right to decide the house
 faisle ke baad ab badi beti ke haath main na sirf paitruk sampatti or property se jude haq honge, balki vah ghar-parivaar ke tamaam muddon par apni baat kanoonee haq ke saath rakh paaegi
 The verdict is an example of social change
 bataata he ki jo beti pita ko kandhaa de sakati he, vah pita kii bhoomika main bhi ho sakati he aurkisi bete se kamatar nahinhai
 It has been a tradition since ancient times that the doer of the household, the head man, has lived
 phir chaahe vah ghar main sabase chota hi kyon na ho
 This decision is going to break this tradition
 'aatmanirbharta kii misaal he aurat'faisla sunaate vakt justise wajiri ne kaha ki kanoon ke mutabik sabhi ko samaan adhikaar praapt hai
 Then don't know why women are not considered worthy to be 'karta' till now? While the women of today are walking step by step in every field and are an example of self-reliance
 aisi koi vajah nahin he ki mahilaon ko ghar kii mukhiya banane se roka jaae
 The old law of 1956 has changed in 2005 itself
 ab jab kanoon barabari kaa haq detaa he to adaalaton ko bhi aise maamalon main satarkta baratate hue faisla karnaa chahie
