 Not only does the abuser cause mental anguish, hence the abusive and derogatory remarks made by the expelled BJP leader Dayashankar Singh towards Mayawati is as condemnable, indecisive and undemocratic
 utana hi basapa kaaryakartaaon dwaara singh ke parijanon ke prati kii gayi narebaaji or apshabd nindaneey tathaa amaryadit hai
 He said that Mayawati does not fight for Dalits but only for herself
 unke prati kahe gayi apshabd unka vyaktigat masalaa he, iskaa daliton se koi lenaa-dena nahin he lekin iske baavjood unhone puri basapa ko iske khilaaf sangharsh main utaar diya he
 Maurya said that Mayawati never took the path of mass movement for the problems related to Dalits
 party netaaon ke kehane par bhi vah iske liye kabhi taiyaar nahin hui
 The comments unhone kaha ki janata kii samasyaon ke prati udasin rahane vaali basapa or bhaajapa ne aaj keval gaali kaa jawaab gaali kaa mudda banaakar janandolan kaa rasta pakad liya he

 narendra modi sarkaar ne apana antim purna bajet pesh kar diya or is bajet main sabase zyada charchaa batori mahatvakankshi 'ayushmaan bharat' yojana ne, lekin isamen ek or khaas baat rahi jisko apekshaakrit kaaphi kam charchaa mili
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, while announcing the world's largest health plan 'ayushman Bharat' in his budget speech, said that under this, around 10 crore families will be given medical cover of Rs 5 lakh annually
 saath hi is yojana kaa laabh desh kii 40 fisadi aabaadi yani 50 karod logon ko milegaa
 Private sector companies will also participate in it
 kharchila modicare!modi sarkaar kii is swasthya yojana ko 2010 main america main shuru kii gai charchit 'obamakare' kii tarah mana ja rahaa he
 Like 'obamacare', 'modicare' will also cost huge money
 sutara bataate hai ki centre sarkaar ke anumaan ke mutabik desh main ek vyakti ko yah beemaa dene kii laagat lagbhag 1100 rupee aegi
 In this way, 'modicare' will cost 11 thousand crores every year
 lekin ab baat karte hai us khaas cheez kii jisko kam tarjeeh mili
 Jaitley had said during the budget speech that India will be made a healthy India, for this 1 all over the country
 5 lakh swasthya centre khole jaaenge
 The benefit of opening these health centers will be immediate to the common people, as they will not have to go far for treatment of common diseases and will be able to get treatment from these centers nearby
 saath hi aarogy se judi suvidhaayen bhi muhaiyaa karai jaaengi
 Far from insurance, the initial treatment will be beneficial; On the other hand, the common people will get the benefit of insurance of Rs 5 lakh when they get admitted to the hospital in case of a major or serious illness, but the benefit of health centers, small and big, Sick people will get it immediately
 ab tak desh main ek swasthya centre se duusare swasthya centre ke bich kaaphi duuri hoti thi, lekin dedh lakh nae swasthya kendron ke aa jane kii surat main biimaar logon ke liye ghar ke kareeb hi ilaaj karana sulabh ho jayega
 Especially for people living in remote and rural areas
 unki mahange nijee hospital par nirbharta kam hogi
 If new doctors and new health centers come from new colleges, then doctors will also be needed
 aise main sarkaar ne desh main doctoron kii kami ko dur karne kii badi yojana banaai he or iske liye puure desh main 24 jila hospitalon ko apgrade karte hue medical college main tabdeel kar diya jayega
 Along with treatment in these medical colleges, new doctors will also be prepared
 aaj kii taarikh main bharat main doctor or marij ke bich baari antar dikhataa he or yah anupaat he 1: 1700 kaa
 Whereas according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 400 patients should have a doctor
 nai yojana ke tahat har 3 sansadeey kshetra yaa phir ek rajya main kam se kam ek medical college khole jaaenge
 At present, 67 thousand MBBS and 31 thousand post graduate doctors pass out from both private and government medical colleges in the country
 aise main kai nae medical college khulne se doctoron kii kami dur hogi or logon ke ilaaj ke liye paryaapt doctor sulabh ho sakenge
 Employment will also increase, 24 district hospitals will be upgraded, medical colleges will be opened and one and a half lakh new health centers will be opened
 aasapaas ke kshetron se marijon ke aane se kai tarah kii suvidhaayen viksit hongi or aam logon ko isse phayda hoga
 But will it be so easy, what will be the success of Modi government's ambitious and 'ayushman Bharat' scheme announced a year before the election
 modi sarkaar kaa yah antim purna bajet he or bhaashan ke dauraan vitt mantri ne is par kharch kii jane vaali dhanrashi ko lekar koi charchaa nahin kii
 Only the announcement has been made and it may take time to prepare its outline
 sarkaar agar agle kuch maheenon main isaki vistrut ghoshnaa karti he to kuch baat ban sakati he, lekin agar isamen 6 maah se zyada kii bhi deree hui to us samay tak desh main chunavi maahaul banataa jayega or centre main bijepi apni satta bachaae rakhane kii jugat main biji ho jaaegi
 Then its future will depend on the new government
 iskaa doosraa paksh yah bhi he ki ise lagu kis tarah kiya jaataa he
 Earlier too many big and ambitious plans were launched in the country and everyone saw its fate
 2005 main manmohan singh sarkaar dwaara ghoshit rashtriya swasthya mishan (NHM) kaa haal sabhi ko maaloom he
 The National Rural Health Scheme (NHRM) under NHM has been the much talked about scam
 rashtriya beemaa yojanaon kaa pradarshan bahut kharaab rahaa he
 The health insurance scheme also looks populist like every announcement, but its success depends on how and how it is implemented as well as how seriously
 maa brahmacharini kaa mandir kaashi ke saptasagar (karnghanta) kshetra main sthit he
 The worship of Brahmacharini Devi is considered very important in the order of worship of Durga
 subah se hi lag jaati he bheedakashi ke ganga kinare balaji ghat par sthitmaa brahmacharini ke mandirmen subah se hi shraddhaluon kii bheed lag jaati he
 The devotees take the line and get the darshan of the mother
 shraddhalu maa ke is rup kaa darshan karne ke liye nariyal, chunari, maala-phool aadi lekar shraddha-bhakthi ke saath apni baari aane kaa intjaar karte hai
 Seeing the mother, you get the attainment of the divine; the form of Goddess Brahmacharini is fully lit and very magnificent
 inke daahine haath main jap kii maala evam baayen haath main kamandal rahata he
 One who worships this form of the Goddess, he gets Sakshat Parabrahma
 maa ke darshan maatr se shraddhalu ko yash or kirti praapt hoti he
 Every wish is fulfilled, here people come not only from Kashi but also from other districts for philosophy and worship
 navaratri par to is mandir main lakhon bhaktama ke darshan karne ke liye aate hai
 It is believed that those who see this form of mother get child happiness
 saath hi wo bhakton kii har manokamana puri karti hai

 It is believed that Amar Singh's former assistant Saxena has told the Delhi Police that he was just a courier and had no information about the source of money

 jaish-e-mohammad sargana masood ajahar ne pulavama hamale se sirf 9 din pehle peshawar main aatankiyon ke bade jamaavade ke khilaaf bharat ke khilaaf jehad chhedane kii baat kahi thi
 This has been revealed in the India Today investigation
 masood ajahar ne khaybar pakhtukhwa soobe kii rajdhani main haive ke paas khule aam hui aatankiyon kii raily main bharat ke khilaaf jehar ugala
 Let us know that PTI (pakistan tehreek-e-insaf) of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has been ruling in Khyber Pakhtunwa province since 2013
 india today ke paas maujuud sabooton se saaf pataa chalata he ki pakistan ke uttar purvi hisse main hui aatankiyon kii raily ko police kii puri suraksha muhaiyaa karai gai
 Imran on one side is clearly denying his country's support for terrorism
 vahiin 5 farvari ko peshawar main hui raily main masood ajahar kii ore se bharat ke khilaaf jehar ugalane kii recording ne imran ke daawey kii pole khol kar rakh di he
 Imran said in his address on Pakistan television on Tuesday that i am replying to the Indian government which had blamed Pakistan (for the Pulwama attack)
 aisa koi saboot nahin tha
 Imran had said that if India has intelligence about the involvement of Pakistani terrorists in the Pulwama attack, then make it available to Pakistan
 imran ne ye bhi kaha tha ki wo yakeen dilaate hai ki us par karrwai kii jaaegi
 Masood Azhar had openly threatened to carry out terrorist attacks against India on the occasion of the so-called 'kashmir Solidarity Day' in Peshawar
 bataa den ki is kathith kashmir ekajutata diwas ko pakistan sarkaar kii ore se puure pakistan main manaaya jaataa he
 anti-india slogans and 'nara-e-takbir' can be heard when Azhar speaks of jihad in India Today audio from a messaging channel associated with Jaish
 jaish sargana aatankiyon kii raily main jo kuch bhi bolta he usase sanket miltaa he ki pakistan kii maujuuda hukumat ne aatanki gatividhiyaan badhaane ke liye aatanki sanghathanon ko puraa maahaul dene kii peshkash kii he
 In the audio, Masood Azhar can be heard shouting that the time has come to wave the Jaish flag at every house in Pakistan
 masood ajahar aatankiyon kii raily ko sangrakshan dene ke liye surakshakarmiyon kii maujuudagi kaa hawala bhi detaa he
 In the audio, Azhar says, "we have also seen the time in Pakistan when our brothers in uniform were asked to remove our flags
 jaish kaa jhanda thaamne waalon ko pakadaney ke liye kaha jaataa tha
 "azhar says," Today my eyes are moist when i see these uniformed brothers walking under the same flags in our rally here
 ” audio main police ke syran thodi thodi der baad sunai dete rahete hai
 Azhar can also be heard quoting Pulwama in this audio of 5 February where a suicide attack occurred on 14 February
 ajahar kii ore se jammu or kashmir ke sirf pulavama jile kaa naam liye janaa apane aap main bahut kuch kahata he
 Azhar said on 5 February, "if you google 'a girl from Pulwama', you will see that the roofs of the houses of Kashmir villages will see the flag of Jaish and pictures of the Jaish chief (mine)
 ” pehle kuch news reports main jaish sargana ke gambhir rup se biimaar hone kii baat kahi gai thi
 Two days after the Pulwama attack, Pakistan's Information Minister Fawad Chaudhary had claimed that the government would take tough measures against jaish-e-mohammed
 lekin masood ajahar kii peshawar raily ne dikhaaya ki wo pakistan kii zamin se aatanki gatividhiyaan chalaa rahaa he or use aisa karne kii puri chhot hasil he
 Masood Azhar has a stronghold in the Cantt area in Bahawalpur in Punjab province of Pakistan
 wo 800 kilometre kaa safar tay karne ke baad 5 farvari ko peshawar main aatankiyon kii raily main bolne ke liye aayaa
 Jaish kingpin reiterated that he will continue his jihad under the supervision of Imran Khan government
 masood ajahar ne dhamkee di ki pakistan ke vibhinn hisson se aatankiyon ko bhej kar bharat main hamale karaae jaaenge
 Azhar said in Peshawar on 5 February, "youths from different parts of Pakistan including Karachi, Peshawar, Bahawalpur and Gujranwala are going to Kashmir for jihad and the process will continue
" ’ajahar ne beete saal oktober main apane bhattije osman haidar ke bhartiya suraksha balon ke haathon khatme kaa bhi hawala diya
 Masood Azhar vowed to avenge the killing of Hyder, saying, "we had the tomb of Afzal Guru earlier, now we sacrificed Talha and Usman as well
 jaish e mohammad puure desh (pakistan) se log bhejtaa rahegaa
 " BJP ke dalit saansad kaa ek or aarope: daliton ke 'bharat band' ke baad unhen pratadit kiya ja rahaa he After Shikhar Dhawan's century, on the basis of Jaydev Unadkat's sharp bowling, Team India defeated hosts Zimbabwe for the second consecutive ODI to take a 2-0 lead in the five-match series

 jaipur main ek naukar par hue jaanaleva hamale ne sansani machaa di he
 The special thing is that this servant belongs to VHP leader Damodar Modi
 vahi damodar modi jinke ghar se 22 karod kii najayas sampatti, inakam tex ke chaape main pai gai thi
 Some of the most loyal servants of Modi tried to kill him, not even recorded firs
 isse bhi zyaada hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki modi ne apane vafaadaar naukar par hue hamale kaa exiaar tak nahin karavaaya
 This servant named Susheel Paswan used to work for Damodar Modi for the last 15 years
 vaardaat shanivaar ko hui
 According to the police, the servant was sleeping at that time
 paas main driver or ek doosraa naukar bhi so rahaa tha
 Around 4 am, some armed men entered the house
 ek ne susheel paswan kaa munh dabaaya or duusare ne galaa katkar use maarane kii koshish kii
 It is also a matter of doubtful that it is so easy to enter Modi's Kilanuma bungalow, even then there are four armed guards outside the bungalow
 ek or baat saamne aa rahi he jisase ye maamla kaaphi sandigdh lag rahaa he
 It is being said that Sushil was also strongly questioned by the Income Tax officials because some of Modi's assets are also in Sushil's name
 jaankaree police ko kyon nahi dihairani is baat se bhi ho rahi he ki paas main soe driver or duusare naukar kii neend kyon nahin khuli
 And the biggest question is why the family members of Modi did not inform the police about this incident with their oldest servant
 duusare naukar ramesh ne ambulance bulaai or aspataal le gaya

 China has once again hit back at India's attempt to include Maulana Masood Azhar, the leader of the Pakistani terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed, in the UN Global List of Terrorists
 china ne takneekee aadhaar par vishay kii jaanch ke liye or samay maanga he
 In the past also China has used veto on Masood Azhar 3 times
 lekin jaankaron kaa kahana he ki is baar kaa mouhaal alag tha, kyonki bharat ko 14 deshon ke saath suraksha parishad ke 4 sthaayee sadasyon kaa samarthan hasil tha, duusari ore aatankwaad ke maamle par china akelaa pakistan kaa samarthan karata dikh rahaa tha
 China's argument - and need time - China Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in his statement that more time for China to conduct an in-depth investigation on the case of listing jaish-e-mohammed chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist
 needed
 china kaa rukh sanyukt raashtra pratibandh samiti ke niyamon, prakriyaaon ke anuroop he
 The 'technical moratorium' is to ensure that China has sufficient time to study the matter

 China says that it needs more time to study the subject
 yah sirf bahaanaa he kyonki isse pehle bhi china teen baar is mudde par vito kaa istemaal kar chukaa he
 How much time does he need now? This time was different Atmosphere Parthasarathy believes that this time the atmosphere is different globally
 sanyukt raashtra main is prastaav kaa 14 deshon ne samarthan kiya he or suraksha parishad ke 4 sthaayee sadsy bharat ke saath khadey hai
 This is the first time India has received such support on the issue of Pakistan
 jaahir he aatankwaad jaise samvedansheel mudde par jiskaa khud china bhi shikaar rahaa he, wo akelaa khadaa he
 So in a way, China seems to be isolated on the global scene in this matter

 unhone na sirf videshi mahila kaa balaatkaar kiya, balki puure desh kaa sir bhi shame se jhukaa diya
 Their offense does not deserve to be pardoned or punished, so the court dismisses their appeal while retaining the life sentence of all

 Many films have also been made on the bar concept, including 'bar Girl' and Madhur Bhandarkarki's 'chandni Bar' and now another film on Dance Bar is ready to be part of this category, named 'barkha'
 aaie sabase pehle isaki kahani jaan lete hai

 According to the information, Asma Khan is also a member of the student organization Bhagat Kranti Dal (BKD)
 bikedi bhagat singh kii punyatithi par college auditorium main ek kaarykram yojit karnaa chahta tha, lekin college prashasan ne isaki ijaajat nahin di
 College Principal Neeraj Agnihotri said, 'on March 23, Bhagat Singh's death anniversary, two student organizations - BKD and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) wanted to organize the program in the college auditorium
 lekin donon hi chaatr sanghathanon ko isaki ijaajat nahin di gai
 Asma Khan has called college teachers as 'traitors' on Facebook for not being allowed
 'unhone bataaya ki asamaa khan ko expel karnaa kaa faisla college kii staff council ne liya he
 He also said that Asma Khan should have either deleted her Facebook post or submitted an apology

 On not giving permission for the program, the principal said that the college is not against such programs, but the auditorium was booked till March 20 due to a training program being run by the government

 bujurgon yaa umr badhane ke saath hi haddiyon kaa kamjor hona yani osteoporosis ek aam samasya he, jisase unke tuutane / fracture kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Fractures are particularly likely in the hip, spinal cord and wrist bone

 osteoposis ke kaaran haddi tootna ek badi samasya he, jo aksar umr badhane ke saath gambhir hoti jaati he
 Explaining the causes of osteoporosis, the health expert said, 'there are many medications that can cause osteoporosis
 jaise corticosteroid, anti-depressent, anti-hisertensive, anti-konvalasent aadi
 Therefore, these medicines should be consumed only under doctor's supervision
 iske alaava stroke, hyperthyridism adirogke liye lee jane vaali dawaaon se bhi osteoporosis kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 According to 'health Expert,' a person who has had a broken bone before, is more likely to fracture due to osteoporosis in the future
 depressant bhi kabhi-kabhi osteoporosis kaa kaaran ban saktaa he, kyonki depressant se ek hormone cortisol banataa he, jo haddiyon se minerals ko sokh kar unhen kamjor banaata he

 The results of the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections in Uttar Pradesh have shocked
 tripura vijay ke kuch din ke bheetar hi hue in donon siton par upachunaav ke nateezon ne bijepi ko hakkaa-bakka kar diya
 Of these, 1 seat was dominated by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and the other gave Deputy Chief Minister to the state
 upi main modi lahar ne vidhansabha chunaav main apana paracham fahraaya, lekin mahaj ek saal main aisa kya ho gaya ki 2 sabase pramukh siton par bijepi ne apni saakh kho di
 In Gorakhpur, we tried to understand the reasons behind the bjp's defeat, which contributed to Yogi's credibility in his own house

 The city's voter did not come out of the house, there can be no place to do politics and understand better than the chaupal of tea in the middle of the city
 gorakhpur main paraag jaise chaay vaale raajnneeti ke har pahalu ko har din hone vaali chaoupal kii charchaa se bhaap lete hai
 Parag says that the taste of tea in Gorakhpur has deteriorated because no one has gone to vote
 gorakhpur ke baniyaa, brahman or thakur kuch zyada hi sukh-suvidha paa gaye or isliye vah yogi ko bhul gaye
 There are many people from Gorakhpur city like Parag who express their opinion on these results
 vinay kumaar kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke ummidavaar ummid se zyada aashwast the ki gorakhpur main BJP kaa raaj he or har haal main vahi jeetegi
 Many corporators and wards of the BJP won the elections in the civic elections, but during the bye-elections no one put a chaupal or appeared in the campaign
 bijepi ke netaa or kaaryakarta vot dalwane bhi nahin aae

 rojgaar muhaiyaa karaane main vifalgorakhpur ke gaanvon main bijepi kii haar kii vajah jaanane par ek alag tasviir najar ai
 Rural youth say that people could not get employment
 isliye unamem naaraazgi thi
 Due to the decisions of the Yogi government related to the sand sand and soil business, it was very difficult for the poor at the local level due to which there was resentment in the public in rural areas
 isse garib janata ko kai mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padaa

 mayawati kaa jaadu kaayambasapa ke samarthak ramesh kumaar kaa kahana tha ki basapa kaa 100 pratishat vot gorakhpur ke up chunaav main samaajawaadee party ke ummidavaar ko gaya
 We also asked whether he did not feel uncomfortable in voting his anti-party candidate, in response to which Ramesh said that he only and only following the order of sister ji, the BSP voters voted SP 
 unka yah bhi aarope he ki bijepi kii jumalebaji se bhi log pareshaan ho gaye hai
 The problem of unemployment has become the biggest issue

 The caste equation also shows the Nishad community of Bheda Yogi living in Pipraich village of Kilagorakhpur and alleges that the Yogi government did nothing for him
 yogi sarkaar ne nishad samaaj ke liye or unki jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 Apart from the grievances, the right equation was created by the caste equation that emerged after the alliance of SP and BSP, due to which the BJP suffered such a huge loss in Gorakhpur and the Samajwadi Party for which there was not much scope in Gorakhpur, also to penetrate the Yogi Fort

 Farmers upset with bjp's cow love, but has the rural population of Gorakhpur moved away from BJP just because of resentment or is there another reason? When we moved forward in rural areas, a new reason was also seen
 gramin ilaakon ke log aawaara jaanwaron ke prakope se pareshaan hai

 rajya ke mukhyamantri raghuvar das ke netritv main bijepi lagaataar duusari baar purna bahumat ke saath satta main vaapasi ko betaab he
 In view of the result of the Lok Sabha elections, BJP has set a mission-65 plus target in the assembly elections
 bijepi-ageesu ne milakar chunavi maidan main utarane kaa faisla kiya he, lekin bijepi ke liye jharkhand main raah aasaan hogi yaa nahin, ye suspence nateeja aane tak bana rahegaa
 In the recently concluded Maharashtra and Haryana Assembly elections, the BJP had given a lot of emphasis on national issues (section-370, triple talaq, Ayodhya case etc
), but the results were not very encouraging and BJP remained far away from its target
 aise main kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki bijepi ke liye jharkhand main local mudde kaaphi ahm honge
 The two states did not get a majority
 In Maharashtra and Haryana elections, the BJP had set its target far away from the target it had set
 donon rajyon main use bahumat nahin mila
 The BJP, which won 40 seats in Haryana, needed the support of Jananayak Janata Party (JJP)
 vahiin, maharashtra main abhi tak sthiti saaf nahin ho pai he
 The agreement between Shiv Sena and BJP has not been reached
 yahaan shivasena or bijepi ke bich siem kii kursi ko lekar bavaal machaa hua he
 Both are adamant on their respective demands

 The BJP wants to touch the majority figure this time
 bhaajapa ne rashtriya upaadhyaksh or rajya ke vidhansabha chunaav prabharee om maathur ko is morche par beete agast se hi laga rakhaa he
 Even though the NDA won 12 out of 14 seats in the Lok Sabha elections held in Jharkhand this year, the party is not in any way cheating the assembly elections
 party kaa maananaa he ki haryana kii sabhi 10 loksabhaa siton par sweep karne ke baad bhi jab vidhansabha chunaav main bahumat nahin mil paaya to phir jharkhand ko lekar bhi 'ati aatmavishvaas' kaa shikaar hona thik nahin
 Last time, the BJP got 37 seats in 81, in fact, bjp's concern about Jharkhand is because it got only 37 seats out of 81 last time
 tab bahumat ke liye bhaajapa ko mukhya vipakshi dal jhavimo ke chah vidhayakon ko todna padaa tha
 After this, BJP had 43 mlas as against 41 required for majority
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki agar 2014 kii tarah phir bhaajapa kii gaadi bahumat se dur khadi ho gai to pichhali baar kii tarah jod-tod kii raajnneeti ke liye majaboor hona padegaa, aise main party is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main puri takat jhonkkar bahumat laane kii koshish main he
 RISKBJP will not take ticket distribution, like Haryana, it does not want to take any kind of risk in ticket distribution in Jharkhand
 haryana main tikat katane se naaraaz hue kai netaaon ne jis tarah se baagi ke rup main chunaav ladakar jeet darj kii, usase bhaajapa jharkhand main janaadhar vaale netaaon ko naaraaz karne kaa jokhim bilkul mol lenaa nahin chaahati
 These issues of Jharkhand are important issues of health, education, agriculture and employment
 lau and order kii samasyaain puure pradesh main he
 The matter of teachers will also arise in this election

 In the ball tempering controversy, Steve Smith and David Warner have been banned for a year and now both players have left the South Africa tour and returned to their homeland
 in donon dhurandhar khilaadiyon kii anupasthiti main australian team south africa ke khilaaf khilne bhi utar chuki he, ab is test match kaa nateeja kya hoga yah to kuch din baad hi pataa chal paaegaa
 But with the help of some figures, it can be understood how Steve Smith and David Warner have contributed to the Australian team's victory in the last 5 years
 australian media dwaara die gaye ek aankade ke anusaar pichley paanch saalon main australian team dwaara banaae gaye kul ran kaa 35 fisadi hissaa keval smith or warner ne banaae hai
 The importance of these two in Test matches can be understood from the fact that in the last 5 years (since 2013), Smith is the number one highest scorer in world cricket with 5940 runs, while Warner is third with 5380 runs
 The place is occupied
 ball tempring maamle main smith ko rota dekh bhavuk hua ye ectorin donon ke bich keval england ke jo root hai, jo 5659 ran banaakar duusare number par hai
 Both these batsmen have no match in terms of making a century, Smith is still at number one with 23 centuries in terms of making the highest century since 2013, while Warner and India's Virat Kohli are second with 18 centuries
 Huh
 in donon khilaadiyon ne saath mila kar australia kii ore se 41 shatak lagaae hai jabaki baaki kii team 35 shatak hi laga saki he
 Smith's record as captain is even better, Smith has scored 3659 runs in 34 Tests as a captain at an average of over 70
 in donon khilaadiyon kaa record hi kaaran he ki australian cricketron ko milane vaale sabase bade sammaan alan border medal par pichley chaar saalon se inhi donon kaa kabja he
 Although both batsmen have dominated the odis apart from Test cricket, Warner is sixth with 2804 runs while Smith is at 9th position with 2510 runs, the highest run-scorer in ODI cricket since 2015
 in donon khilaadiyon ke aakande yah bataane ke liye kaaphi hai ki kaise yah donon pichley chaar paanch saalon main australian team kii ridh kii haddi ban gaye the
 In such a situation, how will the Australian team be able to compensate these two players, it will only tell the time to come

 As soon as the talk of Delhi's Sankat Mochan Hanuman statue was airlifted, the priests and devotees of the temple have strongly opposed it
 sawaal yah he ki kya 108 feet oonchi vishaal hanuman murti ko hawaii saadhan se duusari jagah le janaa sambhav he? puure maamle main 'ajtak' kii team ne mandir kaa jayja liya he or export se baatcheet kar janaa ki sainkadon ton vajan vaali murti ko airlift karnaa kitna mumkin he
 The main reason for removing the idol idol being removed due to traffic jam is the problem of encroachment and traffic jam at Karol Bagh intersection
 haalanki pichley 2 dashakon se har mangalvaar ko mandir darshan karne waalon kaa maananaa he ki atikaraman or trephic kii samasya dilli ke kai ilaakon main he, aise main sirf hanuman murti ko hataanaa sahi nahin he
 Representative of Obam has also visited the temple for the last 15 years, the priest Ganesh Dutt Pandey said - As much as the height of the Hanuman statue is, the deeper the part of the statue is inside the ground
 murti ke neeche kai gufaaen bhi hai
 There are idols of Goddess Kali, Mother Vaishno Devi as well as many deities
 pujari kaa daawa he ki obama ke pratinidhi unke raashtrapati banane se pehle is mandir main aashirwad lene aaye the, jiske baad wo raashtrapati bane
 The Mahant Kanhaiya of the 13-year-old temple was engaged in preparing the idol, said that it took 13 years to prepare the Hanuman idol
 mahant ke mutabik 1994 se 2007 ke bich jab murti ko banaaya gaya, tab aasapaas jangal tha
 At that time there was no project to build the road
 mahant kaa kahana he ki court or sarkaar ko apane faisle par dobaaraa vichaar karnaa chahie
 Because the idol of Hanuman is not just a temple but the identity of Delhi and the country
 faisle se log bhi naakhushkarol baag main rahane vaali pallavi aksar mandir ke baahar saji dukaanon se locket yaa dhaage kharidne aati hai
 Pallavi told that whenever Delhi is mentioned in a TV serial or film, it starts with the Hanuman idol
 pallavi bataati hai ki hanuman murti unke liye bahut garv kii baat he
 Pallavi, who is studying in college, believes that the decision to remove the statue is wrong due to mere encroachment
 vayusena ke export ne kaha- airlift se pehle aankalan jaruri108 fit oonchi hanuman murti ko airlift karnaa kya mumkin he
 Aaj Tak has a conversation with Captain Sandeep Mehta on this
 sandip mehta kaa kahana he ki air lift ke liye vajan sabase zyada ahm he
 Because the matter is a matter, it cannot be taken in separate parts
 murti ko ek saath airlift karnaa mumkin nahin he
 If the distance is not much and the weight is less, then with less fuel, you can lift 20 to 25 tons of air
 bhartiya sena main kshamta he, lekin vajan or duuri kaa aankalan karnaa behad zaruri hoga
 This area is very congested, so it is also important to assess it
 dilli se mumbai yaa kolkata tak safar karne waalon ke liesuresh prabhukarel bajtek bahut badi raahat lekar aayaa he kyonki ab in mahanagaron ke bich unka travel time kam hone vaala he
 Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu announced the High Speed corridor while presenting the Railway Budget to reduce travel time
 apane bajet bhaashan ke dauraan prabhu ne kaha, ‘ham 9 coridor main train kii speed badha rahe hai
 The speed of the current 110 and 130 kilometers will now increase to 160 and 200 kilometers respectively
 isse mahanagaron ke bich train yatra ek raat ke dauraan hi puri ho jaaegi
 Regarding the high speed train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad, he said that the study on this is in its advanced phase which is likely to be completed by the middle of this year
 apane bajet bhaashan ke dauraan bahucharchit mumbai-ahmedabad bullate train pariyojna par unhone kaha ki mumbai main jameen nahin mil paane kii vajah se is pariyojna main deree ho rahi he
 Significantly, during his first budget speech, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu neither increased the passenger fare nor announced any new trains

 Less than two weeks after his return on 16 April, this half-hearted politician has turned into a hazy-sounding MP and the fiercest leader of the opposition
 ve is dauraan chaar baar loksabhaa or kai baar usase baahar bol chuke hai
 He has met farmers outside his home, addressed them at a rally held in Delhi, gone to Punjab to meet farmers and the country from Vidarbha in Maharashtra against the Modi government's policies on farm, land and labor reforms Have started the trek across India
 is bich unhone kedarnath mandir kii yatra karne kaa bhi samay nikaal liya

 rahul agar lambii duuri kii rajnatik res daud rahe hai to achaanak hi ve teji ke saath peeche se bhaagate hue tej daudaahe vaale duusare dhavakon ke bich pahunch gaye hai
 In this process, they have gone the way from farmers' rights to net neutrality and by visiting Kedarnath, they have given a subtle political message to win back the hearts of the party's Hindu voters who were traditionally Congress supporters
 Used to do unhone sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhane ke nae tareeke bhi khoj liye hai
 Now he has also become adept at the art of giving tactful answers to political opponents

 yah yojana pichley saal ke ant main do maheene tak congress ke 400 se zyada netaaon se kii gai charchaa kaa nateeja he
 a four-pronged strategy has been made in this plan — strengthen the party at the grassroots level, raise the issues that more and more people are connected so that the hearts of the traditional supporters of the Congress can be won again, in the states where the Congress is in opposition So, raise the issue against the government there and continuously protest on the streets, and correct those mistakes like appeasement of Muslims, due to which in the 2014 elections Party was the situation
 haalanki rahul farvari main hi apni yojana bana chuke the, lekin use kab shuru kiya jaae, is baat ko lekar nishchit nahin the
 Due to strong opposition from the old leaders over some of their reforms and the initial fear of rebellion within the party in the mind of Sonia Gandhi, Rahul's plan got delayed in implementation
 congress ke ek mahasachiv kehete hai, "rahul kii lambii chuttee ne unki maa ko party ke bheetar sab kuch thik karne or rahul ko kaman saunpane ke liye anukool maahaul banane kaa mauka diya
 "when Sonia suddenly came up and raised the issue of farmers and opposed the Land Acquisition Act, there was a wave of hope and renewed enthusiasm among the Congress workers who were going through despair
 unhone apane bete ko bhi sanghathanaatmak badlaav karne kii unki yojana taalane ke liye raji kar liya or unhen bharosa dilaayaa ki party ke bade netaa unke raste main roda nahin khadaa karenge
 The result of these steps: Rahul will not make any major changes in the All India Congress Committee except to include some young leaders
 sirf ek hi bada badlaav hone kii ummid yah he ki sonia ke rajnatik sachiv ahamed patel ko 86 varshiya motilal vora kii jagah party kaa koshadhyaksh banaaya ja saktaa he
 Sonia has made her message clear: Let Rahul do his work and she will take care of the old big leaders herself
 pichley saal rahul se milane vaale congress ke kuch netaaon ne unhen salaah di thi ki ve puure desh main yatra karen or ek rajya main kam se kam do din guzaaren
 As Prime Minister Narendra Modi's main opposition leader was about to be re-launched, the land acquisition law and the unseasonal rains in some states led to the issue of crop destruction itself
 kisaanon kaa badhibia mudda30 april ko unhone kisaanon, jameen or shram sudhaaron par modi sarkaar kii nitiyon ke khilaaf maharashtra ke vidarbha se padayatra shuru kar di
 His decision is inspired by the strategy of former Prime Ministers — Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, under whose leadership the party suffered defeat in 1977 and 1989 respectively
 un donon hi netaaon ne tab janata or party kaaryakartaaon se dobaaraa judye ke liye desh kii yatra kii thi
 Congress leaders close to Rahul say that this new incarnation of him was inevitable because for the first time since joining politics, he is in opposition
 party ke mumbai ikai ke adhyaksh sanjay nirupam kehete hai, "2004 main jab ve party main aae, tab se congress satta main rahi he
 Despite this, he criticized the government whenever he saw any deficiency and raised his voice for the rights of farmers in bhatta-parsaul and the tribals in Niyamgiri
 ab ve vipaksh main hai or ve apni is nai bhoomika main jamkar ladaai karenge
 "rahul is not dependent on a few numbered advisors in his new form
 uttar pradesh main congress ke ek netaa kehete hai, "ab ve sabaki baat sunate hai, lekin faisla unka apana hota he
 They take note of people coming from every field, whether it is anyone related to education, NGO, politics
 " isliye kedarnath kii yatra karne kaa suzav pichley saal navaniyukt pradesh congress adhyaksh kii ore se diya gaya tha to net nirpekshata kaa mudda purv saansad milind devda ke likhe akhbaar ke ek lekh se prerit tha
 Unlike the old days, they are now ahead in decision making
 22 april ko jab dilli main aam aadmi party (aap) kii jansabha main ek kisaan ne kathith rup se aatmahatya kar lee to unhone ram manohar lohia aspataal, jahaan kisaan kaa shav rakhaa tha, jane se pehle rajasthan congress adhyaksh sachin payalat ko turant phone lagaaya or unhen us kisaan ke parivaar se milane kaa nirdesh diya
 It is clear that they are fully committed to prevent any other party from taking the place of opposition
 soshal media kaa daanvcongressi netaa maanate hai ki rahul ko apni kuch nijee ranneetiyaan badalane kii jarurat he
 For example, their way of communicating
 digvijay singh jaise netaaon ne unase khulkar apil kii he ki ve soshal media se juden, lekin gandhi parivaar kaa yah vaaris abhi tak isaki andekhi karata aayaa he
 In November, when a Congress leader told him how he could connect with millions of people through Twitter, Rahul told him that he found it all too complicated and he did not have enough time for it
 lekin rahul kii yah baat pachne vaali nahin he, kyonki unhen aksar hi apane smart phone main uljhe hue dekha gaya he
 But the way attention is being paid to Uttar Pradesh, it shows that Rahul has now realized very well that the party has to be strengthened in the states and that is why he is electing the presidents of the state units
 Are and making their appointments
 jin logon kii niyukti kii ja chuki he, unke liye nirdesh saaf hai—booth str se hi sachche kaaryakartaaon ko party main shaamil karen, hataash kaaryakartaaon ke man main ummid kaa sanchaar karen or anushaasan sthapit karen
 Now the big question is whether Rahul will be able to keep this spirit and passion, especially given that there is still four years left for the next Lok Sabha election
 yaa unka yah jajba kadaahi main tadake kii tarah he, jaisaa unke maamle main pehle bhi dekha ja chukaa he, jab unhone bhatta-parsul or niamgiri main adivaasiyon kaa mudda bad-chadh kar uthaaya tha
 Showing similar zeal, he had torn the ordinance protecting the convicted leaders and then suddenly disappeared
 har koi is baat par yakeen karne ko taiyaar nahin he ki is baar aisa nahin hoga
 Even some people in his party believe this
 maharashtra ke ek diggaj netaa kehete hai, "ve is samay jo kar rahe hai, vah bahut acha he
 But they do not have the ability to take the leadership of the party
 ve party kii kaman thaamne ke liye sahi nahin hai
 "rahul's biggest challenge will be to prove this notion wrong

 is satr ke ant main sawaal-jawaab ke dauraan in netaaon se vahaan maujuud hastiyon ne kai ahm sawaal puche
 Vinod Bansal, leader of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, asked if the issue of Ram temple in Parliament came up, would the Congress support it? Even before Singhvi gave any answer on this issue, Owaisi said that no such proposal can come in the Parliament because this issue is a matter of ownership which is already going on in the court
 vahiin singhvi ne kaha ki agar-magar vaale sawaal ke jawaab nahin die ja sakate
 If any such issue comes up in the Parliament, first it will have to be agreed between all the parties
 agar sabhi dalon kii sahmati banati he or prastaav sansad main aata he to uskaa sabhi dal samarthan karenge
 In the same question and answer session, Singhvi was asked when the victims of the Sikh riot would get justice

 He said that we will never get justice but we have to remember this event and keep reminding it for the coming generations so that they can continue to fight for it

 They can understand the anguish hidden behind this question, but the justice process is continuously going on the accused

 On this session, Owaisi was asked the question whether he agreed to the triple talaq
 isapar unka jawaab tha ki ye paap he lekin ye hota he isliye muslim personal lau board muslim yuvaaon se kah rahaa he ki agar unki shaadi vifal hoti he to kripaya ise na apanaaen or talaak kii jo sahi prakriya he uskaa paalan karen

 com / 5obr6h4fx9— ANI (@ani_news)june 13, 2015 Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana, which is said to be the political opponent of Rahul Gandhi, has praised him before the result of Gujarat elections and also has high expectations from him in future
 gujarat chunaav ke parinaam aane se pehle rahul gandhi ne congress ke adhyaksh pad kaa kaman sambhaal liya he, is tarah se unke kaarykaal main gujarat kaa parinaam sabase pehla ahm rigelt hoga
 After the departure of Sonia Gandhi, now the 'rahul era' has started in the Congress
 saamana rahul kii tarif karte hue likhata he ki vah aise samay main party kii kaman sambhaal rahe hai jab vah apane astitv ke liye sangharsh kar rahi he
 There has been considerable decline in the party at all levels
 yahaan tak ki 2014 main centre main satta se bedakhal hone ke baad vah mukhya vipakshi dal hone laayak jeet bhi hasil nahin kar saki thi
 Now the future of the country's oldest party Congress is dependent on this young shoulder
 saamana aage likhata he, aakhri saans le rahi congress ko is bure din se nikaalane kii jimmedaari un par he or iske liye unako thodaa vakt dena hoga
 Especially those who make a lot of noise on their leadership ability
 saamana likhata he ki rahul gandhi or unki party congress se hamaara kaaphi matbhed he
 But this differs from its ostentatious ideology
 desh ke saamne aane vaali chunautiyon par unhen khulkar bolnaa hoga
 He writes, the way he took command of the party in the Gujarat elections has given a new hope
 vah chunaav parinaam ke bare main soche bagaiyr lagaataar maidan main date rahe or sattadhari dal ko tagdi chunauti di
 Supporting Rahul, Saamana further says that he will have to work with restraint
 jo kehete hai ki rahul kuch nahin kar sakate wo andhvishwasi hai
 Who says about Pandit Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi that they have no contribution in the development of the country, they are wrong and living in ignorance

 He later came to power by toppling the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif

 Recently, Aam Aadmi Party leaders did the same
 tab congressi naaraaz ho gaye
 He told AAP leaders about decency
 unhone kaha ki bhashaa kii shaleenta jaruri he
 But now the Congressmen themselves are seen using similar language
 unhen lagata he ki aisi bhashaa kaa istemaal karke ve maidan maar lenge yaa phir apane samarthakon main utsaah bhar denge
 Elections, leaders think blunt and sometimes many times the thinking of leaders gets blunted during elections

 raajnneetigyon ke sochane kaa tarika badalata ja rahaa he
 Nothing matters more to them than power
 aisa lagata he ki uske liye ve kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai
