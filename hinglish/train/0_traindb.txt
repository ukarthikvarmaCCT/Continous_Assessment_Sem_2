 Former Maharashtra Pwd and Home Minister Chhagan Bhujbal is getting in trouble one after the other
 maharashtra ke purv mantri chagan bhujabal ke khilaaf bhrashtachar nirodhak beuro ke baad ab idi yani pravartan nideshaalay ne isiaiaar (enforcement case iinformation report) darj kar jaanch shuru kar di he
 According to the law, the ED can file an ECIR against someone only if another investigative agency has filed an FIR against him
 chagan bhujabal ke khilaaf asibi abhi tak 2 maamle darj kar chuki he
 Just a day before, the Maharashtra ACB has raided the houses of Chhagan Bhujbal and revealed a total of 31 immovable properties
 pravartan nideshaalay ne bhujabal ke khilaaf mani londering yani kaale paise ko safed karne ke aaropon kii jaanch shuru kar di he
 Kirit Somaiya, a BJP MP and petitioner in the case, says, "there is a charge of buying cheap shares at expensive prices
" videshon main paise lagane kaa aarope he
 It is suspected that the money has been received as a kickback
 'tippaniyan Meanwhile, Chhagan Bhujbal has accused the ACB of defaming him by giving false information about him in the press
 chagan bhujabal ne aarope lagaaya ki chapa maarane ke baad asibi ne kai gharon ke aakaar or keemat jaan boojhkar badha chadhaakar bataai he
 Bhujbal has said in his clarification that most of the property is inherited from ancestors and ancestors
 idhar dilli main maharashtra sadan ghotla or kalina main bhukhand ghotaale kii jaanch kar rahi asibi ab is padtaal main lagi he ki chagan bhujabal par aay se adhik sampatti kaa maamla banataa he yaa nahin
 But surprisingly, the one who has so much immovable property, no movable property was found from his house in the raid

 But surprisingly, the one who has so much immovable property, no movable property was found from his house in the raid

 bijepi saansad or maamle main yachika daayar karne vaale kirit somaiya kaa kahana he, 'isamen saste share mahange damo main kharidne kaa aarope he
 He is accused of putting money abroad
 shaq he ki ye paise kik back ke taur par mili hai
 Comments is bich chagan bhujabal ne asibi par press main unke bare main galat jaankaree dekar badnaam karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Chhagan Bhujbal alleged that after raiding, the ACB has deliberately inflated the size and price of many houses
 bhujabal ne apni safai main kaha he ki jayaadaatar sampatti paitruk or purakhon se mili he
 ACB, which is probing the plot of scams in Maharashtra Sadan Ghotla and Kalina in Delhi, is now investigating whether Chhagan Bhujbal has a disproportionate assets case
 lekin hairaani kii baat he ki jiske paas itani achal sampatti he, chaape main uske ghar se koi bhi chal sampatti nahin mili

 No cash, no FD, no shares nor jewelry? jammu-kashmir se jude centre sarkaar ke tazaa faisalon par soshal media kii pratikriya dekhie to lagegaa ki hindustan ne jaise jammu-kashmir par koi jeet hasil kii he
 There is such an atmosphere of happiness as it is when defeating Pakistan in cricket
 baqayada gambhir samajhe jane vaale lekhak bhi jaise lalkaar kar kah rahe hai ki lo hataa di gayi vivaadaaspad dharaaen, ab kuch kah kar dikhaao
 In fact, the arrival and passage of a stream in Kashmir is not as worrying, it is more dangerous than that
 beete kuch dashakon main aisa maahaul banaaya gay jisamen anuchhed 370 (jise bijepi dhara 370) kahati he) koi sanvaidhanik praavdhaan bhar nahin rah gaya, ek aisa bhaavnaatmak mudda ban gaya jiske aadhaar par baaqi bharat main vot padate or bantate rahe
 Apparently, this situation also happened in Kashmir
 yahaan kashmir ko lekar jitna shor machataa rahaa, kashmir inch-inch kuch or dur khisakta gaya
 But try to understand the situation
 kashmir kaa vishesh darja khatm karne kaa matlab kya he? kaha ja rahaa he ki ab kashmir main har bhartiya plot kharid sakegaa
 The situation is that common Indians are unable to save their old houses and houses, they are selling their farms and houses in small towns, taking loans from banks and somehow taking flats in metros
 ve apana doosraa plot kashmir main lenge- yah haasyaaspad khyaal bas ek lachar daleel se zyaada kuch nahin banaata
 Of course, some industrialists will get the benefit of it and it will also reap the benefits of a few Kashmiris, but what it will cost to Kashmir and the whole country - it is difficult to calculate it now
 jo sarkaar bas is vishesh darje ko khatm kar dene bhar se vikaas kii subah aa jane kaa daawa kar rahi he, usase poocha janaa chahie ki jin ilaakon main use kahin bhi jane-zamin kareedne-skool banane- udyog lagane kii chhot he, vahaan vikaas kaa sach kya he
 Why are farmers forced to commit suicide? Why are youth unemployed? Why are children forced to die from malnutrition? However, avoiding this digression, return to Kashmir
 kashmir kya baaqi bharat se isliye alag tha ki vahaan anuchhed 370 lagu tha? aise anuchhed or bhi rajyon main hai jo vahaan ke sthaneey logon ko vishesh haisiyat dete hai
 In Jharkhand, you cannot buy the land of tribals
 himachal main bhi zamin kharidne par pabandi he
 Actually, the historical truth is that it is Article 370 that connected Kashmir with India
 thik he ki yah asthaayee dhara thi, lekin iske khatm hone kii shart yah thi ki ise kashmiriyon kii aakanksha se khatm kiya jayega
 It was believed that as Indian democracy becomes stronger, this current between Kashmir and the rest of India will go wrong and will one day be forgotten
 ramchandra guha ne apni kitaab 'india aafter gandhi' main is baat kaa zikr kiya he ki kashmir kii samvidhan sabha main sheikh abdulla ne jammu-kashmir ko lekar teenon vikalpon kii baat kii
 He said that given the kind of forces Kashmir is surrounded by, it cannot remain independent
 pakistan main jane ke vikalp ko unhone is aadhaar par kaarij kiya ki vahaan ke samant or zameendaar kashmir ko chodenge nahin
 Sheikh Abdullah said that he hoped from Nehru that he would be able to defeat the stifling forces here and Kashmir has a future in India
 guha kii kitaab yah bhi bataati he ki yah sheikh abdulla the jinhone kashmir se kanyakumari tak kaa vah naaraa diya tha jo aaj bhi bharat kii ekta ko pradarshit karne ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 How this belief was crushed in the coming days is a long and painful story
 iske khalanaayak bahut saare log hai- vah sangh parivaar bhi jisane vahaan shyama prasad mukherjee ko andolan ke liye bheja, vah congress bhi jisane vahaan chunaav ke naam par barason tak tamaasha kiya or apane pitthu bithaae or kashmir ke ve netaa bhi jinhone algaavvaad or aatankwaad ko apane munaafe ke kaarobaar main badal liya
 But the insistence on correcting old historical mistakes with new historical mistakes shows that even after so many years of democracy, you have not been able to understand how countries are formed and how nations are strengthened
 ve kaanoon kii dhaaraon se nahin, janata ke sapanom se banate hai
 The kind of governmental system that has run in Jammu and Kashmir in the last few days, it seems as if we are dealing with a colony, not with an equal part of our own country
 100 saal pehle jaise british sarkaar bharatiyon se pesh aati thi, usee tarah bharat sarkaar bharatiyon se pesh nahin aa sakati
 If you make a decision by detaining the leaders of a state, enforcing Section 144 in the state without any provocation, closing the school college in one part of the state, then you know that the decision will not embrace the public
 is
 lekin aap logon ko samajhane, apane saath jodne kii koshish nahin karte, un par apana faisalaa thopane kii koshish karte hai or kuch is tarah karte hai ki is par baaqi bharat ithlaata-khilakhilaataa he
 By doing this, you are actually doing away with Kashmir
 daraane vaali baat yah he ki sarkaar anuchhed 370 hataane kii koshish main na janamat kaa dhyaan rakh rahi he na kanoonee baadhyataaon kaa
 The constitutional position is that it cannot be removed without the permission of the Constituent Assembly of Kashmir
 sarkaar ne pehle ek adhisuchana jari kar samvidhan sabha kii shaktiyaan jammu-kashmir vidhansabha ko saunp deen
 Its logic can still be understood because now there is no existence of Constituent Assembly
 lekin iske aage centre sarkaar kaa tark dilachasp he
 She says that since there is no Legislative Assembly, her powers are vested in the Lok Sabha and the Lok Sabha can decide on her behalf
 kahana mushkil he, yah daleel kisi nyaayik samiksha main khari utregi yaa nahin
 However, the solution to Kashmir is not easy, it has its own complexities
 lekin itihaas kaa iklauta sabak yahi he ki aisi samasyaayein jor-jabardastee se nahin, antat samvaad se hal hoti hai, janata kaa collar pakad kar nahin, uske haath tham kar hal hoti hai
 The author of these lines is not an expert of Kashmir
 lekin yah samajhane ke liye kashmir kaa visheshgy hone kii zarurat nahin he ki itane bade faisale agar janata ko saath lekar nahin kiye jate to ve nae sankaton main badal jate hai
 Those who are really separatists will also get this decision because it will give the same propaganda that they have been doing for years
 yah samajhane ke liye or visheshgy hone kii zarurat or kam he ki kashmir ke badlaavon ko lekar jo utsavi maahaul he, vah kashmir ko kuch or udhaas or maayoos kar rahaa hoga
 Actually you do not love Hindustan or Kashmir - you love a fake patriotism in which the noise of slogans is more, the truth is less
 fasiwad par barason pehle likhe apane ek lekh main umberto iko ne kaha tha ki abhivyakti kii azaadi kaa matlab 'rateric'- shabdadambar- se bhi azaadi he
 But we rejoice in freedom of rhetoric
 praha main soviet sainikon ke jane ke baad jo maahaul tha, use milan kundera ne 'carnival of het'- bataaya tha- kashmir ko lekar ghrinaa kaa yah mahotsav aap har taraf dekh sakate hai
 It is difficult to say what will cause much damage to Kashmir - the removal of Article 370 in Kashmir, or the stream of happiness flowing in the rest of India

 Whenever tv's most popular shows in India are mentioned, 'taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashma' will also be named in the top list
 is sho kii jitani tarif kii jaae utani kam he
 Needless to say that the show which has been running for 10 years has achieved a different place in the world of TV
 kuch yun ki tarak mehta kaa ulta chashma ke har ek kairactor ne logon ke dil or dimag par gahari chhap chodi he
 But after watching the show for the last few days, it seems that this show is slowly losing its charm
 jaahir si baat he ki in dinon sho kii popularity feeki pad rahi he
 The plot running in the show seems to fail to impress the fans
 tiarapy main giravat ek duusari baat to he hi
 But the thing to think is why is this happening? 8 together the whole family
 30 baje tivi ke aage baithne ke liye majaboor karne vaala sho, ab beasar sabit ho rahaa he
 However, the show has received many setbacks in the past
 dedh saal se sho kii femes kirdaar dayaban (disha vakaani) kaa gaayab hona, doctor hathi kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahe actor kavi kumaar aaazaad kii achaanak maut ho janaa, sonu kaa role play karne vaali actress nidhi bhanushali kaa sho chhodana kuch aise points he jisane serial par asar daalaa he
 The show's makers are busy trying to save it from the downfall
 lekin jo koshish philhal sho ke episods main dikh rahi he wo naakaafi he
 The show shows clothed plots
 kabhi-kabhi to yun lagata he jaise sho apni tag line 'hasante rahiye, khush rahiye' se bhatak rahaa he
 Earlier, every function was shown in a very spectacular way, it was fun too, but now the punch of the show is not seen in the script
 pehle serial kaa ek-ek dialog hansane ke liye majaboor karte the ab puure episod main hansane ke liye dialog dhundhane padate hai
 In the past, the show featured many absurd plots
 jabardastee chizon ko rabar kii khinchaa ja rahaa he
 In the name of outdoor tour, the plot of the characters moving around in a city like Singapore also proved to be cold
 ab to popatlal kii shaadi or sapane vaala trek bhi bejaan najar aa rahaa he
 The disappearance of two-three characters from the show, such as the laughter of the serial, seems to disappear
 sho ke jaise halaat hai usamen serial ke produsar asit modi ke liye apane phens ko baandhe rakhana behad mushkil dikh rahaa he
 Seeing the way the show's storyline is going, it is also feared that Dayaben's return will also prove to be ineffective
 comptishan ke is daur main asit modi ko sho ko bachaane ke liye nayaapan laana jaruri ho gaya he
 Because many more shows on TV these days are standing up to give a tough competition and in such a situation, the audience easily shifts to other shows
 dekha jaae to sho kii script main vakt rahete badlaav kii jarurat ho gai he, taaki tarak mehta apane charm ko barkaraar rakh sake or ise pasand karne vaale kattar darshakon ke manoranjan kaa jaayaka bana rahe

 sampurna bharatvarsh main naksalwad kii samasya rashtriya str par lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 Naxalism is an ideology and the followers of this ideology are now attacking the democracy, putting Indian democracy in danger
 isaki misaal 11 march 2014 or isse pehle 25 may, 2013 ko jhiramghati kii naksali hamale kii ghatnaayen hai
 In last year's event, 32 people including Chhattisgarh state's top Congress leaders Mahendra Karma, Nand Kumar Patel, Vidyacharan Shukla were martyred
 isse puraa desh shok main tha
 Due to this incident, people all over the country were scared
 aisi visham paristhiti main hamaare parivaar ne dhairya kaa parichay diya
 i do not know what the governments of the states of India, which are facing Naxalism, are thinking to solve this problem, but i believe that in the states where there is a problem of Naxalism, the governments have a strategy for development in the region
 Under it, education, employment and basic facilities should be provided
 naksali unheen kshetron main pair pasaarte hai jahaan kii bhugolic sthiti unke makul he or vahaan kii aabaadi ashikshit he
 The situation today is very incredible
 duurastha kshetra kii aabaadi sarkaar ko dhundhati he
 They do not get government, but Naxalites are easily found in the ravines
 meraa maananaa he ki hindustan ke har antim vyakti tak sarkaar pahunche taaki naksalwad kaa ant ho
 The aim of Naxalism was to envisage a public war against the regime
 aaj iskaa arth sirf chanda ugaahi or policeblon par hamalaa karke hathiyaar lootnaa he
 The Naxalites want the tribals to remain illiterate and not progress
 naksalwadiyon ke inhen mansoobon ko sthaneey adivasee samajhane lage hai
 The issue of external Naxalites and local Naxalites had arisen among the Naxalites in the past years
 ab adivasee bhi samajhne lage hai ki naksalwad kaa yahaan se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Imported Naxalites of the neighboring state are misleading the tribals here
 apane aapako adivaasiyon kaa hitaishi bataane vaale naksali pichley 40 saal se bastar sambhag ke adivasee kshetron main sirf chanda ugaahi kar baahar le ja rahe hai
 Now they have started collecting taxes only from the toiling tribals here
 adivaasiyon ko daraa-dhamkaakar apane saath milaanaa or unke bacchon ko choti umr main hi naksali vardi pahana dena inaki manodasha ko ujagar karata he
 For every season of the year, tribal-dominated areas are proving to be a good market for raising / donating
 jal, jangal or jameen kaa naam lekar ye adivaasiyon ko nirantar chal rahe hai or unka shoshan kiya ja rahaa he
 Whether it is the tendu patta season or the second season, Naxalites have to pay some part of everyone's earnings
 desh main adhikansh naksal prabhavit kshetra adivasee ilaakon main hi hai, jahaan khanij sampada or prakritik sansaadhan prachur maatra main hai
 Naxalites also have vulture sight on them
 in kshetron main lagane vaale udyogon kaa ve pehle to virodh karte hai or baad main in udyogon se hi naksaliyon ko chanda miltaa rahata he
 It is a canker for democracy and internal security of the country
 samay rahete iskaa samaadhaan atyant jaruri he
 My father (self
 mahendra karma) kaha karte the, ‘‘main raajnneeti main jitun yaa haarun magar naksaliyon se hameshaa ladata rahoonga
 i believe that there should be no politics in the solution of the Naxalite problem
 ’’itane bade loktantric desh main bandook kii nok par satta hasil karne kii baat karnaa naksaliyon kii maansik veikshiptata ko darshata he
 Many intellectuals who believe in Naxalite ideology, "salwa Judum" and Green Hunt etc
 have been misrepresented in front of civilized society, which has already died before reaching its end
 jabaki ukt donon abhiyaanon ko bhole-bhaale adivaasiyon ko naksaliyon ke bhraamak jaal se nikaalane ke liye shuru kiya gaya tha
 There is a need to first stop the spread of Naxalism as a solution to Naxalism and curb their white-collar supporters, urban networks and local helpers
 naksalwad ke khilaaf maujuuda kanoon naakaafi hai
 There are hundreds of companies of Central Police in Naxal-affected areas, but the ruling party is in defensive mode due to lack of will to eradicate the Naxalites
 isse naksali samasya lagaataar badhati hi ja rahi he, saath hi central police kaa manobal bhi gir rahaa he
 Naxalites are taking advantage of this
 rajya sarkaar shuru se hi naksal unmoolan kii disha main kargar kadam uthaati to pichley saal or phir pichley hafte jiram ghati main itani bady ghatana na ghatati
 Many big Naxalites are also taking advantage of the rehab policy
 kai naksali ise ritairement plan ke rup main dekhte hai
 Whose plan was liked, surrendered before him
 aajkal to bade ohadedaar naksali iskaa phayda uthaa rahe hai
 Police and administrative system in Naxalite affected areas need to work honestly
 saath hi janata dwaara chune gaye janpratinidhiyon kii bhi naksal unmoolan main ahm bhoomika honi chahie
 After all, how long will we let this bloody war continue? (the author is the son of Congress leader Mahendra Karma who was killed in the 2013 Naxalite attack in Jeeramghati) rajasthan kenagaurmendalitasamaj ke logon ne badi sankhya main ikattha hokar apni takat kaa ahsaas karaayaa he
 In fact, under the banner of All India Ambedkar Mahasabha for the past 46 days, the people of Dalit community here were sitting on hunger strike with their demands

 Legislator Hanuman Beniwal also reached; Independent MLA Hanuman Beniwal, who was engaged in forming a third front in the gathering of Dalits, gathered in thousands
 beniwal ne yahaan pahunchakar tisare morche ke liye samarthan maanga or daliton ke haq ke liye ladaai ladane kaa bharosa dilaayaa
 Describing the government as insensitive, he said that the central and state governments of the Bharatiya Janata Party have not been able to do anything so far for the poor, Dalits and backward classes
 unhone aage kaha ki ye sarkaar pichde varg ke logon ko dabaane kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 Explain that thousands of people reached the hunger strike and dharna of Dalit society

 The Allahabad Bench of the Allahabad High Court has given a big order on the Scheduled caste-tribe (SC / ST) Act case
 SC / ST act yaa phir anya kanoon jisamen saat saal sajaa yaa usase kam he, us ke tahat aropiton kii routinegiraftarper naaraazgi jaahir kii he
 The court said that without complying with the provisions of the RPC, one cannot arrest four people accused of assaulting Ekdalit Mahila and her daughter
 hoicourt ne supreme court ke 2014 ke ek faisle kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki 7 saal se kam sajaa ke maamalon main aaropee ko giraftaar se pehle notice dekar poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa jaae
 If the accused complies with the terms of the notice, he will not be arrested during the investigation
 court ne kaha ki aise maamalon main siarpisi kii dhara 41 or 41e kaa paalan karne kaa aadesh diya he
 Direct arrest is possible only when it is necessary
 bataa den ki hoicourt ke justise ajay lamba or justise sanjay harkauli kii bench ne ye baaten SC / ST act main centre sarkaar ke adhyadesh ke baad 19 agast ko darj ek exiaar ko rad karne kii maang vaali yachika kii sunwaayee ke dauraan kahi

 hoicourt ne kaha ki is maamle main giraftaar se pehle arnesh kumaar banaam bihar rajya ke cese main supreme court dwaara die gaye 2014 ke faisle kaa paalan kiya jaae
 With this, the court disposed of the petition
 supreme court ne anaresh kumaar maamle main faisla diya tha ki yadi kisi ke khilaaf darj praathmiki main aparaadh kii adhiktam sajaa saat saal tak kii he, to aise maamle main siarpisi 41 or 41e ke praavdhaanon kaa paalan kiya jayega
 The investigator must first ensure that the arrest is unavoidable, otherwise the judicial magistrate will not seek judicial remand of the arrested person

 supreme court ne aisi pratha par gambhir aapatti jataai thi
 The court cited the amendment in CRPC-41 as saying that in cases where the sentence is seven years or less, it is necessary to be judicious before arresting why arrest is necessary? The court had said that if the accused comes for questioning and complies with the terms of the notice, he will not be arrested during the investigation
 endie ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ke khilaaf chunaav ayog ke aadesh ke baad gujarat sarkaar ne do exiaar darj kar lee hai
 The Election Commission has said that Modi has violated two sections 126 (1) (a) and 126 (1) (b) of the Representation of People Act
 isse pehle congress ne chunaav ayog ko shikaayat kii thi ki narendra modi ne gandhinagar main apana vot daalane ke baad jis tarah se press conference kii he, vah adarsh aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan he
 Hence an FIR should be lodged against them
 chunaav ayog ne is shikaayat par turant karrwai kii
 Also, the Gujarat government was instructed to inform by 6 pm whether action has been taken
 chunaav ayog ne modi kii press conference ko dikhaane vaale tivi channelon ke khilaaf bhi exiaar darj karne ko kaha
 Narendra Modi has reacted sharply to this
 unhone kaha he ki jivan main pehali baar unke khilaaf koi exiaar hui he or vah is din ko kabhi nahin bhuulenge
 Modi said that if someone is threatened with a knife, pistol or gun, then the FIR against him is understandable, but the FIR was lodged against him because he showed the lotus flower to the people
 iske liye unhone congress par hamalaa kiya he
 Modi said at an election rally in Tirupati that the Congress was scared of selling tea
 modi ne ek baar bhi chunaav ayog kaa naam nahin liya or exiaar ke liye sidhe congress ko hi zimmedaar tehraaya he
 The bjp's alleged insult to the constitutional institutions committed by the Congress has made a big issue in this election
 upie sarkaar ke khilaaf apni chargeshit main bhi bijepi ne congress par sivisi, sieji or chunaav ayog jaisi sansthaaon ke saath chhedchhad karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 This is the reason why Modi does not want to be seen standing before the Election Commission regarding the FIR against him
 haalanki gujarat main apane shuruaati daur main vah chunaav ayog se do-do haath kar chuke hai
 He had targeted the then Chief Election Commissioner JM Lyngdoh for delaying the state elections in 2002
 lekin bijepi netaa chunaav ayog kii karrwai or uski raftaar par jarur sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 However, he is not ready to say much about this openly
 party netaaon ke mutabik, narendra modi ne adarsh aachaar samhita kaa koi ulanghan nahin kiya he
 The BJP claims that Modi interacted with journalists two hundred meters away from the polling booth
 jahaan tak press conference kaa sawaal he, yah ek aam baat he ki vot daalane ke baad tamaam netaa patrakaron se baatcheet karte hai
 In terms of security, a separate arrangement was made for Modi, which it would not be right to name the press conference
 modi ne raajnneetik masalon par apni baat tabhi kahi jab unase is bare main patrakaron ne sawaal puche
 BJP leaders also say that putting the election symbol on lotus is not a violation of the code of conduct
 unki daleel he ki jab tak chunaav chinh ke saath us par vot dene kii apil na kii jaae, yah samhita kaa ulanghan nahin mana ja saktaa he
 Agents of political parties can sit at polling booths with election symbols
 aam aadmi party ke kaaryakarta or netaa jhaadu ke chunaav chinh vaali tapiyaan lagaakar vot dene jate hai, jabaki sonia gandhi or manmohan singh vot daalane ke baad haath hilaate hai, jo unki party kaa chunaav chinh he
 The BJP is also questioning the interpretation of the term 'election material' mentioned in those sections of the Representation of People Act
 party kaa kahana he ki uske ghoshnaptr jari karne ke vakt bhi isi shabd ke tahat sawaal uthaae gaye the or media ko telecast karne se rokane kii baat kahi gai thi, jabaki koi bhi raajnneetik dal kisi bhi vakt apana ghoshnaptr jari kar saktaa he
 However, law experts are rejecting the bjp's objection
 unke mutabik, chunaav ayog ne 9 april ko ek aadesh main kaha tha ki kisi raajnneetik dal ke chunaav chinh vaali topi, shawl yaa kapadon main koi poling booth par nahin ja saktaa
 After casting his vote, Modi made political statements which were shown on TV and this may affect voters
 modi apane haath main puure vakt bijepi kaa chunaav chinh camel liye hue the or laharaate rahe, jo ek tarah se party kaa prachaar karnaa hi kaha jayega
 As such, there is a provision of up to two years of punishment for violation of these sections of the Representation of the People Act
 par aise maamle durlabh hai, jinamein yah sazaa hui ho
 Therefore, it will be interesting to see what action is taken against Modi going forward in this case
 yah zarur he ki is vivaad se modi ko ek tarah se phayda hi hua he, kyonki kal matdaan ke din vah tivi par chhaae rahe or vah bhi apana chunaav chinh camel laharaate hue

 In an exclusive interview with Aaj Tak, PM Modi said that demonetisation has raised the biggest attack on black money and increased tax
 jab piem modi se sawaal kiya gaya ki aapke virdohi notebandi ko sabase badi chook bataate hai
 Do you consider demonetisation as the biggest success or a lapse? PM Modi said, 'I did not do demonetisation to win elections
 haalanki uttar pradesh kaa vidhansabha chunaav hamaare virdohi notebandi ke mudde ko lekar lade the, lekin janata ne unke munh par aisa thappad maaraa ki wo notebandi kaa naam nahin lete hai
 He said that even now opposition leaders sometimes cry about demonetisation, because everything has been lost due to demonetisation
 notebandi ke baad mantriyon or baabuon ke ghar se bore main note nikle
 One lakh 30 thousand crore rupees were exposed from demonetisation
 unhone kaha ki hamane 50 hajaar karod rupee se zyada kii benami sampattiyon ko jabt kiya
 More than three lakh fake companies were locked up, due to which the business of billions and trillions in each room was closed
 piem modi ne notebandi ke phaayde ginate hue kaha ki isse aazaadee ke itane saal baad jitna tex rate tha, wo doguna ho gaya he
 The reason for this was that after demonetisation, people felt that it is now difficult to operate in the country due to black trade and black money
 lihaaja eemaandaaree ke raste par chalanaa chahie
 Demonetisation has led to such a huge attack on black money that there has been a big change in the mentality of the country
 isse arthvyavastha ko bhi bahut bada phayda hua
 This has also reduced inflation
 notebandi se logon main jaagarukta ai he or kalaadhan rakhane waalon ko pakadaa ja rahaa he
 PM Modi said that the absence of inflation during his tenure is a symbol of a strong economy
 saal 2014 main upie ke satta se baahar hone kii vajah mahangaai dar badhanaa bhi tha
 Modi also dismissed the criticism of his government over demonetisation and GST implementation
 arthvyavastha ke prabandhan ko lekar piem modi ne puri tarah se santosh jataayaa
 When asked that opposition parties allege that PM Modi discusses surgical strikes and Balakot air strikes to deviate from demonetisation, farmers' problem and GST
 is par piem modi ne kaha, 'agar mere har bhaashan ko dekha jayega, to main unamem kisaan, bijli, sadak par bhi bolta hum or rashtriya suraksha ke mudde par bhi bolta hum
 If i have a 40-minute speech, i speak 3 to 4 minutes on the issue of security
 'unhone kaha ki desh kii suraksha ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Taking a dig at the Congress, PM Modi said that the Congress calls the army chief a goon of the road
 unhone sawaal kiya ki aakhir congress ne suraksha ke mudde ko darkinar kyon kiya? mudra yojana ke sawaal par piem modi ne kaha, 'mudra yojana ke tahat saadhe chaar karod logon ko pehali baar bank se lone mila
 On the question of employment, he said that if the road is built and development takes place, is the road built without employment? He said that two IT companies recently said that they have given jobs to 400 times people

 The trend of finding love online has increased among women, women who are outspoken are not hesitating to go ahead and express love to men
 kuch baras pehle tak online dating karne waalon ko hikaarat bhari najaron se dekha jaataa tha, lekin ab yah ek trend ban gaya he
 According to an estimate, now one out of every five relationships is starting online, which is why there is a flood of online dating apps
 america or europe main stablish kai badi dating companiyaan bharat main kaarobaar khadaa kar rahi hai
 One of these is 'bumble', in which Priyanka Chopra has also invested recently
 'bombal' dating ap ko mahila pradhan ap kaha ja rahaa he, jisaki apni vajahen hai
 In response to this, its co-founder Whitney Wolfe says, "there is always some skepticism about online dating, especially among women
 isliye bharat main mahila shashaktikaran ke moto ke saath ap ko launch kiya gaya he
 "number of people using 'bumble' worldwide" 4
 5 karod se adhik he
 How are dating apps becoming female-dominated now? Responding to this, the feminist Gita Ashti says, "bumble has revolutionized the field of dating apps
 is dating ap main mahilaon kii suraksha or confort ko dhyaan main rakhkar kai behtareen fitures taiyaar kiye gaye hai
 For example, women can be the first to initiate on this app
 agar kisi ladke ko kisi ladki kii profile pasand bhi aa gai to vah use massej nahin kar paaegaa

 In 2014 itself, Tinder co-founder Whitney Wolfe started Bumble, a female-oriented dating app
 1990 ke dashak main online dating ek stigma tha lekin ab ek-tihaai shaadiyaan online hi ho rahi hai
 'bumble' has written the tagline on its website, "women first step on Bumble
 ham aapke liye maidan taiyaar kar rahe hai or dating ke tareeke badal rahe hai
 We believe that relationships should start with respect and equality
 "'vu dating' ap dwaara haal hi main karaae gaye surveykshan ke mutabik, is tarah kii online dating ap par mahilaon or purushon ke bich langik bhedbhaav bahut zyada he

 haalanki, is langik vibhaajan se sirf mahilaon ke liye hi nahin, balki purushon ke liye bhi samasyaayein khadi ho gai hai
 The problem for men is that they do not have a lot of online options, while the problem of women is that they have so many options that they find themselves surrounded
 is bare main gita kahati hai, "agle 10 saalon main mahila, purushon main yah antar kam hone ja rahaa he, kyonki is dauraan doguni raftaar se mahilaayein online dating ap kaa rukh karengi, jo is khai ko bahut had tak mitaa degaa

 Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) chief Ajich Jogi, who is challenging the bjp-congress in Chhattisgarh, himself will not contest the assembly elections from any seat in the state
 jogi kii party, bahujan samaaj party or bhartiya communist party ke mahagathbandhan ne faisla kiya he ki unki ore se mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar or purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi kisi seat se chunaav nahin ladenge
 Party general secretary Abdul Hameed Hayat said on Friday that the grand alliance workers had been raising questions on the subject among the Grand Alliance officials for the past few days that the chief ministerial candidate needs to focus on Bastar seats in the first phase
 And that is why this decision has been taken immediately
 sabhi siton par karenge prachaarunhone bataaya ki is vishay par gathbandhan ke sabhi varisht netaaon evam padaadhikariyon ke bich aaj charchaa hui or yah nirnay kiya gaya ki mahagathbandhan ke mukhyamantri pad ke pratyaashee ajit jogi ko kahin se bhi chunaav nahin ladaaya jayega balki 90 siton main saghan prachaar karaayaa jayega
 Giving the reason for this decision of the grand alliance, the leaders of the grand alliance said that Ajit Jogi himself would be free to contest elections if the JCCJ contested alone on 90 seats
 lekin mahagathbandhan hone ke vajah se unke dauron, sabha or prachaar kaaryakramon kii sankhya dogani ho gayi he or isliye ab unka samay sabhi 90 vidhansabhaon main pramukhataa se bantna chahie
 Hayat said that if Jogi will fight in one seat, he will spend more time campaigning in that single seat, which may cause the Grand Alliance to suffer losses in Bastar and other places
 isi vajah se mahagathbandhan ke kaaryakartaaon or padaadhikariyon ne yah nirnay kiya he ki mukhyamantri pad ke pratyaashee ajit jogi ko kisi bhi seat se chunaav na ladaaya jaae
 On this decision of the Grand Alliance, Ajit Jogi said that he will run as per the decision of the Grand Alliance
 mahagathbandhan ke baad utpann paristhitiyon or unki sabhi 90 siton par saghan aavashyaktaa ke anuroop yah nirnay liya gaya he
 This decision is an important step towards forming the Grand Alliance government in Chhattisgarh

 dilhicongresski kaman sanbhaalane ke liye lagata haishila dikshithkhema phir puure jorshor se maidan main he
 If Congress President Rahul Gandhi's close aide and Delhi Congress President Ajay Maken offered resignation citing poor health, mobilization has intensified in the party to hold the post of President
 dilli congress adhyaksh kii kursi sanbhaalane ke liye shila dikshit kheme kii ore se koshishen tej kar di gai hai
 The leaders of the camp associated with Sheila Dixit, who was the Chief Minister of Delhi three times, have met State In-charge PC Chacko and asked that Sheila should be handed over the command of the state once again
 sutron ke mutabik, shila kheme ne haal main un netaaon kii baithak bulaai jo khud ko pradesh adhyaksh pad kaa daavedaar maanate hai, saath hi or bhi kuch bade netaaon ko bhi bulaayaa
 Leaders like Subhash Chopra, Mahabal Mishra, Jaikishan, Yogananda Shastri, considered among the contenders, were called to the meeting
 saath hi jagadish titalar or mangatraam singhl jaise netaa bhi isamen shaamil hue
 In this meeting, the claimants have expressed their claim, but at the same time agreed that if she is given the command of Sheila Dikshit, the big face of Delhi Congress, then she is ready to support
 khud ko daavedaari se dur maanane vaale jagadish titalar or mangatraam singhl jaise netaaon ne bhi shila kii purajor vakaalat kii

 The leaders of the Sheila camp informed the state in-charge PC Chacko on Monday evening
 saath hi kaha ki wo chahen to baithak main shila ke haq main raay dene waalon se alag alag baat kar sakate hai
 Sheila Khema is also giving these arguments on her behalf
 shila sarkaar us vakt dilli main haari, jab kejariwal or modi lahar chal rahi thi or desh bhar main congress ke khilaaf jabardast maahaul tha
 Now people are remembering Sheela's work after passing time
 2
 Sheela is a big face, make them a team by making 4 working presidents like the rest of the states
 3
 Just as Kamal Nath, who is more than 72 years old, can be given the command of Bengal in Madhya Pradesh and 75-year-old Somen Mitra, in the same way, the old Sheela should be given the command of Delhi
 haalanki, haaron yusuf or arvinder singh lavali sareekhe netaa is baithak se dur rahe
 At the same time, veteran leader Sajjan Kumar and former president Jayaprakash Aggarwal have taken a stand by putting the ball in the high command's court, that we will be with whom the high command will make

 In such a situation, the ball is now in the high command's court
 uske paas teen vikalp hai
 The first is that while keeping Maken intact, 2 or 4 working presidents can be made with Sheela's consent
 doosraa ye ki shila ko kaman dekar maakan kii sahmati se 2 yaa 4 varking president bana die jaaen
 And the third is that a new team can be formed by concurring with the consent of both Sheila and Maken

 Where is it appropriate to hang after so many years? is desh main kai logon kii faansee kii sajaa ko umrakaid main tabdeel kiya gaya he
 Why is Jacob quick to hang himself? While Shoaib Khatib, a trustee of a mosque in Bhindi Bazaar, says he has surrendered, he should have made a concession with him

 bihar main mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar he or is sarkaar kaa sanyog he ki qareeb 20 varshon tak ek duusare ke ghor virdohi rahe nitish kumaar or lalu yadav satta main sahyogi hai
 For the first time, Lalu Yadav considered Nitish Kumar the leader of the grand alliance
 ye baat lag he ki ye qadam unki raajnneetik majaburi ke kaaran uthaanaa padaa
 But on Saturday, a new novel channel showed the conversation of Siwan's Dawn and now former MP Mohammad Shahabuddin and his party president Lalu Yadav in one of the hotspots
 shahabuddin, lalu yadav se sivaan ke espi, saurav shah kii shikaayat kar rahe hai
 Apart from this, there are two more audio clips in which Shahabuddin is talking to his supporters and in one clip talking about the bdo's voice
 is audio clip ke saarvajanik hone se nishchit rup se raajnneetik toofaan dilli se patna tak shuru ho gaya he
 There is no doubt that even the staunch supporters of Lalu Yadav have no reason to believe that Lalu Yadav is compelled to speak to the convicted people like Shahabuddin
 haalanki chaara ghotaale main lalu yadav khud doshi paae gaye hai or bel par baahar chal rahe hai
 If Lalu Yadav's conversation was inaccurate and illegal, then it is also true that it is the police of Bihar who keep their mobile phones on record on the infamous, convicted criminals jailed and Shahabuddin may be the leader of the ruling coalition
 But the police did not show any kindness towards them
 lekin sab jaanate hai ki lalu yadav kii sari mushkilon main adhikansh galat logon ko sangrakshan dene ke kaaran yaa pairvi main kisi ko phone laga dene ke kaaran ab tak hui hai
 It is believed that Lalu Yadav is not going to improve with his habit, that is why his difficulties are not ending
 vipakshi bhaajapa ke netaa susheel modi kaa aarope he ki nitish kumaar ab lalu yadav ke saath gathbandhan ke kaaran sakht rukh nahin akhtiyaar karte
 However, BJP leaders believe that since 2005, after Nitish Kumar came to power, the decision to set up a special court or speedy trial against notorious criminals like Shahabuddin, especially in more than half a dozen cases
 It was a mistake in the political status rather that the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha are far away after the November 2005 elections
 The discharge also find Shahabuddin won their supporters from their influence
 lalu, nitish ke ek saath aane se pehle ye dharna ghar karti ja rahi thi ki agar sivaan kii raajnneeti main aapke upar shahabuddin kaa haath he to haar nishchit he kyonki voton kaa dhruvikaran ho jataa tha
 It is far from anyone's understanding that in the same jail where jailer once gave a chair to Shahabuddin, a Bihar police officer beat him to the extent that even today RJD leaders believe that the waist He has not recovered from the pain
 iske alaava jail main khaaskar unke ward main chhapemari aam baat ho gai thi
 After the formation of the Grand Alliance government once again, when the court began to be held in the jail and its photos went viral, the officers of the jail were in awe
 shahabuddin apni is raajnneetik durgati ke liye nitish kumaar ko doshi maanate hai or isaliye pichley saal jail se nikalne ke baad unhone pehla nishaanaa nitish kumaar par ye kah kar saadhaa ki wo paristhitiyon ke netaa hai or sab jaanate hai ki shahabuddin ke waapas jail jane main is ek vaktavy ne sabase adhik bhoomika nibhaai
 Later, when the matter of sending the Tihar jail to the Supreme Court came, the state government did not delay in giving its consent
 ye baat alag he ki shahabuddin dwaara nitish par die gaye vaktavy par lalu aaj tak maun hai jo unki raajnneeti or abhi tak shahabuddin ke prati unke ehsaan ke kaaran hai
 The comments shahabuddin, agar lalu yadav ko phone kar kisi kii shikaayat yaa fariyaad karte hai to uske peeche kai raajnneetik kaaran hai lekin sabase pramukh he 2000 ke wo 7 din jab nitish kumaar kii itane hi dinon kii sarkaar bani thi or congress ke kai vidhayak nitish ke liye apana paala badalane kaa man bana chuke the
 Most of the mlas were stationed at a hotel in Patna and Shahabuddin was then supervised by those mlas and tasked with thwarting Nitish's plan
 ye baat kisi se chhipi nahin ki shahabuddin ne is kaam ke liye puure desh se apane samarthak aparaadhiyon ko jamaa kiya tha or tab patna police main apni vardi se zyaada lalu yadav ke prati unke swajaateey nishthavan adhikariyon ne is kaam main unki madad kii
 Nitish Sarkar had to go and Lalu Yadav bowed down in front of Shahabuddin, the process continues even today
 lekin aaj kii bihar kii raajnneeti kii sachaai he ki sivaan main vahi police adheekshak hai jinhen shahabuddin khatm bataa rahe hai or bidio bhi apane pad par virajman he keval esadio kaa tabadalaa uske pramotion hone ke kaaran hua he
 This fact speaks about the relationship of Nitish, Lalu and Shahabuddin and their political status in today's Bihar
 is audio clip ke saarvajanik hone se nishchit rup se raajnneetik toofaan dilli se patna tak shuru ho gaya he
 There is no doubt that even the staunch supporters of Lalu Yadav have no reason to believe that Lalu Yadav is compelled to speak to the convicted people like Shahabuddin

 This fact speaks about the relationship of Nitish, Lalu and Shahabuddin and their political status in today's Bihar
 agar lalu yadav kii baatcheet galat or gaiyrkanoonee thi tab saath-saath ye bhi sach he ki ye bihar kii police he jo jail main band kukhyat, sajayaftaa aparaadhiyon ke upar unke mobile phone ko recording par rakhti he or shahabuddin bhale sattarudh gathbandhan ke netaa hon, lekin unke prati police ne koi narmi nahin barti
 But everyone knows that all the problems of Lalu Yadav have happened so far due to patronizing the wrong people or by calling someone in the lobby
 mana jaataa he ki lalu yadav apni aadat se sudharne vaale nahin, isi kaaran unki mushkilen khatm nahin ho raheen
 Opposition BJP leader Sushil Modi alleges that Nitish Kumar no longer takes a strong stand due to his alliance with Lalu Yadav
 haalanki bhaajapa ke netaa maanate hai ki nitish kumaar ne satta main aane ke baad 2005 se aparaadhiyon khaaskar shahabuddin jaise kukhyat aparaadhiyon ke kilaaf wo chaahe vishesh court banane kaa nirnay ho yaa spidi trial kaa, un faisale ke kaaran naa keval aadhe darjan se adhik maamalon main doshi qaraar hue balki raajnneetik haisiyat kii ye durgati hui kii 2005 november ke chunaav ke baad loksabhaa or vidhansabha to dur kii baat he nagarpalika chunaav main bhi shahabuddin apane samarthakon ko apane prabhaav se nahin jeeta pate
 Before Lalu, Nitish came together, the notion was going on that if Shahabuddin's hand is on you in the politics of Siwan, the defeat is certain because the vote was polarized
 ye baat kisi ke samaj se dur he ki jis sivaan jail main ek jamaane main jailer shahabuddin ko kursi dete the usee jail main bihar police ke ek adhikari ne unki pitayee is had tak kar daali ki aaj tak rajd ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki qamar ke dard se wo ubar nahin paae hai
 Apart from this, raids in the jail, especially in his ward, were common
 mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar banane ke baad ek baar phir jab jail main darbar lagane laga or uske photo viral hue tab jail ke adhikariyon par gaaj giri
 Shahabuddin blames Nitish Kumar for his political misdemeanor and so after getting out of jail last year, he first targeted Nitish Kumar by saying that he is the leader of the circumstances and everyone knows that Shahabuddin is going to go back to jail
 a statement played the most role
 baad main sarvocch nyaayalay main jab tihaar jail bhejne kaa maamla aayaa tab rajya sarkaar ne apni sahmati dene main koi der nahin kii
 It is different that Lalu has remained silent on the statement made by Shahabuddin on Nitish due to his politics and his favor to Shahabuddin till date
 tippaniyan Shahabuddin, if Lalu Yadav calls and complains about someone, there are many political reasons behind it, but the most prominent is the 7 days of 2000 when Nitish Kumar's government was formed for the same number of days and many Congress mlas for Nitish Had made up his mind to change his face
 adhikansh vidhayak ko patna ke ek hotel main tehraaya gaya tha or us samay shahabuddin ke upar un vidhayakon kii nigaraanee or nitish ke yojana ko vifal karne kaa zimmaa diya gaya tha
 It is not hidden from anyone that Shahabuddin had collected his pro-criminals from all over the country for this work and then his self-styled officers of Lalu Yadav more than his uniform in Patna Police helped him in this work
 nitish sarkaar ko janaa padaa or shahabuddin ke saamne lalu yadav natmastak ho gaye ye silsilaa aaj bhi jari he
 But the truth of today's Bihar politics is that Siwan has the same Superintendent of Police whom Shahabuddin is saying is finished and BDO also occupies his post, only the transfer of SDO has happened due to his promotion
 ye tathy nitish, lalu or shahabuddin teenon ke sambandh or unki raajnneetik haisiyat aaj ke bihar main bayaan karti he

 adhikansh vidhayak ko patna ke ek hotel main tehraaya gaya tha or us samay shahabuddin ke upar un vidhayakon kii nigaraanee or nitish ke yojana ko vifal karne kaa zimmaa diya gaya tha
 It is not hidden from anyone that Shahabuddin had collected his pro-criminals from all over the country for this work and then his self-styled officers of Lalu Yadav more than his uniform in Patna Police helped him in this work
 nitish sarkaar ko janaa padaa or shahabuddin ke saamne lalu yadav natmastak ho gaye ye silsilaa aaj bhi jari he
 But the truth of today's Bihar politics is that Siwan has the same Superintendent of Police whom Shahabuddin is saying is finished and BDO also occupies his post, only the transfer of SDO has happened due to his promotion
 ye tathy nitish, lalu or shahabuddin teenon ke sambandh or unki raajnneetik haisiyat aaj ke bihar main bayaan karti he
 Nitish Sarkar had to go and Lalu Yadav bowed down in front of Shahabuddin, the process continues even today
 lekin aaj kii bihar kii raajnneeti kii sachaai he ki sivaan main vahi police adheekshak hai jinhen shahabuddin khatm bataa rahe hai or bidio bhi apane pad par virajman he keval esadio kaa tabadalaa uske pramotion hone ke kaaran hua he
 This fact speaks about the relationship of Nitish, Lalu and Shahabuddin and their political status in today's Bihar

 Former chief selector of Team India Sandeep Patil has made those revelations in an interview to a TV channel, which has exposed many controversial incidents within the team during his tenure
 is dauraan sandip patil ne purv test captain mahendra singh dhoni or master blaster sachin tendulkar par ek dhamaakedaar khulaasa kiya
 During this, Sandeep Patil also spoke about Dhoni's sudden retirement from Test cricket and at the same time he made disclosures on Yuvraj and Gambhir, which has been speculating in the media for many years
 ‘vanade se hataae jane vaale the sachin’is dauraan sandip patil ne ek aisa khulaasa kiya jisase puraa hindustan us daur main anjaan rahaa
 In 2012, the selectors had discussed the removal of Sachin Tendulkar from the Indian team
 patil ne kaha, ‘disambar 2012 main ham sachin tendulkar se mili or unase unke bhavishya kii yojana par baat kii
 There was no talk of retirement in Sachin's mind then
 lekin tab chayan samiti main sachin par ek sahmati ban gai thi or board ko isaki soochna bhi de di gai thi
 By then, Sachin had understood what the selectors wanted and in the next meeting he said to take retirement from ODI
 ’patil ne kaha, ‘agar tab sachin khud ritairement lene kaa man nahin banaate to ham nishchit hi unhen drop karne vaale the
 However this happened in two years and not in a day or a month or a year
 sachin 2013 main ritair hue
 "discussed the removal of Dhoni from captaincy" Sandeep Patil also revealed during this time the selection committee also discussed the removal of Mahendra Singh Dhoni from captaincy
 unhone kaha, ‘beshak hamane is par (dhoni ko captaini se hataane par) sankshipt charchaa kii thi lekin hamane sochaa ki iske liye samay sahi nahin he ki kyonki 2015 world cap paas main he
 He said, 'we felt that the new captain should be given some time
 world cap ko dhyaan main rakhte hue hamane dhoni ko captain banaae rakhaa
 i believe Virat got the captaincy at the right time
 viraat chote formet main bhi team kii aguwai kar saktaa he lekin ab iskaa faisla nai chayansmiti ko karnaa hoga
 Surprised by Dhoni's announcement of retirement, Patil described Dhoni's decision to retire from the Test as a surprise as the team was battling in Australia at the time
 unhone kaha, ‘vah mushkil siries thi
 i would not say that Dhoni was the captain of a sinking ship but things were not going to suit us
 aise main hamaara ek senior khilaadi sanyas kaa faisla karata he
 It was surprising but in the end it was his personal decision
 ’‘dhoni ne nahin kiya yuvi, gauti ko baahar’is dauraan patil ne yah bhi saaf kar diya ki is baat main koi dam nahin he ki yuvaraj singh or gautam gambhir jaise senior khilaadiyon ko team se baahar kiye jane main dhoni kaa haath tha
 He said, 'I was hurt by such reports in the media, in which reports were written that Yuvi and Gotti were removed because of Dhoni
 ’unhone kaha, ‘unhen team se baahar karne kaa faisla puri tarah se chayankartaaon kaa tha tathaa dhoni ne gambhir or yuvaraj ko baahar karne ko lekar koi baat nahin kii
 The two captains never opposed a player
 ’‘dhoni-kohli main koi mail nahin’is dauraan purv chif selector sandip patil se yah bhi poocha gaya ki dhoni or kohli kii captaini ko wo kaise dekhte hai to unhone kaha, ‘captaini ke maamle main donon do chor par khadey hai
 One is at the orth pole and the other at the south pole
 sabhi captain apni khud kii team bananaa chaahate hai
 At the same time, they also recognize the potential of their team
 viraat engri yang main hai lekin wo apni aakraamakata par niyantran bhi rakhte hai
 Dhoni remains calm but always talks about what is going on in his mind

 He later clarified that only a part of his statement was shown in the media throughout the day
 darasal, mohan bhagwat ne balaatkaar kii badhati ghatnaon par ajeebogareeb bayaan diya
 During a meeting in Silchar, he attributed the events to the impact of Western civilization
 mohan bhagwat kaa kahana tha ki ye 'bharat' or 'india' kaa asar he
 They say that such incidents happen more in cities, because the western civilization is affected by the people there
 bhagwat ke mutabik 'bharat' main aisi ghatnaaye nahin hoti hai
 Later, Mohan Bhagwat in a way only blamed the media for this episode
 unhone kaha ki unke bayaan ko tod-marodakar pesh kiya gaya
 Also only one part of his statement was highlighted
 isse pehle mohan bhagwat ne china ko bharat ke liye khatra bataaya tha
 He said that the way China is increasing its influence around India, once again the danger is increasing

 Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Nand Kumar Nandi has given a controversial statement
 phulpur kii chunavi raily main nand gopal gupta ne mukhyamantri kii maujuudagi main mayawati ko shurpanakha or mulaayam singh yadav ko ravan bataaya he
 The minister did not stop here, he called the Chief Minister of Delhi as Marich
 yogi ke mantri ne apane bhaashan main kaha, 'aapkaa naam mulaayam hoga or aap rajya ke mukhyamantri honge
 Then Kumbhakaran said
 
 
 he prabhu! meraa kya naam hoga? tab prabhu ram ne kaha, aapako log shivpal ke naam se janenge or aap hameshaa rajyamantri hi rah jaaenge
 He said on Akhilesh Yadav, 'then Meghnath went ahead smiling and said, o Lord! i am the crown prince
 tab prabhu ram ne kaha ki tum bhi yuvaraj hi rahoge, tumhaara naam akhilesh hoga
 You will become the Chief Minister of the state in the year 2012 by fooling the people, cheating once
 tum is vansh ke aakhri shaasha ke rup main jane jaaoge
 'after this, he targeted BSP chief Mayawati and said,' Hearing this, when Ram started going back, Shurpanakha came to him and said, Prabhu what will happen to us? You have destroyed my whole family
 ab meraa kya hoga? bhagwaan ram bole tum kaliyug main meri ayodhya par raaj karogi
 At that time your name will be Mayawati but marriage will not be yours at that time either
 'is dauraan unhone dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii tulana mayavi marich se kar daali
 With Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati's decision to contest alone 11 seats in the by-election in Uttar Pradesh, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has given a big boost to the party's performance in the Lok Sabha elections
 Gave a statement unhone (akhilesh Yadav) kaha ki yah ladaai duusare kism kii thi, jise vah samaj nahin paae
 Akhilesh Yadav, who came to thank the public after he was elected as an MP from Azamgarh, said in a public meeting that in the Lok Sabha elections, there was a fight between an absconding car and a bicycle
 sab jaanate the ki faraari jeet jaaegi
 The Lok Sabha election was not held on issues, it has happened on some other things
 unhone (akhilesh Yadav) ishaaron main sapa kii haar kaa thikra media ke sir phodte hue kaha ki bataaie har din tivi par koun dikhataa tha, kiskaa tivi tha? ve hamaare dimag main tivi or mobile se khele
 It was a different type of fight, we could not understand this fight
 jis din ham is ladaai ko samaj jaaenge us din jeet jaaenge
 Akhilesh Yadav said that the adversaries are very powerful but the effort to beat them through social alliance will continue
 is dauraan unhone (akhilesh Yadav) kaaryakartaaon kii hatya ko lekar pradesh sarkaar ko katghare main khadaa kiya vahiin yah daawa kiya ki party ko seat bhale hi na mili ho lekin uskaa hausala barkaraar he
 The SP president said that those whom we have to fight are very powerful, which we cannot imagine
 magar, jis samay shashan or prashasan anyaay karne lage, desh or samaaj ko chhod apni tarakkee main jute jaye tab hamaari jimmedaari bad jaati he
 He (akhilesh Yadav) said that we and Bahujan Samaj Party partners will fight together for the fight for social justice
 akhilesh ne kaha ki unki party bhale hi chunaav haar gayi ho, lekin ham virdohi dalon ko chunauti dete hai ki ve apni sarkaar main karaaye gayi vikaas kaary or hamaari sarkaar ke vikaas kaaryon kii tulana kar len
 Their work will not last
 gauratlab he ki somvaar ko basapa pramukh mayawati ne upi main hone vaale up-chunaav main sabhi 11 siton par akele hi chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya tha
 Be aware that the Samajwadi Party has got only 5 seats in Uttar Pradesh and the BSP, which could not win a single seat in the last election, got 10 seats
 is nattejey ke baad samaajawaadee party main andar hi andar is baat kii charchaa kii thi ki bispi kaa vot sapa ko transfar nahi hui he
 SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav had already expressed this apprehension and his point was proved right
 gauratlab he ki basapa ke saath gathbandhan ke baavjood samaajawaadee party ko mahaj paanch siten hi mili hai
 Not only this, the family members of Kannauj, Badaun and Firozabad, which are called the fort of SP, lost the election
 kai logon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki gathbandhan ke seat bantwaare main mayawati ne man mutabik siten le leen
 From the tone of exchange of votes, SP was second in 2014 in the 10 seats where the BSP has won
 isi kaaran sapa ko asafalataa mili
 The equation was in favor of SP on Nagina, Bijnor, Shravasti, Ghazipur seats
 doosraa kaaran gathbandhan kii camestry jameen tak nahin pahunchi
 Seeing the crowd in the meetings, he felt that our votes would be transferred to each other
 lekin aisa hua nahin
 "mayawati knew that SP had a good hold on Muslim voters because of Mulayam
 iskaa phayda mayawati ko hua
 Mayawati took the winning seats into her account

 By giving half the seats to another party, the district or block level leaders of that party in that area started seeing their future dark
 " in sabakaa parinaam yah hua ki sapa kaa vot pratishat 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke 22
 This time down from 35 percent to 17
 96 fisadi rah gaya
 The percentage of BSP was also reduced, but its votes were converted into seats

 (input-ians) aaj release hui he 'ghanchakkar', jisamen mukhya bhoomikaayen nibhaai hai, vidya baalan, imran hashmi, rajesh sharma or namith das ne
 
 
 The story of the film revolves around Imran Hashmi and his wife Vidya Balan
 
 
 imran film main rajesh ke saath milakar bank lutate hai or faisla kiya jaataa he ki paison kaa bantwaaraa teen maheene baad kiya jayega, lekin inhen teen maheenon ke dauraan imran kaa accident ho jaataa he, jisamen unki yaaddaasht chali jaati he
 
 
 He also forgets where he has kept the loot money, and that is where the struggle to find money begins
 
 
 tippaniyan First of all, in the promos and promotions, 'ghanachakkar' was described as a comedy, so some similar expectations were raised by it, but the film did not make me laugh much
 
 
 mere hisaab se film kii script or screenple kaaphi kamazor he, isliye film mujhe lambii bhi lagi
 
 
 In the first half i felt that perhaps the film is being shown without an interval and is about to end, but alas, the interval happened
 
 
 film ko agar koi kuch had tak bachaa paaya to vah tha kirdaaron kaa abhinay
 
 
 According to me, the film needed some more spice to give it some momentum
 
 
 diarector rajkumaar gupta ne pehali baar kamedi film kerani chaahi, lekin mere hisaab se kaamyaab nahin ho paae hai
 
 
 The film's rating from me is - 2

 vah yah bhi bhul jate hai ki unhone lut ke paise kahaan rakhe hai, or bas, yaheen se shuru hoti he paise dhundne kii jaddojahad
 
 
 The comments sabase pehali baat, promos or promoshan main 'ghanchakkar' ko ek kamedi film bataaya gaya tha, so, kuch isi tarah kii ummiden isse lagaai thim, lekin film mujhe zyada hansaa nahin pai
 
 
 According to me, the script and screenplay of the film is very weak, so the film also took me a long time
 
 
 pehle half main mujhe lag rahaa tha shaayad film bina interval ke hi dikhaai ja rahi he or khatm hone vaali he, lekin afsos, interval hua
 
 
 If anyone could save the film to some extent, it was the acting of the characters
 
 
 mere hisaab se film ko kuch gati dene ke liye kuch or masala daalane kii zarurat thi
 
 
 Director Rajkumar Gupta wanted to do a comedy film for the first time, but according to me has not been successful

 The case that opened the secrets of depositing billions of rupees of old notes before and after demonetisation in Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank has reached the Supreme Court
 22 june ko supreme court main is babat yachika daakhil kar di gai
 The petitioner is Santosh Roy, an RTI activist from Mumbai
 roy par mumbai hoicourt ne galat daleelon or tathyon se adaalat ko gumraah karne kii koshish karne kii shikaayat manjuur karte hue jurmaana tak lagane kii chetavanee di thi
 Bombay High Court has dismissed the petition
 The Bombay High Court has rejected the PIL, which is investigating the deposit of more than 745 crore sixty lakh rupees within five days of demonetisation in Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank
 isse pehle yachika main roy ne pradhanmantri, vitt mantri or grih mantralay ko bhi pakshakaar banaaya tha
 On this, the lawyer of the Reserve Bank, terming the making of these three parties as absolutely unfair, called Roy's petition motivated by wrong motives
 in daleelon ko maanate hue adaalat ne roy ko chetavanee di thi ki un par aisi harkaton ke liye jurmaana tak lagaaya ja saktaa he
 At present, Roy, who has filed a petition in the Supreme Court, has argued that his case was not properly heard by the Bombay High Court
 lihaaja unhone us faisle ko supreme court main chunauti di he
 Even before the demonetisation, Roy had sought the details of the notes printed in the government raids to the Reserve Bank of India and to the Reserve Bank through the RTI
 jaankaree alag alag sroton se ai or unamem baari aniyamitata mili
 No account of 46 crore 93 lakh 16 thousand notes According to information received from RTI, between 2000 and 2011, 19 billion 45 crore 40 lakh notes of five hundred were sent by government raids
 lekin rigerv bank tak pahunche sirf 18 arab 98 karod 46 lakh 84 hajaar note
 That is, no account of where 46 crore 93 lakh 16 thousand notes went
 in gumshuda noton kii keemat 23 hajaar 465 karod rupee thi
 During the same period, the notes reached the Reserve Bank were more than the notes sent during the same period
 bheje gayi noton kii taadaad chaar arab 44 karod 13 lakh thi or rigerv bank ne bataaya ki uske paas pahunche chaar arab 45 karod tees lakh, yani ek karod 17 lakh note zyada
 Now there is no clue to the mystery of how the notes grew along the way
 philhal maamla supreme court pahunch gaya he
 It is expected to be heard in July
 ‘badale tumne rang bahut, badale bahut nakaab, faansee tak hamane tumhe laa hi diya kasaab’, pakistani aatankwadiamal aamir kasaabko di gai maut kii sajaa kii bombai ucch nyaayalay dwaara pushti kiye jane ke baad sarkari vakil ujjwal nikam kii kuch aisi ‘shairana’ pratikriya thi
 Describing Kasab as the 'villain of the gimmick' and 'the storm of terror', Nikam said that Kasab never showed any remorse after being caught
 yahaan tak ki usne apane ikbaalia bayaan main magistrate se is baat ko lekar pachhtaawaa bhi vyakt kiya ki vah siasti par deree se pahunchaa or iske chalate vahaan kam logon kii hatya kar sakaa
 Nikam, who led the prosecution during the trial, said, "kasab told the magistrate that he wants more terrorists to be ready to attack India
 usne jo kuch bhi kiya, uskaa use jaraa bhi afsos nahin tha
 'nikam said,' Kasab was taught by his bosses that if he is caught alive, then change his attitude so that the officers get confused
 usne apane aap ko avyask bataa kar adaalat ko gumraah karne kii bhi koshish kii, lekin hamane uski sari koshishen bekaar kar deen
 'nikam said,' Kasab is a trained commando and follows al-qaeda's methods
 al-kaayda apane aatankwaadiyon ko sikhaata he ki agar ve pakade jaaen, to adhikariyon ko gumraah karnaa shuru kar den 
 Kasab also adopted this method many times, whenever he was in difficult situations during the trial, then he tried to do the same
 ’nikam ke mutabik, kasaab kai baar apane bayaan se palata or ucch nyaayalay main apane liye america main mukadmaa chalaae jane kii maang karte hue usne sabko aashcharya main daal diya
 In response to a question, he said that Kasab never expressed his desire to go to Pakistan, although he demanded a trial somewhere outside India
 unhone kaha ki lashkar ne use aisi maang karte hue adhikariyon ko bhram main daalane kaa prashikshan diya tha
 a petition has been filed in a Pakistani court, asking that Kasab be sent there for trial
 is yachika ko ‘betuki’ bataate hue nikam ne kaha, ‘jab kasaab par bharat main mukadmaa chal rahaa he, to aisa kaise ho saktaa he
 Until his sentence is completed here, there is no question of sending him to Pakistan
 ’unhone kaha, ‘26 / 11 kaa mukadmaa mere liye chunauti tha
 Not only in the case of convicting Kasab, but also of masking off the face of Lashkar, who used Pakistan's security establishment to spread terror in Mumbai

 View this post on Instagram Do you ever feel terrified when you think about the distance between where you want to be and where you are? Krrish in many ways for me is the struggle, aspiration and endeavor of wanting to travel the length of that distance
 When my dad thought of the idea of Krrish , the first thing i felt was doubt, uncertainty and incapable, i was simply afraid, and the second thing i felt was absolute terror at the thought of not doing it because i was afraid
 So we went ahead and took the fear along with us for the ride
 What we lacked in budget, technology, specialization and resources , we made up in tenacity, teamwork, discipline and perseverance
 
 Today, we are at the heels of yet another endeavor to shorten that distance with Krrish4; and i feel exactly the same fear as i felt all those years ago
 
 And that is why i am reassured that we are on the right track

 bhartiya sena ko sansadhano kii killat hameshaa hi pareshaan karti he lekin yah tangi aise samay saamne aae jab duniya kii duusari sabase badi sena apana ab tak kaa sabase bada vistaar kar rahi ho or padosi desh museebataan khadi kar rahaa ho to maamla gambhir mode le saktaa he
 The Army's condition is very thin - the wartime reserve is at a very low level and the government has reduced the total expenditure due to less revenue, due to which the budget for modernization of the army which was already modest, also cut further this year
 has been done
 haalanki halaat nae nahin hai-saal-dar-saal, khaas taur par upie 2 ke dauraan mana ja rahaa tha ki vaayu sena ko badhaava dene kii keemat par thal sena ko nazarandaaj kiya ja rahaa he
 However, the present situation is extremely critical and the Army is building a Mountain Strike Corps with the intention of further strengthening its security front along the border with China without a suitable increase in budget allocation
 iske liye vah dhime-dhime 88,000 nai bhartiyon kar rahi he
 Now the danger is that it will be a difficult time for the army - its number force will increase, but the new force will not be equipped in that way due to the stalled plans for modernization
 iske mul main vah tarika he, jis tarah se pichley kuch saal main nai ikaiyaan khadi kii gai hai
 In an attempt to meet the deadline, all new deployments to the new Mountain Strike Corps have been done by truncating existing units
 hathiyaar, gola-barood or vaahan or bullate-pruf jacket sareekhee ve sahaayak samagriyaan bhi istemaal kar lee gayi jo aam taur par yuddh ke samay ke liye surakshit rakhi jaati hai
 In technical terms, the army has used its War Vestage Reserve (WWR) in the last four years to equip its new battalions along the China border
 vaise to apane aap main yah paripati koi nai nahin
 Traditionally, new battalions have been raised in this manner
 samasya yah he ki sena ko uski bharpai karne kaa mauka nahin mila or uskaa bajet aavanton lagbhag jas-kaa-tas rahaa he or bamushkil hi vah mudrasphiti ko bhi paat paaya he
 Technically, 88,000 personnel are being recruited without any proportionate increase in weapons, ammunition or infrastructure
 nai bataliyanon kii khatir jaruri kosh ke liye pichhali sarkaar ke saamne baar-baar guhaar lagaakar hataash hue sena kaa mukhyalay ek nayaa rodmap taiyaar karke nai jaruraton kii ore dhyaan aakrisht karne kii koshish kii he
 His complaint is very simple
 upie sarkaar ne nai kor khadi karne ke makasad se 5,000 karod ru
 Allotted the amount, but all this amount was adjusted from the current budget of the army
 sena mukhyalay ne ab uski bharpai karne ke liye ekamusth vishesh aavanton (5,000 karod ru
 ), Which is being considered by the Narendra Modi-led government
 aadhunikeekaran ke liye thal sena ne praathamikta ke aadhaar par saat kshetron kii suchi bhi banaai he
 These priorities include the purchase of new cannons (not a single new cannon has been purchased for the last nearly three decades), the inclusion of light helicopters for the aviation corps, upgrading them by installing night vision equipment in tanks and armored vehicles, and new assault for soldiers
 Buying rifles is included
 sena kii aadhunikeekaran kii prakriya se jude ek sheersh leftinent general bataate hai, ‘‘hamane vishesh aavanton ke bare main apana najariya saamne rakh diya he or lagata he ki use sweekaar kar liya jayega
 Senior Defense Analyst Brigadier (retd) Gurmeet Kanwal says that depletion of accumulated funds for war will adversely affect our defense preparedness
 unke shabdon main, ‘‘adarsh sthiti to yahi he ki nai bataliunen khadi karne ke liye hathiyaaron kii nai kharid honi chahie, lekin aisa nahin hone se yuddh kii sthiti ke liye rakhaa gaya rigerv kam ho gaya he
 Clearly, this would adversely affect the war's strength
 ’’haalanki aise samay main jab china or america samet sabhi pramukh takatein apane sainya bal kaa aakaar gata rahi hai, duniya kii duusari sabase badi sena ke vistaar ko lekar thodi bahes ho rahi he, lekin sena mukhyalay kaa maananaa he ki nai mountain strike kor purvi seemaa par suraksha ke liye nihaayat jaruri he
 In a session held in September last year with members of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defense, the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Philip Kampose, spoke very strongly about the need to improve the level of the army
 campoj ke shabdon main, ‘‘15 saal ke baad ke khatre kaa hamaara moolyankan jis sambhaavna par aadhaarit tha, usamen is baat ko dhyaan main rakhaa gaya tha ki china kaise aakraamak tareeke se padosiyon ke saath apane vivaadon ko sulajhaa rahaa he, khaas taur par dakshin china samudr main apane jaleey vivaadon ko
 We were trying to make sure that if China at any time tried to be aggressive by warming the atmosphere, then we are fully prepared to deal with that threat
 ’’ haalanki usee satr main vaais chif ne mana ki twarit samay-seemaa par khara utarane kii koshish main sena ne apane kuch arakshit bhandar kaa istemaal kar liya he
 This additional "burden" on resources has caused a severe setback to the military's financial planning, especially given that its revenue-capital budget ratio is already fairly imbalanced
 sansadhano ke apane salanaa aavanton main se is saal sena ko puunji kharch ke liye-apane javaanon ke liye nae hathiyaar or upkaran kharidne ke liye, bamushkil 22 fisadi mila
 The government was struggling to reduce its expenditure so much that for this year Rs 20,900 crore
 ke aavanton ko bhi or kaat-chhaantkar 4,500 karod ru
 (slightly over 20 per cent)
 rajasav mad main jane vaale 78 fisadi dhan main se bhi zyada to afasaron tathaa javaanon kii tankhwaah or bhatton main kharch ho jaataa he
 It is obvious that in such a situation, if the allocation is not enough, then there is only scope to cut all the items from ammunition
 raksha adhyayan tathaa vishleshan santhaan ke liye ek paper main raksha mantralay ke purv vittiya salaahkaar amit kushish ne likhaa tha, ‘‘sena ke rajasav aavanton kaa 60 fisadi se zyada tankhwaahon or bhatton main kharch ho jaataa he
 The remaining amount remains inadequate to meet the needs of other budget items, such as clothing, ration and fuel expenses
 natijatan aparyaapt aavanton kaa boj un kshetron par daal diya jaataa he jahaan sansadhano kii kami se tatkaal koi sankat khadaa hone vaala nahin he-hathiyaaron kii kharid unheen main se ek he
 "an unbalanced budget means that the military has little left to invest in new technology
" isi main sudhaar karne ke liye sena ne suzav diya he ki sarkaar raksha par desh ke kharch ko maujuuda ab tak ke nimnatam str jidipi ke 1
 Consider increasing by 7 percent
 bhartiya saansadon ko ek pregentation main sena ne raksha par kharch ko dhire-dhire badhaakar 3 fisadi tak le jane kii baat kahi thi
 With this, not only will the major shortcomings in modernization be bridged, but it will also be equal to the expenditure incurred by other countries
 kanwal kaa kahana he ki do morchon par jang ladgaye ke liye kam- se-kam 2
 An allocation of 5 per cent is necessary
 sena kii jaruratein puri karne ke maamle main sarkaar kaa imtahaan bhi jald hi ho jayega, jab vah agle vittiya varsh ke liye raksha kharch kaa aavanton karegi
 However, the Army is hopeful that the initiative towards reforms in this year's budget will be visible

 Sri Lanka batted first in the Super Over
 tim southi ne apane is over main acchhee gendbaaji kii or mahela jayavardhane, tisara perera or tillakaratne dilashaan ko boundry nahin lagane di
 In the meantime, he scored three wides which helped Sri Lanka to score 13 runs
 lecith maalinga ne yahaan par apni yarker kaa kamaal dikhaaya tathaa newjiland ko keval chah ran banane die
 Martin Guptill and Brandon mccullum had no response to Malinga's balls
 isse pehle donon tiimon kii paariyaan salaami jodiyon ke karishmai pradarshan ke ird gird gumti rahi
 For New Zealand, Nicole scored 58 runs off 40 balls with the help of three fours and four sixes and meanwhile shared a 57-run partnership for the first wicket with Guptill (38 off 34 balls)
 srilanka ke liye dilashaan (52 gend par paanch chauke or teen chhakkon kii madad se 75 ran) or captain mahela jayavardhane (26 gend par 44 ran) ne pehle wicket ke liye keval 44 gend par 80 ran kii saajhedaari karke team ko tufaani shuruyaat dilaai lekin newjiland ke gendbaajon ne gajab kii vaapasi karke match kaa taai kar diya
 It was the seventh T20 international match that lifted the tie

 srilanka ne jis tarah se shuruyaat kii thi usase lag rahaa tha ki vah aasaani se lakshya hasil kar legaa
 Ross Taylor made the bowling debut with spinner Nathan mccullum but Dilshan made his intentions clear with two fours and six in his first over

 Sri Lanka scored 68 runs in six overs of the powerplay, the highest in this tournament
 jaikab oram ne jayavardhane ko out karke newjiland ko pehali safalataa dilaai jinhone apni pari main teen chauke or itane hi chakke lagaae
 Sangakkara, who came to take the place of Jayawardene, hit fours off consecutive balls of Oram but he was run out in a tiff with Dilshan
 nae ballebaaj jivan mendis (8) adhik der tak nahin tik paae lekin dilashaan jame rahe
 When Sri Lanka needed 21 runs in two overs, Dilshan reduced the difference between the runs and the ball with a six off James Franklin, but he was run out in an effort to quickly steal a second run on the next ball
 isse pehle nichol or guptil ke alaava newjiland kii taraf se brandan maikulam ne 16 gend par 25 or captain rose tailor ne 15 gend par 23 ran banaae
 The specialty of New Zealand's innings was its batsmen playing openly against the spinners
 ajanta mendis puri tarah feet nahin the lekin unhen team main chunaa gaya
 He took 48 runs in four overs and took a wicket
 nichol ne unke ek over main teen chakke jadkar kul 24 ran batore

 Tim Southee bowled well in this over and Mahela Jayawardene, Tisara Perera and Tillakaratne Dilshan did not allow a boundary
 is bich unhone teen wide kii jisase srilanka 13 ran batorne main safal rahaa
 Lesith Malinga showed his yorker here and allowed New Zealand to score only six runs
 martin guptil or brandan maikulam ke paas maalinga kii gendon kaa koi jawaab nahin tha
 Earlier the innings of both the teams revolved around the charismatic performance of the opening pairs
 newjiland kii taraf se nichol ne 40 gend par teen chaukon or chaar chhakkon kii madad se 58 ran banaae tathaa is bich guptil (34 gend par 38 ran) ke saath pehle wicket ke liye 57 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 For Sri Lanka, Dilshan (75 off 52 balls with five fours and three sixes) and captain Mahela Jayawardene (44 runs off 26 balls) gave the team a stormy start by sharing 80 runs off only 44 balls for the first wicket but The bowlers of New Zealand returned the match and tied the match
 yah saatvaan tii20 antarrashtriya match tha jo taai chuta
 New Zealand has been a part of a record four tie matches
 usne super over main yah doosraa match ganvaaya
 The interesting figure of this match was that Jayawardene and Man of the Match Dilshan also completed 1000 runs in T20 international cricket during their innings
 jayavardhane is mukaam par pahunchane vaale duniya ke chauthe or srilanka ke pehle ballebaaj bane
 Dilshan touched the figure a short time later
 kumaar sangakaara (14 gend par 21 ran) keval 12 ran se aaj is mukaam par pahunchane se chook gaye

 Southee was targeted by both Jayawardene and Dilshan who conceded 30 runs in the first two overs
 srilanka ne powerple ke chah over main 68 ran batore jo is toornament main sarvaadhik he
 Jacob Oram made New Zealand's first success by dismissing Jayawardene who hit three fours and as many sixes in his innings
 jayavardhane kaa sthaan lene ke liye aae sangakaara ne oram kii lagaataar gendon par chauke lagaaye lekin dilashaan ke saath gafalat main vah ran out ho gaye

 If you are unable to impose a ban on betting, then recognize it
 yah kuch aisa hi he ki aap rape nahin roak sakate to use enjoy karne lago
 "it is difficult to get the ban implemented," the CBI director said, "if we can get lotteries done in some states, allow casinos in some places, when the government can come up with schemes to voluntarily expose black money
" What is the harm in recognizing betting? Saying a ban is easier than enforcing it

 (input agenciyon se) The worst days of bribery have come in Maharashtra

 Last year the figure was just 764
 asibi ne rishwatkhoron ko sirf range haath pakadaa hi nahin he, balki unke gharon se 133 karod rupee bhi baraamad kiye hai

 Not only this, what is the status of which case and which government has not yet got permission to prosecute which case, all such information is available on the website
 yahaan tak ki website par online shikaayat kii bhi suvidha he
 This is the reason that 1,230 cases of bribery were registered this year, under which 1,661 bribes have been caught and cash worth more than Rs 133 crore has been recovered from them

 Earlier, only where people could muster the courage to complain against small government employees, now people are coming against big babus and ministers too

 The condition of ISIS is something like these days
 apane hi ghar main buree tarah ghir chuke iesas ke ladaake bemaut maare ja rahe hai
 40% of the land under his possession has been taken away and death is dancing on the head of Baghdadi
 aise main apane dhahte kilon ko bachaane or duniya ko apni maujuudagi kaa ahsaas dilaane ke liye is aatankwaadi sanghathan ne ek baar phir se vahi puraani chaal chali he
 The trick is to scare the world with creepy videos of innocents being murdered
 iesaiemb apane hi garh main buree tarah ghir chukaa he
 Being caught in the Chakravyuh composed by more than 50 countries of the world, now the same executioners are being killed, who were wandering till death to the innocent till yesterday
 lekin bagdadi or uske gurgon ne apni ulti ginati shuru hote hi ek baar phir se apane jahrile daaton kii numaaish kii he
 Toothache
 or daant dehshat se banaae gaye propeganda videos ke
 Baghdadi is also being tortured, a terrorist is taking a headless head of someone unarmed, then some innocent person is being shot on his head by lying on his knees
 or kahin bamon se ladi puri kii puri gaadi bandhakon samet uda di jaati he
 Through this propaganda video featuring some similar pictures, these terrorists have challenged the world like new
 lekin jaankaron kii maane to ye video chunauti kam, balki haar se paidaa hui khiz zyada he
 Because the fact is that the number of ISIS militants surrounded by all-round attack is now less than its initial days and the anti-military forces have pushed it back from the 40 per cent of its occupied land, ie have regained possession of those areas
 aise main gurgon or rangaruton kii baat to dur khud aatank ke aakaa bagdadi ko bhi apane pakade yaa maare jane kaa khatra sataane laga he
 The terrorists are killing people mercilessly, so no date has been revealed to shoot this new video of ISIS
 lekin jaankaron kaa daawa he ki ye tasviren iraq ke anbar provins ilaake kii hai, jahaan abhi iesas raaj kaayam he
 And in this same province, pictures of innocent people being shot to death by Iraqi soldiers, government officials and spying suspects have been shot
 ek tasviir main iesas kaa ek jallaad haath main badi si kataar liye naarangi rang ke jampasoot pahane ek shaks kaa sir katata hua dikhaai de rahaa he, jabaki do alag-alag tasveeron main aatankwaadi logon ko sir main peeche se goli maarthe hue najar aa rahe hai
 And in these pictures, another terrorist of ISIS is seen standing with the flag of his organization
 inamen naarangi jampasoot vaale shaks par jahaan jasusi kaa iljaam he, vahiin jin do logon ko sir main goli maari ja rahi he, unamem ek iraq kaa sarkari mulajim he
 This is the most painful of these pictures, signifying the defeat of ISIS, in which a military in plain veneer is lying on the ground begging the terrorists to give their lives
 darasal, is video main aatankwaadi bandook liye uske peeche-peeche chalate najar aa rahe hai, jabaki faujee khauf ke maare jameen par bacchon kii tarah rengne ko majaboor he
 And in the same situation, creeping-creeks have been asking the terrorists
 lekin ye baat to bahut pehle hi saaf ho chuki in siraphiron kii dictionari main raham naam kaa koi lafj hi nahin
 And that is why this army is also killed at last
 lekin jaankaron kaa daawa he ki ye iesas ke haar kii nishaani he
 ISIS Countdown Begins Allied leadership in the ongoing war against ISIS says the Kurdish fighters and Iraqi forces have pushed ISIS militants far behind in cities such as Tikrit and Ramadi
 or in ilaakon main unki qamar puri tarah tut chuki he
 The special thing is that after the Gulf War, which lasted eight years, the US withdrew its army in 2011, but now it has again fielded 3870 troops for the elimination of terrorists and claimed that now The days of ISIS are counting
 saath hi, bhagwaan ganesh or bhairav maharaj kaa mandir bhi ban rahaa he, jiskaa kaam lagbhag aadha puraa ho chukaa he

 43 minute par chandrayan-2 kii lonching hogi15 july ko lonching se thik pehle roak diya gaya tha chandrayan-2cryogenic stage main ho rahi helium licage ko kiya gaya thikbhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan (ISRO) ne apane duusare moon mishan Chandrayaan-2 kii lonching 15 july ko launch se 56
 Stopped 24 minutes ago
 chandrayan-2 ko tadake 2
 The most powerful Bahubali rocket GSLV-MK3 was to be launched at 51 am
 lekin 56
 The countdown was stopped 24 minutes earlier because the GSLV-MK3 rocket had pressure leakage in the command gas bottle of the cryogenic stage
 isamen helium bharaa tha
 This works to keep the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen in the cryogenic engine cool
 helium licage kii vajah se mishan ko rokna padaa
 The pressure level of helium was not being formed in the bottle
 yah 330 point se ghatakar 300, phir 280 or ant main 160 tak pahunch gaya tha
 Hence the launch had to be stopped
 aaj tak ne 17 july ko hi bataa diya tha ki ISRO chandrayan-2 kii lonching 22 july ko karegaa
 ISRO will send rocket Chandrayaan-2 launch on this day, which was called off due to a technical snag on July 15, 2019, is now rescheduled at 2:43 pm IST on Monday, July 22, 2019 
 # Chandrayaan2 # gslvmkiii # ISRO— ISRO (@isro)july 18, 201915 july ke baad ab tak kya kiya isro vaigyanikon nevaigyanikon ne sabase pehle bahubali jieselvi-emke3 rocket ke sabhi stage se propalent (eendhan) nikaala
 The plan of ISRO scientists was that the entire GSLV-MK3 would be separated, but there was no need to do so
 sirf us hisse ko nikaalkar thik kar diya he, jisamen khami thi
 ISRO scientists have replaced the helium gas bottle
 saath hi us volve ko bhi thik kiya he, jisase pressure li ho rahaa tha
 a good thing that ISRO postponed
 
 
 varanaa antariksh main kho saktaa tha Chandrayaan-2aaj se agle kuch din kya karenge isro vaigyanipub se lekar agle teen dinon main isro kii analysis cameti helium gas bottle ko thik karne ke baad saare test ke parinaamon kii jaanch karegaa
 Also, the parts of the GSLV-MK3 rocket from which fuel was extracted
 iske baad rocket ke sabhi hisson kii essembling unit main le jaakar dobaaraa essembling kii jaaegi
 It will then be moved to Launchpad-2
 iske baad launch se kuch ghante pehle rocket ke vibhinn hisson main eendhan bharaa jayega
 There is also a possibility that ISRO scientists reduce the 5 rounds of Chandrayaan-2 around the earth to 4 after launching
 haalanki isamen eendhan thodaa zyada kharch hoga
 Reducing the Earth's orbit will save time for further travel
 abhi chand kii duuri thodi zyada ho gai he to aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki chand par pahunchane ke baad bhi vaigyanik chand ke chaaron taraf lagaae jane vaale chakkaron ko bhi kam kar sakate hai
 If it is not launched in four days, then Chandrayaan-222 will be postponed for 2 months on 2 July
 43 baje hogi Chandrayaan-2 kii lonchingaaj tak ne 17 july ko hi isro ke vishwast sutron ke hawaale se bataa diya tha ki isro vaigyanikon ne helium licage kii samasya ko thik kar diya he
 There are some tests left which will be completed by 18 July
 22 july ko dopaher 2
 There will be a launching at 52 pm
 aaj yani 18 july ko isro ne twit kiya ki 22 july ko dopaher 2
 Chandrayaan-2 will be launched at 43 pm
 chandrayan-2 kii lonching saat din baad ho rahi he isliye ab chandrayan-2 chand par 13 sitambar tak pahonchega
 If it is not launched on July 22, then it will be launched in september-october
 If the scientists do not launch on July 22 even after doing all the efforts, then launching of Chandrayaan is not possible in the next few weeks
 kyonki, yah launch windo khatm ho jaaegi
 The next launch window will come in September or October
 launch windo vah upyukt samay hota he jab prithvi se chand kii duuri kam hoti he or prithvi ke chaaron taraf chakkar lagane vaale upgrahon or antariksh ke kachare se takaraane kii sambhaavna behad kam hoti he
 Why the Moon Launching Launch window will be decided in september-october isro's Space Physics Lab at Trivandrum will be decided
 aglaa launch windo sitambar yaa oktober main milegaa
 Because during this time the distance of the moon from the Earth averaged 3
 61 lakh kimi hoti he
 If the launch of Chandrayaan-2 was successful on July 15, it would be around 3
 84 lakh kimi kii yatra kerani padati
 That is, about 23 thousand km more distance had to be traveled

 Janata Dal (united) spokesperson and Legislative Councilor Neeraj Kumar has tightened the Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Prasad Yadav's family on Wednesday
 unhone kaha ki agar lalu parivaar kii nirmaanadhin mal kii jameen ko paanch-paanch dismil prati vyakti ke hisaab se garib, daliton ke bich baant di jaae to 85 garib pariwaron kaa kalyaan ho jaataa
 He also said that the name of Tejashwi Colony would also be named as 'tejamisa-lara Corruption Colony'
 is naam se parivaar ke sadasyon kaa naam bhi amar ho jaataa
 He said that this would provide an education to the coming generation that corruption in public life is the cause of the downfall
 bataa den ki idi ne bihar ke nirmaanadhin mal ko sil kar diya he
 This land was given to the Lalu family in lieu of leasing two railway hotels
 kareeb 750 karod kii laagat se 115 kattha jameen main ban rahaa yah mal bihar kaa sabase bada mal bataaya ja rahaa tha
 Neeraj Kumar said, 'my advice to Lalu's son Tejashwi Yadav is that there is still time to distribute all the benami property of the family which is in many places of the country including Delhi, Patna and the poor
 vahaan 'tezmisa-lara bhrashtachar colony' banavaa dijie
 Otherwise, he will at least confiscate the law
 aise samay main koi bachaane nahin aayega, kyonki jab yah sampatti avaidh tareeke se arjeet kii ja rahi hogi
 Neeraj Nettejasvi said that like senior leader Ramchandra Poorve, do not insult anyone just because he did not give property to MLC, MLA, MP or your family to get a job
 varanaa, jivan main aise hi sampattiyaan sil ho jaaengi
