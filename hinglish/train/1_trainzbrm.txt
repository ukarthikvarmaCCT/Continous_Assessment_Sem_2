 Vinayak's hegemony is a unique event in today's power-seeking, money-ridden, violent world whose urge is to create pluralities instead of unity

 haalanki aankadon ko dekhe to beete kuch maheenon ke dauraan vaishvik str par kachche tel ke daam main ijaphe se zyada antarrashtriya mudra bazaar main dollar ke mukaable rupee main jari giravat jimmedaar he
 According to the recent Reserve Bank estimates, where the global crude oil price increased by $ 10 per barrel, the country's GDP growth 0
 15 fisadi kam ho jaati he
 At the same time, when the fiscal and current account deficit increases, the arithmetic of the central government starts deteriorating
 maujuuda samay main kendra sarkaar in donon dabaavon se guzar rahi he
 With this, the third most important change is being recorded in the dollar index, that is, the rupee is constantly weakening against the dollar in the international money market
 gauratlab he ki kachche tel kii kharid duniya ke sabhi desh apane videshi mudra bhandar main pade dollar se karte he
 Crude oil (in dollar terms) has become 28% costlier in the global market from January 2018 to October 2018 amid the current challenges
 vahiin kachche tel kii keemton ko rupee ke sandarbh main dekha jaae to is dauraan kaccha tel 48 fisadi mahangaa ho gaya he
 Understand from chart January 2018 2018 maximum% change in crude oil (in dollars) 60

 9028 Crude Oil (rs
) 3,8585,66947 Crude oil 60 in the global market in early 2018 as per the chart given above
 20 rupee prati dollar ke str par tha
 The highest level of crude oil in 2018 was 76
 90 dollar prati bairal par pahunch gaya
 That is, during this period, the price of crude oil increased by 28 percent in dollar terms
 vahiin rupee ke sandarbh main dekha jaae to janvari 2018 main 1 bairal kaccha tel kharidne ke liye bharat ko 3,858 rupee adaa karne pade
 At the same time, when crude oil was at the top level in 2018, India had to spend Rs 5,669 to buy crude oil per barrel
 lihaaja, rupee main kachche tel ko kharidne main bharat ko kul 47 fisadi adhik kharch karnaa padaa
 So, one thing is clear that if the rupee had not depreciated against the dollar after January 2018, India would have got crude oil as per the need by spending less rupees from its foreign exchange reserves by spending less rupees

 Looking for something deeper: This book by Rajni Guptarajani Gupta has some articles focused on feminine questions, some book reviews and some important interviews
 stri kii swadhinata or mukammal maanviya vajood se jude prashnon ne rajani ke samooche lekhan main aprihaary jagah banaai he
 Possible aspirations of half the population to live as human beings are their fervent aspirations
 vyapak samaaj kii ve phanken unhen sabase pehle dikh jaati hai, jahaan stri kii paravashtaa ke jatil arth gunthe pade hai
 In this book too, the readers will find the same impulsivity that gives an unintelligible heartbreak in the vibrant pulsed parts of the narrative
 in lekhon, samikshaon or saakshatkaaron main bauddhik suukhaapan nahin he balki alag-alag jeevanavritton ke kareebi dhadkate hue aise kathy hai, jinhen shaamil hokar samajhna jaruri ho jaataa he
 These include the lives of women who are said to be financially self-reliant, while the family members roaming around in the family circle, somewhere there are knocked-down old women for fathers, husbands and children, who have no neglected any corner of the family
 While the fatigue of a lifetime has riddled his body with diseases
 aisi ghaatak upeksha kii shikaar ye striyaan duniya se koi apeksha na karte hue sirf apane ant kii pratiksha kar rahi hai
 In these contexts, the writer has eroded the innocence of hollow families out of selfishness and opportunism
 rajani ke liye stri kii aazaadee kaa arth uskaa apni jameen par apane swapn or sangharsh ke saath nidhadak khadey hona he
 From here, the path opens up for meaningful possibilities of her personality and from here, a society of active understanding of men and women can be formed

 Emerging intentions and conclusions from various parts of the female life are recorded here
 in kitabon ko thahate hue lekhika ne jahaan unki rachanaatmakataa kii padtaal kii he, vahiin 'stri vajood' se jude sandarbhon kii sookshmataaon or nihitathon ko samajhna chaha he
 Here we can see that they focus more on the writers challenging the stagnation of understanding and experience
 in kritiyon se guzarakar lekhika nai stri kii shakti or sangharsh ko samajhna chaahati he, isliye stri daman kii prachlit sachaaiyon se baahar pade yatharth kii toh uske liye sambhav hui he
 In the 'dialogues' section there are interviews of Namvar Singh, Rukhil Verma, Maitreyi Pushpa, Archana Verma etc
 sambhawatah pehali baar namvar stri hiton ko sarvoparita main lene vaale prashnon ke nishane par hai
 Namvar ji has never taken the female discourse etc
 in hope or reassurance, but if he considers it a fashion-wonder, he is not surprised
 lekin is saakshaatkaar main ve stri kii vanchit sthiti ko gambhirtha se samajhte or uski mukti kii mukammal dharna ke bare main jimmedaari ke saath sochate dikhaai dete hai
 Rather, Rajni has also asked him very close and touching questions, whose names have been answered by Namwar, filled with the same kind of personal contacts
 pitrusatta, dharm, karmkand, sampradayikta vagairah kii jatiltaaon kaa sandarbh bhi yahaan aayaa he
 Outline Verma has understood them with full awareness
 prashnon kaa lagbhag yahi dhaancha archana verma ke saamne pesh hua he
 If seen, this book appears to aspire for the creation of a more open, rational and democratic society for the human independent existence of women

 'goalkeeper Wilfredo Caballero's performance in the match was also very poor and due to his mistake Croatia easily scored the first goal

 i think this defeat has exposed the truth of Argentina's team

 aam aadmi party sarkaar main purv mantri kapil mishra ne arvind kejariwal ko chitthee likhakar apane nilamban kii vajah poochi he
 Taking 12 questions one after the other, Mishra has also shared the party's constitution, which he has sent to all members of the Political Affairs Committee
 mishra ne 'aap' netaaon se 7 din ke bheetar jawaab maanga he
 On the other hand, if the sources are to be believed, the party had decided to suspend after receiving the complaint, a committee is currently investigating
 padhie kapil mishra kii arvind kejariwal ko likhi chitthee-aadarneey rashtriya sanyojakam aadmi partivishay - aam aadmi party kii PAC dwaara party samvidhan ke ulanghan, bina prakriya ke nilamban va niyamon kii avhelnaa par noticemahodaysarvapratham , ye ek notice he jo aapako va party kii PAC ke sabhi sadasyon ko bhej rahaa hoon
 The party's PAC under your leadership violated the party constitution, followed the procedures, without giving me any notice, without giving me an opportunity to say my way as my suspension was announced and even after that for about 2 months i have this notice in the context of not being given any notice and information in this regard
 kuch prashn :-1
 Has the decision to suspend me from party membership been made by the party's PAC? If yes, when was this decision taken, in which meeting? Please make all minutes in that meeting public
 2
 If the party's PAC has suspended me, then please tell me what was the complaint against me and who and when did this complaint to the PAC? 3
 party ke samvidhan ke anusaar kisi bhi sadsy ko nilambit karne kaa nirnay keval anushaasanamak kaarywahi pending hone kii sthiti main kiya ja saktaa he, jabaki mere khilaaf aaj tak bhi kisi bhi prakaar kii koi anushaasanamak kaarywahi nahi pending he
 4
 party ke samvidhan ke anusaar bina apni baat rakhane kaa avasar die, kisi ke bhi khilaaf koi anushaasanamak kaarywahi sambhav hi nahin, to mere bare main agar koi nirnay liya gaya he wo gaiyr kanoonee he
 What is the reason for making such illegal decision? 5
 party ke samvidhan ke mutabik kisi bhi sadsy dwaara apane swatantra vichaar rakhana , sadsy ke nilamban kaa kaaran nahin ban saktaa
 The main objective of the party is to raise voice against corruption and why i was illegally suspended when i raised my voice against corruption? 6
 main aapako bataanaa chahta hoon ki agar party kii PAC ne mujhe nilambit karne kaa nirnay liya he to ye gaiyr kanoonee he kyonkis
 i have done the basic objective of fighting corruption
 b
 No committee was formed for disciplinary proceedings against me, neither i was given any notice, nor was i given the opportunity to speak, nor any minutes of the PAC meeting on that day, what member said, what about this There was no voting in the PAC, no such information was given to me yet
 c
 All the provisions in the party's constitution for the suspension of the member have all been openly violated
 kya party PAC , party ke samvidhan se bhi badi ho gai he?7
 Was there any corruption case or complaint against me before the PAC while making such a decision? 8
 maine party ke rashtriya sanyojak ke bhrasht hone kii baat saarvajanik kii, unke rishtedaaron ke bhrashtachar main sanlipt hone kii baat bataai va sarkaar ke ek mantri ke bhrashtachar ke maamalon ko uthaaya, kya party ke samvidhan main ye koi gunaah he?9
 Despite declaring the suspension illegally, party convenor Arvind Kejriwal begs for my vote by issuing a whip in every session of the Vidhan Sabha
 10
 vidhansabha main mujhase vip dwaara party line par vot dalwane kii bheekh maangana va vidhansabha ke baahar gaiyr kanoonee tareeke se nilambit rakhana morrkhtaa nahin to or kya ?11
 i challenge you and all the members of the PAC to make public all the work, decisions and files made by me as a minister
 ek mukhyamantri ke taur par aap aisa turant kar sakate he
 i challenge that all the files of mine, yours and all ministers should be made public
 jo bhrasht sabit ho use party se nikaal diya jaae
 Tell me what you dare in the PAC of the common man party? 12
 main aapako va PAC ke sabhi sadasyon ko 7 din ke andar mere is notice kaa jawaab dene kaa samay detaa hoon or ye hidaayat bhi detaa hoon ki chand bhrashtachariyon ko bachaane ke chakkar me puri party ke samvidhan kii dhajjiyaan na udayi jaae
 Your Cupil Mishra kabhi kabhi sochataa hum, hindi kii mukhyadhara se sarthak lekhan karne vaale bahut saare lekhak kaise kaat die jate hai
 The mainstream of Hindi has been more ruthless about the writers of Bihar
 mujhe namvar singh kaa vah bhaashan aaj tis detaa he, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki renu jaise lekhakon ne hindi bhashaa ko bhrasht kar diya
 However, when i read the ghazals of the hindi-bhojpuri poet, literary serviceman Dinesh Bhramar, living in Champaran, read the comment of young writer Amitesh Kumar about him, the same pain started to come back again
 kya hindi kii mukhyadhara banaras se dilli tak hi he? philhal, dinesh bhramar par amitesh kii ek choti-si tippanee ke saath dinesh bhramar kii gazalen padhie
 - Prabhat Ranjanadinesh Bhramar started literature practice at a young age
 hindi main navagit ke shuruaati rachanakaaron main se ve the
 He is credited with writing ghazals for the first time in Bhojpuri; ghazals are a part of Bhojpuri literature courses
 dinesh bhramar ko pita ke dehavsaan ke baad ghar gruhasthi sanbhaalane ke liye gaanv lautnaa padaa
 In the teacher and family, he chose the family (also being the eldest)
 hindi ke mukhyadhara paridrishy main unki yaa un jaiso kii maujuudagi nahin milegi
 But living in a town town like Bagaha, he has made invaluable contribution in the creation of literary atmosphere
 yah us shahar or uske aas-paas ke shahar ke log jaanate hai
 He has continuously organized literary events in cities like Bagaha, Bettiah, Narkatiaganj, Motihari
 kavi sammelnon ke manch par unhone bade bade kaviyon ke saath manch saajha kiya he, jisamen ek naam agyeya kaa bhi he
 He has played a major role in the literary rites of the author of these lines
 bagaha main rahete hue maine bashir badr, shriram tiwari, sagar aazmi, nida fazli, wasim barelvi jaise kaviyon ko sunne kaa mauka paaya
 Attended several national level poet conferences
 bagaha main unki chhatrachhaaya main kai kaviyon ko panpane kaa mauka mila
 Many books were read from his library
 hindi kii patrikaon ke bagaha main ve kuch maatr graahakon main se he
 In spite of the poet's sharp talent and a strong grip on singing, if he did not become more popular in the landscape outside Bagaha, then not only his indifference is also responsible for the dominance of Hindi, which has deprived him of many such talents
 bhramar ji kii apni kavitaaon ko chhapavane main aruchi kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unki ek hi kavita sangrah chhapi ‘geet mere swar tumhaare’ lekin yah sangrah unke paas nahin he
 Poems written on sugar mills, newspapers, pieces of paper are also scattered
 unki sohabat ke kaaran unki sunai hui kavitaaon ko unke mureedon ne yaad kiya hua he
 These ghazals are also protected like this: 1
 har subah lagane lagi he, phir andheron kii tarah
 This twilight was deceiving us like morning
 shame se maathaa jhukaa jaataa, qutubameenar kaa
 Where primate fight, like pheasants
 aaj ke rishton kaa, koi kya bhala unwaan he
 Like when cousins are present
 aasteen main sabon ke hi, vifaille naag he
 Today humans seem like snake charmers
 gulmuhar sa surkh hota ja rahaa unka badan
 The body is turning yellow, like its connections
 2
 It was a rainy season somewhere
 jane kis yaad main nayan barase
 What is the dream of equality? kahin maati kahin ratan barase
 The smell of remembrance drops smelling
 aisa lagata he ki agan barase
 What a surprise in an instant
 kahin jivan kahin maran barase
 Glitter sandals in blue area
 maano akaash se kiran barase
 Sliding drops from black slugs
 jaise tham-tham ke koi dhan barase
 3
 apane milte he, ajanabi kii tarah
 It is difficult to live like a man
 kal sahaara tha jin anguliyon kaa
 Today arises like an index finger
 devtaa tha kisi kii najaron main
 Today i am a beggar like Bharthari
 chot itani he di jamaane ne
 i speak like a veteran
 saavnee baagmati wo nikle
 Those who used to understand like Gomti
 4
 The city looks like a stranger gaiyr jaisaa dikhe he ghar apana
 Do not share the heart with the country
 paas apane rakho hunar apana
 The whole sky became small
 itnaa ooncha tha kabhi sar apana
 Now he was afraid of his care
 kaat daalaa he khud hi par apana
 Whenever i am ghazal to say

 parivaar ke saath rahete hue jin ladakiyon ko dabl bed bhi chota lagata he, vahi ladkiyaan piji main aakar railway kii seat jitne chaude bed par sona sikh jaati hai
 Learned to line up for the bathroom
 man markar duusare kaa pasandida serial dekhnaa sikh jaati hai or saath hi bhaanti-bhaanti ke logon ke saath rahanaa sikh jaati hai
 Sometimes it is helpless to stay in PG, so many times the need
 aamtaur par jo ladkiyaan piji main rahati hai wo naukari karne ke liye apane ghar chhodkar aati hai
 Some also come for studies
 naukari karne vaali ladki ke man main jahaan do paise bachaane kii baat chalati he vahiin student ke liye maa-baap kaa boj kam karne kii
 In such a situation, most girls prefer to stay in PG
 vahiin jarurat kii baat karen to kai baar maa-baap khud hi beti ko alag room lekar nahin rahane dete
 Parents sitting away feel that anything can happen if the child remains alone
 piji main wardan yaa landlord to rahegaa hi saath hi kuch duusari ladkiyaan bhi rahengi
 In such a situation, it is better that the daughter be with some people than to be alone
 par beete dinon dilli ke ek piji main jo kuch hua, uske baad shaayad piji bhi dur baithe maa-baap ko surakshit na lage
 The case belongs to a PG from Delhi
 jahaan grajuation karne vaali ek ladki jab apane piji pahunchi to ek yuvak pehle se hi vahaan maujuud tha
 He took off his pants on seeing the girl and started doing pornographic activity
 ladki ne bhagkar khud ko ek kamare main band kar liya or landlord ko phone kiya
 The boy still stood there
 jab landlord pahunche to unhone ladke kii pitayee kii or use bhaga diya
 When the girl spoke about the police complaint, she refused
 saaf he ki iske peeche unhen badanaami kaa dar rahaa hoga
 But isn't this messing with the safety of girls? Many girls leave their homes and go to big cities because of jobs, studies or other needs
 aise main wo piji ko thikaana banaati hai
 These kinds of incidents really create fear
 aise main bahut jaruri he ki aadapni ore se puri saavdhaanee baraten
 If you are also looking for PG, then definitely check these things before you start living in PG
 1
 First of all, find out about the area where you have seen PG from nearby people
 baton-baton main aapako us piji ke bare main kaaphi kuch pataa chal jayega
 2
 jab aap piji dekhne jaaen to vahaan par pehle se rah rahi ladakiyon se baat jarur karen
 Ask them what problems they face while living here
 aap chahen to kisi ladki se uskaa number le len or tasalli se usase baat karen
 3
 landlord ko ye pehle hi saaf kar den ki ye ladakiyon kaa piji he or yahaan kisi bhi purush kaa aana alaud nahin he
 Whether it is his son or someone close to him
 4
 Check pg's bathroom, window and skylight thoroughly
 piji main safai ke liye koun aata he, khaanaa pakaane ke liye koun aata he, marammat ke liye koun aata he
 
 
 You should also have the details of all these things
 5
 Relations with Landlord should be good, but do not allow too much personal or allow them to happen
 6
 Also check the environment in the area where PG is located
 aas-paas kaise log rahete hai, iskaa asar bhi aap par padegaa
 In such a situation it is very important for you to know
 7
 Do provide PG address to your office, local relatives and family members
 vishwaasapaatr doston ko bhi adress note karaaen
 So that in emergency you get immediate help
 8
 If your PG is in a society, then also get in touch with the committee there
 apane mobile main sabhi jaruri numberon ko fast dial mod par seve karen
 9
 chaukanna rahanaa sabase jaruri he
 Be happy with girls living in PG but never tell them your personal things

 unki isi khubi ke kaaran kai log unki tulana unki daadi or purv party adhyaksh divangat indira gandhi se karte hai
 She will definitely rejuvenate the party workers and at the same time will also attract voters to the party
 congress netaa ne kaha ki pichley chunaavon main uttar pradesh main kaam karte hue vah prabhaavshaalee chhap chhodane ke saath hi sanghathan main anbhavi netaa ke taur par ubhari hai
 Asked about his interest in standing for the post of party president, 63-year-old Tharoor said, "I would honestly say that i don't think there is any possibility of speculating on this issue even remotely

 film nirdeshak deepa mehta kii web siries laila in dinon charchaa main he
 The story of this series is based on the future
 jisamen sabhyataa or samskruti ke naam par mahilaon ke shoshan ko darshaya gaya he
 The story of this film revolves around the main character Shalini Rizwan Chaudhary (huma Qureshi)
 is siries kii kahani saal 2047 ke samaaj ko darshaati he
 Where a powerful human being, Gurumata himself is a contractor of civilization and culture
 jo samskruti ke khilaaf jane waalon ko khud sabak sikhaata he
 Takes their lives
 darasal, is siries kii kahani dilli ke ek ashram or uske sanchaalak baba kii kahani se prerit najar aati he
 Which was revealed in December 19, 2017
 police ne vahaan chhapemari kii thi
 We are talking about the spiritual godly university of Delhi and its director Baba Virendra Dev Dixit
 jab uske ashram or karatuuton kaa khulaasa hua tha to har koi hairaan rah gaya tha
 In the name of imparting spiritual education in many cities of the country, she is surrounded by allegations of raping and physically abusing women and girls
 dhongi baba virendra dev dikshit ke kaale karname desh kii sabase badi jaanch agency sibiai ke liye bhi pareshaani kaa sabab ban gaye the
 The CBI had announced a reward of 5 lakhs on Virender Dev Dixit
 virendra dev dikshit aadhyatmik ishwariya vishvavidhyalay ke naam par ayyashi ke ashram chalaata tha
 Where the girls were forcibly held hostage and Baba sexually abused them
 peedit pariwaron ke kai din ke hangaame ke baad is maamle kii jaanch dilli hycourt ne sibiai ko saunpi gai thi
 In the Laila web series, an ashram-like society 'aryavrat' is also shown
 jiskaa sanchaalak to joshi he, lekin vahaan kaa sara kaam guruma (aarif zakaaria) naamak shaks dekhtaa he
 This character seems to be inspired by Virendra Dev somewhere
 jo aaleeshaan socity 'aryavrat' kaa pramukh he
 The secret of that is there
 siries main dikhaaya gaya ki apane dharm or samskruti ko tyagkar duusare samudaay main shaadi karne vaali mahilaon ko raste par laane ke liye guruma kisi bhi had tak ja saktaa he
 This is exactly the same as Virendra Dev used to treat the hostage women in his ashram
 guruma vaise hi mahilaon par atyaachaar karata he
 Makes them thrash
 unase socity ke saare kaam karaata he
 Virendra Dev used to exploit women in the name of imparting spiritual education in his ashram
 vaisaa hi is siries main dikhaaya gaya he ki kaise bhatak chuki mahilaon kaa shuddhikaran kiya jaataa he
 And they are exploited in the name of purification
 siries main dikhaae gaye kai vrutant dilli ke dhongi baba virendra dev kii kahani bayaan karte najar aate hai
 In one episode of this series of 6 episodes, Shalini stands from the roof of one building and throws stones at another building
 taaki koi vahaan se uski madad karne ke liye aage aae
 But no one comes
 aisa hi dilli ke aadhyatmik vishvavidhyalay main bhi hota tha
 The roof of the ashram was also closed with a grill there
 baavjood iske vahaan rahane vaali mahilaayein aas-paas ke gharon kii chhaton par madad kii aas main najar lagaae rahati thim
 This web series showed how Shalini Rizwan Chaudhary (huma Qureshi) lives a happy life with her husband and daughter Laila, but one day suddenly some unknown people enter her house and kill her husband
 or shalini ko uski beti ko uthaakar le jate hai
 In the same way, some people working with Virendra Dev used to find such women, who were upset in any way
 phir madad or aadhyatm ke naam par unhen ashram main laakar bandhak bana liya jaataa tha
 Those women were never able to go out
 deshbhar main dhong kii dukaan chalaane vaale virendra dev dikshit ne dilli ke rohinee ko apana thikaana banaaya
 He used to tell himself the need of 16108 gopis
 jab19 disambar ko aadhyatmik ishwariya vishvavidhyalay par police kii red padi to pataa chalaa ki wo ashram nahin puraa kila he
 On the order of Delhi High Court, when the team reached Rohini Ashram on the morning of 21 December, it took more than 9 hours to search the entire ashram

 The figures for the last years of sexual assault and rape of innocent children are shocking
 supreme court ne ise sangyaan (suo moto) main lete hue maamle main janhit yachika par sunwaayee shuru kii to aankadon kaa jinn saamne aayaa
 According to the data received from the states, the SC registrar filed a report on rape of children, from 2014 to 2017, around 33000 cases were registered under the Poxo Act across the country
 saal 2014 se 2018 ke bich in keson ke niptaare kii dar 24 fisadi rahi
 In the remaining 76 percent of the cases, the rate of pending cases has increased 15 times in the last five years to 1533 percent
 sabase zyada maamalon kaa nipataara karne vaale rajyon main mizoram 52%, madhya pradesh 36 % , sikkim 39 %, goa 31 % or assam 30 % hai
 The national average for settlement of Poxo cases was 24%
 keson ke niptaare main odisha 12 %, maharashtra 14 % or desh kii rajdhani dilli 15 fisadi ke saath neeche rahe
 At this pace it will take 6 more years to settle these pending cases
 tab tak aise mukademon kaa boj or aankada or bad jayega
 The number of judges in the country is also very low in proportion to Poxo cases
 yani aankadon ke aaine main yah anupaat 1: 224 he
 That is, the responsibility of hearing 224 cases of Poxo on a judge
 is maamle main sabase achche anupaat main chhattisgarh 1: 51, punjab 1: 51 or jharkhand 1: 82 hai
 The worst states are Kerala 1: 2211 (three courts in 14 districts), UP 1: 592, Maharashtra 1: 555, Telangana 1: 492 and Delhi 1: 383
 pokso act ke praavdhaan ke mutabik ek saal main trial puraa karne ke liye 1: 60 kaa anupaat chahie
 It is necessary to set up three times special courts to settle this burden of cases in a year
 peedit bacchon ko muaavja dene ke maamle main bhi adhiktar rajya sarkarein phiseddi hai
 According to the data received so far, 3% in 2015, 4% in 2016 and 5% in 2017 were compensated by Poxo cases i

 The Supreme Court asked the Delhi government why free metro service was being provided to women in Delhi
 saath hi yah bhi kaha ki yah DMRC ke liye ek laabhadaayak kadam nahin hoga
 The court advised the Delhi government that the government should use the tax money of the people properly
 justi arun mishra kii bench ne kaha ki dilli sarkaar ye sunishchit karne ke liye baadhya he ki metro ko nuksaan naa uthaanaa pade
 If the metro incurs losses, the Delhi government will have to bear
 bench ne kaha ki ek taraf aap muft main chije baant rahe hai to duusari ore supreme court se ghate kii baat karte hue centre sarkaar se rupee dilaane kii maang karte hai
 At the same time, Justice Deepak Gupta said that if you allow people to travel free, then this will be a problem

 rajasthanvidhansabha ne vipaksh ke netaa rameshwar dudi ke visheshadhikaar prastaav ko visheshadhikaar samiti ko saunp diya he
 Senior Congress leader Doody has moved the privilege motion against Parliamentary Affairs, Rural Development and Panchayat Minister Rajendra Rathore and ruling BJP Deputy Chief Whip Madan Rathore
 dudi ne aisa isliye kiya kyonki ve rathore dway se naaraaz the
 That is because these two leaders raised the issue of a video in the House, which shows that Doody is showing keen interest in the rate of speculative market
 isse yah chhavi bani ki dudi teen siton ke upachunaavon ke liye satta bazaar ke rate ke bare main jaankaree maang rahe hai or satta bazaar main unke bhi teen karod ru
 Are engaged yah video congress ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 Therefore, the BJP wants to keep this issue alive
 grih mantri gulab chand kataaria or rajendra rathore ne to yah chintaa jaahir kii ki kahin dudi apni hi party ke logon ke bhitaraghaat kaa shikaar to nahin hue, isliye unhone iske jaanch kaa prastaav rakh diya he
 Dudi, who was surrounded in the case, reminded Rathore and Home Minister Kataria that the two leaders had been involved in fake encounters
 gauratlab he ki rathore ko daara singh ke farji encounter maamle main or kataaria ko soharabuddin ke encounter maamle main bari kar diya gaya he
 The order of Rathore's acquittal was overturned by the Rajasthan High Court, but the Supreme Court stayed the order of the High Court
 maamla phir is maheene supreme court ke saamne pahunchaa tha, lekin ek jaj ne maamle se khud ko alag kar liya or ab ise duusari peeth ko saunp diya gaya
 The Sohrabuddin encounter case has also come under discussion
 haalanki dudi yaheen nahin rukate
 He says in a threatening manner that he will disclose the name of the BJP leader who has a hand in the encounter of Rajput mafia Anandpal Singh
 is encounter kii vajah se bhaajapa ko rajput voton kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Doody alleged that the video that went viral against him was cut and manipulated from a 45-minute video of him at a press conference and informal conversation with journalists
 unhone apane bachaav main kaha, ''main ek saadhaaran kisaan hum or is bare main kuch nahin jaanata ki satta bazaar main bhi paisa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 However, in a shocking move, they brought privilege offers against the two Rathore leaders
 ise vidhansabha ke spikar kailash meghavaal ne sweekaar bhi kar liya or maamle ko samiti ko saunp diya
 The ruling BJP is taken aback by this
 mantri rathore ne to ek tarah se dudi ko dhamkee hi de daali ki ve ise waapas le len, lekin dudi kii shikaayat par spikar ne rathore ko yah chetavanee di ki ve sanyam rakhen
 Rathore then placed the video recording in front of the House, which submitted it to the Privileges Committee
 unhone yah maang kii ki video kii forensik jaanch kara kar sachaai kaa pataa lagaaya jaae
 Doody's decision to pursue the privilege motion seems to indicate that he has no fear
 haalanki bhaajapa netaaon kaa kahana he ki ise visheshadhikaar samiti ko saunp kar dudi ne khud hi musiibat mol le lee he
 Public Works Department Minister Yunus Khan told India Today that the move would hurt Doody, as the video clearly shows that he is involved in betting
 philhal donon partiyaan gade murde ukhaadie main lagi hai
 Doody has made it clear that he will not miss making fake encounters a big issue
 bhaajapa ko ab yah sabit karnaa hoga ki dudi ne satta bazaar main paisa lagaaya he, jo shaayad aasaan nahin hoga
 Right now, this episode is going to get even more choppy, after all, the credibility of the leader of the strong opposition is at stake

 Sometimes the army is said to make faith a shield and such things are being said
 ham ye kaisaa bharat bana rahe hai jahaan vidhayak balki bijepi ke vidhayak kehete he ki main agar grahamantri hota to sena ke kilaaf bolne vaale intelexual ko goli se udwa detaa
 Do they not know that after retiring from the army, they have been questioning the army from general to brigadier and colonel
 ye kab se ho gaya ki aisa karne par goli se udwa diya jayega
 Basavan Gowda Patil is a BJP MLA
 karnataka ke vijaipura main kargil vijay diwas par bolte hue unhone kaha ki agar ve grahamantri hote to sena ke khilaaf bolne vaale ko goli se marava dete
 Think, what if he really would have been in place of Home Minister Rajnath Singh
 janaab vaajapeyi sarkaar main rajya mantri rah chuke hai
 You will see that by resorting to various arguments, an attempt is being made to justify murder, an attempt is being made to provoke
 kya aaj ke hindustan main intelexual se itani nafrat ho gai he ki goli se uda dene kii baat hogi
 Then the school college university should all be closed
 baswan gauda es patil ko pataa nahin hoga ki aaj hi 27 july ko supreme court main kya hua he
 Since 2016, 1528 cases of fake encounter are being heard by the security forces in Manipur

 The Supreme Court has reprimanded the Chief of CBI for laxity in its investigation
 unase kaha he ki 30 july ko bataaen ki tezi laane ke liye kya kiya ja saktaa he
 When the Supreme Court can order an investigation even after the opposition of the military and paramilitary forces, then Basavan Gowda is talking about shooting the public according to what understanding of the law
 kya ab is bhashaa main baat hogi
 In the alleged fake encounter case in Manipur, the Supreme Court has said that without any judicial process, the army or paramilitary forces are not allowed to kill anyone in the name of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act
 kisi ko shaq ke aadhaar par maar dene yaa rajya kaa dushman ghoshit kar dene se loktantr khatare main pad jayega
 Basavan Gowda has already given a statement that he does not ask for votes from Muslims, Hindus have full faith that votes will be obtained
 kya ye desh ko baantne vaala bayaan nahin he
 Such things are constantly getting comfortable in the public space
 sadak par bheed ko ishaara mil rahaa he ki unki hinsa kii karatuut ko raajnneetik samarthan hasil he
 Just kill someone and make an excuse for the army and faith
 jaise in do masalon ke liye kanoon he hi nahin
 Would you like to send your children to such a crowd who are ready to kill someone on any excuse
 27 july ko hi van rank van pension ko lekar sarkaar ne supreme court main kah diya ki vah apane formule kii dobaaraa samiksha nahin karegi
 Nothing that has been done cannot be done because it will increase financial pressure

 The organization of people who have retired from the army has approached the Supreme Court

 Was it necessary to give the center so far? bihar ke katihaar se ek parikshaarthi ne bataaya ki uskaa centre mohali padaa he
 From there one trains a day to Chandigarh
 agar pariksha se chaar din pehle chalegi to chaar din pehle nikalnaa hoga yaa phir train badal badal kar mohali pahunchnaa hoga, jiskaa kharchaa bad jayega
 One way fare from Katihar to Mohali is Rs 620
 vaapasi kaa tikat nahin mil rahaa he
 The cost of living there will be different
 railway kii timming kaa bharosa nahin isliye do teen din pehle nikalnaa hoga
 Why did the Railway Recruitment Board not calculate all these expenses and time? kya isliye kiya gaya he taaki badi sankhya main chaatr pahunch hi na saken or pariksha chhot jaae
 a student from Ara told that his center is Bhubaneswar
 use pehle haavda janaa hoga, vahaan se bhubaneshwar
 Return tickets also have to be taken

 The cost of commuting is 1500 only

 There is an outcry among the railway examinees
 rail mantri dhyaan nahin de sakate to pradhanmantri ko turant is baat kaa notice lenaa chahie
 Abhay Chaudhary has written that the Patna student center is lying in Jabalpur
 aane jane main hi 2000 rupee kharch ho jaaenge
 It is not spent, nobody is getting tickets

 Wow Minister! rail mantri or rail mantralay ko in chaatro kii baat par dhyaan dena chahie
 They are truly children of ordinary families
 kisi ke maa baap thela chalaate hai to kisi ke maa baap kalakatta main golgappa bechate hai
 Children of such families have to spend two to three thousand to go to Chennai from their district, go to Mohali, go to Hyderabad, a little more
 upi kaa sonbhadd behad garib ilaaka he
 If the center of the student here is in Mohali, then they will not be able to spend 1500 to 2000
 jab pariksha online ho rahi he tab phir idhar se udhar centre dene kaa kya matlab he
 Then what is the meaning of online
 kuch ladakon ne to likhaa he ki unke paas paise nahin he
 Either the Chief Minister of Bihar should give 2-2 thousand to all these students or they should also talk to the Railway Minister about why this is happening to poor students and how it can happen
 ek chaatr aara se hyderabad ja rahaa he use 3000 kaa kharch aa rahaa he
 Students are messaging a lot
 9 agast se pariksha shuru honi he
 If the Chief Minister of the States talks to the Railway Minister and waives the fare of these students, then i will not take credit for it at all
 balki main iskaa shrey unheen ko duungaa
 If you believe it was not a problem, then it would not be written
 bahut se chaatro kaa imtahaan chhot jayega

 udhar, 20 july se trakon kii hadtaal chal rahi he
 Due to this neither the goods are lifting nor reaching anywhere
 sosayadi of indian automobil ne kaha he ki hadtaal ke kaaran gadiyon kii supplai band ho gai he
 The All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) has called the strike
 inaki maang he ki dijal par tex kii kami kii jaae, petril or deazal ko jiesti ke daayre main laayaa jaae
 CPM and AIADMK have also told the government that a solution should be found by talking to the truckers
 kyonki hadtaal ke kaaran chizon ke daam bad sakate hai or kai chote mote vyapaaree jo rose ke aamad par nirbhar hote hai, unhen kaaphi nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Rather it is happening
 All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), kaa daawa he ki 93 lakh trek anischitkaaleen hadtaal par hai
 Truck operators are also opposing the illegal collection in the name of toll tax
 unka kahana he toll tex kam bhi kiya janaa chahie
 The strike was announced on 17 May itself
 inaki press relies ke anusaar hadtaal 70-80 fisadi safal he or isse udyogon ko 30,000 karod kaa ghaataa ho chukaa he
 Talks with the government many times but no result has come
 tippaniyan People associated with the truck strike are making a message that the strike has been going on for a week but no television media is showing it
 kisne dikhaaya kisne nahin dikhaaya is par daawey ke saath nahin kah saktaa magar aise massej viral karne waalon ko ek sawaal khud se poochna chahie
 What they watch on news channels
 hindu muslim dibet main mazaa aata he yaa 2018 ke july main 2019 kii may main koun jitegaa
 They are busy watching this discussion
 agar ve aise kaaryakramon ko dekhenge, badhaava denge to phir kaise ummid karte he ki jab ve hadtaal par jaaenge to channel par patrakarita hone lagegi
 They do not have a bus on what the channels show, but on this, they only have access to what they see on the channels at night or in the afternoon
 jo dekhte hai kya wo patrakarita he
 If the channeled journalists were doing journalism, then the public would not have been forced to raise their demand by being cocky
 in logon kaa kahana he ki food corporation of india unki pariksha lekar antim parinaam nahin nikaal rahaa he, jiske kaaran unki jwining ho sake
 The examination was held in December, the result came in March
 ye log rajasthan ke hai or gujarat rigen ke liye chune gaye hai
 Imtehan took place on this 11 February
 15 or 16 april ko shaareerik pariksha bhi ho gai, lekin april se july biit gaya magar final riselt nahin nikal rahaa he
 Also ask these youngsters whether they watch journalism on the channels or Hindu Muslim debates
 mere paas itani samasyaayein aa gayi hai ki din bhar manaa karne main nikal jaataa he kyonki main sabhi story kar hi nahin saktaa
 The job of the media is to bring the matter of the public to the government, but open any channel
 vahaan kya chal rahaa he
 By when will the public turn their hair and make cock for appearing in TV and appearing in newspaper

 Will it be spoken in this language now? manipur main kathith rup se phek encounter maamle main supreme court kah chukaa he ki bina kisi nyaayik prakriya ke sena yaa ardhsainik balon ko armd forces specianal power act ke naam par kisi kii hatya karne kii anumati nahin he
 Democracy will be put at risk by killing someone on suspicion or declaring an enemy of the state
 baswan gauda pehle bhi bayaan de chuke hai ki ve musalamaanon se vot nahin maangate hai, hinduon par puraa vishwaas he ki vot milegaa
 Is this not a statement dividing the country? aisi baaten lagaataar public spes main sahaj hoti ja rahi hai
 The crowd on the street is getting a hint that their violence has political support
 bas kisi ko maar kar sena or aasthaa kaa bahaanaa bana dena he
 Like there is no law for these two issues
 kya aap apane bacchon ko aisi bheed main bhejnaa chahenge jo kisi bhi bahaane kisi kii hatya ke liye taiyaar ho
 On July 27, the government said in the Supreme Court about the One Rank One Pension that it will not review its formula again

 They say that the One Rank One Pension Scheme implemented by the government is not according to the recommendations of the Koshiyari Committee

 vahaan se chandigarh ke liye hafte main ek din train jaati he
 If it will run four days before the exam, then you have to leave four days before or else you will have to change the train to reach Mohali, which will increase the cost katihaar se mohali kaa ek taraf kaa kiraaya 620 rupee he
 Return tickets are not available
 vahaan rahane kaa kharchaa alag hoga
 There is no confidence in the timing of the railways, so we have to leave two to three days in advance

 Has it been done so that large number of students cannot reach and miss the exam

 Sonbhad in UP is a very poor area

 When the exam is online, then what is the point of giving the center from here to there

 The comments trek hadtaal se jude log ek massej viral kar rahe hai ki ek saptaah se hadtaal chal rahi he magar koi tivi media nahin dikhaa rahaa he
 Who did not show, who did not show, can not say with claims, but those who viral such messages should ask themselves a question

 Who will win in Hindu Muslim Debate or in July of 2018 who will win in May of 2019

 What you see is journalism

 What is going on there kab tak janata tivi main aane ke liye or akhbaar main chhapane ke liye bal mudayegi or murga banegi
