 rashtriya janata dal ke purv saansad or jayeedhikaar party ke adhyaksh pappu yadav ne aarope lagaaya he ki bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa pichley kuch dinon se jo apmaan ho rahaa he, wo sab argedy adhyaksh lalu yadav kaa kiya-karaayaa he
 Not only this, he has also announced to bear the cost of challenging Shahabuddin's bail
 shahabuddin, raghuvansh, taslimuddin ke bayaan lalu ke kehane parbata den ki pappu yadav ne 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav argedy ke tikat par hi jeeta tha
 But he was later expelled from the party for anti-party activities
 pappu yadav ne kaha ki argedy se judeshhabuddin, raghuvansh prasad singh or taslimuddin baar baar apane bayanon se nitish kumaar kaa apmaan kar rahe hai
 By doing this, the post of Chief Minister is being downplayed
 pappu yadav ne aarope lagaaya ki ye netaa lalu ke kehane par hi nitish virdohi bayaan de rahe hai
 Pappu Yadav also criticized Nitish Kumar's statement in which he said that he got the mandate for the rule of Bihar and not for reacting to the statements of Shahabuddin
 pappu yadav ne kaha ki jab nitish ko pehali baar janadesh mila tha to wo lalu yadav ke khilaaf tha or bihar main kanoon kaa raaj kaayam karne ke liye tha
 Pappu Yadav alleged that the ruling party and opposition in Bihar were giving protection to criminals like Anant Singh, Surajbhan Singh, Dhumal Singh and Sunil Pandey
 pappu yadav ne kaha ki beete do saal main lalu yadav se haath milaane ke baad se nitish kii siem ke taur par chhavi ko bada nuksaan pahunchaa he, rajya main aparaadh bad gaye hai, saath hi apradhi bhi bekhauf ho gaye hai
 Announcing the cost of challenging Shahabuddin's bail, Pappu Yadav, speaking on the Rajiv Roshan murder case in which Shahabuddin was released from jail, said that he himself would bear the cost of challenging Shahabuddin's bail in the Supreme Court
 pappu yadav ke mutabik rajeev roshan ke pita chandrakeshwar prasad ko supreme court ke vakil prashanth bhushan kii madad lekar supreme court main shahabuddin kii jamaanat ko chunauti deni chahie

 In the 2014 elections, BJP won 73 seats in Uttar Pradesh by a record vote
 is baar bhi daawa 73 nahin balki 74 siton kaa he
 But the seat meets the equations, not the claims, and this time the SP-BSP alliance has messed up this equation of BJP
 yahi vajah se siem yogi adityanath ne ab dalit-yadav yani 'DY' formule ko todane main jute gaye hai
 That is why they are registering their income in the monastery of the Yadavas, sometimes on the doorway of the Dalit
 vivaadit bayaan ke baad chunaav ayog ke teen din ke pratibandh ke baad se hi siem yogi adityanath bhale hi sidhe chunaav prachaar na kar rahe hon par shahar-shahar mandir or mathon kaa daura kar sandesh jarur de rahe hai
 After that he reached Ayodhya in Lucknow where he tried to give a big message by eating food at the house of a Dalit after visiting the temple
 gauratlab he ki 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi bahut had tak daliton ke vot main send lagane main kaamyaab ho gai thi ise apane paale main barkaraar rakhane ke liye bijepi lagaataar kavayad bhi karti rahi
 Not only has he visited the temple of Lord Dalit Ravidas several times from PM to CM, but has also announced several plans for the development of this area by tasting an anchor here
 ab ek baar phir yogi daliton ke ghar bhojan kar unase nazadiiki badhaane kii apni muhim shuru kii he
 This strategy of BJP for Dalits is not new
 Election of 2014 was seen when the picture of top BJP leaders like this was seen in the food of Dalits
 is baar isaki shuruyaat soobe main yogi ne kii he
 This time there is an alliance of SP-BSP and hence BJP is looking to make a dent in the Yadav vote
 yahi vajah he ki pratibandh ke tisare din varanasi pahunche yogi ne apane daure kii shuruyaat bajrang bali ke darshan se to kii lekin iske baad yogi adityanath yadav samaaj ke sabase bade math gadhwaghat pahunche
 Let us tell you that this is the monastery in Varanasi where Yadav society has more faith, they see it as a descendant of Lord Krishna
 yahaan pahunchakar yogi ne gaay ko haraa chaara or gud khilaayaa or ashram ke mahant ke saath guftgu kii
 The Samajwadi Party has had a monopoly over the Yadavas within UP till now
 bijepi ko lagata he ki jis tarah se usne daliton ko apane saath joda tha, usee tarah yadavon ko bhi jod sakati he
 In the year 2014, BJP brought backward class with Dalits by bringing social engineering formula
 ab baari khaastaur se yadav samaaj kii he, jo bijepi se ab tak dur rahi he
 The BJP wants to break this myth and its hope rests on the Garhwaghat Ashram
 bijepi ko ye baat bakhubi maaloom he ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke tahat agar yadav puri tarah se golband ho gaye to kai siton par uskaa sameekaran gadabada saktaa he
 But the big question is whether the Yadav society will embrace the BJP, will this exercise of the chief of the state affect the SP BSP alliance in the state
 iskaa jawaab to chunaav baad hi pataa chal paayegaa philhal to bijepi apane har daanv ko khel rahi he

 com / l6w9zadplv — mayaa (@vijaymerajaan) December 11, 2019 agar radio tarangen bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) ke bheetar chal rahi taaja santhnik uthaa-patake kii khabar de paatin to april ke pehle hafte main chennai or kolkata ke bich danaadan baji phone kii ghantiyon se hi pataa chal jaataa
 Within a few hours, how many phones were knocked between the two cities
 phir agar ye tarangen phone par hui baatcheet ke tevar or andaaj ko pakad paatin to fouran us baari uthal-puthal kii bhi khabar de deteen ye koi maamuli haalchaal lene vaali baatcheet nahin thi
 Talks were spreading
 antarrashtriya cricket council (isisi) ke adhyaksh narayanswami shrinivasana samiti ke sadasyon ke chayan or june main bangladesh daure ko radd karne ke maamle main apni na chal paane se behad jhunjhala rahe the
 He also allegedly threatened to initiate the removal process of BCCI President Jagmohan Dalmiya for not accepting his views
 aakhirkaar kolkata se vitt mantri arun jetali ke paas ek naaraazgi bharaa phone pahunchaa, jo us vakt washington main the
 After this call, Srinivasan suddenly calmed down
 ab tak cricket kii duniya kaa yah nirvivaad badshaah dhul chatata najar aayaa
 The rise and fall of the 70-year-old Srinivasan in the cricket world will be remembered as the most interesting anecdote of the past decade
 yah vahi daur tha, jab bhadralok kaa yah gambhir khel twanti-20 ke paisa kamau sarkas main tabdeel ho gaya or isse itani kamai hui, jisaki kabhi kisi ne kalpana bhi nahin kii thi
 Yet Srinivasan's anecdote could fade the team's unique performance on the field and even Team India's World Cup triumph in 2011 at home
 shaayad yah kissa unke dost se dushman bane lalit modi kii ajeebogareeb daastaan ko bhi kam dilachasp bana de, jo pichley paanch saal se swa nirvaasan main landan main rah rahe hai
 ipl's birthright Modi had realized that he had grown up with the entire system
 aakhirkaar board ne unhen unki aukaat bataa di, jo kisi kaa kaidi banakar nahin rahata
 Like in 2005, Dalmiya and now Srinivasan were also told their status
 is tarah bisisiai vah chakra he, jo jitna detaa he, usase kahin zyada le letaa he
 Its wheel always rotates and cricket makes more of a coincidence than a ladder of power
 darasal isamen raajnneetikon, udyogpatiyon, lobbying karne waalon, pramotor, khilaadi se agent bane shaks or nami khilaadi se camentator bane tamaam tarah ke log iske agle ''rajaʼʼ ko chun lete hai
 2,286 crores from a non-profit organization in the last three decades, BCCI
 ke salanaa kaarobaar vaale corporate main badal gaya he
 Of course, the stakes are high here
 kaman paane kaa nasha kam nahin hota
 There is always someone else ready to take the throne and then he stays up to his slippery
 philhal to charchaa shrinivasana kii hi he
 His fault is that he annoyed the entire board and now there is a danger of losing the post of ICC President in front of him
 is pad par unhone pichhali garmiyon main tamaam vivaadon ke baavjood khud ko namjad kar liya tha
 "we all know that BCCI has nothing to do with cricket," says a former member familiar with bcci's internal system
 yah mahaj us par niyantran ke liye he
 However, with time, his bosses are becoming more sly
 jab daalamia pit gaye to ve chupchaap cricket association of bengal main dhyaan lagane lage or apane vakt kaa intjaar karne lage
 When Modi felt that his time as IPL chairman was over, he fled to England and harassed the board with his tweets and leaks
 ab shrinivasana har tarah kii tikadam lagaakar apane samrajya ko bachaae rakhane kii koshish main jute hue hai
 He has two big mistakes, in which he has given more attention to his interest in return for the common interests of BCCI
 supreme court ne nirdesh diya ki ve cricket ke prashaasak bane rah sakate hai yaa phir ipiel team ke maalik
 At this, he tried to seduce the BCCI through a ridiculous scheme
 4,000 karod ru
 Srinivasan, chairman and managing director of India's cement company, formed an associate company and gave it to Chennai Super Kings for just Rs 5 lakh
 main bech diya, jiskaa brands mulya american aprejal form ne 450 karod ru
 Is judged kathith taur par yah sab aise kiya gaya taaki har bikri par 5 fisadi rakam lene vaale bisisiai ko mahaj 25,000 ru
 meet
 board kii navgathit kaarysmiti ne is bikri par roak laga di he
 The last injury to Mr Niwasan probably occurred in the last week of April, when he sought to establish a relationship between the new BCCI secretary, BJP MP Anurag Thakur and a suspected bookie, allegedly abusing the ICC system
 haalanki is aarope ko abhi khaarij nahin kiya ja sakaa he, lekin thakur ne fouran javaabi hamalaa kiya
 He alleged that Srinivasan was spying some BCCI members from a London firm
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki unke isisi main bataur bisisiai pratinidhi hone kii samiksha kii ja rahi he
 In this way, Srinivasan has suddenly transformed from the cricket world emperor into a man with a sword hanging over his head
 unke patan kii kahani do samanaantar kisson ke saath shuru hoti he
 Two years ago, his son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan's name cropped up in the spot-fixing by the Mumbai Police, after which a Supreme Court inquiry committee headed by former High Court Judge Mukul Mudgal was constituted to investigate the functioning of the board
 is maamle ke aage badhate hi board main shrinivasana kaa rutaba ghatane laga
 Nevertheless, he retained his hold on the board despite all the fuss
 pehle to unhone yah kahkar bisisiai ke adhyaksh pad se istipha dene se inkaar kar diya ki unka yaa chennai super kings kaa mayppan se koi lenadena nahin he
 Then he created such an atmosphere that despite his withdrawal, he kept his grip and in 2014, he nominated himself for the ICC Chairman
 aakhir janvari, 2015 main supreme court ne mudgal report milane ke baad faisla sunaaya ki shrinivasana bisisiai kaa chunaav nahin lard sakate
 It was also said that they leave the ownership of IPL team and remove the matter of conflict of interest
 is maukey par bhi unhone daalamia ko bisisiai kaa adhyaksh banane main 'madadʼ kii
 Maybe in the hope that they will help them further
 agali kahani isi april main shuru hoti he
 Shortly after Srinivasan's hooting while handing the 2015 World Cup trophy to Australia at Melbourne's cricket ground
 do din baad isisi adhyaksh mustafa kamaal ne istife kaa elaan kar diya, jinhen bangladesh cricket board ne namjad kiya tha, kyonki isisi main shrinivasana kii manamaani chalati he
 He also said that the ICC has become practically the Indian Cricket Council
 unke is bayaan se buree tarah khize shrinivasana daalamia ko lagaataar phone karne lage ki ve june main tay bangladesh daure ko radd kar den, jisase bangladesh board ko baari vittiya nuksaan jhelana pade
 But Dalmiya refused to do so, saying that it would adversely affect diplomatic relations between the two countries
 kathith taur par shrinivasana is baat se aapa kho baithe or dhamkee di ki daura radd karo yaa bisisiai ke adhyaksh pad se fouran hataae jane kii karrwai jhelo
 Angry Dalmiya called Arun Jaitley and told him about this threat
 jetali centre main sabase taqatvar mantri hai or dilli cricket association main dabadabaa rakhte hai
 On the other hand, Srinivasan spoke to Sharad Pawar, former head of BCCI and ICC and Supremo of Nationalist Congress Party
 shrinivasana apni dushmani bhulaakar pavaar se dosti karnaa chaahate the taaki aage chalakar donon ke hit sadh saken
 Then it is said that Jaitley, who was supporting Srinivasan, took off his armor and left him alone
 ab daalamia-thakur kii lobby purv bisisiai pramukh shashaank manohar jaise sadasyon ke saath milakar apatkaaleen baithak bulaakar shrinivasana ko isisi ke chairman pad se tatkaal prabhaav se hataane kaa prastaav laane kii taiyaar kar rahi he
 Srinivasan is the BCCI representative in the ICC
 isliye unhen hataane ke liye do-tihaai yaa 21 voton kii darkaar hogi
 a senior member of the BCCI says, "you could not think of buying hostility from Srinivasan
" unhone puri vyavastha ko is kadar apane paksh main kar liya tha ki hameshaa jaruri sankhya unke saath hoti thi
 But no one is scared of them now
 unka maamla aayaa to samajhie ki ve isisi chairman pad se gaye
 कुछ Some of the issues related to BCCI members' displeasure with them are as follows
 ek, shrinivasana ke kaarykaal main kisi-na-kisi bahaane india cement yaa tamilnadu cricket association ke adhikari team india ke saath bane rahete the
 Two, seeing international loyalty in state associations determine international sports in their area
 teen, unke khilaaf mukademon kii pairvi main bisisiai ke lage 320 karod ru
 And fourth, the cases against Srinivasan gave the Supreme Court a peek into the bcci's activities
 shrinivasana ke liye ab aage kaa safar aasaan nahin he
 According to sources, dalmiya-thakur Toli has thought it better to wait until the General Assembly meets in September to oust Srinivasan from the ICC
 jo bhi ho, unke din gine-chune hi rah gaye hai
 It is said that the cat has nine lives
 lekin shrinivasana kii to shaayad das yaa gyaarah hai
 The truth is that now they are left alone
 bisisiai ke purv koshadhyaksh, sachiv or adhyaksh ko ab sabhi saathi akelaa chhodkar chale gaye hai
 People have reprimanded him on the international stage and the Supreme Court has turned his hammer on him
 isliye lagata he, shrinivasana ke paas ab koi jaan nahin bachi he
 Like his rise, cricket also has nothing to do with the fall
 vaise bhi bisisiai kaa cricket se kya lenadena

 Odisha Finance Minister Shashi Bhushan Behera attended the India Today Group's first State of State Odisha Conclave
 state of state odisha chapter kii shuruyaat karte hue india today samooh ke adeorial diarector raaj chengappa ne kaha ki india today magazine ne odisha kii aarthik sthiti kaa jayja lene ke liye manch par oriya sarkaar, industry leaders or krishi se lekar technology tak ke jaankaron ko manch par ekatra kiya
 During this session, the State Finance Minister explained how and where he has lagged behind Gujarat in the race for economic development
 is satr ke sawaal-jawaab satr ke dauraan raaj chengappa ne shashi behara ne kaha ki jiesti ko 1 july se lagu karnaa ek jaldbaaji main uthaaya gaya kadam tha
 The present Central Government showed haste in implementing it, although the preparation of the implementation of GST has been done by the Central and State Governments for the last 17 years
 behera ne jiesti main aa rahi dikkaton par kaha ki yah dikkatein mahaj tranjishan ke dauraan dekhne ko milegi
 The GST Council is meeting every month and an exercise is being made to resolve the problems faced by the states
 behera ne kaha ki jiesti puri duniya main charchit model he
 Around 166 countries have imposed GST with one tax slab
 haalanki hamaare desh main 5 tex slab vaala jiesti lagu kiya gaya he
 Raj Chengappa asked what the impact of the demonetisation was seen in Odisha
 behera ne bataaya ki notebandi mahaj ek paper war tha
 There was a very small amount of cash left that did not return to the economy
 lihaaja sawaal he ki aakhir blikemani kahaan he?ise bhi padhein: SOS Conclave Odisha: ye he vikaas kaa 'odisha model'behera ne kaha ki odisha main 50 fisadi gaanv aaj bhi banking network se baahar he
 So, after demonetisation in the state, you can guess how much people in rural areas have suffered in taking new currency in exchange for old currency
 rajd ne behera se poocha ki kya kendra kii modi sarkaar ne beete teen saal ke dauraan unke rajya ke saath nyaay kiya he
 Behera said that the state has not got justice from the center in all areas like railways, natural calamity from the center
 satr ke dauraan behera se poocha gaya ki notebandi ke dauraan odisha or bihar kii sarkaron ne swaagat kiya tha
 Naveen Patnaik also welcomed it
 lekin ab rajya sarkaar kah rahi he ki notebandi se nuksaan pahunchaa
 Behera said that demonetisation as a policy was a right step but it was not implemented properly
 behera se ajit jha ne poocha ki desh ke nakshe main ek chor par gujarat he or duusare chor par odisha he
 But why is Odisha so backward compared to Gujarat? Behera said that from 17-18 years in Odisha, the government has tried to change the course of development
 is dauraan industry or agriculture ke kshetra main odisha ne bada kaam kiya he
 But the state is backward in setting up the factory where Gujarat has benefited more
 is antar ko khatm karne ke liye hamen kendra sarkaar or videshon se bade lone kii aavashyaktaa he jisase odisha bhi gujarat kii tarah chamak sake

 vihip ne kaha ki CIA dwaara vishwa hindu parishad va bajrangdal ko ugravadi (militant) dharmik sanghathan ghoshit karnaa ghor aapattijanak, apmanjanak tathaa tathyon se pare he

 These organizations never compromise with the interests of the country and Hindu interests

 Despite this, it is only possible due to any vested interest to make this unrestrained accusation

 With what authority can the CIA, which stands in the fire of jihadist terrorist by raising Osama bin Laden, comment on the country's devout organization? vihip ke sanyukt mahasachiv ke yah bhi kaha ki CIA kii bharat virdohi maansikta uski kathith Factbook main chape bharat ke maanchitr se bhi spasht ho jaati he

 ' Ayodhya, which is the birthplace of Lord Rama in Hindu beliefs, but during the Mughal period, this city became famous because of the Babri Masjid
 ye itihaas paanch sau saal purana he
 But in the 19th century, the claim about its existence changed, it also caused earthquake in the politics of the country along with the city
 vivaad kii sugabugahat us nagar main sunai dene lagi, jo sarayu nadi ke kinare behad shant najar aati thi
 Ayodhya is such a city in itself, whose health has never appealed to outsiders
 apni buniyaad ke saath hi is nagar ne kisi ke aage ghutane tekna nahin siikhaa
 This is the reason
 
 
 ki ayodhya nagari ko jeeta nahin ja sakaa he
 Imam Hind is Lord Ramayodhya's past speaks like this
 uske jharokhon se ganga-jamuni tahjeeb kii aisi nazeer jhaankati he, jiskaa gumaan ikbaal jaise shaayar bhi bayaan kar gaye
 On the existence of Rama, Hindustan is considered a Nazi, ahle-look, and call him imam-hind
 allamaa ikbaal jaise shaayar ram ko hind kaa imam bataa gaye
 This is before independence
 us daur main bhi mandir or masjid kaa vajood apni jagah ko lekar ulajh chukaa tha
 But that example of the poet Iqbal tells the atmosphere of Ayodhya something else
 hindu-muslim donon karte saath-saath puja or ibaadtaus daur kaa maahaul aaj jaisaa ugr nahin tha, angrejon kii banaai vyavastha ke mutabik hindu or muslim donon samudaayon ke liye puja paath kii alag-alag jagah tay thi
 Both Ajan and Rama's cheer echoed at his time
 isamen shariq donon samudaay ke log hote the
 Ramlala clothes were stitched, erected in Muslim homes, and the days of Ramadan also opened in the presence of Hindu Mahants
 ye misaal or parampara to aaj bhi kaayam he, jabaki siyasatdanon ne samaaj main jehar gholne kii har sambhav koshish kii he, lekin unke majboot iraadon ko hilaa nahin sake
 In Ayodhya, there is a shared example of a shared legacy of Muslim artisans like Babu Bhai and Mahant Gyandas Ji of Hanuman Garhi
 babu bhai aaj bhi ramalala ke kapade silate hai, to vahiin mahant gyaandas unke ghar aksar hanuman chalisa sunaane jate hai
 How did ram-rahim's shared legacy spread? How did the distinction between Namaz and Ramnami grow as the country became independent? That common group anthem of religious faith was being heard in Ayodhya for centuries in the midst of the streak of the temple and the mosque, but as the country became independent, it turned into a monologue of religion
 wo saal tha 1949
 The miracle effect in Ayodhya had been two years since independence
 desh ke bantwaare ke saath jo sampradayik sauhaard bigadaa, apane-apane dharm ko lekar vichaaron main kattarta ai
 This was the same period when Mahatma Gandhi was killed
 hindu mahasabha jaise sanghathanon kaa paracham laharaaya
 And a miracle also happened in Ayodhya that year of 1949
 aisa us daur ke sadhu santon ne daawa kiya
 The idol of Ramlala appeared inside the Babri Masjid on that cold night of 22 December
 magar sach kuch or tha
 The following day, the FIR lodged by the Ayodhya Police named Sant Abhiramdas, Ramshakal Das and Sudarshan Das
 aarope laga ye teen log apane 50-60 samarthakon ke saath aadhi raat ko vivaadit parisar main ghuse or bhagwaan ram kii murti rakh di
 According to the police, the entire exercise was done to spoil the religious atmosphere, desecrate the shrine

 On Sunday, Sasikala met mlas who had been staying for the last two days at a resort outside Chennai
 resort jane se pehle shashikala ne divangat netaa jayalalita ke pos garden sthit awaas par patrakaron se kaha ki mahila ke liye raajnneeti main rahanaa bahut mushkil he
 Sasikala also showed a copy of a 'fake letter' sent to Governor c Vidyasagar Rao in his name, in which he allegedly threatened suicide if he did not form the government
 annadramuk pramukh ne kaha, 'mere naam kaa ek farji patr soshal media main chal rahaa he, ek mitra ne mujhe isaki soochna di
 The media should also see, it is very difficult for a woman to be in politics
 purachi talavai ke samay main bhi aisi hi dekha gaya tha, lekin vah isse ladakar aage badhin'
 Sasikala said that she had witnessed such nervousness in the AIADMK after the death of party founder late MG Ramachandran, but Jayalalithaa ran the party in a manner and ensured that the party would win power for the second time
 somvaar ko faisla aane kii ummid nahinshashikala ke liye mushkilen itani hi nahin hai
 The Supreme Court's decision in the disproportionate assets case against him is not expected to come on Monday

 The absence of Sasikala in the cause list means that no decision is expected on Monday
 aise main duusari ore ye bhi khabar he ki shashikala gut jarurat padane par siem candidet badalane par bhi vichaar kar rahaa he
 On Saturday, Sasikala, the General Secretary of AIADMK, met her supporter mlas at the resort before the meeting with legislators
 unhone raat main kaha ki rajyapal dwaara unhen sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit karne main vilamb aisa prathit hota he ki hamaari party main tut ko sugam banane ke liye he
 Sasikala said in a letter to the Governor on Saturday that she had made a detailed presentation on Thursday to invite him to form the government as i have an absolute majority

 Different voices are heard in the Aam Aadmi Party about who will be the chief ministerial candidate in Punjab
 ek or party kii dilli main baithi haikaman saaf kar chuki he ki party chunaav main arvind kejariwal kaa cheharaa lekar jaaegi or nattejey aane ke baad agar punjab main party sarkaar banane kii sthiti main ai to phir party ke jite vidhayak senior leadership ke saath baithkar apana netaa chunenge
 But now after the Manifesto controversy, the leaders of Aam Aadmi Party of Punjab are saying different things
 aam aadmi party ke punjab se saansad bhagwant maan ne kaha ki party vidhansabha chunaav main jane se pehle hi saaf kar degi ki party main koun mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa hoga or saath hi ye bhi spasht kar diya he ki siem candidet punjab se hi hoga
 He said that the leadership of the party in Punjab is so capable that only one of them can be made the chief minister
 bhagwant maan nekejarivalki patni sunita kejariwal ke viares se uth rahi in khabaron ko bhi nakaar diya, jinamein ye kayaas lagaae ja rahe he ki wo punjab main siem phase ho sakati hai
 'the dictator is Kejriwal', while the Congress and the Akali Dal, while quipping on this, said that by asking Bhagwant Mann, the party did not even make its manifesto, how can he comment on who will be the CM today
 kejariwal ek dictator hai, jinke anusaar hi aam aadmi party chalati he, aise main siem bhi kejariwal kii marji se hi hoga
 The decision of the leaders of Punjab, according to the wishes of Bhagwant Mann, is being interpreted that after his neglect during the manifesto release, now the leaders of Punjab Aam Aadmi Party want that no decision on the issues of Punjab should be taken without asking them And on every issue in Punjab, the party should put forward the leaders of Punjab itself

 US $ 5 billion in aid appears to be implicated in the crisis

 The US Parliament vehemently approved the five-year aid plan in 2009
 donon deshon kaa kahana tha ki yah package unke aapasi rishton ko ek nai disha dene main sahaayak hoga
 But even after two years, only $ 500 million has been spent
 adhikariyon ke bich is baat ko lekar vivaad he ki is raashi ko kahaan kharch kiya jaae
 Along with this, due to the fear of corruption, this amount has not been spent

 In the news of currency crisis in many states of the country, Reserve Bank of India has admitted that in some states this crisis is being seen due to lack of cash
 isse nipatane ke liye rigerv bank ne antarraji samiti kaa gathan kiya he jo agle teen din main anya rajyon se cash sankat vaale rajyon main cash pahunchane kaa kaam karegi
 However, on the contrary of the rbi's argument, the Reserve Bank Officer Confederation has claimed that there is a shortage of 30 to 40 per cent of the cash in the country and this shortfall is due to the pressure of continuous digital economy by the Reserve Bank
 adhikariyon ke is sanghathan ne daawa kiya he ki deshbhar main logon main kendra sarkaar dwaara prastaavit echardiai bill kaa khauf he, lihaaja log bank main paisa jamaa karne kii jagah cash apane paas rakhane ko tarjeeh de rahe hai
 According to this organization, the Reserve Bank of India is rationing cash to create a digital economy, which is causing a cash crisis in many states
 cirkulation main 30 se 40 fisadi karency kii kami 2000 rupee or 500 rupee kii karency cirkulation se baahar jane ke chalate paidaa hui he
 This is evident from the fact that people across the country are experiencing fear of possible changes in the banking system and people are preferring to keep more and more money at home in big currency
 ise padhein: jetali kaa daawa- desh main nahin he cash sankat, kuch jagah achaanak maang badhane se dikkatakya he echardiai bilaprastaavit echardiai bill ke jariye kendra sarkaar sabhi vittiya sansthaaon jaise bank, insurance company or anya vittiya sanghathanon kaa insolvency or bankerpsi code ke tahat uchit niraakaran karnaa chaah rahi he
 By making this bill a law, the central government will try to bail out the sick financial companies from the crisis
 is bill kii jarurat 2008 ke vittiya sankat ke baad mahasoos kii gai jab kai hai-profile bankerpsi dekhne ko mili thi
 Since then, the Central Government has made continuous efforts with decisions like Jan Dhan Yojana and Demonetisation that more and more people should remain under the banking system
 iske chalate yah behad jaruri ho jaataa he ki banking vyavastha main shaamil ho chuke logon ko bank yaa vittiya sanstha ke doobane kii sthiti main apane paison kii suraksha kii guarantee rahe
 The major provision of the FRDI bill is the provision of a resolution corporation in this bill which will be replaced by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation
 yah rejolution corporation vittiya sansthaaon ke swasthya kii nigaraanee karegaa or unke doobane kii sthiti main use bachaane kaa prayaas karegaa
 At the same time, when the financial institution is set to sink, in such a situation it will solve their financial liability
 gauratlab he ki rejolution corporation kaa ek ahm kaam graahakon ko diposit insurance dene kaa bhi he haalanki abhi is insurance kii seemaa nirdhaarit nahin kii gai he
 Why is it afraid of the FRDI bill? Through the FRDI bill, the resolution corporation also has the right to take (bail in) steps to rescue the failing entity
 jahaan bel out ke jariye sarkaar janata ke paise ko sust padi arthvyavastha main nivesh karti he jisase use ubaara ja sake vahiin bel in ke jariye bank graahakon ke paise se sankat main pade bank ko ubaarane kaa kaam kiya jaataa he
 Due to this provision of the FRDI bill, common people fear that if their bank fails, they may have to lose their hard earned money
 gauratlab he ki maujuuda praavdhaan ke mutabik kisi bank ke doobane kii sthiti main graahak ko uske khate main jamaa kul rakam main mahaj 1 lakh rupee kii guarantee rahati he or baaki paisa lautaane ke liye bank baadhya nahin rahete
 The government has not yet taken any decision on this amount of guarantee in the proposed FRDI bill
 gauratlab he ki congress ke netritv main 7 vipakshi dalon ne 'kadachaar' ke aaropon ko lekar mukhya nyaayadhish par mahabhiyog chalaane ke liye uparashtrapati or rajyasabha ke sabhapati em venkaiya naidu ke paas notice bheja tha, jise unhone paryaapt aadhaar naa hone kii baat kahkar naamanzoor kar diya tha

 Amarinder Singh also said that as far as the alliance at the national level is concerned, it is the job of the party high command to take this decision
 mukhyamantri ne saaf kiya ki congress ko punjab main kisi gathbandhan kii jarurat nahin he
 The chief minister said that he had consulted his cabinet ministers on the issue of alliance after the Punjab cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning
 amarinder singh ke mutabik sabhi is baat par ekamat the ki congress ko rajya main kisi or party ke saath gathbandhan kii jarurat nahin or wo khud hi rajya main loksabhaa chunaav jeetne main sakasham he
 On the question of legalizing the production of narcotics which gives rise to drugs in Punjab, the Chief Minister said that he was not in favor of it nor would he ever allow drugs to ruin the state
 amarinder singh ne kaha ki aam aadmi party ke saansad yaa anya kuch bhi kehete rahen lekin wo punjab main nashile padaarthon kii paidaavaar nahin hone denge
 On a question related to Chandigarh, Amarinder Singh said that his government will not allow the interests of Punjab in the Union Territory to be weakened at any cost

" bharat us din sarender karne adaalat pahunch bhi gaya lekin behad aashcharya kii baat yah ki vahaan koi pulicekarmi hi maujuud nahin tha jo use hiraasat main letaa

 Bharat Vyapam is accused in four cases of appointment scam

 According to the FIR, he had paid crores of rupees from junior doctors to pass the pre-pg medical test in 2012

 He was also wanted in the police constable, sub-inspector and food inspector recruitment scam

 Sudhir Sharma, a school teacher turned mine mafia and Amit Pandey, husband of Additional Principal Secretary (planning) Ajita Bajpai Pandey, is still out of the reach of STF

 Most of the firs in the scam have been registered on the basis of information received from the hard disk of Nitin Mahindra, the former Chief Analyst of Vyapam
 mahindra ko 16 july, 2013 ko giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 From his hard disk, stf's hand bribes, recommendations and important information related to the scam were found
 isi main madhya pradesh ke purv takneekee shiksha mantri lakshmikant sharma kaa naam bhi tha
 But the STF waited till the assembly elections to register an FIR against them

 isamen bataaya gaya he ki uma ne lakshmikant sharma se sanvida shikshakon kii bhartee main kuch logon kii sifarish kii thi
 However, the Chauhan government is making every effort to show that its attitude towards scamsters is very strict

 In this Mahaghotale, STF has accused more than 1,300 people
 inamen se giraftaar 500 logon main zyaadaatar chaatr or unke abhibhavak hi hai
 STF has so far avoided putting hands on big fish

 The RJD today accused Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of misrepresentation in the case of ignoring the interests of Bihar in the 1996 Ganga water sharing treaty between India and Bangladesh
 nitish kumaar ke janata darbar main hua nagin dancerajd saansad jagadanand singh ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘ganga jal bantwaaraa sandhi ke sambandh main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar galatabayani kar rahe hai
 In 1996, the then Bihar government protested both before and after the treaty
 ’ ullekhneey he ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha tha ki 1996 main centre kii tatkaaleen sanyukt morcha sarkaar ne bangladesh ke saath jo ganga jal bantwaare kii sandhi kii thi, usase bihar ke hiton kaa nuksaan hua he or soobe kii tatkaaleen sarkaar (lalu sarkaar) ne iskaa virodh nahin kiya tha
 Read how Nitish Kumar's dream was fulfilled, while reversing this topic, Bihar's Water Resources Minister in 1996, Singh said that Nitish Kumar is making a very wrong statement
 bihar sarkaar ne sandhi ke bare main virodh darj karaayaa tha or yah dastavej main darj he
 Nitish Kumar should see the document
 bihar kii badalati tasviren dekhenjagadanand singh ne kaha ki bihar sarkaar ganga ke basin kshetra ko lekar sandhi se pehle se hi chintit he
 Bihar formed the Second Irrigation Commission in 1991 and its report came in 1994

 Traveling from Engineer Nitish to Vikas Purush Nitish, the senior leader of Rajad said that it was due to the opposition of the Government of Bihar that the Government of India promised that the interests of Bihar would not be allowed to be harmed due to the Ganga water sharing treaty
 bharat sarkaar ko patr likhane ke baad kendriya jal ayog, ganga barh niyantran ayog or kendriya jal sansaadhan ayog ne baithak kii or aashwaasan diya ki rajya ke hiton kii andekhi nahin hogi
 He accused the Nitish government of stagnation and said that the government was not able to put its point properly before the Center

 Satyendra Jain is clearly making a statement after the support of Arvind Kejriwal, but giving a clean chit to the incoming minister could be a problem for the government, as the sword of income tax department questions is still hanging on Satyendra Jain

 rajdhani dilli main bhale hi kejariwal sarkaar or centre sarkaar ke bich jabardast khinchataan ho lekin modi sarkaar dilli ke vidhayakon ko badi khushkhabari de sakati he
 If sources are to be believed, the central government has agreed to increase the salary of mlas
 darasal, kejariwal sarkaar ke satta main aane ke baad aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon ne apni tankhwaah badhaane kii maang rahi he
 Aam Aadmi Party mlas say that the salary of mlas in Delhi is very less
 jisko lekar 2015 main mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi kii sarkaar ne vidhansabha main vidhayakon ke vetanvruddhi kaa vidheyak pesh kiya tha, jo vidhansabha se paas bhi ho gaya tha
 As soon as the bill was passed, the salary of mlas was to increase by 400 per cent, but due to lack of approval of the Center, the wait became longer
 iske mutabik dilli vidhayakon kii basic selary jo pehle 12 hajaar rupee thi use badhaakar 50 hajaar rupee kar diya gaya tha
 With this, allowances and pensions were also increased
 lekin farvari 2017 main dilli ke vidhayakon kii selary main badhotaree ke kejariwal sarkaar ke prastaav par centre sarkaar ne brake laga diya tha or grih mantralay ne bill waapas lautaane kaa saath is mudde par dilli sarkaar se or jaankaree maangi thi
 Then in April 2018, the issue was again raised in Delhi Assembly by Aam Aadmi Party MLA Special Ravi and said that the salary of mlas is 12 thousand, while the salary is 2 to 2
 5 lakh honi chahie
 He also said that due to low salary, mlas are not getting married
 selary itani kam he ki ghar chalaanaa mumkin nahin he
 Married legislators have children, expenses are increasing
 vahiin jin vidhayakon kii shaadi nahin hui unke liye rishte nahin aa rahe hai
 Opposition colleagues should also keep an opinion on this and tell when will they go to the Home Minister
 uske baad dilli ke up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne dilli vidhansabha ne ek prastaav rakhaa jiske tahat is mudde par ek 6 sadasyeey cameti banaai gai
 Whose job it was to talk to the central government on this issue
 is cameti main dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ke alaava 3 'aap' vidhayak saurav, sanjeev, praveen or baaki 2 bijepi vidhayak sirsa, opi sharma cameti main shaamil kiya gaya
 At the same time, BJP MLA Om Prakash Sharma in the House supported this proposal and said, 'we are with this proposal
 mukhyamantri ko is par sakaaratmak kaary karnaa chahie
 Due to low salary of mlas, marriage is not happening
 vetan badhanaa chahie jisase shaadi ho
 According to sources, this committee had made its point from Home Minister to Finance Minister
 sutron kii maane to kendriya grih mantralay ne prastaav ko paas karke vit mantralay ko bhej diya he
 Sources said that now soon the Modi government can give good news to the mlas of Delhi
 ministry of lebar ke matternity benefit act 1961 ke tahat har offis main, jahaan 30 se zyada mahila karmchaaree hai, vahaan cretch kii suvidha anivaary he
 This facility is found in some companies, but in most of the private companies, this feature is missing
 aise main ek varking women ke liye apane bachche or offis donon dayitvon ko saath lekar chalanaa mushkil hota he
 Therefore, the Government of Karnataka has taken a unique initiative in this direction
 karnataka sarkaar ne notification jari kar rajya main sthit sabhi nijee companiyon ko kaha he ki wo company main kaam karne vaali sabhi mahila karmchaariyon ko cretch ke liye bhugtan karen
 It has been made mandatory for all state-based companies
 cretch main 10 maheene kii bacchee sang aayaa ki darindagi dekh dahal uthegaa dilrajya sarkaar ne nijee companiyon main contract par kaam karne vaali mahilaon se sambandhit 15 nirdesh jari kiye hai, jisamen cretch ke liye bhugtan bhi shaamil he
 Apart from this, companies will also have to provide pick and drop facilities to women employees
 saath hi yah bhi sunishchit karnaa hoga ki mahilaon kii dropping aakhir main na ho

 He said that Modi's wave gained a lot during the campaign in UP
 iske alaava unhone kaha ki endie purna bahumat se sarkaar banaaegi or agar koi party samarthan dena chaahati he to uskaa swaagat hoga
 Challenges faced in UP campaign 
 
 narendra modi ke kareebi amit shah ne kaha ki upi main ham 17 saal se satta se baahar hai, sanghathanaatmak dhaancha bhi charmaraya hua tha
 On the other hand, if we see the positive side, Modi's wave in the whole country got the benefit here

 Many youths are associated with BJP

 'azamgarh main mere bayaan ko galat tareeke se liya gaya
 
 
 When Amit Shah was asked about his controversial statement in Azamgarh, he said, 'I did not say anything wrong

 shah se jab poocha gaya ki unka or vivaadon kaa cholii-daaman kaa saath kyon rahata he to unka jawaab kuch yun tha, 'shaayad meri grah dasha aisi hogi
 In my view, one of the reasons for being in dispute is that i keep my opinion in mind
 apni raay dene main sankoch nahin karata hum
 'article 370 has nothing to do with communalism
 
 
 amit shah ne kaha, 'artical 370 ko sampradayikta se jod kar dekhnaa galat he
 Article 370 has nothing to do with communalism
 party ke ghoshnaa patr main jo kuch bhi likhaa he party us par kaam karegi
 The issues of the party which have been going on for years, are written in the manifesto
 'modi ke prati janata main snebomit shah ne kaha, 'hamaara kisi se darane kaa to sawaal hi nahin he
 When Modi reached Varanasi to file his nomination, people followed his convoy
 hamane kisi ko nahin bulaayaa tha
 The public is with the same leader with whom he has affection and acceptance
 'votaron kaa koi dharm nahin hota
 
 
 When Amit Shah was asked whether there is fear of the party among the minorities of UP, he said, 'if there is fear, we will remove this fear
 bhay rakhane kaa koi kaaran nahin he
 i and my party do not aim to divide the voters into hindu-muslim
 hamaare khilaaf dushprachaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The country's voters have no religion
 'modi kii sarkaar main nahin hoga kisi ke saath anyaagamit shah ne kaha, 'modi kii sarkaar main kisi bhi naagarik ke saath anyaay nahin hoga
 We do not want to be communal

 'kejariwal par saadhaa nishaanaa

 chunaav ke baad unka intervyuu jarur lijiega
 When Amit Shah was asked which seat Modi would choose in Vadodara or Varanasi, he said, "I appeal to the people of Varanasi to win Modi ji with such huge votes that this dispute will be over
 Which seat will you choose
 varanasi main is baar matganana nahin balki janaganana hogi
 'the party will decide on me

 The leaders informed Priyanka about the Chinmayanand case of Shahjahanpur
 congress ne lallu ko nayaa adhyaksh banaaya he, lekin shuukravaar ko unke shapath grahan samaaroh se kai varisht netaa nadaarad rahe

 congress ke liye sabase badi chunauti asantosh rokane ko lekar he
 The dissatisfaction is that leaders who joined the party just before the Lok Sabha elections have been given organizational responsibilities

 Today is considered a big day in the politics of Uttar Pradesh
 23 saal kii dushmani bhulaakar 25 saal pehle ke tarj par sapa-basapa ek saath chunavi abhiyaan kii shuruyaat pashchimi uttar pradesh ke devband se karne ja rahe hai
 SP President Akhilesh Yadav, BSP chief Mayawati and RLD Chief Chaudhary Ajit Singh will conduct political equations by addressing the public from a platform
 bijepi ke khilaaf in teenon netaaon ke ek manch par aane ke peeche sirf raily hi nahin balki siyaasi myne bhi chhipe hue hai
 In the state, whenever the SP-BSP has joined hands, then the BJP has had to be defeated
 90 ke dashak main ram mandir andolan kaa daur tha, lekin mulaayam-kanshiram ne 1993 ke vidhansabha chunaav main gathbandhan kar maidan ne utre to bijepi kaa puri safaya ho gaya
 In the same way, in the bypolls of UP in 2018, the SP had dashed the BJP with the support of the BSP
 lekin is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main gathbandhan ko apane itihaas dohraane kii badi chunauti he
 In such a situation, this rally in Deoband will determine the mood of the electoral battlefield
 pashchim uttar pradesh kii pehle charan kii 8 loksabhaa siton ke liye 11 april ko matdaan honge
 Saharanpur, Kairana, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Bijnor, Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar seats
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main in aathon siton ko bijepi ne jeeta tha
 But in the by-election held in Kairana seat last year, the BJP was defeated and the RLD managed to win with the support of the BSP-SP
 basapa ke sansthaapak kanshiram ke saath mulaayam singh yadavapaschim upi ek daur main basapa or areldi kaa majboot garh mana jaataa tha, lekin 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne in donon partiyon kii siyaasi jameen ko kabja jamaane main kaamyaab rahi thi
 This is the reason that the BJP is struggling to maintain its supremacy
 vahiin, basapa, areldi or sapa gathbandhan ke liye apni khoi hui jameen paane kii chunauti he
 In view of this, every political party is putting full power to take the lead from the first phase itself
 pashchim upi main bijepi ne ek ke baad ek kai reliyaan kar daali hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has addressed public meetings in Meerut and Saharanpur for these eight seats
 jabaki gathbandhan kii pehali raily ravivaar ko saharanpur main rahi he, jisamen akhilesh, mayawati or ajit singh teenon netaa kisi manch par ek honge
 Ethnic Equations of Western UP These three leaders are also eyeing caste equations in eight UP Lok Sabha seats
 isi khaas ranneeti ke tahat gathbandhan ne devband kshetra se chunavi reliyon kaa aagaaj karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Through this rally, the coalition effort is believed to strengthen the alliance of Jat, Muslim and Scheduled Castes in Western UP
 pashchim upi main dalit, muslim or jat matadaata hi nirnayak bhoomika main he
 That is why the three leaders have come together to solve the equation
 dalit matadaataaon ko saadhane kii jahaan mayawati koshish karengi
 At the same time, Muslim voters will exercise Akhilesh Yadav and Jat community Chaudhary Ajit Singh
 dilachasp baat ye he ki basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne rajyasabha sadsyta se jis kaaran istipha diya tha, uske link bhi isi saharanpur se judata he
 In such a situation where Mayawati will try to convey this message to her community, she is the only leader to raise her voice
 saharanpur seat se mayawati khud bhi pratinidhitiv kar chuki hai, aise main is seat ko harhaal main jeetne kii unki koshish he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath have attacked RLD President Chaudhary Ajit Singh and Jayant Chaudhary during their public meetings in West UP, which can be reversed from the political rally of the alliance in Deoband
 itnaa hi pashchim upi kisaan belt vaala ilaaka he, aise main aise main choudhary ajit singh kisaanon ke mudde ko uthaakar bijepi ko gher sakate hai
 Apart from this, for RLD, this election is a do or die situation
 pita-putr donon kii kismat kaa faisla pehle charan main he
 In such a situation, they have the challenge to prove themselves in every denial
 vahiin, pehle charan ke liye gathbandhan ke teenon netaaon kii yahi eklauti raily he
 In such a situation, the three leaders come together and try to give a big message to their workers and voters that they are one and you too should become one
 saharanpur main ek prayog safal rahata he to gathbandhan ke liye aage kii raah kaaphi aasaan ho jaaegi
 The coalition will try to cash in on the atmosphere created by the first phase in the rest of the state

 It is politics that we need to improve film kaa naam: shaadi main jarur anadyrector: ratna sinhaster cast: rajkumaar raav, kriti kharbanda, govind namdev, manoj paahvivadhi: 2 ghanta 17 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 2
 For 2017 Starrajkumar Rao, the year 2017 was very good, 'trapped', 'bahn Hogi Teri', 'bareilly Ki Barfi' and the nominated 'newton' for the Oscars were also released this year
 har film main apni alag chhap chhodane vaale powerpake hero rajkumaar raav phir se 'shaadi main jarur aana' film ke saath bade parde par hajir hai
 The story begins with Satyendra alias Sattu (rajkumar Rao) and Aarti (kriti Kharbanda) from the Orange Marriage, but the twist in the story comes when Aarti leaves the house on the wedding night
 shaadi se pehle apane kariyar ke upar dhyaan dene kaa nirnay karti he
 After 5 years Sattu becomes an IAS officer and Aarti also starts working as a PCS officer
 ek baar phir se sattu or aarti kaa aamanaa-saamana hota he lekin is baar sattu ko aarti se bahut zyada nafrat hoti he kyonki shaadi kii raat jab aarti ghar chhodkar bhaagi thi to uski vajah se sattu ke puure khandaan kii bejjati hoti he
 By the way, what happens eventually, you will only know by watching the film

 - rajkumaar raav ne film main do alag tarah ke kirdaaron ko bakhubi nibhaayaa he, ek jo pyaar karne vaala aashiq hota he or doosraa jo behad nafrat karata he
 Along with this, the character of Kriti Kharbanda is also a compliment

 That's why the film's team wants 'bahubali' star Prabhas to play the role of Ravana in 'ramayana'
 kyonki team ko lagata he ki vah 'ravan' kaa kirdaar kaaphi achche se nibhaa sakate hai
 Prabhas' casting with Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone as' Ram 'and' Sita 'would be much better

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself has started a series of rallies in different parts of the state on behalf of the bjp's biggest star campaigner, but despite repeated claims from the party, the list of candidates has not yet been finalized
 Is raising questions
 congress ab bhi samaajawaadee party ke saath gathbandhan ke intjaar main apane ummidavaaron kii list latakaae hue hai to samaajawaadee party main mulaayam singh yadav or akhilesh yadav kii ore se do-do list saamne aa chuki hai
 When Keshav Prasad Maurya took over the post of UP State President of BJP, he claimed that the party would soon start the process of selection of candidates
 baad main khabar ai ki party oktober main apane pratyaashiyon ke naam kaa elaan kar degi taaki unhen chunaav kii taiyaariyon ke liye paryaapt vakt mil sake
 The party had long ago set the standard for selection of candidates, but now that the election can be announced at any time, bjp's list has not come up
 jaateey sameekaran sadhakar list taiyaar karnaa chunautiuttar pradesh main is samay bhartiya janata party ke 47 vidhayak hai
 It is believed that all the sitting mlas will be fielded once again by giving tickets on behalf of the party, but the candidates for the remaining 350 seats have not been announced until a few weeks before the election
 mana ja rahaa he ki pradhanmantri kii aaj kii lakhanu raily ke baad party kii pehali list saamne aa sakati he
 BJP President Amit Shah had hinted at a recent rally that the party will give more tickets to the youth this time, but apart from this, its biggest challenge is to find candidates who are keeping the caste equations in UP, which is the power of this country's largest state
 Could end their exile from sapa-basapa ke baagiyon par najardusri partiyon kii tarah jahaan bijepi bhi jeet kaa dam rakhane vaale candidate par hi daanv khelegi vahiin uski najar sapa or basapa ke ummidavaaron kii final list par bhi he
 Rebel candidates play a very important role in every election of UP
 sapa or basapa ke ve ummidavaar jo jeet kaa dam rakhte hai lekin tikat paane main vifal rahe hai bijepi unhen ummidavaar ke taur par utaar sakati he
 This is said to be the biggest reason for delay in his list
 ek angreji akhbaar ke mutabik bijepi kaa focus list se zyada piem modi kii raily or uske baad kisaan goshtiyon par zyada he
 The rest of the parties are also stuck
 The ruling Samajwadi Party, which has the highest number of mlas in UP, has been torn apart by the list of candidates, while on the other hand the Congress is hanging its list waiting for its possible alliance with SP
 gauratlab he ki congress ne sabase pehle yahaan apana siem candidate ghoshit kiya tha or 15 saal dilli kii mukhyamantri rahi shila dikshit ko apana netaa bataaya tha
 The main opposition party Bahujan Samaj Party had first finalized its candidates, but since then it has changed so much in that list that its final list is still awaited from its side
 bihar se aa rahi khabaren rashtriya janata dal (argedy) pramukh lalu prasad yadav ke liye utsahvardhak, to narendra modi ke liye chintajanak hai
 Votes have been cast for 27 parliamentary seats in four rounds of voting here
 30 april ko jin saat siton ke liye vot daale gaye, unamem darbhanga or madhubani bhi shaamil hai
 Here the outright vote of Muslim voters decides the candidate's defeat or victory
 aisi kareeb chah siten hai, jahaan isi tarah kii sthiti he
 Voting in Kishanganj, Bhagalpur, Katihar and Purnia has already taken place on April 24
 7 or 12 may ko baaqi bachi 13 siton ke liye matdaan hoga
 The victory of RJD candidate Abdul Bari Siddiqui in Madhubani is being considered
 haalanki yahaan bijepi ke ummidavaar hukumdev narayan yadav hai, jinke boote bijepi kuch yadav vot hasil karne main bhi kaamayaab rahi he
 But what is worrying for the BJP is that there is a talk about the distribution of Brahmin votes here
 brahman paramparaagat taur par congress party ko vot karte aa rahe the, is baar argedy kii taraf chale gaye hai
 The Congress did not field its candidate Shakeel Ahmed from here because of the rjd-congress alliance
 iskaa nateeja yah hua he ki puraa musalmaan vot argedy ko gaya he
 Siddiqui 1 last time
 62 lakh vot paakar hukumdev narayan yadav se sirf nau hazaar vot se haar gaye the
 It is worth mentioning that then Shakeel Ahmed got one lakh 10 thousand votes
 darbhanga se argedy ke emee fatmi bhi bijepi ke kirti azaad par baari nazar aa rahe hai
 Overall, Lalu's muslim-yadav equation seems to be working
 bihar kii yatra ke dauraan jo moti baat samaj main ai, vah yah ki yahaan do tarah kaa anti inkanmbency factor kaam kar rahaa he
 One is against the central government due to inflation etc
 and the other is nine years of Nitish government, in such a situation there is anti incumbency against the state government
 sadakon kaa acha hona or bijli kii haalat main sudhaar, jahaan nitish ke paksh main jaataa he, vahiin udyog dhandhe, rojgaar ke avasar kaa na badhanaa logon ko abhi bhi sata rahaa he
 The education system is still not fully on track and students continue to move out of Bihar for better studies
 panchayat str tak faile bhrashtachar se bhi nitish ke khilaaf rosh he
 This fury is playing its role against the outgoing mps of JDU
 bijepi ke nivartmaan saansadon ke kilaaf bhi yahi baat lagu hoti he
 Voters say about Hukumdev Narayan Yadav that even once in five years, they did not come to look at Dehri, far from work
 haalanki bijepi sara dosha jediu ke maathe par daalkar nikalnaa chaah rahi he, lekin vah yah bhul jaati he ki pichley saal tak gathbandhan sarkaar main shaamil thi
 But this is not the only anti-incumbency factor, due to which Nitish is lagging behind and the Congress rjd-congress alliance is going to do well
 yah bihar kii jativaadee raajnneeti kaa takaaza he, jo lalu ko ek baar upar uthaa rahaa he
 The breaking of the JDU-BJP alliance ended the winning formula, which proved to be a panacea for Nitish
 bijepi main modi ke chadhane ke saath hi musalmaan voton kaa dhruvikaran bihar main sabase zyaada rang dikhaa rahaa he
 On getting the opportunity, Lalu added this time's election to the dignity of the Yadavs
 vah yadavon main yah bhav bharne main kaamayaab rahe hai ki nitish ke raaj main yadavon kii pratishtha ko aghat pahunchaa he
 On the other hand, he has been able to give this message to the Muslims that only he can fight with strength against bjp-modi
 yahi vajah he ki schuli bacchon ke liye nitish kii cycle yojana jaisi nitiyon ko saraahne vaale musalmaan bhi is baar jediu se dur ja chuke hai
 Overall, Lalu's MY equation is climbing
 aise main vah maujuuda chaar se badhkar 14-15 yaa usase bhi kuch zyaada siten hasil kar len, to achambha nahin hona chahie
 This success could have been bigger, but in many seats, JDU candidates are making it difficult for the RJD in the form of vote katua
 udhaaharan ke liye bhagalpur kii seat ko len, jahaan argedy ke bulo mandal kii jeet kii gunjaaish bahut adhik he, lekin jediu ne yahaan abu kaisar ko maidan main utarkar musalmaan vot main send lagane kii koshish kii he, jiskaa faaydaa bijepi ke shahanwaaz hossain ko mil saktaa he
 As far as the Modi wave is concerned, when people look at the alternative between the anti-incumbency against the Center and the state government, they see only Modi's face
 badlaav ke naam par log modi kii taraf hi nihaar rahe hai
 There is no doubt that the Hindu vote has also polarized in response to the polarization of Muslim votes, which is beneficial for the BJP
 ramvilas paswan ke algepi se gathbandhan kaa faaydaa bhi bijepi ko ho rahaa he
 Overall, the bjp's tally could be around 18-20
 yah pichhali baar ke 12 ke mukaable kahin adhik hogi
 But it will not be like what was said and claimed as Modi wave or Modi's wind
 bijepi yah badhotaree bhi jediu kii qeemat par karegi, jisaki siton kii taadaad 20 se simat kar 4-5 par aa sakati he
 So let's say that Nitish's balloon of hope is going to blow in Bihar
 vahiin modi kii hawa bhi jamini haqikat se upar bah rahi he

 There is nothing that the audience does not know
 beshak retro kaa jamaana he lekin aise daur main jab hai drama suspence thriller or masala filmein ban rahi hai, nai kahaniyaan likhi ja rahi hai, is maamle main yah film thodaa niraash karti he
 There are some small scenes that tickle but overall there is a lack of freshness in the story
 sajid kii koshish phultu antertenment kii rahi he
 But this time he seems to be missing
 star apigajay devgan kii acting hameshaa kii tarah acchhee he
 There is a lot of applause on his entry
 lekin aise maukey bahut kam hi aate hai, jab audiyans ko taaliyaan bajaane kaa mauka mili
 The surprise package of this film is South sensation Tamannaah Bhatia
 unki acting main dam he
 Dance is awesome
 screen par unhen dekhnaa ankhon ko acha lagata he
 The biggest thing is that when they come on screen, there are lots of applause and whistles
 unka yah dialog khub jamata he, 'aai het garib
 Paresh Rawal is the real life of the film, if you say so
 jab bhi ve aate hai gudguda jate hai
 His character of Narayan Das is madamast
 unke dialog hansaate hai jaise, 'haath he yaa hathaudaa, in keedon ke bich yah kahaan se aa gaya makoda
 'mahesh Manjrekar has also acted fiercely
 kamai kii batsajid khan kii 'he baby', 'housephul' 1-2 kii apeksha yah film unniis hi lagati he
 But there is a spice of spice
 first ro ke audiyans ke liye scope he
 The film can do good business in small centers and single screens
 aise eks factors kam hai jo ise youth ke saath conect kar saken
 That's all, you have to watch the film without any load
 baaki sara kaam hero 'himmatwala' kar legaa
 But on the tongue of a spectator coming out, it was said that 1983's 'himmatwala' was much better

 Chhattisgarh Police, who has been meditating for three days about the mysterious kidnapping, breathed a sigh of relief after a whatsapp message
 police kii ek team aparankarta kii giraftaar ke liye jharkhand kii rajdhani ranchi ravaanaa kar di gayi he
 The case is about an eight-year-old Vedanta
 vedant ko ek car par savaar aparaadhiyon ne apharan kar liya he
 By the time the information of the kidnapping reached Vedanta's family and the police, the car had already gone 250 kilometers from Raipur
 raipur ke harsh vihaar colony ke garden main rojaanaa kii tarah bachche khel rahe the
 Suddenly a white colored SUV car arrived in the evening and two people descended from it
 donon ne kuch baccho se baat kii, phir aath saal ke vedant somani se kuch der ve log baat karte rahe
 Then these people put Vedanta in that car
 shaam ko colony ke saare bachche apane ghar laut gaye
 Due to not reaching Vedanta, there was chaos in his house
 maamla police thane main darj karaayaa gaya
 During preliminary investigation, it was found that an SUV car from Jharkhand was entered in this area
 car main baithe logon kii pahchaan nahin ho pai he
 The investigation of the case started when it was found that Vedanta's mother was having a conflict with her father
 iske chalate mata-pita donon alag rah rahe hai
 However, it could not be confirmed whether the people sitting in the SUV were aware of Vedanta's father Rajesh Somani or anyone else
 police ne agyaat aropiyon ke khilaaf apharan kaa maamla darj kar jharkhand kii ore jane vaale margon kii nakebandi kar di
 Vedanta's mother and family provided 16 mobile numbers of Rajesh Somani to the police
 un nambaron kii kol detail or lokation khangaali gayi
 During this time a number of these locations were found in Nandghat area of chhattisgarh
 jharkhand police or chhattisgarh police ke afasaron ne vivechna ko saajha karte hue aropiyon kii talaashi ke liye ranchi main muhim chhedi
 During this time a whatsapp message has come up saying that Vedanta is fine, but after this message the mobile is turned off
 udhar rajesh somani ne ghatana ke bare main kuch bhi nahin maaloom hone kii baat kahi
 At present, this case is entangled between kidnapping or mutual tussle

 The police feel that the reality will be revealed only after questioning him
 sidney test ke pehle din umesh yadav ne 97 ran kharche, aar aswin ne 88 ran, bhubaneshwar kumaar ne 67 ran, mo shami ne 58 ran or part time gendbaaz suresh raina ne 35 ran
 This figure can be intimidating for any team
 baat sirf ye nahin ki sidney main flat pich par david warner And Chris Rodgers batted smog and Warner completed his third Test and 12th career century in the series
 team india ke liye afsosna yah he ki gendbaaz ek baar phir fike dikhe or behad kharchile bhi sabit hue
 Team India used five bowlers on day one
 team india ke sabhi gendbaazon ne teen ran prati over kii dar se zyaada ran kharche
 Umesh Yadav then spent 97 runs in 16 overs
 pehle din kamyaabi bhi sirf aar aswin or mo
 Shami only got it
 bhartiya team kii ye mushkil nai nahin he, tej gendbaazon The difficulties that have been presented throughout the series have been discussed a lot
 mushkil yah he ki pichley teen saal main bhartiya spinners bhi naakaam sabit hue hai
 That is, it is difficult for Team India to bowl fast
 spin gendbaazi, jo kabhi team india kii taaqat hoti thi, aankadon ke lihaaz se duniya main sabase fisaddi sabit ho rahi he
 Just look at these figures which are being shown repeatedly on TV during the Sydney Test: yani test khilne vaale desh kii list main bharat kaa number bangladesh or zimbabwe jaisi tiimon ke bhi baad aakiri number par aata he
 This is an increasing concern for team management
 zaahir he bisisiai ko bhi apni yojanaon ko lekar phir vichaar karnaa hoga
 There was a time when Team India used to get on the field with one or two not four spinners and also won
 1981 main hue melbern test ke dauraan team india ne captain bishan singh bedi kii aguai main mezbaan australia ko 222 ranon se shikast di thi
 In that Test, the Indian team took 18 wickets by Bishan Singh Bedi (left-arm spinner), Erapalli Prasanna (right-arm off-spinner) and Bhagwat Chandrasekhar (leg-spinner)
 bhartiya cricket itihaas main aise or bhi kai udhaaharan hai
 In the current round, the Indian team is not playing with pacers or spinners
 shaayad kuch tii-20 kaa asar he to kuch khilaadiyon ke ravaiye kaa
 But the loss of all this is visible to Indian cricket continuously

 Team India captain Cool Mahendra Singh Dhoni has spoken openly on the Ravindra Jadeja and James Anderson controversy for the first time
 dhoni ne jadeja ko di gai sajaa ko bina vajah qaraar dete hue isisi ke faisle ko dukhad bataaya he
 Dhoni said, 'for me it is a very sad decision
 mujhe lagata he ki is maamle par faisla karte hue bahut si baton ko andekha kiya gaya
 It is worth mentioning that when this dispute took place between Jadeja and Anderson at Trent Bridge, Dhoni was present as his fellow batsman
 dhoni ne puraa ghatnakram bataate hue kaha, 'main is maamle main kisi or kaa naam nahin lenaa chahta
 But we were going from the ground to the stadium that an English cricketer uttered abuses for Jadeja
 mujhe bich bachaav ke liye aana padaa or jab ham maidan se baahar nikalne hi vaale the ki maamla or bighad gaya
 "dhoni said," Jadeja was just a few yards from me when he came out of the ground
 unhen kuch galat baaten kahi gayi, jis par vah kehane vaale vyakti kii taraf palate to unhen dhakka de diya gaya
 Jadeja could barely manage to fall
 vah peeche yah dekhne ke liye muda ki aakhir ho kya rahaa he, or us par peeche ghoomane ke liye jurmaana laga diya gaya
 Significantly, the ICC found Jadeja guilty of violating the ICC Code of Conduct Category-1 in a quarrel between jadeja-anderson
 shuukravaar ko team india ke is olerounder par match ke 50 fisadi fees kaa jurmaana lagaaya gaya
 Jadeja was accused of category-2 violations after the England Cricket Board (ECB) filed a complaint
 maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue match referi david boon ne kaha tha ki vah isse sahamat nahin hai ki jadeja ne shrenee-2 kaa ulanghan kiya he
 However, Boone said that Jadeja is guilty of behaving against the spirit of the game
 pati-patni yaa garlfriend-boyfriend ko ladane ke liye zaruri nahin ki koi badi baat hi chahie ho
 Couples can fight a lot even on small matters
 lekin kabhi-kabhaar ladaai kii vajah bahut hi ajibo-garib ban jaati he
 Just like in this case where the boyfriend only fought over the fact that his girlfriend bought a cold drink of Rs 30 and drank
 maamla china kaa he
 Here a couple came out on an outing
 puri dopaher garlfriend ne pani tak nahin piya
 But before coming back home, she did not tolerate thirst and drank by buying a cold drink
 ladki ne bataaya, 'mere boyfriend ne jaise hi mujhe cold drink pite hue dekha wo bahut gussa ho gaya
 
 
 And he told me that i am not 'wife Material' (worthy of becoming a wife)
 ' ye baat ladki ne soshal media par khud bataai
 According to ET Today, the price of the bottle for this cold drink was only RMB3 (only 30 Indian rupees)
 isliye ladki ko ye bilkul mahangi nahi lagi
 The boyfriend said, 'we were about to arrive home in a while, you bought a cold drink in Fizool
 ye tumhaari sehat ke liye acchhee nahin
 Going home, you could drink water, it would be good for your health too
 Let me tell you, this couple has been with each other for seven years
 garlfriend ke cold drink kharidne par boyfriend ne use apane doston kii garlfrends se comper bhi kiya or kaha ki, 'wo baahar jate hue pani bag main lekar chalati hai
 She is younger than you but more intelligent
 wo wif material hai tum nahin
 i hope that this does not happen after today
 main aisi ladki kii talash main hum jo ghar kii dekhbhaal kare naa tumhaari tarah kharchili ho
 After seeing the post of the girl on social media, people advised her for a breakup

 On the one hand, the entire government of Uttar Pradesh including Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is eating food in the house of Dalits, on the other hand, Yogi has focused his attention on the 2019 elections by talking about reservation within reservation
 do up-chunaav main mili haar ke baad yogi adityanath ne vidhansabha main yah elaan kiya tha ki sarkaar jald hi pichhadi jatiyon or daliton main aarakshan ke bheetar aarakshan kaa praavdhaan kar sakati he
 This formula of reservation within reservation is a hit in states like Bihar
 usee tarj par ab uttar pradesh main bhi aise hi aarakshan kii bisaat bichaane kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 The Yogi government had indicated within the Legislative Assembly that it wanted to form a sub-group of the most backward and backward castes among the Dalits in which reservation could reach all castes
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki 2019 se pehle sarkaar aarakshan ke bheetar aarakshan lagu kar sakati he, jiske tahat pichhadi jatiyon ke cote main ek or kota tay kiya jayega jisamen samrudh pichhadi jatiyon ko chhodkar duusari pichhadi jatiyon kaa ek kota taiyaar kiya jaae, jo abhi tak aarakshan ke laabh se jamini taur par vanchit hai or aarakshan kaa puraa laabh pichhadi jatiyon ke ek yaa do tabake hi uthaa rahe hai
 According to Om Prakash Rajbhar, a minister in the Yogi government, the government may take a final decision in this regard 6 months before the election and he has discussed this with the Chief Minister and Amit Shah
 om prakaash rajbhar ne kaha ki aarakshan ke bheetar aarakshan lagu karne ke liye yogi sarkaar rajnath singh ke dwaara june 2001 main banaae gaye saamaajik nyaay samiti kii report ko aadhaar bana sakati he, jisamen sarkaar pichhadi jatiyon main 'e' 'bi' or 'si' teen sab- category bana sakati he
 According to the report of the Social Justice Committee, about 2 percent of the 27 percent reservation for the backward
 3 fisadi jatiyaan hi pichhadi jatiyon kaa puraa aarakshan nigal jaati hai
 In such a situation, reservation should be divided into three categories: Backward, Extremely Backward and Extremely Backward
 'e' category main yadav or ahir sareekhee sampann jatiyaan hongi jabaki 'bi' category ati pichhadi hogi jisamen kushvaha, maury, shakya, saini jaisi duusari jatiyaan hongi jabaki atyant pichhadi jatiyon main mallaah, nishad, badhai, lohaar jaisi jatiyaan hongi
 Apart from the quota of backward castes, the BJP has also talked about the provision of reservation within the Dalit castes
 yani daliton main samrudh jatiyaan alag ho or daliton main jo jatiyaan aaj bhi haashie par hai unhen ati dalit kii shrenee main rakhkar daliton ke cote se unhen aarakshan diya jaae
 26% obcs, 21% Dalits, 19% Forward and 14% Muslims are considered as the whole population
 BJP isi 26% obisi or 21%dalit aarakshanke bheetar aarakshan kaa praavdhaan karnaa chaahati he
 Talking of the efforts of the then Chief Minister Rajnath Singh in 2001, Rajnath formed a committee under the chairmanship of Hukum Singh to give reservation to every caste in Dalits and backward in proportion to its number
 cameti kii report ko vidhansabha main paarit bhi kar diya gaya tha, lekin unki hi sarkaar main mantri ashok yadav iske khilaaf court chale gaye the
 The court had stayed the report of this committee
 upachunaav main haar ke baad hue vidhansabha satr ke dauraan 22 march 2018 ko mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne jarurat padane par ati daliton or ati pichhadon ko alag aarakshan kota dene kaa elaan kiya tha, cameti gathit karne kii ghoshnaa karte hue kaha tha ki cameti kin−kin muddon par vichaar karegi, yah tay hona abhi baaki he
 It was started by the then CM Rajnath Singh in 2001 when he divided the Dalits into two categories based on the report of the Social Justice Committee
 pehali shrenee 'e' main jatav or dhoosia rakhe gaye the or duusari shrenee 'bi' main 65duusari dalit jatiyanrkhi gai thi
 It was recommended to give 10% reservation to castes placed in category 'A' and 11% to Dalit fraternities in category 'B'
 ho saktaa he yogi sarkaar is praavdhaan ko jyon kaa tyon lagu kar de kyonki ise daliton ke bheetar ek bada aisa tabaka dikhataa he jo BJP kaa voter ban chukaa hepichade varg ko bhi teen shreniyon main baantne kii sifarish thi
 The total quota was recommended to be 28% instead of 27%
 pehali category 'e' main yadav or ahir rakhe gaye the
 It was advocated to give 5% reservation to the backward of this category
 jat, kurmi, lodh va gujars jaisi aath pichhadi jatiyon ko 'bi' category main rakhaa gaya tha or unhen 9% aarakshan dene kii sifarish kii gai thi
 In the 'C' category, it was said to give 14% reservation quota to 70 backward communities
 BJP kii puri najar isi 46% vot bank par tiki hui he use lagata he ki agar isamen vah yadav or ahir sareekhee jatiyon ko alag kar duusari pichhadi jatiyon ke vot le legi to vah phir satta main aa jaaegi

 VK Singh further said that if a man does not understand about the Rafale deal, no matter how much he understands it, he will understand it right there
 isamen unke salaahkaar bhi bahut hai jo har cheez par vivaad khadaa karte hai
 The minister said that the Supreme Court has clearly stated in this case, in such a case, they should make peace and talk about the development of the country
 kendriya mantri ne kaha ki jo cheez desh kii suraksha ke liye jaruri he us cheez ko virdohi halke-phulke tareeke se le rahe hai
 He said that the Air Force needs aircraft, if there is a fight, who will save the country
 wike singh ne kaha ki pichley 4 saal main modi sarkaar ne senaaon ke liye bahut koshish kii he hamaare yahaan jo prakriya he usamen sudhaar kii jarurat he

 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main congress or bijepi puri tarah se aamane-saamne aa gaye hai
 The veteran leaders of both the parties are attacking each other in a befitting manner
 congress ne chunaav prachaar main rahul gandhi ke saath hi sonia gandhi ko bhi chunaav prachaar main utaar diya he
 On Tuesday, while addressing an election rally in Bijapur, Sonia Gandhi attacked PM Modi and BJP President Amit Shah in a befitting manner
 unhone kaha ki piem modi par congress mukt bharat kaa bhoot chadha hua he
 Sonia Gandhi said that Siddaramaiah government started Indira canteen, under which food is available for 10 rupees
 centre kii modi sarkaar karnataka ke saath bhedbhaav kar rahi he
 Siddaramaiah government of Congress has made Karnataka the number one state
 piem modi par sidhaa hamalaa bolte hue sonia gandhi ne kaha ki jab congress ne deshbhar main logon ko rojgaar dene ke liye manaregaa lagu kiya, to khud bijepi or modi ne virodh kiya tha
 Modi insults farmers and their families: Sonia Our Annadata farmers have been struggling with many difficulties for the last few years
 pichley chaar saal main dashakon se zyada sookhaa padaa
 On this, PM Modi refused to give help, even refused to meet the CM
 modi ne sirf siem kaa hi nahin, balki kisaanon or unke parivaar kaa bhi apmaan kiya
 The ex-congress president said that Siddaramaiah made loans of 22 lakh farmers
 It is also surprising that the Modi government has given thousands of crores to the states where there was a drought
 par karnataka ke logon ke ghaavon par namak chhidakte hue kuch nahin diya
 Is this Modi's 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'
 haalanki iske baavjood siddharmaiya ne kisaan bhaaiyon ko is musiibat se nikaalane ke liye 22 lakh kisaanon ke karj maaf kiye
 Sonia said - Modi has got the ghost of a free India
 He said that the Congress government is constantly working for development, while the Modi government is working to eliminate them
 modi par congress mukt bharat kaa junun chadha he
 
 
 Congress is the ghost of a free India
 
 
 
 Leave Congress free India, they cannot tolerate anyone in front of them
 'bhaashan dene se nahin bharta pet'sonia ne kaha ki modi ko is baat kaa garv he ki wo acha bhaashan dete hai
 He is like a big orator and actor
 agar unke bhaashan se desh kaa pet bhar saktaa he, to wo or bhaashan den
 Modi's speech cannot fill the stomach, cannot provide employment and farmers cannot get relief and facilities
 in sabake liye majboot iraadaa chahie
 During the continuous increase in the prices of petrol, diesel and gas, Sonia also took a dig at the Modi government on the issue of inflation
 unhone kaha ki aaj mahangaai aasmaan chhu rahi hai
 Every section of the society is facing problems
 shaayad aisa pehle kabhi nahin hua, lekin in sabaki parvaah na kar modi sarkaar lagaataar petrol, dijal or gharelu gas kii keemten badhaati ja rahi he
 Modi using great men for politics: In retaliation for soniamodi's attack, Sonia said that the country is surprised to see that pms speak wrong wherever they go
 mahaan swadhinata senaniyon kaa raajnneetik istemaal shatranj ke moharon kii tarah karte hai
 Does such a thing suit a PM? Have you ever seen a PM who only talks and remains silent on the real issue
 sonia ne piem modi par daage kai sawalis bich sonia ne piem modi par kai sawaal bhi daage
 He asked which of the promises Modi made to the public four years ago? What have you done for the farmers, youth, middle class, women, girls, Dalits and backward people of the country in such a time? They asked what happened to your favorite promise to eradicate corruption? Why was the Lokpal not finally brought after four years? To eradicate corruption, Modi will adopt the model of those who live around the stage in Karnataka or the model of the son of his closest partner
 do saal baad chunaav prachaar karne utrin sonia gandhisonia gandhi uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav se pehle teen agast 2016 ko piem modi ke sansadeey ilaake varanasi main road sho karne utari thim

 "rajbhar said that Muslims have given much to India and this cannot be denied
 rajbhar ne kaha aaj bhaajapa kii sarkaar he lekin mahangaai kii maar janata jhel rahi he
 No big leader of the ruling party is agitating on the road

 The Supreme Court has been relieved by the telecom companies against the Delhi High Court order giving compensation to customers on call drop
 supreme court ne kaha he ki tri muaavje ke formule par ek baar phir se vichaar kare
 At first glance, it seems that TRAI did not pay much attention to the technical aspect while issuing the compensation order
 kol drops maamle main mobile sarvice prowider companiyon ne supreme court main kaha tha ki kol drops ke liye mobile companiyaan jimmedaar nahin hai
 There are many reasons behind the call drop
 inamen upabhoktaaon ke dwaara istemaal kiye gaye mobile phone, mobile tower se duuri or surang yaa phir jaimar lage aria yaa phir mobile companiyon ke cabel katane jaise maamle jimmedaar hai
 This case is not based on radio wave but like electricity
 vahiin nigam companiyon ke tower sil kar raheen hai jo kol drop ko badha raheen hai to duusari taraf tri companiyon par muaavja dene ke aadesh jari kar rahaa he
 It was said by the companies that there is no country in the world where there is no call drop
 colombia ekmaatr aisa desh he jahaan kol drop par jurmaana lagaaya jaataa he
 The comments duniya main har jagah 2 se 5 fisadi kol drops kaa ausat mana jaataa he
 It is 2% in India
 jab 2 fisadi sweekaarya he to ham par ye jurmaana kyon lagaaya ja rahaa he
 In fact, the High Court had rejected the petition filed by the telecom companies, saying that they would have to pay compensation to the customers if the call drops
 hoicourt ne kaha ki companiyon ko apane upabhoktaaon ko yah muaavja 1 janvari 2016 se dena hoga
 TRAI issued an order on 16 October 2015 that the telecom service companies, if the call drops, will pay 1 rupee as compensation to the consumer, which can be 3 rupees in a day
 iske khilaaf mobile companiyon ne dilli hoicourt main yachika daayar kii thi
 Companies argued that this order of TRAI is arbitrary and illegal, it should be canceled
 pehali najar main lag rahaa he ki tri ne muaavje ke aadesh ko jari karte hue takneekee paksh par zyada gaur nahin kiya
 In the call drop case, the mobile service provider companies had said in the Supreme Court that mobile companies are not responsible for the call drop
 kol drops hone ke peeche kai kaaran hai
 These include cases such as mobile phones used by consumers, distance from mobile towers and tunnels or jammed areas or cable disconnection of mobile companies
 ye maamla bijli kii tarah nahin balki radio wave par aadhaarit he
 At the same time, corporations are sealing towers of companies, which are increasing the call drop, while on the other hand, TRAI is issuing orders to give compensation to companies
 companiyon kii ore se kaha gaya ki duniya main aisa koi desh nahin jahaan kol drops na hota ho
 Colombia is the only country where call drop is fined
 tippaniyan Everywhere in the world an average of 2 to 5 percent call drop is considered
 bharat main yah 2 fisadi he
 When 2% is acceptable then why are we being fined
 darasal hoicourt ne telecom companiyon kii ore se daayar yachika ko khaarij karte hue kaha tha ki unhen kol drop hone par graahakon ko muaavja dena hi hoga
 The High Court said that companies will have to pay this compensation to their consumers from January 1, 2016
 tri ne 16 oktober 2015 ko aadesh jari kiya tha ki telecom sarvice companiyaan, agar kol drops hota he to 1 rupaya upabhokta ko bataur muaavja dengi jo ek din main 3 rupee ho saktaa he
 Mobile companies had filed a petition in the Delhi High Court against this
 companiyon kii daleel thi ki tri kaa ye aadesh manamaana or gaiyrkanoonee he, ise radd kiya jaae

 30pm IST TODAY 
 RT To Show Your Love — EFSENA (@EFSENAROCKS) June 29, 2015 Input: IANS arvind kejariwal ke ghar par hui, political afaire kamity (PAC) kii baithak main kumaar vishwaas ko mili nai jimmedaariyon ne philhal aam aadmi party ke jhagade ko shant kar diya he
 But still the big question is whether this peace precedes any storm
 kyonki 'aap' netaaon kii 3 ghante tak chali PAC baithak kaa makasad maujuuda vivaad ko khatm karnaa hi tha
 According to sources in the Aam Aadmi Party, the controversial statement of MLA Amanatullah Khan was discussed first in the Political Affairs Committee, where Khan described Kumar Vishwas as an agent of BJP
 charchaa ke baad amanatullah ko suspend karne kaa faisla karte hue ek kamity bana di gai, jo khan ke bayaan kii jaanch karegi
 But after this action, Manish Sisodia's visit to Amanatullah Khan's house can definitely knock Kumar Vishwas, because he has suspected some big face of the party behind Amanatullah's statement
 kumaar vishwaas rajasthan kaa prabhaar paakar khushpolitical afaire kamity main kumaar vishwaas apni maangon kii lambii fehrist lekar pahunche the
 According to sources, Kumar Vishwas is happy to take charge of Rajasthan as he himself wanted this post
 darasal andolan ke baad jab aam aadmi party bani to kumaar vishwaas ke alaava tamaam bade netaa sarkaar par kaabiz ho gaye or alag-alag rajyon kaa prabhaar bhi sambhaal liya
 Kumar Vishwas was constantly watching this matter, understanding it
 iske baad party ke bheetar halaat itane bighad gaye kii kumaar vishwaas kii naaraazgi jagazahir ho gai
 This is the reason that the depressed face of Kumar Vishwas, among the many smiling faces of the AAP Political Affairs Committee after the PAC meeting, could be a sign of some big controversy in the coming days
 kumaar vishwaas rashtrawaad ke har mudde kaa samarthan karengeam aadmi party ke mukhiya kaa sargical strike par sawaal uthaanaa bhi kumaar vishwaas ko pasand nahi aayaa tha
 According to sources, this was the reason that in the meeting of the Political Affairs Committee, it was also discussed that the party would not oppose the issue of nationalism
 yahi vajah thi kii kumaar vishwaas ne apane video par maafi maangane se saaf inkaar kar diya tha
 It was discussed during the meeting that Kumar Vishwas will support every issue of nationalism which the party will not oppose
 sawaal jo aam aadmi party ke sheersh netritv kii mushkil badha sakate hai1
 Was there any action on corruption questions arising out of ticket distribution? 2
 kya kumaar vishwaas kii udaasi kii vajah unke khilaaf party ke bheetar hui saazish he?3
 Will Kejriwal manage the situation before it is divided into two factions of mlas and activists? On April 14, ten days before the MCD election, Kumar Vishwas released a video, referring to the ongoing corruption within the Aam Aadmi Party, on Arvind Kejriwal itself Questions were raised
 sutron ke mutabik buudhvaar ko hui political afaire kamity main ye tay hua kii kisi bhi netaa ke bhrashtachar kii jaankaree aane par virdohi dalon ko kosne kii bajaay aam aadmi party ection legi taaki ek majboot sandesh kaaryakartaaon or janata ke bich ja sake
 However, this issue was not discussed in detail
 sawaal ye uthta he ki kya piesi kii baithak main is baat par charchaa hui kii kaaryakartaaon ko party se dobaaraa kaise joda jaae, taaki pichhali chunavi haar dobaaraa na jhelni pade
 At present, the biggest question is that Arvind Kejriwal has controlled the damage in the party, in front of the terms of Kumar Vishwas, but has the internal dispute of the Aam Aadmi Party ended? Will Amanatullah Khan sit silently, or will Kejriwal forget the statements of Kumar Vishwas
 aise kai sawaalon ke jawaab milanaa abhi baaki hai
 However, uniting the AAP mlas who are seen to be divided into two parts by this dispute, has become the biggest challenge for Arvind Kejriwal at the moment
 pichley kaaphi lambey samay se bharat or china ke bich tanatani bad rahi he
 In Doklam near Sikkim, the armies of both the countries are face to face on the border, while China through its official newspaper is also giving a great deal of gloom
 china kaa kahana he ki bharat border se apni sena ko hataa le
 At the same time, the Chinese newspaper has clearly written in its article that China is ready for any kind of conflict with India
 bharat ko daraakar or yuddh kii dhamkee dekar china puri duniya ko kai sandesh dena chahta he
 1
 wo asia kii eklauti mahashakti hachin pichley kuch dashakon main kaaphi teji se aage badha he, phir chaahe vah arthvyavastha kaa masalaa ho yaa phir sainya takat ho
 But in the last decade, India has also emerged as a major power, PM Modi says in almost every speech that the whole world is eyeing Asia and all eyes are on India in Asia as well
 china bharat par dabaav banaakar yah darshana chahta he ki asia main vah eklauti mahashakti he or bharat ko apane saamne bouna sabit karne kii koshish karegaa
 2
 dakshin china sagar main virdohi deshon ko sakht sandeshbharat hi nahin china kii apane 14 padosi deshon ke saath talkh rishte hai
 China has faced many big countries of the world on the issue of South China Sea
 america, japan or bharat samet kai bade desh is mudde par china ko naseehat de chuke hai
 On Tuesday, the United States and Australia have warned about China's growing political and military ambitions in the midst of China's obstinate attitude in India and the South China Sea
 sheersh pentagon commander ne jahaan asia prashanth kshetra main china ke sainya jamaavade ko lekar, to australia ne dakshin china sagar par prabhutv sthapit karne kii chini tikadam kaa virodh kiya he
 3
 aarthik hiton main koi nahin bane baadha (OBOR main baadha bana tha bharat)chini raashtrapati shi jinping kaa dream project van belt, van road main sabase bada roda bharat hi he
 Part of this project of China passes through Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, which India has objected to
 bharat kii aapatti par kai desh uske saath aa chuke hai
 When OBOR was launched, no representative from India went there despite the invitation
 china kaa yah project china ko sidhe taur par europe se jod degaa
 China wants to give a message to India by making it appear small that if anyone comes in its way, it will have a great impact
 4
 US President Donald Trump has been seen opposing China on every front, direct challenge to US siege and Trump policy
 america china ke mudde par bhi lagaataar bharat, japan ke saath khadaa rahaa he
 China wants to respond to America by realizing its power
 trump kii america first niti china ke aarthik sapane ko bhi jhatka detii he
 By taking a tough stand on India, China is directly trying to openly challenge America
 trump prashasan ne china ke kattar virdohi taiwan ko hathiyaar bechney ko bhi manjuuri de di he
 The Trump administration also has good relations with India
 aise main china border par tanaav badhaakar america ko bhi sandesh dena chahta he
 5
 aantarik raajnneeti main shi jinping kii sakhti ko dikhaanaa he2013 main chini raashtrapati ke pad par baithe shi jinping 2018 se pehle communist party ke manch par phir apana pregentation denge
 They have to show the promises made before the party and the work being done for the strong image of China
 2013 main jab jinping to is pad par savaar ho rahe the, tab unhone apane agenda main china ko mahashakti banane kaa lakshya rakhaa tha
 At the same time, the blueprint of expanding the border and economic strength of China was also drawn
 ab 2018 main dobaaraa is pad ke liye jab jinping apni daavedaari pesh karenge to vah yah bataanaa chahenge ki unke kaarykaal main china ne kitni tarakkee kii he, or china kii chhavi ko majboot kiya he
 That is why China is trying to show strictness with neighboring countries

 Senior BJP leader and Union Minister Najma Heptulla is once again targeting minority leaders
 najma hepatulla ne shanivaar ko mumbai main alpsankhyak netaaon se mulaakaat kii
 Actually she came to Mumbai to oversee the programs of National Minorities Development and Financial Authority and Maulana Azad National Academy for Skills
 moulana azaad neshnal academy for skills ke tahat kendra sarkaar 31 march 2015 tak 10,000 yuvaaon ko naukari dene kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 But during the meeting the subject turned to the issue of Muslim and Maratha reservation in Maharashtra
 pichley maheene rajya sarkaar ne vidhansabha main maratha aarakshan vidheyak to rakhaa, lekin muslim aarakshan vidheyak par usne pehle kanoonee mashvire kii baat kahi
 In fact, the congress-ncp government had promised Maratha and Muslim reservations just before the assembly elections
 is par Minority Affairs Minister Heptulla said, 'if the Congress government really wanted to give reservation to Muslims, it would not wait for ten years, they announced it just 2 months before the election
 
 
 jabaki unhen achche se pataa tha ki ve chunaav haarane vaale hai
 Will the minority trust their patronage? ' He also said that this government is working rather than promising
 ham alpsankhyakon ko is kaabil bana rahe hai ki ve apane liye kuch karen or aarakshan ke mohataaj naa rahen
 Reservation based on religion is completely wrong and should not be
 haalanki is dauraan najma hepatulla ne vivaadit ghar vaapasi par koi sawaal lene se inkaar kar diya or kaha ki yah maamla unke mantralay se nahin judaa he

 aaj se takreeban 22 saal pehle 12 march 1993 ko sirf do ghante or 12 minute main mumbai ke seene par 12 dhamaake hue
 After these series of blasts, when smoke started coming in, around 700 people were moaning among 257 dead bodies in the whole city
 aatanki hamale ke gunahagaaron kaa cheharaa anderworld don daaud ibrahim or uske gurgon kii surat main benakaab hua, vahiin ab baari mumbai dhamaakon ke sabase bade planter yaqub memon ke aakhri anjaam kii he
 The day of Yakub being hanged for killing innocents has been suspended
 isi ke saath shuru ho chukaa he uske maut kaa count down
 On July 30, 2015, one of the culprits of the Mumbai serial blasts, Ekayakub Memonka is going to be the result, which Hindustan has been waiting for 22 years
 hindustan kii sabase badi adaalat kii sabase oonchi kursi par baithe shaks ke hukum ke baad isi roj nagpur jail main subah 7 baje yaqub abdul rajjak cememiu urf yaqub memon ko faansee ke fande par latakaane kaa din mukarrar hua he
 The police investigation, the clues and the truth after the blasts that took Mumbai from 12 places to gather clues from the chance-to-act and lead the culprits to the task were not easy for the police and the court
 baharhaal, suraag mili or tafteesh aage badi to jald hi sachai kii roshni main wo do chehre bhi benakaab ho gaye, jinke dimag se yekhaufnak sazishbaahar nikali thi
 One of them was Dawood Ibrahim, the underworld don and the head of d Company, the other was his close and d Company's Lieutenant Tiger Memon
 ye or baat he ki jab tak police ko tiger memon or daaud ibrahim kaa pataa chalaa, donon hindustan kii sarhad se dur ja chuke the
 a total of 129 people were initiated by the Mumbai Police in this connection, out of which hundred were ultimately declared guilty
 inhen sau logon main ek naam tha tiger memon ke bhai or memon parivaar ke sabase padhe likhe shaks yaqub memon kaa
 However, after the Mumbai blasts, Yakub was also among those who escaped from India, but later the Nepali police nabbed him from Kathmandu Airport
 iske baad memon parivaar ke kai duusare logon ke saath yaqub memon par bhi mukadmaa chalaa, lekin tafteesh kii roshni main yaqub ke daaman par begunaahon ke khun ke kuch itane chhinte najar aae ki aakhirkaar mumbai kii khaas tada court ne usefaansee kii sajasuna di or isi sajaa par 21 march 2013 ko jahaan supreme court ne apni muhar laga di, vahiin supreme court ke is faisle ke baad memon kii ore se di gai raham kii arji ko bhi raashtrapati ne khaarij kar diya
 Pakistan was sent for training, it was Yakub Memon who sent the d Company operatives to Pakistan for the training of the blasts
 ye yaqub memon hi tha, jisane dhamaakon ke liye barood kaa intjaam kiya or ye yaqub memon hi tha, jisane mumbai kii sadakon ko begunaahon ke khan se laal kar diya
 Despite the 22 long years of the Mumbai blasts, two of these are still miles away from the Indian border and the law of India, but the third and the biggest planter of this attack is now reaching its end
 dhamaakon main memon parivaar ke shaamil hone kii baat saamne aane ke saath hi police ne is parivaar ke duusare logon ke saath-saath yaqub kii bhi talash shuru kar di thi
 But in those days he was in Pakistan, but later arrested him from Nepal
 iske baad yaqub ke khilaaf jin dhaaraon main mukadmaa chalaa or uske khilaaf jaise-jaise subut police ke haath lage, wo uske taabut main lagane vaala ek-ek keel sabit hua
 Yakub Memon was found guilty of criminal conspiracy in the crime list and the Sajamumbai bomb blasts
 yahi wo dhara thi, jisaki badaulat use adaalat ne sajaa-e-maut yani faansee kii sajaa sunai
 It was Memon who bought tickets and booked air tickets for the convicts through east-west Travels, who were sent to Pakistan to train the blasts
 itnaa hi nahin usee ne in gunahagaaron ke pakistan main rahane or thaharne kaa itanjam bhi kiya or wo gaadiyaan bhi kharidin, jinamein mumbai main alag-alag jagahon par bam plant kiya gaya
 In this crime he was sentenced to life imprisonment
 yaqub ko aslhe or barood kaa intjaam karne or unhen duusare gunahagaaron tak pahunchane ke maamle main bhi gunahagaar paaya gaya or is gunaah main use 14 saal kaid bamashkkat kii sajaa sunai gai
 Read further, how a scooter is a patient of all the misdeeds, Yakub was also tried under sections of the Explosive Act for the punishment of collecting ammunition for Yakubadhkamas and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment
 haalanki itane gunahon main mujrim qaraar die jane ke saath hi yaqub depressant kaa marij bhi ho gaya
