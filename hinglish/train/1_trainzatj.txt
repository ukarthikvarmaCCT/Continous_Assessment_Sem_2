 Despite the Election Commission's refusal, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders are unable to give up the temptation to use the Army's photo in the banner-poster
 jaipur ke bijepi saansad raamacharan bohara ne to shahar ke har gali nukkad par sena or ladaaku jahaajon ke saath khud kaa or pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tasviir laga rakhi he
 Such banner posters will be seen everywhere in Jaipur
 poster par likhaa he ki aatankiyon ko pakista main ghuskar maaraa
 In view of the Lok Sabha elections, the Election Commission has banned the political use of the army in election posters
 lekin lagata he ki saansad ji ko apana kaam ginane ko kuch mil nahin rahaa he to sena ke shaury ko hi bhunaane main jute gaye hai
 However, the MP kept clarifying when questioned
 raamacharan bohara ne kaha ki ye poster unhone chunaav ke liye nahin lagaaya he
 If the Election Commission directs, we will remove it
 vahiin bijepi saansad ke sena ke siyaasi istemaal par rajasthan sarkaar main swasthya mantri raghu sharma ne kaha ki bijepi ke liye chunaav ayog ke nirdesh kuch myne nahin rakhte hai
 These people could not do anything in five years and are now adopting such tactics to win the election
 unhone kaha ki rajasthan main vidhansabha main haar ke baad niraash bhagava party ke kaaryakartaaon main jaan foonkane ke liye bijepi ko air strike kaa sahaara lenaa pad rahaa he
 It is important to note that the Election Commission has issued advisory to the political parties to be alert
 isamen kaha gaya he ki surakshabal desh kii simaaon, kshetra or puure raajnneetik tantra ke prahari hai
 Their role in democracy is fair and non-political
 isi vajah se jaruri he ki chunaav prachaar main surakshabalon kaa zikr karte hue raajnneetik dal or rajaneta saavdhaanee baraten
 The Ministry of Defense has expressed that since the terrorist attack, the photographs of the martyred soldiers were put on the platform of many political parties
 iske baad vaayu sena ke payalat abhinandan kii photo kaa istemaal bhi chunavi postaron or soshal media campan main ho rahaa he
 Some parties had raised objections to such propaganda and also asked to complain to the Commission
 isse pehle raksha mantralay ne chunaav ayog ko 2013 main ek patra likhaa tha jisamen kaha gaya he ki raajnneetik dalon or netaaon kii ore se sena ke javaanon kii photo kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he or is par ayog dalon ko disha-nirdesh de
 MJ Akbar, the Minister of State for External Affairs, who has been facing all-round pressure amid allegations of sexual exploitation under the # metoo campaign, has said that the charge has become a viral fever without evidence, all the allegations against him are baseless
 unhone kaha ki apane upar lage in aaropon par kanoonee karrwai karenge
 Minister of State for External Affairs, Mr j Akbar, who returned from a tour of Africa on Sunday, clarified that without evidence the evidence has become a viral fever for some sections
 jo kuch bhi maamla he, ab main laut aayaa hum, mere vakil in sabhi aadhanheen aaropon ko dekhte hue aage kii karrwai karenge
 Akbar questioned why such a storm arose a few months before the Lok Sabha elections? He said that the allegations against him are wrong, fabricated and baseless and this has caused irreparable damage to his image
 akbar ne kaha ki jhooth ke paanv nahin hote, lekin usamen jehar hota he
 They will take appropriate legal action
 unhone kaha ki patrkaar priya ramani ne yah campan ek saal pehle ek patrika main lekh ke madhyam se shuru kiya tha
 She did not take my name because she knew that her story was wrong
 jab unase poocha gaya ki aapane naam kyon nahin liya tab unhone twit main likhaa, "naam kabhi nahin liya kyonki unhone kuch nahin kiya
 "akbar said if i did nothing, what is the news? But without all this speculation and abusive atmosphere is being created
 unhone kaha ki kuch aarope puri tarah se suni hui baton par aadhaarit or niraadhaar hai
 While others have said that i did nothing
 shuma rahaa ne kaha he ki ve spasht karnaa chaahati hai ki maine kuch nahin kiya
 Anju Bharti, a woman, made absurd accusations that i was partying in the swimming pool
 main tairnaa bhi nahin jaanata
 The Minister of State for External Affairs said that Ghazala Wahab made allegations to tarnish my image
 unhone daawa kiya ki maine 21 saal pehle daftar main unka yon shoshan kiya
 The only office in which i worked with Ghazala Wahab was The Asian Age office
 jisamen sampadakeey team ek chote se haul main kaam karti thi
 At that time i had a small cubicle, surrounded by a wall of plywood and glass
 is par vishwaas karnaa ajeeb he ki itane chote jagah par kuch ho or kisi ko pataa bhi na chale
 These allegations are false, motivated and baseless
 akbar ne kaha ki aaropon ke baavjood bhi ramani or wahaab mere saath kaam karti raheen, isse spasht hota he ki unhen koi dar or asuvidha nahin thi
 The reason for his remaining silent for so many years is clear
 gauratlab he ki videsh se lautne par videsh rajyamantri emje akbar ne kaha tha ki apane upar lage aaropon par ve baad main bolenge
 Let me tell you that on October 12, when Amit Shah was asked a question on this issue, he said that he will have to see whether these allegations are true or false
 amit shah ne kaha tha ki post kii satyata jaanch bhi jaruri he, jinaki ore se ye aarope lagaaye gayi hai
 MJ Akbar, a famous journalist and writer, has been the editor of many newspapers
 unke upar ab tak 11 mahila patrakaron ne # metoo abhiyaan ke tahat aarope lagaae hai
 Akbar was first accused by a senior journalist named Priya Ramani in which he told his story during an interview in a hotel room
 ramani ke aaropon ke baad akbar ke khilaaf aaropon kii baadh aa gai or ek ke baad ek kai anya mahila patrakaron ne un par sangeen aarope lagaaein
 Akbar's latest accusation was made by a foreign woman journalist that she was only 18 when she came for internship in 2007 and MJ Akbar tried to misbehave with her
 yon shoshan ke khilaaf ek saal pehle america se shuru hue # metoo abhiyaan ne bharat cinema, intertenment industry ke saath raajnneeti ko bhi apni chapet main le liya
 So far, many women related to Bollywood and entertainment industry have surfaced on social media and made public the names of the accused of sexual exploitation

 karnataka main chal rahe raajnneetik ghatnakram par endie main bijepi kii sahyogi shivasena ne jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said that the Center should appoint chief ministers like governors
 unhone kaha ki ‘ ye loktantr kaa anadar kiya ja rahaa he
 'thackeray said at a rally in Ulhasnagar,' If democracy is to be disrespected, then what is the use of saying a democratic country? Elections should be stopped so that Prime Minister Modi can go on a foreign tour without any hindrance
 ’ karnataka chunaav ko lekar thakare ke bhaajapa par ksaa tanj, kaha- chunaav kyon karavaate hai, sidhedilli se mukhyamantriniyukt kar dijieunhone kaha, 'chunaav karana band kar dijiye, taaki samay or dhan kii bachat ho sake

 Recently, Farah Khan had called Kapil Sharma 'manless' to send the invite to the screening of the film on whatsapp
 unhone twitor par gusse se bharaa twit post kiya tha
 Now Kapil Sharma has expressed his reaction in this matter
 farah ke minerles twit par kapil ne ek intervyuu main kaha, guuruuvaar ko hamaara sho tha
 The way i got it right, i had invited my friends from the film industry
 screening ko zyaadaatar cast kru, mere doston or parivaar ke logon ne atend kiya tha
 i am sure my powerful friends associated with the film world will definitely watch the movie later
 videsh main 'firangi' kii shandaar shuruyaat, kiya itane kaa collectionfirangi ke diarector rajeev dhingra bhi kapil sharma ke bachaav main aae
 He said, i do not understand why such negativity is being spread around Kapil Sharma
 unhen is tareeke se kyon treet kiya ja rahaa he
 i do not think it is right to criticize Kapil like this
 Dear Mannerless people,if u want me 2 attend ur premier / preview / party DON,T send me a “ janta invite” on whatsapp! u r not doing me a favour! The least u can do is make a personal call
 If u cant find the time for it what makes u think i hav time 2 get ready n cm for you ??! 😡😡😡— Farah Khan (@thefarahkhan) November 30, 2017, Kapil at the special screening of his film Firangi Called his friends from the film industry
 khabar ai thi ki unhone farah ko whatsap par inwite bheja tha
 To which Farah made an angry tweet
 unhone twit main un logon ko latada jo whatsap karke partiyon yaa premier main inwite karte hai
 Review: One liner is good, but quite long Kapil's 'firangi' Farah did not take any name in this tweet, but his gesture was understood towards Kapil Sharma
 haalanki baad main apane twit par farah ne kaha ki vah kapil sharma ke liye nahin tha
 2-3 more events were to be held on the same day, i was talking about them
 dharm, samskruti or bhugolic simaaon se pare 21 june ko antarrashtriya yoga diwas manaaya gaya
 On December 11, 2014, the UN began Yoga Day, a day that shaped human life
 is maukey par tivi kalakaaron ne logon ko ‘sehatmand kal’ ke liye yoga karne kaa sandesh or prerana di
 Yoga for these artists is Khasdevolina Bhattacharjee: The most important thing for yoga is practice - a steady effort that constantly takes you to the desired direction
 yani swasth jindagi kii taraf le jaae
 Yoga is very important to stay fit
 parl ve purihyog kaa matlab hota he jodna
 To increase the cosmic energy in itself, strength and beauty in body, mind and soul
 mujhe mahasoos hota he ki ham sabhi ko is par bharosa karne ke saath hi anand uthaanaa chahie or feet rahanaa chahie
 Stunning Light: a photographer asks people to pose for him
 taaki vah ek sundar photo khinch sake
 But a yoga instructor asks people to pose for themselves
 taaki yoga karne vaala sehatmand rah sake
 By doing yoga, there is a flow of fresh energy within you
 kunal jaisinghidhyaan kaa matlab hota he puri tarah se apane puure astitv ke saath sajagata se upasthit hona, is prakriya main aapke saath aapaki bechainiyaan or chunautiyaan bhi hongi
 Meditation does not mean escaping from life
 yoga hamen jindagi kii chunautiyon se ladane kii kshamta dene ke saath hi puri tarah feet rakhata he
 Helle Shah: One can get success in yoga by practicing
 haa, aalsee vyakti ke liye yah safalataa bahut dur hoti he
 Continuous practice is the key to success
 mujhe lagata he ki har umr ke vyakti ko yoga karnaa chahie
 Suyyash Raiyoga: It is not just to keep repeating some asanas
 balki jivan kii sookshm urja kaa anveshan or uski khoj he
 Shubhangi Atreha Yoga is a journey done by oneself, for oneself
 or meraa bharosa he ki har kisi ko sehatmand rahane ke liye is safar ko karne kii koshish kerani chahie
 Adnan Khan: Yoga teaches the treatment of a merge that does not need to be endured and also teaches that it cannot be treated
 yani yoga upachaar ke saath aisi rogon ko sahane kii kshamta bhi detaa he jinka puri tarah se ilaaj sambhav nahin he
 Yoga teaches to always be healthy
 mahika sharmabachpan main mere yoga ke teacher ne mujhe sikhaaya ki saans andar khinchne kaa matlab he ki ishwar se aapane takat lee or saans chhodane kaa matlab he ki aapane sansar ko kuch diya
 Enjoy yoga and stay fit
 puru chhibbarayog sangeet kii tarah he
 The rhythm of the body, the tune of the mind and the rhythm of the soul create symphony in life
 yani ek taratamyata laati he
 Trust yoga to stay fit and healthy

 baithak main mayawati ne pragatisheel samaajawaadee party (lohia) ke adhyaksh shivpal singh yadav or samaajaparty party ke adhyaksh akhilesh yadav par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 He said that Shivpal Yadav got Yadav vote transfers to BJP and SP could not stop it

 sapa 37, basapa 38 or areldi 3 siton par chunaav ladi thi, to vahiin amethi or raibareli seat par gathbandhan ne apana ummidavaar nahin utaara tha
 Although the three parties could not do anything amazing even when they came together
 lekin basapa ko pichley chunaav ke mukaable jarur phayda hua
 The BSP, which did not win a single seat in 2014, managed to win 10 seats this time
 vahiin sapa 5 seat jeetne main safal rahi
 Apart from this, not a single seat was found in rld's account
 mayawati ne kaha ki akhilesh yadav apni patni dimple yadav ko bhi chunaav nahin jita paae
 Explain that Dimple Yadav contested from Kannauj seat, where she lost
 basapa adhyaksh ne kaha ki yadav vot apeksha ke anuroop hamako transfar nahin hue
 Akhilesh Yadav could not stop the distribution of votes in this election
 sutron ke mutabik, mayawati ke is rukh ke baad sapa-basapa gathbandhan tut kii kagaar par najar aa rahaa he
 Mayawati said that the party will fight in all the assembly by-elections and now have to do politics with a target of 50 percent votes

 There was a fight between Shiv Sena and MNS over grabbing the Marathi issue
 shivasena kaa he marathi muddashivsena pramukh bal thakare kehete hai marathi mudda shivasena kaa he to raaj thakare ke bhi bol tikhe hai
 Bal Thackeray is hurt, his anger is erupting over MNS leader Raj Thackeray, who was separated from Shiv Sena for trying to snatch the Marathi issue from Shiv Sena
 bal thakare tabiyat bigadane kii vajah se chunavi sabhaayen nahin kar sakate lekin chunaav ne dastak di he to khud apana intervyuu record kar marathi mudda hathiyaane kii jugat bhida rahe hai
 Raj again reiterated that old Ragbal Thackeray is trying to convince the public that the Marathi issue is Shiv Sena's legacy, he does not have the right of MNS but where Raj Thackeray believes so easily
 idhar bal thakare kaa dard saamne aayaa udhar raaj thakare ne marathi auki uttar bhartiya kaa purana raag phir doharaa diya
 The fight over issues is the practice of politics, but the fight for the issue is started by Shiv Sena and MNS

 mahadevan) on Sep 21, 2018 at 11:43pm PDT In Congress these days, the cycle of following and unfollowing on Twitter is continuously gaining headlines
 kya netaa, kya kaaryakarta or kya patrkaar sabhi ke bich charchaa isi baat kii he ki, twitor kii is siyasat main kitna sach he
 Firstly while in Congress, Gujarat leader Shankar Singh Vaghela unfollowed Rahul Gandhi on Twitter, since then there has been an indication that, now Vaghela is moving away from the Congress
 baad main aisa hua bhi
 This was followed by former Finance Minister P
P
 chidambaram kaa, jo twitor par sirf paanch logon ko follow karte the, khaas baat ye thi ki, usamen rahul gandhi shaamil nahin the, jabaki, ulte rahul gandhi khud chidambaram ko follow karte rahe hai
 However, as the discussion intensified, Chidambaram recently started following Rahul Gandhi on Twitter
 chidambaram kii taraf se safai bhi ai ki, wo khud apana twitor handle nahin chalaate, isliye follow or anfolo karne kaa sawaal nahin
 Now in the meantime, the latest case came from former Union Minister Kapil Sibal
 achaanak sibbal ke twitor handle ne rahul gandhi ko anfolo kar diya
 The Congress corridors were stirred up after the Vaghela controversy
 congress kaa soshal media vibhaag pareshaan ho gaya ki, wo soshal media par viral ho rahi is khabar kaa kya jawaab de
 Finally, when this issue was discussed with Sibal, Sibal said, why would he do this? iske baad sibbal ne apane staff se baatcheet karke bataaya ki, unka staff ai pad thik karaane gaya tha, usee main galati se aisa hua, rahul ke saath hi kai or log dhokhe se anfolo ho gaye
 After this, the leaders of the party and social media came to life
 phir sibbal ne fouran offis of arji yani rahul ko dobaaraa follow kar liya
 Interestingly, Chidambaram has started following Rahul only after Sibal's case arose
 lekin twitor kii kahani yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 The Twitter handle of the name of Jairam Ramesh, who has been accused of behaving like a sultan even after the sultanate on Congress leaders recently, is now a matter of discussion
 rahul gandhi ke kareebi maane jane vaale jairam ramesh ke naam kaa twitor account sirf chaar logon ko twitor par follow karata he, jisamen rahul gandhi nahin hai
 On this, Congressmen say to the tongue, that who should not follow their leader, in fact he is the Sultan
 lekin ajtak ne is bare main jab jairam ramesh se ajtak ne poocha to unhone saaf jawaab diya ki, wo twitor par nahin hai, unka koi twitor account nahin he, na wo twit kar sakate hai or na hi retweet
 Heijaram also said that he has no intention of coming on Twitter any further
 darasal, jairam ramesh ke naam se chal rahaa twitor account veryphid nahin he, lekin jairam virodhiyon ne ise hi jairam se chutki lene kaa hathiyaar bana liya
 Overall, the Congress' interesting Twitter saga continues
 kejariwal sarkaar main mantriyon kii videsh yatraaon par hua kharch rahasy ban gaya he
 BJP MLA OP Sharma asked a question in the Assembly as to why the government was not disclosing the expenditure incurred on foreign visits of ministers and mlas
 is bich, sarkaar 5 maheene pehle die jawaab par kaayam he ki jaankaree abhi bhi jutai ja rahi he
 The monsoon session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly is going on and in this session once again questions were asked about foreign visits involving ministers and mlas
 lekin jawaab naa tab yani march maheene main mil paaya tha or naa hi ab mil paaya he
 Actually, BJP MLA from Vishwas Nagar Om Prakash Sharma had sought information from the government regarding foreign visits of ministers and mlas
 lekin iske jawaab main likhaa gaya ki dilli sarkaar ke vibhinn vibhaagon se videsh daure ke bare main soochna ekatrit kii ja rahi he
 It was also said that after the information is collected, it will be laid on the Table of the House
 is puure maamle main hairaani kii baat ye rahi ki kuch esa hi sawaal jab paanch maheene pehle march 2018 main vidhansabha satr ke dauraan model toun se aap vidhayak akhilesh pati treepathi ne poocha tha
 Even then the answer was given something similar
 us samay kaha gaya ki jaankaree abhi jutai ja rahi he
 Now the question arises whether even after 5 months the government does not have the answer to how many ministers and legislators have traveled abroad and how much did they cost
 is puure maamle par bijepi vidhayak om prakaash sharma ne sarkaar par gambhir sawaal khadey kiye
 He said that the government is deliberately trying to hide the information
 is bichaap vidhayankhilesh pati treepathi ne iskaa jimmedaar adhikariyon ko tehraaya
 The MLA from Model Town said that the officials do not want to answer any question properly
 jaahir he is bich sawaal ye nahin ki jawaab aakhir kisne nahin diya, sarkaar ne yaa adhikari ne
 When ministers and legislators travel abroad on people's tax money, people should get information about this expenditure, which is the responsibility of the government, but at present, the government seems to be trying to hide this information
 congress ke varisht vidhayak evam purv mantri da
 Govind Singh has accused Shivraj Singh Chauhansarkar of Madhya Pradesh by misleading the people of the state on the basis of false data by publishing advertisements of 'madhya Pradesh is now the fastest growing state of the state'
 da
 Singh has strongly refuted the state government's claim that Madhya Pradesh government is number-1 in terms of development
 unhone kaha ki sakal gharelu utpaada ke maamle main madhyapradesh desh main 6wein sthaan par he
 He has also challenged to debate with the Chief Minister of the state on any platform in this regard
 da
 Singh has released the letter written by Sindhu Khullar, Secretary, Planning Commission, Government of India to the Chief Secretary of the state and revealed the actual figures
 da
 Singh said that this letter of the Planning Commission is showing a mirror to the state government on the one hand and on the other hand is also revealing all the claims of the government
 ukt patr pradesh ke pichhadepan ko ujagar kar rahaa he
 He said that it has been clearly stated in this letter that the state ranks 23rd in the country in terms of per capita income

 The Congress Parliamentary Party met on Tuesday amid the monsoon session of Parliament
 rahul gandhi ke congress adhyaksh banane ke baad congress kii ye pehali sansadeey dal kii baithak thi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi was targeted at Rahul Gandhi while addressing the meeting
 rahul ne apane sabhi saansadon se 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye taiyaar hone ko kaha
 Rahul said that the Prime Minister is silent on all matters related to corruption, Rafael is a big scam
 unhone kaha ki ham apni ladaai jari rakhenge
 He said that Congress mps have fought a good fight in the last four years on the issue of farmers and employment
 ye saal hamaare liye mushkilon bhare rahe hai
 We will contest the government in the same way, in 2019, the Congress will definitely win a big victory
 sansadeey dal ko sambodhit karte hue rahul ne teen muddon par jor diya
 He asked to surround the Modi government on the issue of Rafale, farmers and employment
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri ko bolne kii jarurat he, lekin wo chuppi saadhe baithe hai
 It was because of the aggressive rhetoric of Kirahul that the BJP was on the backfoot these days
 haal hi main SC / ST act or maratha aarakshan jaise mudde par baikfoot par khadi bhartiya janata party ke liye kendriya mantri nitin gadakari kaa bayaan mushkilen lekar aayaa
 On Monday, Rahul Gandhi also took a dig at the Union Minister over the issue
 darasal, gadakari ne kaha tha ki aakhir logon ko aarakshan kyon chahie jab desh main naukari hi nahin hai
 On this, Rahul taunted that Gadkari, you have asked the right question
 har bhartiya ye hi sawaal puch rahaa he
 Where are the jobs? pakistan main pradhanmantri navaj sharif kii sarkaar ke pradarshnakariyon ke saath gatirodh ke kaaran bane desh ke maujuuda raajnneetik halaat par desh kii shaktishaalee sena ne aaj gambhir chintaa jataai
 The Corps Commander's Conference of top military officers was held at the military headquarters in Rawalpindi

 'the army warned that further use of forces would only exacerbate the problem
 varsh 1947 ke baad se aadhe se zyada samay tak pakistan par shashan karne vaali sena ke adhikariyon ne kaha ki bina samay ganvaae halaat se raajnneetik tareeke se nipatna chahie or hinsak tareeke nahin apanaaye jane chahie
 Striving to remain neutral in the ongoing campaign against Prime Minister Sharif, led by Imran Khan and Tahir ul Qadri, the army said that it is committed to fulfill its responsibility of protecting the country and will not miss to fulfill national aspirations
 
 somvaar kii jagah aaj hui baithak main raajnneetik netritv ko spasht sandesh diya gaya ki sena loktantr or desh ke saath he, kisi vyakti ke saath nahin
 The army has indicated that it will not interfere in the defense of Prime Minister Sharif, who is waging a fight against two staunch opponents
 is bayaan main pradhanmantri dwaara raajnneetik sankat se nipatane ke tareeke or khaastaur par bal ke istemaal kaa samarthan nahin kiya gaya he
 In fact, the statement talks about a policy that leaves the option of military intervention open when the situation is out of control

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav did not finally come to Noida this time too
 akhilesh ko usee totake kaa dar sata rahaa he jiske chalate pehle bhi tamaam mukhyamantri noida aane se kataraate rahe
 However, this time Akhilesh promised that if his government is formed in 2017, he will definitely come to Noida
 lekin siem apane vaade par kitna kaayam rahete hai, yah aane vaala vakt hi batayega
 Because in the last month i
e
 November, CM Akhilesh Yadav promised to come to Noida and lay the foundation stone of all the projects
 buudhvaar ko siem akhilesh yadav ne noida, greater noida, yamuna expresve audyogic vikaas praadhikaran or noida metro rail corporation limited kii ahm pariyojnaon samet 11 projects ko hari jhandi dikhaai
 CM chose a place for this 5, Kalidas Marg, Lucknow i
e
 Chief Minister's residence
 vaise to shuru se hi is baat ko lekar sanshay tha ki siem in pariyojnaon kaa locarpan karne noida aaenge yaa nahin
 The reason for this was the current superstition in the political corridor about Noida
 haalanki beete 2 disambar ko nai dilli main kaarykram main shirkat karne aae siem akhilesh ne noida ke totake vaale sawaal par tahaakaa lagaaya or kaha ki wo jald hi noida kaa daura karne vaale hai
 In such a situation, it was expected that CM would come to Noida to give green signal to these projects
 us vakt yah kaarykram 11 disambar ko hona prastaavit tha
 When or when CM Akhilesh did not come for the first time with Akhilesh Yadav, who has been in the chair of CM for more than four years, he postponed his visit to Noida
 30 november, 2016: siem akhilesh ne yamuna expresve audyogic vikaas praadhikaran kshetra main sthapit kiye ja rahe patanjali food and herbal park privet limited noida kaa shilanyas kiya
 CM did not come to Noida for this, but inaugurated it from Lucknow itself
 22 agast, 2016: akhilesh yadav ne lakhanu sthit apane sarkari awaas se hi noida sthit benit uniwarsity kaa udghaatan kiya
 April 20, 2016: Akhilesh Yadav did not come to attend the event of President Pranab Mukherjee in Greater Noida

 April 5, 2016: Akhilesh Yadav did not attend PM Modi's program 'stand Up India' in Sector 62 of Noida
 31 disambar, 2015: noida main dilli-meerut express ke udghaatan maukey par siem akhilesh nahin aae
 The chief guest of that event was PM Narendra Modi
 siem akhilesh yadav ne pradesh sarkaar ke pratinidhi ke taur par mantri kailash yadav ko us kaarykram main shariq hone ke liye bheja tha
 October 4, 2015: Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav met the family members of Akhlaq who were killed after rumor of beef in Bisahara village of Dadri area of noida at their government residence in Lucknow, but despite such a big incident, they did not come to Noida
 2 april, 2013: siem ne gautam buddha nagar main tamaam pariyojnaon kaa udghaatan kiya lekin noida nahin aae
 August 2012: Akhilesh Yadav inaugurated the Yamuna Expressway from Lucknow and did not come to Noida
 kya he noida kaa totakauttar pradesh ke siyaasi galiyare main aisi manyata he ki soobe kaa siem agar noida kaa daura karata he to jald hi use kursi se bedakhal hona padataa he
 This trick has been going on for more than two decades
 is totake kii vajah se soobe ke mukhyamantri noida aane se kataraate hai
 This vengeance began in 1988 when the then CM Vir Bahadur Singh lost power within a few days of the Noida tour
 1989 main endi tiwari, 1995 or 1999 main kalyaan singh ke saath bhi aisa hua tha
 Mulayam Singh Yadav went to Noida as CM in 1995 and was ousted from power within a few months
 1999 main ram prakaash gupta ke saath bhi aisa hua tha
 In 1997, Mayawati also went to Noida as CM after which she was ousted from power
 mayawati ne ek baar phir noida aane kaa saahas kiya or oktober 2011 main dalit prerana sthal kaa udghaatan kiya lekin agle saal hue chunaav main unki party satta se baahar ho gai

 Many relationships are very liked in the beginning but as time goes by, the sweetness in the relationship starts to decrease

 If the relationship becomes a burden for you, then it is better to end such a relationship

 Although maybe one or two days the partner's mood is not good, but if this is happening continuously then it is better to end the relationship

 Low self-esteem - respect for each other is very important in the relationship

 In the new policy, measures will be taken to promote PRTC and Punjab Roadways by eliminating the monopoly of private bus operators
 hoicourt ke adeshon ke anusaar nai niti 15 may, 2017 tak taiyaar kar lee jaaegi
 This will affect 750 private bus route permits, increase of 1840 original routes of 24 km and permits of 6700 mini buses

 Sometimes American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, who is famous with sex tapes, is not coming to India
 isse pehle film interstailor ke diarector christopher nolan ke mumbai aane kii afvaah udi thi
 But he refused

 But even bigger shock was that most TV channels and newspapers did not give much importance to this biggest news of that day
 iske bajaay ve kisi sinha or kisi sant kii khabaron main uljhe rahe
 What was Ranjit done
 bas supreme court se ek farmaan hi to aayaa tha uske liye

 jo log badi tivi kharid sakate hai, unamem se bhi zyaadaatar aisa nahin karte
 Because to do this, you will need a room in the house
 jo ek taraf se 42 inch se zyada bada ho
 This allows the small screen to absorb Kim's size

 koi kim vim nahin
 Because in the end the government will give all the compensation
 isliye santon, asanton, ghonghabasanton, kisi vija vagairah ko kim ke na aane kii vajah mat bataaie
 Firstly, no one will believe that Kim cannot get a visa, second, if she does not get a visa, she can use the master card
 yah kahata bhi he ki har cheez ke liye kar sakate hai hamaara istemaal
 And yes

 co / mtfesbv0vrkemxriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki jaanch main mishael ne 'misses gandhi' ji kaa naam liya he
 It is mentioned 'son of Italian Lady'
 'aar' ye ullekh kiya he
 'big man' is mentioned
 'party leader' ye ullekh kiya he
 Earlier, we only knew two words
 'family' or 'egeem'
 Now a new reveal was revealed
 sabhi ek hi parivaar ke taraf ishaara karata he
 Our biggest issue is that the Congress government was a government of scams
 desh ke suraksha ke saath samjhauta karke sirf ghotaalaa kiya gaya
 Water, land, sky were scams everywhere
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki vah raaj aisa tha, jisamen desh ko luutane kaa kaam hua
 Meanwhile, the 'accidental Prime Minister' continued to rule during the loot raj
 unhone kaha ki kol scam main manmohan singh bechaara or besahaara bane rahe, kyonki unke paas chitthee aati thi
 Javadekar said that as soon as Mitchell was brought to India, the Congress immediately gave him a lawyer
 isse uskaa raaj ujagar ho gaya he
 He said that Rahul Gandhi repeatedly mentions HAL, which is revealed today how HAL was sidelined
 ye lagaataar khulaase saamne aa rahe hai, isliye hamen samaj main aa rahaa he chor itnaa shor kyon machaa rahaa he? yahi kahani he
 Thieves made noise ' unhone kaha ki bhrashtachar ke cese main maa-bete donon bel par hai
 This is all going towards the same family
 isi kii chori pakadi ja rahi he
 The Congress was a government of scandals
 ab lut kii kahani saamne aa rahi he
 Please tell that ED said that they use code for conversation
 kahaan-kahaan meeting karte the, ab yah pataa karnaa he
 Also, which officials we used to meet are also to be found out
 mani trail kaa bhi pataa lagaana he
 The ED sought an 8-day remand of middleman Christian Michel
 iske baad mishael ko 7 din kii idi kii remand par bhej diya gaya he
 On the other hand, reversing the case, the Congress said, "there is pressure on middleman Christian Michel to name one 'one family'"
 congress netaa arpyen singh ne kaha ki aakhir kyon chaukeedaar sarkari agenciyon par ek parivaar kaa naam lene kaa dabaav bana rahe hai
 BJP script writers seem to be working overtime
 idi ke anusaar krishchayan mishael ne identifai kiya he ki kis tarah deal se HAL ko baahar nikaalkar tata ko dilwaai ja rahi thi
 Michelle took the name of 'mrs Gandhi' 2 days ago in the interrogation
 haalanki kis reference main ye naam liya he, bataa nahin sakate hai
 His lawyer was given a paper by Michel (christian Michel) during the handshake
 jisko baad main dekha gaya to us par misses gandhi se related puche gaye sawaal likhe the
 That is, let's talk in code and decode that code
 pakistan ke sindh praant main instant miseging or internet telephoni sevaaon par teen maheene ke liye bain laga diya gaya he
 These include the popular message application 'whatsapp', video calling application 'skype' and audio calling app 'viber'
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki suraksha kaarnon se yah faisla liya gaya he
 However, the province's information minister, Sharjeel Memon, did not say what the security system would benefit from the ban
 lekin raksha sevaaon kaa maananaa he ki aatankwaadi bade paimaane par instant miseging or internet telephoni kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 Significantly, not only the Taliban militants, but also the mafia-like leaders have a great influence in Karachi, the capital of Sindh
 yahaan bade paimaane par apharan, supaari kiling or duusare gaiyr-kanoonee dhandhe fal-phool rahe hai
 It is not yet clear whether the other three provinces of Pakistan will also implement this ban
 saath hi abhi is par bhi sanshay he ki yah pratibandh vyaavhaarik rup se kitna lagu ho paaegaa
 Sana Salim, the co-founder of 'bolo Bhi', an organization working for the freedom of Internet in Pakistan, has said that any attempt to ban Skype would be illegal
 unhone kaha, 'sarkaar kanoon-vyavastha banane or dikkatein sulajhane main naakaam ho chuki he or ab yah dikhaanaa chaahati he ki vah sakhti se kadam uthaa rahi he
 Sadly, the government is taking away their fundamental rights from the people

 sabase bade faisle kii taarikh tay ho chuki he
 a decision is to come on November 25 on the aarushi-hemraj murder case
 sab yah jaanane ko betaab hai ki aakhir aarushi-hemraj kaa kaatil koun he
 This is perhaps the first such case in recent times, whose decision is to be told completely and only after hearing the story and circumstantial evidence
 is dabl murder main aaj tak naa to koi sidhaa gavaah saamne aayaa he, naa pukhta saboot mili hai, naa aalaa-e-katl he or naa hi katl kii vajah ko sabit karne vaala koi thos saboot
 Now, in such a case, the plea of CBI lawyer, scientific evidence and just to keep the situation in front is to decide the murderer
 jaahir he kaatil ke taur sibiai ne kisi or ko nahin balki aarushi ke maa-baap yani doctor rajesh or doctor nupur talwaar ko hi katghare main khadaa kiya he or sajeesh kii sari kahani inhen donon ke ird-gird gumti he
 The reason for encircling these two was also stated
 vajah ye ki 15-16 may 2008 kii raat jab aarushi or hemraj kaa katl hua to ghar ke andar sirf chaar log the
 Dr
 Rajesh Talwar, Dr
 Nupur Talwar, Aarushi and Hemraj
 sibiai kii puri kahani yahi kahati he ki us raat ghar ke andar se koi baahar nahin gaya or baahar se koi andar nahin aayaa
 That is, the murder took place inside the house and the killer was in the house
 isi kahani ko lekar sibiai ne adaalat main apni tamaam daleelein or scientific saboot rakhe
 However, let us tell you that it is the same CBI that recommended to close the case in December 2010
 sibiai ne tab baqayada adaalat main closer report laga di thi, is daleel ke saath ki doctor rajesh talwaar or nupur talwaar ko lekar use shaq to he par unke khilaaf koi saboot nahin he, lekin phir farvari 2011 main adaalat ne closer report ko khaarij kar usee closer reporter ko chargeshit main badal dene kaa hukum diya tha
 After this, on 25 May 2012, the charge sheet against the Talwar couple was framed and Mudkadame action started by making them accused
 kareeb dedh saal mukademe kii karrwai chali
 On the one hand, the CBI lawyers are holding the Talwar couple murderer, on the other hand they themselves are confused about some questions
 in sawaalon ke jawaab main sibiai ne tamaam daleelein to adaalat ke saamne pesh kin par saboot nahin
 All these evidences or arguments have been kept in the court on behalf of the CBI: Proof No
 1 doctors Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar locked the room of Aarushi from outside every night and kept the key under her pillow, while on May 16, the key at around twelve in the afternoon Found lying in the lobby
 chaabi vahaan kaise pahunchi iskaa jawaab talwaar dampatti nahin de paae
 Everything was cleared on proof number-2 chance-a-crime
 aarushi kii laash ko chadar se dhakaa gaya or jagah-jagah khun ke chhinton ko poncha gaya
 Only those at home can do this work
 saboot number-316 may kii subah aarushi ke katl kii khabar milane par jaise hi police ghar pahunchi ghar waalon ne police kaa dhyaan baantne ke liye unhen hemraj ko talash karne baahar bhej diya
 Dr
 Talwar refused to give the key to the roof even after the evidence number 4 showed blood marks on the roof door and latch
 saboot number-5hemraj kii laash chat par paae jane ke baad doctor talwaar ne uski shinaakht karne se manaa kar diya
 Dr
 Dinesh Talwar pleaded not to mention the rape in the evidence number-6 post mortem report and FIR
 saboot number-7purv police adhikari keke gautam ke bayaan or kol ditelske mutabik hemraj kii laash chat par ittefaq se nahin mila, balki laash talashne ke liye vahaan inhen khaastaur parabhijawaya gaya tha
 Proof No
 8 Golf Stick, suspected to have been slaughtered by him and who had been missing from the house since the incident, even after being found by Dr
 Talwar did not inform anyone for a year
 saboot number-9saboot auki halaat yahi kah rahe the ki qatl golf stick se hua or kaatil ne achaanak gusse main uskaa istemaal kiya he or yo golf stick doctor talwaar istemaal karte the
 Proof number-10, a day before the post-mortem, Dr
 Rajesh Talwar's brother, Dr
 Dinesh Talwar asked one of his fellow doctors, Sunil Doher, to call himself as Dr
 Dogra, head doctor of the aiims-forensic Department
 ye sabit karata he ki aisa isliye kiya gaya taaki postmortem report apane hisaab se banwaaya ja sake
 It is to be seen now that like the defense, the court considers or rejects these arguments of the CBI

 Along with this, frequent advertisements on TV are also presenting gender equality as a positive norm

 Senior BJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi has said today by tweeting that Narendra Modi's second phase campaign in Bihar will start from March 3
 baad main susheel kumaar modi ne narendra modi ke mujffarpur jila aane se jude kaarykram ke praapt hone kii pushti kii
 This rally of Narendra Modi to be held in Muzaffarpur, the major city of North Bihar, will be the second rally after the Hunkar rally held on October 27 last year at Gandhi Maidan in Patna
 gandhi maidan main yojit bhaajapa kii raily main narendra modi ke sambodhan ke purv vahaan hue chah silsilewar dhamaake main chah logon kii maut ho gai thi
 On November 2, Modi again came to Bihar to console the families of those who died in these blasts 
 narendra modi kii dharmanirpekshita ko lekar sawaal uthaane vaali bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii party jadyu ne unhen chunaav abhiyaan samiti kaa pramukh banaae jane par pichley saal june main bhaajapa se naata tod liya tha
 The Aam Aadmi Party is going through an apology these days
 dilli se lekar punjab tak chunavi reliyon main sakhti se virodhiyon par nishaanaa saadhane vaale arvind kejariwal in dinon naram padate nazar aa rahe hai
 After joining politics, many leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party are facing defamation cases
 arvind kejariwal ne punjab ke purv mantri bikram majithia, maujuuda kendriya mantri nitin gadakari auchhamit sibbalase likhit maafee maangi he
 The decision has surprised the party's internal leaders as well as outsiders
 pichley saal bhi arvind kejariwal ne bijepi ke purv saansad avatar singh bhadaana se maafee maangi thi
 He even went so far as to misguide his colleague and make false allegations
 ab kya inase maafee maangenge kejariwal?- 2013 main shila dikshit ke raajnneetik sachiv pawan kheda ne kejariwal par cese kiya tha
 She then made vulgar remarks on Sheela during the television show and performance
 - arun jetali ne kejariwal par manahani ke 2 cese kiye hai
 First, a case of Rs 10 crore for corruption charges in DDCA, and a case for dragging Jaitley's name in a raid on the Chief Minister's Office
 - 2013 main surendra kumaar sharma ne un par cese kiya tha
 Surendra had filed a defamation case against Kejriwal on charges of not giving tickets to AAP and indecent remarks against him
 - 2016 main bijepi saansad ramesh bidhudi ne apane khilaaf aadharahin aarope lagane ke liye kejariwal par manahani kaa cese kiya
 - In 2016, Chetan Chauhan filed a defamation case against Kejriwal after the indecent remarks against him in the DDCA case
 kya ye hai maafeename kii asal vajah?1
 The organization's concern may be CM Kejriwal's special strategy
 netritv ne faisla liya he ki sabhi netaaon par chal rahemanhani ke mukademonko jaise-taise khatm kiya jaae
 Even if we have to apologize for this, they are ready
 manahani ke mukademon kii vajah se ‘aap’ netaa party ke vistaar par dhyaan nahin de paa rahe hai
 Organization has to be increased in many states
 agle saal 2019 main loksabhaa ke chunaav hone hai
 2
 khatre main party kaa bhavishyamanahani ke maamalon main paryaapt saboot na pesh kar paane kii sthiti main yaa to baari bharkam harjaana dena padegaa yaa jail janaa hoga
 Aam Aadmi Party has made Nerwind Kejriwal the face across the country and in such a situation, when Arvind Kejriwal himself gets caught in the trouble of defamation case, the future of the party which is constantly falling apart may be in danger
 3
 Shortage of funds: a question also arises whether the AAP has reduced its donations or the party does not have enough money to contest the defamation case
 court cese main vakil apane manmutabik fees lete hai
 Money is also being lost over time due to dates
 jaahir he 2019 ke chunaav prachaar main dhan kii jarurat hogi
 In Shirur, Pune, laborers working on the farm found three small leopard children
 vakya 16 november kaa he jab pune main shirur ke paas vadgaanv main majdoor khet main ganne kii kataai kar rahe the tab unhen teenon bachche vahaan dikhe
 The workers informed the owner of the farm
 bachche tendue ke the isliye turant van vibhaag ko suchit kiya gaya
 After preliminary examination of the children, the forest department decided to keep them in the field at night also when they found them healthy
 unhen andeshaa tha ki maadaa tendua aasapaas main shikaar ke liye gai hogi or wo bacchon ke paas jarur lautegi
 The same happened, the next day the children did not meet there
 maadaa tendua teenon ko lekar ja chuki thi

 Ritesh wrote on Twitter "bangistan was banned by Pa Kistan, United Arab Emirates banned, now i know that it can be banned in Singapore too
 kya in deshon ke sensor board mujhe likhit main de sakate hai kii unhone hamaari film main kya bura dekha he
 i wonder how a good message is being misinterpreted
 " # Bangistan banned in # pakistan # UAE I’m now told may be # Singapore as well
 Can the censor boards in these countries give us a written 1 / 2 — Ritesh Sidhwani (@ritesh_sid) August 5, 2015 Pakistan was the first to ban 'bangistan', in which they said that the name Bangistan is similar to Pakistan
 film main north bangistan naam kaa ek ilaaka bataaya gaya he jo north pakistan se mail khaataa he
 Explanation clearly specifying what did they find offensive in our film
 
 I'm Shocked as to how they have missed the message in # Bangistan — Ritesh Sidhwani (@ritesh_sid) August 5, 2015 In response to this, Ritesh Sidhwani had said that the film 'bangistan' is giving a message against terrorism in laughter jokes which bothers Pakistan more than India and its story or any names are fictitious
 film ke naam bangistan se pakistan ko aitaraaz nahin hona chahie kyonki bangistan afghanistan se bhi miltaa julata ho saktaa he
 North Bangladesh also matches North Afghanistan, so Pakistan's objection to the film based on the name is not correct
 # Bangistan banned in # pakistan # UAE I’m now told may be # Singapore as well
 Can the censor boards in these countries give us a written 1 / 2explanation clearly specifying what did they find offensive in our film
 
 I'm Shocked as to how they have missed the message in # Bangistan north bangistan north afghanistan se bhi mail khaataa he , isliye naam ke aadhaar par pakistan kaa film par aitaraaz sahi nahin he

 jiske tahat dhai saal bijepi kaa or dhai saal shivasena kaa mukhyamantri rahegaa
 But BJP is not agreeing on this proposal of Shiv Sena

 sunanda pushkar kii postmortem report ko lekar rahasy or gaharaa gaya he
 According to sources, there is no evidence of any poison in Sunanda's body, nor any drug of depression
 2
 An earlier post-mortem report stated that Sunanda died of a drug and evidence of a drug called Elprox was found
 visra report march 2014 main ai thi
 The new disclosure is bound to raise suspicion about the post mortem
 3
 This new revelation is also in the scrutiny of the investigating officer, who found a nearly empty strip of Alprax from Sunanda's hotel room
 agar visra report sahi he, to ye mana jayega ki sunanda ne dawaai kii sahi khuraaq lee thi or alprex kii khaali strip jaanch adhikariyon ko gumraah karne ke liye rakhi gai thi
 4
 police ne sunanda ke kamare se alprex kii do strip baraamad kii thi
 a strip contains 15 bullets
 ek strip bilkul khaali thi or duusari main teen goliyaan bachi thim
 5
 abhi sawaal bada sawaal yahi uthaa haraa he ki agar sananda khuraaq ke mutabik goliyaan le rahi thim, to khaali strip kaise mili?6
 The post-mortem report also states that Sunanda had 15 wounds on her body
 7
 Most of the wounds on Sunanda's body were of a very common type, which could not lead to death
 8
 The wound number-12 was the bite of a tooth
 9
 The mark number was of -10 injections

 Sudhir Gupta, head of the forensic department of AIIMS, wrote that there was a smell of smelly gas from the body during the post-mortem

 log aapse judane main khushi mahasoos karte hon
 People recognize you by watching you on television
 aap apane pasandida kaam ko karne main khushi mahasoos karte hon or ek din achaanak hi sab-kuch ulat jaae
 You become a victim of such an accident that your movement will become very difficult
 jis chehre par aap gumaan karte hon wo is kadar vikrut ho jaae ki aap apane hi chehre se nafrat karne lagen
 This is the story of Hyderabad-based entrepreneur Ruchika Sharma
 saal 2004 main vah 9 tivi channelon par kukri sho host karti thim
 The road accident changed the whole picture
 
 
 ek din unki khushnuma jindagi main kisi kii najar lag gai
 Ruchika was hit by a terrible road accident
 is durghatana main unke haath-paanv kii haddiyaan tuutane ke saath-saath unka cheharaa bhi vikrut ho gaya
 Walking four steps for Ruchika, who always smiles, also became difficult
 logon ke liye swaadisht khaadya padaarthon kii nai-nai variety banane vaali ruchika kii jindagi bed or wheel chair tak simat gai
 She did not tolerate this condition of her own and she became a victim of depression
 maa kii himmat or facial yoga ne kiya kamaal
 
 
 Ruchika had surrendered completely after this accident, but her mother did not give up
 unki maa unhen prerak kahaniyaan sunaaya karatin
 i tried to connect with meditation and spirituality
 sadak haadase se ubarne ke liye unhen kai oparation karwaane pade
 Even the screw had to be implanted in the foot
 ruchika ne isi dauraan facial yoga kaa sahaara liya
 Yoga helped him a lot and the lost face rose again
 bachapan ke sapane ko phir se puraa karne kii koshish kii
 
 
 Ruchika wanted to become a model since childhood, but as has been the case with most of the general public of India, she too compromised with her dreams
 unke aise sapane puure nahin ho sake the lekin is ubhaar ke baad unhone thaan liya tha ki haadase se ubharne ke baad wo saundarya pratiyogita main hissaa lengi
 One day she was just browsing the internet that she came to know about Mrs
 India
 unhone fouran iske liye aavedan kar diya
 She also got selected
 yahaan vah is pratiyogita main sabase bada khitaab to nahin jeet sakin lekin unkehunar-jazbeor khubsuurati kii vajah se misses india -popular ke khitaab se nawaja gaya
 Apart from this, she has also won the titles of 'mrs
 India Hyderabad International' and 'mrs
 South Asia'
 hospital ke bed se ginis book tak kaa safar kiya tay
 
 
 After the accident, she lay on the bed of the hospital for a long time
 asahaay or hataash lekin vahaan se ek baar uthne ke baad unhone palat kar nahin dekha
 She is now a self-sufficient woman and also earns by running a cooking school for housewives
 itnaa hi nahin ruchika ne facial yoga main bhi kamaal kar dikhaaya
 After the accident, he took up the task of teaching facial yoga to others and others
 unki ek class main to 1961 log shaamil rahe or isi vajah se unka naam aaj ginis book of world record main bhi darj he
 Also, Ruchika says that yoga-meditation is a creation of India but most of its patents and records are in the name of other countries
 ruchika ne is record ko apane naam kar bharat ko garv kaa ek or mauka diya he
 His success mantra for all such people is 'never Give Up'
 ab ham to ishwar se bas yahi prarthana karenge ki ruchika yun hi aage badhati rahen

 Here the BJP in Borivali, Dahisar, Kandivali East and Charkop, Shiv Sena in Magathane has only one seat in the account of Malad West Congress

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter dilli se kareeb 6700 kilometre dur landan main hui haikar kii press conferes ne desh kii raajnneeti main nayaa bhuuchaal laa diya he
 While Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad called the hacker's press conference a Congress-sponsored circus, the Congress demanded an inquiry into the hacker's claims
 is bich EVM banane vaali company ECIL ne kaha he ki saiyad shuja naam kaa koi shaks kabhi iviem digining team kaa hissaa nahin rahaa
 At the same time, that college also rejected Shuja's claim that no student of this name studied in his college
 idhar chunaav ayog ne dilli police main hacothan ke aayojakon ke khilaaf shikaayat darj kara di he
 The college rejected the hacker's claim, in this case the principal of Shadan College of Engineering and Technology, Dr
 atik kaa kahana he ki 1995 se 2002 tak kaa college kaa record check kiya gaya he
 It does not name any student named Syed Haider Ahmed
 student ke mata-pita kaa naam bhi check kiya gaya, lekin record nahin mila
 The college is investigating the claims of Syed Shuja alias Syed Haider Ahmed
 unase kaha gaya he ki agar unhone kisi aise college se padhai kii he jo shaadaan college kaa hissaa he to uski detail bhejein
 The college said that if they send the document then we will examine it, but at present no such record exists
 ECIL ne kaha- shuja kabhi digining team main nahin rahaalandan main iviem ko hack karne kaa daawa karne vaale syed shuja ke daawey ko EVM banane vaali company ECIL (electonic corposhan of india limited) ne bhi nakaar diya he
 The company cited its record as saying that no person with this name has ever been part of the designing team
 gauratlab he ki ECIL main takreeban do hajaar karmchaaree hai
 80 percent of these engineers are working on evms only
 ECIL main is naam kaa koi bhi karmchaaree nahin mila jo baad main america shift ho gaya ho
 ECI said - EVM and safe from VVPAT
 In this case, Chief Election Commissioner SY Qureshi said that like all people, i was also keen on that PC, but the hacker could not prove any of his claims
 kuraishi ne kaha ki iviem banane main ek puri technical team thi, jisamen iaiti ke paanch professor bhi shaamil the
 In this case, to say that evms can be hacked is completely wrong
 kuraishi ne kaha ki mujhe bhi aayojakon ne nimantran bheja tha, lekin maine jane se inkaar kar diya, kyonki mujhe agle saptaah janaa he
 Qureshi said that evms are constantly updated
 VVPAT isi apadation kaa ek hissaa he, jisase yah or adhik surakshit ho gaya he
 Congress gains power from hacker claim: American hacker claim gives new strength to parties opposing EVM
 congress pravaktaa anand sharma ne kaha he ki ve chaahate hai ki 50 fisadi VVPAT kii ginati ho
 We still stand on the matter of election from ballot
 unhone kaha ki modi sarkaar kii ulti ginati shuru ho gai he
 Their defeat is certain
 koun he bhartiya mul kaa haikar saiyad shujabhartiya mul kaa saiyad shuja khud ko sibar export bataata he
 He is currently living in America
 khud ko iviem digining team kaa hissaa bataane vaale saiyad shuja kaa daawa he ki iviem ko hack kiya ja saktaa he
 In 2014, the BJP won by hacking
 shuja ne ye bhi daawa kiya ki haal ke rajasthan, madhyapradesh or chhattisgarh chunaav main bhi iviem hekking kii koshish hui, lekin usne ise intercept kar diya
 BJP said- Congress sponsored program, BJP directly called the hackathon a Congress sponsored event
 landan ke hekathon main congress netaa kapil sibbal kii maujuudagi ne bijepi ko hamale kaa or mauka de diya
 However, the BJP is trying to call it a Congress-sponsored hacking horror show
 america haikar ne ye daawey kiye the-evm ko grafite aadhaarit transmeter se hack kiya ja saktaa he
 - EVM without Bluetooth and wifi can be hacked
 -hekking ke liye EVM ke chipset ko bypass karnaa hota he
 The 2014 election used evms with graphite-based transmitters
 -isse 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main EVM main herpher kii gai
 evms also tampered in UP, Gujarat and Maharashtra elections
 gopinath munde kii maut par bhi sawalhaikar ne ye bhi daawa kiya ki EVM main hekking kii baat bijepi ke purv netaa gopinath munde jaanate the
 That is why he was murdered
 darasal, landan main press conferes kaa aayojan indian jarnlist association kii ore se kiya gaya, jisamen congress ke varisht netaa or purv kendriya mantri kapil sibbal bhi maujuud the
 The Election Commission has put forward its stand, but in the election year, the controversy over evms will only end, it does not seem possible
 abhi shuja ne koi saboot pesh nahin kiye hai
 Now it has to be seen whether the press conference from America to London was just air or air
 ayodhya kaa maamla jitna purana he utani hi pechida bhi
 a new twist in this case came when the Congress government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1989 approved the foundation stone of the temple
 kaha jaataa he ki upi ke pramukh santadevarahaa babaake kehane par aisa kiya gaya tha
 Narayan Dutt Tiwari was the Chief Minister of UP at that time
 aise ulajhata gaya mudda1980 main biechpi ne dharmasansad main ram mandir banane kaa pran liya tha
 After this the issue started getting heated
 1982 main faijabad jila nyaayadhish ne aadesh diya ki vivaadit parisar kaa taala khol diya jaae
 He also gave Hindus the right to worship at the disputed site
 shahbaano masale kii kaat chahie theis bich shahbaano ko guzaara bhatta dene ke supreme court ke faisle kaa virodh muslim sanghathan joardaar tareeke se karne lage the
 Under their pressure, the Rajiv government at the Center overturned the Supreme Court's decision by passing the Muslim Women (right to Protection in Divorce) Act, (1986), repealing the compensation paid to Muslim women
 is dauraan adwani ram mandir ko mudda banaakar hinduon main apni pakad majboot karte ja rahe the
 Rajiv was told that only a big step can remove the resentment of Hindus from the Congress
 bootaa singh bane the sutaradharshilanyas ke thik ek hafte pehlerajeev gandhiki mulaakaat us samay ke mashhoor baba devarahaa se karai gai thi
 Buta Singh was the architect of this meeting in Gorakhpur

 Baba told him that 'let the child be'
 yani ram mandir kaa bhoomi pujan ho jane do
 The then Chief Minister Narayan Dutt Tiwari and Union Home Minister Buta Singh also accompanied Rajiv Gandhi in this meeting
 iske baad 10 november 1989 ko ram mandir kii aadharshila rakhi gai thi
 The then Director General of Police of Uttar Pradesh, R
 pi
 Joshi had confessed in the media that the foundation stone of the Ram temple was laid at the behest of the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
 joshi ne yah bhi bataaya ki ve keval dilli or lakhanu main baithe apane ucchadhikariyon ke adeshon kaa paalan kar rahe the
 The Rajasthan Congress has expelled 28 of its rebels from the party for 6 years

 Of these 28 leaders, 20 are candidates who contested on the Congress ticket the last time too
 congress ne har vidhansabha kshetra main apane netaaon ko bhej kar baagi ummidavaaron ko manaane kii koshish kii
 Congress in-charge Avinash Pandey said that despite all efforts, those who did not believe have been shown the way out
 haalanki, avinaash pandey ke mutabik pichley 10 dinon main party ne 18 netaaon ko manaane main kamyaabi pai he
 It is being said that most of the rebels are supporters of Ashok Gehlot, who did not get the ticket
 haalanki, mana ja rahaa he ki gahalot samarthak hone kii vajah se hi naam vaapasi kii antim taarikh 21 november biit jane ke baavjood in par karrwai nahin kii gai
 Similarly, BJP has also expelled its top leaders from the party for 6 years

 is world cap main abhi tak kaaphi kuch aisa hua he jo footbal ke diwaanon ko chaunkaa rahaa he
 The legendary players, veteran teams have all said goodbye to the World Cup
 worldcup main bhale hi mesi-ronaldo jaise star baahar ho gaye hon, lekin brazil ke nemaar kaa jaadu barkaraar he
 Neymar appeared in his color against Mexico on Monday
 nemaar ke gol kii hi badaulat brazil ne mexico ko 2-0se maat di or quarter final main jagah bana lee
 Brazil, who have won the World Cup five times, have now come close to winning this year's title
 nemaar ne 51wein minute main pehla gol daaga, jabaki sthanapann roberto fermino ne 88wein minute main brazil kii badhat doguni kii
 If Mexico's goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa had not made some good defenses, Brazil's margin of victory would have been more
 nemaar jaisaa koi nahin
 
 !!somvaar ko kiye gaye gol ke saath hi worldcup main nemaar ke golon ko sankhya 6 pahunch gai he
 Neymar hit the target in the fewest shots, he achieved this goal in just 23 shots
 iske alaava leonnelle mesi ko 6 gol karne ke liye 67 shots kii jarurat lagi, jabaki christiano ronaldo ne 74 shots main 6 gol daage the
 For Brazil, Neymar has scored 57 goals in 89 matches so far
 is worldcup main nemaar number 1kul shot - 23shot on target - 12kul maukey banaae - 16kul foul kiye - 23world cap main tikdi kitne gol -mesi - 6nemaar - 6ronaldo - 7world cap main sarvaadhik gol karne kaa record ab brazil ke naam he
 Brazil scored two goals in the match against Mexico, taking their total to 228 goals
 germany ke naam world cap main 226 gol darj hai
 228 Goals: Brazil 226 Goals: Germany 137 Goals: Argentina 128 Goals: Italy 113 Goals: francebrazil made it to the quarter-finals for the seventh consecutive time (16th overall), while Mexico failed to advance to the Final-16 for the seventh consecutive time
 agar club or desh ko mila den to nemaar ne pichley 16 match main 15 gol maare hai
 That is, if you pay attention to the strike rate, Neymar is also a hit here
 jab parivaar bada ho jaataa he to vah kunba ban jaataa he or usamen aapasi prem ghatata jaataa he
 The feeling of standing behind each other decreases
 har koi apana adhikaar maangane lag jaataa he
 Something similar is happening with BJP
 party jo apane ko parivaar kahalwanaa pasand karti he ab vaisaa nahin dikhti or na hi uske vaise taur-tareeke rah gaye hai
 Decision of candidates in closed rooms, reception of party converters, neglect of hard workers, persuading senior members to make their point, opportunistic etc
 is all that was seen before
 ek samay tha ki bijepi ke ummidavaaron ko kaaphi samay pehle pataa rahata tha ki unhen kahaan se chunaav ladanaa he, lekin is baar to antim samay tak tasviir spasht nahin he
 The party used to drag the Congress to bring party convert into its fold, but today the chance of senior leaders leaving their constituency to go to safe place is clearly visible in the queue of defectors
 kai netaaon kaa ahankaar to himalay se bhi bada hota ja rahaa he
 The leaders of the party's low status are marginalized
 unki koi sunwaayee nahin he
 This means that the old form of the party has changed
 ab bijepi vah party nahin rahi jo kabhi apni adarsh bhari baton or vyavhaar ke liye jaani jaati thi
 In the greed to win more and more seats, the party has changed its character
 isamen itane badlaav ho rahe hai ki lagata he yah kuch dinon main puraani congress jaisi ho jaaegi jiskaa ekmaatr uddeshy kisi bhi haalat main satta paanaa hota tha or uske liye jod-tod saamaanya si baat thi
 You can say that it is human nature to change with changing times and how long a party can survive
 bijepi bhi badal gai he
 When the character of the country changes, how can the parties remain the same? Despite all its idealistic talk, the BJP stands today where it should not have been, but the attraction of power is very deadly
 isse bachanaa mushkil he, so party bhi badal gai he or usee raste par chalane lagi he jis par itane saalon se congress chal rahi he
 What will happen next is difficult to say
 lekin itnaa tay he ki yah rasta bahut lanbaa nahin jaataa

 In the budget speech, he mentioned the blue economy
 unhone kaha ki desh kii arthvyavastha ko badhaane ke liye is baar modi sarkaar is par jor degi

 - saal 2010 main ai gunter poli kii kitaab 'the Blue Economy: 10 years, 100 innovations, 100 million jobs' main pehali baar blue iconomi ke concept ko mahatv mila tha
 Which had the following points

 In which dynamic business models are designed keeping in mind the protection of the environment
 - 'blue growth' ke jariye sansadhano kii kami or kachare ke niptaare kii samasya kaa samaadhaan kiye jane kii koshish hoti he
 - It also ensures sustainable development so that large scale human welfare is taken care of
 - blue iconomi ke tahat samudr bhi saaf-suthra rakhaa jayega taaki bade paimaane par samudr se utpaadan ho
 Currently, the main focus under the Blue Economy is on marine products including minerals
 - blue iconomi kaa concept kahin zyada vyapak he or isamen samudri gatividhiyaan bhi shaamil hai
 - Blue economy structure is environment friendly because big cargo goods can be moved from one place to another in the marine area without the help of trucks or railways
 is agenda ke tahat samudr main paryaavaran ke anukool infrastakchar taiyaar karnaa hoga
 At the same time, shifting some infrastructure towards the sea is a good economic and political strategy
 yah bharat main mumkin bhi he
 Let me tell you, NITI Aayog has done work to give a new direction to the economy of the country
 is yojana ke tahat teji se badhati arthvyavastha or lambii samudri simaaon kaa bharpoor istemaal karte hue desh ko 'blue iconomi' ke taur par khadaa karnaa he
