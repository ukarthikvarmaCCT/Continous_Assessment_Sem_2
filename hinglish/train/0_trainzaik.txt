 We have double the rate of malnutrition here compared to the very poorest countries in Africa, while we are much more prosperous than that
 isaki sabase badi vajah yah he ki bacchon kaa poshan mata-pita kii praathamiktaaon main nahin he
 We do not know clearly what to do to overcome it, but if the big stars of film and cricket are made part of the big government campaign of nutrition then it will not do any harm
 swasthya seva ke kshetra main bhi bahut gadabadiyaan hai
 All our debate on policies revolves around government nurses, doctors and private hospitals
 ham is tathy ko puri tarah darkinar kar dete hai ki swasthya seva kaa ek bada varg is duniya ke baahar bhi he, jahaan sadak kinare lagi dukaanon par jhela chhap doctor antibiotic or steroeads baanta karte hai
 To tackle this problem, it is important that we start talking on this subject
 iske liye sarkaar ko vyapak janasahyog ke saath ek rashtriya swasthya ayog kii sthapana kerani chahie taaki swasthya sevaaon kii puri vyavastha ko amulchul badalane ke liye krantikari dhang se vichaar kiya ja sake
 It is meant to say that doctors should not be recruited in the commission only because the doctors have to straighten their owl too
 teen saal main puraa karemposhak tatwon par dhyaan dekar poshan ko behatar banane ke liye kaaphi kuch kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, special emphasis should be laid on iron to fight anemia
 in poshak tatwon ko apane paaramparik bhojan main shaamil karne ke tareeke dhundhna or unhen bade paimaane par uplabdh karnaa praathamikta honi chahie (ise skool ke bhojan yaa saarvajanik vitaran pranali kaa hissaa banane jaisaa kuch karke)
 There is a growing consciousness among people about how much pollution our cities are suffering
 dilli ke aage beijing swarg jaisaa lagata he
 Polluters should be monitored and punished
 hamaare shaharon ke garib ilaakon main pine kaa saaf pani or samuchit saaf-safai ab bhi durlabh cheez he
 The old rules related to land, dull schemes of urban development and sluggish and weak urban management are responsible for this
 hamen yah sab badalane kii jarurat he
 The objective of the Integrated Child Development Scheme was to provide a basic foundation for poor children to move forward
 lekin yah yojana itane lachar dhang se kaam kar rahi he ki zyaadaatar mata-pita ise bich main hi chhod dete hai
 There is a need to revisit this plan and decide its form again
 paanch saal main puraa karenyah vivekpurna he ki paanch saal kii samay seemaa ke saath kuch lakshya tay kiye jaaen
 Many fundamental points have been considered in this direction, but more important questions still need to be explored
 shiksha ke kshetra main hamaara lakshya yah hona chahie ki primary shiksha kii umr ke 50 fisadi se zyada bachche shiksha hasil karen or apane str kii ganit ke sawaal hal kar saken
 There should be a universal transfer program for financial assistance, which includes all urban and rural citizens
 yah sahyog pradaan karne kii prakriya main bank khaaton tak hamaari vaishvik pahunch hogi, jahaan log apane dhan ko surakshit rakh sakenge
 In the case of child malnutrition, our goal is to halve the rate of cases of severe malnutrition
 vayaskon ke sambandh main gambhir anemia ke maamalon main lagbhag ek-tihaai kii kami laana he
 Our aim in the cities should be that the number of people who are not able to access clean drinking water and sanitation system is reduced by one-third
 vaayu main maujuud pradooshak tatwon kii dar 60 microgram prati cubic meter se kam karnaa hamaara lakshya hona chahie
 In healthcare, the projected target is very simple ‚Äî a quarter of infant and maternal mortality reduction in the next five years
 vrihattar lakshya thodaa jatil he or uske swaroop or maatra ko nirdhaarit karnaa mushkil he: masalan, hamaari swasthya seva vyavastha ko tarksangat or auchitypurna bananaa
 Making better use of the large number of doctors and nurses present in the government machinery, who do very little other than getting paid
 neem-hakimon or aadhyatmik upachaarkon ko ekajute kiya jaae taaki unka behatar prashikshan or niyaman kiya ja sake
 None of this is easy

 He wanted to find out if his girlfriends fit for a marriage relationship
 yah test lene ke liye usne apni garlfriend ko apane gande or avyavasthit kamare par bulaayaa
 He thought that if his girlfriend started cleaning after entering the house, then she deserved to be his wife

 salmaan khan ne himesh reshmia ko brake diya tha
 Himesh has also given credit to Salman Khan many times
 ab himesh ne minderox 2019 main salmaan ke us ek sawaal ke bare main bataaya, jisane unki jindagi badal di
 Which question of Salman made Himesh a superstar? Talking about Salman, Himesh said- 'I was 13 years old
 maine salmaan ke gane gaae
 Salman Bhai gave me a break
 uske baad mujhe saxes mil gai
 But he said that anyone can give 5-6 success songs
 lekin industry main kaise jagah banaaoge
 i found this thing challenging
 ''maine us vakt 350 nae gane gaae, sabhi ko test karaae
 i gave the option of 350 songs to the makers
 maine mekars ko majaboor kiya ki bade compoger ko chhodkar mujhe brake die
 i played 350 songs instead of 1 song
 manzil ko paane ke liye maa-baap kaa bharosa, mehnat, kismat main bharosa, acchhee niyat or atitude jaruri he
 i made songs in stock
 'bada godfadar yaa bada mauka, kya sochate hai himesh?bada godfadar yaa bada mauka? is sawaal par himesh ne kaha- sabase pehle to kismat hoti he
 But you will definitely get a chance in life when you are very close to your destination
 'jaise chaar saal kaa vakt le lijie agar aadmi apana kariyar shuru karata he to usko ek mauka kahin naa kahin jarur milegaa
 So someone will say that in two minutes, if i like it, i will take it
 par wo do minute main aapke paas wo content hona chahie jo industry main kisi ke paas naa ho
 If your preparation is not strong, then the two minutes you have received in those four years will be missed
 phir aapako chaar saal intjaar karnaa padegaa
 Use your free time
 mujhe salmaan bhai mili, aapako koi or jarur milegaa
 Just keep your preparation complete

 hindu dharm main holi ko ek pramukh tyohaar mana jaataa he
 People across the country celebrate it with great pomp and play with fierce colors
 is dauraan unhen apane sharir or twachaa kaa bhi khyaal nahin rahata
 The colors contain artificial chemicals
 insaan kii twachaa kaaphi najuk hoti he or rangon ke sampark main aakar kharaab bhi ho sakati he
 Therefore, one needs to be very careful while playing with colors
 ye paanch tips apanaayenge to jamkar khelenge holi or nahin hogi koi samasya
 1- If your skin should not play with colors with dryness
 holi khilne se pehle agar aap apane puure badan main acchhee tarah se nariyal ke tel kii maalish karenge to kaaphi phayda hoga
 Apart from this, it is also necessary to apply mustard oil to the hair so that the colors can be released easily while bathing
 2- agar aap zyada samay tak dhoop main holi khelte hai to kabhi bhi sanscreen lagaana naa bhoolen
 Apart from this, you can also apply thick colored nailpants on your nails
 aksar dekha gaya he ki agar ek baar rang nakhun main lag jaae to use chhudaana bahut mushkil ho jaataa he
 Lathmar Holi in Barsana, Mathura3 arrived in UP CM Yogi - Apart from this, there is a special need to take care of the eyes as well
 hamaari ankhen kaaphi samvedansheel hoti hai or rangon ke chemicals kii vajah se unhen nuksaan ho saktaa he
 During this time, if we put sunglasses in the eyes, then we can protect the eyes from harm
 4- agar aap holi khelte vakt jakhmi ho jate hai or sharir main kahin par bhi chot lag jaati he to use andekha karnaa bevakoofi bharaa faisla hoga
 Immediately at that place you need to apply antibacterial lotion and cover it with band-aid
 bharat nahin yahaan manaai jaati he duniya kii sabase badi holi!5- rangon main baari maatra main chemicals kii milawat kii jaati he
 In this, it is very difficult to find out which color is right
 is silsile main jaruri yahi hoga ki aap herbal rangon kaa istemaal karen, yaa ho sake to ghar main khud hi rang bana len
 Apart from this, it is also necessary to take care not to stay in wet clothes for long time and wash your hands from time to time

 During the discussion on the budget in the Lok Sabha, the issue of Rafael Deal was overshadowed
 congress party kii ore se rafel deal main bhrashtachar ke aaropon par vitt mantri arun jetali ne sadan main bayaan diya
 Answering the questions of the Congress, Jaitley said that the Congress wants to play with the national interest knowing the price of Rafael Deal
 rahul gandhi bhi sadan main is mudde par bolnaa chaahate the or unhone aarope lagaaya ki unhen mauka die bina hi sadan ko sthagit kar diya gaya, jabaki unhen safai dene adhikaar tha kyonki jetali ne sadan main congress adhyaksh ko sidhe taur par sambodhit bhi kiya tha
 Rahul has also tweeted a tweet on this issue
 Q
 Why did the Raksha Mantri change her stance from: i will reveal the price of the RAFALE planes in Nov 2017 to the price is a state secret in Feb 2018A
 corruptionb
 To protect modijic
 To protect Modiji's friendd
 All of the above # thegreatrafalemystery ‚Äî Office of RG (@officeofrg) February 8, 2018 Rahul alleged that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had earlier said that she would tell the country about the price of Rafale airplane
 lekin ab raksha mantri apane bayaan se palatate hue ise rashtrahit kaa mudda bataakar saarvajanik nahin karnaa chaahatin
 Rahul alleged that both of her statements cannot be true, she is lying somewhere
 congress adhyaksh ne aarope lagaate hue kaha ki rafel maamle main bhrashtachar hua he
 Asking three questions, he said that the Prime Minister went to Khudperis and took approval from Faisalia or the Cabinet Committee on Defense
 doosraa ek bijness main ko contract dene kaa kya kaaran tha or teesraa hawaii jahaaj ke liye jo keemat di he wo pradhanmantri desh ko bataaen
 Earlier, Finance Minister Jaitley said in the House that during the UPA government from Pranab Mukherjee to many other former defense ministers, the price and details of security deals were never made public as it compromises security
 saath hi rashtrahit main ise kabhi bhi saarvajanik nahin kiya jaataa
 First take reply from Pranab Rahul Gandhi, citing the reply of Pranab Mukherjee, former Minister of Defense, said that if Congress President wants to know the details and price of Rafael Deal, first go to Pranab Mukherjee
 jetali ne kaha ki aisi jaankaree jab ham saarvajanik karte hai to hamaare dushman ko bhi hamaari takat or kamajori kaa pataa chalata he
 Following the Finance Minister's remarks, there was a heated debate between Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and Jaitley in the House
 tharur ne kaha ki vitt mantri aap ek jimmedaar pad par hai aise menaapaki javabdehi banati heki aise mudde par aap desh ko jawaab den
 Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge also objected to the Finance Minister's remarks
 haalanki baad main vitt mantri ke sambodhan ke saath kii sadan kii kaarywahi shuukravaar tak ke liye sthagit kar di gai
 The pain of Samajwadi Party founder and former Defense Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, who has been missing from the political scene for a long time, spilled during an event on Friday and became extremely emotional
 samaajawaadee vichaarak or purv mantri bhagwati singh ke 86wein janm diwas ke avasar par yojit ek kaarykram ke dauraan unhone kaha, 'aaj meraa koi sammaan nahin karata, lekin shaayad mere marane ke baad ke baad log aisa karen
 Mulayam Singh said during the speech that Ram Manohar Lohia also used to say that no one respects while alive
 behad bhavuk andaaj main mulaayam singh ne aage kaha, 'lohia ke saath bhi aisa hi hua tha
 Lohia used to say that while living in this country, no one is respected
 'mulaayam singh pichley saal party main netritv ko lekar bete or bhai ke bich hue paariwarik jhagade ke baad raajnneetik paridrishy main zyada sakriy nahin dikhte hai
 During the controversy last year, he had said that the son, who is not the father's brother, will be with whom
 phir bhi meraa aashirwad bete ke saath he, lekin vah unke faislon se sahamat nahin hai
 In September last year, Mulayam had said about the son Akhilesh during Navratri, "the son Akhilesh turned out to be a fraudster, he is not saying that we are sitting on the biggest post in the country
" 'party main uttaradhikaar vivaad ko lekar unke bhai shivpal or bete akhilesh ke bich joardaar tanatani dikhi thi
 At that time, Mulayam was so angry with Akhilesh that he had kept a distance from the assembly elections last year
 haalanki chunaav ke chalate unhone akhilesh ke lekar khulkar koi bada bayaan nahin diya tha kaha tha ki jaapane pita kaa nahin hua wo kisi or kaa kyaahoga
 Mulayam Singh has deep pain behind these things because he has no control over the party
 puure tareeke se party kii kaman akhilesh yadav ke haath main he or chaahakar bhi mulaayam apni marji se kuch nahin kar paa rahe
 This is the reason why Mulayam's pain is erupting and Akhilesh Yadav is at the center of this pain

 janata kii pareshaani ko dekhte hue modi sarkaar ko yah faisla waapas lenaa chahie
 CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said that the decision of the government is not good, not visionary
 itnaa hi nahin narendra modi ne 2014 main kaha tha ki desh kaa 96 fisadi kaala dhan videshon main jamaa he, lekin wo un naamon ko saarvajanik kyon nahin kar rahe hai
 Due to the ban on five hundred and one thousand notes, common people are facing difficulties
 unhone kaha ki aavashyak sevaaon ko dhyaan main rakhkar puraane noton ke istemaal kii anumati deni chahie
 CPM General Secretary says that even though Modi is asking for 50 days time from the people, this matter cannot be ended so soon
 seetaram yechuri kaa kahana he ki sarkaar jo baat kah rahi he ki 500-1000 ke note band hone se aatankiyon kii bhi qamar tut jaaegi
 Because he also used the currency of big notes
 seetaram yechurine sarkaar ke is bayaan par sawaal karte hue kaha he ki aatanki bag main paise bharkar idhar-udhar nahin karte hai

 rajyasabha main jediu se saansad harivansh or abhinayta shekhar suman ne 'panchayat aaj tak' main bihar ke badlaav kii vakaalat kii
 Shekhar Suman said that lack of political will is having a bad effect in our society
 vahiin, harivansh ne bihar ko nazarandaaj kiye jane par sawaal uthaae
 Harivansh: Law and order has appeared in Bihar over the years
 yah sirf aparaadh tak simit nahin he
 Administration has improved to the village and block level
 santhaan or sansthaaon kaa vikashua
 Moving forward with every section of society
 cycle yojana kaa prayaas safal rahaa or iskaa asar aage aane vaale samay main dikhegaa
 These are the basic things
 vikaas ke raste par bihar bad rahaa he
 There was a time when Raj Kapoor had to come to Bihar
 aaj palaayan bahut badi samasya he
 Where is the disturbance Hashekhar Suman: If there is a lack of political will, then it also affects the society
 humlog bahut zyada vakt bahes or charchaa main bitaa dete hai
 The onset is slow
 ham vikaas or badlaav ko lekar bahes karte rah jate hai or ek samay ke baad ise koi sunanaa nahin chahta
 The reason for this is the lack of both political will and political vision
 infrastracchar bahut myne rakhata he
 Even when the plane is taking off at the airport, four dogs are racing with it
 itani hidaayaten aati hai
 There is not a five star hotel in such a big city
 ye satahi chije hai
 But if someone comes from outside, they influence
 wo koun si sthiti thi ki rajya main jo nunatam jarurate hai wo nahin mil pain? janata ke bheetar netaaon ko lekar gussa he ki kuch ho nahin rahaa
 Shekhar: Anger will always be there
 kyonki jo vaade kiye jate hai wo puure nahin hote
 The leader, we will do why we did not say instead
 ek baar main nal or duusare baar main pani kyon aata he
 Why there is no water system with tap at once
 ye kekade vaale sthiti he ki kaatna uski aadat he
 Saying nothing happens
 main bihar utarataa hum to mujhe yahaan kaa chunaav saidhantik ladaai bataaya jaataa he
 But i think there is a poster fight here
 meraa poster sabase bada
 Jumle is condemned and jumla is offered in response
 raajnneetik ichhashakti kii kami iske liye sidhe taur par uttaradaayi he
 There is no water system, no road, all are going through the fields
 aisa nahin he ki ho nahin saktaa, soch le to jarur ho saktaa he
 Political options did not come out
 harivansh:aaj aayaa he ki gujarat bijness karne ke liye sabase sahi he
 But what has happened there is not hidden from anyone
 darasal,bihar ko negalect kiyagaya
 Discrimination occurred with Bihar intentionally
 bihar 1974 main jagaa, usne sapana dekha
 In past years, efforts were made in Bihar to spend on human labor
 bihar main apni aarthik pragati se dikhaa diya ki vah sabase aage he or use uskaa haq milanaa chahie
 Where is the economic model that we are going in the country
 bihar abhi bhi krishi aadhaarit he
 The state is still fighting for the minimum
 harivansh:nitish kumaar kaa jo krishi rodmap he vah is ore ek koshish he
 You will see that after IIM studies, boys are coming and working in the field of agriculture in the state
 jo poonjeevaad kaa sankat he uskaa vaikalpik model kya hoga, ye main nahin bataa saktaa
 Be it Bollywood or Journalism, people of Bihar are everywhere
 to aisa kaaran he ki log aa nahin rahe hai
 Shekhar: When the political atmosphere is not right, nothing will happen
 ham garv se kehete hai ki iees, adhikari, padhaane vaale sab bihari hai, lekin bihar kii haalat khasta he
 The reason is that the atmosphere in Bihar is not right
 suvidhaayen nahin hai
 The reason is that narrow politics has continued here
 jaat paat se upar uthakar rajya soch nahin paa rahaa
 Political people are not able to create atmosphere
 jab tak raajnneeti ke log sahi rasta nahin dikhaaenge log us par chalenge kaise
 Only if the principal of the school is good, the students will get good
 political vil kii jarurat he
 You will see that as the country is strengthening in the economy
 logon kaa vishwaas jag rahaa he, jo bhartiya videshon main based hai wo hindustan laut rahe hai
 The same will happen with Bihar, if there is development
 lekin jaahir he kuch log nahin chaahate ki aisa ho or unki raajnneeti chalati rahe
 There were riots in Gujarat, riots in Maharashtra
 bihar main aisa nahin hua lekin koi to kaaran he jo nae bihar ko roak rahaa he
 Harivansh: You see that there are huge possibilities in the world
 jaiprakash narayan chicago main padhate the
 He could get a big job
 lekin unhone raajnneeti ke baahar rahakar nai parampara shuru kii or samaaj ko jagaane kii koshish kii
 He created excitement among the people and instilled faith
 mujhe ummid he ki bihar main koi aisa paidaa hoga
 i hope that the people of Bihar who are outside will come and wake up
 sumnahpiche kii baaten bahut kii jaati hai
 Names are taken of those who contributed to the development of Bihar
 lekin aage kya karnaa he ye koi nahin bolta
 Why not talk further? Memories of childhood holi, diwaali manaate the

 Shekhar Suman finally said, 'it is very important to bring the right party in government

 Sometimes there are lumps in the alliance

 The 17th of this month became an unforgettable day full of good news for Bhojpuris around the world
 darasal bhojpuri bhashiyon, chintakon, vichaarkon, sahityakaron, netaaon or janata ke varshon kii mehnat va sangharsh kaa hi parinaam tha ki is din sansad main grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram reported in Bhojpuri language that "we understand the spirit of everyone", that Bhojpuri language will be included in the eighth list of the Constitution in the monsoon session
 darasal varshon pehle san 2006 main tatkaaleen grih mantri ne bhi sadan main yahi soochna di thi
 In the meantime, the issue was raised strongly by honorable mps many times
 is dauraan lagaataar kai sanghathanon ne is maang ko lekar andolan bhi kiya
 Many Bhojpuri organizations working in the country and abroad also raised their voice
 pichley kuch varshon main bhojpuri bhashaa ko lekar kai aitihaasik kaary hue
 In 2009, the study of the Aadhaar course started in Bhojpuri at IGNOU, the world's largest university
 yahi nahin ignu main 'bhojpuri bhashaa, sahitya evam samskruti centre' kii bhi sthapana kii gai
 The struggle i had to face and the pain i suffered while starting this course from ignou's vision of this course also led to the emergence of the poem "bhojpuri Mai Khatir"
 mere liye yah yuddh kaa maidan ban gaya tha
 i also swore that Bhojpuri Mai was dyed on the throne
 bhojpuri sansar ke fatah ke avasar par prasangvash is kavita kii kuch panktiyaan uddhrut karnaa aavashyak samajhataa hum, bhojpuri paathyakram ke virodh main shadyantr rachaa ja rahaa tha
 Thanl ba juddha, bandhal ba sama-samay, lie on one side, and Murakh's army on the right side and truth and equality
 
 
 baithihe singhaasana pe bhojpuri maai ke jeetjit ke i thanal juddha, jeet ke i thanal juddha17 may ko spasht rup se grih mantri ne karodon bhojpuriyon kii bhaavana ko bhojpuri main hi vyakt kiya to yah tay ho gaya ki bhojpuri bhashaa ko ''samvidhan kii aathvin suchi'' main shaamil kar liya jayega
 Actually, languages are the most important gift given by man to man
 kisi bhi bhashaa ko tushtikaran kii drushti se na to mahatv diya janaa chahie or na hi uski upeksha kii jaani chahie
 It is not appropriate to do cheap politics about any language because the store of knowledge has been accumulated only through languages
 agali sadi tak duniya kii vibhinn bhashaaon ke khatm hone kaa andeshaa he
 In such a situation, the statement of the Home Minister shows how vigilant we are in this matter
 lekin bhojpuri bhashaa ko yah sammaan varshon pehle mil janaa chahie tha, kyonki isamen vah sab kuch he jo use vishwa str kii bhashaa ke samakaksh rakhata he
 Bhojpuri is a very ancient, independent and prosperous language
 17 deshon main faile 20 karod bhojpuri bhashi hai
 It is ridiculous that Hindi will be weak if Bhojpuri or such language is expanded

 On 15 February, Team India will make their debut in the World Cup against Pakistan
 team india dephending champion he or is baar khitaab bachaane kii jimmedaari uske 'kamjor' kandhon par he
 The term weak has been used here because from the current state of the team, it seems that we will not be able to defend the World Cup title
 ye hai aisi paanch baaten, jise dekhakar lagata he ki team india nahin bachaa paaegi world cap khitaab
 Only Team India will win the World Cup, here are 5 reasons
 team main sab kuch thik-thaak nahin!team india kii sabase badi mushkil ye he ki dressing room kaa maahaul gadabadaya hua he
 in the recently concluded Test series against Australia 
 brisben test main viraat kohli or shikhar dhawan donon ke bich ballebaaji posishan ko lekar bahes hui or iskaa nuksaan team ko match ganvaakar chukaana padaa
 After the match, Captain Cool Dhoni also said that the atmosphere in the dressing room was disturbed
 iske baad siries ke tisare test ke baad emes dhoni ne achaanak test cricket ko alavida kah diya
 There were reports that Dhoni retired because of the growing proximity between Virat Kohli and team director Ravi Shastri
 aakhri test match main viraat jaise hi captain bane plaing ilevan se shikhar dhawan ko baahar kar diya gaya
 Although his poor form was also a reason behind the dismissal of Dhawan, there were reports that the two players still have not recovered everything
 iske baad tri siries ke dauraan viraat kohli ne twitor par kuch aisa kar daalaa ki unke or dhoni ke bich kii dooriyaan ujagar ho gayi
 Virat retweeted a news report stating that Dhoni was involved in spot-fixing
 ab do maheene ke andar itani sari khabaren afvaah to ho nahin sakati hai, lihaaja yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki team main sabakuch thik-thaak nahin he
 2
 ballebaajon kaa bura haal
 
 
 The biggest strength of Team India is out of form at the moment
 team india kaa koi bhi ballebaaj aisi form main nahin he jisase tasalli ho sake ki bhai match niklava degaa ye to
 In the Test series, Virat Kohli's bat was running like a fire, but in the current ODI tri-series, he has also calmed down
 rohit sharma, ajinkya rahane, khud captain dhoni, viraat, shikhar dhawan in sabakaa haal bura he
 Talking about Dhawan, it seems that after reaching his in-laws, he has forgotten to score runs
 in sabhi ballebaajon main koi bhi aise nahin khel rahaa he jisapar aankh band karke bharosa kiya ja sake
 Amidst all this, Suresh Raina is also miles away from form and Ravindra Jadeja will return after being out of the team for a long time after shoulder injury
 3
 Confidence has been raised by bowlers, bowling has never been a strong side of Team India, the situation has become worse at the moment
 bhubaneshwar kumaar, mohammad shami, aar aswin, umesh yadav sabaki jis tarah tri siries or test siries main dhunaai hui he usase koi bhi total dephend kar paanaa naammumkin sa najar aa rahaa he
 The current bowling conditions are such that if the team scores 400 runs, then it will not be able to defend them
 eshanth sharma injuri se ubar chuke hai lekin unki form bhi aisi nahin he ki bharosa kiya ja sake
 Akshar Patel has definitely impressed but how successful he will be in the World Cup, only time will tell
 4
 Fusid Hai Fielding Bhitim has agile fielders like Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja, Ajinkya Rahane but at the moment the fielding of the team is also seen
 tri siries main viraat ne boundry line par dive to khub maarin lekin chaukaa bachaane main kai ahm maukon par fail ho gaye
 Fielding has also deteriorated significantly with Shikhar Dhawan's batting form
 field par ran bachaane or kaich lapakane ke liye team india ke paas bahut shandaar fielder nahin hai
 5
 dher 'team india' or 'chaupat' raja2011 world cap ke final match main dhoni kaa chakka, 2007 tii-20 world cap ke final main joginder sharma ko aakhri over saunpane kaa saahasik faisla bhuule nahin bhuulataa he
 Remember when was the last time you saw Dhoni playing the role of a finisher in a match? Dhoni's helicopter shot has not been seen for a long time
 team india ek ore dher he or duusari ore dhoni ke faisle bhi chaupat sabit ho rahe hai
 Dhoni's Midas touch seems to be over

 In other words, exports from France by Dassault
 HAL yaa koi bhi anya isamen production agency nahin ho sakati kyonki koi bhi vimaan bharat main nahin bananaa he
 Reliance Defense says that the Ministry of Defense has no role in the selection of Indian partners of foreign vendors
 2005 se abhi tak 50 ofaset kantrect sin ho chuke hai sab main ek hi prakriya apanaai gai he
 Reliance Defense has said in its reply that only the Ministry of Defense can answer this question correctly
 lekin ye samajhnaa behatar hoga ki DPP-2016 ke mutabik videshi vendor ko is chunaav kii suvidha he ki wo ofaset credits ke daawey ke samay apane ofaset parteners kaa byoraa de sake
 In this case the offset obligations will be due only after September 2019
 isliye ye sambhav he ki raksha mantralay ko Dassault se uske ofaset parteners ke bare main koi aupchaarik jaankaree naa mili ho
 The comments yah kisi deal he ki april 2015 se agast 2018 aa gaya abhi tak raksha mantralay ko jaankaree hi nahin he, dasso aviation ne jaankaree hi nahin di he, reliance ke is jawaab ke baad kam se kam raksha mantralay ko to jawaab dena hi chahie
 Now in response to a question, Reliance Defense says that it has not got the contract for 30,000 crore
 dasso aviation kis ofaset partner ko kitna kaam degi, yah abhi tay nahin hua he
 Dasso Aviation has pointed to more than 100 Indian companies for this
 isamen se do sarkari companiyaan hai echeel or bharat electronics limited
 We do not understand what it means to make a gesture, Reliance is now saying that the Ministry of Defense may not know about the offset partner, but Reliance knows that there can be more than 100 offset partners
 isamen do sarkari companiyaan bhi hai
 Is it possible that the Ministry of Defense does not even know that much
 kya aap is jawaab se santusht hue
 Well let's move on
 reliance dephence ne us sawaal kaa jawaab diya he ki ek aisi company ko theka kaise mil gaya jiske paas koi anubhav nahin he
 We should correct our facts
 is contract ke tahat koi ladaaku vimaan nahin banaae jane hai kyonki sabhi vimaan france se fli awe condishan main aane hai
 Except for HAL in India, no company has experience in making fighter aircraft
 agar is tark ke hisaab se chalem to iskaa matlab hoga ki ham jo abhi he uske alaava kabhi koi nai kshamta nahin bana paaenge
 And 70% of defense-related hardware will continue to be imported
 ek or sawaal kiya gaya kiya ki jab pradhanmantri paris main deal kaa elaan kar rahe the to anil ambani vahaan kyon maujuud the? ambani france or anya deshon ke liye CEO forum kaa hissaa the
 He was in Paris because the CEO Forum was also meeting there during the Prime Minister's visit
 bhartiya company ke 25 anya CEO bhi vahaan maujuud the
 He was also the chairman of HAL
 is jawaab main aapane suna ki pradhanmantri ke saath anya siio bhi the jinamein hindustan aironotics limited ke chairman bhi thi
 The question is why Hindustan Aeronautics Limited was excluded
 yah kisi deal he ki april 2015 se agast 2018 aa gaya abhi tak raksha mantralay ko jaankaree hi nahin he, dasso aviation ne jaankaree hi nahin di he, reliance ke is jawaab ke baad kam se kam raksha mantralay ko to jawaab dena hi chahie

 The question is why Hindustan Aeronautics Limited was excluded
 hamen apane tathy sahi kar lene chahie
 No fighter aircraft are to be built under this contract as all aircraft are to come in fly away condition from France
 bharat main HAL ko chhod kisi bhi company ko ladaaku vimaan banane kaa anubhav nahin he
 If we follow this logic, it will mean that we will never be able to create any new capacity other than what we have now
 or raksha se jude 70% hardware ko aayaat karte rahenge
 Another question was asked that when the Prime Minister was announcing the deal in Paris, why was Anil Ambani present there? Ambani was part of the CEO Forum for France and other countries
 wo paris main isliye the, kyonki pradhanmantri ke daure ke dauraan vahaan CEO forum kii bhi baithak thi
 25 other ceos of the Indian company were also present there
 inamen HAL ke chairman bhi the
 In this reply you heard that along with the Prime Minister there were other ceos including the Chairman of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited
 sawaal to yahi he ki hindustan aironotics limited ko kyon baahar kiya gaya

 The revelations by Modi threatened the RSW to send him a legal notice alleging that the IPL president had breached the terms of confidentiality and also complained to BCCI president Shashank Manohar in this regard
 modi ne yah bhi sanket diya ki un par is kaa dabaav tha ki ve is frenchiji ke maalikon ke naam saarvajanik nahin karen
 He said that i was told not to disclose the owners of the franchise, especially about Sunanda Pushkar
 kyonki udhar tharur ne kaha ki ve is frenchiji ke shairdharak nahin hai or vah keval ‚Äòfecilitator‚Äô (kochi frenchiji ko ipel main boli lagane main sahaayta karne) kii bhoomika main the

 Apart from this, if the part of the passenger is dislocated in a train accident, then the compensation amount has also been increased for that
 rail durghatana main badi hui muaavja raashi 1 janvari 2017 se lagu maani jaaegi
 Regarding increasing the compensation amount in the train accident, it is being said that this decision has been taken in view of the sentiments of the Supreme Court
 railway ke kaalaapan ke mutabik haal hi main rail accident ke maamle main adaalat kii ore se tippanee kii gai thi ki railway ko rail durghatana kii muaavja raashi banaae jane par vichaar karnaa chahie
 After this comment of the court, the Railway Board has taken necessary steps in relation to the increase in the compensation amount and has also changed its rules for this
 railway kii ore se jari gajet notification main rail haadase or is tarah kii durbhagyapurna ghatnaon ke maamle main muaavja sanshodhan 2016 kaa zikr karte hue kaha gaya he ki ab iske upanium main badlaav karke usamen likhi chaar lakh rupee kii dhanrashi ko badhaakar 8 lakh rupee kiya gaya he
 The new compensation amount rules will be applicable from 1 January 2017
 lekin railway ne yah bhi kaha he kii muaavje se jude baaki niyam kanoon pehle kii tarah hi bane rahenge yani muaavja un rail yatriyon ko hi milegaa jo tikat lekar yatra kar rahe ho
 According to the Railway Board, if a passenger's hands and feet are cut off in a train accident, then in that condition the affected railway passenger will be given a compensation of Rs 8 lakh
 isi tarah agar kisi rail yatri kaa angootha cat jaataa he to uske liye 2 lakh 40 hajaar rupee kaa muaavja diya jayega
 On the other hand, if a train passenger has four fingers of one hand cut off, then in that case the compensation of Rs 1 lakh 60 thousand will be given to the person concerned
 sanshodhit niyamon ke mutabik sabase kam muaavja 64000 hajaar rupee kaa he
 This compensation will be given to the passenger whose passenger has broken bone, humus, radius, alna, and in that condition the injured person will get compensation of 64 thousand

 Meanwhile, RJD also sent a 9 member team led by former minister and RJD leader Shivchandra Ram to Nandan village to investigate the incident
 jisane patna lautne ke baad aaj tejasvi yadav ko apni report saunpi
 The RJD report found that the attack on the Nitishke convoy was not planned but because of an administrative lapse
 gauratlab he ki jadyu ne aarope lagaaya tha ki nitish ke kafile par hamale main tejasvi yadav kii mileebhagat thi or yah hamalaa purna tareeke se suniyojit tha
 The RJD report said that there was no development work in the Mahadalits' areas and people wanted to make this problem known to Nitish Kumar
 magar aisa nahin kar paane kii vajah se unka gussa phuta or unhone nitish ke kafile par hamalaa kar diya
 Now, being hurt by the alleged atrocities on these insurgent families, Tejashwi will go to Nandan village on Saturday and share his pain
 tejasvi ne kaha ki nandan gaanv kii ghatana puri tareeke se prashasnic senior or intelligence phelior kaa nateeja he
 He said that if the government feels that Tejashwi Yadav is involved in the Nandan village incident then he should be arrested
 nitish par tanj kasate hue tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki unhen janata ke bich jaakar vikaas samiksha yatra nahin balki pashchaatap yatra kerani chahie
 Tejashwi said that for the manner in which Nitish Kumar formed the government with BJP by insulting the mandate given to the grand alliance in 2015, he should go and repent among the people
 vikaas samiksha yatra ke dauraan kai jilon main nitish kumaar kaa baari virodh dekhne ko mila he or isi par tejasvi ne kaha ki nitish kumaar ko aatm chintan karne kii jarurat he ki aakhir agar unhone vikaas kiya he to uske baavjood bhi logon ke bich itnaa gussa kyon he? After the Supreme Court's decision on the disputed land in Ayodhya, All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi has targeted senior BJP leader LK Advani
 ovaisi(asaduddin Owaisi) ne kaha ki jaisaa ki court ne is maamle par faisla sunaane ke dauraan kaha ki babari masjid gaiyr-kanoonee thi, to phir ise dhahaane ko lekar el ke adwani or anya par mukadmaa kyon chal rahaa he?hyderabad sesansad ovaisi ne supreme court ke faisle par baat karte hue kaha ki jis insaan ne kisi kaa ghar giraaya, use kaise vahi ghar diya ja saktaa he
 Addressing a public meeting, Owaisi pointed out the flaws in the Supreme Court's decision in the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid land dispute case and said that the Supreme Court is supreme but not infallible
 jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue ovaisi ne kaha ki yadi ek vyakti aapkaa ghar gira detaa he or aap panch ke paas jate hai or vah aapkaa ghar usee vyakti ko de detaa he, jisane aapkaa ghar giraaya or kahata he ki iske badale aapako duusari jagah jameen di jaaegi to aapako kaisaa lagegaa?
 All i want to ask is if the Babri Masjid was illegal, then why is the case going against the BJP leaders who demolished the mosque, including Advani and other bigwigs? Earlier, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi gave his response after the decision
 ovaisi ne news agency eenai sekaha tha ki main court ke faisle se santusht nahin hum
 The Supreme Court is at the top, but not inevitable
 hamen samvidhan par puraa bharosa he, ham apane adhikaar ke liye lard rahe hai, hamen khayratake rup main 5 acre jameen nahin chahie
 We should reject this five-acre land proposal
 ham par krupa karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Owaisi had further said what the Supreme Court would have decided if the mosque had stayed there
 yah kanoon ke khilaaf he
 If Babri Masjid does not fall, what is the decision? jinhone babari masjid ko giraaya, unhen trust banaakar ram mandir banane kaa kaam diya gaya he
 The verdict has been given with the consent of the five judges of the Supreme Court
 faisla padhane ke dauraan peeth ne kaha ki ASI report ke mutabik neeche mandir tha
 The CJI said that the ASI has also presented evidence in front of the bench to be the first temple on the disputed land
 CJI ne kaha tha ki hindu ayodhya ko ram janm sthal maanate hai
 However, the ASI could not say that the mosque was built after the temple was demolished
 muslim gavaahon ne bhi mana ki vahaan donon hi paksh puja karte the
 Ranjan Gogoi said that as per the ASI report the mosque was not built on the vacant land
 saath hi saboot pesh kiye hai ki hindu bahari aahate main puja karte the
 Also, CJI had said that Suit-5 is based on history which details the journey
 suut 5 main sitaar rasoi or singh dwaar kaa zikr he
 It is impossible for the Sunni Waqf Board to show peaceful occupation
 CJI ne kaha ki 1856-57 se pehle aantarik ahaate main hinduo par koi roak nahin thi

 a good job comes because of your qualification
 lekin is baat se mukar nahin sakate ki intervyuu dene kaa sahi tarika bhi aapako ek badhiya naukari dilaa saktaa he
 According to media reports, Rachel Bite, Chief People Officer at a recruiting software company, has said that she often makes two such mistakes while giving a candidate interview, which causes her to lose her job
 unhone kaha ki vah appal or intuit main recruiter or echaar agjicutive rah chukin hai
 Where he interviewed more than 6,000 people
 jab bos kaa chillaanaa ban jaae daily routine, to yun rakhen khud ko kooljaane kya he wo galtiyannermi se pesh naa anarechal bite ne kahaan ki intervyuu ke dauraan candidet kaa bihaviour naram nahin hota
 He said that after the phone interview, a candidate was called to the breakfast for the second round
 lekin jis tarah usne hotel ke staff ke saath bihev kiya usase saaf pataa chal gaya ki vah insaan kaisaa he
 He says that whenever a candidate comes to give an interview, he should be gentle
 aapke bure bartaav se naukari to nahin milegi saath hi aapke image par bhi sawaal khadey ho sakate hai
 When the team gives good performance, then boost the team in this way
 
 
 sawaal na puchhanounhone kaha ki aap ek nai company main naukari ke liye intervyuu dene ja rahe hai, or company se sambandhit koi sawaal nahin poochhate hai to iskaa bhi galat impresssont padataa he

 unka kahana he ki candidet jis bhi company main intervyuu dene ja rahe hai uske bare main research karke jaaen
 So that you can answer the questions related to the company from the recruiter
 ek cheez kaa hameshaa khyaal rakhen ki jab bhi aap koi atapata or logical sawaal poochhate hai to koi bhi aapako bevakoof nahin samajhegaa

 ishrat jahaan encounter maamle se judi gum filon kii khoj ke liye gathit jaanch team ne apni report grih sachiv rajeev maharishi ko saunp diya he
 According to the Home Ministry sources, only one document has been found from the files which are missing, the rest is not known yet
 report par ab kya kadam uthaanaa he us par grih sachiv ko faisla lenaa he
 52-page investigation report, in fact, Additional Secretary BK Prasadgum was investigating the files
 52 pannon ke is main report main keval ek file milane kaa zikr he, jo file mili he wo tatkaaleen atorni general jeei vaahnavati se judi he
 During the preparation of the report, the investigation team questioned the people of 11 offices connected to it
 shaq ke daayre main grih mantralay se jude logrepart kii maane to ishrat jahaan muthbhed se judi 18 se 28 sitambar 2009 ke bich kii filein gaayab hai or us vakt pi chidambaram kendriya grih mantri the
 According to the investigation team, a total of 6 draft papers are missing
 report kii maane to filon kojaanboojhkargum karaayaa gaya or shaq ke daayre main grih mantralay se jude log hai
 Rajnath had made mention of the files being lost in the Parliament
 It is worth mentioning that the Ministry of Home Affairs had formed a member committee to trace the files
 10 march ko sansad main grih mantri rajnath singh ne khulaasa kiya tha ki ishrat jahaan maamle kii ahm filein gaayab hai
 a member inquiry panel was then formed
 pachaas saal ke amit anilchandra shah kal bijepi ke nae adhyaksh ban jaaenge
 His name will be stamped at the parliamentary board meeting at 12 noon at the party headquarters
 uske kuch hi der baad unke naam kaa aupchaarik elaan bhi kar diya jayega
 Later this month or early next month, Shah will also announce his new team, which is obviously going to be very young
 ye ek badali bijepi kii tasviir hogi
 While approving Amit Shah's name, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has been thinking that after the party comes to power, the organization does not get loose, so it needs an active president to keep it dynamic
 amit shah is role main bilkul feet baithte hai, kyonki sirf nau maheenon main uttar pradesh main narendra modi ke naam ke sahare unhone bijepi kaa ab tak kaa sabase behtareen pradarshan karke dikhaaya he
 BJP has won 73 seats out of 80 in the state with its own and ally Apna Dal
 unhen isi kaa paarishramik milane ja rahaa he
 Some of the party leaders had these questions in their mind that would it be right to have the Prime Minister and the party president from Gujarat? But it was later decided that it would not be appropriate to ignore Shah's claim simply because both he and the Prime Minister hail from Gujarat
 ye sawaal bhi puche gaye ki shah ke khilaaf soharabuddin kii farji muthbhed kaa maamla chal rahaa he or aise main kya unhen bijepi adhyaksh bananaa thik hoga
 But in response to this, it was argued that the party has always considered the matter to be politically motivated, so it should not have political implications
 kuch netaaon ne laal krishna adwani kaa bhi udhaaharan diya, jinhone hawala cond main naam aane ke baad lok sabha se istipha de diya tha magar party adhyaksh bane rahe the
 The main reason for giving this responsibility to Amit Shah is believed to be his ability to take quick decisions, his grip on the organization and the open support of Prime Minister Narendra Modi behind him
 darasal, bijepi main ye mana jaataa rahaa he ki atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar ke vakt kuch aise adhyaksh rahe jo apekshaaon par khare nahin utar sake
 For this, the names of Bangaru Laxman and k Janakrishnamurthy are particularly taken
 lekin is baat par aam raay he ki kushabhau thakare jaise kaddavar netaa ke adhyaksh rahete samay na sirf sanghathan ne gati pakadi balki sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par bhi tikhi nazaren lagi raheen
 Popularly known as 'nishkam Karmayogi', Thackeray is remembered as a strict, disciplinarian and a hold on the organization
 kuch masalon par party adhyaksh rahete hue unhone tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi se bhi sawaal-jawaab kiye the
 Now that the BJP has got a majority ruling on its own, the question was what kind of president the party wants
 isiilie amit shah ke kaamkaaj par sabaki nazaren lagi rahengi
 There is every possibility that the BJP will contest the next Lok Sabha elections under his leadership
 agle kuch maheenon main hone ja rahe maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke nattejey unki safal ranneetikaar kii chhavi kii agali pariksha honge
 Along with this, it will also be seen to what extent he will be able to establish a synergy between the government and the organization
 sawaal ye bhi he ki kya amit shah ke rup main bijepi kii agle kushabhau thakare kii talash puri ho paaegi? Hindustan is completely dyed in electoral color
 har koi raajnneetik bayaanbaji kar rahaa he or jodtod kaa kaam bhi jari he
 Some political party is joining, then some party is changing
 phir chaahe koi cricket kaa khilaadi ho yaa phir bollywood kaa star
 Social media is playing an important role in fueling political rhetoric
 saarvajanik rup se apni baat rakhane ke liye sabhi soshal media kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 Everyone has their own ideology and political outlook

 par pichley hafte yahaan assam se, maa ke saath ai ek navayuvati apane pasandida lekhak ruskin bond se milane kii jaddojahad main udhaas or pareshaan thi
 After wandering all day, in the evening when she arrived at Bond's Ivy Cottage in Bond, a small tranquil hamlet that had turned into a heritage, her tears were not coming to an end
 maa ne pair pakad liye
 One of his novels changed the life of this desperate woman
 par bhavatirek unhen asahaj kar detaa he
 The next evening he says, "you won't find lazy in the world like me
" or sone ko to abhi kahie, abhi so jaaun
 On May 19, India's famous narrator Ruskin Bond is turning 85
 par yah sikh unhone lekhak ke rup main sangharsh karte hue hi paa lee thi ki apane ko bahut gambhirtha se nahin lenaa he
 You can feel it constantly while being near them
 kursi par peeche tikkar batiyate hue ve saamne teble par rakhi kitaab kii ore ishaara karte hai
 Recently it is a Kannada translation of one of his story collections
 ''kannada vaale log mujhe ruskin bonda kehete hai, aalu-bondawala
 By saying this, he also blossoms himself, in a child-friendly manner
 naam ke saath 'chhedchhad' ke do or vaake ve isi tarah se bayaan karte hai
 In one place, one of his readers in Mussoorie addressed him Bunkin Rand
 or unke parivaar se judi ek punjabi mahila unhen rakson bulaati thim
 Meanwhile he unveils the Hindi translation of his four books of the Rusty series from Rajpal & Sons
 apni aatmakatha main bhi unhone angootha chusane, enema lagane ke liye peechha karatin nani se khauf khaane or aksar goochad-gachad kapade pahanane jaise byore dilachasp andaaj main die hai
 Bond, the son of an English father and anglo-indian mother, author of about 500 stories and 6‚Äì7 novels, while living in England for some time in the fifties, he realized that he could be nothing but a Hindustani
 kasauli main janme, shimla main padhe or 1964 main musuri aakar bas jane ke baad to yahaan kii aabhohawaa unki ragon main samaa gai
 For the past 9-10 years, they visit the Oxford Book Depot in Mussoorie every Saturday and meet the readers for an hour

 There is also a black statue of Dhyanastha Buddha, but if you look at the quiet, deep green valley below for some time, then meditation itself
 pichley hafte senior assistant editor shivakesh se unhone lambii baat kii
 Their answers were in English, except for a few sentences (which have been reduced to italics)
 aap bhi padhein:haal ke varshon main aapke kai kahani sangrah or upanyaas hindi main aa chuke hai
 Your autobiography Lone Fox Dancing is also being translated
 pehle kya hindi prakashkon ne ruchi nahin dikhaai thi yaa aapane dilchaspee nahin lee?saath-sattar ke dashak main angreji main hi meri kitaaben nahin bik rahi thim to hindi prakaashak bhala kyon dilchaspee letaa? bombai ke india book house (un dinon ke charchit prakaashak) se chhapi 3-4 ru
 People were not buying books, so why would anyone be interested in the translation of my book? That is why in those days i was writing in newspapers and magazines that at least Pachasek was Rs
 to mil jaaen
 So, is there any kind of dialogue with Hindi readers now? Thora-lot, not much
 vaise bhi musuri or dehradun main bukshop vaale hindi kitaaben aksar rakhte nahin
 For this, one has to go inside the platoon market in Dehradun
 pichley saal bhopal, indore or raipur pravaas main jarur mujhe, meri hindi kitabon ke yuva pathak mili
 But here booksellers are interested in selling English books only
 ek vyapaaree to mahangi kitaaben hi bechnaa chahega, or hindi kii kitaaben angreji se sasti hoti hai
 During the school days in Shimla, Mohan Rakesh has taught Hindi to you
 haa, class main main hindi main sabase ladend tha
 He used to tell me something in Hindi, on which the whole class used to laugh
 ek baar unki (shaayad pehali) patni ne mujhase shikaayat kii ki main hindustan main rahata hum or meri hindi itani kharaab he! main kaha, kya karun, aapke patidev ne hi padhaayaa he (hansate hai)
 On May 19, you will become 85 years old
 agle janmdin kii purvasandhya par peeche najar daalate hai to kya dekhte hai?jindagi main aaj jitna santosh or sukun he, pehle kabhi nahin tha
 Today i have a readership, books are sold, royalty is also earning some income
 us myne main ek lihaaj se main charam par pahunch gaya hum
 The children of the adopted family also grow up doing something
 tachwood sehat bhi thik he
 Physical as well as mental
 jindagi kii is ghadi main log amuman baithkar apane kiye kaa hisaab karte hai
 But seeing you, it seems that more characters have been saved than you have created
 yah sach he
 The older you are, the more you have to look back
 maine bahut adventuras life to nahin ji, lekin haa, ek lekhak vaali jindagi mujhe jarur mili
 And one advantage of staying on the hill is that by looking at the world from above, you get a view and an understanding of it
 duusare, dhire-dhire main kudarat ke kareeb hota gaya hum, yah prakriya mere yahaan (landhor, musuri) basane ke baad shuru hui
 Stayed in Delhi for 4-5 years but escaped from there

 Rusty (the character of his autobiographical series) first ran away from home, then from school, then fled to England, ran from there, then ran and climbed the hill
 aglaa thikaana? parvat (hansate hai)
 Well, now Bhagam Bhag has stopped
 aapke kirdaar or unke aasapaas ke ditels ke saath hi unka realism kamaal kaa hota he
 You have also done plays and read classic dramas
 aapako lagata he, theatre kaa craft, gahare objarveshan vaale kisi lekhak ko koi kissa khadaa karne main madad karata he?dekhie, craft kii ahmiyat apni jagah he
 But i think it is not enough to write a sentence, it has to be created
 shabdon ko alag dhang se baratna, unhen zyada dilachasp bananaa hota he
 It started happening in my youth, when i was studying a lot
 apni alahada style rakhane vaale lekhak mujhe bahut bhaate the
 The style of an author should be identified separately
 to craft ahm he par likhnaa sikh lenaa hi kaaphi nahin
 People often ask me, "is a writer born or coined?" In my case, i would say that i was a born writer
 5-6 kii umr main bhi main kuch na kuch likhata rahata tha
 But as you move forward, you have to keep working on your stylus
 isamen aap lagaataar sikhte hai
 My favorite book is the thick-legged Oxford English Dictionary See it, here it lies (pointing to the table of books in front)
 shabdon ke arth, unki utpatti or unke safar ke bare main jaanane ko lekar aaj bhi mujhamen utana hi romaanch rahata he
 Basicly i am a fiction writer
 lekin fiction ko maine aatmakatha or nijee lekhan se joda he
 i started with essays, then started stories, also wrote poems
 yani har vidha main likhaa
 Yes, i could not write the play
 vajahah marathi or bangla ko chhod den to hindustan main angreji naatakon kaa manch kahaan he? angreji bhashaa kaa naatakkaar banane ke liye aapako neuyork yaa landan main rahanaa hoga
 You wrote autobiography after passing the age of eighty
 sansmaran to likhata aayaa tha
 The autobiography came two-one years ago
 usamen bhi bahut haal ke samay ke byore nahin hai kyonki phir vahi baat, main baton ko ek persepective, ek pariprekshya main rakhana pasand karata hum
 And it is easier to keep things in perspective than events far away from the very near past
 so yah aatmakatha 50-60 tak kii umr ke byoron ko samete he
 But what is the secret of such a sharp and deep memory in this age? i remember the names of the entire cast of films seen in those days
 khaas lekhakon kii sari kitabon ke naam bade aaraam se gina saktaa hum
 i can give details of the people i met during my very childhood days, even the events of that time, even if i have no connection with them
 meri acchhee yaaddaasht mere rachanakarm main khaasi madadgaar rahi he
 Nobody forgets anything or keeps their manuscripts here and there
 aapako musuri main rahete kai dashak ho gaye
 What changes have you seen here during this time? Life is still difficult for the people here
 jo thodaa pard gaye, ve fouj main chale jate hai or noujvaan dilli, dehradun yaa or kisi shahar kaa rasta pakad lete hai
 This is the condition of the entire hilly region
 gaanvon main jaaie to aapako buudhe-bujurg hi milenge
 This is a tragic situation
 jahaan tak musuri kii baat he, to desh main pichley pachaasek saal main middle class teji se samrudh hua he
 So not only Mussoorie and Shimla, who have a lot of money, they now look at it with great eyesight
 ve malaysia or honkong jate hai
 Science and technology have also made the journey easier
 par hairat he ki deshon kii simaaen duruh hoti ja rahi hai
 People have become more aware of boundaries
 ham travel karne main to zyada sakasham ho gaye lekin ab utane hi zyada vija chahie
 Before the First World War, there was no visa
 passport kii avadharana usee vakt ai, varanaa aap kahin bhi chale jaaie
 Big filmmakers like Vishal Bhardwaj (the Blue Umbrella and Saat Khoon Maaf) and Shyam Benegal (junoon) made films on your stories, yet why did you not inspire to write more scripts for cinema? Writing scripts for me was very boring
 Work
 maine saat khun maaf ke liye kahani ko badhaakar screenple banaaya tha lekin aakhir main unhone puraa badal daalaa
 But if a good director likes a story of mine and wants to make a film on it, then i will be happy
 main khushi-khushi use adhikaar duungaa, jis tarah se vishaal ko or shashi kapur ko junun ke liye diya tha, jo ki 1857 kii prishthbhumi kii kahani a flite of pigence par bani thi
 Vishal has another story for me
 ab yah pataa nahin ki ve us par film kab banaaenge
 Apart from this, some of my ghost stories are being brought to Netflix Digital Films these days, which you can also watch on your mobile
 par main nahin dekhne vaala
 i am not even interested in this (digital) medium
 haalanki meri fees dekar meri kahaniyon ko le jane vaale khush hai
 If i do not have to use technology, i do not have any problem with it
 aapaki lav stories zyaadaatar dukhaant vaali rahi hai
 Why this? At the age of twenty i wrote many stories with romantic flavors because that was my romantic period
 masalan nite train ait devli, time stops ait shamali
 i had frequent romances in those days, often one-sided
 tabhi kahaniyaan bhi dukhaant vaali thim
 But just last week, i wrote a new story called The Garden of Dreams, which has Sukhant
 isamen main jiske ishk main padataa hum, vah phir saath hi aa jaati he
 Laughter all around
 kyonki yah mahaj ek khwab he
 But i thought, let's write a love story then a happy one
 haalanki ise bhi maine dur kathmando kii prishthbhumi par likhaa he (hansate hue)
 Don't you think you have underplayed the personality of you and your writer? See, i was writing a lot in the fifties, sixties and seventies, but didn't get much recognition
 aise main khud ko koi khaas lekhak maanane kaa mujhe chaska bhi nahin laga
 This has increased my readership in the last 15-20 years
 kuch kahaniyaan skool-college paathyakramon main shaamil hone se yuva pathakon ne janaa he
 One day a letter from a reader came that he has 90 of my books, that is, almost all of them
 acha hua ki kamyaabi bahut jaldi nahin mili
 Had it been found early, i probably would not have cared so much and would have lost it
 or kabhi-kabhi agar aap zyada kaamyaab ho jaaen to devataaon ko jalan hone lagati he
 They hit the cage and make you hide
 to kamyaabi dhire-dhire hi aae to acha
 You have not been religious, but nowadays religion is speaking with great head
 is maahaul par kya kahenge?yah vishwavyaapee ghatana he
 Khasi is a period of powerlessness, sadness and disintegration
 aise main bahut-se logon kaa najariya sankeern ho gaya he
 i am not a religious or spiritual person
 aap mujhe kaaman sens vaala aadmi kah sakate hai
 But i favor the rights of anyone, religion, worship and faith unless i am forced to do so
 par manushya jivan ke jivan ke itihaas main is tarah ke daur aate-jate rahete hai
 This is a small part of the same cycle
