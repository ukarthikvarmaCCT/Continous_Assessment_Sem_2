 bijepi main to hanuman kii jati or dharm ko bataane kii hode si much gai
 Now Yogi Adityanath's Sports and Youth Welfare Minister Chetan Chauhan has described Hanuman as a player
 unhone apane is daawey ke samarthan main daleel bhi di he
 In Amroha, he said, 'hanuman ji used to fight wrestling and was also a player
 jitne bhi pahalwaan log hai, unki puja karte hai
 i consider them the same
 wo hamaare isht hai
 God has no caste
 main unako jati main nahin baantnaa chahta
 'chetan Chauhan is also the former cricketer before the cabinet minister in the Yogi government
 UP Min & Former India cricketer Chetan Chauhan in Amroha yesterday: Hanuman ji kushti ladte the, khiladi bhi the, jitne bhi pehlwan log hain unki pooja karte hain, main unko wahi manta hun, humare isht hain, bhagwan ki koi jaati nahi hoti

 Whereas Baba Ramdev said that Hanuman is knowledgeable of Ashta Siddhi as well as Kshatriya

 is seshan main bengali abhinayta dhritiman chatarji, filmmekar vivek agnihotri, filmkaar anik datta or kamedian anuvab paal ne shirkat kii
 The session was conducted by Padmaja Joshi
 is dauraan kamedian anuvab paal ne padmavati maamle main kataaksh karte hue kaha, sensor board ke saath samasya ye he ki uske paas apni army nahin he
 He needs the army to face opposition
 vah abhi police kaa sahaara leti he
 In India, there are different views on every matter
 anik datta ne kaha, mujhe aashcharya hota ki yadi is film par tab itnaa hangaamaa hota, jab ye desh ke kisi khaas kshetra main bani hoti
 Actors are also not stars
 kala ko har samay main alag tarah se paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 So-called censorship has been around for a long time
 mujhe nahin lagata ki hamaara desh hi is list main akelaa he
 This issue is very ridiculous
 freedom vah he, jo aap paribhaashit kar rahe hai
 Also read: Glimpses of the first day of India Today Conclave East 2017
dhritiman Chatterjee said during this, Padmavati is a non-issue, but today everyone is discussing it
 maine sanjay lila bhansaali ke saath kiya he, vah kaaphi samarpit or mehnatee filmkaar hai, kaaphi baarikiyon par kaam karte hai, mujhe nahin lagata ki sanjay lila bhansaali jaanboojhkar aisa kuch karenge jisase logon kii bhaavana ko chot pahunche
 Those who are talking about getting hurt on the sentiment, they have not seen the film yet
 vivek agnihotri ne kaha, padmavati jaise mudde kaa phayda har koi uthaanaa chahta he
 Everyone is benefiting from this
 rajaneta, rajput samaaj, media sab ise apane-apane tareeke se bhunaa rahe hai
 But the question is that the film has not yet come to the censor board, then why there is so much ruckus
 iskaa lanbaa itihaas he
 'kissa Kursi Ka', Madhur Bhandarkar's Indu Sarkar and other films also fell victim to such protests
 logon ko iske khilaaf aawaaj uthaanaa chahie
 Karan Johar is Narendra Modi of the industry, he should speak
 jis padmavati par bavaal, use dekhne vaale ne bataai 4 aapattiyon kii sacchaiis desh main har din kisi na kisi ko putala jal rahaa he
 Narendra Modi is burnt in one way and Rahul Gandhi on the other
 darasal, mudda padmavati nahin he, mudda he allaudin khilji
 People are worried that Alauddin Khilji is being glorified in the film
 samasya ye he ki hamen galat itihaas padhaayaa gaya he
 During my film research, i found that 90 percent people said that they were taught wrong history
 dhritiman chatarji ne yadi itihaas ko dekha jaae vivek agnihotri kii film buddha in treffic jam ko bhi yah kar bain kiya ja saktaa tha ki buddha kabhi treffic jam main nahin rahe
 On this Agnihotri said, his film is banned
 jadhavpur uniwarsity ke chaatro ne unhen bulaayaa tha ki ve apni film kaa unirvity main pradarshan karen
 During this time, there was so much opposition to his film, he broke his car, broke his shoulder and injured him
 yahaan tak ki college ke register ne bhi iskaa virodh kiya
 Said that they are showing the leftists wrongly in the film
 bhansaali kii padmavati ko britain ne paas kiya, par relies nahin karnaa chaahate hai nirmaataadhritiman ne is dibet main kaha ki samasya yah he ki hamaare yahaan aise maamle main dand kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 The removal of the film s Durga from the Goa Film Festival is also a result of this
 kisi ko adhikaar nahin ki film ko screening se rokane kaa

 uttar pradesh ke gorakhpur se bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke ummidavaar ravi kishan ne loksabhaa chunaav ke liye nayaa naaraa diya he
 He directly attacked the SP-BSP and Congress with his slogan and appealed to BJP to vote
 ravi kishan ne kaha ki na panja par, na cycle par, na jaat par na paat par, na hathi, seenaa thok kar vot dehi bhaiya chappan inch ke chaati par
 It is clear from Ravi Kishan's slogan that he has appealed people not to vote for Congress, Samajwadi Party as well as Bahujan Samaj Party
 ravi kishan ke naare main bhojpuri ke shabdon kaa bhi istemaal kiya gaya he
 He said that on the chest of fifty six inches, vote chest
 iskaa matlab hua ki shaan se chappan inch ke chaati par hi vot dena he
 By using the word Bhojpuri in the slogan, it is clear that they are seeking to increase their close proximity with the voters of Gorakhpur
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav ke liye bijepi ne sabhi ko hairaan karte hue gorakhpur se ravi kishan ko tikat diya he
 Earlier there was such a discussion that BJP can give ticket to sitting MP Pravin Nishad from here, but the party has put a Brahmin candidate from here by putting a stop to all those discussions
 ravi kishan kaa ajam khan par nishaanaa2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jonpur se congress ke tikat par chunaav lard chuke ravi kishan ne samaajawaadee party ke netaa ajam khan dwaara jaya pradaa par die bayaan par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 He said how objectionable statements are being made on women
 jaya pradaa hamaari industry main kaaphi varisht hai
 We all respect him
 sirf isliye ki vah chunaav ladane ke liye rampur ai hai, aap un par tippanee karenge? chunaav ke dauraan garima banaae rakhi jaani chahie
 Explain that SP candidate from Rampur Lok Sabha seat Azam Khan made an objectionable statement without taking the name of Jaya Prada
 Ravi Kishan, BJP candidate from Gorakhpur: What derogatory comments are being made on women! Jaya Prada ji is a sr in our industry, we respect her a lot
 Just because she has come to Rampur to contest elections you will comment on her? Dignity should be maintained during electionpic

 gujarat ke mukhyamantri or aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii ore se piem pad ke sambhavit ummidavaaranarendra modipar jediu ke hamale se bijepi tilamilaati najar aa rahi he
 The BJP rejected the remarks made against Modi and said that no one should comment on the working style of his Chief Ministers
 narendra modi ke khilaaf jediu kii tippaniyon ko khaarij karte hue bijepi gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke peeche dridhtaa se khadi najar ai
 He said that no 'baseless conclusion' should be drawn against Modi
 'niraadhaar nishkarsh na nikaalen sahyogi'party pravaktaa nirmala sitaraman ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘ham narendra modi ke khilaaf sabhi niraadhaar nishkarsh ko khaarij karte hai
 He said that it is unfortunate that the allies are focusing their energies on the BJP chief ministers and focusing less on the fight to oust the UPA
 ’'upie sarkaar ko hataane par lagaaein dhyaan'jediu netaa nitish kumaar kaa naam liye bina unhone kaha ki bijepi ummid karti he ki sahyogi dal apana dhyaan mukhya rup se upie nit ‘nakaaree or bhrasht’ sarkaar ko hataane par kendrit karenge jo desh ko har kshetra main neeche kii ore le ja rahi he
 He said, 'BJP hopes that opposition parties and allies will focus their attention mainly on it
 haalanki, yah durbhagyapurna he ki ve apni urja mukhyamantriyon par kendrit kar rahe hai or upie ko hataane par dhyaan kam de rahe hai
 The bjp's 8-month-old Mohlatbihar Chief Minister and his party JDU, objecting to Modi's name, gave the BJP eight months to declare the Prime Ministerial candidate for the upcoming general elections
 saath hi kaha tha ki aisa vyakti pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar hona chahie jisaki dharmanirpekshata par koi andeh na ho
 jdu's reaction to Modi's severe comment came soon after that
 jediu ne shanivaar ko modi kii aalochana karte hue kaha tha, ‘ve 2002 main gujarat ke sampradayik dangon par roak lagane main rajya ke mukhiya ke taur par apane kartavyon kaa nirvahan karne main vifal rahe
 The party said in a political resolution in its national council meeting on Sunday that the candidate for the post of prime minister should be like Atalji otherwise it would have negative consequences
 nitish ne lagaataar vikaas ke gujarat model kaa ullekh karne ke liye bhi modi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 The bjp's latest comment came when the political resolution passed in the JDU National Council clarified that the prime ministerial candidate should be such that his secular image is beyond doubt in the country, which favors inclusive development and backward classes and It is the advocacy to take the fields and all along, its credibility should be like Atal Bihari Vajpayee, otherwise it will have negative consequences
 nitish ke usul 'atal', uchhaali modi kii 'topi'narendra modi ke liye ek tarah se daravaaje band karne ke baad jediu ne endie ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke liye atal bihari vaajapeyi jaisi dharmanirpeksh saakh vaale vyakti par jor diya
 The JDU also hinted at agreeing on the name of senior BJP leader LK Advani
 jediu netaa devesh chandra thakur ne kaha, ‘endie pehle laalkrishna adwani ke netritv main chunaav lard chukaa he
 i do not think there should be any problem in going to the elections under his leadership
 adwani nishchit taur par endie ke ghatakon ko adhik sweekaarya hai
 'narendra Modi attacked Nitish' hat bomb 'thakur said that the two-day meeting of jdu's National Executive and National Council has emphasized a person with credibility like Vajpayee as nda's prime ministerial candidate
 yah puche jane par ki bijepi main koun aisa vyakti he jo vaajapeyi ke vyaktitv ke kareeb he yaa jediu is pad ke liye adwani kaa paksh legi, party pravaktaa evam mahasachiv ke si tyaagi ne kaha, ‘ham isse pehle bhi adwani ke netritv main chunaav lard chuke hai, isliye ham apane pehle ke nirnay ko kaise galat tehra sakate hai
 Another JDU leader and Bihar minister Narendra Singh said that Modi comes in sixth or seventh position in bjp's seniority list
 ‘ agar varishthata par bhi vichaar karen tab bhi vah adwani se kaaphi neeche aate hai
 Seeking to declare the nda's prime ministerial candidate ahead of the general elections, the jdu's political proposal states that the BJP should declare its prime ministerial candidate by the end of this year and the candidate should be one who has a secular image and Who can take everyone along
 aam chunaav se pehle endie ke pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karne ke paksh main daleel dete hue jediu ke rajnatik prastaav main kaha gaya he ki bijepi ne 1999 or 2004 ke chunaav se pehle atalji kaa naam or 2009 ke chunaav se pehle laalkrishna adwani kaa naam ghoshit kiya tha
 However, the JDU spokesperson said, 'sheikh Abdullah's grandson was also included in Vajpayee's government
 ham aisa pradhanmantri chaahate hai
 No one can be greater than Vajpayee
 ’rajnath singh or arun jetali ke saath kal nitish kumaar kii baithak ke bare main puche jane par tyaagi ne kaha ki jetali ne unase kaha ki ve is vishay par aapas main baithkar charchaa karenge
 He said, 'some things have been said indirectly

 The torrential rain of the evening and the time of leaving office halted the pace of Delhi on Friday
 jagah jagah trephic jam se log ghanto pareshaan rahe
 Coming to Noida from Kalindi Kunj, the jam at many places including Sarai Kale Khan Road and ISBT Karnal Road, made the people suffer
 faridabad se dilli aa rahe log kareeb 2 ghante takzam main fancerhe
 The traffic police on ISBT Karnal Road was doing traffic control by itself
 aise main donon taraf ke trephic ko baari baari se move karke gaadiyaan nikaali gayi
 The situation was the same on Sarai Kale Khan
 sadakonpar trephic rang rahaa tha, log ghanto ek hi jagah par fanse rahe
 The speed of the capital stopped in the rain as if people would not be able to reach home
 ek ambulance bahut der tak kalindi kunj se noida ke jam main fansi rahi
 After a long time the traffic police somehow made way for the ambulance
 rajdhanidellimein jaraa si barish ke baad jagah-jagah jalairao or kharaab raaston kii vajah se logon ko baari trephic se jujhna padataa he
 Road accident, non-willful murder, fame, years of waiting, punishment and Salman in the midst of it all
 6 may 2015 se lekar 8 may 2015 tak mumbai kii sadakon, kashmir kii vaadiyon, varanasi kii galiyon, lakhanu ke bagichon or patna ke muhallon main sirf ek hi charchaa rahi-salmaan ko sajaa
 It is interesting that when the verdict was awaited from the victim to the entire country for 13 years, the blessings of the devotees rose for joy over the arrival of him
 aap chahen to naitikta, samanta, kanoon vyavastha or aise hi adarshavaadi shabdon ke ird-girdsavaalon par charchaaor bahes kar sakate hai, lekin inamen ek dwandv bhi pal rahaa he
 In fact, between Tuesday and Friday, what happened in Mumbai's sessions court and the Bombay High Court, located 2 minutes away from it, scrutinizes the questions raised by the road 13 years ago
 lekin maujuuda samay main usee sadak par swaroop lete un sawaalon ko kinaaraa kar detaa he, jin par charchaa jaruri he
 The question is, is it right and just to punish the guilty? The question is, should the verdict be given only in view of the evidence and pleadings, or should it also be taken by those who suffer and suffer that decision? The question is also that exercise like self-regulation and improvement should be noticed, because the real purpose of the law is reform, not punishment? And the question is whether in such a situation, any criminal should not be punished for improving with time, because now he has become a social worker and he is welfare of many people
 
 
 kyonki 'banaam' ab rah nahin gayasal 2002 ke jis hit and ran maamle main salmaan khan ko 5 saal kaid kii sajaa sunai gai he, usamen peediton kii sankhya bhi 5 he
 13 years have passed since the case
 ek dashak se bhi adhik samay main is darmyaan kaaphi kuch badal gaya he
 Salman's status has changed
 phens kaa pyaar paagalpan main tabdeel ho gaya he or peediton kaa gussa, dard se aage badhkar jindagi kii uljhan ko sulajhane main laga hua he
 When Salman got relief from the High Court on Friday, hearing what Abdullah and Kalim said to the victims, it cannot be carried forward
 abdulla ne kaha, 'salmaan ko jamaanat mili he or ye acha hi he
 'you can also name it generously, but in this' good is' the scars on the burden of life are visible, who instead of punishing the guilty demand compensation for themselves
 
 
 
 So what should be done, but other aggrieved families are also not very happy with the court moving Sasalman
 sajaa kii bajaay muaavja prathimakata ban gai he
 The victim Mohammed Kaleem even says that it will be good for the convict to punish him
 muaavja miltaa to jindagi kii gaadi patari par aa jaati
 He also describes himself as a fan of Salman
 yah dilachasp bhi he or dukhad bhi
 Interestingly, because the victim himself is talking about exemption from conviction, the sad fact is that 'punishment for guilty' is the priority for our law
 kanoon apni jagah sahi he, kyonki isse vyavastha bani rahati he or aapraadhik maansikta waalon main bhay bhi bana rahata he
 But from this also the duality arises for whom and whether the law should not be expected to improve the standard of living which the family of the victims has been doing
 'salmaan' kaa karnaa kya chahiesalmaan doshi qaraar die gaye to unke parivaar samet karodon phens par jaise sitam ho gaya
 Jumma turned into a party when he got bail
 pataakhe chale, mithaiyaan banty
 Outside Salman's house, crowds gathered in the court premises and on the streets, as if God is not the Abhineta
 ek mahashay ne to court ke aadesh ke intjaar main jehar tak kha liya, jabaki uske khud ke do chote-chote bachche hai
 Seekers argue that Salman is generous, helps people, is good for everyone, so he should get forgiveness
 iskaa arth yah hua ki kal ko agar koi or apradhi samajaseva karne lage
 Change your mind, if serious, should he also get forgiveness instead of punishment
 asal main yah aisa sawaal he, jiskaa shaayad hi koi salmaan fain jawaab dena chahega
 But this is democracy and the crowd cannot be sidelined here
 khaskar tab jab bheed phens se zyada bhakt ho kyonki is desh kii kasautidharm ke ird-girdki kasi gai he
 In the system of law, the judiciary has been placed at the top
 kanoon kii kitabon main sabhi ke liye 'samaan' adhikaron kii baat kii gai he, lekin vyavhaarik taur par aisa he nahin or ise sabit karne ke liye bahes kii jarurat bhi nahin he
 According to a media report, Justice Thipsay himself, whose court heard Salman's case on Friday, is still handling 1993 cases on his bench, while Salman's case was immediately heard
 kanoon banaaya gaya taaki aparaadhiyon ko sajaa mil sake or peedit ko nyaay mili
 But loop holes were also left in the same law, taking advantage of which big law contractors (lawyers) are becoming millionaires and millionaires
 ek ore mukesh ambani hai jo gas vivaad jaise cese main sirf vakil ke liye 15 karod kharch kar dete hai, vahiin duusari ore kai aise kisaan bhi hai jo jameen ke maamuli vivaad main ek vakil tak nahin kar pate
 Overall, if we look at the maximum arguments, problems, circumstances and the system on this side, more questions emerge than answers
 or jab sawaalon kaa guchha badal banane lagata he to gallexi apartment kii balkoni main salmaan kaa cheharaa najar aata he
 The face that thanks, obliges and thanks the love of the fans
 lekin haath jodakar man ke andar kisi kone main samaae maayusi or sadame ko dhakne kii koshish bhi karata he
 There is a group of crazy people in front
 pataakhe kii ladi he or becoground se koi cheekh rahaa he- justice delayed is justice denied

 jai lakshmi mata, Maiya Jai laxmi Mata tumko nisadin sevat, Har Vishnu Vidhata 4 gabbar! team india main shikhar dhawan ko isi naam se bulaayaa jaataa he
 Perhaps it is the effect of his mustache or his love for the film 'sholay'
 magar, itnaa to tay he ki chayankarta ab shikhar se sawaal poochne lage hai ki ' tera kya hoga gabbar?' How long will you stay in the team on the strength of that stormy first innings against Australia? Shikhar has scored at an average of 27 in nine Test matches in the last one year, which questions his place in the team
 lekin, unki kismat acchhee he ki vanade cricket main unka balla kuch had tak chalata rahaa he
 And less people nowadays see cricket in white and colored clothes separately
 aisa nahin ki shikhar kii takanic main achaanak kami aa gai
 He is playing like he used to play before
 tii20 or vanade kaa asar kisi kii ballebaazi par kya hota he, shikhar iskaa behtareen udhaaharan he
 Taking advantage of the fielders' placement and flat pitches in odis, he bats aggressively from the beginning of the innings
 lekin, test main jab kisi over main lagaataar un par dabaav banaaya jaataa he, jab unke ran bananaa band ho jate hai to wo ekaagratha kho bathte hai
 If one has to play maiden over, restlessness in their gestures is clearly visible
 test khelnaa apane aap main ek alag kala he, jahaan takanic ke saath-saath maansik rup se bhi aap kasuti par hote hai
 Looking at the form and performance of Shikhar, it seems that if the runs are not scored in the next innings, then young Rahul Lokesh should keep his pads ready
 sholay film kaa dialog yaad aata he, " gabbar ke taap se ek hi aadmi bachaa saktaa he, khud gabbar
 " bharat or pakistan ke halaat par minurity afares ministar mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne 'ajtak' se baatcheet kii he
 Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has said that our army is ready to give a befitting reply to the terrorists

 Is India in a transcendental mood? Naqvi - the force that is the enemy of humanity, the enemy of peace
 aisi takaton komunhtod javabdena bahut jaruri tha
 We salute the army which has been able to give a befitting reply to the terrorists
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main desh puri tarah se majboot haathon main he
 Those who try to harm the security and peace of the country will be given a befitting reply

 Pakistan says that no such surgical strikes have taken place
 jo bharat daawa kar rahaa he?nakvi-yah to uski puraani or swabhaavik aadat he
 He is a traditional professional criminal of terrorism
 profeshnal aatankwadake gunaahagaar ko aisi baat karte hue aap dekh or sun sakate hai hameshaa
 Question- Can India take such action even further? Naqvi - Our security force, our government is fully committed to the country's honor, country's self-respect and security

 welcome ofer, hapi new year ofer, jeeyo prime, sarprise ofer ke baad ab 'dhan dhana dhan ofer' launch kar diya gaya he
 Recently TRAI asked Reliance Jio to withdraw the three-month surprise offer
 iske baad company ne ise waapas liya, lekin kuch dinon isaki sabsakripshan chaalu rakhi
 Now Jio has now launched Dhan Dhana Dhan Offer
 is ofer ke tahat die jane vaale tarriff par gaur karenge to aap paaenge ki company ne samar sarprise ko dhan dhana dhan ke naam se pesh kar diya he
 The benefit of this offer will be available only to those who have not subscribed to Jio Summer Surprise
 lekin yah ofer un logon ke liye bhi he jo jeeyo prime yujar nahin he
 Meaning the company wants to convert all Jio customers to Jio Prime
 kya TRAI ise bhi waapas lene ko kahegaa?chunki dhan dhana dhan ofer bhi sarprise ofer jaisaa hi he, isliye ab sawaal yah he ki kya TRAI ise bhi waapas lene ko kahegaa? kyonki airtel isapar aapatti jataa rahi he
 On this offer, the company says that this will affect the telecom industry and it is like the old wine in the new bottle
 airtel ne ummid jataai he ki tri is par karrwai karegaa jo ki uske nirdesh kaa khulaa ulanghan he
 Significantly, the telecom regulator TRAI had last week directed the company to withdraw the offer of unlimited calls and data usage on its minimum recharge of Rs 303
 dhan dhana dhan ke liye prime member bananaa he jaruriagar aap prime member nahin banenge to yah ofer aapke liye nahin he
 Because if you have a plan of Rs 309, then you have to pay 99 rupees
 409 rupee ke richarge ke baad aapak dhan dhana dhan ofer ke liye yogya ho jaaenge
 This offer will run for three months and it will get unlimited calling and roaming
 is ofer main mukhya taur par do pack hai
 One is Rs 309 while the other is Rs 509
 donon packs kii validity 84 dinon kii he
 In the plan of 309 rupees, 1GB data will be available every day with unlimited calling
 509 rupee vaale plan main bhi colling analimited he, lekin iske saath yugers ko har din 2GB data diya jayega
 Both these packs will be able to activate users who are not part of the summer surprise offer
 jin yugers ne 99 rupee kaa richarge karaayaa he wo in packs ko itane paise dekar actevet kara sakate hai
 Those who have not taken Prime Membership by paying 99 rupees, they will have to pay 99 rupees extra to activate these packs
 yani wo bhi prime member ban jaaenge
 What will happen if you have already charged 303 + 99 rupees? Recharge of 303 and 99 rupees means you are part of the Sarmar Surprise offer
 aise main aapako ye ofer nahin milegaa
 Because you already have 3 months free offer
 agar 149+99 rupee karicharge karaayaa he to kya hoga?aap prime member ban chuke hai, isliye aapako 309 rupee yaa 509 rupee kaa richarge karana he
 Free offer will be available for three months
 iske baad 149 rupee vaala plan active ho jayega, yaa phir use vauchar kii tarah yuj kar paaenge

 What will be your three immediate priorities as the Chairman of the Board
 main khel ke vikaas, behatar javabdehi or paardarshita par mukhya rup se dhyaan duungaa
 There is also a fourth priority, people should know the truth about former IPL Commissioner Lalit Modi
 logon ko maaloom hona chahie ki bisisiai ek eemaandaar sanstha he
 Why is the BCCI not trying to extradite Modi? unke khilaaf ipiel ke tivi saudon main rishwat lene, tiimon kii nilaamee main herafavri karne or bisisiai ke disha-nirdeshon kaa ulanghan karne ke maamalon main pravartan nideshaalay or iskar vibhaag kii jaanch chal rahi he

 But the issue of Kochi is going on and the team has been suspended due to non-payment

 We did what was written in the manual

 Now the management of Kochi Tuskers has threatened legal action

 This matter needs to be resolved
 main jaanata hum ki aage aap kya poochne vaale hai
 It has no personal agenda
 rajasthan royles or kings ilevan punjab ko lekar bhi kuch mudde the lekin unhen dur kar liya gaya he
 What does the ICC have to say about the sport's recent efforts
 maang he ki associat sadasyon ko or zyada adhikaar die jaaen
 i am against such rules which give more rights to some people
 unhen badale jane kii jarurat he
 Ultimately, the ICC is members and they have to play a joint role in conducting the game
 kya aap maanate hai ki adhyaksh kii niyukti main isisi kii aavartan pranali band honi chahie
 i am of the opinion that the most qualified person should conduct ICC
 ham aisi vyavastha bana sakate hai, jahaan peshewar logon ko jimmedaari saunpi jaae
 Does this mean that the president should be from India
 nahin, meraa matlab yah nahin he
 It can be from any member country
 kya bisisiai rashtriya khel vikaas vidheyak, jisamen bharat main khel sanghathanon par niyantran kii maang kii gai he, ke kaaran cricket ke raajnneetikaran ko khatm karne kii isisi kii maang kaa samarthan karata he
 Politicization of cricket should stop
 lekin jab yah faisla liya gaya tab main kaaryakari board main nahin tha
 i understand that it will not be right to accuse BCCI
 rajeev shukla, vilasarav deshmukh or anuraag thakur jaise netaa bisisiai ke ahm padon par hai
 It seems like you are looking for a political solution to solve the issue which has become a political problem in the game (the Sports Ministry's demand to bring the BCCI under its control)
 bisisiai ke rajya sanghathanon kii suchi ko dekhen, usamen raajnneetikon kii bharmaar he, sivaa dakshin ke, jahaan cricket se jude log hi is khel ko chalaa rahe hai
 Therefore, it is not new to have leaders
 main apane bachaav main yah baat nahin kar rahaa hum
 In 2010, Parliament's Standing Committee on Finance asked the government to investigate the FEMA and FIPB violations of IPL franchisees
 kya bisisiai isamen sahyog karegaa
 Are we not cooperating? modi ke kaarykaal ke ipiel se jude sabhi kagajaat 2010 main jaanch agenciyon ko saunp die gaye the

 This is cricket, not a children's game
 yah agnipariksha he
 The new players will have to perform well if they want to replace the veterans of Sachin and Rahul
 kya cricket main zyada paisa judaa hone se duusare khelon se dhyaan hat rahaa he
 This is a false charge
 bharat main companiyaan isliye paisa lagaati hai ki cricket unhen aakarshak nivesh lagata he
 You cannot blame cricket for the falling condition of other sports
 sach to yah he ki bisisiai bharat main footbal jaise khel kii madad karata he
 last question
 aap pakistan ke khilaaf siries kab khelenge
 The answer is political

 Actually, bjp's strongman Jaswant Singh's son and BJP MLA Manvendra Singh and his wife Chitra Singh have been angry with the party for some time
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki is raily main vah apni agali ranneeti kaa elaan bhi kar sakate hai
 To commemorate this, the district president of Barmer BJP, Jallam Singh Rawat, has been removed from the post of district president on Friday evening
 vahiin unke kareebi maane jane vaale dilip paliwal ko jila adhyaksh banaaya he
 Jalaam Singh Rawat is considered to be an opponent of Manvendra Singh and it is said that Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje made Jalaam Singh Rawat the district president of Barmer due to Manvendra's opposition
 bataa den ki jalam singh ravat pehle maanavendra kii seat shiv se bijepi ke vidhayak rah chuke hai
 It is being said that the central leadership does not want the family of Jaswant Singh, the founder of the BJP, to separate from the BJP in any case
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyakshmit shambhirajasthanmen hai or is masale par vah lagaataar bijepi ke pradesh ikai se sampark main hai
 Earlier in the meetings held in preparation for the Swabhiman rally, Manvendra's wife Chitra Singh said that the time has come for the revenge of 2014 and now there will be war, you should be ready

 Targeting the central government, on Thursday, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party has approached the Supreme Court
 party ne dilli kii vidhansabha ko bhang nahin karne ke uparajyapal kii sifarish ko asanvaidhanik bataate hue arji daakhil kii
 The petition said that the Aam Aadmi Party government had resigned and demanded immediate elections in Delhi, but the central government suspended the legislative assembly and imposed President's rule instead of dissolving the assembly
 AAP kii ore se yachika daayar karne vaale prashanth bhushan ne kaha, centre sarkaar up-rajyapal ke saath mil kar shashan kar rahi he
 This is a conspiracy

 party kaa kahana he ki aise main alji ko bahumat vaali sarkaar kii salaah manani chahie thi
 Najib Jung, contrary to his advice, recommended the Home Ministry to suspend the Assembly and impose President's Rule, which is utterly wrong and unconstitutional

 Since then, there has been a verbal war between the Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP

 When the controversy escalated, not only Tiwari's cleanliness came to light, but with cleanliness, five questions were also brought together

 They should be punished severely
 lekin kuch bade sawaal hai, jinka jawaab kejariwal ko bhi dena chahie
 Tiwari asked Kejriwal these questions - 1 - What policy has the Delhi government made to curb the arbitrary bill system and loot of such hospitals
 kya dilli sarkaar is par gambhir nahin he?2-hospital kaa license radd karne ke parinaam swaroop saikadon garib karmchaaree berojgaar ho gaye
 What is the option for them? 3-what is the option of treating hundreds of serious patients, how many patients belong to EWS in this hospital? 4-why are the government hospitals not doing well? 5-are the government hospitals banned for such negligence Will it be done? 6-why did the Delhi government not implement the policy of the central government which curbs the privet hospitals?

 84 aaj aadmi party dilli main house tex mukti diwas manaayegi
 Under this, the party will burn house tax bills in all the 272 wards in a symbolic manner that if it wins in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections, the house tax bills will have no meaning
 yah bilkul vaisaa hi he jaisaa aam aadmi kii shuruyaat karte hue arvind kejariwal ne mahangi bijli kaa virodh karte hue bijli ke bill jalaakar apni party ke bijli andolan kii shuruyaat kii thi
 The comments aam aadmi party ke dilli pradesh sanyojak dilip pandeya ne bataaya ki 'party kii sabhi ward unit or walantirs shanivaar ko house tex mukti diwas main hissaa lenge or jashn manaayenge ki jab aap satta main aegi to house tex khatm kar degi
 People are confident that just like Arvind Kejriwal waived electricity bills and water bills as soon as coming to power, in the same way house tax will also be waived
 ' In fact, the Aam Aadmi Party's biggest issue and promise in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections is the abolition of house tax and the waiving of arrears
 haalanki vipaksh ke mutabik aisa keval sansad hi kar sakati he
 The common man has kept the theme of his election campaign "first the electricity bill will be half, water will be forgiven, now Delhi will be clean, House tax will be waived
" " is tarah ke hording bhi usne apane prachaar ke tahat dilli main lagavaaye hai
 Aam Aadmi Party's Delhi state convenor Dilip Pandey said that 'all the ward units and volunteers of the party will participate in House Tax Redemption Day on Saturday and celebrate that when you come to power, you will abolish house tax
 logon ko bharosa he ki jaise arvind kejariwal ne satta main aate hi bijli ke bill or pani ke bill maaf kiye thik usee tarah house tex bhi maaf hoga
 ' asal main dilli nagar nigam chunaav main aam aadmi party kaa sabase bada mudda or vaada hi house tex kaa ant or bakaayaa maaf kaa he
 However, according to the opposition, only Parliament can do this
 aam aadmi ne apane chunaav prachaar kii theme hi rakhi he "pehle kiya bijli bill half, pani maaf, ab karenge dilli saaf, house tex maaf
 "he has also installed such hoardings in Delhi as part of his publicity

 salmaan khan unase puche, 'big bos main yadi aapke jaise aalsee pratibhaagi rahenge to kya aap yah sho dekhenge?' The desire to have a son after four daughters proved fatal to tehreek-e-taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud
 ‘da sande times’ ne apni khabar main kaha he ki mehsood buudhvaar ko apane sasur ke ghar apni duusari patni ke saath raat bitaane aayaa tha
 At the same time, an attack by an American drone proved fatal for him
 patni se milane aayaa thakhbar main kaha gaya he ki mehsood kii pehali patni se uski chaar betiyaan thim, lekin wajiristaan ke kabeelai ilaakon main ladke ke janm ko hi asli jashn mana jaataa he
 The newspaper has stated that Mehsud brought a second wife in November last year, who was the daughter of a local ulema
 missile ke hamale ke dauraan mehsood jangraha gaanv main apni patni ke saath raat bitaane aayaa tha
 According to the news, Mehsud took this threat due to the desire of a son
 madhumeh kaa rogi tha mahasudamadhumeh kaa marij mahsood wajiristaan kii garmi main pareshaani mahasoos kar rahaa tha or ek sthaneey chikitsak ne use glucose chadhvane kii bhi salaah di thi
 It is also said in the news that as Mehsud lay on the bed lying on the roof of the house, the camera of the drone captured him
 iske saath hi drone ko hajaaron kimi dur ke nevada registan se ek aadesh mila or uske baad do mixilon ne imaarat kii mitti kii diwaar par hamalaa kar diya
 The entire fuselage was damaged and the newspaper quoted a Pakistani intelligence official living in the nearby city of Makin as saying that the entire torso was left deformed except Mehsud's head
 shuruaati khabaron main kaha gaya tha ki mehsood kii patni or uske do surakshakarmiyon kii maut ho gai he, lekin iske baad agle din najdiki narghasi main kriyakarm kii rasm ke dauraan badi sankhya main logon kii maujuudagi se andeh paidaa hua
 Pakistan's Home Minister Rehman Malik said on Saturday that we have received information that Mehsud, his wife and seven security personnel have been killed, but we are waiting for evidence to confirm
 corporator se nagpur ke sabase yuva meyar bane devendra fadanvis maharashtra main bijepi ke pehle mukhyamantri honge, jinhone raajnneetik seedhiyaan kramik rup se chadhi hai
 The 44-year-old Fadnavis has deep roots in the RSS in this state dominated by Maratha politics and Maratha leaders
 bijepi se alag ho chuke sahyogi dal shivasena ke manohar joshi ke baad vah aise duusare brahman netaa hai jo mukhyamantri banenge
 After emerging as the bjp's largest party in the assembly elections, the soft-spoken and young leader Phadnavis is clearly the favorite leader for this top post, for which many leaders of the party's state committee have lobbied heavily
 vah pradhanmantri narendra modi or party adhyaksh amit shah ke bhi bharosemand hai
 In the election rally, Modi said for him, 'devendra is Nagpur's gift to the country
 ' haalanki, modi ne loksabhaa chunaav or maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan america tarj par chunaav prachaar kiya tha par in chunaavon main mili jabardast jeet kaa shrey pradesh bhaajapa adhyaksh fadanvis ko bhi jaataa he
 The saffron alliance, along with the Shiv Sena and the Swabhimani Shetkari Paksha, won 42 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats
 vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle shivasena se naata tuutane ke baavjood bhaajapa ne 288 sadasyeey sadan main 122 siten hasil kin jabaki 2009 main use 46 siten hi mili thim
 Both Modi and Shah have praised him for the way Fadnavis managed the election
 jan sangh se jude rahe or baad main bijepi ke netaa bane divangat gangadhar fadanvis ke bete devendra yuvavastha main hi raajnneeti main utar gaye the, jab vah 1989 main aresas kii chaatr shakha akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad main shaamil hue the
 Gangadhar is called his fellow political leader and former party chief Nitin Gadkari his 'political guru'
 mahaj 22 saal kii umr main vah nagpur sthaneey nikaay se corporator ban gaye or 27 saal kii aayu main 1997 main nagpur ke sabase yuva meyar chune gaye
 Fadnavis contested the assembly elections for the first time in 1999 and won it

 maharashtra ke raajnneetik paridrishy main kai netaaon ke ulat fadanvis bedaag rahe hai
 The credit of besieging the previous congress-ncp government over the alleged irrigation scam also goes to Fadnavis
 vidarbha kshetra main kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke liye is ghotaale ko kai log praathmik rup se jimmedaar tehraate hai
 The issue of Vidarbha touched his heart so much that during a discussion on the demand for a separate state, he once angrily told a Shiv Sena MLA, 'get out of Vidarbha
 ' haalanki, shivasena alag vidarbha rajya ke gathan ke liye maharashtra ke vibhaajan kaa lagaataar virodh karti rahi he
 Fadnavis slowed down his pro-vidarbha voice during the assembly elections, when the Shiv Sena accused the BJP of splitting the state if it came to power
 bijepi netaa ne kaha ki party prashasnic suvidha ke liye chote rajyon ke paksh main he lekin nae rajyon kaa gathan centre ke daayre main he
 Fadnavis holds a law degree and a post graduate degree in business management
 unhone arthshaastra main do pustaken bhi likhi hai
 Opposition leader Eknath Khadse and former BJP state president Sudhir Mungantiwar were also being discussed in the outgoing assembly for the chief minister's post
 par fadanvis kabhi mantri pad par nahin rahe hai
 At the same time, critics of Fadnavis have highlighted the lack of administrative experience in them
 haalanki, ek saaf suthri chhavi hone or modi-shah ke majboot samarthan ke chalate nagpur ke is yuva netaa ne vijeta ke rup main ubharne ke liye sari baadhaon ko paar kar liya
 Another day of the budget session in Rajya Sabha has been a ruckus
 buudhvaar ko sadan kikaaryawahi shuru hote hivipaksh ne koyala or khanij bill kaa virodh kiya, jabaki is bich select cameti kii report pesh kii gai
 As soon as the report came, Ghulam Nabi Azad protested against it from the Congress, in which the entire opposition got a note
 hangaamaa hone ke baad sadan kii kaarywahi ko 10 minute ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya
 As soon as the proceedings started, at about 11 am, Chairman of the Select Committee, Bhupendra Yadav presented a report on the Minerals and Coal Bill
 report pesh hote hi gulam nabi aaazaad ne virodh jataate hue kaha ki unki baton par dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa he
 The rest of the opposition parties started raising noise after Azad's protest
 hangaamaa karte hue saansad sadan kii wel tak pahunch gaye, jiske baad sadan kii kaarywahi ko 10 minute ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya

 kya smriti irani ne rohit vemula ke maamle main jhooth bolaa or mahisasur kii puja or durga ke sambandh main kii gai tippanee ko pesh kar galati kii
 When she reached the Rajya Sabha with her stormy speech from the Lok Sabha, the opposition mps already prepared there reduced their chances of getting emotional with questions and objections
 pradhanmantri modi ne unke bhaashan ko satyamev bataa kar twit kar diya to kolkata ke telegraph akhbaar kaa pehla panna poochne laga ki kiskaa satyam satya he pradhanmantri? smriti irani ne loksabhaa main kaha ki khudakushi ke agle din subah saadhe chah baje tak kisi doctor ko rohit ke shav tak nahin pahunchane diya gaya
 He could be saved
 lekin hyderabad uniwarsity kii chif medical afasar ne unki baton ko chunauti de di or kaha ki ve maukey par gai thim or rohit ko mrit paaya tha
 In prime time on Thursday, BJP spokesperson Dr Sambit Patra challenged that he is a doctor himself, so he can say that death certificate is not given at the scene, hand written and without stamp, the death certificate is given to the hospital
 And that too after performing ECG
 doctor rajshri ne guuruuvaar ko kaha tha ki rigar martis ke kaaran bachaane kii gunzaaish khatm ho chuki thi
 i had heard these words for the first time, so let go of Dr
 Patra's talk, but later the doctors called me and pulled me up on his misrepresentation and said that you let the facts against medical science go public
 doctor vali ne kaha ki jab sharir main akadan aa jaati he tab use bachaaya nahin ja saktaa he
 It also said that the death certificate can be given on the spot and also by hand writing
 doctor ke
 K
 agarwal ne parimal se kaha ki agar dimag, putali, cornea main koi harakat nahin hoti to maukey par mrityu pramaan patr jari kar sakate hai
 There will be no pulse, there will not be BP and if the body is stuck, it is called being rigger mortis
 matlab kaaphi der pehle mrityu ho chuki he
 In this case, there is no need to do a test
 rigar martis ke cese main isiji nahin kii jaati he balki aise cese main police bhi bina doctor ke mrityu pramaan patr jari kar sakati he
 Uma Sudhir told us from Hyderabad that the report that the Telangana police submitted to the court there on January 31 did not say that the doctor had examined it
 police aisa kaise likh sakati he jabaki khud doctor bol rahi hai
 Didn't the medical examination take place in the room or after the body was taken
 kya smriti irani ko ye baat maaloom thi? agar thi to kya unhen police par sawaal nahin uthaane chahie the
 The question also arises as to what police report they were reading in which there is no mention of doctor's investigation
 ham satyapit to nahin kar sakate lekin rohit ke doston ke diye video main saaf dikh rahaa he ki kamare main police or doctor donon the
 The doctor also said that when she got close to Rohit, the police were there
 jabaki mantri ji ne kaha ki police ko subah tak shav ke paas jane hi nahin diya gaya
 Did he add on his behalf that there was no medical examination of Rohit
 ab jab ye vivaad hua he to telugana police kyon nahin apni taraf se tathyon ko saamne rakhti he
 There is an uproar in the country's Parliament and the police there is silent, is it not a kind of non-accountability
 yah bhi dilachasp he ki telugana police ne jo report saunpi he usamen ye likhaa he ki rohit vaddera samudaay kaa tha jo ki pichhadi jati he
 The Tehsildar of Guntur district has verified this
 smriti irani ne apane bhaashan main iskaa zikr nahin kiya he
 One aspect is that according to the Supreme Court order Rohit chose his mother's caste who are Dalits
 rohit kaa ek anusuchit jati kaa praaanpatr bhi he
 On Friday, there were very sharp speeches in Rajya Sabha regarding Smriti Irani's speech
 kendriya mantri smriti irani ne do tathyaatmak jawaab diye jise phir se chunauti di jane lagi he
 He said that the child was given scholarship of Rs 3,19,010
 use antim fellowship 20 november 2015 ko di gai jisaki raashi 54000 he, kuch raashi zarur nahin mili wo rohit ke kaagazi karrwai puri nahin karne ke kaaran nahin mili
 Therefore, the allegations of stopping scholarship are false
 mayawati ne poocha ki 10 agast 2015 ko proctorial board ne jo faisla liya kya usamen koi dalit tha yaa mahila thi, smriti irani ne iskaa jawaab nahin diya lekin mayawati ke is sawaal kaa jawaab diya ki sazaa sunaane vaali kaaryakari parishad main dalit tha, to unhone kaha ki samiti main vishesh rup se dalit samudaay ko ko-opt kiya gaya
 To Dean of Student Welfare
 isliye yah aarope galat he
 Dean of Student Welfare Prakash Babu has stated on record that he was not the head of the executive committee sub-committee
 unhone to sazaa kaa virodh kiya tha
 Smriti Irani had said in her first press conference that the head of the sub-committee was a Dalit
 loksabhaa main police kii report padhane main koi dikkat to nahin hui lekin rajyasabha main smriti irani ne kaha ki child ab is duniya main nahin he isliye exiaar kii copy padhanaa uchit nahin rahegaa jisamen rohit par bhi aarope lagaae gaye hai
 Then why did he read Rohit Vemula's Facebook post to challenge CPM in Rajya Sabha in which Rohit has criticized CPM
 seetaram yechuri ne up sabhapati se vyavastha dene ko kaha ki kya twitor, fasebuk ke post bhi sadan main padhe jaaenge
 Smriti Irani told about the inquiry committee of her ministry that it had minority and backward caste officers
 jabaki mayawati puch rahi thim ki nyaayik jaanch cameti main koi dalit he
 The Union Minister said that the judge, who is not satisfied, has given him the responsibility of judicial inquiry as Chief Minister himself
 ab aate hai mahisasur vaale prasang par
 Many members of the Opposition objected that the minister has not corrected the objectionable statement about Durga
 is tarah se koi pamfalet uthaakar sadan main aisi baat nahin honi chahie thi
 The Deputy Chairman said that they would investigate this but the matter went beyond that in the Indian tradition there are many stories around a goddess who sometimes goes against each other
 seetaram yechuri ne kaha, 'hindu hone kaa pramaan bijepi ke netaa nahin denge
 Sitaram said that in Kerala tradition we celebrate Onam because Mahabali was revived that day
 mahabali koun tha
 In Hindu tradition there was a king of Asuras who was killed by Vishnu
 aisi paramparaon se raajnneetik chhedchhad kya sahi hogi
 Mahishasura is worshiped in many places
 hamaari parampara main bahut se devi devataaon ke bare main aisa kuch kaha gaya he jiskaa raajnneetik istamaal karnaa behad khataranaak ho saktaa he
 Whereas the society lives with those traditions and excesses so easily
 tippaniyan How did the incident of Mahishasura get into this debate
 smriti irani abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke aaropon ke sandarbh main iskaa zikr kar gayi lekin kya paramparaon kii vividhta kya kisi sarkaar ke aashirwad se sadiyon se kaayam he
 Shall we use those traditions to commemorate or even mention, as an example of freedom of expression
 khayr mahisasur or durga prasang se tivi or sadan ke baahar dalit adivasee samaaj main pratikriya ho rahi he use dekhakar ek sawaal to uthta he ki bijepi ne itnaa gambhir jokhim kyon liya
 There is a lot of anger in the Dalit society
 shuukravaar ko jis tarah se mayawati gusse main bol rahi thim, unke lafz kaanp rahe the
 One case is about the replies given by the Union Minister to Rohit Vemula, one is about the political tampering of our traditions
 mahisasur kaa maamla aisa he jise aap raajnneeti main laakar lalakaarenge to isse raajnneetik virodhiyon ko thikaane to lagaaya ja saktaa he magar isse samaaj ke hi do hisse aamane saamne ho jaaenge or paramparao ko lekar raajnneetik sangharsh tej ho saktaa he
 Shibu Sorene once called for Mahishasura Day to be celebrated on a large scale
 bundelkhand main mahisasur kaa mandir he
 a 1500 years old monument of Mahishasura is preserved by the Archaeological Survey of India
 ye teenon tathy forverd press ke email se mili hai
 At the social level, marginalized society has always coined its religious and mythological symbols
 kai baar ye pratik mukhyadhara kii panraparaaon ke kilaaf hote hai
 What will happen if Dalit tribals get down on the struggle over their traditions
 aakhir bijepi kuch to soch kar raajnneetik bachaav kar rahi he
 He too will have a view
 guuruuvaar ko prime time main bijepi pravaktaa doctor sambit paatra ne chunauti dete hue kaha ki ve khud ek doctor hai isliye kah sakate hai ki ghatnasthal par mrityu pramaan patr nahin diya jaataa, haath se likhakar or bina stamp ke nahin diya jaataa, mrityu pramaan patr aspataal main diya jaataa he or wo bhi isiji karne ke baad
 On Thursday, Dr
 Rajshree said that the scope of saving due to rigger mortis was over
 maine pehali baar ye shabd suna tha lihaaza doctor paatra kii baat ko jane diya lekin baad main doctoron ne phone kar unki galat bayani par meri khinchaai kii or kaha ki aapane public ke bich medical science ke khilaaf tathy jane diye
 Doctor Vali said that when the body becomes stiff then it cannot be saved
 yah bhi kaha ki mrityu pramaan patr maukey par or haath se likhakar bhi diya ja saktaa he
 Doctor's ke
 Aggarwal told Parimal that if there is no movement in the brain, pupil, cornea, then he can issue death certificate on the spot
 pulse nahin hoga, beepi nahin hogi or sharir agar akad gaya he to use rigar martis hona kehete hai
 Means has died long ago
 aise main test karne kii zarurat nahin he
 ECG is not done in the case of Rigger Mortis but in such case the police can also issue death certificate without a doctor
 uma sudhir ne hyderabad se hamen bataaya ki telugana police ne 31 janvari ko vahaan kii adaalat main jo report saunpi he usamen yahi nahin likhaa he ki doctor ne jaanch kii he
 How can the police write this while the doctors themselves are speaking
 kamare main yaa shav le jane ke baad kya medical jaanch hi nahin hui
 Did Smriti Irani know this? If they were, should they not have questioned the police? sawaal yah bhi uthta he ki ve police kii koun si report pard rahi thim jisamen doctor kii jaanch kii baat hi nahin likhi he
 We cannot verify but in the video given by Rohit's friends it is clearly visible that there were both police and doctors in the room
 damctor ne bhi kaha ki ve jab rohit ke kareeb pahunchi to police vahaan thim
 Whereas the Minister said that the police were not allowed to go near the dead body till morning
 kya unhone apni taraf se ye baat jod di ki rohit kii koi medical jaanch nahin hui
 Now when this dispute has taken place, why does the Telangana Police not reveal the facts on its behalf
 desh kii sansad main hangaamaa ho rahaa he or vahaan kii police chup he kya ye ek kism kii gair javabdehi nahin he
 It is also interesting that in the report submitted by the Telangana Police it is written that Rohit belonged to the Vaddera community which is a backward caste
 guntur zile ke tehseeldaar ne ise satyapit kiya he
 Smriti Irani has not mentioned this in her speech
 ek paksh yah he ki supreme court ke aadesh ke anusaar rohit ne apni maa kii jati chuni jo dalit hai
 Rohit also has a Scheduled Caste certificate
 shuukravaar ko bhi smriti irani ke bhaashan ko lekar rajyasabha main kaaphi tikhe bhaashan hue
 Union Minister Smriti Irani gave two factual answers which are again being challenged
 unhone bataaya ki bachche ko 3,19,010 rupee kii scolership de di gai thi
 The last fellowship was given to him on 20 November 2015, which amounted to 54000, some amount was not received due to Rohit not completing the paperwork
 isliye scolership rokane ke aarope galat hai
 Mayawati asked that on 10 August 2015, whether the proctorial board decided whether it was a Dalit or a woman, Smriti Irani did not answer it but replied to Mayawati's question that there was a Dalit in the executive council that sentenced him, then he Said that the Dalit community in particular was co-opted in the committee
 dean of student welfare ko
 Therefore, this charge is false
 dean of student welfare prakaash babu ne on ricard kaha he ki ve kaaryakari parishad kii up samiti ke pramukh nahin the
 He was opposed to the punishment
 smriti irani ne to apane pehle press conferes main kaha tha ki up samiti ke mukhiya dalit the
 There was no problem in reading the police report in the Lok Sabha, but Smriti Irani said in the Rajya Sabha that the child is no longer in this world, so it will not be appropriate to read a copy of the FIR in which Rohit has also been charged
 phir unhone rajyasabha main sipiem ko chunauti dene ke liye rohit vemula kaa fasebuk post kyon padhaa jisamen rohit ne sipiem kii aalochana kii he
 Sitaram Yechury asked the Deputy Chairman to give the arrangement whether the tweeter, Facebook posts will also be read in the House
 smriti irani ne apane mantralay kii jaanch cameti ke bare main bataaya ki usamen alpsankhyak or pichhadi jati ke afasar the
 While Mayawati was asking that there is any Dalit in the Judicial Inquiry Committee
 kendriya mantri ne kaha ki jis jaj se bahan ji ko santosh nahin ho rahaa he unhen khud mukhyamantri rahete hue nyaayik jaanch kii zimmedaari de chuki hai
 Now come to the Mahishasura theme
 vipaksh ke kai sadasyon ne etraz kiya ki durga ke bare main aapattijanak bayaan padhakar mantri ne sahi nahin kiya he
 By raising a pamphlet in this way, such a thing should not have happened in the House
 up sabhapati ne kaha ki ve isaki jaanch karenge lekin baat isse aage nikal gai ki hindustan kii parampara main ek devi ke ird gird anek kisse hai jo kai baar ek duusare ke kilaaf bhi jate hai
 Sitaram Yechury said, 'BJP leaders will not provide proof of being Hindu
 ' seetaram ne kaha ki kerala kii parampara main ham olym manaate hai kyonki us din mahabali punerjeevit hua tha
 Who was Mahabali? hindu panrapara main asuron kaa raja tha jise vishnu ne maar diya tha
 What political corrections would be right from such traditions
 mahisasur kii puja kai jagahon par hoti he
 In our tradition, something has been said about many gods and goddesses, which can be very dangerous to use politically
 jabaki samaaj un paramparaon or ativichaaron ke saath kitni sahajata se jeeta rahata he
 The comments mahisasur kaa prasang kaise is bahes main aa gaya
 Smriti Irani referred to it in the context of allegations of freedom of expression, but does the diversity of traditions last for centuries with the blessings of a government
 kya ham un paramparaon ko manaane yaa zikr karne ko bhi abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke misaal ke liye istemaal karenge
 Well, seeing the reaction of Mahishasur and Durga incident in the TV and Dalit tribal society outside the House, a question arises why BJP took such a serious risk
 dalit samaaj main kaaphi gussa he
 The way Mayawati was speaking angrily on Friday, her words were trembling
 ek maamla rohit vemula ko lekar kendriya mantri ke diye gaye javaabon ko lekar he, ek maamla hamaari panraparaaon ke saath raajnneetik chhedchhad ko lekar he
 The case of Mahishasura is such that if you dare to bring it into politics, then it can be imposed on political opponents, but it will bring two parts of society face to face and the political struggle on traditions can intensify
 shibu sorene ne ek baar aahvaan kiya tha ki mahisasur diwas bade paimaane par manaaya jaae
 There is a temple of Mahishasura in Bundelkhand
 mahisasur ke ek 1500 saal puraane smarak ko orcyological survey aaf india sangrakshit karata he
 All these three facts were found in an email from Forward Press
 saamaajik str par haashiye ke samaaj ne hameshaa se apni dharmik or mythkiy pratikon ko gadha he
 Many times these symbols are against mainstream traditions
 dalit adivasee agar apni paramparon ko lekar sangharsh par utar aae to kya hoga
 After all, the BJP is thinking something political to defend
 uskaa bhi to koi nazariyaa hoga
 Doctor Vali said that when the body becomes stiff then it cannot be saved
 yah bhi kaha ki mrityu pramaan patr maukey par or haath se likhakar bhi diya ja saktaa he
 Doctor's ke

 Mayawati asked that on 10 August 2015, whether the proctorial board decided whether it was a Dalit or a woman, Smriti Irani did not answer it but replied to Mayawati's question that there was a Dalit in the executive council that sentenced him, then he Said that the Dalit community in particular was co-opted in the committee
 dean of student welfare ko
 Therefore, this charge is false
 dean of student welfare prakaash babu ne on ricard kaha he ki ve kaaryakari parishad kii up samiti ke pramukh nahin the
 He was opposed to the punishment
 smriti irani ne to apane pehle press conferes main kaha tha ki up samiti ke mukhiya dalit the
 There was no problem in reading the police report in the Lok Sabha, but Smriti Irani said in the Rajya Sabha that the child is no longer in this world, so it will not be appropriate to read a copy of the FIR in which Rohit has also been charged
 phir unhone rajyasabha main sipiem ko chunauti dene ke liye rohit vemula kaa fasebuk post kyon padhaa jisamen rohit ne sipiem kii aalochana kii he
 Sitaram Yechury asked the Deputy Chairman to give the arrangement whether the tweeter, Facebook posts will also be read in the House

 While Mayawati was asking that there is any Dalit in the Judicial Inquiry Committee
 kendriya mantri ne kaha ki jis jaj se bahan ji ko santosh nahin ho rahaa he unhen khud mukhyamantri rahete hue nyaayik jaanch kii zimmedaari de chuki hai
 Now come to the Mahishasura theme
 vipaksh ke kai sadasyon ne etraz kiya ki durga ke bare main aapattijanak bayaan padhakar mantri ne sahi nahin kiya he
 By raising a pamphlet in this way, such a thing should not have happened in the House
 up sabhapati ne kaha ki ve isaki jaanch karenge lekin baat isse aage nikal gai ki hindustan kii parampara main ek devi ke ird gird anek kisse hai jo kai baar ek duusare ke kilaaf bhi jate hai

 ' seetaram ne kaha ki kerala kii parampara main ham olym manaate hai kyonki us din mahabali punerjeevit hua tha
 Who was Mahabali? hindu panrapara main asuron kaa raja tha jise vishnu ne maar diya tha
 What political corrections would be right from such traditions
 mahisasur kii puja kai jagahon par hoti he
 In our tradition, something has been said about many gods and goddesses, which can be very dangerous to use politically
 jabaki samaaj un paramparaon or ativichaaron ke saath kitni sahajata se jeeta rahata he
 The comments mahisasur kaa prasang kaise is bahes main aa gaya
 Smriti Irani referred to it in the context of allegations of freedom of expression, but does the diversity of traditions last for centuries with the blessings of a government
 kya ham un paramparaon ko manaane yaa zikr karne ko bhi abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke misaal ke liye istemaal karenge
 Well, seeing the reaction of Mahishasur and Durga incident in the TV and Dalit tribal society outside the House, a question arises why BJP took such a serious risk
 dalit samaaj main kaaphi gussa he
 The way Mayawati was speaking angrily on Friday, her words were trembling
 ek maamla rohit vemula ko lekar kendriya mantri ke diye gaye javaabon ko lekar he, ek maamla hamaari panraparaaon ke saath raajnneetik chhedchhad ko lekar he
 The case of Mahishasura is such that if you dare to bring it into politics, then it can be imposed on political opponents, but it will bring two parts of society face to face and the political struggle on traditions can intensify

 dalit adivasee agar apni paramparon ko lekar sangharsh par utar aae to kya hoga
 After all, the BJP is thinking something political to defend
 uskaa bhi to koi nazariyaa hoga
 Uma Sudhir told us from Hyderabad that the report that the Telangana police submitted to the court there on January 31 did not say that the doctor had examined it
 police aisa kaise likh sakati he jabaki khud doctor bol rahi hai
 Didn't the medical examination take place in the room or after the body was taken
 kya smriti irani ko ye baat maaloom thi? agar thi to kya unhen police par sawaal nahin uthaane chahie the
 The question also arises as to what police report they were reading in which there is no mention of doctor's investigation
 ham satyapit to nahin kar sakate lekin rohit ke doston ke diye video main saaf dikh rahaa he ki kamare main police or doctor donon the
 The doctor also said that when she got close to Rohit, the police were there
 jabaki mantri ji ne kaha ki police ko subah tak shav ke paas jane hi nahin diya gaya

 dalit adivasee agar apni paramparon ko lekar sangharsh par utar aae to kya hoga
 After all, the BJP is thinking something political to defend
 uskaa bhi to koi nazariyaa hoga
 Now come to the Mahishasura theme
 vipaksh ke kai sadasyon ne etraz kiya ki durga ke bare main aapattijanak bayaan padhakar mantri ne sahi nahin kiya he
 By raising a pamphlet in this way, such a thing should not have happened in the House
 up sabhapati ne kaha ki ve isaki jaanch karenge lekin baat isse aage nikal gai ki hindustan kii parampara main ek devi ke ird gird anek kisse hai jo kai baar ek duusare ke kilaaf bhi jate hai
 Sitaram Yechury said, 'BJP leaders will not provide proof of being Hindu
 ' seetaram ne kaha ki kerala kii parampara main ham olym manaate hai kyonki us din mahabali punerjeevit hua tha
 Who was Mahabali? hindu panrapara main asuron kaa raja tha jise vishnu ne maar diya tha
 What political corrections would be right from such traditions
 mahisasur kii puja kai jagahon par hoti he
 In our tradition, something has been said about many gods and goddesses, which can be very dangerous to use politically
 jabaki samaaj un paramparaon or ativichaaron ke saath kitni sahajata se jeeta rahata he
 The comments mahisasur kaa prasang kaise is bahes main aa gaya
 Smriti Irani referred to it in the context of allegations of freedom of expression, but does the diversity of traditions last for centuries with the blessings of a government
 kya ham un paramparaon ko manaane yaa zikr karne ko bhi abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke misaal ke liye istemaal karenge
 Well, seeing the reaction of Mahishasur and Durga incident in the TV and Dalit tribal society outside the House, a question arises why BJP took such a serious risk
 dalit samaaj main kaaphi gussa he
 The way Mayawati was speaking angrily on Friday, her words were trembling
 ek maamla rohit vemula ko lekar kendriya mantri ke diye gaye javaabon ko lekar he, ek maamla hamaari panraparaaon ke saath raajnneetik chhedchhad ko lekar he
 The case of Mahishasura is such that if you dare to bring it into politics, then it can be imposed on political opponents, but it will bring two parts of society face to face and the political struggle on traditions can intensify
 shibu sorene ne ek baar aahvaan kiya tha ki mahisasur diwas bade paimaane par manaaya jaae

 After all, the BJP is thinking something political to defend
 uskaa bhi to koi nazariyaa hoga
 How did the incident of Mahishasura get into this debate
 smriti irani abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke aaropon ke sandarbh main iskaa zikr kar gayi lekin kya paramparaon kii vividhta kya kisi sarkaar ke aashirwad se sadiyon se kaayam he
 Shall we use those traditions to commemorate or even mention, as an example of freedom of expression
 khayr mahisasur or durga prasang se tivi or sadan ke baahar dalit adivasee samaaj main pratikriya ho rahi he use dekhakar ek sawaal to uthta he ki bijepi ne itnaa gambhir jokhim kyon liya
 There is a lot of anger in the Dalit society
 shuukravaar ko jis tarah se mayawati gusse main bol rahi thim, unke lafz kaanp rahe the
 One case is about the replies given by the Union Minister to Rohit Vemula, one is about the political tampering of our traditions
 mahisasur kaa maamla aisa he jise aap raajnneeti main laakar lalakaarenge to isse raajnneetik virodhiyon ko thikaane to lagaaya ja saktaa he magar isse samaaj ke hi do hisse aamane saamne ho jaaenge or paramparao ko lekar raajnneetik sangharsh tej ho saktaa he

 At the social level, marginalized society has always coined its religious and mythological symbols
 kai baar ye pratik mukhyadhara kii panraparaaon ke kilaaf hote hai
 What will happen if Dalit tribals get down on the struggle over their traditions
 aakhir bijepi kuch to soch kar raajnneetik bachaav kar rahi he
 He too will have a view
 ek maamla rohit vemula ko lekar kendriya mantri ke diye gaye javaabon ko lekar he, ek maamla hamaari panraparaaon ke saath raajnneetik chhedchhad ko lekar he

 He said that Ram Vilas Paswan had 'holika Dahan' of his ideology before Holi festival
 jediu netaa sabir ali ne kaha ki congress maukaparast party he


ab use samaj main aa gaya he ki bihar main argedy kii jameen khisak gai he, isliye congress lalu se duuri bana rahi he

 vahiin jediu se nikaale gaye netaa shivanand tiwari kaa kahana he ki gathbandhan main lalu ko ahmiyat deni hogi, tabhi is gathbandhan ke phaayde honge
 On the other hand, RJD leader Manoj Jha is talking about announcing the alliance as soon as possible, while BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi says that the rift between RJD and Congress has made it clear that the parties that call themselves secular The front is completely hollow

 The bail of Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, the main accused in the Mumbai attacks, is a failure of the judicial system there
 sari duniya jaanati he ki is vahashi ne kaise pakistani aatankiyon se mumbai main begunaah nagarikon ko maarane ko kaha tha
 This has also been confirmed by his partners David Headley and Abu Jundal
 uski awaz ke sample america khufia agenciyon ko paas hai jinhone mana ki mubani hamalon ke dauraan jis aadmi kii awaz us ore se aa rahi thi vah lakhvi hi tha
 Jundal even told that on the day Mumbai was attacked, Lakhvi was directing the terrorists on the phone from there
 vah sidhe taur par mumbai hamalon ke liye jimmedaar he jisamen 166 begunaah log maare gaye the
 India provided all the evidence to Pakistan and the trial started on their basis
 shuru main to pakistanki isamen dilchaspee nahin thi lekin antarrashtriya dabaav se vah jhukaa or isaki shuruuaat kii gai
 This trial went on with great difficulty, sometimes judges would change and sometimes people would not come
 jin jajon ne eemaandaaree se is maamle ko dekhnaa shuru kiya unhen jaan se maarane kii dhamkiyaan bhi milin
 One judge left the case
 taarikh par taarikh lagati chali gai, asal mukadmaa to kabhi shuru hi nahin hua
 However, it was reassuring that he was lodged in jail, but now it is too much that a judge has granted him bail
 haalanki vah jail main bhi rahakar shahi jindagi ji rahaa tha or parol par baraabar baahar aata rahaa
 In fact, the gang that led Lakhvi was a special ISI and was used against India for proxy war
 iesai ne samay-samay par bharat ko chot pahunchane ke liye aatankiyon kaa sahaara liya he
 lashkar-e-toiba is the gang that took great interest in it and carried out terrorist operations in India
 mumbai hamalon main giraftaar ajmal kasaab ne bhi is baat kii tasdik kii he ki iesai kaa ek major unhen training detaa tha
 The ISI has played a major role in increasing cross-border terrorism in India and has conducted several attacks on young men who have gone mad in the name of such mercenaries or religion
 thik isi tarah talibaniyon ne begunaah bacchon ko peshawar main maravaaya
 His leader gave instructions on the phone in the same way Lakhvi used to give
 matlab saaf he ki aatankwaad kisi kaa saath nahin detaa
 And now that Pakistan is deeply hurt, it has to understand that killers or terrorists are not good or bad
 ve sirf bure hote hai
 They are enemies of humanity and must end
 yah to acha hua ki pakistan ke hukmran samay rahete hue chet gaye or unhone lakhvi ko duusare aarope main andar kar diya
 He has also assured that he will appeal against the decision of the lower court to the High Court
 lakhvi kaa baahar rahanaa or us par mukadmaa ne chalanaa badi buree sthiti hoti
 This would have encouraged the courage of people like him and he would have committed such inhuman acts
 peshawar kii dukhad ghatana ke baad to pakistan sarkaar ko aatankwaad ke bare main phir se niti banani hogi
 He will have to think how peace and tranquility prevail in this area and all the countries should progress together like the countries of ASEAN

 According to the ICC statement, Bresnan has been found guilty of violating the Level 1 rule of the ICC Code of Conduct, which deals with wrong attitude towards cricket equipment, apparel, field equipment etc
 bresanan ne england kii pari ke 48wein over main piyush chawla kii antim gend par bold hone ke baad apana balla viketon par maaraa tha
 ICC match referee Roshan Mahanama reprimanded Bresnan for this
 unhone kaha, maine faisla karte samay is baat ko dhyaan main rakhaa ki bresanan ne apni galati sweekaar kii he or maafee maang lee he
 Apart from this, he has done this for the first time
 level 1 niyam ke ulanghan ke liye khilaadi par adhik se adhik match fees kaa 50 pratishat kaa jurmaana kiya ja saktaa he
 Bresnan was reported by on-field umpires Billy Boden and Marais Erasmus, third umpire Rad Tucker and fourth umpire Aleem Dar
 is bich england kii team ne is match main nirdhaarit samay main ek over kam kiya tha
 According to the code of conduct, players are fined 10 percent of the match fee and 20 percent on the captain for reducing an over
 is tarah se strans par 20 pratishat or khilaadiyon par match fees kaa 10 pratishat jurmaana kiya gaya he
 MNS leader Raj Thackeray has played a new bet in view of the assembly elections in Maharashtra
 ab wo kah rahe hai ki naa to unhan ensipi-congress gathbandhan se parhez he or naa shivasena-bijepi gathbandhan se
 Raj throws the conditional support letter: Thackeray, who is trying his luck for the first time in the Assembly elections, has thrown a leaf of support with conditions
 raajnneetik halkon main iske matlab nikaale ja rahe hai
 In the Lok Sabha elections, Raj Thackeray's party MNS showed the strength of the Shiv sena-bjp alliance to win a lot of votes and hence its strength for Maharashtra assembly elections is much higher
 lekin raaj thakare ne chunaav se thik pehle kisi bhi gathbandhan ko sashart samarthan dene kaa daanv phenkakar sabko hairaan kar diya he
 The terms have not been disclosed, although Raj has not yet opened his terms of cards, but it is clear that Raj is neither avoiding the congress-ncp alliance nor the Shiv sena-bjp alliance
 ho saktaa he ki raaj ne shart kii baat chhedakar sirf marathi maanush ko rijhaane kaa nayaa daanv khelaa ho lekin maharashtra ke siyaasi halkon main raaj ke bayaan ke doorgaami matlab bhi dhunde jane lage hai

 For many years the media and fans have been asking Salman the same question, when will Bhaijaan get married? When will the Galaxy apartment shine with Salman's wedding twinkle? Salman's marriage is not less than any national topic
 is bich times of india kii ek report ke baad yah charchaa bhi chal padi he ki salmaan khan sarogesi ke jariye pita banane kii taiyaari main hai
 Knowing the news of Salman Khan becoming a father, his fans are excited
 lekin sarogeri ke opshan ne salmaan khan kii shaadi par bhi bada sawaal khadaa kar diya he
 If Salman's preparations are true, should it be assumed that Salman Khan, who wants to become a father through surrogacy, will no longer marry
 baccha paane ke baad salmaan ko umr ke is padaav main shaayad shaadi kii zarurat hi na rah jaaegi
 Anyway, many statements of Salman have also made it clear that the actor runs away from marriage
 bacchon se lagaav, par kyon shaadi se darate hai salmaan?salmaan khan ko bachche behad pyaare hai
 He is deeply attached to the children of his family
 ek intervyuu main dabang khan ne kaha tha ki ''ve achche bete hai or achche pita ban sakate hai
 But might not be able to be a good husband
 '' shaayad in dinon aae din celebs ke ho rahe talaak ne bhi salmaan ko shaadi ko lekar daraa diya he
 Salman considers Bhai Arbaaz Khan to be divorced after 19 years with Malaika
 ek chat sho main salmaan ne kaha tha, "shaadi karne ke baad aisa hota he to main bachaler hi khush hum
 "view this post on Instagram officiala post shared bysalman Khan(@beingsalmankhan) onapr 24, 2019 at 4:01am pdtkorta cese kii vajah se shaadi ke liye ruke hue hai salmaan?vaise salmaan khan kaa kai actraces sang rishta bana, lekin koi bhi afaire mukammal nahin ho sakaa
 Incomplete relationships have also confused Salman with marriage
 vaise kaiyon kaa ye bhi kahana he ki salmaan khan khud par chal rahe mukademon kii vajah se shaadi nahin kar rahe hai
 In an interview on the question of marriage, Salman had said in a funny way that when all the cases are over me, i will think about marriage
 partner ko vakt naa de paane se darate hai salmaan!khabaren aisi bhi ain ki salmaan kai baar shaadi karne ke kareeb pahunche hai, lekin har baar ve family se zyada mahatv kisi or ko nahin de paaen
 Salman believes that in order to not give space and time to his partner, he has to do wrong with him
 khayr, in dinon bollywood main single pareinting kaa kancept khub trend main he
 Tusshar Kapoor, Ekta Kapoor, Karan Johar are parents through surrogacy
 family saport hone kii vajah se in celebs ko pareinting main madad mil rahi he
 So far there has been no statement from Salman or his family on the news of surrogacy
 lekin shaadi se dur bhaagane vaale dabang khan ke liye sarogesi ke jariye fadarhud ko anubhav karnaa acha opshan he
