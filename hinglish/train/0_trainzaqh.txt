 Understand this game, to know the game happening in the name of Bengal chit-fund, the honesty of the report suggests that before reaching any conclusion, she discovers the processes by which 58 people die due to the attack
 kya pataa in laaparvaahiyon ke kaaran aaj bhi isi tarah kii train durghatnaayen ho rahi hon
 If you are looking for a headline to measure one in this report, then it will be disappointing but this report does not leave any one
 durghatana ke vakt to ghanton charchaa hui
 There was a dispute between the Ministry of Railways versus the Government of Punjab, but when both were found guilty in this report, all of them abandoned it
 91 pannon kii is report ko bahut halke main liya gaya is report ko is tarah ke har aayojak, police, nagarpalika or patrakaron ko padhani chahie
 Because from reading this report, it is known that nobody has any idea about their role
 agar sabko apana kaam pataa hota or ve apana kaam kar rahe hote to 58 log nahin maare jate
 Insurance does not mean hospital and treatment, something else happens
 In the beginning itself, this report examines the claims of eyewitnesses
 75 chashmadidon se baat karne ke baad likhaa gaya he ki zaruri nahin ki jo chashmadid he use saare tathy pataa hon
 Like, what was the time of the accident, people told different things and how many times it was announced from the platform that the people standing on the track should move away, the trains are coming
 kisi ne kaha ki ek baar ghoshnaa hui to kisi ne kaha ki 10 se 15 baar hui
 The same was about the height of the effigy of Ravana and the speed of the train
 yahi nahin nagarpalika, police or railway ke adhikari bhi sahi jawaab nahin de rahe the
 People on track have also not been spared in this report
 likhaa he ki jab samaaj hi marane par amada ho to koi vyavastha roak nahin sakati he
 People themselves should have wondered if there was a place to stand on the railway tracks

 Why these institutions need to know that a public event is taking place
 maine shuru main isiilie kaha ki jab koi patrkaar or ankar is report ko padhegaa to uske sawaal sahi ho jaaenge
 Now the report has been forgotten but it should be included in the journalistic curriculum so that we can properly question the accountability of the officials and organizers at the time of accidents
 dashahra samiti ne ravan dahan ke aayojan kii anumati hi nahin maangi
 Only security, fire extinguishers and water tanks were requested
 aayojakon ne railway ko bhi nahin bataaya or na hi trek par jamaa logon ko vahaan se hataane kaa intazaam kiya
 There is no direct responsibility of the railways, but if the train's arrival time is propagated by the railways, people do not lose their lives
 yah jimmedaari railway kii he ki vah apane trek par surakshit awajahi kii vyavastha rakhe
 The government, which has been dogged by the highest unemployment report in 45 years, has been deeply scrutinized by the role of the municipal and police
 punjab sarkaar kii tamaam kanoonee vyavasthaaon ke anusaar yah nigam kii javabdehi he ki kaarykram kii anumati milane ke pehle sabhasthal kii safai kare or vahaan se har prakaar kii baadha hataa de taaki bhagdad kii sthiti main koi fanse nahin
 No such work was done
 aayojan kii zyaadaatar anumati police ko deni thi
 The organizers had the same permission from the police
 laud spikar lagane kii
 Permission was granted on condition but canceled due to non-compliance
 police ne bhi jaanch nahin kii ki suraksha ke hisaab se sabha sthal sahi he yaa nahin
 The police also did not give any information to the Railways that such a meeting is being held at Dhobi Ghat Maidan

 However, he also said that his star fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman can thwart any preparation for the visiting batsmen
 bharat ke khilaaf asia cap tii20 match ke pehle mukaable se purv bangladesh ke captain ko 20 varshiya baayen haath ke is tej gendbaaj se jude kai sawaalon kaa jawaab dena padaa
 Preparations will not come Kammurtja said, 'slow cutter ball of Mustafiz (murtaza calls him by the same name) has a lot of variations
 mahatvapurn yah he ki vah inhen istemaal karne ko lekar kitna aashwast he
 He does not pay attention to the opposing batsmen and only concentrates on what he can do best
 aap mustafij ke khilaaf taiyaari kar sakate ho
 But it might not work
 ’akele nahin jita saktaa tii20pichley saal bharat ke khilaaf shandaar padaarpan ke baad baayen haath ke is tej gendbaaj ne kaaphi surkhiyaan batori
 But the captain assured that his feet were on the ground
 haalanki murtaja ne chetaya ki tii20 cricket 50 over se alag praaroop he or mustafijur akele bangladesh ko match nahin jita saktaa
 He said, 'this is a different format and Mustafizur cannot win the match for us alone
 anya ko bhi yogadan dena hoga
 Our T20 record is not as spectacular
 lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki ham sudhaar nahin kar sakate
 This tournament is our chance to prepare for the big competition (world T20)
 hamen vifaltaaon se nahin darana chahie
 Kamamurta said that although he won the ODI series last year, he would have to be at the top of his game to defeat a great team like India
 unhone kaha, ‘keval tii20 main hi nahin, bharat kii ballebaaji sabhi praroopon main chunauteepurn he
 So we have to play with confidence, without fear, freedom
 hamen puraa bharosa he ki ham apana sarvshereshth karenge
 'dhoni's focus on Bangla' Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's playing in this match is doubtful but the opposition captains are preparing the strategy keeping Dhoni in mind
 murtaja ne kaha, ‘dhoni bharat ke liye adbhut khilaadi rahe hai, ham sabhi jaanate hai
 The way their batting order is, it will not make much difference to them
 vah behtareen captain or khilaadi he
 We have to make a strategy not only for Mahendra Singh Dhoni, but for everyone
 unka ballebaaji kram laajawab he jo duniya ke behtareen kram se se ek he
 Still planning to keep Dhoni in mind
 ’behtareen hai hamaare sabhi playecentim ekadash ke bare main poochne par captain ne kaha, ‘sabhi 15 khilaadi antim ekadash main shaamil hone ke kaabil hai
 Yes, we will miss Tamim Iqbal, who has played several match-winning innings for Bangladesh

 ' jab aresas ke sah sarkarywah dattatreya hosbale se 2020 ke bharat ke liye aresas ke najariye ke bare main poocha gaya, to hosbale ne kaha, “aise samrudh bharat kaa najariya jahaan nagarikon kii buniyadi jaruratein puri ho jaaen; jahaan jati, dharm yaa langik bhedbhaav maujuud nahin ho
 "hosabale was saying concrete things
 ve chaahate hai ki aresas is drushti ko jameen par utaarne kaa ek prabhavi aujaar bane lekin baat jab aage badhane kii aati he, to badlaav or vakt ke mutabik dhalanaa ahm ho jate hai
 Obviously, change has to be brought from within and the RSS is ready to adopt new ideas in a new environment
 hosbale bhale ek aisa bharat chaahate hon jo apni saanskrithik viraasat or sabhyataagat yogadan par garv karata ho, lekin viraasat ke boj tale aage bad paanaa mumkin nahin he
 That is why the basic thing is clear that change has to happen
 “hindu sabhyataa kahati he ki hamen samay kii jarurat ke hisaab se badalanaa hi hoga
 "hosabale indicated that it is possible that the RSS is no longer a purely men's organization
 unhone mana ki jab areesus bana tha, us vakt saamaajik vaatavaavaran aisa tha ki mahilaon ko sanghathan main aane kii chhot nahin thi kyonki isamen khel jaisi kuch shaareerik gatividhiyaan bhi kii jaati thim
 As time has changed, the RSS also seems to agree to include women in its branches
 haal hi main usne ganavesh ko badla he or khaaki half pant kii jagah puri lambaai kii pant ko sweekaar kiya he
 Today, except for the morning branch in the RSS, women are allowed to participate in every activity
 unhone kaha, “aane vaale ek saal main chijen badal sakati hai
 In some branches, we are also experimenting with the participation of families where men, women and children will all be exempted
 ”aresas ko lekar vyaapt kuch “bhramon” ko dur karne or hindutv ke uske vichaar ko saaf karne ke bhi prayaas jari hai
 Being a Hindu is a way of life
 hosbale ne kaha ki mahatma gandhi hindu hone main garv mahasoos karte the
 Vivekananda was also proud to be a Hindu
 unhone ek hindu bharat ke bare main gaiyr-hinduon ke man main vyaapt dar ko dur karne kii koshish kii, “ateet main hinduon ne duniya bhar main kisi par kabja nahin kiya yaa kisi ko bhi gulam nahin banaaya he
 Hence fear about Hindu aggression is wrong
 ”hosbale ke liye “bharat mata” sabase pavitra he or iskaa naaraa lagane par unke hisaab se koi bahes nahin honi chahie
 He said in the conclave, "if someone does not raise the slogan of" Bharat Mata Ki Jai "then he is anti-national because he is inciting others to do so
 ”sabase bada khulaasa samalangikta par aresas kii badali hui soch thi
 Hosabale said that he did not believe that homosexuality was a punishable offense
 unhone kaha, “jab tak vah dusron ke jivan ko prabhavit nahin karata, vah aparaadh nahin he
 On the issue of eating beef, he did not look as generous, "it is not culturally appropriate in the country
" mahatma gandhi bhi govadh kaa virodh karte the
 So were they communal? ”certain things are beyond the scope of change

 'the Uses of Truth' is a book written by Mahatma Gandhi, which has the status of his autobiography
 baapu ne yah pustak mul rup se gujarati main likhi thi
 Many people translated it into Hindi
 yah kitaab duniya kii sarvaadhik padhi jane vaali kitabon main se ek he
 Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi wrote the 'use of Truth' or 'autobiography' in the twentieth century with the idea of understanding and explaining truth, non-violence and the heart of God
 gandhi ji ne 29 november, 1925 ko is kitaab ko likhnaa shuru kiya tha or 3 farvari, 1929 ko yah kitaab puri hui thi
 The use of truth in understanding Gandhi studies has the status of a major document, which was written by Gandhi himself
 par yah kitnon ko pataa he ki paanch bhaagon main banty is kitaab ke chauthe bhaag ke 18wein adhyay main khud gandhi ji ne us kitaab kaa zikr kiya he, jisane unhen gahare tak prabhavit kiya
 The same chapter for the readers of 'sahitya Aaj Tak' on Gandhiji's death anniversary: the miraculous impact of a book
 This epidemic increased my influence, my business and my responsibility to poor Hindustan
 saath hi, europiyanon ke bich meri badhati hui kuch jaan pahchaan bhi itani nikat kii hoti gayi ki uske kaaran bhi meri jimmedaari badhane lagi
 The way my life was recognized in the West at the Niramishari Meal, it was about Pollack
 ek din jis mej par main baitha tha, usase duusari mej par ek noujvaan bhojan kar rahe the
 He sent me his name card with a desire to meet
 maine unhen mej par aane ke liye nimantrit kiya
 They came
 'main 'critic' kaa up sampadak hum
 After reading your letter about the epidemic, i had a great desire to meet you
 aaj mujhe yah avasar mil rahaa he
 'mr
 pola kii shuddh bhaavana se main unki ore aakarshith hua
 On the very first night, we started to recognize each other and in our thoughts about life, we were shown a lot of equanimity
 unhen sada jivan pasand tha
 Once i understood the power of his ability to implement the thing that his intellect would accept
 unhone apane jivan main kai parivartan to ekadam kar liye
 The cost of 'indian Opinion' kept increasing
 west kii pehali hi report mujhe chaunkaanewaali thi
 He wrote, 'I do not see the profits as you said
 mujhe to nuksaan hi najar aata he
 There is a chaos in the ledger accounts
 ugaahi bahut he, par vah bina sir pair kii he
 Many will have to be manipulated
 par is report se aap ghabaraiye nahin
 i will try my best to organize everything
 munafa nahin he, iske liye main is kaam ko chhoduunga nahin
 'if West wanted, he could have left work seeing that there was no profit and i could not blame him in any way
 yahi nahin, balki bina jaanch padtaal kiye ise munafewala kaam bataane kaa dosha mujh par lagane kaa unhen adhikaar tha
 Despite all this, she never even told me bitter words
 par main maanata hum ki is nai jaankaree ke kaaran west kii drushti main meri gitni un logon main hui hogi, jo jaldi main dusron kaa vishwaas kar lete hai
 Without questioning Madanjeet's belief, i had spoken to West about the profits by trusting him
 meraa khyaal he ki saarvajanik kaam karne vaale ko aisa vishwaas na rakhkar vahi baat kehani chaiye jisaki usne swayan jaanch kar lee ho
 The priest of truth must be very careful
 puure vishwaas ke bina kisi ke man par aavashyaktaa se adhik prabhaav daalana bhi satya ko laanchit karnaa he
 i feel sad to say that despite knowing this fact, i could not completely improve my nature of taking up work by believing in a hurry
 isamen main apni shakti se adhik kaam karne ke laabh ko dosha dekhtaa hum
 Due to this greed, my colleagues have had to be more restless than i have been restless
 west kaa aisa patr aane se main netaal ke liye ravaanaa hua
 Pollock had started knowing all my things
 ve mujhe chhodane stesan tak aaye or yah kahkar ki 'yah raste main padhane yogya he, aap ise pard jaaiye, aapako pasand aayegi,' unhone ruskin kii 'antu dis last' pustak mere haath main rakh di
 After taking this book in my hand, i could not leave
 isane mujhe pakad liya
 The route from Johannesburg to Natal was about twenty-four hours
 train shaam ko durban pahunchati thi
 After reaching there, i could not sleep all night
 maine pustak main suchit vichaaron ko amal main laane ko iraadaa kiya
 i had not read a single book by Ruskin before that
 vidyadhyayan ke samay main pathyapustakon ke baahar kii meri padhai lagbhag nahin ke baraabar maani jaaegi
 After entering Karmabhoomi, there was very little time left
 aaj bhi yahi kaha ja saktaa he
 My book knowledge is very low
 main maanata hum ki is anayas athwa barabas paale gayi sanyam se mujhe koi haani nahin hui, balki jo thodi pustaken main pard paaya hum, kaha ja saktaa he ki unhen main thik se hajam kar sakaa hum
 Among these books, which made creative changes of immediate importance in my life, it can be called 'unto this last'
 baad main maine uskaa gujarati anuwaad kiya auki vah 'sarvoday' naam se chapa
 i believe that the thing that was hidden deep inside me, i saw his reflection in Ruskin's Grantharatna, and because of this he made his empire on me and made me execute in him
 jo manushya hamamen soyi hui uttam bhaawanaaon ko jaagrath karne kii shakti rakhata he, vah kavi he
 Not all poets have the same effect on all people, because they do not have the same amount of goodwill within everyone
 main 'sarvoday' ke siddhanton ko is prakaar samajha hum:1
 Our good lies in the good of all 2
 vakil or nai donon ke kaam kii keemat ek si honi chaiye, kyonki aajeevika kaa adhikaar sabko ek samaan he3
 The first thing i knew was the simple life, the life of the farmer, the true life
 duusari ko dhundle rup main dekhtaa tha
 i had never considered the third
 'sarvoday' ne mujhe diye kii tarah dikhaa diya ki pehali cheez main duusari chijen samaayi hui hai
 It was morning and i tried to implement these principles
 dilli ke mukhyamantri aravind kejariwal ke anshan kaa aaj paanchavaa din he
 Kejriwal is accompanied by deputy CM Manish Sisodia, ministers Satyendar Jain and Gopal Rai on a dharna in the Lieutenant Governor's office
 mantriyon ke anshan kii vajah se alji anil baijal pichley 4 din se ghar se kaam kar rahe hai
 Now amidst the siege of PM Awas, Aam Aadmi Party has announced that Aam Aadmi Party workers will surround PM Awas on Sunday
 party ne elaan kiya ki uparajyapal sun nahin rahe hai
 So now the matter will be sent to PM
 party ne elaan kiya ki shaam 5 baje rashan kii home delivery ke liye sabhi vidhayak chaaval kaa ek packet pradhanmantri ko parcel bhejenge
 You will be told not to stop rationing the people of Delhi
 kejariwal ke dharne kaa paanchvaan diservind kejariwal ne subah twit kar kaha ki anshan ke baavjood bhi alji sahab se koi jawaab nahin mila he
 He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also sought to intervene in this matter, but there was no response from his side either
 kejariwal ne ummid jataai ki jald hi dilli ko koi samaadhaan milegaa
 Good morning is the fourth day of Satyendar's fast
 manish ji ke anshan kaa teesraa din he
 Yesterday, i asked for an appointment with LG Sahib
 unhone jawaab bhi nahin diyapradhanmantri ji se hastkshep karne kaa aagrah kiya
 He too did not reply
 Hope Delhi will get a solution soon- Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) June 15, 2018 Minister Satyendar Jain has also tweeted and appealed to Prime Minister Modi to intervene in the matter
 siem kejariwal kii ore se bhi pradhanmantri ko ek chitti likhi gai he
 On the other hand, CM Kejriwal's wife Sunita has also been entered
 sunita ne guuruuvaar ko aarope lagaaya ki somvaar subah se uparajyapal sachivalay main dharne par baithe mantriyon ke parijanon ko unase milane kii anumati nahin di ja rahi he
 Respected LG sir, are we four ladies, mother and wife of CM, wife of Dy CM and wife of Satyendar Jain threat to your security that you are not allowing us to enter the road leading to your house? Kindly intervene
 Please do not feel so threatened by everyone

 In this case, sources in the LG office say that relatives of ministers can meet them outside the Lt
 Governor's office, as there is no restriction on such meetings

 About four months ago, 11 dead bodies came out from a house in Burari area of delhi
 tab se lekar ab tak ek hi sawaal harek ke zehan main kaundh rahaa tha ki in 11 mauton kaa sach kuya he? zyaadaatar log ye maanane ke tauyar hi nahin the ki ek hi ghar ke 11 log ek saath yun bhi khudakushi kar sakate hai
 Four months after this dreadful accident, now in this case, the Delhi Police has made a very shocking disclosure
 khulaasa ye ki buraadi ke us ghar main us raat jo kuch bhi hua wo naa to katl tha or naa hi khudakushi, balki wo sirf ek haadasa tha
 You will remember that house of Burari
 jahaan ek hi parivaar ke 11 sadsyfaansee ke fandaper latake paae gaye the, wo bhi murda
 a register was found in the investigation from there
 jisamen likhaa tha- aakhri samay par jhatka lagegaa, aasmaan hilegaa, dharti hilegi
 
 lekin tum ghabraana mat, mantra jaap tej kar dena, main tumhe bachaa luungaa
 Getting down when the water changes color, helping each other down
 tum maroge nahin, balki kuch bada hasil karoge
 But no one came to save them and that house with 11 corpses became a crematorium in one stroke
 ye raaj
 
 raaj hi rah gaya ki 30 june or 1 july 2018 kii us darmiyaani raat ko aakhir hua kya tha
 It was also clear from the post-mortem report that there was no coercion of anyone
 lihaaza krime branch ne maare gaye logon kii dimagi haalat jaanane ke liye psychological atopsi bhi karai
 Now this psychological atopsy report has come out
 psychological atopsi main bada khulasadesh or duniya ko hilaa dene vaale 11 logon kii maut ke is cond ko sulajhane ke liye dilli police kii krime branch ne koi pahalu nahin choda
 
 or aakhirkaar kareeb 4 maheene baad krime branch is nattejey par pahunchi he ki 1 july 2018 ko hua buraadi cond khudakushi nahin balki haadasa tha
 
 darasal krime branch ne buraadi ke is makaan main mili 11 laashon ke dimag kii psychological atopsi karwaai thi
 
 jisaki exclusive report kii kapi aaj tak ke paas he
 
 khudakushi nahin haadasa thi 11 logon kii mautji, yahi psychological enlasis report he, jisamen saaf likhaa he ki psychological atopsi se pataa chalaa he ki buraadi cond suicide nahin balki puja ke dauraan hua ek haadasa tha
 None of the members involved in this accident knew that they would die while doing so
 to sawaal ye ki jis puja kaa zikr us din maare gaye tamaam logon ke dimagi jaanch ke baad kiya gaya
 What was that worship after all? ise jaanane ke liye is parivaar ke itihaas main janaa padegaa
 50 years ago
 sava gaanv, chittorgarh, rajasthanbhopal singh ko narayani devi itani bhain kii unhone unase shaadi karne kaa faisla kar liya
 Fearing that his father would not believe, Bhopal Singh left Haryana and went to Haryana
 narayani devi se unki shaadi hui or teen bete or do betiyaan huin
 23 years ago
 santnagar, buraadi, dillibhopal singh ne dilli main basane kaa faisla kiya
 Started plywood work in Delhi city
 kaam chal niklaa or kuch saalon main santnagar main khud kii ye imaarat khadi lee
 10 years ago
 santnagar, buraadi, dillibhopal singh kaa puraa parivaar dilli settle ho chukaa tha
 But then suddenly Bhopal Singh died
 bhopal singh kii maut ke baad chota betaa dinesh rajasthan laut gaya or ravatbhata main rahane laga
 Whereas, 11 people of the family now live in Santnagar house in Delhi
 parivaar main 78 saal kii nayarani devi
 50-year-old elder son Bhuvanesh alias Bhuppi
 48 saal kii uski patni savita
 Three children Neetu, Moni and Dhrav
 bhopal singh kaa 45 saal kaa chota betaa lalit
 Lalit's wife Tina, 42 years old
 lalit kaa betaa sivam
 Pratibha, 57-year-old widow of Bhopal Singh
 or pratibha kii 33 saal kii beti priyanka
 Being a young son, Lalit was dear to his father from the beginning
 baap kii maut kaa sabase zyaada sadma bhi use hi laga tha
 a few years after the death of Bhopal Singh, Lalit's voice also lost in an accident
 pita kii maut or awaz ke chale jane se lalit puri tarah se tut chukaa tha
 His voice did not return even after considerable treatment
 parivaar ke karibiyon ke mutabik isi dauraan lalit ne ghar waalon ko bataanaa shuru kiya ki use uske pita bhopal singh dikhaai dete hai
 They also talk to them
 uske iffndhvishwasamen use saath mila uski patni tina kaa
 Which was already very religious
 vakt gujarata gaya or lalit ko ab aae din uske pita dikhaai dene lage
 The limit was reached when he started listening and obeying his orders
 yahaan tak ki ab wo apane pita kii hi hoobahoo awaz nikaalane laga
 According to the register from home, one day Lalit's father ordered him to meet the family
 "aakhri samay par jhatka lagegaa, aasmaan hilegaa, dharti hilegi
 
 lekin tum ghabraana mat, mantra jaap tej kar dena, main tumhe bachaa luungaa
 
 
 Getting down when the water changes color, helping each other down
 
 
 tum maroge nahin, balki kuch bada hasil karoge
 "such things were written in the register which the police have recovered from this house
 register main likhi har baat lalit likh rahaa tha
 The story did not end here
 lalit pita se milane ke baad ab isi register main bhagwaan se milane kii bhi baat karne laga
 The police was the only one who was writing the father's orders not only in the register
 balki use hoobahoo puraa bhi kar rahaa tha
 But the voice that promised Lalit to save everyone
 usne bachaaya hi nahin
 Actually there was no such voice
 ye to bas lalit kaa vaham tha
 Which was heard due to an illness
 us raat lalit ne hi sabhi ke haath-pair, ankhen band kar di thim
 Then, in the same mood, the whole family was strangled and everyone was killed while not hanging

 vetres ne aarope lagaaya tha ki pradhanmantri jon kii jab uske cafe main aae, to unhone skool ke 'ziddee chaatr' kii tarah suluk karte hue uski baalo kii chotii kai baar khinchi
 The anonymous Auckland waitress did not reveal her name, but she called the leftist website thedailyblog

 Putting his side in an anonymous column in nz said that what the conservative leader did, spilled his tears
 vetres ne kaha he ki jon kii ne kam se kam chah alag-alag baar uske bal khinche
 According to the waitress, each time she expressed her displeasure and warned them that if this series continued, she would punch
 usne likhaa he ki ek baar to jon kii kii patni bronu ne apane pati se kaha ki bechaari ladki ko jane do, lekin pradhanmantri ne aisa jaahir kiya, maano unhen is baat kii parvaah hi nahin he
 In the blog, the waitress wrote, "he was behaving like a stubborn schoolboy harassing a little girl
 ' usne aage likhaa he ki achaanak pichley maah jon kii ne ek sandesh ke jariye usase maafee maangi or kaha ki unhen ahsaas nahin tha ki use unka vyavhaar itnaa bura lagegaa
 The Prime Minister's Office of John Key stated that the Prime Minister has apologized to the waitress

 upi ke siyaasi samar main jeet kaa paracham lahraane ke liye congress ab 1857 kii kranti ke vakt angrejon ke daant khattey karne vaale krantikariyon ko raajnneetik hathiyaar banane kii taiyaari main he
 According to sources, the Congress wants to emphasize on the discussion that in 1857 jung-e-azadi, King Uday Pratap Narayan Singh of Rudrapur met the revolutionaries of the neighboring neighborhood and fought the British
 congress kii ranneeti he ki angrejon se ladaai ko ahm mudda banaaya jaae
 At the time of the revolution of 1857, when the British attacked the legacy of Rudrapar, then Maharaj Udit Pratap Narayan Singh of Rudrapur, along with the revolutionaries of Gorakhpur, did not only sour the teeth of the British in the first phase of the battle, but also known as the Rapti stream
 The mere 15-km river to be renamed is 'gurra'
 veeron ne angrejon ko itnaa kaata ki rapti kii dhara unke khun se laal ho gai
 It was the anger, growling and warmth of the revolutionaries that this stream of Rapti was named Gurra and it is still known by this name
 angreji sena ne baad main raja ko giraftaar kar kaala pani kii sajaa de di thi, lekin tab bhi angrejon se haar ke baavjood ilaake main gurur jhalkata he
 Gurra, Congress, Independence and BJP Actually, the strategy of the Congress in this whole matter is that the fight with the British, along with everything else in the area, should be made an important issue
 tabhi ilaake se congress ko kareeb bataate hue aamajan ko ye bataaya jaae ki is ilaake main congress or yahaan ke raja kaa angrejon ke khilaaf ladaai main bada yogadan he
 Then the Congress should also remind everyone of their participation in the freedom struggle
 jiske baad congress aresas or bijepi par nishaanaa sadhakar bataae ki aazaadee kii ladaai main ye log angrejon ke saath the or aaj deshbhakti kaa pramaan patr congress se maang rahe hai
 Rahul will pass through the bridge across the Gurra river, the Congress is out of power in UP for 27 years and is ready to attack BJP and RSS by adding any page of history
 tabhi rahul gandhi kii yatra ko gurraa nadi se hokar gujaarna tay kiya gaya he
 However, on this matter, Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap says that the land which had chewed the British in 1857 is of revolutionaries and the Congress will fight the British
 lekin aaj deshbhakti certificate wo baant rahe hai, jo aazaadee kii ladaai ke vakt angrejon ke saath the

 Senior advocate and jurisprudential Ram Jethmalani today moved the Supreme Court against the Governor's decision to invite BJP to form the government in Karnataka
 unhone rajyapal ke faisle ko ‘‘ sanvaidhanik shakti kaa ghor durupyog ’’ bataaya
 a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra considered the Jethmalani petition filed for immediate hearing and said that a three-member special bench to hear the case will be heard tomorrow
 nyaayamurti e em khanvilkar or nyaayamurti di vaai chandrachud kii peeth ne varisht adhivaktaa se kaha ki vah nyaayamurti e ke sikri kii aguwai vaali teen sadasyeey peeth ke samaksh 18 may ko apni yachika daayar karen, jab congress party or janata dal ( secular ) kii yachikaaon par sunwaayee hogi
 On the political upheaval of Karnataka, Jethmalani said that this is an insult to the Constitution and i have no doubt that the Governor has acted on the advice of Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha ki main beeti baat nahin karnaa chahta, lekin meri jindagi kaa ek makasad puraa nahin hua he or wo modi se mukti paane kaa

 Corruption is being openly promoted, they can gain votes only by damaging democracy
 aazaadee ke andolan main jawahar laal nehru or sardaar patel agar kandhe se kandhaa milakar chale to aaazaad bharat kii raajnneeti ne unhen aamane-saamne khadaa kar diya
 History asked the question whether Nehru was great or Patel? Similarly, in slave India, Mahatma Gandhi and Babasaheb Ambedkar shared similar views on many issues
 donon ne gulaami kii zanjeeron ko todane kii purajor vakaalat kii or donon ne aaazaad bharat kii ek pariklpana desh ke saamne rakhi jiske chalate aazaadee ke lagbhag saat dashak baad bhi donon kii praasangikta bani hui he
 But even in the context of this historical pair, the question is asked from history that why Ambedkar and Gandhi were different? 1
 ambedkar or gandhi kabhi kisiraajnneetik dalmen ek saath nahin rahe
 In the 1920s in the days of slavery, Ambedkar returned to India after completing his studies abroad
 us vakt tak gandhi congress kii aguwai main aazaadee ke andolan main apni pahchaan bana chuke the
 2
 gramin bharat, jati pratha or chuaa-chhot ke muddon par ambedkar or gandhi kii pahchaan ek duusare kaa virdohi hone kii bani
 However, both tried to make the country based on social justice and unity and both showed different ways for these purposes
 3
 According to Gandhi, if the curse like untouchability is removed from the caste system, then the whole system can work in the interest of society
 isaki taarkik avadharana ke liye gandhi ne gaanv ko ek purna samaaj bolte hue vikaas or unnati ke kendra main rakhaa
 4
 gandhi ke ulat ambedkar ne jati vyavastha ko puri tarah se nasht karne kaa mat saamne rakhaa
 According to Ambedkar, as long as the caste system exists in the society, curses like touching and touching will continue to flourish in the society in a new way
 5
 Gandhi advocated people to move to the village for full development
 gandhi ke mutabik desh kii itani badi jansankhya kaa pet sirf industry yaa factory ke jariye nahin bharaa ja saktaa he
 For this it is necessary that industrial development be developed keeping the center of rural economy
 6
 Ambedkar appealed to the people to leave the village and move to the cities
 ambedkar ke mutabik gaanv ko chhodana isliye jaruri he kyonki aarthik unnati or behatar shiksha sirf shaharon main mil sakati he or bina iske dalit samaaj ko vikaas ke chakra main laana naammumkin he
 7
 gandhi satyagrah main bharosa karte the
 He inspired the upper castes for Satyagraha
 unka maananaa tha ki chuaa-chhot jaise abhishaap ko khatm karne kaa bidaa oonchi jatiyon ke log uthaa sakate hai
 For this he kept many agitations and fasts, after which many temples were opened to all
 8
 Ambedkar believed that Satyagraha is completely baseless
 unke mutabik satyagrah ke raste oonchi jati ke hinduon kaa hriday parivartan nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki jati pratha se unhen bhautik laabh hota he or is laabh kaa tyaag vah nahin kar sakate
 9
 mahatma gandhi rajya main adhik shaktiyon ko nihit karne ke virdohi the
 His effort was to get more and more powers enshrined in the society and for this he was in favor of making the village the main unit of power

 petroleum evam prakritik gas mantri dharmendra pradhan ne petroleum kshetra main nivesh badhaane ke liye khuli bazaar niti par jor diya he
 He said that the market price of petroleum products should be in line with their cost of production and subsidy should be given only to poor families
 pradhan ne bharat aarthik shikhar sammelan main yahaan kaha, ‘‘petroleum padaarthon kaa bazaar mulya unke utpaadan mulya ke kareeb hona chahie
 We should adopt a market system in this area
 sarkaar ko daam niyantran main nahin rakhane chahie
 The minister also said that to increase investor confidence and increase the participation of private investors in the energy sector, the price of petroleum products should be deregulated and their pricing should be in line with the market
 unka maananaa he ki sabsidi samaapt kiye bina desh main petroleum padaarthon kaa utpaadan nahin badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 He said that to increase the confidence of investors, it is necessary that subsidy should be given only to the needy
 yah sabhi ko nahin di ja sakati he
 He said that there should be a debate on this issue
 vartmaan main sarkaar kerosine or rasoi gas (alpiji) par sabsidi detii he
 The government is encouraging consumers to give up LPG subsidy so that it can be given to poor families living below the poverty line
 tippaniyan Pradhan also said that the use of renewable energy like solar and wind energy will increase in the coming years and their participation in energy resources will increase
 unhone krishi apshisht ko urja main badalane par bhi jor diya
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) "the market price of petroleum products should be close to their production value," Pradhan said here at the India Economic Summit
 hamen is kshetra main bazaar pranali ko apnaanaa chahie
 Government should not keep prices under control
 ’’ mantri kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki niveshkon ke vishwaas ko badhaane or urja kshetra main nijee niveshkon kii bhagidaari badhaane ke liye petroleum padaarthon ke daam niyantran mukt hone chahie or inkaa nirdhaaran bazaar ke anuroop hona chahie
 He believes that production of petroleum products cannot be increased in the country without ending the subsidy
 unhone kaha ki niveshkon kaa vishwaas badhaane ke liye yah jaruri he ki sabsidi keval jaruratmand ko hi di jaye
 It cannot be given to everyone
 unhone kaha ki is mudde par bahes honi chaiye

 com / 91yeznj3hi noida main nithari kii kothi kaa darwaja khulaa tha to 21 ladakiyon kii chikhen sunai deen
 At the same time 48 girls girls came out from Muzaffarpur girl house
 or ab meerut kii ek kothi ne apane andar se thik nithari or mujffatpur kii tarah hi ek khaufnak sach ugala he
 The owner of Sach Kothi is a retired government officer
 us afasar kaa jisane kothi ke har kone main camere laga rakhe the
 And who used to call innocent girls in the cell between those cameras and then erase their lust with them
 meerut ke is vahashi darinde kii kahani jisane bhi suni bas sann rah gaya
 On May 3, 2019, the district court, Meerut Shukruwar, covered the face with a handkerchief as soon as the person walks out of the court
 baahar khadi public usapar tut padati he
 Someone started slapping
 koi laat maar rahaa tha
 Somebody started punches and those who could not reach it also started sending curse on this person from behind
 tivi camere ise chaaron taraf se ghere hue the
 The situation became such that the police had to run from the court to save this person
 adaalat main aage-aage police is shaks ko lekar daud rahi thi
 Back to the common people as well as lawyers were rushing to beat it
 ab sawaal ye tha ki aakhir is shaks ne aisa kiya kya ki court main maujuud tamaam log ise maar daalane par amada the
 So the answer is that this person committed the same sin
 jo noida ke nithari main surendra kohli or moninder singh pandher ne kiya
 Brajesh Thakur did it inside the girl's home in Muzaffarpur, Bihar
 vahi meerut ke jagriti vihaar ke is shaks ne kiya
 The allegations may be false
 magar tasviren jhooth nahin bolti hai
 More photos show that the accused Vimal Chand, who retired from a government job, is about 70 years as a human being
 apni havas bujhane ke liye isane maasoom naaballig ladakiyon ke saath-saath balig ladakiyon kii bhi majaburi se khelaa or unhen apni havas kaa shikaar banaaya
 Those pictures are so embarrassing that we can't even show you
 wo tamaam tasviren meerut main aaropee vimal chand ke jagrati vihaar vaali kothi main lage sisitivi camere se ricard kii gai hai
 Vimal Chand, retired from LIC, had installed more than half a dozen cameras in his entire house
 ye camere bedroom se lekar kichan tak
 From the main gate to the lobby and to the bathroom
 sutron ke mutabik ye camere aaropee ne isliye lagava rakhe the
 So that if the girls refuse to obey him or try to expose him
 to in tasveeron ke zarie unhen blackmel kar sake
 The police accused Vimal Chand ruined the lives of so many girls, it is not yet known exactly
 magar poochtacha main jo khulaase hue uske mutabik is vahashi ne teen naaballig or teen balig ladakiyon ko apni havas kaa shikaar banaaya he
 However, the police are quite sure that there may be many more girls apart from this
 lihaaza iti export ke zarie police sisitivi ko khangaalane kaa kaam kar rahi he
 Not only this, before the physical exploitation of small girls, they used to show them dirty videos on mobile and laptop
 agar koi bacchee virodh karti to unhen ye paise or kapadon kaa laalach diya karata tha
 If nobody still believed
 to ye in tasveeron or video ko saarvajanik karne kii dhamkee dekar unka munh band kara detaa tha
 This hideous game inside Kothi had been going on for a long time
 or is khel kaa pardaafash bhi naa hua hota
 Had the CCTV of the house not gone bad and the hard disk would not have been seen by a mechanic
 2 may se pehle meerut ke jagrati vihaar kii kothi number 162 kii ilaake main bahut izzat thi
 Vimal, the head of the household, retired as an officer in LIC
 patni bhi adhikari thim
 But 9 years ago, Vimal lived alone in Kothi after the death of his wife and the daughter's going abroad after marriage
 or yaheen se uske vahashipan kii kahani shuru hoti he
 Feeding girls in temples
 unhen skool kii dress dene
 By distributing chocolates and paying money, he started hunting poor girls
 2 may 2019guruuvar kii tadake subah jagrati vihaar ke kothi number 162 se achaanak aawaaj aane lagi
 People next door also opened their eyes
 is badi si kothi se meerut kii medical thane kii police ghar ke maalik vimal chand ko pakad kar le ja rahi thi
 Every man was surprised as to why the police are taking the 70-year-old Vimal Chand away from the house in such a way
 kyonki vimal chand kii naa sirf mohalle me izzat thi balki wo garibon ke madadgaar ko taur par bhi janaa jaataa tha
 After the death of his wife and the marriage of his only daughter 9 years ago, he lived alone in this kothi
 padosiyon kii maane to wo behad dharmik bhi thi
 Often the temple used to come and go
 jahaan wo garibon main khaanaa baantta
 Apart from feeding this food to poor girls, they used to give them chocolate too
 puure jagrati vihaar ko pataa tha ki elisi se ritaryad vimal chand garib bacchiyon ko hameshaa khaanaa, kapadaa or paise baanta karata tha
 This was also the modus operandi of this man
 khud ko kai baar to ye saamaajik kaaryakarta bhi bataata tha or logon se hamadardi jataakar unki maasoom, bholi-bhali betiyon ko bahala-phusalaakar apana shikaar bana letaa
 Often he would lure the girls to his house and then take advantage of his innocence and naivety and start abusive behavior with them
 ek baar jo silsilaa shuru hota to phir maheenon chalata rahata
 According to sources, the accused Vimal had been executing these abusive acts in his own house for the last 2 years
 har bacchee ko ghar laakar unke saath ghinauni harakat karnaa aasaan nahin tha
 There was also a danger of being caught
 lihaaza vimal apane puure ghar main sisitivi lagaakar uski footage ko apane paas hathiyaar ke taur par rakhata tha
 Not only this, he had also made his maid a partner in this sin
 jo aksar use kothi main kaam karne ke naam par ladkiyaan laakar detii thi
 CCTV footage also proves that the maid was also involved in the entire episode
 ilaake ke logon kaa kahana he ki kuch saal pehle vimal ne apane is ghar main garib bachche-bacchiyon kaa muft ilaaj karnaa shuru karavaaya tha
 But it is possible that his motive was not being fulfilled by him
 isliye wo mandir main or mohalle main garib bacchiyon main paise
 Started distributing clothes and food
 jisaki vajah se iske ghar ke saamne bachche bacchiyaan khud ba khud line lagaakar khadey hone lage
 Which made Vimal's work easier
 uske is ghinaune khel kaa shikaar bani zyaadaatar bacchiyaan darasal garib gharon se thim
 That's why she easily got caught in his hoax
 haalanki is maamle main abhi tak kisi bhi bacchee ke gharavaale police main exiaar likhaane ke liye saamne nahin aae hai
 In this case, questions are also being raised on the medical police station
 logon kaa kahana he ki aaropee vimal police kii naak ke neeche ye ghinauna kaam karata rahaa or police ko isaki bhanak tak kaise nahin lagi
 According to sources, some time ago a person had also expressed apprehension to the police about this abusive game running in Kothi number 162
 magar police ke gairzimmedaarana ravaiyye kii vajah se maasoom bacchiyaan vimal kii havas kaa shikaar banati raheen
 Now the question is how the secret of Vimal Chand, who has been playing since the childhood of the girls, was revealed
 darasal bedroom samet usne apane puure ghar main kareeb 13 sisitivi camere lagava rakhe the
 These cameras were installed with the intention that if girls ever tried to open their mouths, they could be blackmailed by showing them pictures
 magar jin camaron ke zarie wo bacchiyon ko blackmel karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha usee camere kii tasviren koi or chori chupe dekh rahaa tha
 As the CCTV footage of such an open situation is being investigated, the acts of Arrest Retire Insurance Officer Vimal Chand are being exposed in the case of sexual exploitation of girls in Meerut
 aaiye ab aapako bataate hai ki bacchiyon ke bachapan se khilne vaale ke paap kaa gadaa phuta kaise
 Actually, this person did not just make innocent people a victim of their lust
 balki puure ghar main lage 13 sisitivi camere uski harkaton kii tasviir bhi banaate the
 Which not only became the means of his blackmailing
 balki wo unhen baad main dekha bhi karata tha
 The secret was revealed when out of these 13 cameras, the CCTV camera installed in the bedroom went bad and entered the house, the same technician who had installed these 13 cameras in this kothi
 haalanki camera technician kii niyat par sawaal isliye uth rahe hai kyonki jo video wo aaj dikhaa rahe hai wo kareeb 6 se 7 maheene purana he or police kaa aarope he ki wo is video ke zarie dushkarm ke aaropee vimal chand ko blackmel kar rahaa tha
 Vimal Chand's hideous scandal refreshed Nithari's wounds
 magar police bhi vimal ko bakhshane ke mood main nahin he
 So, with the CCTV camera footage and the counseling of the girls, Sara is engaged in destroying the secret
 andeshaa he ki 17 se zyaada bacchiyon ke saath aaropee vimal ne darindagi kii he

 supreme court ne somvaar ko aitihaasik faisla sunaate hue ek mahila ko 24 hafte ke bhrun ke garbhpaat kii ijaajat de di
 The court granted this permission to the woman under Section-5 of the MTP Act
 yah nirnay sarvocch nyaayalay kii ore se gathit saat keiem medical college kii 7 sadasyeey cameti kii report ke baad liya gaya
 The committee said in the report that there was no threat to the life of the woman
 cameti ne kaha ki bhrun chikitsiya asaamanyataon ke saath peedit he
 The fetus has neither a skull nor a liver
 iske saath hi bhran kii aant bhi sharir ke baahar se bad rahi he
 The panel reported that this fetus would not survive at birth
 lekin agar mahila bachche ko janm detii he to uski jaan ko khatra he
 'possibility of misuse of law also' Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, appearing on behalf of the Central Government, said, "in this case, the Center can allow abortion under Section 5 of the MTP Act, because in this case the mother's life can be There is danger baaki kii dhaaraon ko lekar ham abhi kuch nahin kahana chahenge, kyonki ye ek behad gambhir maamla he
 There is a possibility of misuse of the law on giving concession in view of female feticide
 ''maa kii jaan ko khatra ek apwaad'supreme court ne medical board kii report or atorni general kii daleelon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kaha kii ham MTP act kii dhara-5 ke tahat garbhpaat kii ijaajat dete hai
 There are some exceptional circumstances in Section 5, in which abortion can be allowed even after 20 weeks
 maa kii jaan ko khatra aisa hi ek apwaad he
 Justices JS Kehar and Justice Deepak Mishra have asked the petitioner to appear before the Bench which is hearing the already filed petition on constitutional validity of several sections of the MTP Act for hearing other constitutional issues raised in the petition
 anuvaanshik beemaari se peedit he bhrungauratalab he ki 24 hafte ke bhrun kegarbhpaat kii manghkarne vaali mahila kii yachika par supreme court ne centre or maharashtra sarkaar ko notice jari kiya tha
 The court said that it would give orders in the case only after seeing the medical report

 Along with intestinal problems, fetal brain is also not developing

 The woman who petitioned for abortion up to 20 weeks of fetus, had filed a petition demanding the court to review the law of abortion for 20 weeks
 yachika main medical termination of pregnancy (amtipi) act kii dhara 3(bi) ko chunauti di gai
 It was demanded that it be declared unconstitutional
 is dhara ke mutabik, kaai bhi 20 hafte ke baad garbhpaat nahin kara saktaa
 According to the petition, when this law was made in 1971, even though this section can be justified, today it is not justified
 aisi aadhunik takanic maujuud hai, jisase 26 hafte ke baad bhi garbhpaat karavaaya ja saktaa he
 These sections of the law were given in the challenge, it was said in the document that many serious genetic disorders in the fetus can be detected only after 20 weeks
 isliye 20 hafte ke baad garbhpaat kii ijaajat na hona behad sakht or anuchit he
 It also violates Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution
 yachika main amtipi act kii dhara-5 kii sanvaidhanik vaidhata ko bhi chunauti di gai thi
 Doctors in hospitals make very narrow sense of this stream
 20 hafte baad agar kisi anuvaanshik vikaar kaa pataa chalata he or koi mahila garbhpaat karwaanaa chaahati he to bhi wo is dhara ke kaaran garbhpaat nahin karvaa sakati

 com Narendra Shah, who has shown the skills of media management in Gujarat, and Amit Shah, in charge of bjp's Uttar Pradesh affairs, has started circulating newspapers offices in UP at the behest of Modi
 mana ja rahaa he ki modi ke ishaare par hi amit shah media ko saadhane main jute hue hai
 Before the crucial BJP meeting in Ayodhya, Amit Shah visited the editors of several prominent newspapers in the capital and met the editors on Friday
 mana ja rahaa he ki unki yah sari kavayad modi ke ishaare par ho rahi he, taaki unki baithkon or upi main party kii ranneeti ko lekar sakaaratmak kawarej ho sake
 Amit Shah arrived in the capital Lucknow on Friday afternoon, a day before the meeting to be held in Ayodhya on Saturday
 bijepi sutron ke mutabik, shah ne pehle se hi yah kaarykram tay kar rakhaa tha ki ve is daure kii shuruyaat chuninda akhabaaron ke sampadakon ke saath mulaakaat se karenge, lihaaja dopaher main rajdhani pahunchate hi ve media prabharee or pravaktaaon kii team ke saath lakhanu kii media ko saadhane nikal pade
 BJP leaders and activists are not saying anything openly, but so much is coming out of the mouth of the leaders that whatever Shah does as the party in-charge, but instead of circling the offices of newspapers, focusing on the organization better
 Happen
 bijepi ke ek netaa ne kaha, 'akhabaaron ke daftaron main jaakar sampadakon se milanaa, acchhee parampara kii shuruyaat nahin he
 This will send a wrong message to the general public
 akhabaaron ke daftar ke chakkar lagane se party ko kuch nahin milegaa
 Shah should focus on the organization
 'party ke kuch padaadhikariyon ke bheetar is baat kii khushi bhi dikhaai di ki aakhir modi kaa media management yahaan bhi dekhne ko mil rahaa he, lekin aane vaale samay main iskaa kitna laabh milegaa, iskaa jawaab in padaadhikariyon ke paas bhi nahin he
 When the Naxalite attack in Dantewada was discussed in the Lok Sabha today, there was a ruckus between the Opposition and the government regarding relations with Maoists, due to which the House had to be adjourned several times
 bhaajapa netaa yashavanth sinha ne yah aarope lagaate hue barre ke chhatey main haath daal diya ki congress ne andhra pradesh main naksaliyon se ‘haath milakar’ chunaav jeeta tha
 After this there was strong opposition from the ruling party
 sansadeey kaary mantri pawan kumaar bansal or congress ke kai sadasyon ne palatwaar karte hue aarope lagaaya ki kuch rajyon kii bhaajapa sarkaron ke bhi naksaliyon se rishte hai
 Several members of the Congress stood in their place in protest against Sinha's charge and BJP members also retaliated
 is par loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar ne kaha ki sadan main kaaphi gambhir mudde par charchaa ho rahi he
 This is not the time to make allegations, but to discuss together how all parties can deal with this problem in a better way
 unhone sinha se yah bhi kaha ki vah aise aarope na lagaayen, jinaki vah pushti na kar saken
 Earlier, Sinha had Union Home Minister P
K
 chidambaram kaa samarthan karte hue congress mahasachiv digvijay singh kii un tippaniyon kii aalochana kii jisamen unhone kaha he ki chidambaram is samasya se kanoon vyavastha ke najariye se nipatane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Sinha questioned that while the opposition is with the government in the matter of fighting the Naxalites, is the Congress and UPA also with the government in this fight? The BJP leader said that Singh wrote an article on the editorial page in a newspaper just a day before the Parliament session resumed and 'challenged the entire policy of the government to deal with the Maoists' problem
 ’ unhone kaha ki vah (digvijay singh) samuhik jimmedaari kii baat kar rahe hai or jab ek varisht netaa or congress kaa ek padaadhikari is tarah kii chunauti de to vah na sirf grih mantri ko, balki puri sarkaar ko chunauti de rahe hai
 Apparently referring to the Trinamool Congress, Sinha said that the ruling coalition itself is not united
 unhone kaha ki sattarudh gathbandhan gambhir rup se banta hua he
 There are some people in this alliance who are challenging the policy of the government
 is par dramuk netaa tii
 r Balu retorted and asked Sinha to name such people
 is par bhaajapa netaa ne sirf itani tippanee kii ki jitna acchhee tarah main jaanata hum, utana hi aap bhi jaanate hai
 When the Lok Sabha meeting resumed at one o'clock in the afternoon, the Congress members demanded that Sinha should apologize for his remarks
 iske turant baad vipakshi sadsy khadey hokar naksalwad ke mudde par congress par palatwaar karne lage
 Sinha had alleged that the Congress had tied up with the Naxalites in Andhra Pradesh
 loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar ne sadasyon se shanti banaaye rakhane kaa anurodh kiya
 Meera said that i will watch the recording and if i see anything against the rules, then i will take appropriate action
 jab sattapaksh or vipaksh ke sadasyon kaa hangaamaa band nahin hua to mira ne kaarywahi dopaher do baje tak ke liye sthagit kar di
 After this, Meera called Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal to discuss
 samprag adhyaksh sonia gandhi, sadan ke netaa pranav mukherjee, grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram and other members of the Congress were seen discussing the issue so that the Home Minister could give his statement freely on the incident of Naxalite attack in Dantewada
 is bich, sinha ko yah kehete suna gaya ki unhone ab tak to sanyam bartaa he or agar unhen majaboor kiya gaya to vah har congress sadsy se niptenge
 As part of the Mission 2019, the BJP is busy fixing its nail pricks
 isi kadi main bijepi alaakaman ne desh ke sabase bade siyaasi soobe uttar pradesh main party kii kaman dow mahendra nath pandeya ko di he
 There are five reasons why party chief Amit Shah has taken a big step to replace Dr
 Mahendra Nath Pandey as party state president in place of Keshav Maurya
 jabaki pradesh adhyaksh kii daud main kai bade chehre shaamil the
 Despite this, the bet is on Mahendra Pandey's hand
 kor vot par najaramahendra nath pandeya kobijepi adhyaksh banaakar party ne soobe ke savarna matdaaton ko saadhane kii koshish kii he
 About 22 percent of upper caste voters are in the state
 inamen kareeb 12 fisadi brahman matadaata he, jo bijepi kaa kor vot mana jaataa he
 In view of these core voters Mahendra Nath Pandey has been given the command of the party
 itnaa hi nahin modi mantrimandal se istipha dene vaale calraj mishra jo upi ke majboot brahman cheharaa maane jate the, unki jagah bharne ke maddenjar bhi ise dekha ja rahaa he
 Mahendra Nath Pandey, the elected president of the union, was born in Pakhanpur village of Ghazipur, UP
 vah sangh ke agan main paley bade hai
 Students had joined the RSS since their life and used to participate in the Sangh branch
 indira gandhi dwaara lagaae gaye apatkaal ke khilaaf andolan kiya tha or kai maheene unhen jail main rahanaa padaa tha
 Mahendra Nath has also been associated with the Ayodhya Ramjanmabhoomi movement
 saamanjasy baitaane kii koshishrajput samaaj se taalluk yogi adityanath ko upi ke siem banaae jane ke baad se soobe kaa brahman samaaj baichaiyn mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 In many districts, including the DGP, the debate started over the appointment of District Officers and Superintendents of Police of Rajput society
 itnaa hi nahin gorakhpur main brahman netaa harishankar tiwari ke ghar par police ke chhapemari or raibareli main 5 brahmanon kii hatya se brahmanon nen bijepi ke prati naaraazgi bad rahi thi
 Apart from this, many Brahmin ministers are in the Yogi government, but their image as a leader is not in the Brahmin society
 aise main rajput or brahman samaaj ke bich saamanjasy banane main mahendra nath pandeya kitna safal ho paaengemodi-shah ke bharosemandpradhanmantri narendra modi aurabijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke mahendra nath pandeyakaribi maane jate hai
 In view of this, he was made a candidate from Chandauli in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 jabaki tikat milane ke baad bhi pandeya chunaav ladane se hichkicha rahe the, lekin amit shah ke samajhane ke baad unhone parchaa bharaa or jitkar loksabhaa pahunche
 After this, Modi gave him a place in his cabinet and was given the responsibility of Minister of State for Human Resource Development
 sangharkshil or jamini netaamahendra nath pandeya kii chhavi sangharkshil or jamini netaa kii rahi he
 He had entered politics from his student life

 In 1991, he contested assembly elections for the first time on a BJP ticket
 kalyaan singh sarkaar main upi main vah mantri bhi rah chuke hai
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati termed the farmer-police struggle in Bhatta Parsaul village of Greater Noida as a part of the abominable politics of opposition parties and said that the opposition parties are promoting the matter by linking it with land compensation
 mayawati ne yahaan apane awaas par samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki jab vipakshi partiyon ke paas koi mudda nahin bachaa to ve sabhi jhooth or afvaahon kaa sahaara lekar pradesh kii janata ko gumraah kar yahaan kii kanoon vyavastha bigaadane main jute gaye
 a living example of this is the case in Bhatta Parsaul village in Greater Noida on Saturday
 bhatta parsul main buudhvaar raat rahul gandhi ke dharne par baithne ko mahaj ‘dramebaaji’ qaraar dete hue mukhyamantri ne unki giraftaar ko uchit tehraaya or kaha ki koi netaa kitna bhi prabhaavshaalee kyon na ho, agar vah kanoon vyavastha kii sthiti ko bigaadta he to use choda nahin jayega
 You have seen its example
 unhone kaha ki yah ghatana virdohi partiyon kii ghinauni sajeesh ke tahat anjaam di gai he
 Some parties spoiled the law and order situation in Bhatta Parsaul by giving weapons to the chaotic elements under a political conspiracy
 mayawati ne kaha ki in arajak tatwon ne bhatta parsul gaanv main kaam ke silsile main gaye parivahan karmiyon ko bandhak banaaya tha
 After getting this information, when police and administrative officials went to get them released, chaotic elements also attacked them
 aisi sthiti main hamaari sarkaar ne un tatwon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii
 In this, we see a lot of hand of some opposing parties
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki sarkaar dwaara kai baar spashtikaran dene ke baavjood is maamle ko vahaan ke kisaanon kii jameen ke muaavje ke vivaad se jodakar uttar pradesh or desh kii janata ko gumraah kiya ja rahaa he
 Since this political conspiracy has now been exposed, the opposing parties are making false propaganda by linking it with compensation
 unhone kaha ki vipakshi partiyon kaa yah aarope bilkul galat he ki bhatta parsul gaanv kii jameen ko yamuna express
 They have been given to private companies
 vah jameen greater noida athurity plan ke liye di gai he
 It is being promoted unfairly and the government condemns it
 bhatta or parsul gaanvon main kisaan apni adhigrahit kii gai jameen kaa muaavja pehle hi le chuke hai
 The Chief Minister said that he wrote letters to the Central Government several times to enact a uniform land acquisition law in the country, but the Center did not pay attention
 baad main rajya sarkaar ne khud hi ek niti taiyaar kii jiske tahat jameen adhigrahan kaa kaary ho rahaa he
 He said that whatever fight Rahul has to fight, he should fight it in his own house
 mujhe lagata he ki unki apane ghar main nahin chalati isiliye vah baahar apni khiz nikaal rahe hai
 Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Rajesh Bhardwaj, from the Atrauli assembly seat in Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh district, accused the in-charge of Dadav police station for harassment by filing a lawsuit for violating the code of conduct for demoralizing
 bharadwaj ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki gat 27 disambar ko unke parijan dwaara sanchalit ek kalyankari trust dwaara vitaran ke liye mangaye gayi kambal jabt kiye gayi the or yah kehete hue un par aachaar samhita ke ulanghan kaa jhootha maamla darj kar diya ki ve kambal unhone mangaye the
 He claimed that the trust distributes blankets to the poor every winter and that this time too, blankets were called for distribution
 bharadwaj ne aarope lagaaya ki sattarudh bahujan samaaj party ke pratyaashee ke paksh main kaam kar rahe thana prabharee manobal giraane ke liye jaanboojhkar unhen nishaanaa bana rahe hai

 The blot on Sanjay Dutt's daemon over the Mumbai blasts left his dignity suspicious
 ab sanjay dutt ke mustakabil ke saath ye shabd hameshaa ke liye jud gaya he
 Punishment mumbai kii tada adaalat unke aatmasamarpan ke intazaar main thi
 Come to Munna
 sanjay dutt ke sarenderke saath hi jail yatra kaa ek auki charan shuru ho gaya he
 Sanjay Dutt surrendered in the TADA court in the Arms Act case involving 93 blasts
 ab unhen takreeban saadhe teen saal jail main gujaarne honge
 When the morning sun saluted the walls of Sanjay Dutt's house, his meeting hall was filled with light but there was darkness in his heart
 ye unki azaadi kii aakiri subah thi
 Among loved ones
 khaium hui miyaad par munna apane ghar se baahar niklaa
 Like a student who has failed in the examination, whose steps proceed, the heart is left behind
 qadam dagamagaa rahe the lekin dil majboot dikhaanaa tha
 Together there was wife, sister, sister had daughters, cinema's big names
 lekin is bheed main bhi tanaha tha munna
 Standing at his doorway, Munna was watching the fallen building of his fortune
 thodaa-thodaa bhaybheet or thodaa-thodaa bhavuk
 Mahesh Bhatt was together, whispered something in the ear
 pataa nahin kya kaha lekin jail jaataa munna jaadu kii jhappi dene laga
 The journey to court began
 bahan aage baithi, patni saath main
 a convoy of cameras followed
 mumbai kii sadakon par aage badhate munna ko yaadon ke udate hue kabutar peeche khinchate ja rahe the
 The journey was moving forward, the companions were leaving behind
 aage baithi bahan baichaiyn ho rahi thi
 The bridge of communication was broken
 koun kya kahata
 The color of grief is shared, the passion of pain is shared
 munna ne hi chuppi todi
 When Sanjay Dutt's ride stopped near Tada Court, the scene came to an end
 bheed aisi ki sanjay dutt kii samaj main nahin aayaa kahaan se aae itane log
 Tried to get off the car but could not get down
 kam se kam paanch baar
 Mahesh Bhatt appeared
 bollywood kaa diggaj nirdeshak logon ke saamne haath jod rahaa tha kaha jane dijie
 The crowd was unrestrained
 patrkaar, cameraman or samarthak, prashansak
 Next time sister came out
 priya dutt, kaha ab jane dijie
 This cannot be stopped
 chhalchalaai hui ankhen bardaasht na kar sakin bhavukta ke dabaav ko, bah nikali
 Eventually Sanjay Dutt came out
 unhone bhi haath joda
 Thanked the people
 bheed ne rasta banaaya or cinema kaa kalakaar sarakane laga is vishaal kunbe ke bich
 The past of the crime had brought Sanjay Dutt in front of the court, to surrender
 sanjay dutt adaalat main chupchaap jaakar khadey ho gaye
 The judge posed some questions, Sanjay Dutt answered
 ab saadhe teen saal tak jail hi unki zindagi he
 Truth bars became a prison for them

 isse pehle baari suraksha ke bich police helmet pahanaakar do mahilaon ko mandir kii taraf le ja rahi thi
 The protesters were raising slogans and chaos to stop them
 baari virodh ke baad donon mahilaon ko aadhe raste se waapas lautaa diya gaya, mahilaayein mandir ke kareeb pahunch gai thim
 These included a journalist and social worker
 pradarshnkaree mahila patrakaron ko mandir kii ore badhane se roak rahe the
 Police were escorting the two women in tight security wearing helmets
 is bich kai pradarshnakariyon ko hiraasat main bhi liya gaya
 Protesters and police got into an argument during the protest
 aiji srijith ne pradarshnakariyon se kaha ki hamen kanoon vyavastha ko thik rakhana he, main bhi ayappa kaa bhakt hum
 But we have to implement the law

 The Election Commission in its historic decision on Monday handed over SP to Akhilesh
 faisla lene se pehle chunaav ayog puure din is mudde par manthan karata rahaa
 The Election Commission also considered the legal aspects of freezing 'bicycles' before taking a decision
 lekin, cycle ko fries karne main sabase bada kanoonee pench yah tha ki samaajawaadee party main tut nahin hui thi
 Mujhe ummeed hai ki maha-gathbandhan hoga, lekin antim nirnay Akhilesh Yadav lenge: Ramgopal Yadav, sppic
 twitter
 com / xwlvufqiqo — ANI UP (@aninewsup) January 16, 2017 The number of times the election symbol has been frozen so far, the parties were torn apart but the matter was different in the SP
 sapa do faad nahin hui thi balki akhilesh or mulaayam donon group party par apana daawa jataa rahe the
 For the sake of strengthening his claims in SP, while Mulayam was citing the Constitution, Akhilesh was showing the majority of the party
 apane manthan main chunaav ayog ko akhilesh kaa palada zyada baari najar aayaa or usne party ke rashtriya adhyaksh ke taur par akhilesh ke naam par apni muhar laga di
 The Commission was required to take a decision on Monday because the notification of the first phase of voting is to be issued on Tuesday
 pehle din se hi kai log apana nomination karne lagate hai
 The SP was the largest party in the last election and was confused about its mark
 chunaav ayog kaa faisla aane ke baad ab pichley kai dinon se chal rahi kashmakash khatm ho chuki he
 Mulayam and Akhilesh had already made it clear that they would accept the Election Commission's decision and not go to court against it
 mulaayam gut kaa tark-party ke sansthaapak mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha ki ab chunaav chihn koi bhi ho, chunaav vahi pratyaashee ladenge jinke tikat unke dastakhat se jari honge
 Mulayam Singh Yadav claimed that the matter is between his father and son, some people were misled by the son
 unhone ramgopal yadav kaa naam to nahin liya, lekin ishaaron ishaaron main bahut kuch kah diya
 Earlier, Mulayam Singh Yadav had reached the Election Commission along with Amar Singh and Shivpal Yadav
 chunaav ayog main unhone party samvidhan kaa hawala dete hue daawa kiya ki vahi hai samaajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyaksh, akhilesh camp ke daavon main koi dam nahin he
 - Mulayam told the Election Commission that according to the constitution of the party, the national president cannot be removed at the national convention
 rashtriya adhiveshan bulaane ke liye kam se kam 30 din pehle notice dena anivaary he, jiskaa paalan nahin kiya gaya
 -mulayam faction said that there is a process to elect a national president, which was not followed
 ramgopal yadav ko pehle se hi unke pad se hataa diya gaya tha
 So they cannot bring any resolution
 unke party se judane kaa elaan sirf twitor ke jariye hi hua tha, jo ki maanya nahin ho saktaa
 Most importantly, no proposal was brought to remove Mulayam Singh Yadav in the session
 lihaaja nayaa rashtriya adhyaksh chunane kaa auchity hi nahin paidaa hota
 The Election Commission should get physical verification of the Akhilesh camp whose support is claiming
 kya daawa he akhilesh gut kaa?-udhar akhilesh yadav ke samarthak ramgopal yadav kii aguwai menchunaav ayogpahunche to chunaav ayog se chunaav kii tareekhen paas aane kii baat rakhte hue is maamle main jald faisla lene kii apil kii
 However, when Ram Gopal Yadav was asked to react to Netaji's statement that he misled Akhilesh, he was enraged
 -chunaav ayog ne akhilesh camp ke logon ko nirdesh die ki party ke vidhayakon kii jo suchi ayog main wo de rahe hai, unki copy duusare paksh yani mulaayam singh yadav ko di jaae
 On behalf of the Akhilesh camp, papers were sent to Netaji at his Delhi and Lucknow offices, but no one anywhere accepted these papers
 -akhilesh gut ne baqayda lakhanu main meeting kii or vidhayakon, emelsi se halafnaamein par dastakhat karaae gaye ki kinake saath hai
 Ramgopal then claimed that 212 mlas, 68 mlcs and 15 mps were in his court
 ramgopal ne kaha ki jahaan akhilesh hai vahiin asli samaajawaadee party he
 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has said that its party has aligned with the Apna Dal led by Krishna Patel and the two parties will together contest all 80 seats

 Aam Aadmi Party's Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said that the seats and their candidates will be decided by the end of February
 singh ne kaha ki party yaa kejariwal ne kabhi nahin kaha ki vah loksabhaa chunaav ladane ja rahe hai
 He is the Chief Minister of Delhi and has no plans to enter the 2019 Lok Sabha election race
 unhone kaha ki party uttar pradesh main un sansadeey kshetron main apane ummidavaar utaaregi jahaan uskaa sanghathan majboot he
 Seats and candidates will be decided by the end of February

 Jitan Ram Manjhi, who was made the Chief Minister of Bihar as a temporary arrangement, was in the news due to his controversial statements made in recent days
 unki is bayaanbaji ko unki khaas ranneeti or raajnneetik mahatvakanksha ke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 Even Chief Minister Manjhi had to face criticism in his own party due to his disputed statements, but Manjhi continued his work irrespective of any criticism
 nitish kumaar ne satta par apni pakad banaae rakhane ke uddeshy se apane vishwast maanjhi ko mukhyamantri pad saunpa, lekin maanjhi apane bayanon ke kaaran ulte kai baar nitish ke liye hi musiibat banate najar aae
 Even the mlas supporting Nitish have even demanded Manjhi's resignation from the party leadership on several occasions
 mokama ke vidhayak anant singh ne maanjhi dwaara savarnon ko videshi kehane vaale bayaan par shuukravaar ko kaha, maanjhi ko avilamb mukhyamantri pad se hataaya janaa chahie
 He is spoiling social harmony
 mukhyamantri maanjhi kii maansik sthiti bighad chuki he
 State Education Minister and senior JDU leader Vrishin Patel also expressed unhappiness with Manjhi's statements, saying such statements are not only making the party gritty, but also making JDU voters unhappy
 haalanki apane bayanon ke kaaran apane hi dal main aalochana ke shikaar maanjhi ke paksh main jediu ke kai vidhayak khadey najar aate hai
 On the other hand, Manjhi's statements are also being seen as part of a well thought out strategy and vote bank
 patna ke varisht patrkaar gyaneshwar kehete hai, maanjhi kaa vivaadaaspad bayaan vot bank kii raajnneeti ke alaava kuch bhi nahin
 As soon as the leadership of JDU realizes the exit of the upper caste vote bank, they are pursuing a strategy to bring the Dalit and backward classes together
 maanjhi ko mukhyamantri banane kii peeche kii ranneeti bhi dalit or pichde virgon ko saath laana hi tha
 Dnyaneshwar believes that Manjhi's statement is being given keeping the equation of Dalit votes completely in mind
 bihar ke laghu sinchai mantri manoj kushvaha ne haalanki maanjhi kaa bachaav karte hue kaha, mukhyamantri maanjhi kuch bhi galat nahin bol rahe hai
 He is just telling his story
 kuch log unke bayanon ko tod-marodakar pesh kar rahe hai
 JDU MLA Arun Manjhi is describing the statements of Chief Minister Manjhi as a mass-raising statement
 arun kehete hai, mukhyamantri ke bayanon se party ko nuksaan nahin ho rahaa he, balki janaadhar bad rahaa he
 Dalits are happy with their statements
 mukhyamantri aaj daliton kii aawaaj banakar ubhare hai
 Meanwhile, Manjhi also made contradictory statements several times
 mukhyamantri ne apane grih jila gaya main yojit ek samaaroh main kah diya ki nitish ke rajya main bhale vikaas hua ho, parantu bhrashtachar tab bhi kam nahin hua tha
 The implications of these statements of Manjhi, who created a political stir in Bihar, began to be removed from the distance of Manjhi and Nitish
 baad main haalanki maanjhi ne nitish se kisi tarah ke vivaad se inkaar kiya
 Politicians believe that Manjhi's statements need to be understood in two to three meanings
 vaise maanjhi raajnneeti main koi nae khilaadi nahin hai ki unhen bayanon ke baad padane vaale prabhaavon kaa anumaan na ho
 However, many experts also say that Manjhi's statements reflect his political ambition
 bihar ke varisht patrkaar or raajnneeti ke jaankaar surendra kishor kehete hai, maanjhi ke bayanon ko do-teen tareekon se samajhnaa hoga
 Manjhi sometimes considers Nitish adorable, sometimes his statements indicate the distance between him and Nitish
 kai bayaan aise bhi aae hai jisase aisa lagata he ki nitish ko kamjor karne ke liye hi bayaan die gaye hai
 Kishore further said, Manjhi had never reached such a high position, so Manjhi chose the path of such statements to make her presence and strength felt
 doosraa yah he ki maanjhi ke peeche kuch adrishy log ho sakate hai, jo aise bayaan dilava rahe hon jiskaa ve sahi vakt par iskaa phayda uthaa saken
 Nandkishore Yadav, senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Leader of Opposition in the Bihar Legislative Assembly, has alleged that Manjhi is making such statements only at the behest of former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 yadav kaa kahana he, nitish ne hi maanjhi ko mukhyamantri banaaya he
 Until the party's national president Sharad Yadav has advised Manjhi to exercise restraint in the matter of statements, but Nitish is silently supporting him
 maanjhi ke bayanon par nitish or rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ke adhyaksh lalu prasad kii chuppi bhi ek khaas ranneeti kaa hissaa ho sakati he
 However, after explaining to the leadership of the party, Manjhi's statement may have been stopped for a few days, but the experts of Bihar politics have started calling him 'bayanveer'
 vaise, bhavishya main maanjhi ke bayaan jediu ke liye phydemand sabit hota he yaa nuksaandeh, yah to aane vaala vakt hi batayega

 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the overwhelming victory of the BJP under the leadership of Narendra Modi and the way the Congress was reduced to 44 seats, then the clear message in the opposition parties was that defeating the BJP is not a matter of any single party
 yaheen se mahagathbandhan shabd astitv main aayaa jisaki pehali pariksha bihar main hui or argedy-jediu gathbandhan ne vidhansabha chunaav main jeet hasil kar ise paas bhi kar liya
 Before the assembly elections in UP, there were some attempts of the grand alliance but she could not climb
 haalanki 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ko mili baari bahumat ne sapa-basapa jaise dalon ko ek saath aane par majaboor kar diya
 The experiment of this alliance was successful in phulpur-gorakhpur and Kairana by-elections and now SP-BSP and RLD have come together against BJP
 congress mahagathbandhan se baahar he
 The survey of Aaj Tak and Karvy Insights shows that the mood of the nation means that SP-BSP-RLD alliance can win 58 out of 80 seats in UP and bjp-apna Dal which won 73 seats in the last election is limited to 18 seats
 Can do
 lekin agar mayawati or akhilesh yadav apane gathbandhan main areldi ke saath-saath congress ko bhi shaamil kar len to upi bijepi ke liye waterlu sabit ho jayega
 The survey was conducted between December 28 and January 8 among 2,478 people in 20 Lok Sabha constituencies of Uttar Pradesh
 ji haa, survey ke nattejey bataate hai ki bijepi kaa vot share 2014 ke 43
 From 3 per cent will be reduced to 36 per cent but the seats it gets will be reduced to just 5 seats instead of 73
 baaki kii 75 siten bispi, espi, areldi or congress ke khate main chali jaaengi
 It can be said clearly that if the grand alliance is formed against the BJP in BJP, then the bjp's sweep will be clear
 2014 main bijepi kii ore se narendra modi ko centre kii satta tak pahunchane main upi se mili 73 (71+2) siton kaa ahm yogadan tha
 But the survey results show that if the Grand Alliance is formed in UP, then Modi's victory chariot at the Center can also be stopped
 gauratlab he ki ajtak kaa karvi incits ke saath ye survey 28 disambar se 8 janvari ke bich kiya gaya
 Data of 20 Lok Sabha constituencies were taken in it and opinions of about two and a half thousand people were taken
 survey ke nattejey bijepi ko liye bada jhatka or mahagathbandhan ke liye khushkhabari kii bhavishyavaanee kar rahe hai

 sochiye agar ipel ke match naa ho to kya ho
 Think as much as you can
 kya hoga zyada se zyada? yahi ki shaam kaise kategi, shaam ko ghar jaakar kya karegein, shaam kii chaay par gocip kya hogi, shaam ko doston ke bich baithkar cricket ke bare main dinge kaise haakenge, shaam kii bear kis bahaane se peeyenge, shaam ko so called relexeshan kaise ho paayegaa, thakaan kaise utregi
 And if the people put small conditions in the name of cricket and earn some money then how will they be able to earn it
 bas yahi sab naa
 More than that, it makes a difference even if there is no reason
 kyonki itani si chiz paane ke liye jo keemat aap or aapkaa desh chukaa rahaa he uske bare main sochna bhi hamaara hi kaam he
 This country belongs to us and we are not from it
 bharat jaise garib desh ko ipel se kya phayda ho rahaa he? kya hamaare yahaan naukariyaan paidaa ho rahi hai? kya hamaari arthvyavastha sanvar rahi he? kya hamaare gharon main istemaal hone vaali rosemara kii chijen sasti ho rahi he
 Are our children developing mentally
 kya ye garibi rekha se neeche rahane waalon kaa jeevanaster acha ho rahaa he
 Is the production of roads, water and electricity increasing in the country
 kya hamaare mehanatakash kisaan or majdoor ko do vakt kii swabhimani roti mil paa rahi he
 Is the number of people living below the poverty line coming down? kya desh main padosi mulkon se aane vaala khatra kam ho rahaa he
 There is no time left to regret the indecency of the game of Bhadra Lok by thinking about it
 indian paisa lig, indian paap lig, indian panter lig, indian paapi lig, ye sab kathith naam sunakar karondon cricket ke diwaanon kaa khun khaulane lagata he
 Time has come to think of how a handful of people are using cricket wrongly for their profit and to end this big bang
 kuch chand log ipel ke naam par karodon-arabon ke vaare nyaare kar rahe hai
 No hard work, no thinking, no planning
 bas apni khaufnak soch se mehanatakash logon kaa khun kaise chusaa jaye
 How to make owls by showing them dreams of palaces
 bagaiyr kisi mehnat ke ye cricket ke dushman gentlemen’s game kii patalun utaarne main kasar nahin chod rahe
 The stain on the white dress is easily visible
 tabhi in chaalaak chandalon ne cricket kii poshaak tak badal daali
 The game played in the light of day has now become a nightmare for the blinds
 ye sab in luteron ne apni jeben garm karne ke liye kiya he naa ki kisi kii bhalaai ke liye
 Excuses were taken that it was good for new and emerging players
 unhen antarrashtriya khiladiyon ke saath khilne or seekhney kaa mauka milegaa
 But this argument is not embraced whether India did not produce players like Mushtaq Ali, Gavaskar, Vishwanath, Kapil Dev, Sachin Tedulkar first
 ye bataaiye jaraa ki kris gail jab west indies ke khelengen to kya wo aise chakke nahin uda paayengen
 Does Dhoni's Midas touch not work for India? kya ponting bharat ke ubharate huye khiladiyon ko sachin se zyada acchhee sikh de paayengen
 In the IPL, from team honorship to team management and now all the players are responsible for taking cricket into the trough
 board kaa adhyaksh ipel kii ek team kaa maalik he
 There are many teams, whose owners are unknown
 ek team aisi he jo apane hi duusare kaarobaar se jude logo kii naukariyaan chin rahaa he or yahaan par paise nichod rahaa he
 It is clear that who is involved in this racket from top to bottom is very difficult to find
 kyonki in dhaandhlebaajon ke sambandh netaaon se lekar anderworld tak hai or sab milakar aam aadmi kaa pasinaa chuse le rahe hai
 When the role of the underworld is gradually becoming clear, then it is clear that it is not going to benefit the country
 sirf anderworld barbaad kar rahaa he
 The economy is being hollowed out, cricket is being maligned
 cricket ke liye bhala hoga ki club level ke naam par khelaa ja rahaa ipel band kar diya jaye
 And they should be between 20-20 countries
 jab do desh aapas main bhidate hai to bhaavnaayen alag hoti hai, junun alag hota he, romaanch or mazaa alag hota he
 That same madness can increase the number of cricket addicts
 nahin to ab cricket ko dekhne keval dhandhebaaj aayengen jo sirf ise nichodengen or chus chus kar barbaad kar denge
 And if it is compulsory / necessary to keep the IPL running, betting should be legalized ie betting
 yani sab milakar khule main satta khelen
 So that the government treasury will also benefit from betting, because when there is official betting, then the earnings made from it will also be taxed
 kam se kam ye chor lutere desh ko khokhla nahin kar paayengen
 Also betting is ALLOW but no match fixing or spot fixing
 or tab jo bhi ye phixing kare use kam se kam aaajeevan karawas ho or use kam se kam 20 saal tak naa to zamaanat mili or hi parole mili
 Just as the entire nation was demanding to be hanged in the rape case, in this case, there is a need to mobilize so that the people who looted the poor and middle class people with the dream of making them rich will be encouraged and cricket Instead of being disgusted and hated by the lovers of the world, this love rose day and night

 Many people find it very difficult to wash dishes

 If you are not able to wash immediately while working and you are not getting any help, then you can make this work easy by taking care of some things
 saare bartan ek saath jamaa kar lembertan dhone se pehle puure ghar ko check kar len or saare juthe bartanon ko ek hi jagah ikattha kar len
 You will not have to run again if you work from planning

 Soak the utensils first in water
 Soak the utensils in warm water before rinsing them so that they are left smooth and do not need much effort to clean them
 bartanon ko dhone se pehlejuthe bartanon ko pani se saaf karke kisi alag tub yaa slab par hi rakh len
 By doing this, your work will also be reduced and you will not have to remove the garbage from the pots again and again
 bartanon ko scrub karne ke baad unhen chote se lekar bade ke kramme dhonaa shuru karen
 Clean the light utensils and crockery first, wash the glass utensils and ceramic utensils separately and keep them separate so that the risk of their breakage is reduced
 chammach, kaante or chaaku bhi pehle hi saaf kar len
 After washing the utensils, do not put the utensils together after washing them
 pehle inhen sookhne den or phir kichan towel se ponchney ke baad rack main rakhen

 swaraj ne twitor par kaha ,‘‘ ham liver pratiropan surgery ke liye aapke pita ko vija de rahe hai
 '' (input bhashaa se) Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav has strongly attacked Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi
 tejasvi yadav ne apane aadhikarik twitor acount par do twit kiye, jisamen pehle to nitish kumaar ko 'afvaah mahashay' se sambodhit kiya or phir bihar ko garib rajya bataane ke liye nitish sarkaar dwaara khud kii vifaltaa sweekaar karne kii baat kahi
 At the same time, Tejashwi has described Sushil Modi as the 'greatest sophist master'
 unhone susheel modi par tanj ksaa kiinke betuke kutarkon kaa bhavarth he ki yuva ghabaraae nahin agle 30 varsh main naukari mil jaaegi
 Tejashwi Yadav, while targeting Nitish Kumar in his first tweet, wrote, "even after ruling for 15 years, the rumor monger is saying that Bihar is a poor state
 nitish sarkaar swayan vifaltaaen sweekaar kar apni prachand naakaami kii apni hi zubaani gavaahi de rahi he
 In Bihar, people are not getting no-bread and they are telling the stories of eating biscuits and cakes on TV
 ''iske baad agle twit main tejasvi ne likhaa, ''bihar ke sabase bade kutark master susheel modi kabhi kehete he sawan-bhado kii vajah se mandi he
 Sometimes it is said that the father-side, sometimes the Kharmas, sometimes the flood-drought and sometimes the law-system is a recession due to natural disaster

 '' mobile or computer main aap headphone jarur yuj karte hi honge or shaayad aapako is baat kaa andaja bhi na ho ki ye bhi hack ho sakate hai
 Just like a webcam or Facebook account are hacked
 vird kii ek report ke mutabik israeli researchron ke ek group ne headphone hekking kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Understand this in simple terms
 kisi mailaware ke jariye pehle aapke headphone ko microphone main badal diya jaataa he or phir iske jariye aapaki baatcheet record hoti rahati he
 Researchers at Ben Gurion University of Israel have prepared a proof of concept
 isamen yah bataaya gaya he ki kaise havers aapke audio ko record karne ke liye yaa aapakibaatcheet ko sunne ke liye headphonko hijac kar sakate hai
 The most surprising thing in this is that the hackers can listen to your conversation even when your headphone is not connected to the computer and disabled
 maileware ke jariye yearbad main lage spikar ko microphone main canwart kar diya jaataa he jisase aap paas ke audio havers ke paas ja sakate hai
 This can cover the conversation being done in an entire room more or less
 year bads ko microphone ke taur paraap bhi yuj kar sakate hai ye zyada mushkilanhin he
 Researchers hacked the first computer's audio codec chipset Realtek Audio for headphone hacking
 ek baar audio chip hack ho gaya phir input or output ko switch kar diya jaataa he or is vajah se headphone input divaais ke taur par kaam karne lagata he
 That is, if you have an inbuilt microphone in your headphones then the work of hackers will become easy
 lekin agar microphone nahin bhi he to agar wo chahen to use apane control main le sakate hai
