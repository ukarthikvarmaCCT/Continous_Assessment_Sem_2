 He tweeted that two boat riders are stuck in difficulty and no one asks the monkey who has been separated from the herd
 ravivaar subah ko hi yah saaf ho gaya tha ki modi mantrimandal main nitish kumaar kii party jediu shaamil nahin hogi
 It is said that the JDU cabinet is not happy with the bjp's stand on expansion
 bijepi kii taraf se yah khabar aa rahi thi ki jediu ek cabinet mantri or ek rajyamantri ke prastaav par maan gai he
 But the tussle between BJP and JDU continued till Saturday afternoon over the number of ministers and the portfolio
 narendra modi or amit shah kii uljhan ye thi ki shivasena ke paas loksabhaa ke saansad jediu ke mukaable zyada hai
 And Anant Geete, the sole member of the party in the Union Cabinet, is the Heavy Industries Minister
 aise main jediu ko do mantri dena shivasena ko naaraaz kar saktaa tha
 According to sources, he was not satisfied with the offer made by BJP to Nitish Kumar
 iske baad to lalu prasad yadav ko jaise nitish kumaar par hamale kaa mauka mil gaya
 Recently, the entire Yadav family is very angry due to Nitish switching sides with the BJP, in which case he does not leave any chance of attacking Nitish

 massej clear he bos— Tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi)september 3, 2017 Chief Election Commissioner SY Qureshi on Sunday said that the right to recall mps who did not do good work cannot be effective in a big country like India
 unki pratikriya pradhanmantri manmohan singh dwaara anna hajaare ko is aashay kaa patr likhane ke baad ai he ki sarkaar chunaav sudhaaron ke liye kadam uthaaegi
 Qureshi said, "our main fear is that if we start rejecting all the candidates, we will have to go for re-election while the people are already burdened with the expenses incurred in the elections
" " janpratinidhiyon ko waapas bulaane kaa adhikaar, jo bahut se viksit deshon main he, kaa virodh karte hue unhone kaha ki isse desh main 'asthirataa' aegi, khaskar un kshetron main jo pehle se hi alag-thalag pade hai
 Regarding the right to reject the candidates, Qureshi said that although the Election Commission has supported the inclusion of 49-O button in the EVM to express dissatisfaction with the voters, the proposal would often lead to election
 niyamanusaar, matadaata yadi matdaan nahin karne kaa faisla letaa he to vah 49-o kaa chayan kar saktaa he
 Anna Hazare has supported this saying that if the candidates who spend crores of rupees in the election are rejected, they will be discouraged

 It's been a month since i witnessed the most peaceful evening
 It's been a month since i realized once again that i love sunsets more, and it's been a month since i understood that a trip gives us an opportunity to know a known person in a better way
 And each day, i spent few minutes to see the pictures, again and again
 Each day, i closed my eyes and saw a glimpse of that beautiful evening, Each day, i took a deep breath to remember the mesmerizing boat ride, And each day, i reminded myself to keep calm and smilingly overcome the inner struggles, because there are many more sunsets to watch
 🙂❤

 Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, while speaking on the bjp's 'main Bhi Chowkidar' campaign, said that he is a Shiv Sainik, not a watchman
 shivasena ke varisht netaa sanjay raut ke saath hue ek intervyuu main uddhav thakare ne yah bhi kaha ki ve congress mukt bharat ke samarthak nahin hai
 It is worth noting that in every election rally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi talks about Congress-mukt Bharat and there are a lot of attackers on Congress

 People are surprised after this statement by Shiv Sena chief

 Saamana is the main paper of his own party
 uddhav thakare ne ab tak kisi ko bhi koi intervyuu haal ke dinon main nahin diya he
 Uddhav Thackeray is aware that if he gives interviews to the media, he may face very tough questions
 shivasena or bijepi kaa yah gathbandhan aasaan nahin tha
 Amit Shah had to take initiative for this alliance
 isse pehle shivasena ne elaan kiya tha ki maharashtra kii sabhi siton par vah akele chunaav ladegi
 However, before the elections, the matter was largely settled between the BJP and the Congress
 iske baad jo press conference hua usamen main bhi uddhav thakare ne media ke sawaalon kaa koi jawaab nahin diya tha
 Even after this, Shiv Sena remained a raid against the bjp's policies for a few days

 All the people living in India standing at the strange crossroads of law and logic have suddenly faced the challenge of proving their citizenship
 aisi sthiti pehle kabhi nahin thi, aazaadee, bantwaare, riyasaton ke vilay or samvidhan ke nirmaan ke samay bhi aisi sthiti nahin thi
 At the time of the creation of the country, every person living or born in India or whose parents were born here or who had been residing in India for at least five years before the Constitution came into force, was an Indian citizen
 itihaas ke us mode par hamaari sarajameen or janata, donon ko apni nai pahchaan banani thi
 The Constituent Assembly left the decision on the determination of citizenship to Parliament which was then taking shape
 pehla aam chunaav, naagarikta adhinium, 1955 lagu hone ke teen saal pehle 1952 main hua tha
 Legally those people were considered to be of 'indian origin' or whose parents or grandparents were born in undivided India

 a new argument with respect to illegal migrants came to light in 2003 when the Citizenship Act was amended to make some fundamental changes in views relating to citizenship and their place of residence
 is sanshodhan ke pehle niyam yah tha ki agar kisi bachche ke mata-pita bhartiya the, to bachche ko khud-ba-khud bhartiya naagarikta mil jaati thi
 The 2003 amendment stipulated that now a child would automatically receive "citizenship" after birth if the parent was not an "illegal migrant" at the time of birth
 hairaani ki is sanshodhan main 'videshi naagarik' ko vishesh darja diya gaya he jinke vanshaj samvidhan lagu hone ke samay bharat ke naagarik ban sakate the, par unhone kisi duusare desh kii naagarikta chun lee thi
 However, this facility is not extended to citizens of Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) or Pakistan
 2003 ke sanshodhan main neshnal register of citigens (enarasi) taiyaar karne kaa praavdhaan bhi pesh kiya gaya
 As a first step of the NRC, the National Population Register was proposed, which market makers of e-governance immediately adopted as a mission mode project and created a clever political game in the name of technology and administration that would challenge the idea of indian citizenship
 At the same time, Citizen was making data a benefit
 is baat se bhi koi ho-hallaa nahin machaa, kyonki sandigdh logon kii pahchaan ke sambandh main poochtacha ek sahaj prakriya maani jaati he, par koi kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa tha ki kisi din ek puri aabaadi ke saamne apni naagarikta sabit karne kii chunauti khadi ho jaaegi
 Since the NRC started in Assam in 2013, and the Supreme Court mentioned words like floods, illegal migrants and 'people from outside', the situation took a new turn
 pichley chah varshon main assam main harek vyakti ko dastavejon-viraasati dastavejon (jaise bhoomi record, adaalat ke maamle, janm pramaan patr, skool yaa vishvavidhyalay ke pramaan patr) or vanshavali dastavejon ke jariye apni naagarikta sabit kerani pad rahi he
 (evidence of relationship with his ancestors who had been citizens of India)
 mahilaon, jo shaadi ke baad kisi or jagah chali gayi or garib tabake ko apni pahchaan sabit karne main baari mashkkat kerani pad rahi he
 Mismatched facts and mistakes in the documents have created havoc
 sarkari register jis par dastavejon kaa satyaapan nirbhar karata he, unhen sambhaal kar rakhana ek bada kaam he, kyonki unhen samay ke lambey antaraal hi nahin, balki aag or baadh jaisi aapadaaon ko bhi jhelana padataa he
 The process is currently controlled by the Supreme Court

 bijepi ko 18 or congress ko do siten mili hai
 Mukul Roy and Bengal BJP in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya have a big role in this victory of BJP
 is chunaav main bijepi ke liye jabardast nattejey pashchim bengal se aae jahaan usne mamata banerjee kii trinmul congress ke paseene chhudaa die
 For eight years, the ruling Trinamool saw the biggest upset by the BJP led by Amit Shah
 abhi haal main trinmul congress ne vidhayak subhranshu roy ko chah saal ke liye party se nilambit kar diya tha
 Subhranshu is the son of Mukul Roy, once close to Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee
 subhranshu ko party kii image kharaab karne ke aarope main nilambit kiya gaya
 Long before the Lok Sabha elections, Mukul Roy left the Trinamool Congress and joined the BJP
 trinmul main foot ke liye party ke andar anushaasan kii kami or netaaon kii baat na suna janaa bhi kaaran mana ja rahaa he
 People like Arjun Singh who joined BJP and have now become mps, ever wanted to become MP but Trinamool did not consider his name, so he left the party
 aise hi or log bhi hai jo trinmul main apane ko fansaa hua mahasoos kar rahe hai or party chhod rahe hai
 Mukul Roy has been known to join leaders of other parties in the Trinamool for many years, but he is now in the BJP and engaged in the task of breaking the Trinamool
 bijepi main shaamil hone ke baad bhi unhone yahi dakshata dikhaai or kai anya netaaon-kaaryakartaaon ke saath vartmaan trinmul saansadon anupam haajra or saumitr khan ko bijepi main shaamil kiya
 He also broke some leaders of the Left parties in favor of the BJP

 Important Dates: Last Date for Submission of Application: 13 February 2015 GD and Personal Interview: 16 March 2015 team india ke up captain viraat kohli ko ekabhartiya patrkaar ko gaaliyaan dene kii vajahase bisisiai kii jhaad padi he
 The BCCI has warned Virat Kohli in a case of misbehavior with a journalist in Perth
 bisisiai ne kaha he ki perth main hui ghatana doharaai nahin jaani chahie or khilaadiyon ko maryaada kaa khyaal rakhana chahie
 Virat Kohli was accused of misconduct with a journalist in Perth
 khabar yah bhi he ki hindustan times akhbaar ne kohli ke khilaaf apana cese waapas le liya he, jiske patrkaar ke saath unhone badasluki kii thi
 The journalist had complained about Kohli's misbehavior to both the ICC and the BCCI
 lekin ab cese waapas lene ke baad yah vivaad shant hone kii ummid he
 Let me tell you that Virat Kohli was angry with a news related to him and Anushka, due to which he abused the journalist
 haalanki unhone kuch der baad maafee bhi maangi thi, lekin patrkaar ne puri ghatana ko ek artical ke jariye sabake saamne rakhaa
 The journalist said that Kohli gave many abuses
 itnaa hi nahin viraat kareeb 15 minute tak uski taraf ishaara karte hue gaali dete rahe
 In this case, the team manager may have said that Virat had not abused and the case is over, but the way the journalist has narrated the events it is clear that Virat had lost his temper and from his tongue The abuses were raining like they are now scoring runs with their bats
 yah he vaakyagauratlab he ki perth main mangalvaar ko kohli abhyaas ke baad jab dressing room kii taraf laut rahe the to unhone apane saamne ek rashtriya dainik ke patrkaar ko khadaa paaya
 Kohli started abusing before the journalist could understand anything
 lagbhag aadhe ghante tak aisa chalata rahaa or bhartiya team ke kuch sadsy bhi tab hairaani se dekh rahe the ki aakhir maajaraa kya he
 Even that journalist did not know why Kohli is behaving like this, but when Kohli's anger subsided, he told someone that a report about him and Anushka Sharma was published in the national daily and he felt that this report That journalist had written
 jab kohli ko bataaya gaya ki usne patrkaar kii sahi pahchaan nahin kii, to kohli ne ek patrkaar ko bulaayaa or uske jariye ghatana ke liye maafee maangi
 Raj Kapoor, the first show man of Indian cinema, was a great progressive filmmaker with a wonderful ability to make the audience think through the screen of life in a three-hour show
 bhartiya cinema ko kai kaaljayi filmein dene vaale is filmkaar ne darshakon ko hansaaya rulaayaa or unhen apane hi ird gird kii dhaki chuphi sachchaaiyon or dil main dabi bhaawanaaon se ru-ba-ru karaayaa

 These films have the advantage of being the masterpiece of Indian cinema
 rajkpur kii ek anya mahaan filmkaar gurudutt se tulana kii jaati he lekin buniyadi soch ke lihaaj se vah gurudutt se alag the
 Producer director Subhash Ghai, called the second show man of Indian cinema, said that Raj Kapoor's rebellion as a filmmaker was not as hopeful as that of Gurudutt
 ghai ne kaha ki rajkpur ek aise vichaarak filmkaar the jinaki soch main duniya kii tamaam oonch neech ke baavjood usase jude rahane kii ichha saaf najar aati thi
 He said that Raj Kapoor was a show man in the true sense
 aaj vah hamaare bich bhale hi maujuud na hon lekin apni filmon ke rup main vah hamaare bich hameshaa rahenge
 Raj Kapoor's thinking has come out in front of the world in the form of his films
 film jis desh main ganga bahati he unki shantivaadee rumaniyat ke vidrohi rup main tabdili kii kahani he vahiin mukhya rup se aawaara, shri 420 or sangam insaan ke jameer ke pahaluon ko tatolti hai
 Raj Kapoor gave special preference to women in his films

 Raj Kapoor implemented the philosophy of the audience
 unhone ek baar kaha tha ki hamaare log bade meharbaan hai, wo cinema jane ke liye har mushkil sehate hai, ek adad tikat ke liye lambi lambi kataron main khadey hokar apni baari kaa intjaar karte hai
 Whether it is to move, be hard sun or rain heavily

 Swaraj Abhiyan, an organization of Yogendra Yadav, questioned the drought figures in 11 states in the Supreme Court by the Central Government
 mangalvaar ko sunwaayee ke dauraan yachikakarta swaraj abhiyaan kii taraf se prashanth bhushan ne court ko bataaya ki sarkaar ne sookhe se prabhavit logon ke jo aankade bataae hai, asal main usase zyada log sookhe se prabhavit hamprashanth bhushnake mutabik, 'sookhaa prabhavit rajyon main 40 se 45 fisadi log sookhe se prabhavit hai

 ' sarkaar ne pichhali baar sunwaayee main court ko bataaya tha kii 10 rajyon ke 256 jilon main kareeb 33 karod log sookhe se prabhavit hai
 What are the government figures? Bhushan said, “according to government statistics, 15 districts of Bihar are partially affected by drought
 gujarat ke 15 jile sookhe se aanshik rup se or 3 jile thode prabhavit hai
 While 8 districts and 4 districts of Haryana are slightly affected

 In season 11 of Kaun Banega Crorepati, 19-year-old contestant Himanshu Dhuria missed out on winning an amount of one crore
 unhone shandaar tareeke se game khelaa or 14 sawaalon kaa sahi jawaab diya lekin ek karod ke sawaal par ve thodaa duvidha main aa gaye
 His lifeline was also over, so he thought it better to leave the game without taking the risk, however, when Amitabh Bachchan asked him to answer the question, he also gave the right answer to this question but since Himanshu had left the game , Except in such mixed feelings of regret and joy, they could not do anything
 gauratlab he ki kebisi ke ab tak ke sho main sirf ek femail contestant hi ek karod ke sawaal tak pahunchi thi or sawaal kaa jawaab pataa nahin hone kii vajah se unhone game quit karnaa behatar samajha tha
 Himanshu's journey in Kaun Banega Crorepati was very interesting
 uttar pradesh ke rahane vaale himanshu ko kebisi main somvaar ko hot seat par aane kaa mauka mila
 Himanshu is studying in the flying institute of government
 unki training chal rahi he
 Later, Himanshu wants to become a pilot
 gauratlab he ki himanshu dhuria ne 2
 In 42 seconds, he also set a new record by answering Fastest Finger First, although he was quite nervous on his first question and he had already used Lifeline on the question
 unka sawaal tha ki asambhav baaten sochane vaale ke liye prayog kiye jane vaale hindi muhaavarey ko puraa kariye, khyaali__pakaana
 The correct answer is casserole
 lekin himanshu ko iskaa jawaab nahin pataa tha or unhone audiyans pole lifline ke jariye iskaa jawaab diya tha
 However, after this Himanshu performed a brilliant game and won an amount of 50 lakhs
 dilli kii satta kaa rasta uttar pradesh se hokar gujarata he
 In terms of Lok Sabha seats, the echo of the party whose flag is raised in the largest state of the country is heard till Delhi
 yahi vajah he ki narendra modi ke vijay rath ko uttar pradesh main rokane ke liye sapa-basapa-areldi ne gathbandhan kiya he
 At the same time, the BJP is adopting a new strategy to repeat the results like 2014 and to destroy the SP-BSP-RLD equation
 iske tahat bijepi soobe main gathbandhan ke ummidavaar ko target karne ke bajaay congress ke muslim pratyaashiyon ke khilaaf zyada akramak rukh apana rahi he
 The BJP had a major political advantage in the 2017 assembly elections
 congress ne uttar pradesh main abhi tak 9 muslim ummidavaar utaare hai
 Imran Masood from Saharanpur, Nasimuddin Siddiqui from Bijnor, Imran Pratapgadi from Moradabad, Salim Sherwani from Badaun, Zafar Ali Naqvi from Lakhimpur Kheri, Kaiser Jahan from Sitapur, Niyaz Ahmad from Deoria, Santakbirnagar Parvez Khan and Salman Khurshid from Farrukhabad is
 bijepi kii nai ranneetibijapi soobe main jahaan sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko lekar mukhar he
 At the same time, in the seats where Congress has fielded Muslim candidates, the bjp's strategy seems completely changed
 yahaan bijepi ke star prachaarak hon yaa phir party pratyaashee wo gathbandhan se zyada congress ko target kar rahe hai
 It is believed that this is part of the thoughtful strategy of BJP
 bataa den ki saharanpur loksabhaa seat par uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne bijepi ke vijay sankalp sabha ke dauraan kaha tha, 'saharanpur main bhi jaish-e mohammad ke sargana aatanki masood ajahar kaa ek damaad he jo usee kii bhashaa bolta he, isliye aapako tay karnaa he ki aatanki kii bhashaa bolne vaale vyakti ko jitaana he yaa pradhanmantri narendra modi ke senaanee ke rup main kaam kar rahe raghav lakhanpal ko
 Although CM Yogi Adityanath did not directly name anyone, it is believed that his statement was for Congress candidate Imran Masood from Saharanpur
 dilachasp baat ye he ki is seat par yogi ne gathbandhan ke pratyaashee ko lekar koi tippanee nahin kii
 By this, the bjp's strategy can be clearly understood
 congress ko target karne kaa phaaydabijepi kii is ranneeti ko lekar uttar pradesh ke varisht patrkaar kaashi prasad ne ajtak se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki musalamaanon kii badi sankhya gathbandhan ke ummidavaaron ke paksh main khadi najar aa rahi he
 BJP understands this very well
 yahi vajah he ki wo gathbandhan ke bajaae congress ko target karke muslim voton main kanfusion kii sthiti paidaa karnaa chaahati he
 This strategy of BJP may directly benefit the coalition and BJP
 kaashi prasad kehete hai ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan kaa apana majboot votbank he
 The Congress has already strengthened its position, but in the current political situation, the Muslim candidates of the Congress are not winning on their own
 aise main bijepi chaahati he ki agar muslim vot gathbandhan ke bajaae congress kii taraf rukh karegaa to use phayda mil saktaa he
 BJP candidate from Badaun Lok Sabha constituency Sanghamitra Maurya is also saying that she will contest against Congress's Salim Sherwani instead of coalition candidate Dharmendra Yadav
 isi tarah baaki dusron siton par bijepi ke ummidavaar ko dekhen to saaf he ki wo apana muqabla gathbandhan se nahin balki congress se bataa rahe hai
 Mufti Abdul Rajik, who is associated with jamaat-e-ulama-e-hind, says the BJP is targeting Muslim candidates of the Congress under a well thought out strategy
 haalanki unka kahana he ki is baar musalmaan bahut hi khamoshi akhriyaar kiye hue hai, lekin bijepi kii is badali hui ranneeti se muslim voton ke bantna kaa dar bhi sata rahaa he
 Interestingly, the seats where Congress has fielded Muslim candidates
 inamen se ek bhi seat aisi nahin he jo muslim maton ke sahare jiti ja sake
 Although Muslim voters are in large numbers in these seats, but they did not do so much with the support of which they can win the victory
 vahiin, duusari ore dekhen to gathbandhan ke raajnneetik sameekaran ko dekhen to basapa kaa dalit, sapa kaa yadav or areldi ke jat matadaata ke saath-saath muslim voter ek saath aate hai to bijepi ke liye jeet kii raah kaanton bhari najar aati he
 However, the challenge before the coalition is to keep its vote bank united

 Amid all the allegations that the Commonwealth Games were being held, the government on Tuesday wrapped up the NDA rule and clarified that it had only two options to cancel the Commonwealth Games or to move forward with Suresh Kalamadi
 or desh kii izzat kii khatir usne duusare vikalp ko chunaa
 Bursting the NDA rule to make Kalmadi the head of the Organizing Committee for those Games, Sports Minister Ajay Maken said in his own statement in the Lok Sabha today that the NDA government had signed the event for the Commonwealth Games
 jab aise kisi vishay par hastakshar kiya jaataa he to isamen koi raajnneetik party nahin hoti he balki bharat sarkaar hoti he
 However, Maken said in his statement, in the original bid, the Chairman of the Executive Board of the Organizing Committee was made to appoint a government person and the Vice President of the Olympic Association of India (IOA)
 haalanki baad main adhyaksh ke rup main sarkari vyakti ke shabd ko hataa diya gaya
 Kalmadi was the president of the IOA at that time
 sadan main bayaan dene ke baad unhone baahar samvaadadaataaon se kaha, hamaare paas do hi vikalp the, pehla rashtramandal khel ke aayojan ko radd karke desh ko duniya ke saamne sharmida hone dete
 
 doosraa kaalmadi ko saath lekar khel kaa aayojan karte
 We chose the second option
 maakan ne kaha, mejabaan shahar ke anubandh par tatkaaleen bharat sarkaar ke khel sachiv ne hastakshar kiya or rajg sarkaar ke cabinet ne ise manjuuri di jabaki adarsh rup se is par rashtriya rajdhani kshetra ke sarkaar ke sachiv ke hastakshar or iske mantrimandal kii manjuuri honi chahie thi
 Such is the trend in organizing international sports competitions in the world
 aagaamee landan olympic main bhi isi paddati ko apanaaya gaya he
 The sports minister accused the then NDA regime of not properly examining the contract protocol at that time and neither finding nor suggesting any viable alternatives in relation to the provisions
 unhone kaha ki rashtramandal khel parisangh ke saath mejabaan shahar ke kanoonee rup se badhyakaari anubandh par 13 november 2003 ko ioe ke adhyaksh suresh kalmadi, dilli ke leftinent garvanar or yuva evam khel mantri ne hastakshar kiye
 Maken said in his statement that the contract of the host city stated that the organizing committee would have the legal status of organizing the game
 baharhaal, ek november 2004 ko ioe mahasabha ne suresh kalmadi ko rashtramandal khel aayojan samiti kaa adhyaksh chun liya
 This authorized Kalmadi to coordinate with the Government of India and the Government of the National Capital Region
 maakan ne kaha ki tatkaaleen centre sarkaar ko rashtriya rajdhani kshetra dilli kii sarkaar ko anubandh par hastakshar karne ke liye prerit karnaa chahie tha lekin usne swayan pahal karte hue dilli main 2010 rashtramandal khelon ke aayojan ke liye samarthan patr jari kiya or bajtiy sthiti kii chintaa kiye bina rajasav or kharch kii kami ko puraa karne kii baat kahi

 In the film, she is seen in the role of a woman of dark color
 jabaki ayushmaan film main ek bald shaks ke role main dikhe
 The audience is very fond of Bala
 isamen dikhaaya gaya he ki kaise ek kam bal vaale shaks kaa samaaj main majaak udaaya jaataa he
 Also, while talking about personal life, Bhoomi said that in real life he has been bullied for different reasons
 actress ne bataaya ki sabhi ko iskaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 i have been facing all these since the beginning of my career
 bachapan main main moti thi or meraa majaak banaaya jaataa tha
 People have problems with everything
 agar aap zyada chote hai, yaa zyada bade hai, agar aapke bal zyada hai, yaa kam hai, aapaki skin kisi he, in sabhi chizon se logon ko dikkat he
 Further, Bhoomi said that he faced a lot of difficulties in the beginning, not only in personal life but also on the professional front
 bhoomikhati hai ki log unase tarah-tarah ke sawaal karte rahete hai
 People raise questions about the character of my films and recommend not to do the kind of films i do
 filmon main die jane vaale pe scale ke bare main baat karte hue bhoomi kahati hai ki- kariyar ke shuruaati dinon main ye ek badi pareshaani hua karti thi
 i am not comparing my fees to any actor who has been in the industry for a long time
 magar ek samay aisa tha jab mujhe costar kii fees kii tulana main sirf 5 percent fees milti thi
 While the career graph of that actor used to be normal for my career
 ab industry main badal rahe hai halatmgar bhoomi ne is par turant ye bhi kaha ki- aaj chijen jaldi-jaldi badal rahi hai
 There are so many films focused on women in which their role remains impressive
 bataa den ki industry main ek dashak pehle tak ye kivaayad thi ki actor tulana main actress ko kam fees di jaati thi
 But the result of the initiative of actresses like Priyanka Chopra, Deepika Padukone, Kangana Ranaut, Anushka Sharma and Kareena Kapoor is that the actress is getting good fees in the industry today
 deepika padukon khule taur par ye baat kubulati bhi hai ki kuch filmon main unki fees film ke lead actors se zyada hoti he
 The central government is once again preparing to bring a bill to ban triple talaq
 bijepi (BJP) kaa kahana he ki yah mudda uske chunaav ghoshnaa patr kaa hissaa he isliye teen talaak par pabandi kaa bill laayaa jayega
 The government will also look into the report of the Law Commission on this issue
 kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad (ravishankar Prasad) ne somvaar ko kaha ki fori teen talaak (triple Talaq) kii pratha par pabandi lagane ke liye sarkaar sansad main phir se vidheyak laaegi
 With the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha last month, the controversial bill banning the immediate triple talaq expired as it was not passed in Parliament and remained pending in the Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha main pesh kiya gaya or lambit vidheyak loksabhaa ke bhang hone ke saath samaapt nahin hota
 However, the term of the bill passed by Lok Sabha and pending in Rajya Sabha ends
 vipaksh rajyasabha main vidheyak ke praavdhaanon kaa virodh kar rahaa tha, jahaan par sarkaar ke paas ise paarit karaane ke liye paryaapt sankhya nahin thi
 Asked if the bill would be brought back on the Teen Talaq divorce, Prasad said, "absolutely
" fori teen talaak (kaa mudda) hamaare (bijepi) ghoshnaptr kaa hissaa he
 Why not? ”on a question about the Uniform Civil Code, he said that the government will discuss the issue politically
 vah is mudde par vidhi ayog kii report par bhi gaur karegi
 On 31 May last year, instead of releasing a full report on the issue, the Law Commission had said in the consultation paper that at this time the Uniform Civil Code is 'neither needed nor desired'
 ayog ne vivaah, talaak, guzaara bhatta tathaa mahilaon or purushon kii vivaah yogya aayu se sambandhit kanoonon main badlaav ke suzav die the
 The practice of immediate triple talaq (triple Talaq) was made a punishable offense in the Muslim Women (protection of Marriage Rights) Bill

 This decision of India will not be motivated by the anger generated in Tamil Nadu over the killing of Tamil civilians by the Sri Lankan army in the struggle against Tamil fighters
 nai dilli is baat se sahamat he ki dweep ke uttar purvi hisse main visthapiton ke punarvaas kaa kaam kuch had tak hua he, lekin srilanka rashtriya saamanjasy ke maamle main gambhir nahin dikh rahaa he
 The meeting going to be held in Geneva is different from the previous year
 pichley varsh bhi america ne maanavadhikaar or anya maamalon ko lekar srilanka ke khilaaf prastaav pesh kiya tha
 The American resolution was passed even after Colombo's million attempts
 47 sadasyeey yuanechaarsi kii sadsyta baari-baari se deshon ko milti he
 Russia, Cuba and China were supporters of Colombo last year, who are not on the council at this time
 pichley varsh srilanka dwaara washington ke saath baatcheet karne se inkaar karne ke baad bharat ne america rajanyikon se baatcheet kar prastaav ko thodaa naram karavaaya
 India removed the interfering references from the proposal
 anya vikasshil deshon kii hi tarah bharat bhi pashchim ke un kadamon ke prati samvedansheel rahata he, jinhen desh ke samprabhu maamalon main hastkshep ke jaisaa mana jaataa he
 This time Pakistan and some like-minded countries are talking to American diplomats on behalf of Sri Lanka
 tamilnadu ke vibhinn raajnneetik dhadon kii taraf se joardaar maang ke baavjood congress nit centre sarkaar ne is varsh matdaan ke dauraan apanaae jane vaale apane rukh kaa khulaasa nahin kiya he
 One reason for this is that the US proposal has to be revised and India is eyeing its final form
 duusari ek sambhaavna yah bhi he ki prastaav mataiky se sweekaar kiya jaae
 In such a situation, it will not be beneficial for India to reveal its cards at this point
 colombo ko lag rahaa he ki 2012 ke mukaable geneva main is baar baaji joardaar bichhi hui he
 Among the things that have a profound impact on the thinking of New Delhi are the disturbing mess being made by the Sri Lankan leadership after the complete destruction of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
 bharat mahasoos karata he ki raashtrapati mahinda rajpakshe yah bhaleebhanti jaanate hai ki sangharsh ke antim charan main kai tamil naagarik maare gaye the
 Public repentance and adequate compensation for such deaths may be declared

 He is repeatedly reiterating that no civilian was killed during the military action against the LTTE and that he is imposing responsibility for the civilian's death
 rashtriya sulah ke mudde par bhi colombo apane paanv peeche khinch rahaa he or sansad main sabase bade tamil samooh, tamil neshnal alliance ke saath baatcheet se inkaar kar chukaa he
 Sri Lankan move has hurt national consensus, while such a measure can help heal the wounds of a quarter-century struggle that took more than ten thousand lives
 bharat kaa yah faisla tamil ladaakon ke khilaaf sangharsh main srilankai sena dwaara tamil nagarikon kii hatya ko lekar tamilnadu main upje gusse se prerit nahin hoga
 New Delhi agrees that the rehabilitation of the displaced in the north eastern part of the island has been done to some extent, but Sri Lanka does not appear to be serious in terms of national cohesion
 geneva main hone ja rahi baithak har haal main pichley varsh se bhinn he
 Last year too, the US had moved a resolution against Sri Lanka on human rights and other matters
 colombo ke lakh prayaason ke baad bhi america prastaav paarit ho gaya tha
 Membership of the 47-member UNHRC is received by rotation in countries
 rus, cuba or china pichley varsh colombo ke samarthak the, jo is samay parishad main nahin hai
 After Sri Lanka refused to negotiate with Washington last year, India negotiated with US diplomats and softened the proposal
 bharat ne prastaav se hastkshep karne vaale sandarbhon ko hatwa diya
 Like other developing countries, India is also sensitive to the western steps which are considered to interfere in the sovereign affairs of the country
 is baar pakistan or kuch waisi hi soch rakhane vaale desh srilanka kii taraf se america rajanyikon se baatcheet kar rahe hai
 The Congress-led central government has not disclosed its stand to be adopted during the voting this year, despite strong demands from various political factions in Tamil Nadu
 iskaa ek kaaran yah bhi he ki america prastaav sanshodhit hona he or bharat uske antim rup par najar gadaaye hue he
 Another possibility is that the proposal should be accepted by consensus
 aisi sthiti main is mode par apane pattey jaahir karnaa bharat ke liye kahin se bhi laabhprad nahin rahegaa
 Colombo is feeling that this time in Geneva, compared to 2012, the bet is much bigger
 nai dilli kii soch par jin baton kaa gaharaa asar he unamem libration tigers of tamil ilam (littey) ko samul nasht kiye jane ke baad srilankai netritv dwaara buree tarah se kiya ja rahaa gadabadjhaalaa he
 India realizes that President Mahinda Rajapaksa is well aware that many Tamil civilians were killed in the last phase of the conflict
 aisi mauton ke liye saarvajanik pashchaatap or paryaapt muaavje kii ghoshnaa kii ja sakati he
 This move may slow down the burning flame in the minds of Tamils, as many people were dragged against their will during the conflict between Colombo and LTTE
 tippaniyan Instead, Sri Lanka is taking a strange stand
 vah baar-baar doharaa rahaa he ki littey ke khilaaf sainya karrwai ke dauraan koi bhi naagarik nahin maaraa gaya or nagarikon kii maut kii jimmedaari vah littey par thope rahaa he
 Colombo is also dragging its feet on the issue of national reconciliation and has refused to negotiate with the Tamil National Alliance, the largest Tamil group in Parliament
 srilanka ke is kadam se rashtriya sahmati khatai main pad gai he, jabaki aise upaay se das hajaar se zyada jindagi lilane vaale chauthai sadi tak chale sangharsh ke ghaavon ko bharne main madad mil sakati he

 According to Virendra Negi, not only did he defraud the banks but he also took crores of rupees from many moneylenders on 05 per cent to 15 per cent monthly loan
 virendra negi isi frodgiri main 1 baar jail ja chukaa he
 He came in jail for 18 months in a loan case from India Bulls, but absconded to Delhi after getting bail and there he was cheating people in the name of sending him abroad

 Virender Negi has been imprisoned for the first time in the same fraud
 india bulls se liye lone ke cese main vah 18 maheene jail main rahakar aayaa, lekin jamaanat milane par faraar hokar dilli chalaa gaya tha or vahaan bhi vah logon se videsh bhejne ke naam par thagi kar rahaa tha
 In addition to the station cant against Negi, cases are registered in several police stations in Dehradun
 tippaniyan Not only did Virendra Negi launder crores of rupees to the banks, but he had a setting with some people inside the bank, due to which he carried out such a big fraud
 usne lone dene vaale 60 bainkon ko 15 se lekar 25 pratishat kamishan diya, negi ne kis tarah bank karmiyon se milakar bank ko karodon kaa chunaa lagaaya aap bhi gaur se suniye
 In the interrogation of Negi, many important information has been handed over to the police

 pesheynt transport ambulance yani pitie ke taur par rajdhani main daudane vaali privet ambulance niyamon ko taakh par rakhkar chal rahi hai
 Neither oxygen cylinder, nor first aid box
 mahaj ek gaadi, jiske upar batti lagi hoti he or aage peeche ambulance likhaa hota he
 According to the rules, a car ambulance is made when it has a stretcher, first aid box and oxygen cylinder
 ye rajdhani main kisi sarkari aspataal ke baahar khadi ambulance shaayad niyamon kii andekhi na kar rahi hon
 We took stock of the reality outside the five hospitals
 usamen ames, safadarajang, alengepi, aaramail or jitibi hospital shaamil hai
 Some ambulance drivers accepted the mistake, while others started engaging in the rules
 adhiktar ke jawaab the ki choti gadiyon main first aid box hota hi nahin he
 
 ye niyam badi gadiyon ke liye he, jabaki box kaa na hona niyam kaa ulanghan he
 In many ambulances, the answer was found in the absence of oxygen cylinder, the patient is in the shop if he needs it
 ham le aaenge
 Messed up everywhere
 ambulance teen tarah kii hoti he
 ALS means Advanced Life Support, BLS i
e
 Basic Life Support and the third type is PTA ie Patient Transport Ambulance
 or yahi pitie dhadlle se niyamon kii dhajjiyaan udaane main lagi hai
 The answer to some was even more interesting
 
 
 "marane ke liye na oxigen silendar kii jarurat hoti he or na first aid box kii
 We only do the carcassing, but the rule says that ambulances are for patients and "HEARSE VAN" for carcassing vah nauveen class main padhgaye vaali ek maasoom ladki thi
 On seeing the 'cute' senior Prashant Jha of the eleventh class of his own school in Patna, his heartbeat used to intensify
 vah jab bhi use baahar jane ko kahata, vah khushi-khushi class banks karke uske saath long drive par nikal jaati thi
 In 2010, both of them had four eyes and in two years their relationship grew
 priya ko yakeen tha ki vah or prashanth (donon badale hue naam) ek-duusare ke liye hi bane hai
 Priya, who dreams of marrying in the eyes, paid no heed to the rumors flying about Prashant's affairs
 lekin prashanth ke iraade kuch or hi the
 In June 2012, when her parents decided to send her to Delhi for higher studies, she started thinking about getting rid of Priya
 lekin vah apane doston kii ek ghinauni baat ko maanane tak aisa nahin kar sakaa
 His friends told him to 'share' girlfriends
 phir 14 june ko prashanth ne apane dost sushant ke patna ke rajvansnagar sthit rambha apartment main priya ko bulaayaa
 There 17-year-old Priya kept on praying to save her father
 jindagi saath gujaarne kii kasame khaane vaala prashanth dur khadaa muskaraata rahaa jabaki uske dost rahul lamba or rahul urf ranvijay ne priya ke tan se saare kapadon ko nonch daalaa
 He alternately wired her fortune and the entire scandal was captured in a cellphone
 priya ne bataaya ki vah anya balaatkaariyon ko jaanati he (donon uske skool ke senior hai) or isse pehle ve kai baar usase sex sambandh banane kaa ishaara kar chuke the
 But he ignored her because he was Prashant's best friend
 in ladakon ne 43 minute kaa video shoot kiya or use june ke ant main ek sibar cafe se aplod kar diya gaya
 The 15-year-old Armaan, a junior from Pacific, first got this link
 usne turant hi yah baat chhipaane ke liye priya se sex sambandh banane kii maang kar daali
 a week later, Lamba invited Priya to a cyber cafe
 usne use yah video clip dikhaaya or vaada kiya ki agar vah ek baar phir apartment main chale to vah yah video nasht kar degaa
 She told Priya that if she did not agree, 'sushant Bhaiya' would tell her parents and the police everything
 vah flats par gai jahaan lamba or 26 varshiya sushant ne phir uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 This boosted his courage and he called him again a few days later
 aakhirkaar is baar priya ne unhen inkaar karne kii himmat juta lee
 Two months later, one day Priya woke up at midnight to sleep
 uskaa daraavna khwab khaufnak sachaai se judaa tha: uske parivaar ke logon ko pataa chalaa to unhen laga ki priya ne unki izzat ko mitti main mila diya he
 Priya, a victim of shock, cut herself off from the outside world
 usne apana fasebuk account delit kar diya
 Switched cell phones
 uske doston ke gharavaalon ne aisi 'kalankit' ladki se milane par roak laga di
 "I can't get out of this shock," says Priya in a jittery voice
 mujhe us par bahut bharosa tha
 The incident took a new shape when the Bihar Women's Commission (BWC) reached Priya and recorded her statement in front of the DGP
 iske baad aakhirkaar 24 july ko is maamle main exiar darj hui
 "his family did not want to register a case," says Kahkshan Parveen, the chairman of the commission
 vah ab bhi kaaphi najuk haalat main he
 We want the government and society to support him
 ''patna police ne armaan, prashanth, ranvijay, lamba, sushant or uske 27 varshiya gharelu naukar dinesh ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Prashant and Armaan are put in the Child Reform Home and the rest in Beur Jail
 balaatkaar kaa video itnaa bhayanak he ki yah shaayad us desh ko bhi jhakzor saktaa he jahaan har din 69 balaatkaar kaa ghinauna record he
 The National Crime Records Bureau says there were 25,125 incidents of rape in 2011
 priya kishaaron dwaara rape ke nae chalan kii shikaar he
 In 2011, 1,231 juveniles were arrested for raping 1,149
 isse saaf ishaara miltaa he ki kishor bhi gang rape main shaamil ho rahe hai
 The number of crimes against teenagers in the country is also increasing
 2001 main 399 rape kishoron ne kiya tha jabaki dashakabar baad 2011 main yah sankhya 1,149 par pahunch gai he
 The well-known sociologist of Patna, Dr
 hetukar jha kehete hai, ''ab der karnaa thik nahin
 We cannot wait to discuss sex with teenagers that they themselves ask us questions about sex
 unamem junun badhanaa nishchit rup se laalan-paalan kii samasya he
 "on a social network, Lamba has written in her favorite sport," Bed Games "and has described her choice to drink, go to parties and accompany girls
 prashanth kii maa apane bete kii aapraadhik pravriti ko sweekaar karti hai
 In fact, she wanted to send her son to a new place in the hope that he would improve upon going there
 ek pulicekarmi kehete hai, ''sex krime karne vaale logon ko gumraah karne or unhen chhalane main maahir hote hai
 "all the rapists have offered to marry Priya, in the hope that they will be released from jail
" prashanth ke skool certificate main uski janm tithi 26 march, 1994 darj he, jis vajah se vah police ko chhakaakar jail kii jagah bal sudhaar grih main hi rahane kii manjuuri hasil karne main safal ho gaya
 Chandramukhi Devi, a member of the Bihar Women's Commission, says, "as a society we try to hide the crimes of children
 lekin hamen yah baat samajni chahie ki aise zyaadaatar apradhi aage chalakar bade aparaadh main utar jate hai
 Often their cruelty also increases and they regularly commit crimes
 ''pichley saal mumbai main ek kishor ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha jisane apane saat peediton ke naam kaa sharir par tatu banavaa rakhaa tha
 With such terrible cases, India should wake up to a bitter and new truth
 apni beti aarushi or naukar hemraj ke katl ke iljaam main kareeb chaar saal se jail main band talwaar danpati aaj jail se reeha honge
 The Allahabad High Court acquitted the Talwar couple on Thursday, rejecting the CBI court's decision
 lekin 3 din se unki rihaai niyam-kaayadon main uljhi he
 Now the stains on the sword of the Talwar couple were washed away, but just think, what will they ever be able to compensate for what they have endured for so many days? Happiness is finally returning to the lonely eyes, suffering from grief and pain for years
 9 saal puraane aarushi hemraj murder cese main elahabaad hoicourt dwaara gajiabad kii vishesh sibiai adaalat kaa faisla palatney ke baad aarushi ke mata-pita noopur or rajesh talwaar aaj gajiabad kii dasna jail se reeha hone vaale hai
 The Talwar couple is about to get rid of the prison cell after about four years
 lekin ek sawaal baar-baar saal rahaa he, jo gaya wo kaise waapas aayega
 Denying all the pleas of Talwar couple's innocence, the CBI court on 26 November 2013 convicted Aarushi's parents on the basis of circumstantial evidence
 jaraa sochiye wo dard kitna gaharaa hoga
 How heavy that pain will be when a parent is put in jail for the crime of killing his own innocent beloved daughter
 ek maa ke us ahsaas ke bare main jisane apni maasoom beti ko khoyaa
 While pleading for justice, he was put in a dungeon for the same murder
 ummid he insaan ko jeene kaa haunsala detii he
 When expectations are broken, a person dies alive
 ummid kii jis roshni ko thamkar noopur or rajesh talwaar ne gajiabad kii dasna jail main gin-gin kar din or raat katate rahe, unki tapasya aakhirkaar kabool ho gai
 Next week is Diwali
 aarushi to nahin he, lekin arse baad talwaar danpati apane ghar main aarushi kii yaadon kaa diya jala sakengi
 Every festival, every single thing in his mind keeps going like a movie
 aarushiis duniya main nahin he, lekin apane parivaar kii yaadon aaj bhi jinda he
 After the death of Aarushi, the entire 9 years were spent cleaning the stains on her hands
 aarushi kii khubasurat yaadon kii potli dilon main hi dabi rah gai
 The blot of accusations of Aarushi's murder has been washed away
 talwaar danpati jail kii kaid se aaazaad ho jaaenge
 But after coming out of jail, will there be a tight mind to celebrate this freedom or to cry out that the daughter does not have access to the real murderer of the law? desh, duniya, mahanagar, khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 The Federal Reserve chief, Jerome Powell, has raised the fourth time in a year, ignoring the pressure of Trump
 america main byaaj daron main hue ijaphe se america share bazaar or sarkaar ke bond main giravat darj hui
 At the same time, the impact of this decision led to a fall in the stock markets around the world and a fall in global currencies against the dollar

 jirom powel ne ijaphe ke saath kaha he ki vah prati maah 50 billian dollar kii katautee apni balanceshit main karenge
 According to Powell, the US economy is currently strengthening with good economic data and therefore can raise interest rates to the extent that growth rates are not damaged

 In this situation, President Donald Trump believes that because of the rise in interest rates, the risk of negative impact on the growth rate in America, the central bank should not increase interest further

 Film Name: Bajrangi bhaijadirector: Kabir khanstar Cast: Salman Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Kareena Kapoor, Harshali Malhotra, Om Purirating: 4 / 5 As Salmanaka Superfan has appeared on the big screen for 355 days after the release of 'kick'
 isamen koi doraay nahin he ki 2009 main 'wanted' or phir '2010' main dabang ne cinema kaa salmaan johnor viksit kiya
 Despite the average storyline, Salman genre films proved to be superhit
 lekin 'bajrangi bhaijan' kahin se bhi is navviksit johnor kii film nahin he
 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' begins with the snowy plains of Kashmir, while after 2 hours 43 minutes, that snow is felt melting in the core of the eyes
 beete chah varshon main yah pehla mauka he, jab salmaan kii filmon ne manoranjan karne ke saath hi darshakon khaskar unke phens ko rulaaya he
 Although the lesson of sentimentality was also taught in 'kick', but then 'devil's Hangover' was more
 'bajrangi bhaijan'kaa tiger 28 may ko or trailor 18 june ko relies hua
 Curiosity about the film increased, though the story was only assessed
 aise main mujh jaise sainkadon phens ke liye film ko lekar utsukata banaae rakhane kii ekmaatr racippi salmaan thea
 On July 17, when Salman's entry on the screen in the theater, there was a lot of applause, but by the end of the applause, more handkerchief became more necessary
 aise main bahut sambhav he ki phens ke ek bade varg ko is baar thodi niraashaa hui ho
 
 
 
 lekin badal gaya mijaajayah film 2009 ke baad se salmaan khan or unki filmon ko lekar bane tamaam purvagrahon ko todatii he
 The story of the film is sweet and simple, with no scope for action and charismatic stunts
 yah acha he ki na to kabir khan or na hi salmaan ne aisa koi risk hi uthaaya
 In such a situation, after a long time, it is nice to see your hero in a serious character
 usase bhi adhik khushi tab hoti he, jab ab tak salmaan ke dhur virdohi rahe aalochak dabe hue shabdon main hi sahi film kii safalataa or isamen salmaan kii saraahna karte hai
 The director next time to pay attention here, seeing the success of 'bajrangi Bhaijaan', Salman Khan has recently announced that he is going to do a third film with Kabir Khan
 kabir khan achche diarector hai
 This was his second film with Salman Khan, but the one who missed Kami 'ek Tha Tiger' is also with this film
 kabir sahab, jab aapke paas kehane ke liye itnaa kuch he to aap parde par shuruaati maahaul banane main itnaa samay kyon laga dete hai
 Like 'ek Tha Tiger' the beginning of 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' is also slow
 film jab tak apni rau main aati he thodi ubaau lagane lagati he
 But by the end everything gets better
 'prem' kii vaapasi ke sanketais baar film main salmaan kaa abhinay paksh bhi dekhne ko mila he or vah apni 'dabang' chhavi se baahar nikalne ke liye prayasarat dikhte hai

 That is, if everything goes well, 'prem' is going to come back on the screen once again
 navazuddin kii entry film ko gati detii he
 Salman is much more an entertainer than an actor
 vah yah jaanate hai ki parde par navazuddin kii acting unhen frem se gaayab kar sakati he, lekin iske baavjood jis tarah unhone lagaataar duusari baar navazuddin kaa saath chunaa he, yah unki mahanata he
 Because apparently no big actor wants to let a better artist flourish in front of him
 navazuddin agali id relies 'sultan' main salmaan kaa saath denge
 Harshali is the life of the film in the character of Shahida / Munni
 vah vaaki film kii trump card he
 Even without saying anything, his innocence falls on everyone in every frame
 karina ke hisse zyada kuch nahin he, lekin vah sundar lagi hai
 The film has a song for Har Pahar
 salmaan kii entry se lekar dargah par ibaadat or raaston kii mashkkat tak, har samay koi na koi geet chalata rahata he
 In such a situation, 'aaj Ki Party' track could also be put somewhere in the middle
 
 
 
 Because everything is not cinema, there are some scenes in the film that do not get embraced
 masalan, antim seen main logon dwaara seemaa par latake taale ko todna or naitik banakar apni-apni seemaa main hi khadey rahanaa
 Surrender to the Pakistani army in a non-practical manner and to the government or in the opening scene, Shahida got off the train, but at the last moment the cavalry guard guarding the train disappeared
 khayr itnaa chalata he kyonki sabakuch asal jaisaa ho to wo cinema kaise kehalaayegaa or phir manoranjan bhi ek baat hoti he
 But it is also true that life is not cinema
 yah filmpakistanmen bhi relies hui he
 From the border to politics, any expectation from the Pakistan Army and Government has now become meaningless, in such a situation, the hope is that at least the 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' will tie our brothers in the emotional strings and that too Shahida, Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi and Chand will agree with political dictators on the pretext of Muhammad, because the relationship between the two countries will come sometime in the morning

 tippaniyan During the hearing, Subramanian told the Supreme Court that the Crime Branch Police of Kerala is investigating it
 diamond kii keemat 21 lakh rupee hone kaa anumaan he
 However, its real value cannot be valued in rupees because it is considered a heritage due to its antiquity
 aise main mandir kaa register bhi jaancha janaa chahie jisase yah pataa chal sake ki gaayab heere kii keemat kya tay kii ja sakati he
 Gopal also told the court that the temple register shows that the missing diamonds are around 70-80 years old
 yah khabar chaunkaane vaali he kyonki 10 maheene pehle purv lekhaakaar vinod roy ne apni report main kaha tha ki mandir se 186 karod rupee kaa sona gaayab he

 gopal ne court ko yah bhi bataaya ki mandir ke register se yah pataa chalata he ki gaayab heere kareeb 70-80 saal puraane hai
 The news is shocking as former accountant Vinod Roy in his report 10 months ago said that gold worth Rs 186 crore is missing from the temple

 The news is shocking as former accountant Vinod Roy in his report 10 months ago said that gold worth Rs 186 crore is missing from the temple
 adaalat ke aadesh par pehle bhi audit kiya tha or paaya gaya tha ki sone ke 769 bartan gaayab hai
 For the last few years, it has been in the limelight due to the mess of the temple management
 yah khabar chaunkaane vaali he kyonki 10 maheene pehle purv lekhaakaar vinod roy ne apni report main kaha tha ki mandir se 186 karod rupee kaa sona gaayab he
 The court had earlier audited the order and it was found that 769 gold vessels were missing
 pichley kuch saalon se yah mandir prabandhan kii gadabadi kii lekar surkhiyon main rahaa he
 Within the next 12 months, such a technology can knock in the market, which will make it easy to find out how full your wounds are

 kerala ke sabarimala mandir main 10 se 50 saal ke bich kii umr kii mahilaon ke pravesh par pratibandh ke maamle main supreme court ne shuukravaar ko mandir board tathaa sarkaar se kai sawaal kiye
 The Supreme Court asked that when discrimination between women and men has not been done in the Vedas, Upanishads or any scripture, why is this so in Sabarimala? Hearing the petition of the Young Lawyers Association Has filed a petition
 court ab is maamle kii sunwaayee karegaa ki kyamahilaon ke pravesh par pratibandhko sthai kiya ja saktaa he yaa nahin?court ne puranic granthon kaa udhaaharan diyacourt ne kaha ki- bhagavat gita ke mutabik bhagwaan krishna har jagah hai or har kisi main vaas karte hai
 God has not discriminated between women and men
 bhagavad gita granth main bhi iskaa zikr he
 In such a situation, how can a woman's entry into the temple of God be banned
 court ne poocha ki kya hindu dharm main aisa koi niyam he ki jo yah kahata ho ki mahilaon ko mandir main pravesh kii ijaajat nahin he
 This remark has been made by a bench of Supreme Court Judge Deepak Mishra while hearing a petition filed on Friday prohibiting the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple in Kerala
 rajya sarkaar kanoon kaa paalan karesupreme court ne kerala sarkaar se kaha ki is maamle ko lekar niyam va kanoon kii baat karen or koibhaavnaatmak daleel na den
 If there is a mention in Hinduism that someone can be prevented from entering the house of God, that is, then they should inform the court of the law and the text
 yahaan par tark suna jayega, bhaavnaatmak apil nahin
 6 weeks 'time sought from the court The Government of Kerala sought 6 weeks' time from the Supreme Court to file its reply in this matter
 jise supreme court ne sweekaar kar liya he
 Now the next hearing of this case will be on April 11
 vahiin, mandir prabandhan or kerala sarkaar kii ore se adaalat ke saamne daleel di gai ki sabarimala mandir main kai dashakon se yah pratha chali aa rahi he
 The religious faith of the people is associated with it
 mandir kii vyavastha kanoon nahinis par supreme court ne kaha ki yah mandir kii vyavastha to kahi ja sakati he, magar kanoon nahin
 According to the law, women and men are equal and both are allowed to enter the temple
 supreme court ne is maamle main yachikakarta kii ore se adaalat ke saamne pairvi ke liye varisht vakil raju ramchandran ko emicas cury niyukt kiya he
 At the same time, the Supreme Court asked Ram Jethmalani, senior advocate in the case, whether he can plead in the court on behalf of the petitioner in this case
 kai dashakon se chal rahi he prathapichhali sunwaayee par kerala sarkaar ne supreme court main apana jawaab daayar karte hue kaha tha ki sabarimala mandir main kai dashakon se mahilaon ko pravesh kii anumati nahin he
 This arrangement is already decided according to the religious faith of the people
 isliye sabarimala mandir main mahilaon ko pravesh kii anumati nahin di ja sakati
 The government had said that it is our duty to defend the centuries-old tradition
 samvidhan main mahilaon ko adhikarrajya sarkaar ne apane halafname main ye bhi kaha tha ki ye mahaj puraani parampara kii baat nahin he
 Our constitution also gives the right to the temples to whom it enters the temple, not to whom
 saath hi samvidhan hamen dharmik swatantraaa kaa haq bhi detaa he
 The Kerala government, taking a U-turn from its earlier talk, immediately withdrew the Kerala government affidavit in 2007 and filed a new affidavit
 purv main varsh 2007 main sipiai sarkaar ne apane halafname main kaha tha ki court is maamle main khud hi nirnay le
 Restrictions on women of menstrual age, in the public interest of the Indian Young Liars Association, have been demanded that the court pass an order for women of all ages to enter the temple
 abhi tak masik dharm vaali umr kii mahilaon kaa, mandir main pravesh par roak he
 There is no restriction in the Sabarimala temple on the entry of girls before this age group and older women and old women after that

 ’ Like Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party is now going to contest the Lok Sabha elections alone in Haryana
 aam aadmi party ke haryana sanyojak naveen jaihind ne twit kar kaha ki 'haryana main aap sabhi 10 loksabhaa or 90 vidhansabha par apane dam par chunaav ladegi
 Negotiated alliance with JJP
 isse pehle aam aadmi party or jananaayak janata party (JJP) ke bich gathbandhan ko lekar baat ho rahi thi
 But due to the inability to talk about the seat sharing, both the parties have decided to go alone in the elections
 naveen jaihind ne kaha ki JJP hamen 10 main se keval 2 seat de rahi he or badale main dilli main ek seat maang rahi he
 Our proposal is not acceptable to our party
 hamaara aisa maananaa he ki agar yah gathbandhan hota he to isse keval bijepi ko hi faaydaa hoga
 He said that we explained a lot to JJP but she is not agreeing
 haryana main aap 10LS or 90VS par apane dam par chunaav ladegi
 Negotiated alliance with JJP
 JJP hamen 10 main se keval 2 seat de rahi he or badale main dilli main ek seat maang rahi he
 Don't know which world it is
 is se keval bjp ko hi faaydaa hoga
 Explained a lot but JJP is not agreeing
 aam aadmi party ne haal hi main hue jind vidhansabha up-chunaav main JJP ke ummidavaar digvijay chautaala kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Aam Aadmi Party's Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Gupta also actively campaigned for the JJP candidate
 khud aam aadmi party ke mukhiya or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal JJP ummidavaar ke liye prachaar karne jind bhi gaye the
 Explain that Haryana is a state adjoining Delhi
 dilli main aam aadmi party kii sarkaar he
 Therefore, after Delhi and Punjab, the party is now pushing for elections in Haryana
 khud party ke mukhiya arvind kejariwal lagaataar haryana ke alag-alag ilaakon main raily karke dilli sarkaar ke skool or aspataal main kiye gaye kaamon kaa jamkar bakhaan kar rahe hai
 The party was hopeful that it would do well in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections by forging an alliance with JJP, but the party has suffered four setbacks in a row due to the failure of the alliance
 aapako dhyaan ho ki JJP asal main haryana ke chautaala parivaar ke indian neshnal lokdal se nikali party he
 There were differences in the Chautala family after which Om Prakash Chautala, former Haryana Chief Minister and head of the party, expelled his grandson and MP Dushyant Chautala from the party

 In the previous hearing, the Center had said that the hearing of the case should be postponed for the present as the Center is seriously considering enacting a law to protect people's data in whatsapp, Facebook and other apps
 centre sarkaar ye bhi dekh rahi he ki kya esa kanoon banaaya ja saktaa he jiske tahat sarvice prowider yaa ap ke data share karne par bain lagaaya ja sake

 centre kii ore sekhaghmukul rohtagi ne kaha ki eps ko istemaal karne vaale kaa soshal media platform par profile taiyaar ho jaataa he jise baad main bazaar main vyavsaayik taur par bech diya jaataa he
 In fact, the petition filed in the Supreme Court has said that it violates the right to privacy
 supreme court main iske liye samvidhan peeth kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 Last January, while hearing a petition filed for personal data and privacy in the matter of connecting whatsapp's data to Facebook, the Supreme Court had issued notices to the Center, TRAI, whatsapp and Facebook seeking answers in two weeks
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki har vyakti kii privesi kaa maamla he or centre sarkaar ko iske liye koi niyam banaaya janaa chahie watsap ke fasebuk se data share karne kaa maamla sidhe sidhe privesi ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan he
 Therefore, there should be a rule made by TRAI, this matter is related to the data of 155 million people
 haalanki chif justise je es khehar ne yachikakarta se poocha tha ki ye free sarvice he
 If you fear data sharing, why do you use it? Either you take it or leave this service
 tippaniyan In fact, on 23 September last year, the Delhi High Court had asked whatsapp to delete the user data till 25 September
 hoicourt kaa kahana tha ki25sitambar se pehle agar koi yujar apana acount delit karata he or use fasebuk ke saath saajha nahin karata he to company ko soochna sarwar se delit kerani hogi
 But after September 25, whatsapp can share data with Facebook
 yah faisla hoicourt ne us janhit yachika ke tahat diya tha jisamen watsap kii shering policy par sawaal uthaaya gaya tha
 Let me tell you that before whatsapp changed its policy, it was talked about sharing the data of its users with Facebook
 company ke mutabik iskaa makasad yuzars tak sateek vigyaapan pahunchaana tha
 The central government is also looking at whether a law can be made under which service providers or apps can be banned from sharing data
 diwali tak is par kaam puraa ho jayega
 AG Mukul Rohatgi, on behalf of the Center, said that the profile of the user using the apps is created on the social media platform, which is then sold commercially in the market

 aaj tak ke khaas kaarykram sidhi baat main india today ke sampadak or india today group ke sampadakeey nideshak prabhu chawla ne rashtravaadi congress party ke pramukh sharad pavaar se baat kii
 Pawar gave his impeccable opinion on issues like Lok Sabha elections and becoming his Prime Minister
 pavaar ne bataaya ki vah is baar loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladanaa nahin chaahate the lekin unki team ke saathiyon ne kaha ki unhen loksabhaa janaa chahie
 He also said how the party would have proceeded without a leader, so he agreed to contest elections
 is baar chunavon main pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main bhi sharad kaa naam kai baar uchhla
 On this, Pawar says that it is necessary to have data to become PM and NCP has less candidates
 bhaajapa ke piem in vatting laalkrishna adwani or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi dwaara pradhanmantri doctor manmohan singh ko kamjor pradhanmantri bataane ke maamle par pavaar ne kaha ki narendra modi ko gairjimmedaran bayaan dene kii aadat he par adwani bhi aisa kar rahe hai jo ascharyajanak he
 Praising Manmohan Singh, he said that he is a very good person and a strong Prime Minister
 sharad pavaar ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ko prashasan aana chahie or chhavi saaf honi chahie tathaa tajurba bhi hona chahie or manmohan kaa tajurba acha he
 Sharad Pawar said that Manmohan Singh is the candidate for the post of PM from the Congress and not from the UPA
 unhone bataaya ki 6 maheene pehle hi ensipi ne congress ke saamne prastaav rakhaa tha ki manmohan ko upie kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar janata ke saamne jaaya jaae, par congress ne kisi kaaran aisa nahin kiya
 So now after the elections it will be decided who will be the candidate for the post of Prime Minister from UPA
 chunaav kii baad upie kii baithak main sarvasammati se piem ummidavaar par faisla liya jayega
 Sharad Pawar said that the country is progressing and agricultural production is increasing
 haalanki kisaanon kii durdasha ke bare main unhone kaha ki desh main pani or bijli kii samasya badi he
 Apart from this, there are many difficulties before the farmers
 pavaar ne kaha ki upie ke shasankaal main kisaanon ko unki fasalon kii acchhee keemten mili or sabsidi bhi di gai
 On the issue of BJP raising the issue of black money deposited in Swiss bank, Pawar said that black paddy has gone out before but nobody raised voice
 unhone sawaal uthaaya ki endie 6 saal satta main rahi tab usne is maamle main koi kadam kyon nahin uthaaya
 When told by the media that Rahul Gandhi was the candidate for the post of PM, Pawar said that Rahul is not yet the candidate for the post of PM
 unhone kaha ki rahul khud kai baar kah chuke hai ki wo abhi piem pad ke ummidavaar nahin hai or jab rahul ummidavaar honge to ensipi unhen samarthan dene par vichaar karegi
 In Pawar's opinion, a government cannot be formed without the help of the Left and it is difficult to form a Third Front government
 jab unase poocha gaya ki left ne to upie ko samarthan nahin dene kii ghoshnaa kii he to pavaar ne kaha ki chunaav ke baad left badal saktaa he
 Continuing to persuade Mohammad Yusuf, the Pakistan Cricket Board has urged the batsman to once again return from retirement and file an appeal against the indefinite ban imposed on him
 pisibi ke jaankaar sutron ne bataaya ki yusuf ko march main unke upar lagaaye pratibandh ke khilaaf apil karne ko kaha gaya he

 yusuf ne iske antarrashtriya cricket se sanyas kii ghoshnaa kar di thi or pratibandh ke khilaaf apil nahin kii

 bat ne yahaan ek channel se kaha, ‘vah ab bhi vishwa stareey khilaadi he or usamen kuch varshon kaa cricket bachaa he
 The national team needs him and he should reconsider his decision to retire
 ’ In 2013, the Supreme Court stayed the proceedings against Kanth in the lower court
 kanth kii yachika par sibiai se bhi jawaab talab kiya gaya tha
 Amod Kanth has challenged the order of the Patiala House court to summon him in 2010 in the matter of allowing additional seats in the gift cinema
 1997 main hue is agnikand main 59 darshakon kii mrityu ho gai thi
 Earlier, Amod Kanth had approached the Delhi High Court
 raahat nahin milane par unhone sheersh adaalat main yachika daayar kii
 On behalf of Kanth, it was stated in the court that the High Court did not take into account the fact that the CBI had failed to get approval for proceedings against him
 agnikand ke peediton ke anurodh par hi nichali adaalat ne 12 agast 2010 ko amod kanth ko samman jari kiya tha
 The High Court rejected the argument made by the former IPS officer that he could not be prosecuted in the case of allowing additional seats in the gift cinema as the investigating agency has not obtained approval for the same
 hai court ne kaha ki agar vah nichali adaalat main yah sawaal uthaayenge to vahiin par is masale par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The High Court also rejected Kanth's plea that the lower court had erred by rejecting the CBI case closure report giving him a clean chit

 It is only till August 31 to file ITR, if you do not file ITR, then it may take up to 5 thousand to avoid filling the ITR form
 It is till August 31 to file Income Tax Return (ITR) i
e
 till today
 There are only three days left
 jo log abhi tak inakam tex ritern nahin daakhil kar paae hai, unke liye ab bhi mauka he, ise tatkaal kar len
 Filing ITR has become much easier now by going online, in spite of this, if you are facing any problem then you should take help of a chartered accountant
 agar aap tex ke daayre main aate hai or aapane itiar daakhil nahin kiya to aapke upar inakam tex vibhaag 5 hajaar rupee tak kaa jurmaana laga saktaa he
 You have to fill the income tax return form very carefully
 aapaki suvidha ke liye ham aisi paanch aam galatiyon ke bare main bataa rahe hai jo aksar log karte hai
 By avoiding such mistakes, you can fill the return form correctly
 1
 Filling the wrong ITR formtax and investment expert Balwant Jain explains, 'first of all you should know which ITR form you have to fill
 galat form bharaa to puri kavayad kaa koi phayda nahin hoga
 Most people have to fill ITR-1, which is called Sahaj
 agar aap aise indiviual taxpere hai jinaki kul salanaa aay 50 lakh rupee se kam (sabhi sroton se) he to aapako yah form bharna hoga
 But if you have an annual income of more than 50 lakh rupees, more than one housing property, directorship in a company, income from capital gains, income from abroad, then you have to fill ITR-2
 ' kisi kaarobaar yaa profeshan se aay karne vaale indivijulls yaa hindu avibhajit parivaar (HUF) ko ITR-3 daakhil karnaa hota he
 2
 anya strot se hui aay ko na batanaselary yaa kaarobaar ke mukhya aay ke alaava aapako anya sroton se hone vaali aay ko bhi jarur bataanaa chahie
 Saving bank interest is exempt from taxable income up to Rs 10,000 for ordinary people and up to 50,000 for senior citizens, but you have to claim deduction by showing this information in income
 epady par tids kataa he to uske bare main bhi aapako jaankadi deni chahie
 Penalty may also apply if you hide the information
 yah tex chori kaa 50 se lekar 200 fisadi tak ho sakati he
 The income of minor children must also be given
 miner kii active inakam he jaise kisi tivi sho se aay to vah bachche ke liye texable hogi, lekin pasive inakam he, jaise uske naam par kisi nivesh se aay he to yah salanaa 1500 rupee tak kii kar mukt he, usase zyada hone par maa yaa baap kii aay main (jisaki bhi aay zyada hoti he) judega
 People often forget to mention capital gains from mutual funds or shares; Salaried people make more mistake while filling the details of capital gains, because their information seems too complicated for them
 isliye agar aapaki capital gains se inakam he to kisi profeshnal sie kii madad jarur leni chahie
 3
 ek se zyada makaan kii jaankaree na denaayek se zyada makaan he to itiar-1 form kaa istemaal nahin kar sakate
 You have to fill ITR-2
 agar ek se zyada makaan kaa self ocupation he to pichley saal ke niyam ke mutabik sirf ek hi makaan ke liye chhot milegi, duusare makaan ke liye market rate par rental inakam bataani hogi jis par 30 fisadi kaa didction bhi miltaa he
 4
 contact detail apadet na karnayah bahut hi jaruri he ki aap apana i-mail idi or phone number apadet karen
 Now-a-days the Income Tax department makes contact only through e-mail or phone
 yah dhyaan rakhen ki employr ke dwaara mila i-mail idi yaa phone number na den balki apana personal i-mail yaa phone number den, kyonki naukari chhootane par aapkaa personal contact hi kaam aayega
 5
 sabhi bank khaaton kaa vivaran na denasabhi bank acount kii detail inakam tex ritern main deni chahie
 If you fill the details in the form of ITR, then fill the bank account in it very carefully because nowadays refund comes directly into the account online
 isliye itiar main yah vivaran dena hota he ki aap rifund koun-se acount main chaahate hai
 If there is a mistake, there will be a lot of problem in processing it again

 magar phir bhi isamen ek vijan dikhataa he, jo aane vaale varshon main desh kii arthvyavastha main badlaav kaa sanket detaa he
 The aviation crisis and opening of FDI in other sectors will help them to get out of the crisis
 sarkaar kii ore se 100 se adhik shram kanoonon kii jagah sirf chaar tarah ke kanoon laane kii vyavastha ko ek krantikari kadam mana ja rahaa he
 It is being told that the initiative to reform labor laws shows that the Modi government has caught that weak vein, due to which there are many similarities with China, India could not become a manufacturing hub compared to it
 arthshaastriyon ke mutabik, pichhali kai sarkarein lebar kanoonon main sudhaar kaa saahas nahin juta pain, magar modi sarkaar ne ise badalane kii pahal kii he
 This is auspicious sign

 Sharma said that the government has really taken many important, necessary and new steps in the budget
 masalan, sankat main chal rahe sookshm, madhyam evam laghu udyog (emesai) sector ko bachaane ke liye 35 hajaar karod rupee kii vyavastha kar sarkaar ne shubh sanket die hai
 The enterprises registered in GST will get its benefit
 neshnal or riginal stock exange ke saath ab ek nayaa soshal stock exange shuru karne kii pahal acchhee he

 According to Sharma, the decision to introduce FDI in the aviation, media and insurance sectors will prove to be helpful in saving all the companies sinking from losses
 agar aviation main pehle se epadiai kii vyavastha hoti to haal main ghate se kuch vimaanan companiyaan band hone kii kagaar par nahin pahunchatin

 sharma ke mutabik, ajukeshan par jidipi kaa 6 pratishat kharch karne kii maang uth rahi thi
 But having no provision for this is a bit disappointing
 haalanki neshnal research foundation banane kii baat kahkar sarkaar ne shaikshin gunvattta ko lekar patibaddhta jarur jataai he
 Pro
 sharma kehete hai, agar is bajet ke sabase bade factors kii baat karen to vah he modi sarkaar kii ore se lebar riforms kii taraf badaye gaye kadam
 Many previous governments could not muster courage about this
 magar modi sarkaar ne 100 se adhik shram kanoonon ko sirf chaar kanoonon main sametane kii baat kii he
 This can be a revolutionary step
 isse na keval inspectorraj khatm hoga, balki kal-kaarkaanon or companiyon ko raahat milegi
 Pro
 sharma lebar riforms ke mahatv par kehete hai ki isse bharat china ko takkar de saktaa he
 Actually China and India have many similarities
 jansankhya bhi donon deshon kii zyada he or shram bhi sasta he
 Growth rate is also good
 magar china to manuphaccharing hub ban gaya, lekin bharat nahin
 The main reason for this is that China has only one labor law, whereas in India there are more than 100 types of labor law companies
 piesu bainkon ko bachaane ke liye 70 hajaar karod rupee dene kii pahal bhi acha kadam he
 a rebate of up to three and a half lakh on housing loan will give some benefit to the working class
 haalanki mandi kii maar jhel rahe auto sector ko bachaane ke liye sarkaar ne kuch intjaam is bajet main nahin bataae
 This is the transformational budget: Prof

 Good initiative has been taken towards the empowerment of women
 corporate tex main kami se iconomi badhegi
 Multinational companies had to pay tax of up to 45 percent till now, leading many multinationals to turn to China instead of India and other countries of the world
 magar corporate tex ghataakar sarkaar ne multinational companiyon ko bharat main aane ke liye aakarshith kiya he
 However, due to no change in the tax slab, the budget did not do much for the employed people

 sunil gavaskar ne maujuuda samay ke mahaan ballebaajon par charchaa kigavaskar ne kaha- temprament aapako dusron se kaaphi alag banaata hepurv bhartiya captain sunil gavaskar ne maujuuda samay ke mahaan ballebaajon par charchaa kii he
 Sunil Gavaskar has given his opinion on the batting technique of Australian batsman Steve Smith
 sunil gavaskar ne steve smith kii tarif karte hue kaha ki smith kii sirf ballebaaji takanic hi nahin balki temprament bhi unhen baaki ballebaajon se alag banaata he
 Gavaskar said, 'I have always talked about temperament, not just technology
 mere liye temprament aapako dusron se kaaphi alag banaata he
 Technology is fine
 aapke paas uchit takanic honi chahie
 But if you have a large temperament, you are most likely to succeed
 'smith ke mureed hue gavaskargavaskar ke mutabik steve smith aaj ke daur ke sabase behtareen ballebaajon kii hode main shaamil hai
 Recently, he scored runs during the Ashes series, presenting his best batting sample
 bataa den ki haal hi main smith ne england ke khilaaf ashes siries ke chaar maichon main 774 ran banaae the, jisamen unka sarvocch score 211 rahaa
 Shastri said on Dhoni's retirement - Mahi has the power to decide that in this series, England bowlers tried to dismiss Smith at slip
 unke paas teen slip or ek gali thi
 But Smith shuffled to the off stump, covering his off stump and opening the leg stump
 vah gend ko chhod rahe the or gendon kaa chayan badi chaturaai se kar rahe the
 Whenever a leg slip was made for Smith, he did not leave the leg stump as he knew that the bowlers were targeting this area and if he shuffled it would be difficult for him to keep the ball on the ground
 lekin agar aap apane baayen pair se leg stump ko cover karte hai to aap hameshaa gend ke upar rahenge
 Smith has also regained the No
 1 spot in the Test rankings with his best performance

 chennai super kings ke captain mahendra sih dhoni ne kaha he ki ek finishr kaa kaam maidan par apane saathi ballebaaj kii madad karne ke saath-saath match ko finnish karnaa he

 Achieved by scoring runs
 dhoni ne match ke baad kaha, 'jab aap ballebaaji kar rahe hai, to jaruri he ki duusare chor par maujuud ballebaaj kii bhi madad karen
 Tell them what strategy the bowler can adopt against your batting style
 ek finishr kaa kaam match ko finnish karne ke saath-saath apane saathi ballebaaj se maidan par ran banane ko lekar charchaa karnaa bhi he
 These things matter a lot on the field
 'finishr dhoni aise bane chennai superkings kii jeet ke hirodhoni us samay ballebaaji karne ke liye maidan par aae the, jab chennai ko 66 gendon par 132 ran banane the, jabaki usne 74 ran par apane chaar wicket ganvaa die the
 There was a 101-run partnership for the fifth wicket between Dhoni and Ambati Rayudu
 dhoni ko unke is shandaar pradarshan ke liye 'main of da match' kaa puraskaar mila
 The captain said, 'looking at the de Villiers' batting, it seemed difficult to chase this goal
 mujhe lagata he ki hamane 15-20 ran zyada de die
 After that we also lost the wickets of some good batsmen in the beginning
 lekin, maidan chota tha
 The ball was coming on the bat and later there was some dew
 kul milakar sab kuch ranneeti ke anusaar hua
 'there was a danger of defeat, then Mahi's bat and victory was won' Man of the match ' Will bowl
 saath yah bhi dhyaan rakhana jaruri he ki us wicket par koun gendbaaj sabase acchhee gendbaaji kar saktaa he, jise aap gend saupana chahenge

 yah lokanrity raajaaon-maharaajaaon ke darbaron kii shaan rahaa he to isamen gramin pardadari, mitti kii khushboo or samskruti kii mahak bhi milti he
 In Bundelkhand, the women of Bedi caste carried this dance forward, but later it has also led to disorientation due to some obscenity songs and steps
 ab jhaansi kii yuva ladki baby imran ne apni maa ke saath milakar rai-saira kii badnaam viraasat ko na sirf dhoyaa he, balki ise punerjeevit kar aadhunik steps ke jariye yuva peedi kii pasand bana raheen hai
 Baby Imran, who started with Kathak, was impressed by his mother Parveen Khan's folk dance
 unki maa ek chrishchiyan parivaar se hai or pita muslim, lekin parivaar ke logon ne baby ko rai dance ke liye khulkar saport kiya
 He started rai-saira with his mother at a young age

 baby imran kahati hai, ''rai lokanrity mere liye ek tapasya he
 For the past few years, people were considering Rai folk dance as obscene dance, but i have been able to make it a special choice of youth by turning it into ancient tradition with full dignity
 bacchon ko sikhaane ke liye apane ghar mukrat class bhi laga rahi hum
 People are getting very good response during the show, but i feel that Bundelkhandi folk dance like Rai is still required to go out of the regional arena and get a big national recognition
 ''imran salbhar main kareeb ek darjan kaarykram bade manchon par kar leti hai
 His dance has earned him fame by putting it on youtube by a local company
 unka apana utyub channel haal hi main aayaa he

 " rahul gandhi antat congress ke nae adhyaksh chun liye gaye hai
 In this oldest party of the country, the Rahul era has formally started
 haalanki ye bhi sach he ki rahul kii tajposhi kaa vakt congress kaa sabase bura vakt bhi he
 The Congress came under 50 seats in the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, but after that, it also lost power from one state to another, which further weakened the party that was weakened
 jaahir he ki congress ke nae adhyaksh ke sir par kaanton kaa taj he
 The challenges before him will really test him
 congress ko majbootee denacongress adhyaksh ke taur par rahul gandhi ke saamne sabase badi chunauti party ko majbootee dena he
 After the defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress lost power in consecutive states
 rahul gandhi aise vakt par congress kii kaman sanbhaalane ja rahe hai jab party simatakar sirf chah rajyon tak rah gai he
 In such a situation, the responsibility of rebuilding the organization will be on Rahul's shoulders
 rahul gandhi ke saamne sabase badi party main nai jaan daalane kii he
 Landing the Congress on the ground is the biggest challenge for Rahul Gandhi
 congress ne netaa to hai, lekin kaaryakarta najar nahin aate hai
 The biggest problem before the Congress is to put the party on the booth label
 maujuuda daur main congress kii haar kii sabase badi vajah booth str par party kaa na hona
 Whereas bjp's roots are strong to the booth level
 congress ko majboot karne ke liye booth str par bijepi kii tarj main taiyaar karnaa hoga
 Creating a new approach Rahul Gandhi has been active on social media of late, but now he has made a strong presence
 rahul gandhi ne apane bhaashanon main aise desi shabd istemaal karne shuru kiye hai, jo aam logon or gali-gali tak unki pahunch ko badhaate hai
 He has impressed with his new avatar, but the biggest challenge is to give a new direction and perspective to the party
 viraasat se baahar nikalnaa hogaarahul gandhi kii ab tak kii pahchaan jawahar laal nehru or indira gandhi kii viraasat ke taur par he
 Rahul seems burdened by the ideology of his great-grandfather
 jabaki maujuuda daur ke voters kii apekshaaon ko puraa karne ke liye unhen isse baahar nikalnaa hoga
 PM Narendra Modi is known for direct communication with the poor, in such a way Rahul Gandhi will have to find similar ways
 modi lahar kaa saamanaarahul gandhi kaa muqabla maujuuda pradhanmantri narendra modi se he, jo bijepi kii jeet ke mantra ban chuke hai
 With the help of Modi wave, BJP has won the success of successive states
 assam jaise congress ke majboot kile ko bhi dharaashahee karke bijepi satta par virajman hui he
 The biggest challenge before Rahul is to make his wind up against the Modi wave
 majboot vipaksh kii bhoomikacongress ke haathon jin vajahon se satta gai or bijepi kii satta ke daur main congress ko lekar jis tarah modi sarkaar bephikr he uski vajah do hi hai
 First, the Congress has been weak in the role of the opposition and the BJP has always been strong in the role of the opposition
 aise main congress ko vipaksh kii bhoomika main lautnaa hoga or modi sarkaar ke khilaaf sadak se sansad tak sangharsh karnaa rahul ke liye sabase badi chunauti hogi
 Balancing Between senior-junior Leaders One challenge before Rahul Gandhi is to create better coordination between senior and junior leaders of the party
 kai rajyon main party ke varisht or yuva netaaon ke bich raajnneetik khinchataan jari he
 The relationship between Ashok Gehlot vs Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan, Digvijay Singh vs Jyotiraditya Scindia in MP, Sheila Dixit vs Ajay Maken in Delhi is well known
 khud kii 'non syrius' chhavi se baahar nikalnaarahul gandhi ko bijepi non syrius leader ke taur par pesh karti rahi he
 From BJP President to PM Modi, Rahul has been described as an immature leader
 aise main rahul ke saamne is chhavi ko todane ke saath hi virodhiyon ko jawaab dene kii chunauti hogi
 Winning the assembly elections, Rahul's challenge As Congress president, the burden of responsibility has increased even more on the shoulders of Rahul Gandhi
 gujarat or himachal vidhansabha chunaav pehali pariksha he
 Assembly elections are due in eight states of the country next year
 jinamein madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, rajasthan or karnataka jaise bade rajya shaamil hai
