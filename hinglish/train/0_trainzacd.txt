 Rajnath said that during the NDA rule there were no allegations against those involved in the government

 This led to the Adarsh society scam

 is maamle main bijepi (BJP) lagaataar congress ko gher rahi he
 Now Congress President Rahul Gandhi has issued a statement on this issue
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki sam pitroda ne jo kaha vah puri tarah 'out of line' he or unhen iske liye maafee maangani chahie

 Two smart officers of the Sindh Police came to meet him at the VVIP lounge at the International Airport

 The historic elections are going to be held on 11 May in Pakistan

 Bulletproof glass is becoming a common thing

 On 29 March, a lawyer in Karachi High Court expressed his anger by throwing a shoe at him
 vah juuta musharraf ko nahin laga, lekin yah unke liye aane vaale khatre kaa sanket tha
 Intelligence agencies such as ISI, Military Intelligence and Intelligence Bureau have warned that terrorist organizations are planning to destroy the upcoming election

 'imran Khan is the only leader who does not care about security threats

 'nearly six years ago, when former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto returned to Pakistan, he too ignored the security instructions

 Zardari's PPP won a landslide victory in these elections

 On the day Benazir was killed, Sharif also narrowly survived an attack

 There was no injury to Sharif, but four of his supporters riding on the vehicle behind him were killed

 The security environment for leaders there has deteriorated rapidly
 haalanki suraksha agenciyon ne netaaon ke liye suraksha ke pukhta bandobast kar rakhe hai, par ummidavaar kisi tarah kaa jokhim nahin uthaa rahe hai
 The Election Commission allows the expenditure of 15 lakh Pakistani rupees for campaigning, but the candidates contesting for the National Assembly are spending between 50 and 70 lakh rupees on one seat

 Who will become the Chief Minister of Karnataka, this will be revealed in a few hours
 congress kii ore siddharmaiya or bijepi kii ore se bies yediurppa mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar hai
 Apart from these 2 names, there are 3 more names which are in the queue of CM
 dilli se lekar bengalooru tak ke siyaasi galiyaaron main charchaa he ki kisi bhi dal ko spasht bahumat nahin milane kii surat main in 3 naamon main se kisi 1 ke sir mukhyamantri kaa taj saj saktaa he
 bjp's CM candidate BS yeddyurappabs Yeddyurappa is the chief ministerial candidate in the case of BJP getting majority
 karnataka main bijepi se varisht netaa pehle se hi bijepi kii ore se ghoshit mukhyamantri ummidavaar hai
 Yeddyurappa is also confident of his victory
 isi ke chalate ve matdaan se kuch samay pehle tak apni jeet ko lekar aashwast najar aa rahe the
 Just a day before the counting of votes, he claimed that he was winning
 unhone to yahaan tak daawa kiya he ki ve 15 may ko shaam ko piem modi se milane dilli ja rahe hai
 Siddaramaiah's strong prospects If the Congress gets a majority in the election, Siddaramaiah is the most powerful contender for the post of Chief Minister
 karnataka main congress ko purna bahumat milane par siddharmaiya kii naa sirf karnataka balki rashtriya str par bhi dhak badhegi
 In such a situation, his stature would emerge as the third largest leader in the Congress after Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi
 karnataka main congress ko bahumat miltaa he to ye rahul gandhi ke party netritv par bhi ek tarah se muhar lagane ke samaan hoga
 This is the first assembly election after Rahul Gandhi became Congress President and if he gets a spectacular victory, then even his leadership skills will not be ignored by the opponents at the national level
 congress ko bahumat nahin mila to
 
 
 If the Congress emerges as the single largest party in the counting of votes, but stays away from a majority, then the chances of Siddaramaiah becoming the Chief Minister again will come as a shock
 JDS siddharmaiya ke netritv vaali congress ko samarthan dene ke liye taiyaar nahin hogi
 Siddaramaiah is also seen ready to give up the Chief Minister's claim for a Dalit face
 aise main party main dalit chehre ke rup main sabase majbootee se mallikarjun khadge or karnataka pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh ji parameshwar kaa naam saamne aata he
 Mallikarjun Kharge, the leading leader in the Dalit face, was running the name of Congress as the Chief Minister in 2013 as well, but at that time Siddaramaiah had won
 agar badale halaat main khadge ko siem banaakar bhejnaa padaa, to rahul khud loksabhaa main party kaa netaa pad sambhaal sakate hai
 Kharge comes from Bidar Assembly of Karnataka
 centre kii raajnneeti kaa lanbaa anubhav hone ke saath-saath ve karnataka congress ke adhyaksh bhi rah chuke hai
 Karnataka Pradesh President g Parameshwara is also the second face in the line after Kharge, Karnataka Pradesh Congress President g Parameshwar as Kharge
 2013 main congress ko mili vijay main ji parameshwar kii ahm bhoomika rahi thi
 However, he himself could not save his seat and lost the election
 isaki vajah se ve us samay bhi siem pad kii daud main peeche rah gaye the
 But this time if the Dalit face is discovered, then this time also he remains strong in the race
 kumaraswami kii bhi sambhaavnaayengedies ke paas satta kii chaabi he
 In such a situation, the chances of Kumaraswamy of JDS becoming Chief Minister also cannot be denied
 ye sambhaavna isliye bhi balwati hoti he kyonki congress kisi bhi surat main bhaajapa ko satta sambhalate nahin dekhnaa chaahegi
 In such a situation, the Congress can support the JDS from outside and Kumar Swamy can sit on the Chief Minister's chair
 kumaraswami ko 2019 main mahagathbandhan hone par bhi kuch phayda ho saktaa he

 On the other hand, Shatrughan Sinha has also gone against this decision and supported the AAP party by going against the party line
 unhone twit karte hue likhaa, " 'aap' aae, 'aap' chhaae, 'aap' hi 'aap' charchaa main vichhaae
 At home, in every news, what about 'you'? Politics of interests does not work much
 chintaa mat kariye, khush rahiye!" unhone ek or twit main kaha ki ummid he or prarthana karte hai ki aapako jald hi nyaay milegaa

 'notebandi or jiesti ke khilaaf sinhayah pehla mauka nahin he jab sinha bhaajapa ke do kaddavar sinha ne partline ke vipareet jaakar logon ko chaunkaaya he
 Former finance and foreign minister Yashwant Sinha has been fiercely attacking the government's bold decisions against demonetisation and GST
 unhone narendra modi sarkaar kii aarthik nitiyon kii kai maukon par khulkar aalochana kii or 'rajshakti' par niyantran ke liye 'lokshakti' kii jarurat bataai
 Apart from this, Yashwant lashed out at the party for creating disproportionate assets of Jayant Shah, son of party chief Amit Shah
 is par unhone kaha tha, aisa lagata he ki party ne itane varshon main arjeet apane ucch naitik aadhaar kho diya
 Yashwant Sinha did not stop here and he continued his rebellion against the party
 kuch din pehle unhone ek kaarykram main kaha tha ki aaj kii bhaajapa vah bhaajapa nahin rah gai he jo atal bihari vaajapeyi or laal krishna adwani ke vakt thi
 Like Modi's minister 'chalukus' Yashwant, Shatrughan Sinha is also raising the flag against the party
 aap ke vidhayakon kii sadsyta jane par party kii aalochana kii
 He has been against the party many times before
 abhinayta se netaa bane shatrughna sinha ne ek baar kaha tha, agar bhaajapa 'van-main sho or tu-main army' se bachati he to hi vah logon kii ummiido par khari utar paaegi
 He has also been very critical of demonetisation and GST
 saath hi modi ke kareebi or vitt mantri arun jetali ko lagaataar apana nishaanaa banaaya he
 On demonetisation, he said that all the problems were caused by demonetisation, factories were closed, production fell, unemployment increased
 trahimam kii sthiti ban gai
 Not only him, a lot of people felt and he cannot say it in secret
 saath hi unhone bhrashtachar par pradhanmantri modi ke 'kathan na khaauungaa na khaane duungaa' kii nakal karte hue kaha ki maujuuda samay yah 'na jiunga na jeene duungaa' ban gaya he
 He alleged in November last year that 90 per cent of Modi's ministers were sycophantic and no one knew him
 haalanki yah bhi dilachasp he ki party ke sheersh str par in donon netaaon ke bagawati rukh ke dekhte hue kuch bhi nahin kaha gaya
 The party is also not taking any action against him
 pichley kuch maheenon main yashavanth sinha jis tarah se bagawati rukh banaae hue hai us tarah se unhen party kii ore se kadaa dand mil saktaa tha, lekin party alaakaman is maamle main chuppa saadhe hue he, yahi haal 'shotgan' shatrughan sinha ke saath bhi he
 Perhaps both were hoping that they would get 'something' in Modiraj, but their hopes remained unfulfilled, while the party did not want to remain silent on these two and show that the new leadership could not keep the old veterans with them

 film bie paas ke trailor par na jaaen
 This is not an intoxicating type of lousy film, in which c grades were discovered on the pretext of showing sex between a youngster and a woman Omar
 haalanki film ram jane kyon vaise pramot kii ja rahi he
 This film is the first story of a boy's helplessness and struggle
 bahanon ke liye, apane liye, achche vakt ke liye, wo anjaane main purush veshya ban jaataa he
 It starts with an aunt of her aunt

 Option two fixed
 richa chadda or shilpa shukla
 There was a doubt with Shilpa that her Chak De India image was still being carried

 Tughlaq speaking, opening chains or revolting
 bie paas ko bhi sabase zyada ghaney rang unhone hi bakhshae
 It is not the role of one-sided rascal woman
 isamen kuch pyaase, kuch samajhadaari ke or kuch khiz ke shades bhi the
 Shilpa gave it new recognition with her voice, ups and downs and pauses and body language
 unhone apane liye bhi acting kaa paimaana phir ooncha kar liya
 Congratulations on accepting and playing the role with this erotic look but depth
 5 nibhaa le gaye shadabahfilm main mukesh ke chehre par akasar nirih bhav, kabhi kuch umang or kabhi kuch badppan dikhnaa tha

 7 Many more organs have grown on the skeleton of an anecdote: Bea Pass is not just the story of Mukesh getting trapped in Sarika's web
 isamen din or raat ke parde ke peeche chhipi dilli he
 There are standing potters lying on the roadside till the morning burst
 kholi main rangeen postcard ke sahare sapanom ko taange kuch ghinhe se dikhte log hai
 There is a fight between Kasparov and Corpov
 kiti party ke sahare bos kii good book main aane kii jugat he
 There is a woman, who is played by Deepti Naval, spent in the solitude of trouble
 chota sa role, magar hameshaa ke liye yaad rah jaae
 There are some sisters who want to escape from the clutches of Vorden
 ek bhai he jo aakhri daud daud rahaa he phone kii ghantiyon or syran ke bich
 8 shows a bold plot without being obscene Director Bahl Ne: The director of the film has worn this hat for the first time

 Like i said earlier the film is bold

 To show the tone of the face when the camera comes closer

 But these scenes do not stick on the face

 And this is a very important success in terms of Hindi films
 isi tarah film kii edieting kii baat karen to first half main ek baar lag saktaa he ki thik he bhai samaj gaya ki mukesh isamen ulajh gaya
 How much will you draw now? magar second half main film jo raftaar pakadati he to sidhe ant par hi sud bakhshati he aasapaas kii
 The camera work and location reminds of Anurag Kashyap's cinema
 aawaargi main jhumata camera or ghisi pity ames fliover jaisi dikhti nai dilli se dur, asal-nai sarai rohilla numa puraani dilli kii loketions
 These are some of the more strong sides of the film
 10 or ant main prarthanahbada filmkaar wo nahin hota jo tay vakt main kuch kirdaaron se apni baat kah de
 The big filmmaker is the one who can put those characters in your mind at that time
 kehane ko film parde par khatm ho jaae
 But when you return, the characters also return together
 kuch sawaal bhi launte, jinke jawaab aap gadhate rahen ki acha phir iskaa kya hua
 It could have happened the same way
 agar main hota to yun karata
 Some characters continue to pray that i wish something was okay with him
 ye adhuuraapan nahin nae chalan kii kissagoi kii kamyaabi he
 When the film ends, something ends, but something begins
 parde par sab kuch dikhataa nahin he
 That is why it remains in the mind

 Modi, who faced criticism for the killing of Muslims in the 2002 riots in Gujarat after the Godhra carnage, did not even mention this controversial issue in his nearly half-hour-long speech
 modi ne kaha, dharmanirpekshata kii meri paribhaasha kaaphi saadhaaran he, ‘pehle bharat’
 Whatever you do, wherever you work, India should be the top priority for all its citizens
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne kaha, desh sabhi dharmon evam vichaardhaaraon se upar he
 He said that people should follow this principle
 modi ne kaha, main isse sahamat hum mitron ki ek bhartiya ke taur par, bharat se prem karne vaale ek naagarik ke taur par, aap bhi meri is paribhaasha se sahamat honge

 It is not necessary to always invest in India or send dollars, motivating people to come to India is another way of service
 tivi asia ke siio echaar shah ne daawa kiya ki duniyabar main modi ke is bhaashan ko lakhon logon ne ‘live’ dekha
 Modi said, my definition of secularism is quite simple, 'first India'
 aap jo bhi karen, jahaan kahin bhi kaam karen, iske sabhi nagarikon ke liye bharat hi sarvocch praathamikta honi chahie

 The Kejriwal government, which talked of conspiracy to fail the odd-even formula, has now taken a U-turn on this issue
 sarkaar ne is pahalu kii jaanch ke liye teen sadasyon kii cameti gathit kii, jisaki report main sajeesh kii koi bhi baat nikal kar saamne nahin ai
 However, the Delhi government is also giving the fire service figures, according to which the incidence of fire has been claimed to increase threefold after the implementation of aud-even
 report main nahin nikali sajizdilli ke alag-alag hisson main aag kisne lagaai? kya ye sirphod-evanako fail karne kii sajeesh he? dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar kam se kam kuch dinon pehle tak to yahi kah rahi thi or is theory kii jaanch ke liye sarkaar ne aanan-fanan main teen sadasyon kii cameti bhi bana di
 In this way, the committee had to report within three days, but it took about seven days
 jab report ai, to maamla khoda pahaad nikali chuhia vaala niklaa
 The transport minister, who was talking about the conspiracy a week ago, changed the tone after the report came
 aag ke peeche emsididilli sarkaar kii cameti ne aath pej kii report guuruuvaar ko saunpi
 Much of the report refers to the fire in the garbage dump
 vahaan bhi sarkaar kii report sajeesh kii bajaae aag se nipatane ke upaay or vahaan lagi aag kii sambhavit vajahon par hi baat karti najar ai, jisamen nikammepan kaa thikra bijepi shasit nagar nigam par phoda gaya
 Fire cases increased this year, but the funny thing is that the government told about more cases during aud-even in Delhi than last year, but did not say that the number of fire cases in general increased in April this year
 yani ek april se 14 april yani od-ivan lagu hone se pehle aag lagane ke maamle lagbhag usee anupaat main bade jitna od-ivan ke dauraan

 karnataka main jari siyaasi ghamaasan ke bich congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko hatyaropee kahkar vivaad paidaa kar diya he
 With the resignation of Chief Minister of BS Yeddyurappa, Gadgad Rahul Gandhi held a press conference and attacked BJP President Amit Shah and PM Modi fiercely
 is dauraan unhone bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko hatyaropee qaraar diya
 This has once again created political controversy
 isse pehle pakistan ke khilaaf sargical strike ke baadaraahul gandhi piem modi par vivaadit bayaan diya tha
 He had said that PM Modi is touting the blood of the martyrs
 rahul gandhi aresas ko mahatma gandhi kaa hatyara bhi bataa chuke hai
 Apart from this, during the Gujarat assembly elections of 2007, the then Congress President Sonia Gandhi called the then Chief Minister of Gujarat (now Prime Minister) a merchant of death, which caused a lot of ruckus
 gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri modi ne isaki shikaayat bhi chunaav ayog se kii thi
 However, the Congress had to face defeat in this election
 saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue sonia gandhi ne kaha tha ki bijepi satta kii bhukh main jehar kii kheti kar rahi he
 In this election too, the Congress faced a severe defeat
 ab karnataka chunaav ke baad maujuuda congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne amit shah ko hatyaropee kahkar vivaad paidaa kar diya he
 However, so far no comment has been received from the BJP
 shanivaar ko yediurppa ke istife ke baad rahul gandhi ne press conference main kaha, ''mujhe garv he ki karnataka kii janata ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh va hatyaropee amit shah ko dikhaa diya ki ve loktantr ko paise se kharid nahin sakate hai
 Rahul Gandhi said that the BJP MLA and Speaker got out of the House before the national anthem was played in the Karnataka Assembly
 ye unka swabhaav he ki ve hindustan ke kisi bhi santhaan kii izzat nahin karte hai
 BJP and Sangh have been doing this again and again in the past
 panchayat ajtak main congress netaa digvijay singh ne modi sarkaar ke chaar saal ke kaaryon par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 He said that Modi government did not do any work on corruption
 saath hi unhone bijepi netaa or kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar ko chunauti di or kaha ki blikemani par jethmalani or jetali kaa bahes kara den, sabakuch saaf ho jayega
 He said that the Modi government fought the fight for corruption so much that it did not allow it to become a Lokayukta in Gujarat
 chaar saal main lokapal kaa gathan nahin kiya
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has only one agenda, fool Hindus in the name of Hindu Muslims and take votes from them
 digvijay ne centre sarkaar par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki piem modi ne kaha tha ki notebandi se bhrashtachar khatm ho jayega, aatank kii qamar tut jaaegi, kalaadhan samaapt ho jayega, phek karency khatm ho jaaegi
 But nothing prepared for it, as a result 15 lakh people lost their jobs
 do fisadi jidipi neeche chalaa gaya, saath hi bainkon ne bhi baari bhrashtachar kiya
 Such was the government's preparation that after demonetisation, 66 orders were taken out in 50 days
 panchayat ajtak main unhone bijepi netaa prakaash jaavdekar ko chunauti dete hue kaha ki aap kalaadhan par ram jethmalani or arun jetali kaa bahes kara den, sabakuch saaf ho jayega
 The government had said that so much black money will come into the country that Rs 15 lakh will be deposited in the account of each person

 In view of their importance in campaigning, the number of their rallies has also been increased
 piem modi bhi chunavi maahaul ko bijepi ke paksh main karne main koi kor kasar nahin chhod rahe hai
 PM Modi is often seen at the end of his election rallies in Kannada saying 'sarkar Badlisi, BJP Galisi'
 iskaa matlab hota he- 'sarkaar badalo, bijepi ko le aao'
 Modi's speaking in Kannada is seen as an attempt to woo the local voters
 guuruuvaar ko unhone gulberga or bellari main kannada main hi apane bhaashanon kii shuruyaat kii
 During this time he remembered Lord Basaveshwara
 bellari main unhone kannada bhashaa main hi congress ke siem pad ke ummidavaar siddharmaiya par bhi hamalaa bolaa
 In Bellary, Modi said that the Congress has tried its best to discredit Bellary
 desh or duniya main bellari ko galat tareeke se prachaarit kiya ja rahaa he, jaise ki yahaan par koi chor or lutere rahete hai
 Let us tell you that the Prime Minister started his speech in Kannada language only
 unhone kaha ki karnataka main sidhaa-rupaya sarkaar he, is rupaya sarkaar ne karnataka ko karj ke boj main dubaa diya he
 Siddaramaiah has trained, Siddaramaiah has targeted Modi for speaking in Kannada
 do din pehle siddharmaiya ne kaha tha ki modi galat kannada bolte hai
 He also said that he spoke in Kannada at Modi's Chamarajanagar rally
 unki raily main marathi kaaphi sankhya main the, is lihaaj se unhen marathi main bolnaa chahie tha
 Modi has already given the slogan of 'chalo Paltay' even in Tripura
 iskaa matlab hota he, aaie badlaav karen
 This is not the first time that PM Modi has used the local language during the election campaign
 isse pehle wo bihar main bhojpuri or assam main vahaan kii sthaneey bhashaa main bhaashan de chuke hai

 punjab sarkaar ke shiksha vibhaag ke do afasaron kii vajah se punjab sarkaar or sarkaar ke shiksha vibhaag kii kaaphi kirakiri hui
 In fact, two deputy directors of the education department on Monday issued a circular stating that women teachers of government schools in Punjab should pay special attention to their attire while teaching students in the school and school teachers should get their clothes and jeans Instructions not to wear T-shirts were also given in this circular
 is circular ke jari hone ke saath hi circular ke andar die gaye nirdeshon ko lekar shiksha mahakme main hi isaki ninda honi shuru ho gai
 After this, the Punjab government withdrew the circular within 24 hours in view of its misery and both the deputy directors who issued the circular were suspended
 punjab kii shiksha mantri aruna choudharine kaha ki unki taraf se yaa sarkaar kii taraf se is tarah kaa koi bhi dishanirdesh yaa dress code teachers ke liye jari nahin kiya gaya he
 The two officers issued this dress code decree for women teachers without consulting the government and the education minister
 isi vajah se donon dipti diarector ko turant prabhaav se suspend kar diya gaya he or ye dress code lagu karne kaa circular bhi waapas le liya gaya
 Keeping this in mind, the female teacher, who teaches in Punjab schools, is not saying anything openly
 lekin, unhone kaha ki wo pehle hi skulon main aane ke dauraan apni dress or paridhaan kaa behad hi dhyaan rakhti hai or shaayad hi koi aisi teacher hogi joki skulon main bhadkile kapade pahan kar aati ho
 The teachers said that even if the government issues an order regarding the dress code, they will welcome it and come to schools wearing clothes accordingly
 shiksha vibhagaki taraf se 2012 main teachers ke liye dress code lagu karne ke nirdesh kaa hawala dete hue ek baar phir 8 may 2017 ko shiksha vibhaag ke dipti diarector ne ye aadesh jari kar die hai
 It has also been said in the circular that complaints about teachers coming in schools wearing garish clothes can be read directly in this circular
 philhal is circular ko lekar ho rahi punjab sarkaar kii ninda or hangaame kii vajah se shiksha vibhaag ne is aadesh ko waapas le liya he or ye aadesh jari karne vaale donon dipti diarector ko bhi suspend kar diya gaya he
 The Shunglu committee has drawn the sacked head of the Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee, Suresh Kalmadi and his colleagues, saying that there had been too much centralization of power at the top and there was a conflict of interest between the committee officials

 The committee, which investigated corruption and irregularities in the Commonwealth Games event, said the organizing committee was beset by governance problems due to the massive 500-member general assembly and flattery in the executive board
 samiti ne apni report main kaha he, ‘aayojan samiti adhyaksh kaa paryaay thi
 The decision-making process with excessive centralization of power at the top was limited in the hands of the chairman and his loyal senior management troupe

 kisi bhi asantosh ko bardaasht nahin kiya jaataa tha
 The panel said, 'many senior positions were appointed for persons whose loyalty was doubtful and against whom there had been vigilance cases in the past

 ’ samiti ne tikat, sponcership, laagat, timming, scoring, parinaam, khan paan or bhartee se sambandhit pariyojnaon main baari aniyamitaayen evam rajasav haani pai
 The committee found the three contracts awarded to a company called Event Knowledge Services for the development of the sports venue to be dubious and recommended a probe by the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate into the flow of funds of the organizing committee to this Mauritius company

 Action in Sonia Vihar: The East MCD team has also sealed illegal meat shops in Sonia Vihar area
 buudhvaar ko east emsidi kii team ne sonia vihaar main avaidh rup se chal rahi maance kii 10 dukaanon ko sil kiya tha
 The corporation's team also faced mild opposition but action was carried out in the presence of police force
 trilokapuri main hua hamalaado din pehle jab east emsidi kii team purvi dilli ke trilokapuri ilaake menmance kii avaidh dukanonke khilaaf karrwai karne gai thi to team par maance dukaan chalaane waalon ne hamalaa kar diya tha
 During this time one of the corporators also suffered a head injury

 Recently, the government's attempt to abolish the collegium system for appointment of judges in the Supreme Court had failed
 aagaamee raashtrapati chunaav nirvirodh karaane kii pahal kii gai he
 NCP chief Sharad Pawar is leading the opposition for this initiative
 maharashtra ke sholapur main naagarik sammaan kaa jawaab dete hue sharad pavaar ne kaha ki agar pradhanmantri vipaksh se baat karen to raashtrapati chunaav nirvirodh karaayaa ja saktaa he
 Pawar also said that the NDA has the necessary support
 is bich sarvasammati ke dhaage ko pakadakar shivasena ne sharad pavaar ko hi sarvasammat ummidavaar ke rup main pesh kiya he
 Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut has told NDTV India that BJP should support Sharad Pawar if there is a consensus on Sharad Pawar's name for the presidency
 raashtrapati chunaav ko sarvasammati se nirvirodh karaane kii pahal hoti dekh shivasena sharad pavaar kii ummidavaari main apana yogadan dekh rahi he
 Sharad Pawar is a name for her on the pretext that she will be able to run her original agenda
 shivasena ko philhal sharad pavaar raashtrapati chunaav ke liye sabase kaabil ummidavaar najar aa rahe hai
 Raut has said that power is capable and can also become capable president
 gauratlab he ki shivasena party pramukh uddhav thakare ne haalia endie kii baithak main shirkat kar bijepi ke ummidavaar ko samarthan kaa elaan kiya he
 But in the meantime, Shiv Sena's mind seems shocked by the name of Sharad Pawar from the Left leader Sitaram Yechury
 haalanki shivasena netaa sanjay raut yaad dilaa rahe hai ki party kii pehali pasand maujuuda sthiti main ab bhi aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat hi hai
 The comments haalanki khud sharad pavaar ne raashtrapati pad kii daud se khud ko saarvajanik rup se dur rakhaa he or unki party bhi is baat ko doharaa rahi he
 But by offering to make the election uncontested, they do not want to let their importance diminish in this game
 isliye sharad pavaar ne yaad dilaayaa he ki raashtrapati pad kaa chunaav aisa nahin ki use ladakar hi nateeja hasil ho
 The Presidential election will be a crook for the NDA and opposition parties
 aise main yah bhi dekhnaa rochak hoga ki kya congress raashtrapati chunaav main sharad pavaar ke peeche puri takat lagaaegi? Meanwhile, by holding the thread of consensus, Shiv Sena has introduced Sharad Pawar as the unanimous candidate
 shivasena netaa or rajyasabha sadsy sanjay raut ne enditivi india se baatcheet main kaha he ki raashtrapati pad ke liye sharad pavaar ke naam par sarvasammati ban jaae to bijepi ko bhi sharad pavaar ko samarthan dena chahie
 The Shiv Sena is seeing its contribution to Sharad Pawar's candidature as the initiative to unanimously unselect the presidential election
 uske liye sharad pavaar ek aisa naam he jis bahaane vah apana mul agenda chalaa paaegi
 The Shiv Sena is currently seen as the most capable candidate for the presidential election of Sharad Pawar
 raut ne kaha he ki power kaabil hai or kaabil raashtrapati bhi ban sakate hai
 Significantly, Shiv Sena party chief Uddhav Thackeray has announced his support for the BJP candidate by attending the recent NDA meeting
 lekin is bich vampanthi netaa seetaram yechuri kii taraf se sharad pavaar kaa naam vikalp ke rup main lene se shivasena kaa man dol gaya lagata he
 However, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut is reminding that the party's first choice is still RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat in the current situation
 tippaniyan However, Sharad Pawar himself has publicly kept himself away from the presidential race and his party is also repeating this
 lekin chunaav nirvirodh karaane kii peshkash karke is khel main ve apni ahmiyat kam nahin hone dena chaahate
 Therefore, Sharad Pawar has reminded that the election of the President is not such that he can get the result only by fighting
 raashtrapati chunaav endie or vipakshi dalon ke liye philhal tedi kheer hogi
 In such a situation, it will also be interesting to see if the Congress will put full force behind Sharad Pawar in the presidential election? raashtrapati chunaav ko sarvasammati se nirvirodh karaane kii pahal hoti dekh shivasena sharad pavaar kii ummidavaari main apana yogadan dekh rahi he
 Sharad Pawar is a name for her on the pretext that she will be able to run her original agenda
 shivasena ko philhal sharad pavaar raashtrapati chunaav ke liye sabase kaabil ummidavaar najar aa rahe hai
 Raut has said that power is capable and can also become capable president
 gauratlab he ki shivasena party pramukh uddhav thakare ne haalia endie kii baithak main shirkat kar bijepi ke ummidavaar ko samarthan kaa elaan kiya he
 But in the meantime, Shiv Sena's mind seems shocked by the name of Sharad Pawar from the Left leader Sitaram Yechury
 haalanki shivasena netaa sanjay raut yaad dilaa rahe hai ki party kii pehali pasand maujuuda sthiti main ab bhi aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat hi hai
 The comments haalanki khud sharad pavaar ne raashtrapati pad kii daud se khud ko saarvajanik rup se dur rakhaa he or unki party bhi is baat ko doharaa rahi he
 But by offering to make the election uncontested, they do not want to let their importance diminish in this game
 isliye sharad pavaar ne yaad dilaayaa he ki raashtrapati pad kaa chunaav aisa nahin ki use ladakar hi nateeja hasil ho

 In fact, Rahul Gandhi has announced a "justice scheme" through which around 5 crore families of the country will be guaranteed a minimum income by helping Rs 72,000 every year
 ek anumaan ke mutabik rahul gandhi kii is yojana par 3
 6 lakh crore rupees
 yah rakam bahut badi he, isse kai badi samasyaon kaa samaadhaan nikal saktaa he
 Let us tell you today what can be done in India with this amount or what problems could have been overcome

 Had it been 6 lakh crores, the farmers would get 30 thousand rupees
 The Modi government announced the PM Kisan Yojana in the interim budget
 piem kisaan yojana ke liye bajet main 75000 karod kii raashi sweekrut kii gai he
 Under this scheme, 12 crore small and marginal farmers of the country are being given 6 thousand rupees annually in 3 installments
 agar rahul gandhi kii nyaay skim ke 3
 Compared to the estimated budget of 6 lakh crore rupees, PM Kisan is 5 times more than the budget of the scheme
 aise main kaha ja saktaa he ki 12 karod kisaanon ko salanaa 6 hajaar ke mukaable 5 guna zyada 30 hajaar rupee mil sakate hai
 3
 6 lakh karod hota to japan se karj kii nahin hoti jaruratsaal 2022 se pehle japan kii madad se mumbai se ahmedabad ke bich desh kii pehali bullate train chalegi
 This train will cover the distance of 508 km in 3 hours
 bullate train ke is project kii kul laagat 1
 10 lakh crores
 agar rahul gandhi kii nyaay skim kii 3
 When compared to the estimated budget of 6 lakh crore rupees, with this amount, the Government of India can expand the project of bullet train on 3 lines near a distance of 500 km
 iske saath hi bharat sarkaar ko japan se karj lene kii jarurat bhi nahin padegi
 Please tell that a loan of 88 thousand crore rupees has been taken
 yah karj 0
 Interest rate of 1%, which will have to be repaid in 50 years

 6 lakh crores would have ended the rbi-government dispute
 Last year, the dispute between Reserve Bank of India and Government of India made a lot of headlines
 is puure vivaad kii ek bahut badi vajah 3
 The amount of Rs 6 lakh crore was stated
 darasal, media report main yah daawa kiya gaya ki sarkaar 3
 There is a demand of 6 lakh crore fund which is not in favor of RBI
 rahul gandhi ke nyaay skim kii anumaanit bajet bhi 3
 6 lakh crores

 6 lakh crores, then the old pension to the paramilitary forces, for the last several years, there has been a demand for giving pension under the old pension scheme to the paramilitary forces across the country
 isko lekar deshbhar ke ardhsainik balon se jude sanghathan samay-samay par pradarshan karte rahete hai
 If we compare Rahul Gandhi's justice scheme budget then the old pension scheme may be applicable for the paramilitary forces of the country
 bataa den ki saal 2017-18 ke dauraan pension dene par kul 1,56,641
 29 crores has been spent
 iske alaava rahul gandhi kii skim kii madad se ritaryat sena ke liye di jane vaali van rank, van pension (oropi) yojana ke bajet ko bhi badhaayaa ja saktaa he kyonki van rank, van pension ke tahat sarkaar ne ab tak ritred sainikon ko 35 hajaar karod rupee die gaye hai
 3
 6 lakh karod hota to doguna ho jaataa dephence bajatpakistan or china se tanaav ke halaat main bhi vartmaan main bharat dephence sector par 3 lakh karod rupee kharch kar rahaa he
 If the estimated budget of the justice scheme of Rahul Gandhi is allocated, then the budget of the defense sector can be doubled
 iske saath hi bharat raksha kshetra main adhik majboot ho jayega
 Let us tell that America has 36 percent of the amount spent on defense budget by countries around the world while China has 13 percent
 vartmaan main bharat se aage america, china, rus or saudi arab hai

 This is to say of the farmers of the sleepy village of Jaipur
 kya bujurg, kya jawan or kya mahilaayein, beete 4 dinon se is gaanv ke kisaan jameen samadhi liye baithe hai
 Their entire body is inside the pits for the land samadhi, only the head is outside the head
 kisaanon ne jameen bachaane ke liye apni tarah kaa ye anoothaa andolan gandhi jayanti (2 oktober) se shuru kiya
 In fact, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has issued notices to the farmers of this village to vacate the land
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki kareeb 1350 bigha jameen 2010 main hi colony banane ke liye adhigrihith kii ja chuki he
 At the same time, the farmers say that the government wants to sell their land at high prices and settle the colony
 sarkaar ne jameen kaa muaavja nahin lene vaale kisaanon kaa muaavja court main jamaakar bedakhli kii prakriya shuru kar di he
 The government says that farmers should take compensation deposited in the court and vacate the land
 muaavje kii baat par kisaan kehete hai ki har kisaan kii thodi-thodi jameen unke khud ke rahane ke liye he, use kaise sarkaar unase le sakati he
 According to the farmers, it is better to give their lives by living in the land themselves
 kisaanon ke is andolan ko dekhte hue sarkaar baikfoot par he
 Farmers are being asked by the government to come forward for talks
 vahiin kisaanon kaa kahana he ki baatcheet kaa sawaal hi nahin he
 If the government really wants the interest of the farmers, then declare not to take their land
 aisa nahin hota to kisaan gaddhon main hi gadhe rah kar apni jaan de denge lekin apni jameen nahin jane denge
 Please tell that Jaipur Development Authority of Rajasthan Government is also in the grip of recession
 property kaa bazaar band hua to vikaas kaa kaam thap ho gaya
 For this, if the money is needed, it was planned to take the land of the farmers by cutting the plot
 lekin jedie ke is kadam ke khilaaf neendad ke kisaan puri takat ke saath dat gaye hai
 Jeevat Ram of the sleepers
 kareeb 78 saal ke ho gaye hai lekin umr ke is padaav par apnijameen bachaneke liye gadde main baithe hai
 He has two grandchildren, and nine grandchildren, a son with disabilities
 jeevat ram kaa kahana he ki isi jameen main wo paley bade, isse alag hone kii wo soch bhi nahin sakate
 Will die on this but will not let it fall apart
 isi tarah 80 saal kii dhapu kii ankhon main jameen kii baat karte-karte aansu aa jate hai
 Significantly, the government had planned to build a colony on the farmers' land in 2010 itself, but now they have given notices to the farmers to surrender the land
 isi ke virodh main jaipur sikar haive se satee jameen par kisaan ye virodh pradarshan kar rahe hai
 There is so much anger among the farmers that the road built under the colony's plan was also uprooted
 is par sarkaar ne mukadmaa karne kii dhamkee bhi di he

 The name of that star is Vijender Singh
 vahi boxravijender singh, jo din dinon drugs taskari scandle se jude hone ke aaropon se ghira hua he
 Vijender Singh created a panic by knocking the medal in the 2008 Olympics
 tab yah gaanv (kaluwas) surkhiyon main aayaa
 Vijender Singh also achieved the dream he had brought to show something bigger
 lekin in dinonshili dawaaon kii taskarike aropiyon se vijender kaa link hone kii baat ne unki chhavi ko kaaphi kharaab kiya he
 Mail Today visited Kaluvas village on Tuesday
 yahaan sab kuch vaisaa hi tha, jaisaa aksar hota tha
 While the young men of the village were playing cards, the chaupal of the elders was also frozen in the same way as it is in normal days
 rosemara ke kaam bhi jari the
 His mother was standing outside Vijender's magnificent house
 mail today ne unase baat kerani chaahi to ve kaaphi jhijakin
 After some time she agreed to talk
 ve yah bataane ko raji ho gayi ki pichley kuch dinon main un par or unke parivaar par kya biit rahi he
 Boxing Vijender Singh's mother Krishna Devi, while fully supporting her son, said that the family is facing a lot of mental trouble these days
 drugs vivaad ne na keval vijender kii, balki puure parivaar unki chhavi kharaab kii he
 Krishna Devi told, 'though the people of the village respect the family a lot and they are with us from the heart, yet they are starting to get out of the house a bit strange now
 hamen vishwaas he ki vijender galat nahin he, lekin phir bhi parivaar ke sadsy hone ke naate logon ke saamne man par ek boj bana hi rahata he
 Vijender's name cropped up in the drugs smuggling controversy when his wife's name was found outside the flat of registered car NRI Anoop Singh Kahlon, who is the main accused of smuggling drugs, and also found a significant amount of heroin
 kahlon kii giraftaar ho chuki he
 Troubles for Vijender escalated when his friend Ram Singh said that the two (ram Singh and Vijender) had taken heroin together
 punjab police ne is maamle main vijender se uske khun or baalo ke sample maange, lekin vijender se isse inkaar kar diya tha
 Krishna Devi is confident that it will take some time, but her son Pak will come out clean
 unki maa ne kaha, vijender ko fansaaya banaaya ja rahaa he, kyonki vah ek star he or uski chhavi behad saaf he
 Hopefully, he will prove his innocence soon
 vijender singh kaa naam drugs taskaron se judane kii khabar ne prashansakon ke saath-saath unke gaanv ke logon ko bhi jhatka diya
 Subhash Singh, a resident of Kaluvas village, told that we were shocked by that news about Vijender
 hamane vijender yaa uske parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko kabhi smoking karte nahin dekha, drugs kii baat to dur
 Vijender of such a big player and clear image will take drugs, it is beyond our thinking
 ek anya gaanvvasi hajaari singh ne kaha ki ek dashak se vah acha khel dikhaa rahaa he or uskaa is vivaad main ulajhna durbhagyapurna he
 He has been in the national team for so long, if he had been doping, he would have been caught
 haalanki kuch logon ne dabi aawaaj main kaha ki chaahe jo bhi he, vijender ko apni nirdoshita sabit kerani hi hogi
 a villager said on the condition of anonymity that we know that Vijender is a very respectable person
 vah gaanv main har vyakti kaa aadar karata he
 But we cannot determine his image on this basis
 gaanv ke baahar bhi uski jindagi he
 If he is innocent then he should come out and prove it
 maharashtra main sarkaar gathan ko lekar 18 din tak chale khinchataan ke baad mangalvaar ko raashtrapati shashan lagu kar diya gaya
 After BJP and Shiv Sena, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari had invited NCP to form the government, but before that President's rule was imposed in the state
 grih mantralay ke adhikariyon ke mutabik, ensipi ne mangalvaar subah rajyapal se sampark kiya tha or sarkaar banane ke liye 3 din kaa samay maanga tha

 NCP said-3 more daysraj Bhavan had asked the NCP to mobilize support to form the government by 8:30 pm on Tuesday evening and asked to give the letter
 usase pehle hi ensipi ne aakhir kyon din main hi rajbhavan jaakar yah kah diya ki use 3 din kaa samay chahie
 Home Ministry sources have informed that NCP gave such a letter to Raj Bhavan
 uske baad maharashtra ke governor ne apni puri report banaate hue centre sarkaar ko bheji
 The Central Government then convened a Cabinet meeting and recommended President's rule
 isi bich ensipi ke netaa nawab malik yah kehete najar aae ki unke paas bahumat he, unako samay diya janaa chahie
 When the Governor had given time till 8:30 pm, then why did the NCP write to the Governor House that he should be given 3 days time
 grih mantralay ne kaha ki governor kii report kahati he ki unki taraf se har sambhav koshish ke baad bhi maharashtra kii sarkaar kaa gathan samvidhan ke mutabik najar nahin aa rahaa he
 In such a situation, the Governor has no option but to recommend President's rule
 unhone samvidhan ke anuchhed 356 ke mutabik yah anushansa kii he
 What the Home Ministry said in its statement: The Home Ministry said in its statement that the Governor of Maharashtra believed that the electoral process has ended 15 and no political party is in a position to form a government, so it is better to impose President's rule in the state Will happen
 isse pehle, ravivaar ko bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne kaha tha ki vah apane gathbandhan ke saathi shivasena ke rukh ko dekhte hue maharashtra main sarkaar gathan nahin karegi
 In the 288-member assembly, the BJP emerged as the single largest party by winning 105 seats and was easily in a position to form a government with the Shiv Sena, but the 56-member Shiv Sena refused to support the BJP due to differences over the chief minister's post
 Had given
 uske baad se shivasena ne congress or rakanpa kii madad se sarkaar gathan karne kaa prayaas kiya
 The Governor first invited the BJP to form the government, after which he invited the Shiv Sena on Sunday
 shivasena ko haalanki 24 ghante kii samaysima main paryaapt vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil nahin ho sakaa
 Koshiyari then invited NCP to form the government on Monday evening and gave time till 8 pm on Tuesday night to show support, though President's rule was imposed in the state before that
 rajyapal ke faisle par supreme court pahunchi shivasenashivsena ne maharashtra ke rajyapal ke faisle ke khilaaf sunwaayee ke liye supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya he

 sheersh court kii registry ko is par abhi pradhan nyaayadhish se manjuuri milani baaki he, jisase maamle ko soochibaddh kiya ja sake
 Explain that Shiv Sena is trying to form a coalition government with the support of Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in the state but it has failed to get letters of support from both parties
 maharashtra rajyapal kaa kadam raajnneeti se prerit : congrescongress ne maharashtra ke rajyapal bies koshyari ke rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagane kii anushansa karne ke kadam ko raajnneeti se prerit bataaya
 The party said that the governor did not give enough time to the invited parties and despite inviting all the parties, he did not invite the Congress to form the government
 congress ke mukhya pravaktaa randeep singh surajevaala ne twit main kaha, 'rajyapal koshyari ne maharashtra main loktantr kaa apmaan kiya or raashtrapati shashan kii anushansa karke sanvaidhanik prakriya kaa majaak udaaya he
 He said, "in the absence of the single largest party in Maharashtra, the governor should first call the largest pre-poll alliance bjp-shiv Sena together and then congress-ncp, the second largest coalition
" 'surajevaala ne congress ko aamantrit nahin karne ke liye bhi rajyapal par sawaal uthaae
 He said, 'even if the Governor called individual parties, why did he not call the Congress? Why there was a mess in giving time before imposing President's rule
 bhaajapa ko 48 ghante, shivasena ko 24 ghante or rakanpa ko 24 ghante bhi nahin
 This step is inspired by politics

 *** My grandfather came to this city not long ago but after the partition of India and Pakistan
 ve paposh nagar ke kuch had tak alag-thalag makaan ke ground floor main ek bedroom vaale hisse main rahete the
 Its roof was low, the doors were weak and the floor was covered with concrete strips
 uske peeche ek sahan hone ke baavjood yahaan rahane par kisi ko ghutan mahasoos ho sakati thi
 The family then had 15 members, most of whom used to sleep by laying four beds under the open sky because it was hot inside
 main haal main kaaphi arase baad paposh nagar gaya tha
 When i reached there, curious kids from the neighborhood started bouncing a worn tennis ball
 jab maine unhen bataaya ki mere dada yahaan rah chuke hai to unhone makaan maalik kii patni ko mere aane kii khabar di
 Put his hand on his waist, he said, "my husband is at the shop
 '' vahi dukaan jise unke walid pachaas saal pehle chalaate the
 We used to see the landlord as the owner and as a celebrity: they lived on us, they had property and the business ran
 haalanki kai baar aise maukey bhi aae jab mere dada apni aath santanon kaa pet bharne ke naakaabil rahe or unhen apane rishtedaaron ke yahaan bhej diya
 But my grandmother, who is slim, illiterate, wearing a sari, and Purbia, made sure that her children read, work hard and perform well

 The pace of migration is very straightforward: each wave removes the previous wave from its place and each community collides with another, then resides with it

 This is the reason that when the Delhi government and the MCD have not yet appointed 33 thousand teachers in schools, then the High Court had to give strict orders to start this process in 3 weeks
 darasal dilli sarkaar ke sarkari skulon me 27 hazaar shikshakon kii niyakti honi he
 Which is currently about 50 percent of the number of teachers working
 yani dilli sarkaar ke skulon main 50 fisadi shikshak rakhe bina hi bacchon ko shiksha di ja rahi he
 This is the situation when Delhi government itself has been claiming to improve education in government schools by becoming Mian Mittu
 ab sochiye ki jab kisi skool me aadhe shikshak honge hi nahin to padhai bhala kaise hogi
 The condition of MCD schools is similar to that of Delhi government schools
 yahaan teenon emsidi main kul milakar 6 hazaar shikshakon ke pad khaali hai
 The High Court has slammed the Delhi government and the MCD over the appointment of teachers when the BJP, Congress and Aam Aadmi Party are busy counting their achievements during the MCD elections

 The High Court was extremely upset that despite several previous orders, the government has not taken the matter of appointment of teachers seriously, which is directly playing with the future of children
 hycourt shikshakon kii bhartee se judi ek avmaananaa yachika par bhi sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 The court had already ordered in 2016 that these teachers be appointed immediately, but when the government and the MCD did not comply with the order, lawyer Ashok Aggarwal filed a contempt petition last year
 ashok agarwal bataate hai ki pehali baar shikshakon kii kami ko puraa karne ke liye 2001 me yachika lagaai thi
 In 2008, the court also ordered the appointment of teachers, but even after 9 years, the condition has worsened rather than improved
 garib se garib aadmi bhi sarkari skulon kii aisi haalat dekhne ke baad apane baccho ko yahaan daakhila nahin dilaanaa chahta
 After this order of the court, there is a hope once again that children studying in government schools will not have to suffer the loss of education due to lack of teachers in schools
 agar court ke aadesh or cameti kii siforeeshon par jald amal hua to mumkin he ki sarkari skulon main agle satr tak shikshakon kii kami ko puraa kar liya jayega

 teenon main baatcheet kaa daur chal hi rah tha ki bandook kii goli kii raftaar se ek bada pathar chalati car kii chat faadta hua andar ghusaa or car chalaa rahe bank manager ashok verma ke sir par aa gira
 The stone fell on Ashoka's head so fast that his head exploded and he died on the spot
 ghatana ke baad police maukey par pahunchi or shav ko postmortem ke liye bhej diya
 Additional SP RS Mishra said, "the employees of the bank were getting into the car
 haive ke paas bane ek stone krashar main blasting se pathar uchhal gaya jo inaki car kii chat todate hue uski sir par gira or ashok verma kii ghatnasthal par hi maut ho gai
 The accident caused by the blasting in the crusher has registered a case and started investigation and sealed this crusher
 is dardanaak ghatana ke baad sawaal khadey ho rahe hai ki haive par tej raftaar se bhaagti gadiyon ko krashar main blasting se pehle roka kyon nahin gaya tha
 The second question is why the crusher was allowed to be blasted so close to the highway and why the necessary precautionary steps were not taken before the blasting, due to which an innocent lost his life

 How did you miss this poem on 'spring' in this cold season? Because both its author Raghuveer Sahai was born and died this December
 9 disambar, 1929 ko lakhanu main janm or 30 disambar, 1990 ko dilli main maut
 Between this time, Raghuvir Sahai did not write what
 vah ek bade rachanaakaar the
 Wonderful writer who brings together literature and journalism
 raghuveer sahay kii rachanaaen aadhunik samay kii dhadakanon kaa jeevant dastavej hai
 Apart from articles, he wrote poetry, story, essays and what to say about his attitude
 lakhanu vishvavidhyalay se 1949 main angrezi sahitya main eme karne se pehle hi raghuveer sahay sahitya srijan or patrakarita karne lage the
 After obtaining a master's degree, she came to Delhi in a jugaad of livelihood
 yahaan unhen naukari mili, or yaheen shaadi bhi kii
 He became an important pillar of contemporary Hindi poetry here along with wife and identity
 alam yah tha ki kabhi unke sahitya main patrakarita aa jaati, to kabhi unki patrakarita par sahitya haaavee ho jaataa
 See one of his hallmarks in the poem 'adhinayak': Who is better in the national anthem? Who is sitting on the throne of hell, who is the best person, who is that person, he is a great man, whose mind plays every day
 Ayra, called agents of India in Pakistan Gyaraghuvir Sahay second poet octave
 unki kavitaayen azaadi ke baad 60 ke dashak se shuru hue daur kii tasviir ko samagrata main pesh karti hai
 An India which, as it progressed, was struggling with a new kind of slavery of non-equality, injustice and strong class
 isiilie unki samoochee kavy-yatra kaa lakshya aisi janatantric vyavastha kaa nirmaan karnaa tha, jisamen bhukh, shoshan, anyaay, hatya, aatmahatya, vishmata, daastaa, raajnneetik samprabhutaa, jati, dharm, sampradaay, ling ke chalate koi bhedbhaav na ho
 He wanted the hopes and dreams with which the fight for freedom was fought to be realized
 bataur patrkaar, sampadak unhone netaaon or shaasha varg ke dohare chehre or charitra ko behad najadik se dekha tha
 His poem 'aapki Laughter' written about this subject is still very present today
 uske tevar aap swayan dekhen:nirdhan janata kaa shoshan haikah kar aap hanselokatantr kaa antim kshan haikah kar aap hansesbake sab hai bhrashtacharikah kar aap hansecharon ore badi laachaarikah kar aap hansekitne aap surakshit hongemain sochane lagasahsa mujhe akelaa paa karphir se aap hanserghuveer sahay ne lambey samay tak samvaadadaata, sampadak, sameekshak or samskruti lekhak ke taur par un muddon, vishyon ko chuaa, jin par tab tak sahitya jagat main bahut kam likhaa gaya tha
 He expressed the suffering of the common man in his own style
 'aatmahatya ke viruddh' apane sankalan kii 36 kavitaaon ke jariye unhone maanav dwandv or laalach kaa bakhubi chithran kiya
 Raghuveer Sahai is a very long-remembered poet
 unhone sahitya main aksar ajanabiiyat or akelepan ko lekar likhi jane vaali kavitaaon se pare jaakar un muddon ko chuaa, jo jivan or jeevantta se sidhe jude the
 Sahai was not merely a poet sarcastic on politics
 unki kavitaaon main patrakarita ke tevar or akhbaari tajurba saaf-saaf dikhaai detaa tha
 Book excerpt- Why i am Hindu: Hindu and Hinduism in the words of Shashi Tharoor, in a way, in terms of language and craft, Raghuvir Sahai's poems are reminiscent of Nagarjuna
 us daur ke teen sheersh naamon main muktibodh, shamsher ke saath raghuveer bhi shaamil the
 But these three had their own specialties
 gajanan madhav muktibodh jahaan fantasy bunane ke liye jane jate the or shamsher bahadur singh apni shaayari gunane ke liye, vahiin raghuveer sahay apane vishay, bhashaa or shilp ke liye lokapriy the
 See its hallmark in a poem called 'nari' written about women discourse: Nari Bichari Hapurush's Mari Hatan with Mudit Haiman from Hutat Hapak Kar Jap Karant is a surprise
 It is not surprising that when Rajkamal Prakashan published Raghuveer Sahay Rachnavali in 6 volumes
 Writing in the introduction, 'today is the time defined in its entirety in his composition published in six volumes
 apni adwitiya sarjanshiltaa ke kaaran raghuveer sahay aise kaaljayi rachanakaaron main hai, jinaki praasangikta samay bitne ke saath badhati hi jaati he
 Raghuveer Sahai gave a new look to Hindi poetry due to his new story and craft
 ’ tay he aise log or unki kavitaayen hameshaa kaaljayi hai
 He should be judged by his relevance more than the number of compositions and his popularity, and Raghuvir Sahai has stood the test

 ek yujar ne rohit sharma par coment karte hue kaha ki rohit sharma keval do hi surat main aglaa test match khel sakate hai, agar vah captain kohli se kahen ki yah meraa aakhri test match hoga yaa rohit duusari pari main badhiya pradarshan kar de
 Rohit sharma will play 3rd test match in only 2 condition

 If rohit tells virat that this is my last test match2
 If rohit play a match winning knock in 2nd innings # savind # indvsa # savsindrt if you agree— Mycricweb (@mycricweb)january 14, 2018iske alaava kai phens ne rohit sharma ko ajinkya rahane kii jagah khilaae jane kaa virodh karte hue kaaphi twits kiye hai
 I'm More Concerned If Somehow Rohit Sharma Manage To Score In This Match We Might Lose a Gem Of a Test Match Batsman Like Ajinkya Rahane

 Every day! Every Time! Every Which way! - Ravishankar v (@raviveeraghanta) January 14, 2018 sisodiya ne CABE kii baithak main rakhe prastaav kaa elaan kiyaunhone kaha- nai shiksha policy privet shiksha board banane kii taraf ishaara karti hedilli sarkaar main shiksha mantri manish sisodiya ne CABE kii baithak main rakhe prastaav kaa elaan kiya he
 He said that the main 3 issues related to education policy were discussed in the meeting
 is dauraan sisodiya ne kaha ki bharat main shiksha par bahut kam kharch kiya jaataa he
 He said that there will be commissions of state and center, there will be council, this will get stuck in the education commission
 lekin aage kaa road map kya hoga? sisodiya ne kaha ki maine aaj is baat kaa prastaav rakhaa he ki kanoon bane jisamen centre or rajya sarkaar jidipi ke 6 fisadi ke barbar rakam shiksha bajet ke liye rakhen
 He said that giving education should be the responsibility of the government
 lekin rashtriya shiksha niti ke kai niyam privet skool ko badhaava dete hai
 Sisodia said, 'the new education policy points towards the creation of a private education board
 mere dwaara privet board kaa virodh kiya gaya he
 The private board will affect the quality of education, everyone will make their school chains which will not be right
 'unhone kaha ki desh main farji degree sabase badi chunauti he
 There is no solution to prevent false degrees
 nai shiksha niti main har college ko degree dene kaa adhikaar he, jo nahin dena chahie
 At the same time, Sisodia said that it is a wrong idea to make all the institutes of the country multi-faculty
 sarkaar shiksha de yah jaruri he lekin privet board bananaa sahi nahin hoga
 "A Good deed is the best prayer"

 ) bastar ke aiji esarapy kalluri lambii chuttee par chale gaye hai lekin jate-jate unhone ek whats ap group main sandesh bheja or likhaa – ‘bela bhaatia vins’ yani bela bhaatia jeet gai
 Significantly, the controversy erupted at the residence of social activist Bela Bhatia on January 23 after some people created an uproar and intimidation
 kareeb 30 logon kii bheed ne bela bhaatia se bastar chhod dene kaa kaha tha
 Since then, questions have arisen as to whether the self-styled organizations of Bastar will continue to threaten social workers, human rights organizations, journalists and lawyers at the instigation of the police
 aiji kalluri kii chuttee par jane kii baat kii varisht adhikariyon ne pushti kii thi or kaha tha ki unhen ilaaj ke liye lambii chuttee di gai he
 But from the messages Kalluri has sent on the whatsapp, it seems that he wants to tell that he has been removed and he himself did not seek leave
 kalluri ne ek sandesh main likhaa he “mujhe anischitkaal ke liye chuttee par jane ko kaha gaya he
 i am grateful for your cooperation
 mujhe vishwaas he ki aap acha kaam karte rahenge
 Thank you all from my family
 
 
 ” After this message from Kalluri, NDTV India spoke to DM Awasthi, Special DG (naxal Operation) of Bastar, who said, "I will not say anything on whatsapp messages but will say that he (kalluri) has done well in Bastar in the last few years
" Worked but he is not well and he has been asked to go on leave

 Members of Agni were earlier in an organization called Samajik Ekta Manch accused of threatening journalists Malini Subramaniam, lawyers Shalini Gera and Isha Khandelwal and forcing them to leave Bastar
 kalluri july 2014 main bastar ke aiji banaae gaye or uske baad se bastar main kai naksali aatmasamarpan hue

 ” Delhiites faced double trouble on Monday
 ek taraf thand badhane se paara neeche chalaa gaya, to vahiin duusari taraf pradooshan or kohre kii vajah se somvaar subah visibility behad kam ho gai
 Also, people started having difficulty in breathing
 aisa is vajah se hua kyonki aasmaan main smog kii maatra bad gai he
 Pollution increased when the wind stopped, says Kuldeep Srivastava, Senior Scientist in the Meteorological Department of Delhi, that the speed of the winds had completely stopped in Delhi on Monday morning
 isaki vajah se hawa main maujuud pradooshan kohre ke saath milakar khatarnaak smog ban gaya
 Due to which the visibility reached 300 meters on one side and on the other hand people also had to face difficulty in breathing
 thami hui haihvaa kii raftaarashreevastav ne aage kaha ki aane vaale 2 se 3 din sthiti bilkul jas kii tas rahane vaali he kyonki hawa kii raftaar thami hui he
 However, there is an advantage in that there is a slight rise in temperature
 ravivaar ke mukaable somvaar ko minimum temparechar main 1 degree kii badhotaree hui he
 Cold and fog will rise again from 26th December, as soon as icy wind will take Delhi in its grip and its effect will be clearly visible in Delhi from next day of Christmas i
e
 26th December
 thandi hawa chalane se taapmaana neeche jayega
 At the same time, fog will also increase on the other side
 isaki vajah se thand kaa ahsaas zyada hoga
 In such a situation, it can be assumed that the beginning of the new year will be in Delhi amid the shivering winter and dense fog
 loksabhaa chunaav main mili karaari haar ke baad samaajawaadee party (sapa) main philhal ekta kii tasviir dhundhlee-si dikhaai de rahi he
 After the results, it seemed that uncle and nephew would reunite to save the family and the party, but now this thing is starting to get breathless
 lagaataar do loksabhaa chunaav or ek vidhansabha chunaav haarane ke baad akhilesh par parivaar ko ek karne kaa dabaav badha he
 Especially SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav wants younger brother Shivpal Singh Yadav to be brought back together to contribute to make the party stand
 lekin akhilesh raji nahin hai
 He feels that Shivpal's entry will threaten his monopoly and domination in the party
 akhilesh ke karibiyon kaa maananaa he ki sapa adhyaksh nahin chaahate ki party main ek baar phir satta ke kai centre bane
 With the arrival of Shivpal, its chances will increase manifold
 kuch vyaktigat baaten bhi aisi rahi hai ki shivpal ko lekar akhilesh kadavaahat dur nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Since the defeat of the SP-BSP-RLD alliance in the Lok Sabha elections, efforts are being made to bring socialist leaders on one platform
 sutron kaa kahana he ki pramukh netaaon se alag-alag vaarta main mulaayam singh yadav puraane kaaryakartaaon ko ek manch par laakar bhaajapa kaa vikalp taiyaar karne kii ichha jataa chuke hai
 Political analyst Ratnamani Lal states that "there is no hesitation from Shivpal
 unhen lagata he ki unki varishthata ke chalate ab vah party main jaaenge to unhen koi bada pad milegaa
 Shivpal has shown his courage by forming a separate party
 isliye unki kshamta par bhi koi shaq nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Both Akhilesh and Mulayam know that they have a big hand in getting SP here
 "unhone kaha, "shivpal ko maaloom he ki unki is baar party main kya bhoomika hogi
 He will merge his party on his own terms
 abhi philhal unhen manaane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 He knows that he is his upperhand
 vah shrey lenaa chaahate hai ki jis party ko mulaayam ne banaaya or akhilesh ne duboya, use shivpal ubaar sakate hai
 Therefore, Shivpal does not have any problem in this
 akhilesh ko dikkat hogi
 "significantly, Shivpal split from SP last year and formed his own party
 haalanki, dilachasp baat yah he ki shivpal yadav abhi bhi sapa se hi vidhayak hai
 Despite this, no letter has been written by the SP high command to date to end Shivpal's membership
 jabaki sapa ke khilaaf loksabhaa chunaav main vah khud bhi maidan main the or apni party se kai netaaon ko alag siton par maidan main utaara tha
 That is why the SP has still left some great scope for reconciliation
 lekin pragatisheel samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya shivpal sih yadav ne sapa main vaapasi se saaf inkaar kiya he
 However, he maintained the possibility of an alliance
 apane awaas par prasapa ke jila or shahar adhyakshon kii samiksha baithak ke baad unhone sanghathan kaa punargathan kar varsh 2022 ke vidhansabha chunaav main prasapa ko mukhya mukaable main laane kaa daawa kiya he
 Shivpal says that due to lack of sufficient time to prepare for the Lok Sabha elections, the expected results could not be achieved
 prasapa pravaktaa deepak mishra kaa kahana he ki gathbandhan kii raajnneeti fail sabit hone ke baad janata kii nigahen prasapa kii ore lagi hai
 Praspa supremo Shivpal Yadav himself has also stopped the talk of returning home to the Samajwadi Party
 amarbel kaa naam to aapane suna hi hoga
 The tree on which Amarbel grows
 use puraa dhak leti he
 The corruption of Lalu Yadav, the head of the Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar, is like Amarbel, who has taken the entire family under his control
 bihar ke up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ke istife ko lekar machaa bavaal lalu yadav ke akut sampatti ikthta kar lene ke laalach kaa hi nateeja he ki unka sabase honhaar raajnneetik uttaradhikari apane siyaasi kariyar ke shuruyaat main hi bhrashtachar ke jaal main funs gaya he
 It is not that no leader has been accused of corruption in Indian politics, but this is the first unique case when a son has to face the punishment of his father's misdeeds
 bhartiya raajnneeti kii vansbel bahut samrudh he, lekin tejasvi kii tarah kisi ko apane pita ke bhrashtachar kii tarah vipaksh ke hamalon kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa
 However, it can be said that Tejashwi was not playing on the political pitch from the beginning and he showed political trends much later
 isamen koi do raay nahin lalu ke beton ko mantri pad apane pita ke chalate hi mila
 On the other hand, the manner in which the BJP has set a vulture vision on the grand alliance in Bihar to occupy the Bihar chair and weaken Lalu
 usamen tejashvi kaa ghere main aana koi atishyoktipurna nahin he
 According to Tejashwi Yadav, the charges that are being leveled against him, he was dealt at the age of 13-14 years
 tejasvi kii maane to ye deal unke pita ne kii yaa karai
 To secure the future of each of his children, Lalu did not control his greed and greed
 rajd ke mukhiya sam, daam, dand or bhed ke jariye sampatti batorte rahe
 These 'sins' of Lalu have fallen on their children
 chaara ghotaalaa maamle main sunwaayee or sajaa kaa saamana kar rahe lalu ke saamne nai chunautiyaan hai
 The investigation agencies are getting screwed
 lalu or unke bacchon kaa siyaasi vajood khatre main hai

 The apex court ordered that a separate trial be conducted in four other cases registered against the former Chief Minister of Bihar

 Both these hotels were awarded to Sujata Hotels Private Limited through a tender

 The World anti-doping Agency (WADA) has prepared a detailed plan to keep the Commonwealth Games free from the sting of doping and crack down on the guilty players, under which its two teams and the Director General of the organization will be in Delhi during the Games

 jab 2007 main nitish kumaar sarkaar ne jaiprakash narayan kii sampurna kranti andolan ke dauraan jail gaye logon ke liye pension yojana shuru kii to kisi ne nahin sochaa tha ki ise sahi myne main lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 This entire revolution movement of 1974 toppled Indira Gandhi's government in 1977
 yojana ke amal par andeh jataane kii kai vajahen thim
 More than 30 years had passed since the agitation ended and many of the real entitlements of pension had left the state and gone elsewhere
 khaas yah ki asli daavedaaron kii pahchaan sirf jail record ke aadhaar par hi ho sakati thi or bahut-si jelon se yah record gaayab the
 Not only this, there were many claimants who had no record but had close acquaintance with the big leaders of Bihar
 ye netaa bhi sampurna kranti andolan ke dauraan jail main rahe the
 As soon as the Bihar government asked for applications for pension, the applications started falling
 grih sachiv kii mej par kul 50,000 aavednon kaa dher lag gaya
 Their number was increasing and there was a lot of public pressure to implement the plan quickly
 subhaani kaa kaam aisa ho gaya tha jaise bhuse ke dher main sui dhundmai ho
 Subhani was well aware that Jayaprakash's entire revolution movement was the most important political movement of independent India, which changed the face of politics, at least in Hindi regions
 nitish kumaar or unke purv up-mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi bhi apatkaal main jail gaye the
 Nitish's political rival Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) President Lalu Prasad Yadav and Lok Janshakti Party President Ram Vilas Paswan also fall in this category
 us dauraan jail main band kuch netaa ab bihar main mantri hai
 It is a matter of fact that no senior leader had applied for pension
 subhaani kehete hai, “pension sarkari khajaane se di jaani thi isliye har daavedaari ke liye pukhta saboot jaruri the
 "some prison records were mutilated and eaten of termites that could not be read
 khagadipha jaisi kuch jelon main to puraane record the hi nahin kyonki ve baadh main bah gaye the
 Topper Subhani in Statistics became the Principal Home Secretary of Bihar in October 2009 and pledged to complete this work in a systematic manner
 kendriya vibhageeya samiti ne 50,000 aavednon main se harek kii jaanch jail nireekshak se karai
 Thereafter 2,539 suitable pensioners were elected
 itnaa hi nahin subhaani ne khud har daavedaari kii jaanch kii
 After this, the name of each eligible claimant was put on the website
 pension sidhe daavedaaron ke bank khaaton main jamaa kii gai
 So far, the Government of Bihar is worth 34 crores
 bataur pension bhugtan kar chuki he
 While giving leadership in the true sense, Subhani attributes the completion of the work to Rajiv Verma, deputy secretary of the department , saying, “without him, this work could not have happened
 ” 1987 batch ke iees adhikari, subhaani har vakt kaam main duube rahete hai
 9 in the morning daily 30 baje daftar main hajir rahete hai or der shaam tak kaam karte hai
 There is no gurus like senior IAS officer among them

 angela apane bachche ko lekar dentist ke paas pahunchi or unhen puri ummid thi ki unke bete ko daanton se judi koi samasya nahin hogi
 Like a responsible mother, Angela was always vigilant about the health of her children
 unhen lagata tha ki wo unke daanton kaa bhi puraa dhyaan rakhti hai
 She kept her children away from everything that could harm them
 par dentist ne jab unhen ye bataaya ki fin kedoodh ke daanton main cavity haito angela hairaan rah gayi
 It had been nearly six months since this cavity was made
 angela bataati hai ki unhen laga ki wo duniya kii sabase buree maa hai
 But even at that time, he did not know how his son had become so sick
 unke anusaar unke bachche na to bahut adhik junk food khate hai or na hi kuch meetha khaane ke baad bina munh dhoe rahete hai
 How did this happen again? Professor Dameen Wollmsley, Scientific Advisor at the British Dental Association, says that children today are much more enthusiastic about snacks, which makes them more prone to cavity
 shodhakarta maanate hai ki kai baar mata-pita kii jarurat se zyada dekhbhaal kii vajah se bhi bacchon ke daant kharaab ho jate hai
 They feel that their child should drink healthy drinks, take Ugurt and other drinks
 par wo ye bhul jate hai ki in sabhi main sugar kii bharpoor maatra hoti he, jo bachche ke daanton par bahut bura asar daalata he
 Children's teeth are affected in two ways
 ek to un khaadya padaarthon ke seven se jinamein amleeyta hoti he or duusare ve jinamein sugar hoti he
 Acidic food destroys enamel, the upper layer of teeth, while sugar gives rise to bacteria
 angela ke maamle main bhi yahi hua tha
 Angela used to give juice, honey-grain bars to her children in order to provide nutritious food
 wo apane bacchon ko raat ke vakt doodh pilaakar hi sulaati thim
 They felt that calcium was very good for their children's teeth
 par jaisaa ki doctor nathvani kaa kahana he ki din ke samay doodh kaa seven acha he lekin raat ke vakt isamen maujuud lactose joki ek prakaar kii sharkara hi hoti he, daanton ko nuksaan pahunchaati he
 Most parents feel that drinking milk at night will be very beneficial for their children, but few parents know that giving milk to the child at the wrong time is rather weak and weak

 The government of Uttarakhand has to intervene itself to discuss dengue prevention
 centre se ai swasthya mantralay kii gathit team dwaara gandhi shatabdi aspataal main pradesh ke doctoron ke saath dengue par charchaa kii gai
 The team told that due to heavy rains and indiscriminate construction in Uttarakhand this season, dengue has taken a terrible form this time

 In 2014, a guideline was released in Delhi under the All India Guidance called National Guideline of Dengue
 isi guideline ke tahat ab uttarakhand main dengue kaa ilaaj hoga
 Giving more information, the Health Department team said that platelets are low in dengue at first and in such a time, the patient does not panic at all, but taking the advice of his doctor, dengue can be treated at home

 soshal media par baaghon, sheron or tenduon kii kahaniyaan aksar dekhne ko milti hai
 Sometimes it touches the heart and many times it touches the heart

 Some such claims were revealed that these gruesome pictures are of Daringbadi in Odisha
 uttar pradesh ke chandauli zile, himachal pradesh or telugana main warangal bhi un daavon main shaamil the jo in tasveeron kii lokation ko lekar internet yugers ne kiye
 India Today Fact Check found that these photos and videos are old, so the claims made about them are false
 sabhi viral poston main, aatankit karne vaale baaghon ke hamale kaa video vibhinn whatrup grups par share kiya ja rahaa he or daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki ye haadasa daringbadi main ek party ke dauraan hua
 It can be seen in this video that two to three tigers are attacking a person badly
 video main un bhaybheet logon kii cheekh-pukaar bhi sunai de rahi he jo dur se us shaks ko bachaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 In the video, these people can also be seen firing firecrackers on their side to drive away the tigers
 daringbadi main baagh ke haalia hamale kii ghatana ke liye hamane search kiya to odishapost dot com main 13 janvari 2019 kii ek report mili jisamen ye ullekh tha ki aisa koi bhi hamalaa haal main daringbadi kshetra main nahin hua
 In the report, quoting the forest ranger (forest guard), it was also claimed that the locals had circulated such pictures and videos so that the tourists coming for the holidays would stay away from the area
 navabharat times ne bhi is khabar ko cover karte hue ise ‘afvaah’ bataaya
 In this, a social media user was also told that this video is from a zoo in China
 hamane china ke chidyaghar main baagh ke hamale kii ghatana ko lekar utyub par search kiya to staronline par ye video mila
 It was reported that a man was killed by a tiger in June 2017 at Yongor Zoo in eastern China
 ye shaks tikat ke bhugtan se bachane ke liye sher ke baade main ghus gaya tha
 The next challenge before us was confirmed viral photos of the leopard attack
 aisi hi ek tasviir main dikhaaya gaya tha ki sadak par ek he or uske aasapaas kai motorbike padi hui hai
 In another picture, the scared people can be seen climbing on top of the tree
 ye tasviren beete ek hafte se soshal media par faili hui hai
 While some users claimed on whatsapp that the leopard attack happened in Nandi Hills of Bengaluru, some said that the attack took place in Aarey Milk Colony, Mumbai
 online news portal npnews24 kii report main daawa kiya gaya ki hamalaa mumbai kii aare colony main hua
 When we did a reverse search of one of the available photos, we found that Twitter user @ ketan83 posted similar pictures in his tweet and appealed to people to ignore the rumors
 usne daawa kiya ki tendue kaa ye hamalaa maharashtra ke chiplun main huajab hamane 'leopard attack in Chiplun' kiward ke saath search kiya to jaimaharshtranews kaa ek news video dekhne ko mila jisamen chiplun main tendue par hue hamale ko dekha ja saktaa he
 We also found the exact spot where the leopard was lying on the road and motorbikes were seen nearby
 india today is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ki ye tasviren or video naa sirf purana or bhraamak he balki ye alag alag jagahon kii alag ghatnaayen hai
