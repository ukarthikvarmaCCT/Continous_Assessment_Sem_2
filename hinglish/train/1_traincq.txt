 Shifted to new house Union Home Minister Amit Shahbangla 6A, former Prime Minister Vajpayee lived in this bungalow in Krishna Menon Marg, the home address of Union Home Minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah changed from Tuesday
 amit shah aaj bangala 6A, krishna menon maarg main shift ho gaye
 Recently Amit Shah was allotted this bungalow
 isse pehle ye bangala purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ko mila hua tha
 In 2004, this bungalow was allotted to Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 haalanki pichley saal 16 agast ko atal bihari vaajapeyi ke nidhan ke baad unke parivaar ne ye bangala khaali kar diya tha
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee lived in this bungalow from his departure from the post of Prime Minister till his death
 atal bihari vaajapeyi se pehle yah bangala diemke saansad murasoli maaran ko alot tha
 Earlier, the official residence of Amit Shah was 11, Akbar Road
 6A, krishna menon maarg kaa bangala tip 8 he, jo lagbhag dhai acre main bana hua he
 In the past fortnight, there has been a condition of mara-mari in Punjab and Haryana regarding urea
 rabi kii buvaai puri hone ke baad fasal kii paidaavaar badhaane ke liye kisaanon ko uria kii darkaar hoti he, lekin donon rajyon main uria depo ke baahar kisaanon kii lambii kataren dikh rahi hai
 In some places the patience of the farmers was answered
 hisar main kisaanon ko laathiyaan khaani padin, jhajjar main kisaanon ne uria se ladaa trek lut liya to jind main ve depo par dhaava bolkar uria ke bag chin le gaye
 The licenses of four depots in Jalandhar and Ludhiana on the charge of black marketing have been canceled, but overall the farmers are angry with the situation
 punjab ke muktsar jile main line main khadey ek kisaan ne bataaya, 'uria kii bahut problem aa rahi he
 
 
 No one is getting urea
 
 
 isi mausam main daalana hota he, zarurat ke mutabik, lekin kisi ko nahin mil rahaa he
 
 
 ' vahiin haryana ke sirsa main ghanton line main khadey rahane ke baad bhi uria nahin mila, to kisaanon kaa gussa foot padaa
 a farmer told his condition something like, 'I am standing in line from seven in the morning to take manure
 
 
 ab teen baj gaye hai
 
 
 The throat is dry due to hunger and thirst
 
 
 inase pucho to kehete hai ki krishi vibhaag vaale baant rahe hai
 
 
 Go to them, then say that the staff is low
 
 
 ' According to experts, the policies of the central government are responsible for the current situation - the consumption of urea is highest between November and January, but the central government could not supply their quota to punjab-haryana
 saal 2014 main sarkaar ne naptha aadhaarit uria utpaadan par se sabsidi hataa lee thi, jiske chalate kai plant band hue
 The government delayed to rectify the mistake and urea did not arrive at its destination at the right time due to skepticism about transport subsidies
 punjab ke mukhyamantri ne disambar main pradhanmantri ko khat likhakar rajya kaa kota jald jari karne kii darkhwaast kii thi, lekin ab kah rahe hai ki koi kami nahin he
 Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal said, 'urea has come more than last year
 
 
 kuch kisaan hadabadi main zyaada kharid rahe hai, kuch kalabazari ho rahi he
 
 
 We have also added reds
 
 
 ' On the other hand, the Haryana government could not muster the courage to complain
 krishi mantri opi dhankhad ne kaha, 'main danke kii chot par kahata hum ki 70,000 metric ton hooda sarkaar se zyaada aayaa he is saal
 
 
 The rate is lower in the neighboring states, so we have had some problems
 
 
 ' Punjab and Haryana account for 75% of the central food pool of wheat
 yah ilaaka desh kii ann kii zarurat ko puraa karata he
 Urea is essential to increase yields, but conditions like riots outside the urea depots in both states Punjab and Haryana are not a good sign for the wheat crop, and it can have a direct impact on food security
 kai logon ko maut kii neend sula dene vaale psychokiller udayan das ko ek baar phir raipur kii jila adaalat main pesh kiya gaya
 Udayan Das came into the limelight about two years ago when he killed his girlfriend Akanksha in Bhopal and made her grave in the house
 isse pehle usne raipur main apane mata pita kii hatya kar unhen bhi apane paitruk ghar main dafn kar diya tha
 Udyan Das, who brutally murdered three people, is now lodged in the district jail of Bankura in West Bengal
 somvaar ko jab teen rajyon kii police abhiraksha main udayan ko adaalat parisar main laayaa gaya to logon ke jehan main us khaufnak ghatana kii yaaden taaja ho gayi
 Udayan Das, who was fond of expensive vehicles and lived in a high profile manner, created a panic by killing him in a series
 raipur kii jila adaalat main kadi suraksha ke bich hatya or aapraadhik sajeesh ke aaropee udayan das ko jaj ke kaksh main le jaaya gaya
 So far, statements of 62 witnesses have been recorded in this sensational murder case
 somvaar ko adaalat main paanch mahatvapurn gavaahon ke bayaan bhi darj kiye jane the, lekin adaalat main keval ek gavaah hi upasthit ho paaya
 The ancestral home of Udayan Das's parents still exists in the beautiful Nagar area of raipur
 haalanki udayan das ne apane mata pita ko maut ke ghat utaarne ke baad unke farji hastakshar or power of atorni ke jariye use third party ko bech diya tha
 The police has registered another case of fraud in this case
 udayan das kii aapraadhik sajeesh main yah baat bhi saamne ai thi ki wo apni maa ko maut ke ghat utaarne ke baad kai varsho tak farji dastavejon ke jariye unki pension khud letaa rahaa
 He spent this amount of pension on his passion for selfishness and jismaphiroshi
 iske pehle usne bhopal main apni premika aakanksha sharma kihatyaki thi
 Akanksha and Udayan came close to each other in the year 2007 through social media
 usne aakanksha ko apane prem jaal fansaa liya tha
 He told Akanksha that he is a US citizen and often comes to Bhopal to meet his parents
 phir kuch varsho tak aakanksha or udayan bhopal main pati patni ke rup main rahe
 But when the genuineness of Udayan came in front of the aspiration, there was a fierce conflict between the two
 ek din udayan ne aakanksha kii hatya kar uski laash apane ghar main hi dafn kar di thi
 On the other hand, Akanksha's parents, who live in Bankura district of West Bengal, had reported her missing to the local police station
 jab police aakanksha kii khojbin main juty, tab ek ke baad ek udayan ke gunaah saamne aane lage
 It was also revealed that he is a psycho killer
 bharat main saal bhar se is baat par bavaal machaa hua he ki rasoi gas ke daam aasmaan kyon chhu rahe hai or sienji steshnon kii line choti kyon nahin ho rahi, lekin bharat sarkaar aaayaatit prakritik gas ko pakistan ko bechney main mast he
 This was answered by the Petroleum Minister on the answer of Ram Jethmalani, MP in Rajya Sabha
 yahi nahin petroleum mantri ne sweekaar kiya ki desh ke vibhinn sectoron kii maang ko puraa karne ke liye desh ke paas paryaapt prakritik gas maujuud nahin he
 The government admitted that due to the increasing demand for gas, the availability of gas in the country is not able to make any move
 iske baavjood desh pakistan ko 5 mmasiemdi aaayaatit aralenji gas niryaat kar rahaa he
 It is being exported for a period of five years through the Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL)
 sarkaar kii ichha to pakistan se sthaayee qaraar karke gas bechney kii thi lekin pakistan hi iske liye rajamand nahin hua

 In the General Elections Results 2019, the BJP (JDU) and JDU in Bihar together won 39 out of 40 seats
 argedy (RJD) or congress (congress) ke gathbandhan ko sirf ek seat par jeet mil saki he
 After the results of the Lok Sabha elections 2019, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's sleep on Thursday night will be the most pleasant and comfortable sleep of his political life
 iske kai kaaran hai
 1
 in parinaamon main nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) ke liye sabase zyada sukhad ahsaas is baat kaa hoga ki ve apni raajnneetik pratidwandi party argedy or lalu yadav va unke parivaar ko chunaav main jiro par out karne main kaamyaab hue
 However, Nitish Kumar is the person who called RJD president Lalu Yadav and consoled the defeat of Misa Bharti and Rabri Devi despite his party's debacle in the 2014 elections
 2
 After the bitterness in the relationship with the RJD and the by-elections in Araria Lok Sabha and Jehanabad assembly by-elections last year, Nitish (nitish Kumar) not only on Thursday, after the ruthless defeat of not only RJD but also Jitan Ram Manjhi, Upendra Kushwaha and Mukesh Nishad with him He looked happy but he was satisfied that there is no coalition or equation working against the NDA under his leadership
 Stayed
 3 
 This time the election result once again proved that if a procession is to decide a political victory in Bihar, then Nitish Kumar will have to be kept as a groom
 yah baat khud bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne patna main yojit ek raatri bhoj ke dauraan sweekaar kii thi
 At that time, Patna journalists said that in the complaint of giving seventeen seats to Nitish, BJP should have contested more seats
 tab unka kahana tha ki voton kaa jo pratishat he usamen nitish kumaar ko na naaraaz or na nazarandaz kiya ja saktaa he
 4
 chunaav parinaam se di baaten saafe thim ek endie ke ummidavaaron ko har jati or varg kaa vot mila jo narendra modi kaa cheharaa or nitish (nitish Kumar) kaa saath hone ke kaaran aasaan hua
 On the ground, people should say anything to the media in complaints but due to Modi's coming together with Nitish, the trend in terms of votes was towards NDA candidates
 5
 The one seat that Kishanganj lost in the election results was the reason for Nitish Kumar's most satisfaction
 jaise adhikansh endie pratyaashiyon ko apni jeet ke itane adhik antar kaa andaaza nahin tha vaise hi kishanganj main janata dal pratyaashee ke teen lakh se adhik vot aane kii shaayad nitish ko bhi ummid nahin thi
 But with these votes, Nitish is now confident that in the assembly elections, an effective section of Muslim voters will vote for his coalition in his name
 6
 From the election results, both Nitish Kumar's allies and opponents agreed that the backward castes and Mahadalit community are still holding Nitish's coin
 ye donon vot bank nitish ne apane shashan kaal main banaae or abhi bhi unka vishwaas kisi anya dal se zyaada nitish par he
 7
 haalanki chunaav parinaam ke baad nitish (nitish Kumar) ne mana ki jati ek factor he lekin unhone ye bhi mana ki kaam ko manyata janata degi, jo parinaam se sabit ho gaya
 According to Nitish, importance is of work only
 unke anusaar baaqi jo samaaj ko baantne kii koshish hai ve naakaam huin
 The working group has been supported by the public
 jo jati ko jodakar vishleshan karne kii koshish kar rahe the, ve ab samaj rahe hai
 8
 jati aadhaarit raajnneeti kaa daur ab khatm ho gaya
 This is the happiest thing for Nitish Kumar as questions have been raised about his limited vote bank till now
 9
 Nitish Kumar will also be happy with the result of this election because now he has no political challenge from the rjd-congress alliance in the assembly elections next year
 vaise bhi vot kaa antar bees pratishat se adhik he jise palatney ke liye raajnneetik chamatkaar chahie
 10
 sabase zyaada nitish (nitish Kumar) ke liye santoshjanak baat is lok sabha parinaam se yah rahi ki tejasvi yadav unke liye ab raajnneetik pratidwandvi nahin balki ek vardaan hai jo jab tak unke saamne rahegaa nitish aaraam se bihar kii gaddi par raaj karenge

 Puducherry Election Results 2019tippaniyanpaneloksabhaa kshetra kaa chunaav parinaam (election Results 2019)yahaan dekhendeyai RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat was in Gorakhpur, UP on 11 October
 bihar chunaav ke pehle charan kii voting se thik ek din pehle behad chintit mudra main baithe bhagwat se ek varisht bijepi ne shishtachar main vajah puch lee
 His reply was, "my reservation statement was misinterpreted
 '' us netaa ne hami bharte hue kaha, ''bihar main nichle str tak galat sandesh chalaa gaya he or kaaphi pratikriya bhi he
 But the Sangh's worries were further heightened when the BJP suffered a crushing defeat in the Bihar election results just before Diwali, and party lawmakers like Hukmdev Narayan Yadav, Ashwini Choubey and Shanta Kumar exploded
 in logon ne bhagwat ke bayaan ko haar kii badi vajah qaraar de diya
 It was a bomb that was heard as a blast of disagreement for the first time in 15 months of Modi Raj
 lekin bijepi kii musiibat us vakt bad gai jab maardarshak mandal ke sadsy or party ke varishthatam netaa laalkrishna adwani, murali manohar joshi ke saath purv kendriya vitt mantri yashavanth sinha or shanta kumaar ne saajha bayaan jari kar pradhanmantri modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii kaaryastylee par sawaal uthaate hue dhamaakaa kar diya
 The joint statement clearly stated that the party leadership did not learn any lesson from the Delhi election defeat
 maardarshak mandal ke virdohi sur se pehle hi shah ne maukey kii najaakat bhaanp dilli main maujuud sarasanghachaalak bhagwat ke darbar main hajiri laga saansadon ke aarakshan vaale bayaan par safai di
 The Sangh itself asked Shah to clarify the situation at the party level instead of making any comment in the matter
 to kya yah sangh or bijepi main takaraav kii sthiti he? yaa phir majboot chunauti ke aage dher hone vaali modi-shah kii bijepi kaa sangh ke saamne samarpan?sangh ke ek varisht padaadhikari bhagwat par bijepi saansadon ke aaropon ko niraadhaar bataate hai
 He argues, "bjp's vote percentage has increased, while RJD, Congress and JD (U) 's vote percentage has decreased slightly compared to earlier
 gaiyr-bijepi voton ke ekajute ho jane kii vajah se hi mahagathbandhan ko zyada siten mili he
 If the bjp's vote was a little too much, the statement of reservation of the Sangh chief could be counted as the reasons for the defeat
 lekin yahaan aisi paristhiti hi nahin he
 "it is clear from the Sangh's attitude that it has filled its quiver with arrows to answer the bjp's allegations
" nishchit taur se bihar main bijepi kii haar ne sangh ko party par pakad majboot karne kaa mauka diya he
 The reason for this - Amit Shah's management piled up in the states where he faced a tough challenge
 bijepi ke ek netaa bataate hai, ''shah ke kaarykaal main ham chah rajyon ke chunaav lade, jisamen se 4 jite or do haare
 But we won only where the competition was triangular or quadrangular
 lekin jahaan aamane-saamne kii ladaai hui vahaan chaaron khaane chit ho gaye
 "now the Sangh wants that at least this type of situation does not happen in Uttar Pradesh elections
" chunaav nateezon ke agle din 9 november ko bhagwat-shah mulaakaat main sanghathan kaa nayaa khaakaa taiyaar karne kii ranneeti bani
 According to sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has conveyed his intention to the Sangh and he wants only the modi-shah duo to contest in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 yani shah ko lagaataar do kaarykaal milane kii charchaa he
 But the Sangh is no longer in the mood to give BJP a free hand at the organization level
 sutron kii maane to shah se mulaakaat main bhagwat ne sangh-bijepi kii samanvay baithak ko masik taur se niyamit karne ko kaha he
 If the circumstances are favorable, such meetings will be held in the first week of every month from January 2016, according to the convenience
 itnaa hi nahin, sangh ab bijepi sanghathan main kuch nae prachaarkon ko bhi bhejne par vichaar kar rahaa he, jisaki jhalak shah kii nai team main dikhegi
 But the way the guide board has opened the front, it has also raised the question whether Shah will be able to become president again
 bihar chunaav kii haar kaa asar sarkaar main bhi dikhegaa
 Two types of people from the government can now be brought into the organization
 pehle to ve log jinaki sanghathan main jarurat he or duusare ve mantri jo kisi dar kii vajah se jokhim nahin lete or usase unka pradarshan prabhavit hua he
 Apart from this, the process of appointing BJP workers in the corporations and boards under the Central Government will begin
 kaaryakartaaon ko lagaataar jis tarah se ek ke baad ek abhiyaan main jhonka gaya usase bhi shah kii mahasampark abhiyaan jaisi kai mahatvakankshi yojana fail hui
 However, the Sangh is not seeing the delay in these appointments as the reason for the defeat, but is considering it the defeat of the organization
 sutron ke mutabik, sangh pramukh ne shah ko yah bhi sandesh diya ki bijepi ko nitish-lalu se sabak lene kii jarurat he kyonki donon lambey samay tak virdohi rahane ke baavjood apane vot bank ko ek-duusare ke paas hastantarit karwaane main safal rahe
 Whereas the BJP is not able to compete with strong opponents by organizing programs like membership, mass contact, general training at organizational level
 bihar main haar ke kaarnon main bijepi abhi dwandv main fansi hui he
 The round of formal review meetings will begin after the Chhath Mahaparva to be held in Bihar
 lekin praathmik akalan main bijepi bihar kii jati kii nabj ko nahin bhaanp saki
 a party leader from Bihar says, "if a person does not have a casteable surname in his name, then he will ask the name of the father from the front to the district, block, village and continue his question till identifying the caste
 ye bihar kaa anokhaa charitra he
 "party leaders believe that in Bihar, BJP gave tickets to 40% of upper castes
" ummidavaaron ko vidhansabha siten dene main bhi chook kii
 Not only this, the election campaign started with the economic package and Digital India ended by going to the cow
 party vikaas ke apane agenda se bhatak vipaksh ke jaal main funs gai
 At the same time, the party was in the belief that 35 percent of the vote is with the grand alliance, then the remaining votes will fall in its bag
 bijepi ke ek netaa bataate hai ki party kii pahchaan hindutv se he
 But the party gets stuck on the development agenda
 unki daleel he ki sarkaar kisi kii bhi ho, vikaas to agenda hota hi he
 But a party has its own distinct feature and the BJP must now introspect whether it needs development or Hindutva? Or will there be a similar electoral loss in this duel? The contradictions that have emerged within the BJP after the Bihar election results, the modi-shah duo is again looking for the Sangh
 aise main sangh kii bhoomika madhyasth ke taur par ubharna lajimi he
 But it is a fact that even after the 2004 defeat, the Sangh took the command of a similar party
 phir bhi 10 saal bijepi centre kii satta se maharoom rahi
 Was micro management of Bihar on the lines of "shah" 1 failed management of good days, Delhi only
 lekin sari taiyaariyaan dam tod gayi
 2 4 vs 2 states: BJP won in a multi-cornered contest in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, but collapsed in a direct fight in delhi-bihar
 3 thahar gaya mahasampark abhiyaanshah kaa mahatvakankshi abhiyaan puri tarah se fail ho gaya he
 Its momentum stagnated actively in the government's campaign
 4 package-digital se gaay takprachaar abhiyaan vikaas se shuru hua or aarthik package, digital india ke raste aakhir main gaay ko gale lagaae mahila vaale vigyaapan se khatm hui
 5 Modi's defended statement on reservation against reservation has weakened the enthusiasm of forward voters which was damaging for BJP

 'daily Mail' today claimed that Dilshan, who has played 63 Tests and 188 odis for Sri Lanka, is in the eyes of the ICC due to alleged links with a bookie
 furnando ke bare main ek srilankai akhbaar ‘da island’ ne kaha ki do saal se isisi uski jaanch kar rahi he
 The Sri Lankan Cricket Board, however, strongly defended its players, saying that the charge against Dilshan was an attempt at 'character abuses', while Fernandes himself told the ICC that the bookies had approached him

 Former India team opener Gautam Gambhir has advocated the charismatic off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin to be included in the Indian team for the World Cup-2019
 gambhir kaa maananaa he ki aswin jaisaa anguliyon kaa spinner england kii paristhitiyon main kalai ke spinneron kii tulana main adhik prabhavi sabit ho saktaa he
 Gambhir, a member of the Indian team that won the World Cup in 2011, has recently retired from cricket
 gauratlab he ki aswin is samay shorter formet kii bhartiya team se baahar hai
 He played the last ODI for India in July 2017
 iske baad rist spinner yujavendra chahal or kuldeep yadav simit overon ke praaroop main bharat ke mukhya spinner ban gaye
 Both of them are likely to be a part of the Indian team in the World Cup 2019
 ran out hone par khud kii hansi udaane se nahin chuke gautam gambhir, kiya yah rochak twit
 
 
 Left-arm leg-spinner Ravindra Jadeja, along with Ashwin (ravichandran Ashwin), was also ruled out of the short-form Indian squad, but Jadeja managed to make a comeback
 gambhir (gautam Gambhir) ne yahaan ek kaarykram se itar kaha, ‘kalai ke donon spinner (kuldeep or chahal) ne pichley ek saal main acha pradarshan kiya he lekin meraa ab bhi maananaa he ki aswin aisa gendbaaj he jiske naam par hamen vichaar karnaa chahie
 i believe that a qualified spinner is always of high order whether it is wrist spinner or fingers
 ' gambhir ne is maamle main australia ke nathan leone kaa udhaaharan diya jinhone test cricket main acha pradarshan karne ke baad haal main vanade team main vaapasi kii he
 He said, 'he (leon) is probably the best spinner in the world right now and he is a finger spinner
 mujhe lagata he ki hamen antar paidaa nahin karnaa chahie ki team main kalai kaa spinner he or isliye anguliyon ke spinner ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 'gambhir said,' i believe that Ravichandran Ashwin is a player whose name should be considered because we have to keep in mind the circumstances of England at that time of the year
 wicket sapaat ho saktaa he or aise main anguliyon kaa spinner prabhavi sabit ho saktaa he
 Gautam Gambhir was angry over giving Azhar a 'special honor' at the Eden Gardens, saying - this BCCI defeat
 
 Show honesty to yourself and decide wisely
 rishta todna he yaa use kaayam rakhana he, ye faisla aapkaa hi hona chahie

 There is frequent breakup, so do not do these activities
 
 
 brallep ke baad 'move on' karne se nahin chalegaa kaam, ab 'brakeover' he zaruri
 
 
 Forget what went, it is not necessary that everyone becomes Ranjha or Majnu

 haldi ke phaayde ham aapako pehle hi bataa chuke hai
 Most people will know that turmeric is beneficial in many diseases and weakness
 lambey samay se ye dawa ke taur par istemaal hota aayaa he
 Along with being a good anti-septic, it is also anti-inflammatory
 ek ore jahaan haldi swasthya ke liye bahut phydemand he vahiin iske kuch said-effect bhi hai
 However, turmeric causes harm only if it is taken in very large quantities

 Jaitley said that religion-based reservation was opposed by former Prime Minister of this country Jawaharlal Nehru, former home minister Sardar Ballabhbhai Patel and all others because this idea would have inspired the country for another partition
 unhone kaha ki ab congress vahi kaary kar rahi he
 He said that the Congress has now started an effort to change the agenda of development and governance in the country through religion based reservation
 unhone kaha ki pehle kaha gaya ki saadhe chaar pratishat aarakshan diya jayega
 Then in Uttar Pradesh it was said that 9 percent reservation will be given and now it is being said that reservation will be given on the basis of population
 isse desh ko baantne waalon ko protsaahan milegaa
 Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Jaitley said that some backward castes of Hindus and Muslims are getting the benefit of reservation under the Mandal Commission, but now the vision document presented by promising religion-based reservation proved to be snatching the rights of those backward Will happen
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki congress isse desh main saamaajik tanaav badha kar raajnneeti karnaa chaahati he
 Congress should reconsider this document
 isse kattarpanthi takaton ko badhaava milegaa
 Jaitley said that the Congress never dealt favorably with Uttarakhand
 jab uttarakhand gathit karne kaa samay tha tab bhi congress ne saath nahin diya or jab is rajya ko aarthik rup se samrudh karne kii baat aayi to congress ne ek sajeesh ke tahat vishesh audyogic package kii samay seemaa ko varsh 2013 se ghataakar varsh 2010 kar diya
 The BJP strongly opposed this decision by supporting the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh
 unhone kaha ki iske vipareet bhaajapa ne hameshaa uttarakhand ke saath mitraapurna vyavhaar kiya he chaahe vah alag rajya gathan kaa mudda ho, chaahe aarthik vikaas ke liye vishesh package dene kii baat ho
 He said that both leadership and credibility are important facts for the governance of any state
 bhaajapa ko mukhyamantri bhuwan chandra khanduri ke netritv main chunaav ladne se in donon tathyon ke sandarbh main laabh milane vaala he kyonki khanduri netritv tathaa vishwasaneeyata ke maamle main khare utre hai

 He said that the whole country is against the Congress
 kendra main congress kii sarkaar kii koi saakh nahin he
 On the economic front, this government has failed
 bhrashtachar ke naye aayam ubharkar saamne aaye hai
 He said that on the other hand, the tenure of the BJP government in Uttarakhand has been very good
 swasthya chikitsa sevaaon kaa acha vikaas hua he
 He said that the party will get political benefit due to Khanduri being honest and this subject will also emerge strongly in the entire country

 The pace of the country's fastest growing automobile industry has been broken at times
 gharelu maang main giravat kii vajah se vaahanon or khaskar yatri vaahanon kii bikri 19 saal ke sabase nichle str tak pahunch gai he
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently said that now Ola, Uber services are cheap, especially young people are not wanting to buy cars
 haalanki, bhartiya rigerv bank (RBI) ke ek research se yah baat saamne ai he ki kaaron kii bikri main giravat kii sabase badi vajah petrol-dijal kii keemton main lagaataar ho rahaa ijapha he
 What RBI says in its research paper, RBI said, 'we found that at macro level, changes in fuel prices have negatively impacted automobile sales, and there is a huge impact of debt (difficulty in getting loan)
 Don't see apane vishleshan ke aadhaar par hamane yah paaya ki haal kii susti ko oonchi eendhan keemton ke aadhaar par behatar samajha ja saktaa he
 'now the decline in taxi registration is true that in the last few years, affordable taxi aggregator services like Ola, Uber have seen tremendous growth in many cities across the country
 in sevaaon ke vistaar kii vajah se hi shuruaati kai varshon main taxi registration main kaaphi badhat hui
 But from the year 2016, taxi registrations started to fall partially, this could be due to the maturity of these services and filling of taxi supply
 iske baad se kul four whealer bazaar main kareeb 6 fisadi hissaa taxi registration kaa he or pichley do saal main kaaron kii bikri main jo giravat ai he, uski kuch had tak vajah yah bhi he
 City taxi services have been popular in the metro cities of India even before, but there was a real revolution in the year 2010 when Ola started an app based taxi service
 iske baad saal 2013 main america company ubar ne bhi bharat main isi tarah kii seva shuru kii
 According to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), demand for passenger cars has dropped by about one-third in the last two years
 pichley paanch saal (vitt varsh 2013-14 se vitt varsh 2018-19) main yatri kaaron kii gharelu bikri main ausatan salanaa growth mahaj saat fisadi rahi he
 The year 2017-18 has been an exception in this case, when sales of vehicles grew by 14 per cent
 may, 2019 main kaaron kii bikri main 26 fisadi kii giravat hui he
 Not only this, 23 of the total vehicle sales in August
 55 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 This is also a reason, apart from following the BS-IV standard, sales of cars have also been hurt
 puure desh main 1, april 2017 se BS-IV lagu he or isamen ek badi chalaang lagaate hue april 2020 se BS-VI maanak lagu kiya jayega
 To improve the environment in the cities and towns of the country, BS ie Bharat Stage standard was implemented

 Sanchar Bhawan situated on Parliament Street in New Delhi has witnessed some of the most unethical occasions in the country's economic journey
 jab desh kaa telecom kshetra kangaaroon kii tarah oonchi chalaangen bhar rahaa tha, tab mantralay main ek jatke main kai mantri aae or gaye
 Current Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad spoke with Associate Editor Shweta Punj about the reluctance of telecom companies to invest in infrastructure and improve the quality of services and did not hide their displeasure
 baatcheet ke kuch anshatkol draps ke bare main aap kaaphi mukhar rahe hai
 What is happening in your opinion, why do we have to see such a decline? My dual goals as a minister are the growth of the telecom sector and satisfactory service to customers
 radiation ke kathith nuksandaayak asar ke puure mudde par main saarvajanik taur par uksaane vaale andaaj main bolta rahaa hum
 i have been saying that there is no clear medical evidence about the after-effects
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan (dablyuechao) iskaa adhyayan kar chukaa he
 i say, if anyone is willing to show me unintentional concrete evidence, i am ready to consider it as a minister
 radiation to hameshaa hoga
 If you go for X-rays, there will be radiation
 aap apana mobile chaalu karen to radiation hoga
 If you turn on your microwave, there will be radiation
 aap airport jaaen to vahaan radiation he
 The issue is whether it is dangerous, what is not
 isliye maine logon se apil kii he ki kol drops ke khilaaf shikaayatein or tower radiation ke khilaaf abhiyaan saath-saath nahin chal sakate
 i have asked the Telecom Secretary to talk to the Ministry of Urban Development to allow BTS (base transmission station) to be installed in government premises
 main sabhi mukhyamantriyon ko likhane or unase nishpaksh tareeke se sahi niti banane ke liye kehane kaa prastaav karata hum
 So, i am doing my job as a minister, but as far as strengthening the system is concerned, it is their (telecom companies) job
 main bilkul saaf taur par kahana chaahunga ki unhen apni vyavasthaaon ko majboot banane ke liye or zyada karne kii darkaar he
 i will appeal to the people and also to the Resident Welfare Associations that it is not fair to over-emphasize an alleged apprehension
 to, matlab yah ki telecom companiyaan buniyadi dhaanche main paryaapt nivesh nahin kar rahi hai
 i will not fall into the game of accusation
 main unase sirf itnaa aagrah kar rahaa hum ki kol drops kii jaruri samasya se nibatane ke liye unhen sabase pehle apane buniyadi dhaanche ko majboot bananaa hoga
 The talk is straightforward and flat
 buniyadi dhaancha ahm he
 And i would also request the state governments to look at the issue of BTS as part of infrastructure
 main apni taraf se chaar kadam zyada chalane ko taiyaar hum or aisa hi unhen bhi karnaa chahie
 Indian telecom companies are doing much less than their average counterparts in the rest of the world on average
 aapaki raay kya he?hamane chaar band main 470 megahertz pesh kiye the or 450 megahertz bik gaye
 The work of connecting and joining the defense spectrum is already underway
 or jitna bhi spectrum mukt kiya ja saktaa he, uplabdh karavaaya jayega
 But i do not understand the whole argument that unless there is more spectrum, we will not make the system stronger
 haal hi ke pichley daur main aapako spectrum mil hi chukaa he, aap ise or majboot banaaie
 Telecom companies need to look within themselves
 gunvattta ke muddon ko sulajhane ke liye kya doorsanchaar niamak tri ko apni taraf se zyada bad-chadhakar bhoomika nahin nibhaani chahie?hamane jarurat ke mutabik protsaahan yaa hatotsahit karne kii ek vyavastha banane ke bare main niamak se pehle hi ek report aupchaarik taur par maangi he
 The spectrum is divided into so many potentials
 antariksh, raksha, police
 It seems that the telecom department is having to struggle a lot to gain more spectrum
 aapako aitihaasik nazariye se dekhnaa hoga
 You did not need spectrum for landline, these were all based on cable
 spectrum kii ahmiyat tabhi saamne ai jab mobile phone laanch kiye gaye, isliye spectrum kaa istemaal paramparaagat taur par raksha kshetra main hi kiya ja rahaa tha
 After that, some degree was being done in space and police
 spectrum par asli dabaav mobile phone kaa chalan badaae ke baad hi itnaa zyada padaa
 The issue of adding and merging them is also pending in the Ministry of Defense for a long time
 kya or spectrum kii nilaamee kii jaaegi?haa, hamaare paas or spectrum maujuud he, ham nilaamee karenge
 But this constant hysteria about the lack of spectrum, i do not like
 system ko majboot nahin banane ke bahaane kii tarah iskaa istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa

 aaj bhi hamaare samaaj main kai chijen ling ke aadhaar par tay hoti hai
 While boys get more support from home family, girls are considered as secondary
 mahilaon ko kamjor samajha jaataa he or purushon ke liye 'mard ko dard nahin hota' jaisi sangya di jaati he
 Men are sent to earn outside, while women are considered domestic
 lekin samaaj main kai purush aise bhi hai jinhen kichan ke kaam karnaa, saaf-safai karnaa acha lagata he lekin saamaajik dabaav main ve in baton ko maanane se inkaar kar dete hai
 Let's know those 6 big things that men do but refuse to accept
 1
 It has become an undisclosed rule that men earn more than women
 har santhaan main mahilaon or purushon ke vetan main fark dekhne ko miltaa he
 However, there are times in modern times that a wife starts earning more than her husband
 isse purushon ke andar ek asahajata aa jaati he
 Although many people refuse to believe it
 2
 There is a belief in the society about cooking that cooking is the work of women whereas it is not
 naa to ye sirf mahilaon kaa kaam he naa hi sabhi mahilaon ko khaanaa bananaa acha lagata he
 There are many men who love to cook and they also help their wife in the kitchen
 haalanki saamaajik dabaav ke chakkar main ve maanane se inkaar karte hai ki unhen kichan main kaam karnaa acha lagata he
 3
 kehete hai ki 'mard ko dard nahin hota' lekin aisa bilkul galat he
 This is just a matter of saying
 mardon ko bhi samaan rup se dard hota he
 Talking about being emotional, many boys are more emotional than girls
 haalanki ye baat purush sweekaar karne se inkaar karte hai
 Video game: Your child is playing with 'fire'! 4
 ladki agar apane kisi purush dost kii tarif apane pati yaa boyfriend ke saamne baar-baar karti he to isse unhen lagata he ki unki tulana ho rahi he
 This makes every man jealous
 haalanki ise maanane se ve inkaar karte hai
 5
 hamane suna he ki ladakiyon kaa dhyaan isi par rahata he ki kis ladki ne koun sa mek-ap kiya he yaa phir kis ladki ne koun si dress pahani he
 But boys also do this
 kai ladke duusare ladakon kaa fishan sens dekhnaa pasand karte hai
 If liked, they do not hesitate to adopt it either
 haalanki ye baat koi maanata nahin he
 These 8 main reasons for marriage breakdown! 6
 sajnaa sanvarna ladakiyon ko hi nahin ladakon ko bhi bahut pasand hota he
 But often the boys refuse to accept this

 ab ladakh ke zanskar ilaake main ek nadi ke rukne se bani jhil ke fatne kii ashanka hamen daraa rahi he, lekin aise maamalon main agar ham itihaas main thodaa or jhankkar dekhen, to hamen apane hi desh main kuch badi nazir mil jaaengi
 One such interesting incident is 125 years old
 uttarakhand ke chamoli zile main alaknanda nadi kii ek sahaayak nadi he virahi ganga
 a hundred and fifty years ago in July 1893, a hill near the river fell into the river
 barsaat ke din the or is bhuskhalan ne tej raftaar se bahati nadi kaa rasta roak diya
 As soon as the villagers of this incident gave it to the British officials, they got into action
 qareeb paune do sau kilometre dur haridwar ke raywala main suparintending ejeeniyar leftinent karnal pulford ne fouran apane ejeeniyar ko maukey par bheja
 After taking stock of the situation, it was estimated that it may take a year to fill the lake, but after that if the lake is torn, it can have terrible consequences
 is jhil ko gauna taal naam diya gaya
 Take karnal pulford ne apane staff ke takanicianon ko jhil par hi tainaat kar diya
 a line of twenty-two hundred kilometers long telegraph was laid down from this lake to Raiwala
 wo telegraph yani taar jo pichley saal dam tod chukaa he
 The wires of this telegraph line were planted on trees in the jungles of the mountains
 lagaataar jhil kii monitoring chalati rahi
 Meanwhile, the lake became three kilometers long
 angrezon ne paas hi ek guest house bana diya, jahaan se puri jhil kaa nazaaraa dikhataa tha
 Boating and fishing also started in the lake
 ye jhil bhuvaigyanikon ke liye bhi kutuhal kaa vishay rahi
 The largest British scientists of that era arrived to take stock of the situation
 saal bhar baad 15 agast, 1894 ke aasapaas is jhil ke fatne kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya
 In due course of time, the British started evacuating people from the lowlands
 logon ko surakshit jagahon par bhej diya gaya
 On the way, some bridges on the Alaknanda River were removed
 baari barsaat ke bich 27 agast 1894 ko ye badi jhil phooti or wo chamoli, rudraprayag, srinagar main tabaahi machaati hui rishikesh, haridwar kii ore badi
 The upper Ganga was filled with canal silt till Roorkee
 is tabaahi ko koi nahin roak saktaa tha, lekin khaas baat ye rahi ki is tabaahi main ek bhi insaan kii maut nahin hui
 85 years later, when this lake burst again in 1970, there was a huge destruction of Jan Dhan
 to saafe ho jaataa he ki sava sau saal pehle 1894 main angrezon ke daur main hui wo kavayad apane aap main aapadaa prabandhan kii kitni badi auki aitihaasik misaal he
 The geologists and disaster management gurus of the country and abroad still remember that effort with great respect, but for our governments, this incident is only a mention in the files, no one has been informed to take a lesson from it

 intervyuu main unase usee tarah ke sawaal puche gaye jo aamtaur par kisi bhi intervyuu main puche jate hai
 Natarajan, who has been in the Tata group for 30 years, now asked him to save the reputation of the group, 'you don't have experience in handling steel, auto sector
 aise main agar ham aapako ye jimmedaari dete hai to aap kaise sambhaal paaenge?', iske jawaab main unhone kaha, 'akele main sab nahin sambhaal saktaa

 Addressing the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly, Patil said that Chhattisgarh is facing the problem of Naxalism in the same way as some other states
 pichley kuch samay ke dauraan naksalwadi hinsa kii kai durbhagyapurna ghatnaayen saamne ai hai, jinamein bahut si amuly jane gai hai
 Everyone has to remember that peace is necessary for the development of the country and it is very important to maintain it

 It only gives destruction and suffering
 raashtrapati ne kaha ki samasya kitni bhi badi ho use vaartalap or samvaad dwaara suljhaayaa ja saktaa he

 In the true sense of development, the nation should be prosperous, its citizens should be wise and educated, brotherhood and good governance in the country and the benefits of progress should reach every section of the society and especially the deprived people
 saath hi santulit pragati ho or kalyaan kaaryakramon kaa laabh sabhi tak pahunche
 This was the dream of Mahatma Gandhi and this should be our effort as well

 In Sarwar village near Ajmer town of Ajmer, Rajasthan, there was a dispute with the dominant castes over the removal of Bindori (procession) of a Dalit community's youth
 gaanv ke kuch dabangon kii dambagai ke kaaran pehle ghodi par bindori nahin nikaalane di gai
 In Rajasthan, the incidents of beating the Dalit castes often occur when the Dalits are seated on a mare
 dalitbairava samaaj ke logon ne jila colector ko shikaayat kii
 After this, police and administrative officers came into action
 colector ke nirdesh par nasirabad or kishangarh upkhand adhikari, tehseeldaar, police upaadheekshak sahit do thanon kii police maukey par pahunchi
 After this, the evacuation of the Dalit bride could be done peacefully
 sarwar nivasee pradhan bairava kaa vivaah kaarykram ke anusaar ghodi par bindori nikaalane lage
 It is alleged that since the commencement of the marriage program, the family was being forced by some domineering people not to take out Bindori
 gaanv ke kuch dabangon ne vivaad karte hue ghodi par bindori nahin nikaalane di
 On this, there was anger among the people of Dalit society
 bairava samaaj ke logon ne rosh jataate hue jila colector ko shikaayat kar police suraksha kii guhaar lagaai
 Taking immediate action, the Collector sent police and administrative officials to Sarwar village
 is par kishangarh upkhand adhikari ashok kumaar choudhary, sarwar upkhand adhikari esen negi, kishangarh police upaadheekshak omprakash kilania, nasirabad upaadheekshak motaaraam beniwal, arai tehseeldaar ramkishor meena, arai thanaprabharee tejaraam jat, borada thanaprabharee ramnarayan taakhar may police japta sarwar pahunche
 In the presence of police administration here, Bindori was peacefully taken out on the mare of the groom of the Dalit community
 iske baad duulhaa or baraat ravaanaa ho gai
 Pradhan Bairava, the groom of the Dalit family, thanked the administration after taking out Bindouri on the mare in the presence of administrative officials
 gwalior rajgaraane kii beti or dhaulpur ke shahi parivaar kii bahu va rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje sindhiya ke vyaktitv or vyavhaar ko lekar aksar charchaa rahati he
 Despite being the people's representative, the reach of both common and special class to Vasundhara Raje is considered to be crooked
 vipaksh jahaan un par abhimaani hone ke aarope lagaataa rahata he, vahiin kai baar bhartiya janata party ke andar se hi unke khilaaf naaraazgi ke swar bhi sunne ko milte hai
 In such a situation now that Rajasthan is ready for assembly elections once again, questions are arising that the resentment of leaders towards Vasundhara Raje should not become harmful for the Bharatiya Janata Party
 is kadi main rajasthanbijepike kuch netaa aise bhi hai jinhone vasundhara raaje ke aacharan kii aalochana karte hue party se naata tod liya he
 These include prominent names like Ghanshyamatiwadi, Manvendra Singh and hanumanbeniwal
 jabaki bijepi ke varisht netaa rahe or purv mukhyamantri bhaerosingh shekhavat ke damaad narpat rajvi ne party main rahete hue hi vasundhara sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha khol rakhaa he
 Ghanshyam Tiwadi, Ghanshyam Tiwari was considered one of the stalwarts of the BJP
 vah bhaironsingh shekhavat sarkaar main urja mantri rahe hai, lekin vasundhara sarkaar se unke vaicharik matbhed saarvajanik taur par dekhne-sunne ko mili
 He was elected 6 times MLA, out of which he also got the opportunity to become a minister twice
 2013 main hue vidhansabha chunaavon main sarvaadhik maton se jeet darj karne vaale tiwadi ko ummid thi ki vasundhara raaje unhen mantrimandal main nishchit rup se shaamil karengi, lekin aisa hua nahin
 After this he started making rhetoric against Vasundhara
 bijepi se alag hokar tiwadi ne 'bharat vahini' naam se raajnneetik dal kaa gathan kar liya he, jise chunaav ayog se bhi manyata mil gai he
 However, he has made his son Akhilesh the founder and president of the party
 tiwadi vidhansabha kii sabhi siton par chunaav ladane kaa aahvaan kar chuke hai or saath hi vah gaiyr bijepi-congress morcha gathit karne kii bhi koshish main jute hue hai
 Manvendra Singh: Manvendra Singh, son of senior BJP leader and Union Minister Jaswant Singh, has also split from the Bharatiya Janata Party
 unhone sitambar ke aakhri hafte main barmer ke pachapadara main swabhimaan raily yojit kii or bijepi se apane parivaar kaa chaar dashak purana rishta todane kaa elaan kar diya
 Manvendra Singh even said that 'lotus flower was a big mistake'
 maanavendra ke pita jaswant singh or siem vasundhara raaje ke bich pehle kaaphi achche sambandh the, lekin pichley saat-aath saal main donon ke bich duuri paidaa ho gai
 The result of this was that instead of giving ticket to Jaswant Singh from Barmer in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Colonel Sonaram Chaudhary was fielded
 jaswant kaa tikat katane ke peeche vasundhara raaje ko hi mukhya kaaran mana gaya
 Jaswant Singh contested independently after not getting a ticket from BJP
 modi lahar ke baavjood jaswant singh 4 lakh se zyada vot paane main kaamyaab rahe, lekin jeet nahin pie
 Manvendra was part of the BJP, but refused to campaign against his father and in favor of BJP candidate Sonaram Chaudhary
 iske baad maanavendra ko bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini se baahar karne ke saath-saath party se nikaal diya gaya
 He did not even attend Vasundhara Raje's Gaurav Yatra before leaving the BJP
 yahaan tak ki maanavendra ne apane vidhansabha kshetra shiv main vasundhara raaje kii gaurav yatra karaane se bhi inkaar kar diya
 Can Manvendra Singh's loss hurt BJP in elections? On this question, political analysts believe that if Manvendrakangress takes a break, the party in Marwar can benefit and the BJP may suffer
 aisa isliye kyonki yahaan rajput samaaj kaa prabhutv he or dashakon se raajnneeti main sakriy jaswant singh or unke parivaar kaa yahaan khaasaa asar he
 Narpat Singh Rajvi, son-in-law of former Vice President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and BJP MLA Narpat Singh Rajvi, has also opened a front against the leaders of his own party
 unhone haal hi main vasundhara raaje ko ek chitthee likhakar bataaya ki jaipur ke bijepi netaa bhrashtachar main lipt hai
 These allegations of Narpat have given a big chance to the Congress and party state president Sachin Pilot is accusing BJP of institutional corruption
 narpat ke aaropon par party ko baqayada safai deni padi or netaaon ne unase mulaakaat bhi kii
 However, Narpat Singh Rajvi has not taken any decision to leave the BJP or join the Congress
 lekin unke ye virdohi swar bijepi ke liye musiibat kaa sabab ban rahe hai
 Hanuman Beniwal Hanuman Beniwal contested the 2008 assembly election on a BJP ticket and won
 iske baad 2013 ke chunaav se pehle unhone bijepi ke kai bade netaaon ke khilaaf bayaanbaji kii
 Beniwal accused big leaders like Vasundhara Raje and Rajendra Rathore of corruption
 iske baad unhen party se nishkasit kar diya gaya
 He contested from Bhimsar seat as an independent candidate and won
 nagaur jile se taalluk rakhane vaale beniwal rajya ke bade jat netaa ke taur par ubhare hai
 Amid resentment from the BJP, he is trying to unite the Jat community in view of the upcoming election
 saath hi ghanashyam tiwadi ke saath gathjod kii bhi baat chal rahi he
 If such equations are formed or if these leaders and parties oppose BJP in elections then it can be difficult for them
 bataa den ki nagaur, sikar, jhunjhanu, bharatpur or jodhpur ko jat belt kaha jaataa he or jat samudaay kaa rajya kii kareeb 60 siton par prabhaav he
 The political equation of the party in the state seems to be deteriorating with the leaders who rebel against the BJP
 ghanashyam tiwadi brahman netaa hai, jabaki maanavendra singh or narpat singh rajvi rajput samudaay se aate hai
 At the same time, Hanuman Beniwal belongs to the Jat community
 rajasthan kii raajnneeti main in teenon samaaj kaa kaa acha khaasaa asar he
 In such a situation, their alliance and support or opposition can become a major obstacle for the BJP to return to power
 aise main in chaaron netaaon par pradesh ke logon kii najar he

 modi sarkaar ek saath teen talaak ko gaiyr kanoonee or gaiyr jamaanti aparaadh banane vaale bill ko loksabhaa se paarit karaane ke baad ab isko mangalvaar ko rajyasabha main pesh karegi
 However, it will not be easy for the government to pass this bill from Rajya Sabha
 is dauraan sarkaar or vipakshi dal aamane-saamne ho sakate hai
 The real test of the Modi government on the Muslim Women (protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill-2017 will be in the Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha main is bill kaa rasta utana aasaan nahin he, jitna aasaan loksabhaa main tha
 Therefore, the Central Government has made complete preparations on its behalf and the opposition parties have also been talked about
 sabase badi baat yah he ki loksabhaa main sarkaar ke paas jabardast bahumat tha, jiske dam par usne asaduddin ovaisi samet ikkaa-dukka saansadon ke virodh ko aasaani se darkinar kar diya
 However, the government does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha and a lot will depend on what is the stand of the Congress on this issue? At the same time, the opposition parties are scheduled to meet on Tuesday morning to decide on the bill further
 rahul gandhi kii chhavi kii chintaa se bijepi ko phaaydasarkaar kuch had tak is baat se raahat mahasoos kar rahi he ki gujarat chunaav main soft hindutv kaa rasta apnaane se congress ko phayda hua he or vah teen talaak bill ko rokkar apane is image ko dharashayi nahin karnaa chaahegi
 When this bill was passed in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi was not present in the House
 mana ja rahaa he ki teen talaak bill kaa virodh karke rahul gandhi apni chhavi ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaana chaahate hai
 On the backfoot on the bill, the Congress has also been very aggressive during the debate on the triple talaq bill, in the Lok Sabha, the Congress has repeatedly attacked the Shahbano case and its leaders have to listen to it, since then the Congress has been very aggressive on the triple talaq
 Does not appear to be in a state of adoption
 congress bill ko pravar samit ke paas bhejne kii karegi mangain sabake baavjood ho saktaa he ki congress is bill se turant teen talaak ko gaiyr jamaanti banane ke praavdhaan ko hataane par jor daale
 Even during the debate in Lok Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge of Congress had said this, but in the Rajya Sabha, it may be that the Congress should insist that this bill should be sent to the select committee
 bill par vipakshi dalon kaa yah he tarkloksabhaa main bahes ke dauraan congress samet kai vipakshi partiyon kaa yah tark tha ki agar teen talaak kii vajah se pati ko jail bhej diya jayega, to bivi ko guzaara bhatta mil paanaa behad mushkil hoga, kyonki jail main band shuhar kisi bhi haalat main apni bivi ko guzaara bhatta nahin de paaegaa
 During this time it was also argued that sending Shauhar to jail will leave no hope of reconciliation
 is satr main paarit karnaa ho saktaa he mushkilrajyasabha main bhi koi party sidhe-sidhe teen talaak kaa samarthan karke mahila virdohi to kahlaana pasand nahin karegi, lekin is bill ke praavdhaanon main kuch nuks nikaalkar isamen sanshodhan karne ko kahegi
 However, the problem of the government is that if any amendment is approved in this bill, then it will have to be sent to the Lok Sabha to get it passed again
 vahiin, sheetakaaleen satr paanch janvari ko khatm ho rahaa he
 Therefore, the government does not have much time, but if the bill goes to the select committee of the upper house, then this bill will not be passed by Parliament in this session
 rajyasabha main aisi he sattarudh dal kii halatrajyasabha main bijepi kaa bahumat nahin he
 In such a situation, there is a need for other parties to pass the bill
 245 sadasyeey rajyasabha main rajg ke 88 saansad (bijepi ke 57 saansad sahit), congress ke 57, sapa ke 18, BJD ke 8 saansad, AIADMK ke 13, trinmul congress ke 12 or NCP ke 5 saansad hai
 Even if the government joins all its allies, the support of at least 35 more mps will be needed to get the bill passed
 is bill kaa biju janata dal (BJD), AIADMK, sapa or trinmul congress samet kai raajnneetik partiyaan virodh kar rahi hai
 The government brought the bill in a hurry: Sitaram Yechury, general secretary of the yechurymarxist Communist Party, said that his party opposes triple talaq and wants to end it, but a criminal aspect has been added to the bill
 musalamaanon main vivaah ek civil qaraar he or nayaa kanoon isamen ek aapraadhik pahalu jod rahaa he, joki galat he
 He said, "BJP has brought this bill in a hurry for political gains and communal polarization
 "SC ne sarkaar ko kanoon banane ke liye diya tha 6 maah kaa samaysupreme court teen talaak yani talaak-e-biddat ko pehle hi asanvaidhanik qaraar de chuki he
 On August 22, a five-judge bench of the apex court, by majority, declared the three divorces to be unconstitutional and illegal
 saath hi modi sarkaar se muslim mahilaon ke adhikaron kii raksha ke liye kanoon banane ko kaha tha
 During the discussion on triple talaq bill in Lok Sabha, the government also cited the decision of the Supreme Court
 aisa hoga teen talaak bilimodi sarkaar 'muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan) vidheyak-2017' naam se is vidheyak ko laai he
 This law will apply only to triple talaq (INSTANT TALAQ, i
e
, divorce-e-biddat)
 is kanoon ke baad koi bhi muslim purush agar apni bibi ko teen talaak degaa, to wo gaiyr-kanoonee hoga
 Henceforth, three divorces granted in any form, whether oral or written and or through message, will be invalid
 jo bhi teen talaak degaa, usko teen saal kii sajaa or jurmaana ho saktaa he yani teen talaak dena gaiyr-jamaanti or sangyeya ( Cognizable) aparaadh hoga
 In this the magistrate will decide how much penalty will be there
 piem narendra modi ne teen talaak par kanoon banane ke liye ek mantri samooh banaaya tha, jisamen rajnath singh, arun jetali, sushamaa swaraj, ravishankar prasad, peepi choudhary or jitendra singh shaamil the
 These are the provisions in the triple talaq bill- it would be illegal to say a triple talaq (speaking, writing or through electronic means like email, SMS and whatsapp) simultaneously
 - aisa karne vaale pati ko teen saal ke karawas kii sajaa ho sakati he
 This would be considered a non-bailable and cognizable offense
 - yah kanoon sirf 'talaak e biddat' yani ek saath teen baar talaak bolne par lagu hoga
 - The victim of divorce can appeal to the Magistrate seeking alimony for himself and minor children
 - peedit mahila magistrate se naaballig bacchon ke sangrakshan kaa bhi anurodh kar sakati he
 The magistrate will take a final decision on the issue
 - yah prastaavit kanoon jammu-kashmir ko chhodkar puure desh main lagu hoga he

 According to a research conducted on adolescents, while girls' attachment to their mother may be helpful in reducing the negative effects of television on their sexual behaviors, there is a possibility of negative effects in boys
 research kii kasuti par rishton kaa sach
 
 
 What is there in 'kamasutra' 
 
 belgium main luven catholic vishvavidhyalay ke laura vandenboch or steve igarmont dwaara kiye gaye adhyayan ke mutabik yon drushtikon par dikhaae jane vaale televijan kaaryakramon kaa asar ling par nirbhar hota he

 Vandenbauch and Igeramont included 1,026 adolescents aged 16 from nine Belgian schools in their survey
 catholic vishvavidhyalay ke ek bayaan ke mutabik shodhakartaaon ne kishoron main yon ke prati unke manoranjak vyavhaar kaa pareekshan kiya
 For example, teenagers' commitment to their partner, their occasional sexual relationships, their attitudes to the traditional gender norms, their time to watch television a week and their attachment to their mother
 Tried to know
 adhyayan main paaya gaya ki kishor ek saptaah main ausatan 23 ghante televijan dekhte hai or iske liye ek din main teen ghante se adhik samay dete hai
 All the boys and girls said that their attachment to the mother is gratifying
 jaahir he ki jitna televijan dekhne kaa str badhata he vishesh rup se ladakon main yon ke prati manoranjak drushtikon utana hi badhata he or isse purushon kii yon jarurat badhati he va unamem prabhutv se sambandhit roodhiwaadita aati he

 yon ke prati manoranjak rukh or purushon ke yon sambandhi sanak ke bare main dikhaae jane vaale nakaaratmak televijan kaaryakramon kaa prabhaav ladakiyon par kam hota he
 Conversely, the deeper attachment of boys to their mother, the greater the impact of such negative television programs on them

 Kejriwal had opened a front against the Delhi Police and the Home Ministry over the gang rape of a foreign woman in Connaught Place, Delhi
 us vakt kejariwal kaa soshal media par jamkar majaak uda tha
 The period was so bad for Kejriwal that he even called himself an 'anarchist'
 khayr aaj is baat kii charchaa isliye kyonki aaj ek or siem ne apane hi shasankaal main anshan kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 He is none other than the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan surrounded by the agitation of the farmers' movement
 shivaraj singh chouhan ne shuukravaar shaam ghoshnaa kii ki ve shanivaar se tab tak anshan par rahenge jab tak kisaan andolan shant nahin ho jaataa or anischitkaaleen anshan karuunga
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan will fast in BHEL Dussehra ground of Bhopal
 unhone bataaya ki ve is dauraan naa ballab bhawan main koi kaam karenge or naa hi siem house se, apane kaam bhi ve dashahra maidan se hi karenge
 In his statement, Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that no work of the state will stop during my fast
 sarkaar ke saare kaam dashahra maidan se hi nipataae jaaenge
 During my fast, all the avenues of discussion with the farmers will be open
 kisaan andolan madhya pradesh main charam par he
 Opposition parties are also trying to cash in on it
 aise main mukhyamantri kaa yah faisla ajeebogareeb he
 According to political experts, this is only a means to pull out the massacre that arose after the Mandsaur violence
 shivaraj singh chouhan apane anshan se kya sabit kar pate hai, usase kya hasil hota he yah to vakt hi batayega lekin, madhya pradesh ke kuch prabud virgon ke baatcheet ke aadhaar par shivaraj ke is 'anshan card' se kuch khaas phayda hota najar nahin aata
 These could be the possible consequences of the 'fast card' - and the Congress will be aggressive
 This has been done by the Congress immediately after Shivraj's announcement
 congress ne ise nautanki bataaya he
 State Congress President Arun Yadav said that instead of removing the problems of the farmers, the Chief Minister is doing a gimmick of fasting
 agar unako kuch karnaa hi he to kisaanon ke bich jaakar unke dukh dard ko dur karen
 The Leader of Opposition reacted strongly, saying, "once more, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan was going to sit in the BHEL Dussehra ground in 2011 to do a similar gimmick
 tab sanvaidhanik sankat khadaa hone par unhone apana kadam waapas khinch liya tha, tab tak unki nautanki kii vyavastha par sarkaar ke pachaas lakh rupee kharch ho chuke the
 "- The situation should not worsen elsewhere, the peasant movement in the state is at its peak
 hinsa kii aag rajya kii rajdhani bhopal tak pahunch chuki he
 In such a situation, the Chief Minister himself going on hunger strike can also make the situation a bit uncontrollable
 netaa pratipaksh ne bhi 2011 kii ghatana yaad dilaai he jab 'sanvaidhanik sankat' aa khadaa hua tha
 - The farmers may be soft, the Chief Minister of the state of Madhya Pradesh is likely to stop the peasant movement because of the farmers themselves sitting on hunger strike
 logon main shivaraj singh chouhan kii chhavi kaaphi behatar he
 In such a case, in his Friday press conference, it can prove beneficial in reducing the heat of fire
 - kamjor ho sakati he shivaraj kii chhavimadhya pradesh kii siem kursi par sabase zyada samay tak kabiz rahane kaa record shivaraj singh kaaphi pehle hi bana chuke hai
 Let me tell you that he has taken power of Madhya Pradesh thrice in a row
 agle saal phir chunaav hone hai
 In such a situation, the agitation for Shivraj Singh Chauhan can be very heavy
 apane aap ko kisaan hitaishi bataane vaale shivaraj singh chouhan kaa yah 'anshan card' usee chhavi ko bachaane kii hi koshish he
 The BJP has the scope of damage in all the states, the bullets and lathis on the farmers in Mandasour are not going to stop in the border of Madhya Pradesh alone
 jaahir he ki yah andolan bijepi ko har rajya main chunauti degaa
 The opposition party will target the Modi government as well as the BJP by making it an issue

 input: IANS Chinese technology company Xiaomi has launched its first offline retail store Mi Home in India
 sabase pehle ise bangaloru main shuru kiya gaya he or company agle 2 saalon main bharat main 200 ofline store kholegi
 It will be launched first from metro cities like Delhi and Mumbai
 public ke liye ise 20 may se kholaa jayega or iske liye pre booking karai jaaegi
 During the launch of Mi Hai's special features, Manu Kumar Jain, Vice President and Managing Director of Xiaomi has said that there is a reason behind calling it Mi Home rather than Mi Store
 unhone kaha ki is store par kisi bhi graahak se yah nahin puchha jayega ki wo dukaan kyon aayaa he
 There will be no gate in Mi Home and people can come and see the products for hours and use them
 unhone china ke Mi Home kaa udhaaharan dete hue bataaya ki vahaan ke kuch store par graahak aakar chaaval tak banaate hai or bachche 6 ghanton tak game khelte rahete hai
 Apart from this, he has also said that by coming to this store, he can use wifi, drink coffee and will not disturb anyone
 haalanki bharat main Mi Home main zyada products nahin he jitne china main hai
 Here customers will get to buy smartphones and some accessories to air purifiers
 kya Mi Home se market share badhegaa?online ke baad ab company kii ofline stretiji ke iske market share main ijapha kaa kaaran banegi
 The answer is clear, it will happen if availability increases
 online kii tarah agar ofline store main bhi agar out of stock hone lage to shaayad company ko koi khaas phayda na ho
 Increase in product range will be increased when the company increases the scope of the store
 china or duusare desh ke Mi Home main smartphone or chand accessories ke alaava kai products milte hai
 But new products have not been announced for the Indian market at the moment
 bharat main kam products laane ke peeche kii ek vajah yah bhi he ki company ke kai saamaan jaise water purifire bhartiya graahak ke hisaab se nahin banaae gaye hai isliye inhen bharat main bechnaa mushkil sabit ho saktaa he
 This Mi Home is quite small in terms of the company's first Mi offline store space
 jaahir he isamen beche jane vaale products bhi limited honge
 Significantly, Xiaomi does not have a license to open its retail store in India
 haalanki company ne iske liye aavedan kiya he
 At present, the company has started Mi Home which will work under the franchise, which will be run indirectly only by Xiaomi
 dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki kaise company is store ke sahare bharat main chinicompaniyon- vivo or oppo ko takkardetii hai
 Because if we talk about the presence of offline, then Vivo and Oppo are constantly outperforming each other by aggressive marketing

 The voice recorded by Begum Akhtar at the very earliest stages of voice recording are those whose countless moments of love kept her from falling prey to feticide
 unki gayaki sukun or maraham kaa paryaay lagati he
 Sometimes it is a surprise that if Akhtari Bai was not there, what would the loved ones do and where did they go
 rap or rimix ke jamaane main farvari kii gunguni dhoop kii tarah vah har baar hamaari samvednaa ke sookshm taron ko kamyaabi se sahalaati hai
 'every evening used to live up to the expectations, today there is something that came crying in the evening
 ' ham begum akhtar ko sunate rahe or beeti hui kahaniyaan smriti ke sahil par laut-laut aati raheen
 Legendary poet Kaifi Azmi had said about him, 'ghazals have two meanings, the first being Ghazal and the second is Begum Akhtar
 ' 'mallika-e-ghazal'padmabhushan begum akhtar kaa aaj janmdin he
 If he is not remembered on this occasion in the gospel of his ghazals, then God will swear to him
 shakeel badayunni kii likhi 'i muhabbat tere anjaam pe ronaa aayaa' akhtari bai kii sabase mashhoor gajalon main sehai
 On October 7, 1914, that voice was born into an aristocratic family living in Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh
 maa-baap ne bade pyaar se naam rakhaa, 'bibbi'
 Bibby fell in love with music at the age of 7, when she heard a song by theater actress Chanda
 us jamaane ke mashhoor sangeet ustad ata mohammad khan, abdul vaahid khan or patiala gharaane ke ustad jhande khan se unhen shastreey sangeet kii diksha dilaai gai
 Listen, 1930 was the real version of 'hamari Atariya Par Aao Sanwariya' in the sound voice of Begum Akhtar
 bibbi ab akhtari ho gai thim
 At the age of 15, when she presented the first Kalam on the stage, Sarojini Naidu, the famous poetess sitting in front, floated and was happy and presented her a sari
 is ghazal ke bol the, 'tuune boote e harjaai tuune boote harjaai kuch aisi adaa pai, takata teri surat harek tamaashai
 After finishing Ghazal, she finally says with a teenage stare, 'mera Naam Akhtari Bai Faizabad' Bibi very soon started singing Ghazal, Thumri, Tappa, Dadra and Khyal with equal rights
 aage chalakar hindustan ne unhen 'mallika-e-ghazal' kaha or padmabhushan se nawaja
 In India, sehra Akhtari Bai should be tied to elevate Ghazal singing based on classical ragas
 'divaana bananaa he to divaana bana de
 
 ', 'koyaliya mat kar pukaar kareja lage kataar
 
 ', 'chaa rahi gata jiya mora laharaaya he' jaise geet unke prasiddh geeton main shumaar hai
 While his singing was full of finesse and sadness on the one hand, on the other hand it also had classicalism and heart touching depths
 aawaaj main gajab kaa loch, ranjaktaa or bhav abhivyakti ke canvas ko anant rangon se rangane kii kshamta ke kaaran unki gaain thumariyaan bejod hai
 When Gaalib was sang by Begum, 'ye na thi hamari kismat, which visal-e-yaar Hota' Akhtari had everything, but she considered the woman's greatest success to be a successful wife
 isi chahat ne unki mulaakaat lakhanu main barrister ishtiya ahamed abbasi se karai
 The meeting soon turned into nikah and with it became Akhtari Bai, Begum Akhtar, but after this due to social restrictions, Begum Sahiba had to leave the song
 duniya kii inaayaat ne unka dil tod diya
 Some of the world's Inayat broke the heart, respected by the well-known people of Begum Sahiba
 sarojini naidu or shastreey gayak pandit jasraj unke jabardast prashansak the, to caphi azmi bhi apni gajalon ko begum sahiba kii aawaaj main sunakar mantrmugdh ho jate the
 In 1974, Begum Akhtar sang this Ghazal of Kaifi Azmi on the occasion of her birthday
 'suna karo meri jaan, inase unase afsane, sab ajanabeen hai yahaan, koun kahaan kise pahachaane'gayaki chhodana unke liye vaisaa hi tha, jaise ek machhlee kaa pani ke bina rahanaa
 She could not sing for about five years and began to be ill
 yahi vah vakt tha jab sangeet ke kshetra main unki vaapasi unki girti sehat ke liye hitkar sabit hui or 1949 main vah recording studio lautin
 He sang three Ghazals and one Dadra at the Lucknow radio station
 iske baad unki ankhon se aansu chhalak pade or unhone sangeet goshtiyon kaa rukh kar liya
 This series started again, then never stopped again
 mere hamanafas, mere hamanawaan, mujhe dost banakar dagaa na de
 Listen, the voice of Pandit Jasraj and Begum Akhtar
 khamaaj or kaaphi raag, hori thumari
 Kaise yeh dhoom machai re, Kanhaiya On October 30, 1974, Begum Sahiba's body said goodbye to the world, but her voice was an agreement to comfort the generations to come, which even today, with the iphone in hand, the boy 'begum Akhtar on youtube Gazals' keep writing
 kala kshetra main yogadan ke liye bharat sarkaar ne begum akhtar ko 1972 main sangeet naatak academy puraskaar, 1968 main padmashri or 1975 main padmabhushan se sammanit kiya
 Listen to the voice of Begum Akhtar, the one who was in agreement among you upie, congress or rashtriya salaahkaar parishad kii adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne pichley kareeb saat saalon main 49 baar vayusena ke vimaanon or helicopteron kaa upyog kiya, jinamein se sabase zyada 23 baar vah pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii sah-yatri thim
 According to information received under the Right to Information (RTI), between 2006-07 to September 2012, he traveled with 49 Air Force aircraft and helicopters, while Rahul Gandhi eight times from 2008-09 to September 2012
 And used helicopters
 sonia gandhi yaa rahul gandhi apane naam se vayusena kaa vimaan yaa helicopter arakshit kar yatra karne kii paatrata nahin rakhte hai
 For this, they have to travel with such eligibility person
 vayusena ke mutabik, niyamon ke tahat vayusena ke vimaanon kaa upyog karne ke paatr vyakti apni yatra ke uddeshyon ke liye kisi vyakti ko apane saath le ja sakate he
 Other ministers of the central government can also use the Air Force aircraft with the approval of the Prime Minister and can take a person with them as per the need for government functions
 pradhanmantri ke baad sonia gandhi ke saath sabase zyada yatra karne kaa saubhaahgya rakshaamantri eke antni or purv videsh evam vittamantri pranab mukherjee (ab raashtrapati) ko mila
 With these two, Sonia Gandhi traveled six times by air force aircraft and helicopters
 rakshaamantri eke antni kii sansad main 7 may, 2012 ko di gai jaankaree ke anusaar niyamon ke tahat, pradhanmantri, uppradhanmantri, rakshaamantri or grahamantri sarkari kaamkaaj ke liye vayusena ke vimaanon kaa upyog karne ke paatr hai, jabaki gaiyr-sarkari kaaryon ke liye keval pradhanmantri vayusena ke vimaanon kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 Hisar-based RTI activist Ramesh Verma had sought information from the Ministry of Defense and Air Force Headquarters about Air Force vips and helicopters for travel and expenses of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
 mili jaankaree ke anusaar, 30 sitambar 2012 tak sonia gandhi kii yatra ke kiraaye ke mad main karnataka sarkaar par ek karod 17 lakh 15 hajaar 83 rupee or rahul gandhi kii yatra ke mad main assam sarkaar par aath lakh 26 hajaar 457 rupee baaki hai
 Since both the Congress leaders had reserved the aircraft in their name and the yatra was done, hence the liability of these two governments also
 sonia gandhi ne 49 baar vayusena ke vimaan kii sevaayen leen, jisamen 42 baar unhone in sevaaon kaa upyog pradhanmantri yaa kisi aise paatr vyakti ke naam par kiya, jinhen iske badale koi bhugtan nahin karnaa padataa he
 He traveled seven times with the approval of the Prime Minister along with such ministers etc

 haalanki, ye baat alag he ki wo khud pradesh kii jagah rashtriya raajnneeti main haath aajamaayenge
 Manvendra Singh, son of senior BJP leader and former Union Minister Jaswant Singh, is currently an MLA from the Shiv Assembly seat
 rajput samaaj se aane vaale maanavendra ke congress main shaamil hone se pashchimi rajasthan kii raajnneeti main bada badlaav hone kii ummid he
 Rajputs have traditionally been BJP voters in this area, in which case Rajput voters can join Congress in large numbers
 patnichitra sinhalad sakati hai chunaavabarmer main maanavendra singh ke parivaar kaa prabhutv rahaa he
 He himself has been elected MP from barmer-jaisalmer Lok Sabha constituency
 1999 main maanavendra ne pehali baar loksabhaa chunaav isi seat se ladaa tha, haalanki wo jeet nahin paae the
 After this, Manvendra Singh won the election from barmer-jaisalmer Lok Sabha seat in 2004 despite the slogan of Shining India
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main maanavendra singh ne barmer kii shiv seat se bijepi ke tikat par kismat aajamaai or wo jeet gaye
 But in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when his father Jaswant Singh did not get a ticket from BJP, his distance from BJP increased
 ab jabaki maanavendra singh congress main janaa tay mana ja rahaa he, aise main charchaa ye he ki patni chitra singh unki seat se chunaav ladengi
 'swabhiman Rally' Manvendra Singh convened on September 22 in Pachpadra, Chitra Singhbadmer, became active and made everything clear by stating BJP was a big mistake
 lekin is raily se pehle hi maanavendra kii patni chitra singh saarvajanik taur par active najar aane lagi thim
 Before the Swabhiman rally, during the youth outrage rally in Barmer, Chitra Singh had said from behind the veil that overthrow a government that does not protect self-respect
 unhone vasundhara raaje kii rajasthan gaurav yatra par tanj kiya tha
 Apart from this, Chitra Singh is openly expressing her views on many fronts
 maanavendra ke pita rahe kendriya mantrimanvendra singh ke pita jaswant singh bijepi ke sansthaapak sadasyon main rahe hai
 Jaswant Singh is counted among the most pro-mp leaders
 wo chaar baar loksabhaa saansad rahe hai, jabaki paanch baar rajyasabha saansad ke bataur unhone sevaayen di hai
 But the party did not give him a ticket in the 2014 elections, behind which Vasundhara Raje was considered as the reason
 haalanki, jaswant singh or siem vasundhara raaje ke bich pehle kaaphi achche sambandh the, lekin pichley saat-aath saal main donon ke bich duuri paidaa ho gai
 As a result, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP fielded Colonel Sonaram Choudhary instead of giving ticket to Jaswant Singh from Barmer
 bijepi se tikat na milane ke baad jaswant singh nirdaleey taur par chunaav lade the
 Despite the Modi wave, Jaswant Singh managed to get more than 4 lakh votes, although he did not win
 maanavendra ne is chunaav main apane pita ke khilaaf or bijepi pratyaashee sonaaram choudhary ke paksh main prachaar karne se manaa kar diya tha
 The result of which he had to face as a side line from the party
 ab yah charchaa he ki maanavendra singh vidhansabha chunaav nahin ladenge balki barmer se agle saal loksabhaa chunaav lard sakate hai
 So far, claims of allocation of five seats are being made to Manvendra Singh's group
 inamen unki patni chitra ke shiv seat se ladane kii ummid he
 While Manvendra Singh will carry forward the father's legacy of national politics
 supreme court ne haal main sampann hue loksabhaa chunaav ko radd karne kii janhit yachika ko khaarij kar diya he
 This petition was filed by lawyer Manohar Lal Sharma, who questioned the credibility of evms and demanded the cancellation of the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections
 supreme court main sunwaayee ke dauraan justise rohinton nariman ne vakil emel sharma se kaha ki aap kya chaahate hai sharma ji? ham puure loksabhaa chunaav ko radd kar den? supreme court ne sakht tippanee karte hue yachika par sunwaayee se inkaar kar diya
 Questioning the credibility of evms in the petition of advocate ML Sharma, it has been said that the Election Commission does not have the right to conduct elections through evms
 sharma kii daleel he ki janpratinidhitiv adhimium ke mutabik bhi ayog sirf ballat paper ke jariye hi chunaav kara saktaa he
 Senior advocate ML Sharma has demanded the Supreme Court to ban the election from evms
 unhone kaha he ki iviem kii vishwasaneeyata ko lekar hameshaa se sawaal khadey hote rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is necessary to return to the election process from ballot paper

 Parties such as Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, often voting in favor of the government, also took a strong stand against the government's decision

 The all-party meeting called on 29 November to resolve this bottleneck also ended in a deadlock

 Its failure to mobilize support from within the coalition and the opposition highlighted the government's failure to reach key sectors that are likely to be affected by FDI in retail

 a 2008 study by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), an independent Delhi-based think-tank, underlined that organized retail trade would benefit farmers significantly

 Farmers selling to organized retailers were also found to be more likely to get loans from the bank
 kisaanon ke thode samooh kuch samay se khudara kshetra main epadi kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 In August, Ajay Jakhar, president of Bharat Krishak Samaj, a non-political farmer organization with a nationwide membership, wrote to the Prime Minister, arguing in favor of allowing FDI in retail, "middlemen, commission agents and retail markets in vegetable markets The monopoly of private circles of street vendors and vegetable sellers runs

" unka kahana he, ''jo partiyaan sarkaar ke faisle kaa virodh kar rahi hai, ve sirf kiraanaa store maalikon ke liye apni chintaa jataa rahi hai
 There does not seem to be any concern about how much the farmers will benefit if their produce is purchased directly through large retailers

 But he did not do so

 Says Rajiv Kumar, "grocery store owners are very hopeful that they will defeat the big retailers in the competition
" do-tihaai log kehete hai ki ve apane bacchon ko bhi isi dhandhe main dekhnaa chaahate hai
 The experience of organized retailers in India supports Kumar's theory

 sabharwal maanate hai ki khudara kshetra main epadi ko anumati dene se bharat ke rojgaron main ek gunatmak antar aa saktaa he
 "93 percent of India's workforce is in the unorganized sector," he says

 co / 2f3ty294aa tibeti dharmaguru dalai lamas ne apane uttaradhikari ke chayan ko lekar china ko naseehat di he
 He said that China cannot decide my successor as it does not come under his jurisdiction
 dalai lamas ne kaha ki mere uttaradhikari kaa faisla tibet kii janata karegi
 Please tell that there has been a conflict between India and China on this matter
 haal hi main china ne kaha tha ki dalai lamas ke uttaradhikari kaa faisla china main hona chahie or is masale par bharat kaa dakhal sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 China does not want to involve any spiritual process in appointing the next Dalai Lama, on the other hand, the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, is traditionally chosen to include the spiritual process
 vartmaan dalai lamas (84) ke anusaar, unke uttaradhikari ko chunane kii prakriya varsh 2025 main tab shuru hogi jab vah 90 varsh ke ho jaaenge
 The Dalai Lama said in a statement that no recognition should be given to a politically elected candidate, including the people of the Republic of China
 dalai lamas ne haalanki apane uttaradhikari ko chunane ke liye yojit hone vaali tamaam prakriyaaon ko spasht nahin kiya he, lekin vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki buddha mathon main prarthanaaon or tantric anushthanon ke saath unke deh dhaaran (punarjanm) kii maang kii jaati he
 The 15th Dalai Lama to be elected this time will be in contrast to his 14 predecessor Dalai Lamas, as they will be selected at a time when their predecessors (who held that position before them) will still be alive

 If you have read the news of business, then it will be noted that many years ago, the Modi government announced a package of 6000 crores for the textile sector
 aaj tak bharat kaa textile sector ubar nahin sakaa he
 Textile has been one of the sectors providing employment
 june 2016 main modi cabinet ne package kii ghoshnaa karte vakt kaha tha ki agle teen saal main yani 2019 tak textile sector main 1 karod rojgaar paidaa kiye jaaenge or 75,000 karod kaa nivesh hoga

 Of course the Modi government is a politically successful government
 iske aage berojgaare jaise mudde bhi bogus sabit ho jate hai
 a bogus move like demonetisation also goes right under the cover of the political success of the Modi government
 yahi kaaran he ki chunaav main haarane ke baad vipaksh apane rojgaar kii talash main bijepi main ja rahaa he
 Opposition knows that if politics is to be saved, then move to BJP because people are going to vote for BJP only by losing jobs, pension and savings
