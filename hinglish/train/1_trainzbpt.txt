 Some of the issues brought up in these meetings may be mentioned in the possible manifesto after the conference
 input: bhashaa If anyone in India is still interested in the results, the Congress can finally decide on the coming Saturday who will be its next president who will replace Rahul Gandhi
 rahul gandhi lagbhag teen maheene pehle pad chhod chuke hai
 The Congress Working Committee or CWC, which takes all decisions on behalf of the party, will meet on Saturday
 isamen is baat par vichaar ho saktaa he ki koun party pramukh ke liye yogya ho saktaa he
 It consists largely of leaders who contested elections 30 years ago
 seedblusi sutron ke anusaar, agle netaa ke chunaav ke liye netaaon ke ek samooh kaa gathan kiya jayega
 In this, a candidate's name can be agreed
 markat vaale aantarik chunaavon se bachane ke liye aam taur par ek majboot raajnneetik dal ke liye yahi ek adarsh tarika hoga
 But when we are talking about the Congress, a small group of senior leaders have told the former party president Sonia Gandhi that this election could lead to a split of the party
 party ke koshadhyaksh ahamed patel varisht netaa 59 varshiya mukul vaasanic ke liye kaam kar rahe hai, jinhone aakhri baar 2009 main maharashtra ke ramtek se chunaav jeeta tha
 Wasnik's main plus point is that he is a Scheduled Caste leader who is not only qualified but also keen on playing the role of retaining his hold on the party after the Gandhi family
 vaasanic party main un yathasthitivaadiyon ke ummidavaar hai, jo ki parivartan se darate hai
 They feel that change should not ruin their own political career
 ve adarsh rup main gandhi parivaar ke sadsy kii tarah hai jo ki mahal ke darbar main hi falte-phoolate bane rahanaa chaahate hai
 Many leaders who have supported Rahul Gandhi say that they want such a change in the party that can revive the party
 ek mahatvakankshi yuva netaa jo ki adhyaksh ke rup main chunaa janaa chahega, ne mujhase kaha, "agar ve phir se dharre par chalate hue vaasanic ko niyukt karte hai, to party vibhajit ho jaaegi
 Why are they afraid of elected leaders? Why do they want a temporary system? ”it is also a fact that Jyotiraditya Scindia, the young general secretary of the party with deep penetration among the Gandhi family, unexpectedly broke the rank and publicly announced the government’s decision to abolish special status of Kashmir
 welcomed
 yah party kii line se hatakar tha
 Some party leaders believe that those who welcomed the Modi government's move, including Milind Deora, Dipendra Hooda, Janardan Dwivedi and Abhishek Manu Singhvi, are applying for jobs in the BJP
 maine kuch yuva netaaon se is bare main baat kii
 One of them asked "I am contesting elections, i am 40 years old, should i write my future, because the party cannot make up its mind?" He pointed to the fact that the party made no preparations for a united response in the matter of taking away Kashmir's special state status, while in fact the entire country run by whatsapp knew what the Modi government had planned
 jaahir he, jab sarkaar ne amarnath yatra ko radd kar diya, paryatakon ko kashmir ghati chhodane ke liye kaha or vahaan atirikt sainikon ko tainaat kar diya, tab kuch yuva netaaon ne is par pratikriya ke liye nirnay lene ke liye congress kii tatkaal baithak karne kii maang kii
 But senior leaders insisted that the party should decide its side only after the government takes action
 modi sarkaar ke agenda or kathavstu ke sthapit ho jane ke baad uske jawaab main is tarah kaa hangaamaa congress kii pahchaan ban gaya he
 It shows the party as weak and highlights the lack of principles, ideology or leadership in it
 is baar haryana, maharashtra or jharkhand rajyon ke ve netaa jo agle do maheenon main apni nai sarkaron ke liye vot karenge, ne artical 370 par bhram kii sthiti main vidroh kiya
 They are telling senior leaders that the party is going against the mood of the public
 rahul or sonia gandhi ne tab hastkshep kiya or kaha ki sankalp party kii us prakriya par nakhushi ko darshayega jiske tahat bhaajapa ne anuchhed 370 dwaara kashmir ko di gai vishesh sthiti ko hataa diya
 a leader who welcomed the repeal of Article 370 says, "for me, this is a risk
" gulam nabi azaad jinhone over-da-top pad liya or unka party main srinagar yaa dilli main koi karier nahin bachaa he
 "some similar assessments in Congress are of the majority of leaders
 yadi shanivaar ko party vaasanic ko yaa ek samooh ko prabhaar saunpti he, to bahut saare netaa yah kehete te hue ki congress main khud ko sudhaarney kii koi kshamta nahin he, saamaanya rup se baahar nikal sakate hai
 If the party follows Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh's advocacy of making a young grassroots leader the party president, it could prevent many from going out
 lekin dilachasp baat yah he ki yuva takat ke vikalp ke bare main baat hi nahin kii ja rahi he
 Most of the country has stopped taking interest in the Congress which has become an endless soap apera
 shanivaar aane den, ham janenge ki kya congress bhi apane hit main kaam kar sakati he

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki jab yahaan par baadh ai to congress ke vidhayak bangaleru main mouj kar rahe the, lekin bijepi ke netaa or mukhyamantri logon kii madad kar rahe the
 Will you forgive those who did not live with you in misery? congress ke logon ko sirf satta se matlab he, jab yahaan baadh main log dub rahe the to congress ke vidhayak bangaleru main congress vidhayak swimming pool main dubkiyaan laga rahe the
 The PM once again attacked former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi here

 He did not abuse me
 He said that we have lived such a life that the security of the border is necessary here and there and Pakistan
 manishankar ayyar par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki unhone mujhe gaali ko di yaa tumne gaali di yaa gujarat ko di
 If i do not talk about abuses, then the people of Gujarat will give an account on the 14th
 jab hamaari sena ne sargical strike kii thi, to log khush ho rahe the
 But the Congress was having problems, it was asking us the question whether what happened or not
 jab doklam hua to inhone hamase baat nahin kii, china se baat nahin kii
 Did i go to Pakistan to give my betel nut? PM said that when i became PM, Iyer went to Pakistan and was discussing there, now Modi has come, if it is not removed then india-pakistan relations will not improve
 pakistan main jaakar ye modi ko raste se hataane kii baat kar rahe the
 Did you go to give a betel nut to Modi in Pakistan, i have nothing to do with people from Gujarat
 Mr
 Mani Shankar Aiyar told people when he visited Pakistan - remove Modi from the way and then see what will happen to india-pakistan peace
 What did he mean by removing me from the way
 And what is my crime- that we have the blessings of the people: PM @ narendramodi — narendramodi_in (@narendramodi_in) December 8, 2017 Punish Congress i know the difference unhone kaha ki pehle gujarat main aae-din karfu laga rahata tha, lekin ab aisa nahin he

 manmohan-sonia par varaunhone kaha ki jab manmohan singh pradhanmantri the or sonia gandhi sarkaar chalaa rahi thim to maine uria ko lekar patr likhe the lekin koi jawaab nahin miltaa tha
 When i became PM, many state cms used to write letters to me
 to maine adhikariyon ko bulaayaa, unhone mujhase poocha ki aapako kaise khabar milti he
 i told the officials that i have come to work on the ground, not from above
 hamaari sarkaar ne neem coating kaa kaam shuru kiya, jisase sabhi shikaayatein dur ho gai
 The PM said that the laddu of Gandhinagar and the laddu of New Delhi are also in your hand, both are ladoos

 america raashtrapati donald trump or uttar korea ke supreme leader kim jong un ke bich hone vaali aitihaasik mulaakaat tal sakati he
 Even before the meeting in Singapore on June 12, there are some such signs, which are making it less likely to happen
 agar baithak hoti bhi he to apane tay samay par nahin hogi
 In such a situation, the question is that the way Donald Trump has created an atmosphere about this meeting, now he will back down from his promise
 kyon jataai ja rahi ashanka?darasal, jab se donon netaaon kii baithak kii baat saamne ai he
 Since then the US has continuously pressured North Korea to stop its nuclear programs, with North Korea also promising that it would soon cancel nuclear testing programs

 jiske baad uttar korea ne sabhi ko chaunkaate hue dakshin korea ke saath ucch-stareey baithak radd kar di thi
 The coin issued has been tremendous in view of the meeting of both the leaders
 haal hi main america kii military ne ek special sikaa jari kiya tha, jisamen trump or kim jong un kaa cheharaa dikhaaya gaya tha
 In this, the term Supreme Leader was used for Kim Jong Un

 Swine flu is spreading in many parts of the country
 isse bachane ke liye saavdhaanee baratane kii jarurat to he lekin un afvaahon se bhi bachanaa chahie jo iske bare main alag-alag sroton se fail rahi hai
 Let's know about 5 rumors related to swine flu
 1
 It cannot be treated
 It is a rumor
 swine flu kaa aasaani se ilaaj sambhav he
 The name of Temiflu comes from the swine flu medicine, which controls it rapidly
 lakshan dikhaai dene ke 48 ghante ke andar ilaaj shuru ho janaa chahie
 This medicine reduces rapid infection
 swine flu hone ke pehle 48 ghanton ke bheetar ilaaj shuru ho janaa chahie
 There is a five-day treatment, in which Temiflu is given to the patient
 2
 There is no shortage of medicines in India
 ek report ke mutabik bharat ke paas abhi 60 hajaar se zyada dose hai
 In addition, there are one thousand syrup doses for children
 hetero, natco or strids acrolab jaisi pharma companiyaan bahut kam samay main or dose taiyaar kar sakati he
 3
 jindagi main sirf ek baar hota he swine fluyah ek bhram he
 It is definitely that once you recover from the grip of H1N1 virus, your body tries to create a strong resistance against that particular virus within itself
 lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki aapako dobaaraa is virus kaa sankraman nahin hoga
 If you are often coming in contact with infected people then you can fall prey again
 haalanki vaxineshan kaa vikalp bhi he jo ek saal tak aapako is virus se bachaae rakhata he
 4
 pork khaane se hota he swine fluswine flu kaa janm bhale hi suaron se hua ho, lekin iske failane kaa pork khaane yaa na khaane se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 The H1N1 virus spreads most through the air
 jab aap khansate yaa cheenkte hai to hawa main yaa jameen par yaa kisi bhi sataha par munh or naak se nikle drav kan girte hai, vah virus kii chapet main aa jaataa he
 These particles enter the body of another person through air or by touching someone through mouth or nose
 yani swine flu kaa virus haath milaane or gale lagane ke alaava kisi daravaaje, phone, keyboard, remote control ke jariye bhi fail saktaa he
 5
 swine flu ke virus kaa ho gaya he mutesanabharat kii do pramukh lab- neshnal institute of vyrology pune or neshnal centre of disease control dilli ke hafte bhar puraane shodh ke mutabik virus kaa muteshan nahin hua he
 The process of any permanent change in the DNA of a gene is called mutation in biology
 jaruri nahin he ki har sankramit vyakti ke sampark main aane par aapako anivaary rup se yah virus apni chapet main le le
 People with low immunity are at greater risk of getting H1N1
 swine flu ke ahm lakshanon main 101 degree se zyada kaa bukhaar teen din se zyada samay tak rahata he
 Shortness of breath, phlegm, chest pain, lethargy, fatigue, vomiting and loss of appetite are also important symptoms
 mukhyamantri ne kaha, ''vipaksh lagaataar nakaaratmak raajnneeti ko badhaava de rahaa he
 For this reason, Pakistan also goes to international forums on this issue
 " unhone aarope lagaaya ki yojanaon kaa tushtikaran karnaa or bharat ke andar aatankwaad or naksalwad ko badhaava dena vipaksh kaa kaam he
 Yogi said, "the then Congress leadership denigrated Hindus by calling them terrorists
 '' unhone kaha ki uttar pradesh yuvaaon kaa pradesh he kyonki yahaan sabase adhik yuva rahete hai
 There will be many people who will get the opportunity to join this mahaparva for the first time in democracy
 unhone yuvaaon se kaha, "aapkaa ek vot desh ko banane main badi bhoomika nibhaayega
 If your vote goes in the negative direction then it will only bring negativity
 hamaare jivan main nakaaratmak chizon kii jarurat nahin honi chahie
 The Chief Minister said that whenever negative elements have conspired against the country, then the youth has worked to eliminate it
 raashtra ke nirmaan or samaaj ke nirmaan ke liye apane is adhikaar kaa prayogjrur karen
 Taking a dig at the SP-BSP, Yogi said, "SP and BSP in the state used to act like 'abdullah Deewana in Begani Shaadi'
 inhen congress ne kabhi saath aane ke liye nahin kaha, lekin ye donon sibiai or idi ke dar se samarthan detii raheen
 " congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha ki aazaadee ke baad 70 varshon tak ek parivaar ne desh par raaj kiya
 Had that beginning been good, India would have been established as a superpower today
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa kii kathani or kerani main koi fark nahin he or yah narendra modi kii sarkaar ke 55 maheene ke kaarykaal main saaf dikhaa he jabaki congress kii kathani-kerani kaa antar pichley 55 saalon main janata ne dekha or jhela he

 bhale hi samaajawaadee party main sabakuch thik ho gaya ho
 Akhilesh Yadav's name has been stamped by the Election Commission on SP
 lekin, ravivaar dopaher sapa ke ghoshnaa patr jari karne ke maukey par kuch aisa hua jo aaj tak kabhi nahin hua tha
 This is the first time that the sp's manifesto has been issued in the absence of Mulayam Singh Yadav
 manch par sabase bich main mulaayam singh kii kursi lagi thi lekin, vah khaali hi rah gai
 To convince Mulayam, Akhilesh called, Azam himself went to his house but the leader did not come
 baad main akhilesh ne unki namaujuudagi main hi ghoshnaa patr jari kiya
 Apart from Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, his wife and party MP Dimple Yadav, senior leader Kiranmoy Nanda and other senior leaders were present during the release of the manifesto
 baad main akhilesh-dimple pahunche mulaayam ke pasghoshnaa patr jari karne jab mulaayam nahin pahunche to kaarykram ke baad unhen manaane unke bete akhilesh yadav or unki bahu dimple yadav khud unke paas gaye or unhen party kaa ghoshnaa patr dikhaaya
 SP leader Azam Khan was already there

 com / e9psidt20x — Akhilesh Yadav (@yadavakhilesh) January 22, 2017 Mulayam Can 'mann Ki Baat' Both Mulayam and Shivpal kept a distance from the program of releasing the declaration letter on Sunday
 ummid jataai ja rahi he ki somvaar ko mulaayam singh yadav press conferes kar apane man kii baat sabake saamne rakh sakate hai
 According to sources, some close to Mulayam is pressurizing him to campaign for RLD
 aapako bataa den ki areldi in chunaavon main rajya ke sabhi siton par chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar chuki he or sitapur jile kii kaman usnemulaayam or shivpal ke khasarhe rampal yadav ko saunpi he
 Mulayam's displeasure is not because of this, according to sources, Mulayam Singh has believed that there should be differences in politics, not discrimination
 lekin, akhilesh or shivpal ke bich kii duuri unhen pareshaan kar rahi he
 When the party released the manifesto, Shivpal Yadav's face was missing from the party poster on the stage
 party ne poster par sirf akhilesh yadav or mulaayam singh ke chehre ko hi tarjeeh di he
 In such a situation, it is believed that the Samajwadi Party will go ahead without Shivpal Yadav
 ghoshnaa patr ke kaarykram se chachaa shivpal bhi nadaarad hi rahe
 Apart from this, Mulayam Singh is angry with his favorite candidates not being elected and his special leader Ambika Chaudhary who recently joined the BSP quitting SP
 jabaki johar uniwarsity ke faikalti dow gulrez nizami ne ilzaam lagaaya ki "aaj police uniwarsity administration ko bataae bina uniwarsity main ghus gai or librari ko andar se band kar liya
 During this time no one was allowed to go to university

 Police found around 200 rare books in the library
 police ko jaankaree mili thi ki chori huin saikadon saal puraani durlabh kitaaben mohammad ali johar uniwarsity kii central librari main hone kii ashanka he
 Superintendent of Police Ajay Pal Sharma said that many books stolen from Madrasa Alia have been recovered here
 unhone bataaya ki johar uniwarsity kii librari main rakhe gaye register or record main kahin bhi in pustakon kaa ullekh nahin mil rahaa he
 Minister of State for Defense MM Pallam Raju said that there is no need to be worried about the news of Pakistan digging a tunnel in the border areas
 raju ne patrakaron se kaha ‘‘har desh ko apni raksha karne kaa adhikaar he
 As we adopt methods, Pakistan is also preparing itself
 hamen is par chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin he
 It was reported in the media that Pakistan is digging tunnels near its Indian border in Sargodha in Punjab province
 report main kaha gaya tha ki yah surangen kisi sadak kii ore nahin ja raheen, jisase andeh he ki ye parmaanu hathiyaar yaa missile surakshit rakhane ke liye taiyaar ho rahi hai
 About the danger of Pakistan's nuclear weapons falling into the wrong arms, he said, "we hope that the Government of Pakistan is taking adequate steps to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands
" ’’ raju ne kaha ‘‘koi bhi ghatana agar ho rahi he, to pakistan yah nahin samaj rahaa he ki unhone jo bhi boyaa, vah use hi kaat rahe hai
 It is hurting Pakistan as much as us
 ’’ Those sages of the pre-vedic period must have been stunning, who created a rich language like Sanskrit
 apni bahut sari visgantiyon ke baavjood vaidic sahitya kaa ek hissaa vishwa kii gyaan or darshan kii parampara kaa anmol hissaa he
 It is also astonishing to think that the eloquent grammarian such as Panini had created 'ashtadhyayi' like 4000 sutras 2500 years ago and laid down the rules of grammar
 unke baad sanskrit ne kalidas jaise mahakavi paidaa kiye or shudrak jaise adbhut naatakkaar
 Texts like Ramayana and Mahabharata were written in this language which are unique texts of its kind in the world
 lekin aisa kya hua ki aisi adbhut adwitiya bhashaa kalkram main lagbhag vilop ke kagaar par pahunch gai? ve koun log the jinhone sanskrit ko dharm or shuchita kii aisi bediyon main baandha ki uski sari jeevantta ghutakar rah gai? ve koun log the jinhone shanbuk ko veda padhane par dandit karne kii maang kii thi or jinke prabhutv ke aage maryaada purushottam kahalaane vaale ram ko bhi jhukna padaa tha?darasal shanbuk vadh se sanskrit ke vadh kii katha bhi shuru hoti he
 Those who decided that on the basis of Sanskrit religion and varna would be the prerogative of only a few people, they wrote the memoir of Sanskrit only
 sanskrit se vanchit logon ne apane liye alag bhashaaen ijad kar leen- akhir kisi bhi samaaj kaa kaam bhashaa ke bina nahin chalata
 According to the legend, Shambook was killed so that the dead son of a Brahmin could live
 shanbuk mara nahin, brahman ke bete sanskrit ko maar-maar kar jite rahe
 Gradually she became the language of hypocrisy of the pandits reciting the Abuja mantra in impure language
 buddha or mahavir jab hue to unhone is bhashaa ko apane liye aparyaapt mana
 He resorted to Pali to reach the folk
 bhashaaen aage badhati raheen- paali, praakrit, apbhransh, avadhi, braj ek badi parampara banaate rahe
 Ramkatha is no longer in love with Valmiki Ramayana, she reached the people with the help of Tulsi's Ramcharit Manas
 chahen to yaad kar sakate hai ki banaras main hi aaj ke updraviyon ke vaicharik purakhon ne tulsidas ko janabhasha main ramcharitamanas likhane se rokane kii koshish kii thi
 Amritlal Nagar's novel 'manas ke swan' explains in detail how Tulsidas tried to burn the manuscript and Tulsidas was forced to move from Banaras to Ayodhya
 isi tarah krishna kii katha ko surdaas or raskhan ne bachaaya
 What happened to Sanskrit texts during this time? They descended from people's memories and stayed in some of the cellars
 huentsang or magasthanij ke yatra vrittanton main unka zikr bachaa rahaa
 Later his translations were done by Persian scholars like Dara Shikoh
 aadhunik samay main maxmooler jaise europea vidwaan na hue hote to bhashaa kii yah behad samrudh parampara na jane kahaan bila gai hoti
 Therefore, the Sanskrit tradition should be thankful to the British for saving this wealth of knowledge
 aaj kaa sach yahi he ki sanskrit vishvavidhyalayon ke sanskrit vibhaagon or abhilekhagaaron main padi hui bhashaa he
 In some tolls it may be spoken like a stubbornness, but it is not the language of any state
 yahaan tak ki sanskrit sahitya ko uddhrut karne vaale adhiktar vidwaan mul sanskrit paath kii jagah unke angrezi anuwaadon kii madad lete dekhe jate hai
 a Lunjpanj culture has developed in the name of Sanskrit reading and reading
 sanskrit or firoz khan main arya-anarya kaa fark dekhne vaale jaahilon ko yah bhi nahin maaloom ki bhashashastra kii drushti se sanskrit or farsi ek hi parivaar kii bhashaaen hai
 The sources and formulas of this linguistic family called indo-european meet in such a way that it is surprising
 angrezi, farsi or sanskrit main milane vaale 'brother', 'birdar' or 'bhratri' jaise shabd hon yaa phir 'doter', 'dukhtar' or 'duhita' jaisi sangati, yaa phir 'centuri', 'sadi' yaa 'shatabdi' jaisi kalganana- yah rishta bahut bada he or bahut dur tak failaa he
 Actually it is just a matter of understanding, be it languages or cultures - they are broadly similar among themselves, they get long life
 raktashuddhta kaa aagrah unke liye jaanaleva sabit hota he
 As such, bloodshed is a kind of myth in civilization
 beshak, bhashaaon ko unki satta kaa bal bhi miltaa he, lekin ve bachi rahati hai or failati rahati hai to isliye ki ve ek-duusare se ghul-mil kar nae praan or arth arjeet karti chalati hai
 Often those who say Sanskrit as the mother of Indian languages forget that Sanskrit may not be a mother or a maternal grandmother
 bich kii bahut sari kadiyaan hai jinamein bahut sari nadiyon kaa pani mila he
 Amir Khusro was the first to create the Hindi we speak today as a standing dialect
 is hindi par arabi or farsi kii chaaya itani badi he ki aksar isamen sanskrit kaa samavesh kritrim jaan padataa he
 English has developed with the words of languages around the world - there is no need to be very scholar to know this
 sanskrit ke maujuuda maahaul main firoz khan jaisaa koi shikshak aata he to vah ghutan bhare band kamare kii ek khidki kholta he
 But these fresh winds are still not acceptable to those who have developed the practice of living in a darkness and want the whole society to move towards this darkness
 beshak, inaki sankhya zyaada nahin he, lekin inhen lagata he ki inhen aaj kii satta kii us vaichariki kaa bal hasil he jo ateet ke gauravgaan kii nakli parampara ko sampurna bhartiya parampara ke paryaay ke rup main sthapit karnaa chaahati he
 But if Feroz Khan teaches Sanskrit tradition at Banaras Hindu University, that tradition will be rich
 ramakatha kaa adhyayan karne vaale kamil bulke ne ramakatha ko nae kshitij hi die
 Their Christianity did not come in the way
 sanskrit or dharm kii shreshthata kaa ahankaar paalane vaale logon ko antat itihaas dhul main mila detaa he- yah sanskrit kaa hi haal bataata he
 But the politics of Shambuk slaughter continues today - without realizing that Shambook will be born again, Sanskrit will be left behind

 yachikakarta ne hai court main daawa kiya tha ki anuchhed 370 ek asthai praavdhaan tha jo 1957 main samvidhan sabha bhang hone ke saath hi khatm ho gaya
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday revealed that India has asked influential countries of the G8 and G5 to pressurize Pakistan to take action against terrorism and opt for friendship with India
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki unhen ummid he ki agle hafte misr main pakistani pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani ke saath mulaakaat main pakistan mumbai ‘‘narsanhaar’’ ke shadyantrkariyon ko nyaay ke kathghare main laane par sahamat hoga or apni dharti se bharat ke khilaaf aatankwaad ko ijaajat nahin degaa

 There is an appeal to all our leaders and we have asked them to pressurize Pakistan to leave the path of terrorism and adopt a path of friendship with India and to carry forward relations with India
 ’’ pradhanmantri ne yah baat ek sawaal ke jawaab main kahi
 He was asked if there was anything "positive" from Pakistan on India's demands after his meeting with Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari in Yekaterinburg, Russia last month, and whether India was responsible for terrorism operating there from Islamabad Demand for international pressure to be created against
 'lambit muddon ke samaadhaan ke liye har jaruri cheez karenge'pakistan kii taraf se bharat kii maang par mumbai hamalon ke shadyantrkariyon ke khilaaf karrwai se nayi dilli ko avgat karaae jane kii baat kahi gai

 Political controversy has arisen over the meeting of Ved Pratap Vedic, a close aide of the most wanted terrorists Hafiz Saeed and Baba Ramdev
 vipakshi dalon ne is masale par sansad main aaj jamkar hangaamaa kiya or centre kii modi sarkaar ko gherne kii koshish kii
 The proceedings of the House have been disrupted due to the uproar of the opposition
 rajyasabha kii kaarywahi shuru hui to congress ke saansadon ne said-vaidic mulaakaat ke mudde par jamkar hangaamaa kiya
 Digvijay Singh of Congress raised this issue in the House
 iske baad satyavrath chaturvedi or anand sharma bhi apni seat par khadey ho gaye or centre sarkaar se is masale par jawaab maanga
 Congress leaders did not allow the Question Hour to run
 anand sharma ne vaidic kii giraftaar kii maang bhi kii
 Earlier, Digvijay tweeted and asked whether Vedic had met Saeed as an NDA government ambassador or Modi's personal envoy? Ved Pratap Vedik meets Hafiz Sayeed
 Any reaction on Social Media ? Did he go as an Envoy of NDA Govt or as a personal Envoy of PM ?— digvijaya singh (@digvijaya_28)july 13, 2014kendriya mantri arun jetali ne bayaan diya ki hafiz said ek aatankwaadi he or vah bharat par hamale kaa aaropee he
 The central government has nothing to do with the hafiz-vedic meeting
 haalanki jetali ke jawaab se congress ke sadsy santusht nahin hue or phir se hangaamaa shuru kar diya
 The Rajya Sabha meeting had to be postponed till 12 noon due to uproar by Congress members
 kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki congress ne sarkaar ko bina notice die rajyasabha ko baadhit kiya he
 This reflects the seriousness of the Congress
 jaavdekar ne kaha, 'chunki arun jetali ne sarkaar kii taraf se sadan main bayaan de diya he, isliye congress ko is masale par shant ho janaa chahie

 However, DMRC said that the decision to increase the rent is not new and it was decided in May itself that the new fare will be applicable from October 1
 metro kaa badha hua kiraaya oktober kii shuruyaat se hi lagu hona tha lekin 1 or 2 oktober kii chuttee ke din metro main riyayati kiraaya lagata he, is vajah se3 oktober se nayaa kirayalagu hoga
 Before the first phase of increased fares was implemented, the minimum fare of the metro was Rs 8, which will now be ten rupees
 jabaki adhiktam kiraaya 30 rupye hota tha, jo may main 50 rupye kiya gaya or ab 3 oktober ke baad 60 rupye ho jayega
 Within the last four months, the fare of the metro will increase hundred percent
 yahi nahin ab 5 se 12 kilometre kii duuri ke liye abhi 15 rupye kiraaya lagata he, jo 3 oktober se 20 rupye ho jayega
 Whereas for the same distance, the fare of the Metro before May was just 12 rupees
 12 se 21 kilometre kii duuri ke liye ab tak metro main 30 rupye lagata he, jo ab 40 rupye ho jayega
 Whereas the maximum fare for this distance was 21 rupees before May
 metro se 21 se 32 kilometre takimetro main safarke liye abhi 40 rupye kiraaya chukaana padataa he, lekin oktober se ye 50 rupye ho jayega
 Whereas before May, the fare for the same distance used to be 25 rupees
 abhi aap agar 32 kilometre se zyada safar karte hai to aapako 50 rupye kiraaye ke taur par chukaane hote hai, lekin oktober se yahi kiraaya 60 rupye ho jayega, jabaki may se pehle 30 rupye hi hua karata tha
 Delhi Metro has reduced the fare slabs, even those traveling for short distances will be hit more by the fare hike, while the maximum fare has been doubled
 haalanki dmarsi ke mutabik chuttee vaale dinon main metro main log riyayati daron par safar kar sakate hai
 On the holiday, the minimum fare of the metro will be Rs 10, while the maximum fare will be charged Rs 50

 Leaks from CEC to CBSE have leaked
 likamay bharat ban gaya he
 On Wednesday, 16 lakh 40 thousand children from all over the country reached home after giving CBSE Class x examination and were preparing to party after the examination was over, then the news of cancellation of the exam made them shiver
 28 march ko ganit ke parche ke saath pariksha samaapt honi thi lekin is faisle ne lakhon maa baap or bacchon ko jhakzor diya he
 i have been doing the same question during my job series for three months
 kya bharat ke naujavaanon ko eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha milegi? jab pradhanmantri ne tanaav dur karne ke liye ek kitaab likhi tab bhi kaha tha ki parikshaarthiyon ke tanaav kaa kaaran pariksha nahin he, pariksha vyavastha he
 Neither there are any tests without theft, nor do the results come without rigging
 agar pariksha kaa system thik kar diya jaae to tanaav nahin hoga
 Then the Prime Minister will not have to spend his significant time writing books to relieve stress
 aaj hi ek noujvaan ne bi aar ambedkar bihar uniwarsity se patr likhaa he ki kai hazaar chaatro kaa riselt ek saal se atka hua he, wo bhi uniwarsity ke kaaran se
 In Bihar, where the leaders are hurting the youth towards the riots
 hamaari naukari or pariksha series kaa yah mul sawaal he ki tay kiijie ki bachche ko dangai bananaa he yaa doctor bananaa he
 CBSE has to cancel the maths exams of class 10 and economics examinations of class 12
 kal se maa baap pareshaan the, kah rahe the ki whatsap uniwarsity main ganit kaa parchaa gum rahaa he, kya sahi he
 Our answer was that before the exam how can we say that this is the same question paper
 shaayad ve sahi nikle, sibiesai ko yah faisla lenaa padaa ki 10veen kii pariksha radd kii jaati he
 Mathematics paper causes stress in the same way, many students are not able to handle its stress, so its exam is kept in the end so that its effect does not spoil the other exams

 aap upi bihar madhya pradesh ke board main ganit kaa riselt dekhie pataa chalegaa ki is ek vishay ne pariksha or padhai ko kitna tanaavpurn bana diya he
 In such a situation, if the question paper started leaking, whatsapp hand written question started to rotate, then think about what would have happened to parents and children in the last two days
 kai maa baap ne email kiya he ki hamaara baccha jo tanaav se guzaregaa uski zimmedaari koun legaa

 desh bhar main parikshaon ke prashn patr li ho rahe hai, unki chintaa ko koi sambodhit nahin karata he
 But here the matter is of that middle class, of those CBSE schools, so the activism of the Prime Minister is also notable
 sutara bataate hai ki pradhanmantri modi prashn patr li hone se naaraaz hai
 In Bihar, students protested at the place in question for leaking of question paper, there was no resentment about it
 rajasthan main rajasthan police sipaahi kii bhartee pariksha main dhaandhlee nahin roak pai, pariksha radd kerani pad gai
 There was no resentment
 uttar pradesh main police bhartee va pronnati board ne computer oparator or lipic kii pariksha kaa aayojan kiya, ek zile main kuch prashnon kii gadabadi ke kaaran lakhon naujavaanon kii ummid par pani phir gaya
 We are not angry that we are not aware of it, but it is that those young people of ordinary families have broken up inside
 kai parikshaon ke riselt do se teen saal main bhi nahin aate hai, use lekar aaj tak koi naaraaz nahin hua
 In Chhapra, lakhs of students at JP University and Bihar University are doing a three-year BA in five to seven years, neither the Prime Minister is angry nor the Chief Minister is angry
 bi aar ambedkar bihar uniwarsity main 2017 main koi pariksha hi nahin hui, koi naaraaz nahin hua
 Therefore, it is better to get angry with the news of resentment that we should look at these examination system properly, leaving all the work for the last three months and doing a job series, but it did not make anyone angry either
 bihar main lakhon chaatr riselt kaa intazaar kar rahe hai magar vahaan kya ho rahaa he aap pataa kiijie
 That is why i say that before the next elections start on the issue arising out of these riots, first decide, children have to be rioted that they have to be doctors
 doctor bananaa he to puuchhie ki har jagah pariksha main chori kyon ho rahi he
 There is no honest examination system in Bhopal nor in Patna nor anywhere in Delhi
 aapane dilli main dekha hoga
 When the students of SSC sat on a dharna in Delhi for several days about rigging in the examination system
 inke dharne ko raajnneetik ke zarie todane kaa prayaas hua, kabhi koching mafia kaa haath bataaya gaya to kabhi kuch magar ye chaatr yahi to kah rahe the ki eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha chahie
 The rigging in the SSC examinations should be investigated by the CBI and the Supreme Court should monitor it
 inaki baat par esayssi ne bhi dhyaan nahin diya magar baad main jab andolan tej hua to kuch parikshaayen radd kerani padin
 Now these students are coming to Delhi again on 31 March
 tab aap tivi khol kar dekhiegaa ki inaki maang par koun sa channel dhyaan detaa he
 CBSE should have been alerted to the rigging of the Staff Selection Commission examination and the movement thereafter
 esayssi ne bhi pehle dhyaan nahin diya magar baad main mana kii li ho sakati he or 21 farvari kii pariksha ko radd karnaa padaa
 Students are demanding that it will happen again
 aaj hi dilli se khabar he ki dilli police ne esayssi kii loar division clerk pariksha paper li maamle main chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 51 lakh cash, 3 laptops, 10 mobile phones, many pen drives and hard disks have been recovered from them
 dilli police or upi estf ne milakar yah oparation kiya he
 On Tuesday, February 28, when thousands of students were taking online exams, the Delhi Police raided them at Gandhi Vihar on the information of UP STF
 ye log online paper kaa samaadhaan kara rahe the
 Online examination is also not free from theft
 iske liye kai flats bhi kiraye par liye gaye the
 This is part of the report of our colleague Mukesh Singh Sengar
 mukesh singh senger kaa kahana he ki in logon ne gandhi vihaar main kareeb 15 computer lab bana rakhe the
 It was here that answers to online questions were prepared
 ek ek chaatr se 15 lakh rupee lekar ye naukariyon main paas kara rahe hai
 According to the police, these people have solved papers of 180 students
 ab agar aap 15 lakh se guna kiijie to yah rakam hoti he 27 karod tak
 Don't you think there will be great people involved in this as well
 police ke mutabik esayssi ne parikshaon kaa tender SIFY naam kii ek company ko diya hua he
 His employees can also join the game
 to kya chaatro kii maang main dam nahin tha ki esayssi kii pariksha main dhaandhlee ho rahi he
 Today, there has been a statement in the newspapers by Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh that SSC Combined Graduate Level 2017 examination will not be repeated
 iskaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota he
 On one hand the Delhi Police is catching the gang of solving online questions in SSC exam, on the other hand the Minister is saying that the question of re-examination does not arise because the question papers leak in the SSC CGL 2017 exam Is not born ye jawaab jitendra singh ne loksabhaa main likhit rup se diya he
 The minister's written answer is something, on the other hand Delhi Police is also arresting 4 people for leaking the exam
 1 agast 2017 ko bhi hamane puraa prime time kiya tha jab news channel hindu muslim dibet dikhaakar aapke bacchon ko dangai banane ke project main khel khel rahe the
 You might have just noticed that Cobra Post has performed a sting operation

 If asked correctly, Delhi Police is doing a good job in the case of question papers leaking
 pichley saal se ham is maamle main dilli police kii kamyaabi ko trek kar rahe hai
 You will know that many private companies, whose number is more than a dozen, are now conducting exams with money
 aisi hi ek company ko theka mila tha National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) kii post graduate pariksha yojit karaane kaa
 It is an American company
 isane dilli police ke saamne mana tha ki pariksha ke system ko koi hack kar saktaa he
 Even then we had raised the question whether we cannot create an honest examination system
 dilli police ne bahut mehnat se chargeshit taiyaar kii he
 Raids in Noida, Chandigarh, arrested four people, but alas the police could not do such a thing
 is maamle main madhyapradesh main hue medical pravesh pariksha kii dhaandhlee ke maamle main cese ladane vaale anand raay ne adaalat main yachika daayar kii thi
 This is another one

 To this day, it is being stolen while we have seen various forms of Vyapam Scam of Madhya Pradesh
 vyapam main 592 logon ke khilaaf chargeshit daayar he
 There is an arrest warrant against 200

 Even after all this, the business continues till today
 kabhi aapane sochaa he ki jab ye chaatr 12veen paas karke college kii taraf jaaenge to vahaan kahaan jaaenge
 Have you ever seen the condition of colleges in the states, you have found out whether there are teachers or not, then find out and then stress about school education
 aapke bacchon ke liye achche college nahin hai
 The leaders have ruined the colleges

 You must have seen in college series college colleges have turned into junk
 kuch college bache hai vahaan bhi nai samasyaayein dastak de rahi hai
 When you hear the news that the government will now tell colleges that you will pay 70 rupees for 100, but you will have to arrange for 30 rupees, take a loan, pay interest, then do you understand what this decision has on your life Will affect

 Today was a big day for students and teachers

 They say that on March 27, the UGC has made it clear that the central government will meet those whose salary comes from the UGC and the Ministry of Human Resources, which have been extended under the Seventh Pay Commission
 yah jeet to he magar yahi baat karmchaariyon ke liye nahin kahi gai he or rajyon ke vishvavidhyalayon ke shikshakon ke liye nahin kahi gai he
 Against this protest, this march has come out

 The condition of colleges across the country is very bad
 itani ki aap agar meri uniwarsity siries ke 27 ank dekh lenge to khaanaa hazam nahin hoga
 As much as the speech is about the Ram Navami procession, the speech is not about the bad condition of the colleges
 dhire-dhire ucch shiksha mahangi hogi to garib se lekar 40-50 hazaar kamaane vaale maa baap apane bacchon ko college main kaise bhej sakenge
 First, no college is left of the state in the state
 baari sankhya main shikshakon kii kami he
 Sushil Mahapatra and Amitesh wanted to know from the students who attended this rally how they understand about these questions
 amitesh se ek lift main ne kaha ki jeenyu vaale pradarshan hi karte rahete hai, jab amitesh ne bataaya ki ve isliye kar rahe hai ki aapke bachche jab college main jaaen to acchhee or sasti shiksha mil sake to vah idhar udhar jhaankne lage
 An assumption has been made, but when facts are presented, it is not made to answer
 aaj hi ek noujvaan ne bi aar ambedkar bihar uniwarsity se patr likhaa he ki kai hazaar chaatro kaa riselt ek saal se atka hua he, wo bhi uniwarsity ke kaaran se
 In Bihar, where the leaders are hurting the youth towards the riots
 hamaari naukari or pariksha series kaa yah mul sawaal he ki tay kiijie ki bachche ko dangai bananaa he yaa doctor bananaa he
 CBSE has to cancel the maths exams of class 10 and economics examinations of class 12
 kal se maa baap pareshaan the, kah rahe the ki whatsap uniwarsity main ganit kaa parchaa gum rahaa he, kya sahi he
 Our answer was that before the exam how can we say that this is the same question paper
 shaayad ve sahi nikle, sibiesai ko yah faisla lenaa padaa ki 10veen kii pariksha radd kii jaati he
 Mathematics paper causes stress in the same way, many students are not able to handle its stress, so its exam is kept in the end so that its effect does not spoil the other exams

 aap upi bihar madhya pradesh ke board main ganit kaa riselt dekhie pataa chalegaa ki is ek vishay ne pariksha or padhai ko kitna tanaavpurn bana diya he
 In such a situation, if the question paper started leaking, whatsapp hand written question started to rotate, then think about what would have happened to parents and children in the last two days

 The question papers of examinations are leaking across the country, no one addresses their concerns
 magar yahaan maamla us middle class kaa he, un sibiesai skulon kaa he, isliye pradhanmantri kii sakriyata bhi ullekhneey he
 Sources reveal that Prime Minister Modi is angry with the question paper leaking
 bihar main daaroga kii pariksha main prashn patr li hone ko lekar kai jagahon par chaatro ne pradarshan kiya, use lekar koi naaraaz nahin hua
 The recruitment of Rajasthan Police constable in Rajasthan could not stop the rigging of the examination, the examination had to be canceled
 koi naaraaz nahin hua
 In Uttar Pradesh, the Police Recruitment and Promotion Board conducted the examination of computer operators and clerks, in a district, due to a few questions, the hope of millions of youth was dashed
 koi naaraaz hua tha, isaki soochna hamen nahin he, magar isaki he ki saadhaaran pariwaron ke ve noujvaan bheetar se tut chuke hai
 Many exam results do not come even in two to three years, till date there was no resentment about it

 At BR Ambedkar Bihar University in 2017, there was no examination, no resentment

 isiilie kahata hum ki isse pehle aglaa chunaav inhen dangon se nikle mudde par hone lage, pehle tay kar lijie, bacchon ko dangai bananaa he ki doctor bananaa he
 If you want to make a doctor, then ask why there is theft in the examination everywhere
 na bhopal main na patna main or na dilli main kahin bhi eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha nahin he
 You must have seen in Delhi
 jab esayssi ke chaatr pariksha vyavastha main dhaandhlee ko lekar kai dinon tak dilli main dharne par baithe rahe
 There was an attempt to break their dharna through political, sometimes they were told the hand of the coaching mafia and sometimes something but these students were saying that honest examination system is needed
 esayssi kii parikshaon main jo dhaandhlee ho rahi he uski jaanch sibiai se ho or supreme court nigaraanee kare
 The SSC did not pay any attention to this, but later, when the movement intensified, some examinations had to be canceled
 ab ye chaatr phir se 31 march ko dilli aa rahe hai
 Then you will open the TV and see which channel pays attention to their demand
 staff salection kamishan kii pariksha main dhaandhlee hone or uske baad andolan se hi sibiesai ko satark ho janaa chahie tha
 SSC also did not pay attention at first but later believed that it could be leaked and the examination of 21 February had to be canceled
 chaatr maang kar rahe hai ki dobaaraa se hogi
 Today it is news from Delhi that Delhi Police has arrested four people in the SSC Lower Division Clerk examination paper leak case
 unke paas se 51 lakh nagad, 3 laptaap, 10 mobile phone, bahut saare pen drive or hard discs baraamad hue hai
 Delhi Police and UP STF have jointly conducted this operation
 mangalvaar yani 28 farvari ko jab hazaron chaatr online pariksha de rahe the tabhi upi estf kii soochna par dilli police ne unke saath gandhi vihaar main chhapemari kii
 These people were providing online paper solutions
 aanaline pariksha bhi chori se mukt nahin he
 Many flats were also rented for this
 hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger kii report kaa yah hissaa he
 Mukesh Singh Sengar says that these people had built about 15 computer labs in Gandhi Vihar
 yaheen se online sawaalon kaa jawaab taiyaar kiya jaataa tha
 They are passing these jobs for 15 lakh rupees from each student
 police ke mutabik ye log 180 chaatro ke paper salve kar chuke hai
 Now if you multiply it by 15 lakhs, then this amount is up to 27 crores
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki isamen bade bade log bhi shaamil honge
 According to the police, SSC has given the tender for the examinations to a company called SIFY
 uske bhi karmchaaree is khel main shaamil ho sakate hai
 So, was there no merit in the demand of the students that SSC examination is being rigged
 aaj hi akhabaaron main carmik rajya mantri jitendra singh kaa bayaan aayaa he ki esayssi kambind graduate level 2017 kii pariksha dobaaraa nahin hogi
 Its question does not arise
 ek taraf dilli police esayssi kii pariksha main online sawaal hal karne ke giroh ko pakad rahi he, duusari taraf mantri kah rahe hai ki dobaaraa pariksha kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota he kyonki esayssi sijiel 2017 kii pariksha main prashn patron ke li hone kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota he
 Jitendra Singh has given this answer in writing in the Lok Sabha
 mantri ji kaa likhit jawaab kuch he, duusari taraf dilli police pariksha li karaane ke maamle main 4 logon ko giraftaar bhi kar rahi he
 We also did full prime time on August 1, 2017, when news channels were playing games in the project of rioting your children by showing Hindu Muslim debates
 abhi aapane dekha hoga ki cobra post ne ek sting oparation kiya he
 People of the channel are raising Hindu Muslim debates with money
 sahi puuchhie to prashn patron ke li hone ke maamle main dilli police acha kaam kar rahi he
 Since last year, we have been tracking the success of Delhi Police in this case
 aapako pataa hoga ki kai privet companiyaan jinaki sankhya darjan se zyaada he ab paise lekar pariksha kaa aayojan kara rahi hai

 You must have seen in Delhi
 jab esayssi ke chaatr pariksha vyavastha main dhaandhlee ko lekar kai dinon tak dilli main dharne par baithe rahe
 There was an attempt to break their dharna through political, sometimes they were told the hand of the coaching mafia and sometimes something but these students were saying that honest examination system is needed
 esayssi kii parikshaon main jo dhaandhlee ho rahi he uski jaanch sibiai se ho or supreme court nigaraanee kare
 The SSC did not pay any attention to this, but later, when the movement intensified, some examinations had to be canceled
 ab ye chaatr phir se 31 march ko dilli aa rahe hai
 Then you will open the TV and see which channel pays attention to their demand
 staff salection kamishan kii pariksha main dhaandhlee hone or uske baad andolan se hi sibiesai ko satark ho janaa chahie tha
 SSC also did not pay attention at first but later believed that it could be leaked and the examination of 21 February had to be canceled
 chaatr maang kar rahe hai ki dobaaraa se hogi
 Today it is news from Delhi that Delhi Police has arrested four people in the SSC Lower Division Clerk examination paper leak case
 unke paas se 51 lakh nagad, 3 laptaap, 10 mobile phone, bahut saare pen drive or hard discs baraamad hue hai

 esayssi ne bhi pehle dhyaan nahin diya magar baad main mana kii li ho sakati he or 21 farvari kii pariksha ko radd karnaa padaa
 Students are demanding that it will happen again

 51 lakh cash, 3 laptops, 10 mobile phones, many pen drives and hard disks have been recovered from them

 On Tuesday, February 28, when thousands of students were taking online exams, the Delhi Police raided them at Gandhi Vihar on the information of UP STF
 ye log online paper kaa samaadhaan kara rahe the
 Online examination is also not free from theft
 iske liye kai flats bhi kiraye par liye gaye the
 This is part of the report of our colleague Mukesh Singh Sengar
 mukesh singh senger kaa kahana he ki in logon ne gandhi vihaar main kareeb 15 computer lab bana rakhe the
 It was here that answers to online questions were prepared
 ek ek chaatr se 15 lakh rupee lekar ye naukariyon main paas kara rahe hai
 According to the police, these people have solved papers of 180 students
 ab agar aap 15 lakh se guna kiijie to yah rakam hoti he 27 karod tak
 Don't you think there will be great people involved in this as well
 police ke mutabik esayssi ne parikshaon kaa tender SIFY naam kii ek company ko diya hua he
 His employees can also join the game
 to kya chaatro kii maang main dam nahin tha ki esayssi kii pariksha main dhaandhlee ho rahi he
 Today, there has been a statement in the newspapers by Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh that SSC Combined Graduate Level 2017 examination will not be repeated
 iskaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota he
 On one hand the Delhi Police is catching the gang of solving online questions in SSC exam, on the other hand the Minister is saying that the question of re-examination does not arise because the question papers leak in the SSC CGL 2017 exam Is not born ye jawaab jitendra singh ne loksabhaa main likhit rup se diya he
 The minister's written answer is something, on the other hand Delhi Police is also arresting 4 people for leaking the exam
 1 agast 2017 ko bhi hamane puraa prime time kiya tha jab news channel hindu muslim dibet dikhaakar aapke bacchon ko dangai banane ke project main khel khel rahe the
 You might have just noticed that Cobra Post has performed a sting operation
 channel ke log paise lekar hindu muslim dibet khadaa kar rahe hai
 If asked correctly, Delhi Police is doing a good job in the case of question papers leaking
 pichley saal se ham is maamle main dilli police kii kamyaabi ko trek kar rahe hai
 You will know that many private companies, whose number is more than a dozen, are now conducting exams with money
 aisi hi ek company ko theka mila tha National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) kii post graduate pariksha yojit karaane kaa
 It is an American company
 isane dilli police ke saamne mana tha ki pariksha ke system ko koi hack kar saktaa he
 Even then we had raised the question whether we cannot create an honest examination system
 dilli police ne bahut mehnat se chargeshit taiyaar kii he
 Raids in Noida, Chandigarh, arrested four people, but alas the police could not do such a thing
 is maamle main madhyapradesh main hue medical pravesh pariksha kii dhaandhlee ke maamle main cese ladane vaale anand raay ne adaalat main yachika daayar kii thi
 This is another one
 sarkaar khud aise maamalon main chaatro kii taraf se cese nahin ladati he, kisi anand raay ko saamne aana padataa he, jokhim uthaanaa padataa he
 To this day, it is being stolen while we have seen various forms of Vyapam Scam of Madhya Pradesh
 vyapam main 592 logon ke khilaaf chargeshit daayar he
 There is an arrest warrant against 200
 is jaanch ko bhi dhimaa kiye jane kii report aap di vir hindi kii website par pard sakate hai
 Even after all this, the business continues till today
 kabhi aapane sochaa he ki jab ye chaatr 12veen paas karke college kii taraf jaaenge to vahaan kahaan jaaenge
 Have you ever seen the condition of colleges in the states, you have found out whether there are teachers or not, then find out and then stress about school education
 aapke bacchon ke liye achche college nahin hai
 The leaders have ruined the colleges
 aapako yakeen na ho to aap rajya bataaiye, vahaan aakar main dikhaa saktaa hum
 You must have seen in college series college colleges have turned into junk
 kuch college bache hai vahaan bhi nai samasyaayein dastak de rahi hai
 When you hear the news that the government will now tell colleges that you will pay 70 rupees for 100, but you will have to arrange for 30 rupees, take a loan, pay interest, then do you understand what this decision has on your life Will affect
 inhen sawaalon ko lekar dilli vishvavidhyalay main ek hafte tak hadtaal rahi he magar kahin koi charchaa nahin
 The comments 28 march ko phir se shikshak or chaatr hazaron kii sankhya main dilli kii sadakon par utre hai
 These included Teachers 'association of most colleges of Delhi University and students' organization AISA, SFI CYSS, KYS, etc
 jamiya millaya islamia ke shikshak sangh or chaatr, jeenyu ke shikshak sangh or chaatr, aligarh muslim uniwarsity ke shikshak or chaatr is march main shaamil hue
 The march has started from Mandi House to Parliament Street
 in collejon ke karmchaaree sanghathanon ne bhi hissaa liya he
 Today was a big day for students and teachers
 is march kaa aahvaan 40 vishvavidhyalayon kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale fedkuta or duuta ne kiya tha
 They say that on March 27, the UGC has made it clear that the central government will meet those whose salary comes from the UGC and the Ministry of Human Resources, which have been extended under the Seventh Pay Commission
 yah jeet to he magar yahi baat karmchaariyon ke liye nahin kahi gai he or rajyon ke vishvavidhyalayon ke shikshakon ke liye nahin kahi gai he
 Against this protest, this march has come out
 isamen kai mudde shaamil hai
 There was no decision on the matter of pension of teachers
 hazaron kii sankhya main edaha shikshak bhi apni niyukti ko lekar is march main shaamil hue
 There was an issue of autonomy
 haal hi main jeenyu ke shikshakon or chaatro ne maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke atonami ke faisle ke virodh main jeenyu se sansad tak kaa march nikaala tha
 The condition of colleges across the country is very bad
 itani ki aap agar meri uniwarsity siries ke 27 ank dekh lenge to khaanaa hazam nahin hoga
 As much as the speech is about the Ram Navami procession, the speech is not about the bad condition of the colleges
 dhire-dhire ucch shiksha mahangi hogi to garib se lekar 40-50 hazaar kamaane vaale maa baap apane bacchon ko college main kaise bhej sakenge
 First, no college is left of the state in the state
 baari sankhya main shikshakon kii kami he
 Sushil Mahapatra and Amitesh wanted to know from the students who attended this rally how they understand about these questions
 amitesh se ek lift main ne kaha ki jeenyu vaale pradarshan hi karte rahete hai, jab amitesh ne bataaya ki ve isliye kar rahe hai ki aapke bachche jab college main jaaen to acchhee or sasti shiksha mil sake to vah idhar udhar jhaankne lage
 An assumption has been made, but when facts are presented, it is not made to answer
 mangalvaar yani 28 farvari ko jab hazaron chaatr online pariksha de rahe the tabhi upi estf kii soochna par dilli police ne unke saath gandhi vihaar main chhapemari kii

 pyaar main aise daur bhi aate hai, jab aap inasexor feel karne lagate hai
 You start teasing on the matter, because your partner is slowly getting away from you
 relationships main wo spark khatm hone lagata he, jo aap donon ke bich kabhi hua karata tha
 Maybe this fear of yours is baseless, because every person's behavior changes over time
 isliye kisi nattejey par pahunchane se pehle apane rishte main gunjaaishon ko dekh or parakh len
 But how
 
 
 jab saathi ke vyavhaar main ye 5 baaten dikhen, to samaj len ki use ab aapse pyaar nahin rahaa
 Now you should also move on
 
 
 aapako or unako kareeb le aegi ek chutki hing, jaane kaiseuske future plan main aap nahinaya-nayaa pyaar ho yaa nai-nai shaadi, donon hi sthtiyon main hi parteners milakar ghanton future planning karte hai
 If this is not happening to you and your partner is not taking any interest in your future planning or does not talk to you to pursue the relationship then this can be an alarming sign for you
 ladke ek najar main parakhte hai marij materialamasej kaa na de jawababaar-baar massej karne ke baavjood agar aapkaa partner jawaab nahin detaa he yaa hameshaa bahut der baad detaa he to aap isse andaja laga sakati hai ki vah aapako ignor karne kii koshish kar rahaa he or is rishte main uski dilchaspee khatm ho gai he
 Do not Ignore these 5 things at the beginning of the relationship
 If both of you are employed, then obviously you both will lack time
 aise main saath samay bitaane ke liye aap koshish karti hai, dinar kaa plan banaati he yaa veekend par movie dekhne kii yojana banaati he, par aapkaa saathi aisa nahin karata
 Instead, he focuses only on work and then you should not delay to understand that your partner is not interested in you
 ye 5 baaten kar dengi conform, aapako ho gaya he lovebara-baar ginaae galtiyanrishte main saathi ek duusare kii kamiyon ko agar chhupate nahin to baar-baar uskaa ehsaas bhi nahin karaate
 But this is not happening in your case and your partner keeps counting your small mistakes and shortcomings, even if you fret needlessly, you should understand that he no longer loves you
 jab partner kare ignor to kuch aisa aajamaayenpyar na karedo log jab pyaar main hote hai to unka kareeb aana laazmi he
 If your partner is not coming close to you or expressing his love in any way despite being married, then you should be careful
 kyonki isse yah saaf sabit hota he ki aapke partner ko aapse muhobbat nahin rahi
 See these 5 things in a partner, then move back from the relationship karina kapur khan or saf ali khan ke bete taimur ali khan bollywood ke most popular starchid hai

 After the completion of two matches of the Test series between India and New Zealand, Team India has an unassailable 2-0 lead
 is jeet ke sahare bhartiya team ne na sirf test ranking main top sthaan hasil kar liya he balki gharelu maidan par apni badshahath ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Although the matches held in Kanpur and Kolkata under the series, Team India maintained their dominance, but the matches so far under the series will be remembered for one more thing
 siries ke donon maichon main ab tak 16 ardhashatak jamaaye ja chuke hai, lekin shatak kii pratiksha kar rahe cricketpremiyon kaa intjaar abhi bhi puraa nahin ho sakaa he
 Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara in the first innings for India in the Kanpur Test and Vijay, Pujara, Rohit Sharma and Jadeja in the second innings scored half-centuries, while New Zealand's opener Tom Latham and captain Kane Williamson in the first innings while Luke in the second innings Ronchi and Mitchell Sentner were successful in scoring centuries
 isamen se ronchi to 80 kii ransankhya tak pahunche lekin shatak puraa nahin kar sake
 The comments kolkata ke duusare test main bhi yahi kahani doharaai gai
 Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane and Wriddhiman Saha scored half-centuries in the first innings for India, while Rohit Sharma and Saha (half-centuries in the first innings) did the same in the second innings
 newjiland ke liye match kaa ekmaatr ardhashatak uske openar latham ne jamaaya
 In this test, Cheteshwar Pujara scored 87 in India's first innings and Rohit Sharma scored 82 runs in the second innings but the century could not be scored in this match
 vaise bhi siries main ballebaaj kii tulana main gendbaajon kaa varchasv rahaa he
 Neither team crossed the 400-run mark in both the matches and the second test of the Kanpur Test was 377 for 5 wickets (innings declared) till date
 siries kaa teesraa or antim match 8 oktober se indore main khelaa janaa he
 It remains to be seen whether this wait for the century of sports enthusiasts can be completed there too

 The same story was repeated in the second test of Kolkata
 bharat ke liye pehali pari main cheteshwar pujaara, ajinkya rahane or riddhimaan saaha ne ardhashatak jamaaye jabaki duusari pari main yah kaam rohit sharma or saaha (pehali pari main bhi ardhashatak) ne kiya
 The only half-century of the match for New Zealand was scored by Latham
 is test main bharat kii pehali pari main cheteshwar pujaara ne 87 or duusari pari main rohit sharma ne 82 ran banaae lekin shatak is match main bhi nahin ban paaya
 Anyway, the series has been dominated by bowlers compared to batsmen
 donon maichon main koi bhi team 400 ran kaa aankada paar nahin kar pai or kanpur test kii duusari pari kaa 5 wicket par 377 ran (pari ghoshit) ab tak kaa sarvocch score rahaa he
 The third and final match of the series is to be played in Indore from 8 October
 dekhnaa he ki khelpremiyon kaa shatak kaa yah intjaar vahaan bhi puraa ho saktaa he yaa nahin

 rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal ke bete shaury dobhaal ne aakhirkaar apane foundation ko lekar lagaae gaye aaropon par chuppi todi he
 Shaurya Doval has said during a news channel program that the accusers should prove the allegations
 ullekhneey he ki samachar website da vir kii report main shaury dobhaal ke 'india foundation' par hiton ke takaraav or lobying karne ke liye sarkaar main maujuud foundation ke sadasyon ke prabhaav kaa istemaal karnaa kaa mudda uthaaya he
 Shaurya Doval is the director of the India Foundation
 da vir kii report ke anusaar india foundation desh ke top think tanks main se ek he, jiske sadsy chaar varisht mantri hai
 The report claims the inclusion of ministers of the Modi government in the 'india Foundation' and the foundation to benefit from domestic and foreign companies
 shaury dobhaal ne kaha, "raajnneetik bahason main koi kuch bhi kah saktaa he
 This is a democracy
 lekin adaalat main unhen apane aarope sabit karne chahie
 Whoever is making the allegations, they should prove their charges in the court in a logical manner if they take the court's way
 or agar ve court nahin janaa chaahate or sirf bahes ke str par ise uthaa rahe hai to use janata ke bich le jaaie or janata ke saamne apane percepshan ko sabit karen
 "in another report by The Wire, Shaurya Doval on the issue raised about the company of Jai Shah, son of BJP President Amit Shah, said," BJP has no problem in taking any issue of corruption to court, and Congress Neither should it
 agar ve maanate hai ki BJP bhrasht he to unhen nyaay kaa rasta apnaanaa chahie or maamle ko court main le janaa chahie
 There is a court for such cases
 "haalanki shaury dobhaal ne yah spasht nahin kiya ki apane khilaaf uthaae gaye is maamle main vah court kaa raast akhriyaar karenge yaa nahin
 On the question of filing a court case, Shaurya Doval said, "I am saying that the court is a way to prove an allegation and that a person convicted by the court should be ready to face the punishment
 "kai mantriyon se india foundation kaa judaavye bhi daawa kiya gaya he ki 'india foundation' ko shaury dowaal or bijepi ke rashtriya mahasachiv ram madhav chalaate hai
 Also on its board are Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu and Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha and Minister of State for External Affairs MJ Akbar
 news report main ye bhi daawa kiya gaya he ki foundation kaa apaardarshee vittiya len-dein or kendriya cabinet ke varisht mantriyon kaa isamen diarector hona kai tarah ke sawaal khadey karata he
 This is also because Shaurya Doval, the executive director of the organization, himself runs a firm called Gemini Financial Services, which deals with the economies of Asian and other countries
 news report main in tathyon kii daleel dete hue hiton ke takaraav kaa daawa kiya gaya he
 Answers to unanswered questions: The website has also claimed that the institute runs a trust, so it is not legally necessary to make the balance sheet public
 vahiin ye bhi daawa kiya gaya he ki santhaan kendriya mantriyon ke jude hone ke baavjood usne apane inakam sorce bataane se inkaar kar diya he
 The website has claimed no response from 6 people associated with the foundation even when they ask questions in this regard
 haalanki, ye bhi likhaa gaya he ki shaury dowaal ne conference, vigyaapan or jarnal se foundation ko kamai ko hone kii baat kahi he

 BJP not against reservation in temples
 Christian Dalits are not found in temples
 Andhra Pradesh government has given 50 percent reservation to SC, ST, backward classes and women in temples
 vahiin bijepi ne jaganmohan reddy sarkaar ke is faisle ko hindu bhaavana ke khilaaf bataaya he
 a BJP leader from Andhra Pradesh says that the state government should ensure that Dalits who have become Christians are not nominated to any position in Hindu temples
 isaayiyon kii niyukti ke khilaaf bijepitidipi chhod kar bijepi jwoin karne vaale lanka dinaakar ne kaha ki unki party is 50 fisadi aarakshan ke khilaaf nahin he
 But the party is definitely worried about the inclusion of Christians in the managing trust of Hindu temples
 lanka dinaakar ne kaha, 'andhra pradesh main jo satta main aata he un sab kii najar hindu mandiron or unki jameenon par rahati he
 He said, is it not true that Hindu Dalits who have become Christians remain Dalits for a lifetime
 kya yah sach nahin he ki sabhi dalon ke dharm badalane vaale rajaneta saarvajanik taur par daliton ke naam par pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Is this not an injustice to Dalits? The BJP leader said that Dalits have got reservation on designated posts in Hindu temples in Andhra Pradesh
 hamaari maang he ki in padon par sirf hindu daliton ko hi namit kiya jaae
 But it seems that religiously converted Dalits are being allowed to appoint these posts, who will continue to represent the Dalit class while holding these public posts
 agar sarkaar dharm parivartan karne vaale daliton ko in mandiron main niyukt karti he ye niyuktiyaan hindu bhaavana ke khilaaf hogi
 What is the decision of Jagan government that it is 50 percent reservation for Backward Classes (BC), Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) and 50 percent for women
 iske tahat ab har board of trustee main anusuchit jati, anusuchit janajati or pichde varg ke ummidavaaron ke liye namit sadasyon kii kul sankhya (paden sadasyon ko chhodkar) main se 50 fisadi aarakshan hoga
 Apart from this, 50 percent of the total nominated members will be women, including women members nominated under the quota 50 percent from SC / ST and BC category
 isse pehle jaganmohan reddy sarkaar ne nigamon, bordon, socitis or bazaar kaary sthalon main pichhadaa varg, essi, asti or alpsankhyak varg ko 50 pratishat aarakshan dene kaa elaan kiya tha

 The BJP candidate for the prime minister has taken a new avatar as a tech-savvy modernist, embarking on his final struggle for power
 aaj ve jis mukaam tak aa pahunche hai usamen is baat kaa koi yogadan nahin he ki ve jameen se 30,000 foot se adhik kii oonchai par 400 mile prati ghanta kii raftaar se yatraaen karte hai, bhale hi unke hoker ekjicutive jet kii khidakiyon ko sahalaakar guzarane vaale badal unke kaanon main fusfusaakar divya sandesh dete hon
 Anyway, this traveler has always been known to communicate with God
 bhartiya raajnneeti main lambii duuri ke is rath arohi ne vivaadaaspad puranic sthalon or sabhyataa ke pracheen khandhiron kii yatra kii or hinduon ko unke devataaon se vanchit karne vaali rajya-vyavastha ke viruddh lamaband kiya
 They were nationalists riding the chariot, which converted religious dissent into a historic vote
 is vot ne bharat ko raamarajy to nahin, lekin uski pehali dakshinpanthi sarkaar jarur di
 But it was not his government
 us sarkaar kaa puraa kaa puraa shrey aise vyakti ko gaya jisane gati kii jagah nishchalata, bikharaav kii bajaae samuhikta ko variyata di
 It was a short-lived romance and a highly absurd slogan that led to the abolition of power and the beginning of defeat
 yah athak yatri, niraashaa ke biabaan main bhi ummid kii kirane talash rahaa tha
 He also saw a ray of hope, but across the border at the tomb of Jinnah in Karachi, which no one had even imagined
 unhone islamic ganatantr ke sansthaapak kii dharmanirpeksh aatma kii punarkhoj to kii, lekin yah jitna dussahaspurn tha, utana hi aatmghaatee bhi
 But that traveler kept moving forward, even when his own party abandoned him
 lekin aage kaa rasta uske liye khatm nahin hua tha or party ne bharat kii satta dobaaraa hasil karne ke liye use aam raay se pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya
 Clearly, LK Advani needs a vehicle much higher than the Toyota engine fitted chariot
 aakhir yah unke liye ‘abhi yaa kabhi nahin’ jaisi sthiti he
 It has "just now" rooted in the confidence of an 81-year-old man who has turned his biggest struggle into a war, denying the limits of biology and ideology, with the goal: double evil to India - "a weak Prime Minister" And a "non-constitutional powerful dynasty" - to liberate
 jab ve apana pasandida jaayakedaar doodh pite hue apane jet kii seat par aaraam ke liye peeche adte hai, to unamem party ke aise akele netaa ke rup main ubharne kaa aatmavishvaas spasht dikhataa he jo satta ke khilaaf nahin, balki satta ke liye lard rahaa he
 Inspired by Barack Obama, he is leading the campaign in a truly American presidential election campaign style
 yah ‘pradhanmantri pad ke liye adwani’ yaa ‘majboot netaa, nirnaayak sarkaar’ jaisi prachaar saamagree se hi spasht nahin he
 Actually, the entire campaign has become a kind of opinion about Advani
 yah vastutah ‘adwani banaam anya’ kii ladaai he
 They are messages themselves and also messengers
 so, unase jab aap poochhate hai ki ‘kya aap sochate hai ki sansadeey chunaav ke nattejey bhi america raashtrapati ke chunaav jaise honge? yah adwani ke liye vot hoga yaa bhaajapa ke liye?’ to ve pehle bachaav kii mudra aa jate hai, ‘hamaare yahaan sansadeey pranali he
 
 
 'but the whole campaign is focused on you?' It is possible, this is not the time to show weakness or regret about something for which they can fully take responsibility, so they accept, 'what's wrong with this
 yah koi nai baat nahin he
 The party leader has been leading the election campaign since the days of Nehru
 ’phir bhi, ve us yatri kii tarah manzil par nahin pahunchnaa chaahate, jo ateet ke vikrut boj se dabaa ho
 But they cannot even get rid of that burden completely
 ateet parivartan or punarnirmaan kii kahani hota he
 At every stop, this traveler, whether it has been Ayodhya or Delhi or Karachi, has acquired an identity that does not match the thinking of leftists and liberals of India
 aaj adwani chaahe bhaashan de rahe hon yaa baatcheet kar rahe hon, ve apane vikaas kii kahani ko phir nayaa mode de rahe hai or iskaa pehla pratik iphone nahin he jise ve saath lekar chalate hai
 That new twist reflects in his vocabulary
 unase unke sabase bade sandesh ke bare main puuchhie to ve turant kahenge, ‘beesvin sadi main vigyaan kaa sabase bada yogadan internet connactivity thi
 We want every boy, every girl in this country to be computer literate
 ’ unke chunavi daure main hameshaa unke saath rahane vaale vishwaasapaatr deepak chopra ko lagata he ki adwani electronic kii bhulbhulaiya main kho sakate hai, lihaaja, ve ity ke prati party ke nazariye ke bare main ek pustika dete hai jiskaa sheershak ‘bharat kaa kayapalat’ he
 It has chapters like digital highways, e-governance for good governance and e-development for all
 vaajapeyi ne kabhi aahvaan kiya tha-‘sau bangaloron ko ubharne do!’ pustika main us aahvaan kaa vistaar karte hue i-swarg banane kaa vaada kiya gaya he, jahaan shiksha or swasthya paricharya se lekar vyaktigat pahchaan or rashtriya suraksha tak digital hogi
 It also promises a corruption-free India
 adwani kehete hai, ‘aakhir, yuvak hamaari shakti hai
 'but you are not so young
 ‘umr koi myne nahin rakhti
 History is full of old people who brought revolutionary changes in the world
 gandhi or jaiprakash narayan jaise netaa isaki misaal hai
 'it is not that they have forgotten the youth, especially some talented youth
 ‘to aap yah kah rahe hai ki aap umr ke saath adhik samajhadaar hote ja rahe hai?’ is sawaal ke jawaab main ve ek kahani bataate hai ki kis tarah vinoba bhaave ne quran ko mul arabi main padhane ke liye tirapan saal kii umr main arabi sikhi
 Story Lesson: Advani is getting younger, but not entirely in the Benjamin Button style
 phir bhi, yah ek aise shaks kaa anoothaa maamla he jo mouse ke clic ke saath puraanon se nikal technology ke yug main pravesh kar chukaa he
 Even at this age, this youthfulness emerges clearly when they are on the battlefield
 ve jab jet se utarkar helicopter main baithte hai or helicopter se nikalakar kesaria rang main range manch par jate hai to unke chehre par thakaan kaa koi lakshan nahin dikhataa
 Nevertheless, he talks directly of issues rather than entertaining the crowd with a speech like Vajpayee or Narendra Modi
 jharkhand main simdega, lohardagga or dhanbad jaisi jagahon par ve bhadakaau bhaashan nahin dete, balki pravachan dene vaale kii bhoomika main hote hai
 They say to the poor berry-eating poor of this dry region that they will make the 21st century India's century
 ve unhen computer kii shiksha dene kaa vaada karte hai; congress shasit bharat ke santras ke bare main bataate hai jiske kaaran kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe hai, aatankwaadi hamale ho rahe hai, mahangaai bad rahi he or desh kii suraksha kii keemat par vot bank kii raajnneeti ho rahi he
 They are particularly concerned about the girl child, 'when a girl is born, one should not grieve
 vah saraswati hoti he
 He should be given proper education
 ‘pradhanmantri banane ke baad adwani pakkaa karenge ki balikaon ko samuchit shiksha mili
 They tell the people, 'bjp's victory will be India's victory
 ’ adwani sweekaar karte hai ve keval apane shabdon kii takat ke boote nahin jeet sakate
 They do not specialize in soundbite
 agali raily main jane ke liye bel 412 helicopter main baithkar ve kehete hai, ‘main vaajapeyi kii tarah kushal vaktaa nahin hum
 They could play with words
 isliye main sanghathan sanbhaalanaa chahta tha
 "then he regrets," There is no one to run the election campaign in Congress
 uske paas aisa netaa he jo logon ko pasand nahin karata
 'so, in the form of Advani you come across a leader who wants to win the power of India as an advocate of modernity and a humble person
 haalanki unka najariya digital vishaywastu ke maamle main samrudh he, lekin usamen vartmaan daur kii chintaaon or niraashaa ko lakshya banane vaale aarthik sandesh kaa abhaav he
 Even the election manifesto of the BJP does not clearly mention any economic agenda, at a time when the world is reeling from the Great Recession
 adwani kaa aarthik agenda kya he? ve kehete hai, ‘aisi kai chijen hai jo sarkaar ko kerani chahie
 They do not need to be included in the election manifesto
 ’ vaise, chunaav ghoshnaptr main kaha gaya he ki bhaajapa satta main aane ke baad khudara kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh kii ijaajat nahin degi
 Perhaps the reason behind this promise is that the party wants to keep its traditional vote bank, small traders happy
 ‘hamen har haal main krishi kshetra par jor dena chahie
 The economy cannot boom when thousands of farmers are committing suicide
 bharat main bhi aisa pehle kabhi nahin hua
 Despite our stance on FDI, we have always been against the license-permit raj
 jab narsingh raav sarkaar ne bazaar mukt kiya to hamane uskaa swaagat kiya
 But it is not in India's interest to copy everything western
 ’‘kya yah ajeeb nahin he ki aadhuniktaa ke pairokaar ke paas aadhunik aarthik agenda nahin he
 Doesn't it come as a surprise when the rightists have won a historic victory in the economic debate? "I know there are some oddities
 ’‘kuch had tak kya yah aapaki raajnneeti main bhi nahin he? ummidavaar adwani ek narampanthi rajnatik vyakti ke rup main saamne aate hai, jo apane bhaashan main hindutv kii baat shaayad hi karte hai
 But was it right for Varun to come to the rescue? You could also ignore them
 ’‘main apane hi janaadhar ke bheetar ek duusare tarah ke vivaad main ghir jaataa
 To create your own image, you cannot ignore practicality
 unhone kathith rup se jo kuch kaha, party ne khud ko usase puri tarah alag kar liya
 But the Election Commission over-exercised its authority
 un par rasuka lagaana rajnatik vikruti he
 i did not compare him to JP
 maine keval yah kaha ki ek chunavi pratidwandvi ke khilaaf isliye sakht kanoon kaa istemaal kiya gaya ki vah jail se chunaav haar jaae
 George Fernandes and Nanaji Deshmukh won the elections with an overwhelming majority while in jail
 yah bhaajapa or basapa ke bich kii ladaai ban gai he
 The BSP is taking these steps to appease Muslim voters
 ’lekin bada sawaal yah he ki kya adwani ne avasar kaa laabh uthaaya he? unke liye sandarbh hajir hai-bharat hamale kii jad main he or bazaar main niraashaa he
 Do they have issues that can turn the ever-growing disillusionment into a movement for change? Advani and his managers believe that they are ready to put an end to part-time politics
 unhone apane vichaarkon se pehle hi kah diya he ki ve ‘pehle 100 dinon main kiye jane vaale kaam kii ruparekha banaaen
 Their broad objective is to 'eliminate the current situation of doubt and frustration and to build people's trust in a public interest government'
 jab ve apane maharashtra daure ke pehle padaav pangarpur main pahunche to dholkon kii thap se unka swaagat aise vyakti ke rup main kiya gaya, jo sahi myne main uddharak bananaa chahta he
 It is already quite evening here and he has yet to address another rally in Shivgaon
 ve prerana se bhare hue hai or logon ko ek alokapriy sultan kii kahani bataanaa chaahate hai jo us kshetra main kabhi raaj karata tha
 Once there was a famine, thousands of people died
 sultan ke anaaj bhandar bhare the
 His saintly heart minister opened the stores so that every man breathed a sigh of relief
 sultan ne apane mantri se prati kii keemat chukaane ko kaha
 Ultimately, due to a divine intervention, Sultan's pride was crushed and his cruelty also ended
 ‘acha raja vahi hota he jo janata kaa dhyaan rakhata he or yadi main pradhanmantri banataa hum to bharat kaa pehla sevak rahoonga
 'and Advani himself starts playing the dhol, which is his rare performance
 kisi samay is tarah kaa pradarshan is rashtravaadi ke utkarsh kaa udghosh hota tha, jiske saare tark hindutv par aadhaarit hote the
 Today, he seems to have realized that he does not need to emphasize so much on such things
 to, kya ab ve aadhunik banane ke liye hindutv ko lekar kam mukhar honge? is parivartan se jo log jhatka kha chuke hai, ve kehete hai: modi ko dekhie, jinhone aadhunikeekaran ke agenda or sangh parivaar kii mul vichaardhaara ke bich acha santulan saadhaa he
 Advani is aware of this concept
 ‘main apni koshish main laga hum
 i am trying to create dialogue in a language that is valid for the whole country
 narendra modi yaa to gujarat ko dekh rahe hai yaa phir desh kii aabaadi ke ek tabake kaa dhyaan rakh rahe hai jise hindu hone par khed nahin he
 'then they argue,' India is secular only because it is a Hindu country
 jab pakistan ne khud ko islamic rajya ghoshit kiya to swaabhaavik nateeja yah nikalnaa chahie tha ki bharat bhi apane ko hindu desh ghoshit kar detaa
 but that did not happen
 congressi daawa kar sakate hai ki congress ke kaaran bharat hindu desh ghoshit nahin hua
 But this is not correct because no one in the Constituent Assembly suggested that we declare ourselves a Hindu state
 ’ phir, yah raamarajy kahaan se aayega? ‘yah adarsh rajya kii avadharana he or mujhe isamen koi buraai nahin dikhti
 Despite this, the party and its prime ministerial candidates are struggling with image crisis
 shaayad isliye ki desh ayodhya se abhi tak nahin ubar paaya he
 Advani is not too worried about the issue as he is running his own campaign
 unka abhiyaan ek avadharana se judaa hua he jise adwani kehete hai
 The management of his campaign is in the hands of people who do not follow the organizational hierarchy
 adwani maanate hai ki hawa badal rahi he
 'the UPA has completely disintegrated
 hamane keval ek ghatak khoyaa he, vah bhi uske ati aatmavishvaas ke kaaran
 We in Odisha are trying to convert our adversity into profit, although we never expected Naveen Patnaik to do so
 ’ party yaa adwani use taal sakate the
 On the other hand, some allies like Nitish Kumar are not very impressed with the nda's prime ministerial candidate
 adwani ke vyaktitv prerit abhiyaan main sahyogi adhik mahatv nahin rakhte
 He has introduced himself to the public court
 janata ko unki kismat kaa panch banane kaa mauka kabhi nahin mila tha, unke bare main logon ne jarur ek dharna bana rakhi he
 s
 gurumurti sareekhe unke kattar samarthak or salaahkaar unhen luptpraaya prajati ke antim jeev maanate hai
 'advani's commitment to honesty and truth in a shameless state is beyond doubt
 ’ kuch ke liye ve hindu rashtravaadi hai jisane bharat kii soch ko baantne ke liye puraanon kaa istemaal kiya
 However, it is up to the public to adopt or reject them
 is baar unase shrey yaa pidaa baantne ke liye koi nahin kah saktaa
 Credit will be theirs and theirs will also suffer
 yah sab kuch jeevani sareekha hoga, kyonki vichaardhaara lacheelee hoti he
 His journey started from Karachi more than 60 years ago when a student of the St
 Patrick's High School for Boys walked through the tennis court to the nearby RSS branch
 tab se vah yatra karte hue kabhi nahin thakaa
 Still not
 lekin unka dhairya chuktaa ja rahaa he
 This time they have to win more than logic, in the electoral war
 unhen ek aise desh ko jeetna hoga jo, unke khyaal se, unhen kabhi nahin samaj sakaa

 ' a Mumbai court on Saturday sent Gurunath Meiyappan to police custody till May 29 in the latest spot-fixing case in the current edition of the IPL
 bisisiai adhyaksh en
 Srinivasan's son-in-law Meiyappan was produced in the court on Saturday after being arrested on Friday night
 police ke vakil waajid shaikh ne mayppan se poochtacha karne ke liye saat dinon ke hiraasat kii maang kii
 Sheikh's demand was strongly opposed by his opposition lawyer Harshad Ponda
 ponda ne tark diya ki mayppan ne spot phixing kii jaanch main sahyog karne ke liye swechha se police se sampark kiya, isliye unhen hiraasat main bhejnaa uchit nahin hoga
 Police said they have recovered four mobiles from Meiyappan, which they want permission to investigate so that Meiyappan's involvement in spot-fixing can be confirmed
 iske alaava police ne mayppan or kuch sattebaajon ke bich telephone par hui baatcheet ko bhi record kiya he, jiskaa milan ve mayppan kii aawaaj se karnaa chaahate hai
 Meiyappan, arrested by the Mumbai police in the spot-fixing case, had sought time till Monday, but his plea was rejected
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki modi ne bhrashtachar khatm karne ke liye naaraa diya tha ‘ na khaauungaa, na khaane duungaa’
 But crores of crores of rupees involving people like Lalit Modi, Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi came out which proved that all the slogans of Narendra Modi are hollow
 (input bhashaa se) Just think how it would be if you had a chance to slip instead of walking on the road
 ji haa, wo bhi shahar kii mukhya sadak par or koi rokane vaala nahin
 Slider-like experience like a water park
 yakeenan yah romaanchak hoga or jald hi britain main bristol hai street par logon ko iskaa anubhav karne ko milegaa
 Actually, all this is the brainchild of an artist, which will be realized someday in May with the help of a local council of Britain
 angreji website 'gijmodo' par jari khabar ke anusaar haal hi iskaa test ride kiya gaya he, jo safal bhi rahaa he
 It will be organized under 'car Free Jolly Good Times', which will help people in thrill as well as reduce the movement of trains on the road one day
 ise dizin karne vaale luk jeram kehete hai, 'mujhe khushi he ki ise saakaar karne main council madad kar rahi he
 However, i am trying hard not to let anything go wrong on one occasion and people can slide easily
 is ore sabase badi jimmedaari ise logon ke liye surakshit banane kii he

 chidambaram ne somvaar ko kaha ki jammu kshetra main hinsa main teen logon kii maut hui he
 He also said that the government would not allow anyone from the state to be forced to emigrate like in the 1990s
 chidambaram kaa bayaan kashmir main 1990 main aatankwaad ke kaaran ghati se kashmiri panditon ke palaayan ke sandarbh main tha
 He told the Rajya Sabha that the situation has come under control in the violence-hit Jammu region and three people have died
 chidambaram ne kaha,"ab tak hinsa main do muslimon or ek hindu kii maut hui he
 We are all Indians

 " iske pehle rajyasabha main netaa pratipaksh arun jetali ne aatankwaad kii shuruyaat kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha, "yadi sthiti par kaabo nahin paaya gaya to 1990 ke dashak jaisi sthiti paidaa ho jaaegi

 This is a threat to India's sovereignty

 It should be investigated
 " unhone kaha ki unke daure se keval tanaav kam ho saktaa tha
 Chidambaram's statement was in reference to the migration of Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley due to terrorism in Kashmir in 1990
 unhone rajyasabha ko bataaya ki hinsa prabhavit jammu kshetra main sthiti niyantran main aa gai he or teen logon kii maut hui he

 " Earlier in the Rajya Sabha, Leader of Opposition Arun Jaitley pointed to the onset of terrorism, saying, "if the situation is not controlled, a situation like the 1990s would arise
" " Jaitley said on Monday that violence in Kishtwar town of Jammu and Kashmir is not just a communal riot, but also a threat to India's sovereignty
 jetali ne rajyasabha main kaha, "yah samudaayon ke bich kaa aapasi jhagada nahin he
 The flag of the neighboring country is not waved in community fights
