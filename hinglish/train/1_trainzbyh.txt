 livis milicia ke adhikariyon ne bataaya ki do hamalavar bas ke bheetar ghus aae or unhone yatriyon par petrol chhidakane ke baad bas ko aag laga di
 The dead and injured were rushed to Sibi Hospital, where officials have described the condition of some of the injured as very critical

 If you want to do survey on roofs, then you should go to Kinanagar village of Meerut
 is gaanv main sabhi jatiyon ne apni-apni pasand kii partiyon ke jhande chhaton par taang die hai
 You can count these flags and how many votes will be won by Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and how many will be given to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or Samajwadi Party (SP)
 chhaton par laharaaten ye rangeen jhande bataa rahe hai ki kisi ek party ke paksh main lahar nahin he
 There are all castes in this village according to population, but Jatav society ranks first in terms of plurality
 yahaan jatvon ke chah hazaar vot hai
 The Jatavs are considered supporters of the BSP and the Jatavs own 70 percent of the Dalit community in Uttar Pradesh
 gaanv main ghuste hi jatvon kaa mohalla padataa he
 bsp's blue flag is installed on everyone's roofs
 jatvon ke mohalle main kisi duusari party kaa jhanda he hi nahin
 The people here say that they only vote for the BSP, but they are also sad that the candidates of the other party do not come to ask for the vote to perform the formalities
 aate to ek vot to miltaa
 We also saw this
 us gaanv main sapa ummidavaar kii choti sabha thi, balmiki basti main
 The candidate's convoy did not stop at the locality of six thousand votes
 sidhaa maatr saadhe teen sau vot vaali balmiki basti main chalaa gaya
 People of Jatav community said that BJP candidates also went without asking for votes
 zaahir he, sab party kaa apana vot bank he
 Whose number is low and which has no party of its own, it has killed all the parties
 khayr, main jab jatvon ke mohalle se nikalakar savarnon kii taraf gaya to unki chhaton par sirf bijepi ke jhande laharaa rahe the
 BJP flag on Thakurs and Brahmin houses
 saaf-saaf dikh rahaa tha ki bijepi kii taraf kis jati kaa jhukaav he
 As soon as we got out from there to the Muslim neighborhood, only the flags of the Samajwadi Party were waving on their roofs
 yani, in jhandon ko ginakar aap bataa sakate hai ki is gaanv main kis party ke saath koun jati he or kitna vot he
 Caste relations have improved, but there is still no change in political relations
 cricket par jaan lutaaney vaale thakuron ko is baat kaa garv bhi nahin ki unke gaanv kaa koi dalit cricket kii gend banaata he or duusari taraf shoshit jatav samaaj balmiki samudaay ko apane se kam samajhataa he
 No party fought against caste in this election
 jin dalon or netaaon ne baat bhi kii, ve jati ke hisaab se ummidavaar utaarne lage or jati ke vot ke liye dalon se samjhauta karne lage

 Congress is releasing list of candidates for Lok Sabha Polls 2019
 congress ne shanivaar ko apni jo aathvin suchi jari kii he or usamen congress ke digvijay singh kaa naam bhi shaamil he
 According to the list released on Saturday night, the party has nominated senior leader Digvijay Singh from Bhopal
 madhya pradesh main bhopal ko congress ke lihaaj se sabase mushkil or kathin siton main gina jaataa he or is baar is seat ko jitaane kaa daaromadar digvijay singh ko diya gaya he
 If sources are to be believed, the strategy of the Congress is to field tough leaders on tough seats so that the Congress can somehow take over that seat
 darasal, bhopal sansadeey kshetra congress ke liye kathin siton main gina jaataa he
 This is because after 1989, that is, for three decades, Congress has not won here
 lihaaja congress kii koshish rajya kii un kathin siton par vishesh dhyaan kendrit karne kii he, jahaan se beete teen yaa usase zyada chunaavon se congress ko lagaataar haar mil rahi he
 The Congress has devised a strategy to face tough seats
 uske sanket bhi ab milane lage hai
 Chief Minister and state president of Congress Kamal Nath announced on Saturday that former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh will contest from Bhopal parliamentary constituency
 mukhyamantri kamalnath ne shanivaar ko patrakaron ke liye yojit ek samaaroh main yahaan kaha, "kendriya chunaav samiti ne tay kar liya he ki digvijay singh bhopal se chunaav ladenge
 i can declare this name
 " saath hi unhone kaha, "digvijay singh ko indore, jabalpur athwa bhopal se chunaav ladane ke liye kaha gaya tha ant main tay hua he ki digvijay singh bhopal se chunaav ladenge
 "it may be known that Kamal Nath had recently said that Digvijay Singh should contest from a tough seat, so the Central Election Committee has also confirmed what Kamal Nath has said
 yah vah sansadeey kshetra he jahaan lambey arase se congress ko jeet nahin mili he
 Kamal Nath was asked whether Digvijay Singh was happy with the decision to contest from Bhopal, then Kamal Nath said, "ask them only, but i am happy
 "digvijay singh ko bhopal se chunaav ladaae jane kaa elaan kiye jane ke baad congress ke bheetar se hi aawaaj uthne lagi he ki rajya kii jabalpur, gwalior, indore, vidisha aadi ve siten hai jahaan se party ko pichley kai chunaav se jeet nahin mili hai
 These also fall in the category of tough seats, will the strong leader be fielded here as well
 bataa den ki digvijay singh ne rajya vidhansabha kaa antim chunaav varsh 2003 main ladaa tha
 After the defeat of the Congress in this election, he declared not to contest any election for 10 years
 uske chalate unhone ab tak koi chunaav nahin ladaa he
 Digvijay Singh is currently a Rajya Sabha member

 That interview was also published through news agencies in those days, but within a month, a state of emergency was declared in the country and it could not be discussed specifically
 baad main jab kabhi charchaa bhi hui to vaajapeyi dwaara maithili bhashaa ko ashtum anusuchee main die gaye samarthan se zyada nahin
 In this interview of Vajpayee, his clear view on subjects such as foreign policy, Kashmir problem, Nepal, internal politics of the country, Soviet connection of Indian communists, America, Russia and China etc
 are revealed
 unheen nitiyon par abhi bhi centre kii bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar chal rahi he or nitiyon main ye nirantarata ascharyajanak he!ek baat jo mahatvapurn he wo ye ki vaajapeyi ne jo kosi mahasethu ke udghaatan ke samay maithili bhashaa ko samvidhan kii ashtum anusuchee main shaamil karne kii ghoshnaa kii usamen maithili abhiyaaniyon sabakaa yogadan to he hi, is saakshaatkaar kaa bhi vishesh yogadan he jisapar vaajapeyi san 1975 main hi apana mantavya spasht kar chuke the
 Maithili should be included in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution without delay: Atal Bihari Vajpayee "maithili language should get an immediate place in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution," this is the statement of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the supreme leader of the Jana Sangh, who gave one to Mithila Mihir Said this in a special interview
 vaajapeyi ji se bhent karne kaa hamalogon kaa pramukh udyeshy maithili bhashaa ke sambandh main unka or unke dal ke drushtikon se parichit hona or use prerit-prabhavit karnaa tha
 In the context of Maithili, during the Sanvid government in 67, Mr
 Vajpayee shouted out as soon as the Jana Sangh supported Maithili as the second official language of Bihar in place of Urdu
 Was Maithili supported by purpose? " After a moment's pause he again spoke - "we supported Maithili on the basis of his ability, his distinguished dignity and the ancient culture of Mithilanchal
 maithili ko diya gaya jansangh kaa samarthan kisi anya bhashaa ke prati irshyaa yaa aakrosh se prabhavit nahin tha
 "similarly, on the question of recognition of Sindhi language, he said-" Maithili is definitely the preserve of superior literature than Sindhi and this language is a medium of expression in a wide area
 jabaki sindhi kisi kshetra vishesh kii adhikarini nahi rahi he
 You people should note that Maithili should get a place in the eighth schedule of the constitution without delay
 ye hamaari maang he, ye hamaare dal kii maang he
 "atal Bihari Vajpayee, a national leader, has earned a reputation not only as the supreme leader of the Jana Sangh but as a well-known national leader
" isi vajah se gat saat may ko dopaher saadhe teen baje se shaam paanch baje tak unka sanidhya hamaare liye avismaraneey ban chukaa he
 He was resting with local advocate Vishnudev Babu due to a headache and immediately after that he was also going to give a speech in a public meeting at Gandhi Maidan
 lekin mithila mihir kaa naam sunate hi ve tatkaal baahar aae or chir-parichit andaaj main hamaara swaagat kiya
 His love for Maithili was not hidden in any way
 mithila mihir kii prati ko haath main lete hue ve tatkaal bol uthe-"vaah! bahut badhiya patrika he
 i am already familiar with its name
 " phir ve bheetar kaa panna ulatney-pulatney lage or sheershak ko padhane kaa prayaas karne lage yatha-'mukhyamantri dow mishra san vishesh bhent-vaarta', 'sutal chhi aa byaah hoit achhi' tathaa 'teen got kavita' (mihir 27 april)
 Then he said with a smile - "I am having trouble understanding Maithili, but i understand something
" " is par jab hamane kaha ki maithili, maithili he
 
 
 So he immediately laughed and said- "where am i saying that Maithili is Hindi?" vastut: maithili to maithili hi he
 "national Question: The intimate atmosphere in which we were interacting with the Supreme Leader of Swarajana Sangh of disagreement was a unique opportunity to get to know their views and views on national questions
" unhone chote-bade sabhi prashnon kaa nishchal muskaan or atmiyata ke sang uttar diya or kuch prashn to aise the jiske jawaab main unhone prashn bhi khadey kiye
 In response to a question that the declared principle of Jana Sangh is to stand up against every kind of chaos and damage to national property from the beginning, then what is the rationale for supporting the current movement, Mr
 Vajpayee said- "you Are right jansangh kabhi bhi kisi aise aandolan kaa samarthan nahin kar saktaa jisase rashtriya sampatti kii kshati athwa araajaktaa failane kii ashanka ho
 i gave a similar warning in Patna at the beginning of the movement last year
 lekin is aandolan ko hamaare dal ke samarthan ke auchity par aaplogon ko ye vichaar karnaa chahie ki hinsa or araajaktaa kaa padurbhaav is aandolan ke kaaran ho rahaa he yaa aandolan ko matiamet karne ke liye sarkaar use badhaava de rahi he? jahaan tak bihar aandolan kaa prashn he to jansangh iske shantipurna charitra or rashtriya udyeshy ke kaaran samarthan kar rahaa he
 "then we asked the leader of the Jana Sangh different kinds of questions related to the internal problems of the country
 prashn: pratipakshi dalon ke bich jab chunaav ladane ke prashn par bhi sahmati nahin he to kya aap aashaa kar rahe hai ki chunaav ke baad sarkaar chalaane ke prashn par ve ek mat ho paaenge?uttar:(hansi) ekta ke abhaav main sarkaar kisi! sarkaar ke gathan ke liye sattarudh dal ko parajeet karnaa hoga or uske liye pehle ekta chahie
 In principle i do not disagree with you at all, but as far as the defeat of the Congress and the unity of the opposition parties is concerned, remember that the unity of the political parties and the origin of the conflict are due to historical circumstances
 prashn: kya aagaamee chunaav main aapkaa dal marxvaadi communist party ke saath chunavi samjhauta kar saktaa he?uttar: marxbaadi party ke saath jansangh kaa chunaav samjhaute kaa koi prashn hi nahin uthta
 Question: If the 'left Democratic Front' of the Socialist Party and the Marxbadi Party etc
 becomes active again, will the Jana Sangh break even with the Socialist Party in such a situation? Answer: No
 socialist party se hamaara chunavi samjhauta kisi bhi sthiti main ho saktaa he
 By the way, we would suggest him to move away from CPM
 prashn: raajnneetik dalon kii sankhya main atyadhik badhottaree ke sambandh main aapkaa kya vichaar he? vartmaan vyavastha main kin-kin dalon kaa auchity ho saktaa he?uttar :auchity ke bare main to main nahin kahuunga lekin itnaa nishchit he ki raajnneetik dalon kii sankhya main kami honi chahie
 The current movement will definitely have an impact on the increase in the number of political parties
 prashn: kya nirdaleey janatantr or 'janata' ummidavaar kii avadharana main kisi tarah kaa samya he?uttar :'janata' ummidavaar kii avadharana vastut: nirdaleey parivesh se adhik sarvadaleey sahmati ko prakat karti he or raajnneetik dalon ke satta-lobh ko janata kii ganga-yamuna main visarjeet karne kaa praytn karata he
 Whereas the concept of 'independent democracy' is a political philosophy introduced by Shri Jayaprakash Narayan to keep the Constitution and democracy free from interference, intimidation and pressure
 lekin is nirdaleey janatantr kii sthapana karne ke liye bhi ek majboot raajnneetik dal kii aavashyaktaa he
 (saying that Vajpayee laughed, he clearly meant that the Jana Sangh is the only political party in this movement that has the ability to establish Jayaprakashji's independent democracy!) Question: The ruling party is accused of undemocratic conduct
 Is it, while the opposition still has every kind of facility to say its answer? Answer: In a democracy, the kind of conduct of the ruling party with political parties is Neither should he not be as any today
 aaj desh main raajnneetik hatyaon kii baadh aa gai he, bhinn-bhinn bahaanon se jail main raajnneetik bandiyon ko goli se udaaya ja rahaa he
 One hundred and forty-four are put on display and procession
 akashwani par shri jaiprakashji ke bhaashan ko puri tarah se blike out kar diya jaataa he
 In this way, how many evidences of the anti-democracy conduct of the government should be counted? Question: What is your analysis towards the current leadership of Congress? Answer: The present leadership of Congress is going on the path of totalitarianism
 pandit jawaharlal nehru sansad ke prati sarvaadhik jaagruk rahete the, jabaki shrimati gandhi sansad ke prati upekshapurna drushtikon rakhti hai
 They are highly intolerant towards opposing parties
 saath hi, vartmaan netritv communist party kaa pakshdhar bhi he or is tathy ko wo soviet-bharat maitri se dhankane kii kucheshtaa karata he
 Whereas the fact is that both the Soviet Friendship and the Communist Party of India share different things
 congress ke vibhaajan ke samay communiston ke sang unki mitrataa kaa rahasy to samaj main aata tha, lekin aaj ke din is gathbandhan kaa kya auchity he ye samaj nahin aata!iske alaava, vartmaan netritv ek aise raajnneetik dal ke kriyakalapon ko pratibimbit kar rahaa he jo do number ke paise par pal rahaa he or bhitari va bahari charitrik sankat kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 Everyone within the party is calling each other thieves
 prashn: kya aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main 'janata ummidavaaron' kii vijay ke baad aap samvidhan sabha ke punargathan kii sambhaavna dekh rahe hai?uttar :kisi bhi kaary ke peeche uske auchity par vichaar karnaa hoga
 In my view, what has been wrong in implementing the constitution in the last twenty-six years should be investigated
 satta kaa vikendrikaran, centre-rajya sambandh, rajya kii aarthik kshamta or uskaa strot, naagarik ke mul adhikaar ityadi samasyaon ko drushti main rakhte hue samvidhan par ek ayog kaa gathan avashya hona chahie
 Only after the recommendation of that commission can the demand for restructuring of the Constituent Assembly be raised
 prashn: loksabhaa or vidhansabhaon se pratinidhiyon ko waapas bulaane ke mudde par aapaki kya raay he?uttar :siddhantat: main isse sahamat hum
 But through which institution, under which circumstances and under which procedures this civil right should be exercised - these are serious matters to be considered
 vaise haare hue lagbhag sabhi ummidavaar matdaan ke tatkaal baad hi hastakshar abhiyaan shuru kar denge or phir vijeta vyakti ke liye mushkil ho jaaegi
 Yes, representatives like Tulmohan Ram must be recalled under any circumstances
 (hansi) (tulamohan ram bihar se hi ek saansad the or un par license scandle ke naam se bhrashtachar kaa mukadmaa chal rahaa tha)prashn: kalakatta main jaiprakashji par lathi se prahaar or morarji bhaai ke anshan par pratipaksh kii taraf se anukool pratikriya vyakt kar kya shri shaikh abdulla phir se nai bhoomika kaa sanket de rahe hai?uttar :shaikh abdulla jivan kaa vyapak anubhav praapt kar chuke hai or satta se sangharsh kii sthiti main rahe hai
 Today they are again with the main national stream, which has two distinct sides of the ruling party and the opposition
 apane vichaar ke aadhaar par ve kisi bhi paksh ke saath khadey ho sakate hai
 However, his recent statement introduces his strong character more than his new role
 prashn: bangladesh ke abhyuday ke baad dilli main aapaki shri shaikh abdulla se gupt vaarta hui thi
 Has there been any significant change in his approach since then? Answer: At the time when i had my first talks with Sheikh, his attitude would be to keep peace with Pakistan and resolve the dispute even if Pakistan-occupied Kashmir gives it to Pakistan
 Was in favor of giving it
 saath hi ve chaahate the ki bharat kaa abhinn ang rahete hue bhi kashmir kaa darwaja pakistani paryatakon ke liye khol diya janaa chahie
 Sheikh also thought that the srinagar-rawalpindi road should be kept operational as the srinagar-jammu road gets blocked at the time of snowfall and Kashmir has to suffer a trade deficit
 kabhi-kabhi to srinagar main namak tak milanaa dubhar ho jaataa he
 But as far as the present question is concerned, if the Government of India tries to capture Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Shaikh will surely be helpful in it
 sahmati ke kshetrasath hi kuch aise bhi kshetra hai jahaan vartmaan vyavastha or uske drushtikon se shri vaajapeyi praaia: sahamat jaise dikhe
 That area is the foreign policy of the Government of India
 vaise kuch hi din purv chini dootvaas par congressi saansad shashibhushan ke netritv main hue pradarshan par teevr pratikriya vyakt karte hue ve bole- "chini duutavas par congressi saansad shashibhushan dwaara pradarshan ke netritv kaa kya arth he? aakhir isamen kya rahasy ho saktaa he ki itane dinon ke baad congressiyon ko tibet kii swatantraaa kaa samaran aayaa he? jab mainen, jaiprakashji, dow lohia or kriplaniji ne tibet kaa prashn uthaaya tha to hamen pratikriyaavaadi kaha gaya, phir aaj in "pragatisheel" logon ke man main tibet ke prati sahanubhuti kyon jag uthi he? kya kahin soviet sangh ke ishaare par bharat sarkaar china ke saath do-do haath karne kii taiyaari to nahin kar rahi he?prashn: kya aap bharat sarkaar kii nepal niti se sahamat hai?uttar :sahmati-asahmati kii koi vishesh baat nahin he
 The basic thing is that Nepal is a neighboring country of a big country, on which on the other side there is a huge nation
 aisi sthiti main nepal kaa shankaalu or chatur ho janaa swabhaavik he
 But it is certain that the people of Nepal and India will not let these two countries go against each other under any circumstances
 prashn: america abhi bhi khud ko vishwa main loktantr kaa rakshak samaj rahaa he
 What is your view in this regard? Answer: There is definitely democracy in America but totalitarianism is outside
 main loktantr ke naam par america ke sainik adda or upniveshvaadi niti kaa ghor virdohi hum
 Question: What is your analysis of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union? Answer: i am a fan of friendship and active cooperation with the Soviet Union
 lekin ab america-rus ke alaava china ke ek vaishvik shakti main udai se soviet sangh kii niti main kramik parivartan aa rahaa he or wo america ke saath milakar kramash: puure sansar ko apane prabhaav main baantne kii nai taiyaari kar rahaa he
 Such a disguised consent policy has been born in relation to Middle East Asia and India
 iskaa parinaam yah hoga ki vikasshil desh bhi apni nai bhoomika kaa nirdhaaran karenge
 Question: What is your reaction to the end of the Vietnam War? Is integration of both Vietnam possible immediately? Answer: Nationalist elements have won in the Vietnam War
 vaise ye baat nishchit he ki is rashtriya sangharsh main communist tatv kaa mahatvapurn yogadan tha
 Yet the people of Vietnam did not invite any foreign army to land on their land for help
 jahaan tak ekikaran kaa prashn he, us sambandh main kisi tarah kii bhavishyavaanee nahin kii ja sakati he
 By the way, i would like to help solve most of Vietnam's internal problems if the government is formed through elections
 gati main kavyashri vaajapeyi se, jo jivan ke prarambh main kavi rahe the, isiliye unase yah poochna swabhaavik tha ki ab unhone kavita likhnaa kyon chhod diya he
 In response to this question, Vajpayeeji said- "yes, earlier i used to write poetry, but now i have given up
 ab to meri gati main hi kavy he!" kuch kshan maun rahane ke baad ve phir bole-"sakriy raajnneeti or kavita main bada virodh he
 Poetry requires time and concentration that i cannot find
 "unke is jawaab par hamaare mitra or prabhavi maithili sahityakar shri markandeya pravasi ne tatkaal prashn kiya- "is baat par agar kavi-gana aapkaa gheraav karen to?""main unalogon ko kavita sunaane lagunga," vaajapeyiji kaa jawaab tha
 Regarding the new poem, Mr
 Vajpayee said- "I read the new poem and i like it
" nai kavita main yug kii samasya or usase bhi adhik uski vibheeshikaa kii jhalak milti he
 "vajpayee ji is unmarried, so one's curiosity in this regard is natural
 jab hamane unase ye poocha ki kya desh seva ke liye paariwarik daayitv se mukt rahane kii sthiti zyada adarshamulak he, to vaajapeyi thodaa gambhir hokar bole- "desh-seva ke liye paariwarik daayitv se mukt rahanaa ek suvidhajanak sthiti ho sakati he, kyonki isse kaary karne ke liye adhik samay miltaa he or vyakti ko saamanyat: swaarth se alag rahane kaa avasar praapt ho jaataa he
 But the best from us (ie unmarried leaders) are those who serve the country and the party even while carrying out family responsibilities
 "ant main chalate samay shri vaajapeyi apni shishtataa or vinod-mishrit athmiya swar main ye kahe bina nahin rah sake-"dekhiegaa bhagwan! meri uktiyon main namak-mirch nahin lagaaiyegaa, jaisaa jo kaha he vaise hi chhap dijiega
 Saying this, he again laughed free
 noteemul maithili main prakashit is saakshaatkaar kasushant jhane hindi main anuwaad kiya he or viranchi ji ne ise prakashit karne kii hamen vishesh anumati di he
 (translation: Sushant Jha, Sushant is Senior Copy Editor at India Today Group) aaj deshbhar main sawan kaa teesraa somvaar manaaya ja rahaa he
 According to Hindu Panchag, today is the festival of Nag Panchami
 naag panchami kaa tyohaar shravan maas ke shukla paksh kii panchami ko manaaya jaataa he
 On this day, the law of worshiping the serpent god is told
 somvaar ke saath nagpanchami padane se is din kaa mahatv or bad gaya he
 According to astrologers, this rare coincidence is being made after about 125 years
 aaie jaanate hai aaj bhagwaan shiv or naag devtaa kii krupa paane ke liye kis shubh muhoort main naag devtaa kii puja kerani chahie
 According to Nag Panchami muhurta-hindu Panchag, Panchami Tithi will start from 6
48 pm on Sunday, August 4, and will continue till 3
55 pm on Monday
 somvaar ke udai tithi main panchami hone se puure din panchami tithi bani rahegi
 If you talk about the best time for worshiping Nag Panchami, then it will be from 7
30 pm to 3
55 pm
 naag panchami vrath va pujan vidhi--is vrath ke dev aath naag maane gaye hai
 On this day, Ashtanagas named Ananta, Vasuki, Padma, Mahapadma, Takshak, Kular, Karkat and Shankha are worshiped
 - subah ghar kii safai karne ke baad nahaakar saaf kapade pahanen
 - After this, install a picture, statue or figure of Nag Dev
 - phir dahi, durva, kusha, gandh, akshat, pushp, jal, kachche doodh, roli or chaaval se naag dev kaa pujan karen
 Offer sweetmeat to them and place milk and milk in the bowl instead of their place of residence
 - iske baad aarti karke nagpanchami kii katha sunen
 On the day of Nagpanchami, Kailashnath Shiva receives special blessings with the serpents, but it is very important to keep some special things in mind while worshiping them on this day, otherwise Nagdev can also be angry
 nagpanchami par pujan ke dauraan baraten ye saavdhaaniyaan-agar aap naag panchami par naag devtaa kii krupa paanaa chaahate hai to aapako ye saavdhaaniyaan jarur baratani chahie
 - Never worship snakes without worshiping Shiva
 - naagon kii swatantra puja na karen, unki puja shiv ji ke aabhushan ke rup main hi karen
 On the day of Nagpanchami, neither dig the land nor cut the greens

 bijepi ke netritv vaali emsidi ke bhrashtachar ne dilli waalon ko sabase zyada pareshaan kar rakhaa he
 No work is complete without a bribe
 iske alaava unhone jis party kaa daaman thama he, vah bhi koi eemaandaaree kii ganga nahin he
 Modi was talking big about corruption before coming to power, but now he is silent
 kahin bedi kaa haal bhi aisa hi na ho
 i will vote for Ajay Maken, because

 Will Bedi's BJP come under the purview of RTI? Big parties like BJP and Congress do not want to bring themselves under the purview of RTI
 kiran bedi to shuru se partiyon ko artiai ke andar laane kii himachati rahi hai, to kya bijepi badal jaaegi
 This does not seem to be happening
 bijepi ne jis tarah se loksabhaa chunaav main pani kii tarah paisa bahaya, kya in chunaavon main bhi aisa hi hoga
 And whose money is this? Is there any black money? Will Kiran Bedi tell anything about this? main arvind kejariwal ko vot duungaa, kyonki
 
 
 3
 bahes se kyon bhaag rahi hai?arvind kejariwal ne bahes kii chunauti di or congress ke ajay maakan maan gaye, par kiran bedi ko aitraaj he
 Why is Bedi running away from the debate? dilli waalon ko puraa haq he ki vot daalane se pehle wo apane netaaon ke vichaar or nitiyon ko jaane
 Where his party stands on an issue, it should be public and it is possible through debates also, but Bedi ji is avoiding it
 chaunkaane vaali baat to yah he ki kiran bedi baar-baar samvaad par jor detii hai
 i will vote for Kiran Bedi, because

 Communal policies and the news of communal programs such as provocative speeches and homecoming after the Modi government came to power disappointed the most
 aisa lagane laga he ki bijepi sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas ke agenda se bhatak gai he
 The riots in Trilokpuri and the attacks in the church of Dilshan Gardens are intimidating
 in vivaadit muddon par kiran bedi kya sochati hai? abhi tak unhone alpsankhyakon ko bharosa nahin dilaayaa he
 5
 dilli paise kaise kamayegi?mujhe sabase zyada niraashaa is baat se he ki ab tak dilli ke sabhi netaaon ne muft baantne kii baat kii he, par dilli kamayegi kaise? is par kisi ne kuch bhi nahin kaha
 Businesses are increasing day by day in Delhi, but there is disappointment among businessmen in the government
 or dilli kii kamai inhen vyapaariyon par nirbhar he
 But Bedi ji's policies are also secondary on this issue
 main ajay maakan ko vot nahin duungaa, kyonki
 
 
 6
 dilli kii suraksha kii javabdehidelli kii suraksha kii javabdehi kiski hogi? 16 disambar ke haadase ke baad har dilliwaala isi sawaal se jujhataa rahaa ki aakhir is badi chook ke liye kise javabdeh mana jaae
 To the Chief Minister or the Delhi Police who are not under him
 kiran bedi baar-baar saajhedaari main kaam karne kii baat karti hai, par yah ek tarah se ahm muddon se jimmedaari se bhaagane kaa tarika nahin he
 7
 dilli ko purna rajya kaa darjadilli ko purna rajya kaa darja kab milegaa? in vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad yaa phir 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke
 The BJP responds to this issue, and Kiran Bedi has not spoken anything contrary to her image
 jab centre main unki hi sarkaar he to siem ummidavaar itnaa bharosa to dilaa hi sakati hai
 i will not vote for Arvind Kejriwal, because
 
 
 8
 Kiran Bedi has often been accused of dictatorial attitude during her timid career
 kahin aisa mukhyamantri banane ke baad to nahin hoga
 One is the parachute candidate, for whom many BJP leaders are angry
 agar siem banane par kiran bedi apni hi party ke netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko saath lekar nahin chalengi to dilli kaa bedaa gark hona tay he
 9
 aapkaa dil baar-baar kyon badalata hapehle bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolan, phir raajnneeti se parhez or phir achaanak hi raajnneeti main aane ko raji
 First the rhetoric against Modi and BJP on a public platform, and now the CM candidate of the same party
 kiran bedi ji baar-baar aapke vichaar kyon badal jate hai?10
 Kejriwal had also offered CM, why the BJP is the most important question is that Arvind Kejriwal also offered you the CM post
 or un dinon kejariwal se aapke rishte itane bhi kharaab nahin the
 But you chose BJP, the answer is not yet received

 Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell has said that in order to deal with Indian captain Virat Kohli in the upcoming four-test series, guests will have to raise doubts about their technique
 kohli is samay shandaar form main hai chal rahe hai
 He recently scored a double century in the only Test against Bangladesh
 isi ke saath vah chaar test siries main lagaataar chaar dohare shatak lagane vaale duniya ke pehle ballebaaj ban gaye hai
 The team is also doing well under Kohli's captaincy and has been invincible in 19 consecutive Test matches
 australia ke khilaaf siries kaa pehla test 23 farvari se shuru hoga
 Maxwell believes that Kohli is doing well at the moment and according to him, running out of Kohli or getting out in any unfortunate way will create a situation of doubt in his mind and it will help the Australian team to deal with him
 
 cricket dot com dot eyu ne maxwell ke hawaale se likhaa he, "main nahin maanata ki yah kisi takanic yaa aisi hi koi or baat he
 i believe that he is in excellent form at the moment
 " tippaniyan He said, "players are in such form when everything is easy for them
 or, yahi kohli ke saath ho rahaa he
 "maxwell said," If he gets out unfortunate or runs out, it can create doubt in his mind
 " unhone kaha, "ummid he ki ham shuruaati test maichon main unke dimag main shaq paidaa kar saken or unhen unki takanic ke bare main sochane par vivash kar saken
 "regarding Kohli's continuity, Maxwell said," We have been watching his game for the last few months
 jis tarah se vah khel rahe hai, uski keval prashansa kii ja sakati he
 " unhone kaha, "vah nirantarata ke saath khel rahe hai or shatak bana rahe hai jaisaa ki vah apane shuruaati kariyar main adhik nahin kar paa rahe the
 But, now he is scoring double century and winning the match for the country

 " turki ke sainya mukhyalay ankara main shuukravaar ko bandhak banaae gaye logon main turki ke chif of military staff bhi shaamil hai
 This information was given by the government news agency Anadolu, while according to CNN Turk, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is safe

 Turkish military forces said on Friday that they had taken power to maintain the democratic system in the country and to preserve human rights
 bihar vidhaan sabha main vipaksh ke netaa tejasvi yadav kahaan hai ye ek rahasy banataa ja rahaa he
 Along with this, a big question is also arising whether Tejashwi does not want to stay in Patna
 rashtriya janata dal ke varisht netaaon jaise raghuvansh prasad singh or shivanand tiwari ne tejasvi ke patna se baahar rahane par chintaa zaahir kii he aapako bataa den kitejasvi kareeb ek maheene se patna se baahar hai
 In the meantime, if he is at his home or in Muzaffarpur, the death of children has kept himself away
 argedy sutron kii maane to party ke rashtriya adhyaksh lalu yadav ne phone kar unhen patna waapas jane kii salaah di he
 But so far it does not seem to have any effect
 sabase zyaada tanaav main party ke vidhayak nazar aa rahe hai
 He says that the party is as frustrated and disappointed as Tejashwi's stance after the results of the Lok Sabha elections did not happen even after losing the 2010 assembly elections
 party ke varisht netaa bhi maanate hai ki agar yahi halaat rahe to aane vaale kuch samay main vidhayak apane kshetra ke sameekaran ke anusaar yah janata dal united (jediu) yaa bijepi main jane kii prakriya shuru kar denge lekin uske pehle tejasvi yadav kii kaaryastylee ke bare main ungali uthaanaa nahin bolenge
 On the other hand, some close confidants of Lalu Yadav of the party say that the behavior of Tejashwi till date is definitely beyond comprehension
 lekin shaayad ek loksabhaa or do vidhansabha kaa up chunaav jeetne ke baad shaayad unhen galatafahami ho gai thi ki unke paas itane paryaapt voten hai ki mukhyamantri banane kii sapana puraa karne ke liye unhen saath kisi kii zarurat nahin he
 But the truth is that most of the mlas believe that no one can win them on RJD ticket and under the leadership of Tejashwi Yadav
 lekin ek baar phir agar nitish kumaar kaa saath ho jaae to unhen koi haraa bhi nahin saktaa
 Allies are also upset with Tejashwi Yadav's attitude
 jaise congress party ke netaa hon yaa jithan ram maanjhi yaa mukesh nishad
 In all public and private conversations, now considering him as the Chief Ministerial candidate, they are rethinking their future politics with him

 Adarsh bahubna will be taught in this course
 ye course teen maheene kaa hoga or iske liye philhal 30 siten tay kii gai hai
 When Aaj Tak asked Professor DC Gupta, Vice Chancellor of Barkatullah University, why the need was felt for this course, he told that this decision has been taken to stop the quarrel of the mother-in-law
 unhone kaha, '' shaadi se pehle ek ladki apni maa ke ghar rahati he lekin shaadi baad duusare ghar jaati he
 Many times in the in-laws, due to trivial matters, even the dispute arises
 aise main ise rokane yaa kam karne ke makasad se yah course shuru kiya ja rahaa he
 "this is the course's concept professor DC Gupta also told about the concept of this course
 unhone kaha, ''saas- bahu ho yaa betaa-beti ho sabhi parivaar kaa ang hote hai
 In all this, family is getting disintegrated due to bad blood
 is vajah se parivaar ke sadasyon main tanaav bhi bad rahaa he
 This course will help in reducing it
 " professor gupta ke mutabik is course main ladakiyon ko sikhaaya jayega ki shaadi ke baad nae ghar main edjust kaise karen
 Apart from this, we will also be taught about becoming a bride that connects the family
 "purush bhi le sakenge daakhilauniwarsity ke vaais chancelar professor disi gupta ne bataaya ki is course main yuvatiyaan yaa shaadishuda mahilaayein admician le sakengi
 According to Professor Gupta, if a man also wants to enroll in this course, then he will be able to take it so that he too can learn to adjust according to his in-laws or his family with the help of this course
 yadi samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party kaa gathbandhan ban gaya to mayawati apane puraane kshetra bijanour ke nagina surakshit seat yaa phir ambedkarnagar se loksabhaa chunaav lard sakati hai
 However, sources say that it all depends on the formation of an alliance between the two parties
 gauratlab he ki 1989 main mayawati ne bijanour se chunaav ladaa tha or vahaan se chunakar sansad pahunchi thim
 Mayawati won this seat due to the dalit-muslim alliance and this seat is traditionally considered as BSP
 isi tarah vah ambedkarnagar se bhi dalit-muslim ekta kii badaulat chunaav jeet chuki hai
 Mayawati will add enthusiasm to supporters! There is an atmosphere of frustration among party supporters due to the crushing defeat of BSP in assembly elections 2012 and Lok Sabha elections 2014
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is baar mayawati apane samarthakon kaa utsaah badhaane ke liye khud bhi chunavi maidan main utar sakati hai
 Let me tell you that she was a Lok Sabha MP in 1998, 1999 and 2004
 vah rajyasabha saansad bhi rah chuki hai, lekin pichley saal unhone istipha de diya tha
 However, the Congress has advocated contesting the Grand Alliance elections under the leadership of Mayawati
 congress ke bade netaa or purv rajyapal ajij kuraishi ne lakhanu main buudhvaar ko yojit press conference main kaha ki agar rahul gandhi ke naam par sahmati nahin ban paati to mayawati ke netritv main mahagathbandhan ko 2019 kaa chunaav ladanaa chahie, or agar teenon dal ek saath ek manch par aa gaye to modi ko hataane kaa rasta saaf ho jayega
 The message of solidarity, although no form has been formally discussed Mayawati contesting from the BSP, but after the results of the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections, there is a full possibility of alliance between the SP-BSP, because the politics of U
P
 Both the parties which have a big impact in India, realize that the solidarity of the mayawati-akhilesh has sent a positive message to the public

 enie ne castady badhaane kii arji lagate hue court ko bataaya ki hawala ke puure nexs ko todane ke liye abhi kaiyon se is maamle main poochtacha kerani he
 Let us tell you that on Thursday itself, the Patiala House Court has given 6 days' Kashmiri separatist leader Shabbir Shahki's custody to the ED
 idi ne court se kaha ki shabbir shah par gambhir aarope he or ham apni jaanch kar rahe hai
 Therefore, Shabbir Shah's custody should be extended for 7 days, as the investigation on the money trail is at a very delicate point
 mumkin he ki is maamle menenaiebhi shabbir shah se teror funding ko lekar poochtacha karne ke liye idi se castady le sakati he

 In order to defame Google's security, whatsapp's fake app was available on the Play Store and has been downloaded by 10 lakh people
 reports ke mutabik google play store par Update whatsapp naam kaa ap kaaphi dinon tak rahaa jise log lagaataar downlod karte rahe
 The most dangerous and serious is that this app was from the same developer nan from which the real whatsapp app is on the Google Play Store

 gauratlab he ki whatsap ap play store par whatsapp Inc develpar nem se uplabdh he
 Generally, to identify a fake app, people read the name of the developer to find out which publisher the app belongs to and which developer is the right one
 whatsapp kaa farji ap google play store par whatsapp Inc develpar nem se hi maujuud tha
 In such a situation, there was no other option for the people to get it right or wrong and probably for this reason 10 lakh people have also downloaded it

 isse pehle bhi google play store par kai aise khatarnaak or farji ap aate hai jisase yujar ko bada nuksaan bhi hota he
 How is it possible that someone can put an app on whatsapp Inc developer name on Google Play Store? This question will also be in your mind
 ise dekh kar aisa lagata he jaise havers ne develpar nem kii jagahathhatsapp Inc dikhaane ke liye kisitrix kaa yuj kiya he
 These tricks can be Unicode
 aisa pehle bhi dekhne ko mila he jab aipal kii website kisi unicode ke jariye khol kar logon ko bevakoof banaaya gaya

 redit yujar ne is ap kii ditels kaa screenshot bhi share kiya he jisamen whatsapp+inc%c3%a0 likhaa he, lekin play store par sirf whatsapp Inc dikhaa or duusare code invizible hai
 Since whatsapp is used by one billion people all over the world, the fake app of this name is quite serious
 isliye ise google kii security chook kaha ja saktaa he
 Google has recently launched Google Play Protect which will identify such apps on the Google Play Store which are fake
 itnaa hi nahin company daawa karti ai he ki lagaataar lakhon eps ko scan kiya jaataa he taaki koi bhi khatarnaak ap google play store main na aa saken
 But still an app was available with the same developer name as whatsapp and people downloaded it
 This is a very serious matter and Google should focus on it
 kyonki farji whatsap install karke aapke smartphone se samvedansheel data chori se lekar phone hack hone jaisi dikkatein saamne aa sakati hai

 To understand these reasons, one has to know about those Chanakyas of Anna who do not manage the media but only understand the media and the media goes on managing itself
 samarthakon ke naam anna kaa sandesh, samarthan se mil rahi he urjabhrashtachar ke khilaaf desh bhar main alakh jagaane vaale anna ko dilli police giraftaar kar chuki thi
 On one hand, Anna's supporters were opposing the police protesting against the arrest, on the other hand, Anna's message was being telecast on all the news channels
 har koi hairaan har tha
 Anna was in police custody
 phir wo desh ko sambodhit kaise kar sakate hai
 The government lost its senses when Anna's movement was crushed

 Team Anna is several steps ahead of the government, not only in media management but also in the use of technology for movement
 andolan ke bare main pal pal kii jaankaree dene ke liye anna kii team ne ek kol centre banaaya
 Created a website called India Angst Corruption which is updated every moment

 Not only this, Team Anna also used reality shows to convey his message to the people
 saaf he ki anna kii team media management se lekar soochnaaon ke prachaar or janamat banane main har maamle main sarkaar par bees sabit hui he
 Emperor Chandragupta Maurya was made king by a Chanakya destroying the Nanda dynasty

 This system will be applied to the Mumbai and Guwahati Rajdhani trains experimentally
 railway trainon ke injanon main isro main viksit integrated circuit (isi) chip lagayegaa
 With this, Hooter will warn the people using the road when the train approaches an unmanned gate
 is pariyojna se jude rail mantralay ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki guwahati or mumbai ke liye rajdhani ke rail margo par 20 maanav rahit rail phatakon par hooter lagaae jaaenge
 According to the project, more trains will be equipped with this technology in a phased manner
 iske tahat phatakon se kareeb 500 meter pehle isi chip ke madhyam se hooter sakriy ho jayega
 This will alert the people using the roadways as well as the train driver near the gate
 jaise-jaise train rail phatak ke najadik pahonchegi, hooter kii aawaaj tej hoti jaaegi
 Hooters will calm down as soon as the train crosses
 sadak maarg upyog karne waalon ko sachet karne ke saath hi upgrah aadhaarit pranali kaa upyog train par nigaah rakhane or real-time ke aadhaar par uske avaagaman ke bare main bataane ke liye bhi hoga

 As the train approaches the rail gate, the sound of the hooter will become louder
 train ke paar hote hi hooter shant ho jayega
 Along with alerting the road users, the satellite based system will also be used to monitor the train and tell about its movement on a real-time basis

 Saint Rampal, who came in the eyes of the people in defiance of the court, was not arrested till then, people did not even believe that the list of secrets and misdeeds behind this man would be so long
 lekin ab rampal ke shikanje main aate hi jahaan uskaa tilism taar-taar hone laga he, vahiin ek-ek kar uske raaj bhi beparda hone lage hai
 Raj is also such that whoever listens, just keep listening
 rampal ke ashram se police ko kai aisi chizon mili hai, jinke bare main logon ko pehle thodaa bhi andeshaa nahin tha
 Police have also recovered a pregnancy test kit from Rampal's room
 dharm kaa paakhand ab salaakhon ke peeche pighalane laga he
 Becoming a self-proclaimed saint was too much for this flag bearer of Kabirpanth
 haathon se salakhen pakadebaba apane ateet kaa ek ek panna palat rahaa he
 Baba's pride boasting of wealth from crimes has started melting like burning iron
 ab rampal ke aise aise khulaase ho rahe hai ki sunakar hi kaan khadey ho rahe hai
 The police now want to bring out the truth of the corner of the ashram, taking Rampal along
 or iske liye baqayada police kii chah alag alag timen baniin
 Today we are going to reveal Baba's 10 deep secrets in which Baba is hidden
 1
 Baba's gaze on the ladies' bathroom! Although Baba's ashram is inside and outside, countless CCTV cameras are installed
 lekin raaj kii baat ye he ki mahila shauchalayon par bhi baba ne sitivi camere laga rakhe the
 It is being told that the screens of these cctvs ranged from Rampal's very special rest room to places where no one except Baba was allowed to go
 vaise to baba ke ashram main 854 bathroom, 1254 toilet banaae gaye hai
 But according to sources Baba's cameras used to stare at the women's bathroom more
 police lagaataar, isaki chaanbin kar rahi he or baba ko beparda kar rahi he
 2
 doodh kaa snaan or kheer kaa prasad!baba rampal kii giraftaar ke baad jo doosraa raaj saamne aayaa he wo ye ki baba doodh se nahaata tha, or phir usee doodh kii kheer banaakar bhakton cobaantata tha
 Rampal used to sit in a meditative posture on high posture, bathe the devotee Baba and then the same milk would be collected in the vessel
 phirababa isi doodh kii kheer banavaakar, bhakton main baantta
 It is said that milk was spilled on Rampal from the pipe on the roof of the room
 phir usee doodh ko tub vagairah main ikattha kiya jaataa tha
 The milk pudding made from Baba's body was made
 baba kahata tha ki jo is kheer ko khayega, uske saath chamatkaar hoga
 Baba Rampal did not only do this in the Satlok Ashram, but he also bathed in Rohtak's ashram with milk
 4 acre main bane puraane ashram main babane 20 gaay paal rakhi thim or un gaayon ke doodh se baba snaan karata tha
 3
 baba kii ayyashi kaa bedroom!12 acre zamin par bana baba kaa rahasy lok or us rahasyalok main baba kaa 5 manjila kila
 Baba's luxury bedroom in this fort which had facilities like Five Star Hotel
 lekin bedroom ke gadde kaa sukh bababhog chukaa he
 The bathroom in Baba's bedroom is also completely foreign
 baba isi bedroom se apane blike commandon ko hukum detaa tha to gupt lift bhi baba ke bedroom main hi khulti he
 Ayyasha's entire belongings were present in Baba's bedroom
 4
 Baba's bulletproof Singhasanrampal used to sit on a 12-foot-high bullet-proof throne
 is singhasananuma kursi par baithkar rapamaal bhakton ko pravachan detaa tha
 Another feature of this bulletproof cabin of Baba is that it has a hydraulic lift through which Baba reached the direct cabin
 chaaron taraf camere lage hai
 That is, Baba used to keep an eye on all along with the discourse
 5
 Whether the Rajbat of Rampal's basement belongs to the Karuntha Ashram of Rampal or the police of the Satlok Ashram of Barwala, there is definitely a secret cellar in his ashrams
 jahaan rampal duniyaavaalon kii nigahon se chhip kar rahasyamayi gatividhiyon ko anjaam diya karata he
 The rule of Rampal's cellars first came to light in 2006 when Aryasamaj's followers clashed with his devotees in this ashram
 police rampal ke ashram main daakhil hui to tamaam aisho aaraam ke saamaanon ke saath-saath ashram main chhipe tahkhaane ko dekh kar uski ankhen bhi fatty kii fatty rah gai
 According to the police, this basement in the ashram was built in such a way that it always disappeared from the eyes of all the people
 takreeban 100 meter lambey is tahkhaane se rampal kai baar bhakton ke bich main kuch aise prakat hota tha ki log use mayavi samaj lete the
 But when the police searched the ashram, this secret came to the fore
 hisar police ko rampal ke barwaala ashram main bhi tahkhaana hone kii khabar mili he
 Perhaps this is the reason why the DGP of the state is saying to take at least two days to research the ashram to remove the curtain from all these rajas
 6
 The 'avatar' of Nostradamus is shocking and every secret of Rampal
 kya aap yakeen karenge ki rampal khud ko 445 saal baad prakat honevaala wo hindu sant qaraar detaa he, jiskaa zikr san 1555 main prasiddh bhavishyavaktaa nastredamas ne kiya tha
 In fact, during his prophecy Nostredamus had said that some 445 years from now, a Hindu saint will appear who will establish India as the world guru and Rampal, who came to Uruz since 2006, himself Saints started throwing dust in people's eyes
 rampal ke ashramon ke kai kitabon main in baton kaa zikr tha
 According to these literature, according to the prediction of Nostradamus, by the end of the fifth century, in the year 1999, a saint will leave the world and become a saint and his revolution will run till 2006
 iske baad log uskaa anusharan karne lagenge or tab swarna yug kii shuruyaat hogi
 7
 bhakt, baba or maaya jalmulti level marketing kaa jaal bana bichhaakar aapane kai companiyon ko farsh se arsh tak kaa safar puraa karte dekha hoga
 According to the police, Rampal had kept a similar tactic to spread his boast
 wo apane har bhakt se do bhakton ko jodne ke liye kahata or unhen naam diksha dene ke naam par ashram main roak kar unka brinwash kiya karata tha
 Rampal's MLM trap proved to be so effective that it can be gauged from this that thousands of people had looted crores of rupees on Rampal by believing these things of Rampal, claiming to be God and showing him the way to salvation
 8 rampal kii tijori rajbarwala ke bill se rampal ko khinch nikaalane ke baad jab haryana police satalok ashram main daakhil hui to rampal kaa ek or raaj unka intazaar kar rahaa tha
 Of the vault of Raj Rampal
 
 
 darasal, is ashram main rampal ne jagah-jagah naa sirf kai taalon main band shelf or dryer bana rakhe the, balki kuch khaas thikaanon par electranik tijoriyaan bhi maujuud thim
 The safes that are commonly used to hold prized items such as cash and jewelery
 lekin jate-jate rampal or uske samarthak naa sirf in tijoriyon ko khufia code numberon se lock kar gaye, balki police kaa kaam mushkil karne ke liye kuch hi batariyaan bhi nikaal gaye
 The question arises that where and how did Rampal, who describes himself as following the footsteps of Saint Kabir of Fakiri, add so much wealth
 jise use tijoriyon main kaid karke rakhana padataa tha
 In such a situation, it is now another challenge for the police to open these chests and reach the real secret hidden inside it
 9 baba ke karmon kii hard discrampal ke karatuuton kii paraten ughaad rahi police ko har rose nai chizein haath lag rahi hai
 The police have turned their eyes on what they have recovered from the possession of Baljit and his daughter Babita, close to Rampal
 
 
 darasal, police ko babita ke paas se ek laptop, 6 mobile phone, 10 hard discs, 17 sidi, 3 telephone diary or paanch filein mili hai
 The police suspect that there may be many secret secrets of Baba in these things
 
 
 phir chaahe wo raaj andbar ke kaarobaar kii ho yaa phir kisi or dhandhe kii yahi vajah he ki police ek taraf jahaan search warrant lekar is ashram kaa konaa-konaa chaan rahi he, vahiin wo apane saath kuch sibar exparts kii team liye bhi gum rahi he taaki in electronic divises main chhipe raaj baahar nikaale ja saken
 
 
 Objectionable and obscene material found in the fields around the ashram is also not beyond the scope of investigation

 In the lockup, the first night of Rampal must have hit Baba's back on the ground
 hawalat main pehali raat rampal ek second bhi nahin soya
 Night passed in the woods
 kaal kothri main baba ne niwala bhi nahin chakhaa
 Just asked for a bottle of water

 After receiving notice of contempt of court by the Supreme Court, Justice CS Karnan of Kolkata High Court has questioned the right of the Supreme Court to hold a notice to any sitting judge
 saath hi unhone ek baar phir aarope lagaaya he ki oonchi jati ke jaj, ek dalit jaj se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye apane adhikaron kaa najayas istemaal kar rahe hai
 Before proceeding further, let us tell you that Justice Karnan is the same one who has been accusing the judges before and current of 2011 that he has been harassed by other judges because of his (karnan's) being a Dalit
 2016 main justise karnan ne supreme court colegium dwaara unke kolkata hoicourt main transfar kiye jane ke aadesh par kaha tha ki unhen dukh he ki vah bharat main paidaa hue hai or vah aise desh main janaa chaahate hai jahaan jatvaad na ho
 The patience of the Supreme Court was exceeded when in January this year, Karnan wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and accused the judges of the Supreme Court and the Madras High Court (where he was earlier posted) of corruption
 saath hi unhone apni chitthee main maujuuda or sevanivrutt ho chuke 20 jajon ke naam bhi likhe
 The Supreme Court then issued a notice to Justice Karnan on 8 February asking why it should not be considered contempt of court
 gauratlab he ki is tarah kaa notice paane vaale karnan hoicourt ke pehle sitting jaj hai
 The comments ab karnan ne is notice ke jawaab main kaha he ki supreme court ko hoicourt ke maujuuda jaj ko notice bhejne kaa kya adhikaar he
 Karnan said that the Supreme Court can move a contempt case against him in Parliament if he wants
 angreji akhbaar hindustan times ne daawa kiya he ki supreme court ke notice ke jawaab main karnan dwaara likhi gai chitthee kii copy unke paas uplabdh he
 According to the newspaper, Karnan has written that 'this order does not follow any logic, so it is not good in terms of implementation
 is aadesh ke lakshan safataur par dikhaate hai ki kis tarah kanoon oonchi jati ke jajon ke haath main he or vah apni nyaayik takaton ko anusuchit jati / janajati ke jaj se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye iskaa beja istemaal kar rahe hai
 Hence the self-induced contempt order issued on 8 February 2017 cannot survive under the law
 ' Let me tell you that Justice Karnan, posted in Kolkata High Court, was appointed Additional Judge of Madras High Court in March 2009
 iske baad vah lagaataar jajon or supreme court ke khilaaf apane alag alag bayanon kii vajah se surkhiyon main bane rahe
 The most discussed came when he wrote a letter to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes in 2011 that he was oppressed by other judges because of his being a Dalit
 unhone yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki duusare jaj unhen chota sabit karne par tule hote hai
 Giving an example, he had said that in a wedding program, another judge took his feet away thinking that Karnan's leg would not touch him
 karnan kii bataur jaj niyukti karne kii sifarish karne vaale hoicourt colegium ke teen main se ek jaj ne pichley saal saarvajanik taur par karnan kii niyukti karne ke liye maafee maangi thi

 joshi ne supaul ko darbhanga se jodne vaale 1
 Inaugurating the 8 km long Kosi Mahasetu, the political corridors created a stir when the state Chief Minister Nitish Kumar tied the bridge
 joshi ne is avasar par jo bhi kaha, vah bihar ke congressi netaaon kaa khun jalaane ke liye kaaphi tha
 His words were like, "there are very few people who can fulfill their dreams
" nitish kumaar unheen logon main se hai
 i am happy that Bihar is progressing under his leadership
 ''is maukey ne joshi ko apane rajnatik virdohi ke prati atyadhik udaartaa dikhaane ko prerit kar diya

 76 meter chaude kosi pul ne ab greater mithila ke do hisson ko aapas main jod diya he
 They were separated from each other by the strong current of Kosi river
 is nadi par angrejon ke jamaane kaa pul 1934 main aae bukamp main gir gaya tha
 So the people of the two neighboring districts (madhubani and Supaul) had to go through Nepal to reach each other's district
 ab is pul kii vajah se madhubani pahunchane main do ghante se bhi kam kaa samay lagegaa jabaki pehle 8-10 ghante lagate the
 Not only this, money will also be saved
 magar joshi or nitish ke bich manch par vah kshanik milansaarita rajya ke rashtriya rajmargon ko lekar bihar or centre ke bich matbhedon ko dur nahin kar saki
 Knowing that the improved condition of roads has given considerable political advantage to the NDA government in Bihar, the Center has left the national highways destitute
 bihar main desh kaa nauvaan sabase lanbaa rashtriya rajmargon kaa jaal he, or yah puri tarah se khastahal or gaddhon se bharaa hua he
 The Bihar government wants the central government to take care of the 'decaying' national highways passing through the state
 agar vah aisa nahin kar sakati to chahta he ki vah aadhikarik taur par apni jimmedaari se pallaa jhaad le or rajya sarkaar ko apane dam par unhen sanbhaalane kaa bidaa uthaane de
 In a recent letter to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Secretary of Bihar Road Construction Department, Pratyam Amrit said, "the condition of most of the national highways is very bad
 un par vaahanon kaa chalanaa asambhav he
 Due to the plight of National Highways 101 and 103, the lives of transporters and the common man have become difficult
 ''amrit ke patr main jin do rashtriya rajmargon kaa hawala diya gaya he, ve bihar main mahatvapurn sthanon ko ek-duusare se jodne main kaaphi ahm hai
 National Highway 101 has a length of 60 km which connects Chhapra to Mohammadpur in Gopalganj district while 55 km long National Highway-103 connects Musharigharadi to Hajipur in Samastipur
 sanyog se, bihar main sadakon kii sudhari haalat rajya main badlaav kii kahani ke ahm pahalu ke rup main saamne ai he
 It started in 2006-07
 rajya path nirmaan vibhaag 13,322
 Has built 80 km of roads
 november 2010 main jab nitish baari bahumat ke saath dobaaraa satta main laute the, us samay bhi logon ke rajg main bharosa jataane kii ek badi vajah sadakon kii behatar sthiti ko mana gaya tha
 But there is also a sad aspect of this enjoyable story
 or vah he yahaan ke rashtriya rajmarg, jinaki lagaataar kharaab hoti dasha rajya sarkaar ke liye gahan chintaa kaa vishay bani hui he
 In view of this predicament, the Secretary of the Road Construction has expressed his intention to improve them through the resources of the State Government
 unhone apane patr main anurodh kiya he, ''rashtriya rajmarg kaa vimuktikaran rajya sarkaar ko unki dasha sudhaarney ke liye upyukt kadam uthaane main sakasham banayega
 The state government's suggestion of taking responsibility for national highways seems unmatched
 lekin isse rashtriya rajmargon kii dekhbhaal main ho rahi kotahi ko lekar rajya kii hataasha bhi ubhar kar saamne aati he
 Of the total 70,394 km of national highways, only 3,642 km are in Bihar
 isi kaaran rajya desh main rashtriya rajmargon ke maamle main nauven sthaan par aata he
 The poor condition of national highways in some parts has cast a shadow on Nitish's dream of people reaching Patna from any part of Bihar in six hours
 yahi nahin, rajya main rashtriya rajmargon kii durdasha is maamle main ek cese study bhi he ki kis tarah bihar kii sabhi sadaken ek samay kisi najar aati thim
 The national highways passing through Bihar have a 1,000 km stretch on which immediate attention is required to run vehicles
 bhartiya rashtriya rajmarg praadhikaran (enechaeai) maanata he ki rashtriya rajmarg sadakon ke jaal ke 2 fisadi kaa hi pratinidhitiv karte hai, lekin yah kul sadak yatayaat kaa 40 fisadi dhote hai
 National highways are very carefully constructed, in such a way the burden of traffic on them is increasing day by day
 enechaeai ke mutabik, pichley paanch saal se 10
 The number of vehicles is increasing at an annual average of 6 per cent
 yah bhi mana ja saktaa he ki rajya ke rajmargon kii jimmedaari sanbhaalane kaa rajya sarkaar kaa suzav kaaphi sochaa-samajha kadam he
 The Center has already given that Rs 1,000 crore to the state government
 lautaane se inkaar kar diya he jo bihar ne pichley kuch saalon main rashtriya rajmargon kii dekh-rekh par kharch kiye hai
 Bihar had to spend this money from its treasury cell because the condition of roads had become so bad that there was a problem in the arrival of trains
 jabaki centre sarkaar is ore koi dhyaan hi nahin de rahi thi
 1951 passing through Bihar using this amount
 51 kimi rashtriya rajmargon ke punarnirmaan ke liye kiya gaya tha
 But the central government argues that the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways will not pay the state money for the work it did not ask for
 udhar, bihar ke path nirmaan mantri nand kishor yadav bhi isse khafa hai
 He says, "we get our Rs 1,000 crore from the central government
 kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kah-kah kar thak gaye hai
 She neither returns the money to Bihar nor does it care for the national highways
 isliye hamane unase rajya main padane vaale rashtriya rajmargon kaa jimmaa khud uthaane ko kaha he
 "even Chief Minister Nitish Kumar informed the Prime Minister about this, but no solution could be found to this issue stuck between the two governments
" kehete hai na ki doodh kaa jala chacha bhi phoonk-phoonk kar peetaa he
 Something similar is also with Bihar
 is baar rashtriya rajmargon par rajya kaa paisa kharch karne se pehle vah ab centre se ijaajat maang rahaa he

 Opener Gautam Gambhir called India a strong World Cup contender this time on the strength of strong batting but also cautioned his fellow players that they would have to avoid the pressure of expectations at the Cricket Mahakumbh starting February 19
 gambhir ne kaha ki bhartiya team pichley kuch varshon se dabaav main acha pradarshan kar rahi he lekin unhone sweekaar kiya ki khilaadiyon ke liye apekshaaon ko jhelana aasaan nahin hoga
 The left-handed batsman told the Aaj Tak channel, 'it is very important for us to meet the expectations of the audience well, although it is not easy
 gharelu darshak kaaphi dabaav banaate hai lekin yadi khilaadi kisi cheez ko lekar man main dar bitha detaa he to isse gadabadi ho sakati he
 This can be harmful for the team
 ’gambhir ne kaha ki is baar jo bhi team acchhee tarah se dabaav jhelane main safal rahegi vahi jeet darj karegi
 He said, 'the good news for us is that we have been doing well under pressure for the last few years
 dakshin africa main hamane shandaar pradarshan kiya tathaa bhale hi ham shrinkhalaa nahin jeet paye lekin hamaara manobal badha hua he tathaa hamen lagata he ki ham duniya main kahin bhi jeet darj kar sakate hai
 'gambhir said,' The result is not in our hands but we will contribute 100 percent and if we perform to the best of our ability, it could be our World Cup
 ’ dakshin africa ke khilaaf test shrinkhalaa ke dauraan haath main chot lagane ke kaaran swadesh lautne vaale gambhir ko vishwaas he ki vah jald hi puri tarah feet ho jaaenge
 He said, 'I have started A5 Yas on the nets
 haalanki ab bhi kuch sujan he lekin main jald hi puri tarah feet ho jaaunga
 Gambhir knows that in the presence of Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, he will not get a chance to open the innings and hence he is mentally ready to bat at number three
 unhone kaha, ‘main bahut utsahit hum kyonki yah meraa pehla vishwacap he
 i know that i will not get a chance to start the innings and play at number three, so my role will be different
 jab aap pari kii shuruyaat karte ho to aakraamak hokar khelte ho lekin number teen par aapako pari aage badhaani hoti he
 i am thinking about my role right now

 ek tivi kaarykram ke dauraan musharraf se jab poocha gaya ki kya donon desh kisi qaraar ke kareeb the to unhone kaha, ‘‘haa bilkul
 Kashmir, Siachen and Sir Creek were close on all three issues
 ’’musharraf ne kaha, ‘‘maine pradhanmantri manmohan singh se kaha tha or vah taiyaar bhi ho gayi the
 It was his turn to come to Pakistan and we had decided that if he comes and even if not all three are right but one of these three is not signed then it will be a complete failure, which should never happen
 isliye ham is baat par raji ho gayi ki jab vah aate hai to in teenon main se kam se kam ek par samjhauta hoga
 When Musharraf was asked if the issue was Sir Creek, he said, "yes, Sir Creek was more likely, but good progress was made on both

 ’’niyantran rekha kaa vichaar apraasangik thamushrraf ke anusaar kashmir mudda teen siddhanton par aadhaarit tha, visanikaran, swashaasan or sanyukt pranali
 He said that it was his idea that demilitarization should continue in Kashmir and along the Line of Control

 My suggestion was that the Indian Army should withdraw from two or three cities like Srinagar, Baramulla
 ’’ swashaasan se musharraf kaa aashay he, ‘‘bharat kii taraf or pakistan kii taraf, donon hi taraf kashmir ke logon ko adhiktam shashan dena
 The purpose of the joint system is to monitor self-government
 musharraf ne kaha ki jahaan tak kashmir kii baat he, pakistan main niyantran rekha banane kaa vichaar apraasangik tha
 "the problem was the Line of Control because there was a perception that the Indian side wanted the Line of Control to be made permanent," he said

 Therefore the idea of creating a Line of Control was irrelevant

 Social worker Anna Hazare had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing his displeasure over corruption and problems of farmers
 haalanki letters kaa jawaab nahin milane par ab anna ne andolan karne kaa faisla liya he
 Anna wrote in the letter that even after six years, not a single law to prevent corruption could be implemented
 lokapal, lokayukta kii niyukti karne vaale or bhrashtachar ko rokanevaale sabhi shashakt bilon par sarkaar susti dikhaa rahi he
 The Swaminathan Commission report on the problems of farmers is also not being implemented
 sarkaar ke is ravaie se naaraaz anna hajaare ne letters main tamaam masalon ke bare main likhaa tha or ab koi jawaab nahin milane par dilli main andolan karne kaa faisla liya he
 It has been 6 years since Anna Hazare of the movement had organized a movement in Ramlila Maidan in 2011 to create a corruption-free India
 iske baad 27 agast 2011 ke din bhartiya sansad main ‘sense of the House’ se rigyulation paas kiya gaya tha
 In this, the Lokpal at the Center, the Lokayukta and Citizen's Charter in every state were decided to enact laws on such important issues at the earliest
 iske baad anna hajaare ne apana andolan sthagit kar diya tha
 6 years have passed since this
 'bijepi ne nahin nibhaayaa apana vaada'anna hajaare ne modi ko likhe gaye letters main kaha kilokapal or lokayuktakaanoon banate samay sansad ke dono sadanon main vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaa rahi bijepi ne bhi is kanoon ko pura samarthan diya tha
 After this, your party formed a government in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 lokapal andolan ke baad desh kii janata ne badi ummid se aapke netritv main nai sarkaar ko chunaa tha
 At the same time it was necessary to give sufficient time to the new government to implement the issues
 anna hajaare ne pichley teen saalon main kai baar patr likhane kaa zikr bhi kiya, lekin piemo se koi jawaab nahin mila
 Not only this, the Lokpal and Lokayukta were mentioned in Mann Ki Baat
 unhone likhaa he ki satta main aane se pehle aapane aashwaasan diya tha ki bhrashtachar mukt bharat banaaenge
 However, you could not appoint Lokpal and Lokayukta for 3 years
 supreme court ne bhi aapaki sarkaar ko baar-baar fatkaar lagaai he
 Modi said that Lokayuktas have not been appointed under the new law even in states where BJP governments are in place
 isse ye saaf he ki aap lokapal, lokayukta kanoon par amal karne ke liye ichhashakti nahin dikhaa rahe hai
 Anna Hazare also mentioned about the farmers' suicides in the country
 anna ke anusaar, maujuuda vakt main kheti paidaawari main kisaanon ko laagat par aadhaarit daam mili isliye maine kai baar patr likhaa tha
 However, no response came from your side nor did the Swaminathan Committee report take action
 isi vajah se pichley kai dinon se maharashtra, madhyapradesh, tamilnadu, andhrapradesh, telangna, haryana, rajasthan main kisaan andolan kar rahe hai
 Also, in the letter, Anna also demanded to bring political parties under the purview of information
 ab andolganna hajaare ne patr ke jariye kaha ki pichley 3 saal main aapaki sarkaar ne kisi patr kaa jawaab nahin diya
 For this, i have now decided to agitate in Delhi
 jab tak letters main likhen muddon par janhit main sahi nirnay or amal nahin hota tab tak main andolan dilli main jari rakhunga
 Anna Hazare has said in the next letter to announce the date of the movement

 In the eyes of Narendra Modi, known for his intentions to change the way government functions and the economy, the ideal role of the government, Bilashak, is completely different from its predecessors
 unka maananaa he ki sarkaar kaa aakaar-prakaar kii utani ahmiyat nahin
 They say that its scope should be as short as possible
 pradhanmantri do jumalon kaa tabhi se aksar istemaal karte hai, jabase unhone gujarat ke mukhyamantri pad se upar uthakar rashtriya manch par apni majboot maujuudagi darj kerani shuru kii
 These are "minimum government, maximum good governance" and "doing business is not the government's job
" '' unke aalochak maanate hai ki ye jumale arthvyavastha or prashasan ke maamle main bahut had tak unki soch ke pratibimb hai
 In a country which has never seen a clearly right-wing pro-market trend in politics and political system, these two jumplings clearly symbolize the arrival of Modi era
 yah yug aaazaad bharat main pehali dfa dakshinpanth kii ore jhuki kisi sarkaar kaa he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who has been called Modi's right hand in the Union Cabinet, laid the red carpet for this Modi economy on 28 February
 haalanki abhi puri tarah se nahin bichaaya he
 The budget did not expand the scope of the government but in some cases the government roles also stopped from being reduced
 apane 11,500 se adhik shabdon ke bajet bhaashan main unhone jo kuch kaha, use modi sarkaar kaa upyukt, napa-tula dakshinpanth kii ore jhukaa bajet kaha ja saktaa he
 This budget, even if not entirely market-oriented, is enough to entice both big and small businessmen and domestic and foreign companies who are ready to partner in 'make in India'
 jetali ne pichhali july main apane pehle antarim bajet main sabko khush karne kii koshish kii thi, lekin apane pehle purna bajet main unhone thode samay ke liye logon ko khush karne ke laalach se bachane kii koshish kii he
 There is no attempt to woo the general public with the populist measures of the social sector nor the corporate world by announcing major reforms
 nishchay hi jetali ne congress ke netritv main pichhali upie sarkaar ke saath lokapriyata kii jang ke akhaade main utarane se inkaar kiya he
 The way UPA has in the 2006 budget is Rs 11,000 crore for the first 200 districts under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme
 kaa aavanton kiya tha or 2009 main badhaakar 40,000 karod ru
 Had it been done, the absence of such heavy allocation would have provided relief to the supporters and investors of fiscal control

 Jaitley has made a double move in this direction: one, by 2019, promised to reduce the company tax from the current 30 percent to 25 percent gradually and also reshaped the tax structure to attract capital
 jetali ne elaan kiya, ''maujuuda kar dhaancha fund prabandhakon ko videshon se kaamkaaj chalaane ke liye protsaahit karata he
 In order to encourage such fund managers working from foreign locations to visit India, i propose amendments to the Permanent Establishment (PE) rules to the effect that mere presence of the fund manager in India does not mean PE of foreign funds Due to which they had to bear the burden of tax
 ''isse pataa chalata he ki unka antim lakshya kya he-singapore or malaysia se kaam karne vaale fund prabandhakon ko bharat main thikaana banane ke liye protsaahit karnaa

 Moving a step further away from the earlier left-leaning economy, Jaitley has also indicated some small steps towards a market-driven social security system, so that the government does not bear all the responsibility like a food guarantee or employment guarantee scheme
 Beneficiaries also bear some part of it

 Manmohan Singh is the Chairman of the Commission
 unhone apane sambodhan main kaha ki yojana ayog ko vaishvikaran ke nae daur main apane ko sarthak banaae rakhane ke liye nae rup main dhaalnaa chahie
 Recalling his long association with the Commission, the Prime Minister said, as the economy is constantly becoming more open and liberalized and dependence on the market system is increasing progressively, the Planning Commission will have to think about what its role should be in this new world
 upie ke 10 varsh ke shasankaal ke dauraan ayog ke kaamkaaj par santosh vyakt karte hue pradhanmantri ne ummid jataai ki yojana ayog apane ko aalochanatmak samiksha ke liye prastut karegaa or sarkaar kii nitigat charchaaon tathaa hamaare desh ke vikaas main agrani bhoomika nibhaataa rahegaa
 Manmohan said in the meeting that in the changing economic environment, the Commission should evaluate its approach to problems and challenges
 unhone baithak main kuch mudde uthaate hue kaha, hamen yah dekhnaa hoga ki kya ham abhi vahi upkaran or drushtikon apanaae hue hai, jo duusare jamaane ke liye dizin kiye gaye the? kya hamane ayog kii paramparaagat gatividhiyon kaa punargathan kiye bina hi usamen nae kaam jod die or nai paraten chadha di hai

 sadarland ne kaha, 'bharat ho saktaa he ki is baar is par raji na ho lekin mujhe abhi bhi bharosa he ki yah formet bhavishya he
 Everyone knows this in world cricket
 ' unhone kaha, 'saaf taur par kahuun to vah yahaan aakar hamen haraa sakate hai
 It is a fact that Australia has not lost any Test match in day-night format yet
 ho saktaa he ki isse unhen lagata ho ki yah hamaare liye ek badhat vaali baat he
 The Indian team will be touring Australia from 21 November to 19 January at the end of this year where they will play three T20 matches, four Tests and three ODI series
