 yadi aap divaani (civil) cese karte hai, to court aapako motaa muaavja dilaa saktaa he
 In such a case, the court tries to provide maximum compensation to the aggrieved party, so that fear can arise in the doctors due to negligence on their duty
 balram prasad banaam kunal saaha ke maamle main supreme court aitihaasik faisla suna chukaa he
 In this, the top court has given compensation of Rs 6 crore and Rs 8 lakh to the victim Kunal Saha
 supreme court ne apane faisle main kaha tha ki kunal saaha kii patni anuraadhaa saaha ke ilaaj main doctoron ne laaparvaahee barti, jiske chalate unki maut ho gai
 Therefore, for negligence in treatment, Kolkata-based AMRI Hospital should pay a compensation of Rs 6 crore and Rs 8 lakh to the victim Kunal Saha with 6 percent interest
 kya kahata he kanoon?agar aap ilaaj main laaparvaahee baratane ke liye doctor ke khilaaf criminal cese karnaa chaahate hai, to bhartiya dand samhita yani ipisi kii dhara 304-A, 337 or 338 ke tahat praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Under these sections a doctor can have both a sentence of six months to two years and a fine
 doctor kii laaparvaahee ke maamle main edwocket kalika prasad kaala ‘maanas’ kaa kahana he ki doctor kii yah legal duty he ki wo puri saavdhaanee or satarkta ke saath marij kaa ilaaj kare
 If the doctor is negligent in treatment, both criminal and civil liability is incurred on him (the doctor)
 matlab ilaaj main laaparvaahee baratane par doctor ke khilaaf criminal kaarywahi yaa phir civil kaarywahi kii ja sakati he
 Apart from this, under the Consumer Protection Act, a doctor can be sued in the Consumer Forum
 edwocket kaala kaa kahana he ki agar ilaaj main doctor kii laaparvaahee ke chalate marij kii maut ho jaati he, to bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 304-A ke tahat cese kiya ja saktaa he
 If the court finds the doctor guilty of negligence in treatment, he can face both a sentence of two years and a fine
 haalanki, criminal maamle main mens rea yani krime karne ke iraade (criminal intention) ko sabit karnaa behad jaruri he
 Civil proceedings more convenient Advocate Kala says that civil proceedings are more convenient than criminal proceedings and it is quite easy to prove the doctor's civil liability
 unhone bataaya ki civil cese doctor ke saath hi aspataal, health centre or nursing home ke khilaaf bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, a substantial compensation can be obtained by filing a lawsuit in the Consumer Forum under the Consumer Protection Act
 edwocket kaala kaa kahana he ki aise maamle main court mritak marij kii umr, shiksha or kamai ke aadhaar par muaavja tay karata he
 How to know whether the doctor was negligent in treatment or not? Advocate Kalika Prasad Kala says that the doctor has a legal duty to care for the patient
 agar doctor ne marij ke care karne kii duty ko nahin nibhaayaa, to vah ilaaj main laaparvaahee kaa doshi mana jayega
 Whether or not the doctor performed his duty can be understood from three points
 
 
 
 
 
 1
 doctor ne jis marij ko ilaaj ke liye bhartee kiya he, kya vah us marij kaa ilaaj karne main sakasham he yaa nahin? matlab yah ki kya doctor ke paas us marij kaa ilaaj karne kii profeshnal skill he yaa nahin? agar uske paas profeshnal skill nahin he or usne paise ke laalach main yaa phir kisi duusare iraade se marij ko bhartee kar liya he, to doctor ko ilaaj main laaparvaahee kaa jimmedaar mana jayega
 2
 kya doctor ne marij kii beemaari ke anusaar ilaaj kiya he yaa nahin? matlab agar marij ko tibi he, to doctor ko tibi kii hi dawa deni chahie
 He cannot give cancer to a TB patient
 agar wo aise karata he, to usko ilaaj main laaparvaahee kaa doshaa mana jayega
 3
 kya doctor puri imaardaari or saavdhaanee ke saath marij kaa ilaaj kar rahaa he yaa nahin? agar doctor ne puri saavdhaanee ke saath marij kaa ilaaj nahin kiya, to vah ilaaj main laaparvaahee kaa jimmedaar mana jayega

 After a month and a half of finding Bhanwari Devi, a missing nurse in the state, to save one of her ministers, the main bench of Jodhpur in the High Court termed the Gehlot government as the weakest government ever
 peeth bhavari ke pati amarchand kii bandi pratyakshikaran yachika par sunwaayee kar rahi thi
 Bhanwari, a folklorist nurse who was raised in high political circles, was living a good life despite earning a poor background
 1 sitambar ko vah jodhpur ke bilada se ekaek laapata ho gai
 Describing the progress report filed by the police as "worth throwing in the trash", the court decided to monitor the case on a daily basis
 nyaayamurti govind maathur or nyaayamurti narendra kumaar jain kii khandpeeth ne maamla sibiai ko saunpane ke rajya sarkaar ke faisle ko palaayanwadee bataaya kyonki vah apane ek cabinet mantri ke khilaaf jaanch karne se bachanaa chaahati thi
 Home Minister Shanti Dhariwal told the media in September that the matter was being referred to the CBI because of the name of Mahipal Maderna, the Minister of Public Health and Engineering, in the investigation
 sthaneey media ne court kii tippaniyon ko pramukhataa se chapa or dikhaaya
 The CBI, which is going to take the case in its hand, asked for at least six months' time to find out if the court said, "we are not going to wait even for six days
" '' agle din sunwaayee ke vakt usne yah or joda ki maamla sibiai ko saunp dene se rajya sarkaar kii jimmedaari khatm nahin ho jaati
 In a complaint written 18 days after the original FIR was lodged and Amarchand in the habeas corpus petition, Maderna has been described as the main suspect
 uskaa aarope he ki bhavari ke saath aapattijanak dasha main apni ek video recording karwaakar usee ko dikhaa karke ve uske saath baar-baar balaatkaar karte the
 No case has been registered against Maderna yet
 jaanchakartaaon kaa maananaa he ki bhavari ke apharan ke peeche use khatm karne kii manshaa thi kyonki uske paas yaa to tepe yaa phir video recording kii sidi thi
 Gehlot has said that no one has seen the video
 aise main suni-sunai baton ke aadhaar par koi nateeja nikaalnaa thik nahin
 "actually, Gehlot is running to save himself
 is maamle main agar ve maderna ko nishaanaa banaate dikhe to unki jaan saansat main funs jaaegi kyonki maderna diggaj jat netaa parsaram maderna ke bete hai
 The Jats are in a decisive role in eight of the 25 Lok Sabha seats in the state and on 35 of the 200 assembly seats
 jat paaramparik rup se congress ke voter the par apane pichley kaarykaal main gahalot ne jaaton ko pichde varg kaa darja die jane kaa virodh kiya to ve congress se chhitakane lage
 Parasram Maderna gave Gehlot his first ticket to the parliamentary elections in 1977, but Gehlot defeated him in 1998 for the post of Chief Minister
 maamle ko sibiai ko saunpe jane ko jat maderna ko pareshaan karne kii gahalot kii tarkeeb maan rahe hai
 Dhariwal has been asking for the matter to be given to CBI with the consent of Maderna
 par sutara to kuch or hi kahani bataate hai
 Maderna agreed not to consider it as a big case and to conduct a proper investigation
 dhariwal ne jab unhen bataaya ki gahalot maamla sibiai ko saunpane kaa faisla kar chuke hai, to maderna ne kaha, ''aap pehle hi faisla kar chuke hai to phir isamen main kya kah saktaa hum? baahar to main yahi kanga ki isamen meri sahmati he
 Shocked by the move, Maderna mobilized a large number of fraternity leaders — including BJP leaders — to show that the Jats were with him at the father's birthday celebration on 5 October
 vipakshi bhaajapa ne is maamle main sadhi chuppi akhriyaar karke rakhi he
 If a lighter is shown with Maderna, the authorized attitude has been to demand his dismissal
 india today ko pataa chalaa he ki june main jab ek mahila kaa ek video tepe dikhaakar ek mantri se 1
 5 crores Rs
 maangane kii khabaren sthaneey media main chhapin to apana paksh rakhane ke liye maderna gahalot se mili
 Gehlot asked Congress MLA Malkhan Singh Bishnoi suspected of a video dispute
 malakhan saalon se bhavari ke ghanishtha ke rup main jane jate the
 He was also special to Maderna, but due to local politics a few years ago, both of them got upset
 gahalot kii salaah par maderna ne malakhan se baat karne kii koshish kii lekin unhone koi tavajjo hi nahin di
 Those close to Maderna believe that Amarchand went on to name him as a suspect much later under pressure from his political opponents
 maderna ne bhavari se kab baat kii, is bare main amarchand apane bayaan badalata rahaa haih bhavari ke gaayab hone ke do hafte se lekar chaar saal pehle tak
 Get the police
 parade ke peeche vah sabhi sandigdhon ko maderna ke behad kareeb bataati rahi lekin unako usne sawaalon kii ek suchi tak bhejnaa munasib nahin samajha
 The absconding Shahabuddin is a prime suspect in the case, accused in an earlier murder case
 uski bolero gaadi gujarat ke palanpur se baraamad hui thi, jisamen se kuch bal-sandigdh rup se bhavari ke-bhi paae gaye the
 In Palanpur, stolen vehicles are often sold
 osiyaan ke thanedaar lakhan singh bhavari devi ke apharan ke maamle main sandigdh bhoomika ke maddenjar nilambit hai
 It is said that Bhanwari was brought to Osian from Bilada
 police ne pehle maderna ke ek kareebi thekedaar sohanlal bishnoi ko giraftaar kiya tha
 He is the cousin of Malkhan Singh but the police claim that the two had no contact before long after the accident
 police ke mutabik, uski jaanch bataati he ki kathith video baraamad hone ke baad bhavari ko agava kar use khatm kar diya janaa tha
 But another aspect of the story is under discussion: Bhanwari went missing under the Prana triangle with Malkhan and Maderna
 apharan ke din jodhpur ke purv up-jila pramukh sahiram bishnoi ne sohanlal bishnoi se phone par 27 baar baat kii thi
 Maderna has been the district head of Jodhpur for more than two decades
 unki jagah ab unki patni lila maderna ne le lee he
 Now the absconding Sahiram was at Maderna's official residence at the time of the call
 sohanlal ne shahabuddin ko phone kiya
 Govardhan, a colleague of Maderna, has also been questioned regarding calling Shahabuddin
 maderna ke najdiki log video recording hone kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kar rahe hai lekin is par unka kahana he ki maan lijie, vah mil gai to uske baad uski satyata kii bhi jaanch kerani padegi naa
 His people, besides opposing the removal of Maderna without any basis, also call it wrong to drag them in this case
 maderna ke nazdikiyon kaa kahana he, ''maan lijie ki bhavari devi jinda laut aati he yaa phir maderna kaa siyaasi kareer khatm karne ke liye unhen virodhiyon ne maan lijie, use kahin bhaga diya ho or vah kabhi na mili to?''jahaan tak maderna kii baat he to ve kehete hai ki unhone chal rahi jaanch kaa sammaan karne ke vaaste chuppi dhaaran kar rakhi he ''lekin ise meri kamajori na samaj jaae
 "overall, Gehlot has emerged weaker than Maderna due to the mysterious disappearance of Bhanwari Devi

 As is common practice, the governor calls the leader of the largest party or the pre-election coalition to form the government

 In Karnataka, the Congress and JDS did not have a pre-poll alliance

 Speakers at the national seminar on 'role of Media in Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan' at Paradkar Bhavan said that media will play an important role in making Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan a success
 visheshgyon ne kaha ki logon ko is kanoon ke bare main jaagruk karne main media yadi apni bhoomika puri tarah se nibhaayegaa to aam logon tak iske laabh aasaani se pahunchaaye ja sakate hai

 isliye kisi bhi raashtra ko apane vikaas kii aadharshila uchit shiksha pranali lagu karke rakhni hogi
 He said that the foundation of the current education system implemented in India was laid by Lord Macaulay on February 2, 1935, whose basic objective was to destroy the Indian education and culture and prepare an army of Babus for their global empire

 Due to this, the duration and expenditure amount for this campaign continued to increase, but the campaign remained far away from success

 The Government of India has not been able to achieve the main objective of this campaign by spending trillions of rupees from 2001 to 2010, but as usual the period for achieving this goal was extended till 2017
 ab sarkaar ke liye yah jaruri ho gaya he ki vah is abhiyaan ko safal banane ke liye naukarshahi par lagaam kase tab jaakar hi is abhiyaan ko safalataa mil sakati he
 The role of media is also very important in this direction

 kaam nahin aa rahaa dalit ke ghar bhojan kaa daanvadlit samudaay kii BJP ke prati vyapak naaraazgi ke maahaul ko bhaanpate hue modi sarkaar ne daliton ko rijhaane ke uddeshy se daliton ke ghar bhojan karne kaa baqayada ek abhiyaan shuru kiya
 The BJP resorted to the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan to woo the Dalits
 14 april se 5 may tak chale is abhiyaan main bhaajapa sarkaar ke mantri or netaa daliton kii nabj tatolane doordaraj ke gaanv pahunche, raat main chaoupal lagaai lekin laav-lashkar ke saath daliton ke ghar bhojan karne kii kavayad ne vivaadon ko hi janm diya
 Now whether it is a matter of asking for food from outside of the Union Minister SS Ahluwalia at Begusarai in Bihar and eating at the house of Dalit, whether it is the sugarcane development minister Suresh Rana of UP government, handmade spinach paneer, makhani dal, chickpeas made by the Dalit family here , Raita, Tandoor, Coffee, Rasgulla and Mineral Water
 daliton ke ghar modi ke mantri bhojan raajnneeti to kar rahe the, lekin kai baar unki ut-pataang bayaanbajiyon ne khel ulta kar diya
 Anupama Jaiswal, a minister in the Yogi government, raised the issue of mosquito bites overnight in the house of Dalits, while another minister in the Yogi government, Rajendra Pratap, compared himself to Lord Rama, saying that Rama also ate Shabri's yoke plum
 
 yahaan tak ki modi sarkaar main mantri savitri bai phule ne to daliton ke ghar bhojan kii raajnneeti ko daliton kaa apmaan tak kah daalaa
 The official mechanism on reservation may be as much as the Modi government may make claims about some Dalits, but it has not yet achieved the full confidence of the country's Dalit community
 darasal iske peeche sirf kathani-kerani kaa hi fark nahin he, balki desh kii nai raajnneeti ko prabhavit karne vaali soshal media kaa bhi bahut bada haath he
 From Bihar assembly elections to Karnataka assembly elections from time to time, opposition parties have been showing fear of ending the reservation given to Dalits and Other Backward Classes by the Modi government
 vastav main daliton ko vipaksh ke is daawey main kuch had tak sachai bhi najar aati he, kyonki soshal media par is tarah kii baaten lagaataar uthati rahi hai, jisamen aarakshan ko desh ke pichhadepan kii badi buraai ke rup main pradarshit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 In these messages going viral on social media, Dalits and other backward communities are targeted for their intellectual backwardness under the pretext of reservation
 ekataraf to khud pradhanmantri modi kai baar kah chuke hai ki koi bhi is desh se aarakshan ko khatm nahin kar saktaa, lekin soshal media par unka prachaar tantra lagaataar aarakshan ke khilaaf janamanas banane main laga dikh rahaa he
 Now let us take a recent incident, when a dozen people of an under-construction bridge in the Prime Minister's Parliamentary constituency Varanasi fell near a dozen people
 iske baad soshal media par is tarah ke sandesh prasaarit hue ki 'jis desh main aadhe ejeeniyar aarakshan se banate hon, us desh main nirmaanadhin pul ke girane par kya aashcharya'
 The Supreme Court's decision directed the Dalit angry court across the country to make a major change in the Dalit Atrocities Act on 20 March this year
 supreme court ne kaha ki dalit atroceties act ke tahat FIR darj karne se pehle tafteesh kii jaae or praarambhik jaanch main shikaayat vaazib paae jane ke baad hi exiaar darj kii jaae
 The Supreme Court also spoke about changes in the Dalit Atrocities Act
 supreme court ke is aadesh ko dalit utpeedan kanoon ko kamjor karne vaala mana gaya
 The Modi government was also criticized for this decision of the Supreme Court, saying that the government did not place concrete arguments before the court, due to which the Supreme Court gave such a direction
 supreme court ke is aadesh par deshbhar main dalit samudaay bhadak uthaa or april main darjan bhar rajyon main hinsa kii aag bhadak uthi
 This movement of Dalits became violent and lasted for several days
 daliton ke is andolan main desh ke vibhinn hisson se darjan bhar se zyada logon kii maut kii khabar ai

 The demolition of the Lenin statue became a political event in its own right after the formation of the BJP government in Nishamanipur, which became the statues of Ambedkar
 lenin kii murti kaa tootna phir supreme court ke aadesh kaa aana or ambedkar ko lekar bhaajapa kii badali raajnneeti
 As a result of all this, reports of Ambedkar's statues being broken from various parts of the country started coming
 ise savarnon ne daliton ke khilaaf bade raajnneetik sandesh ke rup main istemaal kiya
 The rupture of Ambedkar's statues also became a bone in the throat of the Modi government
 jagah-jagah ambedkar kii murti kii raksha ke liye yaa to pulicekarmi tainaat kiye jane lage yaa ambedkar kii murti ko lohi kii jaali main taala lagaakar surakshit kiya gaya
 Even insensitive to the oppression of Dalit, the oppression against Dalits has always been seen as a social problem and governments have been adopting indirect methods to solve it
 lekin beete chaar varshon ke dauraan kuch aise vaakye hue, jinase aisa lagane laga ki ab yah saamaajik roodhi se aage badhkar sarkari utpeedan kaa rup le chukaa he
 Because in most of the Dalit oppression cases, the administrative staff's insensitivity has come out
 ab chaahe vah uttar pradesh ke kasganj mendlit duulhe kii baratko savarnon kii basti se nikalne kii ijaajat na dene kaa faisla ho yaa madhya pradesh ke ujjain main daliton ko baraat kii teen din pehle se soochna dene kaa nirdesh
 There are frequent cases of misconduct of the upper castes with the procession of Dalit grooms or Dalits from different parts of the country
 apane hi dalit mantri aae virodh menmodi sarkaar ke liye dalit utpeedan ke mudde par tab sarvaadhik musiibat kaa saamana karnaa padaa, jab uske hi kaidlit mantriparty ke khilaaf uth khadey hue

 janvari main vimaanan sambandhi nirmaan kaary karne vaali company prisizan castaparts se barkshaayar ne 32
 Deal was done for 36 billion dollars
 yah barkshaayar ke itihaas kaa sabase bada adhigrahan tha
 Since then, Buffett has been sitting on a heap of cash which has been steadily increasing day by day
 niveshak endi kilpatric kaa kahana he ki mujhe lagata he ki vah sahi keemat chukaate hue kisi shandaar (deal) kii talash main he
 Let me tell you, Andy wrote a book called 'of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffet'
 vaise saaf kar den ki barkshaayar ke paas jitna bhi nakadi he, vah sab kaa sab 'avelable' nahin he
 Actually, the company has to keep at least $ 20 billion in its possession so that the insurance companies of Berkshire can use this money in times of any major claim or any other need
 baffe hameshaa kehete hai ki vah barkshaayar ke paimaanon main 'feet' ho sakane vaali companiyon ke adhigrahan ke liye har vakt nigaah rakhe hue hote hai lekin kisi bhi company ke liye vah utani hi keemat chukaayenge jitani ki unke mutabik, 'vah company kaabil he'
 George Morgan, who teaches finance at the University of Nebraska in Omaha, said - it's hard to say what he is looking for, we can just wait

 But it is not clear when such a deal will happen between the two
 haal philhal byaaj daron ko lekar jo maahaul kaayam he usamen barkshaayar apane paas ikattha nakadi se zyada byaaj nahin kama paa rahaa
 But Buffett is under no pressure from his share holders to make any acquisition as soon as possible
 yaa phir aisa bhi koi dabaav nahin he ki ve labhaansh dena shuru kar den joki barkshaayar ko 1965 main tech over karne ke baad se kabhi nahin diya gaya he
 Two years ago Berkshire stock holders themselves rejected the idea of dividend
 vaise bhi barkshaayar ke share holder 'cash ke dher' kii vailu jaanate hai, 2008 kii mandi main vah dekh chuke hai
 At the time of the 2008 recession, Buffett had offered financial assistance of billions of dollars to Goldman Sachs, General Electronic, Hurley Davidson and many others at strong interest rates
 vaise jab tak unhen koi badhiya shandaar target nahin mil jaataa or jo karte aa rahe hai, vahi karte rahenge yani ki kabhi kabhaar phone kol le lenaa, zyada bijanas reports padhanaa
 
 vah daanv lagane ke liye sahi samay kaa intjaar karenge
 In January, Berkshire 32 from aviation-related construction company precision castparts
 36 billian dollar kii deal kii thi
 It was the largest acquisition in the history of Berkshire
 tab se baffe nakadi rakam ke dher par baithe hue hai joki dinondin teji se badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Investor Andy Kilpatrick says i think he is looking for a great deal while paying the right price
 bataa den, endi ne 'of permanent vailu : da story of warren baffe' naamak kitaab likhi thi
 By the way, make it clear that all the cash that Berkshire has is not all available
 darasal, company ko apane paas kam se kam 20 billian dollar kii rakam rakhni hi he taaki barkshaayar kii insurance companiyaan is paise ko kisi bade clem yaa kisi or jarurat ke samay istemaal kar saken
 Buffett always says that he is always on the lookout for acquisitions of companies that can 'fit' in Berkshire's scale, but for any company he will pay the same price as, according to him, 'that company is worth it'
 
 omaha main uniwarsity of nebraska main finance padhaa rahe jorge morgan ne kaha- yah kahana mushkil he ki vah kya dhund rahe hai, ham sirf itanjar kar sakate hai

 The comments baffe kah chuke hai ki vah 3ji capital ke saath phir se kaam kar sakate hai
 Together, they bought Kraft Foods and Heinz
 lekin yah spasht nahin he ki donon ke bich aisi koi deal aage kab hogi
 Berkshire has not been able to earn more interest than the cash it holds in the environment currently prevailing over interest rates
 lekin baffe par unke share holders kii ore se jald se jald kisi tarah ke adhigrahan karne ko lekar koi dabaav nahin he
 Or there is no pressure to start paying dividends, which Berkshire has never given since taking over in 1965
 do saal pehle barkshaayar ke share holders ne khud hi dividend kaa idia thukraa diya tha
 As it is, Berkshire's share holders know the value of the 'pile of cash', they have seen in the 2008 recession
 2008 kii mandi ke samay baffe ne goldman sex, general electronic, harlee davidson or kai anya ko tagdi byaaj daron par arabon dollar kii vittiya 'madad' kii peshkash kii thi
 Well, until they get a very good target and keep doing what they have been doing, that is, take occasional phone calls, read more business reports

 phir atom bam kaa batan dabaane dabaane tak baat pahunchan gai
 But it is said that only talking makes a talk
 phir ek aisa vakt aayaa jab ek duusare kii jaan ke dushman bane donon netaaon ne aapas main mulaakaat kii or ab ye nazadikiyaan itani badhin kii itihaas main pehali baar kisi america raashtrapati ne 70 saal puraane apane dushman kii sarazamiin par kadam rakhaa
 Yes, the whole world was shocked when US President Donald Trump stepped on the soil of North Korea
 trump ne usee south korea kii jameen par pehla kadam rakhaa, jisase kuch dinon pehle tak uski itani dushmani thi ki donon kii vajah se duniya par parmaanu yuddh kaa khatra mandara rahaa tha
 Nobody had imagined that the two would come so close one day that Trump would become the first US president to step on Korean soil
 in donon ne naa keval mulaakaat kii balki trump ne kim jong un ko white house aane ke nyauta bhi diya
 The story of Korea is very fluctuating
 darasal, 70 saal pehle korea ek hi tha
 But later it was split into two
 ji haa
 Korea was one about 70 years ago
 magar phir wo sab kuch hua jiske baad korea ke do tukade ho gaye
 One became North Korea
 doosraa dakshin korea
 But South Korea remained quiet since Partition
 kuch vakt baad hi usne loktantr kii raah bhi paqad lee
 But what happened to North Korea that it became a bomber
 bamon or mixilon ke peeche pad gaya? dakshin korea ke saath uski dushmani phir bhi samajhi ja sakati he
 But what is his enmity with America? So to know the answers to all these questions, it is necessary to know the story of Korea
 nafaraton kii sarhadduniya ke nakshe par aaj kii taarikh main ye jo do mulk najar aate hai
 Actually he was once one
 seemaa ek thi
 People were one
 raashtra ek tha
 The Head of State was one
 magar nafrat kii buniyaad par khinchi gai sarhad kii is lakeer ne dekhte hi dekhte ise duniya kaa sabase khatarnaak border bana diya
 The country on one side of the border is called North Korea and the other side is South Korea
 korea rajvansh kii daastankoria kii ye kahani shuru hoti he sila rajvansh ke daur se
 
 kareeb 900 saal ke sila shashan main korian prayadweep main korea china auki japan se alag duniya ke nakshe par ek majboot pahchaan rakhata tha
 But by the 20th century, the grip of the Silla dynasty began to weaken over Korea
 1910 main japan ne kiya kabjakoria prayadweep main kareeb dedh dashak ke dabadabe ke baad japan ne saal 1910 main is sila rajvansh par kabza kar liya
 But with the Japanese occupation, the fire of rebellion started in this country
 korian logon ne apni azaadi ke liye kai vidrohi sanghathan bana liye
 Some of whom were Chinese and Soviet Communist supporters
 or kuch sanghathanon ko america kaa samarthan hasil tha
 The rebel Kim Sang Il, together with the Chinese communists, created a gorilla army that was competing with Japan
 1945 main japan se mili aazaadeeudhar 1939 se 1945 tak chale duusare vishwa yuddh main america dushmani japaniyon ko baari padi
 And Japan was forced to lay down its arms in this war
 isi ke saath 36 saalon kii gulaami ke baad korea japan ke changul se azaad ho gaya
 But till then the clouds of World War II were not over
 puri duniya tab do guton main bantati najar aa rahi thi
 One American bloc and the other Soviet bloc
 korian vidrohi bhi isse achoote nahin rahe
 After independence, two pieces of Korea got independence from Japan, but after Japan left Korea, there were situations like civil war in Korea
 azaadi ke liye bane gut ab do alag alag power centre main bant gaye the
 The Communist faction of Kim Il Sang, which occupied the northern part of Korea, had the support of the Soviet Union
 to korea ke dakshini hisse par apana dabadabaa kaayam kiye hae communist virdohi netaa sigaman ri ke gut ko america kaa samarthan mila hua tha
 Now the situation became such that Korea was cut into two pieces keeping in view the areas occupied by both
 vibhaajan ke baad ek uttar korea bana or doosraa dakshin korea
 August 15, 1948: Dispute after partition: This dispute of partition was just started
 japan se azaadi ke baad 1947 main america ne sanyukt raashtra ke zarie korea ko phir se ek raashtra banane kii pahal kii
 Simultaneously, with the support of the US, Segaman Ri announced the formation of the Republic of Korea in Seoul, asserting authority over the whole of Korea
 magar is ghoshnaa ke 25 din baad hi kim il sang ne bhi pyangyang main democratic pipuls republic of korea ke gathan kii ghoshnaa kar ke puure korea par apane adhikaar kaa elaan kar diya
 Despite the partition, military and political fighting between the two countries continued
 25 june 1950: dakshin korea par hamalakoria par adhikaar ko lekar abhi vivaad jari hi tha ki tabhi 25 june 1950 ko uttar korea ke shaasha kim il sang ne china or soviet union kii madad se dakshin korea par par hamalaa kar diya
 And this is where the Korean War began
 is yuddh main soviet union uttar korea kii taraf tha to america dakshin korea kii taraf
 The war went on for three years in which millions of people died
 27 july 1953: yudhviram kii ghoshnatin saal kii ladaai ke baad aakhirkaar kai deshon kii madhyastha ke baad 27 july 1953 main donon deshon ne yudhviram kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Despite this, tensions remained in both countries
 jo aaj bhi jari he
 These two-and-a-half miles of border without military patrol separates the border of the two countries from each other
 lekin iske baavjood ise duniya ke sabase khaufnak border ke taur par janaa jaataa he

 prakhyat patrkaar or lekhak em je akbar ne ravivaar ko kaha ki desh ke musalaamanon ko suraksha kaa bhay dikhaane waalon ko nahin balki unke vikaas kii baat karne waalon ke paksh main apana mat dena chahie
 Expressing his views on the topic 'economic Development and Deprivation' of the Shah Mushtaq Ahmed Smriti Lecture Series organized at Bihar Industries Association Hall in Patna, Akbar said that the Muslims of the country should not talk about their development but fear of security
 Should vote in favor of those akbar ne kaha ki desh kii aazaadee main bad-chadhakar hissaa lene vaale or rashtrawaad kii bhaavana se ot-prot musalmaan aazaadee ke purv swayan ko desh main alpsankhyak mahasoos nahin karte the par varsh 1935 main kisi muslim netaa dwaara islam khatre main he kaa naaraa diye jane ke baad aisi sthiti utpann hui
 Akbar said that the minority does not have any relation with the population because if it were so, many other castes including Brahmins would be a minority
 unhone kaha ki desh par raaj karne vaala alpsankhyak nahin hota or musalamaanon ne is desh par lambey samay tak raaj kiya he tathaa desh kii aazaadee main na keval unhone bad-chadhakar hissaa liya balki hameshaa rashtrawaad se ot-prot rahe
 Akbar said that Muslim minorities happened when they were out of power in the country and especially in the year 1935 when a Muslim leader gave the slogan that Islam is in danger
 unhone kaha ki ek musalmaan khatre main ho saktaa he par islam kabhi nahin kyonki islam us samay bhi khatre main nahin rahaa jab paigambar hazrat sallaho alehe vasallam akele the
 Akbar said that this situation of Muslims in the country was due to losing confidence and they started living in the shadow of fear
 aaj ve apane vikaas ke naam par nahin balki juthi suraksha kaa bharosa dilaane waalon ke liye apana bahumoolya vot barbaad kar dete hai
 Attributing the Muslims of the country to their present condition, Akbar said that this community never thought about its condition itself
 unhone kaha ki musalamaanon ko apni santan chaahe vah betaa ho beti ke prati barte jane vaale bhedbhaav ko samaapt karnaa hoga, nahin to yah kaum kabhi bhi tarakkee nahin kar sakati
 Akbar said that history is witness that India has never been a poor country whether it is before or after independence, because no one ever attacks a poor country unless you have nothing to loot
 koun saat hajaar mile kii duuri tay karke yahaan pahonchega
 He said that if there was no wealth in India, no other country including the British would send troops here
 akbar ne kaha ki 1750 main duniya main jis kisi vastu kaa utpaadan hota usamen china puure vishwa main 32 pratishat utpaadan karne vaala desh tha jabaki bharat dwaara puure vishwa kaa 24 pratishat utpaadan kiya jaataa tha or china or bharat duniya ke sabase amir mulk the
 He told that at that time 5 percent of the world by Japan, 4 percent by France, 2 by Britain
 8 pratishat, rus dwaara do pratishat or america dwaara ek pratishat utpaadan kiya jaataa tha
 Akbar said that India has always been a rich country where poor people live
 unhone kaha ki angrejon ke aane ke purv desh main jab kisi ilaake main akaal pasta tha puure ilaake kii nakebandi kar di jaati thi taaki vahaan se anaaj vahaan se baahar nahin ja sake
 He said that during the famine at that time, kitchens were run by kings and Nawabs where food was served to poor people
 akbar ne kaha ki itnaa hi logon ko naaptul main kami karne vaale dukandaaron ke liye bhi sakht sajaa kaa praavdhaan tha
 He said that after the British rule in 24 Parganas in 1765, the country used to send the same amount of money during the famine to London as it used to send on normal days
 akbar ne kaha ki sawaal yah nahin he ki angrejon ne kya kiya balki sawaal yah he ki desh kii aazaadee ke saath saal biit jane ke baavjood desh vaasiyon ne garibi dur karne ke liye kya kiya
 He said that at present the economic growth rate of the country is increasing day by day but the effect of that development is not visible on the face of poor people in other provinces of the country including Bihar
 akbar ne bataaya ki pichley saal pradhanmantri karyaalay se jari aankde ke mutabik desh kii kareeb 80 assi pratishat aabaadi bilkul garibi rekha ke sameep he yaa neeche he
 Akbar said that the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi made an effort to provide reservation in the constitution for the upliftment of Dalits
 baad main pichde virgo ke utthan ke liye mandal ayog kii anushansaaon ko lagu kiya gaya
 He said that today when the Sachar Commission report which states the economic and educational status of Muslims is not right and talks about reservation for them on that basis, people oppose it
 yah bilkul galat he
 If they did not have to give reservation to bring the downtrodden people of the society forward, then why were the Dalits and the backward classes given to them in the former

 Martyr's Day: Let the nation remember Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru in such a way, the date of throwing a bomb in the Central Assembly, in which Bhagat Singh was sentenced to death, was fixed as March 24
 lekin is din ko angrejon ke us dar ke rup main bhi yaad kiya janaa chahie, jiske chalate in teenon ko 11 ghante pehle hi faansee de di gai thi
 The hanging of the three heroes spread like fire across the country
 jiske baad faansee ko lekar jis tarah se pradarshan or virodh jari tha usase angreji sarkaar dari hui thi
 As a result, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were quietly hanged a day before the due date

 On 23 March 1931, Bhagat Singh and his two companions Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged at around 7
33 pm

 When, where is' right now let's go ', when the officials of the jail informed Bhagat Singh that the time had come for his execution, he said-' Stay! First, meet one revolutionary second
 phir ek minute baad kitaab chat kii ore oochaal kar bole - 'thik he ab chalo'
 While hanging, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were singing with all the fun

 jila lailpur (ab pakistan main) ke gaanv baawali main krantikari bhagat singh kaa janm ek saamaanya parivaar main hua tha
 When Bhagat Singh began to understand that his freedom was limited to the boundary of the house, he felt sad
 wo baar-baar kaha karte the ki angrajon se aazaadee paane ke liye hamen maangane kii jagah ran karnaa hoga

 Tithi is a witness to the fact that whenever rulers in the world have become deaf, the sound of revolt has awakened them from sleep and toppled those who did not wake up
 sirf dhai saal ke andar misr kii awam ne desh kii sabase oonchi kursi par baithe shaks ko kuch aise jagaaya ki neend khuli, to salaakhon ke peeche jaakar
 The Tahrir Chowk in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, on which Egypt had painted a golden picture of its future, also fell in love with Muhammad Mursi's chair
 nateeja phir vahi, taharir chowk par ek baar phir hujum, taharir chowk par ek or andolan or vahi taharir chowk dhai saal ke andar duusari ek or takhtapalat kaa gavaah bana
 Just two and a half years ago, the rebellion of rebellion in this Egypt shocked the world
 is baghawat kii aandhi main husnee mubarak ke tees saal kaa samrajya tinke kii tarah bikhar gaya tha
 It seemed that everything was fine in Egypt, but in the last two and a half years, what happened that the person who had chosen to hand over the key to the rule of the country, started knocking in everyone's eyes overnight? The story of the coup in Egypt is as fluctuating as it is important, because this story tells what are the consequences of not listening to Awam in Jamhooriyat
 kehete hai itihaas apane-aap ko doharaata jarur he, lekin apane itihaas ke liye hi pahachaane janevaale misr kaa bagawati itihaas itani jaldi doharaaya jayega, yah kisi ne bhi nahin sochaa tha
 Morsi is removed from the presidency and the country's constitution is put on hold
 morsi ko bedakhal kiye jane ke baad misr ke chif justise adli manasur ko kaaryvahak raashtrapati niyukt kiya gaya he
 In fact, the Egyptian people and opposition parties had opened a front against Morsi for the last four days
 log lakhon kii taadaad main taharir chowk par jamaa hokar raashtrapati gaddi chodo ke naare laga rahe the
 When Morsi's demand for Avam was unaffected, the army took command against Mursi and gave him a 48-hour ultimatum to leave the chair, but Mursi refused to leave the chair, ignoring the Army's warning
 buudhvaar kii shaam jab sena ke ultimate kii miyaad khatm hui to sena ne kahiraa ke ahm thikaanon par deraa daalana sharu kiya
 Army tanks started appearing everywhere in the city
 hajaaron kii taadaad main sainik un thikaanon par najar aane lage jahaan mursi samarthak date the, tabhi yah saaf ho gaya tha ki sena ne takhtapalat kii taiyaari kar lee he or phir chand ghanton ke andar sena ne morsi ko hataae jane kaa elaan kar diya
 With the announcement of the army, a wave of happiness ran among the Mursi opponents at Tahrir Chowk
 darasal, dhai saal pehle taanaashaahee ke khilaaf sulag rahe misr ke logon ne tab pehali baar khuli hawa main saans lee thi, jab unke gusse kii aag main pigal kar 11 farvari 2011 ko hosni mubarak kaa kila dhah gaya tha
 After this, elections were held in the country for the first time and people handed over the keys of the rule to Mursi
 morsi par jimmedaari isliye bhi badi thi kyonki unhen taanaashaahee ke khol se baahar aae ek mulk ke armaanon ko sahi myne main puraa karnaa tha, lekin mursi the ki kursi ke hokar rah gaye
 The army evicted Mursi from the throne, but it was reassuring that the army did not take power into its own hands
 haalanki takhtapalat ke baad ab misr main ek baar phir siyaasi sankat gaharaa gaya he, lekin aisi khabaren aa rahi hai ki is sankat se ubarne ke liye sena ne rodmap taiyaar kiya he jiskaa elaan al ajahar ke shaikh karenge
 Al Azhar is considered to be Egypt's most prestigious Islamic institution
 ab dekhnaa yah hoga ki yah elaan kitni jald hota he or kitni jald misr main nai sarkaar ke gathan ke liye chunaav karwaane kaa faisla hota he
 Which is the biggest demand of the Egyptian people

 Will the new capital in Andhra Pradesh be built in Amravati or somewhere else? Jagan Mohan government, while in opposition to find an alternative to other places, Jagan had opposed building a capital in Amravati
 Capital can be made
 mantri or party ke netaaon kii bayaanbaji se iske sanket mil rahe hai
 In the previous TDP government, while Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu was shifting from Hyderabad to the state capital Amravati, Jagan Mohan Reddy was outspoken and opposed while in opposition

 The government is also considering the proposals of the Sivaramakrishnan Committee for the new capital
 iske liye vah baithken bhi bula rahe hai
 If CM Jagan decides to make the capital somewhere other than Amravati, Chandrababu Naidu will get a big shock
 amravati main nai rajdhani bananaa chandrababu naidu kaa dream project rahaa he
 During his tenure as the Chief Minister, Naidu used to say that he would make Amravati such a model capital that other states of the country would also take inspiration
 naidu ne tidipi sarkaar ke vakt amravati main rajdhani banane ke liye 33 hajaar acre jameen adhigrahit kii thi
 However, there has been opposition to the creation of capital in Amravati, which is included in the fertile areas
 naidu ke bulaane par varsh 2015 main pahunche pradhanmantri narendra modi ne amravati main nai rajdhani kii neenv rakhi thi
 It was said at that time that by 2024 the new capital would be fully formed
 bataa den ki andhra pradesh ke vibhaajan ke baad rajdhani hyderabad telugana ke khate main gai thi
 During the partition it was decided that the Andhra Pradesh government could use Hyderabad as the capital until the new capital was created
 mantri ne kaha-baadh main dub jaataa he amravatidarasal, haal main andhra pradesh ke shahari vikaas mantri botsa satyanarayan ne kaha tha ki krishna nadi kaa kshetra badhgrast he, lihaaja amravati ko rajdhani banane ke faisle par punarvichaar karne kii jarurarat he
 Because there is flood here
 amravati main baandh aadi banane kii jarurat he
 He also talked about the high cost of building the capital in Amravati
 kaha ki agar duusare sthanon par rajdhani ke nirmaan ke liye ek lakh rupee lagata he to amravati main do lakh kharch karne padate hai
 Following the minister's statement, there has been speculation in the state that the Jagan government may shift the capital elsewhere
 bijepi ne kaha- rajdhani par jagan spasht karen rukhandhra pradesh main nai rajdhani ko lekar jari asamanjas ke beej bijepi ne is par jagan mohan reddy sarkaar se rukh spasht karne kii maang kii he
 The BJP says that under the Naidu government, more than nine thousand crores were spent on the construction of a new capital in Amravati
 aise main hyderabad ke amravati or phir amravati se kahin or rajdhani shift karne se janata kii dhanrashi kaa durupyog hoga
 bjp's Rajya Sabha MP and spokesperson GVM Narasimha Rao says the Jagan Mohan government should clarify whether it wants to advance Amravati as the state capital or has an alternative plan
 saansad bole- chaar rajdhani banane kii taiyaaribhajapa ke rajyasabha saansad tiji venkatesh ne haal main daawa kiya tha ki jagan mohan reddy rajya main chaar rajdhani bananaa chaahate hai
 He has also shared this plan with the top BJP leadership in Delhi
 rajyasabha saansad venkatesh ne jagan mohan ke is plan kaa samarthan bhi kiya
 It said that this would lead to equal development of all areas of the state
 rajyasabha saansad ne daawa kiya ki mukhyamantri jagan vijayangaram, kakinada, guntur or kadpa shahar main rajdhani bananaa chaahate hai
 Kangana Ranaut and Alia Bhatt are not taking the name of the long-running feud with the release of the film Manikarnika
 ek taraf aalia bhatta jahaan kangana ke bayanon kaa shaleenta se jawaab de rahi hai
 At the same time Kangana Ranaut is not leaving any chance to target Alia
 ab ek baar phir kangana ranut ne aalia par hamalaa kiya he
 Kangana has reacted to the acting done in Alia's Gully Boy
 ye vivaad bollywood life ke online pole se shuru hua
 Where Kangana Ranaut defeated Alia Bhatt in the survey of Best Actress of 2019
 voting main kangana pehle or aalia duusare number par raheen
 In a conversation with the website, Kangana said, "I am embarrassed
" gali boy kii parformens main mujhe haraane jaisaa kya tha
 The same blunt girl role again
 
 
 mahila shashaktikaran or achche abhinay ke bare main bollywood kaa vichaar
 
 
 Keep me out of this embarrassment
 media ne filmi bacchon ko bahut pyaar se liya he
 Stop pampering them for their average work, otherwise the scale of good acting will never rise
 ''isse pehle kangana ne mid de ko die intervyuu main aalia-ranbir ko is janareshan kaa yuva cheharaa bataae jane kii aalochana kii thi
 Kangana Ranaut had said- "what is the matter of calling them young
 ranbir kapur 37 saal ke hai
 Alia Bhatt is just 27 years old
 27 saal kii umr main meri maa ke teen bachche the
 This is absolutely unfair
 bachche hai ki damb hai
 "let's tell, Kangana is still upset with the film Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi not getting Bollywood support
" lagata he is babat kangana ranut sabase zyada gussa aalia se hai
 Kangana had said- "alia had sent me the trailer of Raji and told to watch the film
 trailor dekhne ke baad maine meghna gulzaar or aalia ko phone kiya tha
 But there was no response from anyone for my film
 '' In 2008, Rimjhim and Anjali's mother, who escaped from Amitabh Bachchan, did not come forward again, but when the two sisters once again made news headlines, the father, who was still anonymous, went to meet the two sisters in the same school, where the last 7 These girls have been growing for years
 lekin in bahanon ne apane pita ko pahchaanane se yah kehete hue inkaar kar diya ki agar saath gaye to ye hamen bech denge
 Rimjhim and Anjali's father Ashok Pandey and aunt Anita Pandey arrived at Shantin Niketan, a small school on Jagat Narayan Road in Patna, to take these two sisters back home
 lekin jis parivaar kii berukhi kii vajah se ye donon bahanen aaj anathon kii tarah pal rahi thi,uske saath inhone naa sirf jane se inkaar kiya balkiapane pita ko pahchaananetak se inkaar kar diya
 When Ashok was asked why no one had taken care of these girls yet, he replied, after much chuckling, 'I was sick
 ' phir uske baad kaha ki mujhe pataa hi nahin tha ki meri bacchiyaan kahaan hai or jab inaki tasveeron ko akhabaaron main dekha to ham inhen lene aae hai
 Anjali and Rimjhim's aunt, who had brought up the two sisters in childhood, met these girls today and brought a photo for identification with them, but Rimjhim and Anjali refused to identify the aunt either
 anitha ke mutabik in bacchiyon kii maa ne inhen bachapan main hi chhod diya tha or amitabh bachchan se paise lekar faraar ho gai
 Now that both girls are growing up, if their mother sells them, then the family's reputation will be lost
 vahiin duusari ore rimjhim or anjali ghar nahin janaa nahin chaahati
 Anjali says that she did not even come to ask us for so many years
 ham yahaan jaise pal rahe hai, vaise hi thik hai jabaki rimjhim kahati he ki yadi ham inke saath gayi to ye log hamen bech denge
 However, both the girls did not go with their family
 in donon ko ye dar sata rahaa he ki pehle unki maa ne unke naam par paise liye or ab itane saalon ke baad pita ko inaki yaad keval laalach kii vajah se ai he
 On the festival of Mauni Amavasya, lakhs of people took a dip of faith and reverence in rivers across the country today
 elahabaad ke sangam tat par subah se hi log snaan kar daan punya karne lage hai
 At the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and the invisible Saraswati, it is believed that Lord Vishnu, the foster of creation, exists in the form of a child i
e
 Benimadhava and will create the structure of the creation from here
 to aise sangam tat par magh maas main mauni amavasya ke din maun rahakar snaan daan karne se akshay punya kii prapti hoti he or isi punya kii prapti ke liye deshbhar se aae shraddhalu sangam par aasthaa or vishwaas kii dubkee laga rahe hai
 It is believed that on this day, keeping silence and taking a bath in the Ganges and donating it, one gets salvation along with renewable virtue
 yah bhi kehete hai ki aaj hi ke din amrit kii boond bhi prithvi par giri thim
 So taking a bath in the Ganges on this day gives a lot of merit
 varanasi ke dashashwamegh ghat par isi moksh kii lekar log subah se snaan kar rahe hai
 After Makar Sankranti, the sun becomes Uttarayan and on this day, when the full Uttarayan sun fills all its energy in the people, then the flow of Ganga flowing northwards in Kashi gives aeon to the devotees
 yahi vajah he ki mauni amavasya ke maukey par log snaan daan kar rahe hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party has lately started opening its cards
 party ke supremeo arvind kejariwal janata ke sawaalon ke jawaab dete-dete thak se gaye hai
 The questions are on all the promises which have not been fulfilled and which they said that they will be fulfilled in a few days after the party comes to power
 unki samasya yah thi ki ye vaade aise nahin the ki ve hafte yaa das dinon main puure kar den jabaki unhone utsaah ke atirek main janata ke saamne unhen rakh diya
 Facing criticisms, now he had come to the point that he had to show something big
 aisa kuch bada jisase janata main acha sandesh jaae or vah shahid hone kii sthiti aa jaaen
 He has already given orders for investigation of 1984 riots, now he has attacked Sheila Dixit
 unhone chunaav ke pehle elaan kiya tha ki bhrashtachar ke aarope main vah shila dikshit ko jail kii hawa khilaaenge
 Now he has sent the corruption file in the Commonwealth Games to the Anti Corruption Bureau
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki ab purv siem par exiaar darj hogi
 The child of Delhi knows that there was a lot of corruption in the Commonwealth Games and officers and leaders looted a lot
 lekin fanse to sirf kalmadi
 The CM of Delhi, other leaders and officers escaped unscathed
 un par ungliyaan to uthin lekin koi karrwai nahin hui
 Now Kejriwal has played a great bet
 unhen pataa he ki is mudde par unki sarkaar gir sakati he
 Congress could hardly bear this injury
 shila dikshit alaakaman kii sabase priy netaaon main rahi hai or hameshaa hi unhen vahaan sharan mili he
 He had intimate relations with Sonia Gandhi and this was the reason that whenever a wave of discontent arose in the Delhi Congress, it was suppressed
 beshak congress ke netaa kuch bhi kahen, siem kejariwal kaa yah waar aisa he ki party ko koi bada kadam uthaanaa hi hoga or yahi vah chaahate hai
 Every major step of the Congress will make the Aam Aadmi Party popular
 ho saktaa he baat samarthan waapas lene tak chali jaae
 This will be good for the future of the Aam Aadmi Party as in the subsequent elections he can say that his honest government has been dropped by "dishonest"
 yah agle chunaav or loksabhaa chunaav main unke liye badhiya astr ban saktaa he
 The downfall of the government by the Congress is in the interest of the party
 iske baad vah shahidi mudra main khadey ho sakate hai
 The year 2016 will be remembered as the golden year of Indian Test cricket
 is saal bhartiya team kii safalataa or cricketron ke parakram ne team or khilaadiyon ko isisi kii ranking main number ek banaakar aane vaale varshon main vishwa cricket main is team kii bulandiyon kii patakatha likh di he
 In the next year i
e
 2017, Indian cricket will continue to speak and all the players will contribute in this effort, but these are the five such cricketers who will have the limelight at the international and national level
 is paanch sitara team kii kaman bhi is vakt vishwa ke sabase charchit cricketer viraat kohli ke haathon main hoga or saath honge is vakt duniya ke number ek olerounder ravichandran aswin to gendbaaji kii ranking main tisare sthaan par kabiz ravindra jadeja yahaan bhi unka saath nibhaayenge
 Apart from these three names, there are many big names who will write history with their cricketing skills in 2017, but Karun Nair, who scored a triple century in Mumbai, and who broke the record for the biggest score as the opener was not out from the beginning to the end of the innings
 Samith Gohel will be its other two members
 viraat kohlitim india ke test captain or vartmaan team main sarvaadhik ran banane vaale viraat kohli ek baar phir 2017 main apana varchasv bananaa jari rakhenge
 Virat contributed to every team win in the 2016 calendar year
 test cricket main 75
 With an average of 94 and four centuries, scored 1215 runs, three centuries in 10 odis and 648 runs at an average of 81
 92 kii ausat se 15 antarrashtriya tii20 maichon main 642 ran ke saath hi ipel main 87
 Average of 18 and 153
 93 ke strike rate ke saath 959 ran, isamen chaar shatak shaamil
 This is Virat's consistent bat performance in 2016, so even though he could not get his Bangalore team the IPL as captain, he made Team India the best in Tests
 dhoni ke baad duusari baar team india test cricket main top ranking team bani or lagaataar 18 test maichon main aparajit bhi
 The year 2017 also starts with ODI cricket
 fark itnaa he ki team india apni dharti par angrejon se loha legi jabaki pichley saal wo kangaaroon se unheen kii dharti par 1-4 se haare the
 After this, Virat has to compete in a Test with Bangladesh and then with the Kangaroos in India
 cricket australia ne viraat ko apni vishwa ekadash kaa captain niyukt kiya he or us team main apni team ke captain steve smith ko rakhaa he to itnaa to tay he ki wo smith ke mukaable viraat ko behatar captain maanate hai
 One of the two Test matches that Virat has lost under his captaincy was against Australia and his feud with Steve Smith is well known
 yani jab kangaaroo bharat aaenge to viraat na keval bataur ballebaaj balki ek captain ke rup main bhi apana jalawaa bikheregein yah sau fisadi sambhavit he
 Ravichandran Ashwin 30-year-old Ravichandran Ashwin scored 43 in 12 Tests this year
 71 kii ausat se 612 ran banaae to 12 test main 23
 Took 72 wickets more than any bowler in the world at an average of 90
 unhone lagaataar duusare saal ek calendar varsh main sarvaadhik wicket lene kaa karnama kiya he
 His wickets have reached 248 in only 44 Tests and he is set to become the fastest Indian bowler to take 250 wickets in 2017
 2016 main wo keval do vanade match khel sake lekin tii20 main sarvaadhik wicket lene ke maamle main wo (17 match main 23 wicket lekar) saal 2016 main duusare sthaan par rahe
 Captain Virat Kohli's contribution in India's victory is no less than that of Ravichandran Ashwin
 2017 main bhartiya team kii safalataa bahut had tak aswin kii safalataa par bhi nirbhar he
 The credit for Ravindra Jadejatim India's success on their home turf in 2016 goes to captain Kohli and Firki's fancier Ashwin, along with Ravindra Jadeja who scored 24 this year
 56 kii ausat se 43 wicket liye or bharat ke svarnim phiraki yug kii yaad dilaa di
 Jadeja wiped out half the English team in the Mumbai Test and not only established himself as Ashwin's partner but also moved up to second place in the ICC rankings
 saal 2017 main bharat ko apni hi dharti par shuruaati paanch test khilne hai or jadeja kaa safal hona team india kii safalataa ke liye utana hi jaruri he jitna aswin kaa
 Along with this, his performance in domestic cricket will also be monitored as he has managed to win his team with 10 wickets in the final of the 2015 Duleep Trophy Denite tournament
 karun nairgharelu str par karnataka kii team ke liye khilne vaale karun nair ne chennai test main apane kariyar ke pehle shatak ke taur par tihara shatak (naabad 303) lagane vaale pehle bhartiya banane kaa record banaaya he
 He is also the first batsman in the world to score a triple century in just the third Test innings of his career
 nair pratham shrenee maichon main bhi 55
 Has scored 3191 runs with an average of 01 and with the help of nine centuries
 2015 ke march main ye karun hi the jinhone ranjai trophy ke final main tihara shatak lagaakar 68 saal purana record todaa tha
 Karun has played in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for Royal Challengers Bangalore, Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Daredevils
 is saal unhen chaar karod rupee main kharida gaya or dilli dairedevills ke liye khelte hue unhone bakhubi apni keemat adaa kii or mahatvapurn ran jode
 Samit Bhanubhai Gohel 26 year old Samit Bhanubhai Gohel of Gujarat started his first-class cricket career with a half-century
 is saal naabad tihara shatak (359) jadne se pehle wo uttar pradesh (60 or 50), madhya pradesh (34, 104) or mumbai (87, 18) ke khilaaf ranjai main acchhee pari khel chuke the
 During this memorable innings played against Odisha in Jaipur, Gohel scored the second highest score (after Sir Don Bradman) of the second innings of first-class cricket
 yah ranjai trophy kii duusari pari main vijay hajaare (309) or cheteshwar pujaara (352) ke baad keval teesraa sabase bada to bibi nimbalkar (naabad 443), sanjay manjrekar (377), emvi shridhar (366) ke baad overol (vijay marchent ke saath sanyukt rup se) chauthaa sabase bada score bhi he
 Gohel's entry into the Indian team is still dependent on his bat performance in the first class in 2017
 haa tihare shatak ke pradarshan se viraat kohli, anil kumble, rahul dravid or saurav ganguli sareekhe diggajon kii us par najar jarur tik jarur gai he
 There are many names and it is not that only these five players of Indian cricket are expected to perform
 team kaa prayek sadsy kisi bhi match or pari ke dauraan apane pradarshan se kabhi bhi chamatkrit kar saktaa he kyonki is team main ek se badhkar ek nayab khilaadi hai
 Take Jaspreet Bumrah and Lokesh Rahul as an example
 bumraah kii ab tak test cricket main entry nahin ho saki he lekin vanade main 17 wicket or tii20 main to wo saal 2016 ke sarvaadhik wicket (28) lene vaale gendbaaj rahe
 On the other hand, Lokesh Rahul has announced the birth of a new star on the big stage of cricket by putting an international century in all three formats of cricket
 jis chennai test main karun nair ne tihara shatak jadaa usamen rahul ne bhi shatak jamaaya or apane karnataka team ke saathi ke saath chauthe wicket ke liye 161 ranon kii saajhedaari bhi kii
 India also has to play the Champions Trophy in June of 2017, so this format will be watched by everyone against England in January
 yahaan ek baat bataanaa or bhi jaruri he ki karun nair or jayant yadav jaise khilaadi jo aaj rashtriya team main khel rahe hai unke rashtriya str tak pahunchane main under 19 team ke coach rahul dravid kaa bhi khaasaa yogadan he
 In 2017, what the trio of Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble and Virat Kohli will feed, it will tell the time to come
 philhal yah kahana mushkil nahin he ki bhartiya cricket kaa bhavishya surakshit haathon main he

 Many predictions of France's Nostradamus have been proved correct
 unamem se hi kuch yah hai
 
 1
 Narendra Modi will change the picture of India
 Nostradamus had predicted that a powerful leader will come in India who will change the picture of India, India will emerge as a superpower under his leadership
 unki is bhavishyavaanee ko narendra modi se joda gaya
 2
 world trade centre par hamalanastredamas ne apni bhavishyavaanee main kaha tha ki do badi aapas mentakaraayengi jisase yuki sthiti paidaa hogi
 And the sky will become a region of terror
 nastredamas kii is bhavishyavaanee ko 2001 main hue world trade centre par hamale se joda gaya tha
 3
 hitler kaa udaynastredamas nedusre vishwayudhke bare main bhavishyavaanee kii thi
 In which it was said that a child will come into this world, which will cause many lives in the war
 4
 Fire prediction in London: Nostradamus had predicted a major fire in London
 jiske baad 1966 main landan main kaaphi bhayankar aag lagi thi
 Due to this fire, the city of London was under fire for three days
 5
 The Nuclear bombing prediction of the nuclear attacks in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan proved to be absolutely correct
 nastredamas ne kaha tha ki do aise dhamaake honge jiskaa asar kaaphi lambey samay tak rahegaa
 Cricket is seen as a sport in our country that its best player (sachin) has the status of God within the country
 kisi ko yahaan dada kaha jaataa he to kisi ko mistar wal
 Standing someone's collar becomes fashionable, so even today people remember how to twist someone's wrist
 aaj kii team dekhen to kabhi bhartiya team ke mistar wal kahe jane vaale rahul dravid kii jagah par cheteshwar pujaara badi safai se apni jagah bana chuke hai
 His batting gives people a glimpse of Rahul Dravid
 ve bhi pich par khunta gaad kar thik usee tarah jude rahete hai jis tarah kabhi rahul the
 In such a situation, an ordinary person and especially students can learn a lot from them
 jaane unka saxes formula
 
 
 1
 sthirataa
 
 
 Consistency is called consistency in English
 pujaara apni team ke liye hameshaa hi aise parformar rahe hai
 They always play in team interest
 unki acchhee parformens aksar team ko jeet dilaane main madad karti he
 2
 sambhaav rahanaa
 
 
 No matter how tense the situation is
 vipakshi team bhale hi haaavee dikh rahi ho lekin ve hameshaa apane game par focus karte dikhte hai
 They are always trying to be self-sufficient for the team on their own
 3
 Always keep an eye on the future
 
 
 cheteshwar ko jaanane vaale jaanate hai ki ve hameshaa se hi aage kii ranneeti bana kar khelte hai
 Whether they are playing in any one match, they always think ahead
 4
 Keeping connected with your roots
 
 
 cheteshwar aaj bhale hi bhartiya cricket team ke abhinn hisse hon or puri duniya unhen sarankhon par rakhti ho lekin ve aaj bhi apane shahar pahunchane par apane puraane practice ground jate hai
 They consider it their duty to give the necessary tips to their seniors cricketers to keep moving forward
 5
 To adapt yourself to every situation
 
 
 cheteshwar hameshaa timman rahe hai
 It is not that he has always been an opener for India but he has always been playing the roles decided by the captain and management of the team honestly

 gauratlab he ki jab shaheedon kaa parthiv sharir patna airport par pahunchaa or unhen shradhanjali di ja rahi thi usee vakt nitish kumaar airport se saath lagi hui path bihar rajya path vikaas praadhikaran ke daftar main praadhikaran kaa aathvaan sthapana diwas kaarykram main shirkat kar rahe the
 Questions are arising, after all, the Chief Minister did not even get enough time to pay tribute to the martyrs by going to Patna Airport located at Chand Kadam
 If this was not enough, then hear what happened next
 shaheedon ke parthiv sharir ko unke paitruk gaanv pahunchane ke liye alag-alag gadiyon main chadhaaya gaya or jaise hi yah gaadiyaan patna airport se baahar aane hi vaali thi ki unhen roak diya gaya
 The reason was that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's program had ended and he was leaving the venue and going to his house
 mukhya mantri kaa kafila patna airport ke saamne se guzar rahaa tha or isi vajah se shaheedon kii gadiyon ko airport ke andar hi kuch minute ke liye roak diya gaya
 The manner in which the Sukma martyrs were treated at Patna Airport for some time is causing a lot of disgrace to the Bihar government

 pichhali baar ke champion spain ke vishwa cap ke pehle daur main baahar hone se hataash uske khilaadiyon ne apni khunnas mediakarmiyon par dikhaani shuru kar di he lekin tab sabhi hadein paar ho gai jab phul back jordi alba ek patrkaar se bhid gaye or unhen ‘sir kalam karne kii’ kii dhamkee de daali
 According to 'the Guardian' the incident took place after Spain's 3-0 win over Australia at Arena da Baxada
 vahaan ‘mixd jone’ main patrkaar khilaadiyon se baat karne ke liye ekatrit the
 Then Alba 'edge' reporter Javier Gomez passed close to Matalanas and he said, 'next time i will behead you
 ’matalanes ne jab is par hairaani jataai to alba ne phir doharaaya, ‘haa, haa agali baar main
 i warn you ’ iske baad hawaii adde par bhi isi tarah kii dhamkee patrkaar ko di gai
 Matalanas however does not know why Alba is angry with him
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe kuch yaad nahin ki maine kabhi uske bare main kuch likhaa tha
 ' agar ye sawaal poocha jaae ki chilchilaati garmi main sabase zyada sukun dene vaali cheez koun si he to bahut se logon kaa jawaab shaayad ek hi hoga- icecream
 But if someone says that you have got pig fat in your ice cream, then will you be able to eat your favorite thing? Forget about vegetarian people, after this most people will think a hundred times before eating ice cream
 isi judaa jab ek massej viral hone laga, jisamen icecream main boar kii charbi hone kii baat kahi ja rahi he to hamane iskaa viral test karne kaa faisla kiya
 Look at this photo carefully before knowing further details
 is massej ke mutabik daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki amul kii pista malai vaali is kulfi main boar kii charbi mili he
 Two substances, named E-407 and E-412, are claimed to contain pig fat by placing the ice cream pack
 amul ke packet par chhapi jaankaree ke mutabik ye donon chijen stablizars ke taur par istemaal kii gayi hai
 If you take a picture of any ice cream packet on Google, not only Amul, then you will find that stabilizers are used in almost every ice cream
 stablizars kya hote hai or inkaa istemaal kyon kiya jaataa he ye jaanane ke liye hamane gujarat ke anand main amul ke factory ke clality control vibhaag se sampark kiya
 From there it was found that stabilizers meant substances that prevent ice crystals from forming in the ice cream, soften it and prevent it from melting rapidly as the coolant subsides
 lekin asli chunauti is baat kii sachai kaa pataa lagaana tha ki kya E-407 or E-412 naam ke padaarthon main vaaki boar kii charbi mili he?iskaa pataa lagane ke liye hamane bharat sarkaar ke santhaan FSSAI yani bhartiya khaagh sangraksha evam maanak praadhikaran main sampark kiya
 FSSAI does the work of checking the quality of everything food and drink used in India
 FSSAI ke adwiser sunil bakshi ne hamen bataaya ki khaane pine kii chizon main e kaa matlab hota he ki in padaarthon ko european iconomic community (EEC) ne khaane pine kii chizon main milaane kii anumati di hui he
 There is a complete list of such substances
 har number se ye saaf hota he ki wo kya padaarth he
 Bakshi reported that E-407 is carrageenan which is made from the red algae (algae) that grow in the sea
 iskaa sabase zyada utpaadan philippines main hota he
 Similarly E-412 means guar gum which is derived from a pod and is made into powder by grinding seeds of guar gum like lentils
 iskaa bahut badi maatra main utpaadan bharat main bhi hota or yahaan se kai deshon ko niryaat bhi kiya jaataa he
 Sunil Bakshi said that there is no doubt that both these things originate from plants and hence are completely vegetarian
 unhone bataaya ki puri duniya main icecream banane main iskaa khub istemaal hota he
 We also asked Amul's MDRS Sodhi if there is any truth about Amul's ice cream being a non-vegetarian substance
 Sodhi said that only and only vegetarian foods are used in every food item of Amul
 jin padaarthon ke bare main juthi afvaah failaai ja rahi he wo bhi plant product hai isliye puri tarah shaakaahaari hai
 Halalcertifiering a Sweden website
 sena sirf sabhi khaane pine kii chizon main milaae jane vaale adtives ke bare main vistaar se jaankaree detii he balki is baat ko bhi saaf karti he ki ye chijen islam dharm ke hisaab se khaane yogya hai yaa nahin
 Even after visiting this website, when we checked, it was found that E-407 and E-412 are not only in the list of vegetarian substances, but it is clearly written that they are also halal according to Islam
 matlab saaf he ki hamaare viral test main amul icecream main boar ke charbi mili hone kii baat puri tarah galat sabit hui

 aparaadh shakha ke adhikariyon ko mukhabiron se mili is khabar ne, ki anchal ke kisaan saadhaaran kheti kii aad main nashe kii kheti kar rahe hai, ekbargi unhen bhi chaunkaa diya
 Then started the strike of such farmers
 nateezaah police ko das maah main ganje kii avaidh kheti ke dedh darjan se zyada prakaran mili
 The recent case of May 14 is that of Barseria village in Bhind district
 yahaan ke kisaan purushottam kushavaah ke khet main ganje ke paanch sau se zyada paudhe mili hai
 He hid these plants among marigold plants
 ek din baad hi dabra main vishnu shroti naam ke kisaan ke khet se ganje ke 100 se zyada paudhe mili, jisane inhen ek ore oonchi diwaar banaakar or duusari ore se ganna ke paudhe lagaakar chipa rakhaa tha
 Apart from cannabis plants, about 25 kg of dry hemp has also been recovered from Sroti
 9 may ko shahar se sate gaanv tighara main bhi aparaadh shakha ko paanch hectare ke khet main ganje ke paudhe lahalhate hue mili the
 Farmers named Bhagirath and Rajendra Kushwaha planted hemp plants among the flowers in their fields
 yahaan ganje ke 15,000 hajaar paudhe lage hue the, jinase chand maheenon main hi unhen teen quintal ganja miltaa
 Earlier in Shivpuri, Morena and Seora village of Datia, a large number of cannabis plants were also recovered from several farms, which were destroyed on the spot by the police

 Gives the benefit of mahaj ek kilo ganja kii evaj main kisaanon ko 3,000 ru
 See you yani agar kisaan khet main ganje ke sirf sau paudhe bhi laga letaa he to salbhar main acchhee-khaasi kamai kar letaa he
 Obviously, when one is getting more profit by less effort then why should anyone plant mustard, wheat or gram crops
 ganje kii avaidh kheti kaa bhandaphod karne vaale aparaadh shakha ke atirikt police adheekshak amit sanghi bataate hai ki ganje ke in 40,000 se zyada paudhon se 1,000 quintal se zyada ganje kaa utpaadan ho saktaa tha

 Will be, while the same money will be made in lakhs on applying hemp
 ganje ke ek paudhe se, jo ki chah maah main taiyaar ho jaataa he or jisase chaar se chah kilo ganja nikaala ja saktaa he, kareeb 20,000 ru

 ) Pakistan has once again denied any evidence related to the Mumbai attacks
 pakistan ke videsh sachiv salmaan bashir ne kaha heki bharat ne mumbai hamalon se jude saboot uplabdh nahin karaae hai
 He said that the evidence India has given is insufficient
 ek din pehle hi bharat ne pakistan ko mumbai hamalon se jude saboot saunpe hai or is ek din main pakistan kii taraf se do tarah ke bayaan aa rahe hai
 The situation has become worse with what Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said about terrorism
 ye kahana he pakistan ke videsh sachiv salmaan bashir kaa
 It is worth mentioning that Manmohan Singh took a dig at the Chief Ministers meeting held in the capital to discuss the issue of internal security and said that Pakistan is a country sponsoring terrorism and it is creating war
 salmaan bashir ne kaha he ki bharat kii taraf se aa rahe aise bayaan se kshetra main yuddh ke halaat ban sakate hai
 In this news quoting 'don', it has also been said that whatever evidence India has given to the Mumbai attack to Pakistan is insufficient
 pakistan ke ek akhbaar 'da nesan' ne sutron ke hawaale se jo khabar chhapi he wo pakistan kii niyat par kai sawaal khadey karti he
 According to the newspaper, the evidence related to the Mumbai attack that has been handed over to Pakistan is insufficient for any action
 pakistan ne ye baat america ke dakshin or madhya asia maamalon kii sahaayak videsh mantri richard vauchar se kahi he
 Pakistan has said that Kasab's statement cannot be considered evidence as these statements can also be forcefully thrown out
 bharat se mili sabooton kii jaanch ke liye pakistan sarkaar ne alag - alag jaanch agenciyon kii ek cameti banaai he
 These committee will prepare the report after examining the evidence

 To understand what is grand, sparkling or high speed dilemma, take a trip to the Bhimkai Dam and nuclear power house, sitting in the bullet train
 ye teenon hi buniyadi dhaancha vansh kii kaamyaab lekin vivaadit santaanen hai
 The comparison of the bullet train to the metro is inconsistent
 nagareey va upnagareey rail parivahan kii teen peedhishaan (tram—mumbai local—dilli ring railway—kolkata metro) bharat main pehle se hai
 Delhi's Metro is their new version
 haalanki metro raajnneeti par savaar hokar aise shaharon main bhi pahunch gai jahaan isaki aarthik safalataa sandigdh he
 Bullet trains are a letter of confusion for the policy of inland transport in India
 yah asamanjas raftaar or vistaar ke bich samanvay kaa he
 Europe's aviation industry too (1970 to 2003) brought in supersonic Concorde airlines in a mad rush
 san 2000 kii july main airfrance kii kancord durghatana ke baad yah seva band hui or vimaanan udyog ne ek nai karavat lee
 Now the competition was not of speed, but of expansion
 nae shaharon ke liye sasti udaanen shuru huin
 The size of the aircraft (airbus 380) was increased
 vistaar va sasti seva se yatri bade or aviation udyog ko safalataa ke supersonic pankh lag gaye
 It is important to look at India's bullet trains in the context of international uses of inland transport: there are no bullet trains in the US
 bhugolic vishalata ke kaaran railway ko maal parihavan par kendrit yatriyon ke liye nijee vaahanon or vimaan seva ko variyata di gai
 Hence the automobile and aviation industry developed
 europea deshon ne chote bhugol ke mutabik railway (kuch deshon main haai speed rail bhi) ko yatri or sadakon ko maal parivahan kaa jariya banaaya, haalanki sasti vimaan seveen antareuropea yatraaon main railway ke liye chunauti hai
 The extremely densely populated small Japan (with only 20 per cent of geography habitable) was further shortened by 'shikansen' (the basis of India's bullet train)
 japani bullate train aam logon ke liye khaasi mahangi he
 Employees move to major cities via Shinkansen at the expense of their companies
 japan kii vimaan sevaayen, bazaar ke liye bullate train se lard raheen hai
 China has built the world's largest high-speed train network (at a 40 per cent lower cost than the world) in the last two decades, but the bullet trains have melted the profits of all three government airlines
 bullate train apni laagat laabh (cost benifit) asangati ko lekar khaasi vivaadit hai
 The governments of China and Japan are free to take private land, and also give huge subsidies to the project
 europe main mahangi jameen ke kaaran haai speed rail kii laagat oonchi he
 High-speed rail projects in the US of Los angeles-san Francisco and dallas-houston are pending due to land acquisition conflicts and cost overruns
 ham bullate train ko chunavi shosha nahin balki ek gambhir pariyojna maanate hai jo antardeshiy parivahan niti or railway ke punargathan kaa sandesh honi chahie
 1
 maal parivahan ke kaarobaar main railway, sadak se haar chuki he
 Transportation of railways is limited to coal, iron and cement
 railway kaa kaarobaar ab yatri parivahan se hi chalegaa
 Dedicated freight (freight) corridors should be converted into long distance high speed passenger transport corridors while the old network should be used for freight transport
 railway ko yatri parivahan ke nae rajasav model kii jarurat he jise nijee bhagidaari ke saath viksit kiya ja saktaa he
 2
 pichley dashakon main sadakon par railway se zyada nivesh hua he
 Now there is a need to build high speed freight corridors so that big trucks can travel long distances without stopping
 phayda automobile udyog ko hoga
 3
 bharat main nagaron kii bahutayat he
 Transport to shorter distances can be focused on better roads and private vehicles
 4
 Cheap airlines and long-distance high-speed trains can modernize inland transportation
 railway ke saamaajik or vanijyik dayitvon ko alag karnaa hoga
 Social obligations should get funding from the budget
 bullate train ke saath bharat kii antardeshiy parivahan niti badalanaa jaruri he
 Otherwise, if this expensive (two and a half times the annual budget of the railway) project is built out of debt from Japan, then it will become high speed palace on wheels for tourists
 aam rail yatriyon kii jindagi main isse koi fark nahin padegaa
 Bullet trains are a letter of confusion for the policy of inland transport in India

 Hadiya was freed by the Supreme Court under the tutelage of parents to complete homeopathy
 saath hi supreme court ne hadiya ko tamilnadu ke salem bhejne kaa aadesh de diya, taaki vah padhai puri kar sake
 The Supreme Court has directed the Kerala Police to provide security to Hadiya and ensure that she reaches Salem as soon as possible
 supreme court ke aadesh ke baad hadiya apane college jaaegi or apni padhai puri karegi
 Earlier, Hadiya said in court that she did not want anyone to become her local guardian

 Alok Verma has been reinstated as the director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
 desh kii sabase badi jaanch agency kendriya jaanch beuro (CBI) main kaaphi samay se chal rahe vivaad par supreme court ne centre sarkaar ko tagada jhatka diya he
 The court overturned the cvc's decision, canceling the decision to send Alok Verma on leave
 iske saath hi ab 76 din baad alok verma phir sibiai ke chif ban gaye hai
 Significantly, on October 23 last year, CVC and dopt issued three orders as overnight rapid fire action
 alok verma or rakesh asthana ko chuttee par bhejne ke saath sibiai ke sanyukt nideshak em
 Nageswara Rao was appointed as the interim director
 chuttee par bheje gaye sibiai nideshak alok kumaar verma ne centre sarkaar ke faisle ke khilaaf supreme court main yachika daayar kii thi
 After the fight between CBI Director Alok Kumar Verma and Bureau Special Director Rakesh Asthana became public, the Central Government decided to deprive the two officers of their rights and send them on leave
 donon adhikariyon ne ek duusare par bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaae the
 Alok Verma said in his petition that the three orders by CVC and dopt are arbitrary and illegal, they should be quashed
 yachika main alok verma ne tha, 'sivisi, centre ne mujhe sibiai nideshak kii bhoomika se hataane ke liye raturaat nirnay' liya
 This decision is contrary to Section 4B of the DSPE Act which provides a safe period of two years to the CBI chief to ensure the independence of the agency
 verma ne kaha he ki adhinium ke tahat PM, lop or CJI ke ucchstareey panel dwaara sibiai nideshak kii niyukti jaruri he to usee tarah sibiai nideshak ko sthanantarit karne ke liye is samiti kii sahmati aavashyak he
 This case has been decided out of law
 sunwaayee ke dauraan sijeai ke sawaalon par jawaab dete hue sarkaar kii taraf se solicytor general tushaar mehta ne kaha tha, 'sivisi ne yah nishkarsh nikaala tha ki ek asaadhaaran paristhiti he or asaadhaaran paristhitiyon se nipatane ke liye kabhi-kabhi asaadhaaran upaay bhi karne padate hai
 The order of the CVC was impartial, with the two top officials fighting amongst themselves and investigating cases against each other, barring important matters
 ' unhone kaha tha ki sibiai main jaise halaat the, usamen sivisi mookadarshak ban kar nahin baitha rah saktaa tha
 To do so would be to ignore our obligation
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki chunki nideshak alok verma or vishesh nideshkarakesh asthana neek-duusare par aarope lagaae hai
 Therefore, both have been sent on leave on the advice of the Central Vigilance Commission for a fair investigation
 haalanki jaankaar yah kah rahe the ki dilli vishesh police pratishthan (dspi) adhinium, 1946 kii dhara 4a(1) ke tahat sibiai nideshak ko us chayan samiti kii sahmati ke bina nahin hataaya ja saktaa he, jisane nideshak kii niyukti kii sifarish kii thi
 In this selection committee, the Prime Minister is the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
 kanoon ke mutabik sibiai nideshak kaa tabadalaa bhi bina chayan samiti kii sahmati ke nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The CBI had registered an FIR against Rakesh Asthana for taking bribe in the investigation against meat exporter Moin Qureshi, while Asthana on the other hand also accused Alok Verma of taking bribe
 iske pehle alok verma ne sibiai ke vishesh nideshak rakesh asthana se sari zimmedaariyaan waapas le lee thim

 khufia sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik tibet ke tyaak ilaake main sutluj nadi ke bharat main bahaav ko rokane ke liye nirmaan kaary kar rahaa he
 It is being told that China has diverted water to its side by stopping the flow of about 100 meters of the Sutlej river
 china sarhad se 16 kilometre dur nirmaan kaaryon main laga he
 China's plan is to use water to create hydro power by stopping the flow of the river
 tibet main sutluj nadi ke kinare nirmaan kaaryon main istemaal hone vaali 10 se 15 badi gaadiyaan dekhi gai hai
 Also, a heavy movement of Chinese soldiers has been seen in the area
 bataa den ki china kii ore se pehle brahmaputra ke pani ko rokane kii koshish bhi kii ja chuki he
 Indian security agencies have now expressed concern over reports that China has stopped the flow of the Sutlej river water

 Last year, the Brahmaputra caused massive destruction in the North East due to floods
 isi tarah sutluj main zyada pani se kheti par bhi kaaphi asar padaa
 Security expert PK Sehgal says that China has been engaged in such activities for the last 8-10 years regarding the water of rivers
 sahagal ke mutabik aisi 14 nadiyaan hai jinka udgam tibet se hota he
 He said about China's project on the river bed of Sutlej in Tibet, that it could have serious consequences
 sahagal ne ashanka jataai ki is tarah ke hatkande apnaane se china pani roak kar hamaare kshetra ko sukha saktaa he
 If this happens, the entire country may have to bear the brunt of the fall in crops
 sahagal ne kaha ki china chaahe to bade paimaane par critical kshetron main pani chhodkar bhi nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 Sehgal said that China is not only diverting the Sutlej river but is also diverting the water of many rivers in this manner
