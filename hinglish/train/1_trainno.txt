 - input bhashaa se There has always been a figure of thirty-six among the politicians of Gangajal, Prakash Jha and Bihar
 is sach ko khud prakaash jha se acha koi nahin jaanata
 Although each of his films remain in dispute before release due to some reason, which gives the film good publicity, but Prakash Jha's new film Jai Gangajal is not in his own home state of Bihar and this time Rashtriya Janata Dal Rather, he has been the victim of resentment of the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 darasal, prakaash jha kii nai film main jo khalanaayak hai wo bankipur vidhansabha kshetra ke vidhayak hai
 And it is a coincidence that in Bihar by the name of Bankipur, it is also an assembly constituency in the capital Patna, whose MLA is BJP leader Nitin Naveen
 nitin do baar se is kshetra kaa pratinidhiv kar rahe hai or unki chhavi saafe sudhari he, lekin nitin naveen ko dar he ki is film se unki chhavi par pratikul asar padegaa
 So they want either Bankipur's name to be removed from the film or the film's performance be stopped
 vahiin, prakaash jha kaa kahana he ki is film kii prishthbhumi bihar kii nahin he or is film main priyanka chopra kii vardi par bhi madhya pradesh police kaa baij he
 Hence, the apprehension of Nitin Naveen is needless
 prakaash jha daawa he ki unhone kisi ko thes pahunchane ke liye ye naam nahin daalaa
 At the same time, Nitin Naveen alleges that Jha has used Bankipur's name, inspired by maliciousness
 unka kahana he ki puure desh main bankipur ekmaatr vidhansabha kshetra he, joki bihar main he or yahaan se wo do baar vidhayak hai
 The comments jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki bijepi is mudde par aakraamak he, kyonki prakaash jha janata dal united se pichhlaa loksabhaa chunaav betia se haar chuke hai
 Earlier, he had also contested the 2009 Lok Sabha election on Lok Janshakti Party ticket and both times he had to face defeat
 saal 2003 main gangaajal film ke release hone par rashtriya janata dal ne iskaa is aadhaar par virodh kiya tha ki us film main khalanaayak kaa naam sadhu yadav he or sadhu us samay kii mukhyamantri rabari devi ke bhai hai
 Later, the monks were allowed to release her in Bihar after watching the film, but Gangajal was a hit due to the publicity it received due to the protest
 haalanki kuch varshon purv jab jha ne aarakshan naamak film banaai to vah darshakon ko theatre main nahin khinch pai
 Actually, the villains in Prakash Jha's new film are mlas from Bankipur constituency
 or ye sanyog he ki bankipur naam se bihar main, wo bhi rajdhani patna main ek vidhansabha kshetra he, jiske vidhayak bijepi netaa nitin naveen hai
 Nitin has been representing the region for two times and his image has improved, but Nitin Naveen fears that this film will adversely affect his image
 isliye ve chaahate hai ki yaa to film se bankipur kaa naam hataaya jaae yaa film kaa pradarshan roka jaae
 At the same time, Prakash Jha says that the background of this film is not from Bihar and the uniform of Priyanka Chopra in this film also has the badge of Madhya Pradesh Police
 lihaaja, nitin naveen kii ashanka bevajaah he
 Prakash Jha claims that he did not enter this name to offend anyone
 vahiin, nitin naveen kaa aarope he ki jha ne durbhaavna se prerit hokar bankipur ke naam kaa istemaal kiya he
 He says that Bankipur is the only assembly constituency in the entire country, which is in Bihar and from here he is a two-time MLA
 tippaniyan Experts believe that the BJP is aggressive on this issue, as Prakash Jha has lost the last Lok Sabha election from Janata Dal United to Bettiah
 isse purv bhi unhone 2009 kaa loksabhaa chunaav bhi lok janashakti party kii tikat par ladaa tha or donon baar unhen haar kaa muh dekhnaa padaa tha
 On the release of the film Gangajal in 2003, Rashtriya Janata Dal opposed it on the grounds that the villain's name in that film is Sadhu Yadav and Sadhu is brother of the then Chief Minister Rabri Devi
 baad main sadhu ke karibiyon ne film dekhne ke baad use bihar main release karne kii anumati di thi, lekin virodh ke kaaran mili publicity kii vajah se gangaajal hit rahi thi
 However, when Jha made a film called Reservation a few years ago, she could not pull the audience into the theater
 vahiin, prakaash jha kaa kahana he ki is film kii prishthbhumi bihar kii nahin he or is film main priyanka chopra kii vardi par bhi madhya pradesh police kaa baij he
 Hence, the apprehension of Nitin Naveen is needless

 abhi north pole par nordarn lits dekhne ke liye har saal kareeb 1000 paryatak aate hai
 But if you want to stay in this hotel, then you have to go only in April
 kyonki baaki samay yahaan par bhayanak thand rahati he
 The idea for this hotel is by Jane Honeken, founder and CEO of Luxury Action
 unki company hai-and travel company he, jo uttari dhruv par logon ko ghumaane kii visheshgyata rakhti he
 When tourists visit in April, the temperature in the North Pole will be around minus 20 to minus 40 degrees Celsius
 lekin yah samay ghoomane ke hisaab se saal kaa sabase behtareen samay rahata he
 a five star hotel room, a girl sleeping in the room and the corpse of a young man hanging in the room
 ladki jab so kar uthati he to fande par jhulati apane dost kii laash dekh kar hairaan rah jaati he kyonki jab wo soi thi tab uskaa dost jinda tha, lekin kuch hi ghanton main aakhir aisi kya baat hui ki kamare main maujuud noujvaan ne aatmahatya kar lee
 There was a female friend in the room
 As soon as the news of suicide of a young boy came from room number 426 in the evening evening of Hottledredison Blue, there was chaos in the entire hotel
 marane vaale kii pahchaan karne main police ko zyada vakt nahin laga
 25-year-old Abhishek belonged to a Delhi-based business family, and was found hanging from a wardrobe in his Lashotel hotel room
 chashmadidon se hi police ko ye bhi pataa chalaa tha ki abhishek ke saath uske kamare main uski mahila mitra bhi maujuud thi
 a case of suicide between suicide and murder revealed by the hotel records that Abhishek had checked in to the tenth floor room number 426 of the hotel at 2 pm on the 15th
 us vakt uske saath unki mahila mitra bhi thi
 Thursday afternoon the two had dinner, and went to their rooms
 shaam ko kareeb chah baje abhishek kii mahila mitra ne hotel staff ko is khudakushi kii ittela di
 The news of Abhishek's death also reached his family members and when they saw the hotel room with their eyes, they refused to commit suicide and raised some questions that stuck the matter between suicide and murder
 gharavaalon ne uthaae sawaljo sawaal abhishek ke gharavaalon ne uthaae hai, unhen bhi darkinar nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki jis kamare main, jin halaat main or jis jagah abhishek kii laash mili
 Seeing them, Abhishek did not think that he had committed suicide
 sutron ke mutabik abhishek ne goun kii belt se fanda lagaakar khudakushi kii, lekin jis vakt abhishek ne faansee lagaai, kamare main uski mahila mitra maujuud thi or uske bayaan ke mutabik jis vakt abhishek ne aatmahatya kii wo so rahi thi
 Suicides do not come from the neck According to family members, Abhishek's weight is more than about 100 kg
 aise main goun kii belt se latak kar khudakushi karne kii baat gale se nahin utarati or wo isliye bhi kyonki jis warderob se latakane kii baat saamne ai he
 There was no swivel or hook in which the end of the belt could be stuck
 ek sawaal ye bhi ki jis vakt abhishek ne apane gale main faansee kaa fanda lagaaya hoga or uskaa dam ghutane laga hoga to uske haath pair jameen yaa warderob se takaraae ho or usase itani aawaaj to ho hi sakati he ki kamare main aasaani se sunai de
 Seeing the post-mortem report, the police were also surprised
 At first sight, Abhishek's death was also felt suicidal by the police, but when the post-mortem report came, the police were also surprised
 postmortem report se pataa chalaa ki abhishek kii maut galaa dabaane kii vajah se hui he
 Abhishek did not commit suicide and if Abhishek did not commit suicide then who is responsible for his death
 postmortem report main saamne aayaa ki abhishek kii maut galaa dabaane kii vajah se hui he
 In the initial investigation of the police, it has been revealed that Abhishek and his female friends have known each other for a long time and the woman's husband was also reported to be close to both of them
 teen oktober ko usne apane pati kaa ghar chhod diya tha or wo apane maayke main rah rahi thi
 The woman's husband also knew Abhishek very well and often Abhishek used to come to her house
 mahila ke pati kulbir ke mutabik logon ne donon ko kai baar ek saath ghoomte hue dekha tha or iske bare main unhone use bataaya bhi
 According to Kulbir, he explained to Abhishek many times and also mentioned about his wife and Abhishek to his family, but the meeting of the two did not diminish
 mahila mitra ke pati ne di dhamkikulbir kii maane to abhishek kii maut ke baad uski patni ne use phone kiya tha or bataaya ki abhishek ne uske saath dhokhaa kiya he
 He first called her to the hotel and then committed suicide
 duusari ore abhishek kaa parivaar uski hatya kaa iljaam kulbir, uski patni or uske saale par laga rahe hai
 According to him, some time ago, Kulbir had threatened that he would kill Abhishek or his brother Chirag
 police kar rahi mahila mitra se poochtampostmortem report aane ke baad gajiabad police ne hatya kaa maamla darj kar liya he or abhishek kii mahila mitra kohiraasat main lekarpuchhatacha kar rahi he
 The police is also investigating the CCTV of the hotel to ascertain who visited Abhishek's room during his stay in the hotel
 police ne abhishek kaa visra bhi jaanch ke liye bhej diya he
 The death in a five-star hotel has confused the police
 police mahila mitra ke saath hi uske pati or uske bhai se bhi poochtacha karegi taaki abhishek kii maut kii gutthi ko suljhaayaa ja sake

 Two-time winner Uruguay will face 1998 winner France in the first quarter-finals of the 21st edition of the FIFA World Cup
 behtareen form main chal rahi donon timen nijani novgorod stadium main semifinal main jane kii koshish main hongi
 Both France and Uruguay have beaten teams of legendary players in the quarter-finals
 urugve ne pre-quarter final main christiano ronaldo kii portugal ko haraaya tha, to vahiin france ne leonnelle mesi kii argentina ko shikast de apane khitaabi abhiyaan ko jinda rakhaa he
 This match will in a way test the strong defense of both the teams
 aatmavishvaas se bhari donon tiimon ke bich kii jang romaanchak hone kii puri ummid he
 Uruguay have not lost a single match so far and have scored just one goal
 vahiin, ajey to france bhi rahi he, lekin usne abhi tak kaa is vishwa cap kaa pehla drow khelaa he
 The biggest concern for Ronaldouruguay, supporting injured Cavani, is that his striker Edinson Cavani, who scored two goals against Portugal, is injured
 pre-quarter final main unhen chot lag gai thi or isliye unhen maidan se baahar janaa padaa tha
 Whether or not he will play in the quarter-finals is still in doubt
 coach auskar tabrej ke liye unke vikalp kaa chunaav mushkil hoga
 The absence of Kavani also gives Uruguay a chance that the team's biggest player, Louise Suarez, will not have an effective match in the match, which could also weaken Suarez
 pichley match main kavani ne suarej kii madad se hi gol kiye the
 The pair score goals under the nose of the opposition team
 vahiin, france ke dephence ne mesi jaise khilaadi ko baandhe rakhaa, wo ek gol kar gaye the, lekin uske baad vah khulkar nahin khel paae
 Samuel Ummitti in France, stopping Uruguay's attack on Rafael Varan may prove to be a crooked pudding
 france ke liye is match main ek chintaa kaa vishay yah he ki wo blaase matuidi ke sthaan par kise maidan par utaaregi, jo nilamban ke kaaran yah match nahin khel paaenge

 They have done this before also
 isaki shuruyaat hui thi viraat kohli ke vanade or tii20 captain banane ke baad

 Apart from this, he also opened in the only T20 match played in the West Indies with Shikhar Dhawan
 vahiin ipel kii baat karen to apni team royal chalanger bengalooru ke liye bhi viraat kohli niyamit rup se opening karte he
 In such a situation, this claim of Virat Kohli can prove useful for Team India

 The next hearing on November 15, in the case of tree felling, the Supreme Court asked - how many trees were cut and how many were planted
 Work will stop
 ab is maamle main 15 november ko agali sunwaayee hogi
 Along with this, the Supreme Court also called for a report on the condition of the plants to grow or survive in the Aarey region, that is, they asked for the health card of the plants
 supreme court ne somvaar ko sunwaayee ke dauraan poocha ki kitne ped kaate gaye the? nae paudhe kitne lagaae gaye? unamem se paudhe kitne bache hai?supreme court ne kaha ki court ko tasviren bhi dikhaai jaaen
 The Supreme Court has asked the Metro and Mumbai Corporation whether any commercial project is also proposed in this area? The Supreme Court said that we want to see not just this area but the whole region
 HC main yachika khaarijisase pehle ismahine kii shuruyaat main supreme court ne maharashtra sarkaar ko yathasthiti banaae rakhane or maamle kii agali sunwaayee kii tithi 21 oktober tak koi ped nahin kaatane kaa aadesh diya tha
 Law student Rishav Ranjan wrote a letter to Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi seeking intervention in the matter, after which a special bench was set up to hear the case

 What is the matter? The entire matter dates back to March 2015, when the Maharashtra government appointed a six-member technical committee to look into the issue of setting up a metro car depot at Aarey Colony from an ecological point of view
 12 june, 2015 ko paryaavaran visheshgyon ne ek note likhaa tha, jisamen unhone mumbai kii paristhitiki kaa hawala dete hue aare colony ke pedo or khuli jagahon ko bachaane kii vakaalat kii thi
 In July 2015, some environmentalists cited Kanjurmarg as a better alternative to Aarey Colony for the construction of a metro car shed
 is varsh 29 agast ko, mumbai metro rail korporation limited (mmrsiel) ko brihanmumbai nagar nigam ke ped praadhikaar se apane pariyojna ke liye 2,185 pedo ko kaatane or 460 pedo ko lagane kii anumati mil gai thi
 According to Bathena, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation tree authority had allowed MMRC to cut trees this year without following the procedures of the proposal to cut the trees decided by the High Court

 a special investigation by Headlines Today has revealed that Minister of Fertilizers and Chemicals MK Alagiri has ignored a series of disputed decisions by his ministry
 isse sarkari khajaane ko bhi baari nuksaan pahunchaa he
 The lower level ministers in the ministry kept making these mistakes but their boss refused to accept it
 kyon sabsidi or keemten lagaataar bad rahi hai?hedlins today kii jaanch se yah bhi saamne aayaa ki alaagiri ne apane mantralay main kisaanon kii keemton par nijee companiyon ko apratyaashit laabh kii anumati di thi
 High officials and manufacturers together ensure market prices for fertilizers that are beyond the reach of ordinary farmers
 upie 2 ke daur main urvarak sabsadi bill main 10 guna vruddhi dekhi gai
 But the prices of fertilizers being sold to the farmers greatly increased
 mahangaa hone ke kaaran gramin kshetron main ab urvarak kaa sankat utpann ho gaya he
 Objections of Junior Minister Shrikant Jena, a junior minister, brought the disturbances in fertilizer sector to MK Alagiri
 yahi nahin shrikant ne alaagiri tak ye baat likhit rup se bheji
 From March to August 2012, one such written letter stated, 'the company has made a lot of profit and is headed from within the ministry
 ' jena lagaataar apane patron se algiri ko in gadbadiyon se avgat karaate rahe lekin algiri lagaataar inhen nazarandaaj karte gaye
 Alagiri never took any important steps to stop these scams
 17 july 2012 main jena ne likhaa, 'sarkaar kisaanon ke hit ke liye sabsidi paas karti he jisase khudara keemat uchit str par bani rahe
 But the private company is fixing the prices for the farmers and taking undue benefits
 aise main sabsidi kaa koi arth nahin rah jaataa he
 In the same note, Jena informed that the fertilizer company keeps one-third of the total subsidy released to farmers
 jena ne apane is baat ke pukhta saboot bhi pesh kiye
 August 3, 2012 Jena again wrote a letter, 'companies are making huge profits by selling fertilizers at higher prices
 ' unhone phir vahi jaankaree di ki diapi ke prati metric tone main chaar se paanch hajaar rupayon kaa sabsadi or complex urvarak par chah hajaar rupayon kii sabsidi nijee companiyon ke paas ja rahaa he
 Jena also demanded an inquiry into the accounts of these companies
 jena ne bataaya ki vibhaag ko tatkaal sudharatmak karrwai kerani chahie thi lekin algiri kii ore se koi kadam nahin uthaaya gaya
 Now the question arises that what was stopping the DMK leader from taking action against these companies? Could companies make this profit without the help of the Ministry? The series of letters of Jena had no effect on Alagiri and he did not take any appropriate action on this issue
 jahaan aam logon ke tex ke paise se haive or kisaanon baandh banaae jate hai, vahiin kuch kisaan urvarkon kii badhati keemton ke kaaran aatmahatya bhi kar lete hai
 Jena also revealed to Alagiri some orders passed by the authorities in early 2012
 isamen mantralay kii nijee companiyon ke saath santh-ganth saaf ujagar ho rahi thi lekin iske baavjood alaagiri ne chuppi saadhe rakhi
 Many companies used fertilizer to market excessively to get more subsidies
 ek baar urvarak bazaar main aa jaataa to company dobaaraa sabsidi lene ke liye taiyaar ho jaati
 Jena also informed the department that the company is making plans to take more subsidy under the scheme which should not be allowed
 lekin iskaa vibhaag par koi asar nahin hua or dobaar order paarit kar die gaye
 In a letter written on 19 March, Jena informed that 'the fertilizer industry is not able to provide fertilizer to the farmers at the right time of farming
 samay se pehle hi urvarak kii kaala bazaari ho jaati he jisase kisaanon par boj bad rahaa he or sarkaar kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 This time too, Jena's efforts went in vain and no proper action was taken on the whole matter
 junior mantri ke mutabik, varsh 2011-12 main jis samay urvarak kii jarurat nahin he tab uski khapat se sarkaar ne adhik sabsidi daron kaa daawa kiya
 The opposition anyway takes Alagiri as an absentee minister
 alaagiri par yah aarope he ki vah kabhi cabinet kii baithkon main bhaag nahin lete or naa hi mantralay ke mahatvapurn kaaryon main hissaa lete hai
 a special investigation by Headlines Today shows that Alagiri is running the ministry according to his jagir
 charhari kaaya kii khatir kii jane vaali dieting munh se durgandh aane kaa ek kaaran bhi ban sakati he
 Researchers say that decreasing the order of food affects the amount of saliva produced in the mouth, while saliva is very useful for removing odor-causing substances
 danta rog visheshgy dow madhu ghai kahati hai ki munh se aane vaali durgandh ek aam samasya he or hamamen se kai log iske shikaar hai, lekin zyaadaatar ko yah ahsaas nahin hota ki unke munh se durgandh aati he
 However, if there is a bad mouth when going in a crowd or when meeting people, a situation of great shame arises
 vah kahati hai, aisa nahin he ki yah samasya laailaaj he
 Drinking water at regular intervals can relieve this problem to a great extent
 kuch bhi khaane ke baad daant saaf karnaa behad jaruri he, lekin hamaare desh main durbhaagya se is baat ko log nahin samajhate
 Dieting is also a reason for bad mouth odor, because the amount of saliva produced in the mouth is reduced by not eating anything for a long time
 jabaki laar durgandh paidaa karne vaale tatwon ko dur karne ke liye behad jaruri hoti he
 Dr
 Rakesh Sharma, another dentist, says dieters should also look at its harmful aspects
 thos nahin to kam se kam taral aahaar kaa niyamit kram main seven karke munh kii durgandh se bachaa ja saktaa he
 Naturopath Dr
 Casey Garg says that with the slightest care, bad breath can be avoided
 khaane ke baad bhojan ke kuch kan munh main rah jate hai, jinaki safai na hone par vahaan bacteria ekatra ho jate hai or phir durgandh aane lagati he
 Lack of saliva also causes foul smell
 tambaakoo ke utpaada to munh se durgandh kaa mukhya kaaran hote hi hai
 Apart from this, due to bronchitis, diabetes, sinusitis, stomach problem, liver or kidney problems, mouth odor can also occur
 vah kehete hai, yah laailaaj samasya nahin he
 a little solution can solve this
 lekin sabase pehle daanton kii safai kii ore dhyaan dena jaruri he
 Dr
 Ghai says, dieting people should avoid liquid odor after regular intervals, so that the salivary gland does not get disrupted and remove the elements that cause odor in the mouth
 Saliva needed to be produced

 This defeat of the Congress was quite embarrassing as the party came to power just six months ago by winning the assembly elections
 party ke ek netaa ne naam na jaahir karne ke anurodh ke saath kaha, "satta ke do centre banane ke kaaran hamaari party main sthitiyaan kharaab huin
 One leader is connected to the ground, while the other is highlife and speaks in English even in rural areas

 " sutron ne kaha ki kai netaa sochate hai ki party kaa netaa koi ek hona chahie
 a local party leader said, "intervention of more people makes things worse
 "netaa ne kaha ki jaipur, jaipur gramin, jhalawad, raatsamand, ajmer or bhilwara sahit kam se kam chah siton par galat logon ko tikat die gaye
 Meanwhile, the BJP has demanded Gehlot to resign on moral grounds

 Sushil Modi said that the manure factory in Barauni, established during the tenure of Shri Krishna Babu, was closed during the tenure of Lalu Prasad, which was started by the Narendra Modi government at a cost of 7500 crores and in the next two years this factory Will be turned on
 jabaki shrikrishna babu ke nidhan ke baad 25 varshon tak satta main rahane ke baavzdu congress kuch nahin kar pai

 Just as the most popular prime time sentence on the news channels, 'desh wants to know' has become, it seems to be on the same lines that 'desh wants a ban' at the time of helplessness in a crisis is the national solution of this country
 
 main aisa kahkar na to nakal kar rahaa hum or na hi koi maang uthaa rahaa hum
 It is simply a fact that the ban has become our favorite recipe for dealing with every problem

 Professional revolutionaries landed on the streets are satisfied on hearing this, because all they needed was someone's head to adorn them among their souls

 The only exception to this is the ordinary woman in Delhi who is not judiciously clapping on our latest craze in last week's list of sanctions, as it has violated her freedom and options while we are taking a step in the name of enhancing her security
 We have not been able to move forward
 ghatnaon ko silsilewar yaad karnaa upyogi hoga
 First, the Delhi Police sends a notice to the taxi service operator company Uber to help in the investigation
 uski naakaami kii aalochana badhati he, to vah ubar par pratibandh laga detii he
 Then many people start laughing at it while the working women of Delhi, in particular, boil over
 tab ola, quick, dilli cab samet kai anya sevaaon par pratibandh laga diya jaataa he
 If you have already decided to make fools then it is better to maintain balance
 aise faisle ne dilli main kaamkaaji auraton kii badhati aabaadi ko paanch saal peeche dhakel diya he or unhen kaali-pili khatara kaaron ke rahamo-karam par chhod diya he
 Recall the days when you used to take pre-paid taxis from the police monitoring booths at Delhi airport or railway station, and the driver, sitting with a disciple on the front seat, stopped in the middle of the road and asked for money
 pehle to vah mahange petrol kii parichit kahani se apni baat shuru karata or agar aap prabhavit na hue to dhamkee par utar aata tha
 Imagine how frightening it would be if you were traveling at night with your family
 or phir ek akeli aurat?thik he ki ubar ko ab bhi apni gaiyr-jimmedaari or driver kii jaanch main laaparvaahee ko lekar kai jawaab dene hai, lekin pehle us par pratibandh lagaana, phir ipisi kii dhara 420 ke tahat dhokhadhadi ke liye us par exiar darj karnaa or ant main baaki ko iske lapete main lekar pratibandh lad dena to khantee bhartiya kaam hi ho saktaa he
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh has also spoken of banning cab companies in other states and cities

 Surprisingly, such a response has come from the very experienced and intelligent Rajnath Singh, who has been the Chief Minister of the country's largest state

 i may have dragged my point a little longer, but there is no doubt that it has helped the most cunning department under his command, the Delhi Police, to divert attention from the root of the problem
 samasya kii jad yah he ki ateet main balaatkaar ke aaropee rahe shaks ko aakhir kaise anaapatti pramaan patr de diya gaya
 The widespread tragedy in this case is similar to the incident of December 16, exactly two years ago — the thing should have been how to make public spaces and facilities safe for women, which has never happened

 aap ritel kaarobaar karne vaali company emve se puch kar dekhie- jiskaa america siio andhra main kuch vakt jail main bitaa chukaa he—yaa phir taaja chamchamati i-commers companiyon se puch len
 These companies are raising billions of foreign capital, but multibrand retail is still illegal for us to say here

 zyada gharelu cricket khilne kaa mauka milegaa to isamen sudhaar hi hoga, jaisaa ki tamaam tiimon ke saath hota he
 Even today the same 'rotten-throat' BCCI is running this game which has put India at the center of the power and economy of world cricket
 supreme court jis 'sadaandh’ ko dur karne main juta he, vah match-phiksang ko lekar bhi nahin he balki sattebaaji or hiton ke takaraav se judi he
 This is because betting is prohibited in India, but is as prevalent as alcohol in Gujarat

 For this, just betting has to be made legal and it will have to be taxed

 The question is, who will do this in this ban-loving country? An impossible defense: india-australia cricket series is about to begin
 lihaaja, hamaare saarvajanik vimarsh main ek or vichlan par sawaal khadaa karne kaa yah sahi vakt he
 The popular phrase in our public vocabulary from cricket is 'come on the backfoot'
 ’ cricket premiyon ko satark ho janaa chahie, khaskar isliye kyonki sardiyon main ho saktaa he, hamen bhor main jaagnaa pade jaisaa ki pichley mangalvaar ko hua jab hamane david warner ko spin or pes gendbaaji ko sidhe boundry ke paar pahunchaate dekha tha
 That too while on the backfoot! i cannot say when we started to discredit the backfoot
 hamaare bich kahin zyada cricket kii pukhta viraasat rakhane vaale rajdeep saradesai maanate hai ki aisa isliye hua hoga kyonki bhartiya ballebaaj paaramparik rup se front foot par aage bad kar khelte the
 a far more damaging explanation could be that we have always been in awe of short and bouncy bouncer balls that 'pushed' us on the backfoot
 kuch sarvaadhik aakraamak shot baikfoot par hi khele gaye hai, khaskar cat, pul, square cat or hook jaise khatarnaak shot
 Or the neatly played leg glasses that Ranji invented, the late cut, or the art of stealing a single from the fine leg by lightening the hip, which was popularly known as Ravi Shastri's chapati shot
 yahi shot jab vivies lakshmana kii kalai se nikalataa to us par chauke kii muhar lagi hoti thi
 Once i had asked Sachin to list the shot he would like to steal from his fellow players, then he mentioned VVS Laxman's 'hip-hopping' shot
 aajkal aap viraat kohli ko yah shot back foot par covers main lagaate hue dekh sakate hai
 The subject of this column is the whims of the ban, so don't forget Phil Hughes who lost a bouncer hooked on the backfoot and continues to demand a ban on the bouncer
 chaahe jo ho, aadhunik style ke tii-20 mark cricket ne ballebaaji kii takneekon ko dobaaraa gadha he
 Now just look at the ball and root the shot
 cricket kii is nai saahasik duniya main jahaan sahvaag, warner or devilliars jaise khilaadi front foot par bhi cat maar sakate hai or kitaabi jamini shot khilne ke bajaae point par hawa main gend ko oochaal sakate hai, aapako apni shabdaawalee hi durust kerani padegi
 If nothing, then bury the ill-fated idiom of the back foot
 saansad pappu yadav surkhiyon main bane rahane ke liye lagaataar vivaadit bayaan dene ke liye jane jate hai
 Pappu Yadav, who arrived in Darbhanga on Tuesday, made a statement that created controversy
 pappu yadav ne kaha ki naksali javaanon kii nahin balki rajanetaaon kii hatya karen to behatar hoga
 Actually, Pappu Yadav has come out after being kept in Patna's Beur Jail for 3 weeks and after coming out, on Tuesday, he reached Darbhanga to meet the family of the martyred soldier Naresh Yadav in Sukma's Naxalite attack
 shahid naresh yadavake parivaar waalon se milane par pappu yadav ne unhen santvanaa or 5 xxrep 4 0 rupye kii aarthik madad bhi kii
 Pappu also announced to bear the expenses of the martyr's daughter's wedding
 parivaar waalon se milane ke badapappu yadavane patrakaron se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki naksaliyon ko javaanon ko nahin balki desh ke rajanetaaon ko khatm karnaa chahie
 Pappu said that Naxalites should kill the politicians who are running the country's system
 pappu kaa maananaa tha ki naksali ko surakshabalon ke khilaaf nahin balki netaaon ke khilaaf jang chhedane chahie
 Pappu said that the country's political policy is very poor and the poor are becoming more and more poor and needy people are not getting justice but are being exploited
 aisa pehali baar nahin he ki desh ke netaaon ko lekar pappu yadav ke bol bighad gaye hai
 Even before this, Pappu Yadav has made a strong comment on the corrupt leaders of the country and advocated to shoot them on sight

 video main saaf dekha ja saktaa he ki thane main jafar imam fariyadi kii fariyaad bhi sun rahaa he or saath hi saath ek aadmi se apane peeth or sir kaa massage karvaa rahaa he
 The surprising thing is that while this policeman is getting his massage done at the police station, he is in uniform
 massage karavaate is video main police vaale ko saaf taur par fariyadi se bhi abhadra bhashaa main baat karte hue suna ja saktaa he
 After this video went viral, Kaimurpulis administration came into action and the SP has suspended the line
 is maamle ko lekar camoor dspi ajay prasad ne kaha ki jafar imam kii is harakat se police kii chhavi daagdar hui he or isi kaaran se uske khilaaf police adheekshak ne kadi karrwai karte hue use nilambit kar line hajir kar diya he
 Ujjain, the city of Mahakal, is getting ready to host Simhastha Mahakumbh once in 12 years
 lekin april main shuru hone ja rahe is maha-aayojan se jude dheron kaam or pariyojnaayen behad sust gati se chal rahi hai
 Despite the huge budget, work related to Simhastha is far behind and looking at the preparations, it seems that many works will not be completed even after the start of the fair
 purv mukhyamantri or congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne aarope lagaaya he ki sinhasth-2004 main hue ghotaalon kii jaanch puri nahin ho pai he or ab unhen phir se bhrashtachar karne kaa mauka mil gaya he
 He said, "all the contractors who work are from the BJP and the officials are commissions
 bijepi sarkaar main khub khao, khilaao kaa maahaul he
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who dreams of making this event of international standard starting from 22 April to 21 May, is troubled by the sluggish pace of preparations
 mela shuru hone main mahaj teen maheene hi bache hai
 This is the reason why he has asked a minister to visit Ujjain every week to review the works related to Simhastha
 adhuri yojanaayenkhan nadi ke jariye kshipraa main aa rahi gandagi ko lekar sadhu-sant hameshaa se naaraazgi jaahir karte rahe hai
 To overcome this problem, the State Government had prepared the Khan River diversion plan, whose main objective was to keep the waters of the Kshipra River clean
 khan nadi ke diavarjan ke kaam kaa jimmaa jal sansaadhan vibhaag ke paas he
 Deadline for the end of February 2016 has been fixed for this
 lekin 19 kilometre lambii or 90 karod ru
 This plan has completely backfired
 aayojan shuru hone se pehle yojana ke puraa hone kii ummid na ke baraabar he
 Under the plan, 7,480 pipes were to be laid out of which only 5,500 pipes have been poured so far while about 2,000 pipes are yet to be poured
 sethu nigam ke suparintending ejeeniyar el
 K
 dube ne kaha ki overbrij ke kaam ko jald se jald puraa kiya jayega or isamen deree khan nadi diavarjan ke kaam kii vajah se hui he
 Similarly Rs 40 crore for construction of railway overbridge on Chintaman and Badnagar bypass
 aavantit kiye gaye the
 The purpose of the plan was that the movement at the railway gate continued continuously during the fair
 nirmaan puraa karne kii antim taarikh 15 disambar thi
 The deadline was extended to 31 January in view of the sluggish pace of construction
 lekin kaam kii gati abhi bhi sust bani hui he, aise main nirmaan nai dedline main puraa ho paaegaa, isamen andeh he
 At the same time, a seven-storey hospital was being built by breaking the TB Hospital on Agar Road, Ujjain
 iskaa kaam 31 disambar, 2015 tak puraa hona tha par ab sarkaar kaa daawa he ki yah 15 march tak puraa ho jayega
 The work of widening of roads in the city is also going on at a very slow pace
 ujjain se taraana road ke chaudeekaran ke liye 30 karod ru
 Allotments were made but this work will be completed in time, there is doubt
 sinhasth ke liye agar ke saath hi ujjain se devas tak road ko chaudaa karne kaa kaam ho rahaa he
 Apart from this, the work of removing encroachments on the roads is also going on
 kuch pariyojnaon kaa to uddeshy hi samaj nahin aa rahaa
 7 crores near Mahakal temple Rs
 kii laagat se ek tunnel (gupha) banaai ja rahi he
 During Simhastha, the tunnel is being built keeping in mind the crowd inside Mahakal
 iskaa makasad yah he ki bheed ko kam samay main mandir ke andar darshan karwaae ja saken
 Officials claim to have completed it by April
 sinhasth ke adhure pade kaaryon ke alaava sadhu-santon kii naaraazgi bhi shivaraj sarkaar ke liye chintaa kaa bada vishay he
 There is resentment among the saints about the land being allotted to the ashrams and they are also filing complaints in this regard from the administration
 nirmohi ani akhaade ke sant madanamohan das kehete hai, ''prashasan bhoomi aavanton main bhedbhaav kar rahaa he
 The process of allocation is beyond comprehension
 '' sadhu-santon kaa aarope he ki bhoomi aavanton main bhed-bhav kiya ja rahaa he jaise acchhee or kshipraa ke najadik jameen chaheton ko di ja rahi he
 The saint-saints are also angry over the dirt in the river Kshipra
 unka daawa he ki kshipraa main pradooshan rokane or gandagi saaf karne ke liye abhi tak sarkaar ne koi thos kaam nahin kiya he
 Apart from saints and saints, common people are also complaining about politics in religious ceremonies
 kshipraa nadi ke kinare 10 bigha jameen ke maalik nand kishor or unke bhai ambaram ko sinhasth ke liye ban rahe ek pul ke nirmaan ke liye apni 3 bigha jameen deni padi he
 This bridge of Narsingh Ghat will ease the way of movement of millions of people
 lekin nand kishor kaa daawa he ki is pul ko sidhaa na banaakar netaaon or adhikariyon ne iskaa manamafik dizin bana diya he
 Says Nand Kishore, "the land of minister Paras Jain and MLA Mohan Yadav is coming in this way
 isliye iske dizin main badlaav kiya gaya he
 "while Ambaram says," The farmers have thus fallen prey to the arbitrariness of the administration
 ''is aayojan ko surakshit or shantipurna tareeke se sampann karana bhi sarkaar ke liye badi chunauti he
 481 CCTV cameras are to be installed at 125 important places in the city, through which any suspicious activity can be monitored
 abhi yah kaam puraa nahin hua he
 The government estimates that 50 million people will attend this fair
 shraddhaluon kii itani bheed ko sanbhaalane kii badhibia vyavastha karne ke liye sarkaar ne 2,462 karod ru
 Were allocated lekin ab tak vibhinn sarkari vibhaag sirf 800 karod ru
 Have been able to spend rajya sarkaar ne sinhasth ke liye 3,061 hectare jameen padaav kshetra main or 352 hectare satellite toun ke liye adhishuchet bhi kar di he
 Ujjain divisional commissioner Ravindra Pastor claims that all the works will be completed before the fair starts
 ve kehete hai, ''kuch kaaryon main deree jarur ho gai he lekin ham har kaary ko yudhstar par nibata denge
 Nobody will let anyone complain
 '' lekin is maha meley kii taiyaari aayojan shuru hone se pehle puri ho paaegi, isamen andeh he

 (enditivi profit dot com or news agency bhashaa se bhi input) Criminals are given early morning black clothes before execution; SDM gives executioner; Order gives tea and snacks before hanging
 Administration convicts can be hanged anytime
 faansee kii prakiya kya hoti he, faansee se bachane ke doshi ke kya adhikaar hote hai, in adhikaron ke khatm hone ke baad kya hota he, faansee dene se pehle jail prasashan kya taiyaariyaan karata he, jaise sawaal kaaphi ahm hai jinke bare main log jaananaa chaahate hai
 Apart from this, how will the convicts be hanged in jail, what is written in the jail manual, what is the hanging house like, questions also revolve on the mind and heart
 doshi ko milte hai kai adhikarasbake man main sawaal hai ki itane jaghanya aparaadh ke baavjoodfaansidene main itnaa lanbaa (7 saal) samay kyon lag rahaa he? is par tihaad ke purv diji ajay kashyap kaa kahana he ki maut kii sajaa ek aisi sajaa he jiske baad isamen koi vaapasi kii gunjaaish nahin hoti
 In such a case, the guilty are allowed to exercise their rights
 haalanki ise or lanbaa khinchne ke liye doshi or uske vakil kai chaal chalate hai
 The same happened in this case also
 hoicourt se faansee kii sajaa kaa faisla barkaraar hone ke baad supreme court main rivyuu yachika daakhil karne kii baat ho yaa faisle ko chunauti dene kii baat, usamen doshi ek saath yachika nahin daalate
 Rather, one by one petition is filed which takes a lot of time
 blike warrant ke intjaar main gelsare vikalp khatm hone ke baad tihaad prasashan doshiyon ko faansee se pehlerashtrapatike saamne kshamaa yachika likhane ke liye samay detaa he
 In the Nirbhaya case too, Tihar gave 7 days time to all the convicts Vinay, Akshay, Mukesh and Pawan to file an apology petition
 haalanki sirf vinay sharma ne yah yachika lagaai jisko dilli sarkaar ne khaarij karne kii sifarish karte hue alji anil baijal, alji ne grih mantralay or ab grih mantralay ne ise raashtrapati ke paas bhej diya he
 Now the President will send his decision to Tihar
 agar raashtrapati is yachika ko khaarij karte hai to tihaad prashasan court jayega or doshi ke khilaaf deth warrant (blike warrant bhi kehete hai) jari karaayega
 After this, the court will decide the date and time of hanging
 blike warrant jari karaane ke din se faansee ke din main 15 din kaa samay hota he
 These 15 days are used for various types of investigation of the prisoner, for arranging the hanging
 isamen parivaar ke logon ko aakhri baar kaidi se milwaaya jaataa he
 If the court wishes, Vinay Sharma can issue a black warrant of all the culprits after the dismissal of the Kishkema petition
 kyonki samay die jane ke baad mukesh, pawan, akshay ne yachika nahin lagaai lekin court inhen iskaa mauka de saktaa he
 In response to a question about the execution of the hanging rope from Buxar, Ajay Kashyap, former DG of Tihar Jail, said that as far as the executioner is concerned, it does not matter
 faansee rer cese main di jaati he
 The last hanging before now was given to Afzal Guru in 2013
 isliye jallaad kii permanent jarurat nahin he
 After the death warrant is issued, the hanging rope will be brought from Buxar
 tihaad jail number 3 main ek hi faansee ghar he
 Regarding this, former Tihar PRO Sunil Gupta said that the culprits in the jail can be hanged one by one
 yaa sabko ek saath bhi latakaaya ja saktaa he
 There is so much space in the jail that even the culprits are hung together
 subah-subah di jaati he faansifaansee garmi main subah 6 baje or sardi main subah 7 baje di jaati he
 Tea is served to the convict on the morning of the execution
 wo naashtaa karnaa chaahe to diya jaataa he
 Then let him take a bath
 phir use kaale kapade pahanaate hai
 While carrying in the hanging room, we hang a black bag on the face
 pairon main rassi baandh di jaati he
 Handcuffs are applied in the hands
 2 ghante tak latakta he sharirfaansee room main sirf esadm, supretendent or jallaad hote hai
 The sdms ask the convict about his will
 apni property agar he to kise deni he
 The executioner then pulls the lever at the behest of the superintendent and hangs the convict
 neeche kareeb 12 feet kii jagah hoti he
 Let hang for about 2 hours
 phir doctor check karata he or mrit ghoshit karata he
 If the government wishes, the body is given to the family after the postmortem, or if they do not

 unhone kaha ki sadan main kaarywahi nahin ho paane ke kaaran sansad kii pratishtha daanv par he
 After this, members of various parties started shouting slogans within zero time

 is bich, AIADMK or DMK ke sadsy chair ke kareeb aakar kaveri par baandh banaae jane ke virodh main narebaaji karne lage
 Amid the uproar, Home Minister Rajnath Singh spoke about the circumstances behind the imposition of President's rule in Jammu and Kashmir
 lekin shorgul ke kaaran unki baat suni nahin ja saki
 After this, the Chairman asked the Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad to give his opinion about this resolution
 aaazaad bolne ke liye khadey bhi hue, lekin hangaame ke kaaran vah apni baat shuru nahin kar paae
 After this, Naidu called the names of 12 members of both parties, referencing rules 255 and 256
 sadan ke niyam 255 ke tahat sabhapati kisi bhi sadsy ke aacharan ko lekar unhen sadan se baahar jane or us puure din sadan kii kaarywahi main bhaag nahin lene kaa nirdesh dete hai

 Not seeing a ruckus in the house, Harivansh adjourned the meeting for a full day after some time

 ek vakt tha jab bollywood ke sabase antertaning actor govinda ne david dhawan ke saath sabase zyada hit filmein di thim
 But the pair's last film partner came in 2007
 film main salmaan khan bhi the jo ab ection role vaali filmon ko zyada tarjeeh de rahe hai
 But in the film Main Tera Hero, you will not miss the trio of Salman, Govinda and David Dhawan
 film main behtareen acting kar varun dhawan ne naa sirf khud ke kamedi potential ko jagajaahir kiya he, balki 90 ke dashak ke kamedi king david dhawan kii vaapasi kii raah bhi aasaan kar di he
 The film Main Tera Hero is fully loaded with romance, action and comedy
 chaahe dialog delivery kii baat ho yaa expressant kii, varun dhawan ne govinda or salmaan donon ke hi strong points ko follow kiya he
 Still not complaining to Varun, because he has also made a fool in copying and has not disappointed
 kya he film kii kahanedavid dhawan kii filmon ko dekhne kaa sirf ek hi rule he
 Leave your mind and logic at home
 yahi haal film main tera hero kaa bhi he
 However, the screenplay has justified every situation
 unti main rahane vaale shinu (varun dhawan) par filmi hero banane kaa bhoot savaar he jisase puraa shahar pareshaan he
 He arrives at a college in Bangalore to prove himself
 college main use sunaina (eliana di'krooj) se pyaar ho jaataa he
 This is where the film's first Conflict comes
 darasal police officer angad (arunoday singh) bhi sunaina ko chahta he or use ye katai pasand nahin ki sunaina college main kisi se baat bhi kare
 But this film is not Love Triangle
 isamen ek or angel he, aaysha (naragis fakhri) kaa
 The second Conflict Point in the film comes when Sunaina is kidnapped and taken to Bangkok
 sunaina kii kidnaping aaysha ke liye kii jaati he
 According to the plan, if Sheenu has to call Bangkok to Ayesha, then kidnap his girlfriend, who will come to save Sheenu
 iske aage kii kahani kya hogi iske liye dimag par jor daalane kii bhi jarurat nahin
 Because there is every possibility that your thinking will be more innovative than the climax of the film
 phir bhi david dhawan kii mindles kamedi se thodi alag he ye film
 After many such films Salman and Govinda were adopted by the audience as comic characters
 jaahir he varun ko bhi abhi lanbaa safar tay karnaa hoga
 If the purpose of this film was to establish Varun Dhawan as a comic actor, then obviously the film makers managed to do so to a great extent
 haalanki naragis fakhri ne apana role sambhaal liya, eliana di'krooj film ke liye anfit sabit huin
 sajid-wajid's music has retained the film's pace
 main ye suzav nahin duungaa ki aap is film ke liye multiplex tikat par phijulkharchi karen
 Still, if you are missing Dhawan's comedy, then watching this one time movie on DVD will be the best option

 bhartiya janata party puure sainikon kii shahadat ko unke saahas or shaury par raajnneeti kar rahi unke naam par vot batorne chaahati he'
 The same minister and former BJP MLA Vishwas Sarang, who put up this poster, says that every government has been taking credit for the actions of the soldiers
 Indira Gandhi had got the credit for liberating Bangladesh, then why our government is being questioned
 unhone kaha ki 'jab indira gandhi ne bangladesh ko aaazaad karaayaa tha tab atal bihari bajpei ne sansad main kaha tha indira gandhi durga hai
 When Indira Gandhi got her credit, who should get credit for the vigorous strike or the air strike? dilli main ek sanakee aashiq ek shaadishuda mahila se dil laga baitha

 ishrat jahaan maamle main pichhali samprag sarkaar par flip flop karne kaa aarope lagaate hue sarkaar ne aaj kaha ki aisa karnaa gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri narendra modi ko badnaam karne or fansaane kii gahari sajeesh kaa hissaa tha or maamle kii tah tak jaakar is bare main antim nirnay kiya jayega
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that the Home Ministry is investigating under which circumstances two affidavits were filed to declare Ishrat as a terrorist first and later withdraw from her
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki is maamle main kuch dastavej laapata hai
 But internal investigation is being done at the level of the ministry and all the facts are being collected after which the final decision will be reached after thought
 loksabhaa main kuch sadasyon dwaara ‘‘ishrat jahaan maamle se sabandhit shapathpatr main kathith pherbadal’’ ke bare main pesh dhyanaksharn prastaav par charchaa ke jawaab main singh ne yah baaten kahin
 He said, the previous UPA government tried to cover up the fact that Ishrat Jahan was a lashkar-e-taiba operative, though she admitted this in her first affidavit, but changed the affidavit only a month later
 tippaniyan He said the testimony of David Coleman Headley, the Mumbai terror attack conspirator, proved that Ishrat had connections to lashkar-e-taiba as was also accepted in the UPA government's earlier affidavit
 singh ne kaha ki pehle ishrat ko lashkar-e-taiyaba kaa oparative bataane vaala halafanama chah agast 2009 ko gujarat ucch nyaayalay main daakhil kiya gaya tha lekin agle maheene hi 24 sitambar ko doosraa halafanama daakhil kar use aatankwaadi maanane se inkaar kar diya gaya

 Singh said this in response to the discussion on the proposed motion presented by some members in the Lok Sabha about the "alleged alteration in the affidavit relating to Ishrat Jahan case"
 unhone kaha, pichhali samprag sarkaar ne is tathy par pardaa daalane kaa prayaas kiya ki ishrat jahaan lashkar e taiyaba oparative thi, haalanki apane pehle halfname main usne yah baat sweekaar kii thi, lekin ek maheene baad hi us halafname ko badal diya
 The comments unhone kaha ki mumbai aatanki hamale ke shadyantrakaari david colman hedli kii gavaahi se sabit ho gaya he ki ishrat ke lashkar e taiyaba se sambandh the jaisaa ki samprag sarkaar ke samay ke pehle halafname main bhi sweekaar kiya gaya tha
 Singh said that the first affidavit stating that Ishrat was operative of lashkar-e-taiba was filed in the Gujarat High Court on August 6, 2009 but the second affidavit was filed on 24 September the following month and refused to be considered a terrorist

 bhartiya janata party ke saansad or purv kendriya mantri anant kumaar hegade kaa daawa he ki maharashtra main bijepi ne fadanvis ko 40 hajaar karod kaa fund bachaane ke liye mukhyamantri banaakar drama kiya
 However, former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has denied the claim
 padhein: anant hegade ke daawey par bole devendra fadanvis- koi paisa nahin lautaaya gayaanant kumaar hegade ne kaha, 'aap sabhi jaanate hai ki maharashtra main hamaara aadmi (fadanvis) 80 ghante ke liye mukhyamantri bana or uske baad istipha de diya
 Why did they do this drama? Did we not know that we did not have a majority and still he became CM
 yah vah sawaal he jo har koi poochta he
 'read: Sanjay Raut said - sending back '40 thousand crores' with Maharashtra, Gaddarihegde said,' The CM had center funds of about 40 thousand crores
 agar congress, ensipi or shivasena satta main aate to ve 40 hajaar karod kaa durupyog karte
 This is the reason why this money of the central government could not be used for development, a drama was done for this
 'unhone kaha, 'bahut pehle se bijepi kii yah yojana thi
 Hence it was decided that there should be a play and it was under this that Fadnavis took oath as CM
 shapath lene ke 15 ghante ke andar fadanvis ne sabhi 40 hajaar karod rupayon ko us jagah par pahunchaa diya jahaan se wo aae the
 In this way, Fadnavis saved all the money by giving it back to the central government

 They are Brahmastra for every Congressman
 skool jane vaale do bacchon-13 varshiya rehaan or 11 varshiya miraya-kii maa priyanka gandhi-wadra gandhi parivaar kii sabase aakarshak sadsy hai
 He is young, charismatic and skilled in politics
 isi hafte ve apana 42waan janm din manaa rahi hai
 By the way, all these qualities should have been in Rahul Gandhi
 priyanka khud kahati hai ki brahmastra kaa ‘‘istemaal keval ek baar kiya ja saktaa he
 "but most Congress leaders, like activists, believe that there is still a great need to use Brahmastra
 bhrashtachar, aakshamata or ek ke baad ek chunaavon main haar se trast congress ke saamne vajood kaa sankat khadaa ho gaya he
 An old Congress leader says, "this is not a general election
 yah hamaare vajood kii ladaai he, ham bhavishya main sangharsh karne ke liye bache rahane vaala ravaiya nahin apana sakate
 If we lost, as is being speculated, the time to prepare for the next war would probably never come
 ’’pichley hafte ahamed patel, janardan dvivedi or madhusudan mistre jaise congress ke varisht padaadhikariyon kii dilli main hui ek baithak main priyanka kii maujuudagi se siyaasi atakalbaaji shuru ho gai ki kya ve raajnneeti main aaengi
 She is considered the most attractive person of the Gandhi family but till now she has avoided any formal political role in a big way
 haalanki isamen koi andeh nahin ki priyanka 2014 ke chunaav kii taiyaari ke saath hi apane bhai kii madad bad-chadhakar karne vaali hai
 She is active in politics and is expanding the scope of her work
 aise main congress ke saath hi vipaksh kii nazren un par hongi
 Why Priyanka is important for the party This role is not new to her
 ve hameshaa se congress main parde ke peeche rahi hai or sakriy raajnneeti se dur rahakar hi apane bhai or maa ke liye chunaav prachaar kiya he
 She has appeared with him on every important occasion, be it the case of Sonia Gandhi's rejection of Prime Minister's post in 2004 or Rahul Gandhi's confession speech at the Congress session of Jaipur in January 2013
 parivaar ke ek kareebi vyakti yaad karte hue bataate hai ki 8 march, 1988 ko siri fort main congress adhiveshan main ve apni maa ko gaadi main le jate samay unka haath thame hue thim
 "she is a very strong person and she is very effective whenever there is a crisis on the family," says a senior Congressman associated with three generations of the Gandhi family
 ’’pichley do saal main congress 16 vidhansabha chunaavon main se 12 main haar gai
 If the election experts are to be believed, then the party seems to be moving towards defeat in this year's general election
 aise main aashcharya nahin ki maayoos congress kaaryakarta apni naiya paar lagane ke liye priyanka se ummid lagaae hue hai
 She single-handedly turned the Bellary election in 1999 in favor of her mother and Sushma Swaraj had to face defeat
 unke pita ke rishtedaar arun nehru 1999 main raibareli se bijepi ke ummidavaar bane to priyanka ne hi unke khilaaf hamalaa bolaa or unhen gaiyr-vafaadaar qaraar diya
 But he did not forget that relative of his father
 pichley saal july main unki mrityu hui to priyanka ke bete rehaan ne hi unki chita ko aag lagaai
 As far as the Congress workers are concerned, they believe that they can give them an edge and their magic can work on the national stage
 lekin uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke liye chunaav prachaar karne ke baavjood ve amethi or raibareli kii 12 vidhansabha siton main keval teen main hi ve party ko jeet dilaa sakin
 Political analyst Swapna Dasgupta says, "even though they may enthuse dedicated Congress workers, this time is bad due to the strong anti-congress sentiment in the country
" ’’party bure haal main he, kaaryakarta maayoos ho chuke hai, aise main aashcharya nahin ki rahul gandhi rajnatik sujh-boojh or vichaaron ke liye apni bahan par bharosa kar rahe hai
 a leader associated with the party since the time of Indira Gandhi says, "some people have the qualities of leadership, they are included among them
" ’’ naam na chhapane ke aagrah ke saath gandhi parivaar ke ek kareebi kaa kahana he, ‘‘jab rajeev kii hatya hui thi tab 10 janpath par sabase pehle pahunchane waalon main main bhi tha
 Soniaji was very upset, although Priyanka was very young but she was very patient
 ve 10 janpath kii vyavastha sanbhaalane ke saath hi rajeev ke parthiv sharir ko shreeperumbudur se laane kii nigaraanee kar rahi thim
 He called the President and the Prime Minister to speed up the process of bringing the body
 ’’congress kii band mutthi hai priyankagandhi parivaar ke liye priyanka hameshaa se rakshak kii bhoomika main rahi hai
 Her role is such that she does not come in the lime light herself, but she deliberately backs herself up
 ve gandhi parivaar kii rathi yoddha nahin, sarathi hai jo yuddh kii ranneeti banane se lekar salaahkaar or jarurat padane par hathiyaar lekar sidhe bachaav main utarane tak har bhoomika main sakriy hoti hai
 Whenever the family is in trouble, you can see Priyanka battling in front
 1999 main jab sonia gandhi ek saath amethi or karnataka ke bellari main loksabhaa chunaav lard rahi thim or sushamaa ne kannada main bhaashan dekar sari chunavi mehfilein lut lee thim, tab congress ne priyanka ko yaad kiya or phir priyanka ne bellari ko ek din ke tufaani road sho se jis tarah fatah kar liya, vah congress ke rajnatik itihaas kaa avismaraneey kshan ban gaya
 Priyanka Gandhi is also the capital of the Congress due to her stable mind and undisputed personality
 pati robert wadra kii tarah charchaaon main rahanaa unhen sweekaarya nahin he
 Her name is not included in any economic transaction involving her husband
 aaj tak unka koi aisa bayaan nahin aayaa he jinase yah lagata ho ki desh ke sabase mahatvapurn rajnatik parivaar kaa sadsy hone ke naate ve kisi pad ko chaahati hai
 Rather, she has repeatedly said that she will not enter politics and her aim is only to serve the people and the party
 amethi or raibareli main apane prachaar ke dauraan unhen garibon-daliton or alpsankhyakon ke saath behad sahaj hokar milte-julate dekha ja saktaa he
 When Indira Gandhi meets 45-year-old Kalavati living in Dhakalganj village of Shivgarh block of Aksaraibreli, she leaves all work and sits down to tell stories about Priyanka Gandhi
 kalavati kaa us vakt aashcharya kaa thikaana nahin tha jab 18 november kii dopaher khet main dhan katate vakt achaanak priyanka gandhi unke khet main pahunch gayi thim
 Kalavati gave Priyanka her sickle and taught her how to cut paddy
 priyanka kalavati or gaanv kii kuch mahilaon ke saath khet main kareeb aadha ghanta bitaakar waapas lautne lageen to gaadi par baithne se pehle ek gramin ramtahal maury ne unhen roak liya
 Said, "bitiya listen to a song
 is par priyanka gaadi se utar ain or unka geet suna
 Ramthal recited the song, "I wave Sonia ji's subachai dueria, keep an eye on everyone's paw, Rajiv, Indira sit in heaven lost the whole world
" ’’ geet sunakar priyanka bhavuk huin or gramin ko dhanyavad dete hue aage bad gayi
 The way Priyanka Gandhi met people in her mother's parliamentary constituency keeping aside all the security frills, she answered all the reasons why people are looking at her grandmother Indira Gandhi's image in Priyanka
 aktubar maheene main elahabaad shahar congress ne lok sabha chunaav main pandit jawaharlal nehru kii karmbhumi phulpur sansadeey kshetra se priyanka gandhi ko ummidavaar banaae jane kii maang kaa prastaav paarit kar siyasat main garmahat paidaa kar di
 After this, city Congress secretary Haseeb Ahmed and Youth Congress member Srischandra Dubey raised a new controversy by demanding that Priyanka Gandhi be made a candidate by putting a hoarding in the civil lines, calling Sonia Gandhi sick
