 iske baad amit ko yah mauka mila jinhone ise donon haathon se pakad liya

 bihar ke purv siem nitish kumaar kii sampark yatra kaa asar party ke kaaryakartaaon par dikhe naa dikhe, mahagathbandhan par jarur dikhne laga he
 Bihar Congress President Ashok Chaudhary said that Nitish Kumar should be the face of this grand alliance
 bihar main samaajwaadiyon ke naam se parhez karne vaali congress ko ab nitish kumaar main hi bhavishya najar aane laga he
 This is the reason why the Congress has made its stand clear on who should be the face in the coalition
 jis nitish kumaar se congress ko parhez tha, jo congress nitish kumaar ko phooti aankh nahin suhaati thi, usee congress or nitish kaa pyaar kuch is kadar paravaan chadha he ki bihar main argedy-jedy(you) or congress kaa cheharaa koun ho, isapar jedy(you) se pehle, congress ne hi apane pattey khol die hai
 Nitish Kumar is currently on Sampark Yatra in the state but the Congress party is raising the flag in Patna in his name
 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh ashok choudhary ne 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki nitish kumaar ko hi gathbandhan kaa cheharaa hona chahie
 Ashok Chaudhary says, 'this grand alliance has to move forward with one face
 aakhri faisla to teenon partiyon ke netaaon ko karnaa he lekin ye sachai he ki nitish kumaar hi wo cheharaa he jo rajya main sabase bharosemand he or jise bihar main or centre main kaam karne kaa acha anubhav he
 Also, Nitish Kumar's 8-year tenure as Chief Minister has been good
 aise main ham chahenge ki nitish kumaar hi is mahagathabandhan kaa cheharaa hon
 According to Ashok Chaudhary, Lalu Yadav has the image of a big leader in entire Bihar and his 'pan Bihar' appeal, but now he cannot be pursued because he has a legal hurdle
 aise main nitish kumaar hi wo cheharaa he jisapar ye gathbandhan daanv laga saktaa he
 Chaudhary said that Nitish Kumar as chief minister has done a good job for the state, in such a situation that Modi's chariot can be stopped in Bihar only if he will be the face of the grand alliance
 baharhaal congress kii bhoomika kya sirf modi ke rath ko rokane kii hogi yaa phir is gathbandhan ke pichhalggu party kii hogi, is par bolte hue bihar congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki party kii bhoomika pehle modi ke vijay rath ko rokane kii he
 The selfishness of such a party comes later
 bihar main nitish ko congress kaa saath milane se unke hausale buland honge lekin kya lalu or argedy itani aasaani se nitish ko netaa maanegi ye sabase bada sawaal hoga

 Digvijay said this on a question about the US agency CIA describing Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad as militant organization and RSS as nationalist organization
 haal main digvijay singh ne daawa kiya tha ki vah hameshaa 'sanghee aatankwaad ke khilaaf bolte rahe hai na ki hindu aatankwaad ke bare main
 'congress President Rahul Gandhi is facing a defamation case on the statement that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is behind the killing of Mahatma Gandhi

 The Congress has not been able to get out of the controversy that Digvijay Singh has now given such a statement which can be disputed
 gauratlab he ki iske pehle bhi digvijay singh sangh or bijepi ke bare main kai vivaadit bayanon ke liye jane jate rahe hai

 In the 70s, when the star of the cinema was changing the equation, Vinod Khanna's entry was identified as a hero whose stature is reflected in his stature and seductive smile

 Dharmendra was the only man, then Shashi Kapoor, the most beautiful hero of that era
 lekin vinod khanna kii khubsuurati ke saath unke andaaj main baat koi gajab thi
 In 1968, when the first film, Man Ka Meet Aaye, was followed by a queue of producers
 tab ek hafte main hi 15 filmein sin kar lee thi vinod khanna ne
 One of those 15 films was Mera Gaon Mera Desh
 jisamen nibhaayaa daaku jabbar singh kaa kirdaar unhen film se bhi zyada mashhoor kar gaya

 But even today the proceedings of the Lok Sabha were adjourned till tomorrow, due to which no motion of no confidence could be brought
 magar, is bich shivasena ne bada elaan kiya he
 The Shiv Sena has decided not to participate in voting on the proposal
 yani avishvaas prastaav aane shivasena modi sarkaar kaa bachaav nahin karegi
 In fact, both ministers at the Center resigned from Chandrababu Naidu's TDP quota on Andhra Pradesh for not granting special state status
 iske baad se wo lagaataar sansad main modi sarkaar kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Now when the TDP prepared to bring a no-confidence motion against the Modi government, it also got the support of several parties including the Congress, RJD and the Left, including the opposition YSR Congress
 ye he sadan kaa samikarbais vakt loksabhaa main kul 539 sadsy hai
 In this context, the majority figure is 270

 lekin bijepi ke 274 ke aankade main teen pench bhi hai
 Shatrughan Sinha, Kirti Azad and Shyamcharan Gupta are the three BJP mps who are seen standing against the party on almost every front
 aise main agar ye teenon voting main shaamil nahin hote or inke alaava ek or vot idhar udhar hua to phir bijepi ko sahyogi dalon kaa munh dekhnaa pad saktaa he
 TDP and YSR Congress have given notice to bring a no-confidence motion in Lok Sabha for the motion of no confidence
 maujuuda sthiti main avishvaas prastaav pesh karne ke liye kam se kam 50 saansadon kaa samarthan hasil hona chahie
 Which TDP has achieved
 avishvaas prastaav ko congress, tiemasi, espi, argedy ke alaava left partiyon samet duusare bijepi virdohi dalon ne bhi samarthan dene kaa elaan kar diya he
 However, the government is confident that this proposal will fall easily
 avishvaas prastaav ke paksh main votwasar congress- 09tidipi- 16congress- 48tiemasi- 34sapa- 07argedy- 04left- 11yani maujuuda sthiti main avishvaas prastaav ke paksh main kai vipakshi dalon ke 129 saansad khadey najar aa rahe hai
 However, the BJD has not supported this proposal
 sarkaar ko sankat nahivishwaas prastaav aane ke baavjood bijepi ko kisi tarah kaa koi sankat nahin he
 He has the necessary majority in the Lok Sabha to run the government
 bijepi- 274shivasena- 18algepi- 06akali dal- 04araspi- 03jediu- 02anya- 07endie ke saansadon kii sankhya philhal 314 he
 But the Shiv Sena has distanced itself from voting
 aise main sarkaar chalaane main to modi ko koi sankat nahin aane vaala he
 The government is confident of dropping the no-confidence motion due to sufficient numbers, but this resentment of the allies has emerged as a setback for the current government

 On one hand, BJP is trying to make a dent in Chandrababu Naidu's Telugu Desam Party (TDP), while on the other hand the ruling YSR Congress chief and Chief Minister Jagan Mohan are being siege on religion
 jagan mohan ke isai hone kaa mudda bhi uthaaya ja rahaa he
 Recently, 60 TDP leaders have joined the party in the presence of BJP acting president JP Nadda, who arrived in Hyderabad

 BJP national secretary and Andhra Pradesh co-incharge Sunil Deodhar shared a video on August 20 claiming that Chief Minister Jagan Mohan was refusing to light the lamp
 haalanki unhone yah nahin bataaya ki video kahaan kaa he or kab kaa he
 After his tweet, BJP supporters started to condemn Jagan Mohan as opposed to Hindu beliefs
 isse purv jagan mohan ne jab apane chachaa or party ke varisht netaa vivi subba reddy ko chairman niyukt kiya tha tab bhi bijepi ke kuch netaaon or samarthakon kii ore se iskaa virodh kiya gaya tha
 During that time it was said that Jagan Mohan has done the work of hurting the feelings by making his Christian preacher uncle the chairman of Tirupati temple trust

 gauratlab he ki 11 sitambar ke hamalon ke baad al jawahiri bhi bhumigat he or vah america ke pramukh nishaanon main se ek he
 "many Al Qaeda leaders arrested have shown that all al Qaeda members appreciated Osama's dominance as the sole leader of the organization and had maintained better relations with all but Al Jawahiri," the official said
 The brightness is very less within the organization and is not much respected either
 osama ke samarthakon kaa vishwaas jeetne ke liye use kadi mashkkat kerani hogi

 Gandhi said, 'because the leaders of this region are losing the trust and credibility of the people, there is a danger that violence may replace traditional democratic leadership
 ’mahatma gandhi ke pote gopal krishna ne kaha, ‘dakshin asia main kai aise netaa hai jinaki raajnneeti main paariwarik prishthbhumi rahi he phir bhi mahatma gandhi or jawahar laal nehru apane balboote netaa bane the

 All political parties talked a lot about minorities, but no one has taken seriously their real issues (education, economic-social development and women empowerment) nor does their development seem to have any concern with anyone
 alpsankhyak or khaskar musalamaanon kii sabase badi hamdard hone kaa daawa karne vaali congress ko hi len
 Be it a matter of reservation or educational backwardness or discrimination on religious grounds with Muslims and Christians since 1950 under Section 341 of the Constitution
 is mudde par pichley chaar saal se supreme court main affidavit file karne main taal-matol kii gai
 During the election, it was resolved to abolish the 341 discrimination in the name of the Action Plan (also called the Congress's sub-manifesto)
 isi tarah se musalamaanon ke liye 4
 There was talk of 5 per cent 'quota within quota'
 yah bhi sach he ki us par khud congress kii rajya sarkaron ne pichley das saal main koi khaas kadam nahin uthaaya
 Yes, this issue is definitely hot during the elections
 supreme court ne kaha ki bagaiyr taiyaari ke is tarah ke aarakshan kii baat nahin kii ja sakati
 And it is not that the Congress is not aware of this
 karnataka main is formule par pahunchane ke liye jo kaam karne the, vah soobe kii congress sarkaar ne kiye the or vahaan musalamaanon ko bagaiyr kisi roak-tok ke ‘cote ke bheetar kota’ mila hua he
 Similarly, take the order of Waqf property under Indira Gandhi's government occupation of 40 years ago
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki desh kii vakf sampatti jo centre yaa rajya kisi bhi sarkaar ke kabje main hogi, yaa to use vakf board ko waapas kar diya jayega yaa phir maujuuda market rate par board ko iskaa kiraaya diya jayega
 But till date it could not be implemented
 aise hi kai or mudde hai, jinke liye sirf congress ko hi jimmedaar mana jaataa he ki use musalamaanon ke mudde chunaavon ke samay hi yaad aate hai
 Now the matter of Samajwadi Party (SP)
 2012 ke uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main sapa ko baari bahumat milane ke baad party pramukh kii ore se kaha gaya ki unhen musalamaanon ke shat-pratishat vot mili, jabaki yah bhi sach he ki musalamaanon ne tactical voting karte hue bispi, congress, areldi or duusari partiyon ko bhi samarthan diya tha
 The SP had made a lot of promises to Muslims in its manifesto, but the Akhilesh government did not take positive steps in this direction
 yahaan tak ki alpsankhyak ayog, urdu academy or fakhruddin cameti jaisi alpsankhyakon se judi sanvaidhanik sansthaaon kaa gathan bhi court ke aadesh ke baad kiya gaya
 The SP also ignored its order of participation of Muslims in government committees
 aarakshan kii to baat hi choden
 The assurance of 18 per cent Muslim reservation was also an election lollipop, and the SP chief does not even listen to the 'quota within quota'
 soobe ke musalamaanon ko apane samaaj ke vikaas kii jagah par sau se zyada bhayaavah dangon kaa dansh jhelana padaa
 Yet he appears to be a friend of Muslims and the biggest contender for Muslim votes
 bispi ko lijie
 It had a big chance to re-emerge in Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan kaa muslim samaaj usase sakaaratmak sanket kaa intjaar karata hi rahaa lekin vah bhi musalamaanon ke asal muddon par baat karne se kataraati he
 In Bihar too, in the fight for secularism and communalism, the real issues of Muslims were not seen anywhere
 muslim-yadav sameekaran kaa phayda lalu prasad ke parivaar or yadav netaaon ko to hua lekin muslim samudaay upekshit hi rahaa
 At the same time, the attitude of NCP, the second ally of Congress, is peculiar
 sharad pavaar jaise netaa narendra modi ko clin chit dene main koi sankoch nahin karte, jabaki abhi to modi nyaay ke pehle paaydaan par hai
 Right now they have to go through the thresholds of the High Court and the Supreme Court to prove themselves innocent
 muslim voton par najar rakhte hue ve apane or prafull patel ke bayaan par kalabaziyaan khate dikhte hai
 Even on their part, the real issues of Muslims do not seem serious
 desh ke baaki hisson par najar daalen to sirf pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee hi musalamaanon ke muddon ko lekar sanjeeda najar aati hai
 It remains to be seen whether this seriousness will be permanent or will an agreement be reached on some occasion
 is chunaav kaa takalifdeh pahalu yah bhi he ki desh kii ganga-jamuni tahjeeb or hajaaron saal kii sabhyataa ko taar-taar karne kii harchand koshish ho rahi he, or yahaan bhi musalmaan akelaa hi khadaa he jabaki vah desh kaa abhinn hissaa he
 Where every fifth person belongs to minority community and eighth person is Muslim, how can you take the country to the heights by ignoring it
 aam deshavaasiyon kii tarah musalamaanon ke bhi kuch asal or kuch bhaavnaatmak mudde hai
 The real issues include Muslim society's educational background, amu's scheme to open centers across the country, social and economic planning, women empowerment, better management of Waqf properties and administrative discrimination
 iske saath kuch khaas imotional mudde jaise babari masjid, muslim personal lau or naujavaanon kii gaiyr-kanoonee hiraasat hai
 Whichever government comes, it will not be able to play an important role in this country unless it takes seriously the real issues of Muslim society

 dilli ke purv mantri kapil mishra aam aadmi party netaa kumaar vishwaas se milane unke ghar pahunche
 Upon reaching here, Kapil called Kumar Vishwas
 kapil ne kaha ki jab kumaar se mulaakaat nahin hogi, tab tak wo daravaaje se nahin hatenge
 The demand sheet pasted on the door, Mishra also opened a front against Kumar Vishwas
 unhone kumaar vishwaas ke ghar ke daravaaje par maang patr hi chipka diya
 In fact, Kapil claimed to have given Vishwas the evidence of the scandals of Satyendra Jain
 yahi saboot saunpane ke liye wo kumaar vishwaas ke ghar pahunche the
 When they did not meet there, Kapil called Kumar
 vahiin duusari taraf kapil ne party va sarkaar ke andar hue ghotaalon par chup baithe netaaon or vidhayakon se kai sawaal kiye
 Kapil Mishra posed 9 questions to Aam Aadmi Party mlas and leaders
 1
 The resignation of the 10 Union Ministers whom we all asked for in the Anna movement, was it a jumla spoken only to gain power? 2
 kyashila dikshithor congress ke anya netaaon or mantriyon ke khilaaf saboot aapane apni ankhon se dekhe the, istipha maangane se pehle?3
 If you had seen, then why was there silence on those evidences for two and a half years, then why was all that spectacle done? Did the people of Delhi lie to you? 4
 kya aapane arvind kejariwal se kabhi poocha ki shila dikshit ke khilaaf jo saboot the un sabooton kaa kejariwal ne kya kiya?5
 Just like i am registering a case in every case of corruption in ACB, CBI, could not Kejriwal do the same? Or put all the evidence on the internet and make it public
 kis majaburi main aisa nahin kiya gaya?6
 Have you bothered to look at all the evidence that i put on the internet, whether fake bills of Bansal family or PWD, benami property or hawala, ambulance scam or high security number plate, are surfacing today? 7
 jayeesim ahamed khanko ek minute kii audio clip par hataaya gaya
 Has the party's principles and rules changed since then? Are there separate rules for Aseem and separate rules for Satyendra and Kejriwal? 8
 kya congress ke netaaon ne aapaki bhens churaai thi, kya congress se ladane kaa koi or agenda tha, kya apane ghar ke andar hone vaale bhrashtachar ke liye chuppi rakhane ke liye ye andolan hua tha?9
 Is this the "small and cottage industry" of silence on scams and fighting the elections here and there? The direction of the party? Kapil asked the party workers not only these nine questions but also asked them to answer them
 kapil ne likhaa ki wo in sawaalon ke jawaab kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Please tell that after Kapil Mishra was removed from the cabinet, he accused Arvind Kejriwal of taking two crore cash from Satyendra Jain
 iske baad kapil ne arvind kejariwal par farji companiyaan banavaakar hawala ke jariye blike mani ko white karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 At the same time, in Delhi's 400 crore water tanker scam, the role of Kejriwal and his two close friends was questioned
 kapil ne apane in aaropon ke aadhaar par asibi or sibiai main cese bhi darj karaae hai
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that as an 'important leader' he honors social activist Anna Hazare who has done a great job in the field of rural development and the whole nation appreciates him

 Great batsman Sunil Gavaskar was pulled by the International Cricket Council for not punishing Australian captain Steven Smith
 steve smith ne bharat ke khilaaf duusare test ke dauraan diares raferal lene ke liye dressing room kaa ishaara maanga tha jo niyamon ke khilaaf he
 Gavaskar said that he would love to see Indian captain Virat Kohli take help from the dressing room while taking DRS in the next Test in Ranchi and he did not get punishment
 gavaskar ne kaha ki aisa nahin ho saktaa ki kuch deshon ko pakshpaati vyavhaar mili jabaki kuch deshon ke khilaaf vyavhaar kiya jaye
 He said that if an Indian player asks for advice in a bracing manner, he should not be punished
 gavaskar ne kaha ki main chaahunga ki tisare test main agar viraat kohli ko out diya jaataa he or vah diares lene ke liye bhartiya dressing room kii ore dekhe or use unase kisi bhi tarah kii pratikriya mili
 Yes or No, whatever the sign
 dekhte hai ki tab match referi or isisi kya faisla karte hai
 The ICC had earlier decided not to press charges against Smith and Indian captain Kohli
 is ghatana se bada vivaad khadaa ho gaya he jisamen sabandhit board, bisisiai or cricket austrailia apane captainon kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 Gavaskar said that ICC Match Referee Chris Board did not find anything wrong in seeking Smith's gesture
 unhone kaha, broad ne kuch nahin dekha ki smith ne isisi kii aachaar samhita kaa ullaghann kiya tha

 Today we will take you with us on the path of death
 us raste par, jahaan har kadam par maut apane pankh failaae khadi he
 Waiting when the footsteps of the walker will wobble and when he should cover it in his lap
 hamaara daawa he ki is raste par chalane kii himmat karnaa to dur, ise dekh kar hi aapaki ruh kaanp jaaegi, lekin phir bhi log chalane ko majaboor hai
 Knowing that every step taken on this path is the step of death
 saikadon feet kii oonchai par rail kii patariyon ke bich maut kaa khel jari he
 With each step the heartbeat increases
 har guzarati train ke saath zindagi kii res jari he
 Some carry a bicycle, some are empty handed, some are on this journey with their bags
 madhya pradesh ke siwani jile ke candipaar gaanv ke logon kii yahi niyati he, yahi taqadir he
 As the rainy season begins, the only rough road connecting this village to the nearby town is lost in the mud, whether it is impossible to pass through this road, whether by car and on foot
 or bas isi vajah se har saal candipaar ke log isi tarah jaan hatheli par lekar maut kaa ye pul paar karte hai
 The residents of Kandipar have to go through three such bridges of death every day, not one
 is imtehaan main wo paas ho gaye to thik, lekin fail hue to sirf or sirf ek hi nateeja or wo he maut
 By the way, all the people of this village are not so happy about the examination of the bridges
 kuch aise bhi hai, jo pul ke upar se nikle to the manzil kii talash main, lekin peeche se aati train ne unhen kahin or pahunchaa diya
 Where does this path of death finally end? Where this path ends, the fear does not end by reaching the place, but increases further, because with the elimination of this path, a more dangerous game of death begins
 haadase kaa shikaar noujvaan govind surya ne kaha, 'main pul se guzar rahaa tha
 The train arrived
 hadabdaahat main neeche gir gaya
 Spine broken
 candipaar kii nivasee shilavati kaa kahana he ki sahab, dhad-dhad hovat he, jab tak baccha nahin aavat
 According to Shraddha Inawati, a resident of Kandipar school, when the train arrives, i run out
 mushkil ek, dard alag-alagaye dard he us noujvaan kaa jo zindagi or maut kii res main apni baazi haar gaya
 Luckily, life was saved, but life was not worth living
 ek dar he us maa kaa, jo har rose hazaar mannaton ke baad apane kaleje ke tukdon ko taiyaar kar skool to bhejti he, lekin jab tak bachche laut kar ghar nahin aate, tab tak nigahen darvaaze se hatati nahin he
 One is the trouble of that little doll, who has to play life and death every day to go to school
 qadam patari par, jaan hatheli paramadhya pradesh ke siwani zile ke is gaanv candipaar ke bashindon ke paas doosraa koi chaara bhi nahin he
 Once it has not rained, the only raw road going out of the village is unable to run and then the whole village has to pass through three railway bridges on top of it, for every task, with life on the palm
 magar, dhaddhadati rail gadiyon ke bich rozaana maut se do-do haath karte ye bhole-bhaale gaanvvaale har rose khushkismat nahin hote
 Once someone who fails in this examination, understand that his life itself is forever angry
 yun ruuth gai govind kii qismaub noujvaan govind surya ko hi lijie
 Some eight years ago, Govind was going to school like this from the Railway Police
 lekin bich raste main jo kuch hua, wo govind ke liye kabhi khatm hone vaala dard ban kar rah gaya
 Back in the back, innocent Govind had just reached the middle of the bridge that suddenly the train came from the front
 ab naa to wo peeche laut saktaa tha or naa hi aage bad saktaa tha
 For a while, Govind's breath stopped and the next moment he fell straight down from the top of the bridge
 govind ke ridh kii haddi tut gai or wo nadi ke bich hi behosh ho gaya
 Death on track, life on track survived Govind's life, but all parts of his body still do not work properly
 padhai chhot gai or wo zindagi khud par boj ban gai
 This story is not about Govind alone, except for Govind, who has been the victim of these bridges
 is gaanv kii ek bujurg mahila to train kii takkar ke baad apni jaan se hi chali gai, jabaki ek garbhvatee mahila ne dehshat ke maare patari ke bagal main hi apane bachche ko janm diya
 Despite this, neither the villagers have got a permanent paved road nor their fate opened till now
 paanch kilometre kii ek sadak banane main kitne din lagate hai? ek maheenaa do maheenaa yaa saal do saal? lekin hamaare desh main itani hi lambaai kii ek sadak aisi he, jo pichley 66 saalon main nahin ban saki
 So those who had to pass through this road, they tie the shroud on the head every day and travel
 paanch kilometre, 66 salpanch kilometre kaa ye ek aisa faaslaa he jise pichley 66 saalon main bhi ham paat naa paae
 All the leaders of the country, bureaucrats, Khudmukhtar and Bayan Bahadur together could not even give the route of five kilometers to this village in the last 66 years
 wo rasta jisapar jisapar jindagi bekhauf apane kadam badhaati
 And just because of this lack, the people of this village are forced to go through the path of death on the palm of their life every four months
 agar is gaanv ko unka paanch kilometre lanbaa rasta mil jaataa to naa to barish main ye sadak yun keechad main gum ho jaati or naa hi naa hi is sadak se bachane ke liye yahaan ke bashindon ko maut ko chhu kar nikalnaa padataa
 But, sorry
 candipaar gaanv kaa yahi sach he
 The villagers have not made every effort that the people of this village have not tried to complete this five kilometer gap
 lekin har baar unki koshish netaaon ke jhuthe vaadon or sarkari daftaron kii filon main gum hoti rahi
 Once the late Congress MLA of this area even said that since the people of his village disappointed him by not voting, now they will disappoint the villagers by not making the road
 ye to rahi vidhayak kii baat, duusare netaa bhi gaanvvaalon ko goli dene main peeche nahin rahe
 When Aaj Tak spoke to the Congress in this regard, he put the entire head of the BJP at bay
 empisisi ke sadsy rajkumaar khurana ne kaha das saalon se bijepi kaa shashan he
 They should pay attention
 jabaki bijepi ke paas is gaanv kii badakismati ko lekar alag hi daleel he
 BJP leader Naresh Diwakar said that this work should have been done at the gram panchayat level itself
 vaise kasoor sirf siyasatdanon kaa hi nahin he, naukashahon ko bhi jaise candipaar kii kismat badalane ke liye kisi bade haadase kaa intazaar he
 Seoni DM Bharat Yadav says, 'road will be built next year under PMSY
 '
 
 
 What is the matter, what about the matter? Here the DM Sahib is giving the comfort of the next year, but for the last 66 years, the experience of the villagers is that this console, these promises and these claims are nothing but manipulation 
 ab to bas candipaar ko duaon kii darkaar he, jisase kisi haadase se pehle paanch kilometre kii pakki sadak kii surat main logon ko zindagi kii guarantee mil jaae
 a man died in the Mandavali area of east Delhi due to a cutrain
 chashmadidon ke mutabikmritak kaan main yearphone daalkar trek paar kar rahaa thajiske chalate use train kaa horn sunai hinahin diya
 However, police said that they did not receive any earphones or mobiles from the scene
 police adhikari ne bataaya ‘mobile se hamen vyakti kii pahchaan kaa pataa lagane main madad mil sakati thi lekin mritak ke paas se koi pahchaan patr yaa dastavej nahin mili hai
 The deceased has not been identified yet
 police ke mutabik uski umr 30 saal ke aas-paas thi
 Input from language loksabhaa chunaavon main mili haar kaa thikra phodne ke liye aakhirkaar congress party ko ek majboot sir mil hi gaya
 The party has directly blamed its Japanese ad agency Dentsu for falling flat on its face in these elections
 congressi diggajon ne kaha ki japan kii is aid agency ke kaaran hi party ko in chunaavon main munh kii khaani padi
 Significantly, the Congress had hired this agency for about 600 crores to shine its crown prince Rahul Gandhi, but the result is in front of you all
 congress ke aid agency ke abhiyaan bijepi ke abhiyaan ke saamne kahin tik nahin paae
 a senior Congress leader said that Dentsu cannot keep itself apart from the crushing defeat in these elections
 iske liye yahi doshi he
 Enormous money was shed like water
 chaahe wo criation main ho yaa phir vigyaapan baantne main, lekin sab kuch pani main hi chalaa gaya
 The party's party could not be formed in these elections
 haalanki dentsu ke bharat ke pravaktaa ne congressiyon ke in aaropon ke sire se khaarij kiya he
 He says that transparency has been exercised in our entire work
 kahin koi paisa betaratib tareeke se nahin kharch kiya gaya
 Every penny has been used in a proper way
 bataaya jaataa he ki dentsu ke aalaa adhikari rohit ohari se in muddon par kangesi netaa ajay maakan se tikhi bahes bhi ho chuki he
 However, when we tried to talk to Ajay Maken, there was no response from him
 dentsu ke pravaktaa ne bhi maakan or ohari ke bich hui tikhi bahes ke babat kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya

 bhopal ke gunahagaar warren anderson ko bhagane main divangat pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi kii bhoomika par bhi sawaal uth rahe hai
 Rajiv Gandhi has been targeted by none other than PC Alexander, who was his principal secretary
 elexander ne kaha he ki anderson ko chhodane kaa faisla rajeev gandhi kaa tha
 Rajiv Gandhi was probably under pressure
 unhone yah bhi khulaasa kiya ki is maamle main rajeev gandhi or arjuna singh ek-duusare ke sampark main the
 In this regard, the officials were kept in the lurch
 baharhaal, anderson maamle main rajeev gandhi kaa naam saamne aane ke baad is vivaad ke or jor pakadaney kii ashanka he
 a full house, on the wall outside the house were written the names of ten children, first five names of boys of the house and the remaining five names of girls and then one night there are five slaughtered together in that house
 yah katl unheen paanch ladakiyon ke hote hai, jinke naam diwaar par likhe the
 After this, the police get involved in the investigation, but the puzzle of the murder and the murderer was hidden in the names written on the same wall
 kaatil upar se shuru pehle paanch naamon ko choota tak nahin, kyonki upar likhe paanch ladakon ke naam main se ek bhi ghar par nahin the
 The names of the five remaining girls, who were murdered that night, and none of these five were real sisters
 nau se 17 saal kii umr kii paanch sagi bahanen, ek hi ghar ke paanch kamaron main akeli so rahi thim or paanchon ko kaatil unke kamare main ja-jaakar goliyaan martha he
 That is, whatever the murderer was, he had no meaning with the men or boys of the house
 wo sirf ladakiyon kii jaan lene gaya tha
 Now the puzzle is that why did the murderer kill only the girls? Who was that This thing or question itself was shocking, why did the murderer target only the girls? After all, what hostility did he have with only girls? While he did not touch the other members of the house sleeping outside the same house, the surprising thing was that neither saw the murderer coming nor going
 yahaan tak ki kisi ne raat ke sannaate ke baavjood goliyon kii aawaaj tak nahin suni, lekin subah jaise hi gharavaalon ko ek saath paanch bahanon ke katl kaa pataa chalaa, puure gaanv main matam pasar gaya
 The sound of shouts and cries and cries made the sky melt as well
 vaardaat purv faujee pien singh ke ghar hui thi
 He had a whole family full of three sons and eleven grandchildren, but last night something happened that the daughters of this family, not a single granddaughter of PN Singh survived, but surprisingly no other members of the house especially all the boys of all His hair also did not stop
 police har pahalu se maamle kii tafteesh kar rahi thi
 During the same investigation, the police themselves told the family that they had old enmity with the neighbors
 yani unhone sara shaq padosiyon par jataa diya par kuch baaten aisi thim, jo police ke gale nahin utar rahi thi
 For example, on the night of the incident, all the men of the house go out of the house and leave the five sisters alone
 ghar par pahunchane ke saath hi police ko ek aisi baat pataa chali, jise sun kar vardiwaalon ke kadam thithak gaye
 It was found that in the house where these girls were murdered in PN Singh, no other member of this family was present except the elderly PN Singh
 yani ghar ke sabhi ke sabhi log or khaskar tamaam ladke kahin baahar gaye hue the
 As the investigation progressed, it was found that the three sons of PN Singh had gone to the police station to write a report of molestation against a family living in their neighborhood along with the women of the house, while all the six brothers of the girls who were victims of the crime were sleeping in the neighbor's house
 Were
 tafteesh ke dauraan ye bhi saaf ho hua ki jis makaan main ghus kar kaatil ne ladakiyon ko nishaanaa banaaya, us makaan main kisi ke jabaran daakhil hone kaa koi bhi subut nahin mila
 That is, at first glance, it seemed that the murderer was someone who was well aware of this family and hence he had no problem in entering here in the dark of night
 ain vaardaat kii raat is ghar ke baaki sadasyon kaa bhi ghar se baahar rahanaa kuch kam ajeeb nahin tha
 The sleeping of all the boys of the house at the neighbor's house was also suspicious
 ek gaur karanevaali baat ye bhi thi ki jis ghar main paanch-paanch ladakiyon kaa katl kiya gaya, usee ghar ke baraamde par ladakiyon ke dada or purv faujee bujurg pien singh bhi so rahe the, lekin naa to unhen is vaardaat kii koi bhanak hui or naa hi kaatil ne un par koi hamalaa hi kiya
 The question was also, who sent the boys to sleep in the neighbors 'house, while the girls were asked to sleep alone in their respective rooms? So are the families out, the boys sleeping in the neighbors' house and the murderer's house Was it a coincidence to simply enter? Or were these things directly related to this incident of five to five murders? Apparently, after reaching the occasion, the police too got entangled in answering these questions for some time
 aise main pulisavaalon ne sach pataa karne ke liye tafteesh aage badhaane kaa faisla kiya, lekin jaise hi pulisavaalon ne pien singh ke beton yani ladakiyon ke pitaaon se iske bare main poochtacha shuru kii, unhen ek nai baat pataa chali
 In fact, all the people of this family were calling the same family living in their neighborhood as murderers of these girls, who were having old animosity about their property and property, with the intention of writing a report of molestation against that family
 Last night, all the people of PN Singh's house had gone to the police station, but one thing was very strange in the matter of blaming the neighbors
 wo ye ki is ghar ke log apane dushmano par vaardaat ko anjaam dene kaa shaq jaahir nahin kar rahe the, balki puure yakeen ke saath naa sirf unhen hi bacchiyon ko kaatil bataa rahe the, balki turant giraftaar kar jail bhejne kii bhi maang kar rahe the par police ne kisi bhi nattejey par pahunchane se pehle ek or tarkeeb aajamaane kaa faisla kiya or jaise hi ye tarkeeb aajamaai gai, asli kaatil kaa cheharaa benakaab hone laga
 As the investigation was progressing, the housemates themselves were coming under suspicion, but till now the police had only doubts about them
 is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin ki aakhir khud ghar vaale apni hi paanch-paanch betiyon ko kyon maut ke ghat utaarenge? par phir wo sach bhi saamne aa gaya
 Daughters should not become a burden when they grow up, just because their own people killed them
 ab police ne vaardaat ke vakt singh parivaar ke tamaam sadasyon kii maujuudagi yani lokation ke bare main pataa karnaa shuru kar diya
 During interrogation, most of the adult members of the house admitted that last night they had gone to the police station to file a complaint against a family living in the neighborhood while the children were sleeping in the houses, but if the police could believe these statements, then What would the investigation do? So, he started to know about the location of the family members and especially the elderly PN Singh's three sons Shashi, Bharat and Vipin from their mobile phone last night
 is koshish main shashi or bharat ke mobile phone ke lokation to takreeban vahi nikle, jahaan wo bataa rahe the
 But surprisingly, Vipin's location was not where he was talking about being himself last night
 balki uskaa mobile phone to kuch or hi kahani bayaan kar rahaa tha
 According to the police, Vipin was present in the village from 7
45 in the evening to 2
35 in the night
 yani uske mobile phone kaa tower lokation vahi sho kar rahaa tha, jo aam taur par is gaanv ke active mobile phone ke tower kaa hota he
 While Vipin was telling himself to be away from the village till now
 saaf tha ki kuch aisa jarur tha, jo vipin police se chhipaane kii koshish kar rahaa tha, lekin abhi police vipin se kaayade se poochtacha kar paati, wo shmashaan ghat se hi behad rahasyamayi tareeke se kahin gaayab ho gaya
 Although the police was suspicious of the families of Maktool girls from the beginning, due to the condition of the incident and the family, but the disappearance of Vipin further cemented his suspicions
 udhar, gharavaalon ke dabaav par police unke dushman parivaar ke kuch logon ko pehle hi is silsile main giraftaar kar liya tha par lekin ab police ke jaanch kii disha takreeban saaf ho chuki thi or is vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke makasad se bhi pardaa hat chukaa tha
 During the investigation, the police came to know that the family members of PN Singh had hatched a conspiracy to hide their enemy family and the absconding Vipin had allegedly told his family members to just see how they could see all their Sends all the enemies to the gallows, but after this he will kill his own niece and daughters
 ye kisi ne bhi nahin sochaa tha
 According to the police, Vipin wanted to fulfill two objectives simultaneously by doing so
 awwal to dushmano ko sabak sikhaanaa or doosraa dushmano ke bahaane dhire-dhire jawan ho rahi betiyon se chhutkaaraa paanaa
 At present, the police are waiting for Vipin who is absconding in this case and he says that after the arrest of Vipin, not only will this murder of five girls be removed, but it will also clear who else of this family
 - Which member of the party was involved in this disgusting plot

 Standing outside the Parliament House around noon on May 8, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced that his party's victory in Karnataka was a defeat of the bjp's ideology
 lekin yah khushi zyada der nahin rahi
 From 2 pm onwards, the Supreme Court began a three-hour hearing, which severely hit the credibility of the Prime Minister, his Law Minister, senior government lawyers and middle-class government officials

 Overall, we can say that these joint secretaries were erasing the possible sources of investigation of CBI about arbitrariness in allocation
 unhone report main yah baat bhi jodi ki 1993 or 2005 kii avadhi ke dauraan variyata or ank dene kii koi samuchit vyavastha nahin thi

 The CBI also said in the affidavit that the law minister had removed the sentence relating to the scope of the inquiry regarding the allocation being illegal while the process of amendment of the law continues
 2005 main manmohan singh ne tay kiya tha ki koyala khaanon kii nilaamee se pehle khanan kanoon main sanshodhan jaruri he
 In contrast, the Coal Ministry was of the opinion that the amendment could be through an administrative order

 “the next hearing will be held in July after the summer vacation

 madhya colombia main ek bas ke sadak se phisal kar palatney ke kaaran hui durghatana main 27 logon kii maut ho gai or 15 log ghayal ho gaye
 Officials said that the bus was going from the capital Bogota to the town of Kali and 24 people died on the spot while three died in the hospital
 rajdhani dilli main mahila ayog kii kavayad ne ek baar phir se asar dikhaaya he
 In fact, the Women's Commission has intervened in one case and mixed the husband and wife who have been living separately for 3 years
 pati ne bataaya ki patni ko usee ke mata-pita ne 3 saal se ghar main kaid karke rakhaa tha
 Acting on the complaint, the Delhi Commission for Women immediately sent its team and rescued the victim from her parents' house
 darasal, ek yuvak ne ayog main shikaayat darj karai thi ki usne 3 saal pehle 24 varshiya surekha (kaalpanik naam) se shaadi kii thi lekin ladki ke mata-pita un donon ko saath nahin rahane de rahe the
 In the complaint, the young man said that the parents of the girl did not consider their marriage to be right, whereas both of them were legally eligible to marry and they also have all the marriage papers
 25 varshiya yuvak ne bataaya ki wo donon pichley 6 saal se ek duusare se mil rahe the or teen saal pehle un donon ne shaadi kar lee thi
 But as soon as the family suspects, the girl's parents stop her leaving the house alone, and imprison her in the house
 shikaayat main yuvak ne bataaya ki wo donon ek hi mohalle ke nivasee hai, par vah apni patni surekha se mil nahin paata tha, keval phone par hi kabhi-kabhi baat kar paata tha
 Troubled by the mistreatment of the wife, the boy reached the Women's Commission and pleaded to save his wife
 ladke kii shikaayat sunakar dilli mahila ayog ection main ai or apni ek team va police ko saath lekar surekha ke mata-pita ke ghar pahunch gai
 On reaching there, the commission noticed that the girl was in a very poor condition
 ladki ne rote hue bataaya ki usko gharavaalen peetate the or kamare main band karke rakhte the
 She said that she wants to live with her husband
 ladki ke parivaar ne ayog kii team ko rokane kii koshish kii, jiske liye unhone kuch vakeelon ko bula liya or shaadi kii vaidhata par sawaal uthaae
 After much debate, the girl's family finally agreed and the girl was taken to the police station
 vahaan ladki ne apane mata-pita ke khilaaf koi bhi kanoonee karrwai karne se manaa kar diya jiske baad kuch kagaji karrwai hui or ladki ko uske pati ke saath ghar bhej diya gaya
 The team had a lot of effort in convincing the girl's parents that both are legally adults and cannot prevent them from living together
 jabaki mata-pita kii daleel thi ki unako keval ladke ke dharm se aapatti he or agar vah dharm parivartan kar legaa to unako koi pareshaani nahin
 Please tell that Surekha was resigned on 13 March
 kuch dinon ke baad ayog ne surekha se baat kii to usne bataaya ki ab vah apane pati ke khush he or uske mata pita ne usko pareshaan nahin kiya
 But still from the security point of view, the women's commission has applied to give protection to the couple in the police

 One thing is clear from the importance given to the agriculture sector and rural areas in the Union Budget that the central government is extremely upset with the bjp's performance in the Gujarat assembly elections
 in chunaavon ke nateezon se saaf he ki party kii pakad gramin ilaakon main kamjor padi he or teji se janaadhar gaiyr-bijepi partiyon ke paksh main ja rahaa he
 Therefore, in the annual budget presented on 1 February, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made big announcements for the farmers and poor keeping the rural areas at the center
 vitt mantri ne kisaanon kii aamadani ko doguna karne or garib pariwaron ko 5 lakh rupee tak kii vaarshik muft chikitsa dene kaa lakshya rakhaa
 In order to double the income of farmers, the Central Government has announced to increase the MSP of the crop by one and a half times
 to garib pariwaron tak swasth suvidha sunishchit karne ke liye duniya kii sabase badi healthcare yojana 'modicare' kii ghoshnaa kii
 With the help of these announcements, while the government is trying to prevent recurrence of Gujarat elections in Lok Sabha elections, economic experts including opposition parties claim that BJP will not succeed in its plans
 kuch raajnneetik dalon kii bhi daleel he ki in yojanaon kaa phayda kisaanon or garibon tak pahunchane main samay lagegaa or tab tak bijepi 8 rajyon or 2019 ke shuruyaat main hone vaale aam chunaavon main nuksaan uthaa chuki hogi
 Read this: The last budget of the Modi government, which was stuck around inflation, the Shiv Sena, which is in alliance with the BJP in Maharashtra, has also claimed that in 2014 the BJP showed the dream to the whole country and is in power
 lihaaja ek baar phir vah apane aakhri bajet se desh main kisaanon or garibon ko sapana dikhaa rahi he
 According to Shiv Sena, this dream of BJP once again cannot be turned into reality because the decisions of the Modi government have weakened the country's economy during the last 3-4 years
 ise padhein: doguni chhodie, in kaarnon se ek-chauthai kam ho sakati he kisaanon kii aamadanivahin kendra main vipaksh kii bhoomika main maujuuda congress ne kaha he ki modi sarkaar ne bajet ke jariye desh se khokhale vaade kiye hai kyonki maujuuda aarthik sthiti main sarkaar ke vaadon ko puraa karnaa mushkil hi nahin naammumkin he
 Former Finance Minister p Chidambaram said that in the Economic Survey that came before the budget, the government had 7 5 fisadi vikaas dar kaa sapana dikhaaya he
 But the central government has kept silence on the measures to be taken to speed up the country's economy
 isse bhi nishkarsh yah he ki kisaanon or jareeb janata ke saath kendra sarkaar ne ek baar phir jhuthe vaade kaa sahaara liya he jisase vah 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main hone vaale nuksaan ko roak sake
 According to the Union Budget, the central government has 14 on rural areas
 34 lakh karod rupee kharch kar rojgaar paidaa karne or infrastracchar ko majboot karne kaa masaudi pesh kiya he
 Apart from this, the Central Government has proposed to increase the income of farmers through MSP
 lekin zyaadaatar jaankaron kaa daawa he ki kisaanon ko emspi se sidhaa phayda kabhi nahin pahunchnaa kyonki adhikansh kisaan emspi par apana utpaada bechney main safal nahin hote
 In such a situation, it is a tough challenge for the Central Government to remove the main reason for poor performance in Gujarat elections before the Lok Sabha and other state elections

 aisa hi mere or mere priy mitra amit datta ke saath hota tha
 Coincidentally, we interviewed for the job on the same day (at Anand & Anand, the country's premier intellectual property firm) and then spent countless late nights in Draktar to learn about law and life
 amit datta jane-maane ipi vakil ban gaye lekin maine apana rasta thodaa badal liya
 This article is about the success of a new model of legal education, which Prof
 died a few weeks ago
 madhav menon ne bangaluru sthit neshnal lau skool of india uniwarsity (enelesaiu) ke jariye sthapit kiya tha
 a model that has been repeated many times — the last time i counted, the number reached 25
 kuch saal pehle main amit se milane gaya to meri mulaakaat unki beti tara se hui
 She was busy solving some English and Mathematics questions on her worksheet
 baad main amit kii patni monica, jo bharat ke pramukh antertenment lau vakeelon main se ek hai, se pataa chalaa ki tara jo kar rahi thi vah 'kumon' naamak ek japani shaikshanik takanic kaa hissaa he, jahaan chaatr purnataya doharaav or abhyaas ke madhyam se sikhte hai
 i was surprised
 pro
 Menon had inadvertently started the same thing at NLSIU, where instead of rote the law just before the exam at the end of each semester, the academic curriculum was designed to prepare students in a similar way throughout the year
 ve jaanate the ki agar kanoon ko gambhirtha se liya janaa he or ise 1980 ke dashak main sabase pratishthit rahe vyavsaayik shikshan paathyakram ejineering or chikitsa ke saath barabari par khadaa karnaa he, to yah badlaav jaruri he
 So he designed a three-month trimester model for law studies, where continuous learning was to take place
 is tremasik model ke har chaatr ko kakshaon main die jane vaali vibhinn prajentation aadi ke saath-saath do set kii pariksha or kai shodh tathaa lekhan projects karne hote the
 It was mandatory for all the students to write a research paper (called 'project') in each of their subjects
 natijatan, jab tak chaatr lau skool se uteern hokar nikalate the, tab tak ve takreeban 75 parikshaayen de chuke hote the or 60 projects likh chuke hote the
 This level of hard work and repetition meant that most students, even those who have drawn their projects by copying from various reference books, achieve something in the process
 un dinon, logon ke paas laptop yaa internet kii itani suvidha uplabdh nahin thi, isliye hamen haath se nakal kerani hoti thi or ek-ek shabd likhnaa padataa tha
 That is, during writing or copying, those words used to sit in some corner of the mind, which could be later repeated
 natijatan, adhiktar eneles chaatr buniyadi shodh or lekhan kaushal se parichit ho gaye or college se nikalate-nikalate anya lau collejon ke chaatro ke mukaable unamem behatar vidhi dakshata or lekhan kaushal viksit ho jaataa tha
 i later found out that Prof
 menon ko is kumon takanic kii koi jaankaree nahin thi
 This was actually the genius of this exemplary legal teacher
 unhone anjaane main ek aise shikshashastra kaa bidaa uthaaya tha, jisamen dakshata praapt karne ke liye unhone abhyaas, abhyaas or adhik abhyaas par jor diya
 It is the most important component for success in the legal profession
 jaruri nahin ki jane-maane vakil sabase budhimaan rahe hon balki din-raat mehnat karke or anginat mukademon ke jariye ve apana kaushal nikhaarate hai
 Soon, NLSIU became known as a brand where students are better than others, at least in legal research and writing
 kathor shaikshanik vaataavaran kaa matlab yah bhi tha ki chaatr lambey samay tak or ucch tanaav vaale vaataavaran main bhi kaam kar sakate hai
 There were many other aspects of the NLS model, including giving students greater freedom for leadership, engaging in activities such as moot courts and debates, and forming their own societies and groups
 yahaan tak ki campus kii bhartiyon bhi chaatro kii ore se sanchalit pahal thi
 Pro
 menon ne 'kanoonee sahaayta' clinics ke madhyam se kanoonee siddhant or vyavhaar ke bich pul banane kii bhi koshish kii
 In addition to bringing little clinical education to law schools, it helped to make students socially sensitive by introducing them to the power and potential of law to bring about change
 ve hameshaa kehete the: vakil ko soshal ejeeniyar hona chahie
 It was not only legal education, but education of 'justice'
 unhone ummid jataai ki eneles asaadhaaran vakeelon kii ek aisi nai nasl taiyaar karegaa, jo behatari laane ke liye samaaj ko badalenge
 At the beginning of our academic year itself, Prof
 menon ne hamen yah ehsaas dilaayaa ki ham 'chune hue' hai isliye ham khaas hai
 i feel that this psychological impetus has played an important role in writing the success story of NLS and the students here are confident with which graduates have made their brilliant debut in the professional field
 pro
 Menon promoted an understanding of the various disciplines of law, helping to shape today's lawyers who not only cite law (legal screws and lawsuits), but also the creation of new legal / policy norms
 Encourage
 kanoon kii saamagree aksar anya vishyon se lee jaati he
 Thus, the interdisciplinary approach was extremely important to understand the true essence of legal norms and its larger socio-cultural and economic impact
 lekin sabase badhkar, pro
 Menon had a clear vision for legal education and was able to attract committed faculty for his purpose

 Padmanabh Pillai was the one who taught us corporate law
 un dinon, bharat udaarikaran kii prakriya main tha or sebi jaise santhaan or epadi jaise shabd aksar surkhiyon main rahete the
 However, Prof
 pillai ne in naveenatam bahason main padane se manaa kar diya or hamen korporate kanoon kii mul baaten sikhain, jinamein kai maamle to 1900 kii shuruyaat ke the
 We were disappointed and flare up because of studying cases where the parties concerned (such as Salomon) had died long ago but Pro
 pillai un maamalon par hi date rahe
 He made references to the latest cases, but his emphasis was more on basic jurisprudential fundamentals
 unka tark tha ki agar neenv majboot nahin hogi to aap iske upar kabhi majboot imaarat khadi nahin kar sakenge
 This is an approach advocated by big entrepreneurs like Elon Musk
 jab unase poocha gaya ki ve gyaan ke itane alag-alag kshetron main kaise kaamyaab rahe, to unhone kaha, ''gyaan ko ek shabdaarth bataane vaale vriksh ke rup main dekhnaa chahie
 Make sure that you have understood the basic principle, that is, the trunk and large branches of the tree before going into the leaves / descriptions
 anyathaa un shakhaon par kuch bhi latakta nahin milegaa
 In NLS, there was a clear focus on fundamental 'first principles'
 ham bhaagyashaalee rahe ki hamen kam se kam aise kuch shikshakon (jaise pro
 Pillai), who adopted this principle in the study of law and focused on building the trunk and roots of our legal tree, the leaves of which we had to grow on our own
 or yah majboot neenv thi (vishesh rup se korporate kanoon main) jiske kaaran eneles ke sïnaatak vidhi fermon main sabase aage rahete hai
 The tragedy today is that we wander more to 'peripherals' at the expense of basic infrastructure
 chaatr sibar kanoon par course ke liye zyada umadte hai
 They do not feel that this is nothing more than traditional legal remedies for cyberspace (such as defamation law and contract law)
 1930 ke donoghew banaam stivension maamle kii samaj ke bina drone sambandhit kshati ke liye deyta nirdhaarit karne vaale aadhunik utpeeda kanoonon ko puri tarah samajha hi nahin ja saktaa
 It is not that the NLS model is perfect
 isse itar chijen bhi rahi hai
 Pro
 menon ne ummid kii thi ki unke chaatr bharat ke vanchiton or haashie ke samudaayon kaa paksh rakhenge lekin isse ulat yahaan ke bahutayat chaatr bharat ke korporate vanijyik kshetra main gaye
 Furthermore, faculty members were so heavily burdened with teaching that they could not be encouraged to publish new perspectives on legal paradigms and develop new concepts
 lekin ek baat jo ham sabhi pro
 One can learn from Menon, that is his ability to adapt to the situation
 apni puraani baat ko chhodkar ve lagaataar nae vichaaron kii talash main jute rahete the or use apnaane ke liye hameshaa taiyaar rahete the
 His mastery in anticipating the big trends ahead was supernatural, as he did with the use of continuing professional education for lawyers
 yah ek aisa pahalu tha jise hamane lambey samay tak upekshit rakhaa tha
 Pro
 menon ab hamaare bich nahin hai, lekin unka jajba hameshaa maujuud rahegaa
 Learning was a lifelong process for him
 unka maananaa tha ki khud ko nikhaarane ke liye satat adhyayan karte rahanaa vyakti ke liye jaruri he
 In fact, last year (just a few days after his 83rd birthday), i noticed that during a workshop he was sitting in all the presentations and carefully taking notes! He was always dedicated to making others skillful
 aaie, ham yah ummid rakhen ki hamaare bhavishya ke shikshak unki viraasat ke saath nyaay karenge
 And they will continue the tradition of continuously improving the pedagogy, giving the country brilliant lawyers, problem solvers and game changers

 yah ascharyajanak kadam unhone fasebuk kaa ab tak kaa sabase bada ipo bazaar main aane or uske sheyaron kii kharid nasdek main shuru hone ke baad uthaaya he
 Zuckerberg has written about this big event in his life in the Facebook timeline

 'the ceremony took place in the backyard of Palo Alto Residence in Zuckerberg, California, attended by less than 100 guests
 jukerbarg kii muskuraati hui tasviir lagaai gai he or unhen saadhaaran gahare nile rang kaa suut, safed kameez or ek taai pahan rakhi he

 ’ Extremist and religious organizations have been defeated in Pakistan's general elections
 mumbai hamalon ke mukhya aaropee hafiz said kii allaah o akbar taharik ko ek bhi seat nahin mili he
 Hafiz Saeed himself also campaigned
 uski party ko pakistan chunaav ayog ne manyata nahin di thi
 Reports coming from there have been reported that a large number of such candidates have lost in the provincial and national assemblies
 nateezon kaa elaan nahin hua he magar inaki haar pakki bataai ja rahi he
 Except a few candidates, no one is likely to win
 chunaav se pehle kattarpanthi takaton ke ubharne kii ashanka jataai ja rahi thi magar kai charnon kii ginati ke baad aisa lag rahaa he ki janata ne aise tatwon ko thukraa diya he
 But losing the election has reduced the radical forces
 There is no hurry to reach this conclusion
 unki harakatein chunavi raajnneeti par nirbhar nahin hai
 On the other hand, Imran Khan's party is moving towards victory
 pakistan taharike insaaf sabase badi party banakar ubhari he
 Nawaz Sharif's party Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz has not accepted the results
 aam taur par yahi rivaaj tha ki mahilaayein vot nahin karengi
 Candidates, political parties and household men also stopped and did not encourage women to vote
 2015 ke dir upachunaav main ek bhi mahila voter ne vot nahin daalaa tha, is kaaran pakistan chunaav ayog ne us upachunaav ko bhi khaarij kar diya
 Two years later, under the Elections Act of 2017, it became law that if less than ten percent of the women vote in an area, their election will be considered void
 bas is ek niyam se ummidavaar or raajnneetik kaaryakarta ghar-ghar se mahilaon ko nikaal kar matdaan centre tak laane lage
 It is true that the voter turnout of women voters is low but to save the election, removing them from home says a lot
 kaibar pakhtoonkhwaa, baluchistan or punjab main bhi mahila matadaataaon ne vot daale hai
 a large number of women have cast their votes
 yah bhi sahi he ki sabhi panjikrut mahila votaron ne vot nahin daale yaa 10 pratishat se kuch adhik matadaataaon ne hi vot daale magar unka baahar nikalnaa pakistan ke chunaav ko yaadgaar bana gaya
 Female voters had ceased to exist since the 1990s
 pakistan ke nae ellection act ke anusaar har raajnneetik dal ko kam se kam paanch pratishat mahila ummidavaar ko khadaa karnaa anivaary he
 There were 171 women candidates for the National Assembly in Pakistan
 kitni mahilaayein jiti hai, iskaa sahi andaaza sabhi nattejey aane ke baad hi lag sakegaa
 This time the first Dalit woman has been elected in Pakistan's Senate, named Krishna Kumar Kohli
 bharat main sansad main mahilaon ke aarakshan kii baat dashakon se chal hi rahi he magar hamen bhi nahin pataa tha ki 2017 main pakistan main aisa niyam ban gaya, jiske tahat paanch pratishat mahila ummidavaaron ko utaarna anivaary kar diya gaya
 Was reading the newspapers there
 bharat main jab panchayat chunaavon main mahilaon ko aarakshan mila tha tab shuru main badi sankhya main unke hi pati kaa cheharaa poster par hota tha, vaise to ab bhi hota he magar thik isi tarah par kai mahila ummidavaaron ne poster par apana cheharaa tak nahin lagaaya
 There used to be a picture of her husband
 ab aate hai imran khan par
 On the new Prime Minister of Pakistan
 imran ne aaj pakistan ko sambodhit karte hue kai baaten kahin
 Imran's words will be analyzed in the coming time, but the things he said on the first day are important
 to pakistan ke pradhanmantri ke rup main imran khan shahi mahal main nahin rahenge
 Will live in a small place
 mantri se lekar saansad bhi saamaanya gharon main rahete hue janata kii seva karenge
 The emphasis of Imran's speech is that he will reduce the government's expenses which are made in the name of protocol
 jo shahi shaan shaukat ke liye kiye jate hai
 Before clapping, also think for a minute that such things are said to come to power today
 duniya bhar main kuch nayaa karne ke liye kah to diya jaataa he, kar bhi diya jaataa he magar aam janata kii zindagi par kya vaaki pehle se zyaada asar padataa he, aisa bahut kam dekhne ko mila he
 Still, it should be seen what is the residence of the Prime Minister of Pakistan, which Imran Khan will convert into a hotel
 vaaki hotel jaisaa he
 There is also an office here
 nivas bhi he
 Since 1973, the Prime Minister of Pakistan has lived in this royal palace
 ab yahaan nae pradhanmantri ke rup main imran khan nahin rahenge
 This time the budget for maintenance of Prime Minister's residence 16
 17 pratishat badha diya gaya tha
 Its budget has been kept at around 100 crores in Pakistani rupees
 ise lekar kai sawaal bhi uthe the
 This building is in Islamabad
 kya vaaki yah shahi mahal he
 All these things sound good
 aaj kal rivaaj ho gaya he, janata yakeen bhi kar leti he magar kul milakar bahut thos riselt nahin aata he
 This does not mean that the leader should not live with simplicity but he has some needs
 aap kahin bhi rahen, janata ko yah dekhnaa chahie ki aapaki nitiyon kii vajah se uskaa jivan badal rahaa he yaa nahin
 Will Imran Khan be able to give employment to the youth, his words did not show any special and new formula, it is definitely good to hear, because such things always sound good
 imran khan ko sena kii kathputli kaha ja rahaa he
 They are also talking about investigation on giving concrete evidence
 imran ne apane sambodhan main garibi dur karne or gavarnence par jor diya he
 He talks of improving the human index
 acha he ki koi netaa in sab baton ko rekhaankit kare or or bhi acha ho jab wo vaaki kuch karke dikhaae
 According to the UN report, 39 percent of Pakistan's population lives in poverty
 sabase zyada garibi phata or baluchistan main he
 At the beginning of his talk, Imran thanked the people of Balochistan that even after the terrorist attack, the people came out to vote
 pakistan ko nivesh priy mulk ke rup main bhi kaayam karnaa chaahate hai
 The formula for making an investment-friendly country is the same with everyone
 gaur se dekhenge to kisi ke paas nayaa idia nahin he
 Everyone has the same opinion that if investment comes, employment will come, Pakistanis living abroad will invest in their country and Indians will invest in their country
 behatar he ki bharat main bhi dekh liya jaae ki jitna videshi nivesh hota he usamen kitna pratishat baahar rahane vaale bharatiyon kaa hota he or yahi hisaab pakistan bhi apane yahaan kar le
 The purpose is to tell whether the investment comes on this basis or whether the investing players are something else, for which the field is opened in the name of NRI
 pakistan kaa 2017-18 kaa aarthik survey ke anusaar 2015-16 main 24
 3 percent people are below the poverty line
 2005-06 main 50
 4 percent are below the poverty line
 das saal main pakistan ne 50 pratishat garibi kam kii he
 Earlier, six crore people were poor, now five crore people are said
 iske baad bhi imran garibi dur karne ke maamle main china kii misaal de rahe the
 Imran Khan did not say a word about terrorism
 aatankwaad se pakistan kaise nipatega, iskaa zikr tak nahin kiya
 Radical forces may have lost the election, but they did not say how to control them
 imran ke pakistan main sena kii kya bhoomika hogi yaa sena ke pakistan main imran kii kya bhoomika hogi, is par bhi na to saaf saaf kaha na ishaaron main kaha
 Imran Khan also drew the blueprint of his government's foreign policy
 unki baton main bharat aakhri number par aayaa
 First came China, then Afghanistan, then America, then Iran, then Middle East then India
 satta main saadagi aae or kahin bhi aae isse acchhee baat kya ho sakati he, lekin kya vaaki imran us pakistan ko badal paaenge jisane chunaav prachaar ke dauraan hi kai bam dhamaake dekhe or kai logon kii jane gayi
 Talking about India said that it is better for this subcontinent that India and Pakistan remain friends
 ek mez par baithkar kashmir par baat karen
 If the leadership of India is ready, we will move one step forward, we will move two steps
 yaheen ek line fouj ko lekar kahi he ki fouj se masale nahin hote hai
 So are they saying the same thing to their army
 imran kii baton se yah saaf nahin hua he
 Imran Khan has come to power by promising to give employment to 1 crore people and 50 lakh cheaper houses
 is saal may main United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Pakistan kii report se bhi pakistan ke bare main kuch or andaaza hota he
 64 percent of the population is under 30 years of age
 29 pratishat aabaadi 15 se 29 saal kii he
 The youngest country in the world
 is report main kaha gaya he ki skulon main jis raftaar se admician ho rahaa he us hisaab se sabhi bacchon ko shikshit karne main pakistan ko 60 saal lag jaaenge
 According to the Economic Survey of Pakistan the literacy rate there has come down from 60 percent to 58 percent
 kyonki shiksha ke liye paryaapt paise nahin hai uske paas
 Pakistan is one of the 15 countries in the world that spends the least on education
 pakistan kaa urja or parivahan sector china ke hawaale hai
 China has a lot of investment in this sector
 pakistan kii jidipi 5
 7 percent is near, there is talk of taking it to seven percent in the media there, but the World Bank has said that 5 in 2019
 9 pratishat se bhi kam hokar 5 pratishat ho jayega
 The comments The Dawn akhbaar main pakistan ke purv rajdoot munir akram kaa lekh pard rahaa tha
 It got mentioned about farming
 imran khan ne bhi garib kisaanon kii baat kii he magar ek do pankti main hi pakistan kii jidipi main kheti kaa hissaa 25 pratishat he
 40 percent of Pakistan's labor force is in farming
 duniya kaa sabase bada sinchai system hone kaa daawa he
 Even then, production is the lowest in the world compared to cost
 isliye pakistan kii kheti main kaaphi sudhaar kii zarurat he
 We have come to see and know Pakistan in the same frame continuously, but to see a country is not enough to understand
 2014 kii da don akhbaar kii ek khabar dekh rahaa tha usamen zikr he ki pakistan main medical college se embibies paas kar nikalne vaali 50 fisadi ladkiyaan kabhi practice hi nahin karti hai
 Every year 14,000 doctors are made in Pakistan, of which 70 percent are women
 ab sochie isamen se aadhi mahilaayein practice hi na karen to kya haal hota hoga vahaan
 Pakistan has the highest number of newborn deaths in the world
 duusare number par afghanistan he
 According to Pakistan's National Nutrition Survey, 45 percent of children are weak due to lack of nutritious food
 unki lambaai bad nahin paati he
 Look at Pakistan from this point of view, India will feel about many problems
 media freedom kii ranking ke maamle main bharat or pakistan sachche padosi kii tarah agal bagal hai
 India is at number 138 and Pakistan at number 139
 duusari taraf imran khan kii party jeet kii taraf bad rahi he
 Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf has emerged as the largest party
 nawaz sharif kii party pakistan muslim lig nawaz ne nateezon ko sweekaar nahin kiya he
 Generally, the custom was that women would not vote
 ummidavaar, raajnneetik dal or ghar ke mard rokte bhi the or protsaahit bhi nahin karte the ki mahilaayein matdaan karen
 Not a single woman voter had cast a vote in the 2015 Dir by-election, due to which the Pakistan Election Commission rejected that by-election
 uske do saal baad 2017 ke ellection act ke tahat kanoon ban gaya ki agar kisi kshetra main das fisadi se kam mahilaayein vot karengi to uskaa chunaav radd mana jayega
 By this one rule, candidates and political activists removed women from house to house and brought them to the polling station
 sahi he ki mahila voter kaa matdaan pratishat kam rahaa magar chunaav bachaane ke liye unhen ghar se nikaalnaa bahut kuch kahata he
 Women voters have also cast votes in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and Punjab
 badi sankhya main mahilaon ne vot daale hai
 It is also true that not all registered women voters cast their votes or more than 10 percent of the voters cast their votes, but their exit made the election of Pakistan memorable
 1990 ke dashak ke baad se mahila votaron kaa nikalnaa band ho gaya tha
 According to Pakistan's new election act, it is mandatory for every political party to field at least five percent of the female candidates
 pakistan main neshnal assembly ke liye 171 mahila ummidavaar maidan main thim
 How many women have won, it can only be judged after all the results
 pakistan ke seenet main is baar pehali dalit mahila chuni gai hai, jinka naam krishna kumaar kohli he
 Talk of reservation of women in Parliament in India has been going on for decades but we did not even know that in 2017, a rule was made in Pakistan, under which it was made mandatory to field five percent women candidates
 vahaan ke akhabaaron ko pard rahaa tha
 When women got reservation in panchayat elections in India, initially a large number of her own husband's face was on the poster, although it still happens but in the same way many women candidates did not even put their face on the poster
 unke pati kii tasviir lagi hoti thi
 Now come to Imran Khan
 pakistan ke hone vaale nae pradhanmantri par
 Imran said many things while addressing Pakistan today
 imran kii baton kaa aane vaale samay main vishleshan hoga, lekin pehle din jo baaten kahi hai wo mahatvapurn he
 So Imran Khan as the Prime Minister of Pakistan will not stay in the royal palace
 choti si jagah par rahenge
 Ministers to mps will also serve the public while staying in common houses
 imran ke bhaashan kaa sara jor is baat par he ki ve sarkaar ke un kharchon ko kam karenge jo protocol ke naam par kiye jate hai
 Which are done for royal pride Shaukat
 tali bajaane se pehle ek minute ke liye yah bhi soch len ki aaj kal satta main aane ke liye aisi baaten kahi jaati hai
 The world over is asked to do something new, it is also taxed, but what really affects the lives of the common people more than ever before, is very rare
 phir bhi dekhnaa chahie ki pakistan ke pradhanmantri kaa nivas kaisaa he jise imran khan hotel main badal denge
 Really like a hotel
 yaheen daftar bhi he
 There is also a residence
 1973 se pakistan ke pradhanmantri is shahi mahal main rahete aae hai
 Now Imran Khan will no longer be the new Prime Minister
 is baar pradhanmantri nivas ke rakrakhaav kaa bajet 16
 Was increased by 17 percent
 pakistani rupee main iskaa bajet kareeb 100 karod rakhaa gaya he
 Many questions were also raised about this
 yah imaarat islamabad main he
 Is this really a royal palace
 yah sab baaten acchhee lagati hai sunne main
 Nowadays, it is customary, the public also believes, but overall there is not a very concrete result
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki netaa ko saadagi se nahin rahanaa chahie magar uski kuch zaruuratein hoti hai wo to hona hi chahie
 Wherever you are, the public should see whether his life is changing because of your policies
 kya imran khan naujavaanon ko rojgaar de paaenge, unki baton se koi khaas or nayaa formula to nahin dikhaa, zarur sunne main acha laga, kyonki aisi baaten hameshaa sunne main acchhee lagati he
 Imran Khan is being called the puppet of the army
 ve thos pramaan dene par jaanch kii baat bhi kar rahe hai
 In his address, Imran has emphasized poverty and governance
 ve maanav suchakank main sudhaar kii baat karte hai
 It is good that a leader underlines all these things and it is even better when he really does something
 sanyukt raashtra kii report ke anusaar pakistan kii aabaadi kaa 39 fisadi hissaa garibi main jeeta he
 Pata and Balochistan have the highest poverty
 imran ne apni baat kii shuruyaat main baluchistan ke logon kaa shukriya adaa kiya ki aatankwaadi hamale ke baad bhi vahaan ke log vot dene ke liye nikle
 We also want to establish Pakistan as an investment friendly country
 nivesh priy mulk banane kaa formula bhi vahi he jo sabake paas he
 If we look closely, no one has a new idea
 sabake paas vahi bate hai ki nivesh aayega to rojgaar aayega, videshon main rahane vaale pakistani apane desh main or bhartiya apane desh main nivesh karenge
 It is better to see in India also how much foreign investment is made by Indians living outside it and Pakistan should also do the same
 yah bataane kaa makasad yah he ki kya nivesh is aadhaar par aata he yaa phir nivesh karne vaale khilaadi kuch or hote hai, jinke liye maidan enarai ke naam par kholaa jaataa he
 24 in 2015-16 as per Economic Survey of Pakistan 2017-18
 3 pratishat log garibi rekha ke neeche hai
 50 in 2005–06
 4 pratishat log garibi rekha ke neeche hai
 In ten years, Pakistan has reduced poverty by 50 percent
 pehle chah karod log garib the, ab paanch karod bataae jate hai
 Even after this, Imran was giving the example of China in the matter of removing poverty
 imran khan ne aatankwaad ko lekar ek shabd nahin kaha
 Did not even mention how Pakistan will deal with terrorism
 kattarpanthi takatein bhale chunaav main haari hai magar un par kaise lagaam lagayegaa kuch nahin kaha
 Neither the role of the army in Imran's Pakistan or the role of Imran in the army of Pakistan, neither stated clearly or said in gestures
 imran khan ne apni sarkaar kii videsh niti kaa khaakaa bhi khinchaa
 In his talks, India came in last
 pehle china aayaa, phir afghanistan, phir america aayaa, phir iran, phir madhya purv tab jaakar bharat
 What can be a better thing than simplicity in power and anywhere, but can Imran really change the Pakistan that has witnessed many bomb blasts during election campaign and many people have lost their lives
 bharat ke bare main baat karte hue kaha ki is upmahadweep ke liye behatar he ki bharat or pakistan dost bane rahen
 Sit on a table and talk on Kashmir
 agar hindustan kii leadership taiyaar he, ek kadam aage badhegi to ham do kadam badhenge
 Here a line has been said about the army that there are no issues with the army
 to kya ve apni sena ko bhi yahi baat kah rahe hai
 It is not clear from Imran's words
 imran khan 1 karod logon ko rojgaar dene kaa or 50 lakh sasta ghar dene kaa vaada kar satta main aae hai
 The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Pakistan report in May this year also gives some more idea about Pakistan
 aabaadi kaa 64 pratishat 30 saal se kam kaa he
 29 percent of the population is between 15 and 29 years old
 duniya kaa sabase jawan mulk he
 This report says that Pakistan will take 60 years to educate all children according to the speed at which admission is being done in schools
 pakistan ke aarthik survey ke hisaab se waha sakshartaa dar 60 pratishat se ghatakar 58 pratishat ho gai he
 Because he does not have enough money for education
 pakistan duniya ke un 15 deshon main se ek he jo shiksha par sabase kam karch karata he
 Pakistan's energy and transport sector is referred to China
 china kaa is sector main bahut nivesh he
 GDP of Pakistan 5
 7 pratishat ke paas he, vahaan ke media main ise saat pratishat tak le jane kii baat hoti rahati he magar vishwa bank ne kaha he ki 2019 main 5
 Will be reduced from 9 percent to 5 percent
 tippaniyan The Dawn newspaper was reading an article by Munir Akram, former Pakistan Ambassador
 isamen kheti ke bare main zikr mila
 Imran Khan has also talked about poor farmers, but in a row, agriculture's share of Pakistan's GDP is 25 percent
 pakistan kii shram shakti kaa 40 pratishat kheti main he
 It claims to have the world's largest irrigation system
 iske baad bhi laagat kii tulana main utpaadan duniya main sabase kam he
 Therefore, there is a need for considerable improvement in the farming of Pakistan
 ham pakistan ko lagaataar ek hi frem main dekhte or jaanate aae hai, magar ek mulk ko dekhne samajhane ke liye kaaphi nahin he
 In 2014, The Dawn was watching a newspaper report that 50 percent of girls who passed MBBS from a medical college in Pakistan never practice
 pakistan main har saal 14,000 doctor banate hai, jinamein se 70 fisadi mahilaayein hoti hai
 Now think if half of these women do not practice then what will happen there? duniya main sabase adhik navjaat shishu kii maut pakistan main hoti he
 Afghanistan is at number two
 pakistan ke neshnal neutrishan survey ke mutabik 45 pratishat bachche paushtik aahaar na milane ke kaaran kamazor hai
 Their length does not increase
 is nazar se bhi pakistan ko dekhie kai samasyaon ke bare main bharat jaisaa lagegaa
 In terms of ranking of media freedom, India and Pakistan are side by side as true neighbors
 bharat 138wein number par he or pakistan 139 wein number par
 Women voters have also cast votes in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and Punjab
 badi sankhya main mahilaon ne vot daale hai
 It is also true that not all registered women voters cast their votes or more than 10 percent of the voters cast their votes, but their exit made the election of Pakistan memorable
