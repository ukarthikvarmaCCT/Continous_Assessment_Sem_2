 duniya kii aadhi ozon parat barbaad ho jaaegi
 Half of the world will end its winter-summer season
 duniya ko parmaanu sardi tabah kar degi

 That is, half of the world will stop the process of winter-summer season
 aise main bahut mumkin he ki is jang ke baad aisi bhayanak sardi pade ki duniya se vegetesan yani ped-paudhon kaa naamo-nishaan hi mit jaae

 argedy ne bhagalpur se shailesh kumaar urf boolo mandal or baankaa se jaiprakash yadav ko maidan main utaara he
 However, the announcement of candidates for Katihar, Purnia and Kishanganj seats in the Congress account has been stopped
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki mahagathbandhan main seat bantwaare ko lekar congress alaakaman khush nahin hai
 The information given to Congress President Rahul Gandhi, who came to rally in Purnia on Saturday, was not good
 yahi kaaran he ki unhone congress ke bihar prabharee shakti singh gohil or pradesh adhyaksh madan mohan jha samet kai netaaon ko dilli talab kiya he
 At the Mahagathbandhan press conference, the current Congress state spokesperson Harkhu Jha said that he was informed from Delhi that the Congress would announce its candidates after the meeting in Delhi was over
 unhone kaha ki dilli se pradesh adhyaksh madan mohan jha ne unhen phone kar aisa karne ko kaha he
 While the list of candidates was being considered absolutely fixed

 But at the last moment the Congress did not announce its candidates
 mana ja rahaa he ki seat bantwaare ko lekar congress or argedy main deal puri tarah se nahin ho pai he
 Tejashwi Yadav was absent even on the day of seat-sharing announcement, while the video of Congress state president Madan Mohan Jha and rjd's Manoj Jha went viral, it is enough to tell a lot
 gauratlab he ki chunavi raily ke liye purniya aae congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko seat bantwaare se judi jaankaree dene ke baad rahul gandhi ke saath bihar congress ke 3 bade netaa shakti singh gohil, madan mohan jha or akhilesh singh dilli ravaanaa ho gaye hai
 The news is that Rahul Gandhi is unhappy about the seat sharing
 aise main rahul gandhi ne in teen netaaon ko dilli talab kar liya he
 The news is also that the Congress may soon take a big decision regarding seat sharing
 shanivaar ko purniya main hui rahul gandhi kii sabha se bhi argedy ne duuri bana lee thi
 Tejashwi Yadav was also absent from the mahagathbandhan's first election show
 in sabhi ghatnakramon se saaf he ki bihar main mahagathbandhan ke saath sabakuch thik nahin chal rahaa
 If all goes well, the Congress would have announced its candidates like RJD, but it is not so, indicating some unhappiness in seat sharing

 These days the cross examination of the trial given by David Headley, a witness to the 26 / 11 attacks in Mumbai's special court, continues
 yah kaarywahi buudhvaar se shuru hui he
 This proceeding continues on Thursday
 aaj bachaav paksh ke ek sawaal ke jawaab ne hedli ne bataaya ki shivasena pramukh bal thakare ko maarane kii ek baar koshish hui thi
 However he also said that he does not know much
 hedli ne bhi ye bataaya ki use pataa chalaa tha ki wo shaks pakadaa bhi gaya tha, lekin baad main wo police hiraasat se bhaag bhi gaya tha
 Headley also told that Sajid Mir of LET had asked him to go to Shiv Sena Bhavan and make friendship
 LET shivasena pramukh bal thakare ko maarna chahta tha
 Headley said that after watching the 26 / 11 terror attack on TV, Headley's wife Sajia congratulated Headley and said that he saw the cartoon
 sajia ne hamalon ke liye hedli ko badhai bhi di thi
 In response to defense questions in the court, Headley obeyed the above and clarified that he used the word cartoon for my protection
 hedli ne ye baat bhi maani ki usne hi sajia ko kuta bhashaa main hi mail karne ko kaha tha
 But what is the name of Sajia's father and whether he was associated with ISI
 hedli ne nijee maamla bataakar jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 Jundal's lawyer Abdul Wahab Khan also asked questions related to Headley's first wife Fayza in the cross examination
 masalan kya faiza ne pakistan main america duutavas main shikaayat kii thi ki wo aatanki sanghathan se judaa he
 In response, Headley said yes and said that he had complained about being associated with LET
 hedli ne ye bhi mana ki faiza ke saath jab wo mumbai aayaa tha tab usne taj hotel kaa video banaaya tha
 When Jundal's lawyer asks if Fiza did not interrupt him
 hedli kaa jawaab tha ki use makasad hi pataa nahin tha to aapatti kyon karti ? Asked if Fiza had met the LET chiefs and asked you to leave
 is par jaj ne wahaab se apana sawaal sahi tareeke se rakhane ko kaha
 Then Wahab said in Hindi that any wife can take such a step to save her Suhag
 is par hedli ne bhi hindi main hi mazaakia lahaze main kaha, suhaag ko bachaana to filmi doylog he
 Whom was i in danger that she would request to save
 darasal faiza ko lagata tha ki main LET ke logon ko maanata hum isliye agar wo kahenge to main maan jaaoongaa
 So he requested to meet them
 jundaal ke ye sawaal poochne par ki LET se shikaayat karne kii vajah se aapane use talaak de diya
 Headley denied this, saying that he had already been divorced
 bataa den ki buudhvaar ko hedli ne aatanki sanghathan laskar-e-tayba ko rupye dene kaa daawa kar sabkon chaunkaa diya tha
 The opportunity was to testify against the 26 / 11 accused Abu Jundal
 adaalat main jab jundaal ke vakil ne jab baar-baar ye sawaal kiya ki aatanki sanghathan laskar-e-tayba se kitne rupee mili the
 So, Headley said that he did not get the money, but he himself donated 60 to 70 lakh rupees to Lashkar
 tippaniyan Jundal's lawyer presented before Headley the court's earlier arrests, his policy of becoming a government witness, and the subsequent breaking of rules
 kul milakar bachaav paksh ne apane sawaalon ke zariye hedli ke aapraadhik itihaas or uske dohare charitra ko saamne laane ko koshish kii, taaki yah sabit ho sake ki hedli ke khulaason par aankh mundakar bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam appeared to give a clarification on this
 nikam ke mutabik hedli apradhi tha tabhi to 26 / 11 ke aatanki hamale main madad kii
 The prosecution and the defense in the court also had a significant knock
 yah maamla tab or garm ho gaya jab hedli ne apni patni se jude kisi bhi sawaal kaa jawaab dene se saafe inkaar kar diya tha
 Although Headley is a witness to the apology, but his callous attitude is saying something else
 adaalat ne bhi is baat ko notice kiya or hedli ko tokaa bhi
 Headley also stated that he had come to know that the man had also been caught, but later he had also escaped from police custody
 hedli ne ye bhi bataaya ki LET ke sajid mir ne use shivasena bhawan main jaakar dosti banane ko kaha tha
 LET wanted to kill Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray
 hedli ne bataaya ki 26 / 11 aatanki hamale ko tivi par dekh hedli kii patni sajia ne hedli ko badhai dete hue kaha tha ki usne cartoon dekha
 Sajia also congratulated Headley for the attacks
 adaalat main bachaav paksh ke sawaalon ke jawaab main hedli ne uparokt baat maani or safai di ki meri suraksha ke liye usne cartoon shabd kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Headley also agreed that it was he who had asked Sajia to match it in code
 lekin kya he sajia ke pita kaa naam or kya wo ISI se jude the
 Headley refused to respond, citing a personal matter
 jundaal ke vakil abdul wahaab khan ne cross ejamination main hedli kii pehali patni faiza se jude sawaal bhi puche
 For example, did Fiza complain at the American embassy in Pakistan that he was associated with a terrorist organization
 jawaab main hedli ne haa kaha or bataaya ki usne LET se jude hone kii shikaayat kii thi
 Headley also admitted that he had made a video of the Taj Hotel when he came to Mumbai with Fiza
 jundaal ke vakil ke ye poochne par ki kya faiza ne use tokaa nahin
 Headley's answer was that he did not know the motive, so why object? ye poochne par ki kya faiza ne LET ke pramukhon se milakar aapako chhodane kii baat kahi thi
 On this, the judge asked Wahab to put his question correctly
 tab wahaab ne hindi main kaha ki koi bhi patni apane suhaag ko bachaane ke liye is tarah kaa kadam uthaa sakati he
 On this, Headley also said in a funny tone in Hindi itself, to save Suhag is a film dialogue
 mujhe kisase khatra tha jo wo bachaane kii guhaar lagaati
 Actually Fiza felt that i believed the people of LET, so if they say i will agree
 isliye usne unase milakar guhaar lagaai thi
 On asking Jundal the question that you divorced him because of complaining to LET
 hedli ne ye kah kar inkaar kiya ki uskaa talaak pehle hi ho chukaa tha
 Let us know that on Wednesday, Headley surprised everyone by claiming to have given money to the terrorist organization laskar-e-taiba
 mauka tha 26 / 11 ke hi aaropee abu jundaal ke khilaaf chal rahe mukademe main gavaahi kaa
 In the court, when Jundal's lawyer repeatedly asked how much money was received from the terrorist organization laskar-e-taiba
 to vifarte hue hedli ne kaha ki use rupee mili nahin he balki usne khud lashkar ko 60 se 70 lakh rupee daan die the
 The comments jundaal ke vaqeel ne hedli kii pehle kii giraftaaryaan, uski sarkari gavaah banane kii niti or baad main niyamon ko todane kii baat court ke saamne pesh kii
 Overall, the defense tried to bring to light Headley's criminal history and his double character through his questions to prove that Headley's revelations could not be blindly trusted
 vishesh sarkari vakil ujjwal nikam is par safaai dete hue nazar aaye
 According to Nikam, Headley was the culprit when he helped in the 26 / 11 terror attack
 adaalat main abhiyojan paksh or bachaav paksh main khaasi nonk jhonk bhi hui
 The matter became even more heated when Headley refused to answer any questions about his wife
 yun to hedli maafi kaa gavaah he lekin uskaa talkh ravaiya kuch or hi kah rahaa he
 The court also notices this and hides Headley
 hedli ne bataaya ki 26 / 11 aatanki hamale ko tivi par dekh hedli kii patni sajia ne hedli ko badhai dete hue kaha tha ki usne cartoon dekha
 Sajia also congratulated Headley for the attacks
 adaalat main bachaav paksh ke sawaalon ke jawaab main hedli ne uparokt baat maani or safai di ki meri suraksha ke liye usne cartoon shabd kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Headley also agreed that it was he who had asked Sajia to match it in code
 lekin kya he sajia ke pita kaa naam or kya wo ISI se jude the
 Headley refused to respond, citing a personal matter
 jundaal ke vakil abdul wahaab khan ne cross ejamination main hedli kii pehali patni faiza se jude sawaal bhi puche
 For example, did Fiza complain at the American embassy in Pakistan that he was associated with a terrorist organization
 jawaab main hedli ne haa kaha or bataaya ki usne LET se jude hone kii shikaayat kii thi
 Headley also admitted that he had made a video of the Taj Hotel when he came to Mumbai with Fiza
 jundaal ke vakil ke ye poochne par ki kya faiza ne use tokaa nahin

 yun to hedli maafi kaa gavaah he lekin uskaa talkh ravaiya kuch or hi kah rahaa he
 The court also notices this and hides Headley
 hedli ne ye baat bhi maani ki usne hi sajia ko kuta bhashaa main hi mail karne ko kaha tha
 But what is the name of Sajia's father and whether he was associated with ISI
 hedli ne nijee maamla bataakar jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 Jundal's lawyer Abdul Wahab Khan also asked questions related to Headley's first wife Fayza in the cross examination
 masalan kya faiza ne pakistan main america duutavas main shikaayat kii thi ki wo aatanki sanghathan se judaa he
 In response, Headley said yes and said that he had complained about being associated with LET
 hedli ne ye bhi mana ki faiza ke saath jab wo mumbai aayaa tha tab usne taj hotel kaa video banaaya tha
 When Jundal's lawyer asks if Fiza did not interrupt him
 hedli kaa jawaab tha ki use makasad hi pataa nahin tha to aapatti kyon karti ? Asked if Fiza had met the LET chiefs and asked you to leave
 is par jaj ne wahaab se apana sawaal sahi tareeke se rakhane ko kaha
 Then Wahab said in Hindi that any wife can take such a step to save her Suhag
 is par hedli ne bhi hindi main hi mazaakia lahaze main kaha, suhaag ko bachaana to filmi doylog he
 Whom was i in danger that she would request to save
 darasal faiza ko lagata tha ki main LET ke logon ko maanata hum isliye agar wo kahenge to main maan jaaoongaa
 So he requested to meet them
 jundaal ke ye sawaal poochne par ki LET se shikaayat karne kii vajah se aapane use talaak de diya
 Headley denied this, saying that he had already been divorced
 bataa den ki buudhvaar ko hedli ne aatanki sanghathan laskar-e-tayba ko rupye dene kaa daawa kar sabkon chaunkaa diya tha
 The opportunity was to testify against the 26 / 11 accused Abu Jundal
 adaalat main jab jundaal ke vakil ne jab baar-baar ye sawaal kiya ki aatanki sanghathan laskar-e-tayba se kitne rupee mili the
 So, Headley said that he did not get the money, but he himself donated 60 to 70 lakh rupees to Lashkar
 tippaniyan Jundal's lawyer presented before Headley the court's earlier arrests, his policy of becoming a government witness, and the subsequent breaking of rules
 kul milakar bachaav paksh ne apane sawaalon ke zariye hedli ke aapraadhik itihaas or uske dohare charitra ko saamne laane ko koshish kii, taaki yah sabit ho sake ki hedli ke khulaason par aankh mundakar bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam appeared to give a clarification on this
 nikam ke mutabik hedli apradhi tha tabhi to 26 / 11 ke aatanki hamale main madad kii
 The prosecution and the defense in the court also had a significant knock
 yah maamla tab or garm ho gaya jab hedli ne apni patni se jude kisi bhi sawaal kaa jawaab dene se saafe inkaar kar diya tha
 Although Headley is a witness to the apology, but his callous attitude is saying something else
 adaalat ne bhi is baat ko notice kiya or hedli ko tokaa bhi

 On July 25, Modi attacked Nitish at his first rally in Muzaffarpur and said, "there is something wrong with the political DNA of Nitish Kumar
 ” tab kisne sochaa tha ki halke-phulke dhang se kahi yah baat argedy-jedy(you) kheme main “aahat bihari gaurav” ko lekar jabardast lamabandi kaa aujaar ban jaaegi
 Nitish claimed that his dishonor is insult to the whole of Bihar
 phir kya tha, lalu yadav or sonia gandhi isamen unke saath aa khadi huin
 Following Modi's tirade in Muzaffarpur, Nitish and Prashant Kishore were meeting people in remote areas of Bhagalpur
 kishor hi mukhyamantri ke jansampark se lekar chunaav abhiyaan or media tak sambhaal rahe hai
 a source close to him explains, “A Yadav farmer seemed extremely angry against Nitish on Modi's feet
 usne kaha ki “wo hamako dogala na kaha he
 "then we started asking ourselves whether people are so angry with Modi's talk
 “mere bihari diene main koi gadabadi nahin” abhiyaan yaheen se shuru hua
 "kishore worked closely with Modi in Gujarat from December 2011 until the 2014 Lok Sabha election victory and until recently he also helped informal debate on important issues related to the BJP
 unhone nitish or lalu donon ko bharosa dilaayaa he ki modi ne jo beijjati kii he, usamen ek nae “brands bihar” kaa beej chipa he or iske sahare jati or vikaas donon kii bhatthiyon ko ek saath dhadhkaya ja saktaa he
 Kishore felt that the tag of "self-respect" would directly challenge Modi's "parivartan" card
 nitish kii uplabdhiyaan or lalu kii jatiyon kii golbandi, donon milakar modi or unke gathbandhan sahyogiyon ko naakon chane chaba sakati he
 Not only this, it will fill nitish-lalu and his workers even more with enthusiasm
 lalu kii aakraamak or haal main taqatvar hui yadav birdari ke liye “bihar ke diene kii beijjati” main modi kii “56 inch ke seene” kii bambaari karne kaa muqabla karne kii kuvat he
 At the Patna rally last week, RJD youth activists were full of enthusiasm over Lalu's challenge to BJP President Amit Shah
 lalu ne shah ko “yaduwanshiyon ko todgaye ke liye” lalakaara tha
 Kishore's younger colleagues have formed the Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC), which is running Nitish's electoral machinery
 isse jude yuva kehete hai ki bihar jaise siyaasi taur par jaagruk soobe main shah se koi bhaybheet nahin he
 a slogan was coined on the same lines: "we will not fall into the trap, will win Nitish
" ” puure patna main yah ishtahaar lagava die gaye
 In addition to media and advertising, Kishore's team launched a campaign of digital messages via social media and mobile
 unhone harek nirvachan kshetra ke aankadon or vishleshan par jor diya
 The campaigns also include "har Ghar Dastak"
 isamen party kaa sandesh pahunchane ke liye kaaryakarta kam se kam 10 gharon main jate hai
 They have gone to one crore homes
 maje kii baat yah he ki kishor ke saathi bhi kabhi modi ke saath kaam kar chuke hai
 While Rishi Raj Singh was involved in Shah's campaign in UP, Prateek Jain was responsible for Maharashtra
 nitish kaa abhiyaan modi ke abhiyaan se kaise alag he, yah poochne par donon hans pade
 Jain said, "here we have to do everything ourselves
 patna main raily ke liye hamane manch par jhaadu lagaai, spikar or alsidi screen lagavai, pani-kursiyon kaa intjaam tak kiya
 It also told which speaker should speak after whom
 ” team ke ek or sadsy shashaank mehta kehete hai, “modi ke abhiyaan main sansadhano kii koi kami nahin thi
 Here, one has to step by blowing
 ”pichley aam chunaav main jedy(you) or argedy ne bijepi ke khilaaf chunaav ladgaye ke saath-saath ek duusare ke khilaaf bhi chunaav ladaa tha
 That means 17 percent of Muslims, 12 percent of Mahadalits and 27 percent of extremely backward castes were divided into very important votes
 nitish isse is kadar dar gaye the ki unhone mukhyamantri kii gaddi chhod us par jeethanram maanjhi ko baitha diya
 This move proved more devastating
 dilli main rajyasabha sadsy pawan verma ke ghar par disambar, 2014 main jab kishor or nitish pehali baar mili, to kishor ne unhen pehali baat yahi kahi ki unka mukhyamantri kii gaddi par lautnaa jaruri he
 After that, events happened rapidly
 nitish ne daraa-dhamkaakar maanjhi ko hataaya or phir mukhyamantri ban gaye
 He met Sonia Gandhi for the first time and agreed to a reconciliation with Lalu
 kabhi dushman raheen teenon partiyon ko samaj main aa gaya ki agar ve saath-saath doobana nahin chaahate, to unhen saath milakar tairnaa padegaa
 Nitish admits, “the reality is that we have to defeat the BJP, what enmity are we talking about
 ”april 2015 aate-aate bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak ke fouran baad kishor ne nitish ke chunaav abhiyaan kii kaman sanbhaalane kaa faisla kar liya
 This created panic in the BJP
 kishor andar kii bahut sari baaten jaanate the
 He was the same person who had launched a national campaign to "discuss tea", overturning Congress leader Mani Shankar Iyer's lewd remarks on Modi's tea sales as a child
 kai sau nirvachan kshetron main ek saath modi kii chamakati image dikhaane or bahasein karwaane kaa thridi hologram kaa vichaar bhi unheen ke dimag kii upaj tha
 What will he do with Nitish? Kishore officially declined to say anything, but suffice to say that his IPAC has an army of 800 people
 isamen iity or iiem kii digriyon se las yuva shaamil hai
 It has its headquarters on Strand Road, Patna
 yah siem house ke kareeb he
 Kishore used to work at Modi's house in Ahmedabad
 patna main bhi ve nitish ke ghar se kaam karte hai
 He has refined the achievements of Nitish so that the figures ready to air the allegations of BJP are in his hands
 kabhi-kabhaar jedy(you) main virodh kii budbudaahaten suni ja sakati hai ki ek gaiyr-siyaasi yuva utana badi samaajawaadee party main itnaa asardaar kaise ho gaya
 But seeing the party's campaign begin with a very strict strategy, these bubbles were silenced
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki bihar kii jang main daanv kaaphi oonche lage hai
 modi-shah's victory will not only ensure the strength of the BJP for the next several years, but will also destroy the opposition

 Sunil Kumar Singh has said that the rule of law will remain completely

 Laws are equal for everyone

 kisi bhi rishte kii neenv pyaar, bharose or sammaan par tiki hoti he
 It is the duty of every partner to understand the needs of the relationship and to take responsibility towards it
 lekin kuch aadaten aisi hoti hai jinaki vajah se rishton main daraar aa jaati he
 Let's know five things that can end a good relationship
 
 
 1
 Where there is love, there is also noose
 jahaan sahmati he vahaan asahmati bhi hoti he
 If you are facing any problem in your relationship, then sit and talk and try to find a solution immediately
 baton ko man main dabaakar rakhana ghaatak sabit hota he
 2
 jab kabhi partner ke saath nok-jhonk ho rahi ho to puraani baton ko yaad karke taane naa den
 Instead of paying attention to the things that have passed, try to improve tomorrow
 koi partner acha yaa bura nahin hota
 His actions can definitely be bad
 or agar donon ke bich pyaar ho to aadaten or harakatein badali ja sakati hai 
 But taunting old things hurts the partner's mind
 kidney ke bare main aap nahin jaanate honge ye 12 baaten3
 Your relationship with a partner is a very personal matter
 ise kisi ke saath share naa karen
 There are many times that we start telling friends about fights with partners
 isse rishta kharaab hota he or vishwaas kam hota he isliye personal maamle kitne bhi kharaab hon unhen public karne se bachanaa chahie
 Because if your relationship with the partner improves tomorrow, then you will not be troubled by those who know
 ye khaas cheez hameshaa bag main rakhti hai mahilaayein, ban chukaa he trend4
 Nobody likes the comparison
 kai baar jhunjhalaakar ham apane puraane pyaar ke aadhaar par partner ko jaj karne lag jate hai, usase tulana karne lag jate hai
 This is not true at all
 aapako samajhnaa chahie ki har vyakti alag hota he or rishte main thodaa bahut compromij karnaa padataa he
 5
 rishte main aksar kisi ek partner kaa swabhaav bosi ho jaataa he
 Which is not right
 iske alaava har baat par roak-tok or salaah dene se bachanaa chahie
 The partner also has a personal life that should be respected

 bhartiya cricket team ke pramukh gendbaaj jahir khan ne kaha he ki ran banane ke liye sangharsh karte australian ballebaaji kram ke khilaaf unki team swing ko apane pramukh hathiyaar ke taur par upyog main laaegi
 According to Zaheer, given the poor performance of the hosts against swing bowling in recent times, the Indian team can try this art prominently
 jahir ke mutabik bhartiya gendbaajon ke liye yah acchhee khabar he ki australian team ke sheersh kram ke ballebaajon ko apni takanic sudhaarney ke liye ballebaaji camp main shirkat karne ko kaha gaya he
 Zaheer said, "swing has always been our weapon
 jo khabaren aa rahi hai, ve nishchit taur par hamaare khilaadiyon ke liye hausala badhaane vaali hai
 Given the poor batting of the hosts in recent times, we will be mainly dependent on swing
 " "swing ke alaava ek gendbaaj ke liye sahi disha or lambaai kaa banaae rakhana jaruri he
 If a bowler takes care of this and swings his ball as well, then surely it can upset any batsman in the world

 lekin hairat kii baat to yah he ki na to mukhyamantri karyaalay or na hi sipiem mukhyalay sunami kii in tarangon ko bhaanp sakaa
 Members of the CPM Polit Bureau were busy looking at the masses from the high towers of Khamkhali

 Leaders like Prakash Karat, Sitaram Yechury, Biman Bose, Mohammad Salim can sit in television studios, give elaborate lectures on the poor and downtrodden
 lekin in logon ne is baat kaa ratti bhar bhi prayaas nahin kiya ki jo ye janata ke bich bolte hai, use amalijama pahanaaya jaae
 Is CPM general secretary Prakash Karat able to face any dedicated party cadre today? Can they present a clarification on the issue of withdrawal of support from the UPA on the nuclear deal, which in a way pushed the UPA government towards the mid-term elections

 This is the result of the struggle of the woman who resolved not to enter the Writers' Building until she became the Chief Minister
 19 saal pehle tatkaaleen mukhyamantri jyoti basu ke chember ke saamne mamata banerjee ek balaatkaar peedit mahila ke liye nyaay kii fariyaad lekar gai thim
 Then Jyoti Basu not only ignored them but also removed them from the dharna
 ab mamata banerjee riters building main phir se daakhil ho rahi hai, mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene ke liye
 When Krishna came to know about Draupadi's rip off, he warned the Kauravas - "never hurt a woman's self-esteem, because there will be no limit to her vengeance

 Jayalalithaa's story is very similar

 Can we ever forget how Karunanidhi was dragged out of the house on charges of bribe by the police
 yah maananaa bhi galat hoga ki pichley kuch saalon main jayalalita kisi kam tiraskaar kii shikaar hui hai
 From this, one can easily guess what kind of revenge politics can be seen in the coming days

 Now the future of West Bengal and the destiny of its residents is completely dependent on how Mamata Banerjee performs
 jahaan tak janata kii baat he, vah mamata banerjee main apana yakeen vot ke jariye jataa chuki he
 Now Mamta Banerjee has to prove that she is a qualified and determined administrator
 aise kai sawaal hai jinke jawaab aane vaale dinon main hi mil paaenge-kya berozegaar yuvakon ko rojgaar die jaaenge, jaisaa ki vaada kiya gaya tha? kya kisaan apni upaj badhaane ke liye acchhee sinchai suvidha paa sakenge? kya rajya main nivesh kii raftaar jor pakad sakegi? kya janata mamata banerjee main bharosa barkaraar rakh sakegi, jo ki rail mantri ke rup main kai ahm maukon par anupasthit rahakar janata kii ankhon main khatkati rahi hai
 The biggest question before Jayalalithaa will be whether she can prove herself an honest administrator
 kya jayalalita badale kii raajnneeti ko tyagkar vikaas par dhyaan kendrit kar sakengi? yah aisa sawaal he, jiskaa jawaab khud jayalalita hi de sakati hai
 Here one cannot ignore the fact that India is truly a democratic country

 ’ On May 26, Wing Commander Suresh Karnik (retd) refused to attend the function to be held in Pune on May 28, in which Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar was the chief guest
 1971 ke yuddh ke dauraan pakistani thikaanon par bambaari karne ke liye vir chakra se sammanit 80 varshiya wing commander sainya bujurgon ke liye ek rank, ek pension lagu karne main parrikar kii deree se naaraaz the
 This policy will ensure that elderly military personnel like Karnik — who retired in 1983 — will receive the same pension as those who retire today
 kaarnik ne india today se kaha, "sashastr balon ke prati hamaare netaaon kii niti 'nato' kii he
 "NATO Mane 'no Action, Talk Only
" 'aise kai jumale us endie ke liye taiyaar hai, jisane apane chunavi ghoshnaptr main ek rank, ek pension kaa vaada kiya tha
 Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Member of Parliament's Standing Committee on Defense Affairs and Rajya Sabha MP, says, "one rank, one pension has become a concrete issue of the government's commitment to the armed forces
 "parrikar ab tak bahut dakshata se upie ke jamaane kii teen uljhi ganthon main se do sulajhaa chuke hai—64,000 sainikon vaali mountain strike kor kii sankhya unhone aadhi kar di, kyonki upie ne bajet main vruddhi kiye bina hi ise manjuuri de di thi
 Secondly, the purchase of 126 Rafale fighters was reduced to 36 aircraft

 The third financially burdensome proposal of the UPA era was - giving a rank, a pension, from 1 April 2014

 It was proposed more than that
 isaki ghoshnaa karne main endie kii deree se sashastr balon ke bheetar andeh paidaa ho rahaa he
 Major General Satbir Singh (retd), President of the Indian ex-servicemen Movement (IESM), says, "as far as we are concerned, there is no difference between UPA and NDA
 "sach kahen to parrikar ko vah samasya viraasat main mili he, jo kai dashak puraani he
 Since 1973, every consecutive Pay Commission has widened the gap between pensioners
 nateeja yah he ki 1996 se pehle avkaash grahan karne vaale kisi major general ko aaj usase bhi kam pension milti he, jo 1996 ke baad sevanivrutt hone vaale kisi leftinent karnal ko milti he
 All the governments so far have refused to bridge the gap citing the fact that it is a huge financial burden and then other services will demand the same
 parrikar ek rank, ek pension ko manjuuri nahin dene ke liye endie par hamalaa karne vaale congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par jamkar barase
 Parrikar told a news agency, pointing out that the money was hurdle, "rahul says he has paid 500 crore
 kaa praavdhaan kiya tha
 If the talk was 500 crores
 kii ho, to main kal is par hastakshar kar duungaa
 "last year, the Ministry of Defense assessed that it would have to pay Rs 8,300 crore to implement one rank, one pension
 kaa har saal bhugtan karnaa hoga
 Parrikar has cited the special condition of the armed forces advocating one rank, one pension
 sashastr balon ke 80 fisadi se adhik karmi 35 saal kii umr se ritair hone lagate hai, jabaki anya sarkari karmchaaree 60 saal kii umr tak seva main rahete hai
 On March 17 this year, the Defense Minister has signed the file and sent it to the Ministry of Finance
 mana jaataa he ki vitt mantralay ne is file par laal nishaan laga diya he
 Opposition grounds are not new
 agar sarkaar sevanivritti sanyakarmiyon ko baraabar pension detii he, to isse adrdhsainik balon kii ore se bhi isi tarah kii maang uthegi
 Sources indicate that the delay in one rank, one pension is being done because it will be merged with the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission for Central Government employees
 isaki report sarkaar ko aktubar tak prastut kii jaaegi or ayog 1 janvari, 2016 se prabhaav main aa jayega
 Starting in 2008, 22,000 ex-servicemen have submitted their medals at Rashtrapati Bhavan in protest against the upa's refusal to give one rank, one pension
 2011 main jab raashtrapati bhawan ne padak jamaa karnaa band kar diya, tab se dilli main iiesam ke offis main 10,000 se adhik padakon kaa dher lag chukaa he
 In 2014, when the UPA gave indicative consent to give one rank, one pension, it was a very small step taken very late
 tab tak endie yah samaj chukaa tha ki pension ek bhaavnaatmak chunavi mudda he
 In April last year, Narendra Modi, who was then nda's prime ministerial candidate, announced his support for a rank, a pension, at an ex-servicemen rally in Rewari Haryana
 isse bujurg sanyakarmiyon kii ummiden phir se jaag gayi

 satbir singh kehete hai, "9 disambar, 2014 ko unhone hamen aashwaasan diya ki yah kaam 31 janvari, 2015 tak ho jayega
 On 1 February, he said that it will be on 28 February
 phir 2 march ko unhone kaha ki yah 31 march ko or antat 14 april ko kaha ki 30 april ko ghoshnaa ho jaaegi
 "groups of elderly military personnel struggling to be given a rank, a pension since 2008, including the IESM, have called a meeting in Delhi on 6 June to decide their future plans of action

 Mumbai Indians batsman Hardik Pandya played the innings which helped Mumbai Indians win against Kolkata Knight Riders
 mahaj 31 gend par pandya ne naabad 61 ran thok die
 In this innings he hit 8 fours and 2 vigorous sixes
 pandya kii pari kii ahmiyat kaa andaja isse lagaaya ja saktaa he ki 12wein over main jab ve ballebaazi karne ke liye utre tab mumbai kaa score chaar wicket par 79 ran tha or jab ve pavilion waapas laute tab mumbai kaa score 20 over main 171 ran tak pahunch chukaa tha
 The comments pandya ne is joardaar andaaj main ballebaazi kii ki duusare chor par kirone pollard fike dikhaai dene lage
 One of the main reasons for this strong batting of Pandya was his own confidence and desire to play vigorous shots
 lekin isse bhi badi ek vajah thi
 What was she? To this, Pandya told in an interview to IPL T20
com, 'before landing for batting, i requested team coach Ricky Ponting to sit next to me for five minutes'
 ponting ne aisa hi kiya or isse pandya kaa bharosa aisa majboot hua ki unhone andre rasel or umesh yadav jaise gendbaazon par manamafik shats khele
 Ponting told Pandya during these five minutes, 'take time on the wicket and relieve the pressure and enjoy your game
 agar tum aisa kar paae to tum joardaar shats laga paaoge
 ' pandya ke liye ponting kii ye salaah kaam kar gai
 Anyway, Mumbai Indians coach Ricky Panting has praised Hardik Pandya earlier
 chennai super kings ke khilaaf bhi pandya ne 8 gend par 21 ran banaakar apni team ko jeet dilaai thi
 Earlier, in the match against Bangalore, Pandya scored 16 runs from just 6 balls
 21 saal ke pandya ne ipel main apana pehla sijan khel rahe hai or mahaj 6 maichon ke baad ve is sijan ke sabase ubharate star banakar ubhare hai
 Pandya batted in such a vigorous manner that Kieron Pollard faded at the other end
 pandya kii is joardaar ballebaazi kii ahm vajahon main unka khud kaa bharosa or joardaar shats khilne kii chahat thi
 But there was a bigger reason
 wo kya thi? is par pandya ne ipel tii20 dotcom ko die intervyuu main bataaya he, 'ballebaazi ke liye utarane se pehle maine team ke coach riki ponting se anurodh kiya tha ki ve meri bagal main paanch minute ke liye baithen' Ponting did the same and this reinforced Pandya's confidence that he played the desired shots at bowlers like Andre Russell and Umesh Yadav
 ponting ne in paanch minute ke dauraan pandya se kaha, 'wicket par samay lenaa or dabaav mukt hokar apane khel kaa lutf uthaanaa
 If you can do this, then you will be able to hit strongly
 ' Ponting's advice worked for Pandya
 vaise bhi darasal mumbai indiens ke coach riki panting hardik pandya kii pehle bhi tarif kar chuke hai
 Even against Chennai Super Kings, Pandya made his team win by scoring 21 runs off 8 balls
 isse pehle bangalore ke khilaaf muqaabale main bhi pandya ne mahaj 6 gend par 16 ran banaae the
 The 21-year-old Pandya is playing his first season in the IPL and after just 6 matches, he has emerged as the hottest rising star of the season
 ponting ne aisa hi kiya or isse pandya kaa bharosa aisa majboot hua ki unhone andre rasel or umesh yadav jaise gendbaazon par manamafik shats khele
 Ponting told Pandya during these five minutes, 'take time on the wicket and relieve the pressure and enjoy your game
 agar tum aisa kar paae to tum joardaar shats laga paaoge

 ' jab main 5veen class main padhati thi to achaanak hamaare class main ek din hamalogon se umr main kaaphi badi ladki ko dekhakar ham hairaan rah gaye
 Dark face, vermilion on forehead, bangles in hand - she looked exactly like a married woman
 bas sari kii jagah skool ke dress main thi
 Usually, when a new student took admission in the school, we started talking to him as soon as possible but there was nothing like that here
 ulta ham log is vichaar main rahete the ki use kaise pareshaan kiya jaae ki vah skool chhodkar chali jaae
 She was always studying
 hamaare class main zyaadaatar bachche samaaj ke tathakthith oonchi jati se hi aate the or vah ek dalit parivaar se thi
 Due to this we also used to have a lot of distance
 na to ham uske saath baithkar lunch hi karte the or na hi chocolate share karte the
 As soon as the month of January started, preparations for the Republic Day started in the school
 hamalogon ne sangeet-nrity main bhaag liya or usne bhi liya, jo hamen gavaara nahin tha

 The first dance was on 'ye Desh Hai Veer Jawan Ka'
 usne is geet par aisi parformens di thi ki duusare din gaanv main sirf usee ke charche ho rahe the lekin ye charche positive kam negative zyada tha
 Everyone was blaming our school director as to how far it was appropriate to bring a married Dalit girl on stage, but after that day she became the most favorite of us
 ham sab saath hi khaanaa khaane lage the lekin chup-chup kar kyonki dar lagata tha ki agar kisi ne hamaare ghar main bataa diya to kya hoga? jabaki sachai to yah thi ki mere ghar main jaat-paat nahin mana jaataa tha phir bhi mere andar yah cheez ghar kar chuki thi ki hamaare samaaj ke mutabik ham or wo ek jaise nahin hai
 Meanwhile, he was going to be secondary
 hamalogon ne sochaa ki vah to sasuraal ja rahi he to usko gift ke rup main kya dena chahie or humlog uske ghar tak kaise pahonchege kyonki hamaare kai saheliyon ke gharavaalon ne uske ghar jane se saaf manaa kar diya tha
 But we had decided that we would definitely go to her house and all the friends agreed that we would go but would not eat anything at her house
 hamalogon ne use gift dene ke liye chudiyaan, lipistic or kapiyaan kharidi thim
 We had not grown up enough to think that she was going to her in-laws and would not study further, so these copies have no meaning for her now
 ham jaise hi uske ghar pahunche, vah daudkar hamaari taraf ai, apane kamare le gai
 There were lots of sweets, he told us to eat but all of us made excuses
 mujhe yaad he ki vah samaj chuki thi ham khaane se kyon manaa kar rahe hai, uski ankhen bhar ain thi
 i could not see this face of hers, i considered myself a criminal and this guilt will dominate me all my life
 lekin salaam he meri us bahadur saheli ko ki jisane sasuraal main bhi apni padhai jari rakhi
 Despite being a mother of two children, she passed 12th and took admission in graduation
 mere paas aaj uskaa koi contact number nahin he lekin main jaanati hum ki vah jahaan kahin bhi hogi apane saath dusron kii jindagi bhi or behatar banane main juty hogi

 unhone kolkata main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki aaj vipaksh desh ke saath nahin sarhad paar baithe aatankwaadiyon ke saath he
 During this period, PM Modi also talked about the air strikes made after the Pulwama attack and the strike in space a few days ago
 unhone raily ke dauraan congress ke menifesto ko dhakosla patr bataaya
 PM Modi said that it is not possible to fulfill all the promises that the Congress has made in its cheat letter
 congress sirf aapse jhooth bolkar aapkaa vot lenaa chaahati he
 Addressing the rally, PM Modi said that whether it is a strike or an air strike or a strike in space, all this is possible because of you
 aapaki vajah se maine yah sab naammumkin se mumkin banaaya he
 Whatever has happened within five years is not done by Modi but by you
 ye sab aapke aashirwad ke kaaran hua he
 PM Modi (PM Modi) said that some people in the country started opposing Mother Bharati, opposing Modi
 ye bataaiye air strike saboot koun maang rahaa tha, sena ko niraash koun kar rahaa tha
 Show the dead bodies of the terrorists, who said this
 sapooton se saboot maangane kaa paap koun kar rahaa tha
 This is an insult to Bablu Santra in Pulwama
 unhone kaha ki bharat ke vaigyanikon ne missile se satellite udaane kaa kaam kiya
 We became the fourth such country
 lekin vipaksh ko garv nahin hua he
 But it has also been called a drama by the opposition
 aapkaa yah chaukeedaar jo paanch varsh se kar rahaa he uskaa samarth is paanch varsh main hi nahin aayaa he
 Our soldiers had the power of air strike earlier too, but during that time no one had shown courage to do it
 pie modi ne congress ke menifesto ko lekar kaha ki congress party ne kal jo menifesto rakhaa vah ek dhakosla patr he
 According to the promise made by the Congress in this, if he comes to power, he will remove the security cover of the army

 Therefore, he took such a step against the army
 piem modi (PM Modi) ne aage kaha ki vot bank ke liye congress hameshaa aisa karti he
 She seems to be supporting the separatists in the power-hungry
 congress ke saath trinmul party bhi he
 This is also the reason for the Citizenship Amendment Act
 kanoon hamaari sarkaar ne bhi khatm kiye hai
 But it was such laws that made life easier for the common people
 hamanen kul 1400 kanoon khatm kiya
 So that people benefit
 lekin congress jo kar rahi he vah hamaare javaanon kaa manobal todta he
 Weakens them
 piem modi (PM Modi) ne kaha ki aapkaa yah chaukeedaarcongress kaa dhakosla patr or desh kii suraksha ke bich ek diwaar banakar khadaa he
 This Modi will never let Congress conspiracies succeed
 is dhakosla patr kii expyri date pehle se hi tay he taarikh he 23 may
 Congress also went to his cheating letter
 desh kii janata pehle hi isapar muhar laga chuki thi
 At some point in time, some people were heard listening to Modi on a stage in Bengal

 Is it a crime to give a house to the poor, if it is a crime then i have done it
 garibon ko shauchalay dena gunaah he to maine kiya he, garibon ko rasoi gas dena gunaah he to maine kiya he
 It is a crime to give free treatment to the poor, so i have done it
 namumikin ab mumkin he
 PM Modi said that the situation in West Bengal today was the same situation in Tripura
 tripura ne khudako laal bediyon se mukt kiya
 This was also impossible
 aaj tripura teji se vikaas kar rahaa he
 As Bengal Sarkara has not given the benefit of Seventh Pay Commission till date, some similar situation was also in the Left Government of Tripura
 ham aae to hamanen tripura main diya
 Our government proves the resolve it takes
 paanch varsh pehle kisi ne sochaa tha ki paanch lakh rupee tak inakam tex maaf hoga
 But we have done it
 paanch varsh pehle kisi ne sochaa tha samaanya varg ke garibon ko bhi aarakshan mil saktaa he
 Today we gave reservation
 paanch varsh pehle kisi ne sochaa tha khudako bharat kaa bhaagyavidhaataa samajhane vaala parivaar kaa bhi insaaf hoga
 Today the whole family is out on bail
 unhone kaha ki bengal kii janata ne man bana liya he
 Now this Tollagiri will go to Gundagiri
 ab ham auki aap ek aisa bengal banaaenge jo tiemasi ke gunda raaj se mukt hoga

 com / ixeajcvz61 This time the discussion of the no confidence motion brought by the opposition in the monsoon session of Parliament was in full swing and the Modi government managed to get the confidence vote quite easily
 magar ek vakt aisa bhi tha, jab atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv main endie sarkaar ko sadan main bahumat sabit karnaa padaa tha or is agni pariksha main atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar vifal sabit hui thi or mahaj ek vot se unki sarkaar gir gai thi
 The matter was actually in 1999, when the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Jayalalithaa separated her party from the NDA and the Vajpayee government was forced to prove its trust vote
 darasal, 1998 ke aam chunaav main kisi bhi party ko puri tarah bahumat nahin mila tha magar, AIADMK ke samarthan se endie ne centre main sarkaar banaai thi
 Nearly 13 months later, in April 1999, the late leader Jayalalithaa's party AIADMK withdrew its support from the Vajpayee government, and the government came to a minority
 iske baad phir raashtrapati ne sarkaar ko apana bahumat sabit karne ke liye kaha
 After which the Vajpayee government had to submit a motion of confidence
 iske baad se sansad ke galiyaaron main gahamagahami shuru ho gai thi
 On 17 April 1999 when the Lok Sabha voted on the no-confidence motion, the government lost by a single vote and thus the government fell
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki us vakt odisha ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri giradhar gamang ne sarkaar ke khilaaf vot diya tha
