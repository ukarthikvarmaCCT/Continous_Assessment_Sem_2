 Even if one or two people get hanged for this, the rape incident in the country is not going to stop

 Innocent can not be implicated through these tests, while criminals also cannot avoid it
 saath hi isse rape maamle main jaanch me teji aegi or jald hi usko sajaa bhi mil sakegi
 Along with the demand for making new laws, Ashwani Upadhyay has also demanded to end the mercy petition
 unhone kaha ki jab lower court se lekar supreme court is maamle main sajaa detii he to phir dayaa yachika kaa matlab kya he isliye isko turant khatm kar dena chahie

 So unless there is a total judicial reform in India, the Ram Rajya cannot come, which we imagine

 - input language congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne sonia gandhi se chuttee maangi he baahar ja kar chintan manan karne ke liye
 This holiday is sought by Rahul when the budget session of Parliament has started and Anna Hazare is sitting on a dharna in Ramlila Maidan against the land acquisition bill of NDA government
 yah vahi mudda he jis par rahul gandhi uttar pradesh ke bhatta parsul main prardashan kar chuke hai
 Why did Rahul need a holiday right now
 kya congress main sabakuch thikthak nahin he, kyonki bhala rahul gandhi ko sonia se chuttee kyon maangani padi? ek to wo kisi skool main nahin pard rahe hai or na hi sonia gandhi koi teacher he
 Congress Gandhi has its own party, even if Rahul went on leave without asking, no one could stop
 ab sabase bada sawaal he ki kya rahul naaraaz ho kar chuttee par gaye hai
 Is Rahul not getting the discounts he wants in the party? tikat bantwaare main rahul kii naa sunanaa or haar ke baad unpar thikra phodna rajyon ke netaaon ko zyada takat dena jaise kuch mudde hai jisapar rahul party main akele pad jate hai
 Do all the big leaders sitting in the Congress office plot against him? Is Rahul Gandhi upset with the factionalism of Congress leaders in the states? After every defeat, Rahul is hurt by the poster of Priyanka Lao Congress Bachao outside the Congress office
 
 
 ? a senior Congress leader told in the Central Hall that if Rahul is angry then he has done well
 is mudde par congress puri tarah se banty hui he
 a faction that is with Rahul is calling it self-contemplation before general reflection
 doosraa gut maje le rahaa he
 It is also true that in recent times many Congress leaders have left the party due to many reasons like Chaudhary Virendra in Haryana, Krishna Tirath in Delhi, Jayanthi Natarajan in Tamil Nadu etc
 kuch dabi jubaan main rahul kaa virodh karte hai to chindbaram ke bete media main bayaan de dete hai
 Congress has to prove itself again or else people have the option of Aam Aadmi Party
 ab dikkat he ki rahul ye sab karenge kaise kyonki kaha ja rahaa he ki april main unhen congress kaa adhyaksh banaaya ja rahaa he
 Before this occasion, Rahul's going on self-thinking, thinking in private, which way does Ishara? Can they reject the post of president? i don't know the real thing only Rahul can tell

 Exactly 50 years ago, on July 26, he took command of the DMK
 lambey samay tak karunanidhi ke naam har chunaav main apni seat na haarane kaa record bhi rahaa
 He has been Chief Minister five times and Member of Legislative Assembly 12 times
 abhi tak vah jis bhi seat par chunaav lade hai, unhone hameshaa jeet darj kii he
 Karunanidhi held the post of CM of the state for the first time in 1969, followed by the last time in 2003 as Chief Minister

 With the intention of stepping up to the Prime Minister's chair, Rahul Gandhi tried to win elections in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 do saal kii koshish or samay kharch karne ke baad ab unki samaj main aayaa he ki ganga pattee main apni manzil tak pahunchane ke liye unke paas na to koi sawari he, na hi disha

 This is exactly what happened to the Congress
 rahul gandhi yuva nahin hai
 He is 41 years old
 is umr main unke parnana jawaharlal nehru ne 1929 ke aitihaasik lahore adhiveshan kii adhyakshata kii thi or unhone apane rajnatik sangrakshak mahatma gandhi ke sanshay ke baavjoodswaraj kaa prastaav paarit karavaaya tha
 Due to this proposal, the Congress demanded complete independence from the British government
 jawaharlal nehru ne prashikshu netaaon ke naaron ke bal par nahin balki apane vichaaron ke boote rashtriya andolan main apni sheersh jagah banaai thi
 Jawaharlal was enlightened
 unhone sampannataa or gaanv kii garibi, donon dekhi thi
 So they felt comfortable in both types of environment
 unhone apni raajnneeti kisaanon or mahatma gandhi ke saath-saath us pracheen manishi chanakya se bhi sikhi thi, jinke ve prashansak the

 He conducted his strategy from the center
 dilli main satta peeth ke aaramdaayak kamaron se unhone chapatti ko ek abujh paheli main badal diya
 His advisors thought that every geographical area or community could be managed through money, illusion or emotional protection

 There will be 69 Muslim mlas in this Assembly of Uttar Pradesh which is their largest number till date

 After the entire blast quartet of Congress, four of its 28 mlas are Muslims

 There can be a lesson in this somewhere
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne sochaa ki sankat gambhir he
 So serious that a press conference should be held
 isamen unhone jo vichaar vyakt kiya usase unke party sahyogiyon kii raaton kii neend haraam ho gai hogi
 Sonia said that the problem is not the lack of leadership, but the mob of leaders
 lekin yah party kii apni chintaa he
 The Congress president's strong comment was that there is still an opportunity for the UPA to rectify its mistakes as the next general elections are due in 2014
 ho saktaa he ki unke paas kolkata se khabar na pahunchi ho
 His colleague Mamata Banerjee openly celebrated Mulayam Singh Yadav's victory in Uttar Pradesh

 The UPA will undergo a rigorous electoral examination in the presidential election this July, long before the 2014 general elections

 2009 ke baad congress ne apane sahyogi dalon ko alag-thalag karne ke liye sab kuch kiya
 She reprimanded even those parties who could join hands if needed
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki duusari partiyon ne apane liye aisi jagah bana lee jahaan sattarudh gathbandhan main shaamil ghatak congress se ub kar kabhi-kabhaar sukun mahasoos kar sakate hai
 Parties like the DMK who are unable to dare to come out of the alliance, are sitting indifferent like sacrificial goats
 congress ne apane sahyogi dalon ko raste par laane ke liye tex adhikariyon kaa istemaal kiya he
 But this way of that is not right
 jin partiyon ke paas chup rahane ke sivaay koi vikalp nahin tha, unhone sahi maukey kaa intjaar karnaa munasib samajha
 That perfect opportunity may come this summer
 sidhe-sade rajnatik ganit ke rup main dekhen to congress ke saath judaav dhire-dhire boj banataa ja rahaa he

 Regardless of the contradictions between Jaganmohan Reddy, Chandrababu Naidu, Naveen Patnaik, Prakash Karat, Nitin Gadkari, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati, Prakash Singh Badal and Om Prakash Chautala, they all want elections at a time when the Congress is very weak
 congress 2012 ke dauraan uttar pradesh-punjab ke bukamp ke jhtke se ubar nahin paaegi
 His recovery may begin in 2013
 phir ladaake sahyogi dalon or vipaksh ke ye netaa 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav kaa intjaar kyon karen?agar unhone raashtrapati pad ke liye saajha ummidavaar khadaa kiya to congress ke liye sankat paidaa ho saktaa he
 Even without the Rajya Sabha elections due in April (in which the Congress will slip further), the UPA situation will be in a shambles

 Punjab is also a cause of great distress where the Congress started celebrating long before the votes were cast

 In fact, the akali-bjp alliance increased its vote among Hindu Dalits, Hindu obcs, Sikh obcs and Sikh Dalits

 rahul gandhi ne uttar pradesh main haar ke liye party kii buniyadi sanrachana ko doshi tehraaya he, lekin kya unhone apni party kii sheersh kii sanrachana par gaur kiya he? congress kaa koi bhi diggaj netaa itnaa kaddavar nahin he ki vah apane rajya main party ko ubaar sake yaa use kam-se-kam sammanjanak sthiti main laa sake
 Then why blame the basic level workers? The Congress can claim that it sent a corrupt minister of the Central Cabinet to jail, but why did she forget to arrest her Chief Minister in Goa, who has been sent into exile by voters for a long time
 isamen shaq nahin ki congress ubar sakati he
 But he has to be truly liberal and democratic in terms of morality as before
 vah yaa to rashtriya trust ban sakati he yaa paariwarik sampatti, donon nahin
 Here the fact is irrelevant that the other parties are being run by the family
 uttar pradesh ke chunaav main kai mode aae
 One of them was the arrival of Priyanka Gandhi's husband Robert Vadra and the younger children of both of them to Rae Bareli
 iske jariye matadaataaon ko 2030 ke liye agrim notice diya ja rahaa tha

 Priya Sehgal Congress: In the day in Uttar Pradesh, Rahul Gandhi changed another disguise
 yah bhes kisi engri yangamain kaa nahin, balki ek sharminda yuva kaa tha, jo 6 march kii dopaher ko media se mukhaatib hua tha
 The beard was still growing
 rahul ne kaha, ‘chunaav abhiyaan kaa netritv maine kiya tha, isliye yah (haar) meri jimmedaari he
 'and after that he also surprisingly added a sense of wisdom
 vah yah ki ‘nattejey mere liye acha sabak hai
 Patting the back of one journalist and shaking hands with another, he went back to 10 Janpath, where Priyanka hugged and comforted her desperate brother
 pradhanmantri ke pad par rahul kii tajposhi kii disha main pehle kadam ke taur par uttar pradesh main congress main nai jaan foonki jaani thi
 For this reason, Rahul was not projected as the chief ministerial candidate in Uttar Pradesh despite demands from several candidates
 elahabaad se chunaav haare congress ke ek ummidavaar bataate hai, ‘hamase kaha gaya tha ki rahul gandhi rashtriya netaa hai, jinhen kisi ek rajya tak simit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The shameful defeat in Uttar Pradesh has put Rahul Gandhi's national interests on hold
 rahul pehle hi apane war room ko gujarat le ja chuke hai
 Elections in this state, along with Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh, are due early next year
 in teenon rajyon main bhaajapa kaa shashan he, lekin asli muqabla gujarat main he
 If Rahul manages to snatch this state from Narendra Modi, he will get back the prestige he has lost in Uttar Pradesh
 parivaar par congress kii nirbharta ko dekhte hue, 2014 main bhi party ke star prachaarak rahul hi rahenge
 But whether or not he will be projected as a prime ministerial candidate will depend on how the Congress performs in these elections and the subsequent Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan elections to be held in late 2013
 agar yahi score card phir doharaaya gaya, to is baat kii sambhaavna zyada hogi ki rahul pradhanmantri banane kii apni hasaraton ko 2019 ke liye sthagit kar den or uske sthaan par manmohan singh-sonia gandhi kism kii koi vyavastha apana lee jaae
 Such jokes have already started on the SMS that the defeat in Uttar Pradesh has extended the political tenure of Manmohan Singh
 rochak baat he ki 7 march ko yah puche jane par ki 2014 main congress kaa pradhanmantri pad kaa daavedaar koun hoga, sonia gandhi ne yah kehete hue golmol-sa jawaab diya tha ki ‘abhi to 2012 chal rahaa he
 'senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar told the media,' Rahul could easily sit on the post of Prime Minister
 isaki bajaae unhone jameen par kaam karne kaa faisla kiya or sabase kathin maidan chunaa
 He recalls how the Congress lost Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh elections in 1983 under the leadership of the late Rajiv Gandhi
 iske baavjood congress ke bheetar rajeev kii haisiyat nirvivaad rahi
 Similarly, no one blamed Rahul for the current defeat
 iske vipareet, kai congressi sara dosha apane sir par lene ke liye hode main hai
 Rahul has also stumbled before
 2010 main bihar main party ke vinaashkari chunaav abhiyaan kaa netritv unheen ne kiya tha
 There they are yet to prepare the leadership of the state level
 lekin uttar pradesh kaa jhatka bihar se kahin bada tha
 This is the state he made his karmabhoomi
 congress ke ek mahasachiv bataate hai ki ve jald hi phir uttar pradesh jaaenge or ve sthaneey netritv kii ek qatari khadi karne ke liye utsuk hai
 According to these general secretaries, Rahul is considering presenting one of the three Union ministers - RPN Singh, Jitin Prasad or Pradeep Jain as the state Congress president
 rahul ne uttar pradesh se jo sabak siikhe hai, unamem se ek sabak yah he ki chunaav jeetne ke liye rajya main ek vishwasaneey netaa kii jarurat hoti he
 The current leadership of the state is led by Congress Legislature Party leader Pramod Tiwari and State Congress Committee Chairman Rita bahuguna-joshi
 donon apane nirvachan kshetra ko chhodkar kahin se chunaav nahin jeet sakate
 a local Congress leader says, "ritaji knows how Indiraji ditched her father (hemvati Nandan Bahuguna)
 unhen pataa he ki bade kad kaa netaa hona congress main kitna khatarnaak hota he
 'rahul enjoyed his self-proclaimed role as the great defender of this Hindi speaking region
 rahul ab jaanate hai ki rajya kii dahalij chhukar bhaag jane vaale unke dauron se koi laabh nahin hua he
 If the Congress wants to return to the state, it needs strong local leadership
 rahul kii krupa kar dene ke andaaj kii raajnneeti ko-uttar pradesh ke ek varg ke liye ek package kaa vaada karnaa, duusare ke liye aarakshan kii jugad karnaa or tisare ke liye ek jatigat cheharaa pesh karnaa-rajya ke logon ne jaahiri taur par thukraa diya he
 The problem with Rahul is that he thinks in English and then translates his thoughts into Hindi
 14 november ko phulpur main raily ke dauraan uttar pradesh ke logon ko bhikhaari kah dene kii sharmnaak ghatana isi kaaran ghati thi
 a Lucknow-based congressman explains, "they really wanted to say that Uttar Pradesh should provide so many employment opportunities that people here do not have to go out for work
" ’ sanyogvash, jo sandesh sunai diya tha, vah yah nahin tha
 Due to this gap of dialogue, Rahul's speeches often seem more like discourse rather than emotional engagement with voters
 sonia gandhi kah chuki hai ki uttar pradesh main samasya yah thi ki vahaan ‘jarurat se zyada netaa the
 'if Rahul wants to succeed as a party leader, he should re-evaluate his team of advisors
 chunaav ke baad rahul ne media ke chune hue logon ke saath baatcheet main kaha ki ve chaahate the ki unhen mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar ke taur par pesh kiya jaae, lekin unki party ke netaaon kii raay iske viruddh thi
 Instead of giving Rahul the chance to wander in the wrong direction, he should have listened to his inner self
 iske alaava, mayawati ne yah baat saamne rakhi he ki congress party kii aarakshan kii raajnneeti musalamaanon ko pakke taur par samaajawaadee party ke kheme main dhakelne main safal rahi he
 This politics of reservation was initiated by Cabinet Minister Salman Khurshid and senior leader Digvijay Singh
 digvijay sawaal karte hai, ‘hamane sirf 4
 Samajwadi Party talked about 18 percent reservation, 5 percent reservation was talked about
 to aap kaise kah sakate hai ki isse hamen nuksaan hua?’lekin unke dhany-dhany karte bayanon ne congress ke chunaav prachaar ko gambhir nuksaan pahunchaaya tha
 If the loss was not caused by Digvijay's statement of implementing the governor's rule, Khurshid's claim that Sonia wept after seeing pictures of the Batla House encounter
 isi jhund main shaamil hone ke liye betaab ek or cabinet mantri, shriprakash jaiswal ne daawa kiya ki ‘rahul agar chahen, to ve aadhi raat ko bhi pradhanmantri ban sakate hai
 'this kind of arrogance has been rejected by voters of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa and even Uttarakhand on a large scale
 gandhi parivaar ke paas raaj karne kaa khandaani adhikaar ab nahin rah gaya he, yahaan tak ki amethi or raibareli kii khandaani milkiyat main bhi nahin
 More than this, Rahul's image of an angry young man surprised the voters of Uttar Pradesh instead of uniting them
 badi hui dadhi or kurte kii chadhaai hui baahon se unki yah chhavi banaai gai thi
 BJP leader Kesharinath Tripathi from Allahabad says, 'the image of Amitabh Bachchan with an angry young man used to attract a generation ago
 aaj kaa yuva bhinn he or uskaa drushtikon kahin vyapak he
 This image of Rahul Gandhi was the brainchild of Congress MP and film actor Raj Babbar, who went out on the day the election results were out
 babbar khud bhi amitabh kii peedi ke abhinayta hai
 It is no surprise then that the stakes of such a look went in vain
 haalanki sonia ne khud ko prishthbhumi main rakhte hue apane bete ko vidhansabha chunaavon ke maujuuda daur main party kaa netritv karne kii chhot di thi, lekin buree tarah mili paraajay ne sonia ko phir baahar aane ke liye majaboor kar diya he
 He has drawn Congressmen and told them to 'be ready'

 Ashit Jolly and Priya Sehgal on the afternoon of 6 March
 assi baras se zyada ke ho chuke mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ko satta main waapas lautne kii khabar kii ummid shaayad nahin thi
 But when the election results announced it, there was a celebration in his village
 mukhyamantri ek khuli jeep par savaar hue or unhone apane gaanv badal main 30 minute kaa vijay juluus nikaala
 This is the same village from where he started his political journey in 1947 as a sarpanch
 unke peeche jeet kii khushi main nagaade bajaati bheed thi
 The opposite was true of the residence of Congress's Chief Ministerial candidate Amarinder Singh
 yahaan 30 janvari ko vot padane ke baad se hi jashn kaa maahaul tha
 But on March 6, 15 minutes after the counting of votes began, there was a sudden mourning
 shuru main congress 11 siton par aage thi, jabaki shiromani akali dal-bhartiya janata party (esaidi-bhaajapa) gathbandhan do siton par
 Subsequent assessments quickly gave early signs of a landslide victory for the ruling SAD-BJP alliance
 pichley 40 varsh se punjab akali or congress sarkaron main raddobadal karata rahaa he
 Amarinder was confident of his victory to the extent that he had set it up for a post-vijay press conference in the afternoon
 lekin isaki bajaae ve pradesh congress ke adhyaksh pad se istife kii peshkash karne lage
 He had announced that this would be his last election
 unhone kaha tha, ‘main is baras 70 saal kaa ho jaaoongaa
 i do not think i will contest any other election
 ’ amarinder kii paraajay se avasarwaadi congressi abhi se 2017 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan 'chif ministar in vatting' banane ke liye lamabandi karne lage hai
 The defeat of Punjab has shaken the drunk Congress, born to rule
 congress ko ummid thi ki uttar pradesh main ghatiya pradarshan ke daag ko vah punjab or uttarakhand kii jeet se saaf kar legi
 Ludhiana's 'extremely desperate' MP and party spokesperson Manish Tiwari says that despite being in opposition, the state unit was burdened with the anti-incumbency trend aimed at the Congress-led government at the Center
 ve sweekaar karte hai, ‘puure shahari bharat main ek chidhaa hua congress virdohi mood he
 'in the private conversation most of the Congress leaders agree with him
 itani hi chintaa kii baat vah aavaran bhi he, jise congress netritv ne odh rakhaa he
 Sonia has said that these results will not affect the stability of UPA-2
 ho saktaa he, aankadon ke lihaaj se na pade, kyonki mulaayam singh yadav kah chuke hai ki ve bhaajapa ko baahar rakhane ke liye congress ko samarthan dena jari rakhenge
 But the recent electoral debacle will definitely affect the government's ability to run
 media ke saamne sonia gandhi ne nuksaan ko yah kehete hue kam karke dikhaaya ki ‘hamen punjab se zyada kii ummid thi
 Sonia thought it better to blame Manpreet Badal's People's Party of Punjab (PPP) than to tinker with her own
 unhone kaha, ‘pipipi ne 23 siton par hamen nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 'to an extent they are right
 ek bharosemand teesraa vikalp jutaney kii manpreet kii puri koshishon ke baavjood, ve sirf satta virdohi vot congress se pare le ja sake
 But like Uttar Pradesh, the Congress campaign in Punjab was flawed
 samaajawaadee party or akali dal ke vipareet congress khud ko samay ke saath badalane main naakaam rahi
 Pramod Kumar, director of the Institute for Development and Communication in Chandigarh, says the victory of the akali-bjp alliance has come with 'a considerable change in the traditional agenda of the Akali Dal'
 party ne oparation bluestar ke baad kii raajnneeti se apane sambandh puri tarah samaapt karte hue vibhedakaari panthik naaron se puri tarah tauba kar lee
 He chose populist slogans and development
 shiromani akali dal ne nae sire se soshal ejineering karte hue shahari hinduon ko apane saath joda
 Significantly, for the first time, 9 of the 12 Hindus who were nominated by the Akali Dal won the election
 iske vipareet amarinder or unke logon ne apane samarthakon se vaada kiya ki unke saath chale damanchakra kaa badla liya jayega or saath hi vaada kiya ki ‘akaliyon ko sabak sikhaaya jayega
 'but he was unable to tell people his vision of future Punjab
 congress kaa ghoshnaptr bhi upmukhyamantri sukhbir singh badal ke vikaas agenda kaa koi vishwasaneey or jamini vikalp pesh nahin kar sakaa
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's identity is also closely associated with Punjab
 upie ke khilaaf naaraazgi is had tak thi ki kuch hi congress pratyaashiyon ne pradhanmantri ko apane grih rajya main prachaar ke liye bulaane kii maang kii
 Sonia has accepted that inflation may be one reason for the defeat
 pawan bansal, ambika soni, ashvini kumaar jaise rajya se anya mantriyon or yahaan tak ki kapil sibbal kii punjabi pahchaan bhi votaron ko apane paksh main karne main naakaam rahi
 Losing elections, not fighting, Mayawati has been successful in maintaining her social base
 jin chunaav parinaamon ne mayawati ko ajeyata ke dhong se nikaalkar kadavi hakeekat ke dharaatal par laakar patake diya tha, uske agle hi din ve apni sangemarmar kii bejaan murtiyon ke ulat kahin zyada maanviya najar aa rahi thim
 When she arrived in Lucknow to face the media, there was no way of the nobles in her move
 or jab ve boleen, tab unke shabd ji-hujuriya reportron ke liye divya aadesh kii tarah nahin rah gaye the
 He answered the questions politely, but rather endured the questions
 mayawati jab tak avadh kii maharani thim tab tak unamem yah vinamrata nahin thi
 Mayawati accurately reviewed her downfall, not allowing sentimentality to dominate: 'dalits across the state have voted for the BSP
 isi vajah se basapa duusare number par he
 Had it not been so, my condition would have been similar to what Lalu Prasad did in Bihar
 ’ bilkul thik kaha
 She has lost Uttar Pradesh, but has retained her base more or less
 aankade unhen sahi sabit karte hai
 Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party got only 3 votes
 3 pratishat kaa antar he
 However Mayawati got 25 this time
 9 pratishat vot, 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main unhen mili voton se 4
 5 percent less
 or, 2007 main unhen bhi waisi hi ekatarfa jeet mili thi, jaisi 2012 main mulaayam singh ko mili he
 Furthermore, there has been no significant fluctuation in Mayawati's votes in the last two Lok Sabha elections and the recent assembly elections; It has been between 24 and 27 percent
 aisa saamaajik vot, jo nasht na hota ho or aasaani se transfar ho jaataa ho, raajnneeti main anoothaa he
 But the only Dalits cannot win Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh
 or mayawati ko yah baat 2007 main apni jeet kii oonchai se or uske paanch saal baad dhadaam hone kii apni raftaar se samaj leni chahie
 And in this case too, Mayawati herself is the biggest analyst of her party
 unhone kaha, ‘congress ko kamjor dekhakar or pichhadon or savarnon ko bhaajapa kii taraf jate dekhakar musalamaanon ne samaajawaadee party ko thok main vot diya
 70 percent of Muslims voted for the Samajwadi Party
 ’lekin jatiyon kaa ganit puri kahani nahin kahata
 This does not explain why Mayawati, who had been spending every day of her office in preparation for March 6 for the past five years, could not bring the rural poor in her favor
 yah vifaltaa vanchiton kii laalasaaon or unke shashaktikaran par bani party kii ekmaatr netaa kii simaaon ko hi ujagar karti he
 Uttar Pradesh's development index negates the rote rhetoric of the backward areas
 mayawati ke raaj main uttar pradesh ne 7
 8, which has registered a growth rate of 28 percent
 15 pratishat ke rashtriya ausat se thodaa hi kam he
 And also look at the growth rate of India in the earlier 10 years when 7
 4 pratishat thi, tab uttar pradesh kaa ausat 4
 Was at a dismal level of 4 percent
 vikaas kaa suchakank prasannataa ke suchakank se mail nahin kha rahaa tha or vot jutaney main prasannataa kaa suchakank kahin zyada sakasham hota he
 Mayawati herself cannot blame anyone other than her royal style
 lakhanu main 5 kalidas maarg kii kothi main ve zyada bheetar dhansati chali gayi or utana hi zyada un matadaataaon ke dil se dur hoti gayi, jin matadaataaon ne 2007 main unhen shikhar par pahunchaaya tha
 No leader on the wave of the spirit of social justice can ignore the people
 vishwaas na ho to je
 Try asking Jayalalithaa or Lalu Prasad
 mayawati ke patan main ummid kii ekmaatr kiran yah he ki daliton ne puri tarah unka saath choda nahin he or yah ki mayawati aaj bhi bharat kii sabase shaktishaalee netaaon main se ek hai
 He now has a full five years to prepare himself for the next battle
 satta se baahar rahakar bhi ve buniyadi hakeekat ko behatar dhang se samaj sakati hai

 The magazine has written that under his leadership in Gujarat the state has witnessed spectacular economic growth, but due to his role in 2002, he is being questioned
 haalanki patrika ne yah bhi likh diya he ki unhen adaalat ne sabhi aaropon se mukt kar diya
 He has written that in India, where leaders have come to know their use as a medium of dialogue more than foreigners, Modi is different from every point of view
 apane personal style ko apane raajnneetik plateform se jodne main modi sabase alag dikhte hai
 The magazine has written that the Modi kurta is not a set of value but a beauty
 isamen hi uskaa aakarshan he
 The New York Times has seen a leader in Narendra Modi who he wears

 a good experiment has been done in the government schools of Uttar Pradesh under the Midday Meal (lunch) Scheme, according to which schools will now have to build their own gardens so that vegetables and fruits can be grown in it
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay (MHRD) ne prayek sarkari skulon ko nirdesh jari karte hue kaha he ki kaksha aathvin tak milane vaale dopaher ke bhojan main bageeche main ugaai gai ek sabji yaa fal shaamil karnaa anirvaay hoga
 An education department official said, "when the children are asked to work hard to grow vegetables and later they will be served the same food, they will have a completely different taste for it, because they develop an attachment to that food in advance
 Would have done " yojana ke peeche sidhaa sa vichaar dopaher ke bhojan main poshak mulya ko badhaava dena or bacchon ko paudhon, subjiyon or falon ko ugane ke liye protsaahit karnaa he
 According to the Ministry of Human Resource Development, schools that do not have enough land can grow fruits and vegetables using teris gardens, pots, containers and bags
 bageeche kii dekharekh bacchon ko hi kerani hogi, jiske liye vah vidhyalay ke staff or shikshakon se madad le sakate hai
 Basic Education Minister Anupama Jaiswal in Uttar Pradesh said, “the Ministry of Human Resource Development will provide five thousand rupees per year to each school for this
 har vidhyalay ko kshetra main hone vaale fal subjiyon ko lekar apni yojana iske liye prastut kerani hogi

 Jadhav was heard a lot on social media for making such a claim and challenge

 parshad bane unhen ab teen maheene hone ko aa rahe hai, iske baavjood ve apane ilaake main koi kaam nahin karvaa paa rahe hai
 The reason for this is that zonal committees are not being formed in the corporations, due to which the councilors are neither able to get any work done in their areas nor the people are able to solve their problems
 khaali baithe hue hai apane ilaakon main parshad
 In fact, the problems faced by the councilors include litter piles in areas, lack of sanitation workers, trouble with street lights, dirty water in drains and felling of trees, etc
 in samasyaon kaa nivaaran bahut chota he, lekin samasya yah he ki teenon nigamon ke sabhi jone main jonal cametiyon kaa gathan nahin hua he, isliye na to vahaan ye samasyaayein uthaa paa rahi hai or na hi unka nivaaran ho paa rahaa he
 Actually the councilor is the chairman of the zonal committee and these committees are statutory, in which all the officers of the zone are members
 parshad inhi jonal cametiyon ke jariye apane ilaake main puraane kaam or nae kaam ko karavaate hai
 According to the councilors, the area officials say that until the zonal committee does not pass any order, it is unable to work, due to which new problems are coming before the councilors
 parshadon kaa kahana he jonal cametiyon ke gathan kaa notificationdilli sarkaarjari karti he, lekin abhi tak sarkaar ne notification jari nahi kiya he, jisaki vajah se cametiyon kaa gathan nahi ho paa rahaa he

 The tongue was much stronger than before and many arrows including land bills in quiver
 is baar rahul manch par chadhe to na narendra modi kaa naam lene se kataraae or na hi hamalaa karne se
 Describing the central government as anti-farmer and the poor scared of the government, Rahul prepared his land from the platform of the rally

 Returning from anonymity, Rahul said, 'modi government is a suit-booted government
 sarkaar udyogpatiyon ke liye kisaanon ko bhul gai he
 60 percent of the country's population is dependent on agriculture, but i want to ask the government, why is there anger on such a large population? Rahul Gandhi further said in his speech that the government of good days has failed and the farmers have been left trusting

 He directly blamed the central government for not raising the wheat of the farmer, but also said that compensation was not given to the farmers for the crops which were damaged due to the incessant rains and hail

 According to the provisions in the US Constitution, it is in America's interest if a president loses mental capacity after the election, slashes his government in any embezzlement or repression or hurts the confidence of foreign powers
 ab america samvidhan main raashtrapati ke impichament ke liye di gai sharton main lagbhag sabhi sharton par donald trump par aarope lagaaya ja saktaa he
 If any of these allegations are found true, the process of impeaching the new president in the US Parliament will begin
 jaaniye kin kaarnon se impich ho sakate hai donald trump1
 Donald Trump's business interests in the American Constitution and Government Ethics experts advised Donald Trump only in November after the election that he should sell his business across the world and invest in areas that would not affect his powers as president or he After selling the business, put the money received in a blind trust
 gauratlab he ki raashtrapati trump ke kaibijness interestiai or unhen duniya ke kai deshon se unki niyamit aamadani hoti he

 Flynn was accused of having tried to impose sanctions on Russia by President Barack Obama in December after Trump was elected in November
 is maamle main yah saaf hua ki rus ne america chunaav main dakhsandaji kii thi
 In addition, the role of Senator Devin Nunes and Senator Richard Barr, elected by Trump to the CIA and Senate Intelligence Committee, proved dubious, prompting Trump to seek the resignation of National Security Advisor

 Pushing the confidence of foreign forces, Donald Trump targeted the Muslim countries of the Gulf and Asian countries, including neighboring allies on the issue of immigration
 apane pehle maheene ke kaarykaal ke dauraan vah 7 muslim deshon ko vija die jane par pratibandh laga chuke hai

 vahiin vah asian deshon se iti or pharma kshetron main america main ech1bi vija par kaam kar rahe imigrents ko baahar nikaalane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 It is clear that these decisions are likely to harm the international interests of the US government and according to the constitution, this is also a reason enough to oust Donald Trump from the chair

 a few days ago a student from Najafgarh in Delhi wrote that there is no library in his village
 librari jane ke liye use dilli main hi 40 kilometre kaa safar karnaa padataa he
 Perhaps it was the first occasion or the first audience that wrote us a letter for the library
 pichley kuch dinon se uttarakhand ke pithauragarh se chaatro ke massej aa rahe the ki ve librari or kitabon ko lekar andolan kar rahe hai
 When have you heard that students are agitating to improve their college's junk library? zaahir he is par dhyaan janaa hi chahie
 Good thing the students struggled first
 kai dinon se sangharsh kiya taaki ve sthaneey str par apni yah ladaai jeet saken
 If their intention is limited to the reading room to prepare for the competitive examinations in the name of the library, then it is not a big deal but to stay lost in the world of books, they are asking for a better library, then this week's most brilliant public There is movement
 hamen har din sangharsh karte rahanaa chahie taaki maanavtaa ke prati prem ek sachai bana rah sake

 For twenty days Delhi is unaware that such a movement is also happening in India

 They even sit on a Sunday
 pithauragarh zila bharat china or nepal se lagi seemaa par he
 Laxman Singh Mahar Government Postgraduate College
 1963 main jab yah college bana tha tab agra uniwarsity kaa hissaa tha
 In the 70s there was a movement to demand the hill university in which two young men Sajjan Lal Shah and Soban Singh were killed by the Nepali police
 uske baad 1973 main kumaun or gadhwal ke liye alag-alag uniwarsity banati he
 Pithoragarh is part of Kumaon University

 The condition of the library in the city's colleges is bad, but the students understood whatsapp University as their fate
 pithauragarh ke in chaatro ne samaj liya he ki kitaaben milengi to unki zindagi banegi
 At least this is a matter that cannot be compromised
 7000 chaatr padhate hai is college main
 Students said that dozens of posts were vacant
 19 dinon ke samarthan main ek din inaki maaen bhi usee binar ko liye aa gayi jis par likhaa tha shikshak chahie
 Want a book 8 aktubar 2018 ko bhi yahaan ke ziladhikari ko gyaapan diya gaya tha taaki ve chaatro kii baat mantri tak pahunchaa den
 Memorandum has been submitted to the District Magistrate's Office 5 times
 chaatro ne nainital kaa bhi chakkar lagaaya
 When no response was received to any memorandum, the students themselves sat on the dharna
 pithauragarh kii sadak par chaatr chaatraon kii maaon ne bhi march kiya he
 Taking a poster banner of their children, they marched for their better future
 kaash ki aisa andolan har shahar main bada ho jaae
 Read the poster that this mother has in her hand
 kalege main na shikshak he na kitaaben hai, meraa baccha padhegaa kaise
 The movement which could not take place in Delhi, could not take place in Patna, could not take place in Kolkata, is happening in Pithoragarh
 pichley saal kolkata kii neshnal librari gaya tha
 Students appeared for the competition examination in the huge reading room but no student wandered in the books lying there
 sabaki mez par baahar se laai gayi compatishan kii kitaaben thim
 There is also Ashutosh Mukherjee Collection on his campus
 87,000 kitabon kaa unka sangrah tha
 There is a separate library on the campus of the National Library for this number of books
 arbian nits ke 30 sanskaran hai
 There is a dictionary of many languages
 1881 main cambridge main ganit par unka research paper chapa tha
 After studying law, Ashutosh Mukherjee also became the judge of Kolkata High Court

 Ashutosh Mukherjee was the father of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee
 bharat main aise kitne pathak honge jinke paas duniya bhar se laai gai or mangai gai 87,000 se adhik kitaaben thim
 In the country of such readers, youngsters of independent India are agitating for books in the library
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki librari main jo kitaaben hai ve sab pichhali sadi kii hai
 The laboratory of the college is in very poor condition
 isliye 17 june se chaatro ne dharna pradarshan shuru kar diya
 This movement is also asking the youth of the country to go to their library and see if new books have arrived
 diwaar par to digital librari likhaa he
 Has written so that whenever the Prime Minister passes, his digital India can be seen
 chaatro ne kaha ki naam kii hi digital librari likhaa hua he
 The reading room in the library of this college of 7000 students is for the seating of more than 30 students
 librari kii rack par ye kitaaben pichhali sadi kii ai hui hai
 The world has changed a lot since those books
 sillen bhari in kitabon main ab wo course bhi nahin miltaa he jo inhen padhaayaa jaataa he
 Be it history or science
 sab puraani ho chuki he
 Do not find the book here, get down from the mountain for the book and then climb
 unhen yaa to haldwani aana padataa he yaa dilli
 Or have to ask someone
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki science kii kitaaben hai wo 1987 kii chhapi hai
 History has changed but books have not changed
 pariksha ke sawaal in kitabon se bhi mail nahin khate hai
 The book of home science is not available
 librari main nahin milti he to phir chaatro ko haldwani yaa dilli jaakar kitaab leni padati he yaa mangani padati he
 It takes 8 to 10 hours to reach Pithoragarh to Haldwani
 1990 ke baad kasbon ke college jaanboojh kar khatm kiye gaye
 His building was brightened but he is not the master
 college kii librari khatm kar di gai
 It was not that the youth left the books first but rather the books were taken away from them under a system
 hamane jab uniwarsity series kii thi tab kahin koi aisi pratikriya nahin hui
 Students did not mind that their college did not have teachers, no books
 na bihar main na upi main na rajasthan main
 Students of Pithoragarh have taken the initiative, so now the state has started getting support from them
 jaisaa ki maine kaha ki is hafte kaa yah sabase khubasurat janandolan he
 Teachers book movement is its name
 dehradun main bhi mangalvaar ko shahid smarak par saamaajik kaaryakarta is andolan ke samarthan main baithenge
 The library situation in India is very poor
 india spend ne isi 30 june ko bharat kii librari par ek vistrut report chhaapi thi
 Accordingly, for the first time in the 2011 census, public library has also been counted
 tab pataa chalaa ki bharat ke gaanvon main 70 hazaar se adhik librari he or shaharon main 4580
 The total number of small large libraries for a population of one billion is not even 80,000
 america main public librari system aabaadi ke 95 fisadi hisse kii seva karata he
 Every year an American citizen spends $ 36, about 2500 rupees
 yahaan par ek naagarik par 7 paisa librari ke naam par kharch kiya jaataa he
 When we go to America, the people there take us to the locality or show the library of our city
 bahut shaan se bataate hai ki aap duniya kii koi bhi kitaab kaa request dijie librari manga kar degi
 Be it a Hindi book or Bangla
 yahaan to pithauragarh ke chaatro ko kitabon ke liye dharna dena pad rahaa he
 Even the students of Pithoragarh do not know that if the students of every town wake up after being inspired by them, then what a beautiful atmosphere of teaching will be created
 pithauragarh ke baad ham aapako le chalate hai pokaran
 How proudly does India take the name of this place

 There is speculation that Sidhu, who will join the Congress just before the elections, can be made deputy CM
 siddhu amritsar (east) se chunaav jitkar aae hai
 However, Amarinder Singh says that Rahul Gandhi will take the final decision in this regard
 agar siddhu ko up-mukhyamantri kii kursi milti he to rajya kii siyasat main ye pehla mauka hoga jab siem or dipti siem donon kii janmasthali patiala hogi

 The electoral riots in Uttar Pradesh, which hold their special importance in the country's biggest election battle, are expected to be interesting this time
 pradesh main chunavi dangal jeetne ke liye do bade rashtriya dal gujarati daanv-pench kaa sahaara lete najar aaenge to vahiin anya dal apni chunavi dhar ko painaa banane main jute hue hai
 Whereas the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress have started electoral turmoil to fight the Gujarati stalking punches in the political land of Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj to put themselves ahead in this election battle The party (BSP) is also trying hard
 sanyukt pragatishali gathbandhan (samprag)-van or samprag-tu ke baad congress samprag-thri sarkaar banaakar hetric banane main juty he
 Despite all the internal politics of the party, the BJP, which has put forward Narendra Modi, also knows that this time it will be a dream for him to return to power at the Center if he is not able to redeem all the shortcomings of the UPA government
 yahi vajah he ki piem in vatting rah chuke bhaajapa netaa laalkrishna adwani kii bhi parvaah nahin karte hue narendra modi ko turup ke ikke kii tarah pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 For Narendra Modi, it will also be a litmus test
 iske liye unke sabase khaas sipahasaalar amit shah ko party adhyaksh rajnath singh ne uttar pradesh kaa prabharee banaakar yahaan ke maahaul ko modimay banane kaa prayaas kiya he
 The Congress has appointed Madhusudan Mistry from Gujarat to take charge of Uttar Pradesh to break Shah's bets
 desh main sabase zyada 80 loksabhaa siten uttar pradesh main he
 The situation of both BJP and Congress in the state is turbulent
 varsh 2009 main upi main dhamaakedaar pradarshan karte hue congress ne bhaajapa ke sapane tod die the, lekin party yah bhi jaanati he ki is baar uski raah behad kathin he
 In terms of organization, the party is still in old condition
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh swayan isi rajya se hai
 Even after this, the party has failed to rejuvenate
 upi vidhansabha chunaav main bhi rajnath singh sahit anya varisht netaaon ne bade-bade daawey kiye the, lekin jab nattejey saamne aae to sabhi keval aatmvishleshan or haar kii vajah pataa lagane kii baat hi kahkar pallaa jhaadte rahe
 Now Rajnath has thought of doing something new by playing the Shah bet
 lekin gujarat kii tarj par uttar pradesh main narendra modi kaa jaadu barkaraar rakhana shah ke liye kisi chunauti se kam nahin hoga
 On the other hand, the challenges in the state are not less for Madhusudhan Mistry, who has won the trust of Congress
 do maheene pehle march main india today ne kashmir ke kuch durdaant patharbaajon ko apni karatuuton ko khud apane munh se bayaan karte dikhaaya tha
 One of them, Zakir Ahmed Butt, told how he had killed two people by throwing a petrol bomb on a car
 india today ne bat ko camere par ye kabool karte dikhaaya tha ki kis tarah uske paas handlers se paisa pahunchataa tha
 He had only one plan - to hold the valley hostage
 india today kii vishesh jaanch team (SIT) ne ab apni tahakikat main patharbaajon ke dhoort financers ko benakaab kiya he
 It has always been believed that the strands of disturbances spread during the summer in the Kashmir valley are connected to the sponsors across the border
 lekin pehali baar india today ko is sambandh main pukhta saboot jutaney main kamyaabi mili he
 These evidences show how Pakistan writes the script of anger shown in the valley
 saath hi ghati ke asli khalnaayakon kaa kaale chitthey kaa bhi khulaasa hota he
 Provincial president of Hurriyat's Geelani faction Naeem Khan was approached by under-cover reporters of the India Today Special Investigation Team and expressed his willingness to fund the separatists in Kashmir, describing himself as an imaginary Dhankuber
 naeem phir chori chupe dhang se under cover reporters se milane dilli tak pahunch gaya
 The revelations that Naeem made were shocking
 naeem khan camere par ye kehete hue kaid hua ki 'pakistan pichley 6 saal se kashmir main bada pradarshan khadaa karne ke liye haath-pair maar rahaa he
 On what level of money is being pushed to promote violence in the valley, Naeem Khan said, 'the money coming from Pakistan is more than hundreds of crores, but we expect more
 'ek ke baad ek baichaiyn karne vaale khulaason kii kadi main ye to sirf ek chota sa hi hissaa he
 The Hurriyat leader also made it clear how Islamabad is also washing black money
 on record kisi bhi kashmiri algaavvaadi netaa ne pehali baar ye khulaasa kiya he
 Naeem Khanne said, 'the fund comes every three or six months
 kabhi kabhi rakam saudi arab ke raste aati he
 Sometimes these installments come via Qatar
 ' india today ne jaanch main paaya ki kis tarah rashtriya rajdhani ke dil main, ballimaran or chandani chowk kii sankari galiyon main algaavvaadiyon se hamadardi rakhane vaale is hawala kaarobaar ko anjaam dete hai
 Naeem Khan said, 'all the money comes from Delhi
 ham se judaav rakhane vaale apana kamishan kaatane ke baad fund kii delivery karte hai
 'funds coming through Delhi have increased considerably as such delivery is considered safe from smuggling from across the border
 hurriyatki andar kii jaankaree rakhane vaale shaks ne skulon ko jalaane main bhi apane gut kii bhoomika kaa khulaasa kiya
 In Kashmir, 31 schools were set on fire in the four months of winter
 lagbhag 110 sarkari imaaraton ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaaya gaya
 Naeem Khan expressed his support for these attacks with great finesse
 naeem khan ne kaha, 'aapako avyavashtha ke liye afratfari kii jarurat hoti he
 It does not mean that whether it means burning of railway stations, police stations, schools, panchayat buildings
 allaah hamen mahfuj rakhe, aspataalon ko isse alag rakhaa janaa chahie
 For disturbances, we have to do certain things
 ' naeem khan ne ankhon main chamak ke saath kaha, 'unhen jalaayaa gaya kyonki ham vahaan maujuud the
 Nothing was possible without our support
 'algaavvaadiyon ne saaf taur par apana rodmap bana rakhaa he
 Keeping the Kashmir Valley boiled at the top of their agenda
 unke kapati mansoobey kii ek ek kar paraten india today andercover reporters ke saamne khulti gayi
 Ghazi Javed is the leader of Baba tehreek-e-hurriyat
 baba ne under cover reporters ko bataaya- 'isaki bharpai jab tak aarthik taur par hoti he
 Things will be bad
 kharaab bhul jaao, hadataalen jari rahengi
 Protest marches will be carried out
 kisi dukaan ko khulne kii ijaajat nahin di jaaegi, koi vaahan nahin chalane die jaaenge
 In this episode, Naeem Khan added - If Rs 300-400 crore more is poured, the disturbance can be drawn for three more months
 thakaan apana asar naa dikhaane lage iske liye hamen or jhande jalaane honge
 This revelation is evil
 pakistan kii ore se 400 karod rupye jitani badi rakam ghati main ek shahar se duusare shahar main aag failaane ke liye jhonki ja chuki he
 Also, their nefarious agenda includes burning of Indian flags
 ab sabase zyada hairaan karne vaali baat
 Syed Ali Shah Geelani's henchmen connected their chiefs directly to Pakistan

 motorola ne farvari ke mid main bharat main Moto Z2 Force launch kiya he
 It currently costs Rs 34,999
 Force yani takat, or yahi he isaki khaasiyat
 The company claimed with the launch that its screen does not break
 kya daavon par khara utarataa he ye smartphone? janenge is rivyuu main
 Can Motorola make this smartphone a game changer by giving an unbreakable screen? Probably not
 isliye hamane rivyuu main Moto Z2 Force ko har paimaane par jaancha parkhaa he
 Performance, camera, display and battery life are the main points about which you will get to know in detail in this review
 is rivyuu main aap padhenge-moto Z2 Force drop test ke bare
 Screen breaks or not? What's special in design and build quality? What's special in photography? Buying smartphone for photography, what's special for you? Where does this smartphone stand in terms of performance, how fast is it? How is the app response time and how is multi tasking? You will find answers to similar questions in this review
 dizin or bild qualitynoto Z2 Force ko hold karte hi sabase pehle jo aap notice karenge wo iskaa slee yani patala hona
 This smartphone is quite sleek and very easy to hold
 Moto z siries ke smartphone main mode lagane kaa opshan hota he isliye rier panel ek duusare se miltaa julata hi he
 There is a metal body smartphone and dual camera setup is given in the rear and the module is round and you will also notice the camera bump, but this is because you can install the mod here
 is smartphone ke liye motorola ne is baar 7000 siries aluminites yuj kiya he
 In the rear bottom, golden points will appear to connect the mods to which the mods are connected
 maujuuda sthiti kii baat karen to yah smartphone rier se kaaphi shandaar or premium lagata he, lekin front se ye thodaa purana lagata he
 This is because the trend is of Bezel Lace Display and its display is not Bezel Lace but is as traditional as the old smartphone
 iske peeche kii vajah company bataati he ki abhi tak wo technology nahin ai he jo shaterpruf disple ko bejal les bana de
 However, the front bottom of the phone has an oval shaped fingerprint scanner which is quite fast and accurate
 displexnoto Z2 Force main p OLED panel diya gaya he jiskaa rijolushan 2560X1440 he
 Since the display is also its specialty, for this, the company has used glass with shatter shield technology so that its screen does not break due to falling
 company ke daawey kii baat karen to motorola ne kaha he ki isaki disple na to kabhi tuutegi or na hi hi isamen koi crack aayega
 The display has 535 pixels per inch ie ppi
 colors shandaar hai, contrast bhi behatar he or dark blike bhi umdaa he
 So whether it is gaming or watching videos, our experience has been excellent
 indoor or outdoor main bhi disple par browjing karne yaa contant dekhne main koi problem nahin he
 You can easily see and read the display even in the sunlight
 kul mila kar isaki disple shandaar he or hamaara ise yuj karne kaa anubhav bhi acha rahaa he
 Drop Test - We found it to be true to the company's claims in the drop test
 farsh par hamane se 6 se 10 feet upar drop kiya he
 We did not see any cracks in it
 khaas baat ye he ki zyada scrtch bhi nahin laga
 The display is shatter proof, but at the same time its body is also strong due to 7000 series aluminum, and this series is known for this
 parformanceoto Z2 Force main 2017 kaa qolkom flagship procesar Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 diya gaya he or iske saath isamen Adreno 540 GPU he
 It has 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal memory and support for micro SD card, so you can put up to 2TB of memory card, which you probably will not get
 parformens ke maamle main yah smartphone fast he or task aaraam se parform karata he
 We have not felt any lag in day to day life and this phone works well even during gaming
 thodi der heavi gaming ke baad yaa garm hota he
 App loading time is also short and switching from one app to another is quite smooth
 motorola kii khaasiyat rahi he ki yah stock android jaisaa hi yujar interphes rakhata he yani isamen motorola ke kuch khaas eps ko chhodkar blottware nahin milte hai
 There is not much customization and you also get pure Android experience
 is smartphone se multi tasking bhi aap aaraam se kar sakate hai, haalanki iske liye koi zyada khaas fitures aapako nahin milte hai
 Internet browsing, running apps, calling calls, video calling or checking email
 in sab main aapako kai lag dekhne ko nahin milegaa
 Dual rear camera setup has been given in Moto Z2 Force for camera photography
 12 megapixl ke do camera sensor hai or aparchar f / 2
 Is 0
 phase ditection autofocus bhi diya gaya he
 Why have two cameras? The main camera sensor is RGB while the second lens shoots monochrome
 clic karne par boke effect miltaa he
 Black and white photos come better with monochrome and it combines with RGB sensor to produce good quality photos
 camera interphes kii baat karen to yah duusare motorola smartphone jaisaa hi he
 Photography is indoor or outdoor, it gives you good pictures by clicking
 video kii baat karen to yahaan aap 30 frem prati seconds kii dar se 4K video bhi record kar sakate hai
 The quality of photos and videos is excellent
 optical image stebligeshan kii kami khalati he or isaki vajah se camera slo he jo aap notice karte hai
 You can record full HD slow motion videos and you get 120fps
 acchhee raushnee ho to boke effect bhi acha dikhataa he yani becoground bler acchhee tareeke se hota he, thodi si raushnee kam hui to becoground bler aapako niraash karata he
 Outdoor photography is good and you will not be disappointed with the detailing of captured photos
 photo process hone ke baad aapako sateek color vaale photose milte hai or yah acchhee baat he
 Black and white mode is also good
 shater lag kabhi kabhi aapako pareshaan kar saktaa he hamen yah pareshaani hui he
 Overall, the issue is that the camera is fine, it clicks good pictures, but is not revolutionary and could have been improved
 bydareenoto Z2 Force main 2,730mah kii bydaree di gai he
 The company claimed to have a battery life of two days, which disappoints in real life testing
 regular yuj main bydaree ek din chalegi
 That is, you will listen to songs, check social media and watch videos, then you can use it regularly
 loop main video testing main bhi isaki bydaree acha byaap degi he
 Why buy this smartphone, there are two things that rarely will be found in a smartphone
 pehla ye ki aap agar aksar smartphone tod dete hai to nishchit taur par ye aapke liye he
 No matter how it falls, it will not break
 doosraa ye he ki isamen mode kaa saport diya gaya he
 If you want more battery backup, then install a battery mod
 camera juum behatar karnaa he to iske liye bhi mode he
 Mods can also be taken for attaching 360 degree cameras
 acchhee quality kaa audio chahie to iske liye bhi aap mode kharid sakate hai
 This feature makes this smartphone different from others
 agar aap motorola ke fain hai to aapke liye is smartphone main kaaphi kuch nayaa he or shandaar he
 Why not buy There is an average in photography, battery life is not much and in the trend of bezel less display, this handset looks old style from the front
