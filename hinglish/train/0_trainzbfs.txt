 The death of Ghazal Emperor Jagjit Singh last year left a very important corner of the music world
 saal bhar baad ab soni mujic chitra singh ke saath milakar jagajeet singh kii aath gajalon kaa ek nayaa elbum 'master and hij magic' relies karne ja rahi he
 These ghazals were sung by Jagjit in his live shows during the eighties, but were not released yet
 chunki inhen live sho kii recording se uthaaya gaya tha, isliye inhen thodaa-bahut sanvaarane or durust karne kii jarurat thi
 So, before presenting them as an album, Chitra has given a beautiful look to these ghazals by keeping the voice and melody in mind, keeping in mind the essential points
 senior editor es
 In an interview to Sahay Ranjith, Chitra expressed her opinion on a wide range of topics, from Jagjit's total dedication to music to today's singers
 aap bhi janiehjagajeet singh ke live sho se jin geeton ko aapane chunaa he, kya ve kuch khaas hai?kuch maheene pehle ahmedabad ke hamaare ek dost or prashansak ne mujhase kaha ki unke paas jagajeet singh ke live sho kii waisi gajalon kaa collection he jo ab tak relies nahin hui hai or phir ve geeton kaa collection mujhe saunp gaye the
 i heard
 unamem se koi bhi studio ricarding ke kaabil nahin tha
 i made them fit for the album
 yah elbum meri ore se jagajeet ko shradhanjali or unke lakhon prashansakon ko ek tohfa he
 Are you also with Jagjit Singh in these songs? No, i am not part of this album
 phir bhi aap mujhe jarur sun sakenge
 At the moment, i will not tell anything more about it
 aap is elbum ko sunakar khud mahasoos karen to behatar hoga
 These songs were compiled by all the great ghazalgo of the country like Wasim Barelvi, Farak Ruhvi and Nangalib and these songs give you a taste of different stages of Jagjit Singh's life
 jagajeet singh ko gujarey saal bhar ho gaya
 Have you ever thought that in the meantime, they are singing atop some place? Of course, it has been a very difficult time for me
 main unke saath nahin
 i have some responsibilities that bind me
 shaayad isi vajah se ji rahi hum
 What do you remember most about Jagjit Singh's personality? He was a perfectionist in terms of music
 ve khud ek-ek saaj ko parakhte, baithne vaali or microphone kii jagah kaa baariki se muyna karte
 Never used to rehearsal before a concert
 par shrotaaon kii nabj pakadaney main unhen maharath thi
 Do you listen to their songs / ghazals everyday? Their ghazals are settled in my veins
 beshak main unhen roj na sunuun lekin ve mere saath hai
 i still remember the day when i heard his voice for the first time
 tab main talat mahmud kii fain thi
 Therefore, i did not like Jagjit's voice
 par jab maine unhen sunanaa shuru kiya tab mujhe ehsaas hua ki unki aawaaj dilodimag par dhire-dhire tari hoti he
 Initially, my ears probably did not have the ability to hear and understand their music
 ghazal ne ek lanbaa rasta tay kiya he
 Do you think that what is being sung in the name of Ghazal today is more lyrical than pure Ghazal? There are many music lovers in India who have done phd in music, but they cannot even make a note
 kya aapako lagata he ki aaj ke yuva gayakon ke kaaran ghazal style par asar padaa he?ghazal gayaki kaa andaaj badal gaya he
 Jagjit has brought Ghazal to the point that today everyone in the world wants to sing Ghazal
 logon kaa maananaa he ki ghazal gayaki jagajeet ji ko itnaa bada rutaba de sakati he to ve bhi aisa kuch kamaal kar sakate hai
 Jagjit Singh told the world how to compose the song, how to make it sound and how to add meaning to the lyrics
 aaj in baarikiyon ko koun samajhataa he? jagajeet singh kii gayaki main riyaj, sanyam or junun kaa anoothaa sangam tha, jo aaj kii peedi main nahin he

 As soon as elections are near, political parties begin the exercise of connecting celebrities with them
 aisa celebritiz ke badi sankhya main prashansakon ko jehan main rakh kar kiya jaataa he
 The India Today Fact Check team found the claim to be misleading

 The reverse search revealed that Kohli is not wearing a saffron scarf around his neck in the original picture

 The original picture of Tendulkar is of April 24, 2015 when he along with his family went to the Siddhivinayak temple to celebrate his 42nd birthday

 Gambhir's manager Dinesh Chopra, while talking to 'aaj Tak', claimed the claim in the post to be false

 However, there have been reports in the past for some time, in which speculation is being made that Deol and Gambhir may join the BJP

 Congratulations to captain @ chetri_sunil11 & Sonam Chhetri! a post shared by Football Xperts (@footballxperts) on Nov 20, 2017 at 8:51 am pstto the love of my life, a friend, critic and my guide
 Thank you so much for 13 years of memories made and heres to many more to come!a post shared by chetri_sunil11 (@chetri_sunil11) on Jun 11, 2017 at 4:13am PDT Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Pakistan was probably postponed because the situation that the two countries were preparing was going to be huge
 pakistan ko apana aarthik bhavishya china ke haath saunpane se pehle, america se duuri banane kaa saahas jutanaa tha jabaki china ko duniya ke sabase jokhim bhare desh main dakhal kii ranneeti par mutmain hona tha
 Everything went according to plan and with the agreement between Jinping and Nawaz Sharif, the diplomatic situation in South Asia changed completely
 bharat is badlaav ko chaah kar bhi nahin roak sakaa
 The US did not take an interest in stopping, while the marginalized Russia did not mean much
 china-paak samjhaute se ab na keval ek nayaa pakistan bharat se mukaabil hoga balki dilli kii sarkaar ko desh kii seemaa se kuch sau kilometre dur pakistan adhikrut kashmir sahit kashgar se guadar tak chini companiyon kii dhamachaukadi ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 How much is 46 billion dollars? If this question is related to Pakistan, the answer is that this figure is equal to 20 percent of Pakistan's GDP
 yahi vah nivesh he jiske samjhaute par jinping or navaj sharif ne dastakhat kiye hai
 It is not difficult to understand that China has not only taken over Pakistan's submerged economy but almost the entire Pakistan will be under the influence of China under the project in which this investment is taking place
 duniya ke sabase bade hydropavar project kii nirmaataa or 60 arab dollar kii sampattiyaan sanbhaalane vaali china kii thri gorges korporation kii aguai main jab china kii vishaal sarkari companiyaan pakistan ke itihaas kii badi aarthik va nirmaan pariyojna shuru karengi to unka shor dilli tak dastak degaa
 The china-pakistan Economic Corridor is the first project of its kind in which two countries are sharing their economic sovereignty
 karakoram rajmarg par sthit uttar-pashchimi chini shahar kashgar ko pakistan ke dakshini bandargah guadar se jodne vaale 3,000 kilometre ke is galiyare main sadakon, railway, tel-gas pipeline, audyogic park kaa network banegaa, jisamen pakistan adhikrut kashmir bhi shaamil he
 Gwadar will be converted into a free trade zone on the lines of Hong Kong
 lahore, multan, gujranvala, faisalabad, rawalpindi or karachi main metro bhi coridor kaa hissaa hai
 China has landed five of its top state-owned companies, Three Gorges, China Power International, Huaneng Group, ICBC Corp, Zonergy Corp in Pakistan
 inke peeche industrial and commercial bank of china ke sansadhano kii takat hogi
 iran-pakistan gas pipeline has also got Chinese patronage
 iskaa 560 mile lanbaa irani hissaa (faras kii khadi main asaluya se baluchistan seemaa tak) taiyaar he, ab pakistan ko guadar tak 485 mile pipeline bichhaani he
 China will bear 85 percent of the cost of this two billion dollar project
 yah pipeline pakistan ko 4,500 megawatt kii bijli kshamta degi jo puure mulk kii bijli kami ko khatm kar degi
 The decision to hand over the country's economic and strategic future to China was certainly a big one, but Sharif would not have found it difficult because the US did not give such a big deal to Pakistan's economy in the 60-year relationship that China gave at one go
 sharif ne china se pakistan kii kismat jodakar bahut kuch saadh liya he
 The Pakistani economy has almost sunk
 nivesh nadaarad he or videshi madad bhi khatm ho gai he
 China is famous for fast execution of projects
 puraa coridor agle 15 saal main taiyaar hona he jabaki china-iran pipeline to 2017 se kaam karne lagegi
 If everything goes well, fast construction will start in Pakistan in the next few months which will speed up the economy and reduce Sharif's political troubles
 china se dosti, sharif ko sena kaa dabadabaa ghataane or aatankwaadi gatividhiyaan simit karne main bhi madad kar sakati he
 China's yuan may change the face of Pakistan in the next five years
 aatank kii factory, asthir sarkaron or sena ke paroksh raaj vaale ek jokhim bhare desh main itnaa bada nivesh karne kii hikvamat keval china hi kar saktaa tha or visheshgyon kii maane to jinping aisa karne ke liye utsuk bhi the
 The mineral-rich regions of Afghanistan, Iran and West Asia are the new targets of China's economic ambitions and where the US and Russia are losing interest
 pakistan main yah nivesh dakshin asia main bharat kii ranneeti ko simit karegaa or china ko afghanistan se lekar pashchim asia tak mukt udaan kii suvidha degaa
 In addition, Pakistan will become a center of cheap production for China and will also prepare a way to bring Iran's gas and oil to China
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kootnithik sankalp saraahneey hai lekin unki global udaanon ke nattejey saamne aane se pehle hi china va pakistan ne bhartiya upmahadweep ke kootnithik sameekaran badal die hai
 There is not much option left for India to set conditions in South Asia's diplomacy
 myanmar, nepal, srilanka, maldive or bangladesh ke aarthik hiton ko sanjone ke baad china ne pakistan ko bhi hatheli par uthaa liya he
 Modi has to decide how India will reconcile with this new Chinese dream before moving to Beijing next month
 kootneeti kii duniya main shi jinping kii muhaavareydaar bhashaa nai nahin he phir bhi is baar jab unhone pakistan ko bhavishya kaa asian tiger (pakistan ke daily tikvas main chapa unka lekh) kaha to chaunkane vaale kam nahin the kyonki duniya kii kisi bhi mahashakti ne pakistan main yah sambhaavna kabhi nahin dekhi
 Whether or not Pakistan will become a lion in China's friendship is difficult to say, but one has to agree that Pakistan's grit and move with Chinese DNA will definitely change

 bijepi par chunavi rang chadh chukaa he
 But moving fast towards Delhi, Modi has also got a slight break
 aise main modi kii prachaar samiti par sahmati to bani nahin lekin ye saaf ho gaya ki ab kareeb ek darjan samitiyaan banengi jo chunaav prachaar se jude saare pahaluon ko denkhengi
 There was a meeting of the parliamentary board, but it became clear that Modi will have to take everyone along
 kareeb ek darjan samitiyon kaa elaan hoga jisaki aupchaarik ghoshnaa shuukravaar ko hogi
 The seating area has changed in this parliamentary board, but it cannot be denied that the era has changed
 adwani kii koi sun nahin rahaa or dilli kii chaukadi majaboor he modi ke saamne natmastak hone main
 But the truth is also that the Sangh had made it clear to Modi that everyone has to go with him so that the fight should be BJP vs Congress and not Modi vs Congress
 jaahir he isi maathapai ke bich sansadeey board kii baithak main do ghante maathapai ke baad ye tay hua ki prachaar samiti ke tahat
 
 
 - Create about a dozen subcommittees in which Election Manifesto, Publicity and Election Operations JC committees are formed
 - party ke mahasachivon or varisht netaaon ko jimmevary di jaaegi
 - BJP feels that Congress should chant or ignore Modi, only Modi will benefit
 - adwani, sushamaa, rajnath kisi samiti ke sadsy nahin honge
 The meeting lasted for about two hours
 ab kor group samaapt kar diya gaya he to sansadeey board hi kor group kaa kaam karne laga he
 Therefore, meetings will also be held continuously now
 baithak main chunavi agenda ke saath-saath sansad satr ke agenda par bhi maathapai hui
 It was agreed in Parliament to target the government on the corruption of Uttarakhand, along with the decaying economy
 bataaya jaataa he ki guuruuvaar ko in samitiyon ke prabhariyon kii ghoshnaa isliye nahin kii gai kyonki modi or rajnath singh use antim rup dene se pehle sambandhit vyaktiyon ke alaava rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se bhi vichaar vimarsh karnaa chaahate hai
 The last meeting of the board had given Modi and Rajnath Singh the authority to set up these committees keeping in mind the views of senior leaders
 bataaya jaataa he ki purv adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne dilli kii chunaav abhiyaan sambandhi samiti kaa prabhaar sanbhaalane se inkaar kar diya he
 Perhaps he has denied it because of the bjp's poor performance in the Delhi elections
 iske alaava purv party adhyaksh hone ke naate vah ise apane liye choti bhoomika maan rahe hai
 According to reports, he is keen to be in charge of the Rajasthan assembly elections
 board kii baithak main 5 agast se shuru ho rahe sansad ke monsoon satr ke dauraan party dwaara uthaae jane vaale vishyon par bhi charchaa hui
 On the bills introduced by the government, the strategy adopted by the BJP was discussed
 party ke sutron ne kaha ki khaadya suraksha vidheyak kaa bijepi samarthan karegi lekin kuch sanshadhano par jor degi
 The board, however, decided to oppose the government's recent decision to reduce FDI in the insurance sector from 26 to 49 percent
 monsoon satr main party uttarakhand main barish se tabaahi main sarkaar ke bachaav or raahat kaaryo main barti gai kathith dhilaai, desh kii suraksha sthiti, ibi or sibiai ke bich matbhed or bhrashtachar aadi ke muddon ko bhi uthaaegi

 For Kings XI, who were out of the playoff race, the victory was just a save, while the 13-point-old Royal Challengers, still ranked fifth, got a bit difficult for the playoffs
 lakshya kaa peechha karne utre royal chalangers ko kris gail (17) or viraat kohli (19) ne shuru ke do overon main to sirf 16 ran jod sake
 Kohli started the attack on the ball of Anurit Singh, who came with the third over, when the last ball of the over went into the wicket with the inner edge of his bat
 kohli ne nau gendon kaa saamana kar do chauke or ek chakka lagaaya
 Rishi Dhawan, who brought the next over, took just six runs, while Sandeep Sharma, who brought the fifth over, drove Gayle to the fourth ball

 Gayle faced 14 balls with a four and a six
 gail ke jane ke baad ballebaaji karne utre mandeep singh (20) ne aate hi chauke ke saath pari kaa aagaaj kiya or lagaataar chor badalte rahe
 Mandeep could only manage a 23-run partnership with Abraham de Villiers (10) for the third wicket after De Villiers was caught at the hands of Buren Hendricks in the midst of playing his familiar high shot at the leg stump

 This is an experience, we will face the situation

 balmuchu ne marandi par karaara hamalaa bolte hue aarope lagaaya ki marandi sochate hai ki jharkhand kaa vikaas sirf vahi kar sakate hai or rajya main tab tak chunaav hote rahanaa chahie jab tak ki marandi yahaan ke mukhyamantri nahin ban jaaen
 Balmuchu said that the Congress does not need Babulal Marandi at all, if Babulal really wants to see his status, then he should contest it on his own
 chhattisgarh kii siyasat main sabase chaunkaane vaali mulaakaat varsh 2018 ke aakhri din 31 disambar ko darj hui he
 Former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi and all the leaders of his party met Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel in Bilaspur
 agenda tha, nae jile ke nirmaan kaa
 For this, Ajit Jogi also submitted a memorandum to Bhupesh Baghel
 is mulaakaat kii tasviir ko jisane bhi dekha usne is mulaakaat ke myne nikaalane shuru kar die
 The news behind the news is coming from the political corridors, saying that Ajit Jogi and Bhupesh Baghel have met to find a middle ground for some mysterious matter
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle tak chhattisgarh kii raajnneeti ke do bade centre rahe bhupesh baghel or ajit jogi kii raajnneetik dushmani jag jaahir he
 Discussion of the two met between the politicians throughout the day
 darasal mukhyamantri banane ke baad bhupesh baghel pradesh kii raajnneeti kaa sabasebada cheharaa ban gaye hai
 Not only did Jogi and Bhupesh make fierce headlines for the last two years, the Jogi camp made a lot of use of material, price, punishment, distinction to make Bhupesh all around
 chunaav ke baad paristhitiyaan aisi badalin ki ajit jogi or unke netaaon ko bhupesh baghel kii raah takanee padi
 After a long wait in Bilaspur, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel met the Jogi camp
 yah mulaakaat bilaspur ke chhattisgarh bhawan main hui
 During this meeting, Ajit Jogi thanked Bhupesh Baghel for forming the government, while he also demanded to make Pendra a district
 is dauraan ajit jogi kii patni or kota vidhayak renu jogi, lormi vidhayak dharmajit singh or amit jogi bhi maujuud rahe
 In this meeting of about 5 minutes, Ajit Jogi told Bhupesh Baghel about the creation of a new district that he has been struggling for this for the last 15 years
 is mulaakaat ke baad jogi ne to mediakarmiyon se charchaa kii lekin bhupesh baghel ne patrakaron se dooriyaan banaae rakhin
 The Jogi camp has termed the meeting as common courtesy while political analysts are saying that the Jogi family had to wait for an hour at Chhattisgarh Bhavan to meet Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel
 jogi aamtaur par kisi kaa intjaar itnaa nahin karte
 This behavior heats up the political corridor
 rajanetaaon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki do teen din baad vidhansabha kaa sheetakaaleen satr shuru hona he
 If Jogi had wished, he could have met well inside the Vidhan Sabha, but his sudden visit to Bilaspur and meeting Bhupesh Baghel is seen adding some other incident
 baharhaal is mulaakaat ke kai kai myne nikaale ja rahe hai
 Time will tell what is the reality, but the meeting between Ajit Jogi and Bhupesh Baghel will melt the snow in the relationship between the two leaders
 ensiji main bharat kii sadsyta rokane ke liye china har tikram apnaane par tul gaya he
 The neighboring country has started batting for Pakistan in an unexpected move
 china kii sarkari media ne pakistan ke parmaanu record kaa bachaav karte hue kaha he ki parmaanu prasar ke liye jimmedaar akyuu khan ko sarkaar kaa samarthan nahin tha
 In such a situation, whatever exemption is given to India for admission to NSG, it should also be given to PAK
 sarkari 'global times' main chape ek lekh main kaha gaya, 'bharat jahanparmanu aapurtikarta samooh (enesji)main shaamil hone kii koshish kar rahaa he, vahiin vah pakistan ko uske kharaab parmaanu prasar record ke aadhaar par roktaa he
 Actually, the nuclear proliferation done by Pakistan was done by Pakistan's leading nuclear scientist Abdul Qadir Khan and it was not the official policy of the Pakistani government
 ''khan ko dandit kar chuki he sarkaar'lekh main aage kaha gaya he, 'khan ko kai saal tak ghar main najarband rakhe jane ke baad sarkaar ne unhen dandit kiya tha
 If the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the NSG can exempt India, then this exemption should also apply to Pakistan
 ' yah sambhavat: pehali baar he, jab chini aadhikarik media ne enesji main pakistan ko shaamil kiye jane kaa samarthan sidhe taur par kiya he
 China has been officially saying that there should be consensus about the inclusion of a country
 'yah nai badi samasya paidaa karne jaisaa''bharat ke enesji main shaamil hone main china nahin he baadha' heading vaale lekh main kaha gaya, 'china or anya desh pakistan ko baahar rakhte hue bharat ko enesji main shaamil karne ke khilaaf hai, kyonki iskaa arth bharat kii samasya ko suljhaana lekin ek anya badi samasya paidaa kar dena he
 If India joins Pakistan to gain membership of NSG, it seems far more practical than securing membership alone
 'nahin suljhaayaa gaya parmaanu vaidhata kaa muddalekh main kaha gaya he ki bharat or pakistan ne 1998 main parmaanu pareekshan kiye the or antarrashtriya samudaay ne inaki ninda kii thi
 The United States, the European Union and Japan imposed stringent restrictions on both countries
 11 sitambar ke hamalon ke baad in pratibandhon ko dhire-dhire hataa diya gaya tha
 The US had also signed a civil nuclear agreement with India and now the US supports India's claim to join the NSG
 lekin bharat ke 'parmaanu darje' kii vaidhata kaa mudda suljhaayaa nahin gaya he
 It was forcibly accepted
 The document further stated, "if India and Pakistan are allowed to join the NPT and adopt the CTBT, it will reduce the rights of both
" uttar korea, iran or isroyal jaise anya deshon main parmaanu hathiyaaron ke vikaas se kaise nipta ja sakegaa?' is lekh main pakistan kii ore se parmaanu prasar kaa aarope parmaanu vaigyanik khan par daalaa gaya
 Khan suffered a huge embarrassment in the year 2004
 unhen parmaanu praudyogiki ke prasar kii jimmedaari jabaran sweekaar kerani padi thi or aadhikarik taur par najarbandi main rahanaa padaa tha
 In 2009, the High Court of Islamabad declared Khan an independent citizen of Pakistan and allowed him to roam freely in the country
 sol main baithkon kaa daur shuruuyah lekh ek aise samay par aayaa he, jab enesji ne sol main apni baithak shuru kar di he
 However, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has said that India's inclusion in this group is not included in the agenda
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj kii ore se china ko manaa lene kaa vishwaas jataae jane ke 24 ghante se bhi kam samay main china ke videsh mantralay ne somvaar ko kaha tha ki enesji enpiti par hastakshar na karne vaale bharat jaise deshon ko sadsy banane ke mudde par abhi bhi banta hua he
 Government confident - will convince China In the past, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj had said, 'we will convince China to support our entry into the NSG
 ' chini videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa hova chunaying ne kaha tha, 'ham samaj sakate hai ki enpiti par hastakshar na karne vaale desh enesji main apane pravesh ko lekar chintit hai
 But the NSG is still divided on this issue, so it will not be ripe to talk about the issue of admission to the annual conference in Seoul
 'shuukravaar ko aakhri samrug baithklekh main kaha gaya, 'enesji kii samgr baithak somvaar ko shuru hui or yah baithak shuukravaar ko sampann hogi
 In an effort to become an NSG member, the Indian government has adopted an aggressive posture at the diplomatic level
 bhartiya raashtrapati pranab mukherjee or pradhanmantri narendra modi ne enesji sadsy deshon kaa samarthan hasil karne ke liye videsh yatraaen kin
 'the four manuals to join said,' The NSG was established by a group of countries that have the capabilities to export civil nuclear technology, equipment and materials
 iskaa uddeshy asainya parmaanu praudyogiki or saamagree kaa istemaal parmaanu hathiyaaron ke vikaas main karne se rokane ke liye parmaanu aprasar kaa lakshya hasil karnaa he
 'it said that to become a member of the NSG, the country should have four qualifications
 uske paas asainya parmaanu praudyogikiyon ke niryaat kii kshamta honi chahie, vah enesji kedishanirdeshonka paalan karata ho, usne parmaanu hathiyaaron ke aprasar se judi sandhi (enpiti) yaa anya kshetreey aprasar sandhiyon par hastakshar kiye hon

 Congress leader Jagdish Tytler may have difficulties in 1984 Sikh riot case
 sibiai jagadish titalar or abhishek verma kaa laai dedector test karana chaahati he
 The cbi's application in Cuddalore Court is scheduled to be heard in the court on February 10
 sibiai ko 1984 ke pul bangash danga maamle main court main states report deni he, or is baar sibiai koi kor kasar nahi chhodana chaahati
 The country's largest investigative agency CBI has to submit a status report in the 1984 riot case in Karkardooma Court, Delhi
 1984 danga main pul bangash ilaake main teen sikhon kii maut ho gayi thi
 Congress leader Jagdish Tytler was accused of leading the mob
 sibiai is maamle main lambey arase se jaach kar rahi he, lekin jagadish titalar ke khilaaf abhi tak sibiai ko koi thos saboot nahi mili hai
 In fact, Abhishek Verma had accused Jagdish Tytler that Tytler influenced key witnesses related to the case with his influence
 abhishek verma ke is bayaan kaa bhisibiaike paas koi jawaab nahi he, lihaaja ab sibiai ne court se jagadish titalar or abhishek verma kaa laai detector test karaane kii ijaajat maangi he
 Abhishek Verma is a big arms dealer and has consumed jail air several times
 is maamle main abhishek verma ko gavaah banaaya gaya he
 The matter is scheduled for hearing on Friday
 court ne jagadish titalar aushabhishek vermako samman kiya he
 This case has been in court for years
 kai baar sibiai ko court fatkaar laga chuki he
 This time the CBI does not want to leave any core before giving a status report to the court

 Other women on the list include actress Angelina Jolie, former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Michelle Obama, wife of the US President, and writer JK Rowling
 aisa katai nahin he ki sani ke chaahanewaalon main ab surveen kaa naam bhi shaamil ho gaya he
 Actually 'hate Story 2' actress Surveen Chawla is nervous about Sunny Leone who is about to do an item number named 'pink Lips' in this film of Surveen
 sutron kii maane to surveen ne apni adaaon ke saath naa sirf is film main jabardast sex kaa tadka lagaaya he balki apane bikini luk se lakhon darshakon ko madahosh bhi kar diya he, lekin jab se surveen ne film main sani leone ke item number kii khabar suni he tab se ve thodi sakate main hai
 He is afraid that on the basis of his sex appeal, Sunny should not take all the limelight with her position in the film
 yahi vajah he ki canada main ho rahi apni punjabi filmon kii shooting chhod surveen apni film kii pramotion ke liye mumbai pahunch chuki hai
 Not only this, in this first film, all the promotions are trying their best to attract the attention of the audience
 ab aise main kya hoga abhi iskaa faisla kar paanaa thodaa mushkil he, lekin haa surveen ko sani ke ‘pink lips’ se zyada ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he, kyonki surveen ne apni maadak adaaon se pehle hi apane darshakon ko jataa diya he ki ‘aaj phir tumpe pyaar aayaa he’

 Recently, there was a lot of controversy over the bodies of seven soldiers killed in Air Force Mig 17 helicopter crash in Arunachal Pradesh being packed in cardboard and plastic
 aap ye jaankaar hairaan ho jaaenge ki pichley 18 saal se bhi zyaada ho gaye hai lekin shahid javaanon ke shavon ko le jane ke liye abhi tak naa to taabut mili or naa hi bag pack
 In fact, for the first time since Operation Vijay in 1999, the official demand for coffins and bagpacks was raised
 iske baad 2 agast 1999 main raksha mantralay ne pehali baar iskaa contract sin kiya jisamen kareeb 900 bagpack or 150 taabut kii jarurat thi
 Coffins weighing 18 kg were demanded at that time but when it was supplied, it weighed 55 kg
 jiske baad isaki sibiai jaanch shuru ho gayi
 The then defense minister, George Fernandez, also had to resign
 iske baad is saude ko roak diya gaya or 2001 main is contract ko radd kar diya gaya
 In 2013, the CBI gave a clean chit in this case but till now the army could not carry a single coffin or bagpack in that deal
 is maamle main ek auditor ne apil fil kar di ki ye pataa lagaaya jaae ki jab bharat ko ye taabut die gaye to america ko us samay ye kis qeemat par die gaye the?march 2017 main court ne aadesh diya tha kii army in sabhi tabuton or bagpack ko le ja sakati he lekin auditor kii nayi apil ke baad is maamle main ek baar phir roak lag gai
 In 1984 Sikh riot case, Congress leader Jagdish Tytler has again started legal legalization
 dilli kii ek nichali adaalat ne sibiai kii closer report ko khaarij kar diya he
 The Karkardooma court has ordered a fresh probe into the role of Tytler in the Pulbangash riot case
 aaj bhi salata he 1984 kaa vah salcourt ne sibiai ko fatkaar lagaate hue closer report ko khaarij kar diya
 In the closure report, the CBI had claimed that there was not enough evidence of Tytler's presence in the riots in Pulbangash
 isliye un par cese nahin banataa he
 The CBI also surrounded the issue of witnesses in the court
 sibiai par aarope he ki un logon ko gavaah banaaya gaya, jinhen is khaufnak haadase ke bare main pataa bhi nahin tha
 Jagdish Tytler is accused of inciting a mob to kill 3 Sikhs in Pulbangash area
 titalar ne ye daawa kiya tha ki dange ke samay wo pradhanmantri ke awaas par the
 The US does not believe the 1984 riots were the first time the CBI had filed a closure report in this case giving a clean chit to Tytler in September 2007, but the court refused to accept it in December 2007
 iske baad march 2009 main ek baar phir sibiai ne titalar ko clin chit dete hue closer report daayar kii jise court ne manjuur bhi kar liya tha
 Police shut eyes during 1984 riots: CBI riot victims opposed it and challenged it in court
 ab court ke faisle ke baad sibiai ko ek baar phir dangon main titalar kii bhoomika kii jaanch shuru kerani padegi
 The decision is also considered a major setback for the Sheela government as assembly elections are due later this year

 Lalu was referring to the Jallianwala Bagh incident of 1919 in which British officer General Dyer opened fire on the unarmed
 madhubani main duusare din bhi hinsa, baari updravaunhone nitish kumaar kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha ‘ravan ke ahankaar bhi chur-chur hue the, janata ke saamne natmastak hokar or gidgidakar vot maange the ki ek chance or de dijie hamako
 Lalu said that 'lalu had misled everyone by showing fear of phobia and Lalu and the public kept waiting for seven years'
 unhone kaha ki ‘akhbaar main vigyaapan dekar yah galat sandesh failvaaya ki bihar badal gaya he’
 Lalu Yadav is making baseless accusations: Nitish Kumar Rajad sued accusers of corruption, atrocities and incest in Bihar and state Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for not meeting people and cheating with them and said that the result of Chief Minister's visit to Adhikar Including now days, public anger is continuously coming out
 nitish kumaar kii ore ishaara karte hue lalu ne bihar ke madhubani jile main nitish ko apaar jansamarthan mila tha or aaj vahiin ke logon ko goli marava rahe hai
 Nitish Kumar is the parrot of BJP and Sangh: Lalu once again announced Lalu Vihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's judicial inquiry into the Madhubani incident and accused him of cheating the people of the state and said that the justification of its investigation survives but With the punishment given to the shooters, they should have accepted that the shot was fired because of us
 lalu ne nitish se jaananaa chaha ki gat varsh ke farbishganj police golicond jisamen chaar alpsankhyakon kii jaan gayi thi or varsh 2008 ke kosi traasadee ke gathit nyaayik jaanch ayog kaa kya hua or unki jaanch report abtak kyon nahin aayi
 Nitish Kumar has become the second Nirmal Baba: Lalu, he said that whenever the public's anger increases after an incident, then by announcing a judicial inquiry into the matter, the trick of his daub is now understood by the people of the state
 lalu ne kaha ki is ghatana ko lekar aagaamee 15 aktubar ko vamadalon ke bihar band kaa rajd samarthan karti he or madhubani ghatana kii jaanch ke liye bihar vidhansabha main pratipaksh ke netaa abdul baari siddiki or purv kendriya mantri raghunatha jha ke netritv main rajd kaa ek shishtmandal kal vahaan jayega
 Nitish said, "habitually lying", Lalurajad supersons accused of taking away the democratic right of the people to take action against the protesters during Nitish Kumar's right to grant special status to Bihar
 lalu ne bihar kii nitish sarkaar ke jane kaa daawa karte hue kaha ki sajan re jhooth mat bolo khuda ke paas janaa he, na hathi he na ghoda he, vahaan paidal hi janaa he
 On the day of the performance i

 You have to find the answer to this question, only the urban society of India
 (kuch naam badal die gaye hai
 Whereas the former Chief Minister of UP used to fear in the name of coming to Noida during his tenure so that the chair does not go away due to bad omen, while the current Chief Minister of UP Yogi Adityanath has visited Noida thrice in a span of 15 days
 beete shuukravaar ko yogi greater noida main yuva mahotsav main pahunche
 Akhilesh Yadav, who was the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh before Yogi, did not come to Noida even once during his tenure
 mana yahi jaataa tha ki upi main mukhyamantri kii kursi par jo bhi hota he, agar wo noida jaataa he to apshagun ke chalate use apni kursi ganvaani padati he
 For this, examples of some chief ministers going to the chair were also given, but a minister of Yogi government has given some other reason behind Akhilesh Yadav not coming to Noida as chief minister
 upi ke udyog mantri satish mahana kaa kahana he ki akhilesh kisi andhvishwaas kii vajah se nahin balki noida aane se isliye darate the ki kahin flats niveshkon ke gusse kaa saamana nahin karnaa pade
 Let us know that there are thousands of investors in Noida who have been waiting to get their flats for many years despite giving full money to the builders
 yogi sarkaar lakhanu main 21-22 farvari ko nivesh sammelan kii taiyaari main juty he
 It is to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 udyog mantri mahana isi silsile main dilli main deraa daale hue hai
 Mahana said in a conversation with Aaj Tak that earlier people were afraid to come to Noida
 isliye nahin kyonki phir jeet kar aaenge yaa nahin, balki isliye ki kahin logon ke saamne naa aa jaaen
 Our Chief Minister comes here and is trying to find a solution by listening to the problems of the people
 mahana ne kaha ki flats niveshkon se judi ye samasya pichhali sarkaron dwaara khadi kii hui he jinhone ise sulajhane kii koi koshish nahin kii
 The buyers had booked their flats from 2006 to 2008 and the builders had asked them to give possession of the flats in 5-6 years
 2006 main book kiya flats 2012 main milanaa chahie tha, lekin 2017 main bhi nahin mila
 This problem has been created by them
 udyog mantri ne daawa kiya ki adhure pade flats kii samasya se nipatane ke liye banaae gaye mantri samooh ke kaam sanbhaalane ke baad ab tak 32 hajaar flats ke kampalishan certificate die ja chuke hai
 According to Mahana, earlier a builder had to go round to get a certificate from the Noida Authority after completing the project, now it is upside down, our officials call the builder and ask him to get the completion certificate if the project is complete
 mahana ne pichhali sarkaron par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki sabko pataa he plot dene ke liye kisne kitne paise liye
 According to Mahana, the sympathy of this government is with those whose hard earned money has been taken away by the builders
 sarkaar or mukhyamantri is koshish main hai ki kisi tarah aise bilders par kanoonee tareeke se dabaav banaakar logon ko unke flats dilwaaye jaaen
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has met investors twice
 niveshkon ko thagne vaale bilders ko jail bhejne kii maang par unhone kaha ki kuch aise bilders hai jo jail main bhi hai, unke niveshak jab samasya lekar aate hai to sawaal khadaa hota he ki ham baat kisase karen
 According to Mahana, the first attempt of the government is to somehow build people's flats with builders, if not, they will go to jail
 mahana ne kaha ki sarkaar bilders kaa survey karvaa rahi he, isse vastusthiti kaa pataa chalegaa ki kitna kaam hua he, project puraa karne par kitna kharchaa aayega
 We are also finding out how much money the builders have invested in the investors so that there is also an option to take action to seize the property of the defaulter builder
 galat niyat vaale kisi builder ko choda nahin jayega
 Uddhav Thackeray's resignation as editor of Saamna is published in the marathi-hindi language of the Saamana
 Uddhav Thackeray has resigned from the post of editor of Saamana before taking oath as Chief Minister of Samanam Maharashtra

 After that Uddhav Thackeray also took command of the confrontation with Shiv Sena
 uddhav ke istife ke baad ab unka naam saamana ke credit line main nahin jayega
 New sunrise in Maharashtra: In the last editorial of Saamna Uddhav Thackeray, Saamana wrote on Thursday in her last editorial that a new sunrise has happened in Maharashtra
 mumbai sahit sanyukt maharashtra kii ghoshnaa hote hi maharashtra ke man main anand kii tarangen uthi thim
 In the editorial, Saamana further wrote that on August 15, 1947, on the occasion of Independence Day, a magnificent ceremony was celebrated in the whole of India including Maharashtra, the same joy and enthusiasm is not only visible in Maharashtra but in the whole country
 maharashtra ke gathan kii ghoshnaa shivneri par hui or har marathi maanus utsaah, anand tathaa aashaa-apekshaaon se bhar uthaa tha
 Samana writes that even today there is no separate picture
 shivasena kaa mukhyamantri or usamen bhi uddhav thakare is pad par virajman ho rahe hai, ye maharashtra kaa bhagya he
 This ceremony will make Marathi Manus feel blessed
 jo uddhav thakare ko pahachaanate hai, unke man main ye vishwaas he ki jab ve koi jimmedaari sweekaar karte hai to use puri shiddat se nibhaate hai

 Aaj Tak asked Anil Sahu the question of how many people were there in Gehlot and his team
 anil ne bataaya ki mukhyamantri khud apane cabinet mantriyon ke saath pahunche the or jisamen 30 se 35 log aae the or kai log baahar bhi khadey the
 The second question was what was the topic of discussion of those people? Anil said, 'many issues were discussed and Gehlot has been coming to Sahu Tea Stall before and not only that, former Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has also many Bar Sahu has come to the tea stall and many politicians consider it auspicious for them
 sawaal phir uthaa ki jo log aae the, kya un sab ne chaay, ban muska or matari khai? to jawaab mila, haa sab ne inkaa anand liya tha
 The next question was who raised the expenses after eating and drinking, and the answer was that BD Kalla, the Energy Minister in the Gehlot government, had given 500 rupees
 aapako bataa den ki is dukaan par ek kullad chaay kii keemat 20 rupee, ek mathri 10 rupee, ban muska 30 rupee kaa he
 In such a case, the cost of a person is 60 rupees
 agar hisaab 50 rupee se bhi lagaaya jaae to 30 logon kaa kharch 1500 rupee baithta he par mantri ji to 500 rupee thama kar hi chalate bane

 @surbhijyoti 🤷🤷A post shared byaman Gandhi (@gandhi_aman_) onmay 19, 2018 at 10:48 am PDT Happy Hug Day 2019: vailemtine wyk chal rahaa he
 In this week, Hag Day is celebrated on February 12, 2 days before Valentine's Day
 apane krash yaa partner ko hag karne ke ehsaas se zyada khubasurat bhala kya ho saktaa he
 Emotions that cannot be conveyed through words can be sent to someone by embracing emotion
 ye din sirf lovers ke liye nahin hota he, balki ye din kisi ke saath bhi celibratt kiya ja saktaa he
 So, this Hug Day, along with your partner, do a loving hug to your parents, brothers, sisters, friends too, because embracing someone is a beautiful feeling, as well as health benefits
 is baat kaa pushti kai studies main kii ja chuki he
 These are the advantages of performing Hag-1
 dil ke liye phydemand-ek study kii report main bataaya gaya he ki hag karne se sharir main lav hormone oxitosin kaa str bad jaataa he
 This keeps the heart healthy
 2
 Blood pressure is low - According to scientists, doing hag also reduces blood pressure
 aisa sharir main oxitosin hormone nikalne kii vajah se hota he
 In a study conducted on 59 people, it is said that the people who frequently hug their partner, have their blood pressure under control
 3
 Stress is reduced - several studies have shown that the hag of a particular person reduces the level of the stress hormone cortisol
 hag karne se tanaav to kam hota hi he saath hi vyakti kii yaaddasht bhi tej hoti he
 4
 mood fresh hota he-shodhakartaaon kaa maananaa he ki hag karne se vyakti kaa mood bhi fresh rahata he
 Actually, when you hug someone, your brain produces an excess amount of serotonin hormone, which helps keep your mood fresh
 hag karne se vyakti ke kaam karne kii kshamta bhi badhati he
 5
 bimariyon kaa khatra kam hota he-kareeb 400 se adhik logon par hui study main shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki hag karne se vyakti ke biimaar hone kii sambhaavna kam hoti he
 People who get partner support tend to fall ill
 bandra-varli si link par ek sin board gaadi chalaane waalon kaa swaagat karata he jis par likhaa he 'dakshin mumbai
 'interestingly, the arrow on it actually points north
 is tarah gaadiyaan kareeb 150 meter tak galat disha main badhkar ek trephic sarkal se you turn lene ke baad phir us disha main badhati hai, jidhar unhen janaa hota he
 Ever since the bridge became operational for the common people in 2009, people from a particular section of Mumbai and the mood have been considering it as a symbol of the city's potential
 lekin yah si link mumbai ke liye asaliyat se zyada sajaavati muhaavara hi sabit hua he
 The cost of this bridge has been more than five times the estimate and it also took 10 years to build - five years more than the estimate
 yah pul sirf is vajah se shahar kii prashasnic aakshamata kaa pratik nahin he ki ise banane main zyada samay or paisa kharch hua
 1 living in Mumbai
 25 karod logon main se 72 lakh log rojaanaa baari bheed vaali local trainon se safar karte hai
 Only 40,000 vehicles pass through the sea link every working day
 saarvajanik yatayaat kii jagah nijee vaahanon ke liye infrastracchar par jor dena galat shahari niti or aloktantric raajnneeti, donon kaa hi parichaayak he
 Of course, despite all the enthusiasm for this bridge, Mumbaikars are not ready to loose their pockets for its use
 jab si link ko kholaa gaya to trephic itnaa kam tha ki prashasan ko toll tex ghataane ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Irrespective of this, the administration is still planning to extend this sea link to Nariman Point, the south end of the city
 haalanki pul ke bandra chor par laga sin board zyada sahi he, lekin iske aasapaas rahane waalon ke saamaajik-aarthik sankawtak bahut khush hone kii vajah nahin dete
 By the way, a survey shows that about 40 percent of the families living in this area have an income of Rs 10 lakh
 se zyada he, lekin chaunkaane vaala aankada yah he ki ech (west) municipal ward ke 78 fisadi log jhoparpatti main rahete hai
 Bandra is in this ward
 mumbai ke pairokaar akasar yah tark dete hai ki sabhi bade shaharon main aise anubhavon kii paraakaashtha pai jaati he
 If you look at it technically, the gap between the richest and the poorest is very deep here
 2001 kii janaganana ke mutabik mumbai ke 54 fisadi log jhoparpatti main rahete hai
 The marginalized life is indeed the largest in the commercial capital of India
 lekin halaat hameshaa se aise nahin the
 In most of the years of the last century, Mumbai was the city that fills most of India's imagination
 dashakon tak shahar kii jansankhya un pravaasiyon kii baadh kii vajah se badhati rahi jo maharashtra ke anya hisson yaa samooche bharat ke vibhinn ilaakon se aae the
 In the words of myth-makers, the crowd of migrants was dreaming of becoming rich in Mumbai
 lekin asaliyat main ve zyada vyaavhaarik the, ve shahar ke vibhinn kaarkaanon yaa unase jude udhyamon main se kisi ek main sthaayee rup se kaam kii chaah main aa rahe the
 In 1951, 72 percent of Mumbai's workers were employed in the organized sector
 lekin udaarikaran ke baad se isamen teji se badlaav shuru ho gaya
 0 in formal sector employment between 1981 and 2007
 83 fisadi kii har saal giravat ai
 The result of this was that this stream of migration-the dominant conundrum of the city's charm - diminished
 ab mumbai kii growth main prakritik badhat sabase bada kaarak he
 The informal sector still contributes about two-thirds of the city's employment
 udaarikaran ke saath aae 'shram niyamon ke lacheelepan' ke dabaav ne sab-contract, contract job or cajual rojgaar main baari badhotaree kii he
 This kind of informalization of the field of work has also affected the physical landscape of the city
 ek mumbai steel or kartin glass se chamchamati he to duusari mumbai ke hisse tirpal or tin kii chappar he
 The city is a symbol of neo-liberal inequalities
 mubai ke is dard main shahar ke sabase durlabh sansaadhan jameen se jude saudon main ghotaalon ke vilakshan str ne kai guna ijapha kiya he
 The permit raj of the last two decades has fostered a mutual nexus between rule-making leaders, bureaucrats who implement them, and builders seeking to break them
 kabhi-kabhaar hi unka bhandaphod ho paata he jaisaa ki kolaba ke adarsh apartment complex maamle main hua
 The building was approved 'for the welfare of the serving and retired personnel of the Defense Services', but many politicians and bureaucrats' families acquired apartments in it
 aarope he ki yah apartment unhen bazaar bhav se kaaphi kam keemat par die gaye
 The scandal has resulted in one chief minister losing his chair and two others under investigation, and three IAS officers, former municipal commissioner Jayaraj Pathak, former urban development secretary Ramanand Tiwari and former district collector in charge of the city's land records Pradeep Vyas has been arrested
 lekin niyamon ke aise kai ulanghan jaanch agenciyon yaa janata kii najaron main nahin aa paae hai
 Some of these are several construction projects under the city's Slum Rehabilitation Scheme
 is yojana ke tahat developers ko jhoparpattivasiyon kii khatir muft makaan banane ke liye dil kholkar suvidhaayen di jaati hai
 But the beneficiaries of many such projects have complained that the letters showing the consent of them are fake
 debpalars ko kaaphi bade plot die gaye hai, jabaki inke bahut chote hisse par jhoparpattivasiyon ko makaan die gaye hai or manjuuri se zyada makaan banane ke iraade se kai plot main developers ne jhoparpattiwalon kii sankhya badha-chadhaakar dikhaai he
 Last year, Medha Patkar, leader of the National Alliance of People's Movement, went on a hunger strike in Golibar in a slum rehabilitation colony for alleged violation of rules
 golibaar khaar purv main sthit 140 acre main faili jhuggi basti he
 He ended the strike after the state government agreed to form a two-member committee to investigate his allegations
 lekin iske kuch hafton baad hi mukhyamantri ne panel ko bhang kar diya
 When the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) was approved in 1995, the Maharashtra government estimated that around eight lakh houses needed to be built for rehabilitation
 iske 15 saal se bhi zyada samay baad is saal april main niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (sieji) ne jaankaree di ki vastav main sirf 1
 Only 27 lakh houses have been built, while in the meantime the number of slum dwellers has increased rapidly
 iske alaava jhuggi-jhopadivaasiyon ke sanghathanon kaa bhi jor he ki shahar kii aadhi se zyada jansankhya ko muft makaan dene kaa vichaar khota arthshaastra he, jisane mumbai ke property bazaar ko puri tarah se bigaad kar rakh diya he
 It is clear that this scheme does not work for anyone - except the builders, bureaucrats and leaders who continue to do it
 saaf taur se esare sarkari jameen ko nijee haathon main saunpane kaa prabhavi tantra he
 Along with Special Economic Zones (sezs) and mining projects, now sociologists have started telling the SRA another example of 'raising capital through eviction'
 aamchi mumbai kii samasya jitani vishalkay he, utani vishisht bhi
 But another city in the subcontinent is facing similar challenges
 mumbai kii tarah samudr ke kinare basaa karachi pravaasiyon or shahari vistaar ke boj se dab gaya he
 While the slums of Dharavi in mumbai are considered Asia's second largest slum, the Kutchi population of Orangi in Karachi has more such slums
 haalanki ye donon vishaal shahar ek hi tarah kii rajnatik antardhara ko saz karte hai: kuch maharashtravasi jahaan mumbai kii bahu-jaateey saanskrithik vishistataa se asahaj mahasoos karte hai, vaise hi sindhi apane praant ke is chor main badhate pravaasiyon ko lekar aisa hi duraav rakhte hai
 Though Karachi does not seem to be a place from which to solve any problem, the Sindh Local Bodies Ordinance, accepted in 2001, has introduced a method that Mumbai can adopt provided that Mumbai wants it to decide its urban affairs

 ' nirbhaya cese main 13 disambar ko hogi agali sunwaayeeis cese ke 2 doshi daakhil karne vaale hai yachika1 doshi kar chukaa yachika, chauthe kii jaankaree nahinpatiala house court ne aaj shuukravaar ko nirbhaya cese ke chaaron doshiyon ko notice jari kar diya he
 The court said in its order that everyone should tell whether they want to apply or not
 court ne ab is maamle main agali sunwaayee 13 disambar ko karegaa
 In the hearing held in the court today, the Tihar administration filed a status report on the four convicts of the Nirbhaya case in Patiala House Court
 tihaad jail prashasan ne court ko bataaya ki doshivinay ne dayaa yachika 4 disambar ko raashtrapatike saamne lagaai hui he
 While Mukesh and Pawan are going to file a curative petition in this case
 haalanki is maamle ke chauthe doshi akshay kaa philhal states saaf nahin he ki wo is maamle main koi curative pitishan yaa dayaa yachika lagaana chahta he yaa nahin
 How much waiting for justice? The lawyer appearing on behalf of Nirbhaya's parents said that how long will we have to wait for justice? The court told the amicus curiae that the court orders should be obeyed keeping the time limit in such cases
 court ne sawaal kiya ki jab tak dayaa yachika lambit he, tab tak court kaise deth warrant jari kar saktaa he
 Amicus Curiae said that in this case the court should fix a date that they are going to file a curative petition or mercy petition till this date

 The court said that according to the law and rule in this case, the court can order but the court cannot issue a death warrant without settling the mercy petition
 nirbhaya ke mata-pita ke vakil ne kaha ki curative pitishan doshiyon ke liye remedi he, unka adhikaar nahin he
 The court said that, but whatever remedy the convicts have, the court cannot deny them
 is maamle main emicas curi ne kaha ki pichley saal supreme court ne sabhi doshiyon kii apil khaarij hone ke baad bhi rajya sarkaar deth warrant jari karaane ke liye nahin ai, nirbhaya ke mata-pita aae hai, yani jo kaam sarkaar kaa tha, wo unhone kiya
 Female boxer L
 sarita devi ne antarrashtriya mukkebaaji sangh (eibie) se asian khelon main kaansya padak sweekaar karne se inkaar karne par hue asthai nilamban ko hataane kaa anurodh kiya or kaha ki unhen podium par apane vyavhaar kaa dukh he or vah aisa dobaaraa kabhi nahin karengi
 Sarita's chances of participating in the World Championship next month have been eroded due to the suspension imposed by Incheon for refusing to accept a medal after losing in the controversial semi-final of the Asian Games
 purv vishwa evam asian champion sarita ne eibie ke notice ke jawaab main likhaa, 'main sweekaar karti hum ki ye ghatnaayen nahin honi chahie thi or mujhe in ghatnaon kaa gaharaa pachhtaawaa he or main sankalp leti hum ki yah phir se kabhi nahin hoga
 He said, "realizing my mistakes, i sent a letter of apology to the Asian Olympic Council and the Organizing Committee of the Asian Games 2014 and accepted the bronze medal
 ' Sandeep Jajodia, president of Boxing India, also requested AIBA to lift the temporary suspension imposed on Sarita Devi, saying that this Indian boxer's unconditional apology and clean discipline record in the past will strengthen her side in front of the global body

 isisi world cap-2019 main guuruuvaar ko bhartiya team manchester ke old trevord maidan par westeindies se bhidegi
 Team India is invincible in this World Cup so far and they would like to retain the same order against the Windies
 vahiin, westeindies kai haar ke baad aatmavishvaas kii kami se jujh rahi he
 After winning the first three matches easily, India had to fight against Afghanistan in their last match, but Mohammad Shami's hat-trick in the last over saw India register their fourth victory in the Mahakumbh of cricket
 shami-bumraah par hogi jimmedaaribhubaneshwar ke chotil hone ke baad team main aae shami kaa westeindies ke khilaaf bhi khelnaa tay mana ja rahaa he kyonki bhubaneshwar kii chot ko lekar abhi sthiti saaf nahin hai
 Although he did practice for half an hour on Tuesday under the supervision of Physio, the team management would not like to take any risk regarding Bhubaneswar
 isliye shami or jasprit bumraah ke upar westeindies ke tufaani ballebaaji kram ko rokane kaa jimmaa hoga
 Karthik or Pant may get a chance
 If you talk about Indian batting, then everything is fine for him, only the number-4 problem
 vijay shankar ko do maichon main is sthaan par mauka diya gaya he, lekin vah iskaa phayda nahin uthaa paae
 Maybe against West Indies, India can try young Rishabh Pant and Dinesh Karthik at this number
 bharat ke madhya kram kaa lay main aana jarurfghanistan ke khilaaf ek baar phir bharat kii madhya kram kii chintaa saamne ai thi
 It has been seen for a long time that if one of India's top-3 batsmen could not survive, then India could not score big
 afghanistan ke khilaaf bhi yahi dekha gaya tha
 Windies will also try to send India's top three batsmen Rohit Sharma, Lokesh Rahul and Virat Kohli to the pavilion early
 westeindies ko khalegi rasel kii kamibharat ke khilaaf ahm match se pehle windies ko ek jhatka laga he
 Its star player Andre Russell has been ruled out of the World Cup
 rasel ne abhi tak world cap main vaisaa pradarshan nahin kiya tha, jiske liye vah jane jate hai
 But still the level of player he is, he can change the attitude of the match at any time
 ye galati karne se bachegi windies teawindies ke paas rasel jaise kuch or khilaadi hai, jinase bharat ko batch kar rahanaa hoga
 Carlos Braithwaite is one of them
 brathwet ne hi newjiland ke khilaaf windies ko jeet ke dwaar par laakar khadaa kar diya tha
 But the way in which he made a mistake while remaining five runs away and the team had to face defeat due to him, such a mistake will not only prevent the Braithwaite but the entire team
 windies ke paas kris gail, shai hope, shimron hetmer or captain jesan holder bhi hai jo badi paariyaan or teji se ran banane kaa dam rakhte hai
 The Windies bowlers have impressed the West Indies bowling is doing well in this tournament, especially Sheldon Cottrell
 vah behtareen form main hai
 Apart from them, Oshane Thomas, Shaun Gabriel, Captain Holder and Braithwaite are also in good rhythm
 bas dekhnaa yah hoga ki bharat ke majboot ballebaaji kram ke aage yah kis had tak apni acchhee lay ko kaayam rakh pate hai

 Neither the government nor the staff leaders have much to say about the 7th Pay Commission
 yah apane aap main badi vidmbana he ki saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko sarkaar ne june ke antim saptaah main lagu kiya tha
 The date of implementation of the recommendations of the Pay Commission was 1 January 2016
 hameshaa kii tarah vetan ayog kii kuch siforeeshon ko lekar karmchaariyon kii ore se gathbandhan ne aapatti jataai or sarkaar ne samitiyon kaa gathan kar har mudde par baatcheet ke liye karmchaariyon ke pratinidhiyon ko aamantrit kiya
 However, with the implementation of the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission, the employees were so angry that they threatened to go on strike
 dawaab main sarkaar ne samitiyon kaa gathan kiya tha
 The committees were to submit their report within four months
 lekin aath maheene biit gaye hai or alouns samiti main echaare ko chhodkar baaki muddon par koi baat puri nahin hui he
 There is no talk about HRA either
 vitt sachiv ke netritv main bani is samiti ne apni report de di he
 Apart from the HRA, staff leaders have spoken with the committee on more than two dozen allowances
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki kuch alounces ko lekar sarkaar kaa rukh kuch naram he or sarkaar kuch alounces ko yaa to phir se shuru kar sakati he yaa phir die ja rahe kuch alouns kii dar ko badha sakati he
 (7th Pay Commission: Allowance committee gave its report on HRA, Khushi and sorrow too) vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne ke nirnay liye aath maheene biit gaye hai lekin abhi tak karmchaaree netaaon or sarkaar ke pratinidhiyon ke bich kii barf pighalati dikh nahin rahi he
 (7th Pay Commission: Decision on HRA) now in government's hands, employee leaders said) sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar jo kuch thodaa bahut baatcheet main maamla sulajhata dikh rahaa he, vah nunatam vetanman, kuch alouns or echaare he
 That is, employees can get some good news on these things
 (kendriya karmchaariyon ke liye khushkhabari : 1 janvari se mahangaai bhatta 2 pratishat badha saktaa he centre)tippaniyan At the same time, the government is being said to maintain its stand on NPS and many other allowances
 yani in muddon par karmchaariyon ke haath abhi tak kii khabar ke mutabik niraashaa hi haath lagi he
 Staff leader Shivgopal Mishra told NDTV that the NPS issue would be discussed on March 17
 iske alaava baaki kuch alouns par bhi baatcheet hogi
 As usual, the coalition objected on behalf of some of the recommendations of the Pay Commission and the government formed committees and invited representatives of the employees to discuss every issue
 vaise saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ke lagu hone ke saath karmchaariyon main itnaa gussa tha ki unhone hadtaal par jane kii dhamkee de di
 The government formed committees under pressure
 samitiyon ko apni report chaar maheene main hi deni thi
 But eight months have passed and no issue has been completed in the Allowance Committee on issues other than HRA
 echaare ko lekar bhi kuch bhi baat nahin ho paa rahi he
 This committee, headed by the Finance Secretary, has given its report
 echaare ke ek alaava baaki do darjan se zyada alounces ko lekar samiti ke saath karmchaaree netaaon ne baat kii he
 It is reported from the sources that the government's stance on some allowances is somewhat soft and the government can either resume some allowances or increase the rate of some allowances being given
 (7waan vetan ayog : alouns samiti ne echaare (HRA) par di apni report, milegi khushi or gam bhi) Eight months have passed for the decision to implement the recommendations of the Pay Commission, but the snow has yet to be seen between the staff leaders and government representatives
 (7waan vetan ayog : echaare (HRA) par faisla ab sarkaar ke haath main, karmchaaree netaaon ne yah kaha) According to information received from the sources, what seems to be resolved in the negotiations, is the minimum pay scale, some allowance and HRA

 In such a situation, it is seen that as soon as they enter Noida from the border of Delhi, people start breaking the rules

 The Long Term Capital Gain (LTCG) has come back after nearly 14 years
 1 april, 2018 se equity mutual fund main nivesh karne waalon ko salanaa ek lakh ru
 10% LTCG tax will have to be paid on income above Rs
 baharhaal iske grandfadar praavdhaan kaa shukriya karen, jo aapako vitt varsh 2017-18 ke liye tex bharne se bachaa saktaa he
 However, there are some ways to reduce LTCG tax
 
 
 parijanon ke naam nivesh karankuch khaas parijanon (pita, patni, bachche) se mili uphaaron par tex nahin lagata
 Therefore, experts suggest that you divide your investment portfolio among your family members
 daalamia adwijuri sarvice ke sansthaapak brajesh daalamia bataate hai, "har vyakti ko ek lakh ru
 Up to Rs
 parijanon ke bich portpholio ko baant lene ke kaaran aap tex bahut kam yaa naganya kar sakate hai
 Investment in the name of children will be exempted only if they are 18 years of age or above
 aisa isliye kyonki tex niyamon ke anusaar 18 saal yaa usase adhik umr ke bacchon ko apane adhikaar praapt hai or unhen swatantra vyakti (indiviual) ke rup main gina jaataa he
 By reflecting the long term capital loss, LTCG tax on equity based mutual funds can be saved by reflecting the long term capital loss on investment in shares or equity-based mutual funds
 misaal ke taur par, mutual fund skim "e'' main nivesh par kisi vyakti kaa 2 lakh ru
 The LTCG is formed and 1 on equity mutual fund scheme "B"
 25 lakh kaa long turm capital los hua he
 In such a situation, he can adjust the tax by showing the losses incurred on scheme "B" along with the advantages of scheme "A"
 agar niveshak ko diarect equity shares main bhi koi long turm capital los hua he, to use bhi darshaakar vah tex bachaa saktaa he
 In the above case the net LTCG is Rs 75,000
 kaa hi hua (2 lakh ru
 Out of the benefits of Rs 1
25 lakhs, Rs
 kaa nuksaan ghataakar) jo ki ek lakh ru
 Is below the exemption limit
 is par niveshak altisiji kii bachat kar saktaa he
 Re-investing is another way to minimize dentax
 aap portpholio kaa manthan karen kyonki altisiji kii gananaa adhigrahan kii vaastavik laagat par hoti he
 You can change the cost of acquisition by making a small change in the portfolio
 maan len ki 20 april, 2018 ko 180 ru
 You bought 1,000 units of a mutual fund scheme at a net asset value (NAV) of Rs
 april 2019 tak uskaa enevi 260 ru
 done
 is tarah aapkaa 80,000 ru
 Ka Long Term Capital Gain
 agar aap saare units 27 april, 2019 ko bech dete hai or phir se use kharid lete hai to aapkaa kharid mulya ab 260 ru
 And the purchase date will be 27 April 2019
 ab agar agle saal enevi badhkar 345 ru
 Becomes Rs 85,000
 ho jaaegi jo ki ek lakh ru
 Is less than the tax limit and you will not have to pay tax
 haalanki bahut se log is ranneeti ko apnaane kaa suzav nahin dete
 —kundan Kishore *** bhartiya mahila hockey team kaa ravivaar ko dakshin korea ke khilaaf khelaa gaya match 1-1 se drow rahaa
 India won the five-match series 3–1 with an equal match

 In the first three quarters, both teams made every effort to score goals, but no one got success
 chauthe quarter main khel main or teji dekhne ko mili
 Vandana took a pass from captain Rani to the goal post of Korea and gave India a 1-0 lead
 lekin, mehmaan team kii khushi thode samay tak hi rahi
 South Korea's Bomi Kim (50 minutes) scored an equalizer two minutes later

 loksabhaa chunaavon main congress kii haar ko lekar team rahul par congress ke andar se hi hamale hone lage hai
 Many Congress leaders have said in unison that only those people with leadership experience and rigorous self-inspection should be given leadership to help the party regain its lost base
 pehle kendriya mantri milind devda ne rahul ke salaahkaaron par haar kaa thikra phoda ab unke sur main sur milaate hui kai congressi diggajon ne party netritv par aparoksh hamalaa karnaa shuru kar diya he or ek sur main bade str par badlaav kii maang karne lage hai
 This entire issue was started by former Congress minister Milind Deora after he blamed Rahul's advisors for the defeat, saying that Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's advisers were not aware of the ground reality and had no electoral experience, They were making decisions
 iske baad ek-ek kar kai saansadon ne is par pratikriya di or dabe swar main hi sahi lekin sheersh netritv ko chunavi haar ke liye jimmedaar tehraate hue aage sanghathan main bade badlaav kii baat kii
 Tharoor said - In Milind's talk, after Shashi Hamilind Deora's attack, Shashi Tharoor also reacted like this
 tharur ne kaha, ‘milind ek achche dost hai or achche saansad bhi or unki hi tarah bahut se saansadon kaaryakartaaon congress adhyaksh ke saamne apni-apni baaten rakhi hai or wo is par karrwai karengi
 There is sense in what Milind is talking about
 lekin rahul ke salaahkaaron main keval takneekee visheshgy hai
 He has young mps Jitendra Singh, RPN Singh, Sachin Pilot and Murali Deora among the political advisors
 unke paas raajnneetik samaj he isliye hamen is par behad gambhirtha se vichaar karnaa hoga
 Tharoor said, 'lack of communication with Rahul Gandhi also played a big role
 ham unase roj nahin mil sakate
 But it is also true that Rahul is the only one and not every one of us can always meet him
 ’ unhone aage kaha, ‘party main khulkar vichaar hona chahie
 There should be open dialogue within the party on this defeat
 ’payalat bhi badlaav chaahate harrjmer se kareeb 1
 Losing by 7 lakh votes, the Rajasthan unit president of the Congress, Sachin Pilot, took responsibility for the loss of all seats in Rajasthan and said that he will now work on the strategy ahead
 haalanki payalat ko apni haar kaa yakeen nahin he wo kehete hai, ‘maine ajmer main ek hawaii adda, 43 nai trainen, ek kendriya vishvavidhyalay or mahila mahavidhyalay khulwaaye iske baad bhi haar kaise hui is par yakeen nahin hota he
 The pilot, however, did not raise any direct questions on the leadership of Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh, but spoke of a change in the organizational structure
 payalat ne kaha, ‘abhi main keval itnaa kah saktaa hum ki hamen sanghathanaatmak dhaanche kii puri marammat kerani hogi
 There will be election for every post in the party
 hamen party se anaavashyak logon ko turant baahar karnaa hoga
 Those who reach out to the common people will have to reach the top positions in the party
 ’‘badi degree nahin jamini hakeekat kaa gyaan jaruri’arpyen singh ne kaha, ‘rahul gandhi ko apane votaron ke saath or adhik baaten kerani chahie thim
 He was in favor of a complete change in the party and the Congress Working Committee, while leaders like Ajay Maken and Shashi Tharoor who have mastered their voice to the voters should be given a bigger role
 ek raajnneetik party enjio nahin ho sakati
 It is good to get a degree from big colleges, but if they are not aware of the ground reality, then they will not be able to take decisions
 hamen unase chhutkaaraa paanaa chahie
 "deora's point is very right", while senior Congress leader Satyavrat Chaturvedi also appeared to agree with Milind Deora's views
 unhone ummid jataai ki samasyaon ko dur karne ke liye eemaandaar or kathor aatm nirikshan kiya jaayegaa
 He said that what Deora has said may not be completely correct but a large part of what he has said is correct
 party main is badhati dharna ke maddenjar ye tippaniyan mahatvapurn samajhi ja rahi he ki aise anek logon ko jinhen na to chunaavon kaa koi anubhav tha na hi raajnneeti kii baarikiyon kii samaj thi unhen prachaar or gathbandhan jaise muddon par netritv ke nirnay ko aakaar dene main mahatvapurn bhoomika di gai
 Congress leaders have turned away from the public: Priya Dutt: Secretary of the All India Congress Committee, Priya Dutt met Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 is mulaakaat ke baad priya dutt ne bhi janata ke saath party netaaon kii duuri banane kii baat kii
 He said that we have to bridge this distance
 pichley das varshon main hamase kahaan galati hui, us par bhi hamen gaur karnaa hoga
 Both Milind Deora and Priya Dutt have lost in the recent Lok Sabha elections
 congress ke varisht netaa amarinder singh ne haalanki kaha ki is paraajay ke liye party ko samuhik jimmedaari leni chahie
 Deora blew up, with former Union Minister Milind Deora blaming Rahul's advisors for the defeat, saying that Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's advisers were not aware of the ground realities and had no electoral experience, they were taking decisions
 dakshin mumbai se purv saansad or kendra main mantri rahe milind devda ne phir kaha ki unki yah tippanee party ke prati gahari nishtha or chunaavon main uske kharaab pradarshan se hui pidaa se upji he
 Deora said on Twitter, my comment stems from feelings of deep loyalty to the party, anguish over our performance in elections and a sincere desire to see the party rebounded
 isse adhik kuch nahin
 In another comment on Twitter, he said, grassroots party work and electoral struggle are important to understand the ground realities
 yah congress main netritv ke padon ke liye aadhaar bananaa chahie
 See what Deora tweeted: My comments are out of emotions of deep loyalty to the party, pain of our performance & a sincere desire to see us bounce back
 Nothing more— Milind Deora (@milinddeora)may 22, 2014field party work & electoral battles are key to comprehend ground realities

 jabaki lagbhag ek darjan se zyada aparaadhiyon ko giraftaar kiya he
 However, the police action is not showing any effect on the miscreants

 As soon as evening fell on Friday, there were two encounters in Noida and Greater Noida in just half an hour
 police ne do ghayal samet teen badmaashon ko giraftaar kiya
 The first encounter took place in Noida
 yahaan se police ne ek bike, 1,05,000 rupee nagdi, avaidh hathiyaar sahit kuch kaartoos baraamad kiye
 According to the police, at the end of the evening, the Sector-20 police of Noida conducted a checking operation on the information of the informer in Sector-8
 isi dauraan police ne jab do bike savaar sandigdhon ko rukne kaa ishaara kiya to donon aaropee police par firing karte hue bhaagane lage
 The police pursued cross-firing at a short distance in which a miscreant named Mushir was shot in the leg and was injured, while Harsha, the other accomplice of this miscreant, was arrested by the police
 police ne ghayal ko ilaaj ke liye jila aspataal main bhartee karaayaa he
 Initial investigation has revealed that Mushir is a resident of Nandanagri in Delhi and he has about two dozen robbery, murder cases
 ye shaks noida main kisi lut kii vaardaat main bhi vaanchit tha
 While Noida was trying to nab the miscreants, news came from Greater Noida that a police encounter with two miscreants had happened during the checkup near the Daga roundabout

 Though it is a flat state of the situation of september-october 2015 after the communal violence in Bishera village of Gautam Budh Nagar, but if it is replaced by villages like kutwa-kutvi, Phugana, Hasanpur or Lisad in Muzaffarnagar, the date is September 2013
 Even if given, the inevitable culmination of both developments will appear to be similar
 darasal, do saal pehle pashchimi uttar pradesh ke gaanvon main sampradayikta ke barbar ho jane kaa jo silsilaa shuru hua, vah ganga kinare purvi uttar pradesh ko paar karte hue bihar or pashchim bengal tak failata dikhataa he
 In January this year, five people were killed and houses of more than 50 Muslims were burnt in the name of "love Jihad" in Ajitpur Bahilwara in Muzaffarpur, Bihar
 bihar main sampradayik tanaav kii yah iklauti ghatana nahin he, haalanki anya ghatnaayen itnaa tool nahin pakad sakin
 In May this year, fierce communal clashes took place in Nadia, West Bengal
 donon pakshon ne ek-duusare par gole phenke
 Most of the houses in the area were destroyed
 hindu samudaay ke chaar log maare gaye, vahiin aath log ghayal hue
 It is considered the most dangerous of recent violence there
 or to or, uttarakhand jaise apekshaakrit shant rajya ke kotdwar shahar main 29 sitambar ko ek tractor kisi dukaan ke saamne pattharon ke dher se takaraayaa or yah maamla sampradayik jhagade main badal gaya
 Four people were injured in the incident and section 144 had to be imposed in the area
 in ghatnaon ke jariye sampradayikta kaa vah jehar samay-samay par foot padataa he, jise bade suniyojit dhang se samaaj main udela ja rahaa he
 Obviously, the nature of the dispute changes in terms of political-social fabric of the region and the state, but the nature remains the same
 vivaad kii jo vajahen gadhi jaati hai, unamem gohatya kii afvaah, mandir yaa masjid kaa laudspikar, ladakiyon ke saath chhedchhad yaa shlav jehadya or kabhi-kabhi to sadak par do vaahanon main hui takkar bhi aag bhadakaane ke liye kaaphi najar aati he
 It is also not a coincidence that the Lok Sabha elections were the political destination of violence that started two years ago in West UP, then in the face of the latest violence, the current Bihar elections, the West Bengal elections next year and the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections to be held next year
 The stones are standing
 badhati hinsa kii tasdik kendriya grih mantralay ke aankade bhi karte hai
 While there were 252 incidents of communal violence in the first six months of 2014 in the country, in 2015, these incidents increased to 330
 2014 ke pehle chah maheene mote taur par manmohan singh sarkaar ke kaarykaal main aate hai, jabaki 2015 ke aankade modi sarkaar ke daur ke hai
 But Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not spoken about communal riots or tensions till date
 na to ve tab kuch bole jab dilli se sate faridabad main sampradayik danga hua or na ve ab bol rahe hai, jab khud unke sansadeey kshetra varanasi kii hawa kharaab ho rahi he
 Writers like Nayantara Sehgal and Ashok Vajpayee have also returned their Sahitya Akademi Saqman to break their silence
 vahiin uttar pradesh ke alpsankhyak maamalon ke mantri ajam khan ne india today se kaha, “modiji ye bataa den ki unke hindu raashtra main musalamaanon kii kya sthiti hogi
 If they would have given us an answer, the UN would not have needed to write a letter
 ”uttar pradesh to sampradayikta kii sabase jarkhez jameen banakar ubhara he
 If we take the example of western Uttar Pradesh, then there are reports of similar violence from Moradabad after Bishera village
 udhar, sitambar ke shuru main agra ke shikohabad main sampradayik tanaav dekha hi ja chukaa he
 Turning to eastern Uttar Pradesh, there was a fierce clash between the monks and the administration over the immersion of Ganesh in the Prime Minister's parliamentary constituency Varanasi
 varanasi kaa najaara kuch aisa tha ki jin sadakon par shraddhalu haathon main phool liye jate the, 5 aktubar kii shaam saadhe chaar baje inhen tang galiyon main har haath main pathar the
 This was Varanasi's most famous Godauliya chairaha and a crowd of thousands were bent on burning jeeps, motorcycles, pickets to everyone to express their outrage at the police administration
 kuch hi der main dhu-dhu karti aag or inase uthte kaale dhuen ne varanasi ke hriday sthal goduliya ko dhak diya
 a dozen vehicles were set ablaze
 bavaal ke failane kii ashanka main prashasan ne chaar thana kshetron main cocraru laga diya
 To hide their failure, the police registered a case of inciting a riot of 50 people, including Swami Avimukteshwarananda, Satua Baba, Mahant Baba Balak Das of Patlapuri Math
 iske baad se puure pradesh main ek baar phir sapa sarkaar ne hindutvvaadi takaton ko ekajute hone kaa mauka de diya he jisase aane vaale dinon main pradesh main sampradayik tanaav kii ghatnaayen or jor maar sakati hai
 Sensing this apprehension, Chief Secretary Alok Ranjan has issued a warning of strict action against the officers there in case of any untoward incident in any district
 purv police mahanideshak ke
 L
 gupta bataate hai, “upi main bade paimaane par sampradayik tanaav kii ghatnaayen yah bhi jaahir karti hai ki sapa sarkaar kii inako rokane kii manshaa nahin he
 Why not believe his statement when the government minister Azam Khan himself wrote a letter to the DGP two days before Eid about the possibility of violence against Muslims in the name of animal slaughter, despite the violence in Bishera
 yahaan ek cheez or gaur karne vaali he ki bisaheda main agar bijepi netaa sangeet som, sthaneey saansad or kendriya mantri mahesh sharma ko sampradayik tanaav failaane kaa aaropee banaaya ja rahaa he to varanasi main congress vidhayak ajay raay par thik yahi aarope laga he
 That is, the Congress, which has been marginalized in front of the bjp's fiery Hindutva, also does not want to leave Lokalaj and slowly look out of the agenda of true Hindutva
 aise main sawaal yah uth rahaa he ki agar satta paksh or vipaksh donon hi sampradayik unmaad ko kaabo karne kii bajaae yaa to use badhaava dene kaa kaam karen yaa phir uske bahaav main bah jaaen to loktantric bharat kaa saamaajik taana-bana kaise bachaaya jayega? is sawaal par pandit jawaharlal nehru kaa 4 june, 1949 ko rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ko likhaa khat praasangik ho jaataa he
 Panditji wrote, “communalism certainly attracts idealists as well as opportunists
 lekin iske kaam karne kaa dharra aisa he ki yah naitikta ke kisi bhi maanak se or bharat kii kisi tarah kii bhalaai se dur ho jaati he
 Its thinking is different
 lekin isamen thodaa-sa adarshavaad hota he jo naujavaanon ko apni taraf khinchataa he

 ek din pehle hi unhonebike reliki taiyaariyon kaa jayja lene ke liye bina number kii bullate kii sawari kii thi
 How aware Khattar is about Amit Shah's bike rally can be gauged from the fact that he himself drove the bullet to the venue by driving a bullet from the helipad

 The Chief Minister said that Jindhariyana comes in the middle
 isiilie bike raily ke liye is jile ko chunaa he

 abhinetri jaya pradaa (actress Jaya Prada) amar singh ko apana ‘godfadar' maanati hai
 Although Jayaprada says that even if he ties a rakhi to Amar Singh, people will not stop making talks about him
 jayaprada ne sapa netaa or rampur se vidhayak ajam khan par bhi gambhir aarope lagaae or daawa kiya ki ajam khan ne unke upar tejaab hamalaa karaane kii koshish kii thi
 In fact, a former Lok Sabha member from Rampur in Uttar Pradesh formed the Rashtriya Lok Manch with Amar Singh (jaya prada-amar Singh) after he was expelled from the SP
 jayaprada (actress Jaya Prada) ne amar singh ke saath apane sambandhon ke bare main nakaaratmak baaten kiye jane par kaha, ‘mere jivan main kai logon ne meri madad kii he or amar singh ji mere god fadar hai'
 Jaya Prada claimed during a conversation at the Queensline literature fest in Mumbai, 'the situation in which i was contesting as a woman with Azam Khan, when i was attacked by an acid And my life was in danger
 
 
 jab kabhi main ghar se baahar jaati main apni maa ko yah bhi nahin bataa sakati thi ki main jinda lautoongi yaa nahin'
 He said that no leader came forward to support him
 jayaprada (jaya Prada) ne kaha, ‘mulaayam singh ji ne mujhe ek baar bhi phone nahin kiya'
 Jayaprada said that she had even thought of committing suicide when she was made viral on social media after making a disgraceful change in her pictures
 jayaprada ne kaha, ‘amar singh (jaya Prada) dialysis par the or meri tasveeron main vidweshpurn badlaav kar use kshetra main failaayaa ja rahaa tha
 i was crying and saying that i don't want to live anymore, i want to commit suicide
 main sadame main thi or kisi ne meraa samarthan nahin kiya''
 He told, "amar Singh ji stood with me only after coming from dialysis, supported me
 aap unke bare main kya sochate hai? godfadar yaa phir koi or? yadi main unhen raakhi bhi baandh duun tab kya log baaten karnaa band kar denge? log kya kehete hai mujhe parvaah nahin''
 He said that it is a real challenge for a woman to become a leader in this system of men
 jayaprada ne kaha, ‘‘ek party se saansad rahane ke dauraan bhi mujhe nahin bakhsha gaya

 pichley dinon khabar ai thi ki nae saal se tivi dekhnaa or mahangaa ho jayega, kyonki doorsanchaar niamak praadhikaran (TRAI) ne cabel channelon ke shulk main badhotaree kar di he
 But now TRAI itself has rejected such news completely
 tri kii safitrai kaa kahana he ki prasaaran or cabel sevaaon kii nai ruparekha ke lagu hone se televijan darshakon ko pehle kii apeksha kam bhugtan karnaa hoga
 TRAI also criticized those who created confusion by promoting misinformation among consumers
 29 disambar se mahangaa hoga TV dekhnaa?darasal tri 29 disambar se emarpy niyam lagu karne ja rahi he, lekin cabel vyavsaay se jude logon kaa kahana he ki nae niyam ke lagu hone se logon kaa kharch or bad jayega
 Viewers will have to pay three to four times more to watch their favorite channel
 keval vyavsaay se jude jaankaron kii maane to abhi tak jo 100 channel cabel or DTH graahakon free main dekhne ko mil rahaa tha, nae niyam ke lagu hone se uske bhi alag se 130 rupee chukaane honge
 Till now these 100 channels are given free with every package
 khaskar manoranjak channelon ko dekhnaa or bhi mahangaa ho jayega
 Because cable subscribers who are currently paying 150 to 200 rupees to watch their favorite entertainment channels, they will have to pay more than 600 rupees
 yahi nahin, khabar ye thi ki echdi channel dekhne waalon ko har maheene kam se kam 800 se 900 rupee kharch karne padenge
 TRAI chairman told what will change but now TRAI chairman r es
 Sharma himself has described such news as a rumor
 unhone kaha ki praadhikaran upabhoktaaon ko kisi bhi tarah se prabhavit hone se bachaate hue nai ruparekha ke aasaan kriyanvayan ko lekar kaam kar rahaa he
 Without naming anyone, Sharma said, "this is a great framework and it has been validated by the country's largest court
" lekin yahaan kuch aise bhi sambandhit log hai jo yah dushprachaar kar rahe hai ki upabhoktaaon ko ab adhik bill bharna hoga, yah bakawaas he
 Launching the propaganda, the chairman of TRAI said that the new framework will ensure improvement in service quality, lower burden on consumers in terms of interconnection and fees, better transparency, etc

 These findings are a 189-page report titled 'six Years After the Sachar Committee Report: a Review of Socially Inclusive Development Sins 2006 and Reconciliation on Policies and Programs', which India Today has a copy of
 isamen 10 adhyay hai, jinamein artiai, sarkari or nijee report ke aadhaar par yah bataaya gaya he ki sachhar kii siforeeshon ke chah saal baad bhi musalamaanon kii saamaajik-aarthik-shaikshik haalat main badlaav nahin aayaa he
 In 2005, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh constituted a committee headed by Chief Justice of Delhi High Court Justice Rajinder Sachar to know the socio-economic and educational condition of Muslims in the country
 403 pej kii report ko 30 november, 2006 ko loksabhaa main pesh kiya gaya
 For the first time it was found that the condition of Indian Muslims is worse than the SC / ST
 samiti ne bhartiya musalamaanon ko samaan avasar muhaiyaa karaane ke liye kai tarah ke suzav die the or saath hi uchit mechanism apnaane kaa bhi suzav diya tha
 One of the six members of the committee was the then Senior Fellow / Chief Economist of the Delhi-based National Council of Applied Economic Research and now the Chief Scholar of the us-india Policy Institute, Washington, Dr
 abusaleh sharif kii is report se jaahir he ki musalamaanon ke prati sarkaar kii udaseenta se halaat badtar ho rahe hai
 Dr
 sharif ne apni report vibhinn sroton se jutaaye gaye aankadon ke aadhaar par taiyaar kii he
 a report from the New Delhi-based Center for Equity Studies states, "funds and services fixed for Muslim families and communities are sent to areas where there are few or no Muslims
 ”isi tarah 12 gaanvon main soshal or deveopmental infrastracchar ke surveykshan par soshal equity watch kii report ke hawaale se kaha gaya he, “skool, anganwari, swasthya centre, saste rashan kii dukaan, sadak or peyajal suvidha jaise sanketakon ke data se jaahir hota he ki essi, asti or alpsankhyakon ke aabaadi vaale gaanvon or awasaiya ilaakon main in chizon kii kaaphi kami he
 "not only this, according to the 27th report of the Parliament's Apex Committee on Social Justice and Empowerment," the committee found that the Minority Concentration District (MCD) did not make full use of the money
 yahi nahin, fund jila str par aavantit kiya jaataa he or yah un block main zyada chalaa gaya jahaan alpsankhyakon kii taadaad kam he
 “achieving literacy, education and ability is the foundation of livelihood and good lifestyle in 21st century India
 matriculation tak kii shiksha se kamgaaron kii sankhya main ijapha hota he
 Among all the socio-religious communities including SC-ST, education up to matriculation was the lowest among Muslims
 rojgaar ke maamle main yah chankane vaala he ki manaregaa main musalamaanon kii bhigidaari naganya he
 They are ignored from the time of issuing job cards
 yahi nahin musalamaanon ko ‘maas anganwari’ kaarykram, primary or elementary shiksha kaarykram or maas micro credit program jaise pramukh kaaryakramon main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 But bureaucracy does not care if qualified Muslims stay out of this program, nor do politicians care about it
 pradhanmantri ne sansad main bayaan diya tha ki bhartiya loktantr ke dhaanche ke bheetar sarkari sansadhano par pehla daawa alpsankhyakon kaa he, lekin aisa koi saboot nahin he ki sarkaar is jimmedaari ko nibhaa rahi he
 a committee of prominent bankers found that the government was not ready to give loans to minorities, especially Muslims
 dhyaan rahe ki bank kaa karj vittiya inklujan kaa sanketak hota he
 Gujarat is obstinate in this matter
 desh ke 121 alpsankhyak bahul jilon main sirf 26 fisadi khate alpsankhyakon ke hai, jabaki karj sirf 12 fisadi he
 Even among those minorities, the loan to Muslims is negligible
 sachhar kii sifarish ke chah saal baad bhi banking ke maamle main halaat bigade hai
 The report says that the ability to borrow from the National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation is very limited
 desh ke kareeb 20 karod alpsankhyakon main se zyaadaatar garib hai or ayog ne pichley 17 saal main swarozgaar ke liye sirf 1,750 karod ru

 Reserve Bank Strict On Salary Of Officers Of Private Banks, Now The Variable Pay Of Top Officers Can Go Up To Zero Percent In the case of rigerv bank ne nijee bainkon ke sheersh adhikariyon ke vetan ke bare main niyamon main aisa badlaav kiya he jisase ab kharaab pradarshan karne vaale bainkon ke adhikari moti selary nahin le paaenge
 The Reserve Bank on Monday revised the guidelines for salaries to ceos, ceos, Whole Time Directors (wtds) and Material Risk Takers (mrts) of private and foreign banks

 It states that if the financial performance of a bank is poor, the variable compensation to its top officer can be reduced to zero
 vairieble compenseshan yaa vairieble pe vetan kaa vah hissaa hota he, jo pradarshan par aadhaarit hota he
 Bank officials have been taking fat salary
 It is important that despite the condition of the banks, their top officers have been taking fat salary

 Amitabh Chaudhary, who took charge as CEO of Axis Bank in January, was second in the list of bank executives with a monthly salary of Rs 30 lakh
 kotak mahindra bank ke udai kotak 27 lakh rupee ke masik vetan ke saath tisare number par the
 Allowances and other items are not included in this calculation of salary, as they are given differently in different banks
 bainkon ke chif agjicutive kii selary ke aankade bainkon kii salanaa report se mili hai
 The regulatory guidance that preceded it was a general directive to fix the salary and allowances of senior officers on the basis of functions like 'business,' 'control' and 'risk'
 lekin ab arabiai ne jo niyam banaae hai unka sidhaa sambandh siio ke kampanajeshan se hoga
 However, the RBI guidelines also state that all fixed items of salary such as prequisite, performance bonus, guaranteed bonus, severance package, share linked instruments such as employee stock options (esops), pension plans, gratuity etc
 Will be considered as part of fixed pay
 rigerv bank ne kaha he kifixd pe or vairieble pe ke bich uchit santulan honi chahie
 According to the Reserve Bank, ceos, wtds and mrts can be offered as variable pay share linked instruments or as a mix of cash and share linked instruments
 niyam ke mutabik vetan kaa kam se kam 50 fisadi hissaa vairieble pe ke rup main hona chahie or yah sambandhit vyakti ke pradarshan, uske kaarobaar or form ke vyapak pradarshan par aadhaarit ho
 What the Reserve Bank has said, 'the variable pay should be higher at the higher level of responsibility
 haalanki kul vairieble pe phixd pe ke 300 fisadi se zyada nahin ho saktaa
 If variable pay is up to 200 per cent of fixed pay then at least 50 per cent of it and if it is over 200 per cent of fixed pay then at least 67 per cent of it should be in non-cash mode
 rigerv bank ne yah bhi kaha he ki jwine yaa sin-in bonus keval share linkd instrument ke rup main hona chahie

 a post shared by Sui Dhaaga (@suidhaagafilm) on Feb 12, 2018 at 10:51pm PST One such garba is a topic of discussion in Gujarat these days, which everyone is surprised to see
 ye garba he jinda saanp ke saath khelnaa
 These garbage in Rajkot are only done by young girls
 haathon main jinda saanp lekar gujarat ke rajkot mengarbakia jaataa he
 These small girls take the form of mother Khodal herself
 haathon main saanp lekar bina dare yahaan ki ladkiyaan kariban 2 se 3 ghante tak garba karti hai, jo dekhne waalon ko aashcharyachakit kar detaa he
 This special garba is organized in Rajkot through the Muralidhar Youth Group
 ye navaratri ke nau dinon tak hota he, jisamen choti-choti bacchiyaan haathon main saanp lekar garba khelti hai or dekhne vaale hajaaron logon ke liye sawaal khadaa kar detii hai
 In this program, especially everyday, different girls are given in hands with poisonous snakes, with which these girls thrash
 haalanki pehle van vibhaag ne bhi sawaal khadey kiye the, lekin jab dekha ki saanp kaa puri tarah se khyaal rakhaa jaataa he or ye bina jehar ke hote hai to khud van vibhaag ne bhi isaki chhut de di

 As such, Mamta Banerjee and the Left are fierce opponents of each other
 par sipiai kaa maananaa he ki vah modi ko rokane ke liye kuch bhi kar sakate hai
 CPI leader AB Vardhan said that he had no qualms in forging an alliance with West Bengal Chief Minister and his party Trinamool Congress due to political reasons
 vardhan ne ek news channel se kaha, 'agar modi ko rokna sambhav rahaa he to ham aisa karenge
 i do not give more than 160-170 seats to BJP, with this number the NDA will not win more than 210 seats
 aise main bijepi ko shashan main aane se rokna hamaara makasad hoga
 All options are open regarding this, even if it is to bring Mamata Banerjee along? ”it is worth noting that nothing has been said by Mamta Banerjee's party on this statement of Vardhan
 mamata banerjee kaa left virodh jagajaahir he
 After defeating the Left Front government in 2011, Mamta has often blamed the Left for the plight of West Bengal

 This is complete Hitlership

 Lokshahi means consent, in which the opposition and the public must also agree
 jab piem ke bolne ke andaaj par lee chutakiapana sambodhan shuru karte hi sinha ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bolne ke andaaj par chutki lee

 bhartiya khel jagat ko ek baar gatiman hone ke mauka tab mila, jab beijing olympic main abhinav bindra ne swarna padak hasil kiya
 Simultaneously, Vijender and Sushil took possession of the bronze
 kaamanwealth khelon ne puraani in kamyaabiyon ke kram ko ekbar phir se gati de di he
 Abhinav Bindra, Sushil Kumar, Vijender Singh and other Indian stars who have succeeded in the Commonwealth have no less than their inspiration
 kuch abhibhavak apane bacchon ko is baat ke liye prerit karenge ki ve khel ko hi apana kariyar banaaen
 Now ask Pullela Gopichand what the positive effect of Saina Nehwal's historic victory was
 aap jaan sakenge ki aise ladke-ladakiyon kii taadaad kaaphi he, jo hyderabad sthit unki badminton academy main pravesh paane kii laalasaa apane man main sanjoe hai
 The revolution that is underway in the world of sports is now coming true
 cyna se pehle, yahi kaam sania ne tennis ke kshetra main kiya
 Haryana has become a shining example of protecting young talent and utilizing the energy hidden in them
 vijender, akhil or susheel se prerit hokar or rajya sarkaar se sakriy sahyog paakar kai yuva ab kushti or boxing ko apana kariyar bana rahe hai
 It is a fact that this time in Haryana, the players of Haryana alone got 15 gold medals in their bag
 agar ham haryana kii ek swatantra desh ke rup main kalpana karen, to yah paaenge ki 15 swarna ke saath padak talika main yah paanchaven sthaan par kabiz hua hota
 This in itself is a unique example of what the youth of India cannot achieve on the strength of hard work and by getting more opportunities
 mukhyamantri bhupender singh hooda ke sangrakshan main haryana ab khiladiyon kii sharansthali ban chukaa he
 They have instilled confidence in others that if they perform brilliantly in the game, they will provide them with a good government job as well as sufficient money, so that the players and their families do not have difficulty in living
 shahari madhyavarg se taalluk rakhane vaale kisi shaks ke liye bhale hi dspi kii naukari khaas myne na rakhti ho, par unke liye yah bahut badi cheez he, jo nirdhan gaanvon se aate hai or dashakon se abhaav main ji rahe hai
 Now let us see where Haryana stood in the last Commonwealth Games
 saal 2006 main melbourne kaamanwealth main is rajya ke khiladiyon ne 1 swarna padak, 3 rajat padak or 1 kaansya padak jeeta tha
 Then in the next four years, players of this state managed to win 15 out of 38 gold medals
 yah apane aap main kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin he
 Our country should be thankful to Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his government for the fact that it gave such a large number of successful players
 ab har champion sainkadon yuvakon ko khel main kaamyaab banane ko prerit karegaa
 Perhaps sports may not be a priority for up's Mayawati government, Tamil Nadu's Karunanidhi government or Karnataka's Yeddyurappa
 jin rajyon main prabhavi prashasan maujuud he, jaise ki narendra modi, nitish kumaar, ashok gahalout, shivaraj singh chouhan aadi ke rajya main, vahaan khelon main haryana jaisi kamyaabi pai ja sakati he
 Imagine if there is a competition in these states, which state collects how many medals in international sports
 aisi sthiti main 2014 ke glosgo kaamanwealth main bharat ke kul swarna pad 38 se dogune tak ho sakate hai
 It is not just a mere imagination, but India is perfectly capable of passing this tax
 duniya kii kul aabaadi kaa chatha bhaag hamaare hi desh main nivas karata he
 This population can be transformed into champions if the will power in the government is awakened
 lekin sabase bada sawaal yah he ki kya aisa hamaare desh main ho saktaa he? main is baat ko lekar sahamaa hua hum ki mujhe isaki sambhaavna dhoomil najar aa rahi he
 International athletes have marginalized India
 ham pehle se hi aisa sun rahe hai ki akhil bhartiya congress cameti kaa 2 november ko honevaala satr talkatoraa boxing stadium main yojit kiya jayega
 This is a very shameful thing for power
 desh main khelon ke liye vishwastareey buniyadi dhaancha khadaa karne main ykardaataaon ke hajaaron karod rupye kharch hue hai
 It will be a great tragedy for the country, if our politicians take possession of these facilities
 talkatoraa boxron ke liye banaaya gaya he or iskaa istemaal sirf boxron ko hi karne dena chahie
 Leaders must find a separate place to realize their political power
 sach poocha jaae to agar kaamanwealth games ko kaamyaab qaraar diya jaataa he, to iskaa shrey hamaare khiladiyon ke pradarshan ko dena hoga
 Just before the start of the Games, every Indian's head bowed with shame when there were frequent reports of mismanagement and negligence in the event
 iske liye pradhanmantri se lekar ve sabhi jimmedaar hai, jinhone pehle itnaa bhrashtachar failaane kii chhot di
 What was the Prime Minister doing when Suresh Kalmadi and his family were hanging on each other

 The expenses continued to increase till the end
 yah jaanate hue ki sarkaar ke paas in kharchon ko vahan karne ke alaava koi doosraa chaara nahin he, kyonki khel najadik aate ja rahe the
 The Prime Minister has constituted a committee under the chairmanship of former Comptroller and Auditor General VK Shunglu to investigate the fraud in the event of Commonwealth Games
 yah cameti tab zyada kargar nahin ho sakegi, agar yah mahaj bali kaa bakra hi khoj nikaalane kaa kaam kare
 Kalmadi and Bhanot no longer appear on the TV screen
 inpar jaanch kaa shikanja kasata ja rahaa he
 But they are not alone responsible for making the country suffer
 isaki jaden kaaphi gahari hai
 Even people close to the Prime Minister are under suspicion
 pradhanmantri or sonia gandhi ne khiladiyon ke sammaan samaaroh main suresh kalmari or shila dikshit ko nyotaa nahin bheja
 They were ignored, but that alone is not enough
 desh ko sharmasaar hone kaa mauka dene vaale kaamanwealth ke khalnaayakon ko sajaa di jaani chahie or inhen salaakhon ke peeche daalaa janaa chahie
 Chief Minister Sheila Dixit is already in talks to host the Olympics
 yah bura vichaar nahin ho saktaa
 If the accountability is fixed, the corrupt people are put in jail, the right lessons are learned properly, then any big sporting event will get the support of the people of the country
 janata is tarah ke aayojanon ko netaaon dwaara apni jeb garm ke karne maukey ke rup main dekhati-samajhati ai he
 Gagan Narang, who won 4 gold medals alone in the Commonwealth, made a big point in gestures
 unhone kaha ki padak jeetne ke baad jab ve stadium chhod rahe the, to unhen yah bhay sata rahaa tha ki khelon ke samaapan ke ek hafte baad janata keval ghotaale kii baton ko hi yaad rakhegi or khiladiyon kii kamyaabiyon ko bhula degi
 But this is not acceptable to the countrymen
 khiladiyon ko protsaahan milanaa chahie, taaki ye gaurav kii chamak har ore bikher saken
 Also, whoever forced the country to look down, a case should be registered
 ek ke bina mahaj doosraa upaay kisi deshadroh se kam nahin hoga

 Dry run of Grand Alliance before 2019? After this meeting, there is speculation whether the opposition will field its candidate in the presidential election?

 Or will the JDU join the Congress-led grand alliance

 is tarah kul vot 10 lakh 93 hajaar 654 hai or jeet ke liye aadhe se ek zyada yani 5 lakh 46 hajaar 828 vot chahie
 What is the status of NDA? At present, NDA has 339 mps in Lok Sabha and 74 mps in Rajya Sabha
 chunki manonith saansad raashtrapati chunaav main vot nahin dete isliye loksabhaa ke 337 saansad or rajyasabha ke 70 saansad vot denge
 The value of the vote of an MP is 708
 Accordingly, the NDA has 2 lakh 38 thousand 596 votes in the Lok Sabha and the NDA has 49 thousand 560 votes in the Rajya Sabha
 yani endie ke saansadon ke 2 lakh 88 hajaar 156 vot hue
 Apart from this, there will be votes from the assembly
