 Joshi sir knew this
 un dinon bhi likhane-padhane kaa kaaphi chaska lag gaya tha
 Because of this, sometimes even studies would be left behind
 joshi sar kii class main bhi kabhi-kabhi apane main khoyaa-khoyaa-sa rahata
 He would often take a sweet pinch of it
 par kabhi unhone karier ke naam par sahitya padhane yaa likhane se hatotsahit kiya ho, yaad nahin padataa
 Sometimes smilingly also used to say that "look brother, always those who leave the rut and walk, only they are able to do anything in life
 par haan paresh, ek baat jarur dhyaan rakhana
 He should leave the rut and have the courage to make new leaks and have the ability to face the biggest problems for him
 "shaayad yah joshi sar ke aashirwad kaa hi fal tha ki jindagi main khub thokaren khain, par kabhi haara nahin
 Even deliberately kept calling plagues, come and kill me! a friend would say, "paresh is mad, don't know who is drunk! Who puts a life at stake like this?" But i was convinced that i am a disciple of Joshi sir, no one can spoil me
 kitne hi dukh yaa museebataan aaen, main haarunga nahin
 And the same thing always saved us from the biggest difficulties
 yani yah jo apane guru prannath joshi par vishwaas tha, vahi baad main khud par vishwaas kii neenv banataa chalaa gaya
 2 However, it is also true that when we read from him, in the ninth-tenth position - i was so afraid of him that often the wind would go bad
 maaraa unhone kabhi nahin- kabhi haath tak nahin chuaayaa, par unke krodh se badhkar yatnaa hamaare liye kuch na thi
 It is a matter of fact that despite all this, we also loved him the most
 yon to hamaare kasbe ke us sabase achche skool, adarsh vidyabhavan main ek se ek achche adhyaaapak the, par ham mureed the to sirf joshi sar ke
 Probably because more teachers only taught
 or acha hi padhaate the
 But Joshi was just as obsessed with teaching in sir
 unka padhaanaa paathya pustakon se shuru hokar jaldi hi jindagi kii khuli kitaab tak pahunchataa tha
 And this was such a place, except guide, there was no one in our town at that time to tell, listen or communicate anything
 ek maje kii baat yah he ki puri class ko ve jaise har ghadi alert rakhte
 It is believed that when they are in class and teaching, someone comes to Jamuhai
 joshi sar kaa padhaate hue achaanak peeche gardan ghumaakar sawaal poochne kaa andaaj itnaa pyaara tha ki ham sabamein ekaek bijli-si daud jaati or jawaab dene ke liye acchhee-khaasi hode shuru ho jaati
 Because they were not only asking questions, but who used to answer in whatever manner, they also kept a close watch on it
 agar kahin kuch gadabad hota to fouran tokate or puri class ke aage acha-khaasaa majaak banataa
 And if the answer was good, i would have been so appreciative that, oh, we were blessed to be born in this world and come to Adarsh vidya Bhavan and read from Joshi sir maano ham isiilie skool aate hai ki joshi sar puuchhen to jhat chaukanne hokar unke sawaal kaa makul jawaab de saken
 The mind becomes a garden! Aha, Joshi sir praised him, so what is left to get good in life? And he was not among those who were satisfied by asking each one or two
 ek-ek karke har chaatr ko khadaa karte jate or kabhi-kabhi to puri kii puri class ko khadaa kar dete
 In the end, i and Subodh would remain, and we would stare at Joshi's head with electric vigil when he would ask and we would tell
 or jab tak number aata, dil kii dhadakanen itani bad chuki hotin ki lagata- bas, abhi ham behosh hokar jameen par aa girenge
 Many times, i and Subodh used to prepare from home so much as to go to an international seminar
 khud hi joshi sar banakar apane aapse sawaalon kii jhadi laga dete
 Again and again the question erupts from within - tell me, if Joshi sir asked this, what answer would you give? Our subjects were full eight, but the truth is that the subject was one for us - English
 baaki subject pard lete the, bas
 But english We used to put lot in it, because this was the subject of Joshi sir
 itnaa sakht compitishan
 
 
 That very often would become the pinnacle of all-day success for us! Subodh was quite witty compared to a very emotional and snappy person like me and sometimes used to jokingly say, "yaar Paresh, kuch humse joshi sir kya hai i have been thinking this morning that i do not know what is the matter that there are other classes, but we probably come to school only for Joshi sir's period
 tumhen aisa nahin lagata paresh
 
 
 ? "" Yes, that's right
 " kehete-kehete main itnaa hansaa, itnaa hansaa ki jaise bheetar se hansee kaa koi tabadatod jharnaa foot padaa ho
 Subodh said exactly that
 hamaari sachmuch diwaanon vaali haalat thi
 Joshi sir is happy with us, this was the biggest reason for us being happy and living
 unki khushi ke liye ham khushi-khushi jaan dene ko taiyaar rahete! ise deewangi na kahen to kya kahen?aise joshi sar bhi kabhi jaayenge, or yah duniya unke bagaiyr bhi hogi, kabhi sochaa nahin tha
 
 
 
 or aaj bhi ve din patangon kii tarah meri aankhon main mandra rahe hai, jab main or subodh unke ghar padhane jaaya karte the
 Can you ever forget to sit near them like a child? However, when we got engaged on jobs, sometimes when they came here to meet, even with a little snout, they would say, "brother, what shall i say now? You have learned a lot now
" sochoge ki yah buddha bekaar kii pen-pen kar rahaa he or hamen lihaajadari main sunanaa pad rahaa he
 Anyway, what do i have to tell you now? You will teach the opposite of what is happening in today's world
 phir meri ore ishaara karke kehete, or paresh, tumhaara to acha-khaasaa bada naam he, lekhak-patrkaar ho
 Heard, you have got enough name zyada to nahin, par bich-bich main kuch patrikas dekhtaa-padhata hoon, to bada garv hota he ki meraa student itnaa aage pahunch gaya
 "I would become water after listening
 rundhe gale se kahata, "sar, zyada khochadi karenge to main uthakar chalaa jaaounga
 "joshi started smiling at this
 haalaanki pichhali dfa aisa hi prasang chalaa or main kuch zyada hi ruaansa ho gaya, to joshi sar ne aage badhkar pyaar se mujhe chaati se laga liya tha
 My eyes were wet at that time
 3prannath joshi
 
 
 ! These were not just words for us, they were really something more than life
 dil main gaharaa jajba or josh bhar dene vaale shabd
 That is why 'our English teacher Prannath Joshi' - just saying it does not help
 sach puuchhie to ve kuch or hi the
 Most different and so big
 
 
 ki unhen chhu paanaa lagbhag asambhav tha
 They were bigger than our biggest ideals
 haan thik, ve adhyaaapak the
 But such a teacher whose ideal and imaginary picture is always in our heart
 shaayad isiilie ek vaakya main unke bare main bataanaa ho to main kahana pasand karunga ki puri duniya main prannath joshi to sirf ek prannath joshi hi ho sakate the! un jaisaa koi doosraa shaks bana paanaa shaayad khud ishwar ke liye bhi sambhav na ho
 We would never have understood many things if Joshi had not gone to Sir's class
 masalan, padhaanaa kya cheez he! mujhase yaa subodh se pucho to ham kahenge ki padhaanaa vah hota he, jo joshi sar kii class main ham mahasoos kiya karte the jab ve padhaa rahe hote the
 i used to get drowned when i taught
 or aise naatakeey andaaj main padhaate the ki puri class par unka jaadu tari ho jaataa tha
 Many times, we used to be left stunned by seeing their postures in class
 ekadam chitra-likhit
 His taught text 'uncle Pauser Hangs a Picture' is still remembered
 or ‘ab bhi’ kyon kah rahaa hoon? isliye ki ise to janam-jindagi tak bhul paanaa mere bas kii baat nahin he
 Oops, how did he dance and teach the whole class how Uncle Pauser climbs on a stool to hang the picture and then what the spectacles are
 aise unhone diwaar par keel rakhi, aise kasakar chalaaya hathaudaa ki diwaar kaa plasters tak ukhdakar dur ja gira or phir usee ke saath hi ankal poger gire dha-dahoss
 
 
 M! Drama in Drama in Drama
 
 
 tauba-tauba!joshi sar ke is naatak kii khaasiyat yah ki unhone sirf aawaaj kii dher-dher-si bhangimaaon kaa sahaara liya tha or usee se drishy par drishy nirmit hote jate the
 i am still amazed and shocked by the memory of all that what really happened! And that too in Adarsh vidyabhavan's tutelary but somewhat docile environment - that a dramatic lesson was taught with its actual and complete drama as if you are sitting in Mandi House, not in class form! While teaching, he would get to hear his harsh criticisms and sarcasm about his country, society and sometimes even Adarsh vidya Bhavan
 bilkul usee andaaj main jaise aap mandihouse main koi tikhaa vyangyatmak naatak dekh rahe hon, jisamen shuru se ant tak bheeshan abrdity kii khuraaq
 
 
 One of the specialties of Joshi sir was that he was a man of great size
 hameshaa safed bedaag dhoti-kurte main lakadak-lakadak najar aate
 Like half a foot above the ground
 or ve lagbhag har cheez ke aalochak the
 We were astonished and apprehensive at the manner in which he used to criticize the color of our school itself, as well as some terrorized and apprehensive that all these things were made by the great powerful principal of Adarsh vidyabhavan
 balawantdev makhija tak pahunchengi, to na jane kya anarth ho jayega! lekin joshi sar ko baat kehete hue kabhi daayen-baayein dekhte kii jarurat nahin padi
 There is another incident related to Joshi sir which i have not been able to forget till date and i will probably never forget in this life
 hua yah ki ek dfa unhone class main grammer kaa paath padhaayaa or usee main se koi kaam sab bacchon ko diya tha, ghar se karke laane ke liye
 We children used to do their work first, because their anger and even more their speeches scared them
 sach pucho to kabhi-kabhi ve hamen joint lagate the
 
 
 Giant monster! So how could they be forgotten? But it happened this time that he gave homework, then there were long holidays
 lihaaja class main kisi ko bhi yaad nahin rahaa
 When we came to class after the holidays, Joshi ji asked about work
 puri class main ikkaa-dukka ko chhodkar kisi ne homework nahin kiya tha, lihaaja unka gussa saatven aasmaan par ja pahunchaa or unhone puri class ko ‘murga’ banane kaa aadesh de diya
 All shocked! Everyone knew that Joshi Ji said that there is a line of stone
 ise maane bagaiyr koi chaara nahin
 It may also be that they increase the punishment in anger on the grain
 to ek-ek kar sabhi bachche saamne aate gaye or murga banate gaye
 i remained very respectful to Joshi, but i felt bad for being a cock
 sochataa tha ki ishwar ne jab acha-khaasaa banda banaaya he, to mujhe murga banane kaa haq to kisi ko nahin he- joshi sar ko bhi nahin, chaahe ve kitne hi aadarneey kyon na hon
 However, i did not become a rooster
 uthhke baar-baar kehane par bhi nahin bana
 Joshi sir threatened very much
 class se fouran nikal jane or hafte bhar tak class main na aane ko kaha
 i was not ready on this either
 unki harek dhamkee or gussell vachanon kaa jawaab mere paas sirf yahi tha ki, "sar, aap maar lijie
 No matter how much you kill, i will not kiss at all
 par main murga nahin banunga
 "A period went out in this dizzy
 joshi sar kabhi shant hokar mujhe samajhaate ki "dekho paresh, murga to tumhen bananaa padegaa
 There is no choice without this
 balki ho saktaa he, meri sajaa or bad jaae
 So it is good to accept it already
 "bich-bich main gusse main aakar daantne lagate
 Finally the bell rang, so i had some rest
 joshi sar class se jane lage to unhone nirnaayak swar main kaha, "dekho paresh, tumhaari vajah se itane saare students kaa puraa period kharaab ho gaya
 You have done a lot of damage to the whole class
 ab agle period main yaa to meri class main aana mat, yaa phir period shuru hote hi yahan aakar murga ban janaa
 Think well what you have to do, otherwise i will have to take strict steps
 tum class ke sabase achche student ho or tum khud jaanate ho, main tumhen kitna pyaar karata hoon
 Disciplin is Disiplin
 yahan main koi samjhauta nahin kar saktaa
 If i leave you today, tomorrow the other children of the class will also say the same
 so you dyside, meri class main baithna he yaa nahin?"sunakar meraa sir chakra gaya
 i was thinking that if the period was over then i got rid of this problem
 isiilie itani der se ishwar se prarthana kar rahaa tha ki "he bhagwaan jaldi se jaldi ghanta bajwa do, taaki is afat se bachuun
 "and now even if the bell rings, this disaster! 
 
 uf, maare gaye gulfam!class ke bachche jo ekadam shuru main hi bas ek-ek, aadha-aadha minute murga banakar is afat se pind chhudaa chuke the, meri ore aise dayaa-bhav se dekh rahe the ki jaise halaal ke liye bakra le jaaya ja rahaa ho
 However, there were two or three girls in the class who were naturally liberated from this punishment, looking at me with a very appreciative view
 or isse sach hi meraa hausala kuch bad gaya tha
 Particularly, it was a little different to see Saunli Salotri Devki, the smartest of the three girls
 maine mahasoos kiya ki ve nigahen mujhase kah rahi hai, "date raho paresh, date rahanaa
 You are right, perfect
 isliye bilkul haar mat maananaa, tumhen meri kasam!"uske baad ek-ek karke kai period aae, gaye
 i had no awareness
 main to jaise keelit kar diya gaya houn! meraa sara dhyaan to us katl kii ghadi par tha jo angreji ke agle period yani aathven period main aane vaali thi
 Was there any way that could save me from the great disaster? But no, the trouble that is going to come, it only comes and stays
 use bhala koun roak paaya he? usase bachane kaa koi rasta nahin tha, sivaay iske joshi sar se takaraakar apane aap ko sahi sabit karuun
 But could i confront Joshi sir? My feet were shivering, while inside the mind was saying, "you are right Paresh, you are right
 bhala tumhen murga banane kii kya jarurat?"isi sur main sur milakar maine apane aap se kaha, "joshi sar ko sajaa deni he to daant len, yaa phir chaahe jitna maaren, par murga
 
 
 The No, no, this is wrong, stupid, injustice
 
 
 ! or anyaay to anyaay he, bhale hi use karne vaale hamaare aadarneey joshi sar hi kyon na hon!"ek ore himmat, duusari ore pasti
 Stir trembling in a crust
 ajab haalat thi
 Sweat was left due to nervousness
 jabaan taalu se chipak gai thi or hont suukh gaye the
 Hi, what is going to happen now ?
 
 
 aage kya hoga paresh?yon jaise-taise ram-ram karke aathvaan period shuru hua
 My upper breath up, down down
 dar ke maare praan nikle ja rahe the ki pataa nahin kya ho!joshi sar ne class main aate hi apni usee nirmam tatasthta se poocha, "haan to paresh, tumne kya sochaa
 
 
 ? "I wanted to answer, but the lips were like papadia! Rather, the stubbornness and strength in the voice while speaking in the morning class of Joshi sir was no more
 maine dekha, ek mari hui-si aawaaj mere munh se nikali, "sar, aap maar lijie jitna bhi chahen, par
 
 ?"par kya
 
 
 The Tell me clearly whether you will become a rooster or not? i do not want to hear anything else
 " joshi sar ne ekaek gusse main aakar kaha
 My wind then started to go round, but i somehow managed to maintain courage
 "sar, main murga to nahin banunga, par aap maar lijie
 Saying this, i put my hands forward
 puri class yah naatak saans rokkar dekh rahi thi, jo ab clymex par pahunchaa hi jaataa tha
 "look, you are not mine, you are wasting the time of all the children of the class Paresh
 chaahe puraa saal isi tarah nikal jaae, par
 
 
 You will get punishment and you will have to become cock
 varanaa main padhaaunga nahin
 Think how much loss the whole class will have because of you
 ""sar, aap maar lijie
 "my same take
 maine phir se haath aage badha diya
 My hand was trembling
 vaaki agar ek ke baad ek bees danda bhi pad jate, to bhi main uf na karata
 But how do i become a cock, while i do not feel like becoming a cock? And then, did i not understand the courage and appreciation of the dark-eyed Devaki who looked at me? Was in ninth, but understood that when a girl looks at someone like this, then everything should be forgotten and played on life
 par
 
 
 So i did not become such a cock
 joshi sar ne bahut dar dikhaaya, gusse ke maare unki bhi haalat kharaab thi
 For so long, he was constantly speaking, sometimes in anger, sometimes with love
 bich-bich main psychological feare bhi
 
 
 
 !apane tarkash ke saare teen ve chalaa chuke the
 But what would you do! He used to love me a lot
 lihaaja ek bich kaa rasta unhone nikaala
 He said, "okay, that's all you say is just a way
 
 
 
 If the children of the class will say leave Paresh, then i will leave
 ""oh, ishwar kaa lakh-lakh dhanyavad! he ishwar, tu kitna dayaalu he, kitna
 
 
 How important! "their point was not yet complete, that the whole class screamed together," Leave it sir, leave it
 
 
 chhod dijie!"or yon der se nyaayalay main lambit jeet or haar hi nahin, marane or jeene kaa maamla bamushkil khatm hua
 Although still badly 'innermost'
 
 
 thar-thar’ ho rahi thi
 Like eyes that want to rise from tears and tears are not coming out! Very strange condition
 ∙∙khayr, us din puri chuttee hone par skool se niklaa, to main class ke saare bacchon kaa ‘hero’ ban chukaa tha, kyonki ek bachche ne pehali baar kisi nachiketa kii tarah, apni vinamrata se joshi sar jaise robile or sakht mizaaj vaale adhyaaapak par vijay pai thi
 
 
 And say that a right issue was overcome
 yah vijay apane us pyaare adhyaaapak par thi, jise ham ji-jaan se chaahate the, or jiskaa gussa hamen yamraj se kam bhayanak nahin lagata tha!4haalaanki joshi sar hameshaa aise hi nahin rahe, badale
 And when my younger brother Attu arrived in his class after three years, his mood had changed a lot
 ve kahin adhik komal or snehil lagane lage the
 The strictness of punishing students also decreased
 haalaanki shishyon ko padhaate hue apana sab kaa sab de dene kii besabri waisi hi thi or vah unamem ant tak rahi!shaayad isliye ki koi stodand unke liye khaali ek role number nahin tha! har kisi ko ve bheetar-baahar se jaanate the or koshish karte the ki ve sirf padhaayen hi nahin, balki uske vyaktitv ko jitna sanvaar sakate hai, sanvaaren
 And his love for me was Mamatalu type from the very beginning
 unki class main meraa pehla hi din tha, jab unke sawaal kaa badhiya angreji main jawaab dene par unki nigahen mere chehre par tang gayi
 He asked a few chuckles, "paresh, are you an Anglo Indian?" "no sir
 " maine chaunkkar kaha
 "but you know English
 " itani pyaar bhari najaron se dekhte hue unhone kaha tha ki main aaj tak use bhuulaa nahin hoon
 And then some such words of appreciation were heard dozens of times
 ve tarif karte the to keval kuch shabd hi nahin kehete the, balki unke puure vyaktitv se ek alag tarah kii khushi footati thi jo maine unke alaava kahin or nahin dekhi
 And if he ever missed, he would take water before the whole class, "hey, what happened to you Paresh? You couldn't even answer such a minor question, it is a matter of great shame
 " sunakar lagata, jaise dharti fat jaae or main usamen samaa jaaon!asal main yahi unka dhang tha kisi ke dil main utarane kaa
 It was impossible to forget them and what they said, as they were consented to everything
 attu bataa rahaa tha, "joshi sar kii class main jane par pehle hi din unhen pataa chal gaya tha ki main aapkaa bhai hoon
 And as soon as i told you, Sir, i am Paresh's younger brother, love clouded his eyes
 cheharaa kuch is kadar sneh se labalab tha ki ek minute tak to ve kuch bol hi nahin paae
 Then asked very emotionally, well, how is Paresh
 
 
 ? thik he na! mujhe kabhi yaad karata he ki nahin? use kahana, kabhi mujhase milane aae
 Has he forgotten me? 
 
 or phir pataa nahin kitni der tak puri class ko bataate rahe, ki paresh aisa brilient or pyaara student tha unka jise ve kabhi bhul nahin paayenge
 "from the same day Attu became his highest affection in class
 uski ek-ek baat kaa ve khyal rakhte
 If he had made a mistake, he would have explained it with love kabhi-kabhi halaki daant bhi laga dete ki "mehnat kiya karo amit
 You should know that you are Paresh's brother
 
 
 
 Yes, if any problem comes, ask not one, ten times
 par aisa mat karnaa ki mujhe tumhen daantna pade
 Don't drown Paresh's name somewhere
 mind it, meraa sabase pyaara student tha vah
 "there were many teachers in our school who used to teach, but those who used to teach were a disaster
 isliye period khatm hone se pehle hi ve register sanbhaalkar baith jate the ki kab ghanta baje or ve agali class kaa routine shuru karen
 But teaching for Joshi sir was like an addiction
 unhen isamen vaaki majaa aata tha or mujhe lagata he, agar unhen lagaataar choubees ghante padhaanaa padhata, to bhi ve thakte nahin
 In class, it would often happen that the hour went by, but Joshi sir is not so engrossed in interpreting a poem-story in a dramatic way or telling any particular role of a character
 tab hamen yaad dilaanaa padataa tha ki sar, period khatm ho gaya he or ve ‘sori’ kahkar apana vichaar-pravaah bich main rokte or shaayad anichhaa se class chhodkar jate
 Even when he came close to the examinations, he started calling us home on Sunday so that Grammar could write the necessary notes
 or unke saare puraane studends bataate the ki unke ye nots to shuddh sona hai, sona jisamen unke puure gyaan kaa nichod he
 Especially for direct-indirect, they cannot get good guidance from anywhere! "everyone makes mistakes here, but you are my student, i would like none of you to make this mistake
 " padhaate hue bich-bich main joshi sar ke munh se sunate to bahut acha lagata tha
 "english Grammar
 
 
 ! yaad rakho, yah tumhaare liye vardaan he inglish main distinction marks laane ke liye
 You will get numbers from this only
 jaise ganit main sawaal sahi he to puure number milte hai, aise hi agar dhyaan se mere ye nots pard lo to kahin maar nahin khaaoge
 "there was no exaggeration," claimed Joshi sir
 unke chaatro ke kai puraane batch isaki gavaahi de sakate the
 ∙∙ This was the reason why i and Subodh used to run and reach him even when there were Preparation Leaves before high school papers
 or aakhri din jab ve paper se sambandhit sab kuch bataa chuke, to unki aankhon main bas ek guzarish thi, "khub mehnat karo
 Do not disappoint your Joshi sir
 yaad rakhana, tum donon meri do ankhen ho
 "the same day he told," Look, for the first time i am telling you this secret
 vah ye ki maine khud principal makhija sahab se bahut jid karke unase tum logon kii tenth kii class maangi thi
 They did not defer to me
 isiilie ab tumse mujhe itani ummiden hai
 "and then it came to know that for years Joshi sir was not being given classes without class x and XII
 
 
 ki ye thoro study karaate hai to bacchon ke zyada number nahin aa paayenge
 But for our class, Joshi sir insisted that you give me a class of Tanth this time
 is baar inglish main main kam se kam do distinction aapako doongaa!""kya ! distinction inglish main
 
 
 The This has not happened till date
 " mackhicat moonchhon vaale golmatol principal makhija hairaan the
 "but what has never happened, it also happens sometimes
 " joshi sar hanse
 There was so much determination and confidence in his laughter that Principal Makhija had to obey him and he said 'yes'
 haalaanki joshi sar ke liye yah kitna bada chalange rahaa hoga, iskaa andaja ab hamen ho rahaa tha!hamane unke pair chhukar vidaa lee
 Then the day before the English paper was there, i and Subodh went to his house even a day before that
 ham donon kaa kandhaa thapthapaakar unhone kaha, "mujhe yakeen he, tum donon hi kuch na kuch kamaal is baar karoge
 You do not need to be afraid of anyone
 agar mushkil se mushkil parchaa aa jaae, to bhi koi tumhen angreji main distinction laane se nahin roak saktaa
 After all, you are my most deserving student! ”he had laid the weight of such high hopes on our heads that our feet were shivering while raising him
 par jab hiskool kaa rigelt aayaa to vah sapana hakeekat ban chukaa tha, jisaki kalpana karte bhi ham darate the
 For the first time that year, two distractions were made in English and our school really set a new record
 subodh or main puure skool main charchit ho gaye the
 5 Thus Joshi became old as he taught
 ritair hokar bhi ve ritair kahan hue the? unke ghar padhane vaale chaatro kaa taanta pehle kii tarah hi laga rahata or ve khub maje main padhaate
 The teachers accompanying him were sitting with educational shops and Joshi sir was flowing the river of knowledge
 koi bhi anjali bhar-bharkar uskaa jal le saktaa tha
 However, his family members, especially the father who was a retired government officer, were not happy with all this
 "are praan, logon ne tution kar-karke haweliyaan khadi kar leen, or tum
 
 
 ! That's it, this small house is not with you
 " ek baar pita unase milane aae to apni nakhushi unhone jaahir kar di
 Joshi sir laughed and said, "no, father, where is the small one? That's enough for us
" isse bada ho to koun sanbhaalega?"or sach to yah he ki unka vah chota-sa ghar bhi har vakt kitabon se anta rahata
 Mrs
 Joshi — Joshi sir, who was sometimes called Damoyanti or sometimes lovingly called Dammo — was not very well educated, but she was also fortunately very affectionate and did not tease me at times with students like us
 kai baar ve bhi vahiin aakar baith jaatin
 We and Joshi used to listen to Sir's words and smile
 sach to yah he ki hamane bahut-se ghar dekhe, par prem se bana ghar bhi koi ho saktaa he, yah ahsaas to bas joshi sar ke ghar jane par hi hota tha
 Joshi sir's son Sukant was here in America for years
 usne elahabaad se ejineering kii or koi acchhee job use mili
 The company sent her to the US for five years and then by marrying the girl of her choice there, she decided to settle in the US
 rah gaye sirf pati-patni
 
 
 That is Joshi sir and Mrs Joshi
 bheetar tak saralata or prem se bhide hue adarsh hindustani danpati
 Many a times we think, “we take so much time at home with Joshi sir
 kahin isse misses joshi pareshaan na hoti hon?" par ve apane pati or unki pyaari-si sanak ko jaanati thim or yah bhi ki isi se ve jinda hai
 That is why Sukant may have called him to America for twenty times, but he did not go
 misses damayanti joshi bhi is maamle main joshi sar se kuch kam na thim
 Mrs
 Joshi went through a heart attack some three years ago
 unke jane ke baad pehali baar joshi sar hamen thode kamjor or toote hue-se lage
 He was going somewhere alone
 haalaanki unki himmat or jivan-lay tuuti nahin thi
 i have never seen him cursing the current time or the new generation like other retired people
 kaha karte the, "har daur main samay apana mizaaj khud tay karata he
 Yes, we are old people, so we cannot leave our way
 " is umr main bhi saare kaam khud karke unhen khushi milti thi
 Son Sukant's insistence, "papa, you should hire a servant for twenty-four hours
 paise kii bilkul chintaa mat kiijie
 i will pay all the expenses " is par joshi sar kaa jawaab ki "betaa, subah se raat tak dhire-dhire hi sahi, saare kaam karata hoon to gaadi chal rahi he
 Once seated, i will remain seated again
 tab koi naukar kuch nahin kar paaegaa
 And how much will you do while sitting in America? ”meanwhile, son Sukant's request to come to America continued to grow
 par joshi sar kii jid apni jagah
 All the students, who were stubbornly beaten by him, used to keep track of his condition every day
 unamem bank manager se lekar secretary jaise unche ohadon par baithe hue log bhi the, jo bade garv se bataate ki ham joshi sar ke student hai
 And when his students came to meet him, Joshi Sir's happiness would break the dam
 baaten karte hue ekadam jawan ho jate, jaise umr ke pahaad ko utaar phenkaa he
 6 Just a year ago, me and Subodh went to meet him
 joshi sar itane khush hue ki khushi unke bheetar-baahar se foot rahi thi
 "how are you guys?" He asked with shaking lips
 der tak ghar-parivaar ke bare main poochhate rahe
 Then he himself was about to get up to make tea, that we persuaded him with great difficulty that i and Subodh would make tea together
 thodi der baad chaay kaa pyaalaa unke aage rakhte hue maine kaha, "sar, ham bhi to aapke bete hai
 "hearing this, his eyes got a little wet
 "tum log bahut achche ho, varanaa aajkal koun yaad karata he kise?" kehete hue joshi sar kaa swar bhig gaya tha
 "no sir, don't say that
 aapane hamen banaaya he
 You have created our personality with your own hands, so that no wrong has ever happened to us and never we have bowed down to anyone
 " subodh ne kaha
 i am not even told that
 pataa nahin kya kahana chahta tha? galaa rundh gaya! honton se koi bol niklaa hi nahin
 "after getting into engineering, i missed that English you insisted on, but Joshi sir, i still write the best English there today!" Subodh said that there was a strange humidity on his face
 yah aatmadaya nahin, apane bhare-puure hone or tuutakar jeene kaa ahsaas tha
 i remembered Joshi sir saying years ago, "look Paresh, i have given you such a strong and strong base that you don't need to bow to anyone
" yah kabhi mat bhoolanaa ki tum mere student ho
 "I reminded them and started laughing
 ek kamjor-si hansee, lekin mithaas se pagi hui
 But the next moment, i do not know how i remembered the incident of not becoming the cock of the ninth position
 maine thitholi kii, "or haan sar, mujhe murga banane kii bhi jarurat nahin he- bhale hi mujhe aapke yaa phir kisi or ke aage satyagrah karnaa pade!"sunakar ve us durbalata kii haalat main bhi khilakhilaakar hans pade the
 Then some paused and said, "paresh, to be honest, from that day onwards a different image of yours has formed in my mind
 tumne dekha nahin ki pandrah minute main puri class murga bani
 Everyone became cocky and sat on their seats
 yahan tak ki subodh bhi
 But the rest of that day's entire period and the next period were spent with you
 usee din main samaj gaya tha, tumhaari jindagi kin raaston par chalegi
 And today i am telling you that day i gave up on you
 tum chote the, par kuch aisi baat thi tumme ki mujhe haarana padaa
 He is still in you and i would like to always be there
 "chalate hue maine or subodh ne pair chhue, to unhone aashirwad diya, "khush raho or jivan main bahut bade kaam karo
 
 
 ! "then called Subodh by gesture and said," Look, Subodh, i know, you will all be looked after
 par mujhe paresh kii ab bhi kabhi-kabhi chintaa hoti he
 If he ever gets in trouble, you should take care of him
 " or subodh kaa haath mere kandhe par kas gaya tha
 It was so accidental that i was shocked
 laga, khud ko nahin roka, to abhi foot-footkar rone lagoonga
 When we got out by bowing to him, when coming out and starting the car, Subodh had said, "my mind says Paresh, there is not much time now
 zyada se zyada shaayad saal-chah maheene
 They were not seeing how their hands were shivering while drinking tea! ”he used to say, his eyes were full, including mine
 ∙∙or aaj
 
 
 ! Let me call the same comprehension and inform me on the phone that our beloved and most wonderful and wonderful Joshi sir is no more in the world - this responsibility is on me
 lekin kaise kahoon, kaise ki subodh, hamaare joshi sar ab nahin rahe? shabd mere gale se niklenge?maine phone kaa choga uthaa liya he, par haath ab bhi kaanp rahe hai- thar-thar

 The Rail Budget presented in Parliament in February this year may be the last
 aisa hua to suresh prabhu rail bajet pesh karne vaale aakhri rail mantri ho jaaenge
 The NITI Aayog has recommended abolition of the railway budget in one of its reports
 niti ayog kii rail bajet ko khatm kii sifarishdarasal ayog ne report main kaha he ki alag se rail bajet kii jarurat nahin he
 It can be included in the general budget itself
 kyonkinai trainen jarurat ke mutabikbich main bhi chalaai ja sakati he or kiraaya tay karne ke liye sansad par nirbhar rahane kii jarurat nahin
 The Commission has submitted its report to the PMO and the PMO has forwarded it to the Railway Board
 railway board isapar sahmati jaahir kar detaa he to kareeb 100 saal se chali aa rahi is parampara kaa ant ho jayega
 Report sent to PMO The Policy Commission in its report sent to the Prime Minister's Office has said that the railway budget has become a political platform which has had an additional impact on Indian Railways
 rail bajet khatm hone par sarkaar main naukarshahi or raajnneetik prakriya main kami aegi, jisase railway ko behatar banane main madad milegi, kyonki vot bank ke liye loklubhawan ghoshnaaen samaapt ho jaaengi
 a report on changing the health of the Railways has been prepared by Niti Aayog member Bivek Debroy, who has already prepared a report on the metamorphosis of the railways
 sutara bataate hai ki report main kaha gaya he ki alag rail bajet pesh karne kii maujuuda vyavastha ko khatm karne se rail sudhaar kii disha main acha sandesh jayega
 It may be noted that there has been uproar in the past on a report of the Debroy Committee, in which the privatization of the railway was recommended
 philhal railway main bajet ke 10 bhagrailvay ke aalaa aadhikari bataate hai ki ab tak rail bajet ke avasar kaa istemaal kiraye main vruddhi yaa kami ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he
 But the reality is that Parliament's approval is not necessary for the increase in Kirel fares, so it is not necessary to present the railway budget separately
 sutron kii maane to philhal railway bajet ke das pramukh bhaag hote hai jisamen se maatr do ko hi sansad kii manjuuri kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, ye do bhaag pichley vitt varsh kaa vittiya pradarshan or bajtiy varsh ke liye prastaavit rajasav or vyay hai
 In this way both of these can be included in the general budget as is the case with other ministries
 haalanki railway kaa ection plan banane, vijan yojanaayen taiyaar karne or outkam dastavej taiyaar karne kaa kaam rail mantralay ke paas hi rahegaa

 isaki behtareen misaal hai utubar bhuwan balm jinke channel ke dedh karod se adhik sabsakribar hai or unke har video ko lakhon vyuj milte hai
 Bam's channel enjoys the 218th ranking worldwide and is also among the world's most watched channels
 or kamai? kisi bhi bollywood celebrity se kam nahin
 According to media reports, Balm's annual earnings are in crores of rupees
 bhuwan balm yun hi mashhoor nahin hue
 There are many fun in them
 ve apane video main titu mamaa or janaki ji se lekar banchodas tak kii kai bhoomikaayen nibhaate hai or khud hi shoot karte hai
 This sometimes leads to confusion in his audience, in which he enjoys a lot
 ve kehete hai, ''mere kirdaar saamaanya logon ke hi atireki sanskaran hai
 Many times people do not understand that i have played all the characters
 agar ve mujhe titu mamaa ke rup main sambodhit karte hai, to yahi sahi
 However, Bam has a keen interest in music and has also performed his talent through several forums, but youtube became the only way to become famous
 tab johny liver, kadar khan or govinda se prerit balm kaa ek vyangyatmak video, pakistan, bangladesh or nepal main viral ho gaya or utyub ke ek jane-pahachaane naam ke rup main unki pahchaan banane kii shuruyaat hui
 But by then their family members were unaware of it
 unki maa padma balm ke faridabad ke daftar main kisi ne bhuwan kaa video tej aawaaj main chalaa diya tha
 When the mother inquired, Bhuvan requested not to tell Papa
 muskaraate hue balm kehete hai, ''yah to ho nahin saktaa ki aap maa-papa ko ek duusare se kuch chhipaane ko kahen or ve maan jaaen
 Both are very close to each other
 '' natijatan, raat ko khaane ke vakt pita avaneendra balm ne narmi se kaha tha, hamen bhi wo video dikhaao jo maa ne daftar main dekha
 After watching the video, Papa reacted against the expectation and said, "hey, we used to do this in school too
 ''khud ke nibhaae vibhinn kirdaaron ke bare main baat karte hue bhuwan bataate hai ki ve un logon kii pichhali kahaniyon ko nae tareeke se or nae logon ke lihaaj se lekin thodaa atiranjit banaakar bataane kii koshish karte hai
 His effort is successful and his character looks like common people
 unke kirdaar madhya varg ke hai or shaayad isi vajah se behad lokapriy bhi hai
 In the month of Bam, only one or two videos are posted
 ve kehete hai, ''mujhe lagata he, itnaa kaaphi he
 i am happy to do so much work

 It is necessary to live up to the expectations of one crore people

 "I sometimes try to be logical, be more funny and produce better content," says Baum

 unke kirdaar aam logon ke bich ke hai*** In Dhaulpur, Rajasthan, some people have kept three minor girls starved near the fire in these scorching heat for rain
 teenon ladkiyaan pichley paanch dinon se aag ke bich tap par baithi hai or unke aasapaas baithe log bhajan kirthan kar rahe hai
 Troubled by the lack of rain, farmers are resorting to such superstitions
 ve paramparaagat kathaon ke anusaar barish ke devtaa indra ko manaane ke liye siddh sthalon or chauraahon par bacchon ko dhoop main bithakar anga-daal kaa bhojan khilaa rahe hai
 At the same time, three girls of the village are sitting on austerity to persuade Indra Dev
 aisi hi ek bacchee puja he
 11-year-old Pooja, a resident of Pura Pataur village in Basedi subdivision, has been sitting on penance for four days
 iske alaava bhagaura gaanv main saat saal kii kalpana or 11 varshiya puja bhi isi tarah pichley paanch din se aag ke aage tap kar rahi he
 These three girls have not drunk even a single drop of water during this period
 in bacchiyon ko yun andhvishwaas kii aag main dhakelne main inke ghar or gaanv waalon kaa hi haath mana ja rahaa he, lekin police-prashasan se bachane ke liye ye log kah rahe hai ki unhen bina bataae hi ye bacchiyaan tap par baith gayi
 At the same time, the administration also came to pick up the girls on receiving this news, but those girls refused to get up from there, saying that unless it rains, they will not move from there
 is bacchiyon ke is tap kii khabar failte hi aasapaas ke mahila-purush bhi badi sankhya main vahaan pahunchane lage hai
 These people are worshiping these girls doing penance and are engaged in bhajan kirtan
 is saal mausam vibhaag kii taraf se achche monsoon ke purvanumaan ke baavjood dhaulpur jile main barish nahin hone se kisaanon ke chehre par chintaa kii lakeeren ubharne lagi hai
 After the entire fortnight of July drought, the farmers sitting in the kharif season are now looking at the sky with hope
 ilaake ke kisaan fateh singh kaa kahana he ki july kaa maheenaa nikalataa ja rahaa he
 Sowing was also delayed due to no rain and now the crop is on the verge of destruction due to lack of water
 barish na hone se kharif kii fasal ko kaaphi nuksaan ho rahaa he or ab ham ishwar kii sharan main hai
 Pratap Singh, who is present on the occasion, says that it rained two or three times in the months of June and July, but due to no rain after that, the kharif sowing time is almost over and all the fields are looking deserted
 bataa den ki pichhali baar bhi isi tarah ke naaballig ladakiyon ko barish ke liye tap par baithaaya gaya tha to police-prashasan ne gharavaalon par mukadmaa kar ladakiyon ko aspataal main bhartee karaayaa tha
 However, the blind faith of these people in blind faith does not end and every year such scenes have been seen

 Emphasis on fundamental changes During the rail camp held in December last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had stated the need for major changes in the Indian Railways
 unhone kaha tha ki railway ko maujuuda daur main puure tareeke se badalanaa hoga or nai takneekon ko apnaanaa hoga
 The Prime Minister said that as the largest transporter of the country, the Railways have no harm and the Railways should not leave any chance of earning
 iske liye unhone gaiyr kiraaya rajasav par zyada focus karne kii salaah di thi
 This is the result of the same advice from the Transformation Cell
 cell kii jimmedaaritransformation cell duniya bhar main mil rahi tamaam nai-nai takneekon kaa moolyankan karne ke saath railway ke liye mufeed technology kaa chayan karegaa
 This cell will also do the work of giving feedback to the railways about the millions of new suggestions received in the rail camp
 maujuuda samay main railway ke saamne sabase bada chalange puraani takanic ke dibbon or linon ko badalanaa he
 In the midst of all this, the recurring railway accidents indicate somewhere that the railway is far behind in terms of technology
 aane vaale samay main nai technology or railway kii inakam main saamanjasy bithaana bhi transformation cell ke liye chunauti hoga

 rosemara kii jindagi meninglish ke kuch shabdais tarah hamaari zabaan par chadh gaye hai ki ham bina soche samajhe unako bolte aa rahe hai
 There are many words that do not have any meaning, just the way we speak them in Hindi, in the same way, we have started speaking in English too
 iske alaava kuch aise bhi shabd hai jinka sahi matlab hamen nahin pataa or ham unhen galat sens main istemaal karte hai
 Let's know about some similar words: 1
 akasar ham bolte haneynirst Come First Serve
 This means that what has come before will serve those who have come later
 First Come First servebolana galat he
 If it is to be said correctly, we will say First Come First Served, which means that if you have come first then you will be served first
 saaf he ki sirf ek alfabet ko hataane or lagane se puure shabd or vaakya kaa matlab hi badal jaataa he
 2
 akasar jis college yaa skool se hamane padhai kii hoti he ham khud kaa vahaan kayeefass outstudemta bataate hai
 But in reality when you have studied from an education institute then you are a graduate there
 aap us institute seppefass outnahim hote
 Pass out means to become unconscious for a short time

 Many people speak
 udhaaharan ke lietreet’s discuss about politics
 But Discuss About is not a phrase
 discusska matlab hi hota havethalk About
 Therefore, there is no need to put the word about after separate discussion
 udhaaharan ke liye:let’s discuss politics
 5
 ham main se zyaadaatar log akasaraadho One Thingbolawe hai, jiskaa arth kaam karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 There is no sense of it really
 videshon main aisa bolne par aapkaa majaak hi udaaya jayega
 6
 hindi main ham kisi kaa naam poochhate vakt kehete hai aapkaa shubh naam kya he? isi kaa anuwaad karte hue ham english main bhi poochne lage handthhat is your good name?yah bilkul galat he
 Should be asked correctly what is your name? 7
 ek or kaaman galati hamakhindle revertka istemaal karte hue bhi karte hai
 We speak kindlyrevert in the sense of getting an answer, which is wrong
 revertka matlab hota he:go back to a previous state
 That is to return to its old state
 isliye Reply ke liekhindle revertka istemaal karnaa galat he
 8
 akasar logarhshnlak peekora sneak peakmem antar nahin kar pate hai
 Peek means Quick Look and Peak means mountain top
 sirftaauravaake hatane se donon kaa matlab badal gaya
 When we speak Sneak Peak it will not make any sense
 isliye sahi Phrase jo bolaa jaataa he wo hameshndak Peek, jiskaa matlab hota he ki kisi chiz ke aadhikarik rup se launch hone se pehle hi use dekhne kaa mauka milanaa
 9
 ham main se adhiktar lognephrosttacoufrostshatebolate hai
 The meaning has changed only by the application of r alphabet
 prostrateka matlab hota he jab aap apana cheharaa neeche karke baithe hote hai
 At the same time, the gland found in the genitals of men is called Prostate
 agar aaptfrostrate Cancerbolawe hai to iskaa matlab hota he cancer jo aapako neeche cheharaa karke baithne kii vajah se hua he
 Therefore, its correct phrase is Prostate Cancer

 Foreign Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin has said that it is entirely his privilege to use the tax money collected by his people

 26 may ko vipaksh ke bhi ek saal puure ho rahe hai
 The government as well as the opposition should also be evaluated
 puure saal ke dauraan vipaksh kii kya bhoomika rahi he or modi sarkaar ke ek saal puure hone ke sandarbh main uski kya kaary yojana he
 Has the Opposition presented any concrete criticism on this occasion apart from superficial sloganeering
 vipaksh ne sarkaar ke daavon ko nakaarne kaa kaam to kiya he lekin kya uski taraf se aise vikalp pesh kiye gaye hai, aise tark gadhe gaye hai jisase janata ke man main sarkaar kii niyat ke prati gaharaa andeh paidaa ho
 Opposing only by taking advantage of the government's lapse on a few occasions is not the opposition's job
 main vipaksh kaa moolyankan is baat par bhi nahin karnaa chahta ki kitni nitiyon main sarkaar kaa saath dekar sakaaratmak bhoomika nibhaai balki is baat ko lekar karnaa chahta hum ki sarkaar kii badi yojanaon ko vaicharik str par kya thos chunauti di gai
 It may have been a challenge from the opposition, but the challenge should be recorded on a large scale
 congress netaa digvijay singh apane bete kii shaadi kii taiyaariyaan chhodkar press conference kar modi sarkaar par sawaal to khadey karte hai, congress kii taraf se ek do press conference bhi hoti he lekin isse zyaada kuch nahin hota he
 The activism of the other parties is not more than the press conference
 jaise sarkaar kaa kaam daawa karnaa rah gaya he vaise hi vipaksh kaa kaam khaarij karnaa ho gaya he
 i watch TV less but still know that for the last one week, the ministers of the government have been appearing in the studios of news channels in such a way that they are their ministry
 kai baar to mantri is studio se nikalakar us channel ke studio main jate bhi dikhe
 Ravi Shankar Prasad here and Nitin Gadkari there
 sawaal-jawaab ke sakht yaa gambhir kaaryakramon ko jalsa main badal kar puch lene kii dostana aupchaarikta hi puri hui
 The same basic questions were asked which were being asked in TV programs for a year
 sarkaar yaa bijepi ke pravaktaa un sawaalon kaa koob jawaab de rahe the lekin ek saal ke maukey par jamini shodh ke saath hamaare patrkaar, jisamen main bhi shaamil hum, kam hi haazir rahe
 Especially the TV journalist
 vipaksh bhi darshakon kii tarah tivi dekh rahaa he yaa patrakaron ke bulaane par studio jaakar har daawey kaa khandan kar aata he
 Everyone accepted the fact that now the central government is constructing 12 km of road every day, but some more information comes from the site of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
 website par likhaa he ki 2013-14 or 2014-15 main 6,300 kimi sadak banane kaa lakshya tha
 In 2013-14, 4,260 km of roads were built during UPA and 4,410 km at the time of NDA
 nai sarkaar ne puraani sarkaar ke hi lakshya ko kyon rakhaa or puraa karne ke maamle main maamuli antar kyon he
 This is the statement made by the Union Minister of State for Road Transport in the Rajya Sabha
 usee tarah se swatchta abhiyaan kaa pardaafash tip kii kuch report kaa zikr to suna lekin kisi ne nahin poocha ki is abhiyaan ke tahat kitne safai karmchaariyon ko rakhaa gaya he, rakhaa jayega
 What system will be in place to keep the city and village clean? sirf har ghar main shauchalay banane se hi swatchta kaa lakshya to puraa nahin ho jaataa he
 The dirt is not reduced to look but looks like it used to look
 kya yah nahin poocha janaa chahie tha ki jandhan yojana ke tahat abhi tak durghatana beemaa kitnon ko mili he
 How many accounts are the government depositing money into
 jandhan ke kitne khatedaaron ne 5,000 rupee kaa overdraft kiya he
 When it can be known that 15,500 crores have been accumulated, then why cannot all this be known
 main yah nahin kahata ki kisi ne nahin poocha hoga yaa jawaab nahin diya hoga
 It may have given, but it is not just the work of the journalist to highlight these contradictions
 janata tak pahunchane kaa kaam us aalsee vipaksh kaa bhi he jo har din sarkaar ke ladkadaane ke maukey ginata he or press conference kar apana daayitv puraa kar detaa he
 Well, some leaders have visited and shown activism on the issue of farmers, but what after that
 kya isi vipaksh ne sarkaar kii krishi nitiyon ke vikalp main apni taraf se koi niti pesh kii or baadhya kiya ki aap is raste chaliye varna kisaan maare jaaenge
 The work of the opposition is not to be stopped
 uskaa kaam sarkaar se achche kaam karana bhi hota he
 One has to ask how many people got jobs and where does the reliable data come from
 bhale hi pehle kii sarkaar main nahin aata ho, lekin ummiido kii is sarkaar se dhang ke sawaal to kiye hi ja sakate hai
 The comments sarkaar pichley ek hafte se apni baat pahunchane ke liye sakriy he
 The Prime Minister is about to rally in Mathura
 sarkaar or bijepi milakar desh bhar main 200 press conference karne vaale hai
 Arun Jaitley is constantly holding press conferences
 lekin vipaksh garmi kii dopahari main susta rahaa he
 It does not see any plan to challenge the claims of the government
 kya congress bhi jawaab main 400 press conference karegi
 Will Rahul Gandhi come before the press and challenge the government's claims
 'suut, boot kii sarkaar' yaa 'chand udyogpatiyon kii sarkaar' ke naare to aasaan naare hai
 Surely the government has been troubled by these slogans and is constantly trying to counter its anti-poor image, but apart from this what is the opposition doing
 shaayad apane naaron ko hedline banate dekh khush ho rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi's footsteps are not enough to evaluate the role of the opposition
 is ek saal main vipaksh kaa bhi sakht moolyankan hona chahie
 Except the activism on a few issues in both the houses of Parliament, the opposition does not understand how to surround the government with the rest of the plans
 na sirf gheraa jaae balki janata ko is bare main bhi shikshit kiya jaae ki kyon ye yojanaayen uske hit main nahin hai
 Opposition should be asked what is the ideological and pragmatic thinking about big schemes of the government
 vipaksh ne smart city par koi rajnatik nazariyaa pesh nahin kiya
 No questions asked about Jan Dhan Yojana or Bima Yojana
 sivaay yah bataane ki ye to hamaari hi yojana thi
 The reforms in the labor laws are good or bad for the workers
 sahyogi sanghavaad par sarkaar ke daavon se alag uske daawey kya hai
 These are issues on which serious study has to be done, going through a long and honest process of thinking
 khud ko kaarij kar nae sire se khadaa karnaa hota he
 The opposition behaves like a student who just chews the nail thinking that the next number is two less
 wo zamana gaya ki chunaav haarane ke baad netaa dopaher kii neend khinchne lagate hai or sarkaar apni galatiyon se ladkadhaakar chali jaati he or ve phir satta main aa jate hai
 Responses such as the unsuccessful drama of Janata Parivar unity should also be included in opposition
 bijepi ke kilaaf congress bhale hi sankhya main kam ho lekin iske aas paas kii sankhya vaale vipaksh main kai dal he
 Did all these parties together think of a common program that would challenge the government as well as a better competition
 ho saktaa he vipaksh ne chunauti di bhi ho lekin wo chunauti bade str par darj ho iskaa prayaas to kam hi dikhataa he
 Congress leader Digvijay Singh leaves the preparations for his son's marriage and press conference to raise questions on the Modi government, there are two press conferences from the Congress side but nothing more
 baaki dalon kii sakriyata bhi press conference se zyaada kii nahin he
 As the work of the government has remained to be claimed, the work of the opposition has been dismissed
 main tivi kam dekhtaa hum lekin phir bhi andaaza he ki pichley ek hafte se sarkaar ke mantri news channelon ke studio main is tarah se haazir rahe hai jaise vahi unka mantralay ho
 Many times, the minister was seen leaving this studio and going to the studios of that channel
 yahaan ravishankar prasad to vahaan nitin gadakari
 By converting strict or serious programs of question and answer into Jalsa, the friendly formality of asking was completed
 vahi buniyadi sawaal puche gaye jo ek saal se tivi kaaryakramon main puche hi ja rahe the
 The spokespersons of the government or BJP were answering those questions very well, but on the occasion of one year, our journalists with ground research, including myself, were not present
 khaaskar tivi vaale patrkaar
 Like the audience, the opposition is watching TV or on the call of journalists, goes to the studio and refutes every claim
 sabane is tathy ko sweekaar kar liya ki ab centre sarkaar rose 12 kimi sadak bana rahi he lekin sadak parivahan or haive mantralay kii site se kuch or jaankaree milti he
 It is written on the website that in 2013-14 and 2014-15, there was a target to build 6,300 km of roads
 2013-14 yani upie ke samay 4,260 kimi sadaken baniin or endie ke samay 4,410 kimi
 Why did the new government set the target of the old government and why is there a slight difference in terms of completion? yah kendriya sadak parivahan rajya mantri kaa rajya sabha main diya gaya bayaan he
 In the same way, some reports of cleanliness campaign exposed type were heard but no one asked how many cleanliness workers have been hired under this campaign
 shahar-gaanv saaf rahe iske liye kya system banegaa
 The goal of cleanliness is not met only by having toilets in every house
 gandagi dikhni kam bhi nahin hui he balki waisi hi dikhti he jaisi dikhti thi
 Shouldn't it have been asked how many accident insurance have been received so far under the Jan Dhan Yojana
 kitne khate main sarkaar paise jamaa kara rahi he
 How many accountants of Jan Dhan have overdrafted Rs 5,000
 jab yah pataa chal saktaa he ki 15,500 karod jamaa ho gaye hai, to ye sab kyon nahin pataa chal saktaa
 i do not say that no one would have asked or answered
 diya hoga magar in antarvirodhon ko ubhaarne kaa kaam sirf patrkaar kaa nahin he
 The task of reaching out to the public is also that of the lazy opposition who counts every day the government's chances of faltering and fulfills its obligation by holding a press conference
 thik he ki kisaanon ke mudde par kuch netaaon ne daure kiye or sakriyata dikhaai lekin uske baad kya
 Did this Opposition present any policy on behalf of the government's agricultural policies and forced you to go this way or else the farmers would be killed
 vipaksh kaa kaam rokna nahin he
 His job is also to get the government to do good work
 yah poochna hota he ki kitne logon ko naukariyaan milin or milin to iskaa vishwasaneey aankada kahaan se aata he
 Even if it does not come in the earlier government, but the questions of expectations from this government can be questioned
 tippaniyan The government has been active in delivering its views for the last one week
 mathura main pradhanmantri raily karne vaale hai
 The government and BJP together will hold 200 press conferences across the country
 arun jetali lagaataar press conference kar rahe hai
 But the opposition has been slow in the mid-summer
 sarkaar ke daavon ko chunauti dene kii uski koi yojana nazar nahin aati
 Will the Congress also hold 400 press conferences in response? kya rahul gandhi press ke saamne aakar sarkaar ke daavon ko chunauti denge
 The slogans of 'suit, boot ki sarkar' or 'government of a few industrialists' are easy slogans
 zarur in naaron se sarkaar ko pareshaani hui he or wo lagaataar apni garib virdohi chhavi ko counter karne main juty hui he magar iske alaava vipaksh kya kar rahaa he
 Probably happy to see his slogans becoming headlines
 rahul gandhi kii padayatraaen kaaphi nahin hai vipaksh kii bhoomika kaa moolyankan karne ke liye
 There should also be a strict assessment of the opposition this year
 sansad ke donon sadanon main chand muddon par sakriyata ko chhod den to vipaksh ko samaj hi nahin aa rahaa he ki baaki yojanaon ko lekar sarkaar ko kaise gheraa jaae
 Not only to circle but also to educate the public about why these schemes are not in its interest
 vipaksh se poocha janaa chahie ki sarkaar kii badi yojanaon ko lekar vaicharik or vyaavhaarik soch kya he
 The opposition did not present any political outlook on the smart city
 jandhan yojana yaa beemaa yojana ke bare main koi sawaal nahin kiya
 Except to say that this was our only plan
 shram kanoonon main jo sudhaar hue he wo mazaduron ke liye acha he yaa bura he
 What are its claims different from the government's claims on collaborative federalism
 ye sab wo mudde hai jin par gambhir adhyayan karnaa padataa he, chintan kii lambii or eemaandaar prakriya se guzaranaa hota he
 Yourself has to be dismissed and raised anew
 vipaksh kaa bartaav us vidhyaarthee kii tarah he jo bas yahi sochakar nakhun chabaata rahata he ki agle ke usase do number kam aa jaae
 It was known that after losing the election, the leaders start sleeping in the afternoon and the government stumbles over its mistakes and goes back to power
 janata parivaar kii ekta ke asafal naatak jaise javaabon ko bhi vipaksh ke hisaab main shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 The Congress may be less in number against the BJP, but there are many parties in the opposition with the numbers around it
 kya in sabhi dalon ne milakar koi saajha kaarykram ke bare main sochaa jisase sarkaar ko bhi chunauti milti or ek behatar pratispardhaa bhi hoti
 i watch TV less but still know that for the last one week, the ministers of the government have been appearing in the studios of news channels in such a way that they are their ministry
 kai baar to mantri is studio se nikalakar us channel ke studio main jate bhi dikhe

 Responses such as the unsuccessful drama of Janata Parivar unity should also be included in opposition
 bijepi ke kilaaf congress bhale hi sankhya main kam ho lekin iske aas paas kii sankhya vaale vipaksh main kai dal he

 Tendulkar competed in six consecutive World Cups from 1992 to 2011, in which he scored 56 in 44 innings of 45 matches
 95 kii ausat se 2278 ran banaaye jo ki is toornament kaa record he
 It is sure that this record will remain untouched this time
 vishwacap main tendulkar ke baad sarvaadhik ran banane vaale ballebaajon kii suchi main australia ke purv captain riki ponting kaa naam aata he jo is bhartiya kii tarah cricket se sanyas le chuke hai
 Ponting has scored 1743 runs in 46 matches
 australia or newjiland main 14 farvari se shuru hone vaale vishwacap main jo khilaadi khelenge unamem kumaar sangakaara ke naam par sarvaadhik 991 ran darj hai
 He is followed by another Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene (975 runs)
 sangakaara ko tendulkar kii barabari par pahunchane ke liye 1287 or jayavardhane ko 1303 ranon kii jarurat padegi jo ki asambhav lagata he
 The record for the most runs in any one World Cup is in Tendulkar's name
 unhone 2003 main 11 maichon main 673 ran banaaye the
 Tendulkar will also hold the record for the most runs scored in any one country
 unhone bhartiya sarajameen par 15 maichon main 977 ran banaaye hai
 None of the current players have played a World Cup match in Australia or New Zealand
 antarrashtriya cricket main 100 shatak jadne vaale tendulkar ne vishwa cap main ricard chah saikade lagaaye hai
 Among the current batsmen, AB de Villiers and Jayawardene have three centuries each
 ye donon ballebaaj acchhee farm main hai or aise main unki nigaah tendulkar ke sarvaadhik shatakon ke record par rahegi
 But it will be difficult for anyone to reach the record of Tendulkar's fifties

 lekin chaukon ke maamle main tendulkar number ek hai
 He has hit a record 241 fours in six World Cups
 tendulkar ke baad ponting (145) or adam gilcrist (141) kaa number he
 Among the current batsmen, both Jayawardene and Sangakkara have hit the same 90 fours
 tendulkar ke record tak pahunchane ke liye unhen 151 chauke lagane honge
 For the record, tell that the maximum 75 boundaries were in any one World Cup
 tendulkar ne yah karnama 2003 main africa mahadweep main khele gaye vishwacap main kiya tha
 The World Cup inaugural match will be played between Sri Lanka and New Zealand on 14 February and Sangakkara will then set a record as he scores 91 runs
 divilliars bhi westeindies ke khilaaf 102 ran banane par tendulkar ke is record tak pahunche jaaenge
 South Africa and West Indies will be face to face in Sydney on 27 February
 vishwacap main sarvaadhik gendon kaa saamana karne or sarvaadhik minute krij par bitaane kaa ricard bhi tendulkar ke naam par he
 He has faced 2560 balls in the World Cup
 unke alaava keval ek anya ballebaaj 2000 se adhik gendon kaa saamana kar paaya
 He is Ponting (2180 balls)
 sangakaara or jayavardhane is record main vartmaan samay ke ballebaajon kii aguwai karte hai
 He has played 1259 and 1112 balls respectively
 sangakaara ko tendulkar ke record tak pahunchane ke liye 1301 or jayavardhane ko 1448 gend khelni hongi

 a senior Kolkata Police official said that the number of illegal dance bars has increased in the last four to five years due to the lump between land mafia and promoters
 adhikari ne kaha, pramotor sasti daron par bhu-mafiaon se jaminen kharid rahe hai or is par ve baron ke liye imaaraten bana lete hai
 Once the bar is formed, then the promoters have to pay some part of the profits to these land mafias

 After a long time, reaching out to the stand for the media himself, he said, "congress has government in its hands
" bahumat he, jo manamaani karnaa he, karen, lekin janata ke bich jawaab dena hoga
 Congress has insulted our MP on the strength of majority

 "the issue of reservation in promotion in government jobs has now stood in the queue of Lokpal and Women's Reservation Bill, where there is a will but there is no way of consent in vote bank politics

 narayansami se bill chhinane ke liye upi kii nagina surakshit seat se dalit saansad yashavir singh ko aage badhaayaa
 But suddenly Congress President Sonia Gandhi jumped up and tried to withdraw the bill from Yashveer and in a few moments Congress MP Vilas Muttemwar confronted Yashveer in defense of the Congress President
 is ghatnakram ke baad mulaayam ne yah aarope lagaaya, ''bill chhinane kii ghatana sansad main koi pehali baar nahin hui he
 This has been done before also, but the members of Congress started killing our distinguished member
 ” lekin duusare din hi yashavir ne loksabhaa spikar ke saamne khed jataa diya
 Despite this, the 117th Constitutional Amendment bill related to reservation in promotion got stuck in the Lok Sabha

 He had said a day before, "this bill is unconstitutional and discriminatory in society, so we will continue to oppose this bill and we are ready to bear every consequence for it
" ” lekin loksabhaa main bill ke atak jane se basapa supremeo mayawati ke tevar tikhe ho gaye hai
 During the debate on the bill in the Lok Sabha, Mayawati was present in the special gallery with her team and was watching the entire proceedings, then the Congress, which was stuck in difficulty, could not muster the courage to move forward on the bill
 lekin mayawati ne ab sidhe sarkaar kii niyat par andeh jataayaa he
 Expressing his displeasure, he said, "when SP mps in the Lok Sabha had torn the bill and were creating ruckus in the House, the government did not take action against those members
" ” unhone kaha ki ve jald hi pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko chitthee likhakar sansad kaa vishesh satr bulaane kii maang karengi
 But on Maya's allegations, Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said that the aggressive attitude of Sonia Gandhi herself to get the bill passed in the Lok Sabha can be gauged by the government's seriousness
 haalanki aankadon ke khel main kamjor congress kii sabase badi mushkil philhal sapa-basapa donon ko saath lekar chalane kii he, isliye vah donon ko puchkaar rahi he
 The Congress passed the bill with bjp's support after Mayawati's sharp remarks in the Rajya Sabha and directly targeting Speaker Hamid Ansari, but the government did not show the will even if the situation turned hostile in the Lok Sabha
 sapa ke virodh ko rajyasabha main bhale koi saathi nahin mila, lekin loksabhaa main use us vakt sanjivani mil gai, jab bijepi khud main hi ulajh gai

 haalanki bijepi sansadeey dal kii baithak main bhi yah maamla mukhar rup se uthaa tha
 But in order to avoid confusion between the two houses taking different positions, BJP in the meeting with the speaker made a move to take the opinion of the Supreme Court on this bill
 bijepi netaaon ne daleel di ki sansad jati ke aadhaar par banty dikh rahi he, jiskaa samaaj par galat asar pad saktaa he
 However, regarding this bill, Minister of State for Personnel Narayanasamy made it clear in the Rajya Sabha that the reservation limit is 22
 5 fisadi bani rahegi
 He also clarified that this bill will not affect the officers who got promotion before 1995 and for this they will write a letter to the states

 The two complement each other
 unhone kaha ki dharm main paakhand aayega, to uske liye raajnneeti jaruri he
 But when politics comes to the fore, religion is necessary for its purity

 After Airtel, now the message of unlimited 4G data of BSNL on whatsapp for a year is going viral
 is massej ke saath ek link bhi he, or logon se kaha ja rahaa he ki is par clic karke aap is ofer kaa laabh uthaa sakate hai
 But you should be careful and do not pay any attention to it, because there is no such offer from BSNL
 yah massej puri tarah se frod he or yah aapse aapaki samvedansheel jaankariyaan churaai ja sakati he
 However, it is definitely that BSNL will soon launch a Rs 148 plan to compete with Reliance Jio
 isamen maheene bhar tak analimited local or astidi kol milegi or 300MB data milegaa

 On the last day, the conference on climate change in Morocco seems far away from any major success
 guuruuvaar shaam ko sammelan main jo prastaav paas kiya gaya, wo kaaphi dhilaa-dhaala or beasar dikhaa
 Talks in this conference are caught in the mutual tussle between countries, rather than pursuing the Paris deal passed to fight global warming
 iske alaava is baat kaa bhi koi zikr nahin he ki amir desh apni zimmedaari kaise nibhaayenge
 Harjit Singh of Action Aid said that "developed countries have been running away from the responsibility of reducing carbon emissions by 2020 at the Morocco conference and are looking to juggle the data rather than implementing the help that is to be provided under the Paris deal" Huh
 " Although the proposal passed in Morocco for formalization, it has been said to give priority to fighting global warming and it is also believed that the earth is warming very fast, which makes the situation worrying, but the knowledgeable Morocco has Calling the proposal hollow and ineffective
 climet ection network (south asia) ke nideshak sanjay vashishtha ne enditivi india se kaha, "paris main saare deshon ne saath aakar ek ummid jagaai or phir saal bhar ke bheetar sabhi deshon ne paris deal ko lagu kiya, jisamen sabhi deshon kii zimmedaari tay kii gai he, vahiin morocco ke sammelan main viksit desh global warming se ladane main aarthik madad kii zimmedaari se bhaagate dikhe hai
 "comments vashishtha ne enditivi india ko bataaya ki "asal main amir deshon ne is prastaav ke paas hone se pehle hi apni report main ye kah diya ki 2020 tak climet fund main di jane vaali 100 arab dollar kii rakam kaa aadhe se adhik vah de chuke hai
 The truth is that rich countries are running away from their responsibilities
 abhi tak is fund main sirf 10 arab dollar kaa hi vaada kiya gaya he
 The money that is to be received when the new President of America Donald Trump arrives, is also under threat
 " climet fund banane kii baat 2010 main pehali baar hui, jiske tahat global warming se ladane ke liye amir or viksit deshon ko ek fund main dhan jamaa karnaa he taaki vikasshil or garib desh saaf suthri urja banane ke tareeke dhund saken or spes main or carbon jamaa na ho, lekin amir deshon ne morocco main jo rukh jataayaa he vah niraash karne vaala he
 India's environment minister Anil Madhav Dave had already expressed concern in climate speech in his speech about lack of money from rich countries
 iske alaava kai aise mudde hai, jin par is sammelan main baat aage nahin badi
 One of these is the devastating impact on the poor and developing countries from the ever increasing disasters
 ye bahes lambey samay se chal rahi he ki viksit deshon ke carbon utsarjan kii vajah se jalwaayu parivartan kaa prabhaav vinaashkari aapadaayen badha rahaa he
 So these countries should take responsibility for this, but at the moment the talks on this issue have been postponed at the Morocco conference
 ection aid ke harjit singh ne kaha ki "morocco sammelan main viksit desh 2020 tak carbon utsarjan kam karne kii zimmedaari se bhaagate nazar aae hai or paris deal ke tahat jo madad di jaani he, us par amal karne ke bajaay aankadon kii baazeegari karte dikh rahe hai
 " haalanki aupchaarikta ke liye morocco main paas hue prastaav main global warming se ladane ko praathamikta dene kii baat kahi gai he or ye bhi mana gaya he ki dharti bahut tezi se garam ho rahi he, jisase halaat chintajanak bane hue hai, lekin jaankaar morocco main paas hue prastaav ko khokhla or prabhaavaheen bataa rahe hai
 Climate Action Network (south Asia) director Sanjay Vashisht told NDTV India, "all the countries in Paris came together and raised an expectation and then within a year all the countries implemented the Paris deal, in which the responsibility of all the countries was fixed
 At the same time, in Morocco's conference, developed countries are seen running away from the responsibility of financial help in fighting global warming
 " tippaniyan Vashistha told NDTV India that "in fact, the rich countries had already given more than half of the $ 100 billion in climate funds to be given by 2020 in their report even before the proposal was passed
 sachai yah he ki amir desh apni zimmedaari se bhaag rahe hai
 So far, only $ 10 billion has been promised in this fund
 america ke nae raashtrapati donald trump ke aane par to jo paisa milanaa he, us par bhi khatara mandara rahaa he
 "the idea of creating a climate fund was first introduced in 2010, under which rich and developed countries have to fund a fund to fight global warming so that developing and poor countries can find ways to create clean energy and create more carbon in space
" Not to accumulate, but the stance that rich countries have expressed in Morocco is disappointing
 bharat ke paryaavaran mantri anil madhav dave ne climet finance yani amir deshon kii ore se milane vaale paise kii kami ko lekar pehle hi apane bhaashan main chintaa jataai thi

 Meanwhile, he got information about Baba Ramdev's yoga camp to be held at Gandhi Maidan in Patna
 vahaan jaakar pati dipanarayan prasad ke saath ek haftaa pranayam or yogasana siikhaa
 What was there was Anandi Devi joined yoga
 yah naata judaa to bimaariyaan khatm hone lageen
 Anandi Devi made up her mind that she would not confine herself to this boon of yoga
 isse dusron ko bhi madad pahunchaayengi
 Since 2010, she has been continuously teaching yoga to women in the neighborhood
 anandi devi ne india today se kaha, ''beemaari se jujhate-jujhate main khud ko mara hua maanane lagi thi
 But yoga gave me new life
 isliye maine thaan liya ki main zyada se zyada logon ko yoga se madad pahunchaaungi
 '' Anandi teaches yoga for two to three hours every morning
 seekhney waalon main mohalle hi nahin baahar kii mahilaayein bhi hai
 Today she is known as Yoga Guru
 70 varshiya kanchanamala ghutane ke dard se pareshaan thim
 Anandi Devi did yoga regularly to her and it gave her great relief
 52 varshiya urmila devi kahati hai ki unhen jodon main dard ke alaava allergy or peptic ulcer bhi tha
 But she wanted to learn yoga from a male yoga teacher, not a man
 anandi devi ne unki yah pareshaani sulajhaa di
 The line of such women is long

 Seeing this dedication towards yoga, Patanjali Yoga Committee made Anandi Devi the co-district in-charge of Mahila Patanjali Yoga Committee
 ve patanjali ke yoga shivi main bhi yoga sikhaati hai
 Manmohan Krishna, the college in-charge of Patanjali's Yuva Bharat unit, says that he was entrusted with this responsibility after being influenced by Anandi Devi's dedication
 pati deep narayan prasad kehete hai ki parivaar ke log anandi ko boj samajhane lage the par unhone yoga se naata jodakar parivaar ke tiraskaar ko khud ke liye sammaan main badal diya
 In the beginning, Anandi used to do yoga alone
 ek-do mahilaayein or aane lageen, phir ek toli ban gai
 Now when they camp in Gandhi Maidan, then women come as well as men have started coming
 das saal pehle bimariyon se jujh rahi anandi devi aaj 68 varsh kii hai
 She is showing the way to those who give up hope of living with the disease

 a three-member bench of Justice Altamas Kabir, Justice SS Nijjar and Justice Gyan Sudha Mishra gave the state government two weeks to look into the idea

 The dance floor remains
 sirf aisa hone se vah ashleel yaa aapattijanak nahin ho jaataa
 The court asked former state Solicitor General Gopal Subramaniam to look into whether the Sections 33 and 34 of the Bombay Police Act could be amended in such a way that only prohibited the obscene and objectionable format of the dance to be done
 bombai ucch nyaayalay ne baar or restraon main hone vaale dance sho par pratibandh lagaate mumbai police ke faisle ko varsh 2006 main nirast kar diya tha
 Police banned dance shows on the grounds that dancing in bars and restaurants is obscene and provocative and many girls indulge in prostitution

 Abhay Deol, a prolific actor who played a Pakistani youth in the recently released film 'happy Bhag Jayegi', has slammed the Modi government on the Pakistani artist ban issue
 abhaya deyol ne is mudde par puche gaye sawaal par kaha ki vah modi sarkaar ko gambhirtha se nahin lete
 He said, 'if there is talk of banning Pakistani artistes, then i believe that only artists of Pakistan are being banned
 main chahta hum ki pakistan ke saath ho rahe vyapaar par bhi bain lagaaya jaae vahaan se aayaat-niryaat ho raheen sabhi chizon par bain lagaaya janaa chahie
 If a ban is to be imposed, then all things should be fully imposed; if you do half the work, no one takes you seriously
 isliye main bhi apni sarkaar ko gambhirtha se nahin letaa
 'abhay Deol further said about Modi government,' What is happening right now does not make you think that you want to do all this, just to make publicity
 main aapako puraa saport karata agar isse pakistan ko kaai fark padataa yaa hamaare javaanon ko isse koi phayda miltaa
 Before Abhay Deol, Bollywood director Anurag Kashyap had also questioned PM Modi while giving his opinion on the culinary artist ban issue
 unhone kaha tha, 'sar, aapane abhi tak pakistani pradhanmantri se mulaakaat ke liye maafee nahin maangi he, jabaki usee dauraan 25 disambar ko karan johar 'i dil he mushkil' kii shooting kar rahe the

 bharat ke itihaas kaa sabase bada bank ghotaalaa kyon hua?kyonki hamane sawaal poochne band kar die,hamen shaq karte rahanaa chahie tha: sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par,raturaat vishaal ho jaati companiyon par,bank karj par chal rahe kaarobaaron paraor sabase zyada sawaal hamen karne chahie the un ghotaalon kii jaanch par jo adaalaton main dam tod gayi
 Every financial scam is done more cleanly and recklessly than the previous
 or nigahbaan pichley kii tulana main or zyada naakaara paae jate hai
 These scamsters even said that whatever they do, they should do it
 is ghotaale kaa kissa bas itnaa he ki neerav or mehul ne kethan paarekh or harshad mehta kii tarah bainkon ke bich len-dein or choti avadhi ke karj kaa istemaal kiya, videsh main videshi mudra main bhugtan le liya or chanpat ho gaye

 Actually, when the PNB informed the matter to the stock exchange, it was found out what happened
 kaarobaariyon ko janata kii adaalat main laayaa janaa chahie
 50 crores Rs
 se upar kii prayek company ke liye janata ko bhagidaari dene or share bazaar main soochikaran kii shart jaruri he
 Ten thousand crores in India
 tak ke kaarobaar vaali companiyaan hai, jo bainkon se karj leti hai or company vibhaag ke paas ek salanaa ritern bharkar chuttee paa jaati hai
 We do not know what she is doing and when she will be upset
 is paardarshita se nivesh ke avasar bhi badhenge
 If you want a loan, then show capital
 If the promoter does not take a risk on his capital, then why risk a deposit (debt finance) rule on debt? ab un companiyon kii jarurat he jo paardarshita ke saath janata se puunji lekar kaarobaar karti hai yaa phir pravartak apni puunji lagaate hai
 There are more potholes
 We were eroding the mountain of outstanding bank loans (npas) and nirav-mehul short-term buyers' credit (90-180-360 days) loaning Rs 11,000 crore
 (yaa 20,000 karod ru
 ) Le flees, which the importers use for working capital
 udhaar main kaarobaar, supplai chen kii kamajori or kharaab cash flo kii vajah se bhartiya companiyaan sakriy kaarobaari (varking) puunji ko lekar hameshaa dabaav main rahati hai
 When large companies of India to make their operations comfortable, the annual revenue of four trillion rupees
 (arnst and yang—2016) kii atirikt varking capital chahie to choti fermon kii kya haalat hogi
 There should be a change in the system of short-term loans from banks

 The amount of this scam is ten times the profits of PNB
 bank ko haal main sarkaar se jitani puunji mili thi, uskaa doguna yah donon lut le gaye
 As the size of the economy increases, the country needs big banks to withstand such shocks
 bhrashtachar cheharaa dekhakar yaa bhaashanon se nahin rukta
 Successes against institutional corruption have always come only with the help of institutions (law, courts, auditors)
 pichley chaar saal main na to sansthaaen majboot or viksit huin or na nae kanoon, niyam banaae yaa badale gaye
 So the corruption was bliss as long as it was closed, now it is opening then it is blooming
 bank kisi bhi arthvyavastha main bharose kaa aakhri centre hai

 Because today the reduction in petrol prices may be announced
 iske liye buudhvaar ko tel companiyaan baithak bhi kar rahi hai
 The fire in petrol prices may get colder now

 If this happens, prices will fall for the second time in the month of November
 16 november ko bhi petrol kii keemat main 2 rupye 22 paise kii kami kii gai thi
 It is believed that due to the decrease in petrol prices in the international market, oil companies can reduce the prices
 aapako bataa den ki agar keemat ghati to desh ke chaar bade shaharon main kya honge petrol ke nae rate
 The price of petrol in Delhi is 66 rupees 42 paise which will be reduced to 65 rupees 40 paise
 kolkatamein petrol kii keemat he 70 rupye 84 paise jisaki nai keemat ho jaaegi 69 rupye 82 paise
 In Mumbai, the price of oil will be reduced from 71 rupees 47 paise to 70 rupees 45 paise, the price of petrol in Chennai will be 70 rupees 38 paise to 69 rupees 36 paise
 ek rupye 2 paise hi sahi, agar petrol kii keemat main kami hui to kamartod mahangaai se upabhoktaaon ko kuch to raahat milegi hi
