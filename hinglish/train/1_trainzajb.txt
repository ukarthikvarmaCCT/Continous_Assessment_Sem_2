 bhagwaan shiv bhakton kii puja se jald prasann hone vaale dev hai or har yug main apane bhakton kii raksha ke liye avatar liye hai
 Lord Shiva has taken 12 Rudra avatars out of which Hanuman avatar is considered superior
 hanuman ke janm par kya kehete hai shastrashastron main rambhakt hanuman ke janm kii do tithi kaa ullekh miltaa he
 First of all, he is considered to be an incarnation of Lord Shiva, because Anjani, the mother of Rambhakta Hanuman, had done severe penance of Lord Shiva and sought to get him as a son
 tab bhagwaan shiv ne pawan dev ke rup main apni raudra shakti kaa ansh yajna kunda main arpit kiya tha or vahi shakti anjani ke garbh main pravisht hui thi
 Then Hanumanji was born on the full moon of Chaitra Shukla Paksha
 ye hai hanumanji ke 15 anuthe mandir
 
 
 Come find out why Lord Shiva incarnated Hanuman
 
 
 puranic katha ke anusaarpuranic kathaon ke anusaar ravan kaa ant karne ke liye bhagwaan vishnu ne ram kaa avatar liya tha
 At that time all the gods had incarnated to serve Lord Rama in different forms
 pavanputra hanuman kii in 10 baton se aap honge anjaan
 
 
 At the same time Lord Shankar also took his Rudra avatar and the reason behind this was that he received the boon of bondage from Lord Vishnu
 hanuman unke gyarahawein rudra avatar hai
 In this form, Lord Shankar also served Rama and also helped him in killing Ravana
 hanumanji kii puja se shant rahete hai shanidev

 In the midst of all the internal discord and attempts at reconciliation in the Samajwadi Party, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said that the people of Uttar Pradesh have made up their mind that a Samajwadi Party government should be formed in the coming time
 unhone ishaaron-ishaaron main yah bhi kaha ki ''jab chunavi taarikh aa jaaen to samaj lo 'ladaai' shuru ho gai or main chahta hum ki pradesh kii janata ek baar phir kaam karne waalon ko vot den''
 However, the Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav did not give any direct answer regarding the possibility of reconciliation
 akhilesh ne media se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki 'kam se kam virdohi party ke log apana kaam to bataaen
 In democracy, there is at least an assessment and if the people assess, then the Samajwadi Party will work to restore power again
 party main ghamaasan or samjhaute ke mudde ko lekar akhilesh ne kaha ki 'main samajhataa hum ki yah samay aisa he ki samaajawaadee siddhant kaise aage badhen
 Socialist ideology and how to reach further
 samaajwaadiyon ke aashirwad se mujhe kaam karne kaa mauka mila, shaayad unheen kaa ashish tha ki kaam ho paae
 Netaji himself had asked whether the expressway could be built in 23 months
 
 
 hamane ise 23 maheene main hi banaakar dikhaa diya
 Metro will never be built in such a short time in the country
 isliye main kah rahaa hum ki loktantr main netaji ne mujhe mauka diya or unheen ke aashirwad se hamane itnaa kaam kiya he
 People are confident that the Samajwadi Party will work
 isliye jab kaam diya he, kaam kiya he or ab to ham bhi yah kehete hai ki samaajwaadiyon kaa kaam bhi bolta he'
 The comments unhone aage kaha ki 'aaj pradesh main sabase zyada kaam samaajwaadiyon ne kiya he
 People have brought the socialist ideology here by struggling a lot
 main apni jimmedaari ko nibhaaoongaa
 Kama and Netaji's blessings will bring change in this state '
 party main abhi tak samjhauta na ho paane kii vajahon se sambandhit sawaal puche jane par akhilesh ne kaha ki raajnneeti main jab faisle lene kii baat ho to aane vaala samay kaise acha ho, samaajwaadiyon kaa bhavishya kaise acha ho, main samajhataa hum vah samaajwaadiyon se zyada behatar koi bhi nahin jaanata he
 Therefore, the answer to your question is that how should socialist principles, socialist programs and decisions that have been made for the general public, farmers and laborers proceed
 isliye jo kaam samaajwaadiyon ne kiye hai, wo jameen par utaare hai'
 Talking to the media, Akhilesh said that at least the people of the opposing party should tell their work
 loktantr main kam se kam akalan hota he or agar janata akalan karegi to samaajawaadee party ko dobaaraa satta main pahunchane kaa kaam karegi'
 On the issue of arrogance and compromise in the party, Akhilesh said that 'I understand that this is the time how socialist principles should move forward
 samaajawaadee vichaardhaara or kaise aage tak jaaen
 With the blessings of the socialists, i got an opportunity to work, perhaps it was his blessing that things could be done
 netaji ne hi kaha tha ki kya express-ve 23 maheene main ban saktaa he
 
 
 We made it in 23 months
 metro desh main kabhi itane kam vakt main nahin bani hogi
 That is why i am saying that in democracy, Netaji gave me a chance and with his blessings we have done so much work
 logon ko bharosa he ki samaajawaadee party kaam karegi
 That is why when we have given work, we have worked and now we also say that the work of socialists also speaks'
 tippaniyan He further said that 'today the socialists have done the most work in the state
 logon ne kaaphi sangharsh kar samaajawaadee vichaardhaara ko yahaan tak pahunchaaya he
 i will fulfill my responsibility
 kaam or netaji kaa aashirwad is pradesh main parivartan laaenge'
 Asked questions related to the reasons why the party has not yet reached a compromise, Akhilesh said that when it comes to taking decisions in politics, how is the future ahead, how is the future of the socialists better, i think he is more than the socialists Nobody knows better
 isliye aapke sawaal kaa jawaab isi main he ki samaajawaadee siddhant, samaajawaadee kaarykram or faisle jo aam janata, kisaan or majdoor ke liye hue hai, wo kaise aage badhen
 Therefore, the works which the socialists have done, they have landed on the ground '
 party main ghamaasan or samjhaute ke mudde ko lekar akhilesh ne kaha ki 'main samajhataa hum ki yah samay aisa he ki samaajawaadee siddhant kaise aage badhen
 Socialist ideology and how to reach further
 samaajwaadiyon ke aashirwad se mujhe kaam karne kaa mauka mila, shaayad unheen kaa ashish tha ki kaam ho paae

 Asked questions related to the reasons why the party has not yet reached a compromise, Akhilesh said that when it comes to taking decisions in politics, how is the future ahead, how is the future of the socialists better, i think he is more than the socialists Nobody knows better
 isliye aapke sawaal kaa jawaab isi main he ki samaajawaadee siddhant, samaajawaadee kaarykram or faisle jo aam janata, kisaan or majdoor ke liye hue hai, wo kaise aage badhen
 Therefore, the works which the socialists have done, they have landed on the ground '
 party main abhi tak samjhauta na ho paane kii vajahon se sambandhit sawaal puche jane par akhilesh ne kaha ki raajnneeti main jab faisle lene kii baat ho to aane vaala samay kaise acha ho, samaajwaadiyon kaa bhavishya kaise acha ho, main samajhataa hum vah samaajwaadiyon se zyada behatar koi bhi nahin jaanata he
 Therefore, the answer to your question is that how should socialist principles, socialist programs and decisions that have been made for the general public, farmers and laborers proceed
 isliye jo kaam samaajwaadiyon ne kiye hai, wo jameen par utaare hai'

 sampann varg ke prati yah aakrosh bhale hi vampanthi tevar lage lekin is pustak main bataai gai bharat kii kahani kii saamaajik sachai itani kadavi he ki hamen usase koi shikaayat nahin he
 We should make a difference from the fact that if an economist Prime Minister's government had not wasted ten years of the country's life, this book might not have been written
 aaie padhate hai pustak anshaivah desh bana nahin, jiskaa khwab thabharat kii uplabdhiyon kii gaatha ko khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa, lekin kya kahani bas itani si he? sahi taur par vikaas kii disha main teji se aage badhate desh kii chamakati tasviir yakini taur par jamini hakeekat kaa vyapak, yaa santulit khaakaa nahin pesh karti
 There are many flaws here — some are too big — though the privileged class, especially the celebratory media, often prefer to ignore them
 hamen saaf taur par yah bhi maananaa hoga ki janamanas ke saamne in samasyaon ko pesh na karnaa yaa unhen maamuli dikhaanaa behad mahangaa pad saktaa he, kyonki loktantric sudhaar mukhya rup se janata kii samaj or un gambhir samasyaon par kii gai vyapak bahes par nirbhar karata he jinase takaraane or jinhen hal karne kii jarurat he
 India has made rapid economic growth in recent times, which has often been celebrated with great enthusiasm, but it is also important to consider the fact that the economic progress in India did not have much impact on social conditions
 haal ke varshon main sirf aamadani ke vitaran main hi asamanta nahin ai (bharat kii yah pravriti china se mail khaati he), balki china main vaastavik mazdooree main hui tej vruddhi ke saath bharat kii apekshaakrit sthir padi vaastavik mazdooree mail nahin bitha pai
 The second important point is that government money collected from rapid economic development was not used in a determined and planned manner to expand social and physical infrastructure (in which India is far behind China)

 While India is overtaking other countries in terms of its real income, in the South Asian region itself, it is lagging behind these countries in terms of many social indicators
 haalanki bharat kii jidipi vikaas dar ke maamle main china ke saath barabari par chal rahi he, lekin lambii aayu, sakshartaa, bacchon main kuposhan or matra mrityu dar jaise sanketakon par yah china se kaaphi peeche he
 a country with a weak economy in South Asia, Bangladesh has overtaken India in terms of several social indicators (life expectancy, vaccination of children, infant mortality, undernutrition in children and schooling of girls)
 yahaan tak ki nepal bhi prati vyakti jidipi mahaj ek-tihaai hone ke baavjood kai saamaajik sanketakon par bharat kii barabari par aa pahunchaa he
 It is worth noting that twenty years ago India was ranked second among six South Asian countries (india, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan) in terms of best social indicators
 vahiin ab vah lagbhag aakhri seedhi par khadaa dikhaai de rahaa he (sabase nichali paaydaan par samasyagrast pakistan he)

 swatantraaa kii ladaai ke peeche bharat kaa uddeshy vikaas or samanta hasil karnaa tha, par vah is maamle main nishchit rup se vifal rahaa he
 The distribution of income generated by economic development was not only uneven, but also the newly created resources were not used in such a way that the needs of the disadvantaged groups of society could be met
 loktantric shaktiyaan vartmaan bharat main vyaapt anyaaypurna sthitiyon kaa nivaaran karne kii bajaae duusari dishaao main mud gayi
 In order to improve the standard of living of the people and to overcome the huge inequalities present in the economy and society of India, work has to be done to make proper use of the achievements of economic development
 haal ke dashakon main khaskar pichley koi das varshon main bharat main teji se ho rahe aarthik vikaas kaa record jaahir he, utsahvardhak rahaa he
 In the last decade, the standard of living of the 'middle class' (ie the top 20 per cent of the population by income) has been much better than expected
 lekin rickshaw chaalak, gharelu kaamgaar yaa eent-bhattha mazdooron jaise kai anya logon ke liye kahani thodi jatil he
 This period of economic reform was not very encouraging for them and for underprivileged groups like them
 aisa nahin ki unke jivan main kuch bhi sudhaar nahin hua, lekin badlaav kii gati behad sust rahi or unke mushkil halaat main shaayad hi koi tabdili ai
 According to data from the National Sample Survey, average spending per capita in rural areas showed an increase between 1993-94 and 2009-10 with a very low rate of about 1 per cent per year, even in urban areas
 Spending increased by only 2 percent
 aarthik sudhaar ke baad kii avadhi main vaastavik krishi mazdooree kii badhotaree main baari kami iah 1980 ke dashak main yah prati varsh kareeb 5 fisadi kii dar par tha jo 1990 ke dashak main 2 fisadi tak gir gaya or 2000 ke dashak main lagbhag shunya par ja pahunchaa
 After the implementation of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) after 2006, real agricultural wages increased, especially in relation to women
 arthvyavastha kii anya ikaayiyon main bhi vaastavik mazdooree main apekshaakrit dhimi vruddhi hui, khaskar asthaayee yaa (tathakthith) ‘akushal’ shramikon ke liye
 In this regard, the result obtained by comparison with China is quite shocking
 antarrashtriya shram sanghathan ke antarrashtriya aankadon ke anusaar china ke nirmaan kshetra main is sadi ke pehle dashak main vaastavik mazdooree main ascharyajanak rup se 12 pratishat kii dar se vruddhi dekhi gai, jabaki bharat main yah vruddhi prati varsh kareeb 2
 5 percent is recorded 
 china ke sarkari aankadon main badha-chadhaakar bataae jane kii ashanka se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 But several independent studies have clearly confirmed that real wages in China have increased rapidly in the last 20 or 30 years
 iske ulat bharat main vaastavik mazdooree kii vruddhi dar isi avadhi main prati vyakti sakal gharelu utpaada kii tulana main kaaphi kam rahi
 These facts will surprise those who have a habit of assessing the living conditions of the poor, citing government estimates
 udhaaharan ke liye, yojana ayog ke anusaar, gramin nirdhan ‘aabaadi anupaat’ (garibi rekha ke neeche gramin aabaadi kaa anupaat) 1993-94 ke kareeb 50 pratishat se ghatakar 2009-10 main 34 fisadi ho gaya tha
 This seems like a major improvement
 lekin yah tathy gale se nahin utarataa ki vaastavik prati vyakti kharch main vruddhi itani kam kaise ho sakati he? sach yah he ki kai log sarkari nirdhantaa rekha se anshmaatr neeche hai, lihaaja prati vyakti kharch main thodi vruddhi se bhi unka str garibi rekha ko ‘paar’ karne ke liye paryaapt hota he
 India disappears in the map of India There are some flaws in the 'vikas Marg' of India
 iskaa sanket is baat se miltaa he ki prati vyakti aay main vruddhi ke maamle main shandaar pradarshan karne ke baavjood bharat kai saamaajik sanketakon ke sandarbh main duusare dakshin asian deshon ke (pakistan ke apwaad ke saath) mukaable peeche chal rahaa he
 It is good to start with a comparison between Bangladesh and India
 pichley kareeb 20 varshon ke dauraan bharat bangladesh ke mukaable bahut zyada amir ho gaya haih bharat kii prati vyakti aay 1990 main bangladesh ke mukaable 60 fisadi zyada thi or 2011 tak uske mukaable doguni hone kaa anumaan tha
 However, during the same period, Bangladesh overtook India in a long list of basic social indicators, including life expectancy, child survival, increased immunization, low fertility rates, and some (not all) schooling indicators — both in 1990
 The age of survival in the countries was more or less same
 lekin 2010 main bharat ke mukaable bangladesh main iske chaar saal adhik (kramshah 65 or 69 saal) ho jane kaa anumaan tha
 Similarly, in 1990 it was estimated that the child mortality rate in Bangladesh, which is a tragic indicator, is 20 per cent higher than India, but by 2011 it fell sharply to 25 per cent less than India
 bharat kii prati vyakti aay ke mukaable aadhi se bhi kam aay hone ke baavjood bangladesh zyaadaatar saamaajik sanketakon par ab bharat se behatar sthiti main he
 The story of Nepal is also no less interesting
 tamaam rajnatik or prashasnic samasyaon ke baavjood vah teji ke saath bharat kii barabari par pahunch rahaa he or kuch maamalon main aage bhi nikal rahaa he
 Nepal lagged behind India on almost every development indicator during the 1990s
 aaj, bharat main prati vyakti aay nepal ke mukaable teen guna zyada hone ke baavjood donon deshon ke saamaajik vikaas sanketakon main zyada samanta najar aati he (kuch maamalon main ab bhi bharat behatar he to kuch main isse ulat sthiti he)
 Although India has an upper hand compared to Pakistan, there is no need to be very happy with it
 1990 or 2011 ke bich pakistan main sthir mulyon par vaastavik prati vyakti aay main kareeb 50 fisadi or bharat main 170 fisadi kii vruddhi hui
 But in most cases there is no fundamental difference in social indicators (initially some cases were in favor of India, but some in favor of Pakistan)
 anya sandarbhon jaise tikaakaran daron main bharat kii tulana main pakistan main adhik sudhaar dikhaa
 India's rank in terms of per capita income has improved, coming from fourth (after Bhutan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) to third position (after Bhutan and Sri Lanka)
 prati vyakti aay main badhotaree kii dar main bharat is samooh main sheersh sthaan par he (jaisaa ki duniya main deshon ke adhikansh samoohon ke saath he)
 But in most other cases India's rank has fallen considerably
 1990 kii avadhi main dakshin asia main keval ek desh tha (srilanka) jiske saamaajik sanketakon kii sthiti bharat se behatar thi, lekin aaj bharat zyaadaatar deshon se neeche ludhak gaya he or sirf ek desh se upar he—pakistan se
 Comparative results of South Asia are generally ignored in developmental studies, especially in India
 phir bhi dakshin asia ke sabhi ayaamon par najar daalane par hamen bahut kuch seekhney kaa mauka mil saktaa he
 For example, for experts advocating the use of the private sector for schooling in India in the name of development, it is important to know that there is no private school anywhere in Sri Lanka that stands far ahead of India in terms of social indicators especially schooling
 And it was prohibited there since the 1960s
 yah bhi kaabile gaur he ki srilanka main “kuch hi log aise hai jinaki rihaaish se najdiki swasthya centre kii duuri 1
 4 km away
 ” padosi deshon kii kai nitiyon or uplabdhiyon par bhartiya yojanakaaron or bhartiya janata ko gaur karnaa chahie
 While South Asian comparisons are not well-received in India, the group of other countries generally considered its 'friend group' is Gyaru Brazil, Russia, India, and China (known as BRIC countries)
 in rashtron kii kuch visheshtaayen samaan hai, jaise unki vishaal aabaadi
 India is indeed an exception in this group
 jaise, is samooh ke har desh main kam umr ke aayu samoohon main purna sakshartaa hasil kar lee gai he yaa hone vaali he
 But India has still not been able to fully strengthen this developmental infrastructure: in 2006 a fifth of all Indian men in the age group of 15–24 and a fourth of women in the same group were unable to read and write
 isi tarah, bharat ko chhodkar har brick desh main bal tikaakaran lagbhag har kisi ko ho chukaa he
 Actually we have already seen that India's vaccination rate is much lower than other South Asian countries including Bangladesh and Nepal
 bacchon main kuposhan ke sambandh main bhi bharat kaaphi pichhadaa hua he
 In other BRIC countries, this terrible problem has almost been solved
 lekin bharat main ab bhi isaki vikaraal jaden faili hui he jahaan paanch varsh se kam aayu ke sabhi bacchon main kareeb 40 fisadi kaa vajan umr ke anusaar apekshit vajan se kam he or usase bhi zyada anupaat main aise bachche hai (kareeb 50 fisadi) jinka uchit shaareerik vikaas nahin ho paata he
 This pattern reflects to some extent the fact that India is still much poorer than other BRIC countries: India's per capita GDP (adjusted for 'purchasing power parity') is one-third that of Brazil and that of China
 Less than half and less than one-quarter from Russia
 saaf he ki is vishaal antar ko paatane ke liye bahut kaam karne kii jarurat he
 Just 'equals' with respect to per capita income will not succeed
 bharat main pichley 20 varshon ke dauraan aarthik manch par hue tej vikaas ne bacchon ke kuposhan kii bhayaavah sthiti ko sudhaarney yaa bal tikaakaran dar main vruddhi karne kii disha main kuch khaas uplabdhi nahin hasil kii
 Similarly, for parents to be able to send their children to school, a faster and decisive change for everyone's literacy is more important than waiting for the increase in per capita income
 ‘barabari karnaa’ sirf prati vyakti aay se nahin judaa, balki usase bhi mahatvapurn saarvajanik sevaaon, saamaajik sahyog or aarthik vitaran kii ore ishaara karata he
 Given the problems faced by schools in government schools, it is understandable why analysts say that education should be privatized
 par sawaal he ki yah kathith behatar vikalp kitna vyaavhaarik he? privet skool vikalp to dete hai par aisa vikalp, jo kisi bhi tarah se us bhoomika ko nahin nibhaa saktaa jiske liye sarkari skool bane hai or jo bhoomika unhone duniya ke adhiktar deshon main shiksha main badlaav laane ke liye nibhaai he
 a big problem is to keep the expenses of education within the means of everyone because a large part of the fees are related to the profits of private schools
 yah vikalp bharat main garib pariwaron or vanchit samudaayon ke bacchon ko skool main bhartee hone or padhgaye kaa avasar nahin detaa
 The second thing is that if the problem of spending is solved somehow (by a system like aided private schools or by the government giving school vouchers) then there are other problems also
 skool kii padhai main hameshaa jaankaree kii simaaen to rahati hai, khaskar pehali baar skool jane vaale bacchon ke mata-pita ke liye
 Apart from this, school officials or private school runners also have a lot more information than the parents of the students that they can give or want to give
 yah vauchar pratha lagu karne ke liye upyukt maahaul katai nahin he
 The third thing is that due to lack of competition, as is often seen in villages in India, private schools become machines to collect big money in exchange for very ordinary education
 schuli shiksha ke maamle main bazaar ko chalaae rakhane ke liye spardhaa kii bhoomika ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Many meaningful efforts are being made to expand the scope of non-government schools by charging only nominal fees for running the school
 lekin bharat main shiksha ke kshetra main privet skulon ke taaja anubhav samarpit safalataa or paisa kamaane kii mashin, donon kii sahi misaal pesh karte hai
 Their criticism often proves that they do not fulfill what they say
 jaisaa ki pehle bataaya ja chukaa he, bharat main privet skulon kaa pradarshan chaatro kii ausat safalataa kii drushti se sarkari skulon se behatar nahin dikhaai detaa
 This indicates that there is no simple solution accessible here
 privet skulon par adhik nirbharta kaa paroksh nuksaan shaayad yah he ki ve sarkari skulon se un mata-pita ke bacchon ko khinch lete hai jo aisi aalochana or maang sabase zyada kar sakate hai or jo sarkari skulon ko sabase jimmedaar or javabdeh bana sakati hai
 Relying on private schools can exacerbate the problems of government schools as they give way to more articulate and more families stricken with low levels of education in government schools
 privet skool bharat main schuli shiksha kii tasviir kaa hissaa to avashya rahane vaale hai lekin sarkari skulon main bade paimaane par sudhaar karne or un par bharosa karne kii aavashyaktaa sirf isliye khatm nahin hone vaali ki jo log kharch uthaa sakate hai, unke liye privet skool kaa vikalp he
 Fraud of healthcare is the way out of the health sector crisis which is probably the biggest challenge facing India today? The challenges are big, but instead of being frightened by their radiance, we should find ways and means to overcome this challenge
 iske liye hamen is sankat main yogadan karne vaale karkon ke vishleshan or usase kareeb se jude un sabkon par bhi gaur karnaa chahie jo in samasyaon se behatar dhang se nibatane vaale duusare vikasshil deshon ke anubhavon se nikle hai
 There is much to be learned from the better performance of Indian states (especially Tamil Nadu and Kerala) which have taken better care of their public health than the rest of India
 jahaan tak baaki duniya kaa sawaal he bharat ko tatkaal sabak de sakane vaale deshon main sabase ahm sthaan china kaa he lekin brazil, mexico or thailand jaise desh bhi is suchi main shaamil hai
 Perhaps the first and foremost need is to understand the importance of resolving equal facilities for all in the overall concept of healthcare for the entire country
 thailand, brazil or mexico ne haal ke varshon main yah mukaam hasil kiya he or apni janata ke liye swasthya seva kii pahunch kaa swaroop puri tarah badal diya he
 China's experience is particularly interesting, because it first tried in 1979 to deny the need for a resolution of economic reform and to reverse the old tradition of equal convenience for all
 china ne dderghaayu or saamaanya swasthya kii drushti se is badlaav kii badi baari keemat chukaai
 Ultimately, he quickly adopted the resolve of the mistake hidden in this denial and the same facility for everyone since 2004 (china has reached the 95 percent target) and benefited from it
 china ke tathakthith prashansak akasar vakaalat karte hai ki bharat china kaa anusaran kare haalanki ve yah jaanate hi nahin ki china kya karata he
 China has not left the proliferation of healthcare in the hands of private health insurance
 isamen sarkaar kii bhoomika bahut badi he
 All these experiences are completely in line with our expectations on the basis of economic reasoning, especially (1) the sense of 'public health' inherent in public health, (2) the role of integrated information, and (3) health in a community or country
 Because of the effect of inequality on achieving a normal level
 sabake liye swasthya seva sulabh karaane ke sankalp ke liye bharat ke samooche swasthya seva tantra main kam se kam do pahaluon main bada badlaav laana hoga
 First of all, we have to come out of this confusion that the shift from poor health to good health in India can be achieved easily by private healthcare and insurance, because all the facts are against this thinking
 duniyabar main adhiktar swasthya seva tantron main kisi na kisi rup main privet sevaaon kii gunjaaish rakhi jaati he or bharat ko yah parampara todgaye kii koi thos vajah nahin he
 Accountability issues and other challenges cannot be ignored while making health plans in India that affect the operation of the government sector, including the government system of healthcare
 iske baavjood keemat chukaane kii kshamta ho yaa na ho (jise bhore samiti ne varshon pehle sabake liye swasthya seva ke prasar kaa mul siddhant bataaya tha) samaaj ke sabhi sadasyon ke liye swasthya sevaayen sulabh karaane or achche swasthya kii anya jaruratein puri karnaa puri tarah sarkaar kii jimmedaari he
 Apart from this, the government system of health services has a fundamental role in achieving the goal of making healthcare accessible to all, given the market system and private insurance limits in the case of healthcare
 iske baad bharat main prastaavit niti ke tahat jis duusare pahalu main badlaav kii jarurat he, vah swasthya seva, rokthaam or upachaar, donon tarah kii suvidhaon kii sarkari vyavastha main buniyadi niyamon ko phir se apnaane kii aavashyaktaa main nihit he
 It requires renewed attention to primary health centers, village-level health workers, preventive health measures and other means of regular healthcare
 garib pariwaron ke liye riyayati dar par swasthya bime kii nai rashtriya swasthya beemaa yojana maanviya kaarykram he
 The need for public participation is particularly high in prevention efforts rather than cure of diseases
 inamen tikaakaran, swatchta, jan-swatchta, kachra niptaan, rog nigaraanee, machhar niyantran, swasthya shiksha, khaadya suraksha niyaman or takneekee bhashaa main janaswasthya se judi tamaam gatividhiyaan shaamil hai
 Pir is mountain-like, should be melted
 There is no lack of complaints and protests in India today
 lekin jaananaa yah hoga ki kya cheekh-pukaar machaane vaale or rajnatik rup se taqatvar virodhon se un vanchanaaon or anyaayon kii samuchit jhlak milti he jinase bharat kii suvidhavihin aabaadi nirantar trast he
 Relatively rich Indians, who may not be rich but whose income and standard of living are above the common Indian, become a hindrance in the path of attention given to the real poor
 iskaa nateeja akasar yahi hota he ki anek rajnatik muddon main bharat ke behad vanchit logon kii bahusankhya ko lagbhag koi jagah nahin milti
 By excluding the disadvantaged sections, their interests in public policy have always been neglected
 bharat kii yojana main schuli shiksha, swasthya seva, saamaajik suraksha or sambhddha maamalon kii upeksha is dharre kaa ek pahalu he
 The inclination of public policy towards the interests of the affluent classes can take many forms
 isamen kheti or gramin vikaas kii upeksha, nijee swaarth ke liye paryaavaran kii lut ko badhaava dena or sampann virgon par sarkari sabsidi pratyaksh or paroksh rup main lutaanaa shaamil he
 This multidimensional inequality gives him the means to continue, and this is especially so by distorted public debate and media coverage
 itane bade saamaajik vibhaajan ke saath vibhinn samoohon kii aawaaj or takat main badi asamanta judi rahati he
 Apart from this, it also hides the horrific picture of deprivation of the weaker sections of the society through distorted media coverage and public debate which basically nurtures the interests of that large and vibrant population
 behisaab kashton ke hone or unki vikaraalata par padaa andhere kaa paradaa itnaa ghanaa he ki mukhar netaaon se tatkaal samarthan milane kii aam aadmi kii apeksha ko hi ekadam nai paribhaasha mil gai he
 Less affluent than real rich, but relatively affluent people often think of themselves as common people
 unhen yah galatfahami ho jaati he ki ve samaaj ke vanchit hisse hai or yah baat sirf tabhi sahi ho sakati he jab ham unki tulana vaastavik amiron kii upree parat se karenge
 George Lindsay Johnstone, an early officer of the East India Company, spoke very deeply in Parliament in London in 1801 that Britain's empire in India is an empire of thought and it stands at the foundation of India's refusal to recognize its power
 apni takat ko pahchaanane main aam bharatiyon kii anakani jonstone ke jamaane main british hukumat ke saamne bharat kii gulaami jari rahane kii pramukh vajah thi
 To some extent, due to the political situation of India, it is still true today that unprivileged Indians are hesitant to wake up and demand to be released quickly and forever from this extraordinary deception
 tathakthith aam aadmi kahalaane vaale, sabase sampann na sahi phir bhi apekshaakrit sampann logon kii shikaayatein joardaar dhang se uchhaali jaati hai
 In contrast, in Indian society, relatively little attention has been paid to the long-standing tremendous deprivation of genuinely weaker sections
 is sabake baavjood bharat kii loktantric raajnneeti sabase vanchit deshavaasiyon ko apni shakti ko pahchaanane or yah maang karne ke avasar detii he ki desh kii itani vishaal aabaadi kaa jivan barbaad karne vaali behad ahm asamantaaon ko jaldi se jaldi dur kiya jaae
 Although it is a matter of political organization to some extent, it is also very important to clearly understand the spread and specific nature of deprivation and inequality in India

 Rahul Gandhi's sudden departure abroad during a crucial session of Parliament is a bad news for this party of about one and a half year old
 jis netaa se ummid thi ki uske sir par party kaa taj sajega or jo ise bure dinon kii chaaya se bachaayegaa, vah khud hi chuttee par chalaa gaya
 But the truth is that such a move was not expected from Rahul Gandhi, it would also be wrong to say
 rahul ne party ke kaamkaaj main kabhi puri tarah se dilchaspee nahin dikhaai or na hi kabhi apni takat kaa pradarshan kiya
 Many times he felt that he would do many new things like a revolutionary and give a new direction to the party
 party kii sampurna paraajay ke baad to unase ummiden bad gai thim
 But he did not do or say anything that would be thought that he would revive this desperate party
 party main unki sthiti majboot to thi lekin haar ke baad sonia gandhi ke salaahkaaron ne jis tarah se unki nahin chalane di usase yah lagane laga ki vah naakhush hai or party main puri tarah se badlaav karnaa chaahate hai
 Obviously, they did not get permission for this
 party main saaf taur se do dhade ho gaye
 Khurrat and old leaders of the party were not allowing him to walk
 chunaav ke pehle bhi unke kai priy paatro kii unke padon se chuttee kar di gai thi
 Rahul wanted the party to be completely redesigned and new faces given space
 aisa lagata he ki unki yah baat nahin maani gai
 It seems that party president Sonia Gandhi also refused to accept his views as she saw the threat of rebellion in the party
 congress main puraane banaam nae kii ladaai koi nai nahin
 Rahul Gandhi's grandmother Indira Gandhi also fought this battle and eliminated the old guard in the party
 nizlingappa or kamraj ke netritv main old guard ne tab indira gandhi ko baandh sa diya tha lekin unhone badi chaturaai se party par kabja kar liya
 He was a master of political foresight and understanding
 lekin rahul aisa kuch kar paane kii sthiti main nahin dikh rahe hai
 He is living indifferently and could not be rooted in the party
 itnaa hi nahin unke ird-gird chapaluson kii puri fouj he jo unhen apane vivek se kaam nahin karne de rahi he
 Along with them there are people whose politics is merely a means to establish themselves
 aise logon kii suchi lambii he or durbhagyavash rahul unke kareeb hai
 Among them, there are a large number of leaders who have stayed away from electoral politics and fill the politics of statements
 aisa nahin he ki sonia gandhi ke paas aise log nahin hai lekin rahul ko aise logon se chhutkaaraa paanaa hi hoga
 Because of the people who are around him, he cannot expect a big return to India's politics
 baharhaal ab sawaal he ki congress is mahatvapurn satr main apane tevar kaise dikhaaegi? choti-choti partiyaan congress kaa vikalp banakar sansad main apni upasthiti jataa rahi hai
 It remains to be seen how the party's masters take steps now

 co / 4s5szykjon pichley dinon bhaajapa ke saath sambandh tanaavpurn hone ke baavjood jadyu bihar vidhansabha chunaav uske saath milakar ladega
 Party President Sharad Yadav said that our alliance with BJP is very old
 ham gathbandhan main rahakar chunaav ladenge or siton kaa talmail kar liya jayega
 Along with this, he called the media speculation of reports of differences between the two parties regarding seat sharing
 yadav bhaajapa kii aguwai vaale rajg ke sanyojak bhi hai lekin unhone bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke ek saath chunaav prachaar karne ke bare main puche gaye prashnon ko taal diya
 Asked about the Patna High Court ordering a CBI inquiry in connection with alleged malfunctions in various welfare schemes, including the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Yadav said he would react only after reading the verdict
 france ke raashtrapati emanuel maikron pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath aadhyatmik rajdhani varanasi ke daure par hai
 Both leaders will enjoy the Ganga Aarti here, besides boating in the Ganges

 At the same time, all the ghats falling between eighty to Dashashwamedh Ghat have been decorated
 banaras vaasiyon kii baat karen, to unako is baat kii ummid he ki unke saansad or france ke raashtrapati kii dosti or unka varanasi daura banaras ke vikaas ko nayaa aayam degaa
 Significantly, French President Emmanuel Macron is in India on a four-day tour

 This is not the first time that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take the President of another country to Varanasi

 Mehbooba Mufti, chief of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the main opposition party in Jammu and Kashmir, on Thursday alleged that Chief Minister Omar Abdullah's recent announcement of limited withdrawal of the Turbulent Areas Act from Jammu and Kashmir has led to extreme confusion and its price
 Common citizens have to pay
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ke vibhinn ghatakon ke bich talmail ke abhaav sthiti badtar hoti ja rahi he or aisa jaan padataa he ki ghoshnaa hone ke baad hi bahes hone lagi
 "it seems that the Chief Minister did not do his homework before showing haste to announce the proposed withdrawal of AFSPA," Mufti said

 The trailer of director Kundan Shah's upcoming film 'P to PM' has arrived
 yah kahani he ek veshya kii, jiskaa role nibhaa rahi hai south kii actress minakshi dikshit
 The film is a political drama filled with serious issues as well as laughter jokes
 kahani ek veshya kii he jo 4 dinon ke bheetar 200 rupee se mukhyamantri ban jaati he
 The film also has a 17-minute dead body scene which according to the news is quite funny
 kuch dinon pehle 'darty politics' bani thi or priyanka chopra ke production main 'madam ji' bhi banane vaali thi, jo ab nahin ban rahi
 The story of these two films looks somewhat similar to 'P to PM Tak'
 minakshi dikshit ke alaava bharat jadhav or yashpal sharma film main ahm bhoomika main hai
 The film will be released on 29 May 2015
 dekhen trailor The petition seeking to link the Aadhaar card with the property documents sought from the Center and the Delhi government in two weeks
 The Delhi High Court filed its reply in two weeks with the central government and the Delhi government on a petition seeking to link the Aadhar card with the property documents
 Is said to court ne yachikakarta ko is maamle main yuidiai ko bhi party banane ke nirdesh die
 This petition has been filed by BJP leader and spokesperson Ashwini Upadhyay
 isse pehle soshal media acount ko aadhaar card se link karne kii yachika ko supreme court ne khaarij kar diya
 The Supreme Court has asked to go to the Madras High Court
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) netaa or vakil ashvini kumaar upaadhyaay kii ore se daakhil yachika main kaha gaya tha ki aadhaar se soshal media acounts jode jane se dupliket, phek or ghost acount par lagaam kasi ja sakegaa
 Simultaneously, the petitioner has demanded the Supreme Court to direct the Central Government, Election Commission and Press Council of India to ban fake news and paid news
 is maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne kaha ki koi bhi maamla hamaare saamne naa laaen, yah maamla madras hoicourt main chal rahaa he to vahiin jaaen
 Former Bihar Health Minister Tej Pratap Yadav said that in politics he imitates his father RJD President Lalu Yadav, not Prime Minister Narendra Modi (narendra Modi)
 tejpratap ne shanivaar ko yah bhi mana kii unhen ghar dilaane main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar(nitish Kumar) ne madad kii
 When asked about the help of Nitish Kumar in relation to his house, Tej Pratap said that i have a personal relationship with him and have a relationship with all the leaders
 vah khud bhi vidhansabha ke sadsy hai
 All legislators get home
 unhen nahin mila tha jo ab mil gaya he
 Earlier, news came that Tej Pratap Yadav had called Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for his house and said that uncle will not get home
 But when asked about the absence of senior party leaders while listening to the problems of the people in the party office, Tej Pratap Yadav said that the election season is all busy
 party ke bihar ikai ke adhyaksh ramchandra purve ke bare main unhone kaha ki vah philhal dilli main apana ilaaj kara rahe hai
 However, Tej Pratap Yadav, who is believed to have increased political activity at the behest of his maternal uncles Sadhu Yadav and Subhash Yadav
 is par unhone safaai di ki vah naa mamaa naa chachaa naa mausa naa mausi kisi kaa nahin sunate
 Only listen to your guru
 unhone kaha ki mamaa koi party main hai ki unke kehane se party chalegaa
 CRPF jawan died on Friday in Budgam district of Kashmir
 aisa bataaya ja rahaa he ki humhama ilaake main ardhasanya bal ke prashikshan centre main hawaldaar anil kumaar apane kamare main aaj subah mrit paaya gaya
 His colleagues were the first to see
 police ne jawan kii maut kii vajah kaa pataa lagane ke liye jaanch shuru kar di he
 Earlier, Lieutenant Omar Fayaz had met a young officer who had come home to the burials after being kidnapped and shot dead by militants in Shopian district, causing angry people to demand action against the killers
 yuva adhikari yahaan ek shaadi samaaroh main shaamil hone aayaa tha
 Officials said 22-year-old Lieutenant Omar Fayaz, resident of Surasona village in Kulgam district, had gone to attend his maternal uncle's wedding in Batpura, about 74 km from here
 beeti raat kareeb das bajetankwaadiyon neunaka apharan kar liya
 Family members did not inform the police or the army about the kidnapping of the unarmed military officer, as the militants had threatened to do so
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki goliyon se chalni unka shav buudhvaar kii subah harman ilaake main unke ghar se kareeb teen kilometre dur mila
 The autopsy has revealed traces on his body indicating that he had resisted suspected militants who abducted him
 unhen behad kareeb se goli maari gai or goliyaan unke sir, pet or seene main lagi hai
 Kashmir will have to stand up, for its sons, Lieutenant General Krishna said that the people of Kashmir will have to stand collectively and retaliate against the perpetrators and cowards of heinous crime
 unhone kaha ki ve apane sapooton ke dukhad nuksaan ko ab or bardaasht nahin kar sakate
 Many days have passed since the election results, but still the government does not seem to be formed in Maharashtra
 uski vajah he ki shivasena or BJP jinhone milakar chunaav ladaa or ab aapas main hi ulajh gaye hai
 The point is that the Shiv Sena is adamant that a formula was decided between Amit Shah and Uddhav Thackeray that if the Shiv Sena and the BJP form a government, then the Shiv Sena and the BJP for two and a half years should rule
 darasal shivasena aditya thakare ko jo ki uddhav thakare ke bete hai or thakare parivaar ke pehle aise vyakti hai jinhone chunaav ladaa he, unako mukhyamantri bananaa chaahati he lekin abhi tak is par baat ban nahin pai he
 Let us also tell you that in 2014, Shiv Sena and BJP fought separate elections
 haalanki bahuton ko yah yaad nahin he
 The second thing is that the Shiv Sena has played the role of opposition in a way even while in government for the last five years
 aksar shivasena apane mukhpatr saamana ke jariye BJP or modi sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhti rahi he jabaki usee saamana main sharad pavaar kii jamkar taareef hoti rahi he
 Especially after the election, Shiv Sena leaders were quite ahead of those who congratulated Pawar
 sharad pavaar ke bhi bal thakare se hameshaa se achche rishte rahe hai jise pavaar parivaar ne kabhi nahin chipaaya
 So is it believed that if Pawar supports Shiv Sena in such a situation, then the Congress will also support this alliance in compulsion even if it is part of this alliance or not
 ye baat isliye kahi ja rahi he ki congress ke netaa or maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan iskaa sandesh de chuke hai
 The attitude of Nawab Malik and Praful Patel of NCP is also soft towards Shiv Sena
 jab shivasena ke netaa rajyapal se milane gaye the uske baad sanjay raut pavaar se mili
 It is obvious that when two political leaders meet, there are talks of politics
 ye bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki shivasena ab yadi peeche hatati he to usko raajnneetik nuqasaan hoga, uski chhavi par asar padegaa ki shivasena kuch karti nahin he keval dhamkee detii he
 His teeth are only to show
 shivasena ko yadi paripati bananaa he to usko BJP kii parchaai se baahar aana hoga, aisa bade log maanate hai
 Many people believe that if the NCP and Shiv Sena come together in such a situation, they will have a figure of 110 while for the majority they need 127 mlas as the Congress will be absent from voting, for this 13 mlas are needed while the independents and mlas of small parties The number is 27
 to kya pavaar kuch aisa kar sakate hai? jitne bhi log pavaar ko jaanate hai unka maananaa he ki ye sambhav he
 a second alternative is also being discussed whether BJP and NCP can come together? Many people believe that this can happen
 isaki vajah he ED yani pravartan nideshaalay jo sharad pavaar, ajit pavaar or prafull patel ke peeche padi hui he
 So can Pawar join BJP to avoid it? Anything can happen in politics but the biggest thing is why after all the BJP is avoiding the formula of 50-50, that means BJP should rule for two and a half years and Shiv Sena for two and a half years
 isaki vajah yah he ki itihaas main aise sabhi prayog asafal rahe hai
 Mayawati and Kalyan Singh did not run the government in Uttar Pradesh, Kumaraswamy and Congress governments did not run in Karnataka and recently Mehbooba Mufti and BJP governments did not run in Kashmir
 kya yahi vajah he ki BJP shivasena ke saath 50-50 ke formule se bachanaa chaahati he
 Whatever be the case, but the people of Maharashtra have elected a new government and they have the right to form a government that starts working for them because many parts of Maharashtra are still raining heavily and the condition of the people is bad
 ye vaqt raajnneeti ke liye nahin he
 The Shiv Sena and the BJP should sit together and resolve their quarrels
 nahin to jaisaa ki supriya sule jo ki sharad pavaar kii beti hai or baraamati se saansad bhi hai, unhone kaha ki yadi BJP or shivasena apana kaam nahin karegi to janata ke hit ke liye hamen hi kuch karnaa padegaa
 His gesture is clear and all Maharashtra political parties should understand this gesture
 rajdhani dilli main shanivaar ko dilli ke sarkari skulon main ek hajaar classroom kaa shilanyas samaaroh kaarykram yojit kiya gaya
 During this, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal targeted the BJP and said that do patriotism or Modi devotion
 new frends colony main hue is kaarykram main siem arvind kejariwal, upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya, vidhayachamanatulla khansamet schuli bachche or bacchon ke mata-pita maujuud the
 During the program, CM Kejriwal claimed that not all schools in all the states across the country are going to form the Delhi government
 4 saal main 21 hajaar classroom ban jaaenge
 Meaning 1000 new schools are going to be built, while there are already 24 thousand classrooms in 1100 government schools
 ye sarkaar rocket kii speed main kaam karti he, hamane 500 skool banane kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin ab 1000 skool bana die hai
 Also, CM Kejriwal said that these schools are good, the children of our mlas have given their certificates here by taking admission in them
 privet skool se behatar nattejey ab sarkari skool ke aa rahe hai
 350 children studying in Delhi government got admission in IIT
 sabhi mata-pita kaa seenaa 59 inch kaa ho gaya
 Which left 56 inches behind
 dilli ke siem ke mutabik, happines class main bacchon ko deshbhakt banane kii shiksha di jaati he
 No one coming from Pakistan and America will cure the country
 aisi shiksha kaa phayda nahin he jo berogari paidaa kare
 During this, CM Kejriwal took a dig at the central government and said that there was a lot of hurdle by the central government in making these new classrooms in Delhi
 centre sarkaar vaale sari file mangava lete hai
 To decide whether you love Modi ji or your children
 modi ji ne ek bhi skool banaakar nahin diya
 You people should be patriotic or Modi devotion
 unhone dilli kii janata se vaada karte hue kaha ki aapse nivedan he ki pichley vidhansabha chunaav main jis tarah 70 main se 67 siten AAP ko di
 Similarly, to win 7 seats in this Lok Sabha election
 kaarykram main maujuud upmukhyamantrimanish sisodiyane kaha ki 12 hajaar 748 kamare is saal dilli sarkaar banaaegi, jabaki 11000 classroom banane kaa kaam aaj se shuru ho rahaa he
 At the same time, the Deputy Chief Minister claimed that schools and bridges are being built in Delhi because sincere work is being done now
 4 saal main 8 hajaar classroom or 25 skool ban chuke hai
 Further 31 schools are being built
 kaarykram main aae bacchon ko manish sisodiya ne kaha ki apane ghar jaakar mummy-papa ko dhanyavad kahana kyonki unhone aam aadmi party ko chunaa, arvind kejariwal ko mukhyamantri or mujhe shiksha mantri banaaya(yahaan jaldbaaji main sisodiya khud ko 'mukhyamantri' bol gaye, phir turant sudhaar bhi kar diya
 ) He further said that the politics of temple-mosque is taking place in the country and to build schools in Delhi
 raajnneeti ko shiksha se nahi joda to in skulon ko bawarchikhana bana denge
 It is necessary to support Arvind Kejriwal, weddings will be done instead of studying in schools if we do not stay or become weak
 unhone vaada kiya ki main aise skool aise banavaayuungaa jaise apana ghar banavaa rahaa hum
 It is said that people are ready to go to any extent in love and perhaps something similar happened with a Spanish blonde and a girl from Bihar
 is kahani main spain kii ek ladki ek bihari ladke se shaadi karne ke liye saat samandar paar bihar chali ai
 Islave Story's hero Akhilesh and heroine from Farbisganj area of araria is Sara Rios from Spain

 The case of a Dalit man being beaten to death in Rajkot, Gujarat, was still not resolved that the case of two youths being beaten up by villagers and paraded with naked clothes came to light
 jaankaree ke mutabik, donon yuvakon ko ek pratimaa ke stand par apshabd likhane ko lekar maaraa pita gaya

 Shraddha has not confirmed whether Aditya Roy Kapur has gifted Shraddha Kapoor an engagement ring or not, but yes, she has definitely lifted the curtain that there is no one else to recommend her to Vishal Bhardwaj for 'haider' but His co star was Shahid Kapoor
 shraddha ne kaha, ‘’jab shahid ne mujhe bataaya ki vah vishaal kii koi film kar rahaa he to mujhe laga mujhe bhi yah film kerani he
 True, i was so dying for this film that i pressurized Shahid to introduce me to Vishal
 meri bhaawanaaon kii kadra karte hue na sirf shahid ne vishaal sar se meri baat kii balki meraa audishan bhi fiks karavaaya
 i still remember during the audition that Vishal sir told me that he is going to give me a lot of stress and i happily accepted all his things

 Significantly, Shraddha, who was praised for 'aashiqui 2' and 'ek Villain', considers herself a part of the supporting cast of 'haider'
 ve kahati hai, ‘’haidar’ shahid kii film he

 Shraddha's performance, especially in the intimate scenes between Shahid and Shraddha, has strengthened 'haider', but was there any dilemma in Shraddha's mind about these scenes? 'if i had any such problem in my mind, i would not have done such scenes, but with the experience and caring nature of Shahid, Vishal sir has beautifully shot these scenes which looks quite romantic
 haa, yah main aapako jarur bataanaa chaahuungi ki is seen ke dauraan main kaaphi nervas thi lekin vishaal sar ne jis sahanshakti ke saath is drishy ko shoot kiya vah kaabile tarif he

 Let me tell you that Team India had to face its biggest embarrassment under the captaincy of Sourav Ganguly
 tab 29 oktober saal 2000 ke din bhi bhartiya team srilanka ke khilaaf sharajah maidan par utari thi
 Sri Lanka batting first scored 299 runs in 50 overs, in which opener Jayasuriya scored 189 runs
 jawaab main bhartiya team 26
 He was piled on for 54 runs in 3 overs

 (@iam_zaid) December 10, 2017 Both these shame came in 1986 and 1978
 teesri sharmindagi ke tahat bharat 24 disambar 1986 ko srilanka ke khilaaf kanpur main 78 par hi dher ho gaya tha
 It is still India's lowest ODI score on its own land , while in 1978, the Indian team was dismissed for 79 against Pakistan in Sialkot on October 13
 lekin ek samay 54 se pehle dher hoti dikhaai pad rahe rohit ke ranbankure dhoni ke ravayai ke kaaran sabase badi hi nahin, balki chaaron sharmindagiyon se saaf batch gaye

 But if he had married a Dalit girl, his luck would have awakened and he would have become the Prime Minister
 ' unhone tanj karne ke lahaze main kaha ki modi or baba ramdev rahul kii tarah majaburi main fakir nahin bane hai
 Ramdev said, 'poor fate is bad
 uski mummy kahati hai ki agar tum videshi ladki se shaadi karoge to pradhanmantri nahin ban paaoge or vah deshi ladki se shaadi nahin karnaa chahta
 His mother wants him to become the Prime Minister first and then bring a foreign girl

 Whether it is blatantly against Pakistan or stern action to stop the growing moves of Islamic fundamentalism in her country, Hasina has taken a political risk to save the secular and liberal character of the Bangladeshi politics

 He has sought the support of mps on the bill brought in the country for mid-term elections on December 12
 650 saansadon vaale house of comons main pradhanmantri johnson kaa shuruaati prastaav gir gaya kyonki iske paksh main do tihaai bahumat nahin jute paaya
 Soon after, he put forward a proposal to enact a law to hold elections on 12 December
 ise paarit karaane ke liye sansad main unhen saadhaaran bahumat kii jarurat hogi
 Amidst this upsurge, Johnson told the mps that 'now Parliament cannot hold the country hostage for a long time

 - input IANS Shiv Shashank Chandrasekhar Upadhyay, one of the founding members of the 'hindi Hitrakshak Samiti' and former Special Officer of the Uttarakhand Government, has claimed that information about the Hindi movement of Yogguru Baba Ramdev is incomplete in the country and only after knowing this issue One should raise it and try not to take political advantage of it
 upaadhyaay ne baba ramdev ko likhe ek patr main kaha he ki yah durbhaagya he ki spasht rup se kareeb 30 ucch vishyon main hindi madhyam se pariksha or padhai kaa aadesh ho jane ke baad bhi ramdev ke manch se inhi vishyon ke liye hindi madhyam kii maang kii ja rahi he
 He has written that it seems that this movement is being ignored by the people who had brought Hindi to a stage by running the movement with their blood sweat
 upaadhyaay ne likhaa he ki baba ramdev kaa vishesh daayitv banataa he ki vah hindi ke bare main jin gumnaam andolankariyon dwaara pehle hi safalataa hasil kii ja chuki he, uske bare main rajnatik laabh uthaane kii koshish ke bajaay unki safalataa ko or adhik pukhta karen taaki desh main hindi ko or mahatv pradaan kiya ja sake
 He told that when Hindi movement was done about 20 years ago, after that long movement, Hindi language was made an alternate medium for the first time in engineering, medical science, law, m
ed and MBA (management) and some other higher courses in the country
 i went
 unhone bataaya ki is silsile main sarkari aadesh bhi jari ho chukaa he or kai logon ne hindi main parikshaayen bhi di hai
 Upadhyay said in his letter that at least it was not expected from Baba Ramdev's movement that Hindi people who have created history in this country will be ignored under a well-planned politics and suppress reality
 Will be given
 unhone kaha ki acha hota ki hindi ke is abhiyaan main baba ramdev in andolanon kii purna jaankaree hasil kar lete tathaa is disha main jo kaary apurna rah gaya he uske bare main hi aawaaj uthaate, lekin baba ne aisa nahin kiya
 Upadhyay said that instead of traumatizing the wounds of Hindivirs who were immersed in the darkness of anonymity, Ramdev should have raised a concern about further enhancing the prestige of Hindi in his movement
 unhone baba ramdev ko yaad dilaate huye patr main likhaa he, ‘maine aaj se kareeb saat varsh purv vyaktigat rup se aapke haridwar ke kankhal sthit ashram main sampark kar hindi andolan ke bare main puri jaankaree di thi or aagrah kiya tha ki jo kaary adhure rah gayi hai use puraa kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa he
 Upadhyay said that those who are in favor of Hindi language with Baba Ramdev, after getting a thorough knowledge of them, do constructive work to raise their voice about completing the task which has remained incomplete till now
 Want unhone baba ramdev ko aise logon se bachane kii salaah dete huye kaha ki hindi kii pratishtha ko or adhik badhaane ke liye eemaandaar prayaas kiye jane chaiye na ki sirf rajnatik uddeshy yaa vaahvahee luutane ke liye aawaaj uthaani chaiye
 While giving special information about the Hindi movement to Baba Ramdev, Upadhyay said that in the then Hindi movement Mukesh Jain, Dr
 munishwar, pushpendra chouhan, bhanu pratap singh, vinod gautam, ajay malik, shyamruddh pathak tathaa anya kai yoddhaon ne apane jaan kii baaji tak laga di thi
 He told that Pushpendra Chauhan had jumped from the audience gallery in Parliament and his ribs were broken
 unhone dilli main shastri bhawan ke saamne kai dinon tak anshan bhi kiya tha
 Upadhyay has written in his letter that the fiery movement of Hindi started from Rudki in Uttarakhand in the year 1980 and by the year 2009, the situation has become that except for only nine special examinations of the country, the remaining can also be given examination in Hindi language
 , Such an order has been done
 yahaan tak ki ab sanyukt sainya pariksha (sidies) bhi hindi main di ja sakati he
 He said that the movement of Hindi usually started from literature and passed through grammar and pronunciation and ended at the prize mansion
 unhone kaha ki aise kathith andolankariyon kaa sahi myne main hindi kii badahaali se koi sarokaar nahin rahata he
 'kabira Khatta demands everyone's good in the market, friendship with neither Kahu nor hate with Kahu
 'bahut pehle kabir ne ye doha banaras ke bazaar main khadaa hokar kaha tha
 But then they may have had the feeling that now that time will also come in Benares, when the waves of Ganga will also start eating in the market of politics
 kehane vaale kah rahe hai ki is baar dilli kaa rasta banaras se hokar jane vaala he
 Therefore, the listeners have made preparations to surround Banaras and Bahubali Mukhtar Ansari has become the first ladder of that preparation
 banaras kahie, varansi yaa phir kaashi
 But this is where Kabir stood in the market and raised the voice against the dominating rituals and traditions of the religion
 jaat-paat or dharm kii buraaiyon ke khilaaf kamajoro ko apane dohon ke jariye raah dikhaai thi
 Now that time will also come in Varanasi that the waves of Ganga will be surprised to see a new wave of their own standing on the strength of the political market
 ganga, dharm, siyasat or dilli16veen loksabhaa angadaai le chuki he or isamen banaras jo karegaa ab bas sabhi kii nazaren usee par gadi hai
 In such a situation, for Banaras, the opposition is the fastest in the parties
 magar bechaini sabase zyada bijepi main he, kyonki iske pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi shiv kii nagari se hokar hi dilli janaa chaahate hai
 While the rest of the party has somehow managed to cut Modi's path
 saat foot se bhi oonche lahim-shaheem bahubali makhtaar ansaari kaa banaras ke chunavi ras ko chakhne se inkaar karnaa koi yun hi nahin he
 There is a deep thought behind this
 wo soch jise amali jama pehanaane ke liye usee din kavayad shuru ho gai thi jis din aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal ko lekar shivganga express ne banaras kii raah pakadi thi
 In fact, seeing Mukhtar Ansari's report card in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, anti-modi parties had realized that if Mukhtar does not contest this time, it is certain that the vote of the Muslims of Banaras is going to go to Kejriwal's lump sum
 agar aisa ho gaya to kejariwal vahi karishma banaras main bhi doharaa sakate hai jo unhone nai dilli main kiya tha
 Where the trapped political party In 2009, Mukhtar Ansari contested the Lok Sabha election from Varanasi on a BSP ticket
 unke saamne the bijepi ke kaddavar netaa murali manohar joshi
 Mukhtar Ansari lost by just 17 thousand 87 votes in that election
 murali manohar joshi ko 2 lakh 3 hajaar 122 vot mili the jabaki mukhtaar ansaari ko ek lakh 85 hajaar 911 vot mili the
 Local MLA Ajay Rai, who is the Congress candidate from Benares this time, contested on the Samajwadi Party ticket in 2009 and finished third with one lakh 23 thousand 874 votes
 yani agar ajay raay or makhtaar ansaari kaa vot mila den to murali manohar joshi kareeb ek lakh vot peeche rahete
 And this is the only thing that anti-modi parties want to capitalize on this time
 or isamen sabase ahm bhoomika ho jaati he mukhtaar ansaari kii
 In UP, sitting MLA of Mau, Mukhtar Ansari has won the Assembly elections from Mau for 4 times
 wo bhi baari maton se
 Mukhtar Ansari also has a strong stranglehold in Banaras and the entire surrounding area, but it is not that Banaras's suspense ended with Mukhtar's refusal
 abhi isamen kuch din or lagenge
 It is not too early anyway, because the election in Benaras is the last i
e
 on 12 May
 abhi to aap ke netaa or aap kii team kaa banaras main deraa daalana baaki he
 The electoral game will start right now
 Actually, the real electoral game in Kashi will start after you camp
 khel modi ke naam par banaras ke muslim votaron ko ekajute karne kaa
 So that his vote does not get distributed among Congress, BSP or SP
 maahaul aisa bane ki banaras ke muslim votaron ko yakeen ho jaae ki kaashi main agar modi ko koi roak saktaa he to wo sirf kejariwal hai
 Mukhtar's declaration of not contesting from Benares is the first victory of the same effort
 hindutv kii cendrabhuminarendra modi ke liye bhi varanasi kii seat mahaj ek seat nahin he
 Varanasi is the heart of Purvanchal as well as the centerpiece of Hindutva
 purvanchal main loksabhaa kii 23 siten hai or mana ja rahaa he ki varanasi se modi kii ummidavaari se sabhi 23 siton par bijepi kii daavedaari ko dam mil saktaa he
 bjp's electoral strategy seems to be strong at the moment, but the party is now afraid that this master stroke of Mukhtar Ansari may not spoil the game
 darasal banaras kii phijaaon kaa asar he ki yahaan raajnneeti bhi samskruti kii ungali pakadakar chalati he
 Like the waves of the Ganges, politics here changes from moment to moment
 lekin ye badlaav hameshaa hi vyavastha main ek nai ummid kii akulaahat kaa anjaam hota he
 The political rhetoric of Modi and Kejriwal may divide the voters of Baranas, but the dependence of this city creates a fabric between the Hindus and Muslims that reaches Kabir's junky sheets
 
 yahi vajah he ki nafaraton kii patharilii ghati main bhi yahaan mohabbat ke gulabon kaa khilanaa abhi bhi rukaa nahin he
 However, despite this strong fabric on the banks of the Ganges, a question is definitely roaming in this city that why did Narendra Modi choose Varanasi? And why did Kejriwal follow him here? The question is also that those who have come to shine the political star in Varanasi, will Kashi let the sun of his political fortune shine? If his search was something else, he would have come in search of peace, to calm his mind, he would have understood
 magar unki talash to varchasv kii talash he to unhen shanti kahaan se milegi? tabhi to kabir ne banaras ke bazaar main khadaa hokar kaha tha
 
 
 Where are you looking for Moko, i am not in the world, i am not a mosque, i am not in the Kailas Kaina or Kono Kriya, nor i am looking for yoga, but i am looking for a moment in a moment
 No, but Muslims also have a very strong relationship
 vah iske pani se vaju karata he
 Ganga brings life to her as well
 yahaan kii tahjeeb bismilla se shuru hokar bholenath ke charnon tak pahunchati he
 The weaves of Muslim weavers here adorn the idols of Hindu deities
 kaarobaari or saamaajik lihaaj se bhi hindu-muslmaan donon kaa taana-bana hi kabir kii jhini-jhini chadariyaa tak pahunchataa he, jo bhartiya samskruti kaa ek ahm rang he
 But will it also disintegrate all this social fabric when the election time comes and Kabir's mullah pandit's voice and bells will be separated? Will politics change the color of worship to win the war of rule? Will Shiva emanate from Ranjani's voice from the shehnai of Banaras Bismillah Khan? Will the politics of hatred dominate Banaras? With the belief that the banks of the Ganges always own a clean and cool mind like the waters of the Ganges, they will not let the fabric of the wet sheets fade away
 kabir kii in linon ko tab tak doharaate rahenge jab tak ki chunavi nattejey nahin aa jate

 'antaratma ne badalawaaya vot'taaja maamla upi kaa he, jahaan rajyasabha chunaav ke liye vot daale ja rahe hai
 BJP has made a dent in the votes of BSP and SP to win its 9th candidate
 guuruuvaar kii raat hui mukhyamantri yogi kii baithak main basapa vidhayak anil singh bhi pahunche
 On Friday morning, when Anil Singh reached the Tilak Hall of the UP Legislative Assembly for voting, he called for the BJP to vote for the conscience
 rajya main sattarudh bijepi ke liye upachunaav main haar ke baadaraajyasabha main jeet saakh kaa sawalban gai he
 So the saffron party put a lot of effort behind the curtain for this
 isi koshish main usne vipakshi partiyon ke vidhayakon ko apane ummidavaaron ke paksh main vot karwaane kaa khel antaratma ko samarpit kar diya
 Before voting in the Rajya Sabha elections, Anil Singh spoke of his' conscience 'and said,' i will vote on the conscience, i will vote for Maharajji (yogi Adityanath)
 ' basant ritu main karavat lene vaale anokhe 'anil' kii 'antaratma kii aawaaj' par pradesh ke upmukhyamantri keshav prasad maury ne kaha ki agar koi antaratma kii aawaaj par vot kare to uskaa swaagat he
 The biggest decision on the 'voice of conscience' in the politics of conscience was paramount for these leaders last year
 2017 kii july main bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne apane pad se istipha de diya tha
 After resigning, he called it a decision taken on the basis of 'conscience'
 us samay nitish, argedy or congress ke saath bihar main sarkaar chalaa rahe the, lekin parde ke peeche bijepi ke saath santhganth hone ke baad unhone yah gathbandhan tod diya or 24 ghante ke andar hi bijepi ke saath nai sarkaar bana lee
 He had said, 'I resigned at the sound of my conscience
 dekha ki koi rasta nahin he to namaskara kiya
 i felt that if i could not work, i separated myself from power
 maine tyaagptr de diya he
 What will happen next, when will it happen? sab bhavishya par chhod diya jaae
 Within a few hours, Nitish formed a new government with the BJP
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne twit kar bihar ko vikaas ke saath aane par shubhakamanaayen di
 In the name of this 'conscience', Bihar continued to be heavily politicized
 20 maheene tak saath main shashan karne ke baad argedy ke kai netaa isi aawaaj ke naam par sarkaar par sawaal daagate rahe
 The interim of other parties during the presidential elections in June last year, the 'voice of conscience' was raised when upa's presidential candidate Meira Kumar heard the 'voice of conscience' from the electoral college to cast his vote
 Had appealed unhone sabhi nirvaachak mandalon ko likhi chitthee main kaha tha ki nirvaachak mandal ke paas itihaas rachane kaa mauka he or wo saare matbhedon ko bhulaakar 'antaratma kii aawaaj' sunakar faisla len
 But his appeal did not benefit him much and NDA candidate Ramnath Kovind won the election
 sonia ne choda tha PM padahaalanki isi 'antaratma kii aawaaj' par 2004 main congress kii adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne pradhanmantri nahin banane kaa faisla liya
 He was politely refused to accept the post of Prime Minister citing the 'voice of conscience' when the UPA won a majority in the 2004 general election after the Congress' debacle in several states
 unhone kaha tha 'pradhanmantri kaa pad paanaa meraa dhyey nahin he
 i always thought that if ever i came in such a situation as today, i would listen to my 'conscience'
 main puri vinamrata se pad lene se inkaar kar rahi hum
 However, in the Rajya Sabha elections, many times legislators are allowed to vote on the 'voice of conscience', but before that people also assess their profit and loss

 In the case of allegedly raising anti-national slogans at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), the Delhi government on Friday said in the Patiala House Court that the police have filed a charge sheet in a confidential and hasty manner in the 2016 JNU sedition case
 kanhaiya kumaar samet anya ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati dene ke sambandh main faisla lene ke liye sarkaar ko ek maheene se zyada vakt lagegaa
 The Delhi government alleged in the court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Deepak Shehrawat that the police had filed the chargesheet in a hurried and clandestine manner without obtaining permission from the competent officer
 court ne pehle rajya sarkaar ko nirdesh diya tha ki vah mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati dene ke sambandh main spasht samay seemaa ke saath uchit jawaab daakhil kare
 The next hearing of the case is scheduled for April 8
 dilli sarkaar ne patiala house court main kaha, 'chargeshit par faisla standing council kii salaah milane ke ek maheene ke bheetar liya jayega
 The Delhi Government's Senior Standing Council has not been consulted on the matter yet, which is awaited
 'JNU sedition case: Delhi Govt replies in Patiala House Court, 'decision on chargesheet will be taken within one month after opinion is received from the standing counsel
 Opinion awaited from the senior standing counsel of the Delhi government
 ' Next date of hearing is April 8

 JNU sedition case: Delhi Govt replies in Patiala House Court, 'police has filed chargesheet in a secret and hasty manner without obtaining approval of the appropriate authority
 Department has not yet determined whether the alleged slogans raised were seditious or not
 '- ANI (@ANI) April 5, 2019 The Delhi Police filed a charge sheet in the month of January after 3 years in this case of alleged slogans
 dilli sarkaar ne is maamle par apana paksh philhal rakhaa hi nahin he
 Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid, Anirban and seven Kashmiri students have been accused in the chargesheet filed by the Delhi Police in Patiala House Court
 police ne chargeshit main kaha he ki yaa to in logon ne jeenyu main deshadrohi naare lagaae yaa jin logon ne naare lagaae, ye unka sahyog kar rahe the
 The police had also given a list of 56 such students against whom there are no direct charges against them, but the police suspect that they were indirectly involved in raising anti-national slogans
 haalanki sunwaayee main deree par dilli police kaa aarope he ki dilli sarkaar lagaataar maamle ko or lanbaa khinchne ke liye samay le rahi he
 Now a decision on this matter can come only if the Senior Standing Council of Delhi Government also presents itself
 (pitiai or eenai input ke saath) It is a wonderful story of looking at women and men from their own perspective, in which there is no top and no bottom, but part of the creation process of creation, which is necessary for its operation
 vishnu prabhakar ne apni mahaan kriti 'ardhnarishwar' main vyaktiman, samajaman evam antarman ke vividh staron par nari or nar ke maansikta kii aisi vyavastha di he, jo tamaam saamaajik vyavastha se alag he
 The novel 'ardhanarishwar' is an attempt to achieve the melody and harmony of male and female
 vahi jati-paati or dharm kii samasya, vahi vivaah, talaak, balaatkaar kii samasya, vahi nari-shoshan, utpeedan, vahi tuutate-bikharate jivan kii kahani, kintu mukti ke liye ‘koi to’ kii pratiksha nahin he
 Here the author has created a larger framework as a solution
 jaisaa ki hamaare puranic aakhyaan main bhi he, ‘ardhnarishwar’ kaa abhipret nari or nar kii samaan sahabhaagita ko praapt karnaa he
 For this, it is necessary to accept each other with their weaknesses and strengths and to accept that the union of nature and man is also necessary for creation
 mul samasya to purush kii he, uske paurushik aham kii, jo use ‘bechaara’ bana detii he
 We have to make it simple
 isi kii asahajata se stri bahut-se bandhan todakar aage nikal ai he
 But it is not the intention of the author to create a disorderly form without bonding, but to create a life-raga by ending the tightness of the bonds and giving each note its proper place
 ajit ke shabdon main lekhak kahata he: ‘‘main sumita ko apni daastaa se mukt kar doongaa
 I'll be free from his slavery
 tabhi ham sachmuch pati-patni ho sakenge
 
 
 
 ’’ isi swayan kii daastaa se mukti kaa naam he, ‘ardhnarishwar’
 For the readers of Sahitya Aaj Tak, this excerpt of the wonderful art of the human mind, Vishnu Prabhakar's novel Ardhanariswar, courtesy of the publisher 'kitabghar': Excerpts from 'ardhanarishwar' section, i stood for many moments before putting my hand on Manusumitaghanti
 kitne bojhil the ve thithure kshan ki main paseene-paseene ho ai
 
 
 
 to kya laut jaaon yaheen se or phone par koi bahaanaa bana don ? jaanati hoon vah sab vyarth hoga kyonki tab antar main ghumdta dhuaan or kaduva ho uthegaa
 Whoever rotates so intensely in the intermittent can breathe breath because the rites have not left the path of exit
 
 
 
 No, i will not return
 apane ko pidaa dete-dete itnaa thak gai hoon ki mukti chaahati hoon or mukti apane ko anaavruth karne main hi he
 How long will anyone run away from the punishment of deeds done? If words remain inside, they are shattered, when they are liberated, they become literature
 jo nahin dekha usase ham aakraant kyon rahete hai ? jo bhoga he use chhipate kyon hai ?
 
 
 Don't know how many times i have struggled and broken, how many times i have argued with myself about the definition of sin and virtue, how many times, but one thing i have never been able to do - do not expose myself Pie
 
 
 aaj main vahi karne kaa drudh nishchay karke yahan ai hoon
 i want to open my self
 utaar phenkna chaahati hoon, sanskaron ke dhuen kii chadar ko
 But why does the tumultuous flow in the end make me giggle every moment? Why are daily letters filled with embarrassing incidents of rape every day, why intellectuals debate every moment about this word? The same word keeps echoing in the country's Parliament again and again, but why doesn't something happen somewhere? Words, words and words
 kriya ke bina shabd kaa astitv sarthak hua he kya ?shaayad aisa to nahin ki ye sharmnaak ghatnaayen padhakar hamen dard ke sthaan par ek romaanchak anubhuti hoti he, ‘kaash ham na hue kii mudra main
 
 
 Therefore, even in the absence of evidence, most of the accused are cleared
 
 
 
 And wasn't she the woman who said, "I have been raped many times
" isamen bura kya he, mazaa hi aata he
 
 
 
 ’’lekin apana naam bataane kaa saahas usamen bhi nahin tha
 That's the problem
 isi se to mukti chaahati hoon main
 And then suddenly this desire for liberation compelled me to press the bell vigorously
 ghantii par aghat hua nahin ki udhar vaataavaran ‘king-king’ ke anwarat uthte shabd se goonj uthaa
 Two moments later, after opening the door, a gentle darshan matured
 mukh par swaagat ke liye khinchi smiti kii rekhaayen
 Perceptive faith in the eyes, the line of the beautiful vermilion in demand, white-blown embellishments, long hairstyle, broad-pink light saree, spoken softly and sweetly, "are you Sumita ji, are you not? i was just waiting for you
 ghar main is samay koi nahin he, keval aap or main
 
 
 "and Smriti got deeper
" main samaj gai vyangy ko, par muskaraai nahin
 Something tightened somewhere, unknowingly
 kya kah gai yah
 Still, in order to keep myself as strong as possible, i said softly, "in which words should i thank you that you have accepted to meet me!" "you are associated with a magazine perhaps?" Not that i work in Delhi School of Social Work but i am fond of writing
 kahaniyaan likhti hoon
 Sometimes i write an article about the problem of women
 ‘nari-man’ ke liye aajkal
 
 
 "" i know that nowadays only two words echo in the atmosphere, rape and bride-burning
 
 
 baitho
 "until now we were both walking
" ab saamne drawing room tha, main sofe par baith gai
 Elegant, but symbol of simplicity
 ek shailf main pustaken, duusare main do-teen kala-kritiyaan
 a very soulful picture of the Shivalinga peak of the Himalayas on the wall throughout the room
 jitna angadh, utana garimamay
 a single bed at one side and a sofa on the other side
 bich main kaanch se aavruth ek golakaar mej
 On top of it and down there are new magazines
 ‘‘padhane kaa shauk he aapako ?’’ anayas hi munh se nikal gayi ye shabd
 "yes, we only study all four
" ’’‘‘chaaron ?’’ saprashn maine dekha
 "we two, our two," she laughed suddenly
 main bhi khul gai
 Woke up all over the room
 choti-choti baaten kabhi kitna utfull kar jaati hai
 He told, "the daughter is married in Canada and the son teaches at the college
 abhi shaadi kii he, bahu reserve bank main he
 Both are on honeymoon
 ’’main baat kaa chor apane haath main le paati ki ve phir bol uthin, ‘‘chaay abhi lenaa pasand karengi yaa baad main ?’’‘‘baad main,’’ main kahana to nahin chaahati thi par na jane kyon kah gai
 Sometimes we are so ignorant of ourselves that it seems that instead of our own 'I' within us, someone else's 'I' is sitting
 unhen meri baat acchhee lagi
 Closed the door and sat down with me, said, "yes, it will be good to drink later
 ab main aapke saamne hoon, lekin ek baat kah don saaf-saaf
 Only when i can believe that i will not reveal my name or my husband's name anywhere
 nari ho tum bhi
 
 
 
 ’’ek baar to main hill uthi, baar-baar saat paradon ko bhed kar vahi baat saamne kyon ujagar ho jaati he ? kyon anaavruth nahin kar pate ham apane ko kyon
 
 
 Why 
 
 kyon
 
 
 ? ”as the earthquake has come, but in the second moment i somehow saved myself
 boli, ‘‘vishwaas kar sakati hai to sach maniye ki kisi patr-patrika main aapke liye is saakshaatkaar ko prakashit nahin karuungi
 "then?" He was turning his question on clairvoyant vision towards me
 ‘‘sab kuch bataauungi, par pehle aapse sun lun
 
 
 My daughter is as old as you are, but she was so courageous that your wounds came to scrape
 kyon kiya maine yah dussahas, iske peeche maatr ek shodhakarta kii jigyaasa hi nahin he
 Something is so deep, something so personal that i have connected with you in a deep affinity
 
 
 ’’praudha kii mere rome-rome ko cheer jane vaali bhedak drushti abhi bhi meri aankhon main jhaank rahi thi
 
 
 But now there was a recognized pain floating there
 dard kaa dard se ek avyaakhyayit rishta hota he
 He recognised that pain
 unke netra bhig aae
 Do not know in which vacuum many moments were lost
 phir vahiin se bolne lageen
 They were not words, there was a sound that was rife in words and spread throughout its entirety, 'a memory that rips and every ripped moment becomes so sharp that the existence is bled
 pataa nahin ve kya bol rahi thim; pataa nahin main kya sun rahi thi
 Remember this much, he said, "we were newly married
" swapnon main bahurangi sansar main ji rahe the ham
 They and I, i and they
 us mahanagar main karyaalay tha unka
 There was a servant at home, their old servant
 ji-jaan se kaam karata
 i kept moving back and forth
 ek din ve hanskar bole, ‘tumhen apana banane ko kisi chatukaari karata he dusht ! jaanata he ab to tum hi swamini ho meri bhi, uski bhi
 "dhat," i laughed with love
 swapn main bhi nahin soch sakati thi ki vish madhur bhi ho saktaa he
 '' And thus the days were passing
 us din ve sadaa kii tarah mujhe pyaar se thapthapa kar daftar gayi
 i entered the bathroom easily
 der tak khelti rahi pani se or apane tan se
 The wines of love make everything intoxicating
 bahut der baad gunagunaati hui baahar shaynagar main ai ki apad-mastak kaanp uthi
 Our servant was standing in front of me in my dormitory and a knife in his hand
 maine ekadam sari lapetate hue usase kaha, ‘tum yahan kya kar rahe ho ? rasoi main jaao or
 
 
 
 ’‘‘main apana vaakya puraa kar paati ki usne mujhe jor se dhakka diya
 In the process of folding the sari then my two hands were surrounded, the contingency of the incident on it, i fell quickly on the floor
 meraa sar palang kii pattee se takaraayaa
 The second moment he was on my chest with a knife in his hand
 uskaa vah raudra rup, aankhon se tapakati vahshat, meri aankhon main dhuaan bhar gaya, jamaa hua kadava dhuaan
 
 
 My screams froze in the same smoke
 
 
 
 "drops fell on his head
" ankhen na jane kahan dekh rahi thim, jaise vahaan koi nahin tha, bas pashavik prakriya kii bhayaavah goonj thi jise ham donon samaan rup se ji rahe the
 What torture was it to live like that ! After several moments she spoke again
 tab kaisaa dard tha unki vaani main, ‘‘itnaa hi yaad he ki haath main gaharaa jakhm khaakar bhi main apane ko na bachaa pai
 i still don't know exactly how that happened? i lost consciousness just after falling
 jo kuch sangharsh maine kiya hoga, hatprabhta main hi kiya hoga
 
 
 
 ’’ve phir maun ho gayi
 It was like smoke filled his nasal cavities
 main adaalat main bahes karne vaali vakil to thi nahin ki pareshaan karne vaale prashn puuchhati, ‘aapane jaanboojh kar sangharsh nahin kiya to aapaki kahin-na-kahin kisi-na-kisi str par sahmati rahi hogi
 'I was just a woman and had gone through that process more or less
 kai kshan baad itnaa hi poocha, ‘‘aapaki cheekh sunakar pados main halchal nahin hui ?’’‘‘bade nagaron main pados kii itani chintaa kise hoti he ? or ham jo naye-naye the
 Even then a sister heard my scream, but by the time she could decide to do something, she had done her work
 unke pati ke aane se itnaa hi hua ki mere praan batch gaye
 What was the meaning of their being saved or not able to escape? "" Will you say so even now? "" i then got distracted and spoke
 unhone tadap kar meri ore dekha
 Wanted to say something with intensity, but became silent with equal intensity
 dekh rahi thi ki kitna parishram karnaa padaa tha unhen us ayaachit maun ke liye
 i got him hurt to his heart
 vahi prashn to mujhe kured rahaa tha
 The same question had drawn me to them, yet i said softly, "forgive me
" aapako pidaa pahunchaai maine
 "she had saved herself
" chehre par pehle kii-si saumyata laut ai
 She said slowly, "no daughter, you did not hurt me
" pidaa to ham apane ko swayan dete hai, swayan se yahi prashn puch-puch kar
 Why are we asking this question ? Why do we worry that someone is not looking at us with the eyes of Hikrat? i say about me
 bahan ke pati ne turant mere pati ko phone kiya
 Until they arrived i was unconscious
 main aatm-glani se sisak rahi thi
 When i saw him i broke down my patience
 pataa nahin, bharosa paane kii aashaa main yaa khone ke dar se
 They did not speak a word
 bahut der tak apane se sata kar sahalaate rahe
 i daringly looked into his eyes with a karun-katar vision
 tatol kar unka haath pakadaa ki honton tak le aaun ki phir band tut gaya
 i start sobbing again
 ve mere upar jhuk aae, apane oth mere jalte othon par rakh die, yah kehete hue, ‘pammi ! tum jaraa bhi pareshaan mat hoo
 You are not guilty
 main us darinde ko
 
 
 "" This time i was literally unconscious in his arms
 bharose kaa aashwaasan bhi kam pidaa nahin detaa, bitiyaa ! us bharose ke kaaran hi main vah hoon jo tum dekh rahi ho
 Otherwise what would have happened
 
 
 ’’‘‘main jaanati hoon ki kya hota
 You are lucky otherwise
 
 
 ’’‘ve boleen, ‘main to unka saahas dekhakar hatprabh hoti ja rahi thi
 i think today, they should have done what they did
 police ai
 He arrested that lady
 
 
 ’’maine sahasaa tok diya unhen, ‘‘tab to aapako adaalat main janaa padaa hoga or
 
 
 "" No, "he said," i didn't have to bear all that
 police ne baari rishwat lekar use chhod diya
 Thanedar said to my husband, there is no eyewitness
 vah doshi he yah pramanit karne ke liye aapaki patni ko jis yatnaa main se gujaarna hoga usko sah paayengi vah
 
 
 ? "" Then the matter ended here
 yahi ho saktaa tha
 "" i think, if it had not happened, would i have been able to bear the arguments of the lawyer? My husband imagined my torture and became silent
 mujhe yaad he ve bahut tadpe the lekin jaisaa hamaara samaaj he, hamaare sanskaar hai, usamen or ho bhi kya saktaa tha ? unhone kai din baad kaha tha, kisi he hamaari naitikta ! insaaniyat ke prati itnaa bada jaghanya aparaadh keval isi chhadam naitikta ke kaaran dandit hue bina rah gaya
 Who will break this suicide cycle of morality
 
 
 
 ? "" Has your husband been discussing this topic even later? "" No, never! He had assured me the same night, 'pampi! You are innocent, holy
 tum mere liye vahi ho jo savere thim or sadaa vahi rahogi
 'I know, they are the exception in today's male-dominated society
 par unhone aaj tak apane us aashwaasan ko kabhi na nahin jhuthlaayaa
 "" And you? "" Hearing the question, she kept looking at me
 jaise usee se bachanaa chaah rahi hon, par, jaise pairon ke neeche se ret khisak jaati he vaise hi bachane kaa kshan khisak gaya
 She said in my eyes, "really Sumita!" Despite everything, i was not what i was when i left the bathroom
 samaaj kii niti-naitikta, shaastra main paap-punya kii vyakhya, nar-nari ke sambandh sabane milakar mere antajkaran main yah bhaavana pabast kar di thi ki kuch aghatit ghat gaya he or jo kuch ghatit hua he vah paap he
 This is a kind of sin that can not be retaliated
 mujhe aparaadhini us darinde ne nahin banaaya balki mere samaaj ne banaaya
 What i could not accept from within, was imposed on me
 jiske prati aparaadh kiya gaya, sajaa bhi usee ko mili
 Hurt, humiliated i am no longer the culprit of anyone's compassion
 
 
 ’’ve rukeen jaise kahin dard kasak uthaa tha or vah kasak chehre ko vivarna kar gai thi
 Said in a hurt tone, "what a big world is my heart stained with pain!" Can't show anyone, can't even sympathize with anyone
 isiilie pati-parivaar kaa mukt sneh-satkar paakar bhi mujhe aaj bhi lagata he ki jaise har koi mujhe hikaarat kii nigaah se dekh rahaa he
 i tremble with that self-respect, not because someone thinks me guilty, but because i am not able to free myself from this guilt, why does it not shock the society? " She was speaking loosely
 mujhe lag rahaa tha ki jaise ve hai hi nahin
 This is me, i am asking myself why i am not giving away my society to myself? i don't know when he started speaking again, when i started listening
 ve kah rahi thim, ‘‘man kii paraten jab khulne hi lagi hai to kuch na chhipaaungi
 Could not hide even from them
 chaha bhi nahin tha
 For so many days he did not ask me for anything
 mujhe aashwast hi karte rahe
 My own heart was overflowing with immense hatred towards men
 ankhen band hotin to unako bhi apane se pare hataane ko vyakul ho uthati
 Screaming would happen that my eyes would open and i would shudder
 ve poochhate, ‘kya hua, pammi ?’‘‘main sagyaanhin-si cheekh uthati, ‘tum purush ho
 i hate men
 ’‘‘ve mujhe apane se or bhi sata lete or main hosh main aakar unki chaati main munh chipa kar subak uthati, ‘mujhe maaf kar do
 Clean me up ’ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 "pumpy!" One day he said to me, 'how long will you hate yourself? How long will you torture yourself? "" What should i do, tell me what should i do? "" Think of me, you will understand everything
 ’‘‘kya kah diya unhone ? mere antar kaa akaash deept ho uthaa nimish maatr main
 Those too were men
 ghrinaa kar sakate the mujhase
 
 
 "but they were saying something else," the matter is ultimately with you, your own strength and your own ability
 tum girogi, samaaj tumhen rondtha chalaa jayega
 You would like to stand, i will be with you
 tumme chalane kaa sankalp hoga to meri shakti tumhen ajey kar degi
 "" i tell you the truth, i was up in that moment and i madly grinded them in my embrace
 jaise kuch hua hi nahin tha
 Just two of us were crazy, crazy to join, the soul was once one, then divided into two, now be confused about being one again
 us bhavakul sthiti main na jane kya-kya kah gai unase
 i have only left so much that i said, 'I was afraid so far
 jaise anginat hinsr pashu ghere hue hon mujhe, meri boti-boti noch lene ke liye, par ab, ab main purna shant hoon, nishcint hoon
 i can put my eyes in the eyes of those violent animals and say, now i am not afraid of you
 main puri tarah surakshit hoon
 i have protection that will never leave me
 ' ’’us kshan unka yatnaa se trast mukhdaa ek ujaas se ujala-ujala ho aayaa tha, par tabhi apane ko chakit karte hue maine puch liya, ‘‘aapane yah sangrakshan unheen se kyon paanaa chaha, apane andar se kyon nahin khoja ?’’sunakar ve stabdh-si meri ore dekhne lageen
 The energy that was lost a moment ago vanished
 dard sahane kii yatnaa se vikrut hota cheharaa phir ubhar aayaa mere saamne
 Many moments kept covering themselves
 yug biit gayi un traasad kshanon main
 When she was healthy, she said, "I have asked this same question millions of times myself
 par bitiyaa, main jis peedi kii hoon usamen stri kaa swatantra astitv tha hi kahan ? haan, kabhi-kabhi kalpana mastishk main kaundh uthati thi or yah sochakar santosh kar lete the ham log ki na sahi ham, hamaare baad kii yaa uske baad kii peedi kii nari us sangrakshan ko paane ke liye baahar nahin bhatakegi
 Spouses are complementary and supportive of each other
 ek-duusare par ashrith nahin
 This time it was my turn to be shocked
 aashcharya, is seemaa tak soch sakati thi yah peedi ! phir jaise kisi ne chetaya ho- na soch sakati to tum itnaa aakul-vyakul hokar kyon sandhan karne nikal padatin ?main na jane kahan pahunch gai thi
 When she returned suddenly, she was saying, "it was my endeavor by getting his support that that memory is erased from my psyche, but how can anyone escape from an earthquake?" Initially i used to feel suspicious about his love, but as he suggested, i started fighting on my own, got hurt, stumbled, but in my attempt to break away from the group and become a person He got full support, he would say, "only the person will have the strength and courage, then only the society will be able to get power," i knew that i was going to be a mother, so i became convinced that my husband's love is love, not compassion, when the son came in his lap, my gap in family busy was filled with the feeling of a new inexpressible happiness
 ek varsh baad beti bhi aa gai
 did not get any time to think then
 kabhi-kabhi ve vyangy karte, ‘ab tum maan ho, meri patni nahin
 Why would you worry about me 
 
 ?’‘‘dhat,’ main beti ko unki god main daalkar unke kandhe dabaa detii, par na jane kab or sukh ke saat parde cheer kar vah vikaraal kshan mere mastishk main kaundh-kaundh uthta or main
 
 
 She suddenly became silent
 ve meri ore nahin dekh rahi thim
 i found, their head is stuck on the couch and they have reached far, where no one cares about the existence of anyone
 main bhi to us kshan mahashunya main pahunch gai thi kyonki mere bheetar bhi vahiin tumulanaad chhidaa tha, par main uskaa abhas unako nahin hone dena chaah rahi thi
 So i let them fight with themselves and closed their eyes
 koi teesraa dekhtaa to paata ki jaise dard ke prashanth mahaasaagar main dubi do peedit atmaaen apane pankh fadafdana bhul kar sthir ho gai hon
 
 
 But the contingency with which she had fallen silent, she stunned me by the same contingency, "I tell you one thing
" 
 
 ’’ve phir chup ho gayi
 i asked, "you were saying something
 ’’‘‘haan, achaanak ek din kya hua ! meri bacchee tab sattarah varsh kii ho chuki thi tab kii baat he yah
 He asked me, "mother, have you ever had to endure anything in your life that no woman wants to bear?" Possessed
 maine apane pati kii ore dekha
 Got sight usee kshan hamane nirnay kar liya ki kuch nahin chhipaana he
 My son was also there
 mere pati ne dhire-dhire bade sanyat swar main sab kuch bataa diya
 Both children did not take sight until they heard the full story
 mere pati maun ho gaye tab bhi ekaek unhone koi pratikriya nahin vyakt kii
 Took several moments to reconstitue herself
 ve stabdh-tehre kuch kshan, mere liye jaise yugon kii pidaa ko saakaar kar gaye
 How do those moments become alive, which have become past! Life never returns in the same way, but the time stands the same way
 samay marataa nahin, bas bitta he
 
 
 "I did not know where i had reached that i felt the healthy arms on my daughter's tender arms bound me in a hug as if she wanted to join me
" usne apana cheharaa mere chehre se sata diya
 Speak in love with mother's voice, 'mother! You are innocent here
 tum kabhi apane ko doshi mat maananaa
 "my son came in a bit of a charge," he said, "everything has to change; The mindset of the whole society has to be changed
 ’‘‘pati-santaan se ghiri mujhe us din apane nari hone par garv hua
 pulak-pulak woke up that moment
 pati kii ore dekhakar maine ankhen ponch leen
 Those who belonged to me do not look at Hikrat, what greater happiness can there be than that assurance! After that no one discussed the incident again
 aaj tak nahin kii
 "" But, that event within you is still alive today
 bhuulane main vishwaas nahin he shaayad ?’’‘‘vah vishwaas hamaare karne yaa na karne kaa mohataaj nahin he
 "" Yes, why would you have bothered with yourself? "" i knew that i had become irresistibly cruel, but maybe that was inevitable
 isliye ek kshan kahin dur dekha unhone, phir boleen, ‘‘jaanati hoon beti ! tum kya kahana chaahati ho
 He is also fine
 
 
 samaaj kii waisi maansikta kyon bani, sanskaar he kya ? kya ye hi sanskaar hamen hamaari drushti main doshi nahin bana dete ? lekin jaisaa maine kaha tha, meraa betaa yaa kahoon mere baad kii peedi inhen sanskaron se mukti kii baat nahin kahati kya ?’’‘‘par kya mukti mil saki ? main hoon us peedi kii
 "she wanted to say that if the desire has arisen, why not get liberation, but i was shocked to hear my second point
" boli, ‘‘tum
 
 
 What do you want to say? "" That's the same thing happened to me
 kuch isse alag
 Something that you would not even want to believe
 ’’achaanak vaataavaran main phir se sheet lahar daud gai ho
 Like the boat sinking in the turbulent waves of the sea, after getting the impression of the shore, then wanders into the torch
 unki bhayanak ankhen meri aankhon se milin maano puuchhati hon, tum
 
 
 you
 
 
 bhi kya
 
 
 ?I immediately turn my eyes from there
 mere bheetar jamaa dene vaali thandak mujhe aahat kar rahi thi or mere akaash main badi tezi se ulkapaat ho rahaa tha
 i had to try hard to save myself
 samay lene ke liye maine ek vyarth kaa prashn puch liya, ‘‘kya tum soch sakati ho ki main ab unase chhipakar kuch karuungi ? ve sab kuch jaanate hai
 "I couldn't say anything suddenly
 unhone ek kshan rukkar poocha, ‘‘tum apni baat kah rahi thim na ?’’maine dhire-dhire kaha, kahin dur dekhte hue, ‘‘haan, apni baat kahoongi main
 That's why this contextual statement was created
 ajna dengi to kal aauungi
 "he looked at the clock," "yes, it's four o'clock
" pataa hi nahin chalaa
 i bring tea pikar janaa or kal avashya aana

 Chandrashekhar (now Cabinet Secretary) had taken action on a November 9, 2005 file noting
 isamen aagrah kiya gaya tha ki kendriya aarthik guptchar beuro (seeiibi) ke sthaan par phone tap karne kaa kaam sibiditi ko saunp diya jaae
 Do Chidambaram and Chandrashekhar want cbdt's right to watch and listen to telephone conversations intermittently under pressure from "vested corporate interests"? The CBDT and the miserable IAS lobby, which is feeling the worst, Such is the claim
 chandrashekhar ke note-(epah286 / 117 / 2005ity (ienvi2)-main saaf kaha gaya tha ki ''kar chori rokane or kar chori karne waalon kii pahchaan karne; kaale dhan par ankush lagane or rashtriya saz nunatam kaarykram nitiyon ko lagu karne ke liye sibiditi ko shaamil karnaa jaruri he kyonki kaale dhan kaa aatankwaad or anya mafia gatividhiyon se nikat sambandh he, uskaa kaam khufia jaankaree ikattha karnaa or use jaanch agenciyon ke saath baantnaa bhi he
 As suggested by the Ministry of Home Affairs, i recommend, by amending our earlier proposal, we can add the investigation branch of the Income Tax Department to the list of agencies that can monitor telephone conversations, in lieu of the Central Bureau of Economic Intelligence

 jaruri he ki kaale dhan ko paidaa hone se pehle hi khatm kiya jaae or use safed banane ke dhandhe se nibatane ke liye kendriya aarthik guptchar beuro ke sthaan par yah kaam sibiditi ko saunpa jaae
 What can one guess from the changes in the role of Chidambaram and Chandrasekhar? In his early incarnations, he was the biggest advocate for the right of phone tapping to be given to CBDT
 sambhawatah sachaaiye he ki cabinet sachiv kii haisiyat se chandrashekhar jis pad par baithe hai vah khud sibiditi kii jaanch ke ghere main he

 Recently, several incidents of corruption of administrative officers have come to light
 sibiditi, anek maamalon main aparaadhiyon ko pakadaney ke liye telephone par baatcheet ko bich main sunne main sabase aage rahi he
 The Cabinet Secretary has nothing to do with this, while the Home Minister is involved in a confrontation with the Finance Minister
 sarkaar adhikrut phone tanping ke niyamon ko or kadaa bananaa chaahati he
 CBDT sources told India Today that the home ministry is bowing to pressure from corporate interests
 chandrashekhar ke netritv main ek samiti ne sifarish kii he ki sibiditi ko phone tap karne vaali agenciyon kii suchi se hataa diya jaae
 But the concerned Prime Minister's Office has asked Chidambaram to consult Mukherjee before taking a final decision on the matter

 Counting continues in both states
 donon hi rajyon main bijepi ko spasht bahumat miltaa dikh rahaa he
 bjp's victory in Gujarat has been decided and in Himachal Pradesh the lotus bloom has been decided
 matganana se jude ab tak ke aankadon se saaf he ki is gujarat chunaav ke nateezon main nirdaleey or NOTA (inamen se koi nahin) ne khel kar diya
 According to the Election Commission, in Gujarat, up to now, independents 4 in the figures
 1 fisadi (988415) vot mili, to vahiin NOTA par 1
 8% (519962) votes were cast, which is more than the votes received by BSP and NCP

 4 fisadi vot mili hai
 In the last 4 and a half years, BJP has wrested power from Congress in many states including the Center
 congress ke haathon se himachal kii satta ko chhinakar bijepi ne 'congress mukt bharat' ke naare main ek kadam or aage badhaayaa he
 The strange situation is that the person who was responsible for the news in the government, did not himself know about his leave
 pradhanmantri ke media salaahkaar pad se harish khare ko hataane kaa faisla chah maheene pehle kiya ja chukaa tha
 The Congress leadership was unhappy with their failure to bring the government's views to the public
 lekin 19 janvari ko jab pankaj pachori ko sanchaar salaahkaar yani communication adwiser niyukt kiya gaya, tab bhi khare ko baat samaj main nahin ai
 He may have thought that since his status is of secretary level and Pachauri has been placed at the level of additional secretary, Pachauri will work under him
 khare ne antat istipha tab diya, jab unase yah kah diya gaya ki pachori sidhe principal secretary pulak chatarji ko report karenge
 There was no place for Khare in the new command series
 ek cabinet mantri ke anusaar, khare ne sonia gandhi ke rajnatik sachiv ahamed patel se madad kii guhaar kii thi
 Although it is not clear what Patel told him, he did get a message from 10 Janpath
 unase kaha gaya ki agar ve chupchaap chale jate hai, to unhen iske evaj main kuch mil saktaa he

 When Dua was ousted from the Prime Minister's Office in 2001, two years after assuming office, he was made India's ambassador to Denmark two years later
 media ke prati khare kii nafrat jag jaahir he
 The manner in which he rebuffed Arnab Goswami, the editor-in-chief of Times Now television channel, was broadcast live on media across the country
 16 farvari, 2011 ko khare ne pradhanmantri or tivi sampadakon kii ek mulaakaat rakhi thi
 When Goswami asked one question after another, Khare silenced him by saying, "there is no cross-examination of the Prime Minister here
" '' iske pehle tak saare sawaalon kaa sidhe saamana karte najar aa rahe pradhanmantri manmohan singh achaanak aise najar aane lage, jaise ve kuch chhipaana chaah rahe hon
 The journalists of the print media were even more proud
 pradhanmantri kii aalochana kii to kabhi-kabhaar andekhi ho jaati thi, lekin pradhanmantri ke media salaahkaar kii aalochana kii sajaa ke taur par patrkaar piemo se bedakhal hi kar die jate the
 It is important that Pachauri will report to Chatterjee and not to the Prime Minister as has been the case
 chatarji sonia or rahul gandhi se apni najdiki ke liye jane jate hai or pradhanmantri karyaalay main unki maujuudagi ko south block par 10 janpath kii badhati pakad ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 In the first term of the UPA, when Manmohan chose his friend's son Sanjay Baru as his media advisor, he was given only one assignment
 baru bataate hai ki ''maine pradhanmantri se poocha tha ki mujhse unki kya ummiden hai, to unhone kaha tha ki main chahta hum tum mere aankh or kaan bano
 Without fear or partiality, tell me what you think i need to know
 '' ab yahi kaam pachori karenge, lekin pradhanmantri ke liye nahin, chatarji ke liye
 Pachauri, who is a television editor, is expected to understand the moment-to-moment needs of electronic media much better than Khare
 baru kehete hai, ''media salaahkaar kii bhoomika samay-samay par badalati rahati he
 H
 vaai
 Sharda Prasad (media Advisor to Indira Gandhi) once told me that she was dealing with five editors while i was dealing with 300 TV channels and newspapers
 '' mul makasad he ki pradhanmantri charchaa main rahen
 In Khare's Nizam, the Prime Minister's Office became a victim of silence, leaving a message that Manmohan did nothing
 pachori ne jo sabase pehla kaam kiya he vah pradhanmantri karyaalay ko twitor par laane kaa he
 Law Minister Salman Khurshid acknowledges that the government has not used social media effectively
 pachori kaa pehla twit tha rashtriya dakshata vikaas parishad kii pradhanmantri karyaalay ke adhikariyon ke saath mulaakaat kaa
 In another tweet Pachauri writes, "looking forward to meeting some of the bravest children in the country
" ganatantr diwas kii parade main unhen hameshaa haathiyon par baithe dekha karata tha
 Pachauri is not as senior as his predecessors
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ke press salaahkaar rahe purv patrkaar ashok tandon ke mutabik, ''isse press information beuro (piibi) kaa mahatv bad saktaa he
 "in such a case, Pachauri will have to work in tandem with Information Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni
" khare to hansmukh mizaaj soni ko bhi naaraaz kar baithe the
 He first invited Sony to join a press conference with television editors and then withdrew
 congress ke ek mahasachiv ke anusaar, soochna evam prasaaran mantri se kaha gaya ki kamare main ''itani jagah nahin he'' ki unhen bhi sthaan diya ja sake
 Politically astute Soni carved her own place
 kuch maheene baad, may, 2011 main pradhanmantri ko unhone is baat ke liye raji kar liya ki media ko sanbhaalane ke liye mantriyon kaa ek samooh banaaya jaae
 Promoting the Prime Minister in the media is an important part of the press advisor's work
 tandon bataate hai , ''pradhanmantri se milane kaa mauka mil paanaa sabase ahm hota he
 We encouraged editors to accompany us on foreign trips
 vimaan main har ek ko pradhanmantri ke saath aadhe ghante tak baatcheet kaa mauka miltaa tha
 In this, they could talk whatever they want
 ''ve yah bataate hue muskaraa dete hai ki ''kuch maamalon main to sampadak log rajyasabha kii seat ke liye apni pairvi bhi kar daalate the
 "tandon was luckier than some in the sense that Vajpayee was the media's favorite

 He laughs faintly, remembering that when the then Prime Minister went on a 15-day meeting to Harare and took 15 of his relatives together, the press called the batch "gowda's G-15 '' said
 dua poochhate hai, ''jo vyakti camaron ke saamne vigyaan bhawan main kharrate bharta ho, uski chhavi aap kaise nikhaarenge?''manmohan ke salaahkaaron ko satta ke do kendron-10 janpath or 7 rescorse road-ke bich santulan baithaana hota he
 The rumor is that the recent motive of Khare's laptop theft was to hack his mail and get to know his views about the Congress leaders
 agar sachmuch aisa tha, to chor ko itani jahamat uthaane kii koi jarurat nahin thi
 Khare never concealed his dislike for Sonia
 6 sitambar, 2000 ko da hindu main khare ne is baat kaa majaak banaaya tha ki ''sonia gandhi ke nani banane par badhai dene 10 janpath pahunche prashasti gane vaale jatthe kaa netritv manmohan singh ne kiya
 In September 2010, at a book release event, Khare said, "congress is a status quoist party
 yah kisi siddhant main vishwaas nahin karti he
 "looking at Harish Khare's track record, a simple tweet by Pachauri would be a miracle in terms of reaching the media

 ) Recalling the old days of getting Infosys out of bad times, Chairman NR Narayana Murthy said that it will take at least three years to bring Infosys to the desired heights again and some tough decisions will have to be taken which can be painful
 
 sevanivruti ke baad ek baar phir infosis kii kaman sanbhaalane vaale murti ne company kii 32veen salanaa aam baithak main shairdharakon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ‘chunauti kadi he or kaam mushkil
 Infosys, a leader in the information technology sector, has been giving disappointing results for some time, raising investor concerns
 company ko phir se oonchai par pahunchane ke liye do saptaah pehle hi narayanamurthi ko kaaryakari chairman niyukt kiya gaya
 The comments shairdharakon ko sambodhit karte hue murti ne kaha ‘kushal gunvattta or puri lagan ke saath kaam karne vaali team hone ke baavjood jaisaa ham chaahate hai us tarah kaa infosis banane main kam se kam 36 maheene kaa samay lagegaa

 Murthy, who once again took charge of Infosys after retirement, while addressing shareholders at the company's 32nd annual general meeting, said, "the challenge is tough and work is difficult
" ’ soochna praudyogiki kshetra kii agrani company infosis pichley kuch samay se niraashajanak parinaam de rahi he jisase niveshkon main chintaa bad gai he
 Two weeks ago, Narayan Murthy was appointed as executive chairman to revive the company
 tippaniyan Addressing the shareholders, Murthy said, "despite having a team that works with efficient quality and dedication, it will take at least 36 months to create the kind of Infosys that we want
 is prakriya main kuch kade faisle lene honge jo ki baad main peedaadaayak ho sakate hai
 Murthy called upon the shareholders for their support during this crucial journey of the company over the next three years

 'mohabbat' kaa naam to sabane suna hoga lekin iske asli myne kuch hi log jaanate hai
 It is said that if you are in love then it should be with respect and it should be so that the whole life should be spent for someone's love
 kya ho agar aapako pataa chale ki kisi ne apane pyaar kaa khyaal rakhane ke liye apni jindagi ke 56 saal qurbaan kar die hai
 Yes, this is true and this example has been set by an 84-year-old Chinese person named Du Yuanfa
 yuanpha pichley 56 saalon se bistar par padi apni patni jou yuai kii dekhbhaal kar rahe hai
 At the age of just 20, his wife's entire body was paralyzed
 patni ke liye naukari tak chhod diyuampha itane saalon se na sirf apni patni kaa khyaal rakh rahe hai balki jou kii dekhbhaal main koi kami na aae, isliye unhone apni naukari tak chhod di
 Du Yuanfa, who lives in Sunjiau, east China, quit his job as a coal minor in 1959, shortly after paralyzing his wife
 kuch hi maheene pehle hui thi shaadijis vakt jou ko lakva maaraa tha, usase paanch maheene pehle hi donon kii shaadi hui thi
 Yuanfa was working in a coal mine in the nearby city of Taiyuan and while there he received a letter that his wife was not well and she could not get up from bed
 jab wo ghar pahunche, to unhone paaya ki jou kaa puraa sharir akad gaya he or wo apane haath se bhi kisi saamaan ko nahin uthaa paa rahi hai
 Yuanfa was told that his wife would no longer be able to get up from bed all her life
 jab jou ke puure sharir ne kaam karnaa band kar diya to yuanpha ne tay kar liya tha ki puri jindagi patni kaa khyaal rakhenge
 Friends had said, settle down and other friends of Ghardu had advised them to get married second and move forward in life, but they did not listen to anyone
 iske baad unhone apni naukari chhod di or din-raat patni kaa khyaal rakhane lage
 What to do to fix a wife, what two farmers have been doing for the last 6 decades, so that they can feed themselves and their wife
 wo jou kokhud khaanaa khilaatehain, unke bedpan badalte hai, kapade badalte hai or har choti-choti cheez kaa khyaal rakhte hai
 He did not even know how many measures were taken to cure his wife, fed him with many Chinese medicines, visited the doctors and hospitals, but the silver lining was nowhere to be seen
 aaj bhi agar unhen patni kii beemaari thik karne ke liye koi aryuvedic nuskhaa bataata he, to yuanpha pahaado par jadi-bootiyaan talashne nikal jate hai

 According to Islamic law, Supreme Court will hear on the validity of marriage
 The lower court declared the marriage of Islamic law invalid The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the validity of
 supreme court ne us yachika par sunwaayee ke liye apni sahmati de di he, jisamen ek naaballig muslim ladki ne daawa kiya he ki usne muslim kanoon (sharia) ke hisaab se nikaah kiya he
 She has attained the age of puberty (menstruation) and is free to live her married life
 uttar pradesh kii ek ladki ne shaadi kii tay sanvaidhanik umr 18 saal hone se pehle kiye gaye apane vivaah ko vaid ghoshit karne kii is aadhaar par court se guhaar lagaai he ki islamic kaayade se 16 saal kii umr ko ladki kii shaadi ke laayak mana jaataa he lihaaja use vivaah karne kaa adhikaar he
 hc's decision challenged in Supreme Court The Allahabad High Court's decision on behalf of the woman was challenged in the Supreme Court
 hai court ne yuvati kii shaadi ko shunya qaraar dete hue use shelter home main bhejne kaa aadesh diya tha
 The petition filed in the Supreme Court against the verdict states that he is married
 aise main use daanpaty jivan basar karne kii ijaajat di jaae
 This case is related to Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh
 supreme court ke justise envi ramana, justise indira banerjee or justise ajay rastogi kii bench ne is maamle main daakhil arji par sunwaayee ke dauraan ise vistaar se sunne ke liye sahmati dete hue upi sarkaar ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga he ki kyon naa yachikakarta ko isaki ijaajat de di jaae
 While the High Court has declared marriage void
 nichali adaalat ne bheja shelter homeshaadi ke vakt ladki kii umr 16 saal bataae jane ke baad ayodhya kii nichali adaalat ne maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan aadesh diya ki ladki chunki naaballig he aise main use shelter home bheja jaae
 The girl filed an application in the Allahabad High Court and challenged the decision of the lower court
 lekin hai court ne bhi nichali adaalat ke faisle ko barkaraar rakhte hue kaha ki chunki yachikakarta ladki naaballig he or vah apane mata-pita ke saath nahin rahanaa chaahati, lihaaja use shelter home main bhejne kaa aadesh sahi he
 With this order, the High Court declared the marriage void
 pasand ke vyakti se shaadi karne main sakshamahai court ke aadesh ke khilaaf apni yachika main yuvati ne supreme court main daleel di ki islamic kanoon ke tahat koi bhi ladki amuman 16 saal kii aayu yani rajaswala hone par vah apni jindagi ke bare main nirnay lene ke liye swatantra he, yani vah apni pasand ke kisi bhi vyakti se shaadi karne main sakasham he
 In the SLP filed through her lawyer Dushyant Parashar, the woman has said that the High Court has failed to accept the fact that her marriage was done as per Muslim law
 yachika main ladki ne apane jeene, dharmik manyataon kaa paalan karne or swatantraaa ke adhikaar kii raksha ke liye daleel di he ki vah ek yuvak se prem karti he or is saal june main muslim kanoon ke anusaar unka nikaah ho chukaa he
 After this alleged marriage, the girl's father lodged a kidnapping case against the boy
 yuvati ke pita ne apni shikaayat main kaha ki ek yuvak ne apane saathiyon ke saath milakar uski beti kaa apharan kar liya he
 However, the girl in her statement filed before the magistrate said that she had married the person on her own free will
 vah uske hi saath rahanaa chaahati he
 The local court, in its judgment on June 24, said that according to Indian law, the girl has not attained the age of marriage and the court had referred the girl to the Child Welfare Committee, Bahraich till she attains the age of 18 years
 HC ne khaarij kii thi pati kii yachikis par ladki ke pati ne elahabaad hai court kii lakhanu bench ke saamne bandi pratyakshikaran yachika daakhil kii to bench ne ladki ke pati kii yachika yah kehete hue khaarij kar di ki juvenil justise (care and protection) act ke tahat ladki ko naaballig hi mana jayega
 So this marriage is invalid
 hai court ne nichali adaalat ke faisle se sahmati jataate hue ladki ko vuman shelter home bhej diya tha
 Now the Supreme Court will hear this dispute from a new perspective, that is, when the law of the country and which of Islamic law will apply to the Muslim population, it will also become clear

 It is worth noting that Bilour, while addressing the media in Peshawar on Saturday, said, 'I proclaim today that whoever kills this blasphemer and sinner who is talking nonsense about Prophet Muhammad, i will reward him with a million dollars
 
 ’’ State Department spokesman Muazzam Khan said that Railway Minister Ghulam Ahmad Bilour's declaration against the person making the anti-islam film was his personal view and it has nothing to do with the official policy of the Government of Pakistan

 aakhirkaar baba pakade hi gaye
 The end of the high voltage drama that had been going on for the last 18 days at exactly 9:21 pm on Wednesday night
 sant rampalko police ne hisar main uske usee ashram se giraftaar kar liya jis ashram ke aasapaas ke ilaake ko baba ne pichley kai dinon se jang kaa maidan bana rakhaa tha
 But Baba's arrest came after six people died, hundreds of injured and crores were spent
 lekin sabase bada sach yah ki jo baba itane dinon se kanoon ko thenga dikhaa rahaa tha, vahi baba jab pakadaa gaya to police ke aage gidgidaane laga ki use giraftaar naa kiya jaae wo khud court main sarender kar degaa
 After 18 days of hide-and-seek, spending more than 50 crores, six lives and paying the price of more than two hundred injured people, Haryana Police finally managed to arrest Sant Rampal by entering into his bill
 haryana police kaa sabase bada oparation mukammal hua
 In the ambulance, Baba is being taken directly from his ashram to Panchkula Hospital and then to Chandigarh
 chandigarh isliye taaki 21 november ko vahaan use hai court main pesh kiya ja sake
 This muscle was in a case of contempt
 magar giraftaar se bachane ke liye baba ne pichley 18 dinon main jo drama kiya, chah logon kii maut kii vajah bane, police ko choubison ghante ek pair par khadaa kiye rakhaa, uske baad ab usee adaalat main naa jane or kitni dhaaraon main baba lapete jane vaale hai
 The Haryana Police has registered a case of sedition against him
 dopaher main saaf ho gai thi tasweerbaba kii giraftaar beshak raat nau baj kar 21 minute par hui
 But the way of arrest was cleared only in the afternoon
 darasal tab police ne badi khamoshi se sant rampal kii patni, betaa or bhai ko ashram se giraftaar kar liya tha
 After this, everyone was also produced in court in a hurry
 ye khabar jaise hi baba ko lagi
 Baba panicked for the first time
 iske baad baba ne apane khaas logon ke jariye police tak paigaam bhijwaya ki wo sarender karne ko taiyaar hai magar court main
 Baba assured that on November 21, he himself would appear in court
 lekin tab tak bahut der ho chuki thi
 Police was troubled
 lihaaja haryana police ne saaf kar diya ki ab sarender kaa to sawaal hi paidaa nahi hota
 After this, Baba was informed about the sections registered against him and was told about the rebuke of the court
 isi ke baad baba ne kuch samay maanga, magar sarender karne ko phir bhi taiyaar nahin hue
 Meanwhile, and the paramilitary managed to enter the ashram around eight o'clock at night
 ashram ke andar tab kareeb do hajaar bhakt maujuud the
 The police took all the devotees with full precaution first and then finally caught Baba hidden among the devotees
 police sutron kii maane to giraftaar se bachane ke liye baba aakhri vakt tak apana cheharaa chhupate phir rahe the
 Even after being caught, he constantly kept pleading with the police not to arrest him, he would surrender himself before the court
 pichley 18 dinon se police ashram ke baahar deraa daalkar baba ke nikalne kaa intjaar karti rahi, lekin jab baba ko baat samaj main nahin ai to buudhvaar ko baba ke ashram par dhaava bol diya
 Baba made women and children so shield that six people lost their lives
 lekin baba the ki bas ashram main dubake rahe
 For the first time on Tuesday, after a long silence, the police was seen in some action
 aansu gas ke gole, lathi, dhamkee sab kuch bhaanja or aajamaaya par phir bhi wo nahin mila jiske liye ye sab kuch tha
 At night's work, Kalima of the night lost her water
 andhere main ashram par dhaava bolnaa khatre se khaali nahin tha
 The supporters of Rampal and his private army also started to slack due to the police stopping the operation
 raat dhal chuki thi
 Now the police played a wager
 hiden oparation kaa danvpulice ne giraftaar ke liye pehle to baton main ulajhaa kar rampal kii privet army ke kuch javaanon ko kaabo kiya or phir takreeban 200 javaanon ko pakad liya
 Now the police started waiting for further action in the morning
 19 november subah ke paanch baje rampal kii privet army ke javaanon ko pakadaney kii surat main police ko ek badi kamyaabi mil chuki thi
 Now all the jawans briefed and the police decided to run the operation again from ten o'clock
 isi bich police ne phir se mike par logon se baahar aane kii apil kii
 Since many people of Baba's private army had been caught in the night and the gate and wall of the ashram had been broken
 lihaaja logon ke baahar aane kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 By noon, thousands of people had been taken out of the ashram
 dopaher hote-hote police ne ek or chaal chali
 Suddenly rumors spread that Sant Rampal had been arrested
 ye sunate hi bahut se samarthak ghabara kar khud hi ashram se baahar aa gaye
 By the afternoon, around 15,000 supporters were claimed to have come out of the ashram
 baad main police ne sant ke bhai purushottam, patni, betaa or pravaktaa raaj kapur ko bhi giraftaar kar liya
 Then by nightfall, Baba himself finally came

 Sanjay Singh says that today Shivanand Tiwari has become the well-wisher of the Lalu family, but his main objective is to uproot the Lalu family from Bihar politics
 shivanand tiwari par tanj kasate hue sanjay singh ne kaha ki naa jane shivanand tiwari lalu parivaar se kis janm kaa badla le rahe hai, pehle unhone hi yachika daayar karke lalu ko jail bhijwaya or ab maraham laga rahe hai

 2018 main ek draft aayaa par kuch etraj hone kii vajah se us par dobaaraa kaam kiya gaya or is saal phir ek nayaa antim draft aa gaya he
 So, through this draft, will consumers be able to know how dangerous or how harmful their food is? Diet FSSAIK guidelines provide food companies with information about their products
 lekin upabhokta ko iske liye khaasaa samajhadaar hona padegaa

 phir yah hichkichaahat kyon?'' khurana poochhate hai, kitne log bharat main jaanate hai sodium namak hota he? aded sugar, trans fat jaisi shabdaawali kya saamaanya samaj ke vyakti ko samaj main aegi? khurana kii baat jamini hakeekat ke behad najadik najar aati he
 It is difficult to believe that at least one person sitting in the village will understand the first warning of food companies
