 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi has accused RJD leader and former Deputy Chief Minister of the state Tejashwi Yadav of tax evasion
 buudhvaar ko patrakaron ko sambodhit karte hue susheel modi ne khulaasa kiya ki tejasvi yadav kaa patna main keval 750 karod mal hi nahin ban rahaa tha, balki vah patna ke city ilaake main lara and sans naamak aayran and steel company bechney vaale pratishthan ke bhi maalik hai
 Sushil Modi alleged that Tejashwi Yadav's company had been working as a handling and storage agent of Delhi-based Jindal Steel and Power Limited Company since 2012

 Modi said that the warehouse of Lara & Sons, the company of Tejaswi, is located in Ranipur Window, Mirchai Road, Patna City
 tejasvi yadav kii company ko lekar susheel modi ne kaha ki unhen is baat par koi aapatti nahin he ki tejasvi vyapaar karte hai magar unhone sawaal uthaaya ki patna city ilaake main 2 acre or 25 dismil jameen jis par unki company kaa godaam bana hua he vah kiskaa he
 Sushil Modi questioned where did Tejashwi come from at the age of 28
 susheel modi ne sawaal uthaaya ki aakhir kyon tejasvi yadav ne is company ko lekar jaankaree chunavi halafname main nahin di? modi ne poocha ki tejasvi yadav jindal company ke liye agent ke rup main karodon rupye kaa vyapaar karte rahe, magar waite ritern main turnover shunya kyon dikhaaya?susheel modi ke aaropon kaa jawaab dete hue tejasvi yadav ne twit kiya
 Tejashwi said that if he is a man, he should get the entire case investigated
 tejasvi ne sawaal poocha ki kya vyapaar karnaa susheel modi ke baap-dadaon ke naam hi likhaa he?tejasvine likhaa ki nitish ji kii chor krupa se afawaah miyaan susheel modi hai to upmukhyamantri lekin jhooth bolne main duusare modi se koson aage hai
 Lied a lot of soil scam, now the department is with them

 Tejashwi wrote that both Nitish kumar-sushil Modi keep on talking loudly
 lekin janata kii taaqat he ki sabhi agency lagane ke baad bhi tejasvi kaa kuch nahin bigaad paae he kyonki tejasvi he to baccha lekin he sachcha
 Responding to the allegations of Sushil Modi, Tejashwi made many tweets, "sushilmodi, you are the ringleader, beating the chest and shouting that we are building a mall of 750 crores but your colleague and pet agency ED, IT is only 45" She is telling and will tell everything right in the court in the hearing

 com / 761bn18ysu — Shireen Mazari (@ shireenmazari1) December 16, 2019 Pakistan People's Party (PPP) chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari questioned the commission report on the APS attack
 unhone kaha ki ye report paanch saal baad tak bhi kyon jari nahin kii ja sakati he
 Bhutto said in his tweet, 'five years have passed since the APS attack and the guardians of the martyred students are still demanding justice
 ye makhul he ki APS kamishan report abhi tak jari nahin kii ja saki he
 It is the government's failure that justice has not been done yet
 ye maafee yogya nahin he ki NAP ko abhi tak lagu nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 5 years on from APS attack and the parents of the martyred students still demand justice
 Its a travesty that the APS commission report hasn’t been released
 It is a failure of the state that justice has not been served
 Its inexcusable that the NAP still isnt implemented 1 / 2— bilawalbhuttozardari (@bbhuttozardari)december 16, 2019jahaan tak skool ke chaatro or unke abhibhavakon kaa sawaal he to unhen skool kaa suutaravakya 'we shall rise again' bahut hausala detaa he

 goa main congress ne bijepi par asanvaidhanik tareeke se bahumat jutaney kaa aarope lagaaya he or governor kii bhoomika par sawaal uthaae hai
 On this issue, Congress mps created a ruckus in the Rajya Sabha on Friday
 sarkaar ne congress ke aaropon ko bebuniyaad qaraar diya he
 Despite being the largest party in Goa, the failure of the Congress to form the government, local leaders blamed on Goa in-charge Digvijay Singh without naming him
 jabaki digviyaj singh ne shuukravaar ko congress ke duusare saansadon ke saath rajyasabha main jam kar hangaamaa kiya or bijepi netaaon par gaiyr-kanoonee tareeke se jod-tod kar sarkaar banane kaa aarope laga diya
 Digvijay Singh told NDTV, "in Goa, Gadkari and Parrikar have committed robbery, stolen Mandet
 main poochta hum gadakari se, "aap jhola lekar gayi the usamen kitna saamaan le kar gayi the?" congress saansadon ne ek intervyuu main goa governor ke us bayaan par sawaal uthaaya jisamen unhone mana tha ki bijepi ko nyotaa dene se pehle unhone vitt mantri arun jetali se salaah lee thi
 The comments goa main satta haath se nikalne kii hataasha congress par rajyasabha main saaf taur par dikhaai di
 The question arose that when Manohar Parrikar had proved majority after the Supreme Court guidelines, the Congress did not delay in raising this issue in Parliament
 sadan main hangaame ke bich upasabhapati ne kaha governor kii bhoomika par kisi moshan par hi charchaa sambhav he
 But this did not affect the Congress mps and the house had to be adjourned
 sarkaar ne kaha, wo sadan main governor kii bhoomika par charchaa ke liye taiyaar he
 In fact, the question is also arising in the midst of this political tussle that why the Congress did not try to get the majority in time, like the BJP did
 digvijay singh ne enditivi se kaha, "goa main gadakari or parrikar ji ne dakaiti daali he, mandet kii chori kii he
 i ask Gadkari, "how many things did you carry in the bag?" Congress mps questioned Goa Governor's statement in an interview in which he admitted that he had consulted Finance Minister Arun Jaitley before inviting the BJP
 tippaniyan The desperation of power in Goa was clearly reflected in the Rajya Sabha on the Congress
 sawaal uthaa ki jab supreme court ke dishanirdesh ke baad manohar parrikar bahumat sabit kar chuke hai to is masale ko sansad main uthaane main congress ne deree to nahin kar di
 Amid the uproar in the House, the Deputy Chairman said that it is only possible to discuss any motion on the role of Governor
 lekin congress saansadon par iskaa koi asar nahin hua or sadan kii kaarywahi sthagit kerani padi
 The government said, it is ready to discuss the role of the governor in the House

 Companies argue that this will enable passengers to get a better network and will be able to talk to their people without any hindrance
 steshnon ke saath saath rail safar ke dauraan kaise behatar network muhaiyaa karaayaa ja saktaa he is par bhi rail mantralay, telecom regulator tri ke saath milakar vichaar kar rahaa he
 According to official sources, the Ministry of Railways is going to bring a new policy in the name of increasing connectivity for mobile towers
 is policy ke tahat sabhi telecom operataron ek saamaan kiraye par steshnon par jagah lij par di jaaegi
 Railway officials believe that this step will give two major benefits to the railways, first, the convenience of passengers and secondly the boost in non-fair revenue

 At the same time, Kanhaiya Kumar appealed to the youth to participate in the voting

 kanhaiya kumaar se jab poocha gaya ki aapaki ladaai kisase he to unhone kaha, 'hamaari ladaai unase he jinhone begusarai kii dharti ko apamaanit karne kaa kaam kiya he
 Our fight is directly against the government with those masks which do not work, which only serve to discredit our opponents
 'jab kanhaiya kumaar se sawaal kiya gaya ki begusarai main rashtrawaad kaa mudda kitna haaavee rahegaa, iske jawaab main kanhaiya ne kaha ki 'sidhe taur par begusarai se ye sandesh jayega ki loktantr main logon kaa ahm sawaal hona chahie
 Misleading people is a new conspiracy

 aisa aarope lag rahaa he ki raigarh ke pen main sthit unke farm house main chah hatyaon ko anjaam diya gaya tha
 The police has not solved this murder mystery till date
 haalanki, ye farm house ranjit ne ab bech diya he
 But during the discussion of Sheena case, this incident has become fresh in the minds of the local people
 sthaneey logon ke mutabik, 1986 or 1992 main ranjit ke is farm house main teen-teen logon kii sansanikhej hatya kar di gai thi
 Moru Patil, a resident of Gagode village killed in this, has been identified, but the identity of the remaining dead has not been identified till date
 police kii jaanch bhi puri nahin ho saki he
 This murder mystery has once again raised questions on the Raigad police
 farm main house main 6 logon kii hui thi hatyaranjit kaa ye farm house pen khopoli road ke gagode gaanv par bilkul sadak kinare sthit he
 In 1986, three people working here were killed
 iske baad 1992 main bhi is farm house main kaam karne vaale teen or logon kii chaaku se godakar hatya kar di gai thi
 No arrests have been made so far in this case
 na hi police is murder mistry ko sulajhaa pai he
 The then CM had given the inquiry, Vaishali Patil said that the then CM Manohar Joshi had given the assurance of investigation, but the trust could not be turned into reality till date
 ab shina kii hatya kii gutthi sulajhane ke baad ek phir baar gaanv ke log yah ummid kar rahe he ki 1986 or 1992 main hui hatya ke maamle main police tahakikat kare or iskaa khulaasa kare
 Raigad Police Police, which is under investigation afresh, says that this matter has come to their notice
 baraamad kiye gaye shav kii jaanch ke saath is maamle kii tahakikat ke aaladhikariyon ne nirdesh die hai
 a police officer has also been given responsibility for this
 police team is maamle kii jaanch main lag gai he
 This case will be resolved soon
 haalanki, vaishali kaa daawa he ki siem ke aadesh ke baad bhi espi ne is cese ko band kar diya tha
 The BJP national executive meeting is starting in Goa today and all eyes are on Narendra Modi
 sabko intjaar he ki kab narendra modi ko kaman saunpane kii ghoshnaa hogi
 However, there are differences within the BJP as well
 in matbhedon ko bijepi alaakaman ne jitna sulajhane kii koshish kii he, utana hi ulajhate bhi gaye hai
 The question is, will the story, which started in 2002, be written in its original screenplay in 2013? Narendra Modi was also the question in bjp's national session in 2002 and after 11 years in 2013 (goa session), the question will be Modi
 2002 main sawaal tha ki narendra modi ko rajdharm ke liye gujarat ke siem kaa pad chhodana chahie, 2013 main modi ko 2014 kii kaman saunpane kaa sawaal he
 In 2002, Modi's followers laid such a position that Modi's throne remained intact and it was believed that in 2002, Rajdharma was defeated and Modi won
 vahiin, 2013 main ab modi ke liye red karpet dilli main to bich chukaa he, lekin is par modi chalenge kab, is aas main goa adhiveshavan shuru ho rahaa he
 And the question is once again Modi
 2002 ke vakt gujarat dangon ko bijepi pachaa nahin paa rahi thi, kyonki us vakt centre main bijepi kii hi aguwai main endie kii sarkaar thi, par 2013 main bijepi ko modi kii aguwai isliye chahie, kyonki vah centre kii satta par kabiz hona chaahati he
 That is, Modi, who was a stain for the Vajpayee government in 2002, has become the trump card to bring the BJP to power in 2013
 modi ne 2014 ke mishan kii kaman thami to bijepi ke saansadon kii sankhya badhegi, lekin bijepi ke bheetar kaa antardvandv is baat kaa he ki modi ke aane se siten to badhati hai lekin satta phir bhi dur rahati he
 That is, the BJP should also support those allies who stood with the BJP by putting Ayodhya, Kaman Civil Code and Article 370 on hold
 isaliye sawaal yah he ki 2002 main kaman atal bihari vaajapeyi ke paas thi, jo modi ko rajgharm kaa paath padhaa rahe the or 2013 main bijepi modi kii sawari karne ja rahi he, jahaan gujarat se aage ke modi ke rajgharm kii nai patakatha kaa intjaar har koi kar rahaa he
 In the current era, Narendra Modi has become a bigger question than Goa
 modi ko lekar bijepi ke bheetar to sawaal he hi, sahyogi dal bhi ise baar-baar uthaate rahe hai
 Therefore, what will be the strategy in Goa on Modi, the country's eyes are constantly on it
 pichley saal july main mumbai hamale ke mastermind zaki-ur-rahamaan lathvi ko pakistan reeha kar rahaa tha or bharat ne sanyukt raashtra main padosi desh ke is kadam par aapatti uthaai thi
 At that time, China also complicated the matter by saying that Pakistan's decision has been taken on the basis of 'facts and impartiality'
 iske saath hi bijing ne yah bhi kaha tha ki vah lagaataar nai dilli se sampark main he
 It is just a matter of few more days

 Raksha and her husband Raghubhai Narangbhai Bolia have been associated with the party for the last three decades
 haal main sthaneey nikaay chunaav ke baad narendra modi ne raksha ke naam ko bataur meyar anumati de di
 The new mayor of Rajkot associates this pride with the principle of party equality
 unke mutabik narendra modi ne dikhaa diya ki bijepi main amir or garib ke bich koi fark nahin hota
 Hard working workers like us have got recognition for their work
 raksha ke pati bhi is maukey par party kaa gungan karte hai
 Raksha and Raghu got married in 1995
 ab tak ve do kamaron vaale makaan main rahete the
 But soon the family will shift to the mayor's bungalow
 raksha ko istemaal ke liye sarkari gaadi milegi
 On the other hand, Raghu will continue to drive auto to drive home

 The Mumbai ATS suffered a lot of embarrassment when it was revealed during the hearing that Abdul Samad, an accused arrested from Mangalore, never visited Pune

 The subsequent blasts — the Chinnaswamy cricket stadium in Bangalore in April 2010, the Jama Masjid blast in September 2010 to the Shitala Ghat in Varanasi in December 2010 and the serial blasts in Mumbai in July 2011 — were not solved

 ehsaan ne donon samoohon ke media abhiyaan kaa bhi netritv kiya he
 What Ehsanullah Ehsan said: Ehsan has accused India's intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and Afghanistan's NDS of aiding the Pakistani Taliban
 ehsaan ne kaha ki 'endies or ro ke saath sambandh tab bade, jab pakistan kii sena ne 2014 main uttari wajiristaan main apane gadhon main taliban ke khilaaf ek pramukh sainya abhiyaan shuru kiya
 After which the terrorists were forced to flee across the border of Afghanistan
 ehsaan ne video main kaha ki unako aarthik madad ke saath-saath target bhi diya jaataa tha, or har atake par unako paise bhi milte the
 The media is yet to confirm the claim of favor
 afghanistan ke ek varisht adhikari ne ehsaan ke is daawey kaa khandan kiya he
 He said that 'pakistan has always been describing itself as a victim of terrorism, whereas the truth is different
 pakistan hameshaa bharat or afghanistan main aatankwaad kaa samarthan karata rahaa he
 Now that Pakistan is facing a lot of pressure from the international community, in such a situation, it is calling itself a victim and trying to avoid responsibility
 jammu kashmir ke army base camppar hue hamale ke baad bharat ne pakistan ko alag-thalag karne ke liye ek rajanyik abhiyaan chalaaya he
 At the same time, America is also pressuring Pakistan to deal with the Haqani network
 ehsaan ne kaha ki afghanistan kii endies agency aatankwaadiyon ko pahchaan patr pradaan karke unki madad karti thi
 Their movement ran with the blessings of NDS and Afghan forces

 desh aazaadee kii 70veen saalagirah manaa rahaa he
 In the world's greatest republic, we are free to live our own free will
 lekin aaj bhi bharat jaise mahaan desh main behatar shiksha swasthya jaisi moolbhoot suvidhaayen har kisi ke boote ke baahar he
 The one who is rich has better facilities, the one who is not rich, somehow lives on
 aazaadee kii 70veen saalagirah par dilli ke sarkari skulon ne rajdhani main rahane vaale hajaaron un mata-pitaaon ko yah aazaadee di he ki ab vah apane bacchon ko mahange nijee skulon se nikaalkar aadhunik chamchamaate sarkari skulon main muft shiksha de saken
 The condition of government schools in Delhi is now changing
 is swatantraaa diwas par rajdhani ke sarkari skulon ne dilli ke abhibhavakon ko apane bacchon ko muft main behatar shiksha kii aazaadee di he
 The Delhi government claims that so far thousands of children have been enrolled in government schools after getting their names dropped from private schools
 aaie samajhane kii koshish karte hai ki aakhir is badlaav ke peeche vajah kya he
 It is a Government Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Sector 21 of Rohini area of delhi
 isi saal april main nae banakar taiyaar hue 18 sarkari skulon main se is vidhyalay main lagbhag 1200 bachche padhate hai
 But the picture that is most interesting is that out of these 12 children, about 900 children were those who studied in private schools built in Rohini and its surrounding areas till the first of April, but this year these 900 children took names from private schools
 Is enrolled in schools
 sunne main yah naammumkin sa lagata he lekin rajdhani ke sarkari skulon ne is naammumkin ko mumkin kar dikhaaya he
 The new magnificent building competes with any private school
 aadhunik class room or behtareen suvidhaayen in bacchon ko yah ehsaas nahin hone detii ki ab vah kisi nijee skool main padhate hai yaa phir avadharana main badnaam sarkari skulon main
 According to the school's Principal Dr
 Sukhbir Yadav, about 900 children have enrolled in this new government schools which till now were studied in private schools
 sarkaar ne behatar skool die hai or ham in skulon main behatar shiksha dene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The logo on uniform uniforms like private schools is giving a confidence to these children studying in government schools
 lekin us kaaran ko bhi jaananaa jaruri he ki aakhir yah aazaadee aam aadmi ke liye itani mahatvapurn kyon he
 Most students enrolled in private schools to government schools believe that the huge fees charged by private schools were a headache for their parents
 lekin kya aarthik tangi ke chalate bacchon kii adhyayan kii gunvattta se samjhauta kiya gaya? zyaadaatar chaatr is tarah se sahamat hai or kehete hai ki unhen in sarkari skulon main vahi tali mil rahi he jaisi pichley skulon main milti thi
 School students told that we are also being given good education in this school
 padhai-likhaai nijee skulon ke mukaable jaraa bhi kam nahin he
 There are more opportunities to play and play
 baat-baat main 'aaj tak' kii team ne itihaas kii kaksha main baithe chaatro se rome samrajya kaa itihaas bhi puch liya
 See how the students answered every question instantly
 rohinee ke sector 22 main bhi isi saal april se nayaa sarkari skool shuru hua he
 About 800 children have enrolled in government schools from primary to 12th, after being enrolled in private schools
 dilli sarkaar ke aankadon ki agar maane to is saal se shuru hue nae aadhunik skulon main hajaaron bacchon ne nijee skulon se naam katwakar sarkari skulon main daakhila liya he
 Delhi Deputy Chief Minister and Education Minister Manish Sisodia is very happy with these students coming to government schools
 shikshaamantri kehete hai ki unhone bacchon ko har vah behatar suvidhaayen dene kii koshish kii he jo koi nijee skool bhi nahin de saktaa
 The Aaj Tak team reached the Government Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's ITO area to find out how much truth is there in the Kejriwal government's claims of bringing revolution in government schools
 dilli sarkaarne kaha tha ki vah pratham charan main dilli ke maujuuda sarkari skulon main se 54 sarkari skulon ko model skool banane par kaam kar rahi he
 The Government Sarvodaya Vidyalaya at ITO is one of the model schools
 skool kii choukhat paar karte hi ek shandaar imaarat swaagat karti najar aati he
 Principal of the school, Dr
 Devendra also told that this year too many children in their schools have enrolled in this government school after getting their names removed from private schools
 or yahaan par bhi jo sabase bada kaaran saamne aayaa vah tha madhyam varg ke saamne chunauti bani aarthik tangi thi
 Dr
 Devendra, Principal of Rouse Avenue, Government School, said, “many children in our schools have also enrolled themselves from private schools
 nijee skulon kii mahangi fees kai mata-pita ke liye mushkil thi
 But more than that it is necessary to provide the best facilities in government schools which the government is doing and we are trying to provide the best and modern education with those facilities
 "nijee skulon ke mahange fees ke saamne ghutane teke abhibhavakon ne bacchon kaa naam sarkari skulon main to likhva diya lekin kahin yah muft shiksha kii aazaadee unke bacchon ke liye mahangi to nahin he?is sawaal kaa jawaab sirf is skool kii imaarat nahin balki iske classroom dete hai
 Looking at the excellent fiber benches to sit on and smart boards and computer projectors for teaching, it is as if sitting in the class room of an IIT or IIM
 vyaayaam ke liye aadhunik gym bhi hai to pratibha nikhaarane ke liye painting kii vishesh classroom bhi
 There is also a special classroom for computer education, which is most important for modern education, where children are taught computers through projectors
 skill deveopment kii shiksha ke liye is skool main puraa guide kaa course bhi he or uske liye vishesh classroom bhi hai
 Millions of children study in more than one thousand government schools of Delhi
 samrudh parivaar zyaadaatar apane bacchon ko mahange nijee skulon main daakhila dilaate hai kyonki sarkari skulon ke ko lekar samaaj main avadharana thik nahin he
 Even after 70 years of independence, every common man has probably not got the best facilities for health and education
 dilli main ek rasta dikhaaya he or yahaan par kam se kam aamadani vaale madhyamvarg ko bhi behtareen shiksha ke maamle main vah aazaadee jarur mil rahi he
 The team adorned with star players lost by 6 wickets against New Zealand in the India World Cup warm-up match
 kiviyon ke khilaaf is haar se world cap jeetne kaa sapana lekar aane vaali viraat brigade kii ummiido ko karaara jhatka laga he
 The defeat exposed the preparations of the Indian team
 team india ko jaisi shuruyaat kii ummid thi, vaisaa nahin ho paaya
 It was Ravindra Jadeja, whose half-century (54 runs) helped India cross 150
 team india 39
 All out for 179 in 2 overs and New Zealand got a target of 180
 bharat kaa ek samay 100 ranon tak janaa mushkil rahaa tha lekin rabindra jadeja ne ant main 50 gendon par 54 ranon kii pari khel team kii laaj bachaai
 In this, Kuldeep Yadav (19) also supported him well
 aaie ek najar daalate hai team india kii haar ke kaarnon par:1
 Failure of Rohit and Dhawan: India's debut in this match was very bad
 jis baat kii chintaa bhartiya ballebaajon ko lekar ho rahi thi wo abhyaas match main sahi sabit hui
 Indian batsmen danced in front of Trent Bolt's swing
 shuruyaat rohit sharma (2) se hui jo bolt kii gend par elbeadblyoo ho gaye
 Shikhar Dhawan (2) also became the victim of Bolt
 bolt ne apane pehle spel main rohit, shikhar or rahul ko pavilion bhej diya jo badalon se bhare mausam main nirnaayak sabit hua
 Lack of footwork was evident in the batsmen
 bolt ne rohit ko behtareen swing par out kiya jabaki dhawan balle ke andruni hisse par bouns hoti gend lagane se pavilion laute
 2
 viraat kohli kaa out hona:captain viraat kohli (24 gend main 18 ran) ko colin di grandehome ne of kattar se out kiya
 Kohli was bowled at the ball of Grandhom
 kohli agar krij par khadey rahete to tasviir alag ho sakati thi
 After Kohli's dismissal, the pressure came to the middle order
 3
 Dhoni and Pandya failed: Dhoni and Pandya were at the crease after the middle order falter
 hardik pandya (37 gend main 30 ran) ne mahendra singh dhoni ke saath paanchaven wicket ke liye 38 ran jode
 The innings of Dhoni (17 off 42 balls) was ended by Tim Southee, he was caught on short mid-wicket
 vah krij par sahaj nahin dikhe or saajhedaari ke dauraan strike rotate karne main bhi vifal rahe
 Jimmy Neesham (3 for 26 in three overs) took the wicket of Hardik Pandya
 paristhitiyon ko dekhte hue hardik ko dhoni se pehle ballebaaji ke liye bheja gaya tha
 4
 gendbaajon kaa flop sho:jis pich par newjiland ke gendbaajon ne bhartiya ballebaajon ko pair jamaane tak kaa mauka nahin diya usee pich par bumraah, bhubaneshwar or shami kuch khaas nahin kar paae
 Spin bowlers were also in the same situation
 ken williamson or ross tailor ne 114 ranon kii saajhedaari kar team india ko match se baahar kar diya

 jammu-kashmir ke kupwada main aatankwaadiyon ne army camp par aatmghaatee hamalaa kiya he
 Three Indian soldiers were killed in this, while two terrorists have been killed
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir (pioke) main border ke paas kareeb 150 aatankwaadi ghati main ghuspaith ke liye intjaar main hai
 The attack is being planned to divert the attention of the Indian Army through this attack
 sutron ke mutabik, pioke se ISI dwaara aatankiyon ko nirdesh diya ja rahaa he ki ve jammu-kashmir main sthit army camp or mobile communication tower ko nishaanaa banaaen
 The terrorists are angry due to the shutdown of mobile internet in the state
 isliye seemapar se aatankiyon ko is baat kaa badla lene kaa nirdesh diya ja rahaa he
 At the same time, there is an alert of terrorist attack on Jammu and Kashmir court, shifting from Jammu to Srinagar on 28 April
 kashmir ghati main suraksha ke liye jimmedaar srinagar sthit 15veen kor ke commander leftinent general je es sandhu ne kaha ki aatankwaadiyon ke ghuspaith ke is prayaas ko vifal kar diya jayega
 There will be some more terrorists in the terrorist camps in the occupied areas of Pakistan opposite Poonch and Razauri in Jammu
 ek anumaan ke anusaar bhartiya kshetra 15veen kor main vartmaan samay main kareeb 150 aatankwaadi maujuud hai
 Lt Sandhu said that infiltration from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir across the Line of Control has been lower this year than last year
 pichley varsh ghuspaith adhik thi
 So far this year we have been successful in stopping the intruders
 barf ne bhi hamaari madad kii he
 More snowfall this year has made it harder for militants to infiltrate
 ham unhen rokna jari rakhenge taaki aatankwaad nahin badhane paae
 The army is ready
 bataate chalem ki soshal media par aatankiyon kaa ek video kaaphi viral ho rahaa he
 More than 30 terrorists are seen carrying weapons in army uniform
 aatankwaadi bullate pruf jacket pahane hai
 They have ak-47s in their hands
 aatankiyon kaa yah video dakshini kashmir ke kisi jagah par banaaya gaya he
 The Indian Army has expressed concern over videos of terrorists coming on social media and violence in the Valley
 bataaya gaya he ki aatankiyon ne yevideo soshal mediaper ek agenda ke tahat share kiya he
 The purpose of releasing the video is to show its presence in South Kashmir
 video main kareeb 30 kii sankhya main aatanki khuleam hathiyaar lekar ghoomte dikhaai de rahe hai
 It is also surprising that this is the first time in the last 20 years that such a number of terrorists have been seen together

 apane aap main khaas ek din jo bacchon ko samarpit hota he
 Thousands of events are organized across the country on this occasion
 bade-bade manch sajte hai
 Leaders, actors, social reformers, ngos are crowded
 mere haq main badi-badi baaten hoti hai
 People tell what they are doing for the betterment of my people and what are their intentions in future
 main nakaaratmak nahin hum, natmastak hum, unke aage jo is disha main insaani dayitvon kaa nirvahan karte hue apni manushyata ko sarthak kar rahe hai
 But i also recognize the crowd standing in this area, who have arrived here for their personal selfishness and appearance
 khabaron main bane rahane ke liye, tasviren khinchvaane ke liye or khud ko bada bataane-jataane ke makasad se bahuterey dhong karne vaale log in aayojanon main shaamil hote hai
 These people claim to save childhood, win statistics and include those who are clad in big dresses
 samaaj ke tathakthith sudharko, tumne mujhe janaa hi kab tha? meri ankhon ko padhane kii, mere jajbaton ko samajhane kii koshish bhi kab kii thi? tum bhi shoshak ho mere, kya jaanate nahin? yaa phir jaanakar sach se munh churaana chaahate ho? tum jin bhawanon main rahete ho uski neenv kii iten maine hi to sajaai thim
 In the star buildings of which you reach the end of hunger and craving, my beautiful hands rub the beautiful and hard utensils placed in a corner, all the while tolerating beatings, scorn and abuses
 lekin tumhaare paas kab samay rahaa, un andheron main jhaankne kaa
 You kept buying happiness with money, i kept filling your stomach
 sadiyon se yahi silsilaa to he
 Never mind, in the tinkle of bangles, in the glow of saris, in the glow of shoes, in every decoration of you, my hard work and compulsion is reflected
 tumhaari jamaat main wo log bhi shaamil hai jo meri bebasii ko chand sikkon main taulakar chal dete hai
 People like this kind of beggar who begging me and doing rains of rain are also strange
 aisa karke yah apni najaron main mahaan banate hai or khuda, bhagwaan yaa ishwar se darate hue santosh kii sukhad bhaavana se rubaru hone kaa dhong bhi karte hai
 Goya thrown coins will replace my destiny
 
 
 khayr apni-apni kismat he, tum gunahagaari ke purna viraam ko sire se khaarij bhi kar sakate ho
 You can define this inequality with your hard work and my bad luck, you can blame only governments for my plight
 lekin meraa sawaal he ki tum bhi to samaaj ho? or tum samaaj kaa hissaa ho to bataao ki mere jaise lakhon ke liye tumne vastav main kya kiya?main un bacchon ko bade gaur se dekhtaa hum jo dharti par suraj kii kirane padate hi kitaab, copy or baste lekar skool kii ore chal padate hai
 i like them very much in their clean, bathed, washed, washed clothes
 thik usee vakt unheen bacchon ke daaen-baayen, aage-peeche main bhi najar aauungaa
 Pouring foil in the garbage, adding punctures, washing dishes at the tea breakfast shop, tolerating the smoke coming from the eyes, venting the fire furnace
 jinda rahane ke liye, pet kii bhukh mitaane ke liye, yah sab karnaa meri majaburi hi to he
 To tell the truth, my heart cries when i see children going to school
 haath main pani kii bottle or peeth par bastaa lekar main bhi inke saath padhane janaa chahta hum
 But who has the time to understand this desire and look into my conscience? Remember that i have the right over paper, pen, medicine and my feet are eager to climb the school stairs
 kaksha kii ek seat meri bhi he
 But i was prevented from going to those classes
 mere haathon main pen, pencil kii jagah kuch or pakadaa diya gaya
 i see a lot of rules and regulations around me
 yah mat karo, wo mat karo, aisa nahin kar sakate, yah kar sakate ho, vah nahin kar sakate
 
 
 Where are these rules makers? i want to ask them why i am not involved in these? Yes, i know that some rules and laws are also for me
 lekin phir ek sawaal ki vah itane bhothere kyon hai? mere jaison ke liye nishprabhavi se kyon hai?chunaav jeetne vaale netaa or sarkarein apni jeet kaa dambh bhar sakate hai, atmamugdh ho sakate hai, lekin jab vah apni antaratma ko khangaalenge to unke paas mere sawaalon kaa koi jawaab nahin hoga
 Big speeches will remain heroic
 shaayad mere din to biit gaye lekin tumhaare paas ab bhi mauka he
 Take care of the coming generations who, like me, will stand in the back row and ask you questions
 or tum khud ko badal nahin paae to us vakt bhi tumhaare hont sile honge
 Happy Birthday to you for the moment

 jabalpur loksabhaa kshetra ke saansad rakesh singh ko 18 april ko bhaajapa kaa nayaa pradesh adhyaksh banaaya gaya to yah saaf ho gaya ki mukhyamantrishivraj singh chouhandilli sthit party alaakaman se apni baat manwaane main safal ho gaye hai
 Former state party chief Nandkumar Singh Chauhan was known to have "seemed determined" only when the party suffered defeat in the recent assembly by-elections of Mungaoli and Kolaras
 ab rakesh singh ke is pad par aane se pataa chalata he ki mahatvapurn chunavi varsh main bhagava netritv koi bhi jokhim lene ko taiyaar nahin he
 His selection also matters because about half a dozen state leaders were lobbying for the post, including state ministers Narottam Mishra and Lal Singh Arya and former Union Minister Fagan Singh Kulaste
 inke alaava rashtriya mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey or purv kendriya mantri prahlaad patel bhi daud main the, lekin mukhyamantri se talkh rishton kii vajah se in logon ke naam par vichaar karnaa sambhav hi nahin tha
 It also shows how much the party high command is currently paying attention to the Chief Minister
 bataaya jaataa he ki mukhyamantri chouhan narendra singh tomars ko teesri baar is pad par laane ke icchhuk the
 The tomar-chauhan duo had won two elections in 2008 and 2013
 tomars philhal centre main gramin vikaas, panchayat raaj or khanan vibhaag ke mantri hai or satta ke galiyaaron main charchaa he ki unhone iske liye manaa kar diya
 But the Chief Minister did not want to lose him
 so, unhone yah aashwast kiya ki bhaajapa kii rajya chunaav cameti main tomars bhi ek sanyojak ke rup main bane rahen or apni salaah se party kii sambhaavnaaon ko majboot banaate rahe
 The first major break was given by the new president of the party Rakesh Singh by Uma Bharti during his Chief Minister's term
 unhone 2004 main jabalpur loksabhaa seat se unki ummidavaari kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Rakesh Singh is also considered close to former Union Minister and MP from Damoh, Prahlad Patel
 donon ne chaatr raajnneeti main ek saath pravesh kiya tha or kaaphi kaam saath-saath kiya he
 However, critics of Rakesh Singh say that there is no point in bringing him just a few months before the election, because it is too late now
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki maharashtra bhaajapa ke sah-prabharee kii pari ke alaava rakesh singh kaa or koi khaas sanghathanaatmak anubhav nahin he
 Then it will not be easy to keep all the factions in the party united in the state
 isliye unke liye kai lakshya taiyaar hai, jinamein pehla hoga aisi siton kii pahchaan karnaa jinke maujuuda vidhayakon kaa patta kaatna he
 The new state BJP chief will have to show some activism in this matter so that there is at least a revolt in the ticket distribution for the assembly elections to be held later this year
 nae adhyaksh ko kuch aaazaad tareeke se kaam karnaa siikhnaa hoga, bajaae mukhyamantri ke "bhompu'' ban jane ke
 He has taken care of superiors like Babulal Gaur and Sartaj Singh
 yah sanket dete hue ki ve jaanate hai ki unhen kya karnaa he
 While taking charge Rakesh Singh said, "I met Sartaj Singh ji
 
 
 bhaajapa ke sabhi kaaryakarta agle chunaavon ke liye milakar kaam karenge

 Another name is going to be added to the ongoing controversy over the renaming of cities
 upi kii yogi sarkaar ke baad himachal pradesh kii bijepi sarkaarshimlaka naam badalane par vichaar kar rahi he
 The BJP government of Himachal is going to bring a proposal to rename Shimla
 bhashaa ke mutabik kuch hinduvadi sanghathan shimla kaa naam badalane ke liye pichley kuch samay se abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 Health Minister Vipin Singh Parmar in Himachal government says that many cities in the country have been named on mythological basis
 isi aadhaar par agar log shimla kaa naam shyamala karne kii maang kar rahe hai to is babat prastaav laayaa ja saktaa he
 Recently, after the name of the historic city of Allahabad, Prayagraj, there has been a debate in social media
 kuch log naam badalane ke faisle ko sahi maan rahe hai, to vahiin kuch log aise faisle kaa virodh bhi kar rahe hai
 People who justify the change of name believe that if a city is named on the basis of historical importance then there is no harm in it
 vahiin, virodh karne waalon kaa tark he ki aisa karnaa itihaas ke saath chhedchhad he
 Himachal Pradesh Congress leader Harbhajan Singh Bhajji has questioned the government's decision
 unhone kaha ki shimla ek aitihaasik shahar he
 What do you want to prove by changing its name
 bhajji ne sawaal kiya ki shimla naam main kya buraai he
 Will the development work be speeded up by changing its name? unhone kaha ki sarkaar ko naam badalane kii bajaae rajya ke vikaas kaary par dhyaan dena chahie
 Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Aman Puri says that Shimla was earlier named Shyamala
 angrejon ne apni sahuuliyat ke hisaab se iskaa naam simla rakhaa, jise baad main shimla kar diya gaya
 Now there is nothing wrong in bringing it back to its old name Shyamala
 shimla ko 1864 main angrejon ne apni greeshmakaleen rajdhani bana lee thi

 When someone is in love, often people drift back and forth in a thunderstorm of love
 aisa hone main koi buraai bhi nahin kyonki pyaar se zyada behtareen anubhav koi or ho hi nahin saktaa lekin kabhi pyaar main andhe hokar koi kadam na uthaanaa hi bhavishya ke liye acha hota he
 Sometimes it is just physical attraction, so knowing a few things can save you from the deception of love
 in paanch baton se jaaniye ki kya aapako partner aapse sach main pyaar karata he yaa phir baat kuch or he
 
 
 1
 aapaki yaad unhen sirf raat main aati he vakt kii kami to aaj har kisi ke paas he lekin ham jinase pyaar karte hai or care karte hai unke liye ham samay nikaal hi lete hai
 Be alert if your partner only calls you at night
 2
 Talk does not even begin and if he starts talking to you directly on the topic of sex, be careful he talks to you for sex, not for love
 3
 As soon as you talk to him on future plans, he always changes the topic because he is bound by physical attraction
 4
 He is often busy during the day, but whenever you talk to meet him, if he talks about walking outside at night, then be emotional and think before you know anywhere
 5
 Even if he praises your beauty and body at all times, it is better to leave such a partner as soon as possible
 kyonki vah sirf aapako yuj karnaa chahta he or kuch nahin

 India had proposed increasing connectivity between SAARC countries, which Pakistan is opposing

 If Sharif is adamant, it will be one of the few SAARC conferences in which no agreement has been signed

 Samajwadi Party national president Mulayam Singh Yadav was clearing the party's stance on the reservation bill in front of journalists at the state headquarters at 5 pm on Vikramaditya Marg in Lucknow
 ve kah rahe the ki yah bill sarkari naukari main asamanta paidaa karne vaala he
 But 24 hours before his claims, the results of the main examination of the Provincial Civil Service (PCS) 2011, which came on July 4, presented the opposite picture
 lok seva ayog, elahabaad ne pisies mukhya pariksha main kul 1,316 abhyarthiyon ko safal ghoshit kar unhen intervyuu ke liye bulaayaa
 Within ten days, it came to light that the number of upper caste candidates called for interview is not more than 250
 jabaki puraani vyavastha ke mutabik yah sankhya 650 ke aasapaas honi chahie thi
 Actually all this happened with the resolution passed in haste on 27 May 2013
 is din upipiessi ke sachiv anil kumaar yadav ne ayog ke sadsy gurdarshan singh ke us prastaav ko manjuuri de di jisamen pisies sahit sabhi parikshaon main prilims, mens or intervyuu teenon str par overlaping kii ijaajat he
 After this proposal, 50 percent reservation and 50 percent general or even upper caste quota seats were allowed to claim the remaining classes at every level
 jabaki puraani vyavastha main intervyuu ke str par hi overlaping kii ijaajat thi
 "virtually unreserved vacancy is not reserved for anyone and relative to such vacancies, the merit list of all categories of candidates should be called for interview in proportion to the standard prescribed for the post in question," the proposal said
 ’’pisies mens ke parinaam kaa postmortem chal hi rahaa tha ki upipisies kii kuch anya parikshaon ke parinaamon ke jaateey sameekaran saamne aae
 Such as the UP Government Degree College Screening Examination 2007, in which the results of the examination for the post of spokesperson in the subject of Botany and Homescience were announced on 15 June
 sidhe intervyuu ke jariye 23 june ko aae lok nirmaan vibhaag pariksha ke nateezon main junior ejeeniyar (computer) ke 48 padon par hui bhartee main obisi ke hisse main 28 pad (yadav 20 pad) or saamaanya varg kii shrenee main 11 pad ( brahman 6 pad) aae
 At the same time, Muslims could get only two posts
 rajkeey mahavidhyalay main pravaktaa samajashaastra ke liye jab 19 padon par bhartiyon huin, to saamaanya varg kii 9 siton main se 4 siten phir se anya pichhadaa varg se taalluk rakhane vaali yadav jati ke khate main chali gayi
 During this period, the share of Muslims in most of the appointments also remained low
 musalamaanon kii bekadri, kya sapa ke chunavi vaadon se mail khaati he
 sp's biggest Muslim face and Urban Development Minister Azam Khan pointed out, "neither do i know about the change in policy nor i am asked before making policy
" ’’ maamle par bijepi or bispi ne bhi apane hont si rakhe hai
 "the tone of the national president of Sarvajan Hitay Patraksha Samiti has also changed this time," the reservation should not be more than 50 per cent
 overlaping se agar isamen badlaav hota he to yah asanvaidhanik he
 The leader remained silent, but the students were agitated
 jab ayog ke sachiv ne unhen milane kaa samay nahin diya to maamla or bhadak gaya
 On July 15, the students vandalized
 elahabaad shahar main dukaanon or baso main todfod hui
 The house of a SP MLA was also vandalized
 ab chaatr hycourt main 23 july ko is maamle par hone vaali sunwaayee ke baad aage kii ranneeti tay karenge
 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is also silent on the plea that the matter be in the High Court
 lekin sapa jaan rahi he ki halaat thik nahin hai
 It will not be a big deal if this spark before the Lok Sabha elections creates a new equation in the state

 Three matches were drawn
 srilanka ne bharat ko donon tiimon ke bich yahaan july 2008 ko hue pichley match main pari or 239 ran se dho daalaa tha
 This field is very pleasing to the Sri Lankan batsmen, but it will be a relief for India to not play the legendary spinner Muttiah Muralitharan who retired with the Gaul Test, who has proved to be an intriguing puzzle for the batsmen on this ground
 unhone is maidan par keval 24 maichon main 166 wicket chatkaaye hai jo kisi ek maidan par kisi gendbaaj kaa sarvaadhik wicket hasil karne kaa ricard he
 After the injury of experienced bowlers such as Zaheer Khan and s Sreesanth, India will be expected to perform better than their batsmen due to weak bowling, who did not meet expectations in Galle

 Has scored 495 runs with an average of 50, while Dravid has 30 in the same number of matches

 Laxman, the only batsman to score a half-century in India's last match at this ground, played a brilliant knock of 69 in the second innings at Galle and would like to improve his performance in the SSC while Yuvraj and Dhoni are better off this time against the Sri Lankan bowlers
 The preparation is expected to kick off with

 The ruling SAD-BJP coalition in Punjab, which is preparing for elections, is facing an anti-incumbency trend against its government for two consecutive terms, and is expected to re-emerge under the leadership of charismatic leader Captain Amarinder Singh — both She believes that there is a lot in this former opener that he needs to fear
 siddhu ne badhaai bijepi, akali dal or congress kii ghabrahangarsiddhipane us lokapriy aakarshan ko thodaa bhi kaayam rakh pate hai, jise unhone amritsar kaa saansad rahete hue pesh kiya tha, to 18 july ko bijepi ke manonith sadsy ke taur par rajyasabha se istipha dene ke naatakeey faisle ke baad aam aadmi party (aap) main unka janaa punjab ke chunaavon kii dasha-disha badal saktaa he
 This will not only increase the difficulties of the SAD-BJP or the Congress, but will also revive Arvind Kejriwal's ambition to stick to the 'national' plank
 purv patrkaar or ab rajya main aap kii kor team main shaamil chander sutaa dogra kahati hai, ''is khabar bhar se ki siddhu hamaari party main aa rahe hai, puure punjab main party kaaryakartaaon main utsaah kii lahar daud gai
 "sidhu has been vigilant about his next milestone in politics, but AAP leaders are not showing any such hesitation or hesitation
" dilli main aap ke bade ohadedaar sanjay singh un sabase pehle logon main se the jinhone kaha tha ki siddhu punjab memparty kii jangkaa hissaa honge
 Soon Manpreet Randhawa (one of a dozen journalists from Punjab who quit his job and joined AAP) testified this
 unhone kaha, ''unka aupchaarik taur par party main shaamil hona bas kuch vakt kii baat he
 Sidhu is waiting for the right time, Amritsar, which was chosen as his political homeland by Sidhu coming from Patiala in 2004 and before being forced to vacate the seat in 2014 under the title of Arun Jaitley, which he represented in the Lok Sabha for 11 years
 There was happiness and hope
 amritsar main lambey vakt se unke ek samarthak kehete hai, ''sheri (siddhu kaa upnaam) sahi vakt kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 They do not want to imply that they are desperate
 '' siddhu ke is samarthak ko ratti bhar shaq nahin he ki purv cricket khilaadi aap main shaamil honge or punjab main party kii ore se siem pad kaa cheharaa bhi honge
 Sidhu's supporters also point to 'clear' signs
 ve bataate hai ki 25 july kii press conference main siddhu basanti pagadi pahanakar aae the jo aap kii pahchaan he, jo unke iraadon kaa pataa detii he
 It also could not hide from anyone's eye that on the first day of the current monsoon session, on July 18, when he went to Parliament to submit his resignation, he still wore the same turban
 zyaadaatar siyaasi vishleshak mutmain hai ki aap hi unke liye sabase zyada mufeed vikalp he
 Even his wife Navjot Kaur confesses this openly
 lekin iske baad bhi yah abhi aakhri faisla nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 Take the reaction of Kejriwal himself on July 19, after Sidhu resigned from the Rajya Sabha
 
 
 main unki dilari kii daad detaa hum
 He is a good man
 meri raay he ki sabhi achche logon ko bijepi se istipha de dena chahie
 At the moment there is nothing more than this
 ve abhi hamaare saath nahin aae hai
 If someone wants to join you, then they have to become a common man first
 abhi kuch kahana jaldbaaji hogi
 Nothing has been decided
 ''siddhu se AAP ko milegaa kitna phayda?kejariwal ne apni baat bahut saavdhaanee se naap-taulakar kahi thi
 The intention behind this was apparently that if there was any doubt about this far-reaching move in the minds of the Punjab party leadership, it would go away
 jahaan party ko is purv cricketer ke aane kaa phayda milanaa tay he, vahiin chaaron taraf utsaah ke saath-saath purajor khandan bhi kiya ja rahaa he ki unka aana is baat par munhasar nahin he ki siddhu ko aap ke mukhyamantri ke chehre ke taur par pesh kiya hi jaae
 This is being said by more than one big party officer in the state
 unamem se harek kii shaayad apni mahatvakankshaayen hai
 aap's Punjab convenor and former Akali minister Sucha Singh Chhotepur, the party's most visible Punjabi face, Sangrur Lok Sabha member Balwant Singh Mann and the party's manifesto committee head former journalist Kanwar Sandhu, all dismissed these rumors
 Given that Sidhu will be the party's chief ministerial candidate
 jahaan sandhu ne yah chetavanee di ki agar aisa hua to iskaa aap kaaryakartaaon ke 'manobal par pratikul' asar padegaa, vahiin chhotepur yah kehete hue ruuth gaye, ''agar siddhu party main aate hai to ve chunaav nahin ladenge
 "the aap's CM candidate Dogpara spokeswoman Dogra insists," There is no question of presenting the Chief Ministerial candidate
 philhal hamaara puraa dhyaan chunaav abhiyaan par, logon ke liye acha or mufeed agenda taiyaar karne par he
 "many big leaders of the AAP point out that the party has managed to build an army and base of dedicated workers without any face, and therefore there should be no pressure to present anyone
" haalanki party ke pravaktaa ne mana ki aap kii 'soch' se puri tarah mail khaane vaale siddhu 'badal parivaar ke khilaaf mukammal hathiyaar honge
 Not only will he give jat-sikh face to the party which he desperately needs, he will also be able to spread aap's appeal to the wider Punjabi voters
 lekin ek duusari raay bhi he
 Pramod Kumar, director of the Institute of Development and Communication, Chandigarh, says, "you will not benefit from Sidhu, as it is being tossed
" '' unhone teen dashakon se punjab kii siyasat ko kareeb se dekha he
 "whatever appeal he has is as a comedian and TV host," he says
 '' or yah bhi ki amritsar (jahaan congress ke 'badnaam' ho chuke chehron ko hi unhone lalakaara tha) ke baahar unki parakh abhi honi he
 Pramod also questions Sidhu's lack of commitment to political ideology
 ve kehete hai, ''mukhyadhara ke siyasatdanon ko gaaliyaan dena or bhrashtachar or nashe kii buraai ke khilaaf naare lagaana bahut acchhee baat he
 But they do not see evidence of any such plan how they will deal with them
 '' aane vaale maheenon main chaahe jo ho, siddhu ne aap ke bheetar or baahar, donon jagah pakke taur par koharaam to machaa hi diya he
 Sources reveal that Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh is also trying to woo Sidhu
 amarinder ne 26 july ko india today se kaha, ''vah (siddhu) acha ladkaa he
 "he has actually laid a red carpet for Sidhu," he said, "we have a very old relationship
" unki maa nirmal bhagwat cor ne do baar congress ke tikat par chunaav ladaa tha, jabaki unke pita harbhagwan siddhu ne 1980 main congress sarkaar ke saath bataur edwocket-general kaam kiya tha

 Pataudi is considered the visionary captain of Indian cricket

 pataudi maanate the ki bhartiya spinner kisi bhi team ko dharashayi kar sakate hai or yahi kaaran he ki unhone ek match main ek se adhik spinner ko khilaane kii niti ko badhaava diya
 As a batsman, Pataudi did not achieve a great feat, but given his level of inspiring work as a captain, his figures look even more impressive
 pataudi ne 46 test maichon main 34
 He scored 2793 runs at an average of 91, including six centuries
 203 ran, jo 1964 main dilli main england ke khilaaf banaae the, unka shreshth score bana rahaa
 Studied in a prestigious educational institution like Oxford, Pataudi had all the qualities of a noble clan
 vah 1971 tak haryana ke kareeb sthit pataudi ke nawab the
 Pataudi was respected as a king until the Government of India dissolved the power of the royalty in 1971 by amending the constitution, but Pataudi ruled the Indian public through cricket

 Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has accepted the presence of terrorist organizations in his country
 lekin apane isi daawey ke saath unhone ek vivaadit bayaan bhi diya
 Regarding the Pulwama terror attack, Imran Khan said that this was a case that was carried out by the local terrorists
 unhone daawa kiya ki jaish-e-mohammad naa sirf pakistan main maujuud he, balki kashmir main bhi he or vahaan se kaam karata he
 It is clear from Imran Khan's statement that he is accepting that the jaish-e-mohammed was behind the Pulwama terror attack, whose mentor is Maulana Masood Azhar
 haalanki, isse pehle antarrashtriya manchon par pakistan khud kii jameen par jaish-e-mohammad kii maujuudagi ko nakaarta rahaa he
 At the same time, on the recommendation of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), China had opposed the declaration of Masood Azhar as a global terrorist
 bataa den ki isi saal 14 farvari ko jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main aatanki hamalaa hua tha
 In which 40 CRPF personnel were martyred, the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed was behind this attack
 ise padhein
 
 
 Imran Khan accepted the reality of 'terrorism', said - jaish-e-mohammed was responsible for the 40 terrorist groups who were active in PAK, Pakistan was handed over to Pakistan by Pakistan
 itnaa hi nahin jin aatanki addon se is hamale kii sajeesh rachi gai thi, vahaan balakot main bhartiya vayusena ne airstrike kii thi or un thikaanon ko nasht kar diya tha
 Not only did he comment on Pulwama but also the 9 / 11 terror attack in New York, he said that that attack has nothing to do with Pakistan
 imran khan ne ye daawa ek intervyuu main kiya he
 Imran Khan, who was on a visit to the US, met President Donald Trump there and raised the issue of Kashmir
 tabhi se vah nishane par hai
 In this interview, he confessed to working for 40 terrorist organizations in Pakistan
 imran ne daawa kiya ki pakistan kii pichhali sarkaron ne america ko aatanki sanghathanon ke bare main sach nahin bataaya
 Talking about the Kashmir issue, Imran Khan said that when Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pervez Musharraf were in power, he was very close to resolving the issue
 lekin durbhagyavash ye puraa nahin ho paaya tha
 Let me tell you that when Imran raised the issue of Kashmir in front of Donald Trump, Trump took the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on this subject, which caused a ruckus
 donald trump ne daawa kiya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne unase kashmir masale par madhyasthata karaane kii baat kahi thi, haalanki bharat kii taraf se trump ke is daawey ko jhootha qaraar diya ja chukaa he

 jabaki pradhanmantri jan aushadhi yojana dilli kii 15 fisadi aabaadi yani 30 lakh logo ko cover karti he
 Chief Minister AAP said that only those people who earn less than Rs
 10,000 are buried in it even when it is less than the minimum wage
 main aapako bataa duun ki yah criteria 2011 main jutaaye gaye data ke aadhaar par he jisamen yah paaya gaya tha ki rupe 1 xxrep 4 0 prati maah se kam kamaane vaale logo ko isaki sabase zyada jarurat he
 Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan further wrote that the proposed scheme of the state government, which according to me is still on paper, did not pay any special attention to the poor and rich families are able to get more benefits of free healthcare
 kejariwal ji aapkaa kaarykaal khatm hone vaala he isliye aap vidhansabha chunaav ko dekhte hue janata ko murkh banane ke liye ajeeb si yojana kii bauchhaar kar rahe hai jo kabhi lagu nahin ho sakati
 i invite you to come and be a part of this historic plan for the good of the people of Delhi and for the country
 gauratlab he ki kuch din pehle hi dilli ke mukhyamantriaravind kejarivalane centre kii ayushmaan yojana par sawaal uthaae the or ise dilli main lagu karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 He wrote a letter to the country's Health Minister Harsh Vardhan
 chitthee ke jariservind kejarivalane is yojana par sawaal uthaate hue poocha thaki jab haryana-uttar pradesh main lagu he ayushmaan yojana phir dilli ke aspataalon main kyon ilaaj karaane aate hai
 Apart from this, the Chief Minister of Delhi had also claimed that while the government spends 5 lakhs in the central scheme, on the other hand, the government spends up to 30 lakhs in the Delhi government's scheme
 arvind kejariwal ne apane letters main likhaa ki dilli or centre sarkaar donon kii yojanaon kaa makasad he ki logon ko swasthy sambandhi suvidhaayen milen
 He wrote that no one would be benefited by discontinuing the health plan already running in Delhi and implementing the second plan
 agar dilli swasthya yojana ko band kar ayushmaan bharat ko lagu kiya gaya to lakhon dillivaasiyon kaa nuksaan ho jayega
 Arvind Kejriwal had told the Union Health Minister through letter that, 'if in your (harsh Vardhan's) eyes, there is something in Ayushman India which is not in Delhi's health plan, please tell
 ham un sabhi acchhee baton ko dilli kii yojana main shaamil kar lenge
 ' ek purv kendriya mantri ne police main dhamkee bhare phone kol aane kii shikaayat darj karai he
 a senior police officer said that Arif Mohammad Khan lodged a complaint at the Hauz Khas police station in the morning saying that he received several threatening calls last night
 unhone bataaya, ‘khan ne hamen bataaya ki unhen ek hi number se dhamkee bhare kai phone aae
 The caller abused them and threatened them
 unhone bataaya ki phone karne vaale ne khan se kaha ki vah subah kaa suraj nahin dekh paaenge
 However, after his complaint, the police called this number, but it was closed

 raajnneeti main chizein jitani badalati he utani hi apane mul swaroop main bhi rah jaati hai
 No one knows this better than Bihar Chief Minister and Janata Dal United President Nitish Kumar, who has been in the news for the past 5 days for his stake in the central government
 haalanki vah har din ek baat kii duhai dete hai kii NDA main he or agar centre ke sarkaar main hissedari ko lekar unki baat nahin bani to iskaa matlab bihar main BJP ke saath sarkaar par koi pratikul asar nahin padegaa or saath hi vah kendra or bihar main endie main hi rahenge
 But for what will be the solution to the current controversy and crisis, Nitish Kumar's politics has to be seen 25 years in advance
 us samay kya hua tha yah bihar bijepi ke kai varisht netaaon jaise susheel modi or nand kishor yadav ko acchhee tarah se yaad hoga
 It was a matter of stake in power that when Nitish Kumar broke away from Lalu Yadav and formed Lok Samata Party
 yah sabko pataa he ki lalu yadav ko netaa vipaksh banane kaa masalaa ho yaa bihar ke mukhyamantri banane main nitish kumaar ne usamen ek ahm bhoomika adaa kii thi
 Perhaps it was because of this that initially, at the party level for a couple of years, he used to give importance to Lalu Yadav's words in the decisions of the government
 sarkaar main nitish kii hi chalati thi
 But after the arrest of Advani, when Lalu Yadav came to know that his own popularity is increasing the base of the party and no one can challenge him in power
 tab lalu yadav nitish kumaar kii baton ko nazarandaaz karnaa shuru kar diya or naubat to yahan tak aa gayi ki unke grih zile main adhikariyon ke niyukti main bhi lalu yadav apni manmarzi karnaa karne lage
 The effect of this was that Nitish Kumar also felt that Lalu now wants to run the power at his own will and does not want to share at all
 yahi ek kaaran tha jo baad main anya muddon ke alaava sabase prabhavi kaaran samta party kii sthapana kaa bana
 But perhaps 25 years, Nitish Kumar would not even have the idea that a similar situation would come once again
 jab centre sarkaar main apane party ke mantri banavaane ke liye unhen unke formule ko nazarandaaz kar diya jayega
 Because this time BJP has got a strong majority in the center and gave a new formula for symbolic representation in the Union Cabinet
 jiske tahat har sahyogi ke ek-ek saansad ko mantrimandal main jagah di gai
 This thing was different, some were being given cabinet and some were given the status of Minister of State
 nitish ke paas do vikalp the ek chupchaap apane sansadeey dal main se kisi ek sadsy ko shapath lene ke liye namit karte yaa phir apni asahmati ko saarvajanik karte hue us samay tak kaa intazaar karnaa jab tak unki ichha ke anusaar ek or sadasyon ko mantrimandal main jagah nahin mil jaati
 Nitish chose the second option and there were solid reasons behind it
 bihar main jo endie ko 39 siten mili hai us jeet ke liye unhone qareeb 171 chunavi sabhaayen kii jinamein aadhe se adhik apane sahyogi dalon jisamen BJP ke sabhi 17 ummidavaaron or lok janashakti party ke sabhi chah ummidavaar ke kshetra main 1 se adhik kai sabhaayen kin
 Apart from this, Nitish Kumar, while maintaining the coalition religion, also did not issue the manifesto of his party on this basis only because the media would have questioned his party's stand on controversial issues like Section 370, Citizenship Bill apart from BJP
 isi prishthbhumi main nitish ko shaayad is baat kaa andaaza nahin rahaa hoga ki anupaatik pratinidhitiv ke unke formula par koi vichaar bhi nahin karegaa
 However, after forming a coalition government with the BJP, this is not the first time that the central leadership of BJP has made Nitish realize that his every demand and demand will not be accepted
 isse pehle bhi saarvajanik rup se patna vishvavidhyalay ko kendriya vishvavidhyalay kaa darja dene kii maang ko bhi usee manch se pradhan mantri modi ne kaarij kar diya
 Apart from this, Narendra Modi himself promised a special state status at a meeting in Purnia, Bihar and put it on the back burner
 khud up mukhyamantri susheel modi kitni baar saarvajanik manch se kah chuke hai ki ye maang maananaa ab sambhav nahin
 Nitish Kumar banned liquor in Bihar, but despite the demand of two neighboring bjp-ruled states of Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, there was no prohibition
 jiske kaaran ye donon rajya bihar main avaidh sharaab ke mukhya shrot hai
 At present, the government in Bihar is in no danger despite not getting the stake
 kyonki jis aasaani or samuchit tareeqe se bihar bijepi ke logon ke saath nitish kumaar kaa sarkaar chalaane kaa anubhav hai wo rashtriya janata dal ke saath uske vipareet katu anubhav rahaa tha
 Because there was a lot of parallel intervention of Lalu Yadav and secondly, when the list of officials who sent Lalu Yadav in the name of stake were mostly people of tainted or controversial image, they were in the present situation where Nitish Kumar's relationship with Bihar BJP colleagues Sahas will be normal with his cabinet colleagues, while the state of mistrust towards the central leadership of the BJP Mr
 bearing her that soon if not resolved in the future will also look at state functions
 filhal patna main patrakaron kaa kaam is baat ko lekar bad gaya he ki ab har chiz main chaukasee baratani pad rahi he
 The two sides together chant the 'we are all together' together
 lekin nitish kumaar kaa apana raajnneetik itihaas rahaa he ki hissedari ke naam par upeksha hone par unhone na keval nai raah pakadi he balki nae saathi bhi chune hai
 And this is a fact which is known by the leaders of Bihar BJP and if the central leadership ignores this, then everyone may have to bear the brunt of it
 purv sainik ramkishan greval kii aatmahatya ke baad oropi kii maujuuda vyavastha par phir rashtriya bahes chhid gayi he
 In the midst of politics going on this issue, there are still one and a half lakh ex-servicemen, who have not been able to benefit from the new OROP
 ritred hawaldaar ashok chavaan 2004 main sena se ritair hue
 With the implementation of the new OROP system, there was hope that the benefits of better pension would be available, but the disappointment is that despite the announcement, the first installment of increased pension has not been received
 kai baar pradhanmantri or raksha mantri ko chitthee likh chuke hai lekin koi phayda nahin hua
 The comments ashok chavaan kehete hai, 'mujhe koi arier kii kist nahin mili ajtak

 Retired Havildar Ashok Chavan, along with hundreds of ex-servicemen, have been fighting for years in the fight for better OROP
 raksha mantralay ke mutabik 15 sitambar tak 20,63,763 pensiondhari hai

 lekin 14 maheene baad 1
 5 lakh ex-servicemen have been struggling for better pension
 is vivaad par pehali pratikriya main raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne mana ki deree hui he
 But everything will be resolved in two months

 Everything will be alright in one or two months, the remaining issues will also be resolved
 ' ab dekhnaa hoga ki raksha mantri apane aashwaasan par is baar kitna khara utarate hai
 Retired Havildar Ashok Chavan retired from the army in 2004
 nai oropi vyavastha lagu hone se ummid bandhi thi ki behatar pension kaa phayda milegaa, lekin maayoos hai ki elaan ke baavjood badi pension kii pehali kisht bhi nahin mil pai he
 Many times have written letters to the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense but to no avail
 tippaniyan Ashok Chavan says, 'I have not received any arrear installment till date
 maine pradhanmantri or raksha mantri ko chitthee likhi lekin kuch nahin hua
 The government is not serious
 ' behatar oropi kii ladaai main ritred hawaldaar ashok chavaan ko saikadon purv sainikon kaa saath mil rahaa he jo barason se lard rahe hai

 In the first reaction to the controversy, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar admitted that there was a delay
 lekin do maheene main sabakuch sulajhaa liya jayega
 In Budgam, Manohar Parrikar said, 'there are some technical flaws

 prastaavit samaajawaadee dharmanirpeksh morcha kaa netritv mulaayam singh yadav dwaara karne kaa elaan karne vaale unke bhai sapa netaa shivpal singh yadav ne ravivaar ko kaha ki jahaan mulaayam khadey ho jate hai, vahiin se samaajawaadee party kii shuruuaat hoti he
 Shivpal's remark is similar to the dialogue of Amitabh Bachchan's famous film 'kalia', Amitabh said in the film, "where we stand, the line starts from there
 " isi tarj par shivpal ne twit kar kaha, "jahaan netaji (mulaayam) khadey ho jate hai, vahiin se samaajawaadee party kii shuruuaat hoti he
 " morcha banane ke shivpal ke prayaas ko mulaayam parivaar main shivpal ke netritv vaale gut ko party main pun:sthapit karne kii koshish mana ja rahaa he
 He wants Mulayam to be the head of the party again
 philhal sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav hai, jinhone pita se party kii kaman chin lee thi
 Ever since the sp's poor performance in the assembly elections, Shivpal has been demanding that Akhilesh step down and give the reins of the party to Mulayam
 mulaayam ne hi 1992 main sapa kaa gathan kiya tha
 Shivpal said, "he (mulayam) lives for secularism and has put many governments at stake so we stand with Netaji and will stand
" " mulaayam ne bhi mainpuri main kaha ki sapa ko majboot karne ke prayaas hone chahie
 Mulayam blamed the alliance with the Congress for the sp's poor performance in Uttar Pradesh assembly elections
 tippaniyan Mulayam alleged that the Congress had left no stone unturned to ruin his life and that his son Akhilesh allied with the Congress
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, "congress ke saath gathbandhan hi party kii maujuuda kharaab sthiti ke liye jimmedaar he
 i had advised Akhilesh not to do this but he did
 sapa apni haar ke liye khud jimmedaar he naa ki pradesh kii janata
 "mulayam has earlier also blamed Akhilesh for the defeat
 unhone kaha tha ki unke bete ne unka apmaan kiya
 At the same time, he said that the voters felt that one who does not belong to his father cannot be someone else's confidant
 udhar, jaswant nagar vidhansabha seat par chunaav jite shivpal ne dhamkee di he ki yadi akhilesh ne mulaayam ko party kii kaman nahin saunpi to vah dharm nirpeksh morche kaa gathan karenge
 On Shivpal's statement of Ram Gopal Yadav as 'shakuni', Mulayam said that what Shivpal said was correct
 shivpal ko haraane ke prayaas kiye gayi
 Money was also spent for this
 ramgopal bhi kah chuke hai ki shivpal ko akhilesh kaa istipha maangane se pehle party kaa samvidhan padhnaa chahie
 Akhilesh will not resign under any circumstances and there is no question of handing over the command of SP to Mulayam

 vidhansabha chunaav main sapa ke kharaab pradarshan ke baad se hi shivpal maang kar rahe hai ki akhilesh pad se haten or party kii bagdor mulaayam ke haath main den
 Mulayam formed the SP in 1992
 shivpal ne kaha, "unhone (mulaayam) dharm nirpekshata ke liye jindagi or kai sarkarein daanv par laga deen isliye ham netaji ke saath khadey hai or khadey rahenge
 "mulayam also said in Mainpuri that efforts should be made to strengthen the SP
 sapa ke uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main kharaab pradarshan ke liye mulaayam ne congress ke saath gathbandhan ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 The comments mulaayam ne aarope lagaaya ki congress ne unke jivan ko barbaad karne main koi kasar baaki nahin rakhi thi or unke bete akhilesh ne congress se hi gathjod kar liya
 He told reporters, "the alliance with Congress is responsible for the party's current deterioration
 maine akhilesh ko salaah di thi ki vah aisa naa kare lekin usne kiya
 The SP is responsible for its defeat and not the people of the state
 " mulaayam pehle bhi haar ke liye akhilesh ko jimmedaar tehra chuke hai
 He had said that his son insulted him
 saath hi bole ki matadaataaon ne mahasoos kiya ki jo apane pita kaa nahin he vah kisi or kaa vishwaasapaatr nahin ho saktaa
 On the other hand, Shivpal, who won the election on Jaswant Nagar assembly seat, has threatened that if Akhilesh does not hand over the command of the party to Mulayam, he will form a secular front
 ramgopal yadav ko ‘shakuni’ bataane ke shivpal ke bayaan par mulaayam ne kaha ki shivpal ne jo kaha sahi he
 Efforts were made to defeat Shivpal
 iske liye dhan bhi kharch kiya gaya
 Ramgopal has also said that Shivpal should read the party's constitution before seeking Akhilesh's resignation
 akhilesh kisi bhi sthiti main istipha nahin denge or sapa kii kaman mulaayam ko saunpane kaa koi prashn nahin he
 Mulayam alleged that the Congress had left no stone unturned to ruin his life and that his son Akhilesh allied with the Congress

 sarkari jameen par kabja kar avaidh dhang se rah rahe logon ko jharkhand sarkaar ne niyamit karne kaa faisla liya he
 Under this, government land and up to five acres of arable land will be provided to such people for about 12 decimals
 iske liye sarkaar pehle hi shahari or gramin kshetron main surveykshan kara chuki he
 In this survey conducted in more than 30 thousand villages, it was found that about two lakh families are living their lives illegally by occupying about six and a half lakh acres of land
 bhoomihin graminon ko bhi milegaa iskaa labhsarkaar ke faisle ke mutabik iske tahat vaise gramin parivaar bhi laae jaaenge jinke paas philhal apni koi jameen nahin he
 However, this decision of the government is not new
 pehle bhi avibhajit bihar ke samaysarkari jaminki bandobasti kar unhen avaidh kabjadhariyon ko diya gaya tha, lekin is baar is soochi main anusuchit janajati, anoosachit jati, anya pichhadaa varg ke saath-saath saamaanya varg or divyangon ko bhi joda gaya he
 Apart from this, paramilitary forces, martyred soldiers of state police and registered refugees have also been included, who will be provided with land settlement
 is faisle main kaha gaya he kishrnarthiyonko shahari jabaki anya ko gramin kshetra main jameen uplabdh karai jaaegi
 The creamy layer is excluded from this list
 People who are income tax payers or are in government service or have retired from government service will not get the benefit
 vahin is yojana main vaise logon ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya he jo saal 1985 ke baad se avaidh kabjadhari hai
 It also does not include people who are occupying public lands
 faisle main kaha gaya he ki waisi jameen jisamen saarvajanik sadak, masanaa, nadi, pahaad maujuud hai unki bandobasti nahin kii jaaegi
 Also, illegal occupation of up to 150 meters in the vicinity of police station, school, hospital and Rajpath will not be regularized

 sopan joshiham 1
 3 billion Gandhi is a country of experts
 har bhartiya or uske whatsap group ke har sadsy ke paas mohandas karamchand gandhi ke bare main ekaadh raay he
 And why not? After all, we see Gandhi growing up again and again on various currency notes, in the name of streets, in statues, photographs
 kaaryakramon ke liye vishay talashte aayojakon kaa kaam 'mahatma gandhi kii praasangikta' se chalata hi rahata he
 a mountain of unproven things stands about them; Many people often quote Gandhi's statements in a false way in order to present their ideas effectively
 aise mugalate hona aasaan he
 Gandhi's monumental narrative of public life is authentically compiled and printed in a hundred volumes 'sampoorna Gandhi Varamay'
 dashakon se unka naam academik shodh-patron ke sheershakon kii khanaapurti kuch is tarah karata aa rahaa he, 'gandhi or
 
 
 '(fill in the blank with the subject of your choice)
 'gandhi or marxvad', 'gandhi or jati', 'gandhi or amuk' sheershak lekh paa-paa ke mere ek purv sampadak is kadar khiz gaye the ki unhone 'gandhi or aalu' sheershak se hi ek lekh chhap diya
 Gandhi's life is an open book, anyone picks up one incident or something written in his life according to his needs
 phir bhi gandhi jivan ke bare main agyaan bhi pahaad jaisaa he
 Subhash Chandra Bose first called him 'father of the Nation' in 1944
 tab se yah tamgaa unke saath chipak gaya he
 Just as after his assassination, there was a flood of reverence towards him, now there is growing disinformation towards him, or at least Hindutva elements are engaged in this effort
 yah pitru-hatya kii teevr ichha kii tarah he
 Insulting his memory is a source of empowerment among many people nowadays
 ve poochhate hai, aakhir hamaare desh kii samasyaon ke liye rashtrapita nahin to or koun doshi he? unhone bhagat singh ko kyon nahin bachaaya? kyon unhone vallabhbhai patel kii jagah jawaharlal nehru ko chunaa? kyon unhone bantwaaraa hone diya? kyon unhone pakistan ko utana sara paisa dilava diya? unhone jati / varnashram kaa samarthan kyon kiya
 
 
 
 aise sabhi sawaalon kaa vidwaan puure shodh ke saath uttar de chuke hai
 But it takes a lot of time and effort to disprove an allegation based on propaganda
 iske alaava soshal media ke hamaare daur main sach or jhooth kaa bhed mitata ja rahaa he
 Just dramatically dropping the charge makes it work
 ek baar jab gandhi se poocha gaya ki tamaam niraashaa ke bich bhi ve ashavan kaise rahete hai, to unka jawaab tha ki saadhaaran bhartiya logon main ahimsa ke prati aasthaa he
 When asked who did they expect, their answer was, there is a lack of compassion among educated people
 ye tippaniyan aaj bhavishyavaanee kii tarah lagati hai
 Compassion was a good word when i was growing up in the 1970s and '80s
 meraa bachapan dilli ke gandhivadi sansthaanon ke bich gujara he
 Many old people lived around us, who were Gandhi's allies during his youth
 ve sabhi vinamr, saral or milansaar log the jo ham bacchon ko laad-pyaar dete the
 We were not even aware of his sacrifice in the freedom movement
 unki mrityu ke baad kisi shradhanjali sabha yaa kisi smriti lekh main hi hamen unke balidanon ke bare main pataa chalata tha
 We used to see Gandhi in him only
 mahatma gandhi ke likhe ko padhgaye kii jarurat hi nahin thi
 It was needed in 2017
 bihar sarkaar praathmik or madhyamik ke bacchon ke liye mahatma gandhi par do alag-alag pustaken taiyaar karnaa chaahati thi
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had a personal interest in the project
 rajya sarkaar champaran satyagrah kii shatabdi ke aayojan main juty thi
 Education surveys were telling that the ability of students to read and understand what was written was very poor
 sarkaar in pustakon ke madhyam se gandhi vichaar kaa sanchaar hi nahin, sakshartaa ko badhaava bhi dena chaahati thi
 When his advisors contacted me, i told him that i had not read Mahatma Gandhi in the original
 lekin unka kahana tha ki ve ek nai style chaahate hai, kyonki vidwaan log duusare vidwaanon ke liye hi likhte-padhate hai, bacchon ke liye nahin
 He was surprised to see unending propaganda about Mahatma Gandhi and hatred on the Internet
 ve tathyon par aadhaarit aisi do kitaaben chaahate the jo padhai main kamjor chaatr bhi pard saken
 Now Gandhi became a subject for me
 janamanas main prachlit dharanaen mahaj tathyon or gyaan ke aadhaar par nahin banati hai, lekin sarkari pariyojna main sab kuch aitihaasik rup se sahi hona jaruri tha
 In addition, Gandhi himself considered the purity of the instrument as well as the purity of the instrument mandatory
 maine gandhi ko un logon ke aacharan main dekha-siikhaa tha, jinhone unheen ke bataae mulyon ke sahare apana jivan jiyaa tha
 When we children could not imagine Gandhi, then these old people would tell us about Gandhi
 gandhi kaa sabhi ke liye pyaar or karunaa ham unke aacharan main mahasoos kar pate the
 It seemed that a person and life like Gandhi is possible
 aaj gandhi ko samajhane kii kalpanashiltaa kho gai he
 Albert Einstein warned about this
 unhone likhaa tha ki aane vaali peedhishaan shaayad hi yakeen kar paaen ki gandhi jaisaa haad-maance kaa koi vyakti is dharti par tha
 Now such generations have come
 jin logon kaa jivan gandhi ke saath se badla tha, ve sabhi vidaa ho gaye hai
 The new people do not have references to Gandhi
 sahi he ki gandhi par saikadon kitaaben or aseemit shodh samagriyaan hai
 But most of the research is either for academic needs or for entertainment
 khuli jigyaasa se shodh kam hi hota he
 Gandhi's settlement originality is unimaginable
 unke kareebi sahyogiyon ne likhaa he ki gandhi or unke tareekon ko samajhane main unhen bhi bahut vakt laga tha
 In 1934, he wanted to establish a non-violent leather industry
 ve pashu raksha ke liye mare hue jaanwaron kii khaal kaa upyog anivaary maanate the, par yah kaam unhone parampara se chamade kaa kaam karne ko majaboor jati ke logon ko nahin saunpa, balki ek chittapavan brahman ko diya jinka naam tha gopal rajaraam valunjakar
 There are many such examples
 dakshin africa main un par buree tarah hamalaa karne vaale mir alam baad main unke rakshak ban gaye
 When the government machinery failed to stop the riots in Kolkata in 1947, Gandhi's fast had done what is often called the 'miracle of Calcutta'
 1938 main congress ke haripura sammelan main jo poster bane the, ve unhone prasiddh chitrakaar nandlaal basu se banaavaaye the
 Gandhi was a bashful creature with no natural talent
 na ve bhaashan-kala main maahir the, na unka vyaktitv bahut aakarshak or prabhaavshaalee tha
 But the surprise is that even then, a variety of artists, musicians and creative people were always ready to support Gandhi
 aise atapate jivan ke bare main bacchon ko kaise bataaya ja saktaa he? ek to yahi ki likhaai saral or svachh honi chahie, jo padhgaye vaale kii mushkil aasaan kare
 Gandhi's own prose is simple, untouched
 ve apane likhe main pathak ke liye shankaa rakhane kii gunjaaish chhodte the
 These things were also taken care of in these books
 pathakon kaa kahana he ki gandhi par is tarah padhgaye se achraj hota he
 His ingenuity enchants his honesty to put everything in front
 bacchon ne bataaya he ki unhone kabhi kalpana bhi nahin kii thi ki gandhi kabhi ek komal man ke kamjor bachche the
 The teachers with wet eyes have said that they were mistaking non-violence as cowardice, that they could not get a sense of his bravery
 do rajya in kitabon ko jelon main baant rahe hai
 i am curious to know how the convicts and criminals in prison look at such a famous prisoner
 padhgaye waalon ko sabase zyada aashcharya isse hota he ki gandhi kitni sachaai se apane dar ko sweekaar karte hai or us par vijay paane ke liye kitni kadi mehnat karte hai
 Nehru once said that Gandhi's greatest achievement is that he eradicated fear from the hearts of Indians
 maujuuda rajnatik maahaul main dar vyaapt he
 At such a time, the lesson of fearless compassion can certainly be useful for our children and their teachers
 sopan joshi gandhi par bacchon ke liye do kitabon ke lekhak hai: ek tha mohan or baapu kii paati

 Many colleges in Delhi University have decided to increase the fees annually by 5-10%
 halaki diu kii fees to sabhi collejon ke liye baraabar hoti he, lekin college apane anusaar fees tay karte hai
 Students believe that due to the large difference in college fees, they will have to think about choosing a college
 diu main yun to sabhi collejon ke liye fees ek baraabar hoti he, lekin college is baat ke liye swatantra hote hai ki apane sansadhano ke aadhaar par fees tay karen
 Now that the undergraduate course is also 4 years old, it is obvious that students will have to spend more money to graduate
 vaise fees hike kaa zyada asar dilli ke baahar se aae chaatro par hoga, kyonki unhen naa keval fees kaa kharch uthaanaa hoga, balki unhen ek atirikt saal ke liye loging-boarding kaa kharchaa bhi dena hoga

 Now he will remain in jail till 27 November
 patrkaar vinod verma ko aaj adaalat main pesh kiya gaya tha
 There was a lot of controversy about presenting them in court
 pehle kuch afasaron ne bataaya ki patrkaar vinod verma ko adaalat nahin laayaa jayega
 He will be produced through video conferencing
 lekin kuch der baad soochna ai kii unhen adaalat main pesh kiya jayega
 He was brought to the court premises with security arrangements from the prison vehicle
 court main is maamle kii sunwaayee hui
 The defense filed an application in the court for not providing basic facilities including health to journalist Vinod Verma
 bachaav paksh ne kaha ki patrkaar vinod verma kii davaaiyaan tak pahunchane main police roda ban rahi he
 They are not even being provided with basic facilities in the barracks
 isi dauraan police ne bhi adaalat main apana paksh rakhaa
 The prosecution has demanded the handwriting of journalist Vinod Verma
 bachaav paksh ne yah kahkar iskaa virodh kiya ki police sajeesh karke jhuthe tathy adaalat ke saamne rakhana chaahati he
 After hearing the arguments, the court extended the period of judicial custody till 27 November
 nyaayik hiraasat ke liye jail jate vakt adaalat parisar main maujuud patrakaron ko naseehat dete hue patrkaar vinod verma ne kaha ki aaj ke daur main sab se mushkil kaam patrakarita karnaa he

 Let us tell you that the Dirty CD scandal of a minister in Chhattisgarh has not ended yet that the news of the CD of three more ministers of Chief Minister Raman Singh's cabinet has come up in the political corridor
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki yah sidi bazaar main aa gai he or jald hi whatrup or duusare soshal cites main viral hone vaali he
 Although it is not officially clear whether the person in the CD is really a minister or someone else
 philhal police darty sidi ke is duusare episod par apni najar jamaai hui he
 The ruckus over the first CD has not stopped
 teen or mantriyon kii sidi aane kii khabar ne bijepi kii chintaa badha di he
 It is being told that these three cds are also dirty and the ministers whose names are being named, often from the ministry of the colorful mood of the three, from the bureaucrats' bungalows are often in the headlines
 in tinonsex sidiko lekar vasuuli kii bhi charchaa he
 It is being told that the people who have made this CD are in the custody of a huge amount of money
 asia kii do badi shaktiyon bharat or china ke bich pichley teen dinon main tanaav nai oonchai tak pahunch chukaa he
 There are constant threats from both countries
 tanaav kaa ye taaja daur dalai lamas ke arunachal pradesh daure ko lekar shuru hua he
 On China's objections to this visit, India clearly said that China should not interfere in our internal affairs, while China said that this move of India has caused great damage to bilateral relations and can increase the tension on the border
 yahaan tak ki dalai lamas ke maamle par china ne kashmir main dakhal dene kii bhi dhamkee de di
 The tension on the Dalai Lama's visit is just the latest issue, but in recent times, there are five big issues on which big powers like China and India are face to face and the tension can go to any extent
 1
 The border dispute between Arunachal and Leh has been a border dispute between India and China for nearly 6 decades, but it is perhaps the only tense border in the world where there is not a single shot after the 1962 war
 donon deshon ne seemaa vivaad ko sulajhane ke liye kai maikenism par vichaar kiya lekin abtak kuch thos saamne nahin aayaa he
 Last year, the soldiers of both the countries remained face-to-face for several days over areas in the border in leh-ladakh, while the Dalai Lama has come under direct threat on China during his visit to Arunachal
 haal main ye baat saamne ai thi ki china arunachal ke tamang ke badale aksaichin par apana daawa chhod saktaa he
 But will India leave Tawang? bharat isapar katai raji nahin he or aise main border maamle par sahmati kii koi gunjaaish nahin dikhti
 2
 NSG or UNSC main bharat kii sadsyta kaa muddaabaadi main duniya kii duusare sabase bade or duniya kii sabase tej ubharti arthvyavasthaaon main se ek bharat UNSC kii sthaayee sadsyta ke liye puraa jor lagaae hue he
 China is the biggest obstacle in this way
 thik aise hi enesji kii sadsyta kii bharat kii koshishon main china lagaataar baadha banataa ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, tensions between the two countries are also evident on the foreign policy front
 america kii asia niti main china ke khilaaf bharat ek majboot hissaa he to pakistan ke jariye samudri pahunch hasil karne kii china kii koshishon main bharat ek roda
 In such a situation, both countries are moving towards a new phase of tension
 3
 The issue of the pak-china Economic Corridor and Gilgit Baltistan is being outlawed by India as a clearly illegal china-pakistan economic corridor being built at a cost of $ 54 billion
 jabaki china ise kisi bhi keemat par puraa karne par ada hua he
 This corridor passes through gilgit-baltistan which India considers its share and has announced its release from the illegal occupation of Pakistan
 vahiin china kii shah par pakistan gilgit-balatistan ko apana paanchvaan rajya banane kii koshish main he
 This case can cause tension on the international stage anytime
 4
 The case of Azhar Masood and Hafiz Saeed, China has twice stopped India's efforts in the UN to ban Pakistani terrorists Azhar Masood and Hafiz Saeed, the masterminds of the Mumbai attacks
 china suraksha parishad kaa sthaayee sadsy he or uske paas vito power he
 India is demanding reforms in institutions like the Security Council only in view of such situations
 bharat kaa tark he ki pichley 6 dashakon main duniya main santulan kaaphi had tak badal chukaa he
 India is a major power today and should get permanent membership in the Security Council
 china isamen baadha banataa aayaa he
 Even in the Indian efforts to act on Pakistani terrorists, there have been obstacles
 5
 India has also raised its voice against the aggression of China in the South China Sea area
 is kshetra ke sahyogi deshon ke saath vyapaarik hiton kii suraksha ke liye bharat ne dakshin china sagar main china kii nitiyon kaa virodh kiya
 All the countries including US and Japan are in support of India in this matter
 beshak bharat dakshin china sagar main kisi prakaar kii sidhi daavedaari nahin rakhata to bhi iske 55 pratishat aarthik hit dakshin china sagar se jude hue hai
 India also believes that the countries of the region involved in the disputes should resolve their disputes without fear of any threat or use of force because if this happens then complications will arise even if they do not want to, which will bring peace to the region
 And will have a bad effect on stability
 china is kshetra se bharat ko dur rahane kii chetavanee dete rahaa he
 In such a situation, tensions in India and China can take serious form on these issues at any time
 neend kaa puraa hona har umr ke logon ke liye bahut jaruri he or khaskar ke chote bacchon or badhate bacchon ke liye
 It has been discovered in many researches and research that it is very important for children to get enough sleep for brain development
 kya aap jaanate hai ki kis ayuvarg ke bachche ke liye kitni neend lenaa jaruri he? bachche kii sahi neend kaa pataa hona mata-pita kii jaankaree ke liye bahut jaruri he
 Let us know how much sleep a child up to 10 years of age should take
 new bourn baby se 6 maheene tak ke bachche kii neendyah bachche ke jivan kaa sabase sukun bharaa samay hota he
 In this stage the child should sleep for 16 to 20 hours
 haalanki, neend kaa samay bachche kii aadat par nirbhar karata he ki vah kitna sota he
 a child of 6 to 12 months of sleep begins to develop the child's body at this age, he learns to walk and also learns to speak
 aise main uskaa sharir thak jaataa he or use kam se kam 12 se 15 ghante kii neend avashya leni chahie
 How much the child sleeps at the age of 1 to 3 years, at this age the child becomes very active
 isliye uskaa 13 ghante kii neend puri karnaa jaruri hota he
 a child from 3 to 5 years of age, at this age, the child becomes socially active
