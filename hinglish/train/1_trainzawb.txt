 bijepi pravaktaa lambey lambey bhaashanon main daawa kar rahe the ki jiesti kaise desh ke chote or informal sector main tex choron par nakel kas degaa
 Then, knowing that the coming GST is weak, the economists of the central government were wondering how GST could boost the GDP growth rate of small and medium businesses in the country (the sector which gives the highest jobs in the economy)
 Will give

 With this decision, almost 90% of the businesses under GST were exempted from the provision of monthly returns, now only 10% of businesses will have to file returns on monthly basis
 isamen koi hairaani nahin hogi ki aage chalakar bache in 10 fisadi bade kaarobaar ko bhi masik ritern daakhil karne se chhot de di jaae

 But torture and pain do not end here

 Stuart explains that he was forced to read the principles of fraternity by standing bare-bodied in a bucket full of snow
 is dauraan unhen sirf undervier pahananaa hota tha or froternity ke baaki sadsy un par pani kii baltiyaan udelte the
 He also told that in 2012, he was beaten with sticks for eight weeks
 yahi nahin unhen tab tak pani pine ke liye kaha jaataa tha jab tak ki ve behosh naa ho jaaen
 Not only this, they had to wear nappies and women's clothes

 Let me tell you that almost every state of America has branches of this fraternity

 bollywood ke 'sho main' kahe jane vaale divangat actor-diarector raaj kapoorka aaj janmdin he
 He was born on 14 December 1924 in Peshawar (pakistan)
 isamen shaq nahin ki raaj kapur ne jis parivaar main janm liya, uskaa bollywood main bada naam tha, lekin ek sach yah bhi he ki raaj kapur ne apane kariyar main jin oonchaaiyon ko chuaa, uske peeche sirf or sirf unki mehnat or kaabiliyat thi
 When Raj Kapoor settled in Mumbai with his father Prithviraj Kapoor, his father gave him the mantra that 'raju will start from the bottom and will go up'
 pita kii is baat ko ganth baandhakar rajkupar ne 17 saal kii umr main 'ranjit moviekom' or 'bombai tokies' film production company main spotbvoy kaa kaam shuru kiya
 Even after being born to a person like Prithvi Raj Kapoor, Raj Kapoor fought hard in Bollywood
 unke liye shuruyaat itani aasaan nahin rahi thi
 You will be surprised to know that Raj Kapoor's film career started with a chante
 1
 Acting as a 'clapper Boy' in a film by Kedar Sharma, one of the most famous directors of the time, Raja Kapoor once clapped so loudly that the protagonist's fake beard came out stuck in the clasp
 is par kedaar sharma ne gusse main aakar raaj kapur ko joardaar chaanta raseed kar diya tha
 Later, Kedar took Raj Kapoor as a hero in his film 'neelkamal'
 2
 Raj Kapoor inherited acting from his father Prithviraj, who was a famous theater actor and film actor of his time
 raaj kapur ne abhinay kaa safarprithviraj theatreke manch se hi shuru kiya tha
 In 1935, at the age of just 10, he made a small role in the film 'inquilab'
 uske 12 saal baad raaj kapur ne mashhoor adaakara madhubala ke saath film 'neelkamal' main lead role kiya
 3
 raaj kapur kaa puraa naam 'ranbir raaj kapur' tha
 Ranbir is now the name of his grandson ie rishi-neetu Kapoor's son
 4
 Born on 14 December 1924 in Peshawar, Raj Kapoor later his family settled in Punjab, did his schooling in Dehradun
 haalanki padhai main unka man kabhi nahin laga or 10veen class kii padhai puri hone se pehle hi unhone skool chhod diya tha
 5
 raaj kapur kii filmon ke kai geet behad lokapriy hue, jinamein 'meraa juuta he japani' (shri 420),'aawaara hum' (aawaara), 'e bhai jaraa dekh ke chalo' or 'jeena isi kaa naam he' (meraa naam joker) sabase zyada mashhoor hai
 Raj Kapoor's films include 'mera Naam Joker', 'shree 420', 'awara', 'bewafa', 'aashiana', 'ambar', 'anhoni', 'papi', 'ah', 'dhun', 'boot' Polishes' are prominent
 6
 An interesting thing about Raj Kapoor is that he loved the white sari
 jab chote the tab unhone safed sari main ek mahila ko dekha tha, jis par unka dil aa gaya tha
 After that incident, Raj Kapoor became so enamored with the white sari that he wore a white sari to the heroines working in his films - Nargis, Padmini, Vyjayanthimala, Zeenat Aman and Mandakini
 yahaan tak ki ghar main unki patni krishna bhi hameshaa safed sari hi pahana karti thim
 7
 raaj kapur ne 24 saal kii umr main apana production studio'aar ke films'shuru kiya or industry ke sabase yang diarector ban gaye
 In his production debut 'aag', Raj Kapoor acted alongside Madhubala, Kamini Kaushal and Prem Nath
 is film main unhone diarector or actor donon kii bhoomika nibhaai
 8
 bharat sarkaar ne raaj kapur ko manoranjan jagat main unke apurv yogadan ke liye 1971 main 'padmabhushan' se sammanit kiya tha
 In 1987, he was also awarded the 'dadasaheb Phalke Award', the highest honor of cinema
 1960 main film 'anaadi' or 1962 main 'jis desh main ganga bahati he' ke liye best actor kaa filmphere puraskaar bhi raaj kapur ne jeeta
 Apart from this, he also received the Filmfare Award for Best Director for 'sangam' in 1965, 'mera Naam Joker' in 1970 and 'prem Rog' in 1983
 9
 'showman' Raj Kapoor had a heart attack at an award ceremony, after which he kept swinging between life and death in the hospital for a month
 aakhirkaar 2 june 1988 ko unhone duniya ko alavida kah diya
 10
 kapur parivaar aisa parivaar he, jisamen'dada sahib phalke'puraskaar teen baar aayaa
 In 1972, Raj's father Prithviraj Kapoor and brother Shashi Kapoor received the award in 2015

 35 thousand pounds lost in the first round, the players who lost in the first round will also get 35 thousand pounds this year

 According to Federer, this money is enough
 grand slam main bhi atipi pranali lagu honi chahie atipi str par yadi aap nahin khelte ho tab bhi aapako saal main do baar raashi milti he
 Perhaps this reduces the list of injured players

 The Enforcement Directorate has been questioning Chanda Kochhar for hours for 2 consecutive days
 somvaar ko bhi 11 ghante kii poochtacha ke baad raat 10 baje ghar jane diya gaya

 Who doesn't want to look nice and beautiful? aksar achche kapadon ke liye naa jane aap kitne hi shopping malls or bazaaron ko chaan maarthi hai
 But you do not get clothes of your choice
 kai baar aise hota he ki hamen duusare logon kii dress pasand aa jaati he or ham bilkul waisi hi dress paane ke liye ghanton kai bazaaron ke chakkar lagane se bhi nahin darate lekin kai baar is khoj main niraashaa hi haath lagati he
 But through the new application of Google, it has become easy to get your favorite dress
 google kaa ye nayaa feechar aapke kharidari karne ke nazariye ko puri tarah badal degaa
 The motive behind this is quite simple, whenever you see a beautiful dress and want to buy it, take your phone's camera to that dress
 aisa karne se google kaa ye anokhaa feechar aapako wo dress yaa phir usase milti julati dress dikhaa degaa or aap use google shopping ke jariye kharid sakate hai
 Actually, this app works on image recognition technology
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki ab aap waisi dress, juute, chashme aasaani se kharid sakate hai jo aapke dost yaa kalig ke paas hai
 With this, you can already see the color, design of the thing you buy through the app
 fashneble chijen kharidne kaa ye koi pehla aisa ap nahin he
 An app named screenshop has come on the market last year
 lekin google kaa 'google lens ap' pehla aisa ap he jo sidhaa aapke phone ke camere se judaa hua he
 Pointing the camera at anything allows you to search the entire world on your phone

 Even though it was not a modern car, it was hated and even after the arrival of this car, the same hatred is true

 As soon as the matter of the cow came, the speech of good political parties started shivering, but what happened by the Dalits of Gujarat makes this event even bigger and historical

 We have Vijay Dewan Sahab from Pune to discuss this matter

 In 1982, at the age of 25, Vijay Dewan came here to work for skin whitening
 tab se mrit jaanwaron kii khaal utaarte hai
 In this work, no one gets support, no ride, so after stripping, they bring it on their back
 sadiyon se daliton ne jis kaam ke liye dansh saha, zehar piyaa, us dansh ko apni peeth par lad kar laate hai, jis kaam ke liye una ke daliton kii peeth par alumunium kii lathi barasaai gai
 In my view, there will be no better person than Vijay Dewan to discuss this issue
 unke anubhav aapako is masale par nae tareeke se sochane ke liye prerit kar sakate hai
 The vehicle by which the Dalit youths were tied is Xylo

 Symbol of our modernity and progress, this SUV is priced between eight and a half million

 The hate with which they are being killed has not been known in our society
 ye aadhunik car nahin thi tab bhi ye nafrat thi or is car ke aane ke baad bhi vahi nafrat hu-ba-hu he
 These soldiers are from Gujarat but they can be from anywhere
 balki tamaam ghatnaon main aise noujvaan mili hai jo daliton ke kilaaf hinsa main shaamil rahe hai
 The aluminum sticks in his hand suggest that he must have had an organized form
 kisi ko pataa karnaa chahie ki ye kahaan se paisa pate hai ki saadhe aath lakh kii zailo par chalate hai, usase dalit yuvakon ko baandh kar maarthe hai
 8 people involved in the assault have been arrested, 6 policemen have been suspended, there is talk of setting up a special court to hear the case, but it is also important to know that such people have so many resources Where do you come from ye kisase jude hai ki inke paas das se pandrah logon kaa gang jamaa ho jaataa he, kisi ko kanoon haath main lekar maarane ke liye
 a similar incident occurred on 22 May, 50 km from Una, but nothing special happened in that case
 daliton ko peeta gaya or video banaaya gaya tha
 The incident itself is as embarrassing as it is bold, the opposition to this event
 gaay kaa maamla aate hi achche-achche raajnneetik dalon kii jubaan kaanpane lagati thi, magar gujarat ke daliton ne jo kiya usase yah ghatana or bhi badi or aitihaasik ho jaati he
 The Dalit society loaded the dead cows on trucks and left the Collector office of Surendranagar leaving that we will not perform the last rites

 This is another matter, Dr
 Ambedkar had talked about giving up this work decades ago
 phir bhi haal philhal ke dashakon main puure bharat main kahin bhi gau rakshakon ke dussahas kaa aisa pratikaar nahin hua tha
 Perhaps this is why the enthusiasm of the cow guards increased so much that after beating these young men, everyone took them down and took a picture
 yah tasviir thane kii he
 Dalit youth are standing folded in the premises of the police station
 peeche nile rang se thana likhaa he

 On the night of 5 March 2016, members of a cow guard team near Shahabad, Haryana, allegedly caught an animal smuggler

 While hearing the case on 10 May 2016, the Punjab and Haryana High Court said that with the help of political masters and senior officials of the state government, including the police, the so-called self-proclaimed cow becomes a defense party and the law is in their hands Take it
 court ke sangyaan main aisi baaten ain hai ki ye dal kanoon todate hai or apane jaanwaron ke saath charvaahee ke liye ja rahe garib logon se vasuuli bhi karte hai
 They also get police from them

 There are some very good cow schools in our country
 inhen aap chhod den yaa inke baavjood tamaam shaharon main gaayen kachare ke dher main plastic kii thili khaane ke liye abhishpt hai
 There is no improvement in this condition
 panchayaton main gau char kii zamin par jin logon ne kabza kiya he uski suchi banegi to saare raajnneetik dal is bahes se chuttee le lenge
 How annoying is the injection that is injected to the cow for more milk
 phir bhi gau rakshakon kii sakriyata kii ghatnaayen koi bahut badi sankhya main nahin hui hai
 But the effect of panic spread from them is more than the number

 Home Minister Rajnath Singh has said that the Prime Minister is also sad over this incident

 The investigation work has been handed over to the CID

 9 days after the incident, the Chief Minister of the state went to Una and met the families of the victims
 vahaan unhen kaale jhande bhi dikhaaye gaye
 The government and the party and the National self-service Association also felt that the resentment this time was different
 indian express main aar es es ke gujarat praant ke sanchaalak mukesh malkan kaa bayaan chapa he ki ye hindu samaaj par hamalaa he jo bhaichaare or shanti main yakeen rakhata he
 The incident of atrocities against Dalit brothers in the name of Gau Raksha is very painful and condemnable
 is tarah kaa amanviya vyavhaar ek jaghanya aparaadh he or aisa karne waalon ko choda nahin janaa chahie
 It is interesting if Mukesh ji's statement is printed correctly
 inhen aghoshit rajnatik manyata praapt he
 Mukesh Malkan has described Una incident as an attack on Hindu society
 jab mukhyamantri anandiben una gayi to unke saath saath gaanv waalon ne jo kaha us par sirf gujarat hi nahin balki har rajya ko apane apane yahaan check karwaanaa chahie
 The comments 11 july kii ghatana kii gunj 19 or 20 july ko sansad main bhi sunai di
 It took 9 days to understand the mps of Opposition, there is so much anger among the Dalits of Gujarat
 sarkaar or vipaksh ke bich khub takaraar hue
 Now let's come to why we are doing prime time on this
 bina kisi vyapak sanghathan ke gujarat bhar main daliton kaa gussa sadakon par kaise chhalkaa, kya gujarat main dalit aakraamakata kaa koi nayaa daur he
 For this, Dalits from Ahmedabad are going to understand politics
 ab doosraa sawaal yah he ki kya gau raksha ke naam par ho rahe bavaalon par khulkar baat kar sakate hai
 Is this image correct that society thinks on this issue in the same way or will have to think

 Since then, they shed the skin of dead animals
 is kaam main kisi kaa saath nahin miltaa, koi sawari nahin milti, lihaaza khaal utaarne ke baad apni peeth par lad kar laate hai
 For centuries, the work for which the Dalits endured, bruised and poisoned, carried the bite on their back, for which the Una's Dalits were smeared with aluminum sticks
 meri nazar main vijay dewan se behatar koi doosraa nahin hoga is masale par baat karne ke liye

 He said that there is a link between the publisher, the writer and the reader
 kya chapana chahie or kya bazaar kii jarurat he, yah tay karne kaa kaam lekhak or prakaashak kaa hi he
 Maheshwari said that the one who possesses creativity stays in the market, apart from popularity, the level also needs to be taken care of, only then can the market be sold and sustained

 Some more measures have also been promised, especially for certain areas

 Keep a watchman to sleep peacefully and do not let him sleep
 alarm laga lo bhai
 It is better that we immediately understand the bogus model of the Prime Minister as a janitor
 jab se unhone khud ko chaukeedaar ghoshit kiya he, ve jaagate raho-jaagate raho ke alaava kuch nahin kar rahe hai
 Everyone's getting sleepy
 gali ke har makaan ke paas jaakar jaagate raho-jaagate raho bol kar nikal jate hai
 By the time people turn, the watchman has gone to another house
 aapane panchatantr kii kahaniyon se lekar filmon main dekha hoga, is tip ke chaukeedaar ke duusari gali main jate hi chori ho jaati he
 There has been a slowness in banks, buy shares manager-clerk, if not money, take a loan, the secret file has been stolen from the Ministry of Defense
 chori chaukeedaar ke pahunchane se pehle hui yaa baad main, manovinod kaa prashn he
 The Attorney General seems quite a creative person
 sikret file chori hone kii baat kar kai baaten kar deen
 All the reports published in 'the Hindu' were correct
 report ke bheetar chhapi rafaal saude main chori kii baton ko sahi bataa diya
 The secret from the government, that secret was dismissed
 ab sarkaar nahin kah sakati ki 'da hindu' main jo chapa he vah sahi jaankaree nahin he
 Is not part of his file
 isi baat par supreme court ko jaanch kaa aadesh de dena chahie
 How the secret file was stolen from the Ministry of Defense
 original kapi chori hui yaa photocopi
 Whether or not there are windows and doors in the room where the secret file is kept
 sikret file le jane- le aane kii prakriya kya he
 Whether there is a CCTV camera or not
 doosraa jab da hindu akhbaar main chhapi khabaren sahi hai to yah aarope sahi sabit hota he ki sarkaar ne supreme court ko sari jaankaree nahin di
 Otherwise, the Supreme Court should now tell that it is the same secret file that we found in a closed envelope! The stage of war is punished on the channels, Nayak has returned with the World Peace Prize, from January, write the report on the Rafale deal in N
 Ram 'the Hindu' newspaper Have been
 bataa rahe the ki kaise raksha mantralay ko andhere main rakhkar pradhanmantri karyaalay rafaal maamle main khud hi deal karne laga tha
 How big officials of the Ministry of Defense were objecting to this
 kaise rafaal kaa daam upie kii tulana main 41 pratishat zyaada he
 How the price of Rafale aircraft increases because of not giving bank guarantee
 'da hindu' kii sari report padhein
 It does not contain technical things related to Rafale which are secret
 agar sarkaar ko vaaki lagata he ki rafaal kii takniki jaankaree se sambandhit sikret out hua he to use tatkaal sauda radd kar dena chahie
 All these news were not published by Hindi newspapers
 unke chamache sampadakon kaa ek hi lakshya he
 Keep a secret file of every information that questions the government
 chhapo mat
 n Ram has said that he is serious about his source
 uske bare main jaanane kaa koi prayaas bhi na karen
 The scam is out only when the secret is out
 ghotaalaa out hone par file ko sikret bataane kaa formula pehali baar out hua he
 The news of all the scams from Bofors to 2G has been achieved in this way
 duniya bhar kii adaalaton main sweekaar hua he or unke aadhaar par jaanch aage badi he
 The government is caught red-handed
 file kii jaankaree ko sikret bataakar vah phir suraksha ke hangaame main batch nikalnaa chaahati he
 The Attorney General is a lawyer and a SHO of Ghazab
 kaash itani safai sieji ko aati
 Which has given reports on the Rafale deal prices to fool the public
 ank kii jagah a, ba, sa, ga, m, dha likhakar paise kaa hisaab kiya he or bataa diya he ki sab thik he
 The Attorney General has also questioned the CAG report in the Supreme Court citing the information of The Hindu as part of the secret file
 jab sikret file chori ho gai thi to sieji ne report kaise bana di, kya ye file sieji ko di gai thi?rail mantri ji, group di ke parikshaarthiyon ke kuch sawaal hai, jawaab de dempradhanmantri modi ko rafaal maamla peechha kar rahaa he
 Like guilt
 ve har us mauka kaa istamaal karte hai jisamen ve rafaal ko lekar lage aaropon se peechha chhudaa saken
 For him, he is wearing a protective shield of lies
 pulavama ke baad aaparishan balakot ke hote hi kehane lage ki rafaal hota to ye ho jaataa
 His statement was of Jagrat Raho Syndram
 aadhi-adhuri jaankaree ke aadhaar par logon ko jagaae rakhane kaa prayaas chamatkaari baba hi karata he
 What do common people know about how the defense of aircraft is prepared in the air
 usamen rafaal aage hota yaa sukhoi 30 aage hota
 The Chowkidar village does not know what the army is, the security system of the police station
 wo sirf raat bhar ghoomane ke liye hota he
 It is not the ultimate and highest guarantee of security
 buniyadi guarantee zarur he
 The Prime Minister should not call himself a watchman in everything
 khud ko chaukeedaar or pradhan sevak kehete kehete bhul gaye hai ki ve bharat ke pradhanmantri hai
 So stay awake, keep awake and speak anything
 andher nagari chaupat kheti, take ser jhansa, take ser jumala, kheti main fail modi sarkarpradhanmantri ke is chaukeedaari model se saavdhaan rahen
 This model is bogus
 vaise pradhanmantri ab bhi ek kaam kar sakate hai
 You can find the secret file by going to the seventh system
 jis par vahi sab sikret baaten hai jinke bare main unhen bataate hue unke haath kaanpate hai
 You know when hands tremble
 kerala ke kathith lav jehad maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue supreme court ne somvaar ko saaf kiya ki agar ladki balig he, to aise maamalon main uski sahmati sabase zyada ahmiyat rakhti he
 With this, the Supreme Court asked the NIA investigating the case whether there is any law that prevents anyone from falling in love with the criminal
 supreme court ne tamaam daleelon ko sunne ke baad maamle kii sunwaayee 27 november tak taal di or hadiya ke pita se agali sunwaayee main use court ke samaksh pesh karne ko kaha he

 When asked by family members, she told that she has converted to Islam
 kuch samay baad vah apane selem sthit college jane ke bahaane ghar se chali gai

 Through the Truth Table, Akhila met a woman named Sanba

 Accused of misleading the daughter, Sanba signed Akhila on a certificate made in the name of Hadiya
 janvari 2016 main akhila ne apane pita ko patr likhakar kanoonee tareeke se dharm parivartan karne kii baat bataai
 Her father then filed a petition in the court accusing Abubakar of seducing her daughter
 court ne akhila ko satya sharni se islam padhane kii ijaajat di
 In December 2016, the SC ordered an inquiry to the NIA, she was married to a man named Chaffin Jahan

 amitabh bachchan ke liye bollywood main ek kahawat he ki wo jis film ko haath lagaate hai, wo sona ho jaati he
 This has been seen for many decades
 lekin vigyaapan jagat main amitabh kuch khaas jalwe nahin dikhaa paae
 Amitabh's ads are quite exciting
 lekin dekha jaae to cinema jagat kii sabase badi hasti hone ke naate wo kisi product kii bikri achambhit rup se nahin badha paae
 Conversely, there are some products for which a mountain of troubles broke out after advertising, both on the product itself and also on Big b itself
 megi vivaad:abhi haal hi main chal rahe megi vivaad ne amitabh bachchan ko tension main daal diya
 Due to excess quantity of lead in Maggi, its production was banned and orders were issued to remove it from all shops and shopping malls
 lekin itnaa kaaphi nahin tha
 Big b was also pulled into the dock
 un par aarope laga ki agar koi utpaada swasthya ke liye itnaa hanikaarak he to wo kaise uskaa vigyaapan yaa prachaar kar sakate hai!philhal to bachchan sahab is aadhaar par bache hue hai ki kaaphi samay pehle hi apana contract khatm ho jane kii vajah se unhone megi kaa vigyaapan band kar diya tha
 So now they have nothing to do with it
 ab jab pehle big bi iskaa vigyaapan kiya karte the, us samaymegi kii gunvattta kisi theis par koi sawaal nahin uthaa saktaa
 But whatever, Maggie was neither lucky for Big b nor Big b for Maggie
 maaruti sujuki varasa kii bhi hui thi taany taany fiss:oktober 2001 main brands ambesder ke taur par amitabh bachchan ne maaruti sujuki kii pehali multiprpaj car varasa launch kii
 The company invested 300 to 400 crores in its production
 target rakhaa kii har maheene kam se kam 1000 varasa kaaren to bikni chahie
 But even half of its results were not revealed
 aakhirkaar thak harkar kuch saalon main company ko varasa car hi band kerani padi
 Pepsi was also broken on the mountain of troubles: Pepsi is one of the leading brands in the world in soft drinks
 bharat main iskaa market badhaane ke liye company ne brands ambesader banaaya sadi ke mahanayake bachchan sahab ko
 The product's sales increased immensely
 lekin kuch samay baad is par cese kar diya gaya ki isamen keetanunashak kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jo ki swasthya ke liye bilkul bhi thik nahin he
 a 5-member joint parliamentary committee investigating allegations of chemicals in soft drinks in India had submitted its report in Parliament
 report main ek gaiyr sarkari paryaavaranvaadi sanghathan centre for science and enwyranment (siesai) ke in nateezon ko sahi bataaya gaya tha ki pepsy ke peyon main khatarnaak rasayan mili hote hai
 At that time Big b was the brand ambassador of the company
 is samay sabhi reporton main kaha gaya tha ki agar in kitnashkon kaa lambey samay tak seven kiya jaae to inase cancer, rog pratirohak kshamta main gadabadi, prajnan sambandhi bimaariyaan or mastishk ko bhi nuksaan hone kaa khatra rahata he
 Then Amitabh Bachchan said that he stopped promoting Pepsi the same day when a girl asked him why do you promote the brand that our teacher called Zahra
 chocolate main se bhi nikle the keede:cadabri jaisi badi company ke liye bhi lucky sabit nahin ho paae the big bi
 In 2003, when Amitabh Bachchan was the brand ambassador of Dairy milkchocolate
 tab cadabri ke ek packet main keedaa paaya gaya tha
 This was also confirmed after laboratory investigation
 chocolate main keedaa pehle pune main, phir mumbai or uske baad nagpur main paaya gaya tha
 Cadbury India, while dismissing its stand, said that the mess was from the seller and not the company's factory, but Big b was also involved at the time
 sadi ke sabase bade mahanayake par aisa aarope nahin lagaaya ja saktaa ki kisi product ke saath unke judane se aisi gadabadiyaan huin
 But there is one thing, some products become pebbles by the touch of which films become gold! Sorry, Mr
 Bachchan, we also do not intend that this happens every time
 aakhir kalyaan jewelers, gujarat tourism, isiaisiai prudenshial, tanishk jewelers, boroplas antiseptic kriim or navratna tel jaise kai utpaada hai jo abhi tak chaiyn kii saans le rahe hai

 North Gujarat is considered a stronghold of Congress
 modi lahar main congress uttar gujarat main jeet kaa paracham laharaati rahi he
 In this time of the assembly elections, there is more rebel headache for Congress than BJP
 congress ke 19 baagiyon ne chunavi maidan main utarkar congress ke satta main vaapasi kii raah main roda ban gaye hai
 The 16 rebels of the Congress in North Gujarat are against 16 Congress rebels in North Gujarat and they have not withdrawn their nomination against the official candidate of the party
 isse congress kaa sameekaran bigadataa hua najar aa rahaa he
 The Congress's stronghold comes in six districts in Uttar Pradesh, Gandhinagar, Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, Aravali, Mehsana and Patan
 inamen jilon main kul 32 vidhansabha siten he
 In the last assembly election, the Congress has managed to win more than half the seats in North Gujarat
 congress ne 32 siton main se 17 siten or bijepi ne 15 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 Let me tell you that the Congress had won some seats with very few votes
 aise main party ke baagi ummidavaar ke utarane se congress ke liye musiibat bad gai he
 The biggest challenge for Congress in Banaskantha is the biggest challenge is in Banaskantha district of North Gujarat
 congress ke saamne yahaan paanch vidhansabha siton par baagi maidan main hai
 These include Thard, Vadgam, Desa, Deodar and Kankrej constituencies
 tharam main congress ne bidi rajput ko mavjibhai patel ke jagah maidan main utaara he
 Whereas in 2012, Mavji Patel lost to bjp's Parbatbhai Patel by 3473 votes
 is mavjibhai patel baagi ke rup main maidan main hai unhone apane naam waapas lene se inkaar kar diya he
 Two Congress rebels against Jignesh are thus in the Vadgam assembly seat for Jignesh Mevani, who came out with the support of Congress
 mewaani ke khilaaf congress ke do baagi maidan main he
 Ashwin Parmar and Balkrishna are Jiraval
 dilachasp baat ye hai ki vaadgam congress ke liye sabase surakshit seat maani jaati he
 In the last election, Congress won this seat by 21000 votes

 India's referendum is again faced with a new version of its historical dilemma, whether it needs a very powerful central government or a state to balance power! India needs a government of the all-india party or the rainbow of regional parties, which had grown after 1991 and in 2014 after 'kamaloday' on most of the geography of the country
 yah prashn 1991 ke baad se hi bhartiya raajnneeti ko mathne laga tha ki ab akhil bhartiya rajnatik dal banane ke liye kisi party ko aakhir karnaa kya hoga? ekmaatr akhil bhartiya party congress kaa ksharan ho chukaa tha
 After liberalization and privatization, the economic powers of the central government became limited and the powers of the states kept increasing
 iske saath hi khatm ho gai thim chunaavon main akhil bhartiya lahar! phir kya bachaa tha kisi akhil bhartiya dal ke paas jise lekar vah puure desh ko sambodhit kar sake?narendra modi ke paas vikalp simit the
 National security or the fear of Pakistan was the only subject on which the state governments would raise questions
 yah unke adhikaar main hi nahin he
 The BJP has used it to blunt the expectations of the states and has tried to embrace the need of a powerful center for the sake of security
 akhil bhartiya party banane ke liye kisi bhi dal ko shaktishaalee centre sarkaar gadhani padati he
 Modi too had to do all this after 2014, as the Chief Minister, from which he would probably never agree
 rajyon ke najariye se modi raaj, uttar nehru yug kii indira congress jaisaa hi rahaa
 States were repeatedly intimidated
 sarkarein (uttarakhand, or arunachal) barkhaast huin jo supreme court kii madad se waapas se lautin
 Central investigative agencies were so politically used that three state governments revolted against the CBI
 yahi nahin, pichley saal april main dakshini rajyon ne centre par sansadhano ke bantwaare main bhedbhaav kaa aarope lagaaya or vitt ayog par sawaal uthaae
 In fact, the conflation of balanced central versus balanced power states is as old as the Constitution
 1947 main bantwaare ke liye mountbeton plan kii ghoshnaa ke teen din ke bheetar hi samvidhan sabha kii up samiti ne behad shaktishaalee adhikaron se las centre vaali sanvaidhanik vyavastha kii sifarish kii thi
 It was Ambedkar who, while balancing the Constituent Assembly's urge towards a powerful center, agreed on a constitution that gave power to the center in times of crisis but generally worked on the federal (balanced rights to states) principle
 shaktishaalee centre ko lekar apane aagrah ke baavjood, samvidhan banane ke baad nehru ne adhikansh maamalon main rajyon kii salaah lee
 He wrote 378 letters to states during his tenure, ie one letter per 16th day
 achraj nahin ki samvidhan lagu hone ke baad banane vaali pehali sanstha vitt ayog (1951) thi jisane centre par rajya ke aarthik rishton kaa swaroop tay kiya
 (reference: Balveer Arora, Granville Austin, b
 aar
 Nanda's books) Before the 2019 elections, Modi had come to the conclusion that he wanted a big All India wave from 2014
 jo us satta virdohi lahar ko parrast kar sake jis par sawari karte hue ve rajya dar rajya jitate chale gaye the or jo ab gathbandhanon ke netritv main palat kar un ke khilaaf khadi hone lagi thi
 Coalition governments are not new, nor have they fared poorly
 lekin pehali baar desh kii sabase badi party, jo gathbandhanon ke sahare yahaan tak ai he, vah kshetreey dalon ko desh kii suraksha ke liye khatra bataakar taqatvar centre ke liye vot maang rahi he
 In fact, by the time Modi arrived, all India waves (BJP got only 31 per cent votes in 2014) had become history
 vittiya adhikaron ke bantwaare se lekar chunavi pratinidhitiv tak shaktishaalee centre kii sankalpana bhi pigal chuki he
 In the initial elections, the regional parties had around 35 seats in the Parliament which increased to 160 in the last Lok Sabha
 isi kram main loksabhaa chunaavon main unke voton kaa hissaa 4 fisadi se badhkar 34 fisadi par pahunch gaya
 The role of states in development in the country has become more central than the center
 yahi vajah he ki bahumat kii shaktishaalee sarkaar ke mukaable, sirf paanch saal ke bheetar hi bharat kaa sanghavaad uth kar khadaa ho rahaa he
 Despite not wanting, this election is focused on the politics of the states
 bhaajapa shasit rajyon main vipaksh kii vaapasi isaki shuruyaat thi
 Whatever may be the outcome of May 23, but the new government of the Republic of India will probably regain the center-state balance that collapsed in 2014
 *** During the 17th Bharat Rang Mahotsav in Delhi, the play 'of Mice and Man' based on John Steinbach's novel was staged
 naatak kaa nirdesan hema singh ne kiya, jabaki kahani ke centre main america main aae 'mahaan mandi' ke samay ko rakhaa gaya
 This phase is about to begin from the stock market crash of October 1929 to the Second World War
 is mandi ke kaaran sthaneey naukariyon me baari giravat or iske kaaran ghumantu kamgaaron kii sankhya main badhotaree ko naatak ke jariye dikhaaya gaya
 It had a large number of men, who wandered from city to city in search of small jobs
 yah naatak america kamgaaron ke vaastavik ummiido or sapanom ko darshaati he
 The play elevates the lives of the poor and the underprivileged to a deeply elevated symbolic level
 maanav astitv kii prakruti kaa gambhir sabak prastut karti he or manushya ke sapanom, ekankipan jaise kai vishyon ko chooti he
 All the characters in the play were loners at one time or another
 is dauraan ve asahaay dikhte hai or us samay main bhi ye paatr apane se kamjor ko nasht karne se baj nahin aate
 The story tells that repression is not just through the hands of the powerful, but anyone can suppress it
 shakti jo dusron ko dabaane main istemaal hoti he
 The form in which George and Lenny, the main characters of this play, plan to live are not really there
 lekin yah in donon ke man main ek vaastavik jagah kii tarah vidyaman he
 It becomes a symbol of George and Lenny's relationship and it becomes their habit to keep talking about their dreams

 Even after demonetisation, the currency operations have increased in the market
 khud sarkaar ne sansad main yah jaankaree di he
 The government has also accepted that the higher the cash in the market, the greater the corruption
 sarkaar ne mana he ki duniya bhar main nakadi or galat gatividhiyon ke bich gaharaa rishta paaya jaataa he
 Actually, MP Ram Preet Mandal had three questions to the Finance Minister in the Lok Sabha
 unhone poocha tha ki kya notebandi ke baad pichley varshon kii tulana main mudra kaa parichaalan bad gaya he
 If yes, what is the details of the beginning of demonetisation and currency operations in the country till March 2019
 saansad ne yah bhi poocha tha ki mudra parichaalan main vruddhi ke kaaran arthvyavastha par kya nakaaratmak prabhaav padate hai
 Replying to the Lok Sabha, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman admitted that the currency had increased in operations since November 2016
 unhone bataaya ki 4 november 2016 kii sthiti ke anusaar noton kaa kul mulya 17,741 billian rupee the
 21,137 of the currency in circulation as on 29 March 2019
 64 billian rupee tha
 This shows that the currency operations increased by Rs 3396 billion after demonetisation
 yahaan bataa den ki ek billian baraabar sau karod hota he
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also mentioned that there is a mention in Volume One of the Economic Review 2016-17 that there is a deep correlation between cash and wrongdoings around the world
 transperency international ke aankalan ke anusaar parichaalan main nagdi jitani adhik hogi, bhrashtachar utana hi adhik hoga
 It is believed from the reply of the Finance Minister that corruption is also expected to increase due to increasing cash operations in the country

 The song has been given voice by Sukriti Kakkar and Siddharth Mahadevan
 shankar ehsaan loy is gane ke mujeec diarector hai or ise likhaa he javed akhtar ne
 Ranveer Singh is playing the role of Kabir Mehra and Anushka Farah Ali in the film 'dil Dhadakne Do'
 'dil dhadkane do' kahani he ek punjabi parivaar kii jo ek krooj trip par jate hai or kai sari ghatnayen ghatati hai
 The film also stars Anil Kapoor, Shefali Shah, Ranveer Singh, Priyanka Chopra, Anushka Sharma and Farhan Akhtar
 yah film 5 june 2015 ko relies hone ja rahi he
 Watch the song 'dil Dhadakne Do' for the first time: vahiin reverse repo rate, jaisaa ki naam se hi lagata he, reverse repo rate upar bataae gaye repo rate se ulta hua
 Think of it like this: Banks often have a large balance left over after a day's work
 bank vah rakam apane paas rakhane ke jaay rigerv bank main rakh sakate hai, jis par unhen arabiai se byaaj bhi miltaa he
 The rate at which they receive this interest is called reverse repo rate
 vaise kai baar rigerv bank ko lagata he ki bazaar main bahut zyada nakadi ho gai he tab vah reverse repo rate main badhotaree kar detaa he
 It happens that banks start keeping their money with the Reserve Bank to earn more interest

 mukhya dwaar se kinare kaa galiyara outahouse main jaakar khatm hota he jisamen ek-duusare se alag kai kamare hai
 In these rooms called the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) warrooms, the Yadav family sits here and deliberates strategies, besides meeting with their loyalists
 ek kamare ke adhkhule daravaaje ko dhakeliye to lalu kii pehali santan 37 varshiya misa bharti 12 ghante ke thakaaoo prachaar abhiyaan ke baad bhi muskaraate hue swaagat karti hai
 His eyes are burdened with fatigue and the busyness of publicity has deprived him of his beloved serial 'bade Achhe Lagte Hain'
 lekin kursi par ghoomte hue jab ve kaagajon ke dher ko palatati hai or apane mobile samsung gallexi par kisi ko massej karne ke liye ungliyaan phiraati hai to ve aaj bhi dashak bhar pehle kii embibies kii us chaatra kii tarah lagati hai jiske liye pariksha kii purv sandhya main kaaphi kuch doharaana baaki rah gaya he
 Misa started her political career at a time when countless challenges have arisen in front of rjd's first family
 lalu prasad congress se gathjod ko antim rup dene or tikat baantne ke pehle hi apane chaar vidhayakon ko kattar virdohi nitish kumaar ke haathon ganvaa chuke hai
 Ram Vilas Paswan has gone to the bjp's court, which was sent by the RJD to the Rajya Sabha in 2010
 or, ab sabase prabhavi vafaadaar ramkripal yadav bhi patliputra seat se misa bharti ko ummidavaar banaae jane se khafa hokar jaani dushman ban gaye hai
 He was also sent to the Rajya Sabha by Lalu in 2010
 ramkripal ab bijepi ke tikat par patliputra se misa ke khilaaf morche par aa date hai
 However, Misa says, "we will overcome the challenges
 ” phir ve thodaa garv se bataati hai, ''aakhirkaar meraa naam aaazaad bharat ke ek sabase prasiddh andolan kaa pratik jo he
 Lalu named his elder daughter during the Emergency after the most dangerous law Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA)
 1977 main jab beti kaa janm hua us vakt lalu misa ke tahat jail main the
 Now after 37 years, Misa has made up her mind to free her father from anxiety and insecurities
 is gold medalist embibies doctor ke bare main kai tarah kii kinvadantiyaan chal padi hai kyonki patliputra kii pratishthit seat unke pita 2009 main haar gaye the
 The legacy of the family, when the initiative was taken to move towards sons Tejashwi Yadav and Tej Pratap, is said to be an adventurous warrior, who himself has inherited that success
 unki pahal ko ek aisi beti kii pahal mana ja rahaa he jo pita ke bikharate samrajya ko dekhakar vyathit thi
 He adopted the losing Lok Sabha seat of Lalu in such a way that even the most trusted loyalist of the family, Ramkripal Yadav, reached the enemy camp
 do betiyon kii yah maa apane pita kaa haath majboot karne aage aa chuki he
 Of course, they have yet to prove their ability but Lalu's ingenuity and Rabri's spontaneity are coddled
 bhai tejasvi or tej pratap ke vipareet vah kaaphi sulajhi hui he
 Like Maa Rabri, she does not always speak well, but speaks thoughtfully
 ve ab bhi apane pita ko chhod gaye purv sahyogiyon ko chachaa hi pukaarti hai
 Says a party leader, "misa is articulate and loves to face challenges
 aakhirkaar unhone patliputra ko chunaa jahaan se unke pita 2009 main haar gaye the jabaki aasaan seat saaran ko maa rabari ke liye chhod diya jahaan se lalu 2009 main jeet gaye the
 There are also discussions in the party that Misa wants to defeat Ranjan Yadav more than her political career
 patliputra seat par 2009 main lalu ko jedy (you) ke tikat par ranjan yadav ne hi haraaya tha
 Sometimes these two were close friends and Lalu had sent them to Rajya Sabha
 misa ke iiem-lakhanu ke digridhari pati shailesh kehete hai, ''siyaasi kariyar kaa shriganesh hi makasad hota to misa rajyasabha kii surahnit raah chunatin
 But they have to change the lives of people
 ” misa ko patliputra main apane unheen chaachaaon se chunauti mil rahi he jinhen lalu ne samay-samay par rajyasabha main bheja: ramkripal yadav ko bhi or ranjan yadav ko bhi
 JD (U) and BJP are yet to be decided, while Misa is constantly roaming around in Pataliputra
 vaise ve patliputra kii hi bahu hai lekin ilaake kaa vistrut bhugolic gyaan unhen utana nahin he
 Yet he has memorized many of those things
 masalan unhen kahaan-kahaan janaa he, kin logon se milanaa he or koun se mudde uthaane hai
 His speeches are completely spontaneous
 embibies karne ke baad unhone doctorl to nahin kii lekin prachaar ke dauraan ve aalaa lagaae rakhana nahin bhuulatin
 The village women start sharing health concerns as soon as they meet them
 misa bhi unke bacchon kii jaanch main kotahi nahin baratatin or dawaaiyon tathaa paushtik aahaar kii salaah lage haath de detii hai
 She also informs voters about health rights in her speeches
 misa kii chhavi pragatisheel mahila kii banaai gai taaki party kii chhavi ko puraani raajnneeti se aage le jaaya ja sake
 Though Misa's focus is Pataliputra, but party supporters point to her lofty goal
 abhi unke liye raajnneeti main ye shuruaati din hai isliye unhen apni vyaktigat or party kii gatividhiyon main santulan bithaana padataa he
 She is displeased with the question that family compulsions compelled her to enter politics
 ve kahati hai, ''haa, main lalu ji kii beti hum, yahi apane main badi yogyata he
 But this also gives me additional responsibility and challenges
 maine raajnneeti ke bich hi saans lenaa siikhaa
 The children of leaders also have political rights
 kya nahin hone chahie?”ve yah bhi sweekaar karti hai ki unke chunaav ladgaye kaa faisla do saal pehle hi ho chukaa tha
 When Lalu went to jail last year, the decision was confirmed because he cannot contest elections
 haalanki ramkripal sanket dete hai ki unke patliputra se ladgaye kii ichha kii jaankaree party netaaon ko thi lekin sachai yah bhi he ki misa ke patliputra se chunaav ladane kii bhi jaankaree party main har kisi ko thi
 The RJD leader says, "we all knew six months in advance that Misa would fight Pataliputra
 ”misa ko jaanane vaale unki rajnatik buddhi kii tarif karte hai
 When Lalu was upset after the announcement of tickets, she went to his house to celebrate him and waited for six hours in the eyes of the TV cameras
 unhone apana tikat ramkripal ko dene kii peshkash bhi kar di
 When Ramkripal got caught in this trap and accepted the fight, Lalu refused
 tab misa pita ke faisle ke saath ho gayi
 Now, she appreciates senior party leaders Abdul Bari Siddiqui and Raghuvansh Prasad Singh on every occasion
 ye netaa lalu ke aage kabhi nahin jhuke or apni swatantra haisiyat banaae rakhi
 Misa has inherited a passion for politics
 embibies ke dinon main ve badminton champion bhi thim
 He also thought of pursuing a career in sports or becoming a pediatrician
 lekin samay bitne ke saath misa apni siyaasi jadon kii ore laut ai hai
 But it is still not clear whether Lalu has really made Misa his political successor
 yah baat kisi se chuphi nahin he ki chote bete tejasvi unki pehali pasand hai
 When Lalu went to jail, Tejashwi was facing the media cameras along with his mother
 yah baat digar he ki unki umr abhi loksabhaa chunaav ladgaye laayak nahin hui he, lihaaja misa ne kaman sanbhali he
 Even when Lalu was in jail, there were reports that Misa wanted to play an active role in politics
 ab ve chunaav maidan main hai or is yuva doctor ko sabit karnaa he ki ve siyasat kii nabj pakad sakati hai yaa nahin
 Union Minister for Women and Child Development, Maneka Gandhi, has declared the verdict of the Marineshimala temple to be a historic court unhone kaha ki yah bahut acchhee baat he hindu dharm ko sabko jod kar rakhata he

 In his open letter to a section of the media, Gandhi said, "the appointment of the Chief Information Commissioner by the current Prime Minister so far is an attempt to weaken it
 ' Gandhi was appointed to the post of Central Information Commissioner in the year 2008 and served in the post till 2012

 ye log nandigram or singoor main maare gaye the
 He then accused the Left Front of committing atrocities
 jabaki ab mamata aarope laga rahi hai ki bijepi kaa shapath grahan main aamantran niraadhaar he
 Mamata Banerjee 'own oath-taking on May 20, 2011, was attended by the families of "victims of political violence in Nandigram and Singur"

 So her charge that BJP has devalued an "august occasion" is hollow

 They have nothing to do with politics, there is no such record
 sori narendra modi ji, isi vajah se main aapke shapath grahan samaaroh main shaamil nahin ho paaungi

 After Narendra Modi's entry, in the politics of the state, saffron glory went on Uruz in every direction

 haalanki, 2002 kaa chunaav unhen shikast dekar gaya
 This time the Congress fielded Arjun Modhwadia and defeated Babubhai
 2007 main bhi arjuna modhwadiya ne hi is seat se jeet darj kii
 Subsequently, in 2012, Babubhai Bokhiriya made a comeback and managed to save his seat
 unhone arjuna modhwadiya ko kareeb 17 hajaar voton se shikast di

 haalanki, wo pichhlaa chunaav haar gaye the, lekin siyaasi jaankaar maanate hai ki babu bokhiria ko arjuna modhwadiya jaise bade netaa hi haraa sakate hai
 This is the reason why the Congress has accepted this challenge by taking out against Babu Bokhiria instead of finding a safe seat for its senior leader

 Otherwise, it would have taken a lot of effort to cross the airplane for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 in sab ke baavjood ek baat samaj main nahin aa rahi he ki ek maah purv sapa pramukh ne sarkaar ke sau din puure hone par mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko sau main se sau nambar de die the, kuch din pehle hi vah sarkaar kii karypranali par prashnchihn lagaate hue 'naaraazgi' jaahir kii

 "he says that four and a half months of Akhilesh government has spent only changing the names of public welfare schemes run by 'bahnji'
 bujurg raajnneetik vishleshak ranvir singh chouhan kaa maananaa he ki mulaayam ne kaaryakarini kii baithak main aisi naseehat dekar vipaksh ko ghar baithe mudda pakadaa diya he
 He says, "from the beginning, the BSP, BJP and Congress have been accusing SP workers of indiscipline and indecency, which Mulayam has admitted
 "kul milakar yah kahana galat na hoga ki bete kii sarkaar se naakhush mulaayam singh ab 'mulaayam' nahin 'kathor' ho chuke hai, agar samay rahete sarkaar se jude log apane 'aacharan' main sudhaar kar 'samaajawaadee' hone kaa parichay nahin diya to unhen khamiyaja bhugatna pad saktaa he

 One photo of Turkish President Erdogan, which is being discussed the most while doing 'face Time' with a reporter, is because he himself compared Twitter to 'killer's knife', said- He did not tweet-smit and vowed that Twitter would be erased from the country

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator The Congress, which is betting on the Muslim equation with the Brahmins and Rajputs in the politics of Uttar Pradesh, is now set to take it a step further
 sutron ke mutabik, apane sameekaran ke lihaaj se chehre chunane ke baad ab party har dharm ke pichde savarnon ko 10 fisadi ke liye aarakshan kaa prastaav rakhane kaa man bana rahi he
 The special thing is that through every religion, poor Muslims will be included in it
 saaf he ki congress apane sameekaran ko har keemat par majboot karnaa chaahati he
 Congress leader Pramod Tiwari said that it was the Congress that gave reservation to the Dalits and backward, adding that if the demand arose, the party would consider it and decide on the appropriate forum
 sonia-rahul dikhaaenge hari jhandiis bich sansad main achaanak dalit mudda garmaane ke chalate congress ne upi main apana prachaar abhiyaan ko ek din ke liye aage badha diya he
 Now on 23, 24 and 25 July there will be a promotional campaign, instead of Lucknow, the journey will start from UP Gate (delhi UP Border)
 pehali raat main rukne kaa kaarykram ab bareli kii jagah muradabad kar diya gaya he, baaki sab pehle jaisaa hi rahegaa
 On July 23, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi will flag off the yatra
 rahul or priyanka ke saamne diya ye prastaavupi congress kii nayi timne is silsile main rahul or priyanka ke saamne ye prastaav diya, jis par donon ne saidhantik sahmati de di he
 In future, the party will include it in its manifesto
 party ko lagata he ki, iske jariye wo hindu or muslim varg ke savarna naujavaanon ko apane paale main khinch sakati he
 The head of the high command, which is on the draft, has bluntly told the UP leaders that there will be no tampering of the reservation system at present
 garib savarnon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan kaise diya jaayegaa, iskaa masauda bhi saamne laayaa jaye, jisase janata ko bharosa ho sake ki ye sirfchunavi vaadanheen he
 The opinion of the workers and public will also be taken
 The party will make its manifesto only after taking the opinion of the workers and different sections of the public
 isiilie is maamle main bhi party kaaryakartaaon or janata kii raay lekar hi ghoshnaptr main isko daalaa jayega
 Changed Congress in the Revenge In the 2012 UP assembly elections, the Congress promised reservation to backward Muslims
 party par muslim tushtikaran ke tamaam aarope bhi lage the
 The party collapsed in the state when the election results came
 uske baad loksabhaa chunaav kii karaari haar kii samiksha ke liye bani antony kamity ne party kii janata ke bich bani pro muslim chhavi ko jimmedaar mana tha
 That is why the party is now making strides
 apni puraani chhavi bhi todane kii koshish main ab wo ye nayaa shigupha lekar ai he
 After 27 years, away from power in UP, the party is ready to take every step which can return the golden days in its state

 philhal ab tak priyanka gandhi ke upi daure ko lekar koi soochna saamne nahin ai he

 diwali par dilli main phute pataakhon ke kaaran sadakon par badi maatra main kooda ikattha ho gaya tha, jise agle din emsidi ne sadakon se uthaakar landphil citon tak pahunchaaya
 According to information received from the three mcds of Delhi on the next day of Diwali, a total of over six thousand metric tonnes of garbage was picked up from the streets of Delhi
 agar baat purvi dilli nagar nigam kii karen, to nigam ke dames vibhaag ne purvi dilli ke ilaakon se 1,143 metric tankudouthaya
 As of 4 pm on Friday, 625 metric tonnes of garbage was picked up from areas of Shahdara North Zone and 518 MT from Shahdara South Zone
 iske alaava purvi dilli ke kai ilaakon se kooda nahin uthaae jane kii shikaayatein ain
 After this, Mayor Neema Bhagat himself picked up garbage in these areas under his supervision
 meyar ko shikaayat milane ke baad 15 autotippar ko kooda uthaane main lagaaya gaya
 In addition, the South MCD Dems Department collected about 3,850 metric tonnes of garbage
 nigam ke mutabik 3,850 metric tankudeko sirf uthaaya hi nahin gaya, balki kooday kaa niptaan is tarah se kiya gaya ki behad kam sankhya main kooda landphil site tak pahunche
 At the same time, in the areas of North Delhi, more than one thousand metric tons of garbage had accumulated on Diwali
 shuukravaar ko north emsidi ne 1,040 metric ton kooday ko bhalswa landphil site par pahunchaaya
 It is clear with so much garbage in Delhi that despite the Supreme Court ban on the sale of firecrackers, fireworks were fiercely

 a police officer said, "mobile Internet services have been stopped in the entire valley
 keval beasenel kii postped seva kaam kar rahi he
 'he said that to maintain law and order and to avoid rumors, the service was discontinued in the entire valley at midnight

 On July 9, the authorities shut down the mobile internet facility in the entire valley
 tippaniyan Postpaid services were restored on 26 July and the incoming facility on prepaid numbers was started a day later, but the outgoing facility on prepaid remained closed
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he

 kuch saal pehle haji ali par faisle se bhi aisa hi kuch hua tha, jahaan langik aadhaar par laga pratibandh vastav main sufiwaad kii bhaavana ke bilkul vipareet tha
 In Sufism, patron saints have been welcoming all the women and men of the sect
 media main ai khabaron ke mutabik sabarimala par aae faisle ke khilaaf pandalam ke shahi parivaar ke aahvaan par pathanmathitta jile main bade paimaane par virodh pradarshan hue hai
 Journalists showed that women were also largely involved in these demonstrations
 sach to yah he ki ve ek aise faisle ke khilaaf naare laga rahi thim, jisane unki garima kii raksha kii he or isiilie yah badi vidambnaa he
 In view of all this, the question can be raised about what should happen to Islam? al-bakr, the sura of the Quran, talks clearly about women's menstruation: "O Prophet, if they ask you about menstruation, then tell them that it is a time of" Adhan "(suffering)
 behatar hoga ki ve (mard) unase (auraton se) dur rahen (yon sambandh na banaaen), jab tak ve apane ayyaam (maahvaaree ke din) nahin puure kar letin or apane ko saaf-suthra nahin kar letin
 These lines have been used for centuries to prevent women from getting involved in any work related to religion
 "yat-hurn'' shabd ko, jiskaa matlab he "saaf, pavitra'', yah jataane ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he ki saaf-safai ke pehle ve "gandi'' thim
 Men and women will clean themselves before performing the namaz, which is the instruction of the Quran, which means cleaning the fluids released from the body after menstruation or sex before offering namaz
 quran main maine kahin bhi ek line bhi saaf taur se aisi likhi hui nahin dekhi he ki aisi mahilaon ko dharmik kaaryon se dur rakhaa jaae
 The Arabic word "adhan" refers to "pollution" in most interpretations offered by men to the Quran
 is arth ne hi langik bhedbhaav kii raah kholi he
 Men use this word to mean "impurity" (filth), it is used to control and enhance women
 dharm se sambandhit sabhi masalon main auraton ko kamatar mana jaataa he, kyonki unako maahvaaree aati he
 Man is superior, because he does not know menstruation
 is tark kii yahi ek anivaary shart he
 In the past years, i have learned the Quran only and only for the interpretation of Islam
 main iske sirf ek vyakhyaakaar par bharosa karti hum, moulana abul kalam aaazaad, jo ek mard hai
 Millions of people like me know Maulana as the most generous and knowledgeable person
 unki tarjumanul quran par koi bhi sawaal nahin khadaa kar saktaa
 Azad says that the distance between menstruation is not because the woman becomes "impotent", but because in those days, having sex is considered "mujir" (harmless)
 isi raushnee main yah daawa kiya ja saktaa he ki maahvaaree ke dauraan ramajaan kaa rojaa rakhana kathin ho saktaa he, yaa namaaj ke dauraan "mukhya or "sijada'' jaise kaary mushkil ho sakate hai
 But patriarchy caught a few words and put restrictions on many tasks for women in such days
 jab main yauvan kii dahalij par pahunchi or meri maahvaaree shuru hui to un dinon main mujhase namaaj na padhgaye ko kaha jaataa
 After the completion of the menstrual cycle, i was instructed to bathe in a special way
 jab ramajaan aata to mujhase kaha jaataa ki un "naapak'' dinon main rojaa nahin rakhana he or quran ko nahin choona he
 All these instructions are delivered to the next generations without thinking
 nizamuddin auliya yaa ajmer sharif dargah jaise sufi makbaron par jane ke samay mujhe us bhitari garbh grih main jane kii ijaajat nahin hoti thi, jahaan mard aazaadee se aa-ja sakate the
 That was my second visit to Hazratbal in Srinagar, when something went wrong
 andar jane se jab mujhe roak diya gaya to mujhe kaaphi gussa aa gaya
 Similarly, in Madina, i was not ready for this when i was asked to go to the outer line, which was far from the Prophet's tomb and the men were allowed to go very close

 vahiin bank 20 july tak puraane note arabiai main jamaa karvaa sakate hai
 What was the deadline? On 8 November 2016, when the government announced demonetisation, the deadline was fixed for depositing the banned currency in the bank till 30 December 2016

 naa jane kitne hi log aise the, jo lambii linon ke kaaran bainkon tak gaye nahin
 If you are one of them and you still have 500 or 1,000 old notes, then there is good news for you

 In one petition, the petitioner said that he was 66
 80 lakh rupye kii rakam bank main kevaisi nahin hone se jamaa nahin kara sakaa he
