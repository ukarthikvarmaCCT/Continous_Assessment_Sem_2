 Sanjay Dutt, emotional after watching "sanju", kept crying for 20 minutes, did Sanjay take steroids to build his body? When he was asked if he had taken steroids to make a body? The actor replied, "there was nothing like steroids in those days
" sab kuch diet hoti thi
 Then came protein powder and now steroids

 So they started saying that its body is good and it is possible only when you take drugs
 ''aspataal main smoking karne kaa pachhtaawaa- sanjayma naragis ke hospital rum main smoke karne par sanjay dutt ne kaha, ''main is baat ke liye khud ko saalon tak maaf nahin kar paaya

 '' Two people in my life who are not only incredible women but undoubtedly, the best mothers too
 Always thankful to God for blessing me with such an amazing & loving family
 # mothersdaya post shared bysanjay Dutt (@duttsanjay) onmay 12, 2018 at 11:39 pm PDT Sanjay said - no one will spend 25-30 crore rupees to change the image, weeping for 20 minutes after watching 'sanju' - Sanjay said, ' 'it was difficult for me to see my journey again through a movie
 maine kaaphi der tak apane imoshan ko control kiya
 i couldn't resist when the movie was over
 main bahut royaa
 i could not believe that this is my biopic
 main film khatm hone ke baad vidhu vinod chopra or rajkumaar hiraani ke gale lagakar 20 minute tak khub royaa
 "what was in those tapes sent from India, which changed the life of Sanju, will not cost any 30-40 crores for the image makeover," said Sanjay Dutt, who also said that Rajkumar Hirani changed his image Made Sanju for sanjay dutt ne kaha ki ''koi kisi kii chhavi badalane ke liye 30-40 karod rupye kharch nahin karegaa

 ' vaishvik credit reating agency 'mudies invester sarvice' kaa maananaa he ki khaadya sabsidi or vitaran main sujhaaye gaye sudhaarwadi kadamon se bharat main mahangaai or vittiya ghaataa kam hoga
 On 21 January, a central government committee suggested reformist steps in the food subsidy and distribution system
 'mudies credit outluk' ke taaja ank main mudies kii sahyogi vishleshak 'sovrain risk samooh' ne kaha, hamen nitiyon main turant sudhaar kii ummid he, jisase desh kii khaadya aapurti shrunkhlaa kii kshamta main sudhaar hoga or mahangaai dar va sarkaar ke vittiya ghate main kami aegi
 These reformist steps include decentralization of grain purchases
 is prakriya main adhik khaadya anaaj kaa nipataara, pratyaksh nakad hastantaran ke jariye khaadya or urvarak sabsidi kii supurdagee or khaadya sabsidi kam kii jaati he
 Under the National Food Security Act, the benefit of food subsidy is to be reduced from 67 percent to 40 percent of the population
 mudies ke anusaar khaadya mahangaai kii vajah se bharat kii upabhokta keemat suchakank (sipiai) mahangaai dar pichley paanch saalon main ausat nau pratishat rahi he
 According to Moody's, the loss of grain stocks through inefficiency and corruption has increased costs and reduced the socio-economic benefits of the distribution system
 agency ke anusaar vyapak paardarshita or kshamta hone se maang or aapurti donon badhegi, jisase teji se keemat suchakon par asar padegaa
 At the same time, those reasons which are responsible for increasing food prices in India than the world will be reduced
 march 2014 ko samaapt hue vitt varsh main bharat kaa saamaanya sarkari ghaataa anupaat sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) kaa 7

 Food subsidy reduction is a politically sensitive issue in India
 vitt varsh 2014 main bharat kii vaarshik prati vyakti aay 1,509 dollar rahi he
 It may therefore be difficult to get parliamentary approval to amend the National Food Security Act and decrease the population entitled to get food subsidies

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter america raashtrapati baraak obama ne ek videshi netaa ke madhyam se iran ke sarvocch netaa ayatulla ali khameni ko bheje ek gupt sandesh main sanket diya he ki iran asainya parmaanu kaarykram chalaa saktaa he, basharte ki vah parmaanu hathiyaar kabhi na banaae
 This information has been revealed in a media report
 samachar patr washington post ke anusaar, 'raashtrapati obama ne iran ko sanket diya he ki america tehran ke asainya parmaanu kaarykram ko sweekaar kar legaa, basharte ki sarvocch netaa ali khameni haal main kiye apane us saarvajanik daawey par atal bane rahen ki unka desh kabhi bhi parmaanu hathiyaar nahin banayega
 'khamenei recently said,' Iran has never made or will ever make nuclear weapons
 iran parmaanu hathiyaar nahin chahta, kyonki yah islamic ganraajya taarkik rup se, dharmik rup se or saidhantik rup se parmaanu hathiyaar jamaa karne ko bhayanak paap maanata he or is tarah ke hathiyaaron ke prasar ko moorkhtapurna, vinaashkari or khatarnaak maanata he
 The newspaper has said that this verbal message to Khamenei was sent through Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had recently met Obama and later visited Tehran
 report main kaha gaya he, 'tehran kii yatra se kuch dinon pehle eradogan ne obama se tseol main ek ghante mulaakaat kii thi, or us dauraan donon netaaon ne us sandesh par charchaa kii thi, jise eradogan ko parmaanu va syria sambandhi mudde par ayatulla se kahana tha
 "the report said that during the meeting Obama told Erdogan that Iran should understand that the time for a peaceful solution is fast approaching, so it should take advantage of the current avenues for dialogue
" report ke anusaar, lekin obama ne yah spasht nahin kiya ki kya iran ko gharelu str par uranium samvardhan kii anumati hogi yaa nahin
 Thus, this sensitive issue will obviously be left for the forthcoming talks between Iran and six other countries
 report main kaha gaya he ki aisa mana jaataa he ki eradogan ne iran main khameni se apni mulaakaat ke dauraan obama ke is sandesh se unhen avgat kara diya he
 Russia, China, the United States, Britain, France, and Germany will discuss Iran's disputed nuclear program with Istanbul on April 13–14, according to Xinhua

 This is the reason why Diya Kumari made it clear that the resentment of the Rajputs has been rectified
 unka maananaa he ki rajput samaaj shuru se bijepi ke saath rahaa he or bijepi ke saath hi rahegaa
 Diya said that 'there is a lot of respect for the Rajwada in Rajasthan in the mind of the general public, due to which she wins whenever she goes to the polls
 ' apana anubhav saajha karte hue kaha ki 'jaipur kaa rajvada janata ke liye kaaphi bhalaai kaa kaam kiya he yahi vajah he ki pehali baar jab vah rajmahal se janata ke bich pahunchin to logon ne itnaa pyaar diya ki apana ghar jaisaa laga

 The Right to Information Act (RTI), which has become a weapon for the common man to expose the truth, was implemented in the country six years ago, then few people would have known its strength
 aaj isaki madad se 2ji spectrum, adarsh sosayadi or lavasa city jaise dheron bade ghotaale ujagar hue hai
 State Chief Information Commissioner Padmapani Tiwari says, "after independence, no law has had as much impact as RTI
 isse bhrashtachar ke maamle to ujagar ho hi rahe hai, javabdehi bhi badi he
 Due to this fear, the central government is also preparing to limit its scope
 duusare rajyon ke saath pradesh main bhi 12 aktubar, 2005 ko, sarkaar or sarkari mashinari ko janata ke prati javabdeh banane or lok praadhikariyon ke kaamkaaj main paardarshita laane ke liye, artiai adhinium lagu kiya gaya tha
 But the truth is that even today information from government machinery is not easily available
 lokayukta or police kii aarthik aparaadh anusandhan shakha ko iske daayre se baahar karne kaa faisla bhi ise kamjor banaata he
 However, the government has received notice on a petition filed against this decision in the Madhya Pradesh High Court on 24 September
 marijon par, unki sahmati ke bagaiyr, avaidhanik rup se dawaaon kaa pareekshan (drug trial) karne kaa maamla ujagar karne vaale indore ke dow

 unhone aarthik aparaadh shakha (iodblyoo) se drug trial maamle kii jaanch report artiai ke tahat maangi thi, jo satyaapan ke adheen bataate hue nahin di gai jabaki satyaapan pehle hi ho chukaa tha
 Gautam Kothari, a chartered accountant, industrialist and president of Pithampur Industrial Organization, who is also an RTI activist, says, "the purpose of stopping the information is also to delay because in such cases the information has to be appealed to the Commission and let go until it is resolved
" The year is delayed
 isse artiai kanoon kii dhar kund ho jaati he
 On the question of delay in giving information, Tiwari says, "information officers were not given the kind of training they should get
 unhen kanoon or uski prakriya kii jaankaree bhi nahin he
 Kothari had asked for documents and claims related to the establishment of a medical university in the state
 jawaab mila ki mantrimandal ko faisla lenaa he jiske liye dastavej jaruri hai, isliye jaankaree nahin di ja sakati
 In fact, the original documents were necessary for taking the decision while their true copy was sought under RTI

 "the petitioner's money is being spent in making the appeal, but the Public Information Officer receives no punishment," says Kothari
 ''deree kaa kaaran ayog main staff kii kami bhi he
 Says Bhopal's RTI activist Ajay Dubey, "the state government has weakened the law

 As per the information given in the Legislative Assembly, as of February 10, 2011, a total of 4,765 appeals were pending
 2010 main ayog ko 3,548 apilen kii gayi jinamein se sabase zyada 953 panchayat evam gramin vikaas vibhaag se sambandhit thim

 The number of appeals made in the Commission on the non-submission or incomplete information of the Department of Higher Education were 158 and the number of appeals related to the Department of School Education was 155
 kothaari kehete hai, ''pratham apiliy adhikari kii jimmedaari tay nahin hone se us par koi aanch nahin aati
 Therefore, there is no resolution at this stage and the number of appeals with the Commission increases
 ''lok soochna adhikariyon or apiliy adhikariyon ko sajaa kaa dar na hona bhi unke is ravaie kaa kaaran he
 Dubey had sought information from the Panchayat and Rural Development Department about the irregularities in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme on July 12, 2010, which was not given to him
 dube ne apiliy adhikari ke saamne bhi guhaar lagaai lekin duusari apil ke liye aakhirkaar unhen rajya soochna ayog kaa darwaja hi khatkhataana padaa
 a year later, on August 9, 2011, a hearing was held in the Commission, in which the Public Information Officer of the Panchayat and Rural Development Department was directed to present the original records related to the information required within 15 days, but even after one month of this period, the records While not presented, the Commission's decision is final and binding
 dube kehete hai, ''ayog ke nirdesh hawa main uda die gaye
 The commission does not have the power to hear a contempt case
 adhikariyon ne niyamon kii aad lekar kanoon ko laachaar bana diya he
 '' However, the commission has Rs 25,000

 But the information given in the Assembly shows that in 2010 only one officer was fined

 "tiwari clarifies this," the commission is not a revenue-collecting department, so the penalty is not insisted upon

 Public Information Officer is discouraged from giving penalty notice
 '' dow
 Rai draws attention to another aspect, "in 80% of the cases, information is not received on time and hence it is given free of cost
 iskaa boj sarkari khajaane par pad rahaa he lekin phir bhi kisi kii jimmedaari tay nahin
 On hiding the information, this fact should be recorded in the confidential report of the Public Information Officer

 There are also complaints of misuse of the RTI Act

 "it is very important to stop misuse of the law," says Tiwari
 '' dube isse sahmati jataate hue suzav dete hai, ''vidhansabha main uthaae gaye sawaalon kii tarah isamen chaahi gai jaankaree or sambandhit aavednon ko saarvajanik karnaa chahie, isse blakemeling kii shikayaton main kami aegi
 Even if blackmailers do not get the information, they write in front of the commission and give the information
 '' artiai kaaryakarta kehete hai ki artiai aavednon kii vibhagavar samiksha honi chahie, isaki bhi masik yaa salanaa report taiyaar kii jaani chahie
 In the absence of widespread publicity, especially in rural areas, there is a lack of awareness about this law
 dube kehete hai, ''ise schuli shiksha ke paathyakram main shaamil karnaa chahie
 "at the same time, Kothari says," If the system of giving RTI application and information is online, then people's participation will increase

 'SSP Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj told,' Suspected accused Ashok Kumar Pandey is being questioned in custody

 Since the investigation is still going on, it would not be appropriate to disclose more facts in such a situation

 If India wants to negotiate it, we are ready for it

 The policy of Pakistan with a new approach is also clear

 During this time Pakistan did not even get news of India's action
 jab bhartiya ladaaku vimaan miraj oparation ko anjaam dene ke baad waapas laut aae, tab jaakar pakistan ko isaki jaankaree mili
 After this, Pakistan went mad and launched an aerial attack on the Indian territory, which the Indian Army retaliated
 bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan ke ladaaku vimaan F-16 ko bhi maar giraaya
 During this time the Indian Air Force fighter aircraft mig-21 also fell and Wing Commander Abhinandan reached the area occupied by present Pakistan

 In order to compensate the loss from the growing alliance of regional parties in North India, the BJP will strengthen the scope of the National Democratic Alliance in the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra and bring together the powerful parties of the states besides the Congress-led scattered grand alliance
 Has started working hard partiyon ko pataa he ki zyada vot se badi jeet jaruri he or badi jeet gathbandhan main shaamil partiyon kii sankhya par nirbhar karegi
 Statistics show that getting more votes is not always a guarantee of seat and this vote percentage and the equation of the seat makes the politics of coalition away
 1999 se lekar 20014 tak ke chunaavon main mukhyataur par teen gathbandhan bane
 The same coalition reached power which compromised the most parties
 1999 main NDA ne 19 partiyon ke saath gathbandhan kiya jabaki congress ke netritv vaali upie gathbandhan 11 partiyon ko lekar chunaav main utari thi
 NDA formed the government under the leadership of BJP
 uske baad 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main endie ke paas 1999 se 7 kam partiyaan thim, jabaki upie 20 partiyon ke gathbandhan ke saath chunaav maidan main utraa
 This time the UPA formed the government at the Center
 2009 main bhi upie ke paas endie se do partiyaan adhik thim, upar se mulaayam singh or basapa ne bina maange upie sarkaar kaa samarthan kar diya
 The third front, the third front, was disintegrated by 2014
 2014 main phir se endie ne upie ke mukaable zyada partiyon ko joda
 Compared to 2009, with 8 parties joining the alliance, it contested with 18 parties and won 336 seats and formed the government
 gathbandhan loktantr ke jhukaav par kaise haaavee hota he iskaa sabase sidhaa udhaaharan dekhie
 In the 2014 elections in Bihar, JDU was able to win only two seats in the Lok Sabha with 16 per cent votes while Ram Vilas Paswan's party managed to win 6 seats with just six and a half per cent votes
 yah dikhaata he ki chunaav main partiyon kii hawa se zyada jeetne laayak gathbandhan hona jaruri he
 The smaller parties, which are the allies of the coalition government, may not have reached the Parliament in large numbers, but a fixed vote bank has given more benefit to the larger party in other areas
 1999 main baari bharkam jeet ke baavjood atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar 2004 main haar gai
 Along with the failure of the India Shining campaign, the big reason was the exit of seven smaller parties from the alliance
 1999 kii 182 siton vaali bijepi ko 2004 main mahaj 138 seat hasil huin
 The BJP has learned from the setbacks in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections and has moved ahead from 2014 to further expand the alliance in 2019
 haalanki upi main mayawati kii bispi or akhilesh yadav kii samaajawaadee party ke ek saath aane se upi main usko bade jatke ke asaar hai
 In 2004, the SP and BSP held the BJP to only 10 out of 80 seats
 basapa ko 2004 main 19 or sapa ko 35 seat mili thim
 Now, when the two powerful parties are together, it is going to be a difficult situation for the BJP even more than 2004
 bihar main lalu yadav or congress ke mahagathbandhan ke saath endie se jude puraane netaaon khaskar upendra kushvaha or jeethanram maanjhi ke aane se bhi bijepi or nitish kumaar ke liye chunauti badi ho gai
 In 2004, the rjd-led Congress and Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party won 29 seats out of 40
 bijepi or janata dal united ko keval 11 seat mili thim
 Things have changed in 2019
 paswan endie ke saath hai lekin endie ke purv sahyogi upendra kushvaha or jithan maanjhi upie kaa hissaa ban chuke hai
 The BJP has announced a re-alliance with the Shiv Sena in the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra to make up for the potential loss in these seats
 congress ne bhi sharad pavaar ko saath lekar utarane kaa faisla kiya he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, NDA won one seat due to alliance with PMK and MDMK while AIADMK won 37 out of 39 seats
 ab 2019 main bijepi ko lagata he ki kisi bhi tarah se ediemke ko is baar saath lenaa chahie
 Although the AIADMK has been part of the bjp-led NDA in 2004 as well
 2004 ke kul 12 dalon ke endie gathbandhan main ediemke ekmaatr party thi jo ek bhi seat nahin jeet pai thi
 The seats in the UPA alliance with the DMK and smaller parties in Tamil Nadu are being decided at the most
 congress tamilnadu main 9 siton par or diemke 25 siton par chunaav lard sakati he
 The UPA is considering giving five seats to other smaller parties
 maharashtra main endie ke binar tale shivasena or bijepi phir se saath aa chuke hai
 BJP is going to contest 25 and Shiv Sena 23 seats
 is gathjod ke jawaab main congress or rashtravaadi congress party yani ensipi ne haath milaayaa he
 The Congress and NCP also came together in 2004 after a poor 1999 performance
 2004 main donon partiyon ne maharashtra kii 23 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 The 2019 election will be named after the regional parties
 gathbandhan ke netritv vaali badi partiyaan inke bharose hi badi jeet hasil karne kii ranneeti bana rahi hai
 Politically, this environment is almost like 2004, where after 1999 the opposition, especially the UPA, was eager to somehow keep the NDA out of power
 bihar ke ek filmkaar ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke vikaas ke agenda or bharat ko badalane kii unki drushti par ek film banaai he
 Filmmaker and co-director Suresh Jha said that the shooting of the 2-hour and 15-minute film 'modi's village' has been completed and is in the post-production phase
 film kuch maheene ke bheetar cinemagharon main hit hone kii ummid he
 Jha said that it is not a biopic, its mega premiere is planned
 mumbai ke vyapaaree or modi ke hamshakl vikaas mahante ne film main modi kii bhoomika nibhaai he
 In this medium budget film, television actor Chandramani M

 Jha said, 'in America, he understood Modi's vision of his work and dreams of developing the nation
 vah isse prerit hokar waapas lauti, jis par film bani
 He told that the film was shot in Patna, Darbhanga and Mumbai
 jha ne bataaya ki 'modi kaa gaanv' main sangeetkaar manojanand choudhary ne saat geet die hai

 Talking about the 2008 elections, Purushottam Dangi of Congress defeated Badrilal Yadav of BJP
 purushotham dangi ko 51950 vot mili the to vahiin badarilaal yadav ko 38506 vot mili the
 Talking about the issues, there is a lack of basic facilities in this area
 iske alaava peyajal sankat se bhi yahaan ke log jujh rahe hai
 Education and health facilities are in bad shape here
 yahaan ke aspataalon main doctoron or sansaadhan kii kami he
 The youth here have to go to other cities for higher education

 These names have been repeated so many times in the last two years that they have become the identity of the Modi government
 lekin mumbai main mek in india ke bhavy kaarykram main aagjanee ke kuch din baad jab 29 farvari ko dilli main vitt mantri arun jetali ne bajet pesh kiya, to aisa laga, jaise in khanakdaar shabdon kii rangath ud gai ho
 Jaitley was presenting the budget of the Modi government, but was showing generosity towards the schemes which once used to be the predecessor of the previous Manmohan Singh government
 modi sarkaar kii pasandida 13 yojanaon ko agar jetali ne apane bajet se kareeb 40,000 karod ru
 If allocated, only one lakh crore rupees were given to the six schemes which were under water in Manmohan's time
 se adhik kii rakam de di
 It will probably be a rare occasion that a government is relying so much on old schemes in return for its beloved schemes
 ise endie sarkaar kii aaazadkhyali ke taur par bhi dekha ja saktaa he or uski apni yojanaon ke janata ke bich kam lokapriy hone ke taur par bhi

 The need was stated
 lekin bajet aavanton sab anumaanon se kam rahaa
 In this way, this scheme will be able to bring barely five percent additional farmers, 23 percent of the farmers in the country are currently under insurance
 haalanki krishi mantri radhamohan singh aavanton ko paryaapt maanate hai
 He says, "there is no shortage of money, as much will be required

 “similarly, the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Vikas Yojana was created this year with an aim to irrigate the remaining 65 per cent of the unirrigated land in the country

 On the other hand, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), which became a symbol of scams at the time of the Manmohan government, was converted into a National Health Mission (NHM) by the Modi government for Rs 20,000 crore

 The government has made a significant allocation by removing the names of Atal or Deen Dayal Upadhyay from schemes run in the name of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi

 That black money will cost more than 1000 tons of gold
 ise shobhan sarkaar ke sapane ke makhul ke taur par dekha gaya narendra modi ne apane twit main ab shobhan sarkaar kii tarif kii he
 According to Modi, reverence of Sant Shobhan Sarkar has been attached to millions of people for many years
 unhone kaha ki main unki tapasya or tyaag ko pranaam karata hum
 In fact, when Narendra Modi made fun of the excavation going on on Baba's dream, the Shobhan Sarkar wrote a letter and posed tough questions to Narendra Modi

 PM Modi made a big statement about Akash Vijayvargiya at the BJP Parliamentary Party meeting on Tuesday
 unhone naaraazgi jataate hue kaha tha ki kisi kaa betaa ho, party se nikaal dena chahie

 Tiana Gia Johnson came into this world like a force of nature and Mama @laurenhashianofficial labored and delivered like a true rockstar
 i was raised and surrounded by strong, loving women all my life, but after participating in baby Tia’s delivery, it’s hard to express the new level of love, respect and admiration i have for @laurenhashianofficial and all mamas and women out there
 Word to the wise gentlemen, it's critical to be by your lady's head when she's delivering, being as supportive as you can
 
 holding hands, holding legs, whatever you can do
 But, if you really want to understand the single most powerful and primal moment life will ever offer - watch your child being born
 Its a life changer and the respect and admiration you have for a woman, will forever be boundless
 And to my third and youngest daughter, Tiana Gia - like i did when your two older sisters Simone Alexandra and Jasmine Lia were born, you have my word, I’ll love, protect, guide and make ya laugh for the rest of my life
 Your crazy dad has many responsibilities and wears many hats in this big ol 'world, but being your dad will always be the one I'm most proud to wear
 Oh and one more thing
 
 you’re gonna love rollin’ in daddy’s pick up truck

 purv pradhanmantriatal bihari vaajapeyi ko desh kaa sarvocch naagarik sammaan 'bharat ratna' dene kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 But in view of his health, there is a question that whether he himself will go to Rashtrapati Bhavan to get the honor or some other way will be found
 gauratlab he ki atal bihari vaajapeyi lambey samay se aswasth hai or ghar se baahar nahin nikalate
 Now very few people get a chance to meet them
 kai varshon se vah kisi saarvajanik manch par najar nahin aae
 It is said that now he spends most of his time in a wheelchair and does not recognize people
 unke bare main jo khabaren aati hai, ve bhi sutron ke hawaale se hi aati hai
 See: The special offer till date, 'atal' song, seems unlikely to come to Rashtrapati Bhavan to receive the honor
 haalanki yah sambhav he ki raashtrapati ke pratinidhi adhikari swayan unke ghar pahunchakar unhen sammaan den
 This has happened before also
 pandit bhimsen joshi ko saal 2008 main isi tarah bharat ratna diya tha
 a team of officers reached his residence in Pune and honored him
 abhinayta praan ko bhi dada sahab phalke puraskaar dene tatkaaleen soochna-prasaaran mantri manish tiwari unke ghar pahunch gaye the
 There is also a possibility that the representative of Atal, on behalf of Atal, will reach the Rashtrapati Bhavan to receive this honor
 aise main unki dattak putree namita bhattacharya yaa unke damaad ranjan bhattacharya raashtrapati bhawan kii anumati se yah sammaan lene pahunch sakate hai
 But this usually happens only when the person deserving the award has died
 atal ko routine jaanch ke liye unhen chupchaap ames le jaaya jaataa he
 During this time no one is allowed to take a picture
 bataaya jaataa he ki baad ke dinon main unke ghar aane kii ijaajat bhi chuninda logon ko rahi he
 These include NM Ghantale, Lal Krishna Advani, BC Khanduri etc
 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh bhi unke janmdin par shubhakamanaayen dene or kushal kshem poochne unke ghar jate hai
 The current home minister Rajnath Singh posted a picture of him on Facebook last year, which is said to be a few years old
 iske baad se unki koi tasviir saamne nahin ai he
 If he goes to Rashtrapati Bhavan to take the honor or the officials reach his house, people will see the latest pictures of him after a long time
 lekin agar atal kii ore se unke rishtedaar yaa kisi or pratinidhi ne yah sammaan liya to hansmukh vyaktitv ke is lokapriy rajaneta ko dekhne kaa yah mauka bhi jaataa rahegaa

 BJP has strongly objected to Salman Khurshid calling Narendra Modi 'impotent'
 bhartiya janata yuva morcha ke adhyaksh anuraag thakur ne khurshid ke bayaan kii ninda karte hue congress ko hi 'napunsak' qaraar diya
 He said that the Congress Party, which has repeatedly introduced impotence, should first look into its fold

 i want to ask Salman Khurshid whether he had introduced his impotence to the country by making this statement and did he not insult Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma who was martyred in the Delhi Police Batla House encounter? Khurshid's wife in the Vidhan Sabha of Uttar Pradesh It was Khurshid's strength that was badly defeated in the elections and came in at number five

In sharm-el-sheikh, the Prime Minister's joint statement with the Pakistani Prime Minister, in which Pakistan made fabricated allegations against India on the Balochistan case, was not the result of impotence of the Congress government? Pakistani Prime Minister calls India's Prime Minister a rustic woman , The Italian government refuses to send the sailors facing their case back to India and the situation has become so bad that the Supreme t had refused to leave India to intervene Italian diplomat, he went to Italy has agreed to send their sailors back

And does it not show his impotence?

 modi ke baad china kii policy2014 main narendra modi ne jab piem pad kii shapath lee thi, tab se hi ve china kii ore kaaphi aakarshak rahe hai
 In September 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping was called to India by PM Modi, and swung in Ahmedabad
 tab kaha gaya ki piem china ko nivesh ke liye lubhaana chaahate hai, lekin modi kii america ke saath najdiki dekh china kaa rukh badla
 China repeatedly betrayed India by infiltrating its troops along the border
 haalanki modi sarkaar lagaataar hi is mudde par baatcheet kii baat karti rahi
 What is the role of Doval? Ajit Doval is close to Narendra Modi and quite reliable too
 yahi kaaran he ki piem china ke mudde ko puri tarah se dobhaal ke hawaale kar rakhaa he
 Ajit Doval is always active if there is any talk on the issue of China
 haal hi main doklam ko lekar jo vivaad chal rahaa he, us dauraan bhi dobhaal kii bhoomika kaaphi sakriy rahi
 It is being said that Doval is keeping an eye

 It was the 19th conversation on the border dispute

 For this, the 20th meeting between the two countries will be in India
 donon deshon ne milakar seemaa vivaad sulajhane ke liye gathit vishesh samiti kii he, jiske jariye vivaad ko suljhaayaa ja sake
 Ajit Doval is a key member in this committee
 dobhaal se kyon dar rahaa china?china kaa ajit dobhaal se darana lajimi he
 Doval is the trustee of PM Modi, he has given full responsibility to deal with big cases like china-pakistan
 dobhaal ke enese banane ke baad suraksha niti par bharat kaa rukh aakraamak hua he
 Whether it is a surgical strike on Pakistan, or killing terrorists by entering Myanmar
 china ke mudde par bhi bharat is baar aakraamak rukh banaae hue he or jhukne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Doval has a history of alarm bells for China
 Actually, Ajit Doval has been one of India's best spies
 khufia agency ro ke under cover agent ke taur par dobhaal 6 saal tak pakistan ke lahore main ek pakistani muslim ban kar rahe the
 Apart from this, Ajit Doval, who was established as a fast-tracked intelligence officer in the year 2005, retired as Director of Intelligence Bureau

 During this time he also kept writing articles in the news paper
 saal 1989 main ajit dobhaal ne amritsar ke swarna mandir se charampanthiyon ko nikaalane ke liye 'aaparishan blike thunder' kaa netritv kiya tha
 Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader LK Advani, who is going on a nationwide Rath Yatra against corruption, has said that he is not involved in the race for the post of Prime Minister

 Read: Advani's Rath Yatra may be from October 11 He told reporters about his Rath Yatra that he has full support and blessings of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
 yahaan sangh mukhyalay main sangh ke sar sanghachaalak mohan bhagwat se mulaakaat karne ke baad unhone patrakaron se baatcheet main kaha ki 'vot ke badale note' maamle main hui giraftaareyon ke baad unhone bhrashtachar ke khilaaf deshvyapee yatra karne kaa nirnay liya he or isi silsile main sangh pramukh or party adhyaksh nitin gadakari se mulaakaat karne vah yahaan aae hai
 Read: Advani's charioteer may be Yeddyurappa or Bangaru! He said that he has the full support and blessings of the Sangh for this journey
 yatra ko safal banane ke liye sangh ne apane kaaryakartaaon ko nirdesh bhi die hai
 When asked that you had done many trips before, had you taken blessings from the Sangh even then, he said, 'to make the journey successful, cooperation was taken from those who needed support
 sangh se aksar aupchaarik va anaupchaarik taur par baatcheet hoti rahati he
 Describing the "note for vote" case as the biggest scam of independent India, Advani said, "I was the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha at the time of exposing the 'note for vote' case in Parliament and to expose the matter For i had given permission to my mps, in such a situation, if these former mps are guilty then i am guilty than them
 ’ unhone kaha ki unhen is maamle ko ujagar karne kaa yah tarika uchit laga tha tabhi unhone apane saathiyon ko isaki anumati di thi

 lakhanu police kaa ek inspector jo dekhte hi dekhte chalaa gaya salaakhon ke peeche
 The reason was the Inspector's Love Affair, not from anyone else but his own department's trainee lady Daroga, to get that Inspector weaved a murder plot and took the life of an innocent
 maasoom kii umr mahaj 14 saal kii thi or ye maasoom koi or nahin balki uski premika kaa foophera bhai tha
 The accused inspector on Monday has given a sentence in the District and Sessions Court in Lucknow from where he has been sent to judicial custody for fourteen days
 29 may ko indiranagar ilaake ke faridipur main 14 varshiya chaatr kii hatya kar di gai thi
 The innocent was entered into the house and was gunned down by the killers
 maasoom maaj kii hatya kaa lakhanu police ne khulaasa kiya to khun ke daag khud vardi par hi lag gaye
 The mastermind behind the murder was none other than Inspector Sanjay Rai, who was in charge of Lucknow's Human Trafficking Cell, who got the contract killed
 darasal sanjay raay takreeban do teen saal pehle jab lakhanu ke gajipur thane kaa ingeorge tha, tab ek hatya ke maamle kii tafteesh ke dauraan uski mulaakaat police vibhaag main training kar rahi ek mahila daaroga se hui
 This woman daroga was also named in that murder
 tafteesh ke dauraan sanjay raay ne us mahila pulicekarmi kaa naam is maamle se hataakar uski madad kar di thi, jiske baad mahila daroga or sanjay raay ke bich nazdikiyaan bad gai thi or dono main prem prasang shuru ho gaya
 Everything went well for a few days but in March 2013, there was a dispute between them about something
 is dauraan ek din sanjay ko pataa chalaa ki us mahila daroga kii nazdikyaan akmal naam ke shaks se kaaphi bad gai he or akmal kaa mahila daroga ke ghar main aana-janaa bhi laga rahata he
 Growing up with Akmal with her female friend, Sanjay Rai went through a problem and made a master plan
 is master plan ke mutabik sanjay kaa ye maananaa tha ki agar mahila daroga ke ghar ke parivaar ke kisi bhi shaks kii hatya ho jaye to akmal ko hatya ke maamle main fansaa kar apane raste kaa kanta nikaal saktaa tha
 This was the reason that the inspector gave a supari to the murder of a person in the woman's family and for this Sanjay summoned five mercenaries from Azamgarh and Mau
 shooter jis din is ghatana ko anjaam dene mahila daroga ke ghar pahunche sabase pehle darwaja kholane par maasoom maaj unka shikaar ho gaya
 When the police began investigating the matter after Maj's death, Sanjay Rai tried to implicate Akmal in the murder and spread a rumor in the entire police department that Maaj's killer is Akmal but the police did not blame Akmal in the investigation Found
 14 saal ke maasoom chaatr kii hatya ke baad police bhi hairaan thi
 The biggest question with the police was that what could be the enmity of innocent innocent person and who killed him and why
 lihaaja police nen maamle kii tafteesh shuru kii
 During the investigation, the police found some evidence indicating that some of the shooters in Azamgarh had carried out the murder
 lihaaja police ne do shootaron ko giraftaar kiya
 When the police took out the call details of the shooters, the number of Sanjay Rai was also present in the call detail, after which the police also investigated the call details of Sanjay Rai
 sanjay raay kii kaal detail main shootaron kaa number to maujuud tha hi, saath hi ek or number maujuud tha, jis number par sanjay raay kii sainkadon kaal padi thi
 When the police traced that number, it was found that the number belonged to the lady daroga who was Maj's cousin
 police ko ab maamla kuch-kuch samaj main aane laga tha
 When the police severely questioned the shooters, the shooters unleashed all secrets
 maamla sirf prem prasang kaa tha
 On June 10, the police arrested the shooters
 us din ye khulaasa hua tha ki mastermind sanjay raay he, jiske baad sanjay ko nilambit kar diya gaya tha or police uski talash kar rahi thi kyonki sanjay raay kai thanon kaa prabharee rahaa or lakhanu kii servilans cell kaa bhi prabharee tha, wo police ke hatkandon ko acchhee tareeke se jaanata tha
 The days where Sanjay was absconding, he talked to his Sims only once, and he was constantly changing places
 mahakme ke is inspector ne police kii kaaphi kirakiri kara di
 Therefore, the police was looking for it with great enthusiasm but Sanjay was dodging the police, after which the police had to declare a reward of five thousand on Sanjay, but this police scandal also proved to be a failure
 shuru se aakhir tak police sanjay raay ko talashti rahi or sanjay police ko chakma detaa rahaa
 Sanjay then filed an application for surrender in the court and appeared before the court on Monday, where he was sent to judicial custody for 14 days

 - input IANS ke saath The historic Sinhagad Fort, located in the Sahyadri Hills, about 40 km from Pune city, is 2000 years old
 chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ke bahadur yoddha tanaji malusire ne ise 1670 main dobaaraa apane kabje main lene ke liye jang ladi thi
 Due to the valiant feats of this war, till date this fort has been the subject of discussion among history lovers
 vaise to roj is kile par sailaaniyon kaa tantaa laga rahata he lekin chuttee ke din is kile par bahut bheed hoti he
 The most difficult is to go to the fort via narrow road
 barish ke dinon main oonchi pahari se chote pathar yaa phirmitti kaa khisaknasadak par gaadi chalaanaa mushkil kar detaa he
 Something similar happened on Sunday evening
 pahari se chattan khisakane kaa andeshaa kile kii is sadak par gasht kar rahe security gord ko hua
 The deep moat on one side and the high flight on the other, as debris began to slide, prevented tourists from going to the road from both ends
 palak jhapakate hi pehle badi si chattan khiski or phir bade-bade pattharon ke saath mitti kaa malba sadak par aa gira
 Thankfully no one got hit by this landslide because of not having anyone
 agle teen se chaar ghante main malba hataane ke baad pahari par fanse sailaani neeche aa sake
 Now the tourists are not allowed to visit Sinhagad Fort for the next week
 saat se aath dinon main pahari par jane vaali sadak ke kinare vaale chattaanon se us hisse ko nikaalane kaa kaam hoga jahaan bhuskhalan kii sambhaavna he
 The 'cock Fight' is very interesting to watch
 gaanv kasbon main abhi yah manoranjan kaa hissaa he
 But a special type of 'cock fight' is organized in the markets and fairs of Jharkhand
 kai ilaakon main pratiyogita yojit hoti he
 Cock is not only specially trained for fighting, but special attention is also given to its diet
 jharkhand ke lohardaga, gumla, purvi singhbhum, pashchimi singhbhum, simdega sahit kai jilon main is ladaai ko adivaasiyon kii samskruti se jodakar dekha jaataa he
 The cock market is put up in many areas for cock fighting
 itihaas ke pannon main murga ladaai kii koi pramanik jaankaree to nahin milti, lekin adivasee samaaj main murga ladaai kai pidiyon se aam jindagi kaa manorank hissaa bana hua he
 Cock fighting expert Ashok Singh says that cock fighting used to be a part of entertainment in the past where people would also place bets on the rooster of their choice
 ab is ladaai ke naam par jua shuru ho gaya he
 The identity of tribal culture is being lost due to this fight
 apane mughare ko ladaai ke liye taiyaar kar rahe gumla ke avadhesh bhagat bataate hai ki ladaai main prashikshit murge utaare jate hai
 One leg of the chicken ready to fight is tied with a good English U-shaped weapon called 'katthi'
 aisa nahin yah katthi koi vyakti baandh saktaa he
 There is also the art of tying it
 katathi baandhne waalon ko katkir kaha jaataa he jo is kala ke maahir hote hai
 After tying the string, the chickens get ready for battle
 jab do murge ladaai ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai to darshak ke rup main upasthit log apane manapsand murge par daanv lagaate hai
 The chicken fight usually lasts 10 minutes
 is dauraan murge ko utsahit karne ke liye murgabaz (murga kaa maalik) tarah-tarah kaa aawaaj nikaalata rahata he, jiske bad murga or khatarnaak ho jaataa he
 The chickens keep attacking each other with each other
 is dauraan murga lahuluhan ho jaataa he
 On many occasions, it is cut from the neck to the hen's neck
 murgo kii ladaai tabhi samaapt hoti he jab ek murga ghayal ho jaae yaa maidan chhodkar bhaag jaae
 Another cocktail said that to prepare the chicken specially, he is given nutritious food, sometimes such chickens are also fed meat
 ladaaku banane ke liye murgo ko naa keval maadaa murge se dur rakhaa jaataa he, balki use kai dinon tak andhere main bhi rakhaa jaataa he
 Rakesh Kumar Sinha, journalist of Lohardaga, says that Murga Bazaar is an integral part of the culture of tribal society
 purv main iskaa aayojan manoranjan ke liye kiya jaataa tha, parantu ab dhanalolup logon ne adivaasiyon kii is gauravshaalee parampara ko vikrut kar diya he
 Today the Rooster market has become a den of gambling, speculation and liquor
 tanushri datta kenaana patekarpar chhedchhad ke aarope lagane ke baad bollywood main casting couch or shaareerik shoshan kaa maamla ek baar phir uth gaya he
 The stars are also giving their different opinions on this
 kajolka kahana he ki ye hakeekat he, lekin unhone kabhi ise apane saamne nahin dekha
 Only heard the rumor
 kisi ne abhi tak ise sweekaar bhi nahin kiya ki usne ye sab kiya he
 Kajol told NDTV during the promotion of her film Helicopter Eela, "I have heard a lot about the casting couch, but never encountered it in the industry
" ye sab chintajanak he
 It is sad that Katnushriko had to go through all this
 yadi ye sab mere saamne hota to jarur khadi hoti yaa kuch karti
 "let me tell you that Tanushree told the truth of Bollywood," Whether the scene is needed or not, the intimate scene is kept
 ye apni tharak nikaalane kaa said tarika hota he
 If someone wants to molest the film shooting under the guise of work, then the simple director-producer has to go and tell me to put my intimate scene with it whether it is needed or not
 ye main samaj gai thi
 "what is the whole matter? Tanushree has accused Nana Patekar of profanity and molestation during the shooting
" unhone 2008 main ek film kii shooting ke dauraan naanaa par apane saath jor jabardastee kii koshish kaa aarope lagaaya
 He had said, "nana Patekar wanted to forcibly get closer, he was not a part of the song during the shooting, though he tried to get intimate with him
" chhattisgarh main ucch stareey pramanikaran chaanbin samiti ne purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi ke kanvar adivasee hone ke pramaan patr ko khaarij kar diya he
 In this way Ajit Jogi is no longer a tribal
 is faisle ke baad jogi kii mushkilen bad sakati hai or unki vidhayaki par bhi sankat ke badal mandaraane lage hai
 This is the reason why Ajit Jogi has decided to challenge this order in the High Court
 bataa den ki 2011 main supreme court ne chhattisgarh kii tatkaaleen raman singh sarkaar ko purv iees adhikari jogi kii jati kaa pataa lagane ke liye ek cameti gathit karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 In its investigation in June 2017, the committee did not consider Jogi to be tribal
 iske khilaaf jogi hai court pahunch gaye
 In 2018, the Chhattisgarh High Court formed the High Powered Scrutiny Committee for the second time
 ab duusari baar gathit kii gai ucchdhikaar scrootni cameti ne yah bhi saaf kar diya he ki ab jogi ke liye anusuchit jati ke laabh kii paatrata nahin hogi
 The report is being seen as a major setback for the former CM, as it is sure to have an impact on the caste certificate as well as his political future
 jogi philhal marvaahee seat se vidhayak hai or yah seat anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit he
 After Jogi rejected the Scheduled Caste certificate, it is now believed that this Marwahi seat can also go through his hand
 marvaahee seat anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit he, jiske chalate ajit jogi ne is seat ko apana majboot garh banaaya
 This is the reason that from 2001 onwards, this assembly seat remained as a Jogi
 2003 or 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav main ajit jogi lagaataar yahaan se vidhayak rahe
 In 2013, Amit Jogi left this seat
 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaav main ajit jogi ne ek baar phir marvaahee seat se chunavi maidan main utre or congress kii lahar ke baavjood 46 hajaar 462 vot se jeetne main safal rahe
 But now after Jogi's tribal caste certificate is rejected, questions can be raised on his Marwahi seat and in this way his legislature can also be snatched away
 ajit jogi ne patrakaron ne kaha ki yah nirnay bhupesh baghel ucch stareey chaanbin samiti kaa nirnay he
 Jogi said that the case was not raised against him when he was an Indian Administrative Service officer
 raajnneeti main aane ke baad yah maamla saamne aayaa
 When he was elected to the Rajya Sabha, his caste issue came up before the Indore Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court
 unke paksh main indore, jabalpur tathaa bilaspur ucch nyaayalay se chah baar faisle aae hai
 He said that the report came twice during the tenure of the Raman Singh government
 main tab se ab tak nyaayalay main in faislon ko chunauti detaa rahaa hum or ab pun: main is maamle ko ucch nyaayalay or ucchtam nyaayalay tak chunauti duungaa
 Please tell that this case against Jogi has been going on for the last two decades

 Mistakes of the administration and the railways that left more than 60 dead bodies on the track 1 - The administration should not have allowed to burn Ravana in a place where the crowd could come to the railway track
 2- agar prashasan ne anumati de bhi di to yah sunishchit kiya janaa chahie tha ki log trek par yaa uske aasapaas na khadey hon
 3- There should have been deployment of police or committee people around the track so that if a train comes, then people present about it can be informed
 4- prashasan or aayojan samiti ko pehle se yah chetavanee jari kerani chahie thi ki is samay yahaan har roj train aati he, sajag rahen
 5- After the accident, the injured should have got immediate help
 samiti ke logon ko jimmedaari se nahin bhaagna chahie tha

 'train par ravan savaar tha'1- railway ko pataa hona chahie tha ki is trek ke aasapaas har saal ravan dahan kaa kaarykram hota he
 2- During this time, the railways should have made adequate arrangements to control the speed of the train
 3- trek ke paas or trek par itani bheed ko driver nahin dekh paaya, use immergency brake lagaana chahie tha
 4- The high officials of the railway should have known immediately which train caused the accident
 5- railway ko fouran helpline number jari karnaa chahie tha jisase logon ko apane logon ke bare main jaankaree mil paati

 Before the assembly elections in Rajasthan, a decision of the state Keevsundhara Rajasarkar became the subject of discussion
 bijepisarkaar ne ek aadesh jari kiya ki aane vaali 5 sitambar ko rajya ke shikshakon ko sammanit kiya jayega
 And those who do not attend this program will get their salary deducted
 lekin vivaad ke baad is aadesh ko waapas le liya gaya
 The awardees will be the only ones who are appointed after December 13, 2013
 yani vasundhara raaje ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad vaale niyukt kiye gaye shikshak hi sammanit kiye jaaenge
 However, with this order a condition was imposed which was seen as a threat
 sarkaar ne aadesh diya ki jo shikshak is kaarykram main shaamil nahin hoga, uski selary kaat lee jaaegi
 After the dispute, the salary cut order has also been withdrawn
 ye kaarykram 5 sitambar ko shikshak diwas ke maukey par mashhoor amarudon ke baag main yojit hoga
 Since the order, the opposition has been condemning it
 is kaarykram main kisi ke bhi kaale kapade pahanakar aane par bhi pabandi lagaai gai thi
 Education Department of Rajasthan Government issued an order that all the teachers who have been given jobs between December 13, 2013 and September 1, on the day of taking oath of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, all should come to the guava orchard in Jaipur, Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje honors them Will do
 daawa he ki vasundhara sarkaar ne apane kaarykaal ke dauraan kareeb 51746 shikshakon ko naukari di he
 All these teachers will be honored on the occasion of Teacher's Day
 lekin is sammaan ke saath saath ajeebogareeb farmaan bhi bharatpur ke jila shiksha adhikari ne diya tha jisamen kaha gaya he ki jo bhi shikshak jaipur main 5 sitambar ko amaruudon ke baag main sarkaar se sammanit hone ke liye upasthit nahin honge unka vetan kaata jayega

 The government is distinguishing between teachers in this way for votes, while former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has issued a press release saying that the teachers are not treated as slaves by Vasundhara Raje and should not behave in such a manner

 lekin congress ke bheetar netaaon kii lambii line he jo pranab ke vahaan jane par hami bharne ke hi khilaaf the
 But given the stature of Pranab da, the party officially endured silence till Dada's speech at the behest of rahul-sonia

 In the end, Dada also gave a speech, this is what the Congress took
 dada ne kisi ke khilaaf sidhe kuch nahin bolaa, lekin congress ne usakoaresse jodakar samajhaayaa qi dada ne unke sach kaa saamana kara diya
 Overall, whatever Dada did but, daughter Sharmishtha's tweet, Ahmed Patel's writing on her, then Anand Sharma's attack shows that Dada did not do well for the Congress
 lekin apane bhaashan main dada ne kaaphi kuch sanbhalkar bolaa, isliye congress saamne se to dada ke saath hokar aresas par hamalavar he, lekin headgavar par dada kii tipanni usko nagavar gujri he, jis par wo filhal to chup he, lekin jaanati or mahasoos karti he ki dada ne lambey vaqt ke liye dard de diya he

 co / ayyenktf7e Vishnu Sadashivam Kokje has been elected the international president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP)
 shanivaar ko viechpi ke antarrashtriya adhyaksh chunane ke liye matdaan hue
 It is being told that 192 of the 273 delegates voted
 matdaan subah 11:40 baje se shuru hua or dedh baje khatm ho gaya
 The election results came after three in the afternoon
 is chunaav prakriya kii video recording bhi kii gai
 For the first time in 52 years, this election was aimed at overthrowing Togadia, in which the RSS was successful
 shanivaar ko hue chunaav main vishnu sadashivam kokeje ko 192 main 131 vot mili
 At the same time, Raghav Reddy, a supporter of Pravin Togadia, got 60 votes and one vote was invalid
 togadiya ne lagaaya farji votaron kaa aropaviechapi kaaye chunaav isliye bhi khaas rahaa, kyonki 52 saal baad pehali baar adhyaksh pad ke liye chunaav hue hai
 Also, after Praveen Togadia's relationship with BJP and RSS deteriorated, all eyes were on the next president
 chunaav se pehle togadiya ne aarope lagaaya tha ki viechpi kii voter list main 40 farji voter hai
 However, Council's General Secretary Champat Rai made it clear that some outsiders who accompanied Praveen Togadia came to VHP office RK Puram and tried to disrupt the election
 unka aarope he ki yah isliye kiya gaya, taaki baahar se aane vaale log bhramit ho jaaen or chunaav main vot daalane naa aa paae
 Video recording of the election, VHP joint general secretary Surendra Jain said that the election was held for the first time in 52 years in the Vishwa Hindu Parishad
 ye chunaav isliye hua, kyonki ek varg ne sanghathan ke pad main badlaav kii baat kahi or duusare varg ne pad chhodane se manaa kar diya
 Jain said that it would be wrong to say that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh pressurized the election
 vishwa hindu parishad ek swytt sanstha he
 Togadia's relationship with PM Modi is being told that senior Sangh officials were also present there to monitor the entire election
 abhi tak togadiya vishwa hindu parishad ke kaaryakari adhyaksh or raghav reddy adhyaksh the
 Both had ended their tenure last year
 praveen togadiyake pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath rishte thik nahin chal rahe hai
 From time to time, he has been critical of the Modi government
 isliye bijepi or sangh nahin chaahate the ki 2019 ko dekhte hue praveen togadiya vishwa hindu parishad ke antarrashtriya adhyaksh bane kyonki agar vah adhyaksh ban gaye hote, to sarkaar ke liye thik nahin hota
 Before the election, VHP officials were claiming that the defeat of Praveen Togadia and Raghav Reddy faction was certain
 vahiin vishwa hindu parishad ke nae adhyaksh ke rup main ve kokeje pehali pasand bataae ja rahe the
 It was being said that Kokje would win by more than 100 votes

 Official sources said that in view of this, the government is running an awareness campaign for the KCC scheme and free phone numbers on a large scale
 samjhautavadirajdharm yahi vah sutara tha, jiskaa paalan karne kii salaah vaajapeyi ne 2002 ke dangon ke baad gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko di thi
 This was seen as openly reprimanding Modi
 lekin hakrate bhar baad hi, goa main ek anya bhaashan main ve bilkul alag sur main the
 So have they failed to manage their own state of religion? Goa's Marriott Hotel, situated in a quiet street surrounded by trees on the banks of the Mandovi river in Panaji, is not a place that is ideal for determining the political history of the current era of India
 To be seen as a place
 suraj or ret, aramtlabi or mouj-masti kii is jameen par yah hotel apane mehmaanon ko goa main shandaar chhuttiyaan manaane kaa mauka dene par naaj karata he
 In April 2002, however, this hotel was encamped not by the tourists who were seated by the beaches but by the national executive of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 party ke diggajon kii yah baithak us siyaasi tufaan ko dabaane kii garaj se bulaai gai thi jo us vakt party or uske baahar bhi chaaya hua tha
 This executive meeting was held against the backdrop of the Gujarat riots
 mahaj kuch hafton pehle in dangon ne 900 se zyada logon kii jaan le lee thi
 There were speculations that the BJP leadership headed by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee would decide the fate of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi at this meeting
 choubees ghante or saaton din chalane vaala televijan or braking news kaa lagaataar shor-sharaaba abhi nayaa-nayaa hi tha
 We were only a handful of channels and there might not be a cut-throat competition of modern times, but everyone wanted to tell big news first
 tab main pradhanmantri ke sarvashaktimaan prisimple secretary brajesh mishra or bhaajapa ke mukhya kartadharta pramod mahajan ke saath lagaataar sampark main tha
 Both of them promised me that they would keep telling me any big news
 behad ahm baithak se thik pehle mishra ne mujhe phone kiya or kaha, "main samajhataa hum aap badi khabar ke liye taiyaar ho sakate hai, piem ne faisla liya he ki mistar modi ko janaa hoga!'' behad utsaah se main khabar "brake'' karne kii taiyaari kar hi rahaa tha ki mishra ne ek ghante rukne ke liye kaha or saath hi ye bhi kaha, "main tasdik na kar duun tak tak kuch mat karnaa,'' vah tasdik kabhi nahin ai
 Instead, Mahajan left the meeting and came to the hotel lobby to inform the media
 unhone bataaya, "party ne narendrabhai kaa puraa samarthan karne kaa faisla liya he, gujarat main mukhyamantri nahin badla jayega
 "the news began to spread rapidly and i was wondering, what a dramatic change in the meantime that what was considered" fixed "was now being seen as a tremendous support of trust in the Chief Minister
 mahajan ne baad main mana ki vaajapeyi modi ko hataanaa chaahate the, par party ke duusare netaaon ne unki baat ko naamanzoor kar diya
 These "others" also included Mahajan himself and the father of the party and then Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani
 unhone kaha, "hamen laga ki is mode par narendrabhai ko hataane se galat sandesh jayega
 a large number of cadres and Gujaratis are with them and within a year we will have to contest elections in the state, so we felt that we should not ask them to withdraw under pressure
 ''baad main hamen pataa chalaa ki baithak shuru hone se thik pehle modi manch par aae or naatakeey andaaj main unhone istife kii peshkash kii
 Within minutes, the noise of support towards them began to reverberate
 isaki aguai adwani kar rahe the, vah ek shaks jo bhaajapa ke bheetar vaajapeyi kii haisiyat ke baraabar khad ho saktaa tha
 This reflected the well-planned move of mobilization behind the powerful leader of Gujarat

 The next evening, Vajpayee gave a scathing public speech in Goa, at which the party people clapped openly
 yah kavi-raajnneetijna kii vakpatutaa kaa janaa-pahachaanaa pradarshan tha, fark sirf yah tha ki geet ke chhandon kii jagah balashaali aakraamakata ne le lee thi
 Now he spoke of the "jihadi mentality" that exists in every area with a large population of minorities and in contrast to "our" (hindu) tolerance
 phir dangon kii chinagaari ko bhadakaane vaali rail main aag lagaae jane kii godhra kii ghatana ke sandarbh main unhone arthpurna haav-bhav se kaha, "lekin aag kisne lagaai? aag faili kaise?

 a few days ago i was at the Ahmedabad airport, when Vajpayee had reprimanded Modi after visiting relief camps and asked him to "follow his royal religion"
 unki bagal main baithe pashchaatap se bhare dikhaai de rahe mukhyamantri ko badbadaate suna ja saktaa tha ki "ham bhi vahi kar rahe hai sahab
 "so what had suddenly changed between Ahmedabad and Panaji?" Just before the general elections in 2004, i asked Vajpayee in an interview, why did he choose the path to take no action against the leadership of Gujarat in that national executive? His cryptic reply was, "the party had a decision, there was no other option" 
 '' unke jawaab se laachaargi kaa ehsaas jaahir hota tha
 a lot of people seemed to be forced to accept their limits despite being the prime minister and the country's most popular leader
 maine unase gujarat se goa ke bich unka rukh badalane ke bare main poocha, to unka uttar or bhi arthpurna tha
 He said, "when i initially went to Gujarat, i had no idea that Hindus were so brutally burned alive
 jab main goa pahunchaa to yah baat mere dhyaan main laai gai; isse pehle tak main soch rahaa tha ki yah saamaanya danga tha
 "there is very little possibility that Prime Minister Vajpayee would not know about the incident of burning 59 car servants in the train compartment in Godhra
" zyada sambhaavna is baat kii he ki unhen yah ehsaas ho gaya tha ki modi ke bhavishya ko lekar baaki party unke saath ek raay nahin thi
 Where the politician Vajpayee could have taken a more drastic decision, the pained political leader Vajpayee was looking for a way out of it

 Before you too start thinking to see this astronomical event with your eyes, be careful

 Neither now nor ever
 lagata he ki afvaah failaane vaali factriyaan kabhi thakti nahin hai or ek hi afvaah ko saal dar saal failaane se baj nahin aatin

 The US Federal Agency responsible for civilian space programs - National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) - has been trying to warn and educate people since 2005 that it is just rumored that Mars will come so close to Earth
 That it will start to look like the other moon
 lekin hairaani kii baat he ki ye sandesh itane saal se chalaa aa rahaa he or log phir phir bhi ise sach samaj kar circulet karte rahete hai? viral sandesh jisamen ye daawa kiya gaya he ki aaj raat (27 agast) ko mangal dharti ke paas aayega aurchaand ke jitna hi bada dikhegaa, kuch had tak sahi he
 In fact, according to NASA, between 27 July and 30 July last month, it was even closer to the Earth
 tab ye 576 lakh kilometre kii duuri par tha
 Talking about 15 years ago, on 27 August 2003, the Red House ie Mars had come at an extraordinary distance of about 546 lakh kilometers
 nasa ne ek bayaan main kaha, ‘2003 main mangal 60,000 saal main dharti ke sabase kareeb aayaa tha
 So close now that it will never come before 2287 '
 mangal jaisaa saadhaaran taur par dikhataa he uski tulana main 2003 main 6 guna adhik bada or 85 guna zyada chamakdaar najar aayaa tha
 But if Mars comes closer to Earth, we can look big like the moon? The answer is 'no' and not at all
 nasa ne apni website par is afvaah ko lekar logon ko jaagruk or shikshit karne ke liye badi chetavanee di he- ‘mangal kii afvaah se murkh mat banie
 Rumor has it that Mars will look like a moon in the night sky
 agar aisa sach hota to ham dharti, mangal or chand ke gurutvkarshan bal kii vajah se badi pareshaani main hote’
 Click for more information, in this way, those who could not see Mars closest to the Earth in July 2018, will now be able to see the same on 6 October 2020 when the distance between Mars and Earth is 620
 7 lakh kilometre hogi
