 Kejriwal tweeted, "the government should extend the session of Parliament and bring a constitutional amendment bill immediately, otherwise it will be clear that it is a stunt before the election
" ’’ aap ke rajyasabha sadsy sanjay singh ne kaha ki sarkaar ne chunaav ke pehle 10% aarakshan kaa ‘‘swaagat yogya chunavi jumala’’ chhod diya he
 Singh tweeted, "modi government has left a welcome electoral jumla for 10% reservation for economically backward castes, many such states took time to time but more than 50% reservation was stayed by court Is this decision also a gimmick to get the court to stop? ”he said that the government should call a special session to get the Constitution Amendment Bill passed, or else we will support the government
 The decision will be electorally phrase only

 punjab sarkaar puri tarah vifal, ab congress vidhayakon ne bhi lagaai muhar: vipakshmantri gurprit kanghad bole- sirf siem kar sakate hai mantriyon ke kaamkaaj kaa rivupunjab main congress ke vidhayakon ne apni hi sarkaar ke mantriyon ke parformens rivyuu karne kii maang kii he
 Also said that if the Congress ministers do not live up to their work, then the new mlas should be given a chance to become ministers
 punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ke raajnneetik salaahkaar or vidhayak amarinder singh raja vading ne mantriyon ke parformens rivyuu kii baat us samay kahi he, jab punjab main mantrimandal vistaar ko lekar charchaa joro par he
 a new controversy has arisen since his statement
 congress vidhayak amarinder singh raja vading ne kaha ki sarkaar main jo mantri thik se apana kaam nahin kar rahe hai or jinaki parformens sahi nahin he, unhen mantrimandal se baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya janaa chahie
 When the cm's political advisor Amarinder Singh Raja Vading raised the demand to review the performance of the ministers and remove the ministers who did not work properly, some other Congress mlas also came out in support
 congress vidhayak pargat singh or kuldeep vaidya ne bhi amarinder singh raja vading kii haa main haa milaate hue kaha ki pichley 3 saal main jin mantriyon ne thik se parform nahin kiya he or apane mantralay kaa kaam thik se nahin kar sake hai, unki parformens rivyuu karke unhen pad se hataakar nae vidhayakon ko mauka diya janaa chahie
 The Congress mlas who questioned the performance of the ministers were reminded by the cabinet minister of Punjab Government Gurpreet Kangar that if someone is the biggest in the Punjab cabinet and the Punjab government, it is Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who is the party's MLA and Fathers are the same for ministers
 agar kisi bhi tarah kii koi naaraazgi yaa matbhed he, to in naaraaz vidhayakon ko captain amarinder singh ke saamne jaakar apni baat rakhni chahie, naa ki media main is tarah publikali bayaanbaji kerani chahie
 Punjab government minister Gurpreet Kangar said that only Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has the right to review the performance of the ministers and they monitor the functioning of every minister and his ministry
 kanghad ne yah bhi kaha ki is tarah se vidhayakon ko mantriyon ke kaam par sawaal nahin uthaane chahie
 The Opposition parties also got an opportunity to attack the Amarinder government, as the opposition to the Captain Government of Punjab, its mlas of the besieged Congress and the political advisors of CM Captain Amarinder Singh himself, questioned the performance of the ministers
 akali dal ke pravaktaa charanjit barad ne kaha ki congress ke vidhayakon ne apane mantriyon kii parformens par sawaal khadey karke apni sarkaar ko hi katghare main laa diya he
 But this thing is already saying that the people of Punjab and the opposition parties are saying that the Punjab government is not working properly and is failing completely
 ab khud unke vidhayakon ne hi mantriyon ko badalane kii maang or mantriyon kii parformes par sawaal khadey karke is baat par muhar laga di he
 Apart from this, the Aam Aadmi Party also questioned the functioning of the Punjab government and said that the Congress government of the state has failed on every front
 punjab main aam aadmi party ke netaa vipaksh harpal singh cheema ne kaha ki jab punjab sarkaar ke vidhayak hi apane mantriyon or sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par sawaal khadey kar rahe hai, to aise main saaf he ki sarkaar puri tarah se vifal he
 With this, Heharpal Cheimane said that in the last 3 years, while holding the post of ministers, ministers have looted government resources
 aise main jo vidhayak mantri nahin ban paa rahe hai, unhen lagata he ki ab chunaav aane main sirf do saal hi bache hai or aise main bache hue vakt main unhen bhi mantri pad milanaa chahie, taaki wo bhi isi tarah se sarkari khajaane or sansadhano kii lut-khasot kar saken
 Many Punjab Congress mlas are already very angry with their government and Captain Amarinder Singh
 unka maananaa he ki unki hi sarkaar main unki nahin suni ja rahi he or ab yahi naaraazgi lagaataar dhire-dhire badhati ja rahi he
 With only 2 years left for the government's tenure in Punjab, the angry legislators are trying to enter the cabinet by questioning the performance of the ministers
 isi vajah se aae din naaraaz chal rahe vidhayak is tarah ke bayaan khulkar media ke saamne dene main lage hai

 Go Rani will remember this grateful Indian, this sacrifice will be your freedom, indestructible, howe silent history, whether the truth be hanged, madmati triumphs, eradicate goals, Jhansi
 tera smarak tu hi hogi, tu khud amit nishaani thi,bundele harbolon ke munh hamane suni kahani thi,khub ladi mardaani vah to jhaansi vaali rani thi

 Whether the election is for the Lok Sabha or the Vidhan Sabha, the BSP has always decided the candidate long back
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main rajya kii satta se baahar hone ke turant baad bispi pramukh mayawati ne loksabhaa chunaav ke ummidavaar tay kar die the
 However, with the periodic review of the preparation of potential claimants, many names were changed
 yah baat digar he ki itnaa sab karne ke baad bhi basapa ko pichley loksabhaa chunaav main safalataa nahin mili
 Mayawati is now trying to rebuild the party's strong presence in the state
 unhone sabase pehle sanghathanaatmak dhaanche main bada badlaav karne kaa nirnay liya or kai samanvayak badale
 According to the party chief's agenda, the new structure of the organization was laid before Mayawati, which did not meet her criteria and the BSP chief had entrusted the party's responsible leaders to prepare the organization afresh
 sutron kaa kahana he ki rajdhani pravaas ke dauraan mayawati ne pradesh ke 50 se adhik janapadon main party kii taaja sthiti or vahaan ke samikarnon ke hisaab se kareeb 200 siton par vidhansabha chunaav ke sambhavit daavedaar tay kiye hai, jinhen vidhansabha prabharee banaae jayega
 The BSP chiefs will set the target of election preparations for the selected claimants by the end of December and then every four months there will be a thorough review of their preparations
 bispi ke sutara bataate hai ki taiyaariyon kii samiksha kaa kaam vidhansabha chunaav tak lagaataar chalegaa
 During this time, new faces will be given a chance by clearing the cards of those who do not stand the test of the party chief
 sutron kaa kahana he ki pashchimi uttar pradesh or purvachal kii zyaadaatar siton par bispi pramukh ne ummidavaaron ke naam tay bhi kar die hai, lekin abhi tak koi adhikruti soochna nahin jari kii gai he

Election Commission gave open challenge to evms To overcome this, last year, the Election Commission had openly challenged that any expert, scientist and technician of any political party would come and visit for a week or 10 days

 rahul gandhi ke saath upie cheirperson or congress kii purv adhyaksh sonia gandhi bhi jaaengi
 Rahul and Sonia Gandhi's departure to America means that the Gandhi family will stay away from the process of electing the Congress President
 congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi pehle se hi videsh main hai, yani ki vah bhi congress kaary samiti kii baithak main maujuud nahin rahengi
 In such a situation, it is now clear that Rahul Gandhi, taking responsibility for the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, has now put the ball in the ranks of senior Congress leaders

 Because of these, what accidents would have happened or you would be able to see the surrounding looks ugly

 Our colleague Sam Daniel has told that an archway was being built in the middle of the indestructible road of Coimbatore, even the workers who climb on it are not wearing helmets
 ye gir gaye to inkaa kya hoga aap samaj sakate hai
 Pits were dug in the roadway for this archway
 ye nazaaraa aap ghaziabad se lekar pune har jagah dekhte honge
 We understand that political parties are the owners of the country, wherever they want, they can put a photo of their leader
 hamaari haalat ye ho gai he ki ek din ye gharon main bhi hording lagaakar chale jaaenge or ham kuch nahin bol paaenge
 However, 30-year-old Raghu's bike stumbled from this archway or into the pit for the archway, Raghu fell and fell under a truck, died
 america se yah noujvaan apane honi vaali dulhan se milane aayaa tha
 Two families were devastated by this hoarding
 yah hording sattadhari eidiemke kaa tha, jo mjiaar ke janmashti samaaroh ke liye banaaya ja rahaa tha
 The truck driver has been arrested but the hoarder has not been arrested
 police kahati he ki raghupati ne helmet nahin pahana tha
 But whether there was hoarding according to the rules
 kya kisi bhi shahar main hording niyamon ke anusaar lagate hai
 People are expressing their anger over the incident on social media
 raghu ko kisne maaraa, hashtag chal rahaa he
 a huge archway was being built in the middle of the National Highway
 logon ne paint se likh diya he, raghu ko kisne maaraa
 'the Kovai Post' has covered this incident in detail
 diemke ke ek netaa ne hoicourt main saare hording ko hataane ke liye yachika daakhil kar di or parivaar ke liye muaavje kii bhi maang kii
 On Saturday, the Commissioner of Coimbatore ordered the removal of all the hoardings for which permission was not taken
 tippaniyan In a similar incident on October 30 in Chennai, actor Vijay's cutout on an SUV car fell
 katout 28 feet ooncha tha
 The 38-year-old youth was seriously injured in the accident
 raghupati kii maut ko lekar coyambootor main kaaphi gussa he
 The Hindu newspaper reported that on October 25 this year, the Madras High Court had ordered a cutout in the entire state
 hording, flax nahin lagenge
 The High Court had asked the Chief Secretary of the state to implement this order
 magar 'da kowai post' ne bataaya he ki coimbatore main hi kitne hording avaidh rup se bana die gaye hai
 a circular was issued on 16 May 2002 by Road Transport and Highways, clearly stating that no advertisement of hoardings is allowed on the highway, except for public interest related information
 kisi bhi shahar main dekhie, jise jahaan man karata he, vahaan hording laga detaa he
 Many times the redlight is not visible
 uske upar yuva netaa apana poster taang detaa he
 The poster contains photos of ten and twenty other leaders
 kai baar is tarah se tange rahete hai ki jaraa si aandhi chalati he, ye hording girane lagate hai
 a similar incident took place last year near DLF Mall in Noida
 aandhi ai or 20 feet lanbaa or 12 feet chaudaa hording gir gaya
 The bike rider Pushpendra was passing under him and Munna Kumar, who was sitting behind him, died
 6 may 2016 ko ghaziabad ke hindon brij ke paas ek bada sa hording gir gaya
 Five people were injured, two autos and a car were damaged
 ittfa se hamaare sahyogi susheel mahapatra kai dinon se dilli main hording par hi report taiyaar kar rahe the
 Sushil sees it as a violation of rules and a look of filth, but one side of it is quite dangerous
 hamaare sahyogi sam dainiel ne bataaya he ki coimbatore ke avinashi sadak ke beeche bich torana dwaar ban rahaa tha, iske upar jo mazdoor chadhe hai ve bhi helmet nahin pahane hai
 If they fall, you can understand what will happen to them
 is torana dwaar ke liye sadak main gadde khod daale gaye
 You will see these scenes everywhere from Ghaziabad to Pune
 ham samajhate hai ki raajnneetik dal desh ke maalik hai, jahaan chahen, vahaan apane netaa kaa photo laga sakate hai
 Our condition has become that one day they will go to homes with hoardings and we will not be able to say anything
 baharhaal, 30 saal ke raghu kii bike is torana dwaar se yaa torana dwaar ke liye bane gadde main padakar ladkadaa gai, raghu gir gaya or ek trek ke neeche aa gaya, mar gaya
 This young man from America came to meet his future bride
 do-do parivaar tabah ho gaye, is hording ke kaaran
 The hoardings belonged to the ruling AIDMK, which was being built for mgr's centenary celebrations
 trek dryver to giraftaar ho gaya lekin hording lagane vaale kii giraftaar nahin hui he
 Police say Raghupati did not wear a helmet
 par kya vahaan hording niyamon ke anusaar laga tha
 Whether hoardings in any city are as per rules
 soshal media par log is ghatana ko lekar apana rosh zaahir kar rahe hai
 Who killed Raghu, the hashtag is going on
 neshnal haive ke bich-bich vishaal toranadwar ban rahaa tha
 People have written with paint, who killed Raghu
 'da kowai post' ne is ghatana ko vistaar se cover kiya he
 a DMK leader filed a petition in the High Court for the removal of all hoardings and also demanded compensation for the family
 shanivaar ko coimbatur ke kamishnar ne un saare hording ko jinke liye anumati nahin lee gai tha hataane ke liye aadesh diya
 The comments chennai main 30 aktubar ko aisi hi ek ghatana main esayuvi car par actor vijay kaa katout gir gaya
 The cutout was 28 feet high
 is durghatana main 38 saal kaa noujvaan gambhir rup se ghayal ho gaya
 There is a lot of anger in Coimbatore about Raghupati's death
 hindu akhbaar kii khabar he ki isi saal 25 aktubar ko hi madras hoicourt ne aadesh diya tha ki puure rajya main katout
 Hoarding will not cause flakes
 hoicourt ne rajya ke mukhya sachiv se kaha tha ki is aadesh ko lagu karaaen

 In 'I am Krishna', Juhi Chawla or Kanta Ben runs an orphanage, where destitute children are raised
 krishna naam kaa ek baccha bhi usee kaa ek sadsy he, jo apni paristhitiyon kii vajah se dukhi he, lekin baad main khud krishna bhagwaan unke saamne prakat hone lagate hai
 Now in the film the two become Krishna and both together eliminate the evils around them
 krishna kii is ladaai main katrina caff ke bhi kuch ection seens hai
 Krishna has become so famous that even Hrithik Roshan comes to meet him
 bhagwaan krishna kaa kirdaar anemated he
 Though it is a feature film, but some part of the film is animated except for Lord Krishna
 vaise, agar film main anemated hissaa or zyada hota to shaayad bachche or maje le pate, kyonki dramatic kahani bahut zyada prabhaavshaalee nahin he
 There are issues like social problem, exploitation of children and adulteration of milk in the film, but these issues are far ahead in terms of children
 tippaniyan Everything has been tried to make the children happy, be it animated characters, comedy, action, emotions, or the guest roles of stars like Hrithik and Katrina
 ho saktaa he bacchon ke mata-pita ko kahani or screen play main zyada majaa na aae, lekin bacchon kii khushi ke liye maa-baap ko har cheez sahani padati he, yani bachche khush to maa-baap khush
 In the film, Lord Krishna says that God is with the adventurers
 bacchon ko khush karne kii koshish karte diarector rajeev ruiya ke is saahas ke liye reating he, 2

 ab film main do krishna ho jate hai or donon milakar apane aasapaas kii buraaiyon ko khatm karte hai
 Katrina Kaif also has some action scenes in this battle of Krishna
 krishna ab itnaa mashhoor ho chukaa he ki usase milane ruthik roshan bhi unke ghar aate hai
 The character of Lord Krishna is animated
 vaise to yah feechar film he, lekin lord krishna ke alaava film kaa kuch hissaa anemated he
 By the way, if the film had more of an animated part, the children might have enjoyed it more, because the dramatic story is not very impressive
 film main samaajik samasya, bacchon kaa shoshan or doodh main milawat jaise mudde to hai, lekin ye mudde bacchon ke lihaaj se kuch zyada aage ke hai
 The comments bacchon ko khush karne ke liye har cheez daalane kii koshish kii gai he phir vah chaahe anemated karactor ho, kamedi ho, ection ho, imoshan ho yaa ruthik or katrina jaise stars kii mehmaan bhoomika ho
 The parents of the children may not enjoy the story and screen play much, but for the happiness of the children, the parents have to endure everything, that is, the children are happy and the parents are happy
 film main lord krishna kehete hai ki saahas karne waalon ke saath bhagwaan hote hai
 Director Rajiv Ruia has a rating for this adventure while trying to make children happy, 2

 In the presidential election, opposition candidate PA Sangma has made fresh allegations against UPA nominee Pranab Mukherjee of holding two more positions of profit so far
 saath hi pranab mukherjee kii ummidavaari ke silsile main jataai gai aapattiyon kii phir se jaanch ke liye chunaav ayog se hastkshep karne kii maang kii he
 a three-member delegation on behalf of Sangma approached the Election Commission, expressing dissatisfaction over his complaint being rejected by the election officer of the presidential election
 ayog ne unhen apni maang ke bare main likhit rup main somvaar shaam tak daleel pesh karne kaa vakt diya he
 After the meeting, Janata Party President Subrahmanyam Swamy claimed that Mukherjee still holds two more posts of profit as the Vice President of the 'virbhum Institute of Engineering and Technology' and the President of the 'rabindra Bharati Society'
 unhone kaha ki pratinidhimandal ne mukhya nirvachan ayukta vies sanpat se mulaakaat kii or apni chintaaon se unhen avgat karaayaa
 The constitution allows the Election Commission to intervene in conducting elections
 swami ne kaha, ‘yahaan dhokhadhadi kaa mudda he
 Let the Election Commission decide whether there has been any fraud in the nomination filing process
 chunaav ayog ko antim faisla karne dijie
 The delegation also included BJP leader and Sangma's lawyer Satyapal Jain and his election agent Bhartrihari Mahtab
 is pratinidhimandal ne bhartiya sankhyikeey santhaan (iesai) se mukherjee ke istife par unke hastakshar kaa mudda uthaaya
 Opposing the decision of the Returning Officer, Jain said that he has presented three arguments before the Election Commission and demanded his intervention
 unhone kaha ki niyamon ke mutabik chunaav ayog ke paas hastkshep karne kii shakti he kyonki chunaav prakriya jari he
 We will present our written reply on Monday
 unhone kaha ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 324 ke tahat chunaav ayog ko sabhi chunaav karaane or uski nigaraanee karne kaa kshetradhikaar praapt he tathaa halaat uske hastkshep kii maang karata he
 Jain cited the recent Rajya Sabha elections in Jharkhand and the Lok Sabha election of Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna from Garhwal in 1980, stating that the Election Commission intervened on these occasions during the election process
 unhone bataaya, ‘hamane mukhya chunaav ayukta se kaha ki niyamon ke mutabik nirvachan adhikari unke dwaara jataai gai sabhi aapattiyon par vichaar karne ke liye kartavyabaddh hai
 The Election Officer has not considered all the objections raised on our behalf
 ’mehataab ne kaha, ‘is tarah se nirvachan adhikari ne us vyakti kii madad kii, jinke khilaaf farjivada ke aarope lagaae gaye hai
 Pranab Mukherjee's resignation from ISI was not properly accepted as MGK Menon is not the competent authority to accept it
 ’pratinidhimandal dwaara chunaav ayog ke samaksh uthaai gai aapattiyon main ye baaten bhi shaamil hai ki nirvachan adhikari ke paas prastaavkon or anumodakon ke hastakshron kii jaanch karne kii shakti he
 He also has a duty to check the veracity of his signatures
 sangama kheme ne mukherjee ke istipha patr kaa mudda uthaaya tha, jisapar unka hastakshar vivaadaaspad tha
 It was also controversial that the letter was of previous date
 jain ne kaha ki in aapattiyon par vichaar karne kii bajaay nirvachan adhikari ne kaha ki ye aise mudde hai jinpar faisla anya uchit forum se diya ja saktaa he
 However, the Election Officer did not name the forum
 yachikakartaon ne kaha he ki raashtrapati evam uparashtrapati chunaav adhinium kii dhara paanch (i) ke tahat yadi prastaavak yaa anumodak ke hastakshron ke bare main vivaad he yaa is silsile main koi farjivada he, to nirvachan adhikari is vishay par faisla kar sakate hai

 So i have issued the order of mutation

 Now Rajpal is considering this day like a Diwali
 kehete hai ki main or meraa parivaar enditvi kaa shukragajar he
 In fact, Rajpal had applied to the DDA for registration of names 22 years ago in 1993, so that the father's property could be divided among the brothers, but the file of Rajpal, who refused to pay bribe, remained stuck for more than two decades
 is puure maamle par khud didie ke afasar bhi hairaani jataa chuke hai

 Activists visiting five-star hotels say that if there are meetings in the Five Star Hotel, how will the money be saved? Archana Sharma, vice president and spokesperson of Rajasthan Congress, is going door-to-door with the characters in hand and collecting money by asking for donations from the people
 ye akeli congress netaa nahin he, jo aisa kar rahi hai
 These days, Congress leaders will be seen asking for donations in every street
 paise nahin hone kaa raag alaap rahi congressek orcongress chunaavladane ke liye paisa nahin hone kaa raag alaap rahi he
 The Congress says it does not have the money to contest elections
 lihaaja janata usko vot ke saath hi note bhi de
 Rajasthan Congress President Sachin Pilot has sought donations from people on Twitter
 rahi sahi kasar congress mukhyalay ne puri kar di
 The order issued from the Congress Head Quarters said that attention should be paid to reduce the expenses in the party and the journey from Delhi to Jaipur should also be done by train instead of plane

 In Rajasthan, Kumari Sailja, the chairman of the screening committee, arrived in Jaipur to get an opinion on ticket distribution and took feedback from Congress workers at the Five Star Hotel Clark Amber

 If these five stars meet in the hotel, then how can common workers meet them
 nagaur jile ke jaayal block ke adhyaksh triloki ram kaa bhi kahana he ki five star hotel main meeting thik nahin he
 There is a difference between Congress' actions and statements: BJP: Earlier on Wednesday, Rahul Gandhi himself addressed the leaders of Youth Congress in a five-star hotel
 congress adhyaksh kaa doosraa kaarykram bhi paanch sitara hotel raajapootaana sheraton main hua tha
 The BJP is telling the difference between this and the statement of the Congress
 bijepi pravaktaa or jaipur ke meyar ashok lahoti ne kaha kicongresski kerani or kathani main hameshaa se fark rahaa he
 The matter of not having the money to contest elections is the pretense of Congress leaders, while their habits are highway star
 congress ke netaa ek taraf bazaaron or gharon main chanda maangegein or duusari taraf meeting five star hotalon main karenge, to sawaal uthenge hi
 Congress's own workers are also saying that the government is not yet formed and leaders are starting to distance themselves from the workers
 mumbai ke akhabaaron main jald hi parsi samaaj ko sambodhit karte dilachasp poster jhalkenge
 The posters are aimed at Parsis who are unmarried despite crossing the age of marriage, or Parsi couples who, for some reason, are yet to produce children
 postaron kii tasviren or sandesh kaaphi dilachasp hai
 For example, a middle-aged Zoroastrian standing on a black Fiat car is being asked, 'dada's Fiat, Papa's Rolex Watch Who Will Leave?' In the second poster, where a Parsi mother is serving breakfast to her son, the question is written, 'how long will you be tied to the mother's pallu?' in tasveeron ne jahaan kai parsiyon ko gudgudaya he, vahiin kuch ise hairaani se dekh rahe hai
 Concerned about the declining number of Parsi society in India, Parsi organizations have made a direct appeal to the Parsi community to increase its population by making this poster
 in postaron ke peeche kii kalpana bhi parsi kalakaaron kii he
 On these unabashed posters created by famous advertising producer Sam Balsara's company Madison India, Balsara told NDTV, "advertising works only when it touches a sore throat
 hamaare postaron par charchaa or vivaad bhale hi chhide, lekin shaayad yahi sahi tareeqa ho
 "posters will also feature Parsi actors like Parizad Zorabian and Boman Irani
 yah poster kuch chintajanak aankadon ko masakhre sandesh main tabdeel karte hai
 The number of Zoroastrians who made a mark in many areas including the country's history, economy, at the time of independence was about 1
 15 lakh thi, aaj 69,000 ke aasapaas he
 These figures are also from the 2001 census, the latest figures are expected to fall further

 Benevolent and outspoken, she said, "parsi rites in me have been coddled, and there was no question of marrying a non-parsi
 haalanki bachche kab or kitne hon, aisa koi dabaav hamaare pariwaron se nahin he
 " lekin 29 saal ke sangeetkaar kaijad gharda is muhim se puri tarah aashwast nahin lagate
 He says that the society has more objection that many youth are marrying non-zoroastrians
 parsi hone ke myne mahaj aasthaa se jude nahin hai, yahaan vansh or khun ko lekar kade vichaar bhi hai
 To increase the number of this society, the central government has also planned a scheme like 'jiyo Parsi' of Rs 10 crore, in which medical aid is provided to the needy Parsi couples for procuring children, and this recent campaign pointed to this scheme
 She also does

 In Railway Ministry advertisements with your accumulated tax, neither the late running of the train nor the cold wedding machine on the platform is bad

 However, Anwar noticed that two to two cold water vending machines at Moradabad station are defective
 hamane hardoi stesan kaa dikhaaya ki kaise pani kii vendish mashin teen maheene se kharaab he
 After four to five days of showing, if the water vending machine cannot be fixed and still you expect from the media, your expectations should also get the Nobel Prize

 Let us look at the speed of some trains running late
 hamane jab check kiya tha tab ke hisaab se ham bataa rahe hai
 15212 Jannayak Express opened on May 27 with a delay of 13 hours 55 minutes and was delayed 21 hours 52 minutes on the way
 15910 avadh assam express 26 may ko chali thi, barpeta road stesan pahunchate pahunchate 17 ghante 4 minute let ho chuki thi

 Now nothing could be done immediately, so when Sealdah reached the capital Mughalsarai at two o'clock in the morning, the employees made cartoons with correct pronunciation cotton on the windows and made a stop-gap arrangement by sticking plastic so that the passengers could reach the destination
 magar ghayal yatriyon ke liye koi vyavastha nahin thi
 Our colleague Ajay Singh has told that Mughalsarai is a division, many big railway officials live here, no one came to know about them even after such a big incident
 yatriyon ne bataaya ki kai ghanton se koi train khadi thi jise roak kar rajdhani ko paas karaayaa ja rahaa tha
 Passengers became furious with this and started throwing stones at the capital
 rajdhani par patharav ho saktaa he, usamen safar kar rahe yatriyon ne sochaa bhi nahin tha
 Like how everyone saved their lives
 logon ko ek baat samajni chahie
 If there is a problem with running late, then demand it, rather take out the anger on the train coach
 apane gusse ko samajhie
 Look into yourself how you have tolerated for many years that you are running for twenty hours on a late train, but that does not mean picking up a stone and hitting the coach

 This morning, a message came from 1000 engineers of Uttar Pradesh that their job had gone away last year

 If such a robbery has taken place, it can be investigated in two minutes
 bahut se log aisi shikaayat karte hai ki ve sin bees hazaar kii selary par karte hai magar haath main 12,000 miltaa he
 Such loot is possible only in India

 We have to fight our own battles also

 If you look closely you will cry

 He was able to give importance to his waste so much that he worked hard and messaged me on whatsapp that the exam is not going on

 jaiprakash narayan uniwarsity kii 24 march ko baithak hui thi
 It was decided that by the end of this year all the examinations will be done
 isamen aap bihar uniwarsity ko bhi jod lijie
 That is why i say that research scholars from all the universities of the world should come to Bihar and study how six million students of 6 years will test in six months from June to December
 yah duniya main pariksha kaa sabase bada event hone ja rahaa he
 If indeed all the examinations took place in six months, then it means that there will be no studies, only and only examination
 railway kii khidki se jhaankati bharat kii garibi
 The memory of your train journey will start running in the eyes of these children standing at the window

 As soon as the camera approaches, peeping inside, it is revealed that it is not a coach, it is a toilet

 These eight people have neither seen the press conference of the Railway Minister on TV nor have seen the advertisements printed in the newspapers that the railway has turned around

 They say three machines are fine
 phir bhi chaar to karaab hai
 He also stated that the company had not deposited the money for 7 months

 Passengers told that for several hours a train was standing which was being stopped and passed to the capital
 yatri is baat ko lekar ugr ho gaye or rajdhani par patharav shuru kar diya
 There may be stone pelting on the capital, the passengers traveling in it did not even think

 janata kii zindagi main jo bhuuchaal aata he uske bare main desh kii raajnneeti kitni parvaah karti he aap samaj gaye honge
 Let us look at the speed of some trains running late
 hamane jab check kiya tha tab ke hisaab se ham bataa rahe hai
 15212 Jannayak Express opened on May 27 with a delay of 13 hours 55 minutes and was delayed 21 hours 52 minutes on the way
 15910 avadh assam express 26 may ko chali thi, barpeta road stesan pahunchate pahunchate 17 ghante 4 minute let ho chuki thi
 22405 Bhagalpur Anand Vihar Garib Rath 26 May train has reached Anandvihar on 28 May, 26 hours 8 minutes late
 04403 barauni anand vihaar asi express special
 The train on 26 May reached Anand Vihar on 28 May 19 hours 5 minutes late

 Now nothing could be done immediately, so when Sealdah reached the capital Mughalsarai at two o'clock in the morning, the employees made cartoons with correct pronunciation cotton on the windows and made a stop-gap arrangement by sticking plastic so that the passengers could reach the destination
 magar ghayal yatriyon ke liye koi vyavastha nahin thi
 Our colleague Ajay Singh has told that Mughalsarai is a division, many big railway officials live here, no one came to know about them even after such a big incident
 yatriyon ne bataaya ki kai ghanton se koi train khadi thi jise roak kar rajdhani ko paas karaayaa ja rahaa tha
 Passengers became furious with this and started throwing stones at the capital
 rajdhani par patharav ho saktaa he, usamen safar kar rahe yatriyon ne sochaa bhi nahin tha
 Like how everyone saved their lives
 logon ko ek baat samajni chahie
 If there is a problem with running late, then demand it, rather take out the anger on the train coach
 apane gusse ko samajhie
 Look into yourself how you have tolerated for many years that you are running for twenty hours on a late train, but that does not mean picking up a stone and hitting the coach
 sharmnaak he
 This morning, a message came from 1000 engineers of Uttar Pradesh that their job had gone away last year

 The name of this project was SWAN
 sabhi rajyon main aisi pariyojna thi
 They say that the UP government has stopped the scheme and discharged it
 inkaa ye bhi aarope he ki sarkaar inhen vetan ke rup main 38,000 detii thi magar jis company ko detii thi usase unhen 15000 rupee hi milte the
 If such a robbery has taken place, it can be investigated in two minutes
 bahut se log aisi shikaayat karte hai ki ve sin bees hazaar kii selary par karte hai magar haath main 12,000 miltaa he
 Such loot is possible only in India
 jitne bhi aise log luute ja rahe hai un sabko milakar ladanaa chahie
 We have to fight our own battles also

 They continue to run throughout the day

 If you look closely you will cry

 He was able to give importance to his waste so much that he worked hard and messaged me on whatsapp that the exam is not going on
 hamaare chaatr kitne mehnatee ho gaye hai
 The students of the 2015-18, 2016-19, 2017-20 batch have not been tested for even a year
 is par harvard uniwarsity, cambridge uniwarsity waalon ko research karnaa chahie ki kaise bihar rajya ke lakhon chaatr bina imtahaan ke chaatr jivan guzaar rahe hai
 Only the 2013-16 batch has been tested for three years
 jaiprakash narayan uniwarsity kii 24 march ko baithak hui thi
 It was decided that by the end of this year all the examinations will be done
 isamen aap bihar uniwarsity ko bhi jod lijie
 That is why i say that research scholars from all the universities of the world should come to Bihar and study how six million students of 6 years will test in six months from June to December
 yah duniya main pariksha kaa sabase bada event hone ja rahaa he
 If indeed all the examinations took place in six months, then it means that there will be no studies, only and only examination
 sangeeta ke do saal ab koi nahin lautaa saktaa magar aaj kii shaam sangeeta kii barbaadi se kisi ko sahanubhuti nahin, sab yahi pataa kar rahe honge pranab mukherjee sangh mukhyalay ja rahe hai to desh kii raajnneeti main kya bhuuchaal aa rahaa he
 You must have understood how much politics of the country cares about the earthquake that occurs in the lives of the people
 aaiye let se chal rahi kuch gadiyon kii chaal par gaur karte hai
 We are telling you when we checked
 15212 jananaayak express 27 may ko 13 ghante 55 minute kii deree se khuli or raste main 21 ghante 52 minute let ho gai

 12331 himgiri express ke ek yatri ne twit kiya he ki 3 maheene main iske let hone ke kaaran 4 baar flite chhot gai he
 On Monday night, Sealdah Rajdhani going from Sealdah to New Delhi was stoned near Gaya station, due to which the windows of more than 1 dozen coaches of the train were damaged
 ab turant to kuch kiya nahin ja saktaa tha isliye jab sava do baje sialdah rajdhani mughalsarai pahunchi to karmchaariyon ne khidakiyon par cartoon jiskaa sahi uccharan katan he or plastic chipkaakar kaamchalaoo intazaam kar diya taaki yatri manzil tak pahunch jaaen
 But there was no arrangement for the injured passengers
 hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne bataaya he ki mughalsarai ek division he, railway ke kai bade adhikari yahaan rahete hai, itani badi ghatana hone ke baad bhi koi inkaa haal jaanane nahin pahunchaa
 Passengers told that for several hours a train was standing which was being stopped and passed to the capital
 yatri is baat ko lekar ugr ho gaye or rajdhani par patharav shuru kar diya
 There may be stone pelting on the capital, the passengers traveling in it did not even think
 jaise taise sabane apni jaan bachaai
 People should understand one thing
 deree se chalane ko lekar samasya he to isaki maang kiijie, na ki gussa rail ke coach par nikaaliye
 Understand your anger
 khud main jhankie ki kai saal se aapane yah bardaasht kaise kiya hua he ki bees bees ghante let train se chal rahe hai lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki pathar uthaakar coach par de maaraa
 Is embarrassing
 aaj subah subah uttar pradesh ke 1000 ejiniyaron kii taraf se messej aayaa ki pichley saal unki naukari chali gai he
 These people were ensuring the availability of internet and facility of video conferencing at district, block, tehsil level for 8 years
 is pariyojna kaa naam tha swaan
 All states had such projects
 inkaa kahana he ki upi sarkaar ne is yojana ko band kar diya he or inaki chuttee kar di he
 They also allege that the government used to give them 38,000 as salary but they used to get only Rs 15,000 from the company they used to give
 agar aisi lut hui he to isaki jaanch do minute main kii ja sakati he
 Many people complain that they sign on a salary of twenty thousand but they get 12,000 on hand
 is tarah kii lut bharat main hi sambhav he
 All such people who are being robbed should fight together
 apni ladaai khud bhi ladani padati he
 In the Income Tax Department, Excise Department, 3287 students have not received appointment letters yet
 das maheene se ye intazaar kar rahe hai
 We have been speaking in prime time daily for a week, but till date, Finance Minister Piyush Goyal, who is called Dynamic in the media, did not give him an appointment letter nor did he give any concrete answer to when
 somvaar ko kuch ladke daftar bhi gaye the magar kisi ne inase mulaakaat nahin kii
 i am telling all this so that the advertisements that the government gets printed with the tax money given to you, the ministers who hold press conferences in every state and district, all these things are not told or asked
 tippaniyan In prime time, through the Ambedkar University in North Bihar, we have proposed a political theory that if the state wishes, it can put five to six lakh youth in the same class for two years without examination
 yuvaaon main raajnneetik chetana or urja ek myth or bogus avadharana he
 Really the condition of these students is very bad
 ye din bhar uniwarsity daudte rahete hai
 Nobody listens to them
 aap kareeb se dekhege to ro denge
 Millions of students of Jai Prakash Narayan University were sitting in the same class without examination

 If there is a problem with running late, then demand it, rather take out the anger on the train coach
 apane gusse ko samajhie
 Look into yourself how you have tolerated for many years that you are running for twenty hours on a late train, but that does not mean picking up a stone and hitting the coach

 inkaa ye bhi aarope he ki sarkaar inhen vetan ke rup main 38,000 detii thi magar jis company ko detii thi usase unhen 15000 rupee hi milte the
 If such a robbery has taken place, it can be investigated in two minutes
 bahut se log aisi shikaayat karte hai ki ve sin bees hazaar kii selary par karte hai magar haath main 12,000 miltaa he
 Such loot is possible only in India

 If indeed all the examinations took place in six months, then it means that there will be no studies, only and only examination

 They also allege that the government used to give them 38,000 as salary but they used to get only Rs 15,000 from the company they used to give
 agar aisi lut hui he to isaki jaanch do minute main kii ja sakati he
 Many people complain that they sign on a salary of twenty thousand but they get 12,000 on hand

 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko patr likhakar yah kehete hue khaadya suraksha kanoon par mukhyamantriyon kii ek baithak bulaane kaa prastaav kiya he ki yah ek aisa mudda he ki jisase centre or rajya sarkaron donon kaa vaasta he
 The comments modi ne patr main aarope lagaaya he ki garib pariwaron ko adhyadesh ke jariye ‘khaadya arakshit’ bana diya gaya he jo ‘khaadya suraksha ke mul uddeshyon kii purti nahin karata
 'he has alleged in the letter dated August 7 that the ordinance under the ordinance' impracticable statutory responsibilities have been assigned to the Central and State Governments 'and' the number of beneficiaries has been fixed without fixing eligibility criteria and individual rights
 vibhinn rajyon ke bich vyapak kshetreey asamanthaayen ho sakati hai
 ' modi ke anusaar sansad kii sthaayee samiti ne janvari 2013 main sifarish kii thi ki sarkaar ko rajya sarkaar se salaah mashvira karke paatrata maandand tay karne chahie
 He said that the ordinance proposed reducing the entitlement of families living below the poverty line from 35 kg per family to 25 kg for a family of five
 ‘yah khaadya suraksha vidheyak kaa uddeshy nahin ho saktaa jo un logon kaa haq ghataata he jinaki pahchaan garibi rekha ke neeche rahane vaale ke rup main hui he
 He said that on the other hand the Planning Commission is claiming that the number of BPL families has decreased but under the ordinance there is a matter of providing food assistance to two-thirds of the population
 is par rajyon se charchaa honi chahie
 Modi has alleged in the letter that poor families have been made a 'food reserve' through an ordinance which does not fulfill the basic objectives of food security
 ’ unhone saat agast kii tithi vaale patr main aarope lagaaya he ki adhyadesh ke tahat ‘avyavhaarya vaidhanik jimmedaariyaan centre or rajya sarkaron ko di gai hai’ or ‘labhaarthiyon kii sankhya paatrata ke maandand or vyaktigat adhikaar tay kiye bina tay kar di gai he
 There can be wide regional disparities between different states
 ’ According to Modi, the Parliamentary Standing Committee had recommended in January 2013 that the government should decide the eligibility criteria after consulting the state government

 In the ongoing 'panchayat Aaj Tak' in Mumbai, the assembly elections going on in Maharashtra and the development of the state are being discussed
 is kaarykram main kai nami-giraami shakhsiyaten shirkat kar rahi hai
 The subject of this session is Marathi issue
 rajaneta kirit somaiya, sanjay nirupam, abu azmi or balaanandgaanvkar panchayat aaj tak main apni raay rakh rahe hai
 
 
 Question: What is the issue of Marathi? How does it become an issue of vote politics
 balaanandgaanvakarshapaka sawaal galat he
 This is my mother tongue
 is desh main bhashik aadhaar par rajya bane hai
 We live in Maharashtra
 ye bhashaa kaa, iske sammaan kaa mudda hamaara mudda he
 Question: Will it eradicate hunger, poverty
 balaanandgaanvakarbaiske liye satta main baithe jimmedaar logon se poocha janaa chahie
 People of Maharashtra pay taxes to the government
 sarkaar ko unhen suvidha deni chahie
 We also have a responsibility as the opposition
 sawaalh shivasena bhi marathi maanush par khadi he
 What to say Kirit Somaiya as an associate of Yuti: We cannot weigh language with the politics of votes
 maharashtra main marathi rajyabhasha he
 It shows the culture and identity of the place
 shivasena ho yaa bijepi, ye sabhi ke liye sammaan or adhikaar kaa vishay he
 This is what every person living in Mumbai or Maharashtra thinks
 magar ye chunavi mudda nahin he
 This is his respect-less attitude
 sawaalh magar gairmarathi bhashi logon ko ye ehsaas karaayaa jaataa he ki ve doum darje ke hai yaa kuch galat kar rahe hai
 Abu Azmi: See, i swore in Hindi
 marathi main nahin lee
 Its purpose was not to insult any language
 magar logon ne ise raajnneetik mudda bana liya
 Hindi is my mother, Marathi is my aunt
 mumbai ek international shahar he
 There are all kinds of people here
 alag-alag rajya hai
 Speak in which language there
 mere khyaal se ye kaam hindi karti he
 Kirit Somaiya: If someone grew up here
 or fidd bhi yahaan kii bhashaa nahin bolta
 Even then it should not be made an election issue
 balaanandgaanvakarpahindi raashtra bhashaa nahin sampark bhashaa he
 But you should not respect the language of which people choose you and speak it
 main yahaan aayaa hum
 In Hindi you are asking questions
 main jawaab de rahaa hum
 So i am respecting Hindi
 ye koi thopane kii baat nahin he
 Abu Azmi: Don't teach us
 hamen marathi bhi aati he
 If i speak, i will start saying this, i am speaking under our pressure
 sawaalh uttar bharatiyon par atyaachaar hota he or maharashtra sarkaar chup rahati haisanjay nirupamjaaye aap nahin kah sakate
 900 cases have been registered against the MNS leaders across the state on this issue
 abu azmismgar aaj tak koi jail nahin gaya
 This is an inside matter
 sanjay nirupamahsarkaar or police ek prakriya ke tahat kaam karti he
 All parties like MNS will come and go
 ham unki vichaardhaara ko kabhi sweekaar nahin karte
 We carry all languages together
 sabhi kaa sammaan karte hai
 Question: Due to the aggressive campaign of MNS, the workers had to flee from here
 Bala: You think we like to create a riot
 court janaa acha lagata he
 Question: a woman who was the wife of a laborer
 usne train main bachche ko janm diya
 You understand the meaning of this problem
 balahhamen khushi nahin he
 Sometimes there are incidents that become incurable
 sanjay nirupamaisawaal ye he ki mumbai kiski he
 Is the capital of Maharashtra
 marathi logon kaa apana haq banataa he
 But non-marathi speakers also contribute a lot in making this city
 parsi, gujarati, uttar bharat ke majdoor log, offis kaa kaam karne vaale south ke log
 The sum of all these increased the status of Mumbai
 yahaan ek bhashaa yaa jati ke naam par log pareshaan kiye jaaenge to mumbai kii takat kam hogi
 Bala: Why do people come here from every corner of the country for recruitment
 apane rajya main kyon daakhil nahin hote
 Why should our children not get jobs? sanjay nirupamaurelway kii baat clear kar detaa hum
 In 2003, the people of Bihar were killed by the MNS in Kalyan
 tab vaajapeyi ji kii sarkaar thi
 Shiv Sena was a partner
 ham sab us party main the
 It was then said that this recruitment system should be changed
 aapane un bacchon par hamalaa kiya jo khud ko dephend nahin kar sakate the
 This method was wrong
 balahjab ham shivasena main the, to supremeo bala sahib the
 It was our job to obey his order
 hamaara yahi kahana he ki maharashtra main bhartee ho, to yahaan ke logon ko praathamikta mili
 Kirit Somaiya: Marathi language identity in Mumbai should get the top position
 lekin iske liye kisi ko maarna galati he
 But taking political advantage of this is also a sin
 abu azmiah aapane koun si aag bujhaai
 You were also with these people
 aapane pani daalaa kya is aag par
 Question: How long will this type of politics last? Sanjay Nirupam: bjp's dilemma
 shivasena ko pakaden yaa manase ko
 Modi insists that MNS should not field against him
 balajaaye aarope galat he
 We came to the ground in many places and fought vigorously
 rahi marpet kii baat, to ye galat he
 Abu Azmi: Due to the violence of Manse, many laborers and watchmen died
 balahapake azamgarh ke log yahaan aakar hatya kar bhaag jate hai
 Abu Azmi: People of Ajamgarh, UP, Bihar have decorated Mumbai

 '' aakraamak mudra main aate hue congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne buudhvaar ko narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki 'mukhute main asli cheharaa' chipa hua he
 Taking a dig at Modi's close aide Amit Shah's remarks on 'revenge', he said that the bjp's one-point agenda is to spread communalism
 sonia ne gujarat main 2009 main gujarat police adhikariyon dwaara ek yuvati kii kathith jasusi karne ke maamle kaa paroksh zikr karte hue karnataka kii chunavi reliyon main yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki rajya main mahilaon par atyaachaar kiye ja rahe hai
 Criticizing the Gujarat model of development being repeatedly mentioned by Modi, he said that some people have such a habit of presenting small things in a big way as if no good work is happening in other states
 kolar main unhone kaha, 'in dinon aap puure desh main dekh sakate hai ki bade or mahange vigyapanon kaa pradarshan kiya ja rahaa he or satya ko chhipaane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 ' congress adhyaksh ne modi kaa naam liye bina un par prahaar karte hue kaha, 'mukhute ke jariye ek vyakti kaa asli cheharaa dhankane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 He is being treated as a magician for the treatment of all problems and for the country
 ' The Congress president accused the BJP of spreading hatred among the brothers to hide their mistakes
 unhone kaha ki aise prayaas samaaj ke saamaajik tanebane ko todane ke makasad se kiye ja rahe hai
 He said at his rally in Mysore, 'congress always fought to maintain communal harmony but the bjp's only agenda is to spread communalism which is highlighted by the statement of one of its leaders in Uttar Pradesh
 unka asli cheharaa ek baar phir saamne aa gaya he
 ' sonia kaa paroksh rup se ishaara us vivaad kii ore tha jo shah ke bayaan se utpann hua tha
 Shah said that the general election, especially in western Uttar Pradesh, is an 'election of honor'
 yah apmaan kaa badla lene kaa chunaav he
 The election should teach a lesson to those who have done injustice
 ' The UPA president said that the 2014 election is more important than ever because it will decide what kind of India we want
 unhone kaha, 'ek taraf congress loktantr main vishwaas karti he, bharat kii ganga jamuni tahjeeb main bharosa karti he, dharmanirpeksh mulyon ko maanati he tathaa sabhi nagarikon ko ek aankh se dekhati he or samaaj ko ekajute rakhana chaahati he
 We are seeking votes in this election for such a Congress
 ' congress pramukh ne kaha, '
 
 or bhaajapa he jo ek vyakti ke liye vot maang rahi he
 Who has no faith in the Ganga Jamuni Tehzeeb of India
 ' Reacting to Modi questioning the UPA claims on major schemes like MNREGA and RTI, Sonia blamed the opposition for making false allegations
 unhone kaha ki manaregaa ne kaam karne waalon ke liye avasar badha die or mazdooron kii jindagi main ummid kii ek nayi kiran paidaa kii
 'our opponents who are steeped in corruption are accusing us, but they will not tell you that the Congress party brought RTI to eradicate corruption
 ' Sonia said, 'we gave legal protection to the busted people
 ' unhone kaha ki yah sab bhaajapa ko hajam nahin ho rahaa he
 In his rally in Karnataka yesterday, Modi alleged in relation to MNREGA that 'it has only filled the pockets of Congress
 ' gujarat model par hamalaa bolte hue sonia ne aarope lagaaya ki garibon, vanchiton or alpsankhyakon ne paryaapt balidaan die hai tathaa bachche kuposhan se mar rahe hai or adivaasiyon ko jeevanyaapan main mushkilen aa rahi hai
 Land in Gujarat is being forcibly acquired from farmers and women are also facing 'different kinds of problems'
 yahi unki vaastavik tasviir he
 ' unhone kaha, '
 
 ve anekta main ekta main bharosa nahin karte, unhone dilon ko baanta or bhaaiyon ko ek duusare ke khilaaf ladvaya
 Please tell me whether you can expect nation building from people who do not believe in the foundation of our secular principle
