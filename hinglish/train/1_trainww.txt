 Ultimately, the country was liberated from clamor and unprecedented noise
 chunaav prachaar khatm ho gaye hai
 The campaign for this long nine-phase election, which began on 7 April, was also fierce
 chunaav kii avadhi lambii thi to jaahir he prachaar bhi lambey samay tak or jamkar hua
 Surprisingly, despite so many issues, the election campaign kept sacrificing noise and uproar
 kaam kii baaten itani kam hui ki hairaani hoti rahi ki kya hamaare netaaon ke paas muddon kii kami he
 The Congress, which ruled the country for nearly six decades, instead of calling itself an account, was engaged in unnecessary criticism, and the BJP took the same stand
 aam aadmi party jiskaa abhi haal main hi janm hua he, usne bhi koi kasar nahin chodi
 Regional parties like SP, RJD, Trinamool, BSP etc
 did not make any noise
 sabane aise-ese shabd istemaal kiye, virdohi party ke netaaon ko aisi-aisi upamaayen di ki shame se sir jhuk gaya
 It was not felt that we are citizens of a educated country and democracy has been rooted here for more than six decades
 lekin is chunaav ke prachaar ke dauraan to uski chulein hilaane kii puri koshish hui
 There has never been so much noise in the history of India during the campaigning of an election and all parties have made a lot of noise
 chunaav ayog ke niyamon kii dhajjiyaan udaane main kisi ne der nahin lagaai
 Politicians, assassins, murderers, blood thirsty, marauders, donkeys such as shameful metaphors did not halt
 yah shok or dukh kaa vishay he or hamaare loktantr ke bhavishya par prashn chinh lagaataa he
 The amount of venom that our leaders and political parties spew may not have come out of the churning
 sari duniya ne unki chhichhori baaten bhi sunin or apni raay bhi banaai hogi
 Well, the election campaign is over
 sabhi netaa apane-apane ghonslon kii ore ravaanaa ho gaye hai
 Now his voice will not be heard for a few days
 desh main ek shanti failegi jo nihaayat hi jaruri he
 But will any leader or party self-brainstorm what and where it has said the wrong things? It is not new to talk loudly in election campaign but it really embarrasses to fall and talk like this
 baharhaal ummid yahi kii jaani chahie ki is bhayanak shor-sharabe se nikle swaron kaa asar matadaataaon par nahin padaa hoga
 They must have decided to vote independent and the right candidates for a better future away from accusations
 isi main loktantr kii jeet he
 But the question remains, who will teach etiquette to the leaders? jasusi cond main dilli police ko guuruuvaar ko badi kamyaabi hasil hui
 Police have arrested PS of Joint Secretary, Ministry of Environment
 iske saath hi sangh lok seva ayog ke sadsy ke pie ko bhi dilli police ne pakadaa he
 This arrest of big fish has raised many questions
 ye to saaf ho gaya he ki petroleum or duusare mantralayon ke alaava paryaavaran mantralay ke dastavej bhi li hote the
 Jitendra Nagpal, accused of corporate espionage, used to run like this, is PS of Joint Secretary of Ministry of Environment
 giraftaar lokesh ne police ko bataaya tha ki jitendra nagpal ke jariye hi wo dastavej letaa tha
 Jitendra Nagpal used to steal it
 jitendra paryaavaran mantralay main kaam karata tha or lokesh usase ye dastavej lekar duusari companiyon ko bechata tha
 The second arrest in the espionage case is that of a person named Vipin
 vipin sangh lok seva ayog ke sadsy kaa pie he
 Vipin previously worked in the Ministry of Petroleum
 wo petroleum mantralay main apane ek saathi ke jariye dastavej li karwaata tha
 The question then arises whether the departments from which these people have been arrested, what is limited here
 baat hairaan karne vaali he ki ahm or sikret dastavej un logon tak kaise pahunch rahe he
 Those who do not have access to them
 kya daftar se gaayab dastavej kii jimmedaari un mantralay ke bade adhikariyon kii nahin he jahaan se ye gaayab hue hai
 Police officials are not speaking on these questions
 is puure maamle main sabhi giraftaaryaan us str kii ho rahi hai jinka dastavej se koi lenaa dena nahin tha
 Still they find him and disappear
 darasal, is maamle main police ne ab 16 logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 When the police arrested Lokesh
 usase pataa chalaa tha ki wo petroleum or koyala, urja mantralay main apane saathiyon ke jariye dastavej hasil kar unhen apni kannslatent form ke alaava duusare form ko bechata tha
 Now the police can inquire some more people in this matter in the time to come

 lekin kya uske baad kaala dhan bananaa band ho gaya? kya ham yah ummid kar sakate hai ki agle chaar maheenon main iskaa kai guna kaala dhan saamne aayegaa or vitt mantri kaa khazaana labalab hoga
 However, he has insisted that his plan not be compared to the 1997 plan
 donon main koi samanta nahin he
 But why can't there be a law for the collection of black money stashed abroad and black money stashed within the country? Who is being saved and who is benefiting? Black money is being brought or people are being given a chance to turn white! may 2015 main vitt mantri kaala dhan kanoon paas karaane main safal rahe, jiske tahat july se sitambar ke bich videshon main rakhe kaala dhan ke bare main bataa dena tha
 a 90 percent tax and penalty was to be paid for stating within the stipulated time frame and after that, a provision of 10 years in jail has also been made with 120 percent tax and fine if caught
 lekin sitambar ke baad iskar adhikariyon ne is kanoon ke tahat kitnon ko pakadaa or kitna pakadaa isaki koi pukhta jaankaree saarvajanik nahin he
 It is definitely known that between July and September more than 600 people have declared Rs 3770 crore
 is dauraan kulasa karne waalon ko benami act ke praavdhaanon se bhi chhot di gai
 But has the finance minister relented about domestic black money? During June to September, people will disclose their black money and will make white by paying only 45 percent tax, while sixty percent tax and penalty were to be paid for stating black money abroad
 desi kaala dhanakhoron par itani meharbaani kyon
 Is this so much obligatory after a lapse from regular tax payers? It was not clear as to what will be done with those who do not declare domestic black money after September like the black money law
 vitt mantri ne kai maukon par kaha he ki desh ke bheetar bahut badi maatra main kaala dhan he
 Now we do not know whether a large part of it belongs to those people whom we call influential people or also of common people

 During this period, those who were exposed were also exempted from the provisions of the Benami Act
 lekin gharelu kaala dhan ko lekar vitt mantri kya naram hue hai? june se sitambar ke dauraan log apana kaala dhan bataaenge or maatr 45 pratishat kaa kar dekar safed bana lenge jabaki videshon main rakhe kaala dhan bataane par saath fisadi tex or jurmaana dena tha

however, Nitish supported the central government on the issue of GST, but he did Manmohan Singh on this issue Has been demanding to implement GST since the time of

 bihar bijepi ke netaa maanate hai ki guru parv ke aayojan ke liye bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jaise nitish kumaar kii peeth thapthapai usase unki aalochana yaa shrey lene ke kisi tark kii koi gunjaaish nahin bachati, lekin bijepi netaaon kii maane to loksabhaa chunaav main jeet ke baad piem modi ko ummid thi ki vidhansabha chunaav main bhi nitish ko dhul chataane main kaamyaab honge, lekin jab nitish jitkar aa gaye tab uske baad shaayad donon netaaon ko yah abhas hua he ki ek-ek daanv jeet haar ke baad haath mila lene main koi nuksaan nahin haalanki janata dal united ke netaa maanate hai ki nitish ke piem modi se unki raajnneetik dhara ko lekar matbhed rahe hai, jo abhi bhi kaayam hai, lekin rajintik shishtachar ko lekar rajintik atakalein lagane se logon ko bachanaa chahie
 At the same time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is one of the top leaders of BJP, who supported Nitish Kumar's prohibition from public platform
 bhale bihar bijepi ke netaa ab yah daawa karen ki nitish ne gujarat main lagu sharabbandi se prabhavit hokar yah lagu kiya, lekin jaanakar maanate hai ki nitish ke kanoonon kii charchaa gujarat main bhi hoti he or vahaan ke dalit andolan se jude neton ne rajya sarkaar se maang kii he ki bihar kii tarj par sharabbandi kaa kanoon sakht kiya jaae or uske baad gujarat ke adhikariyon ne bihar ke kanoon kaa adhyayan bhi kiya or jamini feedback bhi liya
 PM Modi congratulated Nitish on this issue and gave the advice that this work is not only Nitish Kumar's work but also the people, it adds a new dimension to the relationship
 iske alaava sargical strike ke mudde par nitish kumaar ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa samarthan kiya jo unki sahyogi congress or rashtriya janata dal se alag line thi haalanki nitish ne jiesti ke mudde par bhi centre sarkaar kaa samarthan kiya tha, lekin vah is mudde par manmohan singh ke samay se jiesti ko lagu karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 The comments videshniti ke mudde par bhi nitish modi sarkaar kii aalochana karne se bachate hai or videshniti khaskar pakistan ke prati uthaaye jane vaale kadam ko nitish samarthan dete rahe hai, jisase bhi atakalon kaa bazaar garm rahata he
 Bihar BJP leaders believe that there is no scope for any argument to take criticism or credit from Nitish Kumar for patting him on the back of organizing Guru Parv, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but if BJP leaders believe that victory in Lok Sabha elections After this, PM Modi hoped that Nitish would be able to beat the dust even in the assembly elections, but when Nitish won, then after that maybe both The leaders have come to realize that there is no harm in joining hands after winning each and every bet, although Janata Dal United leaders believe that Nitish has differences with PM Modi regarding his political stream, which still persists , But people should refrain from making political speculation about political etiquette

 For two days, news has been going on the channels that AAP mlas have demanded an increase in salary allowance
 is khabar par charchaa bhi khub chal rahi he, lekin bas raajnneetik angel par charchaa simati hui he or tepe bas yaheen par atka hua he ki is mudde par iskaa kya kahana he yaa is mudde par uskaa kya kahana he
 No one wants to grope according to the ground reality by deeply understanding the issue
 ek tivi channel ke ankar ne sawaal kiya, 'kya aapkaa ghar 83,000 rupee main nahin chalata? ji haa kam se kam ek janpratinidhi kaa to nahin chalata'
 There is no talk of any opposition or support here, but what happened to the journalist who, after covering Delhi at the ground level for years, did not understand the issue and could not explain it? aam aadmi party ke vidhayak saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha ki ek vidhayak ko vetan or bhatte ke taur par kareeb 54,000 rupee milte he or kisi bhi vidhayak kaa kharchaa usase zyada hi he, jitna vetan or bhatta mil rahaa he
 Saurabh tried to explain how the expenditure in Delhi is high and the salary allowance is low
 saurabh ke mutabik yahaan ek offis bhi kholen to 10 se 15 hazaar uskaa kiraaya hota he
 If there is an office in every ward, then you should calculate its expenses
 ab is par bijepi netaa vijendra gupta ne elaan kar diya ki vah ek rupee maheene par kaam karne ko taiyaar hai
 But when i asked him that what you are claiming is not practical
 kya aap bas shigupha to nahin chhod rahe? is par unke paas koi tark aisa nahin tha, jisase lage ki haa yah vyaavhaarik he
 i think you will have the same opinion about this as i was and is
 asal main ham nagarikon ko charchaa karke yah tay karnaa chahie ki vidhayakon kii maang sahi he yaa nahin
 At least you should tell your opinion, because we only have money
 
 
 yah baat sach he ki vidhayakon ke paas jane par aapaki samasya kaa samaadhaan ho yaa naa ho, jahaan tak maine dekha he chaay to har vidhayak ke daftar main jane par aapako mil hi jaati he
 Think a tea contains milk, tea leaves, sugar and gas costs, and if sourced from outside, a tea will cost Rs 7-8
 agar 30-35 chaay rozaana pilaane kaa vidhayak daftar kaa ausat maane, to bhi maheene main 1000 chaay kaa kharchaa saat se aath hazaar ho jaataa he
 While sitting in the mla's office, we do not think while drinking that this is also an expense
 kya ham tay karen ki aaj ke baad kisi vidhayak ke daftar main ham chaay kii ummid nahin karenge or agar usne khud bhi chaay pilaane kii peshkash to ham inkaar denge? The MLA has to do office rent, office staff which you always get in the office, electricity and water expenses in opening an office
 agar ham kam se kam bhi maanakar chalem to ek ladkaa offis main hameshaa tainaat rakhane main kam se kam se 10,000 to dene honge hi or offis kaa kiraaya, bijli pani kaa bill bhi kam se kam 10,000 har haal main hoga hi
 So only one office cost was at least 20 thousand rupees a month
 agar har ward main ek offis kholana pad jaae to chaar ward ke hisaab se 80,000 rupee to ye ho gaye
 Should we tell our MLA that one office is enough in our assembly constituency, we do not want another office
 hamako zarurat hogi to bhale hi thodaa dur pade ham aapke offis aaenge, aap chaar daftar naa kholen? or faaltu kaa kharchaa naa karen, kyonki inkaa kharchaa hamane hi dena he
 It is also true of Saurabh Bhardwaj that 4-5 weddings are also attended daily in a season, then we attended 200 marriages throughout the season and we also gave at least 500 rupees in a wedding in Kanyadaan and this is one lakh rupees
 Have become
 kisi bhi vidhayak ko log apane yahaan shaadi main bulaanaa chaahate hai or vidhayak bhi har shaadi main zarur jaataa he, kyonki vah uske voter kii shaadi he uske padosi kii shaadi he
 Now no man goes to the wedding empty-handed and many people keep an eye on what the leaders gave and how much they gave at the wedding
 to kam se kam 500 rupee aap har shaadi main ausat kanyadan bhi denge to lakh rupee kharchaa yahi hoga
 Should we decide that we will call our MLA, but we will not take anything from him or say that while giving the card, you are expected to come here with your family and blessings and take the gift of good relations with us
 Go
 iske alaava na aap kuch dijiega or naa ham lenge
 Can we do that? asal main aaj ye sochane kaa vakt he ki ham apane vidhayak se kya chaahate hai or kis tarah chaahate hai
 It is also necessary to mention here that the financial condition of every MLA is not the same
 kuch vidhayak to aise hai jinke paas pehle se apana vyapaar hota he or aise vidhayak vetan badhaane kii maang main zyaada dilchaspee nahin lete
 However, there are some mlas from Delhi who do not have any other source of income and are working only with salary allowance as an MLA
 yah log hi maang kar rahe hai ki itane vetan bhatte main kaam nahin chal rahaa or isko badhaayaa jaae
 To put it a little more openly, according to me, Naresh Balian, an AAP MLA from Uttam Nagar, is financially prosperous, so i do not think his salary allowance should be increased
 lekin rohtash nagar kii vidhayak sarita singh aarthik rup se sampann nahin hai, kyonki vah anna andolan se sidhaa raajnneeti main aa gayi
 mlas like Sarita are finding it difficult to work in this salary allowance
 ab kyonki vidhayakon kii aarthik sthiti yaa sampannataa ek jaisi nahin he or isliye sansaadhan bhi sabake paas ek se nahin hai, to kyon naa ek aise formule par vichaar kiya jaae, jisase aarthik rup se kamazor vidhayak kii madad ho sake or janata ke paise kaa bhi sahi istemaal ho
 However, increasing the salary allowance is not the only option and cannot be, because one truth is that the salary allowance of a legislator or yours and mine is always low and it does not work
 isliye kuch nayaa sochaa jaae, taaki system main kuch to badale
 The comments vidhayakon kaa vetan bhatta saal 2007 or 2011 main bhi badha tha or ab 2015 main bhi maang ho rahi he, lekin kuch system to dikhe jisase lage haa itnaa vetan bhatta dena thik he yaa tarksangat he or vaazib he
 Because do not forget that this is the money of the public and the public is watching
 haalanki mere hisaab se aam aadmi party kii sarkaar abhi nai ai he or logon ko isse bahut ummiden hai, isliye agar kuch samay baad is tarah kii maang uthati, thodaa or kaam vidhayak or sarkaar janata ko dikhaate or phir aisi maang karte to acha hota, lekin phir bhi agar maang he to charchaa to zarur honi chahie or phir jo sahi lage vah karnaa chahie
 No one wants to grope according to the ground reality by deeply understanding the issue
 ek tivi channel ke ankar ne sawaal kiya, 'kya aapkaa ghar 83,000 rupee main nahin chalata? ji haa kam se kam ek janpratinidhi kaa to nahin chalata'
 There is no talk of any opposition or support here, but what happened to the journalist who, after covering Delhi at the ground level for years, did not understand the issue and could not explain it? aam aadmi party ke vidhayak saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha ki ek vidhayak ko vetan or bhatte ke taur par kareeb 54,000 rupee milte he or kisi bhi vidhayak kaa kharchaa usase zyada hi he, jitna vetan or bhatta mil rahaa he
 Saurabh tried to explain how the expenditure in Delhi is high and the salary allowance is low
 saurabh ke mutabik yahaan ek offis bhi kholen to 10 se 15 hazaar uskaa kiraaya hota he
 If there is an office in every ward, then you should calculate its expenses
 ab is par bijepi netaa vijendra gupta ne elaan kar diya ki vah ek rupee maheene par kaam karne ko taiyaar hai
 But when i asked him that what you are claiming is not practical
 kya aap bas shigupha to nahin chhod rahe? is par unke paas koi tark aisa nahin tha, jisase lage ki haa yah vyaavhaarik he
 i think you will have the same opinion about this as i was and is
 asal main ham nagarikon ko charchaa karke yah tay karnaa chahie ki vidhayakon kii maang sahi he yaa nahin
 At least you should tell your opinion, because we only have money
 
 
 yah baat sach he ki vidhayakon ke paas jane par aapaki samasya kaa samaadhaan ho yaa naa ho, jahaan tak maine dekha he chaay to har vidhayak ke daftar main jane par aapako mil hi jaati he
 Think a tea contains milk, tea leaves, sugar and gas costs, and if sourced from outside, a tea will cost Rs 7-8
 agar 30-35 chaay rozaana pilaane kaa vidhayak daftar kaa ausat maane, to bhi maheene main 1000 chaay kaa kharchaa saat se aath hazaar ho jaataa he
 While sitting in the mla's office, we do not think while drinking that this is also an expense
 kya ham tay karen ki aaj ke baad kisi vidhayak ke daftar main ham chaay kii ummid nahin karenge or agar usne khud bhi chaay pilaane kii peshkash to ham inkaar denge? The MLA has to do office rent, office staff which you always get in the office, electricity and water expenses in opening an office
 agar ham kam se kam bhi maanakar chalem to ek ladkaa offis main hameshaa tainaat rakhane main kam se kam se 10,000 to dene honge hi or offis kaa kiraaya, bijli pani kaa bill bhi kam se kam 10,000 har haal main hoga hi
 So only one office cost was at least 20 thousand rupees a month
 agar har ward main ek offis kholana pad jaae to chaar ward ke hisaab se 80,000 rupee to ye ho gaye
 Should we tell our MLA that one office is enough in our assembly constituency, we do not want another office
 hamako zarurat hogi to bhale hi thodaa dur pade ham aapke offis aaenge, aap chaar daftar naa kholen? or faaltu kaa kharchaa naa karen, kyonki inkaa kharchaa hamane hi dena he
 It is also true of Saurabh Bhardwaj that 4-5 weddings are also attended daily in a season, then we attended 200 marriages throughout the season and we also gave at least 500 rupees in a wedding in Kanyadaan and this is one lakh rupees
 Have become
 kisi bhi vidhayak ko log apane yahaan shaadi main bulaanaa chaahate hai or vidhayak bhi har shaadi main zarur jaataa he, kyonki vah uske voter kii shaadi he uske padosi kii shaadi he
 Now no man goes to the wedding empty-handed and many people keep an eye on what the leaders gave and how much they gave at the wedding
 to kam se kam 500 rupee aap har shaadi main ausat kanyadan bhi denge to lakh rupee kharchaa yahi hoga
 Should we decide that we will call our MLA, but we will not take anything from him or say that while giving the card, you are expected to come here with your family and blessings and take the gift of good relations with us
 Go
 iske alaava na aap kuch dijiega or naa ham lenge
 Can we do that? asal main aaj ye sochane kaa vakt he ki ham apane vidhayak se kya chaahate hai or kis tarah chaahate hai
 It is also necessary to mention here that the financial condition of every MLA is not the same
 kuch vidhayak to aise hai jinke paas pehle se apana vyapaar hota he or aise vidhayak vetan badhaane kii maang main zyaada dilchaspee nahin lete
 However, there are some mlas from Delhi who do not have any other source of income and are working only with salary allowance as an MLA
 yah log hi maang kar rahe hai ki itane vetan bhatte main kaam nahin chal rahaa or isko badhaayaa jaae
 To put it a little more openly, according to me, Naresh Balian, an AAP MLA from Uttam Nagar, is financially prosperous, so i do not think his salary allowance should be increased
 lekin rohtash nagar kii vidhayak sarita singh aarthik rup se sampann nahin hai, kyonki vah anna andolan se sidhaa raajnneeti main aa gayi
 mlas like Sarita are finding it difficult to work in this salary allowance
 ab kyonki vidhayakon kii aarthik sthiti yaa sampannataa ek jaisi nahin he or isliye sansaadhan bhi sabake paas ek se nahin hai, to kyon naa ek aise formule par vichaar kiya jaae, jisase aarthik rup se kamazor vidhayak kii madad ho sake or janata ke paise kaa bhi sahi istemaal ho
 However, increasing the salary allowance is not the only option and cannot be, because one truth is that the salary allowance of a legislator or yours and mine is always low and it does not work
 isliye kuch nayaa sochaa jaae, taaki system main kuch to badale
 The comments vidhayakon kaa vetan bhatta saal 2007 or 2011 main bhi badha tha or ab 2015 main bhi maang ho rahi he, lekin kuch system to dikhe jisase lage haa itnaa vetan bhatta dena thik he yaa tarksangat he or vaazib he
 Because do not forget that this is the money of the public and the public is watching
 haalanki mere hisaab se aam aadmi party kii sarkaar abhi nai ai he or logon ko isse bahut ummiden hai, isliye agar kuch samay baad is tarah kii maang uthati, thodaa or kaam vidhayak or sarkaar janata ko dikhaate or phir aisi maang karte to acha hota, lekin phir bhi agar maang he to charchaa to zarur honi chahie or phir jo sahi lage vah karnaa chahie

 Aam Aadmi Party MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj said that an MLA gets around 54,000 rupees as salary and allowance and the cost of any MLA is more than that of salary and allowance
 saurabh ne samajhane kii koshish kii ki dilli main kaise kharchaa zyada he or vetan bhatta kam
 According to Saurabh, if you open an office here, then it is 10 to 15 thousand
 agar har ward main offis ho to uske kharch kaa aap hisaab laga len
 Now BJP leader Vijendra Gupta announced that he is ready to work on one rupee a month
 lekin jab maine unase poocha ki aap jo ye daawa kar rahe hai, vah vyaavhaarik nahin he
 Are you just not leaving Shigufa? He did not have any argument on this, which would indicate that yes it is practical
 mujhe lagata he is bare main aapaki bhi vahi raay hogi jo meri thi or he
 Actually we citizens should discuss and decide whether the demand of mlas is right or not
 kam se kam apana mat to bataanaa hi chahie, kyonki paisa to ham logon kaa hi he naa
 
 
 It is true that your problem may or may not be solved by going to the mlas, as far as i have seen, tea is available to every mla's office
 sochie ek chaay main doodh, chaay kii pattee, chini or gas kaa kharchaa shaamil he or agar baahar se bhi mangaaye to ek chaay 7-8 rupee kii to pad hi jaaegi
 Even if the MLA considers the average of the office of 30–30 teas a day, the cost of 1000 teas is seven to eight thousand a month
 vidhayak ke daftar main baithkar ham pite vaqt nahin sochate ki ye bhi kharch hi he
 Should we decide that after today, we will not expect tea in any mla's office and if he himself offers to drink tea then we will refuse? vidhayak ko ek offis kholane main offis kaa kiraaya, offis staff jo aapako hameshaa offis main mili, bijli-pani kaa kharchaa ye sab vahaan karnaa hota he
 If we go at least as well, then a boy will always have to pay at least 10,000 to keep him posted in the office and the office rent, electricity water bill will also be at least 10,000
 to keval ek offis kaa kharchaa kam se kam 20 hazaar rupee maheenaa hua
 If an office was to be opened in every ward, then it was Rs 80,000 according to four wards
 kya ham apane vidhayak ko kahen ki bhai hamaare vidhansabha kshetra main ek hi offis kaaphi he, hamako doosraa offis nahin chahie
 If we need, even if we are a little far away, we will come to your office, don't you open four offices? And do not spend extravagantly, because we only have to pay for them
 saurabh bharadwaj kii yah baat bhi haqiqat he ki ek sijan main rozaana 4-5 shaadi bhi atend kii to 200 shaadi puure sijan main hamane atend kar lee or kam se kam 500 rupee bhi hamane kanyadan main ek shaadi main die to ek lakh rupee to yahi ho gaye
 People want to invite any MLA to their wedding and the MLA also attends every wedding, because it is the wedding of his voter, his neighbor's wedding
 ab khaali haath to koi bhi aadmi shaadi main nahin jaataa or netaaon ne shaadi main kya diya or kitna diya is par bahut se logon kii nazar rahati he
 If you give at least 500 rupees for every wedding, you will also spend Rs
 kya ham tay karen ki ham apane vidhayak ko bulaayenge to zarur, lekin uskaa diya kuch nahin lenge yaa card dete vaqt hi kah denge ki aapse ummid he ki aap hamaare yahaan apane parivaar or aashirwad ke saath aaen or achche-achche sambandhon kaa uphaar hamase le jaaen
 Apart from this, neither you will give anything nor we will take it
 kya ham aisa kar sakate hai? Actually today is the time to think about what we want and how we want from our MLA
 yahaan yah bhi bataanaa jaruri ho jaataa he ki har vidhayak kii aarthik haalat ek si nahin hoti
 There are some mlas who already have their own business and such mlas are not much interested in the demand for salary increase
 haalanki dilli ke kuch vidhayak aise bhi hai, jinke paas aay kaa koi doosraa strot nahin he or vidhayak ke taur par milane vaale vetan bhatte se hi kaam chalaa rahe hai
 These people are demanding that work is not going on in this salary allowance and it should be increased
 thodaa or is baat ko khulkar kahuun to ki mere hisaab se uttam nagar se AAP ke vidhayak naresh baalion aarthik rup se sampann hai, isliye mujhe nahin lagata ki inkaa vetan bhatta badhanaa chahie
 But Rohitash Nagar MLA Sarita Singh is not financially prosperous, as she got directly into politics from Anna movement
 sarita jaise vidhayakon kaa hi is vetan bhatte main kaam chalanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Now, because the economic status or prosperity of the mlas is not the same and therefore not everyone has the same resources, why not consider a formula that can help the economically weaker MLA and also the money of the public
 Be used properly haalanki vetan bhatta badha dena koi ekmaatr vikalp nahin he or naa ho saktaa he, kyonki ek sach yah bhi he ki vetan bhatta to kisi vidhayak kaa ho yaa aapkaa or meraa vah hameshaa hi kam lagata he or utane main kaam nahin chalata he
 So think of something new, so that something changes in the system
 tippaniyan The salary allowance of the mlas was also increased in the years 2007 and 2011 and now there is a demand in 2015, but some systems may appear that yes it is okay or reasonable to give such salary allowance and it is reasonable
 kyonki ye naa bhoolen ki ye janata kaa paisa he or janata sab dekh rahi he
 However, according to me, the Aam Aadmi Party government has just arrived and people have high expectations from it, so if after some time such a demand would arise, it would have been good if the MLA and the government would have shown a little more work and then made such demand
 But even if there is a demand, then there must be a discussion and then do what is right
 saurabh ne samajhane kii koshish kii ki dilli main kaise kharchaa zyada he or vetan bhatta kam
 According to Saurabh, if you open an office here, then it is 10 to 15 thousand

 ab is par bijepi netaa vijendra gupta ne elaan kar diya ki vah ek rupee maheene par kaam karne ko taiyaar hai
 But when i asked him that what you are claiming is not practical
 kya aap bas shigupha to nahin chhod rahe? is par unke paas koi tark aisa nahin tha, jisase lage ki haa yah vyaavhaarik he
 i think you will have the same opinion about this as i was and is
 asal main ham nagarikon ko charchaa karke yah tay karnaa chahie ki vidhayakon kii maang sahi he yaa nahin
 At least you should tell your opinion, because we only have money
 
 
 yah baat sach he ki vidhayakon ke paas jane par aapaki samasya kaa samaadhaan ho yaa naa ho, jahaan tak maine dekha he chaay to har vidhayak ke daftar main jane par aapako mil hi jaati he
 Think a tea contains milk, tea leaves, sugar and gas costs, and if sourced from outside, a tea will cost Rs 7-8
 agar 30-35 chaay rozaana pilaane kaa vidhayak daftar kaa ausat maane, to bhi maheene main 1000 chaay kaa kharchaa saat se aath hazaar ho jaataa he
 While sitting in the mla's office, we do not think while drinking that this is also an expense
 kya ham tay karen ki aaj ke baad kisi vidhayak ke daftar main ham chaay kii ummid nahin karenge or agar usne khud bhi chaay pilaane kii peshkash to ham inkaar denge? The MLA has to do office rent, office staff which you always get in the office, electricity and water expenses in opening an office
 agar ham kam se kam bhi maanakar chalem to ek ladkaa offis main hameshaa tainaat rakhane main kam se kam se 10,000 to dene honge hi or offis kaa kiraaya, bijli pani kaa bill bhi kam se kam 10,000 har haal main hoga hi
 So only one office cost was at least 20 thousand rupees a month
 agar har ward main ek offis kholana pad jaae to chaar ward ke hisaab se 80,000 rupee to ye ho gaye
 Should we tell our MLA that one office is enough in our assembly constituency, we do not want another office
 hamako zarurat hogi to bhale hi thodaa dur pade ham aapke offis aaenge, aap chaar daftar naa kholen? or faaltu kaa kharchaa naa karen, kyonki inkaa kharchaa hamane hi dena he
 It is also true of Saurabh Bhardwaj that 4-5 weddings are also attended daily in a season, then we attended 200 marriages throughout the season and we also gave at least 500 rupees in a wedding in Kanyadaan and this is one lakh rupees
 Have become
 kisi bhi vidhayak ko log apane yahaan shaadi main bulaanaa chaahate hai or vidhayak bhi har shaadi main zarur jaataa he, kyonki vah uske voter kii shaadi he uske padosi kii shaadi he
 Now no man goes to the wedding empty-handed and many people keep an eye on what the leaders gave and how much they gave at the wedding
 to kam se kam 500 rupee aap har shaadi main ausat kanyadan bhi denge to lakh rupee kharchaa yahi hoga
 Should we decide that we will call our MLA, but we will not take anything from him or say that while giving the card, you are expected to come here with your family and blessings and take the gift of good relations with us
 Go
 iske alaava na aap kuch dijiega or naa ham lenge
 Can we do that? asal main aaj ye sochane kaa vakt he ki ham apane vidhayak se kya chaahate hai or kis tarah chaahate hai
 It is also necessary to mention here that the financial condition of every MLA is not the same
 kuch vidhayak to aise hai jinke paas pehle se apana vyapaar hota he or aise vidhayak vetan badhaane kii maang main zyaada dilchaspee nahin lete
 However, there are some mlas of Delhi who do not have any other source of income and are working only with salary allowance as an MLA 
 yah log hi maang kar rahe hai ki itane vetan bhatte main kaam nahin chal rahaa or isko badhaayaa jaae
 To put it a little more openly, according to me, Naresh Balian, an AAP MLA from Uttam Nagar, is financially prosperous, so i do not think his salary allowance should be increased
 lekin rohtash nagar kii vidhayak sarita singh aarthik rup se sampann nahin hai, kyonki vah anna andolan se sidhaa raajnneeti main aa gayi
 mlas like Sarita are finding it difficult to work in this salary allowance
 ab kyonki vidhayakon kii aarthik sthiti yaa sampannataa ek jaisi nahin he or isliye sansaadhan bhi sabake paas ek se nahin hai, to kyon naa ek aise formule par vichaar kiya jaae, jisase aarthik rup se kamazor vidhayak kii madad ho sake or janata ke paise kaa bhi sahi istemaal ho
 However, increasing the salary allowance is not the only option and cannot be, because one truth is that the salary allowance of a legislator or yours and mine is always low and it does not work
 isliye kuch nayaa sochaa jaae, taaki system main kuch to badale
 The comments vidhayakon kaa vetan bhatta saal 2007 or 2011 main bhi badha tha or ab 2015 main bhi maang ho rahi he, lekin kuch system to dikhe jisase lage haa itnaa vetan bhatta dena thik he yaa tarksangat he or vaazib he
 Because do not forget that this is the money of the public and the public is watching
 haalanki mere hisaab se aam aadmi party kii sarkaar abhi nai ai he or logon ko isse bahut ummiden hai, isliye agar kuch samay baad is tarah kii maang uthati, thodaa or kaam vidhayak or sarkaar janata ko dikhaate or phir aisi maang karte to acha hota, lekin phir bhi agar maang he to charchaa to zarur honi chahie or phir jo sahi lage vah karnaa chahie
 Actually we citizens should discuss and decide whether the demand of mlas is right or not
 kam se kam apana mat to bataanaa hi chahie, kyonki paisa to ham logon kaa hi he naa
 
 
 It is true that your problem may or may not be solved by going to the mlas, as far as i have seen, tea is available to every mla's office
 sochie ek chaay main doodh, chaay kii pattee, chini or gas kaa kharchaa shaamil he or agar baahar se bhi mangaaye to ek chaay 7-8 rupee kii to pad hi jaaegi
 Even if the MLA considers the average of the office of 30–30 teas a day, the cost of 1000 teas is seven to eight thousand a month
 vidhayak ke daftar main baithkar ham pite vaqt nahin sochate ki ye bhi kharch hi he
 Should we decide that after today, we will not expect tea in any mla's office and if he himself offers to drink tea then we will refuse? vidhayak ko ek offis kholane main offis kaa kiraaya, offis staff jo aapako hameshaa offis main mili, bijli-pani kaa kharchaa ye sab vahaan karnaa hota he
 If we go at least as well, then a boy will always have to pay at least 10,000 to keep him posted in the office and the office rent, electricity water bill will also be at least 10,000
 to keval ek offis kaa kharchaa kam se kam 20 hazaar rupee maheenaa hua
 If an office was to be opened in every ward, then it was Rs 80,000 according to four wards
 kya ham apane vidhayak ko kahen ki bhai hamaare vidhansabha kshetra main ek hi offis kaaphi he, hamako doosraa offis nahin chahie
 If we need, even if we are a little far away, we will come to your office, don't you open four offices? And do not spend extravagantly, because we only have to pay for them
 saurabh bharadwaj kii yah baat bhi haqiqat he ki ek sijan main rozaana 4-5 shaadi bhi atend kii to 200 shaadi puure sijan main hamane atend kar lee or kam se kam 500 rupee bhi hamane kanyadan main ek shaadi main die to ek lakh rupee to yahi ho gaye
 People want to invite any MLA to their wedding and the MLA also attends every wedding, because it is the wedding of his voter, his neighbor's wedding
 ab khaali haath to koi bhi aadmi shaadi main nahin jaataa or netaaon ne shaadi main kya diya or kitna diya is par bahut se logon kii nazar rahati he
 If you give at least 500 rupees for every wedding, you will also spend Rs
 kya ham tay karen ki ham apane vidhayak ko bulaayenge to zarur, lekin uskaa diya kuch nahin lenge yaa card dete vaqt hi kah denge ki aapse ummid he ki aap hamaare yahaan apane parivaar or aashirwad ke saath aaen or achche-achche sambandhon kaa uphaar hamase le jaaen
 Apart from this, neither you will give anything nor we will take it
 kya ham aisa kar sakate hai? Actually today is the time to think about what we want and how we want from our MLA
 yahaan yah bhi bataanaa jaruri ho jaataa he ki har vidhayak kii aarthik haalat ek si nahin hoti
 There are some mlas who already have their own business and such mlas are not much interested in the demand for salary increase
 haalanki dilli ke kuch vidhayak aise bhi hai, jinke paas aay kaa koi doosraa strot nahin he or vidhayak ke taur par milane vaale vetan bhatte se hi kaam chalaa rahe hai
 These people are demanding that work is not going on in this salary allowance and it should be increased
 thodaa or is baat ko khulkar kahuun to ki mere hisaab se uttam nagar se AAP ke vidhayak naresh baalion aarthik rup se sampann hai, isliye mujhe nahin lagata ki inkaa vetan bhatta badhanaa chahie
 But Rohitash Nagar MLA Sarita Singh is not financially prosperous, as she got directly into politics from Anna movement
 sarita jaise vidhayakon kaa hi is vetan bhatte main kaam chalanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Now, because the economic status or prosperity of the mlas is not the same and therefore not everyone has the same resources, why not consider a formula that can help the economically weaker MLA and also the money of the public
 Be used properly haalanki vetan bhatta badha dena koi ekmaatr vikalp nahin he or naa ho saktaa he, kyonki ek sach yah bhi he ki vetan bhatta to kisi vidhayak kaa ho yaa aapkaa or meraa vah hameshaa hi kam lagata he or utane main kaam nahin chalata he
 So think of something new, so that something changes in the system
 tippaniyan The salary allowance of the mlas was also increased in the years 2007 and 2011 and now there is a demand in 2015, but some systems may appear that yes it is okay or reasonable to give such salary allowance and it is reasonable
 kyonki ye naa bhoolen ki ye janata kaa paisa he or janata sab dekh rahi he
 However, according to me, the Aam Aadmi Party government has just arrived and people have high expectations from it, so if after some time such a demand would arise, it would have been good if the MLA and the government would have shown a little more work and then made such demand
 But even if there is a demand, then there must be a discussion and then do what is right
 yah baat sach he ki vidhayakon ke paas jane par aapaki samasya kaa samaadhaan ho yaa naa ho, jahaan tak maine dekha he chaay to har vidhayak ke daftar main jane par aapako mil hi jaati he
 Think a tea contains milk, tea leaves, sugar and gas costs, and if sourced from outside, a tea will cost Rs 7-8
 agar 30-35 chaay rozaana pilaane kaa vidhayak daftar kaa ausat maane, to bhi maheene main 1000 chaay kaa kharchaa saat se aath hazaar ho jaataa he
 While sitting in the mla's office, we do not think while drinking that this is also an expense
 kya ham tay karen ki aaj ke baad kisi vidhayak ke daftar main ham chaay kii ummid nahin karenge or agar usne khud bhi chaay pilaane kii peshkash to ham inkaar denge? The MLA has to do office rent, office staff which you always get in the office, electricity and water expenses in opening an office
 agar ham kam se kam bhi maanakar chalem to ek ladkaa offis main hameshaa tainaat rakhane main kam se kam se 10,000 to dene honge hi or offis kaa kiraaya, bijli pani kaa bill bhi kam se kam 10,000 har haal main hoga hi
 So only one office cost was at least 20 thousand rupees a month
 agar har ward main ek offis kholana pad jaae to chaar ward ke hisaab se 80,000 rupee to ye ho gaye
 Should we tell our MLA that one office is enough in our assembly constituency, we do not want another office
 hamako zarurat hogi to bhale hi thodaa dur pade ham aapke offis aaenge, aap chaar daftar naa kholen? or faaltu kaa kharchaa naa karen, kyonki inkaa kharchaa hamane hi dena he
 It is also true of Saurabh Bhardwaj that 4-5 weddings are also attended daily in a season, then we attended 200 marriages throughout the season and we also gave at least 500 rupees in a wedding in Kanyadaan and this is one lakh rupees
 Have become
 kisi bhi vidhayak ko log apane yahaan shaadi main bulaanaa chaahate hai or vidhayak bhi har shaadi main zarur jaataa he, kyonki vah uske voter kii shaadi he uske padosi kii shaadi he
 Now no man goes to the wedding empty-handed and many people keep an eye on what the leaders gave and how much they gave at the wedding
 to kam se kam 500 rupee aap har shaadi main ausat kanyadan bhi denge to lakh rupee kharchaa yahi hoga
 Should we decide that we will call our MLA, but we will not take anything from him or say that while giving the card, you are expected to come here with your family and blessings and take the gift of good relations with us
 Go
 iske alaava na aap kuch dijiega or naa ham lenge
 Can we do that? asal main aaj ye sochane kaa vakt he ki ham apane vidhayak se kya chaahate hai or kis tarah chaahate hai
 It is also necessary to mention here that the financial condition of every MLA is not the same
 kuch vidhayak to aise hai jinke paas pehle se apana vyapaar hota he or aise vidhayak vetan badhaane kii maang main zyaada dilchaspee nahin lete
 However, there are some mlas from Delhi who do not have any other source of income and are working only with salary allowance as an MLA
 yah log hi maang kar rahe hai ki itane vetan bhatte main kaam nahin chal rahaa or isko badhaayaa jaae
 To put it a little more openly, according to me, Naresh Balian, an AAP MLA from Uttam Nagar, is financially prosperous, so i do not think his salary allowance should be increased
 lekin rohtash nagar kii vidhayak sarita singh aarthik rup se sampann nahin hai, kyonki vah anna andolan se sidhaa raajnneeti main aa gayi
 mlas like Sarita are finding it difficult to work in this salary allowance
 ab kyonki vidhayakon kii aarthik sthiti yaa sampannataa ek jaisi nahin he or isliye sansaadhan bhi sabake paas ek se nahin hai, to kyon naa ek aise formule par vichaar kiya jaae, jisase aarthik rup se kamazor vidhayak kii madad ho sake or janata ke paise kaa bhi sahi istemaal ho
 However, increasing the salary allowance is not the only option and cannot be, because one truth is that the salary allowance of a legislator or yours and mine is always low and it does not work
 isliye kuch nayaa sochaa jaae, taaki system main kuch to badale
 The comments vidhayakon kaa vetan bhatta saal 2007 or 2011 main bhi badha tha or ab 2015 main bhi maang ho rahi he, lekin kuch system to dikhe jisase lage haa itnaa vetan bhatta dena thik he yaa tarksangat he or vaazib he

 Apart from this, neither you will give anything nor we will take it
 kya ham aisa kar sakate hai? Actually today is the time to think about what we want and how we want from our MLA
 yahaan yah bhi bataanaa jaruri ho jaataa he ki har vidhayak kii aarthik haalat ek si nahin hoti
 There are some mlas who already have their own business and such mlas are not much interested in the demand for salary increase
 haalanki dilli ke kuch vidhayak aise bhi hai, jinke paas aay kaa koi doosraa strot nahin he or vidhayak ke taur par milane vaale vetan bhatte se hi kaam chalaa rahe hai
 These people are demanding that work is not going on in this salary allowance and it should be increased
 thodaa or is baat ko khulkar kahuun to ki mere hisaab se uttam nagar se AAP ke vidhayak naresh baalion aarthik rup se sampann hai, isliye mujhe nahin lagata ki inkaa vetan bhatta badhanaa chahie
 But Rohitash Nagar MLA Sarita Singh is not financially prosperous, as she got directly into politics from Anna movement
 sarita jaise vidhayakon kaa hi is vetan bhatte main kaam chalanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Now, because the economic status or prosperity of the mlas is not the same and therefore not everyone has the same resources, why not consider a formula that can help the economically weaker MLA and also the money of the public
 Be used properly haalanki vetan bhatta badha dena koi ekmaatr vikalp nahin he or naa ho saktaa he, kyonki ek sach yah bhi he ki vetan bhatta to kisi vidhayak kaa ho yaa aapkaa or meraa vah hameshaa hi kam lagata he or utane main kaam nahin chalata he
 So think of something new, so that something changes in the system
 tippaniyan The salary allowance of the mlas was also increased in the years 2007 and 2011 and now there is a demand in 2015, but some systems may appear that yes it is okay or reasonable to give such salary allowance and it is reasonable
 kyonki ye naa bhoolen ki ye janata kaa paisa he or janata sab dekh rahi he
 However, according to me, the Aam Aadmi Party government has just arrived and people have high expectations from it, so if after some time such a demand would arise, it would have been good if the MLA and the government would have shown a little more work and then made such demand
 But even if there is a demand, then there must be a discussion and then do what is right
 asal main aaj ye sochane kaa vakt he ki ham apane vidhayak se kya chaahate hai or kis tarah chaahate hai
 It is also necessary to mention here that the financial condition of every MLA is not the same
 kuch vidhayak to aise hai jinke paas pehle se apana vyapaar hota he or aise vidhayak vetan badhaane kii maang main zyaada dilchaspee nahin lete
 However, there are some mlas from Delhi who do not have any other source of income and are working only with salary allowance as an MLA
 yah log hi maang kar rahe hai ki itane vetan bhatte main kaam nahin chal rahaa or isko badhaayaa jaae
 To put it a little more openly, according to me, Naresh Balian, an AAP MLA from Uttam Nagar, is financially prosperous, so i do not think his salary allowance should be increased
 lekin rohtash nagar kii vidhayak sarita singh aarthik rup se sampann nahin hai, kyonki vah anna andolan se sidhaa raajnneeti main aa gayi
 mlas like Sarita are finding it difficult to work in this salary allowance
 ab kyonki vidhayakon kii aarthik sthiti yaa sampannataa ek jaisi nahin he or isliye sansaadhan bhi sabake paas ek se nahin hai, to kyon naa ek aise formule par vichaar kiya jaae, jisase aarthik rup se kamazor vidhayak kii madad ho sake or janata ke paise kaa bhi sahi istemaal ho
 However, increasing the salary allowance is not the only option and cannot be, because one truth is that the salary allowance of a legislator or yours and mine is always low and it does not work
 isliye kuch nayaa sochaa jaae, taaki system main kuch to badale
 The comments vidhayakon kaa vetan bhatta saal 2007 or 2011 main bhi badha tha or ab 2015 main bhi maang ho rahi he, lekin kuch system to dikhe jisase lage haa itnaa vetan bhatta dena thik he yaa tarksangat he or vaazib he
 Because do not forget that this is the money of the public and the public is watching
 haalanki mere hisaab se aam aadmi party kii sarkaar abhi nai ai he or logon ko isse bahut ummiden hai, isliye agar kuch samay baad is tarah kii maang uthati, thodaa or kaam vidhayak or sarkaar janata ko dikhaate or phir aisi maang karte to acha hota, lekin phir bhi agar maang he to charchaa to zarur honi chahie or phir jo sahi lage vah karnaa chahie

 in the corruption case
 chidambaram ke bete karti chidambaram ko sibiai ne talab kiya he
 Karti has been called for questioning on 21 July
 sibiai ne videshi nivesh protsaahan board (FIPB) manjuuri se jude ek maamle main poochtacha ke liye karti ko bulaayaa he
 It is alleged that when Karthi's father P
W
 chidambaram vitt mantri the, tab morishas se dhan praapt karne ke liye media samooh ienex media ko yah manjuuri di gai thi
 It is alleged that Karthi obtained money from INX Media to use his influence to manipulate an ongoing tax investigation against him for violating the terms of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board to obtain investment from Mauritius
 sibiai ke 10 lakh rape ke vauchar bhi mili the jo sevaaon ke badale kathith rup se die gaye the
 The CBI had alleged that these vouchers were given to Advantage Strategic Consulting Private Limited
 is company par paroksh rup se karti kaa swaamitv he
 CBI sources said that he was summoned earlier in June as well, but Karti had sought deferment to appear before the investigating agency
 sibiai ne aarope lagaaya ki unke apratyaksh niyantran vaali ek company ne ienex media se dhan liya tha
 INX Media Group was run by Indrani and Peter Mukherjee
 chidambaram ne bataae the bebuniyaad aropcongress netaa pi
 Chidambaram issued a strong statement against the FIR, saying that the government was using the CBI and other investigative agencies to target his son
 chidambaram ne kaha tha ki FIPB kii manjuuri hajaaron maamalon main di gai
 These approvals are given by the five secretaries on the FIPB board
 unamem se kisi ke upar koi aarope nahin he
 There is no charge against me
 maharashtra main bijepi-shivasena ke bich aapasi vivaad badhata hi ja rahaa he
 CM Devendra Fadnavis has given an open statement on the speculation of mid-term elections in the state
 unhone kaha- bijepi rajya main madhyavadhi chunaav ke liye taiyaar he
 Explain that amidst the farmer movement, the Shiv Sena has threatened to withdraw support from the government
 fadanvis ne kya kaha?ek din pehle dilli ke daure par aae maharashtra ke siem ne kaha- agar koi sarkaar ko asthir karne kii dhamkee de rahaa he to ham log madhyavadhi chunaav ke liye taiyaar hai
 We will try our best to make BJP emerge as the largest party in the state
 shivasena ne kya kaha tha?haal hi main, shivasena ke netaa sanjay raut ne kaha tha ki july ke baad vartmanmaharashtra sarkaar mushkil main padane vaali he
 The Shiv Sena has been upset with the BJP ever since it came to power in 2014
 haal hi main ek marathi samachar channel se baatcheet karte hue raut ne kaha ki agar kisaanon kaa karj maaf nahin kiya gaya to shivasena samarthan waapas le legi
 Fadnavis challenged Shiv Sena, Fadnavis said without taking any name, some people said that they will topple the government
 samarthan waapas le lenge
 But we are ready for the mid-term election
 agar koi hamen madhyavadhi chunaav ke liye baadhya karata he to ham taiyaar hai
 i am confident that we will form the government again
 unhone kaha ki yah safalataa abhootpurv thi
 No other party has achieved such a victory
 congress-ensipi apane shikhar main bhi itani safalataa hasil nahin kar sakin
 The presidential election is going to be held next month before the presidential election
 ravivaar ko hi bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne shivasena supremeo uddhav thakare se mulaakaat kii thi
 BJP is trying to get NDA allies to agree on this issue
 aise main fadanvis ke is bayaan ke kai myne nikaale ja sakate hai
 In the hope of getting tickets for the Lok Sabha elections, many leaders changed parties, but this method did not work for many
 aam taur par kisi bhi chunaav se pehle apane laabh ke liye netaaon ke dal badalane kaa rivaaj purana rahaa he, lekin is chunaav main kai netaa aise bhi hai jo chale the 'haribhajan ko, oton lage kapaas'
 The leaders changed the party and changed their 'nizam', but they could not find any whereabouts
 bihar main is loksabhaa chunaav main mukhya muqabla bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) nit rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) or vipakshi dalon ke mahagathbandhan ke bich he
 In all the 40 Lok Sabha seats of Bihar, candidates have been decided on most of the seats, but many defective leaders are still worried about their whereabouts
 ab sthiti yah he ki aise netaa yaa to 'bina dal' (nirdaleey) chunaav maidan main utren yaa phir nae dal main apane badale sankalpon ke saath rahen
 Uday Narayan Chaudhary, former Speaker of Bihar Legislative Assembly, moved into the camp of former JD (U) Speaker Sharad Yadav after losing the assembly elections in 2015
 sutron kaa kahana he ki choudhary jamui se chunaav ladanaa chaahate the, lekin sharad yadav ko madhepura se rajd ke chinh par chunaav ladanaa pad rahaa he or choudhary kahin se bhi tikat nahin le sake
 Similar is the case with Lovely Anand, wife of former MP Anand Mohan
 lavali shivahar seat se chunaav ladane kii ichha liye congress main shaamil to ho gayi, lekin shivahar seat mahagathbandhan ke ghatak rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke khate main chali gai
 In such a situation, Lovely is thinking of contesting as an independent
 lavali anand kahati hai, "mere saath dhokhaa hua he
 i have not received my ticket due to horse trading
 ham or hamaare samarthak hatprabh or niraash hai
 Seeing the disappointment and outrage among the supporters, i will contest and win the independent elections from Shivhar
 mere saath jo vishwasghaat kiya gaya he, iskaa asar shivahar ke saath-saath bihar ke kai sansadeey kshetron main bhi mahagathbandhan ko khamiyaja bhugatna padegaa
 "arun Kumar, who won from Jehanabad in the last Lok Sabha election on the Rashtriya Loksamata Party (RLSP) ticket, has become a similar situation
 arun ne pehle ralospa ke pramukh upendra kushvaha kaa saath choda or khud apni party banaakar mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke kareebi ban gaye
 Later, there was a ruckus with Nitish, then again made a statement in favor of Kushwaha and tried to get close to him, but the matter did not work till the end
 vartmaan samay tak ve bina tikat hai or koi dal unhen ab tak nahin mila he
 Nagmani, who is considered close to the RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha and the party's working president, is also more or less in the same condition
 naagamani ne ralospa se istipha dekar mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa pichley do-teen maheene se gungan kar rahe the
 He had also expressed his desire to contest elections from the Karakat parliamentary constituency, but later on he too remained betrothed
 purv pradesh congress adhyaksh ramjatan sinha ne bhi loksabhaa chunaav ke thik pehle congress kaa 'haath' chhodkar jad (you) kaa daaman thama tha, lekin unhen bhi tikat ko lekar niraashaa haath lagi he
 RLSP leader Bhagwan Singh Kushwaha also hoped that he would get the benefit of going to the JD (U) and contesting from Ara's seat
 yahi kaaran he ki disambar main unhone paala badalakar jad (you) ke saath ho liye the, magar unhen bhi iskaa laabh nahin mila
 Apart from this, suspended MP from BJP Kirti Azad has joined the Congress, but he is also 'betrothed', he hoped that he would be made a candidate from Darbhanga region, but Darbhanga seat went to rjd's account
 rajd ne abdul baari siddiki ko darbhanga se ummidavaar banaaya he
 According to the proposals received from mps in the order of priority, road construction should be taken after obtaining the approval of widening and strengthening of roads

 is dauraan pradhanmantri narendra modi ne shuukravaar ko kaha tha ki aatankwaad maanavtaa ke liye sabase bada khatra he jo na sirf begunaahon kii hatya karata he balki aarthik vikaas or saamaajik sthirataa ko bhi buree tarah prabhavit karata he
 PM Modi said that there is a need to stop supporting terrorism and casteism by any means
 himachal pradesh vidhansabha chunaav behad dilachasp mode par aa pahunchaa he
 Just ten days before the vote, BJP has surprised everyone by announcing the name of senior leader Prem Kumar Dhumal as the Chief Ministerial candidate
 dhumal ke naam kii ghoshnaa ke baad ab muqabla do rashtriya dalon ke saath, unke do bujurg netaaon ke bich ho gaya he
 The BJP has adopted the trick of changing the electoral equations of Himachal not only by making Dhumal a face, but the party has been removed from the race to contest elections till the age of 75 years
 lekin isse bhi bada sawaal ye he ki kya bijepi ko haar ke dar ne aisa karne par majaboor kiya he?darasal, ye sawaal isliye kyonki 2015 main dilli main bhi kuch aisa hi dekhne ko mila tha
 The Aam Aadmi Party was leading strongly in the Delhi Assembly elections
 arvind kejariwal ke chehre ke saath aap chunavi ran main bijepi-congress se aage nikalati najar aa rahi thi
 At the same time, BJP did not even have a strong face like Kejriwal
 achaanak party ne desh kii pehali mahila ipies kiran bedi ko siem pad kaa ummidavaar bana diya
 Bedi's name was announced two weeks ago to go to polls on 7 February 2015 for the Delhi Assembly elections
 chunaav prachaar apane charam par tha
 Narendra Modi and Amit Shah had given full strength
 isi darmyaan 20 janvari ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kiran bedi ke netritv main chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa kii
 The result was that Kiran Bedi contested from Krishna Nagar seat and she could not even win her seat
 bijepi ne parampara ko badlahimachal ke do baar siem rah chuke prem kumaar dhumal ko siem candidet banaakar bijepi ne chunaav se pehle mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa naam ghoshit na karne kii apni parampara ko bhi badla he
 Assembly elections were held in five states in 2017 but the party did not announce the CM face before the elections in any state
 upi, uttarakhand, punjab, manipur or goa main chunaav se pehle koi phase saamne nahin laayaa gaya
 Even astonishing everyone, the BJP made Yogi Adityanath in UP, Manohar Parrikar out of the Modi cabinet in Goa and Trivendra Singh Rawat in Uttarakhand as CM
 maharashtra-haryana main bhi nahin diya tha namisase pehle centre main modi sarkaar banane ke turant baad maharashtra kaa chunaav bhi bijepi ne modi ke phase par hi ladaa or jeet darj kii
 After which Devendra Fadnavis was made CM
 haryana main bhupendra singh hooda ke majboot congressi netritv ko parrast kar bijepi ne anubhavheen manohar laal khatter ko soobe kii kaman saunpi
 In such a situation, the announcement of the name of CM Face after releasing the declaration for Himachal Pradesh is a bit surprising
 sutron ke mutabik, 9 november ko matdaan se thik pehle party adhyaksh amit shah ne achaanak ye faisla liya he
 It is being told that before announcing Dhumal's name from Rajgarh rally on October 31, Amit Shah summoned Dhumal to Shimla on Tuesday
 dhumal apane grih janapad hamirpur main chunavi raily kar rahe the, jahaan se unhen shimla bulaakar amit shah ne unase meeting kii
 It is being told that after this a final decision was taken to make Dhumal the CM candidate
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki virbhadra singh himachal main bada kad rakhte hai
 The Congress had announced its name and played a card to attract the electoral atmosphere towards it, which was also visible
 mana ja rahaa he ki isi ke chalate bijepi ko bhi antim vakt par soobe ke sabase bharosemand or majboot chehre prem kumaar dhumal ke netritv kaa elaan karnaa padaa
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on a one-day Afghanistan tour on Friday, from where he suddenly announced to go to Lahore and meet PM Nawaz Sharif
 modi ke is tarah achaanak pakistan jane ke elaan se ek taraf jahaan hairaani hui he, vahiin duusari taraf donon deshon ke bich badi dooriyaan kam hone kii ummid bhi bandhi
 India and Pakistan, which were once the same country, have never been the same
 inamen hameshaa utaar-chadhaav kii sthiti bani rahi
 Even after the bjp's arrival at the Center in May 2014, the relations of the two were seen to be improving sometimes and sometimes deteriorating
 donon deshon ke bich badalte samikarnon par ek najaramodi kaa shapath grahan samarohamai 2014 main jab narendra modi ne centre main sarkaar banaate hue pradhanmantri pad kii shapath lee thi, us vakt navaj sharif bhi vahaan maujuud the
 It was for the first time that the two met as Prime Ministers
 iske agle din donon ke bich ek aupchaarik mulaakaat bhi hui thi
 Different opinions came from different circles about Modi's invitation to the Nawaz
 bhartiya videsh sachivon kii yatra raddbharat or pakistan ke videsh sachivon ne aapasi baatcheet ko aage badhaane ke liye agast 2014 main mulaakaat karne kaa faisla kiya
 The secretaries of India decided to go to Pakistan, but before that the High Commissioner of Pakistan met the separatists of Kashmir in Delhi
 is par bharat ne kadi naaraazgi darj karai or apane videsh sachivon kii yatra radd kar di
 After this, a situation of tension arose again between the two countries
 saarc sammelan main munh modiske baad november 2014 main nepal kii rajdhani kathmandu main hue 18wein saarc sammelan main modi or sharif kii mulaakaat to hui lekin donon ke bich dwipaksheeya vaarta nahin hui
 Both showed no interest in taking the matter forward
 upha main bhi hui thi mulakatarus ke upha main hui mulaakaat main bhi donon netaaon ne baatcheet ko phir se behaal karne par sahmati jataai thi
 In August 2015, a consensus was reached at the National Security Advisor (NSA) level talks
 paak ne phir alaap diya kashmir raagais saal agast main enese str kii vaarta se pehle pakistan ne ek baar phir se kashmir ke mudde ko uthaa diya
 Pakistan said that without raising the issue of Kashmir, talks between the two countries are not possible
 itnaa hi nahin, pakistan ne shart rakhi ki baithak se pehle wo algaavvaadi netaaon se mulaakaat karenge
 After this, the matter got so bad that this time Pakistan canceled its advisors' visit to India
 paris main mili the modi-navajisase pehle 30 november ko paris main pradhanmantri narendra modi or unke pakistani samakaksh navaj sharif ke bich hui mulaakaat ke dauraan bani sahmati ke baad aatankwaad par vaarta karne kaa faisla liya gaya tha
 Accordingly, NSA level talks were held in Bangkok
 videsh mantri ne loksabhaa main kaha tha ki ek hi baithak se sabhi samasyaon kaa samaadhaan nahin nikal saktaa
 So, we will continue to talk on terrorism
 sushamaa swaraj bhi gayi pakistanvidesh mantri sushamaa swaraj isi maheene pakistan ke islamabad pahunchin, jahaan unhone kamjor padi dwipaksheeya vaarta ko aage badhaayaa
 The talks had stalled since the 2008 Mumbai attacks
 yahaan tay hua ki agle saal janvari main donon deshon ke videsh sachivon ke bich baat hogi
 Happy birthday to Sharif PM Modi himself tweeted on Wednesday that in the morning he spoke to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on the phone and wished him a happy birthday and he reached Lahore
 mana ja rahaa he ki donon deshon ke bich rishton ko sudhaarney kii ye ek acchhee koshish he
 Explain that the finance ministry was with Nitin Patel in the previous Anandiben Patel and Vijay Rupani government
 pichhali baar vitt, shahari vikaas, udyog or rajasav jaise damdaar mantralayon chalaane vaale nitin patel ko is baar kam ahmiyat vaale swasthya, sadak-bhawan jaise mantralay mili hai
 Politics is now intensifying when IIT Madras banned a student forum against PM Modi
 argedy supremeo lalu prasad ne vivaad ko hawa dete hue kaha he ki IIT main group ko bain kar centre ne daliton kaa apmaan kiya he
 Lalu Prasad has linked the whole matter to the humiliation of Dalits
 unhen baithe-bithaae centre par hamalaa karne kaa ek mauka mil gaya
 Modi govt crushing dalit voice & freedom of speech, bans a dalit group in IIT Madras for criticizing govt
 Is it ur way of honoring Ambedkar?— Lalu Prasad Yadav (@laluprasadrjd)may 29, 2015puraa maamla is tarah he
 In fact, IIT Madras banned a forum for allegedly spreading hate against PM Modi
 chaatro ke is forum ke khilaaf shikaayat milane ke baad santhaan ne ise bain karne kaa faisla kiya
 In the complaint against the forum, it was said that this group of students is tricking other students on the use of Hindi, beef and some other policies of the central government
 IIT campus main ambedkar-periyar student sarkal (APSC) ke khilaaf shikaayat milane ke baad maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne jaanch karai, jiske baad IIT ne student sarkal par pratibandh lagaaya
 However, after the formation of the Modi government at the Center, this is the first case of its kind
 vichaaron kii aazaadee ek baar phir sawaalon ke ghere main najar aa rahi he
 There is a possibility of this controversy to catch more power
 bijepilist, smritiigmethi, best kot of modi jaise hashtag shanivaar kii subah jab trend kar rahe the to usee bich academix for namo naam se ek hashtag teji se upar aayaa or lagaataar teen ghante tak top par bana rahaa
 After doing Google research, it was found that the main objective of this exercise started by some professors of Delhi University, JNU and BHU is to re-appoint Narendra Modi
 inkaa maananaa he ki pichley 5 saal main modi ne bahut hi achche kaam kiye hai or unhen ek or mauka milanaa chahie
 The founder of the Academy for Namo Campaigns campaign, Dr
 swadesh singh kaa kahana he ki agar modi ke virodh main prabud samaaj kaa ek hissaa kuch kaarnon se khadaa ho saktaa he
 At the same time, some people feel that if Narendra Modi has done many good things in 5 years, then he should come forward
 aise logon ko narendra modi ke samarthan main abhiyaan chalaakar prabud samaaj ke logon ko samajhaana chahie
 In this campaign every section connected with enlightened society viz
 
 
 professor, chintak, vichaarak, stanbhakaar aadi virgon se apil kii ja rahi he ki wo modi ke paksh main bolen, likhen or logon ko samajhaayen
 Another professor associated with this campaign said that if Modi has become the agenda then why not enlightened people stand in support of him, because people of enlightened society carry torch and show the way before the society
 2019 main modi sabase acha vikalp hai isliye unhen phir se chunakar aana chahie
 Talking People 'academics for Namo' has also started an essay competition to connect young thinkers, researchers and teachers
 jisamen modi sarkaar kii nitiyon or nae bharat ke vishay par apni pravishtiyaan bhejne ke liye apil kii he
 The campaign, which started as an online campaign on March 5, has attracted many people
 swadesh singh ke mutabik abtak 70 shaharon ke 200 se adhik sansthaanon ke 1000 se adhik praadhyaapak jud gaye hai or apana samarthan de chuke hai
 After March 25, offline meetings of Academics for Namo will also be held
 bijepi 2019 ke lakshya ko bhedane ke liye koi kor kasar nahin chhodana chaahati
 In the month of January, the party showed its strength on social media with hashtags like # Modi once more # Mera PM Mera Abhiman
 vahiin haal main # modi he to mumkin he, # main bhi chaukeedaar hashtag se bijepi ne soshal platform kii hawa apni taraf modane kii koshish kii
 # To support the watchman hashtag too, the Prime Minister himself and all his cabinet ministers put the watchman on his profile before his name

 com / oveox3yyhh— Chowkidar Smriti z Irani (@smritiirani)march 23, 2019 Amazon Prime's web series Mirzapur has been in the news since its release
 isaki kahani 6 mukhya kirdaaron ke ird-gird gumti he
 The crime thriller series stars Pankaj Tripathi, Ali Fazal, Divyendu Sharma, Vikrant Massey, Rajesh Tailang and Shweta Tripathi in the lead roles
 duusare kai or kalakaaron kaa kaam bhi kaaphi ahm he
 Mirzapur is a great web series in terms of acting
 isamen kai actors kaa kaam sarprising he
 Ali Fazal, Divyendu Sharma and Pankaj Tripathi opposite Kulbhushan Kharbanda and Shubharajyoti in the role of helpless old man in front of the main characters is like a secret package
 aaie jaanate hai siries main kis kalakaar ne kaisaa kaam kiya he
 
 
 Review 2: How is Pankaj Tripathi and Ali Fazal's Mirzapur in acting? # 1
 pankaj treepathisiris main pankaj treepathi "kaaleen bhaiya" ke kirdaar main hai
 He plays in this role, but does not seem to be as effective as he has been seen in such roles before
 pankaj treepathi ke liye yah sochane kaa vakt he
 He is getting typed into certain roles, especially in the role of a mafia or father
 lekhak or nirdeshak ko mirzapur main pankaj ke kirdaar par or kaam karnaa tha
 Pankaj is also responsible for how he differentiates himself from his older characters
 mirzapur main kai jagah wo "bareli kii barfi" ke pita vaale kirdaar main najar aate hai
 Just don't smile
 to kuch seens main "gudgaanv" ke mafia
 They have to get out of this slot
 mirzapur main dekhen to pankaj kaa kirdaar aakiri episod ke us seen main adaayagi ke lihaaj se bahut oonchai par najar aata he, jahaan wo police afasar maurya ke saath samvaad karte hai
 # 2
 ali fajalweb siries main guddu pandit ke rup main ali fazal kaa luk kahani or kirdaar ke mutabik hi he
 Guddu is very innocent and straightforward, shy, shy with girls and full of childishness
 uske sapane ek ausat bachche kii tarah hai
 Although in most parts he appears to be in the same mood, due to which Guddu's character became a complexion
 guddu ke vyaktitv ke tamaam duusare rang kaayade se gadhe nahin ho paae
 Yet Ali Fazal's work is excellent
 ek tarah se unke kariyar main best kaam he ye
 He has lived with full vigor like the story and scenes he got
 Review 3: ali fazal, pankaj treepathi kii web siries mirzapur main kahaan ho gai chook? # 3
 Vikrant Massey is also cast in the role of Vikrant Masibablu Pandit
 unki ankhon main sankoch, dar or gussa kirdaar ke mutabik hi he
 However, because of the story, his character does not look very big
 vikrant ne pehali baar is tarah kaa role kiya he
 After this character, he will be in different demand
 # 4
 Divyendu Sharma as Divyendu Sharmamunna Tripathi surprises us the most
 ab tak filmon main unke abhinay ko dekhte aae logon ko mirzapur dekhakar tajjub hoga
 Munna is cruel and adulterous in a way that erases lust on the house maid
 jaise wo bistar par apane khilaaf uth rahi har aawaaj ko mirzapur main raudna chahta he
 He is so terroristic that he gets anyone to die mercilessly with a splash of urine on his shoes
 yahaan tak ki mirzapur kaa king banane ke liye use apane pita kii jaan lene main bhi koi gurej nahin he
 Munna's character Divyendu has tried to show all the colors
 mirzapur main compounder kaa galaa retane vaale seen main unhen dekhnaa adbhut he
 Mirzapur Review-1: Undue violence and scandal in the story disappointed # 5
 kulbhushan kharbandamirzapur main agar kisi kaa kaam sabase zyada chunauteepurn tha to wo hai kulbhushan kharbanda
 Because most of his character in the series remains silent
 unke haavbhaav or unki ankhen samvaad karti hai
 His parts have received very few dialogues, but he has played the character of an old mafia boasting of helpless, extremely racist masculinity by the feet
 wo bahu binaa ke aniatik sambandhon kaa jis tarah phayda uthaate hai or uskaa balaatkaar karte hai, naukar raja ko jis tareeke sajaa dilavaate hai, use dekhakar unke kirdaar se ghin hoti he
 This is the height of Kulbhushan's acting
 # 6
 Shubhrajyothi's character as Shubhrajyoti Bharatharati may be small but he is the most perfect in the series in terms of acting, local dialogue and look
 isiilie har seen main wo kaaphi janche bhi hai
 It does not take a moment to see that Rati is not the mafia of Mirzapur or Jaunpur

 Indian fast bowling leader Zaheer Khan has advised young Indian fast bowlers including Ishant Sharma to play in county cricket to improve their performance

 The left-arm fast bowler said that playing in county cricket helps the player to become more independent and professional and has advised some Indian bowlers including Ishant to play in county cricket
 jahir ne jikyuu patrika ko diye saakshaatkaar main kaha, main ishanth jaise kai yuva tej gendbaajon ko (county cricket main khilne kii) salaah de rahaa hum
 When you are at home, you are looked after in many ways

 agar aapke paas bhi ford ekosport he, to phir yah khabar aapke liye hi he
 The company has announced the withdrawal (recall) of 20,752 Ford Accosport in India, as these vehicles had some problems
 in samasyaon ko thik karne ke liye company ab apane graahakon ko likhane vaali he
 The company has informed that between January 2013 and September 2014, all Ford Acosport vehicles manufactured at the company's Chennai plant will be checked
 ise walentary ricol bataaya ja rahaa he, or yah kadam graahakon kii samasyaon ke maddenzar uthaaya ja rahaa he
 According to the company, both variants of the Ford Acosport Petrol, a liter Acoboost and 1
 5 litre engine, main ful or vaper line main jang lagane kaa dar dekhte hue company workshop main bulaakar unhen thik karegi
 There is another problem, which the company is talking about fixing in this recall, that is to fix the wiring problem in the top end titanium option to open the side airbags properly
 ford graahakon ko likh rahi he ki ve pataa karen or sthaneey ford dealer se sampark karen, jahaan bina graahak ke kharche ke badlaav kiye ja saken
 Even in the beginning, Ford recalled the diesel version of its Ford Acosport
 haalanki vah launch ke aasapaas kaa rikol tha, to sankhya 972, yani hazaar se kam kaaron kii thi
 At that time, the diesel version had a glow plug problem
 vaise, company ne haal main apni teen hazaar se zyaada fiesta gaadiyaan bhi rikol kii thim
 The wait for this recall had been going on since Ford in Australia announced the recall of the Acosport made in India
 vahaan par said airbag kii samasya bataai gai thi
 Even if the companies do not breathe the same with respect to the recall, as before
 companiyaan gadiyon ko bulaane main pehle bahut zyaada bachati thim, badanaami ke dar se ve yaa to chhipakar kaaron ko thik karti rahi hai yaa graahakon ko unke haal par chhodti rahi he, lekin ab companiyon kii taraf se rikol kaa elaan pehle se zyaada hota he
 Even if companies are not afraid of recalls, customers are not afraid, but the quality of vehicles being exported to India needs to be double checked, if efforts like 'make in India' are to be successful worldwide

 The film 'tum Bin 2' is the story of a love couple Taran and Amar who live in London
 ek durghatana kii vajah se amar gaayab he or use mara hua samaj liya jaataa he
 That's when Shekhar comes into the life of Amar's family and fills happiness in that family and Taran's life
 yahaan tak kii taran or shekhar main ishq shuru ho jaataa he or tabhi 8 maheenon tak kisi or jagah coma main rahane ke baad amar apane ghar waapas aa jaataa he or film ban jaati he trikoniya prem kahani
 To find out who will get the climax, you have to watch the film
 is tarah kii trikoniya prem kahani aapane pehle kai baar dekhi hogi magar har film ko ek duusare se alag banaati he uski patakatha
 The screenplay of this film is also different
 film ke pehle half main achche imotional seen hai
 It is a pain to fall in love
 jawan bete ko khone kaa pita kaa dukh he
 In the film, the characters living in the room with Taran add some more life
 in kirdaaron ke bich hansi majaak ke drishy hai jo darshakon ko samay samay par syrius maahaul se baahar nikalate hai
 There are beautiful views of London and surrounding areas
 bich bich main kaanon ko achche lagane vaale sangeet kii awaz sunai detii he
 Neha Sharma, Aditya Seal and Aseem Gulati play their respective characters well
 tippaniyan i very much liked a scene of 'tum Bin-2' in which a Pakistani Hindu family is in London
 vah parivaar dharm or samskruti main fark samajhataa he
 Anubhav Sinha has said a lot with this scene
 magar interval ke baad film main sab kuch ulta hone lagata he
 The film starts to slow down and its length starts to increase
 aisa lagane lagata he ki lekhak or nirdeshak anubhav sinha ke paas film ke duusare bhaag main dikhaane ko kuch bachaa hi nahin isliye wo film ko khinchne lage
 So my rating for this film is 2
 5 star
 You may have seen this kind of triangular love story many times before, but what makes each film different is its script
 is film kaa screenple bhi alag he
 The film has good emotional scenes in the first half
 pyaar se bichhadne kaa dard he
 The father is sad to lose the young son
 film main taran ke saath room main rahane vaale kirdaar kuch or jaan daalate hai
 There are scenes of laughter joking between these characters that make the audience get out of the serious atmosphere from time to time
 landan or aas paas ke ilaakon ke sundar drishy hai
 The sound of music that sounds good to the ears is heard in between
 neha sharma, aditya sil or aseem gulati ne apane apane kirdaaron ko achche se nibhaayaa he
 The comments 'tum bin-2' kaa ek seen mujhe behad pasand aayaa jisamen dikhaaya gaya he ki ek pakistani hindu parivaar landan main he
 That family understands the difference between religion and culture
 is seen ke dwaara anubhav sinha ne bade hi achche se bahut kuch kah diya he
 But after the interval everything in the film starts going upside down
 film kii raftaar dhimi padane lagati he or isaki lambaai zyada lagane lagati he
 It seems that writer and director Anubhav Sinha has nothing left to show in the second part of the film, so he starts pulling the film
 isliye is film ke liye meri reating he 2
 5 stars

 Star pacer Bumrahidilli has recovered from injury, started with a trainer from rehabteam India The legacy set by the former trainer Shankar Basu at the team and the National Cricket Academy (NCA) is crumbling
 bhartiya team ke chotil tej gendbaaj jasprit bumraah ensie main rihaib na kar is samay us shaks ke saath rihaib kar rahe hai, jisaki kaabiliyat ko nakaar diya gaya tha or rashtriya team main shaamil nahin kiya gaya tha
 Bumrah is currently rehabbing with IPL franchisee Delhi Capitals trainer Rajinikanth Sivagananam
 dilachasp baat yah he ki rajnikant vahi shaks hai, jinhen agast main bhartiya team ke strength and condishning coach pad ke liye nahin chunaa gaya tha or kaam nik web ko diya gaya tha
 All this happened under the guidance of the Committee of Administrators (COA)
 bumraah in dinon emsie main le rahe prashikshanek sutara ne pitiai ko bataaya ki bumraah mumbai cricket association (emsie) main prashikshan le rahe hai
 These are private arrangements
 ' bumraah agle saal newjiland daure par vaapasi karenge, jisamen bharat paanch tii-20, teen vanade or do test khelegaa
 Despite being an employee of the Delhi IPL team, Rajinikanth also works personally with the players
 dilli capitals ke ek sutara ne kaha ,‘jab ipel nahin chal rahaa he, tab rajnikant kisi ke bhi saath kaam karne ke liye swatantra hai
 Apart from the national selectors, Randeep Moitra, owner of Kolkata's Indoorfins Gym was also in the panel which took the practical exam for trainer recruitment
 is panel ne luk woodhouse tathaa web ko rajnikant par tarjeeh di thi
 Talking to IANS, a senior BCCI official not only raised questions on this, but also asked whether the appointments made during the time of COA should be considered afresh
 It is not a matter of Nick, but for Rajinikanth the process was much more difficult than the rest
 panel main maujuud ek shaks se maine rajani ke prati is shatruta jaise vyavhaar kii jaanch kii thi
 He was asked by the panel to do things like a gym trainer who had not told anyone else
 ek hairaan karne vaali baat yah thi ki us panel main ek shaks aisa tha, jisane rajani ke str ke mukaable kaam hi nahin kiya
 It will be very interesting to know who put him in the panel
 'bhartiya team main bumraah kaa sthaan behad ahm he or is maamle se jude ek sutara ne ieenes se kaha ki bhartiya team prabandhan unke rihaib ko lekar kisi tarah kaa jokhim nahin lenaa chahta he
 Bumrah complains of a stress fracture in his back
 sutara ne kaha, 'ham apane sarvshereshth gendbaaj ke saath kisi tarah kaa jokhim nahin le sakate, tab bhi jab unka sharir sahi tarah se vaapasi kar rahaa ho
 Therefore he was sent to Great Britain
 hamaare saamne nae saal main newjiland kaa ahm daura he or vah is daure kii ranneeti kaa ahm hissaa hai
 Hence, the team management is willing to wait for Bumrah to return to the team by returning to his best form for the tour of New Zealand
 rihaib ke liye ensie kii kyon ho rahi andekhi?yah pehla maamla nahin he ki bharat ke kisi khilaadi ne rihaib ke liye ensie kii andekhi kii he or puure desh main maujuud trainer kaa maananaa he ki trainron ko unki kaabiliyat ke alaava nishchit kaaran ke aadhaar par chunaa jaataa he

 ab gujarat chunaav ke chalate bijepi chunaav ayog se sirf chunaav tak roak lagane kii maang kar rahi he
 After all, he is now afraid of Kshatriya votes
 indira ji ne bhi amba devi mandir se chunaav prachaar kii shuruyaat kii thi, rahul ji ne dwarka se kii, to modi ji peeche aae
 If Rahul went to Chotila temple, PM also came
 gohil ne kaha, vikaas pagal ho gaya he, ye janata ne bataaya
 This is the voice of the public, the BJP spends its campaign through its professional team
 ranvir singh se INSECURE hue shahid, diarector ke saamne rakhi ye shartbijepi ne kya kaha?isse pehle bijepi ne chunaav ayog, centre sarkaar or sensor board ko ek chitthee likhi he

 bhartiya rigerv bank ke governor raghuram rajan ne aaj nitigat byaaj dar main koi badlaav nahin kiya
 He wants to see the effect of recent unseasonal rains on food inflation and also wants consumers to take advantage of previous cuts in the repo rate
 repo dar vah dar he, jis par kendriya bank vanijyik bainkon ko taatkaalik aavashyaktaa ke liye nakadi udhaar detaa he
 Repo rate currently 7
 5 pratishat he
 The Reserve Bank did not make any change in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) and it will remain at four per cent
 siaraar bainkon ke paas jamaa raashi kaa vah hissaa he, jo unhen rigerv bank ke paas rakhana hota he or is par rigerv bank unhen byaaj nahin detaa
 Governor Rajan said in the first bi-monthly review of the monetary policy for 2015-16 today, that even though the demand for credit has been reduced and policy rates have been cut twice already, it has not yet shown an impact on the rate of debt
 governor rajan ne kaha, arabiai kii pahal kaa asar aage nahin nahin pahunchaa he (arthath bainkon ne rin kii daren nahin ghatai hai)
 Further, the coming data is expected to further clarify the inflation balance situation
 is liye rigerv bank main yathasthiti barkaraar rakhi he
 The possibility of an increase in food prices has increased due to unseasonal rains and hailstorms affecting rabi ready crops in north and west India
 rajan ne isse pehle samiksha baithkon se alag janvari or march main 0

 He said that other elements like food prices will be monitored and the impact of recent unseasonal rains will also be closely monitored
 unhone kaha ki rigerv bank visfithik jokhimon ke prati satark rahegaa
 At the same time, he also says that the pace of inflation is at the same time as per RBI estimates
 21 march ko puure desh main holi (holi) badi hi dhoomdhaam se manaai jaaegi

 It is believed that Hiranyakashyap's son Pralhad built a temple in honor of Lord Narasimha (an incarnation of Vishnu), which currently falls in the Pakistani city of Multan
 bhagwaan narsingh ne hi khambhe main apane darshan dekar bhakt pralhad kii jaan bachaai thi
 Holi started from this temple

 The matki is then broken by climbing one above the other in the shape of a pyramid
 khaas baat, is matki main bhi makkhan or mishri bhari hoti he
 In Multan, Pakistan, this festival is called chowk-poorna festival
 vahiin, aapako bataa den bhagwaan narsingh ke is pehle mandir ko nuksaan pahunchayagaya
 According to The Speaking Tree, after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in India, several Hindu temples were demolished in Pakistan, one of which was the Pralhadpuri temple

 a person had complained via e-mail to the PMO that many children begging at traffic signals were abducted
 diene test se yah pataa chal jayega ki jo koi bheekh maangane vaale bachche ke maa-baap hone kaa daawa karte hai, unke daawey main kitni sachai he
 However, if this campaign of Delhi Police is successful, then many gangs involved in the theft of children will come under the law

 input - bhashaa Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has opened his treasury on the front of farmers and rural economy in the general budget
 haalanki madhyam varg ke liye is bajet main kuch khaas nahin mila he
 In contrast, the budget has raised its worries
 bajet ke baad aam aadmi ke ghar kaa bajet gadabadane kii ashanka paidaa ho gai he
 The reason for this is the lack of relief on the income tax front and the possibility of rising inflation
 aaie jaanate hai kaise desh ke aam bajet ne aapkaa kharch badhaane kaa kaam kiya he
 Also, know where you may have to spend more
 padegi mahangaai kii maraam bajet main sarkaar ne kisaanon kii aamadani ko doguna karne ke liye agri utpaadon ke nunatam samarthan mulya main dedh guna ijapha karne kaa faisla liya he

 bigadega rasoi kaa bajtsamarthan mulya badhaane se desh main fasal utpaada kii keemton main ijapha ho jaataa he jiske chalate mahangaai badhanaa tay ho jaataa he
 In fact, this policy decision of higher support price will put a burden on the treasury of the central government and wheat, rice, pulses and oilseeds will be available to the common man at a higher than fixed price

 tex ke morche par bhi raahat nahinkendre sarkaar ne aam bajet main tex ke morche par bhi koi raahat nahin di he
 The common man hoped that he would get a relief of at least 50 thousand rupees on the tax front in this budget
 lekin sarkaar ne isamen koi badlaav nahin kiya he or inhen puraane tex slab main hi rakhaa he
 This is the tax rate: In the current time, you have to pay 5 to 30 percent tax according to your income

 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki in baton ke alaava khaane-pine kii aadaton main blad group kaa dhyaan rakhana bhi jaruri he
 Each bulld group has its own distinct nature and nature, so our food is also associated with our bulldog
 blad group chaar prakaar ke hote hai: e, bi, abi or o

 lekin ham aapkaa yahaan bhi bataa rahe hai ki kis blad group menkya khaanaa chahie or kis cheez se parhez karnaa chahie-o blad grap ke liye protein he besto blad group samooh ke logon ko hai protein yukt aahaar lenaa chahie
 Add pulses, meats, fish, fruits etc
 to your diet
 apane khaane main anaaj or beans ke saath hi faliyon kii maatra ko santulit rakhen
 Adopt a blood group, then people with a vegetarian blood group have a very sensitive immune system, so they should pay more attention to their diet
 is group ke logon ko meet kam khaanaa chahie kyonki yah pachne main vakt letaa hai
 If you belong to a blood group then reduce the intake of chicken and mutton
 gaajar, hari patteydaar subjiyan, naashpati, lahasun, anaaj, beans or falon kaa seven karnaa is blad group waalon ke liye best rahegaa
 Care should be taken in consuming milk and things made from it, white rice and eggs
 inke sthaan par dahi yaa soya milk kaa seven kar sakate hai
 There are b blood groups, if Lucky is your blood type b then it may be good news for you
 darasal is blad group waalon ko zyada parhez nahin karnaa padataa
 You can eat green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish, mutton and chicken
 is blad group waalon kaa unka pachan tantra bahut acha hota he jisase inke sharir main fat jamaa nahin hota
 These people should take plenty of milk and things made from it, eggs etc
 bas ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki khanpan kii inaki aadaten santulit hon
 If AB is a blood group, then keep it balanced
 Diet AB blood group is found in very few people
 jo chijen e or bi waalon ko parhez karne ke liye bataai jaati hai, vahi chijen khaane main inhen bhi saavdhaanee baranti chahie
 People with AB blood group should eat more fruits and vegetables
 is blad group vaale logon ke liye andey bhi laabhadaayak hote hai
 At the same time, they should eat less non-veg
 haalanki doodh se bani chijen, butter aadi inako nuksaan nahin pahunchaate hai

 Let's not get personal

 Anything can happen
 Being PM does not make anyone the wisest in the country

 bollywood kii 'aakrosh,' 'gangs of vasepur' 'khatta-meetha' 'chitagaanv' or 'commando' sareekhee filmon main damdaar acting kar industry main behad kam samay main jagah banane vaale actor jayadeep ahlavat kii khwaahish he ki vah mashhoor shaayar mirza gaalib kaa role karen
 Jaideep will soon be seen in the film 'meerutia Gangster'
 film ke bare main jab hamane jayadeep se baat kii to unhone film ke saath-saath apane bare main bhi kai dilachasp baaten bataai
 Is 'meerutia Gangster' some kind of film? 'meerutia Gangster' is a crime-comedy film which is the story of 6 unemployed but ambitious boys from Meerut district of UP
 ladke paise kamaane ke liye shortkat apanaate hai or krime karte hai
 What is your role in 'meerutia Gangster'? i am playing the character of a rude Meerutia boy named Nitin Chaudhary who is the leader of them all
 haalanki vah leader bas naam kaa hota he leader se zyada vah in sabakaa dost hota he, vah doston ke saath bephikr hokar majaak-masti bhi karata he
 How did you feel working in Zeeshan's direction? Zeeshan is my friend, he has a great understanding of films
 shooting ke dauraan agar mujhe kisi seen ko lekar dout hota tha to main jishaan kii raay jarur letaa tha
 We used to discuss about scenes
 kul milakar kaha jaae to jishaan ke diarection main kaam karne kaa anubhav behtareen rahaa
 What was the most special thing about the film? The most special thing about the film is the story of 6 friends who are based on true events
 film main ladakon kaa group desi anderworld jaisaa he
 Have you always wanted to become an actor? i have always wanted to be an army officer, whose problem is still today whenever i see an army officer, i get lost somewhere
 army meraa pehla pyaar he jiskaa malaal mujhe hameshaa rahegaa
 However, i am also happy with my acting life
 industry main koun aapako sabase zyada prabhavit karata he?mujhe industry main manoj bajpai bahut prabhavit karte hai unka kaam karne kaa andaaj mujhe bahut pasand he
 He is a very 'down to earth' human being
 main unhen apana dost maanata hum pataa nahin vah maanate hai ki nahin (hansate hue)
 'anurag Kashyap and Zeeshan Qadri are also good friends of mine
 industry main jane kaa sapana dekhne waalon ke liye koi salaah?glamer or shoharat ko dekhakar bollywood kabhi naa jaaen, bas puri mehnat or lagan ke saath apana kaam karen kyonki industry main mehnat hi aapaki kismat tay karegi
 Initially, even if you do not get success, but if you do not stop working, then one day you will definitely get success because many such actors came in the industry whose first film was a super hit but after that they got lost
 isliye lagaataar mehnat karte rahanaa hi safalataa kaa moolmantra he

 In the last phase of Lok Sabha on May 19, though votes will be cast in 59 seats, including 8 states and 8 seats in Bihar, but in Bihar, the most eye is on bjp's Ravi Shankar Prasad vs
 Shatrughan Sinha of Congress
 shatrughna sinha ke liye simbel bhale hi badla he lekin lokation yani seat nahin badali he
 When Bollywood's shotgun and Shatrughan Sinha, who silences everyone, goes out in the election campaign, Patna Sahib's general public looks desperate to get a glimpse of him
 bhale hi is baar camel kii jagah congress ke ‘haath’ chhap par maidan main utre hai lekin jansampark ke dauraan patna jile ke log unhen vahi pyaar-sammaan or sneh de rahe hai
 Neither Shatrughan Sinha nor his supporters are worried about what will happen in the voting on May 19
 har sabha main shatrughna sinha ke nishane par pratyaksh or paroksh rup se pradhanmantri or bijepi adhyaksh hi hote hai
 During the election campaign, Aaj Tak's Executive Editor Anjana Om Kashyap spoke to Shatrughan Sinha
 unhone modi sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki 'mujhase poocha jaataa he ki 2 karod rojgaar dene kaa vaayada kiya tha, puraa hua kya? wo kehete hai ki pulavama atake par ye kar diya
 They are asked whether the farmers were given a fair price? He is asked whether the report of the Swaminathan Commission was laid in Parliament? They talk of nationalism
 rashtrawaad he, ise sab maanate hai lekin aap shoot and scoot policy kyon karte ho
 'shatrughan Sinha goes out in the same style seeking support from the people
 karine se sajaa-dhaja paridhaan or hameshaa kii tarah logon ko apane shandaar andaaj se lubhaane kaa tarika
 He knows that the fight is strong and Ravishankar Prasad who is challenging him is a strong player of the field, he also does not want to reduce the public relations
 shatrughna sinha mahagathbandhan ke star prachaarak hai
 People rush to shake hands and get a glimpse of them
 shatrughna sinha ne modi-shah jodi par pichley 3 se 4 saalon main jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa he, tikat to cat gaya lekin ve khamosh nahin hue lekin patna sahib chunaav kii khaasiyat ye he kii donon ummidavaar ek duusare ke khilaaf talkh bhashaa kaa istemaal nahin kar rahe hai
 Ravi Shankar Prasad says that if he did wrong, the party cut the ticket but has never spoken against him and will not speak
 lokation nahin badali lekin kya patna sahib main sichuation mushkil ho gai he? is sawaal ke jawaab main shatrughna sinha ne kaha, 'bilkul nahin
 If it were, i would never say that the location would be the same
 lokation vahi he kyonki puraa bihar parivaar mere saath rahaa he
 The people of Patna love, love, believe me
 mujhe koi dikkat nahin he isiilie maine kaha ki dikkat hoti to main yahaan aata hi nahin
 Significantly, Patna Sahib has been a traditional BJP seat for a long time, so the BJP is confident that the 'enemy' will not win
 bihar kii patna sahib loksabhaa seat par is baar rajya kii hi nahin balki puure desh kii najar he
 Taking this election as a test of the influence of Lalu Prasad Yadav and the credibility of the Modi factor
 bataa den ki sinha ko mahagathbandhan kaa bhi samarthan hasil he
 Shatrughan Sinha has always challenged Narendra Modi
 isse jude sawaal ke jawaab main sinha ne kaha ki 'jinhone party ko 200 se zyada siton tak pahunchaaya, jinhone party ke mukhiya mananeey narendra modi ji ko banaaya or bachaaya, aise main hamaare guru laal krishna adwani ji kii kya haalat he
 In what condition is the ultimate scholar Murali Manohar Joshi ji
 arun shouri or yashavanth sinha kii kya haalat he? mere saath jo hua uske bare main zyada varnan karne kii jarurat nahin he
 In Atal Bihari Vajpayee's time, there was a democracy, in today's era there is a dictatorship
 van main sho he, kisi mantri kii nahin chal rahi he
 The PMO is doing all the work
 zyaadaatar mantriyon ko aap jaanate nahin hai, jaanate hai to maanate nahin hai, maanate hai to pahachaanate nahin hai
 If they go to them, they are of no use
 aisi haalat main jaruri ho gaya ek nai disha main janaa, sahi disha main janaa
 Patna Sahib seat was formed in the year 2008 under new delimitation
 iske baad se yahaan par do loksabhaa chunaav hue hai
 Both times Shatrughan Sinha was elected MP on a BJP ticket
 jaateey sameekaran ke aadhaar par kaaysthon kaa dabadabaa rahaa he

 is baar chunaav maidan main congress or bijepi donon hi taraf bade kysth chehre khadey hone kii vajah se vot bantane kaa khatra paidaa ho gaya he
 Shatrughan Sinha has been rebelling against Modi in the last several years, due to the same attitude, Shatrughan Sinha got a ticket from BJP and Congress got a ticket due to this attitude
 narendra modi kaa daawa he ki is baar chunaav main 300 se zyada siten aaengi
 In response to this, Shatrughan Sinha said, 'I know that there is a lot of emphasis on money power and publicity these days
 dhanshakti ko janashakti par bhi haaavee hote dekh rahaa hum or in dinon media par bhi haaavee hote dekh rahaa hum
 The name of the Prime Minister is now called the Minister of Publicity
 300 siten jeet rahe hai
 Will you buy seats from the market, is there a strong emphasis on the grand alliance and the Modi government all over the country, which is the fear, which is the demand of farmers, which is the demand of our youth, who have left so many jobs incomplete, no promises are fulfilled They did not try to complete it
 uske baavjood unka daawa 300 siten jeetne kaa he to ve kah den ki 600 siten jeetenge
 Buy some seats from Chor Bazaar and Chandni Chowk, it will be good for them
 'prachaar ke dauraan shatrughna sinha na ravishankar prasad kaa naam lete hai or na ravishankar prasad apane pratidwandvi shatrughna sinha kaa naam lete hai
 On this question, Shatrughan Sinha said, 'this is the decency of politics
 logon ko isse sabak lenaa chahie
 Ravi Shankar is Sharif and our family friend
 agar ham ek duusare kaa naam nahin lete hai to ye sammaan he, aadar he
 This is a battle of ideology, a battle of issues, on this i confer with Ravi Shankar
 'pichley do loksabhaa chunaavon se patna sahib seat par congress ke ummidavaar number do rahe hai
 In such a situation, this seat has gone to the Congress account under the Grand Alliance and the Congress has made Shatrughan Sinha a candidate
 dilachasp baat ye he ki patna sahib seat par kysth matadaataaon kaa jhukaav bijepi ke paksh main rahata he
 In such a situation, the contest here has become interesting with Shatrughan Sinha landing on Congress ticket
 ab sawaal ye he ki bijepi ke tikat par do baar chunaav jeet chuke shatrughna sinha is baar congress ke sahare apni chunavi hetric laga pate hai yaa nahin

 The incident of beating the priest of Brahma temple in Pushkar has come to light

 The priest Lakshmi Narayana Vasistha helped him in performing the puja

 We returned to the train and handed over the goods to Maqbool
 aabid hamen usee din srinagar ghuma dena chahta tha
 Since we also had less time, we did not object
 tippaniyan He advised us to have food first
 din ke do baj chuke the
 Everyone was hungry
 sab log nonvej khaanaa chaahate the, lekin aabid ne kaha ki nonvej ke liye der ho gai or ab to yah shaam ko hi milegaa
 Little surprise, but there was no scope for question due to hunger
 wo hamen mashhoor krishna bhojanalay le gaya jo paas main hi tha
 Had read about it on the internet
 shuddh vaishnav bhojanalay main bheed bahut zyaada thi
 The waiter led us to a table
 teen yuva ladke khaanaa khatm karne vaale the
 The three locals, with a sense of humor, were Muslims
 hamen dekhakar badi vinamrata se or bhi jaldi uth gaye
 i liked it
 krishna bhojanalay kaa niyam ajeeb he
 For order, you have to cut the slip before going to the counter
 agar khate vakt aapako or kuch chahie tab waiter khud parchi kataate hai
 However, the food was delicious

 usne hamen pehle khaanaa kha lene kii salaah di
 It was two o'clock in the day
 sabhi ko bhukh to lagi hi hui thi
 Everyone wanted to eat non-veg, but Abid said that it was late for non-veg and now it will be available in the evening
 thodi hairaani hui, lekin bhukh ke kaaran sawaal kii gunjaaish nahin thi
 He took us to the famous Krishna restaurant which was nearby
 internet par iske bare main pard rakhaa tha
 The crowd at the Shudh Vaishnav restaurant was very high
 waiter ne hamen ek teble ke paas le jaakar khadaa kar diya
 Three young boys were about to finish eating
 haav-bhav se teenon sthaneey lage, vah muslim the
 Seeing us, we got up very quickly with humility
 acha laga
 The rule of Krishna Restaurant is strange
 order ke liye aapako counder par jaakar pehle parchi kataani padati he
 If you want anything else while eating, then the waiter cuts the slip himself
 baharhaal, khaanaa behad swaadisht tha
