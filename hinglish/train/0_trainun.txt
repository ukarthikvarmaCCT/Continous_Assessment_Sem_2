 The apex court said that the attitude of first arrest and then the rest of the action is 'reprehensible', which should be curbed
 nyaayalay ne sabhi rajya sarkaron ko yah sunishchit karne kaa nirdesh diya ki dahej pratadna maamle sahit saat saal tak kii sajaa ke dandaneey aparaadhon main police giraftaar kaa sahaara nahin le
 a bench headed by Justice Chandramouli Kumar Prasad said, "we direct all state governments to instruct their police officers not to arrest themselves automatically if a case is registered under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code, but rather First satisfy yourself about the requirement of arrest under the criteria provided in Section 41 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki police adhikari ko giraftaar karne kii jarurat ke bare main magistrate ke samaksh kaaran or saamagree pesh kerani hogi
 The judges said, Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code was included with the intention of curbing the problem of harassing the woman by the husband and his relatives
 dhara 498-k ko sangyeya or gaiyr jamaanti aparaadh hone ke kaaran praavdhaanon main ise sandigdh sthaan praapt he, jise asantusht patniyaan kavach kii bajaay hathiyaar ke rup main istemaal karti hai
 The judges said, the easiest way to harass is to arrest the husband and his relatives under this provision
 anek maamalon main pati ke ashakt dada-daadi, videsh main dashakon se rahane vaali unki bahanon ko bhi giraftaar kiya gaya
 The Court held that the arrest impedes and offends the liberty of the person and stains him forever and no arrest should be made merely because the offense is non-bailable and cognizable
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha, giraftaar karne kaa adhikaar ek baat he or iske istemaal ko nyyochit tehraana duusari baat he

 Buddhadev said that he would meet the Prime Minister after he returned from his visit to America and Brazil
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen apni ranneeti or yojanaon par purnvichaar karnaa hoga

 input-ians Amid fresh fragrance of alliance with Congress in Delhi, Aam Aadmi Party has once again reiterated the need to contest elections alone
 haal hi main dilli congress ke netaa pisi chaako ne aam aadmi party ke saath gathbandhan kii baat ko jaij tehraaya tha
 After which Aaj Tak asked AAP leader Gopal Rai in a special conversation whether the path of alliance with Congress in Delhi is cleared now? In response, Rai said that instead of contesting elections, the Congress is stuck in its own confusion
 raay ne kaha ki aachaar samhita lagu hone ke saath hi chunaav kaa samay nazadik aa rahaa he
 Meanwhile, Sheila Dixit, PC Chacko and Rahul Gandhi are making different statements, in such a situation, the Congress should clarify its opinion about the alliance
 unhone kaha ki shila dikshit ne rahul gandhi se baithak ke baad kaha tha ki unki party aam aadmi party se gathbandhan nahin karegi
 After this statement by Sheila Dixit, the Aam Aadmi Party decided that the time is very short, so 6 candidates have been announced and the Aam Aadmi Party has started the campaign with its candidates from 1 March
 iske alaava congress netaa ke bayaan par jab poocha gaya ki kya aam aadmi party gathbandhan ke liye ek kadam aage badhaane kii koshish karegi? gopal raay ne jawaab main kaha ki aam aadmi party ko ek kadam aage jane kii zarurat nahin he
 Elections are on the head and the Aam Aadmi Party has taken the decision to land alone on the electoral ground in view of the Congress dilemma
 gopal raay se poocha gaya ki kya congress ke saath gathbandhan kii koi gunjaaish nahin he? gopal raay ne kaha ki gathbandhan ke bare main ham nahin soch rahe hai, aam aadmi party kaa focus loksabhaa chunaav kii ladaai ladanaa or jeetna he
 He said that recently Sheila Dixit praised Narendra Modi and then Ajay Maken is also making a different statement
 aisa lagata he ki congress 2019 chunaav ke maidan main utarana hi nahin chaahati
 Therefore, the Aam Aadmi Party will work to remove the dictatorial government from the country and is preparing a strategy to contest elections on its own in Delhi
 gopal raay ne daawa kiya ki philhal congress ke saath koi baatcheet nahin chal rahi he
 The Aam Aadmi Party will contest alone on all seats
 gopal raay kaa kahana he ki gathbandhan par congress sirf bayaan de rahi he, abhi koi aadhikarik baatcheet nahin hui he
 In such a situation, the Aam Aadmi Party will fight the Lok Sabha elections along with the people of Delhi instead of wasting their energy in the cycle of statements of Congress

 pustak sarahindi rangamanch kii aadhi shatee ko cover karti yah kitaab naatak kii aalochana par kendrit na hokar manch prastuti par aadhaarit he
 Jaydev Taneja has been an audience, observer and critic of almost every drama staged here since 1960, living in Delhi
 naatak or rangamanch kii duniya se is lagaav kaa hi nateeja he rang sakshi
 In true sense, it is based on stage performances rather than on drama criticism
 naatak jaisi vidha par vichaar-vimarsh kaa shaayad yahi sahi rasta he
 If we talk only on the play article, then the presence of theatrical elements and possibilities in it cannot be ignored
 chaar khandon kii kitaab main bhartiya visheshtah hindi rangamanch kii lagbhag aadhi shatee ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 From this point of view, this source material is of utmost importance for theater researchers as well as general audiences

 The first section contains detailed articles on five plays written on the pretext of his productions
 ye naatak haih asadha kaa ek din, aadhe adhure, tughlaq, andhaa yug or charandas chor
 The presentation of these plays has been a notable phenomenon in Hindi theater
 charandas chor prastuti ke rup main bhale charchit hua lekin uske aalekh par zyada vimarsh nahin hua
 If every play in this list was of Vijay Tendulkar and Badal Sarkar, then this picture of Indian theater would have been completed

 For such reports, the author has used the word Veeksha, which needs to be taken notice of
 yon shabd kii avadharana se zyada is khand main uplabdh saamagree ke dastaveji mahatv ko dhyaan main rakhaa janaa chahie
 In the last twenty-five years, there has been a flood of theater performances in Indian theater

 That era has become rare when a theater team stages a play according to their wishes, their resources and their schedule

 a transgender couple in Kolkata got married on Monday
 kolkata main LGBT samudaay ke liye ‘renbo vaiding’ kaa apni tarah kaa ye pehla vakya he
 Teesta Das and Deepan Chakraborty announced their marriage in April this year
 38 varshiya tista kolkata ke transgender samudaay kaa janaa pahachaanaa naam hai
 He has also acted in films and TV
 vahiin 40 varshiya deepan kaa taalluk assam ke lumding se he
 Teesta and Deepan met a few years ago
 is saal april main ‘transgender de of visibility’ par donon ne jeevanasathi banane kaa faisla kiya
 Click here to pay tribute to Sushma Swaraj, tell that Teesta's name is the achievement of being the first transsexual woman in Bengal to have a voter icard
 tista ne kaha, “ham sab ullasit hai, naa sirf main wo har shaks jisane hamen samarthan diya ullasit hai
 It was a very difficult journey
 hamen kadi saamaajik roodhiyon kaa saamana karnaa tha
 Therefore, this day has special significance in our lives
 kya nayaa judaa he wo ye tathy he ki ham apana jeevanasathi chun sakate hai
 Deepan does not get tired of expressing happiness
 deepan kehete hai, 'ye nai shuruyaat ke liye uthaaya gaya chota kadam he
 This is a new beginning not only in our life but for the whole society
 ham sirf ummid karte hai ki isse sandesh jayega or logon ko ahsaas hoga ki ham bhi insaan hai
 i can only hope that people's mindset will change and people will come out of fear
 'deepan kaa parivaar jahaan is aayojan se dur rahaa
 At the same time, Teesta's mother strongly supported her
 tista kaa janm kolkata ke upnagar main sushanto das yani ladke ke taur par hua
 In childhood, Teesta became diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria
 2004 main tista ne sex change (sex riasinament surgery- SRS) ke baad khud ko trans-vooman ke taur par pahchaan di
 Since then Teesta has been raising her voice for the rights of transsexuals
 is vishay main jitani bhi bhrantiyaan or purvaagrah the, tista ne har maukey par unhen chunauti deen
 a large number of people from Kolkata's transgender community participated in Teesta and Deepan's wedding
 pashchim bengal transgender board kii sadsy ranjita sinha ne bhi tista or deepan ko badhai di
 Sinha said, “I joined this marriage because Teesta is a long-time comrade in our struggle
 main unki nijee pasand ke liye khush hum lekin saath hi ye fikr bhi he ki transgender adhikaron ko mahila adhikaron se jodne kaa bhram ho saktaa he
 Why does the trans-woman need to accept patriarchy for social equality? ” sinha ke mutabik transgenders ko ab bhi viraasat jaise zyaadaatar adhikaar hasil nahin he jo anya kisi naagarik ko hasil hote hai
 Sinha said, "when we do not have access to health, education and employment, i fear that the media's focus on this single transgender marriage may be counter to our real fight
" hamen apni bade sangharsh se dhyaan nahin hatane dena chahie

 He has kept all the expectations from the free basics
 yah ek nayaa plateform he jo pehali martabaa internet kaa istemaal karne waalon ke saamne khaas taur par gramin bharat main kuch chuninda websiton tak pahunch banayega taaki bharat main internet ke ek arab nae upabhokta khadey kiye ja saken
 Despite the blatant assertion that "free basics" is a philanthropic effort to reach the internet to those who cannot afford it yet, the effort is viewed with suspicion
 start-ap companiyon ke pravartakon, shikshavidon or kai logon ke virodh ke kaaran yah yojana philhal ataki padi he kyonki in logon kii chintaa he ki yah nayaa plateform chupake-chupake karodon garib bharatiyon kii digital pahunch ko hathiyaa legaa or upabhoktaaon par niyantran kar legaa
 The Telecom Banning Authority of India (TRAI) has put a moratorium on the scheme at present, due to opposition from those who believe that the entry of free basics could hamper India's freedom of access to the Internet
 use janvari ke ant tak is par faisla karke siforishein pesh kerani hai
 But Zuckerberg and Free Basics have launched a vigorous publicity campaign in which advertisements are being published in newspapers and online campaigns are being run by Facebook consumers to influence TRAI
 isamen ve jor daal rahe hai ki free basics ke marfat internet kaa ek simit swaroop muft uplabdh karaayaa ja rahaa he jisamen fasebuk kii soshal netwarking site or massej sevaaon ke saath-saath khabaren, swasthya, naukari kii kuch chuninda websiten or kheti-baadi kii jaankariyaan uplabdh karai jaaengi
 Free Basics said in a message to Facebook consumers that "it helps people who don't have the ability to pay for data or who need help to get started online
" or yah sabake liye khuli he
 "just a few months after it was launched last year when it was named Internet
 oarji se badalakar free basics kiya gaya to fasebuk ne isko lekar tamaam ashankaon ko dur karne kii koshish kii thi
 She indicated that the platform is not just for the websites and services she will choose but is open to all developers provided they meet the platform's technical standards
 lekin yah maanak ek aisi company se tay kiye ja rahe hai jiske paas bhavishya main kabhi bhi in maanakon ko badalane kaa adhikaar he
 Critics argue that regardless of whether it is accepted or not, the initiative would have been viewed positively if it had provided free and full Internet access to the poor by subsidizing telecom service providers
 haalanki fasebuk ne is tathy ko chipaaya nahin he ki free basics darasal ek vyavsaay he jiske apane aarthik hit hai
 That is why it has tied up with Reliance Communications for nationwide outreach
 jahaan uskaa iraadaa online vigyaapan rajasav ke mote hisse ko hathiyanna he, vahiin reliance kaa makasad apni data sevaaon ke liye or zyada upabhokta hasil karnaa he
 Opponents argue that this service does not guarantee net-neutrality
 unka maananaa he ki free basics kaa asal makasad use mil rahe upabhokta data kaa str badhaakar bhavishya main usase vanijyik laabh hasil karne kaa he
 Then, due to lack of privacy law, there is also a risk of misuse of all such information
 tamaam iity or indian institute of science, bangaluru ke vaigyanikon ne bhi fasebuk ke model par sawaal uthaae hai or kaha he ki yah soshal network apane basics ap main saare content ko akut (saarvajanik) kar detaa he jo ki yugers kii suraksha ke liye khatra ho saktaa he
 Other opponents point out that providing free access to only a few websites discourages people from using the rest of the services and goes against the spirit of net-neutrality

 5 Star Artists: Salman Khan, Sonam Kapoor, Anupam Kher, Swara Bhaskar, Neil Nitin Mukesh and Armaan kohlidirector: Suraj Barjatyasalaman Khan has brought the gift of Prem Ratan Dhan Payo to his loved ones on Diwali, but the film has increased rather than removing the fatigue after Diwali
 She gives
 suraj badjatya lambey samay baad salmaan ke saath laute hai, isliye unhone salmaan ko puri tarah cash karaane kii koshish kii, lekin is chakkar main vah kahani se puri tarah bhatak gaye
 Perhaps he is adopting the same era of filmmaking he used to adopt two decades ago
 lekin us jamaane main ve ek kahani bhi lekar chalate the jo is baar puri tarah se missing he
 He is seen riding completely on Salman Khan's star power
 jahaan tak salmaan kii baat he to unamem vah madda he ki vah apane phans ko cinemagharon tak khinch sake
 But the whistling of the seats from Front Row indicates that perhaps this is not the thing they are crazy about for Salman's diehard fans
 kah sakate hai ki yah salmaan kii pichhali ai filmon main se sabase kamjor he
 How powerful the story is of a princely state
 jiskaa ek yuvaraj he
 Which has some enemies
 uskaa bhai uskaa dushman he
 Bahi is angry with him
 mashooqa bhi khafa he
 That is, everything is spoiled
 ek haadasa hota he
 And then Yuvraj replaces Vijay, a common man's love
 bas vah sab kuch sahi kar detaa he
 It has often been seen that serialized people use the stories of films in their serials, but Prem Ratan Dhan Payo is something like watching a serial epic episode
 kahani ke naam par kuch nahin, koi bhi kairactor dil main utar nahin paata he or prem ke rup main doosraa bajrangi najar aata he
 Sooraj Barjatyako, who made trendsetting films like Hum Aapke Hain Koun and i Pyaar Kiya, should have worked a little harder on the story front, and would have to learn to move with the times
 rajshri kii har film main paariwarik match hota he to is baar footbal match he
 Star Appeal: Every actor of this film seems to be trying to be something extra soft
 salmaan se lekar anupam kher tak
 Everyone tries to be very family
 salmaan aksar jaisi acting karte hai unhone waisi hi acting kii he
 There is only one thing that can be seen in the film, but what can Salman also do when the content is nothing
 sonam kapur ke bare main itnaa hi kah sakate hai ki ve paaramparik paridhaanon main bahut acchhee lagi hai
 Swara Bhaskar got a chance, he is fine
 diarector samaj hi nahin paae ki deepak dobariyaal se karwaanaa kya he
 No character is worth remembering
 kamai kii batsalmaan or rajshri kii filmon kii khaasiyat uskaa sangitaraha he, chaahe jitne gane hon film main boriyat nahin hoti thi, lekin prem ratan dhan payo ke ek-do gane chhod den to baaki bor karne kaa kaam karte hai
 The budget of the film is said to be around 125 crores, so the film will have to work hard at the box office
 vaise festival weekend he, or kaaphi chhuttiyaan bhi hai or salmaan hai
 So Salman is not going to face much trouble
 lekin is film se asal phayda shahrukh khan ko hoga kyonki unki aane vaali film “dilavaale” he, or salmaan kaa naam he prem dilavaale
 
 
 In Delhi, the genie of the poster of former BJP national organization General Secretary Sanjay Joshi has come out once again
 poster ke jariye ishaaron-ishaaron main pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa gaya he
 According to Sanjay Joshi's supporters, when the Prime Minister can talk to Bangladesh and Pakistan, then why not Sanjay Joshi
 khaas baat yah he ki yeposterrashtriya rajdhani dilli main piem awaas 7-aarasiar, bijepi adhyaksha amit shah, bijepi netaa laalkrishna adwani or congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke awaas ke kareeb lagaae gaye hai
 Apart from this, posters related to Sanjay Joshi have also been installed in many other places
 kya likhaa he poster mensanjay joshike poster main likhaa hua he, 'pakistan or bangladesh ko dete ho ramajaan kii badhai sushamaa, adwani, sanjay joshi ,rajnath, gadakari, murali manohar joshi, vasundhara ke liye man main he khatai
 'after this, it is written just below,' Na dialogue, na man ki baat, na sabka saath, na sab ki vikas ya kar kar aayega, trusting you? And Sanjay Joshi is shown alone in the poster
 nivedak ke rup main neeche kai logon kaa naam hai
 These hoardings have also been placed outside the home of External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj
 pehle bhi kiya he poster varayah pehali baar nahin he jab sanjay joshi ke samarthakon ne is prakaar ke poster lagaae hai
 Earlier in April, as soon as Prime Minister Narendra Modi returned to the country from his trip to France, Germany and Canada, his supporters, who were considered as staunch anti-bjp leaders, attacked poster posters
 tab ye poster bijepi mukhyalay, laalkrishna adwani or party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke ghar ke baahar lagaae gaye the
 Those posters and hoardings demanded Sanjay Joshi's return home
 jabaki vivaad badhane par un postaron ko turant hataa liya gaya tha
 What was written earlier, along with the demands of Sanjay Joshi's return to the posters and hoardings, it was written earlier, 'if the thing is the best, then listen to our mind
 ’ hordings par likhaa he ‘sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas to phir kyon nahin sanjay joshi kaa saath?’ Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni should rest for a few days
 ye kahana he team india ke purv captain saurav ganguli kaa
 Sourav Ganguly has said that these days Mahendra Singh Dhoni is playing cricket continuously and playing in all formats
 lekin ab vakt aa gaya he jab unhen thode din aaraam lenaa chahie
 According to Ganguly, if Ganguly does not rest before the tour of Australia, then the condition of Team India in Australia can be similar to the tour of England
 jis samay sena or police patel andolankariyon kii hinsa ko niyantrit karne ke liye ahmedabad kii sadakon par utar rahi thi, usee shaam dilli main modi sarkaar kii cabinet baithak se obisi kii kendriya suchi main sanshodhan kii khabar aa rahi thi
 The central government has included two castes from Gujarat and Uttarakhand in the OBC list
 sipai or patni jamaat gujarat kii obisi suchi main pehle se shaamil hai
 Both these communities are poor OBC castes
 donon main kuch hindu hote hai or kuch muslim hote hai
 Just as some Rajputs in Western Uttar Pradesh are Hindus and some are Muslims
 obisi kota main shaamil kiye jane kii maang karne vaale patel naujavaanon ko sochna chahie ki sipai or patni jamaat ne to lakhon kii raily nahin kii phir bhi inhen gujarat or ab centre kii obisi suchi main jagah kaise mil gai
 Can Patel also be equivalent to these castes on socioeconomic grounds
 dikkat yah he ki ham copiraiteron ke likhe vigyaapan main dekh netaaon ko louh purush maanane lage hai, lekin sabko samajhnaa chahie ki aarakshan kaa aadhaar aarthik karne ke liye unamem raajnneetik saahas nahin he
 Until this happens, the basis of reservation will be caste discrimination and on this scale Patel youth are exploiters or they have to think for themselves
 aaj bhi samaaj kii kai jatiyaan is bhedbhaav ko bhugat rahi hai
 In Gujarat itself, the incidence of rape of Dalit girls has increased by 500 percent
 bihar main ek dalit ko mazaduri maangane par thresar main daal diya gaya
 Dalit grooms are not allowed to climb mares even today
 maine nahin dekha ki aarakshan virdohi twit karne vaale badi sankhya main aisi yaatnaaon ke khilaaf sadakon par nikle hon
 As soon as these questions come up, everyone becomes silent
 har samaaj main kuch amir or zyaadaatar garib hote hai
 People of Patel community have created many unbelievable stories of success with their hard work
 pardes jaakar bhaavnaatmak rup se visthapit bhi hue
 When they flee, no one says that the situation in Gujarat is bad
 bihar, upi kaa karata he to use maaraa-peeta jaataa he ki vahaan ke netaaon ne pardes ko lut liya he
 Therefore, the attitude of society towards a Bihari migrant and a Patel migrant is not the same even though both are persecuted of poverty
 jo bhi he patelon kii aarthik takat or aabaadi main atharah fisadi kii hissedari ne gujarat main raajnneetik rup se unhen prabhaavshaalee banaaya he
 People of this society have influence on all the resources of the state
 iske baavjood agar patel yuva yah cheekh-chikhakar kah rahaa he ki uski garibi dekhiye
 Seeing unemployment, i understand that his voice should be heard with sympathy
 lekin yahaan bhi bhedbhaav he
 If tribals or Muslims had come to the streets with these questions, what would have been the reaction of society and politics
 patel andolan par bijepi congress ne apane pravaktaa tivi studio nahin bheje lekin musalamaanon kii maang ke vakt bhi donon partiyaan chup rahati
 Patel himself also believes that there is truth in the allegations of social discrimination against other castes of Gujarat
 ahmedabad, surat or mehsana ke jin mohallon yaa ilaakon main hinsa hui he, unki detail nikaaliye
 Everyone says about the settlement of Muslims, but no one can see the Patel dominated areas in Ahmedabad and Surat
 patel bahul ilaake ke banane kii prakriya par bhi vichaar karnaa chahie
 How did it happen that Dalits did not get entry into apartments in Patel dominated areas
 obisi jatiyon ko bhi naam maatr hi pravesh mila
 Many Patel youth said that it is changing
 lekin police bhi ahmedabad ke bapunagar ko patel bahul ilaake ke rup main jaanati he
 a woman from Matruchaya Sosoyati told our colleague Rajeev Pathak that the police came inside
 ghar main ghuskar ham sabko maaraa he
 The media also said that there were reports of violence and confrontation from Patel-dominated areas
 ahmedabad or surat jaise kaarobaari shaharon main patelon kaa apana ilaaka bataa rahaa he ki aarthik or raajnneetik aatmavishvaas ke kaaran ve alag ilaaka basaa sakate hai
 This is the reason why both his richness and his voice are seen and heard, but what has happened is that the society which cannot share the flat next to his apartment with any Dalit and OBC wants to see himself with their names in the OBC list
 is
 thik he ki patel naujavaanon kii raily main aarakshan kii maang hui to yah bhi utane hi zordaar tareeke se kaha gaya ki aarakshan samaapt kar diya jaae
 Such demands are seen in Delhi but no political party has adopted them
 aarakshan mitaane kii maang kar patel apni raajnneetik takat kho denge
 obcs and Dalits will come together and then no one will openly support their demand
 kya patel noujvaan is jokhim ke liye taiyaar hai
 Due to this risk, Patel is not supporting the MLA
 phir bhi patel naujavaanon kii baat suni jaani chahie
 His truth is coming out from his words which is often not seen due to the overall identity of Hindutva
 bhale hi duusare samaaj kii bhi yahi vyathaa ho magar patel naujavaanon ne awaz uthaane kii pahal to kii hi he
 If he left the reservation and would have gone on these questions, then today probably would have been another situation
 jo bhi he berojgaare or kheti ke sankat ke sawaal patel naujavaanon ke hi nahin hai
 Belongs to everyone
 patel naujavaanon kaa andolan jitna gujarat sarkaar ke khilaaf he utana hi apane samaaj ke netritv ke khilaaf bhi
 There are forty Patel mlas in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly
 mukhyamantri bhi patel hai or unke alaava kai mantri bhi
 Even after this, no one supported the Patel youth
 aarakshan kaa sawaal mushkil tha to mahangi fees to kam kii hi ja sakati thi
 It takes a long time, but in the end everyone starts to see that people who become leaders in the name of Patel Brahmin or Yadav are useful to the party and not to the society
 patel naujavaanon ko yah dikh gaya he ki patel vidhayak naam ke hi hai
 The voice was the same in Gujarat
 us awaz ne jiske sir par haath rakhaa logon ne use nahin dekha, narendra modi ko dekhakar vot de diya
 You may count these voiceless leaders as forty patels or seventy patels, but everyone's silence is telling that if there is not one, it does not matter much
 yahi kaaran he ki kai jagahon par patel mantriyon se lekar vidhayakon ke ghar or karyaalayon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Violence took place in Patel-dominated areas and the houses and party offices of Patel leaders were vandalized there
 oonja main bijepi vidhayak narayan bhai patel ke daftar main aag laga di gai
 Narayan Bhai Patel is an eminent leader of the society
 grahamantri rajani patel ke ghar ko jalaane kaa prayaas hua
 Mehsana MP Jayashree Ben Patel's house was also attacked
 mukhyamantri anandiben patel ko apane nivas kii suraksha badhaani padi
 The house of Nitin Patel, considered number two in the Gujarat government, also got crowded
 visanagar ke bijepi ke vidhayak ke ghar hamalaa hua
 The problem is second to Patel mlas
 unhen lagata he ki gujarat main bijepi kaa or bijepi main hi unka raajnneetik bhavishya he
 The politics of Hindutva has led him to a closed path
 ab ve is party main apni sthiti banaae rakhana chaahate hai
 Therefore silent
 saamne nahin aa rahe hai, lekin nichle str ke patel netaaon main bechaini bad rahi he
 There have been reports of councilors or panchayat members resigning from some places
 rajkot ke paas jasdan taluka panchayat ke kuch patel sadasyon ne istipha diya he
 Bechar Bhadani, vice-president of BJP Kisan Morcha, has resigned from the post
 ve patel naujavaanon kii maang kaa samarthan karne lage hai
 Meanwhile, more than 125 private engineering colleges opened in a small state like Gujarat
 zyaadaatar santhaan patel logon ke hi hai
 These colleges have more than 60,000 seats
 indian express kii report ke anusaar chah sarkari ejineering kalejon main is saal ek bhi seat khaali nahin he, lekin privet kalejon main yogyata niyamon main dheel dene ke baad bhi 22,000 se adhik siten khaali rah gayi
 The vice-chancellor of Gujarat University has told the Indian Express that the fees of self-financed colleges have become so expensive that that too could be a reason
 amir patelon ne samaaj kii sankhya ke dam par satta se laabh lekar skool kalege to khol liye magar fees badha kar apane hi samaaj ke ladakon par karze kaa boj daal diya
 As a result, the Patel youth started paying fees on the loan or they went on paying the fees
 yahi haal duusare samaaj kaa bhi hua hoga magar shaayad unke bich patelon jaisaa aatmavishvaas nahin hoga ki ve gujarat sarkaar kii ghanti baja sakate hai
 Those who turned out to be engineers were not resolved even after getting jobs
 kuch berojgaar rah gaye or kuch ko mili behad kam tankhwaah
 Now this will not be solved by reservation
 aarakshan ke baad bhi ye samasya rahegi
 Someone wrote on Facebook that in May 2015, there were 143 recruitments for the post of peon in Rajasthan
 krishi vibhaag ke saamne 77000 aavedan aa gaye
 This is the reality of Bihar UP or any state
 berojgaar ubal rahe hai magar rasta nahin mil rahaa
 Hindus jump into Muslim fire but do not get a job even after being Hindu
 raajnneeti bachane ke nae-nae raste khoj leti he or log raat andhere main rasta khojane lagate hai
 The comments yahi kaaran tha ki 25 agast kii raily se pehle kii raat ahmedabad ke mohallon main badi sankhya main auraten bhi nikal kar ain
 These women know the suffering of their sons
 agar bijepi kii hindutv raajnneeti ne patelon ko aatmavishvaas yaa sangrakshan nahin diya hota to patel bhi chup hi rah jate
 Therefore a situation of conflict arose between the new and old Patels
 patel naujavaanon agar aarakshan ke sawaal par ade rahe to iskaa mit janaa tay he
 If their questions turn into privatization of jobs and education and better prices of crops, they can achieve a lot
 apane liye bhi or dusron ke liye bhi
 Yogendra Yadav has rightly said, everybody is looking for a way to escape
 aarakshan aasaan jawaab nahin he
 If anyone feels that the time has come for the reservation to end, then ask a question to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi
 unka jawaab abhi bataa detaa hum
 We believe that reservations are necessary and there will be no change
 bahes to tabhi shuru hogi jab ye netaa pahal karenge
 Otherwise no debate will be recognized
 inaki eemaandaaree kaa imtihaan ye bhi he ki aarthik aadhaar par garib savarnon ke aarakshan dene ke sawaal par kam se kam pahal to karke dikhaaen
 Everyone agrees on this
 obisi kota main shaamil kiye jane kii maang karne vaale patel naujavaanon ko sochna chahie ki sipai or patni jamaat ne to lakhon kii raily nahin kii phir bhi inhen gujarat or ab centre kii obisi suchi main jagah kaise mil gai
 Can Patel also be equivalent to these castes on socioeconomic grounds
 dikkat yah he ki ham copiraiteron ke likhe vigyaapan main dekh netaaon ko louh purush maanane lage hai, lekin sabko samajhnaa chahie ki aarakshan kaa aadhaar aarthik karne ke liye unamem raajnneetik saahas nahin he
 Until this happens, the basis of reservation will be caste discrimination and on this scale Patel youth are exploiters or they have to think for themselves
 aaj bhi samaaj kii kai jatiyaan is bhedbhaav ko bhugat rahi hai
 In Gujarat itself, the incidence of rape of Dalit girls has increased by 500 percent
 bihar main ek dalit ko mazaduri maangane par thresar main daal diya gaya
 Dalit grooms are not allowed to climb mares even today
 maine nahin dekha ki aarakshan virdohi twit karne vaale badi sankhya main aisi yaatnaaon ke khilaaf sadakon par nikle hon
 As soon as these questions come up, everyone becomes silent
 har samaaj main kuch amir or zyaadaatar garib hote hai
 People of Patel community have created many unbelievable stories of success with their hard work
 pardes jaakar bhaavnaatmak rup se visthapit bhi hue
 When they flee, no one says that the situation in Gujarat is bad
 bihar, upi kaa karata he to use maaraa-peeta jaataa he ki vahaan ke netaaon ne pardes ko lut liya he

 lekin police bhi ahmedabad ke bapunagar ko patel bahul ilaake ke rup main jaanati he
 a woman from Matruchaya Sosoyati told our colleague Rajeev Pathak that the police came inside
 ghar main ghuskar ham sabko maaraa he
 The media also said that there were reports of violence and confrontation from Patel-dominated areas
 ahmedabad or surat jaise kaarobaari shaharon main patelon kaa apana ilaaka bataa rahaa he ki aarthik or raajnneetik aatmavishvaas ke kaaran ve alag ilaaka basaa sakate hai
 This is the reason why both his richness and his voice are seen and heard, but what has happened is that the society which cannot share the flat next to his apartment with any Dalit and OBC wants to see himself with their names in the OBC list
 is
 thik he ki patel naujavaanon kii raily main aarakshan kii maang hui to yah bhi utane hi zordaar tareeke se kaha gaya ki aarakshan samaapt kar diya jaae
 Such demands are seen in Delhi but no political party has adopted them
 aarakshan mitaane kii maang kar patel apni raajnneetik takat kho denge
 obcs and Dalits will come together and then no one will openly support their demand
 kya patel noujvaan is jokhim ke liye taiyaar hai
 Due to this risk, Patel is not supporting the MLA
 phir bhi patel naujavaanon kii baat suni jaani chahie
 His truth is coming out from his words which is often not seen due to the overall identity of Hindutva
 bhale hi duusare samaaj kii bhi yahi vyathaa ho magar patel naujavaanon ne awaz uthaane kii pahal to kii hi he
 If he left the reservation and would have gone on these questions, then today probably would have been another situation
 jo bhi he berojgaare or kheti ke sankat ke sawaal patel naujavaanon ke hi nahin hai
 Belongs to everyone
 patel naujavaanon kaa andolan jitna gujarat sarkaar ke khilaaf he utana hi apane samaaj ke netritv ke khilaaf bhi
 There are forty Patel mlas in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly
 mukhyamantri bhi patel hai or unke alaava kai mantri bhi
 Even after this, no one supported the Patel youth
 aarakshan kaa sawaal mushkil tha to mahangi fees to kam kii hi ja sakati thi
 It takes a long time, but in the end everyone starts to see that people who become leaders in the name of Patel Brahmin or Yadav are useful to the party and not to the society
 patel naujavaanon ko yah dikh gaya he ki patel vidhayak naam ke hi hai
 The voice was the same in Gujarat
 us awaz ne jiske sir par haath rakhaa logon ne use nahin dekha, narendra modi ko dekhakar vot de diya
 You may count these voiceless leaders as forty patels or seventy patels, but everyone's silence is telling that if there is not one, it does not matter much
 yahi kaaran he ki kai jagahon par patel mantriyon se lekar vidhayakon ke ghar or karyaalayon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Violence took place in Patel-dominated areas and the houses and party offices of Patel leaders were vandalized there
 oonja main bijepi vidhayak narayan bhai patel ke daftar main aag laga di gai
 Narayan Bhai Patel is an eminent leader of the society
 grahamantri rajani patel ke ghar ko jalaane kaa prayaas hua
 Mehsana MP Jayashree Ben Patel's house was also attacked
 mukhyamantri anandiben patel ko apane nivas kii suraksha badhaani padi
 The house of Nitin Patel, considered number two in the Gujarat government, also got crowded
 visanagar ke bijepi ke vidhayak ke ghar hamalaa hua
 The problem is second to Patel mlas
 unhen lagata he ki gujarat main bijepi kaa or bijepi main hi unka raajnneetik bhavishya he
 The politics of Hindutva has led him to a closed path
 ab ve is party main apni sthiti banaae rakhana chaahate hai
 Therefore silent
 saamne nahin aa rahe hai, lekin nichle str ke patel netaaon main bechaini bad rahi he
 There have been reports of councilors or panchayat members resigning from some places
 rajkot ke paas jasdan taluka panchayat ke kuch patel sadasyon ne istipha diya he
 Bechar Bhadani, vice-president of BJP Kisan Morcha, has resigned from the post
 ve patel naujavaanon kii maang kaa samarthan karne lage hai
 Meanwhile, more than 125 private engineering colleges opened in a small state like Gujarat
 zyaadaatar santhaan patel logon ke hi hai
 These colleges have more than 60,000 seats
 indian express kii report ke anusaar chah sarkari ejineering kalejon main is saal ek bhi seat khaali nahin he, lekin privet kalejon main yogyata niyamon main dheel dene ke baad bhi 22,000 se adhik siten khaali rah gayi
 The vice-chancellor of Gujarat University has told the Indian Express that the fees of self-financed colleges have become so expensive that that too could be a reason
 amir patelon ne samaaj kii sankhya ke dam par satta se laabh lekar skool kalege to khol liye magar fees badha kar apane hi samaaj ke ladakon par karze kaa boj daal diya
 As a result, the Patel youth started paying fees on the loan or they went on paying the fees
 yahi haal duusare samaaj kaa bhi hua hoga magar shaayad unke bich patelon jaisaa aatmavishvaas nahin hoga ki ve gujarat sarkaar kii ghanti baja sakate hai
 Those who turned out to be engineers were not resolved even after getting jobs
 kuch berojgaar rah gaye or kuch ko mili behad kam tankhwaah
 Now this will not be solved by reservation
 aarakshan ke baad bhi ye samasya rahegi
 Someone wrote on Facebook that in May 2015, there were 143 recruitments for the post of peon in Rajasthan
 krishi vibhaag ke saamne 77000 aavedan aa gaye
 This is the reality of Bihar UP or any state
 berojgaar ubal rahe hai magar rasta nahin mil rahaa
 Hindus jump into Muslim fire but do not get a job even after being Hindu
 raajnneeti bachane ke nae-nae raste khoj leti he or log raat andhere main rasta khojane lagate hai
 The comments yahi kaaran tha ki 25 agast kii raily se pehle kii raat ahmedabad ke mohallon main badi sankhya main auraten bhi nikal kar ain
 These women know the suffering of their sons
 agar bijepi kii hindutv raajnneeti ne patelon ko aatmavishvaas yaa sangrakshan nahin diya hota to patel bhi chup hi rah jate
 Therefore a situation of conflict arose between the new and old Patels
 patel naujavaanon agar aarakshan ke sawaal par ade rahe to iskaa mit janaa tay he
 If their questions turn into privatization of jobs and education and better prices of crops, they can achieve a lot
 apane liye bhi or dusron ke liye bhi
 Yogendra Yadav has rightly said, everybody is looking for a way to escape
 aarakshan aasaan jawaab nahin he
 If anyone feels that the time has come for the reservation to end, then ask a question to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi
 unka jawaab abhi bataa detaa hum
 We believe that reservations are necessary and there will be no change
 bahes to tabhi shuru hogi jab ye netaa pahal karenge
 Otherwise no debate will be recognized
 inaki eemaandaaree kaa imtihaan ye bhi he ki aarthik aadhaar par garib savarnon ke aarakshan dene ke sawaal par kam se kam pahal to karke dikhaaen
 Everyone agrees on this
 jo bhi he patelon kii aarthik takat or aabaadi main atharah fisadi kii hissedari ne gujarat main raajnneetik rup se unhen prabhaavshaalee banaaya he
 People of this society have influence on all the resources of the state
 iske baavjood agar patel yuva yah cheekh-chikhakar kah rahaa he ki uski garibi dekhiye
 Seeing unemployment, i understand that his voice should be heard with sympathy
 lekin yahaan bhi bhedbhaav he
 If tribals or Muslims had come to the streets with these questions, what would have been the reaction of society and politics
 patel andolan par bijepi congress ne apane pravaktaa tivi studio nahin bheje lekin musalamaanon kii maang ke vakt bhi donon partiyaan chup rahati
 Patel himself also believes that there is truth in the allegations of social discrimination against other castes of Gujarat
 ahmedabad, surat or mehsana ke jin mohallon yaa ilaakon main hinsa hui he, unki detail nikaaliye
 Everyone says about the settlement of Muslims, but no one can see the Patel dominated areas in Ahmedabad and Surat
 patel bahul ilaake ke banane kii prakriya par bhi vichaar karnaa chahie
 How did it happen that Dalits did not get entry into apartments in Patel dominated areas
 obisi jatiyon ko bhi naam maatr hi pravesh mila
 Many Patel youth said that it is changing
 lekin police bhi ahmedabad ke bapunagar ko patel bahul ilaake ke rup main jaanati he
 a woman from Matruchaya Sosoyati told our colleague Rajeev Pathak that the police came inside

 Everyone agrees on this
 khud patel bhi maanate hai ki gujarat kii anya jatiyon se saamaajik bhedbhaav karne ke jo aarope lagate hai, usamen sachai he
 Find out the details of the violence or areas in Ahmedabad, Surat and Mehsana
 musalamaanon kii basti kii baat to sab kehete hai, lekin ahmedabad or surat main patel bahul ilaake kisi ko nazar nahin aate
 The process of formation of Patel dominated areas should also be considered
 kaise ho gaya ki patel bahul ilaakon ke apartment main daliton ko pravesh nahin mila
 OBC castes also got only admission
 kai patel yuvaaon ne kaha ki isamen badlaav aa rahaa he
 But the police also know Bapunagar of Ahmedabad as a Patel-dominated area
 maatruchhaaya sosoyati kii ek mahila ne hamaare sahyogi rajeev pathak ko bataaya ki police bheetar tak aa gai
 We have killed all of us by entering the house
 media bhi kehane laga ki patel bahul ilaakon se hinsa or takaraav kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 In business cities like Ahmedabad and Surat, the Patels have their own area telling that due to economic and political confidence they can settle in different areas
 yahi vajah he ki unki amiri or awaz donon dikhaai or sunai detii he, lekin aisa kya ho gaya ki jo samaaj apane apartment ke bagalvaala flats kisi dalit or obisi ke saath saajha nahin kar saktaa vah obisi suchi main inke naamon ke saath khud ko dekhnaa chahta he
 It is right that if there was a demand for reservation in the rally of Patel youth, then it was equally loud that the reservation should be abolished
 aisi maang karne vaale dilli main bhi dikhte hai magar kisi raajnneetik dal ne unhen nahin apanaaya
 Patel will lose his political power by demanding the abolition of reservation
 obisi or dalit ek taraf aa jaaenge or phir unki maang kaa koi khulkar samarthan bhi nahin karegaa
 Are Patel youngsters ready for this risk? isi jokhim ke kaaran patel vidhayak saath nahin de rahe hai
 Nevertheless, the Patel youth should be listened to
 unki baton se wo sachai saamne aa rahi he jo aksar hindutv kii samgr pahchaan ke kaaran nazar nahin aati
 Even if other societies have the same agony, the Patel youth have taken the initiative to raise their voice
 wo agar aarakshan chhod in sawaalon par nikalate to shaayad aaj duusari sthiti hoti
 Whatever it is, the questions of unemployment and the crisis of farming are not the same among the Patel youth
 sabake hai
 Patel youth movement is as much against the Gujarat government as it is against the leadership of their society
 gujarat vidhansabha main chalis patel vidhayak hai
 The Chief Minister is also a Patel and many ministers besides him
 iske baad bhi patel naujavaanon kaa kisi ne saath nahin diya
 If the question of reservation was difficult, then expensive fees could only be reduced
 kaaphi lanbaa vakt lag jaataa he magar ant main sabko dikhne hi lagata he ki patel brahman yaa yadav ke naam par netaa bane log party ke kaam aate hai, samaaj ke nahin
 Patel youths have seen that Patel is a legislator
 gujarat main awaz to ek hi thi
 The voice, which had a hand on its head, people did not see it, seeing Narendra Modi and voted
 in bivaaz netaaon ko aap bhale chalis patel yaa sattar patel main gin lijie, lekin sabaki khamoshi bataa rahi he ki ek bhi na hote to khaas fark nahin padataa
 This is the reason that in many places the houses and offices of Patel ministers to mlas were targeted
 hinsa patel bahul ilaakon main hi hui or vahaan patel netao ke ghar or party karyaalayon main todphod kii gai
 In Unjha, the office of BJP MLA Narayan Bhai Patel was set on fire
 narayan bhai patel samaaj ke pratishthit netaa hai
 There was an attempt to burn the house of Home Minister Rajni Patel
 mehsana kii saansad jayshri ben patel ke ghar par bhi hamalaa hua
 Chief Minister Anandiben Patel had to increase the security of her residence
 gujarat sarkaar main number do maane jane vaale nitin patel ke ghar bhi bheed pahunch gai
 BJP MLA from Visnagar attacked the house
 patel vidhayakon ke saamne dikkat duusari he
 They feel that BJP has a political future in Gujarat and BJP itself
 hindutv kii raajnneeti ne unhen band raste tak pahunchaa diya he
 Now they want to maintain their position in this party
 isliye chup hai
 They are not coming forward, but there is growing anxiety among lower level Patel leaders
 kuch jagahon se parshadon yaa panchayat sadasyon ke istipha dene kii khabaren ain hai
 Some Patel members of Jasdan Taluka Panchayat near Rajkot have resigned
 bijepi kisaan morcha ke upaadhyaksh bechar bhaadaani ne pad se istipha de diya he
 They have started supporting the demand of Patel youth
 is bich, gujarat jaise chote rajya main 125 se zyada privet ejineering college khul gaye
 Most of the institutes belong to the Patel people
 in collejon main 60,000 se zyada siten hai
 According to the report of Indian Express, not a single seat is vacant this year in six government engineering colleges, but in private colleges, more than 22,000 seats remained vacant even after the eligibility rules were relaxed
 gujarat vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati ne indian express se kaha he ki swaposhit collejon kii fees itani mahangi ho gai he ki vah bhi ek kaaran ho saktaa he
 The Amir Patels opened school colleges by taking advantage of the power on the strength of the society, but by increasing the fees, they put the burden of debt on the boys of their own society
 nateeja patel naujavaanon ne karz lekar fees bharani shuru kii yaa phir fees bharte bharte karz main chale gaye
 The same situation may have happened for other societies too, but perhaps they will not have the same confidence as the Patels that they can ring the bell of the Gujarat government
 jo ejeeniyar banakar nikle unka samaadhaan naukari paakar bhi nahin hua
 Some remained unemployed and some received extremely low salaries
 ab iskaa samaadhaan to aarakshan se nahin hoga
 Even after reservation, this problem will remain
 fasebuk par kisi ne likhaa he ki may 2015 main rajasthan main chaparasi ke pad ke liye 143 bhartiyon nikali thim
 77000 applications came before the Department of Agriculture
 yahi hakeekat bihar upi yaa kisi bhi rajya kii he
 The unemployed are boiling but cannot find a way
 hindu muslim kii aag main kud to jate hai magar hindu hokar bhi naukari nahin milti
 Politics finds new ways to escape and people find a way out in the dark of night
 tippaniyan This was the reason that a large number of women also came out in the mohallas of Ahmedabad on the night before the 25 August rally
 ye auraten apane beton kii takalif jaanati hai
 If bjp's Hindutva politics had not given Patel confidence or protection, Patel would have remained silent
 isliye nae or puraane patelon ke bich sangharsh kii sthiti paidaa ho gai
 If the Patel youth remains adamant on the question of reservation, then it is bound to disappear
 agar inke sawaal naukari or shiksha ke nijeekaran or fasalon ke behatar mulya main badalte hai to ye bahut kuch hasil kar sakate hai
 For myself as well as for others
 yogendra yadav ne thik hi kaha he, sab bachane kaa rasta khoj rahe hai
 Reservation is not the easy answer
 agar kisi ko lagata he ki aarakshan khatm hone kaa vakt aa gaya he to ek sawaal pradhanmantri narendra modi or congress netaa rahul gandhi se puch lijie
 i will answer them now
 ham maanate hai ki aarakshan zaruri he or isamen koi badlaav nahin hoga
 The debate will start only when these leaders take the initiative
 varna kisi bahes kii manyata nahin hogi
 Their test of honesty is also that they should at least show initiative on the question of giving reservation to poor upper castes on economic basis
 is par sabaki sahmati he

 It is right that if there was a demand for reservation in the rally of Patel youth, then it was equally loud that the reservation should be abolished
 aisi maang karne vaale dilli main bhi dikhte hai magar kisi raajnneetik dal ne unhen nahin apanaaya
 Patel will lose his political power by demanding the abolition of reservation
 obisi or dalit ek taraf aa jaaenge or phir unki maang kaa koi khulkar samarthan bhi nahin karegaa
 Are Patel youngsters ready for this risk? isi jokhim ke kaaran patel vidhayak saath nahin de rahe hai
 Nevertheless, the Patel youth should be listened to
 unki baton se wo sachai saamne aa rahi he jo aksar hindutv kii samgr pahchaan ke kaaran nazar nahin aati
 Even if other societies have the same agony, the Patel youth have taken the initiative to raise their voice
 wo agar aarakshan chhod in sawaalon par nikalate to shaayad aaj duusari sthiti hoti
 Whatever it is, the questions of unemployment and the crisis of farming are not the same among the Patel youth
 sabake hai
 Patel youth movement is as much against the Gujarat government as it is against the leadership of their society
 gujarat vidhansabha main chalis patel vidhayak hai
 The Chief Minister is also a Patel and many ministers besides him
 iske baad bhi patel naujavaanon kaa kisi ne saath nahin diya
 If the question of reservation was difficult, then expensive fees could only be reduced
 kaaphi lanbaa vakt lag jaataa he magar ant main sabko dikhne hi lagata he ki patel brahman yaa yadav ke naam par netaa bane log party ke kaam aate hai, samaaj ke nahin
 Patel youths have seen that Patel is a legislator
 gujarat main awaz to ek hi thi
 The voice, which had a hand on its head, people did not see it, seeing Narendra Modi and voted
 in bivaaz netaaon ko aap bhale chalis patel yaa sattar patel main gin lijie, lekin sabaki khamoshi bataa rahi he ki ek bhi na hote to khaas fark nahin padataa
 This is the reason that in many places the houses and offices of Patel ministers to mlas were targeted
 hinsa patel bahul ilaakon main hi hui or vahaan patel netao ke ghar or party karyaalayon main todphod kii gai
 In Unjha, the office of BJP MLA Narayan Bhai Patel was set on fire
 narayan bhai patel samaaj ke pratishthit netaa hai
 There was an attempt to burn the house of Home Minister Rajni Patel
 mehsana kii saansad jayshri ben patel ke ghar par bhi hamalaa hua
 Chief Minister Anandiben Patel had to increase the security of her residence
 gujarat sarkaar main number do maane jane vaale nitin patel ke ghar bhi bheed pahunch gai
 BJP MLA from Visnagar attacked the house
 patel vidhayakon ke saamne dikkat duusari he
 They feel that BJP has a political future in Gujarat and BJP itself

 Now they want to maintain their position in this party
 isliye chup hai
 They are not coming forward, but there is growing anxiety among lower level Patel leaders

 According to the report of Indian Express, not a single seat is vacant this year in six government engineering colleges, but in private colleges, more than 22,000 seats remained vacant even after the eligibility rules were relaxed
 gujarat vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati ne indian express se kaha he ki swaposhit collejon kii fees itani mahangi ho gai he ki vah bhi ek kaaran ho saktaa he
 The Amir Patels opened school colleges by taking advantage of the power on the strength of the society, but by increasing the fees, they put the burden of debt on the boys of their own society
 nateeja patel naujavaanon ne karz lekar fees bharani shuru kii yaa phir fees bharte bharte karz main chale gaye
 The same situation may have happened for other societies too, but perhaps they will not have the same confidence as the Patels that they can ring the bell of the Gujarat government
 jo ejeeniyar banakar nikle unka samaadhaan naukari paakar bhi nahin hua
 Some remained unemployed and some received extremely low salaries
 ab iskaa samaadhaan to aarakshan se nahin hoga

 Meanwhile, more than 125 private engineering colleges opened in a small state like Gujarat
 zyaadaatar santhaan patel logon ke hi hai
 These colleges have more than 60,000 seats
 indian express kii report ke anusaar chah sarkari ejineering kalejon main is saal ek bhi seat khaali nahin he, lekin privet kalejon main yogyata niyamon main dheel dene ke baad bhi 22,000 se adhik siten khaali rah gayi
 The vice-chancellor of Gujarat University has told the Indian Express that the fees of self-financed colleges have become so expensive that that too could be a reason
 amir patelon ne samaaj kii sankhya ke dam par satta se laabh lekar skool kalege to khol liye magar fees badha kar apane hi samaaj ke ladakon par karze kaa boj daal diya
 As a result, the Patel youth started paying fees on the loan or they went on paying the fees
 yahi haal duusare samaaj kaa bhi hua hoga magar shaayad unke bich patelon jaisaa aatmavishvaas nahin hoga ki ve gujarat sarkaar kii ghanti baja sakate hai
 Those who turned out to be engineers were not resolved even after getting jobs
 kuch berojgaar rah gaye or kuch ko mili behad kam tankhwaah
 Now this will not be solved by reservation
 aarakshan ke baad bhi ye samasya rahegi
 Someone wrote on Facebook that in May 2015, there were 143 recruitments for the post of peon in Rajasthan
 krishi vibhaag ke saamne 77000 aavedan aa gaye
 This is the reality of Bihar UP or any state
 berojgaar ubal rahe hai magar rasta nahin mil rahaa
 Hindus jump into Muslim fire but do not get a job even after being Hindu
 raajnneeti bachane ke nae-nae raste khoj leti he or log raat andhere main rasta khojane lagate hai
 The comments yahi kaaran tha ki 25 agast kii raily se pehle kii raat ahmedabad ke mohallon main badi sankhya main auraten bhi nikal kar ain
 These women know the suffering of their sons
 agar bijepi kii hindutv raajnneeti ne patelon ko aatmavishvaas yaa sangrakshan nahin diya hota to patel bhi chup hi rah jate
 Therefore a situation of conflict arose between the new and old Patels
 patel naujavaanon agar aarakshan ke sawaal par ade rahe to iskaa mit janaa tay he
 If their questions turn into privatization of jobs and education and better prices of crops, they can achieve a lot
 apane liye bhi or dusron ke liye bhi
 Yogendra Yadav has rightly said, everybody is looking for a way to escape
 aarakshan aasaan jawaab nahin he
 If anyone feels that the time has come for the reservation to end, then ask a question to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi
 unka jawaab abhi bataa detaa hum
 We believe that reservations are necessary and there will be no change
 bahes to tabhi shuru hogi jab ye netaa pahal karenge
 Otherwise no debate will be recognized
 inaki eemaandaaree kaa imtihaan ye bhi he ki aarthik aadhaar par garib savarnon ke aarakshan dene ke sawaal par kam se kam pahal to karke dikhaaen
 Everyone agrees on this
 amir patelon ne samaaj kii sankhya ke dam par satta se laabh lekar skool kalege to khol liye magar fees badha kar apane hi samaaj ke ladakon par karze kaa boj daal diya
 As a result, the Patel youth started paying fees on the loan or they went on paying the fees
 yahi haal duusare samaaj kaa bhi hua hoga magar shaayad unke bich patelon jaisaa aatmavishvaas nahin hoga ki ve gujarat sarkaar kii ghanti baja sakate hai

 Someone wrote on Facebook that in May 2015, there were 143 recruitments for the post of peon in Rajasthan
 krishi vibhaag ke saamne 77000 aavedan aa gaye
 This is the reality of Bihar UP or any state
 berojgaar ubal rahe hai magar rasta nahin mil rahaa
 Hindus jump into Muslim fire but do not get a job even after being Hindu
 raajnneeti bachane ke nae-nae raste khoj leti he or log raat andhere main rasta khojane lagate hai
 The comments yahi kaaran tha ki 25 agast kii raily se pehle kii raat ahmedabad ke mohallon main badi sankhya main auraten bhi nikal kar ain
 These women know the suffering of their sons
 agar bijepi kii hindutv raajnneeti ne patelon ko aatmavishvaas yaa sangrakshan nahin diya hota to patel bhi chup hi rah jate
 Therefore a situation of conflict arose between the new and old Patels
 patel naujavaanon agar aarakshan ke sawaal par ade rahe to iskaa mit janaa tay he
 If their questions turn into privatization of jobs and education and better prices of crops, they can achieve a lot
 apane liye bhi or dusron ke liye bhi
 Yogendra Yadav has rightly said, everybody is looking for a way to escape
 aarakshan aasaan jawaab nahin he
 If anyone feels that the time has come for the reservation to end, then ask a question to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi
 unka jawaab abhi bataa detaa hum
 We believe that reservations are necessary and there will be no change
 bahes to tabhi shuru hogi jab ye netaa pahal karenge
 Otherwise no debate will be recognized
 inaki eemaandaaree kaa imtihaan ye bhi he ki aarthik aadhaar par garib savarnon ke aarakshan dene ke sawaal par kam se kam pahal to karke dikhaaen
 Everyone agrees on this
 jo ejeeniyar banakar nikle unka samaadhaan naukari paakar bhi nahin hua
 Some remained unemployed and some received extremely low salaries
 ab iskaa samaadhaan to aarakshan se nahin hoga
 Even after reservation, this problem will remain
 fasebuk par kisi ne likhaa he ki may 2015 main rajasthan main chaparasi ke pad ke liye 143 bhartiyon nikali thim
 77000 applications came before the Department of Agriculture
 yahi hakeekat bihar upi yaa kisi bhi rajya kii he
 The unemployed are boiling but cannot find a way
 hindu muslim kii aag main kud to jate hai magar hindu hokar bhi naukari nahin milti
 Politics finds new ways to escape and people find a way out in the dark of night

 If bjp's Hindutva politics had not given Patel confidence or protection, Patel would have remained silent
 isliye nae or puraane patelon ke bich sangharsh kii sthiti paidaa ho gai
 If the Patel youth remains adamant on the question of reservation, then it is bound to disappear
 agar inke sawaal naukari or shiksha ke nijeekaran or fasalon ke behatar mulya main badalte hai to ye bahut kuch hasil kar sakate hai
 For myself as well as for others
 yogendra yadav ne thik hi kaha he, sab bachane kaa rasta khoj rahe hai
 Reservation is not the easy answer
 agar kisi ko lagata he ki aarakshan khatm hone kaa vakt aa gaya he to ek sawaal pradhanmantri narendra modi or congress netaa rahul gandhi se puch lijie
 i will answer them now
 ham maanate hai ki aarakshan zaruri he or isamen koi badlaav nahin hoga
 The debate will start only when these leaders take the initiative
 varna kisi bahes kii manyata nahin hogi
 Their test of honesty is also that they should at least show initiative on the question of giving reservation to poor upper castes on economic basis
 is par sabaki sahmati he

 So far during the pre-monsoon mountaineering season on Everest, 11 people have died, including three Indians
 kuchhek varshon se everest kii chadhaai kii tasviren hamen sahamaa rahi hai
 Long queues of mountaineers, whose flocks reach hundreds in clean weather, look like waiting for a herd of sheep on a clean-track body of the Himalayas
 is saal shikhar par pahunchane ko intjaar karti apaar bheed kii tasveeron or bottleband oxigen ke abhaav main parvatarohiyon ke marane kii khabaron ne sabko chaunkaa diya
 Usually, every year there are reports of death of a few mountaineers and the Sherpas carrying their goods on Everest, but they are not paid attention
 lekin jab koi mashhoor shaks gujarata he yaa badi sankhya main logon ke marane kii khabar pahunchati he to ghatana akhbaar kii surkhiyaan banati he
 The treacherous path of Everest and extremely difficult climb for any mountaineer, low oxygen wind, snow covered steep climbs, extreme weather changes, the risk of avalanches and rocks falling, glacier falls and dangerous cracks are the most
 There are big attractions
 lekin yahaan bhi bheed badaae kaa sankat shaayad hi kisi ke jehan main kaundha hoga
 Last year, 802 people reached the summit of Everest, so far the total number of people who climb Everest has been 8,306
 ke2 par ab tak 306 log hi pahunche hai
 First of all, know that out of the 18 climbing routes to reach the summit of Everest, only two are expected to have a stampede-like situation, as this is the easiest climb — the South Cole route from Nepal and the northeast peak from Tibet
 1990 ke baad jab nepal shaukia logon ko everest kii chadhaai kii suvidha dene ke liye paise ke bhugtan ke evaj main guide uplabdh karaane kii anumati dene laga to paise vaale log donon raaston main se kisi ek par apni jagah surakshit karaane lage
 Right now $ 35,000-75,000 per person (24
 3 lakh-52
 1 lakh Rs
 ) ke bhugtan par yah suvidha mil rahi he
 Guides are provided on the basis of the amount, whose job is to prepare the way on the icy sheet by means of rope and ladder, cook and put it to the peak by lifting the finger and put it down
 everest ke rahasy se prerit hokar 'chadhaai' kii parampara aaj amiron kaa shauk banati ja rahi he jo himalay kii aatma ko aahat kar rahi he
 How can any person claim victory on climbing the highest mountain on earth when his challenge of climbing with the discomfort of breathing is over as soon as the oxygen bottle lid is opened? In 1978, without the help of porter or bottled oxygen, Messner and Habeler stepped to the top of the Himalayas and conveyed that it was possible
 uske baad bhi oxigen kii bottle ke bagaiyr 10 yaa 100 nahin balki 200 se zyada safal abhiyaan hue
 Yet with the aid of Sherpas and the convenience of bottled oxygen, which many do not consider legitimate, the trend of reaching the summit justified the notion of 'discovery' of the colonial style of the 1900s
 uttari or dakshini dhruvon tak sabase pehle pahunchane main vifal hone ke baad britain ne everest, 'tisare dhruv' par sabase pehali jeet darj karaane ke liye sabhi avasaron ko apni mutthi main baandh liya
 In early attempts, intrepid climbers like George Malleri reached altitudes of over 8,000 meters without bottled oxygen
 1924 main kuch prayaason ke baad or asafal hone kii sambhaavna ke dar se melories or irvin ne bottleband hawa kaa istemaal karne kaa faisla kiya jise tibeti or nepali sherpaon ne 'angreji hawa' kaa naam diya
 Not surprisingly, the language associated with climbing Everest is also ornate and bizarre
 ye parvatarohi kehalaate hai or himalay par chadhaai ('climb) nahin karte, balki use napate (scale) hai
 No matter how much they have used, no matter how nervous they are, on safe return, they declare victory over the Himalayas in front of the world, not to climb them and return
 1953 main shikhar se lautne par abhiyaan ke bare main jorge lov ko bataate hue sar edmund hillari ne kaha tha, ''wel jorge, ve nocked da bastard of
 
 '' us sainya tareeke ke abhiyaan main kareeb 362 kuliyon kii toli saath gai thi
 Although some Western climbers may regret the loss of Everest's world, its grandeur and pride, it is ironically that they started this tradition
 jo bhi ho, aaj bhi hamaari kalpana kii udaan shandaar safaltaaon yaa melories or andrew irvin, peter bordman or jo tasker jaise logon ke naakaam lekin saahsee abhiyaanon kii door thaamne ke bajaae everest kii sabase anokhi duniya ko khangaalane kii ore aakarshith hoti he

 samaaroh ke baad bant singh jhabbar ne navdeep ko bhi sadsyta die jane ke bare main kaha ki unhone yah nahin sochaa tha ki aisa din bhi dekhnaa pad saktaa he
 On this, Sanjay Singh said that the matter is not known, and assured to investigate

 Before Surendra Singh, Union Minister Giriraj Singh had said that if Ram temple will not be built in Ayodhya, will Pakistan and Mecca be built in Madina? In a conversation with the media in Begusarai, Union Minister Giriraj on Thursday said that the BJP never said that a Ram temple will not be built
 dharm ke aadhaar par saal 1947 main desh kaa bantwaaraa hua tha
 In such a situation, there is anger among the people of Sanatan Dharma

 The Cabinet has given its consent to this
 Currently Minister of Urban Development, Kamalnath is a Congress veteran who has held important many positions in the party and the Government
 Elected from Chhindwara constituency of Madhya Pradesh Kamalnath has never lost a Lok Sabha election since he was first elected in 1980
 He takes keen interest in the development of tribals and has strong views on economic and environmantal issues
 It was first said by UR Ananthamurthy that if Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, he would leave the country
 iske baad yuar ananthamurti kii bahut aalochana hui
 It was also said that why they are talking about leaving the country
 baad main ananthamurti ne mana ki unka vaktavy kinchit bhavukta main diya gaya tha or desh chhodane kii koi baat nahin he
 But after this, there was a spurt of literal attacks on him
 unako bhi pakistan jane kii salaah di gai
 It is said that after the victory of Modi in 2014, an eminent organization called Namo Brigade also announced to buy tickets for Pakistan
 sirf ittifaaq maananaa chahie ki narendra modi ke pradhanmantritv ke chand maheene baad usee saal ananthamurti duniya chhodkar chal die
 However, it is quite possible that the attacks on him in the last days of his life have also been subjected to mental pressure, which was paid for by his body
 to jane-anjaane hamane apane ek bade lekhak ko sampradayik hamale main kho diya
 But perhaps it was good for them
 nahin to ve aaj kuch adhik maayusi ke saath dekh rahe hote ki lekhakon-kalakaaron or apane samay ke bauddhikon kii vaid chintaaon kaa yah samaaj kis ugrata se pratyuttar dene laga he
 The India in which he became a major writer, questioning the inertia being imposed in the name of the Ananthamurthy tradition and advocating linguistic-cultural plurality, is slowly bent on dismissing every question, viewing every concern as a conspiracy Is becoming accustomed to yah samaaj main kavita, kala or karunaa kii ghatati hui jagah kaa bhi nateeja he
 After Ananthamurthy, it was said by Aamir Khan that he is scared to see the changing environment of the country
 lekin aamir khan ne bas itnaa hi nahin kaha tha
 He expressed his apprehension about the changing environment, expressing deep trust in India's plurality and tolerance
 jis kaarykram main aamir ne yah kaha, usamen kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali bhi maujuud the
 But he cunningly said that one should understand the atmosphere and talk
 aamir ke baad desh ke uparashtrapati rahe hamid ansaari ko bhi logon ne nahin bakhsha
 Repeated attempts were made to prove their different behavior as anti-national
 ve sari koshishen niraadhaar nikaleen
 Later, when Hamid Ansari pointed out this growing intolerance in a very gentle tone, attacks on him also started
 nasiruddin shah kaa bayaan lekin in donon se alag he
 Naseer is not afraid
 unhen gussa aata he
 They have clearly said that they are not going to leave the country
 jaahir he, ve is desh ko apana maanate hai
 But are we slowly creating a country within a country that does not consider Nasir to be its own? This suspicion is because no one felt the need to listen to them patiently
 nafrat or kattarta kii khaad par paley shivasena jaise sanghathan tak unako sikh dene lage ki unhen apane bacchon ko hindustani bananaa chahie
 While Naseer said that he is making his children Hindustani, what will he answer tomorrow when he is asked his religion
 naseer ko jaise yaad dilaa diya gaya ki ve musalmaan hai or unako apana dar yaa gussa jo bhi ho, rakhane kaa haq nahin he
 If they keep, they will keep it like someone's agent
 maamla yaheen tak simit nahin rahaa
 Then Naseer's critics started remembering all the old names and then the advice to go to Pakistan started to be repeated
 ananthamurti ne desh chhodane kii baat kahi thi, pakistan jane kii nahin
 Many people leave the country - they study here and go to big jobs in other countries - say that there are no opportunities for them in India
 unke bich modi bhaashan karke aate hai
 But in the context of Ananthamurthy, why did leaving the country mean moving to Pakistan? Even then Ananthamurthy was an ideological enemy, not alien
 lekin naseer jaise log to vaaki ve log hai jinke liye pakistan banaaya gaya tha- yah dharna jaise haal ke varshon main itani baddhamul hoti chali gai he ki ham apni bhartiyata ko, apni rashtriyata ko, apane rashtriya charitra ko bilkul pakistan ke sandarbh main paribhaashit karne lage hai
 Rather, India is becoming more like Pakistan from this context of Pakistan, the evidence is increasing
 pichley kuch varshon main har sarkaar virdohi vyakti yaa vichaar ko deshadrohi bataane main lagi vichaardhaara lagbhag barbar dhang se alpsankhyakon ke daman kaa utsav manaati nazar aati he- jo utsav nahin manaate, ve bhi use sahi tehraane kii daleelein khojate dikhaai padate hai
 Raising funds for Shambhunath Rager, who shot Afraazul in Rajasthan and made videos of him, providing free counsel to those caught for the violence in Bulandshahr and garlanding those accused of cow protection is increasing
 is prasang main daraane vaali baat ek or he
 Among the writers and journalists whom we have considered as serious writers and journalists, many of them are trying to describe Nasiruddin Shah as untrustworthy, if not alien
 ve bas itnaa sayaanaapan dikhaa rahe hai ki naseer ko sidhe-sidhe pakistan bhejne kii vakaalat kiye bina unhen chunavi raajnneeti ke mohare kii tarah pesh kar rahe hai-jaise naseer nejaan-boojh kar chunaav se pehle yah vaktavy diya ho
 Some people in responsible positions are linking them to the 'award Return Gang'
 kehane kii zarurat nahin ki yah ‘puraskaar vaapasi gang' shabd bhi isi vichaardhaara kaa gadha hua he jo lekhakon se unki vishwasaneeyata chhinane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Journalists and intellectuals who use it are actually suspicious of their intellectual autonomy, their right to resist, and even the very personal action of returning their prize
 samajhane kii zarurat yah he ki aaj inke nishane par naseer hai, kal baaki log honge
 Just as the market sees only profits, not caste and creed, similarly power driven bigotry sees only power, not religion
 use apane maqasad main aade aane ke liye subodh kumaar ko bhi maarane main hichak nahin hoti
 She may also question a brave officer like Hemant Karkare who eventually had to prove her patriotism by committing her life to a terrorist attack in Mumbai
 aaj ve aamir, hamid ansaari or naseer ke kilaaf hai kyonki inhone unki ashishnutaa kii ore ishaara bhar kiya he, kal inke banaae taur-tareeqon kaa aap virodh karenge to ye aapke kilaaf bhi honge, aapke ghar bhi pathar phenke jaaenge
 They will eventually be against being considered freely - they would like you to learn their own language, speak and teach their generations - a language of hatred and mistrust that eventually makes the country smaller
 pakistan or afghanistan ke anubhav is maamle main hamaare bahut kaam aa sakate hai
 But those who are bent on making India like Pakistan, why should they care about it
 rajdhani menclingke maamle par dilhibijepdhyakshamanoj tiwarishuukravaar ko ek baar phirasupreme courtmen pesh hae
 Stepping out of the court, Manoj Tiwari said that today the Supreme Court has again given the next date of hearing

 Taking a dig at the monitoring committee, Tiwari said that the sealing industry is going on in Delhi

 On receiving the next date from the Supreme Court, Tiwari expressed surprise, it is beyond my understanding why the next date is being met again and again
 Tiwari said that today a 75 year old woman came home crying that my house was sealed
 gokulpurcling masalaper tiwari ne doharaaya ki mujhapar contempt kaa cese banataa hi nahin he, isliye maafee kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Manoj Tiwari said that people in Delhi are living under stress
 avaidh nirmaan vaale doshi logon ko sajaa dijie lekin janata ko pareshaan mat kiijie
 Manoj Tiwari demanded from the Supreme Court that sealing in Delhi should be stopped until the court gives its verdict in the next hearing

 Along with his four children and wife, he has been spending nights under the open sky for many days
 dilip kaa kahana he ki makaan khaali karne ke liye uske pita ne sahmati di he jabaki unka parivaar pita se alag rahata he
 In such a situation, breaking their house is not right
 is colony main kai saalon se rah rahe kareeb 3000 logon main se ab tak kareeb 300 log hi transit camp main shift hue hai
 People allege that the Delhi Development Authority is giving this about 5 acres of land to Raheja Builder to build residential buildings, but the government is ravaging it without a concrete plan to settle them
 tippaniyan Social worker Amit Singh says that a family has many houses here, but there the government is giving only one room to a family

 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne is bajet ko apane blog par 'disconected or niraashajanak' qaraar diya he
 Modi wrote on his blog, '2013-14 General Budget once again shows the failure of the UPA Government
 ye bajet dikhaata he ki vartmaan sarkaar kaise aam janata se puri tarah se disconected he
 The UPA government put the entire nation at stake to make this budget democratic
 haalanki wo isamen safal nahin ho paae kyonki aam janata ko maaloom he ki unhen kya chahie
 Modi wrote Chidambaram's budget, and wrote, "this budget has neither talked about improving the country's growth rate nor does there seem to be any merit between the 12th Five Year Plan
" rajkoshiya ghaataa sudhaarney ke liye bhi is bajet main koi vaada nahin kiya gaya he
 Modi further wrote that in the last budget, it was promised that any bottleneck in the path of development will be removed, but nothing was done in this budget as well
 modi ke mutabik skill development or yuva bharat ke yuvaaon ke liye naukari ko lekar bhi is bajet main kuch nahin kiya gaya he
 This was the last budget of the UPA government
 is bajet ke jariye logon ke liye kuch acha karne kaa mauka bhi upie sarkaar ne ganvaa diya
 According to Modi, the UPA budget is indifferent
 aaj deshvasi bahut hi mushkil mode par khadey hai, jahaan deshavaasiyon ke man main naukari, vikaas, rajkoshiya ghaataa, inphrastracchar main investment kai tarah kii mushkile hai

 The manner in which the Pakistani boat blew itself up after the Indian Coast Guard struck the ground near Porbandar in Gujarat, it seems that the terrorists are once again looking for a 26 / 11 attack on Mumbai or any other city
 But, due to the vigilance and vigilance of Indian security agencies, their nefarious actions could not succeed
 yahaan yah bataanaa bhi zaruri he ki ye fidaayin hamalavar the, jinhen aam bolchaal main aatmghaatee hamalavar kaha jaataa he, kyonki yahi ve aatanki hote hai, jo suraksha agenciyon kii pakad se bachane ke liye khud kii jaan kii parvaah nahin karte
 NTRO, ie the National Technical Research Organization, intercepted a confidential message, "expensive goods have to be sent to India
 
 
 jo saamaan lenge, unhen paisa diya ja chukaa he, or ve taiyaar hai
 
 
 "the second such message was also received on December 31 at 12 noon
 is input ko marine or costguard ko bhej diya gaya
 At the same time, it was found that the Pakistani boat, which came out of the Keti port of Karachi, has entered 10 to 15 kilometers in the Indian border via the international border
 tab costguard ke ship uskaa peechha karne lage or uski gheraabandi shuru kar di gai
 At that time, the Pak Boat was silently turning off the light and heading towards India in the dark
 costguard ne unako roka or boat kii lits jalaane or boat kii talaashi dene ke liye kaha
 At this, the Pakistani boat rapidly tried to flee back to Karachi
 kareeb ek ghanta peechha karne ke baad costguard ship pakistani boat ko roak paane main safal ho gaye
 Here the surveillance ship Dornier was also keeping an eye on the boat
 boat par kareeb chaar log dekhe gaye, jinhone costguard kii chetavanee ko nazarandaaj kiya
 Instead of coming up on the deck, all four went inside the deck
 andar jane ke baad unhone apane aapako boat sahit uda liya
 Ship of Coastguard tried hard to save, but nothing could be saved due to darkness and bad weather
 kaha yah ja rahaa ki pakistani boat main badi taadaad main hathiyaar or visphotak the, jinhen unhen duusari boat main transfar karnaa tha
 Security agencies were already receiving such inputs that terrorists might again enter India by sea
 varsh 2008 main aise hi pakistani aatanki karachi se pehle pakistani boat se bhartiya seemaa main daakhil hue the or phir porbandar ke paas samudr main hi 'kuber' naam kii bhartiya boat ko agava kar mumbai main tabaahi machaane pahunch gaye the
 This time too, again there was an attempt to execute a similar terror plot, which was caught in time
 gauratlab he ki is baar ganatantr diwas par america ke raashtrapati baraak obama mukhya atithi hai, to aise main aatanki ek tir se do nishaanaa saadhane ke firaaq main the
 On the one hand, India would have got the opportunity to inflict more injuries, and on the same side, the terrorists could also make America realize their growing strength

 The Center has told the Supreme Court that there is no question of filing an FIR or conducting a CBI investigation in the fighter aircraft Rafale deal because the Supreme Court has already said that this There is no reason for her to interfere in 'sensitive issues'
 centre sarkaar ne kaha he ki niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (kaig) report ne in ladaaku vimaanon kii kathith 'atyadhik keemat' ke bare main yachikakartaon kii mukhya daleelon ko jhootha sabit kar diya he
 Significantly, the Central Government has sought to dismiss the Supreme Court's plea to reconsider the decision of December 14 last year, in which the government was asked to purchase 36 fighter jets from the French company Dassault
 Clin chit was given
 supreme court main daakhil 39 prishthon kii apni likhit daleel main centre sarkaar ne kaha he ki yachikakartaon or purv kendriya mantri yashavanth sinha (yashwant Sinha), arun shouri (arun Shourie) tathaa adhivaktaa prashanth bhushan (prashant Bhushan) ne aisa koi thos aadhaar nahin pesh kiya jo 14 disambar ke faisle par punarvichaar ko nyyochit tehra sake
 The central government said that especially when this court came to the conclusion that on all three aspects, which are the decision making process, pricing and Indian offset partner, the court on the sensitive issue of purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets by the Government of India There is no reason to interfere
 saath hi koi exiaar darj karne yaa sibiai se jaanch karaane kaa koi sawaal hi nahin he
 On May 10, a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi reserved its judgment on the petitions to reconsider the December 14 verdict in the Rafale case
 sinha, shouri or bhushan ke alaava aam aadmi party (AAP) ke rajyasabha sadsy sanjay singh or adhivaktaa vineet dhandha ne bhi punarvichaar yachikaayen daayar kii hai
 In its written plea, the central government said, "based on the demand to reconsider the decision and relying on some media reports and some incomplete internal file noting, the petitioners cannot demand reopening of the entire subject, because the reconsideration The scope of the petition is highly limited
 ' daleel main kaha gaya he ki file noting kii ye pratiyaan anadhikrut rup se or avaidh tareeke se hasil kii gai thi
 The Center also said that the petitioners have not provided any new evidence in the reconsideration petition, except that they have now made their case on some documents whose copies were unauthorized from the confidential files of the Ministry of Defense
 centre sarkaar ne kaha ki kaig ko file or dastavej uplabdh karaae gaye or iskaa adhyayan karne tathaa apni report ko antim rup dene main kareeb do saal laga
 Also, the CAG report does not support the plea of the petitioners that the price of the aircraft is higher than the AMRC bid
 pariyojna kaa kriyanvayan apane tay kaarykram se ho rahaa he or donon deshon kii sarkarein isaki kareebi nigaraanee kar rahi he
 The government also said that the government had no role in the selection of an Indian offset partner
 centre sarkaar ne kaha ki is saude kii prakriya kii pradhanmantri karyaalay dwaara nigaraanee ko hastkshep yaa samanaantar baatcheet ke rup main nahin dekha saktaa
 The government said that training of Indian Air Force personnel is continuing in France
 is kharid ko baadhit karne kii koi bhi koshish pariyojna ko kriyanvit karne main der kar sakati he or isse vayusena kii sanchaalan taiyaariyaan prabhavit hongi
 It is noteworthy that Sinha, Shourie and Bhushan had alleged in the Supreme Court that the Center has deliberately misled the Supreme Court in the purchase of Rafale planes and this is a big fraud

 Film Name: Gabbar Is backdirector: Krishstar Cast: Akshay Kumar, Shruti Haasan, Sunil Grover, Jaideep Ahlawat, Suman Talwar Duration: 131 minscertify: u / a Rating: 2 starhindi Movies: The remake trend is in full swing, ever with Hollywood inspiration
 a remake of films made in South India
 pichley dinon wanted or roudi rathore jaisi hit rimek ke saath saath kai asafal hindi rimek filmein bhi parade par ain
 Another such Tamil film Ramanna (released in 2002, director AR Murgadoss's film), after the Telugu and Kannada remakes, is now made into a Hindi remake of the same film as 'gabbar Is Back'
 baaki bhashaaon main to film super hit thi lekin kya ise hindi main safalataa milegi?aaiye pataa karte hai, sabase pehle kahani-gabbar (akshay kumaar) samaaj ke muddon ko khatm karne kaa jimmaa uthaate hai, sabase bada mudda he bhrashtachar jiske liye aam aadmi ke rup main ek team kaa gathan karte hue gabbar kabhi tehsildaaron ko sabak sikhaata he to kabhi hospital kii lut kii kahani ko sabake saamne laata he or ant main apane ateet main hui ghatnaon kaa khaatmaa karte hue sabko sikh detaa he
 He also encounters CBI chief (jaideep Ahlawat), industrialist Patil (suman Talwar), Sadhu (sunil Grover) and Shruti (shruti Haasan) as a lawyer throughout the development
 akshay kumaar kii maujuudagi film main ection kii purti karti he, lekin aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo aapako akshay kii taraf se nayaa mil rahaa ho, ek aam aadmi ke kirdaar ko nibhaate hue akshay kumaar puri tarah se superhiro kii tarah kabhi bhi or kisi ko bhi sabak sikhaane main sakasham rahete hai
 After Rowdy Rathore, there was speculation that through this film too many dialogues would be heard and remembered, but not a single dialogue is of the level that you can remember
 kahani kaaphi saral thi lekin nirdeshak krish ke prayogon kaa khamiyaja puri film ko uthaanaa pad saktaa he, kaaphi halke screenple kii vajah se shruti kaa kirdaar kab aata he kab chalaa jaataa he is baat kaa kisi ko ilm nahin ho paata
 If we talk about the villain of the film, even a South superstar like Suman Talwar does not give this film the speed that a good negative character should do
 uske samvaad main bhi kuch khalipan sa najar aata he
 Kareena Kapoor Khan's presence of a few moments was also just one song and i think the director should have taken some more time to establish Akshay Kumar's character as a leader
 is film main sirf sunil grover kaa hi kirdaar aisa he jiske prati aapaki sahanubhuti thodi zyada rahati he, shuru se lekar aakhir tak sunil kaa trek sabase behatar he
 The music of the film has also been used in a very wrong way, whenever you are serious about the issue, the song is blocked due to the song at the same time, due to which the anxiety starts to increase when the film will move and that is not it
 In this film you will also get a glimpse of the delivery system shown by '3 Idiots' by Raju Hirani
 film kaa ek hospital kaa seen kaaphi sahi filmaaya gaya he jo ki hospital prashasan kii kalai kholane main kisi had tak kaamyaab ho saktaa he or akshay ke dwaara kuch baaten bataai gai hai jo ki chaatro ke liye jaruratmand ho sakati hai, jaise ki 5 chijen kaaphi aavashyak hai- 'khinchaav, dabaav, tod, mode or ghumaav' lekin ek leadership kii bhaavana kahin na kahin paripurna nahin ho paayi he
 Seeing the trailer, it seemed that there would be applause throughout the dialogues, but during the film there was no moment when the clap should be played loudly
 film kaa clymex to aapako boriyat kii simaaon ke upar le jaataa he or ek hi sawaal man main aata he ' ye film kab khatm hogi?'to is hafte agar aap abhinayta akshay kumaar ke bahut hi bade fain yaa prashansak hai yaa phir sunil grover or shruti hasan ke kaayal hai, to hi ye film dekhen anyathaa unheen paison se manoranjan kaa koi or saadhan dhund sakate hai
