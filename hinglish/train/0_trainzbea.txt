 There is a lot of uproar in the countries of South Asia about Rohingya Muslims
 bharat main bhi is samudaay ko lekar sarkaar kii raay spasht nahin he

 haalanki, court se sarkaar ne ise hold karne kii apil kii he
 The Modi government is shying away from giving Rohingya Muslims a place in India, saying that this would threaten India's internal security
 lekin kya 40 hajaar rohingya bharat ke liye vaaki khatra he yaa phir iske peeche koi raajnneetik kaaran he
 If we look at India's past, India has always opened doors for refugees
 ab tak tibeti, bangladesh ke chakma-hajong, afgani or srilanka ke tamilon ko bharat main sharan mili he
 Out of these, the Supreme Court has even ordered the people of Chakma and Hajong community to grant Indian citizenship

 china bhi rohingyaon ko sharan dene se manaa kar chukaa he
 In such a situation, if India gives them asylum, then it will have an impact on the Indian policy of reducing Chinese dominance
 kashmir ke liye khatra
 
 
 After migrating from Myanmar, many Rohingyas have also settled in Jammu and Kashmir
 bharat dhai dashak se kashmir main aatankwaad se jujh rahaa he

 a senior UGC official said that the Women's Studies Centers were marginalized in the society and special attention would be paid to the disadvantaged women
 isamen essi-asti, divyang mahilaayein, asurakshit maahaul main rah raheen mahilaon samet kai mahilaon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 The official says that a Women's Studies Center should follow a broad, critical and balanced understanding of India's socio-economic realities and governance

 For the last 2 months, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has been on a developmental review tour in Bihar and is continuously attacking RJD leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav on this journey
 khaskar jis tareeke se baxur ke nandan gaanv main nitish kumaar ke upar hamalaa hua uske baad se tejasvi ke tevar or aakraamak ho gaye hai or unhone kaha he ki mukhyamantri ko vikaas samiksha yatra par nahin balki pashchaatap yatra par nikalnaa chahie tha
 Tejashwi has also responded to the same harsh attitude and said that 86 deaths occurred in police custody in Bihar during the lalu-rabri regime of 1990-2005
 party pravaktaa sanjay singh ne twit karte hue kaha ki yah maut ke aankade rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog ke hai or tejasvi ko jawaab dena chahie kiin 86 mauton kaa jimmedaarakhir kise mana jayega?jediu ne kaha ki lalu-rabari ke shasankaal main narsanhaar aam baat ho gai thi or us dauraan bihar ko hatya, lut, dakaiti, chori or apharan ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Sanjay Singh said that Tejashwi Yadav will never be able to free himself from this sin and in such a situation, Tejashwi Yadav should tell who will atone for the sins committed during Lalu's rule
 The family of Tejashwi Yadav has always protected the corrupt officials and it is only on the strength of these corrupt officials that the Lalu family plundered the treasury
 Tti is created
 jediu ne kaha ki ek taraf bihar kii garib janata he or vahiin duusari taraf tejasvi saamaajik nyaay kaa chola pahan kar gum rahe hai
 Sanjay Singh said that the Lalu family is the same Bahupriya family who acquired power in the name of the poor but never did anything for the poor
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki lalu parivaar ne hameshaa bihar kii garib janata kaa khun chusaa he, garibon kii jameen hadpi he, garibon ko naukari ke naam par lutaa he, garibon ko netaa banane ke naam par lutaa he or har tareeke se garib ko or garib hi banaaya he
 Rahul Gandhi will be crowned as Congress President in the last week of October, but before that the color, form and tone of the party seems to be changing
 isaki shuruyaat rahul gandhi ne america se kii or uske baad sidhe modi ke garh gujarat kii jameen par utarkar bijepi ko baikfoot par laa diya he
 Let us know that after the defeat of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress was seen on the ventilator
 rahul gandhi ne apni tajposhi se pehle congress ke mekaover kaa plan banaaya or use amal main bhi laae
 The effect of Rahul's strategy is seen that the Congress party has surrounded the Modi government on many issues
 soshal media se lekar jameen tak congress party or kaaryakarta sakriy najar aa rahe hai
 Conflict on the ground: Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is in a new mood after coming back from America and himself is struggling on the ground
 pichley ek maheene main rahul do baar gujarat kii jameen par utarkar gujarat kii bijepi sarkaar se lekar centre kii modi sarkaar ko kathghare main khadaa kiya
 Meet the Patidar community, considered the kingmakers of Rahul, meet the farmers, interact with the students, visit the temple
 itnaa hi nahin rahul ne adivaasiyon or obisi samudaay se bhi sidhe sampark kiya
 Rahul is giving clear signals to the party leaders who have been doing politics sitting in the AC room till now

 This new army of spokespersons will be an important part of the Congress party

 The Congress Media Department will continue to follow the leaks of its old mantra 'think Global, Act Local' i
e
 the regional leaders of Congress will be seen debating and discussing before the media on various issues related to their state
 ab congress apane mutthi bhar pravaktaaon par nirbhar rahane kii bajaay yuva pratibhaaon ko aage laaegi, jo bijepi ko kadi takkar denge
 The Congress State Communications Department has started sending the list in this regard to the All India Congress Committee

 This is the reason why Rahul Gandhi has raised these issues to surround the Modi government from America to Gujarat and Amethi
 maujuuda samay main desh main lagaataar berogari badhati ja rahi he, kisaan badahaal or garibi se jujh rahe hai
 Apart from this, the gap between rich and poverty in the country is widening
 modi sarkaar dwaara notebandi or GST se chote kaarobaariyon kii qamar tut chuki he
 In such a situation, Rahul has surrounded the Modi government by raising these issues
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ke andar se bhi in muddon ko lekar aawaaj uth rahi he
 Many Sangh related organizations are also not happy about Modi's economic policies
 modi ke hathiyaar se modi ko gheraanarendra modi ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jeet kaa mukhya hathiyaar soshal media rahaa he
 Whereas in 2009, there was only one Congress leader, Shashi Tharoor, who had a Twitter account

 Rahul Gandhi has also been active on Twitter recently after Divya took over
 unke saath-saath kai congress netaa bhi soshal media par aae hai
 Raahul Gandhi of soft Hindutva is also trying to respond to allegations of 'anti-hindu' and 'appeasement of minorities' by the BJP against the Congress party
 darasal 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main congress kii haar kii ek badi vajah antni cameti ne hindu virdohi chhavi maani thi
 Rahul has started an exercise to break the anti-hindu image of the Congress through the Gujarat Assembly elections and is seen playing the card of soft Hindutva
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi had recently visited the Saurashtra region of Gujarat for three days
 is dauraan rahul gandhi gujarat ke paanch mandiron main gaye or rajkot tathaa jamnagar main garba main shaamil hue
 Rahul started his journey by worshiping Lord Krishna at the Dwarkadhish temple on 25 September

 Even Rahul had climbed a thousand stairs in 15 minutes without stopping for darshan of Goddess Chamunda situated on the hill
 madhya gujarat ke daure par bhi rahul ne kai mandiron kaa darshan kiya he
 In the midst of the Test series against South Africa, Sachin Tendulkar had resigned as captain and surprised the board officials but only after the intervention of his wife Anjali decided to remain captain
 bisisiai ke purv sachiv je vaai lele ne apni kitaab ‘ai vaaj der- memoyrs aaf e cricket administrator’ main likhaa ki tendulkar captain ke rup main apane asafal kaarykaal se itane niraash the ho gayi the ki ve istife ke liye 1999-2000 dakshin africa shrinkhalaa ke khatm hone kaa bhi intjaar nahin kar sake
 Lele wrote, 'in 1999–2000 there was a two-test series against South Africa in India
 pehla test mumbai main dakshin africa ne aasaani se teen din main jeet liya tha
 The Indian team was getting criticized all around, especially captaining Sachin
 vah kaaphi niraash or nervas tha
 At the end of the second day, it was clear that India would lose the match by a big margin
 ’unhone likhaa, ‘shaam ko sachin ne mujhe ek patr saunpa
 i was surprised because it was his resignation from his captaincy
 main bhuchakka rah gaya
 The first match of the series was about to end and the second and final match was scheduled to begin in Bangalore
 yahaan tak agar vah apamaanit yaa doshi mahasoos kar rahaa tha to use test shrinkhalaa ke khatm hone kaa intjaar karnaa chahie tha or tab istipha dena chahie tha
 'lele wrote,' i tried to convince him (tendulkar) but he seemed mentally exhausted and wanted to resign
 yah kaaphi mushkil sthiti thi
 Lele said that he then sought intervention from BCCI chief Raj Singh Dungarpur and former all-rounder Ravi Shastri but they too failed after which he spoke to Tendulkar's wife Anjali after which he agreed
 unhone likhaa, ‘ant main ravi or maine sachin kii patni da
 Talked to Anjali
 maine suzav diya ki agar vah team kaa netritv nahin karnaa chaahate to vah test shrinkhalaa ke ant main aisa kar sakate hai jiske liye unki prashansa kii jaayegi
 Thank God, i do not know who did this but Sachin captained against his will in the second Test
 ’unhone kaha, ‘durbhaagya se bharat doosraa test bhi ganvaa baitha or chayan samit ne saurav ganguli ko vanade shrinkhalaa ke liye captain chunaa or phir test maichon main bhi unhen captaini saunp di
 'sachin Tendulkar may be at the top of the cricket record but his record as a captain is not impressive
 Lele feels it happened because this master batsman then paid very heed to the advice of a lot of people
 aise cricketer ke liye jisaki aadat ek ke baad ek ricard todane kii he, vah ab 100 antarrashtriya shatak ke kareeb he
 But Tendulkar's captaincy record is not so good
 lele ne likhaa ki tendulkar anekon kii salahon par dhyaan diya karte the or samajhate the ki bado kii baat nahin sunanaa asabhyataa he
 Lele wrote, 'sachin could not prove himself a successful captain, although he is great as a player
 mujhe unki shandaar ballebaaji ke bare main likhane kii jarurat nahin he kyonki yah jag jaahir tathy he or unke cricket kaushal ke bare main kai baar likhaa ja chukaa he
 i was crying when i saw him resigning as captain
 ’lele ne likhaa, ‘main khud ko bhaagyashaalee samajhataa hum ki jab tendulkar captain the, mujhe unke saath baatcheet ke kaaphi maukey mili
 His biggest problem was that he used to listen to a lot of people
 sachin ne 16 varsh kii umr se antarrashtriya cricket khelnaa shuru kar diya tha or iske baad se bado kaa aadar karnaa unki aadat ban gayi thi
 He felt that it is his duty to apply what the big people are saying
 aisa karte hue usne apni samaj nahin lagaayi
 In some cases it proved beneficial for them and in others it did not
 ’lele ne yah bhi kaha ki tendulkar ne ek maamle main kisi kii sifarish suni or yah jane bina ek aise khilaadi kaa samarthan kiya ki use uski ranjai trophy team se baahar kiya ja chukaa he
 He wrote, 'after the Kanpur Test match in the series against South Africa, the selection committee met in Ahmedabad to select the team for the next match
 adhyaksh kishan ruungta the jo behtareen chayakankarta the
 'lele wrote,' In this meeting, Sachin said that Mumbai's Nilesh Kulkarni is a very good bowler as he took 26 wickets last season and should get a place in the team
 ruungta ne unase poocha, ‘ye wicket usne koun se toornament main liye? kya aapane use gendbaaji karte hue dekha he?’ lele ne likhaa, ‘sachin achakachaa gayi
 Though he is a Mumbai player himself, he has rarely played a Ranji Trophy match for Mumbai due to the busy schedule of international events and he does not even see domestic cricket
 unhone kaha, ‘nahin sar, lekin main jaanata hum ki usne 26 wicket chatkaye hai or vah bahut acha he’ After the film 'der', there were differences between Sunny Deol and Shahrukh, after which the two never came together in any film
 haal hi main sani deol ne ek intervyuu main is bare main baat karte hue kaha bhi tha ki nirdeshak yash chopra ne 'dar' kii kahani spasht na sunaakar unase kaam karavaaya or film main villen hote hue bhi shahrukh hero ban gaye
 Since then, Sunny and Shah Rukh had nothing in common

 However, this thing is outdated, because the new news is that Sunny and Shah Rukh will be together on screen at the same time as the trailer of Sunny's film 'ghayal Once Again' is being put up
 shahrukh khan kii film 'dilavaale' ke saath yani shahrukh kii film main sani kii film kaa trailor

 'dilavaale' ke saath release hone ja rahi ek or badi film 'bajirao mastaani' main bhi 'ghayal vans agen' kaa trailor joda ja rahaa he
 Fans of both can hope that if the relationship between the two stars improves and the script settles down, the fear of seeing the two together after the scare may be over

 uske liye jeetna sambhav bhi nahin he
 She only wants Rahul Gandhi's victory, which is possible
 congress kii jeet kaa matlab bahumat paanaa he
 It is not necessary for Rahul to win
 congress ko 2009 ke sansadeey chunaavon main 90 se zyada vidhansabhai ilaakon main badhat mili thi
 But its success will not be judged by this, but against the 22 seats it won in 2007
 yadi rahul gandhi is baar lagbhag 70 siten jitaane main safal rahe, to unke mahimamandan main koi kasar nahin chodi jaaegi
 After all, it has been her campaign, even with her sister Priyanka Gandhi confined mainly to family constituencies - Rae Bareli and Amethi
 sonia gandhi ne bhi is maamle main prabhaavshaalee lekin simit hastkshep kiya he
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will give his first election speech after half of Uttar Pradesh goes to polls
 congress kaa jor uttar pradesh par isliye zyada he kyonki usase rahul gandhi parivaar kii chunavi saakh ban sakati he
 In this way, Rahul can be in control of the party and the government whenever he wants
 is tarah kaa mauka in garmiyon main raashtrapati pad ke liye hone vaale chunaav se pehle aa saktaa he
 Meanwhile, Dr
 manmohan singh raajnneeti main apane asaadhaaran kariyar ko raashtrapati bhawan tak le jane kii koshish kar sakate hai
 Whatever be the case, Rahul Gandhi will have to decide without waiting for the circumstances
 ve faisla 6 march ke baad karenge
 We know that he will remain in Indian politics
 lekin ham is bare main kuch nahin kah sakate ki unki haisiyat kya hogi
 If Rahul Gandhi is not able to become Prime Minister, then he will be Sonia Gandhi and Dr
 manmohan singh ke saath milakar congress or sarkaar donon ko chalaayenge
 But two people are enough to run the Congress and the government
 isliye tikdi kaa rahanaa mumkin nahin hoga
 Somebody has to withdraw
 aisi sthiti main is baat kaa mahatv nahin rah jaataa ki uttar pradesh main jeet kiski hogi
 The importance of manipulation in Delhi will be important
 sansad main upie ke bahumat ko bhaajapa se chunauti nahin milegi
 The Congress does not consider the BJP to be a competent opposition
 vah uske saath bhagava dianasor jaisaa bartaav karti he jise ab tak vilupt ho janaa chahie tha, lekin vah ab tak kisi tarah bachaa hua he or apni fajihat kara rahaa he
 The biggest concern of the Congress is its allied parties
 ve un rajyon par kabja jamaaye hue hai jinhen congress ko jeetne kii jarurat he
 Only then can she get a majority in the Lok Sabha
 congress apni mitra partiyon ko maat dene ke liye lagaataar koshish kar rahi he
 Mamta Banerjee knows this
 sharad pavaar jaanate hai
 If Mulayam Singh Yadav does not know, then he will also know
 nae rujhaan kaa pataa 16 march ko pesh hone vaale bajet se chal jayega
 The victorious Congress can take such steps that can upset the allies
 masalan, retail main epadi laana yaa videshi niveshkon ko indian airlines ke share kharidne kii ijaajat dena
 a confident Congress may challenge Mamata Banerjee to pull out of the UPA alliance
 duusari taraf, parrast congress yathasthiti banaae rakhane ke liye sangharsh karegi
 Mamta Banerjee will first attack her through public statements and will be with the opposition on some issues
 is tarah, sadan main kisi bhi matdaan main congress kaa bahumat achaanak khatre main pad saktaa he
 a crisis may also arise over the Congress nominee for President
 agar congress ne raashtrapati chunaav ko sahi dhang se sambhaal liya or uskaa ummidavaar jeet jaataa he to sarkaar nahin bhi gir sakati he
 But like an injured boxer, it will remain round to round in such a manner that such a situation ends quickly
 is paridrishy main keval ek shaks dow
 Manmohan Singh will benefit
 unke kad se kam-se-kam thode samay ke liye sarkaar surakshit rah sakati he
 a senior diplomat described the ongoing confrontation between Iran, Israel and the US over oil and nuclear as a 'choker', a mixed game of chess and poker

 It is like a flush, in which all the cards have to be opened and the player with the better three leaves wins
 uttar pradesh ke maamle main bhi yah baat sateek baithti he
 The cards are not in the hands of the players, but in the hands of the voters
 ve 6 march kii dopaher tak apane sabhi pattey khol denge
 Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav acquitted an 18-year-old boy in a special court in Delhi
 jis par ek 15 saal kii naaballig ladki ke saath protection of children from sexual offence act(pocso) ke tahat jabaran shaadi, balaatkaar or apharan kaa maamla darj kiya gaya tha
 If a Muslim youth runs away with a minor girl and marries her according to Muslim law, can she be considered a criminal under the Protection of POCSO? Citing this question, a special court in Delhi found last week that there are 'obvious differences' between the provisions of Muslim Personal Law and POCSO

 The judge said that under the POCSO Act the minor girl was not competent enough to consent to marriage, but personal law gives the girl the right to marry at this age
 POCSO or muslim personal lau main matbhedjaj vinod yadav kaa maananaa he ki aise muddon par muslim personal lau or POCSO kanoon, donon ke praavdhaanon ke bich spasht matbhed he
 POCSO considers her a baby girl, who is not yet able to consent to their marriage
 jabaki personal lau spasht rup se us is umr main shaadi karne kaa adhikaar detaa he
 The girl's mother had alleged that the daughter was seduced by extortion, in this case the girl's mother had lodged an FIR against the youth under the POCSO Act
 maa ne police main shikaayat darj karaate hue kaha tha ki ladkaa uski beti ko bahalaakar kar bhaga le gaya tha
 After which the police had registered a case of rape, kidnapping and sexual harassment under the POCSO Act on the boy
 magistrate ke samaksh apana bayaan darj karne ke baad, peedit apane mata-pita ke saath nahin gai
 He was sent to Nirmal Chhaya, a children's home in Delhi
 court ne kaha ki yahaan yuvak ne ladki ke saath kisi bhi tarah kii jabardastee nahin kii he
 The girl went with the boy on her own free will and married him
 aise main is cese main ladke ke khilaaf 'bahalaakar kar bhaga le gaya' jaisaa mukadmaa nahin banataa

 "punjabi's Journey" Today, Punjabi dominates in Bollywood, but it has a long way of its own

 He knocked in the 1980s and his songs appeared on Doordarshan in the upcoming New Year program

 However, it was Mica Singh and Daler Mehndi who topped in Bollywood
 lekin jaise hi punjabi ke saath rap kaa sangam hua, darshakon ne dil kholkar iskaa swaagat kiya

 Therefore said that the fight to change society is long
 11 may se supreme court kii paanch jajon kii bench ne shaayara bano kii yachika par dainik sunwaayee shuru karne kaa faisla kiya he taaki jaldi se faisle par pahunchaa ja sake
 In the past year, Shayra has challenged three divorces, Hallala and polygamy
 isi somvaar yani 9 may ko elahabaad hai court ne kaha ki
 
 
 The constitutional right of Muslim women cannot be violated in the name of personal law
 disambar 2016 main elahabaad hoicourt ne teen talaak ko asanvaidhanik mana tha
 Till date, three divorces are very much discussed, then you will understand that the courts have become active
 2 may 2002 ko bombai hoicourt kii teen sadasyeey aurangabad bench ne dagghu pathan banaam rahim bi dagghu pathan maamle main faisla diya ki muslim danpatiyon ko adaalat main baqayada sabit karnaa hoga ki unke bich talaaq ho chukaa he tathaa isse sambandhit shariat kanoon kii sabhi sharten puri kii gai hai
 Otherwise the court will not consider divorce by any type of oral or written statement
 tippaniyan Sheeba wrote in the headline plus in the year of 2002 itself that this decision is based on the decision of the Assam High Court of 1981
 2002 main samim aara banaam uttarapradesh sarkaar cese main supreme court bhi teen talaaq ko galat tehra chukaa he
 
 
 So you saw that in 1981, 2002, 2017, no law has prevented all courts from calling triple talaq unconstitutional
 2007 se bhartiya muslim mahila andolan bhi muslim mahilaon ke adhikaron ko lekar sangharsh kar rahaa he
 It was also told so that there is no confusion among the audience that our leaders are supporting this fight with the aim of social reform
 agar wo vaaki syrius hote to sansad main ise hataane kaa kanoon le aate
 Now the question is that when the triple talaq is considered unconstitutional in many decisions, why is the hearing going on in the Supreme Court for unconstitutional agreement
 faizan mustafaa ne is masale par tribune, di vir, scrol or indian express main kai lekh likhe hai
 They have some points
 2011 kii janaganana report ke anusaar, muslim mahilaon main talaak 0
 56 percent
 2011 kii janaganana report ke anusaar, hindu mahilaon main talaak or parityakta 0
 76 percent
 yah aankada is bhram ko todta he ki sari muslim auraten teen talaak se trast hai or muslim samaaj main subah-shaam talaak dene ke alaava koi or kaam nahin hota he, lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki teen talaaq kii gunzaaish chhod di jaae
 If the rights of the same Muslim woman are killed by this, then the demand to abolish it is completely just and constitutional
 bhartiya muslim mahila andolan ne muslim personal lau board kii tarah apana court banaaya he
 It is called Sharia Court where many cases are dealt with by mutual interdiction
 is court ke saamne aae 525 talaak ke maamalon main sirf
 
 
 0
 2 pratishat talaak phone se hua he
 0
 6 pratishat talaak email se hua he
 1 divorced SMS
 phir bhi koi email se talaak de saktaa he iske paksh main aap aaj ke bharat main kisi ko nahin samajha sakate
 Such a possibility should be eliminated
 bhartiya muslim mahila andolan ke aankade bataate hai ki zyaadaatar talaak vakil, jaj, maulavee or parivaar ke sadasyon ke bich hote hai
 In 40 percent of the cases, women have also sought divorce
 faizan sahab ne das rajyon se fatwa jari karne vaali sanstha darul iftaa se kuch aankade jamaa kiye hai
 Let me tell you that fatwa is not a decision, but if you are confused about something, then ask for opinion on it
 news channelon main fatwe ko farmaan kii tarah pesh kiya jaataa he jo ki galat he
 Faizan Saheb has stated that on the basis of his study
 
 
 3,40,206 fatwon main sirf 6
 50 percent fatwas were about three divorces
 yani bahut kam maamalon main teen talaak ko lekar raay maangi gai
 33 Darul Qaza figures show that he did not have three divorces
 talaaq tabhi diya gaya jab bich-bachaav se lekar sari prakriya puri hui
 Darul Qaza is a kind of court, on which even the Supreme Court refused to ban
 2002 ke bombai hoicourt kii aurangabad bench ne yahi to kaha tha ki teen talaak yaa talaak ko court main sabit karnaa hoga or uske liye puri prakriya kaa paalan karnaa hoga
 The Muslim Personal Law Board had opposed it then and now the Board has said that triple talaq is not right
 uske pehle aath charan kaa hona anivaary he
 This is a big decision, but will it satisfy the three divorce enders

 jo log teen talaak dete hai wo mazahab kaa mazaaq udaate hai
 Sheeba wrote in the headline plus in the year of 2002 itself that this decision is based on the decision of the Assam High Court of 1981
 2002 main samim aara banaam uttarapradesh sarkaar cese main supreme court bhi teen talaaq ko galat tehra chukaa he
 
 
 So you saw that in 1981, 2002, 2017, no law has prevented all courts from calling triple talaq unconstitutional
 2007 se bhartiya muslim mahila andolan bhi muslim mahilaon ke adhikaron ko lekar sangharsh kar rahaa he
 It was also told so that there is no confusion among the audience that our leaders are supporting this fight with the aim of social reform
 agar wo vaaki syrius hote to sansad main ise hataane kaa kanoon le aate
 Now the question is that when the triple talaq is considered unconstitutional in many decisions, why is the hearing going on in the Supreme Court for unconstitutional agreement
 faizan mustafaa ne is masale par tribune, di vir, scrol or indian express main kai lekh likhe hai
 They have some points
 2011 kii janaganana report ke anusaar, muslim mahilaon main talaak 0
 56 percent
 2011 kii janaganana report ke anusaar, hindu mahilaon main talaak or parityakta 0
 76 percent
 yah aankada is bhram ko todta he ki sari muslim auraten teen talaak se trast hai or muslim samaaj main subah-shaam talaak dene ke alaava koi or kaam nahin hota he, lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki teen talaaq kii gunzaaish chhod di jaae
 If the rights of the same Muslim woman are killed by this, then the demand to abolish it is completely just and constitutional
 bhartiya muslim mahila andolan ne muslim personal lau board kii tarah apana court banaaya he
 It is called Sharia Court where many cases are dealt with by mutual interdiction
 is court ke saamne aae 525 talaak ke maamalon main sirf
 
 
 0
 2 pratishat talaak phone se hua he
 0
 6 pratishat talaak email se hua he
 1 divorced SMS
 phir bhi koi email se talaak de saktaa he iske paksh main aap aaj ke bharat main kisi ko nahin samajha sakate
 Such a possibility should be eliminated
 bhartiya muslim mahila andolan ke aankade bataate hai ki zyaadaatar talaak vakil, jaj, maulavee or parivaar ke sadasyon ke bich hote hai
 In 40 percent of the cases, women have also sought divorce
 faizan sahab ne das rajyon se fatwa jari karne vaali sanstha darul iftaa se kuch aankade jamaa kiye hai
 Let me tell you that fatwa is not a decision, but if you are confused about something, then ask for opinion on it
 news channelon main fatwe ko farmaan kii tarah pesh kiya jaataa he jo ki galat he
 Faizan Saheb has stated that on the basis of his study
 
 
 3,40,206 fatwon main sirf 6
 50 percent fatwas were about three divorces
 yani bahut kam maamalon main teen talaak ko lekar raay maangi gai
 33 Darul Qaza figures show that he did not have three divorces
 talaaq tabhi diya gaya jab bich-bachaav se lekar sari prakriya puri hui
 Darul Qaza is a kind of court, on which even the Supreme Court refused to ban

 jo log teen talaak dete hai wo mazahab kaa mazaaq udaate hai
 Faizan Mustafa has written several articles on this issue in Tribune, The Wire, Scroll and Indian Express
 unke kuch bindu hai
 According to the 2011 census report, divorce among Muslim women is 0
 56 pratishat he
 According to the 2011 census report, divorce and abandonment among Hindu women 0
 76 pratishat he
 This figure breaks the illusion that all Muslim women are plagued by triple talaq and in Muslim society there is no other work to do except a morning and evening divorce, but that does not mean that the possibility of triple talaq is left
 ek hi muslim aurat kaa haq isse maaraa jaataa he to ise samaapt karne kii maang puri tarah jaays he or sanvaidhanik he
 The Indian Muslim Women's Movement has created its own court like the Muslim Personal Law Board
 ise sharia court kehete hai jahaan kai maamle aapasi bich-bachaav se nipataae jate hai
 Only 525 divorce cases have come before this court
 
 
 0
 2 percent of divorces are by phone
 0
 6 percent of divorces are by email
 1 talaak esemes se hua he
 Still someone can divorce by email, you cannot explain this in favor of anyone in today's India
 is tarah kii har sambhaavna ko khatm kar dena chahie
 Statistics from the Indian Muslim Women's Movement show that most divorces are between lawyers, judges, clerics and family members
 balki 40 fisadi maamalon main mahilaon ne bhi talaak kii maang kii he
 Faizan Saheb has collected some data from Darul Ifta, the fatwa issuing body from ten states
 aapako bataa den ki fatwa faisla nahin hota, balki aap kisi chiz ko lekar kanfus hai to us par raay maangate hai
 The fatwa is presented as a firman in news channels, which is wrong
 faizan sahab ne apane adhyayan ke aadhaar par bataaya he ki
 
 
 Only 6 out of 3,40,206 fatwas
 50 pratishat fatwe teen talaak ko lekar the
 That is, in very few cases opinion was sought regarding three divorces
 33 daarul kaza ke aankade bataate hai ki unke yahaan teen talaak nahin diya gaya
 Divorce was granted only when the entire process from mediation to completion was completed
 daarul qaza ek tarah kaa court he, jis par bain lagane se supreme court ne bhi manaa kar diya tha
 The Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court of 2002 had said that three divorces or divorces would have to be proved in court and the entire process would have to be followed
 tab muslim personal lau board ne iskaa virodh kiya tha ab jaakar board ne kaha he ki teen talaak sahi nahin he
 It is mandatory to have the first eight steps
 yah bada faisalaa to he, lekin kya isse teen talaak samaapt karne vaale santusht honge
 This issue has been a spectacle for TV for months
 kai maulanaa teen talaak ke paksh main ajeeb-ajeeb tark de rahe hai, jinhen tivi par na aane vaale kai moulana behad aitaraaz se dekh rahe hai
 Syed Shahabuddin Salafi Firdausi, who runs an educational institution in Maharashtra and runs the Athar Blood Bank, says that the issue is human, not communal
 insaaniyat kahati he ki auraton ke saath ninsaafi islam ke kilaaf he
 People who divorce three make fun of religion
 modi sarkaar jidipi ke base year main badlaav kii taiyaari kar rahijidipi maapne ke base year ko sarkarein samay-samay par badalati rahati haniske pehle paanch saal pehle base year badalakar 2011-12 kiya gaya thasarkaar sakal gharelu utpaada (GDP) ke liye nae aadhaar varsh (base year) laane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 All kinds of discussions have started about this
 modi sarkaar ke liye jidipi main lagaataar kam badhat chintaa kii baat rahi he, aise main uske kisi bhi kadam par aksar vipaksh kaaphi ho-hallaa karne lagata he
 Last year, when the Central Government changed the way of valuation of GDP, there was a lot of criticism
 aaie jaanate hai ki kya hoti he jidipi or kya he base year kaa khel
 The Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MOSPI) is considering making 2017-18 a new base year for GDP
 abhi jidipi kaa base year 2011-12 he
 MOSPI Secretary Praveen Srivastava recently said that MOSPI is working to launch a new series of national accounts
 gauratlab he ki is saal april-june timahi main desh ke sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) kii vruddhi dar ghatakar 5 fisadi rah gai he
 This is the slowest pace of India's growth rate in about 7 years
 ahm baat yah he ki jidipi ke maamle main ham bangladesh or nepal se bhi peeche ho gaye hai
 India's average GDP growth rate in the last five years (2014-15 to 2018-19) 7
 6 fisadi hi rahi he
 What happens GDP is the total monetary or market value of all goods and services produced within a set period of time in a country's range is called Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
 yah kisi desh ke gharelu utpaadan kaa vyapak maapan hota he or isse kisi desh kii arthvyavastha kii sehat pataa chalati he
 It is usually calculated annually, but in India it is judged every three months i
e
 quarterly
 jidipi do tarah kii hoti he nominal jidipi or real jidipi
 Nominal GDP is a raw sum of all figures, but inflationary effects in real GDP are also adjusted
 yani agar kisi vastu ke mulya main 10 rupee kii badhat hui he or mahangaai 4 fisadi he to uske real mulya main badhat 6 fisadi hi maani jaaegi
 The figures released in India are of real GDP
 jidipi kisi desh ke aarthik vikaas kaa sabase bada paimaana he
 If GDP increases, it means that the economy is creating more jobs
 iskaa yah bhi matlab he ki logon kii aarthik samruddhi bad rahi he
 How GDP is calculated: GDP in India is calculated quarter by quarter
 jab jidipi main rashtriya jansankhya se bhaag diya jaataa he to prati vyakti jidipi nikalati he
 Agriculture, industry and service in India are three important parts, on the basis of which GDP is determined
 iske liye desh main jitna bhi vyaktigat upbhog hota he, vyavsaay main jitna nivesh hota he or sarkaar desh ke andar jitne paise kharch karti he in sabko jod diya jaataa he
 Apart from this, the total imports are subtracted from the total exports and thus the figure that comes out is also added to the expenditure incurred above
 yahi desh kii kul jidipi hoti he
 Who decides GDP The responsibility of measuring GDP rests with the Central Statistics Office ie Central Statistics Office under the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation
 yah offis hi puure desh se aankade ikattha karata he or unki calculation kar jidipi kaa aankada jari karata he
 Why the base year keeps changing The base year is fixed to determine GDP
 yani us aadhaar varsh main desh kaa jo kul utpaadan tha, uski tulana main arthvyavastha kaa aakaar kitna badha he yaa gata he, use hi jidipi kii dar maani jaati he
 The government changes the base year from time to time so that data about the country's economy can be kept in sync with the world
 aisa mana jaataa he arthvyavastha ke sahi akalan ke liye har paanch saal par base year badal dena chahie
 In the year 2015, the government changed the base of GDP series from 2004-05 to 2011-12
 kyon hota he vivadpichley saal sarkaar ne jidipi main gananaa ke tareeke main kuch badlaav kar diya tha, jisko lekar vivaad ho gaya tha
 In fact, the government had said that after changing the base year, the GDP figures released in its previous years should also be changed
 sarkaar ne uchit tulana ke liye is aadhaar par back siries jari kiye the, or isaki vajah se vitt varsh 2006 se 2012 ke bich ke jidipi aankadon main katautee kar di gai thi, jabaki ve manmohan singh ke daur ke oonche jidipi vaale saal the
 7 the average GDP growth during the six years (FY 2006 to 2012) of the UPA government
 75 fisadi se ghataakar 6
 82 percent
 isko lekar sarkaar ko vipaksh kii aalochana kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 In its first year 2015, the government also made some significant changes in the way GDP was calculated
 iske pehle tak jidipi ko naapane ke liye krishi, udyog or seva kshetra ko jagah di jaati thi
 Under this, agriculture, fisheries, horticulture and many other sectors were added to the agriculture sector, which increased the production figures in the agricultural sector
 thik isi tarah se utpaadan kshetra main pehle tivi or smartphone se aane vaale paise ko jagah nahin di jaati thi
 These sectors have also been included in the change in 2015
 isko lekar bhi aalochakon ne kaha ki sarkaar kisi bhi tarah se jidipi ke aankade badha- chadhaakar dikhaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Law and order in Uttar Pradesh is getting worse day by day
 yogi sarkaar mahila suraksha ko lekar kitne bhi daawey kar rahi ho, lekin hakeekat kuch or hi he

 Sher Singh Rana, convicted in the murder of former MP Phoolan Devi, has been granted bail by the Delhi High Court by suspending his life imprisonment
 yah jamaanat sashart he or 12 saal, 11 maheene va 15 din ke baad sher singh rana reeha ho rahaa he
 The High Court ordered Rana to be released on a surety of Rs 50,000 and two sureties of Rs 50,000 each
 hoicourt ne kaha ki rihaai ke baad rana jahaan bhi rahegaa, pataa or mobile number trial court or parliament street thane ke esechao ko degaa
 The court said that if he changes the address or mobile number, he will also have to be informed for the same
 saal main do baar disambar or june ke duusare shanivaar ko usko rudki ke SP ko hajiri dene kaa bhi aadesh diya gaya he
 Apart from this, he has also been instructed not to meet Phoolan Devi's family
 hoicourt ne kaha ki sarkaar ne trial court ke faisle ko chunauti di he, lekin vah cese abhi sunwaayee par nahin aayaa he
 This hearing will take time now
 sher singh pehle hi jo sajaa kaat chukaa he, uske aadhaar par uski yachika sweekaar kii jaati he
 But this will not affect the hearing of the appeal case
 8 agast 2014 ko trial court ne sher singh ko doshi qaraar dete hue 14 agast ko use umrakaid kii sajaa sunai thi, jabaki 11 anya ko bari kar diya tha
 The application for suspension of sentence stated on behalf of Sher Singh Rana that the trial court did not trust the police conspiracy theory and acquitted the 11 accused
 tippaniyan Said, the trial court did not even consider the motive of the murder reported to the police
 yahaan tak ki agency ke car se chance print milane or hathiyaar baraamad karne ke daawey ko bhi nahin mana
 The statements given by eyewitnesses are also misleading, his name was told as Pankaj but this name is not his

 On the other hand, it was said on behalf of Delhi Police that Sher Singh's sentence cannot be suspended
 wo farvari 2004 se may 2006 tak do saal jail se faraar rahaa he
 The police had challenged the order of the trial court in the Delhi High Court
 hoicourt ne 50 hajaar rupee ke muchalke or 50-50 hajaar kii do syorti par rana ko reeha karne kaa aadesh diya
 The High Court said that Rana will give the address and mobile number to the trial court and the SHO of Parliament Street police station, wherever he remains after the release
 court ne kaha ki agar vah pataa yaa mobile number badalata he, to use iske liye bhi suchit karnaa hoga
 He has also been ordered to attend the SP of Roorkee twice a year on the second Saturday of December and June
 iske alaava use phulan devi ke parivaar se nahin milane kii bhi hidaayat di gai he
 The High Court said that the government has challenged the trial court's decision, but that case has not yet come up for hearing
 is sunwaayee main abhi vakt lagegaa
 Sher Singh has already accepted his plea on the basis of the sentence already imposed
 lekin isse apil maamle kii sunwaayee par koi asar nahin padegaa
 On 8 August 2014, the trial court convicted Sher Singh on 14 August and sentenced him to life imprisonment, while acquitting 11 others
 sajaa ke nilamban ke liye arji main sher singh rana kii ore se kaha gaya he ki trial court ne police kii sajeesh kii theory par bharosa nahin kiya or 11 aropiyon ko bari kar diya

 Even the agency's claim of getting a chance print from the car and seizing the weapon was not accepted

 Exit polls will be the next big trigger for the stock market, create such a strategy: The Indian stock market witnessed a boom after nine consecutive sessions of decline on Tuesday

 The point to note is that the level from which the market has shown a return is technically very important
 mangalvaar ke satr main bana nichalaa str 100 din ke mowing everej ke paas he
 In such a situation, today's rally is seen as buying in selected stocks at lower levels
 nau din kii giravat kaa kaarannishtha kansaltency ke pramukh rajesh sharma kehete hai, ‘’bazaar main giravat kii kai vajah hai
 These include trade war between the US and China, profit-booking before the election results, weak economic data from the domestic economy
 "apart from this, the forecast of low rainfall and weak results released by companies also did not make the market higher
 Let it last

 Exit Poll Next Important: Avinash Gorakshakar, Head (research), Triggint Direct, says, "exit polls on Sunday are the next important trigger in the stock market
" ’’ isse pehle bazaar main kai tarah ke anumaan lagaae ja rahe hai jisaki vajah se bazaar main utaar-chadhaav dekhne ko mil rahe hai

 After the exit poll, if the hopes of a strong government are strengthened, then there may be a good buying in the market, on the contrary, a new round of selling will begin in the face of a fragmented mandate

 In such a situation, market volatility in the short term cannot be ruled out

 jamiyat ulema-e-hind ne ayodhya cese se rajeev dhawan ko hatayakya ayodhya cese par credit war ke chalate rajeev dhawan hataae gadhyodhya vivaad main muslim paksh kii ore se pesh hone vaale aidwocket rajeev dhawan ko jamiyat ulema-e-hind ne is maamle se hataa diya he
 Rajiv Dhawan has not been named as a lawyer in the review petition filed by Jamiat on Monday
 is baat se rajeev dhawan dukhi hai or unhone apane is dard ko soshal media par likhakar bayaan kiya
 In such a situation, the question is why Rajiv Dhawan, who was fighting on behalf of the Muslim parties on the Ayodhya case without a fee, was finally removed? The important person associated with the Muslim Personal Law Board said that for taking all the credit of the Ayodhya case, Jamiat Ulama- a-hind first filed a review petition
 jabaki, muslim pakshakaron ne 25 or 30 november ko vakil rajeev dhawan se mulaakaat kii thi, is dauraan unhone teen se chaar point par kaam karne ke liye bhi kaha tha, jiske baad 30 november ko dilli ke india international centre main saare pakshakaron ne baithak kar punarvichaar yachika daayar karne ke liye saare point kaa draft tay kiya tha
 Jamiat Ulema's lawyer Ejaz Maqbool and team members were also present at the meeting
 india international centre main 30 november ko muslim pakshakaron ke bich tay hua tha ki agali baithak 3 disambar ko hogi, jisamen tay hoga ki kis taarikh ko yachika daayar kerani he
 It was also decided that the five Muslim parties would file a petition simultaneously by showing the draft of the petition to lawyer Rajiv Dhawan
 iske baad 1 disambar ko jamiyat ulema-e-hind team ke vakil akruti or kurthalen ne yachika ke draft ke sambandh main rajeev dhawan se mulaakaat kii thi
 Despite this, Jamiat ulema-e-hind filed a petition in the Supreme Court on Monday even before the December 3 meeting
 rajeev dhawan ko jamiyat kii yachika daayar karne kii khabar unhen tab lagi, jab unhen ejaj makabool ne phone karke bataaya ki unhen ayodhya cese se hataa diya gaya he
 Interestingly, on December 3, Rajiv Dhawan, Dr
 ke yahaan apana ilaaj karaane gaye the
 Rajiv Dhawan's letter to lawyer Ejaz Maqbool (on Record) representing Jamiat ulema-e-hind makes it clear that he too received the news over phone
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki ejaj makabool ne kaha ki aapako babari cese se hataa diya gaya he
 i accepted it without objecting
 jamiyat ke vakil ejaj makabool ne kaha, 'mudda yah he ki mere client yani ki jamiyat somvaar ko rivyuu pitishan daakhil karnaa chaahate the
 Rajiv Dhawan had to do this work
 vah uplabdh nahin the isliye main pitishan main unka naam nahin de paaya
 At the same time, Jamiat has clarified that Rajiv Dhawan has been removed due to poor health
 jabaki, rajeev dhawan ne kaha he ki yah puri tarah se bakawaas he
 i am a doctor ke yahaan pataa chalaa ki mujhe is cese se hamen hataa diya gaya he
 In fact, Jamiat ulema-e-hind decided to file a review petition on Monday so that his name would come up in the entire case
 is cese se judi jo yachikaayen ab daayar hongi, wo rahengi lekin naam sirf jamiyat ulema-e-hind kaa aayega
 That is why Jamiat petitioned on December 2 instead of December 3 in a hurry
 haalanki muslim personal lau board rajeev dhawan ko apana vakil banane ke bayaan par kaayam he
 Explain that after the Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya, Muslim parties under the leadership of Muslim Personal Law Board met in Lucknow
 isamen punarvichaar yachika daayar karne or masjid ke liye 5 acre jameen lene ke mudde par manthan hua
 The meeting was attended by Maulna Arshad Madni, president of Jamiat ulema-e-hind and important member of Mahmud Madnisheet Muslim Personal Law Board and many Muslim parties associated with Ayodhya
 sutron ne bataaya he ki muslim personal lau kii baithak ke shuruaati daur main moulana arshad madani ayodhya faisle ke khilaaf punarvichaar yachika daayar karne ko lekar kashmakash main the or apni raay nahin bana paa rahe the
 Whereas, Mahmud Madni was against filing a review petition
 haalanki muslim personal lau board kii baithak main bahumat ke saath tay hua ki hamen punarvichaar yachika daayar kerani chahie
 After that the meeting was not even finished yet that Maulana Arshad Madani came out and he said that Jamiat Ulema would file a review petition on the Ayodhya case
 iske baad muslim personal lau board ne press conference karke yachika daayar karne kii baat kahi thi
 At the same time, Jabrayab Jilani had said that five of the seven Muslim parties supported the petition
 jabaki central sunni vakf board or ikbaal ansaari ne pehle spasht kar diya tha ki vah faisle ke khilaaf ab yachika daayar nahin karenge
 They still stand on this point

 Because Kiikadashi fast has a direct effect on both mind and body
 iske alaava ekadshi ke vrath se ashubh sanskaron ko bhi nasht kiya ja saktaa hepapankushaekadshiasina maas ke shukla paksh kiekadshiko kehete hai
 The importance of this Ekadashi itself was told by Lord Krishna to Yudhishthira, the king
 is ekadshi par bhagwaan 'padmanabh' kii puja kii jaati he
 It is due to the sinful elephant being pierced by the virtuous curb of this fast that it is named 'papankusha Ekadashi'

 In this way, worshiping God purifies the mind and the person consists of virtues

 But Papankusha Ekadashi benefits others as well as themselves

 Otherwise, take a Vela sattvic meal - Do not consume rice and heavy food on Ekadashi - worshiping at night has special significance - Do not be angry, speak less and control your behavior desh ko aaj nayaa raashtrapati mil jayega

 Facing severe criticism over unemployment and jobless growth, the central government is claiming that new jobs have been created in the number of crores by giving loans through its flagship program Mudra
 is daawey ko khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ne aage badhaate hue pichley saal laal kile se elaan kiya ki mudra yojana ke jariye 13 karod logon ko karj diya gaya he
 Of these, 40 million people are taking business loans for the first time and this has helped in creating new jobs
 baharhaal, mudra yojana ko baariki se dekhne par kuch duusari hi tasviir saamne aati he
 At present, there is no government nor non-governmental data on employment
 lihaaja, kitne rojgaar paidaa hue hai ye vivaad kaa vishay he kyonki mahaj mudra yojana ke tahat die gaye karj ke aadhaar par rojgaar kii sankhya kaa anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he
 The special thing is that under the Mudra scheme, 40 percent of the provision made for loans to micro and small businesses still remains with the government
 vahiin, kai arthshaastriyon samet purv arabiai governor raghuram rajan mudra yojana main sambhavit enpie ke liye agaah kar chuke hai
 So, know what is the truth about the Mudra scheme
 bhul jaaie nae rojgaar, khud kamai nahin kar paa rahe mudra ke 97 fisadi karjadarmudra: puraani yojana kaa nayaa naam?mudra yojana ko 2015 main launch kiya gaya
 Through this, there was a provision to provide refinance loans up to Rs 10 lakh to units of Gaura-corporate and non-agricultural sector to micro and small industries
 aise karj desh main pehle bhi die jate rahe hai lihaaja mudra yojana mahaj in karjon ko ek saath dekhne kii suvidha dene kaa naam he
 According to the annual report of Mudra Yojana, the paid-up equity share of the scheme as on 31 March 2018 was Rs 1,675 crore
 report ke mutabik 2016-17 main mudra ke liye 80 fisadi funding or 2017-18 main 87 fisadi funding ko priurity sector diposit ke taur par darj kiya gaya
 These loans were earlier given through the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund of NABARD (for domestic banks) and SIDBI (for foreign banks)
 lihaaja, purv kii karj dene kii vyavastha kii doosraa naam mudra yojana he or yadi yah yojana lagu hone ke baad nae rojgaar ke srijan main madad mili he to jaahir he purv main bhi in karjon ke jariye rojgaar srijan kaa kaam hua hoga

 apane bhaashan main trump ne iran ke newclear or belistic missile program or madhya purv main charampanthiyon ke samarthan ko lekar or zyada aakraamak rukh apnaane ke sanket die hai
 Indicating the future of the deal, the US President said that Iran is not following the agreement and that their goal is to ensure that Iran does not make nuclear weapons
 trump ne iran ke islamic revolutionari gord corps par pratibandh lagane ke sanket dete hue tehran kii jamkar aalochana kii or syria, yaman or iraq main america karrwai main baadha pahunchane kaa aarope lagaaya
 The US President said that we cannot walk on the path that ends with too much violence, extreme terror and also threatens Iran's nuclear weapons
 iran ko lekar trump ke aakraamak rukh kii isroyal ne tarif kii he, jise iran kaa dhur virdohi mana jaataa he
 However, European allies have criticized Trump
 trump kaa yah kadam unki antarrashtriya samjhauton main 'america first' niti ke tahat dekha ja rahaa he
 Under which he separated the US from the Paris Climate Agreement and the trans-pacific Partnership Trade Talk
 iske alaava canada or mexico ke saath north american free trade agreement par dobaaraa baatcheet kii
 This new policy of America has angered Tehran
 saath hi samjhaute ke duusare saajhedaaron ke bich washington ko alag-thalag kar diya he
 Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union were also signatories to the agreement
 inamen se kai saare deshon ko iran ke saath vyapaar ke morch par phayda mila he
 Responding to Trump, Iran's President Hassan Rohani said on Friday that Tehran is firm on the agreement
 rohani ne trump ko aadharahin aarope lagane vaala bataaya
 He said that Iran and nuclear deals are stronger now
 iran kisi bhi bahari takat ke saamne kabhi nahin jhukegaa

 Political debates should go on
 loktantr ke vibhinn angon ke bich santulan ko nae sire se napate rahane main koi harj nahin he, lekin ye bahasein itani badi or lambii nahin honi chahie ki vyavastha ruk jaae or aam log saidhantik takaraavon ke boj tale dabakar marane lagen
 It is now almost the same situation in India between the judiciary and the legislature
 bauddhik manoranjan ke liye ham ise nyaayik sakriyata yaa loktantric sansthaaon ke bich santulan kii bahes kah sakate hai
 However, the reality is that the fundamental right to justice in India has been caught in a battle of prestige between politicians and judges and regretfully that the fight has been prolonged

 thakur ne sidhe pradhanmantri se hi jajon kii niyukti main deree kii kiafiyat puch lee
 Then BCCI President and BJP leader Anurag Thakur, the stronghold of all cricket disputes in India, not only challenged the Supreme Court order on transparency in the Cricket Board but also directly questioned the intention of the Chief Justice
 yah donon ghatnaayen bataati hai ki pichley saal nyaayik niyukti ayog (engeesi) par supreme court ke inkaar ke baad vidhayika or nyaaypalika ke bich avishvaas kitna gaharaa chukaa he
 The latest confrontation was initiated by the Congress, which was strictly disturbed by the courts over corruption
 upie sarkaar ke netritv main rajyasabha ne 2013 main nyaayik niyukti ayog (jeesi) vidheyak manjuur kiya tha jo jajon kii niyukti ke liye colegium (supreme court niyantrit) kii sthapana karata tha
 The bill was opposed by the BJP
 15veen loksabhaa bhang hone ke kaaran vidheyak nishprabhavi ho gaya
 After coming to power, the NDA showed great momentum in adopting the Congress campaign to control appointment in courts
 congress pehle se saath thi, isliye nae engeesi vidheyak par rajnatik sahmati ban gai
 The constitution of the commission was challenged in the Supreme Court and after a bitter argument over the rights of the court and the government, the Supreme Court in October last year rejected the Judicial Appointments Commission i
e
 NJAC and directed the government to make a process for new judicial appointments
 gave
 is faisle ke baad nai niyuktiyaan shuru honi chahie thim lekin takaraav kaa doosraa charan engeesi par adaalat ke nirnay ke baad shuru hua
 The government wants to retain the privilege of rejecting the recommendations of the Supreme Court Collegium on the appointment of judges and include it in the appointment process
 jaahir he, supreme court isse sahamat nahin hoga
 Due to this, the proposal of pending appointment of 75 judges in the High Court is pending with the Central Government, while about 400 judicial posts are lying vacant at different levels in the High Court
 india today ke 11 may ke ank main prakashit shodh agency ''daksh'" ke nishkarshon ke mutabik, adaalaton main teen karod maamle lambit hai
 Litigation takes an average of six years in the lower courts and three years in the High Court, while it takes 13 years to go to the Supreme Court
 nyaay maangane vaale, dhimi sunwaayee ke kaaran adaalaton main salanaa 30,000 karod ru

 nyaayadhishon kii kami aitihaasik he
 Chief Justice Thakur said in an event in the Odisha High Court in May that 70,000 judges are needed to handle pending cases, while the number of judges available is only 18,000
 patna, kolkata, hyderabad ke hycourt main jaj prati din 109 se 149 maamalon kii sunwaayee karte hai yani ausat do minute main ek sunwaayee puri
 Reading this survey of Daksha, the debate of judicial activism seems meaningless
 paanch-chah saal main shaayad ek yaa do mukademe hi aise hote honge jinamein vidhayika or nyaaypalika ke adhikaron ke santulan par asar padataa ho
 66 per cent of the cases in the country are related to land disputes and the remaining cases are about acquiring basic rights or crime victims, there is no ambiguity in the constitution and the law
 adaalaton or sarkaar ke ek duusare par shaq or adhikaron main dakhal kii ladaai bhartiya loktantr jitani aitihaasik ho chali he or isamen sarkaron ke badalane se koi fark nahin aayaa he
 Most of the time of the judiciary in the last 70 years has been spent in political confrontations with governments
 nehru ke daur main sampatti ke adhikaar ko lekar adalati faisle se lekar indira gandhi ke daur main sansad kii simaaen tay karne vaale nirnay or immergency tak shaayad hi kabhi aisa hua, jab lambey samay tak sarkaar or adaalaton ne ekajute hokar kaam kiya he
 Despite this long history, the latest issue of confrontation is more disturbing because people are more aware than before
 bhrashtachar maanavadhikaar chin rahaa he or sarkaar ke prati avishvaas va raajnneeti se mohabhang ke kaaran loktantric adhikaar or seva ke taur par nyaay kii maang sabase zyada he
 In the light of pending cases in the courts, the challenge of justice in India is not constitutional and legal, rather it is a challenge to infrastructure, labor force and order that needs resources, judges and technology to overcome, not political debate
 lekin sarkaar or nyaaypalika ke bich lambey samay se chal rahi saidhantik khinchataan ne nyaay vyavastha ko nichle str tak bandhak bana liya he
 Politicians and courts must ask themselves whether the debate on their rights is so important that people should stop getting basic justice
 Can we not do justice to the millions of people who do not mind changing governments and judges even after doing these debates? alabatta adaalaton main edinan ghiste-ghiste unki jindagi khatm hoti ja rahi he
 Swapan Debnath, Minister of Small Medium Industries (medium Enterprises) in the Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal has made an absurd statement
 debanath ne kaha ki sipiem kii kuch mahilaayein apane blouse khud fadkar jhuthe aarope lagaati hai taaki hamen fansaa saken
 Debnath said during a rally in Burdwan that we know policemen who arrest their own sons to get promotions
 thik usee tarah sipiai-em main kuch aisi mahilaayein hai, jo hamen fansaane ke liye khud ke blouse faad leti hai
 When some of the people present at the rally started clapping on Debnath's statement, Debnath said that if these women also beat their husbands at home, then they accuse the Trinamool Congress of this

 While the Delhi government is preparing to count its successes on its second anniversary, the Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Vijender Gupta, has released the government's report card
 report card main gupta ne sarkaar ko das main se jiro number diye hai
 According to Gupta, Chief Minister Kejriwal is missing from Delhi most of the time

 In such a situation, Delhi did not get anything in two years, but Delhi has suffered due to the Aam Aadmi Party government, where people are also getting worried for basic facilities

 Manvendra Singh, son of BJP MLA and BJP veteran Jaswant Singh, has given a big statement on Saturday
 darasal, unhone barmer ke pachapadara main swabhimaan raily kii
 In this rally, he declared an open rebellion from the BJP
 maanavendra singh ne manch se elaan kiya- 'hamaari ek hi bhul,kamalka phool
 It is clear that now the path of BJP and Manvendra has been separated
 maanavendra singh vaise to vasundhara raaje se tab se naaraaz chal rahe the jab se unke pita jaswant singh kaa tikat barmer loksabhaa seat se kaata gaya tha
 But two months before the election, the announcement of Manvendra's BJP opposition by rallying the Rajputs in this way has created a crisis in Barmer for the BJP
 swabhimaan raily main bolte hue maanavendra singh kii patni chitra singh ne kaha ki hamen is raily se vasundhara raaje tak yah aawaaj pahunchaa deni he ki ab vah mahaj do maheene ke liye rajasthan ke mukhyamantri hai
 Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje is to be overthrown in the coming assembly elections
 pachapadara raily main sabhi vaktaaon ne vasundhara sarkaar par prahaar kiya
 The way the crowd gathered at the rally is not a good sign for the BJP
 is raily main bhavuk apil kii gai ki jaswant singh ke jo halaat bane hai uske liye kahin na kahin mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje jimmedaar hai or hamen iskaa badla lenaa he
 It is believed that Manvendra Singh will hold the hand of the Congress, but in response to this question, he said that the public will do what he says
 janata ke iraadon or bhaawanaaon ke saath chalenge
 Till now Manvendra Singh was not openly speaking against BJP and was saying that Swabhiman would clear his side in the rally
 lekin aaj saaf saaf kar diya he ki bijepi ke saath nahin he or vasundhara raaje sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye kaam karenge yani ab maanavendra singh congress kaa haath tham sakate hai
 However, the Congress leaders are speaking very loudly on this matter
 unka kahana he ki jo bhi congress kii vichaardhaara ke saath aana chahega, uskaa ham swaagat karenge
 As soon as the rally was over, there was a crowd in Hungamamanvendra Singh's rally but at the end of the rally two Rajputs were torn
 karani sena ke log maanavendra singh ko gher kar narebaaji karne lage
 Seeing the situation worsening, the police used mild force to drive the Karni army from there and evacuate Manvendra Singh from there
 maanavendra singh baad main apni gaadi chhod patrakaron kii gaadi main baith batch kar nikle
 Back-to-back, the Karni Sena crowd was running slogans against Manvendra
 karani sena ke netaa nahin the manch parkarni sena kaa kahana tha ki maanavendra kii raily main bheed unki vajah se juty thi
 But Karni Sena national president Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi and Haryana's Karni Sena leader Ammu were not invited to the dais
 jaise hi raily khatm hui bairicade tod kar narebaaji karte hue karani sena ke kaaryakarta manch kii taraf lapke
 After that, shouting slogans surrounded Manvendra
 halaat tanaavpurn ho gaya tha aise main police ne kisi tarah se maanavendra ko vahaan se bachaa kar nikaala
 On this whole matter Manvendra Singh said that we had not called him
 ye hamaari raily thi isliye hamane manch par nahin bulaayaa jabaki karani sena kaa kahana tha ki maanavendra kii sabha main unki vajah se rajputon ke bheed ai thi varanaa maanavendra singh ke saath bheed nahin he

 isi kadi main mangalvaar ko congress adhyaksharahul gandhirajasthan kedholpurpahunche or chunaav abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi said at a rally in Dholpur that for four and a half years Narendra Modi is the Prime Minister and Vasundhara ji is the CM in Rajasthan, but did he do anything for the state
 jab hamaari centre sarkaar thi to hamane logon ko manaregaa diya, 70 hajaar karod rupee kaa karj maaf kiya or iske alaava rajya kii ashok gahalot sarkaar ne rajya kii haalat sudhari thi
 The Modi government did nothing for the poor, farmers and laborers
 'sirf amiron kaa karj maaf'congress adhyaksh rahul ne kaha ki hamaari sarkaar ne kisaanon kaa 70 hajaar karod rupaya maaf kiya, lekin narendra modi ne apni sarkaar main hindustan ke 15-20 amiron kaa saadhe teen lakh karod rupee kaa karja maaf kiya
 He said that these include the names of Vijay Mallya, Mehul Choksi and Nirav Modi
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki main sirf pradhanmantri ke daftar main ek baar gaya hum or sirf unase kisaanon ke karjamaafee kii baat kii
 i went to his office and said that you are not the prime minister of billionaires
 jab maine pradhanmantri se kisaan kaa karj maaf karne kii baat kahi, lekin unhone koi jawaab nahin diya
 He kept watching me silently
 'chunaav se pehle vasundhara ne kiya elaan'raily main congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki vasundhara ji chunaav se thik pehle kahati hai ki main muft main bijli duungin, lekin vasundhara ji chaar saal se kya kar rahi thim
 On one hand, the Prime Minister does not forgive the debt of farmers, but he has a brother-brother relationship with Nirav modi-mehul Choksi
 narendra modi, mehul chokasee ko bhai bulaate hai
 The Congress President, the 'chowkidar of Prime Minister Anil Ambani', said that when the Prime Minister was contesting the election, he had said that he would become the watchman, not the Prime Minister
 lekin unhone ye nahin bataaya tha ki wo kiski chaukeedaari karenge, narendra modi aaj anil ambani kii chaukeedaari karte hai
 He snatched the Rafale plane deal from HAL and gave it to Anil Ambani
 is deal main pradhanmantri ne bhrashtachar kiya he
 Anil Ambani has a debt of Rs 45000 crore
 rahul bole ki anil ambani ke paas rafel vimaan banane kaa koi anubhav nahin tha, france ke saath hui deal se 10 din pehle hi unki company bani thi
 The Modi government had directly told France that if there was a deal, it would be with Anil Ambani's company
 aaj pradhanmantri meri aankh main aankh nahin mila sakate hai
 'small businessmen troubled by Gabbar Singh tax' The Congress President said that Narendra Modi's government has hurt small businesses by implementing 'gabbar Singh Tax'
 inhone manaregaa kaa majaak udaaya, jabaki manaregaa ne garibon kii madad kii thi
 The BJP slogans shouted 'beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' but their MLA in UP rapes the woman and the CM of the place saves her
 pradhanmantri ne ek baar bhi nahin kaha ki isko party se nikaal do
 Rahul said that i tell you the true slogan which is 'beti Padhao, save from BJP MLA'
 'lalit modi ko bhi gheraa'raily ko sambodhit karte hue rahul gandhi ne lalit modi kaa bhi naam liya or kaha ki lalit modi ne vasundhara sarkaar ke saath milakar ghotaalaa kiya he
 Let me tell you that the Congress government is coming to Rajasthan, which will be the government of the poor
 aaj gujarat main uttar pradesh, bihar ke logon ko maar kar bhagaaya ja rahaa he
 He said that today when you take a selfie, you get a job in China, even on mobile it is written Made in China
 unhone kaha ki main chahta hum ki agar china main koi selfi le to us phone ke peeche maid in dhaulpur likhaa ho
 During this, he said that women are looking less in the rally today, i want women to join the Congress and they get a place in the rally
 ashok gahalot or sachin payalat ne vasundhara ko gheradhulpur raily main ashok gahalot ne kaha ki vasundhara ke prati puure rajasthan main gussa he
 The last time he got a majority he did not use it properly, Vasundhara Raje ruined Rajasthan
 kaarykram main congress netaa sachin payalat ne kaha ki rajasthan main vasundhara ji ne 5 saal tak kushasan kiya
 This is the home district of the Chief Minister, but the CM disappointed the people here
 unhone yahaan ke logon kii madad nahin sirf unka shoshan kiya he
 The pilot said that he did not remember the farmers for 4 years, 19 months and 16 hours, but half an hour before the elections, he remembered the farmers and announced them for them
 BSP ke vot bank par najaryupi se lage is ilaake main basapa kaa bhi prabhaav he or basapa pehle hi rajasthan main akele chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar chuki he
 In this context, Rahul's roadshow also matters in this area
 rajasthan main vidhansabha chunaav ke liye 7 disambar ko vot daale jaaenge
 The political equation of Dhaulpur falls in Dhaulpur district Bharatpur division and has a total of 4 assembly seats, out of which 3 seats are for general category, while 1 seat is reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC)
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress 2 siton par jeet mili thi
 Whereas BJP and BSP got 1-1 seats
 aisa tab tha jabaki puure rajya main congress 200 main se mahaj 21 seat hi jeet pai thi

 How can India trust Pakistan? a few days ago, we had revealed how the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif wants to keep the issue of 'plan K' meaning Kashmir
 or ab pakistan kii ek or badi karatuut saamne ai he
 Pakistan has assigned the Haqqani network (local terrorist organization in Afghanistan) to kill Indian Ambassador Amar Sinha in Kabul
 darasal, pakistan nahin chahta ki bharat ke rishte padosi mulkon se behatar hon
 If the terrorists attack the Indian ambassador, it will be a blow to the relationship between the two countries (india and Afghanistan)
 bharat ne afghanistan ke vikaas main kaaphi madad kii habharat sarkaar ko jaise hi isaki jaankaree mili, turant kabul main bhartiya rajdoot amar sinha ko chetaya gaya
 He was instructed to leave the house wearing a bulletproof jacket

 An official said that it was a specific alert

 Clearly, by attacking our ambassador, he wants us to step back from our work

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had to say that industrial investment is not growing, which was an indirect comment on Make in India
 yah fehrist sarkaar kii asafalataaon kii nahin balki bade iraadon ke shuruyaat main hi thithak jane kii he
 Several years of the Modi government have started in the same morass which has trapped many previous experiments
 skiimon ke dizin main khami, kriyanvayan tantra kii kamajori, doorgaami soch kii kami or spasht lakshyon kaa abhaav bhartiya gavarnence kii buniyadi chunauti he
 Modi got the mandate to reform this governance
 unhone isamen sudhaar kaa saahas dikhaae bagaiyr puraane system par nae mishan or scimen thope deen
 This is the reason that the nullity of the results in the first year has overshadowed the grandeur of intent
 sarkaar ke ek saal ke kaamkaaj kaa byoraa banaate hue centre sarkaar ke mantralay khaasi mushkil se do-chaar the
 Government ministries were finding such achievements difficult to establish with figures
 koyala khadaanon or spectrum aavanton (jo sarkaar ke saamaanya kaamkaaj kaa hissaa he) ko chhodkar mantralayon ke paas bataane ke liye kuch thos isliye nahin tha, kyonki tamaam iraadon or ghoshnaaon ke baavjood sarkaar ek aisi skim yaa sudhaar ko taras gai jisaki uplabdhi sahaj hi mahasoos karai ja sake
 a cursory examination of all the Modi government's campaigns and schemes will make anyone realize that the schemes were not only fabricated in a provisional manner but also not seen when and why such previous experiments have failed
 sabase bada achraj is baat kaa he ki ek se adhik kaarykram aise hai jinke saath na to kriyanyavan yojana he or na lakshya
 Therefore, the schemes got out of the discussion as soon as the publicity water came down
 swatchta mishan kaa haal dekhne laayak he, jo sadakon kii to chhodie, prachaar se bhi baahar he
 The Government's ad hocism and short-sightedness were immersed in a valuable campaign involving public enthusiasm
 ek saal main is mishan ke liye sansaadhan jutana to dur, ranneeti va lakshya bhi tay nahin ho sake
 The whole year has passed and the government has not been able to connect various agencies especially local bodies with the mission
 nagar nigamon ke rajasav ko chust karne kii ranneeti ke abhaav main gandagi apni jagah waapas mustaid ho gai he jabaki jhaadu lagaati hui chhaviyaan netaaon ke gharon main saji hai
 Now many people in the government have started to believe that it is useless to expect much from this mission
 sarkaar kii sarvaadhik prachaarit skim jan dhan doordarshita or sooyeeboojh kii kami kaa shikaar hui he
 The scheme failed to align with the financial behavior of the people for whom it was intended
 50 fisadi khate to niskriy hai, durghatana beemaa or overdraft ne koi utsaah nahin jagaaya
 When there is no money in accounts, there is no work of rupay card
 skim ke niyamon ke mutabik, puraa madhyavarg jan dhan se baahar he
 On the other hand, new insurance schemes suggest that nothing has been learned from the failure of previous experiments
 in skiimon ko lagu karne vaala prashasnic tantra, bajtiy sahaayta or lakshya to nadaarad hai hi, skiimon ke praavdhaanon main gahari visangatiyaan hai
 The benefits accruing from them are so limited (eg Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 at the age of 60 after contributing for twenty years
 prati maah kii pension) ki logon main utsaah jagana mushkil he
 Their designs prevent them from becoming popular while their inconsistencies do not make them a better business option for insurance companies
 apane maujuuda dhaanche main pradhanmantri kaa jansuraksha package lagbhag unheen visangatiyon se las he, aam aadmi beemaa, jan shri, varisht pension or swaavlamban jaisi kareeb aadha darjan scimen jinka shikaar hui hai
 Major campaigns like Make in India, Adarsh gram, Digital India are also being dragged within a year, so the reasons are not ad hoc preparations but ad hoc preparations
 scimen, mishan or abhiyaan na keval taiyaariyon or gathan main kamjor the balki inhen usee pranali se lagu karaayaa gaya jisaki asafalataa asandigdh he
 Now after twelve months have passed, the government has started realizing that not only the schemes of the previous government have been adopted, but the imperfections of governance have been copy-pasted and hence the government's ambitious campaigns are moving towards uncomfortable results
 Huh
 narendra modi se tabadatod mishan or skiimon ke elaan kii ummid kisi ne nahin kii thi
 People were realizing that Modi has come up with a new idea of restructuring the governance, in which he will first fix this dinosaur government system in which the best initiative is difficult and if it does, then it swallows it
 lekin modi sarkaar ne to har maheene ek nai skim or mishan oochaal diya jise sanbhaalane or chalaane kaa dhaancha bhi taiyaar nahin tha
 From 'minimum Government, Maximum Governance', people had understood that Modi is talking about an agile and giving result government, but in a year most of his schemes and missions have created maximum government ie new bureaucracy and results are same Weak, as many used to be during the Congress era
 skiimon yaa mishnon kii vifaltaa nai nahin he
 The difficulty is that the grandeur with which the Modi government's intentions are presented, their failures can be equally grand
 narendra modi ko ab kism-kism kii skim va mishan kii deewangi chhodkar gavarnence sudhaarney or nattejey dikhaane kaa mishan shuru karnaa hoga nahin to mohabhang kii bhavyata ko sanbhaalanaa, unke liye mushkil ho jayega

 He wore gloves marked 'sacrificial Badge' during the match played against South Africa on Wednesday, which he now has to take off after the ICC said

 This badge is made of silver metal, with a red plastic rectangle on the top
 yah baij keval para-commando dwaara pahana jaataa he
 Click here to watch Dhoni's video
 How is this mark on Dhoni's gloves? What is Fact - Former Indian team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was given the rank of honorary lieutenant colonel in the Territorial Army in 2011 due to his achievements in cricket
 dhoni yah sammaan paane vaale kapil dev ke baad duusare bhartiya cricketer hai
 Dhoni was given an honorary commission as he is a youth icon and he can inspire the youth to join the armed forces
 dhoni ek prashikshit paratrupar hai
 He has taken a Para Basic course and wears paratrooper wings
 dhoni ke gloves par 'balidaan baij'mahendra singh dhoni ne pradeshik sena (tie) kii 106 parachute regiment main maanad leftinent karnal ke rup main apni rank ko sabit kar dikhaaya he
 Dhoni became a trained paratrooper in August 2015

 That is, Dhoni got the ability to use this badge

 Dhoni was conferred the Padma Bhushan in 2018, in December 2011, Dhoni was awarded the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Territorial Army (TA)
 tab unhone kaha tha ki vah sena main adhikari bananaa chaahate the, lekin kismat ne unhen cricketer bana diya
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni's decision to retire from Test cricket may be shocking to the people, but BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel says that it is not 'a hasty decision' but rather a lot of introspection and deliberation Has been done after
 patel ne dhoni ke saath hui is bare main hui baatcheet ke bare main zyada kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya
 Patel admitted that he knew that Dhoni wanted to skip one format of cricket so that he could concentrate on the other two formats
 ' Dhoni is a very practical person, today he telephoned after the test match in Melbourne and told that he wants to retire from Test cricket
 maine turant poocha, 'kyon kya hua chotil ho yaa or kuch
 ' usne shant ho kar jawaab diya, 'nahin main achche ke liye hi test cricket chhodna chahta hum
 Patel said, "he is the captain of the Indian team
 i should respect his personal choice
" ’’ patel ne kaha ki unhone dhoni se phir poocha ki kya uskaa yah faisla antim he tab usne kaha,‘‘ kripaya ruken mai is bare main saathiyon ko bataata hum uske baad aap adhikrut ghoshnaa kar sakate hai or usne waapas mujhe bataaya ki usne team ke khiladiyon ko is bare main bataa diya he aap is bare ghoshnaa kar sakate hai 
 '' maharashtra ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki shivaji park main shivasena pramukh bal thakare kii antyeshti ke liye di gayi ijaajat 'sashart' thi
 Chavan said, 'the permission given for the funeral at Shivaji Park was conditional
 mahayor or shivasena saansad sanjay raut ko vahaan se asthaayee smarak hataane ko jo notice bheja gaya he, uskaa matlab he ki karrwai chal rahi he
 'but when the Chief Minister was asked what the state government would do if Thackeray's temporary memorial was not removed from Shivaji Park, he refused to answer and simply said,' Don't expect me to answer this question here
 'arab sagar main chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kii prastaavit pratimaa ke bare main unhone kaha ki paryaavaran se is baat ke liye anumati lene kii prakriya chal rahi he
 Chavan had earlier said about Shiv Sena's demand to build a memorial to Bal Thackeray at Shivaji Park, saying that the state government would not do anything which is against the law
 unhone kaha tha ki shivaji park, jise shant kshetra ghoshit kiya gaya he, se sambandhit maamla ucch nyaayalay main lambit he
 He had said that the government is of the opinion that this is a recreation ground while the court says that it is a playground where no construction will be possible

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been struggling for political existence in West Bengal for the past several years, finally made a dent in Mamata Banerjee's stronghold in this Lok Sabha election
 saal 2014 main sirf 17 fisadi vot or 2 siten jeetne vaali bijepi ne is loksabhaa chunaav main pashchim bengal kii 18 siton par jeet darj kii
 While the ruling party Trinamool Congress (TMC) seats were reduced to 22
 bengal main vot share ko dekhen to isamen bhi mamata ke khilaaf bijepi ne baaji maari he or uskaa janaadhar bhi badha he
 Where BJP 40 in this Lok Sabha election
 25 fisadi vot mili hai vahiin tiemasi ko sirf teen fisadi zyada 43
 28 percent votes were received
 bengal main haashiye par ja chuki left party sipiai ko 1 fisadi se bhi kam or sipiem ko 6
 28 percent votes were received
 vahiin congress ko sirf 5 fisadi voton se santosh karnaa padaa
 The party gained widespread support in areas such as Purulia, Bankura, Jhargram Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar
 bijepi ko mila mehnat kaa falloksabhaa chunaav se pehle bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne pashchim bengal main 23 siton kaa lakshya rakhaa tha jisamen se 18 par use kamyaabi mili
 In order to strengthen the bjp's base in West Bengal and present the BJP as an alternative to TMC, PM Modi and Amit Shah sweated heavily and held a total of 34 rallies there
 ab bijepi ko iskaa fal 18 siton ke rup main mila he
 During this period, TMC-BJP activists witnessed a lot of violent clashes in Bengal, in which many people died
 pashchim bengal main bijepi ke paksh main aae in nateezon ne mamata banerjee ke maathe par chintaa kii lakeeren khinch di he
 Accepting the defeat, CM Mamata Banerjee congratulated the BJP for the victory and said that after the full results, she will reflect on this among the party workers
 kyon darak gaya mamata kaa kilabijepi kii shandaar jeet ke baad pashchim bengal ko lekar jo sabase bada sawaal logon ke jehan main he wo ye he ki aakhirkaar bengal kii sherni maani jane vaali mamata banerjee ke kile main bijepi ne kaise sendhamari kar di
 Mamta Banerjee had once alleged about the growing influence of BJP that it seems that there has been a secret deal between BJP, Congress and Left in Bengal which is against me
 iskaa matlab yah he ki mamata ko andaja to tha ki pashchim bengal main bijepi kaa prabhaav bad rahaa he or left or congress ke kor voters bhi usee kii taraf shift ho rahe hai
 The election results that have come are also confirming this
 sipiem or sipiai jaisi left partiyon ke kor voter ne jamkar bijepi ke paksh main vot kiya jabaki congress ke voters ko bhi ab lagane laga he ki rajya main mamata ke khilaaf bijepi hi ekmaatr vikalp he isliye unhone khulkar vot kiya
 The issue of NRC and illegal Bangladeshis hurt Mamata Mamata Banerjee's attitude towards illegal citizens (muslims) coming from Bangladesh in West Bengal and Kolkata has always been soft and warm about NRC
