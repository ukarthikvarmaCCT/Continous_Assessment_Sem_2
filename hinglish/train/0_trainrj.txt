 anil ambani kii hatya kii sajeesh ke maamle main sansanikhej mode aa gaya he
 Bharat Bhorge, a witness in the case, died under mysterious circumstances
 bhorge kaa shav mangalvaar ko mumbai ke ek railway stesan ke paas padaa mila
 Bhorge was a mechanic
 inhone hi ambani ke helicopter main sabase pehle kankad-pattharon ko dekha tha
 These pebbles could damage the engine and cause a helicopter crash
 mana ja rahaa he ki yah anil ambani kii hatya kii sajeesh ho sakati he
 Bharat's body was found in a severed condition from the local train
 udhar helicopter main todphod ke maamle kii jaanch kar rahi mumbai police ne ab director general of civil aviation (dijisie) or visheshgyon se is masale par raay maangi he taaki jaanch ke nateezon ko pukhta kiya ja sake

 virendra sahvaag or tej gendbaajon kii shandaar farm se vaapasi karne vaali bhartiya team trikoniya ekadivasiy cricket shrinkhalaa ke final menshanivaar ko lig charan kii sharmnaak haar kaa badla chuktaa karne or srilankai sarajameen par lagaataar doosraa khitaab jeetne ke liye maidan par utregi
 India and Sri Lanka were earlier face to face in the final of the Asia Cup in June, in which Mahendra Singh Dheni's team was successful in winning the title
 bharat ke liye trikoniya shrinkhalaa main khitaabi mukaable tak pahunchnaa asia cap jaisaa aasaan nahin rahaa he jabaki srilanka ko final tak pahunchane main adhik dikkat nahin hui
 India defeated New Zealand by 105 runs in the final to make it to the finals
 trikoniya shrinkhalaa ke dauraan suraj randiv kii virendra sahvaag ko kii gayi vivaadaaspad nobal ne bharat or srilanka ke bich cricketia sambandhon par bhi asar padane laga tha
 Now that both the teams are face to face, then both will leave no stone unturned in beating each other
 match kaa parinaam kya rahegaa iske bare main kuch bhi kahana mushkil hoga kyonki yahaan adhiktar aasmaan badalon se ghira rahaa he or baad main ballebaaji karnaa aasaan nahin rahaa he
 In such a situation, Tas has played an important role
 newjiland ke khilaaf 105 ran kii jeet se aisa lagata he ki bhartiya team joardaar farm main he lekin kahani isse vipareet he
 Barring Sehwag, no other Indian batsman has been able to perform well so far, which is a matter of concern for the team
 match se pehle or baad kii press kanfrence main shabdic jang ladi gayi lekin maidan par ab tak srilanka kaa palada bharat par kuch baari rahaa he
 For the first time in his career, Tisara Perera took the wicket of the Indian team for the most remaining defeat in terms of remaining the ball
 bharat ne haalanki newjiland ke khilaaf karo yaa maro mukaable main acchhee vaapasi kii lekin is match main bhi uski ballebaaji kii kamajoriyaan khulkar saamne aayi
 The young batsmen in particular failed to live up to the expectations
 sachin tendulkar or gautam gambhir kii anupasthiti main viraat kohli or suresh raina jaise khilaadiyon par kaaphi jimmedaari thi lekin abhi tak ve naakaam rahe hai
 Sehwag's best innings cannot save India from the crisis all the time and now it is imperative that batsmen like Yuvraj Singh use their experience to do well
 srilanka kii anushaasit gendbaaji ke saamne haalanki yah aasaan nahin hoga jise perera ke rup main ek or majboot gendbaaj mil gaya he
 Apart from him, reliable bowlers like Lesith Malinga and Angelo Mathews are also in the Sri Lankan team which will not make it easy for the Indians to score runs
 bharat kaa daaromadar praveen kumaar, ashish nehra or ishanth sharma kii tej gendbaaji kii trimurti par bhi tikaa hua he
 The way they had blown away the top of New Zealand in the previous match, if the same performance was successful in the final too, then the Indian team will be bat
 team is prakaar he:bharat:mahendra singh dhoni (captain), virendra sahvaag, viraat kohli, suresh raina, rohit sharma, yuvaraj singh, ravidanr jadeja, dinesh karthik, aar aswin, praveen kumaar, ishanth sharma, abhimanyu mithun, ashish nehra, pragyan ojha, saurabh tiwari or munaf patel main se

 According to beliefs in Hinduism, Mother Durga is depicted as a goddess of strength and oppressor of sinners
 inke naun swarup he jinamein unke prayek rup main prayek devi ke alag-alag vaahan va alag-alag astr- shastr he
 But it is said that they are all the same
 maa durga ke in sabhi swaroopon ko durga kaha jaataa he
 Mother Durga's grace is unconventional, she rides a lion, she is also called the goddess of war
 to aaiye aaj ham aapako bataate hai maa durga ke bare main
 
 
 Mother power: - aisi manyata he ki devataaon kii rakshason se raksha karne ke liye maa durga kii uttapatti hui
 Despite the many names of Maa Durga, two names Gauri and Kali are main
 devi gauri kaa swaroop behad sundar or shant he, to vahiin unka sabase vikaraal rup he maa kaali kaa
 
 
 According to beliefs, the mother Kali takes the rosary of sinners in a formidable form, with a garland of male goons around her neck and arms in her hands
 hinduon kii pramukh devi hai maa durga
 They are a symbol of power
 hindu dharm kii pramukh devi durga kii tulana param brahm se kii jaati he
 Durga is considered the warring goddess
 manyata he ki ve shaanti, samruddhi or dharm ke maarg par bhatakane vaale or rakshasi shaktiyon kaa naash karti hai
 This is the reason why she is also considered as the goddess of power
 hindu manyata ke anusaar maa durga ko bhagwaan shiv kii patni yani mata parvati kaa hi ek rup mana jaataa he
 In the Upanishads, Mother Durga is described as the daughter of Uma Haimavati i

 lekin agali hi subah soni ne bhi dam tod diya
 Soni's husband Rajagattu was the first victim of vector-borne disease in his family
 rajagttu ek privet skool main bataur teacher kaam karte the
 Earlier he had complained of high fever after which he was admitted to the hospital in the district
 teen din baad 16 oktober ko unki haalat bighad gai or doctoron ne unhen karimnagar le jane ke liye kaha joki hyderabad se 160 kimi dur he
 He died on the way

 bhartiya communist party (bhakpa) ne vitt varsh 2012-13 ke liye shuukravaar ko loksabhaa main pesh aam bajet ko 'aprabhavi' qaraar dete hue kaha ki isi prakaar kaa bajet pesh karnaa tha to iske liye kendriya vitt mantri ke rup main pranab mukherjee kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin thi, yah to lipic bhi taiyaar kar sakate the
 CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta said, 'this is a completely clerical budget
 ise kendriya vitt mantralay ke lipikon dwaara hi taiyaar kiya ja saktaa tha
 This did not require Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee
 'bajet ko aprabhavi qaraar dete hue unhone kaha, 'isamen kisi bhi mudde par dhyaan kendrit nahin kiya gaya he
 There is a nominal increase in social welfare
 rojgaar srijan ke liye bhi yojana nahin banaai gai he

 Not only Rahul but other parties have also gone in support of the farmers
 congress adhyaksh ne mangalvaar ko twit kar likhaa, ''vishwa ahimsa diwas par BJP kaa do-varshiya gandhi jayanti samaaroh shantipurvak dilli aa rahe kisaanon kii barbar pitayee se shuru hua
 Now the farmers cannot come to the capital of the country and express their pain ''
 # breakingnewsvisva ahimsa diwas par BJP kaa do-varshiya gandhi jayanti samaaroh shantipurvak dilli aa rahe kisaanon kii barbar pitayee se shuru hua
 Now the farmers cannot come to the capital of the country and express their pain! party ne apane sabhi kaaryakartaaon se bhi apil kii he ki wo bhi vahaan par pahunche
 Please tell that on Tuesday, the march led by Indian Farmers Union reached Ghaziabad and there was a clash with the police here
 up-dilli border par police ne yahaan par bairicading kar di thi, jahaan kisaan or police ke bich tikhi bahes ho gai
 During this time, the police used water cannons and released tear gas shells to stop them
 kisaanon-sarkaar main ban gai batahaalanki, lathicharge-jhadap ke baad sarkaar kii taraf se kisaanon ko manaane kii koshishen kii gayi
 After this struggle, representatives of the farmers met with Home Minister Rajnath Singh
 is dauraan krishi rajyamantri gajendra singh shekhavat bhi maujuud rahe
 After the meeting, the Minister of State for Agriculture gave a statement that most of the demands have been agreed, farmers are being informed about this
 kisaan netaaon se baatcheet ke dauraan hi rajnath singh ne bhakiu pramukh naresh tikait se phone par bhi baat kii
 On the matter, JDU leader KC Tyagi said that this is the most heartless incident on farmers since independence
 kisaan andolan ke pehle hi din sarkaar ko kisaano se baat kerani chahie thi
 As well wishers of our NDA, the advice is that all the demands of the farmers should be accepted
 tyaagi ke mutabik, sarkaar ne jis tarah se swaminthaan kamishan ko aadhe-adhure tareeke se lagu kiya he or kisaanon ke liye jo anya kadam uthaae gaye hai usase santusht nahin hai
 The JDU leader further said that our demand is that when the Constitutional Commission of SC / ST, OBC can be constituted, then why cannot the National Farmers Commission of Farmers be created? Our appeal is that the government should form the Farmers Commission soon
 is saal apni sarajameen par lagaataar acha khel rahi bhartiya team newjiland ke khilaaf buudhvaar ko duusare ek divasiy cricket match main utregi, to sabhi kii nazren shandaar farm main chal rahe yuva ballebaaj viraat kohli par lagi hongi
 In the absence of star players, the young Delhi batsman has proved his usefulness by scoring a century in the first match in Guwahati
 mahendra singh dhoni, sachin tendulkar, virendra sahvaag, jahir khan or harbhajan singh kii gaiyr maujuudagi main kohli ne behtareen ballebaaji karke bharat ko 40 ran se jeet dilaai
 Prior to this, he has made two consecutive hundreds in the Ranji Trophy
 savai maansingh stadium par unka lakshya is form ko barkaraar rakhane kaa hoga
 India has won six matches out of ten at this ground
 aakhri match farvari main dakshin africa ke khilaaf khelaa gaya tha jo bharat ne ek ran se jeeta
 India have lost only one match on their soil in 2010 which was played against South Africa on 27 February
 bharat ne dakshin africa ko 2-1 se haraaya or austrailia se shrinkhalaa 1-0 se jiti
 In the second match too, playing New Zealand regulars Daniel Vettori and Brendon mccullum is doubtful, which can benefit India
 vittori kii peeth main sujan he, jabaki maikulam bhi anfit hai
 The Indian camp would have felt relieved to see Yuvraj Singh scoring runs in the first match
 bisisiai dwaara haal hi main anubandhit khilaadiyon kii suchi main bi shrenee main dhakele gaye yuvaraj ne aakraamak pari nahin kheli lekin 42 upyogi ran banaaye
 Acting captain Gautam Gambhir is also keen to play a big innings in the last home series before the World Cup
 powerple or death overon main rangati banaaye rakhane par bharat ko mehnat kerani hogi
 India lost the last six wickets in the first match within 26 runs
 jahaan tak gendbaaji kaa sawaal he to pehle match kii hi tarah bharat spinneron par nirbhar hoga
 r Ashwin bowled very economically in the middle overs and also took three important wickets
 es srisanth ne bhi teen wicket liye lekin aswin or yuvaraj kaa gend se yogadan utana hi mahatvapurn rahaa
 Dew can also play an important role in this match, so the team that wins the toss will prefer to choose fielding first, as it will be difficult to catch the ball later
 bengalooru ke banargattha rashtriya udyaan se ravivaar raat 8 saal kaa tendua pinjre se bhaag kar jangal main chalaa gaya
 6 teams of zoo and forest department officials are looking for him
 is tendue ko is maheene kii 7 tarikh ko bengalooru ke whitefield ke ek skool se 12 ghanton kii mehnat ke baad pakadaa gaya tha
 During this period, four personnel including an officer of the Forest Department were injured
 iske baad agle hi din kuch logon ne is ilaake main der shaam 2 tenduon ko dekhne kaa daawa kiya
 If there was chaos, 130 schools in the area were closed the next day as a precaution
 haalanki wo donon tendue van vibhaag kii giraft main nahin aaye
 Cages were also installed in many places but all efforts went in vain
 ab wo tendua chidyaghar se bhaag niklaa he jo is skool se pakadaa gaya tha
 According to the zoo's executive director Santosh Kumar, it seems that the cage door was not closed properly while giving food at night and he ran away
 santosh kumaar kaa kahana he ki ye tendua aadamkhor nahin he, aise main logon ko pareshaan hone kii zarurat nahin he
 At the same time, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah ordered to take strict action against those people, due to whose negligence this leopard escaped
 vahiin karnataka ke mukhyamantri siddharamaiya ne un logon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai karne kaa aadesh diya jinaki laaparvaahee se ye tendua bhaag niklaa
 People generally know Bihar as a political, historical and cultural center
 uski prakritik chata ke bare main shaayad hi koi baat karata he
 Yes, it is true that most of the forested area of bihar went to Jharkhand in 2000 after the bifurcation of the state
 bihar kii prakritik viraasat itani samrudh he ki sirf 30 foot kii gaharaai par hi pani mil jaataa he or zyaadaatar maamalon main mashin se boring kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 People's attachment to nature can be seen clearly
 bargad or pipal ke chhayaadaar vrikshon ke alaava duusare falon ke ped har kahin dekhe ja sakate hai
 Unfortunately, the natural heritage of this state has not been properly introduced
 ji haa, yah ek tathy he ki bodhgaya, nalanda vishvavidhyalay (rajgir), vaishali yaa duusare aitihaasik sthaan logon ko zyada aakarshith karte hai, jabaki pashchimi champaran main valmiki nagar ke aasapaas ke jangalon kii taraf logon kaa dhyaan nahin jaataa
 However, these forests are shelters for many rare animals such as tigers
 bihar main vanyajiwan bhi fal-phool rahaa he
 Dolphins and crocodiles are also part of the wildlife here, but hardly any tourists pay attention to them
 agar aap prakruti premi hai to bihar kii andekhi karnaa asambhav he
 After visiting Valmiki Tiger Reserve, Kakolat waterfall, and equal cave here, you will not forget your experience soon
 kerala ke mere ek dost ne bihar ke bare main kaha tha, ''bihar kii ek-ek inch jameen kaa upyog yaa to yahaan ke logon yaa phir kudarat ne bahut acchhee tarah se kiya he
 "nature has looted its hand over Bihar with open arms that extend from the foothills of the Himalayas in the north to the Ganges River in the south a few miles away
 ganga puure rajya main pashchim se purab tak bahati he
 The Gangetic plains in Bihar are extremely fertile
 lahalhate khet or hare-bhare baag-bageeche is rajya ke prakritik vaibhav kii jhalak dene ke liye kaaphi hai
 Greenery and fertile land everywhere adds to the natural beauty of this state
 agali baar jab aap bodhgaya ghoomane kii yojana banaaen to makhdumpur bazaar ke baad baraabar gufaaon kii ore mud jaaen
 These are the oldest rocky caves believed to be associated with the period of the Maurya Empire
 apane vihangam najaare ke liye mashhoor ye gufaaen dekhne waalon ko hatprabh kar detii hai
 The serene and completely pollution-free environment here provides strange peace and freshness to the mind
 ye gufaaen rajdhani patna se 75 kimi dur jahanabad ke pahari ilaake main sthit hai
 If your interest towards this place increases, then you will also start to carefully look at the records of the time of Emperor Ashoka on the stones
 ye gufaaen baraabar (chaar gufaaen) or nagarjuni (teen gufaaen) parvaton par sthit hai
 Most of the equal caves have two chambers or chambers, made of granite
 inaki bhitari sataha par bahut ucch str kii polish kii gai he or ye bahut romaanchak pratidhwaniyaan paidaa karti hai
 If your mind is not filled with the sight of jungle, waterfalls and caves, then you will be thrilled by seeing the dolphins found in the rivers of Bihar and your mind will become elated like a child
 meraa maananaa he ki dolphin har kisi kaa man moh leti hai
 They are considered to be extremely intelligent and sociable creatures
 bharat main dolphinon ko gangaji kaa vaahan samajha jaataa he
 They are found in large numbers in the rivers of Bihar
 sarkaar ke shaikshik or sangrakshnatmak prayaason ke kaaran puure pradesh main dolphinon ko dekhnaa lokapriy manoranjan ho gaya he
 If you go to Vikramshila Ganga Dolphin Sanctuary in Bhagalpur district of Bihar, you will get to see many dolphins there
 bharat main ganga main pai jane vaali 2,000 dolphinon main se 1,300 dolphin akele bihar main hi hai
 There are a large number of dolphins in all the rivers like Ghaghra, Gandak, Kosi, Brahmaputra, Mahananda, Kamala and Ganga
 rajgir main ghoda katoraa kii prakritik sundarataa bihar ke kuch anya aakarshanon main shaamil he
 Horse bowl lake is very beautiful
 mana jaataa he ki yah vah jagah he, jahaan jaraasandh kaa astabal hua karata tha
 This lake is situated in a green valley in Rajgir
 is jagah ko pradooshan se puri tarah mukt bataaya jaataa he
 The Gridhakuta peak is considered the peak of the vultures
 yahaan badi sankhya main giddh aate hai
 Lord Buddha stayed at this place for a long time after attaining enlightenment
 isiilie yah jagah buddha dharm ke anuyaayiyon ke liye atyant pavitra maani jaati he
 It is a quiet place and is very much preferred for walking
 bihar kii samrudh samskruti or prakritik viraasat ko puure pradesh main har kahin dekha ja saktaa he

 PM Narendra Modi is getting praises in Japan
 unke is daure ne bharat-japan ke rishton par padi dhul ko na keval hataa diya balki usamen ek nai chamak bhi laa di he
 There has not been any Prime Minister of India as he was welcomed there
 itnaa hi nahin vahaan unhone bharat ke vikaas ke liye paryaapt fund muhaiyaa karaane kaa bhi vachan le liya
 The purpose of his visit was to promote the development of India and rejuvenate the old relationships and he was fully successful in it
 japan ne bharat ko uske vikaas ke liye 35 arab dollar kaa aashwaasan bhi diya he or bhartiya kaarobaariyon ke liye raste bhi khole hai
 Modi will become so popular in Japan
 aisa kabhi sochaa bhi nahin gaya tha
 His innate nature and the art of communicating directly to the public made him a "hero" there
 vahaan ke akhbaar unki prashansa se ate pade hai
 For the last few years, India's foreign policy was becoming us-centric, but now there has been a tremendous change in the situation after Modi became Prime Minister
 japan iskaa bada udhaaharan he
 He welcomed Modi wholeheartedly, realizing our defense needs and asked for help and technology
 usase bhi badi baat yah rahi ki usne bharat ke raksha pratishthanon par se lagbhag 16 saal purana pratibandh hataa liya
 By winning the hearts of the people of Bhutan and Nepal before Modi, Modi left no stone unturned to prove that it is more important to improve relations with neighbors in his eyes
 kul milakar dekha jaae to modi ne videsh niti main nai urja paidaa kar di he or bharat koek nai qatari main khadaa karne kii koshish kii he
 India's foreign policy had stood at a crossroads for many years and it was not being decided who we were with and who was with us
 ab yah dhundh puri tarah se chant gai he
 It is to be seen what Modi does in the US this month and what is the attitude of the US government
 modi sarkaar ke sau din ho gaye
 a hundred days is a very short period in the life of any nation, but in the case of a new government it seems too big
 modi sarkaar ne kai kadam uthaae or kai chizon ko durust kiya
 He and his ministers worked very hard
 unke mantriyon main anubhav kii kami he lekin kathin parishram se ve uski bharpai karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Modi has also not allowed corruption to erupt around his cabinet and every major step is being blown up
 is sarkaar kii sabase badi khubi he ki isane rashtrahit ko sarvopari mana he or us disha main hi kaam kiya he
 It is true that out of the big promises that Modi had made, there is still a lot of work to do
 sabase bada kaam mahangaai rokane kaa he jo desh kii sabase badi samasya he
 For this, they have to take big steps
 itnaa hi nahin unhen un adhure kaamon ko puraa karne main ji-jaan se jute janaa hoga jinaki baaten ve haal tak kar rahe the
 They have to take tough decisions so that the economy gets back on track and employment increases so that the crores of youth who are with them do not go away
 a big thank you to Nita Bhabhi! Krunal & i are lucky to have received so much support from @mipaltan & the RIL family which has helped us achieve so much in such a short time

 pakistan ke purv raashtrapati parvej musharraf ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko muslim virdohi or pakistan virdohi tehraaya
 He also said that he himself would have responded to Modi with a strong statement
 parvej musharraf ko phir ai kashmir kii yadamusharraf ne kaha ki modi pakistan ko koi khilonaa naa samajhen or wo pakistan ko thappad markar nahin samajha sakate
 In a special conversation with TVTN Managing Editor Rahul Kanwal, Musharraf spoke a lot about the dispute from Prime Minister Modi to the border
 unhone seemaa par firing ke liye bharat par dosha madha or kaha ki pakistani fouj ko bharat kam karke naa anke
 Musharraf also criticized Nawaz Sharif
 unhone kaha ki bharat daure ke dauraan sharif ko hurriyat conference ke netaaon se bhi mulaakaat kerani chahie thi
 Read the entire conversation - should it be considered that given the current situation, there will be a sweetness in the india-pakistan relationship or will there be an altercation? Musharraf: i said this to Manmohan Singh sahab and Vajpayee sahab
 lagaataar kahata rahata hum ki rishton main behatari ke liye ham donon main teen chizon kaa hona jaruri he
 Honesty, flexibility and courage
 jaruri he ki ham ek-duusare ko sunen, sweekaar karen or give and tech kaa rishta rakhen
 But the way Prime Minister Narendra Modi takes the initial stance, there is a perception in Pakistan that he is anti-muslim, anti-pakistan
 jab se modi sahab ne satta sanbhali he, elosi par badi sakhti shuru ho gai he
 On that he gives such statements, which are strictly for Pakistan
 aise jaise pakistan koi khilonaa he, vah chup kara denge
 But i would like to say that if i were the head of Pakistan, i would have made a more strict statement of them
 kya aap maanate hai ki narendra modi or navaj sharif ke rahete daanon deshon ke bich rishte madhur ho paaenge?musharraf: ye hona chahie
 The continuation of the rift should end
 main jab bhi bharat jaataa tha hurriyat netaaon se miltaa tha
 It went wrong when our Prime Minister was prevented from meeting
 agar bharat ne is ore koi red line banaai he to vah uski red line he
 Narendra Modi is not our Prime Minister, so we do not believe it
 kya aap yah maan rahe hai ki pakistan kii sena kamjor pad gai he?musharraf: pakistani fouj bahut taqatvar fouj he
 She is not weak at all
 hindustan ko galatfahami main nahin rahanaa chahie ki ham kamjor pad gaye hai or threat ko phase nahin kar sakate
 Your army is bigger than us, but we are not weak
 hamaare paas newclear takat he, jo duniya ke liye bhi khatarnaak he
 Apart from this, Pakistan's traditional army also has so much power that it can not only stop but defeat India

 to kya puraani raah par chalanaa 22 saal se rajya main sattarudh rahi bhartiya janata party ke liye vijay roopaani ke naam par sahmati jataana raajnneetik majaburi thi
 The party knows that the victory this time has been more difficult than the previous 5 wins
 is baar congress ne kaaphi dam lagaaya or ummid se kahin zyada siten lekar ai

 On the evening of May 14 at 11 am in the shelter of Hanuman before the second round of revelations, on Saturday evening, before the big reveal, Shakkapil along with his wife Preeti and supporters arrived at the Hanuman temple in Connaught Place

 The havoc of nature has done its work jo barbaad karnaa tha kar diya
 Now it is the turn of humans made of nature
 qahar ne insaanon ko laash bana diya, to kuch insaan ab unheen laashon ko nochakar unamem apni laalchee jindagi talash rahe hai
 You must have seen and heard many stories and photos of the demons of Devbhoomi
 magar jo vakya ham aapako bataane ja rahe hai, use dekhne ke baad aap sirf ek hi baat kahenge
 
 
 'don't say we're human'
 kafan ke andar ek laash he
 The corpse of a woman, one of the hundreds of corpses, which was ravaged by the havoc of nature on the mountains of Uttarakhand on the night of 16 June
 ye laash kedarnath or gaurikund ke bich kisi jagah padi he
 The corpse has no claimant
 ek jallaad kafan ke bich se laash kii ungali baahar nikaalata he
 Nearby are all the tools of iron, which are going to be useful for him
 ab ek auzaar se wo laash kii ungali se sone kii anguthi nikaalane kii koshish karata he
 Along with this, some of his companions are also standing, who are also making videos of it from their mobile, but they are busy in their work
 is bich ek aurat kii awaz aati he, vah puuchhati he ki kisalie video bana rahe ho or ye kya kar rahe ho
 By ignoring the woman, she is still engaged in removing the ring of the corpse
 phir kuch der baad puri besharmi se hansate hue kahata he tumhen dene ke liye
 
 
 After saying this he himself tells how some Nepalese are looting and they will beat
 baton ke bich wo ab bhi puri jaddojahad kar rahaa he
 But perhaps the finger was also swollen along with the corpse, so even after all the efforts, the ring is not coming out
 isi bich koi kahata he ki plas se nikaal
 
 
 Remove from Plas
 ab wo plas se anguthi khinchne kii koshish karata he, par anguthi baahar nahin nikalati
 When the ring did not come out even after all the efforts, the ring was finally removed from the corpse by cutting a finger
 ek duusari sharmnaak tasviir
 
 
 Know the story of some such merchants of death, by seeing which you will be forced to think whether they really deserve to be called human beings too? People stranded in the mountains of Uttarakhand are being evacuated by helicopter
 par kya aapako pataa he ki kuch privet helicopter vaale jindagi bachaane ke liye bhi rishwat le rahe hai? rishwat is baat kii ki helicopter main pehle koun baithegaa
 Intelligence cameras were seen illegally seeking money to rescue GM of Sarathi Aviation
 lekin jab yahi sawaal unase sidhe camere par poocha gaya, to unhone aisa you-turn liya ki ham bhi dekhakar dang rah gaye
 Not only the army but many private airways companies are also engaged day and night in the battle to save lives in Uttarakhand
 jindagi or maut kii is jang main kai nijee companiyon ke operators dilli main khuleam rishwat lekar peediton ko Rescue kar rahe hai
 When Aaj Tak's Sting Operation lifted the curtain from this embarrassing story of rescue work, the truth came out that every single life was being spoken
 isi silsile main khufia camere par hamaari baat hui privet aviation company sarathi airways ke jiem deep raaj singh mehara se, jisase ye kaala dhandha ujagar ho gaya
 However, after this sting operation, when we talked to Deepraj Singh Mehra, the GM of the aviation company caught on open camera, he completely retracted from his earlier statement
 or to or, jab hamane unka sting oparation hone kii baat unhen yaad dilaai, to bhi wo behad beshikan tareeke se sari baton se inkaar karte nazar aae
 On this whole issue, the Uttarakhand government says that the state government will bear the expenses of all helicopters that are being used in rescue operations

 For the successful and safe conduct of matches during elections it is necessary that all the states are ready for this

 It is to be noted that some states had expressed their inability to hold the match along with the general election
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal apni sarkaar ke us vivaadaaspad paripatr ko lekar vipakshi dalon ke nishane par aa gaye hai, jisamen kisi bhi manahanikaarak samachar ke liye media ke khilaaf karrwai kii chetavanee di gai he
 Taking a dig at this, Congress and BJP accused him of being 'hypocritical' and 'undemocratic'
 congress netaa pisi chaako ne kaha, 'jab sarkaar kii aalochana ho rahi he, jab media unki sarkaar ke galat krityon ko ujagar kar rahi he to mukhyamantri us par aapatti jataa rahe hai
 This reflects the undemocratic attitude of the Chief Minister
 ' Expressing similar opinion, BJP said that while Kejriwal talks about freedom of expression, he wants to 'strangulate everyone'
 bijepi pravaktaa jiviel narsimha raav ne kaha, 'vah aniyantrit abhivyakti kii swatantraaa chaahate hai, lekin duusare sabhi kaa galaa ghontna chaahate hai
 This is the culmination of hypocrisy

 (padhein - dilli sarkaar kaa farmaan, aapattijanak tippanee hui to darj hoga manahani kaa maamla) On this circular, Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee President Ajay Maken said that it is 'strange' that Kejriwal is doing the opposite of what he used to say before the election
 unhone kaha ki aisa pehali baar nahin ho rahaa he
 Maken said, "as soon as his (kejriwal's) party came to power, he stopped the media's entry into the building (secretariat)
" unhen media se samasya nahin honi chahie thi, kyonki unki party unki madad se satta main ai
 Comments kejariwal kii aalochana karte hue congress netaa chaako ne kaha ki kai muddon par unka pardaafash ho rahaa he or aap sarkaar pehle hi din se sarkaar kii tarah kaam nahin kar rahi he, kyonki aantarik kalah ne iske kaamkaaj ko prabhavit kiya he
 He said, 'people in responsible positions should be patient enough to listen to the criticism and this also indicates that there is disturbances, corruption and lack of coordination in the government
 ' Congress leader PC Chacko said, 'when the government is being criticized, when the media is exposing the wrong acts of their government, the Chief Minister is objecting to it
 yah mukhyamantri ke aloktantric ravaiye ko darshata he
 ' isi tarah kii raay jaahir karte hue bijepi ne kaha ki jahaan kejariwal abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke bare main baat karte hai, vahiin vah 'sabakaa galaa ghontna' chaahate hai

 "according to the Chief Minister's press conference on December 7, 1984, Chief Minister Arjun Singh made the decision (to release Anderson) and informed the Central Government," Nehru told PTI
 vahi prabharee the or unhone hi nirnay kiya
 He said that it was only from the press conference of Arjun Singh in 1984 that the true statement about the incident could be revealed and that "it is wrong to question Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's intention as the decision was taken by the Chief Minister
" ‚Äô‚Äô unhone kaha ki bevajaah nayaa vivaad paidaa kiya ja rahaa he jab tathy pataa hai or singh ne 1984 main maamle par bolaa tha

 "arun Nehru said," He took the decision in view of the actual conditions at that time and now the decision is being questioned after 25 years
 ‚Äô‚Äô purv mantri ne kaha ki jab is tarah kii koi traasadee hoti he to kisi mukhyamantri kii praathamikta raahat or punarvaas hona chahie

 agar koi durghatana aaj hoti he to kya hamen 25 varsh baad jagana chahie
 When asked if the issue ever arose in the Central Cabinet meeting, Nehru said it was election time and not the time of the cabinet meeting as the leaders were busy campaigning
 unhone congress par is mudde ke liye ‚Äò‚Äòsurakshatmak‚Äô‚Äô ruukh apnaane kii aalochana kii or kaha ki maamla aisa nahin hona chahie tha kyonki maamle ke tathy maaloom hai or arjuna ne swayan hi 1984 main is bare main vaktavy diya tha

 Parrikar said, 'after the Pathankot attack, the Defense Ministry had set up a committee, which prepared all the departments related to defense

 50 paise kaa postcard par!!!' bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi, who has faced serious allegations of communalism, said on Patel Jayanti on Thursday that the country needs the secularism of Sardar Patel and not the secularism of the vote bank
 vah gujarat ke bharuch main 'stachu of unity' ke shilanyas kaarykram main bol rahe the
 The proposed Sardar Patel statue will be the tallest statue in the world
 isaki oonchai 182 meter hogi or iskaa cheharaa narmada baandh kii ore hoga
 It will be twice the height of America's famous 'statue of Liberty'
 2500 karod ke kharch vaali is yojana ko modi ne badi chaalaaki se pradesh ke vikaas, aakarshan, desh ke gaurav or patel ke sapane se joda
 He said in the indications that this statue of Sardar Patel can give India a place like China by its developed city Shanghai or by bullet train to Japan
 unhone jor dekar kaha ki bharat ko ab halke main lene ke din ab lad gaye hai
 Read his speech as it is
 bhaaiyon-bahanonnarmada ke tat par aaj nae itihaas or nae sankalp kaa shilanyas ho rahaa he
 i had cherished this dream for many years
 kai logon ne is sapane main rang bhare the, suzav die the
 This plan conception took place after several nominations
 anek logon kaa maargdarshan, prerana, aashirwad mila
 i congratulate them all
 yah ham sabakaa sapana he
 Narmada district is a small district, many decisions have been taken at the administrative level for its development and in the coming days it should be done with ease and function
 lekin sabakaa moolyankan karne ke baad sarkaar ko laga ki acha hoga ki is kaam ko gati dene ke liye yahaan ek chote se taluka (kasbaa) kaa nirmaan ho
 i received many suggestions on the issue of water
 adivasee bhaaiyon kaa puraa adhikaar he, pani unako milegaa
 Farmers will also get water
 hamane technical solution khoja he
 Left bank of Narmada will also get the benefit of irrigation, work will also be done for this
 narmada nadi par sardaar sarovar baandh or iske jariye gujarat-rajasthan main pani pahunchane kaa prayaas sardaar patel kaa sapana tha
 At some time, the society used to watch the people keeping water outside for home for thirst
 hamaare yahaan, khaas taur se gujarat-rajasthan main pani kaa mulya he, kyonki hamane pani kii tangi jheli he
 Even today, the maximum budget of the Gujarat government is given for water works
 sardaar sarovar baandh pariyojna ke liye pichhali sarkaron ne jitna kharch kiya, usase dabl kharch hamaari sarkaar ne pichley das saalon main kiya
 But Sardar Patel dreamed of all this work
 yah unheen ke sapane par sara kaam ho rahaa he
 If we could not arrange water, then where would we have known us
 gujarat main negative growth thi, log chhodkar ja rahe the
 Today, if you meet any person from Rajasthan, then you say that you did a very good job, which gave us water
 is sabake liye sardaar patel jimmedaar hai
 There is still so much burden of slavery, even after so many years of independence
 ham gulaami kii chaaya se ab tak nikal nahin paae hai
 And we have to do something like this to break the shadow of this slavery to get out of the shadow of slavery
 jiske kaaran ham garv ke saath atmasamman ke saath duniya ke saamne khadey hon
 Today i remind you 15-17 saal pehle hindustan main jab bajet pesh kiya jaataa tha, to use shaam ko paanch baje parliament main rakhaa jaataa tha
 It used to happen even fifty years after independence
 kisi ne sochaa ye kyon aisa tha
 This was because it was a tradition since the British era
 jab hamaare yahaan shaam ke paanch bajte the, tab britain main 11 bajte the or us samay unke yahaan sansad kaa kaam shuru hota tha
 When Vajpayee became the Prime Minister, this tradition was broken and the budget started to be kept at 11 am
 hamaari soch main pataa bhi nahin chalata he ki gulaami kis kadar daboch rahi he
 Friends, there is a need to stand with a self-respect in front of this thinking
 bharat ko hin bhav se dekhe jane kii aadat si ho gai he
 Come from India, let's go aside
 jab vaajapeyi ji ne shashan main aane ke kuch hi samay baad parmaanu bam visphot kiya, to puri duniya ne loha mana
 The world now hears the name of India, then says, yes there is something
 mitron duniya ke andar hamaare desh kaa koi naagarik kyon na ho
 Why should there be any tradition? aaj ke yug main samay kii maang kii
 Even after the independence of India, if other countries are seen with pride, then why not see our India, who used to see China in the past
 china ne ek shanghai bana diya
 Presented to the world
 logon kii china kii taraf sochane kii aadat badal gai
 The one which became the new China over the old, was built around Shanghai
 japan ne jab badi speed kii bullate train banaai to duniya ne kaha, are bhai kuch to he
 America spent billions of dollars sent to the moon, the world considered iron
 hamaara bhi ek global pojishning karnaa chahie
 The country of one and a quarter should emerge as a force
 anek maarg ho sakate hai
 Multiple action reactions can occur
 aaj ye sardaar patel kaa smarak sirf
 
 
 Sardar Sarovar became a dam, Sardar Saheb's dream came true
 wo hamaare gujarat ke the
 But this dream is very big
 ye bhavy smarak
 The height of which will force one to look like India
 itane bade raaje rajavaadon ko ek karne kaa kaam
 Expose the devious diplomacy of the British, we want to present the power of India to the world
 agar itihaas kii dharohar dekhen to chanakya ke baad is desh ko ek karne kaa kaam kisi ne kiya, to vah hai sardaar patel
 Shall we honor Rana Pratap? ham chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kaa sammaan karenge
 We will honor Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Rajguru
 kya wo bijepi ke member the kya
 Will he be respected in the country, who is a member of BJP
 dal se bada desh hota he
 And the one who dies for the country is the highest for us
 or isiilie sardaar sahab ko kisi dal ke saath jodna unka apmaan he
 That party is part of their history
 isse narendra modi bhi inkaar nahin kar saktaa
 We should never share the legacy
 hamaari viraasaten sanjhi hoti hai
 But after independence, Gandhiji continued to fight against untouchability all his life
 magar ye jo nai raajnneetik chuaachhut bad gai he
 We should also destroy it
 mitron mujhe do din purv piem se milane kaa avasar mila
 He said one thing very well
 main aabhaar vyakt karata hum
 Friends of the media did not understand
 baat ulti taraf chali
 Maybe their livelihood was in demand for bread
 piem ne kaha ki sardaar sahab sachche secular the
 We also say that the country needs a secularism with Sardar Saheb
 vot bank vaala nahin
 And therefore Prime Minister, this country needs the secularism of Sardar Saheb
 bharat ek hua
 Raje Rajawada did not belong to any one sect or society
 sab alag alag paramparaon se the
 So friends, i congratulate the Prime Minister of India
 aagrah karata hum
 All of us together should carry forward the secularism of Sardar Saheb, why some people will have such a big memorial
 baba sahib ambedkar, unke kai smarak hai
 But one has to believe that he is a form of God for the downtrodden society
 or jo bhi peedit daliton ke liye bhala chaahate hai, unhen baba sahib ambedkar ko prerana milti he
 Then it is not asked which party he was from
 unka jivan hamen prerana detaa he
 This is a common heritage, we should all be proud of
 ham sabakaa dil desh ke liye hona chahie
 The new generation will know how the iron men came to be
 wo koun si shakti thi unke andar
 We want to build a memorial of Sardar Saheb and once again bring the mantra of unity to every corner of India
 ham is baat se bhalee bhaanti parichit hai
 That India's progress cannot happen without peace, unity and harmony
 maa ke doodh main kabhi daraar nahin ho sakati
 The quarrels of regionalism, the quarrels of linguism, the quarrels of casteism and the high
 in chizon ne hamaare desh ko tabah kar diya
 a politician from any party may have filled the bag, but the pride of my Mother India has diminished
 agar hamen wo gaurav phir se hasil karnaa he, to ekta ke mantra ko ghar ghaki tak pahunchaana hoga
 Through this memorial commemorating Sardar Saheb's dreams, his voice which was captured for many years
 use buland karke
 Many people must have heard the voice of Sardar Saheb for the first time
 rongte khadey ho gayen
 Feeling comes in the mind
 hamane sabase pehle mahatma mandir banaaya
 It is interesting when we built this temple
 kaam abhi bhi chal rahaa he
 But at that time someone challenged us that Modi you are BJP, Gandhi was not in BJP
 to kyon bana rahe ho
 But when it comes to Sardar Saheb, why are there problems
 mitron aaj gujarat garv mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Sardar Saheb used to be nowhere in the Government Aid which used to come on October 31
 aaj aisa nahin he
 This is the Gujarat effect
 hamaare mahapurushon ko bhula kaise diya ja saktaa he
 Even if someone has criticized us, worshiping his great works is the work of the next generation
 hamaari koshish he ki hindustan kii aane vaali peedi itihaas ko jie or jane ye hamaara prayaas he
 If a society forgets its history and gets shattered by the grassroots of its history, then no matter how big the tree uprooted from the original is
 vaise hi samaaj kii dhara suukh jaati he, itihaas se usko takat or prerana milti he
 Seek the way
 hamaare desh ke liye agar samaaj ke man main aavashyaktaa he
 So the history of our society should be understood
 ye sardaar sahab kii pratimaa ke madhyam se ham aane vaali peedi ko wo najarana dena chaahate hai
 Brothers and sisters, how will this idol be made? isamen ham duniya bhar ke export lagaayenge
 Not a small job
 kitni dhaatuon ko milanaa hoga
 Let me tell you that the idol will be such that it will be safe for centuries
 is kaam ko ham hindustan kii ekta ke liye jodna chaahate hai
 Therefore, withdraw money from the vault and become an idol
 ye nahin chaahate
 People want to add people
 kyonki sardaar sahab ne ekta kaa kaam kiya tha, vahi sardaar sahab kaa sandesh ban jaae, isliye har gaanv ko jodna chaahate hai
 We are asking for something from them
 kya maang rahe hai
 Some people used dirty words
 unke dimag main gandagi he
 The farmer has a sword cannon in his house, even though he loves someone more then he does the tools of farming
 uske liye vah sabase zyada moolyawaan hota he
 Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was a farmer, an iron man
 sardaar patel ne ekta kaa kaam kiya tha
 Therefore, every corner of India has to be connected
 vah kisaan the, isliye kisaan ko jodna he
 He was an iron man, so iron has to be sought
 hamane har gaanv panchayat se prarthana kii he
 That the farmer has used the tool inside the field
 wo aujaar jo bharat maa kii god main khelaa he
 Who has suffered with Mother India to fill the stomach of the poor
 mujhe top nahin chahie
 I'd like a sword
 mujhe to mere kisaan ne khet main jo aujaar istemaal kiya he, uskaa tukdaa chahie
 Will melt it
 achche se acha steel nikaalenge
 That iron extract will find a place in that statue, then every citizen of India will say, My village is also in it
 ham gaanv ke mukhiya ke tasviir lenge, gaanv kaa chota sa itihaas lenge
 The entire memorial will be built, there will be a virtual world, in which there will be a picture of seven lakh villages in India, there will be a story, if someone comes after fifty years, then they will see the history of their village
 ye pavitra kaam ham karenge
 Today, travelers come to see the Taj Mahal in the country
 america main stechu of liberty dekhne ke liye yatri jaaenge
 We want it to be a great center for the whole world
 hamaari oonchai ko dekhe
 Measure the height of this country
 or jab ye puraa smarak banegaa
 It will be a pilgrimage of inspiration for us countrymen
 vishwa bhar ke liye pravaasana kaa dham ban jayega
 Everyone will get what they want for themselves
 is smarak main bharat ke bhavishya ko hamane joda he
 Whatever the government has done for the welfare of tribals in the country
 un sabko ham sangrahit karnaa chaahate hai
 How did new tribal zeal come into my tribal siblings' lives, and how do they become prosperous
 aguva kaise bane
 His research work should also be done under this memorial
 ye desh gaanv kaa desh he
 Patel was the son of a farmer
 kisaan ke kalyaan ke liye koun se nae vigyaan kii jarurat he, gaanv aadhuniktaa kii taraf kaise bade
 How should farmers pursue the path of modernity
 ye unako shiksha diksha kaise mili, agriculture ke liye
 For the village poor farmer
 ye kaam bhi ham isse jodna chaahate hai
 Friends have called the best companies in the world to do this work
 teen saal pehle us kalpana ko saamne rakhaa
 Experts came to make him come true
 teen saal uske pahaluon kii baariki main lage
 Then we are taking it forward
 jab hamane pehali baar kaha tha is kaam kaa
 i was gifted with silver by the people of Kutch
 maine poocha, bhai abhi itani jaldi kyon de rahe ho
 Right now a plan is being made
 tab kuccha ke logon ne jawaab diya
 Modi, if Sardar Saheb had not been there, he would not have dreamed of this dam, then water would not have reached our Kutch, we owe it to him
 mumbai gaya
 Weighed with silver there, it will also be used in it
 hamen hindustan ke jan jan ko jodna he
 The power of governance, the power of the people and the government of India is to be added
 dharti bhale gujarat kii ho, sapana hindustan kaa he
 We have been saying for many years that the work of Sardar Sarovar Dam should be completed
 magar kuch log hai, jo bayaan nahin dete, pet main roti nahin jate
 Some friends have spread the contract to end Modi
 pataa nahin kya kya gandh failaate rahete hai
 i know that the pm's team listens every word, the team of their boss listens
 isliye main kahana chahta hum, sardaar sarovar dam main bas get lagaana baaki he
 The rest of the work is done
 get ke baad hi sabase zyada pani bharegaa
 Met PM several times
 kaha, teen saal lagenge
 Do not let it stop, if you stand, the PM said that the matter is for you to understand
 ek saal baad mila, to bole ki are abhi tak nahin hua
 If you meet again, same thing

 Congress may be in Maharashtra and our government in the other two

 On the banks of this Narmada, the voice of the animals of Gujarat, of the poor, of farmers, of trees and plants will reach the Prime Minister of the country

 supreme court ne guuruuvaar ko desh kii sadakon kii haalat par gambhir tippanee karte hue kaha ki agar sadak kharaab he to log kis baat kaa toll tex den
 The court said that if the roads are bad then it is because of the policies of the government and in such a situation the government should make up for it
 court ne apane aadesh main logon ko raahat dete hue chhattisgarh main NH-6 kaa toll 20 fisadi gata diya he
 It is worth noting that earlier the Central Government had issued a notification to increase the toll on National Highway-6 by 40%
 court necendre ko is haive kii marammat karne ke bhi aadesh die hai
 NH 6 in Raipur, Chhattisgarh is in a dilapidated condition
 ise nayaa naam NH 53 diya gaya he
 The company, which maintains this highway and collects the toll, filed a petition in the Supreme Court
 jaanch ke liye banaai gai kamity ne apni report main kaha ki haive par kareeb 25 kilometre ke kshetra main sadak kii haalat bahut buree he
 It needs to be repaired

 Now a solid strategy has to be devised to control them
 court ne kaha, 'kyon naa haive par hi vajan karne vaale brij banaae jaaen or overloded trakon par kadi karrwai ho
 The Supreme Court said that the biggest problem is the enforcement of the law
 bench kii agavaai kar rahe justise ties thakur ne kaha ki sadakon par trek 20 ton se zyada vajan lekar chalate hai, lekin un par koi karrwai nahin hoti he
 Now the court will decide any mechanism
 justise thakur ne kaha ki manali ke raste main khud unhone cement factory kii trakon ko dekha he, jinpar overlod kii vajah se sadaken nahin bachi hai
 The court has also included two other petitions in the case

 ) Article 370 has a name in everyone's tongue in Kashmir case today
 ise khatm karne kii baat par mili juli pratikriyaayein bhi aa rahi hai
 Can this clause be legal or is it permanent? jaane, is bare main kya kah rahe hai samvidhan visheshgy
 1
 Article 370 or Article 35A ko lekar samvidhan visheshgyon kii apni raay he
 Constitution expert Subhash Kashyap aajtak
 in se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki isamen koi do raay nahin he ki bhartiya samvidhan kaa anuchhed 370 puri asthaayee he
 This thing is mentioned in the article itself
 2
 As far as the removal of Article 370 is concerned, two things have gone into the Constitution regarding this
 pehali baat ye he ki anuchhed 370 ko jammu kashmir vidhansabha kii sahmati se sansad hataa sakati he, jabaki doosraa praavdhaan he ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 368 ke tahat sansad do tihaai bahumat se isko samaapt kar sakati he
 3
 subhash kashyap kaa kahana he ki anuchhed 368 sansad ko samvidhan ke kisi bhi anuchhed main sanshodhan karne yaa usko hataane kaa adhikaar detii he
 This only solves many clues about Article 370
 4
 Constitution expert DK Dubey aajtak
 in se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki anuchhed 370 jammu kashmir rajya ke liye vishesh upbandh nahin karata he balki ye rajya ke liye asthaayee upbandh karata he
 The Indian Parliament can end this article with a two-thirds majority
 LIVE: modi sarkaar ne 370 main jammu-kashmir ko mili visheshadhikaar khatm kiye, raashtrapati kii manjuuri5
 Ambedkar was not in favor of Article 370: DK Dubey says that Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar was not in favor of Article 370 in Indian Constitution
 lihaaja is anuchhed ko samvidhan main jodne kaa prastaav shaikh abdulla ne rakhaa tha or yah anuchhed maamuli charchaa ke baad samvidhan main jod diya gaya
 6
 is Article ko lekar sansad main gambhirtha se charchaa bhi nahin kii gai thi
 DK Dubey says that Ambedkar had said that he is not happy about the policy of Jammu and Kashmir
 7
 Constitution expert Dubey says that Article 35A of the Indian Constitution was added through the Presidential Order
 jab is presidential order ko jari kiya gaya us samay pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru the or raashtrapati dow rajendra prasad the
 Article 35A is the real root cause of Kashmir Jammu and Kashmir problem
 presidential order ke dwaara isko samaapt bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 8
 bhartiya samvidhan ke Article 370 main jammu kashmir rajya ke liye asthaayee upbandh kiya gaya he
 The temporary provision, not the special provision, has been used for Jammu and Kashmir
 9
 Subsequently, Article 35A was added to the Constitution by issuing the Constitution (application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order 1954 under Article 370
 10
 In 2014, an NGO filed a petition in the Supreme Court, terming this article as a provision against the spirit of India and promoting separatism
 is yachika main anuchhed 35A or anuchhed 370 kii vaidhaniktaa ko chunauti di gai thi
 In this petition, it was argued that after independence, the Constituent Assembly was formed to make the constitution of the country, including 4 representatives of Jammu and Kashmir
 saath hi jammu-kashmir rajya ko kabhi bhi special status nahin diya gaya
 It was also argued that 35-A was a temporary provision which was added to stabilize the situation in the state at that time
 is anuchhed ko samvidhan ke nirmaataaon ne nahin banaaya

 After the controversy over the threat of crushing the electronic media, Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde retracted his claim that he meant social media and not journalists
 scindia ne kaha ki mere paas mere bhaashan kii recording he
 i meant violence against social media and students in the Northeast in Hyderabad and Karnataka

 The controversy arose from Shinde's statement on Sunday, accusing a section of it of unnecessarily vilifying the Congress by allegedly propagating it, while giving a ruse to crush the electronic media
 unki tippanee ke saath unke spashtikaran ko aaj samachar channelon ne prasaarit kiya he

 If it does not stop, we will crush such elements in the electronic media, who are engaged in the wrong kind of propaganda
 unhone kaha tha ki mere paas khufia vibhaag he
 i know who is doing such a thing
 main jaanata hum ki kya ho rahaa he
 Some forces are behind this

 How many murderers have been killed in this world and will be even further, but now it is a murder that took place in the capital city of Delhi, in which the murderers made a small injection giving life a weapon to kill
 qaatilon ne pehle zehar kaa intazaam kiya, use injection main bharaa or phir ek bheed bhare bazaar main wo injection apane shikaar kii gardan par laga diya
 The attack on the neck is dated 7 January
 jagah thi dilli kaa sadar bazaar
 About 7 in the evening
 30 baje kotak mahindra bank kaa ek noujvaan kaisier ravi kumaar rose kii tarah bank se apana kaam-kaaj nipta kar dwarka apane ghar ke liye niklaa tha
 He was walking out of his office and walking towards his house on foot
 shaam dhal chuki thi or use dilli ke is chor se bilkul duusare chor par janaa tha
 He also had some friends with him
 lekin tabhi kuch aisa hua, jisane uske munh se cheekh nikaal di
 The captured attacker felt as if someone had attacked his neck from behind
 baat bilkul sahi thi
 Something similar happened with Ravi
 jis tarah se us par peeche se hamalaa kiya gaya, use dekh kar aisa lag rahaa tha ki hamalavar use nishaanaa banane ke liye pehle se vahaan ghaat laga kar baitha tha
 The attacker was caught by the mob
 usne ravi par ek sui se hamalaa kiya tha
 Soon this matter reached the police
 lekin udhar, aspataal main ravi kii haalat lagaataar bighad rahi thi
 The use of poison injection injected a needle into the neck and smashed him in a single stroke
 doctoron ne lakh koshish kii
 But twenty-four hours passed, it was what it should not be
 ravi kii jaan chali gai
 Yes, Ravi was killed by a needle stab
 lekin sawaal ye tha ki akhir us anjaan shaks ne ravi kii jaan kyon lee? uski ravi se kya dushmani thi? akhir injection main aisa kya tha, jo ravi ke liye jaanaleva sabit hua? or sabase ahm ye ki usne ravi ko maarane ke liye itnaa ajeebogarib tareeqa kyon chunaa? to in tamaam sawaalon ke jawaab jaanane ke liye uske qaatil kaa munh khulwaanaa sabase zyaada zaruri tha
 The big conspiracy behind the murder first tried to confuse the uniformed men
 lekin jab usne sachai bataanaa shuru kiya, to police vaale bhi hairaan rah gaye
 Because the truth was that he had no direct enmity with Ravi
 haa, itnaa zarur tha ki mauka-e-vaardaat se injection ke saath pakadaa gaya prem singh naam kaa wo hamalavar, ravi ke sasuraal ke pados main rahata tha
 He told in interrogation that behind Ravi's murder, he is not actually someone else but someone else
 teen lakh kii supaariropee prem singh police ko bataaya ki usne to sirf is vaardaat ko anjaam diya he
 And in return he has to get three lakh rupees
 yani ravi kaa qatl supaari lekar kiya gaya tha
 And when the killer took the name of the plotter, everyone was once again shocked
 jaanate hai kyon? kyonki ravi kaa is shaks se bhi sidhe taur par koi lenaa-dena nahin tha
 Rather, he did not even know the mastermind of his murder
 lekin ravi kaa qatl jis vajah se hua, vaisaa kam hi dekhne ko miltaa he
 Neither Ravi knew the one who took his life
 or naa hi qatl kii saazish rachane vaale shaks ko, lekin iske baavjood wo naa sirf bemaut maaraa gaya
 Rather, the murderers found such a strange way of killing, whose example is not found in the whole world more than aces
 gym trainer ne rachi thi maut kii sajishkotak mahindra bank ke karmchaaree ravi kumaar kii jaan ja chuki thi
 He was stabbed in the neck on a beach road
 or injection bhi aisa-vaisaa nahin balki kai alag-alag tarah kii dawaaon ke zahreele cocktail kaa
 But as strange as this method of murder was, the intrigue behind it is even more shocking than that
 is murder kaa master mind tha ek gym trainer anish yadav
 The main accused turned out to be the old lover of the deceased's wife, Anish Yadav, a resident of Dwarka area of delhi, was the old lover of Maktool Ravi Kumar's wife
 donon college main saath hi padhate the or yaheen se anish us ladki ke peeche padaa tha
 Later, both of them got married in different places
 lekin anish in dinon apni apni bivi se alag rah rahaa tha
 In the meantime, the mind of his old love regained his mind
 or bas, isi fitur ke chalate usne apni mashooqa ke pati ravi ko raste se hataane kaa faisla kar liya
 But for this, he created such a frightening and peculiar intrigue, as is not usually seen
 katl ke liye churaai thim jahrili davaaenpahale to usne pakade jane se bachane ke liye qatl kaa ek phulpruf tareeqa dhundha
 Internet poisoning and injection of poisoning decided to kill their victims
 lekin ye kaam wo khud nahin karnaa chahta tha
 For this he persuaded Prem Singh, a physiotherapist living in his neighborhood of Mashuka
 baat teen lakh rupee main tay hui
 With the help of a physiotherapist, Aneesh discovers some drugs whose cocktail can prove fatal to human life
 ab unhen aisi dawaaon kii talash thi, kyonki ye aasaani se medical story main nahin milti
 Meanwhile, a chance came when a policeman, known to Aneesh, tried to commit suicide
 pulisavaale ko ames main bhartee karavaaya gaya or vahiin timaardaar ke taur par pahunche anish ne kuch behoshee kii dawaaen chura leen
 Photographs of the murderers captured on CCTV, DCP Jatin Narwal said that before the murder, both of them also bought a mask for love from a shop, but before this purchase, both left their mobile phones in the house to confuse the police
 ye or baat rahi ki donon kii tasviren dukaan ke sisitivi camere main qaid ho gai
 According to the plot, Prem had to run away with an injection in the neck of his victim Ravi
 anish ne use yahaan tak kah rakhaa tha ki agar wo pakadaa bhi jaae, to bhi bhul kar uskaa naam naa le or badale main wo use kanoonee taur cese se bachane main madad karegaa
 But by coincidence, Prem, who was injected by chance, was caught on the spot and broke into police interrogation
 or isi ke saath qatl kii puri saazish saamne aa gai
 Many cases are already registered on Aneesh Yadav, on the trail of the killer Prem Singh, who was caught by chance, when the police arrested Aneesh in the charge of conspiracy, many more things came to know
 ye saafe hua ki anish pehle bhi gangrape ke ek maamle kaa mulzim rah chukaa he
 In 2010, a gang rape case was registered against him in Dwarka area
 or in dinon wo zamaanat par baahar tha
 On the other hand, his wife was also sued for dowry against him
 lekin itnaa sabakuch hone ke baavjood uske hosh thikaane nahin aae or usne sirf apni sanak or ekatarfa aashiqui ke chalate ek begunaah kii jaan le lee

 Inaugurating his address in Bhojpuri in Varanasi townhall, he said that he had not been able to meet the people of Kashi till now, yet people here gave him a lot of love
 piem ne kaha, 'main pehla insaan aisa tha jo yahaan chunaav lard rahaa tha lekin 2014 main chunaav ayog ne sabha nahin karne di
 Today when i was going to see Kaal Bhairav, i got out in an open jeep and got an opportunity to see people '
 unhone kaha ki narendra modi bhale hi pradhanmantri ho lekin vah bhartiya janata party kaa ek kaaryakarta bhi he
 Addressing the people, PM Modi said that i was also selected by the people of Kashi and the people of Vadodara, i made Kashi a work area because how Shano Shaukat of the oldest city in this history came back
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne shanivaar ko prasiddh kaashi vishwanath mandir or kaal bhairav mandir main puja archana kii, saath hi hindutv vichaarak pandit madan mohan malviya kii pratimaa par pushpanjali arpit kii
 In an attempt to mobilize voters in favor of the BJP in this city of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Modi roadshowed the streets of Varanasi, in which people thronged
 pradhanmantri modi kaa rodsho banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay se shuru hua jahaan unhone hindutv vichaarak pandit madan mohan malviya kii pratimaa par pushpanjali arpit kii, rodsho main logon kii baari bheed dekhi gai
 Varanasi region has 80 percent Hindu population and once again BJP seems to be largely dependent on Modi for good performance in Uttar Pradesh assembly elections
 uttar pradesh main bhaajapa 15 varshon se satta se baahar he
 The BJP believes that this one-hour roadshow will benefit 40 seats in the last phase of elections on March 8, which was broadcast live by most regional channels
 road sho ke dauraan pradhanmantri kii jhalak paane ke liye logon kaa hujum banaras kii sadakon par umad padaa
 People were chanting many types of slogans including 'dawn Benaras, Sham Banaras: Modi Tere Naam Banaras', Modi, Modi
 pradhanmantri haath uthaakar or haath jodakar logon ko abhivadan kar rahe the
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier done a road show in Varanasi during the campaigning for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the seat from which he is an MP
 bhaajapa ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jabardast jeet hasil kii thi or apana dal ke saath bhaajapa gathbandhan ko 80 main se 73 siton par jeet hasil hui thi
 Three years later, the BJP once again appears to be heavily dependent on Modi for good performance in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 jonpur main piem ke nishaan par sapa-congressjonpur main sabha ko sambodhit karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne sapa-congress par 'gayatri prajapati mantra' japane or bhaajapa virdohi dalon par 'khud kaa saath, khud kaa vikaas' karne kaa aarope lagaate hue janata se uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main sapa, congress or basapa kaa ‚Äòpindadaan‚Äô karne kii apil kii
 Modi said at the election rally held here that in our country it is custom to recite Gayatri Mantra for doing good work but sp-congress alliance is chanting 'gayatri Prajapati Mantra'
 mukhyamantri balaatkaar ke aaropee gayatri prajapati ke liye chunaav sabha main vot maangate hai
 Prajapati stays there and now he is not looking for the police
 ek beti nyaay maang rahi he or mukhyamantri ji gunahagaar kii raksha kar rahe hai
 He said that if any buffalo is lost in Uttar Pradesh, the government runs but one daughter is craving for justice and your police and chief minister are sleeping
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki ek taraf bhaajapa kaa mantra he 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas' lekin kuch rajanetaaon or sarkaron kaa mantra he 'khud kaa saath, khud kaa hi vikaas'
 When we talk about the development of everyone, we are called wrong, people who 'develop themselves, develop themselves' are called non-communal
 unhone kaha ki aap logon ko agali aath march ko aakhri daur main matdaan karnaa he
 You have got the privilege of donating pind daan, those who have committed the sin of destroying Uttar Pradesh, you have to 'pindadan' by pressing the finger on lotus sign, your party's mark, on the mark of Bhaspa
 sapa, congress, basapa se mukti hi vikaas kaa darwaja kholegi
 Modi said that today the sixth phase of the election is going on, we have come to know that the people have given a majority to the BJP
 ab bonus kii baari he
 Get such a grand victory that no one can get a chance to change the fate of the state
 modi ne mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, 'akhilesh ji mujhase kah rahe the ki agar aap express-ve par jaaoge to aap bhi sapa ko vot de doge
 You do one thing aap cycle par apane naye yaar (congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi) ko baitaakar isi jonpur main khetasarai-khutahan maarg par cycle chalaakar dikhaa do, to aap bhi sapa ko vot nahin doge
 'he told the public,' Make a majority government of BJP in Uttar Pradesh, so that after five years, we will calculate
 varsh 2022 main jab aglaa chunaav hoga, tab aap mujhase hisaab mangiega, main hisaab de duungaa
 The Prime Minister once again raised the issue of electricity supply and asked, "tell the Jaunpur people whether you get 24-hour power, your Chief Minister says it is available
" chunaav main vah aapaki ankhon main dhul jhonk rahe hai ki nahin
 Will you trust such people? bharat sarkaar 24 ghante bijli dene ke liye paise de rahi he
 But they only need electricity in Saifai and not in Jaunpur
 ' unhone kanoon-vyavastha kaa bhi mudda uthaate hue kaha ki agar kanoon kaa raaj nahin hoga to yahaan puunji nivesh nahin hoga
 Due to this people will have to move to other states for employment, so law and order is the most important issue in UP
 modi ne kaha ki yahaan ke thane sapa ke daftar hai
 Prison here is not a jail but a palace for the musclemen
 agali 11 march ko bhaajapa or saathiyon kii sarkaar banane ke baad sachche arth main thane ko thana or jail ko jail banaaenge
 We will cure all the musclemen having fun in one day
 ve pulisavaalon ko bhi uthva lete hai, ve jameen or makaan hadap kar lete hai
 The Central Government enacted a law that those who have seized your property, they will not come out of jail before seven years

 While preparations are being made to hang him on September 12, Koli can then file a petition in the Supreme Court for reconsideration by staying the sentence
 gauratlab he ki mangalvaar ko hi supreme court kii samvidhan peeth ne ek aitihaasik faisla sunaate hue kaha tha ki faansee kii sajaa paane waalon kii punarvichaar yachika kii sunwaayee khuli adaalat main hogi or doshi ko apana paksh rakhane ke liye aadha ghante kaa vakt diya jayega
 The bench also said that those whose reconsideration petition has been rejected, they can file the petition again within a month
 supreme court 24 july ko deree ke aadhaar par coli kii punarvichaar yachika khaarij kar chukaa he
 That is, on the basis of this decision, Koli may get another chance to hear
 haalanki, usee din coli ne court main punarvichaar yachika ke faisle par roak lagaakar sunwaayee ko samvidhan peeth main bhejne kii apil kii thi lekin court ne use khaarij kar diya tha
 In fact, six convicts including Yakub Memon, convicted for hanging in the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts and Red Fort attack convict Arif, had filed an application in the Supreme Court demanding that the hearing on the reconsideration petition be held not in the chamber but in the open court and the convict Everyone should be allowed to have his side
 maamle ko paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth ko saunpa gaya or 2 sitambar ko isi par court ne ye faisla sunaaya
 However, the bench also said that those whose curative petition i
e
 remedial petition has also been rejected, will not get this opportunity
 is faisle se yaqub memon ko bhi phir court main punarvichaar yachika daayar karne kaa mauka mil gaya he
 On this basis, Koli can approach the Supreme Court

 Probably retained until the next final
 piem modi kaa badhata graphloksabhaa chunaav main prachand bahumat vaali sarkaar banane ke baad se takreeban har chunaav main modi kaa ye magic badhata hi ja rahaa he

 The glory of this golden period of BJP is tied on the head of Prime Minister Modi

 aisa lagata he maano saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad se hi puraa desh rajya-dar rajya modi lahar se sarabor hota ja rahaa he
 This is nothing short of a miracle in democracy and politics, because the wave of anti-incumbency starts with power
 lekin modi ke jaadu ne siyasat ke is vyakaran ko bhi dhwast kar diya or sirf yahi vyakaran nahin, bade-bade diggajon ke anumaan ko palatate hue modi lahar ne notebandi ke asar ko bhi bemaani kar diya
 The demonetization decision shocked Modi Modi's historic decision
 vipaksh ne is faisle ko sarkaar ke khilaaf jamkar istemaal kiya
 Even big economists considered it a dangerous decision

 In fact, while commenting on the controversy after the photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was printed while spinning the spinning wheel on the calendar of Khadi village industry, the Haryana Health Minister had said that there is no patent for Khadi in the name of Mahatma Gandhi
 anil vij ne kaha ki mahatma gandhi kaa naam khaadi ke saath judane se khaadi dub gai thi
 According to Vij, PM Narendra Modi is a better 'brand name' than the father of the nation
 tippaniyan Ambala MLA Anil Vij had also said that since the day Mahatma Gandhi's photo was being placed on Indian rupee notes, the rupee's value has come down, and gradually from Indian rupee notes
 Bapu's picture will also be removed iske baad bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kii rajya sarkaar ke mukhiya manohar laal khatter tathaa party netaa shina ensi ne anil vij ke bayaan kii kadi ninda kii

 unhone kaha ki mahatma gandhi deshbhar ke adarsh hai, or unke kaaran desh kii mudra kaa avamulyan nahin hua

 The comments ambala se vidhayak anil vij ne yah bhi kaha tha ki jis din se bhartiya rupee ke noton par mahatma gandhi kii photo lagaai ja rahi he, us din se hi rupee kii keemat kam ho gai he, or dhire-dhire bhartiya rupee ke noton par se bhi baapu kii tasviir hataa di jaaegi After this, Manohar Lal Khattar, the head of the state government of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and party leader Shaina NC strongly condemned Anil Vij's statement
 khatter ne vij ke bayaan se kinaaraa karte hue kaha tha, yah unka vyaktigat haisiyat main diya gaya bayaan he, or is bayaan se party kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 He said that Mahatma Gandhi is the ideal of the country, and he did not devalue the country's currency
 khatter ne yah bhi kaha ki pradhanmantri ne charkha sirf khaadi ke prachaar ke liye chalaaya tha, or is pratik kaa arth baapu ko riples karnaa nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Ambala MLA Anil Vij also said that since the day the photograph of Mahatma Gandhi is being placed on Indian rupee notes , the rupee's value has come down, and gradually on Indian rupee notes

 Pratyush Maini and Rajesh Bansal got the second place in the ranking

 Among the girl students, Telangana's Ryali Gayatri has been ranked first and her All India ranking is 11
 tripalaiti, enaitior anya sansthaanon main bii or beatech paathyakramon main daakhile akhil bhartiya ranking ke aadhaar par hote hai
 This ranking is based on 60 percent JEE Main marks and 40 percent 12th marks marks
 aadhaar carboor isaki suraksha ko lekar kaaphi zyada chintaaen jataai ja rahi hai
 In such a situation, the Aadhaar Authority UIDAI is considering bringing such a strong system, under which your Aadhaar number will be safe
 sarkari agenciyon samet kahin bhi aapako apana aadhaar number nahin dena padegaa
 The idea of issuing a dummy number is in fact the Aadhaar Authority is considering bringing a system to issue a dummy number to every Aadhaar card holder
 is vyavastha ke tahat jahaan bhi aadhaar number kii jarurat hogi, vahaan dami number dena hoga
 With the help of this number, all the work related to Aadhaar can be done
 is tarah aadhaar number surakshit rahegaa
 Negotiations are underway Two senior officials from Economic Times talked about this new system
 unhone bataaya ki is vyavastha ko laane ko lekar yuadiai main ucch str par baat chal rahi he
 However, before implementing this system, it will be seen how large the dummy number can be used or how beneficial it will be to implement
 har baar janaret hoga nayaa dami numbepsdhikariyon ne kaha ki is vyavastha ke tahat har lenden or kaam ke liye har baar nayaa dami number janaret karne kii vyavastha kii ja sakati he
 For example, if you have to give an Aadhaar number in a government agency, you will be able to generate an Aadhaar dummy number for this
 yah aapke phone par van time password kii tarah aayega or ek istemaal ke baad yah niskriy ho jayega
 Aadhaar Detail will have to be tracked According to the officials, keeping a permanent number will not be beneficial in any way
 unhone kaha ki alag-alag dami number hone se aadhaar ditels ko trek karnaa kaaphi mushkil hoga
 This will greatly help in keeping the details of Aadhaar safe

 If India goes to war between Pakistan, then there is no such area of pakistan which is not on the target of India
 puraa hindustan 32 lakh varg kilometre main failaa he
 Whereas Pakistan is limited to only 7 lakh square kilometers
 zaahir he puure pakistan ko nishaanaa bananaa bharat se kahin zyada aasaan he
 India has deployed about 56 percent of its atomic bombs from ground to ground missiles
 jabaki baaki hawa or samandar main bhi bharat kii chaukasee he
 There is not a single area of pakistan that does not fall within the range of India's nuclear bomb
 bharat ke paas bhale hi pakistan se paanch-das kam parmaanu bam hai
 But there are enough bombs to destroy any city of Pakistan completely
 hindustan kaa kul kshetrafal 32 lakh varg kilometre se bhi zyaada he
 Whereas Pakistan only 7 lakh square kilometers
 yani hindustan ke rajasthan, madhya pradesh or maharashtra jaise teen rajyon ko mila diya jaae, to usase bhi kam
 Hindustan has deployed more than half of its nuclear weapons stockpile, 56% of its ground-to-surface ballistic missiles like Prithvi and Agni
 iske alaava ke-15 sagarika pandubbi main 12 parmaanu hathiyaar maujuud hai
 Hindustan has also prepared for a submarine named INS Arihant equipped with nuclear power
 aise main ye zamin se zamin or jal se zamin par maar karne vaali parmaanu missile aasaani se pakistan ke islamabad, rawalpindi, lahore, karachi samet pakistan ke faujee thikaanon ko nishaanaa bana sakati he
 According to experts, any nuclear attack on cities like Haroul and Karachi will not last only in these two cities
 balki iskaa asar aas-paas ke ilaaqon ke saath-saath khud hindustan or afghanistan ke kuch ilaaqon tak bhi ho saktaa he
 But this will decide on the trend of the wind
 hindustan ke paas dhai sau kilometre kii duuri tak maar karne vaale short range belistic mixilon kaa aisa zakhira bhi he, jo 24 parmaanu bam daag saktaa he
 It can easily liquefy Pakistan's Lahore, Sialkot, Islamabad Rawalpindi
 isi tarah agni 1 or agni 2 ke naam se parmaanu hathiyaaron se las 20 belistic missile bhi bharat ke paas hai, jo 7 sau se 2 hajaar kilometre kii duuri tak maar sakate hai
 In such a situation, almost all the cities of Pakistan can come in their JD
 phir chaahe wo lahore ho, islamabad ho, yaa phir rawalpindi, multan, peshawar, karachi, queta yaa guadar
 Long range missiles like Agni 3, 4 and 5 can also be the cause of destruction of Pakistan
 isi tarah hindustan ke paas jahaaj se dhanush naam ke small range ke parmaanu missile bhi maujuud hai
