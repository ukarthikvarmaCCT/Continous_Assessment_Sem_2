 a few days ago, on May 30, Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee launched Jai Bang Janani (JBJ) and Jai Hind Vahini (JHV) for women to help the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) among the people To combat access
 mamata ne apane bhaaiyon subrat (urf ganesh) or samir (urf karthik) ko jeechavi kaa kramash: adhyaksh or sanyojak niyukt kiya he
 These fronts, which appear non-political in their nature, will have ministers from the Mamta government who will work under them

 This has shaken Mamta
 bangla asmita par unke bahut zyada jor se is baat kii jhalak milti he ki 2021 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke liye ve apane bengali vot bank ko lekar kitni phikrmand hai
 The RSS has seized a large part of Mamta's Bangla vote bank in rural areas through its appeal of Hindu sentiment
 rabindra bharti vishvavidhyalay main raajnneeti vigyaan ke professor biswanath chakravarti kehete hai, ''rajya ke 4
 With the aim of uniting 2 crore Bengali-speaking Hindu votes, she is trying to bring out the all-bengali spirit (bengaliiyana)
 ''kalakatta uniwarsity ke purv professor sovon laal datta gupta kehete hai, '''jai shri ram' naare kaa muqabla karne ke liye 'jai bangla' naaraa lagaana is baat kaa saaf sanket he ki mamata bhaajapa ko hindipattee kii party ke taur par pesh karengi, jise na to bangla kii or na hi uske itihaas, uski samskruti, uski bhashaa, uske khan-paan yaa kapadon kii hi koi samaj he

 *** On February 1, the Modi government will present its final budget
 chunaav se sirf do maheene pehle aane vaala yah bajet antarim hoga
 That is, according to tradition, through this, the government will arrange for the expenditure for three months till elections form a new government
 parampara yah bhi he ki jaati hui sarkaar koi bada nitigat elaan is antarim bajet main nahin karti he
 But the question is arising whether the Modi government can make big announcements in view of the upcoming elections in this interim budget or vote on account keeping the tradition, so that voters can be wooed? There are some announcements that have been waiting for a long time
 sarkaar ke bheetar inhen lekar charchaa bhi he
 The biggest announcement in the budget is being made about the income tax payers
 kaha ja rahaa he ki antarim bajet main iskar chhot kii seemaa dhai lakh se badha kar paanch lakh rupye prati varsh kii ja sakati he
 Right now, people earning 2
5 lakh to 5 lakh have to pay 5% income tax
 yah charchaa bhi he ki vitt mantri arun jetali is bajet main pensionron ko chhot de sakate hai
 Also the income tax savings limit can also be increased
 ghar kharidne ke liye gaye karj ko lekar bhi iskar main kuch or riyaayat mil sakati he
 Significantly, the middle class has been waiting for all these reliefs for the last five years
 use lag rahaa he ki jate jate hi sahi, lekin modi sarkaar shaayad use raahat dekar apni vaapasi kaa intjaam kar le
 The second big issue is to give relief to the farmers
 teen rajyon main sarkaar ganvaane ke baad bijepi ko kisaanon kii naaraazgi kaa ehsaas hua he
 Prime Minister Modi has described loan waiver as insufficient
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki kisaanon ke liye kuch nae elaan yaa to antarim bajet main yaa usase pehle ho sakate hai
 This includes measures like lending at zero interest rate and not pledging anything for loans up to two lakh rupees
 ek vikalp telugana ke raiyat bandhu yaa odisha kii kaaliya yojana kii tarj par raahat dena he, jisamen chote or manjhaule kisaanon ko prati acre prati fasal ke hisaab se beej-khaad vagairah ke liye tayshuda rakam di jaati he
 Any major announcement is possible even for the unemployed
 lekin in tamaam sambhavnon ke bich sawaal he ki kya modi sarkaar vaaki khajaana khol paaegi? khud sarkaar ne hi vittiya ghate kaa lakshya 3
 3%
 jiesti main collection ummid se kam he
 Government companies were also not sold
 aise main is lakshya ko puraa karnaa chunauti he
 On one hand there is the challenge of maintaining the tradition and on the other, the goal of returning to power
 bijepi ke kai netaa kehane lage hai ki khajaana bharne se kya phayda agar koi duusari sarkaar aakar use lutaae
 It is better that you loot the treasure and then come to power
 vaise bataa duun ki chunavi saal main antarim bajet main lubhaavne elaan se pichhali sarkaar bachati rahi hai lekin kuch apwaad bhi hai
 In 2014, the then Finance Minister p Chidambaram did not make policy announcements, but cut taxes on some items

 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ko 2019 kaa semifinal mana ja rahaa he
 The Congress and BJP have given full strength to win the political bets of the state
 siddharmaiya ke sahare congress apni satta ko barkaraar rakhane kii jaddojahad kar rahi he, to vahiin bijepi bies yediurppa ke chehre ko aage karke dobaaraa se satta main vaapasi kii koshish main lagi he
 But the coincidence of the politics of Karnataka is telling a different story
 rajya main pichley 33 saalon main sattadhari party lagaataar dobaaraa satta main vaapasi nahin kar saki he
 Not only this, except in 2013, the ruling party at the center could never get majority in the state
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav kii siyaasi ranbhumi main congress or bijepi ke bich kaante kaa muqabla hota hua najar aa rahaa he
 Before 1972 it was known as Mysore State, but was renamed Karnataka
 karnataka ke chaar dashak ke siyaasi itihaas par najar daali jaae to 1983 or 1985 main lagaataar do baar janata party kii sarkaar bani thi
 Since then whenever the assembly elections have been held, the ruling party could not return to power for the second time in a row
 mysore se karnatakanam padane ke baad 1972 main paanchvaan vidhansabha chunaav or 1978 main hue chathe chunaav main congress jeet darj kar satta par aseen hui
 After the Emergency, in the seventh assembly election of the state in 1983, the Congress departed from power and formed the Janata Party government
 janata party ne 95 siten jeetin or ramakrishna hegade ne anya chote dalon ke saath mil kar rajya main pehali gaiyrcongressi sarkaar banaai
 However, this government could not last long
 iske baad 1985 ke chunaav main janata party ne 139 siton ke saath shandaar safalata hasil kii
 This was the same period when the Congress government led by Indira Gandhi was in power at the center
 iske baavjood karnataka main unka jaadu nahin chal sakaa or rajya kii satta main nahin aa saki
 The seventh assembly elections of Karnataka were held in 1989, the Janata Party farewell and the Congress returned to power with a landslide victory
 rajya ke itihaas main ab tak kii sabase zyada178 siten jeetne kaa recordbanaaya, jise koi dal abhi tak tod nahin sakaa
 After this, the Congress faced a crushing defeat in the 1994 assembly elections
 echdi devgauda ke netritv main janata dal ne 115 siten jitkar sarkaar banaai
 While at the center, the Congress government was led by PV Narasimha Rao
 paanch saal ke baad 1999 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke haathon janata dal ko karaari haar kaa samaanaa karnaa padaa
 The Congress returned to state power by winning 132 seats
 ye vahi samay tha, jab centre kii satta main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv main bijepi gathbandhan endie kii sarkaar thi
 The Congress was forced out of power in the 2006 assembly
 bijepi 79 siton ke saath sabase badi party banakar ubhari or congress ko 65 siten milin
 The Congress formed a government with the JDS which became the first coalition government in the state
 vahiin centre kii satta main congress gathbandhan kii sarkaar thi
 Subsequently, the JDS formed the government with the BJP and became Chief Minister Kumaraswamy
 2008 main karnataka vidhansabha chunaav hue jedies ko karaari haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 The BJP came to power with 110 seats and the CM was succeeded by BS Yeddyurappa
 dakshin bharat main pehali baar bijepi kii sarkaar bani thi
 In 2008, there was a Congress-led government at the Center
 iske baavjood congress mahaj 80 siton par simat gai
 After five years of assembly elections in 2013, the BJP had to face a crushing defeat
 jabaki congress 122 siton ke saath bahumat darj karke satta par virajman hui
 The Congress returned to power in Karnataka after 1999
 pichley teen dashakon main pehali baar rahaa ki centre kii satta main rahane vaali party kii rajya main sarkaar bani
 The politics of Karnataka will write a new text in 2018 or will repeat its old history
 rajya kii satta par congress kabiz he or centre kii satta par bijepi

 nancy powell ne videsh mantralay se aagrah kiya tha ki vahunhen protocol lounj dilaae, security muhaiyaa karaae or imigration memmadad kare
 But the Ministry of External Affairs refused and said that all these special features have now been taken away due to the misbehavior with Devyani Khobragade

 In the latest case, India has said that the day Devyani was arrested, she had diplomatic immunity
 us samay vah yuan ke saath bhi judi hui thim

 main bhi modi kii tarah gaanvon ke bare main achche se jaanata hum
 Paresh Rawal praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that he is also honest like former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri
 Life is unfair Dr Manmohan Singh got someone of the calibre of Anupam Kher
 Poor Modi ji has to settle for Vivek Oberoi
 Salman Khan hota toh kya maza aata
 - Omar Abdullah (@omarabdullah) January 8, 2019 Omar Abdullavivek Oberoi, who spoke on the casting of Vivek Oberoi, is getting mixed response after the first look of PM Modi
 darshakon ke saath-saath jammu-kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne bhi vivek kii casting par chutki lee he
 He wrote by tweeting- "how strange is life too
" doctor manmohan singh ke role ko yogya kalakaar ke rup main anupam kher mili
 Poor Modi ji had to compromise with Vivek Oberoi
 salmaan khan hota to kya majaa aata
 '' 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhartiya janata party ne narendra modi ke netritv main aitihaasik jeet darj karte hue centre main sarkaar banaai
 After this, saffron went on growing throughout the country
 haalanki, centre main aane se pehle bijepi kii sarkaar mahaj 7 rajyon main thi, jabaki us vakt desh kii satta par kabiz congress 13 rajyon main shashan kar rahi thi
 But as soon as Modi gets the throne, believe that the bad times of Congress have started
 chunaav-dar chunaav use karaari haar milti chali gai
 On the other hand, the soil that the BJP touched also became gold
 iskaa nateeja ye hua ki bijepi ek vakt main apane sahyogiyon ke saath milakar 20 rajyon main ek saath sarkaar chalaane ke record tak pahunch gai
 But now that the 2019 Lok Sabha is in front, the situation is slightly different
 2014 main satta milane ke vakt bijepi ke paas mahaj 7 rajya the
 It had a coalition government in 2 of these states
 rajasthan, gujarat, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or goa main bijepi kii apane dam par sarkaar chal rahi thi, jabaki punjab or andhra pradesh main vah gathbandhan kii sarkaar chalaa rahi thi
 The Congress, on the other hand, was ruling in 13 states
 himachal, uttarakhand, haryana, karnataka, arunachal pradesh, assam, meghalaya, manipur, mizoram, jharkhand, maharashtra, jammu kashmir or kerala main party apane dam par yaa gathbandhan main sarkaar chalaa rahi thi
 The BJP wave following the Modi government at the Center: After Narendra Modi became Prime Minister in 2014, the BJP formed governments in Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir on its own or with allies
 sikkim main usne apni madad se sarkaar banavaai
 In 2016, the BJP created history in Assam and ended 15 years of Congress rule
 iske baad 2017 main 7 rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav hue to bijepi ne upi, uttarakhand, goa, manipur, himachal pradesh or gujarat main sarkaar banaai, jabaki congress ne punjab main apana khaataa kholaa
 In the 2018 assembly elections, the BJP lost its major states as Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh and the Congress won here
 karnataka main congress or jedies ne sarkaar banaai
 Whereas in Left stronghold like Tripura, BJP managed to feed its lotus
 north east ke rajyon main bhi bijepi ne apane sahyog se kai sarkarein banavaain
 That is, till 2017, the Viji chariot of BJP continued without any hindrance, but when elections were held in Karnataka in early 2018, the Congress formed a government with JDS and worked to improve its graph
 iske baad halaat badalte chale gaye or 2018 ke ant main rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main congress ne bijepi kii satta ukhaad phenki
 The victory in these three states gave the Congress great power
 isi saal kii shuruyaat main usne jammu-kashmir main pidipi se apana samarthan waapas le liya, is tarah vahaan uski sarkaar chali gai
 Now the current situation is that the Congress has moved beyond the remarks made by PM Narendra Modi about the Congress's 'three-p' ie Punjab, Puducherry and Family Congress
 yani congress ab punjab or puducheri ke baad karnataka, chhattisgarh, rajasthan or madhya pradesh main bhi sarkaar banane main kaamyaab ho gai he
 That is, Congress is now running a government in five states and a union territory
 jabaki bijepi kaa graph neeche aayaa he
 At present, the BJP government is in 17 states, out of which some coalition governments are also running in it
 maujuuda halaat main bijepi apane dam par yaa sahyogiyon ke saath milakar arunachal pradesh, assam, bihar, goa, gujarat, haryana, himachal pradesh, jharkhand, maharashtra, manipur, meghalaya, mizoram, nagaland, sikkim, tripura, upi or uttarakhand main shashan main he
 However, this picture may change further till the results of Lok Sabha elections, because Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Odisha are going to have assembly elections along with Lok Sabha elections
 baharhaal jo maujuuda sthiti he usamen ab centre sarkaar par hi bijepi kii naiya paar lagane kii jimmedaari nahin he, balki bijepi shasit rajya sarkaron ke saamne bhi apni party ko ek baar phir centre kii satta main laane kaa bada target he
 At the same time, after getting the power of three states of the Hindi belt, Congress governments are also challenged to emerge from the party's bad position in the Lok Sabha elections
 soshal media par celebs ko trol karne kaa silsilaa in dinon aam ho chukaa he
 Recently a similar attempt was made with Junior Bachchan
 lekin unhone apni hazirajvaabi se troller kii bolti band kar di
 After all, the questions that were raised about her love of Aaradhya Bachchan and Aishwarya Parenting
 darasal, twitor par ek mahila ne abhishek bachchan ko tag karte hue unki beti ke skool jane ko lekar sawaal uthaaya
 At the same time, he called his wife Aishwarya Rai as arrogant
 short dress main thi aishwarya to photographer par kyon bhadke abhishek?yujar mahila ne twit kar likhaa, abhishek bachchan kya tumhaari beti skool nahin jaati? mai hairaan hum ki koun sa skool bachche ko mom ke saath trip par jane ke liye manjuuri detaa he
 Or do you want to make your daughter a beautiful woman with no mind
 hameshaa aradhya apni ghamandi mummy ke haathon main haath daale ghoomte hue dikhti he
 Aaradhya does not have a normal childhood
 Ma’am, as far as i know


 Most schools are shut for the week-end
 She goes to school on the weekdays
 Maybe you should try it considering you spelling in your tweet
 - Abhishek Bachchan (@juniorbachchan) December 4, 2017 Junior Bachchan, often protective about Aishwarya and Aaradhya, did not like the woman's comment at all
 unhone mahila ko munhtod jawaab dete hue likhaa, 'mam, jahaan tak main jaanata hum, zyaadaatar skool weekend par band rahete hai
 Aaradhya goes to school in the week days
 aapako bhi shaayad is twit main apni spellings ko dekhte hue aisa karnaa chahie
 Salman and Ash will be face to face in 2018, movies will be released on the same day, this funny answer of Abhishek in defense of Betty and wife is really worthy
 jahaan mahila ko uski baton kaa jawaab bhi mil gaya or vah nishane par bhi aa gai
 This is not the first time Abhishek has defended Aaradhya and Aishwarya
 kuch din pehle unhone aishwarya kii galat tareeke se tasviren lene vaale photographer ko aade haath liya tha

 You may have seen a man walking around a temple in the spirit of devotion, but never heard of a dog traveling around the temple in devotion
 ji haa lekin is baar ek kutta pichley teen dinon se ek mandir kaa chakkar laga rahaa he
 The case is of Mudagaon in Chhaura block in Rayupar
 jahaan ek kutta gaanv main sthit pracheen mandir ‘bajrang bali shrijanki mandir’ kaa pichley teen dinon se chakkar laga rahaa he
 The dog circling the temple remains a matter of curiosity for the villagers
 kute ke chakkar lagane kii khabar ke baad gaanvvaalon ne sochaa ki kutta mandir ke paas gum rahaa hoga, lekin jab vah lagaataar kai ghante tak mandir kii parikrama karne laga to log bhi ise aashcharyachakit hokar dekhne lage
 At the same time, crowds of people reached the temple after the news of orbiting continuously for several hours
 logon kii bheed ko dekhakar bhi kute kaa dhyaan nahin bhatka or vah niyamit parikrama karata rahaa
 But due to continuous walking, the dog fell ill and people started taking care of the dog
 gaanvvaalon ke mutabik kutta lagaataar parikrama karne laga, jiske chalate vah vah guuruuvaar ko kuch ghanton ke baad biimaar hokar baith gaya or uski aankh se aansu nikalne lage
 During this time, the villagers treated him by vet Dr
 devesh joshi se karavaaya
 Joshi drips to her
 is dauraan kutta phir uth khadaa hua or parikrama karne main jute gaya
 The dog is orbiting without taking food and water since Tuesday morning
 gaanv ke bujurg dhaniram ke mutabik vah kute ko mangalvaar se hi yahaan dekh rahe hai
 He is constantly circling without taking food and water
 dhaniram ne bataaya ki kutta ek parikrama puri kar mandir ke mukhya dwaar par bhagwaan ke saamne mattha tekta he
 He told that the villagers are arguing that the dog must have got some kind of curse in the previous life, due to which he is constantly circling to get rid of the curse

 Shah's visit was part of a state visit to decide the electoral strategy ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 madhya pradesh sareekhe suubon main apni pakad kaayam rakhana bhagava gemplan ke liye behad ahm he
 The state also has assembly elections in 2018
 bhopal main teen dinon ke dauraan vibhinn baithkon main bhaajapa pramukh ne mantriyon or party padaadhikariyon ko cheta diya tha ki baatcheet kaa koi bhi byoraa press ko katai na bataaen
 Nevertheless, local newspapers published reports issuing ultimatums and warnings to ministers doing poorly
 baad main media se baat karte hue shah ne in reporton ko atkal kahkar khaarij kar diya
 However, he did confirm the 'command to remain silent' and said that it was 'necessary for discipline'
 shah ne pradesh main sambhavit netritv parivartan kii afvaahon ko bhi khaarij kiya
 He said that Chauhan will be the face of the party in the elections next year
 dilachasp yah he ki unhone aisa vaada pradesh adhyaksh nandkumar singh chouhan ke bane rahane ke bare main nahin kiya
 Shah's relationships with the chief minister are often seen as 'heartless' relationships, especially after the embarrassment of the Vyapam scandal and the agitation of the peasant movement
 iske baavjood unhone chouhan kii tarif ke pul baandhe or madhya pradesh ko bimaaru (pichde) rajyon ke darje se baahar laane ke liye unki peeth thapthapai
 He also declined to comment on the possibility of expansion of the cabinet in Madhya Pradesh before the assembly elections
 unhone kaha ki mantrimandal main khaali chah jagahon ko bharna mukhyamantri chouhan kaa visheshadhikaar he
 This is important because it was believed that through the meetings of the states, Shah is also looking for the capable faces of the leadership
 sthaneey netaaon ke saath baithkon main shah ne rajya kii sabhi 29 loksabhaa siten jeetne par jor diya
 The BJP chief's contention also included winning the seats of Guna and Chhindwara, which have been strongholds of Congress leaders Jyotiraditya Scindia and Kamal Nath for a long time and could not be snatched even in the 2014 Narendra Modi wave
 ol india majalis-e-ittehadul muslimin ke adhyaksh asaduddin ovaisi ke bhai akbaruddin ovaisi ek maheene ke ilaaj ke baad bharat laut aae hai
 When Akbaruddin returned from London on Friday morning suffering from a serious illness, supporters received a strong reception

 unhone kaha, "main aapako id kii mubarakawaad detaa hum or aapse prarthana karata hum ki aap asaddun kii sehat ke liye dua karen, wo ilaaj ke liye gaye hai
 i have come to know that his health has deteriorated once again
 allaah unhen mahfuj rakhen or unki sehat thik rakhen,"bataa den ki akbaruddin pehali baar ilaaj ke liye baahar nahin hai

 Premium charges apply !! Kapil Sharma has surprised everyone by canceling the shoot of KBC recently
 aakhir industry kemhanayakajis sho ko host kar rahe hon, uskaa shoot bhala koun cancel karana chahega! magarkapil sharmaane aisa hi kiya he
 Actually he was supposed to go for a shoot of KBC
 magar vah vahaan nahin pahunche
 This time, the reason is not his illness, but the ongoing FWICE (federation of Western India Cine Employees) strike in Mumbai
 is strike kii vajah se film or tivi industry kaa kaamkaaj lagbhag thap sa pad gaya he
 kbc's shoot could not escape it either
 ek taraf jahashmitabh bachchanakapil sharma ke saath kebisi sijan-9 kaa episod shoot karne ke liye puri tarah taiyaar the, vahinkapilworkars strike ke chalate shoot par pahunch hi nahin sake
 Eventually the shooting of the show had to be canceled
 kyon hai ye strikais strike kii vajah he vetan bhatton main badhottaree kii maang
 Because of this, many shoots have been canceled
 isamen koun banegaa karodpati se lekar padamavati, shahrukh khan kii agali film or jon abraham kii parmaanu kaa shoot prabhavit hua he
 Around 2
5 lakh employees are on strike at the moment

 lakhanu metro kaa uddhatan ho chukaa he
 Politics has also taken place at the inauguration
 shrey luutane kaa yuddh bhi ho chukaa he
 The metro has also deteriorated
 is bich kuch aisa bhi hua jo nahin hona chahie tha
 The person who should go to the credit of the success of the Lucknow Metro project is the 'metro Man' of the country and e Sreedharan, Chief Advisor of Lucknow Metro
 inke hi netritv main puri metro team ne kaam kiya or upi ko ye sundar saugat di
 But at the historic inauguration of the metro, Sreedharan was left behind at the time and all the leaders including Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Home Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the Metro by pressing the button
 (tasviir soshal media se)maukey par maujuud logon ke mutabik aisa isliye hua kyonki manch parashridharanki kursi kaa kram hi kuch aisa tha
 And in the haste of the inauguration, no one noticed them
 vajah jo bhi ho yah spasht he ki yah bhul agar hui to shrey lene ke hode main hi hui he
 The mind that brought the metro to the city of Nawabs, which gave Lucknow a new momentum, was left behind by a few steps
 gaur se dekhen to yah mahaj ek tasviir he lekin yah bahut kuch kah jaati he
 How much politics dominates in a better work, in development work, is just a hallmark of that

 com / njbafmt8oj— Akhilesh Yadav (@yadavakhilesh)september 3, 2017 In earlier developments, the CJI had called a collegium meeting with the government amid the ongoing controversy over the appointment of judges in the Supreme Court and the High Court
 justise je
 Chelameswar did not attend that meeting
 itnaa hi nahin, justise chelmeshwar ne is sambandh main pradhan nyaayadhish ties thakur ko patr bhi likhaa tha
 The comments sutron ke mutabik, justise chelmeshwar ke rukh ke chalate anya jajon ne baithak ko taal diya kyonki unka maananaa he ki isse bharat ke ucchtam nyaayalay kii pratishtha kaa avamulyan hota he
 On the other hand, Chief Justice of India TS Thakur, while giving his brief response on the issue yesterday, said, "we will resolve this issue
" " Significantly, in October last year, a five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court quashed the Central Government's National Judicial Appointment Commission (NJAC) as unconstitutional
 paanch sadasyeey bench main justise chelmeshwar ne sabase alag faisla sunaaya tha or colegium par sawaal uthaae the
 Supporting the law passed in Parliament, Justice Chelameswar criticized the collegium system of appointing judges
 unhone kaha tha ki isamen "koi javabdehi nahin he"
 According to sources, due to the stand of Justice Chelameswar, the other judges postponed the meeting as they believe that this undermines the prestige of the Supreme Court of India
 udhar, bharat ke pradhan nyaayadhish ties thakur ne is mudde par kal apni sankshipt pratikriya dete hue kaha tha, "ham is mudde ko sulajhaa lenge
 " gauratlab he ki pichley saal oktober main supreme court kii paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth ne centre sarkaar ke neshnal jeudicial appointment kamishan (engeesi) ko asanvaidhanik qaraar dete hue radd kar diya tha
 In a five-member bench, Justice Chelameswar had given a different verdict and questioned the collegium
 sansad main paarit kanoon kaa samarthan karte hue justise chelmeshwar ne jajon kii niyukti kii colegium pranali kii aalochana kii thi
 He said it had "no accountability"

 But in this era of excess of information, when every person knows everything better than you, you also have your definite opinion on it, and in the self-proclaimed 'newsbreak' you are not able to be shocked, then you expect this from a special report
 Can only do that it has the potential to provoke you
 lihaaja, is hafte kii khaas rapat mujhe kuch sawaal poochne ke liye uksaati he
 If Narendra Modi is giving such rights to his bureaucrats, which is almost unpredictable, then he is giving them strength or weakening them? Are they inaugurating Babu Raj or moving towards ending it? Limiting or restoring the power and authority of the political executive? They are breaking the 'tradition' or are intending to make 'system' or are making a way to return to the tradition itself? If i say that the steps that Narendra Modi is taking, in fact, he has been in the last 10 years If there is a step towards the decisive end of Raj, then what will you say on this? Before you give me a very familiar advice, that is to say, Shekhar Gupta ji, get your mind checked, just check these facts
 haalanki in dinon aisa koi karata nahin
 Contrary to what you think, the upa's one-decade rule is actually the happiest period for Indian babushi, which does not mean that Babu Shahi had become omnipotent and ministers were weakened
 ek myne main is daur main donon hi kamjor hue, unka aatmavishvaas gata, ruaab gata or ve dayaneey haalat main aa gaye
 However, the life of bureaucrats in this decade was very comfortable
 kaary avadhi bhi kam-se-kam paanch saal to bad hi gai
 Never before in the history of India that in a decade, so few technocrats, experts and later masters came into the bureaucracy
 dow
 Manmohan Singh was appointed as Finance Secretary and later as Governor of Technocrat Rat RBI
 unke sabase kareebi salaahkaar or sudhaaron ke pairokaar montek singh ahaluwalia ko baad main pravesh dilaakar vitt sachiv banaaya gaya
 It is noteworthy that between 2004 and 2014, not a single non-ias officer was brought into the economic bureaucracy to disrupt, intellectual diversity or challenge this pleasant system
 dow
 In the last year of his power, Manmohan Singh chose an 'outsider' for an important economic post
 raghuram rajan ko arabiai kaa governor banaaya gaya
 That too when it became clear that a man of lighter stature than him would not be able to put a stop to global concerns and improve the country's rapidly declining rating

 V
 shahi ko bijli sachiv ke rup main lekar aae the or unki krantikari soch ne bijli ke kshetra main vyapak sudhaaron kii shuruyaat kii thi
 The bureaucracy did not face any such challenge under the UPA rule, but the establishment of new regulators during this period led to an unprecedented expansion of bureaucracy
 kuch nae niamak kai sadasyon vaale hai
 It happened that no one knew who was regulating whom because the whole system was tied in tangled wires
 lagata tha ki niamak ke liye do hi yogyataayen jaruri hai— kariyar naukarshah ho or seva se ritair ho chukaa ho
 In the Modi era, the discussions of the young, passionate about work and high-ranking officials will be heard, similarly an officer (let's give them the benefit of anonymity as usual) recently asked me: You noticed How the government has fixed the minimum age of appointment of the regulator as 60 years? Why can't a 40-year-old expert in his field be a regulator? But why am i so serious about regulators? The reason is that this example is the most accurate to show that the bureaucracy has found such a crush in the last decade as never before
 60 varsh ke baad seva vistaar or nai dilli main maujuud bhawanon kaa vistaar
 Seniority was the only qualification for officers sitting in some of the oldest business areas in South Delhi

 In the 21st century, around 100 Lutyens-style bungalows were built on the basis of 'SAIL' financing
 is kisse par phir kabhi charchaa hogi
 If we examine the people living in those bungalows, then most of the retired officers are now sitting in comfortable positions
 motaa vetan paa rahe hai or daayitv kuch bhi nahin
 So the states also took inspiration from here and built similar rest houses too
 adhikariyon ko soochna ayog, bijli dar niamak, tex tribunel vagairah main bitha diya
 The UPA government appointed former bureaucrats as governors instead of a large number of leaders
 usne kabhi kisi raajnneetijna ko mahatvapurn duutavas main nahin bheja
 Dr
 singh ne apane sarvaadhik vishwasaneey naukarshahon ko adhikaar die, taaki ve unke agenda ko teji se aage badha saken
 For example, Rahul Khullar (once his personal secretary in the finance ministry) was made the Commerce Secretary and later the TRAI chiefs, Shyam Saran and Satinder Lamba, were sent for a nuclear deal and a possible agreement on Kashmir
 donon ne apane mantriyon ko bemaani bana diya
 Did the bureaucracy become so powerful when the UPA was so much cared for during a decade of rule? If you think so, then let me count only five bureaucrats who left their mark

 Lalu also made several serious allegations to Nitish
 lalu ne nitish par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki istipha puraa tarah set tha
 Nitish has also filed a case of 302 and cognizance has been taken against him
 desh kaa koi bhi mukhyamantri nahin he jis par hatya kaa mukadmaa darj ho
 The case registered against them carries a death sentence
 yah bayaan meraa nahin he balki unke halafname main is maamle kaa zikr he, to vah siem ke pad par kaise baith the
 Torture is greater than honesty and corruption and Nitish Kumar is accused of the same murder
 yahi jiro tolerance policy he mere chote bhai nitish kumaar kii
 He knew that now we are not going to be saved in this case, so he resigned himself without asking Tejashwi to resign
 iske alaava lalu ne ek ke baad ek twit karke bhi nitish par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Lalu has also challenged Nitishko to go to the polls
 lalu ne twit kar kaha ki naitikta or bhrashtachar kii duhai dene vaale nitish ko chunaav main aana chahie
 You will find out how much the people are with them in the fight for corruption / morality? Nitish, who is crying for morality and corruption, should come to the polls

 Pakistani army violates ceasefire on loc
 Pakistan appeals to Indian army to exercise restraint
 Pakistani army violated ceasefire on Tuesday
 pakistani sena kii golabari kii vajah se bachche skulon main hi fanse rah gaye
 Surprisingly, before this action, Pakistan itself appealed to the Indian Army to exercise restraint
 pakistan ne apil karte hue kaha tha ki wo rajanyikon or patrakaron ko paak adhikrut kashmir (pioke) main niyantran rekha ke paas ke ilaakon main le jane kii yojana bana rahaa he
 a group of diplomats and journalists visited the forward areas, while the Pakistani Army violated the ceasefire on the loc on Tuesday
 us paar se poonch ke mendhar sector main firing or mortar gole daage gaye
 Sources in the Indian Army said, "through the established channels of dialogue, they told us not to violate the ceasefire as the diplomatic community and journalists had to visit the loc
 ’bhartiya sena ne is aagrah kaa sammaan kiya lekin khud pakistani sena ne sizafire kaa ulanghan kiya
 Let us know that Pakistan had launched heavy shelling on Saturday targeting the civilians in Tangdhar sector
 bhartiya sena ne bhi uskaa makul jawaab diya
 Shelling from both sides continued for 10 hours
 bhartiya sena ne chaar aatanki thikaanon ko nasht kiya
 In this action, some posts of Pakistani army were also damaged
 pakistan ko us vakt sharmasarhona padaa jab pioke ke mujaffarabad main pakistan sarkaar ke khilaaf logon ne azaadi ke liye pradarshan kiya
 He also had a confrontation with Pak security personnel
 ye us din hua, jis din pakistani sena rajanyikon or patrakaaro ko elosi ke paas ke ilaakon main le gaya
 Apple is making headlines with the launch of iphone-6
 yphone-6 or yphone-6 plus ke launch hone ke 24 ghante ke andar hi 40 lakh phone order kiye ja chuke hai
 The company said that the delivery of iphone-6 and iphone-6 Plus will start from September 19 but in some places the phone will not be delivered till October
 pichley shuukravaar ko appal kii website zyada online order kiye jane kii vajah se thap ho gai thi
 The craze of Apple's phone has been very popular among the people before
 pichley saal appal ne phone kii bikri shuru hone ke 3 din ke andar 90 lakh phone beche the
 The Apple iphone-6 was launched only last week
 bharat main isaki keemat 50 hajaar rupee se zyada hogi
 However, the company has not made any formal announcement in this regard
 ek baar phir pahchaan card banane kii taiyaari shuru ho gai he
 The work of identification of Indian citizens will now resume
 ghar-ghar jaakar sarkari karmchaaree bhartiya nagarikon kii pahchaan karenge
 The Central Government has directed that the names of all citizens of the country should be recorded in the National Population Register in three years
 sarkaar kaa makasad he ki teen saal main sabhi nagarikon kaa veriphication ho jaae or sirf bhartiya nagarikon ko hi yah card mili
 This card will be the biggest proof of his identity and even when casting his vote, it has to be kept
 sarkaar inhen banavaakar sunishchit karnaa chaahati he ki sirf bhartiya naagarik hi isamen registerd hon
 People have to present one of the six types of documents already set up to prove their identity
 jaahir he is abhiyaan par sarkaar bahut shakti lagaaegi or badi rakam kharch karegi 
 But the question is what will happen to the Aadhar card that the government spent billions of rupees to make? The government created an entire department to create the Aadhaar card, gave Nandan Nilekani the status of cabinet minister and spent billions of rupees
 is abhiyaan main hajaaron karmchaaree shaamil hue or ghar-ghar jaakar soochna ikatthi kii gai
 But later in the UPA government itself, its credibility was questioned and it was said to work on the NPR project
 ab endie sarkaar ne isamen puraa jor lagane kaa faisla kiya he
 But the question arises again that even by making cards in this country so many times, we could not identify foreign nationals living illegally
 khud bijepi kaa hi daawa he ki bharaat main ek karod se zyada bangladeshi avaidh rup se rahete hai
 Surprisingly, they have all kinds of cards including passports
 rashan card vagairah to bahut saadhaaran si baat he
 Now the government wants only genuine Indian citizens to register for the new card
 lekin yah hoga kaise? jab passport jaisaa samvedansheel or mahatvapurn dastavej avaidh naagarik banavaa lete hai to koi bhi card ban saktaa he
 For that too, the policemen go home to investigate
 iske baavjood aisi khabaren aati he ki kai logon ke paas kai passport hai
 If this is the case then how can it be said about this new card that it will be made in a very safe manner
 jis desh ke diene main hi bhrashtachar ghus gaya ho vahaan aise card puri eemaandaaree se ban jaaenge, isaki kya guarantee he? paise dekar to bangladesh se bharat kii seemaa main aaj bhi hajaaron log ghus jate hai unke card banane se kaise roke jaaenge?isse bhi badi baat yah he ki yah kaise sunishchit kiya ja sakegaa ki jo lakhon bangladeshi bharat main ghus gaye hai, unke card phir se nahin bane? phir jo behad garib or beghar log hai unke card kaise banenge kyonki unke paas to koi dastavej tak nahin he
 Workers coming from remote villages in the metros, millions of workers who sweep the houses, do not have any documents
 unke card kaise banenge bhala? ye sabhi sawaal jatil or praasangik hai
 What will the government do to resolve them? Does he have any plans? Just by declaring that government employees will go from house to house and find out, the difference between legitimate and illegal will not disappear
 vot bank kii raajnneeti ke kaaran sthaneey netaa bhi nahin chaahate ki kuch aisa ho
 It is known that in Bihar, Bengal, Assam and even Delhi, Bangladeshis were given shelter by local leaders and converted into vote banks
 ab dekhne kii baat to yahi he ki sarkaar kaise ise lagu karti he or iske kaise parinaam aate hai
 Till then we can only wait

 CPI (M) leader Prakash Karat has demanded strict action against the state government against the officials responsible for the death of Khalid Mujahid, an accused in the court blast in Uttar Pradesh
 saath hi karaat kaa ye bhi kahana he ki is puure maamle kii jaanch sibiai se karaani chaiye
