 It is now known what was China's intention behind this war
 china ke divangat kaddavar netaa maotse tung ne ‘great lip forward’ andolan kii asafalataa ke baad sattadhari communist party par apana phir se niyantran kaayam karne ke liye bharat ke saath varsh 1962 kaa yuddh chhedaa tha
 One of China's top strategists is Wang Jisi
 unhone yah baat gat shanivaar ko yuddh kii 50veen saalagirah ke maukey par karke yuddh kaa ek nayaa pahalu pesh kar diya
 "the war was a tragic event," said Wang Jiesi, dean of China's Peking University's School of International Studies and a member of the Foreign Policy Advisory Committee of China's Foreign Ministry
 vah aavashyak nahin tha
 He said that his perception differs from many Chinese political and strategic analysts that China's victory overstated India's claim to the border and established a long-term peace
 bhartiya rajanyikon ke anusaar china netritv kai baar jisi se salaah mashvira karata tha
 Jisi said, 'I believe we should do some research
 maine ek kissa suna he ki yah maotse tung ke china main apni sthiti ke bhay ke chalate tha ki unhone varsh 1962 yuddh shuru kiya tha
 'he said,' After the Great Leap Forward (GLF) in 1962, Maotse lost power and authority
 vah ab desh ke pramukh nahin the or vah tathakthith duusari pankti main chale gaye
 The explanation we were given at that time was that he was more interested in revolution and other things
 ’great lip forward (jielef) ek jayeebhiyaan tha jisaki shuruyaat maotse tung ne desh ko ek krishi aadhaarit arthvyastha se aadhunik communist samaaj main tabdeel karne ke liye china kii vishaal jansankhya kaa istemaal karne ke liye kiya
 The movement proved to be a waste to China as millions of people fell prey to violence
 isse maotse kii desh kii sattadhari communist party aaf china (sipisi) ke sarvocch netaa ke taur par sthiti kamjor hui
 Wang Jisi said, 'he (maotse) naturally lost control over many practical issues
 isliye vah yah sabit karnaa chaahate the ki vah abhi bhi satta main hai vishesh rup se sena kaa niyantran unke haathon main he
 So he called the commander of Tibet and asked Zhang if you were confident that you could win the war with India
 ’ jhang guohua tibet regiment ke tatkaaleen piele commander the
 According to Wang Jisi, 'the commander said,' Yes maotse, we can win the war easily
 unhone kaha, ‘aage badho or ise anjaam do
 'it was intended to demonstrate that they have personal control over the military
 isliye iskaa seemaa vivaad se bahut kam hi lenaa dena tha (ho saktaa he ki tibet se ho lekin yah jaruri nahin)

 In such a situation, the situation can be more serious

 Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh, who has been lobbying Rahul Gandhi for the post of Prime Minister, said on Sunday that this young leader of the Gandhi family is now mature enough to handle this top political post in the country
 digvijay ne kaha, rahul 40 varsh ke ho gaye hai or ve pichley saat-aath saal se party ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 He has matured and has the right curious political tendencies inside him
 unhone kaha ki rahul main pradhanmantri banane ke saare gun or anubhav aa gayi hai or ab vah is pad kaa daayitv sanbhaalane ke liye taiyaar hai
 However, the final decision will have to be taken by Rahul himself
 khud par lage alpsankhyakon kii tushtikaran ke aaropon ko galat bataate hue congress mahasachiv ne kaha ki jab vah mukhyamantri the tab unhone bajrang dal or simi donon ke khilaaf karrwai kii thi
 He said that when the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan is welcomed by Muslims at a program, no one calls it appeasement, but when he visited Azamgarh, his visit was opposed by the Ulema Council, BJP and RSS
 haal hi main bhaajapa main waapas lautin madhyapradesh kii purv mukhyamantri uma bharti ke bare main digvijay ne kaha ki is sadhvi netaa kaha tha ki agar ve bhaajapa main lautin to vah apane maa-baap ke prati vafaadaar nahin rahengi 
 
 to ab aisa maan liya janaa chahie
 Regarding the debate that has arisen these days about the members of the society, he said that there is no way under which the elected representatives should be treated as equal to the non-elected people of the society
 haalanki, iske baavjood gaiyr nirvaachit logon ke vichaaron ko bhi dhyaan main rakhane kii bahut aavashyaktaa he
 He said that it was for this reason that Congress President Sonia Gandhi nominated members of the society as members in the National Advisory Committee and its members like Aruna Rai and Harshamander were engaged in drafting the Lokpal Bill
 singh ne kaha ki kyonki samprag sarkaar bhrashtachar ke prati samvedansheel he isliye usne is vidheyak kaa masauda banane vaali sanyukt samiti main aravind kejariwal or shantibhushan jaise logon ko bhi shaamil kiya, jabaki ye log congress ke khilaaf hai
 Targeting the bjp-ruled Madhya Pradesh government, he said that when he was the Chief Minister of the state, the literacy rate in the state had increased a lot but in the last ten years it has fallen very low
 unhone kaha ki rajya main kuposhan se peedit bacchon kii sankhya bhi pehle se bahut zyada ho gai he, haalanki aajkal pradesh sarkaar ko pehle kii tulana main paanch guna se bhi zyada raashi kendra se mil rahi he
 Regarding former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Uma Bharti, who recently returned to BJP, Digvijay said that this sadhvi leader had said that if she returned to BJP, she would not be loyal to her parents
 
 So it should be assumed now
 samaaj ke sadasyon ko lekar in dinon uthi bahes ke sambandh main unhone kaha ki aisa koi bhi tarika nahin he jiske tahat chune hue numaayindon ko samaaj ke gaiyr nirvaachit logon ke baraabar maanakar chalaa jaae
 However, in spite of this there is a great need to keep the views of non-elected people in mind
 unhone kaha ki isi kaaran se congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne samaaj ke sadasyon ko rashtriya salaahkaar samiti main sadsy ke rup main manonith kiya he or aruna raay or harshamandar jaise iske sadsy lokapal vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar karne main lage hue the
 Singh said that because the UPA government is sensitive to corruption, it also included people like Arvind Kejriwal and Shanti Bhushan in the joint committee that drafted this bill, while these people are against the Congress
 bhaajapa shasit madhyapradesh sarkaar ko nishaanaa banaate hue unhone kaha ki jab vah rajya ke mukhyamantri the tab pradesh main sakshartaa dar bahut bad gai thi, lekin pichley das saalon main vah bahut neeche gir gai he
 He said that the number of children suffering from malnutrition in the state has also gone up much earlier, although nowadays the state government is getting more than five times the amount from the center

 AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi has targeted the Modi government when EU mps visited Kashmir
 owesi ne kaha ki ye koun log hai? inhen kyon bulaayaa gaya he? musalamaanon se nafrat karne vaale or hitler ko chaahane waalon ko bulaayaa gaya he
 Owsi said, 'who are these people? Why do they have to show? It is not an official delegation
 jab aadhikarik pratinidhimandal nahin he to kyon bulaayaa gaya? jo musalmaan or islam se nafrat karte hai or hitler ko chaahane vaale hai, unhen bulaayaa gaya he
 Many of these mps, who want Hitler, are fascists

 Udayan, born in Virendra Das and Indrani Das's home in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh on April 24, 1984, no one thought that he would be a vicious brain killer
 bachapan se hi galat sangat main pad gaye udayan kii 10veen tak kii padhai bhopal main hui thi
 After that he went to Raipur for studies up to 12th standard
 iske baad bhilai ke roomta college main ejineering kii padhai ke liye daakhila liya, lekin tisare saal main fail ho gaya
 At the same time, Akanksha, who hails from Bankura, West Bengal, had come in contact with Udayan since 2007
 donon soshal netwarking site fasebuk ke jariye ek-duusare se jude the
 Akanksha did her msc from Jaipur
 uske baad dilli main rahane lagi
 Udayan had told his girlfriend Akanksha that he lives in America
 apane gharavaalon se milane ke liye aksar bhopal aayaa karata he
 At the same time, Akanksha flew to Bhopal to meet her
 premi se milane flite se jaati thi aakanksha- police ke mutabik, udayan apni garlfriend se kahata tha ki uske paas samay bahut kam he
 He wants to live with aspiration for a few days
 uske baad america chalaa jayega
 Due to this, Akanksha used to fly to Bhopal to meet Udayan
 udayan se milakar jaise hi waapas jaati vah waapas apane ghar chalaa jaataa
 His same lie proved to be a time for aspiration
 use jab udayan kii hakeekat pataa chali, to donon main jhagada hua
 Due to doubt, she had taken the life of aspiration - when Udayan's pole was exposed in front of aspiration, she started feeling angry with him
 uski beyrukhee udayan ko khatakane lagi
 He often felt that Akanksha secretly talked to someone on the phone
 is baat par 14 july
 In 2016, the two debated
 is bahes ke baad udayan usne maarane kaa plan bana liya
 As soon as he woke up the next morning, he sat on the chest of aspiration
 takie se uskaa tab tak munh dabaata rahaa, jab tak ki uski saansen nahin tham gayi
 Watching the TV serial made a creepy plan- If accused Udayan believes that after watching season 5 of the English horror TV show 'walking Dead', he got an idea of how to hide his girlfriend's body
 isi aadhaar par usne aakanksha kii laash ko ghar main dafan kar diya tha
 Not only this, in 2011, he had also murdered his parents and buried their dead bodies in the garden of the house
 police ne khudaai ke dauraan aakanksha or uske maa-baap kaa kathith kankal baraamad kiya he
 Mother's throat kept pressing for 10 minutes - Udayan told the police that he continued to strangle the mother for 10 minutes
 vahiin pita ko maarane ke liye usne chaay main neend kii goliyon kaa istemaal kiya
 However, in another statement, he has said to give drugs to the mother as well
 donon hatyaein usne shaam kareeb 4 baje kii thi
 After this, Udayan had a challenge to bury the corpse on the ground
 aise main usne saamne ke ghar main kaam kar rahe mazdooron ko gadda khodne ke liye taiyaar kiya
 Udayan buried the body of the parents - Udayan told the workers that he had to dig the septic tank
 raat main kaam hoga isliye dogune paise die jaaenge
 The workers started digging at 6:30 pm
 takreeban 4 se 5 ghante tak khudaai karne ke baad ve paise lekar chale gaye
 With the workers, he dug a pit about seven feet deep for the tank
 unke jane ke baad raat lagbhag 12:30 baje usne apane mata-pita ko gadde main dafnaaya
 In the same manner, he was buried after killing his girlfriend
 colgirl ke saath garlfriend kii kabr par sota- udayan ke mutabik aakanksha kii hatya ke baad wo depressant main chalaa gaya tha
 Everyday he tried to end himself by drinking alcohol, but could not muster the courage to commit suicide
 kaha to yahaan tak ja rahaa he ki udayan apni garlfriend kii kabr par roj sota tha
 Sprinkled that fragrant perfume
 kabhi kabhaar to colgirl bulaakar unke saath raate rangeen karata tha
 The murder case is becoming a challenge for the police

 ek chaatr ne kaha ki khun neeche se nikal rahaa tha, is jawaab se bhi vidhayak ji kaa dil nahin bharaa to unhone aglaa sawaal daag diya
 MLA Lalan Paswan told the students what does the below mean? You are all educated girls and you guys should answer correctly
 agar tum log sahi se jawaab nahin dogi to ho saktaa he kal ko tumhaare saath bhi balaatkaar ho jaae
 This obscene conversation between the MLA and the students has created a ruckus
 janata dal unitedne maang kii he ki vidhayak lalan paswan ko apni is harakat ke liye turant chaatraon se maafee maangi chahie
 Janata Dal United spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said whatever question the MLA asked is indecent and for this he should apologize to the students

 Preventing the entry of women in the Sabarimala temple is gender discrimination
 4
 There can be no discrimination in devotion
 5
 Religion is a way of living, where life is linked to God
 6
 Stopping the entry of women in the Sabarimala temple is a violation of the rights of Hindu women
 7
 The thinking of a patriarchal society cannot be allowed to abolish equality in devotion
 8
 The devotees of Ayyappa are not a separate religious class
 9
 The prohibition on women entering the temple from 10 years to 50 years is not a necessary part of religion
 10
 Justice Indu Malhotra held a different view that society decides, not the court, how religion should be practiced

 Sometimes from outside someone's room or sometimes in someone's meeting, peeping from behind, how big was that common man in a small box of cartoons
 jise rose aar ke lakshmana hamaare liye khinchaa karte the
 Sometimes with your smile, sometimes looking carelessly as if no one has seen, or sometimes you have seen that you have seen everything
 aar ke lakshmana ab hamaare bich nahin hai
 The Times of India will remain a corner without them
 bina lakshmana ke kone se wo akhbaar kaise puraa lagegaa soch kar ankhen bhar aati hai
 There have been reports of Laxman passing away from a hospital in Pune

 aap ise gaiyr-angrezi aam aadmi kah sakate hai jo marathi to bolta he, punjabi to bolta he magar angrezi nahin jaanata
 The power is like an English for him who understands while speaking that no one is understanding, but the common man of Laxman used to listen and walk away from there
 lakshmana ke aam aadmi ke dekhne par ek puri kitaab likhi ja sakati he
 It must have been written
 satta ko baahar se saamaanya or tatasth bhav se dekhnaa lakshmana ne sikhaaya
 These days we are beginning to see power as power
 lakshmana kaa aam aadmi satta se duuri banaae rakhane kaa sanket tha
 Distance should be kept from this
 iske har kaam ko ek aadmi kii nigaah se dekha janaa chahie
 That's why Laxman's common man looked up
 jhaankna ek aisi kriya he jiske pataa hone kaa ahsaas us jagah yaa vyakti ko nahin hota jahaan koi nigaah baahar se bheetar se aa rahi hoti he
 To save someone, to save and to see everything is to peek
 lakshmana kaa aam aadmi is hairat se jhaankta tha jaise jo nahin dekhni chahie thi wo bhi usne dekh liya he
 The public has come to know everything, not just the saints
 lakshmana ne hamen is loktantr main jhaankna sikhaaya he
 r k Laxman used to draw a new Laxman Rekha for power every day
 ve yaad dilaate the ki aapane jo vaada kiya he uski lakshmana rekha kahaan khatm hoti he
 Are you going somewhere beyond that? ek aisi khamosh awaz jo bolne vaale netaaon se bhi zyada bolti thi
 Which was also spoken in the plot of their silent moments
 aam aadmi ko ram yaa devtaa to sab kehete the magar apane ram kii zindgibhar kisi ne khidamat kii to sirf lakshmana ne
 Laxman's loyalty and responsibility remained only the common man who was his Rama
 aapke cartoon sirf mile ke pathar nahin hai
 Rather, those are the stones of the conscience of power that no one can escape without colliding
 lakshmana sahab aapke cartoon hamaare jazbaat hai

 BSF sacked soldier Tej Bahadur (tej Bahadur Yadav )'s plan to contest against PM Modi (PM Modi) collapsed
 chunaav ayog ne unka namakan khaarij kar diya he
 On Wednesday, Tej Bahadur Yadav, while rejecting the nomination, was saying that on one hand there was conspiracy against him, on the other hand he was also saying that he could not contest the election due to the rejection of nomination but his voice Nobody can press
 ab wo banaras rah kar hi modi ko haarane ke liye sapa kaa prachaar karenge
 The nomination in the district court of Banaras may have ended, but the same thing has been done here on Wednesday, the major reason for this controversy is the validity of the nomination of Tej Bahadur Yadav, an independent and later SP candidate
 She kept taking it
 tej bahadur (tej Bahadur Yadav) bhi apane vakil ke saath tay samay par jila nirvachan adhikari ke paas jawaab dene ke liye pahunch gayi the
 He also made an answer, but by the evening it became clear that his answer was not enough, so the form was rejected
 tej bahadur ise apane khilaaf saazish bataate hai " subah hamane 11 baje jaise hi jawaab daakhil kiya usee ke just thodi der baad chunaav ayog se bhi clearence aa gaya 
 Even after that, we were kept seated till three and a half hours, seven to eight times the paper was torn and orders were coming from Delhi that somehow the nomination of this jawan should be canceled
 ab hamen last main kaha ki jab aap donon ne namakan kiya tha tab chunaav ayog se parmishan kaa letters nahin diya
 The Samajwadi Party had targeted several targets with one stone by giving tickets to the sacked BSF jawan
 usame se tir kaa nishaanaa ye thi ki agar tej bahadur kaa namakan valid ho jaataa or wo chunaav maidan main modi se do do haath karte to unhen sena ke mudde par unhi ke ghar main gherte or kehete ki ye ladaai asli chaukeedaar banaam nakli chaukeedaar kii he or jab ab namakan cancil ho gaya he
 So, using Tej Bahadur as another arrow from the mouth of a soldier from every platform, where he will say that his nomination is rejected, on the other hand PM Modi, seeking votes in the name of the army, got a reply from a young man
 We will try to air this mission
 yani tej bahadur ko lekar samaajawaadee party ke donon haanthon main laddu tha
 Significantly, Tej Bahadur had earlier filed an independent form in which he had filled the reason for his withdrawal from the army in response to 'yes' and later when he enrolled from SP, wrote 'no' in the same column
 farm ke scrootni ke dauraan isi baat kaa spashtikaran maanga gaya saath hi niyam kaa hawala dete huve chunaav ayog se ek certificate laane ko kaha gaya jo tej bahadur nahin de paae
 District Magistrate Surendra Singh said that one of the candidates, Tej Bahadur, had made two nominations
 unki scrootni ko defer kiya gaya tha, koi bhi vyakti central gavarment yaa state gavarment main naukari kar rahaa tha usase dismis hua ho or us dismisil kii taarikh paanch saal ke andar kii ho aise sabhi cases main section 9 ke tahat campalsari he ki wo ellection kamishan se ek letters laaegaa
 According to the Representation of the People Act, a certificate was required from the Election Commission and this process was not completed here
 We also gave a chance that if they did not bring it till 11 pm, their nomination was canceled after hearing
 jila nirvachan ayog ke is daleel ko tej bahadur or unke vakil is baat se khaarij karte he ki jab nirdaleey parchaa bharaa gaya tha tab uske baad aisi koi cheez kyon nahin maangi gai samaajawaadee party se bharne ke baadi hi kyon
 For this reason, they feel that there has been a political conspiracy, however, after their papers are rejected, the socialist party will now work Plan B, their second candidate Shalini Yadav will compete with Modi Joe
 jinka namakan bhi usee din huwa tha 
 SP spokesperson Manoj Rai Dhupchandi makes it more clear "earlier, we had the idea that the 56-inch chest had to be spoken only by mouth, the statement is BJP people, we thought that if no other assistant was hired If Gaya will definitely be rejected, then we have rejected another assistant Shalini Yadav now (patch), so the name of Shalini Yadav was already there as a Substitute candidate

 Thank you so much for all your wishes 🙏 I'm still in the hospital recovering, and will be sharing my birth story soon :) # babyboy xxrep 24 _ # chhavimittal # pregnancy # boy # son # motherhood # motherandsona post shared bychhavi Mittal (@chhavihussein ) onmay 13, 2019 at 9:02 pm pdtview this post on instagramthe 10th MONTH
 
 
 Here i am, thinking i have seen it all and heard it all
 
 
 But in the 11th hour of my pregnancy, there's yet another myth that i need to address! The 10th month
 Yes, there is a 10th month in pregnancy, and I'm currently living it
 So many people tried to correct me in one of my recent posts, thinking i may have accidentally written 10th instead of 9th
 No it was no accident
 The 10th month, as logic suggests, starts after the 9th month ends
 After 36 weeks of pregnancy, the baby is officially ready to come into this world
 40 weeks is considered a full term, and that's when the doctor gives you your EDD (estimated due date)
 The due date is always ESTIMATED because nobody can predict when the baby arrives
 It is extremely common and absolutely normal for women to reach 42 weeks before natural labor begins
 
 especially if it's the second pregnancy
 
 
 and once you cross 38 / 39 weeks, your 10th month begins
 So, while my clock ticks, i could go into labor right this minute, or another week later
 
 
 I'm not worried
 On the contrary, I'm rather relaxed
 Because i know, once the baby comes, I'll have my hands full! And i think now is the perfect time to also say that it's always the baby who decides when labour will begin
 So you can try all you want, get restless, get scans done, pray that the baby comes out fast (I know it's uncomfortable)
 
 
 But trust me, the baby is the most comfortable inside you! So don't hold your breath
 
 
 But remember, good things come to those who wait

 unhone ummid jataai ki janadesh congress ke paksh main aayega
 Ashok Gehlot, who returned to Jaipur from Delhi, told reporters in response to a question at the airport, 'let the results come first and then we will talk about which direction the country is going
 desh kii dasha or disha is janadesh par nirbhar karegi, aisa meraa maananaa he
 This is democracy, how people give mandates in democracy will depend on which direction the country will go
 'gahalot ne kedarnath main dhyaan lagane ko lekar PM modi kaa majaak udaaya, kaha- bhagwaan jaane
 
 
 Gehlot (ashok Gehlot) accused the BJP of contesting elections without issue and polarizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 gahalot ne kaha, ‘kabhi kedarnath, badrinaath jaao
 Sometimes you sit down in meditation and give the message of polarization across the country

 ham usko puri vinamrata ke saath sweekaar karenge
 We believe that the people's mandate will come in our favor

 Everything that happened in a year is being investigated
 rajanetaaon se lekar abhinaytaon tak
 But where is the world of Hindi books and readers in this list of investigations? The same Hindi, which is the mother tongue of over 42 crore people according to the 2011 census
 vahi hindi, jisamen har saal 10,000 se zyada nai kitaaben chhapati hai
 That means 27 books on an average every day

 Many writers, including the storyteller Priyamvad, passed it on

 2014 main is kitaab kii 1,600 pratiyambikin or kul milakar ab tak 5,500 pratiyaan bik chuki hai
 Although selling five and a half thousand copies of a book in the language of 42 crore people is not a magic figure, but in a language where 500 copies of editions are printed and thousands of copies are not sold without the help of government procurement, this number too No less pleasant
 in tamaam aankadon ke bich clasik banaam popular vaali bahes apni jagah kaayam he
 Is the sign of a society alive and thoughtful that how much literature and books have its place in the world? Is what is selling good? What is not selling, why is it not selling? Can not serious literature be popular and a big seller

 The readers are searching, but the books are not reaching them
 ” anil yadav bhi kitabon ke bhavishya ko bahut ummid se dekhte hue kehete hai, ''hindi main pathak bad rahe hai or unhen acchhee kitabon kii talash he
 An important aspect is that the purchasing power of Hindi society has also increased
 ”agar pathak bad rahe hai or kitaab kharidne kii kshamta bhi to phir kitaaben kyon nahin bik raheen? itani ki lekhak sirf lekhan ko apni aajeevika kaa saadhan bana le

 According to Anil Yadav, the biggest problem of Hindi is that a lot of garbage is being printed here every year in the name of books
 us lekhan main jivan ke vrihattar sawaalon kaa hal dhundne kii koi koshish or bechaini nahin he
 However, many books in Hindi are seen trying this way because the author of these books is not from traditional schools

 People from fields like engineering and IIT are turning to Hindi writing

 However, police say that the cause of death will be known only in the post mortem report

 'het story-2' or 'het story-3' jaisi sexi murder mistry banane vaale vishaal pandya kii agali film 'vajah tum' ho kaa trailor relies ho gaya he
 The kind of filmmaking that Vishal is famous for, the same kind of filmmaking can be seen in 'reason Tum Ho'
 film main sanaa khan bold avatar main najar aa rahi hai, or apni khoobasarat kaaya or kinsing kaa bharpoor jalawaa lutaa rahi hai
 Apart from him, there is Hot and sexysharleen Chopra Bhabhi who has been in the news due to her bold style, 'kamasutra' film and shoot in 'playboy Mansion'
 lo bajet bollywood murder mistry ho or usamen sex kaa chhaunk na ho, aisa ho hi nahin saktaa
 Let us explain why it is important to have the touch of sex in such films: high prices in low prices, often such Murder Mystery is low budget films
 jinaki starcast bahut badi nahin hoti he, or produsar kaa focus film kii aisi euaspy kaayam karne par hota he jisase kam daam main jabardast publicity batori ja sake
 Then Mayanagari is very much inspired by the saying that if there are bad names, what name will not be there
 bas, yahaan aakar boldnes kaa chhaunk lag jaataa he, or murder mistry main pyaar ke kuch haseen pal jud jate hai
 Badan's support for drowning heroines is smaller than the starcast of such films
 jaise'het story-3'main lead main jarine khan or dezi shah thim
 Both of their careers were disastrous
 aise main unhen ek aise short kii jarurat thi jo unhen raturaat surkhiyon main laa de
 He embraced boldness and his hot scene in the film brought him fame
 ab sanaa khan ko hi len vah big bos main aakar surkhiyaan bator chuki hai, ek vivaadaaspad vigyaapan bhi kar chuki hai
 Also did many Bollywood films but luck did not last
 ab unhone apane eks factor ko pahachaanakar uskaa bharpoor istemaal karne kaa faisla kiya he
 The spice of the public was a time when we used to run morning shows in theaters
 ek khaas tabaka un sho ko dekhne pahunchataa tha
 But say the beat of technology or the threat of multiplex culture
 in filmon ke jamaane lad gaye or is audiyans kii ekadam andekhi ho gai
 These single-screened listeners take these kinds of films in hand
 isliye kam bajet filmon main diarector har vah masala daalane kii koshish karata he, jisase single screen kii ore khinche chale aane vaale darshak ko har vah maal mili jiske liye usne ghar se kadam nikaale hai
 Deadly combinations have been the soul of popular literature ranging from love, sex and cheatjames Headley Chaise to Surendra Mohan Pathak and Ved Prakash Sharma, sex and cheating
 yah aisa masala he or jo chir kaal se bikta aayaa he
 Then whether it is Murder or Jism or Hate Story Series
 in sab main lav, sex or dhokhaa kaa swar pradhan rahaa he, or isi factor ne film ko khinchaa bhi he
 What is seen is sold, it has often been seen that if the story is a bit strong and the sex is strong, then the film saves itself at the box office
 'jism' film main bipasha ne tahalaka machaa diya tha
 Then Sunny Leone enthralled the audience with Jism-2
 isi tarah 'murder' main malikaa sheravat ne darshakon aahen bharne par majaboor kiya
 Then in this episode, the names of Paoli Dam, Surveen Chawla, Zarine Khan and now Sana Khan have been added
 in filmon ko box offis par acha record bhi rahaa he
 Union Petroleum Minister Murli Deora said on Tuesday that the government may cut oil prices after the assembly elections
 isse pehle devda tel kii keemton main katautee ko lekar koi bhi bayaan dene se bachate rahe the
 a few days ago, Deora while answering a supplementary question during the Question Hour in Lok Sabha said that this issue is being monitored and an announcement will be made soon
 devda ke bayaan se vipakshi dal santusht dikhaai nahin the
 Opposition parties said that despite the decline in crude oil prices by more than fifty percent in international markets, the central government has been hesitant to reduce petroleum prices in the country

 bhartiya cricket team mangalvaar ko england ke saath khelte hue apane kharaab daur ko peeche chhod kar 'shubh vakt' main jeet ke safar kaa shubharambh karnaa chaahegi
 The Indian team is trailing 0–1 in the five-match ODI series
 kochi main vah jeet ke saath nai shuruyaat kar paaegi yaa nahin, yah to vakt hi batayega lekin beetaa ek maheenaa bharat ke liye behad kharaab rahaa he
 He lost in the Test series to England and then lost the ODI series to Pakistan
 rajkot main bharat ne 326 ranon ke vishaal lakshya kaa peechha karte hue 316 ran banaae the
 The match was important in many respects
 bade lakshya kaa peechha karte hue jeet ke itane kareeb pahunchakar usase maharoom rah janaa kharaab vakt kii ore ishaara karata he
 Now that Kharmas has passed, India faces new challenges
 use australia ke saath hone vaali gharelu test shrinkhalaa se pehle khud ko sanbhaalanaa hoga or iske liye use english team par jeet hasil kerani hogi
 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will have to avoid the mistakes he made in Rajkot
 shandaar form main chal rahe cheteshwar pujaara ko antim ekadash main shaamil nahin karnaa dhoni ke liye aalochana kaa kaaran bana tha
 Dhoni could have included Pujara in the squad in place of Ravindra Jadeja but Jadeja, who performed all-round against Pakistan in the last match, got the confidence of the captain and thus India had to go without a good in-form batsman
 
 dhoni ke liye yah vakt kharaab he
 There was a time when everything he used to touch would become gold, but today things have changed
 ek vakt aisa tha, jab dhoni ke galat faisle bhi sahi sabit ho jaaya karte the lekin aaj unke kai sahi faisle bhi galat sabit ho jaaya karte hai
 In such a situation, Dhoni should intentionally inspire his teammates to play well while avoiding any stubbornness or mistake
 yah team ke liye zyada jaruri he kyonki sachin tendulkar or virendra sahvaag ke bagaiyr team vaise bhi kamjor padati dikhaai de rahi he
 Moreover, the openers have not been able to give a good start on one occasion since last year
 team main pradarshan ke santulan kaa abhaav he
 That is why when bowlers do well, the batsmen flop and when the batsmen shine, the bowlers spoil the work
 rajkot main england ke teen ballebaajon ne 100 se adhik ausat se ran banaae the or bharat ke chaar ballebaaj isse adhik ausat se banane main safal rahe the lekin iske baavjood team haar gai thi
 The reason is simple, Indian batsmen will have to stay on the wicket for some more time
 yahi haal gendbaajon kaa he
 Ishant Sharma bowled brilliantly in the third match against Pakistan in Delhi but his 10-over quota at Rajkot scored 86 runs
 strike gendbaaj hone ke naate ishanth ko apane pradarshan main nirantarata lani hogi
 On the other hand, the English team has very few concerns with India
 uske ballebaaj acchhee lay main hai or gendbaaj bakhubi apana kaam kar rahe hai
 Despite losing two practice matches before the one-day series, the English team did not let their impact come on their performance
 captain elister cook dwaara ian bel ko salaami ballebaaj ke taur par aajmaana team ke liye nai urja ke sanchaar kaa kaaran bana he
 Bell has scored a century and a half-century since two practice matches
 eon morgan, craig keeswaitor or kevin petersan ke rup main uske paas achche or form main chal rahe ballebaaj hai, jo behad tej gati se ran banane kii kshamta rakhte hai
 They have all proved this in Rajkot
 kochi kii pich kya gul khilaaegi yah kahana mushkil he lekin itnaa jarur he ki english team bharat main beeti do shrinkhalaaon main mili 5-0, 5-0 kii haar kaa hisaab baraabar karne ko utaaru he or bharat ke in halaaton main use roak paanaa behad mushkil hoga

 Preparations for Operation Sundown had started several months ago, in fact, preparations were made by the army to chase Bhindranwale from Golden Temple since 1983

 yahaan dekhen bhartee kaa puraa notification The Intelligence Bureau has issued an alert regarding the 'minor' conviction of the 2012 Nirbhaya incident

 The convict was released from a child improvement home in December last year
 is babat uttar pradesh main uske grih jile badaayun prashasan ko bhi alert kar diya gaya he
 Significantly, this convict of Hanirbhaya was released six months before the completion of his sentence
 16 disambar 2012 kii raat chah darindon ne rashtriya rajdhani main nirbhaya jyoti singh ke saath chalati bas main gangrape kiya tha
 During this, the bestiality was carried out to the extent of vandalism with him, due to which Jyoti lost her life despite long treatment
 sudhaar grih main ek saal tak kashmiri yuvak ke saath tha doshikhufia agency ke adhikari bataate hai, 'hamane haal hi kuch gatividhiyon ko notice kiya or sthaneey prashasan ko is bare main jaankaree di
 The IB says Nirbhaya's conviction at the Baal reform home was with a Kashmiri boy who was involved in the 2011 Delhi High Court bomb threats
 donon kareeb ek saal tak ek hi kamare main rahe the
 It is said that during this time, the Kashmiri youth had told him about the problem of Kashmiris and had heard the stories and motivated them to raise their voice for the Kashmiris
 doshi kii 'kattar' vichaardhaara par uthe the sawaldusri ore, ibi ke alert ke baad badaayun police ke senior supretendent sunil saxena kehete hai, 'is bare main koi khaas input nahin he, lekin jis bhi tarah kii madad kii jarurat hogi, ham muhaiyaa karavaaenge

 yahi nahin, khud doshi ne is baat kii ashanka jaahir kii thi ki agar use reeha kiya jaataa he to uski hatya ho sakati he
 The IB had expressed the objection in its report
 The IB had written in its report before the convict's release that his proximity to the Kashmiri youth reinforces the possibility that he has been brainwashed
 yahi nahin, report main yah bhi kaha gaya ki doshi ko jihadiyon se judane or kashmiriyon ke liye ladane ko prerit kiya gaya
 However, after this, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Home Affairs, the convict was counseled so that his fundamental instinct could be ended

 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle madhya pradesh main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (RSS) ko lekar sargharmiyaan tej hai
 The state Congress government has decided to remove security from the RSS headquarters in Bhopal, on which his own party veteran Digvijay Singh has questioned
 digvijay ne twit kar sangh karyaalay kii suraksha behaal karne kii apil kii he
 In fact, late Monday night, the Kamal Nath government has said to remove security from the RSS office in Bhopal
 der raat vahaan se suraksha hatana bhi shuru ho gai
 The Sangh's office in Bhopal is the center of the entire Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 aise main bhopal seat se hi congress ke loksabhaa pratyaashee digvijay singh ne is par aapatti darj karvaa di
 Digvijay tweeted, "it is absolutely not appropriate to remove security from the office of Bhopal Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, i request Chief Minister Kamal Nath Ji to immediately give orders to provide adequate security"
 bhopal rashtriya swayan sevak sangh karyaalay se suraksha hataanaa bilkul uchit nahin he main mukhya mantri camel nath ji se anurodh karata hoon ki tatkaal pun: paryaapt suraksha dene ke aadesh den
 - digvijaya singh (@ digvijaya_28) April 2, 2019 Let us know that both Chief Minister Kamal Nath and Digvijay Singh have been critics of the Sangh in the past, so now this step of Digvijay before the Lok Sabha elections is shocking
 bhartiya janata party bhi bhadkimadhyapradesh vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh gopal bhargav ne samidha se suraksha hathaaye jane par kadi pratikriya dete hue twit kiya he ki 'bhopal sthit rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke karyaalay se suraksha kaa hataaya janaa @officeofknath kaa behad hi nindaneey kadam he
 An attack is probably planned by @INCMP again, if a volunteer gets scratched, the Congress government will be brushed with brick '

 What do they think the Sangh will get scared! The Sangh neither stops nor bends, even if a volunteer gets scratched, understand what will happen
 kyon khaas he bhopal sangh mukhyalay?aapako bataa den ki bhopal sthit sangh karyaalay samidha madhya kshetra kaa mukhyalay he jahaan aresas kii madhya praant kii mahatvapurn baithken hoti hai or jisamen sangh se jude tamaam mahatvapurn log shaamil hote hai or saath hi bijepi ke kai bade netaaon kaa yahaan aana-janaa laga rahata he
 As Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has also come here many times, but from 2009-2010, the SAF jawans stationed outside Samidha were removed late night on Monday
 haalanki javaanon ko kyon hataaya gaya isapar abhi sarkaar yaa police kii taraf se koi bayaan nahin aayaa he or naa hi sangh kii taraf se koi pratikriya lekin bijepi ne kamalnath sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha khol diya he
 Kamal Nath has been making sharp remarks about the Sangh before it formed the government and after the formation of the government, on which he also had a confrontation with the BJP leadership

 Union Home Secretary R
 ke
 Singh has criticized Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's Sarsangh Chalak Mohan Bhagwat for his remarks in which he said that westernization in Indian cities is the cause of increasing crime
 singh ne kaha ki mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadhon ke maamle main gramin or shahari bharat ke bich fark karne kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 On the sidelines of a program here, Home Secretary, Singh said that there is no basis to tell the difference between India and India
 gyaat ho ki bhagwat ne assam main kaha tha ki bharat main dushkarm jaise aparaadh kadaachit hi ghatate hai, lekin india main aise aparaadh lagaataar ghatate rahete hai
 Bhagwat had told a gathering of RSS workers in Silchar, Assam, that you go to the villages and forests of the country, there will not be such incidents of gang rape or sexual offenses
 ye ghatnaayen kuch shahari ilaakon main dhadlle se ghat rahi hai
 Apart from the new laws, Indian ethos and attitude towards women should be reviewed in the context of ancient Indian values
 bhagwat kii yah vivaadaaspad tippanee aise samay main saamne ai he, jab 16 disambar kii raat rashtriya rajdhani dilli main ek chalati bas main 23 varshiya yuvati ke saath chah darindon ne samuhik dushkarm kiya tha, or uski va uske purush mitra kii berahami se pitayee kii thi

 The forty-five member Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) reformed its rules to allow civil nuclear trade with India
 is tarah 1974 main bharat ke parmaanu pareekshan ke baad uske saath 34 saal se chalaa aa rahaa parmaanu bhedbhaav khatm hua
 After India's success in Vienna, External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee, who played a key role in the indo-us nuclear deal, spoke on managing editor Raja Chengapp and senior editor Saurabh Shuklase on India's nuclear future
 uske anshaneuclear saplir group kaa pratibandh hataanaa kitna mahatvapurn he?yah hamaare parmaanu asprishyata ke daur kaa ant he
 After the 1974 nuclear test, we faced tough restrictions
 hamaare parmaanu vaigyanikon ko antarrashtriya seminaron main bhaag lene kii ijaajat bhi nahin thi
 With the NSG ban lifted, we have got a passport to do civil nuclear trade with other countries
 yah bharat kii khaas ahmiyat or parmaanu aprasar ke maamle main uske saaf-suthere record kaa sweekaar he
 The international community is confident that this civil nuclear cooperation is good for India and also for the world
 kya enesji kaa pratibandh hataanaa utana hi saaf-suthra or bina kisi shart kaa he, jitna ki pesh kiya ja rahaa he?saaf-suthra or bina kisi shart, lagbhag ek hi baat he
 We have not accepted any unacceptable condition, nor have any of our Lakshman Rekha been violated
 hamen saaf-suthri chhot mili he
 For example, we did not want any condition imposed on us that we would not be allowed to do any tests
 ham baar-baar yah kehete rahe hai ki ham swechha se hi parmaanu pareekshan nahin karenge, ham ise sandhi sharton kii baadhyataa nahin bananaa chaahate
 The NSG has accepted our position
 unhone ham par parmaanu pareekshan kaa pratibandh nahin lagaaya lekin iskaa yah arth nahin ki unhone hamen aisa karne kii ijaajat de di he
 If we have the right to do something, then they have to react
 or ham kuch karte hai to hamen uske parinaamon ko bhi bhugatne ko taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 Has China's attitude disappointed you? If China had not been part of the consensus, there would have been no consensus in the NSG
 yah to sidhi-si baat he
 In the early stages, his actions were part of the normal decision process
 lekin rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar kaa kahana tha ki ve hataash the
 Such statements would have been made
 main jo kah rahaa hum, vah sarkaar kii niti he
 i liked what the Chinese Foreign Minister said that deeds speak more than words
 or unke kaaryon ne sabit kar diya ki ve sarvasammati kaa hissaa the
 But there is no consensus on the agreement so far in our country
 bhaajapa or vampanthi, donon hi aap par desh ko bech dene kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 i cannot say how many times i have sold the country
 '80 ke dashak main vitt mantri ke rup main maine iemef se paisa udhaar liya to vipaksh kaa kahana tha ki maine apane desh kii aarthik prabhusatta bech di
 The same accusation came when i signed the WTO in the '90s
 haal hi main raksha mantri ke rup main mujh par aise hi aarope lage jab maine america ke saath samjhaute ke masaude par hastakshar kiye
 After all, how many times a thing can be sold? BJP says that we have lost our right to conduct nuclear tests
 or hamaare ranneetik vikalpon ko bhi simit kiya ja rahaa he
 He has to explain to the nation why he said after 1998 that India does not need any further tests
 kyon? aisa ekatarfa nishedh ghoshit karne kii vajah? meraa kahana yah he ki yadi hamen 1998 main pareekshan kaa adhikaar tha, to ab bhi he
 At that time, we had to face some consequences for exercising our authority
 vaisaa phir bhi ho saktaa he
 There is no change in the situation
 koi samjhauta nahin kiya gaya he, yah bebuniyaad aalochana he
 The Left parties want to call a special session of Parliament
 parmaanu qaraar par america congress ke sadsy harvard burman ke patr li karne ke baad ve sarkaar par jhooth bolne kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 What is the lie? If i know anything and i have not told the truth, it is a lie, but how can i know what happened between the American executive and the legislature in this case? Our concern is with the one in which we are involved, such as the 123 Agreement and the rest
 so, is aarope kaa aadhaar kya he?jo nae parmaanu riector banaae ja rahe hai unke liye eendhan aapurti aashwaasan ke kya mudde uthaae ja rahe hai?123 samjhaute main jo kuch praavdhaan hai, usee ke aadhaar par iskaa akalan karnaa he
 As i said, lifting the ban is just a passport
 vija to dwipaksheeya samjhauta hoga, jo ham enesji ke un deshon ke saath karenge, jinke saath parmaanu vyapaar karnaa he
 You said that India would wait for the completion of the US agreement before starting nuclear trade with other NSG countries
 maine jo kaha tha, vah isse alag tha
 i said that the 123 Agreement is not complete until the US Congress approves it
 to hamen is prakriya ke puure hone tak intjaar karnaa hoga
 Only then can we do nuclear trade with America
 siddhant rup main to duusare deshon ke saath qaraar karne se koi bhi nahin roak saktaa
 So we can compromise with other countries like France and Russia? Of course we can do nuclear trade with other countries to start work
 or ham jald hi aisa karnaa chahenge
 Will you amend the Domestic Atomic Energy Act to allow private companies to trade nuclear? It is too early to say
 vartmaan manyata to yah he ki sarkaar parmaanu urja ayog ke jariye vyapaar karegi
 Right now i cannot say what will happen after the general election and when will the new government be formed? What will happen to our nuclear weapons program? The concept of nuclear doctrine was developed by the Vajpayee government and we are following it
 ham apane kaarykram ko na badha rahe hai, na gata rahe hai
 We must have minimum credible nuclear security so that no one attacks us with nuclear weapons because they should know that our counter attack will not be valid
 ham parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa jakhira jamaa karne yaa parmaanu hathiyaaron kii daud main shaamil hone ke icchhuk nahin hai
 You were disappointed at not being able to reach a consensus on the nuclear deal and preventing the Left from going out of the UPA? It was difficult
 unke matbhed saidhantik the
 They told us that we can enter into agreements with France and Russia but not with America
 main unki saidhantik avadharana nahin badal saktaa
 And no agreement with Russia and France was possible without the approval of the NSG
