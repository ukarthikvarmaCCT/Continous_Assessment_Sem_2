 vahinengiti yah faisla sunaate hue kaha ki kuch mandiron me baat karne kii manaahi he or vahaan par silence jone he, jaise bahaai mandir, tirupati or akshardham main
 At Amarnath, the risk of landslide increases due to the sound
 aise main engiti ke anusaar paryaavaran kii drushti se behad samvedansheel hone or ilaake main glaciaron kii samvedansheeltaa ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yahaan shor-sharaaba nahin hona chahie or yatriyon kii sankhya bhi simit honi chahie
 Advocate Aditya Singhala, who petitioned the NGT, told Aaj Tak that the NGT has given this order in view of its ecological structure, so that the incidence of land sliding does not increase
 jab ek saath sainkadon log ghantia bajaate he yaa phir jayakaare lagaate he to vahaan ke paryaavaran ko nuksaan hota he
 Let me tell you that last month, the NGT reprimanded the Amarnath Shrine Board for not providing adequate infrastructure to the devotees and not submitting a status report in the first week of December
 amarnath shrin board ko fatkaar lagane ke baad hi engiti kii ore se yeadesh jari kiya gaya he
 The NGT said in the order that the Shrine Board should decide that people should go in the same line from the last check post to the Amarnath cave
 engiti ne kaha ki shrin board is baat kii vyavastha kare ki yatri apana saamaan surakshit rup se rakh sakehaalanki is faisle par vivaad bhi ho gaya he
 The BJP government termed this decision against the Hindus
 bijepi ke dilli pradesh ke pravaktaa tejinder paal bagga ne kaha ki vah amarnath yatra par jaaenge or bam bam bhole or har har mahadev kaa jayakaara lagaayenge
 If there is courage in NGT, stop them
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle engiti ne aadesh jari karte hue mata vaishno devi main ek din main sirf 50 hajaar yatri hi darshan karne ke nirdesh die the
 Vaishno Devi Shrine Board had approached the Supreme Court against the order of the NGT
 jiske baad supreme court ne engiti ke aadesh par roak laga di thi

 maharashtra sarkaar kii baagh bachaao muhim ko in dinon ajeeb chunauti kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 The question before the government is, after all, who should make the face of this campaign? Because after Big B, now master blaster Sachin Tendulkar also wants to contribute in this
 maharashtra ke vanmantri sudhir munghantiwar kii taraf se seve-da-tiger muhim ke liye abhinayta amitabh bachchan or cricket khilaadi sachin tendulkar se aagrah kiya gaya tha
 Responding immediately to the government request, Big b had also accepted the offer on August 10, in honor of which the Forest Minister went to Big B's house and made him a tiger ambassador
 tippaniyan After this, on 13 August, Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar also wrote a letter to the Forest Minister, expressing his desire to join this mission
 ek muhim ke liye do bade logon se hami milane par ab sarkaar ke pasopesh main he ki tendulkar ke liye akhir koun si zimmedaari ko tay karen
 After all, there cannot be two brand ambassadors in a campaign
 is pench se rasta nikaalane ke liye sarkaar yah soch rahi he ki bharataratna sachin tendulkar ko rajya ke jangalon ko bachaane kii muhim kaa ambesder banaaya jaae
 But, the Forest Minister himself can meet Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar before taking a decision

 After agreeing to two big people for a campaign, it is now in the government's decision to decide which responsibility for Tendulkar

 To find a way out of this screw, the government is thinking that Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar should be made an ambassador of the campaign to save the forests of the state

 Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor's fitness and his energy level still surprise people
 iske peeche vajah he unka routine or behad sadhi hui diet
 However, sometimes people get confused about their habits
 aisa hi kuch shooting set par actress tiska chopra ke saath hua
 The story came to light when Anil Kapoor was sitting with director Anees Bazmee at the 'director Actor' session at the International Film Festival of India
 is seshan ko tiska chopra modrate kar rahi thim
 When Tisca recalled the shooting days of the TV series 24, an old story came to the fore when Anil Kapoor was offered a biscuit by Spotboy
 baat tab kii he jab anil or tiska raat ke 2 baje ek aspataal ke bheetar kaa seen shoot kar rahe the
 Everyone was tired and Anil Kapoor was the only one who was seen in full enthusiasm
 tiska ne bataaya ki anil sabakaa energy level hai rakhane kii koshish kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, a spotboy brought some biscuits which he offered to some of them and some to Anil Kapoor

 usee vakt anil kapur ne yahaan unhen tokaa or kaha ki ye darasal diet kii vajah se nahin he balki aadaton kii vajah se he
 Anil Kapoor explained the reason: Anil Kapoor said that as an actor he has been trained to eat only in the breaks

 On October 13, at the Jhulelal Park on the banks of Gomti in Lucknow, a large crowd of backward fraternities inside the Muslims was conveying the ongoing contradiction in the Muslim society
 iske ek taraf saamaajik-aarthik rup se kamjor mansuri, kuraishi, idarisi, rhini jaisi 36 birdariyaan hai to duusari taraf shaikh, saiyad, pathan or shiya ke rup main agade phirake hai
 Since 85 percent of the Muslims belong to backward fraternities, political parties engaged in multiplication of votes have turned their eyes on them
 beete maah mukhyamantri mayawati ne jab muslim samaaj ko uski aabaadi ke hisaab se aarakshan dene kii maang karte hue pradhanmantri ko patr bheja to spasht ho gaya ki aagaamee chunaav main uske mudde beete chunaavon se itar honge
 This was not Mayawati's first attempt to increase the bsp's support base among Muslims by demanding reservation
 iske alaava mayawati ne party ke varisht netaa nasimuddin siddiki ko musalamaanon se jodne kaa jimmaa saunpa he
 Party leaders are arguing strongly that there was not a single communal riot in the state during the tenure of the BSP government
 rajya main muslim aabaadi 18
 5 percent
 70 vidhansabha kshetron main unki sankhya 20 pratishat yaa isse adhik he
 Muslim voters are between 30-45 percent in 20 seats in western Uttar Pradesh, 10 in eastern Uttar Pradesh, 5 in central and one seat in Bundelkhand
 aise main musalamaanon ko basapa kii ore khinchne kii kavayad se sabase zyada kasamasaahat sapa ko hi hui
 After the demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992, it remained the favorite party of Muslims for a decade and a half
 beete loksabhaa chunaav main musalamaanon kaa sapa ke prati jhukaav kuch kamjor hua to agle vidhansabha chunaav main ise durust karne kii garaj se sapa ne bhi apni taiyaariyaan shuru kar di hai
 Senior party leader Mohammad Azam Khan calls the Congress government at the Center an enemy of Muslims, and raises questions to the BSP: "who should stop the Chief Minister Mayawati demanding Muslim reservation?" The party has said to provide reservation to Muslims on forming a government and open schools and colleges in Muslim-dominated areas
 par sapa main jis tarah rajyasabha saansad kaaji rashid masood or ajam khan ke bich jang chhidi he usase muslim matadaata agle vidhansabha chunaav main party se or dur ho jaaen to aashcharya nahin hoga
 In the 2007 assembly elections, SP got 46 percent Muslim votes but after two years in Lok Sabha elections this figure was reduced to 30 percent
 is baar aarakshan ke mudde par musalmaan chunki ekajute hote dikh rahe hai to bhaajapa bhi unhen apni ore laane kii bharsak koshish main jute gai he
 In the last 20 years, the party has not been able to get any Muslim candidate to cross the threshold of the state assembly
 uske liye raahat kii baat yah he ki 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaav main jahaan 2 fisadi musalamaanon ne bhaajapa ko vot die the, vahiin loksabhaa main yah aankada badhkar 6 fisadi pahunch gaya tha
 Recently, excited by the crowd gathered at the Minority Swabhiman Sammelan in Lucknow, the BJP is asserting its claim on at least 10 percent of the vote of Muslims
 muslim maton ke maamle main beete loksabhaa chunaav main sabase phaayde main rahi congress abhi tak inke liye koi prabhavi agenda lekar saamne nahin aa pai he
 The party in the state is still completely dependent on Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi
 beete dinon unke netritv main pradesh congress kaa ek pratinidhimandal pradhanmantri se mila tha or bunakaron ke karje maaf karne kii maang kii thi
 On Wednesday, the last day of the Bundelkhand tour, Rahul Gandhi has tried to woo the minorities by spending the night at the home of a Muslim family
 asal main pradesh main congress ke paas koi muslim cheharaa nahin he
 Mohsina Kidwai is an old Muslim leader, Azharuddin, Zafar Ali Naqvi is the MP, Naseeb Pathan is the party leader in the Legislative Council but the party has put its claim on Muslim votes by giving MP Salman Khurshid the status of Cabinet Minister at the Center
 tikat bantwaare main uljhi party ne abhi tak alpsankhyakon ko jodne ke liye ek bhi bade samaaroh kaa aayojan nahin kiya he
 This time it will not be easy for big parties to get Muslim votes
 isaki vajahen bhi hai
 Backward groups of Muslims are now not only coming together, but leadership is also emerging from within
 isi varg ke dow
 Muhammad Ayub and his Peace Party can be seen from this perspective
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main pehali baar shirkat karne vaali pis party ne 21 sansadeey kshetron main apane pratyaashee utaare the
 Though none of its candidates emerged victorious but the party drew everyone's attention by getting 4 percent votes
 beete loksabhaa chunaav main azamgarh or jonpur main apni takat dikhaa chuki rashtriya ulema council bhi is dfa pehali baar vidhansabha chunaav main utar rahi he
 The party is constantly raising the worsening condition of the minorities, but its fight is also to get the Muslims their identity
 gaiyr raajnneetik sanghathan rashtriya pasmanda muslim samaaj ke binar tale baari sankhya main jhulelaal park main jute pichde musalamaanon ne yah sandesh dene kii koshish kii ki pichde alpsankhyakon kii raajnneeti ab unheen ke bich ke log karenge
 "the backward Muslims have not got representation on any platform according to their population," says Anees Mansoori, the national president of the society
 yadi unhen satta main paryaapt bhagidaari mil jaae to ve apane aap hi tarakkee kar jaaenge
 Now 15 per cent forward castes of Muslims cannot lead 85 per cent backward castes
 ''iske alaava dow

 Sheikh's underprivileged Samaj Insaaf Party and Afzal Ansari's Qaumi Ekta Dal will also be in the fray for the first time
 front ke adhyaksh moulana abdul badaruddin ne ghoshnaa kii he ki unki party rajya ke sabhi 403 kshetron main chunaav ladegi
 The next assembly election will also be important in this sense as it will also include the young voters who were born after the communal frenzy erupted after the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition
 spasht he ki is baar muslim matadaataaon ke sarokaar badal gaye hai
 Now they are not going to fly in the storm of emotion
 in matadaataaon ko apana haq chahie
 Muslims, who are facing the brunt of backwardness, now want to get rid of it
 samaaj main ek sthaan paane ke liye ve aarakshan kii maang kar rahe hai
 They are no longer the tag of any party, but all of them are examining the party and the leaders, perhaps it is from them that they get their 'ambedkar'

 Jai Bhagwan said that he has an old relationship with the Congress, but now that his son-in-law is contesting the election himself, he cannot oppose him under any circumstances

 Even seeing Bharat Ratna did not honor him

 Jaya Bachchan said till date that i am very disappointed

 i tried several times to have his maiden speech, let him speak
 sachin ek bada naam he or unhone desh kaa naam vishwa main roshan kiya he

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi was seen in a very spiritual sense at Ujjain Simhastha Kumbh on Saturday
 vaicharik mahakumbh main piem ne desh kii behatari ke liye parampara se judane or aadhyatm ke jariye swayan ke vikaas par jor diya
 8 key points of pm's speech
 
 
 1
 The importance of knowledge will always be there and it will continue to show direction to society in every age
 2
 Kumbha is part of our tradition
 yahaan se samaaj kii disha or badlaav kii disha tay hoti he
 3
 pehle log kumbh ke meley main tay hui disha ko lekar jate the or samaaj main badlaav ke liye kaam karte the
 Today again a similar effort is needed
 4
 Traditions have changed in the absence of time, but we have to understand the importance of our roots and values
 5
 We have grown up in the principles where the body comes and goes, but we do not allow the soul to become a slave of time
 6
 Shastri ji used to call people to eat food at one time and people obeyed
 maine bhi alpiji sabsidi chhodane kii apil kii, to ek karod se adhik logon ne janaseva ke liye tyaag diya
 Our tradition is like this
 7
 People who work selflessly for the society, whether in saffron or not, are power for the society
 8
 Confrontation is not the solution to any problem
 hamen apane andar jhaankna hoga or mulyon tathaa paramparaon ke jariye samasyaon kaa hal khojna hoga

 bhartiya upmahadweep ke jin rachanakaaron ne apni rachanashiltaa ke aashyon ke kaaran vaishvik str par charchaa pai he unamem bangladeshi mul kii tasalima nasrin khaasi ullekhneey hai
 Not only did she have to endure the tragedy of relentless exile after immense suffering and traumas, due to the lingering rebellion she had become synonymous with in her lifestyle and writing, but permanently confessing her captive life in the 'house of privacy' But despite all the unimaginable and harsh conditions on the physical plane, the difference in the showdown is the difference of a woman who craves complete liberation What is indomitable and important is that the concerns within their longing are bound by the widest expansion of social systems and morality
 tasalima nasrin kaa hindi main prakashit nayaa kavita sankalan 'mujhe dena or prem' unke asaamaanya jivan or teevr aaveg-yukt anubhavon ko vyakt karne vaala dastavej he
 Taslima's life journey can be clearly seen in this compilation in such a way that her rebellion and struggle are instilled with natural and natural love
 tasalima kaa prem utkar or uddaam he
 Agadh and Achor
 yah prem tamaam varjanaaon, manyataon or prachlit dharanaon kii dhajjiyaan udaata apni raah badhata he
 This unique incessant love of Taslima is highly complex and polymorphic in which there is a vast world with a thousand colors and shades
 is sansar main pravesh karte hue tasalima naam kii ek aisi hathi stri se saakshaatkaar hota he, jiske hriday main sagar kii ucchhaltaa basii he or aaveg-samveg kaa uskaa sansar maatr apane sukh-dukh kaa nahin he, varan usamen sari maanavtaa ke dukh-dwandv dhadak rahe hai
 This is why the first verse of this compilation of mostly love poems is about a brick-breaking girl, who gets 10 rupees for breaking bricks all day
 milte hai
 With the same 10 rupees, his family of seven people has to be silent
 ladki kii bagal main thodi hi dur par ek chhatari kii chhaanv tale baithe purush majdoor ko isi kaam ke liye 20 ru
 See you yahaan langik asamanta kii kuriti par tasalima sahaj hi ungali rakh detii hai
 In the latter part of the poem we find the legend of the girl's unfulfilled desires and the end of the poem on a compassion note that 'all the pain was / do not touch her anymore
 'darasal, tasalima ke yahaan sangyeya yatharth kii kuch sidhi-saadi shreniyan hai
 There is a large range of miseries, including Taslima, apart from her personal frustrations and sorrows, and many other sorrows she gives her rightful place
 aise dukhon main vanchit-shoshit jan kii pidaa, america samrajyavad dwaara barbar sainya bal se rond daale gaye deshon kii kaarunikta, 1947 ke bharat vibhaajan kaa asweekaarya dansh or apni divangat maa kii marmavedi smriti jaise vividh vishay hai jinke jariye vah amarsh ko vaani detii hai
 In any language literature such poems are like permanent funds
 dukhon kii ye tamaam kismein or unki yah shrenee tasalima ke liye prem kaa nrushans pratilom he, jis prem se unki aatma nirmit he
 The unique method of counteracting grief is also in Taslima's psycho-love world
 avsaad, kaatarata, vihvalata, paraajay or mohabhang ko vah jas kaa tas kubul karti hai lekin unke prem kii aparajeyata akshunn rahati he, kyonki vah sarvasv dekar apane 'premic' ko samgr paanaa chaahati hai or apni pratiti main akasar paati bhi hai
 This expression is expressed in small poems of the Vibration series
 or yah bhi gauratlab he ki tasalima kaa 'premic' unke bhavajagat main itnaa ashariri-sa vistaar bhi paa letaa he ki vah asang bhav se kah sakati hai, 'mere prem main hi he sukh meraa / vah mujhako chaahe na chaahe' yaa prem ke vilom ko sweekaarti hui beparwaah kahati hai, ''tumhen dukh dena acha lagata he, do
 "in these love poems of Taslima, the very personal way of love has developed in a very rare way -" There is no age to love
 ' ve naseehat ke andaaj main bataati hai, 'jaise ki solah main vaise hi saath main / bah sakati he prem dhara' or 'bachanaa kavita main' 'premic', ko kahati hai, 'kaise yah soch liya tumne ki umr tumhen / legi bachaa prem se
 Age will not save you from my love / Love will save you from age
 ' or phir 'aao idhar, achche bachche kii tarah, mere paas / meraa prem lo
 'like love-loving eyes, these poems of Taslima are very sensitive and memorialized, it is also possible that some new questions and point of view will arise from them in the contemporary female discourse of Hindi
 nirvaasan kii antaheen pidaa jhelti tasalima ne purush prabhutavaad ke vibhatsatam aakraamakon kaa saamana kiya he
 In spite of this, he has carved a natural pair of men and women and the infinite dreams of love and the sensuous and surreal images of him, are undoubtedly sparse and eccentric
 prem tasalima ke liye unka mahasvapn he
 Some of the poems in this compilation ‚Äî'akavita ',' We used to go when the mother suffered, '' Seagull of the Mediterranean Sea, '' From this house to that house ',' Nay, '"america" ‚Äîsuch , Whose superiority deserves detailed discussion

 kya 1993 dhamaakon kaa doshi yaqub pakadaa gaya tha? agar nahin to phir usne sarender kaise, kab or kahaan kiya? aane vaale vakt main supreme court jo bhi faisla legaa usamen puraa maamla in do sawaalon par aakar jarur atakegaa
 The former RAW official's article indicates that Yakub was brought under a 'deal'
 aisi deal jiske bare main yaa to khufia agenciyaan jaanati hai yaa phir yaqub or uskaa parivaar
 This is the screw that raises the most intriguing questions in the entire story
 tark ke khatir maan len ki yaqub ko sibiai ne dilli stesan se pakadaa tha, to phir ajtak agenciyaan ye kyon nahin bataa pai ki stesan par pakadaney ke pehle yaqub kahaan rahata tha
 If he was in India then who were the people who sheltered? It is obvious that there was nothing like this or else the debate did not arise
 to tark ke aadhaar par ye saaf he ki yaqub kii dilli main giraftaar ke pehle hi wo police kii pakad main tha
 Those who know the functioning and modalities of the agencies know that it is very common that an accused is arrested anywhere he is arrested and the police informs him of his convenience
 yaqub kaa parivaar kahata rahaa he ki usne kathmandu main sarender kiya tha
 
 
 That is, all the activities have taken place in Nepal itself
 tark ke khatir maan len ki nepal main hi giraftaar hui he to phir sawaal uthte hai ki yaqub vahaan tak pakistan se pahunchaa kaise? or pahunchaa bhi to pakadaa kaise gaya? yaqub kii kahani main or bade pench tab dikhte hai jab ye samaj aana band ho jaataa he ki agar yaqub kii giraftaar hui thi or wo taiyaar nahin tha to is sabake baad bhi uskaa parivaar kaise waapas aa gaya? kyon saare log laut aaye? kya unhen nahin pataa tha ki yaqub ko kaise giraftaar kiya gaya he? agar pataa tha to wo sab khud ko khatre main daal kar kyon laute? Let's assume for a while that our agencies tricked and captured Yakub and his family and later punished them
 ab bada sawaal uthta he ki yaqub ne shuru se hi ye kyon nahin bataaya ki usne sarender kiya he, pakadaa nahin gaya he? The answers to all these punches and questions are actually in the legal process
 1993 bam dhamaakon par faisla dene vaale jaj pidi kode kehete hai ki yaqub ne sarender kiya he, iske wo saboot pesh nahin kar sakaa
 The big question is, can someone present evidence after being arrested? The judge believes that the courts give the verdict based on evidence and statements and Yakub failed to prove his surrender, while the CBI was able to tell that he was arrested
 jaahir si baat he adaalat kaa isse lenaa dena nahin ho saktaa ki koun se saboot kathmandu main the or wo yaqub ke paas kaise nahin rah paae
 The comments aisa nahin he ki yaqub ne apane sarender kii baat jaj ko nahin bataai
 According to the judge, under Section 313 of the crpc, the accused has the right to speak even after the punishment and using this, Yakub spoke about his surrender
 lekin ye baat kisi shapath ke tahat nahin hoti isliye uskaa koi kanoonee mahatv nahin bachataa
 The story of the screw does not end here, everything that happened between the RAW officer and Yakub is outside the boundaries of the courts, so on the basis of this, Rahm's scope is less, so the question is whether Yakub will be saved from hanging
 From the trap tark ke khatir maan len ki yaqub ko sibiai ne dilli stesan se pakadaa tha, to phir ajtak agenciyaan ye kyon nahin bataa pai ki stesan par pakadaney ke pehle yaqub kahaan rahata tha
 If he was in India then who were the people who sheltered? It is obvious that there was nothing like this or else the debate did not arise
 to tark ke aadhaar par ye saaf he ki yaqub kii dilli main giraftaar ke pehle hi wo police kii pakad main tha
 Those who know the functioning and modalities of the agencies know that it is very common that an accused is arrested anywhere he is arrested and the police informs him of his convenience
 yaqub kaa parivaar kahata rahaa he ki usne kathmandu main sarender kiya tha
 
 
 That is, all the activities have taken place in Nepal itself
 tark ke khatir maan len ki nepal main hi giraftaar hui he to phir sawaal uthte hai ki yaqub vahaan tak pakistan se pahunchaa kaise? or pahunchaa bhi to pakadaa kaise gaya? yaqub kii kahani main or bade pench tab dikhte hai jab ye samaj aana band ho jaataa he ki agar yaqub kii giraftaar hui thi or wo taiyaar nahin tha to is sabake baad bhi uskaa parivaar kaise waapas aa gaya? kyon saare log laut aaye? kya unhen nahin pataa tha ki yaqub ko kaise giraftaar kiya gaya he? agar pataa tha to wo sab khud ko khatre main daal kar kyon laute? Let's assume for a while that our agencies tricked and captured Yakub and his family and later punished them
 ab bada sawaal uthta he ki yaqub ne shuru se hi ye kyon nahin bataaya ki usne sarender kiya he, pakadaa nahin gaya he? The answers to all these punches and questions are actually in the legal process
 1993 bam dhamaakon par faisla dene vaale jaj pidi kode kehete hai ki yaqub ne sarender kiya he, iske wo saboot pesh nahin kar sakaa
 The big question is, can someone present evidence after being arrested? The judge believes that the courts give the verdict based on evidence and statements and Yakub failed to prove his surrender, while the CBI was able to tell that he was arrested
 jaahir si baat he adaalat kaa isse lenaa dena nahin ho saktaa ki koun se saboot kathmandu main the or wo yaqub ke paas kaise nahin rah paae
 The comments aisa nahin he ki yaqub ne apane sarender kii baat jaj ko nahin bataai
 According to the judge, under Section 313 of the crpc, the accused has the right to speak even after the punishment and using this, Yakub spoke about his surrender
 lekin ye baat kisi shapath ke tahat nahin hoti isliye uskaa koi kanoonee mahatv nahin bachataa
 The story of the screw does not end here, everything that happened between the RAW officer and Yakub is outside the boundaries of the courts, so on the basis of this, Rahm's scope is less, so the question is whether Yakub will be saved from hanging
 From the trap yaqub kaa parivaar kahata rahaa he ki usne kathmandu main sarender kiya tha
 
 
 That is, all the activities have taken place in Nepal itself
 tark ke khatir maan len ki nepal main hi giraftaar hui he to phir sawaal uthte hai ki yaqub vahaan tak pakistan se pahunchaa kaise? or pahunchaa bhi to pakadaa kaise gaya? yaqub kii kahani main or bade pench tab dikhte hai jab ye samaj aana band ho jaataa he ki agar yaqub kii giraftaar hui thi or wo taiyaar nahin tha to is sabake baad bhi uskaa parivaar kaise waapas aa gaya? kyon saare log laut aaye? kya unhen nahin pataa tha ki yaqub ko kaise giraftaar kiya gaya he? agar pataa tha to wo sab khud ko khatre main daal kar kyon laute?

 From the trap chaliye kuch der ke liye maan lete hai ki hamaari agenciyon ne bargala kar yaqub or uske parivaar ko pakad liya or baad main unako sazaa dilaa di
 Now the big question arises that why did Jacob not tell from the beginning that he had surrendered, not caught? in tamaam pench or sawaalon ke jawaab darasal kanoonee prakriya main hai
 Judge PD Kode, who gave the verdict on the 1993 bomb blasts, says that Yakub has surrendered, he could not produce evidence
 bada sawaal he ki kya giraft main aane ke baad koi shaks saboot pesh kar saktaa he? jaj sahab kaa maananaa he ki adaalatein faisla saboot or bayanon ke aadhaar detii hai or yaqub naakaam rahaa khud ke sarender kii baat sabit karne main, jabaki sibiai ye bataa pai ki use giraftaar kiya he
 It is obvious that the court cannot have anything to do with which evidence was in Kathmandu and how they could not live with Yakub
 tippaniyan It is not that Yakub did not reveal his surrender to the judge
 jaj sahab ke mutabik siarpisi kii dhara 313 ke tahat mulgim ko sazaa ke baad bhi apni baat kehane kaa haq he or isi kaa istemaal karte hue yaqub ne apane sarender kii baat kahi
 But this is not done under any oath, so it has no legal significance
 pench kii kahani yaheen khatm nahin hoti, ro ke afasar or yaqub ke bich jo kuch hua tha, wo adaalaton kii seemaa ke baahar hua he isliye uske aadhaar par raham kii gunjaaish kam hoti he, aise main sawaal yahi ki kya yaqub batch paaegaa faansee ke fande se? The answers to all these punches and questions are actually in the legal process
 1993 bam dhamaakon par faisla dene vaale jaj pidi kode kehete hai ki yaqub ne sarender kiya he, iske wo saboot pesh nahin kar sakaa

 pakistan ke kanoon ke mutabik kisi party ko sarkaar banane ke liye uske paas kam se kam 137 siten honi chahie
 Elections were held in Pakistan on 25 July
 pitiai ne ravivaar ko kaha tha ki sarkaar banane ke liye vah chote dalon or nirdaleey saansadon ke sampark main hai
 According to this result, at first glance, it seems that the majority of Imran is 22 seats away
 lekin ganit inta saadhaaran nahin he, isamen ek pech he
 Some PTI leaders have emerged victorious in many seats and they can remain in only one seat
 jaise khud imran khan paanch seat par chunaav jite hai or unhen chaar siten chhodani hongi
 Pakistan Muslim league-nawaz (PML-N) has got 64 seats and Pakistan People's Party (PPP) has got 43 seats
 donon dal milakar pitiai sarkaar ko neshnal essembly main kadi takkar denge
 PTI has made it clear that it will not take the help of PML-N and PPP to form the government, so now Imran will have to resort to many small groups
 unhen saadhaaran bahumat hasil karne ke liye 137 siten chahie
 According to media reports, PTI leaders are in touch with the Muttahida Qaumi movement-pakistan (MQM-P) and several independents
 emcuam-pi ke paas chah siten hai
 The National Assembly has elected 13 independents
 pitiai netaaon ne sindh ke grand democratic alliance (jidie) se bhi samarthan ke liye sampark kiya he
 The GDA has two mps
 haalanki, abhi tak jidie ne samarthan kaa sanket nahin diya he

 The challenge before the family of Mohammad Akhlaq is that one of the false cases against him has not been framed in court even after 2 years and his family has not been given compensation in the case of Pehrom Khan
 muaavja to dur abhi unheen ke parivaar ke upar dobaaraa cese laga diya gaya he
 We have come here with a total of 5 such cases

 " Akhilak 's son Daanish , who was killed in Dadri, told Aaj Tak after meeting Rajnath Singh," Even today the incident comes in front of eyes
 main aaj pehali baar grahamantri se mila hum mujhe behad khushi he
 i still feel sad about this whole case and the whole case and i am also sad that the accused are out on bail and they have not been charged yet in 2 years
 isliye main kabhi ghar ke baahar akele nahin nikalataa
 When this incident happened, i was preparing for the competition, but now my studies have been badly affected
 grahamantrine mujhase kaha he ki ve sarkaar se baat karenge or mujhe ummid he ki vah kuch karenge

 This is the case with the daughter of Bihar that everyone knows
 unka chayan haarane ke liye kiya he
 You consider Bihar's daughter a loser
 jeetne ke samay chayan kiijie
 These things are not going to have much effect
 jab bhi koi chunaav hota he, log apni apni baat rakhenge
 Ramnath Kovind's name was first announced, from the ruling party

 Burari incident has become a puzzle for the whole country and the police does not seem to be getting cold
 mangalvaar ko ek agyaat shaks ne police ko chitthee likhakar chaunkaane vaala khulaasa kiya he
 An unknown person has written a letter to the police commissioner informing him about the contact between the Bhatia family and a tantrik
 ab tak kii jaanch main police ko mrit mili parivaar ke 11 sadasyon ke alaava kisi bahari vyakti yaa kisi tantric kaa haath hone kaa saboot to nahin mila he
 But this anonymous letter has again thrown a new screw in the Burari incident
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki police kamishnar ko yah anaam chitthee 3 july ko likhi gai he
 The man who wrote the letter says that in Burari, the family of 11 people who committed mass suicide by getting trapped in religious superstition, were in contact with a Baba from Delhi
 police ko likhi is anaam chitthee main kisi bidi vaale baba kaa zikr he
 The writer of the letter claims that the Bhatia family of Burari was supposed to come to this tantrik
 chitthee main bataaya gaya he ki dilli ke karaalaa main rahane vaale is tantric kaa asli naam chandraprakash pathak he
 Actually, this tantric named Chandraprakash Pathak is famous in the area of karala as Beedi Baba and Bearded Baba
 chitthee ke mutabik, bidi vaale baba apane aap ko hanuman kaa bhakt kahata he or shaam 6 baje tak jhaad phoonk karata he
 The wife of this Baba is also a tantric
 chitthee likhane vaale shaks ne daawa kiya he ki buraadi main bhaatia parivaar ke jin 11 sadasyon kii maut hui he unamem se kai logo ko isane baba ke paas jate hue dekha he
 In the letter, an appeal has been made to the police that Baba may be behind these deaths, so it should be investigated
 parivaar waalon ne khud jutaya tha maut kaa samanburadi cond main isse pehle jaanch ke dauraan police ko sisitivi footage se ahm suraag mili the
 According to the police, the clues found so far indicate that all the family members have voluntarily wished to attain salvation in chastity
 'aaj tak' kii team us dukaan tak ja pahunchi, jahaan se is parivaar ne apane liye maut kaa saamaan kharida tha
 That is to buy a dupatta and sardine for hanging
 inhen main se ek dupatta jo bhuwanesh ke gale me tha, wo buraadi ilaake kii hi ek dukaan se kharida gaya tha
 The woman, who identified the Maharoon colored dupatta around Bhuvanesh's neck, said that about 10 days before the incident, a girl (neetu) of the Bhatia family of glasses came to their shop and went to buy 1 or 2 dupattas
 krime branch kii team ne jab is mahila ko laashon ke gale me pade dupatton kii pahchaan karwaai to unhone bhuwanesh kii laash ke gale main pade marun rang ke dupattey kii pahchaan kar lee
 In Burari itself, the team of Crime Branch had reached the shop of Mahendra Pal, who runs a shoe shop named BK Shoes
 mahendra paal kaa kahana he ki 30 june yani shanivaar ko ghar kii beti jo chashma lagaati thi (nitu) or donon bachche (sivam or dhruv) shaam saadhe 7 or 8 baje ke bich dukaan par aae the
 He bought 2 pairs of school shoes
 800 rupe kaa bill tha ladki ne 500 rupee die or kaha ki baaki 300 rupee kal de jaaegi
 But the whole family died that night
 CCTV main bhi ghar ke teen log saaf dikhaai de rahe hai
 The police is involved in the investigation of the case
 CCTV footage police ke liye kaaphi ahm saboot he

 Moon about someone or something- Getting frustrated about something- Hey brother, there is nothing to be so disturbing in this
 Do not moon about it
 If you do not get it, you will get another job soon

 Promise the moon - Making big promises to someone that cannot be fulfilled - It is the habit of politicians during elections that they first talk about Promise the moon and then disappear
 8
 Over the moon- Very happy- When she presented me a bouquet of flowers and a cake, i was just Over the moon
 9
 Many moons ago- a long time ago- i do not even remember this thing, it is a matter of many moon ago

 Kamal Haasan called Nathuram Godse the first Hindu terrorist to be attacked by Bollywood actor Vivek Oberoi
 vivek obaroy twit kiya, 'priy camel sar, aap mahaan kalakaar hai
 Just as art does not have any religion, in the same way terrorism also has no religion! You could say that Godse was a terrorist, but would you characterize 'hindu' specifically? Is it because you were in a Muslim-majority area in search of votes? 'dear Kamal sir, you are a great artist
 Just like art has no religion, terror has no religion either! You can say Ghodse was a terrorist, why would you specify ‚Äòhindu‚Äô ? Is it because you were in a Muslim dominated area looking for votes?@ikamalhaasanhttps: / / t

 is brake ke dauraan vah enesdy kii claces le rahe the
 There, he told the students what he has learned or experienced from the film industry in so many years
 ek intervyuu ke dauraan manoj ne bataaya, ''mujhe kaam se brake lene kii jarurat thi jo meri routine life banati ja rahi thi
 And routine is something I've always disliked
 subah uthanaa, job ke liye nikalnaa or phir shaam ko ghar waapas aana
 To rebuild myself i really needed to focus on something else
 iske alaava main jo kar rahaa hum usase mere mind ko alag karnaa jaruri tha
 i think these 8-9 months were among the best moments of my life

 com / ciyhnd1ub0 comments kamjor monsoon kii vajah se desh ke 12 rajyon ke jalaashyon main pani kaa str ausat se neeche gir chukaa he or maharashtra se lekar tamilnadu tak kai bade rajya pani ke sankat se jujh rahe hai
 If the rains are decreasing, farmers are not getting the water required for sowing kharif crops
 nateeja, buaai kaa kshetra ghat gaya he
 According to the latest data of the Ministry of Agriculture, rice sowing 109 till July 12 last year
 88 lakh hectare main hui thi jo 2019 main 12 july tak ghatakar 97
 77 lakh hectare is left
 yani ab tak kamazor monsoon kii vajah se chaaval kii buaai 12
 11 lakh hectares has decreased
 yahi haal dalhan kii fasalon kaa bhi he
 Sowing of pulses crop till July 12 last year 45
 73 lakh hectare ilaake main hui thi jo 2019 main 12 july tak ghat kar 34
 22 lakh hectares is left, which is 11 sowing of pulses due to weak monsoon
 51 lakh hectare kam hui he
 Actually, if we look at the sowing of all kharif crops, then the decline gets bigger
 pichley saal ke mukaable 12 july 2019 ko kharif fasalon kii buaai 452
 413 reduced from 30 lakh hectares
 34 lakh hectare rah gai he
 That is 38
 96 lakh hectare kii giravat
 Water power minister Gajendra Shekhawat said the monsoon has come late
 is sankat se nipatane ke liye cabinet sachiv ne jila adhikariyon se video condorecing ke zarie halaat kaa gauge liya he
 BJP MP Jagdambika Pal said this time the monsoon is late
 dhan kii fasal kii buaai ke liye zyaada pani kii zarurat hoti he
 Where there is a water crisis in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala on one hand
 vahiin baadh main assam main kisaanon kii fasal barbaad hui hai
 Different floods have devastated large areas from Bihar to Assam
 rameshwar taili, saansad, assam- main kal apane sansadeey kshetra gaya tha
 There is a lot of crop loss of farmers
 
 
 main grih mantri se miloongaa or assam ke baadh-peediton ke liye or madad kii maang karuunga
 
 
 Assam's flood-affected farmers should be compensated for their losses
 har saal desh sookhe or baadh ke ye halaat jhelta he
 Obviously, a long strategy is needed keeping this in mind so that the farmer does not feel helpless in the face of natural beatings
 UNHRC main prastaav pesh karne kaa aakhri din thapakistan aavashyak samarthan hasil karne main asafal rahauntararashtriya manch par pakistan ek baar phir beizzat hua he
 Today was the last day for the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to propose a resolution on Kashmir, but Pakistan failed to garner the necessary support
 sutron ke mutabik zyaadaatar sadasyon ne kashmir par prastaav rakhane ke liye pakistan kaa samarthan karne se inkaar kar diya
 Actually, today was the last date to propose Kashmir, but Pakistan could not do so
 prastaav pesh karne ke liye kam se kam 16 deshon ke samarthan kii jarurat thi
 Pakistan, crying in front of different countries of the world, failed to garner support
 geneva main UNHRC kaa 42 waan satr chal rahaa he
 Sources told India Today that Pakistan also failed to garner minimum support
 kya kahata he niyamaniyam kahata he ki kisi bhi desh ke prastaav par karrwai karne se pehle nunatam samarthan kii jarurat hoti he
 Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi promised a proposal on Kashmir before leaving Islamabad for Geneva
 UNHRC main islamic sahyog sanghathan (oisi) ke 15 desh hai
 Pakistan hoped that it would gather support after this
 kashmir ke mudde par ek sanyukt bayaan ke prabandhan ke baad bhi islamabad vot nahin juta paaya
 Pakistan had earlier submitted a joint statement to the UNHRC on the condition of Kashmir on 10 September
 isamen usne 60 deshon ke samarthan kii baat kahi thi, lekin koun se desh samarthan kar rahe hai, isko wo nahin bataa paaya
 Pakistan had three options in the UNHRC with 47 members
 prastaav, bahes yaa to vishesh satr
 The proposal is now out of this option
 vishesh satr sabase majboot vikalp ho saktaa he, lekin use bhi khaarij kiya jaataa he
 According to sources, a special session cannot be held between the general session which will last till 27 September
 vahiin bahes ke liye kam se kam 24 deshon ke samarthan kii jarurat hoti he
 Both these options are there only in case of urgent need
 sutron ne kaha ki kashmir par maamla aath saptaah bitne ke baad bhi na to tatkaal jaruri he or na hi yah gambhir he kyonki bharat ne parishad or sadsy rajyon ko suchit kiya he ki sthiti niyantran main he or aashwaasan diya ki pratibandhon main dheel di jaaegi
 The first ODI between India and the West Indies in Chennai will be played in the first match of the three-match ODI series between India and West Indies at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai
 yah match kal yani ravivaar dopaher 1:30 baje se shuru hoga
 In the ODI series against the West Indies, India will be a strong contender
 team india kii nazren carabian team ke khilaaf lagaataar 10veen bilatural vanade siries jeetne par tiki hongi
 India has beaten the West Indies 2‚Äì1 in the recent T20 series and now their eyes are on clearing the team's cards in this series too while continuing their form in the ODI series
 siries shuru hone se pehle hi haalanki mejabaan team ko do bade jatke lag chuke hai
 Opener Shikhar Dhawan and fast bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar have already been ruled out of the series due to injury
 koun hoga rohit kaa saathi?dhawan ko surat main khele gaye saiyad mushtak ali trophy main maharashtra ke khilaaf ghutane main chot lag gai thi
 Mayank Agarwal has been included in the Indian team in place of Dhawan
 dhawan kii gairmaujuudagi main vanade siries main bhi pari kaa aagaaj karne kii jimmedaari rohit sharma or keel rahul ko saunpi ja sakati he
 Dhawan has not yet recovered from the injury
 mayank agarwal ko dhawan ke vikalp ke taur par team main shaamil kiya gaya he or dekhnaa yah hoga ki unhen vanade cricket main debyue kaa mauka miltaa he yaa nahin
 The Karnataka batsman was in great form in Test cricket and is associated with the team after playing a Ranji Trophy match against Tamil Nadu in Dindigul
 kuldeep yadav yaa yujavendra chahalakptain viraat kohli ke liye haalanki plaing ilevan kaa chayan karnaa thodaa mushkil hoga
 Bharat Arun, the bowling coach of the team, has already said that he is focusing on an ideal and balanced team
 ab yah dekhnaa kaaphi dilachasp hoga ki mejabaan team chennai kii dhimi pich ko dekhte hue kuldeep yadav or yujavendra chahal main se kise plaing ilevan main mauka detii he
 West Indies side is craving for victory, West Indies team has been completely flopped in odis for some time
 team ne agast 2014 ke baad se pichley 16 dwipaksheeya siries main se ek bhi siries nahin jiti he
 However, the team has made a clean sweep of Afghanistan 3‚Äì0 in their last ODI series and this has boosted the visiting team's morale
 carabian team ke liye raahat kii baat yah he ki shai hope ab team main laut chuke hai
 India won the one-day series played against the West Indies 3‚Äì1 last time at their home
 em chinnaswami stadium kii pich dhimi he or pichley saat vanade maichon main pehle ballebaaji karne vaali team ne chah baar yahaan match jite hai
 In such a situation, Kohli can win the toss and get down to bat first
 timen:bharat:viraat kohli (captain), rohit sharma, mayank agarwal, lokesh rahul, shreyas ayyar, manish pandey, rishabh pant (wicketiper), sivam dube, kedaar jadhav, rabindra jadeja, yujavendra chahal, kuldeep yadav, deepak chahar, mohammad shami, shardul thakur

 sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko bataaya ki iraq ke sankatagrast ilaakon se 17 or bharatiyon ko nikaal liya gaya he
 The Foreign Ministry has said, "with the help of Iraqi authorities, we have been able to evacuate 17 more Indians from the contiguous areas
 ve abhi baghdad main hai or jaldi hi waapas lautenge
 ' mantralay ke pravaktaa saiyad akbaruddin ne kaha ki mosul main apahrit 39 bharatiyon ko kisi kism kii yatnaa nahin di gai he or unhen koi chot yaa nuksaan nahin pahunchaaya gaya he
 He said that 46 Indian nurses are also safe in Tikrit
 sarkaar ne somvaar ko kaha tha ki 120 bhartiya iraq ke sangharsh vaale ilaake main fanse hue hai
 Sunni militants have taken a sharp lead against the Iraqi government in crisis-prone areas
 aam aadmi party main kya ho rahaa he
 Has this party also become like other parties? pichley ek hafte se yah sabase zyaada poocha jane vaala sawaal ban gaya he
 The supporters of the Aam Aadmi Party are asking the voters, the leaders and supporters of the other parties are also interested
 yah sawaal partiyon ke aantarik loktantr ke prati kaaphi ashanvit karata he
 Such questions should be articulated in between elections
 loktantr kii rasoi sirf sarkaar main nahin banati he, partiyon ke bheetar or gharon main bhi banati he
 One positive gain of this whole controversy is that people are asking what is happening in the Aam Aadmi Party
 yah to daawa nahin kar saktaa ki pehali baar ho rahaa he magar bahut jamaane ke baad sunne ko to mil hi rahaa he
 Whether Arvind Kejriwal is right or Yogendra Yadav, the question of how the party runs out of this camp has become a new thing again
 kya aap jaanate hai ki kisi party kaa sansadeey board kab rashtriya kaaryakarini se taqatvar ban jaataa he or kab rashtriya kaaryakarini majboot adhyaksh ke saamne kaagazi sanstha banakar rah jaati he
 Do you know why members are nominated in the working committee of the Congress? ve chunakar kyon nahin aate hai
 Do you know if the bjp's national executive is on its own time or not
 hoti he to isamen baton ko rakhane kii prakriya kya hoti he
 How can any ordinary worker take advantage of these processes to reach the top positions of the party without the consent of the president or the leader
 kya hamaare raajnneetik dal band darvaaze kii tarah kaam karne lage hai
 The answer to this question, we have known for decades, is that the parties have transformed into a JB organization of a big leader
 aksar ham in sawaalon ko varchasv kii ladaai ke chashme se hi dekhte hai
 Instead of accepting that there can be two types of opinions in the party, we start presenting the leader like a feud
 netaa bhi aise logon ko nikaalkar yaa haashiye par daalkar apni majbooti yaa pakad kaa pramaan dene lagate hai
 The meetings of parliamentary parties or legislative parties are no more useful than stamping
 vichaaron kii vividhta aisi baithkon main samaapt ho chuki he
 Institutions in parties have become a weapon of the battle for supremacy
 aam aadmi party ke is vivaad se do saal pehle bijepi kii bhi aisi sansthaaon kii khub charchaa hui thi jab narendra modi pradhanmantri pad ke liye apni daavedaari kar rahe the
 There were daily reports about whether he would be made a member of the parliamentary party
 kabhi ye khabar aati thi ki unhen chunaav abhiyaan samiti kaa prabhaar saunpa jayega
 Even if Modi as the chairman of the campaign committee brings a majority, the parliamentary board will decide who will be the prime minister
 party ke bheetar kii sansthaaen netritv kii ladaai ke samay daanvpench chalane ke liye jaagrit kii jaati hai, baaki samay main kaise kaam karti hai ham dhyaan hi nahin dete
 It is therefore important that apart from the battle for supremacy, we should also see it as how much space is being given to different opinions
 party kii ek raay hogi magar us ek raay banane se pehle do yaa teen raay saamne aa jaae to koun sa pahaad tut padegaa
 It is important that we give importance to the functioning of internal institutions even on normal days
 kisi bhi party ke kaaryakarta ke liye uski in sansthaaon kii paardarshita mahatvapurn honi chahie
 How many parties get beaten up at the time of ticket distribution
 afvaahen failane lagati hai ki falaan ne paise dekar tikat le liye to falaan ne paise lekar tikat baante
 Sometimes these rumors are also true
 aakhir janata ko pataa to chale ki kisi niti yaa faisle par pahunchane se pehle kin prakriyaaon ke tahat bahes hui or prastaav paarit hua
 Even after the historic victory of 67 seats, the credibility of the Aam Aadmi Party is being evaluated on the basis of its internal democracy
 aam aadmi party is paimaane par khari utari he yaa nahin is par paksh vipaksh main khub lekh likhe ja rahe hai
 Party members and supporters are asking that if there is no place of disagreement in our party then how is it different from other parties
 duusare dal ke log bhi dekh rahe the ki is nai party main kya unki party se alag asahmati kii koi jagah he
 The meeting of the Political Affairs Committee was held in honor of the disagreement or for disciplinary action, it is also being debated
 aath logon kaa yogendra yadav ke paksh main matdaan karnaa badi baat he yaa pehle se tay faisle kaa ho janaa
 Immediately after the election, when all attention is focused on how the government is run, it is asked how the party runs, moves at the behest of someone or signals someone to walk
 partiyon ke bhitari sansthaaon main dilchaspee ke ye sawaal tazaa hawa kii tarah hai
 This controversy has done the same thing
 hamaare ek mitra pankaj jha ne kaha ki dilachasp yah rahaa ki aap ke samarthakon ne netaa kii line nahin lee
 Many also supported Yogendra
 aam ke tamaam volentier is varchasv kii ladaai se khud ko alag kar party kii sansthaaon ke sawaal ke saath jud gaye
 bjp's international supporters have become famous in the name of Bhakta
 inaki chhavi aisi ban gai he ki inkaa kaam hi har faisle ko sahi tehraana he
 The international language of Aam Aadmi Party supporters has become somewhat similar
 inhen bhi aaptard kaha jaataa he yani aam aadmi party par sawaal karenge to ye abhadra bhashaa kaa istamaal karenge
 But new to this controversy is that even the supporters and well-wishers of the party gave up their devotion to the party
 ye nae tarah ke samarthak hai
 They should be especially welcome in politics
 ye andh bhakt nahin hai
 Arvind was watching the comments on Kejriwal's Facebook page
 kaiyon ne ek rahane kii apil kii thi to kaiyon ne unke kadamon kii aalochana
 Some had given the final verdict in the voice of rebellion, while many were voicing criticism at their level, despite being party supporters
 raajnneetik dal sankat se guzar rahe hai
 Many times the solution to these crises is postponed further to the stronger leader
 lekin un netaaon ko bhi aantarik sansthaaon kii taraf lautnaa hi padataa he jinhen lagata he ki party unki bapauti he
 a party is nothing without them
 congress main aantarik chunaav kii baat karne vaale rahul gandhi kaa bhi khub mazaaq uda lekin unhen bhi pataa he ki raajnneeti ko zindadil banane kaa yahi ekmaatr rasta he
 This is a difficult path because it can pose a threat to the emergence of such leadership that can challenge the traditional or established leadership
 isliye yah sawaal itnaa aasaan nahin he lekin acha he ki aap jis bhi party ke samarthak hai yaa kaaryakarta hai vahaan ye sawaal karte rahiye ki hamaari party kaise chalati he
 What is happening in our party? aam aadmi party ke dilli ke rajouri garden se vidhayak jaranel singh ne vidhansabha se istipha de diya he
 He is now active in Punjab politics and is a candidate from the Lambi Assembly there

 But in October, new cases of dengue once again sustained fever and pain
 pichley hafte darj dengue ke 578 nae maamle logon ke liye nai chintaa kaa vishay ban gaye hai
 If doctors agree, now the risk of dengue will remain for the next 3 to 4 weeks
 kyonki bich main hui thodi barish ke kaaran machharon ko phir se panpane kaa mauka mil gaya

 ' bijepi ke saath banaai nai sarkaar main dipti siem bane ajit pavaar ko waapas laane ke liye ab NCP or shivasena ke bich 50-50 formule par sahmati ban rahi he
 It is reported from the sources that both the parties have agreed to run the government for two and a half years
 isse pehle ensipi ke netaa chagan bhujabal ko ajit pavaar ko manaane ke liye unke ghar bhi gaye the
 Significantly, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had been expecting for the last two days that Ajit Pawar will return
 sanjay raut yah bhi daawa kar rahe the ki ajit pavaar ko blackmel kiya gaya he
 Let us tell you that NCP mlas have been kept in Mumbai hotel in Renson hotel but now they will be shifted to Hyatt hotel near Mumbai airport
 sutron kaa kahana he ki unhen isliye yahaan laayaa ja rahaa he kyonki yahaan par zyada koi unhen 'pareshaan' nahin kar paaegaa
 At the same time, Shiv Sena in Lalit Hotel and Congress mlas in Marriot are supported
 ensipi kaa kahana he ki uske paas 50 vidhayak hai
 The remaining four are also coming to Mumbai
 vahiin bijepi kaa daawa he ki uske paas ensipi ke sabhi 54 vidhayakon kaa samarthan he
 At the same time, all eyes are also on 13 independent mlas and 16 mlas of smaller parties, as the efforts of the big political parties in Maharashtra to do the math in their favor
 ye vidhayak 288 sadasyon vaale sadan main bahumat ke liye jaruri 145 vidhayakon ke aankade ko paane main ahm sabit honge
 The Shiv Sena, which is negotiating an alliance with Congress and NCP, claims that it has the support of seven mlas apart from its 56 mlas
 vahiin rajya main 105 vidhayakon ke saath sabase badi party bhaajapa kaa daawa he ki use 14 anya vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil he
 However, it is not clear how many mlas are with Ajit Pawar
 lekin agar 50-50 formule vaali baat par ajit pavaar laut aate hai to ek phir congress-ncp or shivasena milakar aasaani se sarkaar bana lengi
 BJP is in favor of early assembly elections in Gujarat
 chunaav samay se pehle karaane ke liye bijepi or aresas ke sheersh netaaon ke bich vichaar-vimarsh shuru ho gaya he
 Although elections in the state are scheduled by December 2017, local BJP leaders want to do it at least six months in advance
 ahmedabad mirar kii akhbaar ke anusaar bijepi ke netaaon kaa maananaa he ki jald chunaav karaane se party ko phayda ho saktaa he
 Not only this, a section of BJP is also believing that before this, radical changes will have to be made and another leader will have to be declared the chief ministerial candidate
 unka maananaa he ki vijay rupani 2017 ke mahatvapurn chunaav main lead karne laayak netaa nahin hai
 These leaders believe that if the challenge of the Aam Aadmi Party and Congress is to deal with the state, then an OBC candidate should be declared the candidate for the Chief Minister
 rajya main kareeb 45 fisadi matadaata obisi varg se aate hai
 32 of these
 5 fisadi matadaata gramin kshetron main rahete hai
 If the BJP has come out with an OBC face, then it may spoil the equation of Congress and AAP
 yah patidaaron ke liye bhi kaat sabit ho saktaa he, jo aarakshan kii maang kar rahe hai
 But the question is also, will the public accept the third chief ministerial face of the BJP within a year? Therefore, a faction is also against this idea, it believes that it has not been even six months to Rupani, so it would not be appropriate to declare someone else as the chief ministerial candidate
 rupaniki jagah kuch log varisht netaa shankar choudhary kaa bhi naam oochaal rahe hai, lekin kisi nae chehre ko bhi saamne laayaa ja saktaa he
 The circumstances are still favorable that the BJP has been performing consistently in Gujarat since 2002
 philhal rajya vidhansabha kii 182 siton main se 123 par bijepi kaa kabja he
 By the way, according to the leaders of the RSS, the BJP and the RSS are ready for early elections in the state
 agar upi or punjab ke saath chunaav ho jaaen to iske liye bhi ve taiyaar hai
 These leaders believe that there is no negative wave in public due to demonetisation, because most of the people are believing that this step of Narendra Modi is necessary to curb black money and terrorism
 philhal patel netahardikko gujarat main pravesh par court ne roak laga rakhi he
 This year, the rains and the crop have been good, which can benefit BJP now
 agle saal shaayad aisi sthiti na rahe
 Similarly, if Aam Aadmi Party performs better in Punjab and Goa, then its challenge in Gujarat may increase
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pichley do maheene main chaar baar gujarat kii yatra kii he, ise bhi jaldi chunaav karaane kaa ek sanket mana ja rahaa he

 However, now the company has mainstreamed it and given this feature in mid range smartphones
 kahana galat nahin hoga ki vivo smartfones main unic fitures dene ke maamle main duusari companiyon se ek kadam aage he
 We have used this smartphone for a long time and now we are going to give you a review of it
 dizin, disple and lukarivo kaa nayaa V15 Pro dekhne main company ke baaki smartfones jaisaa hi lagata he
 But the difference is that there will not be any notch in it because to provide full screen, a pop-up selfie camera has been given here

 Talking about the look, touching gives you this premium feel
 back main yahaan dual tone color ke saath gradient luk diya gaya he
 But this gradient look is common even in budget smartphones nowadays, so its look could be improved a bit more
 isi tarah disple kii baat karen to yahaan 91
 6 with 6% screen to body ratio
 39-inch phul-hd (1080x2340 picksal) super AMOLED disple diya gaya he or jaisaa ki hamane upar bataaya tha ki isamen koi noch nahin he
 The display is quite bright and the touch is also very smooth

 ab rahaa sawaal ki note 7 pro ek bajet smartphone he or vivo kaa ye smartphone lagbhag 29,000 rupee kaa he, tab bhi yahi procesar kyon? to iskaa jawaab ye he ki aapako is phone main dheron fitures bhi milenge jo isaki keemat ko sahi tehraate hai
 Here is the question of the speed and the lag of the phone, so you will not feel any lag while switching apps here or operating a lot of functions
 naa hi yahaan koi garam hone kii dikkat he
 One problem that was felt was that this phone hangs when the battery is low
 haalanki in sabake vabjood ise main is smartphone ke liye parfect procesar nahin kah saktaa
 You can play the rest of the game too smooth and here you will also get the option of a game cube for gaming
 isaki internal memory 128GB kii he

 saath hi aap memory card kaa bhi istemaal kar sakate hai
 Talking about software performance, this smartphone of Vivo has given Android 9 Pie based funtouch OS 9 UI

 yahaan aapako filter samet kai aise fitures milenge jo aapako baaki smartfones main bhi milte hai
 Let's talk directly on photography quality
 aapako din main brit or parfect colors ke saath photose milenge
 Here is the night mode for low-light photography that works best

 However Shastri says that the playing XI will be decided on the day of the match by looking at the weather and pitch
 viraat kohli chaahate hai ki team ke sabhi sadsy ballebaaji main bhi yogadan den, taaki vah paanch gendbaajon kii apni ranneeti ko jari rakh paaen
 Perhaps that's why Amit Mishra also practiced batting fiercely
 baad main press conference main amit ne bataaya ki kohli sabase thodi-bahut ballebaaji kii ummid kar rahe hai
 After the gaol test, captain Virat Kohli said that the stance of Shikhar Dhawan and Amit Mishra was right in the match

 Imran Khan was on a tour of India on 11 December 2015
 us din unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi se nai dilli main mulaakaat kii
 The warm-up meeting reiterated the commitment to improve relations between India and Pakistan
 tab imran khan ek purv cricketer or pakistani saansad ke taur par bharat daure par the
 Imran Khan invited Modi to come to Pakistan and then this picture of the meeting was very much discussed
 aaj alag halaat, alag manch42 maheene baad aaj halaat alag hai, donon netaaon kii sthitiyaan alag hai or ab manch par bhi alag he
 Now Imran Khan is the Prime Minister of Pakistan, after Balakot Airstrike, Narendra Modi has emerged stronger by winning the election for the second time
 13-14 june ko kirgistan ke bishkek main donon netaa aamane-saamne honge
 There will be a chance for SCO conference
 ye pehla mauka hoga jab donon netaa kisi antarrashtriya manch par ek saath pahunchenge
 How will the snow melt in the relationship? Today, the relations between the two countries are the strongest in recent times, there has been snow in the relationship and terrorism on the ground of Pakistan remains an obstacle in any effort to improve the relationship
 mumbai, uri, pathankot or pulavama jaise na jane kitne ghaav pakistan ke aatanki bharat ko de chuke hai or pakistani hukmran ection ke naam par dikhaave se zyada kuch karte najar nahin aate
 In such a situation, India has made it clear that there will be no talks with Pakistan without stopping terrorism
 modi-imran ke kirgistan ke liye ravaanaa hone se pehle pakistan kii sarkaar or khud imran khan do hafte main teen baar koshish kar chuke hai ki bharat baatcheet kii peshkash ko maan le
 But now India does not appear to trust Pakistan's double character
 imran-modi kii mulaakaat ke kisi plan se inkaar karte hue videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne saaf kaha-'jahaan tak meri jaankaree he, bishkek ke essio sammelan main pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan ke saath dwipaksheeya baithak kii koi yojana nahin he
 Negotiations since the Pathankot attack derailed Since the terror attack on Pathankot airbase in 2016, talks between the two countries have been closed
 iske baad hue uri hamale ke baad bharat ne sargical strike kar nai niti kaa ehsaas duniya ko karaayaa
 When Indian soldiers entered into pok and destroyed terrorist bases
 phir isi saal 14 farvari 2019 ko pulavama main aatanki hamalaa hua
 In response, India taught Pakistan a direct lesson by airstrike in Balakot
 donon desh yuddh kii kagaar par khadey the
 But Pakistan was able to postpone India's direct action for the time being by immediately releasing Wing Commander Abhinandan
 lekin bharat ab ye khulaa elaan kar chukaa he ki aatanki hamale honge to pakistan ke aatanki thikaanon par karrwai hogi
 It has been clearly stated from the Indian side that it will not come to the negotiating table before Pakistan can act on the terrorists present on its soil
 kitna thos he aatankiyon ke khilaaf pakistan kaa ection?pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad bhi pakistan ne ection kaa vaise hi dikhaava kiya jaise ki vah 2008 ke mumbai hamalon ke vakt kar chukaa tha
 But he could not go further than the lockdown on the madrasas of terror and the detention of some terrorists
 isliye bharat ne balakot main jaish-e-mohammad ke aatanki thikaanon ko airstrike kar tabah kiya
 Also, with the cooperation of us-france and Britain in the UN, India succeeded in declaring terrorist Masood Azhar as a global terrorist
 jabaki china pakistan se dosti nibhaane kii naakaam koshish main juta rahaa
 By prohibiting Hafiz Saeed's detention and recently his open argument on Eid, Pakistan has made an effort last week to give India a message of action against terror so that India is ready for talks but so on India's negotiating table There is little scope for return
 do hafte main teen koshishenaarthik tangi se guzar rahaa pakistan karj ke liye antarrashtriya manchon par guhaaren laga rahaa he
 Bain poses a separate threat from the FATF
 yahaan tak ki pehali baar pakistan ne apana raksha bajet ghataane kaa elaan bhi kiya he
 Apart from this, he is also urging to start repeated talks with India
 - 26 may ko pakistan piem imran khan ne piem modi ko phone kar jeet kii badhai di, or vaarta kaa aagrah kiya
 - Indications given by Pakistan for talks between the two top leaders at SCO conference- India said - PM Modi has no plans to talk to Pakistan PM during SCO conference- Pak Foreign Secretary Shah Mahmood reached India on 4 June, This led to speculation about the meeting of the two pms - on June 6, the Pakistani Foreign Minister wrote a letter to S
 Jaishankar and again requested the talks - India again said - the initiative to end the terror No talks with Pakistan mere Imran Khan on June 7, pleaded again talks write a letter to the PM
 apni chitthee main imran khan ne piem modi ko dobaaraa satta main aane par badhai di
 Imran offered to negotiate between Delhi and Islamabad to resolve the Kashmir issue, including all necessary issues
 imran khan ne aage likhaa-'donon deshon ke bich baatcheet hi ekmaatr upaay he, jisase donon deshon ke logon kii garibi dur ho sake
 Working together is very important for regional development
 pakistan sabhi samasyaon kaa hal talashna chahta he, jisamen kashmir mudda bhi shaamil he
 In 2014, PM Modi invited Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif at the swearing-in ceremony
 baad main achaanak pakistan pahunchakar piem modi ne sabko chaunkaate hue shanti kii koshishon ko ek mauka diya tha
 But nothing was found from the terrorist attacks from Pakistan
 iske baad duusari pari ke liye jab 30 may 2019 ko piem modi ne shapath lee to imran ko nahin bulaakar bimstek ke sadsy deshon ko bulaakar padosi deshon se sambandh sudhaarney or pakistan ko kadaa sandesh piem modi ne diya
 After assuming power for the second time, PM Modi first went to the neighboring country Maldives and then to Sri Lanka
 uske baad shanghai sahyog sanghathan kii meeting main
 Off the SCO meeting, he will have bilateral meetings with President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Chinese President Xi Jinping and leaders of all member countries
 lekin pakistan ke piem imran khan se kisi bhi mulaakaat kii sambhaavna ko bharat ne khaarij kar diya he
 What is SCO Summit, where all leaders including modi-imran, Jutengshanghai Cooperation Organization, SCO-SCO was formed in 2001 by the Presidents of Russia, China, Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan
 bharat ko essio main sadsyta 2017 main mili thi isi dauraan pakistan ko bhi is sanghathan main sadsyta mili thi
 For India, the SCO is a platform to increase cooperation with rapidly emerging countries in Asia and Soviet regions, but also a good diplomatic opportunity to give a strong message to terrorism by not giving Pakistan a sense in the presence of its partner China
