 It often happens that we buy eggs from the market at a dozen prices, but they cannot be finished in a day and they start spoiling
 kai baar to lambey samay tak frij main rakhe andon ke bhi kharaab ho jane kii ashanka ho sakati he
 Although eggs kept in the fridge are safe for a long time, but no one can guarantee that all the eggs brought from the market are correct
 aise main yah jaruri he ki kharaab andey kii pahchaan kerani aati ho
 It is also important to check the freshness of eggs because the consumption of bad eggs can cause many diseases and can worsen health
 iske liye kuch saamaanya se upaay he jinhen apanaakar aap sahi andey kii pahchaan kar sakate hai
 Measure No
 1
 pani main dubokarhar andey ke ek sire par andar kii ore air pocket hoti he
 This air pocket is small when the egg is fresh and it becomes large when the egg is old or spoiled
 is air pocket kii madad se hi aap andey kii freshnes jaanch sakate hai
 Fill a glass with a wide mouth
 gilaas ko itnaa khaali chhod den jisase jab anda isamen daalaa jaae to pani baahar na gire
 Now put the egg in a glass filled with water
 agar anda horigental hokar neeche baith jaataa he toiskaa matlab kii yah bilkul fresh he
 If it is lightly raised while being horizontal, it means that it is a bit old
 lekin agar anda upar aakar pani main tairne lage to jaan jaaie ki yah kharaab ho chukaa he
 As the air pocket increases, the egg becomes lighter and floats upwards
 upaay number 2
 If you wish, you can also see how fresh it is and how old it is
 agar anda fresh hoga to aap jab use phodkar kisi plate main rakhenge to aapako teen rang or do ring najar aaengi
 Look at the ring like this - a thick yellow part, followed by a slightly larger ring of cream color and finally you will see an egg white
 agar anda purana ho chukaa he to aapako gadha pilaa bhaag or kriim color vaali ring ek hi najar aaengi

 *** Both Italian marines returning to India accused of killing two Indian fishermen
 sansad main videsh mantri salmaan khurshid ne kaha he ki unhen sajaa-e-maut nahin hogi
 The deadline of the Supreme Court for the return of two accused Italian marines to India expires on Friday
 donon nausainik special vimaan se shuukravaar subah 10 baje tak bharat pahunch jaaenge
 With this, this big diplomatic victory of India
 italy kii sarkaar ne kaha he ki do bhartiya machuaaron kii hatya ke aarope kaa saamana kar rahe apane do marinon ko vah bharat waapas bhejegi
 Italy's announcement is in sharp contrast to its earlier decision by the Foreign Ministry, which stated that the two accused naval men would not be sent back to India
 gauratlab he ki messimilieno lator or sailvator jirone naam ke donon marinon ko italy ke chunaavon main matdaan ke liye swadesh jane kii anumati di gayi thi lekin is shart par ki ve mukademe kaa saamana karne ke liye 22 march tak bharat laut jaaenge
 In February last year, the two marines allegedly shot and killed two fishermen near the Kerala coast
 italy kii daleel he ki ek antarrashtriya samudri lut virdohi abhiyaan ke dauraan antarrashtriya jal kshetra main goliyaan chalin or isliye is maamle main isamen italy kaa adhikaar-kshetra hona chahie tha
 Earlier, Congress President Sonia Gandhi had expressed her anger at Italy, saying that Italy should fulfill the promise made to the Supreme Court regarding its two marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen
 sonia ne yah baat congress sansadeey dal kii baithak main party ke saansadon se kahi
 On March 14, the Supreme Court said that the Italian ambassador cannot leave the country without his permission
 court ne somvaar ko jari ek anya aadesh main prashasan se yah sunishchit karne ko kaha ki italy ke rajdoot danniel mensini desh chhodkar na ja paaen
 The Supreme Court order came after Italy refused to send nine of its soldiers to India, who are on trial in connection with the killing of two Indian fishermen here
 court ne aaropee nau sainikon ko apane desh ke aam chunaav main bhaag lene ke liye jane kii anumati di thi
 Italian ambassador to India, Mensini, then assured the court that the accused would return here after participating in the naval election
 lekin beete saptaah italy ne isse inkaar kar diya

 Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has started her election campaign from Mewar
 iske peeche kaa kaaran he ki jab-jab mewar se unhone chunavi yatra kii shuruuaat kii tab-tab rajasthan kii satta main vaapasi kii
 This journey will last about 40 days
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah is yatra kii shuruyaat ke dauraan maujuud rahe to piem modi iske samaapan ke maukey par maujuud rahenge
 The invincible land of South Rajasthan, Mewar has a different significance in Rajasthan politics
 kaha jaataa he ki rajasthan main satta kaa rasta mewar se hi hokar gujarata he
 The one who wins Mewar rules Rajasthan
 yah aadhunik loktantric avadharana hi nahin, madhyakaalin raajapootaana (aaj kii taarikh main rajasthan) kaa shakti kaa centre bhi mewar hi tha
 Find out the facts of history and talk about Maharana Pratap, the mighty ruler of Mewar, the Mughal emperor Akbar could not conquer Mewar till the end even after making all efforts
 maharana pratap ne haar nahin maani or akbar maharana ke pratap ko parrast nahin kar paae
 So Akbar concentrated his attention on Delhi
 samrik drushtikon se mahatvapurn rajasthan ke aitihaasik durg-chitaudgarh, kumbhalgarh mewar main hi sthit hai
 History of Mewar: The Mewar kingdom of Rajasthan has been a land of mighty gahlots, who have their own history
 apni mathrubhumi, dharm, samskruti kii raksha ke liye gahaloton ke parakram ne mewar par amit chhap chodi he
 Mewar was ruled by Rajputs for a long time
 baad main muslim aakrantaon nen yahaan kii dharoharon ko kaaphi kshati pahunchaai
 Alauddin Khilji, the ruler of the Khilji dynasty, defeated Gehlot ruler Rawal Ratan Singh in the year 1303 and made it a part of the Delhi Sultanate
 vahiin, gahalot vansh kii ek shakha sisodiya vansh ke hammirdev ne mohammad tughlaq ke samay main chittod ko jitkar puure mewar ko swatantra kara liya
 In the year 1431, Rana Kumbha ascended the throne of Mewar
 rana kumbha or rana sanga ke samay mewar kii takat apane utkarsh par thi, lekin lagaataar hote rahe bahari akramanon ke kaaran rajya vistaar main kshetra kii seemaa badalati rahi
 Rana Kumbha built the strong impregnable fort Kumbhalgarh in Rajsamand from a strategic point of view
 lekin jis rana kumbha ko koi parajeet nahin kar paaya, unki unke hi putr udaisingh ne saal 1473 main hatya kar di
 Uday Singh could not rule for long due to opposition from Rajputs
 udai singh ke baad unke chote bhai rajmal ne 36 varsh tak safal shashan kiya
 After the death of Rajmal in the year 1509, his son Rana Sangram Singh or Rana Sanga sat on the throne of Mewar
 rana sanga ne apane shasankaal main dilli, malwa, gujarat ke viruddh yuddh kiye, lekin saal 1527 main khanvaa ke yuddh main mughal badshaah babar ne unako parajeet kar diya
 In the year 1624, the warlike Mughal emperor Akbar of Haldi valley invaded Mewar and surrounded Chittor
 par rana udai singh ne akbar kii adheenta sweekaar nahin kii or pracheen adhatpur ke paas udaipur ko apni rajdhani banaakar vahaan chale gaye
 After him Maharana Pratap also continued the war and did not accept Akbar's subjection
 akbar or maharana pratap kaa yuddh haldi ghati ke yuddh ke naam se itihaas main prasiddh he
 Akbar also drove Maharana Pratap from Kumbhalmer fort and made several attacks on Mewar, but Maharana did not accept subjugation
 antat: saal 1642 ke baad akbar ne apana dhyaan duusare rajyon main kendrit kar liya or maharana pratap ne apane sthanon par phir se adhikaar kar liya
 He died in 1654 at Chawand
 maharana pratap ke baad unke putr rana amarsingh ne bhi mughalon kaa pratirodh kiya, par ant main unhonen mughal shaasha jahangir se sandhi kar lee or apane rajkumaar rana karn singh ko mughal darbar main bhej diya, lekin swayan maharana ne anya raajaaon kii tarah darbar main janaa sweekaar nahin kiya
 Udaipur remained the permanent capital of Mewar since Rana Karnasingh, until Rajputana was merged into India on 18 April 1948 by Rana Bhupal Singh
 mewar kaa raajnneetik itihaashadivasee bahul mewar main paanch loksabhaa siten or aath jile hai
 Assembly has 28 seats in Mewar, out of which 19 seats are reserved for Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes
 prashasnic taur par is kshetra ko udaipur sambhag ke naam se janaa jaataa he, jisamen-udaipur, chittorgarh, rajsamand, pratapgarh, bansawada, dungarpur, bhilwara, sirohi jile kaa kuch hissaa shaamil he
 After independence, the monarchy was demolished in the country and Rajputana was transformed into Rajasthan, but the politics of modern Rajasthan considered Mewar as its karmabhoomi and did not let its importance diminish, because they knew that without Mewar, Jaipur would Can not be ruled
 rajasthande raajnneetik itihaas main mewar kaa dabadabaa to rahaa hi he, yahaan ke netaaon kaa bhi rajasthan kii raajnneeti main hameshaa se varchasv rahaa he
 Congress stalwarts CP Joshi and Girija Vyas come from Mewar
 mohanlal sukhadiya se lekar haridev joshi, shivacharan maathur le lekar heeralaal devpura or gulabchand kataaria kaa rajasthan kii raajnneeti main acha khaasaa asar rahaa he
 History is a witness to how much Mewar contributed in bringing Haridev Joshi, Mohan Lal Sukhadia and Ashok Gehlot to the post of Chief Minister
 saal 1952 se ho rahe chunaavon ke parinaam dekhen, to palada congress kaa hi baari rahaa
 Mohanlal Sukhadia, the reigning chief minister of the state, had Mewar
 vahiin haridev joshi ne mukhyamantri banakar vaagad ko siyaasi pahchaan di
 In the last few years, there was such a political boil that Kamal left the claws here
 adivasee anchal main vanavaasiyon ke bich khud ko sthapit karne ke liye rashtriya swayan sevak sangh ne kadam badaye
 Later the Jana Sangh and BJP formed the organization
 aakhir kya vajah he ki 200 siton vaali vidhansabha main 28 siton vaala mewar itnaa mahatv rakhata he? rajasthan ke rajaneta bhaleebhanti jaanate hai ki rana pratap kii dharti detii he, to chappar faad kar detii he, lekin jab waapas leti he, tab sab kuch le leti he
 In the 2013 assembly elections, the Congress was swept out of Mewar and in 28, 26 seats came to bjp's account
 isi tarah 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main congress ko mewar kii 28 main se 22 siten milin or 96 siton par jeet ke saath ashok gahalot siem bane
 In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the five parliamentary seats were in the account of the Congress, while the opposite results were seen just before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 isse saaf hota he ki mewar ne kabhi kisi ko milajula bahumat nahin diya, jab diya spasht diya
 That is why the political message emanating from Mewar is reflected throughout Rajasthan
 ek baar phir rajasthan main siyaasi ranbheri baj chuki he or mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne abhiyaan kii shuruyaat mewar ke charbhuja nath mandir se aashirwad lekar kii he
 But according to local experts and analysts, this time Vasundhara Raje's path is not easy

 aaie jaanate hai ki aisi koun si samasyaayein yaa mudde hai jinhen nunatam saajha kaarykram main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 
 
 1
 aniyantrit pravasimaharashtra main pravaasiyon kaa mudda behad jaruri he
 The arrival and departure rate of migrants in this state is one of the highest in the country
 sabase bada kaaran he - rojgaar, acchhee padhai, phydemand vyavsaay or aasaan jivan
 The geographical location of the state is such that it is easy to reach from any corner of the country
 bahut se garib parivaar yahaan behatar jivan ke liye aate hai
 Live in bridges, subways, slums etc
 mana jaataa he ki mumbai or thane main bangladeshi or nepali bahutayat main hai
 The population is increasing due to migrants in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Nashik
 2
 The scarcity of natural resources is a problem of water shortage in Maharashtra
 pichley ek dashak se yah samasya or teji se bad rahi he
 To feed the ever-increasing population of the state, natural resources are being exploited so much that Vidarbha and Marathwada are declared drought-prone every year
 khandesh, marathavada or vidarbha ke kisaanon kii haalat bahut kharaab he
 3
 teji se ho rahi wanon kii kataiwestern ghat vishwa dharohar hai
 But due to urbanization, uncontrolled felling of trees is taking place in the forests of this entire range
 nateeja western ghat se jeev-jantuon kaa khaatmaa ho rahaa he
 In Konkan too, forests are being harvested in the name of development
 paryaton teji se bad rahaa he lekin iske saath-saath pradooshan bhi teji se ho rahaa he
 The recent boast over the Aarey forest in Mumbai is a recent example
 4
 Rapidly increasing pollution When the population increases rapidly in the state, due to this, pollution also increases rapidly
 kachra prabandhan, pradooshan ko lekar rajya sarkaar aisa koi kaam nahin kar rahi he jo khuli ankhon se dikhaai de
 Every year, Mumbai gets flooded due to mismanagement of waste
 samudri taton par bhi kachare kaa ambara laga rahata he
 5
 chote shaharon kaa vikaas karnamaharashtra main mumbai, thane or pune ko chhod de to baaki shaharon ko puri tarah se viksit kahana puri tarah se sahi nahin hoga
 It is also necessary to develop Tier-2 cities such as Nagpur, Nashik, Sangli, Kolhapur, Amravati, Solapur

 The streets are spread like wounded corpses
 bachche, auraten sabhi duniya se madad kii apil kar rahe hai
 The world is silent
 beete ek maheene main 400 se adhik naagarik maare gaye hai
 Read the writing of Jenin Giovanni, a journalist in the Guardian newspaper
 25 saal se duniya ke alag-alag ilaakon main unhone yuddh cover kiye hai
 They have witnessed all kinds of vandalism but the barbarity of Aleppo has shaken them
 unhone likhaa he ki ek yuddh samvaadadaata ke rup main unhen lagata he ki vah fail ho gaye hai
 He is not interested in any political aspect
 unki samvednaa un logon ke prati he jo rajya ke aatank kaa shikaar hue or is grih yuddh main funs gaye hai
 i have never seen a worse war in 25 years
 isamen vipaksh bhi apradhi he, satta paksh bhi apradhi he
 People are going to hide in the cellars but even the basement is not able to save
 jenin ne likhaa he ki unhone bosnia yuddh ke dauraan sarayevo ko cover kiya tha
 They remember how dreadful it is to hide in the basement waiting for Russian tanks
 unhone kaha, main un nagarikon ke bare main soch rahaa hum jinke bich rahakar maine kitaab likhi he
 Wrote the report for the United Nations
 main soch rahaa hum ki kya wo bachenge bhi
 i tweeted a lot today, but i got a lesson from the silence of the people
 mujhe pataa chalaa he ki logon kii jaagrukta mar chuki he
 How the society of the world has failed
 hamaare netaa is yuddh ko na to khatm kar rahe hai or na hi is barbar narsanhaar ke bare main duniya ko bataa rahe hai
 The war that is taking place in Syria is not a war against terrorism
 isis yaa al nusra ke kilaaf yuddh nahin he
 There is no war against Al Qaeda
 rus or uski sahyogi senaayen duniya ko yahi yakeen dilaanaa chaahati hai lekin 2011 main ek shantipurna baghawat ko kis tarah se grih yuddh main badal diya gaya or phir ise narsanhaar main badla gaya, aleppo kii yahi kahani he
 Nobody talks about this story
 purvi aleppo main nagarikon ke maare jane kii khabaren aate hi media main ek doosraa hi yuddh chhid gaya
 One accused that he would now support the rebel and terrorist groups on the pretext of killing these civilians, while one accused that he would exaggerate the interests of the US and Saudi groups
 rus kaa media kuch or kahata he america kaa media kuch or
 There are many different people who are writing, but perhaps people have changed
 tahkhaane main chhipe bacchon ko maaraa ja rahaa he agar isse duniya nahin hilti he to phir us duniya se koi kya ummid kare
 Numerous articles are being published that the world has failed in the case of Aleppo

 Someone has written and it is being shared widely that since 1839 Syria has been opening its doors to refugees
 1914 main arminiya ke sharnaarthiyon ko jagah di
 In 1967 Palestine refugees were accommodated
 1990 main kuwait ke sharnaarthi aae to 2003 main iraq ke sharnaarthi
 Syria opened the doors for refugees from Lebanon in 2006
 yah itihaas kii kitaab main likhaa jayega ki syria ne kabhi apane darvaaze unke liye band nahin kiye jo panaah maang rahe the unhen tambuon main nahin rakhaa balki apane gharon ke darvaaze unke liye khole
 The roads were cleared
 shaharon ke naam badal diye gaye
 It will also be written in the history book so that generations can remember it
 yahi ki jab syria ko madad kii zarurat thi, uske log panaah maang rahe the to duniya ne apni simaaon ko band kar diya tha
 Aleppo has no one truth
 virodhiyon kii barbarta kam nahin he
 The genocide of the government is no less
 vahaan lard rahi aatankwaadi takatein bam plant kar bhaagane vaali takatein nahin hai
 It is fighting the superpowers with military capability
 do-chaar yaa das din se nahin balki teen chaar paanch saal se
 If they are just terrorists then where are the resources coming from them
 america or rus donon mahashaktiyon ke kheme aatank se ladane ke naam par ek-duusare se lard rahe hai
 Aleppo is necessary for Assad's victory, but even after five years of practice, the Islamic State still exists
 sawaal he ki kya yah jang he yaa jang ke naam par koi khel chal rahaa he
 This game of imperialist forces is being played in the name of fighting terrorism
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad bhi ek chiz he
 What is its role khabaron main likhaa he ki jab bhi yuddh or narsanhaar ke khilaaf koi prastaav aata he rus vito kar detaa he
 The rest of the world remains silent
 sanyukt raashtra kahata he ki 80 se adhik naagarik maare gaye
 The government of Syria and Russia say that this news is incorrect
 koi kahata he ki 50,000 log fanse hue hai
 Some say one lakh people are stranded
 sarkaar kahati he ki 15 hazaar aam log nikaale jaaenge
 The rebels say that only the wounded will be sent out
 nagarikon ko aatankwaadi gut bhi maar rahe hai or aatankwaadiyon se ladane aa rahi mahashaktiyaan bhi maar rahi hai
 The decline of journalism is also an aspect in the coverage of this war
 har taraf se propeganda he
 Everyone has their own truth, but nobody has anything to do with the innocent children being killed
 is tufaan main bhi un bahadur doctoron kii sochiye jo jaan par khel vahaan maujuud hai logon kii jaan bachaane

 Aleppo remained quiet for nearly a year when protests against the Syrian President Bashar al-assad's government began throughout the country during the Arab Spring
 balki asad ke samarthan main yahaan pradarshan hue
 The rebels later arrived here and made Aleppo their hideout
 rus kii sarkari agency tas ne kaha he ki vidrohiyon ke kabze vaale ilaake se logon ko nikaala ja rahaa he

 isliye aaj kaa puraa din bank se paise nikaalane main lagane kaa faisla kiya he
 Some people standing in queues also praised the bank employees, in this crowd they are helping people
 congress bainkon ke baahar qatari main khadey logon kii madad ke liye unhen chaay or pani muhaiyaa kara rahi he
 The situation is similar in other parts of the country

 Chaos has also been reported from many places
 is halaat se nipatane membank karmchaarike bhi paseene chhot rahe hai
 Many branches were open till 10 o'clock in the past days, so that problems of people are reduced
 vahiin logon kaa kahana he ki bank se jo 2000 rupee ke nae note mil rahe hai use kharch karne main pareshaani ho rahi he, itane bade note ko khule karne ke liye koi raji nahin he, kyonki isse chote note 500 or 1000 ke band hai or 100 rupee ke note bazaar main praryaapt maatra main nahin he jo logon kii samasyae hal ho sake
 People fighting bank employees In Muzaffarnagar Suzru village of Uttar Pradesh, more than 100 people were booked for stone pelting and quarreling with bank employees while replacing old notes with new ones

 vahiin bihar ke patna main bank ke baahar line main lagi mahilaon ke bich jhadap kii khabaren ai hai
 The patience of people standing in line is being broken now

 In this meeting of opposition leaders, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal were present
 isaki jaankaree dete hue sharad pavaar ne bataaya ki vipaksh ne is baithak main teen muddon par charchaa kii
 In which there was talk on agrarian crisis, unemployment and attacks on institutions
 unhone kaha ki pashchim bengal main jo hua, vipaksh is mudde par mangalvaar ko charchaa karegaa or aage kii ranneeti tay hogi
 Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu said that what happened in West Bengal has been condemned by all of us
 ab mangalvaar ko ham ek baar phir baithenge or is mudde par samuhik nirnay lenge
 Asked why the Congress did not attend this meeting, Naidu said that he himself had asked Sharad Pawar about this
 unhone bataaya ki yah shishtachar bhent thi or is baithak ke bare main kisi ko bataaya nahin gaya tha
 The Congress leadership will attend the meeting on Tuesday
 gauratlab he ki sibiai ke ection ke khilaaf pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ke riection ne tamaam vipakshi dalon ko ekajute kar diya he
 After the incident on Sunday late, all the leaders - Rahul Gandhi, Chandrababu Naidu, Sharad Pawar, Tejashwi Yadav, Arvind Kejriwal, Akhilesh Yadav, even the neutral BJD supremo and Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik also condemned it by forgetting their differences
 was
 bataa den inamen se adhiktar wo dal hai jo pehle congress ke virdohi rah chuke hai
 Mamta Banerjee and Sharad Pawar themselves separated the Congress and made their political existence
 lekin aaj ye sabhi dal ekajute hokar aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main centre kii modi sarkaar ke khilaaf hukanr bhar rahe hai
 Recall that the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, had gathered regional parties behind him during the last Lok Sabha election, saying that the Delhi Sultanate has always disregarded him
 ab mamata banerjee piem modi kii isi ranneeti kaa istemaal unheen par kar rahi hai or centre main sattadhari bijepi virdohi rajya sarkaron ko pratadit karne kaa aarope lagaate hue vipaksh ko ekajute kar rahi hai
 However, this action of the CBI has united the opposition on one side

 Chandrasekhar Rao is seen to be isolated in this case
 pre-monsoon desh kii rajdhani main dastak de chukaa he lekin agar rajdhani main monsoon kii taiyaariyon par najar daalen to ek baar phir logon kii samasyaayein jas kii tas bani hui hai
 As soon as it rains, it is difficult for people to have garbage around the houses and open drains
 abhi monsoon puri tarah aayaa bhi nahi hai or logon kii gandagi, badboo or bimariyon kii pareshaaniyaan shuru ho chuki hai
 Chirag The smell of stench in the open drain of Delhi is that it is difficult to pass around it
 naale ke aasapaas 11 se 12 hajaar kii rihaayshi aabaadi hai jo har barsaat main is naale kii badboo or panapatemchharon se hone vaali bimariyon kaa danshjhelte hai
 Governments kept changing, but no one could do anything about this open drain
 jor kii barsaat main is naale kaa pani or kooda sadakon tak aa jaataa he
 The Aaj Tak team also called Pooja Jangra, the new corporator of the area, near this drain and asked about this serious problem, they asked to raise the issue of this drain in the corporation
 lekin isgambhir samasyako lekar parshad mahodaya ke paas koi pukhta jawaab or planning najar nahin ai
 It is clear from these pictures of some areas of the capital that even this time before the rain, no firm preparations for cleaning garbage or drains are seen by the corporation and the government
 ab aise main rajdhanivasiyon ko dhoop or garmi se to kuch raahat mil gai lekin barsaat kii pareshaaniyaan unke saamne jas kii tas hi khadi hui hai
 There has been a new debate on the issue of conversion in the country
 maujuuda daur main dharm ke naam par raajnneeti kii nai ibarat likhi ja rahi he, vahiin anti canvarjan lau yani dharmantaran virdohi kanoon kii maang bhi hone lagi he
 Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj also lays down the agreement saying that unless a law is made on this issue, it cannot be effectively stopped
 haalanki vah is baat ko bhi sweekaar karti hai ki iske liye sabhi dalon ko aage aane kii jarurat he
 On the occasion of the completion of seven months of the Modi government and Good Governance Day organized on the birthday of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Sushma Swaraj said, 'we have also said in the Lok Sabha that all parties should come forward to make a strong law in this matter
 Will happen
 jab tak saare dal is mudde par ek hokar samarthan nahin denge, tab tak is par prabhavi roak nahin lag sakegi
 The Foreign Minister said that in the last seven months, the Narendra Modi government has met both the criteria by giving a development oriented and good governance
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri jan dhan yojana or mek in india kaa naaraa isi disha main kiye gaye prayaas hai
 He said, 'for the first time under the Jan Dhan Yojana, 97 percent of the country's population has been linked with banks by opening seven and a half crore new accounts in the country and the target is to connect 100 percent people to the bank by 26 January
 ' unhone kaha ki jab shat pratishat janata bank se jud jaayegi to sarkaar kii yojanaon ko laabh sidhe janata tak pahunch sakegaa
 Employment will be provided by Make in India, Sushma Swaraj said that similarly, the Prime Minister has given a call to make entrepreneurs in India and abroad to give a slogan of Make in India
 yadi desh main kaarkaane lagenge to hamaare yahaan ke yuvaaon ko rojgaar mil sakegaa
 Referring to complaints of corruption and irregularities in passport offices, Sushma Swaraj said that in the past there were many complaints about making passports, but we have tried to address these complaints in a time bound manner
 unhone bataaya ki passport banane main lagane vaali deree ke bare main pataa kiya gaya to maaloom hua ki desh main passport banane vaali paanch lakh bucolats kii kami thi or hamane is maamle main aane vaali sari dikkaton ko dur karte hue ek maah main hi chah lakh bucolats chhapavakar de di
 Similarly, earlier it used to take 28 working days to make passports, which has been reduced to seven working days and now it is also targeted to reduce it to three days
 jald shuru hoga i-passportvidesh mantri ne bataaya ki mantralay jald hi i-passport kii seva shuru karne par vichaar kar rahaa he
 While acknowledging the lack of passport offices in the country, Sushma said that there were only two passport offices in the North Eastern states and now we have opened offices in all the North East states
 seemaa par diya karaara javabavidesh mantri ne kaha ki chaahe desh kii seemaa par golibari ho yaa desh main naksaliyon dwaara kii gai vaardaat
 We have given a befitting reply to all
 iraq main 39 bharatiyon ke laapata hone sambandhi sawaal ke jawaab main sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki laapata bharatiyon ko dhughane ke prayaas main kisi prakaar kii koi kami nahin rakhi ja rahi he, lekin ham saadhe saat hajaar logon ko vahaan se surakshit nikaalkar laae hai
 Apart from this, three and a half thousand Indians have been brought from Libya and one thousand Indians have also been brought from Ukraine
 videshi bainkon main kaledhan ke sawaal prashn sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki kalaadhan laane ke liye sarkaar ne kam kaam nahin kiya he or pradhanmantri ne ji-20 sammelan main bhi ise prabhavi dhang se uthaaya tha
 -input language kya samvedanheen ho gai he uttar pradesh sarkaar? kya moujvaad main badal gaya he mulaayam singh yadav kaa samaajwaad? ye sawaal is liye uth rahe hai kyonki pradesh main jahaan ek ore log mujffarnagar ke danga peedit raahat shiviron main thand main marane ke liye majaboor hai vahiin saifai main lok kala samskruti ko badhaava dene ke naam par bollywood ke thumake par pani kii tarah paisa bahaya gaya
 It is said that the ruler of Rome was playing Nero Banshee when he was burning
 aisa hi kuch najaara uttar pradesh main bhi dekhne ko mila
 The Saifai festival is being celebrated on one side and the riot victims of Muzaffarnagar on the other side are not getting any relief even in the relief camp
 mujffarnagar se saifai tak main badal gai pradesh kii tasviir
 
 
 How the world changes in a single state, it tells the distance between Muzaffarnagar to Saifai
 paanch ghante kaa ye safar tay kar len, to dojakh se jananath kaa safar puraa ho jaae
 If you look at the pictures of the Saifai Festival with the mishandling of the relief camp of the riot victims in Muzaffnagar, then the same question will arise in the mind that what has happened to the UP government? 
 
 bollywood ke tamaam chote-bade sitare mulaayam or akhilesh ke angane main unki dhun par naachne pahunche the
 While away from Saifai, Muzaffarnagar was shedding tears over his powerlessness
 aaj mujffarnagar bhi sochataa hoga ki kaash meri kismat saifai jaisi hoti
 On the one hand, wish that this night comes to an end, on the other hand, amidst the bad weather, the prayers of the riot victims battling the bitter cold in the relief camps, wish that the night should be cut soon
 mujffarnagar ke camp main log maren to maren fark nahin padataa
 The celebration should not fade away in Saifai
 saifai main beeti raat ke chakachaundh ko dekhakar yahi samaj main aata he
 You get the feeling @imvkohli is going to be the difference between the 2 teams over the new few weeks

 In an important case related to having sex with a minor wife, the Central Government, while presenting an answer before the Supreme Court, has said that it is not a crime to have sex with a minor wife of 15 to 18 years
 darasal IPC375 (2) kanoon kaa yah apwaad kahata he ki agar koi 15 se 18 saal kii patni se sambandh banaata he to use dushkarm nahin mana jayega
 The Central Government, advocating the law in the court, said that Parliament did not tease this law in view of social conditions
 desh main aarthik rup se pichde samaaj main aaj bhi bal vivaah ke maamle dekhne ko milte hai
 Bacteria present in children's throats can cause joint infection
 During the hearing on the plea that raping a wife of 15 to 18 years, the Supreme Court had said that the practice of sati was also going on for centuries, but she too Abolished, not necessarily the practice that has been in place for centuries
 supreme court ne ye baat tab kahi jab centre sarkaar kii taraf se ye daleel di gai ki ye parampara sadiyon se chali aa rahi he
 Therefore, Parliament is protecting it
 yani agar koi 15 se 18 saal kii bivi se sambandh banaata he to use dushkarm nahin mana jayega
 The central government also said that if the court feels that it is not right, then the Parliament will consider it
 isse pehle bal vivaah ke maamle main sunwaayee karte hue supreme court ne mangalvaar ko kaha tha ki kanoon main bal vivaah ko aparaadh mana gaya he
 Despite that, people do child marriages
 court ne tippanee karte hue kaha ki ye shaadi nahin, balki miraj yani mrigatrushna he
 The Supreme Court said that we have three options - first remove this exception, which means that in the case of child marriage with a girl of 15 to 18 years if her husband forms a relationship and is considered a rape
 jaaniye, maa ke doodh main aisa kya hota he, jo bacchon ko sankraman se bachaata he
 
 
 The court said that the second option is to implement the POSCO Act in this case
 yani bal vivaah ke maamle main 15 se 18 saal kii ladki ke saath agar uskaa pati sambandh banaata he to usapar posco ke tahat karwaai ho
 And the third option is that nothing should be done in this and it should be considered an exception, which means that in the case of child marriage, if her husband forms a relationship with a girl of 15 to 18 years, she will not be considered a rape
 vahiin yachikakarta kii taraf se mangalvaar ko daleel di gai thi ki bal vivaah se bacchon ke adhikaron kaa ulanghan ho rahaa he
 Child marriage is a kind of crime against children, because they get more sexual harassment by getting married at a young age
 aise main bacchon ko protect karne kii jarurat he
 On this, the Center has said in its affidavit that despite the declaration of child marriage as illegal since 2006, child marriage is still prevalent in many parts of the country
 aise main vivaahit purush or mahilaon kii suraksha ko sunishchit kiya janaa anivaary he
 Explain that the marriage age in the country has been kept at 18 for women and 21 for men
 isse kam umr main hui shaadi ko jurm mana gaya he
 The Indian Penal Code may carry a sentence of two years in the case

 After a major reshuffle in the cabinet, the Manmohan government seems to have started improving its image

 But due to the opposition of Anna and Aruna Rai then the government gave up its intention to pass these amendments at that time
 iske baad sarkaar ek upyukt avasar talash rahi thi
 Sonia was also unhappy with the amendment, but the government had to kneel in the face of constant opposition from RTI activists and left her intention to amend the act

 Whenever elections start coming closer, political visits to Dalits increase
 kuch log or partiyaan bhojan kii raajnneeti karne lag jaati hai
 Trying to make Dalits their home by eating food is not new
 yah kaam haalia netaaon main rahul gandhi ne shuru kiya tha
 It is another matter that it had no significant impact
 rahul gandhi jab-tab daliton ke ghar rukkar unke yahaan bhojan karte hai
 BJP President Amit Shah has also been doing this
 shah ne to banaras main ek dalit ke ghar bhojan kiya tha par unka vah daanv ulta pad gaya tha
 Amit Shah dined at the house of the Dalit and after that there were so many incidents of Dalit oppression across the country that the government came to the rescue
 use rakshaatmak mudra main aana padaa
 Although the Bharatiya Janata Party had directed its leaders to dine in Dalits' homes to connect the Dalits with their party, there was no directive of the party to speak in a fluent manner
 so jab-jab daliton ke ghar bhojan kar aae netaaon kii jabaan fisali, party kii bhad pitati najar ai
 Anupama Jaiswal, a minister in the Yogi government, said, "the government ministers go to the homes of Dalits overnight and bite mosquitoes
" machhar kaatane ke baavjood daliton ke ghar rukate hai
 Earlier, Rajendra Pratap, a minister in the Yogi government, compared himself to Lord Ram
 rajendra pratap ne kaha, ''ram ne bhi shabari ke juthe ber khaae the
 Sugarcane Development Minister Suresh Rana of UP government had enjoyed hand made spinach paneer, makhni dal, chickpeas, raita, tandoor, coffee, rasgulla and mineral water at the Dalit family
 lekin kya raajnneetik dalon ke is kadam kii vaaki koi ahmiyat he yaa phir yah daliton kaa uddhaar karne jaisaa ahanmanyta bharaa koi kadam hi he?kya daliton ke ghar bhojan karnaa votbank pakkaa karne kii guarantee he? yah sawaal isliye kyonki badalte saamaajik daur main bhi daliton ko istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 Whether they get the benefits of development schemes or not, the Dalit vote bank definitely becomes
 aise kadam daliton ko ek cader votbank main badalane ke liye hi uthaae jate hai
 Dalit voters in Uttar Pradesh around 20
 5 fisadi hai
 In fact, Dalits have been lacking in options in terms of leadership, perhaps because they are a bit easier to use and the food of the Dalit becomes a 'drama hit'
 baharhaal, bharat main saath khaane kii samasya kahin zyada gambhir he
 This debate, along with being connected to non-vegetarian, depends on whether vegetarianism and non-vegetarian is also done
 agar bhartiya gaanvon main jaaen, to aapako kaccha or pakkaa khaane kii paribhaasha samajhnaa hoga or yah bhi jaananaa hoga ki kaccha khaanaa kab khaaya ja saktaa he or pakkaa khaanaa kab?yah sirf jati se judaa masalaa nahin he
 Even in the same caste, raw food is not eaten together even before the relationship is decided
 saath hi khaanaa ho, to uma bharti kii salaah ko apnaanaa ahm hoga ki daliton ko apane ghar (sirf netaa hi kyon?) bulaakar saath baithkar khaanaa chahie
 However, the question is that in the post-ambedkar, post-mandal political era, how important is it for Dalits to cook here and eat together in their dishes? Whereas other issues related to Dalits are more important
 khaskar pichley do saal main jab dalit utpeedan, saamaajik judaav, rojgaar, shiksha, swasthya, garima or uchit pratinidhitiv kaa sawaal adhik mahatvapurn he, saath khaane jaise pratikatmak baton ko gaun hi rakhana chahie

 However, despite the presence of the police, the fight rose to halt and escalated

 In a short period of time, the police overpowered both the sides and were taken to the nearby police post

 They also take worship from temple shops

 It is not hidden from anyone that this temple of Sai has also got the eye of the terrorists

 But the police stationed outside security is nowhere to be seen

 a contingent of 76 CRPF personnel set up to open the road was besieged and badly crushed by over 300 guerrillas of two 'companies' of Maoists in Burkapal in Sukma district of Chhattisgarh on 24 April
 nishane sadhakar kii gai andhadhundh golibari main siarpief ke 25 jawan maare gaye
 This was his most gruesome and deadly attack since April 2010
 us vakt unhone dantewada jile ke chintalnar main isi tarah ghaat lagaakar kiye gaye hamale main siarpief ke 75 javaanon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 After that, on March 11 also, the Maoists had gunned down 12 CRPF jawans with bullets at Bendji, 20 km from the district headquarters Sukma
 chhipakar kiye gaye ye donon hamale us sukama main kiye gaye jo maovadiyon kaa garh he
 The militants call it their annual Tactical Counter Offensive Campaign (TCOC)

 Especially when the government was celebrating the amazing shortage of Maoism-related violence last year
 is saal 17 march ko kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh ne loksabhaa ko bataaya tha ki vampanthi ugravad (eldblyoo) se prabhavit jilon kii taadaad 106 se ghatakar 68 rah gai thi
 Of them, 35 were the most affected, in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Maharashtra
 pichley chaar maheenon main desh ke chah rajyon main 158 log—maovadi, aam log or surakshakarmi—maare gaye hai
 No matter how terrible these deaths are, they are unlikely to change much in the section which is gradually turning against the left wing extremism
 april, 2006 main jise tab ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne chetavanee dete hue òòdesh ke saamne maujuud aantarik suraksha ke liye ab tak kaa ek hi sabase bada khatraóó bataaya tha, vah bheeshan khatra apane ko bachaane ke liye haath-pair maar rahaa he
 The Maoists certainly have the ability to surprise, but they are gradually losing ground and foot soldiers in this fight to destroy the country's state power
 chhattisgarh main hi, jahaan unki sabase zyada maujuudagi he, zyaadaatar dakshini jilon main, maovadiyon ke kabje vaale ilaake sikudakar mahaj 5,000 varg kimi se kuch zyada rah gaye hai, jabaki ek dashak pehle 20,000 varg kimi ilaakon par unka kabja tha
 In 2010, 1,180 people were killed in Naxalite violence — not only were they more than double the number of Indian soldiers killed in the 1999 Kargil war, but so much so that it could be called a high-intensity battle
 tab se naksalwad se judi hinsa main marane waalon kii taadaad pichley saal ab tak kii sabase kam mahaj 161 tak neeche aa gai thi
 This is the fastest such decline in 15 years of left-wing extremism (see graphic: Rebellion surrounded on all sides)
 magar us padaav se ham ab bhi varshon dur hai jise suraksha visheshgy mishan puraa hone kaa elaan karne kii purvashart kehete hai yani—vampanthi ugravad se judi kisi bhi ghatana se mukt ek puraa saal
 The inaccessible mountainous forests of Abujhmad, which are spread over an area of nearly 4,000 km in the southern districts of Chhattisgarh, Bijapur, Narayanpur and Dantewada, are the main strongholds of Maoism
 vampanthi ugravadiyon kii sabase badi taadaad yaheen ikattha he or inhen ghaney jangalon main ve apni samanaantar sarkaar chalaate hai jise ve ‘ janatanaa sarkaar’ kehete hai
 But the most important place is Sukma, whose outskirts meet directly with Andhra Pradesh and Odisha and is called by a big government official 'the real capital of Maoist rule'

 It serves as a safe haven for them, which is also the reason that almost all the growing Maoist leaders belong to Telugu speaking states

 maovadiyon kaa angan sukama hi he jahaan ve sabase vahashi jang lard rahe hai, us cheez ke khilaaf jise vah apana sabase bada khatra maanate hai or vah haih sadak
 The attack on 11 March was on the soldiers who were guarding the benji-injiram road and the 24 April attack was carried out on the troops who were involved in the construction of the 56 km dornapal-jagargunda road
 chhattisgarh ke dakshini jilon main rajya sarkaar 400 kimi lambii sadakon kaa jaal bicha rahi he, is par pichley kai saalon main maovadiyon ne sadakon ko khod daalaa he, barudi surangen bichaai hai or pul-puliyon ko dhamaakon se udaaya he
 "roads bring development and also increase the speed of deployment of security forces," says a senior Union Home Ministry official
 inase unhen jagah or vakt kaa vah phayda nahin mil paata jo oobad-khabad ilaakon main maovadiyon ko miltaa he
 "just because of the construction of these two roads, the Maoist area will remain mahudad to a small extent and this will bring their primary defense shield - that is, away from the reach
" maovadiyon ke khilaaf ladaai behad ahm mode par he
 The center's misgivings right here are surprising
 maovadiyon ke khilaaf ladaai ke tareeke main na to koi buniyadi badlaav aayaa he or na ranneetik kamiyon ko dur karne ke liye koi kadam uthaaya gaya he
 The main force fighting the Maoists is the CRPF itself, but since February it did not have a full-time Director General in New Delhi
 siarpief niti, sajo-saamaan, maanav bal or prashikshan kii tangiyon se laachaar he
 As a result, the CRPF had to send troops to one of the last bastions of the Maoists in the country without any preparation and equipment
 ghaat lagaakar hamale kaa nishaanaa banaae gaye siarpief ke javaanon ke paas un upkarnon main se ek bhi nahin tha jinaki bahut pehle 2012 main grih mantralay kii aadhunikeekaran yojana main sifarish kii gai thi
 In the budget of 2017, the Ministry of Home Affairs received about 83,000 crores

 Sukma's contingents did not have any additional equipment — dog squads or mpvs — that would help them locate or stop the Maoists hiding in ambush
 siarpief ko 352 empivi (jisamen ek kii keemat 1 karod ru
 Has) been authorized to buy a fleet, but he has only 120 such vehicles
 is surakshabal ke paas maowad se prabhavit ilaakon main koi workshop bhi nahin he, lihaaja in vaahanon main se kam se kam 40 fisadi hameshaa bekaar hi pade rahete hai
 The matter of greater concern is the issues related to human force
 pichley teen saal main siarpief ke takreeban 7,000 karmi naukari chhodkar chale gaye
 These include 1,085 inspectors, sub-inspectors and assistant sub-inspector officers who lead companies, sections and platoons in anti-maoist operations
 in kamiyon ne jang ke maidan main aguai ko pangu kar diya he
 During the April 24 attack, a single inspector was in charge of two companies, while the recommendation was to have at least five officers to lead such a large force — one deputy commandant, two inspectors, and two deputy inspectors
 sukama kii muthbhed ne aage ke khataron ke liye beej bo die hai
 In just one ambush, the Maoists carried 22 weapons

 The violent armed peasant revolt that began 50 years ago on 25 May 1967 from Naxalbadi, a sleepy village in West Bengal, grew on the back of lack of land reforms and exploitation

 In this new fight against the Maoists, the army is being used only for a supporting role — six mi-17v-5 helicopters of the air force stationed in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand to bring the dead and bring troops and equipment - Carried to carry

 The big twist came after the 2010 Chintalnar attack
 us vakt ke grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram launched a two-stage plan to equip and empower state police forces
 vampanthi ugravad prabhavit jilon main zyada ardhsainik bal jhonko or doordaraj ke ilaakon main kilaband police thane banaao
 The second phase of the plan was to make district officers stronger by building schools, roads, toilets and drinking water facilities in areas liberated from Maoists
 chhattisgarh, jharkhand or pashchim bengal main ek ekikrut cmand banaai gai taaki police, paramilitary or khufia ikaayiyon kii gatividhiyon ke bich najdiki talmail kiya ja sake
 This strategy can be credited to a large extent to reverse the callousness and carelessness of the 2000s
 jahaan sarkarein nithlli soti raheen, vahiin andhra pradesh ke hinsak ugravadiyon ke ek kattar dhade ne, chashmadhari or abujh 67 varshiya muppalla lakshmana raav urf òòganpatióó kii aguai main, madhya bharat ke ilaakon main apana shikanja failaa liya

 IDBI Bank's total non performing asset i
e
 NPA 27 till March this year
 95 fisadi badhkar kareeb 55,600 karod rupee tak pahunch gaya he
 a year ago, it was just 21
 25 fisadi par tha
 Under the pressure of npas, IDBI Bank made a total of 5,662 during the fourth quarter of FY 2017
 76 karod rupee kaa shuddh ghaataa uthaaya tha
 Due to this situation of IDBI, in May, the Central Reserve Bank for the first time selected a government bank for prompt corrective action (PCA) to improve its financial condition
 is faisle ke liye rigerv bank ne IDBI kaa lagaataar paanch vitt varsh ke dauraan ghaataa uthaane ke tathy ko bhi centre main rakhaa
 The central government spent Rs 10,610 crore as a capital infusion to improve the bank's financial condition during FY 2018
 iske baavjood abhitak IDBI bank kii sthiti main sudhaar hone ke koi sanket nahin mili hai
 Significantly, the central government holds 81 per cent stake in IDBI Bank and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made a statement in Parliament last year that the government will take an exercise to reduce its stake to below 50 per cent
 lekin beete ek saal ke dauraan IDBI bank main hissedari kharidne ke liye kisi nijee khilaadi ne haath aage nahin badhaayaa

 sankat main LIC, modi sarkaar ke is kadam se kahin dub na jaae aapke beemaa kii rakamathidhbhi bank ko agle kuch varshon main ek badi rakam kii jarurat he jisase vah apane gande karjon ko pataakar apana lekha-jokha sudhaar sake
 He is not getting this amount by selling stake to any private player
 aisi sthiti main LIC se hone vaala 11 se 13 hajaar karod rupee kaa nivesh bank kii sthiti sudhaarney ke liye behad ahm hoga
 One thing is clear from this deal that the central government has taken this formula to save a government bank from drowning
 is formule ke tahat use apane khajaane se bina paisa kharch kiye sarkari bank ko bachaane kaa kaam karnaa he
 However, this investment will threaten lic's money
 is khatre ke chalate jivan beemaa nigam main padaa aam aadmi kaa paisa khatre main aa jayega
 Economic experts fear that lic's exposure to IDBI Bank will pose a threat to LIC as well as its ability to return money to insurance holders
 yah sthiti ek or tathy ke saath or khatarnaak ho sakati he kyonki beete kuch varshon ke dauraan LIC ko apni policy par bonus kaa bhugtan karne main samasya kaa saamana karnaa padaa rahaa he
 In protest against lic's investment in IDBI Bank, the bank employees association recently wrote a letter to Executive Finance Minister Piyush Goyal saying that the way many banks in the country are struggling with the problem of npas, in the same way LIC also big NPA is struggling with the problem of dirty investment
 21 main se 18 bainkon main laga paisa gata, kya sarkari dabaav main IDBI ko kharid rahi he lic?aisi sthiti main yadi LIC par IDBI bank ko doobane se bachaane kii jimmedaari laadi jaati he to sambhav he ki vah is dabaav ke tale khud mushkilon se ghir jaae
 With increasing difficulties on LIC, it is clear that the most important investment of about 38 crore life insurance policy holders in the country will also be under threat
 gauratlab he ki kisi sarkari bank ko bachaane kaa daaromadar keval centre sarkaar ke kandhon par he
 If a state-run bank has run into the NPA problem due to the wrong decisions of its employees, the central government should take strong action against such officers
 vahiin kisi bank kaa bed lone isliye ekatra ho gaya he ki desh kii aarthik sthiti main badlaav hua jiske chalate bank dwaara infrastracchar kshetra kaa karj bed lone bana he to centre sarkaar ko chahie ki vah apane khajaane se bank ke liye capital kaa intjaam kare
 In both cases, the risk of bank employees' fault or to take steps to cover the economic situation of the country while putting a threat on the money of the common man lying in some other government institution is under question
 yadi IDBI ko bachaane kii yah kavayad sarkaar kaa 21 main 18 biimaar bainkon ko bachaane kaa formula he to kya iske baad centre sarkaar enpie ke boj se dabe 17 anya bainkon ko bachaane ke liye 17 sarkari companiyon par daanv khilne kii taiyaari main he?desh main kul milakar 257 public sector andertekings (piesu-sarkari company) kaam kar rahi hai
 Among these, Indian Oil, ONGC and Coal India are the highest profit making companies for the central government
 iske alaava hindustan petroleum or mangalore rifinary or petrochemicals bhi centre sarkaar ke liye bada munafa kamaane vaali company hai
 At the same time, the Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation and Power Finance Corporation of the Central Government also bring a large share of its annual earnings
 ye sabhi companiyaan centre sarkaar kii top 10 companiyon main shumaar hai
 According to the central government's own data, 257 state-owned companies earned a total profit of Rs 1 lakh 14 thousand 239 crore during 2015-16, while during 2016-17, they made a profit of Rs 1 lakh 27 thousand 602 crore
 in companiyon kaa 2017-18 ke dauraan 11
 Profit up 7 percent
 vahiin maujuuda samay main sarkari bainkon kii suchi main teen bainkon ko chhodkar sabhi bade bank enpie kii samasya se jujh rahe hai
 In such a situation, the question arises whether the central government has prepared a formula to take support of a government company to improve the position of public sector banks in the country and the LIC-IDBI deal is the first example to test the same formula
 kya LIC ke baad centre sarkaar munafa de rahi anya sarkari companiyon kaa rukh karegi? vahiin sawaal yah bhi khadaa hota he ki yadi centre sarkaar ko is niti ko parakhane kii jarurat thi to usne apni tamaam navratna companiyon ko chhodkar sirfichh ko kyon chunaa? kya LIC main padaa janata kaa paisa uske is faisle kii sabase badi vajah he? For the riot victims, hardly any such government has made such a scheme as the Akhilesh government of Uttar Pradesh
 upi sarkaar ne mujffarnagar ke danga peediton ke liye jo skim chalaayi he, uske anusaar danga peediton ko kaha ja rahaa he ki paanch lakh rupee lo or raahat shivi chhod do
 Perhaps no one believes this scheme, but it is true
 mujffarnagar prashasan ne har hatkande apana liye hai, lekin raahat shivi main rah rahe danga peedit shivi chhodane ko taiyaar hi nahin the
 Therefore, on the basis of money, now the Uttar Pradesh government has ordered the Muzaffarnagar administration to give Rs 5 lakh to the families living in the relief camp and go to the relief camp
 is skim ke tahat kuch sharten bhipahali shart to yah he ki paanch lakh rupee kaa muaavja lene ke baad vah parivaar lautakar apane mul gaanv main rahane nahin jayega
 According to the second condition, the family seeking compensation will have to give an affidavit in writing that he will not occupy any government property in any village where he stays
 teesraa yah ki paanch lakh rupee lene ke baad vah parivaar chal sampatti kaa muaavja lene kaa hakdaar to hoga, lekin use achal sampati kaa muaavja nahin milegaa
 The fourth condition is that the family seeking compensation will not return to the relief camp
 ye sabhi sharten maanane vaale hi is muaavje ke hakdaar honge
 So far about 79 families have taken money from this government scheme and left the camp
 philhal mujffarnagar raahat shiviron main 950 parivaar rah rahe hai or mujffarnagar main kul raahat shiviron ki sankhya 5 he
 Now it remains to be seen whether the Uttar Pradesh government will be able to rehabilitate the riot victims living in the relief camp by running this scheme

 That is, the help of a martyred soldier's family is Rs 15 lakh

 If only 15 thousand people put 100 rupees, then the family will get 15 lakh rupees in just 4 hours

 i will get this website and app made with the help of armed forces and permission of the government
 wo bandook taan ke baitha he din raat, agar ye kaam kar gaye to ye sabase bada sailyut hoga

 All eyes are on this match and this match is also special because the match played between India and Pakistan before this match was the final of ICC Champions Trophy-2017
 jahaan bharat ko maat mili thi
 The wounds of that defeat were big for India, to fill it, there will be nothing in his mind except victory in today's match

 In the first match, he had defeated South Africa and in the second match, he defeated the current winner Australia
 teesraa match newjiland se tha, jo barish ke kaaran dhul gaya tha
 If these two teams are talked about in the World Cup, India has never lost to Pakistan in this tournament
 1992 se lekar 2015 world cap tak donon timen chah baar aamane-saamne ho chuki hai, lekin pakistan kabhi bhi jeet nahin paaya he
 This record will definitely give India confidence

 thik usee samay mumbai main rigerv bank ke adhikari yah ganit laga rahe the ki bhartiya videshi mudra bhandar kaa kitna hissaa, kaise yuan (china kii karency) main badla janaa he
 The yuan became the fifth most powerful currency in the world, just three days after India's surgical strike on Pak-backed terrorists
 aktubar kaa pehla haftaa lagate hi yuan ko antarrashtriya mudra kosh (iemef) ke esadiar (special drawing ritis) main jagah mil gai
 It is the elite club of currencies in which only the yuan has found a place after the US Dollar, Japanese Yen, British Pound and Euro
 vibhinn deshon ke videshi mudra bhandar esadiar ke formule par banate hai isliye bharat sahit duniya ke sabhi desh ab videshi mudra khajaane main dollar, pound, euro, yen ke saath yuan ko bhi sahejenge
 We can erase our frustration by cursing the previous governments for the domination of China in the Indian market, but the mockery of the financial markets does not just say that God created the world and what he made in it is Made in China
 jab koi desh duniya ke aadhe se adhik personal computer, do tihaai dividi, avan, khilone banaata ho to maid in china duniya ke sabhi bazaaron ke liye bharat jaisi hi talkh hakeekat he
 The Chinese economy has been created by such changes in the global economy that no one could possibly control
 global arthvyavastha main china ke shikhar par pahunchane se pehle ke itihaas main aisa koi udhaaharan nahin miltaa
 When one country becomes the largest manufacturing powerhouse of the whole world, it dominates the markets around the world
 yah katai naammumkin nahin he ki chini saamaan ke bahishkaar ke mobile sandesh jis phone se bheje yaa dekhe ja rahe hai, vah phone yaa uske purje china main bane hon
 The mobile network that carries the message may have been created by Chinese companies GTE or Huawei, or SIM cards have come from China
 agar phone korea yaa japan kaa he to bhi usamen china shaamil hoga kyonki donon desh china se 70 arab dollar ke electronics aayaat karte hai
 It may be that the unit making the electricity with which this phone is charged, has Chinese turbines installed
 china kii bharat main paith pataakhon se kahin zyada gahari or vyapak he
 Import of firecrackers will not be even one million dollars
 videsh vyapaar ke aankadon ke mutabik, china se bharat kaa sabase bada aayaat electronics (20 arab dollar), newclear riector or mashinari (10
 $ 5 billion), Chemicals ($ 6 billion), Fertilizers (3
 2 arab dollar), steel (2
 3 billion dollars)
 2015-16 main bharat ne china se 61 arab dollar kaa aayaat kiya jisamen sheersh das aayaat kaa hissaa 48 arab dollar tha
 After China, India's largest imports are from the US, Saudi Arabia and Emirates
 china se hone vaala aayaat in teenon se zyada he
 Still, cracker revolutionaries have to keep in mind that India's share of sugar exports of more than $ 2 trillion to the world is less than three percent! China's challenge will not be sentimental but rational
 bhartiya arthvyavastha main china ke dabadabe kaa taaja aadhikarik adhyayan uplabdh nahin he
 The last attempt was made in 2011 when the then National Security Advisor conducted a confidential assessment of China's interference in the Indian economy
 nishkarsh chaunkaane vaale theah1
 China can make prices of its products up to 40 per cent cheaper than India
 bazaar is hakeekat kii tasdik karata he
 2
 bharat ke telecom aayaat main china kaa hissaa 2011 main hi 62 fisadi tha
 Now it will be above 75 percent
 3
 China is the world's largest bulk drug (pharmaceutical) manufacturer and India is 100 percent dependent on China for the supply of apis (active forma ingredients) and bulk drugs
 4
 Most of India's goods for power plants and electronics goods are met by China
 or sabase mahatvapurn5
 China's share of India's manufacturing GDP in 2011 was 26 per cent, to be 75 per cent in the next five years
 yah akalan sahi sabit hua he
 a decade ago, the whole world has assumed that what China will buy will be expensive and what it sells will be cheap
 duniya ke desh is sameekaran ko sweekaarte hue ranneetiyaan bana rahe hai
 In the light of this reality, India will also have to work on ways to reduce production costs rather than boycott and focus on small units, technology, research that can substitute for low-cost Chinese imports
 china-pakistan gathjod kii taraf lautate hai, pataakhe jahaan se footnaa shuru hue hai
 Before his visit to Islamabad last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping called Pakistan the future Asian tiger (article published in Pakistan's Daily Times)
 duniya kii kisi bhi mahashakti ne usamen yah sambhaavna kabhi nahin dekhi
 China's investment in the china-pakistan Economic Corridor is $ 46 billion, which is 20 percent of Pakistan's GDP
 jaahir he, america ne kai dashakon tak saath rahakar bhi pakistan ko aisi aarthik takat nahin di jo china lekar pahunchaa he
 We have to understand that China is the second largest economy in the world
 uske itane bade hone ke baad se suraksha kaa antarrashtriya paridrishy sire se badal gaya he
 Pakistan standing with China is actually more stable and capable than Pakistan which remained with America for six decades
 china america kii tarah pakistan se milon dur nahin balki uski apni jameen par kandhe se kandhaa milakar kaam kar rahaa he
 China's strategic influence derives from its economic power
 deshbhakti ke bhavuk uchhavas thik hai lekin bharat ko apni aarthik takat badhaani hogi, kyonki duniya main ranneetik shakti kaa jhanda ab cargo ship lekar chalate hai, battle ship nahin

 upi chunaav main sharmnaak haar ke baad congress main rahul gandhi ke saath hi ek or naam nishane par aayaa
 That was Congress strategist Prashant Kishore i
e
 PK
 nateezon ke din hi upi congress ke mahasachiv umesh pandit ne ajtak se kaha ki haar ke zimmedaar rahul ke saath hi unke ranneetikaar pike hai
 Who formed an alliance with the SP facing anti-incumbency
 chunki pike rahul kii pasand the isliye khulkar to koi congressi kuch nahin bol rahaa lekin upi main pike ko mili khuli chhot se pradesh ke tamaam bade netaaon ke saath hi party ke varisht netaa bhi naakhush hai
 In fact, all these leaders argue that PK can play its role in propagation, but whether or not to combine is a unanimous decision, which should not interfere with PK
 wo udhaaharan bhi dete hai kipunjabamein pike ne sirf prachaar-prasar kaa zimmaa sambhala lekin us sab par antim muhar captain amarinder singh kii hi lagati thi
 PK, Captain and the state were not dominating, whereas in UP it was the opposite
 pike hi gathbandhan se lekar har faisle ke sutaradhar the
 These leaders say that the extent was reached when PK went to talk to Akhilesh to sort out the screws on the seats in the alliance
