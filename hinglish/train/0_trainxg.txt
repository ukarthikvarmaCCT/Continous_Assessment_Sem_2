 He took the name of jaish-e-mohammed's terrorist, Masood Azhar, and said that Saharanpur also has a son-in-law of Azhar Masood who speaks the language of the same, so you have to decide whether to win the person speaking the language of the terrorist or Prime Minister Narendra Raghav Lakhanpal working as Modi's fighter

 Defending the government over the deaths of children in Gorakhpur, he had said, "children die in August
 "darasal, agast 2017 main gorakhpur ke biardi medical college main darjanon bacchon kii incephelitis se maut ho gai thi

 It is noteworthy that India is the second largest onion producing country in the world after China
 sarkaar ne 20 sitambar ko pyaaj niryaat par roak hataane ke baad iskaa nunatam niryaat mulya 475 dollar prati ton tay kiya tha
 a major reason for the declining competitiveness of Indian onion in the international market was attributed by the union official to its minimum export price and the reversal in the policy on exports
 unhone kaha, is saal 9 se 20 sitambar tak niryaat par roak ke chalate bhartiya pyaaj uplabdh nahin hone kii vajah se singapore ke kai vyapaariyon ne ek maheene ke liye chini niryaatkon se anubandh kar diya jisase bhartiya pyaaj ke liye koi gunjaaish nahin bachi

 swatantraaa sangram main kai krantikari aise the, jinka naam itihaas ke pannon main kahin gum ho gaya
 One such name was Yatindranath Mukherjee
 jo bagha jatin ke naam se jane jate the
 It is said that in order to liberate the country from the British, Bagha Jatin had made such a plan that the country would have become independent in 1915 itself
 agar aisa hota ho to shaayad desh kii aazaadee kaa itihaas bhi bilkul alag hota
 Bagha would have beaten any Englishman if he had seen him alone
 kaha jaataa he ki ek baar unhone ek saath aath firangiyon ko peet daalaa tha
 Yatindranath Mukherjee was born in Nadia district of Bungalow, now in Bangladesh
 pita kii maut ke baad unki parvarish unki maa sharatshashi ne kii thi
 He was very interested in sports
 yahi vajah thi ki unka sharir balavaan tha
 In childhood, he often met Ravindra Nath Tagore with his maternal uncle
 bagha jatin tagore se bahut prabhavit the
 He used to participate in plays
 ek baar kisi bhartiya kaa apmaan karne par unhone ek saath chaar-paanch angrejon kii pitayee kar di thi
 He then enrolled in the Calcutta Central College
 tabhi ve swami vivekanand ke sampark main aae
 Meanwhile, Swamiji sent him to an arena to learn wrestling
 vahiin se unke man main desh ke liye kuch kar guzarane kii ichha prabal hui
 In the year 1899, he went to Muzaffarpur as Secretary of Barrister Pingley
 pingale vakil hone ke saath hi itihaaskaar bhi tha
 Living with him, Bagha Jatin felt that Indians should have an army of their own
 bas tabhi se wo is army ke nirmaan main jute gaye
 Jatin's elder son died after marriage
 ve kaaphi tanaav main the
 Because of which he moved to Haridwar
 jab vah laut kar apane gaanv pahunche to vahaan ek tendue ne aatank machaa rakhaa tha
 Jatin sets out in search of him and he encounters a tiger in the forest
 jise unhone apni khukhri se maar daalaa
 From there, he was named Bagha Jatin
 varsh 1900 menkrantikariyonke ek sanghathan kaa nirmaan hua
 In which Bagha Jatin had an important role
 bengal, urisa or bihar main sanghathan kaa vistaar kiya gaya
 Meanwhile, in the year 1905, the Prince of Britain was in Calcutta
 unke swaagat samaaroh main jatin ne mahilaon ke apmaan se naaraaz hokar kai angrejon kii pitayee kar di
 This incident further increased the respect of Bagha Jatin in the minds of revolutionaries
 is ghatana ke baad bagha jatin ne varindra ghosh kii madad se devgarh main ek bam factory kii sthapana kii
 Then he lived in Darjeeling for three years
 ek din vahiin ke silligudi stesan par unka saamana angrej sainikon se ho gaya
 And in anger, Jatin fiercely beaten eight pharaohs, including Captain Murphy of that troop
 iske alipur bam cond main bhi jatin kaa naam aayaa
 Bagha Jatin, with the help of Sir Daniel, sent many students to study abroad
 vahaan unhen sainya prashikshan diya gaya
 Assistance was taken from nris
 aise hi pandurang em bapat or hemadas ne ek roosi krantikari se bam bananaa siikhaa
 Meanwhile, Jatin was arrested
 tatkaaleen firangi sarkaar krantikariyon se pareshaan thi
 Hence the capital was changed from Kolkata in 1912 to Delhi
 sikret sosayadi un dinon bharatiyon par julm dhane waalon kaa khaatmaa kar rahi thi
 Then a revolutionary was caught and he revealed the name of Jatin
 jatin ko ek angrej afasar kii hatya ke aarope main giraftaar kiya kar liya gaya
 Meanwhile, Jagha Jatin, who is in jail, along with other prisoners made a new plan
 desh ko aaazaad karwaane ke liye yah ab tak kaa sabase bada plan tha
 In history, this plan was known as German Plot or hindu-german Conspiracy
 agar wo plan kaamyaab ho jaataa to hamaara desh ko 1915 main hi aaazaad ho jaataa
 According to the same plan, in February 1915 there were plans to revolutionize like 1857
 magar isi dauraan punjab 23veen kaivalari ke ek vidrohi sainik ke bhai kripal singh ne krantikariyon ko dhokhaa diya or unki sari yojana angreji sarkaar tak pahunchaa di
 The whole plan was rekindled
 idhar, angreji afasaron ko jatin or unke saathiyon kii khabar lag chuki thi
 They were hiding in the village of Kaptipada
 bagha kaa aakhri vakt aa gaya tha
 They were surrounded from all sides
 unka saathi chittapriya us vakt unke saath tha
 Bullets started firing on both sides
 isi bich jatin kaa sharir goliyon se chalni ho gaya
 Before dying, Jatin said in the statement that he and Chittapriya had fired the bullet
 vahaan maujuud baaki anya log nirdosh hai
 After this he died in Balasore Hospital

 Chief Secretary of Delhi Government KK Sharma on Thursday wrote a letter to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's Secretary Rajendra Kumar that the Home Ministry order should be followed on the issue of transfer of officers
 tippaniyan In this letter of the Chief Secretary, the instruction of the Center has been cited in which the order to remove Home Secretary Dharampal was wrong
 beshak kejariwal sarkaar ab bhi is baat par adi hui ho ki grih sachiv ke tabadale ko lekar unka faisla sahi he, lekin ab mukhya sachiv kii is chitthee se unhen bada jhatka laga he
 The Chief Secretary has also written that transfer and posting in the Home, Land and Building Department can be done only after consulting the Ministry of Home Affairs or the Deputy Governor
 isliye ab tak is maamle main die gaye dilli sarkaar ke aadesh nirast ho gaye hai or grih mantralay ke faisle ko hi adhikariyon ko maananaa hoga
 a copy of this letter of the Chief Secretary has also been sent to Home Secretary Dharam Pal and Lieutenant Governor's Secretary SCL Das
 mukhya sachiv kii is chitthee main centre ke us nirdesh kaa hawala diya gaya he, jisamen grih sachiv dharmpal ko hataane kaa aadesh galat bataaya gaya tha
 Of course, the Kejriwal government is still adamant that their decision regarding the transfer of the Home Secretary is correct, but now this letter of the Chief Secretary has given them a big shock
 chif secretary ne ye bhi likhaa he ki home, land or building vibhaag main transfar or posting grih mantralay yaa up rajyapal se salaah lekar hi kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, till now the orders of the Delhi Government given in this case have been canceled and the decision of the Ministry of Home Affairs will have to be accepted by the authorities
 mukhya sachiv ke is chitthee kii copy grih sachiv dharmpal or uparajyapal ke sachiv es si el das ko bhi bheji gai he
 The Chief Secretary has also written that transfer and posting in the Home, Land and Building Department can be done only after consulting the Ministry of Home Affairs or the Deputy Governor
 isliye ab tak is maamle main die gaye dilli sarkaar ke aadesh nirast ho gaye hai or grih mantralay ke faisle ko hi adhikariyon ko maananaa hoga
 a copy of this letter of the Chief Secretary has also been sent to Home Secretary Dharam Pal and Lieutenant Governor's Secretary SCL Das

 The court dismissed the suit, stating that the group had no legal basis to file such a suit and that cases not related to the United States or being a matter of concern would not be heard in US courts
 jaj robert sweet ne sikh for justise (esaje) dwaara daayar mukadmaa khaarij karne kii congress party kii apil sweekaar karte hue aadesh diya ki maanavadhikaar samooh ek vaadi nahin ho saktaa or vyaktigat vaadi kanoonee pratinidhi nahin hai
 Sweet said in his order yesterday that the SFJ had failed to prove that the matter was related to or a concern for the United States
 unhone kaha ki kisi anya sanshodhan kii anumati nahin he or maamla khaarij kiya jaataa he
 Yogi Adityanath is seated on the power of Uttar Pradesh, the country's largest state
 rajya ke singhaasana kii bagdor liye hue yogi ko 6 maheene hone ja rahe hai
 The first fire in front of Yogi is to retain the Lok Sabha seats of Gorakhpur and Phulpur, while the opposition is fully prepared to lay siege to him
 aise main ab dekhnaa hoga ki yogi kis tarah se vipaksh kii ranneeti ko bhedakar bijepi ke jeet ko barkaraar rakhte hai?upi ke siemyogi adityanathor donon dipti CM keshav prasad maury va dinesh sharma sahit swatantra singh dev MLC ke liye nirvirodh nirvaachit ho chuke hai
 In such a situation, Yogi's Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats of Maurya were vacated, where the Election Commission may soon issue a decree for the by-election
 darasal gorakhpur or phulpur ke ganit ko agar dekha-parkhaa jaae to donon sansadeey kshetron main badi dilachasp ladaai rahi he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, where BJP got more than the total votes of all opposition parties in these seats
 bijepi ke durg ko bachaane kii chunautigorakhpur bijepi kii paramparaagat seat maani jaati he, isiilie gorakhpur ko bijepi kaa durg kaha jaataa he
 Mahant Avaidyanath started the process of winning the election on the ticket of the Hindu Mahasabha in 1989, it continues even today
 mahant avaidhyanath gorakhpur se chaar baar saansad rahe, 1970 main nirdaleey, 1989 main hindu mahasabha, or phir 1991 va 1996 main bijepi se loksabhaa sadsy bane
 Yogi Adityanath handled the political legacy of Mahant Avaidyanath in 1998, when Yogi became MP five times, then did not look back
 pichley paanch baar se lagaataar yogi bijepi ke tikat se sansad pahunchate rahen
 Whether it was bsp's social engineering or Akhilesh's socialism, he was never challenged and his winning streak continued
 gorakhpur main vipaksh kaa jeetna aasaan nahimarch 2017 main yogi ke upi ke siem ban jane se gorakhpur loksabhaa seat khaali ho gai he
 In such a situation, to save the fort of BJP in front of Yogi, one has to go through Agniksha
 gorakhpur loksabhaa seat 2014 ke hisaab se kul 10,40,199 mat tha, jinamein se yogi ko 5,39,127 mat hasil hue the, duusari ore espi ko 2,26,344 vot, basapa ko 1,76, 412 or congress ko 45,719 vot mili
 In such a situation, Yogi alone got more votes than these three parties
 is tarah vipaksh ke liye yogi ke durg main send lagaana aasaan nahin hoga
 Phulpur, which was Nehru's seat, and Phulpur Lok Sabha seat, has been the traditional Congress seat
 desh ke pehle pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru phulpur loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladate rahe hai or teen baar isi seat se chunakar loksabhaa pahunche
 bjp's first open accountbjp managed to win Phulpur Lok Sabha seat for the first time in 2014 in Modi wave
 keshav mauryaisi seat 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav jitkar saansad bane the, lekin upi ke dipti CM ban jane ke baad unhen istipha dena padaa
 SP won four times, SP also has strong support base in Phulpur
 yahi vajah he ki 1996 se lekar 2004 tak samaajawaadee party kaa ummidavaar lagaataar jeetta rahaa he
 Before that, the Janata Dal had won this seat twice, while the BSP had won in 2009
 aise main bijepi ke liye phulpur seat ko barkaraar rakhana sabase badi chunauti he
 BJP got more than SP-BSP, in view of the votes polled in Lok Sabha elections 2014, Keshav Maurya of BJP 5,03,564 SP 1,95,256 BSP 1,63,710 and Congress 58,127 out of total 9,60,341 votes
 Got votes
 aise main teenon partiyon ke maton ko mila bhi den to bijepi kii baraabar nahin hota
 It is not easy to maintain victory, bjp's wave in UP does not look like 2014 Lok Sabha or 2017 Assembly elections
 aise main bijepi ko gherne ke liye ye bhi kayaas lagaaya ja rahaa tha ki espi or bispi ek ho sakate hai, lekin abhi tak is tarah kuch hota najar nahin aa rahaa he
 The bjp's atmosphere during the Assembly elections has changed a lot
 yogi ke 6 maheene ke kaarykaal ko dekha jaae to unke paas ginane ko kuch khaas uplabdhiyaan bhi nahin he
 In such a situation, how will the BJP be able to retain these seats

 shivasenaane somvaar ko court se kaha ki ye saarvajanik hiton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue aasthaa or dharm ke maamalon main dakhal naa den
 The statement from the party came after a recent order of the Bombay High Court banning pavilions and canopy in narrow or highly traffic areas
 shivasena ne party ke mukhpatr 'saamana' ke sampadakiyamen likhaa he, 'nyaayalay ke is aadesh se ganeshotsav, dahi-handi, gudi parv, shiv jayanti or anya rashtriya or dharmik utsavon par asar padegaa
 The party also objected that in recent years, many Hindu and national festivals were banned in the name of environment and pollution
 party ne sampadakeey main likhaa he, 'koi bhi 'andu-pandu' gaiyr-sarkari sanghathan (enjio) aise maamalon ko lekar adaalat main upasthit ho jate hai or is tarah maamle ko pesh karte hai, jaise ve bahumat kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe hon or is par adaalatein aadesh bhi de detii hai
 Even the police often appear aggressively in such cases
 kuch gine-chune logon yaa enjio ke vichaaron ko bahumat kaa pratinidhitiv nahin mana ja saktaa
 'in Mumbai, referring to the extreme ravages, Sivasane has written that even though there is no festival here, roads are jammed throughout the year and the roads are narrow in many places
 party ne desh ke anya hisse se mumbai aane waalon kii bheed par ek baar phir nakhushi jaahir karte hue likhaa he, 'kya adaalatein mumbai aane vaali bheed par niyantran ke liye 'permit system' kaa aadesh dengi? desh ke anya hisson se log yahaan aate hai
 In this regard, 'go or come - it's your own house' is acceptable
 'party ke mutabik, kuch gine chune log samaaj yaa raashtra ke vichaar kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karte
 Any restrictions on celebrating national and religious festivals undermine the enthusiasm of the majority
 shivasena ne mana ki adaalaton kaa kaam sabhi ko nyaay pradaan karnaa he, lekin party kaa yah bhi kahana he ki unhen dharmik yaa aasthaa ke maamalon se dur rahanaa chahie, khaskar jab isaki aavashyaktaa nahin ho

 Angered by the ongoing controversy over the performance of his much-talked-about film reservation, Hindi film magnate Amitabh Bachchan has said that if the law says that permission has to be obtained from every political party, every society and every citizen, then filmmaking will no longer be an art
 
 amitabh ne apane blog main sawaal kiya ki bhartiya film samudaay main aisa koi nikaay kyon nahin he jo abhivyakti kii swatantraaa par hamalaa karne vaale ke khilaaf uth khadaa ho? big bi ne kaha ki raajnneetik shaktiyon kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaali nikaayon kii apni vichaardhaara or janashakti hoti he or ve unheen chizon kaa samarthan karte hai jinka antat: unhen hi phayda hota he
 But the artist is a creative person, he has nothing to do with politics
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne ek sanvaidhanik nikaay kendriya film pramann board banaaya he jo in gadabadiyon kii jaanch karata he
 Now a filmmaker will have to go to how many such bodies to pass his work
 amitabh ne kaha ki agar kanoon yah kahata he ki hare raajnneetik dal, har samaaj or har naagarik se anumati leni hogi to film nirmaan koi kala nahin rah jaaegi
 He said that if every person needs approval, then who will be left to watch the film in the theater? He said that the art community in the film industry will always be affected because our job is to make films, or do paintings or write books
 hamaara puraa kariyar is baat ko sunishchit karne par nirbhar karata he ki adhiktam sankhya main log hamaare kaam kii prashansa karen
 Big b said, we should leave it to the audience to see what they want to see and what not
 aapako nahin pasand he to mat dekhie
 If you do not like the film after watching it, criticize it
 lekin is par hamalaa karnaa, film or usamen shaamil logon ke yahaan tod phod karnaa hamaare kanoon main nahin aata he
 He said that once the censor board was allowed and allowed to be displayed by the High Court, there was no scope to do much
 film pradarshit hogi or jo log iskaa virodh kar rahe hai unhen yah pataa chalegaa ki isamen aisa kuch bhi nahin he jiskaa ve virodh kar rahe hai

 This is his first film with Ranveer Singh
 is baar unase kaaphi ummiden hai
 It has to be seen what the film does at the box office
 film kii baat karen to ranvir singh pehali dfa ek pulisavaale kaa role play karte najar aaenge
 Sara Ali Khan is in her opposite role
 kaamkaaji mahilaon ke liye ghar or offis ekasaath sanbhaalanaa hameshaa se ek bahut bada chalange rahaa he
 Many times their efforts are successful in creating synergy between these two, but sometimes they feel frustrated
 sabase badi samasya to tab aati he jab ek kaamkaaji mahila maa banati he
 Being a mother is a huge responsibility in itself
 baccha har choti-badi jarurat ke liye maa par nirbhar hota he
 Even if someone is taking care of the child at home, but all the attention of the mother is focusing on her child
 aise main kai baar kaam main dhilaai aa jaati he or nateeja nakaaratmak miltaa he
 If you wish, you can fulfill both the responsibilities together by working smartly and becoming a sensible mother
 ye tips aapke liye madadgaar sabit ho sakate hai:-bachche or offis ke bich talmail badhaane ke liye puri planning se kaam karen or apana ek routine fiks karen
 When you do all the work according to time management, you will not have to watch the clock again and again and you will be able to finish the work on time and go to your child
 -bachche kaa sara saamaan ek alag almaari yaa box main rakhen taaki aapkaa samay batch sake
 Make a list of your important items and replace them
 -agar aapkaa baccha bahut chota he to apane partner se madad len,unase chote-chote kaam karne ko kahen
 The help from your partner will make your work easier and your husband will also understand that it is very difficult for you to do all this alone
 -bachche kaa khyaal rakhane ke liye aap aayaa yaa phir maid kii madad le sakati hai
 Let the meds clearly explain when to give food to the child or at what time to give him the medicine
 kuch aisa system bana len ki din main kam se kam do baar apane bachche ke bare main haalchaal leti rahen
 - After being a child, your priorities change as a mother
 jo bhi kaam karen, use is tarah karen ki isse aapke bachche par uskaa acha prabhaav pade
 Remain completely loyal to your work as well and try to stay away from unnecessary anxiety and stress
 ahmedabad airport par pichley kuch samay main sone kii taskari main baari badhotaree saamne ai he
 That too, when gold prices have recorded a record decline, the figures of increase in smuggling of gold at such a time are surprising
 2012-13 main ahmedabad airport par sone kii taskari ke maamalon main 5 kilo sona zapt kiya gaya tha, ye 2012-13 main badhakar 10 kilo ho gaya
 But in 2013-14, it suddenly increased to 54 kg and this year i
e
 in the first three months of 2015-16, this figure has crossed 28 kg
 vaise sone kii taskari kaa mukhya kendra ab bhi mumbai hi he jahaan 2014 main 1000 kilo sona pakadaa gaya tha or 2015 main ab tak kareeb 250 kilo sona pakadaa gaya he
 Sources in the Customs Department say that smuggling of custom in Mumbai may have led smugglers to make Ahmedabad a gateway to Western India
 kyonki yahaan pakade gaye logon se pataa chalaa he ki wo yahaan se desh ke duusare hisson main sona pahunchane vaale the
 But Ahmedabad airport is equally caught with vigilance
 sabase chaunkaane vaali baat he taskari ke nae-nae tareeke
 Of the 25 cases the Customs Department has caught so far this year, the highest number of cases were of gold concealed in the body
 custom kamishnar capton sanjay gahalot ne enditivi ko bataaya ki kareeb 11 maamalon main to sona gudamarg main chupaaya gaya tha or jis maatra main sona tha wo sachmuch hairaan karne vaali baat thi
 Apart from this, smuggling of gold is also going on high-tech
 custom kamishnar ke mutabik ab taskar suutakes main vir ke taur par bharkar sona laa rahe hai, electronic saamaan ke transformar main bhi sona bhar kar laayaa ja rahaa he
 According to Gehlot, one case surprised his department, a person brought a microwave oven from Dubai
 custom adhikari ko shaq hua to uski jaanch kii gai
 When you turned on the microwave, the light inside burned, the plate was rotating inside, everything was fine, but even if the custom officer was not satisfied, he also heated the water in it
 bas tabhi baat khul gai kyonki usamen pani garam nahin ho rahaa tha
 Due to which, opening it and checking it gave gold in it
 tippaniyan Custom officials say that due to such new methods of smuggling, they also have to prepare more
 ab sawaal ye he ki sone ke daam pichley paanch saalon main sabase kam hai to aakhir ye taskari ho kyon rahi he
 Experts said that in India on Monday, 24 carat 10 grams of gold was priced at Rs 25,110, while in Dubai the price was Rs 23,000
 yani sone ke 10 gram par 2000 rupee kaa phayda, agar ek kilo sona laayaa jaae to 2 lakh rupee kaa phayda
 This is why gold smuggling is a lucrative job
 jaankaar kehete hai ki daamon main fark kii mukhya vajah he bharat main sone par baari custom duty or waite, jisaki vajah se bharat main sona bahut mahangaa bik rahaa he
 And unless the price difference in India is less than in the international market, it is difficult to stop gold smuggling

 custom vibhaag ke sutara bataate hai ki mumbai main custom kii dhauns badhane se taskaron ko shaayad ye lagane laga he ki ahmedabad ko pashchim bharat kaa getwe banaaya jaae
 Because people caught here have come to know that they were going to transport gold from here to other parts of the country
 lekin ahmedabad airport par bhi utani hi chaukasee se pakade ja rahe hai
 Most shocking is the new methods of smuggling
 custom vibhaag ne is saal ab tak jo 25 maamle pakade hai, unamem sabase zyada maamle sharir main chhupaae gaye sone ke the
 Custom Commissioner Captain Sanjay Gehlot told NDTV that in about 11 cases, the gold was hidden in the puddle and the amount of gold that was there was a real surprise
 iske alaava bhi sone kii taskari hitech ho rahi he
 According to the custom commissioner, now smugglers are bringing gold in the suitcase in the form of wire, gold is also being brought in the electronic goods transformer
 gahalot ke mutabik, ek maamle ne to unke vibhaag ko hairaan hi kar diya, ek vyakti dubai se microwave oven lekar aayaa
 If the Customs officer suspected him, he was investigated
 microwave chaalu karke dekha to andar lite jal gai, andar plate bhi gum rahi thi, sab kuch thik thaak, lekin phir bhi custom adhikari ko santosh nahin hua to usamen pani bhi garam karke dekha
 Just then the matter opened up because the water was not getting hot in it
 jisase use kholkar jaanch karne se usamen sona niklaa
 The comments custom adhikari kehete hai ki taskari ke aise nae tareekon ke chalate unhen bhi zyada taiyaari rakhni padati he
 Now the question is that the price of gold is the lowest in the last five years, so why is it being smuggled? jaankaron ne bataaya ki, bharat main somvaar ko 24 karet 10 gram sone kii keemat 25,110 rupee thi, jabaki dubai main kimmat thi 23,000 rupee
 That is, the benefit of Rs 2000 on 10 grams of gold, if one kg of gold is brought, then the benefit of Rs 2 lakh
 yahi vajah he ki sone kii taskari ek aakarshak kaam he
 Experts say that the main reason for the difference in prices is heavy custom duty and VAT on gold in India, due to which gold is being sold very expensive in India
 or jab tak antarrashtriya bazaar ke mukaable bharat main daamon main fark kam nahin hoga, sone kii taskari ko rokna mushkil he

 Which diary, whose diary
 mujhe nahin pataa usamen kisne kya likhaa, kiskaa naam likhaa mujhe kya maaloom
 Just don't tell me anything about it
 meraa naam mat ghasitie
 The Congress had accused PM Modi of encroaching on the fact that the Congress had released a picture linked to 'sahara Diary' on its official Twitter account, which showed that while being the CM of Gujarat, Narendra Modi raised Rs 40 crore from the Sahara group
 Had taken 'bribe'
 haalanki isse congress hi sawaalon main ghir gai, kyonki saal 2014 kii is kathith list main jis tarah gujarat ke tatkat siem kaa zikr he, usee dilli kii tatkaaleen siem shila dikshit ke naam ke aage bhi ek karod rupee dene kii baat likhi he
 Modi ji, make fun of me as much as you make fun of me, but get these papers checked: Rahul Gandhi pic

 com / rnicmorr4j — INC India (@incindia) December 23, 2016 MP and CM of Chhattisgarh also named Dixit was the Chief Minister of Delhi till December 2013 and this alleged list mentions giving him one crore in cash in September 2013
 is list main narendra modi or shila dikshit ke alaava madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantriyon ko bhi paise dene kii baat kaa zikr he
 Significantly, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has been targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi these days in the corruption case and accusing him of taking bribe from Sahara
 haalanki ab usee maamle main congress netaa evam upi chunaav ke liye party kii siem ummidavaar shila dikshit kaa naam aane se unka prahaar ko kund jarur kar degi
 The election movement in Delhi has intensified
 arvind kejariwal kii amadmi party ne apana ghoshnaa patrajari kar diya he
 This manifesto is huge and tries to shed light on every aspect related to Delhi
 padhein: AAP ke ahm 40 vaadeisamen mahila suraksha se lekar wo tamaam vaade shaamil hai jo unhone apane pichley ghoshnaa patr main kiye the, masalan muft pani, sasti bijli, janalokapal bill vagairah
 There is also talk of getting Delhi a full status
 is ghoshnaa patr main party ne koi bhi aisi cheez nahin chodi he jiskaa dilli se vaasta he
 It has also been talked about reforming bad schools, opening 500 new schools and 20 new colleges
 iske alaava isamen gaanvon ke vikaas or yamuna kii saaf-safai kii bhi baat kahi gai he
 That is, no subject is left out
 kejariwal sarkari karmchaariyon ko lubhaane ke liye tarah-tarah kii ghoshnaaen bhi karte nazar aae masalan unke liye cashles skim or unki umr kaa maamla
 Kejriwal knows that there are more than a million central and state government employees in Delhi and it is necessary to woo him, especially given that he himself stands from the New Delhi Legislative Assembly seat where government employees reside on a large scale
 dilli main takreeban paanch lakh vyapaaree yaa kaarobaari rahete hai or unke liye bhi unhone apane ghoshnaa patr main jagah rakhi he
 Their problem is VAT and raids related to it
 kejariwal ne unki chot ko sahalaane kii koshish kii he
 Kejriwal claims that this manifesto is the result of four months of hard work
 zaahir he jab itane saare vaade kiye jane hai to isamen itnaa vakt to lagata hi
 But after reading this manifesto one thing seems clear that Kejriwal does not want to leave any issue to his rivals and hence he did not leave anything for them
 or isliye vah apane mul uddeshy se bhatakate dikh rahe hai
 His war started against corruption and for that reason he went to know but he has no specific discussion in this manifesto
 dilli ajtak ke chunavi survey main yah baat saaf taur par saamne ai he ki yahaan bhrashtachar sabase bada mudda he
 But Kejriwal, like a skilled politician, is avoiding speaking more about it
 unhen maaloom he ki bhrashtachariyon ke khilaaf baat chhedane se sarkari karmchaariyon kaa ek varg ashankit ho jayega
 But the one thing is that from where will the money come to fulfill so many promises? He has kept silent about how much money will be needed to fulfill the promises he has made
 dilli ek chota sa rajya he or iske paas rajasav ugaahne ke strot bahut kam hai or kejariwal waite ghataane kii bhi baat kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is difficult to understand how the money will be raised
 kejariwal ne ek behad lubhaavna ghoshnaa patr to jari kiya lekin uske peeche kii thos sachchaaiyon se vah kinaaraa kar gaye jo aage jaakar unke liye ji kaa janjaal banengi

 congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi ke uttar pradesh ke aghoshit daure ke tisare din guuruuvaar ko jonpur jile main us samay afra-tafari much gai jab ek shaks apni fariyaad sunaane ke liye unki gaadi ke saamne aakar aakar let gaya
 As soon as Rahul Gandhi left the postal bungalow of Jaunpur with the convoy for a field trip, a man named Sanjay Prajapati came in front of his car and lay down
 rahul kii suraksha main maujuud surakshakarmiyon or jila police ke jawan use hataane lage, tabhi rahul car se utarkar neeche aae or prajapati se uski pareshaani suni
 Prajapati tells Rahul that the land mafia has captured his land
 sthaneey police prashasan dwaara kaaphi samay se guhaar na sune jane ke kaaran vah insaaf ke liye fariyaad lekar unke paas aayaa he
 After hearing Prajapati's plea, Rahul assured of getting justice, saying that he would talk about this to the local administration through local Congress leaders
 baad main rahul ne lallapur gaanv main chaoupal lagaakar graminon kii samasyaayein sunin or centre sarkaar dwaara pryojit yajnaon ke kriyanvayan kii jaankaree lee

 pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne ravivaar ko madhya pradesh main chunavi reliyon ko sambodhit kiya
 During this time, both leaders launched a scathing attack on the Congress and the Gandhi family
 madhya pradesh ke churhat main chunavi jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue amit shah ne kaha ki madhya pradesh main congress ke paas na koi netaa he, na koi niti he or na hi koi siddhant he
 He alleged that the Congress is not a democratic party, which will elect the commander here
 congress nehru gandhi parivaar kii privet limited party he, jiske rashtriya adhyaksh niyukt kiye jate hai, wo bhi gandhi parivaar se
 No one else is made the president of the Congress party
 bataa den ki congress party ne abhi takamadhya pradesh ke mukhyamantripad ke liye kisi ummidavaar ke naam kaa elaan nahin kiya he
 The Congress party landed on the election ground without a chief ministerial face
 vahiin, loksabhaa chunaav ke liye abhi kaaphi samay he, lekin usase pehle rahul gandhi khud ko pradhanmantri kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar chuke hai
 BJP president Amit Shah has attacked the Congress and the Gandhi family for this
 iske alaavapiem modine bhi madhya pradesh main congress party kii ore se mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa elaan nahin karne par tanj ksaa
 Addressing the election public meeting in Chhindwara, he said that the Congress has not yet decided its leader, so how will it fulfill the promises of development made in Madhya Pradesh
 unhone kaha ki congress ke sab netaaon kii apni alag-alag sarkaar hai
 Come to Chhindwara, then go to Kamal Nath government, go to guna-ashoknagar, Scindia government, Rewa to Ajay Singh government, Bhopal to Pachauri government and Jhabua to Bhuria government
 ravivaar ko madhya pradesh ke churhat main chunavi jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue amit shah ne kaha, 'bijepi kii parampara he, jab ham chunaav main jate he, to palapal or pai-pai kaa hisaab dete hai
 He said that the Congress is such an ATM, in which the answer does not come in development after putting problems, but comes out in false promises and BJP is the ATM of development

 Describing Tri Valley University as 'suspicious', External Affairs Minister SM Krishna said, "we will take up the issue with educational authorities in the US on how the university was allowed to cheat Indian students
" " gyaat ho ki krishna ne do din pehle bhartiya chaatro par radio kaaler lagaae jane kii ghatana kii teevr ninda karte hue ise amanviya bataaya
 On Krishna's strong response, US officials told him that only 12 to 18 students were engaged in radio caller whereas more than one lakh Indian students study in America
 bhartiya chaatro par lage radio collar ke bare main puche jane par krishna ne kaha, "america main ek lakh aath hajaar bhartiya chaatr hai or ham ab 12 athwa 18 chaatro ke bare main baat kar rahe hai jinke saath abhadra vyavhaar kiya ja rahaa he
 "he told," i will appeal to the citizens of the country, and especially the media, that we have to look at one lakh Indian students studying in various universities in broad perspective
 " gyaat ho ki tri vaili vishvavidhyalay ke kareeb 1555 chaatro main 90 pratishat chaatr bhartiya hai or inamen se zyaadaatar chaatr andhra pradesh ke hai
 US officials locked the university on charges of selling student visas with money
 krishna ne jor dekar kaha, "hamane america ke saath is mudde ko ucch str par uthaaya he
 Our Ambassador and the San Francisco Consulate are in touch with Indian students
 jaankaar sutron ne bataaya ki videsh sachiv nirupama raav kii america yatra ke samay hone vaali charchaaon main is mudde ko bhi pramukhataa se shaamil kiya janaa he
 Meanwhile, the US has justified the wearing of radio collars in the knees of some students of a bogus university in California, saying that the US has taken the allegations of visa fraud very seriously
 hyderabad main ek software ejeeniyar pati ne chaakuon se godakar apni patni kii berahami se hatya kar di
 After the murder, the accused husband reached the police station and confessed his crime in front of the police
 police ne aaropee pati ko giraftaar kar jail bhej diya he
 The accused husband's name is Chakrapani and he was employed as a software engineer at Hyderabad-based Bank of America
 police ke mutabik, chakrapani or mritka patni madhavi (34 varsh) kii shaadi ko 10 saal ho gaye the
 They also have two children
 darasal chakrapani madhavi setalakalena chahta tha
 Because of this, there was a fight between the two
 jhagade kii vajah se madhavi kuch din pehle apane donon bacchon ke saath apane mata-pita ke ghar rahane ke liye aa gai thi
 On Thursday, Chakrapani rushed to Madhavi drunk and said to go back home
 chakrapani ke hangaamaa karne kii vajah se madhavi ghar chalane ko taiyaar ho gai
 Madhavi left both her children to her parents
 ghar pahunchate hi donon ek baar phir jhagadne lage
 Meanwhile, Chakrapani came in a fit of blows and stabbed Madhavi about 15 times with a knife placed in the kitchen
 madhavi kii maukey par hi maut ho gai

 The police are also surprised by this heartbreaking act of a software engineer
 philhal chakrapani ko shuukravaar ko adaalat main pesh kiya gaya, jahaan se use jail bhej diya gaya
 The government, claiming to be number one, seems to be stuck in the dock on the issue of giving crop compensation to the farmers
 saal 2011 main haryana main ai baadh ke baad sarkaar ne survey karne ke baad kisaanon ko muaavja dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 The government has kept its promise as well, the farmers have been compensated, but the farmers are surprised to see the amount of compensation
 kai kisaanon ko ek or do rupee ke check die gaye hai
 When there was a flood in many districts of Haryana, the government announced compensation for the healing of the wounds of the farmers
 sarkaar apane is elaan par kaayam bhi rahi or saal 2013 main sarkaar ne kisaanon ko vaade ke mutabik muaavja de bhi diya he, lekin muaavje kii raashi ko dekhakar kisaanon ke pairon ke neeche se puri jameen hi phisal gai he, kyonki unhen jo check se baante gaye hai wo ek or do rupee ke hai
 For this, farmers may have to spend several hundred rupees to open an account by going to the city
 philhal vipaksh is mudde par zarur laal pilaa hota najar aa rahaa he
 Now the political war has started on the issue of compensation
 sarkaar ne is mudde par vipaksh ko hi aade haathon lene kii koshish kii he or daawa bhi kiya he ki desh main 5500 rupee prati acre kaa muaavja sirf haryana main hi diya gaya he, kisi or rajya main nahin

 Television journalist Kumar Vinod's poetic anthology 'ekranga' When it came to hand, the first thing that caught the attention was the bright cover of this book
 pile dhoosar, kaale, safed or laal rangon ke sangyojan se anu priya kii manabhaavan chitrakaari vaala behad aakarshak cover
 The design of the book was also different
 anu priya ke rekhachitr kitaab ke andar bhi kai pannon par ankit the
 Kumar Vinod was not already known as a poet, writer or journalist, so there was no information other than this collection 'ekranga' to express him
 kitaab ko palata to jis duusari cheez ne chaunkaaya vah tha hamaare daur kii charchit kathakaar maitreyi puspa kii ekaranga par likhi bhoomika
 Maitreyi Pushpa is originally a narrator, though she also came up with a poem collection called 'lakirne', but she is a writer who is satisfied with her narrative by confining herself to poetry lessons
 jivan kii kuritiyon or stri par kisi bhi tarah ke bandhan kii virdohi rachanaakaar ke vichaaron ko prem kavitaaon ke sankalan par padhanaa rochak laga
 Raised 'ekranga' and read at once
 yah sanyog hi he ki jis pehle kavy-sankalan ko ek hi seating main hi padhaa tha, vah tha prakhyat oriya kavi ramakant rath kaa khandakavy 'shri radha'
 The wonderful narrative of the love of Krishna and Radha is 'sriradha'
 rath ko is kitaab ke liye pratishthit saraswati sammaan mila tha
 So what is 'monochromatic'
 
 Maitreyi Pushpa wrote about the collection 'prem Na Bari Upjaya
 
 
 ' sheershak se apni baat rakhte hue prem par ek vyaakhyaan sa de daalaa he
 From the beginning to the last, his words are few
 'mere saamne kavitaayen hai
 Poetry, which i consider an expression of the heart, because it arises from the poet's inner being
 kronch vadh par maharishi valmiki kii kavyamay pratikriya, prasad kii 'maadak thi mohamayi thi dil bahalane kii krida; ab hriday hilaa detii he vah madhur prem kii pidaa' or sumitra nandan pant kii 'viyogi hoga pehla kavi aah se upja hoga gaan; nikalakar nayanon se chupchaap bahi hogi kavita anjaan
 
 
 
 ' kaa zikr karte hue vah puuchhati hai ki kya kavita viyog main hi samahit rahati he? kya madhur milan kii kavitaayen nahin likhi gayi? phir vah uttar detii si khud likhti hai, milan nahin to bichhoh bhi sambhav nahin
 Love is unfathomable in both
 
 
 
 She then concludes by mentioning the names and poems of this compilation, "in this world today where hatred is dominated, man is a victim of hatred, woman is counted on a low standard, in such a terrible time, Kumar Vinod Prem They make a sound of love, make them suffer with love
 or, phir talash-dar-talash prem kaa yahi amrit to chahie nafrat main jalte- marate logon ke liye taaki unako manushya kii tarah bachaa liya jaye
 It is a must-read book, a collection of poems that mainly keep love intact
 'kya vaaki aisa he? iske liye aapako sankalan padhanaa hoga
 'ekranga' has 118 pages
 paanch khandon main in sheershakon - 1
 Endless, in Your Color, Possibility to Remain, 2
 man ke maun main tum, 3
 For others, not even
 
 
 tumhaare liye jeena, 4
 i didn't want to be your title, yet
 
 
 5
 Finally, yours is a total of 87 poems in Diya, Ekta
 in kavitaaon ko likhane main unhen ek lanbaa arsa laga
 After reaching the publishers with the appearance of the notes in the diary, he got fans as well as critics
 par in sabase itar vah rachate gaye
 
 
 a love poem without any real love
 'ekaranga' kai myanon main anya sankalnon se alag he
 The opening lines of the poem 'rahane Do Anam' in this compilation are - 'listen, now you have started asking / Everyone asks your name / Who is he / she who goes in the impulse of your words / flows like water
 
 
 'ekaranga' main kumaar vinod kii aisi hi bahuteri umdaa panktiyaan dikhti hai
 But it is not as if all the love poems are different from what the poet claims
 kuch kavitaayen behad acchhee to kuch saamaanya, or kuch usase bhi kam
 It is not possible that all the works of any poet are of the same level
 kumaar vinod ise sweekaarte bhi hai
 But in the rush to complete the collection, he should have avoided such a combination
 kahin-kahin pruf kii khamiyaan bhi hai
 Despite these limitations, 'ekranga' is able to grab the attention of readers as well as critics

 Wrestler Sushil Kumar and tennis player Sania Mirza shared their thoughts about Sachin Tendulkar
 susheel aapane second olympic medal jeetne ke baad kaha tha meri sachin se baat karaie
 You had a talk for five minutes
 vah drive kar rahe the us vakt
 In the conversation, i just remembered that Sushil said, yes brother, thank you brother
 
 
 susheel:mere liye dohari khushi thi
 Double Olympic medal and conversation with Sachin
 sachin vaala sapana bhi puraa ho gaya
 Whom i believe so much and talk to him
 sachin ji kaa phone aayaa, badhai di or aashirwad aayaa
 Found after the 2008 Beijing Olympics
 maine pair chhue unke
 He said, you play for the country and did a great job
 main bahut khush tha milakar unase
 Sania you won Junior Wimbledon and Sachin sent you the car
 bataaie us kisse ke bare main
 Sania: i was going to be 16 years old
 junior wimbledon jitkar lauti thi
 There was a lot of support
 ek din ek dost kaa phone aayaa
 He told that Sachin Tendulkar would like to gift you a Fiat Paleo
 unhone signechar kar car bheji
 They did not even know me
 unhone mujhe kol kar badhai di
 She is my best Sachin memory
 ye shandaar he ki kisi 15-16 saal ke player kaa aap is tarah se utsaah badhayen
 Sportspersons have so much media scrutiny, pressure to perform on behalf of people, how do you handle? Sania: We get used to it from the beginning of our career
 magar log vaaki bahut utaavlepan ke saath riect karte hai
 It was many years ago
 sachin kaa form kharaab chal rahaa tha
 Andulkar was the head of a newspaper
 agle match main sachin ne centuri maari
 They have been doing this for 24 years
 jab unhen chukaa hua ghoshit kiya, unhone palatwaar kiya
 Sushil you and Sachin believe a lot in practice and training
 kitna jaruri he pripareshan
 Sushil: Whatever followers of Sachin ji, who like him, learn a lesson
 chaahe vah olympic main hissaa lene vaale hon yaa aam aadmi
 a child, his father, his grandfather, all like him
 24 saal unhone desh ko die
 i only learn from them
 baaki bhi sikhte hai
 Sushil you and Sachin Foodie are also very big
 mujhe yaad he ki aapkaa olympic medal jeetne ke baad maine aapkaa intervyuu kiya
 It was late, so no food was available
 ghar lautakar aapane aalu paranthe khaae
 How to manage fitness worries and eat well
 susheel:chaar maheene toornament ke pehle aap khate nahin ho
 There is a weight category
 to toornament ke baad lagata he ki yaar ab kuch din jamkar kha lo, nahin to phir nayaa target mil jayega
 Question- The private lives of top athletes are also closely watched
 sachin ke maamle main aisa nahin rahaa, kya ye prerana detaa he
 Sania: There are many reasons for this
 yah jabardast he agar aap kar paaen
 But it is very difficult to be a celebrity here and that too a woman celebrity
 mujhe lagata he ki bahut saare athleates ke kariyar aise hi chalem
 As you said, many times i was dragged into the news for reasons other than games
 aise main ye dua or ahm ho jaati he
 His long career is also one of the reasons that stardom was not affected by him
 sawaal: media unke peeche kyon nahin padaa
 Did not peep in private life
 
 
 jawaab:sachin kii family saath thi
 She was a wife
 vah apni niztaa kaa khaas khyaal rakhte the
 Apart from this, he kept performing unaffected by what is happening around
 pichley das saalon se unka kad kuch aisa ho gaya
 That you automatically start honoring them, their attitude, their achievements
 sawaal: susheel, aap log relax nahin kar pate
 If you go to a nightclub, there is a ruckus in the media
 magar sachin kahin jate hai, to sab bahut gres ke saath riect karte hai
 What is the reason for this and what message comes out of it
 
 Answer: Whatever they are
 sachin ko bahut follow karte hai
 Children watch their match in the arena
 unako lagata he ki ham bhi sachin kii tarah pahachaane jaaen
 Everyone wants to be good just like them
 sawaal: hamaare olympic association bain hai
 Sachin is a Rajya Sabha member
 aapaki sachin raajnneetijna se kya ummid he
 
 
 Sushil: He should become the Sports Minister
 jabhi acha ho saktaa he
 Because not just from me
 or bhi jo sports main hai, boxr he, shooter he
 They take everyone equal
 acchhee baat bataate hai
 We want similar people
 wo samaj sakate hai
 Whatever support we need
 unhone 24 saal desh ko die
 Sania: i do not know the sports minister, but we all have to be involved in administration, game management
 sachin ko abhi mere khyaal se ek saal kaa brake lenaa chahie
 Relax should be done
 main bhi game chhodane ke baad yahi karuungi
 Question: Sushil Yeh was a Ranji match with Lahli
 jaraa iske bare main bataaen har koi iske bare main baat kar rahaa tha
 Sushil: Rohtak came to be known because of that match of Lahli
 ab jaise sachin ke liye main bol rahaa hum ki unhen khel mantri hona chahie
 They know what it takes
 hamaare yahaan haryana main siem hooda ji bahut sammaan dete hai
 He is proposing to open the academy to all the players
 isi tarah sachin ji hai
 Support everyone bachapan se sapana tha
 That i meet Sachin ji
 sahaara kaa program tha bombai main
 i met him, touched his feet
 bahut khush tha
 Mother told father in the house
 main aaj yahaan aayaa hum
 i told that i am getting a program on Sachin ji, so i am going, everyone was very happy
 wo sab log bolte hai ki sachin ji ko khel mantri bananaa chahie
 Question: Earlier everyone was talking about Sachin's retirement
 ab har koi kah rahaa he ki kyon ja rahe hai
 Why does this happen
 sania:media ko aise naha dhokar peeche nahin padana chahie
 When someone's form is bad or a match is lost, they know, they don't need your investigation
 magar aisa ho nahin paata
 But now there are 500 channels, if they have to run all day, then something has to be said
 jarurat santulan kii he
 Question: Sushil how do you handle this pressure
 jawaab:mujhe duusare olympic main captain bana diya
 The entire ceremony took place
 baahar aayaa
 One spoke in the media
 tuune jhanda kyon pakadaa
 i said, it is a matter of great pride for me
 wo bole, yaar jisane bhi jhanda pakadaa, wo medal nahin laa paaya
 i said, friend, it is amazing
 mujhe lagata he ki taiyaari se medal milte hai
 What is the point of such belief
 ahm to aapaki practice or yakeen he na
 Question: How superstitious you are
 
 
 sania:main line par step ap nahin karti
 i remain haa, ham sab kisi na kisi tarah se andhvishwasi hote hai
 Rafael Nadal keeps the bottle in a special manner
 sachin kisi ko hilne nahin dete
 Most are, but in their own way
 susheel:nahin aisa kuch nahin
 If you do not work hard, do whatever you want
 nahin jeet paaoge
 You will have to work hard
 shortkat nahin he
 Boria Majumdar narrated another anecdote of Sachin
 mehnat ke bare main
 He told this to Sachin's wife Anjali
 ek din sachin ne anjali se poocha
 What will i do after retirement? kya mujhe practice karte rahani chahie
 Must keep on training
 anjali ne sachin kii aankh main dekha
 He was shocked
 kaisaa jokhim bharaa khyal he
 Anjali said, absolutely your training should continue unabated
 conference audiyans ne poocha sawalsawaal susheel se: aapane sehvaag ko dekha
 You have respect for Sachin
 lekin kya cricket ko lekar aapke man main koi gussa he
 Answer: They also play for the country and we too
 jab unhone world cap jeeta, to ham sab khush hue
 i consider Sachin as God
 wo sabhi sports main kaa bhagwaan maanata hum
 i like Sehwag because he plays smoke
 kya asar hoga sachin ke sanyas kasania:cricket chalata rahegaa
 Virat and Rohit will perform
 magar sachin ke bina ye khel bahut badal jayega
 It will not be the same as before

 — MJ (@mnj256)may 6, 2019 There were differences in the Sangh Parivar on Thursday when the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) refused to accept the regret of Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde for his remarks on 'hindu terrorism', while the Bharatiya Janata Party has agreed to end the case
 
 aresas pravaktaa ram madhav ne twitor par likhaa ki scindia dwaara jaipur main kii gayi tippaniyan aapattijanak or apmanjanak hai
 He has only regretted it
 unhen maafee maangani chahie thi or unhen pakistan ke aatankwaadiyon kii ninda kerani chahie thi
 Madhav said that Shinde should have spoken at least 'sorry' for the comments made a month ago in Jaipur
 gauratlab he ki scindia kii in tippaniyon se unke or sangh parivaar ke bich takaraav kii sthiti paidaa ho gai thi or bhaajapa ne unka bahishkaar karne kii dhamkee tak de di thi
 The statement of the RSS spokesperson contradicts the bjp's stand as the BJP has accepted Shinde's regret
 bhaajapa netaa murali manohar joshi ne is sambandh main kaha ki party ne scindia se sambandhit is maamle ko khatm karne kaa faisla kiya he
 The comments sansad main sambhavit gatirodh khatm karne ke prayaas main scindia ne kal ek bayaan jari karke apni tippanee ko lekar khed jataayaa tha or kaha tha ki unke bayaan ko galat tareeke se liya gaya
 Refusing to accept Shinde's regret, the RSS spokesperson said his comments had damaged India and strengthened the elements against the country but did not say a word about him

 The Ecuadorian government denied on Friday that it had given asylum to the self-styled saint Nityananda, wanted in India in connection with rape and kidnapping, or helped him in buying land in the South American country
 ecuador sarkaar kaa bayaan aise samay aayaa he, jab bhartiya videsh mantralay ne kaha ki usne nityanand kaa passport radd kar diya he or apane sabhi videshi duutavaason ko uske awajahi par najar rakhane ke liye 'avgat' kara diya he
 The Ecuadorian embassy said in a statement that the country had rejected Nityananda's asylum request and had left the country to go to Haiti
 bayaan ke anusaar, "ecuador duutavas spasht rup se un prakashit bayanon ko khaarij karata he, jisamen swayambhu sant nityanand ko ecuador dwaara sharan dene yaa dakshin america dweep main yaa ecuador se dur kisi bhi jagah jameen kharidne main madad dene kii baat kahi gai he
 "according to the statement," in addition, the international private protection (refugee) request made by Nityananda to Ecuador was turned down, after which he presumably moved to Haiti
 " bayaan main kaha gaya he ki digital yaa print media gharaanon se aagrah he ki nityanand se sambandhit kisi bhi tarah kii soochna kaa istemaal karte vakt ecuador kaa sandarbh na de
 According to the statement, all the news published in print or digital media in India was allegedly sourced from the Kailasha Dot Organization website, which is probably run by Nityananda or his supporters
 nityanand ne isse pehle ghoshnaa kar kaha tha ki usne ecuador se kharide gaye dweep par ek hindu raashtra-kailasha kaa nirmaan kiya he
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar refused to comment on Nityananda's claimed 'hindu Rashtra Kailasha' and said that the ministry revoked his passport when he was informed about Nityananda's affairs
 kumaar ne kaha ki sant ne nae passport ke liye aavedan kiya tha, jise khaarij kar diya gaya or pratikul police rapat kii vajah se ise hold par rakh diya gaya
 He said, "we have conveyed to our envoys that he is wanted for many crimes in India, so if he goes from one country to another or lives in another country, we can be informed
 " kumaar ne kaha ki nityanand ke paas 2008 main jari kiya gaya 10 varsho kii vaidhata vaala passport tha, lekin ise 2018 se pehle radd kar diya gaya
 He applied for a new passport, but was rejected
 nityanand ko karnataka main uske khilaaf dushkarm ke ek maamle kii vajah se kathith rup se bina passport ke hi desh chhodkar bhaagna padaa tha
 Nityananda's real name is Rajasekharan and he hails from Tamil Nadu

 It is said that his 'teachings' are based on the teachings of Osho Rajneesh

 Last month, an FIR was lodged against Nityananda in connection with the disappearance of two girls from his ashram in Ahmedabad

 The party alleged, "just as Ashwini Kumar had changed the affidavit of the CBI to save the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's Office, Bansal has been given a clean chit by the CBI to hide the role of the PMO in this case
" ’’ Bansal was the railway minister when Bansal bid for the promotion of the member of the railway board and the chairman of the railway board, which is the largest post after the minister's post and the equivalent of joint secretary to the government of India, the chief opposition party spokesman Vijay Sonkar Shastri said here

 kanoon mantri ne kaha ki raashtrapati ramnath kovind ne muslim mahila (vivaah par adhikaron kaa sangrakshan) doosraa adhyadesh 2019, par hastakshar kar die hai
 On Tuesday, the cabinet gave its approval to reissue the controversial triple divorce ordinance
 tripal talaak kii pratha par pratibandh lagane vaale ek vidheyak ko loksabhaa ne paarit kiya tha or yah vidheyak philhal rajyasabha main lambit he
 With the dissolution of the current Lok Sabha, the bill will also end on June 3
 ek varsh se bhi kam samay main is adhyadesh ko teesri baar phir se jari kiya gaya he
 Opposition parties and some community leaders have objected to the bill, saying that the jail term for a man is legally untenable after giving three immediate divorces to his wife
 lekin sarkaar ne daawa kiya he ki yah vidheyak muslim mahilaon ko nyaay or samanta pradaan karata he
 This will give Muslim women the right to justice and equality
 ek varsh se bhi kam samay main teesri baar adhyadesh jari kiya gaya he
 The bill was missed with the dissolution of the current Lok Sabha on 3 June
 muslim mahilaon (vivaah par adhikaron kaa sangrakshan) adhyadesh, 2019 ke tahat, tatkaal tripal talaak ke madhyam se talaak dena avaidh hoga or pati ke liye teen saal jail kii sajaa hogi
 Since the bill did not get parliamentary approval, a new ordinance was issued
 sabhi ashankaon ko dekhte hue ki prastaavit kanoon kaa durupyog ho saktaa he, sarkaar ne isamen kuch suraksha upayon ko shaamil kiya he jaise ki pareekshan se pehle abhiyukton ke liye jamaanat kaa praavdhaan jodna
 These amendments were approved by the Cabinet on August 29, 2018

 But these days it is being claimed on social media that it was invented in India
 soshal media par ye daawa karte hue ek cycle savaar kii murti kaa photo share kiya ja rahaa he or kaha ja rahaa he ki ye tamilnadu ke panchvarnaswami mandir kii he
 Facebook page 'no religion is greater than Hinduism' Gau Gita Ganga and Gayatri uploaded a photo on 15 November, writing, "there is a Panchvarnaswamy temple in Tamil Nadu
 vahaan yah murti 2000 varsh pracheen he, aisa vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he
 While the inventor of the bicycle is credited to someone else

 But now we will spread the culture of India to the masses
 is post kaa archivd varjanayahandekha ja saktaa he
 In the photo, there is a very beautiful carving on one wall in which a man is seen cycling between flowering plants
 topi pahane is shaks ke kaan par ek phool bhi laga hua he
 Similarly, many more Facebook users have also put this photo and claimed that this photo is from Panchvarnaswamy temple in Tamil Nadu
 india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne paaya ki darasal ye photo bharat kii he hi nahin
 The viral photo is of a temple in Bali, an island in Indonesia
 tamilnadu ke mandir main ek cycle savaar kii 2000 saal puraani murti kii baat isse pehle bhi galat pai gai thi
 For the investigation, we first did a reverse search of the viral photo and found that the photo of the cyclist is actually viral, that is from the 'puru Meduve Karang' temple in Bali
 tripssiviorbali local guidejaisi kai website par yah photo dekhi ja sakati he
 Whose idol is this? By searching more about this temple on the internet, we came to know that this idol is said to be of a Dutch artist who went to Bali in 1904 to roam on a bicycle
 lonly planetpar iske bare main padhaa ja saktaa he
 There is also a Panchvarnaswamy temple
 a bicyclist's statue is a large temple of Lord Shiva near Tiruchirapalli in Tamil Nadu, known as the Panchvarnaswamy Temple
 internet par kuch report jaise kid hindooki report main likhaa gaya he ki mandir main ek cycle savaar kii murti he
 But this idol is quite different from the viral post photos
 kaha jaataa he ki panchvarnaswami mandir ko chol rajvansh ne banaaya tha
 It is also believed that when the temple was renovated in the 1920s, the idol of the cyclist must have been built
 smhoaxslayerjesi kai website ne panchvarnaswami mandir main do hajaar saal pehle cycle savaar kii murti hone kii baat ko galat bataaya he
 When did bicycle originate? There are many websites on the Internet, such as bicycle history and history
 comajisapar saaf likhaa he ki cycle kaa avishkaar 1817 main karl won dress ne kiya tha
 Without pedals and chains, this bicycle had to be run on the road itself
 to jaahir he ki viral photo bharat kaa nahin, indonesia ke bali kaa he
 The cycle was invented in 1817 and the mention of the idol of the rider in the 2000 year old temple is also not correct

 jaraa sochie kisi sanakee taanashaah ke haath duniya kaa sabase taqatvar or sabase khatarnaak bam lag jaae to kya hoga? wo bhi aisa bam jo duniya ke kisi bhi bade shahar kaa minuton main namonishaan mitaa de
 On the birthday of the dictator of North Korea, his scientists have gifted him the world's most dangerous hydrogen bomb ever
 dhamaake se hili dhartipuri duniya se alag-thalag north korea ke sciencedaanon ne buudhvaar 6 janvari, 2016 ko ek batan dabaaya or udhar rajdhani pyongang se saikadon mile dur pungye-ri newclear centre ke kareeb jameen ke kaaphi andar ek jabardast dhamaakaa hua
 The explosion was so powerful that the whole earth was shaken
 uttar korea main 5
 An earthquake of 1 magnitude occurred
 jaahir he ye bukamp dhamaake kii dein thi
 Therefore, immediately after the earthquake, it has been claimed by the neighboring countries of South Korea and Japan that these earthquakes are not natural but they are the result of the craze of North Korea's cynical dictator
 idhar dakshin korea or japan ne ye iljaam lagaaya or udhar usee ke turant baad uttar korea na duniya ke sabase khatarnaak hydrogen bam ke pareekshan par muhar laga di
 It was announced on all TV channels in North Korea
 taanashaah ko diya berthde giftdrasal ye dhamaakaa ek shaks ko uske 32wein janmdin par tohfe ke taur par kiya gaya tha
 The explosion of the hydrogen bomb was intended as a birthday gift, not for anyone else, but for North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un
 darasal, newclear power yani parmaanu takat se las north korea ke liye ye pehla mauka he, jab usne hydrogen bam kaa test kiya he
 This sudden test has shaken the United Nations along with all the countries of the US and the world
 hydrogen bam ke test ke fouran baad state tivi ne baqayda parikshan kii safal kamyaabi kaa khullamakhulla elaan bhi kar diya
 'this is a historic opportunity for North Korea and with all success in testing this hydrogen bomb, we have joined the ranks of countries with advanced nuclear capability
 'kai deshon ne kii nindahalanki china, japan, dakshin korea jaise mulk is pareekshan ke baad se behad gusse main hai
 Countries like Japan and South Korea, as well as the United Nations, have started calling for an emergency meeting after the trial to take a fresh look at the atmosphere
 vahiin america jiyological survey kii maane to dhamaake ke fouran baad kilju shahar ke uttar pashchimi hisse main kareeb 50 kilometre dur aayaa jaljla isi dhamaake kaa nateeja he
 According to the survey, the evidence that has been found in the investigation so far, indicates that the water after the explosion was not natural at all
 parmaanu bam se bhi khatarnakachen riection fusion vaala ye dhamaakaa kitna khatarnaak tha, iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ye parmaanu bam ke mukaable bhi kai guna zyada khatarnaak or tabaahi laane vaala he
 That is to say, a hydrogen bomb can make a big city a crematorium in minutes
 north korea isse pehle teen baar 2006, 2009 or 2013 main newclear bam kii bhi testing kar chukaa he
 Hydrogen bomb is hotter than sun and more dangerous than hundred nuclear bombs
 bas isi se andaja laga lijie ki uski tabaahi kaa dayera kaisaa or kitna bada hoga? bas itnaa samaj lijie ki aisa bas ek hidrogen bam agar ek karod kii aabaadi vaale kisi bade shahar par gir jaae to us puure ke puure shahar ko shmashaan banane main ek minute se zyada vaqt nahin lagegaa
 Two cities of Japan were destroyed by the atomic bomb These blasts of Japan's two cities Haroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 1945 are still the dark pages of history, which make the memory stand tall
 tab mahaj do parmaanu bamon ne japan ke in do shaharon main sava do lakh se zyada logon kii jaan le lee thi
 Now think of that hydrogen bomb which is hundred times more powerful than any such atomic bomb dropped on these two cities
 agar aisa koi bam kisi shahar par gira diya jaae, to anjaam kya hoga? bas, itnaa samaj lijie ki ek hidrogen bam karod-dedh karod kii aabaadi vaale kisi bhi shahar ko minuton main puri tarah se matiamet kar saktaa he
 And this is the reason that if there is any biggest item of destruction present in the world, then it is only hydrogen bomb
 darasal, ye ek kism kaa parmaanu bam hi he or isamen hydrogen kii tarah hi du tirium or tritirium jaise tatwon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The fuse of the atoms causes a detonation in the bomb and requires about 5 million degrees centigrade of heat
 or ye garmi suraj ke sabase zyada garm hisse bhi zyada garm he
 When the atomic bomb produces this heat, the hydrogen atom fuses and the heat it produces converts hydrogen into helium
 kai deshon ke paas he hidrogen bamasaalon pehle 1922 main vaigyanikon ne hydrogen parmaanu ke dhamaake kii takat kaa pataa lagaaya tha
 This was followed by the discovery of heavy hydrogen called deuterium in 1932 and another heavy hydrogen called triterium in 1934
 phir 1950 main america ke raashtrapati tru main nehydrogen bamataiyaar karne kaa hukum diya
 Subsequently a large factory was started in South Carolina
 philhal america rus, china, france samet kai mulk hydrogen bam kii takat se las hai
 But the arrival of this bomb in the hands of North Korea's eccentric dictator is indeed a matter of concern for the world
 america ke liye chunautihathiyaaron kii isi sanak ke chalate duniya ke kai mulkon ne uttar korea se sambandh khatm kar liye lekinkim jongnhin mana
 Countries like America, England, France tried to stop Kim Jong's intentions
 lekin us par koi fark nahin pada
 On the contrary, now after this test, he is directly challenging America
 korea ke news channel kii ankar ne kaha, 'ham apana newclear program jari rakhenge jab tak america hamaare khilaaf apana aakraamak ravaiya nahin badalata
 However, in September last year, the Institute for Science and International Security, based in Washington, had expressed suspicion of developing a dangerous weapon at North Korea's Yangon Nuclear Complex
 think tanks ne satellite images ke aadhaar par bataaya tha ki north korea ne hydrogen bam banane kii takanic bana lee he or 6 janvari ko sachmuch north korea ne hydrogen bam kaa parikshaan kar liya

 Sushil Sharma, an accused in this murder case, is currently free on parole
 lekin uski sajaa maafee par aakhri faisla dilli ke uparajyapal ko lenaa he
 What was Tandurakandtarikh: 2 July 1995
 vaktahraat ke saadhe aath baje
 The place was Government Flat No
 8 / 2A located in Gol Market, New Delhi
 achaanak is sarkari quarter se goliyaan chalane kii aawaaj aati he
 Neighbors thought someone might have left firecrackers
 lihaaza kuch der baad har taraf khamoshi chaa jaati he
 a little time passes
 iske baad achaanak flats kaa darwaja khulata he
 a shadow comes out of the flat, dragging something weighing in polythene
 baahar ek maaruti car khadi thi
 Saya picks up the polythene and puts it in the car's dick
 or phir diki band kar driving seat par baithte hi car ko teji se bhaga le jaataa he
 Time: Around nine and a half hours: ITO bridge darkening was deepening and traffic was slowly coming down on the road
 car chalaane vaala itio pul par pahunchane ke baad teji se idhar udhar dekhtaa he
 He was probably looking for a special occasion
 par mauka shaayad mil nahin rahaa tha
 So after a few rounds of the bridge, he stops his car in the middle of the bridge
 car kaa ingine band karata he or neeche utarataa he
 Actually, he intended to throw the polythene in the car's dick into the Yamuna under the bridge
 lekin pul par ab bhi trephic tha
 People were constantly coming
 lihaaza use mauka nahin miltaa ki wo polithin ko yamuna main phenk sake
 Meanwhile, the man sits back in the car
 or kuch sochane lagata he
 Then suddenly another trick flashes in his mind like lightning
 wo fouran car kaa rukh mode detaa he
 The car now runs back towards Connaught Place
 conot place pahunchate hi is baar car ashok yatri nivas ke andar bagiya restaraan ke paas jaakar rukati he
 At around 10:30 in the morning, some people were sitting and eating food at the Baggiya Restaurant, Ashoka Yatri Niwas, Connaught placerestaurant
 car park karne ke baad car se vahi shaks utarataa he or restaraan ke manager keshav ke paas pahunchataa he
 Actually, there is no one else who drives the car, but Sushil Sharma, president of the Delhi Youth Congress
 or us restaraan maalik bhi susheel sharma hi tha
 Frightened after getting down from the car, Sushil immediately asks Keshav to close the restaurant
 iske baad graahakon ke vahaan se nikalate hi restaraan kii batti buja di jaati he
 But the restaurant's oven was still burning
 vaktahraat kareeb saadhe gyaarah bajejagahhbagiya restaraan, ashoka yatri nivas, conot placesushil sharma ke kehane par restaraan puri tarah khaali ho chukaa tha
 The rest of the restaurant's staff had gone there as Keshav said
 ab vahaan keval restaraan kaa manager keshav or susheel sharma hi the
 Sushil then takes out the polythene from the car's dick
 keshav yah dekhakar hairaan ho jaataa he ki us polithin main ek mahila kii laash thi
 Sushil Sharma then joins the manager Keshav and puts the corpse in the oven
 tandoor thik se jal nahin paata
 Then both of them start putting butter in it to intensify the flame of fire
 yah tarika kaam kar jaataa he
 The flame of fire keeps rising
 aise khulaa tandoorkand kaa rajtandoor main daal kar laash bhunne kaa kaam abhi chal hi rahaa tha ki makkhan kii vajah se tandoor se uthati aag kii tej lapten or dhuen ke gubaar restaraan ke baahar najar aane laga
 Just then, Anaro, a woman selling vegetables sleeping on the pavement, caught sight of that fire
 anaaro ko laga ki shaayad restaraan main aag lag gai
 So Anaro screamed and started making noise
 anaaro kii cheekh paas main hi gasht kar rahe dilli police ke sipaahi abdul nazeer gunju ke kaanon main padi
 Gunju came to Anaro at the same time and then ran towards the restaurant seeing the flames rising from the restaurant
 or usne vahaan pahunchakar jo dekha use dekhakar uske hosh ud gaye
 And in this way, this creeping story of bestiality was exposed
 koun thi jalaai gai mahilarongte khadi dene vaali is vaardaat ke agle roj akhabaaron ke jariye yah khabar dilli youth congress ke netaa matlub kareem ko mili
 Then Matlub Karim appeared and revealed for the first time that the woman who was roasted in the tandoor was named Naina Sahni
 or vah susheel sharma kii hi bivi thi
 It was Matlub Karim who first raised suspicion that Naina Sahni was not murdered by anyone but her husband Sushil Sharma
 haadase ke baad se hi susheel sharma bhi gaayab ho chukaa tha
 Therefore, the suspicion of the police started turning into confidence
 par sawaal ye tha ki aakhir susheel sharma ne apni hi bivi kaa katl kyon kiya? zaahir he iskaa jawaab susheel sharma ke hi paas tha
 But Sushil had gone away from Delhi by then
 ek phone kol ne karaayaa tha katlyouth congress ke netaa se tandoor cond kaa mujrim banane tak kii susheel sharma kii kahani jitani bhayanak he, utani hi chaunkaane vaali bhi
 Naina Sahni was married to Sushil Sharma
 vah usee naina ko tandoor main jhonk chukaa tha
 And that too because of a telephone call
 akhir kiski thi wo kol? or kyon ek kol ne susheel ko kar diya tha pagal? restaraan kaa manager keshav police ke haath lag gaya tha
 But the truth of the tandoor scandal was still not revealed
 police ko talash thi susheel sharma kii
 It was caught like this, Sushil Sharma had escaped from Delhi and reached South India after brutally killing his wife
 usne apane bal munda liye the
 Huliya was changed
 taaki koi use pahchaan naa sake
 But on July 10, the police came to know that Sushil Sharma was about to reach Bangalore court for anticipatory bail
 or usase pehle hi dilli police vahaan pahunch gai or susheel sharma giraftaar ho gaya
 The wife was killed in suspicion after Sushil Sharma told the truth of the tandoor scandal
 darasal susheel ko shaq tha ki uski bivi naina saahani or matlub kareem ke bich sambandh he
 Naina Sahni and Matlub Karim used to study in college together
 youth congress main bhi donon saath the
 When Sushil Sharma reached his house on July 2, the night of the incident, he saw that Naina was talking to someone on the phone
 susheel ko dekhte hi naina ne phone kaat diya
 Later, when Sushil Sharma re-dialed, it was found out that the number belonged to Matlub Karim
 iske baad susheel or naina saahani main jhagada hua
 During the fight, Sushil Sharma fired three bullets at Naina Sahni
 ek goli diwaar main lagi
 And the remaining two bullets had hit Naina's head and neck
 jisase maukey par hi naina ne dam tod diya thaek baar diene or do baar hua tha postmortmtandur cond desh kaa pehla aisa charchit cond tha jisamen naa sirf diene test hua balki do do baar postmortem bhi hua
 It was only the report of the second post-mortem in which it was found that Naina died not from burning but from being shot

 There is still hope for him to improve
 lihaaza ye adaalat dilli hai court ke faisale ko badalte hue susheel sharma kii faansee kii sazaa ko umr qaid main tabdeel karti he
 Date: September 2015 Place: Tihar Jail, Delhi After the intervention of the Supreme Court, Sushil Sharma came out of jail on parole without any condition met
 uski yah azaadi ab hameshaa kii azaadi ban sakati he
 It is very possible that now Sushil Sharma does not go back to jail
 kyonki umr kaid kii sazaa main se baaki umr kii sazaa shaayad maaf ho jaae
 Because he has already spent twenty years in prison
 in bees saalon main kaidiyon ko milane vaali chhuttiyon ko bhi jod liya jaae to chaar saal to uski chuttee ke hi banate hai
 That is, he has been sentenced to 24 years in prison according to the jail rules

 The Delhi government has already advised him in this matter

 yani kul 17 saal
 In these 17 years, Sushil Sharma was hanged twice and once imprisoned
 par ab wo in tamaam sazaaon se dur philhal azaad he or apni permanent azaadi kii raah tak rahaa he

 shiv shambhu aadi or ant ke devtaa he or inkaa na koi swaroop he or na hi aakaar ve niraakaar hai
 The linga is considered the formless form of Shiva due to lack of beginning and end, while in his form, he is worshiped as Lord Shankar
 sirf bhagwaan shiv hi is rup main puuje jate hankeval shiv hi niraakaar ling ke rup main puuje jate hai
 The whole universe is worshiped in gender form because they are considered to be the root cause of the whole world
 isalieshiv murti or ling donon roopon main poojejate hai
 'shiva' means 'ultimate welfare' and 'linga' means 'creation'
 shiv ke vaastavik swaroop se avgat hokar jaagrath shivlinga kaa arth hota he pramaan
 It is found in the Vedas and in the Vedanta and Vedanta the word linga comes to the subtle body
 yah sookshm sharir 17 tatwon se bana hota he
 Mind, intelligence, five senses, five senses and five winds
 vaayu puraana ke anusaar pralaykaal main samast sristi jisamen leen ho jaati he or pun: sristikaal main jisase prakat hoti he use ling kehete hai
 In this way, the entire energy of the world is the symbol of gender
 puranic katha ke anusaarajab samudr manthan ke samay sabhi devtaa amrit ke aakankshi the lekin bhagwaan shiv ke hisse main bhayankar halaahal vish aayaa
 He put that poison capable of destroying the whole world in his gorge and was called 'neelkanth'
 samudr manthan ke samay niklaa vish grahan karne ke kaaran bhagwaan shiv ke sharir kaa dah bad gaya
 For the extinguishment of that fire, the tradition of offering water on the Shivling started, which is still going on today
 gahanon se chamak sakati he aapaki kismatshri shivmahapurana ke sristikhand adhyay 12 shloke 82 se 86 main brahma ji ke putr sanatkumar ji vedavyas ji ko upadesh dete hue kehete he ki har grihasth ko dehdhari sadguru se diksha lekar panchdevon (shri ganesh, surya, vishnu, durga, shankar) kii pratimaaon main nity pujan karnaa chahie kyonki shiv hi sabake mul he, mul (shiv) ko seenchne se sabhi devtaa tritp ho jate he parantu sabhi devataaon ko trupt karne par bhi prabhu shiv kii tripti nahin hoti
 Learn the secret of body sesame
 
 
 is baat kaa pramanshri shivmahapurana sristikhandamen miltaa he is puraana ke anusaar sristi ke paalankarta vishnu ne ek baar, sristi ke rachayita brahma ke saath nirgun-niraakaar-ajanma brahm(shiv) se prarthana ki ‘aap kaise prasann hote he
 'lord Shiva said,' To make me happy, worship the Shivling
 jab jab kisi prakaar kaa sankat yaa du:kha ho to shivlinga kaa pujan karne se samast du:khon kaa naash ho jaataa he
 When Devarshi Narada cursed Shri Vishnu and later repented, then Shri Vishnu told Naradji to worship the Shivling for repentance, hospitality to the Shiv bhakts, and chanting of the name of Nitya Shivshta
