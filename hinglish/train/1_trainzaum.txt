 The steering committee of CBSE has approved the proposal to make board exams compulsory in class 10 from 2018

 Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar had said that the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will meet later this month and will pass a proposal to make the tenth board examination compulsory from the next academic session

 a survey was conducted by CBSE, in which most agreed that the board exam of the tenth should be mandatory

 Officials said that the board has also supported sending a recommendation to the Center that the languages recorded in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution should be studied under the three language formula, while foreign languages should be studied as the fourth language

 If you look at the numbers, then the NDA candidate is sure to win
 lekin har party kii apni vichaardhaara hoti he or uske hisaab se chunaav ladaa jaataa he sirf jeet kaa sawaal nahin he
 Congress has only fielded candidates for politics

 unhone kaha ki mayawati bhale hi kahen ki dalit ummidavaar unki vajah se he lekin dalit hamaare bhi hai sirf unke nahin
 Consider your statement Sonia- Ravi Shankar Prasad: Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that Congress President Sonia Gandhi is saying that this is between the presidential election sharing thinking and the secular force

 If you look at the political equations, the victory of NDA candidate Ramnath Kovind in this election is being confirmed

 After the crushing defeat in the final of the Champions Trophy, questions have started to be raised on the plan for the future of the Indian team
 captain viraat kohli ke netritv main team ne champions trophy main acha pradarshan to kiya lekin final main team dagamagaa gai
 The batsman, bowler, fielder everyone disappointed everyone
 is champions trophy ko 2019 main hone vaale vishwacap ke semi-final ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha, lekin team india is pariksha ko paas karne main naakaam hi rahi
 Even before the Champions Trophy in the team, the morale of coach and captain had lowered the morale
 ab khitaab haath se khisakane ke baad team ke combination ke bare main bhi ek baar kohli ko sochna hoga
 Is Virat Kohli thinking of winning the 2019 World Cup with this team? kya ye team 2 saal baad isi dharti par hone vaale vishwacap ke jeetne ke laayak he
 Top-order fail to all fail? Team India's biggest strength is its batting, but if we look at the record of the past few times, the top order makes the most runs
 champions trophy main bhi yahi haal rahaa
 Opener Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma and captain Virat Kohlipore have been in great form throughout the tournament, due to which the middle order did not get a chance to test
 baad main uskaa hi khamiyaja final main team india ne bhugta
 Yuvraj, Dhoni, Jadhav failed to score
 kya 2019 tak chal paaenge diggaj?abhi team main sabase senior khilaadi purv captain mahendra singh dhoni or yuvaraj singh hai
 Virat Kohli brought Yuvraj back into the team, he also performed well in some matches after his arrival
 lekin yuvi lagaataar acha pradarshan nahin kar paa rahe hai, vahiin unki fitness bhi acchhee nahin he
 The effect of which is also seen on his fielding
 karaari haar ke baad team india ne shandaar khel bhaavana, ICC ne bhi kiya salaamavahin agar mahendra singh dhoni kii baat karen to unki ballebaaji hi kaaphi kam aati he
 But if batting comes, he fails to score
 dhoni kaa team main yogadan bataur wicketiper hi zyada dikhaai padataa he, lekin kya sirf uske dam par vah 2019 tak team main rahane laayak hai

 The relationship between Canada and India has always been complicated
 isse chaahe koi kitna hi hairaan ho magar hakeekat yahi he
 After independence, India's friendship with Canada was largely limited to the import and development of civil nuclear technology
 haalanki 1974 main bharat ke parmaanu pareekshan ke baad canada ne apni urja sandhi kii vaadakhilaphi kaa hawala dekar sambandh tod liye
 He stopped supplying nuclear technology
 aathven dashak main khatas or bad gai jab khalistaan ke liye sakriy sikh ugravadi guton ko canada ne sharan or khuli chhot di, jo bharat ke khilaaf jang chhedana chaahate the
 This increased India's resentment
 1985 main to kadavaahat kaaphi bad gai, jab montrial se landan ke raste nai dilli aa rahi air india kii kanishka flite main bam fata or usamen savaar sabhi 329 logon kii jaan chali gai
 It took 25 years for Canada to admit that the bombing could not be prevented due to its police and security forces
 nauven dashak main sambandhon main thode vakt ke liye sudhaar hua lekin 1998 main bharat ke parmaanu pareekshan ke baad canada ne aarthik pratibandh laga die
 After 37 years, an Indian Prime Minister (dr
 manmohan singh) ne canada kii dwipaksheeya yatra kii
 Before that Indira Gandhi went there in 1973
 tab tak takaraar ke do masale—parmaanu or sikh algaavvaad-donon kaa tanaav kaaphi ghat gaya tha
 Canada finally bowed after India's nuclear deal with the US and a waiver obtained from the Nuclear Supply Group (NSG) and signed a uranium supply agreement for India's nuclear power plants in 2010
 april 2015 main pradhanmantri narendra modi otawa gaye to canada ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri stephen harper ke saath unki garmjoshi se donon deshon ke rishte main garmi ai or ''ranneetik saajhedaari" tak baat bad gai
 Not only did the two treaties of nuclear fuel supply to India be reactivated, but a number of Memorandum of Understanding (mous) were signed in areas such as space technology, civil aviation, railways, health and biotechnology
 aisa laga ki bharat-canada rishte aakhirkaar paravaan chadh gaye or badhotaree kii raah par hai
 But this proved to be cheating
 aktubar 2015 ke aam chunaav main harper ko bade antar se haraakar justin trudo jite or unhen sabase pehle badhai dene waalon main narendra modi bhi the
 The Prime Minister invited him to visit India
 pradhanmantri trudo ne udaarvaad, bahusamskritwad or nariwad ko apane gaurav kaa nishaan banaaya to duniya bhar main unki chhavi teji se rockstar jaisi ban gai
 His cabinet has the highest representation of diverse groups and gender equality
 unhone shaan se kaha bhi ki unki cabinet main modi sarkaar se zyada sikh hai
 However, many of Trudeau's subsequent initiatives have warmed relations and cast a shadow on india-canada relations
 modi sarkaar bharat ke hiton ke khilaaf kattar sikh samoohon se unke dostana ko lekar chintaa jaahir karne lagi
 Trudeau needs to lure migrants of Indian origin, especially Canadian Sikhs, but India feels they are insensitive to his concerns
 rishton kii khai tab or chaudee ho gai jab onterio praant kii vidhansabha ne 1984 ke sikh virdohi dangon ko ''narsanhaar" qaraar dene vaala prastaav paarit kiya
 Narendra Modi and Trudeau have met three times during global conferences in foreign capitals, but the Canadian Prime Minister has not visited India even two years after coming to power
 kutanyik galiyaaron main yah baat nazarandaaj nahin ho saki ki isi dauraan trudo do baar china kii yatra kar chuke hai
 By the way, he continuously sent his cabinet ministers to India
 unke satta main aane ke baad canada ke 11 mantri bharat daure par aa chuke hai
 But there is a crisis of trust
 isliye aakhirkaar jab trudo 17 farvari ko bharat daure par aa rahe hai to ummid yahi he ki dooriyaan kuch ghatengi or kshetrafal ke maamle main duniya ke duusare sabase bade desh or duniya ke sabase bade loktantr ke bich rishton kii barf pighalegi
 Trudeau will be in India for a week
 dilli main pradhanmantri ke saath ek dwipaksheeya baatcheet ke alaava canadai pradhanmantri mumbai main kaarobaariyon se milenge
 He will also visit the Golden Temple in Agra, Amritsar and the Akshardham Temple in Ahmedabad
 modi or trudo kai maamalon main rishton ke pul bana sakate hai, khaskar jaisaa ki canada main bhartiya ucchayukta rah chuke vishnu prakaash jise 3i yani iconomi, energy or ajukeshan (arthvyavastha, urja or shiksha) kehete hai
 However bilateral trade is just 6
 5 arab dollar kaa hi he (canada ke vishwa vyapaar main bharat kii hissedari to sirf 2 pratishat kii hi he)
 Pulses, peas, potash and nuclear fuel are the main items imported from Canada
 bharat se mukhya taur par ratna, jevaraat, pharma utpaada, kapade or rasinic khaad kaa hi niryaat hota he
 In recent years, Canadian institutional investors, especially pension funds and private equity companies, have accounted for around 13 in India
 5 arab dollar kaa nivesh kiya he
 There has also been an increase in the number of students going to Canada for higher education from India
 pichley saal 1,24,000 chaatr gaye
 These are undoubtedly positive events but both countries still have a lot to offer to each other
 bharat ke maujuuda ucchayukta vikaas swaroop kehete hai, ''ham canada ko bharat ke majboot saajheedaaron main ek ke taur par dekhte hai
 "canada's High Commissioner in New Delhi, Nadir Patel, says Canada sees India as an important market
 donon hi paksh vyapak aarthik saajhedaari sandhi (siipie) or videshi nivesh protsaahan or suraksha sandhi (exypie) par baatcheet kar rahe hai lekin trudo ke daure ke dauraan inke paravaan chadhgaye kii ummid kam hi he
 The real matter is the restoration of trust between the two countries
 trudo shaan se kaha karte hai, ''canada hamaare matbhedon kii vajah se majboot he, unke baavjood nahin
 "in his country's relationship with India he must prove that the relationship will be strong despite differences
 unki pehali bharat yatra is prakriya main teji laa sakati he

 yachika par sunwaayee ke baad mangalvaar ko court ne apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha

 supreme court ne kaha ki logon kii sehat, automobile companiyon ke phaayde se zyada jaruri hai
 The court's decision has come on a petition challenging the ban on the sale of such vehicles after 31 March
 adaalat ne kaha ki pradooshan failaane vaale vaahanon ko sadak par aane kii ijaajat nahin di ja sakati

 Subsequently on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing a rally in Akola, Maharashtra, recalled Veer Savarkar, while praising Savarkar's rites and accused the opposition of insulting him
 piem modi ne apane sambodhan main kashmir se dhara 370 hataane jaise faisle ke saahas kii baat karte hue vir saavarkar ko yaad kiya
 PM Modi said, 'these are the sanskars of Veer Savarkar which has put nationalism at the core of nation building
 ' vir saavarkar ke sanskaron kaa bakhaan karte hue piem narendra modi ne congress sarkaron ko bhi gheraa
 PM Modi said that on one side there are the rites of Savarkar and on the other side there are people who have insulted Baba Saheb Ambedkar step by step, deprived him of Bharat Ratna
 piem modi ne kaha ki ye wo log hai jo vir saavarkar ko aae din gaaliyaan dete hai, unka apmaan karte hai
 The Congress raised questions The Congress questioned the bjp's demand for the Bharat Ratna to be given to Hindu Mahasabha founder Vinayak Damodar Savarkar
 congress pravaktaa manish tiwari ne kaha ki main hairaan hum ki ek taraf bijepi mahatma gandhi kii prashansa kar rahi he or duusari taraf saavarkar ke liye bharat ratna kii maang kar rahi he
 In a country where Mahatma Gandhi's murder is being described as suicide, then anything can be possible

 Distributors of newly manufactured LPG gas are falling victim to starvation
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa shikshit berozegaron ko rojgaar dene ke liye alpiji gas agency dene kii yojana puraane gas agenciyon kii monopoli or gas aapurti companiyon ke adhikariyon kii mileebhagat kii vajah se dam tod rahaa he
 In Bihar, 672 new gas distributors are suffering from starvation, but despite repeated instructions from the Petroleum Ministry, the authorities here are sitting with oil in their ears
 pichley aath maheene se in agenciyon ko gas vitaran kaa adhikaar mila he, lekin inke paas ek bhi graahak nahin hai aise main wo gas kisko den
 They have to pay 40 lakh rupees as security in taking gas agency
 iske alaava gas godaam kaa kharch or staff kaa kharch inhen apane ghar se dena padaa he, jabaki bihar main lagbhag 400 puraane gas vitarak he, unke paas 40 se 50 hajaar tak kanjumar hai
 As per the rule, an agency should not have more than 8800 consumers in the city and 5000 in rural areas
 inhen puraane gas vitarakon ke kanjumar ko nae vitarakon main transfar karnaa tha, lekin petroleum companiyon ke adhikariyon or puraane gas vitarakon ke bich mili bhagat kii vajah se yah ab tak sambhav nahin ho paa rahaa he
 On 22 May 2019, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas issued a clear directive directing consumers to transfer to the new gas agency, but no work is being done in Bihar in this direction
 sieji kii report ke mutabaki bihar main 92 kilometre tak dur jaakar gas agenciyaan aapurti kar rahi hai, jo niyam ke bilkul khilaaf or aapurti main bhi upabhoktaaon ko kaaphi deree hoti he
 All new LPG distributors have decided to write a letter to the Prime Minister against these arrangements
 inkaa kahana he ki or rajyon main vyavastha thik kar lee gai he, lekin bihar main yah abhi tak sambhav nahin ho paa rahaa he, is vajah se ye ghor aarthik sankat main funsate ja rahe hai

 He said that Chief Minister Kejriwal had been misleading the public about the names removed in the voter list for months

 Like every year, this time not only America but the world's famous magazine 'time' conducted a readers' poll (online voting) for 'person of the Year' in which people were asked who according to them was' Person of the Year '
 
 is voting main bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa naam sabase upar rahaa or unhone donald trump, hillari clinton, baraak obama, julyin asanj or mark zukarbarg jaisi hastiyon ko pachhad kar 18 pratishat vot hasil kiye
 After the announcement of this result on Twitter, many congratulatory messages started coming for PM Modi, but there were some of these tweets which may not understand the case completely
 twitor par likhaa ja rahaa he ki narendra modi ko 'time person of da year' chun liya gaya he jo ki tathyaatmak rup se galat he
 "person of the Year" @narendramodi Congratulations :) — Kaushik Kishore (@_kaushikkishore) December 5, 2016 # narendramodi congratulation to PM for wining the times person of the year award, 2 and in last 3 yrs INDIA shinning — Dharmen bhatt (@dharmenbhatt) December 5, 2016 Let me tell you that this is an online poll that Time Magazine conducts to know how the world views these celebrities and who they think is better
 acchhee baat yah he ki modi ko jahaan is pole main 18 pratishat vot mili hai, vahiin is pole main putin, obama or trump jaise naamon ko 7 pratishat voton se santushti kerani padi
 Time magazine wrote in its online edition that Modi received the maximum votes from India, as well as a large number of votes from California and New Jersey
 lekin pathakon kaa yah faisla antim faisla nahin mana jaataa
 The thing to note here is that Time has been conducting this online poll since 1998 in which it wants to know from the readers who is 'person of the Year' according to them
 lekin saath hi magazine yah bhi saaf karti he ki jaruri nahin ki pathak jise is tital ke liye chune, use magazine dwaara bhi 'person of da year' chunaa jaae
 If we look at the earlier decisions, the editors of TIME magazine have repeatedly taken the final decision, ignoring the readers' choice
 1998 main jab pehali baar yah online pole hua tha, tab pahalwaan mik foli ko pathakon ne 50 pratishat se zyada vot diya tha lekin patrika ne us saal bill clinton or ken star ko person of da year chunaa
 Foley's fans were angered by this decision as he mistakenly accepted the online poll as the final decision
 yahaan dilachasp yah jaananaa bhi hoga ki is magazine ke hisaab se 'person of da year' ke myne kya hai
 Many people associate this title with 'greatness', but according to the magazine, the title refers to a person, event or object that has had a great impact on the activities of that whole year
 yah asar acha yaa bura donon ho saktaa he, shaayad isliye adolf hitler, joseph stallin or ayatollah khomen jaise vivaadit naam bhi person of da year bane hai
 However, later the magazine escaped the disputed names
 yahi vajah thi ki 9 / 11 hamale ke baad time ne person of da year ke liye neuyork city ke meyar rudolph julayini ko chunaa gaya
 However, there was also a discussion that the magazine pointed out in its editorial that Osama bin Laden is the 'person of the Year' because Al Qaeda's 9 / 11 attack shook the whole world
 
 tippaniyan On the go, one more thing is not always that a person should not always be chosen as 'person of the Year' by Time
 jaisaa ki time kahata he ki vah faisla lete vakt yah dekhtaa he ki is 'person' ne is saal duniya bhar main kitna prabhaav daalaa he, isliye 1966 main isane 'inheritor' yani 25 saal se kam umr ke amariki yuvaaon kii peedi ko chunaa, to 1968 main apollo 8 ke antariksh yatriyon ko chunaa
 In 1982, the computer was chosen and in 2006, 'you' was chosen by all of us, which is represented by the Internet

 De De Pyaar De Review: bollywood aij gap jaise bold vishyon par film banane ke liye abhi maior nahin ho sakaa he
 Looking at 'de De Pyaar De', this is the first thing in mind
 50 saal kii umr main 26 saal kii ladki se ishk hona, bilkul bhi aam baat nahin he
 The director, while raising the subject, forgot that he was building a film about the relationships of three people
 ajay devgan (ajay Devgn), tabboo (tabu) or rakul preet singh (rakul Preet Singh) kii tikdi ke bich jis tarah kii camestry akiv ali ne dikhaai he, vah haasyaaspad he
 The story of 'de De Pyaar De (de De Pyaar De)' is of 50-year-old Ajay Devgan who is separated from his wife
 ajay devgan ko 26 saal kii rakul preet se ishk ho jaataa he
 This unique love story flows throughout the boom
 ajay devgan apni is yuva saathi ke saath apni purv patni or bacchon ke paas pahunchataa he
 a strange story begins after that
 pehla half kuch hansaata he lekin duusare half main aisa lagata he ki diarector ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki jo raita unhone failaayaa he, use kaise samete
 The pace of the film becomes very slow
 screenple bhi behad kharaab he
 If we look at the acting front, Rakul Preet Singh manages to win the heart
 film kii jaan rakul preet singh hai or jab bhi ve screen par aati hai, darshakon ke chehre par chamak daud jaati he
 Tabu has done a good acting, but Ajay Devgan is not very much in this role, and even in the case of acting, he is seen out
 kul milakar unki acting bahut hi everej rahi he
 They can also say that they seem misfit somewhere in this role
 'de de pyaar de (de De Pyaar De)' kaa diarection behad kamjor he or kahani bhi patari se utari hui he
 Although the music of the film is definitely fun, and it is a really good experience to see Rakul Preet Singh on those songs
 film main youth ko conect karne vaala conection bhi missing najar aata he
 In such a situation, 'de De Pyaar De' disappoints

 It has so many definitions and euphemisms that the city becomes something else with every word
 likhanewaale kii giraft se nikal jaataa he
 i had gone to find a Benaras against Banaras, but found everywhere from the same Banaras, which the media had turned into a single story like a tourist guide
 vrutanton kaa ras he banaras
 Actually, Benares is not a city
 yah kabhi tha na kabhi he or kabhi rahegaa
 If there was a city, it would be like Paris, some like Ludhiana or some like Delhi
 sadakon deevaaron se banaras nahin he
 Banaras is from the mind of Banaras
 aacharan, vicharan or dhaaran se
 Whatever was found, Banaras got it
 banarsipan
 Without this, no one can see Baba Vishwanath or Benares
 yah banaras kaa hokar banaras ko jeene kaa shahar he
 It is neither mine nor yours nor it belongs to Benaras
 bahut kam hua jab laut aane ke baad kisi shahar kii yaad ai
 It felt like waking up in a city
 sochataa rahaa ki kya likhuun banaras par
 What has not been written is shahar ke log kisi daastaan kii tarah milte hai
 It is so full of stories that while recounting it itself turns into an anecdote
 milane or bolne kaa aisa romaanch kahin or mahasoos nahin hua
 He got more than what he got
 kam to koi mila hi nahin
 At least we met Delhiites
 sochate rah gaye ki kitna mili or saamne vaala puraa milakar chalaa gaya
 Banaras do not have to search
 kahin bhi mil jaataa he
 We were at the Baba cold shop
 unki shaan main qaside padhate rahe ki har saal aapaki thandai ek mitra se buzurg ke hawaale se dilli pahunch jaati he
 i have been drinking your cold for the last several years
 koi chalis-pachaas saal se thandai bana rahe janaab ne upar dekha tak nahin ki koun he kya bol rahaa he
 Just like any spiritual practice, he was engaged in making cold
 sadhana zaruri he
 Whether you run the country or make cold
 magar vahiin khadey kisi shaks ne kisi ko bhejkar paan mangava diya
 Stated the address of Lassi's shop
 car se guzarate vakt paan or chaay kii dukaanon par logon ko jamaa dekha
 Stopped and watched her talk
 laga ki is shahar main log daphtar dukaan jane ke alaava bhi ghar se nikalate hai
 Went to drink tea in the morning
 bas kisi ne kisi ko kah diya ki bike se inhen park tak chhod aao
 He left tea without looking and left the park
 jinhen bhi jivan main baat karne kii samasya he
 They seem to be unable to reason
 wo banaras chale jaaen
 Will start speaking
 khaaskar tivi ke ye bauraye or jhunjhalaaye ankaron ko har saal banaras janaa chahie
 Radio went to Mirchi's office
 noujvaan jaukiyon ke sansar main
 Such a style of talking that every jockey should pick me up from the streets of Banaras if i just go
 sabake paas kuch na kuch atirikt tha, mujhe dene ke liye
 He has a lot of warmth left in this era
 jaldi samaj gaya ki yah tivi main dikhne ke kaaran nahin he
 The love that is flowing is due to Banaras
 mirchi ke in miththuon se meraa bhi dil lag gaya
 He used to speak like a parrot So calm and calm Aman and Sony by staying
 ek se ek kissago
 In conversation i went live with Vishal
 unke kuch or doston se mulaaqaat hui
 In every meeting i was just looking to meet the people of this city
 kitna milte hai bhai
 In my honor, the brothers set up a stall of chaat inside the office
 tamaato kii chaat
 Wow
 dilli waalon ko pataa chal gaya to har nukkad or baraat main bechakar khatara bana denge
 i know i am not worth as much as i get
 vaise bhi kya karnaa he hisaab kar
 Love is being found in the name of tv's Freb
 main maaya main yaqiin karata hum
 Everything is illusion
 maaya milaati he, maaya rulaati he or maaya hansaati he
 The strap was replaced in the watch shop
 janaab ne koi special zeus mangava di
 Said to drink
 jor dekar kaha ki main chahta hum ki aap peeyen
 This is the real of Banaras
 maine to kaha bhi nahin tha par wo yah zeus pilaakar kaaphi kush dikhe
 So happy that he could not say thank you because of shame
 wo pataa nahin koun ladkaa tha
 At Lanka Chowk where BJP was going on a dharna
 bhayanak garmi thi
 He first brought juice and then bought a Parker pen, removed it from the packet and kept it in his pocket
 kisi channel ke frem main dekhakar wo mahila apane pati or beti ke saath daudi chali ai
 Was panting wo ghar le jaakar khaanaa khilaanaa chaahati thi
 i wish i had gone

 Oops! ajeeb shahar he koi khaali haath miltaa hi nahin he
 Not that i am a TV person, so people were meeting

 We have forgotten to meet the Delhiites

 The students will have to wait a little longer for the CBSE Class 12 result
 dilli hai court ne sibiesai ko gres marks policy jari rakhane kaa nirdesh diya he
 Due to this, adjusting the number of students according to the Grace Marks policy will take some time, which will delay the result
 board ne gres marks policy ko isi saal khatm karne kaa faisla liya tha, lekin hai court ne sibiesai ke faisle par roak laga di he
 a parent and a lawyer approached the High Court against the CBSE decision to end the Grace Marks policy
 unka kahana tha ki is policy chaatro par bahut bura prabhaav padegaa
 The petitioners had argued in the court that abolishing this policy would particularly affect the students who are preparing to study abroad
 hai court ne is yachika par sunwaayee karne ke baad somvaar ko policy jari rakhane kaa nirdesh diya or is policy ko khatm karne ke kadam ko 'anuchit evam gairjimmedaarana' bataaya
 The wait for the students who have given 12th class exam from CBSE is not over yet
 aisi ummid kii ja rahi thi ki 24 may ko CBSE 12veen class ke nattejey ghoshit kar die jaaenge
 Now after the directions of the High Court, it will take time to adjust the marks of the students, due to which the result will be delayed
 aapako bataa den is saal CBSE se 12veen class ke 10 lakh 98 hajaar se zyada students ne exam die hai
 CBSE 12th class results were expected to come on May 24, 2017 i
e
 Wednesday
 sibiesai ne 12veen class ke rigelt jari karne kii taarikh or samay ko lekar abhi koi adhisuchana jari nahin kii he
 Delhi University has started the registration process for admission
 is vajah se bhi CBSE ke students ko apane rigelt kaa besabri se intjaar he
 The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is a major board of school education in India
 bharat ke andar or baahar ke bahut se nijee vidhyalay isse jude hue hai
 Every year lakhs of students give exams from CBSE
 gujarat main 10veen or 12veen kii board pariksha dene ke liye chaatro ko jo 'namo pen' diya gaya he, us par bavaal shuru ho gaya he
 Prime Minister Modi's picture is printed on these pens and 'I Love Modi' is also written along with bjp's election symbol Kamal
 company ne tohfe ke taur par die pentimes of india kii khabar ke mutabik, chaatro ko yahpenek privet form kii taraf se gift ke taur par mili hai
 a school principal in Ahmedabad said that he received 5 to 10 packets of Namo Pen
 har packet main paanch pen hai
 There is also a letter with each pen stating that the children giving the pen board examination have a gift from the company
 patr main yah bhi likhaa he ki is tohfe ko dene ke liye gujarat secondry or hair secondry shiksha board ke chairman aaraje shah or dipti chairman aaraar thakkar se anumati le lee gai he
 Board exams have started in Namo Pen on 8 March in Gujarat
 congress pravaktaa manish doshi ne kaha, 'skulon main 50 hajaar se adhik shikshakon ke pad khaali hai
 Instead of giving good education to children, efforts are being made to give a political color to the education system
 bijepi shiksha vyavastha ko raajnneetik rang dena chaahati he
 Surprisingly, how the board allowed the examinations to be used as a political tool
 'company kaa daawa- 3 saal pehle modi se lee thi anumatiye pen baantne vaali company ke varisht adhikari suresh javeri ne kaha, 'ahmedabad, gandhinagar or vadnagar main hamane 1
 5 lakh Namo pens are distributed
 ' unhone daawa kiya, 'teen saal pehle hamane is pen kaa prastaavpradhanmantri modiko diya tha
 He was then the Chief Minister of the state
 unhen hamaara vichaar kaaphi pasand aayaa
 He only allowed us to do this then
 ' RK Narayan's book Malgudi Days appeared in countless languages and is one of his most popular books
 hindi main bhi ise kai prakashkon ne chapa or baqayada isaki bhoomika bhi prakashit kii
 'malgudi Stories' is a symbol of RK Narayan's amazing story writing, which is interesting as well as educative
 dakshin bharat ke apane priy rihaishi shaharon mysore or chennai main unhone aadhuniktaa or paaramparikta ke bich yahaan-vahaan thaharte jin saadhaaran charitron ko dekha, unhen hi apane asaadhaaran katha-shilp ke jariye yaadgaar bana diya
 But why Narayan wrote this book, its role says a lot and is useful for every writer and literary enthusiast
 kahaniyaan likhnaa lekhak ke liye aasaan hota he kyonki isamen zyaada mehnat nahin kerani padati
 Good or bad novel, printable or not, it takes a lot of work
 bahut zyada shabd likhane padate hai, saath hazaar se ek lakh tak jo pehali nazar main bahut mushkil kaam lagata he, kyonki itane shabd likhane main bahut lambe samay tak in par dhyaan jamaaye rakhana padataa he, aajkal ke hisaab se main chote upanyaas hi likhata hum, phir bhi ek hi vishay par maheenon tak kaam karte rahanaa mujhe pareshaan karne lagata he
 These days, words and sentences keep wandering in the mind day and night, the last words that were written, and what will be written after them, are constantly echoing in the ears, apart from this, all other voices and smells and smells enter the mind
 Can not get it, go back from outside
 jab upanyaas kaa pehla khaakaa bananaa padegaa, shaayad teesraa or chauthaa bhi bananaa pade, jab tak isamen purnataa praapt na kii ja sake- asambhav-sa kaam he
 Then comes the day when the packet of the manuscript can be prepared and sent to the publisher or literary agent
 har upanyaas puraa karne ke baad main nishchay karata hum ki iske baad doosraa nahin likhuga- tab main ek yaa do kahaniyaan likh daalata hum
 i like this work
 upanyaas likhane main jahaan bahut se charitron or ghatnaon kii kaaphi vistaar se soch-vichaar kar likhnaa padataa he, vahaan kahani likhane ke liye ek hi charitra yaa ghatana kaaphi hoti he, ek mukhya vichaar yaa kriya par dhyaan kendrit karne se hi acchhee kahani ban jaati he
 There is no dearth of themes for the story-writer in India
 hamaari samskruti itani vistrut he ki usamen vishyon kii bharmaar he 
 Every man is different from each other not only in economic condition, but also in attitudes, habits and even in everyday life-philosophy
 aise samaaj main jeena or rahanaa, jo mashin kii tarah ek jaisi jindagi nahin jeeta, jisamen ek rasata nahin he, bahut manoranjak or uttejk hota he
 In such a situation, the story writer will get a character on which he will write a good story as soon as he takes a neck out of the window
 kahani choti hi honi chahie, is par duniya main sabhi ekamat hai, lekin uski paribhaasha alag-alag dhangon se kii jaati he- akhbaar ke reporter kii tarah saamaanya vivaran se lekar saahitiyik lekhak ke gambhir chithran-vishleshan tak, jisamen ghatana, charitra bhashaa, abhivyakti, lekhak kii apni vishesh style ityadi anek baton par puraa dhyaan diya jaataa he
 Talking about myself, i get the content of the story on the circumstances of the person in his own character crisis
 is sankalan main di gai lagbhag tees kahaniyon main zyaadaatar vyakti ke aise kisi sankat ko liya gaya he jise yaa to vah jeet letaa he yaa usee ke saath rahane ko majaboor hota he
 There are some stories in which a particular moment appears in the person's life or his circumstances, which is captured only to make a story
 maine is sankalan kaa naam malgudi kasbe par diya he, kyonki isse ise ek bhugolic vyaktitv mil jaataa he
 People often ask: 'but where is this Malgudi?' In response, i say that it is a fictitious name and cannot be found in any map of the world
 yadhyapi chicago vishvidhyalay ne ek saahitiyik atlas prakashit kiya he jisamen bharat kaa nakshaa banaakar usamen malgudi ko bhi dikhaa diya gaya he
 If i say that Malgudi is a town in South India, then it will also be an incomplete truth, because the symptoms of Malgudi will be found everywhere in the world
 main neuyark main bhi malgudi ke lakshan dhund letaa hum : nagar ke pashchimi bhaag main taeesvin sadak jahaan 1959 ke baad main aksar kai-kai maheenon tak rahaa, jahaan basti ke nishaan or logon kii zindagi main kabhi koi pherbadal nahin hua- sinegog kii sidhiyon par ludhakte sharaabi, vah dukaan jis par hameshaa bade-bade shabdon main likhaa rahata he : yahaan kii har chiz hafte bhar main bik jaati he- hameshaa ke liye pachaas fisadi cell; yahaan kii nai kii dukaan, dantist, vakil, machhlee pakadaney vaale hukon vagairah kaa vishesh store or swaadisht khaane-pine ke rahane ke restaraan jaha
 When i went for the first time, the owner welcomed and said, 'you came after a long time
 aajkal aap doodh, chaaval vagairah kaha
 Buy? He did not even think that i was neither a resident of the twenty-third street, nor a resident of America
 yah sab kuch hameshaa kii tarah vaisaa nahin rahata he, iske sthayitv or aapasi melbhav main kabhi koi fark nahin padataa
 And the Chelsea Hotel, when i arrived many years later, the manager welcomed me with a hug and did not embrace me happily, calling his entire staff and introduced me to the lives that were left, walking in the wheelchair - The old resident who was now around 116 years old
 or jab main pichhali dfa is hotel main rahaa, tab yah 90 se kuch zyada hi rahaa hoga
 In this way, Malgudi is a fantasy town but it has proved very useful for my purposes
 or mujh par chaahe jitna dabaav daalaa jaae, isamen main zyada sudhaar nahin kar saktaa
 Recently, when an enthusiastic London television producer asked me to take him to Malgudi and meet his characters to make a good hour-long feature on me, i was in awe for a moment , And could only say so much in response, 'sorry, these days i am just a little too busy writing a new novel
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ’‘yah upanyaas bhi malgudi par hi hoga ?’ usne poocha
 "yes, what else," i said
 ‘iskaa vishay kya he ?’‘iskaa vishay he manushya kii aatma par sher kaa prabhaav
 
 
 
 ’‘vaah, yah to bahut rochak hona chahie
 i will wait till then tab jo dacumentary banegi, usamen sher bahut mazaa paidaa kar degaa

 Media partners, social media people are playing an important role to spread yoga across the world
 jharkhand main yoga diwas ke liye aana bahut sukhad anubhav he
 PM Modi has enumerated three reasons why he decided to celebrate Yoga Day in Ranchi this time
 1
 This state is close to nature, which is why they decided to celebrate Yoga Day here
 2
 Apart from this, our government had also started the Ayushman scheme from Ranchi itself, so celebrating Yoga Day was bound to happen here

 The Prime Minister said that if separate yoga is part of life, then the disease will reduce
 sirf davaaiyon ke jariye jivan nahin jiya janaa chahie, hamen illness se zyada wellness par focus karnaa chahie
 He said that today on the occasion of Yoga Day, an award is also being given by the government

 karnataka kii congress sarkaar ne karadaataaon ke paanch karod rupee lagjri kaaren apane 30 mantriyon ke liye kharidi hai
 The special thing is that many new cars purchased during the previous BJP government have not been used yet
 do maheene pehle hi karnataka main congress kii sarkaar banane ke baad mantri bane logon ko sarkaar kii ore se 14 lakh rupee se kharidi gai nai kaaren di gai hai
 The reason behind the purchase of new cars is being argued by the government that the minister does not want to use the previously purchased cars
 enditivi ne paaya he ki purvavarti sarkaar ke samay mantriyon ko aavantit adhiktar kaaren abhi bhi nai kaaron kii dasha main hai
 All these cars are parked in the government guest house
 carmik vibhaag, jo in kaaron kii dekharekh or nai kaaron kaa jimmaa dekhtaa he, kaa kahana he ki yah ek policy he ki jab bhi nai sarkaar banati he tab nai kaaren aavantit kii jaati hai
 It is clear from this that every time, with the change of government, about 30 cars are purchased from the tax payers
 adhikariyon kii mufeed yah policy berokatoke jari he
 BV Kulkarni, additional secretary in the personnel department, says that this time the same cars have been purchased for all ministers while Toyota's Fortuner SUV for Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has been purchased for Rs 22 lakh only
 niyam ke anusaar koi bhi mantri nai car kii maang tab kar saktaa he jab car ek lakh kilometre kii yatra puri kar chuki ho yaa phir car ke teen saal puure ho chuke hon
 There were three Chief Ministers in the previous government, during which two cars had to be bought more

 inke viipi number or laal batti car ke bheetar padi hui hai
 The comments pichley kuch varshon main mantriyon ke liye car kharidne kaa bajet 10 lakh se 16 lakh rupee kar diya gaya he
 Even former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda has been given a fortune of 22 lakh earlier this year
 aakhir karadaataaon ke rupayon kii aisi phijulkharchi kyon hoti he is baat kaa jawaab kisi ke paas nahin he
 Two months ago, after the formation of the Congress government in Karnataka, people who became ministers have been given new cars purchased by the government for Rs 14 lakh

 Reacting to the opposition's criticism of the government's decision to bring an ordinance to implement the Food Security Bill, Union Minister Manish Tiwari alleged that the opposition is shedding crocodile tears over parliamentary courtesy
 soochna or prasaaran mantri ne pichley satron main sansad kii kaarywahi baadhit hone kaa zikr karte hue kaha, ‘yah vaaki haasyaaspad he ki jo log shishtataa ke naam par ghadiyaali aansu baha rahe hai, unheen ne avrodh paidaa karne main piechdi kar rakhi he
 Apparently referring to the BJP, Manish Tiwari said that the opposition has not shown any respect for parliamentary traditions and it was due to its stance that the two sessions of Parliament were left vacant
 manish tiwari ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘khaadya suraksha adhyadesh ke sambandh main moolbhoot sawaalon yaa moolbhoot aalochanaon par jawaab tabhi diya ja saktaa he, jab raashtrapati ise lagu kar den
 But i laugh that who are the people who are talking about parliamentary courtesans, who are showing concern about the session of Parliament
 ’manish tiwari ne kaha, ‘kya ham sabhi ko november, 2010 main hua sansad satr yaad nahin jo puri tarah hangaame kii bhent chadh gaya tha
 Don't we remember last year's monsoon session which was completely noisy? ’khaadya suraksha vidheyak ko lagu karne ke liye adhyadesh laane ke sarkaar ke faisle kii bijepi or vamadalon samet sabhi bade vipakshi dalon ne aalochana kii he
 The Samajwadi Party, which is supporting the government from outside, has also accused the government of hurrying
 jet-aitihaad qaraar se jude sawaal par manish tiwari ne kaha ki sarkaar ne sabhi binduon par vichaar karne ke baad faisle liye
 He said, 'when you take leniency in the economic field, obviously people come and present their views
 jab sarkaar koi nirnay leti he to sabhi sambhavit binduon par vichaar karti he or rashtriya hit main sarvshereshth sambhavit nirnay par pahunchati he

 In the presence of all the security personnel, a man in police uniform got down from the auto and reached inside the jail

 ) dilli uniwarsity ke north campus main haal hi main dusu president amit tanwar ko khuleam rifl ke saath photo ke liye poj dete dekha gaya
 Not only this, these photos have also been posted on social media
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki yah photo seshan dusu president amit tanwar ke bhai pradeep tanwar kii memorial sarvice ke dauraan hua
 The photo can be seen posing with friends Amit Tanwar, who recently became the Delhi University Student Union (DUSU) president
 is tasveeron ko unke doston ne puure tashan main garv ke saath soshal media par post bhi kiya he
 These pictures have been taken at the DUSU office on the North Campus
 aapako bataa den ki uniwarsity niyamon ke mutabik campus main kisi bhi bandook ko le jane kii sakht manaahi he
 When questions were asked to the dean of the university, JM Khurana, he said that i have no such information
 agar aisa hota he to is par karwai kii jaaegi
 When asked by the DUSU President, the answer was that the guns shown in the pictures belonged to the Personal Security Officer
 lekin sawaal to ye he ki campus main security officer ko itani sari banduukon kii kya jarurat pad gai or is photoshute ko karaane ke saath niyamon ko saream taak par khud adhyaksh ne kyon rakh diya? The Delhi Police's conversation with Anna Hazare has failed
 anna ko raji karne ke liye dilli police ke adhikari tihaad gaye the lekin wo khaali haath baahar laute hai
 Actually, Anna does not agree with the Delhi Police's offer for the fasting deadline
 anna hajaare ke samarthan main sadak par utari desh kii janatadilli police ne anshan ke liye anna ko ramlila maidan dene kii peshkash to kii, lekin is shart par anna saat din hi anshan karenge
 However, it is also worth mentioning that this time limit can be extended after reviewing the situation
 lekin, anna is peshkash par dastakhat karne ko taiyaar nahin
 See how Anna hazareannna is wanted for at least 30 days
 anna ke tevar se saaf he ki unhen dilli police par bharosa nahin
 They feel that once agreed upon for seven days, the Delhi Police can use it unnecessarily
 halaat kharaab bataakar saat din baad unke anshan kii manjuuri radd kar sakati he
 Why is Anna Hazare not coming out of Tihar Jail? What screws are trapped between Delhi Police and Anna Hazare, due to which Anna is not ready to get out of Tihar
 dekhie anna par loksabhaa main pradhanmantri ne kya bayaan diyakhabaron ke mutabik pench anshan kii samay seemaa ko lekar fansaa hua he
 Delhi Police is ready to allow Anna to go on a fast for seven to ten days at Ramlila Maidan
 yahaan tak halaat kii samiksha ke baad dilli police ne is samay seemaa ko badhaane kaa bhi bharosa diya he
 However, Anna is not ready to sign the offer
 wo kam se kam tees din kaa vakt chaahate hai
 There are reports that all the members of Team Anna were agreeable to the offer of Delhi Police but Arvind Kejriwal did not agree on this
 isi vajah se maamla atak gaya
 In view of the attitude of Anna Hazare and his supporters, Delhi Police took a complete U-turn today
 dekhen: dilli main tihaad jail ke baahar umada logon kaa hujuvanna ne jepi park kii jagah anshan ke liye bade maidan kii maang kii thi
 Delhi Police gave Ramlila grounds
 yahi nahin, anshan ke liye aane vaale logon kii sankhya par koi pabandi naa ho, ise bhi dilli police ne maan liya
 Meanwhile, Kiran Bedi addressed the protesters regarding the inconvenience caused to the inmates of Tihar Jail due to Anna's agitation
 unhone logon se apil kii ki wo get number teen khaali kar den kyonki ye raste jail main kaidiyon ke liye doodh, sabji or rasad pahunchane kaa he
 Due to the crowd, no goods have gone inside the jail since Tuesday, causing inconvenience to the prisoners
 dekhen kya he centre sarkaar kaa lokapal draftudhar buudhvaar der shaam anna or police ke bich baatcheet samaapt hone kaa baad yah khabar ai ki anna kii tabiyat kharaab ho gai he or unhone seene main dard kii shikaayat kii he

 According to the 2011 census, where the density of population of the country is 382 persons per square kilometer, the density of population in Bihar is three times more than 1102 persons per square kilometer

 gunaah karne vaale mujarimon ko sajaa dene ke liye jail main rakhaa jaataa he
 The motive is also that the perpetrator should not commit any crime while staying outside
 magar jab jail hi gunahon kaa adda ban jaae or sarkaar kahe ki ham kya karen
 Then the question arises as to what the government means
 yahi hakeekat he punjab kii, jahaan sarkaar jelon main band aparaadhiyon ke saamne bebas or laachaar najar aa rahi he
 The bitter truth of the prison: There are such crimes in the prisons of Punjab, on hearing of which you will be blown away
 jailkaidiyon par lagaam lagane ke liye hoti hai lekin punjab kii jelon main baithkar gangster kanoon or niyamon kii dhajjiyaan uda rahe hai
 Narwana gang miscreants talk on mobile in Bathinda jail
 to sangrur kii jail main gangster gurjeet bhaati kek katkar janmdin manaata he
 Somewhere in the Patiala Jail, the gangsters of Lawrence gang sit in the car of the policemen and take pictures on their mobiles in front of them
 to kahin jail main hathiyaaron kii numaaish kii jaati he
 This is the bitter truth of Punjab jails
 jail main soshal media kaa istemaalapunjab kii jelon main salaakhon ke peeche itnaa sabakuch ho rahaa he ki dekhne vaale hairaan rah jaaen
 From the pictures taken till date, it is clear how much freedom has been given to the prisoners in Punjab jails
 isi kaa ek or bada udhaaharan he bathinda main sakriy shera khabba gang ke ek badmaash vicky kaa fasebuk acanut
 Gangster-turned-politician Jaswinder Rocky was assassinated on 30 April
 usee ke baad vicky ne baqayada fasebuk post ke zarie purv gangster rocky kii hatya kii zimmedaari lee
 Hegangstervikki Gounder was also seen on Facebook challenging the SSP of the district
 desh kii suraksha ke liye khatra hai punjab kii jelhakakeet to yah he ki punjab kii jelon main baithkar gangster baahar kii duniya main gunahon ko anjaam de rahe hai
 Because of this, not only the police but also the army is upset
 pathankot hamale ke baad khufia agenciyon ne ek report taiyaar kii he
 In this report, Military Intelligence has said that many jails of Punjab can prove to be a big threat to the security of the country
 saamne ain tasviren is haqiqat ko benakaab bhi karti hai
 Surprisingly, the Punjab government is sitting behind the bars and questioning the Center instead of stopping the perpetrators of the crimes
 sarkaar ke liye chunauti bane gangpunjab kii jelon main band gangsters ne aam logon kaa jeena muhaal kar rakhaa he
 All crimes are carried out at the behest of miscreants sitting behind bars
 or badal sarkaar inhen roak paane main naakaam sabit ho rahi he
 Shera Khabba Gang of Bathinda, Gurjit Bhati Gang of Sangrur, Narwana Gang of Bathinda, Sukkha Kahlo Gang of Kapurthala and Lawrence Gang of Patiala are openly defying law and government
 bathinda jail main band vicky gounder ne fasebuk post ke zarie katl kii baat kabool kii or hatya karwaane kaa daawa kiya
 Four years ago, the crook of the Shera Khabba gang was killed in the Gursheed Singh encounter
 shera khabba gang ko encounter karwaane kaa shaq jasvindar rocky gang par tha
 Both of these gangs used Facebook in jail
 jail adhikari hai badmaashon ke madadgaarajab gangster jasvindar rocky kii hatya ne ek baar phir punjab kii jelon main badhate gunahon kii taraf ishaara kiya
 So on May 1, a team of 100 police raided the Bathinda jail
 do ghante tak jail kii saghan talaashi lee gai
 But during this search operation, police found only one mobile phone
 iske baad jail prashasan par badmaashon kii madad karne kaa aarope laga
 Offensive items were removed from prison before the raid
 jail prashasan or gangsters kii mileebhagat kaa ek or namoona dekhne ko mila
 The gangsters who are in jail are fearless, drugs trafficking, kidnapping, contract killing and extortion are flourishing in Punjab jails
 khabar he ki bade gangster mobile phone, internet or tamaam suvidhaayen jail prashasan ke zarie hasil karte hai
 How unaware the gangs and gangsters associated with them are in Punjab's jails shows that on April 2015, Gurjit Singh Bhati uploaded his picture on Facebook from Sangrur jail
 sangrur jail main band gurjeet bhaati gang par ek vyapaaree se 8 lakh phiroti maangane kaa aarope he
 Earlier in March 2015, Kulbir Singh of Narwana Gang posted his pictures on Facebook
 disambar 2014 main gangster gurprit shekhon ne jail se 10 lakh kii phiroti maangi thi
 Sukkah Kahlon gang miscreants in Kapurthala jail have often used Facebook
 yah baat to tay he ki punjab main hone vaale bade gunahon main jail main band gangsters kaa haath hota he
 According to the security agencies, now these gangs are proving to be a threat not only to the common man and the Punjab government, but to the security of the entire country

 This is the first time since the budget that gold is being sold at a premium in the country, which was at a 4% discount till the middle of last month
 premium discount ko aasaan bhashaa main aise samajha ja saktaa he ki desh main sona emport karne vaale ayatak bade sarrapha kaarobaariyon ko pehle sona kuch discount ke saath de rahe the jo ab nahin de rahe balki kuch mahangaa karke de rahe hai
 First, understand why this happens? Actually, importers import gold into the country throughout the year and bullion traders also buy gold from them continuously
 bazaar main maang kamjor hone par yaa bhavishya main sone kii keemton main jab giravat kii ashanka gaharaati he to ayatak sone ko discount ke saath bechnaa shuru kar dete hai, lekin jaise hi acchhee maang yaa gharelu or vaishvik sanketon ke kaaran sone main teji kii ummid banati he to yah discount premium main badal jaataa he
 When the discount gets more then bullion traders also give its benefit to the customers
 ab ek sawaal yah bhi khadaa hota he ki sone kii keemat yaa to hajir bazaar main tay hoti he yaa vaayada bazaar yani multi camodity exange par bhi discount or premium kis rate par diya jaataa he
 Let us know that the base price of discount and premium is decided on the basis of London Bullion Market Association
 kedia camodity ke prabandh nideshak ajay kedia kehete hai, ‘’is samay disambar or march ke vaayada main bhi bilkul antar nahin he
 Whereas in general it trades at Rs 300 more
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki bazaar ko ummid he ki sarkaar sone ke aayaat shulk main katautee karegi jiske kaaran bhav main kami aegi’’ aise main kyonki bhav bhavishya main kar katautee ke kaaran kam hone kii ummid he to premium khatm ho gaya
 For the first time after the budget in the spot market, gold is trading at a premium of around 1 per cent
 iskaa zikr karte hue kedia kehete hai, ‘’sone main aane vaale dinon main teji ummid he
 Gold has given a return of about 20 percent this year
 lekin isamen asal teji maatr 12 – 12
 5 percent
 shesh 2
 The 5 per cent import duty has come due to increase and weakening of the rupee
 ’’ sone kii aitihaasik teji yah bataati he ki kabhi gold kii teji ek saal main nahin thami yah trend agle 2 se 3 saal barkaraar rah saktaa he
 This is the reason why despite weak domestic demand, gold is trading at a premium
 maang kamjor ke baad teji kyon?dhanteras or diwali ke dauraan sone ke kaarobaar main 40 fisadi tak kii giravat ke anumaan saamne aae
 Recession, unemployment and the crisis in rural areas also indicate weak gold demand
 lekin phir kya vajah he ki itani sust maang ke baad bhi sone main teji ke anumaan lagaae ja rahe hai
 Kedia explains, "the price of gold in the Indian market gets direction from the global market itself
" fedral rigerv kii ore se 11 saal baad byaaj daron main katautee yah darshata he ki america arthvyavastha dikkat main he
 "gold is the first choice of investors for safe investment
" aise main byaaj daron main katautee ke baad sone main chamak badhanaa laazmi he
 Apart from this, Jio Political Tension, New Year Celebration starting in China are all the signs that are pushing the rise in gold prices
 vaishvik bazaar main sone kii teji bharat main bhi sone ko mahangaa kar detii he
 That is, there are more global reasons for the rise in gold than domestic demand
 gharelu str par bhi bachat par ghatate byaaj or arthvyavastha ke mandi main funsane par niveshkon ke paas bhi sone kaa hi vikalp bachegaa
 Also, the weakness of the rupee can also become a major reason for the boom

 ) Former captain Rahul Dravid has said that India's success in the five-test series starting on July 9 in England will depend to a large extent on how his bowlers perform in the series
 merilborn cricket ground (emsiji) ke 200 baras puure hone ke maukey par emsisi ekadash kii ore se shesh bharat kii ore se khel rahe dravid ne lards par kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki mahatvapurn 20 wicket hasil karne kii kshamta he

 Dravid said fast bowler Zaheer Khan and now retired leg-spinner Anil Kumble played a key role in India's victory in the previous series
 jahir chot ke kaaran maujuuda shrunkhlaa kaa hissaa nahin hai
 The former Indian captain said, "when we won the series in 2007, Zaheer bowled brilliantly, but he also got support from other bowlers
 anil bejod tha kyonki usne ek chor se ran nahin banane die or match ko niyantran main rakhane main safal rahaa
 ' bhartiya team main anbhavi tej gendbaaj ishanth sharma shaamil hai jo team main ekmaatr aise gendbaaj hai jinhen is daur se pehle england main test match khilne kaa anubhav hasil he
 However, this fast bowler did not appear to be in rhythm in practice matches
 unke alaava team main bhubaneshwar kumaar, mohammad sami or stuart binni jaise tej gendbaaj shaamil hai
 Dravid said that if the Indian bowlers were not successful in swinging the ball, then it would be difficult to disturb the England batsmen
 unhone kaha, 'us (2007) shrunkhlaa main teenon tej gendbaaj gend ko swing karaane main safal rahe the or agar bhartiya gend ko upar pich karte hai or swing karaate hai to mujhe lagata he ki unke paas mauka rahegaa
 ' dravid ne haalanki bharosa jataayaa ki cheteshwar pujaara, shikhar dhawan or rohit sharma jaise yuva ballebaaj prabhavi pradarshan kar paaenge
 He said, 'I think most of them will do well
 unhone yahaan bhale hi test match nahin khelaa ho, lekin vah yahaan e team ke saath aa chuke hai or unhone yahaan van-de cricket khelaa he jisamen pichley saal hui champions trophy (jise bharat ne jeeta) bhi shaamil he
