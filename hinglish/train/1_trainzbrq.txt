 khaadi apni pahchaan khota ja rahaa he or uski pahchaan ko banaae rakhane ke liye jaruri he ki khaadi ko yuvaaon tak pahunchaaya jaae or popular banaaya jaae
 Fashionable Khadi shoes have been made for the first time in the country
 Khadi shoes are hand stitched and cut

 lekin ab khaadi ko ek nai pahchaan dene ke liye unhone khaadi ke juute, laptop bag, purse or belt jaisi chijen banane kii koshish kii he
 All these things will attract youth to wear Khadi

 On July 1, we set out from the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi on the journey of the holy Amarnath Yatra, Delhi became smaller from the sky and then we reached Srinagar while doing strenuous movements from the clouds
 airport ke baahar kadi suraksha thi
 This time a special type of radio frequency identification, called RFID tag, was being installed in the vehicles of passengers going to the holy Amarnath
 hamaari taxi main bhi yah tag laga diya gaya, jisase pataa chale ki yah vaahan amarnath yatra kaa he, or jagah jagah lage baar code reader se car kii lokation bhi milti rahe

 Stay here and watch yourself
 ' iske baad ham kashmir frontir biguef camp pahunche
 After traveling about 950 km from Delhi, we reached the BSF camp in Srinagar
 amarnath yatra par jane se pehle vahaan registration or medical jaanch jaruri hoti he
 This time online registration has also been started for the Amarnath Yatra
 isamen ab tak kareeb do lakh log registration karvaa chuke hai
 We got our medical examination and registration done at BASF Camp
 yatriyon ko ek baar code bhi miltaa he jiske jariye unki gatividhiyon kii jaankaree milti he
 After registration and medical treatment, we set out on the same journey on the same day
 pavitra amarnath kii gupha tak pahunchane ke do raste hai
 The first is about 106 km from Srinagar to the holy Amarnath cave via Sonamarg, Baltal, Bari
 doosraa jammu se pahalgam hote hue, chandanwari, pissu top, sheshnag, panchtarini hote hue amarnath gupha tak kareeb 325 kimi kaa lanbaa safar
 Special radio frequency identification (RFID) tags are being installed on the vehicles of passengers going to Amarnath
 ham srinagar se sonmarg ke raste par aage bade jisaki duuri kareeb 80 kilometre he
 On both sides of the road, the security personnel were seen
 har 100 meter par ek jawan, bakhtarband gaadiyaan or chal daste the
 The message is clear that this time there should be no terrorist attack on the pilgrimage
 srinagar se sonmarg ke raste par mausam saaf hone se raste main koi pareshaani nahin hui
 Taxi driver Imran said that 'it is six months of summer and six months of winter
 abhi garmi kaa mausam chal rahaa he, lekin upar vaale kii meharbaani se abhi bhi sardi he
 The path we are going on does not cause much trouble even when the weather is bad
 aap ye samajho ki bombai kaa fishan or kashmir kaa mausam semhai, pataa nahin kab badal jaae
 'on this road along the river Sindh, snow-capped mountains, greenery and beautiful instruments make you feel closer to Baba Barfani

 We reached Sonamarg through this path made by cutting mountains
 raat vahiin kaati or phir aage kaa safar shuru kiya
 The temperature at 5:30 in the morning was 6 degrees Celsius
 mausam bilkul saaf tha
 Behind you you will see beautiful mountains and instruments
 yahaan se ham kareeb 15 minute kaa rasta taykar nilgrant heliped gaye
 Security was very tight on the Nilgrant Helipade
 kadi jaanch ke baad ham helicopter ke jariye panchatarani panhuche
 On reaching there, there was a feeling of severe cold and lack of oxygen
 vahaan tirthayatriyon ke rukne ke liye kai camp lage hai
 After stopping for a while at the CRPF camp there, we decided to go ahead
 hamen bataaya gaya ki ek din pehle yahaan acchhee barish hui he or is baar glacier zyada hone se raste par barf he, mitti geeli he, lihaaja phislan bahut zyada he isliye khachchar se janaa surakshit rahegaa
 The journey ahead began
 hajaaron kii sankhya menkhcchar, palki vaale yahaan graahakon kii talash main khadey the
 This holy journey is also a source of livelihood for Kashmiri Muslims
 unke bina yah yatra puri nahin ho paati
 The distance of Baba Bholenath's cave is 6 kilometers from here
 ham panchatarani pahunch gaye
 Panchatarni is a river consisting of 5 rivers
 yah bhi kahawat he ki bholebaba yahaan se paanch tatwon ko lekar gaye the, isliye ise panchatarani kehete hai
 Our journey started from here onwards
 ham khachchar par baithkar chale, kyonki vahanmitti bahut geeli thi
 The path made by snow-capped mountains and snow-cut in the Himalayan region of southern Kashmir is extremely inaccessible
 hajaaron feet neeche bah rahi panchatarani nadi ke saath-saath bane is raste kii chadhaai sabase kathin he
 Many times, if there are more passengers on this thin road, then traffic jams also occur
 khachchar vaale jaahid se jab poocha ki khachchar par baithne main kya saavdhaaniyaan baratani padati hai? jawaab main unhone bataaya 'sar aapako donon taraf kaa balance baraabar rakhana he or najar dur rakhana he
 Hair and their heads, and as you climb, when the bend comes down, the weight has to be backward
 ' ghode ke trend hone ke bare main poocha ta unhone kaha - 'haa sar inako ham 2 maheene training dete hai
 Even if it is a cold winter, there is snow, the road is inaccessible
 'raste main aapako har jagah suraksha kaa jimmaa sambhaal rahe hamaare jaanbaaj jawan najar aaenge
 This time 40 thousand soldiers are engaged in protecting the pilgrims
 khatra kharaab mausam se hi nahin balki aatankiyon se bhi he
 Security agencies are tracking the entire route through satellite trackers
 agar raste main kisi ko saans lene main pareshaani hoti he to itibipi ke jawan kuch jagahon par oxigen silendar liye milenge
 The next place is called Sangam where both the paths coming from Pahalgam and Baltal meet
 yahaan se aage badhate hi holi kev dikhne lagati he, jise amarnath ghati kahati hai
 There is snow here

 Baba Barfani is just some distance away from here

 yahaan oxizan behad kam hone se saans lene main dikkat ho rahi thi
 This time the snow is much higher than before
 suraksha ke saath siarpief ke jawan pyaase tirthayatriyon ko pani pilaakar unki seva kar rahe the
 Climbing up to 300 straight stairs, it is only right to stop here due to lack of oxygen
 yahaan kai logon kii tabiyat kharaab ho jaati he
 There is a medical camp for treatment
 medical camp ke doctor manameet ne bataaya ki 'yahaan oxigen kii kaaphi kami he
 Most of his patients come
 hamaare paas oxigen ke silendar hai or yahaan kaa mausam kabhi barish kabhi dhoop kaa he
 If the patients of hypothermia come more in the rain, then we have also made complete preparations for that
 ' baba barphani ke darshan ke liye desh ke kone-kone se aane vaale lakhon shraddhalu har jokhim mol lete hai
 After a long and inaccessible journey, we finally saw Baba Barfani in a cave 20 feet wide and 20 feet long
 is baar shivlinga kaa aakaar pehle se zyada bada he
 Rajendra Shastri, the chief priest of the Amarnath cave told that 'people come here
 yah adbhut sthaan he
 The penis of God is formed here in a natural way

 It is also believed that Bhole Baba narrated the immortal story to Parvati here
 usee se logon kii aasthaa judi hui heki ham bhi yahaan aakar apane jivan ko safal banaaen
 'when asked if Shivling is big this time? In response, he said that 'see after last 11 years, such a big Shivling has been built
 ummid he ki dedh maheene yaa do maheene kii yatra tak yah rahegaa
 'the snow-covered Sheshnag hill is seen in front of Baba Barfani's cave
 pichley saal kareeb paune teen lakh log baba barphani ke darshan karne aae is baar or zyada shraddhaluon ke aane kii ummid he
 a faithful Ashok Kasana said that 'I have come for the fourth time
 pichhali baar mausam bahut kharaab tha
 The weather was very good this time

 'one lady devotee said that' i have come from Nanded felt very good
 chadhane main koi pareshaani nahin hui
 Devotee Mehul said- 'I have come for the first time, had a great experience
 thodi takalif to hoti he, rasta bahut kharaab he
 'the biggest challenge is handling the crowd and thwarting any kind of terrorist threat
 yahaan kii suraksha kaa jimmaa siarpief ke paas he
 CCTV cameras are installed all around and a control room is also built
 drone camaron ke jariye nigaraanee kii ja rahi he or oonchai par bhartiya sena tainaat he
 Commandant of 164 battalion of CRPF, Prahlad Paswan said that 'very good security arrangements have been made this time

 Baba Bholenath's faith is so long that people from all over the world are drawn

 typography unhen pasand thi
 And it looks too
 apple jo kuch karti he usamen behtareen typography kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 And like all great artists, his greatness was not only in imagining, but he applied it with great ruthlessness without any compromise and carried out the smallest detail very cleanly
 ham digital duniya ke saath jis tarah se kaam karte hai or uskaa istemaal karte hai, use dekhne or usamen khubsuurati paidaa karne kii unki kshamta unhen apane asaadhaaran saathiyon ke bich ek alag darje main rakhti he

 usamen saare niyamon or reeti-rivaajon ko taak par dhar diya gaya tha
 Thus his experience and identity with a new social context merged with his natural artistic talent and innate intelligence and he was convinced that he could make the world a better place
 mujhe lagata he ki aupchaarik shiksha ke abhaav ne unke paksh main kaam kiya kyonki unhone apni sahaj buddhi se chizon ko samajhna sikh liya

 Its concern is to attract consumers with sensitivity, to stay with them with beautiful design and simplicity, the joy and fun of constantly discovering new things that they can and the amazing display of its products
 agar aisa nahin tha to log kai dinon tak iphone ke liye qatari main kyon khadey rahete the yaa steve kii yaad main fouran itane kaside kyon kaadhe gaye yaa unki maut ke baad sandeshon se net kyon jam ho gaya
 Steve leads people into a future he is fascinated with
 logon ne iskaa sila bepanaah vafadari se diya
 Simplicity made Apple bigger
 steve kaa maananaa tha ki apple kaa uddeshy apni shrenee main sarvshereshth utpaada taiyaar karnaa he, chaahe vah computer ho, laptop, empi3 player ho yaa tablet
 Then sell it
 bas itnaa hi uddeshy tha is company kaa
 Nobody worries about the money other than the head of finance at Apple

 And only one person makes the final decision
 yaa karata tha
 Steve Jobs
 apple jaisi 100 arab dollar kii company innovations kaise barkaraar rakhti he or ek ke baad ek hit utpaada kaise utaarti rahati he? dhyaan
 Apple still considers itself a new company and behaves as if it has a shortage of resources
 apple main 'na' kahana 'haa' kehane jitna hi mahatvapurn he
 Significantly, the number of products is less than the size of Apple

 italy ne england par romaanchak jeet hasil kii
 Italy defeated England 2–1 to win
 is match ko bhi netherlands-spain jaise mukaable kii tarah dekha ja rahaa tha
 All football lovers had their eyes on this too
 khel ke pehle aadhe ghante main donon timen shunya par thim
 Italian player Marschio scored the first goal in the 35th minute to take a 1-0 lead
 isi ke thik do minute baad england ke khilaadi sturrij ne 37wein minute main apni team ke liye gol dagkar score 1-1 kar diya
 After half time, Italian player Balotelli scored the second goal in the 50th minute to bring the team closer to victory
 kaala dhanek baar phir surkhiyon main he
 After the Supreme Court rebuke, the government has sent a sealed envelope to him which has been handed over to the court by the Special Investigation Committee
 is suchi ke bare main samiti ke pramukh justise embi shah kaa kahana he ki isamen kuch bhi nayaa nahin he
 These are the same names that came to the committee earlier
 yani ki itane shor-sharabe ke baad kuch bhi khaas haath nahin aayaa
 Even before this, the government had given some names which are not surprising to see as they are all businessmen and those whose work is also abroad
 us suchi se sarkaar kii saakh ko dhakka pahunchaa kyonki logon ko ummid thi ki aise naam saamne aaenge jinhen dekhakar log hairaan ho jaaenge
 More hope was that the names of many politicians would also come because Arun Jaitley also pointed to that
 lekin aisa kuch hota nazar nahin aa rahaa he
 This is very surprising and disappointing because BJP always raised the issue of hidden black money abroad and put it on the national table
 ab jabaki vah satta main he to uskaa ferj he ki vah videshon main chupe arabon dollar kaa kaala dhan bharat main laane kaa prayaas kare
 The party will not only have to do this, but one has to give a strong message through this that there is no good for those who take the money abroad
 agar party deshbhakti kaa dambh bharti he to use kuch vyaavhaarik kadam uthaane hi honge
 Just being a stereotypes will do nothing
 lekin party ko pehle is baat kaa intazaam karnaa hoga ki kaala dhan bane hi nahin
 That is, he has to eliminate the causes that cause black money
 iske liye tex pranali main bhi kai sudhaar karne honge
 One of the reasons for black money is tax evasion in the purchase of houses
 iskaa kaaran he ki rajya sarkaron ne stamp duty itani zyada rakhi hui he ki log makaan ke puure mulya kaa ek hissaa hi bataate hai
 Due to this, white money becomes black on a large scale
 bhrasht rajaneta kaam karwaane ke evaj main bada kamishan lete hai or vah sara dhan yahaan se videsh chalaa jaataa he
 Many industrialists and businessmen do not declare their income right and their money gets deposited abroad in the form of black money
 darasal bharat se videshon main paisa bhejnaa yaa vahaan se mangana aaj bhi bahut aasaan he or iske liye hawala kaarobaari baithe hue hai
 It is to be seen now when and how strongly the BJP is able to implement this part of the election manifesto
 is par uski pratishtha nirbhar karti he or desh kii arthvyavastha kaa vikaas bhi
 At present, the government does not see any magic wand that can be used to detect black money and come out
 bijepi ko yah samajhnaa hoga ki janata ke sabar kii bhi seemaa hoti he or uskaa imtihaan lenaa koi sahi vichaar nahin hoga
 Amid the uproar by opposition members, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Vijay Goel criticized the Congress for calling the Modi government anti-dalit
 sadasyon ke vyavhaar par apni naaraazgi jaahir karte hue naidu ne kaha, "kai vidheyak lambit hai
 People want development and law
 virodh se koi phayda nahin ho hone vaala
 i am willing to allow you to discuss every issue
 yah durbhagyapurna he ki asana charchaa kii anumati de rahaa he, lekin sadsy iske liye taiyaar nahin he
 You are taking the test of people's patience
 puraa desh aapako dekh rahaa he
 You are killing democracy
 " As the ruckus continued, Naidu adjourned the Rajya Sabha proceedings till 2 pm
 hangaamaa jari rahane ke kaan naidu ne rajyasabha kii kaarywahi dohapar do baje tak ke liye sthagit kar di

 The results of the by-elections in 10 assembly seats in eight states of the country came on Thursday
 inamen se jis ek seat ke nateezon par puure desh kii nigaah thi wo thi dilli kii rajouri garden seat
 This seat was vacant after the resignation of AAP MLA Jarnail Singh
 guuruuvaar ko is seat par jahaan bijepi-akali gathbandhan ke ummidavaar manjinder singh sirsa ne 14 hajaar 652 maton se jeet darj kii, vahiin aam aadmi party ke ummidavaar kii jamaanat tak nahin batch pai
 For the Arvind Kejriwal government of Delhi and his Aam Aadmi Party, this is not just a matter of losing one seat, but this one defeat has created many challenges for the party and the government
 1-mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii sthiti is haar sekamjor hogi kyonki unka ab wo karishmanhin rahaa he jo dilli vidhansabha chunaav main tha, yani brands kejariwal ko jhatka laga he
 On the decisions of Arvind, there has been a loud voice in the party till now, but now these voices can be vocal

 After the defeat, Kumar tweeted - Water can be brought to the eye / still the burning city can be saved
 2-emsidi ke chunaav agle hafte hone hai or usase pehle aam aadmi party kii sthiti kaa andaja upachunaav ke nattejey se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 If there are such results, then the plan to occupy the MCD may fail
 congress ne jis tarah se vot batore hai wo dilli main uske punaroddhar ke sanket de rahe hai or ye aam aadmi party ke liye mushkil badhaane vaala he
 The 3-party is preparing for the Gujarat elections but the defeat in the by-election shows that its Delhi land is slipping because the party has not just lost but has lost badly
 uskaa vot pratishat bahut hi zyada gira he or wo apni jamaanat tak nahin bachaa pai he
 These results are worrisome for the party, considering a mere two-year period
 4-vidhansabha main ab tak bijepi ke teen vidhayak hikejariwal ke liye mushkilenkhadi karte rahe hai lekin ab inaki sankhya badhkar 4 ho gai he
 The sword of action is hanging from the Election Commission on 21 AAP mlas
 agar ve ayogy sabit hue or upachunaav main aap iff siton par apana pradarshan barkaraar nahin rakh pai to party kaa bhavishya hi sawaalon main aa jayega
 5 - Not only Kejriwal but the functioning of Delhi government will also be questioned
 chunaav nateezon se saaf he ki sarkaar vipaksh ke apane khilaaf prachaar kaa jawaab dene main naakaam rahi he or uski chhavi janata ke bich kharaab ho rahi he
 The Kejriwal government may make many claims to work for the good of the public, but the public is not looking forward to it

 loksabhaa chunaav nateezon kaa countdown shuru ho chukaa he
 Only two days are left for the results of the country's largest election
 lekin nateezon se pehle agsit pole ne raajnneetik bhuuchaal laa diya he or narendra modi ko ek baar phir satta ke shikhar tak pahunchane kaa anumaan jataayaa he
 Not only this, Modi Bharatiya Janata Party colleagues are also seeing good days in the tsunami
 aise hi ek sahyogi bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar hai
 Nitish Kumar's party Janata Dal United (JDU) does politics in Bihar and contested the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 on its own
 is chunaav main jediu kaa pradarshan bahut niraashajanak rahaa tha
 Despite being the Chief Minister of the state, Nitish Kumar managed to win his party 2 seats with just 16% vote share
 ek dashak main jediu kaa yah sabase kharaab rigelt tha
 Earlier in 2009, JDU emerged as the largest party in Bihar and won 20 Lok Sabha seats (24% votes) alone out of total 40
 jabaki bijepi 12, argedy 4 or congress 2 siten hi jeet pai thi
 That is, despite the Congress government at the center in this election, the magic of good governance Babu Nitish continued in Bihar
 haalanki, nitish kumaar kii ye hawa jab tab vah bijepi ke saath endie main savaar the
 The two parties contested the coalition in Bihar and won unilaterally
 nitish kumaar ke raajnneetik itihaas par najar daalen to bijepi ke sahyog se unhen ahm jimmedaariyaan sanbhaalane kaa mauka mila
 Nitish is considered a master of coalition politics
 1996 main khuletaur par bijepi ke samarthan main utre nitish kumaar centre main atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar kaa hissaa rahe
 After this, in 2005 he became the Chief Minister of Bihar only with the cooperation of BJP and his journey continues till now
 haalanki, is raste main nitish ne ek baar bijepi kaa saath bhi choda
 In 2013, Nitish Kumar surprised everyone by deciding to separate from NDA
 mana gaya ki bijepi kii taraf se narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiye jane ke chalate unhone yah faisla liya
 Meanwhile, Nitish's attitude also became tough towards the BJP and he formed a new alliance with Lalu Prasad Yadav in the Bihar Assembly elections of 2015 and became the Chief Minister again

 dagsa naam ke is shaks kii maukey par hi maut ho gai
 This incident of murder occurred on New Year's Eve
 madhyapradesh mencongresssoft hindutv kii niti ko apana rahi he
 This is the reason that Congress these days has started talking about cow, Narmada, temple and now Ram in the state
 isi ke chalate congress ne 'ram van gaman path yatra' mangalvaar ko chitrakoot se aarambh kii
 Initially there was confusion about this journey that due to Pitrupaksha the yatra may be postponed
 lekin aisa nahin hua
 Now the yatra will pass for 15 days through 35 assembly constituencies

 Union Minister VK Singhsham had reached the Pakistan High Commission at seven and a half hours - and left 10 minutes later
 10 baje unhone pehla twit kiya - uske baad chaar twit or kiye, jinamein unhone'duty' or 'asantosh'kii baat kii
 # DUTYA task or action that a person is bound to perform for moral or legal reasons — Vijay Kumar Singh (@gen_vksingh) March 23, 2015 # dutythe force that binds one morally or legally to one's obligations— Vijay Kumar Singh (@gen_vksingh) March 23, 2015 In the advice and warning day to Pakistan, Prime Minister Modi tweeted and conveyed congratulations to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Pakistan's National Day and in another tweet, the advice is, 'my honor is that india-pakistan should solve all the problems from talks needed
 lekin baatcheet aise maahaul main hona chahie jahaan hinsa or aatank na ho
 Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin also said, "we are ready to resolve all matters through peaceful negotiations in the form of bilateral relations with Pakistan
" is dauraan tisare paksh kii bhoomika pehle bhi kabhi nahin rahi or aage bhi nahin hogi
 Singh was also part of this strategy of politics and diplomacy
 is baar sarkaar ne hurriyat netaaon kii shirkat par koi etraj nahin jataayaa
 Simultaneously, Singh was sent as Minister of State for External Affairs in the program of Pak High Commission
 nyotaa videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko bhi tha, lekin wo isse dur rahi
 Assuming his 'duty', Singh also reached the program
 paak ucchayukta abdul basit ke saath photo bhi khinchvaae, taaki sanad rahe, lekin usase zyada vahaan ruknaa unke liye munasib nahin laga or wo khisak liye
 VK Singh's presence in that program on duty, disguise and diplomacy was shocking to many
 pichley saal jin hurriyat netaaon se paak ucchayukta ke mulaakaat ke chalate bharat ne pakistan se baatcheet band kar di thi, unheen kii maujuudagi main singh kaarykram main shaamil ko shaamil hona padaa
 Leadership in a military is codified, but political and diplomatic cleverness may be reduced
 faujee krodh main chehre par muskuraahat laane main yakeen nahin rakhata, netaa or rajanyik ke liye ke liye to ye rosemara kii jindagi kaa hissaa he
 Perhaps that is why Singh must have had trouble molding himself into the political mold
 jab modi mantrimandal kaa gathan hua to singh ko rajya mantri banaaya gaya
 Naturally, as discussed, Singh was to go to the Ministry of Defense
 kuch hi maheene pehle army chif ke pad se ritair hue singh ko videsh mantralay main rajya mantri banaaya gaya
 It was a political decision
 singh or kar bhi kya sakate the
 After becoming a minister, he made a loud noise in a military-related matter, but the government not only ignored him but also overpowered him
 singh chup rahe
 But when it comes to Pakistan, and those who support its stand, it becomes difficult to remain silent
 singh ke taaja twit to yahi sanket de rahe hai
 However, he took the media on target
 # disgustto offend the moral sense, principles, or taste of— Vijay Kumar Singh (@gen_vksingh)march 23, 2015 # 'disgust'ed to see how certain sections of the media are twisting this issue— Vijay Kumar Singh (@gen_vksingh)march 23, 2015aasaan nahin hoti siyasat kii seedhifaujee sirf uniform pahanane se nahin, puure dilo-dimag se hota he
 Similarly, a leader is not just about clothes
 vakt kii pabandi ke chalate bhale hi faujee ko uniform taang deni pade or naye libaas dhaaran kerani pade - uski apni shakhsiyat takreeban beasar rahati he
 VK Singh's green jacket [which, incidentally or deliberately worn], could neither change the perception of Pakistan or Pakistan-based Hurriyat leaders nor teach them how to mold themselves under the principles of diplomacy
 raajnneeti main aane vaale wo pehle faujee to nahin hai, lekin hakeekat to yahi he ki faujee ke netaa banane main vakt to lagata he
 BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani has accused the Indian government that the government has failed to overcome corruption and neither has the government ratified the United Nations Comprehensive Treaty against Corruption
 adwani ne apane blog par likhaa he, ‘sansad kaa maujuuda satr bhrashtachar ke mudde par kendrit he
 Many people may not know that in 2004, the United Nations Office of Substance and Crime issued a comprehensive treaty against corruption
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf is sandhi ke anuchhed 67 ke mutabik sanyukt raashtra ke sabhi sadsy deshon ko is par disambar, 2005 tak hastakshar karne the
 According to Advani, 'every year a group of mps from our country go there to participate in the UN proceedings
 is saal bhaajapa ke ek saansad shanta kumaar bhi vahaan gaye the
 Kumar told the meeting of the BJP Parliamentary Party that 140 countries have signed the treaty so far and 14 have not ratified it yet and i feel sad to say that India is also among those 14 is
 ’adwani ne likhaa he ki swiss bank association ke mutabik union bank of switzraland main kaala dhan jamaa karaane waalon main bharatiyon kii sankhya sabase zyada he
 According to Advani, 'BJP has been campaigning against this black money for a long time
 is saal hamane is maamle par shodh karne ke liye chaar sadasyeey kaarybal banaaya
 The BJP leader wrote, "during the Lok Sabha elections, the Prime Minister promised that in the first 100 days of his tenure, he will take concrete action in the matter of black money deposited in foreign banks
" sarkaar bane hue 500 se bhi zyada din ho gaye hai, lekin ab tak is disha main koi pragati nahin hui he
 The only reason for this is lack of political will
 ’adwani ne kaha he, ‘is baat main bhi koi aashcharya nahin he ki ab tak yuan kanvation against karpshan kaa anumodan bhi nahin kiya gaya he
 The Parliament has not been in operation for more than two weeks, but the government is not ready to accept the demand of the entire opposition that a probe by the JPC be conducted in the case of the recently revealed scams
 ’adwani ne desh kii ore se aashaa vyakt karte hue kaha he ki bharat sarkaar ‘yuan kanvation against karpshan kaa anumodan kare, haal hi main saamne aae ghotaalon kii jepisi jaanch karaae, doshiyon ko sajaa de or ant main dow
 During the election campaign by Manmohan Singh, fulfill this promise that our country's black money deposited in foreign banks will be brought back to the country
 ’ There has always been a craze among cricket fans regarding Team India's dressing room, but very few things can come out there
 cricket match ke dauraan aakraamak or gambhir dikhne vaale khilaadi dressing room main jamkar masti karte hai or saathi khilaadiyon ke saath prank bhi khelte hai

 ' lekin yuvi isko lekar itnaa tension main aa gaye ki neend kii goli khaakar so gaye
 The next morning at breakfast, Dada told Yuvi that he was joking
 ab ye majaak dada ke liye to yaheen khatm ho gaya, lekin yuvi ne is prank kaa badla paanch saal baad liya
 Yuvi changed something like this
 
 
 2005 main pakistan kaa bharat daura tha
 When the grandfather reached the dressing room for the team meeting before the match between the two teams in Kochi, all the players were already there
 team meeting ke baad yuvaraj singh, virendra sahvaag or harbhajan singh ne news paper kii ek kating team manager or dada ko thamai
 An interview of Sourav Ganguly was printed on this paper, in which Dada was fiercely critical of fellow players
 dada har khilaadi ke paas gaye or kaha ki ye intervyuu unhone nahin diya he
 Dada then said that he would resign from his captaincy and his eyes were going to spill as soon as he said this
 lekin rahul dravid ne is prank kaa khulaasa kar diya
 After this, Dada took the bat and ran to the fellow players
 ye prank yuvi ne april main kiya tha
 Yuvi himself revealed this prank during a talk show
 dekhen puraa videoh Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday advised BJP leaders to refrain from making irresponsible statements
 piem modi ne kaha ki aise bayanon se party kii chhavi kharaab hoti he
 During the interaction with party mps, mlas and other representatives, PM Modi said that many times leaders make statements in front of the media and they are provided in a 'spicy' way and then to hold them (media) responsible for the dispute
 Does not make any sense piem modi kaha, ‘media ko jimmedaar nahin teharie, vah apana kaam kar rahaa he
 We should not fall into everything and do not stand in front of the TV and show the country the way on every issue, people who have been given the responsibility to speak on issues will speak
 ’media ko na den doshanarendra modi ne kaha, ‘kai baar hamaare kaaryakarta kehete hai ki media yah kar rahaa he, media vah kar rahaa he, lekin kya hamane sochaa he ki ham apni galatiyon se media ko ‘masala’ de rahe hai? jaise ki ham samaaj vigyaani yaa vidwaan hon jo har samasya kaa vishleshan kar sakate hai
 'he said,' When we see the cameraman, he starts making statements, the media uses the part which he considers use
 yah uski galati nahin he, hamen khud ko rokna hoga

 'sangakaara test cricket bhi chhodana chaahate hai! kya bakawaas he! itnaa ahm faisalaa unpar nahin choda ja saktaa! This tweet is from famous commentator Harsha Bhogle

 khabbu ballebaaz or wicketiper
 This player is constantly defying all the criteria for how long a player's career is
 37 saal kii umr main rukne kaa naam nahin le rahaa
 Age has no effect on fitness nor on form
 form itnaa jabardast he ki australia or newzealand main chal rahe isisi world cap main lagaataar 4 shatak thok die hai
 105 against Bangladesh, 117 against England, 104 against Australia and 124 against Scotland
 world cap to kya ab tak khele gaye 3632 vanade maichon main bhi aisa karnama koi nahin kar paaya he
 Sachin Tendulkar tweeted, '4 consecutive centuries! Great batting and awesome form
 ' In the same World Cup, he also touched the figure of 14 thousand runs against Australia
 vanade main ab sirf sachin tendulkar 18,246 ranon ke saath unase aage hai
 He is at number five in the most runs scored in Tests
 unase aage sachin tendulkar, riki ponting, zake kallis or rahul dravid hai
 He averaged 58 in Tests
 66 he
 No player has had a better average in the last 47 years
 ye hi nahin aapako ye jaanakar shaayad hairaani ho ki test main 5000 se zyaada ran banane waalon ballebaazon main unka ausat sirf do hi khilaadiyon se kam he-sar don breadman or ken bairington
 Kumar Sangakkara is about to say goodbye to ODI after the World Cup
 agast main ve bharat ke saath 3 teston kii series ke baad test se bhi ritair ho jaaenge
 Should this batsman be retired like this? Perhaps Sangakkara is from that rare and endangered species who believes that the real champion is the one who calls the game at the top
 ye hairaan karata he ki kariyar ke aakhri saalon main sangakaara duniya ke sabase kaamyaab ballebaaz ban kar ubhare hai
 The figures confirm this
 agar cricket ke teenon formatt ko mila den to pichley 5 saal main sangakara ne vishwa main sabase zyaada ran banaae hai
 He has scored 14211 runs in 269 matches in these five years
 isamen 35 shatak or 85 ardhashatak shaamil hai
 Tillakaratne Dilshan is nearly 4 thousand runs behind him at number two
 abi divilliars tisare, hashim aamala chauthe, mahela jayavardhane paanchave or bharat ke viraat kohli chathe number par hai
 In the last 3 years, their average has increased instead of decreasing
 2013 main unka test ausat 91

 00 has been reached
 vanade main bhi yahi kahani he
 He averaged 63 in 2013
 91, pichley saal 46
 51 and 90 this year
 77 ho gaya he
 It was only 15 years ago that a 22-year-old law student stepped into international cricket that it was only then that cricket experts said that this gentle and calm man is going to write a new story of success
 ve galat nahin the
 In 2006, with Mahela Jayawardene, he shared a 624-run partnership against South Africa at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground in Colombo
 wo bhi del sten or makhaya antini jaise gendbaazon ke saamne
 Sangakkara played a memorable innings of 287 runs
 ek saal baad hobart main 192 ranon kii unki pari bhi jabardast rahi
 Kumar Sangakkara wrote many new works from his performance
 ek wicketiper ke liye number 3 par ballebaazi karnaa behad mushkil mana jaataa he
 But Sangakkara has also made it easy
 aksar daaen haath ke ballebaaz ke cat or pul ko sughad or darshneey mana jaataa he lekin baayen haath ke sangakaara ne is myth ko bhi tod diya
 It is his ability that every franchise in the IPL wants him to be in his team
 zaahir he ye khilaadi jitani shoharat kaa hakdaar rahaa he wo use nahin mili
 After Sangakkara's retirement in August, these questions will remain incomplete - if Kumar Sangakkara had not retired, how many more records would have been broken

 The Antony Committee to investigate the reasons for the 2014 defeat had blamed the pro-muslim image of the Congress party
 aise main bhavishya ke lihaaj se muslim voton ke maddenjar congress ab phoonk-foonkkar kadam uthaa rahi he
 In fact, the Congress feels that in today's era a new strategy has to be devised to deal with the politics of hindu-muslim
 isiilie rahul gandhi ne muslim buddhijiviyon or vichaarkon ke saath sangoshtee bulaai hai
 After many meetings with tribals, Dalits and backward classes, Rahul Gandhi is now eyeing the big Muslim vote bank
 isse bhi badi baat yah he ki unke saamne chunaav main hindu-muslim voton ke dhruvikaran ko rokane kii bhi badi chunauti he
 Therefore, Rahul Gandhi has chosen faces who are not considered fundamentalists but liberals and scholars to join the Muslims
 rahul gandhi is baithak ke zarie muslim samaaj main apni sweekaaryata badhanaa chaahate hai
 At the same time, we will also discuss with these Muslim intellectuals about how to prevent polarization in the electoral environment? Rahul will also include the opinions received from these people in his party's election manifesto

 'modi has taken a pinch of times about Rahul Gandhi, but Modi had never done so much direct comment on Kejriwal before

 He told the gathering, 'if the Jan Lokpal Bill to eradicate corruption from the country is passed, then we have no opposition from the Congress
 yadi aisa ho jaae to ham congress ke khilaaf vot dene ke liye kisi se nahin kahenge
 'read: Digvijay Singh said,' Anna is being misled '', he clarified that Team Anna is not asking anyone to vote for a particular party
 kejariwal ne kaha, ‘agar team anna ke abhiyaan ke baad bhi koi bhrasht netaa chunakar sansad main jaataa he to jan lokapal vidheyak uske khilaaf uchit karrwai sunishchit karegaa
 Former police officers Kiran Bedi and Manish Sisodia also participated in Team Anna's campaign against Congress in Hisar Lok Sabha by-election

 One user wrote that Virat should concentrate on cricket in Capetown and not on lunch with Anushka
 vahiin ek retweet main likhaa gaya he, mahatma gandhi ko bhi south africa main sangharsh karnaa padaa tha, viraat kohli ko bhi karnaa padegaa

 More than three years after the indo-pak cricketing relationship broke down due to the Mumbai terror attack, the Indian Cricket Board has said that it has no objection to any Pakistan team participating in the Champions League Twenty20 tournament

 Srinivasan said, the BCCI will make this recommendation to the Governing Council
 champions lig tii-20 par bisisiai, cricket australia or cricket dakshin africa kaa malikana haq he
 We will recommend to the Governing Council that the BCCI has no objection and is willing to invite the team from Pakistan to the Champions League

 As far as inviting the Pakistan team is concerned, it will be done by the Governing Council
 bisisiai sanchaalan parishad ko sifarish karegaa, jo is maamle main faisla karegi
 The BCCI hopes to receive appreciation from the neighboring country for its move, as the Pakistan Cricket Board is attempting to involve its team in the tournament from the first Champions League tournament in 2009
 tippaniyan Asked if the decision was a change in attitude towards Pakistan, Srinivasan said, the issue will be taken up by the Governing Council of the Champions League
 isliye is saal toornament ke sangyojan or tiimon kii sankhya ke alaava is par bhi charchaa hogi ki kise aamantrit kiya jaae

 ’’ Union minister and BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad has said that Rahul Gandhi raises a lot of questions but only held a 70-second press conference

 We consider it a national challenge
 ham kisi bhi rup main aatankwaad ko sweekaar nahin karte hai
 Anand Sharma had said that there is a request from the Prime Minister and also the question that all opposition parties including Congress have the right to ask questions

 As an MP, he worked with the Estimates Committee of the Lok Sabha
 1984 se 1989 tak saansad rahane ke dauraan vah united neshans kamishan on states of vimen main bharat kii pratinidhi raheen
 Expressing confidence in him, Sheila Dixit was made Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs and then Minister of State in PMO in Rajiv Gandhi Cabinet
 bataa den ki shila dikshit ke sasur umashankar dikshit indira gandhi kii sarkaar main cabinet mantri the

 Sheila Dixit wrote, 'one day my father-in-law Umashankar Dixit called Indira Gandhi for dinner and after the meal i served him vanilla ice cream with hot jalebis
 shila dikshit ne likhaa, 'meraa yah prayog indira gandhi ko bahut pansad aayaa
