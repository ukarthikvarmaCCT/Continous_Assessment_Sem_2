 loksabhaa chunaav kii gahamagahami ke bich nitish kumaar ne narendra modi or bijepi par jamkar hamalaa bolaa he
 Bihar CM Nitish has resorted to social media to target Modi
 fasebuk par apane post main nitish ne kaha he ki bijepi ne pehle ram ko thaga ab mahadev kii baari he
 That is, Modi's candidature from Varanasi seat is now knocking Nitish too
 nitish ne modi kii party kii bijepi ko to 'bhasmasur' qaraar diya he
 Nitish has written on Facebook, 'BJP is building a trap of prapancha in Bihar
 jo bihar anek dharmon ke mul kii kadi he, vahaan raajnneetik propaganda pahunchane ke liye bijepi har-har mahadev ke jap kaa apmaan kar rahi he
 Their main leaders are on the top saying that they will not raise such slogans, but are distributing leaflets all over Bihar
 bhasmasur ne bhi jab tapasya kii hogi to har har mahadev ke jap kaa apmaan nahin kiya hoga
 But the BJP has gone two steps ahead of Bhasmasura
 bhagwaan ram ko thagne main to koi kasar chodi nahin thi, ab bhagwaan shiv ke peeche bhi lag gaye hai
 What will the humans survive when God is not saved? ”taking a dig at Modi and BJP, the CM further writes,“ They make hawa that they will give to Bihar, they condition that the Chief Minister will have to apologize and despite this, all over Bihar Pamphlets distribute 'modi will give special support and special packages'
 ham bihari vishesh rajya kaa darja lenge– hamaara haq he
 The point is very concrete and clear
 isse bihar main udyog lagenge, hamaare yuvaaon ko rojgaar milegaa, or rajya sarkaar ko vikaas ke nae kaarykram chalaane ke liye sansaadhan bhi
 We will achieve that pace of development to reach the average level of the country
 lekin, bijepi na to ye de sakati he, na dena chaahati he, par saream bihar main bhram or jhooth failaa rahi he ‘vishesh atension, vishesh sahyog evam vishesh package’ ityadi kah kar
 'nitish has written,' Amazing! The people of Bihar should sign one crore 18 lakhs, cast their votes in lakhs at rights rallies in Patna and Delhi, take a resolution of the special state in the resolution rallies - and what is the bjp's answer, apologize and even beg
 isse bada apmaan or dhokhaa ho nahin saktaa
 This form which BJP is distributing house to house in Bihar, it is a certificate of insult to every Bihari who should be thrown in the dustbin
 aisa karne se hamaara swabhimaan bhi bachegaa or mahadev kaa maan bhi

 He started his career with plays

 At the time of counseling, all the thumbprints were mixed with the previous mark
 40 se adhik chaatro ke anguuthon ke nishaan mail nahin khaae
 "he further said that it is possible that the rest of the students, like Chetan, have made arrangements to place a professional in their place
 adhikari ne kaha, "ham sandigdh paae gaye 40 chaatro kii phir se counselling karenge

 Deputy Director Admn (SCOR), Doordarshan Bhawan, Copernicus Marg, Mandi House, New Delhi - 110001aavedan kii antim taarikhah24 oktober Former Deputy Prime Minister Sardar Patel, a former Congress leader who was elected president in the Karachi session of the Congress in 1931, Narendra Modi, a lifelong Congress leader, shared the stage with then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh a few months before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when Congress and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru over Sardar Patel While staring at the attack, it was said that till date in every Indian's mind, the first Prime Minister of the country If the three Sardars did not become Patel, then no Congress leader would have thought that this tightness would become a sore point for his party
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii sardaar patel ke naam ko uthaanaa or iske liye congress ko kosne kii ranneeti khud modi or bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke liye phydemand rahi
 Sardar Patel has played an important role in the victory of Narendra Modi
 patel ke naam par rashtrawaad ke mudde ko modi ne lagbhag hit kara diya, lekin congress se unako chin liya
 Sardar Patel, who was also the President of the Congress, was a freedom fighter and the first former Deputy Prime Minister of the country Sardar Patel was a life-long Congressman, but after 7 decades of his death, he is moving away from his own party
 bataur vakil sardaar behad kaamyaab rahe the lekin baad main vah mahatma gandhi se prerit hokar aazaadee ke andolan main kud gaye
 In 1918, Sardar Patel came into the limelight through the Kheda movement
 is andolan ke jariye unhone sookhe kii chapet aae kheda kshetra ke kisaanon ke liye kar main chhot dene kii maang kii
 Sardar Patel, Mahatma Gandhi and others led the farmers and motivated them not to pay taxes
 baad main angrej sarkaar ko jhukna padaa or kisaanon ko kar main raahat de di gai
 Patel received the title of Sardar from the Bardoli Satyagraha and was constantly associated with Gandhi in the freedom movement
 patel 1931 main congress ke karachi adhiveshan main adhyaksh chune gaye
 He was one of the contenders for the post of Prime Minister after independence, but Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru became the Prime Minister
 vah kai vivaadon ke baad bhi congress se jude rahe
 Sardar Patel (gettyimages) With many senior Congress leaders, the Congress is in its worst phase while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is in its golden phase
 congress kii sthiti behad dayaneey ho gai he
 In many states, the situation of Congress has become such that they are not getting even qualified candidates to field against BJP
 narendra modi aazaadee ke baad bharat ke ekikaran kaa shrey sardaar patel ko dete rahe hai
 Before becoming Prime Minister, on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary in 2013, he said that no matter who the party is, the heart should be of the country
 tab unhone kaha tha ki desh ko sardaar patel vaala secularism chahie
 His secularism did not come in the way of building Somnath's temple
 beti maniben or jebi kriplani ke saath sardaar patel (gettyimages)kya ab congress main laut paaenge patel?modi ne jis tarah se sardaar patel ko rashtriya str par purnjivit kiya he or unke naam par congress ko lagaataar koste rahe hai, usase desh kii sabase puraani raajnneetik party ke astitv par hi khatra mandaraane laga he
 After 2014 , the Congress saw a historic decline in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, on the basis of many issues including Modi's aggressive image, Sardar Patel, nationalism, BJP won a historic victory
 aaj congress kii vaapasi kii raah aasaan nahin dikh rahi
 The Congress, which won 415 seats out of 533 Lok Sabha seats in the 1984 elections, performed the worst in 2014 and was reduced to just 44 seats
 jabaki 2019 ke chunaav main bhi uski sthiti main khaas badlaav nahin hua or 52 seat hi hasil kar saki
 The aggression with which Modi raised the name of Sardar Patel and kept it away from the Congress, it seems that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who has been associated with the Congress for a lifetime, has now gone away from this party and from there his return to the Congress It is impossible to get it done

 On New Year's morning, when people were happy to congratulate each other, a shocking news came from a village in Haryana at a distance of a few kilometers from Delhi
 gaanv kii ek sunsaan sadak par ek jali hui car padi thi or car main thim chaar laashen
 But this was not an accident, but a deliberate plot
 yani in chaaron kaa qatl hua tha
 Murder, and that too due to gang war
 dilli ke nazadik haryana kaa gaanv, ishrhedi
 Time 09 in the morning
 30 baje
 Life was still sleepy in this cold morning of January
 ye saal kaa pehla din tha
 One, the haze of the New Year party and the haze and cloud from above also stopped the times like this
 lekin isi sard subah main gaanv ke logon kii nazar ek aise manzar par padi ki unke kadam thithak gaye
 There was a car on the deserted kutcha road of the village, which was completely burnt, but still light smoke was coming out of it
 laash ginana bhi ho rahaa tha mushkildur se ye koi haadasa hi lagata tha
 In which a car suddenly got engulfed in flames and turned to ashes while walking on the way
 lekin jab gaanv ke log is vaardaat kaa sabab jaanane ke iraade se is car ke qareeb pahunche, to andar kaa manzar dekh kar rongte khadey ho gaye
 There were dead bodies in this car
 ji haa, laashen wo bhi ek nahin, balki kai logon kii
 But due to the fire, the condition of these corpses was such that even if they were identified, it was difficult to understand immediately how many corpses were there in this car
 udhar, khabar milte hi bahadurgard police or forensik kii timen maukey par aa pahunchi thi or jab logon ne baariki se is car kaa muyna kiya, to ye saafe hua ki car kii aag main koi ek yaa do nahin, balki chaar-chaar logon kii maut hui he
 That is, it became a pyre of four people in a car surrounded by flames of midnight
 saamne kii seat par nahin thi koi lashlekin ab tak is car main chaar logon kii maut kii jo paheli haadasa or saazish ke bich jhul rahi thi, maukey ke baarik muyne se wo kaafii had tak saafe ho gai
 The fact was that the corpses in the car were of four people, but not a single corpse was on the driving seat or the seat next to it
 balki do laashen car kii pichhali seat par jabaki do or car kii diggi main ati thim
 That is, one thing was clear that this car did not burn suddenly due to some technical fault while walking on the way and neither the people in this car became the victim of any accident
 kyonki agar aisa kuch hota, to kam se kam chaar main se do logon kii laashen car kii samnevaali seat par bhi zarur milteen
 The result of the gang war! But here the matter was strange
 car kii pichhali seat par do laashen thi, jabaki car kii diggi main do or laashen
 Now, because two people could not burn in the car, they could not enter the car
 ye bhi takreeban saafe ho gaya ki kisi ne in chaaron kii jaan lekar unhen car samet aag ke hawaale kar diya tha
 But who could have been the people to do this? And how could anyone burn four people together with a car? Apparently, it was neither the work of any murderer nor did it seem that all the people in the car were alive, but the police suspected that they had burnt them to death in this car
 , So that their identity is also impossible after death
 pehle police ne number plate se car ke maalik kaa pataa lagane kii koshish kii or tab chasis number se
 And in this effort, soon the police came to know that this car of Delhi number belonged to Mitrau, a village in Delhi
 or phir is suraag kii badaulat jald hi naa sirf maranevaalon kii pahchaan ho gai, balki in mauton ke peeche kii jo kahani saamne ai, usne police ko bhi dahala diya
 Because, this was not a minor incident, but the result of a dreadful gang war
 idhar, chaar ladakon ke maut kii khabar saamne ai or udhar ek paanchvaan ladkaa police ke saamne aa gaya
 He said that he had heard the last scream of his friends before death
 apane mobile phone se uske ek dost ne khud ke dushmano se ghir jane kii baat bataai or iske baad uskaa phone band ho gaya tha
 Shot first shot! Haryana Police has identified the owner of the car with the registration number DL8CAF 7229 and chassis number
 lekin is maamle ko puri tarah sulajhane se pehle use abhi kai pechon-kham se guzaranaa tha
 Meanwhile, during the forensic investigation, police also recovered a bullet from the car itself
 in chaar mauton ke peeche qatl kaa shaq to pehle se hi tha, lekin car se mili goli ne is shaq ko thodaa or pukhta kar diya
 Because the bullet was pointing to the fact that these boys were targeted with bullets before setting them on fire, including the car
 or aise main yaa to ye goli jalane ke baad kisi ke jism se baahar nikal ai yaa phir is car main bitha kar hi in ladakon ko yaa phir inamen se kuch ko goli maari gai
 On the other hand, as the day went on, the identity of the four young men, including the car, disappeared
 ye ladke the dilli ke ek gaanv mitrau ke manish, sandip, sudhir or gaanv samaspur kaa deepak
 Deepak's age was just 17 years old
 lekin jis tarah car main laashen milin, shaq he ki wo bhi apane doston ke saath qaatilon kaa shikaar ban gaya
 On being told by Bahadurgarh police, the boys' families also reached the spot and tried to identify the dead bodies
 lekin jis tarah se ye laashen jali hui thim, usase inaki shinaakht bhi mushkil ho rahi thi
 This was the reason that the family members, after seeing the dead bodies, reached Delhi again and wrote to the police about the missing reports of their children
 lekin tafteesh main lagi police ko is vaardaat ke peeche gangvaar kaa shaq to pehle hi ho chukaa tha, car se saath ghar se gaayab hue kuch ladakon ke gharavaale bhi police kii is theory par muhar laga rahe the
 Not only did he suspect many more boys to be involved in this incident, but also said that some suspicious boys were seen in the village on the night of 31 December
 ab police aakiri baar in ladakon yani manish, sandip, sudhir or deepak ko zindaa dekhanevaale shaks kii talash main lagi thi
 
 
 So that the whole story of the journey from his village i
e
 Mitrau to mouka-e-vardat i
e
 village Isheri could be cleared
 31 disambar ko party main hua jhagada?isi bich police ko ek or chaunkaanewaali baat pataa chali
 According to the sources, during the investigation, the police found a person who had heard the conversation of these boys on the phone on the night of the murder
 darasal, ye chaaron ladke 31 disambar kii raat ko apane gaanv main hi bhupesh naam ke ek ladke ke ghar new year kii party ke liye ikatta hue the
 Where everyone had drinks and dinner together
 or takreeban 12:30 baje ye chaaron vahaan se ravaanaa ho gaye
 But after this, at around 1
23 in the night, Sudhir called Bhupesh from his mobile phone and told him that he had a fight with some boys from the village and they were badly surrounded
 bhupesh ne police ko bataaya he ki iske baad sudhir ke saath maujuud uske teenon dost manish, sandip or deepak ke bhi mobile phone rahasyamayi tareeke se band ho gaye
 And now on the second day, the way the bodies of four people were found in Sandeep's car, he suspects that all four have been killed, but the boys whose names were taken by Sudhir before the murder last night were his four friends
 Has been put to death
 police sutron kii maane to bhupesh se aakhri baar mobile par baat karanevaala sudhir beeti raat behad ghabaraaya hua tha
 While he was telling him about the trouble he faced, Bhupesh allegedly also heard the sound of the bullet and shortly after that the mobile phone went off
 lekin raat guzarate hi, jo kahani dilli ke in do gaanvon tak pahunchi, usne sabhi ke hosh uda die

 Literacy rate has increased more than four times
 khadyann main aatmanirbharta praapt karne ke baad ab ham khadyann ke niryaatak hai

 " Pranab Mukherjee, who had seen the finance department in the central government before coming to the presidency, said that India has set a long journey since 1947
 1947 main pehla bajet mahaj 171 karod rupye kaa tha
 Today the resources of the central government are more like an ocean than that drop
 raashtrapati ne kaha ki yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki aarthik vikaas ke laabh par suvidha sampann varg kaa ekadhikaar na ho jaae, balki isaki jagah iskaa istemaal bhukhmaree, garibi or kam aay main guzaara karne kii majaburi jaisi buraaiyon se muqabla karne main ho
 The President said that the basic objective of creation of wealth should be to root out the evil of starvation, poverty and under-livelihood from our growing population
 unhone kaha, "aankadon kaa un logon ke liye koi arth nahin hota jinhen unase laabh nahin pahunchataa
 We have to work immediately, otherwise, the turbulent areas that are currently referred to as 'naxalite' violence may expand more dangerously
 " Referring to 2012 being the year of examination as India's move towards the next round of economic reforms, the President said, "we have to be aware of the current problems of market-based economies
 " unhone kaha, "bahut se dhani raashtra ab saamaajik daayitv rahit adhikaar kii samskruti ke jaal main funs gaye hai; hamen is jaal se bachanaa hoga

 " President Mukherjee was hurt by the brutal gang rape incident in the national capital last month
 unhone kaha, "main aapako aise samay par sambodhit kar rahaa hum, jab ek bahut vyapak traasadee ne hamaari antaratma ko jhakzor daalaa he
 The brutal rape and murder of a young woman, a woman who was a symbol of the aspirations of a rising India, the cruelty with which has filled our hearts with emptiness and our hearts with anger
 hamane ek jaan se kahin adhik kuch khoyaa he, hamane ek sapana kho diya he
 If our youth is angry today, can we blame our youth? "he said," There is a law of the country
 lekin usase ooncha bhi ek kanoon he
 Purity of women is the guiding principle of the overall philosophy called Indian civilization
 veda kehete hai ki mata ek se adhik ho sakati hai, janmdatri, gurupatni, raja kii patni, pujari kii patni, hamen doodh pilaane vaali or hamaari mathrubhumi
 Mother protects us from evil and oppression, a symbol of life and prosperity for us
 jab ham kisi mahila ke saath pashaviktaa karte hai to apni sabhyataa kii aatma ko lahooluhaan kar daalate hai

 england ne 1917 se agle ek dashak tak vahaan baari sainya shakti kaa istemaal karke tel ke kuon par apana kabja banaae rakhaa
 The British gave him independence after ruling there for thirty years
 saddaam ke jariye america kii entriuske baad 1972 tak to sab kuch thik chalaa or phir vahaan kii sarkaar ne tel kuon kaa rashtriyakaran kar diya
 This is where the whole problem started
 isse england or america ke hiton ko baari chot pahunchi kyonki tab tak iraq petroleum company angrejon or america hiton ko dhyaan main rakh rahi thi
 After this, America started playing its cards and got revolted and gave power to Saddam Hussein's Baath Party
 saddaam hossain ko baad main lagane laga ki vah taqatvar ho gaye hai to unhone kuwait par hamalaa karne kii galati kii jiskaa nateeja pehle khadi yuddh ke rup main mila
 The US not only freed Kuwait by invading Iraq but also recovered its hefty price
 60 fisadi hai shiya, lekin sunni bhi kam taqatvar nahiitna hi nahin jhootha aarope lagaakar usne england ke saath milakar 2003 main iraq par puri tarah kabja bhi kar liya
 Iraq gained independence in 2011 but by then even Saddam Hussein's family had been wiped out
 saddaam ne apane lambey shashan kaal main iraq ko ek samrudh or majboot desh banaaya
 But after he was hanged, the balance of internal power there was disturbed
 vahaan ke pradhanmantri nuri al-maaliki shiya hai or unhone sunni samudaay ko vishwaas main lene kii kabhi koshish nahin kii
 The Shia and Sunni-divided Iraqis account for about 60 per cent of Shias, but the Sunni groups have been strong enough to rule there
 pichley saal bhi sunni ladaakon ne kii thi baghawatpichley saal sunni ladaakon ne pashchimi iraq ke shaharon faluja or ramaadi ko tahas nahas kar diya
 Faluja was captured
 ab unke ladaake mosul shahar ko jitate hue baghdad kii ore bad rahe hai
 There is fierce fighting and thousands of people have been killed
 iraq kii sarkaar bachane ke liye america se guhaar laga rahi he or kah rahi he ki vah hamalaavaron par hamale kare
 But this is the difference between Barack Obama and George Bush
 bush hote to ab tak america sena bhej chuke hote lekin obama itnaa bada jokhim nahin lenaa chaahate
 They know that it can have complex consequences later
 bush iraq fujen bhejkar behad alokapriy ho gaye the
 America also had to pay a very high economic price
 kya vibhaajan kii taraf bad rahaa iraq?bahut se america to maanate hai ki yah satta santulan kaa swaabhaavik maamla he jisamen iraq ke do tukade bhi ho sakate hai
 Even if this happens, the US does not mind much and that is the reason that American companies are losing interest in Iraq's oil reserves
 nai technology ke istemaal se uski dusron par nirbharta kam hoti ja rahi he or venezuela tathaa canada se tel kii aapurti badhane se uske paas tel kii kami nahin he
 America is a merchant country and every step of it arises according to profit and loss
 is baar bhi vah vaise hi faisle karegaa
 The meaning is clear, Iraqis will have to fight their own battles even if the country is split into two

 It states that when and when the Pakistan Agency had put money in its account

 When Yograj was asked if playing 21 balls by his son was the main reason for India losing to Sri Lanka in Mirpur, he said, "yuvraj should not be held responsible alone
 ' viraat kohli ne phir ek shandaar pari khelte hue toornament main apana chauthaa ardhshtak jadaa, lekin srilankai gendbaajon ne jujh rahe yuvaraj par shikanja ksaa jisase scoring gati par kaaphi asar padaa
 He looked completely in poor form, which also frustrated the batsman in form at the other end
 antim chaar over main keval 19 ran bane kyonki yuvaraj bade hit lagane main asafal rahe
 Yograj said that when a team loses there is a lot of criticism all around
 unhone kaha, 'jab ham haarate hai chaaron ore se aalochana hoti he
 The ups and downs are part of life and it was also a part of this match
 ' In recent times, Yuvraj is going through a poor form, to which Yograj said, 'when a player goes through a bad phase, the mental state becomes such that he starts thinking that if he cannot score runs He will be out of the team or the team will lose
 ' yograj ne kaha ki khel ke liye khilaadi kii khel bhaavana zyada mahatvapurn hoti he
 He said, 'when the West Indies lost to India in the 1983 World Cup, Sir Viv Richards went to the Indian dressing room and congratulated the team and said that they played better cricket and they deserved the win

 kyonki 2022 se aage 2025 yani sangh ke shatabdi varsh tak modi satta barkaraar rahe to hi sangh kaa vistaar puure desh main ho paaegaa
 This is the thinking, so in 2019 it will not be said exactly what Modi did in the last 5 years, but what will be the target of 2022, it will be told to the public, so that the public should not miss the 60 months demanded in 2014
 2022 main puri hone vaali yojanaayensvachh bharat, vaikalpik urja or pradhanmantri awaas yojana samet darjan bhar yojanaon kaa hoga, jisase janata khud kii modi sarkaar ko 2022 tak kaa vakt ye soch kar de den ki tamaam yojanaayen to 2022 main puri hogi, or bahut hi baariki se new india kaa naaraa bhi 2022 tak kaa rakhaa gaya he

 BJP national general secretary Ramlal will be given the command of Vidyarthi Parishad in place of Sunil Ambekar, who is heading the Vidyarthi Parishad, that is the question that Modi will also be 75 in 2025, then the youth leadership will be Methods of making will have to be developed now

 After the construction of this road, it will take only 45 minutes to go from Delhi to Meerut, while at present, this route takes more than 3 hours due to frequent traffic jams

 After inspecting the work being done on the road today, Nitin Gadkari said that the first phase of expressway from Nizamuddin Bridge to Delhi UP Border has been completed 75 percent and work is going on fast

 ho bhi kyon na, aakhir 30 sitambar se pehle audited tex ritern jo bharna he
 Apart from this, hundreds of letters are being written daily to the country's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley that please extend the deadline a little
 aakhir tex canceltent samaysima badhaane kii maang kyon kar rahe hai, yah jaananaa behad jaruri he
 Now first understand what this issue is
 aamtaur par naukareepesha yaa kisi bhi kamai karne vaale, jise aamadani kaa audit nahin karwaanaa hota he, use 31 july tak inkam tex ritern bharna hota he, vahiin jinka audit jaruri hota he jaise ki 25 lakh se zyada salanaa vetan paane vaale yaa kamai karne vaale log or privet companiyaan, unke riterns (audit ke saath) bharne kii antim tithi 30 sitambar hoti he
 This system has been in operation for years
 aamtaur par 31 july ko saamaanya naukareepesha logon ke ritern file ho jate hai or phir companiyon ke audited ritern file karne ke liye 60 din milte hai, lekin is saal maamla gadabada gaya he
 In the first month of May, the Income Tax Department uploaded the format of filing returns of common people on its website
 is formet main kai sari jaankariyaan maangi gayi thi, jo dena mushkil ho rahaa tha
 It was natural that there was a lot of criticism in the country
 is aalochana ke chalate inakam tex vibhaag ne ise waapas le liya
 Then nothing happened for 50 days and finally on July 29, a new format was released so that people could pay income tax accordingly
 apni is spasht naakaami ke chalate inakam tex vibhaag ne samay badhaakar 31 agast kar diya
 At the same time, due to the Patidar agitation in Gujarat, violence took place, then the date was extended to 7 September
 ab aakhirkaar aamalogon ke inkam tex ritern 7 sitambar ko bhare gayi
 Rajni Shah, Gujarat's leading chartered accountant, says that the time it was 60 days ago to file tax returns after an audit, this year has been reduced to hardly 23 days
 aise main quality kaam kii umid kaise kii jaae
 That is why there is a demand for extension of time, but in a press release issued by the Finance Department on September 9, it has been made clear that the time period will not be extended
 sarkaar ne tark diya he ki formet main zyada pherbadal nahin kiya gaya he
 Shah says that if only minor changes have been made, then why did the department take a year to upload the format, because last year the budget was presented in July itself
 kai logon ko lagata he ki is saal inakam tex vibhaag tex canceltent se badla le rahaa he
 After all, the story of what changed, its story is also interesting and surprising
 aamtaur par jo bhi tids (tex katkar kisi ko vetan dena) katata he use har timahi par vah dhanrashi sarkaar ke paas jamaa karwaani hoti he or phir privet companiyon ko 15 din main or sarkari vibhaagon ko 30 din main report darj karwaani hoti he
 If it is delayed, then you will have to pay a fine of Rs 200 per day
 vaise yah niyam varshon se he, phir bhi jurmaana nahin liya jaataa tha, lekin 2012-13 kii duusari timahi se achaanak lakhon logon ko jurmaane ke notice pahunchane lage
 Everybody was surprised
 maamla court pahunchaa, lekin mukadmaa karne waalon ne sabhi sarkari vibhaagon se bhi artiai ke tahat jaankariyaan jutani shuru kin ki kya yah notice privet companiyon ke saath sarkari ko bhi mila he, yaa kya sarkari mahakme yah report samay par bharte hai
 The facts that came into this were shocking
 controlar and auditor general or yahaan tak ki inakam tex vibhaag khud bhi samay se yah report file nahin karata, lekin unke khilaaf to karrwai nahin hoti
 There was a lot of noise on this
 sarkaar ne apane vibhaagon par lagaam to nahin kasi, balki unhen iske liye 31 march 2014 tak kaa samay de diya
 The comments rajani shah kehete hai ki shaayad yah pehali baar ho rahaa tha ki kanoon ek hi tha, lekin privet companiyon par lagu hua or sarkari vibhaagon ko chhot de di gai
 He has never seen such discrimination before
 isse jude kai maamle desh kii alag-alag adaalaton main bhi vichaaradhin hai, lekin sawaal yah uthta he ki jab digital india kii muhim chal rahi he to kya desh main buniyadi tex vyavastha bhi kabhi sucharu ho paaegi? After all, it is very important to know why the tax consultants are seeking to extend the deadline
 ab pehle samaj len ki yah masalaa kya he
 Normally, the jobber or any earner who does not have to get income audit, has to file income tax return by 31 July, while those who are required to be audited such as those earning or earning more than 25 lakhs per annum
 People and private companies, the last date for filing their returns (with audit), is 30 September
 yahi system varshon se chalaa aa rahaa he
 Usually, on July 31, the returns of ordinary employed people are filed and then 60 days are received for filing the audited returns of the companies, but this year the matter has gone awry
 inakam tex vibhaag ne pehle may maheene main hi aam logon ke ritern file karne kaa formet apni website par aplod kar diya
 Many information was sought in this format, which was difficult to give
 swaabhaavik tha ki desh main isaki bahut aalochana hui
 Due to this criticism, the Income Tax Department withdrew it
 phir 50 dinon tak kuch nahin hua or aakhirkaar 29 july ko nayaa formet jari hua, taaki log uske mutabik inakam tex bhar saken
 Due to this apparent failure, the Income Tax Department extended the time to 31 August
 isi dauraan gujarat main patidaar andolan ke chalate hinsa ho gai, to taarikh 7 sitambar tak badha di gai
 Now finally the income tax returns of the people were filed on 7 September
 gujarat ke agrani chartered accountint rajani shah kehete hai ki aise main audit karne ke baad tex ritern bharne kaa jo samay pehle 60 din tha, vah is saal ghatakar mushkil se 23 din rah gaya
 In such a situation how to expect quality work
 isiliye samay badhaane kii maang kii ja rahi he, lekin vitt vibhaag kii 9 sitambar ko jari ek press relies main saaf kar diya gaya he ki samyavadhi nahin badhaai jaaegi
 The government has argued that the format has not been overhauled
 shah kehete hai ki agar maamuli pherbadal hi kiye gaye hai to vibhaag ko formet aplod karne main ek saal kaa samay kyon laga, kyonki pichley saal bajet to july main hi pesh ho gaya tha
 Many feel that this year the Income Tax Department is taking revenge on the tax consultant
 aakhir kis baat kaa badla, isaki kahani bhi dilachasp or haroonges he
 Normally whoever deducts TDS (pay tax after deducting tax) has to deposit that amount with the government every quarter and then private companies have to file a report in 15 days and government departments in 30 days
 isamen agar deree hui to aapako pratidin 200 rupee kii dar se jurmaana dena hoga
 Although this rule has been in place for years, fines were still not charged, but from the second quarter of 2012-13, notices of fines suddenly started reaching millions
 sabhi aashcharya main the
 The matter reached the court, but the litigants also started collecting information from all government departments under the RTI whether the government has received this notice along with private companies, or whether the government departments fill this report on time
 isamen jo tathy aae vah chaunkaane vaale the
 The Controller and Auditor General and even the Income Tax Department themselves do not file this report in time, but action is not taken against them
 is par kaaphi shor machaa
 The government did not tighten its departments, but gave them time till 31 March 2014 for this
 tippaniyan Rajni Shah says that this was probably the first time that the law was the same, but applied to private companies and government departments were exempted
 aisa bhedbhaav unhone pehle kabhi nahin dekha
 Many cases related to this are also under consideration in different courts of the country, but the question arises that when the Digital India campaign is going on, will the basic tax system in the country ever be smooth? ab pehle samaj len ki yah masalaa kya he
 Normally, the jobber or any earner who does not have to get income audit, has to file income tax return by 31 July, while those who are required to be audited such as those earning or earning more than 25 lakhs per annum

 vayusena se jude log ise ultimate 'jugad' kehete hai - hawa se hawa main maar karne vaali rus-nirmit missile ko israel-nirmit helmet-mounted disple ke saath chalaanaa, jise bhartiya vayusena ke payalat france-nirmit miraj-2000 ladaaku vimaan udaate hue pahante hai
 And not only this, the Indian Air Force (IAF) has been using this 'jugaad' for the last almost 10 years while flying its Mirage-2000 fighter aircraft
 varsh 1985 main bhartiya vayusena main shaamil kiye gaye miraj vimaanon main feet kii jane vaali hawa se hawa main maar karne vaali france-nirmit R-530D or magic II misile varsh 2008 tak aprachlit ho chuki thim, or inke bina IAF ke miraj vimaanon main koi missile hoti hi nahin
 In the presence of very few options and considering the long process of acquiring the missiles, the IAF decided to integrate the existing Russian R-73 missiles into the Mirage
 R-73 misile bhartiya vayusena ke sukhoi 30, mig-29 or mig-21 'bison' vimaanon par pehle se tainaat thim, lekin unhen kisi pashchimi desh se aae plateform par integrat karne kii koshish kabhi nahin kii gai thi
 Not only this, the French government also opposed the move, as they did not want to help any Russian missile being integrated on the French platform, especially when they had newly designed French missiles exported to India

 R-73 mixilon ko DASH helmet se jodne ke bare main sochna jitna aasaan tha, asaliyat main aisa kar paanaa kahin zyaada mushkil tha
 One Air Force officer, who was aware of the problems related to integration, said, "there were many important challenges
 
 
 " unhone bataaya, "yah ek nayaa helmet tha, or ham sorce code ke bina kaam kar rahe the
 
 
 "in other words, such algorithms were to be built, so that Mirage's radar and Israeli helmet-mounted sites could 'understand the antics' of Russian missiles on their own

 is tarah kaa ek squadran, yaa 18 vimaan IAF main pehle hi shaamil kiye ja chuke hai
 An Air Force pilot familiar with this upgrade process stated, "the MICA missile is nearly four times more capable than the R-73 in close combat, and is also integrated with the (israeli) DASH helmet-mounted site
" 
 
 "rus-nirmit R-73 vahi missile he, jiskaa istemaal wing commander abhinandan vardhaman ne 27 farvari ko niyantran rekha par mig-21 'bison' ladaaku vimaan udaate hue pakistani epa-16 ladaaku vimaan ko maar giraane ke liye kiya tha

 But its effect was not seen in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday
 congress saansad kumari shailaja ke gujarat main ek mandir jane par unki jati puche jane ke do din puraane maamle ko bijepi ne uthaa diya, phir kya tha jo kuch bhi saurhaad pradhanmantri ke bhaashan se bana tha wo ek minute main khatm ho gaya
 In fact, the Leader of the House in Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley said that a woman MP of Congress had complained about the temple of Gujarat about which caste is asked in India even after so many years of independence, in the visitor's book of the same temple He has praised the temple very much
 jabaab main kumari shailaja ne safai main kaha ki unhone dwarika ke mukhya mandir kaa zikr nahin kiya tha, unka matlab bet dwarika mandir se tha
 The Bet Dwarka or Shankhodar temple is different from the main Dwarka temple
 bet dwarika mandir ek tapu par he, jahaan dwarika se jane main ek ghanta lagata he or vahaan naav yaa steamer se hi pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 The opposition and the government got very worried about this much
 ek puraane maamle kii vajah se rajyasabha kii kaarywahi baar-baar rokani paddy
 The Leader of Opposition was asking the House to apologize, then the government side Kumari Selja
 tippaniyan Somehow there was a reconciliation between the two sides, but then the debate on the flood in Chennai could be started by avoiding the debate on inflation, that is also because it has a human aspect attached to it
 sawaal yahi uthta he ki sarkaar kii taraf se shailaja kaa mudda kyon uthaaya gaya
 Was it under any strategy, because even if this does not arise, no one would mind
 bahes to khatm ho chuki thi
 The Prime Minister's reply had also arrived
 kya yah maamla rahul gandhi ke loksabhaa main kiye gaye sarkaar par tikhe hamalon kii vajah se hua
 Was it also because the Congress started demanding the stop work proposal as soon as the Lok Sabha proceedings started? ke
 They had reached Vail, starting demanding Singh's resignation
 congress ke loksabhaa se walk out karte hi bijepi kii taraf se rajyasabha main kumari shailaja kaa maamla uthaa or sabko saath lekar chalane kaa taana-bana tahas-nahas ho gaya
 If the game of check and check continues in the winter session of Parliament in the same way, then it will be a little hasty to say what will happen to the important bills of the government
 darasal rajyasabha main sadan ke netaa arun jetali ne kaha ki congress kii ek mahila saansad ne gujarat ke jis mandir ke bare main jati puche jane kii shikaayat kii thi ki aazaadee ke itane saalon baad bhi bharat main aisa hota he, usee mandir ke visitor book main unhone mandir kii khub prashansa kii he
 In response, Kumari Selja said in a clarification that he did not mention the main temple of Dwarka, he meant the Bet Dwarka temple
 bet dwarika yaa shankhodar mandir mukhya dwarika mandir se alag he
 The Bet Dwarka temple is on an island, which takes an hour to reach from Dwarka and can be reached only by boat or steamer
 itani si baat ko lekar vipaksh or sarkaar main than gai
 Due to an old case, the proceedings of Rajya Sabha had to be stopped again and again

 The comments kisi tarah donon pakshon main sulah hui, magar tab manhagaai par bahes ko taalkar chennai main baadh par bahes shuru kii ja saki, wo bhi isliye ki isse maanviya pahalu juda hua he
 The question arises as to why the issue of Shailaja was raised by the government
 kya yah kisi ranneeti ke tahat tha, kyonki yadi yah maamla nahin bhi uthta to kisi ko koi fark nahin padataa
 The debate was over
 pradhanmantri kaa jabaab bhi aa chukaa tha
 Was this case due to the sharp attacks on Rahul Gandhi's government in the Lok Sabha
 kya yah isliye bhi hua ki congress ne loksabhaa kii kaarywahi shuru hote hi kaam roko prastaav kii maang shuru kar ve
 K
 singh ke istife kii maang shuru karte hue wel main pahunch gaye the
 As soon as the Congress walked out of the Lok Sabha, the matter of Kumari Selja was raised in the Rajya Sabha on behalf of the BJP and the process of taking everyone along was destroyed
 yadi sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main bhi isi tarah se shah or maat kaa khel chalata rahaa to sarkaar ke mahatvarpun bilon kaa kya hoga kahana thodi jaldbaaji hogi
 The Bet Dwarka or Shankhodar temple is different from the main Dwarka temple

 Before i became CEO, our CEO was Anne Malkehi, who took the company through difficult times
 aisa karke unhone meri raah aasaan kar di or mujhe aisi company kii bagdor saunpi jisamen koi vittiya kathinaayee nahin thi, jisamen lacheelaapan tha, jisaki buniyaad majboot thi or aisi ranneeti thi jo pehle se kaam kar rahi thi
 My job when i became CEO was to find ways to speed it up
 hamane koi chota rasta nahin apanaaya, hamane khub mehnat kii, hamen vishwaas tha
 
 
 We have such a blue collar company of engineering whose foundation is so solid that we can face enormous challenges and handle a lot of work
 purv siio ain ke netritv main hamane shuruyaat kii or document outsorcing kaa kaarobaar karne lage
 His advantage was that me and the team working under the guidance of Anne at the time, got a chance to think of other things that we could do because the business was running
 hamen to duusare kaarobaar ke bare main sochna tha, hamane aasapaas dekha or us samay kuch companiyon kaa adhigrahan kar liya, legal outsorcing, i-discovery outsorcing, mortges processing outsorcing
 
 
 Our aim was to buy these small companies and increase their size
 par jab maine us par gaur kiya to laga ki yah to chalata hi rahegaa, in choti ek karod dollar kii companiyon ko kharidne main bahut vakt lagegaa or usamen jokhim bhi bahut he
 We looked and thought and kept thinking and then we bumped into this company called ACS
 asies pehle hi kaaphi badi ho chuki thi or usne kai tarah ke bipio jaise kaarobaar chalaa rakhe the
 We bought that company and that was necessary because since then we have bought a lot of companies and connected them to ACS
 choti companiyaan khareednaa or unhen ek badi company main milaanaa or choti company ko sthirataa dekar apana dayera failaana asies kaa itihaas rahaa he
 You have been working at Xerox from the beginning
 kya aapako lagata he ki isse netritv or company ko badlaav or chunauti ke daur main aage le jane laayak aatmavishvaas ke hisaab se bada baari fark padaa he? yaa iskaa ulta asar ho saktaa he kyonki aap puraane niyamon or puraane taur-tareekon se bahut zyada bandhi hui hai?jahaan tak jirox or kam-se-kam pichley do siio kaa sawaal he to company ko koi aisa leader milanaa behad jaruri tha jise company ke itihaas kii gahari jaankaree ho or jisane uske kuch hisse khud jie hon
 So it happened
 hamane shuruyaat is shabd—blue collar—se kii or main jirox main jaan-boojhkar iskaa istemaal karti hum
 Blue collar companies or working people are the heart and soul of most economies
 log hi to hai jo kadi mehnat karte hai, log chunautiyon se nahin darate, log hi mil-julkar kaam karte hai, log hi apane daayitv se aage badhkar kaam karne ko taiyaar rahete hai
 Now the changes we are making mean that we are moving from only product business to product and service business, and 'end' is very important in that
 agar mujhe puri jaankaree nahin hogi ki hamane ateet main kya kiya he to main sab kuch khatm kar duungi or bahut bade badlaav kar duungi or is maamle main bahut sari galtiyaan bhi karuungi ki kya rakhana he or kaise apana dayera badhanaa he or jo kuch rakhane kii aavashyaktaa he use kaise sahejnaa he
 You can turn your eyes towards all of that, but there are many things that remind me of all of that, so i want to keep working as best i can and don't stick to things that don't cost too long is
 aapke management main 30 bade padon main se 11 mahilaayein hai
 Do you think that this has changed the situation of Xerox? The identity of the company is actually formed by meeting different identities or personalities related to it
 mujhe sau fisadi yakeen he ki hamaari company kii pahchaan or hamaare jhukaav par is baat kaa asar padaa he ki hamen lagaataar do baar mahila siio milin
 There is no doubt about it
 dilchaspee kii baat yah he ki hamaara logon ko bhartee karne kaa tarika shaayad bahut zyada nahin badla he
 We got two successful ceos because someone had previously recruited them so the identity of the company is not associated with gender but of a company that enables women to show their qualifications very easily
 aap kahati hai ki mahilaayein asamanjas main rahati hai
 What is this? i know so many women who actually experience it and i still sometimes feel it myself
 jab maine shuruyaat kii thi, jab main ejeeniyar thi, jab main ejineering pard rahi thi, jab main ejeeniyar ban gai, jab main ejineering kii manager bani, jab main bijness kii manager bani
 
 
 Every time i was different, not because i was anything smart, but because i was a woman
 main ashwet thi
 This was my special thing
 meraa yuva hona bhi bahut badi baat thi
 i had no control over all those things, right? But we have done a lot of introspection
 mardon ko isaki koi phikr nahin hoti
 They get up from bed and go to work
 sab kuch hameshaa kii tarah or ve jahaan hai usase bahut santusht hai
 Women do not necessarily have to be content with themselves in the same way
 ve jahaan he vahaan tak unhen khud ko le janaa padataa he jisase ve aatmamanthan ke liye majaboor ho jaati hai
 They think a lot before doing anything, they stop even before they think
 ve thodi zyada chaukas hoti hai
 Actually, we women are more confused about our abilities than men, criticize ourselves a lot and are very careful
 fasebuk sioo sheril sandburg ne kitaab likhi he leen in
 i am not a person to lean forward or backward
 asal main ve kahana yah chaah rahi hai ki ham mahilaayein peeche kadam bahut hataati hai, aisa isliye nahin ki ham kam smart hai yaa training thik nahin he, yaa apni baat sateek dhang se nahin rakh paati hai
 Our voices are always different so we are always confused whether we are really right? The men who say about us whether she even came because she is a woman, is she here because she is black, mean The things that men talk about us, we start asking the same questions to ourselves
 main swayan kabhi-kabhi aisa karti hum jo dilachasp he kyonki main to company kii siio ban chuki hum
 We women are more confused about our abilities than men

 The central government is directly responsible for the incident that is happening on the citizenship law

 Chairman of ISRO

 Sivan said that Chandrayaan-2 will undergo a rigorous examination while going to the moon's orbit
 chand kii gurutvkarshan shakti 65000 kimi tak rahata he
 In such a situation, the speed of Chandrayaan-2 will have to be reduced
 nahin to, chand kii gurutvkarshan shakti ke prabhaav main aakar vah usase takaraa bhi saktaa he
 To reduce the speed, the onboard propulsion system of Chandrayaan-2 will be operational for a while
 is dauraan ek choti si chook bhi yaan ko aniyantrit kar sakati he
 This will be a test for not only Chandrayaan-2 but also for scientists
 chand se na takaraae chandrayan-2 isliye gati kii jaaegi kamchaand kii gurutvkarshan shakti kaa prabhaav 65,000 kilometre tak he
 That is, the moon can pull any object coming up to this distance from the moon

 The operation has been called off following the stone pelting incident by the local people
 vaise vayusena ne ab tak is oparation ke jariye lagbhag 900 logon ko bachaaya he

 The 124th Amendment of the Constitution was passed by both the Houses of Parliament, after which the way for 10 percent reservation for the general class has been cleared
 is aarakshan par argedy, AIADMK or AIMIM ko chhodkar congress sahit sattapaksh or vipaksh ke zyaadaatar dal samarthan main najar aae
 As a result, this bill was passed in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha houses within 48 hours, but 3 votes were cast in the Lok Sabha and 7 in the Rajya Sabha against the bill
 iske paksh or vipaksh donon ke apane-apane raajnneetik sameekaran hai
 The BJP has lost power due to the displeasure of the upper castes in the recently held state assembly elections
 aise main modi sarkaar ne loksabhaa chunaav se ain pehle savarna samudaay ko saadhane kii liye saamaanya varg ke liye 10 fisadi aarakshan kaa card chalaa he
 On Modi's stance, the opposition was seen standing together, not wanting to
 haalanki argedy netaa tejasvi ne yaad iske virodh main khadey hokar apni alag siyaasi lakeer khinchne kii koshish kii he
 The Modi government on Tuesday introduced the Constitution Amendment Bill of 10 percent reservation for poor people of the general category in the Lok Sabha
 loksabhaa main is vidheyak ke samarthan main 323 saansadon ne matdaan kiya jabaki vipaksh main 3 vot daale gaye the
 Voting in the Opposition (AIADMK) m Thambidurai, iuml's ET Mohammed Bashir and aimim's Asaduddin Owaisi cast their votes
 vahiin rajyasabha main bill ke paksh main 165 vot pade jabaki 7 saansadon ne iske khilaaf vot kiya
 The seven votes against which were against the high court included RJD and AIADMK and DMK members
 argedy netaaon ne is vidheyak kaa khuletaur par virodh kiya or ise dalit, pichhadon or adivaasiyon ko milane vaale aarakshan ko khatm karne ek sajeesh qaraar diya tha
 He had said that if efforts are being made to provide 10 percent reservation to 15 percent upper caste population, then the scope of reservation for 27 percent of OBC should be increased to 52 percent
 argedy saansad is vidheyak kaa virodh karte hue loksabhaa se walkout kar gaye, jabaki rajyasabha main unhone khilaaf vot kiya
 Actually, RJD is trying to establish itself as the biggest supporter of dalit-obc reservation by standing up against this bill
 argedy ne isse pehle 2015 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan bhi dalit or obisi maton ko focus kiya tha
 The RJD never retained its image as a pro-upper caste
 aise main is vidheyak ke virodh ke pich bihar ke dalit or obisi matadaata hai
 Lalu Prasad Yadav's politics has also been around this
 vahiin, AIADMK or diemke ke virodh ke peeche bhi raajnneetik or jaateey sameekaran hai
 Reservation in Tamil Nadu is already 69 per cent, which includes SC, ST and OBC
 is aarakshan ke daayre main tamilnadu kii 87 fisadi jansankhya aati he
 This means that the population of the upper caste community in the state is very less
 AIADMK or diemke ke virodh ke peeche soobe ke 87 fisadi log hai
 In such a situation, they cannot afford their displeasure by supporting the Modi government's 10 percent upper caste reservation
 baat britain kii he jahaan ek 14 saal kii ladki kii ek gambhir beemaari se maut ho gai lekin jate jate usne ek abhootpurv adhikaar hasil kar liya
 On Friday, a London court confirmed the decision to freeze the body of the girl
 bataa den ki marane se pehle ladki ne jaj ko ek chitthee main likhaa tha ki vah cancer se peedit he or vah 'lanbaa jeene' ke liye ek or mauka chaahati he
 The victim girl had decided to undergo cryonics after much research under which the person's body is frozen after death so that the body is expected to be alive with the help of future medical advances
 ladki ne jaj ko likhe patr main kaha tha ki 'main sirf 14 saal kii hum or main maranaa nahin chaahati lekin main jaanati hum ki main marane vaali hum
 It is further written in the letter that 'I think the cryo process can give me another chance to recover and get back up, then why not take 100 years of it
' ' The victim has also given her mother the right under legal proceedings that in future, she can cremate her daughter if she wants
 vaise is faisle main maa ne apni beti kaa saath hi diya he

 IPL charismatic commissioner Lalit Modi was sacked last year after being accused of financial irregularities, while two franchises Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals are struggling in court with the BCCI to stay in the league

 The Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday accused the Congress of doing 'communal politics' and tried to make him a hero by delaying the arrest of Akbaruddin Owaisi, the leader of the majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen, who made inflammatory speeches
 bhaajapa netaa prakaash jaavdekar ne yahaan mediakarmiyon se kaha ki landan se swadesh pahunchane par ovaisi ko turant giraftaar kiya janaa chahie tha
 Javadekar said, 'congress is giving them protection
 uski niyat main khot he
 He claimed that the ruling Congress in Andhra Pradesh wanted the support of MIM in the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation election, and was therefore paying its price
 unhone kaha ki prakriya ke anusaar, yadi koi aaropee kharaab swasthya kii shikaayat karata he to use pehle adaalat main pesh kiya jaataa he or uske baad use aspataal le jaaya jaataa he
 Javadekar questioned, 'why was it not done?'
 'ovaisi ko police ne bhadakaau bhaashan ke silsile main notice bheja tha or poochtacha ke liye hajir hone ko kaha tha
 But after returning from London on Monday, he had sought four days of extra time for production citing poor health, after which police took him to the hospital for a health test
 antat mangalvaar shaam ko ovaisi kii giraftaar kii gai
 At the same time, BJP leader Balbir Punj had said that Owaisi's arrest is being delayed due to the collusion of Congress and MIM
 donon partiyon ke bich 'match fiks' jaisi sthiti he
 Punj said here, 'there is collusion between Congress and MIM
 akbar ovaisi ne jab bhadakaau bhaashan diya tha to unhen nishchit taur par sthaneey yaa kendriya netaaon kaa samarthan hasil rahaa hoga
 Punj said, "police going to his house, asking for his four days time is part of the drama
" unka biimaar hona bahanebaaji he
 This is part of the match fix
 sarkaar vastav main is maamle ko lekar gambhir nahin he
 'it is noteworthy that due to inflammatory speeches, cases have been registered against Owaisi in three districts of Andhra Pradesh including Hyderabad
 un par desh ke viruddh yuddh chhedane jaisaa sangeen aarope bhi lagaaya gaya he
 Karan Johar's production 'dharma Production' has released the poster of his new film 'gunjan Saxena - The Kargil Girl'
 yah film aieef kii mahila payalat gunjan saxena(gunjan Saxena) par bani he
 The film stars Janhvi Kapoor as Gunjan, while Pankaj Tripathi plays his father
 ab sawaal uthta he ki gunjan saxenakun hai (who is Gunjan Saxena) or un par film banane kii vajah kya he? gunjan saxena bhartiya vayusena main flite leftinent rah chuki hai
 44-year-old Gunjan is now retired
 unhen kargil girl ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Gunjan has been awarded the Shaurya Award for his valor, courage and patriotism
 gunjan wo mahila he jinhone danke kii chot par sabit kiya ki mahilaayein na sirf payalat ban sakati he balki jang ke maudaan main apana loha manavaa sakati he
 During the Kargil war Gunjan Saxena flew a cheetah helicopter fearlessly into the battlefield
 is dauraan vah draas or batalik kii oonchi pahadiyon se uthaakar waapas surakshit sthaan par lekar ain
 Pakistani soldiers were constantly attacking with rocket launchers and bullets
 gunjan ke aircraft par missile bhi daagi gai lekin nishaanaa chook gaya or gunjan bal-bal bachiin
 Gunjun, without any weapons, confronted the Pakistani soldiers and rescued many soldiers from there
 bataa den ki jab gunjan hansraj college se grajuation kar rahi thi tab unhone dillaa kaa safadarganj flying club jwine kar liya tha
 Both his father and brother were serving in the Indian Army at that time
 isi dauraan unhen pataa chalaa ki IAF main pehali baar mahila payalton kii bhartee kii ja rahi he
 He then passed the SSB exam and joined the Indian Air Force as a pilot
 us vakt suraksha balon main purush adhikariyon kaa varchasv tha or bhartiya vayusena main mahila adhikariyon ko purushon ke baraabar udaan bharne kaa mauka nahin diya jaataa tha
 Of course, women officers were not allowed to fly fighter jets at that time, but the women of their batch had made history by flying the aircraft for the first time in the Indian Air Force
 haalanki us vakt bhartiya vayusena main mahila payalton ke liye aarakshan tha
 But then it was not clear how they would face mental and physical stress and wars to fly? These women wanted a chance to prove their ability which they got during the Kargil war in 1999
 yuddh ke dauraan jab bhartiya sena ko payalat kii jarurat padi, tab gunjan or shri vidya ko yuddh kshetra main bheja gaya
 He also flew several times very close to the Line of Control to complete his mission so that the position of Pakistani troops could be ascertained
 vaaki gunjan ne na sirf yah sabit kiya ki vah desh kii sachhee sainik hai, balki unhone duniya ko yah bhi dikhaa diya ki mahilaayein kya kar sakati hai
 Now women pilots can also fly fighter planes in the Indian Air Force and the credit goes to the courageous IAF pilots like Gunjan Saxena
