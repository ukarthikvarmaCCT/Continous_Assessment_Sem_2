 The difficulty increases when runs are scored on the main bowlers
 maine is ummid main aswin ko aajamaaya ki vah unki ran gati par ankush lagayegaa lekin usne bhi ran lutaaye
 The first five overs were not good for us
 ’dhoni ne kaha, ‘hamaare tej gendbaaj bahut tej gend nahin karte
 Their speed is between 128 to 132 km
 yadi gend swing nahin ho rahi ho to unke liye kaam thodaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Dhoni said that he did not have a choice due to injuries

 Many important meetings, political meetings were also held at his home
 nae grih mantri kii lagbhag sabhi baithken north block main hi hoti hai
 Governor, Chief Minister, Cabinet Minister, State BJP, etc
, this is now a new address for everyone
 kai ardhsainik bal pramukh unase mil sakate hai, lekin rajya ke police pramukh abhi bhi qatari main hai
 They are told that the minister is 'busy'
 aisa hi he nishchit rup se
 They take briefings in various wings of their ministry
 19 vibhaag hai or prayek ko mantri ke liye ek prajentation taiyaar karne ke liye kaha gaya he
 It is indicative that the Home Ministry will be a big power center headed by Amit Shah
 ve aath cabinet cametiyon main hai, jabaki pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa naam chah samitiyon main he
 Rajnath Singh was named in only two committees in the first list on Thursday
 shaam ko unka naam chah samitiyon main ho gaya
 Amit Shah and Prime Minister Modi have been very close for two decades
 do aam chunaav unhone milakar jite hai
 Is Amit Shah really deputy prime minister? This topic is unknown for bureaucracy
 mantralay ke ek adhikari bataate hai ki "ve khud ko is tarah se aage badha rahe hai ki babu bhi mahatvapurn muddon ko lekar line main lage rahete hai
 Nobody wants to say no to them, or give a counter point of view
 " kuch naukarshahon kaa kahana he ki navdith kendriya mantri, jinhen bhaajapa kii avishwasaneey jeet kaa shrey diya jaataa he, modi yug 2 ke ubharate hue sitare hai
 There is also a fact that Amit Shah is also among those committees who have no connection with the Ministry of Home Affairs
 ek nai cameti, jo ki rojgaar or aarthik vruddhi ke liye he, main unka hona spasht udhaaharan he
 It is a sign of their importance in government
 ek adhikari ne kaha ki rajnath singh ko number do mantri ke rup main mana ja rahaa he, lekin inamen se adhikansh samitiyaan shah ke mahatv ko kam nahin karti hai
 National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval's role in the new government is like fuel for PM Modi
 ek anya adhikari ne kaha ki "aantarik suraksha ke maamalon main, pehle enese ke aadesh se karrwai hoti thi
 But Amit Shah cannot discount any bureaucrat
 "cabinet cameti on security ek or vishay he jiske bare main power coridor main sabase zyada charchaa kii jane vaali he
 Its role is very important, because in the Modi government 2, the focus is on national security
 iske panel main hameshaa sarkaar ke sheersh chaar log shaamil hote hai, or nae videsh mantri es jaishankar iskaa ek hissaa hai
 Doval has been promoted to cabinet rank
 adhikariyon kaa anumaan he, unhen keval jaishankar kii barabari par laana tha, kyonki yah mahasoos kiya gaya tha ki donon ke bich nirantar tulana kii jaaegi
 The government official clarified that in the previous government, Jaishankar used to attend the meetings of Doval but now he is in the Cabinet Committee (CCS), a very high jump

 Within 3 weeks of Rajinikanth's announcement to enter politics, its effect has started showing
 india today-karvi incits opinian pole main aaj chunaav karaae jane kii sthiti main rajnikant ko bada phayda miltaa dikh rahaa he
 Tamil cinema's superstar Rajinikanth announced his arrival in politics on the last day of 2017, putting an end to long speculations
 tamilnadu main purv mukhyamantri jayalalita ke nidhan or em karunanidhi ke 90 paar jane ke kaaran vahaan kii raajnneeti main netritv ko lekar shunya jaisi sthiti paidaa ho gai thi
 After the demise of Jayalalithaa on 5 December 2016, the ruling AIADMK had to face frequent infighting at the top level and the feud was openly on the road
 3 hafte main hi bane duusari pasandaisi sthiti main khud ke liye phayda dekhte hue filmi duniya ke 2 diggajon ne pichley saal raajnneeti main entry kaa faisla lekar yahaan kii siyasat main filmi viraasat kii parampara ko kaayam rakhane kii koshish kii
 Legendary film star Kamal Haasan entered politics after much consideration, earlier it was being said that he would join the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), but now he is going to form the party himself
 apni nai party kaa elaan 21 farvari ko karenge
 After his announcement, Rajinikanth also announced to try his luck in politics
 india today-karvi incits kii ore se jo opinian pole aae hai, uske mutabik aaj tamilnadu main chunaav hone kii surat main rajya kii 234 sadasyeey vidhansabha main AIADMK ke haath main mahaj 68 seat hi haath lagengi
 Whereas in the 2016 election it had got 135 seats
 jabaki rajya main mukhya vipakshi party dravid munnetra kadgam (DMK) apane congress or indian union muslim lig (IUML) sahyogiyon ke saath satta main vaapasi karti dikh rahi he
 According to opinion polls, the DMK alliance can form the government with 130 seats
 DMK gathbandhan ko 34% vot mil sakate hai
 In 2016, DMK won 88 seats on its own
 duusari ore, dekha jaae to rajnikant ne abhi raajnneeti main aane kaa elaanbhar kiya he, abhi na unhone koi party banaai he or na hi koi thos shuruyaat kii he, baavjood iske unhen 33 siton par jeetta hua dekha ja rahaa he
 If all goes well, the next assembly elections in the state will be held in 2021, so now there is at least 3 years for Rajinikanth
 unki lokapriyata or vartmaan main rajya main kamjor netritv dekhakar lagata he ki in 3 saalon main vah tamil raajnneeti main apni majboot pakad bana lenge
 Who will get the challenge? Who will be the biggest challenge for Rajinikanth in Tamil politics to hold the chief minister's post in his first stakes
 openian pole bataata he ki DMK gathbandhan satta main laut rahi he, to aisi sthiti main party ke kaaryakari adhyaksh emke stallin mukhyamantri pad ke liye bade daavedaar honge
 At the same time, if elections are held today, more than half of the participants in the opinion poll said that DMK leader MK Stalin was the first choice for the Chief Minister
 is maamle main rajnikant duusare number par rahe
 Rajinikanth was cited by 17 per cent as his first choice as chief minister
 40 fisadi logon ne mana ki vah tamil raajnneeti main ai shoonyata ko bhar sakate hai
 Stalin leads Rajinikanth with a huge margin in terms of support
 yahaan AIADMK netaaon kii sambhaavnaaen kaaphi dhoomil hai
 He is trailing Rajinikanth in the race for contenders for CM
 AIADMK main sheersh ke liye sangharsh jarijayalalita ke jane ke baad AIADMK main unki viraasat ko lekar kadaa sangharsh chal rahaa he, unka uttaradhikari koun hoga, isko lekar jamkar sangharsh chal rahaa he
 According to opinion poll, o Panneerselvam has some edge over E
 Palaniswami
 haalanki pole main shaamil 30% pratibhaagiyon kaa maananaa he ki panniraselvam, palanisvami yaa titivi dinaakaran, deepa jayakumar or shashikala natarajan main se koi bhi jayalalita kii viraasat ko sanbhaalane yogya nahin hai
 Rajinikanth may face a challenge from MK Stalin and newcomer Kamal Haasan in politics to become chief minister
 hasan ko lekar sthiti abhi saaf nahin he
 Haasan is now about to announce the party, while Rajinikanth has started making his party cadre
 tamil kii raajnneeti dilachasp hone vaali he
 In the poll, 29 per cent people said that Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan should field together
 jabaki 31 fisadi log iske khilaaf he
 23 per cent believed that they would be against each other
 53 fisadi loga maanate hai ki vah raajnneeti kii duniya main bhi kaamyaab rahenge
 On the other hand, about 26 percent of Kamal believed that he would prove effective in Tamil politics
 pole main 48 fisadi log maanate hai ki tamil kii raajnneeti main ek baar phir se filmi sitaron kaa jalawaa hoga
 Right now, time will tell when and who will become the next Chief Minister from the film world after Jayalalithaa in Tamil politics

 In the recent Lok Sabha elections, the bjp's popularity in the Dalit vote bank, which is considered a traditional voter of the BSP, has increased
 dow
 On the birth anniversary and death anniversary of Ambedkar, many organizations associated with the Sangh including BJP organize events
 aise main bijepi ne bispi ke sansthaapak kanshiram ko bhi puraa sammaan dene kaa nishchay kiya he
 Along with this, it has been decided to organize events on the birth anniversary and death anniversary of all the great men on whom BSP still considers their copyright
 kanshiram ke alaava bijepi kii suchi main narayan guru, jyotiba foole or chhatrapati shahu ji mahraaj shaamil hai
 The Sangh Parivar is excited by the support the BJP received from the Scheduled Castes in the Lok Sabha elections
 use is baat kaa ehsaas he ki loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ummidavaaron kii sabhi surakshit 17 siton par jeet or anya sthanon par bhi anusuchit jati ke voton ke samarthan ne hi itani baari jaati dilaai he

 jaahir he aise main na sirf bijepi balki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh bhi is brihad hindu ekajutata ko banaae rakhane ke liye sakriy ho gaya he
 It is aware that the scattering of these castes will weaken its position, while the linkage will strengthen the BJP in the 2017 UP Assembly elections

 An official of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) told India Today, "it is difficult to find out whether Nirav Modi actually sold the diamonds to these people as he has not been questioned yet
" 'un sabhi logon ko notice bheja gaya he jinhone pan card kii jaankaree nahin di he yaa kaale dhan kaa istemaal kiya he
 Therefore, notices are being sent to them, but this is not going to produce any significant results

 Former Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar while addressing a public meeting at Malshiras in Solapur district said that the ruling party has become yellow, but they still say that the debt waiver list was not ready
 vah itane par hi nahin ruke
 He further said that when there has been a lot of rain, the water of the Ujni dam would have been filled in the ponds built in the fields of the farmers, but the government did not provide water
 agar diya hota to inke dot dot dot kaa kya jaataa? pavaar malshiras main prachaar sabha ke dauraan sattadhari gathbandhan (bhartiya janata party or shivasena) par jamkar barase
 He said that this government is taking 3-3 years to waive the debt of farmers
 inke chachaa ne kiya tha kya kabhi aisa kaam
 Pawar alleged that the BJP and Shiv Sena government took only time
 kabhi pili suchi, kabhi hari suchi to kabhi laal suchi, aise alag alag bahaane banaae hai
 This government became yellow, but it has not been built yet
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki pichley paanch saal main 16000 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he or yepaap bhi maujuuda sarkaarka he
 The farmers are neither getting the right price for the grain nor the vegetables or fruits
 pavaar ne kaha ki is sarkaar ke mantriyon ko kheti ke bare gyaan nahin he, fasalon kii bimaariyaan kya hoti hai, inhen isaki bhi jaankaree nahin he to madad kaise karenge
 Accusing the BJP and the Shiv Sena of power, the scam said that lakhs of rupees were duped from farmers in Western Maharashtra in the name of business of hard-nosed chickens

 He said that the leaders of BJP and Shiv Sena have got intoxicated with power, arrogance of power
 sattadhari ye bhul gaye ki jasejanata netaaon ko chunakartaj pahanaati he, vaise hi dhul bhi chataa detii he
 The BJP mp's statement criticized Ajit Pawar during the election campaign for the alleged statement of BJP MP from Ahmednagar Sujay Vikhe Patil, in which Vikhe had asked farmers to press the lotus button or return two thousand rupees received in the government scheme

 2 earthquake hits Turkey, devastation in Van and Irakis cities of eastern province, death of around 100, fear of crossing 1000, relief work going on 'big bos 12 (bigg Boss 12)' ke paanch finlist tay ho gaye hai, or surabhi rana kaa big bos main safar khatm ho gaya he
 Surbhi Rana hit a wild card entry in Bigg Boss, and came home with Romil Chaudhary
 surabhi rana ne ghar main aate hi dhamal kaat diya tha, or apni bahut hi negative image bhi banaai thi
 But Surabhi Rana became captain at home five times
 surabhi rana kii srisanth ke jamkar fite hui thi, or donon ne ek duusare ko kai baar apshabd bhi kahe the
 But today, in the 'bigg Boss 12' midweek aviation, Surabhi Rana's journey ended at home
 Woah! Finale week tak pahunchkar ab eviction ka shikaar hui # surbhirana aur kaha unhone iss safar ko alvida

 com / qt7qecodjf In 'bigg Boss 12', Surabhi Rana made headlines due to her aggressiveness
 haalanki pichley kuch dinon se ve bahut hi shant tevar apanaae hue hai
 Sreesanth has also targeted him for his quiet attitude
 surabhi ne ghar ke sadasyon ko uksaane kaa bhi bahut kaam kiya or har task main ve bahut aakraamak ho jaati thim
 After all, today his journey to the Big Boss house is over and for him it is nothing short of a shock

 @colorstv @endemolshineind @ viacom18 @voot @beingsalmankhana post shared by Surbhi Rana (@surbhirana_official) on Dec 24, 2018 at 10:59 pm PST 'bigg Boss 12' now has only five finalists due to Surabhi Rana's departure Have survived
 ab muqabla deepika kakkad, deepak thakur, romil choudhary, karanvir bohara or srisanth ke bich he
 In this way, the game has become even more interesting, but Sreesanth's fan following is tremendous and now his chances of winning have increased considerably
 lekin surabhi rana kaa safar khatm hone se yah baat sabit ho gai he ki ghar main aakraamak tevar unke liye mahange pade or srisanth ke kai baar madad karne ke baad bhi unka ravaiya sahi nahin rahaa
 The problems of the Indian cricket team, which is suffering from injuries, may increase further, because now opener Gautam Gambhir may also have to return home
 pichley 10 din main gambhir ke sir main lagi chot main adhik sudhaar nahin hua he
 It will be a big shock for the World Champion team as players like Zaheer Khan, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh and Virender Singh have already returned home due to injuries after joining the team
 bharat ne test shrinkhalaa main 0-4 ke whitewash ke saath england ko duniya kii number ek test team kii ranking bhi ganvaa di thi or ab teen sitambar se chester lee street main shuru ho rahi vanade shrinkhalaa main bhi uske saamne isi tarah kii haar se bachane kii chunauti he
 On the second day of the final Test at The Oval, on August 19, at mid-on, Kevin Pietersen had a serious back-and-forth injury when he caught a catch and injured his head, after which he was fainting
 gambhir ne iske baad antim test kii donon kii pariyon main nichle kram main ballebaaji kii or adhik ran nahin banaaye
 Doctors also performed an MRI scan of Gambhir thereafter, but the condition of this batsman is not improving, despite the fact that there is no problem in it
 gambhir kaa maamla bhi dakshin africa ke tej gendbaaj del sten kii tarah lagata he jo pichley saal champions lig ke dauraan chennai superkings or royal chalangers bangalore ke bich semifinal mukaable ke dauraan maaikel hasi kaa kaich lapakane kii koshish main peeche kii ore daudte hue gir pade the
 He suffered a head injury and despite the MRI report coming true, it took the fast bowler three to four weeks to return to his ideal position
 aisa lagata he ki gambhir kii chot bhi isi tarah kii he or vah bhi teen se chaar hafte tak cricket nahin khel paaenge

 The 'council for the Indian School Certificate Examination' (CISCE) said on Monday that it waited for the cbse's decision regarding the moderation policy before announcing its exam results
 siaiessii isiesai or aiessi parikshaayen leti he
 Last year ICSE (10th grade) and ISC (12th standard) results were declared on 6 May
 haalanki, paanch rajyon - punjab, upra, manipur, uttarakhand or goa - main chunaavon ko lekar siaiessii ne pariksha kaarykram main kuch der kii
 Council CEO Gerry Arathoon said, 'we first waited for the Delhi High Court verdict and then the cbse's stand on the issue as the principle decision to cancel the moderation policy was made by 32 boards from Amarai,' the council said today
 And announced the 12th class exam results

 After considering the move of the Supreme Court, the CBSE decided against it as the process would have delayed the declaration of results
 gauratlab he ki kal maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne spasht rup se kaha tha ki mantralay is vishay main hastkshep nahin karegaa or is mudde par academik faisla karnaa boderein par nirbhar he
 However, CISCE delayed the examination schedule in five states - Punjab, UP, Manipur, Uttarakhand and Goa - over the elections
 parishad ke siio geri arathun ne kaha, ' hamane pehle dilli ucch nyaayalay ke faisle or phir is mudde par sibiesai ke ruukh kaa intjaar kiya kyonki moderation niti ko radd karne kaa saidhantik faisla 32 boderein ne amrai se kiya tha,' parishad ne aaj 10 veen or 12 veen kaksha ke pariksha parinaamon kii ghoshnaa kii
 The CBSE Class 12 result was announced yesterday

 ucchtam nyaayalay kaa ruukh karne kaa vichaar karne ke baad sibiesai ne iske khilaaf faisla kiya kyonki is prakriya se parinaamon kii ghoshnaa main or der ho jaati
 It is worth noting that yesterday, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar had clearly stated that the Ministry will not interfere in this matter and it is up to the boards to take academic decisions on this issue

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne swatantraaa diwas ke apane abhibhaashan se thik pehle, raat do baje jab laal kile ke manch se bulatopruf fibre glass ko hataane ke nirdesh die, to maamla sirf pratikatmak nahin tha
 In his extraordinary election campaign, Modi used local heroes, dialects and shared concerns to establish a comfortable and immediate relationship with the people
 unhone matadaataaon se sidhe kaha thah mujhe vot dijie or main nattejey duungaa
 It has been ninety days to the new government and the country that won Modi with a huge vote has not lost its patience and faith so far
 modi ke gaddinshin hone ke baad pehali baar, india today samooh-hansaa research ke desh kaa mizaaj jaanane ke liye janamat surveykshan main 57 fisadi log maanate hai ki ve hi pradhanmantri banane ke liye sabase upyukt hai, 48 fisadi logon kaa maananaa he ki unhone mantriyon ko apraasangik bana diya he jabaki 47 fisadi log is baat se aashwast hai ki ve aresas ke agenda ko rokane main sakasham honge
 Voters, bored with the functioning of the two poles of power during the UPA tenure, now want the center of both power and accountability to be the same
 agar dobaaraa chunaav hue, to 48 fisadi logon kaa kahana he ki ve phir bijepi ko vot denge
 This figure may be huge but it is much lower than Modi's personal popularity
 aaj chunaav hue to bijepi ko 16 may ko aae nateezon se 32 siten zyada milengi yani kul 314 siten milengi
 Modi used to aspire to rule the country
 ve logon kii bhaawanaaon par bhi raaj karne kii kaabiliyat rakhte hai
 He has reached out to communities from which he has had uneasy relationships with his impartial perspective
 chaahe vah sansad main unka abhibhaashan ho athwa swatantraaa diwas kaa bhaavana pradhan sambodhan, donon se yahi baat sabit hoti he
 78% of people feel safe in the shadow of the Modi government
 68 fisadi musalmaan bhi yahi raay rakhte hai
 Surprisingly, in the survey, more Muslims are asking to vote for BJP this time (29 per cent) while in the case of Congress this figure is just 24 per cent
 isse bhi chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki modi khud desh kii bhaawanaaon ke saath kadamtal karte najar aa rahe hai jo shaayad unki feedback ke tareekon kaa hi nateeja he
 According to an India Today group-hansa Research poll, 69 percent believe textbooks should change, 43 percent do not want foreign direct investment in the retail business, and 41 percent believe that criminal prosecution in the case of comments on Facebook Filing is not an encroachment of freedom of expression
 bijepi kii baari jeet se utsahit yah desh ab bhi is ummid or intjaar main he ki achche din jarur aaenge
 49 per cent of the people surveyed believe that their economic condition will improve in future and 65 per cent believe that the Modi government will put the country's economy back on track in the next six months
 surveykshan main logon kaa kahana he ki ve sansad main majboot vipaksh kii kaamana karte hai or unhen congress se is bhoomika ke nibhaae jane kii ummid he
 This trend is a strong indicator of mature democracy
 bharat ko ek netaa to chahie lekin aisa nahin jo nirvirodh ho
 The voters of the country are liberal
 ve rahul gandhi ko ek or mauka dena chaahate hai or ve rahul ko unki bahan priyanka va unki maa sonia par tarjeeh dete hai
 They believe that only the Gandhi family can give the Congress a competent leader
 yah is baat kaa sandesh he ki rahul ko sakriy rahanaa chahie or lagaataar apni sakriyata banaae rakhni chahie
 Expressing anger over communal violence in Parliament on any one day and becoming silent again the next day does not suit anyone who has to stand against Modi
 vakt haalanki bitta ja rahaa he
 In the survey, people are seen giving Modi six months time
 ve nahin chaahate ki desh ke amuly sansaadhan sardaar patel kii pratimaa jaise pratikatmak kaamon par kharch hon
 67 per cent of the people surveyed say that they are unable to earn according to rising inflation
 is dauraan modi ne ek zyada javabdeh sarkaar kaa mujahiraa kiya he jo lambey samay tak or zyada mehnat se kaam kar rahi he
 The power brokers walking in Delhi's shiny rooms and five-star hotels have been shown the way out of power
 ab tak ek bhi ghotaale kii bhanak nahin lag saki he—yahaan tak ki 70,000 rupye kii maamuli rakam ke maamle main bhi javabdehi dekhne ko mil rahi he jaisaa ki hamane kendriya film pramann board ke siio ke kathith rishwat cond main dekha he
 Government initiatives on public services have reached the homes of the people
 do korporate ne shauchalay nirmaan ke liye 100-100 karod kharch karne kaa vaada kar daalaa he
 Modi, his government will affect everyone in one way or the other
 i-gavarnence, i-shikshan, i-commers or telemedicine jaisi pahal se naukarshahon or janata ke bich kii duuri khatm hogi or rishwatakhori tathaa dhilaai samaapt hogi
 Will all this be enough? As revealed in the survey, people want better public services but they are not willing to pay for them
 vidambnaaen or bhi hai, masalan udaarikaran main jawan hui peedi real estate ke alaava bank ke epady main ab bhi nivesh kyon karnaa chaahati he? yaa phir, jab ve netaaon ko bhrasht maanate hai, to surveykshan main shaamil har chaar main se ek vyakti ne rishwat kyon di he? arthshaastri bibek debaroy kehete hai, 1991 ke baad vibhinn sarkaron ke dauraan aarthik morche par badlaav kii gati dhimi rahi he to isliye ki janata bhi puri tarah badlaav nahin chaahati
 Therefore, both Modi and the people of the country will have to take care of each other's talk
 aisa karne ke liye abhi kam se kam paanch saal kaa vakt to he hi

 With this, the future of the Pakistani citizen, who was the main terrorist of the Mumbai terror attack, has now come in the hands of the central government

 Sangma's tribal card did not work, but on the basis of this, he is trying to increase his activism in the politics of tribal dominated state of Chhattisgarh
 mauka bhi unhone khub chunaa he
 The tribal class is disappointed with the BJP because the Bilaspur High Court has stayed the state government's decision to increase tribal reservation from 28 to 32 per cent, while the class has already been disenchanted with the Congress
 aise main is tabake ko adivasee samudaay se hi taalluk rakhane vaale sangama se kuch aashaa najar aa rahi he
 Sangma arrived at a conference held in Raipur on World Tribal Day on August 9
 yahaan unhone adivasee party banane kaa bhi elaan kar diya
 Here he describes his firm intention to make inroads in tribal politics, "I thought of becoming the tribal president from Chhattisgarh
" yahaan ke adivasee netaa majboot janaadhar vaale hai lekin unhen jaan-bujhkar netritv nahin saunpa gaya he
 "in the last one month, Sangma has done more than five visits to Chhattisgarh
" pradesh main unki ati sakriyata se donon pramukh partiyon me khalabali much gai he
 Actually, tribal votes are very important in state politics
 chhattisgarh vidhansabha kii 90 me se 27 siten adivaasiyon ke liye arakshit hai
 When the state government increased the reservation of tribals in government jobs to 32 per cent and that of Dalits to 14 per cent, the Dalit community fell out of the state government
 udhar adivasee aarakshan badhaane par lagi roak se adivaasiyon kaa asantosh bhi saamne aa gaya
 Sarva Adivasi Samaj, an organization of former tribal leader of Congress Arvind Netam, woke up the Congress and BJP by organizing dharna and demonstrations across the state demanding implementation of enhanced reservation
 idhar, pradesh sarkaar se rajya ke adivasee samudaay ke adhikari bhi naaraaz chal rahe hai kyonki rajya ke mukhya sachiv pad ke liye sabase varisht adhikari the narayan singh, jo adivasee samudaay se taalluk rakhte hai
 But bypassing his claim Sunil Kumar Kurup, who was once Ajit Jogi's secretary, was made the chief secretary
 adivasee samudaay ko ummid bandhi thi ki bhale hi koi adivasee pradesh kaa mukhyamantri na bana ho lekin samudaay kaa vyakti mukhya sachiv jarur banegaa
 His hope also broke
 ab sangama adivasee varg ko adivasee mukhyamantri dene kaa vaada kar rahe hai
 They ask, "if a tribal forms its own party, what is the harm in this? The political consciousness of the tribal class of the state has awakened
 '' sangama ko pradesh ke adivasee netaaon kaa bharpoor samarthan mil rahaa he
 Says Netam, "the Congress and the BJP talked big about getting the rights of the tribals but they didn't really do anything for it
 adivasee mukhyamantri chhattisgarh main nahin to phir or kahaan banegaa?'' to bijepi ke adivasee netaa or rajyasabha sadsy nandkumar saay kehete hai, ''sangama aane vaale dinon main desh ke bade adivasee netaa ke rup main ubharenge
 He has also worked hard to unite the tribes of India
 ''agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ko dekhte hue adivasee samaaj ko lubhaane main jutin congress or bijepi sangama ke dakhal par najar to rakhe hue hai lekin unhen zyada tavajjo bhi nahin dena chaahati hai
 State Congress President Nand Kumar Patel says, "sangma did nothing for the tribals
 isliye raashtrapati chunaav main unhen munh kii khaani padi
 "so BJP state president Ram Sewak Packra says," We have a strong base among the tribal community
 sangama kii party kaa raajnneetik vajood najar nahin aata
 "by the way, these parties know that a camel can sit on any side

 Two contestants walked out on Tuesday in Colors Channel's reality show Bigg Boss

 On this, his good friend and actor-model Gauhar Khan also walked out of Bigg Boss house

 The members of the house were told that if Andy harassed them, the other members would not pay attention to them
 task ke dauraan, endi ne gauhar kii lingeri ko lekar kuch tippaniyan kii
 As a result, Andy gets angry with Gauhar and says that these things are very cheap and not acceptable at all
 gauhar ne yah bhi kaha ki ve endi ko acha dost maanati thim or is tarah ke bartaav kii ummid nahin karti thim
 Kushal also gets angry
 kushal bekaabu ho jaataa he or endi kii ore use maarane ko daudta he
 The rest of the house members stop Kushal and everyone tries to calm his anger
 kushal endi ke saath gaali-galoch karata rahata he
 When the situation is out of control, Bigg Boss asks all the contestants to gather in the living room and, seeing Kushal's violent attitude, asks him to immediately pack his bag
 gauhar ne apane dost kaa saath dete hue faisla liya ki ve bhi unke saath hi jaaengi
 Everybody tries to convince them, but to no avail
 kuch der baad gauhar or kushal ghar se chalate banate hai
 Now the thing to be noted is how the Colors channel shows the departure of these two popular contestants in the show and how to compensate for their TRP

 Suppose you are a conscious voter
 har chunaav main aapaki shekhi ye hoti he ki aapane bade bado ko haraa diya, sarkarein badal deen
 To take advantage of these experiences from you, we want to ask a question
 maan lijie aap is baar sattadhari krantikari dal se naaraaz hai or uski jagah badlaav dal ko vot karnaa chaahate hai

 Your favorite leader now stands from the party you did not want to vote for
 jis party ko aap vot dena chaahate hai vahaan se wo ummidavaar he jise aap haraana chaahate hai
 You tell who you will vote for
 sahi party ko chunenge yaa sahi ummidavaar ko
 To choose the right party, you have to vote for the change party, to choose the right candidate you have to vote for the revolutionary party
 jawaab aap par chodta hum
 Knowing that voting is not an easy decision
 kya ye ajeeb nahin he ki aap jis dal ko jitaana chaahate hai, uske liye din raat mehnat karne vaale kaaryakartaaon ke prati aapaki koi sahanubhuti nahin he
 You vote for a candidate from another party
 har dal main dalbadal branch he
 Both the party and the defectors are opportunistic
 yah bhi sahi he ki tikat bantane ke do-teen din tak hi dalbadalu or parivaarwaad kaa mudda haaavee rahata he

 Dainik Bhaskar has written that BJP has so far given tickets to 30 defectors out of 300 candidates

 Based on the names of the wives, sons and daughters-in-law of mps and leaders, the names of families within the BJP are as follows: Brij Bhushan family, Sarvesh family, Kaushal Kishore family, Maurya family, Tandon family, Hukum family, Rahi family, Katiyar family, Shastri Family, Vajpayee Family, Tripathi Family, Gangwar Family, Chulbul Singh Family, Srivastava Family, Rai Family, Kapoor Family
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki basapa, congress or sapa main parivaarwaad band ho gaya he
 No family of Mulayam Singh Kunbe can compete in UP
 mulaayam singh yadav ke kunbe kii list itani lambii hoti ja rahi he ki ek din is parivaar se upi ko teen chaar dal to milenge hi
 Two new versions of the Yadav family have also been launched in this election
 ramgopal yadav ke bhaanje arvind singh yadav ko kannauj kii chhibramau seat se tikat mila he
 Aparna Yadav, wife of Prateek Yadav, who owned a Ferrari car, got a ticket from Lucknow Cantt
 iske alaava sapa main aazam parivaar, agarwal parivaar, ansaari parivaar jaise kai parivaar hai
 The Congress has distributed many tickets in Punjab on the basis of familyism
 balki captain amarinder singh ne parivaarwaad ke naam par tikat kii maang ko dekhte hue 'ek parivaar ek tikat' kaa ajooba niyam nikaala
 Based on media reports, the Congress has given 13 tickets on the basis of familism
 har dal ne parivaarwaad ke aadhaar par tikat diye hai, magar is tarah ke cote kaa shrey captain sahab ko hi janaa chahie
 The Congress has not made such a rule for Goa and UP
 goa main congress ne baap-bete ko tikat diya he
 Have given ticket to husband and wife
 basapa main bhi parivaarwaad ke aadhaar par tikat mili hai
 The comments ab matadaata ko tay karnaa he ki wo chunaav main sarkaar chune yaa ummidavaar chune
 While choosing a candidate, treat the family-change, familism also
 vaise matadaata kaa kaam ummidavaar chunanaa hota he, sarkaar chunanaa uskaa kaam nahin he
 You voters will be able to tell who is stopping more talent within politics and political party
 paisa yaa parivaarwaad
 According to ADR data, the average wealth of millionaire mps in the Lok Sabha is said to be 14 crores
 paise vaale raajnneeti main aaenge to chunaav mahange hi hote jaayenge
 In this process, the chance for new talent is reduced
 raajnneeti pariwaron ke aas paas gumti rahati he
 You can change the party but you cannot change the family
 party ke saath-saath paisa or parivaar bhi package main judaa hota he Indian politics is becoming artificial
 thode bahut antaron ke saath har dal kaa ek sa hi pattern dikhataa he
 Look at the dilemma of journalists
 pehle ve dada ji ko cover karte the, phir unke bete yaa beti ko cover karne lage, ab naati poton ko cover karnaa pad rahaa he or kar bhi rahe hai
 New talent is rarely seen in politics for writing and speaking
 jawaab aap par chodta hum
 Knowing that voting is not an easy decision
 kya ye ajeeb nahin he ki aap jis dal ko jitaana chaahate hai, uske liye din raat mehnat karne vaale kaaryakartaaon ke prati aapaki koi sahanubhuti nahin he
 You vote for a candidate from another party
 har dal main dalbadal branch he
 Both the party and the defectors are opportunistic
 yah bhi sahi he ki tikat bantane ke do-teen din tak hi dalbadalu or parivaarwaad kaa mudda haaavee rahata he
 After that rallies start, the whole scene becomes something else
 dalbadal or parivaarwaad kaa mudda samaapt ho jaataa he
 Then the next election emerges
 ghaziabad zile main vidhansabha kii paanch site hai

 congress ne bhi ek dalbadalu ko tikat diya he
 The BSP has not given tickets to any defectors
 hapur zile main vidhansabha kii teen siten hai

 sapa ne 6 seat par naamon kii ghoshnaa kar di he magar kisi dalbadalu ko tikat nahin diya he
 The BJP has announced a single seat, not given it to the defectors
 hallaa hangaamaa se lagata he ki saare dalon ne mul kaaryakartaaon kii andekhi kii he or bahari ko hi tikat diya he
 But going to the district, it seems that everyone is here, defected
 kisi zile main kam hai yaa kisi kisi main bahut zyaada
 Dainik Bhaskar has written that BJP has so far given tickets to 30 defectors out of 300 candidates
 ek doosraa masalaa he parivaarwaad
 This time many families in BJP got tickets, then the familyism within the Congress, SP and BSP escaped from the public eye
 bijepi zarur parivaarwaad kaa virodh karti he, lekin ab uske netaa gandhi parivaarwaad or apane yahaan ke pita-putron kii raajnneeti ke parivaarwaad se fark kar rahe hai
 Randeep Surjewala of the Congress did not respond

 congress ke randeep surajevaala ne jawaab nahin diya
 He is himself the son of a politician
 bijepi ke om maathur ne jawaab diya ki wo gandhiparivaar ke vanshavaad or bhaajapa ke bheetar ke nae nae pariwaron main fark karte hai
 What he means is that the Gandhi family in the Congress only sits on the upper chair
 bijepi main parivaar ke sadsy ko kaaryakarta se upar kii ore chadhana padataa he
 Have to work in the organization
 hamane kuch din pehle upi bijepi ke bheetar parivaarwaad kii ginati kii thi
 Many names have been added to it
 bijepi ke bheetar kalyaan parivaar sapa parivaar kaa muqabla karata lag rahaa he
 Kalyan Singh is the Governor
 unke bete bijepi se saansad hai
 Son's son got assembly ticket
 bahu ko bhi tikat mila he
 The Rajnath family has come into the race with Pankaj Singh getting the ticket
 saansadon or netaaon kii patniyon, beton or bahu ke naam ke aadhaar par bhaajapa ke bheetar ke pariwaron ke naam is prakaar hai brijabhooshan parivaar, sarvesh parivaar, kaushal kishor parivaar, maury parivaar, tandon parivaar, hukum parivaar, raahi parivaar, katiyaar parivaar, shastri parivaar, vaajapeyi parivaar, treepathi parivaar, gangavar parivaar, chulbul singh parivaar, shrivastav parivaar, raay parivaar, kapur parivaar
 This does not mean that familyism has stopped in BSP, Congress and SP
 upi main mulaayam singh kunbe kaa koi parivaar muqabla nahin kar saktaa he
 The list of Mulayam Singh Yadav's clan is becoming so long that one day UP will get four teams from this family
 is chunaav main bhi yadav parivaar ke do nae sanskaran launch hue hai
 Ramgopal Yadav's nephew Arvind Singh Yadav has got the ticket from Chibramau seat of Kannauj
 pheraari car vaale pratik yadav kii patni aparnaa yadav ko lakhanu kaint se tikat mila he
 Apart from this, SP has many families like Azam family, Agarwal family, Ansari family
 congress ne punjab main kai tikat parivaarwaad ke aadhaar par baante hai
 Rather, Captain Amarinder Singh, in view of the demand for tickets in the name of familism, drew a unique rule of 'one family one ticket'
 media report ke aadhaar par congress ne parivaarwaad ke aadhaar par 13 tikat diye hai
 Every party has given tickets on the basis of familyism, but the credit for such quota should go to Captain Saheb
 goa or upi ke liye congress ne aisa niyam nahin banaaya he
 In Goa, the Congress has given the father-son ticket
 pati-patni ko tikat diya he
 BSP has also got tickets on the basis of familyism
 tippaniyan Now the voter has to decide whether to elect a government or a candidate in the election
 ummidavaar chunate vakt dal-badal, parivaarwaad kaa bhi ilaaj kare
 Although the job of a voter is to choose a candidate, it is not his job to choose a government
 aap matadaata hi bataa sakenge ki raajnneeti or raajnneetik dal ke bheetar pratibhaaon ko koun zyaada roak rahaa he
 Money or Familyism
 ediaar ke aankade ke anusaar loksabhaa main karodpati saansadon kii ausat sampatti 14 karod bataai jaati he
 If people with money enter politics, elections will only get expensive
 is prakriya main nai pratibhaaon ke liye chance kam rah jaataa he
 Politics revolves around families
 aap party to badal sakate hai magar parivaar nahin badal sakate
 Along with the party, money and family are also included in the package

 You would know that Facebook had bought whatsapp and now it is Facebook's company
 khabar he ki watsap ke ko-founder jine kum fasebuk se aantarik jhagade or data privesi ko lekar company chhod rahe hai
 According to a report by the Washington Post, he has taken a decision on whatsapp's messaging strategy with parent company Facebook, due to which he has taken this decision
 washington post ne company ke aantarik baatcheet ke jaankaro ke hawaale se kaha he ki fasebuk yugers ke personal data ko istemaal karnaa chahta he or watsap ke ancripshan ko kamjor karnaa chahta he jo watsap ke ko founder ko nagavar gujara he
 Significantly, in 2014, Jane sold her company whatsapp from Facebook for $ 19 billion
 iske baad wo apni company ke saath fasebuk kaa hissaa ban gaye the or fasebuk ke board of diarector main bhi shaamil ho gaye the
 But now it is being told that he has also decided to separate himself from Facebook's board of directors
 haalanki abhi tak ye saaf nahin he ki wo fasebuk kab chhod rahe hai yani taarikh kaa pataa nahin he
 Jane Kume has not yet clarified why he is leaving Facebook
 kyonki unhone fasebuk post main aisa kuch bhi zikr nahin kiya he
 Jane wrote in a Facebook post, 'almost decades have passed since Brian and i started whatsapp together and the journey has been great
 lekin ab aage samay aage badhane kaa he
 'they have said,' i am leaving whatsapp at a time when so many people are using whatsapp, which i did not even expect
 team pehle se majboot he or yah aage bhi behatar kaam karti rahegi’kul mila dekha jaae to jin do shaks ne milakar watsap ko banaaya tha ab wo watsap se alag ho chuke hai
 Brian Acton has already appealed to the people to delete Facebook and now whatsapp's second founder, Jane Koom, has also left Facebook
 in donon founders ne jab watsap ko fasebuk ke haathon bechaa tha tab unhone ye vaada kiya tha ki yugers data kii raksha karnaa unki mukhya jimmedaari rahegi
 It was also improved by bringing end to end encryption in 2016, but then the news came that whatsapp data would go to Facebook and it would be used by it
 iske baad ab cambridge analitica maamla aayaa or shaayad in vajahon se hi anban kii shuruyaat hui he jaisaa reports main bhi kaha ja rahaa he
 Now the question is what will happen to user security on whatsapp
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki ab mark jakarberg ise apane tareeke se chalaayenge or sambhav he ki watsap kaa ab zyada yujar data fasebuk ke saath share kiya ja saktaa he
 However, bjp's central leaders do not believe that Drabu's dismissal will break the alliance as it is an internal matter of PDP

 Kamal Haasan said in another tweet that he aims to create a better Tamil Nadu

 If the parties do not get help, they will find another way
 'my aim is a better Tamilnadu
