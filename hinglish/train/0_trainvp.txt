 This is a terrible situation because about 20 lakh people of this area depend on the water of these dams
 marathavada main aath jile hai or in sabhi ke jal nikaayon main philhal sirf 31
 2 percent water is left
 pichley saal is samay isse kahin zyada 82
 Water was up to 2 percent
 is saal marathavada main anumaan se 29 fisadi kam barish hui he, par visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki yah sankat, pani kii kami ke kaaran nahin paidaa hua
 In 2017, the monsoon was good and there was a lot of rain, with all three dams, including Jayakwadi, having 100 percent water of their capacity
 unka kahana he ki pani kii is uplabdh maatra se ilaake main ausat yaa kam barish hone par bhi agle teen saal ke liye pine, sinchai or audyogic jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye paryaapt pani hona chahie tha
 But these reservoirs have dried up due to indiscriminate release of water for sugarcane cultivation and alcohol production
 aurangabad main 200 sharaab factriyaan hai jo baari maatra main pine ke pani kaa upyog karti hai
 In order to improve the flow of dams, the river basin was widened in Latur last year, due to the release of indiscriminate water into the fields where significant water reserves have been depleted

 Municipal Commissioner Kaustubh Divegaonkar has announced that the 'live stock' of water in Manjra is over
 baaki 'ded stock' se kisi tarah ek saal kaam chalaaya ja saktaa he , vah bhi tab jab pani kii aapurti niyamit na hokar antaraal ke baad kii jaae
 Minister of State for Water Resources Vijay Shivtare acknowledges that excessive use of water in sugarcane farming is a major reason for water scarcity
 ve kehete hai, ''par maine vibhaag ke adhikariyon ko naharon main pani chhodie kaa nirdesh diya he taaki vah kuon tak pahunch sake
 So even if the water level of the dam has gone down, there will be enough water in the local wells
 '' vahiin jal aapurti mantri babanrao lonikar kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ganne or kele kii kheti main pani ke atyadhik dohan ko rokane ke liye ek kanoon taiyaar karegi, khaastaur par pani kii kami vaale ilaakon ke liye
 The acute water shortage in the election year may cause problems for the ruling BJP and Shiv Sena

 Experts have warned that if the solution to the growing water crisis is not resolved quickly, the population of this area may migrate to Mumbai and Pune on a large scale

 It has been common discussion in national and international media that PM Modi hugs or hugs foreign leaders? But after discussing the motion of no confidence in the Lok Sabha on Friday, the manner in which Congress President Rahul Gandhi hugged PM Modi was unexpected, which was not expected, and he was ridiculed
 america yatra main modi ne fasebuk ke pramukh mark jakarberg ko jahaan apni baahon main bhar liya tha, vahiin neuyork main tatkaaleen raashtrapati baraak obama ke saath bhi aisa hi kiya
 During an event in India, Modi was seen removing Zuckerberg from the front in which it seems that he does not like the camera and anyone in between
 modi ne abu dhabi ke yuvaraj shaikh mohammad bin jayed al-nahyan ko bhi gale lagaaya tha
 Modi also hugged Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott
 magar gale lagane kii sabase badi ghatana janvari 2015 main tab ghati jab unhone raashtrapati obama ko apane seene se lagaaya
 Perhaps the foreign media did not expect this
 isi tarah modi kaa kai anya videshi netaaon ko gale lagaana charchaaon main rahaa
 The discussion about Modi's manner of embracing foreign guests or hosts was so intensified that the Congress did not miss the Modi government's target of the issue

 It is said that even when he came to meet Hariprasad, he had to wait for about an hour at the Congress headquarters, after which the speculation about the alliance started
 haalanki donon hi partiyon ke netaaon ne is tarah kii dharanaon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki gathjod kii prabal sambhaavna he
 Sources said that the Congress wants a clear assurance from the JMM that the new government will get the support of six independent mlas

 JMM sources said that the party has agreed to give 10 out of the 14 Lok Sabha seats to the Congress, in which the Congress will also have to satisfy the RJD
 hemanth sorain ne congress netaaon se apni pichhali mulakaaton ke dauraan spasht kar diya tha ki loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye gathbandhan tab tak nahin ban saktaa, jab tak rajya main congress-jeemem gathbandhan kii sarkaar nahin banaai jaae

 isse pehle 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main donon dalon ne milakar chunaav ladaa tha or congress ko chah vahiin jhamumo ko chaar siton par safalataa mili thi
 The RJD and CPI then contested the coalition and won two and one seats respectively

 The JMM has 18 members and the Congress 13 in the 81-member assembly
 unhen 11 or vidhayakon kaa samarthan chahie hoga
 The RJD has five mlas in the state

 In a thrilling match, the two teams were tied 1–1 on both regular and extra time followed by a penalty shootout
 penalty shootout main brazil kii taraf se david luies, marcelo or nemaar ne gol kiye lekin willian or halk chook gaye
 On the other hand, only Chilean Aranguiz and Marcelo Diaz were able to seduce Julio Caesar

 He was also voted Man of the Match
 brazil kii taraf se david luies ne 18wein minute main jabaki chile ke liye sanches ne 32wein minute main gol kiya lekin iske baad donon tiimon ke kuch achche prayaason ke baavjood gol nahin hua or match penalty shootout main khinch gaya
 This is the third time in the World Cup while Brazil won in the penalty shootout
 usne isse pehle 1994 main italy or 1998 main netherland ko is tarah se haraaya tha
 He has managed to make it to the last eight in the sixth consecutive World Cup
 shuru main dabaav main dikhi brazil kii timbrazil kii team khel ke shuru main kuch dabaav main dikhi or vah apane chir parichit andaaj main khulkar nahin khel pai lekin usne dhire dhire lay hasil kii
 The five-time champion took the lead in the 18th minute and put pressure on his neighbor
 luies ke is gol main nemaar kii bhoomika rahi jinhone brazil ke baayen chor se behtareen move banaaya
 Thiago Silva pushed him closer to the goal of Chile but here Luis showed his agility and speed to increase the pressure on Gonzalo Zara
 vah aakhir main gend ko gol ke hawaale karne main safal rahe
 Even though at that time it seemed that the ball touched Zara's knee before getting into the net, but the referee scored the goal to Luiz
 nemaar kii teji or kaushal kaa namoona khel ke 26wein minute main dikhaa jab vah lagbhag midfield se gend ko akele lekar aage bade
 He dodged the Chilean defense but his shot went out of the left end
 lekin jashn manaane kaa mauka chile ke prashansakon ko mila
 The Brazilian defense disintegrated, and Chile took full advantage of it
 sanches ko box ke andar gend mili or tab unke saamne keval golkeeper julia sijar the jinhen chakaane main unhen kisi tarah kii dikkat nahin hui
 In this way, the score became 1–1 in the 32nd minute
 doosraa half bhi rahaa rochakadusre half main bhi donon tiimon ke bich rochak jang jari rahi
 The Hulk scored in the 55th minute but the referee called him a 'handball' and showed the Brazilian footballer a yellow card
 chile ke paas 64wein minute main badhat banane kaa sunaharaa avasar tha jab charles aranguij ke karaare shot ko sijar ne badi khubsuurati se bachaakar brazil par aayaa khatra taala tha
 Brazil then made some good efforts
 fred kii jagah maidan par utre jo 75wein minute main halk ke cross par sahi tarah se shot lagane main naakaam rahe
 After this, Brazil could not gain the lead due to the best effort of Chile's goalkeeper Bravo
 chile ke captain nemaar or halk ke karaare shot ko bachaakar unhen gol karne se roka
 Brazil held the ball for most of the time when the match drew in extra time
 is bich usne chile ke gol par kuch hamale bhi kiya lekin braavo kii mustaidi se uske prayaas naakaam hote rahe
 Meanwhile, Chile had put all their strength to save the goal
 use is bich keval ek acha mauka mila
 Chile got a free hit from close to the box in the 105th minute but Sanchez's shot went out
 khel jab aakhri kshanon main tha tab chile ko gol karne kaa bahut acha avasar mila tha
 At that time substitute forward Marcio Pinilla had only the goalkeeper in front but his shot went out
 brazil ne javaabi hamalaa kiya lekin nemaar use iskaa phayda nahin dilaa paae jisase match penalty shootout main chalaa gaya
 Among the nine planets, there is only one Saturn, whose birth anniversary is celebrated
 har saal jyeshtha maheene kii amavasya ko shani jayanti manaai jaati he
 Experts say that Lord Shani was born on this day, due to which this day is celebrated as Shani Jayanti
 jaane, 2017 main kis par he shani kii tedi najarais baar shani jayanti 25 may ko aa rahi he
 It is Thursday on 25 May
 aise main is baar alag-alag raashiyon par shani kaa prabhaav bhi alag-alag dekhne ko milegaa
 According to experts, Shani Jayanti is not auspicious this time
 kyon shubh nahin maani ja rahi he is baar kii shani jayanti
 
 
 Know that according to Vinod Mishra, the mystery of Shani Dev's crooked vision, due to falling on Kritika Nakshatra on Thursday, Yamaghantak Yoga is becoming, which is not considered auspicious
 yah yoga subah 5:26 baje se 12:01 baje tak rahegaa
 So during this time, you should avoid doing any new work or important work
 is yoga ke dauraan siddh yoga bhi shuru hoga, jo subah 5:26 baje se shuru hokar agle din raat 1:14 baje tak rahegaa
 Because of having auspicious yoga like Siddha Yoga, the effect of Yamaghantak Yoga will be reduced slightly

 The committee has also ordered a review examination of them on 3 June

 Education Minister said - there has been a lapse of embarrassing answers of topper in intermediate examination and his knowledge is jealous of Jahanihar, while Bihar Education Minister Ashok Chaudhary has admitted that there has been some lapse in the system which stung the credibility of the government
 mantri ne kaha ki ek saptaah ke andar puure maamle kii jaanch kar lee jaaegi or jo bhi doshi paae jaaenge un par shakht karrwai kii jaaegi

 However, the board argues that in view of the earlier history of this college, it was kept in Patna to keep a special watch on it
 lekin amarendra kumaar singh kaa kahana he ki patna main is college se jude logon ne sab kuch parde ke peeche se apane haq main karvaa liya
 Amrendra Kumar Singh, who was a professor in the same college from 2011 till the establishment of several Rajvishunadev Rai College, opened the former professor of the college, saying that there is no facility of writing in the college, but grading according to money is as much as two numbers
 Get iske liye college main e, bi, si, grad bane hue hai
 Most college students study in this college
 kai chaatr kota yaa anya jagahon par koching karte hai or pariksha yahaan se dete hai
 At the same time, one gets a job as a teacher employed on the basis of numbers, so the students here are ready to pay more and more money
 saath main is college kaa board main acchhee paith hona bhi chaatro ko aakarshith karata he
 Last year, a copy of 215 students of this college was written with the same handwriting
 is maamle kii jaanchbihar bordne kii thi
 The investigation found the case to be correct
 is college ko blike list karne kaa prastaav bhi tha, lekin college ne na sirf maamle ko manage kiya balki phir se apane college ko top bhi karaayaa
 The examination was conducted under the supervision of CCTV, although the administration had a special eye on this college in this time exam

 Then where the disturbance happened is a matter of investigation

 The same applies in the case of balanced funds
 is shrenee main ghatata pravaah iskaa saboot haih association of mutual funds (eemepha) ke aankadon ke mutabik, june 2018 main yah 1,482 karod ru

 The decline began in April when the Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) came into effect
 bazaar main anischitata ke chalate nikat ateet main kam laabh ke saath hi dediti ke aane se balanced funds main nivesh par nakaaratmak prabhaav padaa he
 What should investors do in such a situation? Volatile markets and low profits "continuation of Monthly Dividends" have always been an attraction for investors to invest in balanced funds
 jis yojana main jitna adhik labhaansh kaa record rahata he, usamen utana hi adhik nivesh hota he
 Most fund groups that previously announced annual or half-yearly dividends started making monthly announcements due to favorable markets
 iske alaava phixd inakam vaale vikalpon main byaaj ghatana bhi isamen madadgaar sabit hua
 Most of the funds have not fared well recently due to the volatility of the stock market
 isamen balanced fund bhi shaamil hai
 The net asset value (NAV) of the schemes falls to the extent of declared dividend
 bajaj capital main senior veepi or saajha kosh ke rashtriya pramukh aanjaneya gautam kehete hai, "kuch maheenon main sheyaron main ritern ghatane se enevi main giravat hui, jisase in funds main niveshkon kii ruchi ghati he
 "10% on equity and share-related schemes in DDT Budget 2018 on equity (11 if you add 12 percent surcharge and 4 percent cess
" 64 pratishat) dediti kaa praavdhaan shuru kiya gaya tha
 Balanced funds also fall in this range, hence DDT is imposed on them, due to which very little money comes in the hands of the investor
 is prakaar agar yojana 100 ru
 If you declare a dividend of only 88 in your hand
 35 ru
 Only come
 leader 7 financial adwiserij ke sansthaapak suresh sadagopan kehete hai, "ek to kam laabh or upar se dediti balanced funds kaa aakarshan ghataate ja rahe hai
 "gautam also believes:" The introduction of DDT on equity funds has reduced the attractiveness of balanced funds among investors seeking monthly dividends
 ''aage kaa rastabalanced fund niveshkon ke liye aakarshak nivesh hai kyonki isamen jokhim kam hota he or ye puri tarah share aadhaarit fund se kam jokhim vaale hote hai
 Says Gautam, "while it is reasonable to think that balanced funds are relatively conservative share-oriented funds, this category is not an option for regular income for investors
 ''unki salaah he ki jo log lambey samay main share bazaar se laabh paanaa chaahate hai or unhen niyamit aay kii jarurat nahin he, unhen santulit laabh or share kii mishrit shrenee kaa vikalp apnaanaa chahie

 The Sanskrit Department of Delhi University is preparing for a radical change in the pages of history
 sanskrit vibhaag ne ek project kaa elaan kiya he, jiske tahat aaryon ke bharat se sambandh par nae sire se adhyayan kiya jayega
 It is also interesting that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) considers Aryans to be the real citizens of India and in recent times has insisted on the need to rewrite history
 darasal, itihaas kii adhiktar kitabon main yahi likhaa he ki ek vakt mohenjodaro or hadappa jaisi jagahon par sindhu ghati sabhyataa phool-fal rahi thi

 jabaki sangh parivaar or sahyogi sanghathan kehete rahe hai ki yah baat europea soch ke prabhaav main aakar likhi gai he
 The Sangh and allied organizations are of the opinion that Arya did not come from outside, rather he lived in India and went from here to other places
 aaryon ke baahar se bharat main aane kii baat german bhashaa or sanskrit ke vidwaan maxmooler ne di thi
 Work on the project began: According to the news published in an English newspaper, the Sanskrit department announced a project in the presence of Gujarat Governor OP Kohli and VC Dinesh Singh last week, which will draw arguments based on the study and the relation of Aryans to India

 In the case of a private bill prepared by Meenakshi Natarajan as an MP, the messenger is equally important
 pehali baar sansad sadsy baniin natarajan itani sidhi-sadhi bhi nahin hai
 She is an important member of Rahul Gandhi's brigade
 isliye jab unhone media kaa galaa ghontne kii paryaapt kshamta vaale print and electronic media standerds and regulation bill kaa masauda taiyaar kiya to khud unke sangi-saathi bhi chakra gaye
 Was it his own initiative or did he do so at the behest of his leader? The language of the draft is of a well-known legal expert and Natarajan is not an expert advocate of the Constitution
 natarajan is bill ko 30 april ko sansad main pesh karne vaali thim lekin us din ve vahaan nahin pahunchin or unka bill bhi pesh nahin ho sakaa
 The draft of the bill proposes the formation of a Media Regulatory Authority, which has the authority to restrict or postpone coverage of any event which may pose a "threat to the country from any foreign or internal source"
 
 teen sadasyon vaali is athurity kaa chayan soochna prasaaran mantralay tathaa sarkaar ke anya namit log karenge taaki sarkaar ke paas purna niyantran or sensorship adhikaar rahen
 50 lakh if found guilty in the proposed bill
 ke jurmaane kaa praavdhaan he
 The bill also recommends drastic measures like stopping the functioning of a media organization for 11 months and revoking its license
 yah prastaavit athurity ko artiai ke daayre se baahar rakhkar upie sarkaar kii un shandaar uplabdhiyon kaa bhi safaya kar detaa he, jo soochna ke adhikaar kanoon lagu karne ke jariye ise hasil hui hai
 The Congress is confused as to how it should react to the initiative
 rahul gandhi se unki najdiki ke kaaran congress ke netaa yah tay nahin kar paa rahe hai ki yah natarajan kaa apana ati-utsaah he yaa unke naam par phulayaa gaya pareekshan gubbaaraa he
 According to a Congress MP, "his boss is uninterested in the media
" apane number badhaane ke liye shaayad unhone bandook tham lee hogi
 "they do not rule out the possibility that Natarajan may have enlisted the help of a Congress lawyer MP in this task
" bhartiya janata party ne sandeshvahak natarajan par damdaar hamalaa karne main jaraa bhi deree nahin dikhaai
 BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy said, "since they are close to Rahul Gandhi, it would be good to give Rahul a clarification in this matter
" ''vivaad main ek baar rahul gandhi kaa naam aa jane ke baad congress ke paas natarajan or unke bill se pallaa jhadane ke alaava koi or vikalp nahin bachaa
 Congress general secretary and party's media cell president Janardan Dwivedi said, "this is not the vision of Rahul Gandhi
 na hi natarajan ke bill par unhone apni sahmati di thi
 "it is important to get the Congress response from Dwivedi first

 Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajiv Shukla also jumped into the fray to make up for the loss
 unhone kaha, ''yah natarajan kii apni pahal thi
 Any MP has the right to introduce a private bill
 yah koi sarkari bill to he nahin
 After two days of silence, Natarajan finally opened her mouth to the media on the evening of May 2
 unhone kaha ki is bill se rahul gandhi kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 He said, "if the bill has not been introduced, then there is no longer any justification to talk about it
 ye mere nijee vichaar hai
 Despite repeated attempts by India Today, 38-year-old Natarajan was not available to say anything else in the matter
 rahul ke karyaalay main secretary ke taur par niyukt natarajan kaa party main utthan asaadhaaran he
 Although she is originally Tamil, she has been elected from Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh in the current Parliament
 congress ke ek yuva netaa bataate hai, ''rahul yuva congress ke shiviron main jo kuch bolte hai, natarajan usee ko doharaati hai
 Hard work does not win you patronage or clan, but whenever Rahul says this, he takes the name of Natarajan as an example
 '' chashma chadha gambhir cheharaa lekar or 'auto waalon' kii shikaayat main badbadaate hue party baithkon main pahunchane kii natarajan kii adaa ne bhi unhen unke menter rahul kii najaron main grassroot kaaryakarta ke rup main chadhaaya he
 But Congress colleagues of Mandsaur, the constituency of Lekir Natarajan, do not agree with him
 party kaa sthaneey netritv kshetra ko paryaapt samay nahin dene ke kaaran unase naaraaz he
 When Rahul reached Bhopal in 2011, a Congress leader from Mandsaur handed him a letter prepared on Natarajan saying, "it will take you 15 minutes to reach the next rally by car
" is dauraan kripaya ise padhein or hamaari sansad sadsy ke bare main or kuch jaane
 When Natarajan came on stage to speak at the 2010 Congress General Assembly in Burari, Rahul and Sonia Gandhi listened to him with great attention

 1988 main rajeev gandhi sarkaar loksabhaa main kukhyat difvmeshan bill lekar ai thi
 But such a huge movement arose against this proposed government bill that Rajiv Gandhi had to deal with one of the biggest shocks he got during his entire tenure of 46 months

 unhone kaha ki kek par jo 'bhaiya' likhaa tha uskaa matlab yah he ki raaj thakare bade bhai samaan hai or ise uttar bharatiyon se jodakar nahin dekha janaa chahie
 Saraswat said that since the cake was made by a North Indian, he had written 'bhaiya' on it

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 se pehle narendra modi sarkaar ne savarna samudaay ko 10 fisadi aarakshan dene kaa trump card chalaa he
 In the cabinet meeting on Monday, the Modi government has decided to give reservation to people belonging to backward upper caste community on economic basis
 iske liye sarkaar samvidhan sanshodhan bill mangalvaar ko sansad main pesh kar sakati he
 Interestingly, the BJP has taken a step on Monday on the upper caste reservation
 lekin daliton or pichde virgon ke netaaon main argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ko chhod den to adhikansh netaa garib savarnon ko aarakshan dene ke pakshdhar rahe hai
 Congress had raised the demand for 10% upper caste reservation, then parties like SP, BSP, LJP and RPI have been advocating for 10 to 25% reservation, but now when the Modi government is talking about amending the constitution, the question arises How many of these parties will support the government in Parliament
 mayawati bhi savarna aarakshan kii samarthakbahujan samaaj party kii adhyaksh mayawati kaaphi lambey samay se garib savarnon ko aarakshan dene kii maang karti rahi hai
 Mayawati has been in favor of amending the constitution to give separate reservation on the basis of economic status to the poor of Savarna society and Muslim and other religious minority society
 upi main mukhyamantri rahete hue mayawati ne centre sarkaar ko is sambandh main chitthee likhi thi
 Now the question arises whether this bill will get the moral support of Mayawati
 kyonki loksabhaa main bispi kaa koi saansad nahin he
 The question of reservation was also raised against the 10% Mangmodi government of Congress on 6 September when the upper castes announced Bharat Bandh in protest against the SC-ST Amendment Act 2018
 congress ke rashtriya pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne bayaan diya tha ki garib savarnon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan milanaa chahie
 LJP 15 percent upper caste reservation: Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has also been in favor of upper caste reservation in the Modi government
 unhone patna main garib savarnon ke paksh main 15 fisadi aarakshan dene kii baat kahi thi
 It has to be seen how much he is with the government
 athawale ne 25 fisadi aarakshan kii maangarpiai ke adhyaksh or modi sarkaar main mantri ramdaas athawale bhi lagaataar garib savarna aarakshan kii maang karte rahe hai
 Athawale advocated 25 percent reservation
 unhone kaha tha ki savarnon main sabhi aarthinc rup se sampann nahin hote, isliye savarna jatiyon ko 8 lakh rupee kii krimilayer lagaakar 25 pratishat aarakshan diya janaa chahie

 congress iske liye kaam karegi or iskaa prachaar bhi karegi
 The same will be done with Bhopal
 Earlier the slogan was 'achhe Din'
 
 
 Modi ji used to say 'achhe Din', public used to say 'aaenge'

 In the first over, Virender Sehwag was out before opening the account and the pressure on India increased
 world cap jeetne kaa sapana or dur hote hue nazar aayaa, jab bharat ke sabase anbhavi khilaadi sachin tendulkar sirf 18 ran banaakar out ho gaye
 Then India's score was just 31 runs
 viraat kohli or gautam gambhir ke bich acchhee saajhedaari hui
 Together, both of them raised India's score to 100
 jab bharat kaa score 114 ran tha tab kohli 35 ran ke nijee score par out ho gaye
 Now Mahendra Singh Dhoni promoted himself in batting order and came to bat before Yuvraj Singh
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki captain kuch kar dikhaanaa chaahate he
 Dhoni's decision proved to be correct
 dhoni ne maidan ke chaaron taraf shandaar shots khelte hue bharat kii pari ko aage badhaayaa, 49wein over main kulshekhara ke nauven over kii duusari gend par chakka markar bharat ko jeet dilwaai
 Dhoni played an unbeaten innings of 91 runs facing 79 balls
 gautam gambhir ne bhi 97 ran kii shandaar pari kheli
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni received the title of "man of the Match" and Yuvraj Singh for "man of the Series"
 agar record kii baat kii jaae to sachin tendulkar ke naam worldcup main sabase zyada ran banane kaa record abhi tak kaayam he
 Sachin has scored 2278 runs in 45 matches at an average of 57 which includes six centuries and 15 fifties
 sachin ke baad worldcup main sabase zyada ran banane kaa record riki ponting or bryan lara ke naam hai
 When it comes to bowling, Glenn mcgrath holds the record for most wickets

 kanoon bana naagarikta sanshodhan bilrashtrapati ramnath kovind kii manjuuri ke baad bana kanoonpurvottar main lagaataar jari he virohatmam virodh or pradarshnon ke baavjood naagarikta sanshodhan bill ab kanoon ban gaya he
 After passing the bill from Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, President Ram Nath Kovind has approved it, after which it has become law
 yani pakistan-bangladesh-afghanistan se aae hue hindu-jain-buddha-sikh-isai-parsi sharnaarthi aasaani se bharat kii naagarikta hasil kar paaenge
 The bill was introduced by the Union Home Minister Amit Shah first in the Lok Sabha, then in the Rajya Sabha
 kai ghanton kii tikhi bahes ke baad ye bill sadan main paas hua, loksabhaa main to modi sarkaar ke paas bahumat tha lekin rajyasabha main bahumat naa hone ke baavjood sarkaar ko jeet mili he
 Why is there opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Bill, what new law has become and what is going to change
 is nazar daalen
 
 
 What is the Citizenship Amendment Act? To change the Citizenship Act, 1955, the Central Government brought a Citizenship Amendment Bill
 bill ke kanoon banane ke saath hi isamen badlaav ho gaya
 Now hindu-jain-buddhist-sikh-christian-parsi refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan will be able to get citizenship of India
 abhi tak unhen avaidh sharnaarthi mana jaataa tha
 Earlier, it was compulsory to stay in India for 11 years on taking citizenship of India, but now this time has been reduced to 6 years
 raashtrapati ne di bill ko manzoorikin sharnaarthiyon ko milegaa phayda?kendriya grih mantri amit shah ne sansad main apane bhaashan main daawa kiya tha ki aise lakhon-karodon log hai jinhen is kanoon se phayda milegaa
 According to the new law, it will be applicable to all refugees irrespective of the date
 yani jis taarikh ko vah bharat main aae, tabhi se unhen bharat kaa naagarik maan liya jayega
 a cutoff date has also been released by the government, all hindu-jain-buddhist-sikh-christian-parsi refugees who came before 31 December 2014 will get citizenship of India
 kahaan par lagu nahin hoga ye kanoon?modi sarkaar ke is kanoon kaa purvottar main jabardast virodh ho rahaa he
 In many states including Assam, Meghalaya, people have taken to the streets and are constantly demanding the withdrawal of the bill
 haalanki, sarkaar ne kanoon lagu karte vakt ye bhi elaan kiya he ki meghalaya, assam, arunachal, manipur ke kuch kshetron main kanoon lagu nahin hoga
 Due to the demand of the local people, the Central Government has issued an Inner Line Permit, due to this, these rules will not apply here
 purvottar ke rajyon kaa kahana he ki agar sharnaarthiyon ko yahaan par naagarikta di jaaegi to unki asmita, culture par asar padegaa
 The Inner Line Permit is a travel document issued by the Government of India to its citizens so that they can travel for a specified period in a protected area
 kyon ho rahaa he kanoon kaa virodh?is kanoon kaa virodh purajor tareeke se ho rahaa he, sadak se lekar sansad tak sarkaar par log hamalavar hai
 Many opposition parties, including the Congress, are calling this law a violation of the Constitution and against the basic ideas of India
 congress ne sansad main bhi is bill kaa virodh kiya tha or ginaya tha ki ye bill artical 14 kaa ulanghan karata he, jo ki samaan naagarikta kaa hal detaa he
 Not just Congress but many lawyers and thinkers have also called this bill a violation of law
 kanoonee jaankariyon kii maane, to ye bill naa sirf artical 14, balki artical 5, artical 21 kaa bhi ulanghan karata he
 Many petitions against this bill have also come into force in the Supreme Court
 vipaksh kaa aarope ye bhi he ki sarkaar pehle CAB laakar NRC kii taiyaari kar rahi he, jo ki alpsankhyakon ke khilaaf he
 Unlike the legal perspective, this bill is being opposed in the Northeast because it is affecting their identity
 purvottar ke kai chaatr sanghathanon kaa kahana he ki bahari log agar assam-arunachal samet anya rajyon main basenge, to unki bhashaa, asmita, samskruti par asar padegaa or ye bada nuksaan hoga

 raksha pravaktaa ne bataaya, 'shaam kareeb 6 baje pakistani sena ne sunderbani sector main mortar se gole dagkar evam golibari kar bina uksaave ke sangharshaviram kaa ulanghan kiya
 "he told," the Indian Army responded in a strong and effective manner
 yahaan kisi ke bhi hataahat hone kii khabar nahin he
 Significantly, ceasefire violations on behalf of Pakistan have increased since the attack by the Air Force on the training camp of terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed in Balakot on 26 February
 seemaa ke us taraf se niyantran rekha ke aas-paas lagaataar goliyon kii gunj sunai de rahi he
 At this time, apart from the firing, Pakistan is seen in the face of burglary on many fronts

 Take the cartoon character, Savita Bhabhi, as an Indian woman with a high-profile kharti available on the Internet, a visitor who seems to be a brother in a relationship that breaks her virginity, of a new servant whom she had heard about a friend Lives nearby, sees fantasies about naughty salesmen selling bras, and even two 18-year-old lords from the neighborhood
 ab jaraa savita ko hakeekat kii duniya main rakhkar dekhie
 India today-ac nielsen-org Marg Savita Bhabhi has two aspects, like the statistics related to pornographic films of sex survey
 kya vah silicon vaili main kahin baithe vaishvik mandi kii maar se trast kuch lanpat yuvakon kii gadhi gai koi kaalpanik paatr he? yaa vah vaastavik jivan kii anek bhabhiyon kaa milajula aisa rup he jo jivan ko coffee ke chammachon se nahin, remote ke clic karne se aankati he, jaise apane nae gharelu upkarnon ko aajamaa rahi ho? to devio or sadgajanon jaraa gaur karen
 If TV has created possibilities in Savita Bhabhi's dull life, then DVD players and personal computers have turned it into reality
 sex kii desi devi kaa swaagat kijiehtash gruhiniyon ke din ab lad gaye hai
 She has been replaced by lustful housewives
 gharelu devi ko ab alavida kahen
 Welcome to the desi goddess of sex, whose workplace is becoming a bedroom rather than a kitchen
 yadi shahari bhartiya purush ke man main ashleel filmon kii jabardast bhukh he to bhartiya mahila bhi thik uske peeche teen haath kii sammanjanak duuri par khadi he
 62 percent of men accept pornography, this is not new
 dilachasp yah he ki har paanch main se ek mahila ise sweekaar karti he
 Not only this, one in four also watches it
 yah bhi dilachasp he ki jinhone ashleel filmein dekhi hai, unamem chaar main se ek mahila (23 fisadi) avivaahit or teen main ek mahila (29 fisadi) vivaahit he
 If you want to know that porn movies are flourishing as a domestic industry, then the proof is this: one in five women watched pornographic films at home
 or inamen se kareeb aadhi ne ghar par shayankaksh main iskaa lutf uthaaya, jinamein se 45 fisadi mahilaon ne nae asana ashleel filmon se siikhe
 55 percent said that their participation in watching pornographic films is agreed
 yah unki fantasy ko puraa karne kaa hi nahin, unki antarangta ko bhi nae tarah se paribhaashit karne kaa maamla he
 Is it a license to have fun? Rental videos are the most natural form of pornographic films, while one in every ten of their viewers says they would like to work in such a film if given the chance
 bangaloru main aisi mahilaon kaa pratishat sarvaadhik 19 fisadi he
 What do these figures mean in the world of pornographic films often considered male territory? Is it a license to have fun? One aspect of this can also be in the form of bullying, as happened in 2004 with Anara Gupta of Jammu
 ludhiana main 10 main se ek mahila kahati he ki usne dabaav main ashleel film dekhi
 Other elements can be independence, empowerment, which is strengthened by women's acceptance
 ashleel filmein dekhne vaali jaipur kii ek-chauthai mahilaon or patna kii 16 fisadi mahilaon ne kaha ki unhone apane sahchar ko bina bataae ise dekha
 Women are new to the sport, but they are learning fast
 purush kishoravastha main hi ashleel filmein dekhne lagate hai, to adhikansh mahilaayein bisek varsh kii umr main iske bare main jaan paati hai
 Where men are divided in terms of reading pornography and watching pornographic movies, women only like to watch movies
 ashleelata ab nishedh nahin helekhika or prakaashak urvashi butalia ko lagata he ki yah utsukata or prayog kaa mishrit rup he jo suvidhasampann varg tak simit nahin he
 "technology has given women opportunities to get lost in fantasy in their secular moments," she says
 iske saarvajanik hone kaa khatra nahin he
 "actually, there are no social media for women where they can watch indecent movies
 yah bakaul lekhika rukmani bhaayaa nair, atyaadhunik bhaavana yani boriyat ko dur karne kaa jariya bhi ho saktaa he
 She says, "ugly feelings like rashness and rashness often go away from entering the realm of ugliness
 '' paanch main se 3 purushon ke ashleelata ko sweekaar karne or chaar main se kareeb teen ke isamen lipt rahane se jaahir he, ashleelata ab nishedh nahin he
 Pornographic films provide business opportunities in India, but what is the meaning of porn in a world where girls in music albums appear in top-notch costumes and crowd-starring films have top class stars? Actually who should be considered obscene? Is it to fill the empty screen space in the visual culture that is still badly censored today? It can be a shy housewife who can be engrossed in Rati playing on her first date
 yah koi vyast pati ho saktaa he jo der raat san tivi ke gaanon kii jhalak dekhne ke liye tivi on kar saktaa he
 In the new comedy Jack and Miri Make a Porn, which explodes in America, the couple indulging in supernatural love can understand love after preparing x grade internet video clippings to pay off their debt
 ve apni film ke baad shaayad safal bhi ho gaye
 The heavy-handed Swallowing Coccino proved to be a tremendous hit and his company is helping dull and tired couples bring new freshness to sex life through their homegrown films
 mandi ke daur main ashleel filmon ne bharat main kaarobaar ke avasar muhaiyaa karaae hai
 Every age has its own definition of obscenity
 Every age has its own definition of obscenity
 aise desh main jahaan ashleel kamedi paariwarik filmon kaa mukhauta lagaakar pesh kii ja rahi he or bachche fatty ankhon se unhen dekh rahe hai, par jahaan parade par chumban ke drishy aaj bhi khabar banate hai, isaki paribhaasha abhi taiyaar ho rahi he
 Consider this as well
 yadi vaataanukoolit gharon main ashleelata ko kamlipsaa vruddhi vaale kaarak ke bataur sweekaar kiya ja rahaa he, to inkaa nirmaan sillen bhare kamaron main dabaav daalkar kiya ja rahaa he taaki aatankwaad kii vittiya madad kii ja sake
 By the way, Indian men, women like to see Desi girl and Desi boy in porn movies in the same way as celebrities
 lekin khatra yah he ki jitani ve aisi filmein dekhenge, utane hi bhaawanaaon se rahit hote jaaenge
 In fact, crossing the boundaries of Ratikrida is fine as long as the game remains
 varanaa, bakaul nair, sab kuch naatakeey lagegaa
 This program is dedicated to the millions of farmers of India who have died under the debt of the bank

 i wish one of these farmers had been clever like Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowki, would have saved the lives of so many farmers
 lakhanu main aaj hi bundelkhand se aayaa ek kisaan ram raaj aatmahatya kii koshish main ped par chadh gaya jab upi main ram raaj laane ke liye vahaan kii sarkaar bajet pesh karne ja rahi thi
 If Ram Raj had come to do games like Nirav Modi, he too would have been wearing a black suit rental suit in Davos, standing behind the Prime Minister
 aap ye tasviir dekhie ki kaise police vaale ek kisaan ko uske bete kii duhai dekar bachaa rahe hai ki ram raaj aa jaao, tumhaara betaa ro rahaa he
 Agricultural economist Devendra Sharma has calculated that if the loan of up to one and a half lakhs is waived, then from this 11000 crores to 30 lakh farmers will become debt free
 dedh lakh kaa karza he ram raaj par, jaan dene lakhanu aa gaye, 11000 karod kaa chuunaa lagaakar neerav modi chale gaye neuyark, usase pehle gaye sweetzaraland jiske bare main kaha jaataa he ki kaala dhan kaa ghar he, vahiin ke daavos main jaataa he or pradhanmantri ke saath photo khinchaa letaa he
 We talked to the farmers what they think about this miracle of Nirav Modi
 15 farvari ke press conference main ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki neerav modi pradhanmantri ke saath nahin gaye the, balki kanfideration of indian industry (siaiai) ke log lekar gaye

 today's Times of India, c Unnikrishnan wrote the news that in the year of 2016, Nirav Modi had to pay a penalty of 48 crores because in December 2014 he was smuggling by showing diamonds of 1000 crores
 diarectorot of revenue intelligence, diarai main do saal cese chalaa, phir 48 karod kaa jurmaana bharna padaa
 The question is whether the DRI investigated further after such a big theft or confined itself only to this case
 smagaling kaa maamla chalata rahaa phir bhi kaise yah shaks vitt mantri ke saath 2016 main daavos gaya
 CBI was going to start an investigation, then it is present in the photo frame with Nirav Modi, Prime Minister Modi
 shaayad isiilie ravishankar prasad kah rahe the ki photo kii raajnneeti na ho, taaki logon ko pataa na chale
 He should have told all this when he had come for the press conference
 pradhanmantri ke saath bhale na gaye hon magar 1000 karod kaa maal chori se baahar bhejne vaala vitt mantri ke saath daavos jaae kya yah thik he
 Nirav Modi is in a hotel in New York

 The dock media immediately started writing news that 5000 crores were recovered
 isi game ko aapako samajhnaa he
 Consignment is seized, it takes several months to years to fix the price
 aap kisi bhi iskar adhikari se puch sakate hai
 But it is also known that there are also gems experts in the team of raids, who are also telling the price along with them
 jo bhi he, chapa to bharat kii dukaanon par padaa he lekin neerav modi jis hotel main he usee ke paas neuyark main unka ek or store he, duniya ke kai deshon main dukaan he, kya vahaan bhi chaape pad rahe hai
 Are you aware of this godi media ne likh diya ki paisa baraamad ho gaya
 Has that paper also been recovered, have the names of those people with whom this game has been played together be recovered
 bharat ke chah shaharon main 20 thikaanon par chaape pade hai
 The Income Tax Department has sealed 21 accounts of Nirav Modi's company
 neerav modi kaa passport radd ho gaya he
 It was canceled when there was an uproar
 is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin mila ki 1 janvari ko kaise apane parivaar ke saath faraar hua
 By January 1, the investigating agency did not know at all that Nirav Modi was preparing to conduct a raid here
 31 janvari kii exiaar ke pej number aath par saaf saaf likhaa he or ye exiaar ke hi shabd hai jisamen kaha gaya he ki ham aapse aagrah karte hai ki upar die gaye naamon ke khilaaf luk out notice jari kiya jaae taaki wo desh chhod kar ja nahin sake or kanoon apana kaam nahin kar paae

 The Indian Express has written that between 2011 and 2017, 150 letters of undertaking have been released
 yah sawaal mahatvapurn ho saktaa he ki ghotaalaa kiske raaj main shuru hua, kya yah mahatvapurn nahin he ki us paise kaa hissaa kis kis ke paas gaya
 Who are close to them? indian express ne likhaa he ki 17 bank is ghotaale kii chapet main hai
 Apart from 11,300 crores, 3000 crores have been scammed
 charchaa neerav modi kii zyaada ho rahi he magar is khel kaa bada khilaadi mehul chaukasee bhi he
 The one whose name Ravi Shankar Prasad was not able to take properly but the Prime Minister was taking it properly
 pradhanmantri jis hamaare mehul bhai ko sambodhit kar rahe hai ye vahi mehul bhai hai jo neerav modi ke partner hai
 Complaints had been sent against these two from Mumbai Police Commissioner to Bangalore Police Commissioner to all agencies of Finance Ministry several times
 yah shikaayat 2013 se kii ja rahi thi
 Yet this man is present in front of him in the Prime Minister's official program in 2015
 aapako lagata he ki kabhi kuch hoga
 If five people had not complained about the matter without risking their lives, then the history of this scam would have been easily suppressed
 ye paanch log wo hai jo har agency ko likh rahe the, dhamkiyaan sun rahe the, jindagi daanv par lagaakar shikaayat kar rahe the
 Had it been heard then, Punjab National Bank would not have lost Rs 11,300 crore
 shikhar jain, vaibhav khurania
 Hari Prasad, Digvijay Singh Jadeja and Santosh Srivastava
 in logon ne khub patr likhe magar har jagah se niraashaa haath lagi
 Later, he himself started getting frustrated that nothing will happen now
 punjab neshnal bank ne 16 janvari ko nahin pakadaa hota to yah pataa hi nahin chalata ki kuch log gitanjali company se istipha dekar isaki ladaai lard rahe hai
 The first letter in this case was written on 4 May 2015 to Delhi-based SIFO i
e
 Serious Fraud Investigation Organization
 6 may ko mumbai police kamishnar or saare joint police kamishnar ko likhaa gaya
 The copy was also sent to the Ministry of Finance, Corporate Ministry, Enforcement Directorate (ED), CBI and Economic Offenses Wing Delhi
 26 july 2016 ko pehali baar pradhanmantri karyaalay ko shikaayat kii copy bheji gai
 The PMO immediately sent this copy to the Registrar of Companies
 register of company korporate maamle ke mantralay ke tahat aata he
 On 29 July 2016, these people again wrote to the Registrar of Companies
 do maheene baad register of company kaa jawaab aata he ki maamla band ho gaya he
 How the Registrar of Companies closed the case without talking to the complainant
 agar eemaandaaree se jaanch hui hoti to punjab neshnal bank ko itane bade ghotaale kaa saamana nahin karnaa padataa
 Now come on Congress vs BJP
 donon ke aarope pratyarope main ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhie
 The questions and answers are related to this matter or not or whether other third stories have been wrapped back and forth to the right
 congress ke pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne paanch sawaal or puche or kaha ki yah ghotaalaa 11300 karod kaa nahin balki 21,306 karod kaa ho gaya he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad came from the government on the first day, today HRD minister Prakash Javadekar saheb came
 unhone elahabaad bank ke nideshak dinesh doobe ke bayaan ke hawaale se congress ko gheraa
 Dinesh Dubey has said that Nirav who was pressurized in 2013, resigned to give loan to Modi
 kaha ki rahul gandhi neerav modi kii pradarshnee main jate hai
 After that, Nirav Modi gets a loan from Allahabad Bank
 yah ghotaalaa upie ke samay se chal rahaa he
 When it started it is important, so it should also be important how long it lasted
 aakhir farvari 2017 main aath jaali letters of anderteking kaise mil gaya neerav modi ko
 It is important for Rahul to go to the exhibition, then it should also be important for Nirav Modi to be photographed with Prime Minister Modi
 is tarah aap congress banaam bijepi ke is khel main iz ikval tu kii theory ko sabit kar dete hai
 If the Congress proved to be an equal BJP, it did not mean a scam
 polytical science main ij ikval tu kii theory meri khoj he jise chhapra ke jepi uniwarsity se patent karaane kii soch rahaa hum jahaan chaatr teen saal kaa bie chah saal main bhi nahin kar pate hai
 By the way, Jawadekar should also explain why this scam continued even after the NDA government came and complained to his government's ministries, why the Registrar of Companies responded to the complainants that your cases are closed
 tippaniyan Prakash Jhavadekar said one thing
 svachh bank mishan kii
 What is this mission 3 aktubar ko is mishan ke tahat ek din ke bheetar brokar sansthaaon, bank or companiyon ko bataanaa tha ki unke paas kitna lone baaki he
 Do you know what happened to that clean bank mission? Did everyone announce or was this mission stopped in the middle because it would have brought out the book and opened the pole for everyone
 13 sitambar 2017 ko manicontrol daat kaam par lata venkatesh kaa is par lekh he
 Lata ji is the editor anchor of CNBC and is considered an expert in the banking sector
 unhone likhaa he ki isse bainkon or companiyon ke bich ghabrahat he lekin yah kadam apane aap main krantikari he
 Did all companies and banks declare their dues, i
e
, on 3 October 2017, within a day
 hamaari jaankaree ke anusaar bainkon kaa yah swatchta mishan achaanak gaayab ho gaya
 Can't claim now because we are not experts in this field, so you should also ask any bank officer
 sab akhbaar se hi nahin pataa kiya jaataa he kuch rishtedaar bhi bataa dete hai
 On February 16, Punjab National Bank's stock fell three percent
 is ghotaale ke baad punjab neshnal bank kaa share 52 saptaah main sabase neeche chalaa gaya he
 Its shareholders have lost more than 8000 crores
 krishi arthshaastri devendra sharma ne hisaab lagaaya he ki agar dedh lakh tak kaa karza maaf kar diya jaae to is 11000 karod se 30 lakh kisaan karz mukt ho jaaenge
 a loan of one and a half million is on Ram Raj, he came to Lucknow to die, Nirav Modi went to New York with a lime of 11000 crores, went to Switzerland before which it is said that there is a house of black money, and he goes to Davos and Takes a photo with the Prime Minister
 hamane kisaanon se baat kii ki ve neerav modi ke is karaamaat yani chamatkaar par kya sochate hai
 In the press conference of 15 February, Ravi Shankar Prasad said that Nirav Modi did not accompany the Prime Minister, but was brought by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)
 magar jab aap google karenge to 2016 kii ek khabar milegi
 According to this news of Financial Express, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley went to Davos that year with 100 industrialists
 kai naam chape hai, ek naam neerav modi kaa bhi he
 On 13 January 2016, this news was released from the news agency PTI, which has been published by many newspapers
 16 farvari 2018 yani aaj ke times of india ke si unnikrishnan ne khabar likhi he ki 2016 ke saal main neerav modi ko 48 karod kii penalty deni padi thi kyonki disambar 2014 main 1000 karod kaa hira dikhaa kar smagaling kar rahe the
 The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, DRI served a case for two years, then had to pay a fine of 48 crores
 sawaal yah he ki itani badi chori ke baad kya diarai ne aage kii jaanch kii yaa sirf isi maamle tak khud ko simit rakhaa
 The case of smuggling continued, yet how the man went to Davos in 2016 with the Finance Minister
 sibiai jaanch shuru karne ja rahi thi phir yah neerav modi pradhanmantri modi ke saath photo frem main maujuud he
 Perhaps that's why Ravi Shankar Prasad was saying that there should be no politics of photos, so that people do not know
 wo jab press conference karne aae hi the to yah sab bataanaa chahie tha
 May not have gone with the Prime Minister, but who sent the goods worth 1000 crores out of theft to Davos with the Finance Minister, is it okay? neerav modi neuyark ke hotel main hai
 His shop has been raided in Delhi
 lekin unki dukaan to duniya ke kai deshon main he
 Are there raids too? aisi koi khabar suni he aapane? maamla kai companiyaan banaakar heere ke kaarobaar ke naam par paisa idhar se udhar karne kaa he
 Nothing will prove to be regretted because there must be a big event to end this news
 koi hangaamaa yaa koi bavaal
 Our colleague Namrata Brar went on the 36th floor of JW Marriott in New York and tried to get Nirav Modi to talk, put forward his case and not succeed
 godi media ne turant khabar likhnaa shuru kar diya ki 5000 karod baraamad ho gaye
 You have to understand this game
 maal zabt hua he, keemat tay hone main kai maheene se lekar saal lag jate hai
 You can ask any Income Tax Officer
 lekin yah bhi pataa chal rahaa he ki chaape kii team main jawaharaat ke export bhi hai jo saath kaa saath daam bhi bataa de rahe hai
 Whatever it is, the raid is on the shops of India, but the hotel where Nirav Modi is in has his another store in New York, there are shops in many countries of the world, are there raids too
 kya aapako isaki soochna he
 The dock media wrote that the money was recovered
 kya wo kaagaj bhi baraamad hua, kya un logon ke naam bhi baraamad ho gaye jinke saath milakar ye khel khelaa gaya he
 Raids have been conducted in 20 locations in six cities of India
 iskar vibhaag ne neerav modi kii company ke 21 khate sil kar die hai
 Nirav Modi's passport has been canceled
 hangaamaa hua tab radd hua
 The question was not answered as to how he escaped with his family on 1 January
 kya 1 janvari tak jaanch agency ko bilkul pataa nahin tha ki neerav modi ke yahaan chaape maarane kii taiyaari he
 On page 31 of the FIR dated January 31, it is clearly written and these are the words of the FIR which states that we request you to issue a look out notice against the names given above so that it does not leave the country
 The law could not do its work
 tab 30 janvari ko hi passport kyon nahin radd hua
 After so many days of relaxation, what will be done by Nirav Modi, how the documents will have disappeared, all this will never be known
 jab 2ji ghotaale main sab bari ho gaye, jaj saini ne kaha ki ve subah se shaam tak intazaar karte rah gaye magar sibiai saboot nahin pesh kar saki
 The case of agustawestland helicopter will be remembered
 italy kii adaalat main sibiai rishwatakhori ke saboot pesh nahin kar saki
 The accused escaped from the court there and no one discussed it here
 ye he hamaari agenciyon kaa ricard
 Seven people are named in the FIR
 neerav modi, ami neerav modi, nishaal modi, mehul chinubhai chaukasee, gokulanath shetty, manoj hanumant kharat, deputi manager pienbi or anya agyaat log, bank adhikari, pienbi
 It is alleged that the letter of undertaking was issued in a fake way, whose partners are Nirav Modi, Mr
 Nishaal Modi, Mr
 Ami Nirav Modi and Mr
 Mehul Chinubhai Chauksi
 2011 se shuru hone kii baat kahi ja rahi he magar exiaar main hi likhaa he ki 9
 02
 2017 ko 44 lakh dollar or 43 lakh dollar se zyaada kii rakam kii aloyu jari hui
 10
 2
 In 2017, lous amounting to $ 5
9 million and over $ 6 million were released
 14
 2
 2017 ko 58 lakh dollar se adhik kii rakam ke do aloyu jari hue
 While it is being said that it started from 2011, it should also be said that it continued till 2017, but tried to run till January 16, 2018, but Bhanda exploded
 indian express ne likhaa he ki 2011 se 2017 ke bich dedh sau letters aaf anderteking jari hui he
 The question may be important under whose rule the scam began, is it not important to whom that share of that money went
 inke koun koun kareebi hai
 The Indian Express has written that 17 banks are in the grip of this scam
 11,300 karod ke alaava 3000 karod kaa ghotaalaa hua he
 Nirav Modi is being discussed more, but the big player of this game is also Mehul Choksi
 vahi jiskaa naam ravishankar prasad thik se nahin le paa rahe the magar pradhanmantri thik se le rahe the
 The Prime Minister is addressing our Mehul Bhai, he is the same Mehul Bhai who is a partner of Nirav Modi
 in donon ke khilaaf mumbai police kamishnar se lekar banguluru police kamishnar se lekar vitt mantralay kii sabhi agenciyon ke paas kai baar shikaayat bheji ja chuki thi
 This complaint was being made since 2013
 phir bhi yah shaks 2015 main pradhanmantri ke sarkari kaarykram main unheen ke saamne maujuud he
 Do you think anything will ever happen
 paanch logon ne agar jaan jokhim main daalkar is maamle kii shikaayat na kii hoti to aaj is ghotaale kaa itihaas aasaani se dabaa diya jaataa
 These five people were those who were writing to every agency, listening to threats, complaining about life at stake
 agar tab sun liya gaya hota to punjab neshnal bank ko 11,300 karod kaa nuksaan na uthaanaa padataa
 Shikhar Jain, Vaibhav Khurania
 hari prasad, digvijay singh jadeja or santosh shrivastav
 These people wrote a lot of letters but despair came from everywhere
 baad main khud bhi hataash hone lage ki ab kuch nahin hoga
 Had Punjab National Bank not caught on January 16, it would not have been known that some people are fighting the battle by resigning from the Gitanjali Company
 is maamle main pehla patr 4 may 2015 ko dilli sthit SIFO yani sirius frod invastigeshan argenishen ko likhaa gaya
 On 6 May, the Mumbai Police Commissioner and all the Joint Police Commissioners were written
 isaki copy vitt mantralay, corporate mantralay, pravartan nideshaalay (idi), sibiai or aarthik aparaadh shakha dilli ko bhi bheji gai
 a copy of the complaint was sent to the Prime Minister's Office for the first time on 26 July 2016
 piemo ne turant hi is copy ko register of company ko patr bhej diya
 The Registrar of Companies comes under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs
 29 july 2016 ko in logon ne register of company ko phir patr likhaa
 Two months later, the Registrar of Companies replies that the matter has been closed
 bina kisi shikayatakarta se baat kiye register of company ne maamle ko kaise band kar diya
 Had the investigation been done honestly, Punjab National Bank would not have faced such a big scam
 ab aate hai congress banaam bijepi par
 Keep in mind one thing in the allegations of both
 sawaal or jawaab is maamle se sambandhit hai yaa nahin yaa phir daayen baayen aage peeche duusare tisare kisse bhi lapet liye gaye hai
 Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala asked five more questions and said that the scam has not been worth 11,300 crore but 21,306 crore
 sarkaar kii taraf se pehle din ravishankar prasad aae the, aaj maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar sahab aae
 He surrounded the Congress citing the statement of Allahabad Bank Director Dinesh Dubey
 dinesh doobe ne kaha he ki 2013 main un par dabaav daalaa gaya neerav modi ko karj dene ke liye to istipha de diya
 Said that Rahul Gandhi goes to Nirav Modi's exhibition
 uske baad elahabaad bank se neerav modi ko lone mil jaataa he
 This scam has been going on since the time of UPA
 kab shuru hua yah mahatvapurn he to yah bhi mahatvapurn hona chahie ki kab tak chalata rahaa
 How did Nirav Modi finally get eight fake letter of undertaking in February 2017? pradarshnee main rahul kaa janaa mahatvapurn he to neerav modi kaa pradhanmantri modi ke saath tasviir khinchaana bhi mahatvapurn hona chahie
 In this way, you prove the theory of Is equal to two in this game of Congress vs BJP
 agar congress baraabar bijepi sabit ho gaya to iskaa matlab ghotaalaa hua hi nahin tha
 The theory of Is equal to two in political science is my discovery, which i am thinking of getting a patent from the Jaypee University of Chhapra where students are unable to do a three-year BA even in six years
 vaise jhaavdekar ko yah bhi bataanaa chahie kaa endie kii sarkaar aane, unki sarkaar ke mantralayon se shikaayat karne ke baad bhi yah ghotaalaa kyon chalata rahaa, kyon register of company ne shikaayat karne waalon ko jawaab diya ki aapke maamalon ko band kiya jaataa he
 The comments prakaash jhaavdekar ne ek baat kahi
 Clean Bank Mission
 yah mishan kya he
 Under this mission on October 3, within one day, the broker institutions, banks and companies had to tell how much loan they had left
 kya aap jaanate hai ki us svachh bank mishan kaa kya hua? kya sabane ghoshnaa kii yaa phir is mishan ko bich main hi roak diya gaya kyonki isse sabakaa hisaab kitaab baahar aa jaataa or pole khul jaataa
 Lata Venkatesh has an article on Moneycontrol
com on 13 September 2017
 lata ji sienbisi kii editor ankar hai or banking sector kii export maani jaati hai
 He wrote that this caused panic among banks and companies but this step is revolutionary in itself
 kya 3 aktabur 2017 ko ek din ke bheetar sabhi companiyon or bainkon ne apni dendaree yani bakaae kii ghoshnaa kii
 According to our information, this cleanliness mission of banks suddenly disappeared
 ab daawa to nahin kar sakate kyonki ham is kshetra ke export nahin hai isliye aap bhi kisi bank adhikari se puch len
 Not only is everything known from the newspaper, some relatives also tell
 16 farvari ko punjab neshnal bank kaa share teen pratishat or gira
 After this scam, Punjab National Bank's stock has gone down in 52 weeks
 8 hazaar karod se zyaada iske shairdharakon ko nuksaan ho chukaa he

 After this scam, Punjab National Bank's stock has gone down in 52 weeks

 How the Registrar of Companies closed the case without talking to the complainant
 agar eemaandaaree se jaanch hui hoti to punjab neshnal bank ko itane bade ghotaale kaa saamana nahin karnaa padataa
 Now come on Congress vs BJP
 donon ke aarope pratyarope main ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhie
 The questions and answers are related to this matter or not or whether other third stories have been wrapped back and forth to the right
 congress ke pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne paanch sawaal or puche or kaha ki yah ghotaalaa 11300 karod kaa nahin balki 21,306 karod kaa ho gaya he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad came from the government on the first day, today HRD minister Prakash Javadekar saheb came
 unhone elahabaad bank ke nideshak dinesh doobe ke bayaan ke hawaale se congress ko gheraa
 Dinesh Dubey has said that Nirav who was pressurized in 2013, resigned to give loan to Modi
 kaha ki rahul gandhi neerav modi kii pradarshnee main jate hai
 After that, Nirav Modi gets a loan from Allahabad Bank
 yah ghotaalaa upie ke samay se chal rahaa he
 When it started it is important, so it should also be important how long it lasted
 aakhir farvari 2017 main aath jaali letters of anderteking kaise mil gaya neerav modi ko
 It is important for Rahul to go to the exhibition, then it should also be important for Nirav Modi to be photographed with Prime Minister Modi
 is tarah aap congress banaam bijepi ke is khel main iz ikval tu kii theory ko sabit kar dete hai
 If the Congress proved to be an equal BJP, it did not mean a scam
 polytical science main ij ikval tu kii theory meri khoj he jise chhapra ke jepi uniwarsity se patent karaane kii soch rahaa hum jahaan chaatr teen saal kaa bie chah saal main bhi nahin kar pate hai
 By the way, Jawadekar should also explain why this scam continued even after the NDA government came and complained to his government's ministries, why the Registrar of Companies responded to the complainants that your cases are closed
 tippaniyan Prakash Jhavadekar said one thing
 svachh bank mishan kii
 What is this mission 3 aktubar ko is mishan ke tahat ek din ke bheetar brokar sansthaaon, bank or companiyon ko bataanaa tha ki unke paas kitna lone baaki he
 Do you know what happened to that clean bank mission? Did everyone announce or was this mission stopped in the middle because it would have brought out the book and opened the pole for everyone
 13 sitambar 2017 ko manicontrol daat kaam par lata venkatesh kaa is par lekh he
 Lata ji is the editor anchor of CNBC and is considered an expert in the banking sector

 Can't claim now because we are not experts in this field, so you should also ask any bank officer

 On February 16, Punjab National Bank's stock fell three percent
 is ghotaale ke baad punjab neshnal bank kaa share 52 saptaah main sabase neeche chalaa gaya he
 Its shareholders have lost more than 8000 crores
 sarkaar kii taraf se pehle din ravishankar prasad aae the, aaj maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar sahab aae
 He surrounded the Congress citing the statement of Allahabad Bank Director Dinesh Dubey
 dinesh doobe ne kaha he ki 2013 main un par dabaav daalaa gaya neerav modi ko karj dene ke liye to istipha de diya
 Said that Rahul Gandhi goes to Nirav Modi's exhibition
 uske baad elahabaad bank se neerav modi ko lone mil jaataa he
 This scam has been going on since the time of UPA
 kab shuru hua yah mahatvapurn he to yah bhi mahatvapurn hona chahie ki kab tak chalata rahaa
 How did Nirav Modi finally get eight fake letter of undertaking in February 2017? pradarshnee main rahul kaa janaa mahatvapurn he to neerav modi kaa pradhanmantri modi ke saath tasviir khinchaana bhi mahatvapurn hona chahie
 In this way, you prove the theory of Is equal to two in this game of Congress vs BJP
 agar congress baraabar bijepi sabit ho gaya to iskaa matlab ghotaalaa hua hi nahin tha
 The theory of Is equal to two in political science is my discovery, which i am thinking of getting a patent from the Jaypee University of Chhapra where students are unable to do a three-year BA even in six years
 vaise jhaavdekar ko yah bhi bataanaa chahie kaa endie kii sarkaar aane, unki sarkaar ke mantralayon se shikaayat karne ke baad bhi yah ghotaalaa kyon chalata rahaa, kyon register of company ne shikaayat karne waalon ko jawaab diya ki aapke maamalon ko band kiya jaataa he
 The comments prakaash jhaavdekar ne ek baat kahi
 Clean Bank Mission

 2014 kaa aam chunaav khatm ho gaya
 
 har jagah bas ek hi charchaa he, kya bijepi akele apane dam par bahumat hasil kar paaegi yaa phir endie ke boote sarkaar banaaegi
 Will the Congress be reduced to two digits and the UPA clan will be able to cross the hundred mark with great difficulty, but one thing is being discussed between neither the media nor the parties
 wo ye ki is chunaav ko karwaane ke liye kareeb 50 se zyada javaanon ne apni jaan ganvaai
 26 CRPF jawans alone were martyred while on duty duty
 itnaa hi nahin akele isi bal ke kareeb 35 jawan ghayal bhi hue hai
 It seems that the fault of these soldiers is that they wanted to have clean elections in the country
 aisa pehali baar hua he jab chunaav ke dauraan itani badi tadaad main jawan maare gaye hai
 Earlier, two died during the 2004 general elections and six in 2009
 baavjood iske javaanon ke hausale kam nahin hue
 This time 127 ieds, 52 weapons, 452 ammunition and 807 kg explosives were seized
 or to or 52 dfa se zyada encounter bhi hue
 Hardly anyone knows that on election day or about its preparations, these soldiers have walked 40 to 50 kilometers from morning to evening
 jangal se lekar pahaad tak main inaki madad ke bagaiyr chunaav ho paanaa namumican tha, is baat se bekhbar hokar kii maut unka peechha kar rahi he
 Many times it happened that the soldier is lying on the road with injuries, but the helicopter arrived after hours to take him to the hospital
 ise lekar jab hamane aalaa adhikariyon se baat kii to pataa chalaa ki ve chaahakar bhi javaanon kii madad ke liye turant helicopter nahin bhej sakate the
 Because before that they had to siege the whole area so that the Naxalites would not fire
 iske alaava kagaji karrwai main bhi deree to ho hi jaati he, vaise bhi ye jawan narendra modi yaa rahul gandhi to hai nahin jinke liye ek nahin kai helicopter choubison ghante uplabdh rahata he
 Today these jawans are complaining, no one wins the elections, but do not forget their bravery and sacrifice
 kyonki loktantr ko bachaae rakhane ke liye unhone jo shahadat di he, usase badi qurbaani kuch or nahin ho sakati

 No matter how good a child is at reading, but with the examination, their tension increases
 is dauraan na keval bacchon kii tension bad jaati he balki unke parents bhi kaaphi pareshaan ho jate hai
 On the one hand, while trying to keep the child away from pressure and tension, the food should be taken care of
 is dauraan bachche ko poshak tatwon se bharpoor chijen hi deni chahie
 a good amount of vitamins, proteins and salts are needed in the child's diet
 saath hi unhen taral ke rup main doodh dena bhi ek behatar vikalp he
 Milk is a complete diet and it helps in improving mental health of children
 international deyari jarnal main prakashit ek adhyayan ke anusaar, roj kam se kam ek gilaas doodh pine se na sirf bacchon ko pramukh poshak tatv praapt hote hai balki yah unki yaaddaasht ko bhi durust rakhane main madadgaar he
 Dietician and nutritionist Tanya Joshi of Freshman's Valley also believes that it is important for children to drink milk because it boosts their physical and mental development
 bacchon ke liye doodh pine ke phaayde:1
 Milk contains 16 different essential nutrients
 ye poshak tatv maansik or shaareerik swasthya ko behatar banane kaa kaam karata he
 The calcium, protein, vitamin D, vitamin B12, magnesium, potassium and anti-oxidants present in milk are very beneficial for the baby
 2
 Consuming high levels of dairy products improves children's working memory and thinking
 3

 At least 12 people are feared dead in the rain and landslides in Gajapati district, while four people are said to be missing
 shanivaar ko vishesh raahat ayukta beepi sethi ne bataaya ki yah ghatana us samay hui, jab shuukravaar shaam baari barish ke baad kuch graminon ne ek guphanuma jagah main sharan lee thi
 Earlier, cyclonic storm Titlias killed 8 people including 2 women in Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh

 Sethi said that after getting the report, financial assistance will be provided to the affected people as per government provisions
 adhikari ne bataaya ki lagaataar barish se prabhavit ilaake memrashtriya aapadaa mochan bal (ndrf)ke karmiyon sahit ek bachaav dal ko bheja gaya he
 The landslide occurred due to the cyclone on Thursday, southwest of Gopalpur, near Palsa

 After reviewing the situation, Chief Minister of Odisha Naveen Patnaik will now conduct an aerial survey of some of the affected areas including Ganjam, Gajapati and Rayagada districts
 is varsh kii shuruyaat main satta par kabiz hui sarkaar kaa dijal par sabsidi khatm karne kaa saahsee faisla kya bazaar ke sameekaran ko badal degaa? pichley chand varshon ke dauraan bhartiya car bazaar dijal vaali kaaron ke paksh main jhukaa rahaa he
 Is there any effect on your choice of cars? Buying a diesel engine car has been a smart decision for the last several years
 itnaa hi nahin, honda cars india limited jaisi companiyon ne apane bede main dijal kaaron ko shaamil kar ke jamkar munafa batora he
 Barring entry-level vehicles, it showed in most categories that if a model also had a diesel version, it was selling at around 80 per cent
 sarkaar ke dijal kii keemat ko niyantrit rakhane kii vajah se bazaar main is tarah ke asaamaanya halaat paidaa hue
 But with the end of government subsidy on diesel, all is going to change very soon
 kareeb do saal pehle petrol or dijal kii keemat main prati litre antar 30 ru
 Was
 aaj yah fark keval 10 ru
 Whereas, the reality is that preparing diesel by refining crude oil is more expensive than petrol
 aane vaale maheenon main petrol or dijal kii keemten ek duusare ke or kareeb aa jaaen to hairaani nahin honi chahie
 If we talk about the experiences of developed countries, then it is possible that the price of petrol will be reduced in comparison to diesel
 aise halaat main bhi kya dijal kii car khareednaa budhimatta kaa kaam he? yah sahi he ki petrol ingine ke mukaable dijal ingine swaabhaavik rup se zyada milage dete hai, lekin yah bhi yaad rakhana chahie ki dijal ingine banane main adhik kharch aata he
 Not only this, its maintenance is also more expensive
 dijal kaaron ke shuruaati model main bhi zyada tork ke kaaran driving kaa ek alag majaa mil jaataa he, jabaki yahi khubi petrol ke top and model main milti he
 Nevertheless, at least in our country, victory will be that of the least expensive
 apni baat ko behatar tareeke se samajhane ke liye main alag-alag segment kii teen kaaron kaa udhaaharan duungaa
 The Volkswagen Polo and Honda Mobilio have a normal petrol engine while the Skoda Octavia has a direct injection turbo charged petrol engine
 in petrol ingine ko banane main dijal ingine jitna hi kharch aata he or ye driving ke dauraan petrol or dijal ingine, donon kaa majaa dete hai
 They have higher output, so even smaller cars can be used in larger cars
 tel kii maujuuda keemton ke aadhaar par baat karen to agar koi har maah kam-se-kam 3,000 kimi kii duuri tay karata he to vah dijal or petrol polo main se inhen chun saktaa he
 Diesel Mobilio will be better for those who drive about 2,000 km per month and diesel octavia than petrol for about 5,000 km per month
 agar donon eendhanon kii keemten ek samaan ho jaaen, jisaki sambhaavna agle saal dikh rahi he, to puraa paisa vasuulne ke lihaaj se apekshit milage or adhik ho jayega
 About 4,500 km for Polo, 2,500 km for Mobilo and more than 7,000 km for Octavia Diesel
 ye aankade legal riquirements ke maddenjar manuphaccrers kii ore se ghoshit ful iconomi figars se liye gaye hai
 Figures can vary from how the cars are used

 Ishant justified captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's decision to bowl by winning the toss on the greenery pitch of Basin Reserve and forced the batsmen of the hosts to kneel with their line and length
 bharat ke pehle din dabadabe bhare pradarshan main mohammad shami (70 ran dekar chaar wicket) ne bhi acha yogadan diya, unhone ahm maukon par ken williamsan (47) or padaarpan kar rahe james nisham (33) ke wicket jatke
 Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan played an aggressive unbeaten half-century, helping India to 100 for two at stumps, with the team still trailing by 92 runs
 bharat ne salaami ballebaaj murali vijay (2) or cheteshwar pujaara (19) ke wicket saste main ganvaa die, jiske baad dhawan (naabad 71 ran) or raatri prahari ishanth teen ran banaakar khel rahe hai
 Ishant continued his impressive run in the first Test, picking up five wickets for the second time in the series and a fifth time in his 55th Test
 ishanth ne apane subah ke spel ke pehle chaar over main hi teen wicket jhatak liye the, jisase bharat ke safal din kii neenv rakhi gai
 New Zealand, leading 1-0 in the series, also faltered in the second innings of the first Test, which means that the Indian bowlers have taken a lot of kiwi batting in the last two innings
 haalanki is puure daure ke dauraan bharat kaa pradarshan bahut kharaab rahaa he
 Although Indian team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has won all the tosses in this series, but has not won a single match

 Elections are being held in Uttar Pradesh, the eyes of the entire country are set on UP
 lekin sabase hairat kii baat ye he ki bijepi ke kendriya netritv ne bihar bijepi ke ek bhi netaa ko is kaabil nahin samajha jo upi chunaav ke star prachaarkon ke list main shaamil ho sake
 Not a single leader of the Bihar BJP is included in the list released by the central leadership of the BJP
 lok janashakti party ke rashtriya adhyaksh or kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan kaa naam us suchi main jarur shaamil he jabaki hindustan avam morcha ke rashtriya adhyaksh or purv mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi kaa naam bhi us suchi main nahin he
 Elections are going on in the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh, but the BJP leaders of Bihar are sitting hand in hand
 unhen koi puch hi nahin rahaa
 In the list of 40 star campaigners by the central leadership of the BJP, there is not a single leader of Bihar BJP, whereas the politics of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh is not very different
 khaskar bihar se sate ilaakon main tobihar bijepi netaaon kaa acha khaasaa prabhaavahai lekin kendriya netritv ne inke prabhaav ko vishesh mahatv nahin diya
 The leaders of Bihar BJP are feeling insulted for not getting a place in the list of star campaigners for the election campaign
 bihar bijepi ke sabase bade chehre or pichley chunaav main bihar ke mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar susheel kumaar modi is sawaal par muskuraate hai lekin usamen bhi dard chipa hai
 He, however, handled the matter and said that it is not necessary to be in the list of star campaigners to promote
 sabhi netaa bihar se sate seemaayi ilaakon main prachaar karne jaayenge
 Bihar out of UP election! Only bjp's star campaigners in UP have Ram Vilas Paswan of Bihar
 is suchi se yah to spasht ho gaya ki bijepi ke kendriya netritv ke saamne bihar bijepi netaaon kii haisiyat kya he
 JDU, which was once with BJP, did not forget to make fun of BJP on this question
 bihar main sattadharijediu ne aakhri vakt par khud ko upi chunaav ladane se alag kar liya
 Party spokesperson Neeraj Kumar attacked Bihar BJP leaders, saying that the central leadership of the BJP has questioned the DNA of Bihar BJP leaders
 baharhaal uttar pradesh ke chunaav main bihar ke netaaon kii is baar koi upasthiti nahin rahegi
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's party JDU is not contesting there, he will not go for campaigning either
 lalu yadav kii party argedy chunaav nahin lard rahi he lekin rashtriya adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav samaajawaadee party ke liye chunaav prachaar main jaayenge
 On the other hand, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan is also not happy despite being included in the list of star campaigners as he was not even consulted about the ticket

 puraanon main dhanteras kii puja ko behad kalyankari bataaya gaya he
 It is also called Dhan Trayodashi
 dhanavantari or dhan ke devtaa kuber kii puja ke alaava aaj ke din maa lakshmi kaa pujan karne kii bhi manyata he
 There is also a legend about this day
 dhanteras kii katha ke anusaarek samay bhagwaan vishnu mrityulok main vicharan karne ke liye aa rahe the tab lakshmi ne bhi unke saath chalane kaa aagrah kiya
 Vishnu said that if you believe what i say to you, then you can walk with me
 lakshmi unki baat maan gayi or bhagwaan vishnu ke saath dharti par aa gayi
 After some time, Lord Vishnu reached a place and said to Lakshmiji that you stay here till i come
 main dakshin disha kii ore ja rahaa hum, tum udhar mat aana
 After Vishnuji left, Kautuhl woke up in the mind of Lakshmi that what is the secret that i have been denied in the south direction and God himself went away
 lakshmi se rahaa na gaya or jaise hi bhagwaan aage bade lakshmi bhi peeche-peeche chal padin
 After going a little further, he saw a mustard field which had lots of flowers
 sarson kii shobhaa dekhakar vah mantrmugdh ho gayi or phool todakar apana shringaar karne ke baad aage badhin
 On going further, Laxmiji broke sugarcane from a sugarcane field and started sucking juice
 usee kshan vishnu ji aae or yah dekh lakshmi par naaraaz hokar unhen shaap de diya ki maine tumhen idhar aane ko manaa kiya tha, par tum na maani or kisaan kii chori kaa aparaadh kar baithi
 Now you should serve this farmer for 12 years in the crime of this crime
 aisa kahkar bhagwaan unhen chhodkar kshirsagar chale gaye
 Laxmiji started living in the house of that poor farmer
 ek din lakshmi ne us kisaan kii patni se kaha ki tum snaan kar pehle meri banaai gai is devilakshmi kaa pujanakaro, phir rasoi bananaa, tab tum jo maangogi milegaa
 The farmer's wife did the same
 puja ke prabhaav or lakshmi kii krupa se kisaan kaa ghar duusare hi din se ann, dhan, ratna, swarna aadi se bhar gaya
 Lakshmi completed the farmer with money
 kisaan ke 12 varsh bade anand se cat gaye
 Then after 12 years Laxmiji agreed to go
 vishnuji lakshmi ko lene aae to kisaan ne unhen bhejne se inkaar kar diya
 Then God told the farmer that who let them go, they are fickle, they do not stay anywhere
 inako bade-bade nahin roak sake
 He was cursed by me so was serving you for 12 years
 tumhaari 12 varsh seva kaa samay puraa ho chukaa he
 The farmer stubbornly said, no, i will not let Laxmiji go now
 tab lakshmi ne kaha ki he kisaan tum mujhe rokna chaahate ho to jo main kahuun vaisaa karo
 Tomorrow is thirteen
 tum kal ghar ko lip-potkar svachh karnaa
 Burning ghee Kadipak at night and worshiping me in the evening and keeping a rupee in a copper vase for me, i will reside in that vase
 kintu puja ke samay main tumhen dikhaai nahin duungi
 With this one day worship, i will not leave your house for the whole year
 yah kahkar vah dipakon ke prakaash ke saath dason dishaao main fail gayi
 The next day the farmer worshiped according to the dictates of Laxmiji
 uskaa ghar dhan-dhaany se purna ho gaya
 Because of this, Lakshmi ji started worshiping every year on Teres day

 On the completion of one year of demonetisation, special veterans of Indian industry attended the special session of Aaj Tak Conclave
 notebandi ke phaayde or nuksaan par charchaa karne ke liye is khaas satr main riel estate diggaj dlef ke siio rajeev talwaar, i-commers site shopaklooj ke siio sanjay sethi, mobiquik ke siio bipin preet singh or sukaam power system ke emdi kunwar singh shaamil hue
 The session was conducted by Rahul Kanwal along with Rajiv Dubey
 rajeev talwaar ke mutabik i-monetigeshan se koi company band nahin hui he
 The Real Estate Regulation Act is in place
 supreme court kharidaaron ke hit ke liye faisla de rahi he
 According to Talwar, the biggest challenge for people to buy a house after demonetisation is how to collect the cash
 yadi aaj bhi use ghar kharidne main apane pement kaa bada hissaa cash main dena he to use cash ekatra karne kaa rasta dekhnaa hoga
 Therefore, it is still possible to buy cash in real estate for those who are able to arrange cash for themselves
 talbaar ke mutabik, real estate main keemten giri hai lekin sarkal rate ke mutabik keemten abhi bhi bazaar kii keemat se upar he
 Therefore, to fix real estate, it is very important that now the circular rate is also cut by about 25-30%
 sanjay sethi ne bataaya ki cash on delivery mennotebandi ke elaan ke badagiravat darj hui thi
 But currently we have reached the same level of Cash on Delivery once again
 aisi sthiti main jinav kaise badla he
 Sanjay said that a lot has changed in the country since Notambadi
 lekin mahaj notebandi se kya badlaav hua par sanjay ne kaha ki isse koi khaas badlaav dekhne ko nahin mila he
 Bipin Preet Singh said that the biggest benefit and change after demonetisation is that it has made the government open all its departments for digital payment
 vahiin notebandi se pehle sarkari vibhaagon main sirf cash or check kaa bolbalaa tha
 Bipin said that before the ban on demonetisation, only the POS machine used in the country has increased 5 times
 isse saaf he ki desh main zyada dukaane digital pement lene ke liye taiyaar hai
 According to Bipin, to this day, small businesses are not refusing to take digital payments, whereas cash was completely preferred before demonetisation
 kunwar singh- kunwar ke mutabik notebandi ke elaan ke baad lagbhag 2 maheene tak unka bijness puri tarah se thapp pad gaya
 At the same time, after two months, when things started getting a little bit from 1 July, GST was implemented in the whole country
 kunwar ke mutabiknodambdi ke tunrat baad jahaan unke contractorske saamne pement kii badi chunauti thi vahiin ab sthiti thodi saamaanya hone ke baad vah ek baar phir cash kaa rukh kar chuke hai
 Kunwar said that the biggest challenge in digital payment is that there is a transaction cut of 2 per cent
 lihaaja, koi bhi kaarobaari yaa graahak apane paise se is cat ko dena nahin chahega
 According to Kunwar, if there were 100 incidents of tax evasion after demonetisation, today it has come down to 70

 The state of politics has been laid in Delhi
 ek chor par aam aadmi party ke arvind kejariwal hai to duusari par bijepi kii kiran bedi
 Both are descended from the Anna movement against corruption
 lekin in sab ke bich donon ke 'guru'anna hajaareunaki raajnneetik pari se bahut zyada khush najar nahin aa rahe hai
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Anna refused to speak anything about Bedi, while saying that both of them have come out of the movement and one will become CM so he is happy
 anna ne modi sarkaar par bhrashtachar ke khilaaf udaseenta kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki vah march-april main phir se andolan karenge
 Anna said that Arvind Kejriwal has forgotten him after joining politics and never met him apart from Maharashtra Sadan
 anna ne kaha ki kiran bedi ne unase kabhi baat nahin kii or isliye vah donon ke bare main kuch bhi nahin kahana chaahate
 Anna said that after becoming Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal never remembered him and he only cared about power
 ek jaisi he modi or manmohan sarkarabhrashtachar ke mudde par narendra modi sarkaar ko aade haathon lete hue anna ne kaha ki aath maheene biit gaye hai, lekin sarkaar is mudde par maun he
 The government is also indifferent to the issue of land acquisition and black money
 bijepi ne vaada kiya tha ki har aadmi ke acount main 15 lakh aaenge, 15 paise tak nahin aae
 Anna said, 'corruption was at its peak during the tenure of the Congress government
 isi kaaran vah satta main waapas nahin ai
 Today, duplicate ombudsmen have been created in the states
 agar sarkaar kii marji se lokapal banataa he to vah kisi kaam kaa nahin he
 Anna said that 5 anti-corruption bills are stuck, but the government is not taking any care
 dilli soch-samajhakar vot karshanna ne dilli ke matadaataaon se apil kii he ki vah soch-samajhakar vot karen
 Anna said, 'whose man are you voting for? isse pehle yah dekhen ki kis party ko vot de rahe hai

 This area is very important for its maritime trade, because 80 percent of the country's energy supply means about 38 daily

 To safeguard this area to a large extent, the Navy has been demanding 25 per cent of the defense budget for aircraft, warships and submarines for years, while still getting 17 per cent
 nausena ke yojanakaar is atkal ko khaarij karte hai ki is maang ke peeche makasad dakshin china sagar main janaa he

 The Indian Navy is basically dependent on a fleet of conventional diesel-electric submarines

 If a fleet of four such submarines goes out on patrol, it can shut down India's energy supply, cut off the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and pose a threat to INS Vikramaditya's fleet

 Naval observers were well aware of the three-stage military expansion strategy of Admiral Lu Hua King, the naval chief of the PLA in the late 1980s

 After this, the Chinese Navy decided to do this work more quickly
 samudri dakaiti rokane kii aad main usne 2008 se adan kii khadi main apane vyapaarik jahaajon or navikon kii suraksha ke liye yudhpot tainaat kar rakhe hai
 An Indian admiral told India Today late last year, "the piracy problem has become a huge opportunity for China
 ab ve kisi na kisi bahaane par apni tainaati karte rahenge
 "joshi's successor is absent
 It is no surprise that there is confusion in the Indian Naval Headquarters in South Block rather than anger

 Everything in the water months before the INS Indus Guard burst into Mumbai Harbor, the Navy proposed to extend the lifespan of its fleet of 14 submarines
 is tarah kii marammat se puraani pandubbiyon kii umr saat saal bad jaaegi
 The average lifespan of a submarine is 25 years, but the plan has not yet been approved
 agar manjuuri mil jaae to bhi laabh nahin hoga
 The improved submarine will operate 10 days a month, while the new submarine is available for 20 days
 nausena ke paas nai pandubbiyaan nahin hai
 Six Scorpene submarines purchased from France in 2005 were to join the fleet in 2012, but officials delayed financial approval so much that the matter is now deferred until at least 2017
 bedaa chota ho jane se karmchaaree bad gaye hai
 If a decade ago there were 150 officers on 12 submarines, today there are 700 officers on seven submarines
 pandubbi chaalkon ko samudr main kam samay miltaa he, jisase unki training or kushalta par ulataa asar pad rahaa he
 Not only this, it may be that these concerns have missed the danger of rising from China and some degree of indifference
 iske vipareet china duniya main sabase bada sainya vistaar kar rahaa he
 Last week itself, he raised his defense budget to 12 from last year's $ 40 billion
 2 fisadi badhaayaa he, jabaki vaastavik bajet shaayad 40 fisadi zyada hoga
 This would, among other things, create a fleet of more than 20 nuclear-powered assault submarines
 idhar bharat is saal raksha mad main 6 arab dollar kharch karegaa
 Yet some people in India's defense establishment are not worried

 He is struggling with a three-decade-old plan to land a small squadron of three 6,000-tonne indigenous nuclear-powered submarines equipped with nuclear missiles
 pehali pandubbi arihant 2009 main taiyaar hui thi, lekin abhi samudri aajamaaish nahin hui he
 The government has not yet approved the 2010 confidential proposal of the Navy to build a fleet of four submarines, such as the Shang class SSN
 is bich nausena nai paramparaagat pandubbiyaan paane ke liye jor laga rahi he
 Topping its list are six Project 75 India submarines
 3,000 karod ru
 These submarines are larger than the Scorpion
 bhale hi chini esesain ke saamne unki upyogita simit he
 The Finance Ministry has blocked the proposal citing the cost as too much
 nausena ko kul milakar 76,000 karod ru
 To include 24 conventional submarines in its fleet at a cost of Rs
 rier admiral menon jaise jaankaron ko usamen koi tuk najar nahin aati
 They say the Navy should abandon traditional submarines and become a full-fledged nuclear-powered naval force like the US, France and Britain
 lekin is bare main nausena kya soch rahi he? ek nausainik adhikari kaa kahana he ki hind mahaasaagar main badalata samrik maahaul ek or parmaanu shakti chaalit hamalavar pandubbi patte par lene ke liye majaboor kar saktaa he
 It is a more clever solution to another strategic problem
 lekin desh is samay chunaav ke mod main ja chukaa he
 When the government is not even able to deploy the new naval chief, he hardly takes any such decision in the time of the code of conduct
 maujuuda rajnatik maahaul main agar desh main sarkaar badalati he to use bhi jamane or bade faisle lene main kuch vakt to lagegaa hi

 Congress leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, alleging that there was a scam of Rs 1 lakh 30 thousand crore in the Rafale deal, said that this calculation is based on the data given in a statement by Reliance Defense, the offset partner of this deal
 rafel deal se sambandhit muddon par niyam-193 ke tahat congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi dwaara pichley 2 janvari ko shuru kii gai charchaa main shuukravaar ko bhaag lete hue khadge ne sarkaar par supreme court main kaig report sambandhi jhootha halafanama dene kaa aarope lagaaya

 is dauraan sadan main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi bhi upasthit rahe

 baad main 2017 main daso kii ek vijyapti ke aadhaar par vimaan kii badi hui keemat 1670 karod rupee saamne ai
 Kharge said that once the government has told the price of the aircraft in the Lok Sabha in response to a question, what is the harm in telling the increased price? Now why is the government talking about a confidentiality agreement? He said that the answer to all these questions can only be found from the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC)

 In our homes, we make three such mistakes every day, which take away the nutrition from which we do not know what to do! 1
 kaatane ke baad subjiyon ko dhonakya he dikkat:aisa karne se pani ke saath ghulne vaale poshak tatv ham kho dete hai
 These may include vitamin B, vitamin C, sodium, and potassium
 kya karnaa saheehsubgiyon ko kuch vakt ke liye pani main bhigo len
 After that dry and then cut
 2
 What is cooking more? When vegetables are boiled or cooked excessively, only the carbohydrates and fat remain
 vitamin aanch nahin sah pate
 What to do: The best way to prepare vegetables is to boil them
 3
 It is difficult to drink water while eating, because it reduces the strength of the fluids that help to digest in the body
 saath hi poshak tatwon ke sharir tak pahunchane kaa rasta bhi rukta he
 Doing so can cause acid reflex and heartburn
