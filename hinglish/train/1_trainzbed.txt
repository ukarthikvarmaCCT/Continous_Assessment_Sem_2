 Expressing serious concern over the high rate of dropout of children in the middle, HRD Minister Kapil Sibal said on Wednesday that the public and private sector partnership in the development of school and higher education was encouraged keeping this in mind
 It will be known that its purpose is not just to earn profit
 shiksha kii gunvattta ko behatar banane ke liye shiksha or shikshan ke swaroop main amulchul badlaav par jor dete hue sibbal ne shikshakon se padhai ko sahabhaagitapurna banane ko kaha
 He, however, dismissed any possibility of abolishing the 12th board
 shiksha ke kshetra main sudhaar par fikki dwaara yojit sangoshtee main sibbal ne yahaan kaha ‘aaj jab ham bharat ko 21veen sadi main le jane kii baat karte hai us samay hamaare samaksh sabase badi samasya bacchon kii schuli shiksha se judi he
 In this too, the high rate of dropout of children is a matter of serious concern
 ’unhone kaha ‘aaj jahaan kareeb 22 karod bachche skool jate hai, us samay vishesh taur par madhyamik str par skulon main chaatro ke skool chhodane kii dar 49 pratishat he
 The biggest challenge before us is how to prevent the tendency of children to drop out of education
 ’ maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri ne kaha ‘is uddeshy ke liye ham saarvajanik-nijee sahabhaagita badhaane or nijee kshetra ko nivesh ke liye protsaahit karne ke paksh main he, lekin is nivesh kaa makasad keval munafa kamanaa nahin hoga
 "sibal said that investment in education sector will be encouraged by the private sector, but it will be ensured that profits are not withdrawn like the stock market
" desh main shiksha ke vikaas ke liye gyaan aadhaarit sampada ke srijan par jor dete hue sibbal ne kaha ‘ham college or vishvavidhyalay str kii shiksha ko ‘shodh’ aadhaarit bananaa chaahate he kyonki shodh se hi gyaan aadhaarit sampada kaa srijan ho saktaa he
 He said that a meeting between university chancellors and publicists was held for this purpose and universities have been asked to explore the possibility of including schools in research programs
 mantri ne kaha ki muft evam anivaary shiksha adhinium banaaya ja chukaa he lekin abhi tak ise adhishuchet nahin kiya ja sakaa he, haalanki chaatro ke skool chhodane kii samasyaon ke maddenjar artii ke daayre ke tahat madhyamik str ke bacchon ko laane kaa prayaas kiya jaayegaa
 Sibal said, "this is a big challenge and cannot be completed today or tomorrow because only 2 out of 22 crore children going to school
 60 karod bachche hi college str tak pahunch pate hai jabaki 19 karod bachche college nahin ja pate hai
 Lack of schools is also a major problem
 ’ sibbal ne kaha ‘hamaara uddeshy yah he ki college or vishvavidhyalay shodhakarya ko aage badhate hue sthaneey samudaay kii samasyaon ko dur karne ke upaae par bhi kaam karen
 He said that the nature of our education should be such that employment can be ensured through it
 ’ sibbal ne kaha ki shiksha ke moulik adhikaar banane, sarv shiksha abhiyaan, ucch shiksha anusandhan ayog, shaikshik kadachaar rokane kaa kanoon, shiksha ke kshetra main saarvajanik-nijee saajheedaari, kapirite kanoon ko kargaar banane ke kaam ko aage badhaayaa gaya he
 He said that the government is in the process of setting up primary schools and completing the task of creating additional classrooms under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan
 mantri ne kaha ‘skulon ke liye swatantra sambhddhata nikaay, shiksha panchat gathit karne se sambandhit vidhyek ko ucch adhikaar praapt mantriyon ke samooh (jioem) se manjuuri mil gai he haalanki shaikshik kadachaar rokane ke liye kanoon banane kaa vidheyak abhi jioem ke samaksh he
 ' uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri ramesh pokharial nishank ne rajya main eco tourism nigam ko gathit kiye jane par siddhantat: apni sahmati pradaan kar di he
 Official sources said that in a high-level meeting of the secretary-level officials, the Chief Minister gave in-principle agreement on the formation of the corporation and said that the state's income would have to be increased by using 100 percent capacity of the administrative machinery
 unhone kaha ki aam aadmi par kisi prakaar kaa nayaa aarthik boj nahin ladaa jaayegaa
 Giving his consent to the formation of Eco Tourism Corporation by the Forest Department as a joint venture of Tourism and Forest Department, he said that a detailed proposal should be brought in this regard
 nishank ne kaha ki wanon ke paas sthit gaanvon main shauchalay nirmaan tathaa junglee jaanwaron se suraksha ke liye taar bad lagaaya jaaya chaiye
 The forest department can take income tax exemption in such works

 At the same time, defending the decision to abolish Article 370, Madhav said that the 'deliberate' decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not be rescinded, because it is done for the good of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, which is a part of this constitutional provision
 In the guise, he was deprived of his various rights for the last 70 years
 bhaajapa netaa ne ‘vilay diwas' par party dwaara yojit ek seminar ke maukey par kaha, ‘ghati main gadabadi paidaa karne kaa pakistan kaa prayaas jari he, lekin hamaare suraksha bal uske sabhi prayaason ko naakaam kar denge
 He said that when asked about repeated violations of the ceasefire by Pakistan, he said that necessary security arrangements have been made to thwart attempts to create disturbances in the valley
 madhav ne seminar ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki aatankwaadi rajya main baahar se vyapaariyon or trek chaalkon ko nishaanaa banaakar ‘kashmiriat kii khubsuurati' ko nasht kar rahe hai, lekin suraksha bal aisi gatividhiyon ko lekar unke saath sakhti se niptenge
 He said, "the terrorists are trying to intimidate the businessmen who came for business in Jammu and Kashmir
 ve keval kashmir ke logon ke hiton ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahe hai or kashmiriat ko nasht kar rahe hai
 He congratulated the people of Jammu and Kashmir on the eve of Deepawali festival and said that this would be the first Diwali after the removal of Article 370, which led to the complete integration of Jammu and Kashmir with India
 unhone kaha, ‘yah modi ke netritv main bhaajapa dwaara liya gaya ek suvichaarit faisla tha
 The verdict was not based on political thought or ideology but to restore various rights to the people of Jammu and Kashmir, who were denied political, fundamental and democratic rights as well as the right to dignity for the last seven decades

 This is due to Manjhi's direct refusal by party president Sharad Yadav and senior leader Nitish Kumar seeking his resignation
 party adhyaksh sharad yadav ne shanivaar ko patna main vidhayak dal kii baithak bulaai he
 At the same time, the Chief Minister has called it illegal to call such a meeting
 unka kahana he ki aisi baithak bulaane kaa haq mukhyamantri ko he
 The meeting is expected to be rude
 haalanki is baithak kaa agenda filhal kuch bhi tay nahin mana ja rahaa he, lekin samajha ja rahaa he ki is baithak main maanjhi ko hataane ke alaava nae netaa ke rup main nitish kumaar se kaman sanbhaalane kaa anurodh kiya jayega
 According to party sources, National President Sharad Yadav first sought Manjhi's resignation, but Manjhi made it clear that this demand should come from Nitish Kumar
 tab sharad yadav ne unki baat nitish kumaar se karai
 Manjhi then demanded that Nitish should ask for his resignation through the media and then he would keep the work done during his tenure in the media and the public and media should decide that he should resign
 maanjhi ke is rukh se saafe ho gaya ki filhal vah istipha dene ke liye taiyaar nahin hai or aise main unase istipha lenaa utana aasaan nahin
 Meanwhile, Union Minister and Lok Janshakti Party President Rambilas Paswan said that under the pressure of Nitish, there is an attempt to resign from Manjhi and if Manjhi is removed, the person and the party will be politically wiped out
 vahiin, isse pehle, mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne apane istife kii khabar par viraam lagaate hue kaha ki kahin koi istife kii baat nahin he
 Sharad Yadav has not asked for my resignation

 Resignation is only in the media

 He said that ever since i took the chair, till date the Chief Minister's door has always been open to the workers and ministers as well as the mlas
 pehle mukhyamantri se milanaa mushkil kaary tha, ab yah aasaan ho gaya he
 Jeetan Ram Manjhi once again threatened the officials and said that if the work was done to drive the workers and the poor out of the block and the police station, then that officer would be banished
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki jis tarah se loksabhaa chunaav main janata ko dhokhaa dekar vot lene kaa kaam centre sarkaar ne kiya he, janata aane vaale vidhansabha ke chunaav main use sabak sikhaane kaa kaam karegi
 Manjhi said in a withering voice that when i am doing something for the poor, there is a lot of pressure being put on me
 magar, main garibon ke liye aage bhi kaary karata rahoonga
 He also announced the laying of a life-size statue of Sukhdev Prasad Varma, announcing his death anniversary with state honors
 purv mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke kaary kii jamkar saraahna karte hue jithan ram maanjhi ne kaha ki nitish kumaar ne jo vikaas kaa rodmap taiyaar kiya, use main aage badhaane kaa kaam kar rahaa hum

 He is deaf, but his estimates are very accurate
 ’kondratieva ne kaha ki pichley saal echiles ne apane grih nagar main khele gaye confederation cap maichon ke parinaamon kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi
 The amazing thing is that not a single estimate of him was wrong
 loksabhaa main kashmir par bahes kaa jawaab dete hue grih mantri amit shah ne kaha ki desh kaa baccha baccha yah bolta he ki kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang hai
 Why did he say that Kashmir is an integral part of India? Do we ever ask that Uttar Pradesh is an integral part of India? He said that Article 370 will end today with the blessings of the House and this day will be written in history with golden letters
 grih mantri amit shah ne kaha ki jaise hi sthiti saamaanya ho jaaegi jammu-kashmir ko purna rajya kaa darja de diya jayega
 Amit Shah said that Article 370 does not connect Kashmir and India with each other
 grih mantri ne kaha ki dhara 370 ne is desh or duniya ke man main ek shankaa paidaa kar di thi ki kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he yaa nahin? amit shah ne kaha virdohi party ke kuch log bhi chaahate hai ki kashmir se dhara 370 hate
 The Home Minister said that who had announced to take the Kashmir issue to UN from All India Radio without taking the confidence of the cabinet, was made by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
 unhone kaha ki virdohi bhi chaahate hai ki anuchhed 370 hat jaae
 Shah said that the people of the country understand the difference between 371 and 370 and you will not be misled by it
 amit shah ne kaha ki 370 par bolne ke liye saahas kisi main nahin tha
 It is being said that the path on 370 is not right
 lekin main bataa duun ki rasta to thik he lekin aapke votbank kii raajnneeti ke liye thik nahin he
 It is being said today that the internet is not running there but it was in a bad condition earlier
 hamane vahaan suraksha vyavastha ke liye sab kuch kiya he or hamane kuch nahin hone denge aapako dabaav main aakar ham suraksha balon ko nahin hataayenge
 It is being alleged that it was not discussed
 lekin charchaa karte-karte to 70 saal biit gaye hai lekin charchaa kaa ant nahin hua
 Whom should we discuss who gets donations from Pakistan? ham hurriyat se koi baat nahin karenge
 But the people of the valley belong to us
 ham unako gale se lagaayenge
 But when time changes, the way of discussion also has to change
 bekaari or berogari har rajya kii samasya he
 But there is no 370 there
 isaki vajah se kashmir main algaavvaad badha he
 i want to say again that if the situation is normal in Jammu and Kashmir then we will give it full state status and it will not take us 70 years and tell you that the situation has not deteriorated there yet
 karfu lagaaya gaya he ki sthiti na bigade
 Shah said that it is being said that this is a communal agenda
 kya jammu main hindu, jain buddha nahin rahete hai
 Article 370 was causing injustice to the country's minorities
 1989 se lekar aaj tak 41900 log maare gaye hai or aaj bhi isi raste main chalem jis par ham 70 saalon chal rahe hai
 Sometimes you will have to think differently
 main ladakh ke yuva saansad ko badhai detaa hum jisane apni baat rakhi he
 Owaisi said that the House is going to make a historic mistake, Owaisi, the House is going to rectify the historic mistake
 grahamantri ne kaha, meri party kii parampara he ki desh kaa bhala kismen hai vah dekhakar faislalia jaataa he
 Amit Shah said that today no one has told how Article 370 can do welfare of Kashmir
 lekin main bataaunga ki yah kaise kashmir ko nuksaan karti he
 This stream is anti-development, women and poor and promotes terrorism
 amit shah ne kaha, ' main louh purush nahin bananaa chahta hum
 i am an ordinary party worker
 dhara 370 kii vajah se bal vivaahakanoon lagu nahin kar sakate
 Why the National Minorities Commission was not formed where the Jains reside as Buddhist minorities
 uske baad shiksha kaa adhikaar desh kii sansad ne diya he
 But the children of Jammu and Kashmir do not have this right because 370 was implemented
 bhoomi adhigrahan bill lagu nahin kiya ja sakaa
 Delimitation could not happen in Jammu and Kashmir
 lekin ab aisa nahin chalegaa
 Amit Shah said that the Congress party further talks about the RTI Act but it has not been implemented there
 kyon ki kuch pariwaron kaa bhrashtachar punap rahaa he
 Let me tell you that there is no worry about 370, there is concern that some files have been opened there
 chintaa isaki baat kii he
 He is sweating in the cold
 370 kaa istemaal karke loktantr kaa galaa ghotaa gaya he
 Today, i thank PM Modi's rule, today, 40 thousand sarpanches within Jammu and Kashmir are drawing their own development blueprint
 aapako bataa den ki jammu kashmir (jammu Kashmir) ko do centre shasit pradeshon main baantne vaala bill rajyasabha (rajya Sabha) main paas ho gaya
 Now Jammu Kashmir and Ladakh will be made a union territory
 jammu kashmir (jammu Kashmir) punargathan bill ke paksh main 125 or virodh main 61 vot pade
 The bill will be introduced in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday
 isse saath-saath centre sarkaar ne jammu-kashmir se dhara 370 (article 370) ko hataane kaa elaan bhi kar diya
 With this, the status of the special state which Jammu and Kashmir got, has also ended

 aaj ke jamaane ke kuch ladkaa or ladki aise laila-majanu hote hai jo ek-duusare se mohabbat ke liye apane hi puure parivaar kaa dam bhi nikaal dete hai
 In Ishq a blind couple killed five people from their own homes with their own hands
 wo to naseeb acha tha jo parivaar ke baaki teen log batch gaye
 Otherwise the slaughter was to be eight
 aashiq ke saath milakar kiya 5 logon kaa katlgrator noida se lekar badaayun or badaayun se lekar bulandshahr tak aashiqui kii aanch main jhulase rishton kii ye ek aisi kahani he jiskaa har harf khooni he
 On one side was that sweetheart, who hatched a terrible conspiracy to lay his corpses one after the other to gain his love, and on the other side the blind man who was blind in love, was only reducing the number of the clan of the same love for his love
 
 ishk ke chalate parivaar ne lagaai pabandigrator noida ke gaanv navada main raaje apane parivaar ke saath rahete the
 There was a daughter named Preeti in this family
 jo apane hi gaanv main rahane vaale mugish naam ke ek shaadishuda shaks se pyaar karti thi
 He belonged to another religion
 pehle to donon kaa rishta chori-chhipe chalata rahaa lekin jald hi is pyaar or rishte kii baat priti ke gharavaalon ko pataa chal gai
 After this, the family members of Preeti started banning him and also stopped his exit
 parijanon ko detii thi neend kii dawapriti khud par bhoot-pret kaa saaya hone kaa naatak karne lagi
 Here he started the drama and the householder went to the tantric to solve the problem of the daughter
 iske baad unhen apane hi gaanv ke ek tantric saleem nebadayunmen ek pir baba ke majaar main jaakar jiyaarat karne kii salaah di
 The families accepted that advice and went to Pir Baba's tomb in Badaun many times
 lekin har baar priti majaar main pahunch kar apane gharavaalon ko neend kii dawa de detii or phir vahiin chupake se uskaa apane aashiq mugish ke saath milanaa-julna bhi ho jaataa tha
 The conspiracy was hatched with the murder of eight people, together with his lover, fraudulently fed all his family members by mixing sleeping pills in cold drinks
 jald hi nashili dawa kaa asar hua or dekhte hi dekhte priti ke pita raaje, maa satyavati, mamaa rajendra, maami priti, bhai lalit, bhabhi sheethal, tantric saleem or driver ompal par nasha chaane laga
 Everyone began to faint one by one
 ittefaq se apni tabiyat kharaab hone kii vajah se priti ke bhai, bhabhi or mamaa to dargah main hi ruk gaye
 Preeti said to take the remaining five people to the hospital and loaded them into her car
 tab tak priti kaa aashiq mugish bhi vahaan aa pahunchaa tha
 Now five people including Preeti's parents and maternal aunt had come into her possession
 paanch logon ko di jalsamadhiiske baad to phir aadhi raat ke sannaate main donon gaadi main paanch logon ko lekar bulandshahr ke gang nahar tak pahunche or phir vahaan gaadi ko nahar ke kinare laga kar use peeche se dhakel kar donon ko paanch logon ko jite ji jalsamadhi de di or bhaag nikle
 At that time, both of them thought that perhaps this rule will remain a secret forever, but soon the matter came to light
 agle hi din nahar main samaai maaruti iko car se priti ke maa-baap or maami kii laash baraamad ho gai
 While Tantrik Salim's body was found later and the driver Ompal is still not known
 ye maamla pehle hi din se rahasyamayi tha
 The Bulandshahr police registered a case of murder and started investigating and the suspicion of the police came out right
 kol detail se hua khulasapulice ko pataa chalaa ki us raat priti bhi apane gharavaalon ke saath thi or uskaa bhi koi ata-pataa nahin tha
 After this, when the police got out his call details while investigating, his ears cropped up
 priti apane mobile se lagaataar ek shaks se baat kar rahi thi or ye shaks koi or nahin balki uskaa aashiq mugish tha
 Incidentally, three family members were killed, but Preity's phone sitting in the same car was still on
 phir jald hi police ne jaal bichaaya or jaise hi priti apane aashiq ke saath elahabaad se bulandshahr pahunchi to police ne unhen dhar dabocha
 Both went to Allahabad with the intention of performing a court marriage after the family was eliminated

 Imtiaz has given a new identity to his career by giving a chance to play a serious character to Alamra
 isse pehle ve aaj ke do superstaron deepika padukon or ranbir kapur ko bhi diarect kar chuke hai
 Imtiaz's complexion is clearly visible in his acting in the 2013 successful film Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani
 ubharate sitaron se lekar anuraag kashyap, tigmanshu dhulia, shriram raghavan jaise film nirmaataaon tak unka prabhaav najar aata he
 He started his career shooting these TV serials with these people
 purv patni filmmekar priti ali-jo unke tivi dharawahikon kii bhi nirmaataa raheen hai-se lekar dilli ke hindu college ke apane doston tak, imtiyaaj ne safar main jude logon ko kabhi bhulaayaa nahin or unki bhoomikaaon ko parade par ukera he

 Xavier's Institute, in these days of struggle he had no place to live
 unka maananaa he, ‘‘bhaavnaatmak or aadhyatmik taur par yah unka sabase acha daur he
 i like the way they are moving

 "be it filmmaking, friendship or storytelling, Imtiaz is convinced to break stereotypical traditions
 sadak hi sab kuch he
 He says, "unknowingly you play the role you've been given

 The Hindi Dramatic Society of Hindu College, Ibtida is famous for its street plays
 imtiyaaj ne iskaa gathan hindu college main padhai ke dauraan kiya tha
 This philosophy is seen in Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, in which Deepika and Ranbir set out on a journey together keeping their past separate
 deepika kahati hai ki imtiyaaj ne hi lav aaj kal ke dauraan unke andar chhipe chanchal bachche ko dhund nikaala tha or phir apni likhi cocktail (2012) main us bachche ko ji bharkar udham machaane ke liye khulaa chhod diya
 Imtiaz shares creativity with Ranbir
 aalia kaa kahana he ki ve jin bhi kalakaaron ke saath kaam kar chuke hai, unke saath bhaavnaatmak eemaandaaree se pesh aate hai

 He says, "my biggest fear is to stay or stay stuck in one place
" ’’apni filmon ko ‘‘safar ke dauraan pyaar’’ kii kahani kahe jane par unhen dukh hota he kyonki saaf he ki sameekshak baarikiyon ko pard nahin payah unki filmon main stri or purush ke liye har safar alag he

 safar unke liye is baat ko or majubat karata he
 At the same time, the hero gets direction from the journey

 Born in Jamshedpur, Imtiaz got fond of visiting his father, with whom he often used to go to Patna and other small towns
 jab ve bhai aarif ke saath waapas jamshedpur main apni chachee ke paas rahane lage to yah sab chhot gaya
 Most of the memories of his journey began with his childhood friend, his ex-wife Preeti
 andheri ke unke ghar, jahaan kabhi ve donon saath rahete the, uske kone se priti bada-sa trunk baahar khinchati hai or usamen se kavitaaon kii copy dhundhakar nikaalati hai jinamein imtiyaaj ke safar kii kahani or myne darj hai
 The trunk is full of letters, poems and stories, which he wrote in the days of love

 To spend two days with Preeti, he would reach there after a long and tiring journey of the train
 priti kahati hai, ‘‘imtiyaaj kaa safar aap par jaadu kar detaa he
 Happened to me too lekin auraten is baat ko lekar zyada vyaavhaarik hoti hai ki safar kis disha main ja rahaa he
 Still i love every aspect of it

 a special leave petition filed in the Supreme Court claimed that a Buddhist vihara was present in place of the Babri Masjid and hence the controversial site of Ayodhya should be given to the religious people of this religion

 Giving this information at a press conference, Raj said, 'buddhists living in India challenge the validity and constitutionality of the decision
 na keval vivaadit sthal balki babari masjid ke nirmaan se pehle yah puraa sthal ek buddha vihaar tha
 'former Union Minister and Bharatiya Janshakti Party leader Sanghpriya Gautam, who accompanied Raj on the occasion, urged him to support the argument, citing the Allahabad High Court verdict
 gautam ne kaha, ‘nyaayamurti sudhir agarwal ne kaha ki vivaadit sthal ke kasuti stambh varanasi main maujuud buddha stambhon ke samaan hai
 Justice SU Khan said that (british archaeologist) Karneji had said that the criterion pillars used in the construction of the mosque are similar to the Buddhist pillars that they have seen in Varanasi
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘isliye yah sambhav he ki us sthal par yaa uske aas paas kisi buddha dharmik sthal ke avshesh rahe hon jahaan masjid kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha or isaki kuch saamagree kaa istemaal masjid ke nirmaan main kiya gaya ho
 Raj said that in his report, the Archaeological Survey of India had said in 2003 that the survey found a circular shrine under the disputed site, after which the Allahabad High Court asked him to gather more evidence
 raaj ne kaha, ‘ab tak aisa nahin kiya gaya he
 It is most likely that it is a Buddhist monastery
 masjid kaa nirmaan buddha vihaar ke avasheshon par kiya gaya he or isliye ise baudhon ko diya janaa chahie
 He said that the Archaeological Survey of India has said that the pillar bases along with the massive structure indicate the remains that are the hallmark of temples in North India

 ’’ Rupaiya from my dear weak and weak aae din samachar madhyamon main tumhaare girte-padate rahane kii khabaren dekhtaa rahata hum
 To tell the truth, i do not feel anything after reading the news of your fall
 jaise ki bahut dukhi ho gaya hum yaa bahut khush hum ki koi to gira
 i do not know if you are injured due to falling or you keep falling on paper
 kagaz par koi kaise gir saktaa he rupaya
 So do you fall out of sight, is it like me that you keep on trembling with the earthquake
 itnaa bhi kya kamasin hona
 Do not run from the ladder and lift
 sef jagah par khadey rahanaa dost
 Well, if you have a place to fall, then tell me
 main khud aa jaaoongaa yaa kisi ko bhej duungaa
 Look, don't fall in the money mujhe to tumhaare girane kaa hisaab samaj nahin aata
 At the age of 64, someone works tirelessly as a Prime Minister, the country keeps on running in the world and you are the one who reaches 64 and is considered fallen
 kamazor maan liye jate ho
 Who are these people who are telling you to decline? tumhaare hone se hamaara jivan kitna pragatisheel ho jaataa he
 The life of the country becomes developing and you are being told that the fallen
 kamazor kahe ja rahe ho
 Say that we have not weakened
 ham purse main rakhe rakhe gal zarur gaye hai magar ham main dam or daam ab bhi baaki he re puspa
 Say the dialogue with Rajesh Khanna
 rupalli, kya main pyaar se tumhen rupee kii jagah rupalli kah saktaa hum
 How many people call you Rupalli at chowk-chaubare
 ‘adrabhaij’ mat lenaa
 We did not know when you used to fall and when you used to jump
 nayaa nayaa patrkaar bana to hamaare ek sampadak din bhar bataate rahete ki dekho bhai log, i jo rupaya he dolarava ke mukaable hi chadhataa rahata he
 We were happy only
 hamaara rupaya dollars ko patake bhi detaa he
 The eye also shows
 dollars maane america bhaijan ko aankh maar detaa he
 We said that well done Rupalli
 ham to nahin kar sake tu hi kamaal karte rahio
 But more than this, you did not stop being weak
 do saal pehle jab chunaav kaa maahaul garmaya na to ham dekhe ki rojje log twit kar rahe hai ki aaj bhi rupaya kamazor ho gaya
 Where has the country reached? ham rasaatal main hai ki rupaya 64 par he
 Whoever saw you at 64, felt sitting on the sofa that he had moved from the drawing room to the basement
 ek netaa ne kaha ki kabhi ham dollar ke baraabar the
 One dollar equals one rupee
 ham rupee ko dollar ke baraabar le aayenge
 Then we quickly hit Google what were our beautiful dreams in the days of dollar parity
 jawaab nahin mila
 i do not know when and how in the name of the dollar, you have started shouting here and there
 sunate sunate laga ki agar mulk ko rasaatal main jane se bachaana he ki tumko rupalli kuch karnaa hoga
 Put down the prestige of the country in the morning and evening, eat and drink, stay in my street
 ye main gaanaa likh rahaa hum tumko prerit karne ke liye rupaya
 It seems that you too feel like reaching youth at 64
 isiilie baar-baar vahiin pahunch jate ho kaa
 If we were scholars in mathematics, we would think that by coming to 61, you become strong and when you go to 64, you are weak
 sabzi mandi main koi aalu taul rahaa ho jaise
 Take out a potato, put the pan there and keep one here
 tum thik-thik bataao ki tumko kamazori kab bujhaata he
 At 61 or at 64
 dekho, rupaya, ham tumko pyaar karte hai
 Father is not very brother
 da hole thing inz dait ki sabase bada rupaya
 You have been called the greatest and you are the one who falls
 pite-pate to nahin ho na
 tell
 sarkaar ne nashamukthi par program chalaaya hua he
 If we did not love money, we would not spend day and night like this
 tumhaari khaatir ham kis kis kii khatiradaari main lage hai, tumko maaloom bhi na hoga
 You are not looking at things, you are rolling
 acha hua ki ab log tumhaare girane par hangaamaa nahin karte
 Who does not care about who falls in the circle of who, when and where he falls
 isliye he rupaya tum ho gaye ho senior citijan
 You will also get lower birth in the train
 haada bhi kam lagegaa
 In 63-64 years, people go out on pilgrimage in our village
 tum ho ki 64 ke duaariye par dhimla jate ho ( darvaaze par hi ludhak jate ho)
 Give you vitamins
 bornvita yaa horlix
 Do not worry
 dollars se muqabla chhod do
 Say our words
 kah do duniya se ki ham ‘miself’ main yakeen karte hai
 i am who i am
 wo kamazor hum yaa majboot hum mujhe nahin pataa, main 64 hum to hum
 So don't worry about money
 kaho ki ham apane gir gaye hai
 We are not playing matches with the dollar
 64 ke hone par bharat ko kuch nahin hota he
 e there is no Richter scale that a blow came and all out of the building
 tum giro yaa mat giro hamako kaa he
 Wherever you fall, we reach there without falling
 tum jahaan jaakar chadhe hue kehalaate ho ham to vahaan chadhakar bhi gire hue kehalaate hai
 Have you heard that you go abroad too for a walk and do not come back
 vitt mantri ne kanoon banaaya he ki ab se koi bhi rupaya blike hokar baahar jayega use safed karne ke liye bataanaa padegaa
 It is also heard that you go and hide in a foreign bank
 lukaye lukaye kaala pad jate ho or ihaan jethmalani ji tumko nikaal kar laane ke liye rose court main bahes kar rahe hon
 That's why you go abroad
 kiskaa man nahin karata he videsh main ghoomane ke liye lekin waapas aa jaao
 Like Shahrukh Khan's film Swadesh
 mek in india kaa rupaya videshon main rahe acchhee baat nahin he rupalli
 There are no banks here for you to hide
 kaala hi hona he to videsh main jaakar kyon hote ho
 This is it
 koi roktaa he kaa ji tumko
 The comments tum majboot bano
 Be brave
 ek din dollars tumhaare mukaable giregaa
 You will never fall wo din aa rahaa he
 Before you come, fulfill all your wishes to fall
 kamazor hona koi gunaah nahin hota he
 Rupalli live your life
 lod mat le
 How nice you look in the purse
 tum jab mere paas hote ho to doosraa koi nahin hota
 It is a song but this song has been dedicated to you
 rupalli gaanaa sun
 Have fun
 free mind se life ji
 Being weak and strong does nothing
 isliye he rupaya tum apane maarg par chalo
 Drink pomegranate juice
 magar kamazor mat bano
 Stay 64 or go beyond 64 but stay Indian
 tumhaari kamazori kisi kii siinaajori nahin he
 Your big brother raveesh kumaar i keep watching the news of your falling in the media every day
 sach kahuun to main tumhaare girane kii khabaron ko padhakar kuch mahasoos nahin karata
 Like i am very sad or very happy that someone has fallen
 mujhe pataa nahin ki girane se tum ghayal hote ho yaa kaagaz par hi girte rahete ho
 How can a rupee fall on paper? to kya tum nazaron se gir jate ho, kahin aisa to nahin meri tarah bukamp se tum bhi ghabaraate hue dolate rahete ho
 Even so, to be a commuter
 seedhi or lift se mat bhaagna
 Friend, standing in a safe place
 khayr, tumhaare girane kii koi jagah he to bataa dena
 i will come myself or send someone
 dekho, rupaya tum giro mat
 i do not understand the account of your fall
 64 saal kii umr main koi pradhanmantri banakar athak parishram karata rahata he, desh duniya main bhaagate rahata he or tum ho ki 64 par pahunch kar gire hue maan liye jate ho
 You are considered weak
 ye koun log hai, jo tumhen patansheel bataa rahe hai
 How progressive our life becomes with you
 desh kaa jivan vikasshil ho jaataa he or tum ho ki gire hue bataaye ja rahe ho
 You are being called weak bolo ki ham kamazor nahin hue hai
 We have gone to the gully kept in the purse, but we have the strength and the price is still left, Pushpa
 bol de rajesh khanna vaala dialog
 Rupalli, can i lovingly call you Rupalli instead of Rs
 chowk-chaubaare par tumhen kitne log rupalli bhi pukaarte hai
 Do not take 'assemble'
 tum kab girte the or kab uchhalte the hamen pataa hi nahin chalata tha
 If a new journalist is created, one of our editors keeps telling us throughout the day that, brothers, the rupee which is the rupee keeps climbing against the dollar
 ham to khush hi ho gaye
 Our rupee also hits the dollar
 aankh bhi dikhaa detaa he
 Dollar believes America kills Bhaijaan
 ham to bole the ki shaabaash rupalli
 We could not do anything but you continue to do wonders
 magar isse zyada tumhaara kamazor hona bujhaata nahin tha
 Two years ago, when the election atmosphere was heated up, neither did we see that Rojje people are tweeting that the rupee has weakened even today
 hai re desh kahaan pahunch gaya
 We are in the abyss that the rupee is at 64
 jo bhi tumko 64 par dekhtaa tha na, sopha par baithe baithe feel karne lagata tha ki drawing room se sarak kar basament main aa gaya he
 One leader said that once we were equal to the dollar
 ek dollars baraabar ek rupaya
 We will bring the rupee equal to the dollar
 tab ham jhat se google maare ki tab dollars kii barabari ke dinon main hamaare haseen sapane kya the
 Did not get an answer
 pataa nahin kab or kaise tum dollars ke naam par kabhi idhar to kabhi udhar dolane lage
 Hearing that, if you want to save the country from going to the abyss, you have to do something rupalli
 desh kii pratishtha ko tum yun na subah shaam giraaya karo, kha pikar date raho, meri gali aayaa karo
 i am writing this song to inspire you
 lagata he ki tum bhi 64 par pahunch javaani jaisaa feel karte ho
 That is why you reach there again and again
 ham ganit main vidwaan rahete to samajhate ki 61 par aate ho to majboot ho jate ho or 64 par jate ho to kamazor
 Like weighing some potatoes in vegetable market
 ek aalu nikaala to palada udhar or ek rakh diya to idhar
 Tell me exactly when your weakness is extinguished
 61 par yaa 64 par
 Look, Rupee, we love you
 baap bada na bhaiya
 The biggest thing that is the biggest rupee
 tumko sabase bada kaha gaya or tum ho ki ludhak jate ho
 You can't be drinking or not
 bataa do
 The government has a program on de-addiction
 rupee se pyaar na karte to ham din raat aise na khatate
 For whose sake we are engaged in the responsibility of whom, you will not even know
 tum ho ki aav dekhe na taav ludhak jate ho
 It is good that now people do not make a ruckus when you fall
 jiskaa thikaana nahin ki kab koun kahaan gir pade uske chakkar main koun pade
 That's why you have become a senior citizen
 train main loar berth bhi milegaa tumko
 The freight will also be less
 63-64 saal main hamaare gaanv main log tirthayatra par nikal jate hai
 You are that you drown at the point of 64 (you roll at the door)
 vitamin den tumko
 Bournvita or Horlicks
 chintaa mat karo
 Quit competing against the dollar
 maan lo hamari baat
 Tell the world that we believe in 'myself'
 main jo hum wo hum
 I'm weak or strong i don't know, I'm 64
 isliye rupaya tum phikar mat karo
 Say that we have fallen
 ham dollars ke saath match khel hi nahin rahe he
 Nothing happens to India when it is 64
 i koi richter scale nahin he ki ek jhatka aayaa or sab building se baahar
 You fall or do not fall belongs to us
 tum jahaan jaakar girte ho ham to vahaan pahunche bina hi gire hue hai
 Wherever you go, you are called climbing and we are said to have fallen there
 sune hai ki tum videsh bhi chale jate ho ghoomane ke liye or jate ho to laut kar nahin aate
 The Finance Minister has made a law that from now on any rupee will go black and will have to be told to turn white
 ye bhi sune hai ki tum videshi bank main luka (chhip) jate ho
 Lukaye Lukaye turns black and here Jethmalani ji is arguing daily in court to get you out
 isliye he rupaya tum videsh jaao
 Who does not feel to roam abroad but come back
 shahrukh khan kii film swadesh kii tarah
 The rupee of Make in India abroad is not a good thing Rupalli
 yahaan bank nahin hai tumhaare chhipane ke liye
 If you want to go black then why do you go abroad
 yahi ho jaao
 Someone stops you
 tippaniyan You be strong vir bano
 One day the dollar will fall against you
 tum kabhi nahin giroge
 That day is coming aane se pehle tum girane kii apni sabhi khwahishen puri kar lo
 Being weak is not a crime
 rupalli tu apni life ji le
 Do not load
 tum purse main tatka-tatka( tazaa) kitna acha lagate ho
 When you are with me, no one else is there
 ye gaanaa he lekin ye gaanaa tumko dedicket kar diye hai
 Listen to the song Rupalli
 mouj kar
 Live the life from free mind
 kamazor or majboot rahane se kuch nahin hota he
 That's why you go on your path
 anaar kaa zeus piyo
 But don't be weak
 64 raho yaa 64 ke paar jaao magar indian bane raho
 Your weakness is not the weakness of anyone
 tumhaara bada bhaiyya ravish Kumar dekho, rupaya tum giro mat
 i do not understand the account of your fall
 64 saal kii umr main koi pradhanmantri banakar athak parishram karata rahata he, desh duniya main bhaagate rahata he or tum ho ki 64 par pahunch kar gire hue maan liye jate ho
 You are considered weak
 ye koun log hai, jo tumhen patansheel bataa rahe hai
 How progressive our life becomes with you
 desh kaa jivan vikasshil ho jaataa he or tum ho ki gire hue bataaye ja rahe ho
 You are being called weak bolo ki ham kamazor nahin hue hai
 We have gone to the gully kept in the purse, but we have the strength and the price is still left, Pushpa
 bol de rajesh khanna vaala dialog
 Rupalli, can i lovingly call you Rupalli instead of Rs
 chowk-chaubaare par tumhen kitne log rupalli bhi pukaarte hai
 Do not take 'assemble'
 tum kab girte the or kab uchhalte the hamen pataa hi nahin chalata tha
 If a new journalist is created, one of our editors keeps telling us throughout the day that, brothers, the rupee which is the rupee keeps climbing against the dollar
 ham to khush hi ho gaye
 Our rupee also hits the dollar
 aankh bhi dikhaa detaa he
 Dollar believes America kills Bhaijaan
 ham to bole the ki shaabaash rupalli
 We could not do anything but you continue to do wonders
 magar isse zyada tumhaara kamazor hona bujhaata nahin tha
 Two years ago, when the election atmosphere was heated up, neither did we see that Rojje people are tweeting that the rupee has weakened even today
 hai re desh kahaan pahunch gaya
 We are in the abyss that the rupee is at 64
 jo bhi tumko 64 par dekhtaa tha na, sopha par baithe baithe feel karne lagata tha ki drawing room se sarak kar basament main aa gaya he
 One leader said that once we were equal to the dollar
 ek dollars baraabar ek rupaya
 We will bring the rupee equal to the dollar
 tab ham jhat se google maare ki tab dollars kii barabari ke dinon main hamaare haseen sapane kya the
 Did not get an answer
 pataa nahin kab or kaise tum dollars ke naam par kabhi idhar to kabhi udhar dolane lage
 Hearing that, if you want to save the country from going to the abyss, you have to do something rupalli
 desh kii pratishtha ko tum yun na subah shaam giraaya karo, kha pikar date raho, meri gali aayaa karo
 i am writing this song to inspire you
 lagata he ki tum bhi 64 par pahunch javaani jaisaa feel karte ho
 That is why you reach there again and again
 ham ganit main vidwaan rahete to samajhate ki 61 par aate ho to majboot ho jate ho or 64 par jate ho to kamazor
 Like weighing some potatoes in vegetable market
 ek aalu nikaala to palada udhar or ek rakh diya to idhar
 Tell me exactly when your weakness is extinguished
 61 par yaa 64 par
 Look, Rupee, we love you
 baap bada na bhaiya
 The biggest thing that is the biggest rupee
 tumko sabase bada kaha gaya or tum ho ki ludhak jate ho
 You can't be drinking or not
 bataa do
 The government has a program on de-addiction
 rupee se pyaar na karte to ham din raat aise na khatate
 For whose sake we are engaged in the responsibility of whom, you will not even know
 tum ho ki aav dekhe na taav ludhak jate ho
 It is good that now people do not make a ruckus when you fall
 jiskaa thikaana nahin ki kab koun kahaan gir pade uske chakkar main koun pade
 That's why you have become a senior citizen
 train main loar berth bhi milegaa tumko
 The freight will also be less
 63-64 saal main hamaare gaanv main log tirthayatra par nikal jate hai
 You are that you drown at the point of 64 (you roll at the door)
 vitamin den tumko
 Bournvita or Horlicks
 chintaa mat karo
 Quit competing against the dollar
 maan lo hamari baat
 Tell the world that we believe in 'myself'
 main jo hum wo hum
 I'm weak or strong i don't know, I'm 64
 isliye rupaya tum phikar mat karo
 Say that we have fallen

 But don't be weak
 64 raho yaa 64 ke paar jaao magar indian bane raho
 Your weakness is not the weakness of anyone
 tumhaara bada bhaiyya ravish Kumar rupalli, kya main pyaar se tumhen rupee kii jagah rupalli kah saktaa hum
 How many people call you Rupalli at chowk-chaubare
 ‘adrabhaij’ mat lenaa
 We did not know when you used to fall and when you used to jump
 nayaa nayaa patrkaar bana to hamaare ek sampadak din bhar bataate rahete ki dekho bhai log, i jo rupaya he dolarava ke mukaable hi chadhataa rahata he
 We were happy only
 hamaara rupaya dollars ko patake bhi detaa he
 The eye also shows
 dollars maane america bhaijan ko aankh maar detaa he
 We said that well done Rupalli
 ham to nahin kar sake tu hi kamaal karte rahio
 But more than this, you did not stop being weak
 do saal pehle jab chunaav kaa maahaul garmaya na to ham dekhe ki rojje log twit kar rahe hai ki aaj bhi rupaya kamazor ho gaya
 Where has the country reached? ham rasaatal main hai ki rupaya 64 par he
 Whoever saw you at 64, felt sitting on the sofa that he had moved from the drawing room to the basement
 ek netaa ne kaha ki kabhi ham dollar ke baraabar the
 One dollar equals one rupee
 ham rupee ko dollar ke baraabar le aayenge
 Then we quickly hit Google what were our beautiful dreams in the days of dollar parity
 jawaab nahin mila
 i do not know when and how in the name of the dollar, you have started shouting here and there
 sunate sunate laga ki agar mulk ko rasaatal main jane se bachaana he ki tumko rupalli kuch karnaa hoga
 Put down the prestige of the country in the morning and evening, eat and drink, stay in my street
 ye main gaanaa likh rahaa hum tumko prerit karne ke liye rupaya
 It seems that you too feel like reaching youth at 64
 isiilie baar-baar vahiin pahunch jate ho kaa
 If we were scholars in mathematics, we would think that by coming to 61, you become strong and when you go to 64, you are weak
 sabzi mandi main koi aalu taul rahaa ho jaise
 Take out a potato, put the pan there and keep one here
 tum thik-thik bataao ki tumko kamazori kab bujhaata he
 At 61 or at 64
 dekho, rupaya, ham tumko pyaar karte hai
 Father is not very brother
 da hole thing inz dait ki sabase bada rupaya
 You have been called the greatest and you are the one who falls
 pite-pate to nahin ho na
 tell
 sarkaar ne nashamukthi par program chalaaya hua he
 If we did not love money, we would not spend day and night like this
 tumhaari khaatir ham kis kis kii khatiradaari main lage hai, tumko maaloom bhi na hoga
 You are not looking at things, you are rolling
 acha hua ki ab log tumhaare girane par hangaamaa nahin karte
 Who does not care about who falls in the circle of who, when and where he falls
 isliye he rupaya tum ho gaye ho senior citijan
 You will also get lower birth in the train
 haada bhi kam lagegaa
 In 63-64 years, people go out on pilgrimage in our village
 tum ho ki 64 ke duaariye par dhimla jate ho ( darvaaze par hi ludhak jate ho)
 Give you vitamins
 bornvita yaa horlix
 Do not worry
 dollars se muqabla chhod do
 Say our words
 kah do duniya se ki ham ‘miself’ main yakeen karte hai
 i am who i am
 wo kamazor hum yaa majboot hum mujhe nahin pataa, main 64 hum to hum
 So don't worry about money
 kaho ki ham apane gir gaye hai
 We are not playing matches with the dollar
 64 ke hone par bharat ko kuch nahin hota he
 e there is no Richter scale that a blow came and all out of the building
 tum giro yaa mat giro hamako kaa he
 Wherever you fall, we reach there without falling
 tum jahaan jaakar chadhe hue kehalaate ho ham to vahaan chadhakar bhi gire hue kehalaate hai
 Have you heard that you go abroad too for a walk and do not come back
 vitt mantri ne kanoon banaaya he ki ab se koi bhi rupaya blike hokar baahar jayega use safed karne ke liye bataanaa padegaa
 It is also heard that you go and hide in a foreign bank
 lukaye lukaye kaala pad jate ho or ihaan jethmalani ji tumko nikaal kar laane ke liye rose court main bahes kar rahe hon
 That's why you go abroad
 kiskaa man nahin karata he videsh main ghoomane ke liye lekin waapas aa jaao
 Like Shahrukh Khan's film Swadesh
 mek in india kaa rupaya videshon main rahe acchhee baat nahin he rupalli
 There are no banks here for you to hide
 kaala hi hona he to videsh main jaakar kyon hote ho
 This is it
 koi roktaa he kaa ji tumko
 The comments tum majboot bano
 Be brave
 ek din dollars tumhaare mukaable giregaa
 You will never fall wo din aa rahaa he
 Before you come, fulfill all your wishes to fall
 kamazor hona koi gunaah nahin hota he
 Rupalli live your life
 lod mat le
 How nice you look in the purse
 tum jab mere paas hote ho to doosraa koi nahin hota
 It is a song but this song has been dedicated to you
 rupalli gaanaa sun
 Have fun
 free mind se life ji
 Being weak and strong does nothing
 isliye he rupaya tum apane maarg par chalo
 Drink pomegranate juice
 magar kamazor mat bano
 Stay 64 or go beyond 64 but stay Indian
 tumhaari kamazori kisi kii siinaajori nahin he

 The NGT has directed a dozen states to convert these buses into CNG to curb 10-year-old diesel buses coming from outside states in Delhi

 The Delhi government had said in the NGT that the government is spraying water from vehicles to reduce the level of pollution, for the time being the NGT has ordered all the states to convert old buses into CNG to reduce pollution levels in Delhi NCR
 But given how much all state governments follow this directive of NGT, this is a big question

 According to Rijiju, one of the reasons for this is due to the change in Section 166A of the IPC, which made it mandatory to file an FIR on rape

 The country is not known, but there is a stir among the staunch supporters of BJP and Narendra Modi
 modi for piem ke naare kaa jor he
 But now no one becomes the PM of a country just by slogans
 gaya wo jamaana jab soot kii sari or kalai main ledar ghadi pahane indira gandhi manch par chadhati thim, bolne ke pehle pallu thik karti thim or garibi hataao kaa naaraa detii thim, to janata ko maseehaa najar aata tha
 But Modi and his team are trying to prove that they are the next messiah of a changing India and democracy
 ye shor party ke baahar sibar spes main bhi jamkar he
 But beyond the noise there are some questions, ten questions, answers to which Modi supporters will have to find
 inase paar paae bina narendra modi is desh ke piem kabhi bhi nahin ban sakate
 1
 bijepi ko chahie loksabhaa main 272 siten272 wo number he, jise bijepi tab bhi hasil nahin kar pai, jab desh main 'abaki baari atal bihari' kaa shor tha
 1998 and 1999, are two years when the NDA government led by Vajpayee formed a majority at the Center
 1998 main bijepi 388 siton par chunaav ladi or 182 siten jiti
 The following year, the Vajpayee-led BJP, given the sympathy of losing the vote of confidence by a vote of Kargil Vijay and a vote in Lok Sabha, gave more seats to its allies
 bijepi 339 siton par chunaav ladi or phir se 182 siten jeetin
 Now let's talk about the last election ie 2009
 isamen 433 siton par chunaav ladakar bijepi 116 siten hi jeet pai
 Now the question is that Modi not only has to maintain this performance in the next election, but also have to increase it by about one and a half times
 jo naammumkin hi he
 2
 saath hi nahin aana chahta koimodi ke piem banane main doosraa adnga he unki chhavi or raajnneeti
 Vajpayee could become PM only when he found new partners in many states and made the NDA clan bigger, bigger
 magar unke kaarykaal ke aakhri baras main zyaadaatar saajheedaar chhitak gaye
 Since then, this family has decreased
 sirf akali dal, jediu or shivasena bache hai isamen
 The crisis before the NDA is to bring old friends back
 kaha jaataa he ki modi ke jayalalita se achche raajnneetik sambandh hai
 But Amma has not yet clarified her stand
 naveen patnayak bhi philhal ekala chalo ke rukh par kaayam hai
 Nitish's hatred is well known
 mamata ko bengal ke muslim votaron kii chintaa he
 Talking about some new partners, the NCP is facing a lot of corruption charges
 neshnal conference congress kii god se utar nahin sakati kyonki uske soobe kii apni siyasat he
 So when there are no partners, will the comments on Facebook make Modi the PM
 3
 Struggle in saints house, how to play Modi innings is a house with ten heads
 philhal bhale hi modi ke saamne khulkar koi na aa rahaa ho, magar jab tab adwani, shivaraj or sangh parivaar bhi ishaara kar detaa he ki vanamen sho nahin chalegaa
 Leaders like Sushma Swaraj feel that they have been doing central politics for almost two decades, are mass appeal and now when the turn of the top post comes, a state umbrella is claiming
 gaur karne kii baat yah he ki sushamaa ne kabhi bhi modi ko party kaa sabase lokapriy netaa tak nahin kaha
 Arun Jaitley, who once used to be Modi's Chanakya, is trying to put his roots at the root of the same, but with a quiet sense of advocacy
 rajnath modigan kar rahe hai, magar unka vajood aise hi bana or panpa he party main
 And among these heaviest, the elders of the house, Advani, who has been silent for the time, but has not missed it yet
 unako hausala dene ke liye gadakari se lekar sanjay joshi tak ek lambii fouj he asantusht sipahasalaron kii
 So until Modi becomes the undisputed leader like Vajpayee of his party, how will he become the leader of the country
 4
 Modi does not believe that remember Nitish
 is desh main siyasat kerani he, to tikaa or topi se parhez nahin chalegaa
 CM of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan knows this
 id milte hai, hajiyon ko vidaa karne jate hai, nikaah karavaate hai sarkari kharche par
 But Modi does not believe at all
 unhone jab tab saaf kar diya ki vah muslimon ke bich apni chhavi badalane ke bajaay sakht prashaasak kii chhavi ko pukhta karne main zyada yakeen karte hai
 Whatever the reason may be the riots, or the image, the truth is that the Muslim of this country gets shocked as soon as he hears the name of Modi
 zyaadaatar ko lagata he ki agar modi aa gaye, to unke liye puraa desh gujarat ban jayega
 There will always be a shadow of fear and doubtful eyes
 isliye yah tay he ki modi kii daavedaari kaa elaan hote hi puure desh main muslim voter, bas ek hi agenda par kaam kare, modi haraao
 Wherever he is seen defeating BJP, vote him unilaterally
 agar aisa hua, to bijepi sirf haath hi malegi
 5
 uttar pradesh main nahin he party ke paas uttarupi main bijepi kii lutiyaa duubani shuru hui 1998 ke baad
 Kalyan Singh was CM and Rajnath Singh was sowing every possible thorn in his path
 kalyaan itane alag thalag pad gaye ki ek saal baad hi apni party ko siem rahete hue haraane main lag gaye
 As a result, the party's 58 mps came down to 38
 iske baad kalyaan party se nikaal die gaye or ramprakash gupta ke baad rajnath siem bane
 Made a lot of announcements, made claims, but the party's seats in the UP Assembly were reduced to 88
 rajnath centre main mantri banakar aa gaye or 2004 ke chunaav main bijepi kii or bhi kalai put gai
 Now the situation is that the party yearns to reach the figures of roar in UP
 80 siton vaala ye suba kabhi daawa karata tha ki ham desh chalaate hai, isko dam miltaa tha in ankon se
 But the BJP is still in disarray in UP
 yahaan buudhe ho chuke netaaon kii bharmaar he, jo apni seat jeet len, to bahut he
 Everyone keeps on setting each other up
 aise main jab uttar pradesh kii siyasat kaa uttar hi nahin he, to dilli darbar bas khwab hi bana rahegaa
 6
 dakshin main miltaa he party ko bas andabijepi ko dakshin shabd se pyaar he
 In ideological debates, it is also called right wing party
 magar desh ke dakshin main bijepi ke liye kuch bhi rhite nahin he
 Never opened an account in Kerala
 karnataka main hui chhichhaledar puure desh ne dekhi
 In Andhra Pradesh, grassroots leaders like Bandaru Dattatreya were sidelined and Delhi brand leaders like Venkaiah Naidu were extended
 tidipi sa saathi gaya or siten gayi so byaaj main
 Whenever Tamil Nadu flourishes, the partner's shoulder rests
 philhal yahaan bhi party khaali haath he
 No matter how well the BJP performs in the north Indian states due to this blank, neither the Pan India party will be able to form nor will it be able to knock Delhi on its own
 7
 The alliance will not work because of the oneman show, and supporters of the policy will say that the entire analysis is negative and will not last
 chaliye ek haa apanaate hai or maan lete hai ki modi bijepi ko bhi munafa dilaayenge or saajheedaar bhi jutaayenge or satta bhi paa lenge
 Then the question arises that after getting power and even more difficult it is to run with the partners
 vaajapeyi do thokaron ke baad iske sabak siikhe
 After taking oath in 1996, the partners could not be found and had to resign in 13 days
 1998 main bahumat mila or 13 maheene sarkaar chali
 Then Subramanian Swamy had a tea party, Amma met Sonia and Shiraja was shattered
 iske baad jod tod ke mode par party haari or vishwaas mat main ek mat kam rah gaya
 These were the lessons that Vajpayee remembered in 1999 and despite all the difficulties his resilient diplomatic attitude was successful and the partners could not create a crisis of confidence vote
 magar modi vanamen sho vaale hai
 Are strict, not flexible
 apni party ke logon ko saath le nahin chal paae, soobe kii jaruraton ke mutabik raajnneeti badalane vaale saathiyon ko kaise saath rakhenge
 8
 sansadeey raajnneeti kaa bilkul bhi anubhav nahib tak baat ho rahi thi bahari hisson kii
 Now come to this person, whose name is Narendra Modi
 vaajapeyi pachaas ke dashak main pehali baar sansad pahunche the
 From Balrampur, U
P
 kuch brake chhodkar 2004 tak sansad main rahe
 Advani also has decades of parliamentary experience
 yahi baat sushamaa-jetali or duusare kendriya netaaon ke bare main bhi kahi ja sakati he
 But Narendra Modi, he has only seen Parliament from the visitors' gallery
 sansadeey saundh kii pantarebaaji, floor management or bahason kii disha palatnaa raily sambodhit karne sa aasaan nahin he
 Modi does not have any experience of parliamentary politics at all, this goes against him randomly
 kyonki sawaal sirf sansad main baithne kaa nahin, uski pechidagiyon ko samajhane kaa bhi he
 Here they have to rely on colleagues not bureaucracy who have long experience
 unka anubhav modi ke bheetar dar bhi bhar saktaa he
 9
 gujarat ke baahar kahin jeet dilaai kyaanarendra modi gujarat ke sher hai
 Not only his supporters, we also believe this
 aakhir lagaataar teen vidhansabha chunaav jeetna koi majaak nahin
 But what outside this state
 kya modi ke dam par bijepi kisi or rajya main satta hasil kar pai he, kya kar paaegi
 No answer to this question
 jald aa rahe chunaavon kii hi baat karen, to rajasthan main bijepi modi nahin vasundhara ke bharose hai
 The high command has given her a free hand and she would not like to interfere in the state
 shivaraj khud ko modi se kamatar nahin samajhate
 Dr
 raman singh bhi kamobesh tab se hi siem hai, jab se modi
 Delhi is a state where Modi can play his cards freely
 magar yahaan kaam bigaadane ko aap he
 This is a matter of assembly elections
 loksabhaa main to or bhi bada khet he kaatane ko
 Those who project Modi as PM should tell when they prepared a strategy for a Lok Sabha election before that and how successful they were
 10
 The stain of the riots has not been removed till now and now talk on that, on hearing of which the BP of Modi devotees increases
 gujarat dangon kaa daag
 His own PM Vajpayee had said that Rajdharma should be performed
 modi gujarat main dangon se aage bad gaye, magar desh ko yaad he ki ajtak unhone kabhi bhi khulkar nahin kaha ki gujarat main jo hua wo nahin hona chahie tha
 The state government should have crushed the rioters strictly
 iske bajaay gujarat dangon ke dauraan virodh karne waalon ko ek ek karke kinare lagate dekha gaya he
 Nothing will happen by being wide, nor by being silent
 kyonki desh ajtak congress se 1984 ke dangon kaa hisaab maangata he
 Sikhs still flare up today
 bhale hi usee congress ne ek sikh ko pehali baar piem banaaya ho
 Modi does not consider the riots to be a blot, what will he apologize for, and as long as the riots have clung to his shadow, he will be less of a bet in the election riots

 ham bilkul nahin chaahate ki iskaa unke (jaradaari) bharat daure par koi asar ho
 We understand that his visit to India is indeed very constructive, and that is what we all want
 'toner ne kaha ki america donon deshon ke bich baatcheet main koi bhoomika nahin nibhaa rahaa he
 But when there is a dialogue between India and Pakistan and better cooperation develops between the two, it is a beneficial situation for us
 kya maa-baap itane laaparvaah ho sakate hai ki unke bachche kii jaan par ban aae? aisi hi ek ghatana dilli main saamne ai he, jahaan maa-baap kii laaparvaahee ke chalate do saal ke maasoom harsith ne tejaab pi liya
 He was admitted to Gangaram Hospital in critical condition
 doctoron ne uski endoscopy kii or paaya ki tejaab ke kaaran uski food pipe or pet kaa kuch bhaag buree tarah se jal gaya tha
 There were blisters in the food pipe, treatment started and is still going on
 philhal harsith kuch kha nahin saktaa he, use ivifluid baahar se diya ja rahaa he
 On September 8, Harshit drank acid, the day of September eight would hardly forget Harshit's parents
 harsith kii maa ne tejaab ko ek pani kii bottle main bhar kar rakhaa tha, uski maa galati se wo bottle bathroom ke baahar bhul gai or kisi duusare kaam vyast ho gai
 The little cheerful arrived there and drank the acid considering the water
 bas uski haalat khasta ho gai
 The mother was in a bad condition use pehle ek sarkari aspataal main le jaaya gaya lekin vahaan uskaa ilaaj shuru nahin ho sakaa
 He was then brought to Gangaram
 gangaaraam main turant shuru hua ilajagangaraam main doctoron ne maamle kii gambhirtha ko samajhate hue harsith kaa turant ilaaj shuru kiya
 Joyful blisters are drying up at this time
 harsith ko dekh rahe yahaan ke bal rog visheshgy dow nishanth kaa kahana he ki ye samay aane par pataa chalegaa ki kya ham uski food pipe phir se khol pate hai, unhone bataaya ki chhaalon ke kaaran food pipe buree tarah se sikud jaati he
 One way is to open it with endoscopy after the blisters have healed and if this is not possible, an artificial food pipe will have to be made to give Harshit a new life
 doctoron ko bhi intjaar he ki kab harsith ke chhaale sookhen or kab uskaa aage ilaaj ho sake
 At the moment, Harshit's parents have also fully realized their mistake, they are now waiting for Harshit to recover
 isse pehle bhi saamne aa chuke hai aise maamledow
 According to Nishant, this is not the only case, every year they come across 20-30 cases, where the children drink some chemical due to the negligence of the parents
 unke anusaar ghar main chemical yaa tejaab jaise padaarth bacchon kii pahunch se dur hone chahie or unhen kabhi bhi kisi coldrink yaa pani kii bottle main nahin bharna chahie
 They should be kept in the packing they are in
 unka ye bhi kahana he ki kabhi kisi ke ghar aisa haadasa ho jaae to bachche ko kuch khilaanaa-pilaanaa nahin chahie, ulti bilkul nahin karaani chahie, bachche ko sidhaa litaakar turant aspataal laana chahie
 This accident lesson is for all parents whose children are small, immature and try to eat and drink everything

 Some similar things apply to Dinesh Patel, a 23-year-old baseball player from Khanpur, Banaras
 ek saadhaaran se kisaan parivaar main 8 may, 1989 ko janme dinesh patel, jinke pita ghanashyam patel ke paas do biswa jameen bhi nahin he, kaa man bachapan se hi khel kii duniya main naam kamaane kaa tha
 Dinesh's parents were so poor that they did not even have the money to raise them properly
 isliye unhen unki nani ke paas khanpur bhej diya gaya
 The trend towards sports arose in Dinesh's mind from there
 jaisaa ki patel kehete hai, “meraa jhukaav bachapan se hi khelon kii taraf tha
 By becoming a good player, i wanted to illuminate my parents' name in the country
 isliye maine bahut pehle se hi practice shuru kar di thi
 However, at that time i was in a state of confusion as to which sport to try
 ”dinesh kii is uhapoh ko kuch had tak kam karne kaa kaam kiya unheen ke gaanv ke antarrashtriya str par naam kama chuke dhaavak santosh patel ne
 On Santosh's suggestion, Dinesh started preparing for javelin throw and baseball
 dinesh ko ek rasta to mil gaya tha, lekin manzil ab bhi bahut dur thi or yah rasta bilkul bhi aasaan nahin tha
 Dinesh worked hard day and night without any means and facilities
 unke is parishram kii gavaah hai unki nani or gaanv ke log
 He has seen Dinesh practicing the game early in the morning and till late in the night
 tab koi is baat kii kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa tha ki ek chote se gaanv main garib parivaar main palaa-badha yah maamuli-sa ladkaa ek din safalataa kii aisi kahani likhegaa
 However, the economic problem becomes a major obstacle in front of the players preparing for the games by staying in the village and Dinesh also remained untouched by it
 bakaul dinesh, “jab bhi kisi khel pratiyogita main bhaag lene ke liye janaa padataa to hameshaa paison ke bare main sochataa tha
 There was absolutely no money in my pocket
 parivaar ke paas bhi itane sansaadhan nahin the ki ve meri madad kar pate
 Apart from this, whenever there was a need to take the kit etc
, trouble would arise
 ”dinesh kii samasyaon kaa kaaphi had tak samaadhaan 2004 main tab hua jab unka chayan spotars college lakhanu (guru govind singh sports college) main ho gaya
 Dinesh says, “initially i was worried about how to get my name written in a sports college
 vahaan admician milanaa bhi aasaan nahin tha, lekin mujhe lagata tha ki ek baar pravesh mil gaya to aage kaa rasta jarur aasaan ho jayega
 The doors of Dinesh's fortunes opened in 2007 when a company named Seven Figure from Florida, US came to India for a trial
 lakhanu or dilli main hue trial main dinesh pratham rahe, lekin mumbai main hue final main dinesh ne dwitiya sthaan praapt kiya
 Dinesh was also selected to do better in the competition along with Rinku who finished first and attracted the organizers by his ability
 utsaahi swar main dinesh kehete hai, “gend ko boundry paar karne ke maamle main main number van tha lekin aayojakon dwaara taiyaar paimaane ke anusaar main rhite jagah par gend nahin maar sakaa
 Instead of me, Rinku was chosen first after hitting the ball at the right place despite throwing the ball at short distance
 lekin mere achche pradarshan ke kaaran aayojakon ne rinku ke saath meraa bhi chayan kar liya
 It was a great achievement for Dinesh and his family
 unke gaanv or parivaar se to kya, puure desh se america ke itane bade sports club ke saath contract karne vaala vah pehla vyakti tha
 Within three to four months of moving to America, Dinesh contracted for the famous baseball club Pittsburgh Pirates
 phir kya tha dinesh kaa naam america besabaal kii duniya main chaa gaya
 Regarding this, Dinesh says, "after this two-year contract, i came to know what baseball really is
" is khel se jude jitne bhi upkaran or taiyaari ke liye jitani sari suvidhaayen maine vahaan dekhin apni puri life main nahin dekhi thim
 "dinesh says about the difference between the top sports in India and the US and the facilities available on it," i think that the facilities available in the US during this period are probably not available to the players even in sports like cricket, etc
 Here is the major game
 agar main kahuun to yahaan ke raashtrapati ko hi utani suvidhaayen milti hongi jitani vahaan ke khiladinnon ko milti hai
 Every month there is 60-70 thousand rupees
 milte the
 Apart from this, there was separate money for eating, drinking, living and traveling
 ”america besabaal club se do saal ke kontract ke khatme ke baad gaanv waapas aae or phir unhen do maheene ke liye usee america club kii taraf se china bheja gaya
 On April 20, 2012, Dinesh was sent to the MLB Center in China for two months
 dinesh ke anusaar vahaan par jaakar logon ko is khel se rou-ba-rou karaane kii jimmedaari unhen mili thi
 Dinesh, who returned two weeks before his trip to China, is gearing up for the national game, which is to be held in the next 10 months
 dinesh patel is baat ko lekar dukhi hai ki bharat main khele jane vaale khelon ke saath sarkaar dohari niti apanaati he
 He believes that the government treats all sports discriminately rather than giving them equal importance
 patel ke hi shabdon main, “kuch khelon ke liye hi sarkaar ke paas paise or yojanaayen hai
 Whereas the need is that the government should make plans to promote all sports
 ”unki nani kalavati ko aaj apane naati par bahut fakhr mahasoos hota he, lekin ek samay tha jab vah har samay khel main duube dinesh ko dekh gussa hoti thim
 During this time, when they were late to come home at night, they would have to scold granny
 unki nani ko shaayad is baat kaa dar rahata tha ki kahin unka laadla galat raah par to nahin ja rahaa he
 She says, "when Dinesh used to lie down at night, he used to get very angry and scolded a lot
 lekin aaj mujhe dinesh par garv he
 "dinesh has potential and quirks, but the need is that our governments should grace the players who are like lotus flowers in the mud
