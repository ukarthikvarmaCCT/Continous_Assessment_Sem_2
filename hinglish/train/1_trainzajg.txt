 People of other countries are at risk of destroying the people of Assam and their language, culture and tradition by settling here
 bahari logon ko naagarikta milane se unki aajeevika par bhi sankat khadaa ho jayega
 In fact, the issue of local versus outsider has always been effective in Assam, for which the Assam Accord was formed after the movement in the eighties

 gujarat sarkaar ne supreme court se kaha he ki wo ishrat jahaan encounter cese main aaropee dijipi peepi pandey ko hataayegi
 Pandey is accused in the Ishrat Jahan case of conspiracy, kidnapping and murder
 vartmaan main sibiai kii vishesh adaalat main mukadmaa chal rahaa he
 Pandey is running the service extension till 30 April by the central government
 pandey ne supreme court main patr daakhil kiya tha ki wo tatkaal apana pad chhodane ko taiyaar hai
 The Gujarat government told that PP Pandey himself wants to step down and the government has accepted his offer
 july 2013 main hue the giraftaar1980 batch ke ipies adhikari peepi pandey ishrat jahaan maamle main aaropee hai or duusare aaropee ipies diji vanjaraa ke saath jail main bhi rah chuke hai
 Vanzara is also currently out on bail
 july 2013 main sibiai ne is maamle main peepi pandey ko giraftaar kiya tha
 He was then posted as ADGP-CID (crime)
 farvari 2015 main unhen sibiai court ne unki jamaanat manjuur kii, jiske baad gujarat sarkaar ne unhen dobaaraa police seva main behaal karte hue edijipi (lau and order) pad saunpa tha
 The petition filed against the extension Yachikapande said that the government has deliberately ordered this to defuse the Ishrat encounter case and make Pandey DGP
 sibiai ke aarope patr main police adhikariyon ke jo bayaan he
 All those officers will be under Pandey's control
 isse aapraadhik prakaran main asar padana tay he
 The Supreme Court gave notice to the Gujarat government on the petition of retired IPS officer Julio Ribeiro
 yachika main kaha gaya tha ki peepi pandey ishrat jahaan samet kai cese main aaropee rahe hai, lekin sarkaar ne ritairement ke baad ekstansion dekar gujarat kaa kaaryakari DGP bana diya he
 Bebak / Oma the Aqaz In almost every third-fourth film, the use of slang or slang terminology towards women is increasing
 kabhi shekhar kapur (jo baad main hollywood fame ho gaye) ne bandit queen jaisi film banaakar 90 ke dashak main hindi cinema ko "maa-bahan" kii spasht galiyon kii saugat di or logon se gaali or tali donon pai
 But soon the time began to change and the first parallel films were abused
 phir satya jaisi mukhyadhara kii film main bhi stri yonsuchak apshabd aae or saraahe gaye
 Then the biggest contribution in this direction will be considered by Anurag Kashyap who changed the face of Hindi cinema so much that it is now the "trend" by serving violence, sexuality and profanity in the name of reality
 "sensor board" keval "dhumrapaan or jaanavar" dekhne main vyast rahata he (kabhi kabhi dharm or deshbhakti bhi)"gangs of vasepur" se shuru hua ye safar aaj "mirzapur" or "gandi baat" jaisi ghor hinsak or "maa-bahan-beti kii gaaliyon" se bhari ashleelata kaa paryaay ban gayi hai
 The people selling Purvanchal's evil-looking character as Purvanchal are also from the same eastern Uttar Pradesh and are against the sweetness of Bhojpuria there
 bhojpuri kaa naam aate hi "ashleelata or apshabd" aaj sabase pehle man par utarataa he
 At times Bhikhari Thakur's deep-sensitive songs, the magic of lyricists like Shailendra, Anjaan, kept the music of Bhojpuri films at par with mainstream Hindi-cinematic-music
 bharat sharma or sharada sinha ke gale or shabdon ke ras pidiyon ko dularate the
 The same Bhojpuri today has crossed all the limits of female insults from "humke hau chahi" or "nirhua sutal rahe" and is taking on Punjabi rap and Haryanvi pop in abusive language
 hani singh, badshaah jaise naam aaj karodo kaa vyapaar karne vaale wo "brands" hai jinhen safalataa hi "nari apmaan" kii keemat par mili he (or aaj bhi hinglish samskruti se mil rahi)kul mila kar aaj hindi geet-sangeet (or anya bhartiya bhashaaon main bhi) kii mukhyadhara main "nari-apmaan-suchak-shabdon kii bharmaar milti he
 Moreover, in the name of humor, standup comedy has a crowd of dirty young men and women doing dirty things
 aaj hatya, balaatkaar, shoshan, durghatana vagairah ko lekar ham utane hi sahaj ho gaye hai jitne ek sadi pehle tak "haije kii mahamari" yaa akaal ko le kar the
 Until a century before that, we used to have the same acceptance of kings and their atrocities
 natijatan, roj hazaron striyon ko nark bhogana pad rahaa he
 Every second-third morning, small pieces of twinkle, which have fallen victim to greed, are found
 kisi maasoom aarifaa kii nafrat main nochi hui laash milti he, kisi damini kaa daaman havas ke kafan main badalata dikhataa he to kisi nirbhaya kii darun-chitkaar maa kii surakshit kokh main soi bacchiyon tak ko bhaybheet kar detii he
 Is our role in those rapes excusable? Are we not creating the role of rape within ourselves and our society? We all provoke Nirbhaya's teen-killer with the behavior and business of these abusive words, that he should not only consume her sexual organs but also destroy them
 akele main andhere main mili ladki to item he
 Consumption item hinglish main "chiks" yaa "pikup"
 i cannot even write the words in hindi-urdu
 barason se yah baat main logon ko kahata aa rahaa hoon ki maan-bahan-beti kii gaali dena or balaatkaar karne main keval "tivrata" kaa antar he
 Only the "state" differs
 swaroop ek hi he
 In both we are "crushing the woman"
 bhale hi ham ise kitna bhi yantric karen hamaare chitt main "stri-hinsa" kaa sthaan banataa chalaa jaataa he
 Which monster comes out after tearing our moral-cover when it comes to a suitable opportunity
 premika ko "bich" yaa "hor" kahana america-samskruti se kab bhartiya shayankaksh main ghus gaya isaki padtaal bhi "naitik-sipaahiyon" ko kerani chahie jo praayah gulab or premapatron par chapa markar garvit hote rahete hai
 Remember "culture that takes decades to be born but becomes corrupt"
 ham aaj buree tarah bhrasht ho chuke hai
 In the country that created "kamasutra", "sex" was never "taboo", nor was it so expensive
 kintu is desh me "sex" junglee bhi nahi tha wo bahut "sofisticketed-parformens" thi
 There was a lot of "esthetics" in it
 tabhi to khajuraho or konark kaa vaibhav puure pashchim kaa aashcharya bana
 But today the same "immunity" has become antisocial
 pashchimi yon-aakraantata sahaj-sweekaarya!yaad kijiye nirbhaya ne kaha tha ki use gaali de de kar lutaa gaya tha
 Believe it happens ninety times out of a hundred
 balaatkaari keval daihik hinsa nahin kar rahaa hota apitu swayan ko utsahit karne ke liye (kyonki dushkarm main hamaari chetana sahyog nahi karti) gandi se gandi gaaliyon kaa (jo usne is samaaj or parivaar se sikhi) uskaa sahaara lete hue balaatkaar karata he
 When "force was the law" at that time, one clan used to make women and girls (sisters and daughters) fall prey to their lust and anger
 or use protsaahit karne ke liye aise bhadde or utejak naare lagaae jate the jo chitt kii pukaar ko dabaa sake
 And make even the normal man "curious" and barbaric towards female-sexual organs
 aaj wo "kabeelai samskruti" khatm ho gai par "kabeelai-maansikta" jas kii tas he
 In fact, "abuse" is oral rape
 atah keval yah maanakar ki "gaali" to "muhaavaron" kii shakl le chuki he yaa ek samskruti (kusanskruti) he or iskaa koi bada prabhaav nahi padataa, isaki upeksha kar dena bahut mahangaa pad rahaa he
 In this context, i often remember an incident of "mahabharata" when Lord Krishna cut off the head of a dumb king named Shishupala from his cycle when the "hundredth-profanity" was pronounced from his mouth to Krishna! Bhagavan informed history that by giving "death penalty" a response to verbal violence, there should be a limit to tolerate abuses in society
 gaali ko bhi hinsa kaa ek vikrut rup maanakar iskaa nirodh yaa pratirodh karnaa aavashyak hota he
 With the beginning of the campaign named "india Against Abuse", the time has come when we all should unite against this evil practice

 saamne ghat or simriya ghat jaise do ghat khandon main vibhajit is sangrah main kul 69 kavitaayen hai, jo ghaaton kii vividhta jaisi alag-alag roopakritiyaan liye hue hai lekin jaise har ghat kii vividh roopakritiyaan antat ek saanskrithik pravaah liye hue hoti hai, vaise hi ye kavitaayen bhi ek satat or sthir saanskrithik pravaah liye hue hai or vah he-jivan main nit prati uthne vaali hulchalon or tarangon kaa bodh, jo ramajna ke kavi ko ek aadhunik bhangima se bhar detaa he
 Just like the Ganges, the new waves, which break these poems, give a different personality to the poet
 sangrah kii pehali hi kavita he-kavita main dhan, jisamen kavi kahata he main dhan hum / kaagaj par uthaa hua / nae kavi kii / kavita main
 Paddy neither grows on stony ground nor in Usar
 vah ugta he dharti ke nami vaale kshetra main
 If the poet is growing on paper, then surely this paper is wet rather than dry
 kathor na hokar mulaayam he, sakht na hokar lacheela he
 This sense of moisture on paper makes the poet's chitwan humid on one side and hilarious on the other
 yah donon hi milakar maanviya karunaa ke jis bhav ko vyakt karte hai, vah kavi ko ek taraf valmiki ke vihval maanas se jodta he to duusari taraf kabir kii sangharkshil fakkadata se
 For this reason, this collection also provides a strict metaphor for the inhibiting elements of rice paddy
 sangrah main aisi bahut-si kavitaayen hai, jaise vidarbha, khet, sewagram, bunakar, chaukeedaar, bhukh, basmati geet, maanjhi jo kavi ke karunaa vigalit maanas ke saath uski vyapak saamaajik bechaini kaa pataa detii hai
 These poems suggest that a poet may endanger his poet to the extent of being self-inflicted
 devtaa banane se zyada manushya hone kaa sangharsh bhi dikhaai detaa he shashidhar kii kavitaaon main
 Overall, one can say that the poems of this collection have intellectual discipline but avoid the discomfort of showing dominance, which has become the craft of today's fake poems
 ye 'gaurav gadrai' na hokar adahan akulaai kavitaayen hai
 Poems that speak the language of the heart without speaking the language of the body

 tara chandra ko ‘pramanit darji’ kaa thappa to mil gaya lekin ise lekar unki ghabrahat-pareshaani chhupaae nahin chhupati
 This 'skill' with the name of Tara Chandra was added for stitching, without ever having to go to the training center
 wo training centre jo 15 july 2015 ko launch kiye gaepradhanmantri narendra modike bahuprachaarit kaarykram ‘skill india’ kaa hissaa he
 The record of the Integrated Skills Development Scheme (ISDS) of the Ministry of Textiles shows that Tara Chandra learned tailoring skills at the Modern Education Society in Sonepat
 iske liye tara chandra ko 13 sitambar ko baqayada praaanpatr bhi jari hua jiskaa number 17210867803 he
 Tara Chandra says, "I never took any training in sewing or embroidery (embroidery)
 maine rajmistre ke kaam ke liye saat din kii kaaryshaala main hissaa liya tha lekin kabhi banda training centre nahin gaya
 i don't know how to sew clothes
 ”‘skill india’ ke naam par bichauliyon ne kii thagiindia today kii jaanch se saamne aayaa he ki tara chandra akele nahin hai jinhen centre ke flagship kaarykram ke naam par bichauliyon ne thaga
 Middlemen also cheated two more people of Chaukin Purva village of Banda in the name of 'skill India'
 skill indiayani wo kaarykram jiske tahat 2022 tak 40 karod logon ko vibhinn hunaron ke liye prashikshat karnaa he
 Being a daily wage laborer, Rakesh is also a 'certified' tailor on paper
 rakesh bhi usee modern ajukeshan socity main prashikshu number 1507398 ke tahat bhartee dikhaaya gaya
 According to the website of ISDS, Rakesh was appointed on 5 February on a monthly allowance of Rs 6,500
 rakesh kaa kahana he, “main gujaarey ke liye mazdooree karata hum
 Someone else is making money using my name
 ” skill india kii sirf naam kii hi ek or labhaarthi anita devi hai
 She does not even know about her training in the center mentioned above
 23 sitambar 2017 ko jari kiye praaanpatr number 17210867810 ke bare main bhi anita devi kuch nahin jaanateen
 Anita Devi says, "he took all our information
 lekin kisi ne bhi hamen nahin bataaya ki kahaan or kab training karai jaani he
 My family is main bhi kaam kar sakati thi or kuch paise kama sakati thi
 "this is the objective of Skill India
 Ministries, non-governmental organizations (ngos), private stakeholders were joined together to achieve the goal that skill shortages in the country can be overcome
" iske liye logon ko public-privet partnership model ke tahat trend karne kaa rasta chunaa gaya
 Out of the sanctioned amount of Rs 10,000 for each trainee, the partner agencies are entitled to 75 per cent government subsidy
 lekin bichauliye sidhe-saadhe logon ke aadhaar number jaisi jaankariyon kaa istemaal kar unhen skill india ke labhaarthiyon kii tarah project kar rahe hai
 a similar picture appears from Banda's Atra tehsil
 ISDS ke tahat aadhikarik taur par pramanit darji ramanuj kehete hai, “chhedilal (bichauliya) meraa aadhaar card ye kah kar le gaya tha ki training ke baad meri naukari lagava degaa
 Three months later, i came to know that training had already taken place and my name was used
 ” ramanuj kaa praaanpatr number 17130665810 he
 According to this certificate, Ramanuja received training from Pune-based Maharashtra Academy of Engineering and Educational Research (MAEER) in 2016
 MAEER ke samanvay adhikari mahesh deshpandey skill india ke khule durupyog ko mahaz ‘galatfahami’ kah kar khaarij karte hai
 Deshpande says- "no, no, there is definitely a misunderstanding somewhere
 chaatr jo training ke liye aavedan karte hai, pariksha main baith sakate hai, mantralay unhen aankata he
 The certificate is prepared according to the coordination with the Aadhaar card
 usee ke baad mantralay kii ore se praaanpatr jari kiye jate hai
 "but the documents and witnesses in the reach of India Today TV have exposed the ongoing scam in the name of the scheme
 saamaajik kaaryakarta rubi zaynab alphija ke naam se enjio chalaati hai
 These ngos provide vocational training to the underprivileged in Aliganj, Banda
 rubi ko thagon ne ye vishwaas dilaa diya ki ve mahatvakankshi kaarykram kii hissedaar hai
 Once again, the name of the Modern Education Society came to light, which last year entrusted the responsibility of training 150 young women in tailoring
 rubi ne bataaya, “hamen yuvatiyon ko sikhaane ke liye kaha gaya
 He was also assessed by inspectors (associated with the Modern Education Society)
 ” rubi ke mutabik unhone sarkaar kii ore se pryojit yojana ko bharosemand maanate hue class lenaa shuru kar diya
 Suddenly, after four months, the inspector disappeared
 rubi ne kaha, “hamane kai chitthiyaan likhin, sarkari daftaron ke bhi chakkar lagaae lekin sab bekaar rahaa
 Now we get calls from the trainees
 ”rubi kaa kahana he ki jab se unhone mahilaon kii aadhaar card detail or photograph share kiye tab se inspectoron ne yahaan aana band kar diya
 Worried Ruby also filed an RTI petition in the ministry to know the status of the program
 23 agast ko mili jawaab ne rubi ko hilaa kar rakh diya
 The reply stated: 146 women have already taken training in their NGO
 inamen se 95 ko niyukti mil chuki he! haalanki naa to prashikshuon ko praaanpatr mili or naa hi rubi ko training ke sanchaalan ke liye koi bhugtan mila
 But the reply from RTI showed that the Modern Education Society had to run ISDS courses in different places
 12 karod rupye kaa motaa bhugtan kiya gaya
 Around 20 years old, Shabnam enrolled herself in an NGO
 shabnam kahati hai, “maine 50 saheliyon ke saath praaanpatr hasil karne, lone milane or antat: dukaane kholane kii ummid ke saath training kii thi
 i am desperate meri saheliyaan mujhase praaanpatr ke liye kahati rahati hai
 Mohinder Gaur, the then president of the Modern Education Society, denies any irregularity
 wo mantralay ke aankadon kaa hawala dekar kehete hai- “mantralay kii website par saare prashikshuon or placements kaa record maujuud he
 There is no question of any irregularity
 prashikshuon kii hajiri biomitric he or har baat kii nigaraanee hoti he

 Surjewala said, "thank you to India Today TV, the truth is that 100% of the money Modi sends is dishonest

 "AICC in-charge for Jharkhand RPN Singh also supported Surjewala's point

 'mahatma Gandhi struggled with many questions about the usefulness of charkha in his life time
 wardha main akhil bhartiya charkha sangh kii sitambar 1944 main huyi baithak main unhone kaha tha, 'congress ne charakhe ko sweekaar kiya, lekin kya usne ise apni marji se sweekaar kiya? nahin, vah meri khatir ise bardaasht kar rahi he
 ' yadi aap bhi regular padhai karne ke saath-saath compatishan kii taiyaari kar rahe hai

 Jailed DMK MP Kanimozhi told a Delhi court that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and then Finance Minister P
K
 chidambaram 2-ji spectrum license aavanton se puri tarah avgat the or unhone tatkaaleen doorsanchaar mantri e raja ke saath inaki nilaamee nahin karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 Appealing on behalf of Kanimozhi, senior advocate Sushil Kumar told Special CBI Judge OP Saini, "I am providing you the details of the meeting in which Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, then Finance Minister and Telecom Minister decided that the sale of licenses for 2G spectrum Or will not be auctioned
 maamle se aropamukt kiye jane kii maang karte hue 43 varshiya dramuk saansad ke vakil ne kaha ki sibiai kaa maamla is baat par aadhaarit he ki 2-ji spectrum ke liye licenson kii nilaamee nahin kar aaropee ne sarkari khajaane ko baari nuksaan pahunchaaya
 Kumar said, the prime minister, the then finance minister and the present telecom minister, are the right persons to prove as witnesses that no harm was done
 unhone sansad main kaha tha ki koi nuksaan nahin hua he
 Adding that what the CBI case hinges on does not lead to a legal process, Kumar said, "if there is no loss, then there will not be an allegation of fraud
" bachaav paksh ke vakil ne sibiai or mahaniyantrak evam lekha pareekshak ke nuksaan ke akalan ko bhi niraadhaar bataaya or kaha ki ye aaropee par mukadmaa chalaane kaa aadhaar nahin ho sakate
 The lawyer said the CAG report (1 to the government treasury)
 76 lakh karod rupee kaa nuksaan) sadan ke samaksh 16 navambar 2010 ko rakhi gai
 This was not accepted by the House
 yah ab bhi anishchit he ki sadan report ko sweekaar karegaa
 Kanimozhi's counsel also questioned the cbi's assessment of the loss of Rs 30,984 crore and said that there is no basis for it as the charge sheet said that the government could have earned more by auctioning the licenses
 bachaav paksh ke vakil ne kaha, ye shabd mukademe kaa aadhaar nahin ho sakate kyonki aarope patr main upyukt para purna myth he
 He argued that the sale of shares to foreign companies Etisalat and Telenor respectively was approved by the government by the alleged beneficiary of both Swan Telecom Private Limited and Unitech Wireless (tamil Nadu Private Limited) scam
 yah licenson kii bikri nahin thi or isliye koi nuksaan nahin hua
 The lawyer appearing for the daughter of DMK chief m Karunanidhi asked where did the sale (of licenses) take place? Where did the fraud happen? Kanimozhi was arrested by the CBI on May 30 for her alleged role in the scam
 bhrashtachar ke aaropon or dhokhadhadi tathaa 2-ji maamle main aapraadhik shadyantr ke aaropon ke virodh main unke tark ab bhi jari hai
 Kanimozhi is making the same arguments to absolve himself of charges as former Telecom Minister a Raja had given
 unhone bhi yah kahkar maamle main pradhanmantri or chidambaram ko ghaseetne kii maang kii thi ki spectrum licensodharakon dwaara hissedari kam kiye jane ke mudde par unke saath charchaa kii gai thi
 Judicial custody of Juvenile, accused of killing Pradyuman, a second-grader at Rayagan School in Gurugram, has been extended till January 30
 isse pehle 7 janvari ko aaropee kii jamaanat yachika khaarij kar di gai thi
 Along with this, a fine of 21 was also imposed on the accused for wasting the court's time
 16 varshiya aaropee chaatra reyaan international skool main hi 11veen main padhata tha
 On 20 December last year, the Juvenile Justice Board ordered the accused student to be tried as an adult
 mritak pradhyumna thakur ke pita varun thakur ne court se guhaar lagaai thi ki aaropee ko vayask maanakar uske khilaaf cese chalaaya jaae
 At that time, the government lawyer had argued in the court that senior clinics psychologist Dr
 joginder singh cairo ne aaropee ke saath paanch ghante samay gujaarne ke baad manovaigyanik report taiyaar kii thi
 After CBI took over the investigation of the case, Juvenile was charged with Pradyuman's murder, giving the case a new twist
 isse pehle is maamle main gurugram police ne skool ke bas conductor ashok kumaar ko mukhya aaropee banaate hue giraftaar kiya tha
 But the CBI, taking the investigation in its hand, gave the case a new twist and made Juvenile the main accused
 ashok ke khilaaf koi bhi saboot nahin mili the
 Ashok Kumar is currently out on bail

 (input ieenes se) In DTC buses, should the conductor roam inside the bus and collect the ticket while recovering money from the passengers or should the passenger from the conductor sitting on the seat take the ticket? This was a question on which the petition was filed in the Delhi High Court and the court has disposed of this petition after hearing it
 sunwaayee main is maamle main dilli sarkaar se jawaab daakhil karne ko kaha gaya tha
 The Delhi government told the High Court that it has made it mandatory for the conductors in cluster buses to go to the passengers to collect the fare, but this condition is not mandatory in the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses
 yah baat cluster bason ke saath hue samjhaute main bhi he
 In those buses the conductors have to go to the passengers and collect the fare and give them tickets
 aisa niyam tay karnaa sambhav nahin- courtditisi ne bhi court main apana paksh rakhte hue kaha ki uske conductor yatriyon se kiraaya lene or unhen tikat dene ke liye bas main nahin ghoomte hai
 After listening to the pleas of the Delhi government and the DTC, the court said that it is not possible to lay down any concrete rules in which it can be decided that the conductor should go to every passenger and give a ticket from the fare
 ditisi ne kaha ki vah conduktaron ko kiraaya lene or tikat dene sambandhi koi nirdesh jari karne ke paksh main nahin he
 The High Court disposed of the petition seeking to direct the conductors to recover the fare by walking around in the bus
 dilli hoicourt ne is maamle main 16 janvari ko dilli sarkaar or ditisi se jawaab maanga tha
 In the petition, the court was told that in the agreement between the government and bus owners, the conductor has been asked to cut the ticket by moving around
 iske baavjood conductor ek jagah baithkar tikat katata rahata he
 The government should make rules to ensure that the conductor turns around and cuts the ticket
 yachikakarta ke vakil jose abraham ne court se kaha tha ki qaraar ke baavjood conductor bas ke ek chor se duusare chor tak gum-gum kar tikat nahin katate hai or apane seat par baithkar tikat katate hai
 For this reason, people coming to Delhi from other states are often unable to collect tickets in the crowd and then have to pay a fine
 unhone kaha ki duusare rajya ke logon ko yah pataa nahin hota ki conductor ke paas jaakar tikat lenaa he
 Because of this, he is unable to take the ticket and has to pay a fine
 vakil jose abraham ne kaha ki isse bajurg, bacchon vaali mahilaayein or divyangon ko bhi kaaphi dikkat hoti he
 Because they have to go from one end of the bus to the other in the crowd and get a ticket
 jabaki duusare rajyon main conductor sabhi yatriyon ke paas jaakar tikat dete hai, phir dilli main aisa kyon nahin he
 The conductor sits on his seat and the passengers approach him and take the ticket
 ise dhyaan main rakhte hue court sarkaar ko nirdesh de ki vah conduktaron se kahe ki vah ghumkar sabhi yatriyon ko tikat kaatna sunishchit karen

 BJP President and Home Minister Amit Shah may have failed to form a BJP government in Maharashtra but the politics of forming a government has not stopped
 party ko ummid he ki shivasena-congress-ensipi gathbandhan main bahut jald hi khatpat shuru hogi or pad se vanchit vidhayak paala badalane main sankoch nahin karenge
 During the debate on the same day that Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray won the majority in the assembly, bjp's Chandrakant Patil had said that, Devendra Fadnavis will not sit in opposition for a long time and he will become the Chief Minister
 bhaajapa sutron kaa kahana he ki patil kaa yah bayaan anayas nahin he
 Actually, Patil made this statement in view of the future strategy of the BJP
 patil ke is bayaan ko tab adhik bal mila jab ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ne ek marathi tivi channel ko die saakshaatkaar main kaha tha ki, sansad main piem se mulaakaat ke dauraan modi kii taraf se yah kaha gaya ki, maharashtra main ham saath kaam kar sakate hai
 However, Pawar said that he denied it but it was clear from Pawar's statement that the BJP has kept the option of joining the NCP open to form the government
 maharashtra bhaajapa ke ek netaa kaa kahana he ki, party jaldbaaji main kuch nahi karne ja rahi he
 However, it is true that the party has options to form a government
 bas samay kii baat he
 The BJP is following the policy of weight and watch
 chandrakant patil kehete hai ki, bhaajapa jod-tod nahin kar rahi he na karegi
 But if any leader of any party wants to come to BJP, then the party will consider it
 aakhirkaar, shivasena, ensipi or congress ke vidhayak yah jaanate hai ki yah sarkaar mandent ke khilaaf he
 a central leader of the BJP says that the example of Karnataka is in front of everyone
 rajya main mandent bhaajapa ko mila tha lekin congress, jedies ke saath chali gai or mandet ko dhata bataate hue sarkaar bana lee
 a few days later the government began to waver
 donon hi dalon ke vidhayakon ne party ko chhodana shuru kiya or bhaajapa ke samarthan main utarate chale gaye
 After which by-elections were made
 up-chunaav hone par karnataka main bhaajapa ko badi safalataa mili or ek sthir sarkaar ke liye logon ne bhaajapa ko purna bahumat de diya
 People of Maharashtra know that the Shiv sena-ncp-congress government has come together for mutual benefit
 The day the conflict of interest starts, it will not be late to break the alliance
 bhaajapa sutron kaa kahana he ki shiv-sainik jo varshon se congress or ensipi ke khilaaf ladate rahe hai vah man se niraash hai
 Uddhav will have to compromise to save the government due to the alliance, this will further increase the resentment of Shiv Sainiks and in such a large number of mlas and party officials will not delay in leaving the Shiv Sena
 bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai ki vaicharik rup se ek duusare ke tikhe virdohi partiyon kii sarkaar bahut dinon tak nahin chal paati he
 When the BJP formed a government with PDP in Jammu and Kashmir, it could not run for a long time
 isi tarah bihar main jab nitish kumaar ne lalu yadav ke saath mil kar sarkaar banaai to bade bahumat ke baad bhi sarkaar nahin chal saki
 In Maharashtra, Shiv Sena has reached this stage after fighting both NCP and Congress
 ab unhi ke samarthan se bani sarkaar kitna din chalegi yah dekhne vaali baat he
 *** bihar main sipaahi bhartee pariksha ke dauraan 140 se adhik farji parikshaarthiyon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he

 One person is arrested while giving examination instead of the other
 ek police adhikari ne kaha, giraftaar ke baad sabhi ko sthaneey adaalat main pesh kiya gaya, jiske baad unhen saat dinon kii nyaayayik hiraasat main bhej diya gaya
 Rana said that the gang involved in this crime uses techniques
 unhone kaha, 'giraftaar logon ke paas blue tooth se judane vaale mobile phone baraamad kiye gaye hai
 According to police officials, the arrested people said that they had to be paid three to four lakh rupees per examiner to take the exam

 input : ieenes Shiv Sena MP Anil Desai had to go through an uncomfortable situation on Sunday
 ravivaar subah anil desai ke paas matoshri se phone aayaa ki unhen dilli janaa he cabinet mantri ke taur par shapath lene
 Just a day before this, Desai told reporters that he would not go to Delhi
 aakhirkaar desai dilli to gaye lekinairport se hi waapas mumbai ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye
 According to Shiv Sena sources, on Sunday morning, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray received a call from BJP President Amit Shah
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki shah se baat hone ke baad uddhav ne desai ko dilli ravaanaa hone ke liye kaha
 Anil Desai looked set to become a cabinet minister
 desai ravivaar subah patni ke saath dilli ke liye ravaanaa bhi ho gaye, lekin puraa ghatnakram achaanak se badla or desai ko dilli airport par hi rukne ko kaha gaya he
 While speaking to reporters, Thackeray also admitted that he had prevented Desai from going to the oath
 darasal bijepi ne shivasena ko kaha kianil desai ko rajya mantri banaaya jayega
 Six months after this, Shiv Sena will be given the post of another Minister of State
 yahaan tak baat banati hui najar aa rahi tha, lekin shivasena pramukh sabase zyada aahat, shivasena ke purv saansad suresh prabhu ko cabinet mantri banane ke faisle se hue
 Though the BJP had told the Shiv Sena that Prabhu was being inducted into the cabinet by keeping him out of the Shiv Sena quota, the way Prabhu left the party membership without telling the Shiv Sena and joined the BJP, it hurt Thackeray a lot
 gauratlab he ki railmantri banaae gaye suresh prabhu ne shapath grahan ke hi din shivasena chhodkar bijepi kii sadsyta lee
 This case again brought the Shiv sena-bjp alliance leading to the patchup, closer to the breakup
 bijepi ne maharashtra main satta ke samikarnon par abhi apane pattey nahin khole hai
 The Shiv Sena, on the other hand, wants several posts in Maharashtra, including the Home Ministry
 shivasena ko ummid thi ki modi cabinet vistaar ke madhyam se shivasena ko khush karne kaa prayaas karenge
 The BJP had different motives and brought Modi's favorite Prabhu to her party from the Shiv Sena and also gave him the status of Union Minister
 is bich anil desai dilli airport par matoshri se agle aadesh kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 The order came that he should return to Mumbai
 mumbai airport par shivasena samarthakon ne desai kaa swaagat kiya
 Fatigue and anger were seen together on Desai's face
 desai ne patrakaron se kaha, 'main sirf uddhav ji kii baat rakhane or bijepi ke niyantran kaa sammaan rakhane ke liye gaya tha lekin jab unhone hamaari koi baat hi nahin suni to vahaan jane kaa matlab hi nahin thi
 ' pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ke varanasi se chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa ke baad ek taraf jahaan raajnneetik partiyon main halchal tej ho gai he vahiin satta bazaar bhi garma gaya he
 However, compared to Modi, Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal is still low
 narendra modi par jahaan 'ek kaa do' bhav chal rahaa he vahiin arvind kejariwal kaa bhav 'ek kaa teen' he
 Not only this, even after leaving the seat of Varanasi for Modi and then fighting Murali Manohar Joshi on him, a bet of Rs 50 lakh has been imposed so far
 modi yahaan se kitne vot se jeetenge, isapar bhi satorie karodon kaa satta lagaae hue hai
 The twenty-twenty World Cup is going on at the moment, but after the announcement of Narendra Modi's claim from Varanasi, only the elections have been overshadowed in the speculative market
 yahaan tak ki booth ke hisaab se bhi satta lagaaya ja rahaa he
 The number of votes Modi will get in Muslim areas is also being speculated
 modi yahaan se lagbhag dhai lakh maton se jeetenge, ise lekar karodon rupee kaa satta laga he
 Speculators are betting on how much Narendra Modi will get in Gujarat
 ek sattebaaj ke mutabik teen dinon main 15 karod se upar kaa satta lag chukaa he
 Bookies from Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata have appointed their representatives in Varanasi due to Modi contesting from here

 After the hearing, the court said, "neither the Delhi government did anything nor the Center paid attention to it
" yadi kuch kiya hota hodilli main pradooshanke halaat aise kharaab nahin ho chuke hote
 'the court said in a bitter manner that all the agencies are still not ready to take lessons
 dilli sarkaar ne saunpa ection plancourt kii kaarywahi ke dauraan dilli sarkaar ne adaalat main vaayu pradooshan ko lekar apana ection plan saunpa
 It explains what she is doing immediately and taking some steps towards this
 iske saath hi arvind kejariwal kii saraakar ne lambey samay se judi yojanaon kaa praaroop bhi court ke saamne rakhaa
 It is to be noted that from 1 January 2016, the Delhi government is coming to Delhi with the formula of operating even and odd trains
 haalanki, sarkaar abhi ise trial ke aadhaar par 15 dinon ke liye bhi chalaaegi, jisaki samiksha ke baad ise purna taur par lagu kiya jayega
 The court had given instructions that on December 3, the Delhi High Court had earlier expressed concern over the level of air pollution in the national capital
 is dauraan adaalat ne tippanee kii ki rashtriya rajdhani main pradooshan kaa vartmaan str chintajanak sthiti tak pahunch gaya he or yah gas chembar main rahane jaisaa he
 The court had directed the Central and Delhi governments to submit detailed action plans to deal with the rising levels of pollution
 justise badar durej ahamed or justise sanjeev sachdeva kii bench ne paryaavaran mantralay or dilli sarkaar dwaara daayar kaary yojanaon ke bare main kaha tha ki ye vistrut nahin hai, kyonki inamen har praadhikaran kii spasht jimmedaari or inhen karne ke liye samaysima nahin he

 The court directed the Center and the Delhi government to ensure that no building or road is constructed without first ensuring minimum dust
 court ne dilli sarkaar ko yah sunishchit karne kaa bhi nirdesh diya ki neshnal green tribunel ke nirdesh ke mutabik, logon dwaara khule main kooda or pattiyaan nahin jalaai jaaen
 The bench directed the city administration to provide information about the ban on such activities through print, audio and visual media
 desh main belgaum ho rahi petrol or dijal kii keemat ko kam karne ke kendra sarkaar kii apil ke baad gujarat sarkaar ne petrol-dijal par vasule jane vaale apane waite main badi katautee kaa elaan kiya he
 After the cabinet meeting of the state government, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has decided to cut 4% VAT in the price of petrol and diesel in the state
 is faisle se rajya main petrol kii keemat main 2
 There was a decrease of Rs 93 and now the price of 1 liter petrol in the state is 67
 03 rupee hogi
 This price will be applicable from 12 left tonight
 isi tarah rajya main dijal par 4 fisadi waite kii katautee ke baad keemton main 2
 There will be a decrease of 72 paise and now diesel 60
 77 rupee prati litre bikega
 It is worth noting that recently, the central government announced a reduction of Rs 2 per liter in exide duty by slashing its coffers at Rs 26,000 crore per year after coming under pressure from rising prices
 ise bhi padhein: 80 par aansu mat bahaaen, abhi 100 rupee tak pahonchega petrol! yahaan samajhen ganitis elaan se aam aadmi ke liye petrol or dijal main prati litre 2 rupee kii katautee hui
 Now the central government has made preparations to pressurize the state governments to further cut the prices of petrol and diesel
 ise bhi padhein: khatm hue kachche tel kii keemton ke achche din, sarkaar ko dar kahin rulaa na de daily prising formulasutron ke mutabik kendriya petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan sabhi rajya sarkaron ko patr likhakar apil kar chuke hai ki vah bhi petrol-dijal par liye jane vaale state tex main katautee kaa elaan karen
 Now if the state governments cut their tax on petrol and diesel, then the common man will get some relief from the rising prices of these essential fuels
 gauratlab he ki rajya sarkaron par dabaav banane ke liye kendriya petroleum mantri rajya ke mukhyamantriyon se bhi mulaakaat kar rahe hai
 In this sequence, in the Pradhan last week, he met Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in Patna and appealed to reduce the VAT being charged on petrol and diesel in the state by at least 5%
 haalanki pradhan ne mulaakaat ke baad kaha tha ki bihar sarkaar ko rajya main sharabbandi ke baad se rajasav kaa bada nuksaan ho rahaa tha
 Despite this, the Modi government hopes that keeping in mind the interests of the common man, Nitish Kumar will take a decision to reduce VAT on petrol and diesel by 5%

K
 chidambaram ne vaada kiya ki agar party ko agali sarkaar banane kaa mauka mila to yah matadaataaon ke 'samruddhi or kalyaan' donon hi lakshyon ke liye kaam karegi
 Chidambaram headed the manifesto drafting committee
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne ghoshnaptr ko avyaavhaarik bataate hue ise khaarij kar diya
 But given the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi exaggerating during the elections, it is likely that he will be accused of announcing non-implementation announcements
 congress kaa nyaay (nunatam aay yojana) ek bada vichaar he
 It is a matter of ensuring that the monthly income of any household in the country will not be less than Rs 6,000
 is tarah kareeb 5 karod parivaar salanaa takreeban 72,000 rupye ke nakad hastantaran ke paatr ban jaaenge
 This makes about 3 on the government treasury
 6 lakh karod ru
 And it is equal to two percent of India's current gross domestic product (GDP)
 yah bhugtan kis tarah kiya jayega, ghoshnaptr main isaki puri tarah se vyakhya nahin kii gai he
 Although it is a manifesto, not a budget
 congress ne iske liye ek ruparekha bhi taiyaar kii he or is yojana main ek saal lagegaa
 This includes designing and testing it
 uske baad is yojana ko shuru kiya jayega or kai charnon main lagu kar diya jayega
 Congress believes that the cost of justice in the first year will be less than one percent of GDP and in the second year it will cost less than two percent
 jaise-jaise bharat kaa jidipi badhata jayega, zyada se zyada parivaar garibi rekha se baahar nikalate jaaenge, jidipi ke anupaat main nyaay kii laagat ghatati jaaegi
 This Congress document says, "if BJP gets 1 lakh crore rupees for bullet train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad
 se adhik kaa nivesh kar sakati he, to kya saamaajik nyaay sunishchit karne ke liye apane jidipi kaa ek ansh nahin diya ja saktaa?'' garibi unmoolan or desh ke sabhi logon ko aarthik vikaas kaa laabh sunishchit karnaa, congress ke ghoshnaptr ke centre main he
 Former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan admitted in a conversation with reporters that he had talked to Congress President Rahul Gandhi about justice
 unhone kaha ki yah yojana samaaj ko adhik samaveshi banane kii disha main ek mahatvapurn kadam he
 Rajan currently teaches at a prestigious business school at the University of Chicago
 unhone is yojana ko 'ullekhneey' bataate hue kaha ki yah sabase garib bhartiya ko bhi arthvyavastha main apana yogadan karne main sakasham banaaegi
 This manifesto is an attempt to reassure voters who felt neglected in the Modi government
 congress jataana chaahati he ki uski sarkaar ke tahat aarthik vikaas kaa dayera bahut vyapak hoga
 The Congress has divided its agenda into six main themes — Kama (employment), Daam (economic development that targets all), Shan (india's Proud of soft and hard power), good governance (good governance through independent, accountable and strong institutions), self-respect (self-respect for the economically disadvantaged) and respect (a life of honor for all )
 darasal, congress ke ghoshnaptr main yah darshane kii koshish hui he ki bhaajapa jahaan vibhaajan kii baat karti he, to congress sabko ekta ke sutara main pirokar saath lekar chalane kii baat karti he
 As expected, all BJP leaders, including Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, in one voice called the manifesto 'dangerous'
 congress ne vaada kiya he ki vah rajdroh kanoon ko khatm karegi jiskaa istemaal vaastavik rajdroh ko rokane kii bajaae sarkaar aksar apni aalochana kii aawaaj ko khamosh karne ke liye karti he
 It has also promised a review of the Armed Forces Privilege Act (AFSPA) giving special powers to the armed forces in Kashmir and several northeastern states
 is kanoon ko maanavadhikaron ke ulanghan kaa jariya bataakar lambey samay se isaki aalochana kii jaati rahi he
 AFSPA is an important issue in Kashmir and many northeastern states
 congress kaa kahana he ki aarthik raahat to uske bade agenda kaa keval ek hissaa bhar he
 The party claims that the atmosphere of perceived fear that the BJP has created across the country will liberate from that environment
 dekhnaa yah he ki congress matadaataaon ko kis tarah samajha paati he ki ghoshnaptr main kiye gaye vaadon ko lekar vah puri tarah gambhir he or unhen lagu karegi

 If the war ends, one is immersed in the joy of winning, and one is in the misery of losing

 But in Syria, the government also has its own, the country also has its own and the people have their own
 phir bhi apane hi haakim ne apane hi desh kii janata par aasmaan se aisa jehar barsaaya ki pal bhar main sau se zyada log maut ke munh main samaa gaye
 We are talking about the chemical attack in Syria
 syria main rasinic hamalakate hai kilkareiyon ko muskuraahat dena bhi kisi ibaadat se kam nahin he
 But when the breath becomes murderer, the killers do not resonate but are suffocated
 or yahi hua syria ke ek shahar ke saath
 The whole city was asleep and got up
 ek rocket dhire se shahar ke asaman main daakhil hua
 The rocket fell to the ground
 rocket se gas nikali or phir dekhte hi dekhte logon kii saanson main aisi ghuli ki saikadon saansen ruk gayi
 This was a chemical weapon attack in Syria
 jise rocket se anjaam diya gaya tha
 The date of the accident of death from the sky saw such a dreadful scene of death from the sky that the spectators of the bus were shivering
 insaanon ke banaae sabase khatarnaak or jaanaleva hathiyaar ko insaanon par hi aazamaaya ja rahaa tha or aazamaaish aisi ki minuton main laashon ke dher lag gaye
 No one knows when the torrential rain hit the sky, swallowing more than a hundred people in one stroke
 duniya ne rasinic bam kaa khoonkhaar cheharaa phir ek baar dekha
 The death of children ravaged by death was not ordered by anyone else but by the Syrian president himself
 insaanon kii banaai is duniya main insaanon ke hi haathon banaae gaye is khaufnak hathiyaar yani rasaounik bam ko apane hi logon par giraane kaa hukum unka apana hi netaa de rahaa tha
 But the easiest victims of this chemical attack were the small children who had just stepped into this world of elders
 bacchon ko saans lene main sabase zyaada dikkat hone lagi or jo jahaan tha vahiin behosh hone laga
 First it stung and then the blood started to vomit and within a few minutes the breath started to break
 aspataal laachaar or biimaar logon se pat gaye
 An attempt was made to give breath to the children through medical methods
 lekin is jaanaleva gas ke aage kisi kaa jor nahin chalaa
 Some people responsible for the chemical attack resorted to cold water to reduce the heat of gas
 jisase fori raahat to mili, lekin zindagi kam hi ko mili
 The US, along with the organizations working for human rights in Syria, is believed to be behind the attack, but not the Syrian President Bashar al-assad himself
 haalanki khud syrian fuj ke saath-saath unke raashtrapati bashar al asad ke haq main vidrohiyon par hamalaa karne vaale rus ne in ilzaamon sire se khaarij kar diya
 Rather, Russia issued a statement revealing that the attack was of course carried out by the Syrian army, but it was not a chemical attack
 balki fuj kii missile khan shikhaoon main rasaynic hathiyaaron se bhare aatankwaadiyon ke sabase bade godaam main giri or ye haadasa ho gaya
 That is to say, rebels and terrorists are not responsible for this attack, but the Syrian army
 avam ke khilaaf farmanshak he ki duniya main sabase zyada rasinic hathiyaar isi syria ke paas hai
 And the people of Syria are currently on the streets against their own leader
 usee sadak par avam kii aawaaj kuchalane ke liye usee avam ke leader ne aasmaan se zehar barasaane kaa kaam kiya he
 What is chemical weapon
 kyon hai ye itnaa zaharila
 How does it take life or kyon syria ke logon par rasinic hathiyaar kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 Its entire story will keep you restless
 syria main maut kii subahamadhya purv ke mulk syria main is baar jo hamalaa hua, vah haal ke tamaam hamalon se alag tha
 Because no one was killed or injured in this attack, but still the corpses were spread across the city
 ye ek aisi maut thi, jo hawa kii shakl main dabe paanv syria main pahunchi or saanson main ghul kar laashen bichaate hue aage nikal gai
 When the nation, which was scorched in the fire of civil war, opened its eyes at around eleven and half in the morning of April 4, 2017, death was waiting for them
 idhar, ek ke baad ek rocket se shahriyon par kai hamale hue or udhar bastiyaan-dar-bastiyaan shmashaan main tabdeel hone lagi
 Innocent and uninformed people started moleting death
 1980 ke baad doosraa khaufnak hamalakya bachche, kya buudhe or kya jawan
 This attack did not spare anyone
 isse pehle ki log samaj pate ki ye maajaraa kya he, kisi kii saans ruk gai to kisi kii ankhon ke saamne andhera chaa gaya
 Because this attack is not a minor attack, but was the second most dreaded chemical attack in the world after 1980
 wo hamalaa, jisane takreeban sau se zyaada logon kii jaan le lee
 While a large population of chemical attack Syria has been on the streets for a long time against the President Bashar al-assad there, but they have to pay such price for the President's opposition, which nobody had even imagined
 ilzaam he ki sarkaar ke ishaare par sena ne bich shahar main zahreeli gaison se las rocket daage or palak jhapakate puure khan shekhaun main koharaam much gaya
 Bullets and explosions are nothing new for the Syrian people, who have been embroiled in the war of right and wrong for years
 lekin mangalvaar kii subah jo kuch hua, vaisaa isse pehle kabhi nahin hua tha
 People had just started their day when the poisonous gas emitted from the rocket started to suffocate them
 
 
 
 And then stopped breathing, the first effect of this attack was that people started having trouble breathing
 tej jalan ke maare ankhon ke saamne andhera chaane laga, putaliyaan choti hone lagi or zyaadaatar log faqat das minute ke andar maut ke munh main samaa gaye
 The worst is the case of children, who before they understand something, have moved away from the world
 jin logon kii haalat thodi behatar thi, unhone biimaar logon ko aspataal pahanchana shuru kiya or dekhte hi dekhte shahar ke tamaam chode-bade aspataal rasaynic hamale ke shikaar logon se pat gaye
 The doctors' hands and feet swelled up
 haalat ye ho gai ki ye samaj aana mushkil ho gaya ki wo kiskaa ilaaj karen or kise choden or isi aanan-faanan main kai or zindagiyaan khamosh ho gayi
 The Bahujan Samaj Party supremo has argued for not compromising with respect for the poor of Dalit, minority and upper castes, saying that his party had laid the only condition for getting 'respectable seats' for the electoral alliance
 isse matlab hua ki gathbandhan membespasiton ke liye 'bheekh' nahin maangegi or apane balboote par hi chunaav ladati rahegi
 Addressing party workers on Mayawati on Tuesday after paying tribute to BSP founder Kanshi Ram on his death anniversary, he held the BJP and Congress equally responsible for the plight of the poor of Dalit, minority and upper caste society
 mayawati ne madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke saath gathbandhan nahin karne ke liye basapa ko sammanjanak siten nahin milane ko pramukh vajah bataaya
 He said, 'though there is no expectation of widespread interest and respect of these classes from BJP and Congress, but we cannot tolerate their insult too
 mayawati ne kaha ‘ham jaanate hai ki naa to bijepi or naa hi congress bahujan samaaj or savarna samaaj ke garibon kii hitaishi party he
 If they had been friendly, the social, political, economic and educational condition of these classes would not have been so pathetic today but would have improved a lot in the last 70 years and they would have had proper participation in power
 ’mayawati ne bijepi or congress par baraabar nishaanaa sadhate huye basapa ko kamjor karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 He said, 'both the Congress and the BJP are always trying to weaken, discredit and politically weaken the BSP and its leadership
 khaskar chunaav ke samay to yah kutsit prayaas or bhi zyaada saghan or vifaille ho jate hai
 'he also warned party workers to be wary of this
 basapa pramukh mayawati ne bijepi par anusuchit jati-janajati atyaachaar nirodhak kanoon ke durupyog kaa aarope lagaate huye kaha ‘basapa katai nahin chaahati he ki kisi bhi kanoon kaa, chaahe vah SC / ST kaanoon hi kyon naa ho, sarkari mashinari ke haathon durupyog ho
 Mayawati said that this fact has been proved by the BSP government in Uttar Pradesh four times, when the government used to show standing with the Majloom
 mayawati ne kaha ki rajya kii vartmaan bijepi sarkaar daliton par julm karne waalon kaa saath de rahi he or yah puure rajya main ho rahaa he tathaa isse mukti paanaa jaruri he

 Efforts are being made that are acceptable to all Congress mps and mlas
 unhone kaha ki anya raajnneetik dalon ko bhi is tarah ke prayaas karne chahie
 For example, Telugu Desam should also do so
 vah sabhi telugu desham sadasyon main ekta laakar sabhi ko sweekaarya samaadhaan khoje

 In the current year also, the Indian Navy saw the Yuan class submarine in the Indian maritime sector
 2017 main china ne ye pehali pandubbi is kshetra main bheji
 It is a matter of concern for India that along with the presence of warships, hydrographic, oceanographic boats, spy ships are also being deployed in Indian seas to measure the sea level
 bathimitric data bhi un chizon main shaamil he jinke jariye pataa lagaaya jaataa he ki ek gaharaai vishesh main pani kii dhara or aawaaj kis tarah kaa bartaav karti hai

" "kya sikkim ke doklam kshetra main chal rahe gatirodh sepandubbiyon kii tainaatika koi sambandh he? kaha ja saktaa he ki do ghatnaayen aapas main judi nahin he
 But China's growing presence in the Indian maritime sector, building military outposts claiming to gain land from the sea, setting up advance military bases on the islands, road construction efforts in the Doklam plateau are all points that point towards China's overall aggression

 Meanwhile, in the presence of Pranab Mukherjee, Sangh chief Bhagwat also explained the new RSS

 Addressing the concluding function of rss's third year education class, Mohan Bhagwat said, 'we gave an invitation to Pranab Mukherjee with a smooth gesture and he accepted it with ease
 unako kyon bulaayaa or vah kaise ja rahe hai, yah charchaa nirarthak he

 Let us know that in the Delhi Test, Team India has decided to bat first after winning the toss, Indian batsmen had no problem in scoring runs on this wicket
 suranga lackmal ne haalanki kuch acchhee genden jarur daali lekin wo bhartiya ballebajo ko zyada dikkat nahin de sake

 In July this year, a group of 20 Chinese women arrived in London

 Soon she became the subject of curiosity of all the people there
 unke trekksoot par chini neshnal vimen cricket team kaa logo chamak rahaa tha
 Many did not even know that there is such a team
 team main kai uniwarsity chatraayen thim jinhen pehali baar cricket kaa balla uthaae abhi saal bhar bhi nahin hua tha
 The first match was in Berkshire County
 bhale hi vahaan sirf angrej darshak aate rahe hon phir bhi match ko lekar khaasi utsukata thi
 It was a new thing to see the Chinese team playing cricket
 unke khilaaf barkshaayar county ladies ilevan ne apni sabase majboot team bhi nahin utaari thi or chini yuvatiyaan videshi halaat main khud ko dhaalane ke liye jaddojahad kar rahi thim
 He prepared for the tour on artificial turf plains in northeastern China with hot and dry weather
 chini team ne 20 overon main paanch wicket par 110 ranon kaa score banaaya
 When Berkshire's team came to the crease to bat, chasing this score did not prove to be as easy as they thought
 mehmaan team ne bahut anushaasan ke saath kasi hui gendbaaji kii or ghaas ke maidan par gend lapakane ke liye jaan ladaa di
 The Berkshire team somehow managed to score 109 runs and lost by one run to their Chinese guests
 agle ek maah main china kii team ne awwal darje kii angrej tiimon ke khilaaf khelte hue puure england kaa daura kiya
 In the Lord's also known as the Mecca of Cricket, he played against the Women's team of Merrillbon Cricket Club (MCC)
 unhone nau match khele or unamem se aath main fatah hasil kii
 There is no history of cricket in China
 zyaadaatar chiniyon ne bain-chio yaa bat-ball ke bare main kabhi suna bhi nahin tha
 They knew of a similar 'bangchio' or baseball
 aakhirkaar 2005 main china kaa cricket se aupchaarik parichay karavaaya gaya
 The newly formed Chinese Cricket Association (CCA) then organized a coaching course in Beijing that same year
 us pehle course se hi cricket ko badhaava dene ke abhiyaan se jude rahe sisie ke cricket manager terry jhang kehete hai, “main jitne logon ko jaanata tha unamem se ek ko bhi us jamaane main pataa nahin tha ki cricket aakhir kis bhalaa kaa naam he
 Then the teachers giving physical education started the game in their schools
 agle hi saal pehla rashtriya toornament yojit kiya gaya
 Of this, CCA selected the under-15 first men's national team
 isisi se mili jabardast samarthan ke boote par chini prashaskon ne fouran elaan kar diya ki ve 2020 tak china ko cricket vishwa cap main pahunchaa denge
 This claim was however made in a little haste
 purush team tabhi se jeet ke liye khaasi jaddojahad karti dekhi gai
 He faced many humiliating defeats
 unki sabase buree haalat 2009 ke asian cricket council (asisi) toornament main hui
 He played and lost three matches against countries like Iran, Thailand and Maldives (not a single cricket giant)
 pehle match main team iran se 307 ranon se haari, thailand ne sirf 37 ranon par unki puri team ko chalata kar diya or 8 wicket se haraaya
 Maldives defeated them by 315 runs
 sisie ke secretary general song yingchun ne ek intervyuu main mana, “2006 main jarur aisi yojanaayen thim ki 2020 tak vishwa cap main dastak di jaae
 It did not happen as thought
 ” cricket kaarykram kii kaman ab song ke haathon main he or ve ise thik karne kii mahatvakankshi yojanaon par kaam kar rahe hai
 Song was earlier entrusted with the responsibility of promoting tennis and golf by the government, and was successful in both of these initiatives
 yahaan tak ki mahila tennis star lee naa kii khoj main bhi unka haath rahaa
 Ever since she was just eight years old, he has been helping her in her career development

 China has also produced many young golfers who are making their mark in the world tour
 sarkaar ko ummid he ki song cricket ke vikaas main bhi aisi hi kamyaabi hasil karenge
 Song told India Today that his plans to build the first international cricket stadium dedicated to cricket in Beijing topped
 ve bataate hai, “iskaa kaam chal rahaa he
 i want to build one or two international cricket grounds in Beijing if possible
 hamane asisi se is bare main baat kii he
 They are willing to give us technical help
 china main ek antarrashtriya toornament yojit karnaa jaruri he taaki khel ke prati aakarshan ko badhaayaa ja sake
 "they absolutely want to promote the game at the ground level and also bring in international coaches
 china main cricket ke vikaas ke liye sabase badi chunauti sambhawatah vah sarkari niti he jisamen sara dhyaan sirf olympic khelon par diya gaya he
 Ever since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, its leaders have preferred that the country win as many Olympic medals as possible
 2008 main beijing main olympic khelon ke aayojan ke saath medalon kii yah deewangi or bhi zyada bad gai
 Now it has become a national obsession that China under any circumstances win more gold medals than America
 nateeja yah hua ki gaiyr-olympic khelon ko paryaapt samarthan or madad nahin mil saki
 Says Zhang, "if cricket comes to the Olympics, then we will see a transformation of this sport in China
" ” ve rugby kii misaal dete hai jo 2016 olympic se vaapasi karegaa
 While the cricket team practices on turf fields, the rugby players are trained on grass fields
 tay karne hai kai mukamcricket un khelon kii jagah to nahin le saktaa jinhen chini junun kii had tak chaahate or khelte hai—teble tennis, badminton, footbal or ab besabaal
 But Chinese officials believe that China will benefit from learning cricket as Asia is the dominant sport
 uske cricket project ke liye vastav main kai chunautiyaan saamne khadi hai, lekin khel ke nau saal ke safar ke dauraan sabase acchhee baat yah hui he ki chini mahila team ne bahut teji se tarakkee kii he
 Her women's team, which debuted in 2007, has not had much time yet, but she embraced the sport very quickly
 chini purush or mahila, donon hi tiimon ke coach or purv pakistani cricketer raashid khan kehete hai ki unamem sudhaar kii raftaar ‘sachmuch dekhne laayak’ he
 In an interview with India Today, he said, "seven years ago neither of them knew how to hold the bat or how to grip the ball
 ” yah intervyuu unase uttar-purvi liyaoning praant ke shenyang main team ke ek prashikshan shivi ke dauraan pichley maheene us vakt liya gaya tha jab ve dakshin korea main asian khelon ke liye ravaanaa hone vaale the
 Between 2011 and 2014, the Chinese women's team reached the finals of three ACC tournaments
 khan bataate hai, “koi chah saal pehle jab hamane pehali baar honkong ke saath match khelaa tha tab ham bade antar se haar gaye the
 When we played the match with the same team last year, we beat them by a much bigger margin
 ” aktubar kii shuruyaat main dakshin korea main hue asian khelon main mahila team itihaas banane or medal jeetne vaali pehali chini cricket team banane ke kareeb pahunch gai thi
 The team reached the semi-finals but lost to Sri Lanka in the bronze medal match
 china kii yuva team ko koching dene vaale purv bangladeshi cricketer manjoorul islam kehete hai, “hamaari sabase badi mushkil ghaas ke maidaanon par sikhaane kii suvidha na hona he
 According to him, the thing that is most noticeable is the passion of the team
 cricket se pyaar kii khatirchini mahila cricket kii kahani ko sabase joardaar tareeke se agar koi bataata he to ve hai uski 29 varshiya captain huang jhu
 Huang, a resident of Changchun in the northeast, started playing cricket when she was studying at Shenyang Sports University
 yah un thode-se skulon main se tha jahaan sabase pehle cricket kii shuruyaat kii gai thi
 Huang says, "I didn't know what cricket is
 main wollyboul khelaa karti thi
 But when i first attended a training session, it was a different experience - swinging the bat, learning to raise my elbow to play the shot
 
 
 sachmuch badi chunauti kii tarah lagata tha
 i fell in love with cricket at the same time and since then i have been playing cricket continuously
 ”esasau ko huang main cricket kii is kadar pratibha najar ai ki usne unhen chaatr ke rup main banaae rakhane ke liye koi kasar nahin chodi
 He was admitted for the post graduate sports course
 huang bhi is vishwaas kii kasuti par khari utrin or team ko do asian final maichon main pahunchaakar hi maanin
 He made a special place in the hearts of many spectators during the England tour, especially when he scored 145 not out against Jersey with a six and 13 checks
 huang or unki team kii khiladinnon ne ittefacan cricket ko apanaaya tha, lekin phir unhone apni jindagi ek aise khel ko samarpit kar di jiske bare main unke desh ke kam hi logon ne suna tha
 His teammate, 22-year-old wicketkeeper Liu Xiaonan, says, "none of my family and friends had heard of cricket
 main sabase zyada khush tab hoti hum jab cricket khel rahi hoti hum
 This is Gentleman Sport
 mujhe timwork or jis tarah ham ek-duusare kii madad karte hai vah acha lagata he
 "liu says that he got friends through cricket
 huang or liu ko china kii uniwarsity life ke dabaavon se nijaat paane kii jagah bhi is khel main mili
 Like Huang, Liu will graduate in the next year and then it will be difficult for him to choose whether to find a job or continue his game
 kariyar ke taur par cricket kaa vikalp nahin chunaa ja saktaa
 Even playing for the country, the cricketers get only 600 yuan (rs 6,000) a month
 ) hi milte hai
 Huang says that it was not easy to persuade her parents that she was going to dedicate her academic life to a sport she had never even heard of
 jab china ne 2010 ke asian khelon kii mejabani kii or pehali baar china kii dharti par antarrashtriya khel ke taur par cricket khelaa gaya, to unka hriday parivartan ho gaya
 She says, "my family came to encourage me at the Asian Games in Guangzhou
 unke liye apni beti ko desh ke liye khelte dekhnaa khaas tha
 Talking about his plans after post graduation, Huang says, "I have to start some work
" main chaahati to jarur hum ki aage bhi khelnaa jari rakhun lekin kya mujhe koi aisa kaam mil saktaa he jiske saath meraa khelnaa bhi jari rahe? kah paanaa mushkil he
 "so do they regret choosing cricket now? She says, "it has been difficult for me to get my life and cricket together
 maine is khel se itnaa kuch siikhaa he, isliye mujhe koi pachhtaawaa nahin he
 i will never forget the feeling of playing for the country
 guangaju main jis pal main apane haath main balla liye khilne ai or meraa parivaar garv se mujhe dekh rahaa tha—vah jindagi kaa gauravshaalee kshan tha

 com / rgimzr34te — ICC (@ICC) July 16, 2019 Stokes, born in New Zealand, moved to England with his family at the age of just 12
 newjiland ke liye rugby lig khel chuke unke pita gerard tab england main koching de rahe the
 Stokes has been living in England since then, though his parents Gerrard and Deb returned to Christchurch
 newjilander of da year aword ke chif jaj camran banet ne kaha, 'stokes bhale hi blike caps ke liye nahin khel rahe hon, lekin vah christchurch main paidaa hue hai, jahaan ab unke mata-pita rahete hai
 Cameron said that the way Williamson kept himself in the midst of the final and devastating disappointment throughout the World Cup resonated with the Kiwis
 ullekhneey he ki newjiland main janme stokes ko kiwi team ke captain ken williamson, newstok jedbi host simon barnet, purv lig star manu vetuvei or christchurch masjid par hue hamalon ke baad hero banakar ubhare abdul ajij ke saath is aword ke liye namit kiya gaya he
 Earlier in England, Prime Ministerial candidates Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt had said that Stokes could get a knighthood (title of head) for a brilliant performance
 haa, maine aam aadmi party se meri neeli wagon-aar, ek motorcycle or kai anya chizein waapas maangi hai, jo maine or meri patni shraddha ne ab tak party ko daan kii hai
 Actually, i don't want any of these back, but i have made the wagon-r a weapon to express my disappointment, because Arvind Kejriwal is not listening, and today he himself is only teaching the language of ego to teach others not to ego
 Is speaking mujhe arvind kejariwal par vishwaas tha
 Today i do not trust him
 ab main sochataa hum ki vah jo bol rahe hai vah sach he yaa nahin
 i did not come to AAP to form an alternative government in Delhi
 main aayaa tha vaikalpik raajnneeti ke liye, saaf raajnneeti ke liye
 
 
 i have decided not to distance myself from AAP due to the incident of the last few days
 jab maine haal ke dilli chunaav main ek daagi ummidavaar ko tikat dene ke khilaaf awaz uthaai, koi karrwai nahin kii gai
 i tried several times to meet Arvind Kejriwal, so that i could keep my point
 maine i-mail kiye
 i wrote them
 maine unhen phone karne kii koshish kii, lekin kisi bhi jariye se kamyaabi nahin mili
 So i raised this issue in the public domain
 ab log twitor par mujhe or meri patni ko gaaliyaan de rahe hai, dhamka rahe hai
 i am being called an agent of Awam (aam Aadmi Volunteer Action Platform)
 mujh par publicity batorne kaa laalchee hone kaa aarope lagaaya ja rahaa he
 i never wanted a ticket from AAP or Kejriwal
 main software kaa se judaa aadmi hum
 i never wanted to make a career in politics
 main hill gaya hum
 The big dream of clean politics, which brought thousands together, is shattered today
 main apane pita se nazaren nahin mila paa rahaa hum, jinhone apni pension kaa ek-tihaai aam aadmi party ko daan kiya tha
 If AAP also returns my car, my motorcycle and my money, then i will donate them to an NGO
 maine 1 janvari, 2013 ko arvind kejariwal se baat kii or unhen wagon-aar dene kii peshkash kii thi
 i did this because it was such a thing that the common man could see himself folded, and this would have given Kejriwal the image of the common man as Chief Minister
 unhon mujhase kaha ki unhen ek 'daan praaanpatr' jari karnaa hoga, or car kaa moolyankan karwaanaa hoga
 i said, there is no need to do any of them, and get that car transferred to the Aam Aadmi Party
 is prakriya main aath maheene lag gaye
 Now i have two special questions with AAP leadership
 
 
 main yah nahin kah saktaa ki prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav sahi the yaa nahin
 i can't judge it
 lekin unhone sahi sawaal puche the, or unhen baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya
 i was also very upset to learn that some mlas harassed Shanti Bhushan, and tried to get him out of a meeting
 mujhe arvind kejariwal se yah kahana he - yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ke khilaaf saarvajanik rup se karrwai kiijie, lekin tabhi kiijie, jab aapke paas un par lagaae gaye aaropon ke saboot hon
 Don't throw someone out just because they don't agree with you
 aap har baar, har samay sahi nahin ho sakate, koi bhi nahin ho saktaa
 Many asked me, if Yogendra Yadav or Prashant Bhushan form a party, will i support them
 meraa jawaab he, main nahin duungaa
 This answer has nothing to do with both of them, but as i said earlier, i did not come here to form an alternative government in Delhi, i had come for alternative politics
 
 
 
 And my dream is broken
 sabhi raajnneetijna ek jaise hi hote hai, koi antar nahin
 i have completely lost faith in politics
 kya insaan itnaa neeche bhi gir saktaa he? kya insaan kii phiratt itani sharmnaak bhi ho sakati he? or kya insaan, sirf apni ochhi chaahaton ke liye apane hi jaise kisi laachaar insaan ke munh se niwala chin saktaa he
 This question is because after the most severe floods of the century in Kashmir, after the appearance of some humans here, it is really ashamed to call such human beings, but what to do? After nature, Kashmir is now in the claws of such human beings
 darasal, jammu-kashmir main baadh kaa pani jaise-jaise kam ho rahaa he, bhukhmaree, mahamari or rozi-rojgaar jaisi tamaam pareshaaniyaan munh baae khadi ho rahi hai
 To bring the life car back on track, humans are struggling to regain basic necessities like livelihood, roads and houses, but in the midst of these natural troubles, how far has man himself become an enemy of man It seems strange too
 magar, kya karen? yahi sach he or sach ye bhi he ki is mushkil haalat main kaise kuch insaan apane andar ke insaan ko maar kar khud apane hi haathon se apane hi insaanon ko luutane se baj nahin aa rahaa he
 a person surrounded by the flood waters proved to be the biggest enemy for those who came on the boat, who were considered as angels
 rahtakarmiyon ke bich unheen kaa labaadaa odh kar kuch log aise bhi the, jinhone inhen gharon se nikaala to jarur, lekin ghar khaali karwaane ke baad khud unheen logon ne gharon main chori kii or is baat kaa ahsaas unhen tab hua, jab wo pani kam hone ke baad apane gharon main waapas laute
 In the aftermath of 55 years of floods in Jammu, which have ruined the paradise of the earth, now on the way, the people of Jammu and Kashmir are giving that wound, which is also difficult to think about
 haalat ye he ki sena or duusari agenciyon ne jin 2 lakh 34 hazaar se zyaada logon ko unke thikaanon se nikaal kar mahafooz jagahon tak pahunchaaya he, ab khud vahi log apane gharon main lautne se ghabara rahe hai
 One is that the flood waters have shaken the foundation of their houses, the incidents of theft and plunder from above have left nothing but a few bricks in the houses
 sawaal ye he ki akhir is musiibat kii ghadi main ve koun log hai, jo pehle haalat se laachaar insaan ko bhi luutane se baj nahin aa rahe? kya ye sachmuch insaan hai yaa phir insaan kii shakl main kuch or? This was India's first match in the World Cup
 australia ke lambey daure main team jeet se vanchit rahi
 In such a situation, being in the first match of Pakistan was a matter of great pressure, but Dhoni expressed why he is called Captain Cool
 adilade ke maidan membharatane pakistan ko 76 ranon se haraakar world cap main chhathi baar jeet hasil kii
 Dhoni, without showing any kind of emotion as usual, put the match in his bag and raised the expectations of the team
 viraat kohli, raina or form se jujh rahe shikhar dhawan ne jabardast pari kheli
 a score of 300 always puts psychological pressure on the opposition in ODI cricket and this time too it happened
 pakistan kii team is vishaal score kaa peechha nahin kar pai
 Our bowlers, especially Shami, made great balls
 spinner aswin ko ek hi wicket mila, lekin teen madan over phenk kar unhone apane jhande gaad die
 Their economical bowling failed to give Pakistan a big score
 team kii fielding, batting or bowling aalaa darje kii rahi
 Each player performed his responsibility well
 lekin ek sawaal jiskaa jawaab koi bhi nahin de paa rahaa he, vah he ki pakistan world cap main bharat se kyon haar jaataa he? ravivaar ko tivi channelon main baithe pakistani visheshgy or purv khilaadi bhi is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin de paae
 He analyzed the match but could not tell what happens in the World Cup that Pakistan's team loses
 1992 main world cap kaa khitaab jeetne vaali pakistani team sidney main bharat se haar gai thi
 Passing a small score of 216 became heavy for him
 uske baad se yah silsilaa shuru hua or ab tak jari he
 Each time the characters change but the result remains the same
 majboot dikh rahi pakistani team haar jaati he
 Every time a different reason is given but no one can explain the reason why this happens again and again
 yah bhi gaur karne laayak baat he ki vanade cricket main pakistan ne bharat ko kahin zyada baar haraaya he
 Every time the Pakistani captain's answer is, don't know what happened and we lost
 ve taatkaalik kaaran to bataa dete hai lekin pakki vazah nahin bataa pate hai
 Really, who will be able to tell the secret of this thing? In such a situation, it seems right about fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, Allah will be able to tell why Pakistan loses every time

 lekin yah bhi sach he ki agar viraat ne yah 'super dabl dhamaakaa' kiya, to uske peeche rahi dhoni kii chot

 This time it started against the Eden Gardens against Sri Lanka and in the third Test of the series released at Ferozeshah Kotla, Kohli scored a century and converted the super bang made three years ago into a double super bang
 yah vah karnama he, jo test cricket itihaas main viraat ke alaava pehle koi doosraa captain nahin hi kar sakaa he
 Prior to Kotla, Virat had scored 104 * at Eden Gardens and 213 at Kolkata and now with Kotla's century innings, Virat Kohli became the only captain in the world to score a century in three consecutive innings twice
 The run machine continues

 com / sevr4oluid desh kii rajdhani dilli main nursery daakhila aasaan nahin he, daakhile kii prakriya ko mushkil banaaya he har saal badalte daakhile ke niyamon ne
 The government blames the schools for the parental problem, while the schools argue that both the school and the parents are upset because of the ever-changing rules
 nursery admician main privet skool tay karen crityria: hoicourtrajadhani ke kisi bhi skool ke baahar chale jaaie
 
 
 The picture will be approximately the same
 kahin point system kii maathapai, to kahin dastavejon kii uljhan, kahin apper age par kanfusion to kahin online-ofline kii abisidi or in sabake bich wo nanhe-munne jo skool main apana pehla kadam rakhana chaahate hai
 
 
 But when the nursery admission process is so complicated in the capital of the country, the parent has no other option but to go round the schools
 nursery admician: ab 31 janvari tak bhar sakenge forkeb sawaal uthta he ki abhibhavakon kii is mushkil kaa jimmedaar koun? kya nursery daakhile kii uljhi hui prakriya ke liye skulon ko jimmedaar tehraaya jaae yaa phir sarkaar jo baar-baar daakhile ke liye nae niyam lagu karti he or maamla court pahunch jaataa he
 This year also the matter is in court
 lekin ye pehali baar nahin he jo badalte niyamon kii vajah se daakhile kaa pench atka he
 Let us tell you that when and how the rules of nursery admission sometimes changed the policies of the government and sometimes after the orders of the court
 
 
 oxford uniwarsity main daakhile se bhi mushkil he dilli ke nursery skulon main daakhila?- saal 2004 ke pehle tak skulon ke paas adhikaar tha ki daakhile ke liye bachche or uske mata-pita kaa saakshaatkaar kar sakate the
 20 per cent of the seats in schools built on government land were reserved for the children of EWS quota
 - saal 2004 main rakesh agarwal naam ke abhibhavak ne daakhile kii prakriya ko adaalat main chunauti di
 In 2007, the High Court created the Ashok Ganguly Committee, ending the screening and interview in admissions
 ganguli kamity ne nebarhud, sibling, parents ajukeshan jaise criteria ke aadhaar par 100 point formula banaaya
 - In 2007, the Action Committee for Unaided Recognized Private School challenged the recommendations of the Ganguly Committee in the Supreme Court
 - saal 2008 main thode badlaav ke saath ganguli kamity kii siforishein nursery daakhile main lagu kar di gayi, jisamen skulon ko criteria nirdhaarit karne kii chhot thi
 - From 2008 to 2010, according to the recommendations of the Ganguly Committee, schools were admitted
 - saal 2010 main 'rhite tu ajukeshan act' lagu hua or EWS kota 20 fisadi se badhkar 25 fisadi ho gaya
 In 2010, the schools again issued guidelines for nursery admission based on the recommendations of the Ganguly Committee, but the Social Jurist institution challenged the schools' point and criterion system to implement the 'right to Education Act' in court
 
 - maamla court main lambit rahaa or skulon ne saal 2010 se 2013 tak ek baar phir ganguli kamity kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par daakhile kiye, jisamen management kota, staff kota shaamil tha
 - In February 2013, Delhi High Court excluded the nursery admissions from the 'right to Education Act', saying that nursery admission is for children below 6 years of age
 - disambar 2013 main raashtrapati shashan ke dauraan alji ne 70 point nebarhud formule ke saath guideline jari kiya or nursery daakhile se management kota samaapt kar diya
 - lg's notifications were again challenged by private schools in the court and the admissions process was pulled till March 2014
 - navambar 2014 main dilli hai court ne alji dwaara jari kii gai guideline ko khaarij karte hue ek baar phir ashok ganguli kamity kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par daakhila karne kii manjuuri di
 Although the government approached the Supreme Court against the High Court's decision, by then nursery admissions in schools had been made on the basis of the criterion issued by the schools
 - navambar 2015 main aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne dilli skool ajukeshan bill paas kiya lekin kendra kii manjuuri nahin mili
 In 2015, the government issued guidelines for abolishing the management quota, against which schools moved the High Court
 faisla skulon ke paksh main aayaa
 In addition, in November 2015, the government started the process of centralized online application for EWS quota
 disambar 2016 main dilli sarkaar ne nijee jameen par bane 1400 skulon ke liye alag guideline jari kii or janvari 2017 main sarkari jameen par bane 298 skulon ke liye 0-1 kimi ke daayre main nebarhud ko anirvaay daakhila dene vaali guideline jari karte hue management kota, staff kota, elumani jaise criteria khatm kar die
 After which the matter is once again in court
 gauratlab he ki dilli hoicourt ne sunwaayee ke dauraan dilli sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaate hue kaha he ki sarkaar daakhile kii guideline navambar-disambar main hi kyon jari karti he, isse abhibhavakon kaa kanfusion badhata he
 Nursery Admission: Management ended in 298 private schools in Delhi
 It is for the first time that two different guidelines were issued for private schools in the capital
 sarkaar ke mutabik nae disha-nirdeshon se daakhile main paardarshita aegi
 But if the schools are to be believed then the government is increasing instead of solving the problem of parents
 jaankaron kii maane to daakhile ke is dangal se bachane ke liye sarkaar, skool association, abhibhavak sangh sabhi ko mil-baithkar ek kaaman admician process bananaa chahie jo saal yaa sarkaar badalane ke saath naa badale
 This year, the Mission Admission has been entangled in legal strings, but it is expected that the guidelines for nursery admission in the new session will ease the way for the parents

 seemaa suraksha bal ne somvaar kii subah gurdaspur se 40 kilometre dur dharm kot pattan naamak jagah se ek sandigdh pakistani naav baraamad kii he
 Which was reported to the authorities by a local seafarer
 ab naav kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 The suspected boat is found from Dera Baba Nanak sector of Gurdaspur
 jo raavi nadi se bahakar bharat pahunchi he
 The boat was first seen by a local boatman, Tarsem Christ
 tarsem subah 7 baje logon ko raavi nadi paar karwaane ke liye pahunche the
 As soon as he crossed the boat, he immediately informed the BSF officials
 soochna milane ke kuch der baad hi BSF adhikariyon ne dharamkot pattan pahunchakar naav ko apane kabje main le liya
 The boat is found just before the anniversary of the Pathankot terrorist attack
 isliye BSF adhikari isaki baariki se jaanch kar rahe hai
 This boat is sky blue
 is par likhaa he ki yah naav manz agro farms, kasar, narowal se taalluk rakhti he
 Whose manager is Mohammad Sajid
 naav par isaki baqayada pahchaan sankhya 03431 237 545 ankit he
 Apart from this, 042 36 666 195 is also written
 naav par pakistan ke rashtriya chinh ke alaava urdu main bhi kuch likhaa gaya he
 According to BSF sources, the Ravi river has been flooded due to rain in the past
 jis kaaran yah naav pakistan ke narowal se bahakar gurdaspur pahunch gai lagati he
 The local Marana Port Bridge has also been washed away due to flooding in the river
 darasal, raavi nadi pakistan ke kuch hisson se bahati hui punjab pahunchati he
 It is therefore feared that this boat may have brought the river with it
 yah pehali baar nahin he, jab pakistan kii koi naav bharat pahunchi he
 Last year also two such installments were recovered in Punjab
 parantu pichley saal baraamad kii gai naav main sirf itnaa sa fark he ki is naav par maalik kaa pataa or sampark likhaa gaya he
 BSF is investigating the boat with its possession
