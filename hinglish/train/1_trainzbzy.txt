 bada score naa tobharat ke paas banane ke liye tha or naa hi yuai ke pasbachane ke liye
 Still, Shikhar Dhawan, the hero of the first two matches, and Rohit Sharma, who failed in the first two matches, made a decent start
 donon ne milakar saatven over tak 29 ran jod bhi liye lekin isi score par mohammad navid kii gend ko panch karne kii koshish main shikhar gend ko neeche nahin rakh paae
 Rohan Mustafa, standing at the backward point, took an amazing catch with one hand, which ended Dhawan's 14-run innings
 pehle do maichon main ran naa bana paane kii tis rohit sharma ko behatar khilne kii prerana de rahi thi
 He knew that the score in front was not very big, so his attempt was to take the ball in the middle of the bat
 pari ke nauven over main mohammad navid kii gendon par teen chauke jadkar rohit ne khud par se dabaav bhi hataa liya
 Virat standing at the other end was also encouraging Rohit
 donon ne milakar 10wein over main bharat ko 50 ke paar pahunchaa diya
 The pace of runs was increasing and the distance from Jeet was getting reduced
 16 over tak bharat ne 1 wicket par 88 ran ban liye the
 Rohit Sharma was just 3 runs away from his half-century and Virat was playing at 27
 jeet se faasla sirf 15 ran kaa tha lekin dinar brake ke chalate bharat kaa intazaar thodaa lanbaa ho gaya
 Rohit, after returning from dinner, completed his half century by hitting a four in the 17th over
 18wein over main bharat ke 100 ran bhi puure ho gaye or 19wein over kii aakhri gend par chaukaa jamaakar rohit ne bharat ko is worldcup main lagaataar teesri jeet dilaa di
 Rohit remained unbeaten scoring 57 and Virat 33
 9 wicket se mili is shandaar jeet kii badaulatatim indiyaapane pool main ab bhi top pojishan par bani hui he
 This was the first encounter between India and UAE in the World Cup
 match se pehle team india ne yuai kii khubiyaan talashne main jitani mehnat kii yuai ne utani hi mehnat bharat kii khaamiyon ko khangaalane main kii
 The uae's decision to bat first on an irregularly bouncy Perth wicket after winning the toss gave his team a sigh of relief as it was difficult to gauge how much India's strong batting could score here
 yuai ke is faislese bharat ko bhi thodaa chaiyn mila kyonki worldcup se pehle kheli gai tri siries ke ek mukaable main isi maidan par england ke gendbaajon ne pehle ballebaaji karne vaali bhartiya team ke majboot batting line-ap ko dho kar rakh diya tha or puri team ko 200 par samet diya tha
 The UAE team landed on the ground without any changes but Team India was without its star bowler Mohammed Shami, who was suffering from knee pain
 aise main bhubaneshwar kumaar kii vaapasi ke liye ye ek behtareen plateform tha
 The duo of Amjad Ali and Andrey Berringer started to open the innings for the UAE but the two could not spend much time together on the pitch
 pari ke duusare hi over main umesh yadav kii ek bounsar ko hook karne kii koshish main beringer ne ball ko apane sir par hi khadaa kar diya, jise dhoni ne aasaani se lapak kar beringer kii 4 ranon kii pari kaa ant kar diya
 Second opener Amjad Ali also could not progress beyond 4 runs
 chot se vaapasi kar rahe bhubaneshwar kumaar kii upar uthati gend ko hook karne main wo naakaam hue or gend unke globs se chooti hui dhoni ke paas ja pahunchi
 After losing 2 wickets for just 13 runs in 5 overs, UAE now needed a partnership that could lead the team to a solid score
 ab pich par the bhartiya mul ke krishna chandran karate or bharat ke khilaaf van-de match khilne kaa anubhav rakhane vaale khurram khan
 But both had just added 15 runs in 5 overs that Krishna Chandran missed out on a slow ball from Ashwin
 koshish to unki gend ko dephence karne kii thi lekin gend unke glbus or thai pad ko chooti hui leg slip main khadey raina ke haathon main samaa gai
 Karate also scored 4 runs
 bhartiya mul ke ek or ballebaaj swapnil patil bhi aswin kii phiraki main funs gaye
 In the 15th over of the innings, in an attempt to forward Ashwin's ball to the defense, the ball took the edge of his bat and reached Shikhar Dhawan standing in the slip
 dhawan ne shandaar dive lagaate hue is kaich ko pakadaa
 Only 7 runs came off Patil's bat
 anbhavi khurram khan kaa anubhav bhi aswin ke aage ghutane tech gaya
 In order to sweep the rising ball, the ball collided with his bat and bounced off the top of Dhoni's head towards the leg slip, which Raina ran and caught it in his hands
 out hone se pehle khurram ne 14 ran banaae
 This was Ashwin's third consecutive wicket
 17wein over main 44 ran tak pahunchate-pahunchate yuai ne apni aadhi team ganvaa di
 Every bowler of the Indian team was taking wickets
 isi bahati ganga main mohit sharma or ravindra jadeja ne bhi haath dho liye
 Rohan Mustafa missed Mohit's ball and got lbw in trying to defend the ball
 rohan ne ampire ke is faisle ke khilaaf rivyuu bhi liya lekin koi phayda nahin hua
 Rohan scored 2 runs
 amjad javed bhi do ran banaakar jadeja kii gend ko dephence karte hue slip main khadey raina ko kaich thama baithe
 All the hopes of the uae's big score were destroyed
 puchhlle ballebaajon ke saath shaiman anwar khadey to the lekin ek chor se girte viketon ke bich unke haath main bhi zyada kuch nahin tha
 Mohammad Naveed (6), who came in at number eight, was bowled by Ashwin and Jadeja was bowled by captain Mohammad Tauqeer (1) at number nine
 pari ke aadhe over bich chuke the or yuai 100 kaa aankada chune ke liye sangharsh kar rahi thi
 Well for 7 overs Shaiman Anwar and Manjula Gurus kept their wickets and somehow took their team to 100 in the 32nd over
 lekin isi over main umesh yadav ne 35 ran bana chuke shaiman anwar ko bold kar diya
 With this, the entire UAE team was reduced to 102 runs
 bharat ke khilaaf worldcup main kisi bhi team kaa ye sabase kam score he

 com / 7pkuks3b2m BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra has questioned the wealth of Rahul Gandhi and the Gandhi family
 ravivaar ko press conference karke unhone poocha ki jab gandhi parivaar gandhi parivaar koi kaam nahin karata to unki itani sampatti kaise he? 2004 se 2014 tak rahul gandhi kii sampatti 55 lakh se badhkar 9 karod kaise ho gai? paatra ne kaha ki samaj main yah nahin aata ki is parivaar kii sampatti itani zyada kaise ho gai? jabaki, is parivaar kii kamai kaa ekmaatr saadhan saansadi he
 He has no job like a doctor or a lawyer
 sambit paatra ne gandhi parivaar ke jameen saude, form house ke kiraye or sampatti saude par sawaal uthaae hai
 Sambit has also challenged filing a defamation case
 sambit paatra ne rahul ke mahrauli sthit farmahouse ko lekar daawa kiya he ki yah lagbhag 5 acre kaa he
 Its owners are Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi
 ise 2013 main financial technology india limited naam kii company ko kiraye par diya tha
 It comes with a rent of 7 lakh rupees every month
 iske liye pehali baar 40 lakh rupye advance main liye gaye
 This amount was completely interest free
 jabaki, sawaal yah uthta he ki bina byaaj ke koi paison ko advance main kaise de saktaa he
 The National Spot Exchange Limited, a subsidiary of the company to which it has been hired, scammed the NLEL in 2013
 is formahouse se 2007-08 se 2012-13 ke bich 3 karod rupye kii kamai hui
 Whereas, in his affidavit, Rahul has stated the value of this farmhouse at 9 lakh rupees but has earned crores of rupees from it
 rahul gandhi ne ellection afidavit main mahrauli main 'indira farm house' kii keemat 9 lakh likhi he lekin usase aap karodon kiraaya lete ho : shri@sambitswarajpic
 twitter
 com / e1tbujnrrt— BJP (@bjp4india)march 24, 2019sambit paatra ne bataaya ki gurugram main bhi aktubar 2010 main rahul ne do vyavsaayik sampattiyon ko kharida tha
 Total price of both 6
 80 karod rupye thi
 Both properties were purchased at Unitech Signature Towers-2
 donon kii kul keemat saat karod rupye he lekin iske anubandh ke liye keval chaar karod rupye die gaye
 Interest was also charged on these four crore rupees from 2010-11 to 2014-15
 unhone poocha ki yah rakam byaaj kamaane ke liye di gai thi yaa sampatti kharidne ke liye
 BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said in a press conference on Sunday that the work of black money has been done
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi, priyanka gandhi or robert wadra ne sandigdh land deal kii he
 Wherever Rahul Gandhi nominates, we will keep an eye on him
 main gandhi parivaar se poochna chahta hum ki aakhir bina kamaaye gandhi parivaar ne kahaan se bana lee karodon kii itani sampatti? Vadodara, the country's 10th cleanest city, has set a new Guinness world record on Monday
 yah record ek hi jagah sabase zyada logon ne jhaadu lagaakar banaaya he
 Vadodara Municipal Corporation Commissioner Vinod Rao said that about 5,058 people had come to sweep the bridge connecting Akota with Dandiya Bazar
 yah pul ek kilometre lanbaa he
 The decider of the Guinness World Record Competition conferred the World Record certificate just after the event

 punjab sarkaar purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh par aadhaarit film 'da accidental prime ministar' kii relies ko punjab main rokane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 In fact, many cabinet ministers of the Punjab government do not want this film to be released in Punjab
 in mantriyon kaa kahana he ki is film main congress party or unke netaa purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii chhavi ko galat tareeke se dikhaaya gaya he or ye sab congress ko raajnneetik nuksaan pahunchane ke liye kiya gaya he
 Punjab government minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot said that directly the film has tried to describe the country's first Sikh Prime Minister and senior Congress leader Manmohan Singh as a weak prime minister
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhi dekhnaa chahie ki ek aisa arthshaastri jiskaa loha puraa vishwa maanata ho or jisane 10 saal tak desh par raaj karke badhiya tareeke se sarkaar chalaai ho, uskaa majaak banaate hue is tarah kii film ko relies nahin hone dena chahie
 The central government should put a stop to this film and the sentiments of Sikhs can also be hurt due to this film
 wo koshish karenge ki punjab sarkaar is film ko punjab main relies na hone de
 At the same time, Akali Dal spokesperson Charanjit Singh Brar said that the state government of Congress in Punjab did not want to allow the film 'the Accidental Prime Minister' to be released because this film directly shows how under pressure from Gandhi family Manmohan Singh took many decisions under compulsion
 gandhi parivaar ne unhen desh kaa pradhanmantri to bana diya lekin hameshaa se hi unhen dabaav main rakhaa gaya
 The Punjab government is preparing to put a stop to this film due to the fact that it did not come out in public

 If someone has criticized it does not mean that he is a Deshadrahi Aamir Khan is a very big star of the country and people took his point very wrongly
 aamir ke mudde par logon ne jitna ganda bolaa, vah sahi nahin he
 i do not compete with anyone like Kareena Kapoor said that i am my favorite, similarly i am my competitor

 This task is not so easy, but we are constantly trying
 agar mughalsarai-elahabaad ke bich train let ho rahi he to vah kal se nahin ho rahi, saalon se ho rahi he isliye ise sudhaarney main bhi vakt lagegaa

 RPN Singh said that what is the condition of farmers under NDA rule, everyone knows
 is par hossain bole ki jab tak aap sansad nahin chalane denge, ham kisaanon or garibon ke liye kaise kaam karenge
 RPN Singh also discussed the National Herald, without naming Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, told Hussain that someone's ideology is different from you and if you try to stop it then it is wrong
 congress un awaajon ko band nahin hone degi
 The BJP could not do anything in the Bofars case
 anjaan ne kaha ki neshnal herald kaise khadaa hua, is par congress ko shwet patr laana chahie, taaki puraa desh hakeekat jaan paae
 The debate on the GST bill also lashed out at the BJP leader over the GST bill
 unhone kaha ki ye log desh ko jiesti ke bade taane dete hai or kehete hai ki wo desh ko badalanaa chaahate hai
 But these people did not allow GST to be implemented for three years
 anjaan ne kaha ki jiesti par bahut baaten ho rahi hai
 But when the GST came through the Congress government, then Arun Jaitley strongly opposed that bill
 arun jetali aaj sansad main khadey hokar yah kah den ki hamane bhi sansad main iskaa virodh kiya tha
 After Hussain RPN Singh's attacks on the Congress, Shahnawaz Hussain retaliated and said that more people left gas subsidies than the Congress did not get votes

 If there are so many companies in the market, then surely it is natural to increase customer expectations
 number portability se upabhoktaaon ko jarur suvidha mili he, lekin jitani bhi telecom companiyaan hai, unhen zyada fark nahin padaa he
 Many consumers were getting angry with BSNL, but ever since we have launched schemes like Roaming Free across the country, a large number of customers are joining us
 aisi skim dene vaale ham desh ke akele telecom oparator he
 This also reduces the company's revenue
 hamen yah skim launch karne se pehle hi pataa tha ki ek saal main hamen 150 se 200 karod rupee kaa nuksaan hoga
 But after the roaming free scheme, more than double the number of consumers started joining us and this also compensated for our loss of 150 crores

 However, Jatin Prasad said that there should be games too
 lekin sawaal uthaaya ki sushamaa swaraj ke islamabad jane se desh ko kya mila
 Jitendra said that this is pre-preparation
 palatwaar main jatin ne kaha ki piem modi or pakistan ke piem mil liye, photo khinchvaa lee, kya ye purv taiyaari he
 Jitendra Singh said that the official meeting has a different meaning

Sinha said on this - When the process of investigation starts, FIR is registered then we try to search immediately
 shaadi ke bare main aam logon ko bhi nahin maaloom tha to sibiai ko kaise maaloom hota
 We do not spy jasusi kii hoti to shaadi kaa bhi pataa chalata
 Significantly, the CBI raided the house of Veerbhadra on the day of his daughter's wedding on 26 September on the charge of unaccounted assets

 ) After a humiliating defeat in the last two Tests, the Indian cricket team, which has been struggling with poor form, will look to regain the lost reputation by equalizing the series through the fifth and final Test against England starting on Friday
 lords par aitihaasik jeet ke baad bharat ko southampton or manchester main sharmnaak paraajay jhelni padi
 Now the challenge facing the backward Indian team 1-2 in the series is to avoid defeat
 bharat ke ballebaaj lagaataar naakaam rahe hai or gendbaaji main bhi dhar nahin dikhi, jisase england ko vaapasi kaa mauka mil gaya
 The good news for India is that fast bowler Ishant Sharma has been fit for the last Test
 team prabandhan ke saamne chayan kii duvidha yah he ki kharaab form se jujh rahe ravindra jadeja ko chune yaa bench strength ko aajamaae
 In the last two Tests, the Indian batsmen were quite disappointed
 viraat kohli or cheteshwar pujaara apni pratibha ke saath nyaay nahin kar sake hai
 Test specialist Pujara has this last chance and Kohli will also have to recover from poor form
 team main vaapasi karne vaale gautam gambhir bhi dabaav main hai or unhen apni upyogita sabit kerani hogi
 The bowling has been strengthened by the return of Ishant, who was the source of the victory over Lord's
 vah team main pankaj singh kii jagah lenge, chunki varun aron apane pradarshan se prabhavit karne main safal rahe hai
 Jadeja's playing seems doubtful due to poor performances in Manchester
 paanchaven gendbaaj ke rup main vah bhale hi upyogi hon, lekin ballebaaji main vah stuart binni jaise khilaadiyon se unniis sabit hue hai
 There are indications that India can get down to five bowlers without making much changes
 lords par 95 ran se jeet darj karne ke baad sab kuch bharat ke anukool lag rahaa tha, lekin uske baad england ne shandaar vaapasi karte hue southampton main 11 test baad pehali jeet darj kii
 Then beat India in Manchester within three days
 chauthe test main mili haar ke baad aisa mana ja rahaa tha ki bhartiya team ko aaraam kii jarurat he, taaki tarotaaja hokar aakhri match khel sake
 However, the reason for the defeat was not fatigue, but a lack of willpower to stay at the crease in adverse conditions
 khilaadiyon main patibaddhta kii kami dikhi
 When captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni takes off for the toss on Friday, he will also be equating Sourav Ganguly's record of captaincy in 28 Tests abroad
 ganguli ne unamem se 11 test jite, 10 haare or baaki drow rahe
 Dhoni won six, drew eight and lost 13

 If we look at Gandhi's life and contradictions, it can be said that his personality and philosophy was a continuous entity
 ek nirmaanadhin imaarat jisamen har kshan kaam chalata tha
 His life was a laboratory, a mind as well
 ek avadharana ke rup main gandhi usee tarah ek sutara ke rup main hamen milte hai jis tarah marks; yah hamaare upar he ki ham apane vartmaan or bhavishya ko us sutara se kaise samajhen
 This is the reason why they persist despite being shot, intermittently proving them irrelevant, and how many historical mistakes are attributed; And will live
 unki hatya karanevaali takaton ke varchasv ke baad bhi ve honge
 They are not complete scriptures, they are a way of life, which always demands to be continued
 aaj giriraaj kishor ke janmdin par sahitya ajtak par unki raajakmal prakaashan se haalia prakashit pustak 'gandhi or samaaj' kaa ansh prastut kar rahe
 All the articles included in this book have been written on different occasions over the years; Therefore their references are extremely contemporary; And let's look at Gandhi from today
 in aalekhon main ‘vyakti gandhi’ or ‘vichaar gandhi’ ke viruddh idhar jor pakad rahe sangathit dushprachaar ko bhi rekhaankit kiya gaya he; or unke hatyare ko poojanevaali maansikta kii hinsr sanrachana ko bhi chintaa va chintan kaa vishay banaaya gaya he
 Book excerpt: Gandhi and Samajgandhi also learned from Ambedkar - Giriraj Kishore In the twentieth century, there were two such persons who have deeply influenced Indian society in the field of human rights
 ek mahatma gandhi, duusare bhimrao ambedkar
 Human rights are affected in two directions
 ek, vyakti ke rup main kisi ke dukh ko samajhnaa or uskaa pratikaar, doosraa, saamaajik str par samaaj kii takalif ko samajhnaa or niraakaran karnaa
 This is a huge challenge
 ambedkar kaa maanviya sarokaar duusare prakaar kaa tha
 There was such a large Dalit class in front of them, whose torture they themselves felt
 us varg kii pidaa unki apni thi
 Their pain was of the whole class, which was a very big part of this country
 pidaa kaa niraakaran tabhi sambhav ho saktaa he, jab manushya uskaa saakshaatkaar apane andar kare
 Ambedkar connected his concerns with the society
 unki is karunaa ko buddha ke sandarbh main dekha jaae, tabhi ham anubhav kar sakate hai ki ambedkar ne apane andar kii takalif ko apane tak simit na rakhkar samshti se jod diya tha
 a human becomes a human being only when a sense of compassion fills him
 yahi kaaran tha ki ambedkar dalit mukti ke liye jo sangharsh kar rahe the, usamen manuaadi daastaa ko todgaye, jaateey jakadaaa ko kamjor karne or saamaajik gatishiltaa ko badhaane main buddha-darshan kaa bahut bada haath he
 The biggest thing is that his human rights, not reformist, was a movement for self-emancipation, in which self-emancipation can be realized even to the person who is most oppressed by social discrimination
 dakshin africa main vahaan ke bhartiya girmitiyaa mazdooron ko mukt karne ke liye aisa hi sangharsh gandhi ji ne bhi kiya tha
 Most of the Indian laborers were either Dalits or backward classes
 isiilie unhen apane ko ek tarah se 'diclas’ karnaa padaa tha
 It was imperative for Gandhi to change his way of life, food, food and clothing and get down on equal footing and participate in his struggle
 ambedkar ke liye yah jaruri nahin tha kyonki unki apni jaden usee varg main thim
 Even though he lived in the ultimate modern way
 gandhi ne yah anubhav kiya tha ki ye majdoor unka bahut sammaan karte hai, par unke jivan jeene ke or rahan-sahan ke tareeke se najadik aane main jhijakte hai
 Unless he changes it, it will not be possible to create a sense of equality in him
 yahan tak ki unke makaan main jo majdoor yaa kaaryakarta raat main aakar thaharte the, unke peshaab ke bartan subah vah swayan khaali karte or dhote the
 There was also tension between Kasturba and him about this
 ambedkar ko is samanta kaa pramaan dene kii anivaaryta nahin thi
 His race for Dalit emancipation started far ahead of Gandhi
 ambedkar ne buddha kii samta ko hi apane jivan kaa aadhaar banaaya
 This was a self-evident reaction against the Hindu varna system
 vah unke apane anubhav kaa pratidaan tha
 Gandhi initially considered the caste and varna system, but later in his practice also rejected the system that he would not attend any marriage in which the bride and groom would not have a Dalit
 gandhi ne apane ko ambedkar ke prabhaav main is bindu par puri tarah se badla
 This flexibility is seen in Gandhi more than Ambedkar
 darasal bhale hi varna vyavastha armbh main vyavsaay par aadhaarit rahi ho jaisaa ki kuch vidwaan maanate hai, baad main anuvanshik yani rakt shuddhta kaa paryaay ho gai ho
 Gandhi's neglect of the question of blood purity in that period was to reject the varna system
 kai baar lagata he ki sadiyon se upekshit or vanchit chale aa rahe varg ko mukhyadhara main laane or sammanit sthaan dilaane kaa martin luther king junior kii tarah hi ambedkar kaa bhi ek mahaan praytn tha
 Even though Martin Luther was a follower of King Gandhi, he, like Ambedkar, succeeded in bringing his neglected class to the level of equality
 usee sangharsh kaa nateeja he ki aaj america jaise rangavaadi desh ke raashtrapati blike samudaay ke hai
 Here i will refer to Rahul Sankrityayan's philosophy, his opinion with reference to Buddha, 'buddha was like an agent of the ruling class of his time
 varg ke moulik swaarth ko hataae bina vah apane ko nyaay ke pakshdhar bananaa chaahate the
 'can the same apply to Ambedkar? Despite his belief that the British did nothing for the Dalit except that Dalit was not discriminated against in the eyes of the law (whereas in Manuwadi law, there was a completely different penal law against Dalit)
 ve sarkaar ke sammanit sadsy the
 Ambedkar had deep compassion for the Dalit society
 karunaa hi maanavadhikaar kaa aadhaar he
 But that compassion did not benefit his entire society
 shaayad is kaaran ki savarna samaaj ho yaa avarna samaaj, sadaa se banta rahaa he
 Having four or five characters is a proof that we have never been one
 janmajaat foot ke shikaar hai
 Perhaps this was the reason that despite millions of efforts, Ambedkar could not form a society by mixing the Dalit class among themselves
 keval aarakshan ke naam par ek hai, vaise bante hai
 Like them the upper untouchability remained like the upper castes
 antim dinon main ambedkar kaha karte the ki jo main chahta tha, vah kar nahin paaya
 Perhaps there was a feeling behind it that he could not mix the entire Dalit society
 yah baat gandhi ke sandarbh main bhi sahi lagati he
 Ambedkar faced the challenge of advancing his society
 gandhi ke saamne varchasv vaale samaaj ko peeche laakar upekshit samaaj ke saath samta kaa rishta banane kii chunauti thi, jo or bhi kathin thi
 Bringing them back was an odd challenge
 iske liye unhen athak praytn karnaa padaa
 There was opposition and opposition as well
 lekin gandhi ne unka dresscode sweekaar kiya
 He stayed in their settlements
 ek bahut bade varg ko chuaachhut ke is ghrunit soch se baahar nikaalane main safal bhi hue
 Despite all this, a large part could not come out of its 'mind set'
 vah jati or varnavaad vaale samaaj main gandhi or ambedkar ke prayatnon ke baavjood ab bhi maujuud he

 He is the same sabir who once cursed Modi by drinking water on the basis of Gujarat riots
 party line todakar modi kii tarif karne kii sajaa bhi sabir ali ko mil gai
 JDU spokesman KC Tyagi said that he has been expelled from JDU and his Lok Sabha candidature from Shivhar has also been scrapped
 ab kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki sabir bijepi main shaamil ho sakate hai
 If that happens, it would be a big setback for Nitish Kumar and his party
 party se nikaale jane ke baad sabir bhi bhadak uthe hai
 He said that he has been punished for being a Muslim and it would not have happened if he were the son of Kurmi
 unhone daawa kiya ki nitish kumaar ne unhen rajyasabha bhejne kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin loksabhaa candidet bana diya
 Taking a dig at Casey Tyagi, Sabir said, 'those who are touting Mouna Baba here, will now expel us? Some KC Tyagi is saying that he has expelled me from the party
 ye wo log hai jo municipal chunaav bhi nahin lard sakate
 Very soon Mauna Baba will be on ventilator
 maine kisi kaa naam nahin liya tha
 But the country should be in their hands who can control everything
 'sabir ali ne kaha ki jab unke saath party aisa dhokhaa kar sakati he to bihar kii janata ke saath kya kuch nahin ho saktaa
 If the ticket was given to the right man, he would not have objected, but he was not given a Rajya Sabha ticket because he comes from the Muslim community
 sabir ne yah bhi kaha ki unhone kabhi jediu ko bijepi se alag hone kii salaah nahin di thi or yah puri tarah se nitish kumaar kaa hi faisla tha
 Sabir said that he has never got a chance to see Modi up close, but now he will decide what he needs to do next

 There will be a big protest by the opposition led by the Aam Aadmi Party at Delhi's Jantar Mantar on Wednesday afternoon

 The biggest question is whether the country's largest opposition party, Congress, will join this satyagraha? According to AAP sources, it is expected that the Congress will also be a part of this demonstration
 lekin dekhne vaali baat hogi ki congress se koun netaa or kis str kaa netaa jantar mantar par aata he
 Mamta Banerjee will also attend a government function in the city

 ‘masakali’ girl patrika main kavali ke dizin kiye gaye kapade dhaaran karengi
 Sonam told a news channel that the most different thing about this collection is that there is no print in it

 kisi bahari kii vajah se party main bavaal machaa hua he
 Uncle and nephew are all busy doing their own things
 kisi kaa vibhaag chhina jaataa he, to kisi ko koi nai jimmedaari se nawaja jaataa he
 Some of these decisions are taken by the 'sarkar' runner from his heart, and some by whispering around
 lekin jab bhi is party kii baat aati he to shahenshaah ek hi hota he or uskaa hukum na maanane kii jurrat koi nahin kar saktaa
 And when that 'boss' trump card moves, all of them bow down before him, all rebellions die and all unite and dream the same dream

 The allegation and counter-allegations are in full swing in Delhi's election riots
 aam aadmi party (aap) ke saansad bhagwant maan ne bijepi kii siem pad kii ummidavaar kiran bedi par apane andaaj main jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Bhagwant Mann said in an election meeting in Moti Nagar, Delhi, that Kiran Bedi is the 'insurance policy' of the BJP, Modi if he wins and Bedi if he loses
 
 
 iske saath hi maan ne bijepi ke netaaon par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that leaders like Harshvardhan, Vijay Goel have been waiting for 40 years to form CM and Kiran Bedi, who joined 40 hours ago, was made CM candidate
 maan ne 'aap' se bijepi main shaamil hue vinod kumaar binni or shazia ilmi par bhi hamalaa bolaa
 Attacking PM Modi, he said that 56-inch chest of PM and 300 MP has been installed to defeat Kejriwal
 duusari ore, aam aadmi party ke ek anya netaa kumaar vishwaas ne kiran bedi par nishaanaa sadhate hue aarope lagaaya ki bedi lokapal andolan ke dauraan bijepi par hamale ke khilaaf thim
 Vishwas claimed that Bedi tried to influence several AAP leaders, including Kejriwal, to ensure that the alleged corruption in bjp-ruled states was not exposed
 chunaav ayog ne aaj maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke adhyaksh raaj thakare ko gaiyr marathi logon ke khilaaf unki kathith tippaniyon ke liye or yah daawa karne ke liye 'kaaran bataao' notice jari kiya ki unki party ke satta main aane ke baad unka rajya main pravesh roak diya jayega
 Issuing a notice for violating the Model Code of Conduct at first sight, the Election Commission has given Raj till the morning of October 15 to respond to it
 jawaab na milane par ayog raaj ko koi nayaa sandarbh die bina faisla karegaa
 Raj had reportedly said, 'from the day you give this state in my hand, the jobs created in any industry in Maharashtra will be given only to Marathi boys and girls in the state
 anya rajyon ke logon ko koi rojgaar nahin diya jayega
 Their entry will also be barred
 train se hi unki jaanch shuru kii jaaegi
 'the Commission has written these remarks of Raj, allegedly stated in Marathi in an election meeting for Ghatkopar Assembly seat on October 5 in his notice
 chunaav ayog ne notice main yah zikr bhi kiya he ki raaj thakare ne kathith taur par kaha tha ki agar baahar se aae logon ke paas rahane or kaam ke liye koi vyavastha nahin he to vah chale jaaen
 Do not come to my kingdom
 maharashtra ne duusare rajyon ke logon ko rakhane kaa theka nahin liya he
 Only our boys and girls should get employment here
 kaalnaa vidhansabha seat main 7 oktober ko die raaj ke ek or bhaashan kaa zikr karte hue chunaav ayog ne kaha he ki manase pramukh ne kathith taur par kaha tha agar main satta main aata hum to na keval bade paimaane par rojgaar srujit karuunga balki yah sunishchit bhi karuunga ki sabhi srujit rojgaar maharashtra ke ladke ladakiyon ko milen
 Employment of people from other states in Maharashtra will be discontinued
 sabhi simaaon par pravesh nishedh ke board laga die jaaenge
 Slums are built but our Marathi people do not get the affordable house they deserve
 unhone kaha tha ki anya rajyon ke log aate hai or un ek-ek jhopadi ke ek ek karod rupee lete hai jinamein unka kabja hota he lekin sthaneey log chaal main rahete hai or vah bhi kiraaye par
 According to the commission, 'raj had allegedly said that they come to Maharashtra as private security guards carrying double barrel guns
 aapako yah kahaan se mili, kya aap dakait hai ? lekin duusare rajya se log aate hai or unhen suraksha guard kii naukari mil jaati he 
 And our boys from Maharashtra come for recruitment in our police and these Marathi boys die of heart attack while running five km
 rajya ko mere haath main dijiye, main sabhi nijee suraksha agenciyaan band kar duungaa or maharashtra kii suraksha agency chaalu karuunga tathaa inamen aapako rojgaar duungaa
 An advocate Vinod Tiwari complained to the local police authorities after which the Election Commission took cognizance of Thackeray's comments
 'shikaayat bijepi kii sthaneey ikai ke shrikant bhartiya ne agrasaarit kii thi
 The Commission reminded Thackeray that the provisions of the Model Code of Conduct stated that no party or candidate would engage in any activity that sparked differences or spread hatred or between people of different castes, communities, religions or languages
 Be stressed
 isamen yah bhi kaha gaya he ki janpratinidhitiv kanoon kii dhara 125 main vibhinn virgon ke nagarikon ke bich chunaav ke silsile main dharmik, nasli, jati, saamudayik yaa bhashaayi aadhaar par vaimnasy failaane ko chunavi aparaadh kaha gaya he
 In a special conversation with IANS, PM Narendra Modi talked about his love for nature, his systematic strategy to siege the downtrodden Congress Party and most importantly the former well-wishers of Pakistan and its economic helpers
 yah ek aisi cheez he, jiskaa paryaapt shrey pradhanmantri ko nahin miltaa, jabaki videsh niti kii shaayad yahi ekmaatr uplabdhi rahi he
 The Prime Minister also spoke of his second innings in power during this period, in which he has returned with a stronger support base than ever before
 unase hui baatcheet ke ansh is prakaar hai :aap 'main varsej wild' main najar aae hai
 What is the reason for coming to this very unconventional show as a politician? Sometimes it is good to do something unconventional to highlight a traditional issue
 mujhe lagata he ki sahi uddeshy ke liye baat karne or kaam karne ke liye har vakt sahi hota he
 There is some major issue for every community, every state, every country, every region
 lekin meraa maananaa he ki paryaavaran sangrakshan kaa mudda samooh vishesh ke sabhi muddon ko milakar dekha jaae to usase bhi zyada bada hota he
 It is affecting every human, every plant and every animal in our earth today
 yah manushya kii pariksha kii ghadi he ki ham kitni jaldi or kitne prabhavi tareeke se apane swaarth se upar uthakar puure vishwa ke bhale ke bare main sochen
 India has a great tradition of living in harmony with nature
 puure desh main, rajyon main or vibhinn samskritiyon main prakruti ke vibhinn pahaluon ko pavitra mana jaataa he
 This tradition automatically helps in its preservation
 ek prakaar se yah hamaare desh main prakritik rup se bana sangrakshan tantra he
 Our upbringing is such that we have learned to live in harmony with nature
 hamen keval in aadarsho ko yaad rakhane kii jarurat he
 i think we have succeeded in this too, as recently released figures show that the number of tigers has increased impressively
 yah kaarykram bharat ke sundar or samrudh vanaspati jagat or jeev-jantuon ko duniyabar main darshane kaa ek madhyam rahaa
 There are innumerable places for nature lovers in India, there are many places, which are rich in different types of vegetation, different types of wildlife
 pichley paanch saalon main desh main aane vaale paryatakon kii sankhya main kareeb 50 pratishat kii vruddhi hui he
 i am confident that with various schemes designed to strengthen infrastructure, connectivity and security, we will see more tourists from all over the world coming to experience the beauty of incredible India
 aap congress party ke ghatnakram ko kaise dekhte hai, jahaan rahul gandhi ke yah kehane ke baad ki vah nahin chaahate ki kisi gandhi ko adhyaksh pad mili, sonia gandhi adhyaksh ban gayi?congress main jo hua, vah unke parivaar kaa aantarik maamla he
 i do not want to comment on this
 2014 main yah mana ja rahaa tha ki aap khadi deshon se dostana sambandh sthapit nahin kar paaenge, lekin hamane dekha he ki 2014 se khadi deshon ke saath bharat ke sambandhon main sudhaar aa rahaa he
 At present it would not be wrong to say that India's relations with Gulf countries are the best in the last seven decades
 aap isaki vyakhya kaise karte hai?mujhe lagata he ki iske do pahalu hai
 First, a certain section of people believed that my government and i personally would fail on the foreign policy front, not only in the Gulf region, but also in a broader context
 jabaki sachai yah he ki duniyabar main videsh niti main meri sarkaar kaa safal trek record sabhi ke saamne he
 Rather, after assuming the office of Prime Minister in 2014, my government had welcomed the official visit of the first foreign minister, the Sultan of Oman
 isliye logon ne mere bare main kya sochaa or hakeekat main kya hua, us par unhen aatmachintan karnaa chahie
 Instead i want to focus on another aspect which is the importance of the Gulf region for India
 is kshetra kaa bharat ke saath gaharaa saanskrithik or aitihaasik sambandh he
 There are 90 lakh Indians living here, whose money they send has an unprecedented contribution to our economy and they have also contributed immensely in the prosperity of the region
 maine dekha he ki khadi deshon ke netaa bhartiya pravaasiyon kii maujuudagi ko kaaphi mahatv dete hai or abhibhavak kii tarah unki dekhbhaal karte hai
 This region is also our major partner in ensuring our energy security
 hamaara sambandh ab unke saath kreta-vikreta se bhi kahin zyada badhkar he
 The UAE has participated in our strategic petroleum reserve program and both the UAE and Saudi Arabia are investing in the world's largest refinery project in India
 bhartiya companiyon ko pehali baar kshetra main ofshor oil fields main adhikaar hasil hua he
 i have made special efforts to focus on our foreign policy to strengthen our relations with all countries in the region
 aadhikarik str se lekar raajnneetik str tak kshetra main hamaari pahunch bemisaal he
 i myself have visited the area many times, and we have hosted many leaders of the region in India
 duniyabar ke jin netaaon se meri sabase ghanishtha or garmjoshi bhari baaten hoti hai, unki baat karun to inamen kai khadi kshetra ke netaa hai
 We keep in touch regularly
 or, mujhe lagata he ki is ghanishthata or niyamit sampark ke kaaran hi hamaari niti kaaphi had tak safal hui he
 We did not let any misunderstanding or any doubt come between our relationship
 ham sabhi deshon ke saath behad khule rahe hai or unhone bhi iske badale main hamaare saath garmjoshi bhare or dostana sambandh kaayam kiye hai? meraa drudh vishwaas he ki bharat or khadi deshon ne ek aisi saajhedaari kii vaastavik kshamta ko samajhnaa shuru kiya he, jo aapasi laabh se badhkar he or jo hamaare saajha or vistrut padosi kshetra main hi nahin, balki vishvabhar main shanti, vikaas or samruddhi laa sakati he
 During the 2019 election, many people predicted that you will not get a majority
 kai logon ne kaha tha ki 2014 kaa parinaam ummid se pare or apratyaashit tha
 When you were campaigning, what was your mind saying and how confident were you about winning? There are some people who, due to their prejudice, ideology or any kind of commitments, argue about the defeat of those people , Which they do not like
 ek aisa samay aata he, jab sachai jameen par najar aati he, lekin ye log us sachai ko darkinar karnaa pasand karte hai
 They resort to lies and fake figures to create confusion in the minds of people
 ye hi vahi log hai, jo aisi baaten gadhate hai ki bhaajapa ko bahumat hasil nahin hoga, bhaajapa sarkaar bana legi, lekin use ek nae netaa kii jarurat he, bhaajapa ko nae gathbandhanon kii jarurat he, aadi aadi
 These people also defame him, who does not support his talk
 aise log baar-baar benakaab hue hai, lekin unke vyavhaar main koi badlaav nahin hua
 Electoral analyzes by these people in our country take into account the glamor of parties, potential alliances, families based on decades-old chemistry
 lekin logon or unki aakankshaon ko nazarandaaj kar diya jaataa he
 In 2014 and also in 2019, people who talked to the public and knew their priorities knew what was happening

 Wherever i went, i saw a lot of support for the BJP and the NDA
 logon ne yah tay kar liya tha ki 21veen sadi main bhrashtachar, bhai-bhatijawad or vanshavaad kii raajnneeti sweekaarya nahin he
 We live in an era of politics of development and performance, not in the old era of rhetoric and symbolism? Let me give you an example of this - the Congress party talked about the justice plan
 shaayad yah sabase bada chunavi vaada tha, lekin logon ne aise khokhale vaadon ko darkinar kar diya
 He did not see the sincerity and ability to fulfill such promises in the Congress
 isliye koi aashcharya nahin ki jin logon ne 72,000 rupee kaa vaada kiya tha, ve 72 siten bhi nahin jeet paae

 Fearing the close proximity of the SP-BSP, the BJP is going to provide separate reservation for the backward

 Asked about the option of air strike against Naxalites, Singh said that no one would deny the fact that such things are like supporting mechanisms
 lekin chhattisgarh jaisi jagah, jahaan har jagah barudi surangen or iidi bichhe hue hai, yadi visphot hone se log hataahat hote hai to ghayalon ko aspataal pahunchane main helicopteron kii madad lee ja sakati he taaki unhen samay par chikitsakeey sahaayta mil sake

 darasal, lokapal kii maang vaale san 2011 ke andolan ne bahut jaldi bhrashtachar virdohi andolan kaa rup le liya
 The parallel star that shone with Anna Hazare at that time was Arvind Kejriwal
 arvind kejariwal yani ki eemaandaaree ke sarathi, yuvaaon ke ikon, bhavishya kii sambhaavna tathaa bharat kaa bhavishya aadi-aadi
 What was the result? He became the Chief Minister, and that too the capital of the country, Delhi
 adbhut, avishwasaneey
 Again a strong attraction

 But after reading his book "swarajya" it seemed that he does not think more than politics of mohallas
 sattashin hone ke baad unhone bauni or ochhi raajnneeti ke ek-do nahin, balki rozaana hi koi-na-koi pramaan diya he
 In 1974, under the leadership of Jayaprakash Narayan, he woke up and slept again and woke up in 2011 after thirty-seven years
 aaj vah khud ko chalaa hua mahasoos kar rahaa he, kejariwal ke haathon chalaa hua
 But does Arvind even realize this at all? Does this engineer have the sensitivity to know what the group's dream murderer says? Can there be any greater and heinous sin than committing future feticide? Future generations will seek answers to these questions from their history and Kejriwal will have to answer them
 yahaan iviem mashin kii aad kaam nahin aegi, kyonki itihaas atyant tatasth hota he, or nirmam bhi
 The comments kejariwal jab ganatantr diwas parade kii baadha banakar dharne par baithe the, tab media or buddhijivi varg ne unhen “ek araajaktaavaadi” kaha tha
 But at that time, the country had rejected the views of those intellectuals as biased and spiteful

 and today? Even a foolish person is compelled to think that the lion that roars almost daily by talking about it, even without talking, is silent today
 No outsider is making allegations

 So will silence be the answer to those allegations? The country's Finance Minister has filed a defamation suit against him
 yah vikalp kejariwal ke paas bhi he

 rani lakshmibai ne kam umr main hi british samrajya kii sena se sangram kiya or rankshetra main veergati praapt kii, lekin jite-ji angrejon ko apni jhaansi par kabja nahin karne diya
 The stories of his bravery become more famous because not only we, his enemies were also convinced of his bravery

 She was named Manikarnika and called Manu in the house
 4 baras kii thim, jab maa guzar gayi
 Father Moropant worked in the Peshwa of copper bithur district and Peshwa raised him like his daughter
 pyaar se naam diya chhabili
 As a child, Manu started learning the skills of war with peers like Nana Saheb and Tatya Tope
 1842 main manu kaa vivaah jhaansi naresh gangadhar raav nevalkar ke saath hua jiske baad unhen lakshmibai naam mila

 haalanki british adhikariyon ne unase kai muddon ko lekar baat karnaa chaahi, lekin lakshmi bai ne thukraa diya
 On 23 March 1858, British forces attacked Jhansi
 30 march ko baari bambaari kii madad se angrej kile kii diwaar main send lagane main safal ho gaye
 Laxmibai, seeing herself weakened, came out of Jhansi with a small army troop tied her back to Damodar Rao, Jhansi's last hope
 17 june kii subah lakshmibai apni antim jang ke liye taiyaar huin
 According to Lord Kenning's report, the queen was shot from behind by a soldier
 apana ghoda modate hue lakshmibai ne bhi us sainik par fire kiya lekin vah batch gaya or usne apni talwaar se jhaansi kii rani lakshmibai kaa vadh kar diya
 Bismil was a laughing martyr, had sung before the execution of this poem, he was also an Englishman, he was not only an admirer but also an enemy of the bravery of bravery, Laxmibai's abilities
 pamela di toler is bare main likhti hai ki jhaansi ke raajnneetik agent elice ke man main rani ke liye sahanubhuti thi
 Although her senior officer Malcolm did not like Rani but she wrote in a letter sent to Lord Dalhousie, 'lakshmibai is a highly respected woman and i think she is capable of doing full justice with this post (throne)
 ’ yahi nahin, jhaansi par aakhri karrwai karne vaale sar hew roj ne kaha tha, ‘sabhi vidrohiyon main lakshmibai sabase zyada bahadur or netritvkushal thim

 china or bharat ke bich chal rahi tanatani ke bich raksha mantralay ne centre se jang ke liye taiyaar rahane ke liye 20 hajaar karod rupye ke atirikt bajet kii maang kii he
 This demand has come at a time when the Doklam dispute has been completed for 8 weeks
 2017 main centre kii ore se 2,74,113 karod rupye kaa raksha bajet pesh kiya gaya tha, jo GDP kaa 1
 Was 62 percent
 vahiin ye bajet pichley saal se maatr 6 pratishat zyada tha
 According to defense ministry sources, he has got half of the budget, out of which one third has been spent
 kuch hafte pehle hi raksha mantralay ne sena ke up-pramukh ko yuddh se jude hathiyaaron ko kharidne ko kaha tha
 At the same time, red tape has been reduced in the purchase and sale of military goods
 gauratlab he ki sena ko kisi bhi samay kam se kam 10 din ke yuddh ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hota he
 Earlier this year, customs duty was lifted from import of defense goods
 sutron kii maane, to isaki vajah sena ko kaaphi paisa kharch karnaa padataa tha
 This decision was taken so that the use of goods and weapons made in the country could increase
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle sansad main rakhi gai niyantrak evam mahalekhapareekshak (CAG) kii report main bataaya gaya ki koi yuddh chhidane kii sthiti main sena ke paas mahaj 10 din ke liye hi paryaapt gola-barood he
 Of the total 152 types of ammunition, the CAG report said only 20% ie 31 stocks were found to be satisfactory, while 61 types of ammunition stocks were found to be worryingly low
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah he kibhartiya senake paas kam se kam itnaa gola-barood hona chahie, jisase vah 20 dinon ke kisi saghan takaraav kii sthiti se nipat sake
 However, before this, the army had to keep 40 days of intensive war-fighting ammunition in its War Vestage Reserve (WWR), which was reduced to 20 days in 1999
 aise main kaig kii yah report golabarood kii baari killat ujagar karti he
 The 'india Today Conclave', which started in the shadow of the famous 9 / 11 attacks, is no longer an introduction
 yahi vah manch he, jahaan se pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pehali baar bataur mukhyamantri apane sushasan ke nazariye kaa khaakaa pesh kiya tha
 It was here that the then chairman of ISRO
 radhakrishnan ne mangal grah mishan ke vishwavyaapee asar kaa sanket diya tha
 Hillary Clinton chose this forum two years before the US presidential election for the first time to explain what the importance of India was
 ek ugantarkari varsh ke baad conklev apane 13wein saal main phir yojit ho rahaa
 In the meantime, Narendra Modi ascended the throne of Delhi with a historic mandate in the Lok Sabha elections, which sounds like an exciting film plot
 iageies ne apni barbar hinsa se aatank kii hadein paar kar di hai, vaishvik arthvyavastha apni anischitata se mulkon ke hosh phakhta kar rahi he or afghanistan se nato fouj kii vaapasi loktantr main ek apratyaashit prayog kaa manch muhaiyaa kara rahi he
 Indeed, the face of the world is changing and like the magazine that has kept a finger on the beats of the country and the world for the last 40 years, this conclave will also take stock of the activities on the domestic and external front
 vichaaron or daleelon ke is utsav main har kshetra kii behtareen or vilakshan shakhsiyaten apni baat rakhengi
 Whether it is the 'make in India' campaign or collaborative federalism or the field of skill building or infrastructure building
 charchit mukhyamantri, nai li banane vaale kaarobaari or apane kaam ke prati gambhir mantri aane vaale kal kii apni ruparekha se hamen parichit karaayenge
 The echo of the foreign war front and violent campaigns will also be heard in the ISIS session
 unke changul se chhootakar aae logon ke saath aatank ke puraane thikaane afghanistan ke nae mukhiya abdulla abdulla bhi apni baat rakhenge
 The best talents of the world will also come to you here
 cricket ke bhagwaan sachin tendulkar maidan kii baarikiyon par roshni daalenge
 Spiritual guru Deepak Chopra will teach us the tricks to keep the mind, body and mind under control
 shatranj ke jaadugar vishvanathan anand apni jabardast sooyeeboojh se parichit karaayenge
 The Conclave will also reflect its old and deep tradition
 india today patrika immergency ke dauraan shuru hui thi
 Like the magazine in the matter of freedom of expression, the Conclave has a tough and candid stand, whether it is the case of the Dalai Lama or Salman Rushdie
 is baar apni bolne kii aazaadee ke liye aalochana kaa shikaar hui eibi toli ko bhi vivaad bhadakne ke baad pehali baar apni baat rakhane kaa mauka milegaa
 The conclave is also a platform for the reception of new ideas
 isliye isamen hissaa lene vaale nai takneekee khojon ke izhaar ke bhi chashmadid ho paaenge, chaahe vah 3di printing ho yaa atyaadhunik car ingine
 It is clear that the Conclave cannot leave its permanent sense, that is, there will be a session of serious dialogue related to maintaining peace with Pakistan
 lakhon sambhaavnaaon se sarabor hamaare desh main in sab gambhir vimarshon ke bich thodi-si jagah manoranjan kii bhi to he
 Providing equal opportunities for all the talent to blossom and open up, Bollywood is always brightened by the freshness of new stars and new stories
 katrina caff se lekar ranvir singh or lija heden tak ne film industry main aisi nai urja bhar di he ki har shuukravaar hamaare ghar kaa najdiki cinemaghar hamaari jindagiyon ko nayaa arth detaa he
 Of course, the two biggest challenges of the 21st century are the war on terror and the fight against poverty
 inase har roj duniya kaa khaakaa badal rahaa he
 With two days and two nights of glory, India Today Conclave will be able to present to us a better outline of future India

 Interestingly, two and a half years after the formation of the Sixth Assembly, this committee has put its first report in the House, and that too within a month of the petition being filed
 greater kailash se vidhayak saurabh bharadwaj kii adhyakshata vaali is cameti ke sadasyon main unkelawa 8 sadsy hai,jinamein vipaksh kaa koi bhi sadsy nahin he
 Actually, the story of this report of the petition committee starts on 29th May this year
 pandav nagar ke nivasee niraj kumaar kii yachika jisamen ye aarope lagaaya gaya tha ki peedblyoody auramasidine naalon kii safai main kotahi barti heko vidhansabha adhyaksh ne jaanch ke liye samiti ke paas bheja
 The committee hearing started on June 1, interesting aspect is that just a few days before this hearing i
e
 on May 25, the Chief Minister of Delhi took out a circular and was responsible for the reduction in the work of PWD department, MCD and other agencies
 Was directly given to the Chief Secretary of PWD
 is cameti ne 1 june or 22 june ke bich 4 baithken bhi kin,saath hi saath teen dinon kaa field visit bhi kiya
 The committee found that the report of the principal secretary of the PDWD was based on false facts and false
 saaf kiye gaye naalon main bhi safai nahin pai gai
 The committee also found mcd's report to be incorrect
 galat report pesh karne ko samiti ne vidhaan sabha ne sadan kiavamananaa paaya
 The committee said that in three days, the principal secretary of the PWD went with them on a field visit, on which the committee expressed its resentment
 cameti ne ye bhi paaya ki safai ke lievatsap numbercholekar bhi peedblyoody sachiv utsahit nahin the,kyonki unhen lagata tha ki aisa karne se kai or kism kii jaankariyaan bhi aaengi
 The committee is not ready for the PWD monsoon despite Napaya's claims
 cameti neye bhi paaya ki court,alji,siem or mantri ke kehane ke baavjood vibhaag ne kaam nahin kiya
 The committee found Principal Secretary of the department, Ashwini Kumar guilty of not leading the department properly
 camet die yesujhavamukhya sachiv ye sunishchat karen ki mukhyamantri ne 26 may kojo aadesh die unka paalan ho
 The Chief Secretary should investigate himself in case of wrong report
 mukhya sachivnaalon kii saaf-safai ke liye aadhunik vyavastha sunishchit karen
 The Chief Secretary should examine the contracts given for cleaning the drains
 mukhya sachiv galat report dene vaale adhikariyon kii jimmedaari tay karen
 Since Ashwini Kumar is the secretary of the PWD and Vigilance Department, she should be removed from both these posts till the investigation is complete, so that the investigation is impartial
 ek maheene ke bheetar mukhya sachiv jaanch report vidhansabha main rakhen

 tivi sho kamedi nits vid kapil chhodane ke aaropon par aakhirkaar gutthi yani sunil grover ne chuppi tod di he
 When the English newspaper Times of India asked Sunil Grover to leave the show due to demands for more remuneration, Sunil said, "my contract with the channel was ending
 maine bas channel se apane mehtaane main badhotari kii maang kii, jo meraa adhikaar he, lekin yah baat unhen pasand nahin ai
 "if you leave your wife, can't you get married again" and Sunil says about the loss of relationship with the channel, "initially, the channel replied 'no' to the matter of raising money
 baad main unhone mujhase freelans karne ko kaha
 But now they want me not to use Gutthi's name anywhere else
 to kya iskaa matlab yah he ki agar aapaki bivi chhod jaae to aap duusari shaadi nahin kar sakate
 "I have created the character of Guththi" Sunil has rejected those things, saying that the character of Gutthi has been made by Kapil Sharma
 sunil kehete hai, 'kapil ne mujhase kabhi aisa nahin kaha
 Misunderstanding is being created between us
 ham donon bahut achche dost hai
 But i have also played Gutthi in Comedy Circus before and i brought Gutthi to Comedy Nights too
 ''koi mujhase jabardastee nahin kar saktaa, dost kii tarah ho baat'sunil kehete hai, 'agar koi mujhase yah kahata he ki main gutthi kaa kirdaar chhod duun to iskaa matlab yah kahana he ki main kaam karnaa band kar duun
 i have come here to act and that is my job
 ho saktaa he main gutthi kaa kirdaar phir nahin nibhaauun, lekin main chaahunga ki iske liye ham dost kii tarah baat karen
 Nobody can force me
 ''duusari gutthi se nahin hogi koi aapatti'sunil grover kehete hai ki agar channel yaa kapil sho main duusari gutthi laate hai to unhen isse koi etraj nahin he
 Sunil said, 'I am in the best phase of my career right now
 mere paas kai ophers hai
 But i wouldn't mind if someone else plays a role in Comedy Nights
 sho ne mujhe bada plateform diya he, jisane meri jindagi badal di he
 Controversy has made me bigger
 'vahiin, vaiakom 18 kaa kahana he ki kaarykram, kaarykram se jude har kalakaar ke sabhi bauddhik sampada par hamaara ekmaatr swaamitv adhikaar he

 5 Stardirector: Bhushan Patel Artist: Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Groverhorr The film is a genre which has been doing many experiments in Bollywood over the years
 isamen sex ko bhi jamkar parosa ja rahaa he or diarector 3di se lekar kai tarah ke hytech istemaal kar chuke hai
 But perhaps we are still where we were today in terms of story
 alon isi naam kii thai film se prerit he, lekin diarector bhushan patel ne ise kai tarah ke mode dene or horex banane ke chakkar main kahin se kahin pahunchaa diya he
 Bipashako is called the Horror Queen in Bollywood anyway, in such a way she has acted according to her title
 unhen dar ke expreshans dene kaa kaaphi anubhav he, lekin horer filmein banane vaale hamaare diarectors ko thodaa maior hona hoga
 There are so many damned sisters in the story who are connected
 donon aise hi hameshaa jude rahane kii baaten karti hai
 But a boy comes and their life changes
 unhen usase pyaar ho jaataa he
 a sister is upset and asks to separate
 doctor donon ko alag karte hai, or usee dauraan ek haadasa ho jaataa he
 Then the life of one sister makes the other sister difficult
 phir shuruyaat hoti he bipasha basu style chikhon kii, jinamein darshakon ko daraane ke liye tarah-tarah kii shaamil hai
 Bhootpurana also comes, and there are many ways to exorcise
 jo hansaate bhi hai
 In order to comfort the heroine, the hero performs many types of hotness
 isse kahani kaa flo thodaa tuutata he
 The mind gets entangled with fear and sex
 star apilbipasha to horer kii duniya kaa bada naam ban chuki hai or sex apil to unamem kamaal kii he hi
 But now after doing a few films in another genre, Bipasha should move to next-door films because we have become accustomed to seeing expressions related to her fears
 unhone jahaan apni acting dikhaane kii bharsak koshish kii he, usase zyada unki koshish apni toned body dikhaane kii he, bilkul apni fitness dividi kii tarah
 Karan Singh is seen doing the same

 At the same time, he indicated that the agreement is unlikely before the second summit to be held for the two world leaders
 donon netaaon kii mulaakaat ko lekar bazaar garm he
 However, at the beginning of the year, Kim showed his attitude and gave a sharp reply to the US that he was ready for talks but he would have to change his stand
 kim ne kaha tha, 'vah 2019 main bhi america ke saath ek summit karne ke liye taiyaar hai, lekin iskaa matlab ye nahin he ki vah kisi dabaav main hai
 'he said,' America needs to change the attitude that is pressuring us

 However, it has been such that through social media on mobile phones, people are giving more time to the language of damnation instead of hospitality
 aaie jaane sahityas ajtak main unki 10 khaas baaten
 
 
 1
 shabdkosh main jahaan shabdon ke arth hote hai vahiin sahitya main shabdon ke bhav hote hai
 This is the reason why we remember the names of litterateurs throughout the life
 2
 They speak of making Hindi a business language just like English
 ise chhodane par khud se chhot jane kii baat kehete hai
 It is said to give him his due
 hindi ko rajbhasha ke bajaay lok kii bhashaa banaae jane kii vakaalat karte hai
 3
 ve fasebuk jaise saamaajik madhyamon par hone vaali bahes par tanj karte hai ki kaise vahaan desh-duniya ko badalane kii kranti chal rahi he
 The movement is going on
 internet ke daur main usase dur rahane par ve kehete hai ki desh chalata nahin machalata he
 The issue does not get resolved
 4
 Arguments have disappeared from social media
 ham to satya khoj rahe hai
 People like Gandhi, Ram and Krishna were born as humans
 phir dhire-dhire vyaktitv bane
 5
 rana kehete hai ki wo ramlila main ravan bananaa chaahate the lekin us samay umr aade aati thi
 People older than us used to become Ravan
 ve tanj kas dete the ki tum is laayak nahin
 If you are worthy now, no one gives this role
 6
 They advocate confidence in speaking in English or in Hindi
 ve bhashaa ke bajaay bhav ko tarjeeh dene kii baat karte hai
 Although English is associated with economy
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki sara maamla gaddamgadd ho jaataa he
 7
 angrejidan hona koi badi baat nahin
 In the end only the thoughts remain
 aapaki soch mahatvapurn hoti he
 The diversity of different parts of the country is its identity
 hamaara desh to vividhta ke liye hi janaa jaataa he
 8
 baag main har phool kii apni mahatta he or shaayad yahi vajah he ki bengal se chalakar aane vaala rasagulla puure desh main pasand kiya jane lagata he
 9
 raajma punjab se nikal kar puure desh main pasand kiya jane lagata he
 They attribute the diversity of the country to beauty and strength

 rajasthan ke bundi shahar main betiyon ko pita kii arthi ko kandha dene par bahishkaar karne vaale panch patelon par sarkaar ne sakhti dikhaai he
 All the Panch Patels who heard the order have fled, leaving the Mohalla
 bundi main shok main duube ek parivaar par khap panchayat ne farmaan sunaaya tha ki samaaj main is parivaar se koi rishta nahin rakhega
 The panchayat was upset about why the daughters carried the body of the father on their shoulders
 iske baad panchayat main panchon ne shart rakhi thi ki mritak kii patni sahit chaaron betiyaan haath jodakar panchayat main samaaj ke saamne maafi maange, tab log antim sanskaar main shaamil honge
 The daughters stumbled upon the decree and solemnized the father of the people of the society alone as per the wishes of the father
 asal main, bundi ke regar mohall main panchayat is baat par naaraaz ho gai ki betiyon ne pita kiarthi ko kyonkandha diya
 The panchayat said that daughters cannot go to the crematorium
 mukhaagni keval bete hi de sakate hai, agar bete nahi hai to sage sambandhi main purush hi mukhagni denge
 Varanasi: Even after the protest, the daughter-daughter-in-law gave her support to the mother's bier that Durga Shankar, a teacher by profession, died on Sunday night
 is dauraan maukey par pahunchin chaar betiyon ne durgashankar ko kandhaa diya to raigar samaaj ne panch patel panchayat bula liye or farmaan jari kar diya ki in betiyon sahit unki maa aakar unase haath jodakar maafee maange tab jaakar vah antim sanskaar main shaamil honge
 But during this time the daughters, including their relatives, did not listen to the decree of the Khap Panchayat
 betiyon ne farmaan ko nakaarte hue antim sanskaar ke liye pita kii arthi ko apane kandho par uthaa liya
 Due to this, the angry Panchas ousted the family from the society
 maamla police-prashasan tak pahunchaa to panch patel muhalla chhodkar bhaag nikle
 After the intervention of the state government, the Mohallawalas have said for fear of police-administration that they will support the victim's family

 India is adopting a very tough stand on the extradition of Mehul Choksi, one of the main accused in the thousands of crores of PNB bank scam, and now he is likely to be in a tight spot soon
 saal ke shuruyaat main bank ghotaalaa saamne aane ke baad faraar chokasee ne bharat aane se bachane ke liye carabian desh antigua or barbuda kii naagarikta hasil kar lee thi
 But now the Indian government has started looking for other options for extradition with Antigua
 bharat kaa antigua ke saath pratyrpan sandhi nahin he
 India has notified that the two countries fall under the agreement made under the Commonwealth countries
 mehul chokasee ke antigua main maujuud hone or vahaan kii naagarikta hasil hone kii khabar saamne aane ke baad bhartiya jaanch agenciyaan un tak pahunch banane kii koshishon main juty he or use apni giraft main laane ke liye sabhi sambhavit vikalp talashne main juty thim
 The Indian government has been relentless because of the failure of Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, the main accused in the bank scam, to run away and find them
 isse pehle antigua or barbuda sarkaar kii ore se suzav diya gaya tha ki 1993 kepratrpan kanoonki dhara 7 ke tahat isaki gunjaaish banati he ki nai dilli ke anurodh ke anusaar bhagode hira kaarobaari mehul chokasee ko bharat waapas bheja ja sake
 An English newspaper claimed in its report on behalf of the government of Kentigua and Barbuda that the Foreign Minister, epchet Green and Solicitor General Martin Kamako gave the Indian Ambassador during the meeting
 duusari ore, sibiai ne antigua sebhagode hira kaarobaari choksike pratyrpan sambandhi prakriya pehle hi shuru kar di thi
 The CBI made the request under the rules of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) to which both countries are bound
 bharat ko yah rasta isliye apnaanaa pad rahaa he, kyonki antigua or bharat ke bich pratyrpan ko lekar kisi prakaar kaa koi samjhauta nahin he
 However, both countries are covered under the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC)
 seol main hue ji20 sammelan ke dauraan bharat ne UNCAC sandhi par sahmati jataate hue is par hastakshar kiye the or antigua ne bhi is par dastakhat kiye hai
 Under this, the countries signing the UNCAC will have to accept the UN treaty and implement it themselves
 mehul chokasee konaagarikta die jane par uthe vivaad parentigua or barbuda kii ore se safai di gai or kaha gaya ki naagarikta dene se pehle unhone 2017 main bhartiya agenciyon or passport offis se chokasee ke bare main jaankaree maangi thi
 In response to which Indian agencies had not lodged any objection to Choksi
 tab bharat ne antigua ko yah spasht kiya tha ki chokasee ke khilaaf kisi prakaar ke ghotaale kaa yaa phir dhokhadhadi kaa aarope nahin he
 After this, Antigua granted Choksi citizenship of his country

 The film 'super Nani' released today is the story of a woman who makes many sacrifices to groom her family, but her husband and her children do not respect her at all
 
 
 aise maahaul main, us aurat kaa navasa (beti kaa betaa) america se aata he or satai hui apni nani ko nai disha detaa he
 
 
 Now the world is in the footsteps of this nanny, and grandchildren get together to bring the family on the right path
 
 
 film main 'super nani' ke role main hai rekha, navaase kii bhoomika nibhaai he sharaman joshi ne, or rekha ke pati bane hai randhir kapur
 
 
 The film 'super Nani' attempts to give the message of respecting women
 
 
 yah bataaya gaya he ki agar aurat apane ghar, pati or bacchon ko sanvaarane ke liye apni khushiyon or khwahishon kii qurbaani detii he, to iskaa arth yah katai nahin he ki usamen koi pratibha nahin
 
 
 It has also been shown that if the husband does not respect his wife, then the children also will not respect the mother
 
 
 magar afsos is baat kaa he ki film 'super nani' main sandesh ke alaava kuch nahin he
 
 
 The screenplay seems childish, and while watching the film i felt as if i am watching a TV serial
 
 
 vaisaa hi parivaar, ek ghar, ek aurat, jiske paas koi azaadi nahin, ek naati, jo uski duniya badalane main laga rahata he
 
 
 Let us also tell you that even today's TV serials have surpassed this film
 
 
 aajkal ke serialon main aise vishay to shaayad mil jaaenge, lekin shaayad aisa pati nahin milegaa, jo janata or media ke saamne apni sidhi-saadi patni kii beizzati kare
 
 
 Yes, some old songs and a few modeling scenes have been filmed to show the beauty of Rekha
 
 
 film ke nirdeshak indra kumaar ne 'dil', 'betaa' or 'raja' jaisi filmein banaai hai, jinamein family drama, romance, music or kamedi kaa behtareen sangam dekhne ko mila tha
 
 
 Apart from these, Indra Kumar has also made vigorous comedy films like 'masti' and 'dhamaal', but according to me, 'super Nani' is the weakest film of Indra Kumar, because only one or two scenes of this film make you laugh
 You can, but many scenes will make you feel melodrama-filled and strange
 
 
 is film ke liye meri reating he - 2 star
