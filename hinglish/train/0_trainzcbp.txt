 ‘tumhaare paas ek vikalp he, bete
 Either you live your life like a victim, wear your spoiled childhood like a thread on your arm, keep sympathy with those who are nothing to you, or else get out of it
 apane dard or apane gusse kaa rachanaatmak istemaal karo or aage bad jaao
 i did the latter
 isiilie main vahaan hum jahaan aaj hum
 Do you know, one thing is common between you and me
 ek aisa bachapan jisamen pita nahin the
 
 
 'I was talking to Rahul while i was walking through the vast, grand grounds of Spiti
 vah sachmuch ishwar kii bhoomi thi
 i am thankful to my daughter Pooja, who was shooting for the first film under her direction, and we were in Kibber, the highest village in the world where it is possible to go by car
 yah rahul or mere liye bahut durlabh avasar tha jab ham donon kai saalon baad saath saath the
 In fact, after that painful night of 1985 when i moved out of his house, when he was barely three years old
 tab main kahan jaanata tha ki jivan uski pariksha legaa or usko majaboor hokar us vikalp ko chunanaa padegaa
 'why do you want to call him Mohammed, son?' My mother asked, who had spent his whole life hiding his Muslim identity
 usko dar tha ki is tathakthith dharmanirpeksh desh main bhi musalamaanon ko ‘anya’ ke rup main dekha jaataa tha
 'because i want your Muslim heritage to continue in some form through my son', i replied
 meri maa kii baat aakhirkaar chal nikali jab unhone meri anglo-indian patni or mere behad tarksheel sant sareekhe maharashtrin brahman padosi ke saath milakar dabaav banaaya, to mere bete kaa naam rahul urf sani rakhaa gaya
 Looking back, i am afraid of what would have happened to my son in 2009 if he had been named Mohammed Bhatt
 rahul kaa janm bachapan kii meri premika loren brit (kiran bhatta) ke saath mere rishton ko rafu karne ke kram main hui thi, jo tab tak taar-taar ho gaya tha
 And i remember that i once again adopted paternity with all my heart and mind
 sanni or mere saath hone kii durlabh or aarambhik yaaden ubhar padin
 Dawn is erupting on Pali Hill
 main ek berozegaar, or sangharshrat filmkaar hum
 i roam Sunny in the ply hill at the pram, taking her for a morning walk
 ek thodaa prasiddh abhinayta jo acchhee tarah nashe main he,der raat kii party se laut rahaa he, jab vah mujhe apratyaashit rup se pita ke avatar main apane chote bachche ke saath dekhtaa he to uskaa dil pigal jaataa he
 He leans over Sunny and smells of alcohol all around him, he whispers, 'will you remember that your father is taking you on a morning walk at that time? Or will you forget this, like all sons? ”he kisses me while saying this and moves towards his car
 pataa nahin kyon, lekin vah mjedaar smriti aaj mujhe dravit kar detii he
 Memories
 
 
 smritiyaan mere jivan kii saamagree rahi hai
 Man is after all a memory
 jab main apane andar dekhtaa hum to paata hum ki mere andar mere bete ke saath meri smritiyaan nahin hai
 a flourishing career, a second marriage, my search for truth, all of these kind of captured my life, and i had less and less time to spend with my son (I married my second marriage Hardly any time spent with daughters)
 haalanki main har tarah se unke liye prabandh karata rahaa, or ek aise pita kii tarah se unke har bure daur main upasthit rahaa, mujhe lagata he ki choti-choti baton ko nanandaaj kar diya jaataa he
 i have not been able to give him time in day-to-day work, the normal life that father and beta spend together
 us tarah se samay jab main asafal or berozegaar tha
 The bitter truth is that i have become what i did not want to be
 puure jivan main apane pita ke upar inhon baton ke liye iljaam lagaataa rahaa
 And now i was doing the same
 main yah chahta tha ki isko thik kar paaun
 But did not know how
 or ek din bhagya ne mujhe uskaa mauka de diya jo main chahta tha
 In fact, it seemed that the whole world had created such an atmosphere that the time had come for me to get a chance
 ‘mujhe lagata he ki yah david hedli jiske bare main guptchar agenciyaan baat kar rahi hai vahi aadmi he jisase main apane fitness trainer saathi vilaas varaq ke madhyam se jaanata tha
 And i am certain that the Rahul whom they are constantly referring to is me ', my son told me on the phone
 yah ek or din tha, lekin mere jivan ke sabase kathin din ke parade khul gaye
 It was entertainment for the world
 mere liye, yah kisi pralay se kam nahin tha
 'what should i do? Pooja and Mummy were saying that i should consult you and go to the police
 mujhe kya karnaa chahie, papa?’ usne poocha, saamaanya dikhne kii koshish karata hua, lekin main uski aawaaj main dar ko mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 It was strange
 duniya ke sabhi shaharon ko chhodkar aisa lagata tha ki david hedli ne is shahar ko chunaa
 And more than that, leaving millions of people of this city, chose my son for friendship! i was in the biggest dilemma of my life
 duniya main, jahaan ham sahas, or karttavya ko lekar baat karte rahete hai, abhibhavakon ko is tarah se is tarah se taiyaar kiya jaataa he ki ve khataron se bacchon ko dur rakh saken
 Don't we prepare our children to take care of their safety, avoid strangers, keep their seat belts on, and look around while crossing the street? But you are what you do Are not what you say you should do
 hamaare puure parivaar kii pariksha kii ghadi thi
 Did we have to sit quietly and watch, or take the risk that fate had chosen for us, taking the risk of coming into the public eye? The first reaction was to shun this tsunami which was slowly moving towards us
 
 hamane aise kai udhaaharan dekhe the ki jisamen 26 / 11 ke baad janata kii bhaawanaaon ne jaanch agenciyon ko anek maasoom, tathaa khaas taur par anek musalmaan ladakon ko ke khilaaf akaaran amanviya tathaa anyaaypurna dhang se kaam kiya tha
 At the same time, it was also thought that right-wing forces with whom i have fought many bitter battles would take advantage of this opportunity to rip me off and harm my son
 main yah samaj gaya tha ki yah kisi durbhagyapurna aadmi ke bare main koi televijan sho nahin tha ki main ek batan dabaakar apane televijan set ko band kar detaa
 It was real life, and it was my boy, and he was on the other side of the telephone, waiting for an answer that could change his life
 maine usase ek sawaal poocha, ‘kya tumne aisa kuch kiya he jo tum mujhe nahin bataa rahe ho? kyonki agar tumne kiya he to tumko apane karmon kaa fal bhugatna padegaa, bete
 But if you have not done, then there is no need to fear you
 apana sar ooncha karke police ke paas jaao
 He smiled before placing it, 'papa, i have done nothing wrong
 meraa bharosa kijiye
 'what happened after that was good as well as bad
 bura isliye kyonki vahi samskruti jo un logon ke prati shradhanjali dene kaa naatak kar rahi thi jinhone 26 / 11 ke katleam main apane jaan kii qurbaani di, vahi log waapas mudakar in do logon ke upar sawaal uthaa rahe the
 Rahul, Vilas, our family and i had become foodies for the news hungry after that night
 dakshinpanthi takatein samachar channelon ke saath milakar jaan boojhkar mere bete ke ird gird andeh paidaa karne kaa kaam kar rahe the or unako bouna banane ke kaam main lage the
 What i could never understand was how instead of praising these two courageous youths, they helped the unscrupulous investigative agencies to go inside this case and investigate the actions of this double agent
 , All came to the same conclusion that they are guilty of treason
 asal main, to ve nayak the
 Vilas even lost his job and has not got it back till date
 yah kahana uchit hoga ki enie, mumbai police or guptchar shakha ke adhikariyon ne in ladakon ke saath bahut sammanpurvak vyavhaar kiya or saarvajanik rup se na sahi to nijee taur par unki peeth thapthapai
 But my so-called friends and relatives suddenly hid in the background, fearing that a terrible crime might be uncovered somewhere
 main, jo kisi ke liye bhi khadaa ho jaataa tha, achaanak khud ko akelaa mahasoos karne laga
 Me and my brave daughter Pooja built a wall around Sunny and fought on a daily basis, waiting for the stream to turn towards us
 lekin ve hamaare liye bahut acha daur bhi tha
 Because my son and i came so close for the first time in life
 use yah samaj main aane laga ki vah aadmi jo 1985 kii madhyaraatri main dur chalaa gaya tha asal main kahin gaya nahin tha
 It was a strange irony, that the years i spent away, to make a name for myself, he helped me to save it
 kyonki agar main prasiddh nahin hota, koi nahin hota jiskaa sach bolne ke liye sammaan kiya jaataa tha, to mujhe nahin lagata ki meraa betaa sahi-salaamat baahar nikal paaya hota
 If he had been the son of an anonymous man, would they have seen him the same way? When i am writing this, my heart is beating for many innocent people who have not been so lucky
 kuch pracheen janajatiyon main,jab betaa bada hota he to vah kisi junglee jaanavar ko maar detaa he apane pita ko dikhaane ke liye ki vah bada ho chukaa he
 For me, Rahul's readiness to open himself, and the respect and fearlessness he faced during those terrible days when some people were accusing him of being traitors, and his desire to keep this whole story open There are signs that the boy i used to take for a morning walk many summers ago was now grown up
 or us aadmi kii yatra abhi shuru hi hui he

 Nitish Kumar, once again sitting on the peak of power in Bihar, has directly challenged the power of the Center as soon as he became CM
 bhoomi adhigrahan bill ke khilaaf 24 ghanton ke upwas ke baad ab vah iske khilaaf anna andolan kaa saath dene vaale hai
 Addressing party workers during the fast on Saturday, Nitish said that this is a black law for farmers and it will not be tolerated at any cost
 apane sambodhan main party netaaon ko kaaryakartaaon se nitish ne kaha, 'sarkaar jis bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko laana chaahati he vah kisaanon ke hit par prahaar karne vaala kanoon he
 We oppose this black law
 yah kanoon agar paarit ho bhi gaya to ham ise bihar main lagu nahin hone denge
 In support of Anna, Nitishnitish Kumar said that 76 percent people in Bihar are based on agriculture
 angrejon ke samay jo kanoon tha usamen sarkaar ko puraa adhikaar tha
 But in 2013 a new law came which empowered the farmers
 ab sarkaar phir se nayaa kanoon laana chaahati he, jo vot to kisaanon se leti he lekin kaam corporate ke liye karti he
 Nitish said that he will have support for Anna Hazare's movement against this black law and he will also support his 3-month march
 kiske achche dinbihar ke siem ne centre sarkaar ko nishane par lete hue kaha ki jab se sarkaar bani he yah saaf ho gaya he ki kiske achche din aae hai
 Nitish said, 'their model of development will never succeed
 kyonki vikaas kaa ye najariya hi galat he
 The government has a majority in the Lok Sabha, but in the Rajya Sabha it is trying to force
 ham virodh ke liye virodh nahin kar rahe hai balki apane anubhav se kah rahe hai
 About his fast, Nitish said that sitting on a fast gives a good feeling

 In the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the central government decided that now every caste quota will be fixed to give reservation to different castes within the OBC in central government jobs
 yani ki pichhadaa varg ke liye jo aarakshan he usamen ab aarakshan ke bheetar aarakshan kii vyavastha hogi
 The Central Government will soon form a committee to make quota within the OBC quota which will submit its report within 12 weeks
 aarakshan ke bheetar aarakshan dene ke liye kya tarika apanaaya jayega or kya iskaa aadhaar jati hogi yaa aarthik sthiti iskaa faisla kamishan par choda gaya he
 In another decision, the cabinet has increased the income of creamy layer from 6 lakh to 8 lakh annually to get the benefit of reservation
 yani jin pariwaron kii salanaa aamadani 8 lakh rupye tak he vah krimi layer ke bheetar nahin aaenge or unhen aarakshan kaa laabh miltaa rahegaa
 Talking about the cabinet decision, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that this step is being taken so that all the castes within it can get the benefit of OBC reservation
 kendriya mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki pichhadaa varg ayog ne 2011 main hi yah sifarish kii thi ki obisi cote ke bheetar aarakshan kaa vargeekaran kiya jaae
 After that the Parliamentary Standing Committee also made such a recommendation
 jetali ne daawa kiya ki is faisle ke lagu hone ke baad aarakshan kaa phayda milane main pakshpaat nahin hoga or gaiyr barabari khatm hogi
 Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan also welcomed the decision of the Central Government and said that his Lok Janshakti Party had long been demanding that classification within the OBC should be done
 paswan ne kaha ki bihar samet nau anya rajyon main pehle se hi ati pichhadaa ke aadhaar par vargeekaran kiya gaya tha
 It is believed that one of the major reasons for Nitish Kumar's success in Bihar was that he strengthened his vote bank by social engineering of new ways and by dividing ultra backward and extreme Dalits among backward and Dalits

 It is also well known that in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, most of the voters of Yadav caste stand more strongly with Lalu Yadav's RJD and Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party than BJP
 is faisle se bijepi obisi jatiyon main yadav ko chhodkar duusare jatiyon ke bich apni pakad ko majboot banaaegi

 But, if a leader who is out of power for a long time gets a helicopter on his birthday, then it is bound to be discussed
 chhattisgarh ke purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi ke 29 april ko janmdin par aisa hi kuch khaas hone ja rahaa he
 They will get a helicopter in gifts
 helicopter beshak second-hand he lekin he to helicopter hi
 The helicopter is not yet flying in the sky of Chhattisgarh, but the political corridor has become hot due to the news of its knocking here
 jogi kheme ke netaaon kaa daawa he ki unhone apni jeb dhili kar ye helicopter kharida he
 After being expelled from the Congress, Jogi formed his own party under the name Chhattisgarh Janata Congress
 unke putr amit jogi chhattisgarh main vidhayak hai
 Leaders of the main opposition Congress in Chhattisgarh allege that the BJP government in the state is helping to carry this helicopter to Jogi from the back door
 haalanki tohfe main milane vaale helicopter ko lekar ajit jogi or unke vidhayak putr ne philhal chuppi saadh rakhi he
 Ajit Jogi is trying hard to get his old bully in state politics

 It is expected that this helicopter from Delhi will reach Raipur on 15 April

 Jogi's attempt is to leave the Congress behind in terms of publicity
 bijepico ummid he ki jogi sirf congress ke armaanon par hi pani pherenge
 As a result, the Congress will go through a phase of Partition and in such a situation the BJP will be able to hold power again in the 2018 Assembly elections

 Eventually, the feeling is becoming stronger that India has to do something for its cities
 desi shaharon ne kai dashakon tak galat praathamiktaaon kaa khamiyaja bhugta he
 These cities have suffered as a result of the advice of leftist and socialist intellectuals and the strict adherence of Nehruvian leaders to them
 bharat ko yah ehsaas sabase adhik hona chahie ki badi sabhyataaen panpin, fali-phulin or shaharon ke saath hi khatm ho gayi
 We have mastered to strangle our cities in a planned way
 shuruyaat is vicitra dharna se hoti he ki yadi bharat kaa vikaas hona he to iske gramin kshetra kaa vikaas or samruddhi jaruri he, shaharon kaa nahin
 Gandhi may have said that India lives in villages, but he certainly would not have given an opinion about the elimination of development from urban India
 jabaki shahari or gramin kshetra ek hi desh rupi sharir ke do hisse hai, ek ke vikaas ke bina duusare kaa vikaas sambhav nahin he
 Cities are like tree roots
 ve nae avishkaar, puunji, maanav shram, suraksha, nyaay, swatantraaa or maanav vikaas ke liye anivaary anya suvidhaayen adhik kargar tareeke se uplabdh karvaa sakate hai
 They are able to do this because there are a large number of people from different residential areas, living in small residential areas and settlements, and they can easily interact and exchange services
 dilachasp baat yah ki shahar is kaam ko adhik kargar tareeke se anjaam dete hai
 For example, a person living in a village lives on a much larger plot than an urban one
 shaharon main adhik jansankhya ghanatv se yah parilakshith hota he
 Apart from this, if cities do not develop, then people will use more fertile land of villages
 gaanv achche jal sroton ke nikat hi based hote hai or krishi kii drushti se vah jameen behad upjau hoti he
 Pollution also occurs in villages, but we ignore it
 urvarkon or kitnashkon kaa istemaal, krishi kachare ko jalaane se or dijal water pump kaa istemaal bhi pradooshan kaa kaaran banate hai
 In other words, there are similar problems of cities and villages, the only difference is that in cities they are clearly visible
 shahar is myne main bhi phaayde main rahete hai ki kai tarah ke log ek saath aakar aisi samasyaon ke samaadhaan main jute jate hai
 The previous government did not try to understand anything about the cities and kept making plans for indiscriminate construction, implementing the plans
 infrastracchar yani nirmaan mahatvapurn hota he, telecom, yaa internet communication, transport or construction main naveenatam technology kaa prayog bhi jaruri he, lekin ye akele smart city kaa nirmaan nahin kar sakate
 The biggest difference is in the services provided in cities — drainage, waste management, public transport, law and order, traffic control are important factors but the government will have to overcome a major hurdle to improve them
 infrastracchar yani buniyadi dhaancha khadaa karnaa aasaan he lekin stareey sevaayen uplabdhi karwaanaa kahin kathin hota he
 Recall how the service system had improved in the days of Emergency, something similar is being adopted today but its benefits are not permanent
 aaj adhikansh shaharon main uplabdh sevaaon kaa str kaaphi ghatiya he, isaki vajah yah he ki sevaayen uplabdh karwaane vaale us kshetra ke chune gaye pratinidhiyon ke prati jaraa bhi javabdeh nahin hai
 Power in large cities can be commanded by bureaucrats, municipal commissioners who are ultimately accountable to the chief minister, which is why all public services around the chief minister's residence in all states are very well maintained and standard
 to iskaa samaadhaan yah he ki shahar phir janata ko saunp die jaaen
 The city mayor should be elected by the people of that city, who are directly accountable to the public
 loktantric prakriya se hi yah tay ho ki karadhaan kaisaa ho, rajasav kaa bantwaaraa kis tarah kiya jaae or har shahar ke swaroop kii kalpana kisi ho
 The municipal commissioner should take instructions from the mayor instead of the chief minister
 lekin desh ke lagbhag 8,000 shaharon ke mahagauron ko adhik adhikaron se las karnaa hoga or bada vijan dena hoga
 The term 'smart city' has to be shaped so that people can strive for it
 to iskaa moolmantra kya hona chahie?pradhanmantri narendra modi sawarjanik sthalon ke mahatv ko samajhate hai
 The banks of the Sabarmati river or the ghats of Varanasi are not places of entertainment or recreation, they bring people along
 bazaar bhi aisi jagah he, jahaan kai tarah ke log jutate hai lekin dilli main sarkaar bade niojit tareeke se saptahik haat or asangathit bazaaron ko khatm kar rahi he, uski jagah bade mal khulte ja rahe hai, jahaan sirf samrudh log hi ja sakate hai
 Connectivity also means easing traffic in the city
 aazaadee se pehle british sarkaar ne bade shaharon—bombai, kalakatta or madras main chaude footpath banaae the lekin aazaadee ke baad hamaare siyaasi aakaaon ko yaad hi nahin rahaa ki sadakon ke kinare paidal yatriyon ko bhi chalanaa hota he
 Another factor of the advanced city is also the diversity of the population, with London and New York being examples of how economic and intellectual prosperity flows seamlessly through the spontaneous interaction of people from different backgrounds
 bharat kaa udhaaharan len
 When the non-bengalis started leaving Kolkata, the city collapsed, people from other states came to Mumbai, then the city started to grow, after the partition of refugees after the arrival of Delhi, the nature of Delhi first deteriorated, then it started
 bangaloru main duusare rajyon se logon kaa aana shuru hua to isaki vikaas kii gaadi bhi chal nikali
 But we still have a lot to do
 paraspar sampark or vividhta tabhi kargar hogi jab bhartiya shahar garibon ko bhi paryaapt sthaan den
 No, do not place them in illegal slums, nor in extremely high-altitude people; As some states propose, rather put a place where their children can play freely, women can walk without fear, there is an open space, which is in the eyes of mothers and police
 modi ke ‘smart city’ kaa yahi moolmantra ho saktaa he
 a city that welcomes the poor with open arms

 ) CM Amarinder Singh accuses Shiromani Akali Dal of politicizing 550th Prakash Parv celebrations
punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday alleged that Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is politicizing the 550th Prakash Parv celebrations of Shri Guru Nanak Dev
 Is hindering unhone kaha ki is aitihaasik sanyukt samaaroh main shaamil hone ke liye punjab ke saansadon, vidhayakon or mantriyon ko nankana sahib jane ke liye vija or anumati nahin di ja rahi he
 What is the whole matter? While informally speaking to media persons during the review of the management of the event, the Chief Minister said that this is an occasion of pride, which his government wanted to celebrate as a joint celebration, rising above politics
 lekin shiromani akali dal or khaskar kendriya mantri harsimrat cor badal ne rajya sarkaar ke prayaason ko naakaam karne kaa bharpoor prayaas kiya he jo ki vishuddh ochhaapan he
 Referring to the spending of Rs 550 crore by the Punjab government for the ceremony, Amarinder said that the Akali Dal, along with its ally BJP, has turned this whole occasion into a spectacle
 captain amarinder ne apane mantriyon or punjab ke pratinidhiyon ko pakistan ke gurudwara nankana sahib jane kii anumati na dene ko durbhagyapurna qaraar diya
 He said that politics should be excluded on this religious occasion
 unhone yah bhi doharaaya ki coridor se jane vaale tirthayatriyon par 20 dollar kii fees waapas na lene ke pakistan ke faisle kaa ve virodh jari rakhenge
 Central Government's claim? He appealed to the Government of Pakistan to keep its heart big in view of the sentiments and traditions of the Sikh community
 yah poochne par ki kya punjab sarkaar tirthayatriyon kii taraf se fees kii yah rakam bharne ko taiyaar he, amarinder ne kaha ki ve siddhantat: pakistan ko kuch bhi dene ke khilaaf the
 Responding to a question, the Captain said that the Central Government's claim that a large part of the expenditure of the 550th Prakash Parshv projects is being given by the Center
 centre ne sirf pariyojnaon ke liye paisa diya he or isamen se ek main centre ne aanshik yogadan diya he
 He said that the state government has already spent 550 crores in it and will continue to spend on various programs and infrastructure development
 is masale par raajnneeti karne ke harsimrat ke aaropon se inkaar karte hue mukhyamantri ne kaha ki yah sikh samudaay or punjab ke liye gaurav kaa vishay he ki jab shraddhaluon kaa pehla jattha kartarpur coridor se gujaregaa to bharat ke uparashtrapati bhi 9 november ko kartarpur sahib ja rahe hai

 unhone kaha tha, agar police ke kaam karne ke tareekon main ham badlaav nahin kar paaenge to adarsh police kaa sapana hameshaa sapana hi rahegaa
 Singh also wrote that it is necessary for the police not to do justice under any assumption or bias
 is course ko banane ke liye samajashastri or manovaigyanikon ko bhi shaamil karne kii baat is letters main likhi gai thi
 Like after the murder of Vivek Tiwari, the UP police is saying to give training for behavior improvement
 The same training was discussed in the case of rape of a minor in Badaun police station
 us vakt ke disipi sharma ne kaha tha, 'police ke kharaab bartaav kii shikaayatein lagaataar aa rahi hai
 'in such a situation, a training program will be started to improve the behavior of the police
 sawaal ye uthta he ki ye sudhaar kaarykram kaa khyaal aakhir kisi ghatana ke baad hi kyon police prashasan ke man main aata he? ek police ke sipaahi ke maanviya adhikaron ko lekar bhi samay-samay par sawaal uthte rahe hai
 Improvement needs have also been raised from time to time regarding their holidays and allowances
 lekin un sabhi siforeeshon kaa sangyaan ab tak nahin liya gaya
 Training to improve police behavior is very good
 lekin is khyaal ko vaaki main tabhi hakeekat main utaara ja sakegaa jab is bartaav ke peeche chhipe kaarnon ke manovaigyanik or saamaajik kaarnon kii gaharaai se padtaal ho
 What kind of pressure are there on the police
 tanaav bhare maahaul main kaam karne ke baad ve us par niyantran kaise karte hai

 adhikariyon ne yah jaankaree di
 It is one of the most horrific attacks in the history of Sri Lanka
 police pravaktaa ruvan gunasekhara ne bataaya ki ye dhamaake sthaneey samyaanusaar aath bajkar 45 minute par easter prarthana sabha ke dauraan colombo ke saint anthony, pashchimi tateey shahar negambo ke saint sebastian carch or batticalova ke ek carch main hue
 Three other explosions occurred at five-star hotels - Shangrila, The Cinnamon Grand and The Kingsbury
 hotel main hue visphot main ghayal videshi or sthaneey logon ko colombo general hospital main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 On the other hand, Gulf News has reported in a report that the Sri Lankan police chief gave intelligence input of a major attack 10 days ago
 input main kaha gaya tha ki fidaayin hamalavar desh ke pramukh charchon ko nishaanaa bana sakate hai
 Gulf News has published this report quoting AFP
 police pramukh pujuth jaisundar ne 11 april ko desh ke aalaa police adhikariyon ko input bheja tha jisamen hamale ke prati aagaah karne kii baat kahi gai thi
 The Intelligence Alert also added input from a foreign intelligence agency and stated that an organization called the National Tauhit Jamaat (NTJ) is looking to target some of Sri Lankan churches
 is sanghathan ke nishane par colombo main bhartiya ucchayukta bhi tha
 Such information was given in the input
 gauratlab he ki jis antije kaa naam srilanka ke dhamaake main uchhla he, vah kattarpanthi muslim sanghathan he
 The organization also came into limelight last year when some Buddhist shrines were attacked there
 haalanki is hamale kii jimmedaari abhi tak kisi ne nahin lee he
 On the other hand, sources in the Sri Lankan hospital said that so far 156 people have died in these blasts
 unhone bataaya ki colombo main 42, negambo main 60 or batticalova main 27 logon kii maut ho gai
 Colombo National Hospital spokesperson Dr Samindi Samarakoon said that more than 300 people have been admitted to the hospital
 aarthik sudhaar or lok vitaran mantri harsh di silva ne kaha, ‘videshi logon samet kai log maare gaye hai
 'no one has claimed responsibility for this attack yet
 srilanka main purv main littey (altitii) ne kai hamale kiye hai

 'A minister said that the Sri Lankan government has called an emergency meeting

 Harsha Di Silva said, 'very frightening scene, i saw people's body parts scattered around

 Indian citizens can call on these numbers for any help and help and clarification- +94777903082, +94112422788, +94112422789
 ’ It is to be noted that the petition filed by DDCA said that illegal construction done before 2011 has been regularized under the NCT Special Provisions Act
 isliye is block ko yahaan hone vaale cricket match ke liye prayog karne kii anumati di jaae
 However the Delhi government opposed it
 esadmasi ne hai court ko bataaya tha ki firozshah kotla maidan main tii-20 world cap kaa match karwaane ke liye unhone didisie ko certificate jari kar diya he
 But this certificate is not for the use of RP Mehra block because this block has been constructed illegally
 congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne ek baar phir narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Digvijay has tweeted that he is hopeful that now Modi will call Chandrashekhar Azad and Bhagat Singh as campaigners of the Sangh and claim that the independence union got India
 saath hi digvijay singh ne yah bhi likhaa he ki narendra modi sardaar patel kii viraasat ko hijank karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 So what is it to assume that they are betraying the union leaders like Golwalkar, Deendayal Upadhyay and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee? However, the latest statement by Digvijay Singh shows that the battle between the political lords is getting faster by the day

 Bal Thackeray Birth Anniversary: who had thought of Bal Thackeray as ever being a cartoonist and a politician who was accused of breaking the law many times
 lekin phir bhi thakare bolte rahe, unhen kisi kaa dar nahin tha
 This identity was his specialty
 babari vidhwans se lekar uttar bharatiyon par hamalon ke aarope ke baavjood thakare maharashtra main satta ke centre bindu bane rahe
 Let's know these special things related to him on his birth anniversary today
 
 Bal Thackeray was born in a Marathi family on 23 January 1926 in Pune, then Bombay Residency
 unka asal naam bal keshav thakare he
 He is also known by the name of Balasaheb Thackeray and Hindu Hriday Samrat
 bataa den, 9 bhai-bahanon main bal thakare sabase bade the
 Bal Thackeray also formed a political party called Shiv Sena
 unki party kii maharashtra main acchhee pakad he or bahari logon ke virodh ke kaaran unhen zyada pahchaan mili
 His career started like this: Bal Thackeray was a good cartoonist, who made his mark in Maharashtra
 unhone apane kariyar kii shuruyaat mumbai ke ek angreji dainik 'da free press jarnal' ke saath bataur cartoonist kii
 In 1960, Bal Thackeray quit his job as a cartoonist
 jiske baad apana raajnneetik saptahik akhbaar maarmik nikaala
 Let me tell you, Bal Thackeray's cartoons were printed every Sunday in 'times of India'
 pita se hue preritabal thakare kaa raajnneetik darshan unke pita se prabhavit tha
 His father Keshav Sitaram Thackeray was a well-known face of the 'united Maharashtra Movement'
 unke pita keshav seetaram thakare ne bhashaayi aadhaar par maharashtra rajya ke nirmaan main mahatvapurn yogadan diya tha
 Bal Thackeray was the founder of Shiv Sena mouthpiece Marathi newspaper 'saamana' and Hindi newspaper 'noon Ka Saamna'
 pariwarbal thakare kii patni kaa naam minaa thakare tha, saal 1995 main unki mrityu ho gai thi
 He has three sons, the late Bindumadhav, Jaidev and Uddhav Thackeray
 bataa den, unke bade bete bindhumadhav thakare kii ek sadak durghatana main 20 april 1996 ko mumbai-pune hive par maut ho gai thi
 When the Shiv Sena was formed in 1966, Bal Thackeray formed the political party 'shiv Sena' for the rights of the people of Maharashtra on the political and business landscape of Mumbai
 shuruaati dinon se hi shivasena kii raajnneeti vivaad kaa centre rahi
 Even the ruling parties were afraid of him
 shivasena kaa shabdic arth 'shiv kii sena' he
 Shiva means the great Maratha Shivaji
 in dinon bal thakare ke bete uddhav thakare party kii kaman sambhaal rahe hai
 Even after the formation of Shiv Sena, the main objective of the party was to ensure work for the Marathi people from South Indian people, Gujaratis and Marwaris
 apane hinduvadi agenda kaa saathi shivasena ko bijepi ke rup main mila or donon ne milakar 1995 main maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav jeeta
 Let me tell you, Bal Thackeray always kept fighting for the Marathi manoos
 unhone mumbai par marathiyon kaa pehla adhikaar bataate hue bahari logon ko yahaan se khadedane kii aawaaj uthaai
 Let me tell you, due to illness, Bal Thackeray had distanced himself from the daily work of the party for some time
 nahin ladaa kabhi chunaavamayanagari mumbai ko apana garh banaakar kaam karne vaale bal thakare ne na to kabhi koi chunaav ladaa, na hi koi raajnneetik pad sweekaar kiya
 Despite this, he continued to play an important role in the politics of Maharashtra
 jab laga 6 saal tak bain28 july 1999 ko bal thakare par chunaav ayog kii sifarish par 6 saal ke liye vot na daalane or chunaav na ladane kaa bain laga diya gaya tha
 The ban on him was lifted in 2005 and he then voted for the BMC election in 2006 for the first time
 bataa den, dharm ke naam par vot maangane ke aarope main unhen bain kar diya gaya tha
 When i met Michael Jackson In 1996, pop star Michael Jackson came to Mumbai for a concert and was warmly received by the Shiv Sena
 maaikel jackson bal thakare ke ghar gaye or kaha jaataa he ki unhone us toilet seat par autograph bhi diya, jiskaa unhone istemaal kiya tha
 The death of November 17, 2012 was the day when a wave of mourning spread throughout the country including Mumbai
 86 saal ke thakare kaa nidhan mumbai main unke nivas matoshri main dopaher kareeb saadhe teen baje hua tha
 (the funeral took place at Shivaji Park) According to doctors, Thackeray died of a heart attack
 mayanagari mumbai ko apana garh banaakar kaam karne vaale bal thakare apane vivaadit bayanon kii vajah se aksar surkhiyaan batorte rahe hai
 
 
 Today is the birth anniversary of famous Hindi writer, poet Ramdhari Singh 'dinkar'
 unka janm aaj hi ke roj 23 sitambar, 1908 bihar main hua tha
 Dinkar is established as the poet of the best heroic rasa of the modern era
 unki kavitaaon ne aazaadee kii ladaai main logon ko jaagruk kiya
 Ramdhari Singh Dinkar was one of such poets
 jinaki kavitaayen kisi anpadh kisaan ko bhi utani hi pasand he jitani ki un par research karne vaale scollar ko bhi
 Dinkar was born on 23 September 1908 in Simaria village in Begusarai district, Bihar
 teen saal kii umr main sir se pita kaa saaya uth jane ke kaaran unka bachapan abhaavon main beetaa
 But the daily recitation of Ramcharitmanas at home sowed the seeds of poetry and his understanding within Dinkar

 Taki Hassan, a 33-year-old Lucknow resident, works as an electrician by profession
 taki apane sapanom ko puraa karne ke liye videsh gaya tha
 After suffering an accident, Taki came to know that there was a tumor in the forehead above his right eye
 lihaaja apana ilaaj karaane ke liye wo vatan laut aayaa
 After this, as if Taki's dreams were broken one by one
 baar-baar laut aata tumorbimari kii vajah se taki shaareerik kamajori ke saath-saath bhaavnaatmak rup se bhi kamjor padana laga
 And the reason for this was that serious illness, which was returning to Taki's life repeatedly, not one or two but even after four surgeries
 taki hasan ke mutabik, ek-do nahin chaar-chaar baar surgery hone ke baavjood 10-15 dinon baad hi taki ke sir main phir se dard shuru ho jaataa
 The disease was like cancer, slowly the weight of taki started falling
 shaareerik kamajori ke saath-saath taki bhaavnaatmak rup se kamjor ho gaya
 Economic conditions were also becoming crispy
 darasal taki head sarchoma beemaari se grasit tha
 According to experts, this disease is a type of cancer, due to which a tumor was emerging on Taki's forehead repeatedly
 chaar-chaar surgery ke baavjood ye gambhir beemaari taki kaa peechha nahin chhod rahi thi or cese bigadataa ja rahaa tha
 In the absence of survival, this infection of cancer slowly reached Taki's right eye and Taki had to lose one of his eyes
 head, nek and breast onkoplasty vibhaag, fortis hospital ke pramukh dow mandeep malhotra ne bataaya ki jab taki aspataal main aayaa to uski haalat bahut najuk thi
 Almost one eye was gone and the infection slowly reached the brain
 tumor orbit teji se chehre par fail rahaa tha
 In the circumstances under which Hassan reached Fortis, the chances of survival of such patients are very less
 jaankaron ke mutabik aise keson main 30 fisadi log infections kii vajah se lambey samay tak beemaari se jujhte rahete hai
 The condition of the huge financial help from social media was so bad that the infection was reaching his other eye and brain and he did not have the money to get treatment in a private and big hospital
 lihaaja taki ke parivaar waalon ko soojha ki soshal media se madad maangi jaae
 What was it then, through Facebook and whatsapp, Taki's relatives pleaded for help, and upon seeing this, money was also arranged with blessings from the Sikh and Muslim communities of Australia and America
 soshal media kii madad se taki ke parivaar waalon ko kareeb 8 lakh rupee mili jisase vasant kunj fortis aspataal main taki hasan kaa jatil oparation sambhav hua
 It was not easy to arrange the money for the operation of the operation, but the operation was not so easy as it was the first case of its kind, in which the right side skull was completely damaged and recovering the patient's life
 Saving was also a challenge for doctors
 16 ghante tak chale is oparation main marij ke chehre ko qamar kii skin se dobaaraa banaaya gaya
 And Taki Hasan won this battle of death because he had the blessings of the people and says that when the above is with him, death is also afraid of coming

 In the subject of art, questions will be asked on social status, problems and solutions rather than traditional questions

 For the first time, subjects like agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry and environment are also being added to the administrative service selection
 iees pariksha kii tarah samanta laane ke liye taarkik shakti jaise prashnon kaa samavesh kiya ja rahaa he
 Questions of Rajasthani literature and dialects are also being included in the subjects of language

 TV actor Harshad Chopra, known for his romantic image, will be seen in a new avatar
 vah imagin tivi ke kaarykram 'dharmapatni' main apni chhavi se hatakar kirdaar nibhaane ja rahe hai
 Excerpts from the conversation he had with this question
 
 
 apane aane vaale sho 'dharmapatni' ke bare main kuch bataaie
 
 
 It is such that we make a lot of romantic shows, dramas, thrillers and so on, but 'dharmapatni' is different
 yah ek sakaaratmak sho he, jisamen yuvaaon ke liye praasangik ek saamaajik sandesh bhi he
 The premise of 'godfather' is the idea that behind every successful person there is a strong woman
 
 
 'dharmapatni' ke liye haa kehane kii vajah kya rahi, uski kahani yaa diarector
 
 
 The i have always said yes to different roles from previous characters
 ise quality, sankalp or kathanak ke maamle main meri pasand kaa hona chahie
 The 'wife' is overall encouraging
 main nahin jaanata ki darshak is sho ko yaa mere charitra ko kis rup main lenge, lekin main 'dharmapatni' se judaa rahoonga or isse mujhe khushi hogi
 
 
 How different your role in 'dharmapatni' is from the previous characters
 
 
 ? 'dharmapatni' main mohan kaa charitra gandhi ke jivan par aadhaarit nahin he, or ise khule dimag se dekhne kii jarurat he
 Many times we sit mimicking the wrong things of our society and we get disappointed when the events are not interesting
 mohan kaa charitra ek aise aadmi kaa he, jo apane aas-paas kii chizon se niraash ho chukaa he or in sabase kaaphi dur rahanaa chahta he, or isi kaaran vah bhatak jaataa he
 This character reveals that every human being is basically good, but circumstances make it good or bad
 
 
 sho main aapane asia kaaji ke saath kaam kiya he, unke saath kaam kaa anubhav kaisaa rahaa
 
 
 ? i knew only Supriya ji from the beginning with the artists i am working with in 'dharmapatni'
 jahaan tak asia kii baat he, main unke saath pehali baar kaam kar rahaa hum, lekin hamaara aamanaa-saamana pehle bhi ho chukaa he or hamane aapas main hansi-majaak kiya he
 i am sure of good chemistry and great experience on screen with them
 
 
 sunne main aayaa he ki aapse pehle abhishek ravat ko is bhoomika ke liye chunaa gaya tha
 
 
 The The only thing i can say about this is that i was worthy of this role and i hope the audience too likes me in the role of Mohan
 
 
 haal hi main friendship de par aapane kya special kiya
 
 
 a Friendship Day message to his fans
 
 
 ? apane doston ke liye aapke sabhi dinon main friendship de ek khaas din hota he
 
 
 Sometimes we are not able to meet each other for weeks, but whenever we talk among ourselves, the same attachment in the voice remains intact
 dosti kaa asli matlab yah he ki is rishte ko ek din manaaya jaae or lagaataar sampark nahin rahane par bhi unhen yaad rakhen, chaahe vah koi bhi ho
 Friendship Day for me is a day to thank friends for being special to themselves
 
 
 main apane sabhi prashansakon ko friendship de kii mubaarakabaad detaa hum or dua karata hum ki aap sabhi is rang-birange bandhan kii khushiyaan manaaen

 uttar pradesh ke siyaasi ran main congress ko bhale hi samaajawaadee party va bahujan samaaj party ke gathbandhan main jagah na mili ho, lekin jin siton par in dalon ke paariwarik netaa chunaav main utar rahe hai, vahaan sab ek-duusare par meharbaan najar aa rahe hai
 Now Congress has decided not to field its candidates for 6 such seats
 isse pehle basapa adhyaksh mayawati ke saath gathbandhan kii ghoshnaa karte hue sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne raibareli va amethi seat congress ko dene kii baat kahi thi or in siton par gathbandhan kaa ummidavaar na utaarne kaa nirnay liya tha
 On the question of alliance with Congress, Akhilesh Yadav has been consistently saying that Congress has been given two seats, which are the constituencies of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
 11 ummidavaaron kii pehali list jari kar chuki congress ne bhi bada dil dikhaaya he
 The Congress has decided not to contest on 6 such seats, where Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati will contest the elections themselves or will contest any election from their family
 in siton par congress nahin utaaregi pratyaashee!mana ja rahaa he ki ab congress party ne mainpuri, firozabad, kannauj or azamgarh seat khaali chhodane kaa faisla kiya he
 Apart from these four seats, if Mayawati fights from any place, no candidate will be fielded in that seat
 bataa den ki mainpuri se mulaayam singh yadav, kannauj se akhilesh yadav kii patni dimple yadav or firozabad se ramgopal yadav ke bete akshay yadav chunaav ladane ja rahe hai
 There is talk of Akhilesh Yadav fighting from Azamgarh seat
 jabaki mayawati ne abhi sthiti spasht nahin kii he
 The Congress has decided the name of the candidate from Badaun seat in its first list
 dilachasp baat ye he ki is seat se philhal akhilesh yadav ke parivaar se dharmendra yadav saansad hai
 In such a situation, there is now a thought to remove the Congress candidate from this seat
 majboot siton par baatcheet kii jugat main congressspa-basapa parivaar ke liye bada dikhaate hue congress is baat kii bhi sambhaavnaaen talash rahi he ki jahaan uski sthiti jeetne vaali ban sakati he, vahaan sapa-basapa ke samarthan kii koi surat ban jaae
 The attitude with which the Congress had moved ahead by putting Priyanka Gandhi in UP, at the moment they seem to be softening
 gathbandhan par punarvichaar ke sawaal par akhilesh ne ye kahkar bhi viraam laga diya he ki ab vakt nahin bachaa he, dobaaraa se gathbandhan ke liye mej nahin sajaai ja sakati
 In such a situation, the SP-BSP and the Congress, while fighting separately, are seen running on a plan to enter the electoral battle against the BJP with an internal consensus

 yahi nahin police ko shaq naa ho isliye apana hissaa lene jate samay raju apni patni ko saath lekar jaataa tha
 Delhi Police is hopeful that Delhi will get a big relief from the arrest of Raju Hakale

 Some of his old experts told that he lived a very fun life before becoming a saint
 diksha lene se pehle shanti sagar madhya pradesh ke guna main rahata tha
 When the news of Shanti Sagar's misdeeds came to his knowledge, everyone was shocked

 During the election campaign, the Congress General Secretary told on Thursday that he received a notice from the National Commission for the Rights of the Child, when he raised slogans against Priyanka Gandhi in front of Priyanka Gandhi
 sawaalon ke jawaab dete hue priyanka gandhi (priyanka Gandhi) ne kaha, 'bachche khel rahe the, mai utari unase milane ke liye, unhone kuch naare lagaae
 As soon as they chanted the wrong slogans, i stopped them and said, son, these people should not raise good slogans

 It is being shown by wrong editing

 Farmers and employment are also issues

 At the same time, responding to the condition of making Mayawati the PM in the post-poll alliance, Priyanka Gandhi said that these decisions will be decided by the national level leaders

 Along with the information of the names, addresses of those children, they have also been asked where the sloganeering took place and how the children reached there

 kuch aisa hi hua paanch saal ke afghanistan ke murtaza ahmadi ke saath
 You must have known this child
 akhbaar ke pannon se lekar, television channels or duniya bhar main ye baccha internet senceshan bana
 And the reason behind this was the photo of Murtaza in a T-shirt worn by Argentine blue stripes on a plastic bag with the number 10 written on it
 
 
 jo mesi kaa jersey number he
 Argentine star footballer Lionel Messi then presented Murtaza with his autographed T-shirt, and the subsequent uproar began, causing Murtaza's entire family to leave Afghanistan
 murtaza ke pita mohammad aarif ahmadi kehete hai ki hamen phone par dhamkiyaan milin
 We also received threatening letters, so we had to leave Afghanistan
 khat pashto main likhaa tha or mujhe wo zyada samaj nahin aati
 It wrote that Mohammed Arif and Khalifa Arif should be punished wherever they appear
 tippaniyan In fact, Murtaza's father feared that his child would be kidnapped, for which he also received threatening phone calls and letters

 The letter was written in Pashto and i do not understand that much
 usamen likhaa tha ki mohammad aarif or khaliph aarif jahaan dikhen unhen or unke parivaar ko sazaa do
 The comments darasal, murtaza ke pita ko dar tha ki unke bachche kaa apharan kar liya jayega, jiske liye unhen dhamkee bhare phone kol or khat bhi mili
 Their number grew so much day by day that Murtaza's father had to leave his country and settle in Pakistan

 The Afghan Soccer Federation promised that they would meet Messi and child Murtaza Ahmadi soon

 Social activist and former Congress leader Nafisa Ali will be the Samajwadi Party candidate from Lucknow
 pehle party sanjay dutt ko tikat dena chaahati thi, lekin supreme court ne unhen chunaav ladane kii ijaajat nahin di thi
 The party then decided to give tickets to Nafisa Ali
 ek samvaadadaata sammelan main sapa ke mahasachiv amar singh ne isaki ghoshnaa kii
 Nafisa Ali and Sanjay Dutt were also present at the press conference
 amar singh ne kaha ki nafisa ali ke saath samaajawaadee party ke puraane or kareebi rishte hai
 Sanjay Dutt said that Nafisa is like his sister
 kolkata main janmin nafisa 2004 main dakshin kolkata seat par mamata banerjee ke khilaaf congress ke tikat par chunaav lard chuki hai
 However, after Sanjay Dutt, there was also speculation about his wife Manyata Dutt being made the candidate of the Samajwadi Party
 nafisa ali kaa muqabla congress se bispi main gaye akhilesh das or bijepi ke lalji tandon ke saath he
 The fun of assessing elections is probably not by seeing or speaking
 chowk-chaubaare par log kya baaten kar rahe hai, yah sunne kaa agar dhiraj he to aap chunaav kii alag hi tasviir dekh paaenge
 Now when people turn on the TV camera, people speak less of their mind, more to see
 koi samarthak nikal aayaa to jor-jor se apni party yaa netaa kaa hi naam lene lagegaa
 But when the voter is in his solitude, when he is between two-three people and talking, then his words should be heard
 iskaa saubhaahgya tivi ankaron ko kam hi miltaa he, phir bhi aap sunanaa chahen to anjaan bane rahakar sun sakate hai
 Provided that they themselves do not suffer from the disease of speech
 kuch din pehle landan skool of iconomix kii mukulika banerjee kii kitaab 'vaai india vots?' pard rahaa tha
 Mukulika explores why people vote
 un tatwon kii pahchaan kii he jisase ek matadaata banataa he
 How a voter considers this identity to be the most valuable than the other identity
 vah pahchaan patr ko is kadar sambhaal kar rakhata he, jaise parivaar main zevar rakhaa jaataa he
 In the shadow of this book, this time i roamed the streets of Delhi and started listening to the words of people
 poocha kam, suna zyada
 This election has given excellent opportunities to understand democracy
 hindustan kaa matadaata apni sarkaron ke bare main kis tarah se sochataa he, uskaa ek or paripakv udhaaharan dilli chunaav ke nattejey se milane ja rahaa he
 During this time i heard many reasons to vote, but the main reason was to have a strong voice
 kai matadaataaon ne is ek kami ko sabase upar rekhaankit kiya
 This includes everything from a doctor to a fruit seller
 har tabake ke logon ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav ke baad vipaksh kii awaz khatm ho gai he
 The Prime Minister does not raise any voice in front of Narendra Modi
 maine poocha bhi ki aap to yahi chaahate the ki majboot or damdaar netritv ho
 People responded that this is what we wanted, but we did not want the opposition to be heard
 compatishan na ho
 This is not good for democracy
 saadhaaran se saadhaaran matadaata ke is vivek ne mujhe loktantr main lok kii bhoomika kaa aisa paath padhaayaa, jise main tivi studio kii bahes se nahin jaan paata
 After the formation of the government in May 2014, it was an important part of the speech of every big BJP leader that there is no opposition in the country
 netaa vipaksh tak nahin he
 Even in Delhi elections, Amit Shah would have said that the opposition has received such a severe punishment
 janata bijepi ke in bayanon ko apane tareeke se bhaanp rahi thi
 He felt on many occasions that the voice of the opposition was not good, so he started looking towards the parties to fill that gap
 congress ke paas mauka tha, magar vah dhili pad gai
 No other party took this initiative
 akhilesh yadav yaa nitish kumaar ne vipaksh banane main waisi sakriyata nahin dikhaai, jisaki ummid kii ja rahi thi
 Mayawati criticized the routine press conference but there was no opposition on the road
 ek kaaran yah bhi tha ki inke paas dilli main vipaksh banane kii koi sankhya nahin thi
 Congress leader Rahul Gandhi walked out in the last days of the election but delayed
 vipaksh kii bhoomika ko road sho kii aupchaarikta se nipta diya
 Everywhere, common people said that if there is no competition then only one man will be arbitrary
 sabzi bechney vaale ek shaks ne kaha ki awaz to uthaanaa chahie na
 We have no complaint with the Prime Minister
 vah acha kaam kar rahe hai, phir bhi awaz uthaane vaala koi to hona chahie
 When asked why, he answers that how will we know that what the government is saying is correct
 doosraa mat to pataa hi nahin chalegaa
 i had no idea that our voter would understand this basic need of democracy
 koi padhaa likhaa professor yah baat kahata to main hairaan nahin hota, lekin hotel ke waiter se lekar taxi dryver tak is chunaav ke zariye vipaksh kii ek awaz dhundh rahe the
 a woman complaining about not having toilets said that if one is raising a voice, it is known that the government is doing right or wrong
 yani public sirf sarkaar kaa mat nahin jaananaa chaahati
 She wants to join the Opposition's vote before she trusts the government
 main jitne logon se miltaa, baaten karata unke munh se yah baat sunakar sar jhukta chalaa jaataa
 He had no particular complaint, no anger with Narendra Modi, but these people were looking for a voice through the Delhi elections, which could become the voice of opposition in the country
 logon ko lag rahaa tha ki bijepi ko koi roak nahin paa rahaa he
 No one is able to ask the BJP
 bijepi ko baad main vichaar karne kaa mauka milegaa ki janata aakhir kyon aisa sochane lagi
 Many people even asked whether it is right that the media is not independent
 ek buudhe vyakti ne kaha ki ham to bijepi ke voter hai, lekin aap sawaal kiijie
 Ask tough questions
 desh main awaz kyon nahin he
 In many places, people said that there should be a competition between two governments
 ham dekhnaa chaahate hai ki koun acha kaam karata he or koun nahin
 Despite this, it was also heard that there will be more development if there is a single party government in the center and the state
 yah line bhi khub pramukhataa se sunai padi
 People met talking that if there is a government of the central party in Delhi, the conflict will be less
 yojanaayen jaldi paas hongi or lagu hongi
 On the basis of this voice, the confidence of being a thorn in the Delhi elections went on
 is chunaav main dilli kaa matadaata dilli ke liye sarkaar or us dilli ke liye awaz khojane kii kashmakash se guzar rahaa tha, jahaan se hindustan kii hukumat chalati he
 Whatever the results of the survey and exit poll came, but many parties failed to listen to the mind of the voters of Delhi
 unke paas mauka tha ki is khaali jagah ko bharne kaa
 The Aam Aadmi Party took advantage of this
 ladaai main aakar usne daavedaari pesh kii ki uske paas awaz banane kaa saahas he
 The people who were looking for a strong leadership a year ago, now began to find a strong voice in front of that leadership
 logon ne dilli ke liye sarkaar banane kaa janadesh kam, vipaksh kii awaz ke liye zyada vot kiya he
 Sociologists and political scientists will evaluate the results of Delhi elections in many ways
 magar is chunaav ne matadaata ke ek nae charitra ko hamaare saamne rakhaa he
 Till a year ago, the voter who was doing modi-modi wholeheartedly, was now liking someone else without hating Modi
 ek saal pehle ke uske jajaane ke hisaab se aap kah sakate hai ki yah modi ke alaava kisi or ke bare main nahin sochega
 It has become a Modi devotee or a BJP voter
 yaad kiijie isi matadaata ke bare main kaha gaya ki yah arvind kejariwal or modi ko pasand karata he, magar loksabhaa main modi ko hi vot karegaa
 It happened
 lekin kya yah kamaal nahin he ki vahi matadaata palat kar apni duusari nishtha kii taraf mudata he, jiske kaaran aaj aam aadmi party ko sarkaar banane kii hode main aage bataaya ja rahaa he
 Such dual loyalty of the electorate is rarely seen
 vah bhi itane kam antaraal main
 i am not a consummate scholar of politics, but as a student, i saw it happening after a long time
 pehle hua hoga par apni smriti ke anusaar pehali baar ho rahaa he
 The same voter of the khata-peeta middle class, who goes to the wedding wearing a strangled necklace and pulls a selfie from Samsung's mobile, saying that he had voted for Modi at the Center, Kejriwal in the state
 is matadaata kii dohari nishtha main sampradayikta ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 He listens to the unrestrained teachings in the name of culture and moral education, but knows that his future cannot be secured by such politics
 vah aaraam se dharmik pahchaan dhaaran karata he, magar iske naam par sampradayikta bardaasht nahin karata
 If he hates the fraud of secular politics, he is also irritated by the intentions of communal politics
 yah matadaata koun he? yahi vah matadaata he jo secular he, jise samaajawaadee party yaa congress party kii sicular (biimaar) raajnneeti se chidh he, magar yah samajhnaa ki isiilie vah sampradayik he aap galati kar rahe hai
 This voter class also does not recognize the communal statements of many BJP mps
 yah saaf-saaf samaj rahaa he ki dharm kii jagah kahin or he
 If politics will run on the issue of religion, then hindu-muslim debate will remain as a contest
 is dohari nishtha vaale matadaata kii nigaah kaam par he
 He wants to see a fight between several parties over work
 swasthy muqabla jisamen adhik se adhik janata kaa phayda ho
 The result of the Delhi elections came in the favor of anyone, but the factor of wanting a voice of a strong opposition cannot be ignored
 maine vahi likhaa he jo kuch hafton ke dauraan dilli ke logon ko baat karte suna he
 Please pay attention at the time of election
 koun kya kah rahaa he
 i only heard that the opposition should be strong and there should be a voice
 pashchim bengal main jahrili sharaab kii ghatnaayen rokane kii pahal karte hue mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki avaidh sharaab kaa kaarobaar karne vaale logon ko doosraa vyavsaay shuru karne main rajya sarkaar unhen madad degi
 After meeting with senior officials of the district, Mamta told reporters that a large number of people were killed due to drinking poisonous liquor
 ham chaahate hai ki avaidh sharaab kaa kaarobaar karne vaale log ise chhodkar anya vyavsaay shuru karen
 Mamta said that we will start a plan for this so that these people can have a social security
 ullekhneey he ki kuch dinon pehle dakshin 24 pargana jile ke sangrampur railway stesan ke sameep jahrili sharaab pine kii vajah se kam se kam 171 logon kii maut ho gai
 The BJP Parliamentary Party will meet in New Delhi on November 20 to discuss the strategy during the forthcoming winter session of Parliament on FDI in multibrand retail
 bijepi ke purv rashtriya adhyaksh venkaiya naidu ne kaha, ‘varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani kii adhyakshata main aagaamee 20 november ko bijepi ke sansadeey dal kii baithak hogi, jisamen multibrands khudara vyapaar main 51 fisadi epadiai ko centre dwaara di gayi anumati par apanaayi janevaali ranneeti par charchaa hogi
 He said the BJP would hold consultations with key constituents of the NDA to pressurize the UPA within the Parliament to withdraw its decision so that foreign companies are not allowed to open shops in the retail sector
 vamadalon dwaara sansad ke bheetar epadiai par bahes karaane or matdaan ke liye niyam 184 ke tahat diye gayi notice par puche gayi prashn ke jawaab main naidu ne kaha ki epadiai par bahes or matdaan kaa bijepi samarthan karti he lekin is sambandh main antim nirnay samuchit samay par liya jayega
 He said that all mainstream parties except Congress are opposed to FDI in the grocery sector
 isse paanch karod vyavsaayee berozegaar ho jaaenge
 The UPA government has come in a minority, so it does not have the right to take decisions that will have a wider impact on the people of the country
 naidu ne kaha ki trinmul congress dwaara centre se samarthan vaapasi ke baad samprag sarkaar alpamat main aa chuki he or ise kisi bhi maamle main apane nirnay ko sansad ke bheetar paarit karana chahie
 He alleged that the UPA had unilaterally decided on FDI in retail trade by not consulting its allies
 samprag ko samarthan kar rahe dalon sapa, dramuk or basapa ne epadiai ke virodh main beete dinon rashtravyapee band kaa aahwan kiya tha
 The senior BJP leader said that the UPA is retracting its promise
 tatkaaleen kendriya vitt mantri pranav mukherjee or vaanijya mantri kamalnath ne kaha tha ki epadiai ko hari jhandi dene se pehle sansad ko bharose main liya jayega
 Congress should answer why it has reversed its promise? Naidu alleged that the Congress is taking a hasty decision on FDI, while opposing it while in opposition
 centre ne 2-ji spectrum or koyala khadaan ghotaalaa par logon kaa dhyaan bantane ke liye khudara vyapaar main epadiai kii anumati di he
 This issue will be raised prominently in the upcoming parliamentary elections
 sibiai ke durupyog kii ore sanket karte hue bijepi netaa ne aarope lagaaya ki centre ne sapa or basapa ke kuch pramukh netaaon ke sir par talwaar lataka rakhi he
 The UPA is blatantly misusing the CBI to maintain support for the formation of the Center
 sibiai ne badi karrwai karte hue mumbai iskar vibhaag ke upayukta jaipal swami ko rishwat lene ke aarope main giraftaar kar liya he
 More people have been arrested along with the Income Tax Officer
 aarope 3 karod kii rishwat lene kaa he
 According to the CBI, he received a complaint that a bribe of Rs 3 crore has been demanded by the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, Mumbai in a tax assessment case
 tippaniyan Investigation also revealed that the accused Deputy Commissioner had asked both his associates to bring jewelery in exchange for money
 shikaayat milane ke baad jaal bichhaakar pehle ek shaks ko 3 karod kii rishwat lete hue range haathon pakadaa
 The bribe was being taken through 2 checks
 baad main iskar upayukta or duusare ek shaks ko bhi giraftaar kar liya gaya
 The CBI has conducted raids in 3 different places in the case
 baaki ke do aropiyon ke naam kamalesh shah or prathamesh he
 All three will be produced in court on Saturday and remand will be taken
 jaanch main ye bhi pataa chalaa ki aaropee upayukta ne apane donon saathiyon ko rupayon ke badale jevaraat laane ko kaha tha
 After receiving the complaint, he laid a trap and caught a person red handed taking a bribe of 3 crore
 rishwat 2 check ke jariye lee ja rahi thi
 Later the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax and another person were also arrested
 sibiai ne maamle main 3 alag-alag jagahon par chaape maari kii he
 The remaining two accused are named Kamlesh Shah and Prathamesh
 teenon ko shanivaar ko adaalat main pesh kar remand lee jaaegi

 vah hameshaa se jujharu thi
 The victim of the Delhi gang rape not only showed her bravery in the bus on the night of 16 December by resisting her life to save herself, she used to fight a new battle everyday even in her short life
 usne garibi ke khilaaf jang kii or apane ird-gird kii tamaam baadhaon se loha liya
 She was trying her best to come out of hardships and breathe fresh air
 usne har us maukey ko hathiyaane kii khatir jaddojahad kii jo use or uske parivaar ko nimna madhyam varg ke daayre se baahar nikaalkar behatar jindagi kii ore le jaae
 This is the reason why this 23-year-old girl did not attend when her friends would gather to chat so that she could prepare to teach tuition to the children of the neighborhood
 usne kishoravastha se hi tution padhaane kii shuruyaat kar di thi or use is umr hi main tution padhgaye vaale bacchon kii ore se kaaphi sammaan bhi milane laga tha
 Some wanted to become physiotherapists just like him
 in bacchon ke mata-pita unase aksar kehete the, ‘‘ve tabhi kaamyaab honge, jab ve apni didi kii tarah kadi mehnat karenge
 "this 40-year-old area of south-west Delhi was once named 'mirzapur village', for that area this girl was always a hero
 uske kuch sapane 25 gaj ke uske chote-se makaan ke hisaab se kaaphi bade hua karte the
 His family had built a room for him so that he could feather his dreams
 uske pita kehete hai, “meri beti meraa haath chuumati or vaada kiya karti thi ki ek din vah hamaari jindagi badal daalegi
 This girl, who lived as her first child, her savior and her strength, had illuminated the small house of two rooms with the light of her hopes
 uske pita bhi apni beti ke khwaabon ko puraa karne ke liye kuch bhi karne ko taiyaar rahete the
 In one corner of her house, she would indulge in her books and help her two younger brothers study, then go to the neighborhood to teach tuition
 uski ek saheli aage bataati he, “vah padhai chhootane ke vichaar se dar jaati thi or pareshaan ho jaati thi
 "she recalls how both of them talked about the 'bright future' while cycling to a government school in West Delhi
 use apane pita se takat milti thi, jo din main airport par saamaan chadhaane or raat main sicurity guard kii duty karke roj do shift main kaam karte the
 She was pursuing a physiotherapy course from an institute in Dehradun and was soon to complete her studies
 vah dilli main final internship ke liye aavedan dene vaali thi
 During her stay in Dehradun, she used to do classes from noon to 5 pm and then worked in the call center from 7 pm to 4 am
 uske dost yaad karte hai ki kis tarah usne chetan bhagat ke upanyaas van nite ait kol centre ko chaat daalaa tha
 On December 16, she saw the film Life of Pi
 vah agle din apane bhaaiyon ko is film kii kahani sunaane vaali thi
 He now feels most lacking in his sister
 vah unki dost hi nahin thi, unka adarsh thi
 Whenever she was going to work, she would talk to her brothers on the phone for hours and they also used to tell her all their private things
 badi bahan ne unase kah diya tha ki jis din use naukari mil jaaegi, us din se ve tution padhaanaa chhodkar apni padhai par dhyaan denge
 He had a complete plan for his brothers
 uske pita bataate hai, “usne pichley maheene hi physiotherapy kii chaar saal kii degree hasil kii thi
 i sincerely hope that soon she will get a good job and help her brothers
 ” uski pehali naukari main har maheene 30,000 ru
 Meet, which was almost four times the monthly income of his father
 uske pita kehete hai, “main maheene main 5,700 ru
 i get salary and work overtime for an additional Rs 5,000
 kama letaa hum
 My daughter used to teach tuition, making Rs 3,000 every month
 aate the
 Both sons teach tuition between Rs 1,500-1,500
 kama lete the
 "he made another promise, but this time not to anyone else but himself
 ek din vah scolership ke liye aavedan karegi or ucch shiksha ke liye videsh jaaegi, shaayad doctor banane ke liye
 When she earns more money, she will buy a big house and an Audi car
 philhal to vah jaldi hi samsung kaa smartphone kharidne vaali thi
 After all this, money was not going to be a problem for him
 uske pita, jo ab baliya ke apane gaanv main hai, kehete hai, “dilli kii mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne mujhe bataaya ki muaavje ke liye 15 lakh ru
 Have kept ready, which will be found when i return
 main nahin jaanata ki main kaise lautoonga
 i do not have any money
 ”uttar pradesh or bihar kii seemaa par sthit unke chote-se gaanv ko pehali acchhee sadak or ek helipad milane vaala he kyonki mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav 12 janvari ko vahaan pahunch rahe hai
 On the occasion of the death of the girl
 uski maa mrityubhoj kaa card dekhakar moorchhit ho jaati hai
 The father is angry
 ve kehete hai, “maine suna he ki akhilesh yadav ek kaarykram yojit karke mujhe 20 lakh ru
 Want to give, but i will not go there
 agar ve sachmuch madad karnaa chaahate hai to unhen mere gaanv main aana chahie
 "hopefully, the government will listen to them

 Former Finance Minister p Chidambaram has questioned the Modi government's decision to discontinue 500 and 1000 rupee notes, saying that it is unthinkable to bring 2000 thousand rupee notes
 ye kaise madad karegaa? 2000 rupee ke note kaa laabh samaj nahin aa rahaa he
 In such a situation, the Congress seems divided, because Janardan Dwivedi has welcomed the decision
 jarnadan dvivedi ne kaha kimodi ne apane chunavi vaayadepure karne kii ore kadam badhaayaa he
 If this decision also prohibits expensive elections, then it is better, because politics is now only for the rich

 The question is when will the new notes be replaced by the old ones
 yah sarkaar ke liye pariksha he
 In 1978, a similar attempt was made by the Janata Party government which failed
 purvavitt mantrine kaha ki hamen samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki jab 500 or 1000 ke note band kiye gaye hai to 2000 rupee kaa note kyon jari kiya ja rahaa
 We welcomed the verdict yesterday, but we have to see if it serves its purpose? Congress leader Rajiv Shukla has also welcomed the Modi government's decision
 lekin unhone kaha ki aam aadmi ko hone vaali samasyaon ko dhyaan main rakhaa janaa chahie

 mamata ne sonia gandhi ke saath 30 minute kii mulaakaat ke baad samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘hamaare bich vistrut charchaa hui
 Soniaji told me that she has held meetings with two-four allies and her first choice is Pranab Mukherjee and second choice is Hamid Ansari
 ’pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri ne kaha ki unhone sonia gandhi se kaha, ‘philhal main kuch nahin kah sakati
 We need to discuss this subject with Mulayam Singh Yadav and also within my own party
 uske baad hi ham kuch kah sakate hai
 Trinamool Congress chief Mamata, the second largest constituent of the UPA, later met Mulayam
 mangalvaar shaam se mamata kii sapa netaa se yah duusari bhent thi
 It is understood that the Trinamool Congress chief and SP chief are coordinating their efforts to get financial packages for their states, respectively, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki congress pramukh se milane ke pehle mamata ne kaha tha ki kendriya rin par byaaj ke bhugtan par teen saal kii roak kii unki maang ko raashtrapati chunaav main samprag ke ummidavaar ko unki party ke samarthan ke saath jodakar nahin dekha janaa chahie
 He told reporters, "no, no, no, support to the UPA in the presidential election has nothing to do with the state's financial package
" donon bhinn chijen hai
 'he said,' Whenever i come to Delhi, such speculation and gossip is planted by some sections
 yah ropana pedo kaa nahin he balki atakalon kaa bazaar garm karnaa he
 i thus condemn the speculation market warming
 ’mamata ne kaha ki pashchim bengal pichhali vammorcha sarkaar kii nitiyon kii vajah se vittiya drushti se sankatpurna sthiti main he, atev unhone teen saal ke byaaj ke bhugtan par roak kii maang kii he
 He said that his demand for a ban is a year-old and has nothing to do with the presidential election
 unhone kaha, ‘maine teen saalon ke liye kendriya rinon par byaaj ke bhugtan par roak kii maang kii he or yah rin meri vajah se nahin he
 If there is no restriction then how will we run the government
 ’ mamata ne kaha, ‘rajya jo kuch bhi kamata he, vah byaaj ke bhugtan main chalaa jaataa he
 This is a very critical situation
 kripaya, ise raashtrapati chunaav se na jodie
 Sources in the Samajwadi Party said its leadership was inclined to support Mukherjee's candidature for the next president
 aisa samajha jaataa he ki haal hi main mulaayam ne apane saansadon se kaha tha ki vah vyaktigat rup se mukherjee ko variyata denge lekin congress ke aupchaarik rup se unka naam ghoshit karne ke baad hi antim nirnay liya jayega
