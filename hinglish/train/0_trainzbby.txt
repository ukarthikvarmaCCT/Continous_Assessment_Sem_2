 There should have been only one option in this situation
 bengal main har haal main chunaav hinsa mukt hona chahie tha
 If an election officer has to beg in front of the police to save his life, this scene is terrible
 hinsa mukt chunaav na karaane ke liye chunaav vyavastha main lage sabhi ko dandit kiya janaa chahie
 Should be dismissed and the election canceled
 kisi bhi surat main hinsa se koi samjhauta nahin
 Otherwise, democracy will only be with those who have either a sword in their hand or who have a crowd armed with bigotry
 chunaav se pehle hi vipaksh ek tihaai siton par ummidavaar khadey nahin kar paaya
 While there are many parties in the opposition
 bijepi, congress, sipiem, left kii anya partiyaan
 If all these together could not field candidates in one-third seats due to fear and violence, then this election should not have been held
 yah kya sandesh de rahaa he? koi vamadalon ke samay hone vaali hinsa ke aankadon se tulana kar rahaa he ki is baar kam he
 This comparison itself is embarrassing
 sawaal he ki aaj bhi hinsa ko kyon jagah mil rahi he
 The responsibility belongs to the Trinamool
 javabdehi se bijepi or sipiem bhi nahin batch sakati he
 This is the truth of Bengal
 sabko hinsa chahie
 Violence is the only way to reach power
 is sthiti main ek hi vikalp hona chahie tha
 In Bengal, elections should have been violence free
 ek chunaav adhikari ko jaan bachaane ke liye agar police ke saamne gidgidaana pade to yah manzar bhayaavah he
 All those engaged in the election system should be punished for not conducting violence-free elections
 barkhaast kar dena chahie or chunaav ko nirast
 In any case, there is no compromise with violence
 varna loktantr sirf unke paas hoga jinke haath main yaa to talwaar hogi yaa jinke paas dharmandhta se las bheed
 There should have been only one option in this situation
 bengal main har haal main chunaav hinsa mukt hona chahie tha

 Writing a letter to 3 big leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party who have consistently rebelled against the Narendra Modi government, Ram Jethmalani said that he has decided to join Mamta Banerjee, who pledged to end the current BJP rule
 
 india today ko prakhyat vakil or rajyasabha saansad ram jethmalani kii ore se bijepi main apane 3 purv sahyogiyon yashavanth sinha, shatrughna sinha or arun shouri ko likhaa ek patr hasil hua he, jisamen unhone jaankaree di ki wo mamata banerjee kii aguwai main anti modi camp main shaamil ho gaye hai
 In a letter written on 12 March, he told that he met the two leaders of BJPK in 2 days
 unhone patr main likhaa ki unhonapradhanmantri narendra modior unke sahyogiyon kii madad kii thi, lekin use bhula diya gaya
 However, in the letter, Jethmalani said that he had not received any proposal to work with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee but had proposed to work with him himself
 jethmalani ne patr main likhaa, 'ai em sori, maine khud ko mamata banerjee ke samaksh prastut kar diya he or unhone mere prastaav kaa khubsuurati se jawaab diya, saath hi kaha ki vah vartmaan bijepi shashan ko khatm karke rahengi
 Ram Jethmalani was expelled from the Bharatiya Janata Party for 6 years in 2013 on charges of indiscipline
 unhone tatkaaleen bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari ko duusari baar adhyaksh banaae jane par sawaal khadaa kar diya tha or unhen khud ko bedaag sabit karne ko kaha
 Jethmalani then sought clarification on his own suspension during a BJP parliamentary board meeting

 'modi does not want Jaitley, but does not have the courage to get rid of', he accused Finance Minister Arun Jaitley that it was he who led him to be expelled from the party
 jethmalani ne unhen 'dhoort' qaraar diya
 He wrote in the letter that Modi and Shah used him fiercely
 haalanki unhone modi kaa yah kehete hue bachaav kiya ki wo jetali ko bahut zyada nahin chaahate, lekin unase chhutkaaraa paane kaa saahas unamem nahin he
 Jethmalani concludes his 3-page letter calling Mamata Banerjee as the Lady of Bengal as the heroine of the rulers of Indian democracy

 Can't bowl the dusra now buddy Stick to one line! Wish @harbhajan_singh and @geeta_basra a happy life together love u both @ YUVSTRONG12 u should also come in a line and play straight now
 No cut pull Significantly, Yuvraj and Harbhajan have been friends of each other since the junior level
 in donon kii saal 2007 main team india kii tii-20 world cap jeet or 2011 kii vanade world jeet main bhi ahm bhoomika rahi thi
 There is no permanent friend or foe in politics, if it were, then BJP President Amit Shah would not have been welcoming Giridhar Gamang, the former Chief Minister of Odisha (now Odisha), with his arms extended
 shah se mulaaqaat ke saath hi gamang kaa bijepi aane kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 This formality will be completed soon
 lekin gamang ke bahaane 17 saal puraane us vishwaas prastaav par matdaan kii yaad zarur tazaa ho gai, jo vaajapeyi sarkaar sirf ek vot se haar gai thi
 It is the 17th of April, 1999
 ediemke ke samarthan waapas lene ke baad vaajapeyi sarkaar ko vishwaas prastaav rakhana padaa
 There was chaos in the corridors of Parliament since morning
 loksabhaa kii kaarywahi shuru hone ke kuch hi der pehle bahujan samaaj party kii netaa mayawati ne kaha ki unki party matdaan main hissaa nahin legi
 Government strategists including Pramod Mahajan breathed a sigh of relief
 sadan kii kaarywahi shuru hote hi sabaki nazaren vipakshi bench par gai jahaan urisa ke mukhyamantri giridhar gamang baithe muskaraa rahe the
 He took the oath of chief minister exactly two months ago on February 18, but did not resign from the Lok Sabha
 wo koraput sansadeey kshetra kii numaaidagi kar rahe the
 Lok Sabha Speaker GMC Balayogi was pointed out by some mps of the ruling party
 lekin niyamanusaar mukhyamantri banane ke chah maheene ke bheetar vidhansabha kaa sadsy bananaa jaruri he, tab tak takneekee taur par saansad rah sakate hai
 Although it is morally right, it is still being debated
 jab mayawati ke bolne kii baari ai, to unhone you turn le liya
 He gave the decision to vote against the trust vote and stirred up the Lok Sabha
 sarkaar kii sthiti pehle hi najuk thi
 Pramod Mahajan was seen barricading till the last moment
 patrkaar ddeergha khachaakhach bhari hui thi
 i found a place to sit on the stairs and from there the speakers table can be seen clearly
 matdaan hua
 Gamang voted against the government
 tab neshnal conference ke saansad safuddin soz ne party line ke khilaaf jaakar sarkaar ke khilaaf vot diya
 Votes counted
 maine dekha ki balyogi baar-baar apni tarjani unguli uthaa kar vaajapeyi ko ishaara karne lage
 It was clear from his facial expressions that he was indicating that the government lost by one vote
 thodi der baad spikar ne elaan kiya ki vishwaas prastaav ke paksh main 269 or virodh main 270 vot pade
 Thirteen months old Vajpayee government had fallen
 puraa sadan achaanak khamosh ho gaya
 Then the enthusiasm of the opposition parties erupted
 sharad pavaar uthakar mayawati ke paas gaye or garmjoshi se unka shukriya adaa kiya
 Congress mps were constantly shaking hands with Gamang and Soz
 vaajapeyi ne haath sir se laga kar salaam kar sadan kaa faisla mana
 Later, it was revealed that Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia had become emotional in his chamber and Vajpayee was also distracted by tying her up
 uske baad raajnneeti kaa chakra jis tarah ghumaa, wo ab itihaas kaa hissaa he
 If the government had got one more vote, it would have been a tie and the speaker could have saved the government by casting a vote
 gamang ab safai dete gum rahe hai ki unke vot se vaajapeyi sarkaar nahin giri
 He says Chief Whip asked him to vote
 unke mutabiq vaajapeyi sarkaar to soz ke vot se giri thi
 Gamang is a big name in Orissa politics
 wo koraput seat se 1972 se lagaataar aath baar saansad rahe or 2004 main phir isi seat se jite
 Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and PV Narasimha Rao were central ministers in the government
 18 farvari, 1999 se 6 disambar, 1999 tak urisa ke mukhyamantri rahe
 The comments bijepi kaa kahana he ki 72 saal ke gamang ke rup main ek bada adivasee netaa mila he
 Both Congress and BJP have failed to break the magic of Naveen Patnaik in the state and BJP says that the arrival of Gamang will help it to increase its strength
 gamang ke ek vot se vaajapeyi sarkaar ke girane ke sawaal ko bijepi bhi ab zyada tool nahin dena chaahati he
 Like Gamang, he now says that Soz was responsible for this
 yahi siyasat kaa mizaaj he, jahaan banati-bigadati, dosti-dushmani main pichhali baton ko bhulaakar hi aage badha jaataa he
 With the meeting with Shah, the way for Gamang to come to BJP has been cleared
 jaldi hi ye aupchaarikta puri ho jaaegi
 But on the pretext of Gamang, the memory of voting on the 17-year-old trust motion was refreshed, which the Vajpayee government lost by just one vote
 baat he 17 april, 1999 kii
 The Vajpayee government had to move a confidence motion after the withdrawal of AIADMK support
 subah se hi sansad ke galiyaaron main gahamagahami thi
 Shortly before the commencement of the Lok Sabha proceedings, Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati said that her party would not take part in the voting
 pramod mahajan samet sarkaar ke ranneetikaron ne raahat kii saans lee
 As soon as the proceedings of the House started, everyone's eyes went to the Opposition Bench where Orissa Chief Minister Giridhar Gamang was smiling
 wo thik do maheenon pehle yani 18 farvari ko mukhyamantri pad kii shapath le chuke the, magar unhone loksabhaa se istifa nahin diya tha
 He was representing Koraput parliamentary constituency
 sattapaksh ke kuch saansadon kii ore se loksabhaa adhyaksh jiemasi balyogi kaa is ore dhyaan dilaayaa gaya
 But according to the rules, it is necessary to become a member of the Legislative Assembly within six months of becoming the Chief Minister, till then technically mps can remain
 haalanki naitik taur par ye kitna sahi he, is par aaj bhi bahes ho rahi he
 When Mayawati came to speak, she took a U-turn
 unhone vishwaas mat ke virodh main vot daalane kaa faisla sunaaya or loksabhaa main hadakamp much gaya
 The government's position was already critical
 pramod mahajan aakhri vakt tak morchabandi karte dekhe ja rahe the
 The journalist gallery was packed
 mujhe sidhiyon par baithne kii jagah mil gai thi or vahaan se spikar kii teble saaf dekhi ja sakati he
 Voting took place
 gamang ne sarkaar ke khilaaf vot diya
 Then National Conference MP Saifuddin Soz went against the party line and voted against the government
 voton kii ginati hui
 i saw that Balayogi repeatedly pointed to Vajpayee by lifting his index finger
 unke chehre ke bhav se spasht tha ki wo ishaara kar rahe hai ki sarkaar ek vot se haar gai
 After a while, the speaker announced that 269 votes were cast in favor of the motion of confidence and 270 in opposition
 teraa maheene puraani vaajapeyi sarkaar gir chuki thi
 The whole house suddenly became silent
 phir vipakshi partiyon kaa utsaah foot padaa
 Sharad Pawar got up and went to Mayawati and thanked her warmly
 congressi saansad gamang or soz se lagaataar haath mila rahe the
 Vajpayee saluted with his head and accepted the decision of the House
 baad main pataa chalaa ki unke chembar main rajmata vijayaraaje sindhiya bhavuk ho gayi thi or unhen dhankos bandhaate hue vaajapeyi bhi vichlit ho gaye the
 After that the way the circle of politics turned, it is now part of history
 agar sarkaar ko ek vot or mila hota to taai ho jaataa or spikar vot daal kar sarkaar ko bachaa sakate the
 Gamang is now clarifying that the Vajpayee government did not fall with his vote
 unka kahana he ki cheef vip ne unase matdaan karne ko kaha tha
 According to him, the Vajpayee government had fallen with Soz's vote
 urisa kii raajnneeti main gamang ek bada naam he
 He was an MP from Koraput seat eight times since 1972 and won again in 2004 from this seat
 indira gandhi, rajeev gandhi or pivi narsimharav kii sarkaar main kendriya mantri rahe
 He was the Chief Minister of Odisha from 18 February 1999 to 6 December 1999
 tippaniyan The BJP says it has got a big tribal leader in the form of 72-year-old Gamang
 rajya main naveen patnayak kaa jaadu todane main congress or bijepi donon naakaam rahe hai or bijepi kaa yahi kahana he ki gamang ke aane se use apni takat badhaane main madad milegi
 The BJP also does not want to give too much weight to the question of the fall of the Vajpayee government by a vote of Gamang
 gamang kii hi tarah uskaa bhi ab kahana he ki iske liye soz zimmedaar the
 This is the mood of the politics, where in the worsening, friendship-enmity, the past things are forgotten and carried forward
 baat he 17 april, 1999 kii

" ’’ raay ne kaha ki zyaadaatar niveshkon ko unki dhanrashi waapas kar di gai or shesh raashi jo waapas kii jaani he vah bazaar niamak ke paas he
 Rai said that SEBI asked him if he had more assets than that he had announced
 unhone kaha ‘‘mujhase meri vyaktigat parisampatti ke bare main poocha gaya or maine unako jawaab diya ki maine apni puri sampatti kaa khulaasa kar diya he
 He said that the Sahara group was concerned about the delay in refunding the investment amount by SEBI to investors and accused the regulator of not taking any steps for the past several months to return the money to the investors

 yah pataa nahin lag sakaa he ki raay or unke anya sahyogiyon ne aaj apni sampattiyon ke byore prastut kiye yaa nahin
 SEBI had asked these firms and their top officials to submit details of assets and accounts etc
 by 8 April
 sebi ne kaha tha ki yadi ye chaaron vyakti hajir na hue to vah unki anupasthiti main hi sampattiyon kii nilaamee kii sharten tay kar saktaa he
 SEBI said last month that its orders have not been complied with

 bal thakare ko jaananaa kaa maukafilm ke dekhne kii sabase badi vajah bal thakare hi hai
 His life was no less controversial
he was accused of spreading regionalism, fanatic and religious politics unpar marathi ke naam kshetreeyata failaane, kattar or dharmik raajnneeti kaa aarope laga tha
 His conflicting statements against Biharis and Muslims along with South Indians remained in discussion
 kaise thakare cartoonist se lokapriy netaa bane? maratha maanush kaa andolan shuru kar kaise kshetreeyata ko ek bada mudda bana diya? darshak unki jindagi se jude aise sawaal jaanane ke icchhuk honge
 Viewers can turn to the theater to see how these issues are portrayed in the movie

 latur se 10 kilometre pehle harangul ke najadik tikhi gandh se aapkaa dam ghutane lagata he
 This foul smell is coming from the sugar mill
 matlab yah ki ganne kii perai shahar main charam par he
 Latur is the same city which was declared a 'drought-hit city' two years ago
 ab yahaan kheton main khadey 'pani sokhne vaali ganne kii vajah se (2017 main barish acchhee hui thi) chaaron taraf hariyaali he
 Seven of the 11 sugar mills here are running day and night and so many borewells are being dug as never before
 sookhe ke baad jaankaron ne kaha tha ki khub sara pani sokhne vaali ganne kii kheti hi sookhe kii badi vajah he
 In fact, the Water and Irrigation Commission under the chairmanship of Madhav Chitale recommended banning of sugarcane cultivation throughout Marathwada
 latur bhi mahaj do saal pehle tak isi marathavada kaa hissaa hua karata tha
 Chitale, former chairman of the Central Water and Irrigation Commission, says that sugarcane is sucking Marathwada water, which has become prized anyway due to irregular and very little rainfall in the area
 ve bataate hai, ''marathavada main sinchai kaa 70 fisadi pani ab ganne main khap jaataa he
 Pradeep Purandare, another professor at the Institute of Water and Land Management, Aurangabad, also says that there is a relationship between sugarcane and drought in the region
 beshak, is saal latur main ganne kii kheti lahalha rahi he to isaki vajah yahi he ki 2017 main yahaan ausat se zyada barish (650 mimi) hui
 Apart from this, on the initiative of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's organization Art of Living (AOL) and RSS, the local people have worked to widen and deepen the Manjara river on the Nagjhri barrage, due to which the excess water reserves have accumulated
 aresas ke kaaryakarta shivadas mitkaari kehete hai ki ‘jalayukt latur’ pariyojna ne—jisamen tamaam siyaasi vichaardhaaraon ke kaaryakartaaon ne yogadan diya—pani kaa str 8 meter badhaane main madad kii he
 The problem is that most of this water is spent in sugarcane farming
 kisaan avaidh tareeke se pani nikaal rahe hai
 India Today saw at least 50 pump machines in an area of just 100 meters
 yah bairaj isliye bhi ahm he, kyonki latur ko peyajal supplai isi se hoti he
 a crisis arose in 2016 due to taking water from this barrage for sugarcane irrigation
 lekhak or jal sangrakshan kaaryakarta atul deulganvkar kehete hai ki agar ganne kii kheti or borwell kii khudaai par lagaam nahin lagaai gai, to latur ko nikat bhavishya main gambhir sookhaa jhelana pad saktaa he
 He says, "being a water-stressed area, Latur is in dire need of good water management
 ’’ unka aarope he ki sarkaar ganne kii kheti ke liye drip irigation ko anivaary banane kii niti par amal ko lekar gambhir nahin he
 Deulgaonkar says, "the government is under the misconception that its pioneering plan will relieve the Jalayunant Shivar (fields filled with water) from drought
 is yojana kaa khaakaa hi gadabad he or ise thekedaaron ke rahamokaram par chalaaya ja rahaa he
 "AOL chief in Latur, Makarand Jadhav, says that drip irrigation is the demand for Vanta but farmers cannot afford it
" sarkaar 60 fisadi kharch jarur lautaa detii he, par vah system lagane ke baad ise lautaati he
 The cost of drip irrigation system in one acre is Rs 1 lakh
 aati he
 He says, "for farmers, other expenses are necessary first, such as children's education
" ’’west indian sugar mills association ke president or natural sugar mills ke chairman bi
 B
 thombare ganne kii kheti ke haq main zyada hai
 According to him, there is an illusion that sugarcane cultivation takes too much water
 ve daleel dete hai ki aisa koi vaigyanik adhyayan nahin he jo sabit kare ki ganna dher sara pani sokhta he
 He says, "my experience says that 1 hectare of sugarcane crop in a flow irrigation system
 5 karod litre pani kii jarurat hoti he
 If drip irrigation is used, this requirement comes down to 7
5 lakh liters
 yah soyabean or gehun ke baraabar he
 "they also say that farmers need to be educated about the use of water
 pichley 42 saal se chini milon kaa kaamkaaj sambhaal rahe thombare kehete hai, ''ganne kii kheti kam pani main bhi kii ja sakati he
 But farmers are giving it non-essential water
 ’’jal sangrakshan kaaryakarta amol gowande kehete hai ki kisaan ganna isliye ugaate hai kyonki yah nakadi fasal he
 Any second crop is Rs 1 lakh per acre
 kaa munafa nahin detii
 This year the sugar mills of Latur gave farmers a cane of Rs 2,200
 prati ton daam chukaaya he jabaki soyabean kaa unhen 2,800 rupye prati ton daam mila
 The yield per acre of sugarcane is much higher than that of soyabean, hence the profit is also high
 gowande kehete hai, ‘‘agar aap unhen aamadani kii guarantee den, to kisaan pakke taur par ganne kii kheti se munh mode lenge
 "they suggest that sugar mills should take steps that encourage farmers to drip irrigation
" deulganvkar latur main borwell kii andhadhundh khudaai kii taraf bhi dhyaan dilaate hai
 According to government figures, Latur, a city with a population of 5,00,000, has around 50,000 borewells
 ahmadpur ke ek kisaan harishchandra yarge ne apane khet main 63 borwell khode hai jinamein se 57 ab suukh chuke hai
 The remaining six have very little water
 yarge kehete hai, ‘‘maine pani kii talash main aisa kiya
 Now i would not recommend anyone to install a borewell
 ’’ deulganvkar kehete hai ki yarge kaa maamla isaki ahm misaal he ki is ilaake ke kisaan kitne najuk daur se guzar rahe hai
 Politics are also the reason for the high number of sugar mills in Latur
 1986 tak ilaake main ek bhi chini mil nahin thi
 That year, former Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh started the Manjara Sugar Mill
 tab se yahaan 11 chini milen lagaai ja chuki hai, baavjood iske ki pani kii jabardast kami he
 Deshmukh's brother Dilip and his MLA son Amit have direct control over four of them
 amit kii company ko ek or chini mil lagane kii ijaajat mil gai he
 It has been named 21 Century Sugar Mill
 pichley maheene jab registration shuru hue to pehle hi din 40,000 kisaanon ne sadsyta ke farm bhar die
 Sugar mills are a tool to woo voters for the Deshmukh family
 koi kisaan chini mil kaa sadsy banataa he to uskaa vot bhi tay ho jaataa he kyonki mil prabandhan hi uski fasal kii kismat tay karata he
 The Congress, led by Amit Deshmukh, lost the Latur Municipal Corporation election last year to the BJP for the first time in 25 years
 so, amit ke liye sitambar 2019 main aglaa vidhansabha chunaav jeetna aasaan nahin hoga
 Their expectations are based on the sugar mill politics
 congress ke ek sutara kehete hai ki amit latur gramin seat se sabase chote bhai dhiraj ko utaarna chaahate hai
 He says, "this seat is in the sugarcane strip
 paanchavin chini mil unki kismat kaa faisla karne vaali sabit ho sakati he

 Fast bowler r Vinaykumar took four wickets for 30 runs before England landed for batting 48

 England middle-order batsmen Jonathan Trott (34), Kevin Pietersen (46), Ravi Bopara (36), Samit Patel (42) and Jani Bairstow (35) did not turn a good start into a big score after losing the first two wickets to zero

 It had been two and a half hours since midnight
 jammu-kashmir police (jecapi) kaa ek dasta srinagar ke press enklev ke praveshdwar par ghaat lagaakar baitha tha
 a few minutes later, a lone van appeared to be carefully guarded by the concertina wire webs scattered on the road

 The silencing of the media was part of the latest stringent action that was started afresh after the assassination of Burhan Wani

 This resulted in a wave of anger in the valley, which was also seen on network television
 yah gussa jagah-jagah sadakon par virodh pradarshnon kii baadh main footne laga
 This surprised the state police, paramilitary forces and the army
 unhone paaya ki ve logon kii ugr bheed ke haathon phenke ja rahe pattharon or petrol bamon kii lagaataar barish ke nishane par hai
 When these protests, which suddenly broke out in the most unlikely places, came to be about a fortnight, the government of Jammu and Kashmir's Peoples Democratic Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party led by Mehbooba Mufti officially acknowledged that the bullet and shotgun ( Pellet gun) wounds have killed 37 protesters
 chaunkaane vaali badi taadaad main 1,948 nagarikon ko chotein ain, jinamein aadmi, auraten or chaar saal jitne chote bachche bhi shaamil hai
 From Srinagar, these figures were quickly passed on to Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, as he was supposed to reply to the Lok Sabha on 18 July
 unhone bataaya ki 1,671 surakshakarmi bhi ghayal hue hai, jinamein se kuch hathgolon or bandook kii goliyon se jakhmi hue hai
 The police also raided several raids at Rangreth and Humhuma in Budgam on the outskirts of Srinagar before the 'press Enclave ambush' of 16 July
 ise satta pratishthan kii hataasha ke saboot ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he, jo kisi na kisi tarah jaldi hi halaat par kaabo paanaa chahta he kyonki aisa nahin hua to halaat aasaani or teji se kashmiri logon or suraksha balon ke bich ek or lambey or kadave takaraav main badal sakate hai (2010 kii gussell garmiyon main aise hi takaraavon main 112 logon kii jaan gai thi)
 Mehbooba Mufti attacked the then Chief Minister Omar Abdullah in 2010, saying that he was 'unable to establish an alliance with the Kashmiris', now his administration's response to the rapidly unfolding crisis is firmly blunt and blunt Used to be
 misaal ke liye press kaa munh band karne ko hi len
 Shujaat Bukhari, editor-in-chief of Rising Kashmir, says that all the editors residing in Srinagar were called separately and the state government's decision to stop the publication 'in view of further escalation of the crisis in the valley' was given

" 
 
 akhabaaron ko band karnaa sirf asthaayee upaay he
 He also stressed that it is not possible to distribute newspapers in the current curfew condition

 But the problem is not just that the security forces were allowing the movement of vehicles and pedestrians as per the well thought-out strategy for restoring normalcy in Banibasan shanti Srinagar
 dikkat yah bhi he ki unke shiksha mantri kii munhajbani press sensorship kii 'safai' die jane ke mushkil se do din baad srinagar man' gupakar road se sate apane sarkari ghar ferevyuu kii suraksha or sukh-suvidhaon main baithkar mukhyamantri ne is kadam ke uthaae jane se hi inkaar kar diya
 On July 18, when the Information and Broadcasting Minister Venkaiah Naidu called up after a mild uproar in the Lok Sabha on the issue, Mehbooba said to him, "there is no restriction on newspapers
" '' iske kuch hi vakt baad unke salaahkaar amitabh matatu ne daawa kiya ki mukhyamantri aise kisi faisle main shaamil nahin thim
 a day later, they found a handy goat in Budgam SP Fayyaz Ahmad Lone, whose men had apparently raided the raids

 However, it is also true that only Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti and her closest PDP confidants are holding the front in Srinagar (many BJP ministers and mlas are suddenly on the other side of Banihal's tunnel to spend their holidays in Jammu to their homes Have returned)
 vaani kii hatya ke baad upje halaat main rajya sarkaar kii pratikriyaayein ghabrahat bhari or dukhad taur par peeche hatane par utaaru rahi hai, maano use kuch sujh hi na rahaa ho
 Both the state police and the political leadership made huge mistakes right from the beginning in dealing with the encounter of Kokernag and the subsequent situation
 aap maane yaa na maane, magar ab yah baat saamne ai he ki hijbul mujahidin ke maare gaye commander kii pehali tasviren khud jammu-kashmir police ke karmiyon ne soshal media par daali thim! phir hatya ke ek din baad 9 july ko srinagar main ek press conference ko sambodhit karte hue rajya ke atirikt mahanideshak (khufia) es

 Geelani broadly hinted that "the chief minister was aware of the police action" while the action was still going on
 haalanki mahabuuba teen din baad jab video ke jariye ek jajbaati apil karne ke liye saamne ain, tab unhone is baat se inkaar kiya
 But the perception has become that the PDP government was also actively involved in what many people see as a 'hanging' of Wani, and this perception can be responsible for the extreme rage especially in South Kashmir
 asal main mukhyamantri ke grih jile anantnag ko sabase badtareen maar jhelni padi he or police karrwai main maare gaye logon main se takreeban aadhe isi jile main maare gaye hai
 It also encouraged PDP MP and former Deputy Chief Minister Muzaffar Baig to react in a rude manner
 unhone jor dekar kaha ki police karrwai ke maanak tareeke nahin apanaae gaye, agar apanaae gaye hote to vaani ko jinda pakadaa ja saktaa tha
 Not only has he demanded an inquiry, but on July 18 told India Today TV that the Jammu and Kashmir police officers had "betrayed" him by hiding information from the Chief Minister
 beg kii gussell baton ko maanane vaale bahut log dilli main na bhi hon, magar 8 july ke baad ferevyuu main hui baithkon ke jaankaar ek varisht afasar kehete hai ki ek se zyada maukon par prashasnic adhikariyon ne mukhyamantri kii hidaayaton ko andekha kiya
 They say that the decision to announce the reopening of the school from 18 July in Srinagar was agreed upon one evening earlier
 ve kehete hai, ''magar jo press vijyapti jari kii gai usamen kuch rahasyamayi vajahon se kaha gaya ki skulon kii chhuttiyaan ek or hakrate ke liye badha di gai hai!''baahar sadakon par hameshaa kii tarah yahi kaha ja rahaa he, ''sab kuch dilli se rachaa ja rahaa he
 Sitting in a cozy office in one of the many government buildings in the Press Enclave, Bukhari says that this common perception is not baseless, "from Farooq Abdullah to Mehbooba Mufti in Srinagar and Indira Gandhi to Narendra Modi in Delhi to Kashmir
" Nothing has changed in the system that drives it
 sirf chehre badalte rahete hai

 Shotguns throwing rubber bullets have been used as a last resort before firing the first bullets, but now security forces have been instructed to disperse the mob over 70-80 yards of accumulated violence
 To do this, use it in the beginning and also use tear gas as well
 pichley hakrate nakli nishaanon par rabar kii goliyaan chalaane kaa abhyaas karne vaale ek police adhikari kaa kahana he, ''samasya yah thi ki jab tak shotgan bheje jate the, tab tak pradarshnkaree bahut najadik pahunch chuke hote the

 "and perhaps this is not the first time that this police officer agrees with the opinion of the Hurriyat's moderate leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who told India Today that Delhi's only" insistence on military measures (of Kashmiris) is complete " Generation will continue on the path of violence

 Before this, another video came out in which they were shouting at the elderly couple
 ye log 19 lakh ke farjivade kii shikaayat lekar unke paas pahunche the
 During a tour at the time of Lok Sabha elections, when a journalist asked him questions about the CM window, he was jittery and he even gave the advice to the journalist to learn the tameez
 2019 ke chunaav ne 2014 se peechha chhudaa liya he
 The 2019 election is an election to forget 2014
 bijepi ke prachaar postaron ko dekhakar yahi lagata he ki vah 2014 se bhaag rahi he
 The BJP has put new posters on the posters of 2014
 nae muddon kii marketing ho rahi he
 These posters have been coerced by coined taglines
 unka bhav skool main fail hone vaale us chaatr kii tarah he jo ghar aakar bataata he ki bahut saare bachche fail ho gaye
 This time the copy itself is not checked properly
 modi kii bachi-khuchi raajnneetik kamyaabi yahi he ki vipaksh ke baaki netaa or unki sarkarein bhi fail rahi hai
 Felder does another job
 ghar main bataata he ki sab fail hue hai magar mohalle main bataata he ki vah paas ho gaya he
 Nobody shows their results
 bharat kii pariksha vyavastha main shaamil 50 fisadi se adhik chaatro kii yahi kahani he
 This is the story of Narendra Modi
 isliye jab aap is baar ke bijepi ke poster dekhte hai to hairaan ho jate hai
 Look at where the 2014 slogans went
 prachaaron kaa koi prachaar nahin he
 In 2014 people themselves used to promote those promotions
 sena or isro kaa istamaal na hota to is chunaav main modi ko apana hi poster lagane ke liye mudda nahin miltaa
 Modi, who drove away terrorism, is seen staring
 hajipur main digha pul se pehle laga antariksh kii kamyaabi kaa poster dekhakar lagata he ki jaise ghar aakar chaatr ne mata ko apni copy kii jagah duusare chaatr kii bhari hui copy dikhaa di ho
 In 2014, Modi sold the dream
 2019 main modi apni asafalataa bech rahe hai
 Journalists from Delhi are looking for modi-modi resonance among the people
 2014 main mike nikaalte hi awaz aane lagati thi modi-modi
 In 2019, the voice is not heard when the mic is taken out among the public
 patrkaar sadame main aa jate hai
 People are not doing modi-modi because of this media
 jab tivi din raat modi-modi kar rahaa he to ab unke liye kya bachaa he
 Media is sold out
 dar gaya he
 Only shows Modi
 sabhi bhale na samajhen ho magar aapako aisi baat karne vaale log badi sankhya main har tarah kii bheed main milenge
 From the young to the elderly, you will find that Modi's media is dock media
 jab media kii vishwasaneeyata samaapt he to us khandhar par modi ke sapanom kaa ghaas kitna haraa ho jayega
 This is overshadowed by Modi's supporters
 ve sharminda ho jate hai
 Modi could not do with that pride like he did in 2014
 main yah baat nattejey ke sandarbh main nahin kah rahaa ki modi haar jaaenge
 i do not ask this question to anyone nor am i interested in it
 meraa lekh is par he ki modi khud se haar rahe hai
 When the 2014 winners start losing themselves, they should see the face of the people who want to vote for Modi
 chupake se poochta he ki kya modi ne ek bhi acha kaam nahin kiya he
 This question was coined for those critics, but the supporters are stuck
 isliye na to vah 2014 kii tarah modi kii sabha main dauda dauda ja rahaa he or na hi unke bhaashanon par dil lutaa rahaa he
 Modi's critics have more questions
 ve 2014 main har bahes haar jate the
 Now they defeat BJP supporters in every debate
 unke vot se modi bhale na haaren, magar unke sawaalon se modi ke samarthak bahes haarane lage hai
 So they are silent
 maahaul dekhne waalon kii pidaa maahaul kaa na milanaa he magar jo maahaul banaata he uski pidaa kaa kya
 2019 is piercing him
 bhaajapa ke matadaataaon ko nahin laga tha ki itani jaldi modi ke vikalp kaa sawaal unke saamne aa khadaa hoga
 Modi will become compulsor than necessary
 jab koi netaa majaburi kaa vikalp hota he tab janata chup ho jaati he
 She does not look at each other
 2014 main sab ek duusare se nazaren milaate the, modi-modi karte the
 Voters who like Modi have become introverted like whatsapp
 fasebuk kii tarah baahar nahin bol rahe hai
 whatsapp University has changed his character
 paanch saal tarah tarah ke jhooth ko nigalane ke baad ugala nahin ja rahaa he
 The lie made him aggressive at first and has made him alone
 modi ke samarthak netaa ke vikalp par baat karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 If you give an option, then they are ready to talk to anyone except Modi
 ghar ghar modi kii jagah, modi nahin to koun kaa sawaal unke bheetar banane laga he
 This voter sees the reality of politics on the ground
 usne sabko dekha he or modi ko bhi dekh liya he
 What should he do
 kya modi par vishwaas karne kii sazaa khud ko de? vah jhooth or propeganda se peechha chhudaana chahta he
 He does not have dreams like 2014 in this election
 idhar na udhar
 To whom should he take the pain of being cheated again and again
 patrkaar modi kii pidaa samajhate hai, janata kii pidaa nahin
 The public is standing in the midst of their suffering
 modi ko bhi usase sahanubhuti nahin he
 Not talking about his suffering, he is beating the success of space in a field where there is no water to drink
 yahi kaaran he ki janata ko vikalpon main sambhaavna nazar nahin aati he
 Every option is a hoax for him
 sabane us janata ko akelaa kar diya he
 That is why you do not see modi-modi
 aap riselt jaananaa chaahate hai janata apana haal bataanaa chaahati he
 Therefore, the election of 2019 is an election of the shocked public
 2014 ne modi samarthakon ko ek samuhikta di thi
 Many dreams tied Modi's voters in one thread
 aaj un sapanom kii kahin koi baat nahin he
 Suppressed by propaganda and guilt of lies, Modi's voter will not want anyone to know when he votes
 vah nahin chahta he ki kisi ko pataa chale ki usne apni galati doharaai he
 No one held his hand firmly from the opposition's side
 use nae or achche sapanom ke sahare daldal se nikaalane ke liye kisi ne haath nahin badhaayaa
 The vote given to Modi is now personal
 samuhik nahin he
 This has changed in 2014 to 2019

 bisisiai ne khilaadiyon ko apni patni saath le jane kii ijaajat di hui he, lekin england daure ke liye vaais captain viraat ke maamle main rule thode badale gaye
 The way Kohli failed during the Test series in England, the whole affair worsened
 'mail today' se baat karte hue bisisiai ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki secretary ne england daure par management se baat karke viraat kohli ko anoushka ko saath le jane kii ijaajat dilwaai thi
 He told, 'now you call it hypocrisy or social restrictions, Indian players were allowed to take their wives along
 lekin viraat ne board se anurodh kiya ki unhen anoushka ko saath le jane kii ijaajat mili
 When the management was in confusion about this demand, Patel called the management and asked to obey Virat
 'ab kuch board adhikariyon kaa maananaa he ki manager sunil dev ko is maamle ko apni report main shaamil karnaa chahie
 a senior BCCI official said, 'I think in the current situation, they will not press the matter just because Virat is also from Delhi
 main khud bhi chahta hum ki wo is maamle ko apni report main shaamil karen
 But he himself will take the final decision
 ' The problem of potholes on the roads is affecting not only the capital Delhi but all the cities of the country
 barsaat ke dinon main jalairao kii vajah se ye gadde jaanaleva ho jate hai
 But the officials who are responsible for repairing the roads, they sleep by putting oil in their ears
 aise hi adhikariyon ko jagaane ke liye pune ke logon ne gadde kaa 'happy berthde' manaaya
 In fact, a large crater on a main road near Pune has been living for many years
 pune-mumbai haive ke saath dehu road par is gadde ko thik karaane ke liye logon ne cantonmant board ke adhikariyon se kai baar guhaar lagaai, lekin koi sud nahin lee gai
 The officials kept on replying that when the contract for repairing the road would be given, the contractor would be asked to fill this pit
 kai logon or lag chuki he chobdhikariyon kaa ye ravaiya is hakeekat ke baavjood rahaa ki is gadde kii vajah se bujurgon or bacchon samet kai log ghayal ho chuke hai
 Finally fed up, the locals decided to celebrate the birthday of the pit to awaken the Cantonment Board administration sleeping in Kumbhakurni
 iske liye aasapaas rahane vaale logon ko nyotaa diya gaya
 Rangoli made, decorated rangoli near inflated balloons
 yaheen nahin rangabirange gubaare lagaakar puure jashn kaa maahaul diya gaya
 Then the big cake was cut and the first piece was poured into the pit
 maujuud sabhi logon ne 'happy berthde' geet bhi gaaya
 People hoped that perhaps by celebrating the birthday of the pit, the officer will wake up and get rid of this pit

 congress ne guuruuvaar ko 117 loksabhaa siton par matdaan ke bich varanasi main namakan daakhil karne or road sho ke prasaaran ko lekar narendra modi par chunaav aachaar samhita ke gambhir ulanghan kaa aarope lagaate hue unke khilaaf praathmiki darj karaane kii maang kii he
 Congress spokesperson and Union Minister Anand Sharma told reporters in Delhi, 'we do not want to issue notices only
 ham karrwai chaahate hai
 An FIR should be lodged against all the BJP leaders involved in it, including the candidate from Varanasi
 ' Sharma said that broadcasting Modi's roadshow and filing his nomination is a serious violation of the election code of conduct
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki yah aaj matdaan vaale loksabhaa kshetron main matadaataaon ko prabhavit karne kii bhaajapa kii suniyojit yojana thi
 He said that the law is very clear that campaigning cannot be done on the day of voting
 sharma ne kaha ki bhaajapa ke vistrut kaarykram kaa prasaaran subah 8 baje se aparaahn 3 baje tak kiya gaya
 He asked why the Election Commission was not conscious about this and why the media was not advised not to broadcast it in polling areas today
 unhone kaha ki jo kuch hua vah asweekaarya he
 Sharma did not pay any attention to the question that when Rahul Gandhi filed his nomination in Amethi and it was telecast live, voting was going on in Tripura that day
 congress netaa ne kaha ki aaj 117 siton par matdaan ho rahaa he or yah sankhya nau charnon main ho rahe chunaav ke kisi ek charan main duusari sabase zyada he
 He said, 'we expect the Election Commission to take appropriate action
 yah janpratinidhitiv kanoon kaa ghor ulanghan he
 ' sharma se jab poocha gaya ki kya party sabhi 117 siton par punarmatdaan kii maang karegi to unhone kaha, 'ham chunaav ayog ke jawaab kaa intjaar karenge
 When asked whether the Congress has thought of going to the President on this issue, he only said, 'one step should be taken at a time
 ' When Alka Lamba did not get a Congress ticket in the Delhi Assembly elections, she also expressed her discomfort on Facebook
 magar yah bhi likhaa ki desh, maa or party ko choda nahin jaataa
 But today Alka left the Congress and joined the same Aam Aadmi Party, which she used to fight till recently
 alka kaa kahana he ki vah pichley teen saal se rahul gandhi se milakar apni baat rakhane kii koshish kar rahi thim, magar unhen samay nahin mila
 But Alka's Facebook page says something else

 The date on the photo is written 6 June
 yani tab tak sab thik tha
 The mess or say resentment started after the ticket was cut
 jaraa gaur karen alka ke bayanon par
 
 
 Alka posted this update on his Facebook page on 14 December- Rahul Gandhi has rightly said that we should learn from 'AAP' and by learning from new man or new party, man does not become 'small' but learns something
 It is, in many Mayans, 'AAP' has changed the ways of 'seeing' and 'doing' politics, and what could have been better than this had it started from Delhi, the capital of India
 
 Now the AAP should also come forward to discharge its responsibilities from the allegations
 isse pehle dilli chunaavon ke dauraan alka ne congress ke liye vot maangate hue yah states apadet kiya- dilli-nivasee va congress kii ek kaaryakarta hone ke naate main aap sabhi dilli-vaasiyon se ummid ore nivedan karti hum ki aap sabhi 4 disambar ko apana keemtee vot sirf ore sirf vikaas ke naam par ore vikaas ko zaari rakhane ke liye denge
 If the ticket was not received, such a pained Lamba wanted to contest the Delhi Assembly elections on a Congress ticket
 daavedaari ke dauraan unhone bijepi or aam aadmi party par sawaal uthaate hue fasebuk par likhaa ki mahilaon kii bhagidaari, suraksha or adhikaron kii baat karne vaale rajnatik dalon kii kalai khulne lagi he
 So far in the Delhi Assembly elections, the AAP party has made 6 to 7 out of 70 and BJP 4 to 5 women candidates
 kathani or kerani main zamin aasmaan kaa antar
 Now it is the turn of Congress, i hope that at least Congress will live up to the expectations of women
 magar jab alka ko tikat nahin mila to unhone 15 november ko likhaa ki kuch logon ko party main sab kuch, kuch ko kuch kuch or kuch ko kuch bhi nahin miltaa he, kuch ko sab kuch 'muft' main ore kuch ko us kuch kii baari 'keemat' chukaani padati he, ore kuch 'mere' jaise bhi hote hai, naaraazgi nahin thami
 But Alka still said that she will remain in the Congress
 unhone likhaa ki desh, maa or party chodi nahin jaati balki unki jimmedaari lee jaati he or main teenon kii seva ke liye ek deshbhakt, beti or kaaryakarta ke taur par vachanabaddh hum

 On Tuesday, the central government held a meeting on inflation, in which Finance Minister Jaitley, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh and Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan were present
 is baithak main kharaab monsoon kii khabaron ke bich mahangaai rokane kaa plan taiyaar hona tha
 After the meeting, after seeing the information that the Finance Minister gave to the media about the preparations to stop inflation, it seemed that the new government is taking some steps, but some questions are being raised about how effective those steps will be, because i myself have watched the food inflation very closely for a long time and covered it so i am writing an understanding
 sarkaar ne kaha ki rajyon ko salaah di gai he ki kii fal or sabzi ko apiemasi kii list se baahar kar de, jise kisaan ke paas yah opshan hoga ki mandi main bina aadhati yaa kahen bichauliye ke apni upaj ko khud bech saktaa he
 The logic in this is that the difference between the price the farmer sells and the price the buyer buys will be less
 main ajadpur mandi gaya or kisaanon se baat kii to rajasthan ke jhunjhunu se aae pyaaj kisaan mahavir ne bataaya, main apana maal khud nahin bech saktaa, koi kilo, do kilo, thode hi bechnaa he, puure 250 katte hai
 Talking to some other farmers, it was understood that selling the goods by the farmer himself sounds good, but it will not be easy
 asal main kisaan vyapaaree nahin he, mandi main jo kharidaar aata he, vah aadhati ko jaanata he, kisaan ko nahin
 There are years of relationships, based on which deals are made
 anjaan aadmi ke paas koi aasaani se maal kharidne nahin jaataa
 From the top, the relationship between the farmer and the jobber is also old, so if the farmer needs a loan at some time, he takes it from the jobber and the jobber cuts it later as commission
 kabhi-kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki kisaan kaa maal nahin bik paaya to vah aadhati ke jimme chhodkar chale jate hai, beshak baad main aadhati oune-paune daam dekar kisaan ko bol detaa he ki uskaa maal itane main hi bika, lekin na bikne se or maal waapas le jane se to acha hi he
 That is why the farmer feels that the goods will be sold only through agents, then how and how much will the prices be reduced with this step? vaise, aapako bataa duun ki pichhali sarkaar ke samay main yojana ayog ke upaadhyaksh montek singh ahaluwalia ne bhi yahi idia rakhaa tha
 The government announced that it will sell potato-onion at cheaper rates through Mobile One in Delhi, these mobile vans will go to the mohallas in Delhi from Friday evening, although it will take time to test its success, but keep in mind that Sheila Dikshit government in Delhi will be such She has been trying before also
 safal ke 380 boothon par aalu or pyaaj kii supplai badhaai jaaegi, jisase badhate daamon par kaabo paaya jayega
 The successful booth i visited told people that no supply has been increased yet, but the supply is already fine
 hamaare yahaan aalu 24-26 ru / kilo or pyaaj 20-22 ru / kilo he, chaliye dekhte hai isse kitna asar padegaa
 To prevent or influence the export of potato and onion, its minimum export price was fixed
 yah kadam pehle bhi samay-samay par uthaae jate rahe hai phir bhi iskaa asar dekhne ke liye hamako intjaar karnaa hoga
 The government has been taking this step before the government will bring 50 lakh tonnes of rice from the government warehouse to the open market, but its response did not show any good, because the rate at which the government used to bring it to the market was not attractive, if the government One can expect good performance only if the rate is kept low
 sarkaar ne jamaakhoron par karrwai karne ke liye kaha he, lekin yah to hameshaa se hi kaha jaataa rahaa he
 By the way, as far as i have news, there is a kind of panic among the traders and this is the effect of Narendra Modi's image, so the report from the mandis of Delhi and Madhya Pradesh says that the traders are not buying much and in Madhya Pradesh The effect of this is that the gram which is called the king of pulses in the country, which is eaten most in the country, has a minimum support price of Rs 3100 / quintal, but that tax By 2000 sold Rs / quintal
 sarkaar vahaan kharid nahin rahi or vyapaaree dehshat main hai isliye nateeja yah he
 Overall, the government is taking steps, but these are the same steps that the previous government has taken or have discussed, although we will have to wait to see its results, but still when ' If there is talk of 'new thinking, new hope', then it would not be wrong to expect a new step from the new government
 aropiyon dwaara jalaai gai unnav dushkarm peedita kii maut ke baad jahaan puure desh main rosh vyaapt he, vahiin unnav police apane usee puraane nirdayee ravaiye par kaayam he
 It has been learned that a woman from Hindupur village, where the Unnao victim was burnt by the accused, alleged on Saturday that the police refused to register her complaint of attempted rape
 kathith taur par police ne mahila se kaha ki jab dushkarm ho uske baad aana, tabhi shikaayat darj hogi
 In the police station, the police said to the woman, 'rape has not happened, when it will come
 'mahila ne bataaya ki kuch maheene pehle gaanv ke hi teen logon ne uske saath dushkarm karne kaa prayaas kiya tha
 The woman said, 'I was going to take my medicine
 tabhi teenon ne mujhe roka or mere kapade khinchne lage
 He also tried to rape me
 ' mahila ne aropiyon kii pahchaan bhi kii
 After this, when she reached the police to complain, the police banished her and asked her to come after the rape
 mahila ne bataaya ki vah teen maheene se thane ke chakkar laga rahi he, lekin kisi ne bhi maamle kii sunwaayee nahin kii
 The woman said, 'after the incident, i called 1090 (women's help line) and they asked me to dial 100, but they again asked me to complain to the Unnao police about the matter
 ' mahila ne aarope lagaaya ki aaropee use shikayrt darj karaane par jaan se maarane kii dhamkee de rahe hai

 soochna praudyogiki mantralay ne 4 november tak whatsap se apana jawaab dene ke liye kaha he
 The Central Government has called this reply after whatsapp has confirmed that Spyware Pegasus was active in India and was also spying on the people here

 However, the company has not told how many Indian people have been compromised through this spyware
 chunki pigasus kaa istemaal koi aam shaks nahin kar saktaa he or ise NSO Group ne sarkaron ke liye banaaya gaya he
 The big question is, who used it to spy on Indian journalists and human rights activists? Or who gave the green signal for its use? This spyware named Pegasus has been in India for a long time and people have been spied from time to time
 isroyal kii NSO Group ne ise saraakaaron ke liye dizin kiya he taaki jarurat padane par company kii sahaayta lekar pigasus ke jariye jasusi kii ja sake

 After a landslide victory in UP, Yogi Adityanath was handed over the chair of CM by BJP
 pehle din se hi siem yogi ection mod main aa gaye the
 a month has passed for the Yogi government in power with the promise of changing UP and removing the exile of development
 is dauraan paanch bade chunavi vaadon par kya pragati hui aaie daalate hai isapar najar
 The first big promise - debt waiver - BJP but PM Modi himself promised during the election meeting that if our government is formed in UP, the debt of farmers will be waived in the first cabinet meeting
 sarkaar banane ke baad yogi cabinet kii pehali baithak 19 din baad hui
 In this meeting, the government waived crop loans of up to one lakh farmers
 kaha gaya ki pehle cabinet baithak main faisle kii shart ke kaaran hi cabinet baithak main deree hui
 The Yogi government waived the loan of 36 thousand crores of farmers
 iske alaava genhu or aalu kii kharid ko lekar bade faisle kiye gaye
 Also, the decision to take the arrears of sugarcane farmers in 14 days was taken in the second cabinet meeting
 doosraa bada vaada- mahila suraksha kakya hua-sapa raaj main mahilaon ke asurakshit hone or upi ke krime capital banane kii baat piem modi or yogi adityanath lagaataar karte rahe or satta main aane par anti romeo daste samet kai vaade puure karne kaa bharosa dilaate rahe
 The Yogi government assumed power in the state on 19 March
 satta badalte hi upi police ne har jile main anti romeo sowod gathit kar diya
 The action of the squad against the miscreants started and the action of the anti-romeo squad came under discussion throughout the state
 skool-collejon ke baahar, parkon main manachale pakade jane lage
 However, action was taken on students and siblings going along with them in many places, which brought this issue into controversy
 siem yogi khud saamne aae
 He praised the work of the anti-romeo squad but also advised that action should not be taken on the couples going on free will
 iske alaava tripal talaak kaa mudda bhi yogi sarkaar ke saamne mahila adhikaron ke liye uthaaya gaya
 CM Yogi compared this to Cheerharan and said that those who are silent on issues like triple divorce are like criminals
 teesraa bada vaada- 24 ghante bijlikya hua-bijepi ke chunavi vaade main 24 ghante bijli dene kaa vaada bhi sabase ahm he
 The Yogi government took swift steps for this soon after coming to power
 yogi sarkaar ne cabinet baithak main faisla kiya ki shaharon main 24 ghante or gaanvon main 18 ghante bijli di jaaegi or disambar 2018 tak sabhi gharon main 24 ghante bijli aapurti sunishchit kii jaaegi
 Apart from this, it was also decided to replace the transformer in 24 hours in cities and 48 hours in villages
 bijli bill par sarcharge bhi yogi sarkaar ne maaf kar diya
 Apart from this, the Yogi government is also working on a long-term energy plan by meeting with the Union Ministry of Power
 chauthaa bada vaada- avaidh boojadkhaanon par taalakya hua-bijepi kaa ek bada chunavi vaada tha upi main avaidh boojadkhaanon par taala lagane kaa
 After changing the government, raids were conducted on slaughterhouses in all places including Agra, Meerut, Allahabad, Lucknow
 iske baad meet kaarobaariyon kii hadtaal bhi hui
 But CM Yogi made it clear that illegal slaughterhouses would not be allowed to run
 siem yogi ne kaha ki boojadkhaanon par supreme court or engiti ke faislon ko lagu kiya jayega
 The fifth big promise - special attention to Bundelkhand and new industry policy - PM Modi said in the election rally that if the BJP government is formed in UP, then 14 years of development will end and UP will be made the engine of development of the country
 
 yogi sarkaar ne bundelkhand ke liye peyajal pariyojna kaa elaan kiya he
 In the first cabinet meeting itself, the Yogi government announced a new industry policy
 iske liye paanch mantriyon kaa samooh banaaya gaya or mantriyon ko duusare rajyon kii udyog niti kaa adhyayan karne ke liye daure par bhi bheja gaya
 Uttar Pradesh has a population of 22 crores i
e
 16 percent of the country's population, but up's share in GDP is only 12 percent
 prati vyakti aay main upi 31wein number par hai
 In UP, 30 per cent are poor, while at the national level this figure is 22 per cent
 jaankaron ke mutabik agar upi main vikaas hota he, to desh kii vikaas dar ek fisadi bad jaaegi
 Time is short for Yogi Sarkar and the challenges are thousand
 yogi sarkaar isi liye pehle din se hi ection mod main najar aa rahi he
 General elections are due in 2019 and for the second innings of Modi, the performance of the BJP government in the country's largest state UP also matters a lot
 is lihaaj se dekha jaae to na sirf modi balki yogi ke liye parform karne ke liye ab bas do saal hi baaki hai
 Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi is currently visiting Amethi and Rae Bareli
 priyanka gandhi yuddh str par chunaav prachaar main jute gai hai
 Priyanka Gandhi, while addressing a street corner in Rae Bareli, attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi fiercely
 priyanka gandhi ne congress kii nitiyon kaa bhi prachaar kiya
 Priyanka Gandhi said that the Congress has promised that if the party comes in government, people in rural areas will be given 10 lakh jobs
 ham satta main aate hi is par kaam karenge
 Attacking demonetisation, Priyanka Gandhi said that when demonetisation was done, you were promised that black money will be returned
 lekin kaala dhan waapas nahin aayaa
 The income of the farmers did not double
 aawaara pashuon kaa choda janaa bhi yahaan samasya bana hua he, lekin ab tak goshaala kaa koi prabandh nahin kiya gaya he
 Priyanka Gandhi has also accused the farmers of distributing the wealth to the industrialists
 unhone kaha ki kisaanon ke paise udyogpatiyon ko baante ja rahe hai
 10,000 crore rupees was distributed to the industrialists
 priyanka gandhi ne kaha ki bijepi kisaan sammaan yojana ek parivaar ke ek sadsy ko keval 2 rupye pratimah de saktaa he
 This is a peasant insult scheme
 bijepi ne keval udyopatiyon kaa karj maaf kiya he
 The main issue of this government is to benefit industrialists
 priyanka gandhi ne kaha, 'jab mere pita(rajeev gandhi) pradhanmantri the, amethi aate rahete the
 Lived with the people of Amethi
 ham bhi unke saath aate the
 We have never lived in a big bungalow in Amethi
 ham gaanvon main jaakar logon se mulaakaat karte the lekin pradhanmantri modi kabhi kisi gaanv nahin jate
 Prime Minister Modi has not visited villages in his parliamentary seat once in the last 5 years
 unhone ek bhi kisaan se mulaakaat nahin kii lekin apane kaarykaal main unhone puri duniya gum lee he

 --rajesh Raj, Noida Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor is soon to be seen on screen with his real-life son Harshvardhan Kapoor for the first time
 yah pehali baar hoga jab real life baap-bete parde par bhi baap-bete kii bhoomika nibhaate najar aaenge
 These two actors are actually seen working together in Abhinav Bindra's biopic film
 abhinav bindra kii byopic film main harshavardhan kapur abhinav kii bhoomika nibhaate najar aaenge or anil kapur abhinav ke pita apjit kaa role karenge
 Anil Kapoor said in a conversation with a newspaper that the news of his refrain from appearing on screen with Harsh for fear of being compared was just a rumor
 aamtaur par jab ek hi parivaar ke do kalakaar saath main parde par najar aate hai to audiyans unhen or unke kaam ko compair karti he
 Anil Kapoor said, "I did not hesitate for a single moment to accept the role
 " anil ne kaha, "meraa betaa bhi mere saath kaam karne ko lekar puri tarah confident he jabaki abhi usne sirf 2 hi filmein kii hai
 "it is known that before this Harshvardhan Kapoor has been seen working in the films Mirzaya and Bhavesh Joshi
 anil ko fakhr he ki unke bete ko bharat ke mahaan sportsman kii byopic ke liye chunaa gaya he
 He said, "my son is going to biopic the sportsman who won the first individual gold medal at the Olympics
" mujhe bhi uske saath kaam karke khushi ho rahi he
 " uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath rajya kii sarkaar ko agle paanch dinon tak gorakhnath mandir se chalaayenge
 Apart from being the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi is also the Peethadhishwar of Gorakhnath Temple in Gorakhpur and till Tuesday he will be seen in the same role
 mandir prabandhan se mili jaankaree ke anusaar, mukhyamantri yogi buudhvaar subah tak gorakhpur main rahenge
 During this period, after worshiping Saptami, Ashtami and Navami of Navaratri, Yogis will lead the traditional victory procession on the day of Dussehra as Gorakshpithadheeshwar
 yahaan se vah nau oktober kii subah lakhanu ke liye ravaanaa honge
 According to the information received from the office, the Chief Minister will reach Champa Devi Park directly from the airport, where Morari will attend the inaugural function of Bapu's Ram Katha
 shanivaar shaam vah gorakhnath mandir main puure vidhi-vidhaan se mahanisha pujan karenge
 Yogi Adityanath will worship the girl in his residence on Monday i
e
 Navratri, and will feed him with his hands by feeding his feet
 navaratri samaapt hone ke baad mangalvaar ko vijaydashami ke din vah subah shrinathi kii puja-archana karenge or dopaher main tilak kaarykram ke baad shaam chaar baje vijay juluus kii aguwai karenge
 The procession will traditionally reach the Mansarovar Ramlila Maidan, where he will perform the tilak of Lord Shri Ram
 vijaydashami ke din shaam saat baje sahabhoj kaarykram yojit hoga
 After this, he will leave for Lucknow on Wednesday morning
 gyaat ho ki gorakhnath mandir main sharadiya navaratri bhavy rup main manaaya jaataa he
 In Shardiya Navratri, Chief Minister Yogi worships the mother by keeping a fast for nine days
 parampara he ki goraksh peethadhishwar ko kalash sthapana ke baad puure navaratri apane awaas main hi nivas karnaa hota he
 Though not possible for Yogi Adityanath, given the responsibility of the Chief Minister's post, he will not leave as long as he stays in the temple
 yogi adityanath (ajay singh bisht) kaa janm devbhumi uttarakhand main 5 june, 1972 ko hua
 He graduated from science
 chaatr jivan main vibhinn rashtravaadi andolanon se vah jude rahe
 Yogi Adityanath was distressed by the distortions of Sanatan Hinduism and the attack on him and for this he agitated and struggled
 gorakhpur sansadeey kshetra kii janata kii maang par varsh 1998 main unhone loksabhaa chunaav ladaa or 26 varsh kii aayu main sabase yuva saansad bane
 Due to daily attendance among the public, annual tour of about 1500 gram sabhas under the parliamentary constituency and programs of Hindutva and development, he was elected five times MP from Gorakhpur parliamentary constituency
 yogi adityanath ne 1998 se 2017 tak bhartiya janata party ke tikat par gorakhpur loksabhaa kshetra kaa pratinidhitiv kiya
 On March 19, 2017, at a meeting of the BJP Legislature Party of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath was elected as the leader of the Legislative Party and assigned to the post of Chief Minister
 20 march ko yogi adityanath ne desh ke sabase bade rajya uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 Yogi is now a big face of Uttar Pradesh BJP
 vah ek aise netaa hai, jinhone hindutv ke mudde par na sirf upra balki puure desh main alag pahchaan banaai he
 The BJP has indirectly sent a message to Hindutva supporters by making him the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 yogi adityanath gorakhnath peeth ke mahant or gorakhpur se chaar baar saansad rahe avaidhyanath ke shishy hai
 Mahant Avaidyanath died in September 2014, but he had declared Yogi Adityanath as his successor
 bharat or pakistan ke patrakaron kaa yah maananaa he ki donon deshon ke bich ke avishvaas or dwipaksheeya sambandhon kii duriyon ko soshal media ke upyog or logon ke bich baatcheet ko badhaakar kam kiya ja saktaa he
 His response came on the last day of the 'social Media Conference' held in Lahore and Karachi under the aegis of the US Consulate
 sammelan main america ke council general wiliam martin ne kaha ki twitor or fasebuk jaise soshal media websiton ne donon deshon ke logon ko vaastavik sthiti ko samajhane main kaaphi madad kii he saath hi usne duniya ke vibhinn deshon ke logon ke bich kii duriyon ko bhi kam kiya he
 He said that India Pakistan can improve relationships through the students' 'exchange program'
 desh kii sabase badi jaanchasibiimen bhrashtachar ke mudde se shuru hui jang abhi tak thami nahin he
 As the matter gets entangled, questions are being raised on the credibility of the CBI
 is bavaal kaa thikra vipaksh ne puri tarah se centre sarkaar par thope diya he, vahiin sarkaar ne ise sibiai kaa andruni maamla bataaya he
 However, the biggest question that arises in the midst of this whole development is what will happen to the CBI, will the questions raised on the image of the CBI be stopped by sending two top officials on leave
 darasal, sibiai ke andar bhrashtachar ke ek maamle ko lekar jo do sheersh ke afasaron main jang shuru hui ab vah khule maidan main he
 Overnight the case has taken a political turn with the way the two officers were sent on leave and the entire team was replaced
 maamle ne liya raajnneetik rangakyonki maamla puri tarah se raajnneetik hone laga he, yahi kaaran he ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi, pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee, dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal samet vipaksh ke kai bade chehron ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or unki sarkaar par sawaal uthaae hai
 Due to which this matter does not appear to be ending easily, the issue may be heard in the assembly elections in five states in the coming days
 sibiai main aise hue badlavasibiai kii maane toalok vermake khilaaf maamle kii jaanch sivisi kii najar main chal rahi he
 At the same time, no change has been made in the investigation team
 team main alok verma nahin balki antarim diarectornageshwar ravako report karegi
 However, on Wednesday itself, the entire team investigating the case related to Nageswara Rao Nerakesh Asthanas was changed
 sibiai kii kaman sanbhaalane ke kuch hi ghanton main unhone 13 adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa yaa jimmedaari main badlaav kaa aadesh diya
 The rest of the cases will not make any difference, apart from which the CBI has other cases, their investigation will continue in the same way
 unpar kisi tarah kaa koi fark nahin padegaa
 However, the way the controversy caught fire, the government has become cautious
 sutron kii maane, to sarkaar ab pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ke kaamkaaj par bhi nazar banaae hue he taaki koi anhoni naa ho paae
 What is the matter? It is worth mentioning that the CBI has charged against Rakesh Asthana (special Director) and many others for allegedly bribing the case of a person named Satish Sana related to the investigation of meat trader Moin Qureshi
 FIR was registered
 iske ek din baad dspi devendra kumaar ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 After this arrest, on Tuesday, CBI registered a case of extortion and forgery on Asthana
 sibiai ke nideshak alok verma or vishesh nideshak rakesh asthana ke bich chhidi is jang ke bich, centre ne satarkta ayog kii sifarish par donon adhikariyon ko chuttee par bhej diya
 And Joint Director Nageswara Rao was made interim director of CBI
 charge lene ke saath hi nageshwar raav ne maamle se jude 13 anya adhikariyon kaa transfar kar diya
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has reached Harnampur village
 yogi yahaan par dalit samudaay ke logon ke saath khaanaa khaaenge
 During this, around 150 people will dine together
 haal hi main saharanpur hinsa ke baad upi sarkaar kii chhavi anti-dalit ke taur par bani thi, yahi kaaran he ki ab yogi apni chhavi ko sudhaarna chaah rahe hai
 Yogi praised Baba Saheb during his address where Yogi read songs in praise of Baba Saheb
 yogi ne kaha ki vah aadhunik bharat ke shilpkaar the, unhone bharat ke samvidhan ko banaaya
 Yogi said that during the 2014 elections people chose Narendra Modi as their leader, PM Modi has promised that he will uplift the poor
 centre or rajya sarkaar kaa gunganyogi ne kaha ki centre sarkaar ne garibon kii jameen ke liye soyal health card kii shuruyaat kii, vahiin rajya sarkaar ne kisaanon ke karj ko maaf kii
 During this, Yogi said that our government has decided to free the roads of the entire state
 hamaari sarkaar koi VIP gaanv yaa saadhaaran gaanv main bhedbhaav nahin karegi
 Yogi said that our government has also launched a big campaign against the land mafia
 siem yogiis dauraan jameen par baithkar hi khaanaa khaaenge, haalanki unke liye ek alag se aasaan lagaaya jayega
 It is being said that food will include lentils, rice, roti, aloo parwal vegetables
 vahiin yogi kii pasandida lowki kii sabji bhi isamen shaamil hogi
 In the pandal where the yogi will eat, there will be no fan or AC installed

 But it also has a limit and moderation is at an end
 chini raksha mantralay ke pravaktaa ne ulte bharat par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki bharat ko is bhram se khud ko nikaal dena chahie ki der karne se doklam samasya kaa hal ho jayega
 Threatening Chinese military spokesman said that no country can take the land of China
 chini sena apane bhubhag or samprabhutaa kii raksha ke liye puri tarah sakasham he
 For the past 50 days, there has been a continuous threat from China in the face of the ongoing tension between india-china-bhutan near Sikkim sector and tensions between indo-chinese forces
 haal hi main bharat main sthit chini duutavas kii ore se 15 pej kaa bayaan jari kiya gaya tha jisamen doklam main bharat kii moujdugi ko galat tehraane kii koshish kii gai thi
 China has earlier tried to provoke the situation in Beijing by foreign embassies, representatives of the permanent member countries of the Security Council and G20 representatives by presenting fake evidence against India in Doklam
 bharat kaa kya he stand?guuruuvaar ko videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne rajyasabha main china ke maamle par bayaan diya or kaha ki yuddh koi vikalp nahin
 india-china and Bhutan will resolve the matter through negotiations

 Kanwar Pal Singh Gill, a police officer known as Super Cop, died on Friday
 82 varsh kii avasthaa main dilli ke gangaaraam aspataal main unhone aakhri saans lee
 15 point-1 underlining Gill's personality
 supercop capies gil kaa puraa naam kanvar paal singh gil he
 In 1958, he joined the Indian Police Service at the age of 24 years
 gil ko assam-meghalaya kader mila
 Gill had to say that he chose the assam-meghalaya cadre to work independently
 agar wo apane grih rajya punjab ko chunate to raajnneetik hastkshep kii vajah se swatantra rup se kaam karnaa sambhav nahin ho paata
 2
 punjab main aatankwaad ke khatme or apni aakraamak nitiyon ke liye capies gil ko khub charchaa mili
 Interestingly, Gill was not part of any encounter during his decade-long service in Assam
 3
 Gill was also famous for his fondness for branded whiskey
 1960 se 70 ke dashak main tamaam vaicharik matbhedon ke baavjood ol assam student union (AASU) ke varishton ke saath aksar unhen whisky ke paig lagaate hue dekha ja saktaa tha
 4
 assam ke kamrup jile main unki kathor nitiyon kii vajah se capies gil ko 'kamrup police suparitendent gil' kaha jaataa tha
 5
 shilong kii prakritik khubsuurati ke mohpash main bandhe capies gil north east ke hill toun main ek cottage bananaa chaahate the
 However, after his posting in the Border Security Force in 1984, he found it difficult to pursue this idea
 baad main north east se dooriyaan badhane kii vajah se unhone shimla main ek cottage banaaya, jahaan vah har saal apni garmiyaan bitaate
 6
 1988 main grih sachiv kii mejabani ek party kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 In this party, Gill was accused of abusing a senior female IAS officer
 vah us samay vitt sachiv ke rup main kaam kar rahi thim
 Gill was convicted after 17 years in the case

 7
 2008 main capies gil kii aguwai vaale bhartiya hockey mahasang main bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke baad bhartiya olympic sangh ne iechaef ko suspend kar diya
 Suresh Kalmadi of the Olympic Association had then said that KPS Gill has full respect, but this is not a private matter
 8
 In 1989, KPS Gill was awarded the Padma Shri for his contribution to the civil service
 9
 After the 2002 Gujarat riots, then Chief Minister Narendra Modi appointed KPS Gill as the state's security advisor
 gil ne hinsa se nipatane ke liye punjab se 1000 atirikt vishesh prashikshit police waalon kii niyukti kii sifarish kii
 Gill later received full credit for overcoming the Gujarat violence

 10
 2006 main naksaliyon se nipatane ke liye chhattisgarh sarkaar ne gil se suraksha salaahkaar ke taur par madad maangi
 In 2007, 55 policemen were killed in a Naxalite attack
 is par gil ne kaha ki yah maamla police bal main vyaapt khaamiyon kii vajah se he
 The policies of the government were to leave the area of tribals and because of this, the Naxalites got a chance to build their stronghold
 unhone kaha ki naksaliyon ko khatm karne main samay lagegaa, lekin ise jeeta ja saktaa he
 11
 haalanki bahut baad main rajasthan patrika ko die ek intervyuu main capies gil ne bataaya ki chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri ne unase kaha tha ki tankhwaah lo or baith ke maje karo
 12
 capies gil foltlins naam kii patrika prakashit karte the or institute of kanflict management (isiem) naam kii sanstha bhi chalaate the
 Gill has also written a book called 'the Knights of Falsehood'
 13
 KPS Gill spoke candidly and at times his statements would also give rise to controversies
 beant singh hatyakand par pratikriya dete hue gil ne ek baar kaha tha ki punjab ke raajnneetik maahaul or vikaas ko jo nuksaan pahunchaa he
 Seeing him, Balwant Singh is not entitled to Rajoana Rahm
 14
 In March 2008, the Indian hockey team failed to qualify for the Olympics for the first time since 1928
 bhartiya hockey mahasang ke 11 upaadhyakshon main se ek narendra batra ne ise asafalataa qaraar dete hue apane pad se istipha de diya
 15
 hockey team kii asafalataa ke liye batra ne gil ke taanaashaahee bhare ravaiye ko jimmedaar tehraaya or bhartiya hockey mahasang ke sabhi sadasyon ko istipha dene ko kaha
 Gill retaliated, calling these people 'professional mourners' and said that we do not have any coffee machine to get immediate results
 kendriya khel mantri em es gil ke baad dilli kii mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne bhi adhuri padi rashtramandal khel pariyojnaon ko samay par puraa karne kii ishwar se guhaar lagaai he
 On the completion of many basic projects so far, Dixit hoped that by the grace of God, his government would complete these works before October 3
 unhone kaha, ‘lagaataar baari barish ho rahi he jisase hamaara kaam prabhavit hua he
 If the rain stops and the sun comes out then we will finish all our work by 10 September
 anyathaa hamen samaysima badhaani hoga
 But we are confident that by the grace of God we will complete everything from October 3
 ’isi maheene gil ne bhi rajyasabha main charchaa ke dauraan kaha tha, ‘bharat main vishwaas rakhie, bharat vahaan pahunch jayega kyonki ishwar hamaare saath he

 Finance Minister P
 chidambaram desh kii rajdhani ke madhya main sthit niyantrak or mahalekha pareekshak (sieji) ke bhavy mukhyalay main mahalekhakaaron ke ek sammelan ko sambodhit karne vaale the
 In an informal moment of laughter between him and CAG Vinod Rai before the program, the Finance Minister said that he was regretting choosing Rai for the post of the country's top auditor in January 2008
 is niyukti ko manjuuri pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne di thi
 At the same conference, President Pranab Mukherjee said that Rai has made a change to take "a larger view of the routine audit like a routine", but he also warned the CAG to move beyond the limits
 is par raay kii sargarbhit tippanee thiru ‘‘ham sarkaar ke liye chiyar leader (tali bajaane vaale) kii bhoomika nahin nibhaa sakate
 "the Prime Minister was also invited to this conference, but he thought it appropriate not to know
 11 november ko pradhanmantri karyaalay main rajyamantri ve
 Narayanasamy indicated that the government wants to censor CAG by making it a multi-member organization
 ab yah baat saaf ho chuki thi ki 1972 batch ke kerala kader ke is iees afasar ne sarkaar kii naak main dam karke rakh diya he
 It was a period of activism of the CAG after a period of judicial activism
 raay ne 2012 main khajaane ko chuunaa lagane vaale ghotaalon kii kai reportein jari karke janata ke paise ko barbaad karne par sawaal uthaakar or kushasan ke kai maamalon ko darj karsarkaar ko saansat main daalaa he
 The CAG placed its three reports on the floor of the Parliament on 17 August — on the allocation of coal blocks, about the Delhi airport, and about ultra mega power projects
 koyala block aavanton vaali report main kaha gaya ki isamen bada ghotaalaa hua he, jisase sarkari khajaane ko 1
 86 lakh crore Rs
 kaa chuunaa laga he
 In this case, even the Prime Minister came under the charge because he was in charge of the Ministry of Coal at the time of allocation
 manmohan ne ghate ke is aankade ko ‘‘saaf taur se vivaadaaspad” bataaya or is report main ‘‘kai binduon par khamiyaan” pain
 Opinions from Delhi School of Economics and Harvard University could answer the figures in the same manner but they did not get involved in this controversy
 dilli hawaondde ke bare main pesh report main kaha gaya ki naagarik uddyan mantralay ne boli kii sharton kaa ulanghan kar jiemr ke netritv vaale dely international airport limited ko 3,415 karod ru

 teesri report main reliance power ko boli ke baad di jane vaali riyaayaton kii jaankaree di gai thi or isamen kaha gaya tha ki anil ambani ke netritv vaali is company ko 29,033 karod ru
 Has been given an unfair advantage
 yani sieji kaa audit tantra privet sector main ghus gaya or usne desh ke korporate valrd ko hilaa diya
 Rai has been demanding a change in the Audit Act, 1971 since September 2009 so that the CAG has the right to investigate any institution that deals with the use of public funds
 haalanki, sarkaar ne raay kii baat kii andekhi kar di lekin ve aanshik rup se hi sahi, apane tareeke se companiyon kii audit bhi karne lage
 For example, Delhi Airport is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) between GMR and the Airports Authority of India (AAI)
 sieji ne eei ke saudon kii jaanch kar iske audit kaa tarika nikaal liya
 The government is waiting for May 23, 2013 when Rai will turn 65 and complete his term
 unke baad kisi dabbu vyakti kii niyukti kii ja sakati he
 But Rai believes that the image of the organization has improved
 unka kahana he ki yah adhikariyon par nirbhar hoga ki vyavastha sucharu tareeke se chalati rahe, mukhiya chaahe koi bhi ho
 He is waiting for his accounting role to end, so that he can wear his tennis shoes and mountaineering boots — both of his favorite activities
 madhya pradesh kii rajdhani bhopal main beete 24 ghante main do alag-alag ghatnaon main ek bhaajapa kaaryakarta sahit chaar logon kii kathith rup se goli maar kar hatya kar di gai
