 There should be chaos in the state where more than 70 thousand posts are stuck in the court

 Sharad Yadav was left rubbing his nose, Nitish did not give the Rajya Sabha
 san 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main guru jorge ke saath aisa hi hua tha
 Now Sharadji is afraid that somewhere in Madhepura, the number three fields may be put up, because both the 'geography' and 'history' of Madhepura have changed and the new Yadav kunars are beating the talis wearing saffron safa
 aise main darshanik bhav apanaate hue sharadji loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladane kaa elaan kar den, to koi aashcharya nahin
 The 2016 Rajya Sabha may be expected
 xxrep 4 ' sharadji, baaji usee samay chook gaye the, jab nitish ne bijepi se naata tod liya tha
 If he wanted at that time, he could have made a CM of his choice by revolting in JD (U)
 ab unke paas nitish ko dene yaa nitish se chhinane ke liye khaas bachaa nahin he
 But the Yadav skull has been doing wonders even for the last 40 years without mass support

 Shivanand knows that in Buxar he will be crushed between Jagadananda and Lalmuni Chaubey

 Baba will not get votes in his name and cannot bring donations
 enke singh fund rager the, lekin is baar unka seth, modi-modi jaap kar rahaa he
 In such a situation, their usefulness has not survived and in anyway JD (U) is a tota of 'worthy' Rajputs to contest elections
 so unhen baankaa se ladane ke liye bolaa gaya hai, jahaan se ve putul singh ke saamne shahid hone ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Anyway, the two families have a sweet relationship (although this does not mean much in politics)

 In Parliament, Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid has said that he will not be punished
 italy ke donon aaropee nausainikon ke bharat lautne ke liye supreme court kii samay seemaa shuukravaar ko hi khatm ho rahi he
 Both navies arrived in India by special plane on Friday
 isi ke saath bharat kii yah badi kootnithik jeet hui he
 The Italian government has said that it will send two of its marines facing charges of killing two Indian fishermen back to India
 italy kaa yah elaan uske videsh mantralay ke pehle ke faisle se thik ulat he jisamen kaha gaya tha ki donon aaropee nausainik bharat waapas nahin bheje jaaenge
 It is noteworthy that both the marines, named Massimiliano Latour and Salvatore Zirone, were allowed to go home to vote in the Italian elections but on condition that they would return to India by 22 March to face trial
 pichley saal farvari main donon marinon ne kerala ke samudr tat ke paas do machuaaron kii kathith taur par goli markar hatya kar di thi
 Italy argues that during an international anti-piracy operation, bullets were fired in the international waters and therefore Italy should have jurisdiction in this matter
 isse pehle congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne italy par apane gusse kaa izhaar karte hue kaha tha ki italy ko do bhartiya machuaaron kii hatya ke aaropee apane do nausainikon ko lekar supreme court se kiya gaya vaada puraa karnaa chahie
 Sonia said this to the party mps in the Congress Parliamentary Party meeting
 supreme court ne 14 march ko kaha tha ki italy ke rajdoot uski anumati ke bagaiyr desh chhodkar nahin ja sakate
 In another order issued on Monday, the court asked the administration to ensure that Italian Ambassador Daniel Mensini does not leave the country
 supreme court kaa aadesh italy dwaara apane nau sainikon ko bharat bhejne se inkaar kiye jane ke baad aayaa tha, jinke khilaaf yahaan do bhartiya machuaaron kii hatya ke silsile main mukadmaa chal rahaa he
 The court allowed the nine accused accused to go to their country for general elections
 tab bharat main italy ke rajdoot mensini ne court ko bharosa dilaayaa tha ki aaropee nausainik chunaav main bhaag lene ke baad yahaan laut aaenge

 Public Works Minister CM Udasi and Energy Minister Shobha Karandlaje submitted their resignations to Chief Minister Jagdish Shettar
 uske kuch hi ghante baad ye donon 11 anya vidhayakon ke saath apana istipha saunpane ke liye vidhansabha adhyaksh ke karyaalay gaye
 When all these mlas went to resign, neither Assembly Speaker KG Bopaiah nor Assembly Secretary Omprakash were present
 vidhayakon ne kareeb ek ghante tak intjaar kiya, uske baad naaraaz yediurppa vahaan pahunche or unhone kaha ki shettar sarkaar alpamat main aa gai he
 Bopaiah is out of town
 uttejit vidhayakon ne kaha ki vidhansabha sachivalay kaa koi bhi adhikari yaa to unke tyaagptr sweekaar karen yaa ve likhakar den ki ve tyaagptr sweekaar karne ke liye adhikrut nahin hai
 Joint Secretary of Legislative Assembly Jayatirtha Galali told the mlas, i cannot accept it as Joint Secretary
 jab vidhansabha adhyaksh hon, kripaya, tab aaie or apane tyaagptr dijie
 Yeddyurappa, who recently formed the Karnataka Janata Party (KJP), said the Shettar government has come in a minority
 unhen satta main bane rahane kaa naitik adhikaar nahin he
 He should stop his journey and return to the city and resign
 yediurppa ne bopaiya ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya he or kaha ki unhen vidhayakon ke istife ke bare main itlla kar diya gaya tha or vah yatra par chale gaye
 The former chief minister said, this is a shameless government
 shettar ko rajyapal se milanaa chahie or apni sarkaar kaa istipha dena chahie
 We will tell the Governor that this government cannot remain in power, because it has come in a minority
 tippaniyan Shettar, who went on an official visit to northern Karnataka, has confirmed that two ministers have resigned
 udaasi ne kaha ki ve yediurppa kaa samarthan karne vaale vidhayakon evam mantriyon ke prati shettar ke rukh se dukhi the or ab kejeepi ke majboot banane kaa samay aa gaya he
 Ever since Yeddyurappa left the BJP to form his own KGP in December last year, Shettar has been hovering over the Cabinet indefinitely
 bijepi ke purv kaddavar netaa ne baar baar sarkaar ko uske sthayitv ko lekar anguli dikhaai he or 20-30 bijepi vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa daawa kiya he
 Rejecting the threat to his government, Shettar said that he would present the budget on 8 February
 may main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav se pehle yah antim bajet he
 The mlas who have offered resignation are CM Udasi, Nehru Olekar, Tipaswamy, BP Harish, h Halappa, Suresh Gowda Patil, Shobha Karandlaje, SI Chikkangoudar, Suresh, g Shivanna, Chandrappa, VS Patil and Basavraj Patil Attur

 jab ye sabhi vidhayak istipha dene gaye, tab na to vidhansabha adhyaksh keji bopaiya or na hi vidhansabha sachiv omprakash maujuud the
 The legislators waited for about an hour, after which the angry Yeddyurappa reached there and said that the Shettar government had come in a minority
 bopaiya shahar se baahar hai
 The agitated mlas said that any officer of the Legislative Assembly Secretariat should either accept his resignation or give in writing that he is not authorized to accept the resignation
 vidhansabha ke sanyukt sachiv jayatirth galaali ne vidhayakon se kaha, bataur sanyukt sachiv main ise sweekaar nahin kar saktaa
 Please come and submit your resignation when the Speaker is the Speaker
 haal hi main karnataka janata party (kegepi) banane vaale yediurppa ne kaha, shettar sarkaar alpamat main aa gai he
 They do not have the moral right to remain in power
 unhen apni yatra rokkar shahar main laut aana chahie or istipha de dena chahie
 Yeddyurappa has also targeted Bopaiah and said that he had been informed about the resignation of the mlas and he went on the yatra
 purv mukhyamantri ne kaha, yah nirlajj sarkaar he
 Shettar should meet the governor and resign his government
 ham rajyapal ko bataaenge ki yah sarkaar satta main bani nahin rah sakati, kyonki yah alpamat main aa gai he
 The comments uttari karnataka kii sarkari yatra par gaye shettar ne is baat kii pushti kii he ki do mantriyon ne istipha diya he
 Udasi said that he was saddened by Shettar's attitude towards the mlas and ministers supporting Yeddyurappa and now the time has come for the strengthening of the KGP
 jab se yediurppa ne pichley saal disambar main apni kejeepi banane ke liye bijepi chodi thi, tab se shettar mantrimandal par anischitata ke badal mandara rahe hai
 The former BJP stalwart has repeatedly shown the government a finger for its stability and claimed the support of 20-30 BJP mlas

 hyderabad kii rahane vaali sunita krishnan (40) nevydeos ke sahare gunahagaaronko sajaa dilaane kaa bidaa uthaaya he
 Such culprits, who might even be called humans, are insensitive to humanity
 pichley do maheene main unhen alag-alag websiton par maujuud rape kii ghatnaon ke ghrunit video mili hai
 The shocking thing was that despite the complaints of the videos, no police took any action against the culprits of all these video clips, because most of the girls, who were the victims of their lust, were gang rape gangsters in these clips
 Could not muster the courage to go to the police with complaint
 saamaajik kaaryakarta sunita krishnan ne balaatkaar kii shikaar ladakiyon kii madad karne vaala enjio chalaa kar or ab 'shem da repist campan' yani balaatkaari ko sharmasaar karne kaa abhiyaan chalaa kar raaton-raat jaise puure system ko hilaa diya he
 Sunita received 90 such video clips from across the country in which gang-rape incidents were captured
 sunita ne supreme court ke chif justise ko ek patr likhaa or saath main ek pen drive main wo nau video bhi bheje jo insaaniyat ke saath-saath desh ke kanoon ko bhi dhokhaa de rahe the
 After seeing those, the highest court of the country has also come into the can
 gangrape ke in alag-alag videomen aise anginat gunahagaaron ke chehre kaid hai, jo alag-alag jagahon par ladakiyon ke saath jyaadati karte or unki har cheekh or har takalif par hansate hue najar aa rahe hai
 Seeing these video clips, the Supreme Court has asked the government what the cyber cell is doing in different states, who are roaming freely despite the presence of such videos
 supreme court ne desh ke adishnal solicytor general ko bulawaaya or rajyon ke sibar cell kii kahili par jawaab talab karte hue maamle ko desh kii sabase badijaanch agency sibiaiki hawaale kar diya
 Sunita had won her first victory in the battle
 lekin use duusari jeet tab mili, jab sibiai ne aise hi ek video ko trek karte hue odisha kii rajdhani bhubaneshwar se ek aise builder ko dhar dabocha, jisane ek ladki ke saath gang karte hue apane ek saathi kii madad se use shoot kiya tha
 But after this, Sunita was shocked when people sent 90 different video clips of her in the hope of justice in which countless rapists in different parts of the country were seen doing excessively with different girls
 
 ab khud sunita ko ye samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki akhir itane saare balaatkaariyon se nipate to kaise nipate
 However, the matter is with the apex court and justice is yet to be expected

 notebandi par kalaadhan ko roak paane main pradhanmantri narendra modi par bhale hi asafal hone ke aarope lagane lage hon lekin, ab sarkaar ne arabiai ke madhyam se phir apana master stroke khelaa he
 With the introduction of demonetisation, where the government expected that around 70 per cent of the money would be deposited back in the banks and the rest would not come due to black money, according to the latest figures released by the RBI, the economy so far 80% of some cash present in the bank has been deposited in banks
 bainkon main itani badi taadaad main puraane 1000 or 500 ke note jamaa hone ke baad sarkaar ke maathe par shikan aane lagi or sarkaar ko bhi yahi lagane laga ki is mudde par sarkaar kaa daanv kahin ulta to nahin padaa gaya
 To end the problems faced by the people, PM Narendra Modi kept announcing from all the forums that in only 50 days, the government would control the situation and people would not have to stand in lines outside banks and atms
 vaastavikta main aisa hua nahin
 People are still engaged in the lines and these lines start coming out of banks and atms at dawn itself

 It is worth mentioning that in this historic step of the government, Bhagat received from the brokers of the officials and employees of the banks has been heavily on the intention of the government and in the last 15 days, in the investigation of the agencies of local police, CBI, ED etc
 in many cities of the country, crores of crores of rupees Black money has been recovered

 The comments arabiai ne mangalvaar 13 disambar 2016 ko sabhi bainkon ko chitthee likhakar kaha he ki bainkon se dallalon dwaara kalaadhan ko safed kiye jane ke jo prakaran saamne aa rahe hai uske baad yah jaruri ho jaataa he ki bank 8 november se 30 disambar 2016 ke bich ke bainkon main lage sisitivi footage ko surakshit rakhen
 In this letter, RBI has said that through these CCTV footage, the investigating agencies want to uncover the nexus between banks and brokers
 notebandi ke lagu karne ke saath hi jahaan sarkaar ko ummid thi ki kareeb 70 fisadi paisa waapas bainkon main jamaa ho jayega or baaki kaa kalaadhan hone kii vajah se saamne nahin aayega vahiin, arabiai ne jo taaja aankade jari kiye hai, unke anusaar abhi tak arthvyavastha main maujuud kuch nakad kaa 80 fisadi bainkon main jamaa ho chukaa he
 After depositing old 1000 and 500 notes in such a large number of banks, wrinkles started coming on the forehead of the government and the government also felt that the government's stake on this issue was not reversed

 aam aadmi party (aap) se naaraaz chal rahe netaa kumaar vishwaas ne aaj dilli hoicourt main kaha he ki kendriya mantri arun jetali ke khilaaf unhone arvind kejariwal ke bayanon ko doharaaya tha
 Vishwas, who was present in the court, told Justice Rajiv Sahai Andla that before making any statement or apologizing to Jaitley, he wanted to know if Kejriwal had lied in the past
 vah yah bhi jaananaa chaahate hai ki kya kejariwal ne jetali se maafee maangane se pehle jhooth bolaa tha yaa unke maafee maangane kii vajah jhooth jaisi he
 The court was confidently directed to remain present on 26 April to clarify whether he wanted to cross-examine Jaitley in the defamation case
 kejariwal or aap ke chaar netaa raghav chadda, sanjay singh, ashutosh or deepak vaajapeyi ke jetali se maafee maangane ke baad vishwaas ab ekmaatr aise vyakti bache hai jinke khilaaf manahani kaa mukadmaa chal rahaa he
 Significantly, the union minister had filed a defamation suit of Rs 10 crore against these people
 jetali ne kejariwal or aap ke 5 netaaon ke khilaaf disambar 2015 main ek manahani kaa mukadmaa daayar kiya tha
 These leaders accused Jaitley of committing financial irregularities while presiding over the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA)
 bhaajapa netaa ne sabhi aaropon kaa khandan kiya tha
 Advocate Manik Dogra, appearing for Jaitley, refused to accept the conviction that he had followed the leaders of his party
 dogra ne kaha ki purv main aarope lagaate samay unhone dastavej dekhne kaa daawa kiya tha
 Dogra said, 'he can no longer say that he said the same thing as other people
 ’ unhone kaha ki vishwaas ko bhi anya logon kii tarah hi bina shart maafee maangani chahie
 Asked by the judge about any difficulty in apologizing, Vishwas said in Hindi in the court that he is saddened for any loss or damage done to Jaitley but what statement should be made to settle the case They need more time to make decisions

 Former Chief Minister J
 jayalalita ke guzar jane ke thik ek saal baad, chennai ke poyas garden main unke padosi rahe 'superstar' rajnikant ne raajnneeti main apane kadam rakhane kaa elaan kar diya
 Rajinikanth, affectionately called Talaiva (boss) on the eve of New Year at the end of the week-long meetings with his film fans, announced that he wanted to bring change and give Tamil Nadu a facelift
 apni trademark alahada style main unhone kaha, ''main raajnneeti main pravesh karuunga
 The current situation needs it
 agar ab main yah faisla nahin karuunga to main logon ko niraash karuunga or isaki glani mujhe hameshaa pareshaan karti rahegi
 i want a patron, not a cadre
 main in sangrakshakon kii nigaraanee karuunga
 "if Rajinikanth's decision is judged on the basis of the time of its announcement, it can be said that he has presented his entry into politics with great intelligence
 ''kya ve aaenge, yaa nahin aaenge? hawa main ye sari baaten chalati rahi hai,'' darasal raajnneeti main unke pravesh kaa sawaal 1996 se hi sabake jehan main rahaa he
 Now ending this question forever, he announced, "my entry into politics is now fixed
" sthitiyon se main iske liye majaboor hua hum
 He then announced his support to the dmk-led opposition and thus ended the aiadmk's five-year long disputed tenure
 unke, ''ab ishwar bhi tamilnadu ko nahin bachaa saktaa'' vaale bayaan ne logon ko phir se jayalalita ko chunane ke khilaaf aagaah kiya tha
 Even then, people were wondering if they were really preparing to enter politics
 lekin tab rajnikant ne kadam peeche khinch liye the
 He reconciled with Jayalalithaa, kept distance from the rest of the leaders and then went to her solitude
 uske ikkis saal baad unki rajnatik mahatvakankshaayen phir jaag uthi hai
 This opportunity also seems to be perfect when the AIADMK is going through a difficult phase due to three clear factions and the DMK is also in its separate transition
 udhar apane boote na to bhaajapa or na hi congress dravid partiyon ko chunauti dene kii haalat main hai
 Despite this, the challenge before this film star is huge because he has not emerged from the nursery of Dravidian politics in Tamil Nadu
 lekin rajnikant ko ek laabh bhi he—ve logon ke vishwaas ke sangrakshak ke taur par vot maang rahe hai, jaise mukhyamantri banane vaale tamil cinema ke baaki sitaron ne kiya tha
 Clearly, Tailava has jumped into the ground by relying on his public appeal
 unhone aisa abhas diya he ki ve rajnatik shunya ko bharne ke liye maidan main koode hai, apni kisi mahatvakanksha ko aage badhaane ke liye nahin
 It is also important that he has not clarified his political outlook
 nape-tule shabdon main unhone apane utsaahi prashansakon kii lambii qatari ko kaha he ki ve unke sanket dene tak yaa phir agle vidhansabha chunaavon ke elaan tak raajnneeti kii baaten karne se bachein
 However, his fans were disappointed that he did not announce his party's name
 yah digar baat he ki neeli, safed or laal pattiyon ke saath bich main sitare vaala unke fain club kaa jhanda rajnikant kii tasviir ke saath ooncha laharaata najar aane laga he
 His huge posters have also been strewn all over the state

 Rajinikanth has indicated that he will stay on top of these
 unhone vaada kiya he ki ve raajnneeti ko us jati or dharmik punarutthan se pare le jaaenge jo haal ke varshon main rajya main dekhne ko mila he
 Political expert n
 satiya murti kehete hai, ''unke (rajnikant) paksh main yah dharna he ki jayalalita ke nidhan or dramuk netaa em
 Karunanidhi's critical illness has created a political void
 lekin bas itnaa hi
 They have no party to identify, no policy to pursue, no organizational strength to inherit and no haste is felt to collect all these things even on this occasion
 ve ise bade halke main le rahe hai jo aam taur par desh main kahin bhi matadaataaon ke gale se neeche nahin utarataa
 It is true that in Tamil Nadu, a void has arisen in the case of leaders emerging from the film world and succeeding in politics
 alabatta, rajnikant kaamyaab hote hai yaa nahin lekin yah tay he ki tamilnadu main ek aise netaa ke rup main mahatvapurn badlaav dekhne ko milegaa jo ishwar or dharm main apni nishtha saarvajanik rup se vyakt karata he
 Even earlier, on the question of entering politics, he used to say that it is in the hands of God
 is lihaaj se jab ve antat raajnneeti ke maidan main chalaang lagaayenge to dharm or aadhyatmikta ko mukhyadhara ke rajnatik vichaar banaakar ve dravid raajnneeti ke raste se saaf taur par alag hi chalenge
 His ability to reach out to the common man with the skill of easy communication in this direction will be one of his strengths
 ab 67 saal ke ho chuke rajnikant kisi jaldbaaji main najar nahin aate
 Anyway, he has been known to go to the Himalayas to take spiritual gaps from the film environment
 unhone jaahir kiya, ''aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle (jo 2021 main hone hai), main sahi samay par ek rajnatik party kii shuruyaat karuunga or ham sabhi 234 siton par chunaav ladenge
 "he" promised a true, straightforward, transparent and clean politics in which there would be no community or religious discrimination
 '' vah 'aadhyatmik' raajnneeti hogi, jiske bare main unhone baad main spasht kiya ki vah ''nyyochit or naitik mulyon'' vaali raajnneeti hogi
 Rajinikanth is very pious and his friends in the film industry indicate that he believes in doing good
 logon ko puri eemaandaaree kaa yakeen dilaane ke liye unhone kaha ki agar ve ab tak anaam apni party ke ghoshit kiye jane vaale vaadon ko puraa karne main naakaam rahete hai to ve satta main aane ke teen saal baad istipha de denge
 His strategy-making team is currently working on more intuitive issues, such as perceived uncertainty in the AIADMK camps, alleged lack of DMK cadre strength and non-impacting Tamil Nadu elections in a big way as a 'deciding factor'
 Potential churn in a strong share of committed and first-time voters, etc
 lekin ek baat saaf he ki ve dravid vichaardhaara se sidhi takkar lene ko taiyaar hai
 His speech, equipped with references drawn from the Bhagavad-gītā, indicated that he would not give himself a chance to be perceived by Dravidian politics as a more modest novice
 naastikta ko badhaava dete hue dravid vichaarak periyar i

 So it is no surprise that the BJP was the first party to welcome the superstar's entry into politics
 rajnikant kaa rukh bhaajapa or sangh ke kaanon ke liye sangeet sareekha tha
 Their effort will be to increase their brotherhood, due to which the BJP should leave the aiadmk's position before the next Lok Sabha elections and take Rajinikanth's party to the NDA
 is tarah se rajnikant kaa pradhanmantri narendra modi or party pramukh amit shah ke saath pehle se athmiya rishta or pragadh ho jayega
 Modi has been in regular contact with Rajinikanth especially since becoming Prime Minister
 modi rajnikant ko 'acha mitra' maanate hai or abhinayta kaa kahana he ki piem unke 'khubhachintak' hai
 Ever since he became Prime Minister in 2014, the BJP has been trying hard to take Rajinikanth with him
 us saal navaratri ke dauraan party kii rajya adhyaksh tamilisai saundarrajan unke chennai sthit ghar gaye jab rajnikant khud shooting ke liye kahin baahar the
 He had put the idea in front of the superstar's wife Lata at that time to support the party
 phir modi ne, jo loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle khud rajnikant se mil chuke the, disambar 2014 main shuddh tamil main rajnikant ko janmdin kii badhai twit kii thi
 On top of all this, the NDA government honored him with the Padma Vibhushan in 2016
 rajya main mahaj teen fisadi vot hissedari vaali bhaajapa unhen chunavi saathi banaakar un par usee tarah sawari karne kii koshish kar rahi he jis tarah congress ne dramuk or annadramuk ke saath kii thi
 This could be a win-win situation for the BJP, as the AIADMK is on the decline and Rajinikanth's appeal is in all castes
 lekin rajnikant kii pehali praathamikta patibadgh vot bank banane kii koshish hogi
 They have instructed their fan clubs to start recruits in their areas
 ve fain klbon ko aadhaar banaakar soshal media ke jariye yuva peedi or pehali baar vaale votaron ko jodgaye kii koshish karenge
 In the 24 hours following his announcement, his website received one million hits and 300,000 registrations
 ye samarthak or club ke sadsy unke kor vot bank honge
 But these account for only 15 per cent of the total electorate, which is more than the 10 per cent votes Vijaykanth's DMDK received in 2009
 rajnikant or bhaajapa, donon ke liye yah kismat kii baat hogi jab tii

 The emergence of Dinakaran as a trump card will further increase instability in the AIADMK
 annadramuk main sankat badha to nateeja yah bhi ho saktaa he ki vidhansabha chunaav 2021 se pehle loksabhaa chunaavon ke saath hi kara liye jaaen
 But Rajinikanth has refused to contest the elections of the long-pending local bodies, which would have been a good exercise to weigh his own strength and develop an organizational structure
 ve agle loksabhaa chunaavon ko lekar bhi khamosh hai
 Analysts are also a bit skeptical
 murti kehete hai, ''rajnikant kam bolne vaale shaks hai, utane hi aspasht jitne ki unke sambhavit pratidwandvi camel hasan ke lambey or ghumaavdaar vaakya duruh hote hai
 Both are yet to face the heat of flat and sharp questions from the media and the assembly

 raamu manivann kaa kahana he, ''unki saadhaaran chhavi or prishthbhumi hi unhen itani dur le ai he lekin yah raajnneeti main bhi kaam kar jaaegi, yah maan lenaa sandehaaspad he
 "so whether public support will turn into a big support for any third option made by putting Rajinikanth's face in front is not clear or not
 ek cheez spasht najar aa rahi he, or vah he paanch dashak ke dravid shashan or uske saath aae bhrashtachar va bhai-bhatijawad se mohabhang
 Chances of change in this gloomy environment have raised expectations
 apni vishisht parde vaali style ke anuroop ghoshnaa ke ek din baad rajnikant ne soshal media par aate hue agle din apane aadhikarik twitor pej par ek video massej post kiya
 He announced the launch of a special web portal and mobile application to connect with his fans and those interested in changing the politics of the state
 unhone video main kaha, ''aao ham sab milakar tamilnadu main ek acha badlaav lekar aaen
 Hail to Tamil Nadu and Tamil people

 The farmers of Jhansi district, who were still victims of the natural calamity (hail), had not completed in two weeks, that for some farmers, the second disaster caused havoc

 Under the leadership of the officers and the police, the tractor on the ready crop of the farmers was driven and completely mixed into the ground

 Here farmers had sown wheat and mustard crops

 Whereas after harvesting this crop, the farmers could be given the opportunity to vacate the land, or the crop could also be taken under government occupation

 In this case, the administrative staff showed proactively, ignoring the rules, and on the same day in the presence of sub-collector Poonam Nigam and Station Officer-in-charge Kamta Prasad, ruined the crop standing in the field by tractor
 jin kisaanon kii fasalein barbaad kii gai unamem se zyadatar dalit hai or unke paas gujaarey kaa saadhan bhi nahin he
 After the matter came to light, when reporters were asked by the Principal Secretary Suresh Chandra, who visited the district, he said that this method of freeing the land was wrong and asked for an investigation and action in the case

 It’s tragic and irresponsible that the truths of such a condemnable act are being distorted by the media to suit their political agendas
 These men have been robbed of not just their lives but also the respect that they deserve as protectors of a nation
 Let’s pray for the souls of our brave men and for the strength of their families

 unhone baar-baar bengal kaa daura kiya, reliyaan kin, jhonpadipoon main dalit votaron ke saath khaanaa khaaya, trinmul congress (tiemasi) ke kai netaaon ko apni party main khinchaa or mukhyamantri mamata banerjee par 'muslim tushtikaran' kaa aarope lagaate hue unke khilaaf muhim chalaate rahe
 They are getting the benefit now: a section of Bengal voters who feel intimidated by the Trinamool's seven-year rule feels that they have found a good alternative
 sthiti kii gambhirtha kaa ehsaas kar mamata ne aakraamak rukh apanaate hue ladaai ko bhagava kheme main le jane kaa faisla kiya
 In response to the BJP, he coined the new slogan, 'agar Delhi Shamla, Pore Bhabi Bangla' (think Delhi first, then think of Bengal)
 is par bhaajapa thodi bachaav kii mudra main aati dikhi
 Defeat in by-elections across the country showed that bjp's support in the public has decreased due to demonetisation and GST, especially among the middle class
 badhati naaraazgi kaa phayda uthaate hue mamata ne 'chalo dilli' ke aahvaan ke saath modi-shah kii jodi ko takkar dene kaa faisla kiya
 He intensified the attack as early as 2019
 19 janvari ko kolkata main united india raily main unke saath 22 rajnatik partiyon ke netaa manch par maujuud the
 Shah has set a target of winning 23 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state for the BJP
 is bich mamata ne bhi party netaaon ko sakht hidaayat di he ki ve rajya kii 42 main se ek bhi seat ganvaana nahin chaahatin taaki unhen pradhanmantri pad ke liye daavedaari pesh karne main madad mil sake
 She is repeatedly emphasizing on how Bengal will pave the way to save the country from the 'fascist' BJP
 ve apane pradesh main logon ke dimag main yah baat baitaane kaa prayaas kar rahi hai ki is baar desh kaa pradhanmantri koi bengali hona chahie
 On the other hand, it has become important for the state's main opposition BJP to curb Mamata's ambition
 rabindra bharti vishvavidhyalay main raajnneeti shaastra ke professor vishwanath chakravarti kehete hai, ''bhaajapa 10-12 siten bhi jitati he to yah baat sthapit ho jaaegi ki mamata ab ajey nahin
 Assembly elections will also be held in two years
 '' yahaan daanv itane oonche hai ki vichaardhaara kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin rah gaya he
 Both parties want to field candidates who can win the election
 sangh kaaryakarta jishnu basu kehete hai, ''aresas ne bengal main party (bhaajapa) ko khuli chhot de rakhi he
 They are free to choose the candidate of their choice, just to ensure that they win the election
 '' aisa spasht nirdesh party padaadhikariyon main neeche se upar tak pahunch gaya he
 No internal differences are being allowed
 dalbadaluon ko bhi tikat se nawaja ja rahaa he
 The five general secretaries, who had been associated with the party since then, could not get tickets, as they were replaced by defectors such as Arjun Singh, Soumitra Khan and Anupam Hazra (from Trinamool), Khagen Murmu of the CPI-M
 kabhi mamata kii kareebi raheen purv ipies bharti ghosh ko bhaajapa kaa tikat mil gaya he
 Ghosh is contesting from Ghatal in West Midnapore, where he has had considerable influence while being an SP, as he helped liberate the area from Maoists
 congress or vammorcha haashie par chale gaye hai
 Many of their leaders have shifted to other parties
 shuru main trinmul virdohi voton kaa bikharaav rokane ke liye donon partiyon ne 2019 kaa chunaav saath ladgaye kii sochi thi (2016 main gathbandhan ke kaaran bhaajapa kaa vot 10 pratishat par aa gaya tha jo 2014 main 17 pratishat tha)
 But the spoils in both have made the election of Bengal four-angled
 vaise siyaasi jaankaron ke mutabik, satta-virdohi bhavanaaen itani bhari hui hai ki vot bhaajapa ko mil sakate hai or trinmul ko haraane ke liye uske paas yah umdaa mauka ho saktaa he
 This is the reason why Mamata is putting her full strength to the point that she gets 28 percent of the Muslim vote
 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki pulavama or balakot par sawaal uthaanaa mamata kii sochi-samajhi ranneeti kaa hi hissaa he
 Chakraborty says, "mamta is not a fool, she has been raising questions only keeping her vote bank in mind
" '' congress ke puraane netaa abdul mannaan kehete hai, ''bhaajapa or trinmul congress apane-apane vot bainkon kaa paksh lekar pradesh ke dharmanirpeksh taane-bane ko nasht karne par tuli hai
 Communal polarization is clearly visible on at least 10 seats
 ye siten hai uttari or dakshini deenajpur, uttari or dakshini malda, bashirhaat, bongau, barasaat, krishnanagar, ranaghat or dakshin 24 pargana jahaan pichley paanch saal main bhaajapa kaa janaadhar kaaphi badha he
 It is said that BJP is also eyeing 10 other constituencies where the minority population is 15 percent
 samajashastri or presidency college ke purv professor prashanth re kehete hai, ''un hindu bahul ilaakon main jahaan satta-virdohi bhavanaaen prabal hai, bhaajapa ko phayda mil saktaa he, haalanki hinduon ko dharmik aadhaar par vot karne ke liye nahin janaa jaataa
 Perhaps realizing this, Mamata is trying her best to change the discourse of elections
 ve apana chunaav prachaar mukhya rup se notebandi, enarasi, arabiai or sibiai jaisi sansthaaon ke patan or rafel saude par kendrit rakh rahi hai
 She is already seeing her big role on the situation arising after the election
 ve matadaataaon ke bich yah ummid jinda rakhane kii koshish kar rahi hai ki is baar dilli main koi bengali pradhanmantri banane kii puri sambhaavna he
 Mamta Banerjee - the strength of any opposition coalition, the Chief Minister of Trinamool and Chief Minister Mamata is showing her the dream of becoming the Bengali Prime Minister for the first time to arouse enthusiasm among voters

 On the other hand, in this case, Max Hospital has dismissed both doctors, but till now the family members of the child have been sitting on dharna outside the hospital for many days even at night, pleading for justice

 The 2017 election was very important for Ansari
 kyonki is chunaav main 'bahubali' ko maat dene ke liye piem modi ne katappa ko chunavi maidan main utaara tha
 Prime Minister Modi himself had called him as 'bahubali' in the public meeting of Mau and he has fielded his 'katappa' to end this 'bahubali'
 piem modi ne 'katappa' isliye kaha tha kyonki is seat par bhaajapa ne rajbharon kii party bhartiya samaaj party ke ummidavaar mahendra rajbhar ko gathbandhan ke tahat utaara tha
 But this 'bahubali' Mukhtar of BSP defeated Katappa by 7464 votes
 bahubali netaa mukhtaar ansaari kaa janm upi ke gajipur jile main hua tha
 His grandfather, Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, was earlier the president of the All India Congress
 is tarah se dekha jaae to mukhtaar ansaari ko raajnneeti viraasat main mili
 At one time, BSP chief Mayawati had called Ansari as the messiah of the poor and even Robinhood

 My house is not much distance from IIT Delhi
 itnaa jaanata tha ki iaiti ke chaatr kaaphi bade 'karname' karte rahete hai, lekin kabhi dekhne kaa mauka nahin mila tha
 When my colleague Rajneesh came to know that some workshop was going to be held inside the IIT campus, i reached there to do a story
 mere story kii avadhi zyada nahin thi, kyonki tivi par ek story ke andar samay kaa dhyaan bhi rakhana padataa he
 i felt that students should be told about the great feats they have done
 kuch chaatro ne yah shikaayat kii ki media vaale to aate hai, lekin kuch dikhaate nahin hai
 The IIT campus was very crowded
 alag-alag skulon se chaatr yahaan workshop dekhne aae the
 i first arrived at the seminar hall of IIIT, where i met Rishabh Agarwal, a student here
 rishabh ne mujhe vah innovations dikhaaya, jise dekhakar main hairaan rah gaya
 Inside this seminar hall, i could see Robo
 do robo badminton khel rahe the, to ek anya robo ek jagah se duusare jagah saamaan lekar ja rahaa tha
 Some Robo were also playing video games in the computer
 rishabh kaa kahana tha ki 16 chaatro kii unki team ne yah robo banaaya he or pune main hui pratiyogita main jahaan 85 tiimon ne hissaa liya the, vahaan "best innovative dizine" kaa puraskaar bhi mil chukaa he
 Now we left that seminar hall and went towards the other building
 ek chaatr kii madad se ham maathur seminar haul pahunche
 i saw some children walking with a stick
 hamen laga koi saadhaaran si chadi he, lekin poochne par pataa chalaa ki is chadi kaa kamaal kuch or he
 This stick is made for those who cannot see and have difficulty in finding the way
 is chadi ko 'smart ken' kehete hai, jiske andar ultrasound sensor laga hua he
 Through this, information about any object up to three meters can be obtained by vibration
 ye chadi ab bazaar main uplabdh he or koi bhi kharid saktaa he
 Some farmers were seen at another place in the campus
 aisa laga maano rahul gandhi kii prastaavit kisaan raily kii jagah ho
 
 
 But it was not so
 darasal ye kisaan yahaan wo saamaan dekhne aae the, jo yahaan ke chaatro ne un ke liye banaaya he
 Here is an excavator machine prepared by IIT students, which can work like a tractor
 chote kisaan jinke paas puunji kii kami he, ve iskaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 Students named Anil Kumar and Lal Singh designed this machine and its price is only around 20,000 rupees, which is very low compared to the price of the tractor
 ab hamaari nazar ek aisi mashin ke upar padi, jo kachra uthaati he
 The machine was quite small, but the feat was quite large
 aap is mashin ke jariye kachra uthaakar ek jagah se duusare jagah le ja sakate hai
 This machine is made by Ayush and Pradeep together with Aniket
 iskaa keemat lagbhag 3500 ke kareeb he
 On the go, we met Indra Kumar Sahu, a resident of Chhattisgarh and studying design engineering at IIT
 indra or unke saathi jayanto kumaar, krishna kumaar gupta or anup kumaar ne milakar ek multi utility chair banaaya he
 There is also a table light in this chair
 padhai karte vaqt agar thakaan mahasoos ho, to is chair ko bistar banaakar aap aaraam bhi farma sakate hai
 The comments ab ham waapas laut rahe the, tabhi peeche se awaz ai, suniye
 
 
 Please tell a little about us
 yah awaz thi arun kii
 Arun and his partner have created a machine, through which you can save your clothes from getting wet from the rain
 yahaan dekhne ke liye bahut kuch tha, lekin hamaara paas samay kaa abhaav tha
 Yes, after coming here, we found that the students have made something for the convenience of everyone, which can be used in your homes very quickly
 iaiti parisar main kaaphi bheed thi
 Students from different schools came to see the workshop here
 main pehle iaaiti ke seminar haul main pahunchaa, jahaan meri mulaakaat rishabh agarwal se hui, jo yahaan ke chaatr hai
 Rishabh showed me the innovation, which i was surprised to see
 is seminar haul ke andar mujhe robo hi robo dikhaai de rahe the
 Two robo were playing badminton, while another robo was carrying goods from one place to another
 kuch robo to computer main video game bhi khel rahe the
 Rishabh said that his team of 16 students made this robo and where 85 teams took part in the competition in Pune, "best Innovative Design" award has also been received
 ab ham us seminar haul se nikalakar duusari building ke taraf gaye
 With the help of a student, we reached Mathur Seminar Hall
 vahaan dekha ki kuch bachche ek chadi lekar chal rahe hai
 We thought there is a simple stick, but on asking, it turned out that this stick has something else
 yah chadi un logon ke liye banaaya gaya he, jinhen dikhaai nahin detaa or rasta khojane main dikat hoti he
 This stick is called 'smart Can', which has an ultrasound sensor inside it
 iske jariye teen meter tak kisi bhi vastu ke bare main wibrasion ke dwaara jaankaree mil sakati he
 This stick is now available in the market and anyone can buy
 parisar main ek anya jagah par kuch kisaan nazar aae
 It seemed as if Rahul Gandhi's proposed Kisan Rally was in place
 
 
 lekin aisa nahin tha
 Actually these farmers came here to see the stuff that the students here have made for them
 yahaan iaiti chaatro dwaara taiyaar khudaai karne vaali ek mashin he, jo tractor kii tarah kaam kar sakati he
 Small farmers who lack capital can use it
 anil kumaar or laal singh naamak chaatro ne is mashin ko taiyaar kiya or isaki keemat sirf 20,000 hazaar rupee ke kareeb he, jo tractor ke daam ke mukaable behad kam he
 Now we have an eye on a machine that picks up garbage
 mashin kaaphi choti thi, lekin karnama kaaphi bada
 You can pick up the garbage and move it from one place to another through this machine
 is mashin ko aniket ke saath aayush or pradeep ne milakar banaaya he
 Its price is around 3500
 chalate-chalate hamaari mulaaqaat indra kumaar sahu se hui, jo chhattisgarh ke rahane vaale hai or iaiti main dizine ejineering kii padhai kar rahe hai
 Indra and his partners Jayanto Kumar, Krishna Kumar Gupta and Anoop Kumar have formed a multi utility chair
 is chair main teble lite bhi lagi hui he
 If you feel tired while studying, you can also rest by making this chair a bed
 tippaniyan Now we were returning, then the voice came from behind, listen
 
 
 hamaare bare main bhi thodaa bataa dijie
 This was the voice of Arun
 arun or unke saathi ne ek aisi mashin banaai he, jiske jariye aap barish se apane kapade ko bhigane se bachaa sakate hai
 There was a lot to see here, but we lacked time
 haa, yahaan aakar hamane paaya ki chaatro ne har kisi kii suvidha ke liye kuch na kuch banaaya he, jo bahut jaldi aap logon ke gharon main istemaal ho saktaa he
 Now we left that seminar hall and went towards the other building

 Three installments and six murders
 haal ke vakt main dilli kii shaayad ye sabase khaufnak vaardaat he
 After killing five of these six murders, the murderer burys them at two different places
 donon jagahon ke bich kaa faaslaa kareeb 90 kilometre rakhata he
 Look at the murderer's hatred that he first takes his victim out of Tihar Jail to do the last murder
 iske baad wo chatha or aakhri katl karata he
 Chaudhary Munawwar Hassan, the head of the cart in the ground after killing the mothers and daughters, was lodged inside the Tihar jail and the enemy was eyeing his house outside the jail
 saazish or nafrat donon hi behad gahari thi
 Due to this, on April 21, 2017, the enemy made the first attack about 90 km from Tihar Jail in Daurala
 ek hi waar main ek saath teen katl kiye gaye
 The mother and her two young daughters were brutally murdered
 katl ke baad teenon laashen daurala ilaake main hi gaad di gayi
 No one even heard the news of this
 beton ko katl kar ghar main hi dafn kiyamerut main maa or do betiyon kii maut badadilli ke buradeemen ab bhi parivaar main teen or log zindaa bache the
 Two sons and head of household
 magar ghar kaa mukhiya tihaad jail main band tha
 Who could not be killed by entering into jail
 lihaaza pehle donon beton ko thikaane lagane kii sajeesh rachi gai
 The two sons happily leave their homes with the murderer and only after walking half a kilometer, they realize that they are trapped
 donon ko ek khaali makaan main kareeb 24 ghante tak bandhak bana kar rakhaa jataa he
 After this, they also do the same thing that happened to their mother and sisters
 22 april, 2017 ko donon beton kaa katl kar unheen ke ghar main gaad diya jaataa he
 There were five murders by now
 ab bas aakhri katl hona baaki tha
 The head of the family who came out of jail on parole is on 17 May 2017
 buraadi ke jis parivaar ke paanch log maut kii neend sula die gaye, us parivaar kaa mukhiya choudhary munwwar hasan jail main band tha
 He did not know anything about the enemy outside
 par jaise hi use pataa chalaa ki uski bivi, do bete or do betiyaan yani puraa parivaar maheene bhar se gaayab hai, to use kuch shaq hua
 And on this basis, the court released him on parole so that he could find his family
 is kaam main uske partner banty ne uski madad kii
 The murder of the head of the family by entering the house was on 20 May 2017
 munwwar apane parivaar ko talash rahaa tha
 a complaint was lodged with the police
 thane se lautakar vah buraadi main maujuud apane ghar kii pehali manzil par tha
 It had been only three days since he came out of jail
 tabhi achaanak uske ghar main goli chalane kii awaz sunai di
 In fact, in the morning, the same enemy entered the house of the same serial killer Munawar and shot Munavar
 is tarah teen kishton main ek parivaar ke chah logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya jaataa he
 but why? After all, what hostility did that person have from this family? Friend turned out to be an enemy! After the arrest of this killer, when the layers of this most sensational murder mystery of recent times began to open, everyone was shocked
 do doston ke bich dushmani kii ye kahani aisa khooni rang dikhaaegi sochna bhi mushkil he
 Munavvar had a friend, who had a dagger in his back
 aaie ab aapako silsilewar puri vaardaat bataate hai
 Apart from politics, Munawar used to work in property
 The last victim of these six murders in one by one and the person who came out on parole from Tihar was none other than Chaudhary Munawwar Hassan, a BSP leader of Delhi, who was a party from Badli area of delhi
 He had contested the 2015 assembly elections on the ticket of hasan raajnneeti ke alaava property dling kaa kaam karata tha or is kaam main banty naamak ek shaks uskaa partner tha
 Since Hassan's family was missing, as much as Hassan was in jail, his friend Bunty outside the jail was equally upset
 isi banty ne vakil kii madad se hasan ko perol par jail se baahar nikalvaaya tha
 Bunty turned out to be the killer of the entire family
 It was during the 48 hours of Hassan's murder that Delhi Police arrested Hassan's friend Bunty
 ji haa, police kii maane to ye banty hi tha, jisane pehle hasan ke parivaar ko ek-ek kar maut ke ghat utaara auki phir aakhir main khud hasan ko perol par jail se aaazaad kara kar use bhi maar daalaa
 To carry out this task, Bunty hatched a creepy conspiracy
 har katl ke liye 50 hajaar kii supaari!teen lakh rupee or chah logon ke katl kii supaari
 That is, 50 thousand rupees for each murder
 munwwar ke bete or betiyon kii umr 16 se 20 saal thi
 Now the question is that if Bunty had enmity with Munawar then why did he kill his wife and children? So, according to the police, the enmity was such that Bunty was not ready to spare anyone
 isiilie usne kishton main puure parivaar kaa safaya kar diya
 The property dispute was the cause of enmity, killing and killing of six people of the same family
 aakhir kaatil kii makatool yaa uske parivaar se aisi kya dushmani thi? shuruuaati jaanch nateezon par yakeen karen to is katl ke peeche 44property kaa jhagadatha
 The 44 properties that were disputed and on which Munawar Hasan and his partner Bunty had an equal share
 yani 22-22 property donon ke hisse aani thim
 But Munawar Hassan was probably overturned by the promise
 yaheen se shuru hoti he do doston kii dushmani
 a series of murders happened in this way
 Under this enmity, three murders were committed in the first installment
 21 april kii subah banty, munwwar hasan kii bivi ishrat or do betiyon ko apane saath meerut le jaataa he
 Where Ishrat's sister lives
 magar agle roj meerut ke najadik hi wo ishrat or uski do betiyon 18 saal kii aarazu or 17 saal kii arshi kaa qatl kar detaa he
 After the murder, the three dead bodies are buried in Daurala area of meerut
 iske baad meerut se laut kar banty dilli aata he or munwwar hasan ke donon beton 20 saal ke aaqib 19 saal ke saaqib ko apane paas bulaata he
 Then on April 22, the dead body of Burari is also slaughtered and the corpse is buried there
 jail se baahar laakar maari goliis vaardaat ke dauraan khud munwwar hasan rape ke ek iljaam main tihaad jail main band tha
 So she did not get the news of the family's disappearance
 baad main use ye khabar kisi or ne nahin balki khud banty ne hi di
 After this, Bunty arranged for him to come out of jail
 kroonki wo chahta tha ki munwwar jail se baahar aae
 On May 17, Bunty himself went with him to Burari police station the next day after getting Munwar out of jail and got the family missing
 lekin phir do din baad hi 20 may ko kisi ne munwwar ke ghar main ghus kar use goli maar di
 Bunty, who was a vicious accused in the case of Bantis, was on the police radar, probably not caught so soon
 lekin munwwar ke rishtedaaron ko banty kii harkaton par shaq tha
 Then just before the murder Munavvar's neighbors saw him coming to his house
 yahaan tak ki 20 may kii subah munwwar ke qatl ke baad police ko pehla phone karne vaala bhi khud banty hi tha
 In such a situation, Bunty was now on the radar of the police
 isi shaq kii binah par jab police ne banty ko pakadaa to usne sara sach ugal diya
 According to the police, Bunty had given a betel nut of three lakh rupees to the slaughterers for the annihilation of Munawar's family
 ab police ko shaq he ki munwwar ko rape ke iljaam main fansaane vaala bhi shaashad banty hi tha
 On the basis of Bunty's spot, a police team was dispatched to Meerut on the basis of the statement of the body recovered
 jahaan se uski nishandehi par police ne munwwar kii patni or donon betiyon kii laashen baraamad kar lee hai
 Along with this, the police have also recovered the bodies of both the sons of Munawar from his house

 The film will be released on December 28 this year
 kya he vivadakhabar he ki kedarnath ke produsar kriarj antertenment or tii-siries ,abhishek kapur se naaraaz hai
 He continues to suffer financial losses, as Abhishek is unable to handle the production
 ekta kapur ne film main 8 karod rupye kaa nivesh kiya he, jabaki tii siries or kriarj ne 15-15 karod nivesh kiye
 Abhishek was supposed to complete 'kedarnath' 16 months ago, but it was not done yet
 abhishek kapur kaa farhaan akhtar, anoushka sharma, rekha ke saath bhi vivaad ho chukaa he
 After the rift, director Abhishek Kapoor broke off from the production house (kriarj Entertainment and t-series)

 GITS ne apane kaam ko sahi tareeke se nahin kiya he
 Production of the film was greatly delayed
 GITS kii vajah se film ko shuru se hi nuksaan jhelana padaa he
 It has further been written that, despite all these negligence, kriarj Entertainment gave unconditional support to GITS
 saath hi film main apana baari nivesh jari rakhaa
 But later it turned out that the given amount is not being used properly
 hamane GITS ke saath baat kar kai baar vivaad ko thik karne kii koshish kii lekin ham asafal rahe
 kriarj, t-series and Balaji are the official owners of this film
 isliye ko-producers or GITS ke paas koi adhikaar nahin ki wo kriarj ko film se nikaale
 We will go to Bombay High Court next week for our rights
 hamen ummid he ki mananeey court hamaare saath nyaay karegaa
 Saif's daughter Sara is a hit on social media, see photosamrita Singh Disappointed, there are also reports that Sara's mother Amrita Singh is also very angry with this attitude of the director

 rashtriya lok samta party (ralospa) ne samachar channelon par hone vaali sampradayik bahason ke bangkaat kaa faisla liya he
 The party's national president and MP Upendra Kushwaha said, 'news channels are running the agenda of RAS and BJP and this is a serious threat to the country
 party ke rashtrica mahasachiv va pravaktaa fazal imam mallik ne enditivi ko bataaya ki kushvaha ne congress adhyaksh sahit samaan vichaardhaara vaale dalon ko patr likh kar kaha he ki ve bhi apane pravaktaaon ko is tarah kii bahes main hissaa lene nahin bhejein
 Mallik said that Upendra Kushwaha, apart from Rahul Gandhi, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, Hum chief Jitan Ram Manjhi, VIP party chief Mukesh Sahni, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, BSP chief Mayawati, Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N
 Chandrababu Naidu, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Sharad Yadav of Loktantrik Janata Dal, Farooq Abdullah of National Conference, HD of JDS Egudha is written
 patr main upendra kushvaha ne likhaa he ki 'pichley kuch saalon or khaas kar kuch maheenon se samachar channelon kii bhoomika lagaataar sawaalon main he
 The kind of debate that is taking place in the news channels and the attitude of the anchors with the opposition parties does not only question the credibility of the channels, the role of the channels also looks suspicious
 aisa lagata he ki samachar channel aresas or bhaajapa ke agenda ko apane jariye aage badhaane main lage hai
 This is a serious question before the country
 channel mul muddon se bhatka kar mandir-masjid, deshbhakt-deshadroh or hindu-musalmaan jaise muddon ko oochaal kar unmaad failaane main lage hai
 Constant efforts are being made to involve the opposition parties in this game
 hamen isse bachanaa chahie
 Manjhi said - If you do not want seats less than Kushwaha, then if you do not consider the other option, the National Lok Samata Party is in favor of social justice
 vipakshi dalon ke liye bhi yah behad samvedansheel vishay he
 Our aim is to crush the society on political platforms
 pichde, atipichade, dalit-mahadalit, akliyat, adivasee or vanchiton kii aawaaj ko shiddat se uthaanaa he
 We have been continuously fighting for employment, youth, farmers and social issues
 lekin channel or bhaajapa va aresas in muddon kii bajaay chhadam rashtrawaad or hindu-musalmaan kii bahason main uljhane kii lagaataar koshish kar rahi he
 We need to be careful with them
 isliye hamaara aapse vinamr nivedan he ki in muddon par hone vaale tivi bahason kaa ham boykat karen
 We should avoid sending our spokespersons to discuss these issues 
 rashtriya lok samta party ne faisla kiya he ki ve in muddon par hone vaale bahason se dur rahegi
 The party will definitely participate in debates on social and political issues
 aashaa karata hum ki aap is masale par gambhirtha se vichaar karenge or tivi channelon par hone vaale nafrat bhare vishyon par hone vaali bahason se apane ko dur rakhenge
 It is necessary to do this for the national interest

 a post shared by Jacqueline Fernandez (@jacquelinef143) on Nov 9, 2017 at 11:59pm PST The bhubaneswar-delhi capital express, stalled by the Maoists in Midnapore, West Bengal, has been rescued
 kendriya grahamantri pi chidambaram ne bataaya ki train ke sabhi yatri surakshit hai
 All 1200 passengers, armed with the Maoist-backed group, intercepted the bhubaneswar-delhi Rajdhani train on Tuesday and held the iconic train in a hijacked position in the jungle area of west Midnapore district for several hours but all 1200 passengers were safe
 pipuls kamity against police atrocities (pisipie) ke ugravadiyon dwaara kai ghante tak bandhak banaae rakhane ke baad siarpief or rajya police ne vahaan pahunchakar railgadee ko surakshit kiya
 The train was stopped at around two and a half in the afternoon while it could be rescued five hours later
 maovadiyon kii maang hui khaarijnai dilli main sthiti kii nigaraanee kar rahe grih mantri pi chidambaram ne kaha, ‘‘railgadee surakshit he or yatri bhi surakshit hai
 He said that there were no signs of any adverse situation at the scene
 railgadee subah nau baje bhubaneshwar se chali thi
 The pcpa's demands also included the release of its jailed leader Chhatradhar Mahato, which was rejected outright by West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya
 maangon ko railgadee ke dibbon par bhi likh diya gaya
 The Maoists fled as soon as the security personnel arrived
 The militants fled as soon as the security personnel reached the spot
 unhone kaha ki ghatnasthal se kuch dur ek jagah par thodi golibari bhi hui jisamen ek asainik chaalak ghayal ho gaya
 The militants, numbering about 400, stopped the train by putting tree branches on the railway tracks at Banstala, 10 km from Jhargram station, and ordered the two drivers to get off the train
 praarambhik reporton ke anusaar donon chaalkon kaa apharan kar liya gaya tha
 Banerjee said that the drivers are safe
 pratyakshdarshiyon ne kaha ki ugravadiyon ne yatriyon ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaaya or patariyon ke najadik kai laal jhande the
 Many of the train's mirrors, armed with broken axes, swords, arrows and bows, attacked the air-conditioned train with stones, breaking the glass of several coaches and forcibly opening the doors, leaving passengers in awe
 sankat khatm hone ke thodi der pehle hi bhattacharya ne maovadiyon kii mahato or unke giraftaar netaaon kii rihaai tathaa suraksha balon ko hataane kii maang ko khaarij kar diya tha
 Demands were also written on train coaches

 koi bhi hostel apane aap main ek puri duniya hoti he jahaan har dharm, samskruti or kshetra se log aate hai
 People with every habit are present here, whether you like them or dislike it is up to you
 or baat agar bvoij hostel kii karen to koi bhi bahari vyakti agar yahaan ek din bhi ruke to vah achambhit ho jayega ki vah kis duniya main aa gaya he
 The atmosphere from the hostel room to the mess is such that it cannot be imagined outside the hostel
 yahaan har tip ke praani basate hai
 If someone keeps sleeping, then someone stays awake all night
 koi shant he to kisi kii aawaaj hostel main goonjati rahati he
 Here we are going to tell you about some similar characters of hostels
 
 
 1
 Always living from the lost: Don't know on which planet people of this type keep wandering
 inhen jab bhi dekho to aisa lagata he ki inkaa kuch kho gaya he or yah use khojane kii koshish kar rahe hon
 2
 dharmik:ye aise log hai jo pariksha dene se pehle, rigelt aane se pehle, kahin jane se pehle, paper prengent karne se pehle har baat par bhagwaan ko yaad karnaa nahin bhoolatey hai
 The students living in the rooms around them demand flowers, incense sticks from them for worshiping during the festival
 koi bhi musiibat ho, ye use uuparavaale par chhod dete hai
 3
 bhaiya / dada:ye aise log hote hai jo sabhi kii madad ke liye taiyaar rahete hai
 While having fun, no one asks them, but in the time of trouble, everyone remembers them
 4
 Feku number one: Whatever chance you have, do not stop lying
 inaki pole khulne se pehle hi ye ek nai kahani gadhakar taiyaar ho jate hai
 They also have the contract to spread false things in hostels
 5
 Trying to play the game: Whether you go to their room or eat in the mess, they are completely focused on the game and are always in the process of breaking their record and crossing the level
 6
 Those who are busy on the phone: Their roommate is always disturbed by them, they stay on the phone till late night
 rummet kii pareshaani jab inhen samaj main aa jaati he to ye yaa to coridor main paae jate hai yaa hostel kii sidhiyon par
 7
 padhaaku number van:inke liepariksha kaa samayameshaa najadik rahata he, ye na to kisi party main milte hai or na hi kahin ghumne jate hai
 It seems like a waste of time in Fizul to participate in any such activity
 lekin kya karen ye tamaam koshishon ke baavjood bhikolegemen top nahin kar pate hai
 8
 bas mauka hona chahie, party arange ye khud kar lenge:hostel ke aise ladakon ko bas pataa hone kii deree he ki phalnaa student kaa berthde is taarikh ko he
 They manage themselves from arranging money to decorating rooms
 yahi nahin, ye kisi se jabardasti party lene main bhi maahir hote hai
 9
 netaa tip:aap hostel main ghuste hi pahchaan jaaenge ki yahaan netaa koun he, inke pahanaave se lekar inkaa cameraa tak is baat kii gavaahi detaa he ki yekolege ke netaahain
 If the leader is ideologically weak and has money, then there is always a crowd of disciples around him
 10
 My voice is the identity: they live in any corner of the hostel, but their voice keeps coming everywhere
 ye kabhi bhi shanti se nahin baat karte hai
 Whether arguing or laughing, it is a bad disease to shout
 himmatvar sarkarein agar bade faisle leti hai to unhen faislon ke nattejey bataane se hichakana nahin chahie
 If demonetisation spoils the budget of everyone from employment to business, then the government will definitely get a huge tax or a big dividend from the Reserve Bank! But the budget also passed, however, neither the government spoke nor the Reserve Bank bothered to tell the figures about the benefits and losses of demonetisation
 notebandi ko bisaarne kii tamaam koshishon ke baavjood bajet or aarthik samiksha notebandi se jude kuch tathy saamne laati he
 If they are tied in one thread, then we will realize that there is no senseless desperation on demonetisation
 tir!kahawat he jisaki naap-jokh nahin ho sakati, use sanbhaalanaa bhi asambhav he
 The Finance Minister has said that no concrete assessment of cash black money is available
 to 500 or 1000 ke note band karne or 86 fisadi nakadi ko ekamusth avaidh qaraar dene kaa itnaa bada nirnay kis akalan par aadhaarit tha?aarthik samiksha kii maane to karency noton kaa soyal rate (noton ke gande hone or katane-fatne kii dar) is faisle kaa aadhaar tha
 Gives information about usage of soil rate notes
 rigerv bank ke aankadon ke mutabik, 500 ru
 Soil rate is 33 per cent per annum in notes with a value below Rs, ie 33 per cent of dirty mutilated notes are changed every year
 500 ru
 The note has a soil rate of Rs 22 and Rs 1000
 ke note main 11 fisadi he
 The review has applied the soil rate in other countries of the world to the circulation of big notes in India, concluding that about Rs 3 lakh crore before demonetisation
 ke bade note aise the jinka bharpoor istemaal len-dein main nahin hota tha
 Can this amount be considered as black cash which is equal to two per cent of GDP? The review on this question is silent, however it gives two dimensions of cash
 safed dhanhraseed katkar or tex kii ghoshnaa ke baad karmchaariyon ko diya gaya nakad vetan yaa gharon main aakasmikta ke liye rakhaa gaya dhan
 Black money: Small companies or traders keep money in cash and donate to elections
 nishaanaa!bajet ke aankade notebandi ke nishane par baithne kaa pramaan nahin dete
 There is no estimation of a lump sum amount in the tax data, however, the data definitely suggests that the rate of increase in income tax collection will be faster
 notebandi ke baad advance tex bhugtan lagbhag 35 fisadi badha he
 Income tax collections are expected to grow by about 25 per cent next year
 yadi akalan sahi utre to do saal main kareeb 1
 5 lakh crore Rs
 kaa atirikt iskar mil saktaa he
 The Reserve Bank has not told how much money has remained out of the banking system in the big notes, so the assessment of getting a big dividend from the Reserve Bank is not available
 nuksaan''notebandi se nahin koi mandi" kaa dam bharne ke baavjood sarkaar ne maan liya he ki growth kii gaadi patari se utar gai he
 The Economic Review states that due to demonetisation, this year about one per cent of the economic growth rate (7 last year
 6) kii giravat hogi
 The growth rate will be below 7 percent next year
 notebandi se rojgaar gata he, kheti main aay ko chot lagi he or nakad par aadhaarit asangathit kshetra main bada nuksaan hua, lekin iske aankade sarkaar ke paas uplabdh nahin hai
 The government believes that deposits will come out of the banks faster once the cash flow becomes normal, demonetisation has shocked the credibility of the government-reserve Bank and there is confusion among the people about the future
 hisaab-kitabanotbandi maudrik faisla tha isliye phaayde-nuksaan ko aankadon main naapnaa hoga
 On scrutinizing the budget and review, we get only two concrete figures
 phaaydadya notebandi ke baad is saal ke chaar maheenon main or agle saal ke dauraan iskar sangrah main lagbhag 1
 5 lakh crore Rs
 kii badhat ho sakati he
 Demonetisation in 2016-17 will lead to a one percent reduction in GDP, which is 1
 5 lakh karod ru
 Is around rigerv bank ke liye noton kii chapai kii laagat or bazaar main nakadi kaa pravaah santulit karne ke liye jari bondon par byaaj ko bhi isamen jodpha hoga
 Even if indirect losses are not counted, the estimate of increase in income tax revenue is exactly equal to the loss of GDP
 baaki aap khud samajhadaar hai
 We have tried to find a solution to ongoing MCD strike
 Will announce at 3 pm
 Hope it satisfies everyone and the strike ends dilli main shiksha kaa str sudhaarney ke liye kejariwal sarkaar ek bada kadam uthaane ja rahi he
 The government plans to soon change the way examinations are being conducted in schools
 iske liye dilli ke up mukhyamantri or shiksha mantri manish sisodiya ne kai shikshavidon se raay maangi he
 The age of admission in the place will be 3 years, new instructions have been prepared
 The government has written a letter and asked for this opinion
 ye jaankaree dete hue sisodiya ne kaha, 'ab ham acesment or ejamination system main aavashyak badlaav karne par vichaar kar rahe hai
 This is important because it affects the teaching-learning process
 'dilli: schuli chaatro kii sankhya badi, 44 lakh tak pahunchaa aankadagauratlab he ki is letters ke saath sisodiya ne kaksha 4-8 tak ke ejamination paper bhi atech kiye hai jisase un par bhi shikshavid feedback de saken

 abhinayta shahid kapur kehete hai ki yadi unhen apni pasand kii ladki mil jaati he, to vah shaadi kar ghar basaa lenge
 Shahid is currently in his new film 'R
 
 Waiting for Rajkumar's performance
 32 varshiya shahid peshewar jindagi ke saath ab apni nijee jindagi ko bhi raste par laana chaahate hai
 Shahid said, "I have been single and happy for many years
 yadi mujhe koi ladki pasand aati he, to shaayad main uske saath ghar basaa luungaa
 Otherwise everything is useless, first love, then the heart will break, then live in depression
 to ab jab mujhe pyaar hoga main ghar basaa luungaa
 " shahid lambey samay tak abhinetri karina kapur ke saath rishte main rahe the
 The news is that Shahid's father actor Pankaj Kapoor is looking for a bride for him
 lekin shahid kaa kahana he, "mere pita mere liye ladki nahin dhund rahe hai
 Father does not pressurize me for anything
 na hi vah is kaam ke liye apane upar dabaav lenge
 " desh kii ek or airlines bandi ke kagaar par he
 Vijay Mallya's luxurious airlines Kingfisher had not even forgotten that now the Maran family's airlines are faltering due to lack of funds
 buudhvaar kii subah uski ek bhi udaan nahin ho saki
 The reason given was that the companies supplying fuel to the aircraft raised their hands
 unka kahana he ki spicejet ke paas unka kaaphi bakaayaa ho gaya he or ab udhaar dena sambhav nahin hoga
 After Wednesday's incident, there is now concern about the future of this private airline
 is airlines kii ek khaasiyat yah rahi he ki isane hi aam bhartiya ko vimaan main baithne kaa mauka diya or aviation industry ko ek disha di
 But today it needs support
 lagaataar ghate main rahane ke kaaran iskaa vittiya swasthya chaupat ho gaya he
 It also returned leased aircraft to cut costs and canceled flights on several routes
 phir bhi isaki haalat main sudhaar nahin ho rahaa
 Now it needs at least Rs 1500 crore to run it completely
 yah rakam itani badi he ki maaran bandhu apni ore se nahin laga sakate
 Right now they are caught in the legal dispute of aircel-maxim and the CBI
 unka audyogic samrajya ladkadaa rahaa he or aise main itani badi rakam ugaahna turant sambhav nahin hoga
 The government is trying to get some loans so that it can run its operations smoothly
 spicejet koi choti-moti airlines nahin he, yah desh-videsh ke 46 shaharon main udaan bharti he
 It employs 20,000 people directly or indirectly
 is airlines ke band ho jane par unke pariwaron kaa kya hoga, is bare main bhi sochna hoga
 It would be wrong to act on it only by stating that the airlines are not able to repay the loan
 kingfisher ke doobane se kitne pariwaron par gaaj giri yah sabhi jaanate hai
 But it would be appropriate to have a look at why this problem arose
 sarkaar ne nijee airlinon ko udaan bharne kii ijaajat to de di lekin koi samuchit aviation policy nahin banaai
 Jet fuel prices were so high that airlines became thinner
 rajyon main to is par 20 fisadi se bhi zyada waite laga hua he
 This is government loot
 is tarah se waite lagaana saraasar galat he
 State governments do not find ways to earn revenue, so they arbitrarily impose tax on petrol and diesel
 doosraa maamla he nae airport kaa, jahaan airlinon ko bahut kiraaya dena pad rahaa he
 Employee salaries have been increasing and other expenses have also increased
 aise main ve kaise apane ko laabhadaayak sthiti main rakh sakati hai? videshi nivesh ke raste main bhi bahut rode hai or vahaan se paisa laana koi aasaan kaam nahin he
 However, it is very important to keep spicejet alive and for this, its promoters will have to invest further
 ve bainkon ke karj ke bharose nahin rah sakate
 On the other hand, the government should formulate a proper and comprehensive foreign policy and reduce the huge VAT imposed on jet fuel
 yah industry desh ke liye jaruri he or isamen rojgaar dene kii apaar sambhaavna he
 It is to be hoped that the government will take far-reaching decisions in this regard and not just by giving loans to Spyset, will be able to confirm its duty
 patni shrikala reddy ke bhartiya janata party (bijepi) main shaamil hone ke baad purvanchal ke bahubali netaa or purv saansad dhananjay singh ek phir charchaa main aa gaye hai

 The court underlined the lack of authority and said that there was no strong evidence to prove the arguments against the accused

Cut-off dates, first cum first serve On several issues such as Theory, the prosecution court could not provide evidence of any criminal conspiracy against the accused
 abhiyojan paksh kii daleel, gavaahon ke bayaan or pesh kiye gaye saboot ke bich talmail hi nahin dikhaa
 Therefore, the court acquitted all the accused

 Are the Hindus of India not being encouraged by saying that Muslims are living here because of their permission, their kindness, their greatness? Questions are rising in the minds of people like me, are we really free?

 The central government has announced the disinvestment of Air India, but only organizations associated with the BJP and the Sangh Parivar are standing against it
 sawaal bas yah he ki kya ve apane virodh ko aisi dhar denge ki sarkaar ko faisla waapas lene par majaboor kar saken? rss-linked Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh held a meeting against selling part of Air India

 All the workers will be absorbed after disinvestment

 " tippaniyan In the recent times, there have been many decisions of the Central Government which have been opposed by the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh
 lekin sawaal yah he ki yah virodh dikhaave kaa he yaa isse sarkaar kii nitiyon par asar bhi padegaa? The opposition of the rss-linked trade union Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh is raising many questions
 yah saaf darshata he ki sangh parivaar ke andar vinievesh ke masale par ek raay nahin he
 The Left-backed CITU has already expressed its opposition against the disinvestment of Air India

 aap kitne dalit cricketron ko jaanate hai? cricket bhadrajanon kaa khel to he hi, par kya savarnon kaa khel bhi he? isaki vistrut padtaal karti he itihaaskaar or lekhak ramchandra guha kii nai kitaab 'videshi khel apane maidan par'
 The veteran writer has tried to do a sociological analysis of cricket in this book
 'penguin' se prakashit is kitaab main unhone bhartiya cricket main nasl, dharm, jati or rashtrawaad ke asar ko aankane kii koshish kii he
 Also talked about the anonymous cricketers of Indian cricket history in detail
 isi kitaab ke silsile main unka yah intervyuu pesh-e-najar he
 Question: You have talked about how the game of cricket was affected during the Partition period in your book 'foreign Sports on your ground' published by Penguin Hindi
 bharat-pakistan ke bantwaare kaa upmahadweep ke cricket par kya mukhya asar rahe? ek ekikrut cricket team kaa vishwa cricket main kya sthaan rahaa hota? kya bhavishya main deshon ke alag-alag astitv ke saath, kisi ekikrut team kii aap koi sambhaavna dekhte hai?jawaab:agar bharat kaa vibhaajan nahin hota to shaayad ham duniya kii sabase shaktishaalee cricket team ban jate
 Take the seventies
 bharat ke batting line-ap main gavaskar or miyandad, vishwanath or zahir hote
 Imran Khan and Sarfraz Nawaz would have been the openers and bowling would have started with Bedi and then Chandrasekhar
 dukh kii baat he ki ye kalpana thi or kalpana rahegi
 There is no possibility of India and Pakistan ever becoming a unified team
 bas aap aashaa or kaamana kar sakate hai ki donon deshon ke bich khele jane vaale cricket match atyadhik katutaa kii bhaavana se na khele jaaen
 Question: You have been a critic of IPL
 yah khel ko kis tarah nuksaan pahunchaa rahaa he? yah itnaa mahatvapurn khel kaise ban gaya or kya aapako lagata he ki isane puraani style ke test maichon ko baari nuksaan pahunchaaya he? ipel kaise itani badi parighatna ban gaya?jawaab:ipel ke bare main meraa virodh cricket, saamaajik or naitik he
 20-20 matches are not real cricket
 boundry haasyaaspad rup se choti he (taaki chakke aasaani se jade ja saken)
 Batsmen do not play all their strokes and only play cross-bat and ball bouncing shots
 or haa, gendbaazon ko apane wicket chatakaane ke hunar ko dikhaane kaa mauka bahut kam miltaa he
 At the social level, the IPL has created a deep gap between the city and the village, increasing the distance between economically over-developed and under-developed areas, as well as increasing distance between the professional and the working class
 aisa kyon he ki maharashtra kii do ipel timen hai or uttar pradesh kii ek bhi nahin
 When India plays as an India, all citizens can enjoy it and can feel the excitement of the game
 par ipel ke match dekhne vaale zyaadaatar ucch varg ke hote hai
 Finally, it is surprising that most of the progressive and innovative Indian companies have no IPL team
 tata, mahindra or aisi duusari companiyaan isse dur rahi hai
 On the other hand, IPL teams have been promoted by notorious industrialists who benefit from close ties to politicians and industrialists who do not pay salaries to their employees
 mere vichaar main ipel cricket ke or saath hi saath bhartiya samaaj ke badtareen pahalu ko ujagar karata he
 Question: As it can be known through your book that cricket had strengthened the ongoing national independence movement in its own way
 cricket ke bare main kya yahi baat raashtra ke nirmaan ke daur ke bare main kahi ja sakati he? or aaj jab raashtra ek nae daur kii taraf teji se bad rahaa he, aap isamen cricket kii kya bhoomika dekhte hai? kya cricket se aisi koi ummid rakhi bhi ja sakati he?jawaab:bharat jab ek upnivesh tha, or isaki aazaadee ke pehle kuch dashakon main bhi, cricket ne rashtravaadi aakankshaon ke saadhan ke rup main bhoomika nibhaai thi
 That is why CK Naidu's century (which included 11 sixes) against an MCC team in 1926-27 triggered such widespread acclaim and the Prime Minister met cricketers after our victory in 1971
 ek baar phir, 1990 ke dashak main, kargil yuddh or kashmir main vidroh ke dashak main, bharat or pakistan ke bich honevaale match raajnneetik arth liye hue hote the
 But now seeing that we are now a seven-decade-old nation, we should be less superstitious and see it only as a game
 agar ham australia se yaa phir pakistan tak se ek match yaa siries haarate hai, to isse hamaara rashtriya maan jaraa bhi prabhavit nahin hona chahie
 Question: You have been writing on environment and political history
 bharat main cricket ke itihaas par kitaab likhane kaa vichaar kaise aayaa?jawaab:yah kareeb-kareeb ek sanyog tha
 i planned to write a book on the Bombay Panchkonee competition (formerly Chatushkoniyathi)
 yah 1912 se 1945 ke bich hamaari pramukh cricket pratiyogita thi
 It was even more important then the Ranji Trophy
 pehle mahaan bhartiya test cricketron sike
 Naidu, Vijay Merchant, Mushtaq Ali, Muhammad Nisar, Amar Singh, Vijay Hazare, Veenu Mankad had left their marks in it
 meri kitaab kaa uddeshy ek cricket itihaas hona tha, jisamen pariyon tathaa haare or jite gaye maichon par dhyaan kendrit karnaa tha
 But the more research i went on, the more i saw that there were intertwined with quadrangular and five-pronged politics and society
 isliye aakhir main maine ek aisi kitaab likhi, jisamen nasl, dharm, jati or rashtrawaad khud cricket jitne hi mahatvapurn the
 Question: This is the first time so much material has been available about Dalit bowler Palwankar Balu
 baaluu ko kitaab ke centre main rakhane ke peeche kya khyaal tha?jawaab:yah shodh ke dauraan, iske bheetar se hi ubhar kar aayaa
 In Mumbai, i met Balu's nephew, who handed over precious family documents to me (including a memoir printed in Marathi) and shared with me the memories of his uncle and his father Vitthal (balu's younger brother and a talented batsman)
 iske baad tab ke ek agrani rashtravaadi akhbaar bombai chronical kii micro filmein dekhte hue maine donon bhaaiyon ke nijee sangharshon par dilachasp saamagree pai
 Both these brothers were the finest Hindu cricketers of their time, but being from a Dalit background they were denied adequate acceptance
 khud bombai chronical ne baaluu or vitthal ke sammaan ke andolan kaa netritv kiya
 After that i also found new and hitherto unseen reports about Balu's close and complex relationship with BR Ambedkar
 is tarah aakhirkaar baaluu is kitaab ke kendriya vishay ban gaye or main sochataa hum ki ve puri tarah iske laayak hai
 Because he was a brilliant cricketer as well as a remarkable human being
 tarksangat rup se ve pratik ban jane vaale bharat ke pehle khilaadi the or isi ke saath ve 1910 se 1930 ke bich pashchimi bharat main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn dalit hasti bhi the
 Question: The major part of your book is about the struggle of the underprivileged in cricket
 aisi pehali koshishon ke kareeb ek shatabdi baad, daliton ke maamle main bhartiya cricket aaj kahaan khadaa he? yah kitna samaveshi hua he?jawaab:baaluu or unke bhaaiyon ke baad vanchit tabakon se kuch behtareen cricketer aae the
 After 1947, perhaps three or four Dalits played Test cricket for India, but none achieved fame
 mujhe yakeen he ki ab tak koi adivasee yaa uttar-purv se koi bharat ke liye nahin khelaa he
 So, while sports fans in the Indian team consist of people from all classes and religions, the players who play at the top level are widely drawn from cities and upper castes
 bhartiya cricket team main raashtra kii saamaajik or bhugolic vividhta kaa puraa pratinidhitiv nahin he
 Question: You have presented the history of a game in the association of political and social history
 kya kabhi aapako laga ki khel kaa koi itihaas raajnneetik or saamaajik itihaas ke pare bhilikha ja saktaa he? agar aisa ek itihaas likhaa jaae to vah kaisaa hoga?jawaab:maine jo likhaa he vah bhartiya cricket kaa saamaajik or raajnneetik itihaas he, jise nasl, jati, dharm or raashtra kii ‘pradhan shreniyon’ ke jariye likhaa gaya he
 For the new edition, i have added a whole new chapter on the impact of market and business on cricket (as seen in the IPL)
 haalanki aisa itihaas likhnaa sambhav he jo saamaajik ayaamon ko bich main laae bina, khud khel par apana dhyaan kendrit kare
 i would love if someone wrote a biography of Chakki who ruled the game after the period of Balu and Vitthal: CK Naidu, Vijay Merchant, Vijay Hazare and Veenu Mankad
 ye sabhi bemisaal cricketer the, jinhen antarrashtriya manch par bahut kam avasar hasil hue
 There is a cricketer study in my mind, which then analyzes their batting and bowling style in terms of what the game used to be, which analyzes their main achievements on the field, etc
 naidu, virender sahvaag jaisi maharath se gendbaajon kii dhulaai kar sakate the
 Merchant and Hazare were the best batsmen in Rahul Dravid's mold
 or vinu mankad tarksangat rup se kapil dev se bhi mahaan harfanmaulaa the
 He was the first great Indian cricketer and a proper assessment of this greatness is yet to be done
 ummid karata hum ki koi yuva lekhak is kaam ko apane haath main legaa
 Jamshedpur in Jharkhand has come to terms with the extent of life
 railway stesan par apni maa ke paas so rahi 3 saal kii bacchee ko ek shaks ne agava kar apane dost ke saath rape kiya

 centre sarkaar ne supreme court main halafanama daakhil kar kaha he ki abhi tak aisa koi thos saboot saamne nahin aayaa he, jisase pataa chale ki mobile radiation se logon ko asar padataa he
 There has been a lot of research all over the world about Electro Magnetic Field Radiation i
e
 EMF and about 25 thousand articles have also been published in the last 30 years
 haal hi ke research ke baad WHO is nattejey par pahunchaa he ki abhi tak mili saboot ye sabit nahin karte ki radiation se logon ke swasthya par asar pasta he
 On 24 August 2010, a committee was also formed in this regard, which was asked to investigate the radiation coming from mobile phones to the base station
 cameti ne desh or videshon main hui paryaavaran or swasthya sambandhi research ko dekhne ke baad apni report main kaha ki lab main hui zyaadaatar research se ye sabit nahin hota ki EMF or swasthya ke bich main koi sidhaa sambandh he
 These researches have not been able to prove that the health of people is adversely affected due to radiation
 tippaniyan Actually, the Supreme Court is hearing a petition filed for radiation emanating from mobile towers
 pichhali sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne sakht rukh apanaate hue kaha tha ki aam logon ke paas aisa yantra hona chahie, jo pataa laga sake ki radiation kaa str kya he? court ne kaha he ki mobile toweron se nikalne vaale radiation se pakshi gaayab ho rahe hai
 Or there should be a system, so that people know about radiation
 court ne yah bhi kaha ki radiation ko lekar logon ke man main jo dar he vah dur hona chahie
 What is the standard regarding government's radiation in the country as compared to abroad? Are there violations of rules regarding mobile tower radiation, action taken? The court had asked the Center to answer some questions whether a study was ever done about the radiation of the mobile tower as to how it affects people and birds
 Has the government set any limit for radiation? supreme court mobile toweron se hone vaali radiation ko lekar daakhil yachikaaon par sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 On behalf of the petitioner, Prashant Bhushan has said in the Supreme Court that the parliamentary party had said that towers should be removed from places where the population is more, but the Center did nothing
 electro magnetic field radiation yani EMF ko lekar duniyabar main khub research hui hai or pichley 30 saal main kareeb 25 hajaar artical bhi chape hai
 After recent research, WHO has come to the conclusion that the evidence so far does not prove that radiation affects people's health
 24 agast 2010 ko is bare main ek cameti kaa gathan bhi kiya tha, jise mobile phone se lekar base stesan tak nikalne vaali radiation kii chaanbin karne ko kaha gaya tha
 After looking at the environmental and health research conducted in the country and abroad, the committee said in its report that most of the research conducted in the lab does not prove that there is a direct connection between EMF and health
 ye research ye sabit nahin kar pai hai ki radiation kii vajah se logon ke swasthya par pratikul asar pasta he
 The comments darasal, supreme court mobile toweron se nikalne vaale radiation ko lekar daayar yachika par sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 During the last hearing, the court had taken a tough stand and said that common people should have such a device, which can find out what the level of radiation is? The court has said that the birds are disappearing from the radiation emanating from the mobile towers
 yaa koi system hona chahie, jisase logon ko radiation kaa pataa chale
 The court also said that the fear in the minds of people about radiation should be removed
 videshon kii tulana main desh main sarkaar ke radiation ko lekar kya standard he? kya mobile tower radiation ko lekar niyamon kaa ulanghan hua he, kya ection liya gaya? court ne centre ko kuch sawaalon ke jawaab dene ko kaha tha ki kya kabhi mobile tower kii radiation ko lekar koi study kii gai ki iskaa logon or pakshiyon par kya asar padataa he? kya sarkaar ne radiation kii koi limit tay kii he? The Supreme Court is hearing petitions filed for radiation from mobile towers
 yachikakarta kii ore se prashanth bhushan ne supreme court main kaha he ki sansadeey dal ne kaha tha ki jin jagahon par jansankhya zyada he, vahaan se toweron ko hataaya jaae, lekin centre ne kuch nahin kiya

 darasal, supreme court mobile toweron se nikalne vaale radiation ko lekar daayar yachika par sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 During the last hearing, the court had taken a tough stand and said that common people should have such a device, which can find out what the level of radiation is? The court has said that the birds are disappearing from the radiation emanating from the mobile towers
 yaa koi system hona chahie, jisase logon ko radiation kaa pataa chale
 The court also said that the fear in the minds of people about radiation should be removed
 videshon kii tulana main desh main sarkaar ke radiation ko lekar kya standard he? kya mobile tower radiation ko lekar niyamon kaa ulanghan hua he, kya ection liya gaya? court ne centre ko kuch sawaalon ke jawaab dene ko kaha tha ki kya kabhi mobile tower kii radiation ko lekar koi study kii gai ki iskaa logon or pakshiyon par kya asar padataa he? kya sarkaar ne radiation kii koi limit tay kii he? The Supreme Court is hearing petitions filed for radiation from mobile towers

 kya bhartiya sena kii karrwai se baukhalaayaa he pakistan
 Is there a foolish Pakistan that is targeting our citizens? yah sawaal sena pramukh general bipin ravat ke bayaan se uthte hai
 After meeting Home Minister Rajnath Singh, General Bipin Rawat said that Pakistan is deliberately targeting our civilians while we are not doing so

 General Bipin Rawat said that when Pakistan is suffering, it tries to hurt us
 hamaare civillian ko torget karte he, jabaki ham civillian ko torget nahin karte hai
 Actually, Generalbipin Rawatka's gesture is towards the action of the Indian Army, in which many posts, oil depots and launching pads of Pakistan have been destroyed across the loc in the Indian Army's operations
 jisase pakistan baukhalaayaa hua he
 In areas adjoining the loc, civilians are being asked to evacuate their homes and move to safer places
 aisa kar pakistan nagarikon main dehshat kaa maahaul kaayam kar rahaa he
 It is clear from the statement of Army Chief Bipin Rawat that the Indian Army is giving a befitting reply to every action of its kind
 saath hi agar pakistan koi duusare tareeke kii gustaakhee karata he to usko bhi munhtod jawaab bhartiya sena detii rahegi
 In the manner in which Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI and the Pakistan Army are engaged in trying to infiltrate Jammu and Kashmir, India needs to be more alert

 (input bhashaa se) Supreme Court Orders m \ Mediation in Ayodhya Case: Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute (ayodhya Dispute) will be arbitrated
 supreme court ne aapasi samjhaute ke zariye hal nikaalane kaa rasta saafe kar diya he
 After the Supreme Court approved the arbitration in the Ayodhya case, the firebrand leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party and Union Minister Uma Bharti said that this country is secular, hence the construction of the grand temple, where Ram Lala sits
 It is possible
 bataa den ki supreme court ne sevanivrutt nyaayadhish epa em ai kaliphulla ko madhyasthata ke liye gathit teen sadasyeey samiti kaa adhyaksh niyukt kiya he, jinamein aadhyatmik guru shri shri ravishankar or varisht adhivaktaa shriram panchu bhi shaamil hai
 Union Minister Uma Bharti told NDTV India that 'I have been associated with Ram temple movement and my parents have also been taking the name of Ram
 is desh main karodon logon ke mata-pita ram kaa naam lete rahe hai or abhi bhi le rahe hai
 They will only see the Ram temple there, so the team is formed
 ham team ke adhikaar ko chunauti nahin de sakate
 'union Minister Uma Bharti said after the Supreme Court's decision on the Ayodhya issue that i respect the Supreme Court, but where Ramlalla is sitting, only a grand Ram temple can be constructed
 yah desh dharmanirpeksh he, lekin jis tarah vatican main koi masjid, yaa makka main koi carch nahin bana saktaa, vaise hi ayodhya main bhi mandir ke alaava kuch or nahin ban saktaa
 "uma Bharti said that 'we cannot raise any question on the Supreme Court because it is God's temple for us
 lekin meraa ek adhikaar he or us adhikaar ko koi chunauti nahin de saktaa, vah yah he ki vahaan par ramalala baithe hai, unki puja ho rahi he or vahaan bhavy mandir kaa nirmaan hi hoga
 The rest are mosques in Faizabad, prayers are being offered in India
 ham unka bahut sammaan karte hai
 There is no problem listening to the sound of all five times on Mike
 vahaan ram mandir hi hoga
 He said that we respect the team made by the Supreme Court
 uma bharti ne kaha ki yodhya main baaki sabhi masjid kaa sammaan, agar wo bigadi to unke liye kuch paisa main bhej duungi lekin us jagah par to mandir bananaa chahie
 Even before this, there have been efforts in Akbar's time, but this is an attempt of the Supreme Court to congratulate it
 uma bharti se yah poochne par ki loksabhaa chunaav ab kabhi bhi ghoshit ho sakate hai
 During this time you think there will be politics on this, because time has been given
 is dauraan baat hogi yaa nahin hogi raajnneeti par? unhone kaha ki ' main enditivi ko suzav duungi ki vah ayodhya main ram mandir kii charchaa na hi kare to acha he
 And through NDTV, i will tell the entire media that do not connect it to the election, it is your religion too, that it is our religion, which is empty? It will be in Faizabad and the process should start within a week
 samvidhan peeth ke anya sadasyon main nyaayamurti es e bobade, nyaayamurti di vaai chandrachud, nyaayamurti ashok bhushan or nyaayamurti es abdul nazeer shaamil hai
 The bench said that the arbitration committee would file a progress report of its proceedings within four weeks
 peeth ne kaha ki yah prakriya aath saptaah ke bheetar puri ho jaani chahie
 The court said that "utmost secrecy" should be exercised to ensure the success of the arbitration proceedings and the print and electronic media would not report the proceedings
 peeth ne kaha ki madhyasthata samiti isamen or adhik sadasyon ko shaamil kar sakati he or is sambandh main kisi bhi tarah kii pareshaani kii sthiti main samiti ke adhyaksh sheersh adaalat kii registry ko isaki jaankaree denge

 It was as physical as they were free from body

 The phone was cordless then, but not mobile
 smart to dur kii baat thi
 They both met through the pleasant surprise of the "machine", which is now called the cross connection, mistaken number, and the old and missing
 vah paki hui kishor umr main tha
 His voice was getting heavier, but the man had not been heard yet
 isiilie us duusare aadmi (beshak vah aadmi tha, yahaan tak ki bhala aadmi) ne, jisase vah galati se jud gai line ke us duusare chor par ittefaq se mil gaya tha, use lubhaavni thodi baari or phir bhi ajeeb dhang se maasoom aawaaj vaali aurat samaj liya
 The boy also had a feeling of deformity and he did not tell the man the right thing
 bas ve ek-duusare se baaten karte rahe
 It was an obsessive and erotic romance that lasted for nearly 10 years without ever meeting him face to face in reality
 us dauraan us aadmi ke liye vah ladkaa aurat ban gaya, jiskaa naam ananyaa tha
 He — that is, man — said that he was called Anitya
 anitya ne ananyaa ko bataaya ki vah 35 ke aasapaas kaa ek doctor he
 married
 ek betaa bhi he
 They used to talk endlessly over the phone for many years, often in the afternoon, sometimes late at night, in which they would share such things among themselves which are not worth writing here
 unki baaten kaamuk ho uthatin
 Both would get excited
 ladkaa aksar khud ko or anitya ko skhalan tak le aata
 Then one day Anitya gave Ananya's number to another man, then to a third and then to a fourth as well
 in sabake saath vah jo karti, vah mahaj ''phone sex" nahin tha
 There was something else, more than that, whose foundation rested on mixed pampering, curiosity and compulsion
 ve usase milane ko lalayit the, par ananyaa ne hathpurvak aisi peshkash thukraa di
 Soon they get caught in his entourage and she gets caught in his entourage
 un das saalon ke dauraan ladkaa bada ho gaya, par vah bada hokar aisa praani ban gaya jise duniya puraa aadmi to nahin hi kahegi
 He began having "real" relationships with men, or should i say, not even of his own gender (gender), but with other members of his own sex (sex)
 vah tamaam kism kii jagahon par unase miltah tram, basen, park, sadaken, shauchalay, partiyaan, hotel, librari, daftar or ghar
 Technology was also changing rapidly
 assi kaa dashak nabbe ke dashak main badal gaya or phir uskaa badalanaa bhi bematlab ho gaya
 Mobile arrived
 internet bhi aa gaya
 The two became one and gave birth to a new smartness
 uske saath hi ananyaa dhire-dhire or bilkul swaabhaavik tareeke se virtual yaa abhaasi or uski anant sambhaavnaaon kii aam roshni main gaayab ho gai
 Slowly and naturally, the other man also disappeared
 unke saath hi bila gai unki dabi-chhipi lalak, unki vaasana or bharose kaa ajeeb ghalmail, unki apurit vyakul laalasaa, biviyon, bacchon, maanon, pitaaon, padosiyon or doston se aabaad unki jindagi kii shandaar vividhtaon se bhari kahaniyaan
 Ananya was just as fascinated by these stories as she was of the sex with her on the phone
 vah to yahaan tak kahati ki use sex se zyada in kahaniyon kii lat thi
 At some point in the new millennium, Ananya again turned into an LGBTQ activist
 ab uski apni ''pahchaan" thi, jo ek saath kachi or pakki, nijee or siyaasi, saarvajanik or peshewar thi
 It was an identity that many found difficult to turn into a polite and possible third personal pronoun
 yah teesraa ling-bhed passport or sansadon main daakhil gaya
 Special and favorable meanings of section 377 were derived and then dismissed
 echivi ek aisi cheez main badal gaya, jisase marane ke bajaae uske saath rahaa ja saktaa tha
 But Anand misses Ananya
 vah aksar yah sochakar hairaan hota ki 21veen sadi kii aazaadiyon or ganit kii vidhiyon main uske gaayab hone ke saath aakhir kya khoyaa, kya paaya
 His phone now had both Grindr and Tinder
 internet kii kai dating citon par khud apni tasveeron or byoron ke saath uski kai aaidi thim
 He had also met and had sex with homosexual, heterosexual men, bisexuals and men who had no idea of who, what, or who they were
 usne unhen bataane kii koi ichha bhi mahasoos nahin kii
 Sometimes these meetings were so frequent that they turned into friendships
 dostiyon main kaamuktha bani rahi, yaa ve kamvasana se aage ek kism kii siharan or uttejnaa bhari sahajata or anand kii taraf le gayi
 He often teases his married friends (heterosexual and homosexual) by saying that sex with the same person is more unnatural than anal sex
 usne kabhi lambey vakt kaa ''saathi" nahin chaha
 He found this word boringly non-gay
 anand kabhi-kabhaar jab bhi ananyaa or uske saath beete un alokik puraane dinon ko yaad kar udhaas hota, tab use uskaa gaayab hona samalangik kii maut kii tarah lagata, jo cheshair cat kii tarah duniya se ojhal ho gaya jaan padataa tha, apane peeche banaavati hansi nahin balki vah cheez chhodkar, jise ''gender" yaa ling-bhed kaha jaataa he
 He did not like this word
 vah ''sex" yaa yon ko tarjeeh detaa tha
 It was less antiseptic
 assi ke dashak kii un dupehriyon main yaa internet ke shuruaati saalon main bhi jo sambhaavna uske saamne khuli thi, vah khud ko ijad karne ke kahin zyada buniyadi tareekon kii shuruyaat thi
 Webcams and phone cameras everywhere after them provided those videha or bodiless text and sounds to their neighbors and even a name
 sachaai kaa makasad beshak puraa ho gaya he
 But the stories that weighed together on the wireless phone, the thing that came out blossomed, it was probably the possibility of self or of itself that shimmered in the murky precinct between reality and apocalypse, truth and lies
 kya yah niraa phantasy yaa kalpana kaa ghanaa ahaata rahaa ho saktaa tha, jise kisi or ne nahin balki us baawale, us premi or us kavi ne hi gadha tha? aakhirkaar kya yah shakespeare kaa hi ek masakhra nahin tha jisane is puure tamzam kii ijad hone se bahut pehle daawa kiya tha ki sabase sachhee kavita hi sabase dhongi kavita thi?(avik sen kii research, lekhak, shikshak, curator, patrkaar ke taur par kai khubiyaan hai or inke jariye unki kala, sahitya, cinema, sangeet or samaaj main barabari se paith he
