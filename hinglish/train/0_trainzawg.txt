 co / axdqhd5vhs iran kii sansad ne maanavtaa, stri adhikaron or bacchon ke adhikaron ke munh par tamaacha maarthe hue ek bill paas kiya he, jiske mutabik koi bhi purush apni god lee hui beti se shaadi kar saktaa he
 The only legal trick for this is that the age of this adopted daughter should not be less than 13 years
 iran kii sansad kaa daawa he ki is krantikari faisle ke baad bacchon ke adhikaron kii raksha ho sakegi
 After this decision of Parliament, human rights activists have feared that the harassment of children will increase further because the male head of the family will have to prove in court that he is marrying his adopted daughter for his own good
 ghinaune kanoonon ke tahat ho rahaa irani bacchiyon kaa shoshan13 saal kii umr kii ladki yah bhi tay karne kii sthiti main nahin hoti ki vah jindagi main koun si raah pakadana chaahati he
 What does she want to be when she grows up? is vakt tak uske sharir kaa vikaas bhi thik se shuru nahin ho paata he
 But in Iran, this is the age when he can be legally married
 ladakon ke maamle main yah umr 15 saal he
 Not only this, even a girl under 13 years of age can be married in Iran
 iske liye uske mata-pita ko bas ek jaj ke saamne yachika daakhil kar kaaran bataate hue anumati leni hoti he
 According to an Iranian news website, in 2010 itself, 42 thousand children between the ages of 10 and 14 were married
 iran kaa tark, hijaab se mukti dilaane ko liya yah faislabacchon ke adhikaron kii raksha ke naam par paas kiye gaye is bill ko abhi iran kii gardian council se paarit hona he
 After this it will become law
 is council main muslim dharmaguru kanoon ke dharmik pahalu par vichaar karte hai
 Opposing the bill, London-based group Justice for Iran activist Saadi Sadr said it was directly a case of sexual exploitation and rape of children
 england ke akhbaar da gargian se baat karte hue saadi ne kaha ki abhi tak kaa koi bhi kanoon kisi purush ko apni god lee hui beti se shaadi kii ijaajat nahin detaa tha
 Its scope has been given in the new bill
 unhone kaha ki iran kii samskruti apane hi bacchon se shaadi kii ijaajat nahin detii he
 On the other hand, Iranian officials are not even paying attention to the aspect of sexual abuse
 unka maananaa he ki is bill kaa makasad god lee hui bacchiyon ko ghar main hijaab pahanane kii baadhyataa se mukti dilaanaa he
 Actually, there is a law in Iran that an adopted daughter has to wear a hijab in front of her father, while her mother has to wear a hijab in front of the adopted son, if the son is of the age of adult

 The Board of Governors of the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) headed by Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani, in its meeting on 27 October, had decided that 'german language studies will be stopped with the option of Sanskrit
 ’ german ko chaatro ke liye atirikt vishay ke taur par rakhaa gaya he
 The decision will affect more than 70,000 students in classes six to eight of all 500 Kendriya Vidyalayas
 unhen ab german kii bajaae sanskrit kii padhai kerani hogi
 Challenging the judgment, the petitioners said, 'kendriya Vidyalayas did not consider it appropriate to look into the fact that such a decision could not be taken in the mid-term session as it would disturb the entire academic preparedness of the affected students
 ’ unhone kaha tha, ‘sarkaar ko aise samay main or prabhavit chaatro tathaa abhibhavakon ke saath bina kisi mashvira ke is tarah kaa bina sochaa samajha or manamaana faisla nahin lenaa chahie
 The petition argued that the decision was taken by the defendants to remove the German language in place of Sanskrit in all kvs across the country without considering the interest and benefit of students studying in such kvs

 (from input language) aaj hi ke din dilli ko bharat kii rajdhani banane kaa elaan kiya gaya tha
 Calcutta (now Kolkata) was made the capital of India before Delhi
 jiske baad 13 farvari 1931 ko dilli ko aadhikarik taur par rajdhani ghoshit kiya gaya
 Learn how Delhi became the capital of India
 
 
 - us samay bharat ke shaasha king jorge pancham ne 12 disambar 1911 main dilli darbar main isaki aadharshila rakhi thi
 The new city was later planned by British architects Sir Herbert Baker and Sir Edwin Lutyens
 is yojana ko puraa karne main do dashak lag gaye the
 After which on 13 February 1931, Delhi officially became the capital of the country
 kahin is 'maut ke khel' ke jhaanse main to nahin fansaa aapkaa baccha, aise sanbhaalein- jo dilli shahar aaj bharat kii rajdhani ke rup main janaa jaataa he, uske naam ko lekar kai kahaniyaan mashhoor hai
 Some people believe that the word Delhi came from the Persian 'dehlij' because Delhi was a 'dehlij' for the plains of the Ganges
 - vahiin kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki dilli kaa naam tomars raja dhillu ke naam par dilli padaa
 There is also an opinion that to prove a curse false, King Dhillu tried to carve a nail buried in the foundation of this city
 is ghatana ke baad unke rajpaat kaa to ant ho gaya lekin mashhoor hui ek kahawat, killi to dhilli bhai, tomars hue matihin, jisase dilli ko uskaa naam mila
 - It is believed that the Pandavas settled Delhi for the first time as 'indraprastha' in 1450 BC
 aaazaad bharat main jab bina samvidhan ke 29 maheene tak chalaa desh-jab dilli ko bharat kii rajdhani banane kaa elaan kiya tha us vakt dilli bahut pichhadi thi
 Metros like Mumbai, Kolkata and Madras (now Chennai) were far ahead in everything
 yahaan tak ki lakhanu or hyderabad bhi dilli se behatar maane jate the
 Only 3 percent of Delhi's population could read English
 - isi vajah se videshi dilli bhi ghoomane kam aate the

 Film Name: Gali Gulia Director: Dipesh jainstar Cast: Manoj Bajpayee, Neeraj Kabi, Shahana Goswami, Om Singh, Ranveer Shorey Period: 1 hour 57 minutes Certificates: u / a Rating: 4 Starpesh Dipesh Jain named 'in the Shadows' in 2016
 The film was directed
 yah film bahut saare festivels main gai or kai jagahon par alag-alag award bhi jite
 After all, it is now being released in India under the name of "galli-gulian"
 manoj bajpeyi or niraj kabi ne film main mukhya bhoomika nibhaai he
 Let's know how the film is after all
 kahani:film kii kahani puraani dilli kii galiyon se shuru hoti he jahaan ek electrician khuddus (manoj bajpeyi) rahata he
 In his neighborhood, there is always a father (neeraj Kabi) brutally beating his son (om Singh)
 jo baat khuddus ko bilkul pasand nahin aati
 He wants to help the child in some way
 vah samay-samay par apane dost (ranvir shouri) kii madad bhi letaa he jiske saath hi kahani main kai saare pahalu ujagar hote hai
 After all, what causes that merciless father to kill his son, and can the suicide save the child from this violence? You have to watch the film to know this
 jaaniye aakhir film ko kyon dekh sakate hai:film kii khubi isaki kahani he jo kai paraton se hoti hui, antat ek sarprize par khatm hoti he
 The direction is amazing and the way Dipesh Jain has shown the streets of Delhi, it does not seem that this is his first film
 film kii cinemetography badhiya he
 Viewers will find themselves fully involved in the story
 screenple kaaphi acha likhaa gaya he or parat-dar-parat jab chijen khulti hai to kahani sochane par vivash karti he
 Sometimes drone is the use of the camera, sometimes things get sharper in long shot and project
 manoj bajpeyi ne electrician ke kaam ko bakhubi nibhaayaa he
 Seems to be completely engrossed in the character
 isi ke saath beraham pita kaa kirdaar niraj kabi ne saraahneey tareeke se nibhaayaa he jisaki vajah se shaayad aap unase ghrinaa bhi karne lage
 For the first time, Om Singh is working in a film
 asal jindagi main vah ek anathalay se laayaa gaya baccha he jise film main deepesh jain or manoj bajpeyi ne kaam karavaaya he
 Om Singh is seen acting quite natural
 ranvir shouri or shahana goswami ne bhi sahaj abhinay kiya he
 Weak Links: This is not a typical masala film, due to which perhaps a certain kind of audience would like to see this film
 saath hi saath box offis par yah 100 yaa 200 karod kamaane vaali film nahin he
 But due to the acting and the story, it will definitely be appreciated
 film kaa koi aisa geet bhi nahin he jo relies se pehle prasiddh hua ho
 This is why audiences who pay attention to acting and story will also be able to find this film in theaters nearby
 box offis:film kaa bajet zyada nahin he, lekin isaki khaas tarah kii audiyans khud-ba-khud cinemaghar tak pahunch jaaegi
 CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury has questioned the Election Commission
 aisa unhone chunaav ayog dwaara chah main se teen loksabhaa siton par upachunaavon kii ghoshnaa na karne kii vajah se kiya he
 The Election Commission has announced by-elections in Ajmer and Alwar in Rajasthan and Uluberia seat in West Bengal
 uttar pradesh kii gorakhpur or phulpur or bihar kii arriya seat par philhal upachunaavon kii ghoshnaa nahin kii gai he
 The seat of Gorakhpur in UP was vacated by UP CM Yogi Adityanath and Phulpur seat Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya moved to UP Assembly
 vahiin, arriya kii seat argedy ke netaa mohammad taslimuddin kii maut ke baad khaali hui thi
 Yechury has targeted the Election Commission for not declaring elections in all six seats
 unhone kaha he ki yahi cheez gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon main dekhne ko mili thi
 Yechury is referring to the considerable gaps in the assembly elections in Gujarat and Himachal
 raajnneetik dalon ne tab bhi chunaav ayog kii aalochana kii thi
 Yechury has made two tweets in this regard
 unhone kaha he ki gujarat ke baad loksabhaa siton par upachunaav karaane ko lekar bhi chunaav ayog par sawaal uth rahe hai
 He has said that the fairness of the Election Commission should not be questioned for democracy
 Moreover, the BJP talks about simultaneous polls across India when it runs scared about simultaneous polls in HP and Gujarat
 Or for Lok Sabha by-elections
 No one expects any better from the BJP but the EC must abide by its constitutional mandate
 - Sitaram Yechury (@sitaramyechury) January 1, 2018 In another tweet, Yechury has said that BJP talks about holding elections all over the country
 jabaki ise gujarat or himachal pradesh main ekasaath chunaav karaane main bhi dar lagata he
 They also feel the same fear in holding by-elections in all six Lok Sabha seats
 We saw it in the Gujarat assembly polls, and more questions about the Election Commission now in conduct of by-polls
 For the sake of our democracy, the ec's objectivity and impartiality can't be under a cloud

 He has created this image in the last few years through his films and his advertisements

 vaise akshay ne kai mahatvapurn muddon par bhi film banaai he
 But right now, people are questioning Modi's interview and saying that Akshay Kumar has been left in front of power

 kabhi aapane suna he ki itnaa bada khulaasa tamaam sarkaron ne milakar kiya ho
 Why is it only the journalist who puts his life at stake
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri or china ke raashtrapati shi chinafing kaa naam aayaa he
 While it is said that Chinfing is curbing corruption
 kai netaaon or sainik adhikariyon ko giraftaar kiya he
 But now questions are being raised on them
 isliye jo netaa yah kahe ki usne bhrashtachar samaapt kar diya he, zaraa thahar kar sochane kii zarurat he
 On the day corruption will end with politics, the leaders will go to rally demanding your car
 aapako khud hi pataa chal jayega
 According to the Indian Express newspaper, 500 Indians have been named in this list
 bharatiyon ko 2013 ke baad videshon main company banane kii ijazat mil gai thi
 It is alleged that before this many people had sent their money out through these front companies
 bharat main supreme court kii esaiti videshon main kaala dhan kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The Government of India has also enacted a law to disclose money deposited abroad
 sab hairaan hai ki abhi tak kisi bade bhartiya netaa kaa naam kaise nahin aayaa
 Our leaders are not even saying
 ve ek duusare ko lekar itane aashwast hai ki lokapal kii bhi maang nahin kar rahe hai
 It has been two years since Lokpal passed the law, yet the Lokpal has not even come
 khud hi log praaanpatr de rahe hai ki bhrashtachar samaapt ho gaya he
 However, after the Panama Leaks revelations, many countries of the world have been stirred up
 riters ne bataaya he ki newzealand or australia ke tex prashasan ne apane nagarikon kii jaanch shuru kar di he
 Australia says it has begun an investigation into 800 wealthy citizens
 france ke raashtrapati oland ne kaha he ki li main hue khulaase ko lekar jaanch karenge
 Sweden's tax administration has also said that they will take documents from news organizations and investigate
 panama liks main 400-500 sweden ke nagarikon ke bhi naam hai
 The name of the famous player Messi has also come
 mesi ne kaha he ki wo unka naam lene vaale akhabaaron ke khilaaf mukadmaa karenge
 Russia has said that this is a conspiracy to discredit
 kremlin ke pravaktaa ne kaha he ki yah is baat kaa pramaan he ki putin ko lekar phobia kis had tak bad gaya he
 When nothing is found, then the next negative thing starts
 tippaniyan wikileaks also made several revelations before Panama Leaks
 jitani karrwai nahin hui usase zyada patrakaron ko darbadar hona padaa
 How much was said in India that black money is abroad
 laane ke naam par kadaa kanoon banaakar unheen se nivedan kiya gaya ki bataa dijie kitna he
 After this disclosure, the Finance Minister of India has said that the global campaign against benami properties will come into force by 2017, after that it will be very difficult for anyone to keep their assets hidden
 jin logon ne pichley saal khulaasa karne ke liye di gai raham kii samay seemaa ke baad bhi sampattiyon ko chipaaya he unki kair nahin he
 Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi has also ordered an inquiry against 500 Indians whose name has appeared in the Panama Papers
 sarkaar ne kaha he ki antarrashtriya patrakaron ke samooh ke is khulaase kaa swaagat bhi kiya he
 The Express newspaper has also named Aishwarya Rai in a context but her team has described it as baseless
 or bhi kai naam hai, amitabh bachchan se lekar adani ke bade bhai, harish salve, india bulls ke samir gahalot, ikbaal mirchi
 Some of them, while giving their clarification, have described these things as baseless
 kuch kii safai aati hi hogi
 The ICIJ is a group of investigative journalists from 109 institutions around the world in 76 countries
 1997 main ICIJ kii sthapana hui thi taaki is global daur main patrakarita kisi mulk kii seemaa ke bheetar simat kar na rah jaae
 Crime, corruption are no longer confined to the border of one country, as is the case of many countries, so it is important that journalists of many countries work together
 ICIJ main kai prakaar ke anbhavi log kaam karte hai khaskar ve log jo sarkari record ko padhane main daksh hote hai
 There are also fact checkers and lawyers
 patrakarita kahin dam tod rahi he to kahin duniya bhar ke patrkaar patrakarita kaa dam todane waalon kaa tilism tod rahe hai
 The Panama Papers states that the rich also have an underworld
 duniya bhar ke taqatvar log apane mitra, rishtedaar, kisi ajanabi ke naam se farzi company banaate hai, unhen company banane ko kehete hai or apane paise ko idhar se udhar kar lete hai
 Such things keep arising in India, but no one gets caught properly
 germany ke jis patrkaar ne itane bade khulaase kii pahal kii he uske bahaane jaanane main koi buraai nahin ki germany main press kii azaadi kii kya sthiti he
 What is the position of India? repotars bidout borders har saal duniya bhar main press kii azaadi par ek ranking nikaalata he
 In 2015, India ranked 136 out of 180 countries
 yani iske anusaar bharat main press kii swatantraaa bahut hi karaab he
 Germany ranks 12th and Finland ranks first
 bharat kaa sthaan afghanistan se bhi neeche he
 In the era of Hitler, Germany had the Gliesch Schultung system, under which news was asked from one place, certified and printed in all newspapers
 isse german press kii vishwasaneeyata samaapt ho gai thi
 The people there kept reading the false news with confidence for many days and taking advantage of their good news, millions of Jews were put into the gas chamber and roasted
 duusare vishwayuddh ke baad germany main ye halaat badalane lage tabhi ek yaadgaar vakya hua jo german press ke itihaas main mile kaa pathar mana jaataa he
 Spiegel is a major German magazine
 is patrika ne raksha ghotaale kii khabar chhaapi
 The editor was arrested
 puri duniya dekh rahi thi germany apane press kii azaadi ke liye kya karata he
 Thousands of people came out in support of the editor there
 nateeja ye hua ki sampadak ko choda gaya or raksha mantri ko istipha dena padaa
 Since then, Germany has achieved freedom of the press with great effort
 ye udhaaharan aapako isliye diya ki press kii azaadi ko hasil karne main janata kaa bhi utana hi bada role hota he jitna patrkaar or sampadak kaa
 Perhaps this is why Germany's level of press freedom is higher than India
 nepal bhi hamase kai rank aage he
 Anwar from Germany has told that at this time an exhibition is going on in German media in the city of Bonn, Germany, under pressure
 is pradarshnee kaa makasad he ki media kaise dabaav main kaam karata he
 Where there will be freedom of the press, there can also be an exhibition of criticism of the press
 panama papers, vikiliks kii tarah hi he lekin vikiliks se bahut bada he
 wikileaks consisted of only five newspapers, but hundreds of journalists were engaged for over a year to scrutinize the Panama Papers
 kya ye kahani apane aap main kisi bade sahitya yaa film se kam romaanchak he
 By the way, Fonseca, a partner of the league company that is being talked about, is also a famous writer in Panama
 uttari or dakshini america ke bich main padataa he panama shahar
 It has been revealed from this Panama Papers that 72 current or previous heads of state of the world have put their money here by making fake company
 syria ke raashtrapati bashar-al-asad, misr ke purv raashtrapati hosni mubarak, libya ke gaddaphi
 Iceland Prime Minister Singamundur Davi Gunlun and his wife have also been named, alleging that both have invested in a tax haven through Panama's LA Company
 hangaamaa hua he rus ke raashtrapati putin ji kaa naam dekhakar
 You know that older people do not in their own name but tell someone else to open a company in their own name and invest money in it
 wo is paise ko kahin or laga detaa he
 Only the name of big people comes, there is a ruckus but it is not proved in the courts
 bahut kam dharaate hai
 2008-13: Putin's friend sets up a $ 2 billion secret hideout by creating a fake company
 sarje roldugin naam kaa yah mitra putin ke liye front kaa kaam karata he
 To keep the money a secret, the Mausak Fonseca Company helped in the paperwork and formation of the company

 This is called tax haven
 hindi main kar-swarg yaa urdu main kar-jananath kahen to sunne main thik nahin lagata he
 The Panama Papers raise the question before the whole world how it becomes so easy for powerful leaders, heads of country and industrialists to avoid tax
 kaise tamaam jaanch agencia is hakeekat se ankhen moond leti he
 Have you ever heard such a big disclosure by all governments together? aksar patrkaar hi apni zindagi daanv par lagaakar kyon karata he
 The name of the Prime Minister of Pakistan and the President of China, Xi Jinping, has come up
 jabaki ye kaha jaataa he ki chinafing bhrashtachar par lagaam kas rahe hai
 Many leaders and military officers have been arrested
 lekin ab unheen par sawaal uth rahe hai
 Therefore, the leader who says that he has ended corruption, need to stop and think

 hitler ke daur main germany main glaish shaltung vyavastha thi, iske tahat khabaron ko ek jagah se puch kar, pramanit karakar saare akhabaaron main chapa jaataa tha
 This had eroded the credibility of the German press
 vahaan ke log bahut dinon tak juthi khabaron ko yakeen ke saath padhate rahe or unki bekhabari kaa laabh uthaakar lakhon yahudiyon ko gas chember main daalkar bhun diya gaya
 This situation started changing in Germany after the Second World War, when a memorable incident occurred which is considered a milestone in the history of the German press
 germany kii ek badi patrika he spigal
 This magazine published the news of the defense scam
 sampadak hi giraftaar kar liya gaya
 The whole world was watching what Germany does for the freedom of its press
 vahaan par hazaron log sampadak ke samarthan main nikal aae
 The result was that the editor was released and the defense minister had to resign
 tab se lekar ab tak germany ne press kii azaadi ko bahut mehnat se hasil kiya he
 This example is given to you because the public has an equally big role in achieving the freedom of the press as the journalist and editor
 shaayad isiilie germany press kii swatantraaa kaa str bharat se kahin zyaada upar he
 Nepal is also several ranks ahead of us
 germany se anwar ne bataaya he ki is vakt germany ke ek shahar bon main german media par pradarshnee chal rahi he jiskaa naam he dabaav main
 The purpose of this exhibition is how the media works under pressure
 jiske yahaan press kii swatantraaa hogi vahiin par press kii aalochana kii pradarshnee bhi lag sakati he

 mumbai hamale se pehle taj main rukii thi english timstive harmison bataate hai ki 2008 main mumbai hamale ke dauraan england kii team bengalooru ke ek hotel main thahari thi
 The players were shocked because they stayed in the same Taj hotel two weeks ago, where the terrorist attack took place
 harmison ne likhaa, main, andrew flint of or kevin petersan ghatana ko dekh rahe the
 BCCI and ECB continued the series dead in front of the famous Taj Palace Hotel
 kamaron main ghuskar goliyon kii barsaat karke aatanki mehmaanon kaa katl kar rahe the
 We felt that the tour would be canceled due to security reasons, but the ECB and BCCI decided to continue the series

 Thanking Sachin for coming to the dressing room like this, his greatness killed 150 people in the 26 / 11 attack
 harmison ne likhaa, chennai test kii haar shaayad iklauti thi, jis par maine zyada gam nahin kiya

 Pakistan's former dictator Pervez Musharraf's face of being pro-terror has once again been exposed
 ek pakistani channel ko die saakshaatkaar main musharraf ne khulkar kaha ki unhen lashkar e taiyaba se mohabbat he or lashkar or jamaat ud daawa bhi unhen chaahate hai
 Pervez Musharraf said that he had met Hafiz Saeed and his role in Kashmir
 musharraf ne aage kaha ki main hameshaa se kashmir main bhartiya sena ko kuchalanaa chahta tha
 Musharraf had told Ganguly 13 years ago, "india-pak will be a war!" In response to a question, Musharraf said, "I am the biggest supporter of Lashkar and i know they like me
" jamaat ud daawa bhi mujhe pasand karata he
 When Musharraf was asked if he also liked Hafiz Saeed, the former Pakistan dictator's answer was 'yes'
 musharraf ne sweekaar kiya ki ve hafiz said se mili hai
 Please tell that there is a lot of uproar in Pakistan at this time
 jamaat ud daawa kaa sargana hafiz said ek baar phir baahar aa gaya he
 The Pakistan government was unable to produce any evidence against him and the court refused to pursue his detention
 is bich dharmik kattarpathiyon ne pakistan sarkaar ke khilaaf jabardast pradarshan kiya he or unhen hataane ke liye sarkaar ke sena kii madad leni padi
 The US also reacted strongly to the release of Hafiz Saeed and asked the Government of Pakistan to arrest him, but it has no effect on Pakistan
 hafiz ko punjab sarkaar ne aatankwaad rodhi kanoon 1997 ke tahat 31 janvari ko said or uske chaar sahyogiyon ko 90 dinon ke liye hiraasat main liya tha
 Saeed was detained along with his companions Abdullah Ubaid, Malik Zafar Iqbal, Abdul Rahman Abid and Qazi Kashif Hussain
 prantiy sarkaar ne lok suraksha kanoon ke tahat unhen hiraasat main liya tha
 Hafiz Gauravat is worth $ 1 million
 It is worth mentioning that America has placed a reward of one crore rupees on Saeed's head
 10 maheene tak najarband rakhe jane ke baad use reeha kar diya gaya
 The Pakistan government has decided not to detain him in any other case, which will affect India's efforts to punish the culprits of the 2008 Mumbai attack
 may 2008 main america vitt vibhaag ne said ko ek vaishvik aatanki ghoshit kiya tha
 On Saturday, the US had demanded Pakistan to arrest Saeed again
 rihaai ke baad hafiz ne dikhaai hekdinjarabandi khatm hone ke baad hafiz said ne ek baar phir apane puraane raag alaape the
 He congratulated everyone on his release
 saath hi kaha ki kashmir aaazaad hokar rahegaa or bharat mere peeche padaa hua he

 It has been 13 months since the Arvind Kejriwal government came to power in Delhi, in which it passed 14 different bills, but the other aspect of the coin is that none of these 14 laws could be made, that is, the case of the Kejriwal government The scorecard is a cipher

 dilli ke dipti siem manish sisodiya ne kaha ki "14 bill aise hai jinako hamane to paas kiya lekin centre ne nahin kiya
 It is a pain that the people of Delhi are still bereft of the benefits that they would get from passing this bill

 Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was known for his brilliant speech in his political career as well as for his excellent speech and brilliant poems
 yahi vajah he ki unke shabdon kaa istemaal na sirf bijepi par vipakshi partiyaan bhi samay samay par karti rahi hai
 At the same time, the Opposition and Opposition in the House are using Vajpayee and his words according to the convenience
 buudhvaar kodhanyavad prastaavke dauraan hangaamaa hone se bifere piem modi ne vipaksh par waar karte hue kaha ki vahiin rah jaaoge jahaan ho, kyonki vaajapeyi ne kaha tha ki chote man se koi bada nahin hota, toote man se koi khadaa nahin hota
 On Monday, Naresh Aggarwal also advised the government to learn from Vajpayee what he had given advice
 naresh agarwal ne bhi vaajapeyi ke inhen shabdon kaa istemaal kiya tha ki ''bijepi ko atal, adwani ne jinda kiya, kam se kam unke kahe shabdon ko hi yaad kar lijie, bahut bhala hoga
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee had said, no one is bigger than a small mind and no one stands by a broken heart
 naresh agarwal ke bhaashan ko bhi sadan main saraahaa gaya tha
 In his speech, Naresh Aggarwal said that at the center, there will always be no government in this country
 apana dil bada kariye, sabko saath lekar chaliye
 Everyone has to go
 is desh main naresh formula bhi chalata tha
 We had formed a government of welfare, which was not being formed
 vahiin piem narendra modi ne buudhvaar ko gusse ke lahaze main vipaksh par karaara waar kiya
 He also said many poetry during this time
 raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne buudhvaar kosansadamein bayaan diya

 piem modi ke khadey hone par bhi shor kam nahin hua or vipakshi saansadon ne sadan main jamkar narebaaji kii
 During PM Modi's statement, TDP mps of bjp's ally in the House also shouted slogans
 is daurandrama band karo, jhuthe vaade band karo or dhamkaana band karo jaisi narebaaji karte rahe
 Even the slogans like stop jumlebaazi kept echoing
 saath hi jhootha bhaashan band karo or match phixing band karo jaise naare bhi sunai dete rahe
 PM Modi said that on the discussion that has taken place after the address, there have been talks from both sides
 modi ne kaha ki sadan main sarthak charchaa hui he, lekin sirf virodh ke khatir hi virodh karnaa kitna uchit he ye dekhnaa hoga
 He said that the President does not belong to any party or party
 hamaare desh main rajyon kii rachana atal bihari vaajapeyi ne bhi kii thi, unhone teen rajyon kii rachana kii thi lekin koi hangaamaa nahin hua tha
 There was no problem with any state
 piem modi bole ki jab aapane (congress) bharat kaa vibhaajan kiya or desh ke tukade kiye or jo jehar boyaa uske kaaran ye hangaamaa ho rahaa he
 PM Modi reiterated the talk of Atal Bihari Vajpayee during this period
 unhone kaha ki chote man se koi bada nahin hota, toote man se koi khadaa nahin hota
 He said that the dreams of the 21st century were seen in the 80s, but that government could not even bring an aviation policy in this country
 aaj hamaari sarkaar desh ke chote shaharon ko hawaimarg se jod rahi he
 Today there are about 450 operational ships in the country, this year we have placed orders to purchase more than 900 airplanes
 bhale hi unhone raajnneetik kariyar ke dauraan rhite wing bijepi kaa daaman thama hua tha, lekin aaj jis tarah se bijepi vallabh bhai patel jaise purv diggaj congress netaaon ko apane phaayde ke liye istemaal kar rahi he
 At the same time, the opposition party is also not behind in this matter and even though it may not have hijacked the works of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, but has definitely started adopting his words
 samaajawaadee ke naresh agarwal kaa bayaan to udhaaharan bhar he, lekin bijepi se sikhte hue congress or anya vipakshi partiyaan purv piem atal bihari vaajapeyi or diggaj netaa laalkrishna adwani dwaara kahe shabdon kaa istemaal apane phaayde ke liye karne kii shuruyaat kar di he

 The plant is operated by Vedanta Ltd, a unit of Vedanta Ltd, listed in London
 is copper plant ko 27 march ko 15 dinon tak mentanence ke liye band kar diya gaya tha
 Actually, Vedanta wants to increase the capacity of this plant to produce about 8 lakh tonnes of copper cathode from it
 polution control board27 march ko plant se utpaadan band hone ke baad tamilnadu polution control board ne april se plant ko dobaaraa shuru karne ke license ko yah kehete hue radd kar diya ki vedanta ne paryaavaran bachaav ke kshetreey kanoon kaa ulanghan kiya he
 However, this decision of the Pollution Board has been challenged by Sterlite

 Significantly, the board has accused the Sterlite Company that Sterlite dumped copper slag from the plant into the river and did not issue a report on the impact on ground water
 yah pehla mauka nahin he jab is copper plant ko band kiya gaya he
 Earlier in 2013, the plant was closed for several weeks when the National Green Tribunal was facing a case of environmental damage against it

 p Ramnath, CEO of Vedanta's Cleansterlight Copper, has claimed that the plant has complied with all the conditions imposed by the Environment Institute of Neeri and the Supreme Court
 iske saath hi ramnath ne kaha ki ab unki company international finance corporation dwaara tay kiye gaye benchmark ko puraa karne ja rahi he
 The company has claimed that their plant is not causing any harm to the environment
 sterlite ke siio ne kaha ki vah apane plant ko jaanch agenciyon ke liye kholane ko taiyaar he jisase uske khilaaf pradooshan kii udayi gai afvaahen puri tarah se niraadhaar sabit ho sake
 However, the protesters have rejected the company's proposal saying that the problem is not inside the copper plant but the damage to the water source and the environment from the plant
 plant ko band karne kaa ye kar rahe virodhtutikorin ke chidambranar port trust par karmchaariyon kii tutikorin stewdorce association ne tamilnadu ke mukhyamantri se guhaar lagaai he ki jald se jald plant par copper utpaadan ko shuru kiya jaae
 This association claims that thousands of laborers working at the port have become unemployed due to the closure of the plant
 association ke mutabik is port par apana maal bhejne vaali companiyon main vedanta copper plant sabase ahm he
 Along with this, the association claims that many small copper-related factories will be affected in the event of closure of Vedanta plant
 unke thap padane se factriyon main kaam kar rahe logon ke saamne rojgaar kaa sawaal khadaa ho jayega
 Copper prices are increasing in the metal market after the closure of the plant

 With this production capacity, the company holds about 35% of its business in the copper market
 iske alaava is company se hi khadi deshon samet kai asian desho main copper kaa niryaat kiya jaataa he
 At the same time, consumption of copper in the country has been increasing continuously for the last few years

 ) Daripalli Ramiya, who lives in Reddipalli village in Telangana's Khammam district, is known as the 'tree man' of India
 lekin inkaa tree main naam aise hi nahin padaa he balki iske peeche inaki saalon kii mehnat chhipi he
 Ramaiya, 80, is so fond of trees and greenery that she has devoted her entire life to preserving trees
 apana puraa jivan paudhe lagane main samarpit karne vaale ramaiya 1 karod paudhe laga chuke hai
 Seeing this plantation madness, people used to call them 'mad', but when the threat of global warming came up today, people also appreciated their work
 sari par likhe ramayana ke saat khand, british uniwarsity ne kiya sammanitjaane kab se shuru hua paudhe lagane kaa silsilarmaiya ke paudhe lagane ke junun se unka man kaaphi vichlit rahane laga
 Ramaiya then started a new campaign
 ve dharti ko haraa bharaa bananaa chaahate the, isliye apni jeb main beej or cycle par paudhe rakhkar jile kaa lanbaa safar tay karte hai or jahaan kahi bhi khaali jameen dikhti hai vahaan paudhe laga dete hai
 Please tell them that ACADEMY OF UNIVERSAL GLOBAL PEACE has given him a doctorate degree
 shuruyaat main unhone aisa karke apane gaanv ke purv or pashchim disha main chaar-chaar kilometre ke kshetra main bahut se ped- paudhe lagaae lekin vah itane se kahaan rukne vaale the
 He kept planting trees one after the other
 baccha samaj kar karte hai pedo kii rakhwalirmaiya ped-paudhon ko apana baccha samaj kar rakhwali karte hai
 They have not limited their responsibility to plant trees only, but they also look after trees and plants themselves
 agar koi ped suukh jaataa he to inhen kaaphi takalif bhi hoti he
 They really think of these trees as their child
 isliye ye ped sukh jane par bhi uski khub dekhbhaal karte hai or nae ped lagane ke silsile ko bhi thamane nahin dete
 The Vice Chancellor of Jamia received the Life Time Achievement Award Padmashree Awardramaiya devoted his entire life to planting and caring for the saplings
 unke ke prati unke junun ko dekhte hue centre sarkaar ne padmashri award se sammanit kiye ja chuke hai
 This man built an aircraft on the roof of the house, his love for the permission to fly the mill is such that if a tree planted by him dries up, he feels as if he has lost his life
 isliye ve jo bhi paudha lagaate hai use bachche kii tarah paalate hai
 You will be surprised to know that Ramaiya had sold his three acres of land so that he could buy seeds and plants from those money
 mangalvaar shaam nai dilli stesan se 3 bachche baraamad kiye gaye
 The great thing is that all three were found via micro-blogging site Twitter
 mana ja rahaa he ki unke pita ne hi unhen yahaan chhod diya tha
 The good thing is that after a campaign on Twitter, the three children reached their mother
 mangalvaar shaam trend ho rahe ek twit par achaanak dilli police kii najar gai
 a common man tweeted that three children under the age of 10 are together in a frightened New Delhi railway station platform number 16, please help them
 is pehle twit ke kareeb aadhe ghante baad jab police vahaan pahunchi to, bachche vahaan nahin the
 The reward was that the police traced him to platform number one
 saat saal kii rumana, 5 saal kaa raja or 4 varshiya sanaaya buree tarah se ro rahe the
 The three children were very scared and could not tell the police anything
 police ne unhen bharosa dilaayaa or khaane ke liye kuch diya to unhone police ko puri kahani bataai
 He told that his father suddenly appeared in the evening and he took him to the railway station 3 km away
 police kaa kahana he, lagata he bacchon ke pita ne unase kaha hoga ki jab tak unki maa unhen dhund naa le ve yaheen rahen
 When the children told the police their address, the police took them to their house in Nabi Karim
 lekin ghar par maa tabassum so rahi thi
 The police was surprised by this
 maa ne police ko bataaya ki kaam se lautne ke baad usne idhar-udhar dekha bachche nahin mili to so gai
 37-year-old Tabassum is separated from her husband
 unhone bataaya ki jab vah kaam se lautati hai to aksar bachche ghar par nahin hote hai, isliye roj kii baat samajhakar vah so gai
 She told that her husband, a resident of Kanpur, often takes the children and then leaves
 donon ke 7 main se 4 bachche tabassum or 3 bachche unke pati ke saath rahete hai
 It is believed that Tabassum's husband may have left the children at the railway station as a punishment for leaving her

 aavedan ke mutabik, ‘12 janvari ke aadesh ko par phir se punarvichaar karne kii maang kii jaati he kyonki is baat kii paryaapt sambhaavna he ki faisla sunaane vaale (sevanivrutt) nyaayamurti chatarji kaa ravaiya pakshpatpurna rahaa or is tarah maamle main sunwaayee ke liye swat: hi ayogy ho jate hai
 In the application, Justice Alam has been told that if he was aware of the fact that Justice Chatterjee was ineligible, he should have withdrawn from the case himself
 ’ shah ke aavedan main uthaaye gayi kuch bindu varisht ipies adhikari gita johari dwaara daakhil upachaaratmak yachika main bhi uthaaye ja chuke hai jinhone aarope lagaaya tha ki sibiai maamle main ek vishesh raajnneetik tareeke se aage bad rahi thi
 Like Johri, former minister Shah also alleged that the CBI is pressurizing the witnesses to testify in a specific way
 unhone bhi johari kii tarah sibiai ke vishesh nideshak balvinder singh ko jaanch se hataane kii maang kii
 Shah has also demanded the removal of IPS officer Kandaswamy, who was in-charge of the investigation, raising questions over not investigating the role of Andhra Pradesh police in the alleged kidnapping case
 unhone kaha ki sibiai jaanch kaa sabase chaukaaney vaala pahalu yah he ki balvinder singh jinhen ki andhra pradesh police kii bhoomika ko lekar soharabuddi muthbhed maamle main jaanchakartaaon ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dena chahie tha vah khud hi jaanch par najar rakh rahe hai or gita johari jo ki gujarat siaidi kii pramukh hone ke naate maamle main jaanch kar raheen thim or balvinder se poochtacha karnaa chaahati thim vah ab sawaalon kaa saamana kar raheen hai
 Shah, 46, has questioned why the Supreme Court on January 12 insisted that the CBI alone should investigate in the Sohrabuddin case when the court involved the CBI in the riots cases that erupted after the Godhra incident
 Refused and instead preferred to set up a special investigation unit
 purv grih mantri ne kaha ki desh main muthbhed ke 700 maamle hai lekin sheersh nyaayalay ne keval soharabuddin shaikh maamle ko liya
 Shah alleged, "the Congress Party and the central government headed by it have now failed to tarnish the image of the Gujarat government and its chief minister in the cases of the Gujarat riots, now seven hundred across India between 2002 and 2007 due to this malicious intent
" The Sohrabuddin case has been chosen out of over encounter cases
 ’ jethmalani ne 12 agast ko sheersh nyaayalay ke aadesh par sawaal uthaate hue kaha tha ki yah ek nyaayadhish kii peeth ne diya jo khud hi aapraadhik maamle main agency kii jaanch ke ghere main hai
 However, his request for a one-day stay in the case for filing an application on behalf of Shah was not considered
 nyaayamurti alam ne bhi unki daleel par aapatti jataayi
 The bench did not accept Jethmalani's plea that the CBI should not be given any more time to investigate the case
 sibiai ne na keval shah se balki kai varisht police adhikariyon se sawaal jawaab kiye hai
 Besides Shah, IPS officers of Gujarat cadre DG Vanzara and Rajkumar Pandian and Rajasthan cadre police officer Dinesh MN are also accused in the case

 There is an agrarian crisis in the country and there is no good news coming from the monsoon front either
 haalanki may ke maheene se hi monsoon kii ulti ginati shuru ho jaati he lekin desh main mausam kaa purvanumaan lagane vaali company skymet ke taaja aankadon ke lihaaj se monsoon ke aane main deree ho sakati he
 According to Skymet, it will take a little longer than the scheduled date for the monsoon to reach the Kerala coast this year
 amuman monsoon kerala tat par 1 june ko aata he par is baar skymet kaa purvanumaan he ki vah 4 june ko aayega
 In contrast, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) is describing the monsoon as late
 iemdi ke mutabik, kerala tat par monsoon pahunchane kii taarikh 6 june he
 It may take 4 days of agitation
 skymet main vaais president mahesh palavat ke mutabik, "monsoon main thodi der hone kii fori vajah he ki purvi-madhya arab sagar main ek prati-chakravaat ban rahaa he
 But the real cause of the arrival of monsoon and a slight decrease in rain is the effect of El Nino
 chakravaat yaa prati-chakravaat jaise system teen chaar din main khatm ho jate hai
 The delay caused by that does not matter much
 par monsoon par padane vaala asli asar to al nino kaa he
 "over the years, the accuracy of the prediction of the monsoon forecast, especially its arrival on the Kerala coast, is questioned, but M
 Mohapatra, scientist at IMD, says," Except 2015, for the last 14 years (2005-2018) we Accurately predicted the arrival of monsoon
 monsoon ke aagaman kii bhavishyavaanee ke liye 2005 se hi ek swadeshi sankhyikeey model kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, jo sateek he
 "significantly, in 2015, IMD gave the date of arrival of the monsoon on the Kerala coast to May 30, when the monsoon actually came on June 5
 iemdi ne 2014 main 5 june, 2016 main 7 june, 2017 main 30 may or 2018 main 29 may ko monsoon ke aagaaj kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi or uske aane kii taarikh bhi 2014 main 6 june or 2016 main 8 june thi
 Monsoon came on the stated dates in 2017 and 2018
 to kya isse desh main barish kam ho sakati he?iskaa jawaab haa bhi he or nahin bhi
 There are fears that the monsoon may be below normal this time
 palavat kehete hai, "monsoon main der hone kaa arth barish kii maatra main kami nahin he
 But this time the rainfall will be less than normal
 hamaari bhavishyavaanee saamaanya ke 93 fisadi tak barsaat kii thi or ham us par kaayam hai
 "mahapatra also says," There is no relation between the amount of monsoon and the amount of rain
 "mahapatra kehete hai, "barish kam hogi yaa nahin, is bare main abhi kahana uchit nahin he
 In the first week of June, we will be able to tell something concrete by releasing the forecast for the second round
 " gauratlab he ki mausam vibhaag ne monsoon ke saamaanya se 96 fisadi barsaat hone kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi jo saamaanya maani jaati he
 In the language of meteorology, monsoon is considered normal and 90 to 96 percent of the rain is less than normal in the rainfall ranging from 96 to 104 percent
 scymet or mausam vibhaag donon kaa maananaa he ki prashanth mahaasaagar main al nino kaa asar bharat main barsaat par hoga
 According to Skymet, the probability of a monsoon being below normal (93%) is up to 55 percent
 agency ke mutabik, desh main sookhaa padane kii 15 fisadi ashanka he
 Palawat says, "one of the reasons is El Nino
 agar vaishvik mausam par al nino prabhavakaari hota he to aasaan shabdon main bharat main isaki vajah se kam barish hoti he or agar laa nina prabhaav ho to barsaat acchhee hoti he
 "basically, El Niño is a warm oceanic current that rises along the Argentine coast in the eastern Pacific
 jab yah asardaar hoti he to purvi prashanth mahaasaagar main sataha kaa taapmaana bad jaataa he or hind mahaasaagar, bengal kii khadi or arab sagar main, yani dakshin-purvi asia main samudr kaa tapaman kam ho jaataa he
 So clouds become less with this
 jaahir he barsaat kii maatra or tivrata kam hogi
 Palawat clarifies, "el Nino's impact will last from June to mid-july
 par uske baad monsoon apni rangath main aayega
 "the impact on the Kharif crop, although the Meteorological Department is still maintaining the normal monsoon
 par krishi sankat se jujh rahe desh main monsoon kii maatra main kami bura asar chhod sakati he
 Last year, the Meteorological Department had predicted 87 percent of the normal rainfall (normal) but the actual rainfall was only 91 percent of the normal
 natijatan, pichley saal kharif kii buaai main kami ai thi
 The agriculture ministry reported last June that it had reduced kharif sowing by 20 per cent compared to the previous year

 ' gajiabad main police or badmaashon ke bich hue ek encounter main uttar pradesh police ko badi kamyaabi haath lagi he
 a prize crook is injured in this encounter
 is badmaash par upi ke do jilon main kareeb 45000 rupaye kaa inaam ghoshit tha
 It is being told that after the encounter, the crook who came under the control of Ghaziabad police is the resident of Badayun, whose name is Phool Mian aka Rizwan alias Anees
 us par kareeb 27 se zyada mukaddame darj hai
 Last night the crook Rizwan alias Anees came to the Mahamaya Stadium in Ghaziabad with his teammates to carry out a major crime
 police ne use roka to usne firing shuru kar di
 After this, an encounter between the police and the miscreants started
 police dwaara kii gai javaabi karrwai main badmaash ghayal ho gaya, jise aspataal main bhartee karavaaya gaya
 After this, after getting treatment, he is being sent to jail
 police ke mutabik rigwan par do darjan se zyada lut, hatya dakaiti jaise sangeen aapraadhik mukademen darj hai
 a reward of 2 xxrep 4 0 thousand rupees has been declared on him from Badaun and 25000 thousand rupees on him in Sambhal district
 rigwan par badaayun, sambhal, muradabad, bijanour or dilli main kai aapraadhik mukaddame darj hai or vah lambey samay se faraar chal rahaa tha
 This miscreant used to commit criminal incidents by forming a gang and was currently living in Imphal with his family
 ise haal hi dilli police ne ek warrant jari hone ke baad giraftaar kiya tha lekin shaatir badmaash ne vakil ke jariye herpher kar us maamle main jamaanat le lee
 On the siege of the police last night, the miscreant opened fire on the police team and was shot in his leg in the police's forced action
 ab police yah pataa lagane main juty he ki ab tak usne ensiaar main kitni vaardaaton ko anjaam diya he or uskaa puraa aparaadhik itihaas kya he? There has been a natural disaster in Uttarakhand
 hajaaron ke marane kii ashanka he
 The relief work is delayed and people are accusing the state government of negligence
 in sabake bich hamaare sahyogi channel hedlins today ke managing editorrahul kanvalane baat kii uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri vijay bahuguna se
 During this, Bahuguna repeatedly called construction necessary for the development of the state and did not forget to thank the party high command for cooperation
 dekhen kya hai sawaalon ke ghere main khadey siem ke javabaisawalampure desh kii nigahen uttarakhand par hai
 In the wake of this terrible tragedy
 kya halaat hai is samay yahaan?javaabalye himalayan sunami he
 Three quarters of the state has been badly affected by this
 hamaare yahaan transport yaa to bai road he yaa bai air
 But there are not much aerodromes
 zyaadaatar log sadak se hi aate jate hai
 500 roads became useless due to this disaster
 200 se zyada pul tut gaye
 There was a wrath of nature in Kedarnath
 badal fata or jhil kaa pani bhi ghati main umad aayaa
 Everything was destroyed up to Gaurinath in a stretch of 20 km ahead of Kedarnath
 bahut log mare hai
 Their exact figure cannot be given right now, because everything is buried in debris
 agar sena vahaan paidal pahunchati he or feedback detii he, tabhi sahi sahi sankhya bataai ja sakati he
 Question: It is a matter of the dead, but why there is a delay in saving those who are alive
 javabasehamen pataa he ki kai jagah log bache hai, fanse hai
 But it has to be understood that these are places where helicopters cannot go
 kabhi helleypad na hone kii vajah se, to kabhi kharaab mausam ke chalate
 Here rescue work is going on under the supervision of army generals
 hamaara sabakaa pehla mishan hi he jivit logon ko bachaana
 Most of such people are in the valley of Kedar Nath
 gaurikund main bhi aise hi halaat hai
 There are also 17-18 thousand people stranded there
 badrinaath or gagariyaa kaa bhi yahi haal he
 The state government has also hired 12 helicopters for rescue
 magar yah samajhnaa hoga ki ek baar main ek air aria main ek nishchit sankhya main hi helicopter ud sakate hai
 i would like to congratulate the Air Force and Civilian officers that they are landing helicopters even after all the difficulties
 bahut chote or mushkil hisson main land kar rahe hai
 But this is a big problem
 puure desh ke log yahaan hai
 are worried
 ham puri koshish kar rahe hai
 We just say that those who are in safe places
 ve pareshaan na hon
 We will do everything to save them
 sawalksarkaar kah rahi he ki kuch sau mare
 Opponents are saying that the death toll is in the thousands
 
 
 javabandekhie, jab tak ground se feedback nahin aata, main clear aankada nahin de saktaa
 My concern is to save the stranded people
 unheen khaanaa pahunchane kii he
 This is a very big exercise
 sab kuch sena kii madad se ho rahaa he
 The entire state government is involved in this
 jahaan road block he
 There we are creating alternate routes
 trephic diawart kiya ja rahaa he
 It will take some time
 central government hamaari madad kar rahi he
 Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi have shown kindness in helping
 sabakaa saajha prayaas chal rahaa he, taaki fanse hue logon ko bachaaya ja sake
 Question: We talked to many people
 log pareshaan hai
 Shocked
 unhen lag rahaa he ki madad der se aa rahi he
 There is no food and water
 rajya sarkaar kuch nahin kar rahi
 
 
 Answer: i praise people's concerns
 yahaan mushkil he
 This is a hilly area, not a plain
 isliye dikkat aa rahi he
 Roads are not left
 sirf hawaii raste se hi ham khaanaa pani de sakate hai
 There is also a limit to fly the chopper
 kuch der to lagegi hi
 i am appealing to the local people to come forward and help the stranded tourist
 hamane har guest house par free loging or fooding kii vyavastha kii he
 Transport is free
 bai road yaa bai train ham logon ko waapas bhej rahe hai
 We have no problem of money or resources
 dikkat ye he ki ise pahunchaaen kaise
 How to deliver army kii madad se ham yahi kar rahe hai
 Question: It is also being said that people are the cause of this disaster
 nadi ke kinaaron par lagaataar nirmaan ho rahaa he
 In such a situation, when it rains, the river does not increase its span and destruction starts
 javaabalye bhi chizon ko dekhne kaa ek tarika he
 But the practical thing is that if Dehradun received 330 mm of rain in a day, then how is this man made
 kedarnath main badal fata, to ye manmed kaise hai
 Uttarkashi and Rudraprayag along the rivers have been inhabited for centuries
 yahaan masalaa river bed kaa he
 Mining is banned due to court orders
 aise main boulder aakar nadi main lagaataar gir rahe hai
 The second material is coming in it
 ham inhen uthaa nahin sakate
 Due to this, the river floor is coming up slowly
 pani isi ke chalate tat todakar baahar bah rahaa he
 i believe that there should be no construction on the river banks
 main paryaavaran virdohi nahin hum
 But also understand that this state has 70 percent forests
 unhen ched nahin sakate
 Only water left
 agar inkaa istemaal hydro power paidaa karne main nahin karenge
 So how will it work
 or ye jo project chal rahe hai
 They have received permission from the central government ministries
 hamen paryaavaran ke saath saath yahaan ke logon kaa vikaas bhi dekhnaa he
 Otherwise people will get angry even in that situation
 hamaari arthvyavastha tourism or hydro power par nirbhar he
 There will be construction for tourism, only then will investment come
 in sabake bich paryaavaran kaa bhi khyaal rakhaa jayega
 Question: How long will it be possible to have a normal state in the state? Answer: We will look at the Kedarnath temple with archaeological survey
 unhen anumaan lagaana he ki kitna nirmaan karwaanaa hoga
 The state government will bear whatever costs are incurred in it
 meraa anumaan he ki ham do hafte main sabhi bache hue logon ko surakshit waapas nikaal lenge
 In addition to the road network, helicopters will be used
 baaki dekhnaa hoga ki gaanvon ko, pani kii line ko, bijli ke strecchar ko
 How much damage has been done to the roads
 iske bare main thik thaak kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa, par itnaa tay he ki bahut time lagegaa

 The way this deal was done, it seems that this is a last-time surrender made during negotiations
 pentagon main maujuud kai logon kaa maananaa he ki aapane joint staff ke chairman ko bich manjhdhaar main chhod diya, kya aap is par coment kar sakate hai?' In response, Obama said, 'major, i must congratulate you for the cleverness you ask

 This would increase our difficulties
 iran philhal ye samajhataa he ki ye newclear deal puri tarah se newclear ke mudde par tikaa he kisi or par nahin
 Comments obama ke anusaar, 'agar ham newclear deal se zaraa bhi bhatakate to hamaare liye in nagarikon ko vahaan se nikaalnaa or mushkil ho jaataa

 ' Carrying his question further, Garrat asked, "only last week the chairman of the Joint Chiefs staff said that Iran should not get any exemption in the case of conventional weapons or ballistic missiles
" jis tarah se ye deal hui usase aisa lagata he ki ye baatcheet ke dauraan kiya gaya antim samay kaa aatmasamarpan he
 Many people in the Pentagon believe that you left the chairman of the joint staff in the middle, can you comment on this? ' iske jawaab main obama ne kaha, 'major aap jis chaalaaki se sawaal karte hai uske liye mujhe aapako badhai deni chahie
 i have met the families of those four people incarcerated in Iran and no one is happy with this situation
 hamaare rajanyik or duusari timen is dauraan lagaataar un logon ko vahaan se baahar nikaalane ke liye kaam kar raheen hai
 ' obama ne aage kaha, 'ab sawaal ye he ki akhir hamane is newclear samjhaute ke dauraan unki rihaai kii shart kyon nahin rakhi to iske peeche kii logic ko samajhen
 If we had done this, Iran would have felt that it could get more exemption in return for the release of these citizens from us
 isse hamaari mushkilen or bad jaati
 Iran currently understands that this nuclear deal rests entirely on the nuclear issue and not on anyone else

 Modi did not start the new India movement
 nae bharat ke andolan ko kejariwal or anna ne milakar apane jigar se foonka tha
 Anna's fast unto death was the most influential fast in the history of the country after 1947
 aisa anshan jisaki live kawarej ne karodon gharon ko pehali baar ek badi ladaai ke liye ek jute kar diya
 This was the same point where both the BJP and the Congress were afraid and hid in the trenches of Parliament and Modi was not in the scene
 isi mode par kejariwal apane saath anna or kiran bedi ko lekar agar aage bad jate to shaayad 2014 main hindustan kii siyasat main unka mayaar kuch or hota
 At the time of the agitation for the August Revolution, the craziness of Kejriwal and Anna was that Hindustan was being spread on one of their defiance
 unke munh se bol nahi mantra nikal rahe the
 At his behest, events were changing
 unki ungaliyon par rajpath naach rahaa tha
 All this show was by Kejriwal
 ye sara andolan kejariwal ke blue-print se niklaa tha
 Anna became the face of the movement and Kiran Bedi her credibility
 lekin mahatvakankshaon kaa jowar desh ke sabase aitihaasik jan andolan ko nigal gaya
 Some's ego became suicidal for some's stubborn movement
 raaton raat mili shoharat main kiran bedi or kejariwal donon dagamagaa gaye or anna ko umadti bheed baha le gai
 Probably all of them had jumped high in status and lost balance in the air
 is andolan kii raakh se ek vyakti kaa punarjanm hua
 That person was Narendra Damodar Das Modi who did not delay in filling the void of scattered government, scattered opposition and a scattered movement in Delhi
 jaise koi sher ghaat lagaakar maukey kaa intjaar kar rahaa ho
 In the same way, Modi played the biggest bet in life as soon as he got a chance
 kejariwal apane mul saathiyon se juda hokar ek jiti baaji haar chuke the or modi unheen ke andolan kii raakh main buji chingaarion ko jalaakar aage nikal gaye
 The biggest challenge is to handle oneself in the midst of success
 satta main bachche kii tarah chand maangane kii jid nahin kii jaati
 There is talk of winning the moon and Mars
 satta main bachche kii tarah kursi ko thokar nahi maari jaati
 Iqbal of the chair is maintained
 2002 main ek pashchaatap modi ne kiya tha
 Now in 2014, Kejriwal will have to do a repentance
 modi ke liye mulaayam, mayawati yaa pavaar jaise daagdar chunauti nahin hai
 Kejriwal is the real challenge for Modi
 sach yahi he ki desh ko chalaane ke liye modi jaruri he
 Kejriwal to check Modi

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special news letters Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has met Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa amidst criticism from across the world and India's warning about the hanging of Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav
 ek aadhikarik sutara ne bataaya ki jadhav ke maamle main pradhanmantri navaj sharif ko bharose main lene ke liye sena pramukh ne unhen mulaakaat ke liye bulaayaa tha
 According to the report of Pakistani media, in this meeting, both of them said not to bow down to any pressure
 pakistan main sainya field general court marshall kii ore se aatankwaad or jasusi ke maamle main kathith sanliptata ko lekar sena adhinium ke tahat 46 ke jadhav ko maut kii sajaa sunai gai he
 The death penalty was confirmed by Pakistani Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa
 bharat nejadhav ko maut kii sajaadie jane ke pakistani sena ke is kadam ko galat bataaya tha
 The Ministry of External Affairs called it a "planned murder"
 videshmantri sushamaa swaraj ne islamabad ko saaf-saaf chetavanee di thi ki agar jadhav kii sajaa par amal hua to nai dilli ke saath uske rishton par sidhaa asar padegaa
 Sushma had said to go to any extent to save Jadhav
 pakistan kaa aarope he ki jadhav 3 march, 2016 ko baluchistan se giraftaar kiya gaya, jahaan ve ro ke liye kaam kar rahe the
 However, India says that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran
 asaram pichley kareeb paune do saal se jail ke andar he
 In the accusations of sexual abuse
 baap ke peeche-peeche baad main bete narayan sai ko bhi isi tarah ke iljaam main jail le jaaya gaya
 Since the death of these two, a total of seven witnesses have been killed so far
 inamen se do kaa to katl hi kar diya gaya
 Now the latest attack is on Narayan Sai's former PA, who was attacked by two attackers after entering his house in Panipat
 in sabhi ke sabhi kirdaaron ke saath teen baaten behad ajeeb hai
 The first is that they have been close to the so-called saint Asaram or his son Narayan Sai, surrounded by all the rapes and accusations of hypocrisy
 doosraa ye ki in sabhi ne asaram or unke bete narayan sai ke khilaaf sach bolne kii himmat jutai or bataur gavaah saamne aae
 The third is that two of these eight were killed by anonymous murderers, while the remaining six survived a fatal attack on themselves
 lekin kya in tamaam kirdaaron kii ye kaaman baaten mahaz ek ittefaq hai? yaa phir iske peeche vahi sach chipa he, jiske charche aam hai or jis pahalu ko dhyaan main rakh kar khud police bhi in hamalon or katl ke maamalon kii tafteesh kar rahi he
 That is the aspect, when speaking against Asaram Bapu or his son Narayan Sai, all of them are either being removed or trying to be removed one by one
 sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki agar aisa nahin he, to baap-bete ke jail jate hi unke khilaaf munh kholanewaale itane saare logon par hamale kyon or kaise ho rahe hai?isi kadi main ai he sabase taaja hamalaa
 This attack with bullets is not on anyone else but Mahendra Chawla, former PA of Narayan Sai himself
 lekin isse pehle ki asaram or narayan sai ke khilaaf gavaahi denevaalon par ai musiibat or is kufnaak sajeesh ke bare main baat karen, aaie pehle asaram kii taaja vaani sun lijie
 Asaram, who has been lodged in Jodhpur jail for the last two years, complains that when Salman Khan can get bail, then why not a saint like him? Mahendra Chawla is one of the few who has been surrounded by accusations of all the father-son ie Asaram and Narayan dared to open their mouths against Sai
 ab chunki jokhim bada he, to police ko bhi ahsaas tha ki chawla ko nuksaan pahunchane kii koshish kii ja sakati he
 Hence, the police also deploy security guards along with Chawla
 lekin iske baavjood hamalwaar mahendra chawla ko apni goliyon kaa nishaanaa bana lete hai
 The man named Mahendra Chawla was attacked by two masked attackers and targeted his bullets
 hamalaavaron ne to use goli maarthe vakt ailaania kaha ki asaram baapu or narayan sai ke khilaaf munh kholane yaa gavaahi dene kii bas yahi ek sajaa he
 
 
 Death sentence
 lekin apni khushkismati or bahaduree se mahendra chawla ab bhi naa sirf zindaa he, balki police ko khud par hue hamale kii puri kahani bhi bayaan kar chukaa he
 Naxalites in Chhattisgarh have devised a new recipe to save IED and landmine
 naksali ab IED or barudi surang ke upar jaanwaron kaa maance laga rahe hai
 So that its smell causes the security forces' sniffer dogs to wander
 darasal bastar main rojaanaa police or kendriya suraksha balon ke jawan apane snifer dogs ke jariye IED or barudi surang khoj nikaal rahe hai
 This causes the Naxalites to return water
 yahi nahin iske chalate naksaliyon kaa visphotak saamagree kaa jakhira bhi ghatate ja rahaa he
 However, police and central security forces have also broken this idea of naxalites
 ve sadhe hue kadamon se jangal ke bheetar apane kadam badha rahe hai
 ieds are still coming out as before, but security forces personnel and sniffer dogs have become more alert
 bastar range ke DIG pi sundaraj ke mutabik naksaliyon ke is nuskhe kii tod suraksha balon ne dhund nikaali he
 According to him, with the activeness of the security forces and the vigilant movement, the explosive material present with the Naxalites has decreased significantly
 bastar main jangal ke bheetar naksaliyon ne ab mookbadhir jaanwaron ko bhi maut ke ghat utaarna shuru kar diya he
 Rotten carcasses of wild animals ranging from wild animals to domesticated bodies have often been seen everywhere in many parts of the forest
 aamtaur par iske pehle gramin apane maweshiyon ke shavon ko jameen main dafan kar diya karte the, lekin ab naksali or unke sahyogi soochna milte hi paaltu jaanwaron ke shavon ko apane saath le ja rahe hai
 Then the flesh is removed from the dead body and applied in small ieds
 naksaliyone rambo ero or paaramparik tir ko or ghaatak banane kaa kaam bhi kiya he
 They have now started putting the gunpowder used in firecrackers in the front of the arrow
 ise jala kar choda gaya tir aatishbaajee kii tarah aawaaj karata he
 The police and central security forces personnel are taken aback for some time due to the sound and smoke emanating from the encounter site
 unhen ek saath chode gaye tir se kisi bade visphot kaa abhas hota he
 Earlier, they used explosives for industrial use
 bastar main police aurkendriya suraksha balonke javaanon ne naksaliyon kii badali hui ranneeti or kavayad par apni puri nigaah gada di he
 Now the security forces are more alert and alert than ever
 snifer dogs hi nahin balki javaanon ke kadam behad sadhe hue hai
 a slight lapse can prove fatal
 isliye unhone badali hui ranneeti ke tahat khud ko bhi dhaal liya he

 So, we also came to Guptkashi in the hope that he (my father) must have been killed
 
 
 lekin hamane tay kiya ki ham aage jaaenge, or khud unhen talash karenge
 
 
 My heart says, my father is safe, so i keep moving forward

 saurabh kaa kahana he, "mujhe is baat par katai yakeen nahin ki unhen kuch ho saktaa he, kyonki mujhe lagaataar mahasoos ho rahaa he ki ve bilkul surakshit hai
 
 
 There are many villages here where there is no means of communication, so, maybe, they are stranded somewhere, maybe, injured, or maybe, someone has sheltered them
 
 
 " In spite of such terrible destruction, he is not ready to give up hope, because now he and Richa's parents have also given up, and have said yes to getting them married in front of everyone
 
 
 tippaniyan On the other hand, Manish is not ready to give up in search of his 54-year-old father Kaushal, who was in Kedarnath at the time of the tragedy, because according to him, "we read a news in 'dainik Jagran', which told That a woman found her missing husband 20 days after the accident
 
 
 so, ham bhi isi ummid main guptkashi aae the, jahaan bataaya gaya ki vah (mere pita) shartiya maare gaye honge
 
 
 But we decided that we would go ahead, and find ourselves
 
 
 meraa dil kahata he, mere pita surakshit hai, so, isiilie main aage badhata ja rahaa hum
 
 
 " bachapan main suni himmat na haarane kii kahaniyon ko apane jivan main charitaarth karne vaale in ladakon ne ummiido ke sahare aage badhane ko nae arth de die hai
 
 
 Manish says, "my father is played
 
 
 ab agar main hi tut gaya, to ghar koun dekhegaa
 
 
 i have not lost hope, i will go upstairs, and will keep searching until hope is completely broken
 
 
 " udhar, saurabh ne chehre par muskaan ke saath shairana andaaz main kaha, "ummid par duniya kaayam he
 
 
 We have come with hope, what to do now, we will keep searching
 
 
 " Saurabh is actually searching for 23-year-old Richa Tripathi, her parents and 14 others
 
 
 saurabh ke anusaar, "hamaare bich (saurabh or richa ke bich) aaj se saat saal pehle pyaar hua tha
 
 
 We also got married in the year 2011, but against the wishes of their parents
 
 
 " By the way, the town of Sonprayag, known for the confluence of the Vasuki and Mandakini rivers, has been completely destroyed
 
 
 vahaan dur-dur tak koi insaan dikhaai nahin detaa
 
 
 At the moment, only collapsed houses, shops and guest houses are visible here
 
 
 jahaan bazaar hua karata tha, vahaan sirf lohe ke garder, or ret dikh rahi he
 
 
 Heads of footwear, shoes and other belongings of the unfortunate people are seen on the only road left in a condition of walking
 
 
 maahaul aisa he ki us behad dahala dene vaali prakruthik aapadaa ko aaj bhi aasaani se mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he
 
 
 But 24-year-old software engineer Saurabh Mishra's unbridled love and firm intentions are clearly visible
 
 
 is maahaul main bhi vah lagbhag har jagah poster chipakaata gum rahaa he, jin par richa kii tasviir, kuch phone number or 10,000 rupee ke inaam kii ghoshnaa chhapi hui he
 
 
 Saurabh says, "I am not sure that anything could happen to them, because i constantly feel that they are absolutely safe
" 
 
 yahaan aise bahut-se gaanv hai, jahaan sanchaar kaa koi saadhan nahin he, so, ho saktaa he, ve kahin fanse hue hon, ho saktaa he, ghayal hon, yaa ho saktaa he, unhen kisi ne panaah de di ho
 
 
 " itane bhayankar vinaash ko dekhte hue bhi vah ummid haarane ke liye isliye taiyaar nahin he, kyonki ab to uske or richa ke mata-pita ne bhi haar maan lee he, or sabake saamne unki shaadi karwaane ke liye haa kar di he
 
 
 The comments udhar, manish apane 54-varshiya pita kaushal, jo traasadee ke vakt kedarnath main hi the, kii talash main haar maanane ke liye isliye taiyaar nahin he, kyonki uske mutabik, "hamane 'dainik jaagran' main ek samachar padhaa, jisamen bataaya gaya tha ki ek mahila ko uskaa laapata pati haadase ke 20 din baad mil gaya
 
 
 So, we also came to Guptkashi in the hope that he (my father) must have been killed
