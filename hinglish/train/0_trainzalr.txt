 Destroy 
 
 shahar nahin rote
 
 
 There are concrete buildings, there are big bridges
 
 
 wo kaise ro sakate hai
 
 
 Cities do not cry
 
 
 lekin aaj ye shahar
 
 
 The one who is called Chennai is crying tears of blood
 
 
 sailaab ne ise sisakane ke liye majaboor kar diya he
 
 
 The salt of the tears has dissolved in the rain water
 
 
 aaj ek shahar ghutanon tak keechad or pani main dhansa
 
 
 
 khud ko tinkaa- tinkaa bikharate dekh rahaa he
 
 
 Ok is the city
 
 
 lekin har shahar kaa bhi ek dil he
 
 
 Do not know where people came from in his lap
 
 
 do vakt kii roti milti he
 
 
 You get a living to live your life
 
 
 aaj vahi shahar matam main he
 
 
 The city which was till yesterday
 
 
 dakshin bharat kii shaan tha
 
 
 Which was named in four metros
 
 
 us chennai ne aahista- aahista khud ko ujadte dekha
 
 
 From human beings to animals, there was a disaster
 
 
 kehete hai pani jindagi jeene ke liye sabase jaruri chizon main he
 
 
 There is also a water in Panchatatva
 
 
 lekin aaj usee pani ne
 
 
 Forced Chennai to cry
 
 
 aaj ek shahar nishabd ro rahaa he
 
 
 This is a city mourning
 
 
 ye ek shahar kaa matam he
 
 
 
 plis is matam ko aankadon main mat tauliye
 
 
 Do not calculate the sufferings of its residents
 
 
 kyonki duniya main sabakuch to bana
 
 
 But no such bookkeeping was made
 
 
 jo dukh kaa hisaab laga sake
 
 
 There is an endless influx of misery in Chennai today
 
 
 ek shahar aaj sach main khun ke nahin sailaab ke aansu ro rahaa he
 
 
 This is the sadness of Chennai
 
 
 lekin ankhen puure desh kii nam hai
 
 
 This city was proud
 
 
 
 Its roots in history were very deep
 
 
 bhavishya ko lekar ummiden badi thim
 
 
 But a few daily rains left the city devastated
 
 
 insaani dard ko to ham aap roj samajhate hai
 
 
 But if possible, feel the pain of a city today
 
 
 aapkaa bhi kalejaa fat jayega
 
 
 Your eyes will also get wet
 
 
 aapkaa dard bhi chhalak jayega
 
 
 The flood of Chennai is similar to this
 
 
 khud hi sochie naa jo shahar din- raat chalata rahata tha
 
 
 What to do if that city does not cry at all 
 
 1639 se pehle jab chennai madras nahin tha
 
 
 There used to be a small village then
 
 
 madraspattanam naam se ise janaa jaataa tha
 
 
 Since then, the city has expanded
 
 
 tarakkee kii seedhiyaan chadhataa gaya
 
 
 
 shahar kaa cheharaa badla or naam badal gaya
 
 
 But today the flood has submerged the city in the process of pain
 
 
 is shahar ko itane gam die hai
 
 
 Which will be filled
 
 
 lekin in aansuon ko ye shahar shaayad hi bhul paae
 
 
 The city knows how to live, it will learn to live again
 
 
 lekin ye manjar wo shaayad hi kabhi bhul paae

 madhya pradesh kii is rajdhani main abhi bhale hi ganganchumbi imaaraten najar nahin aati hon, lekin jald hi bhopal main bhi hyrise building najar aane lagengi
 In January 2013, the government has approved to increase the height of highrise buildings from 12 meters to 30 meters
 uplabdh sadakon ke hisaab se building kii oonchai badhaai ja sakegi
 These provisions have been implemented by amending Bhopal's Master Plan 2005
 saikadon yojanaayen inhen praavdhaanon ke kaaran ataki padi thim, jinhen ab manjuuri milane kii ummid he
 The largest building in the city is being built in the Arera Colony area by the name of Leela Sons Builders Kanha Tower
 is imaarat main 15 manzilen hai jinamein teen or chaar room ke 252 flats honge
 For the first time such a tall building is being built in a city like Bhopal
 lila sans bilders apni is imaarat main kai tarah kii suvidhaayen uplabdh kara rahaa he jaise bacchon or bujurgon ko samay bitaane ke liye alag-alag sthaan
 There is a claim about this building that it can also bear the brunt of a strong earthquake
 is bahumanjila imaarat ke saath hi shahar main isi tarah kii or bhi kai yojanaayen paravaan chadhgaye vaali hai
 Earlier the tallest building so far was constructed by the Madhya Pradesh Housing Board as Platinum Plaza, which consists of a 10-storey residential building and a seven-floor commercial building
 rajya sarkaar ne bhoomi vikaas niyam, 2012 ko lagu kar diya he
 But due to Bhopal Master Plan 2005, many rules were not implemented here
 isliye ab sarkaar ko kai praavdhaanon ko master plan main shaamil karnaa padaa he
 According to the new provision, now the builders will have to provide twice as much parking space as before
 iske saath hi sadakon kii chaudaai bhi kam-se-kam 7
 Will have to be 5 meters, which was 6 meters earlier
 bhopal ke real estate group agi8 akruti group bhi shahar ke misarod main akruti neenv ke naam se 35 acre main colony viksit kar rahaa he
 a 15-storey residential complex is also being constructed in this
 company ke chairman hemanth kumaar soni kehete hai, ''bhopal jaise shahar main sarkari niyam ke chalate badi imaaraten abhi tak nahin ban pai hai
 Now buildings up to 18 meters are being allowed in the middle of the city
 lekin floor aria resho (ekher) nahin badhaayaa ja rahaa he
 Which will not benefit the builders and buyers
 ”soni aage kehete hai, ''yadi ekher badhaayaa jaataa he to yah sahi myne main jameen kii samasya ko kaaphi had tak kam kar degaa
 With this, we will be in a position to benefit buyers as well
 ham har tabake ke ghar ke sapane ko saakaar karnaa chaahate hai
 “bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh located in the middle of the country, is generally considered to be a better city for people who want to live after retiring

 But due to non-increase of FAR, the builders and developers are still not happy
 shahar main lagbhag 4,000 makaan bana chuke sheethal samooh ke siemdi manoj pradhan kehete hai, ''imaaraton kii oonchai badhaane se jagah kii samasya khatm nahin hogi
 For this, the government will have to take a decision to increase the FAR
 krishi bhoomi ke vyavsaayik or rahvaasee upyog ko rokane ke liye sarkaar ko ekher badhanaa chahie
 Even if the development of the city is to be done on the lines of other metros, the government will have to decide on the FAR or else it is meaningless to think about vertical development
 ”ekher kisi bhi makaan kii chat kaa kul kshetra or us jameen ke kul kshetra kaa anupaat hota he
 The provision of FAR is made region-wise in the master plan and allows municipal construction on the same basis
 iske mutabik yadi aapke paas 5,000 varg foot kshetra he or ekher 1
 If 25, you can build on an area of 6,250 square feet
 bilders is baat se bhi naakhush hai ki hyrise building banane ke liye sarkaar ne 30 meter tak kii jo had tay kii he vah bhopal jaise shahar main mukhya ilaakon ke liye nahin he
 Only up to 18 meters can be constructed there
 shahar ke empi nagar, new market, arera colony, airport road jaise ilaakon main 18 meter nirmaan kii hi anumati milegi
 The provision of 30 meters is in areas outside which are still developing

 Opposition parties sometimes accused the BJP of benefiting and sometimes put the Election Commission in the dock

 Opposition parties have come under attack after PM Modi and Amit Shah received a clean chit from the Election Commission over the complaint of PM Modi and BJP Chief Amit Shah breaking the code of conduct

 Why are elections for Bengal's 42 seats being held in seven phases? bhaajapa ko phayda pahunchane kaa aropavipakshi partiyon ne chunaav ayog par pakshpaat kaa bhi aarope lagaaya

 Rahul Gandhi said that whatever the Election Commission does, the public has made up their mind, then no one can do anything
 lekin is baat ko andekha nahin kiya ja saktaa ki chunaav ayog apni jimmedaari thik se nahin nibhaa rahaa he

 farhaad suri bole ki vibhinn padon main notebandi ke baad se kam rajasav prapti ke kaaran esadmasi ko lagbhag 600 karod rupye kaa ghaataa hua he, suri ne aarope lagaaya ki notebandi ke baad se toll-tex, nai propetiyon kii registry, van time parking charge main bhi kami ai he

 aapako bataa den ki notebandi ke baad se south emsidi main lagbhag 100 karod rupye sampatti kar ke taur par jamaa hue the

 jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main CRPF ke kafile par hue aatanki hamale ke baad ek baar phir ardhsainik balon ko milane vaali suvidhaon par bahes chhid gai he
 On the other hand, retired paramilitary forces from different states of the country are reaching Jantar Mantar in Delhi on 3 March
 darasal, in logon kii maang he ki unhen milane vaali neshnal pension skim (NPS) kii bajaae puraani pension skim lagu kii jaae
 Please tell here that the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee has implemented the National Pension Scheme by abolishing the old pension scheme from 2004
 sawaal he ki aakhir NPS kya he, jise khatm kar ardhsainik bal puraani pension behaal karana chaahate hai
 Prior to 2004, the beneficial pension scheme was in force for the paramilitary force personnel including CRPF and BSF
 puraani pension yojana main karmchaaree ko apane vetan se kuch nahin dena hota tha
 At the same time, the soldiers used to get about 50 percent of their salary in the last month after retirement as pension
 lekin 1 janvari 2004 se ardhsainik balon samet anya sarkari karmchaariyon ke liye neshnal pension skim (NPS) lagu kii gai
 Under this scheme, about 10 per cent of the basic salary of the paramilitary forces is paid to the employee and 14 per cent is paid by the government
 yahaan bataa den ki sena ko ritairement ke baad puraani vyavastha ke tahat hi pension di jaati he
 Indian Army personnel get more facilities than paramilitary personnel, this includes services of canteen, army school etc
 pehle 10 fisadi kii madad karti thi sarkaarpahale centre sarkaar kii ore se NPS main yogadan 10 fisadi kaa tha lekin beete saal yah 4 fisadi badhaakar 14 fisadi karne kaa elaan kiya gaya
 With this, 60% of the amount withdrawn after retirement was tax-free
 is yojana ke tahat ritairement ke samay kul pension fund kaa 60 fisadi nikaala ja saktaa he, baaki 40 fisadi kaa nivesh nishchit aay utpaadon yaa share equity main kiya ja saktaa he
 Earlier there was a provision to withdraw only 40 percent
 kya he ardhsainik balon kii makerdhasainik bal se jude sanghathan pichley kai saalon se yah maang kar rahe hai ki unhen bhi sena kii tarah hi van rank-van pension mili
 Its rationale is that CRPF, BSF, ITBP, CISF, SSB have an important contribution with the Indian Army in the country's internal security and border security
 aise main unhen bhi samaan rup se puraani pension yojana kaa laabh diya jaae
 Madhya Pradesh Minister makes serious allegations against Digvijay Singh - Digvijay Singh makes illegal mining and liquor smuggling minister's aunt is also Digvijay Umang Singhar has spread sensation

 Local leader has been heralded by a prominent minister of the government for making serious allegations like illegal mining and smuggling of alcohol on senior party leader Digvijay Singh
 rajya kii raajnneeti main thodaa ateet main jane par pataa chalata he ki umang singhar ke parivaar kii digvijay singh se puraani siyaasi dushmani rahi he
 While being Deputy Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, her aunt Jamuna Devi has been known for opening a front against the then Chief Minister Digvijay Singh
 kamalnath se jamuna devi kaa takaraav tab madhya pradesh kii raajnneeti main surkhiyon main rahata tha
 Even Jamuna Devi once said - "I am burning in Digvijay Singh's oven"

 mana ja rahaa he ki umangh singhar apni buaa ke nakshekadam par chalakar digvijay singh kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Is the local politics of Dhar district also cited as a reason behind opening a front against Umangdigvijay Singh, who was fueled by the promotion of rival leader
 kaha ja rahaa he ki dhar jile kii manavar seat se vidhayak va jais sangrakshak dow
 Digvijay Singh is promoting Hiralal in politics
 chunki heeralaal bhi party ke adivasee chehre hai, isse umang singhar ko lagata he ki digvijay singh unke raajnneetik pratidwandi ko bada cheharaa banane kii koshish main hai
 With this, Umang Singhar is worried about his politics being affected
 sutron kii maane to in sab baton ne unhen digvijay singh ke khilaaf khadaa kar diya he
 Senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia has stood openly with Umang Singhar speaking against Digvijay Singh due to the way scindia-digvijay Noorakushti is believed to be behind the whole incident due to the ongoing cold war between Scindia and Digvijaya Singh
 sindhiya or digvijay singh kai maukon par ek duusare kaa virodh kar chuke hai
 Mutual protests between them have also come up as rhetoric on several occasions
 chunki kamalnath mukhyamantri bhi hai or party ke pradesh adhyaksh bhi
 Because of this, he is running in both Digvijay Singh's government and the organization due to his close proximity
 jabaki vidhansabha chunaav main jeet ke baad mukhyamantri kii daavedaari jataane par bhi sindhiya ko pad nahin mila
 Due to the protest, the post of state president has not been given
 isse sindhiya kaa khemaa sarkaar or sanghathan donon jagah khud ko kamjor mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Sources reveal that this thing was passing on to the Scindia camp
 ek yah bhi vajah he digvijay singh ke khilaaf umang singhar ke morcha kholane kii

 uttarakhand main bijepi ke anusuchit jati ke dwaara sahabhoj main na keval kaaryakartaaon ne balki mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ne bhi shaamil hokar ek misaal pesh karne kii koshish kii
 But this was just an effort
 kyonki jis bhoj ke liye unako aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 There, food was brought from the homes of all scheduled caste workers
 usee bhojan main se kuch rotiyaan or sabji alag se nikaali gai or forencik jaanch karai gai
 After this the Chief Minister was served food
 bataa den ki baba sahab dow bhimrao ambedkar kii jayanti se thik ek din pehle bijepi ne is bhoj kaa aayojan kiya
 In this, he tried to give a message to the Scheduled Castes that the only BJP which always stands for him
 bijepi bhedbhaav ko naa maanate hue sabhi virgon ko ek samaan maanati thi or maanati rahegi
 In conversation with 'aaj Tak', Trivendra Singh Rawat said, 'I do not discriminate between caste and people
 lekin meri suraksha cholekar ye jaanchaki gai hogi
 He also openly supported the Yogi government on the Kuldeep Sengar case
 unhone kaha ki vahaan kii sarkaar ne nirnay liya he
 i think an MLA is a responsible person
 har kisi ke apane adhikaar hai
 If someone says that i have been falsely accused, then it is okay
 uttar pradesh sarkaar ne pehle esaiti kaa gathan kiya or ab cese sibiai ke paas he
 At the same time, former Chief Minister of Uttarakhand Harish Rawat said that when the Chief Minister did not trust his own scheduled caste workers
 to aise main unhen vahaan jaakar unka apmaan nahin karnaa chahie
 He said, 'I said that i will go to the homes of 100 scheduled families and eat there
 main aisa hi kar rahaa hum
 He said that what was the danger between them in such rotis and that too in the rotios that came from their workers' homes
 agar sirf ek hi parivaar se khaanaa aata to samajha ja saktaa tha
 But who would send in such a meal, even the eater himself would not know
 aise main ye unka apmaan hi he or kuch nahin
 Is a straight gimmick
 rio olympic-2016 main pehla hi muqabla haarane vaale yogeshwar dutt, bollywood star salmaan khan ke prashansakon ke nishane par hai
 Bronze medalist Yogeshwar of the London Olympics was considered a strong medal contender for India in Rio, but lost his first match to Mongolian Wrestler
 yogeshwar kaa olympic se is tarah baahar hona unke phens or bhartiya khelpremiyon ke liye bade jatke se kam nahin tha
 Defeat and victory are part of any sport, but some people have not missed out on social media by taking a pinch on Yogeshwar's defeat
 tippaniyan Most of the comments against Yogeshwar have been made on social media, referring to Bollywood star Salman Khan
 isse sanket miltaa he ki ye tvatir yujar salmaan ke fain hai
 Significantly, when Salman Khan was made the brand ambassador of the Indian contingent for the Rio Olympics, Yogeshwar opposed it
 unhone twit ke jariye kaha tha ki desh main piti ushaa, milkha singh jaise bade star hai jinhone desh ke liye sammaan arjeet kiya, is ambesder ne khel ke kshetra main kya kiya
 It seems that some fans of Salman are considering Yogeshwar's weak performance in Rio as an opportunity to target this particular Indian wrestler
 vaise itnaa tay he ki yogeshwar ke khilaaf nishaanaa sadhate hue jis asabhy bhashaa kaa upyog kiya gaya he, vah nindaneey he
 One Twitter user wrote, it seems that Yogeshwar was not ready for this match

 ab puraa cheharaa dikhataa he

 Cancer treatment is very expensive

 This session was called The Empress of Maladies: How i beat cancer
 What it taught me ne moderet kiya
 Apart from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP President Amit Shah, many heavyweights from politics, arts, cinema are joining the conclave
 bollywood se ranvir singh or kangana ranut jaise actors bhi shaamil ho rahe hai
 The one who wins knows when to fight and when not to
 —sun tju, art of warpakistan ko lekar narendra modi kaa ashavad to aktubar 2014 main hi khatm ho gaya tha jab jammu-kashmir main antarrashtriya seemaa par pakistan ne baari golabari shuru kii thi
 On 8 October, the security forces were giving a befitting reply to Pakistan until the Prime Minister arrived at Air Force Day's party, home of Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha
 bharat agar chahta to us vannt bhi yah tevar dikhaa saktaa tha jo guuruuvaar 29 sitambar ko najar aae
 However, despite that retort (which was true too), the Prime Minister not only assured that everything would be well soon, but returning from Russia in December 2015, he stopped in Lahore and shocked many
 yah kisi bhartiya pradhanmantri kii das saal main pehali pakistan yatra thi or vah bhi achaanak
 India is constantly fighting Pakistan
 pichley do saal main yah jang chhadam or pratyaksh, donon tarah se gahan or sthaayee ho chuki he
 India would have been able to explain the success achieved in earlier encounters and the success of stopping infiltration attempts with the same attitude as today, but in Sun Tzu, "he is the one who knows when to fight
" 
 ’’ shaayad is baar kai paimaanon par bharat ke liye sahi mauka tha jab apane sanyam kii niyantran rekha pakistan ko dikhaa sake
 Sun Tzu also said that the attack should be taken only when its benefits are seen
 pradhanmantri modi ke liye sakchat dikhnaa na keval unki gharelu raajnneeti ke liye anivaary tha balki dakshin asia main badalte shakti santulan main bharat ke rasookh ko banaae rakhane ke liye bhi jaruri tha
 In this column we wrote last week that India will have to share courage, wisdom and restraint in dealing with Pakistan and keep its risks and risks to a minimum
 is paimaane par guuruuvaar kii subah kii karrwai saahasik or sanyamit thi
 The action was against the terrorists and took place after the Uri attack, so Pakistan had nothing to react to
 pratyaksh rup se yah karrwai niyantran rekha ke aasapaas hui bataai gai
 India did not even directly declare the 2003 ceasefire violation nor indicated the continuation of this action
 yah sab karte hue modi ne gharelu raajnneeti main nuksaan ko tham liya or siyaasi dabaav ko pressure valve uplabdh kara diya jo udi hamale ke baad bana tha
 The diplomatic aspects of this campaign are more important than the strategic aspects which have forced Modi to bluntly appear
 udi hamale ke baad pakistan ke khilaaf kootnithik abhiyaanon main bharat kii safalataa mili juli rahi he
 Despite India's pressure, Russia did not cancel military exercises with Pakistan
 dakshin asia ke shakti santulan main china pakistan ke saath he
 The cancellation of SAARC is symbolic, but Pakistan did not see any immediate lesson from it
 sindhu samjhaute ko simit karnaa yaa vyapaar sambandhon par roak aise kadam hai jinka asar lambey samay main honge
 Meanwhile, terrorist efforts and cross-border shelling continued even after the Uri attack
 is surat main na keval gharelu raajnneeti ke liye balki dakshin asia kii ranneetik bisaat ke mutabik bhi tevar dikhaanaa bharat ke liye jaruri tha
 "if you know yourself and even the enemy, even if there are hundreds of battles, there is no need to fear the consequences"
 Sun Tzu's mantra is, in fact, the title of India's next tangle
 pakistan ko sandesh to diya gaya lekin mushkil ab yahaan se shuru hoti he
 Prime Minister Modi also knows the needs, prospects, hopes and challenges of India and also the mood and conspiracy of Pakistan
 is baat kii koi guarantee nahin he ki taaje sabak ke baad pakistan main aatank kii factory band ho jaaegi balki uske doguni takat se aage aane kaa dar he
 If this happens then what will be the next control line of restraint? Obviously Modi will not want to do it again and again against Pakistan which he has to do this time but there is no guarantee that Pakistan will not try its designs
 bharat, pakistan ke saath tanaav lekar ji saktaa he lekin takaraav lekar nahin
 Prime Minister Modi will have to remove the entire dialogue related to his government from the shadow of Pakistan and bring it towards growth, development and prosperity because in its absence, the losses to India will be bigger
 isliye shaayad bharat ko antat: ranneeti ke us puraane siddhant kii taraf lautnaa hoga ki hamale kii sthiti main jeet yaa haar, donon sambhavit hai
 Immunity has to be strengthened if it is to be invincible
 pakistan, narendra modi ke liye atal bihari vaajapeyi yaa manmohan singh kii tulana main zyada badi chunauti he
 In the politics of domestic politics, Indira Gandhi wants to see Bangladesh making them, whereas the politics of global politics demands Vajpayee-like goodwill and on the third side she has to create a safe and secure image of India so that people can invest and do business here
 pakistan par sakchat karrwai ke baad ab modi ko udaartaa, chaturata or aakraamakata kaa behad najuk santulan bananaa hoga, jisamen unhen desh ke bheetar rajnatik sahmati kii jarurat hogi taaki sangharshahin vijay hasil ho sake
 The greatest art of war is that the enemy be defeated without fighting

 unhone apni yachika main court se tihaad jail prashasan ko nirbhaya cese ke doshiyon ko jald faansee dene kaa nirdesh dene kii maang kii he
 When the incident took place on December 16, 2012, in Delhi, 23-year-old Nirbhayya gang-raped gangsters in a moving bus
 gangrape ke baad chalati bas se use sadak par phenk diya gaya tha
 Nirbhaya, who was seriously injured, died during treatment

 While a minor accused is free after completing his sentence from the Juvenile Justice Board
 iske alaava 4 aropiyon ko supreme court ne doshi qaraar diya tha
 The 1993 blasts changed the picture of Mumbai
 saath hi anderworld ko bhi badal diya
 Then one end of the underworld joined terrorism and Dawood Ibrahim went on the path of terrorism, becoming the International Criminal
 yahi vajah he ki mumbai kii galiyon main daaud ke saath aparaadh kaa khel khilne vaala chota rajan dharaa gaya to sabake jehan main ek sawaal hi sawaal he ki daaud kab aayega?ab bharat ko he daaud kaa intjaardarasal, 80 ke dashak tak mumbai main koi bhi bada aparaadh hota tha to uskaa syraadaaud or chota rajan se judatatha
 But whenever Mumbai was injured by terrorism after the 1993 blasts, Dawood's name was first drawn
 chunavi mudda ban gaya dauunderworld dondood ibrahim itnaa bada namban gaya he ki america uskaa zikr karne se nahin chukta
 India has also named Dawood every time in talks with Pakistan
 kai baar daaud se jude saboot saunpe gaye or ab to daaud chunavi mudda tak ban gaya he
 Rajan knows that many details of Dawood, Rajan has so much information about Dawood and how important these information is now, it can not be said, but there is no two opinions that little Rajan was close to Dawood and also an enemy
 
 use daaud ke tamaam raaj maaloom hote the
 And even today, there are many similar secrets in his chest
 mumbai ko he chota rajan kaa intjaardaaud kaa kaarobaar 50 se zyada deshon main failaa he to chota rajan ne bhi apana kaarobaar khub failaayaa
 Now that Chota Rajan is trapped, Mumbai is waiting for him because he can probably open some such secrets of Dawood, which has never been heard till now

 Premium charges apply !! BJP President Nitin Gadkari is always ready to talk happily on his business success
 is baatcheet main kabhi bhi yah shaamil nahin hota ki unhone is kamyaabi ke liye kin sadhano kaa istemaal kiya
 Now that the revelations have removed the curtain from the mysterious phase of his life, in such a situation, there is no longer any credibility worth attacking Congress corruption
 bijepi adhyaksh ke rup main unke pad par bhi sawalia nishaan lag gaye hai
 The most damaging allegation against Gadkari is that they had a financially beneficial relationship with construction company Ideal Road Builders (IRB)
 asal main 1995 or 1999 ke bich maharashtra main jab shivasena-bijepi kii sarkaar thi to us dauraan gadakari rajya main lok nirmaan (peedblyoody) mantri the
 He made his mark by completing several ambitious projects including the 65 km long mumbai-pune Expressway
 unke kaarykaal ke dauraan iarabi ko 194 karod ru
 Contracts were received
 iarabi kii sthapana dattatreya mhisakar ne 1977 main kii thi or ab company ko unke bete virendra mhisakar chalaa rahe hai
 Gadkari helped Dattatreya while he had experience of building only 10 km of road before joining the group of big contractors in 1995
 iarabi ne 1995 se 2012 ke bich 3,000 kimi lambii sadaken banaain
 The Mhaiskar family has now raised Rs 3,250 crore
 kaa samrajya khadaa kar liya he or forbs kii 2011 kii sabase dhani bharatiyon kii suchi main virendra ko 78wein paaydaan par rakhaa gaya he
 The path of rapid growth of the company from small contractor to big business begins only during Gadkari as PWD minister
 maharashtra kii satta se baahar hone ke baad gadakari ne april 2000 main chini or bijli kaarobaar main utarane ke liye purti group kii sthapana kii
 Dattatreya sold 8 per cent shares of Purti Group for Rs 2 crore
 main kharidkar usamen nivesh kiya
 The most controversial thing is that since 2000 only Rs 64 crore
 kaa record ghaataa uthaane vaale purti group ko 2010 main global sefti vijan privet limited ne 164 karod ru
 Gave a loan of yah company mhisakar parivaar se judi thi
 The loan was given at an interest rate of 14 per cent
 ek bayaan main purti group ne daawa kiya he ki is karj ke liye jamaanat ke rup main kai jameen ke kagajaat die gaye the
 Purti located Umred near Nagpur 47
 69 hectare jameen tathaa imaaraten or nagpur ke besa sthit plant or mashinari ko girvee rakhaa jo group ke daawey ke mutabik 250 karod ru
 Belonged to gadakari ko yah bataanaa hoga ki jab unke paas 250 karod ru
 If there was a bail arrangement, why did they not take loans from banks at low interest
 bijepi adhyaksh ne marathi channel ibn-lokmat ko 20 aktubar ko bataaya ki unki company kaa bahi-khaataa aisa nahin tha ki bank unhen udhaar detaa, isliye unhone apane 'achche dost' dattatreya se madad maangi
 But this does not match the value of his company's assets
 kuch bhi ho, aisi company se lone lenaa jise unke mantri rahane ke dauraan phayda pahunchaa ho, gambhir naitik sawaal to khadey karata hi he
 People's eyebrows are also raised that the loan amount given to Purti Group was Rs 145 crore in 2010
 ke turnover se bhi zyada he
 The relationship between Mahiskar's companies — IRB Infrastructure Developers (IRB Infra) and Global Safety Vision — is also being mooted
 iarabi is baat se inkaar kar rahi he ki global sefti vijan kabhi uski sahaayak company rahi he
 "neither IRB Infra nor any of its subsidiaries have ever made Global Safety Vision Pvt
 li
 Promised or invested an investment in
 '' yah aadha sach he
 It is true that Global Safety Vision has never been a subsidiary of IRB Infra
 vah vastav main iarabi inphra kii pramotor companiyon main se he
 IRB Infra in its prospectus dated February 8, 2008, has revealed on page 163 that "global Safety Vision Promoter is a group entity"
 ''gadakari is baat par jor dete hai ki yah lone asal main ek dost kii duusare jaruratmand dost ko madad se zyada kuch nahin he
 Such friendship has made Robert Vadra, the son-in-law of Congress President Sonia Gandhi, in trouble
 gadakari ke mutabik, iarabi ne apane bahikhaate ke aadhaar par paisa jutaya, bazaar se zyada byaaj par unki companiyon ko us rakam ko karj ke rup main diya or munafa kamaaya
 Purti Group said in a statement released on 23 October that so far it has paid only Rs 62 crore including interest
 chukaaye hai
 There is also substantial evidence that Purti Group has not adhered to corporate governance in case of violation of business ethics
 purti group main jin kai companiyon ke nivesh kaa daawa kiya gaya he ve farji pate vaali dikhaawati form hai
 Purti, for example, claims investments from Nivita Traders, swiftsol, Ashwamy Sales & Marketing, Rigma fintrade and Arnwell Traders, all of which are registered at the same address in Dubey Chawl in Andheri (east), Mumbai
 vahaan rahane vaala koi bhi vyakti in companiyon ke bare main kuch nahin jaanata
 After all, the purpose of the transaction was not doubtful, so why were such ostentatious companies set up? Some other investors take the example of Vidya Buildcon, Pine Infrastructure and Roller Multitrade
 inkaa registration fort, mumbai ke hajarimal somani maarg sthit shrinivas house ke pate par he jabaki yah imaarat somani group kaa headquarter he
 Five other investor companies, Chariot Investrade, Leverage fintrade, Regency Equifin, Sterlite Fincom and Jasika Mercantile have been given the building under construction in Andheri
 purti power and sugar limited ke purv managing diarector sudhir deeve kehete hai ki niveshak companiyon ke galat pate ko bahut tool nahin dena chahie
 "all these companies are following the rules and regulations," he told reporters in Nagpur on 23 October
 hamen lagata he ki kuch paton ko dene main kuch bhram ho gaya he
 This does not mean that there is some fraud
 ''aisi kuch dikhaawati companiyon ke diarectors kii paatrata bhi sandehaaspad he
 Gadkari's driver in two of these companies is Manohar Panse director
 khabaron ke mutabik, paanse ko aisi kisi bhi company main apana naam hone kii jaankaree nahin he
 Sagar Kotwaliwale, an employee of Purti Group, is a director in two such companies
 navi mumbai ke rahane vaale jyotishi vishnu sharma bhi ek company ke diarector hai
 Due to lack of eligibility of director of any company among these people, there is a doubt that their name has been used in benami transactions
 korporate maamalon ke mantri em
 Veerappa Moily has said that the government will conduct a thorough investigation of corporate governance in Purti
 bijepi main gadakari ke liye koi aansu bhi nahin baha rahaa he
 If something is visible, then the feeling of complacency that the RSS usually shows hypocrisy is left in a lurch
 bijepi ke varisht netaa ram jethmalani ne kah diya he ki gadakari ko adhyaksh pad chhod dena chahie
 However, other senior BJP leaders are leaving it to the RSS to decide Gadkari's future
 dilli ke ek varisht bijepi netaa ne kaha, ''yahi uchit hoga ki gadakari ke nagpur sthit salaahkaar hi yah tay karen ki ve unhen party adhyaksh ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate hai yaa nahin
 After all, it was he who decided to make Gadkari the president for the second time
 ''yah mudda himachal pradesh or gujarat ke aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav or loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii sambhaavnaaon par asar daal saktaa he
 If the election of the party president is left to the BJP, then it could bring in Sushma Swaraj, Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha and Arun Jaitley in the Rajya Sabha
 goa ke mukhyamantri manohar parrikar kaa naam bhi adhyaksh pad ke daavedaar ke rup main ubhara he
 When Gadkari was approached, he refused to give any explanation
 unhone kaha, ''main pehle hi kah chukaa ki main jaanch kaa saamana karne ko taiyaar hum
 At a function held in Nagpur on October 24, he held long-term meetings with many top officials, including Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat
 sutron ke mutabik, gadakari se safai maangi gai thi jo unhone de di he
 But it is not known whether Bhagwat is satisfied with this or not
 lekin sangh gadakari kii sammanjanak vidaai par vichaar kar rahaa he
 However, on October 24, unexpectedly, Advani said in his favor that accusing Gadkari was actually an attempt to neutralize the corruption charges against the upa's own government
 adwani ne kaha, ''upie samoochee rajnatik jamaat ko ek jaisaa dikhaanaa chahta he taaki uske akshamya paapon kaa asar kam ho or usase bachaa ja sake
 i believe that BJP should be of a different kind and we do not claim to be spared on any basis on the allegations made
 ''adwani ke is bayaan se party ke bheetar bechaini bad gai he kyonki sabhi netaa jaanate hai ki zyaadaatar masalon par adwani or gadakari main kam hi patati he
 Advani brought it openly on his blog on May 31, 2012
 isse kuch din pehle hi bijepi kii mumbai main hui rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main gadakari ko doosraa kaarykaal dene kaa faisla kiya gaya tha
 Writing that the 'mood in the party is not optimistic', Advani criticized Gadkari's decisions
 party netaa ab bhi is hriday parivartan par achraj kar rahe hai
 Perhaps this is not enough to save Gadkari

 It is noteworthy that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said in the budget 2018 that investment in bitcoin is illegal and the government will try its best to curb it
 vitt mantri ne kaha tha, 'sarkaar krypto karency ko legal tender nahin maanati or inke istemaal ko khatm karne ke liye sabhi upaay kiye jaaenge
 The government is also preparing to make crypto currencies illegal in the payment system and a regulator to monitor the exchange traded on them
 sarkaar ne krypto karency se jude masalon ko dekhne ke liye ek samiti banaai he jo 31 march tak apni report degi
 Business of 10 thousand crores! According to an estimate, Bitcoin business in India ranges from 5,000 to 10,000 crores and on an average two lakh people have registered every month in Bitcoin exchanges

 Despite losing the T20 and ODI series against India, West Indies captain Jason Holder and his team are all set for the World Test Championship
 donon tiimon ke bich do maichon kii test siries kheli jaaegi
 The first Test match starts in Antiga on Thursday

 ' kalyaan-dombiwali nigam chunaav main behrin pradarshan se utsahit shivasena ne mangalvaar ko apane mukhpatr ke jariye janata kaa shukriya kiya he
 Interestingly, in the article 'saamana', where it did not leave a chance of sarcasm on the BJP, it has also indicated the ceasefire
 shivasena ne likhaa he ki chunaavon ke dauraan jo kuch bhi hota he, vah asthai hota he
 The Shiv Sena has written in an editorial in the mouthpiece 'saamana', "during the campaign for KDMC elections a lot of mud was created between BJP and Shiv Sena, but we should respectfully accept the people's mandate
 chunaav ke dauraan jo kuch bhi hota he, vah asthai hota he or hamen puraani baton ko bhul janaa chahie
 `` The aggressive attitude of Shiv Sena before the election, which led to a new deterioration in its relations with the ally BJP, hinting at a softening of the same aggressive attitude, Shiv Sena said that everyone should be taken along to ensure development
 shivasena ne kaha, 'ham kalyaan or dombiwali ke vikaas ko lekar chintit hai or isliye janata hamen bahumat ke kagaar par lekar ai he
 To ensure development, we need to ensure that everyone walks together

 And some sarcasm, Bhishivasena says that in front of the roaring of his lions, the other political parties flew like dry leaves
 lekh main aage likhaa gaya he, 'kalyaan-dombiwali main mukhyanmatri or unke sipahsalaaron ne apni puri rajnatik pratishtha daanv par lagaai thi

 'the party has further written that Tararani will have to give credit for bjp's victory in Kolhapur Corporation election also

 The Shiv Sena has written about the pain of bjp's Beed, writing, 'in a place like Beed, BJP has suffered badly
 vahaan rashtravaadi ne chalaang lagaai he, yah drishy acha nahin he
 "why change the mood of the people?" Shiv Sena, who is in power with the BJP in the state, has written that the mood of the people has started to change after one year of formation of the government in the state
 yah kyon hua, is ore mukhyamantri ko vichaar karnaa hoga
 Shiv Sena has further written, 'we humbly accept the decision given by the public

 On the other hand, there is also a confusion about the program of protest because a MCD chief said that the Municipal Corporation has not allowed it to be held at Ramlila Maidan whereas the Anna side insisted that they It has been approved
 anna ke andolan par vishesh kawarejemasidi kii sthaayee samiti ke adhyaksh yogendra chandoliya ne kaha ki hajaare ko agle maheene virodh pradarshan karne ke liye ramlila maidan kaa istemaal karne kii ijaajat nahin di gai he

 Sonia Gandhi is the head of the Indian National Congress and the wife of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
 1991 main rajeev gandhi kii hatya ke baad congress ne unhen party kaa pad sanbhaalane kaa aagrah kiya, lekin unhone ise lene se inkaar kar diya or kaha ki ve raajnneeti se dur rahanaa chaahati hai
 However, Sonia Gandhi took primary membership of Congress in 1997 and in 1998 she was elected President of Congress
 tab se vah congress party kii adhyaksh hai
 Sonia Gandhi was elected the leader of the six-party UPA alliance after winning the 2004 Lok Sabha elections
 sitambar 2010 main ve phir se chauthi baar congress kii adhyaksh chuni gai
 He has the record of being the longest-serving president in the 125-year history of the Congress Party
 rashtriya salaahkaar parishad kaa pad ek laabh kaa pad hone par uthe vivaad ke baad sonia gandhi ne 23 march 2006 ko parishad se or loksabhaa kii sadsyta se istipha de diya tha
 The opposition was alleged to have violated the principle of office of profit
 haalanki baad main sansad ne laabh ke pad ko lekar ek vidheyak paarit kiya jisamen rashtriya salaahkaar parishad ke adhyaksh ke pad ko laabh ke pad se mukt kar diya gaya
 In 2006, she again won the election from Rae Bareli
 sonia ke netritv main congress niti upie sarkaar 2009 main phir se aam chunaav main bahumat ke kareeb pahunch gai
 The Congress itself won 206 seats, which was the highest number of seats a party has received since 1991
 loksabhaa chunaav main jeet hasil karne ke liye netaa or partiyaan puri jaan laga rahe hai
 Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has given an open warning to his leaders and ministers
 amarinder ne likhit bayaan main apane mantriyon, netaaon or vidhayakon se kaha he ki vah party ko apane-apane ilaake main jitvaayen, agar aisa nahin hota he to unhen mantri pad se haath khona pad saktaa he
 Captain Amarinder said in his strong message that the ministers whose areas the party did not win will be discharged from the cabinet
 yani ab chunaav main parformens ke aadhaar par hi mantriyon kaa bhavishya tay kiya jayega
 At the same time, mlas have been told that the MLA in which the area lost votes will not be given a ticket in the next assembly elections
 itnaa hi nahin punjab sarkaar main chayarmen pad bhi loksabhaa chunaavon main pradarshan ke tahat milegaa
 Under this, the message has been given that not only being a senior but on the basis of performance in their constituencies in the Lok Sabha elections will get a position in the government or party
 mukhyamantri kii taraf se kaha gaya he ki iskaa makasad parformens besd culture ko party main badhaava dena he
 The Punjab cabinet also includes Congress star campaigners like Navjot Singh Sidhu, who are campaigning not only in Punjab but across the country
 aapako bataa den ki punjab main kul 13 siton par loksabhaa chunaav ke aakhri charan yani 12 may ko matdaan hona he
 This time in Punjab, there was a triangular contest between Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, bjp-akali Dal
 gauratlab he ki congress ne is baar punjab ke dangal main sunil jakhad, manish tiwari jaise diggajon ko utaara he
 So from the BJP, cinema giants like Kiran Kher, Sunny Deol are in the fray
 punjab main kul 13 siten:gurdaspur, amritsar, jalandhar, hoshiyarpur, anandpur sahib, ludhiana, fatehgarh sahib, faridakot, ferozepur, bathinda, sangrur, patiala, khadur sahibachunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main

 In Western civilization, the relationship which was named husband-wife, we call it husband and wife
 pati shabd kaa arth hota he- swami yaa maalik
 For example, in the Vedas we find many words such as Jupiter, Praja-pati
 vaachas-pati, pashu-pati, bhu-pati
 The use of the husband suffix '
 
 
 kaa maalik' ke taur par istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Such words like millionaire and millionaire mean - lord of crores or millions
 agar ek swami he to taarkik rup se doosraa das he
 This word is also being realized in married life
 'swami' shabd se khud hi kai visheshadhikaar mil jate hai

 He said that the whole matter is of 2013-14

 Through this company, Modi acquired these assets

 Modi raised a number of questions giving details of new assets to Tejashwi Yadav's argument that the railway which the CBI has registered a land case for making goods in exchange for the property against him, at that time did not even have his mustache

 On the one hand, while relations with JDU are running strained, on the other hand former Deputy Chief Minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sushil Kumar Modi continues to be a headache for the party
 susheel modi or argedy main pichley kaaphi samay se shah-maat kaa khel jari he
 Meanwhile, on Monday, Modi met the Chief Election Commissioner and submitted a memorandum in which he demanded the cancellation of Bihar Health Minister Tej Pratap Yadav's membership of the Assembly
 modi ne aarope lagaaya ki chunaav ladane ke dauraan tejpratap ne shapathpatr main ayog ko sahi jaankaree nahin di he
 Sushil Modi once again surrounded Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav in today's press conference
 modi ne tejasvi yadav ke us tark ki unke khilaaf sibiai ne jis railway ke sampatti ke badale maal banane ke liye jameen kaa maamla darj kiya he us samay unki moonch dadhi bhi nahin thi par nae sampattiyon ke byore dete hue kai sawaal kiye
 Modi first clarified that the CBI has recently filed a case against him on the basis that Tejashwi became a director in Delight Marketing and owns 94 crore assets in quantity 65 lakhs and at that time he was 24 years old
 modi ne aarope lagaaya ki tejasvi yadav ke naam se do sampatti us samay registerd kii gai jab unki umr maatr teen saal thi
 According to Modi, Tejashwi Yadav has 26 properties from Gopalganj, Patna to Delhi, in which the owner of 13 properties became a minor
 modi ke anusaar jab naaballig rahane par unhone kabhi is baat kaa virodh nahin kiya ki aakhir ye sampatti unke naam kyon kii ja rahi hai, tab ab mukadmaa hone par wo ye daleel kyon de rahe hai
 Though there has been no response from Tejashwi Yadav or his father Lalu Yadav to the latest statement and accusation of Sushil Modi, but the party's national spokesperson said that with Modi's statement we are once again apprehensive that i will be Central agencies are about to file some more new cases to break
 lekin sawaal yah hai ki aakhir rajd yaa tejasvi yadav apane upar lage aaropon kaa tathyavaar jawaab kyon nahin dete
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself made this statement in front of his party leaders last Tuesday that those who are accused should answer based on authentic facts
 is par rajd adhyaksh lalu yadav or khud tejasvi yadav ne kaha tha ki unke khilaaf saare aarope raajnneeti se prerit hai, lekin janata dal united isse santust nahin dikhi
 Meanwhile, the Rashtriya Janata Dal has not yet come up with any solution on Nitish Kumar's request for mediation to the Congress party high command
 or rajd ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki congress party pehle himachal ke mukhyamantri virbhadra singh kaa istipha karwaae tab tejasvi yadav kaa istipha maange
 The Congress leaders are silent on this, but the leaders of Janata Dal United say that on the basis of such a charge sheet, they can give the example of Madan Mitra of the Trinamool Government of Bengal who remained a minister even after going to jail
 rashtriya janata dal ke netaa aashwast hai ki mahagathbandhan chalaane ke liye nitish, charge shit hone tak kuch sharton ke aadhaar par mantri pad par bane rahane denge
 But due to nitish-lalu deadlock in the state, its effect can be clearly seen on the development works
 jahaan tejpratap or tejasvi yadav ne apane karyaalay janaa band kar diya he, vahiin nitish kumaar ne bhale vibhageeya kaaryon kii samiksha kerani shuru kar di he
 But when the dialogue between the two big parties of the Grand Alliance is also stopped, it is bound to have an impact on the work of the government
 bataa den ki bhaajapa ke varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi ne purv main mantriyon kaa istipha liye jane kaa udhaaharan pesh karte hue bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se bhrashtachar ke maamle main upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav kaa istipha liye jane kii maang kii he
 Sushil, who has been continuously accusing RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his family for 'benami property' for the past one and a half months, addressed RJD chief Lalu Prasad while addressing journalists in Patna, point-by-point response to the charge leveled against him and his family
 Also challenged to give

 Modi alleged that while contesting the election, Tej Pratap has not given the correct information to the Commission in the affidavit
 haalanki susheel modi ke taaja bayaan or aarope par tejasvi yadav yaa unke pita lalu yadav ne koi pratikriya nahin di he, lekin party ke rashtriya pravaktaa ne kaha ki modi ke bayaan se hame is baat kii ek baar phir ashanka ho rahi hai ki mahagathbandhan ko todane ke liye kuch or nae maamle kendriya agenciyaan darj karne vaali he
 But the question is why RJD or Tejashwi Yadav do not give factual answers to the allegations against them
 khud mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne pichley mangalvaar ko apane party ke netaaon ke saamne ye bayaan diya tha ki jinke upar aarope lage unhen pramanik tathyon ke aadhaar par jawaab dena chahie
 On this RJD President Lalu Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav themselves had said that all the allegations against them are politically motivated, but Janata Dal United did not appear satisfied with this

 haryana ke hisar se saansad dushyant chautaala ne shanivaar ko kaha ki jananaayak janata party (JJP) purv uppradhanmantri devilal kii nitiyon va vichaardhaara kii party he or har varg ko apane saath lekar chalane ke liye sankalpabaddh he
 Dushyant Chautala was addressing villagers in the deserted village of Jind light
 iske saath hi JJP ne upachunaav ke liye apane prachaar abhiyaan kaa shankhanaad kar diya
 Let us tell you that in August 2018, Harichand Midha, MLA of Indian National Lok Dal was killed, after which Jind assembly seat was vacated
 ab isi par upachunaav ho rahe hai
 On reaching the uninhabited village, people warmly welcomed MP Dushyant Chautala, according to the news agency language
 shanivaar ko unhone aadha darjan gaanvon main graminon ko sambodhit kiya
 Addressing the villagers, Dushyant said that Jind by-election is not a general election and this election will have far-reaching consequences
 unhone kaha ki upachunaav main janata dwaara liye gaye faisle kaa sidhaa asar pradesh kii bhavi raajnneeti par padegaa
 He said, 'the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) showed false sabbagas to the people of the state
 jhuthe vaayadon or jumalon ko aage badhaate hue manohar laal khatter sarkaar ne 4 varsh guzaar die or pradesh kii janata munh takati rahi
 During the BJP rule, the people of Jind also craved for basic amenities
 ’ saansad ne bhaajapa ke vikaas ke daavon ko khokhla bataate hue kaha ki jind kii jarjar sadaken or blaak pade siver yahaan manohar laal khatter sarkaar ke vikaas kii munh bolti tasviir ko bayaan karte hai
 He said that just by making rhetoric in media and public forums, development does not happen
 vikaas ke liye aadharbhoot dhaanche main parivartan kar vikaas kaary karwaane padate hai
 He said that Jind Light was completely sidelined by the BJP government
 yahaan kii janata bhaajapa ke is ravaiye ko bakhubi dekh rahi he or samasyaon ke rup main jhel bhi rahi he
 On Saturday, the MP visited the villages of Nijindhalke, Niranjan, Bohatwala, Raichand Wala, Ahirka, Jhanjh, Jalalpura, Railway Colony and Fountain Chowk area
 bihar kii mahagathbandhan sarkaar ke do mukhya sahyogi rashtriya janata dal or janata dal united ke bich mangalvaar ko ek baar phir se antarkalah dekhne ko najar aayaa, jab argedy ke kuch vidhayakon ne upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ko mukhyamantri banane kii maang ched di
 RJD mlas Surendra Yadav, Ramanuja and Minister Chandrashekhar from RJD Kota voiced support for Tejashwi
 argedy vidhayak surendra yadav ne kaha ki jis tareeke se uttar pradesh main akhilesh yadav achche tareeke se sarkaar chalaa rahe hai usee prakaar bihar main tejasvi yadav bhi sarkaar chalaa sakate hai
 Surendra Yadav said that the time has come that Tejashwi should now be made the chief minister
 lekin aag main jisane ghi kaa kaam kiya vah thaargedisupremeo lalu prasad yadav kaa bayaan
 In Hajipur, Lalu Yadav while answering the questions of journalists said that Akhilesh Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav are also future chief ministers as he himself and Mulayam Singh Yadav of Samajwadi Party are now old
 haalanki lalu ne philhal yah saaf kar diya ki is vakt bihar main mukhyamantri kii kursi ke liye vaikency nahin he, kyonki nitish kumaar mukhyamantri he or sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 By evening, Janata Dal United was also responded to those RJD mlas who are raising the issue of Tejashwi becoming the Chief Minister
 jadyu pravaktaa niraj kumaar ne kaha kii bihar chunaav se pahalelalu prasad yadavane nitish kumaar ko mahagathbandhan kaa netaa maan liya tha, aise main bihar main mukhyamantri ke liye vaikency nahin he
 However, taking a dig at Tejashwi, Neeraj said that Tejashwi will definitely have some qualities, due to which Surender Yadav, who was an MLA for many years, has also accepted him as his leader

 The last Lok Sabha election in Bhopal was in the headlines in 1991 for a particular reason
 vah khaas vajah thi ki congress ne purv bhartiya cricket captain mansoor ali khan pataudi urf tiger pataudi ko maidan main utaara tha
 They were then sided by the BJP
 si
 Verma had a severe defeat
 pataudi ke liye yah haar or adhik kadavi rahi kyonki unhen shikast us bhopal main mili jahaan kabhi unki nanihaal ke logon kii hukumat hua karti thi
 How strong the bjp's base in Bhopal can be understood is that the party has occupied this seat eight times in the last 30 years, although its candidates have been constantly changing
 ab 2019 par aate hai
 This time too, the political battle of Bhopal is making national headlines
 isaki vajah he is seat se donon pratidwandvi partiyon ke pratyaashee
 BJP has fielded Pragya Singh Thakur, accused of Malegaon blasts, against former Congress Chief Minister Digvijay Singh
 jaahir he, muqabla joardaar he or isaki vajah se bhopal par sabaki nazren jami hongi
 On the one hand there are former Chief Ministers with long experience of power, but due to continuous political attacks on them, their political ground has been lost
 rajya ke bhaajapa netaaon ne unhen pehle se hi madhya pradesh kaa bantadhaar karne vaala or vikaas virdohi prachaarit kar rakhaa he
 The right-wing BJP troll army has completed its image on social media as a Congress leader, the biggest enemy of Hindus
 digvijay singh ne apni 3,300 kilometre lambii narmada parikrama yatra ke madhyam se apni hindu virdohi chhavi ko badalane kii koshish kii he, saath hi 15 saal baad madhya pradesh main congress kii satta main vaapasi ke saath unka rajnatik rup se kayakalp hua he
 He also had a role as a key strategist in powering the Congress
 party ke andruni sutron kaa kahana he ki digvijay, bhopal se chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahate the lekin unke dost or mukhyamantri kamalnath ne unase bhopal se hi ladane kaa aagrah karke unhen vivash kar diya
 However, he has never backed down from a fierce fight, so agreed
 duusari taraf pragna singh thakur hai
 Born in Bhind, the name of this Sadhvi came to light as an accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast
 us dhamaake main chah log maare gaye the
 Pragya is ideal for the right-wing party
 apane shuruaati dinon main ve durga vahini or akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad (abivipi) kii sadsy thim or haal hi main unhone daawa kiya ki ve babari masjid ko giraane ke liye uske gumbad ke upar bhi chadh gai thim
 Pragya was released on bail in April 2017 but he is still an accused under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) as the court did not discharge him despite the National Investigation Agency (NIA) requesting him to be acquitted
 is
 bhopal ko bhaajapa ke liye surakshit seat mana jaataa he or party ke paas pratyaashiyon kii koi kami nahin he phir bhi party ne bhopal se pragna thakur ko maidan main kyon utaara? party ke andruni sutron kaa kahana he ki jis din congress ne digvijay singh kii ummidavaari kii ghoshnaa kii thi, usee samay se rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) jisaki is baar pratyaashiyon ke chayan main saaf taur par bhoomika dikh rahi he, or party adhyaksh amit shah, donon is baat ke liye man bana rahe the ki is baar pragna thakur ko digvijay ke khilaaf maidan main utaara jaae
 a section of the leadership felt that a message behind the elevation of Pragya Thakur against the former Congress chief minister was also to convey that the Congress fielded an 'anti-hindu' leader from this seat, so the BJP reacted to a radical Hinduist face
 Have given
 bhaajapa ke bheetar is drushtikon par gahan charchaa hui kyonki bahut se netaa kai kaarnon se aisa karne ke icchhuk nahin the
 At the same time, a section of BJP leaders felt that while the BJP was strong in Bhopal, Digvijay Singh's candidature should not be taken lightly
 ant main, lagbhag ek maheene ke vichaar-vimarsh ke baad or shivaraj singh chouhan tathaa uma bharti jaise sheersh bhaajapa netaaon ke bhopal se chunaav ladane se inkaar kii vajah se party ne pragna thakur kii ummidavaari kii ghoshnaa kii
 What are the bjp's concerns about fielding Pragya Thakur? BJP insiders say that putting Pragya Thakur in the fray poses a risk of losing a portion of the party's urban vote
 bhaajapa ke ek vidhayak kehete hai, ‘‘jo log bhaajapa ko vikaas ke naam par vot dete hai, unke man main bhaajapa ke ummidavaar kii pasand par sawaal uthe hai
 Those people also cannot vote for the Congress
 aise main ve yaa to vot dene hi nahin jaaenge yaa phir nota chunenge
 Pragya Thakur also lacks organizational experience, has little interaction with BJP workers and leaders in the city and is heavily dependent on the RSS to mobilize voters in his favor
 apni ummidavaari kii ghoshnaa ke ek hafte ke bheetar, matadaataaon ke dhruvikaran ke liye pragna thakur ne ashok chakra puraskaar vijeta ipies adhikari divangat hemanth karkare ke bare main aapattijanak bayaan diya
 He said that due to his curse, Karkare lost his life at the hands of a terrorist
 unke is bayaan par hangaamaa much gaya or rashtrawaad ke agenda kaa jorshor se istemaal karne vaali party baikfoot par aa gai
 But Pragya Thakur could not handle this
 unhone is bayaan ke ek din baad daawa kiya ki babari masjid vidhwans main ve bhi shaamil thim
 The BJP began to smudge and now a veteran spokesperson has a full set of duties
 21 april ko purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne bhi unke saath ek lambii baatcheet kii, jisamen unhen loksabhaa chunaav ladane se judi pechidagiyon ke bare main samajhaayaa gaya
 Even after a week, Team Pragya Thakur has no agenda or document for the development of Bhopal
 jaahir he, yah unki sarvocch praathamikta main nahin he
 However, there is a section of the party leadership who believes that Pragya Thakur will polarize Hindu votes in favor of BJP in rural areas of the constituency
 mulat: jin logon ke liye vot daalate samay dharm sabase bada kaarak hota he, aise shahari or gramin donon hi kshetron ke matadaataaon main pragna thakur kii ummidavaari se bada utsaah he
 The rural vote of Sehore, Berasia and Huzur assembly constituencies under Bhopal Lok Sabha is about 30 percent of total 21 lakh votes of Bhopal
 unhone shanivaar ko bhopal main party kaaryakartaaon se kaha, ‘‘modi ji ne yah sandesh diya he ki bhagava ko sammaan dene kii aavashyaktaa he
 This is not just an election but a crusade
 ’’pragna thakur ne 23 april ko bhopal se apana namakan daakhil kiya or uske das minute baad hi party ke dammi pratyaashee ke taur par vartmaan saansad alok sanger ne parchaa bhar diya
 It is being told that the party's backup plan
 vajahah pragna thakur ko chunaav ayog ne do notice die hai or chunaav aachaar samhita ke ulanghan ke sambandh main unke khilaaf ek exiar darj karai gai he
 Because of this, his candidature has come under suspicion
 duusari ore, enie adaalat ne pragna thakur ko chunaav ladane se rokane kii yachika ko khaarij kar diya,mote taur par pragna thakur kii ranneeti muslim voton ke dhruvikaran kaa muqabla karne ke liye hindu voton ke dhruvikaran kii lagati he
 The BJP hoped that this would happen with the arrival of Digvijay Singh as the Congress candidate
 yah dekhte hue ki unke pratyaashee ke paas vikaas kaa koi khaakaa nahin he, bhaajapa netaa khud ko vikaas ke naam par vot maangane kii sthiti main nahin paa rahe
 This is becoming ironic for BJP
 bhaajapa kaa aisa pratyaashee jiskaa saarvajanik jivan kaa anubhav hota or jo kam kattarpanthi prishthbhumi vaala hota, vah digvijay singh ke khilaaf bhaajapa ke donon hathiyaaron kaa bharpoor istemaal kar paata
 Firstly, the anti-development image of the BJP which Digvijay Singh has created in 15 years, as well as the latest image of Digvijay as a person who is anti-hindu and unrestrained
 ye donon baaten is ladaai kaa palada bhaajapa kii ore jhukaane ke liye paryaapt hotin
 Uma Bharti, while leading the attack against Digvijay Singh in 2003, termed him as a failure to solve basic development issues like electricity, roads and water
 logon ko yah baat jam gai or bhaajapa ko abhootpurv janadesh mila lekin vidambnaa yah he ki congress ab vikaas kii baat kar rahi he jabaki bhaajapa dharm kii bhashaa bolti he
 What is Digvijay Singh's strategy in these changed circumstances? The former Chief Minister has returned to the electoral arena after a long gap of nearly 19 years
 pehali cheez to ve pragna thakur kii ore se uthaae gaye kisi bhi mudde par koi pratikriya nahin de rahe hai or apane swabhaav ke vipareet maun hai
 He does not want to get involved in any chakravyuha of the opposition so he refused to comment on the statements made by Pragya Thakur on Karkare and Babri Masjid
 chunaav abhiyaan ke apane shuruaati dinon main unhone karmchaariyon se maafee maangi, jo shahar kaa ek bada vot bank rahaa he
 He released a fancy vision document for Bhopal on 21 April, presenting a power point presentation that talks about the city's local problems
 is tarah ve yah jataane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki jahaan tak vikaas ke agenda kaa sawaal he, ve bhaajapa se milon aage hai
 Team Digvijay Singh has been working behind the scenes with various social and economic groups, industrial organizations, students and communities, in which Digvijay Singh himself has met at least three dozen such groups
 unki prachaar team kaa hissaa rahe aruneshwar singhdev digvijay singh ke votaron ke saath vyaktigat taur par puraane judaav kii baat par jor dete hue kehete hai, ‘‘raajnneeti main koi bhi aisa vyakti nahin he jisane akele itane adhik logon kii madad kii ho
 Digvijay also has enough religious affiliations to woo such voters who want him to be led by a Hindu leader
 digvijay ke adhikansh daure mandir kii yatraaon se shuru hote hai or 19 april ko hanuman janmotsav ke avasar par unhone ek darjan se adhik mandiron me darshan kiye, ek goshaala main gaayon ko chaara daalkar goseva kii
 However, he says in front of the media, "my Hinduism is my faith
 maine kabhi bhi apane dharmik kaaryon kaa prachaar nahin kiya he, chaahe vah narmada parikrama ho, govardhan parikrama ho yaa phir pangarpur yatra
 The Hindutva of the Sangh does not bring unity among the people, but divides it
 main rajnatik laabh ke liye apane dharm kaa haran kabhi nahin hone duungaa
 "the network of his old comrades has become active and a team of Digvijay Singh's school, Daily College, Indore is also camping in Bhopal for elections
" narmada parikrama main unke sahyatri rahe logon main se lagbhag 300 vyakti unke liye ghar-ghar jaakar prachaar bhi kar rahe hai
 The Bhopal Lok Sabha constituency consists of eight assembly constituencies, out of which the Congress is currently occupied by Bhopal south-west, Bhopal Central and Bhopal North, and the Berasia, Sehore, Huzur, Narela and Govindpura are with the BJP
 digvijay singh ke bhaajapa ke teen vidhayakon krishna gaur, vishwaas saarang or sudesh raay ke saath nijee sambandh bahut madhur hai or aisi sambhaavna he ki unhen apane nijee sambandhon kaa phayda milegaa
 Also, none of these were consulted or negotiated before deciding to field Pragya Thakur from Bhopal
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki bhaajapa ke ye vidhayak pragna thakur ko lekar bahut utsahit nahin dikhte
 Around 4 in Bhopal
 5 lakh muslim matadaata hai or unka vot kisko jayega, iske akalan ke liye bahut dimag lagane kii jarurat nahin he
 In addition, about 1
 75 lakh anusuchit jati ke vot hai
 The Congress hopes that a large part of it will fall into its bag
 bhopal kaa chunaav kai lihaaj se charchaa kaa vishay he
 For BJP, the result of this seat will set its core agenda and provide opportunity for opponents to ponder whether the country now has a permanent inclination towards right
 bhopal ke logon ke liye is chunaav main haar-jeet kaa arth itnaa bhar he: puraane bhopal kii saajha samskruti jeetegi yaa phir nayaa bhopal jisamen saamudayik aadhaar par vibhaajan saaf dikhataa he?bhopal loksabhaa kshetra kii aath vidhansabha siton main se teen congress or paanch bhaajapa ke paas hai
 Digvijay Singh has personal connections with three of these BJP mlas, whose benefits are sure to be met

 Azam's stature itself was reduced to Rampur
 lekin jab donon saath aa gaye to sapa ko 2012 main vah janadesh mila jiske liye mulaayam singh jivan bhar tarasate rahe

 The issue of removing the German language as an alternative to Sanskrit as the third language in Kendriya Vidyalayas in India was raised by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi

 During a meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit, Merkel raised the issue with Modi and invited him to visit Germany
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa saiyad akbaruddin ne kaha, mercel ne bhartiya skulon main sanskrit ke vikalp ke rup main german bhashaa padhaaye jane ke mudde ko uthaaya
 He requested the Prime Minister to consider it and see what the best way forward could be
 pravaktaa ke mutabik, pradhanmantri ne unhen bharosa dilaayaa ki vah khud bharat main bacchon ke anya bhashaaen seekhney ke samarthak hai
 He said that we will work on what can be the best in the realm of the Indian system
 bharat main germany ke rajdoot maaikel steenar bhi bharat sarkaar ke saath is mudde ko uthaa chuke hai or vyaavhaarik samaadhaan kii ummid jataa chuke hai
 The Ministry of Human Resource Development decided to remove the German language as an alternative to Sanskrit, after which around 70,000 children in classes VI to VIII in about 500 central schools could be asked to read Sanskrit instead of German
 saal 2011 main kendriya vidyalayon or goyathe institute-maiks mular bhawan ke bich emoyu hua tha, jisamen german ko teesri bhashaa banaaya gaya tha
 Union Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani defended the government's move, saying the current system is a violation of the three-language formula

 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne hindu samaaj menkaayam jatvaad, chuaachhut ke khilaaf muhim chalaane kaa faisla kiya he
 Sangh's new campaign is certainly good to hear, but how will it be transformed into reality, this big question has arisen
 sangh kii muhim ke saamne chunautiyaan:1
 Hindu society has been entrenched in the ethnic system for centuries
 logon ko apana dharm badalane kii aazaadee to he, magar koi apni jati chunanaa chaahe to naammumkin he
 If someone is a Rajput or a baniya and wants to become a Brahmin, it is not possible
 kisi bhi jati kaa hone ke liye us jati main paidaa hona jaruri hota he
 What concrete steps will the Sangh take to end this system and who will listen to this question is bound to arise? 2
 bataaya gaya he ki sangh kaa iraadaa jati ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav ko khatm kar hindu dharm main aasthaa rakhane vaale sabhi logon ko ekajute karnaa he
 At the same time, the Sangh plans to bring those who have accepted any other religion back again to the realm of Hinduism
 to is kathith ghar vaapasi kii sthiti kisi ko koun si jati main rakhaa jayega ye saaf nahin he jo sangh ke liye ek badi chunauti he
 3
 jab jatiyon ke aadhaar par raajnneeti hoti ho, chunaavon main tikat baante jate hon phir jaateey vyavastha khatm hone kii kaise ummid kii jaae
 During the elections, the Allahabad High Court banned the caste conventions of political parties in UP
 tab itnaa jarur hua ki jatiyon ke naam se kaarykram saarvajanik taur par band ho gaye
 The question is, what measures will the Sangh take to deal with it and how effective will it be? 4
 kuch log maanate hai jati-vyavastha tabhi khatm ho paaegi jab alag-alag jatiyon ke bich sambandh banenge
 a sense of equality and respect will be born between them
 mandal ayog kii siforeeshon ko bhi kuch log mile kaa pathar maanate the par kya uske said effect kabhi koi bhul paaegaa
 The picture of how the Sangh will move in this direction is not clear yet
 5
 The Sangh has decided to move forward on the concept of 'a well, a temple and a cremation ground' for all Hindus
 is project ke liye teen saal kaa vakt tay kiya gaya he
 If there is even a small achievement in this direction in three years, it will be big
 sangh ko isi baat kaa yakeen dilaanaa hoga jo kisi bhi tareeke se aasaan nahin he
 Polarization on religious grounds is possible for politics, but organizing the Hindu society has been the most challenging task for the Sangh
 jaateey aadhaar par hindu samaaj is kadar bikharaa padaa he ki use ekajute karnaa mushkil hi nahin naammumkin jaisaa lagata he
 With this initiative, the late arrival of the Sangh will not be important, provided that it comes properly
