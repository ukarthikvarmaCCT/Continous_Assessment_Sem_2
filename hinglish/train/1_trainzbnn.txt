bank ke andar ek soochna pattee par likhaa he ki shanivaar ko loker room subah das baje se dopaher ek baje tak khulata he
 The rest of the day from ten in the morning to four in the evening
 jaahir he ravivaar ko bank kii chuttee hoti he
 That is, the robbers had time from Saturday evening to Monday morning to clear their hands on the bank locker
 or unhone isi vakt kaa phayda uthaaya
 Like every bank, to get a locker in this bank, it was necessary to open an account in the bank or to get an FD of Rs 10,000
 shanivaar half de or ravivaar kii chuttee ke baad somvaar ko jab bank khulaa to andar to sab kuch thik thaak tha
 But as soon as the manager of the bank reached the store room where the locker and the strong room of the bank were, its winds blew
 andar aadhe ke kareeb loker khule pade the
 There was luggage scattered on the floor
 or thik loker kii diwaar ke saath neeche farsh par ek bada sa gaddha tha
 It was nothing but the same tunnel through which the robbers entered the bank
 bank manager devendra malik ne police ko isaki soochna di
 The police team somehow got inside the tunnel
 surang ke andar ghupp andhera tha
 After this, after a distance of about 100 feet, the police team found the second end of the tunnel
 surang kaa munh kahin or nahin balki bank ke bain taraf gali paar kar band pade is makaan main khulaa tha
 This house has been empty for a long time
 makaan maalik sonipat ke baahar rahata he
 Robbers to dig the tunnel had entered the way of this window inside the house
 jis ghar se surang khodi gai vahaan se punjab neshnal bank ke loker room tak kaa faasla tay karne main kul 57 second kaa vakt lagata he
 But it took the robbers about a month to complete this gap through the tunnel
 jaahir he taiyaari or planning main bhi vakt laga hoga
 That is why again and again the question arises that behind the biggest bank Robbery there is no involvement of the bank itself? According to the bank staff, the place where there is a locker room, there is a strong room of the bank in which the cash of the bank Is kept
 lut ke vakt bhi strong room main lakhon ke cash the
 But the robbers might not break the strong room, so the bank's cash was saved
 jaahir he agar luteron kii planning sateek thi to bank kii laaparvaahee bhi kam nahin thi
 According to RBI rules, the bank does not pay any damages in case of loss or theft of goods kept in the locker
 iske peeche tark ye he ki bank ko isaki jaankaree nahin hoti ki kisne bank ke loker main kya rakhaa he? aise main harjaana kis aadhaar par diya jaae? magar sawaal ye he ki jab bank ko pataa he ki harjane ko lekar aise niyam hai to phir suraksha ke liye usne arabiai ke niyamon kaa paalan kyon nahin kiya? loker ke kamare kii jaisi hifaazat honi chahie thi, kyon nahin kii?bank kii isi laaparvaahee ke khilaaf bank ke graahakon ne bank ke khilaaf pradarshan kiya
 They demand that due to the negligence of the bank, their entire capital was looted, so they should be compensated
 philhal police kii ek khaas team maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 In this connection, the role of the bank's staff, the locker owner and everyone else is being investigated
 police kaa maananaa he ki haryana kii is sabase badi bank robery main jo bhi shaamil hai unka is bank se koi naa koi vaasta jarur he

 Traffic rules have changed in the country, now a strong fine is being charged under the new rule for violating the rules
 gujarat ke surat shahar se aisi tasviren saamne ai hai, jinhen trephic niyamon ke prati jaagarukta kaha jaae yaa phir nae trephic niyamon kaa dar kaha jaae
 Actually, people were seen performing aarti wearing helmets in Lord Ganesha's pandal
 surat ke vesu ilaake main sthit nandani-1 main anya ganesh pandalon kii tarah hi bhagwaan ganesh kii vidaai ke liye aarti kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha lekin aarti main shaamil hone vaale zyaadaatar bhakt helmet pahanakar pahunche
 a lady named Kusum Kothari who reached Bappa's Aarti said that by wearing a helmet, she wants to send a message through Lord Ganesha's Aarti that everyone should wear a helmet
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne jo badlaav kiye hai wo suraksha ke liye hi hai
 Read- a country has four challan rates, there is also traffic police in many states
 Confuse, the woman named Rekha Garg who arrived wearing a helmet in Ganesh pandal says that people should use helmets, our aim is to make society aware
 iske liye bappa se prarthana karte hai
 However, there is a lot of difference between giving a social message and following the traffic rules itself
 aise main kaha ja rahaa he ki logon ke man main kahin naa kahin chaalaan kaa dar he, jo bappa ko vidaai dene ke liye bhi yatayaat ke niyam kaa paalan karte hue helmet pahanakar bhagwaan ko vidaai dene pahunche

 However, till now the CBI has not made any recommendation to the Haryana government to take action on the Gurgaon Police
 lekin apni chargeshit main sibiai ne gudgaanv police kii jamkar fajihat kii he
 After the filing of the CBI charge sheet in the court, the police commissioner of Gurgaon, Sundeep Khirwar is seen hiding his flaws
 police kamishnar ne mana he ki chaatr kii hatya ke maamle main police se kahin na kahin chook hui he
 And in such a situation, action will be taken only after the recommissioning of CBI

 The charge sheet was prepared by Ashok against the police
 lekin sibiai ne police kii theory ko jhootha qaraar de diya he or bas conductor ko nirdosh sabit kar diya
 In such a situation, the CP Sahib is also changing his statement but the question is why the CP Sahib is refusing to act on those policemen
 kya is maamle main police kamishnar kii bhoomika bhi andeh ke ghere main he

 One seat went to the account of independents
 dekhnaa hoga ki is baar gurudwara cameti par kabja kiskaa hota he, kyonki dilli waalon kii najar main ye chunaav mini punjab se kam nahin honge

 He said, 'there is no need to say anything aggressively
 aap ise pyaar se bhi kah sakate hai
 Many people will be with you

" desh ke yuvakon ke liye meraa sandesh he ki yahaan ke yuvaaon main jo pratibha or kshamtaayen hai ve kahin or nahin hai
 Rahul Gandhi said that due to the progress that the country has made since independence, there are many rich people in India today
 50 se 70 saal pehle yahaan ek bhi dhani insaan nahin tha
 Only the Maharaja and the British were rich
 rahul ne kaha, 'meri soch bharat main nirbhik bharatiyon kii he
 This is how i want to build India
 unhone kaha, bharat duniya main sarvaadhik pratibhashali raashtra he
 Use this talent and bring humility to your attitude and respect each other

 It must have happened to you that you have touched your partner with love and it has flared up on you or something that you have proved wrong by taking their excitement and your fun The plan has stopped agar haa, to aisa dobaaraa na ho isliye kuch baton kii ganth baandh len
 And what are those things that we tell you
 ankhiyaan mila ke
 
 
 Hold your partner's hand, look into their eyes for a while
 agar vah apni palake saamaanya se zyada yani ek minute main 15 baar se zyada jhapakaati hai, to samaj jaaie ki mohatarama kaa mood ban rahaa he
 During this, maintain complete confidence in your face
 is se un ke hormones main badlaav hoga, jis ke chalate vah aap ke prati arkshit hoti hai
 Take music with you
 
 
 purush or mahila donon ke gosipping ke mudde alag alag hote hai
 It is also often seen that when a woman gets excited or drunk by the touch of a man, the man becomes demoralized
 apane bheetar ke sankoch ko dur karne or apane saathi ko puri tarah santusht karne ke liye aap party kaa maahaul bhi bana sakate hai
 So why not opt for some DJ music system and make fun of the madness of drunkenness
 pie doguna vaapasajab vah charmotkarsh kii taraf bad rahi hon, to unki qamar ko apane donon haathon main pakad kar unhen puri tarah anand lene ke liye chod den, lekin haa, apana role nibhaate rahen
 If during this time you continue to satisfy your partner, then surely she will return to you with the same happiness
 jaankaree hi bachaatpane saathi ke masik dharm ke bare main puri jaankaree rakhen, taaki aap ko yah baat pataa ho ki unhen kab akele chhodana he
 But you can also benefit from this
 jab un ke masik dharm hone main kuch samay bachaa ho, to vah behad uttejk swabhaav main ho sakati hai
 The enjoyment of physical relationships in this time will be very memorable
 lekin is baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki is dauraan vah garbhadhaaran bhi bahut jaldi kar sakati hai
 You can enjoy better food, better relatives by giving breakfast at bed
 subah ke naashte main unhen vah chijen den, jo unhen behad pasand hai
 If desired, you can also give banana shake to make the morning colorful
 90 fisadi swaad khaane kii sugandh main hota he
 And the better aroma blood pressure is faster, which makes your partner connect with you more quickly
 jaraa dhyaan se dekhenforple ke dauraan aap kii partner ko dhyaan se dekhen
 During the foreplay, the breast of women is spread up to 25%
 to yah bhi ek acha sin he yah pataa lagane kaa ki aapke sparsh se vah kitni uttejit ho rahi hai
 Light pink marks may emerge on their chests
 aisa isliye hota he kyonki forple ke dauraan bladpressure or blad cirkulation bad jaataa he
 Just think that without knowing them, you will know which of your things are pleasing to them
 masti or majaa, mood dekh kar
 
 
 It is also good to have fun, but it should be well known to you that at which time you can have fun
 unke man kii baat kaa pataa aap ko un kaa pet de saktaa he
 Pay attention to your partner's stomach movements
 baaten karte hue dekhen agar saans lete samay vah pet ko bheetar kii taraf khinch rahi hai, to yakeenan vah tanaav main hai or is vakt un ke saath maskhri karnaa sahi nahin he
 But if she is releasing her stomach while breathing, it means that she is feeling very relaxed and she can laugh at your useless jokes even with a laugh
 or garmi chaa javogar aap ko apane saathi ke haath hameshaa thande lagate hai, to isaki vajah yah he ki mahilaon kaa sharir baahar se garam hone ke baje bheetar se garam hota he
 To warm them, rotate your hands around their waist
 is se vah khud ko hot mahasoos karengi
 And after that you already know what to do
 bhaanpe utsukata kaapane saathi kii anguliyon par dhyaan den
 a woman's fingers are the most trusted part of her body to express her eagerness
 agar vah nakhun chabane jaisi koi harakat kar rahi hon, to unhen roke nahin
 By doing so, she can connect with you more deeply
 un ke haathon ko sahjaat se apane haathon main lete hue unhen gale se laga len
 Then see how much love falls on you

 So sir, you desperately need to be recharged

 unhen bahut acha lagata he agar koi unki fitness kii tarif kare
 So it is a good point for you, which you can take advantage of
 lekin agar vah figure kanshyas nahin hai or thodi moti hai, to unke figure ke bajaae sharir ke ubhaaron kii tarif karen
 This will not make them feel awkward and will become your job as well
 is ke sathe hi apane saathi ko bataaen ki uske hont kitne sundar hai
 Talk about the color and shape of their lips
 haa, unke khaas feechar kaa zikr karnaa na bhoolen
 Do not tie yourself to any limits
 jhijak ko pare rakh den or khul kar unki tarif karen
 Give importance to every part of them

 unamem se kuch sawaalon ke jawaab to police ko talashne hai taaki mujalim ko sajaa dilaai ja sake, lekin tamaam sawaal aam logon ke jahan main hai
 The biggest question among them is that in order to get separated from his wife, what was the necessity of getting him stabbed and slaughtered 14 times, he could even divorce her, but there are many things in the human mind which are not so easy to understand
 har kisi kii koshish hoti he ki saal kaa pehla kaam acha ho, dilli sarkaar ne bhi dilliwaalon ko ditisi bason ke kiraaye main raahat dekar saal kii acchhee or rahatbhari shuruyaat karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 The promise was that from the very first day of the new year, the fare in DTC buses would be only five rupees
 yahi nahin, asi bas main safar karne par kiraaya das rupye hoga, chaahe kitni bhi duuri tak safar kar len
 But the first day of the year passed and the second day too, but these two days of the new year could not give relief
 nae saal main jab log ditisi kii bason main savaar hue, toconductorke paas pahunchate hi raahat noummidi main badal gai
 Because the fare in DTC buses is still being charged as before
 is baat ko lekar kai bason main to yatriyon or conduktaron ke bich kahasuni kii khabaren bhi hai
 Till date, reporters also boarded a DTC bus to know the reality of the government's promise
 goldackhanese bas main chadhe or sidhe conductor ke paas pahunch gaye
 When asked the question, the answer was the same as the passengers were getting, they did not have any official information about reducing the fare or taking only five rupees
 conductor ne bataaya ki akhabaaron main unhone bhi padhaa tha ki ek janvari se kiraaya sirf paanch rupee hoga, lekin unhen is baavat koi nirdesh ditisi prabandhan kii taraf se nahin mila he
 The conductor said that it has now come to his ears that perhaps from January 10 this scheme will be implemented, but he did not have any official information
 yahi haal sabhi yatriyon kaa he, bas main safar kar rahemohanlalane bataaya ki subah jab wo bas main savaar hue the, to unhone conductor se poocha tha lekin paanch rupee vaali yojana ke bare main uske inkaar ke baad unhone apane stop ke hisaab se das rupee kaa tikat liya
 The same situation took place in dtc's Scindia House office, where different passes are made for DTC buses
 haalanki sarkaar kii taraf se koi spashtikaran nahin aayaa, lekin anaupchaarik charchaa main ditisi ke afasaron ne bataaya ki philhal takneekee vajahon or asamanjas kii vajah se flats kiraaye kii file atak gai he
 However, according to sources, the government is currently going to implement the scheme in night service
 bataaya ye bhi ja rahaa he ki parivahan mantri shahar se baahar the or ab lautne ke baad wo is bare main jaldi hi koi faisla le sakate hai

 An internal note by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has surfaced on the social networking site Twitter in which it has been justified to tax the pension of the military forces

 In the note that appeared on Twitter, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said that 'some unscrupulous employees have exploited the system tremendously who have received government benefits to disabled soldiers

 One official said, 'we must have an effective system to catch the corrupt

 Many retired army officers are criticizing the government's decision on Twitter

 The police team, however, tried to arrest the devotees (sabarimala Temple), who blocked the traditional forest path and blocked the way for women from the 'manithi' organization in Chennai

 aise main party uparajyapal se baat karke 28 vidhayakon ke saath alpamat main hi sarkaar banane par vichaar kar rahi he
 In fact, it is believed that the aap's formula for forming the government is that it can send the message to the public that the BJP could not dare to form the government even after winning 32 seats and the AAP formed the government despite winning 28 seats and Later, if the BJP or the Congress tries to topple any government, the fine should be blamed directly on that party

 bijepi apni daayitv se peeche hati he or up-rajyapal ne hamen bulaayaa he to ham charchaa kar rahe hai ki kaise ham sarkaar bana sakate hai
 Well, you are not ready to say anything clearly

 After the Punjab National Bank (PNB) major scam, diamond merchant Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi are absconding from the country

 The answer would be, yes, they can be brought back through the Indian Extradition Act and the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty
 magar kai mushkilen bhi hai
 Let us understand the complexities of the law in five points-1-what is Extradition Treaty According to the Foreign Ministry website, under extradition treaty, any country assigns an accused to another country
 yah tabhi sambhav hota he, jab aaropee kaa aparaadh sabit ho jaae or court use doshi qaraar de de
 a formal application to initiate the process for extradition can be made with a country only in the case of a fugitive criminal
 isamen iskaa dhyaan rakhana hoga ki apradhi kaa aparaadh ukt desh ke saath hue pratyrpan sandhi ke daayre main aata ho
 2-what is the complexity? Before that we have to understand the complexity of the extradition treaty
 pehla-pratyrpan kanoon ke praavdhaan unheen sthitiyon main lagu hote hai, jab aaropee kaa aparaadh donon deshon main aparaadh mana jaataa ho
 Second, in case of financial fraud, the accused can be brought to India from abroad, but for that India will have to go through the court process
 magar yah itnaa aasaan bhi nahin jitna ki samajha ja rahaa he
 Because India's extradition treaty with other countries has not been changed or amended for decades
 3-puraane maamle main pratyrpanabaharhaal aarthik dhokhadhadi ke doshiyon ko desh laane ke maamalon ko udhaaharan ke taur par samajha ja saktaa he
 International fraud Narendra Kumar Rastogi was brought to India in July 2008 through an extradition treaty
 frod karne waalon main vah akele nahin tha, balki uske bhai ravinder, virendra, subhash chand or chachera bhai rakesh bhi shaamil the
 All these brothers together had looted 54 crores rupees to the Government of India during 1989-92
 rastogi bandhu sarkaar kaa paisa lekar dubai, america, britain or singapore bhaag gaye
 In this case, Ravinder was brought to India in 2003 and is currently out on bail
 narendra 2008 main pratyrpit kiya gaya
 Narendra also spent 84 months in a US prison in another case of fraud
 uske baad use bharat laayaa gaya
 Rakesh is still missing
 4-kaise aayega neerav modinirav modi ko bharat laane ke liye kanoonee prakriya se guzarana hoga
 First of all, he will be heard in the court and should be convicted
 doshi qaraar die jane ke baad jaanch agenciyon ko pataa lagaana hoga ki neerav modi kis desh main he or yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki us desh ke saath pratyrpan sandhi kis tarah kii he
 After all these things, the formal process of extradition of Nirav Modi with that country has to be started
 5-do aaropee, ek kanoonbharat kaa abhi tak 43 deshon ke saath pratyrpan sandhi he
 India has just concluded such a treaty with Iran
 bharat kaa britain or america ke saath bhi pratyrpan sandhi he
 Vijay Mallya, an accused in the fraud is living in Britain, which is being tried to bring to India
 haalanki maalya auranirav modike khilaaf lage aarope main thodaa antar he, lekin donon ko ek hi kanoon ke tahat bharat pratyrpit karana hoga
 Sources told India Today that if Nirav is in the country from which the extradition treaty can be brought to India, it is still not easy
 lalakile se piem modi ne kaha ki koi chota nahin hota koi bada nahin hota
 a squirrel also forms part of the process of change
 unhone kaha ki 2022 main samuhik shakti ke dwaara ham parivartan laa sakate hai
 Everyone should get equal opportunities in New India
 yahaan par bharat kaa vishwa main dabadabaa bane
 PM Modi said that we pledge for New India for the next five years

 After paying homage to the martyred soldiers, Army Chief General Bipin Rawat has warned those elements that have been causing bottlenecks in counter-terrorism operations in Kashmir for the past one year
 sena pramukh ne saaf-saaf kaha he ki ab kashmir main iesas or pakistani jhande lahraane waalon ke saath sakhti ke saath nipta jayega
 This simply means that now the army will not refrain from firing on the security forces or those who are protesting against the army, if necessary
 sena pramukh ke bayaan ne kashmir main bavaal bhi khadaa kar diya he
 Many parties have risen to protest against indirect warnings of direct firing on Kashmiris
 sena pramukh ne yah bayaan aise hi nahin diya he
 Whether it was the encounter with the terrorists on Sunday or the encounter on Tuesday, some locals threw stones at the army during the operation
 isse ravivaar ko aatanki bhaag niklaa
 These elements are indirectly helping the terrorists to escape by staging protests and stone pelting at the encounter sites, which is not acceptable to the army at all
 kai baar aisa bhi dekha gaya he ki muthbhed ke dauraan sena par patharav karke sena ke javaanon kaa dhyaan bantane yaa phir unke kaam main roda atakane se sena ke kai jawan maare ja chuke hai
 Not only this, many dangerous terrorists have managed to escape from the circle
 tippaniyan According to information received by NDTV India, on February 12, four terrorists were killed in Nagbal, two soldiers were martyred and three terrorists fled
 aise hi pichley saal 17 may ko kupwada main ek aatanki maaraa gaya tha or sena ke do javaanon ko goli lagi thi
 Four terrorists had escaped

 Some had stones in their hands and some people had wood
 aise saikadon udaarahan hai jab sthaneey logon ne aatankiyon ke khilaaf suraksha balon kii karrwai main baadha paidaa kii
 This is the reason that once again the common people of Jammu and Kashmir have been advised not to go to the places where the security forces are having an encounter with the terrorists
 jaankaar bataate hai ki yah aatankiyon tathaa iequi kii nai ranneeti he jiskaa aadesh unhen seemaa paar se mila he
 Many times when army soldiers are shot dead because of protesters
 badakismati se goli se kisi aam aadmi kii maut ho jaati he to us jagah par maanon ubaal hi aa jaataa he
 Army experts say that now they are fed up with this double front
 javaanon ko dushman par sidhi goli chalaane kaa prashikshan diya jaataa he, lekin agar halaat nahin sudhare to ve kaise apane logon par goli chalaayenge
 This will increase the distance between the common people and the army, which will not be easy to bridge

 enditivi india ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik 12 farvari ko nagbal main chaar aatanki maare gaye, do jawan shahid hue or teen aatanki bhaag gaye
 Similarly, on May 17 last year, a terrorist was killed in Kupwara and two army personnel were shot
 chaar aatanki bhaag gaye the
 In both these places, more than 500 people were seen demonstrating during the terrorist action against the army
 kisi ke haath main pathar tha to kisi ke haath main lakdi
 There are hundreds of examples of this when the local people obstructed the action of the security forces against the terrorists
 yahi vajah he ki ek baar phir se jammu-kashmir ke aam logon ko salaah di gai he ki un jagahon par na jaaen jahaan surakshabalon kii aatankiyon ke saath muthbhed ho rahi ho
 Experts say that this is a new strategy of terrorists and ISI whose orders have been received from across the border
 kai baar aisa hota he jab pradarshnakariyon ke kaaran jaan par ban aati he tab sena ke jawan goli chalaate hai
 Unfortunately, if a common man dies due to bullet, then the place is boiled like that
 sena ke jaankaar bataate hai ki ab ve is dohare morche se tang aa gaye hai
 The soldiers are trained to shoot directly at the enemy, but if the situation does not improve then how will they shoot at their people
 isse aam logon or sena ke bich kii duuri to or bad jaaegi jise paatna aasaan nahin hoga

 There will not be a longer tomb than this tomb in Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh, anyway, when a man digs a tomb, then it measures depth, but here this tomb itself was built
 or wo bhi pahaad main ban rahi ek surang ke 30 meter andar
 Currently, 3 living humans are buried in this tomb for the last 8 days
 ji haa, pichley 8 dinon se is kabr sein teen logonko sahi-salaamat baahar nikaalane kii jaddojahad chal rahi he
 If all three have any means of contact with the outside world, the camera was just crossed through a hole in the wall of debris
 jo in logon kaa haal baahar kii duniya or inke apano tak pahunchaa saktaa he
 These forced humans buried alive in the tomb 30 meters inside the tunnel, through this camera can tell their condition to their family members
 philhal ye teenon shaks chaaron taraf se ek aisi gupha main fanse hai, jiske chaaron taraf pahaad hi pahaad hai
 Alam is that they can neither get out of this cave nor can anyone go inside this cave to know their condition
 tunnel main fanse in mazaduron ke liye ek-ek pal bitaana kitna mushkil ho rahaa he is baat kaa andaja ham shaayad hi laga saken
 Outside, their families are praying for them to come out alive, so inside they too have a desire to meet their family
 philhal is surang main fanse mazdooron kaa hausala badhaane kaa ek hi jariya he wo microphone or wo sisitivi camera jisaki madad se wo apane dil kaa haal baahar baithe adhikariyon ko bataa sakate hai
 To spend a moment on these people imprisoned in this dark tunnel and waiting to get out safely, we and you can only realize this
 ek andheri surang, naa hawa or naa pani, or usamen fanse 3 majdoor
 Thinking that the Hiroungtee should be standing, but the truth is that three workers have been stranded in the tunnel on the kiratpur-nerchowk highway in Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh, for the last 8 days
 haalanki andiaref kii team unhen rescue karne kii puri koshish kar rahaa he, lekin sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki kya ye log is kabr se jinda baahar aa paaenge?gauratlab he ki himachal pradesh ke bilaspur main kiratpur-nerchowk forlan haive par panoh ke paas kareeb dedh kilometre lambii surang banane kaa kaam chal rahaa tha
 On the night of September 12, 2015, at around 8
30 pm, the shift of the laborers working in the same under construction tunnel was changing, at that time 16 workers were working inside the tunnel
 abhi in 16 main se 13 log hi baahar aa paae the ki tabhi achaanak tunnel ke andar ek haadasa hua or surang kii 25 feet oonchi chat se achaanak malba gira or wo teenon majdoor, satish kumaar, mani ram or hday ram surang ke andar hi funs gaye
 Let us tell you that the laborers trapped in the Tehra tunnel of Bilaspur in Himachal Pradesh have not been evacuated even after 8 days and 190 hours
 surang main fanse satish or maniram ne 4 din is ghupp andhere main bina khaae pie kaat die
 He could be contacted on the fifth day
 adhikariyon ke mutabik andheri surang main fanse mazdooron ko baahar nikaalane main sakht chattaane rukaawat ban rahi hai
 Not only this, whenever they try to remove the debris in the tunnel, more debris falls from above
 haalanki mazdooron ko nikaalane ke liye bathinda or oona se andiaref timen maukey par maujuud hai
 According to sources, a modern drilling machine has been called from Rajasthan to get the workers out of the tunnel
 jisaki madad se malbe ke aar-paar 30 meter hole kiya ja chukaa he
 According to officials, on Friday, workers trapped in the tunnel were sent food three times a day with the help of a pipe
 iske alaava tunnel main fanse mazdooron kaa haunsala badhaane ke liye sisitivi or microphone ke jariye mazdooron se sampark banaaya hua he
 According to sources, the workers had complained to the authorities about a large crack in the tunnel and they alleged that the officials did not take their complaint seriously
 or uske kuch vakt baad hi ye haadasa ho gaya
 But the biggest question right now is, how will these three fight against death by staying in a dark grave? Will these humans be able to come out alive despite being trapped in the grave for 7 days? Or will this tomb prove to be truly a tomb for these three people? a similar incident took place in a gold mine in Chile a few years ago
 vahaan 33 mazdoor 69 din tak sone kii khadaan main fanse rahe
 But he did not lose courage and finally after 69 days of struggle he was safely taken out of the mine
 ye vaaki kisi karishme se kam nahin tha
 (put shots of happy mine workers, their companions and family members on coming out of the capsule) What is the joy of coming back from the mouth of death? Ask these humans who came out alive after spending 69 days in the tomb
 or puuchhie inke un apano se jo inhen jinda dekhne kii ummid puri tarah se kho chuke the
 It was nothing short of a miracle
 kyonki duniya main aaj tak aisa nahin hua ki jameen kii sataha se dhai hajaar feet neeche
 After being imprisoned for more than two months without air, water and food, 33 humans have come out alive
 magar 33 insaanon kii is toli ne apane jinda rahane ke jazbe or junun se ye sabit kar diya he ki insaan agar chaahe to jindagi kii jang maut ke khilaaf bhi jeet saktaa he
 Actually, on August 5, 2010, thirty-three laborers were trapped under the ground after falling stones in this Chilean gold mine
 chunki khadaan kaa ye hissaa sakht pattharon se pata tha isaliye raahat or bachaav kaary main lage logon ko inase sampark banane main teen hafton kaa vakt lag gaya
 During this time, these mine workers remained locked in a basement built thousands of feet below
 or taintis mazdooron ke liye mahaj do dinon kaa khaanaa
 They lasted for three weeks
 aakhirkaar teen hafton ke baad jab drilling mashin kaa ek sira in mazdooron ke najadik pahunchaa to unhone apane jinda hone kaa sandesh ek kaagaj par likh usee drilling mashin ke jariye waapas jameen tak pahunchaaya
 Then for the first time CCTV cameras and some food items could be delivered to the laborers with the help of a hole inside this mine
 is tarah ek ek kar 69 din guzar gayi or 5 agast ko kabr main dafan hue 33 insaan 12 aktubar kii raat drilling mashin ke jariye khodi gai surang ke raste jinda baahar aana shuru ho gaye
 For the people of Chile
 khaastaur par khadaan mazdooron ke gharavaalon ke liye ye mauka kisi jashn se kam nahin tha
 33 laborers had arrived to extract gold in the gold mine, but suddenly the gold mine collapsed and the path through which they landed was completely closed
 baahar nikalnaa to chhodie baahar kii roshni tak andar nahin aa rahi thi
 The world understood that all the workers were killed
 magar 17 din baad achaanak ek chamatkaar hota he
 In a large bedroom-like place inside the mine, 33 people fought the battle for death for 69 days
 ek choti-si jagah itane log or aise halaat main jahaan ye thik-thik bataanaa bhi mushkil ho ki agle pal kya hoga, or aisi jagah se inkaa baahar nikalnaa kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin
 Well, if this miracle was credited to the spirit of the mine workers
 vaise isamen bachaav dal kii koshishon or gharavaalon kii duaon kaa bhi utana hi haath rahaa
 People outside the mine continued to try to encourage these people by sending letters and by phone
 log khadaan main prarthana kar saken saken iske liye suraakh ke jariye bibil bheji gai
 The Chilean government minister himself was involved in this campaign
 sarkaar ne khadaan main fanse logon ko saaf kaha tha ki unhen akelaa nahin choda jayega
 This is the reason that when the quarry company gave up the rescue operation due to the Kangali, the government itself took over the task
 ji haa, aise mushkil halaat se ladane ke liye jaruri he majboot iraade kaa
 Being strong
 kyonki is haalat main ummid khone kaa matlab tha maut
 However, this mission was not easy either
 lekin phir bhi bachaav dal ne dinaraat apni koshish jari rakhi or aakhirkaar 69 din ke baad sabhi 33 logon ko is khadaan se sahi salaamat baahar nikaal liya gaya tha

 ganguli ne kaha, 'unhone maukey kii najaakat ke mutabik yah baat kar di or yah sahi nahin he
 He was upset with the defeat
 us baat ko vahiin chhod do
 Everyone has to sit and think
 dhoni ko nicha mat dikhaao
 He has a great record in odis

 pichley chaar saal main bahut kuch badal chukaa he or viraat kohli cricket jagat main ballebaaji ke badshaah ban chuke hai, yahi vajah he ki unke bachapan ke coach rajkumaar sharma ko lagata he ki england ke khilaaf ek agast se shuru hone vaali paanch test maichon kii siries main bhartiya captain ke balle ko rokna mushkil hi nahin naammumkin hoga
 When the Indian team went on a tour of England in 2014, Kohli made 13 in ten innings of five matches
 40 kii ausat se keval 134 ran banaae or unka ucchtam score 39 ran rahaa
 This performance becomes overshadowed by Kohli only when the tour of England is mentioned, but Sharma said that this star batsman has forgotten that tour
 england main 4 saal puraani naakaami ko bhul chukaa he viratsharma ne ‘bhashaa’ se saakshaatkaar main kaha, ‘logon ko lagata he ki viraat ko kuch sabit karnaa he, lekin ab viraat ko kuch sabit nahin karnaa he
 He is four years old and he has forgotten it
 uske baad usne kaaphi kuch hasil kiya he or vah puri tarah se badla hua khilaadi ban gaya he
 After that tour of England, Kohli played his batting stint across the world
 unhone bharat ke alaava australia, dakshin africa, westeindies or srilanka main saikade jade
 In fact, 64 of the 37 Test matches Kohli played after the 2014 England tour
 89 kii ausat se 3699 ran banaae jisamen 15 shatak shaamil hai
 The English cricketer wants to take inspiration from Kohli in the Test series, which was overshadowed by Anderson on England's tour of India, Dronacharya Award winner Sharma, who taught cricket to Kohli Kohli, said, 'now there is no pressure on him and he can prove anything to anyone
 Don't have to
 vah bahut sakaaratmak soch ke saath is siries main utar rahaa he
 a series is the worst of any player
 uske baad to viraat ne bahut hi behtareen pradarshan kiya he
 The current series is expected to be an interesting match between Kohli and James Anderson
 england ke pichley daure main anderson ne chaar baar kohli ko pavilion kii raah dikhaai thi, lekin iske baad 2016 main jab england kii team bhartiya daure par ai to kohli ke saamne anderson puri tarah se naakaam rahe or bhartiya captain ko ek baar bhi out nahin kar paae
 Kohli 109 in five matches of this series
 16 kii ausat se 655 ran banaae the jisamen do shatak bhi shaamil the
 Sharma said that Anderson is not under pressure from Kohli
 sharma ne kaha, ‘kohli abhi anderson kaa saamana karne ke liye puri tarah se taiyaar hai
 When Anderson came on the Indian tour, Kohli batted brilliantly against him
 unhone mumbai main doharaa shatak bhi banaaya tha
 i was watching that match and he was comfortable facing Anderson
 nisandeh anderson behtareen gendbaaj he, lekin viraat par kisi tarah kaa dabaav nahin he
 He is not thinking of Anderson
 ’is yuva ballebaaj ne bataaya, kamyaabi ke liye dhoni ne kya di thi seekhengland main siries jeetna kohli kaa lakshyakohli kaa lakshya asal main england main siries jeetne par laga he
 India won the last series in England under Rahul Dravid in 2007
 iske baad 2011 or 2014 main use haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Sharma said, "virat is more focused on the team's victory than his own performance
" us par ran banane kaa dabaav nahin he balki vah chahta he ki team siries jite
 Former Ranji cricketer Sharma believes that if the top order succeeds in giving a good start, then India's chances of winning will increase
 unhone kaha, ‘dabaav nishchit taur par sheersh kram par he
 If (murali) Vijay and (shikhar) Dhawan succeed in giving a good start and our middle order does not get to face the new ball then India has a very good possibility
 hamaari salaami bhagidaari behad mahatvapurn hogi
 Sharma said, "it is the job of specialist batsmen to play the new ball
" use openar hi acchhee tarah se khelte hai
 It would be better if the middle order batsmen do not face the new ball

 This petition was filed by Rajendra Thakur of Satiraje village in Alibag
 rajendra thakur ne apni yachika main kaha tha ki alibagh ko prakritik sundarataa ke saath prakruti ne nawaja he

 Thakur had requested the court to direct the state authorities to refrain from using this saying
 unhone court se yah sunishchit karne kaa bhi aagrah kiya tha ki filmein, tivi dharawahik aadi, jisamen is kahawat ko istemaal kiya gaya he, unhen sensor board certificate na de

 bataa den ki congress ke ummidavaar utaare jane se west upi main muqabla trikoniya ho gaya he, yahi kaaran he ki mahagathbandhan ke nishane par congress lagaataar bani hui he
 Even before this, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra did a road show for the Congress candidate in Ghaziabad
 gajiabad se congress kii doli sharma pratyaashee hai, jinka muqabla bhartiya janata party ke general wike singh se he
 Significantly, Rahul has been taking a soft stand against the Grand Alliance so far, saying that his fight is with the BJP and the alliance fight is also against the BJP

 It is said that every wish asked here is fulfilled and before starting any work, if the blessings of Balaji of Ghat are taken, then the success of that work is completely guaranteed
 jaipur raaje rajavaadon kaa shahar he, jahaan kii sundarataa ko dekhakar man mohit hue bina rah nahin paata
 And in the morning when the golden rays of the sun fall on this pink city, it seems as if the whole city has taken a bath in gold water

 ' BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, who made a controversial statement about the film star Shah Rukh Khan, may have withdrawn his remarks on Twitter, apologizing in this regard, but there is no shortage of his aggressive attitude
 bijepi netaa ne guuruuvaar ko apane taaja bayaan main bina kisi kaa naam liye kaha ki jo koi bhi desh kaa sammaan kam karne kii koshish karegaa, use bakhsha nahin jayega

 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The Congress has released its manifesto for the 2019 elections and has made several big promises ranging from the minimum income scheme for voters to a separate farmers budget
 congress ne kaha he ki vah satta main aate hi khaali sarkari naukariyon ko bharegi, sabko swasthya kaa haq muhaiyaa karegi, jiesti ko saral banaaegi or shiksha par kharch badhayegi
 But to fulfill all these promises, the economy will have to pay a heavy price
 har saal kul milakar kam se kam salanaa 10 lakh karod rupee kaa atirikt kharch hoga
 Let us know how much burden will be incurred on the treasury in implementing the declaration of Congress
 nunatam aay yojana (nyay)yah congress kii sabase mahatvakankshi or sabase kharchili yojana bhi he
 Under this, 20% of the country's poor have to ensure an income of Rs 72,000 annually
 is par salanaa 3
 It will cost 6 lakh crore rupees
 pehle saal main is par sakal gharelu utpaada (GDP) kaa 1 fisadi or duusare saal main jidipi kaa kareeb 2 fisadi kharch hoga
 Increasing education spending by 6% of GDP on education is a good move
 yah paisa khaskar buniyadi dhaanche ke nirmaan or teachers ke vetan par kharch hoga
 Currently 4 of GDP
 6 fisadi tak shiksha par kharch hota he
 8 this year
 76 lakh karod rupee hota he
 2 to fulfill Rahul Gandhi's promise
 66 lakh karod salanaa kharch badhanaa hoga yani shiksha par salanaa kul 11
 4 lakh crore rupees will have to be spent
 health par kharch badhaakar GDP ke 3 fisadi tak karnacongress saal 2023-24 tak desh main swasthya par hone vaala kharch badhaakar jidipi ke 3 fisadi tak karne kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 This would be more than two times the current budget on healthcare
 niti ayog ke mutabik swasthya par maujuuda kharch jidipi ke 1
 3 per cent, which is around 2
 47 lakh karod rupee hota he
 The Congress wants to provide free medical care to all citizens
 iske liye sarkari aspataalon or praathmik evam dwitiyak str ke ilaaj dhaanche kaa vistaar karnaa hoga
 Overall expenditure on health increased by 5 from them
 71 lakh karod rupee ho saktaa he, jo maujuuda bajet se 3
 23 lakh crore more
 khaali sarkari padon ko bharnacongress ne 4 lakh sarkari padon ko march 2020 tak bharne kaa apane menifesto main vaada kiya he
 Similarly, another 20 lakh vacancy will be filled by the state governments
 iske alaava gram panchayaton main 10 lakh seva mitron kii bhartee kii jaaegi
 The minimum salary of a central government employee is Rs 18,000, which is 2 per year
 16 lakh rupee kaa package hota he
 So filling 4 lakh vacant posts of the central government means a burden of at least Rs 8,640 crore annually on the exchequer
 iske alaava rajya sarkaron kii naukariyon se unke khajaane par atirikt boj padegaa
 Every year a huge amount is spent, thus the Congress manifesto will put an additional burden of about Rs 10 lakh crore annually on the budget of the Central Government
 yah dekhte hue ki bharat kaa is saal kaa kul bajet hi kareeb 27
 84 lakh crores, the burden of 10 lakh crores can be said to be too much
 bharat sarkaar kii kamai main salanaa 12 se 14 fisadi badhat kii ummid lagaaein to saal 2023-24 tak bhi yah badhkar mahaj 45 lakh karod rupee kaa hoga
 How Congress will make such a huge expenditure possible, it is still in the future
