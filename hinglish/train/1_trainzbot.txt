 The results and trends of the Bihar Assembly Elections 2010 have outlined four main facts: Firstly, the public support given to the JDU-BJP alliance has shown that the people of Bihar have now risen above caste considerations
 
 janata ne sushasan ke paksh main vot diya he, jo ki lalu prasad ke 15 saal ke kaarykaal main dekhne ko nahin mila tha
 As a result, the lalu-paswan duo could not succeed despite the muslim-yadav alliance
 pehle aisi atkal lagaai ja rahi thi ki bihar ke yadav bahul ilaakon main jediu kaa pradarshan kharaab rahegaa, lekin matganana ke baad yah ashanka bhi puri tarah nirmul sabit hui
 In 50 such constituencies, the participation of Muslims was more than 20 percent during the voting
 jediu kii sahyogi party bijepi thi, iske baavjood musalamaanon ne nitish ke paksh main hi vot daalaa or gathbandhan ko behtareen kamyaabi hasil hui
 The other thing to note in this election is that BJP has emerged vigorously in Bihar
 varsh 2005 ke chunaav main bijepi 54 siton par kabiz thi, jabaki is baar yah 80 se zyada siton par jeet hasil karne ja rahi he
 However, this has happened due to the charisma of Nitish Kumar
 iskaa yah arth katai nahin nikaala ja saktaa ki bihar kii janata pehle se zyada sampradayik ho gai he
 Thirdly, in many constituencies, the percentage of women voting was 10 per cent more than the turnout of men
 mahilaon kii unnati ko dhyaan main rakhkar taiyaar kii gai sarkari yojanaon ne bhi jediu ko kamyaabi dilaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 50% reservation for women in Panchayati Raj Institutions and Municipal bodies, 50% reservation for women in primary school recruitment, Chief Minister Balika Cycle Yojana etc
 are prominent among them
 cycle yojana ke tahat nauveen va isse upar kii kaksha main padhane vaali ladakiyon ko cycle ke liye 2000 rupee kaa anudaan diya jaataa he
 Lastly, the situation in Congress has been worse than in 2005
 pehle charan ke chunaav ke baad is tarah kii afvaah faili ki lalu prasad kii party chunaav main acha pradarshan karne ja rahi he
 This inspired even more voters to vote in favor of a coalition led by the Nitish Kumar, an adamant caste voter
 nitish kumaar ne ek behatar bhoomi sudhaar kanoon ko waapas le liya tha
 It is clear that even the magic of Rahul Gandhi could not work this time
 sach kaha jaae to congress ke haath niraashaa hi ai he, jabaki rahul ke alaava sonia gandhi ne bhi chunaav-prachaar main bhagidaari kii thi
 Yasir Usman has written a book on the evergreen Bollywood actress Rekha titled 'rekha: An Untold Story'

 The camera continued to roll and the director did not say cut
 unit ke sadsy sitiyaan maar rahe the
 Rekha had closed her eyes and there were only tears in these closed eyes
 is seen ke bare main rekha ko koi jaankaree nahin thi or baad main jab rekha ne is cheez ke liye aawaaj uthaane kii sochi to kisi bure anjaam ke dar se unhone chup rahane kaa faisla kiya
 Apart from this, many such stories are mentioned in this book when Rekha came into the can
 inhen main se ek he vinod mehara se shaadi kaa kissa
 When Rekha and Vinod returned to Mumbai after getting married in Kolkata, the newly wedded bride was welcomed with slippers
 ji haa, vinod kii maa yani rekha kii saaskamalaais shaadi ko lekar behad naaraaz thim
 As soon as Rekha bowed down to seek blessings, her mother-in-law immediately pushed her
 itnaa hi nahin, kamala gusse main itani aag babula ho gayi ki unhone rekha ko maarane ke liye chappal bhi nikaal lee or ghar main ghusane se manaa kar diya
 Many such painful stories have been mentioned in this book
 lekin sochane vaali baat ye he ki in sab pareshaaniyon ko jhelane ke baad bhi rekha ne haar nahin maani
 She kept her spirits up and went to the level of success that every actress dreams of reaching

 ) Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal is very upset with Delhi Police these days
 alam yah he ki kejariwal ne police se samvaad bhi lagbhag band kar diya he
 Probably because on Thursday, when he reached the press in front of the press with his ministers, to this day, Kejriwal lied outright when asked why he did not talk directly to the police commissioner
 unhone kaha ki police kamishnar chuttee par hai
 The political ruckus that started for AAP on Wednesday had not stopped yet that on Thursday, CM Kejriwal was seen getting caught in another case
 darasal, dilli police ke sabase bade sahab kamishnar bhimsen bassi har roj kii tarah aaj bhi apane daftar main hi baithe the
 In the same police headquarters from where he sees the functioning of Delhi Police
 yah headqwater siem ke sachivalay se mahaj kuch meter kii duuri par he
 But Arvind Kejriwal, along with his ministers, not only attacked the Delhi Police, but also told the Commissioner present at the headquarters on leave
 LG se bhi mili bassi to chuttee par kaisedilli police kamishnar bhimsen bassi ne guuruuvaar ko na sirf police mukhyalay main kaamkaaj dekha, balki vah uparajyapal se milane gaye
 In such a situation, the question is whether the leave of the Police Commissioner is only for the CM
 baharhaal, jab siem kejariwal ke bayaan par kamishnar sahab kii raay lene kii koshish kii gai to vah kanni kaat gaye
 Bassi said that he is not aware of any such statement and he has not watched TV
 dilli ke siem or kamishnar sahab bhale hi is maamle par alag-alag baat kar rahe hon, lekin is puri ghatana se ek baat to saaf he ki kejariwal or bassi ke bich in dinon jaruri samvaad bhi puri tarah band he
 At the same time, the way Kejriwal has lied today, it also reinforces the statement of AAP leader Vinod Kumar Binny that Kejriwal is now lying

 Only one man survives — his nephew Balvanta
 film ke aakhri dialog main balavanta kahata he, ‘‘chachaa, ham police ke haath nahin aaenge
 "here the film ends, but the story of Chambal's ravages changing forever probably begins somewhere later
" or is nai kahani kaa plot hamen dikhaa 2013 kii janvari main jaade ke us sard din jab sarson ke lahalhate khet kohre kii chadar main dhake the
 33,000 crore for the locality at Indore Investors Meet
 ke nivesh kaa prastaav aae bahut din nahin hue the
 And instead of splashing about the bandits in the Chambal River, there was a children's picnic at Chambal Safari
 isi din balavant singh tomars (60 saal ke balavanta ab isi naam se jane jate hai) gwalior ke bahari ilaake main apane sand stone krashar par baithe aag senk rahe the
 Despite his favorite khaki dress and Khanty Chambal top, he is now a new-age entrepreneur, not a bandit
 vakt kaa pahiyaa ghumaa kaise? balavant singh ne 36 saal puraani yaadon ko taaja karte hue kaha, ‘‘agar jeene kaa koi izzatdaar jariya bana rahe to koi behad main kudana nahin chahta
 Over time, both police and public attitudes have changed
 chachaa jab behad main koode the, tab police kaa ravaiya yah tha ki jab tak 8-10 laashen na gir jaaen, thanedaar rapat likhane ko taiyaar nahin hota tha
 Today, children are studying, the era is changing
 ’’darasal, us muthbhed ke paanch saal baad 1982 main balavant ne madhya pradesh ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri arjuna singh ke saamne aatmasamarpan kiya or jail chale gaye
 When he came out of jail, weaving a new fabric of life, who wanted to weave many dacoits after surrendering at that time
 unhone stone krashar mashine lagavaayin
 Taught children
 unke teen bete jahaan bijnesaman hai, vahiin ek betaa fouj main he
 What Balwant, the notorious dacoit of his time, surrendered in 1972 by 82-year-old Mohar Singh and today he has a large farm
 yahi nahin raubadaar galmuchh rakhane vaale mohar singh 1995 main bhind jile kii mehagaanv nagarpalika ke adhyaksh bhi rahe
 But the surrender in that period did not mean that the dacoits ended forever, it can be said to be the beginning of change
 chambal main dakaiton kaa puri tarah safaya hua 2006-2010 ke bich
 During this the surrender was less and the encounter was more
 aapaki niti kya thi, is sawaal par madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne india today ko bataaya, ‘‘kaam karnaa he, to karnaa he
 Cleaning up the dacoits was a similar task and we did it
 ’’ ‘kar dikhaaya’ vaale jumale kii tah main jate hue 2009 tak chambal range ke police mahanireekshak rahe varisht ipies adhikari sanjay jha ne kaha, ‘‘prashasan ke saaf nirdesh ke saath hi hamen uttar pradesh or rajasthan ke chambal vaale ilaake kii police kaa puraa sahyog mila
 This was the effect of the joint siege, which could accomplish such a difficult task
 ’’ dakaiton ke behad main kudane kii vajah ke sawaal par jha kehete hai, ‘‘yahaan ke pani main hi kuch asar he
 People make small things a matter of pride
 paan singh tomars hi kya maine kai phogiyon ko behad main utarate dekha
 "the effect of the elimination of the dacoits will be said that not only are the former bandit enterprises putting up their presence here in Bhind, Morena, Sheopur and Datia affected districts of gwalior-chambal division, but well-known companies are also registering their presence here
" 
 iske alaava yah shiksha kaa pramukh kshetra banakar ubhara he

 Even though the plan is still at a very early stage, the way the Chief Minister conducted an aerial survey of the area before the Global Investors Conference held in Indore between October 28-30 last year, the importance of this scheme is understood
 gwalior ke aadharbhoot dhaancha vikaas nigam ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha, ‘‘hamane coridor ke liye nae ilaakon ke chayan kaa kaam shuru kar diya he
 We want to start this project as soon as possible
 ’’rajya ke udyog mantri kailash vijayawargeey ne kaha, ‘‘kai udyogpati dilli or noida main badhate aparaadh se chintit hai or ham aise udyogpatiyon se sampark kar rahe hai
 "the state government plans that land acquisition should not become a major problem while developing an industrial corridor, so the units built here should reserve 50 percent jobs for the local people
" is ilaake ko dilli ke counter magnet audyogic kshetra ke rup main viksit karne kii yojana ensiaar planning board kii bhi he
 Gwalior has also been declared a Counter Magnet Industrial Area
 haalanki is kaam kii gati bahut tej nahin he
 Regarding this, Chauhan said, "we have sent a proposal to the Central Government, although the Center has not shown much speed
 ’’ lekin rajya or centre kii yojanaayen bataa rahi hai, ki gwalior-chambal kshetra audyogikaran ke daravaaje par dastak de rahaa he
 The sandstone cutting industry is already well established in the area
 agra-mumbai rajmarg ke muraina-gwalior vaale khand par is samay kareeb 100 sand stone krashar kaam kar rahe hai
 Balwant Singh said, "here the sandstone extracted from the surrounding mines is converted into tiles from where it is sent to exporters of Delhi and Jaipur
" ’’ salanaa 300 karod ru
 This sandstone reaches countries like America, Britain, Germany, Ireland, South Africa and Australia

 Whenever the office going friends gather, most of the things are related to the office
 koi kahata he ki offis kaa maahaul acha nahi hai to koi apane bos ko acha nahin bataata
 Some are angry with salary and some complain about their work
 jitne log, utani pareshaaniyaan
 There are very few people who do not complain about their office and work
 hameshaa apane offis or kaam ke bare main negative baat karne vaale log apane kariyar ke liye khud dushman bane hue rahete hai
 Let me tell you that promotion and good appraisal belongs to those who are happy with their work and boss
 jaaniye aakhir offis main khush rahanaa kyon he jaruri:1
 Only when you are happy can you concentrate on any project
 kai research se sabit hota he ki khush rahane vaale log zyada kaam karte hai or gunvattta kaa bhi khaas khyaal rakhte hai
 It instills both confidence and motivation in them
 2
 People who are happy always live with positive attitude
 dukhi rahane vaale log zyaadaatar samay yahi sochate hai ki yah project to unase nahin ho paaegaa
 It also affects their growth
 kai baar to negative atitude rakhane vaale ummidavaaron kii naukari bhi chali jaati he
 Positive behavior is good for both yourself and the company
 3
 Relaxing is as important for our lives as it is for our jobs
 offis main kai baar aapkeediajariject hote hai
 You may have done a good job and got someone else's credit
 phir bhi khud par control karnaa jaruri hota he
 4
 jo log khush rahete hai, wo na hi salaah dene se ghabaraate hai or na lene se
 In any work, he easily cooperates with others and takes help from others on time
 vahiin, offis main khush rahane vaale log apane juniurs ke menter bhi aasaani se ban jate hai
 5
 agar aap nae avasaron orchunautiyon ko swikarkarne lagate hai to aap apane aap ko top par dekhnaa bhi chaahate hai

 About fifteen hundred years have passed
 itane lambey arase main to yaadon par bhi vaqt kii gard chadh jaati he
 But the secret that is being talked about here is still alive after fifteen hundred years
 ek kila, jo pahaado par seenaa taane khadaa he, is kile main rahasy he
 Silence is the scream of curls, then there is a miracle somewhere
 kai kaufanaak haweliyon or kile ke qisse ab tak sune gaye hai
 There was no such mansion or fort where someone lives, so how true is the story, how much lies, this doubt always existed
 magar is kile main 'wo' rahati he or saath main rahati he uski ghunghruon kaa awaz
 Yes yes 
 
 'wo', jise mare 1500 saal biit chuke hai
 The magnificent fort that once stood like a palace has been transformed into ruins today
 magar yahaan kii zindagi yahaan ke qirdaaron ke saath aaj bhi zindaa nazar aati he
 The wilderness of the place still makes someone feel alive and when the day falls asleep after being tired, the desolation of the night is often broken by the clanging sounds of the ghungroos
 kalinger ke is durg main kaali gufaaon ke kai rahasyamai tilism hai
 As night falls, there is a strange movement in these caves
 din ke vakt ye kila jitna khamosh nazar aata he, raat ke vakt utana hi khaufnak
 At the height of 800 feet of the fort, the water stream flows from the bottom to the top
 banda main zamin se 800 foot oonchi pahadiyon par bana he kalinger kaa kila
 If someone called Kalinjar Durg a miracle, then someone called it a unique Tilsim
 bas yahi vajah thi ki qadam bhi besakhta pahari kii ore bad chale
 Several mysterious small and large caves appeared as soon as it entered the Kalinjar Fort
 wo gufaaen jiskaa ore to he, lekin chor kaa pataa hi nahin chalata
 That is, no one knows where the caves start, but where they end
 gufaaon main jagah jagah makadi ke jaale or ghurti billiyon kii nigahe rongte khadey detii hai, lekin in sabake baavjood khamoshi ke saath kadam gupha kii ore badhate gaye
 This dripping water between these dark caves was causing shudder in our body
 jaise jaise hamaare kadam gupha main andar kii ore batch rahe the, romaanch or bhi badhata ja rahaa tha
 In these dark caves, bats have made their home
 aage kii jagah ko patalganga kehete he
 There are not one or two caves in this fort, which were used to protect the boundaries in that period
 kile ke pashchami chor par hi ek or rahasmayi gupha thi
 This cave was thickly dark and there were strange sounds inside it
 kalinger ke rahasmayi kile main saat daravaaje he
 Out of these seven gates, there is a door that opens only in the silence of night and takes a path from here to Ranimhal where the noise of the ghunghr breaks the silence of the night and now we have to turn the evening to hear the sound of these ghungroos Had to wait for darasal kalinger kile main maujuud rani mahal he
 There was a time when Mahfils used to decorate every night in this palace
 kehane vaale kehete hai ki aaj 1500 saal baad bhi shaam dhalate hi ek nartki ke kadam yahaan usee tarah thirakane lagate hai
 The only difference is that now the sound of these ghungroos is not heart-wrenching but heart-shaking
 ghunghru kii aawaaj us nartki kii he jiskaa naam padmavati tha
 Whoever could see a glimpse of this beautiful beautiful dancer would become her crazy
 kehete hai jab uske ghunghru se sangeet bahata to chandel raja usamen bandhakar rah jate
 Padmavati was a devotee of Lord Shiva
 lihaaja khaskar karthik poornima ke din wo puri raat dil khol kar naachati thi
 Padmati is no longer there, but it is surprising that even after thousands of years, this fort is still inhabited by the voice of the ghumroos of Padmavati
 khud itihaaskaar bhi is sach ko maanate hai
 Once during the research, he had to stay in this palace late at night and then in the silence of the night, suddenly he heard the same ghungroos
 hajaaron saal puraane is kile kaa itihaas kuch aisa he ki log phir bhi in viraan khandharon kii ore khinche chale aate hai
 This fort used to be a mixture of the Chandel kingdom
 magar kile ke itihaas se alag logon ko zyada dilchaspee he kile main chupe khajaane se
 All the battles this fort has faced so far have only been with the treasure
 afvaahen hai ki kalinger ke kile main heere-jawaharaaton kaa ek bada jakhira maujuud he
 Seeing the paintings and stone carvings in this fort on the hill, it can be guessed that there must have been a lot of wealth in this fort
 aitihaasik saboot bataate hai ki kalinger ke kila par chhathi shatabdi se lekar 15ve shatabdi tak chandelon kaa shashan rahaa
 Ghaznavi, Qutubuddin Aibak and Humayun wanted to win this fort with them, but could not succeed
 is chamatkaari kile ko itihaas ke har yug main alag alag naam se janaa gaya, jiskaa baqayada hindu granthon main zikr bhi kiya gaya he
 Actually, Kalinjar means one who has a shabby age
 romaanch or chamatkaar se hatakar kalinger kaa puranic mahatv shiv ke vishpan se bhi he
 After drinking the Kalkoot found in Samudra Manthan, Shiva had rested in this Kalinjar and beat the speed of Kaal, hence the name of this place was Kalinjar
 nilkanth mandir ke upar hi pahaad ke andar ek or kunda he, jisase swarga kaha jaataa he
 It is also associated with religion
 pahaado par seenaa taane khadey is kalinger ke kile main kahin rahasy he, to kahi ghunghruon kaa khof
 Somewhere there is a miracle, and somewhere the thrill of dark caves
 yah hi vajah he ki kala auki shilp kii adbhut misaal abhi tak bizzat kaayam hai
 If you talk about fear, then the shadow of fear can be seen in the light of the beauty of this fort

 After all, how can a prisoner hang in the barracks of a prison
 choubison ghante kadi suraksha kaa daawa karne vaali tihaad jail ke surakshakarmi kya neend main madahosh the
 Ramsingh's suicide has raised questions about the attitude of Tihar jail administration
 faansee lagane kaa tareeqa, vakt or halaat or duusari kai baton ko lekar ahm sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 Now let's talk about technical questions
 1
 Ram Singh's height was 5 and a half feet, so how could his hands reach 7 feet high skylight
 2
 The way it is being told that Ram Singh made rope by tearing off blankets and clothes, questions are also being raised
 ram singh kii cell main 3 kaidi or so rahe the
 It must have taken a long time to make the rope, it is strange how no one got the idea of this
 3
 It is being told that he used the pulse of pajamas to hang himself
 use aise kapade kyon die gaye?4
 The family members of Ram Singh are raising an important question that the person who had a bad hand, made a rope with just one hand, made a noose, and then hanged himself with a single hand
 5
 The question is also why Ram Singh chose 5 o'clock in the morning to be hanged, while at 5 o'clock the prisoners are awakened
 to kya tihaad jail prashasan kuch tathyon par pardaa daal rahaa he
 6
 sawaal ye bhi he ki itani badi laaparvaahee ujagar hone ke baavjood, ab tak kisi par karrwai kyon nahin kii gai
 7
 ram singh gangrape cese kaa mukhya aaropee tha, uski suraksha par khaas nigaah kyon nahin rakhi gai
 8
 aapako yaad hoga ki jab ramsingh tihaad main laayaa gaya tha to kaidiyon ne buree tarah uski pitayee kii thi
 Ramsingh was then kept in a separate cell
 ab sawaal ye he ki itnaa kuch hone ke baavjood kya ram singh kii cell ke baahar 24 ghante nigaraanee rakhi gai thi
 9
 itane samvedansheel maamle ke aropiyon kii suraksha ke liye kya khaas intazaam kiye gaye the
 10
 or sabase bada sawaal ye ki ram singh kii khudakushi se pehle jail prashasan ko ye andeshaa kyon nahin hua ki wo aisi kisi ghatana ko anjaam de saktaa he
 
 
 Why precautionary arrangements were not made in advance
 ram singh ke pita ne khudakushi ko lekar shaq zaahir kiya he
 The father claims that Ram Singh was not one of the perpetrators
 unhone ne sibiai jaanch kii maang kii he
 The lawyers associated with the case are also not ready to consider it a suicide
 desh ko hilaa dene vaale is cese ke mukhya aaropee ne somvaar subah tihaad jail main faansee laga lee
 He was restless since Sunday night
 uski barrack main 3 or kaidi maujuud the
 Was seen walking and at 5 in the morning the guard of the prison found him hanging from the skylight above the door

 The RSS organizes this meeting for the purpose that the campaigners can talk openly
 aise main yah brain storming baithak aresas ke liye kaaphi upyogi hoti he
 Based on the feedback from the province campaigners, the Sangh helps in deciding the future strategies

 Meanwhile, Asaram's supporters have also beaten up the media in Jodhpur

 Jodhpur police can arrest Asaram, who fled from Bhopal to Indore ashram today
 jodhpur se police kii ek team bhi indore ke liye ravaanaa ho chuki he
 Late night the police team from Jodhpur has left for Indore
 asaram bhopal se flite pakadakar indore jane vaale the
 But his supporters at the airport misbehaved with Media
 kuch patrakaron se marpet bhi hui
 Due to the uproar, Asaram's flight was missed, after which Asaram reached Indore by way of Dewas
 lekin bhopal se lekar devas or indore tak asaram ne kisi se bhi baatcheet nahin kii
 Asaram sat in the front seat in the car and left for Indore without paying toll tax on the Dewas by-pass
 bypass par jab media ne unhen dekha to unhone camera dekhakar munh chipa liya
 Crossed the deadline but did not appear to have escaped from the police
 Asaram Bapu was to appear before the Jodhpur police by 9 pm on Friday night but he avoided making any excuse
 ab unke upar kanoonee shikanja sakht hota ja rahaa he
 Asaram also knows this, that's why he is not able to stay in one place

 Asaram Bapu is running away to escape the clutches of the Jodhpur police
 asaram ne har hatkandaa apanaaya
 Appeal in court, but despair came from everywhere

 During this phase of Bhagamabha, Asaram Bapu also tried ways of survival
 antim aradaas ke taur par adaalat main arzi daakhil karwaai thi ki is umr or is chole par daag achche nahin lagenge, lekin court ne bhi thenga dikhaa diya
 Baba's feeding face also wilted with the free advice of a judge of the Gujarat High Court
 jaj sahab ne saaf shabdon main kah diya ki behatar hoga arji waapas le len, khaarij kar diya to or mushkil khadi ho jaaegi
 Jumping, Asaram told white lies in the court
 sansaarik bandhanon se mukti kii booti bechney vaale asaram ne samadhi ke antim sanskaar main jane ke liye paap se panaah maangi thi
 But the judge clearly said how you talk, Baba, no one can escape from the law
 haalanki court se pehle bhi asaram ne police se bachane kii bahut koshish kii
 It took time to appear and then did not even pretend to kill Samadhi
 yahi nahin, ahmedabad se lekar surat or jodhpur se lekar indore tak bhi asaram ne apane upar lage aaropon par safai pesh kii
 But the law continued to do its job, so Asaram fled from Bhopal to Indore to escape from the police
 idhar jab bhopal main asaram ke chele gadar machaae hue the to rajasthan main mathania ke paas unke bhai bandhu aatank kaa alag prasad baant rahe the

 vaardaat tab hui thi, jab raju ek raat bike se apane ghar laut rahe the
 Two men shot him in the dark with intent to kill

 Team India has reached the semi-finals of the ICC World Cup
 manchester main 9 july ko viraat brigade kaa muqabla newjiland se hoga
 In this match, everyone's eyes will be on the toss before losing and winning
 yah isliye kyonki cricket ke is mahaasangram main toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne vaali tiimon kaa pradarshan behatar rahaa he
 Chase master Virat Kohli would also not like to change his strategy in the semi-final match against New Zealand
 aise main viraat kohli agar toss jitate hai to wo pehle ballebaaji karnaa pasand karenge
 Team India won by batting first 5 times Overall India won this tournament by batting 5 times first
 vahiin, 2 baar chej karte hue bharat ko jeet mili
 Also in one match England stopped India from chasing the target and India lost in this match
 world cap 2019 main bharat kaa abhi tak kaa pradarshnapahla match- bharat ne chej karte hue south africa ko 6 wicket se harayadoosraa match- bharat ne pehle ballebaaji kii or australia ko 36 ran se haraayatisraa match- newjiland ke khilaaf match barish ke kaaran radd ho gayachauthaa match- pehle ballebaaji kii or pakistan ko 89 ran se harayapaanchvaan match- pehle ballebaaji kii or afghanistan ko 11 ran se harayastha match- bharat ne pehle ballebaaji kii or westeindies ko 125 ran se harayasatvaan match- england ne pehle ballebaaji kii or bharat ko 31 ranon se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaathavaan match- bangladesh ke khilaaf bharat ne pehle ballebaaji kii or 28 ran se jeet hasil kinauvaan match- bharat ne chej karte hue srilanka ko 7 wicket se haraaya4 baar jeeta toss or chaaron baar mili jeetbharat ne 4 baar is world cap main toss jeeta or chaaron baar viraat kohli ne pehle ballebaaji chuni
 Interestingly, India won in these four matches
 vahiin, kohli 4 baar toss haare, jisamen ek baar team india ko pehle ballebaaji kaa mauka mila or is match main bharat ne pakistan ko 89 ran se rond diya
 Apart from this, India got a chance to chase the target in three matches, in which Kohli's team won 2 times and once lost to England
 world cap 2019 main pich kaa mizaaj2019 world cap main khele gaye 41 muqablon main 27 baar pehle ballebaaji karne vaali team ne jeet hasil kii he
 At the same time, only 14 times the teams batting for the second time have won
 world cap 2019 ke shuru ke 21 maichon kii baat karen to unamem 11 baar pehle ballebaaji karne vaali team ne jeet hasil kii he
 At the same time, it happened 10 times that the team chasing the target won the match
 iske alaava world cap 2019 main baad ke 20 maichon kaa parinaam dekhen to yah pehle khele gaye 21 muqablon se bilkul alag najar aata he
 In the subsequent 20 matches, the team batting first 16 times has won
 vahiin, mahaj 4 baar target chej karne vaali team jeet pai he
 The slowing World Cup pitches combined, as the World Cup journey progressed, the teams batting first benefited
 bharat ke tej gendbaaj jasprit bumraah ne bhi is baat kii ore ishaara kiya he
 He said that the pitch in the World Cup is getting slower over time
 aise main pehle ballebaaji karne vaali team ko phayda miltaa he kyonki duusari pari tak pich raf ho jaati he jisase gend balle par thik se nahin aa paati he
 In such a situation, Virat Kohli would also like to go along with this trend of the World Cup in the semi-finals
 agar wo aisa karte hai to pehle ballebaaji karte hue team india ek bada total bana sakati he or virdohi kheme ko dabaav main daalkar saste main samet sakati he

 The worship of Shiva in the month of Savan and the devotion of Shiva on the Monday of Savan brings happiness in the life of every devotee
 sawan maah ke somvaar vrath kii kadi main chauthe or antim somvaar kaa vrath behad shubh he
 It is believed that if you keep the fast for last Monday and worship Bholenath, then the fruits and virtues of all Mondays will be received
 dharmik manyata he ki somvaar kaa vrath karne se har vrati ke sabhi du:kha, ksht or pareshaaniyon se chhutkaaraa miltaa he or vah sukhi, nirogi or samrudh jivan kaa anand paata he
 The fast of the fourth and last Monday is very auspicious in the episode of Monday fast of the month of Savan
 is din somvaar ke saath dwadashi tithi he jiskaa purnank 3 banataa he, jiskaa swami guru he or chandramaa guru kii raashi dhanu main sthit he
 This is the yoga in which worshiping and fasting Shiva resolves all the problems that the devotees are feeling helpless about
 panditon kii maane to sawan ke chauthe somvaar ko jo bhi puure vidhi vidhaan se shiv kii pujan karegaa wo shiv kaa vishesh aashirwad paa legaa
 Worshiping children on this day can relieve sickness, get rid of accident and premature death, solve problems related to government and spiritual uplift to the devotee
 panditon kaa ye bhi kahana he ki agar aapane sawan ke somvaar kaa koi vrath nahin rakhaa he, to bhi pareshaan hone kii baat nahin he
 Because if you have fasted for the last Monday and worshiped Bholenath, then the fruits and virtues of all Mondays will be received
 kul milakar sawan ke is aakhri somvaar ko agar aapane thodaa sa vakt nikaalkar kar liya rudrabhishek auki laga liya bhagwaan main dhyaan, to khushiyon ke rup main bhagwaan kaa aashirwad barasegaa or lag bedaapaar jaeg
 After captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni defeated England badly in Ranchi, the stronghold, the Indian cricket team will now want to beat the visiting team in the fourth match to be held in Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) ground on Wednesday
 ranchi main pehali baar khele gaye kisi antarrashtriya cricket match main bhartiya team ne saharaneey pradarshan kiya tha
 He won by seven wickets after bundling the English team cheaply
 bhartiya team kaa yah pradarshan kochi se hi jari he or is kaaran khilaadiyon ke hausale buland hai
 On the same high spirits, India would like to force England to lose the ODI series in India for the third time in a row by owning this series at the PCA ground
 vaise beete do maukon par bharat ne 5-0, 5-0 se jeet hasil kii he lekin is baar yah aankada thodaa badla hua ho saktaa he kyonki english team rajkot main hue siries ke pehle match main jeet kaa khaataa khol chuki he
 Till the Rajkot match, everything was going well for the English team but suddenly the equations have changed for him
 english team ke captain elister cook is asamanjas main honge ki unke saathiyon ke khel main giravat ai he yaa phir bhartiya khilaadiyon ke khel kaa str sudhara he
 In this confusion, it may be difficult for Cook to win in Mohali and then Dharamshala
 cook ko yah baat samajni hogi ki uski team main pradarshan kii nirantarata kii kami he
 Sometimes his top order makes a century partnership for the first wicket and sometimes he does not even add 50 runs
 kabhi uskaa madhya kram tabadatod ballebaaji karata he or kabhi ranon ke tote pad jate hai
 It is the same for bowlers
 unke pradarshan main nirantarata kii kami ke kaaran hi english team ko kochi or phir ranchi main haar mili
 The English bowlers in Ranchi did not have a safe target to save the match

 Ajinkya Rahane, who has been included in the squad in place of Virender Sehwag, has consistently failed and that is why coach Duncan Fletcher organized a special practice session for him and noted his batting in Mohali
 rahane stareey ballebaaj hai
 His return to form will give India a lot of strength but at the moment its chances are low
 aise main bharat ke madhya kram ko hi ran banane kii jimmedaari nibhaani hogi

 There is a cold winter in Mohali and this can help Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Shami Ahmed to swing the ball
 yah maidan bharat ke liye lucky rahaa he
 India has won the last two matches played here
 vaise yahaan bharat ne ab tak kul 11 match khele hai, jinamein se saat main use jeet mili he jabaki chaar main haar
 India will have their second clash with England on this ground so far

 ham usee se ye jaan saken ki aakhir kaat car, jala kar, dubo kar or barood se uda kar jaan lenaa kaisaa jehad he?bagdadi ko talash karne kaa maksadasch to ye he ki ye khyaal aayaa jarur par saath hi ye dar bhi usee pal daraa gaya ki bagdadi se aamane-saamne hone kaa matlab hi maut he
 Anyway, the foreign media is his biggest target and special victim
 kyonki unhen maar kar use sabase zyada surkhiyaan milti hai
 The first video of Baghdadi's bestiality was to behead a journalist
 usee ke baad bagdadi kaa vahashipan or maarane se pehle naarangi rang kaa kapadaa pehanaane kaa uskaa chalan puri duniya ne janaa
 But then wondered whether Baghdadi had changed after killing thousands of people
 duniya tak apni baat pahunchane ke liye hamase mil le
 Talk to us and then let us go
 pahchaan chhupaakar rakhane kii naseehatmgar baghdad pahunchane ke 24 ghante ke andar-andar hamaari is soch kaa khud hamane hi galaa ghont dipha
 What to do? Far from Baghdadi, everyone was preventing us from going where Baghdadi's feet once were
 hamaari bhalaai chaahane vaale tamaam log baghdad se lekar mosul tak hamen hamaara camera, mike, hamaari pahchaan, sab chupa kar rakhane kii naseehat de rahe the
 So that by changing the disguise in a henchman of Baghdadi or in the city, his sleeper cell does not get caught sight of us
 or unhen ye khabar naa lag jaae ki ham hindi sahaafee yani bhartiya jarnlist hai
 Baghdadi is not right without fear of the camera
 magar uski khabar to dhundhani hi thi
 But the problem was that the common Iraqi, police, army all over Iraq will talk to you very lovingly
 magar jaise hi aap camera nikaalte hai yaa mike unki taraf badhaate hai to sabhi gunge ban jate hai
 We later came to know that the atmosphere of doubt created in this country since Saddam's era
 uskaa khauf aaj bhi he
 They think that they do not know what the government agency is doing with them, if they say something on camera? Everyone said in a tone, Baghdadi is dead, but we would have expected a little bit of opportunity to know the truth of Baghdadi
 Let's start trying
 par har baar ye koshish ek hi anjaam par jaakar khatm ho jaati
 Baghdagi is dead
 ji haa, hamane aam iraqi, iraqi intelligence, iraqi special forcej, iraqi sena or yahaan tak ki iraqi police se bhi alag-alag tareeke se baat kii
 Questioned
 par harek ne hamen puure yakeen se ek hi jawaab diya ki bagdadi ab jinda nahin he
 He is dead par bagdadi kaise mara
 Where did you die kab mara
 Who killed him? We also had to know this
 kyonki isse pehle bhi ham log 6 baar bagdadi kii maut ke bare main sun chuke the
 So when we went in depth and tugged them, they said that Baghdadi was killed by the Russian bomb and that too this year
 bagdadi kii maut kaa daawaam irakiyon ko is baat kaa yakeen he ki isi saal 11 june ko syria ke rakka shahar main hue bambaari main bagdadi maaraa ja chukaa he
 He said that Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was first wounded and then killed in the white Phosphorus bombing of Syria and Russian forces in the city of Raqqa
 iraqi local media ne bhi june main ye khabar dikhaai thi ki rakka shahar ke jis ilaake ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya vahaan na sirf iesas ke hathiyaaron kaa zakhira tha balki khud uskaa sargana abu bakar al bagdadi bhi tab vahiin maujuud tha
 America is still searching for Baghdadi
 Unlike those who claim Baghdadi's death, we found some people who said that Baghdadi is still alive
 par ghayal he
 Now the question was that if Baghdadi is alive, where can it be hidden? Is it still in Iraq or any area of syria? Let us tell you that the US has not even confirmed the Russian claim of Baghdadi's death
 america kaa kahana he ki uske paas bagdadi kii maut ke koi pukhta saboot nahin hai
 That is why the United States is still searching for a prize of ten million dollars
 al-baj main chupa ho saktaa he bagdadi!america intelligence sutron kaa kahana he ki iesas kaa chif abu bakar al bagdadi iraq ke duusare sabase bade shahar mosul se kareeb do sau kilometre pashchim main al-baj naam kii jagah par chupa ho saktaa he
 This place is very sparsely populated and isolated
 saath hi iesas ke asar vaali bhi
 Apart from Al Baz, security agencies have also kept a close eye on certain buildings in Raqqa
 shaq he bagdadi yahaan bhi ho saktaa he
 Even if Baghdadi is truly alive, the place of his hiding is constantly shrinking
 kyonki uske jite hue ek-ek kile lagaataar dhahte ja rahe hai
 Iraqi forces have won back Faluja, Ramadi, Samara, Tikrit, Baiji, Saadia, Jalawla, Mosul, tal-afar, Abu Kamal, Havizah and Anah
 ye iraq ke wo chote-bade shahar hai, jahaan par iesas kaa puri tarah khaatmaa ho chukaa he
 Several ISIS leaders absconded in the last week of October, with the Iraqi Forces also overthrowing IS from Havija
 do hafte tak chale jabardast sangharsh ke dauraan iraqi special forcej ne havija se saikadon aatankiyon ko maar bhagaaya
 Now Havija is also fully occupied by the Iraqi army
 khabar he ki havija haarane ke baad iesas ke kai bade netaa duusari jagah bhaag gaye hai yaa phir sarender kar diya he
 Preparations to liberate the city of Rava and Keenam There is tremendous panic among the remaining militants after being driven from each area of iraq and the escape of IS leaders and commanders
 ladane ke liye unke paas hathiyaaron kii kami ke saath paison kii kami bhi ho gai he
 Because of which the remaining terrorists are surrendering to save lives
 kul mila kar ab iraq main do hi aise shahar bache hai, jo aies ke kabje main hai
 One rava and the other qaim
 in ilaakon kii taraf bhi ab iraqi sena kooch kar rahi he or yahaan se bhi jaldi hi aies ke safaaye kii khabar saamne aa sakati he

 vishwa hindu parishad kii sant ucchadhikaar samiti ne ayodhya main vivaadit ramajanm bhoomi-babari masjid sthal ko teen bhaagon main baantne ke liye 30 sitambar ko aaye elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke faisle ko ucchtam nyaayalay main chunauti dene kaa faisla kiya he
 Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati, who presided over the vhp's high-powered Sant Samiti meeting on Wednesday, told reporters that the decision of the committee of saints appealed against the decision of the Allahabad High Court to divide the disputed site into three parts
 Will go and this responsibility should be entrusted to the party Trilokinath Pandey as Balsakha of Ramlala Virajman Shri
 swami saraswati ke saath samvaadadaata sammelan main upasthit vihip adhyaksh ashok singhl ne kaha ki adaalat ne yah sweekaar kiya he ki vivaadit sthal bhagwaan ram kaa janm sthal he or sant samiti kaa maananaa he ki ram or ram janmabhumi poojaneey hai or unka bantwaaraa nahin ho saktaa
 Singhal, describing the partition of Ramjanmabha as sharing of the country, said that the dispute could not be resolved through the sharing of the disputed site as the court has admitted that the entire land belongs to Ramlala
 sampoorn vivaadit sthal par bhavy ram mandir ke nirmaan kaa sankalp doharaate hue singhl ne kaha ki bharat sarkaar ko chahie ki vah kanoon banaakar sampoorn vivaadit sthal ram mandir ke nirmaan ke liye hindu samaaj ko saunp de

 Singhal clarified, 'they will not accept the construction of a mosque within the cultural boundary of Ayodhya
 ’baatcheet se vivaad ke samaadhaan kii disha main chal rahe prayaason ke bare main singhl ne kaha ki isse pehle bhi kam se kam chaar baar is disha main prayaas ho chuke hai lekin ve kaamyaab nahin hue
 VHP President Singhal also said that since Ayodhya is also a religious pilgrimage center, the Ayodhya Pilgrimage Development Authority should be set up for its proper development
 unhone kaha ki vikaas praadhikaran kaa gathan karke balmiki ramayana main varnit sabhi shraddha kendron ko dharmik tirth sthal ke rup main viksit kiya janaa chahie
 Singhal said that the vhp-run Jan Jagran program to build a grand temple of Ramlala at the site of Ram Janmabhoomi will continue till the temple is built
 udipi ke swami vishweshwar tirthji maharaj ne kaha ki yadi muslim samaaj vivaadit sthal ke bajaay kahin anya masjid bananaa chaahe to adaalat ke baahar maamle ke samaadhaan ke liye hamaare daravaaje hameshaa khule hue hai
 He said, 'muslim society has the opportunity to leave its claim from the disputed site and contribute to strengthen the mutual trust and brotherhood between the two communities
 ’baithak me paarit ek prastaav main santon ne kaha he ki aapasi baatcheet se vivaad ke samaadhaan kaa rasta hameshaa khulaa hua he or ham is disha main hone vaale kisi bhi prayaas main apane saanskrithik jivan mulyon or adasharen ke anusaar sakaaratmak sahyog ko hameshaa taiyaar hai
 The resolution also said that the High Court has given a golden opportunity to the Muslim society by deciding to give one third of the disputed site to the Muslims, by dedicating that land to the Ram temple and the two communities would be mutually Start a new chapter of harmony
 sampoorn vivaadit sthal ko bhagwaan ram kii krida, lila or sanskaar kii bhoomi bataate hue swami tirthji maharaj ne kaha ki adaalat ne bhi yah mana he ki vivaadit sthal bhagwaan ram kii janmabhumi he or ve hi puri bhoomi ke maalik hai
 VHP President Singhal said that a meeting of all the local saint Mahatmas of Ayodhya has been called on Thursday to inform about the decisions of the Sant High Powers Committee

 shahabaad ke gaanv main sandip singh (dilajit dosanjh ) apane bade bhai vikramjit singh (angad bedi), pita (satish kowshik) or mata ke saath rahata he
 In childhood, both brothers go to play hockey, but Sandeep does not want to play hockey, unhappy with the behavior of the coach
 ek din sandip kii najar mahila hockey khilaadi harprit (taapasi pannu) se takaraati he or usase pyaar ho jaataa he
 Sachin Tendulkarharpreet, who arrived with daughter Sara and wife at the screening of 'surma', wants Sandeep to play hockey and also participate in the World Cup for the country
 is vajah se sandip hockey khelnaa shuru kar detaa he
 In this, his elder brother Vikramjit Singh has a big hand
 kahani main twist tab aata he jab ek baar antarrashtriya pratiyogita main hissaa lene ke liye sandip singh train main baithte hai to unki peeth par goli lag jaati he
 After this, he goes into a coma
 jab wo coma se baahar aate hai, tab unke sharir ke neeche kaa hissaa paralise ho jaataa he
 After this Sandeep Singh's real struggle begins
 kyon dekhen?film kaa screenple kamaal kaa he, jisaki vajah se raftaar sateek he
 The cinematography of the film is good and the way of telling the story is amazing
 kuch vaakye aapako sochane par vivash karte hai to kahin-kahin aap imotional bhi ho jate hai

 According to reports, the film is being released on about 1000 screens in India
 film 'U' reating ke saath relies ho rahi he, jisaki vajah se verde of mouth sahi rahaa to acha rispons milane kii ummid he

 Many seats were won by winning such faces, which had no special identity before it
 lekin isi modi lahar main bijepi ke bade netaaon main se ek arun jetali chunaav haar gaye, wo bhi amritsar seat se
 Jaitley was fielded by the party, bypassing Navjot Singh Sidhu, a three-time MP from here
 haalanki amritsar loksabhaa seat hameshaa se hai profile or bade ulatpher ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Political background like Amritsar has its own glorious history
 swarna mandir amritsar kaa sabase bada aakarshan kaa centre he
 The entire city of Amritsar is situated around the Golden Temple
 amritsar apni samskruti ke alaava ladaaiyon ke liye bhi prasiddh he
 The biggest massacre of the Indian freedom struggle took place in Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar
 iske baad bharat or pakistan ke bich bantwaare ke dauraan hue khun-kharabe kaa bhi yah shahar gavaah he
 The city was also destroyed by the Afghan and Mughal rulers

 It got 3,80,106 votes with 74 percent votes
 tisare number par aam aadmi party ke dalajit singh rahe, jinhen 82,633 voton se santosh karnaa padaa
 In the by-election, Pawar's grip and strength were strong, but after the election of Amarinder Singh, the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat was held in 2017, and the Congress retained its seat
 congress ke gurjeet singh aujala ne bijepi ke rajinder mohan singh chhina ko ek lakh 99 hajaar 189 vot ke antar se haraa diya, or donon partiyon ke bich kareeb 20 fisad vot kaa faasla tha
 That is, the Congress has gradually strengthened its hold on this seat
 lekin 2009 tak is seat bijepi kaa varchasv rahaa he
 Navjot Singh Sidhu of BJP won the consecutive 2004, 2007 by-elections and 2009 Lok Sabha elections

 However, BJP is looking for a big Sikh leader to contest from here
 siddhu bhi lard sakate hai amritsar se chunaavvahin duusari or khabar he ki congress yahaan se navjot singh siddhu ko maidan main utaar sakati he
 There are two reasons behind this
 ek to is seat par siddhu kii pakad rahi he or doosraa amarinder singh se siddhu ke manmutav jagajaahir he
 Amarinder also wants Sidhu to be sent to the Lok Sabha through Amritsar seat so that he will not be challenged by Sidhu in Punjab
 saamaajik taana-bandgar aazaadee ke baad se is loksabhaa seat par najar daalen to isapar congress kaa dabadabaa rahaa he
 Since 1952, the Congress has won from here 12 times, there are a total of 9 assembly seats inside the Amritsar Lok Sabha
 isamen se 8 par congress kaa kabja he, jabaki ek seat par akali dal ko jeet mili he
 Based on the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Amritsar has a total of 14,77,262 voters, including 7,79,164 male and 6,98,098 female voters
 amritsar shahar kaa naam ek talab ke naam par rakhaa gaya he, jiskaa nirmaan guru ramdaas ne karaayaa tha

 lekin doctor nahin pighale or anitha ne jila aspataal ke daravaaje par hi bachche ko janm diya
 It can be understood that how difficult it is for the general public to get treatment in state government hospitals
 doctoron or aspataal karmiyon kaa is tarah kaa ravaiya or suvidhaon kaa nitant abhaav pradesh ke sarkari aspataalon kii asaliyat he
 But instead of trying to improve it, government doctors, officials and leaders are clashing with each other

 Health ministers busy in resolving these disputes are unable to do anything to improve health facilities
 is sab ke bich pis rahi he to aam janata
 Freed from the stigma of the Bimaru state, Madhya Pradesh is lagging badly on the health facilities front
 yahaan badi sankhya main doctoron ke pad khaali hai, sarkari aspataalon kii haalat khasta he or usase bhi bure halaat praathmik swasthya centre (piechasi) or saamudayik swasthya kendron (siechasi) ke hai
 According to the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence, in the year 2012-13, out of a total of 1,156 phcs in Madhya Pradesh, only 814 had doctors and only 267 out of 333 chcs were specialists
 asal main jo doctor hai ve bhi aadhe se zyada vakt aspataal se gaayab rahete hai or aspataal main hote hai to marij ko kisi anya aspataal main refer kar dete hai
 In such a situation, the patient has no option but to wander from rate to rate

 Says Ravi Shankar Dalmia, "this problem is of the whole country

 Ajay Khare says, "principal Secretary's instructions are not practical
 unka kahana he ki doctor ko har din opidi main 20 puraane or 25 nae marij dekhne honge
 After this duty, the doctor will have to go to the village and inspect the health centers
 yahaan tak ki aspataal main kai prashasnic kaam bhi doctoron ke hawaale kar die gaye hai
 During the treatment, if the patient's condition becomes serious, strict action is taken against the doctors

 Now government doctors are planning to go on strike, here the government is seeking legal advice, calling it contempt of court
 doctoron kii kami ek badi samasya he
 There are surgeons in 254 government hospitals of the state but there are no anesthesia specialists
 pradesh main visheshgy doctoron ke kul 3,195 pad hai lekin inamen se keval 1,063 pad bhare gaye hai
 1,386 posts of obstetric, pediatric and anesthesia specialist are approved but only 419 are employed
 nijee aspataalon main behatar vetan or aadhunik sukh-suvidhaon ke chalate doctor sarkari naukari nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 In 2013, the state government had advertised the recruitment of 1,320 doctors, but out of the 825 doctors selected, only 334 joined the job
 swasthya suvidhaon ke maamle main madhya pradesh padosi rajyon se bhi pichhadaa hua he
 In Rajasthan, for example, there are 1,755 doctors in a total of 1,528 phcs and 2,760 doctors in 1,811 phcs in Maharashtra
 pradesh sarkaar embibies or piji karne vaale doctoron se bond bharwati he jisase unke liye gaanvon main nishchit avadhi tak kaam karnaa anivaary hota he

 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi has slammed Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 susheel modi ne ravivaar ko twit kar kaha, jinhen ensisi ke bare main pataa nahin he, ve bharat kaa pradhanmantri banane kaa sapana dekh rahe hai
 During the visit to Karnataka, when asked about NCC by a student of Maharani Art College, Mysore, Rahul Gandhi said that he was not aware about it
 susheel modi ne kaha ki jis congress ne 1950 se 1977 tak 27 saal main desh ke samvidhan ko 42 baar badla or isaki mul bhaawanaaon se chhedchhad kii, uske adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko dusron par aarope lagane se pehle apane purvajon kaa itihaas palatnaa chahie
 If his grandmother Indira Gandhi imposed emergency on the country and demoralized democracy through an amendment, then father Rajiv Gandhi denied the helpless Muslim woman, Shahbano, the alimony
 modi ne argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadavapar faisle ke dauraan sibiai kii vishesh court kii tippanee par kaha ki avibhajit bihar ke jin sarkari khajaanon se karodon rupee kii avaidh nikasi ho rahi thi, uski jaankaree tatkaaleen mukhyamantri lalu prasad ko hone ke baavjood unhone na jaanch karai, na sandigdh logon ke khilaaf karrwai kii, balki vah garib janata ke paise kii lut main shaamil afasaron ko bachaate bhi rahe
 The BJP leader said that 80 percent of the scam amounted to politicians and officers
 sibiai kii vishesh adaalat ke taaja faisle main kahi gayi in baton kaa argedy ke paas koi jawaab nahin he
 The fodder scam was the darkest chapter to taint the politics of Bihar
 gujarat main loksabhaa chunaav ke liye namakan daakhil karne kii aakhri taarikh 4 april he, lekin ab tak bijepi or congress gujarat main apane ummidavaaron ko dhund nahin pai hai
 In Gujarat, the Congress is yet to announce the names of 13 candidates, while the BJP has to announce the names of 3 candidates
 bhaajapa ne jahaan apane 6 maujuuda saansadon ke tikat kaate to vahiin congress abhi bhi bhaajapa ummidavaar ke saamne apane majboot ummidavaar dhund rahi he
 The Congress feels that a strong candidate can give a befitting reply to the BJP at the ground level
 haalanki, congress sutron kii maane to abhi congress or ensipi, congress or chotu bhai vasava kii bhartiya tribal party ke bich gathbandhan yaa siton kaa bantwaaraa nahin ho paaya he, jisase ki abhi bhi kuch siton ko lekar pench fansaa hua he
 At the same time, the matter is complicated in Surat seat in BJP
 surat loksabhaa seat ko lekar vahaan do gut patidaar or suurati ban gaye hai
 In such a situation, if the ticket is given to Surti, then the Patidars will have to face resentment, while if the Patidar is given the ticket from this seat, then the people of Surti may have to face the displeasure
 is maamle ko sulajhane or patidaaron ko manaane ke liye kisi majboot bijepi netaa ko yahaan se chunaav ladaaya ja saktaa he, jisase ki suurati or patidaaron kaa maamla hi khatm ho jaae
 At the same time, both the BJP and Congress parties are confused about the name of the candidate regarding Mehsana
 1984 main jab indira gandhi kii hatya hui thi or puure desh main congress kii lahar thi tab bhi mehsana seat par bhaajapa ne jeet darj kii thi, tab se is seat par bijepi kaa dabadabaa rahaa he
 However, after the Patidar agitation, the BJP has been defeated in the assembly elections
 aise main yahaan se ab tak tikat kii ghoshnaa na to bijepi ne kii he or na hi congress ne
 The BJP and Congress are also caught in the seat east of Ahmedabad
 is seat par bijepi ne pichhali baar paresh rawal ko chunaav ladaaya tha, lekin is baar paresh rawal ne chunaav ladane se pehle hi inkaar kar diya he
 In such a situation, the number of people seeking tickets to contest the BJP seat here is quite high
