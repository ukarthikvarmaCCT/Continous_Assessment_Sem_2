 72 lakh shikshamitron kii niyuktiyon ko radd karne ko kaha gaya tha

 According to sources, Parrikar made this statement in relation to former Prime Minister IK Gujral
 indra kumaar gujral saal 1997-98 main ek saal se thode kam samay tak bharat ke pradhanmantri rahe the
 Then the United Front government led by him had the support of Congress
 gujral kaa saal 2012 main nidhan ho chukaa he
 The Defense Minister said, after all, AAP has to prepare the assets (deep assets)
 ye sampada 20-30 saal main taiyaar hui
 It is sad that there were some Prime Ministers who made agreements on property
 haalanki unhone kaha, main naamon kaa khulaasa nahin karne ja rahaa hum
 Parrikar said that he had not given details about the Coast Guard's operation regarding the boat coming from Pakistan, as it could compromise the source of information

 Most mobile apps on the Internet are available for free or at very low prices, but still no one downloads them
 aakhir kaaran kya hai? america internet analytics company com score ke haalia report ke mutabik, america main smartphone rakhane vaale logon ne kisi khaas maheene main ek bhi ap downlod nahin kiya
 It may be that they do not need it
 darasal, fasebuk, google, twitor, whats ap, yahuu aadi ap unke paas pehle se hote hai, jinase unki amuman sabhi jaruratein puri ho jaati hai
 An average of one third of people who own a smartphone downloaded an app a month
 comuscore kii report ke mutabik, 'kisi khaas maheene ke dauraan downlod kii jitani bhi gatividhiyaan huin, unamem aadhi gatividhiyaan smartphone rakhane vaale keval saat fisadi logon ne kii
 'another surprising thing is that about 42 per cent of the time spent on all the apps of the smartphone is usually spent on one app, which they use the most

 maharashtra main shivasena ke haath aa rahi mukhyamantri kii kursi bijepi ne raaton-raat'sargical strike' karke chin lee he

 bijepi or shivasena ne milakar bahumat kaa 145 kaa aankada paar kar liya tha
 But Shiv Sena kept demanding 50-50 formula according to which the model of running the government was two and a half years
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke saath samjhauta isi formule par hua tha lekin bijepi kaa daawa he ki aisa koi samjhauta nahin hua
 This led to differences so much that the two-year old friendship of the two parties was broken
 sharad pavaar ne kaha yah NCP kaa faisla nahin According to news agency ANI, Sharad Pawar has said that supporting BJP is a personal decision of Ajit Pawar
 ensipi isamen shaamil nahin he
 Sharad Pawar said, 'I do not support his decision in any way' Sharad Pawar: Ajit Pawar's decision to support the BJP to form the Maharashtra Government is his personal decision and not that of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)
 We place on record that we do not support or endorse this decision of his

 The state government was on target of BJP and its allies for immersion of idols of Durga Puja, the biggest festival in Bengal
 mamata ne durga puja samitiyon se muharram ke pavitra maheene ke 10wein din 1 oktober yani vijayadashami ke agle din pratimaaon kaa visarjan na karne ko kaha tha
 Until Friday morning, the Bengal Police did not receive any application from community Durga Puja organizers regarding the immersion of the idol
 bataa den ki bengal main 1 oktober ko pratimaa visarjan ke liye police kii anumati leni thi
 On this day, people of the Muslim community will mourn the martyrdom of Imam Hussain
 yah parampara muharram ke pavitra maheene kaa hissaa he, jo islamic calendar kaa pehla maheenaa he
 As soon as the Navratri began, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had announced a ban on statue immersion on October 1, after which the BJP and its organizations accused Mamata of appeasing the minority community

 court main maat khaane ke baad rajya sarkaar ne puja aayojakon se pratimaa visarjan ke liye police ke paas samay rahete advance main aavedan karne ko kaha
 The state's Editions Director General (law and Order) Anuj Sharma told Hindustan Times that no application has come from the worship organizer on October 1 for the immersion of the statue
 unhone kaha ki sabhi jilon ko milakar 25 hajaar puja community hai or ab tak hamen ek bhi aavedan nahin mila he
 a senior officer of the Kolkata Police denied that an application could be received at the last moment
 adhikari ne kaha ki agar kisi tarah kaa koi aavedan miltaa he, to us par court ke aadeshaanusaar karrwai hogi
 State Home Secretary Atri Bhattacharya said that the administration would take any decision given the situation
 unhone kaha ki bengal main jin teen panchangon ko mana jaataa he, unamem se koi bhi 1 oktober ko pratimaa visarjan kii anumati de rahaa, jis din ekadshi bhi he
 According to reports, Trinamool Congress leaders were also appealing to the worship committees not to immerse the statue on 1 October
 rajya sarkaar ke ek cabinet mantri ne kaha ki hamaare netaaon kaa 95 pratishat puja samitiyon par prabhaav he
 Some are under the influence of Congress leaders
 mujhe ummid he ki ve sampradayik sadbhaav ko bigaadane jaisaa koi kaam nahin karenge
 Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had attacked the BJP and the Sangh with a bitter attack on the statue immersion
 mamata ne kaha tha ki bhagava sanghathanon kii yojana dashami ke maukey par shastr puja karne kii he, joki bengal kii samskruti nahin he
 Earlier, on the last day of the festival i
e
 Vijayadashami, a large number of devotees from community worship pandals from all over West Bengal paid their last farewell to Goddess Durga on Saturday

 mamata ke is daawey par biferi congress ne isse pehle yah kehete hue mamata ke bayaan ko kharij kiya tha ki sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar apana kaarykaal puraa karegi
 After the Congress rejected Mamata's claim, Trinamool MP Derek o'brien tweeted, "I want to clarify that only half the truth in this case has been made news
" mujhe khushi hogi ki samprag sarkaar apana kaarykaal puraa kare
 The Congress reacted to Banerjee's claim that there was no possibility of a mid-term election in the country, and the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government would complete its second term
 congress pravaktaa raashid alvi ne kaha, 'maine banerjee kaa bayaan nahin dekha he, lekin ek baat spasht he ki samprag sarkaar apana doosraa kaarykaal puraa karegi or chunaav nirdhaarit samay par (2014 main) hi hoga

 yechuri ne kaha, 'hamen yah sochane kii jarurat he ki kaise choti partiyaan sarkaar ko blackmel kar rahi hai
 Banerjee told her party workers that they should be ready for the election
 banerjee ne kaha tha, 'mujhe soochna mili he ki dilli main is tarah kii ek baithak hui he
 For now, i will not tell which party held the meeting
 vah party 2013 main hi loksabhaa chunaav karana chaahati he
 'banerjee had said,' Any day we may have to face elections

 '' pakistan ne bharat ke naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak ko padosi deshon ke maamalon main ‘dakhal' kaa ‘durbhaavnapurna iraadaa' bataaya
 Late on Monday, the Lok Sabha approved the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), which provides for citizenship of India to non-muslims who have come to India as refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan by 31 December 2014 who face religious persecution
 Be lying unhen avaidh pravasi nahin mana jayega
 It is worth mentioning that Home Minister Amit Shah while presenting the bill in Lok Sabha made it clear that people of any religion need not be afraid in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government
 unhone jor dekar kaha tha ki is vidheyak se un alpsankhyakon ko raahat milegi jo padosi deshon main atyaachaar kaa shikaar hai
 Amit Shah said, 'in 1947, the minority population in Pakistan was 23 percent
 2011 main 23 pratishat se kam hokar 3
 7 percent
 bangladesh main 1947 main alpsankhyakon kii aabaadi 22 pratishat thi jo 2011 main kam hokar 7
 8 percent

 8 in 2011 which were 8 percent
 8 pratishat ho gayi
 That is why it is wrong to say that discrimination on the basis of religion is happening in India
 unhone kaha ki dharm ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav na ho rahaa he or naa aage hoga
 The bill is not discriminatory against any religion and is for oppressed minorities within three countries who are refugees, not intruders

 Meanwhile, the party once again elected Sonia Gandhi as the leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party

 However, its authority has already been given to Sonia as a parliamentary party leader

 The party leaders want Rahul to continue in the post of president
 vahiin, rahul kisi gaiyr-gandhi ko ye jimmedaari dene par ade hai
 In such a situation, the big question is that the role of Sonia Parliamentary Party leader, Rahul Lok Sabha Leader and General Secretary in the party Priyanka Gandhi, then the role of non-gandhi president will be no more than rubber stamp
 aise halaat main loksabhaa ke 52 saansadon main congress main behatar pakad or varishthata ke lihaaj se teen naam ubharate hai- shashi tharur, manish tiwari or adheer ranjan choudhary
 The reason is that most of the mps are from Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Punjab and are also new
 vahiin, pichley 5 saalon main mallikarjun khadge loksabhaa main party ke netaa rahe, wo khud chunaav haar chuke hai
 If we talk about Shashi Tharoor, his profile is large, but his intellectual face does not fit the party till the village poor of North India
 saath hi apni patni kii maut ke maamle main wo aaropee hai or wo maamla abhi tak khatm nahin hua he
 Apart from this, Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, a multiple-time MP from Bengal, who is considered to be hot tempered with a sharp temper, has been a staunch opponent of Mamata Banerjee
 ab sansad main mamata kii party ke saath kii baat aegi to maamla ulajh saktaa he
 In such a situation, Manish Tiwari's name emerges rapidly

 congress party ke sachiv bane, uske baad party kii youth wing ke youth congress ke adhyaksh bhi rahe
 Manish was also made the Minister of Information Broadcasting in the UPA government
 manish party ke pravaktaa arase se hai
 However, in 2014 elections, due to health reasons, Manish had refused to contest from his seating seat Ludhiana due to not getting Chandigarh seat, after which the high command was not happy with him, but by giving this responsibility to Manish, the party can give the message that Congress Workers who have risen from the ground can be given great responsibility
 haalanki, baad main manish ne apane swasthya kii baat saamne rakhi
 Over the years, he favored the party
 hindi-angreji donon bhashaaon main manish acchhee pakad rakhte hai
 However, during the Anna movement, he had a lot of grudge against Anna Hazare for having a press conference with bad words
 uske baad manish ne shabdon ke chayan main khaasi saavdhaanee baratna shuru kiya
 Manish desperately asked for a ticket to contest in the Punjab Assembly elections, perhaps to send a message to the high command that he was not among those running away from the election
 aise main manish tiwari agar loksabhaa main congress ke netaa bana die jaaen, to chaunkane jaisaa kuch nahin

 report main mumbai police ke sahaayak police ayukta (asipi) anil mahabhole or daaud ibrahim kii prabhaavshaalee bahan hasina parkar ke bich santhganth kaa byora he
 This report was four years old but still significant
 mahabhole ne angreji dainik mid-de main de ke sahyogi tarakant dvivedi urf akelaa ko may main dhamkaaya tha
 Akela was arrested under the Government Secrets Act, 1923
 unka kasoor unhone khabar di thi ki 26 / 11 ke baad government railway police ko mili assault riflon ko kis tarah ek geele kamare main rakhaa gaya tha jiske kaaran ve apatsthiti main kargar nahin ho sakati thim
 He paid the price for exposing the inefficiency of the police by spending five days in GRP lockup
 rajya sarkaar ke hastkshep ke baad hi unhen reeha kiya gaya
 Dey paid the truth for his life
 iske baad mumbai police ne mahabhole kaa tabadalaa kar diya, haalanki maharashtra ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ne elaan kiya ki unhone isaki manjuuri nahin di thi
 Dey's murder and the rise of Mahabole is a reflection of Mumbai's crime world

 No greed and greed are considered legitimate

 People like Chhota Shakeel, an associate of fugitive Dawood Ibrahim, appear on national TV and deny their role in Dey's murder
 mumbai police ke varisht adhikariyon ke mutabik, sarkaar ko maaloom he ki chota shakeel or daaud pakistan ke karachi shahar main hai, lekin na to vah unhen laana chaahati he, na hi unhen laane main sakasham he
 Patil promised Dey to act on the 2007 report
 isamen desh kii vittiya rajdhani main police, anderworld or bilderon ke network kaa vistrut byora he
 In January this year, the nexus between the police and the underworld became evident from the conversation that the police had recorded
 usamen chota shakeel se ek police upayukta (disipi) ko ek builder se jabaran ugaahi na karne kaa aagrah karte suna gaya
 The same police officer is believed to have spoken to former cricketer Javed Miandad
 miyandad ke bete kii shaadi daaud kii beti se hui he
 This justifies the ACB report, and indeed Dey
 maharashtra ko rajnatik chande ke maamle main agrani rajya or mumbai ko uskaa sabase keemtee namoona mana jaataa he
 So, it is unlikely that Patil or any other leader will interfere in the world of crime in Mumbai
 yah vishaal samrajya he, jiskaa dayera real estate, bollywood ke kuch hisson, netaaon, hawala, tel main milawat, taskari, share bazaar, cricket sattebaaji or haftaa vasuuli tak failaa he

 The biggest evidence of this being a defender is that two police constables were stationed at the house of Dawood Ibrahim's brother Iqbal Kaskar on Pakmodia Street in the crowded Bhendi Bazaar area in May this year

 Whenever there is a dispute between builders, the mafia gangster jumps into it

 The underworld has divided Mumbai into different regions

 Ironically, when Patnaik took over as the Commissioner of Police in February this year, one of his priorities was to end the nexus between the police and the builders

 It is said that the whole family did so to express their gratitude to God, at the instance of Lalit, at the instance of the father's soul, as they felt that the work done at Lalit's request gave the family a lot of happiness

 India and Russia will soon build a new generation brahmos missile with a range of 600 km
 is 600 kilometre range vaali is missile kii jad main puraa pakistan hoga
 India has become a part of the Missile Technology Control Regime in June this year
 'times of india' kii khabar ke mutabik iske parinamswaroop hi rus bharat ke saath milakar yah missile banayega
 According to the MTCR guidelines, the countries involved in the club cannot share or sell missile technology of more than 300 km range to an outside country or together make missiles
 bharat ke paas jo maujuudabrahmos missilhai uski maarak kshamta 300 kilometre tak hi he
 This makes it difficult to target the internal areas of Pakistan
 haalanki bharat ke paas next jenereshan brahmos missile se zyada maarak kshamta vaali misile hai lekin brahmos kii khaasiyat he ki vah nishchit lakshya par hamalaa kar saktaa he
 No matter how much protection is given to that goal

 The Hazare-side remark is significant in the sense that in June, anti-corruption activists met Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in Delhi and assured him of helping shape the Lokayukta Bill in the state
 iske baad nitish ke aamantran par hazaare-paksh ke sadsy patna bhi gayi the or masauda taiyaar karne ke liye kuch ahm suzav diye the

 'kejriwal said about the proposed bill of Bihar,' It has put the process of selection, suspension and removal of Lokayukta under the control of the government
 is tarah yah swatantra nahin rah paayegaa
 The Lokayukta will also have to seek permission from the government to conduct an investigation and prosecution against any government official
 ’kejariwal ne kaha ki bihar ke masauda lokayukta vidheyak main praavdhaan he ki niraadhaar shikaayat daakhil karne ke liye shikayatakarta ko kisi adhikari ke bhrasht paye jane jitani hi sajaa yani chah maheene se lekar paanch varsh tak ke karawas kii sajaa hogi

 ye vahi praavdhaan hai, jo centre sarkaar ke lokapal vidheyak ke masaude main maujuud hai or jinke khilaaf anna ko anshan karnaa padaa tha
 'significantly, the Bihar cabinet decided that suggestions will be sought from the public by 22 November on the draft Lokayukta Bill
 sambhaavna he ki yah vidheyak disambar main bihar vidhansabha ke sheetakaaleen satr main pesh kiya jaayegaa
 If you face the problem of exhausting the dishonored LPG cylinder at home, then there is good news for you
 ab aapako rasoi gas ke silendar petrol pump par bhi aasaani se mil jaaenge
 At the petrol pump, not only petrol diesel but also LPG will be available
 sarkaar ne ek aise prastaav ko hari jhandi di he jisamen petrol pump se rasoi gas ke chote silendaron kii bikri ho sakegi

 iske alaava ye silendar paane ke liye regular conection kii or kagaji karrwai zarurat nahin hogi
 Initially, the customer will have to pay the cost of the cylinder and gas but later the gas will have to be paid with the empty cylinder to get the refill
 jaahir si baat he ki ye silendar un logon ko kaaphi kaam aaenge jo zyada gas kaa istemaal nahin karte or apane rahane kii jagah baar-baar badalte hai
 Joint Secretary of Petroleum Ministry Neeraj Mittal said, "we will make 5 kg cylinders available at market prices
" philhal ek payalat product iske liye launch kiya ja rahaa he
 According to sources, at today's market price these 5 kg cylinders will be available to the customers for around Rs 415 but these rates will keep changing according to the fluctuations in the international market
 jaankaar ise ek acha kadam bataate hue kehete hai ki isse rasoi gas kii kalabazari par bhi lagaam lagegi
 So far, petrol pumps that give you petrol diesel will now also sell LPG cylinders
 bhale hi ye silendar bazaar bhav par hi milenge lekin aam aadmi kii dikkaton ko dur karne main kaaphi ahm sabit ho sakate hai

 kendra sarkaar ne aakhir ek saal ke lambey intjaar ke baad deshbhar main apane karmchaariyon ke liye saatven vetan ayog ko puri tarah se hari jhandi dikhaa di he
 The government had constituted the Ashok Lavasa Committee to change the increase in allowances in the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission, which submitted its report to the government after a long gap
 gauratlab he kisatven vetan ayogse vetan main hui badhottaree ko kendra sarkaar ne 1 janvari 2016 le lagu kiya tha
 It was being speculated that the enhanced allowance would be given to the employees from the day it would approve the report of the Lavasa Committee
 haalanki is mudde par kendra sarkaar ne kendriya karmchaariyon ko khush karte hue bhatte kaa arier dene ke liye bhi 1 janvari 2016 kii taarikh tay kar di he
 While this decision has cleared the way for the Central Government employees to get a big benefit, there are some negative aspects for which financial matters, including the Central Reserve Bank, have been informed
 7wein vetan ayog se karmchaariyon kaa phayda kaise badhayegi arthvyavastha1
 The implementation of the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission, on an average 23 in the earnings of about 1 crore central employees and pensioners

 2
 vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne se selary paane vaale karmchaariyon ke paas cash- donon vaastavik or digital main badhottaree hogi
 Its direct benefit will be seen in the form of increase in consumption in the country
 3
 With the increased money, the family is expected to increase demand for homes and vehicles in the country
 bainkon ko ummid he ki is badhati maang se desh main bainkon kii lending badhegi jisase bank adhik kaarobaar or munafa darj kar sakenge

 6
 vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ke lagu hone ke baad selary paa rahe logon kaa kharch badhane se sarkaar ke revenue main bhi ijapha darj hoga
 More money clearly means that people's savings will also increase and this is the biggest strength of the middle class in the economy
 7
 However, there is also a danger of increasing inflation in the country due to high demand for consumer goods
 beete do varshon ke dauraan sarkaar ne mahangaai par lagaam laga rakhaa he
 Due to this, the inflation rising through demand will not be a big problem for the common man and the government
 8
 The Reserve Bank is appealing to all banks to reduce the interest rate on the expectation of a positive impact of the Seventh Pay Commission
 lihaaja ek baar jaise hi kendra sarkaar apane 47 lakh karmchaaree or 53 lakh pensionbhogi ko vetan ayog se hue ijaphe kii rakam pahunchaa degi desh main gaadi, car or home lone saste ho jaaenge

 adhik khapat or adhik maang kaa sidhaa asar desh main nai naukariyon main ijaphe ke taur par dekhne ko milegaa
 This increase in jobs will be seen especially in the manufacturing sector
 ye hai bade vetan or bhatte kaa negative asar1
 The Reserve Bank, in its monetary review released in April, had said that the Central Government exchequer would bear a huge burden on giving increased allowance from the recommendations of the Pay Commission
 iske chalate rigerv bank ne ashanka jaahir kii thi ki desh kii jidipi ko 1 se 1
 Up to 5 percent loss may be incurred
 2
 With this decision, the central government coffers will have to bear the burden of Rs 1,76,071 crore only on paying annual pension to retired central employees
 3
 Implementation of the recommendations of the Pay Commission on allowances will incur an additional expenditure of Rs 29,300 crore on the Central Government exchequer
 4
 After the decision of the Center on the allowance of employees, now almost the states will increase the allowance to the employees of the state at this rate, which will affect the revenue of the states

 Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday reminded the BJP of the formula set in a meeting with Shah ahead of the Lok Sabha elections and said that he had taken a 50-50 formula for an alliance in the state
 shivasena kii is maang to dekhte hue yahaan congress or ensipi bhaajapa kaa kaam bigaadti hui dikh rahi hai
 The Maharashtra Congress on Friday indicated that it may support the Shiv Sena-led government, according to a news agency IANS report
 vahiin, isse ek din pehle isi prakaar kaa prastaav rashtravaadi congress party (rakanpa) ke varisht netaa va purv up mukhyamantri chagan bhujabal va congress ke varisht saansad hossain dalvi dwaara diya gaya tha, aisa shivasena ke sahyogi va sattarudh bhaajapa ko satta se dur rakhane ke liye aayaa he
 With the BJP winning 161 out of 288 seats in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, the saffron alliance has easily crossed the required figure for majority, but this time the bjp's dependence on its alliance partner Shiv Sena is slightly higher because last time where BJP had 122 seats, The bar has only 105 seats in its account
 shivasena kii siton kaa aankada bhi pichhali baar ke mukaable 63 se ghatakar 56 hua he lekin rajg sarkaar kii sthirataa ke liye uski bhoomika mahatvapurn hone vaali he
 At the same time, talk of Congress, it has got 44 seats
 sharad pavaar ke netritv vaali ensipi ko is baar 54 siten mili hai, jo 2014 ke mukaable 13 siten adhik he
 If the Shiv Sena does not agree with the BJP and the congress-ncp supports it, then the tally of seats reaches 154
 yah aankada bahumat se 9 zyada hoga
 However, it is difficult for Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP to come together
 ieenes ne apni report main maharashtra congress ke adhyaksh balasaheb thoraat ne media se kaha, 'ham se is par ab tak shivasena se koi baatcheet nahin hui he
 However, if this happens, we will place it before the party high command for a decision on the matter
 'shivasena adhyaksh thakare ne kaha, 'ham kam siton (bhaajapa ke mukaable) par ladane ko sahamat hue, lekin main har baar bhaajapa ke liye aisa nahin kar saktaa
 i have to take my party forward too
 ' apni varisht sahyogi par nishaanaa sadhate hue shivasena ne apane mukhpatr ‘saamana' main kaha ki nateezon kii ghoshnaa se pehle jaisaa bhaajapa ne daawa kiya tha, vaisaa koi 'maha janadesh” nahin he or nattejey vastav main “satta ke ahankaar” main duube logon par ek chot hai
 Now the bjp's job in Maharashtra is to convince its ally Shiv Sena
 sutron ne kaha ki maharashtra main bhagava gathbandhan ke sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karne se pehle chizon ko antim rup dene ke liye bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke saath baatcheet kar sakate hai
 The BJP Parliamentary Board on Thursday authorized Shah to take all necessary decisions for the formation of a new government in both the states
 vahiin, pitiai kii report ke mutabik maharashtra congress pramukh balasaheb thoraat ne bhaajapa ko satta se dur rakhane ke liye shivasena se haath milaane se inkaar kar diya he
 He said that his party's mandate is to play the role of a responsible opposition
 unhone shuukravaar ko media se kaha ki shivasena nit sarkaar kaa samarthan karne kii congress kii koi ranneeti yaa prastaav nahin he
 Thorat said, "so there is no question of supporting Uddhav Thackeray-led party
 yadi shivasena hamase sampark karti he to ham apane kendriya netritv se salaah maangenge or uskaa faisla antim hoga
 Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar also denied any alliance with the Shiv Sena
 unhone kaha, ‘ham shivasena ke saath nahin jaaenge
 The ncp-congress and other allies will sit together and decide on the future strategy
 ' pavaar ne kaha, ‘logon ne hamase vipaksh main baithne ko kaha he
 The idea of trying to sit in power cannot even come to our mind

 The Uttar Pradesh State Accredited Correspondents Committee (UPSACC) had also expressed anguish over the controversy of Kangana and the journalist and demanded her apology
 bataa den ki 7 july ko kangana ranut ne jajmental he kya film ke gane ke launch ke vakt ek patrkaar par unki film manikarnika ke bare main buree baaten likhane kaa iljaam lagaaya tha
 Kangana claimed that the journalist had personally messaged her and spent 3 hours with her in her vanity van
 patrkaar ne us hi samay kangana ke lagaae sabhi aaropon ko nakaar diya tha
 He told that he and Kangana were together for an interview only a short time and he did not send any message to Kangana
 is maamle ke baad film jajmental he kya kii produsar ekta kapur ne media se maafee maangi thi
 Kangana Ranaut, however, flatly refused to apologize to Patkar, and expressed his displeasure with the group by releasing a video on social media against the media
 iske baad antertenment jarnlists gild ne is bare main shikaayat karte hue bayaan diya tha ki ye pehali baar nahin he jab kangana ranut or unki bahan or manager rangoli ne patrakaron se bura vyavhaar yaa gaali galouj kiya ho
 This thing is now included in Kangana's habit
 iske baad antertenment jarnlists gild ne kangana ko bycott karne kaa elaan kiya tha

 But till the evening of October 2, when the convoy of these farmers stayed in the borders of up-delhi, they had to listen to the demands and also had to agree

 RJD MLA Arun Yadav's difficulties in the popular sex racket in Bihar are increasing
 peedita kii ore se duusari baar court main die gaye 164 ke kalam band bayaan main naam aane ke baad se arun yadav faraar ho gaye hai or police unki giraftaar ke liye lagaataar koshish kar rahi he
 Bhojpur police had also sought permission to place advertisements in the house of absconding MLA Arun Yadav at ADJ-1 RK Singh in Pasco Court
 court ke aadesh ke baad police ab vidhayak ke awaas par ishtehaar kii notice chaspa kar diya he
 In this case, Bhojpur Police Captain Sushil Kumar told that the police is working with full readiness in this matter
 aapako bataa den ki aara kii rahane vaali naaballig kaa soshal media par aapbeetee kaa video viral hone ke baad police ne peedita kaa phir se dobaaraa court main 164 kaa kalam band byaan darj karaayaa he
 Where it is believed that the victim has taken the name of RJD MLA Arun Yadav for wrongdoing with her
 iske pehle bhi naaballig ne vidhayak or ek ejeeniyar kii sanliptata hone kii baat police or court ke samaksh apane bayaan main diya tha
 But at that time it was not clear who the mlas are and from which party
 jiske baad bhojpur police ne sex racket kii sanchalika anitha devi, bacchee ke saath galat kaam karne vaale ejeeniyar amaresh kumaar, dalal sanjit or sex racket kaa sanchaalak sanjay yadav urf jija ko giraftaar kar jail bhej diya tha
 The matter had calmed down for a few days, but as soon as a video of a minor's involvement in the quagmire of a sex racket started becoming increasingly viral on social media, MLA Arun also came in its favor
 bacchee ne viral video main vidhayak koun hai or uske saath kahaan kab galat kaam kiya is sabakaa pole khol kar rakh diya
 Not only this, the victim also accused the police of lynching the case
 viral video par patna mahila vikaas manch ne sangyaan lete hue aara pahunchakar peedita se mulaakaat kii or puure cese kii jaankaree nagar thana main jaakar liya
 After which the police again came into action and again filed a pen-closing statement of 164, along with a non-bailable warrant was issued against the accused MLA from the court on 13 September
 sonakshi sinha jab jawan actaron ke saath kaam karne kii disha main bad rahi hai to aisi bhi ek heroin he jo apni umr se dogune hero ke saath kaam karnaa chaahati he
 25-year-old Prachi Desai will soon be seen in a remake of the south hit film Saami with 53-year-old Sanjay Dutt
 unhone tivi serial kasam se se 17 varsh kii umr main kariyar shuru kiya tha
 Prachi says, "I always wanted to work with a hero older than me
 chaahe vah sanjay hon yaa ajay
 i think the angle of the older man and the young woman makes the plot quite interesting
 '' chaliye, yah bhi ek acha shagal he
 New Delhi: Only the last phase of Lok Sabha election is left and political stirring is in full swing
 aise main sahityakar jagat bhi shant nahin he
 When there was a discussion on the relation between literature and politics, the result was that literature and politics are not companions of each other, nor the following, but they are definitely under each other's influence
 sahityakaron kaa kahana tha ki siyasat samaaj kaa ek abhinn hissaa he or sahitya ko samaaj kaa pratibimb mana jaataa he
 This is why literature and politics have been influencing each other since the beginning
 yahaan sawaal uthta he ki kya aaj sahitya siyasat main apana santulit, rachanaatmak hastkshep kar paa rahaa he? ab sahitya main yaa to dalgat pakshadharata dikhti yaa selective virodh yaa phir ekadam hi nirpeksh ravaiya
 In addition to posting posts on social media in favor and opposition of politicians, how is literature contributing positively to politics? With these and many other such burning questions, under Daryaganj's book sham-iii, 'sahitya and Siyasat: What is your politics? a discussion was held on the subject, in which some well-known and young speakers of the literary world participated
 vaani prakaashan ke karyaalay sthit premchand sabhaagaar main yojit is paricharchaa main vivek mishra, vandana raag, ajit bharti or anushakti singh jaise yuva rachanakaaron ne shirkat kii
 On this occasion, well-known narrator Vivek Mishra said that our writing is our politics
 is par hamen alag se baat karne kii zarurat kya he? hamen bas utprerak dena he, baaqi kaa kaam janata karegi
 Through the left, right, everything remains just tu-tu-main-me, no program is educating the public
 janata ke paas naare hai, vaade hai par use koi uske paas jaagrukta nahin
 With the facts, he told that literature was always an alternative politics, but we have become a political tool
 likhane vaale khud satta centre main tabdeel ho gaye hai
 But every option itself becomes a power center later but it is not possible to raise the voice of marginalization
 gandhi ne isi vichaar ke tahat khud ko satta se alag rakhaa hoga
 R
 es
 s
 , left, aap aadi pehle pressure group kii tarah the, lekin ab vah satta centre he
 And the writer cannot be with any power center
 vivek mishra ke anusaar kisaan kii baat, mazaduron kii baat kisi left, rhite kii baat nahin he
 There is also party politics within the party, under which many leaders like Subhash Chandra Bose were expelled from the Congress and Govindacharya from the BJP
 aam aadmi har haal main khilonaa he
 Literature is also a tool of the same kind of alternative politics
 yadi aapke lekhan main sarokaar nahin to aapkaa lekhan raddi he
 The writer was first honest to himself
 chetavanee ke andaaj main unka kahana tha ki ham satta yaa bazaar ke vigyaapan nahin ho sakate
 It is the work of the litterateur to bring out what is hidden
 sahitya ke sarokaar bahut spasht he
 He works by opening the bandage, not blindfolding
 sahitya kaa itihaas hi yahi kahata ki bhakt ban jaao, prabhu tumhaare uddhaar ke liye aayenge
 That literature was not the voice of the public at that time, it was written in praise of the king
 apni baat ko or bhi spasht karte hue unhone kaha ki ek lekhak niraashaa ke samay apwaad lekar aata, vah lok se nayak gadhata he
 Citing the story of the narrator Sanjeev, crime, Uday Prakash's story Tepchu and the whip of Narendra Nagdev, he told that in these the author is giving a symbol to the society
 ye kahaniyaan aapako apane samay ke liye sajag karti hai
 Giving the conclusion, he said that the work of a writer is not an advertisement for good work of power, he means by the concerns of common people, which is exploited
 main ek libral democrate kii tarah sochataa hoon, main extream left yaa extream rhite hokar nahin sochataa,yuva rachanaakaar ajit bharti ne kaha ki sahityakar kaa raajnneetik vishyon par bolnaa zaruri he, jo bahut kam ho rahaa he
 Catching the frost is not bad, it is natural, it is human but both superstition and superstition are wrong
 vichaardhaara rakhana bura nahin, kutark karnaa zarur bura he
 One kind of ideology is also seen by the tendency to consider progressive by name and degrade the other ideology
 adhikanshtah sahityakar bhi aam janata kii tarah rateric (kaalpanik baton) ko hawa dene main vyast ho jate hai
 i think it is important to have political and social subjects in literature, because that determines our future
 bharti kaa kahana tha ki mujhe apni peedi ke sahityakaron se yah samasya he ki ve raajnneeti se nirpeksh hai, ve kisi bhi mudde par apni raay vyakt nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 Our responsibility as a writer is to express our views so that the public can take a message from it
 jab sahityakar raajnneeti par baat karne se bachane lagata he to vah apane pathak varg or samaaj ke saath dhokhadhadi karata he
 The author is not just to sell the book on social media
 unhone lekhak varg se sawaal kiya ki rape, molestesan jaise muddon par bhi lekhak chup kaise rah jate hai, unki aatma unhen dhikkaarti nahin he? sahitya jo ham rachate hai usamen sirf prem kahaniyaan nahin honi chahie
 We cannot accuse the general public that this is what she wants to study
 sahityakar kii yah zimmedaari he ki vah saamaajik mudde par likhe
 Politics has disappeared from literature
 yah sirf vamapanthiyon kii zimmedaari nahin he ki vah garibon par likhe
 
 sahityakaron ko nishpaksh hokar aise muddon par awaz uthaani chahie jinamein janata kii awaz ho
 Well-known creator Vandana Rag said that literature is always there to create opposition
 samaaj vibhinn ayaamon se bana hota he
 Every litterateur picks up elements according to his mood and writes on them
 meri peedi ke sahityakar bhi aisa sochate ki ve kis pachade main kyon pade, shaayad hamane aisi pidiyon ko taiyaar kiya, jinaki soch is tarah viksit hi nahin hui
 There literature, history, values were left behind and our human values ended
 praathamikta bas achche ankon kii aay hi rah gayi, use hamane isi tarah hi dhaala he ki vah apane jivan main hi ram gaya he
 He said that old writers like Nagarjuna, Dhumil, Dinkar openly wrote in opposition to power
 unhone bataaya ki main jab 70 ke dashak main badi ho rahi thi, tab samaaj itnaa vibhakt nahin hua tha
 There is a phrase going on now - piecemeal knowledge
 jin mulyon ke saath hamane 70 ke dashak se shuruyaat kii thi, unheen mulyon ke saath agar ham chalate to shaayad aaj samaaj itnaa nahin banta hota
 Then we come to the 80s when a suit is presented to us in a different way and suddenly a majority begins to feel threatened by its existence
 raag kaa tark tha ki zaruri yah tha ki ham dharm ko alag kar chalate or apane rajanetaaon se pakad kar poochhate ki yah kis tarah kii vibhed kii bhashaa he
 Who is on the side, the south, the opposition, the left, how can we talk in such a black and white? Why can't a leftist be a friend of a rightist? How are we so divided? How can i be a supporter of the Hinduism that breaks the democratic structure by making one supreme authority great and not talking of marginalization
 unhone sahitya samaaj kii is baat ke liye khinchaai kii or sawaal kiya ki kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ne mahilaon ko is baar samuchit netritv nahin diya
 Why don't we raise these issues on social media in this era of individual worship? Young writer Anushakti Singh said that literature and politics, as soon as this issue comes up, i miss Rashtrakavi Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, written by the first Prime Minister of the country Preface to the book 'four Chapters of Culture'
 khud kai kitaab likh chuke nehru ji kaa sahitya prem koun nahin jaanata
 Not only Dinkar but he was also an admirer of Mahakavi Nirala and Azeem Shire Firaq
 sunne main aata he ki firaaq ne ek baar apni naaraazgi unase kaha tha-tum mukhaatib bhi ho, qareeb bhitumako dekhen ki tumse baat karenor nehru is kuubasurat vyangy par muskura uthe the
 The question arises that the democracy which started so beautiful beautiful and literary environment, why Muktibodh needed to write it there? It is worth mentioning, not a single book of Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh was published in his lifetime
 unke vaqt ke sabase aadarneey aalochakon ne unhen chizophrenik tak qaraar diya tha
 The same Muktibod line resonates in our ears
 is pankti se mujhe gagan gil ke sampadan main chhapi nirmal verma ke aprakashit chitthiyon or diary ke ansh ko sankalit karti kitaab 'sansar main nirmal verma' kaa ek uddhran yaad ho aayaa
 Even during the seventy-eighty-eight years when Indira ji prevailed, used to tighten her eyes on the magazine, and letters such as Dinaman and Dharmyuga were in her praise, Indira ji did not wreak havoc on the books
 kavi or lekhak apni baat apni rachanaaon ke zarie kehete ja rahe the or stuti main leen sahityakaron ko uksaate bhi ja rahe the
 i think the writer should be on the middle path
 use har taraf kii galat baat rakhni chahie
 Character abuse starts from both sides as soon as the left or south goes against their mind
 unka kahana tha ki lekhak kisi duusare duniya se aayaa praani nahin
 The younger generation grew up in the era of liberalization, so it has joined our upbringing
 kuch aise log hai jo kesaria aatankwaad failaate hai, saath hi yah bhi sahi he ki hindu dharm kaa naam lenaa bhi gunaah ho gaya he
 Just like a senior poet has just said that he likes Muslims more than Hindus, such a statement raises the question of a particular class
 indira gandhi ke apatkaal ke samay jab sab lekhak unki vaani bol rahe the to nirmal verma raat kaa reporter jaisi rachana lekar aae
 Senior creators Vinod Bhardwaj, journalist Sanjeev, youth creators Dharyakant Mishra, Manish, Hansraj, Fazal Haq, Sanjeev Sinha, Ankush Kumar etc

 'big bos' ke ghar main 81wein din subah se hi swami om gharavaalon se prarthana karne lage ki ve unhen ghar kaa captain banaaen
 The main match of captaincy was between Bani j and Swami Om
 manu punjabi ne kaha ki vah swami om kaa saath denge vahiin rohan ne kaha ki vah bani ko hi saport karenge
 Swami Om also told Bani that she is like his daughter, so he should help her win
 haalanki bani ne unhen puri tarah se ignor kar diya
 In the evening, 'bigg Boss' introduced the Captaincy Task for which he appointed Manveer as the Director
 ghar ke garden aria main do tablon main chote-chote dibbon se do pyramid banaae gaye the
 One was of Pyramid Bani and the other was that of Swami Om
 task ke anusaar gharavaale jis sadsy ko ghar kaa captain nahin bananaa chaahate unhen unke pyramid ko ball se giraanaa tha
 In the end the participant whose pyramid is in a much better position will become the captain of the house
 rohan baar baar bani ko kehane lage ki vah bani ke saath hai, is par manavir ko gussa aa gaya ki unhen baar-baar yah kehane kii kya jarurat he
 At the same time, Lopa also tried to convince Rohan that the other people of the house are also supporting Bani and Rohan should not say so
 jab gharavaalon ne swami om ke sabhi box gira die tab vah khud teble ke upar baith gaye or kehane lage ki vah apana pyramid dobaaraa nahin bananaa chaahate hai
 Manveer and Manu ask him to continue the task but this has no effect on him
 tippaniyan Then as soon as 'bigg Boss' announced only 10 minutes left for the task, Swami Om got up from the table and took out something from a container and started spraying it on Rohan and Bani
 unhone kaha ki vah unka peshaab he
 This act of Swami Om enraged all the family members and he was immediately jailed
 gharavaalon ne unhen jamkar kharikhoti sunai vahiin rohan kaa gussa foot padaa
 Bigg Boss gave instructions to the family members not to get close to Swami Om nor to talk to him

 At the same time, Lopamudra started saying that the family members should have acted in peace during the whole incident and she was preventing everyone from going to them but no one was listening to them
 is par bani ne kaha ki jab aap gusse main hote hai to aapako samaj nahin aata ki kya sahi he or kaise rahanaa chahie
 Everyone believed that Swami Om should be evicted from home

 On the other hand, Swami Om was busy justifying his action that there was only water in that vessel
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki yadi usamen ureen hota to bhi usase koi mar nahin jaataa or unhone koi niyam nahin todaa he
 Tomorrow we will see that for the first time in the history of 10 seasons of 'bigg Boss', guards sent inside the house to evacuate a contestant
 iske baad jaise hi 'big bos' ne task ke liye keval 10 minute bache hone kii ghoshnaa kii swami om teble se uthe or ek container se kuch nikaalkar rohan or bani par chhidakane lage
 He said that she is his urine
 swami om kii is harakat se sabhi gharavaale gusse main aa gaye or unhen turant jail main band kiya gaya
 The family members heard him fiercely while Rohan's anger broke out
 'big bos' ne gharavaalon ko nirdesh die ki ve swami om ke kareeb na jaaen or na hin unase baat karen

 com / elopgt8xbj — Bigg Boss (@biggboss) January 5, 2017 This time all the householders were unanimous that Swami Om has crossed all his limits
 vahiin lopamudra kehane lageen ki puri ghatana ke dauraan gharavaalon ko shanti se kaam lenaa chahie tha or vah sabko unke paas jane se roak rahi thim lekin koi unki baat nahin sun rahaa tha
 Bani said that when you are angry, you do not understand what is right and how you should live
 sabhi kaa yahi maananaa tha ki swami om ko ghar se nikaala janaa chahie
 Bigg Boss called all the family members in the living area and said that Swami Om's actions are highly condemnable and he has tried to lower the level of the show
 vahiin duusari taraf swami om apni harakat ko justiphi karne main lage the ki us bartan main keval pani tha
 However, he also said that even if there was urin in it, no one would die from it and he had not broken any rules
 kal ham dekhenge ki 'big bos' ke 10 sijanon ke itihaas main pehali baar kisi pratibhaagi ko ghar se nikaalane ke liye ghar ke andar bheje gaye gards

 france ke nausainik bede ke jahaajon ne atlantic ke garbh main samaa chuke air france ke '447 udaan' ke blike baks se signal praapt kiya he
 According to the news published in the French newspaper Le Monde on Tuesday, yesterday a small investigative submarine named 'nautile' dived to search for 'black Box' after French ships received 'very weak signal' from the aircraft recorders
 yah spasht nahin he ki yah signal vimaan ke data ricorder se aayaa tha yaa vaayas ricorder se
 Both devices, called 'black boxes', can be helpful in determining what happened to the crashed aircraft
 gauratlab he ki 31 may ko air france kaa yah vimaan durghatnagrast ho gaya tha
 Officials of the French Army and the French Naval Institute operating this small naval fleet have no immediate comment about this report
 sainikon ke saath-saath 10,000 se zyada agnishmankarmi madhya rus ke jangalon main lagi aag bujhane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The situation created by this fire, which has become a threat to nearly 200 villages and cities, has been described by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as 'scary'
 neshnal centre for chrysis sichuations ke pramukh general bladimir stepanov ne putin kii adhyakshata main hui ek baithak main kaha ki jangal main lagi aag roosi kshetra ke voronese, moscow or nizani novgorode ke alaava republic of mordovia :volga kshetra: ke 200 gaanvon ke liye khatra ban gayi he
 This hastily convened meeting was called to take stock of the situation arising out of the forest fire
 aag ne ab tak 77 gaanvon or shaharon ko raakh ke dher main tabdeel kar diya he or isse 30 log kaal ke gaal main samaa chuke hai
 Senior RSS leader MG Vaidya has reacted sharply to the suggestion of Sushma Swaraj for the post of Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki main nahin sochataa ki 2013 se pehle bijepi pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karegi
 Actually, in the British era, the Leader of the Opposition was automatically considered as the prime ministerial candidate, but India does not have such a method
 isiilie is maamle par shivasena supremeo kaa bayaan arthhin he
 Earlier, the Shiv Sena ran a new bet, replacing Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar as Prime Ministerial candidates, in which Sushma Swaraj was best qualified for the post of Prime Minister
 unke is bayaan ne bhaajapa main hi ek tarah se khalabali machaa di thi
 In fact, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray on Sunday praised Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sushma Swaraj and said that she would be the most suitable as the next Prime Minister of the country
 isse pehle pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko bhi kinare lagaate hue shivasena ne ek nayaa daanv chalaa tha, jisamen sushamaa swaraj ko pradhanmantri pad ke liye sabase yogya bataaya tha
 His statement created a panic in the BJP itself
 darasal, shiv sena pramukh bal thakare ne ravivaar ko bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) netaa sushamaa swaraj kii prashansa kii thi or kaha tha ki desh ke agle pradhanmantri ke rup main vah sabase upyukt hongi
 The incident of violence with Dalit youth in Una has created an uproar from the road to the Parliament
 itane bade paimaane par viral hue maamle ko vakt rahete sambhala ja saktaa he
 The Anandiben Patel government of Gujarat has been cited as a major reason for lagging behind on many fronts
 anandi ben sarkaar kii laaparvaahiyon kii vajah se maamle kavideo deshbhar main faillaur uske baad hangaame kii vajah bana
 The video again brought a major political issue to the BSP in the state
 aaie jaanate hai, kahaan-kahaan chuki anandi ben sarkaar-- gaurakshakon ke jariye daliton ko pite jane ke baad jab video viral hone laga tab sarkaar ne is par koi thos kadam nahin uthaaya
 On the second day, when the Dalit groups came together to encircle the police station, the government went into action and ordered the police to take action against the accused
 iske baad paanch gaurakshakon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 - The video of Dalits being killed near the police station went viral
 lagbhag har maamle kii tarah is maamle main bhi police kii lachar style ek baar phir vivaad ke centre main rahi
 If the police took tough steps on the same day i
e
 July 11, then the issue would not have caught so much
 -sarkaar kii chookis morche par bhi dikhi ki maamla samvedansheel hone ke baavjood shuru se hi is par najar nahin rakhi ja saki
 If action was taken immediately by sensing the matter, the issue would not have become a sore throat for the government
 - shuruyaat main sarkaar ise jhadap kaa aam maamla hi maan rahi thi
 Because of this, first announced compensation of 4 lakh to the victims
 5 pramukh aropiyon ko giraftaar kiya
 However, its information was not passed on to any media or Dalit community leaders
 - ek hafte baad jab mayawati ne is maamle ko rajyasabha main uthaaya tab jaakar sarkaar harakat main ai
 In a hurry, the government took action and arrested 7 people
 is maamle kii puri jaanch siaidi krime ko saunpi gai
 Not only this, in 60 days the case was filed in the special court by filing a charge sheet
 isaki ghoshnaa bhi kar di gai
 - Many government announcements came too late
 vaise dekha jaae to jis tarah kii ghatana thi, isamen or zyada sarkari karrwai kii kya ummid kii ja sakati he, lekin ab is mudde ne atyaachaar or insaaf se hatakar siyasat kii shakl le lee
 Due to the delay in the government announcement, the Dalit groups also got time and the political party became active
 jiske chalate in aath dinon main dalit atyaachaar maamle ne rajnatik swarup le liya tha
 In this incident on 11 July, it took 9 days for the head of the state Anandiben Patel to meet the victim's family and the victims
 darasal peedito se milane kaa faisla bhi tab hua jab aam aadmi party ke arvind kejariwal ore congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii ore se oona jane kaa elaan kiya gaya
 In particular, it has been seen that the KJJP government is always sensitive to the issue of cow slaughter
 police jahaan gaay ko katlakhaane jane se roak nahin paati, vahaan ab tak dekha gaya he ki gaurakshak hi is tarah ke logon ko pakadaney main aage hote hai
 The government has never taken any action against such guards
 kyonki har baar pakade jate logon main duusare sampradaay ke log hote hai
 Which gives the benefit of vote bank to the BJP government as a whole
 yah bhi sarkaar kii niskriyata ke liye badi vajah maani jaati he
 Former Finance Minister and Congress leader p Chidambaram on Monday targeted the BJP
 unhone kaha ki modi sarkaar kii 'prashasnic aakshamata' or 'nitigat chook' ke chalate desh main krishi sankat, berogari or arthvyavastha kii samasya khadi hui he
 The senior Congress leader said, 'the farmers' disappointment has turned into anger and they have taken to the streets to protest
 ' unhone bhartiya arthvyavastha se jude kai muddon par baat karte hue bhaajapa kii ninda kii
 Chidambaram said that informal price is the main reason for low wages of agricultural produce and agricultural labor
 emspi (nunatam samarthan mulya) paryaapt nahin he
 Every farmer knows that the promise of 50% of the MSP cost is just a jumla
 chidambaramane is dauraan arabiai kii us report kaa bhi zikr kriya, jisamen bataaya gaya he ki 48 fisadi log maanate hai ki arthvyavastha kii haalat pichley 12 maheenon main badtar hui he
 Accusing the government, he also said that unemployment has increased in the country, which is completely different from bjp's promise of providing two crore jobs in a year
 chidambaram ne yah bhi sawaal uthaaya coctober-disambar 2017ke liye shram beuro ke surveykshan ko jari kyon nahin kiya gaya? chidambaram ne kaha ki notebandi ke kaaran 2015-16 main vikaas dar 8
 6 in 2017-18, down from 2 percent
 7 pratishat rah gai
 Tamil Nadu government has officially acknowledged that 50,000 small business units closed in the state during 2017-18
 paanch lakh naukariyaan chhin gayi or emsamai kshetra main puunjigat nivesh main 11,000 karod rupee kii giravat ai he
 Chidambaram said that business continues to be affected due to the erratic Goods and Services Tax (GST)
 unhone kaha ki saamaajik suraksha kanoonon or kaaryakramon ko bhaajapa kii aguwai vaali centre sarkaar ne upekshit kiya he
 Along with this, he said that the Food Security Act was also not implemented
 bamushkil 30 fisadi kisaanon ko hi fasal beemaa kaa laabh mil rahaa he
 This is unexpected for insurance companies
 vahi swasthya suraksha yojana bhi keval jumala he

 Know what the MP said in the discussion in Rajya Sabha
 
 
 rajani patil ne manuaadi vichaardhaara ko kosarajyasabha main charchaa kii shuruyaat congress saansad rajani patil ne kii
 He said that the state government, knowing everything, did not make enough arrangements on the day of Vijay Utsav

 Sharad Pawar appealed for peace, while NCP President Sharad Pawar said that Vijay Utsav has been celebrated there for 200 years
 unhone kaha ki pichley 50 varshon main meri jaankaree ke mutabik vahaan kabhi bhi koi vaakia nahin hua
 In such a situation, some communal elements are trying to spoil the atmosphere of Maharashtra
 nyaayik jaanch kii maang karte hue unhone kaha ki isamen jald se jald kaarywahi ho
 Appealing not to do politics on this, Sharad Pawar said that what happened has happened, now i appeal to all people to maintain peace

 jisko turant rokna chahie
 Sanjay Rawat said - The leader of the invisible forces behind the incident, Sanjay Rawat gave a new twist to the whole issue and said that there is an invisible hand behind the incident
 jo divide and rule kii policy ke tahat logon kii bhaawanaaon ko bhadakaane or samaaj ko baantne kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 Praising the state government, he said that the government has taken appropriate action on the spot
 political linching band hotrunmul congress ke netaa nadeem ulahak ne kaha ki jagah jagah daliton kii pitayee ho rahi he
 Minority is not protected
 yah political linching band honi chahie or is puure masale kii nishpaksh rup se karrwai honi chahie
 bjp's parallel organization behind it, Samajwadi Party leader Naresh Aggarwal said that since the BJP government is in power, all the bjp's parallel organizations have started considering themselves as the government
 is masale par ek kamishan of inquayri gathit hona chahie jo nishpaksh rup se jald se jald jaanch kare
 BJP MP Amar Shankar Sabale, dragging the names of Jignesh Mevani and Omar Khalid, said that he has given provocative speeches and incited the riots
 grahamantri rajnath singh de sakate hai bayaanis masale par grih mantri rajnath singh sadan ke patal par apana bayaan denge
 Significantly, on Wednesday, there was a ruckus in the Lok Sabha Rajya Sabha on this issue several times and the opposition parties were constantly demanding discussion
 vitt mantri pranav mukherjee dwaara shuukravaar ko pesh aam bajet ko lekar bhaajapa ne aarope lagaaya ki yah bajet amiron or shaktisampann logon par shaayad hi koi boj daalata he lekin isane kamjor aam aadmi par gaharaa aghat kiya he
 The party said that it would bring a cut motion in Parliament against the provisions of this budget
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa or purv vitt mantri yashavanth sinha ne kaha ki is bajet se upabhoktaaon par lagbhag 50 hajaar karod rupaye kaa boj badhegaa or chunki hamaari aabaadi kaa ek chota sa hissaa hi iskar adaa karata he isliye iskaa bhaar puri aabaadi ko vahan karnaa padega
 He said that increasing the prices of petroleum products will also have a huge impact on the prices of all other products and inflation will go up more than before
 unhone kaha ki bajet main thope gayi karon kaa boj abhootpurv he or yah pehle se lagi mahangaai kii lapaton ko or bhadkaayegaa
 Priyanka Gandhi took part in the strategy session of the state Congress leaders on Monday for the first time amid a ruckus in the ruling Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh
 congress mahasachiv gulam nabi aaazaad dwaara bulaai gai yah baithak ek ghante tak chali, jahaan priyanka gandhi ne pradesh congress adhyaksh raaj babbar, congress ke mukhyamantri pad kii ummidavaar shila dikshit or prachaar pramukh sanjay singh samet pradesh netaaon se baatcheet kii
 Party spokesman RPN Singh said that this is the first time that Priyanka Gandhi has participated in such a meeting of leaders of Uttar Pradesh
 uttar pradesh main agle saal ke shuru main chunaav hone hai
 In this meeting some state leaders suggested to tie up with smaller parties like RLD and Peace Party
 kuch netaaon ne samarthan jutaney ke liye yatraaen nikaalane kii bajaae prakhand str par baithken karne kii vakaalat kii
 Currently, the impact of Rahul Gandhi's messaging visits to all districts of Uttar Pradesh was also discussed
 vaise party kii brifing main singh in sawaalon ko taal gaye ki priyanka gandhi amethi aurrayabareli loksabhakshetron ke baahar bhi chunaav prachaar karengi yaa nahin
 In the last assembly elections, he confined himself to these areas
 singh kaa in sawaalon par kahana tha, ‘yadi ham faisla un par hi chhod den to behatar hoga
 When asked why the Congress, which projected itself as a democratic party, leaves such decisions to the family, they still had a similar answer
 uttar pradesh ke congress netaa purajor maang karte rahe hai ki priyanka rajya main party sanghathan main jaan foonkane ke liye chunaav prachaar main badi bhoomika nibhaaen
 The Congress has been out of power in the state for 27 years

 In Modi wave, BJP captured 73 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main congress 403 main se mahaj 28 seat hi jeet pai thi

 gujarat hoicourt ne rajya sarkaar ke us purv aadesh ko vaid tehra diya he, jiske dwaara sarkaar ne nijee skulon kii fees ko regulate kiya tha
 That is, now private schools can not keep fees more than the limit fixed by the government
 is aadesh se privet skulon ke management ko tagada jhata laga he, lekin isse abhibhavak kaaphi khush hai
 The court upheld the government's fee control law and said that all private schools will have to comply with this law
 chote bacchon ke abhibhavakon ke liye in skulon kii badhati fees or mahangi shiksha sabase badi samasya thi
 It was the first school fees act introduced to curb private schools in the country
 gujarat sarkaar ko mili is safalataa ke baad ab duusare rajyon main aise prayaas kiye ja sakate hai
 Kejriwal of Delhi and Yogi Government of UP have also started efforts in this direction
 court ne privet skool association kii ore se daayar kii gai kanun par roak lagane ke liye yachika ko bhi khaarij kar diya he
 Naresh Rawal, president of the guardian board, Ahmedabad, said, “this is the biggest relief for the Gujarat High Court
 privet skulon dwaara abhibhavak hajaaron, lakhon rupee kaa fees lene se abhibhavak kaaphi pareshaan the
 After a lot of protest, the Gujarat government took this step and created a new law in the assembly according to which the fee limit was fixed for all private schools
 iske mutabik primary skool ke liye adhiktam fees 15,000 rupee, secondary skool ke liye 25,000 rupee or hair secondary skool ke liye 27,000 rupee ho sakati he
 Private schools in Gujarat had filed a petition in the court against this Kanun, which was rejected by the court on Wednesday
 yahi nahin, court ne privet skulon ko ye bhi aadesh diya he ki jinascoolne 2017-18 ke shiksha satr main zyada fees lee unke abhibhavakon ko fees lautaani hogi
 Schools that do not comply with this law may be rejected

 'jati nichi nahin hoti, soch nichi hoti he, karm neeche hote hai
 
 
 ', This clarified statement of Rahul Gandhi is for Narendra Modi, and its background is of' Modi vs Gandhi family '
 amethi main modi ne jab rajeev gandhi samet gandhi parivaar kii teen pidiyon ko nishaanaa banaaya to priyanka ne 'neech raajnneeti' vaala bayaan jari kiya
 Modi linked 'low politics' to 'low caste'
 jativaadee raajnneeti ke maidan main modi ke daanv ko dekhakar baari rahul ke palatwaar kii thi, so, unhone kar diya
 In the beginning opinion was made about Rahul Gandhi's statements that he does not know how to speak
 yaa yun kah len ki unamem raajnneetik bhashaa kii gaharaai nahin he
 From the achievements of the UPA government to the cry of the Congress's secular ideology
 
 
 bas vah kuch hi baton ko doharaate rahete hai
 They do not have the stock of language to be used as an effective weapon for political attack
 rahul ko lekar yah dharna bani to iske peeche kai kaaran rahe
 Rahul has been raised in a completely different environment
 daadi indira gandhi bhi pradhanmantri thim or unke baad pita rajeev gandhi bhi
 By the time his father was killed, Rahul had barely seen 20 spring days
 phir vah daur aayaa, jab maa sonia gandhi raajnneeti se dur raheen, lekin congress kii raajnneeti ke centre main bani raheen
 The depression of the husband's murder and the concern for the future of the children kept the political personality in them under control
 parivaar apane main simata rahaa
 Rahul studied both at home and abroad
 vah jab desh main hote the, tab bhi suraksha ke kade ghere main hote the
 All in all, he got the opportunity to 'get away' from the common people of the country, his life, his living, his needs, two-four
 jab vah raajnneeti main utre to apni maa or 10, janpath ke aasapaas ke netaaon kii naseehat-salaah hi unki raajnneetik samaj thi, jabaki duusari ore modi jaise netaa salonsaal tak us saamaajik parivesh se jujhate rahe, jo raajnneeti ke kendra main hota he
 modi-rahul cannot be compared because of Modi's experiences as a Sangh pracharak and chief minister
 lekin varsh 2014 kii ladaai main kyonki ye donon chehre aamane-saamne hai, isliye modi-rahul kii tulana har str par hone lagi
 Modi's socio-political experience is an advantage for him, so his circle is different, while Rahul seems to be confined to a different realm
 varsh 2004 main jab rahul pehali baar amethi se saansad bane to isliye nahin ki unhen amethi kii janata ke paas jaakar unase samvaad sthapit karnaa padaa, unki baaten sunani padin or unhe vot dene ke liye taiyaar karnaa padaa, balki isliye ki amethi dashakon se gandhi parivaar kaa garh rahaa he
 Sonia gave this seat to the son, and the son won
 saansad ke taur par rahul ne koi sakriyata nahin dikhaai
 The high status of the Gandhi family's political status continued to act as a shield for him
 vah sahuuliyat ke daayre main hi rahe
 Remained silent even in Parliament
 jab vah vipaksh ke nishane par aane lage to unki sakriyata badi
 Everyone will remember his departure on UP
 jab unhone logon ke bich ghoomana shuru kiya, gaanv-dehaat va kasbon ko dekhnaa shuru kiya to vahaan se chizon ko uthaanaa bhi shuru kiya
 This was his practical school of politics
 dikkat yah thi ki apni paariwarik prishthbhumi or parvarish ke kaaran jaanane-samajhane kii jo unki duniya thi, or jinke bich vah raajnneeti karne nikle, un donon main baari antar tha
 Well, when he started meeting the common man, he also came to know their happiness and sorrow
 vah gaanv-dehaat kii bhashaa se bhi parichit hone lage, use pick karne kii koshish bhi karne lage
 But since he was not well versed in that language, when he spoke, he started producing less seriousness and more humor
 sansad main bolte hue jab unhone kalavati kaa udaarahan diya to yaad hoga ki kaise uskaa asar satahi sabit hua
 Barring a few occasions, Rahul's speeches were also seen to produce dullness
 unke bayaan kai baar surkhiyon main isliye bhi rahe ki 'ap-tu-da-mark' nahin maane gaye
 If it means what he thinks in order to convert Rahul's status into a big political figure, then it matters more than how he speaks, and in which language he puts his thinking
 varsh 2014 ke chunaav prachaar ke dauraan rahul ne na sirf bhartiya janajivan ke alag-alag pahaluon ko chune kii koshish kii, balki sidhe unase samvaad sthapit karne kaa ek customiod tarika nikaala
 From rickshaws to coolies, from big cities to women from remote villages, they talked the most
 is tarah kii koshishon par beshak kai tarah ke sawaal uthaae ja sakate hon, lekin in sab se rahul ko apni raajnneetik samaj ko majbooti dene main zarur madad mili hogi
 Some are learning it themselves, some is also teaching them time
 maa ne, jo apane bete ko pradhanmantri dekhnaa chaahati he, bhi kaaphi mehnat kii hogi ki rahul raajnneetik bhashaa kii gaharaai ko pakaden, taaki vah na sirf apane, apni party or sarkaar par lagane vaale aaropon kaa sateek bhashaa main jawaab de saken, balki apane bayanon se virdohi dalon par dhardaar hamalaa bhi bol saken
 'caste is not low, but thinking is low, actions are down
 
 
 ', yah beshak choti-si baangi ho, jisane badi hedlins bana deen, lekin yah rahul kii gahari hoti raajnneetik bhashaa kaa namoona he
 The same language over which Rahul's younger sister Priyanka has the right
 yaad hoga, varsh 2009 kaa vah lamhaa, jab modi ne congress ko sava sau saal puraani party kahkar sambodhit kiya tha
 When Priyanka was asked about this, she questioned the reporters, 'do i look old to you!' desh chhodkar britain main ja based ipel ke purv kamishnar lalit modi se landan main hi poochtacha kii ja sakati he
 The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has made a written application to the British administration under the Mutual Assistance Treaty (MLAT)
 times of india kii khabar ke mutabik, idi ne britain ko likhaa he ki unki jaanch team ko landan main hi lalit modi se poochtacha kaa intjaam kiya jaae
 The ED is investigating against Lalit Modi in a money laundering case
 modi ko bharat laane kii koshishon main lage idi ne emelti samjhaute ke tahat britain jaakar maamle kii jaanch kaa faisla kiya he
 After this case, the police can also take further action in the case of Lalit Modi
 bharat or britain ke bich 1995 main hua emelti kararidi ne britain main apane samakaksh praadhikaran ke liye grih mantralay ke jariye aavedan bhijwane kii koshish kii he
 The Home Ministry will consider sending this application to the UK
 emeltido yaa adhik deshon ke bich ek samjhauta he
 Under this, information is exchanged between countries in criminal cases
 bharat ne britain ke saath saal 1995 main is samjhaute par dastakhat kiya tha
 There is also a case of breaking FEMA rules on Lalit Modi, in addition to ED money laundering against Lalit Modi, violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) is going on in the ED
 saal 2014 main bijepi netaaon jinamein rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kaa bhi naam he ke saath najdiki ke khulaase ke badalalit modiphir charchaa main aae the
 Supporters of Narendra Modi had also reached during the IPL match between Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Daredevils and raised slogans in support of the bjp's prime ministerial candidate
 ‘modi four piem’ ke sandesh vaali kesaria rang kii topi pahane hue lagbhag 400 modi samarthak puure stadium main baithe the or ve shuru se hi 'modi- modi' ke naare laga rahe the
 a supporter, Ravi said, "we have come here to cheer Modi because he is going to become Prime Minister
" modi ke ek anya samarthak ne kaha, jab dilli dairedevills ke captain ne toss jeeta to hamane ‘modi modi’ kahkar unka samarthan kiya
 We were supporting him (modi) even when there was disruption due to rain
 jab royles ke ballebaaj ne pehla chaukaa jamaaya yaa unhone wicket ganvaaya tab bhi ham apane netaa kii jayakaar kar rahe the
 New time demands new tools
 digital or saamaajik yatharth ne jin nai sachchaaiyon ko janm diya he, unase saamana nahin karne vaale kii sthiti kamjor ho jaati he
 New rules of life are strict and include technology interfaces
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne is sachai ko usee vakt sweekaar kar liya, jab unhone party pramukh kaa pad grahan kiya
 The characteristic of Amit Shah's style of struggle is to communicate directly with the workers, identify and contact the voters
 isse bhi aage jo khaas baat he, vah he matadaataaon ko matdaan centre tak laana
 This two-tier activity is best executed by Shah and his activists who have used Prime Minister Narendra Modi's huge image of the Hindu heart emperor with full efficiency and power
 is model kii anukriti main congress matadaataaon se sidhe judane ke liye vishaal sankrendit samaaj, bharat main gahare se gaharaai kii taraf gai
 The party started the booth program to make maximum use of resources, focusing on voters and activists
 congress jaanati he ki bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah is formet ke purodha hai
 He is known for destroying this art of warfare in his own style and has taken the giant leader and his huge message to a new level
 aise main haal ke vidhansabha chunaav is jang kii kadi pariksha the, jahaan congress ne apane nae madul or model kaa pareekshan kiya or kam se kam teen hindu hartland rajyon main vijayi hokar nikali
 This new model has been named Operation Shakti and is now being worked on everywhere
 amit shah or congress ke data vishleshan kaa kaam sanbhaalane vaale purv nivesh banker praveen chakravarti ke bich kii jang ab do lakh matdaan kendron par data ke vaigyanik istemaal ke saath ladi jaaegi
 Originally, elections are now going to be local and the role that television played in history has been on social media since 2014 and beyond
 haal tak congress kii puraani peedi jise bakawaas maanati thi, uttar or madhya ke teen rajyon main digital upkarnon ke istemaal or data vishleshan ke concept se hasil uplabdhi ke pramaan ne 24, akbar road kii maansikta badal di he
