 While fast growth will bring good days for the common man, a good monsoon will determine fast economic growth
 lihaaja achche dinon ke liye acha monsoon behad ahm he or beete 3 saal ke barish ke aankade bataa rahe hai ki monsoon lagaataar modi sarkaar kii madad kar rahaa he
 In the last three years, the Reserve Bank has cut interest rates 4-5 times but still did not see good days
 vahiin modi sarkaar ke pehle do saal ke dauranummid se kam barishne or desh ke kai hisson main sookhe kii sthiti ne bhi achche dinon ko najadik nahin fatakane diya
 In such a situation, will the Meteorological Department now take more than average rainfall for the country on good days
 ab kya arthvyavastha par monsoon kaa centement itnaa baari padataa he ki uske kamjor rahane par aarthik aankade girane lag jate hai or jaise hi ausat se acchhee barish ke sanket mili sabakuch acha lagane lagata he
 After all, the expectation of a good monsoon starts to show
 monsoon kii ummid par bhaag rahaa share bazaaraal main mausam vibhaag ne anumaan jari kiya ki maujuuda saal monsoon ke lihaaj se acha rahegaa
 And most parts of the country will see above average rain
 is khabar ne beete kuch maheenon main share bazaar or urja di or vah pehle tees hajaar ke jaadui aankade ko paar karne main safal rahaa or mausam vibhaag kii haalia report ke baad ko 31 hajaar ke jaadui str ke paar nikal gaya
 Actually, on the expectation of good rain and good harvest as a result, the stocks of auto, infrastructure and banking sector start buying heavily
 gauratlab he ki desh main 1 june se monsoon kii dastak dekhne ko milti he or saamaanya chaal par agle 15 dinon main puraa desh monsoon kii chapet main aa jaataa he
 This time, the monsoon has knocked on the coastal areas of Kerala on June 30 and has confirmed the meteorological department's forecast of good monsoon
 kharif buaai ke liye banpar taiyaaridesh main monsoon ke saath-saath kharif buaai shuru ho jaati he
 This estimate of the Meteorological Department has brought great relief for the farmers who are waiting for kharif sowing in the country
 lagaataar beete do saal se kamjor monsoon ne unhen maayusi ke sivaae kuch nahin diya he
 Now, better-than-average rainfall is raising his hopes that he will be able to recover his losses of the last two years by producing well in the kharif season
 mahangaai par lagati he lagamgauratlab he ki desh main ausat se behatar barish se kharif paidaavaar ko phayda miltaa he
 Food prices in the country remain under control
 sasta anaaj kharidne se logon ke paas anya jaruri kharidari ke liye paryaapt dhan sanchit ho jaataa he
 Hence, this news starts to shine on the face of the farmers from now on and on the expectation of good income, he puts his full strength in kharif sowing
 sasta ho jayega karbehaal hi main rigerv bank ne apnimaudrik niti kii samikshakarte hue kaha ki behatar monsoon ke aagaaj par byaaj daron main katautee kii sambhaavna bad jaaegi
 In such a situation, the coming months of the Meteorological Department will prove to be important for the decision of the Reserve Bank on interest rates
 gauratlab he ki jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki byaaj daron main or katautee arthvyavastha main jaruri teji laane ke liye ahm he
 This step of the Reserve Bank will make the loan in the country cheaper and along with the businessmen, the common man will try to take more and more loans from the banks
 auto sector ko achche cell kii ummircchhi fasal or kaarobaari teji kaa sidhaa asar aam aadmi kii bachat par padataa he
 On one hand, while his earnings increase, his expectations of showing an increase in savings also increase due to the inflation of essential food items
 jaankaron ke mutabik kisi bhi desh main auto sector ke liye yah sabase mahatvapurn samay rahata he jab vahaan kaa aam aadmi do pahiyaa, chaar pahiyaa, commercial motor samet kheti main kaam aane vaale tractor kii kharid par jor detaa he
 a good monsoon is expected to avert the slowdown in these companies for some time
 ab opinian pole par raajnneetik ghamaasan much gaya he
 The Congress and many of its allies have strongly advocated banning it, calling the opinion poll as 'gorakhdhandha', 'tamasha' and 'fabrication'
 vahiin, bijepi ne kaha he ki aisa karnaa na to sanvaidhanik rup se sweekaar kiye jane yogya he, na hi jaruri he, kyonki yah abhivyakti kii swatantraaa kaa hissaa he
 Not only BJP, but his ally Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party has also demanded a ban on opinion polls
 rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) bhi bain ke paksh main he
 Apart from the BSP, SP leader Azam Khan has also said, 'we do not say that the media is wrong, but the opinion poll has no meaning
 ' haalanki neshnal conference ke saansad mehboob beg ne kaha ki in par bain to nahin lagaaya ja saktaa, lekin bahut se pole galat hote hai
 The BJP said that the Congress is opposing it because it is scared of Narendra Modi, as the opposition party is projected to gain in these surveys
 gauratlab he ki pichley kuch samay se ho rahe lagbhag sabhi opinian pole bijepi ko badhat dikhaa rahe hai, khaastaur par modi ke paksh main ja rahe hai
 However, the Congress has said that they are not afraid of Modi
 chunaav surveykshanon par pratibandh lagane sambandhi congress netaaon kii saarvajanik bayaanbaji aise samay ai he jab kuch din pehle hi congress ne chunaav ayog ko patr likhakar chunaav ke dauraan aise surveykshanon ke prakaashan evam prasar par roak lagane kii maang kii
 The Congress has said that such surveys are 'flawed', 'non-indulgent' and 'concocted'
 digvijay singh ne kaha- majaak ban gaya heparty mahasachiv digvijay singh ne kaha, ‘yah to majaak ban gaya he
 It should be banned completely
 jis tarah kii shikaayatein evam suchnaayen mili he, usase pataa chalata he ki koi bhi paise dekar apni icchaanusaar surveykshan kara saktaa he
 How can a few thousand people estimate the trend in a country of 125 billion people? It has become a fraud
 kai aise samooh saamne aaye hai
 Let us know that there is currently a ban on opinion polls from 48 hours before the voting
 opinian pole kai baar managasaint hote hai: rajeev shuklakendriya mantri or varisht congress netaa rajeev shukla ne alag se kaha ki opinian pole kai baar managasaint hote hai isliye, party ne uskaa virodh kar acha hi kiya he
 He said, 'if there are real opinion polls then no one has any problem but the kind of news we are getting now shows that they are concocted
 sabhi log opinian pole lekar saamne aa rahe hai
 He said, "of course, when media starts doing publicity, people are influenced by it
 atev, yah party kii sahi maang rahi he
 There should be a neutral mind before the poll
 ’bijepi ke arun jetali ne kaha, pratibandh kyoryshumaari par pratibandh sambandhi maang kaa virodh karte hue bijepi ke varisht netaa arun jetali ne kaha ki bharat main chunaav vishleshan abhi paripakvata hasil hi kar rahaa he tathaa ho saktaa he ki kuch opinayan pole galat ho jaaen lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin ki un par pratibandh laga diya jaae
 Jaitley said in an article released by the BJP, 'opinion polls are taking place
 kuch ne vishwasaneeyata hasil kar lee he jabaki kuch ko aasaani se nazarandaaj kiya ja saktaa he
 Whether these polls have credibility or not, can they be banned
 ’ unhone kaha ki raajnneetik dal tab in opinian pole ko khaarij karne kii maang karte hai jab ve unke pratikul hote hai
 Normally the one who is at a disadvantage demands a ban, while the one who is in profit is in favor of continuing it
 jetali ne kaha, 'aise pole par pratibandh par is aadhaar par nahin vichaar kiya ja saktaa he ki koun aisi maang uthaa rahaa he
 Clearly (opinion) poll is part of freedom of expression
 unpar pratibandh lagaana na to sanvaidhanik rup se ijaajat yogya he, na hi vaanchhneeya
 In several recent opinion polls, bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi has been told ahead of Rahul Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi is being seen as the Congress's prime ministerial candidate
 vidhansabha chunaavon par opinian pole ke anusaar bijepi madhya pradesh, rajasthan, evam chhattisgarh main aasaani se jeetne ja rahi he
 The BJP leader said, "if the opinion poll is legally banned in this country, then the next step would be to stop analyzing political commentators who are in favor of some and against some
" ’chunaav ayog ne partiyon ko likhaa- bataao, bain laganaa chahie yaa nahinudhar, sabhi manyata praapt dalon ke adhyakshon, mahasachivon ko likhe patr main ayog ne kaha he, ‘ayog chahta he ki chunaav ke dauraan opinian pole karaane or iske parinaamon ko prakashit yaa prasaarit karne par pratibandh lagane ke prastaav ke bare main ayog ko avgat karaayaa jaae
 Please let us know your thoughts by 21 October 2013
 ’ isse pehle chunaav ayog ne sarkaar ko prastaav diya tha ki opinian pole par pratibandh lagaaya jaae, jiske baad sarkaar ne ayog se kaha ki is mudde par vah vibhinn dalon ke saath phir se vichaar-vimarsh kare

 -pradhanmantri ne paanch november 2015 ko is pariyojna kii aadharshila rakhi thi
 However, there was a slight delay in starting the work of this high-way, on which PM Modi also expressed displeasure
 -120 kilometre pratighante kii raftaar se farrate bhar sakate hai balki bina dilli main daakhil hue punjab, haryana, uttar pradesh, uttarakhand, rajasthan or himachal pradesh kaa safar bhi tay kar sakate hai

 com / u4lfexmq11 In this difficult time, there can be no better news for Sanjay Dutt than this
 ji haa
 If this good news turns out to be true, then Sanjay Dutt can not only be released from the water ahead of time but it is very possible that the rest of the sentence will be forgiven
 darasal, centre sarkaar ne sanjay dutt kii baaki kii sajaa maaf karne ke liye maharashtra sarkaar se raay maangi he
 Sanjay Dutt has completed nearly two years in five years
 baaki teen saal kii sajaa ab bhi baaki he
 If his sentence is waived, he will not have to make envelopes to Sanjay Dutt in jail
 munna ko acting jail main nahin kerani padegi
 Munna will not have to wear the prisoner's uniform and hat, his haphazard beard will not grow
 mumbai main hue 1993 ke serial balast main avaidh rup se hathiyaar rakhane ke jurm main supreme court ne sanjay dutt ko 5 saal kii sajaa suna rakhi he
 Of these, Sanjay Dutt was sentenced to 18 months' sentence during his arrest in 1993 itself
 baaki bachi kareeb saadhe teen saal kii sajaa ko puri karne ke liye sanju baba 15 may ko pune kii yaravada jail pahunche or tab le 30 sibantar tak vahiin rahe
 On October 1, he was discharged from the jail for 14 days under furlough for special reasons
 baad main beemaari ke chalate ye chuttee or 14 dinon ke liye badha di gai
 Accordingly, Sanjay Dutt is currently out of jail till October 28
 29 oktober ko unhen waapas yaravada jail janaa hoga, taaki baaki ke 42 maheene kii sazaa puri kar saken
 Now just waiting for the reply of the letter, now the central government has sought opinion from the Maharashtra government on the issue of Sanjay Dutt's apology
 centre ne ek khat likhakar maharashtra sarkaar se poocha he ki kya 1993 main avaidh taur par hathiyaar rakhane ke gunahagaar sanjay dutt ko bhartiya samvidhan kii dhara 161 ke tahat maafee di ja sakati he
 Obviously, if the Maharashtra Government's answer to this matter comes out yes, then it is very possible that Sanjay Dutt can breathe in the open air before the rest of his sentence of three years
 sanjay dutt ko sajaa kaa elaan hote hi press council of india ke adhyaksh justise markandeya katju ne samvidhan kii dhara 161 kaa hawala dete hue naa sirf sanjay ko maafi dene kii vakaalat kii thi, balki iske liye pradhanmantri or raashtrapati se bhi guzarish kii thi
 Then there was a lot of debate across the country about this matter, but now, after passing the matter for a while, the Central Government has asked the Maharashtra Government for an opinion on the issue of Sanjay's release and that he too is Munna Bhai Is entitled to the release gift even before the execution of the sentence
 parivaar kii achchhaayiyon kaa milegaa fal!kehete hai insaan agar koi acha kaam karata he, to uskaa fal turant nahin to der saver jarur miltaa he
 Sanjay Dutt is probably going to see the goodness of the Dutt family
 sanjay kii sajaa maafee ke liye justise katju ne rajyapal se jo guzarish kii thi, usamen dutt parivaar kii achchhaayiyon kaa bhi zikr tha
 Katju wrote, 'neither Sanjay Dutt is a culprit for the Mumbai blasts nor does Sanjay Dutt have any old criminal track record
 or to or sanjay dutt ke parivaar ne or khud sanjay dutt ne samaaj ko kaafii kuch diya he
 In such a situation, Sanjay Dutt can be pardoned in this case of Arms Act as per Section 161 of the Constitution
 ' The discord within the country's opposition party BJP is constantly deepening

 Vaidya has written in his blog that Narendra Modi's intention seems to be behind the bjp's Rajya Sabha MP and senior advocate Ram Jethmalani who have made allegations against Gadkari and demanded action
 unhone kaha ki 2014 main party kii ore se koun pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar honge iske bare main kayaas lagaana, abhi jaldbaaji hogi
 Vaidya further wrote that we (BJP) will have to unite instead of quarreling among themselves
 saath hi vah yah likhte hai ki ho saktaa he ki narendra modi ko aisa lagata ho ki party adhyaksh ke rup main gadakari unke pradhanmantri banane ke rup main roda atka sakate hai is kaaran unhone gadakari ko hataane ke liye jethmalani kaa prayog kiya ho

 The chief of the government, which was trying to maintain a majority after the Trinamool Congress withdrew its support, has already held separate banquet meetings with SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav and BSP chief Mayawati, who are supporting their rule from outside
 shuukravaar ko unke nivas 7 res course road par upie ke ghatak dal ke netaaon kii bhoj baithak thi
 Singh has invited BJP Parliamentary Party President LK Advani, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj and Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley on Saturday night's banquet
 vaise pradhanmantri aam taur se har sansad satr se pehle mukhya vipakshi dal ke varisht sadasyon ko bhoj par bulaate hai
 This banquet diplomacy of the Prime Minister is seen in the context of whether he gets the support of the members of the House to pass it if he moves the important bill to allow foreign direct investment in the controversial retail sector
 bhaajapa sadasyon se lokapal vidheyak, bhrashtachar ke muddon or manhagaai aadi muddon par bhi charchaa kii sambhaavna he
 Even after the Trinamool Congress withdrew its support from the UPA, the government still has the support of more than 273 members needed for a majority in the 545-member Lok Sabha
 agar use baahar se samarthan de rahe sapa or basapa ke kul 43 sadsy bhi saath bane rahete hai to yah aankada 300 ko paar kar jayega
 But if there is a vote on FDI, the Prime Minister will have to ensure that this figure of support for UPA remains

 Without him, 243 members can be considered in favor of FDI in the House right now

 In such a situation, 18 members of DMK, BSP 21, SP 22, Akali Dal four, BJD 14 and 17 other members can reverse the game
 273 kaa jaadui aankada paar karne ke liye sarkaar ko inamen se sirf 30 ke samarthan kii jarurat he
 On the other hand, if the DMK, SP and BSP do not participate in voting on FDI, the government will need the support of 243 members instead of 273 to get it passed

 kuch aise hi gul khilaaye hai asaram ke kapoot narayan sai ne, jisane ek talakshuda ladki kii dhokhe se ek aise insaan se shaadi karvaa di, jisaki jameen par uski ayyashi kaa adda chalata tha
 Narayan Sai did not even give the girl a chance to speak and think anything
 chand dinon main hi ladki ko pataa chalaa ki uske saath us insaan ne dhokhaa kiya he jise vah bhagwaan maanati thi
 Not only that, when the girl came to complain to Narayan that she had married him, she was not divorced, Narayanasai indulged in indecent behavior knowing that she was pregnant
 saath hi us ladki ko garbh giraane ke liye jaan se maarane kii lagaataar dhamkee di
 The victim's fault was only that she was beautiful, who had a dirty eye on Narayan Sai, and her troubles started from that day
 ek talakshuda ladki jiskaa puraa parivaar baapu or narayan ko bhagwaan kii tarah maanata tha
 Living near the ashram of Asaram in Indore, on 10 December 2004, Narayan Sai summoned his close friend Ishwar Wadhwani to his hut (farmhouse, which belongs to God)
 saath hi mahila ko bhi bulawaaya
 Describing God as her devotee at two in the afternoon, the woman got her married
 is shaadi main sirf ishwar ke parijan hi the jabaki mahila ke ghar se koi bhi nahin tha
 Narayan told the woman that this is happening by order of God, not me
 phir mahila ke pita ko narayan ne phone kar kaha kii unhone unki beti kii shaadi karvaa di he
 She is going to her in-laws, bless her
 farrotedaar english bolanewaali padhi likhi mahila dhokhe se anjaan thi
 But after two months of marriage she became pregnant and due to the changing nature of her husband she came to know that she was a victim of deception
 use shaadi ke teen maah baad pataa chal gaya kii uski shaadi jis ishwar se karai gai he uski pehali patni se talaak nahin hua he
 She was receiving threats of miscarriage
 mahila ne tay kiya ki vah bhrun hatya nahin karegi or bachche ko janm degi
 So mountains of trouble started to break on him
 vah bhaag kar apane maayke aa gayi
 On January 29, when Narayan Sai came for a lecture in Mhow, Indore on the day of his birthday, the aggrieved woman thought to ask Narayan Sai why he had spoiled her life
 yahi sochakar mahila mau pahuchi to narayan ne use apane shayankaksh main bulaayaa or iske pehle vah bol paati, narayan sai ne uske saath ashleel harakat kar di
 After this incident, the woman lost her faith in her God
 tamaam takalifon ke baad usne ek bete ko 1 sitambar ko janm diya or uskaa naam hari rakhaa
 But see the misfortune of this child that its father refused to own it and it is from this that the story of the struggles of the man who is still fighting to name his son as father
 
 
 2004 main peedit mahila ne apane pati ke khilaaf dahej utpeedan or marpet kii exiaar darj karai
 But see the irony that the police filed an FIR but did not even mention the misdeeds of Narayan Sai
 maamla court pahunchaa jahaan mahila ne likhit main court ko narayan sai kii dhokhadhadi bataai
 But the lawyers drool over seeing the case against millionaires Ishwar Wadhwani and Narayan Sai
 lihaaja mahila ke saath kagaji khel shuru hua
 Now the woman got the courage to come to the news of Asaram's misdeeds and, ignoring all the threats, she arrived on Thursday with SP Anil Kushwaha's office complaint but returned empty handed from there too
 ab shuukravaar ko mahila narayan sai or unke ajij ishwar vadhvani ke khilaaf court main pariwaad pesh karne ja rahi he, is ummid ke saath kii use nyaay mili or uske bete ko baap kaa naam mili saath hi narayan sai ko uske paap kii sajaa mil sake

 pradhyumna hatyakand ke aaropee conductor ashok ke vakil ne daawa kiya he ki is hatya ke maamle main ashok ko fansaaya ja rahaa he
 Earlier too, questions have been raised about Ashok's role
 haalanki ye bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki ashok kaa vakil vahi kar rahaa he, jo bachaav paksh ke vakil ko karnaa chahie
 After the killing of Pradyuman, conductor Ashokan confessed his crime to the police
 yahaan tak usne ajtak ke camere par bhi hatya kii baat kabool kii thi
 But now a new twist has come in this case
 darasal, ashok ke vakil mohit verma ne daawa kiya he ki ashok begunaah he
 Bus conductor Ashok's lawyer Mohit Verma says that Ashok has been implicated in the case
 police or skool prabandhan ne ashok par dabaav banaaya orarope kabool karwaane ke liye ke police ne use buree tarah tarchar kiya
 This revelation has once again put a question mark over this entire matter
 isse pehle bhi is tarah kii baat saamne ai thi ki hatya ke is sansanikhej maamle main shaayad ashok ko mohara banaaya ja rahaa he
 But the investigation and the evidence found Ashok to be the accused in the case
 yahaan tak ki skool toilet ke baahar lage sisitivi camere main bhi ashok ko hi aate or jate dekha gaya tha
 However, this can also be seen in the way that Mohit Verma is the lawyer for the accused Ashok and the job of the defense lawyer is to save his client till the end
 lekin vakil ke is bayaan se ek baar phir is maamle kii jaanch sawaalon ke ghere main hai
 Earlier it was also revealed that just before the murder of Pradyumna, the accused conductor Ashok was masturbating in the school toilet
 tabhi pradhyumna vahaan pahunch gaya or usne ashok ko aapattijanak haalat main dekh liya tha
 Then Ashok dragged him to the restroom, then he was trying to do wrong things with the child
 magar baccha shor machaane laga
 Began to protest tabhi ghabaraakar ashok ne chaaku nikaala or bachche kii gardan par ek ke baad ek, do waar kiye
 Due to which a stream of blood came out from Pradyuman's neck
 is dauraan khun kii kuch dhabbe ashok ke upar bhi aa gaye
 He was escorted out of the toilet
 takreeban aadhe ghante tak aaropee ashok khun se sane kapadon main ghumta rahaa
 Subhash, the second witness in the case, had prohibited Ashok from washing clothes
 usne ashok se kaha tha ki sabooton se chhedchhad na ho
 But still Ashok had washed his clothes
 doosraa gavaah subhash usee bas kaa driver he, jis par ashok conductor tha
 He also said that he saw conductor Ashok in blood-stained clothes
 ye he puraa maamlabeete shuukravaar gurugram ke reyaan international skool main duusari class main padhane vaale 7 saal ke maasoom pradhyumna kii galaa retkar berahami se hatya kar di gai thi
 The murder was blamed on Ashok, the conductor of the school bus
 police poochtacha main ashok ne apana jurm kabool kar liya
 Ashok told the police that he tried to have sex with Pradyuman
 naakaam hone par pakade jane ke dar se usne pradhyumna kii galaa retkar hatya kar di
 The Madhya Pradesh High Court has allowed the abortion of an 11-year-old, rape victim pregnant girl
 is bacchee ke saath kathith taur par uske chachaa ne dushkarm kiya tha
 Public Prosecutor Abhay Pandey said on Tuesday that a single bench of Justice Nandita Dubey, hearing the case on Monday, granted permission for the 27-week-old pregnant woman to undergo an abortion
 unhone kaha ki iske saath hi ucch nyaayalay ne apane vistrut faisle main kaha he ki visheshgy chikitsakon dwaara puri saavdhaanee baratkar jald se jald bacchee kaa garbhpaat karaayaa janaa chahie
 Pandey said the court disposed of the case with these instructions
 ullekhneey he ki dushkarm peedit kii maa ne apni beti ke garbhpaat kii anumati tikamgarh kii jila adaalat se na milane par ucch nyaayalay main guhaar lagaai or apni 11 saal kii bacchee kaa garbhpaat karaane kii anumati maangi
 On the court's order, the victim was subjected to two medical tests
 pehali report ke baad adaalat ne visheshgyon kii team se dobaaraa jaanch karaane ke aadesh diye
 The High Court in its judgment cited the report of the Medical Board examining the girl child
 board kaa kahana tha ki 11 saal kii garbhvatee bacchee kaa garbhpaat nahin karaayaa ja saktaa
 However, the report did not mention what the consequences of abortion would be
 iske baad peedita kii maa ne halafanama dete hue kaha ki puri jimmedaari unki hogi
 He said that he is ready to get an abortion only after seeing the future of his daughter
 iske baad ucch nyaayalay ne diene sample or bhrun sambhalakar rakhane ke nirdesh diye hai, kyonki bacchee or uski maa ne dushkarm kii shikaayat darj karaayi he

 ''amit shah par bhi hamalaarajya ke purv siem ashok gahalot ne amit shah par bhi hamalaa bolaa
 He said that Shah is afraid to go to the polls in the name of Vasundhara Raje, hence asking for votes in the name of Modi
 shah jab tak apane bete jai shah ke maamle main safai nahin dete tab tak rajasthan main aane kaa haq nahin he
 He further said that Shah is trying to raise the issue of Bangladesh and Akhlaq in hindu-muslims in Rajasthan

 yah sabhi department bhrashtachar kaa adda bane hue hai, mukhyamantri helicopter se udne main vyast hai, pradesh main kya ho rahaa he unhen isaki jaankaree nahin he
 The BJP government insulted the people, Gahlot said that the people had given a historic majority to the BJP government

 The beneficial schemes of the Congress were discontinued soon after coming to power
 unhone aage kaha ki rajya ke siem ke paas bataane ke liye paanch kaam bhi nahin hai
 During the Gaurav Yatra, the Chief Minister has repeatedly questioned that what the Congress has not done in 50 years, it has been done in 5 years

 berogari kii dar main hui badhotareeshok gahalot ne kaha ki rojgaar ke mudde par vasundhara raaje ne 15 lakh yuvaaon ko sarkari naukari dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 The unemployment rate at the national level is 6% but in Rajasthan this rate has increased to 10%
 mukhyamantri yuvaaon ko 16 lakh naukariyaan dene kaa daawa kar rahi he
 While the CAG report states that out of 1 lakh 27 thousand 817 trained youths, only 42 thousand 758 youths have been given employment
 jinke satyaapan par keval 9904 hi vaastavik paae gaye hai
 Questioning the beneficiaries program, Ashok Gehlot also said that for the first time in the state, the BJP government has created two separate classes in the name of beneficiary and disadvantaged
 gahalot ne bhamashah digital parivaar yojana par bhi sawaal khadey karte hue kaha ki sarkari khajaane se mobile ke liye ek hajaar rupee kii raashi uplabdh karwaane kii vyavastha kii gai he
 But the benefit of Rs 1000 crore spent on this scheme will be given only to a particular company
 rajasthan kaa karj bhaar badhishok gahalot ne gaurav yatra par sawaal khadey karte hue kaha ki mukhyamantri is dauraan loklubhaavan ghoshnaaon par raajnneetik hit saadhane main lagi hai
 But there is neither a budget provision for this nor the Chief Minister is in control of these schemes
 gahalot ne aage kaha ki kaig kii report ke mutabik congress ke samay rajasthan par 2012 -13 main 1 lakh 17 hajaar 809 karod rupee kaa karj bhaar tha jabaki bhaajapa sarkaar ne aaj uske dugune kaa bhaar rajya kii janata par daal diya he

 Sixth and seventh phase voting remains

 Where there is a fierce competition between the BJP and the Grand Alliance
 bijepi kii ore se jahaan lagaataar yah sawaal kiya ja rahaa he ki vipaksh kii ore se pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar koun he
 At the same time, the SP-BSP alliance has tried many times to tell that the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition can be from this alliance
 basapa pramukh mayawati ne haal hi main ek jansabha main sanket die the ki agar sab kuch acha rahaa to vah loksabhaa chunaav ladengi or pradhanmantri bhi ban sakati hai
 Two days after Mayawati's statement, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has stamped this and said that i also want to see him becoming Prime Minister
 angreji akhbaar mumbai mirar se baat karte hue akhilesh ne kaha, ‘gathbandhan hone ke baad mujhe unke bare main jaanane kaa kaaphi mauka mila he, maine unamem kaaphi achchhaiyaan bhi dekhi hai
 He is very disciplined and experienced with me
 ’sapa pramukh ne kaha, ‘unke or hamaare bich main ek jenereshan gap he, unhen pradhanmantri banataa dekh mujhe khushi hogi, iske liye main puri mehnat karne ke liye bhi taiyaar hum
 At the same time, he too is ready to see me as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 ’gauratlab he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi or puri bhartiya janata party vipaksh par isi baat kaa tanj kasate hai ki modi nahin to koun? or vipaksh isi baat par har baar pichhadta nazar aa rahaa tha, lekin ab paanch charan puure hone ke baad mayawati ne khule taur par apni daavedaari pesh kar di he
 And Akhilesh Yadav has also supported him
 bataa den ki uttar pradesh desh kaa sabase bada rajya he, jahaan 80 loksabhaa siten hai
 The SP-BSP are fighting these seats together and RLD is also with them

 He targeted the BJP and said that he sets fire

 ' madhyapradesh main afasaron ke lagaataar ho rahe tabadalon par nayaa vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 Alam is that after 15 years, about 500 officers have been transferred during the 5-month tenure of the Congress government which came to power in Madhya Pradesh
 isamen iees, ipies or iesces samet anya grad ke adhikariyon ke tabadale ho chuke hai
 Aaj Tak spoke to Law Minister PC Sharma on the frequent transfers, he termed it a normal process
 mantri sharma ne kaha ki 'ye ek saamaanya prakriya he or koi bhi nai sarkaar vyavastha main kasaavat laane ke liye afasaron ke transfar karti he
 In the era of the Bharatiya Janata Party, posting was done with money, there is no such thing in Kamal Nath and Congress government
 jisaki jahaan upyogita he unki vah posting kii ja rahi he
 Sharma said that it is a matter of going to the Haj after eating a hundred rats, of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 'sarkaar bhale hi ise saamaanya prakriya bataa rahi he lekin ek sach ye bhi he ki afasaron ke tabadalon par hone vaale kharche ko shaayad sarkaar kaa dhyaan nahin he
 In fact, when any All India Service officer is transferred, the cost incurred during that transfer is borne by the government
 isamen samaan kii shifting se lekar afasar or uske parijanon kii ek jagah se duusari jagah yatra kaa vyay bhi shaamil hota he
 Let us tell you that the officers or family members of All India Services are paid up to the first class
 ab agar aankadon par najar daalen to pataa chalegaa ki madhyapradesh main lagbhag 500 afasaron ke tabadalon se hi sarkari khajaane par kareeb kareeb 32 karod rupye kaa bhaar pad chukaa he
 In this, even if you leave the paid vacation during the transfer, the figure will be around 12 crores
 akele transfar grant ke rup main in afasaron ko inaki selary kaa 80 fisadi rupaya miltaa he or afasaron kii sankhya ke lihaaj se joden to ye rakam kareeb 8 karod rupye ke lagbhag baithti he
 This amount is more because there are many officers who have been transferred more than once in the past months
 aise main unhen transfar ke dauraan milane vaali rakam bhi bad jaati he
 At the same time during transportation, they are given Rs 50 per km as transportation expenses for transporting the goods from one place to another
 'tabadalaa udyog chalaa rahi sarkaar'vahiin duusari ore bijepi ne baar-baar ho rahe tabadalon ke bich sarkaar par 'tabadalaa udyog' chalaane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Shivraj was a minister in the government and Vishwas Sarang, MLA from Narela Assembly, said that he had said that he will give employment
 rojgaar to nahin diya or diya to congress ke dallalon ko or congress ke vidhayakon ko tabadale main paise lo posting idhar se udhar karwaao, tabadalaa udyog fale or foole or vah tabadalaa udyog jab fal phool jaae, paisa aa jaae to mukhyamantri nivas hawala udyog main badal jaae
 'leader of Opposition in the Assembly Gopal Bhargava has said that the Kamal Nath government once again started the transfer industry after the removal of the code of conduct
 pradesh sarkaar ne thok main iees, ipies or anya vibhaagon se jude saikadon adhikariyon ke tabadale kar die hai

 Therefore, BJP and Congress have wielded full power

 On the last day of campaigning for the assembly by-election, all the Diggaj entered the election ground

 Due to this also the leaders of BJP and Congress are putting full force to win here

 At the same time, former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot also did a road show in Alwar
 bataa den, 29 janvari ko in teenon seat par matdaan hone hai
 Vasundhara said - During Bharosa on Bhagwan and Janata Janardhana, Vasundhara Raje claimed to win elections on all three seats and said that God is my everything
 mere saamne khadi janata mere liye ishwar he or inase hi mujhe jeet kii ummid he
 Raj Babbar and Nagma attended the road show of Sachin Pilot from the Congress
 pushkar se shuru hokar ajmer ke alag-alag ilaakon main road sho hua
 Sachin Pilot claimed to win all three seats
 Sachin Pilot said that we are winning all three seats
 darasal congress ne ise bijepi ke 4 saal ke kaarykaal par refrendom qaraar diya he to bijepi vidhansabha chunaav se pehle in teenon siton par chunaav jitkar dikhaanaa chaahati he ki rajya main anti inakambency kaa koi factor nahin he
 On the other hand, Ashok Gehlot has emerged strong after the Gujarat assembly elections
 aise main rajasthan main apane vajood ko bachaane ke liye sachin payalat ko dikhaanaa hoga ki janata unhen pasand karti he
 It is necessary for BJP to win these three seats before the assembly elections
 ise vasundhara sarkaar ke 4 saal ke kaarykaal ke refrendom ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, Sachin Pilot also has to prove his existence
 congress ke prachaar main purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot bhi puri takat laga rahe hai
 It would be interesting to see who the 29 voters choose and who they reject
 philhal congress or bijepi donon ke liye yah teenon hi seat pratishtha kaa sawaal bani hui hai

 Sources said that Jogi said that without any delay it should be announced that the Congress will contest the next Lok Sabha elections under Rahul's leadership and any delay in this will not be beneficial for the party
 sutara ne bataaya ki jab jogi ne yah suzav diya tab pradhanmantri manmohan singh, congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi maujuud the
 However, none of these three said anything on Jogi's suggestion

 And such things are being heard in the party that he will soon play an important role in the organization

 Fossils and living animals have appeared in many photographs taken by Mars Rovers
 "martian keet-jaise jeevon ke bich spasht vividhta hoti he, jo keede ke samaan kai visheshtaayen pradarshit karte hai
 Romoser continued, these are seen as higher groups
 udhaaharan ke liye, pankhons kii upasthiti, wing flection, furtili gliding or vibhinn sanrachit pair tatv aadi
 Romoser said that when he was looking for indicators of biological activity, Martian rovers saw several photographs that clearly show forms such as insect and reptile
 kai tasviren aisi chhaviyaan dikhaati hai, jahaan aarthropod body segment, pair, antina or pankhons ko aasapaas ke kshetra se alag dekha ja saktaa he
 Each photograph has been studied at different levels of photography, including brightness, contrast, saturation, inversion, and many more

 The criteria used in Romoser's research include clarity of form from surroundings, body symmetry, division of body parts, repetitive forms, skeletal remains and proximity to each other, observation of forms, etc

 Once the explicit image of a given form was identified and described, Romoser said, which was used to facilitate the recognition of less obvious things but no picture is any less valid "

 On these grounds, arthropods, insect-like creatures can be seen in the pictures of Mars rover
 " ye jeev prithvi par madhumakhiyon se milte julate hai
 In other photographs these "bees" have appeared as shelters or nests in the caves

 Since the release of Baby Baby on Republic Day in 2015, Akshay Kumar's image has become that of an actor who films on issues related to patriotism or public interest

 BCCI chief n Srinivasan expressed his confidence in the Indian cricket team facing criticism saying that the team can still defeat any of the top teams in the world and in Australia it needs only a little luck to change things

 ’ unhone yah bhi kaha ki team itani kadi aalochanaon kii hakdaar nahin he jo chaaron taraf se ho rahi hai
 The comments shrinivasana ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki unki aisi aalochana nahin kii ja sakati 
 With a little luck the result could have been different
 ham har match nahin jeet sake, sabhi shrinkhlaayen nahin jeet sakate
 He, however, said that he was not defending the team, which has so far lost all three Tests in Australia
 shrinivasana ne kaha, ‘main bhartiya team ke pradarshan kaa bachaav nahin kar rahaa

 The BJP has handed over the command of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 goa main bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini ke duusare or aakhri din party adhyaksh rajnath singh ne modi ko party kii chunaav prachaar samiti kaa adhyaksh banane kaa elaan kiya
 As soon as Narendra Modi was announced to be the President of BJP Election Campaign Committee, a wave of celebrations raged among BJP workers across the country
 dilli, chandigarh, bhopal, varanasi, lakhanu, jammu tamaam jagahon par bijepi kaaryakartaaon ne jashn manaaya
 While the bjp's ally Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal have congratulated Narendra Modi for leading the campaign, JDU is unhappy with his promotion
 shiromani akali dal ke adhyaksh sukhbir singh badal ne ise gemeanger bataate hue kaha ki ye elaan upie ke bhrasht shashan ke khatme kii shuruyaat karegaa
 At the same time, Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray, who has been traveling abroad these days, has congratulated Modi on the phone
 jabaki narendra modi kii aguwai main 2014 kaa chunaav ladane ke bijepi ke faisle se jediu naakhush he
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, JDU MP Ali Anwar said that now the relationship between BJP and JDU will not be normal
 jediu ko gathbandhan par dobaaraa vichaar karnaa hoga
 He said that JDU leaders can neither share the stage nor campaign with Narendra Modi
 lalu ne poocha, 'ab kya karegi jediu'narendra modi ko loksabhaa chunaav prachaar samiti kaa adhyaksh banane ke baad argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ne jediu se chutki lee he
 Lalu said that now JDU should tell what she will do
 lalu ne kaha ki modi or adwani main koi antar nahin he
 At the same time, the Congress did not give any consideration to the handing over of the election campaign of BJP to Narendra Modi
 congress pravaktaa shakeel ahamed ne kaha ki karnataka chunaav main log modi kii kaabiliyat dekh chuke hai
 After some speeches Modi's bud will open
 wo til kaa tad banane main maahir hai
 On the other hand, after the party was made the chairman of the election campaign committee, the Chief Minister of Gujarat and bjp's firebrand leader Narendra Modi thanked all the other leaders and workers of the party including the president Rajnath Singh
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe party ne bahut bada sammaan diya he, nai jimmedaari puri karne main koi kami nahin chhoduunga
 "amidst the warm atmosphere on the second and last day of the BJP National Executive Council meeting in Goa, the newly appointed BJP Election Committee chairman said," i have learned to walk by holding the finger of senior BJP leaders
 meri kshamta par kaaryakartaaon kaa adhikaar he
 i have considered politics as a medium of service and power is not a means of enjoyment for me
 mere jivan main goa ne vishesh sthaan paa liya he
 Naiyya is crossing whenever blessed in Goa
 'centre sarkaar par saadhaa nishanachunaav prachaar samiti kaa chairman banane ke baad modi ne apane pehle sambodhan main centre kii upie sarkaar par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 He also quipped on the 'bharat Nirman' advertisement of the UPA government
 unhone kaha, 'upie kaa vigyaapan kahata he ki bharat nirmaan par haq he meraa
 But the truth is that there is no doubt about the creation of India, i doubt it
 ' unhone kaha, centre kii sarkaar par bhrashtachar ke aaropon kaa asar nahin padataa he
 No BJP chief minister has been accused of corruption
 aise main centre sarkaar se logon kaa bharosa uth gaya he
 Now Congress is leaving CBI behind everyone
 vipaksh kaa koi netaa baaki nahin he, jiske peeche sibiai naa chodi ho
 Taking a dig at the Congress over the issue of Naxalism, Modi said, "the policies of the government have forced the youth to pick up guns
" congress ko desh ke naujavaanon kii chintaa nahin he
 Red corridor is being formed from Pashupati to Tirupati
 ' unhone kaha, 'bharat ko asahaay nahin choda ja saktaa
 Work is on to destroy the institutions
 sarkaar ne rashtriya salaahkaar parishad (enesi) banaakar yojana ayog ko kamjor kiya he
 Congress does not have the mindset to accept change
 'modi ne garajte hue kaha, 'pradhanmantri vaise to swasth the, hilte dulte nahin the, lekin meri baat sunakar chetana aa gai
 i said that the Prime Minister himself is associated with the Maoists, the chairman of a committee in your planning commission
 'modi ne kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'ham akhbaar main dikhen yaa naa dikhen, tivi par chamakein naa chamakein, koshish karen logon ke dilon tak pahunchen
 a clear indirect mark on Advani, Narendra Modi appeared indirectly targeting Advani, including other leaders, when he praised party president Rajnath Singh saying that his generosity would not be understood by the people sitting outside
 bijepiki chunaav prachaar samiti kaa adhyaksh banaaye jane ke baad modi ne kaha, ‘main party adhyaksh rajnath singh ke prati bahut kritagya hum ki unhone na keval mujhe nai jimmedaari saunpi he balki kaaryakartaaon or desh kii janata ke saamne bahut sammaan bhi diya he
 'modi said,' Rajnathji stood up to speak and asked me to sit down
 baahar jo log baithe hai unke liye iske mahatv ko samajhnaa kathin he
 a person does not do this only on the position, but it is also necessary for him to have a big heart
 ise dariyaadilii kehete hai, jo party adhyaksh ne dikhaai
 Modi did not say anything more but it is believed that by making such remarks, he pointed to Advani and some other leaders who did not attend the meeting of the National Executive

 paryaton sthalon ko sanvaarane ke liye vishwa bank ne 2,100 karod rupee kaa sahyog pradaan karne par sahmati jataai he
 State tourism minister Om Prakash Singh said these things in an interview
 singh ne vishesh baatcheet main kaha ki rajya ke paryaton sthalon ke vikaas ko lekar sarkaar phikrmand he
 The work of making the tourist destinations world class will be started in the next few times
 om prakaash singh ne kaha, 'rajya main paryaton ko badhaava dene ke liye sarkaar kai kadam uthaa rahi he
 An agreement has been reached with the World Bank, under which it will spend Rs 2,100 crore to develop these tourist centers
 paryaton ke lihaaj se uttar pradesh ko chaar kshetron main baanta gaya he or sarkaar kii yah koshish he ki har paryaton sthal kaa samuchit vikaas ho sake
 Singh said that in view of the historical and mythological importance of Agra, Mathura, Sarnath, Ayodhya and Vrindavan these centers will be given special attention
 singh se yah puche jane par ki gujarat or madhya pradesh kii tarah paryatakon ko aakarshith karne ke liye uttar pradesh sarkaar paryaton sthalon kii branding kyon nahin kar rahi he? is sawaal ke jawaab main paryaton mantri ne badi hi safagoi se kaha ki soochna vibhaag ke paas itnaa paisa nahin he ki vigyapanon ke madhyam se or kisi vyakti ko brands ambesader banaakar paryaton sthalon kii branding karai jaae
 First of all it has to be understood that the development of tourist destinations is the most important task and the government is moving forward in this direction
 paryaton mantri ne yah bhi bataaya ki vishwa bank kii madad se rajya ke paryaton kshetra ko ek nai disha milegi
 Since this is also the Chief Minister's Deem Project, efforts will be made to complete this work at the earliest
 singh ne kaha ki soobe main kai aise sthal hai, jinka ek baar vikaas hone ke baad bahut phayda hoga
 For example, the government is developing Tajganj located in Agra, renovation and cleaning of the Ghats of Varanasi will be started soon
 grih janapad gajipur ke paryaton kshetron ke vikaas ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha, paryaton kii drushti se gajipur ke jitne bhi sthal hai, unke vikaas ke liye sarkaar ne kareeb 10 karod kii raashi aavantit kii he, jinamein kamkhya dham mandir kaa vikaas pramukh rup se shaamil he
 On the question of falling law and order in the state, Singh said, you people feel that law and order is bad, but it is not so
 media dwaara kanoon vyavastha kharaab hone kaa prachaar kiya ja rahaa he
 This is not the actual situation
 singh ne kaha ki jahaan kahin bhi sthiti bigadi he use sambhaalane ke liye mukhyamantri swayan aage aae hai
 Whether there are riots in the state or the case of former minister Raja Bhaiya, action has been taken immediately and with transparency in all matters
 sarkaar kii chhavi kharaab karne kii koshish lagaataar kii ja rahi he
 Asked about contesting from Ghazipur parliamentary seat, Singh said, "this is a completely absurd question and no one is willing to contest the Lok Sabha elections for them
" unke mutabik vah pehle hi itnaa chunaav lard chuke hai ki ab isaki jarurat mahasoos nahin hoti
 They are trying to fulfill the important responsibility which has been given at the state level
 pichley kuch saal se smartphone industry kii vajah bharat main jitna artificial intelligence turm kaa yuj hua he, shaayad hi aisa pehle kabhi hua hoga
 Almost every mid-range smartphone in the market is now claimed to feature Artificial Intelligence
 baharhaal ab bajet 2019 kii baat karte hai jisamen artficial intelligence kaa zikr hua he
 Union Minister Piyush Goyal, reading the Interim Budget in Parliament, said that the government will open the National Center for Artificial Intelligence and soon the Artificial Intelligence Portal will be launched
 unhone kaha he ki neshnal AI portal jald hi develop kiya jayega
 The new Artificial Intelligence Portal will be created under the support of the National Program on Artificial Intelligence
 piyush goyal ne kaha he ki artfishil intelligence program kaa istemaal logon ko AI or isse judi takanic kaa phayda dilaane ke liye hoga
 Its national centers will be built which will serve as hubs
 iske 9 aria chun liye gaye hai
 What will happen in the AI portal prepared by the government and how will the people be benefited from it? At present, the government has not mentioned this in the budget
 lekin aapke liye ye jaananaa jaruri he ki artificial intelligence kya he or aapke de tu de life main kaise phydemand sabit ho saktaa he
 Yes, it also has its disadvantages and the big technology giants of the world believe that it can put the world in danger

 unhone centre sarkaar ko chetavanee di ki vah dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene kii dillivaasiyon kii aakankshaon se nahin 'khele'
 Jain expressed grief that he would not be able to end bribery in Delhi Police even if he wanted to
 unhone dilli police pramukh bies bassi par party pravaktaa kii tarah vyavhaar karne ke aarope bhi lagaae
 According to the minister, Delhi government can operate law and order more effectively, which is not possible under the current system, where the responsibility is with the Union Home Ministry
 unhone kaha, aap (centre) police ko hamen kyon nahin saunp dete? vyavastha ne mujhe asahaay kar diya he
 The Delhi Home Minister does not even have the strength to stop bribery in the police if he wants to
 dilli ke logon ne hamen janadesh diya he, ab centre ko hamen purna rajya kaa darja dena chahie or logon kii aakankshaon se khilwaad karnaa band karnaa chahie
 The comments 'aap' sarkaar main mahatvapurn aawaaj ke rup main ubhare jain ne indian voomens press kor main media ke saath baatcheet ke dauraan yah tippanee kii
 Jain asked, through which agency will you ensure the safety of women, when the Commissioner of Delhi Police talks like a party spokesperson? Where is the Police Commissioner invites the Chief Minister to a public debate? The minister claimed that there are all political parties against a strong and independent Lokpal, as this would harm 'their vested interests'
 jain ne maang kii, kripaya bhrashtachar nirodhak shakha hamen saunp dijie
 The Union Home Minister has to look into many things including paramilitary force, intelligence department
 unke paas samay kahaan hai ki vah dilli police ko dekhen? endiemasi kaa kshetra apane paas rakhen or shesh hamen saunp den

 He said, why don't you (the center) hand over the police to us? The system has made me helpless
 dilli ke grih mantri ke paas itani takat bhi nahin he ki vah agar chaahe bhi to police main rishwatakhori ko roak nahin saktaa
 The people of Delhi have given us a mandate, now the Center should give us full statehood and stop messing with the aspirations of the people
 tippaniyan Jain, who emerged as an important voice in the AAP government, made the remarks during an interaction with the media at the Indian Women's Press Corps
 jain ne poocha, kis agency ke madhyam se aap mahilaon kii suraksha sunishchit karenge, jab dilli police ke kamishnar party pravaktaa kii tarah baat karte hai? kahaan kaa police kamishnar mukhyamantri ko saarvajanik bahes kaa nimantran detaa he? mantri ne daawa kiya ki majboot or swatantra lokapal ke khilaaf saare raajnneetik dal hai, kyonki isse 'unke nihit swaarthon' kaa nuksaan hoga

 When Narendra Modi came to contest elections from here in May last year, there was no place to set foot on our roads
 maine to jamaane ke bahut rang dekhe hai, lekin mere aaj ke logon ke saamne vakt kaa pahiyaa narendra modi kii mukhar aawaaj par gum rahaa tha
 My people were seeing the image of such a hero in Narendra Modi, who would solve every problem of him in a pinch
 unhen bharpoor samarthan mila or jab wo desh ke pradhanmantri bane to ghutanon ke bal chalati hamaari ye ummiden marathon ke dhaavak kii tarah daudane lageen
 But a year passed in waiting
 mere daaman par padaa gandagi kaa kooda nahin hataa
 There is a possibility of not moving
 in dinon gangotri youth brigade ke sadsy hamaare kshetra ke nae safaikarmi hai
 More than 30 working boys pick up the garbage in the morning, clean the drain, clean their street with a broom before going to work or studying
 mohalle main bajabajate kooday, afasaron kii nafarmani, nagar nigam main kii gai shikayaton ko nagar nigam ne jab kooday main daal diya to is andekhi ne inke haath main jhaadu, fawda or safai kii trollies pakadaa di
 Gangotri Youth Brigade president Gopal Singh says, "there was so much filth here that it became difficult to live and we were defeated by complaining in government offices
" ham logon ko safai kii koi sarkari vyavastha nahin mil paa rahi thi tab ham logon ne swayan jimmaa uthaaya ki ham log saafe karenge
 ' ye haal sirf hamaare isi mohalle kaa nahin balki har gali main, har sadak par aapako kooday kaa ambaar laga mil jayega
 This mess of garbage management has made this city among the first list of dirty cities of the country
 gauratlab he ki 19 lakh kii aabaadi vaale shahar main har rose kooday kii nikasi 600 metric ton hoti he
 There is a claim to lift 500 metric tonnes of garbage but the way to Ramna dumping area is bad and there is no littering due to opposition from the villagers
 karsada damping kshetra main plant kaa sanchaalan thapp he
 Garbage houses are 23 closed, only two are open
 haalanki nagar nigam ke paas 2700 safaikarmi, 7 jesibi, 18 damfar, 9 damfar cresar, 17 tanker, 11 hoper or 32 chota hoper he
 Despite this, the municipal corporation officials and the Mayor claim that there will be an early disposal of garbage
 pradhanmantri ke liye hamaare shahar yani apane hi sansadeey kshetra main kooda prabandhan ek badi chunauti bani hui he
 The condition of Karsara and Ramna plant is in a bad state
 kooda nistaaran ke liye nagar nigam ke paas upyukt thikaana nahin he
 The city is of narrow streets
 yahaan kooda ghar ke liye khaali jagah nahin milti
 There is also difficulty in keeping the container
 kooda ghar dhwast hai aise main har rose 600 metric ton nikalne vaala kooda sadakon or galiyon ke bich logon ke naak main dam kiye hue he or ye haal tab he jab pichley kai dashakon se hamaare saansad, vidhayak or meyar bijepi ke hi rahe hai
 Who are still showing the dreams of clean and beautiful Kashi, not only of these garbage
 bijepi ke netaaon ko modi main rab dikhataa he to dikhe
 Kashi belongs to Shiva and i know the whole reality
 kabhi mere angan main aakar modi ne kaha tha ki unhen to ganga ne bulaayaa he
 He came even when he became Prime Minister
 mere assi ghat par
 Also picked up the broom
 fawda bhi chalaaya
 He promised to save the Ganges from which people get salvation, when they are being killed by the weapons of pollution
 lekin vaade hai, vaadon kaa kya
 Whenever my fingers touch the Ganges, i feel the pain and pollution brought to my soul
 modi aae the
 Will also come tomorrow
 lekin hamaara dard to jas kaa tas he
 My villages are still backward today
 unamem se hi ek pichde gaanv jayapur ko pradhanmantri modi ne god liya tha
 i was also happy that one of my villages would be rejuvenated
 ye kushi haqiqat main bhi badalati dikh rahi he vahaan sadake bijli pani ke saath duusari buniyadi suvidhaayen shaharon jaisi ho gai he
 But we tell you the reality of our city, how the city has lost its life due to dusty roads and dust
 agar aap saans ke rogi, dama or asthma se peedit he or in dinon apane pradhanmantri ke sansadeey kshetra main aana chaahate hai to sanbhal ke aaen kyonki yahaan kii hawa main ud rahe dhul ke kan or gadiyon ke carbon aap kii beemaari ko badha sakate hai
 And those who do not suffer from these diseases should also be cautious as the Banaras Fiza has been polluted to dangerous levels
 ye bate ham hi nahin pradooshan vibhaag bhi kah rahaa he
 TN Singh of the Pollution Department says that there is a vascular pollution, vehicles coming into the city, excavation has been going on in the city of Benaras for decades, its parts are flying, there is a problem with genset, it also has a great effect It is falling and Menali who is having Vascular Pollution is counting 80 to 85 percent
 banaras kii hawa main ghulte is zehar ke hairaan karne vaale aankade tab saamne aae jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek hafte pehle rashtriya vaayu gunvattta suchakank lagu kiya
 Its indices suggest that the fijas of Banaras are not breathable
 banaras ke ardli bazaar sthit suchakank kaa sensor bataata he ki piem 10 kii maatra kaa ausat 244 micron prati ghan centimetre he
 It recorded a minimum of 110 and a maximum of 427
 jabaki iskaa str 60 micron prati ghan centimetre se kam hona chaiye
 Similarly, dust particles smaller than 10 microns were found to be 7 times more than the standard
 isi kram main piem 2
 The average volume of 5 was 220
 choubees ghante main iskaa nunatam 50 or adhiktam 500 record kiya gaya jabaki isaki maatra 40 se kam honi chaiye
 That is, it is 12 times more than the standard
 hawa main ghule partical kitne khatarnaak hai, is par biechayu ke profesar bi di treepathi kehete hai, 'particulet matter kaa saise jisko kii 100 micron prati ghan centimetre hona chaiye wo 300 se 400 mil rahaa he
 This is a very dangerous sign
 ye indicate karata he ki banaras kii hawa saans lene laayak nahin he
 No one knows this, except when i am there, as there is no existence of Shiva
 main shiv ke trishul basii hum yaa sheshnag ke fan par, isapar log baaten karte hai lekin ek vakt tha ki aryavart kaa koi bhi shahar mujhase zyada anushaasit, sabhy or tarakkee vaala nahin tha
 But today there is a lot of population pressure in my narrow streets
 gadiyon kaa aana janaa bhi bahut he
 According to a rough estimate, there are about 11 lakh scooters and motor cycles
 1 lakh se upar car or jeep hai, tractor 5300 hazaar he to trailor 10 hazaar
 Similarly, there are trucks and buses whose diseases are increasing due to smoke
 aajkal ke dhanvantari bataate hai ki in dinon saans or or dame ke marij mere shahar main bahut bad gaye hai
 In the midst of all this, the problem of sewer is leprous
 jagah-jagah pipe line toote he
 Their water is on the roads
 gharon main jo pani kii supplai he usamen bhi siver kaa pani mil jaataa he jise log pine ke liye majboor hai
 This misery is not just about the ravaged, dusty road and sewer
 balki hamaare apane angan ke thatheri bazaar kii gali main kabhi guzarate vaqt chheni hathaudi si nikalne vaali awaz, gop kii binawat, mogul parataji, bengali nakhaas, gadhaai kaa kaam, bartan kaa kaam, tabak ke kaam jaise do darjan se zyada kalaon kii daastaan sunaaya karti thi
 But today there is silence here
 yahi haal bunakaron kaa he
 The business of Banarasi sarees is about 1 thousand crores with exports of 300 to 400 crores every year
 kabhi ye aankada isse kai guna zyaada tha
 Because then the raw material associated with it was made only in Benaras and many parts of the country
 lekin aaj haalat ye he ki china se yarn aane laga he
 The big irony on this is that the government is levying 25 per cent tax on raw material Chinese yarn, while the finished goods made from this yarn which are coming from China are only taxing 10 per cent which is destroying the industry here
 is
 yahi haul polister, nylon, coton, marsraiced, viscorse, jaise desh main banane vaale dhaagon kaa he
 The weaver from whose debt is never able to recover
 modi ji se unhen ummid jaagi thi lekin haath maayusi hi lagi
 According to a 2007 survey in Banaras, there were about 5255 small large units
 isame sari broked, zaradozi, zari metal, gulabiminakaari, kundankaree, jewelri, pathar kii kataai, glass painting, beeds, dari, karpet, wal hanging, mukut work jaise chote manzole udyog the
 About 20 lakh people used to work in these and this business was 7500 crores
 lekin iname 2257 ikai puri tarah band ho chuki hai or baaki bachi bhi band hone ke kagaar par hai
 But after the coming of the Modi government and emphasizing his Make in India and Skill Development, his talk had brought great expectations to the people associated with these industries
 par bajet main inke liye koi thos upaay na hone kii vajah se ye log behad niraash hai
 The same is true of the wooden toy industry
 apni taraf barabas khinchate ye khilone agar bol sakate to apane gadhane vaale kii bebasii zarur bayaan karte
 The lifeless sticks roaming fast in the Kashmiri street of Banaras, the way the colors become pleasant by covering themselves with color, they have been carrying the whole world in their own beauty
 kuch samay pehle tak ye kaarobaar apane charam par tha
 Their toys were exported abroad
 karodon kaa kaarobaar hota tha
 But the government suddenly banned the use of Koi-riya's wood from which these beautiful toys took shape
 maje kii baat ye ki is lakdi kaa jiskaa kisi duusari cheez main istemaal bhi nahin hota
 Despite this, it was banned
 is faisle ke baad se hi khilone se chamak gaayab ho gai
 The toys that had been giving young children for centuries suddenly started showing enemies
 is sarkaar se inhen bahut ummid thi lekin duusari sarkaron kii tarah yahaan bhi inhe niraashaa hi haath lagi
 What to tell the agony story of Ganga and its ghats
 use kehane kaa ji nahin chahta kyonki use to aap sab jaanate hi hai
 Seeing his pain, everyone cries
 kabhi inhen ghaaton par hamaare apane angan ke sapoot nazir banarsi ne ganga ke liye likhaa tha, 'laharaate dabe paanv chali jaati he ganga, kya jaaniye kya gaati he ganga, ja ja ke mere paas palat aati he ganga, milte hai jo afsaane wo duharaati he ganga
 'ganga has been reiterating its plight for decades
 par uski sunne vaala koi nahin
 When Narendra came to his doorstep, looking at the Ganges, he said that my mother had called me
 maa bhi laga kii koi to sapoot aayaa jo uske dard ko mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Namami Gange made a plan, but his desire was strengthened but a year passed
 is darmiyaan sirf assi ghat kii jamaa mitti hi hati
 Everything else remains the same
 kachuva centuri kii vajah se ganga ke baaluu kii nikasi na hone se ghat kaa kataan aisa ho gaya he ki ek dashak baad kabhi bhi kai ghat jameendos ho jaaenge
 This is the truth that if the time is not warned, the consequences will be fatal
 maa ganga ke is dard ko dekh kar mahakavi niraala kii ek pankti yaad aati he ki 'dukh hi jivan kii katha rahi kya kahuun aaj tak jo nahin kahi
 Comments aisa nahin kii pradhanmantri narendra modi ko hamaari is badahaali kaa pataa nahin
 He is well aware and plans for this have also been announced
 par shilnyas or ghoshnaa ke baad shuruyaat ke intazaar main kai yojanaayen hai
 Prominent among them are the 600 crore Teachers Training Center Scheme which was laid by the Prime Minister
 500 karod kii dijal rail ingine vistarikaran kii yojana
 250 crore for the remodeling of Banaras Cantt railway station, with 36 lakhs from MP fund only
 900 karod kii bhumigat cabel yojana
 With the plan of 90 crores under the heart plan, the plan of cleaning the ghats is still waiting for its start till then Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu dreamed of a plan of Rs 18 thousand crores
 venkaiya naidu ke ye nae sapane hai
 The old promises are not visible on the ground right now and a year has passed since the government, but now i am waiting for when our appearance will change
 ham noummid nahin hai
 We are still on the boat of hope that this midstream of the bad will definitely bring the edge of happiness

 The business of Banarasi sarees is about 1 thousand crores with exports of 300 to 400 crores every year
 kabhi ye aankada isse kai guna zyaada tha
 Because then the raw material associated with it was made only in Benaras and many parts of the country
 lekin aaj haalat ye he ki china se yarn aane laga he
 The big irony on this is that the government is levying 25 per cent tax on raw material Chinese yarn, while the finished goods made from this yarn which are coming from China are only taxing 10 per cent which is destroying the industry here

 The weaver from whose debt is never able to recover
 modi ji se unhen ummid jaagi thi lekin haath maayusi hi lagi
 According to a 2007 survey in Banaras, there were about 5255 small large units
 isame sari broked, zaradozi, zari metal, gulabiminakaari, kundankaree, jewelri, pathar kii kataai, glass painting, beeds, dari, karpet, wal hanging, mukut work jaise chote manzole udyog the
 About 20 lakh people used to work in these and this business was 7500 crores
 lekin iname 2257 ikai puri tarah band ho chuki hai or baaki bachi bhi band hone ke kagaar par hai
 But after the coming of the Modi government and emphasizing his Make in India and Skill Development, his talk had brought great expectations to the people associated with these industries
 par bajet main inke liye koi thos upaay na hone kii vajah se ye log behad niraash hai
 The same is true of the wooden toy industry
 apni taraf barabas khinchate ye khilone agar bol sakate to apane gadhane vaale kii bebasii zarur bayaan karte
 The lifeless sticks roaming fast in the Kashmiri street of Banaras, the way the colors become pleasant by covering themselves with color, they have been carrying the whole world in their own beauty
 kuch samay pehle tak ye kaarobaar apane charam par tha
 Their toys were exported abroad
 karodon kaa kaarobaar hota tha
 But the government suddenly banned the use of Koi-riya's wood from which these beautiful toys took shape
 maje kii baat ye ki is lakdi kaa jiskaa kisi duusari cheez main istemaal bhi nahin hota
 Despite this, it was banned
 is faisle ke baad se hi khilone se chamak gaayab ho gai
 The toys that had been giving young children for centuries suddenly started showing enemies
 is sarkaar se inhen bahut ummid thi lekin duusari sarkaron kii tarah yahaan bhi inhe niraashaa hi haath lagi
 What to tell the agony story of Ganga and its ghats
 use kehane kaa ji nahin chahta kyonki use to aap sab jaanate hi hai
 Seeing his pain, everyone cries
 kabhi inhen ghaaton par hamaare apane angan ke sapoot nazir banarsi ne ganga ke liye likhaa tha, 'laharaate dabe paanv chali jaati he ganga, kya jaaniye kya gaati he ganga, ja ja ke mere paas palat aati he ganga, milte hai jo afsaane wo duharaati he ganga
 'ganga has been reiterating its plight for decades
 par uski sunne vaala koi nahin
 When Narendra came to his doorstep, looking at the Ganges, he said that my mother had called me
 maa bhi laga kii koi to sapoot aayaa jo uske dard ko mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Namami Gange made a plan, but his desire was strengthened but a year passed
 is darmiyaan sirf assi ghat kii jamaa mitti hi hati
 Everything else remains the same
 kachuva centuri kii vajah se ganga ke baaluu kii nikasi na hone se ghat kaa kataan aisa ho gaya he ki ek dashak baad kabhi bhi kai ghat jameendos ho jaaenge
 This is the truth that if the time is not warned, the consequences will be fatal
 maa ganga ke is dard ko dekh kar mahakavi niraala kii ek pankti yaad aati he ki 'dukh hi jivan kii katha rahi kya kahuun aaj tak jo nahin kahi

 He is well aware and plans for this have also been announced

 Prominent among them are the 600 crore Teachers Training Center Scheme which was laid by the Prime Minister
 500 karod kii dijal rail ingine vistarikaran kii yojana
 250 crore for the remodeling of Banaras Cantt railway station, with 36 lakhs from MP fund only
 900 karod kii bhumigat cabel yojana
 With the plan of 90 crores under the heart plan, the plan of cleaning the ghats is still waiting for its start till then Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu dreamed of a plan of Rs 18 thousand crores
 venkaiya naidu ke ye nae sapane hai
 The old promises are not visible on the ground right now and a year has passed since the government, but now i am waiting for when our appearance will change
 ham noummid nahin hai
 We are still on the boat of hope that this midstream of the bad will definitely bring the edge of happiness
 pradhanmantri ke liye hamaare shahar yani apane hi sansadeey kshetra main kooda prabandhan ek badi chunauti bani hui he
 The condition of Karsara and Ramna plant is in a bad state
 kooda nistaaran ke liye nagar nigam ke paas upyukt thikaana nahin he
 The city is of narrow streets
 yahaan kooda ghar ke liye khaali jagah nahin milti
 There is also difficulty in keeping the container
 kooda ghar dhwast hai aise main har rose 600 metric ton nikalne vaala kooda sadakon or galiyon ke bich logon ke naak main dam kiye hue he or ye haal tab he jab pichley kai dashakon se hamaare saansad, vidhayak or meyar bijepi ke hi rahe hai
 Who are still showing the dreams of clean and beautiful Kashi, not only of these garbage
 bijepi ke netaaon ko modi main rab dikhataa he to dikhe
 Kashi belongs to Shiva and i know the whole reality
 kabhi mere angan main aakar modi ne kaha tha ki unhen to ganga ne bulaayaa he
 He came even when he became Prime Minister
 mere assi ghat par
 Also picked up the broom
 fawda bhi chalaaya
 He promised to save the Ganges from which people get salvation, when they are being killed by the weapons of pollution
 lekin vaade hai, vaadon kaa kya
 Whenever my fingers touch the Ganges, i feel the pain and pollution brought to my soul
 modi aae the
 Will also come tomorrow
 lekin hamaara dard to jas kaa tas he
 My villages are still backward today
 unamem se hi ek pichde gaanv jayapur ko pradhanmantri modi ne god liya tha
 i was also happy that one of my villages would be rejuvenated
 ye kushi haqiqat main bhi badalati dikh rahi he vahaan sadake bijli pani ke saath duusari buniyadi suvidhaayen shaharon jaisi ho gai he
 But we tell you the reality of our city, how the city has lost its life due to dusty roads and dust
 agar aap saans ke rogi, dama or asthma se peedit he or in dinon apane pradhanmantri ke sansadeey kshetra main aana chaahate hai to sanbhal ke aaen kyonki yahaan kii hawa main ud rahe dhul ke kan or gadiyon ke carbon aap kii beemaari ko badha sakate hai
 And those who do not suffer from these diseases should also be cautious as the Banaras Fiza has been polluted to dangerous levels
 ye bate ham hi nahin pradooshan vibhaag bhi kah rahaa he
 TN Singh of the Pollution Department says that there is a vascular pollution, vehicles coming into the city, excavation has been going on in the city of Benaras for decades, its parts are flying, there is a problem with genset, it also has a great effect It is falling and Menali who is having Vascular Pollution is counting 80 to 85 percent

 This is a very dangerous sign

 No one knows this, except when i am there, as there is no existence of Shiva
 main shiv ke trishul basii hum yaa sheshnag ke fan par, isapar log baaten karte hai lekin ek vakt tha ki aryavart kaa koi bhi shahar mujhase zyada anushaasit, sabhy or tarakkee vaala nahin tha
 But today there is a lot of population pressure in my narrow streets
 gadiyon kaa aana janaa bhi bahut he
 According to a rough estimate, there are about 11 lakh scooters and motor cycles
 1 lakh se upar car or jeep hai, tractor 5300 hazaar he to trailor 10 hazaar
 Similarly, there are trucks and buses whose diseases are increasing due to smoke
 aajkal ke dhanvantari bataate hai ki in dinon saans or or dame ke marij mere shahar main bahut bad gaye hai
 In the midst of all this, the problem of sewer is leprous

 Their water is on the roads

 This misery is not just about the ravaged, dusty road and sewer

 We are still on the boat of hope that this midstream of the bad will definitely bring the edge of happiness
 mere gaanv aaj bhi pichde hai
 One of the backward villages, Jayapur, was adopted by Prime Minister Modi
 mujhe bhi khushi hui ki mere ek gaanv kaa kayakalp ho jayega
 This happiness is indeed changing in reality as well, along with rotting seed water, other basic facilities have become like cities
 par ham aapako ye apane shahar kii haqiqat bataate hai ki kaise khastahal sadak or dhul kii vajah se shahar kii zindagi bezaar ho gai he
 If you are suffering from respiratory disease, asthma and asthma and want to come to your Prime Minister's Parliamentary constituency these days, then be careful because the dust mites in the air and the carbon of the vehicles can increase your disease
 or jo log in bimariyon se grast nahin hai wo bhi satark rahen kyonki banaras kii fizaa khatarnaak str tak pradooshit ho chuki he
 Not only these things, the pollution department is also saying this
 pradooshan vibhaag ke tii en singh bataate he ki vascular polution he, jo gaadiyaan shahar main aa rahi hai, banaras shahar main dashakon se khudaai chal rahi he, uske jo partical hai wo ud rahe hai, jensett se bahut samasya he, uskaa bhi bahut asar pad rahaa he or menley jo vascular polution he wo 80 se 85 fisadi count kar rahaa he
 Surprising figures of this poison dissolving in the air of Banaras came to light when Prime Minister Narendra Modi implemented the National Air Quality Index a week ago
 iske suchakank bataa rahe hai ki banaras kii fijaa saans lene laayak nahin he
 The sensor of the orderly market index of Banaras shows that the average of the quantity of PM10 is 244 microns per cubic centimeter
 yah nunatam 110 or adhiktam 427 darz kiya gaya
 While its level should be less than 60 microns per cubic centimeter
 isi tarah 10 micron se chote aakaar ke dhul ke kan maanak se 7 guna zyaada paae gaye
 PM2 in that order
 5 kii maatra kaa ausat mila 220
 Its minimum 50 and maximum 500 were recorded in 24 hours, while its volume should be less than 40
 yani ye maanak se 12 guna adhik he
 On how dangerous the particles dissolved in air, BH Tripathi BD Tripathi says, 'particulate matter size which should be 100 microns per cubic centimeter is getting 300 to 400
 ye bahut khatarnaak dyotak he
 It indicates that the air of Banaras is not breathable
 jaise shiv ke astitv kaa koi aadi nahin he vaise hi main kab se hum, ye mere sivaa kisi ko pataa nahin
 Whether i live on Shiva's trident or on Sheshnag's fun, people talk about it, but there was a time that no city of Aryavarta was more disciplined, civilized and progressing than me
 lekin aaj meri sankari galiyon main aabaadi kaa dabaav bahut he
 There is also a lot of vehicles coming and going
 ek mote anumaan ke mutabiq taqariban 11 lakh scooter or motor cycle he
 There are cars and jeeps above 1 lakh, tractor is 5300 thousand then trailer is 10 thousand
 isi tarah trek or based hai jinke dhuon se bimaariyaan bad rahi hai
 Today's Dhanwantari says that these days, patients with breathlessness and asthma have increased a lot in my city
 in sabake bich siver kii samasya kodh main khaaj he
 The pipeline is broken in place
 unka pani sadakon par he
 Sewer water is also found in the supply of water in the houses, which people are forced to drink
 ye badahaali sirf khastahal, dhul bhari sadak or siver kii hi nahin he
 Rather, while passing through the street of Thatheri Bazar of our own courtyard, narrated the story of more than two dozen arts like chisel hammer sound, cow slang, Mughal fallacy, Bengali nakhas, gadi work, utensil work, takka work
 Used to do lekin aaj yahaan sannata he
 The same situation is with the weavers
 banarsi sari kaa kaarobaar taqariban 1 hazaar karod kaa he jisamen 300 se 400 karod kaa har saal export hota he
 Sometimes this figure was many times more
 kyonki tab isse jude ro material banaras or desh ke kai hisson main hi banataa tha
 But today the situation is that yarn has started coming from China 
 is par badi vidmbana ye he ki kachche maal chinis yarn par to sarkaar 25 fisadi tex laga rahi he jabaki isi dhaage se bane taiyaar maal jo china se aa rahaa he us par sirf 10 fisadi tex laga rahi he jo yahaan ke udyog ko khatm kar rahaa he
 This hall is of yarns made in the country like polyester, nylon, cotton, mercerized, viscose
 jiske karj se bunakar kabhi ubar nahin paata
 He had aroused hope from Modi ji, but he felt disappointed
 banaras main 2007 ke survey ke mutabiq takreeban 5255 choti badi ikai thi
 There were small medium industries such as saree brocade, zardozi, zari metal, pink minting, kundankari, jewelery, stone cutting, glass painting, beads, carpets, carpets, wall hanging, crown work
 inamen taqariban 20 lakh log kaam karte the or ye kaarobaar 7500 karod kaa tha
 But the 2257 unit has been completely closed and the remaining are on the verge of closure
 lekin modi sarkaar aane ke baad or unke mek in india or skill development par jor detii unki baton ne in udyogon se jude logon ko badi ummiden dilaai thi
 But these people are very disappointed due to no concrete measures for them in the budget
 yahi haal lakdi ke khilone ke udyog kaa he
 If you could say these toys while pulling them, then you would definitely tell your builder's helplessness
 banaras ke kashmiri gali main teji se gumti ye bejaan lakadiyaan jis tarah rangon ko apane par odh kar khushnuma banati hai vaise hi ye puri duniya ko apni khubsuurati se apane bas main karti rahi hai
 Until some time ago, this business was at its peak
 inke banaae khilone videshon main niryaat hote the
 There was a business of crores
 lekin sarkaar ne achaanak koi-raiya kii us lakdi ke istemaal par roak laga diya jisase ye khubasurat khilone aakaar lete the
 The interesting thing is that this wood which is not used in anything else
 baavjood iske is par roak laga di gai
 The glow disappeared from the toy only after this decision
 sadiyon se jo khilone bacchon ko jawan karte aae the achaanak wo dushman nazar aane lage
 He expected a lot from this government, but like other governments, he too got frustrated
 ganga or uske ghaaton kii vyathaa katha kya kahuun
 i do not want to tell him because you all know him
 uske dard ko dekh kar har kisi ko ronaa aata he
 At these ghats, the son of our own courtyard Nazir Banarsi wrote for the Ganges, 'the waving leaves the Ganges, what you know, what the Ganga sings, the Ganga comes to me, the Ganges comes, repeating the rumors The Ganges ' ganga dashakon se apni badahaali ke afsaane duhara rahi he
 But there is no one to listen to him
 narendra jab uski dahalij par aaye the to ganga ko hi dekh kar kaha tha kii mujhe to maa ne hi bulaayaa he
 Mother also felt that there was some son who was feeling his pain
 namaami gange yojana bani to uski ye ichha or balwati hui par ek saal guzar gaya
 During this time only the deposits of eighty ghats were removed
 baaki sab jas kaa tas he
 Due to lack of drainage of the Ganga sand due to the Kachuva Century, the ghats have become such that many ghats will be destroyed in a decade
 ye aisa sach he jisase samay rahete nahin cheta gaya to parinaam ghaatak hi honge
 Seeing this pain of mother Ganga, one line of Mahakavi Nirala remembers that 'sorrow is the story of life, what to say, what i have not said till date
 'tippaniyan It is not that Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not know about our plight
 unhen bakhubi maaloom he or iske liye yojanaon kii ghoshnaa bhi hui
 But after the Shilanyas and the announcement there are many plans waiting for the beginning
 iname pramukh hai BHU main 600 karod kii teachers training centre yojana jiskaa shilnyas pradhanmantri ne kiya tha
 500 crore diesel rail engine expansion plan
 250 karod main banaras kaint railway stesan ke remodeling kii yojana jisamen sirf saansad nidhi se 36 lakh lage hai
 900 crore underground cable scheme
 hryday yojana ke tahat 90 karod kii yojana ke saath ghaaton kii safai kii yojana abhi apane shuruyaat kaa intazaar hi kar rahi he tab tak kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu 18 hazaar karod rupee kii yojana kaa sapana dikhaa gaye
 These are the new dreams of Venkaiah Naidu
 puraane vaade abhi jameen par dikhaai nahin pad rahe or sarkaar kaa ek saal biit gaya par abhi main intazaar kar rahaa hum ki aakhir kab hamaari surat badalegi
 We are not hopeless
 ham abhi bhi ummid ke naav par savaar hai ki badahaali ke is majdhaar se khushhaali kaa kinaaraa zarur aayega
 My villages are still backward today
 unamem se hi ek pichde gaanv jayapur ko pradhanmantri modi ne god liya tha
 i was also happy that one of my villages would be rejuvenated
 ye kushi haqiqat main bhi badalati dikh rahi he vahaan sadake bijli pani ke saath duusari buniyadi suvidhaayen shaharon jaisi ho gai he
 But we tell you the reality of our city, how the city has lost its life due to dusty roads and dust
 agar aap saans ke rogi, dama or asthma se peedit he or in dinon apane pradhanmantri ke sansadeey kshetra main aana chaahate hai to sanbhal ke aaen kyonki yahaan kii hawa main ud rahe dhul ke kan or gadiyon ke carbon aap kii beemaari ko badha sakate hai
 And those who do not suffer from these diseases should also be cautious as the Banaras Fiza has been polluted to dangerous levels
 ye bate ham hi nahin pradooshan vibhaag bhi kah rahaa he
 TN Singh of the Pollution Department says that there is a vascular pollution, vehicles coming into the city, excavation has been going on in the city of Benaras for decades, its parts are flying, there is a problem with genset, it also has a great effect It is falling and Menali who is having Vascular Pollution is counting 80 to 85 percent
 banaras kii hawa main ghulte is zehar ke hairaan karne vaale aankade tab saamne aae jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek hafte pehle rashtriya vaayu gunvattta suchakank lagu kiya
 Its indices suggest that the fijas of Banaras are not breathable
 banaras ke ardli bazaar sthit suchakank kaa sensor bataata he ki piem 10 kii maatra kaa ausat 244 micron prati ghan centimetre he
 It recorded a minimum of 110 and a maximum of 427
 jabaki iskaa str 60 micron prati ghan centimetre se kam hona chaiye
 Similarly, dust particles smaller than 10 microns were found to be 7 times more than the standard
 isi kram main piem 2
 The average volume of 5 was 220
 choubees ghante main iskaa nunatam 50 or adhiktam 500 record kiya gaya jabaki isaki maatra 40 se kam honi chaiye
 That is, it is 12 times more than the standard
 hawa main ghule partical kitne khatarnaak hai, is par biechayu ke profesar bi di treepathi kehete hai, 'particulet matter kaa saise jisko kii 100 micron prati ghan centimetre hona chaiye wo 300 se 400 mil rahaa he
 This is a very dangerous sign
 ye indicate karata he ki banaras kii hawa saans lene laayak nahin he
 No one knows this, except when i am there, as there is no existence of Shiva
 main shiv ke trishul basii hum yaa sheshnag ke fan par, isapar log baaten karte hai lekin ek vakt tha ki aryavart kaa koi bhi shahar mujhase zyada anushaasit, sabhy or tarakkee vaala nahin tha
 But today there is a lot of population pressure in my narrow streets
 gadiyon kaa aana janaa bhi bahut he
 According to a rough estimate, there are about 11 lakh scooters and motor cycles
 1 lakh se upar car or jeep hai, tractor 5300 hazaar he to trailor 10 hazaar
 Similarly, there are trucks and buses whose diseases are increasing due to smoke
 aajkal ke dhanvantari bataate hai ki in dinon saans or or dame ke marij mere shahar main bahut bad gaye hai
 In the midst of all this, the problem of sewer is leprous
 jagah-jagah pipe line toote he
 Their water is on the roads
 gharon main jo pani kii supplai he usamen bhi siver kaa pani mil jaataa he jise log pine ke liye majboor hai
 This misery is not just about the ravaged, dusty road and sewer
 balki hamaare apane angan ke thatheri bazaar kii gali main kabhi guzarate vaqt chheni hathaudi si nikalne vaali awaz, gop kii binawat, mogul parataji, bengali nakhaas, gadhaai kaa kaam, bartan kaa kaam, tabak ke kaam jaise do darjan se zyada kalaon kii daastaan sunaaya karti thi
 But today there is silence here
 yahi haal bunakaron kaa he
 The business of Banarasi sarees is about 1 thousand crores with exports of 300 to 400 crores every year
 kabhi ye aankada isse kai guna zyaada tha
 Because then the raw material associated with it was made only in Benaras and many parts of the country
 lekin aaj haalat ye he ki china se yarn aane laga he
 The big irony on this is that the government is levying 25 per cent tax on raw material Chinese yarn, while the finished goods made from this yarn which are coming from China are only taxing 10 per cent which is destroying the industry here
 is
 yahi haul polister, nylon, coton, marsraiced, viscorse, jaise desh main banane vaale dhaagon kaa he
 The weaver from whose debt is never able to recover
 modi ji se unhen ummid jaagi thi lekin haath maayusi hi lagi
 According to a 2007 survey in Banaras, there were about 5255 small large units
 isame sari broked, zaradozi, zari metal, gulabiminakaari, kundankaree, jewelri, pathar kii kataai, glass painting, beeds, dari, karpet, wal hanging, mukut work jaise chote manzole udyog the
 About 20 lakh people used to work in these and this business was 7500 crores
 lekin iname 2257 ikai puri tarah band ho chuki hai or baaki bachi bhi band hone ke kagaar par hai
 But after the coming of the Modi government and emphasizing his Make in India and Skill Development, his talk had brought great expectations to the people associated with these industries
 par bajet main inke liye koi thos upaay na hone kii vajah se ye log behad niraash hai
 The same is true of the wooden toy industry
 apni taraf barabas khinchate ye khilone agar bol sakate to apane gadhane vaale kii bebasii zarur bayaan karte
 The lifeless sticks roaming fast in the Kashmiri street of Banaras, the way the colors become pleasant by covering themselves with color, they have been carrying the whole world in their own beauty
 kuch samay pehle tak ye kaarobaar apane charam par tha
 Their toys were exported abroad
 karodon kaa kaarobaar hota tha
 But the government suddenly banned the use of Koi-riya's wood from which these beautiful toys took shape
 maje kii baat ye ki is lakdi kaa jiskaa kisi duusari cheez main istemaal bhi nahin hota
 Despite this, it was banned
 is faisle ke baad se hi khilone se chamak gaayab ho gai
 The toys that had been giving young children for centuries suddenly started showing enemies
 is sarkaar se inhen bahut ummid thi lekin duusari sarkaron kii tarah yahaan bhi inhe niraashaa hi haath lagi
 What to tell the agony story of Ganga and its ghats
 use kehane kaa ji nahin chahta kyonki use to aap sab jaanate hi hai
 Seeing his pain, everyone cries
 kabhi inhen ghaaton par hamaare apane angan ke sapoot nazir banarsi ne ganga ke liye likhaa tha, 'laharaate dabe paanv chali jaati he ganga, kya jaaniye kya gaati he ganga, ja ja ke mere paas palat aati he ganga, milte hai jo afsaane wo duharaati he ganga
 'ganga has been reiterating its plight for decades
 par uski sunne vaala koi nahin
 When Narendra came to his doorstep, looking at the Ganges, he said that my mother had called me
 maa bhi laga kii koi to sapoot aayaa jo uske dard ko mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Namami Gange made a plan, but his desire was strengthened but a year passed
 is darmiyaan sirf assi ghat kii jamaa mitti hi hati
 Everything else remains the same
 kachuva centuri kii vajah se ganga ke baaluu kii nikasi na hone se ghat kaa kataan aisa ho gaya he ki ek dashak baad kabhi bhi kai ghat jameendos ho jaaenge
 This is the truth that if the time is not warned, the consequences will be fatal
 maa ganga ke is dard ko dekh kar mahakavi niraala kii ek pankti yaad aati he ki 'dukh hi jivan kii katha rahi kya kahuun aaj tak jo nahin kahi
 Comments aisa nahin kii pradhanmantri narendra modi ko hamaari is badahaali kaa pataa nahin
 He is well aware and plans for this have also been announced
 par shilnyas or ghoshnaa ke baad shuruyaat ke intazaar main kai yojanaayen hai
 Prominent among them are the 600 crore Teachers Training Center Scheme which was laid by the Prime Minister
 500 karod kii dijal rail ingine vistarikaran kii yojana
 250 crore for the remodeling of Banaras Cantt railway station, with 36 lakhs from MP fund only
 900 karod kii bhumigat cabel yojana
 With the plan of 90 crores under the heart plan, the plan of cleaning the ghats is still waiting for its start till then Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu dreamed of a plan of Rs 18 thousand crores
 venkaiya naidu ke ye nae sapane hai
 The old promises are not visible on the ground right now and a year has passed since the government, but now i am waiting for when our appearance will change
 ham noummid nahin hai
 We are still on the boat of hope that this midstream of the bad will definitely bring the edge of happiness
 pradooshan vibhaag ke tii en singh bataate he ki vascular polution he, jo gaadiyaan shahar main aa rahi hai, banaras shahar main dashakon se khudaai chal rahi he, uske jo partical hai wo ud rahe hai, jensett se bahut samasya he, uskaa bhi bahut asar pad rahaa he or menley jo vascular polution he wo 80 se 85 fisadi count kar rahaa he
 Surprising figures of this poison dissolving in the air of Banaras came to light when Prime Minister Narendra Modi implemented the National Air Quality Index a week ago
 iske suchakank bataa rahe hai ki banaras kii fijaa saans lene laayak nahin he
 The sensor of the orderly market index of Banaras shows that the average of the quantity of PM10 is 244 microns per cubic centimeter
 yah nunatam 110 or adhiktam 427 darz kiya gaya
 While its level should be less than 60 microns per cubic centimeter
 isi tarah 10 micron se chote aakaar ke dhul ke kan maanak se 7 guna zyaada paae gaye
 PM2 in that order
 5 kii maatra kaa ausat mila 220
 Its minimum 50 and maximum 500 were recorded in 24 hours, while its volume should be less than 40
 yani ye maanak se 12 guna adhik he
 On how dangerous the particles dissolved in air, BH Tripathi BD Tripathi says, 'particulate matter size which should be 100 microns per cubic centimeter is getting 300 to 400
 ye bahut khatarnaak dyotak he
 It indicates that the air of Banaras is not breathable
 jaise shiv ke astitv kaa koi aadi nahin he vaise hi main kab se hum, ye mere sivaa kisi ko pataa nahin
 Whether i live on Shiva's trident or on Sheshnag's fun, people talk about it, but there was a time that no city of Aryavarta was more disciplined, civilized and progressing than me
 lekin aaj meri sankari galiyon main aabaadi kaa dabaav bahut he
 There is also a lot of vehicles coming and going
 ek mote anumaan ke mutabiq taqariban 11 lakh scooter or motor cycle he
 There are cars and jeeps above 1 lakh, tractor is 5300 thousand then trailer is 10 thousand
 isi tarah trek or based hai jinke dhuon se bimaariyaan bad rahi hai
 Today's Dhanwantari says that these days, patients with breathlessness and asthma have increased a lot in my city
 in sabake bich siver kii samasya kodh main khaaj he
 The pipeline is broken in place
 unka pani sadakon par he
 Sewer water is also found in the supply of water in the houses, which people are forced to drink
 ye badahaali sirf khastahal, dhul bhari sadak or siver kii hi nahin he
 Rather, while passing through the street of Thatheri Bazar of our own courtyard, narrated the story of more than two dozen arts like chisel hammer sound, cow slang, Mughal fallacy, Bengali nakhas, gadi work, utensil work, takka work
 Used to do lekin aaj yahaan sannata he
 The same situation is with the weavers
 banarsi sari kaa kaarobaar taqariban 1 hazaar karod kaa he jisamen 300 se 400 karod kaa har saal export hota he
 Sometimes this figure was many times more
 kyonki tab isse jude ro material banaras or desh ke kai hisson main hi banataa tha
 But today the condition is that yarn has started coming from China
 is par badi vidmbana ye he ki kachche maal chinis yarn par to sarkaar 25 fisadi tex laga rahi he jabaki isi dhaage se bane taiyaar maal jo china se aa rahaa he us par sirf 10 fisadi tex laga rahi he jo yahaan ke udyog ko khatm kar rahaa he
 This hall is of yarns made in the country like polyester, nylon, cotton, mercerized, viscose
 jiske karj se bunakar kabhi ubar nahin paata
 He had aroused hope from Modi ji, but he felt disappointed
 banaras main 2007 ke survey ke mutabiq takreeban 5255 choti badi ikai thi
 There were small medium industries such as saree brocade, zardozi, zari metal, pink minting, kundankari, jewelery, stone cutting, glass painting, beads, carpets, carpets, wall hanging, crown work

 We are not hopeless
 ham abhi bhi ummid ke naav par savaar hai ki badahaali ke is majdhaar se khushhaali kaa kinaaraa zarur aayega
 No one knows this, except when i am there, as there is no existence of Shiva
 main shiv ke trishul basii hum yaa sheshnag ke fan par, isapar log baaten karte hai lekin ek vakt tha ki aryavart kaa koi bhi shahar mujhase zyada anushaasit, sabhy or tarakkee vaala nahin tha
 But today there is a lot of population pressure in my narrow streets
 gadiyon kaa aana janaa bhi bahut he
 According to a rough estimate, there are about 11 lakh scooters and motor cycles
 1 lakh se upar car or jeep hai, tractor 5300 hazaar he to trailor 10 hazaar
 Similarly, there are trucks and buses whose diseases are increasing due to smoke
 aajkal ke dhanvantari bataate hai ki in dinon saans or or dame ke marij mere shahar main bahut bad gaye hai
 In the midst of all this, the problem of sewer is leprous
 jagah-jagah pipe line toote he
 Their water is on the roads
 gharon main jo pani kii supplai he usamen bhi siver kaa pani mil jaataa he jise log pine ke liye majboor hai
 This misery is not just about the ravaged, dusty road and sewer
 balki hamaare apane angan ke thatheri bazaar kii gali main kabhi guzarate vaqt chheni hathaudi si nikalne vaali awaz, gop kii binawat, mogul parataji, bengali nakhaas, gadhaai kaa kaam, bartan kaa kaam, tabak ke kaam jaise do darjan se zyada kalaon kii daastaan sunaaya karti thi
 But today there is silence here
 yahi haal bunakaron kaa he
 The business of Banarasi sarees is about 1 thousand crores with exports of 300 to 400 crores every year
 kabhi ye aankada isse kai guna zyaada tha
 Because then the raw material associated with it was made only in Benaras and many parts of the country
 lekin aaj haalat ye he ki china se yarn aane laga he
 The big irony on this is that the government is levying 25 per cent tax on raw material Chinese yarn, while the finished goods made from this yarn which are coming from China are only taxing 10 per cent which is destroying the industry here
 is
 yahi haul polister, nylon, coton, marsraiced, viscorse, jaise desh main banane vaale dhaagon kaa he
 The weaver from whose debt is never able to recover
 modi ji se unhen ummid jaagi thi lekin haath maayusi hi lagi
 According to a 2007 survey in Banaras, there were about 5255 small large units
 isame sari broked, zaradozi, zari metal, gulabiminakaari, kundankaree, jewelri, pathar kii kataai, glass painting, beeds, dari, karpet, wal hanging, mukut work jaise chote manzole udyog the
 About 20 lakh people used to work in these and this business was 7500 crores
 lekin iname 2257 ikai puri tarah band ho chuki hai or baaki bachi bhi band hone ke kagaar par hai
 But after the coming of the Modi government and emphasizing his Make in India and Skill Development, his talk had brought great expectations to the people associated with these industries
 par bajet main inke liye koi thos upaay na hone kii vajah se ye log behad niraash hai
 The same is true of the wooden toy industry
 apni taraf barabas khinchate ye khilone agar bol sakate to apane gadhane vaale kii bebasii zarur bayaan karte
 The lifeless sticks roaming fast in the Kashmiri street of Banaras, the way the colors become pleasant by covering themselves with color, they have been carrying the whole world in their own beauty
 kuch samay pehle tak ye kaarobaar apane charam par tha
 Their toys were exported abroad
 karodon kaa kaarobaar hota tha
 But the government suddenly banned the use of Koi-riya's wood from which these beautiful toys took shape
 maje kii baat ye ki is lakdi kaa jiskaa kisi duusari cheez main istemaal bhi nahin hota
 Despite this, it was banned
 is faisle ke baad se hi khilone se chamak gaayab ho gai
 The toys that had been giving young children for centuries suddenly started showing enemies
 is sarkaar se inhen bahut ummid thi lekin duusari sarkaron kii tarah yahaan bhi inhe niraashaa hi haath lagi
 What to tell the agony story of Ganga and its ghats
 use kehane kaa ji nahin chahta kyonki use to aap sab jaanate hi hai
 Seeing his pain, everyone cries
 kabhi inhen ghaaton par hamaare apane angan ke sapoot nazir banarsi ne ganga ke liye likhaa tha, 'laharaate dabe paanv chali jaati he ganga, kya jaaniye kya gaati he ganga, ja ja ke mere paas palat aati he ganga, milte hai jo afsaane wo duharaati he ganga
 'ganga has been reiterating its plight for decades
 par uski sunne vaala koi nahin
 When Narendra came to his doorstep, looking at the Ganges, he said that my mother had called me
 maa bhi laga kii koi to sapoot aayaa jo uske dard ko mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Namami Gange made a plan, but his desire was strengthened but a year passed
 is darmiyaan sirf assi ghat kii jamaa mitti hi hati
 Everything else remains the same
 kachuva centuri kii vajah se ganga ke baaluu kii nikasi na hone se ghat kaa kataan aisa ho gaya he ki ek dashak baad kabhi bhi kai ghat jameendos ho jaaenge
 This is the truth that if the time is not warned, the consequences will be fatal
 maa ganga ke is dard ko dekh kar mahakavi niraala kii ek pankti yaad aati he ki 'dukh hi jivan kii katha rahi kya kahuun aaj tak jo nahin kahi
 Comments aisa nahin kii pradhanmantri narendra modi ko hamaari is badahaali kaa pataa nahin
 He is well aware and plans for this have also been announced
 par shilnyas or ghoshnaa ke baad shuruyaat ke intazaar main kai yojanaayen hai
 Prominent among them are the 600 crore Teachers Training Center Scheme which was laid by the Prime Minister
 500 karod kii dijal rail ingine vistarikaran kii yojana
 250 crore for the remodeling of Banaras Cantt railway station, with 36 lakhs from MP fund only
 900 karod kii bhumigat cabel yojana
 With the plan of 90 crores under the heart plan, the plan of cleaning the ghats is still waiting for its start till then Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu dreamed of a plan of Rs 18 thousand crores
 venkaiya naidu ke ye nae sapane hai
 The old promises are not visible on the ground right now and a year has passed since the government, but now i am waiting for when our appearance will change
 ham noummid nahin hai
 We are still on the boat of hope that this midstream of the bad will definitely bring the edge of happiness
 in sabake bich siver kii samasya kodh main khaaj he
 The pipeline is broken in place
 unka pani sadakon par he
 Sewer water is also found in the supply of water in the houses, which people are forced to drink
 ye badahaali sirf khastahal, dhul bhari sadak or siver kii hi nahin he
 Rather, while passing through the street of Thatheri Bazar of our own courtyard, narrated the story of more than two dozen arts like chisel hammer sound, cow slang, Mughal fallacy, Bengali nakhas, gadi work, utensil work, takka work
 Used to do lekin aaj yahaan sannata he
 The same situation is with the weavers
 banarsi sari kaa kaarobaar taqariban 1 hazaar karod kaa he jisamen 300 se 400 karod kaa har saal export hota he
 Sometimes this figure was many times more
 kyonki tab isse jude ro material banaras or desh ke kai hisson main hi banataa tha
 But today the condition is that yarn has started coming from China
 is par badi vidmbana ye he ki kachche maal chinis yarn par to sarkaar 25 fisadi tex laga rahi he jabaki isi dhaage se bane taiyaar maal jo china se aa rahaa he us par sirf 10 fisadi tex laga rahi he jo yahaan ke udyog ko khatm kar rahaa he
 This hall is of yarns made in the country like polyester, nylon, cotton, mercerized, viscose
 jiske karj se bunakar kabhi ubar nahin paata
 He had aroused hope from Modi ji, but he felt disappointed
 banaras main 2007 ke survey ke mutabiq takreeban 5255 choti badi ikai thi
 There were small medium industries such as saree brocade, zardozi, zari metal, pink minting, kundankari, jewelery, stone cutting, glass painting, beads, carpets, carpets, wall hanging, crown work
 inamen taqariban 20 lakh log kaam karte the or ye kaarobaar 7500 karod kaa tha
 But the 2257 unit has been completely closed and the remaining are on the verge of closure
 lekin modi sarkaar aane ke baad or unke mek in india or skill development par jor detii unki baton ne in udyogon se jude logon ko badi ummiden dilaai thi
 But these people are very disappointed due to no concrete measures for them in the budget
 yahi haal lakdi ke khilone ke udyog kaa he
 If you could say these toys while pulling them, then you would definitely tell your builder's helplessness
 banaras ke kashmiri gali main teji se gumti ye bejaan lakadiyaan jis tarah rangon ko apane par odh kar khushnuma banati hai vaise hi ye puri duniya ko apni khubsuurati se apane bas main karti rahi hai

 The interesting thing is that this wood which is not used in anything else
 baavjood iske is par roak laga di gai
 The glow disappeared from the toy only after this decision
 sadiyon se jo khilone bacchon ko jawan karte aae the achaanak wo dushman nazar aane lage

 Mother also felt that there was some son who was feeling his pain

 During this time only the deposits of eighty ghats were removed

 These are the new dreams of Venkaiah Naidu
 puraane vaade abhi jameen par dikhaai nahin pad rahe or sarkaar kaa ek saal biit gaya par abhi main intazaar kar rahaa hum ki aakhir kab hamaari surat badalegi
 We are not hopeless
 ham abhi bhi ummid ke naav par savaar hai ki badahaali ke is majdhaar se khushhaali kaa kinaaraa zarur aayega
 According to a 2007 survey in Banaras, there were about 5255 small large units
 isame sari broked, zaradozi, zari metal, gulabiminakaari, kundankaree, jewelri, pathar kii kataai, glass painting, beeds, dari, karpet, wal hanging, mukut work jaise chote manzole udyog the
 About 20 lakh people used to work in these and this business was 7500 crores
 lekin iname 2257 ikai puri tarah band ho chuki hai or baaki bachi bhi band hone ke kagaar par hai
 But after the coming of the Modi government and emphasizing his Make in India and Skill Development, his talk had brought great expectations to the people associated with these industries
 par bajet main inke liye koi thos upaay na hone kii vajah se ye log behad niraash hai
 The same is true of the wooden toy industry
 apni taraf barabas khinchate ye khilone agar bol sakate to apane gadhane vaale kii bebasii zarur bayaan karte
 The lifeless sticks roaming fast in the Kashmiri street of Banaras, the way the colors become pleasant by covering themselves with color, they have been carrying the whole world in their own beauty
 kuch samay pehle tak ye kaarobaar apane charam par tha
 Their toys were exported abroad
 karodon kaa kaarobaar hota tha
 But the government suddenly banned the use of Koi-riya's wood from which these beautiful toys took shape
 maje kii baat ye ki is lakdi kaa jiskaa kisi duusari cheez main istemaal bhi nahin hota
 Despite this, it was banned
 is faisle ke baad se hi khilone se chamak gaayab ho gai
 The toys that had been giving young children for centuries suddenly started showing enemies
 is sarkaar se inhen bahut ummid thi lekin duusari sarkaron kii tarah yahaan bhi inhe niraashaa hi haath lagi
 What to tell the agony story of Ganga and its ghats
 use kehane kaa ji nahin chahta kyonki use to aap sab jaanate hi hai
 Seeing his pain, everyone cries
 kabhi inhen ghaaton par hamaare apane angan ke sapoot nazir banarsi ne ganga ke liye likhaa tha, 'laharaate dabe paanv chali jaati he ganga, kya jaaniye kya gaati he ganga, ja ja ke mere paas palat aati he ganga, milte hai jo afsaane wo duharaati he ganga
 'ganga has been reiterating its plight for decades
 par uski sunne vaala koi nahin
 When Narendra came to his doorstep, looking at the Ganges, he said that my mother had called me
 maa bhi laga kii koi to sapoot aayaa jo uske dard ko mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Namami Gange made a plan, but his desire was strengthened but a year passed
 is darmiyaan sirf assi ghat kii jamaa mitti hi hati
 Everything else remains the same
 kachuva centuri kii vajah se ganga ke baaluu kii nikasi na hone se ghat kaa kataan aisa ho gaya he ki ek dashak baad kabhi bhi kai ghat jameendos ho jaaenge
 This is the truth that if the time is not warned, the consequences will be fatal
 maa ganga ke is dard ko dekh kar mahakavi niraala kii ek pankti yaad aati he ki 'dukh hi jivan kii katha rahi kya kahuun aaj tak jo nahin kahi
 Comments aisa nahin kii pradhanmantri narendra modi ko hamaari is badahaali kaa pataa nahin
 He is well aware and plans for this have also been announced
 par shilnyas or ghoshnaa ke baad shuruyaat ke intazaar main kai yojanaayen hai
 Prominent among them are the 600 crore Teachers Training Center Scheme which was laid by the Prime Minister
 500 karod kii dijal rail ingine vistarikaran kii yojana
 250 crore for the remodeling of Banaras Cantt railway station, with 36 lakhs from MP fund only
 900 karod kii bhumigat cabel yojana
 With the plan of 90 crores under the heart plan, the plan of cleaning the ghats is still waiting for its start till then Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu dreamed of a plan of Rs 18 thousand crores
 venkaiya naidu ke ye nae sapane hai
 The old promises are not visible on the ground right now and a year has passed since the government, but now i am waiting for when our appearance will change
 ham noummid nahin hai
 We are still on the boat of hope that this midstream of the bad will definitely bring the edge of happiness
 yahi haal lakdi ke khilone ke udyog kaa he
 If you could say these toys while pulling them, then you would definitely tell your builder's helplessness
 banaras ke kashmiri gali main teji se gumti ye bejaan lakadiyaan jis tarah rangon ko apane par odh kar khushnuma banati hai vaise hi ye puri duniya ko apni khubsuurati se apane bas main karti rahi hai
 Until some time ago, this business was at its peak
 inke banaae khilone videshon main niryaat hote the
 There was a business of crores
 lekin sarkaar ne achaanak koi-raiya kii us lakdi ke istemaal par roak laga diya jisase ye khubasurat khilone aakaar lete the
 The interesting thing is that this wood which is not used in anything else
 baavjood iske is par roak laga di gai
 The glow disappeared from the toy only after this decision
 sadiyon se jo khilone bacchon ko jawan karte aae the achaanak wo dushman nazar aane lage
 He expected a lot from this government, but like other governments, he too got frustrated
 ganga or uske ghaaton kii vyathaa katha kya kahuun
 i do not want to tell him because you all know him
 uske dard ko dekh kar har kisi ko ronaa aata he
 At these ghats, the son of our own courtyard Nazir Banarsi wrote for the Ganges, 'the waving leaves the Ganges, what you know, what the Ganga sings, the Ganga comes to me, the Ganges comes, repeating the rumors The Ganges ' ganga dashakon se apni badahaali ke afsaane duhara rahi he
 But there is no one to listen to him
 narendra jab uski dahalij par aaye the to ganga ko hi dekh kar kaha tha kii mujhe to maa ne hi bulaayaa he
 Mother also felt that there was some son who was feeling his pain
 namaami gange yojana bani to uski ye ichha or balwati hui par ek saal guzar gaya
 During this time only the deposits of eighty ghats were removed
 baaki sab jas kaa tas he
 Due to lack of drainage of the Ganga sand due to the Kachuva Century, the ghats have become such that many ghats will be destroyed in a decade
 ye aisa sach he jisase samay rahete nahin cheta gaya to parinaam ghaatak hi honge
 Seeing this pain of mother Ganga, one line of Mahakavi Nirala remembers that 'sorrow is the story of life, what to say, what i have not said till date
 'tippaniyan It is not that Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not know about our plight
 unhen bakhubi maaloom he or iske liye yojanaon kii ghoshnaa bhi hui
 But after the Shilanyas and the announcement there are many plans waiting for the beginning
