 So two days ago farmers in Greater Noida were tuned
 pitane vaale kisaan hindu the
 They were carrying cows
 lekin gorakshakon ne usiki ek nahin suni
 In such a situation, farmers are asking when the government will save from such guardians
 upi main goraksha ke naam par gundon kaa aatank badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Raising and keeping cows is also becoming a cause of death
 inke liye insaan kii koi keemat nahin
 They can kill anyone wherever they want
 khuleam katl kar sakate hai
 Law is also seen sowing in front of them
 police in tathakthith gaurakshak aatankiyon se khauf khaati he
 The government has closed its eyes
 aligarh main ek din pehle hi avaidh pashu kaatane ke naam par in gaurakshak aatankiyon ne jamkar hangaamaa kiya
 Police was informed that illegal harvesting is being done at one place
 kuch log bhens kaat rahe hai
 When the police reached there to stop illegal harvesting, the contractor of religion from behind also reached Gaurakshak
 maamla govansh kaa tha bhi nahin, phir bhi in logon ne vahaan police ke saamne hi kanoon ko haath main le liya
 The so-called security guards snatched and beaten the accused from police custody
 bhens kii avaidh kataai kar rahe logon kii police ke saamne hi jamkar dhunaai kii
 The police looked helpless and helpless in front of these people
 is ghatana se do din pehle hi in tathakthith gaurakshakon negrator noidamein aatank machaaya
 Farmers broke their hands and feet in the name of cow protection
 sabhi peedit kisaan hindu hai
 These self-defense guards are becoming unbridled in the name of cow protection
 haalat ye he ki kisaan gaayon ke ilaaj ke liye shahar jane se kataraa rahe hai
 Aaj Tak reached out to the victims
 or goraksha kaa sach jaanane kii koshish kii
 In Greater Noida, Jabar Singh, a victim of cow protection, has broken ribs
 bhoop singh ke haath naakaam hai
 Both have been hunted by the contractors of cow protection
 gokshi rokane ke liye unki fouj aajkal kahin bhi aapako gher sakati he
 Both Jabar and Bhup Singh have been killed in Greater Noida, surrounded by the same army near Jewar
 inkaa kasoor sirf itnaa tha ki inke haathon main gaayen thi
 And it was sitting in his mind that these beef eaters are poor
 tuuti hui pasaliyon ke liye ek ko bees hajaar rupee kaa prastaav he or tuuti hui kohni vaale kisaan ko das hajaar kii rakam kaa ofai diya ja rahaa he
 So that both of them withdraw their cases
 bhoop singh kehete hai ki goraksha ke naam par ye atyaachaar he, jisaki koi sunwaayee nahin he
 Most of the Hindu farmers living in Sirsa Majipur village of Greater Noida are scared
 agar unki gaay biimaar pad jaati he to bhi wo unhen dikhaane ke liye aspataal nahin le jate
 Everything has to be done in the village itself
 gaanv ke baahar to kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 One can also die in the name of cow protection
 haalat ye he ki kisaan gaayon ko charaane ke liye bhi gaanv se baahar nahin le jate
 It is also difficult to get out of the house with cows
 tathakthith gorakshakon ko sirf gaay le jate hue log dikhne chahie
 Then they do not ask whether the cows are Hindus or Muslims
 wo gaay paalate hai yaa taskari karte hai
 The guards simply start collecting cow tax
 bhoop singh or jabar singh bhi unhen lakh samajhaate rahe ki wo goupalak kisaan hai lekin swayambhu thekedaaron ne kuch nahin suna
 Just kept beating them mercilessly and in the end they kept walking in the police station after being half dead
 police bhi unke saamne bebas dikhaai di
 Did not ask anyone anything

 'jnu's action against Kanhaiya Kumar is illegal and irrational
 dilli hoicourt ne jeenyu ko is maamle main dobaaraa kanhaiya kumaar ko sunne or puure maamle kii dobaaraa se dekhne ke aadesh die hai

 The two-day meeting of the UP Working Committee of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) concluded here on Sunday
 haalanki party ke bade netaa is baithak se dur rahe
 During the two-day brainstorm, the Working Committee passed several proposals, including agricultural and political proposals
 lekin baithak kaa mukhya agenda pradesh main upachunaav hi bana rahaa
 It has been common in the media for two days that the BJP made 'love Jihad' the main topic of discussion in its working committee meeting, but the party leaders continued to deny it
 pradesh adhyaksh lakshmikant vaajapeyi ne kaha ki kaary samiti kii baithak kaa 'lav jihad' par katai focus nahin tha, balki ve pradesh kii kharaab kanoon-vyavastha par jarur chintit dikhe
 He said that during the meeting, great concern was expressed about law and order, especially the oppression of women
 vaajapeyi ne kaha ki mahila kisi dharm yaa jati kii ho uske saath kisi bhi tarah kaa utpeedan anuchit he
 He also said that the way incidents are happening with women, it seems that it is being done in a planned manner
 pradesh kii sapa sarkaar par hamalaa karte hue hue vaajapeyi ne kaha ki is shashan main aparaadhiyon ko sarkaar kaa samarthan mila hua he
 However, its inauguration faded with the absence of party president Amit Shah on the first day of the two-day meeting held in Vrindavan
 baithak kaa udghaatan kendriya mantri calraj mishra se karana padaa
 Rajnath Singh, the chief guest of the closing ceremony, was made, but he too could not attend the program

 The party says that Amit Shah was busy in the Delhi meeting over ticket distribution, so he could not reach the inauguration while Rajnath Singh was told that he had gone on a tour of Assam
 iske alaava party ke kai pramukh chehron ne bhi is baithak se apane ko dur rakhaa
 Senior BJP leader and Union Minister Uma Bharti was in her parliamentary constituency Jhansi in UP yesterday, yet she did not attend the meeting
 party ke fire brands netaa or sultanpur ke saansad varun gandhi bhi isse dur hi rahe
 Many other prominent politicians including Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath also did not appear in the meeting
 court main e raja ke bayaan ke baad bijepi ne pradhanmantri or grahamantri pi chidambaram ke istife kii maang kii he

 During the study, all the women were asked questions about their thoughts, feelings and nature at the time of the ritual

 According to Suiter, the concern of body and weight also distracts the attention of women while having sex

 chhattisgarh ke bastar main naksaliyon ne kai ilaako main deshi or paramparaagat hathiyaar banane ke kaarkaane khol rakhe hai
 In most areas, there is a business of making Rambo arrows under the guise of manufacturing agricultural implements
 haalanki maheene bhar se suraksha balon ke dabaav or aujaaron ke kaarkaanon main police ke dabish ke chalate inke nirmaan main kami aayi hai
 Aaj Tak and India Today team reviewed the villages in Bastar where Rambo arrows are being made in a very secretive manner
 zyaadaatar ghar kaarkaane main tabdeel ho chuke hambstar ke sukama narayanpur or bijapur ke kai aise gaanv hai, jahaan gharon main chori chhipe rambo tir ban rahe hai
 Naxalites have taken the initiative to open such factories
 iske liye basti ke kuch ek gharo ke kamare ko bataur kaarkaane kii tarah istemaal kiya ja rahaa hai
 This work is going on secretly
 yahan banane vaale deshi hathiyaaron kii khabar kisi ko kaanon kaan nahin hai
 Whether it is local villagers or people of police and security forces, they are not even aware that many people in rural areas are engaged in the task of making Rambo arrows under the pressure and greed of Naxalites
 kaise gramin banate hai rambo teerankliyon ke dal main hathiyaaron or goliyon kii kami ke kaaran graminon ko in dinon rambo tir banane kaa kaam mil gaya hai
 The front part of the Rambo arrow has a granite shell-like mechanism
 is shell ko aluminium or lohe kii body se taiyaar kiya jaataa hai
 Ammo and pellets are filled in the front of the shell
 jab ye suraksha balon ke sharir se takaraata he to circuit mekensm puraa hota he or visphot ho jaataa hai
 During the explosion, the shrapnel in the front of the Rambo shell injure the body of the security forces
 javaanon ke ghayal hote hi naksaliyon un par goliyon kii bauchhaar kar dete he
 Some of the houses in the village were found to have rots of iron, bell metal and iron work
 zyaadaatar logo ne is baat se inkaar kya ki unke yahaan rambo tir banane kaa kaam bhi hota he
 But according to experts, Naxalites make Rambo arrows with these people at gunpoint
 ek din main karigar 15 se 20 rambo tir bana pate he
 The iron is softened and the appearance of Rambo arrows
 iske liye behad adhik tapamaan main lohe kii chado or pipe ko galaaya jaataa he
 Its front part is polished, so that it can be filled with gunpowder and iron pellets
 in kaarkaanon main sirf rambo tir taiyaar kiye jate hai
 Naxals do the work of filling ammo and pellets in it
 rambo tir taiyaar karne ke liye hunarmand gramin ko prati din dhai saura rupaye bataur paarishramik miltaa he
 Rambo uses arrows against the soldiers
 Earlier on March 11, 2017 in Sukma's Bheji, CRPF personnel were ambushed by Naxalites
 naksaliyon ne is hamale main AK 47, insaas raifal or deshi banduukon se golibari kii
 But it was later revealed that the Naxalites also used Rambo arrows during this period
 aamtaur par tir kaman ke jariye bhi naksaliyon ne kai mauko par suraksha balon ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 But this was the first time that the Naxalites used Rambo arrows to attack the security forces
 iske baad lagaataar hamalon main rambo tir kaa istemaal ho rahaa hai
 The CRPF has also taken up the police and central security forces have also come up to curb the use of Rambo arrows
 gaanv kasbon main sandehaaspad gharon kii talaashi lee ja rahi he, to kahin krishi aujaar banane vaale thikaanon main bhi dabish di ja rahi he
 Due to this, the work of making Rambo arrows is coming to a standstill
 bhale hi market main yelo, white gold or platinum ne dhak jam rakhi ho, lekin chaandi kii apni hi sundarataa he
 The silver jewelry that gives the classic look, where in gold and platinum
 
 
 tippaniyan But there is a problem with silver jewelery that it turns black by using or keeping it for a long time
 to agar aap bhi shaadiyon kaa mausam main apane chaandi ke sundar gahanon ko mahaj isliye yuj nahin kar par rahi hai, kyonki ve kaale pad gaye hai, to iske liye bina zyada mahanat kare ham aapako bataa rahe hai kuch upaay
 
 
 Always use dry and soft cloth to clean any silver jewelery or other items
 kabhi bhi kisi chemical yaa acid jaise padaartho kaa prayog na karen
 Never polish the silver jewelry separately, this often leads to a protective layer of silver
 chaandi bahut hi komal dhaatu he, isliye behatar hoga ki aap ise gande haathon se na chhuen yaa gloves pahanakar hi chhuen
 Salt works magically to clean silver
 chaandi ko hameshaa saaf-suthri jagah par hi rakhen or ho sake to ise butter paper yaa soft kapade main hi rakhen
 Never wrap silver in plastic
 ise kabhi bhi kisi bahut zyada garm jagah par na rakhen
 Toothpaste cleans silver very well
 apane chaandi ke saamaan par toothpaste lagaaein or use gunagune pani se dho len
 Make a paste by mixing baking soda in warm water, then wipe it with a clean cloth
 yah chaandi kii chuphi hui chamak ko doguna kar degaa
 (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) lekin chaandi ke gahanon ke saath ek samasya he ki vah lambe samay tak istemaal karne se yaa phir rakhane bhar se bhi kaale pad jaat hai
 So if you too are not using your beautiful silver jewelery during the wedding season simply because they have turned black, then we are telling you some remedies without much effort for it
 
 
 chaandi kii kisi bhi jewelri yaa anya saamaan ko saaf karne ke liye hameshaa sookhe or soft kapade kaa istemaal karen
 Never use substances like chemical or acid
 chaandi ke gahane ko kabhi bhi alag se polish na karaaen, isse kai baar chaandi kii protective layer chali jaati he
 Silver is a very soft metal, so it is better not to touch it with dirty hands or by wearing gloves
 namak chaandi ko saaf karne ke liye jaadui rup se kaam karata he
 Always keep silver in a clean place and if possible, keep it in butter paper or soft cloth
 chaandi ko kabhi bhi plastic main lapet kar na rakhen
 Never keep it in a very hot place
 toothpaste se chaandi kii bahut acchhee safai ho jaati he
 Apply toothpaste to your silverware and wash it with lukewarm water
 baking soda ko garm pani main milakar iskaa paste bana len, phir use kisi saaf kapade se pochh len
 This will double the hidden brightness of silver

 bacchon ne banaai mashin, kachra daalane par khate main aayega paisa As Prime Minister Manmohan Singh faced fresh attacks in the coal block allocation case on Wednesday, the government was seen targeting former Coal Secretary PC Parekh over comments against Singh and said that unwanted comments should be avoided
 iske saath hi sarkaar ne yah kehete hue apana bachaav karne kii koshish kii ki maamla adaalat ke vichaaradhin he
 In response to Parekh's remarks that the Prime Minister should also be seen as a 'conspirator' if there is a scam in the allocation of coal blocks, Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari said that the matter was 'undesirable and unwarranted'
 Comments should be avoided
 tiwari ne kaha ki sarkaar kendriya jaanch beuro ko pehle hi saare dastavej uplabdh kara chuki he or kisi ko agar kuch kahana he to vah sahi manch par or sahi samay par kaha janaa chahie
 The minister also attacked the BJP for targeting the Prime Minister and said that she was behaving irresponsibly

 Tiwari told reporters, 'our attention has been drawn to some reports published in the media today
 behad sammaan ke saath main kahana chaahunga ki puure maamle kii jaanch ho rahi he or ucchtam nyaayalay khud sidhe jaanch kii nigaraanee kar rahaa he
 'he said,' Therefore, in such a case which is under consideration of the court and in which investigation is going on, it is inappropriate for people to comment in this way
 ’ He was asked for feedback on former Coal Secretary PC Parekh's remarks
 sibiai ne paarekh ke khilaaf koyala ghotaale main praathmiki darj kii he
 Parekh has said that the final decision maker was the Prime Minister and should be considered a 'conspirator'

 Tiwari said that the government has made all the documents available to the investigators and hence 'needless speculation' should be avoided

 karnataka ne aage tark diya ki tribunel ne tamilnadu ko pani ke hisse ko aavantit karne main in samjhauton kii vaidhata ko manyata di he, jo galat he
 The state wants the court to allow Karnataka to release only 132 TMC feet of water to Tamil Nadu
 vahiin tamilnadu ne in tarkon kaa khandan kiya or kaha ki karnataka ne kabhi bhi do samjhauton ko lagu nahin kiya
 For this reason, every time the state has to appeal to the Supreme Court to claim its right to water
 tribunel ne galati se karnataka ko 270 tiemasi feet pani aavantit kiya tha, jise kam kar 55 tiemasi kiya janaa chahie or tamilnadu ko or adhik jal diya janaa chahie
 The Center at the same time justified its action to set up a Cauvery Management Board and a plan to implement the tribunal's decision
 centre ne court se kaha ki kai spashtikaran yachikaayen tribunel ke saamne lambit hai or isliye vah un par antim nirnay kaa intjaar kar rahaa he
 Actually the Kaveri River is about seven and a half hundred kilometers long, which flows through several cities into the Bay of Bengal in Tamil Nadu
 kaveri kaa 32,000 varg kilometre hissaa karnataka main he, to vahiin 44,000 varg kilometre tamilnadu main he
 There is a dispute between the two states about the need for water for irrigation
 saal 2007 main vivaad supreme court main pahunchaa, to us samay karnataka kaa kahana tha ki barish kam hone ke kaaran kaveri nadi kaa jalastr ghat gaya he, jiske kaaran use pani kii zyada zarurat he or vah tamilnadu ko pani nahin de saktaa
 For this reason, Tamil Nadu approached the Supreme Court
 saal 2012 main purv pradhanmantri dow manmohan singh kii adhyakshata vaale kaveri nadi praadhikaran ne karnataka sarkaar ko nirdesh diya ki vah roj tamilnadu ko 9,000 kusek pani de, lekin is faisle par puri tarah amal nahin ho paaya
 After that the Supreme Court reprimanded Karnataka
 karnataka sarkaar ne iske liye maafee maangi or pani jari karne kii peshkash kii, lekin ise lekar vahaan hinsak pradarshan shuru ho gaye
 Karnataka claims that the agreement between the two states on the sharing of the waters of the Cauvery River during the British period did not do justice to it, as it did not give its fair share of water to it in the agreement
 karnataka yah bhi kahata aayaa he ki vah nadi ke bahaav ke raste main pehle padataa he, isliye uskaa jal par puraa adhikaar banataa he

 darasal, uttar korea kii sarkari agency ne iljaam lagaaya he ki siie ne dakshin korea ke saath mil kar isi saal may main kim jong un ko maarane kii koshish kii thi
 Although this attempt failed, but the killer Kim Jong was very close to them
 isiilie is taanashaah ne ab apni sabase bharosemand bahan ko apana sipahasaalar bana diya he
 It is said that there is a bigger protector than the one who kills
 magar kim jong un ki kismat to dekhie use bachaane vaali usase umr main choti he or maarane vaala usase takat main bahut bada
 But when does someone become less effective
 or taqatvar beasar ho jaae kah nahi sakate
 Otherwise, nobody left Kim's biggest enemy, America
 khulaasa hua he ki america khufia agencisiaiene isi saal may main uttar korea ke shaasha marshall kim jong un ko maarane kii naakaam koshish kii thi
 That too is not with a bomb or a gun, but through poison in the biochemical poison
 magar ek taraf siie agar kim ko maarane kii koshish kar rahi he, to duusari taraf uski bahan kim yo jong use bachaane kii koshish main juty hui he
 This name is new, but its relationship with m is unbreakable
 bachapan se lekar ab tak kim jong un kii chaheti or ab uski rakshak ban chuki he bahan kim yo jong
 Now Kim has also entrusted her sister with great responsibility in the party
 ye jaananaa dilachasp he ki aakhirkaar kim yo jong uski sagi bahan he yaa sauteli kyonki kim jong un ke pita kim jong in kii paanch biviyaan thi
 He had a total of seven children
 to jis par kim jong un itnaa bharosa jataa rahaa he or use itani ahm jimmedaari saunp rahaa he wo he koun
 Kim's sister often accompanies him on field trips and during party promotions
 zaahir rishta koi nazadiki hi he varanaa bharosa to kim apane bhaiyon par bhi nahin karata he
 So listen to Kim Jong Un and Kim Yo Jong are both children of the same parents
 or in donon kii maa kaa naam ko yong-hui he
 Who was the third wife of father Kim Jong Il
 jinaki maut saal 2004 main ho chuki he
 The brother named Kim Jong was murdered by Marshal Kim Jong Un in Malaysia, he was the eldest son of Kim Jong In
 
 That is Kim Jong Un's eldest brother
 jiske baad kim jong in kii beti he jiskaa naam kim sul sang he
 Which is currently working in the Propaganda Department of the country
 iske baad number aata he kim jong chul kaa jo philhal workars party of korea ke leadership divizan main dipti chif kii bhoomika nibhaa rahaa he
 But no son or daughter of Kim Jong In tried to overtake his fourth number son Kim Jong In and who killed him
 apane sabhi bhai bahanon main kim jong ko sabase zyadabharosepani bahan kim yo jong par he
 That is why he has made him a member of the Politburo in the party
 jiske baad uskaa ohada apane bhai ke baad sabase bada ho gaya he
 Even before this progress, she was engaged in improving the image of her brother Kim Jong-un
 or ab to use kim jong un kaa rakshak bana diya gaya he
 That is, the CIA must go through Kim Yo Jong before killing Kim Jong Un

 One fact is that in 2009, when Brian Acton applied for a job on Facebook, he was rejected

 gujarat ke paldi ke elicebrij ilaake main lav jihad ke baad ab 'land jihad' ko lekar 24 logon ke ashiyane khatre main pad gaye hai
 Actually, the rain flat of this area was given for redevelopment
 jo ki 1970 main bana hua tha
 At that time all the people living here were Hindus
 haalanki baad main is flate main 1997 tak 22 gharon ko muslim ko bech diya gaya
 In this, 2 more Hindus sold their houses to Muslims at the time of redevelopment
 dhai saal baad ab teen manzil kii ye imaarat jab 7 manzil ban kar taiyaar he
 The Hindu and Hindu organizations living around here complained to the collector about this building
 gujarat main lagu ashaant dhara act kaa bhang bataate hue imaarat kii enosi ko radd karne ke liye kaha he
 Let us know that both Hindus and Muslims have lived face to face in this area for years
 isamen kuch flats hindu ke hai to kuch flats muslim ke hai
 Builder Naushadbhai, who redeveloped this building, says that in two and a half years, the building is ready
 hamane yaha 24 ghar main se 56 ghar banaae hai
 That is why the Hindu people here have made a point of disturbing current about the building
 haalanki ashaant dhara ke tahat hindu muslim kaa ghar nahin kharid saktaa he or muslim hindu kaa ghar nahin kharid saktaa he
 In such a situation, how did the two flats which belonged to the Hindu before the redevelopment become Muslim? use lekar ashaant dhara kaa niyam bhang hone kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 Even claiming a NOC certificate in a disturbed stream by making a wrong affidavit about it
 gauratlab he ki 1970 main taiyaar imaarat kaaphi puraani ho chuki thi
 Due to this, an order was given to evacuate the building through Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
 haalanki tab bhi yahaan rahane vaale logon ne ise khaali nahin kiya tha
 Subsequently, in 2015, this building was given for redevelopment
 builder kaa kahana he ki, aaj sabhimkan maalikko pajeshan de diya gaya he
 But no one is coming to stay here
 builder ne redeveopment keliye logon koflatt ke saath pese bhi die the
 However, all these 22 Muslims were living in flats
 lekin ab is main 56 muslim parivaar rahane aaenge
 Due to this Hinduist organizations are objecting
 isi ko lekar builder ne gujarat hoicourt main ek yachika bhi daayar kii he
 At the same time, Ahmedabad Collector Vikrant Pandey says that whether the rule of disturbed section is violated or not will be thoroughly investigated

 The magazine has written that when he was being appointed in the districts, there was a lot of disturbance in him
 jab ummidavaaron ne prashasnic sudhaar vibhaag main shikaayat kar di
 Now this process is stuck again after the complaint
 ek lipic kii pariksha ke liye das-das saal laga dete hai log
 You will be shocked to know what Dainik Bhaskar has written on 20 January
 isliye zaruri he ki ab sarkaron ke saath saath adaalaton kaa bhi daravaaza khatkhataya jaae ki naukariyon ke maamle kii sunwaayee fast trek court main he
 In the Sikar edition of Dainik Bhaskar, there have been reports that recruitment of 77,413 posts in Rajasthan is stuck in the court
 inamen se 61,800 padon par niyuktiyaan congress kaarykaal kii he or 15, 613 bhartiyon bhaajapa sarkaar ke kaarykaal kii he
 In 2013, 33,000 recruits were fired for school assistants
 magar 2018 tak inkaa kuch ata pataa nahin he
 Is this a pattern, how can the same pattern happen in every state
 33,000 padon par bhartee na nikle to uskaa rajya kii kshamta par koi asar to padataa hoga
 The age and capacity of the youth will be affected
 ganimat he ki bharat kii raajnneeti main berojgaare kaa mudda nahin chalata he
 We media leaders and politicians exaggerate a lot about the role of the youth and say that the young nation is changing
 vah apane halaat ko to badal nahin saktaa, desh kya badalegaa
 In the first three years, BA, it is enough to take a job quickly
 chah saal main bie karegaa, das saal main clerk banegaa to vah desh nahin, desh ke netaa use apane hisaab se badal rahe hai
 This series also describes how the political quality of our youth is
 hamane aapako bataaya tha ki uttarakhand main 2016 main udyaan vibhaag bhartee nikaalata he magar 2018 janvari biit jane ke baad bhi bhartee kaa bharta bana hua he
 Don't know when yuva jab apane aapako yah samaj kar mantri se milane gaye ki mantri berojgaaron se khauf kha jaaenge to mantri ne vahi kaha jo sachai he
 Though that thing is bad, but that bad thing the unemployed should think what is their place in today's politics
 mantri kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chahie ki unhone yuvaaon ko unki sahi jagah bataa di
 If the young unemployed did not have such poor political quality, no minister could have heard such a lecture
 mantri ji ne inhen kaha ki mujhe tumne vidhayak nahin banaaya he
 Listen to this video of Uttarakhand's Horticulture Minister
 anand aa jayega, 29 janvari kaa yah video he
 The comments berojgaar - sar, ham apni baat rakhana chaahate hai Minister - what to keep, let the secretary do the examinations
 tum andolan karoge to main baat nahin maanoonga
 Go tell the chief minister and remove it berojgaar - sar baat to sunen
 We want to keep our point mantri - baat kya rakhni he
 Today i am reading in the newspaper, looking at photos, printing
 karte raho virodh, karte raho
 You did not make me an MLA
 berojgaar - sar ham baarah hazaar berojgaaron kaa matter he
 Minister - leave twelve, be twenty thousand
 tum andolan karke karvaa lo
 i do not listen
 tum andolan kar lo
 The minister should be so
 mukhyamantri se bhi na dare or berojgaar yuvaaon se bhi na
 Hopefully, these ministers will have a great performance and people will be very happy with their work
 kya ye koi pattern he, har rajya main ek hi pattern kaise ho saktaa he
 If there is no recruitment for 33,000 posts, then it will have an impact on the state's capacity
 naujavaanon kii umr or kshamta par to asar padataa hoga
 Thankfully, the issue of unemployment does not figure in India's politics
 yuvaaon kii bhoomika ko lekar ham media vaale or netaa kuch zyaada hi badha chadha kar kehete hai ki yuva desh badal rahaa he
 He cannot change his situation, what will the country change
 pehle teen saal main bie ho jaae, jaldi naukari le le yahi bahut he
 BA will be done in six years, if it becomes a clerk in ten years, it is not the country, the country's leaders are changing it according to their own
 yah series yah bhi bataati he ki hamaare yuvaaon kii polytical quality kisi he
 We told you that in Uttarakhand, the Horticulture Department withdraws the recruitment in 2016, but after January 2018 has passed, the recruitment remains filled
 pataa nahin kab hogi
 When the youth went to meet the minister, realizing that the minister would be scared of the unemployed, the minister said what is the truth
 vaise wo baat to buree he lekin wo buree baat berojgaaron ko sochna chahie ki aaj kii raajnneeti main unki kya jagah he
 The minister should thank that he told the youth his rightful place
 agar yuva berojgaaron kii itani kharaab polytical quality na hoti to koi mantri unhen is tarah kaa lacture nahin suna saktaa tha
 The minister told them that you have not made me an MLA
 aap uttarakhand ke udyaan mantri kaa yah video suniye
 Anand will come, this is a video of 29 January
 tippaniyan Unemployed - Sir, we want to keep our word mantri - kya baat rakhni he, secetry ko karne do egzamin
 If you agitate, i will not listen
 jake mukhyamantri ko bol do isko hataa den Unemployed - Sir, listen to it
 ham apni baat rakhana chaahate hai Minister - What to keep aaj main akhbaar main pard rahaa hum, photo dekh rahaa hum, chap rahi he
 Keep opposing, keep doing mujhe tumne nahin banaaya vidhayak
 Unemployed - Sir we are twelve thousand unemployed mater
 mantri - baarah chodo, bees hazaar ho jaao
 Get it done by agitating
 main nahin sununga
 You make a movement
 mantri aisa hona chahie
 Do not be afraid of the Chief Minister as well as the unemployed youth
 ummid he in mantri ji kaa apana pradarshan shandaar hoga or log baag kaaphi khush honge inke kaam se
 In the first three years, BA, it is enough to take a job quickly
 chah saal main bie karegaa, das saal main clerk banegaa to vah desh nahin, desh ke netaa use apane hisaab se badal rahe hai

 If we used to explain, we do not understand, but the terrorists have explained
 lekin jab bharat sargical strike karata he tab duniya ko takat kaa ehsaas hota he or pataa chalata he ki haa ham sanyam rakhte hai
 The comments ham duniya ke niyamon kaa paalan karte hue hamaari akhandta or suraksha ke liye or hamaare jansamanya ke hit ke kathor se kathor kadam uthaane kaa samarthy rakhte hai
 The surgical strike was one such incident, if the world wanted it, it would have taken India's hair, could have put us in the dock, we would have been asked for an answer
 lekin aaplogon ne pehali baar anubhav kiya hoga ki bharat ke itane bade kadam par vishwa main kisi ne bhi ek sawaal tak nahin uthaaya
 Those who had to suffer are different
 ye isliye ki ham duniya ko samajhane main safal hue he ki aatankwaad kaa vah rup he jo hamen pareshaan kar rahaa he
 PM Modi said, today i would like to bow my head and say very humbly that till now this government has spent three years, not a single blot has been put on this government
 sarkaar chalaane ke tareeke main bhi inbild vyavasthaaon ko aisa viksit karne kaa prayaas ho rahaa he taaki eemaandaaree kii sahaj prakriya bhi ho
 Technology is playing a very big role in it
 isse paardarshita aati he
 The Prime Minister said, if we talk about gas subsidy, it also gets from poor to poor and rich to rich
 maine apil kii amir log sabsidi lenaa chhod den
 So about 125 million people gave up subsidy for the country's progress
 hamane us sabsidi kaa istemaal un garib pariwaron ke liye gas kii vyavastha karne ke liye kiya jo lakdi kaa chulhaa jalaane ko majaboor the
 Technology is playing a big role in bringing transparency and the youth is well aware of its importance
 aaj hindustan us technology par bal dete hue vyavastha banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Today, no one has to explain terrorism in the world
 ham samajhaate the to samaj nahin aata he lekin aatankwaadiyon ne samajha diya
 But when India performs surgical strikes, then the world realizes the strength and realizes that yes we are restrained
 tippaniyan We have the ability to take the most drastic measures for our integrity and safety by following the rules of the world and for the benefit of our people
 sargical strike ek aisi ghatana thi, agar duniya chaahati to bharat ke bal nonch leti, hamen katghare main khadi kar sakati thi, hamase jawaab maanga jaataa
 But you must have experienced for the first time that no one in the world has raised a question on such a big step of India
 jinako bhugatna padaa unki baat alag he
 This is because we have been able to convince the world that terrorism is the form which is bothering us
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, gas sabsidi kii baat karen to yah garib se garib or amir se amir ko bhi milti he
 i appealed to rich people to stop taking subsidies
 to desh kii tarakkee ke liye kareeb sava karod logon ne sabsidi chhod di
 We used that subsidy to provide gas for the poor families who were forced to burn the wood stove
 paardarshita laane main technology bahut bada role adaa kar rahi he or yuva achche se iskaa mahatv jaanata he

 The party brushed off the hoarding, although state BJP president Laxmikant Vajpayee said that the party leadership does not agree with any such comparison

 Such a comparison reflects the political immaturity of the individual

 Samajwadi Party leader Gopal Agarwal said that BJP leaders have tried to tease people by comparing Narendra Modi to Mahatma Gandhi

 Earlier in the day, while being taken to Bali for questioning, Chhota Rajan told reporters that Dawood was under the protection of ISI in Pakistan
 tippaniyan Pakistan has so far denied Dawood's presence, but India claims that Dawood's whereabouts are the most wanted terrorists in Karachi and Islamabad in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case
 nai dilli ne bhi bharat main aapraadhik gatividhiyon main daaud kii sanliptata ke bare main islamabad ko kai dogier die hai
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh has said that Dawood keeps changing his whereabouts but is permanently residing in Pakistan
 unhone sansad main bhi kaha tha ki sarkaar daaud ko waapas laane main koi kasar nahin chhodeygi
 He said, 'government of India is committed to bringing back Dawood
 ’ chota rajan kabhi daaud kaa kareebi vishwast tha lekin baad main donon kattar pratidwandvi ho gaye
 Rajan says that he is not afraid of Dawood

 Then i remembered that i had registered for the show
 iske baad dhire-dhire chijen hoti gayi or main sho tak pahunch gaya
 The most special time in the show was when Amitabh Bachchan himself combed my hair during the break
 yah cheez mere liye kisi sapane jaisaa hi tha
 "in conversation with NDTV, Nitin Kumar told that he has completed his engineering studies
 lekin ghar kii aarthik sthiti ke kaaran vah aage kii padhai ke liye baahar nahin ja paae

 " If the Indian team, which is on the backfoot due to a crushing defeat in two consecutive matches, has to make a comeback in the third Test cricket match against Australia starting on Friday, then its senior batsmen will have to show the best of their skills on the wacky pitch of Waka
 test cricket se 2013 main sanyas le sakate hai dhonibhartiya team or uske ballebaajon kii pratishtha daanv par lagi he or aise main vaaka kii tej pich main unke liye raah kaanton bhari hogi
 So far in the series, Indian batting has collapsed like playing cards and its veteran batsmen have struggled in the face of Australia's inexperienced but disciplined bowling attack
 perth main sirf tej gendbaaj jeet kii guarantee nahin: maaikel clarkeb jabaki team par england jaisaa haal hone kaa khatra mandara rahaa he tab bhartiya ballebaajon ko khud kii or team kii pratishtha bachaane ke liye duniya kii sabase tej pich par kuch khaas karnaa hoga
 No Indian batsman has scored a century in the series so far
 pratikul halaat main teji se tuutate hai bhartiya: bread hedinainamen sachin tendulkar bhi shaamil hai jinke 100wein antarrashtriya shatak kaa intjaar badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Tendulkar started well in all four innings so far and he was 56
 50 kii ausat se 226 ran banane main safal rahe hai lekin sheersh kram ke anya ballebaajon kaa ausat 30 se kam he
 Jubani's fight between indian-australian cricketers Tejrahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag has been able to score slightly more than 100 runs in two matches
 gautam gambhir sidney main 83 ran banane ke baavjood 100 ran tak nahin pahunche hai
 Laxman also scored 66 runs in an innings but so far he has managed to score only 71 runs in the tour
 england main bhi ballebaajon kii samuhik asafalataa ke kaaran bharat ko 0-4 se haar jhelni padi thi
 Dravid was walking there but his bat has remained silent till now
 ye kaisaa gussa: ab eshanth ne dikhaai 'ungali'bharat ne is maidan par pehla match 1977 main khelaa tha tathaa do pariyon 402 or 394 ran banaaye the
 Even in the first innings he had the edge
 in donon tiimon ke bich vaaka main aglaa match 1992 main khelaa gaya tha jisamen tab 17 varsh ke sachin tendulkar 114 ran kii laajawab pari kheli thi
 By the time the Australian media attacked Team India, Sunil Gavaskar, Mohinder Amarnath and Tendulkar scored centuries on Waka and the Indian batsmen would definitely want to take inspiration from them
 jahaan ballebaajon ko lambii paariyaan khelni hongi vahiin gendbaajon ko bhi australian ballebaajon ko dabaav se ubarne kaa mauka nahin dena hoga
 In both the first matches, the Australian team was successful in getting out of the crisis
 donon test match main australia kii shuruyaat acchhee nahin rahi
 He lost six wickets for 214 runs in Melbourne after which the tail batsmen saved him
 yahaan tak kii duusari pari main bhi uskaa score ek samay chaar wicket par 27 ran tha
 In the only innings in Sydney, he was able to score huge runs by recovering from 37 runs for three wickets
 australia ko in sabhi avasaron par uski anbhavi trimurti riki ponting, maaikel clark or mike hassi ne vaapasi dilaayi
 If Ishant Sharma and Umesh Yadav would have supported Zaheer Khan, who was performing consistently well, then the situation of the Australian batsmen would have been worse
 pich hari or jeevant dikh rahi he or isamen atirikt tej gendbaaj kii jarurat pad sakati he
 Till now, the spinners have not been able to perform very well here
 is maidan par gendbaajon ko jitne wicket mili hai unamem se 82 pratishat se adhik wicket tej gendbaajon ne liye hai
 Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin gave more than 150 runs in 44 overs on a flat wicket in Sydney but he did not get a wicket but due to his batting in the lower order, his claim is still being considered strong
 ballebaaji main bhi lagata nahin he ki rohit sharma ko viraat kohli ke sthaan par yahaan test cricket main padaarpan kaa mauka milegaa
 The young Delhi batsman has scored 43 runs in four innings so far
 senior ballebaaj lakshmana bhi aalochakon ke nishane par hone ke baavjood surakshit he
 The Australians are yet to decide whether Ryan Harris or Mitchell Starc will replace the injured James Pattinson
 australia ko patinson kii kami khalegi lekin vah coach miki arthur kii naapnsad ke baavjood yahaan chaar tej gendbaajon ke saath utar saktaa he
 Till now, spinner Nathan Lyon has played the Indians easily
 in khilaadiyon main se chuni jaaegi timhbharatahmahendra singh dhoni (captain), gautam gambhir, virendra sahvaag, rahul dravid, sachin tendulkar, vivies lakshmana, viraat kohli, ravichandran aswin, jahir khan, ishanth sharma, umesh yadav, ajinkya rahane, abhimanyu mithun, pragyan ojha, riddhimaan saaha or rohit sharma

 viraat kohli (virat Kohli) bhartiya cricket team (indian Cricket Team) ke sabase senior khilaadi hai
 Many new players are joining Team India under his captaincy
 jo captain viraat kohli ko follow karte hai
 Virat Kohli once told how nervous he was when he met Sachin Tendulkar for the first time in the dressing room
 jab bhi koi nayaa khilaadi dressing room main aata he to use bhi vaisaa hi lagata he
 Virat Kohli does a special thing to make them comfortable
 ye khulaasa unhone ek intervyuu main kiya
 He said- 'I do not try to be senior in the dressing room
 'viraat kohli ne bataaya ki jab yangsters dressing room main aate hai to unako comfortable karne ke liye kya karte hai
 So that they openly put their point in front of everyone
 viraat ne kaha- 'main senior kii tarah bihev nahin karata
 i do not even feel like that when i am given more respect
 main khud ko senior cricketer nahin maanata
 When someone comes to me and starts giving more than necessary, then i joke at the same time and try to say that there is no need to be so serious
 main unako usee vakt comfortable kar detaa hum
 i think that a person should keep his words open
 'viraat kohli ne apane bachapan kaa kissa bhi sunaaya, unhone kaha- 'main bachapan main apane bhai or unke doston ke saath rahanaa chahta tha
 My elder brother is 7 years older than me
 aise main wo or uske dost apane saath nahin rakhte the
 But i liked those people more
 jab bhi main unke saath cricket kheltaa to ballebaaji ke vakt ghar bhej dete the
 i had a lot of injustice at that time
 mere bhai ne baad main jaakar pita ke saath bijness main haath bataya
 Whenever i had a match, he would take me and bring it home after the match
 usne mere liye bahut mehnat kii he
 ' madhyapradesh kii chhindwara loksabhaa seat is baar desh kii un hiprophile loksabhaa siton main se ek he jisapar puure desh kii nazar hoti he
 This time both father and son are going to contest from Chhindwara
 darasal chhindwara loksabhaa seat se congress ne is baar kamalnath ke bete nakulanath ko pratyaashee banaaya he jabaki pita kamalnath ko isi chhindwara seat se madhyapradesh vidhansabha upachunaav kaa tikat diya gaya he
 On April 29, the fate of both father Kamal Nath and son Nakulnath will be imprisoned in evms
 44 saal ke nakulanath kii ye siyaasi pari kaa aagaaj he or vah bhi usee chhindwara se jahaan se unke pita kamalnath beete kareeb 40 saalon se saansad hai
 After getting the ticket from Chhindwara Lok Sabha parliamentary seat, Nakul Nath, 'aaj Tak', in exclusive talks, described his father Kamal Nath as his ideal
 pesh he nakulanath se 'ajtak' samvaadadaata raveesh paal singh kii baatcheet ke ansh-sawaal: 40 saalon se aapke pita chhindwara se saansad he aap apni siyaasi pari kii shuruyaat karne ja rahe hai kitni badi chunauti he aapke saamne?nakulanath: bahut badi chunauti he
 Because when i talk, i am compared to Kamal Nath ji, which is a big challenge
 kyonki unhone chhindwara kaa bahut vikaas kiya he kyonki unka 40 saalon kaa anubhav he jabaki meraa sirf 40 dinon kaa
 Question: The people of Chhindwara have been watching your father for 40 years, but how will Nakulnath as an individual connect with the people here? Nakulnath: i had no need to introduce myself
 main pichley 20 saalon se yahaan lagaataar kaam or chunaav prachaar kar rahaa hum to main chhindwara ke liye koi nayaa cheharaa nahin
 i have always received love and blessings from the people of Chhindwara and sincerely hope that this time too
 sawaal: chhindwara ke liye aapaki praathamikta kya rahegi?nakulanath: meri pehali praathamikta rahegi rojgaar kii kyonki hamaara noujvaan aaj sabase zyada pareshaan he
 Modi ji had said that he would give employment to 2 crore people every year but nothing like this happened
 modi ji ne to 4 saal pehle skill india kaa naaraa diya tha
 Skill development centers in Chhindwara have been in operation since 15 years ago
 sawaal: 2014 main baat kahi gai thi 15 lakh rupye khate main daalane kii
 In 2019, Congress is saying to put 72 thousand years into account
 to kya zarurat aan padi usee line main chalane kii?nakulanath: modi ji ne 15 lakh rupee kii baat kahi thi
 We are talking about a thousand
 aap bataaie 15 lakh sambhav he yaa 72 hajaar?sawaal: raajnneeti main aana pehle se tay tha yaa achaanak se aana hua?nakulanath: main jab vidhansabha chunaav ke baad chhindwara aayaa tha to yahaan ke congress kaaryakartaaon kii maang thi ki main yahaan se loksabhaa kaa chunaav laduun
 Then i discussed this with Kamal Nath and after that i decided to enter politics
 sawaal: aapke sabase bade idal koun hai?nakulanath: mere pitaaji
 Because in front of you, Chhindwara keeps on changing and that's why they are my idol
 sawaal: nakulanath ko chhindwara kii janata vot kyon den?nakulanath: kyonki main ek yuva hum
 Here 65 per cent of the voters are between 18 and 35 years of age, that is, they are young and my thinking meets them
 sawaal: aap ko tikat milane ke baad ek baar phir se congress par vanshavaad ke aarope lag rahe hai?nakulanath: aap maanate hai ki ham loktantr main hai? to janata ko faisla karne dijie
 i do not understand why the BJP hurts in the stomach
 janata faisla karegi janata par chhod dijie or bijepi kis munh se vanshavaad kii baat karti he? unki rajasthan kii mukhyamantri ke bete saansad hai unke grahamantri ke bete emele hai vanshavaad kaa sawaal uthaate hai?sawaal: itani garmi main khud ke liye chunaav prachaar karnaa
 How to keep yourself fit in such a situation? What do you like to eat? Nakulnath: i used to campaign for Kamal Nath till now
 isi speed se ab khud ke liye prachaar kar rahaa hum to mujhe koi khaas fark nahin dikhataa or jahaan tak khaane kii baat he to main aalu ke parathe pasand karata hum
 Question: What did your father teach you before joining politics? Nakulnath: He had given a lesson that never lie and if you make a promise then you must fulfill it
 chunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main

 He has always been openly seeking windmills
 lekin is saptaah jab unhone pavanchakkiyon se nikalne vaali aawaaj ko cancer kaa kaaran bataaya to kya dost or kya dushman sabhi is bevakoofi par hans pade
 Speaker of the House Nancy Powell on Thursday described Trump's statement as stupid
 isse pehle trump kii republican party ke seenet chak grassle bhi kuch aisi hi pratikriya de chuke hai
 During a program held in Washington to raise money for the upcoming presidential election, Trump did rampant evil of windmills
 raashtrapati ne vahaan maujuud logon se kaha, 'vah kehete hai ki (pavanchakkiyon kii) aawaaj se cancer hota he
 'however, it has no scientific basis yet
 bataa den ki taap vidyut yaa koyale se banane vaali bijli ke dhur samarthak trump apni reliyon main bhi pavanchakkiyon or pavanoorja kaa majaak banaate rahe hai
 The US is currently under political tension to build a wall on the Mexican border
 trump ne dhamkee di he ki agar mexico avaidh avrajan ko nahin roktaa he to vah america kii dakshini seemaa ko 'lambey samay' ke liye band kar sakate hai jisase kaarobaari gatividhiyaan bhi prabhavit hongi
 Trump tweeted, "if Mexico does not immediately stop all illegal immigration coming to the US through our southern border then i will close the border, or a large part of the border, next week
" "sienen ke anusaar, shuukravaar ko florida main media se baatcheet ke dauraan trump ne kaha, hamaare paas sabase kamjor, sabase laachaar kanoon hai
 We cannot catch people anywhere
 mexico ise aasaani se roak saktaa he
 Trump's remarks came after officials from the Department of Homeland Security and border officials said their resources were running low

 Govind Singh Longowal was made the new president, the adopted son of the Akali Dal president Harchand Singh Longowal in the 1980s
 haalanki 60 varshiya logonvaal ko sikhon kii is sabase taqatvar sanstha kaa adhyaksh banane se samasya khadi ho sakati he
 He has been a minister in the Akali dal-bharatiya Janata Party government from 1997 to 2002, but he has virtually no experience in operating Sikh gurdwaras
 iske alaava, esajipisi ke itihaas main aisa pehali baar hua he ki samudaay kii sarvocch sanstha akaal takht se 'tankhaiya' ghoshit kisi jatthedaar ko is sanstha kaa pramukh banaaya gaya ho
 Those who tasted defeat in Sunam (sangrur) seat in the February assembly elections were among the few leaders of the Shiromani Akali Dal, Aam Aadmi Party and Congress accused of seeking support from Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim
 Was excluded from society
 asal main akaal takht ne baqayada ek hukmanama jari kiya tha ki koi bhi sikh deraa sachcha sauda se sampark nahin rakhega, iske baavjood in netaaon ne ram rahim se sampark kiya
 Interestingly, Jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh defends the move to hold Longowal to the post, claiming that he "had apologized and has been forgiven"
 '' nae esajipisi pramukh bhi is baat par jor dete hai ki unhone ''kabhi bhi deraa sachcha sauda se sahyog nahin maanga he
 "now after this appointment, the speculation has intensified that the leadership of the Akali Dal, former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son Sukhbir Badal have a lot of interference in the SGPC - why chose Longowal
 raajnneetik vishleshak jagataar singh kaa maananaa he ki yah badal parivaar kaa sochaa-samajha kadam he taaki vidhansabha chunaav haarane ke baad bhi sikh raajnneeti par uski pakad bani rahe
 According to Shiromani Akali Dal sources, there was a meeting of the party's core committee in Badal village just after the defeat in the assembly elections, in which former Union minister and leader of Sangrur district Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa demanded that Sukhbir Badal be elected One should take responsibility for the defeat in jagataar singh kehete hai, ''longowal bhi sangrur ke hai or shaayad dhindsa ke par katarne ke liye yah sukhbir badal kaa daanv ho
 But analysts say that it was necessary for the Akali Dal leadership, which has been out of power more than to deal with political rebels, to place a 'submissive' man in the SGPC

 dilli ke buraadi main hui 11 logon kii maut ke maamle main esadm kii report aa gai he
 According to the report, the deceased family was involved in Tantra-mantra and was a victim of extreme superstition
 esadm kii report se ye khulaasa hua he
 The mystery of death in 11 pipes? Meanwhile, the superstition connection of 11 deaths is also coming to the fore in Delhi, 11 pipes coming out of the same house in which the 11 bodies were found are surprised everyone
 kisi ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki is tarah ke 11 pipe kyon niklaa hua he
 In the photo accompanying the news, you can see how 11 pipes have come out of the house
 in 11 pipon main se 7 pipe mude hue hai jabaki 4 sidhe hai
 The family was trapped in superstition, in fact, these pipes in the house of Bhatia family are being linked to death
 kyonki ghar main kul 11 pipe lage hai jo kisi istemaal ke liye nahin lagaae gaye hai
 On seeing the pipe, it is clear that the family had a superstition
 kyonki ghar main maranevaalo kii sankhya 11 he, or pipe bhi 11 lage hai
 Apart from this, 7 women and 4 men are among those who die
 jabaki ghar kii diwaar main lage 11 pipon main se 7 mude hai or 4 sidhe hai
 Give many secrets in two registers, in the house of Burari where the dead bodies of 11 people have been found, now two registers have also been reported
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki in registers main sabhi mauton kaa din, vakt or tarika tak likhaa hua tha
 According to the Crime Branch source, the family had been writing notes in the register since 2015, which have been recovered from a small temple in the house
 buraadi kii gyaarah laashon kii paheli main uljhi dilli police ab do register ke pannon main funs gai he
 These registers are found near a small temple in the house
 register ke pannon par maut kaa tarika, maut kaa din or maut kaa vakt saaf saaf likhaa he
 It is astonishing that the family has given its life exactly as it is written in the register
 chaunkaane vaali baat he ki buraadi ke parivaar ne bilkul usee andaaz main maut ko chunaa jaisaa pehle se register main darj tha
 It was written in the register as to who would hang where and exactly the same was done
 is ghatana se ilaake main hadakanpapulice sutron ke mutabik parivaar kii mukhiya narayani devi alag kamare main leti mili thim
 Son Bhuvanesh aka Bhupi and Lalit, their wives and children were hanging from the iron mesh on the roof
 narayani devi kii beti or nathin khidki se latake hue the
 Apart from Bhuvanesh and Lalit, the hands of all were firmly tied
 kya moksh ke liye maut kii raah?register main pehali entry november 2017 kii he jabaki aakhri entry 25 june kii he
 It was written in the register - May all wishes be fulfilled
 jis tarah kii baaten register ke pannon par likhi hui hai unase lag rahaa he ki yaa to ye puri kriya kisi manokamana ko puraa karne ke liye kii gai, yaa phir samuhik jaan dene ke peeche vajah moksh kii ichha he
 It is being said that something like this has been written in the register as well
 police ab register ke ek-ek panne or usamen likhi ek ek baat ko dicode karne main lagi he
 Many important questions are at the center of police investigations
 jaise register main jo kuch likhaa gaya he wo kisne likhaa, kya vaaki register main parivaar kii maut kii script likhi he, kya is maut ke peeche tantra mantra he, or kya ye police ko uljhane kaa koi tarika to nahin

 It was the passion to overturn governments that dented BJP successfully

 In Gujarat, the BJP realized for the first time that the trend of the wave against the government could change and this trend changed as far as Gorakhpur and Phulpur in Uttar Pradesh
