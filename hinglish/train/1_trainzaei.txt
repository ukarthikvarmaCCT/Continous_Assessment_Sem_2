 Mittu Chandilya, CEO of Air Asia India, explains the company's strategy, "airlines try to create an image of the passengers they take on flights
 ham use toduya chaahate hai
 However, it would require hard work
 khaskar bharat main, jahaan maujuuda airlines paisa kamaane ke liye jujh rahi hai
 According to a recent report by the Consultancy Center for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA), all airlines other than the government airline Air India are estimated to incur a total loss of $ 40 to 45 million in the july-september quarter
 report ke mutabik airlines ke haal main kiraye main chhot dene se bhi hawaii yatayaat ko badhaane main baadha ai he, jabaki mahange eendhan or kamjor rupye kii vajah se kharch ooncha bana hua he
 So how will Air Asia reverse this trend, keep costs under control and offer cheaper fares for which it is popular? Will 32-year-old former model and entrepreneur Chandilya and her team be able to do this? Some aviation analysts believe that given the complex domestic market, Air Asia India — a joint venture of Malaysia's Air Asia Group, India's Tata Group and Arun Bhatia-led Telstra Teleservices — needs to have more experienced management teams

 He says, "I want to put people on the flight who don't know how to climb the plane
" yah jokhim bhari ranneeti ho sakati he, lekin isaki mujhe koi chintaa nahin he, yah vishaal bazaar he or ham unhen saath lekar chalenge
 "so will airlines ignore corporate or business class passengers? Not entirely
 chandilya bataate hai ki air asia apane vimaanon kii 185 siton main se 20 siten is catagori ke yatriyon ke liye rakhegi jinhen atirikt kiraaya dene par zyada legroom or vimaan tak pahunchane ke liye gaadi milegi
 He says, "people in the corporate world who want to travel and want special facilities in Air Asia will get it, but our entire business model will not be according to them
 ”to kya ek machuaaraa apni machhliyon or phulon kii kheti karne vaala apane phulon ke maal sang bijness travelers ke saath hi air asia main yatra karegaa
 Chandilya says, "I am targeting people who never travel by air
 ” chandilya ke ghutane main agar chot na lagi hoti to ve tennis khilaadi hote
 Now the question arises that what is the size of the segment that Chandilya is targeting? He says, "the number of air travelers in India is only 5 to 6 crores while the total population is 1
 2 arab he
 We have a lot of opportunities and we are focusing on this
 ”saath jodgaye kaa salikajis nae segment ko air asia lakshya banane kii koshish main he use aakarshith karne ke liye marketing or distribution ke liye kuch anuthi yojana banani hogi
 Sethi, who is responsible for sales at the airlines, says that Air Asia's marketing "will create a huge uproar
" ” airlines fasebuk or twitor jaise soshal network se bhi sambhavit graahakon tak pahonchegi
 Given the complexity of the Indian market, Air Asia will also change its distribution strategy
 online travel portal ekspedia ko exclusive tareeke se bachi hui siten bechney kii ijaajat milegi
 It can ignore some established players and find entrepreneurs who rely on Air Asia
 chandilya kehete hai ki unhen ise lekar ‘koi bhram’ nahin he ki sthapit travel portal aise airlines ko badhaava denge jo pehle se hi unke top customer hai
 They say, "I will not beg them

 Its Chief Commercial Officer Keur Joshi says that his portal is working with many regional airlines like Air Ventura
 haalanki, ve isse sahamat hai ki bhartiya aviation market abhi bahut kam logon tak pahunchaa he
 Says Joshi, “air Asia has brought a new and exciting dimension to the Indian market by targeting smaller cities and towns

 “south Asia is the target Air Asia will focus on South India in the beginning
 air asia kii ranneeti kaa ahm hissaa hoga is ilaake main nae root shuru karnaa
 To publicize the places in which the tourists are interested
 chandilya kehete hai, “ham jis tarah dakshin par focus karne ja rahe hai, abhi tak bharat main kisi anya airlines ne us tarah se jor nahin diya he
 "air Asia will also take advantage of air traffic from Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia and Thailand, where its group companies are already offering cheaper airlines

 We are looking forward to bringing this large community to various destinations in India
 ”yah airlines metro or chote shaharon ke bich hub or spoke model kaa istemaal karte hue har bindu tak connactivity dene kii koshish karegi
 It plans to develop four-five hubs in India by 2014

 Cities like Hyderabad, Bangalore and Kochi are considering making the company a hub
 company ne un chote shaharon or kasbon kaa naam abhi tay nahin kiya he jahaan use seva deni he, lekin vah dakshin bharat ke kisi bhi aise airport par vichaar kar sakati he jahaan e 320 vimaan land kar saktaa ho
 The key to success for Air Asia is cheaper fares
 airlines bharat main apane shuruaati kiraye tay karne ke liye railway ke fasrt class tikat ko maanak banaaegi
 Her plan initial fare is Rs 1,000 from the rail fare
 zyada rakhane kii he
 For this, the company will have to rein in expenses
 jaankaar bataate hai ki air asia apni malaysian pareint company se kam byaaj dar par vimaan lij par le sakati he, jisane europea company airbas ko 375 vimaanon kaa order diya he
 Airlines will also have to negotiate strict negotiations and in spares contracts
 kharch ko karnaa hoga kaabuoparation laagat kam rakhane ke liye airlines ko karmchaaree kam rakhane honge
 Initially, it plans to reduce from 80 to 100 personnel per aircraft and later reduce it to 60 personnel
 isaki tulana main bharat kii anya airlines main prati vimaan 102 se 185 karmchaariyon kaa anupaat he
 Chandilya, who is associated with airlines at a lower salary than before, is doing a lot of bargaining for every contract
 chaahe vah karmchaariyon sang ho, vendors, airport yaa marketig agenciyon sang, taaki laagat kam rakhi ja sake
 He told, “in the recruitment of cabin crew, we are negotiating everything for absolutely basic level
 ham yah sunishchit kar rahe hai ki contract haivi base kii bajaae parformens aadhaarit ho
 “the airline currently has 200 employees and recruitment will be slow until it gets all the regulatory approvals
 chandilya ne kaha, “har maheene itnaa kharch hone (bina oparation) kaa matlab he ki zyada se zyada nuksaan
 "but aviation experts reject the strategy of reducing the workforce to keep costs down
" dubai sthit airline adwijuri form martin kansaltency ke founder or siio mark martin kehete hai, “maanav sansaadhan kii laagat kisi airlines kii kul laagat ke 10 se 18 fisadi se zyada nahin hoti
 Therefore, Air Asia cannot achieve much with fewer employees
 ”bharat kii sasti airlines spicejet ke saath kaam kar chuke martin ne air asia ke kiraye ko rail kiraye ke aadhaar par tay karne ke model par sawaal uthaae
 He said, “rail and air travel are designed for different purposes for Indian customers
 duniya main kahin bhi airlines rail se muqabla karne kii koshish nahin karatin
 Air Asia needs to design models according to local needs
 ”aircraft parking, nevigation or landing charge ke rup main baari kharch hone kii vajah se air asia dilli or mumbai airport se dur hi rahegi
 Airport fees at both these airports have increased more than four times in the last year
 chandilya kaa kahana he ki desh ke in do sabase vyast airport par jam kii samasya bhi hoti he jisase eendhan kaa kharch bad jaataa he
 Chandilya hopes that because of all these efforts, airlines will start making money from the third month of operation
 jaankaar ise kuch zyada hi ashaavadi hona maanate hai
 Kapil Kaul, head of South Asia at aviation consulting firm CAPA, says, “the initial 12 to 18 months will be very challenging for Air Asia
 ” kaul ne kaha ki air asia ke sansthaapakon ne shuruaati puunji 3 karod dollar dene kii patibaddhta jataai he jisase yah sanket miltaa he ki airlines main puunji kam he
 However, Chandilya seems firm
 vah is baat ko khaarij karte hai ki regulatory manjuuri hasil hone main deree kii vajah se airlines ke liye november tak ke nirdhaarit samay se sanchaalan shuru kar paanaa mushkil lag rahaa he
 He says, "these are just things to distract us
" main manjuuri hasil karne ko lekar ashanvit hum
 It will happen soon
 ”air asia jaisi nae airlines ke liye laagat or kiraaya kam rakhana aasaan hoga
 Certainly its rivals will also try to reduce the fare
 lekin chandilya ko isse koi dar nahin he
 They say, "let them do it
" yah hamaare liye behatar hoga kyonki tab ve hamaare ilaake main aakar khel khelenge, jahaan ham unhen buree tarah haraa sakate hai

 No one loves those in Bihar! Bihar Police is forcibly marrying lovebirds

 Actually, two couples had booked a room in the hotel by showing fake identity cards

 Taking a dig at the 'panchayat Aajatak' platform, the former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh and senior Congress leader, Digvijay Singh said that people are being made very stupid through jumlas
 lekin sabhi logon ko hameshaa jumale sunaakar bevakoof banaaya nahin ja saktaa
 In fact, in response to the controversial tweet against PM Modi, Digvijay Singh said that some people can be fooled for a time, some people can always be made stupid, but not all people can always be made stupid
 congress netaa ne kaha ki aaj desh menjumlasince bhi he,ajukeshnabhi he, iconmix bhi he aurdarshanabhi
 Because some people are following it
 piem modi kii degree par digvijay singh ne kaha ki is desh main ye gupt rahanaa he ki pradhanmantri kitne padhe-likhe hai
 Nobody seems to know, is married or not? If Digvijay is to be believed, he did not understand what the subject is of 'intr Political Science'
 Where is it taught? aakhir main unhone chutki lete hue kaha ki samvidhan main kahaan likhaa he ki anpadh aadmi pradhanmantri nahin ban saktaa he
 The former CM says that transparency is the ideal of Congress, hence Congress wants to implement it

 As far as the question about Rahul Gandhi's reading and writing was concerned, he himself gave proof

 Apart from this, Digvijay Singh was asked in the program that why did Mayawati call you an agenda of BJP? Digvijay Singh said that this is an eye-turn
 unhone kaha ki agar pichley kuch saalon main sangh or bhaajapa kii kisi ko sabase zyada gaali padi he to usamen meraa naam sabase upar he
 Again this type of statement only seems under pressure
 unhone mahagathbandhan ke sawaal par kaha ki modi or shah se trast log jarur saath aaenge
 In this, not only opposition parties, BJP will also have some leaders

 The President also gave his assent to these provisions within twenty four hours of the approval of the Union Cabinet
 is maamle main centre sarkaar ne tatparta dikhaai
 However, to date the question has not been answered by the government or judiciary whether the provision of capital punishment reduces crime? New provisions in Poxo threaten the safety of children? Hanging in rape cases The provision was made only after the Nirbhaya gang rape of Delhi in 2012
 iske baavjood rape ke maamalon main kami dekhne ko nahin mili
 Children are more susceptible to rape
 neshnal krime records beuro (NCRB) kii 2015 kii report ke mutabik bacchon se rape ke 95 fisadi maamalon main aaropee parichit hi nikalate hai
 In such a situation, the provision of capital punishment in the case of rape of children can threaten the safety of children
 bacchon ke saamne apane khilaaf yon aparaadhon ko darj karaane ke liye vayaskon ke muqaabale behad kam vikalp hote hai
 They have to depend on their acquaintances or family members for its investigation and investigation
 supreme court main adhivaktaa rabindra gadhiya kaa maananaa he ki agar nae kanoonon se bacchon ke khilaaf rape ke maamalon main kami ai to yah swaagat yogya kadam hoga, lekin antarrashtriya anubhav bataata he ki maut kii sajaa se aparaadhon main kami nahin ai he
 He says that the provision of capital punishment in the Poxo Act may increase the risk for children suffering from it
 aaropee apni jaan par khatra jaanakar bacchon ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 In this case, special instructions have not been issued for the safety of children, nor other necessary steps have been taken

 Prabhat Kumar Upreti says that the criminal does not behave thinking whether he will be hanged or not
 vah ek unmaadi or biimaar insaan kii tarah vyavhaar karata he
 The objective of the judicial system is to reform such a criminal, but the death penalty assumes only the possibility of reform in humans
 bacchon ko nyaay dene main kitne sakasham hai ham?poxo act ke nae praavdhaanon main bacchon se rape ke maamalon kii jald sunwaayee kii bhi baat kahi gai he
 According to NCRB, in 2016, 64 thousand 138 cases of rape by children under the Poxo Act came before the courts
 inamen se ipisi kii dhara 376 (rape ke maamalon main sajaa kii dhara) main keval 1869 ko sajaa sunai gai
 The decision came in less than 3 percent of the total reported cases of rape by children
 yani jald sunwaayee ke liye hamaare desh main nyaayik dhaancha bhi paryaapt sakasham nahin he
 The Law Commission's 1987 report says that there should be 50 judges per 10 lakh population in the country, while according to the Law Ministry, only 18 judges were available for every 10 lakh population
 adhivaktaa rabindra gadhiya kehete hai ki maujuuda court main se hi kisi ko fast trek court banaakar court kii kami to puri kar lee jaaegi, lekin jajon kii niyukti bada sawaal he
 Without this, case pending will remain
 iske saath hi vah kehete hai ki bacchon se rape jaise samvedansheel maamalon ke liye court ke gathan se zyada ahm he jaanch ke str par sudhaar karnaa
 Death penalty: Punishment or revenge? The source of capital punishment in India is the IPC of 1860
 dow
 Prabhat Upreti states that while writing this code Macaulay stated that he did not think there would be any benefit from the death penalty, although the drafting committee continued to make this provision
 upreti ke mutabik maut kii sajaa hamaare samaaj main sarvamaanya sajaa he or aisi maang karne waalon ke dimag main sajaa dene or badla lene kaa antar spasht nahin hota
 That is why the demands of raping the accused, cutting the penis or hanging them often arise
 aapako bataa den ki nirbhaya gangrape ke baad bani justise verma cameti ne bhi kaha tha ki rape ke maamalon main mrityudand kanoon sudhaar kii disha main peeche kii ore le jane vaala kadam sabit hoga
 The committee had cited the report of the Working Group on Human Rights (WGHR) that since 1980, the death penalty rate in India has decreased
 iske baavjood hatya jaise gambhir aparaadhon main bhi kami dekhi gai he
 That is, there is no relation between serious crimes and hanging
 cameti rape ke gambhir maamalon main adhiktam sajaa umrakaid rakhana chaahati thi
 The committee's comment was that it is only a myth that capital punishment works to prevent cases of serious crime
 pen churaane par bacchon ko di gai maut kii sajadow
 Says Upreti, 'A peep into history shows that the death sentence was also given to the heroes of the time and these include Socrates, Jesus Christ, Robespierre to Bhagat Singh and in other contexts Gandhi's name can also be added
 is
 england main ek samay main pen churaane par bhi bacchon ko maut kii sajaa di gai or tab bhi ise sahi tehraane vaale log maujuud the
 The death penalty was actually a product of tribal society
 baad main raaj vyavastha dharmon se sanchalit hui or nyaay vyavastha naitikta se
 The greatest punishment of most religions is the death penalty
 isliye tab kuritiyon or andhvishwaas ke khilaaf bolne waalon ko bhi naitikta ke aadhaar par maut kii sajaa di gai
 The state authorities also continued this after religion
 france, rus or america kii krantiyon main to yah sajaa apane virodhiyon ko khatm karne kaa saadhan bani
 'when the mistake of execution after hanging, questions have been raised all over the world, not only in our country, but in capital punishment
 dow
 Upreti states that Italian legalist Cesar Bacaria wrote in his paper 'on such Crime and Punishment' in 1764 that it is necessary to abolish capital punishment in order to build a civilized society
 unhone sawaal kiya tha ki yah kisi morrkhtaa he ki insaan kii jaan bachaane ke liye banaae gaye kanoon hi uski jaan le rahe hai
 Whereas in a sovereign state, the state does not have the right to kill a citizen
 upreti kehete hai ki maut kii sajaa dene main agar galati ho gai to use sudhara nahin ja saktaa jaisaa ki 2009 main santosh kumaar bariyaar banaam state of maharashtra cese main hua
 Justices Sinha and Firaq Joseph had given 13 death sentences in misrepresentation and two of them were also hanged
 aise main unka jivan waapas nahin laayaa ja saktaa
 What do the hanging statistics say in India? The National Law University Delhi (NLUD) in its 'death Penalty India Report 2016' has told that the Supreme Court of America also sentenced to death in cases of rape and child rape (non-murder) Has opposed is report main NLUD ne bharat main maut kii sajaa paae 385 kaidiyon se baat kii, jisamen se 373 kaidi aarthik or saamaajik taur par pichhadi prishthbhumi se the
 According to this study, 23 percent of those sentenced to death never saw the face of schools, 9
 6 fisadi logon ne primary shiksha puri nahin kii thi or 61
 6 percent of the people did not get secondary school education
 iske alaava 76 fisadi dharmik alpsankhyak or pichde virgon se the or 74 fisadi aarthik rup se dayaneey sthiti main the
 Then how will the child rape stop? The death penalty also fails to stop the crimes considered disgusting, so what way do we have to stop cases like rape from children? In response, Ravindra Gadhia says, 'first of all, governments should stop messing with public sentiments
 logon ko lagata he ki maut kii sajaa se rape ke maamalon main kami aa jaaegi to sarkaar fori taur par janata ko santusht karne ke liye aisi maangon ko maan leti he, jabaki use eemaandaaree ke saath duniya bhar ke udhaaharan or aankade dekar bataanaa chahie ki faansee se aparaadhon main kami nahin aati
 'he further says that in such cases, what action should be taken as soon as information is received, it is not clear yet, then thinking about other things is far-fetched
 unke mutabiq aise maamalon se nipatane ke liye har thane main special wing ho jo paanch minute main puure ilaake kii chaanbin kar sake or kotahi baratane par thanedaar ko jimmedaar mana jaae
 Such offenses will be prevented with no tolerance policy and prevention
 vah kehete hai ki sarkaar mehnat or paise kharch karne se bachanaa chaahati he
 To prevent such crimes, along with judicial and police reforms, it is also necessary to make the society aware
 yah ek lambii prakriya hogi
 In such cases, immediate action, transparent investigation, better health facilities and rehab centers should be made for the victims, which has led all the government to face up to date

 Daljeet, who retired last month from the post of BCCI chief curator after serving for 22 years in Indian cricket, told PTI, 'dew will be the main concern
 isamen koi andeh nahin
 They have to understand that you cannot avoid it
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘isse bachaav ke liye outfield main ghaas kam rakhni hogi or pich par aam ghaas se adhik lambii ghaas rakhni padegi
 The more grass in the outfield, the greater the dew problem
 ’is match ke dopaher baad ek bajkar 30 minute se shuru hone kii sambhaavna he or khel raat aath bajkar 30 minute tak chal saktaa he
 Daljit believes that to keep the glow of the pink ball longer, more grass will have to be placed on the pitch

 aapako yaad hoga jab adelaide main (2017 main) pehla de-nite test match khelaa gaya tha to unhone pich par 11 mimi ghaas rakhi thi
 You have to prepare so much grass
 aap match ke ek din pehle ise nahin kaat sakate yaa phir pich dhimi khelegi
 'daljit said,' (during the Duleep Trophy matches) dew was an issue, the ball was really dirty
 pich par saat mimi ghaas thi jabaki amuman ghaas 2
 Are 5 to 4 mm long
 ghaas lambii hone kaa matlab he ki gend bahut adhik seem karegi
 'another curator, on condition of confidentiality, advised not to pour water on the grass of the outfield from two to three days before the match
 unhone kaha, ‘os masalaa hoga lekin tab bahut adhik thand nahin rahegi

 Two days before the match, water will have to be stopped as it will create moisture
 ’unhone kaha, ‘outfield main ham amuman saat se aath mimi ghaas rakhte hai lekin de-nite test match ke liye yah chah mimi rakhi ja sakati he
 With this you can reduce the effect of dew, but you cannot completely deal with the natural conditions

 On the issue of alliances with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), a new concern has arisen in front of the divided Delhi Congress
 congress ke varisht muslim netaaon ne naaraazgi ke saath hi ashanka jataai ki loksabhaa chunaavon main kisi musalmaan netaa ko tikat nahin milegaa
 In a letter to Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday, five former mlas have demanded the removal of any Muslim leader from Chandni Chowk or North East Delhi Lok Sabha seats
 inamen teen netaa paanch baar dilli ke vidhayak rah chuke hai
 The displeasure of the Muslim leaders of the party's Delhi unit has come to light just a few days before the announcement of the names of the candidates on all the seven seats in Delhi
 is patr par matin ahamed, shoeb ikbaal, hasan ahamed or asif mohammad khan ke hastakshar hai or ummidavaar ke naam ke liye dilli congress ke kaaryakari adhyaksh haaron yusuf ke naam kaa bhi zikr he
 Among them, Aaron Yusuf, Matin Ahmed and Shoaib Iqbal have been mlas five times
 hasan ahamed or asif mohammad khan do baar dilli vidhansabha main pratinidhitiv kar chuke hai
 The leaders wrote in the letter, given the number of Muslim votes, the track record of winning five Muslim leaders and their contribution, one of them should be given a ticket from Chandni Chowk or North East Delhi Parliamentary constituency
 rahul gandhi ko likhe patr main kaha gaya he ki paanchon netaa musalamaanon or anya samudaayon main bahut lokapriy hai or bahut sakriy hai
 Muslim leaders expressed apprehension that there is a lot of resentment among the people that no Muslim is being given a ticket from Delhi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 chaar netaaon ne is mudde par virodh jataane ke liye dilli congress adhyaksh shila dikshit se mulaakaat kii thi
 Mateen Ahmed said after the meeting, Sheila Dixit said that tickets have not been announced in Delhi yet and promised to consider our demand

 According to sources, the names of the seven Congress candidates in Delhi can be announced on Monday
 dilli main namakan 16 april se bhare jaaenge
 All the seven seats of Delhi will be voted on May 12
 sutron ne daawa kiya ki chandani chowk seat ke liye purv kendriya mantri kapil sibbal or uttar purv dilli seat ke liye purv saansad jepi agarwal ke naam tay kar liye gaye hai
 Yusuf said he had faith in the party and would accept the party's decision on the selection of candidates in Delhi

 - Has the manmohan-chidambaram pair failed? - Has this pair divided the economy of the country? - Has this pair ruined the stock market? - Has the rupee ruined the pair against the dollar? Such questions After two decades, once again emerged in the same open market game which was started by the manmohan-chidambaram duo in 1991 and after two decades, both failed to handle their own economy
 Areas are
 yah koi sanyog nahin he ki aazaadee ke baad se dollar ke mukaable rupaya tabhi gira jab manmohan singh desh ke vitt mantri the yaa phir aaj kii taarikh main pradhanmantri hai
 When Manmohan Singh became finance minister in 1991, there was a dollar equivalent of 24 rupees and in 1996 when Manmohan Singh left the chair, the rupee had crossed Rs 35 against the dollar
 or 2004 main jab manmohan singh pradhanmantri bane to rupaya ek dollars ke mukaable 44 rupee tha or 2013 main yah 62 rupee pahunch chukaa he
 Common man trapped in the stock market game Manmohan Singh made the stock of economy in the same period and the common man got trapped in the game of stock market and lost everything empty handed
 gaur karne vaali baat to ye he ki pehali baar manmohan singh ke vitt mantri rahete huye hi sicurti scam (ise share ghotaale ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he) hua or pehali kursi chidabaram kii hi gai thi jinpar phayrogrowth company ke peeche khadey hokar share bazaar ko prabhavit karne kaa aarope laga tha
 But the special thing is that at that time, Manmohan Singh had advocated Chidambaram as Finance Minister and within seven months Chidambaram had returned
 or aaj jab 700 point se zyada share bazaar gira to vitt mantri chidabaram ne bharat kii arthvyastha ko pukhta banaaya lekin share bazaar visheshgy ek baar phir scam hi dekh rahe hai
 If we take note, Manmohan Singh considered the profit mechanism of which the economy of developed economy is going down for the first time because foreign investment was relied upon to strengthen the rupee from the stock market
 or maujuuda vakt main videshi nivesh hi nahin aa rahaa he kyonki munafa dene kii sthiti main naa to share bazaar he or naa hi share bazaar par tike karporate yaa industry
 And the first mantra of foreign investment is to earn profits immediately
 jab antarrashtriya media ne kii manmohan kii aalochanasal bhar pehle hi usee duniya kii media ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko asafal qaraar diya tha jis duniya main manmohan jane maane arthshaastri ke taur par jane jate rahe
 When Time called underachievers, The Independent weakened and the Washington Post linked the term tragedy to Manmohan Singh
 or to or antarrashtriya credit sanstha fich or standard pors ne manmohan singh kii iconomic policy ko nakaaratmak, sthir qaraar dete huye credit reating main katautee tak kii
 The question is, where did economist Manmohan Singh miss out, who could not adapt India's favorable economy under the political system
 milti rahi corporate sector ko chhot dar chhunsal main missmanagement kaa bada aadhaar agar videshi nivesh ko hi vikaas kaa mantra maananaa he to sarkaar kaa corporate or bahurashtriya companiyon ke aage natmastak hona bhi he
 How Manmohan's economy widened the economic gap within the country and how the corporate sector discounted the discount rate compared to the common man can also be understood from the figures which are true of UPA-2
 2009 se 2012 ke bich corporate sector ko custom main 6,21,890 karod kii sabsidi di to exise main 4,23,294 karod kii chhot di
 And exempted tax from Rs 1,98,789 crore
 yani aam logon ko milane vaali sabsidi par sawaal uthaane vaale iconomiston ne kabhi corporate yaa industry ko di jane vaali sabsidi yaa chhot ko lekar koi sawaal nahin uthaaya
 The extent to which this exemption has been given can also be understood from the exemption given in the Custom Duty and Excise taken from the industry in 2012-13
 alam yah he ki pichley baras sarkaar ne custom se kamai kii 1,46,000 karod kii or chhot di 2,76,093 karod kii
 Similarly, industry was exempted from excise at Rs 2,12,177 crore and earned only Rs 1,53,000 crore
 yani sarkaar ko jahaan se kamai honi chaiye or us kamai se jis infrastracchar ko sarkaar ko sudhaarna chaiye tha use hi arthshaastri manmohan singh ne khaarij kar diya
 That is, the truth of the Manmohan Singh government, which raised the slogan of Bharat Nirman, is that 35,123 crores have been spent in the last five years only on the promotion of Bharat Nirman
 jabaki isi daur main sarkaar shiksha se lekar swasthy ke infrestracchar puraa naa kar paane ke liye paisa naa hona kaa ronaa roti rahi

 There is a difference of 22 years between Dileep and Saira, but the pair of these two tied in marriage in 1966 are considered to be Bollywood's successful couple
 syra ne ek anaupchaarik baatcheet main kaha, mujhe shaadi ke baad kam filmein karne kaa koi dukh nahin he, jo kuch bhi ho, lekin dilip sahab kaa saath hona sabase mahatvapurn baat thi

 Today is the third and final day of Sahitya Aaj Tak, 'sahitya Aaj Tak 2019' started on Friday (november 1), times have been done to many Indian languages
 
 kaarykram kaa aaj teesraa or antim din he
 On the third day, on the 'sidhi Baat' stage of 'sahitya Aaj Tak', after 'premchand' session, Sahitya Academy Award winning writer Chitra Mudgal and writer Dr
 sadanand shahi ne apni raay rakhi
 The session was conducted by Aaj Tak's Executive Editor Saeed Ansari
 is charchaa ke dauraan donon hi lekhakon ne apni baaten bebaaki se rakhin
 Saeed introduced both the guests before starting the discussion
 iske baad said ne kaha charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue kaha ki premchand ke baad sahitya kii duniya ko tab se lekar aaj tak aap kaise dekhte hai
 Premchand is not yet, Premchand is also Hachitra Mudgal said, "I think his influence on literature was 30-40 years after Premchand
" mujhe lagata he ki bengal ke navajagaran kaa prabhaav keval bhaaratendu par nahin hua tha
 Premchand tried to convert creativity into an activism
 apni rachanaaon main unhone bhartiya samaaj main dabi rudhiyon, paakhand jaisi tamaam vishyon ko chunaa
 He put all these subjects in front of the people through creativity
 logon main ye baaten utar gayi or unhen laga ki ye to hamaari baat he
 His life was very short after Godan
 lekin ham pate hai ki 40 varshon tak premchand hindi sahitya ko disha dete rahe
 Along with this, he also gave an example of three stories of Premchand and told that the stories of Premchand still give us a message
 ant main unhone kaha ki premchand nahin hai phir bhi premchand hai

 premchand samgr bharat ke lekhak handow
 Sadanand Shahi stated his opinion that Premchand is a writer of totality
 samgr bhartiya jivan ke lekhak hai
 Premchand changes the novel's definition of Hindi, changes the definition of the story
 hamane hameshaa padhaa he ki bharat ek krishi pradhan desh he lekin isaki mukkamal jaankaree premchand ke sahitya se milti he ki bharat ek krishi pradhan desh he
 Premchand introduced the novel as a peasant epic rather than a middle class epic
 stri samasya ko pichley teen dashakon se baat ho rahi he
 But Premchand's first novel Aaya Seva Sadan, in 1918, has also completed 100 years of that novel with Itifafaq, that first novel is associated with the female problem
 premchand ne bakhubi vah baat dikhaai ki jo hamaare samaaj kaa pichhadaapan he or samaaj main stri ke prati jo bhav he vah bhi dikhaaya
 Premchand places the finger where improvement is needed
 isliye mujhe lagata he ki premchand samgr bharat ke lekhak hai
 Chitra Ji gave a very beautiful interpretation of the story of the child nai peedi ke adhairya se asantusht hum: chitra mudgalsaid ne aage ek sawaal or poocha ki aaj kaa jo sahityakar he uski drushti main bazaar zyada rahata he, samaaj ko sudhaarney kii lalak khatm ho gai he yaa samaaj ko badalane kii dhun abhi bhi dekhati hai
 Chitra Mudgal replied, "I think the market is under pressure on the writer's mind, and if the pressure is there then it is good
" aaj badali paristhitiyon main jo nae sankraman punap rahe hai upbhogetavaad kii to main yahaan dekh rahi hum ki nae lekhak ke saamne sankraman badale hue hai
 The exception that was yesterday is today a door-to-door story
 hamaare nae lekhak sajag hai, main ladakiyon ko isamen aage paati hum
 Today writing is struggling
 nai peedi se main bahut santusht hum
 They are making their way
 lekin main unke adhairya se asantusht hum

 Premchand still educates us today: Dr
 sadanand shahidow
 Sadanand Shahi further said about this, the subject of language must be considered
 bhashaa ke sandarbh ko dekhen to us daur main hindi abhi ban rahi thi or use panditaau hindi main badalane kii koshish kii ja rahi thi us daur main premchand hindustan kii hindi, ek milijuli hindi lekar saamne aae
 Premchand still continues to educate us in terms of language
 unhone aage kaha bhashaa ke bare main bahut saare bhram hai
 The Hindi being spoken on the medium of communication is not Hindi in our nature
 vaakya rachana main jo angreji kaa asar padaa vahaan hindi bhrasht he
 It is wrong to say that Hindi is getting rich by connecting with the district language
 aaj agar bhashaa ko durust karnaa he to ek baar phir premchand kii bhashaa ko padhaa janaa chahie
 The program began on Friday with the inaugural address by Saraswati Vandana of Suryakant Tripathi Nirala and Kali Puri, vice-chairperson of India Today Group

 yahaan maujuud logon ko kambal die gaye
 Strict orders were given by Yogi
 Those present in the Rains shelter complained of mattresses

 bihar ke mukhyamantri ke mutabik sharabbandi ke sivaae koi vikalp nahin he
 According to the order of the Supreme Court, despite the order of ban on liquor shops within five hundred meters of the highway, only the state governments are helping to find its way out
 nitish kumaar kaa kahana he ki sharabbandi ke alaava koi rasta nahin he
 Until full prohibition is imposed in the states, then some way remains
 nitish kaa maananaa he ki bihar main sharabbandi kaa asar kai rajyon par padaa he
 Some states are trying to open shops less, while some are preparing to sell liquor from government shops
 supreme court kaa faisla aayaa ki hive par sharaab band kiya jaae, lekin log dukaan ko andar le ja rahe hai
 There is no way, it would be right to stop completely
 nitish kumaarane kaha ki sharabbandi se rajya ke rajasav ko bhi koi nuksaan nahin hota he
 Bihar's revenue was as much in 15-16 as it is in 16-17
 is dauraan rajya main sharabbandi to hui hi notebandi bhi hui
 The most impact of demonetisation was on the registry office
 iske baavjood utana hi rajasav aa janaa badi baat he
 He said that it is an illusion of the people that liquor ban resulted in loss of revenue of 5 thousand crores to Bihar but also the money of the people of Bihar who used to buy liquor of 10 thousand crores per year on liquor
 ye paisa kisi na kisi rup main tex ke rup main aata hi he
 Nitish Kumar believes that everyone should focus on this
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaarane kaha ki ham to sabhi mukhyamantriyon ko salaah dete hai ki rajya main purna sharabbandi lagu karen
 This is a social revolution, a big step, a matter of courage
 unhone kaha ki uttarapradesh main sharabbandi kii salaah wo us samay ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko diya tha or abhi uttarapradesh ke mukhyamantri ko salaah denge kii wo apane rajya main purna sharabbandi lagu karen

 It is only then that a variety of legends are prepared
 
 
 kuch sachhee, kuch juthi or kuch in donon ke bich kii
 
 
 It is difficult to say exactly when the Dawn of the Underworld became a good communicator, but in the '80s when tabloid newspapers were raging, the smugglers on the dock yard started sifting and slowly understood the criminals and the police
 Gone is what the media can make of anyone
 
 
 tab anderworld jaisaa kuch nahin tha, bas chaaku-chure chalaa karte the
 The same knives and knives were organized and became something like the underworld
 
 
 jo bana, usamen bada-sa role police kaa tha or chota-motaa role media kaa bhi
 
 
 Do not know why, the media wrote 'bhai' as brother, and made 'brother' of the whole world
 
 
 or phir uske khauf ko apane kawarej se kai guna badha diya
 
 
 Perhaps then people of the Don type had understood whether to do or not to do anything, that the people of the media must turn the phone
 
 
 or is tarah media kaa istemaal shuru hua
 
 
 The media also obeyed him, never disrespecting Dawn
 
 
 jitne bhi phone kol ab tak media or kism-kism ke don ke bich hue hai, unase pataa chalata he ki ham don yaa bhai ke saath kitni izzat se pesh aate hai
 
 
 
 
 
 or phir ek daur vah aa gaya, jab media massenger kii tarah kaam karne laga
 
 
 Sahiba, a tabloid reporter, relayed the details of the conversation with the police to the 'brothers' sitting abroad
 
 
 jab apradhi videsh bhaag gaye to phir videsh main bhi partiyaan hone lageen
 
 
 Their details were printed with chatter and many times sugar syrup was also available
 
 
 to yah vah doosraa charan tha dantakthaon, media or anderworld ke rishton kaa
 
 
 In this second phase, some part of the media was also divided, like the underworld divided
 
 
 kuch logon ko sirf daaud and company ke phone aate or kuch ko chota rajan ke
 
 
 Prior to this camp, both Dawood and Chhota Rajan had specialized in professional PR work like sending press releases to newspapers
 
 
 ek vah daur bhi aayaa, jab daaud or chota rajan jaise log press ke khaas hisse ko yah bhi bataane lage ki kaise khabar chhapni he
 
 
 The comments jab tivi kaa shuruaati daur aayaa to bad-chadhakar intervyuu bhi milane lage
 
 
 Due to lack of time, when TV people started truncating interviews of brother type people, they started to shock the reporters
 
 
 unki shikaayat kam time milane se thi, or is tarah se dantakthaon vaale apradhi global ho gaye
 
 
 It is not that everything is done by one section of the media, but there is no doubt that the waves which the legends were riding on, they bridged the gap between true, false and

 There was nothing like the underworld then, just the knife
 vahi chaaku-chure or katte chalaane vaale sangathit hote chale gaye to anderworld jaisaa kuch ban gaya
 
 
 In what was made, the big role was of the police and the small role was also of the media
 
 
 maaloom nahin kyon, media ne 'bhai' ko bhai hi likhaa, or puri duniya kaa 'bhai' bana daalaa
 
 
 And then increased his awe several times from his coverage
 
 
 shaayad tabhi don tip ke logon ko samaj aa gaya tha ki kuch karo yaa na karo, media waalon ko phone zarur ghumaao
 
 
 And thus began the use of media
 
 
 media ne bhi unka hukum puraa bajaayaa, don ke saath brudabi kabhi nahin kii
 
 
 All the phone calls that have been made between the media and the don so far, show how much respect we have with the don or brother
 
 
 
 
 
 And then there was a period when the media started acting like a messenger
 
 
 ek tabloid kii reporter sahiba, police se hone vaali baatcheet kaa byoraa videsh main baithe 'bhai' logon ko riley karti thim
 
 
 When the criminals fled abroad, then parties started happening abroad too
 
 
 inke byore chatkhaare ke saath chaape jate or kai baar shirkat karne kii chaashni bhi milti
 
 
 So this was the second phase of the relationship between fables, media and the underworld
 
 
 is duusare daur main media kaa kuch hissaa bhi vaise hi bant gaya, jaise anderworld banta
 
 
 Some people only get calls from Dawood & Company and some from Chhota Rajan

 In the available video, besides the policeman, a woman is also seen slapping the girl

 Gandhi was a devout, Sanatani Hindu
 gandhi ke jivan, dharm, raajnneeti, chintan main, swatantraaa sangharsh main yaa kah len kahin bhi, unka har kshan dharm se prachhann tha
 Was inspired by it
 unke paas dharmavihin yaa dharm se pare kuch bhi nahin tha
 This religion of Gandhi was undeniably Hindu in his personal life and was completely tolerant and humble towards other religions
 is dharm kaa 'ishwar', isaki 'aadhyatmikta', 'aatma' or 'naitikta' unki apni gadhi hui yaa chuni gai paribhaashaon se tay hoti thi
 His personal life style and conduct was defined by him
 gandhi ke jivan ke aarambhik sanskaar jain dharm ke paanch sutron ahimsa, astey, satya, aparigrah or brahmacharya se bane the
 Gandhi was always trying to bring them down in his life, his actions and philosophy
 gandhi ke dharmik hindu kaa swaroop itnaa spasht tha ki desh main sab bina kisi shankaa ke unhen 'hindu' maanate the
 The Muslim League and Jinnah always considered him to be just a Hindu
 samyavaadee unhen hameshaa sampradayik hindu maanate rahe
 Ambedkar considered him a bad upper caste Hindu
 gandhi ne jab 1920 main apni pehali badi rajnatik ladaai shuru kii, tab tak ve desh ke paaramparik or kattar hinduon ke liye bhi, rashtriyata, swatantraaa sangharsh or angrejon ke shashan se mukti kii aakanksha ke saath-saath, unki hindu aasthaa ke rakshak or hindu dharm ke punaruddhar kaa pratik bhi ban chuke the
 Neerad c
 choudhary ne apni aatmakatha main ek rochak prasang kaa ullekh kiya he
 One day in early 1921, he went for a bath in a pond in Kishoreganj (bengal)
 "nahaane waalon kii bheed main ek brahman bhi tha jo mantra / 'lok budbuda rahaa tha, apana janeu dho rahaa tha
 While bathing near him, some people were talking about Gandhi's movement
 main bhi unamem shaamil ho gaya
 Suddenly a withered, old creature looked at me with his glowing eyes and in a voice that was steeped in his piety, consternation and bliss, said that he (gandhi) has come to restore Hinduism
 "gandhi ne khud bhi, 12 aktubar, 1921 ke yang india main ghoshnaa kii thiah ''main apane ko sanatani hindu kahata hum kyonki1
 i believe in Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas and all Hindu scriptures and that is why i believe in avatars and rebirths as well
 2
 i believe in varnasrama dharma
 ise main un arthon main maanata hum jo puri tarah veda sammat hai lekin uske vartmaan prachlit or bhonde rup ko nahin maanata
 3
 main prachlit arthon se kahin adhik vyapak arth main gaay kii raksha main vishwaas karata hum
 4
 murtipuja main meraa vishwaas nahin he
 Despite all this, Gandhi's Hinduism or his Hindutva was completely different from the Hindutva of the then major Hindu organizations of the country, the 'hindu Mahasabha' and the 'rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh'
 in hindu sanghathanon kaa pramukh yaa ki antim lakshya, 'hindu bharat' kii sthapana tha
 Gandhi's ideas, deeds and objectives never had 'hindu India'
 gandhi kii prarthana sabhaaon main kuran kaa paath hota tha
 The Bible and the Gita were of equal importance to him
 gandhi kaa bharat hindu bharat na ho kar vah bharat tha, jisamen samast staron par samanta ke saath, desh ke samast dharmon, jivan paddatiyon, upasna paddatiyon, reeti-rivaajon kaa samavesh ho
 Hindu organizations rejected Gandhi's India
 unke paas 'hindu bharat' kii apni kuch dhundhlayi, aspasht vyakhyaayein thim
 They were never tested on the ground of practicality
 unka 'hindu bharat' kaa swapn aparyaapt yaa adhure yaa apramanik itihaas ke saath, sadaiv avastaviktaaon main vicharan karata rahaa
 In much the same way as the supporters of Pakistan and Jinnah had no clarity on the entire structure, form, future etc
 of Pakistan even till Partition
 in hindu sanghathanon kaa hindutv jis hindu dharm or hindu samskruti kii mahanata or gaurav se janm letaa tha, jisase prerana paata tha, uskaa antim saarvbhaum rajya lagbhag dedh hajaar saal pehle khatm ho chukaa tha
 Later, around the second millennium, a new, foreign and very strong religion in itself, 'islam', came into this country
 yah duniya ke bahut bade hisse main bahut teji se failaa tha
 This religion was full of many political disparities, completely deviated from its original Islamic thought and religiosity
 par rajnatik satta haath main hone ke kaaran vah yahaan apana niyantran or prabhaav badhaata gaya
 After almost five hundred years of rule by Islam, then another new, external and equally strong religion, 'christianity' entered the borders of the country
 islam ke visham or bhatke rup se bilkul alag, yah ek sugathit, viksit or aarthik rup se sampann ho rahi sabhyataa kaa dharm tha
 Developed so that the Renaissance in it began about four hundred years ago
 isamen saamaajik, audyogic, rajnatik krantiyaan ho chuki thim
 The basic thinking of education had developed
 is dharm ke samast bahari or bhitari dhaanche behad majboot the
 This religion had such a huge political power in England, which controlled half the world
 iske paas vigyaan, puunji, aadhunik hathiyaar, gyaan, nai chetana or saahas tha
 It started influencing or disintegrating the societies of both 'hindu' and 'islam', their political and economic structures in the country
 1857 i
 In India both the East India Company and the Mughal Empire ended
 us samay tak duniya main bahut-se nae vichaar, nai dharanaen, nae andolan janm le chuke the or fail rahe the
 These were different from the inertia of religion, the traditional social structure, the dominant politics
 ye manushya kii samanta, samaan adhikaron or nai saamaajik chetana or aarthik samanta ke sangharshon se prerit the
 These ideas and movements were focused on 'power of man', separate from 'power of religion'
 is samay tak dharmik raashtra ek behad pichhadi, manushya virdohi, shoshak avadharana maani ja chuki thi
 India too was not untouched or isolated from them
 majdoor andolan, dalit or damiton ke utthan ke sangharsh, aadhunik shiksha, loktantr, udyogikaran, vaigyanik avishkaar, antarrarashtriya sampark aadi tatwon ne bharat main bhi, kisi bhi tarah ke dharmik raashtra kii avadharana yaa vichaar ko puri tarah apraasangik yaa nirarthak bana diya tha
 Gandhi and his accompanying leaders understood all these truths
 ve apane desh ko jaanate, samajhate the
 Understand the basis of its texture, history, its power
 gandhi jaanate the ki desh kii vividhta hi iskaa praan he
 Unity in this diversity and taking it with you is the foundation of the freedom struggle
 is vividhta ko saath lekar chalane or bhavishya ke bharat ko bhi isamen hi gande ke alaava, aazaadee kii ladaai ladgaye or uske dwaara swatantraaa paane kaa doosraa tarika nahin he
 That is why the nature of Gandhi's dream India has never been Hindu
 ve kabhi hindu raashtra ke samarthak nahin rahe
 Their Hindutva was never aggressive or violent towards non-hindu religions
 us samay koi bhi jaraa-sa sachet, samvedansheel udaar vyakti 'hindu raashtra' ke pravaktaaon yaa iske yoddhaon kii vaicharik simaaon, or visangatiyon ko spasht dekh saktaa tha
 Advocates of Hindu India had some clear and real challenges that they avoided to encounter directly
 shaayad isliye ki ve unhen vijit nahin kar sakate the
 The first and foremost challenge before him was the thousands of years old exploitative and inhuman caste system of the country
 hindu sanghathanon ke vichaaron or bhaawanaaon kaa ubhaar puri tarah oonchi jatiyon ke bich kendrit tha
 Through this Hindu rise, after hundreds of years, once again the upper caste of India was looking for the possibility of regaining their lost or ineffectual identity, domination and glory of their past under the rule of Muslims
 dilachasp he ki inke mukaable main daliton kaa apane utthan kaa sangharsh bhi sakriy ho chukaa tha
 The battle for their identity and social consciousness and rights had begun
 ve jaagrath or sangathit ho rahe the
 He was making a place in the politics of the country as a big power
 loktantric prakriya main dhire-dhire utarate ja rahe the
 His right to vote was giving him a place in the political system of the country as an important party, but also to a lesser extent
 phule ke baad ambedkar is savarna hindu dharm ke sabase kattar or ugr virdohi the
 The sole goal of his personal and total political life was to end this exploitative and oppressive caste system created by Hindus of high varnas
 jaahir tha, hindu bharat ke pravaktaaon yaa savarnon ke saamne pehali sabase badi chunauti jati vyavastha main saikadon saalon se kuchle ja rahe dalit the
 They were not accepting them
 1935 main jab ambedkar ne dharmantaran kii ghoshnaa kii, to puraa savarna hindu samaaj baichaiyn ho gaya tha
 Dalits were counted along with Hindus
 unki sankhya hi hindu ko bahumat main rakhti thi
 After their separation, the Hindu lost his claim to be the majority
 us samay ambedkar ne swayan ke liye isai dharm yaa islam sweekaar karne kii sambhaavnaaon ko bhi khulaa rakh choda tha
 Apparently, the conversion of a large number of the country to Christianity or Islam in this way was a great shock to the social and political nature of any future 'hindu India'
 ambedkar ko manaane or samajhane kii koshish kii gai
 Ambedkar also had a long correspondence with Savarkar and Munje in this regard
 gandhi bhi baichaiyn the
 Watching the entire event cautiously
 'puna pact' gandhi kii isi bechaini kaa parinaam tha
 Later, in the form of Harijan movement, he prevented the Dalits from breaking away from the Hindus and the Congress
 hindu sanghathanon ke saamne duusari badi chunauti thi ki ve apni kaaryastylee or uddeshyon ke prati madhya yaa ucch madhya varg ke hinduon ke alaava, anya virgon, sampradaayon or dharmon ke logon ko aakarshith nahin kar paae
 Muslims, Christians, Dalits were different from Hindu organizations, but even after these Hindu organizations gave place and recognition to Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs under the umbrella of Hinduism, their influence on the people of these religions remained negligible
 'hindu raashtra' yaa 'hindu bharat' aisi kisi avadharana yaa isko saakaar karne ke sangharsh main unki koi dilchaspee nahin thi
 The third major challenge before Hindu organizations was the numerous, diverse and contradictory sub-religions of Hinduism, their basic concepts, interpretations, doctrines and rituals
 apane aadhaar rup main isai yaa islam dharm kii tarah hindu dharm kisi ek pustak or ek ishwar kaa dharm nahin tha
 In many of its fragmented forms, due to many sub-religions and classes, Hindus did not even have a uniform Hindu society living a kind of lifestyle
 santare kii tarah iske andar anek phanken thim
 Apart from all this, Hindu organizations were looking for a great and grand past very close to themselves
 par gupt samrajya ke rup main vah dedh hajaar varsh purv nasht ho gaya tha
 Hence, he later tried to make the vanquished heroes a heroic Hindu nationalism and the great history of Hindus
 unke paas ateet kaa vaisaa koi shashakt saarvbhaum 'model' nahin tha, jaisaa ki europiyon ke paas rome yaa greece ke rup main tha
 The Hindu nation's conception of Hindu organizations in itself was too backward, limited and devoid of any kind of modern consciousness, due to not having a developed and vibrant past
 ateet chhod bhi den, to bhi yah pariklpana bhavishya main bhi kisi saarvbhaum, ekikrut, aadhunik, pragatisheel bharat ko gande main puri tarah asamarth thi
 Anyway, no major universal Hindu king or state in the history of India had developed by merely talking about 'hindu India'
 usne kabhi apana sirf hindu swaroop bana kar nahin rakhaa tha
 Because in Hinduism 'dharma' and 'rashtra' were always seen as two separate, independent and parallel entities
 unka dharm or raashtra kaa yah vibhaajan isai yaa islamic samrajyon se alag tha
 Religion and state remained there for hundreds of years
 isse alag, bharat ke itihaas main hindu raajaaon kaa vyaktigat dharm to rahaa, par saamanytah koi aisa ghoshit rajya dharm nahin rahaa, jahaan ''rashtrayuddh' or 'dharmayuddh' ek-duusare main samahit ho jate hon
 Ashoka, Pushyamitra, Kanishka, Gupta dynasty, Vijay Nagar empire, etc
, whose personal religion and trends were clear, but it was the religion of the nation or it was a religious India, will not be announced even then
 ajanta yaa nalanda kaa vaibhav tab tha, jab 'param bhagwat' gupton ke mandiron main 'avatharavaad' kaa swarna yug tha
 In Hindu social structure and culture, the concept of nation was never declared to be associated with religion, as did Christianity and Islam, the larger kingdoms of the two major religions
 yah hindu dharm kii apni bilkul alag yaa ki vishisht tarah kii mahanata, viratata, udaartaa or sahishnutaa thi, jo vishwa ke anya dharmon main durlabh thi
 The problem was that the Hindu organizations of the country were denying this truth of both India and Hinduism
 unka saanskrithik rashtrawaad 'dharm' or 'raashtra' ko ek ganth main baandh rahaa tha
 Consequently, those who were not 'hindus' were seen as 'others'
 unki alag 'dharmanishtha' ko shatrurup diya ja rahaa tha
 This was a fatal thought for the origin of unity in India's diversity
 gandhi yah sab samaj rahe the, isliye unhone apane hindu kii paribhaasha 'hindu sanghathanon' ke 'hindu' kii paribhaasha se bilkul alag kar lee thi
 Gandhi's goal was to be the poorest, weakest last man in society, not to establish a 'hindu nation'
 is kamjor aadmi ke sukh-dukh unke sarokaar the
 The country had a shared culture
 saajha itihaas tha
 Its diversity was protected and freedom, so they never spoke of 'hindu India'
 iske vipareet, musalamaanon kaa samarthan or unki pakshadharata karke ve in sanghathanon ke sabase bade shatru bane or antat 'sanatani hindu' gandhi kii hatya, ek kattar hindu ko hi kerani pad gai
 The conditions laid down by Gandhi in January 1948 to break his fast were for and in favor of Muslims
 ’ ’ ’janvari 1948 se pehle hindu sanghathanon ko gandhi se bahut dikkat nahin thi
 Gandhi went to a meeting of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Delhi on 16 September 1947
 pyarelal or brajakrishna chandivaala ke vivaranon se pataa chalata he ki us samay tak gandhi or sangh ke bich sahaj or saamaanya sambandh the, baavjood aapasi saidhantik asahmatiyon or kaaryastylee ke virodhabhasi swaroop ke
 Let us see the relevant excerpts of what happened in the meeting and what Gandhi said: "the flag salute took place before the assembly started
" uske pashchaat 500 swayamsevakon ke mukhiya basantraav ok ne kahah'sangh kaa uddeshy aap jaise mahan vyakti ko paidaa karne vaale hindu dharm ke siddhanton ke anusaar chalakar uski raksha karnaa he
 Protecting the country, religion and culture is our only goal
 kisi tarah kii tikaa kii parvaah kiye bina ham apana kaam kiye jate hai
 "note that by this time Gandhi's Hindu image in the Sangh was unquestioned
 unako gandhi se koi shikaayat nahin thi
 Gandhi said
 
 
 ''indian union main zyada sankhya hinduon kii he
 There is no shame in this
 lekin agar ham yah kahen ki yahaan hinduon ke sivaa doosraa koi rah hi nahin saktaa or koi rahe bhi, to use hinduon kaa gulam banakar rahanaa hoga, to yah galat baat he
 Hinduism does not teach this
 mere hindu dharm main sab dharm aa jate hai
 The squeeze of all religions is found in Hinduism
 agar hindu dharm sabko hajam karne kaa kaam na karata, to yah utana ooncha na uth saktaa
 There are ups and downs in all religions
 jab se hindu dharm main asprishyata ko sthaan mila, tab se ham girane lage
 i will not tell you how much it has hurt us
 agar ham kahen ki hindustan main sivaay hinduon ke sabko gulam hokar rahanaa he, yaa pakistan vaale yah kahen ki pakistan main sivaay musalamaanon ke sabko gulam banakar rahanaa he, to yah cheez chalegi nahin
 By saying this, both leave their religion and destroy their religion
 ''
 
 
 i am told that you are friends of Muslims and enemies of Hindus and Sikhs
 musalamaanon kaa dost to main 12 baras kii umr se rahaa hum or aaj bhi hum
 But those who call me an enemy of Hindus and Sikhs do not recognize me
 meri rag-rag main hindu dharm samaaya hua he
 The way i understand religion, i am serving him and India with full force
 mere dil kii baat maine aapako suna di he
 To protect India, its path of progress is not that we should emulate the evil that happened in Pakistan
 anukaran ham sirf bhalaai kaa hi karen
 "gandhi said
 
 
 ''aapaki sankhya badi he
 If your strength is in the ruin of India, it will be a bad thing
 aap par jo iljaam lagaaya jaataa he, usamen kuch bhi sach he yaa nahin, yah main nahin jaanata
 i just told you what the result of something can be
 yah sangh kaa kaam he ki apane sahi karmon se is iljaam ko jhooth sabit kar de
 "it is probably Gandhi's direct and final dialogue with the Sangh people
 yah swayan main bahut spasht he
 In this, Gandhi's views towards Hedgewar and Golwalkar are found
 bhaashan main gandhi spasht rup se sangh kii musalmaan virdohi gatividhiyon kii ninda karte hai par sangh ke anushaasan aadi kii prashansa karte hai
 Gandhi continues to disagree with his many things
 gandhi hindu dharm kii apni vyakchaya ke aadhaar par unhen spasht vinamr or apane khaas tareeke se, bilkul saaf shabdon main samajhaate hai ki 'hindu dharm' anumati nahin detaa ki bharat main gaiyr hindu ko hindu kaa gulam banakar rahanaa padegaa
 It is interesting to see that in his life, Gandhi not only prevented the increase of influence of Hindu organizations, but prevented his death more than that
 godse dwaara kii gai gandhi kii hatya ne, bharat ke 'hindu bharat' banane kii kisi sambhaavna ko tatkaal puri tarah khatm kar diya
 This happened in three ways
 pehla yah ki janamanas hindu sanghathanon ke viruddh ho gaya
 Their nationalism, their cultural pride, their aim of Hindu Rashtra which was their basis, came to the center as a violent organization
 swayan hindu sanghathanon ke bhi lagbhag 80 fisadi log is tarah gandhi kii hatya kiye jane ke viruddh the
 Secondly, the feeling within Sardar Patel himself that there was little sympathy for the discipline, nationalist tone and loyalty of this organization, and whose members he considered 'disciplined, but' wandering patriots', ceased
 gandhi kii hatya ke baad unhone inkaa kathor daman kiya
 Union banned
 golwalkar ko jail main band kar diya gaya
 Barring Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, the entire executive of the Hindu Mahasabha was arrested
 iske baad hindu mahasabha mrit praayah sanghathan hi rah gaya
 The union also went into the background
 vah saarvajanik manch par waapas je
 P
 andolan ke samay hi lautaa jab usne chaatr andolan kaa samarthan kiya
 Later opposed to the emergency
 is virodh ne uski rashtravaadi chhavi ko phir ek baar majboot kiya
 Only after this protest, he was able to break free from the negative image that had become for him in the mind of a common citizen after the assassination of Gandhi
 teesraa yah ki congress ke andar jo dakshinpanthi gut tha or jo hindu sanghathanon ke saath shuru se hi sahanubhuti or saamanjasy rakhata tha, uskaa swar congress ke andar bilkul dab gaya yaa kamjor ho gaya
 Overall, by his assassination, Gandhi's chances of involuntarily leaning towards any kind of Hinduist form of the country have been for a very long time or almost completely eliminated
 dharmik raashtra ek anivaary buraai he
 We should not forget that Pakistan had become a religious nation
 uske banane kaa aadhaar sirf 'dharm' tha
 After being born as an 'islamic country', we are seeing its result today
 swatantraaa ke baad bharat ne dharmik raashtra kaa rasta nahin chunaa
 It grew as a democratic, modern, progressive, secular and a nation that believes in unity in diversity
 gandhi is baat kaa mahatv samajhate the, nehru samajhate the, ambedkar samajhate the, patel samajhate the, moulana aaazaad samajhate the, vampanthi or samaajawaadee samajhate the
 Liberals were considered tolerant Hindus
 isiilie bharat teji se viksit hota rahaa
 The path of religious nations always ends in a blind cave
 is sachai ko dekhnaa, parakhnaa bahut aasaan he
 No religious nation of the world has contributed in the interest of humanity, in development, in science
 dukh or chintaa kii baat he ki hamaare aaj ke samay ke mukhya swar phir vahi hai
 Then there are whispers of 'hindu India', a frenzy to make 'others' an enemy
 isaki vividhta ko khatm karne kii soch or koshishen hai
 Gandhi's one-and-a-half-hundredth birth anniversary gives us the opportunity to reflect on Gandhi's life, deeds and religion, and to look specifically at how his 'sanatani Hindu' saw and accepted India in its totality
 gandhi kaa 'hindutv' duusare dharmon ko daraata nahin tha
 Gandhi's 'ramrajya' was expressed as a utopia, not a violent, aggressive way to honor Rama in Ayodhya
 gandhi kaa 'hindutv' karmkaandon kaa, prachaar kaa, unmaadi bhakthi kaa nahin aadhyatmikta kaa tha
 Entering the frontiers of humanism, generosity and morality
 gandhi kaa 'hindutv' anya ko samahit karata tha na ki sankeernata main ghira hua use bahishkrut karata tha
 Gandhi's 'hindutva' was born from the same spirit of religion, which is the real origin of the birth and existence of all religions of the world
 isamen karunaa, udaartaa, sahishnutaa, prem or duusare dharmon kaa sammaan tha na ki hinsak or unmaadi bhashaa main unhen chunauti dena or unhen nasht karnaa
 Gandhi's 'hindutva' was able to connect everyone with him in the freedom struggle
 desh kii vividhta ke saath ekarup ho kar swatantraaa kii ladaai ko aage le ja sakaa tha
 Gandhi fought against racial discrimination, discrimination in South Africa
 bharat main champaran main kisaan, ahmedabad main majdoor or asahyog andolan main musalamaanon ko saath jod kar ladaai ladi
 Made his 'hindutva' more widespread, accepted, humane and effective among them all
 yadi ham aaj ke hinduvaadi sanghathanon kii hindutv kii paribhaashaayen or iske vighatnkaaree swaroop ke ghaatak parinaamon kii sambhaavnaaon yaa aahaton ke bich gandhi ke 'hindu' va 'hindutv' ko uske sahi arthon main samaj len or use sweekaar yaa angikaar karen, to gandhi kii dedh sauveen jayanti par unka samaran hamaare or desh, donon ke liye sachmuch sarthak, praancegik or laabhakaari hoga

 dilli main janalokapal bill par hangaamaa machaa he
 The first issue was why the Delhi government is not bringing the Jan Lokpal bill and now there is a ruckus that the government approved the Jan Lokpal bill by calling the cabinet in such a state of hygiene
 aarope ye lag rahe hai ki kejariwal sarkaar kii manshaa janalokapal laane kii he hi nahin, wo to sirf vidhansabha main bill pesh karne kaa dikhaava karnaa chaahati he
 The Kejriwal government is ready to introduce the Lokpal Bill in the Assembly and the Aam Aadmi Party is not tired of praising itself for it
 party kaa daawa he ki ye bill vahi hoga, jise anna ne manjuuri di thi, lekin vipaksh ne sarkaar kii manshaa ko lekar sawaal khadey kar die hai
 Congress leader Ajay Maken has said that if the government already had the bill ready, then why there was a need to call the cabinet immediately to approve it
 congress ne saadhaa nishanadilli congress ke adhyaksh maakan ne kaha, 'mere par farvari 2014 ke bill kii copy he, agar ye vahi bill he, to aath maheene se sarkaar ne isko pesh kiye jane kiprakriyaakyon puri nahin kii
 If there is a change in this then why is the government silent
 'kya vaaki asamanjas main he kejariwal sarkaar?vipaksh sarkaar par dabaav main janalokapal bill laane kaa dikhaava karne kaa aarope laga rahaa he
 The reason is also because when the Delhi assembly session started on Wednesday, the BJP had raised a question about not bringing Janlokpal inside the assembly, then there was a tremendous protest within the assembly to present the Congress Loklokpal
 isiilie ab bijepi aarope laga rahi he ki kejariwal sarkaar asal main janalokapal kanoon ko lekar hi asamanjas main he
 Leader of the Opposition said that the process wants to trap the government, Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta said, 'first you said that the Delhi Lokayukta will amend the bill, then you filled the post of Lokayukta vacant for two years from the old law itself
 ab kah rahe hai ki anna vaala bill lekar aaenge
 Actually, the government is not ready and it wants to implicate it in the legal process
 'vipaksh ne uthaae ye sawalvipaksh kaa aarope he ki sarkaar janalokapal kanoon ko lekar apane hi vaadon se peeche hat rahi he
 That is why he has not already clarified the situation regarding the bill
 agar bill taiyaar tha, to pehle se iske liye jaruri sanvaidhanik aupchaaritaayen puri kyon nahin kii
 If this is the same bill that was introduced during the 49-day tenure, then why is the government not clear about the provisions of the bill
 agar sarkaar kii manshaa vaaki bill ko paas karaane kii he, to niyam ke mutabik uparajyapal or centre ke paas manjuuri ke liye kyon nahin bheja gaya
 Because the Jan Lokpal bill is related to financial provisions
 agar isamen centre ke lokapal bill ke mutabik badlaav nahin kiye gaye, to kya ye bill centre se takaraav kaa ek or bahaanaa nahin banegaa
 We are bringing a strong Lokpal: Sarkar: The Delhi government argues that the opposition is not yet aware of the draft bill, so their opposition is just a noise
 dilli sarkaar main mantri satyendra jain ne kaha, 'abhi bill main kya he, iskaa kisi ko pataa he, jo tarah-tarah kii baaten kar rahe hai
 We are bringing a strong Jan Lokpal, and let it be introduced in the Assembly
 ' Earlier, England won the toss and came out to bat first, losing the wicket of opener Jason Rai (15) quickly, but after that the Pakistan bowlers had to struggle not only to get wickets but also to stop the run flow

 This time Ganapati spent 10 days with his devotees but not 11 days
 har saal ganpati apane janmdin yani ki ganesh chaturthi par apane bhakton ke ghar padhaarte hai or anant chaturdashi ke din inkaa visarjan hota he
 Lord Ganesha is the ruler of the water element and this is the reason why Lord Ganpati is worshiped on the day of Anant Chaturdashi and immersion of Ganapati statue
 aisi manyata he kividhipurvak visarjankarne vaale jaatakon koganesh jimanchaha vardaan dete hai
 Muhurta of immersion: 2 pm to 2:20 pm
 2: 3:30 pm to 8 pm
 Rules of immersion - First of all, worship the Lord Ganesha in the same way before immersion - Modak, of fruits
 Offer bhog-lord Ganesha's aarti-pray to depart from Lord Ganesha- Pick up the idol of Ganapati from the place of worship, place it on another wooden piece, keep fruit, flowers, clothes, modak and Dakshina together - a cloth
 Make a bundle by placing a little rice, wheat and panchmeva in it, put some coins in it - keep that bundle near the idol of Ganesha - immerse Ganesha in clean water, how to protect the environment
 Can be done at home
 iske liye bade tub main saaf pani bharen or usamen ganesh ji kaa visarjan kar den
 Let the water and idol remain in the tub for a few days, and then leave that water under a tree
 isse nadi, talab jal pradooshan nahin badhegaa
 If Ganesha idol is small in the pot then you can immerse Ganapati by placing it in the flower pot
 pratimaa par har din jal chadhayen
 Gradually, the idol of Ganesha will be absorbed into the soil

 The results of Indian hockey are also seen to fade as the cold weather approaches
 australia main mili jeet, asiad or kaamanwealth khelon main mili kamyaabi kaa asar jaataa dikh rahaa he, lekin hockey ke kuch phans hai, jinka josh thanda nahin padaa he
 All these fans have gathered from different corners of the world to watch the Champions Trophy going on at Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar and are very special
 toornament main bharat kii lagaataar do maichon main haar ke baavjood inhen bhartiya team se badi ummiden hai
 Baldev Singh Kalsi, who is about 60 years old, works as an engineer in British Airways, but he wants to make his first identity as a hockey fan
 darasal hockey unke khun main bahati he
 He has been encouraging the Indian team by going to the stadium in all the Olympic Games since the Munich Olympics held in 1972
 unke liye varsh 1975 worldcup main bharat kii jeet kii yaad ab bhi tazaa he
 He tells how he celebrated Surjeet and Ashok Kumar's goal, and has been celebrating that victory again and again
 baldev bharat kii pakistan ke khilaaf varsh 2003 champions trophy main amsterdam main mili jeet ke lamhon ko ras lekar sunaate hai
 Jugraj Singh, Gaganjit Singh, Deepak Thakur and Prabhjot's goals in that tournament are also refreshing
 baldev maujuuda team ke jambaazon se bhi badi ummid rakhte hai, khaskar sardaar singh, srijesh, dharmaveer jaise khilaadiyon kii vah tarif karte nahin thakte
 Actually, Baldev and about 10 fans like him will often be seen in Team India's blue jersey encouraging the Indian team on television
 ye phans in dinon bhubaneshwar ke kalinga stadium main bhartiya team kaa josh badhaate dekhe ja sakate hai
 Another hockey fan like Baldev, Vicky Moga has come here from Finland, and Vicky, 37, has also opened a hockey club in Finland, in which his five-year-old son Arjun also plays the match wearing the blue jersey of the Indian team
 viki ne khud bhi uniwarsity level tak hockey kheli he
 He says that without hockey, it is difficult to think of anything else

 vah bataate hai ki bharat ne holland ko 2-1 se haraakar kaansya padak jeeta tha
 Monty says that he was 13–14 years old at the time, but the memories of that match are very special for him
 bharat kii pakistan ke khilaaf varsh 2003 champions trophy main mili jeet ko bhi vah utane hi chaav se yaad karte hai
 It is not that they all have a lot of money or time, due to which they are able to watch the match
 british airways main kaam karne vaale baldev sabhi bade toornamenton se pehle dabl shift karnaa shuru kar dete hai, or kai baar to vah hafte ke aakhir main milane vaali chuttee bhi qurbaan kar dete hai, taaki hindustan ke match dekh paaen
 They all hope that Indian hockey will touch the highs again

 For the Indian team, these fans often play the role of twelfth or extra player

 Of course, they do not desire to earn a name, but they keep praying for the success of the Indian team
 is baar hockey india ne inhen bhubaneshwar main ho rahi champions trophy ke dauraan guest kaa darja diya he
 They are very happy with this little help

 -input language dilli congress ke adhyaksh ajay maakan ne dilli sarkaar par aarope lagaaya he ki CCTV project ke naam par dilli sarkaar ne ghotaalaa kiya he
 On this charge, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Dilip Pandey said that this is a recipe to popularize himself politically
 dilip pandeya ne congress par palatwaar karte hue kaha ki dilli congress or bijepi kaa ek morcha he
 Congress, BJP and Lieutenant Governor are all in Delhi
 dilip pandeya ne kaha ki ajay maakan ke saare aarope niraadhaar hai
 This is being done to harass the AAP government
 dilip pandeya ne congress se sawaal poochhate hue kaha ki 15 saal tak congress party ne dilli main kya kiya? tamaam mushkilon ke baad aam aadmi party yah kaam karne ja rahi he or congress isamen bijepi or uparajyapal ke saath milakar rode atka rahi he
 Dilip Pandey asked Congress to ask which government's tender document has read 130 crore rupees
 congress janata ko kanphyus kar rahi he
 The reality is that only the negotiation process is going on
 abhi to laagat tay nahin hua he
 Dilip Pandey said on raising the question of Ajay Maken, the man in the cabinet is talking such silly things
 congress party ko bhi aage aakar uparajyapal ko dephend karnaa pad rahaa he
 This proves that the Congress, BJP and LG Sahab's office together want to endanger the interests of the people of Delhi for their politics

 To prove how much Dehradun, the capital of Uttarakhand, has come under the grip of drug dealers, it would be enough to understand that till now last year, the drug business, which has been living in lakhs, has reached crores of figures this year
 doon police kii narkotics workshop main ye aankade saamne aae hai
 Cases of drug addiction in the capital have added to the woes of Doon police
 dehradun police line main doon police ne nashe ke khilaaf kiye is saal kii karrwai kaa lekhajokha pesh kiya
 The statistics presented by the Narcotics Cell and the police have put the police in question
 jin aankadon ko police uplabdhi ke taur par pesh kar rahi thi, usne hi police ke daavon kii pole kholane kaa kaam kiya he
 In Narcotics Workshop, the police said that in 2015, the police have caught more than 2 crores narcotics so far this year, compared to 63 lakhs
 saath hi kareeb 278 logon ko salaakhon ke peeche pahunchaaya he
 But, the same figures are showing that in comparison to 2015, there has been more than double increase in the business of drugs in the capital this year
 kya kehete he police ke aankade?narkotics workshop se mili aankadon kii maane, to saal 2015 main doon police ne 63 lakh 7 hajaar or 845 rupee ke maadak padaarthon kii baramadagi ke saathtascari or bikrikarne vaale 136 logon kii giraftaari hui
 This year, the Doon Police has arrested 278 persons involved in sale and smuggling of narcotics worth Rs 2 crore, 13 lakh, 26 thousand 619 in just 9 months so far
 narkotics padaarthon kii baramadagi ke maamle main rajya ke anya 12 jilon or jiarapy thanon kii gai kul baramadagi se zyada baramadagi akele dehradun police ne kii he
 Why arrest only the pieces? Of the more than 250 people who are claiming the arrest of the police, most of them are youth or students of Doon, who are the pawns of drug dealers
 kai to aise bhi hai jo kai baar jail ja chuke he, lekin police phir bhi unase saudagaron kaa pataa nahin puch pai
 The point here is to look at the work of the police from its figures, which are putting a question mark on the work of the police

 china ke sarkari media ne aaj kaha ki agar bharat, dalai lamas ko arunachal pradesh kii yatra karne kii anumati dekar ghatiya khel kheltaa he to china ko bhi ''eent kaa jawaab pathar se dene main'' hichakana nahin chahie
 Two English newspapers - China Daily and Global Times - have launched a scathing attack on India following the statement of India's Minister of State for Home Kiran Rijiju
 rijiju ne kaha tha ki arunachal pradesh, jise china dakshini tibet kaa hissaa bataata he, vah ''bharat kaa abhinn hissaa he
 Protesting Rijiju's remarks, these newspapers said that India is using the Dalai Lama as a "strategic weapon" against China
 vah aisa isliye kar rahaa he kyonki china ne parmaanu aapurtikarta samooh (enesji) main bharat kii sadsyta or jaish-e-mohammad ke pramukh masood ajahar par sanyukt raashtra ke pratibandh ke khilaaf 'vito jaise majboot' adhikaar kaa istemaal kiya he
 China Daily said in its editorial, "new Delhi not only allowed the 14th Dalai Lama to come to southern Tibet but also took a walk by the junior minister of home affairs of India to the spiritual leader of 'tibetan independence'
" dakshini tibet bharat dwaara avaidh dhang se kabjaya gaya aitihaasik chini kshetra he or bharat use 'arunachal pradesh' kahata he
 "this is a double insult to Beijing," the editorial said
 '' "rijiju may consider himself innocent by taking a line from Beijing's diplomatic representations," the editorial said, but overlooked a fundamental difference here that Tibet, like any other part of Taiwan and China, is part of the Chinese territory Whether New Delhi agrees or not
 '' It said, "on the other hand, Southern Tibet was stolen by his (rijiju's) former colonial masters of the country, taking advantage of China's internal tensions
" yadi rijiju ko dakshini tibet kii sthiti ko lekar koi sawaal ho to vah aitihaasik abhilekhagaaron se sampark kar sakate hai
 "it said," Neither mcmahon Rekha nor the current Arunachal Pradesh have the support of China
 isi rekha ke jariye bharat dakshini tibet par apane asal niyantran ko uchit tehraata he
 In other words, India's occupation of the region is legally indefensible
 isliye iskaa istemaal ek laabh ke taur par karnaa na sirf anuchit he balki avaidh bhi he
 '' Comments in aakraamak sampadakiyon se pehle kal china ne tibeti aadhyatmik netaa kii is kshetra kii yatra par bhartiya rajdoot vijay gokhale ke samaksh virodh darj karaayaa tha

 teen talaak bill (triple Talaq Bill) ko rajyasabha main paas karaane main vipaksh kii bhi badi bhoomika rahi, agar aisa kaha jaae to isamen kuch bhi galat nahin hoga
 According to sources, 20 mps of the opposition were absent from the Rajya Sabha during voting
 is vajah se bahumat kaa aankada 121 se kam ho gaya
 And this bill passed
 bill paas hone ke baad ab vipakshi dal apane aise saansadon se kaaran bataane ko kah rahehain
 The Congress has asked its Rajya Sabha members why the members were not present in the House even after the party issued the whip
 bataa den ki modi sarkaar ‘muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan) vidheyak, 2019' ko rajyasabha main 84 ke mukaable 99 maton se paarit kara liya
 Sources said that if members of the Opposition were present in the House, they could have sent the bill to the Select Committee

 voting ke dauraan ke tii es tulsi bhi anupasthit the jo namit sadsy hai lekin vah vidheyak kaa virodh karte rahe the
 Apart from the non-attendance of members of the opposition party, members of AIADMK, BSP and TRS were also not in the house, which led the government to pass the bill in the upper house
 gauratlab he ki sattarudh dal ke paas upree sadan main bahumat nahin he
 PDP mps also did not participate in voting on the triple talaq bill
 darasal, pidipi ke do saansadon ne upree sadan main bill pesh hone ke baad voting main hissaa nahin liya
 Because of this, the majority figure further reduced
 or modi sarkaar is bill ko paas karaane main safal rahi
 Let me tell you that PDP Party President Mehbooba Mufti said before the bill was introduced in the House that she would not support the government in any way with this bill
 lekin unki party ke do saansadon dwaara voting main hissaa na lene se apratyaksh taur par phayda modi sarkaar ko hi hua
 Let me tell you that Mehbooba Mufti had said a few days ago about the triple talaq bill that the Modi government is trying to enter into our (muslim) homes with the help of this bill
 unhone teen talaak bill ko lekar ek twit bhi kiya
 He wrote that i do not understand why the Modi government is adamant on getting this bill passed, especially when the Supreme Court has declared it illegal
 aisa karnaa sirf musalamaanon ko dand dene ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation when the condition of the country's economy is going so bad, should it be such an important issue for the government? Significantly, the triple talaq bill between the opposition's strong objection and the demand to send the bill to the Select Committee
 ) Passed from Rajya Sabha
 isse pehle vipaksh kii bill ko select cameti main bhejne kii maang bhi sadan main gir gai
 During the voting, 84 votes in favor of sending the bill to the Select Committee, while 100 votes were cast in the protest
 ab is bill ko sweekruti ke liye raashtrapati ke paas bheja jayega
 Passing the triple talaq bill from the Rajya Sabha is considered a major victory of the Modi government
