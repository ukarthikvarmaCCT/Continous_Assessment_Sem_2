 adaalat ne faisla sunaaya ki hatya gavali ke ishaare par kii gai thi
 He has been sentenced to life imprisonment
 25 saal se zyada samay se chal rahe 25 maamalon main pehali baar gavali ko doshi tehraaya gaya he
 Law's hands finally reached the only don living in the Mumbai metropolis
 daaud ibrahim kaa giroh karachi se chalata he; chota rajan dakshin purv asia se giroh chalaata he
 For almost 25 years, Gawli had been standing firmly behind the 15-foot-high walls and iron gates of his base - Dagdi Chal
 pados main central mumbai ke kaamkaaji varg ke bhaikhla main teen acre se adhik main faili imaaraton kaa tang ilaaka uskaa garh tha
 His supporters called him Daddy and when "daddy" used to court, unemployed youth, exempt leaders and disadvantaged people would gather to plead for him
 un sabhi kii najar main, 5 foot 5 inch kaa patale-duble sharir or trademark muunchon vaala don ek nidar robinhood kii tarah tha; jabaki vastav main vah giraftaar hone yaa usase bhi badhkar muthbhed main maare jane ke dar se khud ko chhipaane ke liye chaikanna rahata tha
 There were many hiding places in Dagdi Chawl
 ek police adhikari kehete hai, " 1990 ke dashak main maine 1,000 pulicekarmiyon ke saath puri chaal chaan maari, lekin uskaa pataa nahin laga paaya
 His hideout was very safe
 " ve bataate hai, "vahaan deevaaron or almaari main chhipane kii jagahen thim
 Even Gawli's bed had a pit to hide it
 vah itnaa vahami tha ki usne us karcenter kaa bhi katl kar diya tha, jisane ise banaaya tha
 "gawli stepped into the underworld in the 1970s when he quit his fraternity's traditional milk-selling business
 girgaum ke thakurdwar ke city haai skool main 11veen kaksha bhi puri na pard paane vaale gavali ne 1980 ke dashak main rama nik ke giroh ke liye kaam kiya, jahaan use daaud ke taskari karke laae gaye electronic maal kii khep kii chekasi kerani hoti thi
 He caught the attention of the underworld by killing three gangsters Parasnath Pandey, Sridhar Shetty and Cobra gang leader Shashi Rasam in 1986
 daaud ke saath uskaa jhgada tab hua, jab daaud ne pehle uske guru nik kii hatya kar di, or phir 1990 main uske bhai bappa ko maar diya
 The fight was about a plot, which had an eye on Dawood
 1992 main gavali ke shooter shailesh haldankar ne daaud ke bahanoi ibrahim parkar ko uske nagpada sthit garh main goli se uda diya
 It was a sensational shootout from where the gang war of the 1990s began
 kisi bhi tarah ke halaat ko sampradayik put dene ke liye taiyaar rahane vaale shivasena pramukh bal thakare ne gavali ko daaud ke muslim giroh ke mukaable ek hindu don ke taur par pesh kiya
 After the 1992-93 riots when Gawli joined the Shiv Sena to organize maha-aartis on the streets of Mumbai, Bal Thackeray said at a rally in Dadar, "if you have Dawood, we have Gawli
 "shivasena ke saath gavali kii dosti tab khatm hui, jab usne 1996 main thakare ke sahyogi jayant jadhav or shivasena vidhayak ramesh more ko marava diya
 Apparently because Thackeray was ignoring him
 yahaan tak ki jadhav ke hatyaron ne apane mobile phone se gavali ko phone lagaaya, taaki vah goliyaan chalane kii aawaaj sun sake
 The bjp-shiv Sena government retaliated and started destroying its gang through 'encounters'
 gavali ne 1999 main ek rajnatik party-akhil bhartiya sena-banaai or 2004 main chinchpokali se vidhansabha ke liye chunaa gaya
 Gawli was arrested eight times
 kanoon or vyavastha ke liye khatra maanate hue use 1998 main mumbai se baahar kar pune bhej diya gaya
 He would escape every time for lack of evidence
 uske shooters gavaahon ko dhamka dete the
 In the 1990s, Gawli claimed to have a squad of around 1,000 sharp-shooters
 jarurat padane par unhen jamaanat par chhudaane ke liye vakeelon kaa ek jattha hameshaa phone par hajir rahata tha
 Ironically, it was his trusted aides who implicated him in the murder of Jamsandekar
 is hatyakand kii karrwai main khud shaamil nahin rahe shrikrishna gurav ne ahm jaankariyaan deen or sandip gangan sarkari gavaah ban gaya
 With the help of these two, the Mumbai police succeeded in proving that two builders — Sahebrao Bhintade and Bala Surve, who were Jamsandekar's rival realtors — had given Gawli Rs 30 lakh to kill this councilor in a land dispute
 kii supaari di thi
 Gawli's involvement in the scandal came to light when the crime branch team led by the then joint commissioner Rakesh Maria and deputy commissioner Deven Bharti was arrested in 2008
 2008 main shooter ashok jaiswal or narendra giri ne ikbaalia bayaan darj kara kar gavali kii bhoomika ko kabool kiya or gavali ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 He was shifted to Taloja Jail in Thane in 2010 after initially being kept in Arthur Road Jail
 gavali kii parshad beti gita, jisane gavali kii rajnatik viraasat sambhaal lee he, is sajaa ko bombai hycourt main chunauti dengi
 He says, "this justice has not been done
 " yah sunne main thodaa ajeeb lagata he
 On August 28, hundreds of people gathered in support of Gawli on Dagdi Chawl and outside the MCOCA court
 court se baahar nikalne par gavali muskaraayaa or waapas taloja jail le jane vaali police vine main baithne se pehle usne apane samarthakon kii ore dekhakar haath hilaayaa
 He may have to stay in this prison for a long time
 pakistan main peshawar ke army skool main aatmghaatee hamalavar ghus gaye, or sava sau bacchon ko kaal kaa grass bana diya
 This attack has shaken the whole world, not only Pakistan
 is vaardaat kii chautarafa ninda ho rahi he, lekin pakistani itihaas main kisi bhi skool par hue sabase bade aatankwaadi hamale ke liye kya sirf aatankwaadi hi zimmedaar hai, yaa khud pakistan bhi
 
 
 The aaj kaa insaan apane dukh se itnaa dukhi nahin he, jitna dusron ke sukh ko dekhakar hota he, or yah baat pakistan par puri tarah lagu hoti he
 Ever since Pakistan was formed, it has not liked India's peace and progress
 kabhi punjab main, kabhi kashmir main aatankwaad ko badhaava dekar bharat kii shanti ko bhang karne par tula rahata he pakistan
 
 
 It is the same situation that your home is never stable, but interfering in a foreign house is necessary
 
 
 varsh 2010 main pakistan ke tatkaaleen raashtrapati asif ali zaradaari ne mana tha ki pakistan ne kuch udeshyon kii purti ke liye aatankwaadiyon ko banaaya or aashray diya
 The bombings that killed about 55 people along the Wagah border last month, and now the attack on the school in Peshawar, are proof that 'bhasmasura' is now bent on destroying the builder
 south asia terarysm portal ke mutabik, pakistan main 12 gharelu aatankwaadi sanghathan hai, or usne 32 antarrashtriya aatankwaadi sanghathanon ko panaah de rakhi he
 Since 2002, there have been 405 suicide attacks in Pakistan, in which 6,120 people have been killed and 12,791 injured
 ab pakistan ko samajhnaa hi hoga ki jab babul kaa ped boyaa gaya tha, to aam kahaan se milenge
 Here, one thing seems more ridiculous that Pakistan has interpreted terrorism according to its convenience - good terrorism, bad terrorism
 
 
 jo bharat main hamalaa karte hai, ve pakistan ke liye swatantraaa senaanee (jehadi) hai, or jo pakistan par hamalaa kar rahe he, ve aatankwaadi hai
 Now, according to Pakistan, he has launched many campaigns against terrorists
 aaj peshawar main jo hamalaa hua, vah unheen main se ek abhiyaan kii pratikriya he
 According to the tehreek-e-taliban responsible for the attack, it has retaliated the operation 'zarb-e-azab' in North Waziristan by the Pakistan Army
 ullekhneey he ki pichley chah maah se chal rahe is faujee oparation main 1,858 talibani maare ja chuke hai
 But Pakistan, on the other hand, runs special trains for those terrorists like Hafiz Saeed and Dawood Ibrahim on 26 November, and keeps them at home and gives VIP treatment to those who are 'most wanted' in India
 
 
 pakistan kashmiri algaavvaadiyon se vaarta karata rahata he or bharat ke khilaaf uksaata rahata he
 Yet the thing to see is that despite so many efforts of Pakistan, the condition of Kashmir has not been as bad as Pakistan
 jo kashmiri algaavvaadi bharat or bhartiya sena ko bura-bhala kehete rahete hai or paak kaa gungan karte nahin thakte, kya ve is sachai se anjaan hai ki bhartiya sena kii koshishon ke kaaran hi kashmir nark banane se bachaa hua he
 Otherwise he too would have reached the verge of ruin
 jab bhi kashmir par koi vipatti ai he, bhartiya sena hi dhaal banakar khadi hui he
 It was the Indian Army, which protected the lives and property of the people in the floods
 bich main aisi khabar bhi ai ki logon ko bachaane gai sena kii tukadiyon par patharav hua or kuch sainikon par hamalaa bhi kiya gaya
 Will Pakistan be able to understand the pain of their parents who have died in the school attack in Peshawar? 
 
 ? kya pakistan ab bhi sabak nahin legaa or aatankwaad ke prati apni dohari niti ko nahin badalegaa
 
 
 The And those people in India who consider themselves linked to Pakistan only on the basis of religion, put the Pakistan flag in their homes and cheer for the Pakistan team, would they like to see the future of their future
 
 
 ? The news is confirmed
 mahaj ek aadhikarik bayaan kii aupchaarikta bhar baaki he
 Nitish Kumar is again assuming the chair of the Sebihar CM
 to phir intjaar kis baat kaa he? dilli chunaav ke nateezon kaa
 Yes, Delhi's results are going to have a direct impact on the power of Bihar
 dilli main 7 farvari ko chunaav he or 10 farvari ko nattejey aa jaaenge
 JDU holds a rally at Gandhi Maidan in Patna on 15 February
 bihar main jediu satta main he or philhal jithan ram maanjhi mukhyamantri hai
 BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi also claims that Nitish Kumar can become CM again by replacing Jitan Ram Manjhi as Chief Minister by February 15
 susheel modi kaa ye bayaan siyaasi ho saktaa he, par kaaphi sateek lag rahaa he
 Things are indicating this
 dilli ke nateezon par najaranitish lagaataar aap netaa arvind kejariwal ke samarthan main bayaan de rahe hai
 It seems that in the event of BJP not being able to form a government in Delhi, Nitish Kumar will be happier than Kejriwal and Congress sitting in Bihar
 haal ke unke haav-bhav to yahi jataa rahe hai
 So will the Delhi results be evidence of the power of the Modi wave
 puri tarah to nahin, kaaphi had tak mana ja saktaa he
 Apparently it may not be right, but this discussion was that Nitish left the chair of CM of Bihar only because of Modi
 belgaum ho rahe maanjhijithan ram maanjhi ne jab mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee to unhen nitish kumaar kaa remote control bataaya gaya
 As the days passed, his attitude changed
 raajnneeti ke ek ghute hue khilaadi kii tarah maanjhi nitish shashan kii nitiyon, unke pasandida adhikariyon or yahaan tak kii unke kai dream project ko bhi thikaane lagane main lag gaye
 Manjhi made Nitish Kumar's most loved officer walk
 mana jaataa he ki nitish ke saare dream project unheen kii dekharekh main chalate the
 It is said that neither a leader nor an officer likes that officer except Nitish
 maanjhi ne iskaa puraa phayda uthaaya
 He shot all the targets with a single arrow
 charchaa he ki aise kuch or afasar maanjhi ke nishane par hai
 Manjhi, on the other hand, started giving preference to his people in the bureaucracy
 is tarah wo mahadaliton ke bade netaa ke taur par khud ko sthapit karne main bhi jute gaye
 Many of his statements are examples - and proofs
 fal koi or kyon khaae?badi mushkil se bihar main endie kii sarkaar bani thi
 Then Nitish earnestly achieved the title of Good Governance Babu
 vakt badla, halaat badale or nitish ne bijepi se naata tod liya
 Not only that, he had to meet her with a hug, which was not acceptable to talk about
 ab nitish ko lagata he ki agar door dhili kii to pench fansaa kar lalu prasad yadav use lapakane main koi kasar nahin chodenge
 Legislative assembly elections are to be held by october-november this year
 aise main parde ke peeche lalu maanjhi kii harkaton ko khub hawa dete hai
 Nitish has also understood this
 bijepi alag adnge daalane ke firaaq main rahati he
 When Delhi has been far away, even Patna will not be able to get hold of it - if it has become inferior
 kahin der na ho jaae isliye nitish satark ho gaye hai
 But will Nitish convince Manjhi easily? It does not seem so easy
 maanjhi ek mahadalit ko hi agle mukhyamantri ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Whatever his name may be
 or wo naam nitish kumaar to nahin hai
 The Supreme Court constitutional bench will start hearing on May 11 on the triple divorce case
 garmiyon kii chhuttiyon main paanch jajon kii peeth is par sunwaayee karegi
 CJI Khehar said that this is the time to complete the hearing in the case

 saath hi kaha ki muslim personal lau ko samvidhan ke tahat dharmik swatantraaa ke adhikaar ke tahat protection he

 kaha gaya ki kya ye tripal talaak aadi ke khilaaf daakhil yachika vichaar yogya he
 Can personal law be tested as a test of fundamental rights? kya court dharm or dharmik lekh kii vyakhya kar saktaa he
 Muslim personal law is protected in Articles 25, 26 and 29 of the Constitution and whether it can be interpreted or reviewed
 ol india muslim personal lau board ne kaha ki 16 farvari ko supreme court ne aadesh main kaha tha ki tamaam pakshakaar is maamle main likhit jawaab pesh karen

 There is an interesting contradiction in Mazaz's life: While many generations of the country have grown up thinking about the life and times of the poet of Guru Dutt's 'pyaasa', very few people know that this film is a romantic and revolutionary poet
 Is based on the life of Mazaz
 majaaz ne apni shaayari main apni saanskrithik or tatkaaleen saamaajik-rajnatik duniya ko jaahir kiya or ek krantikari duniya kaa khaakaa pesh kiya
 In this way, they transcended their country-age and became part of the universal experience and because of this they are equally relevant today
 'noujvaan khatun se' unka yah kahana aaj ke daur main kitna samayik he ki'tere maathe pe ye anchal bahut hi khub he lekin tu is anchal se ek paracham bana leti to acha tha'mitu ke is daur main auraton ne maano itnaa saahas jagaa liya or anchal ko paracham bana hi liya
 (he reportedly wrote this on Nazm Nargis, who had gone to get his autograph) Asrarul Haque Majaz or Majaz Lakhanvi (born: 19 October 1911 — Dehn: 5 December 1955) was a reformist and rebel poet of the then literary world
 is shaayar ne uttar pradesh main prachlit bhashaa kaa bhi prayog kiya, jaisaa ki 'nanhee pujaarin' main dikhataa he
 He called the younger priest in this as Sita
 unki maanavtaa or dharmanirpekshata unke is sher main dikhti he: 'hindu chalaa gaya na musalmaan chalaa gaya / insaan kii justaju main ek insaan chalaa gaya
 At that time, the Left was dominated in Urdu literature in which the emphasis was on secularism and humanism
 hindu-muslim ekta ke bade pairokaar or dharmanirpeksh mulyon kaa paalan karne vaale majaaz ne aligarh muslim uniwarsity kaa taraana likhaa he: 'yah meraa chaman he, meraa chaman / main apane chaman kaa bulbul hum
 'majaz was the leading poet of Prakash Tehreek, including celebrities like Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Ali Sardar Jafri, Ismat Chugatai, Manto
 unhone ol india radio yaa akashwani main 'aawaaj' ke sampadak ke taur par kaam kiya lekin angrej adhikari ke saath vaicharik matbhed or apni bhinn rachanaatmak abhiruchi kii vajah se naukari chhod di
 This poet was so sensitive and sure of the tune that he would take everything to heart and probably drink alcohol on his life
 teen baar unhen nervas brakedown hua (ranchi ke maansik rog aspataal—mental asilam—main majaaz kii mulaakaat bangla ke diggaj kavi kaaji najarul islam se hui or unhone majaak main kaha ki (agar asilam main hi rahanaa he to ) ve is mental asilam kii jagah lahore yaa dhaka jaakar asilam (panaah) maang sakate hai
 ) The Mazaz bifurcating country was a symbol of hope and change
 ve lakhanu chhodkar aligarh or phir dilli aa gaye jisase unhen sanbhalane kaa mauka mili
 But due to the indifference of the people, this poet died in a tavern on a cold night
 ab majaaz ke andaaj par gaur karte hai: majaaz kii shaayari layaatmak he, yani use gunaguna sakate hai, jisamen paaramparik rupakon kaa istemaal he or usamen lakshanik arth nihit hai (jaraa gaur karen: ye rupahali chhaanv or akaash par taron kaa jaal / jaise sufi kaa tasawwur, jaise aashiq kaa khyal)
 He was a link to a long cultural heritage as he belonged to the lineage of Sufi (hazrat Osman Harooni) and writers-poets
 majaaz pyaar, araju or duniya ke prati romani najariya rakhte the haalanki unki khwaahish krantikari sudhaar / saamaajik badlaav khaskar mahilaon kii bhoomika main badlaav kii thi
 Mazaz wrote the 'song of laborers' and awakened his soul in it (see how:' With hard work these are broken, we are far from comfortable
 par ladane par majaboor hai ham / majdoor hai ham majdoor hai ham
 
 
 Every day they revolt / doom the world
 khwaabon ko hakeekat kar denge / majdoor hai ham majdoor hai ham
 ) Faiz, in the role of Majhaz's 'ahang', wrote that Majaz does not beat the drum of the revolution, he hums it
 talat mahmud or aashaa bhonsle ne unki 'aawaara' najm ke kuch hisse gaae hai, jinhen aaj bhi kaaphi makabuuliyat hasil he (i game dil kya karun, i vahshate dil kya karun)
 In this, some glimpse of Ghalib's "ishq Mujhon Nahin Wahh Hahi Hi Hathi" can be seen
 isi tarah majaaz ke 'chhalke teri ankhon se sharaab or zyada, mahake tere aarij ke gulab or zyada, allaah kare jor-e shabaab or zyada' (unka jashn-e saalagirah) kii jhalak hasarat jaipuri ke gane 'chhalke teri ankhon se sharaab or bhi zyada' main saaf dikhti he
 It is said that during the making of the film Pyaasa, Sahir Ludhianvi told Guru Dutt about Mazaz's life in detail and the character of the poet of that film is actually inspired by the life of Mazaz
 film kaa ek kirdaar darasal majaaz kii do linon ko gunagunaata he
 He was called 'jaggan' in the house as he used to stay awake at night
 shaayad yah unke jaagrit avasthaa ko bhi darshata he kyonki unhone apni shaayari ke jariye jeevanabhar logon ko jagaane or badlaav ke prati jaagruk kiya
 This freedom scholar initially kept his martyrdom as 'martyr'
 kuch log kehete hai ki ve apane jivan ke lakshya kaa gungan karte-karte shahid ho gaye
 He is called Keats of India because of romantic shayari, like Keats he passed away in his youth
 majaaz kaa mijaaz shant, samvedansheel or sundarataa kaa kaayal tha
 Memorabilia: In this photo, Mazaz has nieces, nieces and nephews

 Jyotishpeethadheeshwar, Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati objected to the 'har Har Har Modi' slogan of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi
 shankaracharya swaroopanand saraswati ne kaha ki har-har mahadev kii tarah har-har modi kaa naaraa diya janaa sanathan parampara ke khilaaf he
 Mahadev is God and Modi is human
 is tarah insaan ko bhagwaan ke baraabar prachaarit kiya ja rahaa he
 This is not acceptable under any circumstances
 saraswati ne aage kaha ki vah modi ke virdohi nahin he, balki modi to unke ashram main bhi aa chuke hai, magar jo naaraa diya ja rahaa he, vah hindu manyata va aasthaa ke khilaaf he
 People associated with Shankaracharya say that Swami Swaroopanand has also conveyed this feeling to Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh

 Now the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi has also conducted an investigation on its behalf
 dilli ke grahamantri satyendra jain kaa kahana he ki is maamle main doshi logon par bahut sakht kaarywai kii jaayegi

 chunaav ayog se mulaakaat ke baad congress ke varisht netaa kapil sibbal ne kaha ki amit shah ne telugana main congress ke ghoshnaptr ke bare main galatabayani kii he
 Fact Check: bjp's claim on Telangana Congress manifesto is misleading, saying that Shah has tried to spoil the communal atmosphere
 hamane chunaav ayog se aagrah kiya ki iske liye shah ko notice jari kiya jaae
 He referred to Shah's statement in a Telangana public meeting in which the BJP president attacked the Congress over the alleged electoral promise of providing free electricity to mosques and churches in the state
 chandrashekhar raav ko kathith taur par dhamkee dene ke maamle main revant reddy kii aihtiyathan giraftaar kaa mudda uthaate hue sibbal ne kaha ki chunaav ke samay yah sab kiya gaya he or is par ayog ko sangyaan lenaa chahie
 Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee President Kamal Nath said that there are a lot of complaints about evms from the state that the officials are fudging

 Shah made this claim while speaking at a rally in Amangal in Rangareddy district of Telangana
 congress ke liye amit shah ne kaha, “mitron inhone vaada kiya he masjid or carch kii bijli maaf karenge, main unako poochta hum bhaiya mandir kaa kya dosha he, mandiron kii bijli kyon maaf nahin karoge, sirf masjid or carch kii hi karoge

 aisi sthiti isiilie ban rahi he kyonki dilli main hawa do se teen kimi pratighante kii raftaar se chalengi, jisase pradooshit kan vaataavaran main pravaah nahin ho paaenge
 These particles will become smog due to moisture present in the air

 According to meteorologists, the wind speed from the south-west direction will remain low in the coming days

 CM Chandrababu Naidu met the Election Commission in Delhi and said that the Election Commission has lost its credibility as it is acting on the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his office
 dilli main naidu ne ayog kii swatantraaa or paardarshita par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki chunaav ayog loktantr kaa anivaary gun kho chukaa he
 Naidu said that the officials in Andhra Pradesh were arbitrarily transferred and the Chief Secretary was replaced by a person who was accused in a case along with YSR Congress chief Jagan Mohan Reddy
 bataa den ki andhra pradesh main chunaav ke dauraan kai jagahon par EVM main kharabi kii khabaren ain thi

 Chandrababu Naidu supported the demand raised by all opposition parties to link at least 50 per cent of electronic voting machines to vvpats and said that the Supreme Court ordered to increase the number of evms with vvpats to five in each assembly constituency
 Yes, that's not enough
 11 april ko andhra pradesh ke chunaav ke dauraan unhone mukhya chunaav ayukta se voting ke dauraan 35 fisadi iviem main hui gadabadi ke bare main shikaayat kii

 '' darasal, aadhe se zyada logon kii maut gaurikund or kedarnath ke bich ke paidal raste main hui he, jahaan samay par chikitsa suvidha nahin mili
 When the pilgrims from the plains ascend the altitude when the journey starts from Gaurikund, their body tries to keep pace with the odd mountain conditions and climate

 There is no health facility in this way

 This system of checkup should start from Rishikesh itself

 The former Chief Health Officer who took care of health facilities in Kedarnath for many years vashishtha kehete hai ki swasthya vibhaag ko yatra maarg main halke oxigen silendar uplabdh karaane chahie
 The use of masks should be encouraged to avoid the dirt and dust of horse droppings on the road
 ve kehete hai, ''tirthayatriyon ke liye rigerv jivan rakshak dawaaen viypi yatriyon ko to mil jaati hai, lekin aam jaruratmand yatriyon ko nahin

 com / nh6rrwxylm— ANI (@ani_news)february 23, 2016 Presidential candidate Pranab Mukherjee resigned as the Honorary President of the Indian Statistical Institute on June 20, a week before he resigned as Union Finance Minister and filed nominations for the presidential election
 yah baat ek adhikari ne somvaar ko kahi
 Simultaneously, the official dismissed allegations by opposition presidential candidate PA Sangma that Pranab was not eligible to contest
 bhartiya sankhyikeey santhaan ke ek varisht adhikari ne kolkata se bataaya, "unhone 20 june ko hi istipha de diya tha
 The confusion arose because it was not updated on the institute's website
 " Sangma, the presidential candidate backed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has demanded the cancellation of Mukherjee's presidential candidature
 unhone mukherjee par laabh ke ek pad par bane rahane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The comments adhikari ne kaha ki vipakshi kheme se lagaae gaye aaropon ke baad mukherjee kaa naam santhaan kii website se somvaar ko hataa diya gaya
 An official of Mukherjee's residence at 13 Talkatora Road in New Delhi also said that the allegations are baseless
 adhikari ne is baat kii bhi pushti kii ki mukherjee ne kendriya vitt mantri ke pad se istipha dene se ek saptaah pehle 20 june ko hi bhartiya sankhyikeey santhaan se istipha de diya tha
 a senior Indian Statistical Institute official told Kolkata, "he resigned only on June 20
 bhram isliye paidaa hua, kyonki santhaan kii website par ise apadet nahin kiya gaya
 " gyaat ho ki bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) dwaara samarthit raashtrapati ummidavaar sangama ne mukherjee kii raashtrapati pad kii ummidavaari radd karne kii maang kii he

 Since the Facebook data leaks, the company's difficulties are not being named
 ab fasebuk siio mark jakarberg ke kareebi or company ke aalaa adhikari rahe andryu basworth kaa ek internal memo saamne aayaa he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki ham kisi bhi keemat par growth chaahate hai
 The Bajfeed report talks about Facebook's internal memo, in which Facebook's Vice President Andrew Bosworth said, "we connect people, so whatever we do for our growth is justified
" chaahe wo bhashaa ho jo ek duusare ko jodatii he or logon ko dhundne laayak banaati he
 All the work that is done to bring more communication
 wo kaam jo ham china main bhi kabhi karenge
 Everything is right, 'according to the Buzzfeed report, he wrote in the memo,' We connect more people
 agar log ise nakaaratmak banaate hai to yah bura he
 Perhaps it can also take someone's life ', he wrote,' due to our tools one can possibly be killed in a terrorist attack ', according to Buzzfeed, the name of this internal memo is' The Ugly'
 yah memo 18 june 2016 kaa he
 Things written in this memo that you should know - we connect people to each other - if people make it positive then it is a good thing
 log shaayad yahaan pyaar paa sakate hai
 Perhaps it can also save lives
 isliye ham logon ko conect karte hai
 - If people make it negative then it is bad
 shaayad yah dusron kii galat harkaton ko ujagar karke unki jindagi khatre main daal saktaa he
 Perhaps because of our tools, someone can also lose his life in a terrorist attack - the bad truth is that we believe so much in connecting people that whatever we have to do for this, it will be really good
 is memo se ek cheez nikal kar aati he jokaphi khatarnaak he or wo ye he ki fasebuk logonko conect karne ke liye kisi bhi had tak ja saktaa he
 a question also arises as to whether Facebook can even put people in danger to connect to them
 Following this report by Bajfeed, a top Facebook official who wrote this memo, Bosworth has tweeted
 isamen unhone kaha he ki wo bajfid kii is report se sahamat nahin hai
 He has said, 'the purpose of writing this post or other such post was to bring such issues to the surface, which i thought should be brought to the surface and should be discussed' CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also released his statement through a company spokesperson
 unhone kaha he ki fasebuk ne 2017 main bade badlaav kiye hai
 The statement said, 'bosworth is a talented leader and the people working on Facebook and i do not agree with this report

 pranab ke is bayaan kii vyakhya yuva netaa ke pradhanmantri pad ke agle ummidavaar ke rup main pesh kiye jane ke rup main dekhi ja rahi he
 Asked whether the Congress would follow bjp's initiative to introduce a new face as a future leader, Pranab said, "we are always in favor of a new leadership
" rahul gandhi hamaare nae netaa banane ja rahe hai
 Pranab's statement is considered very important when Congress leaders have supported Rahul Gandhi as the future leader and future Prime Minister
 veerbhum jile main apane paitrik nivas par durga puja samaaroh ke dauraan unhone kaha, bhaajapa kya kar rahi he, yah uskaa aantarik maamla he
 Pranab also questioned the bjp's performance in the recent assembly elections in various states
 unhone kaha, unka pradarshan kaisaa rahaa? pichley chunaav main unhone 725 siton par chunaav ladaa
 How many seats did he win? Now let's see his performance in the upcoming elections
 jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay chaatr sangh (jeenuasu) chunaav main shuukravaar ko 67
 Voting was 9 percent
 mana ja rahaa he ki pichley saat saal ke mukaable is baar sabase zyada matdaan hua he
 67 last year
 8 fisadi matdaan hua tha
 The JNUSU Election Committee on Friday accused the Dean of Students of 'interfering' in the election process by entering the polling station during the first phase of voting
 shuukravaar ko matdaan main kul 8,488 panjikrut matadaataaon main se 5,762 chaatr-chaatro ne matdaan kiya
 The Delhi High Court on Friday stayed the declaration of the results of the student union elections till 17 September
 is maamle kii sunwaayee 17 sitambar ko hogi
 The court said in its order that the declaration of the final result would depend on the court's further orders
 iske baad adaalat ne vishvavidhyalay ko agali sunwaayee tak parinaam nahin jari karne kaa nirdesh diya
 There are 14 candidates in the fray for various positions in the election
 maton kii ginati raat nau baje se shuru honi thi
 Election Committee Chairman Shashank Patel said, 'the Chairman of the Grievance Redressal Cell, who is also the Dean of Students, interfered in the election process by going inside the polling station
 yah lingadoh samiti kii siforeeshon or ucch nyaayalay ke ek aadesh kaa spasht ulanghan he
 'dean Umesh Kadam did not respond to phone and messages on the issue
 aane vaale maheene main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar chunaav purv surveykshan ke prasaaran or prakaashan par chunaav ayog ke roak lagane kii sambhaavna nahin he kyonki ayog ne vidhi mantralay se kaha he ki vah samvidhan ke tahat praapt adhikaar kaa upyog kar aisa kadam nahin uthaanaa chahta he or vah chahta he ki sarkaar is mudde par kanoon banaae
 Shortly before, the Law Ministry had suggested to the Election Commission that it can ban the pre-election survey by exercising its powers under Article 324
 ayog ne iskaa jawaab dete hue sarkaar se kaha ki is bare main kanoon bananaa behatar vichaar hoga
 The Election Commission feels that prohibiting pre-election survey under Article 324 will not be legally maintainable
 ayog ne vidhi mantralay se kaha ki chunki eczit pole kanoon ke tahat pratibandhit he, chunaav purv surveykshan ke bare main bhi isi tarah kii prakriya apanaayi jaani chahie
 The Election Commission has proposed that after notification of Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections, broadcasting and publication of election survey should be banned from the commencement of elections till the completion of the final phase of voting
 vartmaan kanoon ke tahat chunaav ayog ko matdaan se 48 ghante pehle chunaav purv surveykshan ko pratibandhit karne kii anumati praapt he
 Earlier this year, the Attorney General supported the proposal of the Election Commission to ban the broadcast and publication of pre-poll surveys amid the final phase of voting from the announcement of the election schedule
 chunaav purv surveykshan par pratibandh lagane kaa samarthan karte hue aterni general ne kaha ke eczit pole par roak lagane ke liye sanshodhan ke teen varsh ho gaye hai or ise koi chunauti milti nahin dikh rahi he

 This is confirmed by information received from Mumbai Police
 soochna kaa adhikaar (artiai) ke tahat maangi gai jaankaree se pataa chalaa he ki mumbai main har roj 7 se 8 mahilaayein kisi na kisi aarope main giraftaar ho rahi hai
 Most of these cases are of domestic violence and physical abuse
 jaankaron kii maane, to gharelu hinsa main dahej hinsa, mahilaon ko jalaana, maarna-peetna, saas-bahu main hinsak jhagade hona jaise maamle hai
 The accused women are lodged in rough jails in and around Mumbai, or out on bail
 mumbai police ke pravaktaa mahesh patil kehete hai, 'adhiktar maamle socity yaa slam main hone vaale aapasi jhagade, marpet, dahej yaa gharelu hinsa ke hote hai, jisamen mahilaayein shaamil hoti hai
 These include 5-7 women executing the incident in a single incident
 isaki tulana main murder yaa jaanaleva hamale jaise maamalon main mahilaayein kaaphi kam sankhya main shaamil hoti hai
 'on the other hand, even after enacting laws to educate women or protect women, women are being victimized day by day
 artiai se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, 2011 ke mukaable 2013 main 11 fisadi adhik mahilaon ko vibhinn aparaadhik maamalon main giraftaar kiya gaya
 While 2599 women were arrested for committing crimes in 2011, the figure reached 2797 by 30 November 2013
 agar 2011, 2012 or 2013 ko milakar aakadon kii baat karen to kul 7934 mahilaon ko giraftaar kiya ja chukaa he
 It is clear from the data that while crimes against women are increasing, the same women are also getting involved in criminal incidents quite fast
 artiai kaaryakarta anil galgalli ke mutabik, 'sarkaar or police mahakama donon hi mahilaon ko suraksha dene main asafal sabit ho rahe hai
 Women do not have fear of police and law and they are committing criminal incidents day by day

 North Delhi Mayor Adesh Gupta appeared in a different style on Monday
 aam taur par apni car se daftar aane vaale meyar somvaar ko cycle se civik centre pahunche
 Actually, on the occasion of World Cycle Day, North Delhi Mayor Adesh Gupta reached MCD Headquarters Civic Center from his house in Patel Nagar
 is dauraan meyar ne kareeb 10 kilometre tak cycle chalaai
 Apart from the mayor, Charol Bihari, chairman of Karol Bagh ward committee, vice-president Tejaram Four, councilor Alok Sharma and Yogesh Verma also accompanied him to the civic headquarters Civic Center by bicycle
 is maukey par meyar ne kaha ki dilli main vaayu pradooshan kii samasya kaaphi bad gai he jisase nipatane ke liye cycle or pradooshan naa failaane vaale anya electronic vaahanon kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 Mayor Gupta said that while coming from the house to the civic center, he also advised the drivers to try to use the bicycle for short distance travel
 saath hi, raste main logon ko sadak par kooda na failaane or swatchta ke prati jaagruk bhi kiya jisase dilli ko saaf-suthra banaaya ja sake
 The mayor said that there are 25 cycle stands in North Delhi from where citizens can avail bicycle facilities on hire
 iske alaava meyar ne nagarikon se hafte yaa maheene main kam se kam ek baar cycle kaa prayog avashya karne kii apil kii
 He said that this will not only bring health benefits but will also help in making the city pollution free
 antarrashtriya redcrass ne kaha he ki haiti main aae vinaashkari bukamp main kareeb 40 se 50 hajaar log maare gaye hai
 Xavier Castellanos, head of the American Federation of the International Federation of Red Cross and the Red Crescent Society, said, "the main figures will be given by the government of Haiti, and they are saying that 40 to 50 thousand people are killed
" ’unhone kaha, ‘is ghatana kii bhayavahata bataati he ki marane waalon kii sankhya zyada hogi or sarkaar kii ore se jari aankade sahi vishwasaneey honge
 "at least 3 million people have been directly affected by this earthquake," Castellanos said
 iskaa matlab he ki yahaan kii kul jansankhya kaa ek tihaai hissaa
 'haiti officials have previously said that at least 100,000 people have died in this earthquake
 2019 calocabhachunaav ke liye siyaasi sargarmi tej ho gai he
 Both Congress and BJP parties have started using their political weapons
 congressrafel deal ke jariye modi sarkaar ko gherne kii koshishon main juty he
 In such a situation, the FIR filed in the land deal case against Sonia Gandhi's Damad Robertwadrack has got a big issue
 bataa den ki haryana main hooda sarkaar ke dauraan 2008 main gurugram ke sector-83 main robert wadra kii company skylite hospitality privet limited ne 3
 7 to 5 acres
 5 karod rupye main kharida tha
 Which he later sold to DLF for Rs 58 crore
 is maamle main robert wadra or haryana ke purv mukhyamantri bhoopendra singh hooda ke khilaaf exiaar haryana main exiaar darj kii gai he
 The Congress said that with assembly elections in four states and Lok Sabha elections coming up next year, the Modi government is taking malicious action to spread propaganda
 congress netaa surajevaala ne kaha ki yahrafeld or notebanti 'ghotaale', dijal or petrol ke daamon main badhotari karke 12 lakh karod kii lut, rupye kii girti keemton va asafal arthvyavastha se dhyaan bantane ke liye aisa kiya ja rahaa he
 He accused the BJP government of introducing new 'fabricated lies' against political opponents through false and fake cases
 bijepi netaa nalin kohli ne kaha ki robert wadra kaa bijness model desh main kisi ko samaj main nahin aayaa he
 Congress should explain that a person takes someone's land without investing any money and then sells it back
 unhone kaha ki agar congress kahati he ki isamen kuch galat nahin he, to wo desh ko bataae
 The way the entire Congress camp is surrounding Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Rafale issue
 isse bijepi baikfoot par khadi najar aa rahi thi
 In such a situation, the Congress is looking restless after the FIR was registered against Robert Vadra
 jabaki haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter kii maane to kanoon apana kaam kar rahaa he, isamen kisi bhi tarah kii koi badale kii karrwai nahin he
 Interestingly, through Robert Vadra, the BJP targeted the Gandhi family in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 arvind kejariwal ne bhi us samay is mudde ko jamkar hawa diya tha
 During the 2014 elections, Narendra Modi had said, 'A young man studying in class X, who had Rs 1 lakh in his pocket and got Rs 300 crore in three years
 aisa jaadugar, maa-bete kaa ye model he
 This is the business of mother and son
 2 ji kaa to suna tha, lekin ab jija ji kaa bhi sun liya
 If we look at the questions of the Congress, you will find that the allegations of land scam are old, but the way the BJP has used the new arrow of quiver in this case
 iske peeche kahin na kahin 2019 loksabhaa chunaav pramukh mana ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, the Rafale vs Robert issue will figure prominently in this election

 "he said," An early solution to the border issue fulfills the aspirations of the people on both sides and we all know that the boundary question has been going on since history and it cannot be resolved overnight

 'the article is titled,' Will modi-china visit strengthen china-india relations? ' bhartiya vaayu sena ke mig 21 vimaanon ko 'udata taabut' tak kaha jaataa he
 How many pilots have lost their unfortunate deaths due to such aircraft
 buudhvaar ko himachal pradesh ke kangra main ek durghatana main jaan ganvaa dene vaale payalat meet kumaar bhi aisa hi ek vimaan lekar ude the jise kaayade se 'dikmishnd' ho janaa tha, yani seva se baahar kiya janaa chahie tha
 Minutes before the death, Wing Commander Meet Kumar contacted the Air Traffic Control (ATC) of Pathankot Air Base over the radio and sought permission to return immediately
 wing commander kumaar ne pathankot airbase se kareeb 12
 The flight took off at 20 and their mig plane crashed shortly after
 vah tip 75 mig 21 vimaan lekar ude the, jise vaayu sena kaa doosraa sabase purana ladaaku vimaan mana jaataa he
 'oh, is everything alright sir?' ATC asked the wing commander, to know if the fighter aircraft was operating properly
 vimaan kii haal main hi kareeb 200 ghante ke udaan ke baad servicing kii gai thi
 Kumar was flying from 'first Air Test Shorty' which is used for normal operational flight only
 is tarah ke vimaan aamtaur par anbhavi payalton dwaara hi udaae jate hai
 Wing Commander Kumar has 800 hours of experience flying mig-21 aircraft
 wing commander ne atisi ko jawaab diya ki badalon kii vajah se 'first air test shorty' ke liye mausam ke maanak upyukt nahin hai
 ATC allowed them immediate landing, but the mig-21 aircraft had disappeared from the radar
 iske kuch hi minuton main pathankot base ke bhartiya vaayu sena ke 26 squadran kii ashanka sach sabit ho gai, vimaan krash ho chukaa tha
 Investigations have been ordered into the matter as to how the accident and wing commander Kumar died
 jaanch ke baad hi pukhta ho paaegaa ki isaki vajah kya thi
 But there are two things to consider
 tip 75 mig 21 vimaan kaa auto payalat or wing commander kumaar kaa udaan ghanton kaa anubhav donon best maane jate hai
 Significantly, pilots put the aircraft into auto-pilot mode in case of badges
 lekin asli baat yah he ki tip 75 mig 21 vimaanon ko ek saal pehle hi dikmishnd yani seva se baahar kar diya janaa chahie tha
 a highly placed source confirmed to India today-aaj Tak that these aircraft, ideally, should have been put out of service in 2010-15
 gauratlab he ki vaayu sena ke paas 9tejas ladaaku vimanhai, lekin inamen se kisi ko bhi abhi oparational udaan kii manjuuri nahin mili he
 The sad part is that the Air Force will continue to use Type-75 mig-21 aircraft for a few more years
 asal main bhartiya vaayu sena ko seemaa par apni majbootee banaae rakhane ke liye kam se kam 42 squadran ladaaku vimaanon kii tainaati rakhni jaruri he, lekin agar tip-75 mig 21 vimaanon ko seva se hataa liya jaae to vaayu sena ke paas 30 squadran se bhi kam ladaaku vimaan rah jaaenge
 Three soldiers were drowned when a national rifle vehicle slipped off the road in the flood-ravaged Chenab river in Kishtwar district of Jammu and Kashmir

 The vehicle was going from Thathri towards Drabshala and it fell into the river at Kuligarh, 200 km from Jammu
 police ne kaha ki sena kaa vaahan (sena jonga) jab nadi main gir rahaa tha to ek jawan baahar kud gaya
 He is hurt
 uski pahchaan rashtriya rifl ke jawan ke parmaar singh bhai ke rup main kii gayi he
 He said that the vehicle and three people in it have drowned in the river

 The agitation of farmers in Madhya Pradesh has taken a violent form
 police kii firing main 6 kisaanon kii maut ho gayi he
 In the meantime, questions are beginning to arise that before the elections, all political parties make promises like the right price of the crop, including the debt waiver of the farmers
 lekin chunaav jeetne ke baad kisaanon kii samasyaayein bhula di jaati hai
 The reality is also something like this
 sarkaar badalati hai, sattadhari partiyaan badalati hai, lekin kisaanon kii badahaali kii tasviir nahin badal paati
 Meanwhile, the question is also whether the parties really get political benefit from promises like farmers 'loan waiver? In UP, the BJP got a promise of farmers' debt waiver in the UP Assembly elections 2017
 khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ne chunavi jansabha main pradesh ke kisaanon kaa karj maaf karne kaa vaada kiya
 Modi addressed the farmers directly and called for a decision on loan waiver of farmers in the first cabinet meeting after the BJP government was formed in UP
 modi ke is apil kaa asar chunaav nateezon main najar aayaa
 In UP, BJP got a thumping majority
 sarkaar banane ke baad upi ke siem yogi adityanath ne piem modi kaa kisaanon se kiya gaya vaada nibhaayaa or 36 hajaar karod kaa karj maaf kar diya
 Congress benefited in 2009 Congress-led UPA government decided in 2008 to waive the debt of farmers across the country
 manmohan sarkaar ne kisaanon kaa 65 hajaar karod kaa karj maaf kiya
 This major decision of the Manmohan government was heavily discounted by the Congress leaders in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 nateeja ye hua ki ek baar centre main congress kii sarkaar bani
 The BJP-INLD alliance had got the BJP in Haryana with a promise of victory
 bijepi or indian neshnal lokdal ne 1987 kaa vidhansabha chunaav gathbandhan main ladaa
 The coalition gave a debt waiver slogan before the assembly elections
 nateeja ye hua ki 90 main se 76 siton par gathbandhan jeet mili or devilal ke netritv main sarkaar bani
 The government waived the loans of the cooperative banks of up to 25 thousand rupees to the farmers
 bhale hi upi main bijepi, centre main congress or haryana main bijepi-inelo gathbandhan ko karjamaafee ke vaade kaa phayda chunaav main mila ho
 But there have also been times when the parties felt disappointed
 punjab main kejariwal hue failaam aadmi party ne 2017 vidhansabha chunaav main kisaanon ke liye kai bade vaade kiye
 The manifesto was released in Moga for the farmers
 ghoshnaptr main 2018 tak sabhi kisaanon ko karj mukt karne kaa vaada kiya gaya
 Also, promised 12 hours free electricity to farmers, compensation of Rs 20 thousand per acre for crop failure and Rs 10 thousand to farmers every month for lack of work
 arvind kejariwal ke ye tamaam vaade punjab main unki party ko satta ke shikhar tak nahin pahunchaa sake or congress ke captain ne badal sarkaar ke khilaaf bah rahi hawaaon kaa rukh apni taraf mode liya
 Compensation for the farmers of Delhi did not come even before the promise of loan waiver in Kamnapub, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal claimed to give the highest compensation to the farmers of Delhi
 2015 main arvind kejariwal ne 70 pratishat or usase adhik fasal kaa nuksaan jhel rahe kisaanon ko 20 hajaar rupee prati acre kaa muaavja diya
 Kejriwal claimed the highest compensation
 2017 main jab emsidi chunaav hue to kejariwal kii party yahaan bhi satta hasil nahin kar saki or teenon emsidi par bijepi ko fatah mili
 VP Singh also did not get any benefit
 In 1990, Prime Minister VP Singh decided to waive farmers' debt
 tattakaaleen centre sarkaar ne kisaanon kaa 10,000 rupee tak kaa karj maaf kiya
 However, the central government's additional debt of Rs 10,000 crore was also borne by the farmers' debt waiver
 iske baad 1991 main jab loksabhaa chunaav hue centre main satta parivartan ho gaya or congress kii sarkaar bani
 However, once a party has benefited on the issues of farmers, then their promises have failed to overcome their destiny
 par hakeekat ye he ki karj se pareshaan kisaan aaj bhi aatmahatya kar rahe hai
 By 2011-15, 2 lakh 34 thousand 642 farmers of the country have committed suicide in 15 years
 partiyaan or sarkarein bhale hi unke karj maaf karne ke daawey karti hon lekin deshbhar ke kisaanon par aaj bhi 12 lakh 60 hajaar karod kaa karj bakaayaa he
 BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj has accused the UP government of adopting a dual policy on compensation
 dadri hinsa maamle ko mudda banaate hue unhone mangalvaar ko kaha ki rajya main hinsa kii or bhi ghatnaayen hui hai, lekin unamem peediton ko aarthik madad kyon nahin di gai
 Sakshi Maharaj said, 'there have been more incidents of violence in Uttar Pradesh
 bahut se logahinsa se peeditahue hai, lekin unako kabhi muaavja nahin mila
 Why is there such a dual policy? ”he said while attacking the law-administrator in UP, when SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav himself said that there is no law and order in the state, how did he become so unreasonable
 sakshi maharaj ne sapa netaa or rajya sarkaar main mantri ajam khan ko bhi nishane par liya
 He said, 'the way Dadri incident is being politicized, it is condemnable
 ab aaj ajam khan bhi vahaan ja rahe hai
 The BJP MP said, 'just like we have our own mother, so is our mother India and so is our cow mother
 koi hamaari maa kaa apmaan karegaa to mar jaaenge, lekin sahan nahin karenge
 ' upi police ne karodon kaa farjivada karne vaale ek thag ko giraftaar kiya he
 This thug used to cheat in the name of allotting plots, getting government jobs and getting fake degrees by putting his red light, long carriage, tricolor flag on it and chairman's number plate
 varisht police adheekshak arpies yadav ne bataaya ki buudhvaar kii shaam krime branch kii team thana sarasava ke antargat shahjahanpur police chaowkee par checking kar rahi thi

 ve apane bacchon ke saath yojanaon par charchaa karne ke liye chuttee lete hai or trekking kii chhuttiyon ke liye pahaado par nikal jate hai*** If Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister, the BJP did not get tired of praising the development model of Gujarat across the country
 isi gujarat vikaas model ke rath par savaar hokar narendra modi ne 2014 main dilli kii gaddi ko fatah kar liya
 At the same time, Modi's stature became so big that under his shadow only the entire BJP remained subdued
 ise raajnneetik vidambnaa hi kaha jayega ki chunavi rajpath par jo vikaas kaa ghoda 2014 main modi ke liye sarapat dauda tha, ab usee ke liye gujarat main hi kaha ja rahaa he- ‘vikaas gando thayo che’ yani ‘vikaas pagal ho gaya he’
 Before the assembly elections in Gujarat, the echo of 'vikas Gando Thayo Chhe' was heard so loudly that Modi himself had to come to Gujarat and say - 'hoon Vikas Chun, Hoon Gujarat Chun' i
e
 'I am Vikas, i am Gujarat
 ’modi kii gujarat main mukhyamantri ke taur par tajposhi ko paanch maheene bhi puure nahin hue the ki 2002 main godhra kii ghatana ke baad rajya ne hinsa kaa bheeshan daur dekha
 From here, such a tide of 'hindutva' arose that the 'modi era' made a strong entry into Gujarat
 lekin sheeghra hi modi kaa ‘wibrant gujarat’ jaise ranneetik daanvon se ‘vikaas purush’ ke taur par aisa mekaover hua ki unhen ‘vikaas ke sabase bade chehre’ ke taur par pesh kiya jane laga
 Modi moved to the Center in 2014 after being the Chief Minister of Gujarat for nearly 12 and a half years
 gujarat vidhansabha kaa jo aakhri chunaav 2012 main hua tha wo modi kii aguai main ladaa gaya
 In such a situation, the Gujarat assembly elections in 2017 are being contested, this is the first time since 2002, when the BJP leadership is tempted without Modi in the state
 ye baat modi bhi acchhee tarah jaanate hai
 That is why this election has become a question of goodwill for them too
 isliye modi or unke master ranneetikaar amit shah gujarat main koi kasar nahin chhodana chaahate
 This is the reason why Modi will hold rallies for the promotion of Gujarat assembly elections
 jahaan tak mukhya vipakshi dal congress kii baat he to wo pichley 22 saal se gujarat main satta se baahar he
 With Modi being in power at the Center, the Congress hopes of returning to power in Gujarat on the strength of the contradictions of the Gujarat BJP leaders, anti-incumbency, the movements of the young trio of Hardik patel-alpesh thakor-jignesh Mevani
 Pali, the party knows that the modi-shah duo will not allow them to climb easily
 congress bhi saare raajnneetik napha-nuksaan kaa akalan karne ke baad hi chunavi chausar par puri saavdhaanee se apane daanv khel rahi he
 For almost two and a half decades, this election is in a 'do or die' situation for the marginalized Congress in Gujarat
 congress jaanati he ki is chunaav ke bhi vaise hi nattejey aae jaise ki 1995 ke baad se gujarat vidhansabha ke har chunaav ke aate rahe hai to congress ke rajya main vajood par hi sawalia nishaan lag jayega
 The proof of how the Congress is taking steps in Gujarat is that it does not want to send a message so that the BJP gets an opportunity to launch a 'hindu panchayat' of 'hindutva'
 khud ko ‘secularism’ kaa sabase bada alambardaar bataati ai congress munh se beshak naa kahe lekin gujarat main is baar ranneetik taur par ‘soft hindutv’ kii line pakade dikhaai de rahi he
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi started a roadshow in Saurashtra to play the election bugle and then presented the head in front of the Dwarkadhish
 phir chotila main maa chamunda ke darshan kiye
 In the second tour of central Gujarat, he visited the Santram temple, Bhatiji temple and took a bath
 sutron ke mutabik congress sochi-samajhi ranneeti ke tahat apane varisht netaa or rajyasabha saansad ahamed patel ko bhi gujarat ke is chunaav se dur dikhaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Everyone knows how Ahmed Patel won the recent Rajya Sabha election by demolishing all the fortifications of Amit Shah
 congress beshak ahamed patel ko gujarat vidhansabha chunaav se dur rakh rahi he, lekin gujarat ke mukhyamantri vijay roopaani ne surat main giraftaar hue do kathith aatankiyon ko lekar 27 oktober ko jo press conference kii, usamen ahamed patel kaa naam lekar jarur congress ko baikfoot par le jane kii koshish kii
 Rupani alleged that one of the two alleged terrorists arrested was an employee of the Sardar Patel Hospital in Ankleshwar, to which Ahmed Patel has been associated
 roopaani ne sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi se ahamed patel kaa istipha lene kii maang bhi kii
 Congress also had to come forward with Ahmed Patel to answer this bouncer from Rupani
 ahamed patel ne twit main kaha ki bijepi rashtriya suraksha ke mudde par raajnneeti nahin kare
 Also said that while fighting terrorism, BJP should not distribute to peace loving people of Gujarat
 congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne bhi ahamed patel kaa joardaar bachaav karte hue kaha ki jis aspataal kii baat bijepi kar rahi he, usase ahamed patel ne 2014 main hi istipha de diya tha
 After this, he had no connection with this hospital
 aise main agar koi kisi aarope main pakadaa jaataa he to uske liye saal 2014 ke aspataal ke trustee ko kaise jimmedaar tehraaya ja saktaa he
 It is the contrast of politics that the BJP has won the assembly elections of Gujarat in 2007 and 2012 riding on the kayak, the same 'development' is being strongly criticized on BJP in social media
 is sthiti ko bhunaane ke liye congress ne bhi puure ghode khol rakhe hai
 Along with the Patidar, OBC and Dalit cards, the Congress is also playing a soft Hindutva stance
 raajnneetik jaankaron ke mutabik 2002 ke baad bijepi kii gujarat main koshish yahi jataane kii rahi ki congress tushtikaran kii niti par chalate hue sirf alpsankhyakon, khaas taur par muslimon ke bare main hi sochati he or hinduon kii behatari ke bare main sochna uske agenda main nahin he
 Political experts say that by giving this message, in a way, this fear is shown to the majority, they should decide for whom the interest will work if the Congress comes back to power in Gujarat
 congress bhi is raajnneetik gunabhag ko samajhate hue apni ore se aisa koi kadam nahin uthaa rahi, jisase ki bijepi ko us par muslim tushtikaran kaa aarope laga kar prahaar karne kaa mauka mili
 The implications of Rahul Gandhi visiting Gujarat in temples can be understood
 rahul or congress kii gujarat main koshish soft hindutv kii line par chalakar us chhavi ko todane kii he jise bijepi ne uske liye gadha
 All the efforts of Rahul are also seen to have some benefit in changing the party's image in the youth
 gujarat ke kul votaron main se 60 fisadi 40 kii umr ke neeche hai
 The Congress also understands the importance of Patidar leader Hardik Patel, OBC leader Alpesh Thakor and Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani among the young voters of Gujarat
 isliye wo bijepi ke khilaaf aakrosh ko bhunaane ke liye is tikdi ko har haal main apane saath jode rakhana chaahati he
 Alpesh has joined the Congress itself, while Jignesh has spoken openly about the Congress support from the Dalit community
 haalanki patidaar netaa hardik patel ko sadhana congress ke liye bhi tedi kheer sabit ho rahi he
 Hardik has said bluntly that the Congress should clear by November 7 how it will give reservation to the Patidars
 agar aisa nahin kiya to uskaa bhi haal vahi hoga jaise ki surat main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke saath hua tha
 It is also necessary to mention here that a large section of the youth voters in Gujarat also belong to the youth who have seen the BJP rule in Gujarat in the last 22 years
 jis vikaas kii baat hameshaa narendra modi or bijepi kii ore se kii jaati rahi he, usee kii kaat main berogari, shiksha ke nijeekaran, sharabbandi ke baavjood sharaab kii avaidh bikri, karj ke boj kii vajah se kisaanon kii badahaali, fasal ke sahi daam naa milane jaise mudde jati kii raajnneeti karne vaale yuva netaaon kii ore se uthaae ja rahe hai
 And to a large extent, the words of these young leaders are also having an impact on their supporters
 dekhnaa hoga ki bijepi ke liye gujarat main uskaa janaa-parkhaa vikaas kaa mantra is vidhansabha chunaav main bhi kargar rahata he yaa nahin, jiske liye modi ko khud hi aage bad kar kahana pad rahaa he, ‘main vikaas hum, main gujarat hum
 Or the Congress is able to turn the electoral stream of Gujarat from the helm of soft Hindutva after 22 years with the young trio on its boat
 18 disambar ko gujarat main siyaasi oont kis karavat baithta he ye to philhal nahin kaha ja saktaa lekin ye saaf he ki nateeja jo bhi aayega wo 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii dasha or disha jarur kuch had tak tay karegaa
 There is a persistent deadlock in the monsoon session of Parliament
 congress party shuukravaar ko loksabhaa main mob linching kaa mudda uthaaegi
 The Congress says that the government is asleep on this issue, they should answer
 congress netaa mallikarjun khadge ne kaha ki ham is mudde par kaaphi lambey samay se bahes chaahate hai, lekin sarkaar jawaab nahin de rahi he
 Kharge said that we do not want to raise the issue of suspension of our 6 mps, we just want a debate on the issue of mob lynching
 bahes par hangaamaa karne vaale saansad hue the suspendsansad ke monsoon satr ke dauraan mob linching ke mudde par congress ne loksabhaa main hangaamaa kiya
 In the Lok Sabha, six Congress mps who have tossed paper towards Speaker Sumitra Mahajan have been suspended
 spikar ne gaurav gogoi, ke suresh, adheer ranjan, ranjit ranjan or sushmita dev ko 5 dinon ke liye suspend kiya he
 These mps were creating a ruckus to demand a discussion on mob lynching
 congress ne pesh kiya tha dogirapako bataa den ki isse pehle pichley saptaah bhi congress samet vipaksh ne is mudde par sansad main bahes kii thi
 The Congress presented a 40-page dossier in Parliament
 sansad main congress ke dwaara 40 pannon ke die gaye dogier par bijepi ne palatwaar kiya tha
 Sambit Patra said in a press conference that the separatists are not named in the dossier, the Congress simply wants to stall Parliament
 isamen ayub pandit ke mudde par bhi congress ne is dogier main koi zikr nahin kiya he
 Sambit Patra said that our government is not banning any film, but the Congress is trying to ban Indu government
 PM ne kai baar go rakshakon par bayaan diya he, phir bhi congress ise mudda bananaa chaahati he
