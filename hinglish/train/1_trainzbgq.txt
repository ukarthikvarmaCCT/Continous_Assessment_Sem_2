 AAP minister disputed commentary on ram-krishna, said, "mythology is mythical, not historical
 Rajendra Pal Gautam, a minister in the Delhi government, has made controversial remarks about Hindu deities
" unhone twit kar kaha ki agar yah baat pramanit he ki bhagwaan ram or krishna purvaj hai to inhen itihaas main kyon nahin padhaayaa jaataa
 The ancestors have a history, while they have no authentic history
 kejariwal sarkaar main mantri rajendra paal yaheen nahin ruke
 He said that these are mythological stories, not historical
 jabaki periyar kaa drushtikon pramanikta or taarkikta ke aadhaar par tha
 However, Aam Aadmi Party Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam deleted his tweet on Friday morning

 Rajendra Pal told the conspiracy Rajendra Pal said that i have not tweeted any, seeing the tweet, it seems that someone has done such mischief to harm our party during elections due to political malice
 unhone kaha ki hamaare liye sabhi dharm baraabar hai, ham sabhi dharmon kaa sammaan karte hai
 Somebody has misused or hacked my twitter handle and tweeted something on religious Icons to harm my party at the time of election, i will see the ways to take steps in this regards
 Everyone has right to have faith in their Icons and i respect everyone's faith
 - Rajendra Pal Gautam (@advrajendrapal) On November 22, 2019, AAP minister targeted BJP, Meenakshi Lekhi, leader of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said that things which are not read in books are studied in every household
 ram or krishna kan-kan main virajman hai
 He said that those who have written history do not believe in Lord Rama and Krishna like Aam Aadmi Party ministers, so they are not taught in books
 minaaksha lekhi ne kaha ki agar wo ye kah rahe hai ki unka twitor acount hack hua he to wo itnaa bataa den ki bhagwaan ram or krishna ko maanate hai yaa nahin
 Opposition parties are already trying to surround the Aam Aadmi Party ahead of the upcoming elections in Delhi

 Give some time to entertainment sibar city gurugram main chori kii vaaradaaten rukne kaa naam hi nahin le raheen
 With the increasing cold in winter, the incidents of theft are increasing and the police have completely failed to check this
 chori kii taaja vaardaat gurugram ke sector 15 main hui he, jahaan choron ne ek dukaan se lakhon kaa saamaan uda diya
 However, this entire theft incident has been captured in the CCTV camera installed in the shop and both the thieves have also come under the scanner
 police ne cese darj kar CCTV footage kii madad se choron kii talash shuru kar di he
 It can be seen in CCTV that thieves are very leisurely stealing
 yahaan gurugram ke sector 15 main bilkul main road par sthit dukaan ko choron ne nishaanaa banaaya
 Two thieves broke into the shop lock
 chori ke dauraan choron ke chehre par jaraa bhi dar najar nahin aa rahaa tha
 Both the thieves comfortably stole lakhs of precious mobiles from the shop and were shocked
 bataate chalem ki gurugram main atm kii lut se lekar dukaan auki gharon main ghuskar chori kii vaaradaaten lagaataar babbti ja rahi hai
 In recent times, the terror of criminals in Cyber city Gurugram has been increasing
 chori, chhina jhapati, lut, hatya or rape jaisi vaardaaton ko apradhi anjaam dete hai or bade hi aaraam se raffuchakkar ho jate hai
 In this case Gurugram police spokesperson Ravindra Kumar said that investigation of the case has been started on the basis of any TV footage and soon these thieves will be arrested and sent behind bars
 mumbai kii local trainon main automatic darwaazon ke saath logon ko surakshit yatra dene kii ummid pashchim railway ko he, lekin is ummid ke saamne 80 lakh logon kii bheed kii chunauti he
 The existing design of local trains has created decades old habits of passengers
 aaj tak khule darwaazon ke chalate log darvaaze main khadey ho kar safar yaa chalati train se chadhane-utarane ke aadi hai
 The Central and Western Railway Safety Commissioner in Mumbai says that Western Railway did not consult these doors before installing them
 mumbai kii local har halt par qareeb 30 second rukati he
 It takes about two and a half seconds for the automatic door to open, and the same time it takes for the door to close
 yani har stesan par 30 second ke halt main keval 25 second yatriyon ko chadhane-utarane milte hai
 These time consuming sounds can affect the crowd of people, and the goal of a train every third minute
 mumbai ke railway suraksha ayukta ne enditivi ko bataaya he, ki in darwaazon ko lagane se pehle railway ne unase mashvira nahin kiya
 Western Railway spokesperson Sharat Chandrayan told NDTV, 'it is not about the new train, we have improved the old train itself
 aise main yah baat suraksha ayog ke daayre main nahin aati
 ' lekin railway kii daleel kamazor isliye lagati he, kyonki suraksha ayog rail dibbon ke alaava railway ke anek pahaluon par gambhirthapurvak vichaar karata he
 These include cases such as the bridge over the tracks, the height of the platform
 swachaalit dibbon main ek badi kami he ki ve band hone se pehle waisi audio chetavanee nahin dete, jaisi agle stesan ke aane kii di jaati he
 In such a situation, the doors on which the Railways worked for four months, do not show them to the Security Commission, it does not seem small

 Attributed to the negligence of Lalit Kishore Jhalani, Chief Secretary to the Government of Rajasthan, Principal Secretary to Government, Alwar District Collector and Local Executive Engineer of PWD Department
 court room main maujuud mritak dow
 The 30-year-old son of Lalit Kishore Jhalani, Dr
 rishi kii ankhen apane pita ko yaad karte hue nam ho uthin
 He shares that feeling of his heart with India Today, "as soon as the judge gave the verdict, i thought - justice was finally found
 ladaai lambii rahi, lekin ladaai abhi or baaki he
 "what was the matter? In the backdrop of this historic decision, there is an incident on April 2, 2008 at Company Bagh in Alwar district, in which 56-year-old Dr
 jhalani kii maut ho gai thi
 As usual that day's eye dr
 jhalani apni patni pratibha jhalani or anya doctor doston ke saath alvar ke mashhoor company baag main subah kii saiyr kar rahe the
 Suddenly a large cast of dried peepal tree fell on the head of Jhalani

 Due to deteriorating condition, he was referred to Paras Hospital in Gurgaon
 magar ilaaj main deree kii vajah se dow
 Jhalani died the same day
 haadase ke vakt emdi kii padhai kar raheen or jhalani kii beti dow
 Mansi says, "the carelessness was such that the main gate of the park was closed that day and there were no guards
" isliye gambhir rup se ghayal pita ko park se baahar nikaalane main hi kareeb 45 minute kaa vakt lag gaya
 If there were no delays, perhaps they could have been saved
 ”faisle main kyaaise maamle main kareeb paanch saal kii ladaai ke baad alvar ke jila va seshan jaj kailash chandra sharma ne mana ki jhalani kii maut kii vajah sarkari karmchaariyon kii laaparvaahee he
 The district court, in its order, not only held the local Executive Engineer (XEN) responsible for the negligence in the maintenance of Company Bagh, but also the officials coming in the chain of governance, Alwar Collector, PWD Chief Governments Secretary and Chief Secretary for this negligence
 Pleaded guilty to being responsible

 But on the verdict Collector R
 es
 Seeking response from Jakhar, he says, "let the file come first, then we will comment
" hawa main chal rahi baton par tippanee nahin karenge
 Taking light of the news published on the information of this decision, he said that the news keeps on appearing in the media
 haalanki jab india today ne is faisle kii babat jaj kailash chandra sharma se baat kii to unhone niyamon kaa hawala dekar inkaar kar diya
 But he said, "our job was to give a decision, gave it away
" ”yah faisla dekhne-sunne main bhale kadaa lag rahaa ho, lekin is faisle main kisi adhikari ko nijee taur par jimmedaar tehraae jane kii bajaae pad ko doshi mana gaya he
 The compensation amount will also be paid from the treasury
 isliye is faisle kaa asar sarkari adhikariyon par tab tak nahin padane vaala, jab tak ki sarkaar sakhti na dikhaae
 If the government realizes the spirit of this decision and makes a policy to recover the compensation amount from the salary or pension of the immediate officers, then surely the rest of the bureaucracy will feel the responsibility
 jhalani parivaar ke vakil anil gupta or alvar main unke sahaayak vakil rajeshwar nand sharma kehete hai, ''is maamle main kisi vyakti ko nahin balki pad ko doshi mana gaya he, isliye ghatana ke vakt rahe adhikariyon ke kariyar par iskaa koi prabhaav nahin padegaa
 The district court, in its 11-page judgment, has considered in detail the negligence by dismissing all the pleas of the government
 sarkaar kii ore se adaalat main ped kii daal ke sukhi hone ko bhi jhuthalane kii koshish kii gai, ped ko haraa-bharaa bataaya
 But the victim proved on the basis of old reports that the administration showed negligence despite all the complaints

 The cause of Jhalani's death was stated
 jhalani parivaar ke vakil anil gupta kehete hai, ''hamane dow
 Jhalani's compensation was sought on the basis of income
 ab court ne sarkari laaparvaahee ko maan liya he lekin muaavje kii raashi badhaane ke liye ham upree adaalat main apil karenge
 "the government side termed the accident as an Act of God in the court, but Gupta says that the government side has not been able to produce any evidence to prove this argument
" alvar jila adaalat ke faisle ko upree adaalat main chunauti di ja sakati he, lekin yah faisla na sirf un sarkari adhikariyon-karmchaariyon ke liye khatre kii ghanti he jo jimmedaari se kaam karne kii bajaae din katate hai, balki desh ke un aam nagarikon ko bhi raah dikhaane vaala he jo aam taur par aisi ghatnaon ko mahaj haadasa yaa niyati maanakar chupchaap baith jate hai
 The Jhalani family too initially considered it a destiny, but suddenly they came to know that the tree which the tree gave Dr
 jhalani kii jindagi leel lee uske liye sarkaar kii laaparvaahee or akarmanyata jimmedaar he
 Mansi's anger erupts over this negligence
 "during the trial, sometimes it seemed that this could happen only in India because human life is given much importance in outside countries

 jiske baad akshay kumaar ne khud twit kar saaf kar diya ki unke paas canada kaa passport he
 After this tweet, social media became very active and all the discussions started on the pretext of citizenship of the actor

 In this film, he played the role of Indian Navy officer
 ye masalaa tab or bhi mahatvapurn ho jaataa he jab usee saal manoj bajpeyi ko film aligarh ke liye is aword kaa sabase tagada daavedaar mana gaya tha
 Apart from this, Vinayakan was also considered as a big contender for this award in the South Indian film Kamattipadam

 a senior film critic even went on to tweet that Talent has been sacrificed at the National Film Awards due to fake nationalism

 There were also rumors that Akshay won the award due to his close relationship with Priyadarshan

 If the jury or the ministry had made a mistake in Akshay's case, can this mistake be rectified? Yes, this is a very important question
 Are Canadian citizens eligible for India's National Awards? The year (2016) Akshay Kumar won 'best Actor', we were expecting Manoj Bajpayee to win for Aligarh
 If the jury / ministry has made an error in Kumar's case, will there be a revote ?? https: / / t

 ' There has been a political uproar over a letter written by the Aam Aadmi Party MP and Punjab in-charge Bhagwant Mann to the people of Punjab
 chitthee ko aam aadmi party ke kaaryakartaaon ke dwaara punjab ke logon ko door tu door campan ke tahat banti ja rahi he
 In this letter, Bhagwant Mann has described the achievements of the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi and has also kept an account of the work done in Sangrur, Punjab while being his MP
 is chitthee main bhagwant maan ne likhaa he ki unhone punjab ke liye apana acting or stand ap kamedi kaa profeshan bhi chhod diya or sharaab pine kii unhen jo lat thi wo bhi chhodkar ab unhone apana puraa jivan punjab ke logon ke liye samarpit kar diya he
 Opposition parties - the Akali Dal and the Congress - have raised objections about how Bhagwant Mann is telling the people of Punjab to give up his drinking habits
 inkaa kahana he ki agar bhagwant maan ne sharaab pinaa chhod diya to ye aam aadmi party yaa unki khud kii koi uplabdhi nahin he balki aisa bhagwant maan ne apni jeevanstyli or aadaton ko sudhaarney ke liye kiya he or isamen uplabdhi jaisi aakhirkaar kya baat he?
 Bhagwant Mann wrote in the second page of the first page of his letter that i was a famous artist earlier and used to take lakhs of rupees to do a show
 maine punjab ke logon kii seva karne ke liye apana kaam chhod diya
 i used to drink alcohol before but one day my mother told me that alcohol serves to stop the public service and you give up alcohol
 meri maa ke kehane se is saal 1 janvari se maine hameshaa ke liye sharaab pini chhod di or ab mere jivan kaa ek-ek minute punjab ke logon ke liye samarpit he
 After this, further in the letter, Bhagwant Mann's own and Arvind Kejriwal's achievements are telling the people how Arvind Kejriwal's government is working in Delhi and how they have worked as party mps and president of Punjab
 captain amarinder singh ko bhi is patr main gheraa gaya he
 The letter said that the promises he had made during the Punjab Assembly election campaign were no longer fulfilled when he formed the government
 haalanki chitthee main bhagwant maan dwaara sharaab chhod dene kii baat likhe jane ko lekar aam aadmi party ke netaaon ne unka bachaav kiya he
 Aman Arora, the leader of the Aam Aadmi Party and the chairman of the campaign committee of the Punjab, said that the opposition and the media are only interested in quitting the addiction of Bhagwant Mann while there are many other issues of Punjab which were written in this letter
 is
 aman aroda ne kaha ki bhagwant maan ne apane sharaab pine kii aadat ko chhod dene ke bare main isliye likhaa he taaki loksabhaa chunaav prachaar ke dauraan agar virdohi partiyaan bhagwant maan par sharaab pine or sharaab kaa aadi hone kaa aarope lagaaein to wo pehle se hi janata ko is par safai de rahe hai
 During this, Aman Arora said a controversial thing
 unhone kaha ki punjab main koun sharaab nahin peetaa, punjab main karodon sharaab kii bottle bikati hai or kya ye sari bottlen bhagwant maan hi pi jate hai lekin bevajaah bhagwant maan ke sharaab pine ko yaa sharaab chhod dene ko badha-chadhaakar virdohi partiyaan or media dwaara dikhaaya jaataa he
 On this, Akali Dal spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said that it is a matter of shame that Bhagwant Mann, while being a MP from Sangrur for 5 years, is telling the people of Punjab that he has given up the habit of alcohol instead of telling his work 
 dalajit singh cheema ne kaha ki darasal bhagwant maan or aam aadmi party ke paas punjab main bataane ko kuch bhi nahin he or isi vajah se bhagwant maan kii chhavi puure punjab main ek sharaabi netaa kii ban chuki he isliye wo apni sharaab kii lat chhodane kii baat ko baar-baar janata ke bich main doharaa rahe hai
 Cabinet minister and Congress leader in the Punjab government, Sadhu Singh Dharmasot, said that the Aam Aadmi Party and its leaders feel that this is the only achievement that they have released Bhagwant Mann's alcohol addiction and Bhagwant Mann should be ashamed that he The public has to be clarified repeatedly about the habit and instead of raising issues related to the public and telling them, Bhagwant Mann repeatedly gives clarification on his drinking habits
 The people live
 bhagwant maan kaa kahana he ki isamen buraai hi kya he
 When i have said this in a huge public meeting, what can be the harm in writing in the letter
 tab kisi ne naa suna ho yaa kisi ko naa pataa laga ho or main tab party kaa adhyaksh bhi nahin tha isliye ab yah baat chitthee main doharaai gai he

 kanhaiya kumaar, arvind kejariwal, narendra modi, anna hajaare or in sab ke bich kahin hardik patel
 In the past five and a half years, these five people not only became discussion-a-common, but also earned a name and then either collapsed in front of the expectations of one hundred and fifty crore, or now they are ahead of the deadline to meet it with expectations Are getting foggy
 jabaki kashmir se kanyakumari or uttarpurv se dakshin-pashchim tak aas abhi bhi baaki he
 Now, remember those two scenes of the silver screen world
 ek film 'nayak' kaa jahaan anil kapur ko ek din kaa mukhyamantri banaaya jaataa he or raaton-raat system ko sudhaar diya jaataa he
 The scene of the second film 'rajneeti' where Naseeruddin Shah shouts in front of the stage of power, says, 'ye pat ki mari janta hai rai sahib
 ek roti kaa aasraa de dijie, do mithe vaade kar dijie, kisi bhi rang kaa jhanda uthaa legi
 'that is to say, from Tokenhaiya Kumar to Hardik Patel via Narendra Modi, the flag of the flag (except the tricolor) flying behind each name is different
 lekin yah cinema nahin he, lihaaja maujuuda vakt main sava sau karod kii bhukh roti se aage badhkar yaa to daal kii he yaa phir ek aisa netaa ki jo unki aakankshaon, sapanom or aas ko puraa kar sake
 Perhaps this is the reason that along with the color of the flag, the issues behind these five names have also been different
 desh ko mudda nahin 'netaa' chahieazadee ke 68 saal baad loksabhaa se lekar har rajya kii vidhansabha main netaaon or mananeeyon kii sankhya main lagaataar ijapha hua he
 There is no shortage of the strength of leaders at the local level as well
 lekin ye durbhaagya hi he ki in sab ke baavjood janata aaj bhi apane ke liye aawaaj uthaane vaale 'nayak' kii talash main he
 Perhaps this is why issues of character and moves have become secondary
 kyonki tabhi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf aawaaj buland karke anna hajaare or arvind kejariwal kaa udai hua to kalaadhan or garibi ke bal par narendra modi kaa
 Hardik Patel became a hero by demanding reservation for a particular community, and the anti-national debate made Kanhaiya a 'hero' overnight
 naa naa karte
 
 
 Rajneetiyeh is also a strange coincidence that everyone from these five have called politics 'no' in their early days
 jabaki inamen se do (kejariwal or modi) jahaan phul-flavod raajnneeti kaa hissaa hai, vahiin do (kanhaiya or hardik) philhal raajnneeti se parhez kii baat kar rahe hai
 While talking about the president of the students' union or the fight for a particular community, both are doing the same
 yani maujuuda halaat or pichley udaahranon ko dekhakar do baaten samaj main aati hai
 First of all, every person who talks about change has to come to politics and secondly, when you talk about society and community, then you fall in love with politics even when you are not
 beete paanch varshon main kya mila, kya sikhaapichley paanch varshon kii baat karen to desh ke sava sau karod logon ko jis ek 'nayak' kii bhukh he, uski talash main kai chehre saamne to aae, lekin tripti nahin mili yah tay he
 Because this is why everyone from social media to the road today is looking for the possibility behind every person who talks about change
 lekin afsos kii apekshaaon ke boj tale koi bhi instant upaay nikaal nahin paaya
 While the country is so traumatized by the situation and system in the last 68 years, it should also be relaxed
 bilkul 'nayak' film kii tarah
 Now what next 
 
 bhukh abhi bhi he
 The search is on
 puraane vikalp dharashaayi ho rahe hai! bhavishya se ummiden bhi hai
 But at present, it is also important for the common citizen to change the habit of instant remedy and desire
 yani dhairya
 This patience should be seen everywhere from the election of the leader to the opinion formed

 unhone kaha ki bihar main pichley varsh sona bechney ke maamle main ek number par patna jipio, duusare number par bankipur or tisare number par bhagalpur daakghar rahe
 In view of the increasing demand for gold in Bihar, from the current financial year, its sale is being started at seven other post offices in the state, Farbisganj, Jogbani, Sonpur, Shivhar, Dalsingh Sarai, Ekma and Mashrak

 The Indore police has registered a case of rape against a 55-year-old man allegedly with his daughter-in-law

 The Guna police has referred the case to the Lasudia police station for investigation
 unhone mahila kii shikaayat ke hawaale se bataaya ki guna se vivaah kar indore ai navvivaahita ko uskaa pati pansad nahin karata tha
 The husband allegedly started raping her several times since November 2013, in the absence of other members of the house, on the pretext of special puja for her
 ranavat ne bataaya ki sasur kii harkaton se tang aakar peedita apane maayke guna chali gai or vahaan kotwali police thane main sasur ke khilaaf rape kaa maamla darj karaayaa

 But Anna also appeared with Kejriwal on the posters being waved in Farrukhabad
 ab sawaal he ki poster par anna kii maujuudagi kaa matlab kya he
 The Anna Hazare whom Arvind Kejriwal considers his mentor and guide is in his village Ralegan Siddhi, about 1400 km from Anna Farrukhabad
 us anna ne khud ko kejariwal ke siyaasi hunkaar or ghamaasan se bhale hi maheenon pehle khud ko dur kar liya he, lekin kejariwal ke samarthakon ne poster par is duuri ko paat diya he
 Anna's picture has been affixed with Kejriwal on the poster of India Against Corruption
 farrukhabad kii tarah hi kanpur main bhi aise poster mili, jisamen anna or kejariwal ek saath dikhaai pad rahe hai
 These posters are staggering because at the time when Kejriwal had announced to form his political party, Anna had also announced his distance from Kejriwal & Party
 anna ne do took ye kah diya tha ki kejariwal kii raajnneeti main unki tasviir tak kaa bhi istemaal nahin hoga
 Anna may want to keep herself away from politics
 lekin apane peeche khadey majame ke baavjood kejariwal ko yahi lagata he ki bagaiyr anna ke siyaasi naiya paar lagaana bhi aasaan nahin hoga

 @artipoppea post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on Jul 8, 2017 at 8:36 am pdtzack Lalvani born 17th May 2017A post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on May 19, 2017 at 3:00 pm PDT vaise to sabhi mata-pita ke liye apane bachche ko janm dena ek saubhaahgya kii baat hoti he
 At the same time, some parents believe in living with only one child, given their financial condition and health
 lekin duusare bachche ko lekar parivaar kaa pressure hone ke kaaran kuch log duusare bachche kii planning karne lagate hai
 For this reason, they often forget that there should be a difference in the birth of their children
 haalanki bacchon ko janm dena yaa unke liye plan karnaa sabhi mata-pita kaa nijee maamla hota he
 But keeping in mind the health of mother and child, it is very important to keep some things in mind
 aaj ham aapako bataane ja rahe hai ki do bacchon ke janm main kitna antar hona chahie or kyon?aapako doosraa baccha kab chahie, ye to aap par hi nirbhar karata he
 But before planning another child, keep in mind the health of the mother
 jab mahila pehle bachche ko janm dene ke baad puri tarah se swasth ho jaae tabhi unhen duusare bachche ke liye sochna chahie
 However, there are some advantages and some disadvantages of having more or less difference in the second child
 pehle or duusare bachche main 12 se 18 maheene kaa antar hone se unke bich gaharaa sambandh hota he
 But the small difference between the two children can affect the health of the mother
 darasal, donon bacchon ko saath breast feeding karana, raat bhar unke saath jaage rahanaa, do bacchon kii jimmedaari ek saath uthaanaa maa kii sehat par bura asar daalati he
 According to one study, the difference between the first and second child is at least 18 months
 kyonki kam antar hone ke kaaran duusare bachche kii pre-maior delivery hone ke saath bachche kaa vajan bhi kam hone kaa khatra rahata he
 According to the health expert, there should be a difference of about 2 years between the birth of the first and second child
 unka kahana he ki 2 do bacchon ke bich do saal kaa antar hone se maa or baccha donon kii sehat acchhee rahati he
 If there is a difference of 3 years in the birth of two children then the first child starts to be a little smarter
 saath hi bachche ko janm dene or breast feeding karaane ke baad maa ke sharir main ai kamajori bhi us samay tak bilkul thik ho jaati he
 Apart from this, due to the difference in the age of children, parents are able to raise both children correctly
 world health orgenigeshan (WHO) ke mutabik, pehle or duusare bachche ke janm main lagbhag 24 maheene kaa antar hona behad jaruri hota he
 Because in 24 months the health of the woman improves completely
 agar aap 24 maheene se pehle hi duusare bachche ko janm dena chaahate hai to kam se kam do bacchon ke janm main 18 maheene kaa antar jarur rakhen
 But the health expert also says that due to a difference of three or more in the birth of another child, there may be some problems in pregnancy and birth of another child

 '' bhale hi pulavama hamale kii jimmedaari jaish ne lee ho, lekin kashmir main is sabase bade aatanki hamale kaa asli mastermind to khud pakistan he
 Terrorists like Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar play on his lap
 pakistan bhale hi pulavama aatanki hamale se apana haath khinch rahaa ho, lekin ye koi pehali baar to he nahin jab pakistan ne apane kiye-karaae par pardaa daalane kii besharm koshish kii ho, lekin pakistan ke har jhooth ko benakaab karne ke liye uske aatankwaadi hi kaaphi hai, jinhone pulavama aatanki hamale se ek hafte pehle hi pakistan ko benakaab kar diya tha
 It is only on February 5
 jab lahore kii sadakon par aatankwaadiyon ke sailaab ke bich pakistan kaa most faverd aatankwaadi hafiz said hindustan main aatankwaadi hamalon kii dhamkee de rahaa tha
 Hafiz Saeed said that you should tell me
 kya tum kashmiriyon ke kaam aane ko taiyaar ho
 shoulder to shoulder
 
 Be ready to match step by step
 kashmiriyon ko hafiz said se koi gilaa nahin
 Listen to Kashmiris
 ham tumhaare saath he
 We are ready to go to Srinagar
 paracham ko srinagar main lahraane ke liye taiyaar hai
 At the time, Hafiz Saeed in Lahore was threatening a terrorist attack in Kashmir
 thik usee vakt par jaish-e-mohammad kaa sargana or masood ajahar kaa chota betaa rauf asagar, afjal guru ke naam par aatmghaatee daste banane kaa elaan kar rahaa tha
 Rauf Asghar had said that you listen
 
 Now the war of Kashmir will be fought from the mountains of Kashmir
 
 There was a burden on the head
 afjal guru shahid
 Had to settle the account
 afjal guru kaa intkaam lekar dikhaaya
 
 aisa lekar dikhaaya ki dushman ko maananaa padaa
 Listen up kashmir kii jang kashmir ke pahaado se nikalakar ladi jaaegi
 Decisions in Delhi will be answered to you in Delhi
 hafiz said kii raily or rauf asagar kii boli
 This is the proof of this
 
 The biggest terrorist attack in Pulwama so far was on the instigation of Pakistan
 iske baad pakistan ke aatankvami khemon se lekar pakistani fouj or iesai ke khemon main jashn manaane kii hode much gai
 Former Chief of ISI Le
 general (ritred) amjad shueb ne kaha ki noujvaan nasl kii soch bahut alag hoti he ham jaise logon se
 
 jo jindagi guzaar ke
 
 jazabbaat thande pad chuke hai
 
 ye process abhi shuru nahin hua he jise ham suicide bombing kehete hai
 
 ye shuru hona he
 
 jab kashmiri noujvaan ko ye samaj lag gai ki use vaise hi unke haathon maaraa janaa he
 
 to kuch markar use marane vaala karke dikhayega
 
 hindustan ko bhi hosh ke nakhun unhone nahin liye
 These are former chief of Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI, Amjad Shueb
 jinka dil pulavama aatanki hamale main bharat ke javaanon kii shahadat par balliyon uchhal rahaa he or ho bhi kyon naa, kyonki bhale hi pulavama main hamalaa jaish kii karatuut thi, lekin aadesh to ISI or pakistani fouj kaa tha
 Because the world knows that even the biggest terrorist for the world
 pakistani fouj or ISI kii marji ke bina itane bade hamale ko anjaam tak nahin pahunchaa saktaa
 - The announcement of jaish-e-mohammed kingpin Rauf Asgar to form a suicide squad of terrorists in the name of Afzal Guru at a rally in Karachi
 - lahore kii sadakon par aatankwaadi jamaaton ke bich khadey hokar jamaat-ud-daawa ke top aatankwaadi hafiz said kaa hindustan par hamale karne kii dhamkiyaan dena
 - Two days after these terrorist rallies in Pakistan, security agencies in India issued an alert for suicide terror attack
 - or phir ek hafte ke andar andar kashmir main abtak kaa sabase bada aatankwaadi hamalaa ho janaa
 This cannot be a coincidence at all
 lekin pakistan kii besharmi kaa alam ye he ki wo hindustan se saboot maang rahaa he
 If Pakistan wants proof, then it should just dare to peek into its Gireban, because from India it no longer has proof
 sirf sabak milegaa
 This is also discussed in Pakistani media
 pakistan media main vahaan ke jaankaron kaa kahana he ki kartarpur kii baat hui thi to india ne kaha tha ki hafiz said ko hamaare hawaale karen
 
 unki demand bilkul thik he
 
 india kaa nahin

 Masood Azhar is also wanted
 
 This is all that is

 Indian Internal Security Specialist Jaydev Ranade said that lying and raising terrorists
 pakistan kii utani hi puraani aadaten hai
 As much as Pakistan itself

 No matter how much Pakistan denies its hand in the Pulwama attack, its denial will not change the truth

 yah notice kisi vyakti kaa pataa lagane ke liye jari kiya jaataa he
 According to Interpol's website, "this (diffusion) is less formal than a notice, but it is used to locate a person's arrest or whereabouts in connection with a police investigation or to obtain additional related information

 Last summer, the Indian team, which was badly knocked out in the Test and ODI series at the hands of England, has a good chance of accounting for the previous defeat of the English team
 donon timen hyderabad ke kareeb uppal main sthit rajeev gandhi antarrashtriya cricket stadium main shuukravaar ko paanch maichon kii shrinkhalaa kaa pehla muqabla khelengi
 This match will decide whether the Indian team has learned some lessons from the previous defeat
 yaa phir uske khilaadiyon par 'thakaan' ab bhi haaavee he
 Many key players are still out of the team but many have got rest in the past
 isse yah aashaa kii ja sakati he ki bhartiya khilaadi thakaan kaa bahaanaa chhodkar apana shreshth pradarshan karenge
 The English team had beaten India 4–0 in four Tests and 3–0 in five odis in the previous series
 yahi nahin, bharat ko ekmaatr twanti-20 match me bhi haar mili thi
 In that series, India had lost the crown of the highest seeded Test team and suffered a lot of embarrassment as the world champions

 shuruyaat ke do maichon ke liye sachin or sahvaag ke alaava jahir khan, yuvaraj singh, rohit sharma, munaf patel or ishanth sharma team kaa hissaa nahin hai
 In such a situation, the Indian bowling will mainly depend on players like Praveen Kumar, Vinay Kumar, Umesh Yadav, Aaron, Ravichandran Ashwin and Rahul
 jahaan tak ballebaaji kii baat he to bharat ke paas captain mahendra singh dhoni ke alaava gautam gambheer, parthiv patel, ajinkya rehane, virot kohli, suresh raina or rabindra jadeja jaise achche khilaadi hai, jinaki badaulat bhartiya team gharelu halaat main jeetne kaa dam rakhti he
 Through this series, the Indian team has a good chance to overtake England in the ICC ODI teams rankings

 This lovely (she talks about love for India) name of Pakistani actress - Mahira Khan
 or film he- rais, jisamen abhinayta shahrukh khan bhi hai
 One of the reasons behind Mahira not coming to India is the silence of the Government of India and the Ministry of External Affairs
 duusari pramukh vajah he- kuch ativaadee takaton kii apni raajnneeti
 In such a situation, should the Foreign Minister of the Government of India, Sushma Swaraj, not answer some questions related to 'india cannot come to Mahira'? Actually, the protest of Pakistani artists from other organizations including Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) last year Pakistan actors had to leave the country after it happened
 shahrukh khan ne dabaav main disambar main yah tay kiya tha ki ve mahiraa ko pramotion ke liye bharat nahin bulaayenge or aage pakistani kalakaaron ke saath kabhi kaam nahin karenge
 In an interview to BBC Urdu recently, Mahira has expressed sorrow over not coming to India and said that she wishes she could come! 10 questions to India's Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj: 1
 agar bharat sarkaar ne pakistaniyon ko vija dene sambandhi niyamon main parivartan nahin kiya he to kyon nahin ek pakistani ko bharat aane ke liye hausala bhi diya jaae? ek aam pakistani yaa kalakaar ko bharat aane se rokane se bharat ko kya hasil hoga?2
 a lovely person who has worked in India legitimately for two years, if he wants to come back to the country for the same work, will he get full support from the government, complete security and similar environment? 3
 jab kuch ativaadee takaton ne pakistani kalakaaron ko desh se bhagane kii baat uthaai to kya videsh mantralay usee vakt unke saath majbootee se khadaa tha?4
 If a well-known artist who wants to come to India, could not come, would it not damage the image of the country in the world? Do you care about it? 5
 auraton ke liye doum darje vaale or ek pakistani samaaj se nikalakar jis mahila ne safalataa kii lambii ladaai ladi ho
 Should the biggest democratic country be seen closing its doors? 6
 kya videshiyon ke bharat main rojgaar karne se desh ko laabh nahin hota?7
 Is it not the responsibility of the Ministry of External Affairs to make foreigners feel safe and free in India under any circumstances? 8
 beete vakt main jab videshiyon ko lekar kuch ativaadee takatein bhavanaaen bhadakaane kaa kaam kar rahe the, videsh mantralay ne maahaul sudhaarney ke liye kya-kya kadam uthaae?9
 As a cabinet minister, was this issue discussed with other ministries such as the Home Ministry or the state governments? 10
 ek 'nijee sawaal'
 Since Shah Rukh Khan is currently not able to call Mahira to Mumbai
 kya sushamaa swaraj nijee taur par mahiraa khan ko dilli main invite karne par vichaar karengi?(artical main uthaae gaye sawaal lekhak kii nijee raay he

 He targeted Johnson and see what happened in Adelaide

 vah jo kahata he mujhe usase dikkat nahin he
 He is good enough to be an Australian

 According to the details issued in response to an RTI application from the Railways, the department has earned Rs 35,073 crore from junk in the last 10 years
 isamen coach, vaighans or patari ke kabad shaamil hai
 In the details given by the Railway Board under Right to Information to social worker Jinendra Surana of Madhya Pradesh, it has been said that in the last 10 years, the most junk was sold in the year 2011-12
 is kabad se railway ko 4,409 karod rupee kii aamadani hui
 At the same time, the revenue from the lowest junk in the year 2016-17 was Rs 2,718 crore
 rail patariyon kaa kabad sabase zyadarailvay board kii taraf se di gai jaankaree main bataaya gaya he ki beche gaye kabad main sabase badi hissedari rail patariyon kii he
 Between the years 2009-10 to 2013-14, railway tracks worth Rs 6,885 crore were sold
 vahiin saal 2015-16 se 2018-19 kii avadhi ke bich 5,053 karod rupee kii kabad ho chuke railway patari bech die gaye

 The Prime Minister said that the solution to the issue of Jammu and Kashmir will be found only by the formula of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 khaas intervyuu main 'ajtak' kii Executive Editor shweta singh se baat karte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha ki kashmir mudde kaa hal kaise nikalegaa hamen pehle se pataa tha, satta main rahane kii jarurat nahin thi
 i worked there as a worker, i have lived in every district of Kashmir
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki ek mutthi bhar pariwaron ne jammu-kashmir kii janata ko imotional blackmel karne kaa kaam kiya he, jab mufti sahab the to hamen laga ki isse waapas aaenge
 But that was our great depression, we had said earlier that it was an oil and water issue
 piem bole ki janata ne aisa sandesh diya tha ki koi or chaara nahin tha, loktantr kaa takaza aayaa to hamane ise chhod diya
 Only Atal ji's formula will run there 'insaniyat-kashmiriyat-jamurit'

 In the state of Madhya Pradesh, the Muslim minority is not in a decisive role like in states like Uttar Pradesh, Assam and Bengal
 baavjood iske congress-bijepi donon dalon kii nazren inke voton par he
 This is the reason why Kikangress Adhyakshahul Gandhimoti is going to the mosque and asking for vows
 vahiin, rajya main lagaataar chauthi baar camel khilaane ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi bohara muslimon ke aage sajadaa kar rahe hai
 Eight percent of Muslim voters in the state are about 8 percent Muslims
 rajya main kareeb do darjan vidhansabha siten muslim bahul hai
 Apart from this, the Muslim vote is in a decisive role in a dozen seats
 baavjood iske rajya main vidhansabha ke 230 vidhayakon main sirf ek hi muslim vidhayak he
 The Muslim electorate was generally considered a supporter of the Congress, but when the politics of non-congressism started in 1967 and the Muslims also saw an alternative to the Congress in the opposition, it started changing its stance
 haalankimadhya pradeshmen muslim matadaata congress kaa saath nahin chhod sakaa
 Shadab Salim, an advocate from Indore, says that in Madhya Pradesh, there is no alternative to Muslims other than the Congress
 isiilie muslim na chaahate hue bhi congress ko vot dene ke majaboor hai
 However, there is not much difference between Congress and BJP
 pradesh kaa bohara samaaj bijepi ke saath he
 Secular image of Shivraj Tell that the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan has tried to create a secular image
 shivaraj id ke din muslim topi pahanakar musalamaanon ko gale lagaate hai, ramadan maheene main apane ghar par musalamaanon ko iftaar kii daavat bhi dete hai
 On the basis of Shivraj's image, BJP has been getting about 15 percent of the votes of Muslims
 shivaraj sarkaar ne bhopal main haj house, urdu vishvavidhyalay ke liye zamin aanvaton, muslim ladakiyon ko mukhyamantri kanyadan yojana kaa laabh dena, hazaaron muslim buzurgon ko tirth darshan yojana ke antargat ajmer sharif kii yatra shuru karai he
 'with the Congress in Muslim compulsion', Shadab Salim has voted for BJP in MP, a large section of Muslims due to Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 iske peeche ek vajah ye bhi rahi ki congress kabhi jitati hui nahin dikh rahi thi
 Congress seems to be contesting the first election in the last 15 years
 iske alaava mob linchig jaisi ghatnaon ne musalamaanon ko congress kii ore jhukne ko phir se majaboor kar diya he
 Muslim vote not kingmaker in Madhya Pradesh: Political analyst Hidayatullah Khan says that Muslim voters in Madhya Pradesh are not in the role of kingmaker like other states
 haalanki kuch site jarur hai, jahaan wo nirnayak bhoomika adaa karte hai
 Barring Bhopal and Burhan seats, there is no other seat where they can win with their votes
 unhone kaha ki musalamaanon ke bijepi ke saath hone kii koi sambhaavna nahin he
 Muslims see the face of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, not of Shivraj in BJP
 bhopal se alag aawaaj aati he or dilli se kuch or
 In such a situation, BJP used to get votes on the face of Shivraj
 is baar wo bhi milanaa mushkil he
 The Muslim majority seat has a Muslim population of over 1 lakh in 19 districts out of the 51 districts of the state
 bhopal main sankhya bal ke aadhaar par sabase zyada muslim matadaata he
 While in percentage, Burhanpur has the highest
 bhopal uttar vidhansabha seat par sabase zyada 60 fisadi or burhanpur seat par 50 fisadi muslim matadaata he
 Indore-1, Indore-3, Bhopal Madhya, Ujjain and Jabalpur seats have more than 30 percent Muslim voters
 khandwa, ratlam, jaavara or gwalior seat par 20 se 25 fisadi ke bich muslim matadaata he
 Shajapur, Mandla, Neemuch, Mahidpur, Mandsaur, Indore-5, Nasrullaganj, Ichhawar, Ashta and Ujjain South seats have 16 percent voters
 MP main muslim pratinidhtvamadhya pradesh main pichley 15 saal se aarif akil eklaute vidhansabha pahunchane vaale vidhayak hai
 As a Congress candidate, he is continuously winning
 jabaki 1962 main sabase zyada saat muslim vidhayak bane the
 Since then, Muslim representation has steadily declined
 1972 main 6, 1957-1985 or 1998 main 5-5 or 1967, 1977 or 1990 main 3-3 muslim vidhayak rahe
 In 1985 and 1990, one Muslim candidate won the assembly on the BJP ticket
 bijepi se muslim rah chuke vidhayakabata den ki madhya pradesh main 1985 or 1990 main bijepi ke tikat par bhi muslim pratyaashee jeet hasil kar chuke hai
 After this, in 1993, BJP had made Gani Ansari the candidate, but he could not save his bail

 Sydney is fond of long necks
 sidney par apni gardan lambii karne kaa junun savaar ho gaya he
 She wants to look like the Padoung women of the Kayan tribe of Myanmar
 philhal sidney kii gardan kii lambaai 5 inch he, vah ise 8 inch or badhanaa chaahati he
 a neck more than 1 inch or 13 feet long seems an unnatural act, but this is what is called passion
 apane is junun ko anjaam tak pahunchane ke liye sidney gale main pital ke challe pahenti hai
 So far, she has spent more than $ 1000 or 61 thousand rupees in making these rings
 vah hameshaa gale main pital ke challe pahane rahati hai, yahaan tak ki vah sote samay bhi in chhallon ko nahin utaaratin
 She uses baby wipes to clean these rings
 sidney saal main do baar nae challe pahenti he or vartmaan main unke gale main kul 16 challe hai
 Due to these, he also has problems in turning the neck, driving and eating food
 lekin kehete hai naa ‘shauk badi cheez he’, is shauk ke liye wo in pareshaaniyon ko bhi hansate-hansate jhel leti hai
 Doctors advise that he should get these rings removed, as this can have a bad effect on his health
 lekin sidney aisa karne ke liye bilkul bhi taiyaar nahi hai
 He has agreed to not wear any new ring in the coming 5 years, but the passion to lengthen the neck remains intact
 ye bhi kam ajeeb shauk nahinaisa bhi nahin he ki ajeeb tarah ke shauk rakhane vaali sidney akeli hai

 orthopedic plaster karne ke liye doctoron ke bhi paseene chhot jate hai, lekin kevin khud apane aap hi plaster kar lete hai
 They believe that plasters give them a high position in society
 kevin kaa kahana he ki jab vah 12 saal ke the tab unka haath tutaa tha, tabhi se unhen plaster karke rahane kaa junun savaar he
 When he was 6-7 years old, he used to steal the toilet roll and wrap it on his leg
