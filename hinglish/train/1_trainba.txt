 His character was well liked
 kehete to yah bhi hai ki mahabharat main nitish kii chhavi vaale poster bhagwaan shrikrishna ke rup main puuje jane lage the
 The actor came to be known as Shri Krishna
 nitish ke is ekmaatr role ne unki jindagi badal di
 He gained popularity like a star and became a child of the country

 The actor's popularity was also redeemed by the Bharatiya Janata Party
 shrikrishna ke role se wo itane femes hue ki 1996 main unhen bijepi ne jamshedpur se loksabhaa kaa tikat diya
 Nitish also won the election and became an MP
 haalanki, kuch samay baad unhone politics chhod di
 In an interview given to Aaj Tak, on coming back to politics again, he said - not for the next fifty years, because i learned that what i wanted to do through politics, i can do it through films too

 gaur karen to mahabharat ke baad nitish ko lagbhag ek jaise dharmik rolls mili
 Among these, many serials like Vishnu Purana and Ramayana were included
 jis role ne nitish ko ghar-ghar main pahchaan di, uski vajah se actor kaa kariyar ek dharre ke kirdaaron main simatata najar aayaa
 Although Nitish's few films came in between, but he did not get any special status on the big screen
 philhal pichley kuch saalon se nitish acting main sakriy bhoomika nibhaate najar aa rahe hai

 ram rahim ke jail main jane ke baad uski kaali karatuuton se ek ke baad ek pardaa uthta ja rahaa he
 So far many sadhvis have accused rapist Baba Ram Rahim of rape
 'ajtak' ne ek aisi hi sadhvi ko dhund nikaala he, jisane dere main rahete hue ram rahim kii gupha main hone vaale sadhviyon ke yon shoshan ko dekha
 Not only this, she herself survived being a victim of Baba
 usne bataaya ki ram rahim ek khaas jam pilaakar ladakiyon ko vash main kar letaa tha
 The Sadhvi we are telling you about, she lived in the ashram of the Sadhvis of Gurmeet Ram Rahim's Dera Sacha Sauda from 1999 to 2002
 usne apana naam or pahchaan gupt rakhane kii shart par 'ajtak' ko apni aapbeetee bataai
 Read the entire conversation
 
 
 sawaal - aap kab se kab tak dere main rahi or dere main jaakar rahane ke peeche kya vajah thi?jawaab - main 1999 se lekar 2002 tak dere main rahi
 After that i did not stay there
 maine apane mata-pita ko bhi bataaya ki dere main ye galat kaam hote hai, lekin mere mata-pita ne kaha ki vahaan par aisa kuch nahin hota
 Told us to stay on the camp
 sawaal - aapke mata pita ne aapako dere main kyon bheja tha?jawaab - hamaare maa baap ne kaha tha ki vahaan par aap rahoge seva karoge, dharmik kaam karoge or padhai bhi karoge
 On going there, my duty was placed around the cave
 gupha ke andar ladakiyon ko bulaayaa jaataa tha or kaha jaataa tha ki tumhen maafee milegi, lekin jab ladkiyaan baahar aati thi to wo rote hue aati thi
 When we used to ask girls, she would not tell anything
 maine ek baar ek ladki par kaaphi dabaav daalaa to usne sab bataaya
 But all of us parents did not believe this
 jab sadhviyon kii likhit chitthiyaan saamne ai tab ham main se kuch ladakiyon ko maa-baap ne waapas ghar bula liya
 On coming home, we told our parents that everything happens in the cave
 gupha main ek jam pilaayaa jaataa tha or uske baad ye sab kuch hota tha
 We also heard many shouting and screaming sounds from the cave
 gupha ke chaaron ore commando or kuch police vaale bhi baba ne rakhe hue the or vahaan par purushon ke saath-saath sadhviyon ko bhi daraa-dhamka kar rakhaa jaataa tha
 Dad used to scare everyone
 ek sadhvi ke bhai kii hatya bhi kar di gai thi isi vajah se tamaam ladkiyaan behad hi dar gai thi
 The girls were called to the cave at 11 o'clock at night and the girl they liked was called
 ladki andar chali to jaati thi lekin baahar aane par majaburi kii vajah se koi bhi ladki kuch nahin bolti thi
 Everyone did not know what was heard here and there, but when two sadhis wrote letters and told everyone, after that, our spirits too increased
 sawaal- aapane bataaya ki aap 1999 se 2002 tak vahaan rahi he, to is dauraan aapane kya dekha ki ladakiyon ke saath kya hota tha or kya aapke saath bhi kabhi kuch aisa karne kii koshish kii gai?jawaab- mujhe bhi bulaayaa tha or kahaan gaya tha ki pitaaji ne maafee deni he or or main andar chali bhi gai thi
 But when i got to know everything when i went inside, i came out somehow
 sawaal- jam pine se kya hota tha?jawaab- wo pine ke baad sab unheen ke ho jate the or duusari taraf koi nahin ja paata tha
 Used to live only through father
 sawaal - aap ab tak chup kyon thim?jawaab - ham isliye chup rahe ki kahin ye hamaare kisi parivaar vaale ko maar naa de
 We will keep someone silent, that's why we kept quiet
 parivaar hamaara sukhi thik tha isi vajah se ham chup rahanaa hi thik samajhate the, lekin jab in ladakiyon ne thodi awaz uthaai to ham baahar aa gaye
 Question - When the letters came out in 2002, did your parents agree with you? Answer - Yes, then our parents agreed to us
 muslim tushtikaran kii tohamat jhelane kii baat khud congress ke haar ke kaarnon kii jaanch karne vaali antony samiti ne maani thi
 Therefore, Rahul and Congress Gahega do not leave any chance to change their image
 ab 6 sitambar se upi mishan 2017 kaa aagaaj karne ja rahe rahul ne nai ranneeti or nae andaaj ke saath siyaasi ran main utarane kii taiyaari kii he
 As a warrior prepares to receive the war as soon as he comes in the political war, as soon as Rudrapur comes to the earth, as soon as Rahul comes in front of the public, firstly Ranbheri will be played on the high loft on both sides of the road, playing drums and naked
 rahul aage badhenge, to aage-aage parmparik andaaz main ghode chalenge, phir uske peeche aaj ke daur kaa vaahan yaneepatafatiyaanhongi
 Then Rahul will move forward in his farmer chariot
 kul milakar najaara aisa ki, maano koi yoddha yuddh main nikal padaa ho
 The temple of Nath Baba of Rahularrudpur is a big center of faith
 manyataon ke mutabik, ise dugdheshwar mandir bhi kehete hai
 The importance of this temple more than 300 BCE is as much as Kashi Vishwanath, that is why it is also called Chota Kashi
 rahul upi main apane siyaasi ran kii shuruyaat yahaan shankar ji kii puja archana karne ke baad hi karenge
 Former Congress MP from Kashi Rajesh Mishra reaches Rudrapur and says that, hopefully, Rahul ji will definitely come here to seek his blessings
 vaise puraane congressi bataate hai ki, 1998 main congress adhyaksh banane ke baad sonia gandhi ne dilli se baahar pehla siyaasi kadam yaheen rakhaa tha or mandir ke darshan bhi kiye the, haalanki tab wo baadh peediton se milane ai thim
 At the same time, Vishwan Ranjan Bharti, the Mahant of the temple said that, last time when Rahul came, Congress leader Akhilesh Pratap became an MLA, this time if he wants to ask Baba, then the desire to become Prime Minister will be fulfilled
 nath baba ke baad bajrang bali se bhi bal maangege rahulyuun hin nahin rahul gandhi kii ye siyaasi yatra mangalvaar ko shuru kii ja rahi he

 Rahul will seek his blessings as well, after which Rahul's khat chaupal will start between farmers and agricultural laborers
 haalanki rahul ke aadhikarik kaaryakramon main iskaa dharmik sthalon ke darshan kaa zikr nahin hai
 Actually, the party wants to give the message, but does not want to face the charge of doing politics of religion
 bhagwaan ke aashirwad ke baad shuru ho jaaegi rahul kii khaat panchayatauparavaale ke saamne maathaa techne ke baad rahul apni siyaasi yatra shuru kar denge
 For the Khat Panchayat, Khat and Charpai will be laid all over the ground
 jahaan rahul kisaanon or khet mazdooron kii samasyaayein sunenge
 There will also be questions and answers
 rahul modi sarkaar par puraane vaade na puure karne kaa thikra phodenge, to kisaanon or khet mazaduron se vaade kar congress ke liye vot maangenge
 Bringing the Congress away from power in UP for 27 years is no less a miracle, but with the new PK strategy, Rahul is trying once again after the failure of 2007 and 2012

 Tales of Premchand's era are still present in this society - this is the tragedy of this society, if you consider the stigma of your part by not giving the vision of writers like Premchand, it may be more beneficial for the society, Although the people of this village borrow money at the interest of 10 rupees hundred, this interest gets added every month, and instead of this, wages have to be paid

 That is why when we see children dying in Muzaffarpur, seeing the devastation of malnutrition, we consider it an event, not considering how an able society was made dependent on others, deaths of one hundred and fifty children Will also be forgotten in the same way as Gorakhpur, or other matters before it, which we do not remember truthfully, but when will that serious thought and initiative begin, when we dream of such an India, Programming free from the children's deaths

 So, is the Prime Minister going to write a new chapter in the relationship with Israel and end the historic attitude of India, which was different from Gandhi to Nehru
 mahatma gandhi ne 26 november 1938 ko harijan patrika main kai yahudiyon ko apana dost bataate hue likhaa tha ki yahudiyon ke liye dharm ke aadhaar par alag desh kii maang mujhe zyada apil nahin karti
 Palestine belongs to the Arabs, just as England belongs to the British and France belongs to the French and imposing Jews on the Arabs is wrong and inhuman
 itnaa hi nahin, 21 july 1946 ko likhe apane ek or lekh menmahatma gandhi likhaa- duniya ne yahudiyon ke saath bahut krurta kii he

 phir 11 july 1947 ko jawaab dete hue likhaa- main sweekaar karata hum ki mujhe yahudiyon ke prati bahut sahanubhuti he to arab logon ke liye bhi he
 i know that Jews have done a great job in Palestine and they have contributed a great deal in improving the standard of living of the people there but one question bothers me
 aakhir itane behtareen kaamon or uplabdhiyon ke baavjood wo arab kaa dil jeetne main kyon kaamyaab nahin hue
 Why do they want to force the Arabs to accept their demands against their wishes

 People with beautiful faces are more selfish than average looking humans
 aise log apane hit ke bare main hi adhik sochate hai
 Scientists at the University of Edinburgh, UK, during their research, studied the faces of 292 people up to the age of 83
 is dauraan khaastaur par chehre kii 15 visheshtaon par najar rakhi gayi
 These include the condition of the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears
 jin logon ke chehron main uparokt chizon kii sthiti main saamanjasy nahin paaya gaya yaa jinke chehre visham paae gaye, unke jivan main adhik sangharsh rahaa or unka bachapan kaaphi dikkaton main beetaa
 Such people appear to be suffering from malnutrition, disease, cigarette smoke and pollution whereas those with restrained faces appear to be healthier and more attractive
 aise log apane jivan main sirf or sirf apane bare main sochate dekhe gaye
 Looking at the faces of such people, it seems that their development has been stable but this has not affected their mood and due to this, they are seen thinking more about themselves
 23 farvari 2012 ko mumbai main 21 acre main faile enesji hub ke udghaatan ke samay daawa kiya gaya tha ki yah hub pashchimi bharat main kisi bhi aatanki hamale or plane hijac ko muhthod jawaab dene ke liye banaaya gaya he lekin kuch mahino ke bheetar hi badintjami kii pole khul gai he
 The then Home Minister p Chidambaram as well as the Chief Minister and Home Minister of India came for its inauguration
 mumbai ke is hub me rahane vaale commando ke khud ke jaan ke laale pad gaye hai
 The residential building for commandos and officers has been cracked in the hub
 parivaar kii suraksha ko dekhte hue inhen mumbai police ke marol training centre ke mekashift imaarat main bheja gaya he
 Commandos attached to the hub are stating that this condition is not just of the residential building but also some training buildings have also stopped counter terrorism training due to cracks
 enesji ke mumbai hub ke squad me 241 commando or adhikari hai
 anti-terror Operation Commandos have been deployed in Mumbai unit with special counter hijack
 aatanki oparation ke dauraan istemaal hone vaale snifer dog bhi rakhe gaye hai
 a helipad has also been built here for any special operation
 mumbai ke is hub me underground firing range banane kaa bhi prastaav rakhaa gaya tha
 Actually, the NSG base in Mumbai was needed during the 26 / 11 terror attacks
 tab enesji ke commando ko mansera ke base se mumbai aane main kaaphi vakt laga tha
 In the coming years, the Mumbai hub was built only to thwart any terrorist attack in Western India and to reach the commandos in minimum time
 enesji kaa mumbai hub 56 karod rupee kii laagat neshnal building construction corporation ne banwaaya tha lekin yah hub apni upyogita ke liye kam or vivaad ke liye zyada surkhiyon me bana rahaa
 During the construction of the Mumbai Hub, the NSG had demanded about 80 acres of land which included a proposal to build a training and residential building, but the Maharashtra government built only 23 acres of land, NSG Hub, bypassing the NSG demand
 vahiin duusari ore andhra pradesh sarkaar ne enesji ke liye 600 acre jameen di
 NSG officials were objecting to the pillars of the power grid passing over the ground provided for the Mumbai hub
 adhikariyon ke mutabik in khambo kii vajah se hub kii suraksha se samjhauta kiya ja rahaa he
 Due to the pillars of this power grid, the chopper's night landing cannot be done
 itnaa hi nahin, enesji ko apni fire practice ke liye mumbai police par hi nirbhar rahanaa pad rahaa he
 The comments enesji ke jawan esarpief ke goregaanv firing range par jate hai
 During the deployment in Marol in 2010, many commandos were also ill due to the supply of dirty water
 philhal, enesji ne iaiti rudki ke jaankaron se imaarat main hone vaali daraar kaa pataa laga lagaakar bhavishya me uski rokthaam kaa pataa lagane ko kaha he jisamen ek saal tak kaa vakt lag saktaa he

 The commandos living in this hub of Mumbai have lost their lives
 hub main commando or adhikariyon ke liye bani rihaayshi imaarat me daraar pad gai he
 Considering the safety of the family, they have been sent to the makeshift building of Marol Training Center of Mumbai Police
 hub se jude commando bataa rahe hai ki yah haalat sirf rihaayshi imaarat kii nahin he balki kuch training imaaraton main bhi daraar kii vajah se unpar hone vaali counter terrerism training roak di gai he
 The nsg's Mumbai Hub squad has 241 commandos and officers
 mumbai unit me vishesh counter hijac ke saath anti−teror oparation commando kii tainaati kii gai he
 Sniffer dogs used during terrorist operations are also kept
 kisi bhi special oparation ke liye yahaan ek helipad bhi banaaya gaya he
 It was also proposed to build an underground firing range in this hub of Mumbai
 darasal, mumbai main enesji ke base kii jarurat 26 / 11 aantki hamalon ke dauraan hui thi
 It was then that the NSG commandos took a long time to come to Mumbai from the base of Mansera
 aane vaale vakt main pashchimi bharat main kisi bhi aatanki hamale ko naakaam karne or commando ko kam se kam vakt me pahunchane ke liye hi mumbai hub banwaaya gaya tha
 nsg's Mumbai hub was built by the National Building Construction Corporation at a cost of Rs 56 crore, but the hub remained less for its utility and more for controversy
 mumbai hub banavaane ke dauraan enesji ne lagbhag 80 acre jameen kii maang kii thi jisamen training or rihaayshi imaarat banavaane kaa prastaav shaamil tha lekin enesji kii maang ko darkinar kar maharashtra sarkaar ne sirf 23 eq kii jameen enesji hub banwaaya
 On the other hand, Andhra Pradesh government gave 600 acres of land for NSG
 enesji se jude adhikari mumbai ke hub ke liye di gai jameen ke upar se guzarane vaale power grid ke khambhon par aitraaj jataa rahe the
 According to officials, the safety of the hub is being compromised because of these poles
 is power grid ke khambhon kii vajah se choper kii nite landing bhi nahi karwaai ja sakati
 Not only this, the NSG has to depend on the Mumbai Police for its fire practice
 tippaniyan NSG personnel go to the Goregaon firing range of SRPF
 saal 2010 main marol me tainaati ke vakt gande pani kii supplai kii vajah se kai commando biimaar bhi hue the
 At present, the NSG has asked the IIT Roorkee experts to find out the crack in the building and find out its prevention in the future which may take up to a year
 parivaar kii suraksha ko dekhte hue inhen mumbai police ke marol training centre ke mekashift imaarat main bheja gaya he

 halaki police ne 7 main se 6 ladakiyon ko darbhanga se baraamad kar liya he, lekin ek ladki abhi bhi nahin mili he
 One of the 7 girls who escaped together from Mokama's shelter home is yet to be found
 police kii kai timen faraar balika kaa pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahi hai or lagaataar bihar, bengal main chhapemari kar rahi hai
 Significantly, 3 days ago, there was a stir in the administrative office after 7 girls had run away from the girls' reform home in Mokama
 haalanki usee din der raat tak police ne chhapemari karte hue 6 ladakiyon ko bihar ke darbhanga se baraamad kar liya tha
 While the police are still looking for the 7th girl
 police kii jaanch main yah baat saamne ai he ki jis gril ko katkar ladakiyon ke bhaagane kii baat sanstha kii taraf se kii ja rahi thi, usamen koi dam nahin tha balki ladkiyaan mukhya daravaaje se bhaagi thim
 Was the motive behind the escape of the girls to affect the Muzaffarpur girl child case
 police is maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he, lekin jaanch main ye baat saamne jarur ai ki ladkiyaan yahaan rahanaa nahin chaahati thim
 Their constant opposition to this was going on inside the institution
 sabase badi baat he ki balika grih maamle main fajihat jhel rahaa bihar sarkaar kaa samaaj kalyaan vibhaag abhi bhi laaparvaahee barat rahaa he
 Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai is witnessing high-voltage drama these days
 aane vaale dinon main sho main kaayrav kii castady ko lekar hangaamaa hone vaala he
 At the same time, Vedika will also want to leave Karthik
 bollywood life kii reports ke mutabik, sho main karthik kaayrav kii castady mil jaaegi
 Karthik will come home with Kairava
 vahiin naira se bhi karthik kaa talaak ho jayega
 But even after all this, Vedika will fail to get Karthik's attention
 jab kaayrav ghar aa jayega to karthik kaayrav ke saath biji ho jayega
 He will not give time to Vedika
 kaayrav karthik ko baar-baar naira kii yaad dilaaegaa, jisaki vajah se vedika udhaas ho jaaegi
 Fed up with all this, Vedika will decide to separate from Karthik
 in dinon chal rahe plot kii baat karen to bataa den ki naira karthik ko talaak ke papers bhejti he or kaayrav sang goa jane kaa plan banaati he
 After this, Karthik will get very angry
 karthik naira ko kaayrav kii castady ke papers bhejega or donon kaayrav kii castady ke liye ladenge
 The show will get a twist
 naira ko jab koi acha vakil nahin milegaa to wo khud vakil banakar apane bachche kii castady kaa cese ladegi
 But the case will not win
 dobaaraa shaadi karenge karthik-naira?bataa den ki reports ke mutabik,sho main karthik or naira kii dobaaraa shaadi karne ja rahe hai
 Both will be married once again in Rajasthan
 isi jagah par karthik or naira kii pehle bhi shaadi hui thi
 However, the makers have not confirmed it yet
 dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki aane vaale dinon main sho main or koun-kaunse mode aaenge
 Amidst the government's efforts to market the worth of $ 1,000 billion worth of gold in the country, everyone's eyes are on temples with huge reserves of such gold
 haalanki inamen se kai mandiron ke sanchaalkon ko is baat kii ashanka he ki shraddhaluon se daan main praapt swarna aabhushanon va vastuon ko sarkari yojana ke liye galane se dharmik bhavanaaen aahat ho sakati hai
 Officials of the rich and famous temples at various places across the country, while speaking on the subject said that it is hardly possible for them to participate immediately in the government's golden monetization scheme, but officials of some temples said that the scheme is worth noting
 haalanki, unhen bhi is par abhi koi pakkaa nirnay nahin kiya he
 Court cases are being made in the road for some temples like Rodadasari Ore, Sri Padmanabhaswamy in Kerala and Shirdi Sai Baba in Maharashtra
 kerala, karnataka, telugana or rajasthan main pramukh mandiron se is skim ke prati thandi pratikriya mili he, jabaki andhra pradesh, pashchim bengal or gujarat main kuch mandiron ne isamen ruchi dikhaai he
 However, most of these temples are concerned about issues such as price degradation in the process of smelting the jewelery and hurting the religious sentiments of the devotees who donate gold ornaments in the name of the deities of the temple
 kya he yojana or prakriyagauratlab he kipradhanmantri narendra modidwara pichley maheene shuru kii gai mahatvakankshi swarna maudrikaran yojana kaa lakshya makaanon, dharmik sansthaanon or anya jagahon par pade anumaanit 22,000 ton sone ko vittiya pranali main laana he
 Gold can also be deposited as jewelery, but banks melt it and after checking its purity decide the value of the deposited jewelery
 somnath mandir ne taiyaar kiya prastaavgujrat main vibhinn mandiron main prasiddh ambaji mandir ne philhal is skim ke liye sona jamaa karne se manaa kar diya he, jabaki somnath mandir ne is sambandh main ek prastaav taiyaar kiya he or antim nirnay mandir ke trustiyon dwaara kiya jayega
 The Dwarkadhish temple in Devbhumi Dwarka has to decide on this, but the chairman of the temple trust committee HK Patel said the scheme is worth considering
 siddhivinayak mandir ne dikhaai dilchaspeemumbai main prasiddh siddhivinayak mandir ne skim main dilchaspee dikhaai he or vah apane 160 kilogram sone ke bhandaron kaa upyog karne ke vibhinn vikalpon par vichaar kar rahaa he
 Out of this, about 10 kg of gold has already been deposited with a bank
 tirmala tirupati devsthanam kii ucch stareey nivesh samiti is skim ke tahat sona jamaa karne ke mudde par vichaar ke liye jald hi baithak karegaa, vahiin andhra pradesh ke vijaywada main kanakadurgamma mandir kii is yojana main bhagidaari karne kii koi yojana nahin he
 How strong the congress-bjp competition is in Pokhran's seat can be gauged from the fact that both Rahul Gandhi and Yogi Adityanath have come here and asked for votes
 aaj kal BJP or usko cover karne vaali media main yah charchaa ho rahi he ki jo bhi bijepi main gumnaam hota he, vahi kuch hota he
 The one who is not in much discussion opens his lottery and that is what is made
 isliye ab media ko unheen logon par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie jo party main kaddavar naa ho, charchit naa hon
 About which no one can think that this person will reach the office of such and such, it becomes something
 modi-amit shah kii jodi unheen logon par daanv lagaati he, jinke bare main media nahin soch saktaa yaa jo logon kii najaron se dur ho
 It is also being said that Modi proves the media wrong
 isliye media main yah baat charchaa main he ki bade-bade logon ke bare main, charchit naamon ke bare main sochane kii bajaae gumnaam chehron ke bare main, lo profile chehron ke bare main sochna chahie
 He will be a famous face one day
 sabase taaja udhaahranendie ke raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ramnath kovindka he
 The name had not come in anyone's mind that they could also be presidential candidates
 media ho yaa party ke netaa koi bhi un tak pahunch nahin paaya tha, soch nahin paaya tha
 The names of Murali Manohar Joshi, Sushma Swaraj, Sumitra Mahajan were all being discussed in the media, but the name of Bihar Governor Ramnath Kovind came up
 isse pehle bhi chaahe haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter kyon naa ho, unako mukhyamantri banane se pehle tamaam tarah ke naam chal rahe the
 Khattar first became an MLA, then Chief Minister
 ve sanghathan main lo profile netaa ke rup main jane jate the
 Meanwhile, Trivendra Rawatlow was a profile leader in Uttarakhand
 bade-bade netaaon kii charchaa ho rahi thi, lekin aakhir main trivendra ravat bane
 In Jharkhand also Raghuvar Das low profile leader was not much discussed
 mukhyamantri ko lekar bade-bade netaaon kii charchaa vahaan bhi thi, lekin raghuvar das ne baaji maari
 On top of big names, Modi brought anonymity to big names and big leaders by bringing low profile and anonymous faces to big positions or rather to the front
 ab charchaa is baat ko lekar he ki bhavishya main banane vaale rajyapalon, mantrimandaleey pherbadal main banane vaale mantri kahin aise naam naa hon, jo lo profile ho or jinaki koi charchaa naa ho
 Those who know Modi and political analysts believe that Modi thinks the opposite of whatever popular names are
 yahi vajah he ki modi hameshaa media or raajnneetik galiyaaron main ho rahi charchaaon ko galat sabit karte hai
 It is no longer hidden that drugs have an important role in the death of Anmol, and after this incident, once again it remains a matter of debate in the whole city that what are the areas of Delhi and its surroundings where a consignment of intoxication is found, which is used indiscriminately at night parties

 But no one can deny the fact that the party after which Anmol died, drugs were used there and this incident has once again shaken the section of Delhi, towards which even in the context of crime, raising an eye Don't see wo he padhe-likhe or paise waalon kii jamaat
 It is undoubtedly not hidden that in the capital, the nobles of many rich people are often seen wandering from Noida to Gurgaon in search of expensive drugs

 Which includes cocaine, hashish, heroin, hashish, smack and hemp

 But according to sources of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and Narcotics Bure, no consignment of LSD has been caught even once in the last four years

 Apparently, the cartel of drugs is increasing in the number of drug addicts in Delhi

 But the BJP strategists made one plan after another, which made them fall behind in terms of forming a government and the Congress had to get away from power

 nitesh tiwari ke nirdesan main bani film chhichhore kaa trailor relies kar diya gaya he
 The film will be released on 30 August and stars Sushant Singh Rajput in the lead role
 sushant ke alaava varun sharma, tushaar pandey, pratik babbar or shraddha kapur ahm kirdaar nibhaa rahe hai
 The trailer has been released on Fox Star Hindi's verified youtube channel and is going viral very fast
 haalanki ek negative point ye bhi he ki trailor ko dekhakar aapako aamir khan kii 3 idiyats yaad aane lagati he
 What is the story of the film, the film takes you to that phase of college, which most people consider to be the most beautiful time of their life
 kahani kuch aise doston kii he jo college main ek duusare ke pakke yaar hote hai
 The film can be called a roller coaster journey filled with the ups and downs of college life, which sometimes tickles you and sometimes makes you emotional
 bollywood main college life par bahut zyada superhit filmein nahin bani hai
 3 Idiots and Student of the Year are named in such selected films
 film kaa trailor dekhte hue aapako kuch moments par rajkumaar kii 3 idiyats kii yaad dilaataa he
 These include scenes such as a friend's accident and the rest arriving to take care of him
 kaisaa he trailor:trailor dekhakar lagata he ki nitesh tiwari rajkumaar hiraani kaa record todane ja rahe hai
 The trailer begins with the role being tied by Sushant Singh Rajput, in which he speaks about the beauty of college life
 iske baad trailor aapako lekar jaataa he us jarney par jahaan college main kuch alag-alag jagahon se aae anjaan ladke jindagi bhar ke liye pakke dost ban jate hai
 The acting of all the actors is capable-a-compliment and the dialogues look good too
 trailor aapako khulkar to nahin hansaa paata lekin dialogs or sichuations aapke chehre par muskaan laane ke liye kaaphi hai
 When you compare Nitesh's Chichhora with 3 Idiots, one big difference is that the story does not follow any singular track
 chijen bas college kii jindagi ke dauraan hoti ja rahi hai
 Storylines like the film are seen in the trailer, people are making fun of it on social media and are describing it as the Student of the Year for the poor
 nitesh isse pehle dangal, bareli kii barfi or bhootnath riterns jaisi filmein bana chuke hai
 It has to be seen what the film does at the box office

 Mamani has presented herself as the prime contender for being made a minister
 anand ne kaha ki karnataka vidhansabha main bijepi ke 105 vidhayak hai
 Of these, 16 come from the panchamshil-lingayat community
 isamen se kise mantri banaaya ja rahaa he?anand ne kaha, 'main bhi mantri banane kaa icchhuk hum
 My family has a political history

 Let us tell you that after the fall of the HD Kumaraswamy-led jds-congress coalition government last month, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has formed the government in Karnataka
 bies yediurppa ne 26 july 2019 ko chauthi baar karnataka ke mukhyamantri ke rup main shapath lee thi
 This time JD (S) and rebel legislators of Congress helped BJP to form government in the state
 agar ye vidhayak apni party se baghawat nahin karte, to bijepi kii sarkaar nahin banati he
 In such a situation, the question is now arising here whether the Yeddyurappa government can give any reward to the rebel mlas of JDS and Congress?

 com / 2ze6mgktd8 Pakistan defeated hosts South Africa by six wickets in the first ODI, but Hashim was the only one before that
 vajah yah thi ki unhone todaa daalaa tha viraat kohli kaa record
 Hashim smashed 108 off 120 balls with 7 fours and 1 six
 isse dakshin africa 266 ran banane main kaamyaab rahaa tha
 But Virat Kohli's record of making the fastest 27 centuries has now been broken by Hashim Amla
 jahaan viraat kohli ne apana 27waan shatak 169veen pari main banaaya tha, to hashim amala ne yah karnama unase do pehle 167 pariyon main hi kar daalaa
 Kohli set this record in the year 2017 in Pune
 nishchit hi yah ek bada record he, lekin kohli ke chaahane vaale kah rahe hai ki isse unhen koi fark nahin padataa kyonki kohli record or ballebaaj ke taur par bahut aage nikal chuke hai
 Kohli's supporters say that even though Hashim has scored 27th century before Kohli, he will never break Virat's record of 39 centuries
 or is daawey main dam bhi he
 Amla is over 35 years old

 Here is the key excerpt of this conversation: Mr
 External Affairs Minister, you adopted diplomacy of pressure to isolate Pakistan but it is not benefiting
 lagata he, pakistan ke khilaaf aap kootnithik ladaai haar chuke hai
 i do not believe in the use of words like pressure
 yah koi kootnithik ladaai nahin he, balki yah kootneeti he
 The issue here is - effective action against terrorism and dismantling of terrorism infrastructure to prevent future attacks
 aatank ke kartadhartaaon or iske shikaar logon ko nishchit rup se alag-alag nazariye se dekhne kii jarurat he
 We are doing what any responsible country would do after such a situation
 lekin aapaki seemaa kya he? karrwai karne ke liye kya aap agle hamale kaa intjaar karenge?nahin, aisa nahin hoga
 You should understand that diplomacy takes time
 yah koi turat-phurat tarika nahin he ki kisi ne kabhi bhi switch jala diya yaa bujh diya
 Sometimes this process can be delayed but it is necessary to try it
 kabhi-kabhi lagata he ki aapane apni kootneeti america or pashchim ko outsource kar di he
 this is not right
 ham har kisi se kah rahe hai ki aapako pakistan par dabaav daalana chahie kyonki yah mahaj bharat-pakistan sambandhon kii baat nahin he
 There is no need to look at such issues from the perspective of this relationship
 asal main ye vaishvik aatankwaad kaa hissaa hai or inkaa muqabla mil-julkar kiya janaa chahie
 You have given them 40-50 pages of evidence and despite this their President says that this is just information
 mujhe aapako yah saaf taur par bataanaa chahie ki pakistan abhi tak naa-nukur hi kar rahaa he
 The information was gathered on the basis of evidence only
 jab koi aparaadh hota he, to pehali baat yah kii jaati ki police exiar darj karti he
 It is only after this that the investigation is done
 hamane unako mahaj soochna hi nahin di he balki saamagree bhi muhaiyaa karai he jiske aadhaar ve aage kii chaanbin kar sakate hai
 These methods are to divert attention from the major issue
 pakistan se aap kya chaahate hai?ham chaahate hai ki ve un bhartiya bhagodon ko hamaare hawaale kar den jo yahaan se bhaag gaye hai
 Those who planned the Mumbai attack should be prosecuted
 mukadmaa nishpaksh or paardarshee tareeke se hona chahie na ki mahaj lipapoti
 To be prosecuted by due process
 ve unhen dandit karen
 Only then will we be satisfied
 kya aap kah rahe hai ki hamale main shaamil pakistan ke nagarikon par mukadmaa unke yahaan chalaaya jaae? kya aap un par yahaan mukadmaa nahin chalaayenge?haa, yah ho saktaa he
 There should be transparency in the lawsuit
 hamane ajmal kasaab ko pakadaa he
 But there are other people who were part of this conspiracy
 unako pakadaa janaa chahie or un par vahaan mukadmaa chalaaya janaa chahie
 The authorities there should not leave them a holiday
 kya aap unhen yahaan laana nahin chaahate?agar ve unhen hamaare hawaale karte hai, to hamen khushi hogi
 But if they do not do so, then at least they hand over the criminals who have committed crime here, have broken the law, and have taken shelter there
 lekin kya aapako sachmuch ummid he ki pakistan kuch karegaa?mujhe ummid he ki dabaav kii vajah se pakistan ko apni un jimmedaariyon ko puraa karne main aasaani hogi jo vibhinn antarrashtriya maanakon or faislon se jude hone kii vajah se us par he
 You are saying that everyone is pressurizing but the US is planning to triple the civilian aid given to Pakistan? i cannot explain the conduct of other countries
 yah sachaai he jiske saath hamen rahanaa he
 UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband came here and disagreed with you that the Government of Pakistan supports terrorism
 maine unhen bataaya ki ham unki samaj se sahamat nahin hai
 Pakistan says it wants a joint investigation
 pakistani netritv se main yahi sawaal poochna changa kyonki khud raashtrapati jaradaari benazir bhutto kii hatya kii jaanch antarrashtriya agenciyon se karwaanaa chaahate the
 i do not think that any joint investigation will benefit
 kya aap maanate hai ki antarrashtriya samudaay bharat ke sainik vikalp apnaane ko manjuur karegaa?hamaare saare vikalp khule hai
 i can only say that the appropriate option will be adopted at the appropriate time
 kya pakistan ek asafal raashtra he?main is vishesh shabd kaa istamol nahin karnaa chahta lekin pakistan main satta ke kai centre hai or vahaan samanvay kaa abhaav he
 Your junior colleague e Ahmed has said that we should end all diplomatic relations with Israel

 Ahmed is an important leader of his party
 unhone apane vichaar prakat kiye hai

 jab grih mantri ne is mudde par jawaab de diya or or sthiti spasht kar di to ve santusht ho gaye
 All your ministers speak different languages at the same time
 misaal ke taur par grih mantri ne visa kam karne, vyapaarik sambandhon ko khatm karne kii baat kahi
 Didn't he speak on issues related to your ministry? The question of options for him was theoretical
 maine faisla liya he ki main vikalpon kaa khulaasa nahin karuunga or main isi niti par chaluungaa
 If anyone makes a theoretical explanation of these options, i do not think it is against policies

 in chunaavon main koun se mudde haaavee rahenge? kya aatankwaad unamem ek khaas mudda hoga?pradarshan, vikaas or netritv aagaamee chunaavon main pramukh mudde honge
 Leadership has a special role but questions are being raised after your statement about Rahul Gandhi being the candidate for Prime Minister? i was answering questions at the Pravasi Bharatiya Sammelan
 kisi ne mujhase poocha ki bharat main bujurg netritv kyon he? maine unako dheron udhaaharan bataae, jaise prafull mahant, umr abdulla, or maine kaha ki rajeev gandhi 40 saal kii umr main desh ke pradhanmantri ban gaye, phir maine kaha ki koun jaanata he ki rahul gandhi ek din apane pita ke padchinhon par chalem
 So you are not denying Manmohan Singh as the next Prime Minister? Certainly some constituents of the UPA have said that they will contest elections under the leadership of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne bhi aisa hi kaha he
 So are you saying that the upcoming elections will be fought under Manmohan Singh's leadership and there is no doubt about it? Yes
 aisa hi hoga
 What is the future of the ever-present Pranab Mukherjee? i am missing an old song line that whatever will happen, will happen, future is not our thing to see

 The film 'rang Rasiya', based on the novel 'raja Ravi Varma' written by Ranjit Desai, is the story of Raja Ravi Varma, a painter
 bharat ke aadhunik chitrakaaron main unka naam sabase pehle aata he, or kahani 110 saal pehle ke bharat main ghati
 It is shown in the film that he was a painter who brought the gods and goddesses and brought them home
 ravi verma ne jab apane chitra main apni kalpana ko sari pahanaai to vah fishan main aa gai
 He also gave money to Dada Saheb Phalke for the first film
 iske alaava desh main sabase pehla printing press bhi raja ravi verma ne hi lagaaya tha
 That is, Raja Ravi Varma was a versatile painter who wanted to reach everyone's heart through his art
 vah aashiq bhi the, or apni mahabuuba kii nagn tasviren bhi banaaya karte the
 Director Ketan Mehta has beautifully portrayed many aspects of Raja Ravi Varma's life

 The same debate was held in that court whether the thinking and imagination of an artist should be banned
 
 
 aaj bhi vakt-be-vakt aise aarope or cese adaalat ke daravaaje tak pahunchate rahete hai
 The film was to be released in the year 2008, but even after six years, the film does not look old, because the story and painting of Raja Ravi Varma are probably not old yet, and Ketan Mehta has also made the film like painting, So from my side the rating of this film is - 3
 5 star

 Amit Shah said that as Prime Minister of Narendra Modi, people of any religion in the country need not fear

 'big bos' ke ghar main 73wein din swami om ne apni manamaani chalaane kii koshish kii, haalanki vah safal nahin hue or is kaaran gharavaalon ke gusse kaa shikaar bhi hue
 The day started with the song 'mast Bahar Ka Main Aashiq'
 duusare din bhi tufaan task jari rahaa, din ke pehle tufaan main bani je task se disqualifi ho gayi
 Immediately after this, Swami Om once again sat outside Igloo by putting a stool
 is dauraan vah camere se baat bhi karte rahe he ki vah buudhe hai or dur rahenge to iglu main ghus nahin paaenge
 Angered by Swami Om's antics, Rohan Mehra decided that he would not let him go ahead in the task
 iske liye vah swami om ke thik saamne stool lagaakar is tarah baith gaye ki swami om iglu main na ghus saken
 After this, while speaking of heat, he removed his Kashmiri cloth and sat down like that
 swami om kii is harakat ne sabhi gharavaalon ko chaunkaa diya
 Later, on Manveer's request, he put his clothes back on
 is bich bani je apane dost gaurav chopra se is baat par ladane lageen ki unhone khaane ke liye unka intjaar nahin kiya
 At this, Gaurav told Bani that he should not make the point of such a small thing
 sho ke ant main donon ke bich ek baar phir bahes ho gai
 The comments jab kaaphi der tak rohan or swami om iglu ke saamne se nahin uthe tab 'big bos' ne ek chitthee bheji or lopa ko nirdesh diya ki chitthee ke saath bheje gaye spray kii madad se vah ek bada 'D' banaaen or nirdesh die ki tufaan aane se pehle koi bhi sadsy us 'D' ke andar nahin jayega
 During this time when Lopa asked Swami Om to keep his feet out of the mark, he started fighting with them too
 iske baad jab tufaan aayaa to sabhi sadsy iglu ke andar ghuse lekin gharavaale yah tay nahin kar paa rahe the ki iglu main lopa aakhri main ghusin yaa swami om
 Solving the problems of the family, 'bigg Boss' said that Swami Om had entered the latter at Igloo, so he is disqualified from the task
 is faisle se om swami naaraaz ho gaye or 'big bos' par bhedbhaav karne kaa aarope lagane lage, vah yah bhi kehane lage ki weekend kaa waar main vah salmaan khan se is bare main baat bhi karenge
 When the storm came for the third time in the day, Manu, Manveer and Rohan entered into Igloo while Lopamudra remained outside
 iske baad manavir ne manu se kaha ki vah unhen janmdin kaa gift dena chaahate hai or isliye vah unhen or rohan ko andar jane denge or khud baad main jaaenge
 At this, Manu explained to them that play the game like a game and both would go in together
 task se baahar hone ke baad bhi swami om apana ganda khel khilne se baj nahin aae, vah iglu ke entress ke paas khadey ho gaye
 When the storm came, he grabbed the collar of Rohan going inside Igloo and tried to pull him out
 haalanki manu punjabi samay rahete iglu main nahin ghus paae or task se baahar ho gaye
 After this, the family members reprimanded him for Swami's actions and said that this could have hurt Rohan
 din kaa ant manu punjabi ke berthde celibrasion ke saath hua
 His girlfriend Piku sent him a cake which he cut together with everyone
 kal ke episod main ham dekhenge ki captaini kaa final muqabla rohan or manavir ke bich hoga or is mukaable main bhi swami om rohan ke khilaaf harakatein karte dikhenge
 Now it will be interesting to see whether Rohan gets the captaincy of the house or Manveer
 swami om kii harkaton se naaraaz rohan mehara ne tay kiya ki vah unhen task main aage nahin jane denge
 For this, he sat a stool in front of Swami Om in such a way that Swami Om could not enter into Igloo
 iske baad garmi lagane kii baat kehete hue unhone apane kashmiri kapade kaa loar utaar diya or aise hi baith gaye
 This act of Swami Om surprised all the family members
 baad main manavir ke kehane par unhone kapade waapas pahane
 Meanwhile, Bani j started fighting with her friend Gaurav Chopra over the fact that he did not wait for her to eat
 is par gaurav ne bani se kaha ki unhen itani choti si baat kaa mudda nahin bananaa chahie
 At the end of the show, the two once again had a debate
 tippaniyan When Rohan and Swami did not get up in front of Om Igloo for a long time, 'bigg Boss' sent a letter and instructed Lopa to make a big 'D' with the help of the spray sent with the letter and instructed that the storm No member will enter inside that 'D' before arriving
 is dauraan jab lopa ne swami om se kaha ki vah apane pair nishaan se baahar rakhen to vah unase bhi ladane lage
 After this, when the storm came, all the members entered inside Igloo but the family members were not able to decide whether Lopa entered Igloo or Swami Om
 gharavaalon kii samasya kaa samaadhaan karte hue 'big bos' ne kaha ki iglu main swami om sabase baad main ghuse the isliye vah task se disqalifai kiye jate hai
 Om Swamy was angered by this decision and started accusing 'bigg Boss' of being discriminated against, he even started saying that he would talk to Salman Khan about this on Weekend Ka Vaar
 din main jab teesri baar tufaan aayaa tab manu, manavir or rohan iglu main ghus gaye jabaki lopamudra baahar hi rah gayi
 After this Manveer told Manu that he wanted to give him a birthday gift and so he would let him and Rohan in and go on their own later
 is par manu ne unhen samajhaayaa ki game ko game kii tarah hi khelen or donon saath andar jaaenge
 Even after being out of the task, Swami Om did not desist from playing his dirty game, he stood near Igloo's entrance
 jab tufaan aayaa to unhone iglu ke andar jate rohan kaa collar pakadakar unhen baahar khinchne kii koshish kii
 However, Manu Punjabi could not enter Igloo in time and got out of the task
 iske baad swami kii is harakat ke liye gharavaalon ne unhen jamkar fatkaar lagaai or kaha ki isse rohan ko chot lag sakati thi
 The day ended with Manu Punjabi's birthday celebration
 unke liye unki garlfriend piku ne kek bheja tha jise unhone sabake saath milakar kaata
 In tomorrow's episode, we will see that the final match of captaincy will be between Rohan and Manveer and in this match also Swami will be seen doing actions against Om Rohan

 CRPC kii dhara 432 main die gaye centre sarkaar kii salaah ke kya myne hai?kya iskaa matlab centre sarkaar kii manjuuri he
 Does life imply full life and the prisoner cannot be released by pardon
 kya supreme court aise kaidiyon ke liye nai shrenee bana saktaa he jinaki sajaa faansee se ghataakar umrakaid kar di gai ho
 Will he have to spend his entire life in jail without apology? agar maafee ke aadhaar par rihaai kerani ho to ye adhikaar centre sarkaar ko hona chahie yaa rajya sarkaar ko
 The Supreme Court stayed the decision of the Jayalalithaa government and sent the case to the constitution bench of 5 judges
 court ne saare rajyon ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga tha or faisla aane tak umrakaid ke kaidiyon ko reeha naa karne ke aadesh die the
 a Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice will decide
 
 
 kya raashtrapati yaa rajyapal yaa supreme court dwaara faansee kii sajaa ko umrakaid main badalane par rajya sarkaar kisi kii sajaa ko maaf kar reeha kar sakati he
 What is the meaning of Central Government's advice given in Section 432 of CRPC? Does it mean Central Government approval
 kya umrakaid kaa matlab puri umr he or kaidi ko maafee dekar reeha nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Can the Supreme Court create a new category for such prisoners whose punishment has been reduced from execution to life imprisonment
 kya unhen bina maafee puri umr jail main kaatani hogi
 If released on the basis of amnesty, then the central government or the state government should have these rights

 There was news for a long time that Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone could work in director Kabir Singh's film 83
 khabar thi ki deepika is film main ranvir singh kii patni kaa kirdaar nibhaati najar aaengi
 Now, justifying the rumors, Deepika Padukone herself has said that she is a part of the film 83
 times of india ko die ek intervyuu main deepika ne bataaya ki ve film 83 main kapil dev kii patni romi bhaatia kaa kirdaar nibhaane vaali hai
 She also said that if someone other than Kapil Dev was playing Ranvir Singh, she would have done the role of Romi
 deepika padukon ne kaha, "hamaari personal equation hamaare kaam ko prabhavit nahin karti he
 i can't think of any other actor who could do justice to Kapil Dev's role, but i would have played my character even if another actor was also playing him in this film
 " unhone aage kaha, "ye hamaari personal equation se nahin he balki film ke liye mere pishan or utsaah kii vajah se he
 "this will be the first film together after the wedding of Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh
 deepika ne is bare main kaha, "jab aap filmon ke bijness main hote hai tab aap ek kirdaar nibhaa rahe hai
 All this has not happened yet, but in the end it has to happen that you have to play your character and at that time you do not think that your co-star is your husband, brother or someone close to you
 aap bas us samay apane role ke saath nyaay karne kii koshish karte hai
 "deepika is currently working on the film Chhapak with Meghna Gulzar
 unhone bataaya, "main behad khush hum ki kabir khan is film ko lekar mere paas aae
 This happened a few months ago when Kabir was looking for boys for his film
 us samay main apni film chhapaak ko lekar vyast thi or ham is baat kaa elaan karne ke liye sahi maukey kii talash kar rahe the
 "view this post on instagrama post shared by Deepika Padukone (@deepikapadukone) onfeb 20, 2019 at 8:58 am PST Let us know that some time ago a source was quoted in the news about Deepika's character
 yah kaha gaya ki "film main deepika kaa role acha he kyonki ve kapil dev kii patni romi bhaatia kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahi hai, jo khud ek pegent vinar hai
 It is believed that she left the stadium when Romi saw India's team falling wickets one after the other in the 1983 match
 lekin jab unhone suna ki team world cap jeetne kii kagaar par he to romi stadium main waapas aa gayi
 This part is very dramatic
 iske alaava film main kapil or romi kii prem kahani ko dikhaaya jaayegaa
 "let me tell you that in the film 83, Ranveer Singh is playing the role of Kapil Dev, the cricketer and former captain of the Indian cricket team
 is film main kapil or unki team ke 1983 ke world cap jeetne kii kahani dikhaai jaaegi

 Indian cricket has been shocked by the exclusion of legendary batsmen such as Don Bradman and Sachin Tendulkar in former England umpire Dickie Bird's all-time Test XI
 kuch purv cricketron ne to bird ke sangyojan ko ‘bhedbhaavpurn’ or ‘asantulit’ qaraar diya he
 The only Indian to feature in this controversial team as former captain Sunil Gavaskar, while Pakistan all-rounder Imran Khan has been named its captain
 tendulkar or breadman ke alaava bryan lara or riki ponting jaise mahaan ballebaajon tathaa westeindies ke diggaj tej gendbaajon mailkam marshall, endi robrts, joel garnor or maaikel holding ko bhi bird kii team main jagah nahin mili he
 Other members of the team Bird selected in an interview before his 80th birthday include Barry Richards, Vivian Richards, Greg Chappell, Graeme Pollack, Gary Sobers, Ellen Nate, Shane Warne, Dennis Lillee and Lance Gibbs
 bharat ke purv captain ajit wadekar kaa maananaa he ki gavaskar salaami ballebaaj ke liye sahi pasand hai lekin vah tendulkar, breadman or westeindies ke tej gendbaajon ko jagah nahin milane se hairaan hai
 Wadekar said that there is some discrimination in it
 unhone unheen khilaadiyon ko chunaa he jinhen unhone kareeb se dekha he lekin sangyojan santulit nahin he
 Gavaskar should have been there but Sachin Tendulkar, Don Bradman and the West Indies fast bowlers are not surprising
 wadekar ne kaha ki lily ke saath nayi gend koun saajha karegaa
 It is also surprising that none of India's star spin quartet of Bishan Bedi, Erapalli Prasanna, BS Chandrasekhar and r Venkataraghavan has been selected
 ellen naat kii jagah adam gilcrist kaa chayan adarsh hota
 Former India batsman Chandu Borde said that not including Tendulkar and Bradman shows how aware of Bird's cricket was
 borde ne kaha ki yah uskaa apana najariya he
 He certainly would not have seen Bradman playing
 is team se aap dekh sakate hai ki uski cricket kii jaankaree kisi thi
 The figures will talk you about Bradman and Tendulkar
 kisi ko uski ekadash par dhyaan dene kii jarurat nahin he
 From my point of view, England's media made Bird a great umpire
 vah hameshaa bhedbhaav karata tha
 Former Indian captain Narri Contractor is surprised that Bird chose the team on some basis that players like Tendulkar and Bradman did not get a place in it
 kontractor ne kaha ki yah vyaktigat najariya he lekin mujhe nahin pataa ki usne kis aadhaar par team chuni
 We all know about Bradman and Tendulkar
 inke alaava westeindies kii tej gendbaaji chaukadi (maaikel holding, colin craft, joel garnor or endi robrts) ko bhi shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 Former Indian captains Dilip Vengsarkar and Krishnamachari Srikkanth refused to react to this
 vengsarakar ne kaha ki main is par pratikriya nahin dena chahta

 The Chinese media has warned that it did not do the kind of restrained behavior India had expected after Doklam, and that the 'infiltration' of drones by India could have serious consequences
 chini media kaa daawa he ki bharat kaa drone sikkim seemaa ke paas doklam ilaake main gira he or bharat ko is 'drone ghuspaith' ke liye maafee maangani chahie
 "the incursion of this incursion may be more than just losing a drone," says an editorial in China's official newspaper Global Times
 bharat ko is drone ghuspaith ke liye maafee maangani chahie
 "india has not learned any lesson! The Global Times said," India is taking advantage of China's generosity
 garmiyon main chini seemaa main bhartiya sainikon kii ghuspaith ke baad ab usne drone ke dwaara phir aisa kiya he
 From this it seems that India is taking provocative action
 aisa lagata he ki bharat ne doklam se koi sabak nahin siikhaa he
 China should respond to this strictly
 'chini media kaa daawa he ki bhartiya drone kii 'ghuspaith'sikkim simaake paas doklam sector main chini kshetra main hui he
 This is the same area where a long confrontation situation between the soldiers of the two countries arose this year
 'bharat ko drone ghuspaith ke liye maafee maangani chahie' sheershak se chape akhbaar ke sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, 'yah ghuspaith usee ilaake main hui jahaan kuch samay pehle hi chini ourbhartiya sena kebich takaraav kii sthiti ai thi
 This area is very sensitive and both countries should have avoided adopting any behavior which would again create a conflict
 lekin yah saaf he ki bharat apana vyavhaar main sanyam nahin rakh paa rahaa he
 It is worth mentioning that on this Thursday itself, China had claimed that an Indian drone had 'infiltrated' its air range and had been killed
 china ne bharat ke samaksh aadhikarik rup se is par virodh bhi jataayaa
 While India says that one of his drone routines was on a training expedition, but due to technical flaws, he wandered away and went elsewhere

 Why did they want to come here
 ye koi shikaayat nahin he
 Everyone has their own world ek badi or ek choti si
 In front of everyone with a big ek apni choti si apane saath sirf apane saamne
 The canvas of his world is large
 main bhi apni choti duniya main ji rahaa hoon
 Lived much longer in the big world
 aaj choti duniya main sirf badi duniya main bitaayaa har pal rivoind karata hoon
 Are you not happy, everyone has come to give you such a big honor
 khush? aaj umr ke is padaav par kushi yaa gam kya myne rakhte hai
 Everything is happening as it has always been happening
 sirf chehre hi to alag hai
 i don't know what made me different
 alag kiya bhi to kya paaya
 The end is the ultimate truth
 sthaayee he
 Is unalterable sabhi ko vahi miltaa he
 Do not be disappointed to hear my words
 main bolta nahin hoon ab
 This age has calmed me down
 main khub chillaaya hoon, maine khub josh bharaa he logon main
 My role was the same then
 maine apana role adaa kiya
 Now this is not the peace of the tongue, it is peace of mind
 bol-bol kar kya paaya maine
 Whose life could change
 shaayad sirf apni
 Sometimes i wonder what i would have done if i had not done this in my life
 jab sochataa hoon ki kuch or karata to man khinn sa ho jaataa he
 i wish i could see something else
 lekin thodi hi der main virakti sunn pade sharir main khun kii tarah daud jaati he
 See all the family members are happy
 
 
 
 Yes, now this is my legacy for them
 kuch din baad mujhe nahin pataa hoga ki mujhe kya mila, kya khoyaa, kya rah gaya
 i know that these days i do not recognize the people around me
 lekin ye haalat abhi nahin hui
 Looking at these people throughout his life, he wondered whether i could recognize him
 maine inhen kitna jhootha paaya, maine inhen kitna chhupate paaya
 Today it is becoming difficult to think that they have come for me
 kahin ye bhi kisi raajnneeti kaa hissaa to nahin
 Probably thinking more
 kisi makasad se aaye hon, kya fark padataa he mujhe
 My name also becomes immortal, so what will i know after death? maine dekha he ki jab parivaar main koi bahut boodha ho jaataa he to parivaar vaale uskaa jivan-kaaj manaate hai
 They call people, feed them so that the old person can see his dying ceremony before he dies
 aaj vaisaa hi kuch lag rahaa he
 Can't understand what is hurting you? ye sab thik he apni jagah
 These honors, etc
 lekin main inase kaise kahoon ki mere kuch pachhataave dur kar den
 How do i tell them that in the end you have to come to the small world, do not bring a bundle of regrets with you
 is kamare main mausam nahin badalata
 No companion comes in this room
 aakhir main bas tum hoge or tumhaara aks jo andar baitha he
 There will be hours of talk
 donon main se kisi ko neend nahin aegi
 You will reach that peak from where everyone will start forgetting
 jaise garmi apane charam par pahunchati he or barish ho jaati he
 i then go to zero
 main jaanata hoon, main phir shunya hone vaala hoon
 We struggle so much to reach from cipher to cipher
 dekho, ab bhi ek pal virakt hota hoon or ek pal kuch chaahane lagata hoon
 Now all i really want is the spared end, nothing else

 5
 yah gumaan kabhi mat paaliye ki aap kismat ko haraa sakate hai
 What would have been written in luck would have to be suffered
 6
 Love or hate God, but whatever you do, with full strength and dedication
 7
 The king who wants to win must learn to stay away from greed, otherwise victory is not possible
 8
 The king should not let the small opportunity that he gets to do good for others without being manipulated

 - input language chilchilaati dhoop main elahabaad sthit uttar pradesh lok seva ayog ke get ke baahar alag-alag parikshaon ke intervyuu dene aae abhyarthiyon kii line lagi hui thi
 Anil Kumar Yadav, Secretary of the Commission, sitting amidst tight security inside, spoke for the first time about the questions that have been arising on the activities of the Commission for the last one year, in the conversation with India Today Chief Correspondent Piyush Babelle
 pesh hai baatcheet ke khaas anshmauttar pradesh pisies pariksha 2011 kii obisi category main bade paimaane par yadav chaatro ke kaamyaab hone ke peeche kya koi pakshpaat kiya gaya he?maamla nyaayalay ke vichaaradhin he, isliye tippanee uchit na hogi
 Most Yadav students have got 140 or near numbers, what a coincidence? The functioning of the Commission is completely transparent, the candidates have got marks according to merit
 ise jati yaa dharm ke chashme se dekhnaa galat he
 Anyway, there is no interference from the Chairman or Secretary of the Commission in the selection process
 intervyuu board ko to chaatr kaa role number bhi pataa nahin hota
 But in the last one year, most of the results of the Commission were opposed and in the last year, students came out on the movement
 andolan chaatr nahin kar rahe hai
 This was an uproar at the behest of coaching institutes
 koching nexs ayog ko badnaam karnaa chahta he
 You tell me how many students among the agitators have passed the prelims of PCS
 is baat par bhi gaur kiya janaa chahie ki ab koching chalaane waalon kaa paroksh se paroksh dakhal bhi abhyarthiyon ke chayan main nahin ho paa rahaa, jabaki pehle in koching sansthaanon par pariksha parinaam prabhavit karne ke aarope lagate rahe hai
 In such a situation, these people are spreading unrest under the guise of students
 sawaal sirf intervyuu main zyada number dene kaa nahin, scalling main bhi jati vishesh ke chaatro ko tarjeeh dene ke aarope hai
 The scaling formula is built on the instructions of the Supreme Court
 isamen to data feed karne par apane aap ank aa jate hai
 There is no basis for such allegations
 parinaam itani der main kyon aa rahe hai?ayog ke paas karmchaariyon kii bahut kami he
 In 2003, the Administrative Reforms Commission recommended the creation of 9 new sections and 100 recruits in the Commission, this is yet to be implemented
 1987 ke baad se yahaan nae pad srujit nahin hue hai
 More than 60 of our current staff are also giving competitive examinations themselves, so they have to be kept out of the functioning of the Commission
 is sab ke baavjood pichley ek saal main ayog ne 72 se zyada pariksha parinaam nikaale hai, inamen se kai parinaam to 2004 se latake the
 Wouldn't it be better if you made public the marksheet of the final result of the state's highest exam like PCS so that some sort of concealment can be eliminated? We are bound by our rules
 kisi bhi chaatr kii marksheet uski vyaktigat jaankaree he
 If it is made public, it will be considered a violation of privacy
 safal abhyarthiyon kii suchi saarvajanik kii hi jaati he
 But this final list is fueling all the controversy
 aap yah bhi dekhen ki kis varg ke sabase zyada chaatr pariksha main baith rahe he or prilims yaa mens main safal ho rahe hai
 It should not be surprising if the class where more students participate will be more successful
 ayog ke aane vaale pariksha parinaam vivaadon main nahin ghirenge, isaki ummid
 
 
 The Commission has also been transparent in the past
 iske baavjood kisi ko shaq he to use adaalat jane se koun roak saktaa he

 ye vyakti dehradun isliye panhucha tha kyonki nainital jile kii kosi nadi main ye khanan kar chugaan karnaa chahta tha, jisaki ijaajat sarkaar dwaara isko nahin mili thi
 Before taking this step, this person named Sanjay Bisht had viral a video recorded by him, due to which the police system as well as the state's intelligence system were constantly overlooking, perhaps this is why a Could not be saved from knowing more

 It is okay to help in a fake way: Harish Rawat: Former Chief Minister of the state Harish Rawat also made no mistake in capitalizing on this issue by doing politics, but by supporting both the side and the opposition, he made it clear that for him Prakash Pandey Death is just one issue
 prakaash pandey kaa video jisamen unhone marane se pehle ye bataaya ki kis tarah se mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ke OSD urba dutt bhatta ne unhen farji kagajaat peshkar, farji tareeke se 30 hajaar tak kii madad karne kaa aashwashan diya tha, jo ki ek aparaadh tha
 But Harish Rawat, while talking to Aaj Tak, gave a clean chit to the OSD of the government and said that he tried to help the deceased, at least in a fake way
 iske saath hi unhone apni hi party kii varisht netaa or sadan main netaa pratipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaa raheen indira hridayesh ko bhi clinit de di, lekin prakaash pandey par raajnneeti kar rahe harish ravat shaayad ye bhul gaye ki mritak ne marane pehle ye bhi saaf kar diya tha ki unka sandesh indira hridayesh tak bhi panhucha diya jaae
 So did he meet Indira Hridayesh before coming? Was she incited to suicide by Indira Hridayesh? Was Indira Hridayesh already aware of his move? If this is true, both the opposition and the opposition stand in the dock
 trivendra sarkaar ke liye chunauteeb sawaal uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ke liye he, kyonki unke dwaara yojit janata darbar main hi ek vyakti ne apni jaan de di or usko uksaane vaale uske dwaara is kadam ko badhaane vaale raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 For which Trivendra Singh Rawat needs to bring all criminals to their end, otherwise it is just the beginning for the government
 kahi aisa naa ho ki trivendra singh ravat ke liye mushkilen or bhi bad jaaen

 Apart from this, he also appealed to Harsimrat Badal, Chirag Paswan and Aditya Thackeray to inform the youth of the country about their rights and to vote for them
 kitaab:hindutv kaa mohini mantralekhak:badri narayanaprakashak:raajakmal prakashankimat:400 rupekvarahardboundabadri narayan kii kitaab'hindutv kaa mohini mantra' is shadyantra ko udghaatit karne kii koshish main likhi gai he ki bijepi ke saanskrithik sahyogiyon ne pichley das varshon main badi hi sookshmata se daliton ko apni ore khinchne kii ranneeti taiyaar kii he
 In his book, he has sought to prove by quoting arguments, personal information and historian-sociologists that the sole purpose of institutions like Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Sangh is to connect Dalits with the larger agenda of Hindutva
 taaki unhen musalamaanon ke khilaaf ekajute kiya ja sake or sampradayik dhruvikaran kii sthiti main daliton ko savarna hinduon kii raksha ke liye pesh kiya ja sake
 He has especially blamed the Hindu forces in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar for this polarization and mobilization
 pehle adhyay, bhoomika: ateet or raajnneeti, main ve kehete hai- 'assi ke dashak main hashiyon main simati dalit jatiyaan prajatantric manch par ubharne lageen or satta ke santulan ko chhin-bhinn karne lageen, tab raajnneetik dalon ko bhi apni ranneeti par nae sire se vichaar karnaa padaa'
 Apart from the Sangh and Vishwa Hindu Parishad, he has mainly mentioned the Dalit ideology of two political parties, BSP and BJP
 bahujan samaaj party, jiskaa gathan hi sadiyon se damit, shoshit daliton ke shashaktikaran ke liye hua tha, usne logon main aatmavishvaas bharne ke liye aitihaasik nayakon ko pratik ke rup main chunaa jabaki bijepi ne ramayana or mahabharat jaise granthon se paatr chune
 For example, from Ramayana to Shabri, Nishadraj, Eklavya from Mahabharata, and gradually trying to show their ethnic heroes as avatars of Rama and Lakshmana, they were tortured for centuries by Turks and Mughal invaders, not by Savarna Hindus
 badri narayan likhte hai- 'bijepi ne daliton ke liye vanchit shabd kaa istemaal karnaa chaha he, vanchit ek niraapad shabd he lekin prajatantric raajnneeti ke dabaav main dalit shabd ke prayog se bhi parhez nahin kiya he
 Deprived because they once used to be glorious defenders and protectors of Hindu religion and culture, but were deprived after the infiltration of Muslims in the society
 bijepi kaa ye bhi kahana he ki pichley pantalis varshon main hue dangon main hinduon ke liye ladane vaale or marane vaale adhikansh log aaj kii dalit or pichhadi jatiyon se sambandhit the
 This means that the same people who fought Muslims to protect Hindus were not factually wrong
 dangon main kis varg ke log zyada bhogate hai, yah sarvavidit he, or madhyayugin barbarta bhi nishchay hi isi varg ke logon ne zyada jheli thi
 This is historically an established truth
 've kehete hai ki bijepi ne saanskrithik rashtrawaad ko safal banane ke liye jo ranneetiyaan apanaain ve kargar sabit huin or party ekaek congress kii rashtriya pratidwandvi ban gai
 But gradually when the myth of Ram failed to get votes, the VHP and the Sangh turned towards the caste memories of this vote bank
 ve pramaan dete hai ki uttar pradesh or bihar main musahar jati kii acchhee khaasi aabaadi ko bhunaane ke liye do lokapriy nayakon- dina-bhadri ko ram or lakshmana ke avtaron ke rup main prastut kiya ja rahaa he
 Similarly, Salhas, the hero of the Dusadh caste, is also being described as an incarnation of Lord Rama
 nishadaraaj guhya or shabari ko mahaan dalit pratik banaaya ja rahaa he
 Both Shabri and Nishadraj are associated with Rama
 shabari kaa ram ke prati bhakthibhaav jagajaahir he or ram kii shabari ke prati karunaa bhi anany he
 They believe that the sole purpose of creating pride among Dalits regarding their heroes and ethnic memories is to mobilize them against Muslims
 jabaki ve khud is satya ko sweekaar karte hai khud daliton main apni jaateey smritiyon ke liye gaurav anubhav karne kii ichha balwati hui he
 The myth of Suheldev has been used in Bahraich of Uttar Pradesh
 kitaab main kuch itihaaskaaron kaa zikr he, jinhone daliton kii vanshavali yaa unka itihaas likhaa he
 In this episode, he also discusses some Aryasamajis
 kitaab mehnat se likhi gai he, jisamen tamaam bade samajashastriyon, itihaaskaaron, vichaarkon ko unhone uddhrit kiya he
 The author himself has visited many areas and gathered evidence based on interactions with people
 lekin adhikansh jagahon par drushti ekangi ho gai he
 He has presented the Sangh Parivar moving towards dangerous cultural nationalism, but has missed the rise of Islam as a protective and reactionary force against the fierce form of Islam globally
 ve kehete hai ki baharich main paasi nayak suheldev ke pratik ko puri tarah se sampradayik rang de diya gaya he
 According to Badrinarayan, the Sangh Parivar has been very successful in portraying Suheldev as a heroic Pasi king who killed Muslim Syed Salar Ghazi Mian and liberated people from his terror
 baharich main gaji miyaan kii dargah bhi he, jahaan lakhon hinduon kii aasthaa he
 But by building Suheldev's temple and playing gimmick, the atmosphere there is constantly being spoiled
 haalanki unhone yahaan likhaa he ki baharich jile main madrason kii baadh se hindu sashankit hue hai
 According to the author, the Sangh claims that Ghazi Mian's dargah used to be the ashram of the sage Balark in ancient times
 iske bheetar ke surajkund ko tahasanhas kar diya gaya
 He has given a picture of Suheldev's temple in the book but has not given any picture of the dargah
 itihaas ke mutabik salaar gaji mahmud gazani kaa bhaanja tha
 In the book, there is a lot of mention of spoiling the harmony of the area, but despite being the nephew of Mahmud Ghaznavi, Salar Masood is kept out of the circle of questions
 baharich main madrason kii bharmaar ko bhi unhone bahut hi saadhaakan tareeke se uthaaya he or lagaataar yah sthapit karne kii koshish kii he ki suheldev ke charitra ko bhagava rang main ranga ja rahaa he
 In many places his argument has merit, but in many places there are strange things too
 ve kehete hai ki sangh ne saanskrithik rashtrawaad ko aage badhaane ke liye desh kii jagah raashtra shabd ko prachlit kar diya he
 Now they can be asked that how many people use the word 'rashtra' in Hindi language, which is overwhelmed by the terror of English words
 karte bhi hai to raashtra or desh shabd main antar kya he
 Both are Sanskrit words
 unke mutabik nishadon ke vot paane ke liye sangh or bijepi ne nishadaraaj guhya ko khub mahimamandit kiya he
 The seafarers were earlier incited to car service by citing the relationship between Ram and Nishad Raj, now they are constantly being motivated in a negative sense to come forward to protect Hindu culture
 unki jaateey smritiyon ko do sabhyataaon ke sangharsh main jeevant kiya ja rahaa he
 Citing different parts of Bihar to Uttar Pradesh, he has also believed that people of all castes who always wanted to see themselves with the upper castes, deprived of self-respect, are now rising up but the themes of communalism But as soon as they come, they only blame the Sangh Parivar
 unhen is arth main hindu dharm kii sahishnutaa or viratata kaa anubhav bhi nahin hota ki dina-bhadri or salhes jaise dalit nayakon ko bhi ram kaa avatar kahana sirf yaheen sambhav he
 Because the whole concept of avatar is based on this principle
 hindu dharm main manushya apane jivan main ishwar ke avatar maan liye jate hai or ishwar manushya ke rup main dharti par avatar lete hai
 From here, there is a link between man and God, which connects man to man more easily
 apni baat ko vajandaar banane ke liye lekhak ne hindu samaaj main musalamaanon ke liye prachlit kahawaton, kavitaaon ko uddhrit kiya he
 For example, in the beginning of the chapter 'discovery of the Dalit Army', we quote a saying - 'pig's bar and Turuk's beard are like a hola' lekin ye kahavatein or tamaam kavitaayen sirf is baat ko pramanit karne ke liye likhi gai hai ki sangh or vihip lagaataar in kahawaton ko apane matlab kaa vistaar de rahe hai
 The author has given speeches of BJP leaders, how heroes are being praised in front of them to capitalize on the particular caste
 saanskrithik sroton kii raajnneeti adhyay main ve shuru main vihip netaa or sant swami prapannacharya kaa ek kathan pesh karte hai- 'daliton main ram kisi or rup main paidaa hue hai'
 Is it just communal thinking for the deprived and the exploited caste for centuries to find a hero from their folk and to establish Rama in it? Is this just a conspiracy to free Hindu society from caste-discrimination and varna? The author also has objections as to why such importance is being given to Shabri
 ve kehete hai ki shabari kii katha nesafield kii ramayana main he hi nahin
 Firstly, who reads Nessfield's Ramayana in India, secondly, the story of Shabri is also an irrefutable proof that there was no such thing as caste system in the original soul of Hinduism
 dina-bhadri, shabari, suheldev, eklavya, salhes, phulan devi in tamaam paatro ke jariye unhone daliton ke bhagavakaran ko rekhaankit kiya he
 In the last part of the book, he has written - 'as a sociologist who studies social reality at the village level, it is my duty to reveal the fact that in many regions of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, folk culture is not only full of human emotions but in it Communalism also has some color '
 aage ve kehete hai ki iskaa matlab yah nahin ki gaanv ke log sampradayik hai, balki sabhi samudayik sadbhaav ke saath rahete hai
 The truth under this harmony is that in India, Hindus and Muslims, while living together, come face to face as the bearers of two different cultures
 bhartiya maanas main sadiyon kii gulaami kii kuntha bahut gahari he
 And in the last twenty years, global terrorism, all the terrorist attacks on the country, the overwhelming Islamization of Pakistan and the Kashmir problem have given a constant thrust
 is pustak main uthaai gai baaten vichaarneey to hai lekin ekatarfa hai, jo nishpaksh hokar sampradayikta ke sawaal ko hal nahin karatin
 There is also a lack of honest historiography in those things
 dilli main gayak raahtaphateh ali khanko avaidh rup sevideshi mudrarakhane ke aarope main hiraasat main rakhe jane kii prishthbhumi main pakistan sarkaar ne ghoshnaa kii ki bharat kii yatra par jane se pehle paak abhinaytaon or kalakaaron ko anaapatti pramaan patr hasil karnaa hoga
