 congress ne beshak rohit vemula or jeenyu maamle ko ek bade mudde main badalane kii koshish kii ho lekin sansad main wo donon muddon par pichhadati nazar aa rahi he
 While Mayawati has caught Rohit's case, the Left seems to dominate the JNU issue
 rajyasabha main mayawati ne rohit vemula maamle par shankhanaad kar diya to jeenyu maamle ko lekar left ne aage badhane kii koshish kii
 The Congress, which took these two matters forward and was seen somewhere behind in the House
 yahaan tak ki congress ne donon muddon ke bich pehle fark nahin kiya or phir rajyasabha main mayawati kii maang ke saath khadi nazar aayi
 Ghulam Nabi Azad joined the demand of Mayawati in the Rajya Sabha and said that separate the two issues
 jeenyu par aaj or vemula par kal bahes kara lijie
 On this, the Chair said that the notice will have to be given separately
 phir prakaash jaavdekar ne yaad dilaayaa ki donon muddon par saath bahes kii maang kaa notice dene waalon main khud azaad bhi shaamil hai
 Meaning that Congress has conflated both the issues
 mayawati ko pehle mauqaa le udne ke mudde par bike hariprasad kehete hai ki sansad main sabko saath lekar chalanaa he isliye congress thodi lacheelee hui he
 Be it Hyderabad University or JNU, Rahul Gandhi was among the first to reach
 sadan main maamle uthaane kii baat bhi unhone kii
 But when the opportunity came, why did the party lag behind? mana ja rahaa he ki upi chunaav main congress mayawati ke saath haath milaane kii koshish main juty he isliye dalit mudde par unhen aage badhane diya
 Congress MP Hanumantha Rao says that Mayawati is a woman, she was a Chief Minister, so let her raise the issue first
 jabaki congress ke hi piel punia safai dete hai ki sansadeey vyavastha main notice diya jaataa he
 He who gave first took it away
 lekin rahul anyaay ke kilaaf sabase pehle khadey hai
 The comments udhar loksabhaa main bijepi ne badi safai se jeenyu maamle ko sidhe rashtrawaad se jod kar rahul gandhi par jam kar prahaar kiye
 Sources reveal that the Congress was afraid that it might have to suffer loss on the issue of nationalism
 lekin rajeev shukla ise nahin maanate
 They say the Congress stands with the issue, who does not matter first or later, the Congress is at the forefront of nationalism
 jeenyu maamle main jo doshi hon unke pakadaa jaae nirdosh ko na fansaaya jaae
 However, Jyotiraditya Scindia tried to separate the attack on nationalism and the image of the entire JNU
 lekin bijepi ne apane netaaon se jeenyu maamle par aakraamak rahane kaa farmaan jari kiya he
 In such a situation, the experts believe that the Congress advocating freedom of expression does not appear to be the opposite of nationalism, so it is better to put your hand a little back
 jab anuraag thakur rahul gandhi par sidhe prahaar kar rahe the tab rahul kaa kuch na bolnaa bhi party ke hit ke viruddh gaya
 In the Rajya Sabha, Mayawati raised the issue on the Rohit Vemula case, while Left tried to move forward on the JNU case
 in donon maamalon ko aage bad kar haath main lene vaali congress sadan main kahin peeche khadi nazar aayi
 Even the Congress did not differentiate between the two issues first and then stood in the Rajya Sabha with Mayawati's demand
 ghulaam nabi azaad ne rajyasabha main mayawati kii maang se maang milaate hue kaha ki donon muddon ko alag kar dijie
 Get JNU debated today and Vemula tomorrow
 is par chair ne kaha ki notice alag-alag dena hoga
 Then Prakash Javadekar reminded that those who gave notice of the demand for debate on both the issues themselves are also free
 matlab congress ne hi donon muddon kaa ghalmail kar diya
 On the issue of taking Mayawati for the first time, BK Hariprasad says that everyone has to take along with them in the Parliament, so the Congress is a bit flexible
 hyderabad uniwarsity ho yaa jeenyu sabase pehle pahunchane waalon main rahul gandhi rahe
 He also talked about raising matters in the House
 lekin jab mauqaa aayaa to party kyon peeche rah gai? It is believed that the Congress is trying to join hands with Mayawati in the UP elections, so let them move on the Dalit issue
 congress saansad hanumant raav kaa kahana he ki mayawati mahila hai, cheef ministar thim isliye ye mudda pehle unhen uthaane diya
 While PL Punia of Congress only clarifies that notice is given in the parliamentary system
 jisane pehle de diya usne uthaa liya
 But Rahul is the first to stand against injustice
 tippaniyan On the other hand, in the Lok Sabha, the BJP very clearly attacked Rahul Gandhi by directly linking the JNU case with nationalism
 sutara bataate hai ki congress ko isi baat kaa dar tha ki use kahin rashtrawaad ke mudde par nuksaan na uthaanaa pad jaae
 But Rajiv Shukla does not believe it
 ve kehete hai congress mudde ke saath khadi he, koun pehle koun baad main isse fark nahin padataa, rashtrawaad kaa sawaal he to congress sabase aage he
 Those who are guilty in the JNU case should be caught and the innocent should not be implicated
 haalanki jyotiraditya sindhiya ne rashtrawaad or puure jeenyu kii chhavi par prahaar ko alag karne kii koshishi kii
 But the BJP has issued an order asking its leaders to be aggressive on the JNU case
 aise main jaankaar maanate hai ki abhivyakti kii azaadi kii vakaalat karti congress kahin rashtrawaad ke ulat na dikhe isliye usne apana haath thodaa peeche rakhana hi behatar samajha
 When Anurag Thakur was attacking Rahul Gandhi directly, Rahul's not saying anything also went against the party's interest
 ghulaam nabi azaad ne rajyasabha main mayawati kii maang se maang milaate hue kaha ki donon muddon ko alag kar dijie
 Get JNU debated today and Vemula tomorrow
 is par chair ne kaha ki notice alag-alag dena hoga

 teen dinon se dharne par baithe ditisi ke asthaayee karmchaariyon se mangalvaar shaam mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal achaanak milane pahunche
 Kejriwal tried to persuade him, promising, even giving written assurance
 vaadon or aashwaasano se ajiz aa chuke ditisi ke asthaayee karmchaariyon ne apana andolan waapas lene se inkaar kar diya

 The manner in which Kejriwal put a series of assurances during and after the elections to regularize the temporary employees, is becoming a bone of the throat of the government somewhere

 Residents of Delhi are facing the brunt of the weather on Thursday, 27 June
 taapmaana 40 degree celsius ke aasapaas bana hua he
 The presence of humid in the air, scorching sun and heat makes the weather feel uncomfortable
 dilli or aasapaas ke ilaakon main monsoon-purv gatividhiyaan bhi behad kam hui hai
 The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted thunderstorms for the last three days, but this did not happen
 dilliwaale bas aasmaan kii taraf nihaarte hi rah gaye, par badalon kii athkheliyon ke sivaa kuch hasil na hua
 According to weather forecasting agency Skymet, there has been a 38 per cent decrease in rainfall in Delhi during the pre-monsoon season (march-may)
 haalanki
 The onset of monsoon dates to June 30 in Delhi, but earlier pre-monsoon activities took place, which provided some relief to Delhiites
 lekin is saal june maheene ke aakhir tak indra devtaa ne dilliwaalon ko koi raahat nahin bakshi he
 Skymet figures show that as of June 27, 47 in Delhi generally
 2 fisadi barish hoti he lekin is saal mahaz 6
 There has been 3 percent rainfall, which is 87 percent less than normal
 chunki monsoon is baar kerala main bhi der se aayaa he aise main mausam vaigyanikon kii raay he ki monsoon ke dilli aagaman main bhi deree hogi
 According to Skymet, the monsoon can reach Delhi by 6 July
 scymet ke mutabik, kerala main monsoon ke der se pahunchane ke saath hi, chakravaat vaayu ne bhi isaki raftaar roki he
 Along with this, the southwest winds running in the interior of the peninsula also changed their direction due to cyclonic wind
 scymet ke mutabik, dakshini prayadwipiya hisse main monsoon kii sthirataa ke kaaran isaki pragati main deree hui he
 And the low pressure areas in the Bay of Bengal also blocked the path of monsoon
 idhar, mumbai main bhi monsoon puure pakhwaade bhar der he
 But if we talk about the whole country, then the whole month of June is proving to be very weak in terms of monsoon and rain
 iemdi ke aankadon ke mutabik, 19 june tak desh main 43 fisadi kam barish hui thi
 But as per the current figures (till 27 June), according to the weather agency Skymet, this reduction in the amount of rain across the country is about 36 percent
 desh bhar main abhi tak 86
 It has received 3 mm of rain while 135 in this period
 6 mimi hona chahie tha
 According to Skymet, in the current scenario, the next three days of the month of June are also going to be similar
 aise main lag rahaa he ki is baar barish kii maatra kam hone kaa scymet kaa anumaan sahi sabit hoga
 According to Skymet, after so little rain in June, the rain in the following months could hardly make up for it
 agency ke anusaar, 1873 se hi, yani pichley 148 saal main, jis bhi saal june maheene main barish kii maatra main 30 fisadi se adhik kii kami hui he, to desh main yaa monsoon saamaanya se kam rahaa he yaa phir desh ko bhayaavah sookhaa jhelana padaa he
 Only in 1923 and 1924, monsoon was normal under these conditions and in 1926 rainfall was more than normal
 pichley ek dashak main saal 2009 main june main 52 fisadi kam barish hui thi or iskaa nateeja ghor sookhe ke rup main saamne aayaa tha
 In 2012 too, there was 30 per cent less rainfall in the month of June and the results showed less than normal monsoon
 mausam vaigyanik is durbal monsoon ke peeche al nino kaa haath bataa rahe hai

 a tax of 1 lakh 20 thousand 120 rupees was made on this
 ab standard didction kii limit badhane par 1 lakh 17 hajaar rupee kaa tex lagegaa
 It will save Rs 3,120
 50 lakh se 1 karod rupee tak kii inakamajinaki inakam 50 lakh rupee se zyada he, unako 3,432 rupee kii bachat hogi
 Those whose income is more than Rs 1 crore, they will get a profit of Rs 3,588

 Probably many things would have been removed during the film's cutting sort after being engulfed in controversies, due to which the final cut seems to be scattered
 box offis :film kaa bajet kam he
 However, it is difficult to get viewers due to lack of buzz

 This morning at 9 am, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav called Mulayam Singh Yadav and asked for an appointment
 mulaayam singh ne akhilesh ko lakhanu ke awaas par milane ke liye bulaayaa
 Mulayam Singh arrived at his residence from Delhi to Lucknow at around 11
30 pm and Akhilesh Yadav arrived at his house at one o'clock
 ek ghante tak donon netaaon ke bich baatcheet hui
 If sources are to be believed, Akhilesh told Netaji that he does not want to become the party president
 mulaayam singh hi adhyaksh bane rahe lekin unhen ummidavaaron ko tikat baantne kaa adhikaar mili
 Akhilesh Yadav asked Mulayam Singh that i should be made the state president of Double Party
 shivpal singh kii bhoomika par akhilesh ne netaji ke saamne prastaav rakhaa ki wo hamaare star prachaarak hon lekin chunaav main unka dakhal naa rahe
 At the same time, Akhilesh told Mulayam that action should be taken against Amar Singh in the same manner as Ram Gopal Yadav was acted upon
 saath hi unhone shivpal yadav ko rajya kii raajnneeti se baahar kar centre kii raajnneeti main bhejne kii baat bhi kahi
 On the proposal of CM Akhilesh, Mulayam Singh invited Shivpal to his residence to get his consent
 shivpal bhi sidhe dilli se mulaayam singh ke ghar pahunche
 There Shivpal agreed on many things about Akhilesh but he is not ready to withdraw from UP politics
 unhone mulaayam singh se kaha ki wo ramgopal yadav kii vajah se dilli kii raajnneeti main nahin janaa chaahate
 At the moment, talks have broken down again on this agreement
 lekin abhi ummid baaki he
 However, Akhilesh supporters have called the meeting with Mulayam merely as a courtesy
 isaki vajah akhilesh kii chhavi ko bachaae rakhana he
 The Akhilesh camp does not want to upset the image of Akhilesh who bypasses the old socialist Mulayam
 aaj kii sulah kii meeting main un logon ne apni bhoomika nibhaai he jo akhilesh virdohi maane ja rahe hai
 Among those who convinced Mulayam were Gayatri Prajapati, Om Prakash Singh, Narada Roy and Balaram Yadav, who are close to Netaji and Shivpal, but now all have to try to find a formula after the threat of the party's election symbol being seized
 lekin siem akhilesh yadav kisi surat main baikfoot par dikhnaa nahin chaahate
 Azam Khan also spoke to Mulayam on behalf of Akhilesh faction
 ajam ne kaha ki netaji se bahut sehatmand baatcheet hui he or samvaad kaa ek rasta bana he
 He said that Netaji is soft, it is a good thing
 saath hi kanfusion kii raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 Azam Khan has also become the architect of Suhak in father-son earlier
 aise main unhone kaha he ki achche kaam ke liye kahin bhi ja saktaa hum ham chaahate hai ki sab ek ho jaaen muslim varg is vivaad se bahut pareshaan hai isliye is vivaad ko sulajhana chahie

 Special bath on Shatilaila Ekadashi - Take a pledge before bathing in the morning or evening - First apply water on your head, then start bathing - Put on clean clothes and put water on the mole Offer arya - then chant and donate Shri Hari Kemantra - Mantra will be: Om Namobhagavate Vasudevaya Swaha- It would be best to fast on this day by consuming water and fruits
 Light a lamp - then offer Srihari to Sesame dishes - chant Srihari Kantra as per your wish - Eat the offerings of sesame yourself and share it with people
 Tenvase those who do not fast this Ekadashi, they can also get good fruit in this fast
 bas ekadshi ke din bhojan or jeevancharya satvik rakhni hogi

 tii-twanti world cap main team india kii lutiyaa kyon dubi
 
 ? captain mahendra singh dhoni ne jab iske liye ipel kii let nite party ko jimmedaar bataaya, to bisisiai or ipel ke ohadedaar un par pil pade
 But, now the truth is uncovered, it says that Dhoni has said exactly that
 ipel party ke dauraan sharaab or shabaab main duubakar khilaadiyon ne team india kaa bedaa gark kar diya
 Not only this, the news even came that girls used to go in the players' room
 ek khilaadi ne hi pole khol diya he ki dhoni ne kuch bhi galat nahin kaha
 The pressure was not right for the IPL party, but the situation was made such that the players' footsteps would automatically reach the party hall itself
 ipel main khel chuke us gumnaam khilaadi ke hawaale se ek akhbaar main jo khabar chhapi he, wo behad sansanikhez he
 According to that player, the routine of all IPL parties was the same
 35 se 45 minute tak fishan sho chalata tha or phir ramp se utar kar modells party main aae logon ke saath ghul-mil jaati thim
 Apart from the models there used to be cheerleaders and other girls, which we call escort service
 party main glamer gholne ke liye khubasurat mahilaayein thim or party paravaan chadhane lagati thi
 He was not allowed to talk to any player for more than five minutes
 agar wo paanch minute se zyaada baat karatin, to ek manager unhen vahaan se hataa detaa
 However, not all players were kept away from women in these parties
 us gumnaam khilaadi ke mutabik, jo namchin khilaadi the, unhen khubasurat mahilaon ke saath rahane se koi nahin roktaa tha
 They lived, chatted, spilled jams and had fun
 kabhi-kabhi to hotel ke kamare main bhi
 This disclosure of the presence of girls in the players' rooms is very sensational
 in partiyon ke gavaah rahe jis khilaadi ne ye pole kholi he, usne khilaadiyon kii majaburi bhi bataai ki aakhir kyon khilaadi in partiyon main jate the
 Often IPL officials, sponsors or owners of teams used to tell the players that if they come to the party for some time, it will be good
 vahaan kuch log tumse milanaa chahenge
 i was not Rahul Dravid or Tendulkar to say that i will not come
 aksar khilaadi sochate the ki party main ghante bhar ke liye chale jaaenge
 But, after going there, before 4 pm there was no need to return to the hotel room
 under-19 or under-22 players ke liye to party ajooba hi thi
 The new players had never seen Bollywood stars, page-three personalities, free expensive cigarettes and alcohol, sometimes even drugs and so many beauties
 jo cigarette-sharaab nahin pite, wo bhi ipel party ke kool gang main shaamil ho jate the
 Now obviously when IPL officials and team owners are asking to come to the party, then how many cricketers would be able to keep themselves away from this beauty? That too when the party is being held at the team hotel
 in partiyon main shaamil hone vaale khilaadiyon kaa kya haal hota hoga, iskaa andaaza aap laga sakate hai ki unhen der shaam tak match khelnaa hota tha
 Then party till 4 in the morning
 party se lautne ke baad unhen agle match ke liye apana saamaan pack karke taiyaar hona hota tha, taaki samay se flite pakad saken

 Please tell that for the past several days, the doctors were on strike
 somvaar mukhyamantri mamata banerjee kii ore se doctoron kii maang maan liye jane ke baad doctoron ne hadtaal samaapt kar diya
 The Ahmedabad Medical Association also joined the protest against doctors and all the senior doctors kept their hospitals closed
 doctoron ke saath ho rahe hamale kaa virodh kiya or doctor ko suraksha muhaiyaa karaae jane ke maang kii
 Also demanded strict legislation to prevent such attacks on working doctors
 ahmedabad ke ek senior doctor ne kaha ki doctoron ke saath marpet ho rahi he
 An intern doctor was killed in Bengal
 gundon ne hostel par atake kiya, ladakiyon par acid phenkaa, aisi hi ghatnaayen har roj desh main ek se do doctoron par ho rahi he
 The doctor saves people and now this is happening to the doctor
 aisa hi rahaa to doctor apane kaam jimmedaari ke saath nahin kar paaenge isliye ye sab band hona chahie
 At the same time, senior doctors say that we have kept our demand in front of the government many times, but the government never accepted our demand, so this time we have made a strong and strict law against those who attack doctors
 aisa kanoon bane kii hamalaa karne waalon ko 7 se 14 saal tak kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan ho or unhen jamaanat tak na di jaae
 Significantly, the Supreme Court will hear a petition seeking protection of doctors in government hospitals today
 bataa den ki pashchim bengal main doctoron ke pradarshan ke baad shuukravaar ko yah yachika daayar kii gai thi
 Seeing the popularity of the film 'bahubali', a thali in a hotel in Gujarat is named after 'bahubali'
 bahubali kii team philhal film ke pramotion main biji he or shahar bhar main apni film ke liye gum rahe hai
 In such a situation, the team faced a special thing
 ahmedabad ke hotel rajvadu main ek thali kaa naam 'bahubali' rakhaa gaya he
 'baahubali 2' to be released, will be released on 6500 screens in India
 Rajesh Patel, owner of Hotel Rajwadu and Manish Patel are very big fans of the film 'bahubali' and they have seen the first part of the film many times
 isliye vah bahubali jaisi megabajet film ko puraa sammaan dena chaahate the
 The two brothers took this unique step and, after showing the grandeur of the 'bahubali' franchise, named a Thali in their hotel as 'bahubali Thali' after the film
 Shocking: to kya in do rajyon main relies nahin hogi 'bahubali 2'ahmedabad sthit hotel rajvadu gaanv par aadhaarit theme ke liye janaa jaataa he jo ki chaaron ore hariyaali se bhi ghira hua he
 The hotel is famous for its Gujarati and Rajasthani food
 khaas taur par bhartiya tourist or vishesh rup se videshi nagarikon ke bich behad lokapriy he
 This plate of 'bahubali' shows the grandeur of food and the life of Rajwadu
 thali main bahubali ke jhagade se prerit anek vyanjanon ke swaadon kaa yuddh mila hua he
 'baahubali' Prabhas is a bigger superstar than Salman, in the proof film here, 'why Kattapa killed Baahubali', the whole social media is talking about it, but the owners of Hotel Rajwadu Rajesh and Manish Patel are also from the film's team
 Very excited to ask the question
 hotel rajvadu ke maalikon kaa kahana he ki donon hi film ke duusare part ko dekhne ke liye bahut utsuk hai or puri family ke saath 'bahubali' kaa first de first sho dekhne jaaenge
 The reason for making 'bahubali' in two parts was revealed
 ARKA Entertainment is producing the film 'bahubali'
 es es rajamauli nirdeshit film main rana daggubaati, tamanna bhaatia, anoushka shetty or satyaraj lead role main najar aaenge film main prabhas ko unke phens ek ahm bhoomika nibhaate dikhaai denge

 Another witness in this case is overturned by his statement

 What was the case? Let me tell you that Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife had an encounter in November 2005
 is maamle kii jaanch or sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne kaha tha ki gujarat main is cese kii jaanch ko prabhavit kiya ja rahaa tha or cese ko 2012 main mumbai transfar kar kaha tha ki is maamle kii shuru se ant tak sunwaayee ek hi jaj karegaa
 However, in 2014, Judge Jetty Utpat was transferred
 utpat ke baad is cese main jaj brijagopal loya ko laayaa gaya
 Six months after his appointment, Loya died in an event in Nagpur
 jisapar kaaphi vivaad hua tha
 Recently, the Bombay High Court lifted the ban on media reporting in the Sohrabuddin encounter case
 media kii reporting par bain nichali adaalat ne 29 november ke apane aadesh main lagaaya tha
 The magazine's report had raised questions
 Some time ago a magazine claimed in its report that Justice Loya's death was not simple but suspicious
 jiske baad se hi yah maamla dobaaraa charchaa main aayaa
 Political rhetoric has also continued on this issue
 haalanki, jaj loya ke bete anuj loya ne kuch din pehle hi press conference kar is mudde ko bada karne par naaraazgi jataai thi
 Anuj had said that his father's death was natural, he does not want to let the issue escalate

 how about you make a dress instead that would fit the bride's size wouldn't that be easier Falguni
 And, what on earth do you mean by fat women should wear high necks and Flaired skirts, and not fitted clothes
 
 i mean your idea to dress a fat bride is to put her in a sack
 Disgraceful
 
 You and designers like you are toxic
 Filling young mind’s with fake idea of what beauty is
 Ugh !! Let women and men be
 Everyone is beautiful
 
 Be it a size 2 or or size 22
 
 everyone is gorgeous
 And everyone has the right to wear and dress and buy the clothes that they'd like

 Both of them have got a chance in both T20 and odis and the time has come for both of them to show their power with the bat now, otherwise both of them will remain as players of the shorter format

 Saloni and Ghulam, who hail from the neighboring state of Maharashtra, from Nagpur city, say that at first they thought that this relationship should be kept hidden
 lekin jab unhone himmat kar isaki jaankaree apane parivaar waalon ko di tab vah iske khilaaf ho gaye
 When in the year 2014, the Supreme Court recognized the eunuchs as the third gender and ensured constitutional rights and independence for them, they decided to live together
 iske baad unhone apane gharon ko chhod diya

 Also Rajput says that from childhood we saw that there was a pair of mother and father, brother and sister-in-law, sister and brother-in-law
 lekin kinnaron ko parivaar kaa upekshit hissaa mana jaataa tha or koi bhi unki jodi ke bare main nahin sochataa tha

 Excited about the formation of the government, Shivsinashrad Pawar did not say any clear thing, the government is not just our responsibility - suspense still remains on the formation of government in Rautam Maharashtra
 rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ke pramukh sharad pavaar somvaar ko jab congress kii antarim adhyaksh sonia gandhi se milane 10 janpath pahunche to laga ki aaj shaayad maharashtra kaa gatirodh khatm ho jaae
 But after the meeting with Sonia Gandhi, in a press conference, Sharad Pawar in a way drowned the Shiv Sena's expectations that now the government will be formed
 shivasena ke rajyasabha saansad sanjay raut lagaataar sarkaar gathit kiye jane kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 He has said, "we will prove a majority with a figure of 170 mlas in the House
" sharad pavaar anbhavi hai, wo sarkaar chaahate hai
 So their experience will work
 sharad pavaar ko lekar hamaare man ko koi sanshay nahin hai
 Together with NCP and Congress, we will run the government for the next five years
 'sonia gandhi se meeting ke baad sharad pavaar ne kaha ki congress or ensipi ke netaa halaat kaa jayja lene ke alaava donon partiyon ke netaaon se baatcheet karenge
 Till now there was no discussion about government formation
 hamane anya muddon par baatcheet nahin kii
 We will keep an eye on the situation
 sabhi netaaon kii raay lene ke baad hi aage kaa rasta tay karenge
 Sharad Pawar also said that the Swabhimani Shetkari organization is also with us
 unke vidhayak jite hai
 We also cannot circumvent them
 pavaar ne kaha, ham sabhi dalon ko bharose main lenge
 Concern for Shiv Sena! Sharad Pawar, who is considered a clever player in politics, will cheat Shiv Sena with his 'googly' excited about the formation of government? The Shiv Sena, which is dreaming of forming a government with the NCP, Congress, may have been aggravated after Sharad Pawar's meeting with Sonia Gandhi
 shivasena kii yah chintaa dilli main der shaam sharad pavaar se mulaakaat ke baat sanjay raut kii baton main saaf najar ai
 After meeting Sharad Pawar, Sanjay Raut said that it is not just our responsibility to form the government
 jinaki jimmedaari he wo (bijepi) pehle hi usase dur bhaag gaye
 But i am confident that we will form the government soon
 dilachasp baat yah he ki ensipi or congress, shivasena se sarkaar ko lekar baat kar rahi hai lekin sonia se mulaakaat se pehle hi sharad pavaar ne kah diya tha ki bhartiya janata party or shivasena ne saath milakar chunaav ladaa tha or ab unhen apane raste chunane honge
 The sena-ncp-congress, which came close, contested the assembly elections held on October 21 by the kjjp-shiv Sena alliance
 24 oktober ko aae nateezon ke mutabik 288 siton main se bijepi 105 seat jitkar sabase badi party bani, jabaki shivasena 56 siten jeet pai thi
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray sought the post of Chief Minister for a half-term in five years, which the BJP rejected and the alliance broke
 bijepi ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne istipha de diya jiske baad rajyapal ne shivasena or phir ensipi se poocha ki kya ve sarkaar bana sakate hai yaa nahin
 But when no letter came, the Governor recommended the imposition of President's rule
 is samay maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan lagu he
 Ramdas Athawale's formula Meanwhile, on Monday, Ramdas Athawale, minister in the Narendra Modi government at the Center, suggested another new formula for formation of the government to Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut
 news agency eenai ke mutabik athavle ne bataaya, maine sanjay raut se baat kii or unhen 3 or 2 saal kaa formula sujhaayaa
 Under this, the BJP will have three years of Chief Minister and 2 years of Shiv Sena
 ramdaas athavle ke mutabik sanjay raut ne kaha ki agar bijepi is par hami bharti he to shivasena vichaar kar sakati he
 Athawale said that he would talk to BJP about this
 baharhaal, in sab siyaasi ghatnakramon ke bich sharad pavaar or congress ke rukh se siyaasi game thodaa pechida ho chalaa he
 Now it has become a little difficult to understand what is going on in Sharad Pawar's heart
 apane vivaadaaspad bayanon ko lekar aksar charchaa main rahane vaale upi sarkaar main cabinet mantri om prakaash rajbhar ne ek baar phir se betuka bayaan diya he
 Cabinet Minister Om Prakash Rajbhar has said that he will make the parents who are not sending their children to school starved and thirsty in the police station for five days
 pradesh ke divyang evam pichhadaa varg kalyaan mantri rajbhar ne rasda kasbe ke gandhi maidan main kal yojit party ke ek kaarykram kaha, ‘‘main apane man kaa kanoon banane vaala hum
 i will sit in the police station of the poor whose child will not go to school for five days
 naa pani pine duungaa or naa hi khaanaa khaane duungaa
 "he said," If you people (children) do not send to school, you will be taken up and taken to the police station
 
 
 
 This is the reason that i am saying, look at your leader, your son, your brother was explaining you
 aapane agar meri baat nahin maani, to chah maheene or manaauungaa
 "rajbhar said," Lord Rama had celebrated the sea for three days, when he did not believe, the Lord had to take up arms and the sea started to go trihimam-trihimam
 usee tarah jis bhi garib kaa baccha vidhyalay nahin jayega, chah maheene ke baad usethane main pahunchaa duungaa, chaahe bhale hi mujhe faansee kyon naa ho jaae
 "he then raised the hand of the crowd present and asked," There is no wrong thing
 kitne log iske samarthan main hai?’’ is par anek mahilaon ne haath uthaakar sahmati jataayi

 Input: IANS patna hai court dwaara sharabbandi kanoon ko nirast kiye jane ke baad aakhirkaar bihar sarkaar ne ravivaar se bihar main nayaa sharabbandi kanoon lagu kar diy
 Notification was issued after Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's Cabinet approved the Bihar Alcohol Prohibition and Excise Act 2016 to be implemented in Bihar
 cabinet kii baithak main bihar ko sharabmukt rajya banane kaa sankalp bhi liya
 Not only this, the government also decided to go to the Supreme Court against the decision of the High Court
 nitish kumaar ne cabinet kii baithak ke baad press conference main kaha ki sarkaar bihar kosharabamuktabanane ke liye patibaddh he
 This is the reason that the new law Bihar Prohibition and Excise Bill 2016 has been enacted with immediate effect on the auspicious occasion of Gandhi Jayanti
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki is kanoon ko vidhanmandal ne 4 agast ko paarit kiya or 7 sitambar ko rajyapal kaa anumodan bhi is kanoon ko mila
 On 14 September, the cabinet decided that this law will be implemented on 2 October, so the decision of the High Court is not affected by this new law
 yah bilkulanaya kanoonhai
 He said that there is prohibition of liquor in Bihar for the last 6 months, so its effect is also visible
 log aarope lagaate he ki sarkaar ko 5 hajaar crores ke rajasav kii haani ho rahi he, lekin janata kaa 10 hajaar karod rupee sharabbandi se batch rahaa he
 The effect of prohibition is beginning to be seen in villages and cities, people's living standards are improving
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki keval kanoon ke jariye sharabbandi ko lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa he, isliye ham ise jan chetana ke jariye saamaajik parivartan laana chaahate hai
 1 crore 19 lakh people of different schools have signed and resolved that they will not drink alcohol
 9 lakh jagahon par naare likhe gaye
 Keeping this public consciousness in mind, it has been implemented on the occasion of Abangandhi Jayanti
 yah varsh gandhiji ke champaran yatra kaa 100waan varsh bhi he
 This is a true tribute to Gandhiji on behalf of us
 'vipaksh kii salaah par bhi vichaar'nitish kumaar ne kaha ki bihar me pehle 1915, 1938 ke sharabbandi ke act ko sanshodhit kar banaae gaye kanoon ke jariye 5 april se sharabbandi lagu kii gai thi, lekin yah act bilkul nayaa he
 He said that the decision of the High Court is not final
 sarkaar is faisle ke khilaaf supreme court jaaegi, taaki us act ke jariye liye gaye faisle ko sarkaar lagu karvaa sake
 He challenged that if the opposition feels that liquor ban can be done without enacting a strict law, then he should give some concrete suggestions
 sarkaar is par vichaar karegi
 He also said that every law is amended, it will also be done if needed
 nitish kumaar ne gopalganj main hue jahrili sharaab par charchaa karte hue kaha ki us ghatana main mare logon ko chaar lakh kaa muaavja diya gaya, lekin wo sarkaar nahin de rahi he, balki unase vasula jayega jinaki vajah se yah ghatana hui he
 Completely committed to prohibition of liquor: On Thursday, the High Court of Bihar was repealed by the Patna High Court
 court ne paanch april ko sarkaar dwaara jari adhisuchana ko radd kar diya tha
 Since then, the fragrance of implementing the new law in the state was intensified
 aise main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar pehle se hi nae sharabbandi kanoon ko 2 oktober se lagu karne kii ghoshnaa kar chuke the
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has taken this step, stating himself fully committed to complete prohibition in Bihar
 bihar madh nishedh or utpaada adhinium 2016 ko pichley monsoon satr main hi vidhanmandal ke donon sadanon se manjuuri mili thi, uske baad rajyapal ne bhi is kanoon par apni sahmati jataa chuke hai
 The Bihar Liquor Prohibition and Excise Act 2016 has come into force in Bihar with immediate effect
 sajaa ke saath jurmaana bhibihar madh nishedh or utpaada adhinium 2016 main sharabbandi ko lekar kade kanoon banaae gaye hai
 The new law provides that if a person is caught in a house drinking alcohol and being allowed to drink alcohol, there is a provision of at least five years and a maximum sentence of seven years
 aisi sthiti main kam se kam ek lakh rupee or adhik se adhik das lakh rupee tak kaa jurmaana bhi ho saktaa he
 The provision of stricter punishment The new rule provides that if a person uses women or children below 18 years of age to smuggle liquor, then he can be sentenced to a minimum of ten years and maximum life imprisonment

 If a bottle of liquor is recovered from someone's house, then in such a situation, information has to be given on how to bring liquor to the house
 If the information is not given, the owner of the house is punished for a minimum of eight years in the new prohibition law
 agar kisi gaanv main sharaab par pratibandh nahin lag paa rahaa he to waisi sthiti main us jile ke jiladhikari ko yah shakti is nae kanoon main di gai he kii wo us gaanv par samuhik jurmaana laga saktaa he

 (from input language) (input bhashaa se) The North MCD, which is going through the economic crisis, has ordered the release of funds of Rs 50 crore giving partial relief to the contractors of the corporation
 darasal, north emsidi kaa nigam ke thekedaaron par vikaas kaaryon kaa karodon rupee bakaayaa he, lekin aarthik badahaali jhel rahi northemsidike paas jab apane staff ko hi samay par selary dene ke liye paisa nahin he, to bhala wo thekedaaron kaa bhugtan kaise karegi
 Due to the economic crisis, the North MCD had for a long time stopped the money being paid to contractors for development works
 guuruuvaar ko nigam ke thekedaaron kaa ek samooh northemsidimen sthaayee samiti adhyaksh tilak raaj kataaria se mila or unhen apni samasyaon se avgat karaayaa
 Kataria was also present at the meeting along with corporation officials
 is baithak main kataaria ne nigam thekedaaron ko 50 karod rupee jari karne ke aadesh die
 Kataria said that in view of the corporation's poor financial condition, funds had not been released to contractors for a long time to pay for the work done by them
 kataaria ne sabhi thekedaaron ko bharosa dilaayaa ki unke dwaara kiye gaye vikaas kaaryon kii bhugtan raashi jald se jald unhen di jaaegi
 The contractors said that while agreeing to release Rs 50 crore from the minor relief corporation, the contractors have expressed happiness, but this amount is said to be only minor relief
 thekedaaron ke mutabik nigam par unke kareeb 450 karod rupee bakaayaa hai
 In such a situation, a sum of Rs 50 crore is like cumin in the camel's mouth
 haalanki thekedaaron ne yah bhi mana ki rakam bhale hi kam he, lekin wo koshish karenge ki iskaa asar vikaas kaaryon par na pade

 Opponent parties say that Babur sinned by building a mosque, but he did not commit any sin

 By the time the car was lifted, we were both screaming for help
 ’ unhone kaha ki agar choton kaa kaaran durghatana hoti, to kya ve madad ke liye pukaar lagane kii sthiti main hote

 Even after being sentenced in the fodder scam against Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) President Lalu Prasad and going to jail, there are many people whose allegiance to him is not digested and they are not ready to blame Lalu

 At the same time, according to Indian Express, the workers in the video are allegedly telling the youth that they were eating buffalo meat

 After the results of the by-elections, there has been a furore over the seat-sharing in Bihar among all allies including the nda's JDU
 raajnneetik ghatnakram ke bich modi sarkaar ke chaar saal puure hone ke uplakshya main bijepi ne endie ke apane sabhi sagayogi dalon ko aaj shaam patna aamantrit kiya he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar at this meeting and dinner
 lokjanshkti party or rashtriya lok samta party ke pramukh samet kareeb 1000 netaa shaamil honge
 This is the first time NDA leaders are meeting in Bihar after forming a government with BJP-JDUK
 iskaa mukhya makasad aapasi ekajutata dikhaanaa he
 bjp's Bhupendra Yadav, including Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha, Deputy CM Sushil Modi, BJP state president Nityanand Rai, Arun Kumar, including all mps, mlas, Legislative Councilors, state officials and District President of all constituent parties Mahaboja
 Will join bataa den ki 2013 main nitish kumaar bijepi se alag ho gaye the phir july 2017 main bihar main endie kii sarkaar bani
 There is a stir in the political corridor regarding this meeting of the NDA that is taking place after years
 khaskar upachunaav main endie ke kharaab pradarshan ko dekhte hue is aayojan kaa mahatv bad gaya he
 Before the meeting, JDU declared Nitish Kumar the face of NDA
 haalanki isko lekar bijepi or anya sahyogi dalon ne bhi mana ki bihar kaa cheharaa nitish kumaar he or desh kaa cheharaa narendra modi hai
 JDU national general secretary KC Tyagi said BJP should take advantage of Nitish's national image
 unka maananaa he isse endie ko deshbhar main phayda hoga
 Significantly, in the 2019 elections, the split between the seats of NDA in Bihar seems to be stuck
 nitish kumaar ko dar sata rahaa he ki unhen bijepi senior partner ke rup main sweekaar karegi yaa nahin
 In 2009, BJP and JDU contested the Lok Sabha elections together
 us samay main jediu 25 siton par or bijepi ne 15 par chunaav ladaa tha
 In 2014, the BJP and JDU split and the NDA had 31 out of 40 seats in the Modi wave
 ab phir donon dal ek hai
 In such a situation, JDU has asked for 25 seats for 2019
 vahiin paswan ne 7 siton kii demand rakhi he
 Whereas in the 2014 elections, BJP 22 and LJP 6 and Kushwaha's party won 3 seats
 yahi vajah he ki ab endie main siton ko lekar ghamaasan machaa hua he
 There were a lot of allegations and counter-allegations between RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav and JDU on Friday for the fast growing criminal incidents in Bihar
 2 din pehle munger main ek 6 varshiya bacchee kaa shav mila or uske parijanon ne aarope lagaaya ki unki beti ke saath balaatkaar kii ghatana ghati he
 On the same incident, Tejashwi Yadav attacked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Twitter and said that under his leadership, Bihar has now become a rape secret where the incident of rape of a 6-year-old minor girl took place and Nitish was trying to save his chair
 Are circling
 tejasvi ne kaha ki janadesh kaa balaatkaar karne ke baad nitish kumaar kii praathamikta keval apni kursi bachaane main he
 This attack by Tejashwi Yadav immediately struck back and asked him the question whether he remembered who RJD MLA Rajaballabh Yadav was and in which case he was in jail for the last 2 years? Significantly, Rajaballabh Yadav has been in jail for the last 2 years on charges of raping a minor girl
 party pravaktaa sanjay singh ne tejasvi yadav se sawaal poocha ki aaj jab aisi ghatnaon ke ho jane par vahanitish kumarase istipha maang rahe hai to kya jab vah sarkaar main the or us vakt bhi aisi ghatnaayen hoti thi to vah us vakt apana istipha kyon nahin dete the ? tejasvi par tanj kasate hue sanjay singh ne poocha ki kya rajballabh yadav satyagrah main jail gaye hai ?jadyu pravaktaa ne kaha ki tejasvi jaisaa netaa jo rajballabh yadav ko paal kar rakhti ho uske chele chapatti bhi vaise hi honge
 Attacking Tejashwi, Sanjay Singh said that how can a leader serve the public on the foundation of corruption, murder, massacre, robbery, robbery, kidnapping and scam? The opportunity to serve the public by staying was once found, but they lost that opportunity only to earn money
 haridwar main hoga mahakumbh kaa aayojanamahakumbh ke aayojan ko lekar baithikhada parishad ke santon se maangen sujhavauttarakhand main 2021 ke mahakumbh ke safal aayojan or taiyaariyon ko lekar manthan kiya ja rahaa he

 mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ne kaha ki 2021 main haridwar main bhavy mahakumbh kaa aayojan kiya jayega
 CM Rawat said that on 11 October 2019, a meeting will be held in Haridwar with the Akhada Councils for a successful Kumbh

 shahari vikaas mantri madan kowshik ne kaha ki aagaamee mahakumbh ek badi chunauti he
 a detailed action plan is being chalked out to conduct a safe Kumbh
 sant samaaj ke aashirwad se sakushal kumbh kaa aayojan kiya jayega
 The Chief Minister said that special attention will be given to cleanliness in Kumbh
 vahiin akhaada parishad ke adhyaksh mahant narendra giri mahraaj ne kaha ki mahakubh main suraksha vyavastha main akhaada parishad kii ore se puraa sahyog diya jayega
 He suggested that permanent nature works to be held at Kumbh Mela should be started soon
 mahakumbh main akhaadon ke rahane kaa kalendar bane or uskaa vyapak prachaar-prasar bhi ho
 He suggested that a pre-planned action plan should be made for parking lots, widening of roads, construction of bridges for the fair
 priyanka gandhi ne ek baar phir apane chachere bhai varun gandhi par joardaar hamalaa bolaa he
 He has accused Varun Gandhi of betrayal
 priyanka ne kaha, 'yah ghar kii chaay party nahin he
 Ideology is a battle
 wo hamaari virdohi vichaardhaara ke saath khadey hai to jaahir he ki ham sawaal uthaaenge hi
 Priyanka Gandhi said, 'no matter how close you are
 agar vah vichaardhaara ke us taraf honge, to hamaara virodh rahegaa, yahi meraa yakeen he
 i am saying this again and again that he had put some ideas in the last election, in which i do not believe at all
 ye parivaar ke saath dhokhaa he
 My father died for the unity of this country
 main uskaa apmaan nahin kar sakati
 It is not a matter of brother
 meraa apana betaa bhi aisa karegaa to main virodh karuungi
 Earlier, in Amethi, Priyanka opened a front against Varun Gandhi
 priyanka ne sultanpur kii janata se apil karte hue kaha tha ki bijepi ke tikat par lard rahe varun gandhi ko sahi raste par laane ke liye haraa den
 Talking to activists in Amethi, he had said, 'blood and hate do not run in our veins, love and unity run
 agar galat raste par koi chal rahaa he to raajnneeti main kabhi-kabhi janata kaa vivek sahi rasta dikhaa detaa he
 In the meantime, when the political attack on the son was called, the mother came back again
 menka ne priyanka ko ulte samajhaayaa ki desh bhakthi or deshprem kya hota he, iske liye certificate kii jarurat nahin
 He said, 'to serve the country is to be lost, then the country will tell who has lost the way
 'priyanka gandhi ke hamale kaa jawaab varun gandhi ne bahut hi sanyamit tareeke se diya par ishaaron hi ishaaron main kamjor na aankane kii naseehat bhi de di
 He said, 'do decent politics, consider the honor of others as your honor
 kisi ko kshati na pahunchaaen
 Has never broken the Lakshman Rekha of decency
 chaahe apane parivaar ke log hon, chaahe duusare dal ke varisht netaa kyon na hon
 We should not cross the Lakshman line
 in dinon kuch baaten sunne main ai hai
 Just want to say that our shame and generosity should not be considered as weakness
 'jubaani jang kii vajasamethi-raibareli or sultanpur seat se nehru gandhi parivaar kaa bahut purana naata he
 It is also a coincidence that this time, one candidate each of these three seats is frozen in these three seats
 raibareli seat par congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi lard rahi hai to amethi seat par rahul gandhi jabaki sultanpur seat par bijepi ke mahasachiv varun gandhi
 Last time, Sanjay Singh of Congress won from Sultanpur seat
 lekin tab sanjay singh kaa prachaar karne na sonia gayi, na rahul or na priyanka
 On the other hand, Sanjay Singh never used to go to Rahul Gandhi's form admission
 party ek thi lekin rishton main ek alag kism kii khatas rahi lekin is baar sultanpur main varun ne chunaav ladakar inke rishte ko badal diya
 When Sanjay Singh was called in Rahul's nomination, Priyanka came to Sultanpur to ask for votes for Sanjay Singh's wife, that too against her own brother
 darasal, gandhi parivaar ko amethi main sanjay singh ke madad kii jarurat padegi
 In such a situation, an attempt is being made to assure Sanjay Singh through rhetoric

 Former Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh met party president Sonia Gandhi in Delhi on Friday amid reports of his removal from the post of Deputy Leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha
 sansad main unki gaiyr maujuudagi par puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha, 'meri maa kii tabiyat kharaab thi
 In this connection, i myself spoke to the Congress President and i went to Dubai only at his behest
 ' saath hi, party chhodane kii atakalon par unhone kaha ki vah mukhyamantri rah chuke hai or congress chhodkar kahaan ja sakate hai
 On the demand to remove party state president Pratap Singh Bajwa in Punjab, Captain Amarinder clearly said, 'we need a strong leadership to win
 bajva kii aguwai main ham chunaav nahin jeet sakate
 Amarinder returned from Dubai on Thursday
 gauratlab he ki party alaakaman par dabaav banane ke liye captain amarinder singh ne patiala main apane samarthakon or vidhayakon kii meeting bulaai he
 He also called one such meeting on 19 December last year, in which more than 30 of his close leaders and several mlas attended
 lekin, unki koshishen abhi tak naakaam rahi hai
 According to party sources, both Sonia and Rahul are not in the mood to try the Captain for the third time
 pichley do chunaav unke netritv main lade gaye or donon baar congress ko niraashaa haath lagi
 In 2012, the party introduced him as Chief Minister
 baharhaal, unke rukh ke samarthan main ludhiana ke purv saansad manish tiwari ne kaha, 'koi bhi pherbadal party netritv kaa ekadhikaar he lekin isamen koi shaq nahin ki captain amarinder punjab main hamaare sabase kaddavar netaa hai
 ' vahiin pradesh adhyaksh pratap bajva ne kaha kii ,'captain amarinder singh ko lakshmana rekha nahin paar kerani chahie
 Whatever conversation he had with the Congress president, he should not have been put in front of the media
 unke netritv main ham do chunaav lagaataar haare
 i never questioned him
 main tab tak adhyaksh bana rahoonga, jab tak sonia ji or rahul ji kaa bharosa mujh par rahegaa
 'bajwa said,' i will request Captain Amarinder Singh to help me to overthrow the akali-bjp government instead of targeting me
 ' In the Punjab Congress, which is constantly battling factionalism, the cold war between Captain and Bajwa factions has been hot since November
 darasal tab pradesh adhyaksh pratap singh bajva ne ludhiana (shahari) unit ke adhyaksh pawan dewan ko party virdohi gatividhiyon ke aarope main pad se hataa diya tha
 The Diwan is considered close to Captain Amarinder
 uttari kinartak ke kai netaa siddharmaiya ko rajya ke is hisse kii kisi seat se chunaav ladaane kii maang kar rahe the
 Before Badami, Doctor Devraj Patil was given a ticket
 party rajya kii sabhi 224 vidhansabha siton par ummidavaaron kaa elaan kar chuki he
 Earlier on April 15, Congress released the first list of 218 candidates
 saahsee hona takat va maahaul par nirbhar nahin hota iske liye niyat or manshaa zyada jaruri he
 Why didn't Prime Minister Narendra Modi form the government with the political courage and 'family' and separatist people (sajjad Lone) in Kashmir, the same courage? The will power that came out of the bjp's decision to go beyond the political philosophy of Kashmir in Kashmir, needed a similar resolution for a budget full of revolutionary reforms
 modi sarkaar ke nau maah bitne or behad mahatvapurn bajaton (rail va aam bajet) ke ausat hone ke baad ab yah sawaal uthanaa laazmi he ki sarkaar gavarnence main koi bada parivartan karne kii niyat rakhti bhi he yaa big idia kii pukaar or badlaav ke kaul keval chunavi jabaani jamaa kharch the? upabhoktaaon, kisaanon, rojgaar talashte yuvaaon se lekar companiyaan or videshi reating agenciyaan (fich, standard and pur) bhi is bajet ke asar ko lekar mutmain nahin hai to sirf isliye kyonki yah ek daraa hua bajet tha jo kahin bhi kuch nayaa va bada karne se thithak gaya he or tehraav va thage jane kaa ehsaas chhod gaya he
 Everyone knows what was found in the railway and general budget
 magar yah jaananaa behatar hoga ki aisa kya ho saktaa tha jo inhen 1991 ke baad ke sabase parivartankaree bajaton main badal detaa
 On the basis of the same political courage with which the BJP formed the government in Jharkhand through a change of party, Suresh Prabhu could declare that the railways would now run only the railways
 rail nir kii bottlen bharna, pahie-sleeper bananaa, ingine-dibbe gadhana railway kaa kaam nahin he
 The resources sold by selling the government's share in these factories could be put into the rail network
 yah railway kaa mek in india ho saktaa tha
 Railways needed only such a big idea which would open the way for outright change
 ab agar ek saal baad bhi railway jas kii tas rahe to chaunkiega nahin, kyonki rail network ke liye paanch saal main 8
 5 lakh crore Rs
 kahaan se aaenge, yah khud ‘prabhu’ bhi nahin bataa sakate
 The stubbornness with which the political takeover of the Land Acquisition Act was changed, why cannot the same courage be shown in the decision to open foreign investment in retail business? It is known to everyone within the government that the country's retail market, which reaches around $ 950 billion by 2018, can be the biggest source of employment
 is ‘trade in india’ main kheti samet tamaam kshetron ke liye sambhaavnaaen chhipi hai jo cash transfar ke saath badhane vaale upabhokta kharch ke mafik he
 With regard to foreign investment in retail, BJP only had to convince its indigenous clan, which would have been easier than the thorny path of land acquisition
 sarkaar ko kaarobaar se baahar nikalne or gavarnence karne kii salaah dene vaale pradhanmantri agar air india, bharat sanchaar nigam, beemaa nigam jaisi companiyon ke vinievesh kaa elaan nahin kar paae to yah sirf kamjor ichha shakti kaa namoona he
 Budget figures are a chuckle of expectations from the Modi government
 muftakhori par bahen fatkaarane ke vipareet bajet main gaiyr petro sabsidi kaa bill jas kaa tas he
 The government reverted to the same old social security schemes, whose failure is authentic
 kharch to shiksha va swasthya par kam hua he jo aam janata ke liye modi kii ‘man kii baton’ kaa thik ulataa he
 In order to agree to the new model of transfer of resources to the states, the recommendations of the Finance Commission, however, have become the means of this change which any government would accept
 riyaayaton ke baavjood companiyaan or videshi agenciyaan agar bajet par mutmain nahin ho paa rahi hai to vajah yahi he ki modi-arun jetali aarthik sudhaaron ke agle charan kaa vaada karte hue aae the, na ki ek kaamchalaoo or katarbyont vaale bajet kaa
 modi-jaitley needs to remember that there are suspicions over the piecemeal changes, but big and outright reforms prove courageous to the government
 upie sarkaar ke diarect cash transfar yaa aadhaar skiimon ko swikaarna udaartaa kaa pramaan he lekin inase aage na bad paanaa is baat kaa pramaan bhi he ki nai sarkaar yathasthiti ko behatar karne se zyada kaa saahas nahin juta saki
 This is the reason why the implementation of the social schemes of the budget is as suspicious as it was with the UPA and the figures in the budget are exactly the same as it has always been
 chintaa yah nahin he ki bajet ausat he balki niraashaa is baat kii he ki modi sarkaar jis nai or badi sujh kaa bharosa dekar satta main ai thi vah nau maah main kahin nahin dikhi
 In December last year, we wrote in this column that it is always better to look at governments from the opposite side, because five years is not much time
 modi sarkaar ke paas ab keval do bajet bache hai
 Two precious budgets just passed
 july ke bajet main sarkaar kaa agenda aana chahie tha or is bajet main acshan plan
 The 2016 budget would have tried to balance the impact of the reforms and new steps should have been taken in 2017 as the 2018 budget would be electoral and the 2019 budget would be presented by the new government
 logon ne modi sarkaar se taare todane kii apeksha nahin jodi thi
 The only hope was that the appearance of business and life should change
 ab chaah kar bhi bahut kuch karne kaa vakt nahin he kyonki agle do bajet to bas galtiyaan sudhaarte hi biit jaaenge
 JNU Chhatra Sangh president Kanhaiya Kumar is once again in the grip of controversies
 is baar unka apane bacchon or bivi kaa naam 'bharat mata kii jai' rakhane vaala bayaan vivaad kii vajah bana he
 In a ceremony on Friday, Kanhaiya Kumar said that 'they say the country is everything, you have to say Bharat Mata ki Jai

 is tarah se mere bacchon ko muft shiksha mil jaaegi unhen kisi bhi tarah kii fees nahin deni padegi
 Please tell that Kanhaiya Kumar is currently released on bail
