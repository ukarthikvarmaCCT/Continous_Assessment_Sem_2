 Mamta did not come, and Modi's Bengal Jikramata Banerjee was the first to declare GST not to participate in this session
 unke vitt mantri amit mitra bhale hi jiesti kii council meeting main shaamil hote rahe par unhone lagu karne ke vakt ko kam bataate hue isamen aane se inkaar kar diya
 Modi said in his speech - GST is such a catalyst, there is an imbalance in trade and will eliminate it
 jo rajya viksit hue hai unke saath saath peeche chute rajyon ko bhi aage badhayega
 States like Bihar, Eastern UP, West Bengal, Odisha will go ahead when a law is arranged
 purvi hisse ko vikaas kaa avasar milegaa

 Jawaharlal Nehru's freedom speech
 trist vidadestni spich kii barabari karne kii baat kii gai
 But Modi got ahead of it
 unhonecentral haul kaa itihaas bataate hue sabase pehle samvidhan kii baithak kaa zikr kiya

 Patel
 wo sadan,jo kabhi14agast1947raat12baje desh kii swatantraaa pavitra or mahaan ghatnaka sakshya he
 26 November 1949 The country accepted the constitution
 yah vahi jagah he
 And today there can be no other place than GST, for this work
 dekha jaae to modi ne nehru ke trist vid destni kaa thik se zikr bhi nahinkia

 patel kii tarifmodi ne apni spich main kaha- ham kalpana karen jab desh aaazaad hua tab500riyaasaten thim
 If Sardar Patel had not united all of them, what would have been the map of the country? Just as Patel had done the work of integration, today the important work of economic integration is being done through GST
 yahpahala mauka nahin he jab modi ne patel ko itani ahmiyat di

 The ministers of the Modi government also believe that there will be problems in the business after the implementation of GST
 mahangaai badi toaam logon ko bhi dikkat hogi
 PM Modi also gave clarification about this beforehand

 If the number increases and new glasses come, it takes a few days to adjust it

 India are now trailing 0-2 in the 5-match series
 lords test main bhartiya team jis tarah se pari se haari he usase phens ke haath niraashaa lagi he
 But now many questions are also arising out of this defeat, questions also arise
 kyonki series shuru hone se pehle badi-badi baaten kii ja rahi thim, lekin ab test kii ye number 1 team phiseddi sabit ho rahi he
 Virat Kohli is currently the best batsman in the world as a batsman, but his mistakes as captain at Lord's have overshadowed the Indian team
 jisko lekar kai purv cricketron ne bhi sawaal khadey kiye hai
 1
 hardik ke chayan par sawalbharat pichley kaaphi lambey samay se ek olerounder kii talash main he
 But this quest is not being completed
 abhi team main hardik pandya bataur olerounder khel rahe hai, lekin unke pradarshan ko aadhaar banaae to vah isapar bilkul khare nahin utarate hai
 The great cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has also raised questions about his being in the team
 lords test main hardik pandya ne donon pariyon main milakar sirf 37 ran banaae to vahiin 3 wicket jatke
 At the same time, Hardik was able to score 53 runs in the first Test and he did not take any wickets
 darasal, pichley do maichon main jab bhi ballebaaji mushkil main rahi or kries par hardik kii jarurat rahi wo fail rahe
 2
 ek tej gendbaaj kii khali kameelords test kaa pehla din puri tarah se barish main dhul gaya tha, jisaki vajah se toss main deree hui thi
 But at the time of the pitch report, all the former cricketers had said that it would be good if they also land with a spinner on this pitch
 pich tej gendbaajon ke mutabik thi, iske baavjood umesh yadav jaise gendbaaj ko nahin khilaayaa gaya
 Ishant, Hardik and Shami got wickets at Lord's, apart from that, England's victory also kept them fast bowlers
 3
 Why did not one more batsman get a chance? So far, Indian batting has failed completely in both the Tests
 captain viraat kohli kii 149 ranon kii pari ko choden to abhi tak koi bada asar dekhne ko nahin mila he
 Considering the conditions of the batsmen, it could have been beneficial if Team India went into the Lord's Test with one more batsman in the team
 duusare test main team main badlaav kiya gaya, jisamen spinner ko mauka diya gaya jo shaayad kisi bhi tarah se sahi faisla nahin tha

 He said that due to the order of the Supreme Court, the BJP could not do what it wanted to do
 bijepi congress or jedies ke vidhayakon ko agava karne kii firaaq main thi
 Amit Shah also countered by the Karnataka Governor's move to invite the BJP, the largest party in the state, to form the government
 bijepi ne arunachal main kharid lee puri sarkaar congrescongress netaa sharma ne sawaal kiya ki agar sabase badi party ko hi rajyapal sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit karte hai, to goa or manipur main bijepi ne kya kiya? arunachal main puri sarkaar ko hi bijepi ne kharid liya
 They consider the people of the country as fools
 unhone kaha ki amit shah ko samvidhan kaa gyaan nahin he or agar gyaan he bhi, to wo samvidhan kaa sammaan nahin karte hai
 It is not necessary to have a big party to form a government in a state, but it is necessary to have a two-thirds majority

 He also demanded a probe into the money spent by the BJP in the Karnataka elections
 unhone kaha ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or piem modi kii dohari jubaan or dohari manyata ko hindustan kii janata jaan chuki he
 These people talk about Indian culture, but lie from morning to evening
 amit shah ne kaha ki karnataka main congress ke khilaaf janadesh tha, lekin hakeekat yah tha ki yah gathbandhan ke paksh main janadesh tha

 In Karnataka we have a higher vote percentage than BJP

 2M subs) (@sonotekvideo) on Jan 5, 2018 at 6:37am PST Hello, Ravish Kumar
 baat isaki nahin he ki kisi ne maafee maangi yaa nahin
 The thing is that something is happening around us, about which we are becoming more and more normal
 saamaanya is tarah se ki kahin laudspikar lagane ko lekar to kahin tajia kaa juluus nikaalane ko lekar ham log aapas main lard bhid ja rahe hai or saare maamle ko kanoon vyavastha kaa sawaal banaakar rajya sarkaar banaam kisi raajnneetik dal tak samet kar rakh diya jaataa he
 We have become normalized to such an extent that we are beginning to accept that if there is election time, there will be tension between this community
 khatarnaak kisi saansad kaa vyavhaar yaa bayaan nahin he, khatarnaak he hamaara aisi baton ko lekar saamaanya yani narmal hote janaa
 You must have seen this video on TV all day long
 isamen ek saansad ek karmchaaree ke munh main roti thuns rahe hai
 He is a Shiv Sena MP from Thane, Rajan Vichare and whose face is being puffed up is Arshad Zubair, Resident Manager of IRCTC in Maharashtra Sadan
 arshad kaa kahana he ki aisa karne se uskaa roza samay se pehle tut gaya
 Did you find this behavior of an MP normal? ek saansad ko kya aapane vot dene ke alaava yah bhi adhikaar diya he ki use gussa aa jaae to kisi ke munh main thuns de yaa trephic par utar kar kisi police vaale kii dhunaai kar de
 But if you were not normal, then even in this Parliament, 34 percent do not choose mps who are facing some kind of criminal charges
 hatya jaise gambhir aarope to nahin magar 420 tip ke rajan vichaare par bhi 11 maamle darj hai
 Vichare, a former Thane mayor, found out that President Kalam has also given him the National Energy Award
 shiv sena saansad rajan vichaare ne bayaan diya ki maharashtra sadan main kharaab bhojan pani kii pehle bhi shikaayat kar chuke hai, lekin do maheene se sudhaar nahin hua
 We did not do it intentionally nor were we compelled to eat
 tivi main samvedansheel tasveeron ko loop main yani baar-baar chalaanaa thik nahin hota
 This may provoke resentment in you, so we are showing in this part of the video from the picture whether Rajan did not really force him to eat
 par tasviir thunsane tak kii to gavaahi detii he
 Rajan said that he did not break bread
 magar is tasviir main ek duusare saansad roti khinch kar bataa rahe hai ki kitni sakht ho gai he
 On many channels, this news will be going on anonymously by an English newspaper
 aaj jis akhbaar main yah khabar chhapi uskaa naam he da indian express or reporter hai dipankar ghosh
 In this whole dispute, restraint should never be abandoned and one chance should also be given that the angry MP may not have noticed that Arshad is in front and he has fast
 agar aap yah maan len to bhi aapse yah maanane kii zid nahin kar saktaa ki saansad mahoday ko kisi karmchaaree ke saath aisa karne kaa adhikaar he
 If the MP had only apologized even after understanding the matter of anger, should the MP not regret this anger
 ye to dharm kaa bhi maamla nahin he
 Arshad said, 'I was wearing my uniform
 us par meraa naam bhi likhaa tha
 Everyone also knew my name
 isaki vajah se meraa roza tutaa he
 ' sanjay raut ne kaha ki kisi ke maathe par nahin likhaa hota ki vah kis dharm kaa he
 This was the mode of movement
 ab aapke paas do vikalp hai
 Either accept this method of movement or you can accept their point that religion was not written on anyone's forehead
 vaise vardi par naam likhaa tha to aise sadanon main aane jane vaale netaa vahaan ke karmchaariyon ko naam se nahin to shakal se pahachaanate hi hai
 Arshad is the Resident Manager and the manager's name is known
 arshad jis iarsitisi kaa karmchaaree he un logon ne zarur is maamle kii shikaayat kii
 It is another matter that no action was taken even after seven days of the incident
 indian express ke anusaar ghatana ke chand ghanton ke bheetar iarsitisi ne apane saare kaam roak die
 a written complaint to the Resident Commissioner of Maharashtra that one of his employees, Arshad Zubair, is seriously hurt and unhappy as it involves religious sentiment
 racident kamishnar ne iarsitisi or arshad se maafee bhi maang lee
 In his email on July 17, the deputy manager of IRCTC wrote that today 12–15 mps met in New Maharashtra Sadan
 ve bijli, civil or saaf safai or khaane pine ko lekar shikaayat kar rahe the
 The entire delegation, which also included electronic media, entered the public dining hall of Maharashtra Sadan and started picking up and throwing utensils of pots in the buffet area
 karmchaariyon ko maarane peetane kii dhamkee di or abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya
 Arshad was forced to eat whole chapati while he was on fast
 ek channel par hamane dekha ki saansad bufe aria main dhakkanon ko phenk nahin rahe the balki uthaa uthaakar dekh rahe the
 Now the question is whether Shiv Sena mps expressed any regret to Arshad at the time or after this incident
 jabaki bijepi ke netaa shivasena se zyada maafee maang rahe the
 Shiv Sena did not openly apologize or apologize
 ulta aarope lagane lagi ki use badnaam kiya ja rahaa he
 Meanwhile, there was another incident in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday when Vidhu and Owaisi, a BJP MP, got into a debate and Vidhuri ji said some indecent things
 sansadeey kaarymantri vekainya naidu ne bhi sakhti se kah diya ki party aise bartaav ko manyata nahin detii
 Vidhuri also had to apologize at the behest of the speaker and Vekaiah
 ham to bas itnaa sa sawaal karenge ki aakhir yah kisi raajnneetik samskruti he jahaan ashok singhl se lekar praniv togadiya or ovaisi bandhu tak kuch bhi bol jate hai
 People gather behind their talk and start speaking anything against each other
 ham sab narmal yani saamaanya hone kii tamaam hadon ko paar karte hue yahaan tak aa gaye hai, ab ulta secular hone ko lekar hi gariyaate hue fakhr mahasoos karte hai
 Prime time
 kanoon ayog ne sarkaar se mangalvaar ko ek report saunpkar sifarish kii he ki hindu kanoon main sanshodhan hona chahie, jisase bahu kaa bhi saas-sasur kii sampatti par adhikaar ban paae
 If the husband is unable to give alimony, then give the allowance to the in-laws
 maujuuda praavdhaanon main ek mahila ko uske pati kii shaareerik yaa maansik aakshamata, laapata hone, alag hone yaa anya kaarnon se bhatta na de paane kii sthiti main sasuraal waalon se guzaara bhatta daawa karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 In the report presented before Law Minister Sadanand Gowda, the Commission said, 'the rights of a Hindu woman whose husband is unable to pay alimony should be protected
 ' panel ke mutabik dhara 18 ke section 4 ke tahat, 'jahaan pati shaareerik, maansik, patni ko chhodane, laapata hone yaa kisi bhi kaaran se patni ko guzaara bhatta dene main asamarth he to hindu patni ko sanyukt hindu parivaar se bhatta lene kaa adhikaar milanaa chahie or vah bhatta pati kii sampatti main hisse se alag hoga
 'it was recommended that the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act 1956 be changed now
 agar pati ne parivaar se sampatti main pehle hi hissaa le liya he to us surat main patni ko sirf gujara bhatta milegaa na ki sampatti main hissaa
 The panel said that the wife had no way to get a share in the property other than the countless rounds of the court if the first husband could not pay alimony, the process was too long
 aapako bataa den ki yah mudda punjab or haryana hoicourt ke jariye pichley saal ayog ke paas aayaa tha, jahaan jahaan ek maansik rup se aksham pati ke pita se patni ne sampatti main hissaa maanga tha, jisase vah apana guzaara chalaa sake, pati or bachche kii dekharekh kar sake
 He got his share under an agreement, but the decedents later denied him property

 lekin vahaan maujuud kisi vyakti ne is puure ghatnakram kaa hi video bana liya or soshal media par aplod kar diya
 The administration also came into action after these videos surfaced

 Significantly, the voting is kept completely confidential so that no one else can find out who has voted for which party or candidate, but such a video can lead to breach of privacy

 bharat ke liye do isisi world cap khitaab jeet chuke mahendra singh dhoni ne ipel spot phixing par apni chuppi todi he
 Whether it is inside the field or outside the field, Dhoni has always behaved in moderation
 ipel spot phixing main naam ghasite jane ke baad bhi dhoni ne kuch aisa hi kiya
 In the investigation report of Justice Mukul Mudgal, there were speculations about MS Dhoni's name
 aise main team india ke captain se kai baar spot phixing par sawaal puche gaye, lekin unhone adhiktar maukon par chup rahanaa hi behatar samajha
 Following the Supreme Court's decision on spot-fixing, Mahi has presented her stand
 australia ke khilaaf mahatvapurn mukaable se pehle dhoni ne kaha ki jab bhi bhartiya cricket main kuch hota he, to unka naam ghasita jaataa rahaa he
 The captain also said that now all things are over, but then somewhere his name will be dragged in some case, which he has become used to
 team india kaa captain hona kitna mushkil he, yah dhoni ke bayaan se saaf ho jaataa he
 Dhoni said that if nothing happens, then someone creates a story from his mind and includes his name in it and he has become used to living with such things
 dhoni ko bharat ke liye cricket khelte hue kareeb ek dashak ho chukaa he
 In such a situation, even though he has been cooking, the IPL spot-fixing case will remain a bitter memory for him
 america raashtrapati baraak obama or pradhanmantri narendra modi beete somvaar ko jab dinar par mili to unhone nijee kahaniyaan or anubhav saajha kiye
 With this, the two leaders formed a close personal relationship
 donon netaaon ke bich vah mulaakaat kareeb 90 minuton tak chali or is dauraan unke bich itnaa acha talmail ban gaya ki raashtrapati obama vyast kaaryakran ke baavjood martin luther king junior ke smarak par modi ke saath gaye
 Phil Rainer, senior director of the National Security Council of the White House, said, "you can look at many other things on this visit
 yah daura isaki misaal he ki donon ke bich kitna nijee str kaa samvaad tha
 "he told foreign correspondents," The truth is that the President of America went to the Martin Luther King Memorial with the Prime Minister of India
 yah iskaa sanket he ki vah ek duusare ke saath kitne sahaj the
 "even at dinner, the president recalled old memories when he went to India with his family," Rainer said
 meraa maananaa he ki isko lekar bhi kuch baatcheet hui ki bharat kaa daura kitna mjedaar rahaa tha or vahaan unhone nrity bhi kiya
 It was a very warm moment
 mujhe lagata he ki pradhanmantri ne us samay kaa ullekh kiya jab vah kuch saal pehle washington disi aae the
 Modi and Obama also shared many stories with each other
 unhone kaha, ‘shaayad sabase zyada isko lekar baatcheet hui ki pehali baar sarkaar main aane par unka anubhav kaisaa rahaa
 He acknowledged that a lot could be done with technology in government
 ' No matter how good you are, you have all the qualities but if your first impression is bad then wrong opinion can be formed about you

 Many times on the first date, boys do something that creates a wrong image in front of the girl
 aise main in choti-choti baton ko dhyaan main rakhkar aap is tarah kii kisi bhi sthiti se batch sakate hai:1
 If you are going on a date, don't just talk about yourself
 baton kaa dayera aisa hona chahie ki saamne baitha shaks par kuch baat kar sake
 Instead of reciting Ram Kahani, give the front person full opportunity to speak
 2
 Mobile has become a necessity for all of us, but if you have gone on a date with someone, then checking mobile repeatedly or talking on mobile repeatedly can spoil your impression
 3
 Only talk politely on a date
 majaak karnaa bhi acha he lekin pehali hi date par sex kii baaten karnaa yaa ghatiya joke sunaanaa aapke impressant ko barbaad kar saktaa he
 4
 date par jakarapaka dhyaan saamne baithe shaks par hi hona chahie
 Staring at another girl in front of someone may question your personality
 5
 It is not a bad thing to tell someone's mistakes, but every work should be done according to time and place
 ye wo jagah nahin he jahaan aap saamne baithe shaks ko uski galtiyaan bataaen
 6
 apane puraane rishton ke bare main baaten karnaa or uski tarif karnaa
 Don't forget to do anything like this or else your Christian will be under suspicion before it starts

 co / cy2uuutirk — Asaduddin Owaisi (@asadowaisi) May 24, 2019 In Madhya Pradesh's Seoni, goons came to know about two young men and a woman in an auto carrying beef with them
 iske baad lathi-danda lekar gunde-badmaashon kaa puraa laav lashkar in logon par tut padaa
 All the limits of ruthlessness with the youth were crossed
 pehle yuvak ko ped se lagaakar do yuvakon ne uske haath pakade or phir us par lathi-danda barasaane lage
 There were sharp blows from one pole to another
 yuvak chillaata rahaa, gidgidaata rahaa, raham kii bheekh maangata rahaa, lekin in jallaadon kaa dil kahaan pasijane vaala tha, ye jaanwaron kii tarah use peetate rahe, peetate rahe or bas peetate rahe
 When the body of these executioners got filled up after being beaten to a tree, it was then beaten and then beaten again
 haathon se lathi-danda baras rahe the or munh se gaaliyon kii bauchhaar ho rahi thi
 He whipped as he wished
 jiske haathon main danda nahin the, usne laaten barasaai
 When one was beaten and beaten, the number came to another
 uske saath bhi vaisaa hi saluk kiya gaya
 Gradually, the number of these goons increased and the pitchers continued to beat them
 duusare shaks ko bhi jamkar peeta gaya
 Not only this, these goons did not spare the woman and got slippers on her at the hands of her companions
 in logon ne jabaran jai shriram ke naare bhi lagavaaye
 This video of beating in the name of cow protection is two or three days old, but after it went viral, the police came into action and arrested an accused while taking action in the case
 north korea or america ke bich ab zubaani jang is str par aa gai he ki donon deshon ke rashtradhyakshon ne bacchon kii tarah ladanaa shuru kar diya he
 Threatening the US on the new year, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un said that his nuclear weapons can now reach any city in the US and his button stays on his table
 to iske jawaab main america raashtrapati donald trump ne kim ko dhamkaate hue kaha ki ye batan unke paas bhi he or ye, uske batan se na sirf bada he balki zyaada taqatvar bhi he
 The war of Trump and Kim started again! North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un declared, "the whole of America is under our nuclear weapons and the nuclear button is always on my desk
" ' america ke raashtrapati donald trump ne kaha 'mere paas tumse bada or taqatvar newclear batan he, or kaam bhi karata he
 In response to Kim Jong Un's nuclear button, a larger 'button' of Donald Trump has surfaced
 america raashtrapati ne kim ko bhadakaane vaala bayaan diya he
 Trump said, 'I have a bigger and stronger nuclear button than you
 'tisare vishwayuddh ke liye jimmevaar honge kim or trump!parmaanu bamon se las do deshon ke rashtradhyaksh agar is tarah jhagadne lage to aap khud andaaza lagaaiye ki anjaam-e-gulistaan kya hoga
 That is to say, what can be expected from such statements about the end of nuclear war and peace
 agar nahin, to kya duniya vishwayuddh kaa intazaar kare
 But if the world becomes clouded by crisis, then it will be these two people responsible for it
 inamen se ek wo he jise duniya taanashaah kahati he or uski zindagi kaa ek hi maqasad itane parmaanu hathiyaar bananaa ki america kaa zarraa zarraa tabah or barbaad kar sake
 And on the other side is the one who is called the most powerful President of the world and his life is also intended to ruin Kim Jong
 magar donon jis tarah ek duusare par apane bayanon se hamalon kii bauchhaar kar rahe hai usase lagata he ki ye in donon kii nijee jang he
 But believe it, if there is a war, it will not only be in these two, but all the world will come in its JD

 In response to this same statement by Kim, President Trump has retweeted a tweet
 trump kaa javalmerica ke raashtrapati donald trump ne kaha 'uttar korea ke netaa kim jong un ne abhi kaha he ki parmaanu bam kaa batan hameshaa unki desk par rahata he
 Will anyone from his overrun and starved state tell him that i also have the button for the atomic bomb
 or ye uske bam se kahin bada or taqatvar he, meraa batan kaam bhi karata he
 'trump fueled the atmosphere
 How dangerous is the small and big button that the two countries are threatening with nuclear bombs
 haalanki apane bayaan main north korea ke taanashaah ne ye zarur kaha tha ki wo shanti chahta he or tab tak newclear shakti kaa istemaal nahin karegaa jab tak america ke khilaaf jab tak koi yuddh nahin hota
 But instead of trying for peace, the US President has made the matter more hot with this new statement
 vishvashanti ke liye khatrajankaar maan rahe hai ki donon deshon ke rashtradhyakshon kaa ye ravaiyya na sirf vishvashanti ke liye khatra he balki ghaatak bhi sabit ho saktaa he
 Let me tell you that in these statements of Trump and Kim, this heat came after the test of North Korea's Hwasong-15 missile which has a strike power of 13 thousand km
 yani ye missile america ke kisi bhi shahar tak maar kar sakati he
 Since its successful testing, Kim's nuclear program has gained momentum, while America's concerns have increased

 The creator / Republic Day of modern India, Vishal Lal Bahadur Shastri, was a tangible form of handing over power to Indians in addition to the freedom movement
 ve aisi chaabi the jo kisi bhi taale main lag sakati thi
 When Jawaharlal Nehru got a visit, i told Shastri that he should be ready to take over the reins, but he was sure that Indira would be ahead in the queue
 jab vakt aayaa, tamaam siyasatdan shastri ke irdagird jamaa ho gaye, kyonki ve kisi ko naaraaz nahin karte the
 At the Tashkent Agreement of 1966, Shastri met with the President of Pakistan, Ayub Khan and insisted that the final agreement should be included that the dispute between Hindustan and Pakistan in future would be resolved peacefully without using weapons
 lekin antim dastavej main yah likhaa nahin tha
 Shastri then asked Job Khan why he had not kept his main condition clearly
 Then Job had to write it with his own hand
 1966 main rahasyamayi halaat main unki maut se pehle moscow main shastri is baat se pareshaan the ki samjhaute par dastakhat to ho chuke hai, par media ke log or siyasatdan is baat se naakhush the ki do ahm chowkiyaan pakistan ko kyon saunp di gayi? zyaadaatar logon ko laga ki ve rus ke dabaav ke aage jhuk gaye hai

 (praachi bhuchar se baatcheet ke aadhaar par)(shastri jab grih mantri the, tab lekhak unke press sachiv the) Asked about the Gandhian Anna Hazare movement, director Prakash Jha said, 'I support his ideology
 main bhrashtachar hataane kaa samarthak hum
 Be it the Lokpal Bill or the bill related to making the judiciary accountable
 hamen uskaa samarthan to karnaa hi hoga
 On the question of the possibility of making a film on Hazare in the future, he said, 'hazare is very big and can have many aspects
 ab dekhiye aage kaisaa vichaar banataa he
 'know what is Jan Lokpal? After recovering from the ban on his latest controversial film' Reservation ', producer-director Prakash Jha says that his motive is finally fulfilled and he does not want to blame anyone for the controversy
 jha ne ucchtam nyaayalay ke nirdesh se rasta saaf hone par film ke uttar pradesh main relies hone ke baad aaj yahaan samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha ki aarakshan jaise jwalanth or samvedansheel mudde par aadhaarit film ke uttar pradesh, punjab or andhra pradesh main pradarshan par shuruaati roak kaa bura prabhaav jarur padaa lekin aakhirkaar vah apane makasad main kaamyaab rahe
 Special coverage on Anna's movement, he said, 'my purpose is served
 main kisi ko dosha nahin dena chahta
 Those who banned it must have their own thinking
 ashankaon ke aadhaar par hi unhone vah karrwai kii hogi
 However she ultimately proved to be wrong
 ’saamaajik muddon par filmein banane ke liye mashhoor is filmkaar ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main film kaa pradarshan rokna durbhagyapurna tha or yah faisla pratikriya main liya gaya, lekin vah iske liye kisi ko dosha nahin dena chaahate

 haalanki gat shuukravaar ko ucchtam nyaayalay ke nirdesh ke baad rajya main film relies hone kaa rasta saaf ho gaya tha
 Jha termed the Supreme Court verdict as historic and far-reaching on his appeal against the suspension of the reservation protest
 jha ne kaha, ‘yah film udyog ke liye bahut bada faisla he
 With this decision, it has been decided that after getting the green signal from the censor board, any government can suspend the performance of the film for some time but cannot ban it
 yah mere jaise filmkaaron kii swaittata ke liye acchhee baat he
 'know who are Anna Hazare', he said on a question, 'I make films on issues

 adaalat ne kaha ki ienex media ghotaalaa ‘dhanshodhan kaa behtareen udhaaharan' he

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the creator of modern India, laid such a foundation upon which the future of India was built in many important areas after independence
 aazaadee ke baad apane vichaaron or nitiyon kii vajah se vah bharat ke yugadrashtaa ban gayi
 Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad at the home of Motilal Nehru, a Brahmin of Kashmiri origin and Swaroop Rani
 bharat or britain main shiksha praapt karne vaale nehru ne bharat ke aaazaad hone ke baad shiksha, saamaajik sudhaar, aarthik kshetra, rashtriya suraksha or videsh nitiyon or audyogikaran sahit kai kshetron main ek nayi kranti kaa sutarapaat kiya jo aaj bhi praasangik bani hui he
 Qamar Aga, a foreign affairs expert, said that even today, the foundation of our foreign policy is given by Nehru
 samay ke saath videsh niti main badlaav to hota rahata he lekin buniyadi avadharana main aaj bhi kuch khaas badlaav nahin hua he
 'even before India became independent, the Congress Party formed a foreign affairs unit in 1925 headed by Pandit Nehru
 usee samay unhone aupniveshik deshon ke bich samanvay sthapit karne kaa prayaas shuru kar diya jisamen vah kaaphi had tak safal bhi rahe
 Aga said, "before independence, Nehru traveled to Europe and many countries
 unhone kai aupniveshik deshon ke netaaon se sampark sthapit kiya
 Even an international conference of colonial countries was held
 yahi vajah he ki aazaadee ke baad hamen kai saare rashtron se sambandh sthapit karne main kisi badi pareshaani kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa
 Sensing the then conditions of independence, Nehru promoted non-alignment
 do dhruviya shaktishaalee guton ke bich santulan banane kii usee niti par bharat aaj bhi khadaa he haalanki aaj duniya main ekmaatr mahashakti bachi hui he
 Explaining non-alignment, Aga says that this does not mean that India will be related to a particular country or not to a particular country
 gutnirpekshata kaa matlab yah he ki bharat kisi bhi gut kii nitiyon kaa samarthan nahin karegaa or apni swatantra videsh niti barkaraar rakhega
 Former Congress leader Arun Nehru, close to the Nehru Gandhi family, called Jawaharlal Nehru's prime minister's era a 'golden age'
 unhone kaha ki ve ek aise yugadrashtaa the jinhone aane vaale samay kii padchaap ko suna or shaayad yahi vajah he ki unhone na keval iaiti, im or vishvavidhyalayon kii sthapana kii balki desh main udyog dhandhon kii bhi shuruuaat kii
 Nehru considered these industries to be the modern temples of the country and they were quite popular among children
 bacchon main ‘chachaa nehru’ ke naam se mashhoor pandit nehru kaa janmdin bal diwas ke rup main bhi manaaya jaataa he
 Recalling the moments spent with Nehru, Arun Nehru said that even today, memories of Panditji remain in his mind
 ‘meri daadi uma nehru saansad hua karti thi or ham log saptaah main yaa das-pandraa dinon ke antaraal par unke teen murti nivas par khaanaa khaane ke liye jaaya karte the
 He loved eating porridge
 is dauraan vah naukaron ko vahaan nahin rakhte the or ham log khud apane haathon se paros kar khaanaa khate the
 "he told" Pandit Nehru was a simple and simplistic person and he used to visit us when he got time

 purv kaig ne daawa kiya ki congress netaaon ne kaig kii audit rapaton main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri singh ke naam ko baahar rakhane ke liye dabaav banaaya tha
 Rai also criticized coalition politics under the leadership of Manmohan Singh and said that Singh was more interested in staying in power

 Rai told a magazine, 'honesty is not only seen in financial matters, it is also intellectual and there is also professional honesty
 aapane samvidhan ke prati nishtha kii shapath lee he, yah mahatvapurn he
 ' raay se jab poocha gaya ki purv pradhanmantri kii soch ke bare main unki dharna kya he, kyonki kai log unhen bujurg rajaneta ke taur par sammaan dete hai
 In response, Rai said, 'you cannot put the nation under government and the government under the coalition of political parties
 us samay kaha ja rahaa tha ki acchhee raajnneeti, arthvyavastha ke liye bhi acchhee hoti he par kya acchhee raajnneeti kaa matlab satta main bane rahanaa hota he?' Rai is writing a book on his tenure as the Comptroller and Auditor General of the country

 i did not get any reply from the letter i wrote to him
 ' Rai said, 'on one occasion when i met him, the Prime Minister said that i hope you will not expect any kind of reply from me, while he was giving a reply to Raja twice a day
 phir kis tarah unhen us faisle ke liye jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa?' Rai recalled the conversation of 16 November 2010, saying that Singh told him that 1
 76 lakh karod rupee kaa 2-ji spectrum aavanton ke nuksaan kaa aankada gananaa kaa sahi tarika nahin he
 He told the then Prime Minister, 'mr
 This is the way you have taught us, this conversation took place on the stage of Vigyan Bhavan that day
 ' On the audit of Reliance Industries 'KG Basin gas field, Rai said,' The Prime Minister's comment about Reliance in a conversation is not a direct attack on him
 
 In the case of Reliance, no decision was taken at the ministerial level
 ' He said that apart from one or two statements of the then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee at that time, he did not get any support at the political or government level
 kya unka phone tap kiya ja rahaa tha yah puche jane par raay ne kaha, '100 pratishat
 Actually it was being tapped

 Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel has apologized for wearing a Muslim hat to fake terrorists during the anti-terror mock drill
 yah daawa ek angreji channel ne kiya he
 (ruckus over showing 'terrorist' as a Muslim) There was a lot of controversy about the insensitive actions of Surat Police
 is kaaran se anandi ben patel ko kadi aalochana kaa saamana karnaa padaa, jiske baad unhone maafee maangani padi
 Significantly, Surat Police had done this mock drill in Dabhari near Olapad
 jisamen special oparation group ko aatankiyon ko rokane kaa abhyaas karaayaa gaya tha
 During this time, those who were made fake terrorists, were wearing Muslim hats
 gujarat bijepi alpsankhyak cell ke adhyaksh mehboob ali chishti ne is par sakht aitraaj jataate hue kaha ki mock drill main jo topi pahanaai gai, use to namaaj ke vakt pahana jaataa he
 Even terrorists do not wear the same cap at the time of attack
 unhone kaha ki aatankwaad ko kisi dharm vishesh se jodakar dekhnaa thik nahin he
 It was decided to close a station in kami-shirataki village in Hokkaido, Japan, due to non-receipt of passengers
 lekin is faisle ko hiskool main padhane vaali ek ladki ke chalate sarkaar ne kuch samay ke liye taal diya gaya he
 The reason behind this is also very special and thoughtful, because we live in a country where school chalo-like campaigns are conducted, but in fact, this small station in Japan has come out as an example
 jahaan train do vakt sirf isliye jaati-aati he, jisase hiskool main padhane vaali ladki apni padhai bina kisi rukaawat ke kar sake
 It happened that the small station near kami-shirataki village could not get a ride, so the government decided to close it
 magar, jab pataa chalaa ki hiskool main padhane vaali ladki rojaanaa isi train se safar karti he or uske paas skool jane kaa koi or doosraa vikalp nahin he, to sarkaar ne train ko chaalu rakhane kaa faisla kiya
 Apart from this girl, no one climbs or descends in the train
 yahaan tak ki train ke aane-jane kaa samay bhi ladki ke skool ke samay ke hisaab se rakhaa gaya he
 It is being told that when she passes high school, the train will be stopped forever
 yani march ke baad train ko hameshaa ke liye band kar diya jayega

 aam aadmi party raashtrapati se maang karegi ki dilli ke uparajyapal najeeb jang ko sarkaar banane ke liye bijepi ko nyotaa dene se roka jaae
 Meanwhile, Kejriwal, leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, has accused the BJP of horse-trading
 unhone kaha ki maine apane vidhayakon se kaha he ki agar aapako koi kharidne aae, to manaa mat karnaa or unase baatcheet kii recording kar lenaa
 BJP leader Ramveer Singh Bidhuri has claimed that Kejriwal will know what his mlas want if secret voting is done
 darasal kal hi yah baat saamne ai thi ki dilli main sarkaar banane ke liye bijepi ko nyotaa bhejne kii taiyaari kii ja rahi he or iske liye najeeb jang ne raashtrapati se ijaajat maangi he ki kya vah sabase badi party ko nyotaa bhej sakate hai

 'antara' injection teen maheenon ke liye kargar he tathaa ‘chaaya’ goli ek saptaah ke liye prabhavi he
 This will help in meeting the changing needs of the couple, which will help the women in their conception plan
 sabhi rajyon ke swasthya karmiyon kaa prashikshan puraa ho chukaa he, jisamen rajyon tathaa jila str ke doctor or staff nurson ko prashikshan diya gaya

 Former captain Sunil Gavaskar is not at all happy with the bowling of Akshar Patel, who joined Team India
 unhone kade shabdon kaa istemaal karte hue kaha ki baayen haath kaa ye spinner test cricket ke darje kaa spinner nahin he or vah mahaj ek saadhaaran gendbaaj he
 He said that the letter's bowling can be easily estimated
 gavaskar ne kaha ki 21 varshiya spinner bhartiya cricket kaa aglaa bada naam banane kii sthiti main nahin tha or use test cricket main visheshgy spinner nahin mana ja saktaa kyonki vah gend ko turn nahin kara paata
 'akshar balls do not fly' Gavaskar was asked if there was a possibility of a Test spinner in the tournament, he said, 'no, Akshar Patel is not an alternative spinner that India should look into
 vah saadhaaran gendbaaj he jo sirf gend karata he
 His balls do not fly and his balls can be easily guessed
 jab tak pich anukool nahin ho tab tak vah gend ko turn nahin kara paata he
 He bowls a little slower than a medium pace bowler
 ''aswin, bhajji, amit or karn achche opshan'unhone srilanka daure ke liye team india kaa vishleshan karte hue kaha, 'haa, aswin, harbhajan, amit mishra or karn sharma jaise spinneron par bharat gaur kar saktaa he lekin nishchit rup se akshar patel par nahin
 Patel has played 18 odis and two T20 Internationals since his debut in international cricket last year, 26 in 18 odis
 60 kii ausat se 23 wicket liye hai
 He took two wickets in two odis against Bangladesh last month
 zimbabwe ke khilaaf haal main khatm hui paanch vanade kii siries main patel ne teen maichon main paanch wicket hasil kiye the
 'ranji Trophy pitches are also guilty' Gavaskar said that if India has not been able to produce good bowlers in the last few years, the reason for the pitches being prepared for Ranji Trophy can also be blamed to some extent
 unhone kaha, 'pichley kuch varshon se ham achche spinner paidaa nahin kar paae
 One reason for this is the pitches being prepared for Ranji Trophy matches
 ham ranjai maichon ke liye pichon par bahut adhik ghaas chhod dete hai or isse spinneron ko madad nahin milti
 Gavaskar said, "we should prepare pitches that suit both batsmen and bowlers
" ghaas rakhi ja sakati he lekin bahut adhik nahin
 The pitches should be such that the spinners use their flight early in the match and after that they reduce the flight on the second and third day
 ''viraat kaa bharat-e ke liye khilne kaa faisla acha'unhone test captain viraat kohli kaa srilanka siries se pehle chennai main bharat-e match main khilne ke faisle ko sahi bataaya
 Gavaskar said, 'it is a very good decision from Virat
 unhone pichley do teen saptaah main bahut adhik cricket nahin kheli he
 In Bangladesh too, his form has not kept up to his standard
 agar vah bharat-e match main bada score banaata he to aatmavishvaas ke saath srilanka jayega
 'amit's selection in the team is worrying: Agarkar: Former fast bowler Ajit Agarkar expressed surprise over Amit Mishra's selection in the team against Sri Lanka and said it reflected the lack of young spin bowlers in the country
 32 varshiya legbrake gendbaaj mishra ko bhartiya team main karn sharma kii jagah shaamil kiya gaya he
 Agarkar said, 'yes, i am amazed at the inclusion of Amit Mishra in the team
 harbhajan sihan kii hi tarah ve purv spin gendbaajon ko chun rahe hai
 One worrying aspect of this is that we do not currently have any young spin bowlers
 ' agarkar ne kaha, 'mishra lambey samay se neshnal team se baahar chal rahe hai or gharelu cricket main hi sakriy hai
 The reason for this is that their ball falls in the air and at a slow pace on the pitch
 karn chotil he, jiske chalate unhen anbhavi gendbaaj ko chunanaa padaa

 Saurashtra batsman Pujara, who has played 27 Tests so far, played the last Test for India against Australia in December

 He was with the Indian team for two weeks on our England tour last year
 jab vah khelte the to maine unhen training karte hue dekha he or ensie main unase baat bhi kii he
 He further added, "of course his knowledge of the game is superb and everybody becomes quite comfortable with the way he explains
 england or austrailia ke dauron ke bare main pujaara ne kaha ki in do deshon main khilne se unhone vifaltaa ko sweekaar karnaa siikhaa
 He learned a lot by playing in England, he said, 'you need to accept your failure
 england daure se pehle main jitne ran bana rahaa tha uske kaaran maine hameshaa sochaa ki main kisi bhi match main shatak bana saktaa hum, isliye ran nahin bana paanaa mere liye hataasha bharaa anubhav rahaa
 Over time i learned to accept it
 pujaara ne apane khel main nayaa aayam laane kaa shrey england main khilne ke anubhav ko diya
 He said, 'I enjoyed playing in England a lot
 jab aap england main khelte ho to chijen mushkil hoti hai, visheshkar satr kii shuruuaat yani ki april or may ke maheene main
 The weather is cold and the ball moves a lot on fresh wickets, as a batsman it is a challenge and the pressure is doubled because you lose the wicket on a small mistake

 mulayam-shivpal is said to be on the edge that the road to power at the center goes through UP
 2014 main bhi bijepi ne jab purna bahumat kii sarkaar centre main banaai to upi ne 71 saansad party ko die
 In such a situation, it was not easy to challenge Modi and Amit Shah Brigade

 lekin puure chunaav main mulaayam-shivpal ghar main baithe rahe
 Exclusive Election Result TV: Trouble formed with Live Congress alliance with Anjana Om Kashyap, Akhilesh Yadav took over the Samajwadi Party after a family fight

 The Congress was given 105 seats under the alliance
 aise main samaajawaadee party ke ummidavaaron or kaaryakartaaon main is faisle se gussa panpa
 The result was that there were reports of frescoes in the Samajwadi Party

 isi ranneeti ke chalate mayawati ne 97 muslim ummidavaaron ko tikat diya
 However, Mayawati's social engineering did not come to her own work either
 lekin is daanv ne akhilesh ko jarur kinare laga diya he
 Akhilesh was not confident of mulayam-shivpal Samajwadi Party had to face defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 party mahaj paanch siton par simat gai
 After the results, Mulayam Singh's confidence waned from Akhilesh
 darasal mulaayam singh ne kai baar saarvajanik manchon par kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav main akhilesh ke kehane par tikat baante gaye or party ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 This was the reason there was a long tussle between the families before the election
 darasal mulaayam singh or shivpal nahin chaahate the ki tikat baantne kaa adhikaar akhilesh ko mili
 The tussle that started with the right to distribute tickets finally ended by making Akhilesh the national president of the party
 amit shah ke modi sarkaar main mantri banane ke baad ab raajnneetik galiyaaron main ye sawaal gunj rahaa he ki unki jagah ab party kaa rashtriya adhyaksh kise banaaya jayega

 Explain that the BJP had passed a resolution in the party's national executive in September 2018 that the process of election and appointment of the organization and new president can be done only after the Lok Sabha elections are over
 2019 ke ant main hone vaale maharashtra, jharkhand or haryana vidhansabha chunaavon ke maddenzar jab tak desh bhar ke pachaas pratishat se zyaada rajyon main sanghathan ke chunaav nahin ho jate, tab tak party kii ore se kaaryakari adhyaksh ke naam kii hi ghoshnaa kii ja sakati he
 According to sources, the acting president will also be the new president of the party
 iske myne yahi hai ki kaaryakari adhyaksh kii niyukti ke zariye party sanghathan main ye sandesh jayega ki shah ke baad party ke adhyaksh kii kaman koun sanbhaalega?mana ja rahaa hai ki party ke kaaryakari adhyaksh ke liye jepi nadda, bhoopendra yadav or kailash vijayawargeey main se kisi ek ke naam par muhar lag sakati he
 If sources are to be believed, Nadda's name is at the forefront of the race
 nadda ke prabharee rahete bijepi ne upi main badi jeet hasil kii
 Since Nadda's name has not been included in the cabinet, there have been speculations about him becoming the party president
 nadda filhal party kii sabase powerful sansadeey board or kendriya chunaav samiti ke sachiv hai
 Nadda has served as party general secretary from 2010 to November 2014 along with Nitin Gadkari, Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah
 nadda 1991 main party ke varisht netaa murali manhor joshi ke party adhyaksh rahete hue bijepi yuva morcha ke adhyaksh bhi rah chuke hai
 On the other hand BJP General Secretary Bhupendra Yadav is considered close to Amit Shah
 is chunaav main bihar or gujarat ke prabharee ke naate unka pradarshan shandaar rahaa
 At the same time, Kailash Vijayvargiya has done great success for BJP in the stronghold of Didi (mamata Banerjee) in West Bengal on the strength of his organizational capacity, as well as his name should not be ignored in view of the assembly elections in 2021 in West Bengal

 To counter the domination of BJP and Modi, the grand alliance nowadays is very much discussed in the political corridors
 maaya or akhilesh jaise dhur-virdohi bhi takaraahat chhodane ke ishaare karne lage hai
 But, who will be the leader of the coalition
 bengal main tiemasi or left, tamilnadu main dramuk or annadramuk kaise saath aaenge
 These are the questions that Congress will have to find answers to, which is the largest party of the opposition and it wants to be the axis of this grand alliance
 sutron ke mutabik, is mudde par congress ke bheetar rahul gandhi apane nazdikiyon se anaupchaarik charchaa bhi shuru kar chuke hai
 However, the priority of the Congress is to strengthen itself first, so that in the event of an alliance, it is not forced to lose its land to the regional parties
 isliye congress jaldbaaji nahin karnaa chaahati, wo chaahati he ki, jaise maaya or akhilesh ke sur khud ke kamjor hone par naram pade hai, vaise hi baaki kshetreey dal bhi mahagathjod ke liye majaboor hon
 According to sources, there are three plans in front of Congress in Surat of Mahagathjod
 plan e-sabase badi party hone kii surat main piem candidet uskaa ho
 Whether those candidates are Rahul Gandhi himself or Rahul, nominate someone at that time
 darasal, party main ek khemaa maanata he ki, ho saktaa he kai kshetreey kshatrap rahul ke naam par taiyaar naa hon or duusari baat ye bhi he ki, agar kahin sarkaar banati he to kya rahul khud aisi mili-juli sarkaar ke piem bananaa bhi chahenge?plan bi-congress mahagathbandhan main chunaav to lade, lekin chunaav ke baad sarkaar banane kii surat main wo baahar se samarthan de
 In such a situation, a leader like Nitish should be given the chair of PM, so that the performance of the Khichdi government does not affect him
 plan si-rahul congress adhyaksh ke saath hi mahagathbandhan ke mukhiya ban jaaen
 If there is no consensus among regional parties on Rahul's name, then Sonia should be made the head of the grand alliance and a face like Nitish should be presented to Modi as a PM candidate
 haalanki, rahul ke kareebi netaaon kaa kahana he ki, ye sab shuruaati siyaasi charchaaen hai
 2019 is far away
 haa, uske pehle mahagathbandhan kii koshishen hongi, lekin netaa jaise bade sawaal to aakhir main hi tay honge
 Actually, even though there are signs of melting of snow between Maya and Akhilesh in UP
 lekin, bengal main left or mamata ko ek saath mahagathbandhan main laana congress ke liye philhal to dur kii kaudi he
 Similar is the case with the DMK and the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu
 saath hi odisha main naveen patnayak kii bijd ke saamne saalon se mukhya vipakshi kii bhoomika nibhaa rahi congress ab bijepi ke rajya main badhate prabhaav se mushkil main he
 By the way, sources also believe that along with the CBI, there are many government agencies, whose action can play an important role in the formation and deterioration of the Grand Alliance
 aise main mahagathbandhan kii charchaa to tej he, safalataa ke lihaaj se bihar kaa udhaaharan bhi diya ja rahaa he, to upi main basapa kaa mahagathbandhan main naa hona bijepi kii jeet kii vajah bataaya ja rahaa he
 But, until this great alliance reaches the ground, speculation and discussion will continue
 kyonki, mahagathbandhan kii siyaasi raah kaaphi dushwaar or patharilii he
