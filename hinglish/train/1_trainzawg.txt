 Amar Singh, who came to Varanasi with the acting president of Lok Manch Obaidullah Azmi and Rampur MP Jayaprada, climbed on the platform with the help of colleagues and stood up with his support instead of the wheel chair, but his address was more than an hour and his voice There was also enthusiasm and vigor in me
 amar singh ne kaha ki purvanchal main uttar pradesh kii lagbhag aadhi aabaadi (lagbhag nau karod) rahati he or uskaa pratinidhitiv 147 vidhayak or 28 saansad karte hai

 On the new maneuver being carried out by the Chief Minister regarding the bifurcation of the state, Amar Singh said that there is no point in bringing a proposal in the cabinet only for the formation of Purvanchal state
 mayawati sachmuch purvanchal rajya kii himachati hai to aagaamee sheetakaaleen satr ke dauraan vidhansabha main purna bahumat vaali sarkaar se prastaav pesh karaayen or use centre ke paas bhejein

 The feud within the Aam Aadmi Party has come at a new juncture
 2 november ko rashtriya parishad kii baithak ke liye taiyaar kiye gaye agenda se kumaar vishwaas ko gaayab kar diya gaya he
 According to the agenda present with 'aaj Tak', many important issues are to be discussed in the meeting which runs from 9 am to 5 pm, but Kumar has been completely sideline in the agenda sent by the party
 amanatulla khan kaa nilamban radd hone par naaraazgi jaahir kar chukekumar vishwasako party kii ore se ek bada jhatka laga he
 In the National Council of Party Workers' meeting, Kumar's name is not even included in the list of speakers

 Finally, at 4:30 pm, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will address his workers
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki kaaphi pehle taiyaar kar liye gaye agenda menkumar vishwaska naam kahin bhi najar nahin aa rahaa he
 Interestingly, Gopal Rai will discuss the organization of Delhi, but there is no place in the agenda for the trust that is taking charge of Rajasthan
 khud kumaar bhi is baat kaa daawa kar chuke hai ki abtak kii tamaam rashtriya parishad kii baithkon main kaarykram kaa sanchaalan vahi karte the
 In such a situation, the question arises whether the Aam Aadmi Party is once again on the verge of breakdown? 'aaj Tak' has also contacted the leaders and spokespersons of the Aam Aadmi Party, but all have refused to react
 
 aapako bataa den ki rashtriya parishad main lagbhag 300 sadsy hai, jabaki manonith sadasyon kii sankhya 150 ke aasapaas he
 Also, nominated members do not have the right to vote in any case during the meeting

 At the same time, the question also arises whether the mlas who stood in support of Kumar 6 months ago will still stand by their decision

 co / axdqhd5vhs Iran's parliament has passed a bill slapping the face of humanity, women's rights and children's rights, according to which any man can marry his adopted daughter
 iske liye bas ek hi kanoonee pech he ki is god lee hui beti kii umr 13 saal se kam nahin honi chahie
 Iran's parliament claims that the children's rights will be protected after this revolutionary decision
 sansad ke is faisle ke baad maanavadhikaar kaaryakartaaon ne ashanka jataai he ki bacchon kaa utpeedan or badhegaa kyonki parivaar ke mukhiya purush ko court main bas yah sabit karnaa hoga ki apni god lee hui beti se vah uski hi bhalaai ke liye shaadi kar rahaa he
 The 13-year-old girl is not in a position to decide what path she wants to take in life, because of the exploitation of Iranian girls under abusive laws
 bade hokar kya bananaa chaahati he
 By this time, the development of his body is not started properly
 magar iran main yah vah umr he, jab uski kanoonee dhang se shaadi kii ja sakati he
 In the case of boys, this age is 15 years
 itnaa hi nahin iran main 13 saal se kam umr kii bacchee kii bhi shaadi kii ja sakati he
 For this, his parents simply have to file a petition in front of a judge and give permission, giving reasons
 iran kii ek news website kii maane to saal 2010 main hi 10 se 14 saal kii umr ke 42 hajaar bacchon kii shaadi kii gai
 Iran's logic, the decision to liberate from the hijab, this bill passed in the name of protecting the rights of children, is yet to be passed by the Guardian Council of Iran
 iske baad yah kanoon ban jayega
 In this council, Muslim religious leaders consider the religious aspect of the law
 is bill kaa virodh karte hue landan sthit group justise for iran kii kaaryakarta saadi sadr ne kaha ki yah sidhe taur par bacchon ke yon shoshan or rape kaa maamla he
 Speaking to England newspaper The Guardian, Saadi said that none of the laws so far allowed a man to marry his adopted daughter
 nae bill main isaki gunjaaish di gai he
 He said that the culture of Iran does not allow marriage of its own children
 udhar iran ke adhikari yon shoshan ke pahalu kii taraf dhyaan bhi nahin de rahe hai
 He believes that the purpose of this bill is to liberate adopted girls from the obligation to wear hijab at home
 darasal iran main yah kanoon he ki god lee hui beti ko apane pita ke saamne hijaab pahananaa hota he, jabaki god liye hue bete ke saamne uski maa ko hijaab pahananaa hota he, agar bete kii umr vayaskon kii shrenee vaali he

 There seems to be a general consensus on Nitin Gadkari for the second time in the upcoming BJP Presidential election
 is sambandh main jald hi adhisuchana jari kii jaaegi
 Party sources said that senior leader LK Advani is of the view that Gadkari, who is preparing to file his nomination, should be given the second term as president because there is no consensus on any other candidate
 pichley saptaah tak adwani khemaa or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) aam sahmati se kisi ummidavaar ko chunane main laga tha
 According to sources, Advani, who had objected to handing over a second term to Gadkari, who is facing allegations about the Purti group, had earlier suggested Ravi Shankar Prasad's name for the post

 (input bhashaa se) On this day, it was announced to make Delhi the capital of India

 After which Delhi was officially declared the capital on 13 February 1931
 jaane kaise bani dilli bharat kii rajdhani
 
 
 At that time, the ruler of India, King George v laid the foundation stone in Delhi Durbar on 12 December 1911
 baad main british architect sar harbart baker or sar edwin lutiuns ne nae shahar kii yojana banaai thi
 The plan took two decades to complete
 jiske baad 13 farvari 1931 ko aadhikarik rup se dilli desh kii rajdhani bani
 Somewhere your child is not caught in the travesty of this 'death game', take care of it - such a story is famous about the name of the city of Delhi which is today known as the capital of India
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he dilli shabd farsi ke 'dehalij' se aayaa kyonki dilli ganga ke tarai ilaakon ke liye ek ‘dehalij’tha
 At the same time, some people believe that Delhi was named after Tomar Raja Dhillu
 ek raay ye bhi he ki ek abhishaap ko jhootha siddh karne ke liye raja dhillu ne is shahar kii buniyaad main gadi ek keel ko khudwane kii koshish kii

 Even Lucknow and Hyderabad were considered better than Delhi
 dilli kii mahaj 3 fisadi aabaadi angreji pard paati thi
 For this reason, foreigners also used to visit Delhi less often
 halaat itani kharaab thi ki koi bada aadmi vahaan paisa lagane ko taiyaar nahin tha, lekin bhugolic drushti se desh ke madhya main hone ke kaaran dilli ko rajdhani banane kaa elaan hua
 It was developed for two decades
 - bataa den, samay ke saath dilli ke saat shaharon ke naam se mashhoor , lalkot, mahrauli, siri, tughluqabad, firozabad, deen panaah or shahjahanabad aaj khandhar main tabdeel ho chuke hai, jo dilli ke basane or ujadane kii kahaniyaan kehete hai

 film kaa naam : gali guliyandiarector: deepesh jainster cast: manoj bajpeyi, niraj kabi, shahana goswami, om singh, ranvir shaurievadhi: 1 ghanta 57 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 4 starsaal 2016 main deepesh jain ne 'in da shadows' naam kii ek film nirdeshit kii thi
 The film went to many festivals and also won different awards in many places
 aakhirkaar ab bharat main ise "gali-guliyaan" ke naam se relies kiya ja rahaa he
 Manoj Bajpayee and Neeraj Kabi play the lead roles in the film
 aaie jaanate hai aakhirkaar kisi he film
 Story: The story of the film starts from the streets of Old Delhi where an electrician Khudus (manoj Bajpayee) lives
 uske pados main hameshaa ek pita (niraj kabi) apane bete (om singh) ko berahami se peethta rahata he
 The thing which Khudoos does not like at all
 vah kisi tarah us bachche kii madad karnaa chahta he
 He also enlists the help of his friend (ranveer Shorey) from time to time, with which many aspects are revealed in the story
 aakhirkaar kin vajahon se vah beraham pita apane bete ko martha he or kya is hinsa se khuddus us balak ko bachaa paata he? yah jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Know why you can watch the film: The quality of the film is its story that takes place through many layers, finally ends on a surprise
 diarection laajawab he or jis tarah se dilli kii galiyon ko deepesh jain ne darshaya he lagata hi nahin ki yah unki pehali film he
 The cinematography of the film is good
 darshak puri tarah se kahani main khud ko lipt paaenge
 The screenplay is well written and when things open layer by layer, the story makes one think
 kahin-kahin drone camere kaa prayog he, to kabhi-kabhi long shot or project main chijen or nikhar kar saamne aati hai
 Manoj Bajpayee has done the job of electrician well
 kirdaar main puri tarah se lipt najar aate hai
 Along with this, Neeraj Kabi has played the character of a merciless father, due to which you might even hate him
 pehali baar om singh kisi film main kaam kar rahe hai
 In real life, he is a child brought from an orphanage, played by Deepesh Jain and Manoj Bajpayee in the film
 om singh kaaphi natural abhinay karte hue najar aate hai
 Ranveer Shorey and Shahana Goswami have also acted spontaneously
 kamazor kadiyaan:yah tipical masala film nahin he jisaki vajah se shaayad ek khaas tarah kii audiyans hi is film ko dekhnaa pasand karegi
 At the same time, it is not a film to earn 100 or 200 crores at the box office
 lekin abhinay or kahani kii vajah se jarur saraahi jaaegi
 There is also no song in the film that became famous before its release
 yahi kaaran he ki abhinay or kahani par dhyaan dene vaale darshak bhi is film ko najdiki cinemagharon main khoj paaenge
 Box office: The budget of the film is not much, but its special audience will automatically reach the cinema
 sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne chunaav ayog par sawaal uthaae hai
 He has done this because the Election Commission has not announced by-elections in three of the six Lok Sabha seats
 chunaav ayog ne rajasthan kii ajmer or alvar or pashchim bengal kii uluberia seat par upachunaavon kii ghoshnaa to kar di he
 By-elections have not been announced in Gorakhpur and Phulpur in Uttar Pradesh and Araria seat in Bihar
 upi main gorakhpur kii seat upi ke siem yogi adityanath or phulpur kii seat dipti siem keshav prasad maurya ke upi vidhansabha chale jane se khaali hui thi
 At the same time, Araria seat was vacant after the death of RJD leader Mohammad Taslimuddin
 yechuri ne sabhi chah siton par chunaav ghoshit na karne par chunaav ayog par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 He has said that the same thing was seen in Gujarat assembly elections
 yechuri kaa ishaara gujarat or himachal ke vidhansabha chunaavon main kaaphi antaraal rakhane ko lekar he
 The Election Commission was also criticized by political parties then
 yechuri ne is sambadh main do twit kiye hai
 He has said that questions are being raised on the Election Commission regarding the by-elections to Lok Sabha seats after Gujarat
 unhone kaha he ki loktantr ke liye chunaav ayog kii nishpakshta par sawaal khadey nahin hone chahie
 Moreover, the BJP talks about simultaneous polls across India when it runs scared about simultaneous polls in HP and Gujarat
 Or for Lok Sabha by-polls
 No one expects any better from the BJP but the EC must abide by its constitutional mandate
 — Sitaram Yechury (@sitaramyechury)january 1, 2018ek or twit main yechuri ne kaha he ki bijepi to puure desh main ekasaath chunaav karaane kii baaten karti he
 Whereas it is also afraid to hold elections simultaneously in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh
 yahi dar inhen sabhi chah loksabhaa siton par upachunaav karaane main bhi lagata he
 We saw it in the Gujarat assembly elections, and more questions about the Election Commission now in conduct of by-polls
 For the sake of our democracy, the ec's objectivity and impartiality can't be under a cloud

 Since then, Germany has achieved freedom of the press with great effort
 ye udhaaharan aapako isliye diya ki press kii azaadi ko hasil karne main janata kaa bhi utana hi bada role hota he jitna patrkaar or sampadak kaa
 Perhaps this is why Germany's level of press freedom is higher than India

 You will come to know yourself

 purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi apane raajnneetik kariyar main shandaar netaa ke saath hi apane utkrisht bhaashankala or shandaar kavitaaon ke liye bhi jane jate the
 This is the reason why his words have been used not only by BJP but also by opposition parties from time to time
 vahiin ab sadan main paksh-vipaksh sahuuliyat ke hisaab se istemaal vaajapeyi or unke shabdon kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 On Wednesday, angry over the ruckus during the motion, PM Modi attacked the opposition and said that he will stay where he is, because Vajpayee had said that no one is bigger than a small heart, no one stands by a broken heart
 vahiin somvaar ko naresh agarwal ne bhi sarkaar ko naseehat di thi ki wo vaajapeyi se siikhe ki unhone kya naseehat di thi
 Naresh Aggarwal also used these words of Vajpayee that "atal, Advani made BJP alive, at least remember his words, it will be very good
" atal bihari vaajapeyi ne kaha tha, chote man se koi bada nahin hota or toote man se koi khadaa nahin hota
 Naresh Aggarwal's speech was also appreciated in the House
 naresh agarwal ne apane bhaashan main centrepar waar karte hue kaha tha ki is desh main koi bhi sarkaar hameshaa nahin rahegi
 Make your heart big, take everyone along
 sabko janaa he
 Naresh formula was also practiced in this country
 hamane hi kalyaan kii sarkaar bana di thi, jo nahin ban rahi thi
 On the other hand, PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday attacked the opposition in a tone of anger
 unhone is dauraan kai shaayari bhi kahi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a statement in Parliament on Wednesday on the President's address
 loksabhaa main piem modi ke bayaan se pehle hi vipakshi sadasyon ne narebaaji shuru kar di
 Noise did not diminish even as PM Modi stood up and opposition mps shouted slogans in the House
 piem modi ke bayaan ke dauraan sadan main bijepi kii sahyogi tidipi ke saansad bhi narebaaji karte rahe
 During this time, shouting slogans like stop drama, stop false promises and stop bullying
 yahaan tak ki jumalebaji band karo jaise naare bhi goonjte rahe
 Along with this, slogans like stop false speech and stop match fixing are also heard
 piem modi ne kaha ki abhibhaashan ke baad jo charchaa hui he, usapar paksh-vipaksh donon taraf se baaten kahin gai hai
 Modi said that there has been meaningful discussion in the House, but it is to be seen how appropriate it is to protest only for protest
 unhone kaha ki raashtrapati kisi dal yaa party ke nahin hote hai
 States in our country were also composed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he created three states but there was no ruckus
 kisi bhi rajya ko koi bhi samasya nahin hui thi
 PM Modi said that when you (congress) partitioned India and cut the country and the poison that you sowed, this uproar is happening
 piem modi ne is dauraan atal bihari vaajapeyi kii baat ko doharaaya
 He said that no one is greater than a small mind, no one stands by a broken heart
 unhone kaha ki 80 ke dashak main 21veen sadi ke sapane dikhaai jate the, lekin wo sarkaar is desh main aviation policy bhi nahin laa pai
 Today our government is connecting small cities of the country by airways
 aaj desh main kareeb 450 jahaaj oparational hai, is saal hamane 900 se zyada hawaii jahaaj kharidne ke order die hai
 Even though he joined the right-wing BJP during his political career, today the way BJP is using former veteran Congress leaders like Vallabhbhai Patel for his own benefit
 vahiin vipakshi party bhi is maamle main peeche nahin he or usne atal bihari vaajapeyi ke kaamon ko bhale hi hijank na kiya ho, lekin unke shabd jarur apnaanaa shuru kar diya he
 The statement of Naresh Aggarwal of Samajwadi is just an example, but the Congress and other opposition parties have started using words uttered by former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and veteran leader LK Advani for their own benefit, while learning from BJP

 He has taken a good lead in the first innings
 yadi ve 125 yaa 150 ran par bhi out ho jate hai tab bhi unke paas wicket hasil karne ke liye paryaapt score hoga

 The first day could not be played in a way

 The protests over the closure of Vedanta Sterlite's copper plant at Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu for the past 100 days have turned violent
 pradarshnakariyon kii mangalvaar shaam police se takaraav kii sthiti paidaa ho gai or kai gadiyon ko aag ke hawaale kar diya gaya
 The law and order situation in Thoothukudi deteriorated so much that the police had to fire, killing 9 people and injuring about 30 people
 aakhir kyon beete 100 dinon ne tutikorin main chal rahaa he pradarshan or kyon maamla itnaa gambhir ho gaya ki police ko goli chalanaa ke vikalp chunanaa padaa
 Copper Plant Here Situation, about 4 lakh tonnes of copper cathode is produced every year from Vedanta Sterlite's copper plant
 is plant kaa sanchaalan landan main listed vedanta limited kii ikai vedanta limited dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The copper plant was closed for maintenance for 15 days on 27 March
 darasal vedanta is plant kii kshamta main ijapha karte hue isse lagbhag 8 lakh ton copper cathod kaa utpaadan karnaa chaahati he
 After the Pollution Control Board ceased production from the plant on March 27, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board revoked the license to restart the plant from April, saying that Vedanta violated the Regional Law of Environmental Protection
 haalanki polution board ke is faisle ko sterlite kii taraf se chunauti di gai he
 After which the Pollution Board has postponed the next hearing of the case till June 6
 gauratlab he ki board ne sterlite company par aarope lagaaya he ki sterlite ne plant se nikalne vaale copper slag ko nadi main baha diya or ground water par padane vaale prabhaav par report jari nahin kiya
 This is not the first time that this copper plant has been closed
 isse pehle 2013 main bhi plant ko kai hafton ke liye tab band kiya gaya tha jab naishanal green tribunel main iske khilaaf paryaavaran ko nuksaan pahunchnaa kaa maamla chal rahaa tha
 Why is the plant opposing? In Tuticorin, the regional people have been demonstrating to close the copper plant for the last 100 days
 is pradarshan ke dauraan unhone mangalvaar ko tutikorin ke collector offis main dharna dene kaa elaan kiya tha
 In Tuticorin district, protests against this plant have been going on at different places for the last few months
 kshetreey log is plant kii kshamta badaye jane kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Apart from this, the protesters claim that due to this plant, the level of pollution in ground water has increased in the entire area
 kuch pradarshnakariyon ne daawa kiya he ki polution control board ne vedanta ko choti chimney ke saath plant chalaane kii anumati di he jiske chalate pradooshan kaa str bad gaya he
 The small chimney is helping the company to save expenses and people have to bear the cost of this due to poor level of water source
 vedanta kii safayeesterlite copper ke siio pi ramnath ne daawa kiya he ki plant ne paryaavaran santhaan niri or supreme court dwaara lagaai gai sabhi sharton kaa paalan kiya he
 With this, Ramnath said that now his company is going to meet the benchmark set by the International Finance Corporation
 company ne daawa kiya he ki unke plant se paryaavaran ko kisi tarah kaa nuksaan nahin pahunch rahaa he
 The Sterlite CEO said that he is ready to open his plant to the investigating agencies so that the rumors of pollution leveled against him can be proved completely baseless
 haalanki pradarshnakariyon ne company ke is prastaav ko yah kehete hue thukraa diya he ki samasya copper plant ke andar nahin he balki plant se jal shrot or paryaavaran ko ho rahaa nuksaan he
 The Tuticorin Stevedores Association of employees at the Chidambaranar Port Trust in Tuticorin, opposing the closure of the plant, has urged the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu to start copper production at the plant at the earliest
 is association kaa daawa he ki plant ko band kiye jane se hajaaron kii sankhya main port par kaam karne vaale mazdooron ke saamne berogari kii samasya khadi ho gai he
 According to the association, the Vedanta copper plant is the most important of the companies sending their goods to this port
 iske saath hi association kaa daawa he ki vedanta plant band ho jane kii sthiti main copper se sambandhit kai choti factriyaan prabhavit hongi
 Due to their stagnation, the question of employment will arise in front of the people working in the factories
 plant band hone se copper kii keemat main ijafavedanta kaa plant band ho jane ke baad metal market main copper kii keemton main ijapha darj ho rahaa he
 This plant of Vedanta has a capacity to produce 4 lakh tonnes per year
 is utpaadan kshamta ke saath copper market main lagbhag 35 fisadi kaarobaar par is company kii pakad he
 Apart from this, copper is exported from this company to many Asian countries including Gulf countries
 vahiin desh main copper kii khapat beete kuch varshon se lagaataar bad rahi he
 Exports will be closed, depending on imports
 According to the data, the demand for copper in the country increases by about 7 to 8 percent per year
 vahiin ikraa kii april main ai report ke mutabik jahaan bharat abhi copper kaa niryaat kar rahaa he, yadi vedanta ke is plant ko band kiya jaataa he to niryaat buree tarah prabhavit hoga
 Along with this, the country will be compelled to take its own needs through copper imports

 ’india today ne desh ke vibhaajan kii maang se judi fasebuk poston ko lekar tathyon kii padtaal ke silsile main dobaaraa jilani se mulaakaat kii
 AIMPLB Secretary Jilani dismissed all such content on social media as fake news

 We do not want to live anywhere other than India

 'clearly, AIMPLB has not made any demand for a separate homeland for Muslims

 Ramaiya, who devoted his entire life to plantation, has planted 1 crore saplings

 Initially he did this by planting many trees and saplings in the area of four kilometers in the east and west direction of his village, but where was he going to stop
 vah ek ke baad ek ped lagaate rahe
 Children understand the guarding of trees, guarding the trees and plants as their child
 unhone apni jimmedaari sirf vriksh lagane tak hi simit nahin rakhi hai, balki ve swayan ped-paudhon kii dekh-rekh bhi karte hai
 If a tree dries then they also suffer a lot
 ye in pedo ko vaaki apane bachche ke samaan samajhate hai
 Therefore, these trees take good care of them even when they are happy and do not stop the process of planting new trees
 jamiya ke kulapati ko mila life time achievement awordamila padmashri awardermaiya ne apana puri jivan paudhe lagane or unki dekhbhaal karne main samarpit kar diya
 In view of his passion towards him, the Central Government has been honored with the Padma Shri Award

 According to the application, 'the order of January 12 is sought to be reconsidered as there is a considerable possibility that the judgment (retired) Justice Chatterjee's attitude was biased and thus he was automatically required to hear the case
 He is disqualified
 ’aavedan main nyaayamurti alam ke bare main kaha gaya he ki ‘yadi vah is tathy se waakif the ki nyaayamurti chatarji ayogy hai to unhen bhi khud maamle se hat janaa chaiye tha
 Some of the points raised in Shah's application have also been raised in the remedial petition filed by senior IPS officer Geeta Johri who alleged that the CBI was proceeding in a special political manner in the case
 johari kii tarah hi purv mantri shah ne bhi aarope lagaaya ki sibiai gavaahon par ek vishesh tareeke se gavaahi ke liye dabaav bana rahi he
 Like Jauhari, he also demanded the removal of Balwinder Singh, the special director of the CBI, from the investigation

 He said that the most shocking aspect of the CBI investigation is that Balwinder Singh who should have answered the questions of the investigators in the Sohrabuddi encounter case regarding the role of Andhra Pradesh Police is himself monitoring the investigation and Geeta Johri who Being the head of the Gujarat CID, who was investigating the case and wanted to interrogate Balwinder, she is now facing questions

 The former home minister said that there are 700 encounter cases in the country but the top court only took up the Sohrabuddin Sheikh case
 shah kaa aarope he, ‘gujarat dangon ke maamalon main gujarat sarkaar or iske mukhyamantri kii chhavi kharaab karne main naakaam rahane par congress party or iske netritv vaali centre sarkaar ne ab isi durbhaavnapurna manshaa ke kaaran 2002 se 2007 ke bich puure bharat main hue saat sau se adhik muthbhed ke maamalon main se soharabuddin maamle ko hi chunaa he
 On August 12, Jethmalani questioned the order of the apex court, stating that it was given by a bench of a judge who himself is under the scanner of the agency in the criminal case
 haalanki shah kii taraf se arji daakhil karne ke liye maamle main ek din ke sthagan ke unke anurodh par vichaar nahin kiya gaya tha
 Justice Alam also objected to his plea
 peeth ne jethmalani kii is daleel ko nahin mana ki maamle main jaanch ke liye sibiai ko or adhik samay nahin dena chahie
 The CBI has questioned not only Shah but many senior police officers

 desh main krishi sankat he hi or monsoon ke morche se bhi kuch acchhee khabar nahin aa rahi he
 Although the countdown for the monsoon starts from the month of May, the arrival of the weather forecast in the country, Skymet may delay the arrival of the monsoon
 skymet ke mutabik, is saal monsoon ko kerala tat par pahunchane main ise tayshuda taarikh se thodi der hogi
 Normally the monsoon arrives on the Kerala coast on June 1, but this time Skymet predicts that it will come on June 4
 iske bainks, bhartiya mausam vibhaag (iemdi) monsoon ko or bhi let bataa rahaa he
 According to IMD, the date of arrival of monsoon on the Kerala coast is 6 June
 isamen 4 dinon kaa aagaa-peechha ho saktaa he
 According to Mahesh Palawat, Vice President at Skymet, "the immediate reason for the slight delay in the monsoon is that a counter-cyclone is forming in the east-central Arabian Sea
 lekin monsoon ke aane or barsaat main thodi kami kii asli vajah al nino kaa asar he
 Systems such as cyclones or per-cyclones are completed in three to four days
 usase hui deree bahut myne nahin rakhti
 But the real effect on the monsoon is El Nino
 "beete barason main monsoon ke purvanumaan ko lekar, khaskar kerala tat par uske pahunchane kii bhavishyavaanee kii sateekta par sawaal uthaae jate hai par iemdi main vaigyanik em mahapatra kehete hai, "2015 ko chhod den to pichley 14 saal (2005-2018) se hamane monsoon ke aagaman kii sateek bhavishyavaanee kii he
 An indigenous statistical model has been used since 2005 to predict the arrival of the monsoon, which is accurate
 "gauratlab he ki 2015 main iemdi ne kerala tat par monsoon ke aane kii taarikh 30 may bataai thi, jab asal main monsoon 5 june ko aayaa tha
 IMD predicted the onset of monsoon on 5 June 2014, 7 June 2016, 30 May 2017, and 29 May 2018 in 2018, and its arrival date was 6 June in 2014 and 8 June 2016
 2017 or 2018 main bataai tarikhon par hi monsoon aayaa tha
 So can it reduce the rain in the country? The answer is yes or no
 ashankaayen hai ki is baar monsoon saamaanya se kam ho saktaa he
 Palawat says, "late monsoon does not mean a decrease in the amount of rain
 par itnaa he ki is baar barish saamaanya se kam hogi
 Our prediction was rainy to 93 per cent of the normal and we are keeping that
 " mahapatra bhi kehete hai, "monsoon ke aade or barish kii maatra main koi sambandh nahin he
 "it is not fair to say right now whether the rain will be less or not," says Mahapatra
 june ke pehle hafte main ham duusare daur kaa purvanumaan jari karke hi kuch thos bataa paaenge
 "significantly, the Meteorological Department had predicted 96 per cent of the monsoon to be normal, which is considered normal
 mausam vigyaan kii bhashaa main 96 se 104 fisadi tak barish main monsoon ko saamaanya or 90 se 96 fisadi barsaat ko saamaanya se kam mana jaataa he
 Both Skymet and the Meteorological Department believe that El Niño in the Pacific Ocean will affect rain in India
 scymet ke mutabik, monsoon ke saamaanya se kam rahane (93%) rahane kii sambhaavna 55 pratishat tak he
 According to the agency, there is a 15 percent probability of drought in the country
 palavat kehete hai, "isaki ek vajah al nino he
 If El Niño is effective on the global weather, in simple terms it causes less rain in India and rain is good if there is a La Niña effect
 "asal main, al nino purvi prashanth tat main argentina tat par uthne vaali ek garm mahasagariya dhara he
 When it is effective, the surface temperature in the eastern Pacific Ocean increases and the temperature of the sea decreases in the Indian Ocean, the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, that is, in Southeast Asia
 to isse badal kam banate hai
 Obviously the amount and intensity of rain will be less
 palavat saaf karte hai, "al nino kaa asar june se july madhya tak rahegaa
 But after that the monsoon will come in its tone
 "kharif fasal par asarhaalanki mausam vibhaag abhi monsoon ke saamaanya rahane kii baat par kaayam he
 But a decrease in the amount of monsoon can leave a bad effect in a country that is suffering from agrarian crisis
 pichley saal mausam vibhaag ne saamaanya kaa 87 fisadi barsaat (saamaanya) hone kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi lekin vaastavik barsaat saamaanya kaa 91 fisadi hi rahi thi
 As a result, the kharif sowing decreased last year
 krishi mantralay ne pichley june main bataaya tha ki usase pichley saal kii tulana main kharif kii buaai main 20 fisadi kii kami ai thi
 *** agle maheene se privet provident trust vaale karmchaariyon ke liye bhi online acount transfar kii suvidha shuru hone ja rahi he
 There are about 2,750 such trusts in the country

 The Information Services Branch of the Employees Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) is currently developing an online transfer mechanism
 yah suvidha chah hafte ke andar laanch kar di jaaegi
 With this help, employees will be able to transfer their PF account from private trusts if they change company
 philhal yah suvidha sirf un companiyon ke karmchaariyon ko hi mil rahi he, jinke acount kaa prabandhan ipiefo karata he
 Central PF Commissioner KK Jalan gave information about the scheme in a meeting of zone commissioners last month
 ipiefo ne online transfar clem portal do oktober ko laanch kiya tha
 But it does not yet have transfer facility for the employees of the companies which are managing the PF themselves
 har saal kareeb 13 lakh log acount transfar ke clem karte hai
 The pace of changing jobs in the IT sector is high
 isliye sabase zyada transfar clem ipiefo ko vahiin se milte hai
 By providing online facility, not only will the employees be ease, but the EPFO will also get freedom from paperwork
 ipiefo ne 2012-13 ke dauraan 1

 Over 200 bridges were broken

 Cloud burst and lake water also rose in the valley
 kedarnath ke aage 20 kilometre ke strtch main gaurinath tak sab nasht ho gaya
 Many people have died

 Answer: We know that there are many people left, trapped

 Badrinath and Gagaria share the same situation
 bachaav ke liye rajya sarkaar ne bhi 12 helicopter kiraaye par liye hai
 But it has to be understood that only a certain number of helicopters can fly in one air area at a time
 main to airforce or civillian adhikariyon ko badhai duungaa ki ve tamaam mushkilon ke baad bhi helicopter land kar rahe hai
 Landing in very small and difficult parts
 magar ye bahut badi samasya he
 People from all over the country are here

 hamaara bas yahi kahana he ki jo surakshit jagahon par hai
 They should not be disturbed

 The state government is doing nothing
 
 
 javabalmain logon kii chintaaon kii prashansa karata hum
 It is difficult here
 ye pahari aria he, maidan nahin
 So there is a problem
 sadaken bachi nahin hai
 We can give food and water only by air
 choper udaane kii bhi limit he
 Will take some time
 main local logon se apil kar rahaa hum ki ve aage aaen or fanse hue tourist kii madad karen
 We have provided free lodging and food at every guest house
 transport free he
 By road or by train we are sending people back
 hamen paison yaa sansadhano kii dikkat nahin he
 The problem is how to deliver it
 deliver kaise karen
 This is what we are doing with the help of the Army
 sawalbhyah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki is aapadaa kii vajah log hai
 Constant construction is being done on the banks of the river
 aise main jab barish hoti he, to nadi apana paat nahin badha paati or vinaash hone lagata he
 Answer: These are also a way of looking at things
 magar practical baat ye he ki agar dehradun main ek din main 330 mimi barish hui, to ye main maid kaise he
 Badal burst in Kedarnath, so how are these manmade
 nadiyon ke kinare uttarkashi or rudraprayag sadiyon se based hai
 The issue here is of river bed
 court ke adeshon ke chalate mining par roak lagi hui he
 In such a situation, boulders are constantly falling in the river
 doosraa material aa rahaa he isamen
 We cannot pick them up
 isse dhime dhime nadi kaa tal upar aa rahaa he
 This is why water is breaking and breaking the coast and flowing out
 main maanata hum ki nadi kinare nirmaan nahin hona chahie
 i am not anti-environment

 Can not tease them

 And these projects that are going on
 inhen centre sarkaar ke mantralayon se anumati mili he
 We have to see the development of the people along with the environment
 varna log us halaat main bhi gussa honge
 Our economy is dependent on tourism and hydro power
 tourism ke liye nirmaan hoga, tabhi nivesh aayega
 The environment will also be taken care of amidst all this
 sawaldaye bataaie ki rajya main sthit saamaanya kab tak ho paaegi?javabzarkiyological survey vaale kedarnath mandir ko dekhenge
 They have to estimate how much construction will have to be done
 isamen jo bhi kharch aayega, rajya sarkaar uthaaegi
 My guess is that we will safely evacuate all survivors in two weeks
 iske liye sadak network ke alaava helicopteron kaa istemaal hoga
 The rest will have to be seen that villages, water lines, power structures
 sadakon ko kitna nuksaan hua he
 Nothing can be said about it properly, but it is certain that it will take a lot of time

 ' Carrying his question further, Garrat asked, "only last week the chairman of the Joint Chiefs staff said that Iran should not get any exemption in the case of conventional weapons or ballistic missiles
" jis tarah se ye deal hui usase aisa lagata he ki ye baatcheet ke dauraan kiya gaya antim samay kaa aatmasamarpan he
 Many people in the Pentagon believe that you left the chairman of the joint staff in the middle, can you comment on this? ' iske jawaab main obama ne kaha, 'major aap jis chaalaaki se sawaal karte hai uske liye mujhe aapako badhai deni chahie
 i have met the families of those four people incarcerated in Iran and no one is happy with this situation
 hamaare rajanyik or duusari timen is dauraan lagaataar un logon ko vahaan se baahar nikaalane ke liye kaam kar raheen hai

 If we had done this, Iran would have felt that it could get more exemption in return for the release of these citizens from us
 isse hamaari mushkilen or bad jaati
 Iran currently understands that this nuclear deal rests entirely on the nuclear issue and not on anyone else
 'tippaniyan According to Obama, 'if we had wandered a bit from the nuclear deal, it would have been difficult for us to get these citizens out of there

 pentagon main maujuud kai logon kaa maananaa he ki aapane joint staff ke chairman ko bich manjhdhaar main chhod diya, kya aap is par coment kar sakate hai?' In response, Obama said, 'major, i must congratulate you for the cleverness you ask
 main iran main qaid un chaar logon ke pariwaron se mil chukaa hum or is halaat se koi bhi kush nahin he
 Our diplomats and other teams are constantly working to get those people out there

 agar ham aisa karte to iran ko lagata ki wo hamase in nagarikon kii rihaai ke badale main or chhot paa saktaa he
 This would increase our difficulties

 nae bharat kaa andolan modi ne nahin shuru kiya
 Kejriwal and Anna together with their liver blew the new India movement
 anna kaa aamaran anshan 1947 ke baad desh ke itihaas kaa sabase prabhaavshaalee anshan tha
 a fast whose live coverage brought millions of households together for a big fight for the first time
 ye vahi mode tha jahaan bijepi or congress donon dar kar sansad ke dadbe main chup gai thi or modi kahin seen main nahin the
 If Kejriwal had moved ahead with Anna and Kiran Bedi at this point, perhaps in 2014, his mayor would have been something else in the politics of India
 agast kranti ke andolan ke vakt kejariwal or anna kii deewangi kaa alam ye tha ki unki ek lalkaar par hindustan bicha ja rahaa tha
 Mantras were not coming out of his mouth
 unke ishaare par ghatnakram badal rahaa tha
 Rajpath was dancing on his fingers
 ye sara sho kejariwal kaa tha
 All this movement came out of Kejriwal's blue-print
 anna andolan kaa cheharaa bane the or kiran bedi uski saakh
 But the tide of ambitions engulfed the country's most historic mass movement
 kisi kaa ahankaar to kisi kii jid andolan ke liye aatmghaatee ban gai
 Kiran Bedi and Kejriwal both woke up to the fame gained overnight and Anna was swept away by the crowds
 shaayad ye sabhi haisiyat se oonchi chalaang laga chuke the or hawa main balance kho baithe
 a person was reborn from the ashes of this movement
 wo vyakti narendra damodar das modi tha jisane dilli main bikhri sarkaar, bikhare vipaksh or bikhare hue ek andolan ke shunya ko bharne main der nahi kii
 Like a lion ambushed and waiting for a chance
 waisi hi modi ne mauka pate hi jindagi kaa sabase bada daanv khelaa
 Kejriwal had lost a live bet by parting with his original comrades and Modi went ahead by burning the sparks extinguished in the ashes of his movement
 safalataa ke bich khud ko sanbhaalanaa hi sabase badi chunauti he
 Like a child in power, there is no insistence on asking for the moon
 chand or mangal jeetne kii baat hoti he
 Like a child in power, the chair is not hit
 kursi kaa ikbaal kaayam kiya jaataa he
 In 2002, a repentance was made by Modi
 ab 2014 main ek pashchaatap kejariwal ko karnaa hoga
 There is no tainted challenge like Mulayam, Mayawati or Pawar for Modi
 modi ke liye asli chunauti kejariwal hi hai
 The truth is that Modi is necessary to run the country
 modi ko check karne ke liye kejariwal

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special news letter bhartiya naagarik kulbhushan jadhav ko faansee kii sajaa ko lekar duniya bhar main ho rahi aalochana or bharat kii chetavanee ke bich pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne sena pramukh qamar javed bajva se mulaakaat kii he
 An official source said that the army chief had called him for a meeting to take Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif into confidence in Jadhav's case
 vahiin pakistani media kii report ke mutabik, is mulaakaat main donon ne kisi dabaav ke aage naa jhukne kii baat kahi
 Jadhav, 46, has been sentenced to death under the Army Act for his alleged involvement in terrorism and espionage on behalf of the Military Field General Court Martial in Pakistan
 pakistani sena pramukh general qamar javed bajva ne maut kii sajaa kii pushti kii thi
 India termed the Pakistani army's move to prostrate Najadhav to death

 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj gave a clear warning to Islamabad that if Jadhav's punishment is implemented, his relations with New Delhi will be directly affected
 sushamaa ne jadhav ko bachaane ke liye kisi bhi had tak jane kii baat kahi thi
 Pakistan alleges that Jadhav was arrested on March 3, 2016 from Balochistan, where he was working for RAW
 haalanki bharat kaa kahana he ki jadhav ko iran se agava kiya gaya
 Asaram has been inside the jail for the past nearly two-and-a-half years
 yon shoshan ke iljaam main
 Later, behind the father, son Narayan Sai was also taken to jail in a similar charge
 in donon ke jail jane ke baad se ab tak kul saat-saat gavaahon par jaanaleva hamalaa ho chukaa he
 Two of them were murdered
 ab sabase taaja hamalaa narayan sai ke purv pie par hua he, jinhen panipat main unke ghar main ghus kar hamalaavaron ne do goli maari
 Three things are very strange with all these characters
 pehla to ye ki ye sabhi ke sabhi rape or paakhand ke ilzaamon se ghire tathakthith sant asaram yaa phir unke bete narayan sai ke kareebi rah chuke hai
 Secondly, they all dared to speak the truth against Asaram and his son Narayan Sai and came forward as witnesses
 teesraa ye ki in aath main se do ko gumnaam kaatilon ne maut ke ghat utaar diya, jabaki baaki chah khud par hue jaanaleva hamale main bal-bal bache hai
 But are these common things of all the characters just a coincidence? Or is it the truth behind it, whose discussion is common and keeping in mind the aspect, the police itself is also investigating these attacks and murder cases
 wo pahalu he, asaram baapu yaa phir unke bete narayan sai ke khilaaf bolne par in sabhi ko ek-ek kar yaa to raste se hataaya ja rahaa he yaa phir hataane kii koshish ho rahi he
 The biggest question is that if this is not the case, then why and how are the attacks on so many people opening their mouths against the father-son going to jail? goliyon se ye hamalaa abaki kisi or par nahin balki khud narayan sai ke purv pie mahendra chawla par hua he
 But before we talk about the trouble and this dreadful device against those who testify against Asaram and Narayan Sai, let us first listen to Asaram's latest speech
 pichley kareeb do saal se jodhpur jail main band asaram kii shikaayat he ki jab salmaan khan ko jamaanat mil sakati he to unke jaise sant ko kyon nahin?mahendra chawla un chuninda logon main ek he, jisane tamaam dhatakarmon ke ilzaamon se ghire baap-bete yani asaram or narayan sai ke khilaaf munh kholane kii himmat kii thi
 Now that the risk is greater, the police also felt that an attempt could be made to harm Chawla
 lihaaja, police chawla ke saath surakshaguard kii tainaati bhi karti he
 But despite this, Hamalwar targets Mahendra Chawla with his bullets
 mahendra chawla naam ke shaks ko do nakaabposh hamalaavaron ne buudhvaar ko uske ghar main ghuskar apni goliyon kaa nishaanaa bana hi daalaa
 While shooting him, the attackers said that Alenia said that this is just a punishment for opening mouth or witnessing against Asaram Bapu and Narayan Sai
 
 
 sajaa-e-maut
 But with his good luck and bravery, Mahendra Chawla is still not only alive, but has also told the entire story of the attack on himself to the police
 chhattisgarh main naksaliyon ne IED or barudi surang ko bachaane ke liye nayaa nuskhaa ijad kiya he
 Naxalites are now putting animal flesh on top of the IED and landmines
 taaki uski badboo se suraksha balon ke snifer dogs bhatak jaaen
 In fact, daily police and central security forces personnel in Bastar are finding IED and landmines through their sniffer dogs
 isse naksaliyon ke armaanon par pani phir jaataa he
 Not only this, the stock of explosive material of Naxalites is also decreasing
 haalanki police or kendriya suraksha balon ke javaanon ne naksaliyon ke is tarkeeb kaa bhi tod nikaal liya he
 They are making their move within the forest with cautious steps
 pehle kii tarah IED ab bhi nikal rahi hai, lekin suraksha balon ke jawan or snifer dogs kahin zyada sajag ho gaye hai
 According to DIG p Sundaraj of Bastar range, the security forces have found the break in this recipe of Naxalites
 unke mutabik suraksha balon kii sakriyata or chaak chaukas chahalkadami se naksaliyon ke paas maujuud visphotak saamagree kaaphi ghat gayi he
 Naxalites within the jungle in Bastar have now started killing mute animals as well
 jangal ke kai hisson main junglee jaanwaron se lekar ghar main paale jane vaale maweshiyon ke sade gale shav suraksha balon ko aksar jagah-jagah dikhaai dene lage hai
 Before this, villagers usually buried their carcasses in the ground, but now the Naxalites and their allies are taking the carcasses of the pets with them as soon as they get information
 phir us shav se maance nikaal kar use choti badi iidi main lep kar diya jaataa he
 Naxalites have also worked to make Rambo Arrow and conventional arrows more deadly
 unhone ab usamen pataakhon main istemaal hone vaali barood ko tir ke saamne ke hisse main lagaana shuru kar diya he
 The arrow released by it sounds like a firework
 muthbhed sthal main isse hone vaali aawaaj or dhuen se police or kendriya suraksha balon ke jawan kuch der ke liye achambhit ho jate hai
 They have the impression of a large explosion from the arrow released together
 iske pehle tak ve audyogic upyog main aane vaale visphotakon kaa upyog karte the
 Police and central security forces personnel in Bastar have turned their full attention on the changed tactics and exercises of the Naxalites
 ab suraksha balon ke jawan pehle se kahin zyada satark or chaak chaukas ho gaye hai
 Not only sniffer dogs, but the steps of the soldiers are very tight
 jaraa si chook jaanaleva sabit ho sakati he
 So they have also adapted themselves to the changed strategy

 " Their exploratory journey began a month ago, and during this time, these people have sifted through Dehradun, Rishikesh and Rudraprayag, but the hope is not fulfilled
 
 
 phir bhi himmat na haarate hue ye donon sonprayag pahunch gaye, jahaan kedarnath jane ke liye gadiyon vaali sadak khatm ho jaati he
 
 
 Saurabh is actually searching for 23-year-old Richa Tripathi, her parents and 14 others
 
 
 saurabh ke anusaar, "hamaare bich (saurabh or richa ke bich) aaj se saat saal pehle pyaar hua tha
 
 
 We also got married in the year 2011, but against the wishes of their parents
 
 
 " By the way, the town of Sonprayag, known for the confluence of the Vasuki and Mandakini rivers, has been completely destroyed
 
 
 vahaan dur-dur tak koi insaan dikhaai nahin detaa
 
 
 At the moment, only collapsed houses, shops and guest houses are visible here
 
 
 jahaan bazaar hua karata tha, vahaan sirf lohe ke garder, or ret dikh rahi he
 
 
 Heads of footwear, shoes and other belongings of the unfortunate people are seen on the only road left in a condition of walking
 
 
 maahaul aisa he ki us behad dahala dene vaali prakruthik aapadaa ko aaj bhi aasaani se mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he
 
 
 But 24-year-old software engineer Saurabh Mishra's unbridled love and firm intentions are clearly visible
 
 
 is maahaul main bhi vah lagbhag har jagah poster chipakaata gum rahaa he, jin par richa kii tasviir, kuch phone number or 10,000 rupee ke inaam kii ghoshnaa chhapi hui he
 
 
 Saurabh says, "I am not sure that anything could happen to them, because i constantly feel that they are absolutely safe
" 
 
 yahaan aise bahut-se gaanv hai, jahaan sanchaar kaa koi saadhan nahin he, so, ho saktaa he, ve kahin fanse hue hon, ho saktaa he, ghayal hon, yaa ho saktaa he, unhen kisi ne panaah de di ho
 
 
 " itane bhayankar vinaash ko dekhte hue bhi vah ummid haarane ke liye isliye taiyaar nahin he, kyonki ab to uske or richa ke mata-pita ne bhi haar maan lee he, or sabake saamne unki shaadi karwaane ke liye haa kar di he
