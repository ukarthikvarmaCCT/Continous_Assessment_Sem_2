 beete guuruuvaar ko pulavama main hue bhayanak aatanki hamale ke baad congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne rashtriya suraksha par ek task force banaai he
 The task force will be headed by Lt General (retd) DS Hooda
 dies hooda sargical strike kii us team kaa hissaa rah chuke hai jisane 2016 main pakistani aatanki lonchpad par hamalaa kiya tha
 This task force will give its opinion to the Congress on national security
 isaki report chunaav se pehle aegi jise congress apane chunavi ghoshnaa patr main shaamil kar sakati he
 This task force will have many experts from different fields who will give their opinion on national security
 dies hooda ne guuruuvaar ko india today ke kansalting editor rajdeep saradesai se baat kii
 He explained the task force in detail and also made it clear that he is part of the task force but not joining Congress
 hooda ne kaha, 'philhal meraa kaam task force join karnaa he
 This team will have many experts from different fields
 military, diplomasi or police bal se jude log isamen shaamil honge
 Everyone will try to make a special strategy on the issue of security in the country
 philhal chunauti yahi he ki task force ke liye kaise koi ranneeti banaai jaae
 Our focus is on how the task force should work for the next five years on the issue of security and diplomacy
 main congress party join nahin kar rahaa hum
 'india Today asked Hooda, is it a bilateral matter in which the task force will give suggestions to both the government and the opposition
 yaa phir congress party ko suzav dena he ki suraksha par koi ranneeti bane taaki bhavishya main pulavama jaisi ghatana na ho
 In response, DS Hooda said, 'the task force will make some policies that can give some directions to the security policies of the country
 is bare main maine rahul gandhi se baat kii thi
 He suggested to make it, which i agreed to
 isse judi report ek baar hamaare paas aa jaae to public main iske bare main sabakuch bataaya jayega
 Hooda said in a special conversation with India Today that "I think it's a good thing that the talks are going on on national security
" yah kuch aisa he jiske bare main desh ko kaaphi pehle se jarurat thi
 After the full report of the Task Force, it will be discussed in detail, opinion of the people will be taken and it will also be rectified if needed
 yah acchhee baat hogi ki sabhi log ise dekh-sun or samaj sakenge
 Rajdeep Sardesai asked Hooda that if you are working on this plan of Rahul Gandhi, then it can also be named as Congress Policy Group
 ho saktaa he aap jo sakaaratmak suzav denge use raajnneetik maanakar sarkaar ko apnaane main dikkat aae
 This issue can also be politically polarized
 aap kya is chintaa main hai ki aapkaa naam congress-bijepi ke bich funs gaya he? is par hooda ne kaha, 'chintaaen to sab jagah hoti hai lekin yakeen ho ki aap kuch acha kar rahe hai yaa rashtrahit main kar rahe hai to aisi chintaaen darkinar kii ja sakati hai
 i want to make it clear that the Congress President suggested to form a task force
 pulavama hamale ke kaaphi pehle is par baat hui thi
 Therefore, we cannot see it directly connected to Pulwama
 'aglaa sawaal tha, kya pulavama hamale ke kaaphi pehle is par baat hui thi
 Do you believe that surgical strike-2 will be needed because the martyrdom of the soldiers continues, terrorist attacks are also taking place
 aise main is task force par in ghatnaon kaa kya asar padegaa? is par hooda ne kaha ki 'mere dimag main yah baat jarur he ki pulavama hamale ke baad kuch karrwai honi chahie
 The government has also said that it will take further action
 sab log aage aa rahe hai or milakar saath dene kii baat kar rahe hai
 Certainly now the thing will not be the former, which has been happening till now
 'is par rajdiv saradesai ne sawaal poocha ki iskaa matlab kya yah lagaana chahie ki sarkaar aatankwaad ke khilaaf koi munhtod jawaab degi
 Or should we be cautious before taking any action? On this, Hooda said that we should take a thoughtful decision at every step
 mujhe puraa bharosa he ki jo log athurity main hai, sena se baatcheet karne ke baad koi kadam uthaaenge
 i believe that no decision should be taken after seeing the sentiment of the people
 haa, hamen kuch na kuch kadam jarur uthaane chahie
 What can be its options, what will be its reaction later, it should be seriously discussed
 yah ekatarfa prakriya nahin he isliye soch samaj kar aage badhanaa hoga lekin meraa yah bhi maananaa he ki ab haath par haath dhar kar baithne kaa samay nahin
 Intelligence failure is being questioned after the Pulwama attack
 300 kilo visphotak ghatana sthal par kaisaa pahunchaa, is par bhi sawaal poocha ja rahaa he
 Whether or not such questions should be raised in public is also being debated
 is par hooda ne jawaab diya ki aise sawaal puche jane main koi buraai nahin he lekin usase zyada jaruri he ki ham beeti baton par focus na karen
 There should be talk on what should be done to prevent such incidents
 beeti kisi ghatana par baat karne se mudde kaa hal nahin nikalegaa
 The final question is whether you think the task force report will come before the election and will be part of the manifesto, or is this case going to be a long one
 iske jawaab main hooda ne kaha ki chunaav se pehle report aegi, isliye ham 30 din kaa timefrem maanakar chal rahe hai
 i met Rahul Gandhi
 ve is mudde par dilchaspee le rahe hai isliye task force par samahati bani he

 That's why it was a lot of fun to do this film

 i have always urged the government that martial arts should be made compulsory in school
 singapore main skulon main marshall art kaa niyam he yahi vajah he ki vahaan krime rate bahut hi kam he
 Why did you learn martial arts? To tell the truth, i had learned martial arts because of a girl because i had a friend who used to learn karate, he keeps impressing that girl the whole time and i stayed behind, so then i Also started learning and then fell in love with martial arts more than a girl
 is film ke liye aapane kitni tranning lee he?maine lagbhag 4 maheene tak is film ke liye training lee he
 Of all the kicks and punches in this film, 60% are real

" maharashtra ke vidarbha main bjp-shivasena ko nuksanavidarbha main 25 fisadi dalit matadaata kingmekarcongress-ensipi or prakaash ambedkar ko labhbijepi-shivasena maharashtra kii siyaasi jang fatah kar satta main ek baar phir vaapasi karti najar aa rahi he, lekin vidarbha ilaake main devendra fadanvis kaa jaadu nahin chal sakaa he
 According to the India today-axis My India exit poll, bjp-shiv Sena alliance seats in Vidarbha region seem to be decreasing in the assembly elections
 jabaki congress-ensipi gathbandhan ke saath prakaash ambedkar kii vanchit bahujan aghadi or anya kii siten badhati dikh rahi hai
 It seems that bjp-shiv Sena has had to fall prey to the anger of Dalit voters in Vidarbha region
 india today-exis maai india agsit pole ke mutabik is baar ke chunaav main vidarbha ilaake kii kul 62 vidhansabha siton main se bijepi-shivasena ko 38 siten milti najar aa rahi hai
 Whereas, in 2014 BJP won 44 seats and Shiv Sena won 4 seats
 is tarah se donon partiyon ne milakar 48 siten jiti thim
 If the exit poll turns into a result, then both may have to lose about 10 seats
 haalanki, mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis or kendriya mantri nitin gadakari isi vidarbha ke ilaake kii nagpur se chunakar aate hai
 On the other hand, according to the exit poll, the congress-ncp alliance is expected to get 16 seats in Vidarbhailake
 jabaki vanchit bahujan aghadi sahit anya ke khate main 8 siten jaati hui najar aa rahi hai
 While in Vidarbha region, Congress got 10 seats, NCP 1 and others 4 seats in the 2014 assembly elections
 is tarah se congress-ensipi ke khate main 5 se 6 or anya ke liye 4 siton kii badhotaree hoti najar aa rahi he
 Dalit voters in Vidarbha Kingmaker: In Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, around 25 per cent are Dalit voters
 kuch vidhansabha siten aisi hai, jahaan par 35 fisadi se bhi zyada dalit voter he
 After the Dalit leader Ramdas Athawale left with the Republican Party of India BJP, the newly formed Dalit society, which had kept away from the right wing ideology, was feeling helpless
 bhima-koregaanv se prakaash ambedkar ne pakad banaaido saal pehle huibhima-koregaanv kii ghatana ke baad jab is varg ke daliton kii kaman prakaash ambedkarne thami, to is varg ko netritv mil gaya
 Prakash Ambedkar, who has been facing political exile for years, has since turned twelve
 isi kaa nateeja he ki loksabhaa chunaav main prakaash ambedkar ne asaduddin ovaisi ke saath milakar dalit-muslim gathjod banaaya
 With 14 per cent votes in the Lok Sabha, this alliance had caused considerable damage to the congress-ncp in 12 Lok Sabha seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 ovaisi-ambedkar ne 14 fisadi vot hasil karke congress-ensipi ko baari nuksaan kiya tha
 The Dalit community has increasingly become inclined towards Prakash Ambedkar in Maharashtra
 iskaa asar is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main dekhne ko mila he
 Prakash Ambedkar's party also seems to be benefiting from this
 vidarbha ilaake main anya ko jo 8 siten mili hai, isamen ambedkar kii party ke hisse main kai siten aa sakati hai
 Prakash Ambedkar's underprivileged Bahujan Aghadi fielded candidates in 274 assembly seats in Maharashtra

 There are five stories of Salman Khan becoming wealthy and these things have been told by Salman Khan himself
 baarah ghanton main salmaan chaandi ke ho gayi or unka dil sone kaa ho gaya
 The story of Salman becoming rich, number one Vansalman had picked up sacks of grains in the morning, and by the end of the evening Salman was weighed with silver ingots
 kitna vajan uthaaya hoga salmaan ne
 Some thirty forty kilos here
 tees chalis kilo anaaj kii keemat hogi chaar-paanch sau rupee
 But what was the cost of this wage in Change? Salman was weighed with silver equal to his weight
 kareeb nabbe kilo chaandi jab taraazoo par chadhaaya gaya tab jaakar kanta baraabar hua
 It is good that Ramadan is the month, otherwise more silver would be required to match Salman's weight
 salmaan ke vajan kii is chaandi ko dubai ke ek kaarobaari ne kharid liya
 Think recently, one of Salman's Towels 1
 50 lakh main nilaam hua tha to salmaan ke naam kii is chaandi ne kaise daulat batori hogi
 Salman is delighted that this wealth will go directly to the needy through his organization Being Human
 lekin inhen baarah ghanto ke dauraan salmaan khan kaa dil sone kaa kaise ho gaya? salmaan ne to apana dil subah subah hi un bacchon par lutaa diya tha jo mumbai ke bal sudhaar grih main garibi or abhaav ke bich insaaniyat kaa paath pard rahe hai
 This is the miracle of robbing the heart
 salmaan ke paas jo dil tha wo insaaniyat kii bhalaai se judaa to sone kaa ho gaya
 For the sake of humanity, Salman has only paid wages
 salmaan ne zarurat mandon ke liye abhi abhi to sirf dil kaa darwaja kholaa he or salmaan sone chaandi ke ho gayi
 i do not know what will happen when Salman will plunder his body, mind and wealth
 salmaan ke daulat mand banane kii kahani number doye wo kahani he jisamen salmaan ke daulatmand banane or dilipakumaar ke diwaala nikalne kii dastaan he
 This is in those days when Salman Khan was going to audition for his film Maine Pyar Kiya
 yahi se shuru hoti he salmaan khan ke daulatmand banane kii kahani
 While leaving for the first audition, Salman Khan met Dilip Kumar Saheb
 dilip kumaar ne salmaan khan ko ek purse or ek rupee kaa sikaa diya or kaha jaao daulat kamao
 Just after that Daulat's rate was at Salman's rate
 uphaar me diya dilip kumaar kaa wo purse vaaki jaadui tha
 Salman did not separate him from him even for a moment but after years when that purse was torn, Salman again went to Dilip saheb, Dilip Kumar raised his hand and where do i need some wealth to live? 
 salmaan ke daulatmand banane kii kahani number teendileep kumaar ne salmaan khan ko jo lucky sikaa diya tha
 Salman gave him pity to a beggar
 bhikhaari ko sikaa dete vakt salmaan kaa dil dekhie
 Salman's thinking was that the coin that changed his fortune, he might even reverse the fate of this beggar
 lagata he bhagwaan salmaan ke dil kaa imtihaan le rahaa tha
 Salman's films were being beaten at that time, the beggar returned the coin to Salman saying that you need this coin more than me at this time
 ye salmaan kii dariyaadilii nahin to or kya he apni sabase pyaari cheez ko lutaaney par bhi wo amada rahe
 Salman has a wealth of heart, perhaps that's why there is no shortage of luck in making him rich
 salmaan ke daulatmand banane kii kahani number charasalamaan khan ko jab chaandi kii silliyon se tola ja rahaa tha salmaan khan, jab zaruuratmandon kii bhalaai se judi apni sanstha beeing human kii kamai ke liye sone ke sikke jari kar rahe the to unke donon bhai or donon bahanen unke saath thi
 This family is the strength of Salman
 parivaar se pyaar karnaa salmaan ko apane mata pita se viraasat main mila lekin salmaan ko apane pita saleem se viraasat main jo bada dil mila usne unhen bana diya bada dil vaala daulatmand
 Salman's story of becoming rich is number five, the story of the day when Salman was a very young child
 wo diwaali kaa din tha
 When the whole world was giving up firecrackers, Salman Khan was taking money out of his father's purse and burning it
 salmaan kii ye paanch kahaniyaan kaaphi he ye samajhane ke liye kyon he salmaan ke paas itani daulat
 If these five stories of Salman are true, then believe me, this wealth is still very low in front of Salman's heart

 Pakistan is shocked by this decision
 usee ke kehane par ab uske dost china ne sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad (UNSC) ke saamne is masale ko uthaaya he
 Close door meeting is also being done on this, but Pakistan should remember that UNSC had a similar meeting on Kashmir issue in 1971, but nothing could happen

 Aam Aadmi Party's rebel MLA Kapil Mishra has challenged in the Delhi High Court against the Speaker's decision to cancel membership from the Delhi Assembly
 jis par court main kapil mishra kii taraf se kaha gaya he ki dilli vidhansabha adhyaksh mahoday ne 'lau of natural justise' ke khilaaf jaakar nirnay sunaaya
 The Speaker abused his constitutional powers by hearing an unconstitutional petition
 vahiin, kapil mishra ne kaha ki vidhansabha adhyaksh ne supreme court ke faislon or guidelins kaa ulanghan kiya or vidhansabha adhyaksh ne sunwaayee ke mauka nahin diya
 Even the cross examination and the witness were not given a chance to present the facts
 mishra ke vakil ne kaha ki 27 janvari ko jis taarikh se vidhansabha adhyaksh ne sadsyta radd karne kaa nirnay diya, uske baad dilli vidhansabha kaa bajet satr bhi hua tha jisamen kapil mishra ne vidhansabha kii kaarywahi main hissaa bhi liya
 The House showed no intention of toppling the government and violating the whip
 isliye vidhansabha adhyaksh ke faisle ko nirast kar diya jaae
 Opposing the Speaker's counsel Sudhir Nandan said that Kapil Mishra's allegations are false
 hamane notice diya tha or saath hi kai maukey die, lekin unhone riplai file nahin kiya
 We also put up many applications and demanded cross-examination of the complainant (sourav Bhardwaj)
 spikar ko 1 july ko shikaayat mili thi
 On July 10, we sent a notice
 17 july ko mishra ne aplication lagaai uske baad mishra ko 23 july ko cross ejamination ke liye bulaayaa gaya par koi nahin aayaa
 After this, the opportunity was again given on 26 July

 This affidavit will have to be filed in two weeks

 ) rio olympic main bharat ko padak kii ummid teerandaajon se bhi he
 Especially from Deepika Kumari
 bhale hi olympic main abtak indian archars khaali haath hi rahe hon
 But the skill and ability of Indian archers always gives the country a place to medal
 rio olympic main kuch ummiden aisi hi hai
 It is believed that Indian archers will win medals in Rio
 mahila teerandaajon se he padak kii ummid2012 landan olympic main bhartiya purush teerandaji team ne pre quarter final tak kaa safar tay kiya tha
 But India's men's team could not qualify for Rio
 purushon kii vyaktigat spardhaa main atanu das ekmaatr bhartiya teerandaaj hai
 In such a situation, the responsibility of the country to get the first Olympic medal of archery team event is on the women's team of Deepika Kumari, Laishram Bombayla Devi and Lakshmi Rani Majhi
 rio olympic main bhartiya mahilatirandajonki team saat agast ko apane abhiyaan kaa aagaaj karegi
 There will be archery events for eight days
 During the Olympics, there will be eight days of archery events and 128 archers from 56 countries will participate in these events
 olympic main hissaa le rahe sabhi bhartiya teerandaajon kii ranking acchhee he, or ve behtareen form main bhi hai
 However, history shows that the Indian team is unable to keep its pulse in important matches against strong teams
 jiske chalate taff fite dene ke baavjood bhartiya teerandaazon ko haar jhelni padi he
 In such a situation, if the Indian archers in Rio end their weakness of losing patience, then the medal will be ours
 bhartiya teerandaajon kii chunautirio olympic main bhartiya teerandaajon ke liye kritrim roshni main khelnaa ek badi chunauti hogi
 It is not a practice to play Indian archers in artificial light
 aise main isnai paristhitimein agar wo khud ko dhaal pate hai
 So the medal can be theirs
 deepika or bombyla devi landan olympic kaa hissaa rah chuki hai
 But Majhi and Atanu are participating in the Olympics for the first time
 bharat ko sabase zyaada ummiden bhartiya mahila team se he
 Which is headed by former world number one Deepika
 deepika ne is baar olympic ke liye mushkil taiyaari kii he
 And his performance in the qualifying match has been excellent
 kwalifyres ke dauraan deepika ne do baar world record ko todaa tha
 And this form of Deepika makes her the biggest gold medal contender in Rio
 alimination round saat agast se shuru hogamahila team kaa alimination round saat agast se shuru hoga
 While the Archery women's team's title match will be on August 8
 or aath agast ko hi mahila indiviual archari event keeliminationaround shuru honge
 The final match for the title of the Women's Individual Archery event will be held on August 12
 bhartiya teerandaajon kaa olympic main ab tak kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan 2004 or 2008 main rahaa he
 In both these Olympics, the women's team was successful in reaching the quarter-finals
 lekin vyaktigat spardhaa main ab tak koi bhi bhartiya teerandaaj quarter final tak nahin pahunch sakaa he
 This is the reason why the Archery Association of India sent the Indian contingent to Rio a month earlier
 taaki ve yahaan ke vaataavaran ke anukool khud ko acchhee tarah dhaal saken
 India has no Olympic medal in archery so far
 bhartiya teerandaaj 1988 ke baad se har baar olympic main hissaa lete rahe hai
 In such a situation, India will have to give its best in Rio to create history
 wo bhi puure dhairya ke saath

 This Sunday is very special for Kanwadi
 darasal isi din kaanvdie bhagwaan shiv kaa shraddhapurvak gangaajal se jalabhishek karte hai
 In most parts of the country, the Kanwar yatra continues throughout the year, but with the Jalabhishek in Delhi NCR, the Kanwar yatra ends
 dilli or ensiaar main jalabhishek kaa kaarykram bade dhoomdhaam se kiya jaataa he
 There is an echo of har-har Mahadev on every side in the month of Sawan
 bam-bam bhole ke naaron se aasmaan gunj rahaa he
 Though Kavad Yatra continues throughout the whole month of Sawan, but Shivaratri is considered to be the most special day to please Shiva, so the Kandar pilgrims do Jalabhishek on this day to pay their respects to Lord Shiva
 jalabhishek se ek din pehle hi shiv mandiron main bhakton kii baari bheed jute jaati he
 Along with Shivaratri, devotees start offering Jalabhisheka to Lord Shiva
 manyata he ki is din ravan ne apana ek sir bhagwaan bholenath ke charnon main arpit kar diya tha, isliye mana jaataa he ki isadin jalabhishek karne se shiv ji jaldi prasann ho jate hai
 Devotees of Bholenath are performing Jalabhishek in huge number in the Shiva temples of Delhi and NCR since night
 ye silsilaa din bhar chalegaa
 In the Dudheshwar temple of Ghaziabad, lakhs of devotees have done water for Lord Shiva with Ganga water
 udhar, kanvad yatriyon kaa ek dal skates par yatra karke gangaajal lekar noida pahunchaa
 The Kavadians team consisted of adults as well as young children while skating
 haridwar se gangaajal lekar greater noida gaye is dal ke bhakton kaa maananaa he ki bhakthi kisi bhi tarah kii ja sakati he
 This is also the last day of the Kanwar Yatra in Delhi
 shiv ke jalabhishek ke saath hi kanvad yatra khatm ho jaaegi, isliye kaanvdie jald se jald mandir pahunchnaa chaahate hai, taaki muhoort se pehle bholenath ko gangaajal kaa abhishek kar saken
 Although there is no crowd of office goers on the roads due to Sunday, but then avoid going on the roads with kanvadi or else you can get stuck in heavy jams

 Ravindra Jadeja is good at it and Virat Kohli also likes it

 He is always in trouble in his home state, but when he is playing with us, we would like to teach him a tough lesson
 jis tarah se mitch (janson) pradarshan kar rahaa he use dekhte hue yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki vah aag ugal rahaa he or aage isse behatar pradarshan karegaa
 However, on the form of Kohli, Harris was cautious in making a statement, who had done well in Australia four years ago
 england main haalanki vah paanch test maichon main 13
 Only scored an average of 40 which does not include a single half-century
 unhone kaha, ‘usne nishchit rup se tab se lekar ab tak kaaphi anubhav hasil kar liya he lekin hamaari koshish rahegi ki vah drive karata rahe
 Many balls are coming out with the edge of his bat
 haris ne kaha, ‘viraat apane pad par aane vaali gendon ko acchhee tarah se kheltaa he
 Therefore, the ball that is on the middle and leg stump is not going to be spared
 hamen yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki uske ham of stump se baahar kii line par gend karen
 He is a very good player but hopefully he will not be able to come back because we do not want him to score a century against us

 mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi isi maddenjar kattar chhavi ke maane jane vaale yogi adityanath ke jariye kerala main chunavi abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kar rahi he
 In fact, the BJP is trying to feed lotus in West Bengal and Kerala , after taking over the power of the country

 However, the party is reliant on the cadres of the Social Army to tackle these challenges and is ready to erase the power of the AAP in Delhi as a virus
 magar badalte bharat ko samajhane ke liye siyasat ko bhi khud ko badalanaa hoga

 At least 25 Indian students enrolled in the Computer Science Program of Western Kentucky University in the US this year have been asked to enroll in other schools or return to India as they do not meet the university's admission standards
 yah khabar 'neuyark times' ne mangalvaar ko prakashit kii he, jabaki is vakt pradhanmantri narendra modi america main hi daure par hai
 With the help of international recruiters, the university had enrolled 60 students in the program in January this year
 western kentki uniwarsity ke computer scince program ke adhyaksh james gairi ne samachaarpatr ko bataaya ki 'lagbhag 40' chaatr unke pravesh maanakon par khare nahin utre the, jabaki uniwarsity kii ore se unhen madad bhi uplabdh karai gai thi
 According to the newspaper, out of a total of 60, about 35 students will remain enrolled, while 25 will have to go
 gairi ke anusaar, in chaatro ko program main banaae rakhana ek galati ke baad duusari galati karne jaisaa hoga, kyonki ve computer program tak nahin likh sakate, jo unke paathyakram kaa behad zaruri hissaa he, or america main snaatakon ko sikhaaya jaataa he
 Regarding the need for these students to be fired, Gary said, "if they are not able to write the program even after they leave, then it would be a shame for my department
 
 
 " The admission of these students was done through an entry campaign in India, under which recruiters also offered 'spot admission' and fee waiver in advertisements
 uniwarsity kii seenet ne ab ek prastaav kaa anumodan kar diya he, jisamen recruitment abhiyaan ko lekar chintaa jataai gai he, or iske alaava ek bayaan main kaha gaya he ki ab unhone bharat main jari recruitment prakriya main badlaav kar diya he
 From now on, members of the University's Computer Science Department will also go to India, so that they can meet the students before admission is approved
 tippaniyan On the other hand, Aditya Sharma, president of the Indian Student Association at the university has expressed concern about these students
 public health administration ke chaatr aditya ne kaha, "mujhe in chaatro ke liye bahut bura lag rahaa he
 
 
 They reached here, and they also invested a lot of money
 
 
 " But Aditya admitted that some students adopted a 'wavering' attitude towards their studies
 aditya ke anusaar, "ve chaatr grad point everej bhi hasil nahin kar paae, isliye uniwarsity ko yah fasala karnaa padaa
 
 
 " uniwarsity ne isi saal janvari main antarrashtriya recruitaron kii madad se 60 chaatro ko program main daakhila diya tha
 James Gary, president of the Computer Science Program at Western Kentucky University, told the newspaper that 'about 40' students did not meet their entry standards, while the university also provided them with help
 akhbaar ke mutabik, kul 60 main se lagbhag 35 chaatro kaa daakhila barkaraar rahegaa, jabaki 25 ko har haal main janaa hi hoga
 According to Gary, retaining these students in the program would be like making one mistake after another, because they cannot write even computer programs, which are a very important part of their curriculum, and are taught to graduates in the US
 in chaatro ko nikaale jane kii zarurat ke bare main gairi ne kaha, "agar ve yahaan se nikalne ke baad bhi program likhane ke kaabil nahin hue, to yah mere vibhaag ke liye sharmindagi kaa bis banegaa
 
 
 " in chaatro kaa daakhila bharat main ek pravesh abhiyaan chalaakar kiya gaya tha, jiske tahat recruitaron ne vigyapanon main 'spot admician' tathaa fees main chhot kii peshkash bhi di thim
 The university's Senate has now approved a proposal, raising concerns about the recruitment campaign, and in a statement said that they have now changed the recruitment process in India
 ab se uniwarsity ke computer scince vibhaag ke sadsy bhi bharat jaaenge, taaki pravesh ko manjuuri die jane se pehle ve chaatro se mil saken
 The comments udhar, uniwarsity main indian student association ke adhyaksh aditya sharma ne in chaatro ko lekar chintaa vyakt kii he
 Aditya, a student of Public Health Administration said, “I feel very bad for these students
 
 
 ve yahaan tak pahunche, or unhone kaaphi paisa bhi lagaaya

 Bollywood's successful director Kabir Khan has made five films so far, of which three have Katrina Kaif heroine
 kya vajah he ki kabir or katrina donon hi ek-duusare ke pasandida hai? Katrina Kaif also stars in Kabir Khan's upcoming film Phantom
 is film ke pramotional event par katrina ne bataaya kii kyon hai, kabir khan unke pasandida
 Katrina said that Kabir is a director who gives me complete freedom to speak
 main kuch bhi bolti rahati hum or vah chupchaap meri baton ko sunate rahete hai
 He is a good and noble person, so i enjoy working with him and he makes good films
 kabir kii pehali film 'kabul express' main katrina nahin thim, kyonki is film main heroin kii koi bhoomika bhi nahin thi
 The second film 'new York' featured Katrina Heroine opposite John Abraham
 yah film box offis par bhi safal hui thi or katrina ke abhinay kii shaayad pehali baar thodi taareef hui thi
 The comments kabir kii teesri film 'ek tha tiger' main salmaan ke saath katrina thim or is film kii safalataa sabko yaad hi he
 Kareena replaced Katrina in the fourth film 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' but Katrina came back again in the fifth film 'phantom'
 is film main katrina ne khub ection kiya he or inkaa kirdaar bhi damdaar he
 That is, out of the five films of Kabir, the heroine of three films has been Katrina Kaif
 vajah jo bhi ho par katrina or kabir kii chemistry hit he
 Katrina Kaif also stars in Kabir Khan's upcoming film Phantom

 vajah jo bhi ho par katrina or kabir kii chemistry hit he
 Katrina was not there in Kabir's first film 'kabul Express', because the heroine did not play any role in this film
 duusari film 'neuyork' main jon abraham ke saath katrina heroin thim
 The film was also successful at the box office and Katrina's performance was perhaps praised for the first time
 tippaniyan Katrina was opposite Salman in Kabir's third film 'ek Tha Tiger' and everyone remembers the success of this film
 chauthi film 'bajrangi bhaijan' main katrina kii jagah karina ne lee magar paanchavin film 'phantum' main phir katrina waapas aa gayi
 In this film, Katrina has done a lot of action and her character is also strong
 yani kabir kii paanch filmon main se teen filmon kii heroin katrina caff rahi hai
 Whatever the reason, Katrina and Kabir's chemistry is a hit
 kabir kii teesri film 'ek tha tiger' main salmaan ke saath katrina thim or is film kii safalataa sabko yaad hi he
 Kareena replaced Katrina in the fourth film 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' but Katrina came back again in the fifth film 'phantom'

 gajiabad ke indirapuram sthit gym kor enrgiger kaa yah drishy yuvaonmen deh banane ke badhate craij kaa udhaaharan he
 Umaesh, who owns the gym and has been Mr
 India, says, "when i started the gym in 2008, there were about 80 to 100 people, many of whom were not very serious
 uskaa ek bada kaaran yah bhi tha ki kariyar or rojgaar ke koikhas avasar najar nahin aate the
 But after 2014, there have been major changes in the gym industry
 gym main aane waalon kii sankhyateji se badi he,saath hi ve ek taylakshya ke saath aane lage hai
 a major reason for this trend is the increased employment opportunities in the fields of bodybuilding, weight lifting, modeling and training
 saath hi film dekhakar body yaa jiro figure banane ke shauk ne bhiyuvaon ko gym kii ore modaa he
 On the strength of this craze, the size of the fitness industry was Rs 21,000 crore
 ke baraabar ho gaya or yah har saal16se18fisadi kii dar se bad rahaa he
 The number of people in the gyms of the cities is also increasing rapidly, whose lifestyle has become stagnant due to working in office hours and the doctor has advised them for a workout
 jaahir he,feet rahane ke lieunhone gym kaa rukh kiya he
 The growing market of fitness is mainly three major segments of the market of fitness
 pehla gym main lagane vaali mashine,doosraa food supplement or teesraa isse jude saamaan(accessories) kaa
 Anant Ratnakar Gawande, director of Talwalkars Lifestyle, a country giant in the Fitnet sector, says, “the fitness market in India is growing at a pace of 16 to 18 per cent every year
 fitnesake saath welnes ko jod dene par is bazaar kaa aakaar95,000karod ru
 Becomes of ''twachaa,saundarya or balonse judi chizon kaa bazaar welnes ke antargat aata he,jabaki bodybuilding,yoga,jumaka,pilats jaisi shaareerik gatividhiyon ke liye jaruriutpaadon kaa bazaar fitness industry ke tahat rakhaa jaataa he
 The talk has increased the culture of machines for exercising with the increasing awareness of machines and changing trends in such a way that along with gym they are now taking place in homes too
 bench,rod or dambles vaale gym bhi dhire-dhire khud ko multigim keemdad se badalane lage hai
 90% of gym equipment in the country are imported
 ye equipment mukhyatah china,taiwan,america,korea or spain se aate hai
 Many Indian companies are importing machines with their own branding in association with Chinese manufacturing companies
 america or europe kii badi companiyon main cybax,tru fitness,lesco,nortles,life fitness,star trek,free moshan aadi shaamil hai
 These can be mainly divided into three parts to understand the equipment market
 pehla cardio,doosraa strength or teesraa free wet
 Free weight and dumbbells come from China and Taiwan
 vahiin,cardio orstrength kii mashiinon main america or europea deshon kaa dabadabaa he
 Pankaj Lalwani, the North India head of Acme Fitness, the giant that imports gym equipment in the country, says, "machines coming from China and Taiwan are cheaper
 lekin quality or fitures ke maamle main ye america oreuropea deshon se aane vaali mashiinon ke mukaable nahin hoti
 For example, there is a big difference in cushioning and foaming quality of a treadmill
 protein he ahmafitness se judekisi bhi abhyaas main trainer ke maargdarshan ke saath-saath sahi diet bahut ahm hoti he
 At the same time, the role of supplements is important in the field of bodybuilding
 har vyaktike sharir kii jarurat ke hisaab se use supplement die jate hai
 Many Indian and foreign companies in the country are selling their products in the supplement market
 da nutrishanplanet ke founder rahul gupta kehete hai,"bhartiya companiyonmen masal braij,big masal,health form jaisi companiyon ke protein productadmand main hai,vahiin optimmanutrishan,jiensi,beasen,nechar best,kuanti jaisivideshi companiyon ke product trainurs istemaal karne kii salaah dete hai
 Protein Products of Indian Companies Rs 1,200
 prati kilose shuru hokar7,000ru
 They come per kilogram
 videshi companiyon ke product kii range1,500ru
 10,000 to Rs
 prati kilo tak he
 "manish Gupta, director of the same company, says," Apart from protein, various types of supplements like amino, fish oil, multivitamins etc
 are used for the body
 ''masalan,vajan ghataane ke liye fat burner capsule lene kisalaah di jaati he to vajan badhaane ke liye wet giner kii
 Things like fish oil, amino are used by people doing heavy workouts
 majboot sambhaavnaayenfitaness kshetraki sangathit companiyon main talavalkars,fitness first,gold gym jaise gine-chune naam hai,jinaki pahunch abhi bade shaharon or metro tak hisimit he
 But the passion to create a body in small cities has created unorganized people in the local mohallas
 yahi kaaran he ki desh main fitness ke bazaar kaa bada hissaa abhi bhiasangathit he
 According to the annual report by Talwalkars Lifestyle, as of 2017, the number of fitness clubs in the US was 38,477, while in India, the number of clubs is 3,800 even after three times the population
 20karod kii aabaadi vaale brazil main kul34,509club hai
 This number of clubs is public gym only
 hotel,socity main honevaale gym ko isamen shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 Obviously, the country still has a lot of potential in this area
 bharat mengim or welnes centre ko niyantrit karne ke liye koi kanoon bhi nahin he
 In the last two years, a private member bill has been introduced twice
 132karod se zyaadaki aabaadi vaala bharat27varsh ausat aayu kesath duniya kaa sabase jawan desh he
 Ranjanghosha, Senior Regional Manager (north), Gold Gym, says: "people's awareness of fitness in India is slowly increasing
 aise main1fisadi log bhi agar gym kaa rukh karte hai to sochie,ham kitne bade bazaar ko aakarshith karte hai
 "obviously, this young country — where a large part of the growing fitness market is still unorganized — has immense potential in this field
 ththdesi gym -videshi mashinechin or taiwan seyt hone vaali mashine sasti hoti hai
 At the same time, machines coming from America, European country, Korea are expensive
 pankaj lalwani kehete hai,mahangi hone ke peeche mukhya vajah inamen qualityor fitures kaa antar hota he
 For example, if the normal trade mill increases the features like wi-fi connectivity, facility to install pan drive for music, display monitor, then its price also increases
 vahiin duusari ore sasti mashiinon main teen treadmilako ek hi monitor se atech kar diya jaataa he
 Apart from the features, if you talk about the quality then there is a big difference in the cushioning and foaming of the treadmill
 quality kii vajah semshinon par kasarat karte samay movement main antar aata he
 Movement has a very important role
 lalwani yah bhi kehete hai ki galat mashin par yaa galat tarah se kisi abhyaas ko lambey samaytak kar liya jaae to yah kai tarah kii bimariyon kaa kaaran ban jaataa he
 Devices such as multijim are used due to less space

 shuukravaar ko muslim paksh kii taraf se senior edwocket rajeev dhawan ne apni daleelein shuru kin
 During this, Justice Bobde asked whether divinity is imposed on anything in Islam? On this, the Muslim side said that this happens in both religions, mosque is an example in Islam
 justise bobade ne kaha ki ham hameshaa sunate hai ki aisa kuch nahin he, aap allaah kii puja karte hai naa ki kisi vastu kii
 We want to see if any institution has considered the mosque to be revered, because only when it comes to worshiping Allah
 is dauraan senior edwocket rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki hindu pakshakaar babar par mandir todakar masjid banane kaa iljaam lagaate hai, lekin babar koi vidhvansak nahin tha
 The mosque was built by Mir Baqi at the behest of a Sufi
 is dauraan unhone padhaa ki ‘he ram ke vajood par hindustaan ko naaz ahale nazar samajhate hai usko imam e hind
 At the same time, during the hearing of the case, Justice Chandrachud asked whether there was any evidence that Babar had given any help to Babri Masjid
 On this Rajiv Dhawan denied any evidence
 saath hi kaha ki saboot mandir ke daavedaaron ke paas bhi nahin he
 Muslims received compensation after the attack on the mosque: Rajiv Dhawan, Senior Advocate Rajiv Dhawan said that a Nihang came there in 1855 and he worshiped and marked Guru Govind Singh there
 haalanki baad main sari chijen hataa di gai thim
 The British Governor General and Faizabad Deputy Commissioner had also given rent free villages and then revenue villages for maintenance of the mosque as per Babar's decree
 aarthik sahaayta ke chalate hi duusare paksh kaa edwars pajishan nahin ho sakaa
 Rajiv Dhawan said that after the attack on the mosque in the year 1934, compensation was also given to the Muslims to make up for the loss

 Also said that you were given four and a half days
 ab aapako jawaab dena he, to ab aap ise 20-20 kah rahe hai? to kya aapaki pichhali bahes test match thi? Former India cricket captain Kapil Dev, who won the World Cup in 1983, believes that the strong side of the Indian team will be his batting in the upcoming World Cup, but if India has to win the title this time in this cricket league after 28 years, then toss
 At the time, Mahendra Singh Dhoni will also need luck
 kapil ne saakshaatkaar main kaha, ‘‘ballebaaji hamaari majbootee he or meraa maananaa he ki hamen is par nirbhar hokar vishwaas rakhana chahie
 Sometimes luck also plays an important role
 har match main toss jeetna kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 If we lose the toss and the opposition team gives us a huge target of 300 or more runs, then it will be very difficult
 ’’unhone kaha, ‘‘agar ham pehle ballebaaji karte hai or 300 yaa isse adhik ran banaate hai, to hamaare gendbaaj har match jeetne ke liye bachaa hua kaam puraa kar sakate hai
 "most people have expressed concern over the lack of an all-rounder with the World Cup Indian team balanced, but Kapil said that Dhoni will fill that space properly as a wicket-keeper batsman
" unhone kaha, ‘‘aisi koi baat nahin he kyonki wicketiper ko bhi olerounder mana jaataa he
 We have Dhoni as an all-rounder in the team
 aashaa he ki vah itihaas rachane or bharat ko vishwacap dilaane main madad karne ke liye acha pradarshan karenge
 However, the figures are witness to the fact that no host has won the World Cup so far
 ’’upmahadweep main 19 farvari se shuru ho rahe vishwacap main bharat kii sambhaavnaaon ke bare main kapil ne kaha, ‘‘kaagaj par bharat bina kisi shaq ke prabal daavedaaron main shaamil he
 There are many match-winning players in our team, but fielding and the race between the wickets is suspect, as there are some weak links in the team
 kul milakar team kii ballebaaji kaaphi majboot he, jo aapako behatar sthiti main pahunchaa sakati he
 Kapil said that Dhoni's exceptional leadership is the strength of the team
 unhone kaha, ‘‘team main captain mahatvapurn vyakti hota he or yah hamaare liye khushi kii baat he
 If he leaves, there is no one to take his place
 ’’ team main teen spinneron ke chune jane kii kaaphi aalochana kii ja chuki he lekin kapil is baat se ittefaq nahin rakhte
 "with some part-time bowlers, there is just one extra spinner in the team and the choice of final XI depends on the captain's perspective
" ’’ puche jane par ki kya gharelu maidan par khilne kaa dabaav team ke liye pareshaani paidaa kar saktaa he to kapil ne kaha, ‘‘main kahana chahta hum ki yah donon tareeke se kaam karata he
 People's expectations are very high and sometimes the expectations are very high
 phydemand yah he ki darshakon kaa samarthan aapako madad karne ja rahaa he
 Well that depends on how the team players take it
 ’’kapil ne is baat par koi tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya ki dakshin africa nivartmaan coach gairi karston ke vishwa cap ke baad chale jane se team ko unki kami mahasoos hogi
 He said, "I don't know because I'm not with the team and i can't answer what impact the coach had on the team's performance
" team ke saath pichley nau yaa das saal se koi na koi videshi coach lagaataar bane rahe hai
 "kapil said," i do not bother with these things because it is entirely the work of the Indian Cricket Board
 ’’ puche jane par ki vah bharat ko vishwa cap jeetne ke liye kya salaah dena chaahate hai to kapil ne kaha, ‘‘main khud ko salaah dene ke kaabil nahin maanata, lekin unhen apane khel kaa lutf uthaanaa chahie or kadi cricket khelni chahie
 Recalling his 1983 World Cup title, Kapil said that nobody expected to win the cup but confidence grew with each match
 unhone kaha, ‘‘kisi ko koi ummid nahin thi kyonki team or team prabandh ke kisi bhi sadsy ne hamaari jeet ke bare main nahin sochaa tha
 We never thought of this while leaving the World Cup
 ’’kapil ne kaha, ‘‘hamane apane liye koi lakshya nahin banaaya, lekin hamane har lig match jeetne par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 We wanted to win all our league matches first and then all the knockout matches
 jab ham final main pahunche to sabhi bahut khushi manaa rahe the or us samay hamane apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karne kii thaanee
 With the united efforts of the team we were able to win the title
 ’’ Congress leader Sandeep Dixit said on Wednesday that the Election Commission is a toothless body
 unhone kaha ki ayog shikayaton par koi karrwai nahin kar paata
 Congress candidate from East Delhi, Dixit said, 'the Election Commission issues only two-three toothless warnings and cannot do much more than that
 ' congress ne mangalvaar ko chunaav ayog main ramdev or art of leaving ke sansthaapak shri shri ravishankar ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karai or kaha ki ye log raajnneetik gatividhi kar rahe hai
 He has asked the Election Commission to monitor the publicity related issues of both the people
 congress netaa ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki unhone esemes dekhe hai jisamen shri shri ravishankar ne logon se purvi dilli main buudhvaar kii raat yojit hone vaale apane aadhyatmik kaarykram main shaamil hone kaa aagrah kiya he
 It will also seek 'support for BJP candidate Mahesh Giri'
 dikshit ne giri par aadhyatmik kaarykram ko prachaar ke hatkande ke rup main istemaal karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Votes will be cast in Delhi on 10 April
 vakt ke saath paramparaayen badalati hai
 There is nothing bad in this, but the matter comes when the age old tradition has to be changed in compulsion
 uttar pradesh ke mainpuri jile main kuch aisa hi ho rahaa he
 The wells are drying up due to falling ground water level
 sainkadon kuen khatm bhi ho chuke hai
 In such a situation, people got married in compulsion which used to be performed at the well before the ritual, now they are forced to celebrate at the hand pump
 majaburi aisi kii paramparaayen ko nibhaane kaa tarika bhi badal gaya
 Today, the rituals without which marriages would not have taken place earlier are seen as a compulsion of compulsion
 majaburi he sookhe kii, majaburi he pani kii killat kii
 The custom in Mainpuri is that the groom's mother hangs her feet in the well before leaving the wedding procession
 ye jataane ke liye ki use bahu kii jarurat he
 According to the rituals, at the well itself, the mother vows to the son that the son will bring a daughter-in-law for him
 ye parampara lambey samay se chali aa rahi he, maa kii is rasaadaaygi ke bina is ilaake main baraat vidaa nahin hoti thi
 Even after stepping into the daughter-in-law's house, the well was first worshiped
 shaadi kar ghar aayaa betaa apni patni ke saath kuen ke chakkar laga kar rasm puure karata tha
 Now the situation is that the wells have dried up in this area, the wells which were once filled with water, today there is not a drop of water in them
 hajaaron kuen to kab ke dhank kar band ho chuke hai
 He has now been replaced by handpumps
 kuen khatm ho gaye, lekin rivaaj khatm nahin hote, or wo bhi shaadi byaah jaise maukon par har rasm shiddat se nibhaai jaati he
 In such a situation, there was a shortage of wells, so the mode of ritual payment changed
 shaadi ke rasmon main ab kuen kii jagah pani kii tank or handpump ne le lee
 In many homes, work is done by keeping only a small drum
 rivaajon kii mushkil to jindagi main ek baar hi jhelni hoti he
 Married as soon as the rituals were performed, all the worries were over, but what about the difficulties that they will have to face and that is the problem of water shortage
 kuon ke sookhne kaa sidhaa matlab he ki is ilaake main dharti ke bheetar jalastr kii teji se kami ho rahi he or yahi sankat he is puure ilaake kii
 Once there were thirty thousand wells in this area, as the population increased, their number decreased and now few wells are left
 chintaa sirf ye nahin he ki ilaake main pani kaa sankat bad rahaa he, balki phikr is baat kii he ki is mushkil se nipatane kii koshish bhi nahin ho rahi he
 The government is considering the completion of its work by declaring two blocks of this area as dark zone
 paas se ek nadi bhi bahati he, lekin uskaa pani itnaa ganda he ki istemaal main nahin laayaa ja saktaa
 Under the MNREGA, the pond is excavated, some ponds are only on paper and the ones that are excavated are dry
 shaayad sarkaar bhi intjaar kar rahi he ki kab ye mushkil logon kii aadat ban jaae

 arvind media ke saath-saath dilli ke uparajyapal ke saath bhi jang main ulajh pade hai
 Overall, Kejriwal has opened a front on many levels simultaneously
 yahaan par ab yah sawaal uthta he ki arvind ke virdohi jo un par taanashaah hone kaa aarope lagaate hai, kya usamen dam he
 Strange that Arvind does not stop here, he wants a public trial of the media
 yadi aisa he to dilli ko mukhyamantri kii jarurat kya he, chuni hui sarkaar kii aavashyaktaa kya he, dilli main itane prachand bahumat aane ke baad bhi aam aadmi party kaa vyavhaar samaj se pare he, kya virodh kii raajnneeti karnaa unki fitrat he
 It was the Aam Aadmi Party that initially assured to give a new direction to Indian politics
 tippaniyan Just as a ray of hope was seen during the Janata Party and again during VP Singh, but both experiments failed
 ab baat aam aadmi party kii he, jamane ke pehle party main vikharaav kii prakriya shuru ho gai he to kya aam aadmi kaa bhi vahi hshr hoga, yaa yah kahen ki aam aadmi party ko abhi raajnneeti seekhni padegi, kyonki ek vakt main keval aarope lagaakar istipha maangane vaali aam aadmi party apane hi dilli ke mantri jitendra tomars kaa bachaav karne main juty he, kyonki party ko lagata he ki ek or jhatka abhi jhelana thik nahin he
 It is clear that the public wants their work done, Arvind Kejriwal announced compensation for farmers' wasted crops, but did not even survey the loss of farmers, that is, people's honeymoon with Kejriwal government is over and This is the real test of Kejriwal government
 yadi aisa he to dilli ko mukhyamantri kii jarurat kya he, chuni hui sarkaar kii aavashyaktaa kya he, dilli main itane prachand bahumat aane ke baad bhi aam aadmi party kaa vyavhaar samaj se pare he, kya virodh kii raajnneeti karnaa unki fitrat he
 It was the Aam Aadmi Party that initially assured to give a new direction to Indian politics
 tippaniyan Just as a ray of hope was seen during the Janata Party and again during VP Singh, but both experiments failed
 ab baat aam aadmi party kii he, jamane ke pehle party main vikharaav kii prakriya shuru ho gai he to kya aam aadmi kaa bhi vahi hshr hoga, yaa yah kahen ki aam aadmi party ko abhi raajnneeti seekhni padegi, kyonki ek vakt main keval aarope lagaakar istipha maangane vaali aam aadmi party apane hi dilli ke mantri jitendra tomars kaa bachaav karne main juty he, kyonki party ko lagata he ki ek or jhatka abhi jhelana thik nahin he
 It is clear that the public wants their work done, Arvind Kejriwal announced compensation for farmers' wasted crops, but did not even survey the loss of farmers, that is, people's honeymoon with Kejriwal government is over and This is the real test of Kejriwal government
 thik usee tarah jaise ek ummid kii kiran dikhi thi janata party ke samay or phir veepi singh ke vakt bhi, magar donon prayog vifal ho gaye

 When did the start of the Windows Smartphone, the first Windows smartphone was started in the year 2010 or 2010
 iske baad microsoft ne nokia brands ke smartphone banane kaa license liya
 Despite this, however, Windows Phone could not make a dent in the market

 For example, Google did not release many of its official apps for Windows Phone
 yahaan tak Windows ke kuch varjan se whatsap ne bhi apanassport khatm kar diya
 Not only this, Microsoft's professional social network Linked In app was removed from the Windows Store last month
 in vajahon ke alaava stretiji front par bhi kai aisi chook hui he
