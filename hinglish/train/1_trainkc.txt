 mehta ne bhi kaha ki peedit ko hawaii ambulance se singapore le jane kaa faisla isliye kiya gaya, kyonki vah aspataal ang pratiropan ke liye behtareen aspataalon main se ek he
 Another main reason was that the first objective was to save his life
 dow athani ne kaha, vah bahut bahadur ladki thi
 He said that the doctors at Safdarjung Hospital did not spare any effort to save him in view of his critical condition, but the nature of his injuries was such that he could not be saved

 Dr

 use bahut buree tarah jakhmi kiya gaya tha
 No part of his intestine was in good condition
 peedit ko singapore ke aspataal main kyon bheja gaya
 To this, Dr
 Mehta said, "the hospital there is one of the best hospitals in this part of the world and i have had many conversations with the doctors there
 maine vahaan kii suvidhaayen or upkaran khud dekhe hai
 Medical expert Dr Yatin Mehta of Medanta Medicity Hospital said that he was surprised by the criticism of the decision to send the victim to Singapore
 aalochanaon par pratikriya main dow mehta ne kaha, aksar doctor duusare doctoron ke faisle kii aalochana karte hai or yah sahi nahin he
 He said that the patient survived 48 hours in a hospital in Singapore and it cannot be said that he should not have been sent there
 dow mehta ne kaha, duusari baat yah he ki bharat main sarkari aspataalon or singapore ke mount elizbeth aspataal ke bich koi tulana nahin he
 i am not talking about the efficiency of doctors, but about basic facilities
 hamen yah pataa hona chahie
 Dr
 Athani stated that the victim had extremely serious injuries to the intestine and other organs
 unhone kaha, hamane uski aant kaa bahut bada hissaa sankraman kii vajah se nikaal diya tha
 The injuries were very serious

 maine vahaan kii suvidhaayen or upkaran khud dekhe hai
 Dr Mehta said, secondly, there is no comparison between government hospitals in India and Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore
 main doctoron kii kushalta ke bare main nahin, balki buniyadi suvidhaon ke bare main baat kar rahaa hum
 We should know this
 dow athani ne kaha ki peedit kii aant or anya angon main atyant gambhir chotein thim
 He said, we had removed a large part of his bowel due to infection
 jo chotein thim, vah atyant gambhir kism kii thim
 Athani said that the girl's condition was stable for the first five days after treatment and there were signs of improvement, but her condition worsened due to sepsis (blood transfusion)
 doctor ne kaha, uski ichhashakti prabal thi or usne police ko do bayaan die
 She was conscious
 athani ne kaha ki para-medical kii chaatra kaa safadarajang aspataal main or hawaii ambulance se singapore ke mount elizbeth medical centre le jane ke baad vahaan bhi behtareen ilaaj kiya gaya
 The hospital in Singapore is known for having multiple organ transplant facilities
 athani ne kaha ki bharat se abhinayta rajnikant or raajnneetijna amar singh jaisi jaani-maani hastiyaan vahaan ilaaj ke liye gayi or thik ho kar lauti hai
 Dr

 His condition was worse than in Delhi
 use bahut gambhir chotein ai thim or hamane use bachaane ke liye bharsak prayaas kiye
 Mehta also said that the decision was taken to take the victim from Hawaii ambulance to Singapore as the hospital is one of the best hospitals for organ transplantation
 ek or mukhya kaaran yah bhi tha ki uski jaan bachaana sabase pehla uddeshy tha
 Dr
 Athani said, she was a very brave girl
 unhone kaha ki safadarajang aspataal ke doctoron ne uski gambhir haalat ko dekhte hue use bachaane ke prayaason main koi kasar nahin chodi, lekin uski choton kii prakruti aisi thi ki use bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 Dr
 Athani said, even extremely serious patients with such injuries are admitted to the ICU and many of them survive
 yah ek atyant gambhir maamla tha
 The comments unhone kaha ki safadarajang aspataal ke doctoron, nurson or para-medical staff ne sachmuch kadaa parishram kiya
 It also got its reward and she was able to survive for at least 12 days after being brought here in a critically injured state on the night of 16 December

 # fuelchallenge punjab neshnal bank (PNB) dhokhadhadi maamle kaa aaropee mehul chokasee antigua main hi rah rahaa hai or usko vahaan kii naagarikta bhi mil chuki he
 The Government of Antigua has officially confirmed this for the first time
 antigua sarkaar ne apane yahaan mehul chokasee ke hone kii jaankaree interpol ko di
 After this, Interpol gave this information to India
 bataa den ki pichley saptaah sibiai ne neshnal krime beuro (enasibi) ke jariye antigua sarkaar ko khat likhaa tha ormehul chokseeki maujuudagi ke bare main jaankaree maangi thi, jiske baad interpol ne bharat ko yah jaankaree di
 The Antigua administration told India through Interpol that Mehul Choksi is in his country and has also become a citizen
 antigua sarkaar ne tab tak mehul chokasee ke apane desh main maujuud hone kii baat aadhikarik taur par nahin kahi, jab tak usase is sambandh main koi sampark nahin kiya gaya
 However, earlier Antigua officials told the local media that every legal appeal of the Indian government regarding the extradition of Mehul Choksi would be respected
 bhale is babat donon deshon ke bich koi dwipaksheeya sandhi nahin he
 According to senior officials, this official confirmation will help Indian agencies and government in the extradition of Mehul Choksi
 saath hi antarrashtriya manch par mehul chokasee ke pratyrpan ke mudde ko majbootee se uthaaya ja sakegaa
 At the same time, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has started the process of extradition of Mehul Choksi under the UN anti-corruption Convention (UNCAC)
 bharat ko yah rasta isliye apnaanaa pad rahaa he, kyonki antigua or bharat ke bich pratyrpan ko lekar kisi prakaar kaa koi samjhauta nahin he
 However, both countries are covered under the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC)
 sol main hue ji20 sammelan ke dauraan bharat ne UNCAC sandhi par sahmati jataate hue is par hastakshar kiye the or antigua ne bhi is par dastakhat kiye hai
 Under this, the countries signing the UNCAC will have to accept the UN treaty and implement it themselves

 Come and take me on a drive so i can get some fresh air
 mangetar shuruaati hichak ke baad gaadi hai ve par mode detaa he
 He stops at a gas station for fuel
 yahaan peeth sidhi karne ko veeraa baahar nikalati he or bas kuch hi second main dakait aa dhamakate hai or uskaa apharan kar le jate hai
 The film then rides on a snail's back and Veera on a truck
 sust raftaar main ek soobe se duusare soobe tak kaa tourism hota he
 The kidnappers, after clearing their hands, discover that they are fat
 veeraa ke pita bade udyogpati hai or munhmaangi rakam denge
 The question is not just about money
 dakaiton ke giroh kaa mukhiya mahabir (randeep hooda) amiron se nafrat karata he or kuch or bhi sabit karnaa chahta he
 Therefore, there is no effect on those warnings which are related to Veera's father's relations and consequences
 shuruaati mushkilon ke baad veeraa ke liye yah trip ‘india dait ij bharat’ ko samajhane kaa ek jariya banane lagati he
 Along the lines of Stockholm Syndrome (if you don't know it, get Google's help), he also starts to have sympathy with his kidnappers
 veeraa unase aise baat karti he, jaise play skool ke saathi hon
 What was so less
 ek daaku se kahati hai, english gaanon kii sidi lekar aao or phir mohatarama us par dance bhi karti hai
 Yes, the film Highway is abuzz with many such important scenes
 ek jagah trek ko police vaale rokte hai
 Veera can run away
 magar ye kya
 She hides so that the policemen do not see
 public kii to chhodie khud daaku mahabir ko veeraa kii ye harakat palle nahin padati
 Then the story reaches such a point that Mahabir wants to get the body released from Veera and Veera hide her head in the aspect
 ye sab kuch behad nakli najar aata he
 Not only this, there is also a side store 
 veeraa ke ek ankal hai, jo bachapan se is phool si bacchee kaa yon shoshan kar rahe hai
 But the difficulty is that this very creepy difficulty was not properly fitted in the frame of the film
 film main kuch acha bhi he kyaalia bhatta ne veeraa ke har shed ko bakhubi utaara he
 But the range of his character was kept very limited
 randeep hooda bhi aise kuch bure nahin hai
 Casting director Mukesh Chhabra has fielded brilliant and novel actors for other characters and has done a great job
 rahamaan kaa mujeec film kaa mood bakhubi set karata he
 Anil Mehta's cinematography is good
 magar in sabake baavjood film nahin jheli jaati
 Avoid this highway ye aapako kahin nahin le jayega

 Yahoo earlier used to have chat rooms where they interacted with each other based on their interests and topics
 haalanki ye usase thodaa alag he jarur he, lekin tarj vahi he
 According to reports, Facebook will get the Rooms feature through which unknown people can be interacted on any one topic
 philhal kuch deshon main isaki testing chal rahi he or bataaya ja rahaa he ki yah bulatin board style or real time miseging jaisaa hoga
 According to reports, it will first be released in Canada and Australia
 web ke alaava vahaan ke android yujar ko bhi yah feechar diya ja saktaa he
 According to an Australian website, the product manager of Facebook Messenger said, "in today's era, group chats are focused on people you know like friends and relatives
 hamane paaya he ki logon ko kisi khaas topic par log baatcheet karnaa chaahate hai
 This will be a conversion based on the topic and here people can also talk to those people who do not know on a particular topic
 ek khaas link generat hoga jise aap kisi ko bhi bhej sakate hai, iske jariye us room main jud jayega, chaahe wo aapaki frand list main ho yaa nahin
 As of now, neither the company has officially given information about its working nor has it been told about when it will be introduced worldwide
 fail hua tha fasebuk kaa Room apagauratlab he ki fasebuk ne pehle bhi Room naam kaa ek ap pesh kiya tha
 Through this, people could be talked to unknown people on the basis of interest and likes without making their full identity
 haalanki yah fail ho gaya or company fasebuk apane miseging ap massenger main hi ise aajmaana chaahati he
 But will the company succeed in this experiment like Yahoo or will it fail here like the Room app

 kabhi jurm kii duniya kaa betaj badshaah or mumbai main dehshat kaa doosraa naam rahaa daaud ibrahim 25 varshon se bharat se faraar he
 Meanwhile, intelligence of his being in Pakistan and UAE was also found, but the Indian government has not been able to get his extradition so far
 ab to yah bhi sawaal uthne lage hai ki kya jinda rahete don ko bharat laayaa ja sakegaa
 The same question dominated the sixth session of Agenda Aaj Tak
 daaud ke pratyrpan par agenda ajtak ke chathe satr main hissaa lene vaale CBI ke teen purv sheersh adhikariyon ne apni baaten rakhin
 What is there in Dawood's extradition? When Neeraj Kumar, former police commissioner of Delhi, was asked why it took so many years to bring Dawood to India and what was the problem, he said, "it has become difficult to catch Dawood Abraham because he is such a There are hidden in the country, terrorists from all over the world are hiding there and he continuously denies this
 isi kram main pakistan ne hameshaa daaud kii pakistan main maujuudagi ko kai mana nahin he
 Therefore, this work has become difficult due to bilateral relations
 lihaaja yah sirf daaud tak simit he
 Because in the last few decades the country's police has managed to catch many big don like Chhota Rajan
 iske alaava puure desh main kai jagah bade antkavaadiyon ko bhi pakadaney ke kaam main badi safalataa mil chuki he
 "how close to Dawood's Gireban? When asked by former CBI Director Anil Sinha whether India ever came close to capturing Dawood during this period, his reply was," As far as Don is concerned, we all know Chhota Rajan too
 Once we were Don, we brought him
 abu salem bhi don kehalaata tha, use bhi ham giraftaar karne main kaamyaab rahe
 Terrorists can also be caught, not just the don
 hamaari forces or intelligence agencys itani capasity or capability he ki ham kisi bhi apradhi ko duniya main kahin se bhi pakad sakate hai
 "why did it take so much time in Dawood's extradition," he said of the excessive time it takes to bring the criminals to the door of justice, "our country is not a mischievous country, nor is our mishia a mischievous mishia
" ham ek tay nyaay prakriya ke tahat chalane vaale desh hai
 So it takes time
 khaskar jab kisi duusare desh ne kisi apradhi yaa aatankwaadi ko panaah di ho to pareshaani bad jaati he
 This trouble is compounded when that country is always in denial
 "pakistan kaa sidhaa-sidhaa zikr karte hue anil sinha ne kaha ki aap kabhi bhi unase puch lijie ki aapane aatankwaadiyon ko panaah de rakhi he, ve kabhi nahin maanenge
 There are different laws of paper work, countries, the former Commissioner of Achaanmumbai, Apoorva Patnaik, was asked why Dawood could not be brought back till now, Mumbai's biggest enemy
 to unhone bataaya, "jis tarah ram se bada ram kaa naam hota he, usee tarah kabhi daaud se bada daaud kaa naam tha
 When i went to Mumbai in the 90s, there were areas like this - this area of gawli, this area of dawood
 us samay mumbai main bijness, film, raajnneeti kaa ek nexs bana hua tha
 There was no business to which Dawood's name was not attached
 lekin 92 main serial bam blast ke baad paristhitiyaan badalin
 It takes years to extradite a criminal due to paper work and different laws of the two countries
 "ham daaud ke khilaaf sargical strike karne main sakshainil sinha kehete hai, "sargical strike hamaari kshamta kaa udhaaharan tha
 We want to bring Dawood here, it is possible and it will be done
 vakt, halaat or jarurat ke hisaab se acshan liya jayega
 We will never tell in advance that we are going to do this
 "saath hi anil sinha kehete hai aaj hamaari sthiti majboot he

 Political parties take seriously the concerns of economists on statistics: Political parties: Mohanan, who recently resigned as the head of National Statistical Commission, Statistics with P

 Mohanan said on Thursday that political parties should take seriously the concern of 108 economists and sociologists over the alleged political interference in statistics data in the country
 mohanan ne kaha, 'haal ke ghatnakramon ke maddenjar in sabhi pramukh logon dwaara darj karaayi gai aapatti bahut hi samayik or praasangik he
 It is important that political parties take this seriously
 mohanan ne janvari main ayog ke kaaryvahak chairman pad se ek or sadsy ke saath istipha de diya tha
 The main reason for this is that the statistics of the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation regarding jobs were considered to be stopped
 dilli main ek press conference ke dauraan mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kaha he ki dilli sarkaar nursery admician main management cote ko puri tarah se khaarij karti he
 Regarding the management quota, Kejriwal said that this is a quota in which the most rigged and the government will not tolerate it and the schools which do not accept this rule will be canceled

 He said that despite all the efforts and strong decisions of the government, complaints are being received
 unhone privet skulon se kaha he ki EWS ke 25 fisadi cote ke alaava 75 fisadi siten arakshit nahin honi chahie
 Kejriwal said that schools have taken different criterias to reserve quotas
 kai skulon ne to yahaan tak criteria de diya he ki jinke mata-pita maansaahaari hai, sharaab yaa cigarette pite hai, unhen admician nahin milegaa
 a total of 62 such criterias will not be recognized by the Delhi government
 vahiin, federshan of public schools ke adhyaksh aar pi malik kaa kahana he ki management kota kaa maamla pichley ek saal se adaalat main he
 If the government gives any such order, we will go to court

 In such a situation, this big step of Kejriwal can raise many questions

 The campaign is going on loudly
 sabaki nigahen begusarai (begusarai) seat par hai, jahaan vampanthi dalon ke netaaon or film jagat kii mashhoor hasti javed akhtar (javed Akhtar) ne argedy ummidavaar tanwir hasan (tanvir Hasan) ko kanhaiya (kanhaiya Kumar) ke samarthan main baitaane kii apil kii thi
 But the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has rejected this demand
 rashtriya janata dal (RJD) ke rashtriya pravaktaa shivanand tiwari (shivanand Tivary) kaa kahana he ki javed akhtar (javed Akhtar) sahab mashhoor shaayar hai, vampanthi mizaaj ke hai
 We were together in the Rajya Sabha
 javed ji begusarai gaye the, media ke dulruva (dulaare) kanhaiya (kanhaiya Kumar) ke liye vot maangane
 This is their right
 lekin hamaare ummidavaar ke liye hikaarat ke bhav se unhone baat kii or unako vot dene waalon se kaha ki inke badale sidhe bijepi ko hi vot de den
 i strongly condemn his statement
 javed ji ko apni mashhooriyat kaa istemaal itane halke dhang se nahin karnaa chahie
 According to Shivanand, if the CPI really wants to defeat the fascist forces, then they should retire their candidate from Begusarai
 media ne desh bhar main kanhaiya kaa jalawaa bana diya he
 But there is no Begusarai land under Kanhaiya's feet
 argedy netaa ne kaha ki mahagathbandhan ke hamaare ummidavaar tanwir hasan vigat loksabhaa chunaav main bhi rajd (RJD) kii ore se begusarai se chunaav lade the
 Tanveer ji got three lakh sixty thousand votes
 sipiai bhi nitish ji kii party se gathbandhan banaakar ladi thi
 He received less than two lakh votes
 aaj sipiai kanhaiya ko ummidavaar banaakar akele lard rahi he
 He said that there are seven assembly constituencies in the Begusarai Lok Sabha
 inamen se paanch vidhansabha kshetron main mahagathbandhan ke vidhayak hai
 The CPI has also contested the previous assembly
 kaisaa haal tha, yah unako samaran hoga
 In such a situation, fighting your CPI candidate there is like helping the BJP
 isliye sipiai se anurodh he ki apana ummidavaar waapas lekar mahagathbandhan ke ummidavaar tanwir hasan kaa samarthan kare

 2017 main kai aisi prakritik aapadaaen ain jinhone duniya ko jhakzor kar rakh diya
 But in 2018, it is not going to be relaxed
 is saal bukamp ek badi prakritik aapadaa kaa rup le saktaa he
 a report came in August 2017 itself, stating that the pace of earthquakes would increase in the new year
 2018 main 7 level se adhik ke kai jatke duniya ko hilaa sakate hai
 This report was released by the University of Colorado
 report main is baat kaa daawa kiya gaya tha ki bukamp kaa level 9
 Can go up to 0 as well
 2018 main kareeb 20 aise bukamp aa sakate hai
 According to the report, the moment the Earth enters rotation mode, then there is a high probability of earthquake
 is samay tectonic plate ke roteshan kaa samay he, jo bada khatra sabit ho saktaa he
 If the report turns out to be true and 7 to 9
 0 level tak ke bukamp aate hai to uske baad halke jhatkon kii bhi ashanka bad sakati he
 The report said that such an earthquake could shake Western America, Southern Europe, Middle East, South America and other areas
 na sirf bukamp, balki jwalamukhi bhi is saal duniya kii musiibat badha sakate hai
 However, these things have not been confirmed in the report
 vigyaan aisa bilkul nahin kahata he ki bukamp kaa pehle se hi pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Scientists have only guessed this
 neshnal arthquek information centre har saal kareeb 20,000 bukamp record karata he, jisamen se 100 bukamp aise hote hai, jinase nuksaan hota he
 That is why earthquakes are made up of four layers - inner core, outer core, mantle and crust
 crust or upree mental ko lithosphere kaha jaataa he
 Lithosphere is 50 km thick layer
 ye parat virgon main banty he or inhen tectonical plates kehete hai
 Earthquakes occur when the movement in these tectonical plates intensifies
 yahi nahin, ulka ke prabhaav or jwalamukhi visphot or mine testing or newclear testing kii vajah sebhi bukamp atehain
 Such measurements measure seismic intensity seismographs are used to determine the intensity and duration of earthquakes
 is yantra ke jariye dharti main hone vaali halchal kaa graph banaaya jaataa he, jise seismogram kehete hai
 Based on this, the intensity of earthquake waves, the epicenter of the earthquake and the energy emanating from it are determined through mathematical scales (richter scale)
 seismograph kaa ek hissaa aisa hota he, jo bukamp aane par bhi nahin hilta or anya hisse hilne lagate hai
 The part that does not move keeps on recording the intensity of the earthquake
 isi ke aadhaar par seismogram taiyaar hota he, jo bukamp kii sateek jaankaree hasil karne main madad karata he
 The Richter scale measuring it was developed by American scientist Charles Richter in the year 1935
 richter scale par prayek agali ikai pichhali ikai kii tulana main 10 guna adhik tivrata rakhti he

 When Rahul Gandhi was asked this question in an interview given to an English newspaper
 to rahul ne kaha ki main aapako suspence main hi rakhana chaahunga, suspence hameshaa bura nahin hota he
 When Rahul was once again asked if Priyanka is certain to contest from Varanasi, he said that neither am i doing yes nor will i refuse
 gauratlab he ki jab se priyanka gandhi kii raajnneeti main entry hui he, tabhi se aisi atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim ki vah piem modi ko sidhaa chunauti de sakati hai
 When he was put in charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, these speculations caught up even more
 raajnneeti main entry ke baad jab priyanka ne purvi uttar pradesh kaa daura kiya to vah prayagraj se hote hue varanasi tak pahunchin
 Here he visited temples, met people and talked to workers about winning elections

 "the court has also questioned whether the procedure adopted for Sanjay Dutt's release is the same for ordinary inmates? Sanjay Dutt has never received 30 days of parole for his daughter's nose surgery
 He was released on parole due to his wife's poor health
 unhen kai baar furlo par bhi rihaai di gai

 The Bench asked- Was the Police Inspector General (jail) consulted or was the Jail Superintendent sent suggestions directly to the Governor? How the authority decided to treat Sanjay Dutt well
 sarkaar ko yah samajhane kaa aakhir mauka kab mil gaya jab sanjay dutt zyaadaatar vakt parole par jail se baahar hi rahe
 a PIL on the release of Sanjay Dutt was being heard in the High Court

 Delhi took nine wickets for Madhya Pradesh's 132 runs at stumps on the opening day of Ranji Trophy Elite group-b with the superb bowling of their spinners Vikas Mishra (six wickets) and Shivam Sharma (three wickets)
 bisisiai ke niyamon ke anusaar, pichon ko taiyaar karne ke liye tatasth curator ko bheja jaataa he, taaki gharelu timen koi phayda na uthaa saken

 He is from Dharamshala and knows about the weather in North India
 pich par shaam chaar baje ke aasapaas pani daalaa gaya
 According to BCCI rules, when the match officials came to the ground in the morning, Chauhan was supposed to be present to hand over the field to the match referee, but he was nowhere to be seen
 adhikari ne kaha, ‘chouhan ko pehle din lunch tak vahaan ruknaa tha

 PTI could not get Chauhan's response in this matter
 bisisiai ke mahaprabandhak (cricket sanchaalan) sabaa kareem ne sweekaar kiya ki is sthiti ko taala ja saktaa he or unhone chouhan se report maangi he
 Karim told PTI, 'I agree that what happened at Kotla should not have happened, but i believe that due to some compulsion, Chauhan may have left early
 unhone dilli se subah 10 baje udaan bhari
 Generally, they have never done this, so i would like to believe that there must have been a reason behind it

 ) 25 april kaa din tha
 It was eight thirty in the morning
 isi bich pune ke dattanagar memrihaayshi ilakemen lage ek sisitivi camere main kuch ajeeb sa kaid hota he
 The first thing between two people is heard saying something and then soon the saying turns into a frenzy
 lekin inamen se ek shaks kuch zyada hi baichaiyn he
 He starts to look for something out of the push
 or phir agle pal wo ek haath main ek pathar liye aage badhata he
 The second person is unaware of his coming time in this skirmish taking place in the parking area, but this time as soon as he encounters the first person, he puts the head of the other person with the stone directly in his hand
 ye hamalavar he dhananjay mor, jabaki shikaar he abhijit maarane
 Both are neighbors
 iske baad jo kuch hota he, vaisaa koi soch bhi nahin saktaa
 Abhijeet falls down immediately after Dhananjay Peacock's stone falls and starts splashing, but Dhananjay's anger is increased rather than calm
 wo usee pathar se dobaaraa abhijit par waar karata he, lekin iske baad wo ek second bhi nahin rukta, balki bechaini se phir kuch talashne lagata he
 Abhijeet, who fell on the pillar, is suffering
 iske chand seconds ke baadahamalavardhananjay phir se camere ke saamne namoodaar hota he, lekin is baar ek vishaal or baari pathar ke saath or phir wo yahi pathar zamin par gire abhijit par de martha he
 This is followed by one, two, three, four
 
 
 or is tarah ek-ek kar wo is bade se pathar se abhijit ko puredas baar kuchaltahai
 Sometimes he hits the stone on Abhijeet's head, sometimes on the chest, sometimes on the waist, sometimes on the legs
 
 
 har waar ke saath jameen par padaa abhijit tadap uthta he, bilabila uthta he, hosh or behoshee ke darmyaan raham kii bheekh maangata he
 Moreover, by holding the stone with his injured hands, he tries to stop his attacker from attacking himself further, but Halavar Dhananjaya does not take the name of stopping
 ye sab kuch itnaa bhayanak he ki is manjar par nigahen tikaa paanaa bhi mushkil hota he, lekin hamalavar he ki uskaa dil nahin pasijata
 He also gets rid of his anger by kicking in the middle once in a while and scares away the people who get trapped around
 bachaane ke liye koi aage nahin aayaab aaie, aapako ek duusare camere se is vaakye kii ek or tasviir dikhaate hai
 This camera clearly shows how Dhananjay More is crushing Abhijeet, who falls on the ground, but despite tens of people standing in the parking space there, he does not dare to get close to Dhananjay
 or phir jab dhananjay jab waar dar waar kar buree tarah thak chukaa hota he, kuch mahilaayein jameen par gir kar rone lagati hai, to wo kuch mahilaayein hi hoti hai, jo aage bad kar dhananjay ko rokatii hai or phir uski halki-phulki pitayee hoti he
 The injured Abhijeet keeps on suffering till then
 yahaan se dhananjay apane mobile par kisi se baat karata he or phir fouran hi maukey se nikal bhaagta he
 In fact, Dhananjay, who lives in the flats face to face, had doubts that Abhijeet has some closeness with his wife and it is difficult to believe what Dhananjay did on the basis of this single doubt
 lekin tasviren kabhi jhooth nahin bolti he
 Now, the situation is that while Abhijeet is swinging between life and death in a hospital for a number of fractures on the body, Dhananjay is that the police has not been able to reach him despite almost ten days of passing

 notebandi ke elaan ke baad pradhanmantri modi ne logon se 50 din kii mohalat maangi or logon ko vishwaas dilaayaa ki 50 din baad halaat saamaanya ho jaaenge
 PM Modi said that after 50 days people will not have to bear the cash shortage
 lagbhag dedh maheenaa yani 45 din baad dilli aaj tak ke sanvadaataaon ne alag-alag jagahon par atm kii kataron kaa gauge liya
 First stop- Connaught Place, called Connaught Place, the heart of Delhi, where 5 atms were found simultaneously but cash was in only one
 baaki ke atm band
 In such a situation, the queue of people in the current ATM is lazy
 sawaal yahi he ki agar baaqi ke atm bhi kaam kar rahe hote to ye line or choti hoti or logon ko raahat milti
 Next stop- Karol Baghayhan got three atms together but it was clear from the desperate faces of people that these atms were closed
 logon kii maane to ilaake main 5 atm hai lekin chalata ek bhi nahin
 Even if someone walks, it has a long line
 ab notebandi ke dedh maheene baad bhi in kharaab pade yaa cashles atm ke liye koun zimmedaar he?aglaa padaav- pahadganjpahadganj market chote vyapaariyon kaa garh he, isiilie yahaan sirf cash se kaarobaar chalata he
 But see the irony there are total 4 atms in the market lane, but hardly any ATM makes money
 ab aise main log sirf cash kaa intazaar hi karte rahete hai
 Next stop - 7 bank atms were found simultaneously in Dariyaganjdariyaganj, but the same problem deteriorated and closed atms there too
 yaha sirf 1 hi atm chaalu haalat main mila jisamen qatari laazmi he
 Actually there is no action for closed atms
 aglaa padaav- sarita vihaar / okhlasarita vihaar market main bhi atm kaa haal behaal he
 There are 5 atms but no cash was found in any
 vahiin badarpur main bhi 6 atm hai lekin cash kisi main nahin
 Overall, the result of the ATM journey turned out that many atms in Delhi still had cash shortage even after 46 days

 colombo test ke pehle din bhartiya captain viraat kohli ne toss jitkar jab ballebaazi kaa faisla liya to unhone nahin sochaa hoga ki team india kii shuruyaat behad kharaab hogi
 In the very first over, Dhumika Prasad drove Murali Vijay, but the special thing was that Team India did not send Rohit Sharma as the number three batsman
 jis rohit sharma ko team ke captain or diarector number 3 kaa sabase behatar ballebaaz bataate rahe, unhen srilanka ke tej gendbaazon se bachaane kii koshish kii gai or ajinkya rahane ko pramot karke number 3 ballebaaz ke taur par bheja gaya
 Obviously, this change has not been good for Ajinkya Rahane as well and he was dismissed by just four runs
 rahane ne 11 gend khelkar 4 ran banaae
 He was caught in the third slip trying to play the ball going out of Dhumika Prasad's off stump away from his body
 rahane kaa ye 17waan test tha or unhen pehali baar number teen ballebaaz ke taur par utaara gaya
 This was an attempt to ease Rohit Sharma's pressure in exchange for giving Rahane a chance, but the team management's stance turned upside down
 haalanki is koshish ne rohit sharma kii team india main maujuudagi par or zyada sawalia nishaan laga diya he
 All this is happening when the best number 3 batsman of the current team is forced to sit on the bench
 rohit sharma ne number 3 ballebaaz ke taur par 3 test main kareeb 26 kii ausat se 107 ran banaae hai, jabaki cheteshwar pujaara ne number 3 ballebaaz ke taur par 24 test maichon main 49 se zyada kii ausat se 1814 ran banaae hai
 It also includes 6 centuries
 aise main number 3 ballebaaz ke taur par cheteshwar pujaara ko baahar karne kaaran keval viraat kohli or ravi shastri hi bataa sakate hai
 Fielding coach r Sridhar of the Indian team revealed that Ajinkya Rahane became India's best slip fielder after taking hundreds of catches during the practice session, not overnight
 bahut mehnat karte hai rahaneshridhar ne ek pari main sabase zyada kaich lene kaa world ricard banane vaale rahane ke bare main kaha, 'vah (rahane) behtareen slip fielder ke rup main tabdeel ho gaya he
 He has the passion to become a good slip fielder
 usne iske liye vastav main bahut mehnat kii
 He took hundreds of catches and his attitude is clear on what he wants to do, where he wants those catches, how high he wants the catches to come in the match
 'behtareen slip fielder hai ajinkya rahaneunhone aage kaha, 'iske alaava vah acchhee tarah se samajhataa he ki kaich kis kone or kitni teji se aa saktaa he
 Earlier we had talked about Dharna and she prepared herself in every way to stand in the slip
 vah ek achche slip fielder ke rup main taiyaar ho gaya he jo ki team ke liye acha he
 'slip should have a permanent combination
 Shridhar stressed the need for a permanent combination in the slip area which is necessary for the success of the team
 unhone kaha, 'ham slip kshetra main sthai sangyojan pasand karte hai lekin choton par hamaara niyantran nahin he
 You must have seen in Sri Lanka
 shikhar dhawan or murali vijay chotil ho gaye
 After this, Lokesh Rahul had to stand in the slip
 viraat kohli or ajinkya kaa acha slip kshetrarakshak hona hamaare liye phaayde vaali baat he
 We want a permanent combination but when it is not under our control, we keep the best available fielder in slip
 'slip ke liye ban rahi hai nai yojanaayenshridhar ne kaha, 'iske alaava hamaari yojana baayen haath ke ballebaaj ke liye oudside slip main baayen haath ke khilaadi or daaen haath ke ballebaaj ke liye daaen haath ke khilaadi ko outside slip main rakhane kii he
 When asked about the best fielders from India and South Africa, Sridhar said, 'you can say that AB de Villiers is a good fielder but i believe Ravindra Jadeja is a natural athlete
 hamaari team main prayek khilaadi kuch hatakar karata he jisase vah samuhik taur par acchhee kshetrarakshak ikai ban gayi he
 He refused to give ratings to fielders
 He said, "virat is energetic
" ajinkya kareebi kshetrarakshak ke rup main chapal he
 If someone is calm, Shikhar is an amazing athlete
 isliye yah kshetrarakshan main bahut acchhee team he
 'sridhar praised the team's fielding performance in Mohali but made it clear that he did not want to give ratings to the fielders
 unhone kaha, 'prayek ke prayaas ko reating dena mere liye mushkil hoga lekin ek team or captain ke rup main viraat jo isse chahta he or yuva cricketron ke rup main ye khilaadi jo kar rahe hai vah sudhaar kii prakriya he

 " It has been three and a half months since the formation of Captain Amarinder Singh's government in Punjab, but there is also a minister in the Punjab government who has not visited his office in the CM Secretariat even once in these 3 months
 haa, apana mantri pad kaa charge lene ke liye jarur gaye the
 But, these ministers never looked in their office after that
 isaki vajah thi offis kaa luk inaki profile or style ke mutabik nahin tha
 We are talking about Navjot Singh Sidhu, Punjab's high profile and high profile minister
 ek taraf punjab sarkaar kahati he ki viipi culture ko khatm karnaa he or kharchon main katautee kerani he
 On the other hand, the situation is that farmers in Punjab are continuously committing suicide, and the third situation is that a lot of schemes have stopped in Punjab due to lack of money, but in spite of all this, there is no one in the comfort and glory of Minister Mahadev
 There has not been any shortage and work has continued in Navjot Singh Sidhu's office for more than 3 months
 'aaj tak' kii team ne navjot singh siddhu ke five star tip karyaalay kaa ek jayja liya
 On the one hand, the Chief Minister of Punjab was today citing his hundred days saying that we have cut expenses, abolished VIP culture and on the other hand this luxurious office of Sidhu Sahab
 is offis main abhi tak siddhu sahab ke charan camel ek baar bhi naa padhanaa jaahir si baat he
 The opposition has tried its best to surround the government on this issue
 Former Cabinet Minister Daljit Cheema says that Sidhu has no meaning with the public nor his office
 punjab se zyada mumbai main vakt bitaate hai or offis par kharch katautee ke baavjood karodon rupye kharch karnaa bataata he ki sarkaar kis kadar punjab ke liye chintaa main dubi hui he
 At the time when the renovation work started in Navnjot Singh Sidhu's office, at that time Navjot Singh Sidhu himself and his wife Navjot Kaur, including many ministers of Punjab, said that no expenditure is being done only in this room, but this color is being done Nearly 50 lakh government treasury has been spent in Rogan and the entire furniture to floor and ceiling has been replaced
 lekin,congress ke mantrior siddhu ke sahyogi abhi bhi ise ek mahal kii jarurat hi bataa rahe hai

 # keralafloods— Suniel Shetty (@sunielvshetty)august 16, 2018 The Pune police claimed to have solved the case of the murder of a child named Shubh Rawal
 diardio karmchaaree ke paanch saal ke bete shubh kaa shav somvaar ko baraamad kiya gaya tha
 According to the police, Shubh was kidnapped for the purpose of obtaining a ransom of five lakh rupees, but was later strangled to death

 Both the accused are minors

 In developed and democratic societies, sometimes some debate is reached that those who do not work without being manipulated and torn apart
 shuruyaat main yah tay karnaa mushkil hota he ki in bahason se bachane main musiibat ghategi yaa inhen udhed dene se aaraam milegaa, lekin itnaa jarur mahasoos hota he ki inhen jas kaa tas chhodana naammumkin he
 In the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) incident, excluding the excitement of the students or the police militancy that was immediate, the debate of nationalism seems to be in our hands which wants to make its place within India's liberal democracy
 darasal, yah bahes dashakon se hamaare aasapaas khadbada rahi he or fat padana chaahati he
 This is the most appropriate opportunity for this debate, not because the debate of nationalism versus liberal democracy has started suddenly but the intellectual society of India is equipped with the ax to handle such debate
 bahason se darana yaa vimarsh main shadyantr gholna hamaari fitrat main nahin he
 The debates of identity, philosophy, thought, identity and nationalism have floated, collided, and trembled around us for hundreds of years, as we are a diverse society that seeks strength to divide
 rashtrawaad banaam loktantreey udaarvaad kii taaja bahes in puraani bahason kaa shikhar he, jo bhartiya samaaj ke buniyadi mulyon ke punarmoolyankan kii ter lagaati he or yathasthiti se asahmati jaahir karti he
 Nationalism is a spirit and liberal democracy a rational system
 is takaraav main aatishbaajee lajimi he
 Nevertheless, we have to be ready for the shaking of this debate once again
 is dauraan hamaari yah dharna tuutegi ki udaaravaadi loktantr main sab kuch nyaaysangat hi he to duusari taraf rashtravaadi aagrah uparashtriyataon or asmita ko bahason kii taraf bhi mode sakate hai
 The debate of cultural nationalism and liberal democracy can be called the existential debate of India's political society, but what is the difference
 jinda kaumon ne duniya main aisi bahasein kii hai or unase raste nikaale hai
 The debate that began in 1955 by Rosa Parks, who works in a department store, refusing to give up the bus seat reserved for white people, was related to the existence of American society, but in 1964 the US Civil Rights Act came out of this discussion and American society accepted liberation from apartheid despite all its inherent divisions
 kya pichhali sadi main europe ne apni jaateey, rashtravaadi or aarthik samprabhutaaon ko aapas main gholne par lambii bahes nahin kii or europea union nahin banaai
 This decision was not easy for Europe
 aaj agar britain us europea sangh se alag hona chahta he to uskaa rasta janabahas main talasha gaya he, kyonki britain ke paas ek majboot samvidhan or ek jaagruk janasamudaay he jo is tarah kii astitvvaadi bahason ko bakhubi sambhaal saktaa he
 Those who regard bitter opposing disagreements as treason forget that India incidentally has a modern constitution
 punjab se lekar uttar-purv algaavvaad tak kii khuli bahasein isi samvidhan kii chaaya main huin
 These debates were certainly not safe
 inase pidaa mili lekin ek sakasham desh ne apni puri jaagrukta ke saath us dard ko jiya or bahason ko sarv sahmati par sthir hone kaa mauka diya
 We have recently concluded a debate on the legislature and judiciary rights (appointment of judges) in which the court and the government did not rip each other off
 rashtrawaad banaam udaar loktantr kii bahes ke liye yah sabase makul mauka isliye he, kyonki ek aisi vichaardhaara se nikali party satta main he jo bhartiya loktantr ke kam se kam kuch buniyadi mulyon se asahmati rakhti he
 On the other hand, there is a group of supporters of liberal democracy which, while in power for a long time, never gave respectable place to the other party in big debates
 isliye ab agar sajag bahes hoti he to usamen shaamil pakshon ke paas anubhavon, itihaas or sandarbhon kaa paryaapt sajo-samaan maujuud hoga
 In this debate of nationalism and liberal democracy, all we have to do is to ensure that the power remains neutral because there is no nationalism in the system
 yah bahes agar samaaj se swatahsfoort uthe (na ki sajishan) to shaayad ham zyada phaayde main honge
 Liberal democracy is India's largest international identity which distinguishes it from its counterparts like China, Russia
 atah bahes ko hamen is tarah se sanchalit karnaa hoga ki kisi nattejey par pahunchane tak ham apni antarrashtriya chhavi ko ghayal na kar len
 In India, power has always been weak in front of society
 francis phukuyama (da origins of political order) thik hi likhte hai ki bharat main rajnatik satta aam logon kii jindagi main ek seemaa se adhik kabhi praasangik nahin rahi jabaki china main saamaajik takatein satta kii shakti ke saamne hameshaa kamjor rahi hai
 The participants of this debate have to keep in mind that nationalism is ultimately concentrated in the strength of a race, caste or power and it is manifested only by its symbols
 rashtrawaad or udaaravaadi loktantr kii is bahes ke bahaane bharat kaa samaaj agar apni takat kii uplabdhiyon or ulajhanon ko nae sire se parakhnaa chahta he to harj kya he
 Whatever be the decision, but through debate we will at least know what are the political political designs of the two camps about India
 vaicharik muddon par sajishein chhodkar hamen ek baar yah tay kar lenaa chahie ki ikkisvin sadi kaa yuva, shikshit or jaagruk bharat apane liye kaisaa bharat chahta he
 How much nationalism, how much liberalism, what kind of democracy, what kind of symbols, what kind of society, what kind of economy

 There has been a big irregularity in promotion of two secretariat related services in Railway Board
 aadhikarik sutron ne bataaya ki rail mantralay ke kuch adhikari railway kii do kam jaani pahachaani sevaaon- railway board sachivalay seva (arabses) or railway board sachivalay lipikeey seva (arabssies) main uchit prakriya kaa paalan kiye bina or cabinet ke adhikaar kshetra kii upeksha kar adhikariyon ko pramot karte paae gaye hai
 He said that the officers' neglect of railway services of Group 'A' like Indian Railway Service of Mechanical Engineer (IRSME), Indian Railway Personal Service (IRPS) and even IAS without meeting the standard of minimum 16 years experience of service
 The tax is being promoted to higher administrative grade (HAG) and senior administrative grade (SAG)
 echegi or esaiji ko kramash: ek atirikt sachiv or sanyukt sachiv str kaa adhikari diya jaataa he
 Sources said that SAG is currently given to an officer who normally belongs to Central Secretariat Service (CSS) after completing 23 years of service, Group a railway service officer after 23 years of service and IAS officer
 After 20 years of service
 unhone kaha ki arabses main kai adhikariyon ko aavashyak jaruraton ko puraa kiye bina esaiji grad diya ja rahaa he, jabaki unhen group ‘bi’ seva main bhartee kiya gaya tha
 Calling it a "grave mistake", the Finance Ministry recently wrote to the Railways to cancel its decision to promote these officers for which orders were issued almost a year ago
 vitt mantralay ke tahat vyay vibhaag ne ullekh kiya ki ‘‘arabses or arabssies ke cader kaa purnagathan karte samay rail mantralay ne maamla sweekruti ke liye is vibhaag ko nahin bheja or ulte mantrimandal kii manjuuri ke bina esaiji str ke paanch atirikt pad srujit kar die’’
 It said in a tightly worded official letter to the Railways, "this is a serious flaw on the part of the officials responsible for placing the factual position and the terms and conditions before the decision making authority"
 niyamon ke mutabik esaiji str se neeche ke pad srujit karne ke liye vitt mantri or str se upar ke sanyukt sachiv tathaa anya pad srujit karne ke liye kendriya mantrimandal kii manjuuri aavashyak hoti he
 "it would be appropriate to mention that there are financial complexities in the cadre review which require concurrence from the Department of Expenditure (DOE)," the message said
 railway board ko purv main bhi is bare main avgat karaayaa ja chukaa he
 DOE cited another example in which the Railway Board has sought its consent for the process of in-house cadre reorganization of Group c and Gru d personnel in the Ministry of Railways
 sandesh main kaha gaya he ki tab group si karmiyon ke in-house cader punargathan kii manjuuri dete hue, ‘‘rail mantralay ko spasht rup se kaha gaya tha ki group e or group bi sevaaon kii cader samiksha lagaataar is mantralay ko bheji jaati rahe
 It would be appropriate to mention that these officers of RBSS and RBSCS are responsible for the management of Group a cadre in the Railways
 arabses or arabssies karmi, jinaki sankhya kareeb 500 he, rail mantralay main saamaanya prashasan staff ke rup main kaam karte hai

 is dauraan unhone daliton ke gusse or ambedkar ke masale par apni baat rakhi
 On a question about the displeasure of Dalits in the country, Paswan said, “the anger of Dalits is natural

 There were people of our generation, who tolerated the oppression and listened to the abuse, but the people of the new generation want to live a life of honor and respect

 kyonki hamaare jo aadmi hai, dalit varg ke log hai, wo aaj bhi bahut pichde hue hai

 pehle senior afasar uski jaanch kare ki wo sahi he yaa nahin
 However, we made it under Section 15 (4) of the constitution, which requires special provision for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, then can make laws
 jab unase poocha gaya ki aakhir rivyuu petishan daakhil karne main modi sarkaar kii ore se der kyon kii gai? iske jawaab main paswan ne kaha, “ab court ne kaha ki jail nahin hoga, to gussa hamaare (sarkaar) par kyon tha? gussa to court ke jajment ke khilaaf tha
 We were also angry, so Chiragpaswan from our party immediately filed a review petition
 ''unhone kaha ki iske baad ham log pradhanmantri se mili
 On this, PM Modi said that we will file a review petition
 is bich chah din kii chuttee ho gai, lekin ham is baat ko maanate hai ki agar lau ministry or department active rahata, to dikkat nahin hoti
 By sitting at the same time, instead of having the paper go from here to there, files could come from there, because the government had decided
 court kaa rukh sunne ke baad bhi aap adhyadesh ke paksh main hai? is paralok janashakti party ke pramukh pasvanka kahana tha, “court kaa kya jajment hoga, wo to hamaare haath main nahin he
 But yes, we announce on behalf of the government, because the PM had formed the High Power Committee, we have taken this decision

 jisase bharat ko aarthik nuksaan ho
 Zawahiri has said that al Qaeda is building a new group

 al-zawahiri criticized Pakistan's Kashmir plan in the video, but exposed Pakistan's saying that Pakistan sends Mujahid to Kashmir
 taaja video main jawahiri ke ek taraf bandook rakhi he to ek taraf quran
 The army and the agency are on alert after this video

 Hameed hails from South Kashmir and is close to Zakir Musa

 pichley kareeb 12 din se asaram baapu police ke saath aankh-michauli khel rahe the
 And ran away from place to place to avoid arrest
 lekin shaayad wo ye bhul gaye the ki kanoon ke haath lambey hote hai or yahi haath asaram ke girebaan tak pahunch hi gaye
 When the police tightened the grip, Bapu stopped speaking
 lekin ye to he ki asaram ne bhi police se kaaphi mashktat karwaai
 Asaram performed several dramas before and after his arrest
 padhie inke bare main
 
 
 If no great work came, Asaram Bapu did a drama for several days to avoid arrest
 phir unke samarthakon ne media ke logon ke saath marpet kii hangaamaa kiya
 But after doing all the pranapaks, neither Asaram Bapu nor Parmathakas of the Law Poles did
 or aakhirkaar naaballig ke yon utpeedan karne ke aarope main police ne asaram baapu ko giraftaar kar hi liya
 But to arrest Bapu, the police also had to struggle a lot
 31 agastaraat 8

 jodhpur police ke indore pahunchate hi asaram kii giraftaar kii sargarmi tej ho gai
 But till then, there was no police support from his ashram or Asaram
 raat 8

 ashram ke baahar police asaram ko giraftar kii taiyaari kar rahi thi
 But Asaram was absorbed in his satsang inside
 raat 9

 indore ke ashram se jodhpur police ne asaram ko giraftaar kiya
 Asaram did not cooperate with the police
 jodhpur police ke mutabik baapu unke sawaalon kaa santoshjanak jawaab nahin de rahe the
 Asaram was arrested only when the police team did not get answers to his questions
 subah 6 bajeasaram kaa medical checkpapulice ne indore airport par hi asaram kaa medical chekup kiya gaya

 After two hours of flight, police reached Delhi with Asaram
 flite main asaram ne kaha ki main bekasoor hum mujhe fansaaya ja rahaa he
 Asaram supporters at the airport at 10 am were Asaram inside the Jamwadadilly airport and Asaram's supporters were outside the airport
 or wo baapu kii giraftaar kaa virodh kar rahe the
 The flight from Delhi to Jodhpur departed from Delhi to Jodhpur at 11 am
 
 At 12 noon, when Bajajodhpur Airport arrived, Asharam arrived, at that time there were a large amount of security arrangements, five RPF companies were deployed
 dopaher 12
 30 Police taken from Bajezodhpur Airport When the Jodhpur Police took Asaram from the airport, Asaram once again said that he was being implicated
 lekin asaram ne thane jane se manaa kar diya
 He said that if he went to the police station, he would become impure
 
 The police continued to roam for 40 minutes at 1 o'clock in the afternoon
 The Jodhpur police continued to roam around for 40 minutes
 kabhi unhen dangiyavaas to kabhi madi kuti le jaaya gaya
 At 2 pm, after exhausting Asaram at the RAC guest house and driving Asaram across the city, the police rushed to the guest house of the First Battalion of RAC carrying Bapu
 philhal police ne asaram baapu ko isi guestaouse main rakhaa hua he or wo unase poochtacha kar rahi he
 The police kept on questioning Asaram till 4 pm and when he did not answer the police's questions properly, at around 5 pm the police presented him in the court and asked for his two-day remand
 lekin court ne sunwaayee ke baad asaram ko ek din kii police castady main bhej diya
 Asaram showed many leela to avoid arrest
 police ko gumraah karne ke liye kai bayaan die
 But still could not escape arrest
 indore se giraftaar karne or jodhpur pahunchane ke baad police bhale hi asaram ko kareeb 40 minute tak shahar bhar main idhar se udhar ghumaati rahi lekin aakhir main asaram ko aarasi yani aarasi kii first batalian ke guestaouse le jaakar vahaan unase poochtacha shuru kii or shaam paanch bajte-bajte police ne asaram ko adaalat main pesh kiya or court se asaram kaa do din kaa remand maanga
 And after the hearing, the court gave the police a day's custody of Asaram
 court se ek din kii police remand main bheje jane ke baad khaaki vardi waalon se ghire asaram behad shant or niraash andaaj main police kii gaadi main baith gaye
 'I want to spend the night in the ashram' After playing hide and seek with the police for 12 days, Asaram tried his best to escape from the police
 court main unhone kaha ki wo raat apane ashram main hi bitaana chaahate hai
 However, his demand was rejected in court
 court main asaram ne kaha ki police castady ke dauraan mujhe ashram main hi rahane diya jaae
 Has cooperated in the inquiry and will do so further
 main jail yaa hawalat main nahin rahanaa chahta
 i have had to do yoga asana or sadhana which cannot be done in hawala
 is par court ne kaha ki abhi to police aapse poochtacha karegi
 Again on Monday
 
 
 tab dekhenge
 
 
 The police will take over the incident after the police took Asaram to Madai Ashram
 naaballig ke mutabik asaram ne vahiin uske saath yon shoshan kiya tha
 It is said that the police, along with the questioning of Asaram, will react to the entire incident and try to find out the truth of the allegations
 darasal asaram police kii poochtacha se bachane ke liye hi itane dinon se idhar se udhar bhaage-bhaage phir rahe the
 But now Bapu will not be able to run anywhere nor will he be able to show any new Leela
 ab jo bhi lila dikhaani hogi wo police dikhaaegi
 Now it remains to be seen what form the police shows to Bapu
 ab baapu chaahe jo marji rup dhare or jo chaahe lila dikhaaen lekin philhal to unhen police ke sawaalon kii bauchhaar jhelni padegi
 And perhaps that's why Asaram's speech is closed
 asaram se puche ye sawalaresi ke guest house main police ne 4 ghante tak asaram se poochtacha kii
 During this time, the police asked Bapu many questions about the allegations of sexual exploitation
 yahaan padhie aakhir kya the ye sawaal or saraam ne in sawaalon ke police ko kya jawaab die
 Police - How did this girl reach you? Asaram - His family is our servant
 ilaaj ke liye ladki ai thi
 Police - Why was called in Madai Kutia instead of Jodhpur Ashram? Asaram - The family had expressed our desire to see the hut
 police- ladki ko kamare main akele kyon le gaye?asaram- bacchee ne andar se kutiyaa dekhne kii jid kii thi
 Nobody goes there except me
 usne dharm karm kii baaten sunne kii ichha jataai thi
 Went because of ilse
 police- ladki dedh ghante tak kamare main kya kar rahi thi?asaram- bacchee dharmik pravriti kii thi
 Dharma was talking about karma
 iske alaava koi baat nahin
 Police - Why did the girl accuse you? Asaram - i will not answer the accusations
 saare aarope galat hai
 Girl is my granddaughter
 police ke mutabik asaram ab jaanch main sahyog kar rahe hai
 However, the coming days can be even more troublesome for Asaram, because if the police investigate sexual exploitation in the investigation, then no one will be able to save Bapu from going to jail

 The person whom you and i know as Asaram Bapu were once smugglers of liquor

 The Aam Aadmi Party has accused the Modi government and the Union Home Ministry of spying on MP Bhagwant Mann
 party ne buudhvaar ko daawa kiya ki jab bhagwant maan bangaleru main swasthya laabh le rahe the, tab grih mantralay ke do afasaron ne bhagwant maan ke bare main poochtacha kii
 PM Modi is not interested in national issues, AAP leader Ashutoshka says that the Prime Minister of the country has no one else left
 wo sirf aam aadmi party ke netaaon kii jaankaree ikatthi karte hai or unke khilaaf karrwai karte hai
 Taking a dig at PM Modi, he said that terrorism is happening in the country, Dalits are being tortured, but they are not interested in national issues
 ashutosh ne modi sarkaar par netaaon kii nijee jindagi main dakhal dene kaa aarope lagaaya he
 According to him, 1
 jab bhagwant maan july main swasthya laabh ke liye bangaleru gaye the
 Then on 18 July, 2 Home Ministry officials came there and wanted to collect the information of Mann
 2
 The officers asked why Bhagwant Maan came here, how many days stayed, what treatment went on, whom he met
 un logon ne 19 july ko dobaaraa swasthya centre aakar jaankaree ikatthi karne kii koshish kii
 Bhagwant Manam Aadmi Party is not a terrorist, claims that this spying happened at the behest of the Modi government
 aap netaa ashutosh ne kaha ki bhagwant maan koi aatankwaadi nahin hai
 There is no theft nor there is any danger of security from them
 agarbhagwant maan apni nijee jindagi menja rahe hai to modi sarkaar vahaan kyon jasusi karvaa rahi thi? The love he had with Arju, the love he wanted to brighten his life, which beats in his songs
 jo uske khwaabon main khanakta tha
 That love became the message of his death
 dilli ke khyala main jo hua use chaahe aap horer kiling kahenge, honor kiling kahe yaa lav jehad kah len
 Whatever name you give, but in reality it is a thinking that is bent on ending love of another religion by considering it as a sin
 gaiyr majahab se pyaar kii sajaa23 saal ke ankit par majahab kii bediyon ne uski jindagi par maut kaa shikanja kas diya, use gaiyr majahab kii ladki se pyaar karne kii sajaa de di gai
 He was killed in the middle of a street crowd, in the middle of the road in Delhi
 ab naa to ankit rahaa, naa uski mohabbat rahi
 There are only a few devils who cover the religious sheet and they are the parents in front of which their son kosja-e-mohabbatadi went
 ghar kaa eklauta chiraag tha ankitankit kii maa kii aah ab kabhi khatm nahin hone vaali he
 The only son named Ankit
 naa doosraa bhai naa duusari bahan
 The son, who loved his mother dearly, talked about taking full responsibility of his father and family on his shoulders
 sochakar aapaki ruh kaanp jaaegi ki jawan bete kii jindagi haathon se phisalati dekhne vaali is maa par is vakt kya biit rahi hogi
 And what would be going on in the heart of this heartbroken father who saw the death of the daughter in a blink of an eye like a bird
 pashchimi dilli ke khyala main guuruuvaar kii raat kii ye khooni vaardaat hatya kaa ek maamla bhar nahin he, hatya hui ek mohabbat kii, ek maa kii mamata kii, or us pita kii ummiido kii
 But it is more than that the murder of the religion which Akit's murderers have tainted with their orthodox thinking
 parivaar kii harakat se beti khauf menjara sochie, beti ko apane dharm main byaahne ke liye maa-baap-mamaa-bhai sabane milakar hatya kaa aparaadh kiya
 The daughter now wants to live in Selter House instead of her house
 mohabbatka galaa kaatane vaali soch ke khilaaf wo khulkar khadi ho gai he
 But curse at the mob who kept watching a young man die and could not dare to extend a helping hand
 darasal khyala kisi behad main nahin, kisi registan main nahin, kisi syria yaa afghanistan main nahin
 Khyala is in Delhi
 jo duniya ke sabase bade loktantr kii rajdhani he or jahaan kaa samvidhan dharmanirpekshata kii duhai detaa he
 In the same Delhi, a boy is killed after falling in love with a non-religious girl
 ankit ke pita kaa bada arolag mazahab ke ladke se pyaar karne par ladki ke gharavaale behad naaraaz the
 In this resentment, he reached Ankit's house and the debate started
 bahes badhkar marpet tak ja pahunchi, ladki kii maa, mamaa, pita or naaballig bhai ne ankit kii maa tak se hathapayee kii
 Ankit's father says that the killers came fully prepared for the murder
 ankit ke mata-pita kaa kahana he ki agar hatya kii vajah duusare majahab kii ladki se mohabbat thi to inhen isaki koi jaankaree nahin, pita kaa sawaal he-agar ranjish mohabbat ko lekar hi thi to ladkee ke ghar vaale unke paas aate, unase baat karte
 Bindas was a young man Ankit was a 23-year-old cool young man
 apni jindagi apane andaaj main ji rahaa tha
 Used to photography, played guitar
 acting or modelling kaa shaukeen tha
 He was photographed with all the big actors and cricketers
 aawaara bvoy naam se uskaa fasebuk pej tha
 But he was unaware of the danger of falling in love with the girl of another religion and even that the day her life would be lost, people would keep watching the spectacle of her ruin from a distance
 ankit ke hatya ke aropiyon ko police ne philhal daboch liya he
 Locks are hanging at the house of the accused
 lekin aap or ham bhi jaanate hai ki insaaf hone tak ankit ke ghar waalon ko kya-kya jhelana pad saktaa he
 The religion that killed Ankit cannot be murdered, he is just a murderer
 inke liye majahab ek mukhauta he
 The girl's family murders the thinking that considers love to be the foundation of religion
 mohabbat ke bina majahab kya he
 a hollow thing, a tight eye
 ek andhi drushti yaa phir paagalpan
 Ankit's murder proved it again
 majahab ko thik se naa samajho to wo mahamari ban jaataa he

 a boy involved in Mumbai gang rape is a minor by age
 enditivi ko uskaa vah certificate mila he, jo uske janm ke vakt jari kiya gaya tha
 Accordingly, he is a minor
 ye certificate police ke daavon par sawaal khadey kar rahaa he
 The police commissioner had told the media that all the accused were adult
 lekin, ab ye certificate biemasi se mila he jo bataa rahaa he ki ek aaropee 26 farvari 1997 ko paidaa hua
 That is, he is under 18 years

 The police did not even bother to get the records removed from BMC
 ab kah rahi he haddi kii jaanch se umr tay karegi
 This question is also big because a minor was involved in the Delhi gang rape and after this there is a continuous debate that now the age limit should be reduced in crime
 agar mumbai police ek shaks ko balig sabit karne main naakaamayaab ho jaati he to phir iskaa cese alag se chalegaa or ye jald hi jail se baahar hoga

 High sources in the Indian Air Force have confirmed that Wing Commander Abhinandan Current had killed Pakistan's fighter aircraft F-16 on 27 February
 abhinandan ne epa-16 ko nishaanaa banane ke liye aar-73 missile kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Abhinandan did this before the mig-21 Bison was targeted with the Amaram missile
 isse yah saaf ho gaya he ki pakistan is dauraan epa-16 kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Sources in the Indian Air Force (IAF) told India Today TV that Abhinandan was the one who fired a missile on a Pakistani fighter plane during the air strike
 pakistani vaayu sena dwaara nishaanaa banaae jane se pehle apane antim radio transmishan main abhinandan ne conform kar diya tha ki unhone missile daagi thi
 Meanwhile, the Indian Air Force has also issued an explanation for the misinformation being spread on social media regarding the downfall of Pakistan's F-16
 IAF ne kaha ki 28 farvari 2019 ko hi bayaan jari kar bataaya gaya tha ki mig-21 bison ne hi pakistan ke epa-16 ko maar kar giraaya tha
 The Indian Air Force also clarified that Wing Commander Abhinandan is not active on social media
 twitor or instagram par unka koi acount nahin he
 So do not follow such fake account
 IAF ne isse saavdhaan rahane kii salaah di he
 Let me tell you that Pakistan Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan was caught by Pakistan during aerial operation, but due to diplomatic pressure he released him within three days

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who is also the state's Home Minister, could not defend his home department's order in front of the media on Wednesday to gather information regarding RSS leaders
 bihar police kii vishesh shakha ke tatkaaleen espi rajeev ranjan ne loksabhaa chunaav ke kuch din baad apane vibhaag ke dspi se aresas ke 19 sanghathanon ke netaaon or padaadhikariyon ke bare main report maangi thi
 When the copy of this report was received by the media, Nitish Kumar's government could not defend it even for a few hours
 buudhvaar kii subah haalanki rajya ke soochna mantri niraj kumaar ne ise ek routine report kahkar puure maamle par pani daal diya tha, lekin jaise hi bihar vidhaan parishad ke andar bhaajapa ke vidhaan parshad sanjay mayukh ne uthaaya or media main li hone kii jaanch kii maang kii uske baad sarkaar damege control main lag gai
 But after this dispute, where it is believed that this will increase the feeling of mistrust between Nitish and RSS
 vahiin special branch ke ADG jitendra singh gangavar ne jis prakaar se samvaadadaata sammelan kiya usase damege control to dur sarkaar or khaaskar mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii chhavi ke bare main log dabi jubaan se kehane lage ki dabaav main unhone espi se spashtikaran poochkar apane hi adhikariyon kaa manobal gira diya he
 In the press conference, Gangwar justified the circular issued by this SP that there was some intelligence that there was some danger on the leaders of RSS, so all the information was being collected
 vahiin espi se spashtikaran poochne par unke paas koi saafe jawaab nahin tha
 Gangwar too was clearly under pressure
 vah apane javaabon se patrakaron ko santusht kar paane main puri tarah se asafal dikhe
 After the press conference, the market of speculation heated up, and it is clear that Nitish Kumar is on the defensive on the issue
 bhaajapa kaa koi dawaab ho yaa na ho lekin unka dabaav apane hi maatahat police adhikariyon par adhik tha or yah lag rahaa tha apni sarkaar bachaane kii jugad main unhone ek baar phir is baat kii parvaah nahin kii ki ek routine kaam ke liye apane adhikari se spashtikaran poochkar ve ek galat parampara ko janm de rahe hai
 However, there have been many such incidents in recent times that even supporters of Nitish Kumar believe that under the pressure of politics or people around them, they have taken steps to break the morale of police officers
 sabase tazaa udhaaharan lakhisarai ke espi or patna ke gramin espi kaa tabadalaa chunaav ke turant baad isliye kar diya gaya ki nitish kumaar ke qareebi lalan singh jab munger se loksabhaa chunaav main pratyaashee the tab unke manmutabiq in adhikariyon ne kaam karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 Similarly, in the midst of the elections, Nitish Kumar revoked the suspension of two IPS officers, including Vivek Kumar, former SP of Muzaffarpur, and reinstated him
 jabaki vivek par mujffarpur main apane kaarykaal ke dauraan sharaab mafia ke saath santh ganth or aay se adhik sampatti rakhane kaa maamla khud bihar sarkaar ke vishesh nigaraanee vibhaag ne darj kiya tha
 But senior officials of Bihar Police say that Nitish Kumar is gradually failing to keep the morale of police officers high due to political compulsion from his decision and order

 This photo of Indira Gandhi is not known when and what happened, but it is true that Indira Gandhi visited the victims after the massacre of Dalits in Belchi, a village in Bihar, in 1977 while out of power
 
 is narsanhaar main 11 daliton kii hatya kar di gai thi
 Indira Gandhi reached Belchi on 13 August 1977 to meet the victims of the massacre, where there were flood-like conditions
 us samay baadh kii vajah se indira gandhi ko hathi par chadh kar belchi gaanv pahunchnaa padaa tha
 Indira Gandhi met the victim families and encouraged them
 kaha jaataa he ki belchi kii yatra ke baad se hi indira gandhi kii phir se satta vaapasi kii shuruyaat hui
 Journalist Janardan Thakur has mentioned this incident in his book All the Prime Ministers Men
 agast 1977 main belchi pahunchin indira gandhius samay times of india main reporter rahe hemendra narayan jha ne bhi indira gandhi kii belchi yatra par likhaa he
 Hemendra Narayan writes, "there are a variety of stories after Indira Gandhi came to Elephant on August 13, 1977

 Indira Gandhi reached Belchi after her defeat in the General Election after the Emergency

 At the airport, he announced that "I have come here to express my condolences to the relatives of the dead

 'belchi village is situated on the border of Patna district and nowadays it comes in Nalanda district
 harnaut-sakasohara road par yah gaanv 13 kilometre dur padataa he
 Harnaut is easily accessible via the highway
 hemendra narayan likhte hai, ‘tab yahaan baadh ai hui thi
 There was rain water all around the village
 indira gandhi pehle jeep se nikaleen, lekin keechad main jeep funs gai
 The jeep was pulled out of the tractor, but it did not work
 vah utar kar paidal hi chal padin
 Along with him, many leaders of Bihar Congress were also walking barefoot and as it was supposed to happen, it could not last long
 phir tay hua ki hathi ke alaava koi or saadhan nahin ho saktaa
 'indira Gandhi was accompanied by former MP from Delhi, Pratibha Singh
 mohane nadi se pehle narayanpur gaanv main indira gandhi hathi 'moti' par chadhin
 Pratibha Singh helped him in the offering
 nadi main pani badha hua tha, lekin hathi ko use paar karne main koi mushkil nahin hui
 The rest were crossed by a boat
 hemendra narayan bataate hai ki indira gandhi ne vah jagah dekhne kii ichha jaahir kii, jahaan logon kii hatya hui thi
 The place was among the corn fields on the edge of the village

 By that time, the dead bones of the dead were lying there
 chhapamaron ne unki hatya se pehle vahaan chitaayen taiyaar kin or phir daliton ko line main khadaa kar goli maar di thi
 According to Hemendra Narayan, the massacre of Dalits in Belchi was not the first incident in Bihar

 chaar ghante kii marathon poochtacha
 Another former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor and on the other hand, four police officers
 ek ke baad sawaalon kii lambii list
 When Tharoor came out after questioning, there were lines of concern on his face
 lekin kya vakisunanda pushkar hatyamaamle kii gutthi is poochtacha se sulajh jaaegi
 Look amazing, a year ago, on January 19, for the first time, Shashi Tharoor was asked questions regarding the death of his wife Sunanda Pushkar
 ek saal baad phir usee 19 janvari ko shashi tharur se dobaaraa unki bivi kii maut ke bare main sawaal puche jate hai
 But there are 10 such names, who can know who is the murderer of Sunanda! i do not know whether it will be called coincidence or change of date
 saal ke 365 din kaa pahiyaa yun ghamata he or phir puure saal bhar baad usee taarikh par aakar jaise hi thahartaa heshashi tharur phir se sawaalon ke ghere menhote hai
 Almost the same questions that were asked exactly a year ago and now again after a year
 haa, poochtacha kii jagah alag thi
 The faces were different
 tab esadm ne poochtacha kii thi, ab maamle kii jaanch ke liye banaai gai esaiti team poochtacha kar rah thi
 As far as the death of Sunanda is concerned, he was still in the dark even now
 saal bhar baad dilli police ne sunanda kii maut kaa raaj pataa karne ke liye jab maamle ko dfa 302 yani murder main darj kiya or jaanch ke liye nai team banaai gai
 The questioning ceremony was to be performed, so on January 19, it was also played
 kyonki hakeekat to yahi he ki saal bhar main cese ek inch bhi aage nahin khiskaa he
 Relationship with Pakistani journalist Meher Tarra from Shashi Tharoor, fight with Sunanda, fighting, fifteen marks of injury, misinformation of illness, giving prescription drugs over the year, 15 to 17 years ago, even a year ago Linking, as if only questions were asked
 poochtacha kii timming ko lekar savalkanoon ke jaankaar poochtacha kii timming ko lekar bhi sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 The question is that apart from changing the section, if nothing new has happened in the case, it would have been better if the police would have waited for the viscera report which is going to extinguish the type of poison and the amount of poison
 tab shashi tharur se poochtacha hoti to nai chijen saamne aa sakati thi
 In the case of Sunanda Pushkar's death, Shashi Tharoor successfully passed a marathon inquiry of about four hours
 lekin tharur ko apane sawaalon se gherne vaali special investigeshan team yani esaiti ke sutron kii maane to itani lambii poochtacha ke baavjood unhen tharur se kai aise sawaalon ke jawaab nahin mila, jo wo jaananaa chaahati thi
 According to sources, all ends of the questions were opening up around the relationship between Shashi Tharoor and Pakistani journalist Meher Tarar and the rift in mian-biwi over that relationship
 yani police maan kar chal rahi thi ki agar sunanda kaa katl hua he to phir is katl kii vajah shashi tharur or meher taraar ke rishte hi the
 But at the same time, the police was also looking at IPL by associating with this case, so the second important reason was in his eyes the IPL and money laundering
 chot kaa rajtherur ne ye to mana ki unke or sunanda ke bich ladaai hoti thi
 But he denied that he had a fight with Sunanda before his death
 jabaki hakeekat yahi he ki sunanda ke jism par chot ke ek nahin kul 15 nishaan maujuud the
 In such a situation, the question remained unresolved, where and how did Sunanda get so many injuries? The Rajpolis of the murder are arguably Sunanda's death as a case of murder, but Tharoor was still not ready to believe that anyone Must have murdered Sunanda
 police kaa sawaal tha ki kya maut se pehle sunanda ko kisi ne injection diya tha yaa kisi par tharur ko shaq he? jawaab main tharur kaa kahana tha ki unhen lagata he ki sunanda ek aam maut hi mari he
 According to the information revealed till now of sleeping pills, no doctor who treated Sunanda had advised him to eat sleeping pills
 iske baavjood sunanda kii maut ke baad hotel main unke kamare se alprex kii goliyon ke do khaali strip baraamad hue
 Tharoor could not give a clear answer as to where the strip came from in Sunanda's room
 meher kaa rajtherur ne ye mana kipakistani patrkaar meher tararase unke rishton ko lekar unki sunanda se anban hoti thi
 But refused to believe that he had a very close relationship with Tarar
 aise main jab police ne anban kii vajah poochi to tharur ne bataaya ki shaayad soshal media main donon ke active hone kii vajah se sunanda ko unhen lekar shaq hota hoga
 To hide the truth, Rajathur had said that in the first inquiry conducted by the SDM after Sunanda's death, there was no problem between him and Sunanda
 lekin baad main khud tharur ke naukar ne ye bataaya tha ki tharur or sunanda ke bich main aksar jhagade hote the
 In such a situation, when the SIT asked Tharoor the reason for hiding the truth in the reply given to the SDM, Tharoor could not give any clear answer
 shashi tharur ko jab pehali baar pataa chalaa ki sunanda kii maut ho chuki he to unhone sau number par phone karne kii bajaae sarojini nagar thane ke esechao ko phone karavaaya tha
 Police found this thing strange
 isi tarah police ko ye baat bhi ajeeb lagi ki jab maamle kii jaanch chal rahi he to tharur ames ke doctoron ke panel ko mail kyon kar rahe the?i-mail kaa rajtherur ne ames ke doctoron ko ek i-mail bhej kar sunanda ko lupas naam kii beemaari hone kii baat kahi thi
 Later, doctors told that Sunanda did not have any such disease
 tharur is silsile main puche gaye sawaal kaa bhi koi bahut saaf or santoshjanak jawaab nahin de sake
 Exit rajsit officials also asked him a number of questions regarding his being in the AICCC meeting during Sunanda's death
 masalan unhone vahaan kitna vakt bitaayaa, kab unhen sunanda kii tabiyat bigadane kii khabar mili, kab wo vahaan se ravaanaa hue
 And in response to these answers, the police also asked for some proof from them
 ipel kaa rajtherur se sunanda kii kisi se jaati dushmani, ipel yaa mani londring ko lekar hui koi sajeesh, sunanda kii press conference karne kii khabar hone yaa nahin hone, kerala se dilli aate vakt hawaii jahaaj main jhagada hone or ek hi hotel main pehle alag-alag kamaro main thaharne jaisi baton kaa sabab bhi poocha
 Rajit of not taking him to hospital, despite the news of Sunanda's deteriorating health, he tried to know from Tharoor about the reason for not taking him to the hospital and calling the doctor in the hotel itself
 saath hi ye bhi poocha ki aakhir wo intjaar kyon karte rahe?pisiar kol naa karne kaa raajpulice ne tharur se sunanda kii rahasyamai haalat main maut ho jane par bhi sau number par phone naa karne kii vajah poochi or ye bhi poocha ki aakhir unke staff ne police ko persenalee kol kyon kiya? tharur ne iske jawaab main bhi tab jo samaj main aayaa, vahi kiya jaisi baat kahi
 However, during questioning, Tharoor tried his best to appear calm and normal
 lekin is interogeshan ke baad philhal esaiti ne unhen naa to koi clin chit di he or naa hi unke sajeesh main shaamil hone kii taraf ishaara hi kiya he
 But yes, it has definitely made it clear that if needed, many more people can be questioned
 police ab sunanda pushkar ke katl kaa makasad or kaatil donon tak jald se jald pahunchnaa chaahati he
 But before reaching the real murderer, he also has to meet ten such people, who can prove helpful in revealing the murderer's address
 aakhir koun hai wo das chehre?shashi tharur - sunanda pushkar ke patishiv menon - sunanda kaa betashish das - sunanda kaa chota bhairajesh pushkar - sunanda kaa chota bhainarayan singh - sunanda or shashi kaa khaas naukarbajrangi - sunanda kaa driverrajesh kumaar sharma - shashi tharur ke pieshiv kumaar prasad - shashi tharur ke tatkaaleen oesdidoctor sanjay dewan - kep varde ganraajya ke counsal general or sunanda ke paariwarik mithranlini singh - varisht patrakaarye mahaj das naam nahin hai balki dilli police kii special investigeshan team ke liye ye das behad ahm kirdaar hai, kyonki sunanda pushkar kii hatya ke maamle main police kii tafteesh inhen das naamon ke ird gird hi tiki hui he
 One of his stated things is very important for the police, because under the guise of the same things, the police have to find the truth of Sunanda Pushkar, which can give the real address of his mysterious death
 haalanki police ne un logon ko bhi khangaalana shuru kar diya he, jin logon ke naam in logon kii baatcheet main saamne aa chuke hai
 In which Katy aka Catherine Abraham is the most important name, because the name mentioned in this statement by Sunanda and Shashi Tharoor's servant Narayan, many questions came to the police and they got answers without any questions

 agar aapako aisa lagata he ki aapaki garlfriend aapke saath ab zyada vakt nahin bitaati, phir bhi aapse'ofishili brake ap'karne se batch rahi he', to aapke liye ye alarming signal he
 Learn from these five signs whether your girlfriend is really using you? 1
 wo baar baar kahe, 'mujhe spes chahie'agar aapaki dost musiibat padane par aapako yaad kare to khud ko bhaagyashaalee samajhie
 Help him too lekin agar pareshaani se baahar aate hi wo aapako nazarandaaj karne lage, baatcheet kam kar de or aglaa shiddat bharaa kol tabhi aae jab use aapaki madad kii jarurat ho to maan lijie aap uske liye ek tishyu paper se zyada kuch nahin

 frends wyeth ectra benefits
 
 
 If the girl you love desperately hugs you in a public place, then don't forget to understand that she also loves you with the same passion
 ho saktaa he ki uske liye aap bas 'just friend ho'
 Consider whether he has ever shared his feeling about you with you? It may also be that she is giving you a chance to claim your rights according to your convenience
 3
 Ignore between friends
 a girl may not mention her boyfriend in front of the family in fear and terms, but how afraid of friends? So, if your girlfriend does not hesitate to introduce you to her friends or gets busy with friends by avoiding you at the party, then she is not comfortable with you
 bhalaai isi main he ki vakt rahete aap khud usase duuri bana len

 use 'benefit of dout' dena band karengar aapako aisa lag rahaa he ki koi ladki aapke kareeb hote hue bhi aapako puraa haq nahin de rahi he to sabase pehle ye pataa karen kahin wo aapke saath ribound dating to nahin kar rahi? ho saktaa he ki kisi se brake ap ke baad wo aapke kareeb ai ho or aapke saath vakt bitaana use acha lag rahaa ho
 If this is the case then there is every chance that she does not love you
 wo aapke kareeb isliye bhi ho sakati he kyonki wo khud ko kisi se dur rakhana chaahati he
 So stop convincing yourself that he is confused about the relationship with you
 yaad rakhie yaa to wo aapse pyaar karti he yaa pyaar nahin karti
 Confusion has no place between this two answers
 5
 She just says to herself, she does not listen to you
 Ever think with a calm heart, when was the last time your girlfriend sat with you and discouraged you? Is it not that when you needed him most emotionally, he was not around you
 agar aisa lagaataar kai baar hua he to vakt saavdhaan hone kaa he
 There is no alternative to trust in a relationship
 lekin agar do logon ke bich duuri badhane lage yaa koi kanfusion ho to aage badhane se pehle behatar hoga ki aap in paanch paimaanon par apane rishton kaa aankalan jarur kar len
