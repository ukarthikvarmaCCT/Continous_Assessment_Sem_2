 is list main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke amethi or raibareli se sonia gandhi ke naamon ke alaava jitin prasad or arpyen singh jaise kai diggajon ke naam shaamil hai
 The Congress has announced such names in the province, on which it seems more confident of winning
 mana ja rahaa he ki inamen wo siten bhi shaamil hai, jinhen congress akhilesh-mayawati ke saamne maang rahi he
 Congress candidates in the ongoing list of Congress candidates, Sonia Gandhi from Rae Bareli, Rahul Gandhi from Amethi, Nirmal Khatri from Faizabad, RPN Singh from Kushinagar, Salman Khurshid from Farrukhabad, Imran Masood from Saharanpur, Anu Tandon from Unnao, Jitin Prasad from Dhaurahra, Badayun Salim Sherwani, Rajaram Pal from Akbarpur and Brijlal Khabri from Jalaun will contest the Lok Sabha elections
 chunavi samikarancongress ne jin 11 naamon kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Currently, Congress has two of these seats
 jabaki kushinagar or saharanpur seat aisi hai jahaan par party duusare number par or baaki bachi 7 siton par congress tisare or chauthe number rahi thi
 However, in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the party won the remaining seats except Badaun, Jalaun and Saharanpur seats
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress ne sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke saamne raibareli or amethi ke alaava jin 13 siton kii demand rakhi thi
 Kushinagar, Dhaurahra, Saharanpur, Unnao, Akbarpur and Farurkhabad seats are believed to have been included among them
 inamen se chah siton main se teen siten basapa ke khate main hai or teen hi seat sapa ke khate main hai
 Congress's focus: After Priyanka Gandhi's entry into active politics, the Congress is focusing on about two dozen seats out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 inamen se guuruuvaar ko congress dwaara jari list main se 9 siten shaamil hai
 Here the Congress is entering the electoral arena with complete planning
 raajnneetik vishwalepanon kii maane to raibareli or amethi ke alaava congress jahaan sabase majboot maani ja rahi he
 Kushinagar, Dhaurahra, Unnao and Saharanpur seats are prominent among them
 haalanki sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke baad congress kaa siyaasi sameekaran kai siton par gadabada bhi rahaa he
 bsp-turned challenger BSP has already spoiled the political equation of Imran Masood of Congress by removing Haji Fazlur Rahman from Saharanpur seat
 fajalurrahman saharanpur ke meyar ke chunaav main mahaj 9 sau maton se bijepi ummidavaar se haar gaye the
 People of Saharanpur blame Imran Masood for this defeat of BSP candidate
 yahi vajah he ki imran masood jagah-jagah apni jansabhaon main safai de rahe hai
 Gulzar Ahmed, who hails from Saharanpur, says that due to Imran Masood, the Muslim candidate has lost from Saharanpur seat itself
 iske alaava ab ham log nahin chaahate hai ki hamaara saansad hindu-muslim ke bich nafrat paidaa karne vaala ho
 After the SP-BSP alliance, a large section of Saharanpur stands with the BSP
 arpyen or jitin se ummidempichley chunaav main kushinagar loksabhaa seat par duusare number par rahe arpyen singh par party ne phir daanv lagaaya he
 After being given the command of Purvanchal to Priyanka Gandhi, it is believed that rpns will give a tough fight to BJP
 jabaki dhaurhara seat se congress ne jitin prasad par ek baar phir bharosa jataayaa he
 It is believed that Jitin could not save his seat in the Modi wave in the last election, but this time he can give a very tough competition
 haalanki congress kii majboot siton main unnav seat bhi maani ja rahi he, jahaan se party ne annu tandon ko utaara he
 She won the 2009 Lok Sabha elections

 In the book of senior journalist Sheetla Singh, the claimant Sangh chief gave a strong scolding to Singhal
 The country's biggest and much awaited decision will come at 10
30 am on Saturday
 lekin, aazaadee ke baad se hi ayodhya masale par court main kisi na kisi tarah kaa cese chalata aa rahaa he
 But the case gained momentum when the demolition took place on 6 December 1992 at the disputed site
 uske baad se is maamle se jude pakshakaar apane-apane daawey karte rahe
 But very few people know that if in 1987, Vishwa Hindu Parishad General Secretary Ashok Singhal would not have been scolded by Balasaheb Deoras, the head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, then Babri Masjid would have been shifted from its place at that time
 is baat kaa zikr ayodhya ke varisht patrkaar sheetala singh kii kitaab ‘ayodhya - ramajnmabhumi-babari masjid kaa sach’ kiya he
 Sheetla Singh has also been the convenor of the Ayodhya Development Trust, which resolves the Ayodhya dispute
 saath hi faijabad (ab ayodhya) jile se nikalne vaale akhbaar janamorcha ke sampadak bhi hai
 Sheetla Singh's book mentions how Sangh chief Deoras became angry with VHP General Secretary Ashok Singhal on the Babri Masjid issue
 devaras ne singhl ko kadi daant pilaai thi
 Before the verdict on Ayodhya, UP alert, open petrol, acid sales, the book of Rokshitla Singh has written that Ashok Singhal was scolded because the Panchjanya and Organizer newspaper had appeared on 27 December 1987 that the Rambhaktas were conquered
 
 congress sarkaar mandir banane ke liye vivash ho gai he
 Trust has been created for this
 ise ram mandir andolan kii safalataa bataaya ja rahaa he
 At that time, a method was devised that the Babri Masjid was to be removed from its place without harming the foreign technology
 saath hi ram chabutare se ram mandir kaa nirmaan shuru karnaa tha
 Along with this news, a photo of VHP General Secretary Ashok Singhal was printed on Panchjanya's front page
 sheetala singh kii kitaab kaa pej number 110, jisamen sangh pramukh devaras or ashok singhl kii baatcheet kaa ansh he
 Let us know what is mentioned in the book of Sheetla Singh
 
 
 
 Sheetla Singh has mentioned the incident on page number 110 of his book
 unhone keem sugar mills ke maalik or prabandh sanchaalak lakshmikant jhunjhunwaala ke hawaale se is ghatana kii puri kahani likhi he
 Jhunjhunwala came to Sheetla Singh to collect some papers for Vishnuhari Dalmiya, senior VHP leader at that time
 kaagaj lekar dilli chale gaye
 When he came back from Delhi to Faizabad, he reported the incident involving Deoras and Singhal to Sheetla Singh
 lakshmikant jhunjhunwaala ne bataaya ki us din dilli main rashtriya swanyasevak sangh ke jhandevalaan sthit mukhyalay keshav sadan main ek baithak hui thi
 Union chief Balasaheb Deoras was also present in it
 unhone sabase pehle ashok singhl ko bulaayaa or poocha ki tum itane puraane swanyasevak ho, tumne is yojana kaa samarthan kaise kar diya?6 disambar 1992 hi nahin, aazaadee ke pehle bhi hua tha babari masjid par ataikasinghal ne kaha ki hamaara andolan to ramamandir ke liye hi tha
 If he accepts, then one must welcome
 is baat par devaras un par bifer pade or kaha ki tumhaari akl ghaas charne chali gai he
 There are 800 temples of Rama in this country, if another is built, it will be 801st
 lekin yah andolan janata ke bich lokapriy ho rahaa tha
 His support was growing, on the strength of which we would reach the position of forming a government in Delhi politically
 tumne iskaa swaagat karke vastav main andolan kii peeth par chura bhonka he
 This offer will not be accepted
 jab ashok singhl ne bataaya ki isamen to mandir andolan ke mahant aveddhanath, justise devakinandar agarwal sahit sthaneey or baahar ke kai netaa shaamil hai, to devaras ne singhl se kaha ki isse baahar niklo, kyonki yah hamaare uddeshyon kii purti main baadhak hoga
 Interestingly, it was not featured in any of the other media mediums of the country at that time, apart from the mouthpieces Organizer and Panchajanya of the Khak Sangh
 zaahir he, khabar ke strot vihip ke hi log the
 Mahant Nrityagopal Das was the chairman of this trust
 ram janmabhumi nyaas ke agua paramhans ramchandra das bhi isamen shaamil the
 These two were among the top leaders of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement run by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad
 narsingh raav agar ye kadam uthaate to batch sakati thi babari masjid, aakhir kya thi unki majaburimuslim netaa bhi taiyaar the masjid ko videshi takanic se hataane ke liye‘ayodhya - ram janmabhumi- babari masajid kaa sach’ pustak main likhaa he ki muslim netaa babari masjid ko maujuuda sthaan se aadhunik takanic ke dwaara bina tode ayodhya ke parikrama maarg par le jane ke liye taiyaar ho gaye the
 The work of removing the building in this manner had already been done in other countries
 dubai main ek aspataal nirmaan ke liye ek masjid ko duusare sthaan par khiskaaya gaya tha
 Muslim leaders also wrote letters to the ulema (scholars) of five major Muslim countries to obtain religious consent, out of which consent was reached from three
 is saare maamle kii jaankaree tatkaaleen grahamantri bootaa singh or uttar pradesh ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantriyon - pehle vir bahadur singh or phir narayan dutt tiwari - ko bhi thi
 Later, such reports in the RSS mouthpiece also contradicted Chhapadevaras and the VHP leaders lost their hands and feet
 pustak main is baat kaa zikr he ki devaras ne saaf kaha ki ve is yojana se apane haath khinch len
 The same thing happened after some time when the VHP leaders said that in this plan it is not decided where the sanctum sanctorum of the temple will be
 dilachasp yah he ki janvari 1988 main sangh ke mukhpatr main chapa ki sheetala singh vampanthi vichaar ke hai isliye in par bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It is written in the book that in this way all efforts were blocked
 kai baar log aisa mahasoos karte hai ki kaaphi parishram or praytn ke baad bhi dhan nahin miltaa yaa manachaahi safalataa nahin milti
 Sometimes you do not get money according to hard work, sometimes you do not get the desired job
 vyapaaree hai to vyapaar main barkat nahin he
 Even if you leave things out, despite everything, there is no mental peace
 paariwarik jivan main uthal-puthal machi hui he
 There is job instability or restlessness in mind, nervousness persists
 ho saktaa he ki aapako anaavashyak dar sataata ho
 But why so? To solve all kinds of problems, we are giving such measures, which will not only keep your heart calm, but will also open the doors of progress and remove the lack of money
 parivaar main phir se khushiyaan laut aaengi
 Find peace in fragrance: Aroma has great importance in life
 sugandh main bhi itr kii sugandh ho to kahana hi kya
 It is not necessary to use fragrance on body and clothes
 aap sugandh ke liye ghar main sugandhit paudhe bhi laga sakate hai
 By using the aroma of jaggery, ghee, googal and karpoor in the house, you will not only remove the Vastu defects in the house, as well as peace of mind will expand
 is niyam ko samajhen ki jahaan shanti hoti he, vahiin khushhaali hoti he
 For Barkat: Barkat comes from a clean intention, a clean body and a clean home
 man, sharir or ghar saaf-suthra or svachh rahegaa to ghar main barkat rahegi
 Donate for clean intention, take a bath and fast for a clean body, wipe with sea salt for a clean house, and leave the atala out of the house
 agar barkat chaahate hai to ye kaam karen
 
 
 Wiping: Wiping with sea salt once a week (except Thursday) brings peace to the house
 ghar kii sari nakaaratmak urja samaapt hokar ghar main jhagade bhi nahin hote hai tathaa lakshmi kaa vaas sthaayee rahata he
 'barkat' means that auspicious condition in which something or things are available in such a quantity that even after meeting the requirements from them, he remains still, that is, so much food that the guest along with the members of the house will eat it
 dhan itnaa ho ki aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke baavjood vah bachaa rahe
 The proper house is one whose direction is north, north, west or west
 yadi aisa nahin he to pratidin subah or shaam karpur jalaaen
 Keep a piece of Karpoor in the part of the house where there is Vastudosh
 us dali se sugandh nikalati rahegi or vah vahaan kaa vaataavaran badal degi
 Place the sleeping places of all the members of the house in the proper direction
 ghar main mor pankh rakhen
 Vastu defect is also removed from this
 mana jaataa he ki ghar ke dakshin-purvi kone main mor kaa pankh lagane se bhi ghar main barkat badhati he
 If the peacock feather is placed in the northwest corner of the house, there is no fear of poisonous animals
 apni jeb yaa diary main mor pankh rakhane par rahu dosha se mukti milti he
 Feed the animals and birds daily: Feed the first bread of the meal prepared in the house to the cow and the last bread to the dog with regular rules
 iske alaava pratidin pakshiyon or chintiyon ke liye bhojan-pani kii vyavastha karen
 Do not close this sequence
 43wein din se aapke bhagya ke dwaar khulanaa shuru ho jaaenge
 Feeding food daily to animals and birds has been considered the greatest virtue
 isamen bhi hindu dharm main gaay, coy, kute, cheentee or saanp ko anya pashu or pakshiyon kii apeksha adhik mahatv diya gaya he

 The Government of Jammu and Kashmir, whose formation is getting complicated
 siton se bhi zyada badi aadchan alag-alag vichaardhaara, or sharten hai, jo gathbandhan sarkaar ke gathan ke raste main rode ban gaye hai
 There is talk of BJP and National Conference forming a government, doors are open
 
 
 umr abdulla kii bijepi ke netaaon se dilli main mulaakaat kii khabaren bhi chhapin, lekin aadhikarik taur par kuch kaboolte nahin bana, kyoki vaapasi par srinagar main unhen kuch vidhayakon kaa virodh jhelana padaa
 
 
 BJP will get the benefit of being a big partner here
 
 
 shaam tak pidipi-bijepi ke gathbandhan kii charchaa tej ho gai, lekin bijepi yahaan chota partner hoga, or upar se rajnatik vichaardhaara ke kone se bhi is gathbandhan par javabdehi donon ke liye mushkilen khadi kar degi
 
 
 However, according to the data, this alliance will be strong
 
 
 28, 25 or kuch nirdaleey
 
 
 The Congress is saying that the PDP should come with it to form the government, not bow down to the BJP
 
 
 lekin yah ek kamjor gathbandhan hoga
 
 
 And the BJP will continue to be a strong challenge as a strong aggressive opposition, which can create a challenge from the Center in terms of financial and security for the state as well
 
 
 pidipi or neshnal conference ke saath aane kii baat umr abdulla ne enditivi par kahi thi, lekin isse donon kii ghati main alag vichaardhaara or raajnneeti kaa vajood mit jayega
 
 
 It is clear that it will take time to form a government in the state, and patience is needed, because even if a coalition is formed, what will be its consequences will be a big question
 
 
 philhal mukhyamantri kiskaa hoga, yah sawaal bhi bana hua he
 
 
 The alliance is also being decided by the CM chair
 
 
 udhar bijepi kah rahi he ki ham sabase bada dal hai, 31 vidhayakon ke saath, lekin use yah rajyapal ko likhit taur par dena hoga
 
 
 It is also to be seen whether the Governor calls PDP as the single largest party with 28 mlas or BJP
 
 
 ghatnakram jammu-kashmir main teji se badal rahaa he
 
 
 And it will be very interesting to see how and whose government is formed
 
 
 madhya pradesh main congress 15 saal se satta kaa vanvaas jhel rahi he
 Now she wants to get the power of the state again on the basis of Lord Rama
 yahi vajah he ki is baar congress ne 'ram van gaman path yatra' shuru kii he
 On the other hand, the public will assess the work of ruling BJP chief Shivraj Singh Chauhan and then decide whether Shivraj will become the Chief Minister for the fourth time

 While the BSP won 4 seats and others won 3 seats
 23 march 2007 bharat ke cricket itihaas kaa vah din tha, jab bharat kaa vishwacap jeetne kaa sapana buree tarah tut gaya tha
 At that time India, ranked 5th in the world, was eliminated in the first round
 is kamjor pradarshan se puure desh kaa dil dukhaa tha, lekin sabase zyada aansu us captain ke ankhon main the, jo isworld kapmen bharat ko lead kar rahaa tha
 That person is Rahul Dravid, known as 'the Wall' in the cricket world
 rahul dravid ke vah aansu aaj khushi ke aansu main badal gaye, jab unhone 10 saal baad bataur coach ek world cap bharat kii jholii main daal diya
 Also gave crores of Indians a chance to celebrate
 2007 kaa world cap bataur khilaadi rahul dravid kaa aakhri world cap bhi tha
 Rahul Dravid, who was part of three World Cups, his dream of being a part of the world winning team remained unfulfilled
 team india 2003 main final main pahunchi bhi thi, lekin use australia ke haathon buree haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Team India became a world champion in Dhoni's leadership in 2011 and the dream of Lord Sachin Tendulkar, who was in India's 'fab-4' with Rahul Dravid, was certainly fulfilled, but Dravid's dream remained incomplete
 rahul dravid 2011 ke worldcup kii team main shaamil nahin ho paae the
 It was probably the Karma of the match when Dravid announced the end of the innings 6 runs ahead of Sachin Tendulkar's double century
 haalanki is baar under 19 bhartiya team ne apane 'guru' rahul dravid ko vishwa cap jitkar shandaar tohfa diya he
 Prior to his coaching, the team was runner-up in Bangladesh two years ago
 team india kii diwaar kahe jane vaale purv diggaj ballebaaj rahul dravid ne bhartiya cricket ke bhavishya kii ek majboot buniyaad khadi kii he
 Standing on the same strong foundation, the under-19 Indian cricket team has created history
 team ne chauthi baar under-19 vishwa cap jitkar itihaas rach diya
 The team defeated Australia by 8 wickets in the final match
 bisisiai ne kisi or khilaadi kii bajaay in yuvaaon ko sikhaane kaa jimmaa rahul dravid ko diya tha
 It is proved by this decision that no former player faces Dravid in terms of technique
 test cricket main dravid kaa dhairya, vanade main unki aakraamakata kaa hi nateeja he ki under-19 team ne unase gur sikhkar ye khitaab apane naam kiya
 Dravid is the coach of 'mr Trustworthy' Rahul Dravid under-19 team as well as India 'A' team and recently BCCI extended Rahul Dravid's contract for two years
 sachin tendulkar, saurav ganguli or vivies lakshmana vaali is salaahkaar samiti ne coach ke taur par dravid ko upyukt mana
 Now after winning the World Cup, Sachin has again praised his former teammate
 under-19 vishp cap main bharat kii jeet par visphotak ballebaaj virendra sahvaag ne apane andaaj main dravid ko jeet par badhai dete hue twit kiya, 'ye yuva rahul dravid ke sabase surakshit haathon main he
 
 
 Apart from Sehwag, Congress President Rahul Gandhi, actor Amitabh Bachchan, President Ram Nath Kovind have also congratulated the team as well as Rahul Dravid on this victory

 But the main reason for the murder was that Pradeep wanted to make love affair with the wife of one of them
 arapy pradeep ko rewadi main ek shaadi main le gaye
 Killing him in the car and threw the dead body

 un reporton ke bare main puche jane par ki hajaare ne suraksha lene se inkaar kar diya he, police adhikari ne kaha, yah sahi nahin he ki unhone suraksha lene se inkaar kar diya he
 They told us that they do not need protection
 krishna prakaash ne kaha, unhone kaha ki vah kabhi kisi prakaar kii suraksha nahin chaahate the
 He loves meeting people and is in no danger
 unhone kaha ki iske purv hajaare kii suraksha main do log tainaat the

 varisht police adhikari ne kaha, jab kabhi hajaare apane gaanv ralegan siddhi se baahar jate hai, unke saath daste kaa ek vaahan bhi hoga
 Many Sangh and party leaders are ready to announce the name of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as the bjp's PM candidate, but the Advani camp has now put another complicated condition in front
 ek angreji akhbaar main chhapi khabar ke mutabik is kheme kaa kahana he ki agar modi ko rashtriya str par apni daavedaari pesh kerani he, to pehle unhen gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke pad se istipha dena hoga
 This camp is also advocating that the announcement of Modi's name be postponed
 unka tark he ki agar abhi naam kaa elaan kar diya gaya to is saal ke aakhri main chaar rajyon main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main sthaneey mudde gaun ho jaaenge or ye chunaav modi par janadesh main tabdeel ho jaaenge
 According to party sources, Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Murali Manohar Joshi are telling the Sangh leadership that it is not right to announce Modi's name in the current situation
 udhar sangh kah rahaa he ki jab tak saaf taur par naam kaa elaan nahin hota, tab tak party ke kuch netaa bayaan dekar beja vivaad khadey karte rahenge
 According to the announcement by September, Rajnath Singh, party president Rajnath Singh, union representatives Ram Lal and M
 Venkaiah Naidu are advocating that Narendra Modi's name should be announced as soon as possible
 rajnath singh kaa maananaa he ki bhale hi agast kii dedline puri na ho paa rahi ho, magar agle maheene tak to yah kaam ho hi janaa chahie
 He says that it would be better to do so after the monsoon session of Parliament
 sangh ne diya parampara kaa hawalamodi ke paksh main party ke sabhi netaaon ke bich sahmati banane main juta sangh netritv parampara kii duhai bhi de rahaa he
 It says that before every general election, BJP has told the people who will be its Prime Minister in the event of getting the mandate
 party hameshaa yah kaam congress ke pehle karti rahi he auki iskaa chunaav main phayda bhi mila he
 The Sangh believes that announcing Modi's name will give him a better chance and time to establish himself at the party forum in every corner of the country
 sanghathan ise apwaad ke taur par le rahaa he kyonki isse pehle is top post ke daavedaar chaahe vah atal rahe hon yaa adwani kabhi rajya kii raajnneeti main nahin simate
 In such a situation, he did not have to make extra efforts to claim at the national level
 adwani khemaa vidhansabha chunaavon par focus ke paksh menudhar modi kii daavedaari kii hawa nikaalane main juty team adwani kar rahi he ki loksabhaa chunaavon main abhi kuch samay baaki he
 Right now the leadership and the organization should pay full attention to the impending assembly elections
 gauratlab he ki is saal ke ant tak dilli, rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main chunaav hone hai
 Political pundits are saying that the ruling BJP in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh can make a hat-trick of victory
 vahiin dilli or rajasthan main bhi uski vaapasi ke asaar hai
 The anti-modi faction of the party believes that if the name is announced now, then the achievements of the BJP chief ministers and issues related to it will fade and Modi will become the main issue in the elections

 bihar endie main siem pad ko lekar bayaanbaji shuru ho gayi he
 bjp's MLC Sanjay Paswan has advised Nitish Kumar to do politics in Delhi
 isse pradesh kii raajnneeti garma gayi he
 Speaking to reporters on Monday at his residence, Dr

 'vahiin jadyu ke rashtriya pravaktaa sanjay singh ne kaha, 'hamen paswan ji se certificate lene kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Everyone knows the work of Nitish ji
 vah bihar kaa ek bada cheharaa hai
 This Modi model of Paswan ji was said in 2015
 'rashtriya janata dal bhi iske bich main aa gaya he
 RJD vice-president Shivanand Tiwari said, 'what Paswan has said is the matter of many people
 nitish kumaar ji ki kya sthiti he ye bilkul spasht ho gaya he
 ' is saal makar sankranti patang premiyon ke liye kuch khaas banane ja rahaa he
 Because this year, Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi is dominating the kites, even he has left behind Salman, Shah Rukh and Amirco in this matter
 is baar makar sankranti ke avasar par kuch patangen modi or baraak obama kii dosti ko lekar bhi bazaar main maujuud hai
 Significantly, PMM Narendra Modi himself is also fond of flying kites
 isliye is saal modi brands kii patange dhooma machaa rahi hai or filmi hastiyaan peeche chhot gai hai
 There are many kites at the shops of kites in Mughalsarai in UP, on which there is a picture of US President Barack Obama with Modi
 vahi kuch aisi bhi patangen bazaar main ai hai jin par modi ko mahanayake bataaya gaya he saath hi ye bhi likhaa he kii achche din aa gaye
 The popularity of the kites of Modi brand this year is that Salman, Shah Rukh and Aishwarya have also been left behind
 pichley saal salmaan, shahrukh or aishwarya kii patangen kaaphi biki thim lekin is baar kisi kaa jaadu chal nahin rahaa he
 This time Narendra Modi and Obama are in great demand
 sambhawatah ganatantr diwas par is saal baraak obama ke bharat aane kii vajah se yah charchaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 During the monsoon it becomes a little difficult to look professional and comfortable in the office
 par visheshgy kii in salaah ko maanakar aap monsoon main bhi stylish najar aa sakati hai
 Sheena Aggarwal, director of 'urbanista Image Consultancy', has given some similar tips in view of monsoon: - Use of bright colors: Beat the weather with blue, red and orange colored clothes during monsoon
 Can
 is mausam main safed kapade na pahanen
 When soaked in rain, it is seen through them and stains are easily found on them
 -patalun or skirt:lambii patalun na pahanen kyonki ve jaldi gandi hoti hai
 If you want, you can fold them from below, according to your convenience and environment
 is mausam ke hisaab se smart formal skirt badhiya hai
 -coats and jackets: You can wear western costumes with a raincoat coat or jacket
 -bhartiya paridhaan:agar aap monsoon ke dauraan paaramparik bhartiya paridhaan ko praathamikta detii hai to salwar or patiala kii bajaay short kurti ke saath laging yaa chudeedaar aajamaayen
 In this season, replace scarves with big scarves or stalls
 barish main aise print or rangon vaale kapade katai na pahanen, jo bhigane par rang choden
 -shoe-sandal: Do not wear leather shoes or sandals in this season as they get wet quickly and take a lot of time to dry
 jelly shoej, bina hill vaali chappal-juute or anya majboot, bina phisalane vaale footvier pahanen
 -makeup: Apply waterproof mascara and eye liner
 barish ke mausam main foundation kaa prayog na karen or agar lagaana zyada hi jaruri he, to halkaa lagaaein
 -ball: Moisture in the atmosphere during the monsoon can complicate your hair
 baalo kaa juda yaa chotii bananaa behatar hoga
 -denim: Forget denim in monsoon
 inhen sookhne main bahut vakt lagata he
 -shadow: Choose an umbrella that matches the clothes
 input: IANS CM Yogi Adityanath went to the trauma center of KGMU and met the victim of acid attack on the train
 kanoon vyavastha ko durust karne kaa daawa kar rahe nae siem ke samaksh pradesh kii lachar shashan vyavastha kaa yah jeeta jaagta udhaaharan he
 In January, the present SSP Manzil Saini and the then DM Satyendra Singh were assured of the safety of the victim who is battling between life and death in the hospital today
 iske baavjood peedita par saream tejaab se hamalaa hua
 After all, how long will the administration continue to give hollow assurances and women will keep offering them in Uttar Pradesh? After all, when will the accountability of the officers be fixed for the misbehavior with the victim? The officials had given the assurance of security, Chief Minister Yogis had arrived at the trauma center to meet the victim, he had already expressed his concern to the top officials of the administration many times
 Has been done darasal, janvari ke maheene main shiroj cafe main ek dhamkee bharaa khat mila
 It was written in this letter that this woman should be fired or asked to withdraw the case
 varanaa anjaam bahut bura hoga
 So bad that acid would run in his veins instead of blood
 shiroj cafe main kaam karti thi peeditapidita raibareli kii rahane vaali he or roji roti ke liye lakhanu ke shiroj cafe main kaam karti thi
 Here all the women who have been victimized by her acid work
 vah in sabake liye badi didi thi or pyaar se unako teddy ber bulaati thim
 She went to her house before Holi and was supposed to return to work on Friday, but that is what she feared
 saheliyon kaa ro-rokar bura haub uski saheliyon kaa ro-rokar bura haal ho rahaa he
 a friend Mala says, "today the acid was not thrown on the sister's mouth, but the acid fed them
 vah apni aawaaj bhi kho baithi hai
 Now we are broken
 ham sabake saath bhi aisa ho saktaa he
 "dia reads Roe while talking and says," i remember SSP and DM met us
 unhone khud hi aashwaasan diya tha ki didi kii jaan ko koi khatra nahin he
 He is safe and his family will soon be called here to Lucknow
 usko raibareli jane kii jarurat nahin hogi, lekin nateeja yah hua ki aaj peedita troma centre main jindagi or maut ke bich jujh rahi he
 "look at what happened when you look carefully at how the time line of this case has been intimidating and harassing this woman for many years
 - 2009 main rape hua, uske baad police ne nahin kii karrwai- phir peedita mahila ayog gai, jiske baad exiaar darj hui- phir peedita ke saath samuhik balaatkaar hua, police main phir maamla darj karavaaya- 2011 main phir hua tezaab hamalaa or phir lagaataar cese waapas lene kii dhamkee- iske baad naaballig beti ke saath rape karne kii mili dhamkee- 18 janvari 2017 ko mila tezaab hamale kii dhamkee kaa khat- tatkaaleen dm satyendra singh or esaspi manzil saini shiros cafe pahuche or yahaan par unhone peedita ko aashwaasan diya ki vah yahaan par bilkul surakshit he
 They will be provided with security personnel to protect them, but this did not happen - the day before Holi, the victim went to Rae Bareli's house for the daughter's examination - the final hearing was to be held in the local court of Rae Bareli
 desh main viklangon kaa sammaan hona chahie or unki barabari haq or darja milanaa chahie isliye khud piem narendra modi ne viklang kii jagah divyang shabd istemaal karne kii baat kahi
 But the central government department of the DDA appointed a disabled person first and then removed him from the post in just one hour citing his helplessness
 dow rishiraj bhaati beete 26 saal se dilli sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon main kaam kar rahe hai
 Worked 16 years in Public Relations Department of Delhi Transco
 haal hi main dilli vikaas praadhikaran ke diarector jansampark niyukt hue
 He took charge on 10 January and was removed from office within an hour as he is handicapped
 dow rishiraj bhaati ke mutabik '10 janvari ko dopaher ko maine jimmaa sambhala or ek ghante main hi mujhe kah diya gaya ki aap yahaan kaam nahin kar paaenge or aapako waapas janaa hoga kyonki aap viklang hai
 It is very humiliating, 'according to Rishiraj, no physical ability was written anywhere in the advertisement for this post
 rishiraj polio ke shikaar hai lekin saalon se apana kaam saamaanya taur par kar rahe hai
 The DDA wrote a letter to Delhi Transco stating, 'you are informed that the post of Director (public Relations) in DDA is by nature field work in which the officer has to be present at various sites of DDA, such as DDA Park, Subversion Site, Sports Complex, Bio Diversity Park, etc

 In which physical work is also done
 is pad ke saath judi jimmedaari ko dekhte hue shri rishiraj bhaati ko pareshaani ho sakati he or ye didie ke hit main bhi nahin hoga
 So Rishiraj Bhati is immediately being sent back to her previous department, Delhi Transco
 'tippaniyan When asked about this, the chairman of the DDA, that is, LG Anil Baijal and vice chairman Udayapratap Singh, did not say anything on this issue
 sawaal yah nahin ki dow rishiraj bhaati jansampark nideshak pad kii jimmedaari sanbhaalane ke laayak hai yaa nahin
 Director level officer has to do the job, not to do any physical hard work himself
 balki sawaal yah he ki niyukti ke baad is tarah se daleel dekar pad se hataanaa is shaks ke atmasamman ke saath khilwaad nahin he? kya didie jaise sarkari vibhaag main niyukti is tarah se hoti he ki pehle niyukti kar lee or baad main duusari baaten yaad ain? Dr
 Rishiraj Bhati has been working in different departments of Delhi Government for the past 26 years
 dilli transko ke jansampark vibhaag main 16 saal kaam kiya
 Recently appointed Director of Public Relations of Delhi Development Authority
 unhone 10 janvari ko jimmaa sambhala or ek ghante ke bheetar unako pad se hataa diya gaya kyonki ve viklang hai
 According to Dr
 Rishi Raj Bhati, 'I took charge on the afternoon of January 10 and within an hour i was told that you will not be able to work here and you have to go back because you are disabled
 yah bahut hi apamaanit karne jaisaa he' rishiraj ke mutabik is pad ke liye nikle vigyaapan main kahin bhi shaareerik kshamta vaali baat nahin likhi thi
 Rishi Raj is a victim of polio but has been doing his work normally for years
 didie ne dilli transko ko khat likhakar bataaya 'aapako suchit kiya jaataa he ki didie main diarector (jansampark) kaa pad swabhaavatah field work vaala hota he jisame adhikari ko didie kii vibhinn cites par maujuud hona hota he, jaise didie park, todphod vaali site, sports complex, baio diaversity park vagairah
 In which officer's duties are largely outside
 jisamen shaareerik kaam bhi hota he
 Given the responsibility associated with this post, Shri Rishiraj Bhati may face problems and it will not be in the interest of DDA either
 isliye rishiraj bhaati ko turant unke pichley vibhaag dilli transko main waapas bheja ja rahaa he
 Comments didie ke adhyaksh yani alji anil baijal or upaadhyaksh udaipratap singh se jab is bare main poocha gaya to unhone is masale par kuch nahin kaha
 The question is not whether Dr
 Rishiraj Bhati is qualified to hold the post of Director of Public Relations
 nideshak str ke adhikari kaa jimmaa kaam karwaanaa hota he, khud koi shaareerik mehnat karnaa nahin
 Rather, the question is that after the appointment, the removal from the post by reasoning in this way is not messing with this person's self-respect? Is an appointment in a government department like DDA done in such a way that it is first appointed and later remembered other things? dow rishiraj bhaati ke mutabik '10 janvari ko dopaher ko maine jimmaa sambhala or ek ghante main hi mujhe kah diya gaya ki aap yahaan kaam nahin kar paaenge or aapako waapas janaa hoga kyonki aap viklang hai

 The deployment of these women is also being planned in Kashmir
 ajtkako sena ke ucch sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik mahila javaanon kocashmiramen oparation main sahyog lene ke liye bhi istemaal kiya jayega
 Women soldiers will be able to pick up the burqa
 Wherever there is apprehension that a male terrorist is trying to escape by hiding under the burqa, then he will check this female military police and find out whether she is indeed a woman or a terrorist
 is
 sutron kaa kahana he ki ab takkashmiramen turant kiye jane vaale oparation main yahi pareshaani aati thi ki agar koi aatanki burka pahan kar bhaagane kaa prayaas karata tha to purush jawan uskaa burka nahin uthaa sakate the kyonki agar usamen koi mahila hoti to yah puure kashmir main ek samvedansheel maamla ban saktaa tha
 According to the plan of Army Chief General Bipin Rawat, after the deployment of women soldiers, the army hopes that in this type of operation, no terrorist will be able to escape hiding in the woman's burqa because if the woman also takes the burqa of another woman If you look at the face, it does not become a serious matter
 kashmir main yaa desh ke anya bhaagon main is tarah ke oparation main ab tak sena yaa to local police yaa siarpief kii mahila batalian kii carmiyon kii madad se is tarah kii checking checking kiya karti thi, lekin yah ummid he ki mahila carmikon ke aane ke baad ab sena turat-phurat main kiye jane vaale oparation main bhi inkaa upyog kar paaegi or yah bahut bade had tak madadgaar sabit hongi
 The biggest search operation has just begun in the camp of rapist Baba Gurmeet Ram Rahim, that the dera has started growing one secret from the other
 dere se police ko badi maatra main karansi note, laptop or duusari chizein to mili hi hai, oparation ke shuru se pehle khud dere ke akhbaar ne likhaa he ki vahaan kankal bhi mil sakate hai

 But do you know which Bollywood film had the colors of Holi actually spread on the screen? According to the media report, the first time the movie which had scenes of Holi was a 'woman'
 yah ek blike and white film thi
 The celebration of Holi was shown in it, but the real colors could not be seen
 50 ke dashak main ek or film 'aan' ai
 In this, the pair of Dilip Kumar and Nimmi were seen playing Holi while dancing and singing
 dilip kumaar kii technicler film 'aan' main hi sabase pehle darshakon ko holi ke asli rang parde par dekhne ko mili the
 At that time it was magical to see artists dancing and singing Holi songs with different colors

 By the way, Holi and his songs have always been in trend
 50 ke daur tak filmi duniya colorphul ho chuki thi
 Due to this, the glow of festivals like Holi was also seen on the silver screen
 dilip kumaar kii movie 'aan' ke baad filmi parde par holi ko filmaane kaa ek chalan shuru ho gaya tha
 After that, Holi scenes were coined in many famous films
 kai filmein holi kii vajah se hi yaad kii gayi
 Holi i Re Kanhai


 from the 1958 film Mother India is remembered as a classical Holi song
 is song ko holi partiyon main aksar bajaayaa jaataa he
 After Mother India, the song 'ja Re Hut Natkhat


' from the film Navrang was shot
 iske baad se filmon main holi sikvence daalane kaa yah silsilaa aaj tak chalaa aa rahaa he
 Before proposing to Sridevi, Boney Kapoor did these scenes and songs of Kamaholi were considered to be a guarantee of making the film a hit
 holi ke gane popular hone lage

 aisa lagane laga maano, cinema or holi ke bich cholii-daaman kaa saath ho
 Both preparations and shopping for Diwali have started
 log apane liye or apane priyajanon ke liye bhi kharidari kar rahe hai
 Shopping for yourself will be on the day of Dhanteras
 ab sawaal he ki us din kya kharida jaae? is samay bazaar main bahut vikalp hai or ye aapke liye pareshaani kaa sabab he
 Because the more the confusions, the more
 aaj bhi dhanteras par sona or chaandi khareednaa na keval shubh mana jaataa he balki yah aarthik drushti se samajhadaari bharaa faisla bhi he
 Buying utensils may be your requirement and home appliances will increase your efficiency
 par sone-chaandi kii baat hi alag he
 There is something special in them and hence they are bought on Dhanteras for centuries
 darasal ye donon dhaatu na keval beshkeemtee hai balki inkaa security parpus bhi he
 That is, they are the biggest companions of bad times
 sona to khaas taur se isi uddeshy se kharida jaataa he or jab pichley dinon sari duniya ek mandi se jujh rahi thi to iske daam badhate ja rahe the
 People in all countries were buying it because they were troubled by the fear of an uncertain future
 ab is dhanteras main khushi kii baat yah he ki sona or chaandi donon kii keemten kaaphi gir chuki hai
 Both gold and silver have come well below their maximum
 yah aapke liye phaayde kaa sauda he
 In the capital Delhi, the gold standard is currently falling to Rs 27,400 per ten grams, while silver has reached very low at Rs 38,800 per kg
 in donon main bhi abhi satorie sakriy nahin hai or yah acchhee baat he kyonki jab ve sakriy honge to sone-chaandi kii keemten badhengi
 At the time of buying gold and silver, a question arises as to whether coins should be purchased
 agar aap sikke kharid rahe hai to aisi jagah se len jahaan us par muhar lagati ho yaa pakki raseed milti ho jaise sarkari sanstha mmatisi yaa bank
 There is no possibility of cheating by buying from them and you will get resale value

 Judge ML Tahiliani ordered the dismissal of Kazmi after Kazmi refused to accept the court's suggestion
 adaalat ne kazmi ko kul 340 gavaahon main se 71 ko gavaah chunane kaa suzav diya tha
 These include doctors treating the victims, post-mortem medical staff who performed the panchnama, forensic evidence in laboratories and relatives of the victims who claimed the bodies

 The judge said, "kazmi is not cooperating with the court in the interest of justice
 vah sunwaayee ko kheenchna chaahate hai or anaavashyak adaalat ke samay ko jaaya kar rahe hai
 The judge said indignantly, "it seems that the feeling in Azmi has gone home that he has become indispensable and he cannot be heard without him
" unako aisa lagata he ki unke bina adaalat asahaay he
 "it is a bad sign for everyone and the time has come for either Kazmi to recuse himself from the case or the court rejects his appointment," the judge said

 Prosecutor Nikam had informed the judge that he wanted to file an affidavit of 340 formal witnesses and 233 such documents had been submitted to the defense counsel
 nikam ne kaha tha ki adaalat kaa samay bachaane ke liye vah gavaahon ko vyaktigat taur par nahin bulaanaa chaahate
 When the judge asked Kazmi if he wanted to cross-examine these witnesses, Kazmi said that he would disclose his strategy only after Nikam filed an affidavit in the court
 nikam ne kaha ki unhone aath may ko apane pehle sambodhan main adaalat ko suchit kar diya tha ki vah aisa shapath patr daayar kar sakate hai
 Kazmi, however, objected to Nikam's claim and said that in his first address he had not made any disclosure that the judge had to say that he was lying

 The devastating waves have arisen and at the center of this storm is the Supreme Court's decision on 2G spectrum on 2 February
 janvari, 2008 main purv sanchaar mantri e
 The Supreme Court's decision to cancel 122 licenses distributed in a controversial manner by Raja has put a major stain on the UPA cabinet, especially its top leadership
 vipaksh ne sarkaar par 2ji ghotaale main lipt hone kaa aarope lagaate hue usase istipha maangana shuru kar diya he
 So far, the government has made Raja the scapegoat, but the latest decision widens the scope of crime
 8 farvari 2012: tasveeron main india todayah faisla 70 arab dollar ke kaarobaar or 85 karod upabhoktaaon vaale us doorsanchaar udyog ke liye milajula asar lekar aayaa he jise is desh main samaveshi vikaas kaa netritv karnaa tha, lekin bich main hi kharaab sarkari nitiyon ne adnga daal diya
 Companies such as Uninor and Swan, which entered this business in 2008, will have an impact
 unke license radd kar die gaye hai
 It may be that other big players will benefit at their cost, but overall this entire industry should breathe a sigh of relief
 adaalat ne jo dishanirdesh jari kiye hai, unke mutabik nikat bhavishya main sarkari niti, kaamkaaji faislon or nijee kshetra ke bich ke rishton par asar padana lajimi he
 The order canceling the license is based on the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution and the law, and violations of both the king
 - adaalat ne kaha he ki 'pehle aao, pehle paao' kii niti samvidhan main samanta ke siddhant ke khilaaf he kyonki yah un logon ko pakshpatpurna tareeke se phayda pahunchaati he jinaki sarkaar tak pahunch he
 Since this policy had solid support from the UPA government, the court's decision puts the entire government in the dock
 1 farvari 2012: tasveeron main india today- adaalat ne apane faisle main kaha he ki kaise raja ne bhartiya doorsanchaar niamak praadhikaran (tri) kii siforeeshon ko agast, 2007 main doorsanchaar ayog ke samaksh andekha kiya jisamen vitt sachiv bhi shaamil the
 P
 chidambaram ke netritv vaala vitt mantralay shuru main 'pehle aao, pehle paao' kii niti ke khilaaf tha lekin janvari, 2008 main jab license aavantit kiye gaye tab usne palati maar lee
 - The Supreme Court has also accused Raja of not accepting the Law Ministry's suggestion that the matter of evaluation of spectrum be referred to a privileged group of ministers
 court kaa yah bhi kahana he ki pradhanmantri ne 'pehle aao, pehle paao' kii niti par phir se vichaar karne kaa suzav diya tha jise raja ne khaarij kar diya
 The court also lashed out at Raja for his capricious decision to reschedule the date of allotment of license and set it back six days earlier, which gave some companies a peculiar advantage
 - court ke mutabik jin companiyon ne 2004 or 2006 main aavedan kiye the, unhen praathamikta suchi main neeche khiskaa diya gaya jabaki 2007 main aavedan karne vaali companiyon ko tarjeeh di gai or yah sab raja ke kehane par hua
 25 January 2012: See photos in India Today
 All were aware of the violations and were raised in the media and even in Parliament during the last three months of 2007 and the early quarter of 2008
 tatkaaleen vitt mantri chidambaram or pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne sab kuch jaanate hue bhi aavanton rokane kii koi koshish nahin kii
 After this decision, they no longer have a place to hide their mouths
 khaskar chidambaram to tri kanoon ke tahat raja ko kanoon kaa yah ulanghan karne se rokane ke adhikari the
 As the custodian of the treasury, Chidambaram had enough powers to disagree with the king's policy and recommend the matter to the cabinet
 par unhone aisa kuch bhi nahin kiya
 Keep in mind that the Supreme Court has not declared Chidambaram completely clean
 isaki bajaae usne yah faisla trial jaj o
 P
 saini ke haath main chhod diya ki ve tay karen ki 2ji maamle main unhen sah-aaropee banaaya jaae athwa nahin
 All eyes are now on Saini, who has to deliver a verdict on Chidambaram within two weeks as per the Supreme Court order
 ho saktaa he ki ve apana faisla 4 farvari ko suna den
 a week is a long time in politics
 or yah haftaa chidambaram kii jindagi kaa sabase lanbaa haftaa ho saktaa he
 January 18, 2012: See in pictures, Supreme Court's order to the government to auction the 122 licenses of India Today within a period of four months is no less than a scandal for incumbent Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal and Law Minister Salman Khurshid who took UPA The government has consistently argued in defense that the UPA policy of auctioning 2G spectrum was not
 unke mutabik, iklauta ulanghan 'pehle aao, pehle paao' kii niti ke kriyanvayan main hua he or sheersh adaalat ne saaf shabdon main jor dete hue is daleel ko khaarij kar diya he
 Sibal, now infamous for his 'zero loss theory', had argued that there was no loss to the exchequer when spectrum allocation was made in 2008 at 2001 prices
 ek baar 122 licenson kii nilaamee prakriya puri ho jane par is hawaii daleel kii hawa nikal jaaegi
 The court should be thanked that after this decision the government will make up for its losses and the benefit it will get will not be modest
 3ji kii nilaamee se sarkaar ko 1 lakh karod ru
 Had met iske mukaable raja ke spectrum lutaaney se sarkaar kii jheli main mahaj 9,000 karod ru
 Had come 11 janvari 2012: tasveeron main dekhen india todesupreme court ke faisle ke turant baad aarthik maamalon kii cabinet samiti or nivesh par cabinet samiti kii baithak hui, jiske baad sibbal ne press conference kar ke sara dosha raja ke sir madhnaa chaha, ‘nitigat masale par supreme court ne kaha he ki (pehle aao, pehle paao) niti bhedbhaavpurn he
 This policy is a legacy of the then NDA government
 ’ magar sibbal jis sawaal kaa jawaab nahin dete hai, vah yah he ki upie sarkaar endie kii viraasat ko dhone ke liye majaboor kyon thi
 After all, it is not that the decisions of the cabinet of previous governments are any stonewalling
 unhen anupyukt paae jane par akasar palat bhi diya jaataa he
 The CBI, which is investigating the 2G case, has also been directly targeted by the Supreme Court
 bhale hi adaalat ne adhivaktaa prashanth bhushan kii ore se 2ji maamle kii jaanch kii nigaraanee vishesh jaanch dal (esaity) ko saunpe jane sambandhi lagaai gai yachika thukraa di, lekin usne sibiai ko nirdesh diya ki vah niyamit taur par apni jaanch ke nishkarshon par kendriya satarkta ayukta (sivisi) ko report kare jo ise court ke saamne rakhega
 04 January 2012: See India Today in the photos, an additional watch will be kept on the CBI investigation
 dhyaan rahe ki ek anya maamle main sibiai kii aniyamitata ujagar ho chuki he
 The Supreme Court charged Unitech, Swan and Tata Teleservices for violating the merger and acquisition standards of Rs 5 crore
 prayek par jurmaana lagaaya tha
 These companies sold their stake to foreign investors soon after the license was granted and did not even wait for the mandatory minimum period
 dilachasp baat yah he ki sibiai ne 2ji maamle main tata ko chhodkar sirf do companiyon ko doshi tehraaya he
 According to the court, the three companies are equally guilty of the violation, but in the eyes of the CBI this is not so
within hours of the judgment of the mananeey adaalat ke faisle ke kuch hi ghanton ke bheetar bhaajapa kaa kendriya netritv uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaavon main iskaa laabh uthaane ke tareekon par charchaa karata dikhaa
 There could not have been a better time for the opposition to decide

 He said, 'the Finance Minister is the guardian of the treasury
 yah vitt mantri kii buniyadi jimmedaari he ki vah sunishchit kare ki janata ke paise kii lut na ho
 "he said that even though it was the decision of the government," the Minister of Communications and Finance Minister had a special role in it
 ’ or uttar pradesh main chunaav prachaar kar rahe rahul gandhi ke liye supreme court ke is faisle se bura kuch nahin ho saktaa kyonki congress kaa bhrashtachar ek baar phir bahes ke centre main aa gaya he
 It is possible that this decision will change the picture of the election campaign in India's largest state
 28 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india todecourt ke faisle kii sabase zyada maar un videshi niveshkon par padegi jinhone license aavanton ke baad bhartiya telecom companiyon main paisa lagaaya tha, kyonki ab ye license radd kar die gaye hai
 Uninor, a joint venture formed by Norway-based Telenor's investment in Unitech's telecommunications company, responded immediately to the case
 unitech main 6,000 karod ru
 a statement issued by Uninor, which bought 67 per cent stake at the price of Rs
 
 ham yah jaanakar jhatka laga he ki jis sarkari prakriya ko adaalat ne doshi paaya he, uski keemat uninor ko chukaani pad rahi he
 Rajiv Chandrasekhar, former telecom entrepreneur and MP, says, "investors who may have invested with confidence are now disappointed and worried
" videshi niveshak to yah sochakar aae the ki sarkaar ne ek baar license de diya he to sab thik hi hoga
 'though Chandrasekhar believes that to a certain extent he is also guilty,' he should ask himself whether he had conducted a thorough investigation before making the deal
 ’ chandrashekhar kaa maananaa he ki uninor or anya companiyaan kanoonee raahat ke liye court kaa darwaja khatkhataayengi
 He says, 'companies can sue the government
 ’ yadi radd kiye gaye 122 licenson kii dharak companiyon ne yachika lagaai, to yah prakriya kaaphi jatil hogi or licenson kii us nilaamee kii prakriya main deree ho sakati he jise chaar maheenon main nibataya janaa he
 Dec 21, 2011: See in pictures India todaysupreme Court verdict will have huge impact on companies that first came into telecom in 2008 - Uninor (22 licenses), swan-etisalat (15 licenses) and Shyam Sistema (21 licenses)
 yadi aagaamee nilaamee main ve kaamyaab nahin raheen to ve kaarobaar se puri tarah baahar ho jaaengi
 Telecom major Bharti Airtel was not licensed in 2008, so its health will not be affected
 duusare number kii vodaphone bhi beasar rahegi
 Reliance Communications, which got the license in 2001, is also unaffected by the decision
 haalanki teesri sabase badi oparator idia ke nau simit license radd ho gaye hai
 This company may spend huge money in the upcoming auction
 bade khilaadi bhi radd hue 122 licenson main se kuch ko khuli nilaamee main kharidne kii sthiti main honge or apana bazaar majboot kar sakenge
 One danger of this, however, is that if some companies exit the telecom business, competition will be reduced and the remaining companies will be able to arbitrarily increase prices, which consumers will have to pay
 chandrashekhar kehete hai, ‘yah ek ashanka he, lekin niamak ko is disha main dhyaan dena hoga ki keemten na badhane paaen kyonki pratispardhaa ghat gai he
 However, there is no immediate concern for consumers
 jin operataron ke license radd hue hai, unhen nilaamee tak apni sevaayen dene kii chhot hogi

 The Supreme Court accepted the Gujarat government's appeal for consideration in which the state government challenged the Governor's decision to appoint Justice (retd) RA Mehta as 'one-sided' to the post of Lokayukta
 nyaayamurti bi es chouhan or nyaayamurti je es khehar kii peeth ne kaha ki vah is maamle kaa vistaar se adhyayan karegi kyonki isse sanvaidhanik kanoon kaa ahm sawaal judaa he
 The bench said that it would hear the case for three days from February 20
 gujarat ucch nyaayalay ne apane aadesh main nyaayamurti mehta kii lokayukta ke pad par niyukti ko barkaraar rakhaa tha
 This order has been challenged by the state government in the Supreme Court, saying that the appointment is unconstitutional and has been done without its consent
 gujarat ucch nyaayalay ne 18 janvari ke apane faisle main nyaayamurti mehta kii lokayukta ke pad par niyukti ko barkaraar rakhaa tha or mukhyamantri narendra modi kii unke ‘kadamon’ ke liye tikhi aalochana kii thi jinaki vajah se ‘maamuli sanvaidhanik sankat’ utpann hua tha
 In a petition filed on January 19, the state government sought a stay on the High Court's decision and the order of Governor Kamala Beniwal on August 25, 2011, through which a letter of authority was issued to appoint Justice Mehta to the post of Lokayukta
 
 adhivaktaa mahesh agarwal ke madhyam se daakhil yachika main gujarat sarkaar ne kaha he ki kanoon ke sawaal uthe hai jinamein rajyapal dwaara lokayukta kii niyukti kiye jane par mantriparishad kii salaah kaa na hona bhi shaamil he
 It also objected to the use of 'strong reaction and language' by the High Court against the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 baharhaal, ucch nyaayalay ke faisle ko chunauti dete hue rajya sarkaar ne kaha he, ‘rajyapal ko gujarat lokayukta adhinium 1986 kii dhara teen ke tahat mukhyamantri kii adhyakshata main mantriparishad kii salaah or sahaayta par kaam karnaa tha
 It further states that no advice of the Council of Ministers was taken for appointment in the present case and it cannot be said to be constitutionally appropriate
 rajya sarkaar ne kaha tha ki mantriparishad kii salaah or sahaayta ke bina lokayukta ke taur par nyaayamurti mehta kii niyukti ke liye adhikaar patr (warrant) jari nahin kiya ja saktaa tha or vah bhi rajyapal dwaara
 The state government had said that the Governor had unilaterally issued a letter of authority for appointment of Lokayukta at his discretion which was 'undesirable'
 ucch nyaayalay ne rajya sarkaar kaa aagrah khandit faisla dene ke teen maah baad khaarij kar diya tha
 Justice VM Sahai of the Gujarat High Court, delivering the verdict as the third judge, said that the Chief Minister's actions on the Lokayukta issue showed 'erosion of our democracy'
 gujarat ucch nyaayalay ne kaha ki nyaayamurti mehta kaa naam khaarij karne kaa koi uchit kaaran nahin he
 Once the Chief Justice overruled the Chief Minister's objections
 gujarat ucch nyaayalay ke mukhya nyaayadhish ne mukhyamantri ko nyaayamurti mehta kii lokayukta pad par niyukti sweekaar karne kii salaah di thi
 This was rejected by the Chief Minister, which Justice Sahai termed as 'spiteful and challenging'
 modi nyaayamurti je aar vora ko lokayukta ke pad par niyukt karne par jor de rahe the lekin ise gujarat ucch nyaayalay ke mukhya nyaayadhish ne is aadhaar par sweekaar nahin kiya ki unhen gujarat rajya nyaayik academy kaa nideshak niyukt kiya gaya tha
 On 25 August last year, the Governor of Gujarat appointed Justice Mehta to the post of Lokayukta
 yah pad beete aath saal se rikt padaa tha
 The next day the state government challenged the appointment in the High Court, saying that the Governor had ignored it
 modi kaa tark tha ki rajyapal ne rajya sarkaar se mashwara kiye bina lokayukta kii niyukti kar di jo asanvaidhanik he
 On October 11 last year, a High Court bench gave a split verdict on the issue of appointment
 ek jaj ne jahaan rajyapal ke faisle ko barkaraar rakhaa tha vahiin duusare jaj ne niyukti ke sambandh main rajyapal dwaara jari adhikaar patr ko khaarij kar diya tha
 The matter was then referred to Justice Sahay

 Let us know what problems are there in the marital life of women according to the zodiac sign
 
 
 
 Aries - In the marital life of women of this zodiac, mainly in-laws relationships give problems
 usame bhi nanadon ke saath ke rishte samasya kaa kaaran banate hai
 The tendency of the husband to get drunk is also a problem
 is samasya ko samaapt karne ke liye roj praatah shiv ji ko jal arpit karen
 Taurus - Taurus mainly affects the mental sensitivity of women in their lives
 unke vaivaahik jivan main unke maayke paksh ke log samasya dete hai
 It is also a big problem for them not to get time for their husband
 To solve this problem, offer red flowers to Hanuman ji every morning
 shani chalenge ulti chaal, kiske liye shubh, kise milegaa kashtamithun raashi-mithun raashi kii mahilaon ke jivan main sasuraal paksh se samasya hoti he,inkaa talmail apane devar or devraani se nahin banataaisi kaaran se unke vaivaahik jivan main samasya hoti rahati he
 Add turmeric to the sun every morning and the water will disappear
 kark raashi -ye bahut samvedansheel hoti hai atah inako alag alag samay alag alag rishte pareshaan karte hai
 Often women outside their marital life or sometimes their own sister-in-law cause problems
 is samasya ko dur karne ke liye nity siankal tulsi ke neeche ghi kaa deepak jalaana chahie
 Leo rashi-singh Rashi's women in law often cause problems in their lives
 bahu or saas ke bich prabhutv ko lekar vivaad hote hai or ye vaivaahik jivan ko karaab kar dete hai
 To avoid this, they should be watered in peepal tree on Saturday

 Their own parents cause problems in marital life
 isse bachane ke liye inako mangalvaar ko hanuman ji kaa darshan karnaa chahie
 Scorpio zodiac - His elder brother-in-law or brother-in-law Devrani often creates obstacles in his life
 inke saath talmail karaab hota he or paariwarik vibhaajan kii naubat aa jaati he
 To avoid this, they should donate curd every Friday and also avoid dark colored clothes
 dhanu raashi-inke jivan main do chijen vaivaahik jivan ko karaab karti hai - ek unka krodh or doosraa unki nanad
 Together, the two factors make the case very bad from the beginning
 aisi dasha main is raashi kii mahilaon ko surya ko jal dena chahiesath hi hari vastuon kaa daan karnaa chahie
 Relationships for capricorn-capricorn zodiac women generally do not give problems, they are difficult to be too materialistic and lean more towards career
 thodaa sa rishton par dhyaan den or apane behtareen dimag kaa prayog kareninko bhagwaan shiv ko nity praatah jal arpit karnaa chahie
 Aquarius - For this, her husband's friend and husband's brother cause problems
 inke saath pati kaa jarurat se zyada samay dena samasya kaa kaaran banataa he
 To overcome this problem, they should donate sweet items every Sunday
 min raashi-min raashi kii mahilaayein aam taur par vaivaahik jivan main gambhir nahin hotisath hi unka talmail apni saas se bilkul nahin hota atah roj roj ghar main klesh hota he
 To get rid of this problem, he should offer vermilion to Mother Durga in the morning

 sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke tahat kai siten ke sapa ke khate main gai hai, un siton ke basapa netaa congress me shaamil ho rahe hai
 The SP leaders of such seats which have gone to the BSP account are turning to the Congress to save their political existence
 fatehpur loksabhaa seat se sapa ke purv saansad rakesh sachaan taiyaari kar rahe the, lekin gathbandhan ke seat shering ke tahat ye seat basap ke khate main chali gai he
 In such a situation, Rakesh Sachan has joined the Congress to preserve his political existence
 aise hi sitapur se basapa kii purv saansad kaisar chunavi ladane kii puri taiyaari kar rahi thim, lekin mayawati ne is seat se nakul doobe ko pratyaashee bana diya he
 Wherever Kaiser has joined Congress
 iske alaava baharich surakshit seat se bijepi kii baagi saansad savitri bai foole ne bhi congress kaa tham liya he
 If sources are to be believed, this is the reason why the SP-BSP alliance is trying hard to make the Congress a part as well
 lekin raajnneetik mizaaj ko samajhate hue congress sapa-sapa ke ofer par nahin balki apni sharton par gathbandhan kaa hissaa bananaa chaahati he
 SP-BSP has offered 9 seats to Congress out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, but now the party has increased the demand for seats
 soobe main sapa-basapa or congress ke bich seat shering kaa nayaa formula tay ho or teenon partiyaan baraabar siton par chunavi maidan main utren
 Congress is demanding 25 seats instead of 9
 darasal, congress netaaon kaa tark he ki 2014 ke chunaav main congress ko 2 siten mili thi
 While the BSP has not got a single seat
 is aadhaar par agar seat shering hoti he to bhi congress ko basapa ke kam siten nahin milanaa chahie
 At the same time, if seat sharing is done on the basis of the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, then the Congress should also get at least 25 seats
 haalanki congress ke is demand par sapa-basapa sahamat nahin hai
 Please tell that after Priyanka Gandhi has been given the command of Purvanchal, there is a new enthusiasm in the Congress
 priyanka gandhi ne congress ke puraane diggajon ko dobaaraa se party main waapas laane kii pahal kii he
 Apart from this, the Congress is also engaged in working out caste equations
 sapa kaa paramparaagat muslim vot bank bhi priyanka ke chalate congress kii ore jhukaav teji se dikhaai de rahaa he
 Congress is expecting the results like 2009 from UP
 dilachasp baat ye he ki 2009 main congress or sapa ke bich gathbandhan kii baat chali thi, lekin mulaayam singh yadav 12 se 15 siton hi dena chaahate he
 While the Congress was seeking 20 to 25 seats
 aise main donon partiyon ke bich gathbandhan nahin ho sakaa
 After this the Lok Sabha elections were held and the Congress stood at number one after winning 22 seats in the state
 khaas baat ye rahi he ki inamen zyaadaatar siten purvanchal se jeet mili thi
 In such a situation, Congress once again wants to make a tremendous comeback in this area through Priyanka Gandhi
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye upi main sapa-basapa ne gathbandhan he
 Of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, SP will contest 37 seats and BSP will contest 38 seats
 iske alaava ajit singh kii party rashtriya lokdal (RLD) ke liye 3 siten chodi hai
 While the coalition against the Congress in Amethi and Rae Bareli has decided not to field candidates

 But this film does not match the caliber of both
 donon hi kairactor artist yani unhen koi alag hatakar kairactor diya jaae to ve use screen par bakhubi jinda karne kii kuwvat rakhte hai
 But here they have nothing to show Jauhar
 jaise milkha main farhaan ke paas body or daudane ke liye kaaphi jagah thi or vidya ke paas kahani main dikhaane ke liye kairactor or da darty pikchar main antertenment, antertenment or antertenment tha
 Both do not get such an opportunity in it
 vidya ko apni figure par khaas dhyaan dena hoga
 They are not available on many occasions
 haalanki unki acting acchhee rahi he
 Farhan is also fine

 The film is also made keeping in mind the female audience

 The Monsoon Session of Parliament is quite important this time because in addition to the passage of important Bills, the post of Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha is also to be elected in this session
 upasabhapati ke taur par congress netaa pije courian kaa kaarykaal samaapt ho chukaa he
 In such a situation, this election is considered to be very important because this post has been with the Congress for 41 years, but this time no non-congressman can handle this post
 endie kii ore se akali netaa naresh gujral ko is pad ke liye utaara ja saktaa he vahiin vipakshi kheme main ummidavaar ke naam par ek raay nahin ban saki he

 tiemasi upasabhapati ke liye varisht saansad sukhendu shekhar raay ko maidan main utaar sakati he lekin vipakshi dalon ke sahyog ke bagaiyr tiemasi kii jeet mumkin nahin he
 TMC has 16 mps in Rajya Sabha, so touching the magic figure of 123 to win is not a matter of party's bus
 ab tiemasi kii najrancongress ke pantaraper hai kyonki vipakshi dalon main congress sabase badi party he or uske paas 50 saansad hai
 On the other hand, if the Congress raises its candidate, it will buy the resentment of the opposition parties
 majboot he endie khemaamodi virdohi kheme ko agar jeetna he to 16 vipakshi dalon kaa ek saath hona jaruri he
 The BJP is the largest party in the Rajya Sabha with 69 members and the figure comes close to 108, including the NDA
 is endie main shivasena (3) or manonith sadsy (3) bhi shaamil hai agar vah chhitakate hai to endie ummidavaar kii jeet bhi mushkil ho sakati he

 lekin sansad main bijepi ko haraane ke liye sabhi dalon kaa saath aana jaruri he
 With the coming of only 2 or 3 parties, the strong group of NDA cannot be defeated

 For this major exercise he may have to compromise for the post of Deputy Chairman within Parliament
 haalanki is pad par 4 dashakon se congress kaa kabja rahaa he lekin agar vah sadan ke bheetar tiemasi ko saport nahin karti he to sansad ke baahar vipakshi dalon ko ek manch par laane kii koshishon ko jhatka lag saktaa he
 Apart from this, parties like TDP and TRS standing with TMC may also face joint opposition

 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi unase kaaphi junior hai or unke saath kaam karne kaa anubhav unhen nahin he
 On the one hand, Mamata Banerjee, the Congress's staunch opponent in West Bengal, is ready to join the Congress at the Center, on the other hand, if the Congress does not support her party in the Rajya Sabha, it will not send a good message to the opposition camp

 According to sources, TMC has spoken to Congress leader Ahmed Patel for support in the election and there are also indications that the Congress may support a non-bjp candidate

 Honeypreet had now become the closest to Gurmeet
 gurmeet us par itnaa meharbaan tha ki use kabhi dere se baahar nahin jane diya
 His studies were written in the sub-camp itself
 vahiin par uske naam par kai bade kaarobaar shuru kiye gaye
 The family of Honeypreet was a devotee of Ram Rahim
 Actually, Priyanka Taneja's entire family has been a follower of the dera for the last several years

 Former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (MS Dhoni) is known for his calm behavior on the cricket field
 wicket ke aage or peeche unki chusti-furti dekhte hi banati he
 Dhoni may be 37 years old, but when he is behind the wicket, the opposition batsmen have to be very attentive

 Mahi is also unmatched in terms of running between the wickets

 Bollinger and Morkel took two wickets each for the hosts
 isse pehle vijay kii 127 ran kii laajawab pari main 11 chakke or aath chauke jade the, jisase rajasthan ke gendbaaj dhul chaatate dikhe

 Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan never tired of repeating this jumla that this is the new Pakistan, but the truth is that nothing has changed in Pakistan
 pakistan ab bhi apni zamin par aatankwaadiyon ko khaad-pani muhaiyaa kara rahaa he
 Tater is exporting all over the world from his own land and the extent is that he is lying on lies to hide these misdeeds
 alam ye he ki pakistan subah ek jhooth bolta he or shaam tak uski kalai khul jaati he
 Many fresh faces of Pakistan have been lost in fresh cases
 2 march 2019sabase pehle pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi kaa ye intervyuu dekhie, jisamen unhone ye kabool kiya ki jaish-e-mohammad kaa cheef moulana masood azhar pakistan main hi he or kuch itnaa biimaar he ki bistar se uth bhi nahin saktaa
 So how can he conduct a terrorist attack in Pulwama? On March 5, 2019, Pakistan's Minister of Internal Affairs Shaharyar Afridi held a press conference just three days after that
 jisamen mantri mahoday ne khud pakistan main chal rahe 70 se zyaada aatankwaadi sanghathanon par bain lagane kaa elaan kiya or kaha ki unki sarkaar ne pakistan ke mustakabil ke liye chalis se zyaada aatankwaadiyon ko hiraasat main le liya he
 March 6, 2019, but one day a tremendous U-turn came in this case, when the spokesman of the same Pakistan army, Major General Asif Ghafur, denied that there was anything called jaish-e-mohammed in Pakistan
 i am also jab jaish yahaan he hi nahin, to phir yahaan se pulavama main hamalaa karaae jane kaa sawaal hi kahaan paidaa hota he
 Asif Ghafoor said that jaish-e-mohammed has not made any claim to Pakistan regarding the Pulwama attack, because jaish-e-mohammed is not in Pakistan and it has been banned from the United Nations to the Government of Pakistan
 6 march 2019lekin ye bhi maanon had nahin thi
 Whatever Pakistan did after this, it was lost on all things till now
 pakistan main baithe pulavama hamale ke gunahagaar moulana masood azhar ne ek audio tepe jari kar naa sirf apni maut or beemaari kii tamaam khabaron ko jhuthla diya, balki pakistan sarkaar ko aatanki sanghathanon ke khilaaf kii ja rahi karrwai ke lekar dhamkee bhi de daali
 Terrorist leader Masood Azhar said in his audio that stop taking action on mosques, madrasas and Mujahideen
 yaad rakho jab ek musalmaan kaafiron ke khilaaf jang main peeth dikhaakar bhaagta he, to us par khuda kaa kufr nazil hota he
 There are reports of my death all over the world, but there is no doubt that there is one Allah who is the sacrifice of our life and death
 aaj kaa din bhi guzar gaya, ab raat ho rahi he or ye koi nahin jaanata ki jab aap ye audio clip sun rahe honge, tab main zindaa rahoonga bhi yaa nahin!ab sawaal ye uthta he ki akhir pakistan main ye chal kya rahaa he? akhir pakistan main sach koun bol rahaa he or jhooth koun? or ye sawaal isliye behad vaazib or mauzu he
 Because at this time, the eyes of the entire world, along with India, have become crooked on Pakistan regarding terrorist organizations running in Pakistan
 lekin pakistan he ki apni jhooth or pardadari se baaj nahin aa rahaa
 The game has ranged from terrorist organizations flourishing and flourishing in Pakistan to the ministers and army personnel
 aise main ab sawaal ye he ki ek aisa mulk jisamen har doosraa aadmi jhooth bol rahaa ho, akhir insaan bharosa kare to kis par kare, aitbaar kare to kis par? Biju Janata Dal president and Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has said that he has not taken any decision on support for the upcoming central government
 unhone party netaa pravaat treepathi ke us bayaan ko khaarij kar diya jisamen unhone endie sarkaar ko sashart samarthan ke sanket die the
 Naveen Patnaik said, 'I have told you that we have not taken any decision on this
 endie ko samarthan ke masale par koi charchaa nahin hui he
 Earlier, BJD Chief Whip Pravat Tripathi had told a news channel, "there is no problem in giving conditional support to the NDA government at the Center keeping in mind the public opinion and interest of the state
" ' odisha ke is pramukh dal ke paas philhal 14 saansad hai or is baar use behatar pradarshan kii ummid he
 BJD MP Jai Panda said that Naveen Patnaik was adamant on maintaining equal distance from BJP and Congress, although demands for support for the next government in the party were being raised
 puri se maujuuda bijedy saansad pinaki mishra ne kaha ki endie ko spasht bahumat nahin milegaa or agsit pole pehle bhi galat sabit hote rahe hai
 He claimed that BJD will get 16-17 seats and BJP one seat in the state
 unhone kaha, 'naveen babu (patnayak) ne kaha he ki ham bijepi or congress donon se dur rahenge
 We do not know about the support but we will need the support of the Central Government
