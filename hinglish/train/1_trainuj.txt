uski zindagi kya hui phir
 We are also going to discuss the diseases of bank employees separately in this series
 main yah sab ek do shikayaton ke aadhaar par nahin kah rahaa
 Believe it hazaron massej padhe hai
 After that i have prepared this feedback which i am giving to you and the government
 hamaari series ke teen chaar front hai
 Salary is more than that, to get a loan more than that, to sell a bad insurance policy using the trust of the customer
 teesraa he transfar
 There will be many of you who come to know that the insurance policy has been sold without your knowledge
 aap bahut achche dost hai or sahi myne main gandhi ji kii azaadi kaa maan rakhte hai
 You found it right that you are not afraid to name
 hamen sochna hoga ki naukari hamen zindaa rakhane ke liye he yaa maarane ke liye
 There is a lot of tension in our profession as well
 kam tanaav nahin he, lekin banking jaisaa mushkil kaam koi 10 baje subah se raat ke nau baje tak kyon karegaa
 What is the work that cannot be finished in eight hours
 jab se bank afasaron or karmchaariyon se beemaa bikwaaya ja rahaa he, mutual fund bikwaaya ja rahaa he, target ne unki zindagi khatm kar di he
 One should audit how many hours people work in the bank
 ham cross sailing ke liye jo target kaa aatank he us par alag se episod karenge, lekin bainkon ke bheetar ghulaam zindagi par baat bahut zaruri he
 Two things are known from this
 ek ki ham chote bacchon se bhi acha vyavhaar nahin karte hai
 Secondly, hundreds of male and female bankers have complained of this stress of work
 dabaav daalkar lone paas karavaaya ja rahaa he
 This series started with the matter of increasing salary, but looking at all the aspects of it, it seems that this economy is only liberal to say, there is a complete arrangement to keep human being enslaved within it
 ek banker clerk ne bataaya ki notebandi ke dauraan itnaa dabaav tha ki note ginaney main galati ho gai
 When he lost two and a half lakhs, he had to pay the loan alone
 agar saare banker yahi sach bol de ki notebandi ke dauraan hui galatiyon, sade gale noton or jaali noton ke badale kis-kis ne kitna jurmaana bharaa to uski sankhya kai karod main pahunch sakati he
 If a clerk gives two and a half lakh rupees from his pocket, what will be his condition? jabaki uski selary 20,000 bhi nahin hoti he
 All these things have been told by the bankers themselves
 ve bol nahin sakate to unki baton ko feedback ke taur par pesh kar rahaa hum
 If you take a print out of this, ask the above two percent officers and not the remaining 98 percent of the bankers will say yes on one thing
 kahenge ki yahi sahi he
 Mehul Choksi is yet to know which country he is honoring
 unke vakil sanjay eboat ne bataaya he ki mehul ko pratyrpan nideshaalay kaa saman to mila he magar passport radd hone ke kaaran yatra nahin kar sakate hai
 So has the government canceled his passport so that he cannot come to India
 yah khabar khushbu narayan or sadaaf modak kii he
 Printed in the Indian Express
 neerav modi ji bhi bharat bhoomi par abhi tak avatarit nahin hue hai
 Punjab National Bank has told the stock exchange on Monday that Nirav Modi and Mehul Chowksi have committed another fraud of Rs 1322 crore
 ab in donon ke frod ke kaaran punjab neshnal bank ko jo chuunaa laga he uski raashi 12,600 karod ho gai
 From 11,400 crores to 12, 600 crores but Nirav Modi ji has not come
 chaukasee ji kii chaowkee kahaan lagi he kisi ko pataa nahin he
 There is a news on Livemint that Nirav Modi's company Firestar Diamond has applied to be declared bankrupt
 iskaa kaaran bataaya he ki supplai chen main dikkat ho rahi he
 For a long time, the match was running unilaterally, so 97 against Ishmani China Mile Chairman Gurmit Singh Mann, Deputy Managing Director Gurpal Singh and others
 85 karod ke frod kaa cese darj hua he
 The comments gurpal singh punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ke damaad hai
 The Congress Party tweeted and welcomed the move of the CBI and later deleted it
 captain amarinder kaa kahana he ki gurpal singh keval 12
 5% is the shareholder
 unke damaad ko raajnneeti ke tahat khinchaa ja rahaa he
 Even then, the frauds of 12,600 crores are not caught, and if the fraudsters of 97 crores are caught, then that is also fine
 kam se kam yah to rahegaa ki kisi ko bakhsha nahin ja rahaa he
 What happened if the older one is not being caught, the younger one is not being spared
 vitt mantralay ne sabhi bainkon se kaha he ki ve 50 karod se upar ke sabhi enpie khaaton kii jaanch kare, dekhen ki unamem kya frod hua he or sibiai ko report karen
 The work of the CBI also increased, but even if it happened, even though Nirav Modi and Mehul Chauksi are not yet in the grip, once the Bhanda bursts, all the influential people of every party will be defeated but will it happen
 jab tak yah hota he aap una ke is bank kii tasviir dekhie
 Looks like darkness
 yah khuli jagah he
 This bank does not have a toilet
 state bank of india kaa he
 a customer has sent
 iskaa kahana he ki bank ke karmchaariyon ke liye shauchalay nahin he
 Banks should not take this as negative feedback
 bade bade ghotaale ke baad bhi bainkon kii chhavi kharaab nahin hoti to chintaa na karen, shauchalay na hone or aisi jagah main shouch karne kii tasviir se kuch fark nahin padane vaala he
 If the toilet is built here, then the people will praise the bank
 agar aapane tay kar liya he to phir aapako yah jaanakar khushi honi chahie ki kai rajyon main aapke bacchon ke padhane ke liye dhang kaa ek college tak nahin he
 Those colleges do not have teachers and those who are teaching on contract are being given twelve thousand rupees
 agar aap mata pita hai to apane bacchon ko kahie ki hamane tumhaari barbaadi kaa intazaam kar diya he chalo milakar tivi dekhte hai
 If you think I'm not right then ndtv
 in par jaakar uniwarsity series ke sabhi 27 ank dekh jaaiye or phir apane bachche ko dikhaaiye ki ham tumhen is college main barbaad hote dekhnaa chaahate hai, lekin abhi chalo tivi dekhte hai
 Let's see the bathtub of death
 aalochana ke baad bhi channelon kii nirlajjataa par koi asar nahin padaa
 Will not have to do any further kya isamen aapaki sahmati nahin he, ye jaanane ke liye aap fasebuk or whats ap ke massej check kiijie ki aap kya pard rahe hai, kya likh rahe hai or kya share or like kar rahe hai
 These channels will get the best channel award for a few days, an anchor will be the winner and then all will be well with the congratulatory messages
 tivi kam dekhie
 On this, there is either propaganda of lies, the leader's leadership is going on, a Hindu Muslim debate is run to convert you or your child into a human bomb
 26 farvari ko hamane prime time kii series main kuch bainkon ke shauchalay kaa haal dikhaaya tha
 The effect has been that Allahabad Bank, State Bank of India, Syndicate Bank and Indian Bank have come into action
 in sabane circular bhejkar mahilaon ke liye har branch main sau fisadi shauchalay kii vyavastha karne kaa elaan kiya he
 The lines running on your screen are the same circular
 patna ke pant bhawan main indian bank kii shakha main shauchalay kii vyavastha ko lekar khub meeting hui
 Allahabad Bank also mentioned its circular dated January 9, but did not say what happened during these circulars in a month
 elahabaad bank kaa circular kahata he ki purush or mahila donon ke liye shauchalay or pine ke pani kii uttam vyavastha honi chahie
 The message of the State Bank of India states that enditivi mahila karmchaariyon ke shauchalay kii suvidha par survey kar rahaa he, magar halke se chetavanee de di gai he ki chhavi ko nuksaan na pahunche yani banker mujhe kuch na bataaen
 now it's too late
 mujh tak bahut sari jaankariyaan pahunch chuki hai
 We have also seen many messages in which officers above the regional head talk to the branch manager in abusive language
 wo aisa karnaa jaldi band kar den varanaa un gaaliyon ko tivi par dikhaa duungaa
 How much do banks spend on their advertising? teen teen saal tak swatchta kaa binar taange rahe, tab unhone har shakha main mahilaon yaa purushon ke liye alag alag badhiya shauchalay kyon nahin banaaya
 Well now when it is made, the banks should inaugurate the prime time audience, as they are the viewers who were watching the series on the banks of a Zero TRP anchor, leaving the gimmick of channels on the tragic death of Sridevi
 aap sabhi darshakon ko aadhi badhai
 Full congratulations when the toilets are built
 neerav modi se ginen to bank series kaa yah 9waan ank he vaise bainke ke bheetar jo durdasha he uske hisaab se yah chatha ank hona chahie
 You should not lose heart by seeing this toilet, just increase the will power to control the stomach
 yah punjab ke kisi bank ke kisi shauchayal kaa he
 Promise to the sender that if i do not tell the name, i am playing
 darvaaze main kundi nahin he isliye baahar koi khadaa rahata he
 Female employees are not presently, but this toilet has to be used when it comes for investigation or with cash
 baahar koi khadaa rahata he
 You should also focus on why you have placed a chair next to the commode
 zarur kuch gir rahaa hoga, jise rokane ke liye kursi tikaa di gai hogi
 Think that when this chair has come here, what would have been kept where it was
 shaayad yaheen kii kursi toilet main rakhi he tabhi yahaan khatiya rakh di gai he
 Work is done by sitting on a cot
 is tarah se khaanaa garam karne kii mashin rakhi hui he
 Your banker is working in these circumstances
 is duusari tasviir ko dekhie
 Once there used to be a toilet, if there is no space, files have been kept
 badi sankhya main bank kii shakhaon se graahakon, reportron or peedit paksh ne feedback bhej die hai
 This feedback is the golden egg for any government
 chaahe to thik kar do din main vaahvahee lut sakati he
 If this happens, then i will not have to do this series till July
 is tarah se lagaataar to nahin magar bich bich main karata rahoonga
 The big officers of banks are smart
 jab shauchalay kii haalat dikhaai tab unhen hosh aayaa
 When i said that i will do this series till Diwali, many banks have started taking news of their branch
 yah himachal pradesh ke ek gramin bank ke shauchalay kaa haal he
 By seeing its picture, you will get to know how banks take care of their employees
 yah video kanpur ke punjab neshnal bank kii shyaam nagar shakha kaa he
 There is only one toilet outside the bank
 wo bhi is haalat main he
 a female employee also works here
 purush or stri donon ke liye ek hi shauchalay he
 i am not interested in reason and excuses, i am interested in showing what i have
 kend sarkaar kii mahilaon ko 180 din kaa maatrutiv avkaash miltaa he
 Together mothers can take child care leave for up to two years
 yaa to ek saath le sakati hai yaa phir 18 saal hone tak tukdon-tukdon main
 Can take that two-year leave
 magar usee kend sarkaar se niyantrit sarkari bainkon main mahilaon ko maatrutiv avkaash maatr 6 maheene kaa miltaa he
 Why is there such a difference? kya chairman sahab log ek din main mahila bankeron kaa maatrutiv avkaash ken sarkaar main kaam karne vaali mahilaon ke baraabar nahin kar sakate hai
 How is this difference so far
 hamaare enditivi main to ham purushon ko 15 din kaa pitrutv avkaash miltaa he
 The condition of male officers is also bad
 jo sheersh ke do pratishat adhikari hai rizanal head tip unki kaaphi mouj he, magar neeche ke manageron ko raat ke nau nau baje tak bank main rukna padataa he
 After all, how does someone like banking work from ten in the morning to ten in the night
 uski zindagi kya hui phir
 We are also going to discuss the diseases of bank employees separately in this series
 main yah sab ek do shikayaton ke aadhaar par nahin kah rahaa
 Believe it hazaron massej padhe hai
 After that i have prepared this feedback which i am giving to you and the government

 Watch tv less is par yaa to jhooth kaa propeganda chalata he, netaa kii netagiri chal rahi he, aapako yaa aapke bachche ko maanav bam main badalane ke liye hindu muslim dibet chalaaya jaataa he
 On 26 February, we showed the condition of some banks' toilets in the prime time series
 asar ye hua he ki elahabaad bank, state bank of india, sindicket bank or indian bank harakat main aayaa he
 All of them have sent circulars and announced to make 100 percent toilets for women in every branch
 aapke screen par jo panktiyaan chal rahi hai unheen circular kii hai
 There was a lot of meeting regarding toilet arrangements in Indian Bank branch in Pant Bhawan, Patna
 elahabaad bank ne to 9 janvari ke apane circular kaa bhi zikr kar diya magar yah nahin bataaya ki ek maheene ke bich in circulron ke dauraan hua kya
 Allahabad Bank's circular says that there should be a good toilet and drinking water for both men and women
 state bank of india ke messej main kaha gaya he ki NDTV is surveying the toilet facilities of women employees, but has been lightly warned not to damage the image, that is, the bankers should not tell me anything
 ab bahut der ho chuki he
 a lot of information has reached me
 hamane kai massej aise bhi dekhe hai jinamein riginal head se upar ke adhikari shakhaon ke manager se abhadra bhashaa main baat karte hai
 He should stop doing this early or else he will show those abuses on TV
 bank apane vigyaapan par kitna karch karte hai
 For three-three years, they kept the banner of cleanliness, then why did they not make different toilets for women or men in every branch
 vaise ab jab ban jayega to bainkon ko prime time ke darshak se udghaatan karana chahie, kyonki yahi wo darshak hai jo shridevi kii dukhad maut par channelon kii nautanki chhodkar ek zero tiarapy ankar kii bainkon par series dekh rahe the
 Half congratulations to all of you viewers
 puri badhai tab jab shauchalay ban jaaenge
 If you count Nirav Modi, this is the 9th issue of the bank series, however, according to the predicament within the bank, it should be the sixth digit
 is shauchalay ko dekhakar aap dil na chota karen bas pet par niyantran karne kii ichhashakti badi kar len
 It belongs to a toilet of a bank in Punjab
 bhejne vaale se vaada he ki naam na bataaun to nibhaa rahaa hum
 There is no latch in the door so someone stands outside
 mahila karmchaaree philhal nahin hai magar jab jaanch ke liye yaa cash ke saath aati hai to isi shauchalay kaa istamaal karnaa padataa he
 Someone stands outside
 camod ke bagal main kursi kyon rakhi he is par aap bhi kuch dimag lagaaiye
 There must be something falling, which the chair must have been placed to prevent
 sochie ki jab yah kursi yahaan aa gai he to jahaan ye thi vahaan kya rakhaa hoga
 Probably this chair is kept in the toilet, only then the cot is kept here
 khatiya par baithkar kaam hota he
 In this way the food heating machine is kept
 aapkaa banker in halaat main kaam kar rahaa he
 Look at this second picture
 kabhi yahaan toilet hua karata tha, jagah nahin he to filein rakh di gai hai
 Customers, reporters and the aggrieved party have sent feedback from a large number of bank branches
 kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye yah feedback sone kaa anda he
 If you want, you can get accolades in two days
 aisa ho jaae to mujhe bhi july tak yah series nahin kerani padegi
 In this way i will keep doing it continuously but not in the middle
 bainkon ke jo bade afasar hai chaalaak hote hai
 When the condition of the toilet was shown, he became aware
 jab maine kaha ki diwali tak yah series karuunga to kai bainkon ne apane branch kii khabar leni shuru kar di he
 This is the toilet for a rural bank in Himachal Pradesh
 isaki tasviir dekhakar aapako pataa chal jayega ki bank apane karmchaariyon kaa kis tarah khyaal rakhte hai
 This video is from Shyam Nagar branch of Punjab National Bank, Kanpur
 yahaan ek hi shauchalay he jo bank ke baahar he
 He is also in this condition
 yahaan ek mahila karmchaaree bhi kaam karti hai
 There is only one toilet for both men and women
 kaaran or bahaane main meri dilchaspee nahin he, meri dilchaspee jo he use dikhaane main he
 Central government women get 180 days maternity leave
 saath main maanen do saal tak child care live le sakati hai
 Can be taken together or in pieces until it is 18 years old
 us do saal kii chuttee le sakati hai
 But in the same central government-controlled government banks, women get maternity leave of only 6 months
 itnaa antar kyon he
 Can not the chairman, one day, equal the maternity leave of women bankers to women working in the government
 yah antar abhi tak kaise he
 In our NDTV, we men get 15 days paternity leave
 purush adhikariyon kaa bhi haal bura he
 Regional head type, who are the top two percent of the officers, have a lot of fun, but the managers below have to stay in the bank till nine o'clock in the night
 aakhir banking jaisaa kaam koi subah ke das baje se lekar raat ke das baje tak kaise karata he
 What happened to his life then? ham bank karmchaariyon kii bimariyon par bhi alag se is series main charchaa karne vaale hai
 i am not saying all this on the basis of one or two complaints
 yakeen kiijie
 Have read thousands of messages
 uske baad ye feedback taiyaar kiya he jo main aapako or sarkaar ko de rahaa hum
 Our series has three to four front
 selary to he hi, usase zyada jabaran lone dilvaanaa, graahak ke bharose kaa istemaal kar kharaab beemaa polisy bikwaana
 The third is transfer
 aapmen se bahut se log honge jinhen pataa chal gaya hoga ki bina aapaki jaankaree ke hi beemaa policy bech di gai he
 You are very good friends and truly believe in Gandhiji's independence
 aapaki baat sahi lagi ki aap naam bataane se nahin darate
 We have to think whether the job is to keep us alive or to kill us
 hamaare peshey main bhi kaaphi tanaav he
 There is no less stress, but why would anyone do a difficult job like banking from 10 am to 9 pm
 aisa koun sa kaam he jo aath ghante main khatm nahin ho saktaa he
 Ever since insurance is being sold by bank officers and employees, mutual funds are being sold, the target has ended their lives
 kisi ko isi baat kii audit kerani chahie ki bank main log kitne ghante kaam karte hai
 We will do separate episodes on the target terror for cross selling, but it is very important to talk about the slave life within the banks
 isse do baaten pataa chalati he
 One is that we do not treat small children well
 doosraa ki sainkadon kii sankhya main purush or mahila bankeron ne kaam ke is tanaav kii shikaayat kii he
 The loan is being passed under pressure
 yah series selary badhaane kii baat se shuru hui thi magar iske tamaam pahaluon ko dekhte hue yahi lagata he ki yah arthvyavastha kehane ko hi udaar he, iske bheetar insaan ko ghulaam banaakar rakhane kaa puraa intazaam he
 a banker's clerk said that there was so much pressure during the note ban that there was a mistake in counting the note
 dhai lakh kam hue to use akele lone lekar bharpai kerani padi
 If all the bankers can tell the truth that who has paid a fine in lieu of the mistakes made during the note ban, rotten neck notes and fake notes, then his number can reach several crores
 ek clerk dhai lakh rupee apni jeb se de to uski kya haalat hogi
 While his salary is not even 20,000
 ye sari baaten bankeron ne khud bataai he
 If they cannot speak, then i am presenting their words as feedback
 aap iskaa print out lekar upar ke do pratishat vaale afasaron se nahin baaki 98 pratishat bankeron se puuchhie ek ek baat par haa kahenge
 Will say that this is true
 mehul chaukasee kaa abhi tak pataa nahin chalaa ki ve kis desh kaa sammaan badha rahe hai
 His lawyer Sanjay Abbot has said that Mehul has received the extradition directorate's summons but cannot travel due to the cancellation of the passport
 to kya sarkaar ne inkaa passport isliye radd kiya he ki ye bharat na aa saken
 This news is of Khushboo Narayan and Sadaf Modak
 indian express main chhapi he
 Nirav Modi ji has not even landed on India soil yet
 punjab neshnal bank ne somvaar ko stock exange se kaha he ki neerav modi or mehul chaukasee ne 1322 karod kaa ek or frod kiya he
 Now due to the fraud of these two, the amount of lime that Punjab National Bank has lost has increased to 12,600 crore
 11,400 karod se badhkar 12, 600 karod ho gai he magar neerav modi ji nahin aae hai
 No one knows where the guard post is located
 livemint par ek khabar he ki neerav modi kii company firestar diamond ne bankerpat ghoshit hone ke liye aavedan kiya he
 The reason for this is that the supply chain is facing problems
 bahut dinon se match ekatarfa chal rahaa tha to iz ikval tu karne ke liye simbholi china mile ke chairman gurmit singh maan, up prabandh nideshak gurpal singh or anya ke khilaaf 97
 a case of fraud worth 85 crores has been registered
 tippaniyan Gurpal Singh is the son-in-law of Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh
 congress party ne sibiai ke is kadam kaa swaagat karte hue twit kiya phir baad main dilit kar diya
 Capt Amarinder says that Gurpal Singh only 12
 5 pratishat share ke hissedaar hai
 His son-in-law is being dragged under politics
 phir bhi 12,600 karod ke fradiye pakad main na aae or uske badale 97 karod kaa frod karne vaale pakadaa jaae to vah bhi thik he
 At least it will remain that no one is being spared
 bade vaale ko pakadaa nahin ja rahaa to kya hua, chote vaale ko bakhsha nahin ja rahaa he
 The Finance Ministry has asked all banks to examine all NPA accounts above Rs 50 crore, see what has been frauded in them and report to the CBI
 sibiai kaa kaam bhi bad gaya lekin agar yah hua to bhale hi neerav modi or mehul chaukasee abhi pakad main nahin aa rahaa he magar ek baar bhanda phute to har dal ke sarvadaleey prabhaavshaalee log dharaa jaaenge lekin kya aisa hoga
 Till this time you see the picture of this bank of Una
 andhera jaisaa dikh rahaa he
 It is an open space
 is bank main shauchalay nahin he
 Belongs to the State Bank of India
 ek graahak ne bheja he
 It says that the bank does not have a toilet for its employees
 bank ise negative feedback ke rup main na len
 Even after the big scam, if the image of the banks does not deteriorate, do not worry, the picture of not having toilets and defecation in such a place is going to make no difference
 agar yahaan shauchalay ban jayega to ulta log bank kii tarif karenge
 On 26 February, we showed the condition of some banks' toilets in the prime time series
 asar ye hua he ki elahabaad bank, state bank of india, sindicket bank or indian bank harakat main aayaa he

 vaise ab jab ban jayega to bainkon ko prime time ke darshak se udghaatan karana chahie, kyonki yahi wo darshak hai jo shridevi kii dukhad maut par channelon kii nautanki chhodkar ek zero tiarapy ankar kii bainkon par series dekh rahe the
 Half congratulations to all of you viewers
 puri badhai tab jab shauchalay ban jaaenge
 If you count Nirav Modi, this is the 9th issue of the bank series, however, according to the predicament within the bank, it should be the sixth digit
 is shauchalay ko dekhakar aap dil na chota karen bas pet par niyantran karne kii ichhashakti badi kar len
 It belongs to a toilet of a bank in Punjab
 bhejne vaale se vaada he ki naam na bataaun to nibhaa rahaa hum
 There is no latch in the door so someone stands outside
 mahila karmchaaree philhal nahin hai magar jab jaanch ke liye yaa cash ke saath aati hai to isi shauchalay kaa istamaal karnaa padataa he
 Someone stands outside
 camod ke bagal main kursi kyon rakhi he is par aap bhi kuch dimag lagaaiye
 There must be something falling, which the chair must have been placed to prevent
 sochie ki jab yah kursi yahaan aa gai he to jahaan ye thi vahaan kya rakhaa hoga
 Probably this chair is kept in the toilet, only then the cot is kept here
 khatiya par baithkar kaam hota he
 In this way the food heating machine is kept
 aapkaa banker in halaat main kaam kar rahaa he
 Look at this second picture
 kabhi yahaan toilet hua karata tha, jagah nahin he to filein rakh di gai hai
 Customers, reporters and the aggrieved party have sent feedback from a large number of bank branches
 kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye yah feedback sone kaa anda he
 If you want, you can get accolades in two days
 aisa ho jaae to mujhe bhi july tak yah series nahin kerani padegi
 In this way i will keep doing it continuously but not in the middle
 bainkon ke jo bade afasar hai chaalaak hote hai
 When the condition of the toilet was shown, he became aware
 jab maine kaha ki diwali tak yah series karuunga to kai bainkon ne apane branch kii khabar leni shuru kar di he
 This is the toilet for a rural bank in Himachal Pradesh
 isaki tasviir dekhakar aapako pataa chal jayega ki bank apane karmchaariyon kaa kis tarah khyaal rakhte hai
 This video is from Shyam Nagar branch of Punjab National Bank, Kanpur
 yahaan ek hi shauchalay he jo bank ke baahar he
 He is also in this condition
 yahaan ek mahila karmchaaree bhi kaam karti hai
 There is only one toilet for both men and women
 kaaran or bahaane main meri dilchaspee nahin he, meri dilchaspee jo he use dikhaane main he
 Central government women get 180 days maternity leave
 saath main maanen do saal tak child care live le sakati hai
 Can be taken together or in pieces until it is 18 years old
 us do saal kii chuttee le sakati hai
 But in the same central government-controlled government banks, women get maternity leave of only 6 months
 itnaa antar kyon he
 Can not the chairman, one day, equal the maternity leave of women bankers to women working in the government
 yah antar abhi tak kaise he
 In our NDTV, we men get 15 days paternity leave
 purush adhikariyon kaa bhi haal bura he
 Regional head type, who are the top two percent of the officers, have a lot of fun, but the managers below have to stay in the bank till nine o'clock in the night
 aakhir banking jaisaa kaam koi subah ke das baje se lekar raat ke das baje tak kaise karata he
 What happened to his life then? ham bank karmchaariyon kii bimariyon par bhi alag se is series main charchaa karne vaale hai
 i am not saying all this on the basis of one or two complaints
 yakeen kiijie
 Have read thousands of messages
 uske baad ye feedback taiyaar kiya he jo main aapako or sarkaar ko de rahaa hum
 Our series has three to four front
 selary to he hi, usase zyada jabaran lone dilvaanaa, graahak ke bharose kaa istemaal kar kharaab beemaa polisy bikwaana
 The third is transfer
 aapmen se bahut se log honge jinhen pataa chal gaya hoga ki bina aapaki jaankaree ke hi beemaa policy bech di gai he
 You are very good friends and truly believe in Gandhiji's independence
 aapaki baat sahi lagi ki aap naam bataane se nahin darate
 We have to think whether the job is to keep us alive or to kill us
 hamaare peshey main bhi kaaphi tanaav he
 There is no less stress, but why would anyone do a difficult job like banking from 10 am to 9 pm
 aisa koun sa kaam he jo aath ghante main khatm nahin ho saktaa he
 Ever since insurance is being sold by bank officers and employees, mutual funds are being sold, the target has ended their lives
 kisi ko isi baat kii audit kerani chahie ki bank main log kitne ghante kaam karte hai
 We will do separate episodes on the target terror for cross selling, but it is very important to talk about the slave life within the banks
 isse do baaten pataa chalati he
 One is that we do not treat small children well
 doosraa ki sainkadon kii sankhya main purush or mahila bankeron ne kaam ke is tanaav kii shikaayat kii he
 The loan is being passed under pressure
 yah series selary badhaane kii baat se shuru hui thi magar iske tamaam pahaluon ko dekhte hue yahi lagata he ki yah arthvyavastha kehane ko hi udaar he, iske bheetar insaan ko ghulaam banaakar rakhane kaa puraa intazaam he
 a banker's clerk said that there was so much pressure during the note ban that there was a mistake in counting the note
 dhai lakh kam hue to use akele lone lekar bharpai kerani padi
 If all the bankers can tell the truth that who has paid a fine in lieu of the mistakes made during the note ban, rotten neck notes and fake notes, then his number can reach several crores
 ek clerk dhai lakh rupee apni jeb se de to uski kya haalat hogi
 While his salary is not even 20,000
 ye sari baaten bankeron ne khud bataai he
 If they cannot speak, then i am presenting their words as feedback
 aap iskaa print out lekar upar ke do pratishat vaale afasaron se nahin baaki 98 pratishat bankeron se puuchhie ek ek baat par haa kahenge
 Will say that this is true
 mehul chaukasee kaa abhi tak pataa nahin chalaa ki ve kis desh kaa sammaan badha rahe hai
 His lawyer Sanjay Abbot has said that Mehul has received the extradition directorate's summons but cannot travel due to the cancellation of the passport
 to kya sarkaar ne inkaa passport isliye radd kiya he ki ye bharat na aa saken
 This news is of Khushboo Narayan and Sadaf Modak
 indian express main chhapi he
 Nirav Modi ji has not even landed on India soil yet
 punjab neshnal bank ne somvaar ko stock exange se kaha he ki neerav modi or mehul chaukasee ne 1322 karod kaa ek or frod kiya he
 Now due to the fraud of these two, the amount of lime that Punjab National Bank has lost has increased to 12,600 crore
 11,400 karod se badhkar 12, 600 karod ho gai he magar neerav modi ji nahin aae hai
 No one knows where the guard post is located
 livemint par ek khabar he ki neerav modi kii company firestar diamond ne bankerpat ghoshit hone ke liye aavedan kiya he
 The reason for this is that the supply chain is facing problems
 bahut dinon se match ekatarfa chal rahaa tha to iz ikval tu karne ke liye simbholi china mile ke chairman gurmit singh maan, up prabandh nideshak gurpal singh or anya ke khilaaf 97
 a case of fraud worth 85 crores has been registered
 tippaniyan Gurpal Singh is the son-in-law of Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh
 congress party ne sibiai ke is kadam kaa swaagat karte hue twit kiya phir baad main dilit kar diya
 Capt Amarinder says that Gurpal Singh only 12
 5 pratishat share ke hissedaar hai
 His son-in-law is being dragged under politics
 phir bhi 12,600 karod ke fradiye pakad main na aae or uske badale 97 karod kaa frod karne vaale pakadaa jaae to vah bhi thik he
 At least it will remain that no one is being spared
 bade vaale ko pakadaa nahin ja rahaa to kya hua, chote vaale ko bakhsha nahin ja rahaa he
 The Finance Ministry has asked all banks to examine all NPA accounts above Rs 50 crore, see what has been frauded in them and report to the CBI
 sibiai kaa kaam bhi bad gaya lekin agar yah hua to bhale hi neerav modi or mehul chaukasee abhi pakad main nahin aa rahaa he magar ek baar bhanda phute to har dal ke sarvadaleey prabhaavshaalee log dharaa jaaenge lekin kya aisa hoga
 Till this time you see the picture of this bank of Una
 andhera jaisaa dikh rahaa he
 It is an open space
 is bank main shauchalay nahin he
 Belongs to the State Bank of India
 ek graahak ne bheja he
 It says that the bank does not have a toilet for its employees
 bank ise negative feedback ke rup main na len
 Even after the big scam, if the image of the banks does not deteriorate, do not worry, the picture of not having toilets and defecation in such a place is going to make no difference
 agar yahaan shauchalay ban jayega to ulta log bank kii tarif karenge
 How much do banks spend on their advertising? teen teen saal tak swatchta kaa binar taange rahe, tab unhone har shakha main mahilaon yaa purushon ke liye alag alag badhiya shauchalay kyon nahin banaaya
 Well now when it is made, the banks should inaugurate the prime time audience, as they are the viewers who were watching the series on the banks of a Zero TRP anchor, leaving the gimmick of channels on the tragic death of Sridevi
 aap sabhi darshakon ko aadhi badhai
 Full congratulations when the toilets are built
 neerav modi se ginen to bank series kaa yah 9waan ank he vaise bainke ke bheetar jo durdasha he uske hisaab se yah chatha ank hona chahie
 You should not lose heart by seeing this toilet, just increase the will power to control the stomach
 yah punjab ke kisi bank ke kisi shauchayal kaa he
 Promise to the sender that if i do not tell the name, i am playing
 darvaaze main kundi nahin he isliye baahar koi khadaa rahata he
 Female employees are not presently, but this toilet has to be used when it comes for investigation or with cash
 baahar koi khadaa rahata he
 You should also focus on why you have placed a chair next to the commode
 zarur kuch gir rahaa hoga, jise rokane ke liye kursi tikaa di gai hogi
 Think that when this chair has come here, what would have been kept where it was
 shaayad yaheen kii kursi toilet main rakhi he tabhi yahaan khatiya rakh di gai he
 Work is done by sitting on a cot
 is tarah se khaanaa garam karne kii mashin rakhi hui he
 Your banker is working in these circumstances
 is duusari tasviir ko dekhie
 Once there used to be a toilet, if there is no space, files have been kept
 badi sankhya main bank kii shakhaon se graahakon, reportron or peedit paksh ne feedback bhej die hai
 This feedback is the golden egg for any government
 chaahe to thik kar do din main vaahvahee lut sakati he
 If this happens, then i will not have to do this series till July
 is tarah se lagaataar to nahin magar bich bich main karata rahoonga
 The big officers of banks are smart
 jab shauchalay kii haalat dikhaai tab unhen hosh aayaa
 When i said that i will do this series till Diwali, many banks have started taking news of their branch
 yah himachal pradesh ke ek gramin bank ke shauchalay kaa haal he
 By seeing its picture, you will get to know how banks take care of their employees
 yah video kanpur ke punjab neshnal bank kii shyaam nagar shakha kaa he
 There is only one toilet outside the bank
 wo bhi is haalat main he
 a female employee also works here
 purush or stri donon ke liye ek hi shauchalay he
 i am not interested in reason and excuses, i am interested in showing what i have
 kend sarkaar kii mahilaon ko 180 din kaa maatrutiv avkaash miltaa he
 Together mothers can take child care leave for up to two years
 yaa to ek saath le sakati hai yaa phir 18 saal hone tak tukdon-tukdon main
 Can take that two-year leave
 magar usee kend sarkaar se niyantrit sarkari bainkon main mahilaon ko maatrutiv avkaash maatr 6 maheene kaa miltaa he
 Why is there such a difference? kya chairman sahab log ek din main mahila bankeron kaa maatrutiv avkaash ken sarkaar main kaam karne vaali mahilaon ke baraabar nahin kar sakate hai
 How is this difference so far
 hamaare enditivi main to ham purushon ko 15 din kaa pitrutv avkaash miltaa he
 The condition of male officers is also bad
 jo sheersh ke do pratishat adhikari hai rizanal head tip unki kaaphi mouj he, magar neeche ke manageron ko raat ke nau nau baje tak bank main rukna padataa he
 After all, how does someone like banking work from ten in the morning to ten in the night
 uski zindagi kya hui phir
 We are also going to discuss the diseases of bank employees separately in this series
 main yah sab ek do shikayaton ke aadhaar par nahin kah rahaa
 Believe it hazaron massej padhe hai
 After that i have prepared this feedback which i am giving to you and the government
 hamaari series ke teen chaar front hai
 Salary is more than that, to get a loan more than that, to sell a bad insurance policy using the trust of the customer
 teesraa he transfar
 There will be many of you who come to know that the insurance policy has been sold without your knowledge
 aap bahut achche dost hai or sahi myne main gandhi ji kii azaadi kaa maan rakhte hai
 You found it right that you are not afraid to name
 hamen sochna hoga ki naukari hamen zindaa rakhane ke liye he yaa maarane ke liye
 There is a lot of tension in our profession as well
 kam tanaav nahin he, lekin banking jaisaa mushkil kaam koi 10 baje subah se raat ke nau baje tak kyon karegaa
 What is the work that cannot be finished in eight hours
 jab se bank afasaron or karmchaariyon se beemaa bikwaaya ja rahaa he, mutual fund bikwaaya ja rahaa he, target ne unki zindagi khatm kar di he
 One should audit how many hours people work in the bank
 ham cross sailing ke liye jo target kaa aatank he us par alag se episod karenge, lekin bainkon ke bheetar ghulaam zindagi par baat bahut zaruri he
 Two things are known from this
 ek ki ham chote bacchon se bhi acha vyavhaar nahin karte hai
 Secondly, hundreds of male and female bankers have complained of this stress of work
 dabaav daalkar lone paas karavaaya ja rahaa he
 This series started with the matter of increasing salary, but looking at all the aspects of it, it seems that this economy is only liberal to say, there is a complete arrangement to keep human being enslaved within it
 ek banker clerk ne bataaya ki notebandi ke dauraan itnaa dabaav tha ki note ginaney main galati ho gai
 When he lost two and a half lakhs, he had to pay the loan alone
 agar saare banker yahi sach bol de ki notebandi ke dauraan hui galatiyon, sade gale noton or jaali noton ke badale kis-kis ne kitna jurmaana bharaa to uski sankhya kai karod main pahunch sakati he
 If a clerk gives two and a half lakh rupees from his pocket, what will be his condition? jabaki uski selary 20,000 bhi nahin hoti he
 All these things have been told by the bankers themselves
 ve bol nahin sakate to unki baton ko feedback ke taur par pesh kar rahaa hum
 If you take a print out of this, ask the above two percent officers and not the remaining 98 percent of the bankers will say yes on one thing
 kahenge ki yahi sahi he
 Mehul Choksi is yet to know which country he is honoring
 unke vakil sanjay eboat ne bataaya he ki mehul ko pratyrpan nideshaalay kaa saman to mila he magar passport radd hone ke kaaran yatra nahin kar sakate hai
 So has the government canceled his passport so that he cannot come to India
 yah khabar khushbu narayan or sadaaf modak kii he
 Printed in the Indian Express
 neerav modi ji bhi bharat bhoomi par abhi tak avatarit nahin hue hai
 Punjab National Bank has told the stock exchange on Monday that Nirav Modi and Mehul Chowksi have committed another fraud of Rs 1322 crore
 ab in donon ke frod ke kaaran punjab neshnal bank ko jo chuunaa laga he uski raashi 12,600 karod ho gai
 From 11,400 crores to 12, 600 crores but Nirav Modi ji has not come
 chaukasee ji kii chaowkee kahaan lagi he kisi ko pataa nahin he
 There is a news on Livemint that Nirav Modi's company Firestar Diamond has applied to be declared bankrupt
 iskaa kaaran bataaya he ki supplai chen main dikkat ho rahi he
 For a long time, the match was running unilaterally, so 97 against Ishmani China Mile Chairman Gurmit Singh Mann, Deputy Managing Director Gurpal Singh and others
 85 karod ke frod kaa cese darj hua he
 The comments gurpal singh punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ke damaad hai
 The Congress Party tweeted and welcomed the move of the CBI and later deleted it
 captain amarinder kaa kahana he ki gurpal singh keval 12
 5% is the shareholder
 unke damaad ko raajnneeti ke tahat khinchaa ja rahaa he
 Even then, the frauds of 12,600 crores are not caught, and if the fraudsters of 97 crores are caught, then that is also fine
 kam se kam yah to rahegaa ki kisi ko bakhsha nahin ja rahaa he
 What happened if the older one is not being caught, the younger one is not being spared
 vitt mantralay ne sabhi bainkon se kaha he ki ve 50 karod se upar ke sabhi enpie khaaton kii jaanch kare, dekhen ki unamem kya frod hua he or sibiai ko report karen
 The work of the CBI also increased, but even if it happened, even though Nirav Modi and Mehul Chauksi are not yet in the grip, once the Bhanda bursts, all the influential people of every party will be defeated but will it happen
 jab tak yah hota he aap una ke is bank kii tasviir dekhie
 Looks like darkness
 yah khuli jagah he
 This bank does not have a toilet
 state bank of india kaa he
 a customer has sent
 iskaa kahana he ki bank ke karmchaariyon ke liye shauchalay nahin he
 Banks should not take this as negative feedback
 bade bade ghotaale ke baad bhi bainkon kii chhavi kharaab nahin hoti to chintaa na karen, shauchalay na hone or aisi jagah main shouch karne kii tasviir se kuch fark nahin padane vaala he
 If the toilet is built here, then the people will praise the bank
 is shauchalay ko dekhakar aap dil na chota karen bas pet par niyantran karne kii ichhashakti badi kar len
 It belongs to a toilet of a bank in Punjab
 bhejne vaale se vaada he ki naam na bataaun to nibhaa rahaa hum
 There is no latch in the door so someone stands outside
 mahila karmchaaree philhal nahin hai magar jab jaanch ke liye yaa cash ke saath aati hai to isi shauchalay kaa istamaal karnaa padataa he

 Central government women get 180 days maternity leave
 saath main maanen do saal tak child care live le sakati hai
 Can be taken together or in pieces until it is 18 years old
 us do saal kii chuttee le sakati hai
 But in the same central government-controlled government banks, women get maternity leave of only 6 months
 itnaa antar kyon he
 Can not the chairman, one day, equal the maternity leave of women bankers to women working in the government

 i am not saying all this on the basis of one or two complaints
 yakeen kiijie
 Have read thousands of messages
 uske baad ye feedback taiyaar kiya he jo main aapako or sarkaar ko de rahaa hum
 Our series has three to four front
 selary to he hi, usase zyada jabaran lone dilvaanaa, graahak ke bharose kaa istemaal kar kharaab beemaa polisy bikwaana
 The third is transfer
 aapmen se bahut se log honge jinhen pataa chal gaya hoga ki bina aapaki jaankaree ke hi beemaa policy bech di gai he
 You are very good friends and truly believe in Gandhiji's independence
 aapaki baat sahi lagi ki aap naam bataane se nahin darate
 We have to think whether the job is to keep us alive or to kill us
 hamaare peshey main bhi kaaphi tanaav he
 There is no less stress, but why would anyone do a difficult job like banking from 10 am to 9 pm
 aisa koun sa kaam he jo aath ghante main khatm nahin ho saktaa he
 Ever since insurance is being sold by bank officers and employees, mutual funds are being sold, the target has ended their lives
 kisi ko isi baat kii audit kerani chahie ki bank main log kitne ghante kaam karte hai
 We will do separate episodes on the target terror for cross selling, but it is very important to talk about the slave life within the banks
 isse do baaten pataa chalati he
 One is that we do not treat small children well
 doosraa ki sainkadon kii sankhya main purush or mahila bankeron ne kaam ke is tanaav kii shikaayat kii he
 The loan is being passed under pressure
 yah series selary badhaane kii baat se shuru hui thi magar iske tamaam pahaluon ko dekhte hue yahi lagata he ki yah arthvyavastha kehane ko hi udaar he, iske bheetar insaan ko ghulaam banaakar rakhane kaa puraa intazaam he
 a banker's clerk said that there was so much pressure during the note ban that there was a mistake in counting the note
 dhai lakh kam hue to use akele lone lekar bharpai kerani padi
 If all the bankers can tell the truth that who has paid a fine in lieu of the mistakes made during the note ban, rotten neck notes and fake notes, then his number can reach several crores
 ek clerk dhai lakh rupee apni jeb se de to uski kya haalat hogi
 While his salary is not even 20,000
 ye sari baaten bankeron ne khud bataai he
 If they cannot speak, then i am presenting their words as feedback
 aap iskaa print out lekar upar ke do pratishat vaale afasaron se nahin baaki 98 pratishat bankeron se puuchhie ek ek baat par haa kahenge
 Will say that this is true
 mehul chaukasee kaa abhi tak pataa nahin chalaa ki ve kis desh kaa sammaan badha rahe hai
 His lawyer Sanjay Abbot has said that Mehul has received the extradition directorate's summons but cannot travel due to the cancellation of the passport
 to kya sarkaar ne inkaa passport isliye radd kiya he ki ye bharat na aa saken
 This news is of Khushboo Narayan and Sadaf Modak
 indian express main chhapi he
 Nirav Modi ji has not even landed on India soil yet
 punjab neshnal bank ne somvaar ko stock exange se kaha he ki neerav modi or mehul chaukasee ne 1322 karod kaa ek or frod kiya he
 Now due to the fraud of these two, the amount of lime that Punjab National Bank has lost has increased to 12,600 crore
 11,400 karod se badhkar 12, 600 karod ho gai he magar neerav modi ji nahin aae hai
 No one knows where the guard post is located
 livemint par ek khabar he ki neerav modi kii company firestar diamond ne bankerpat ghoshit hone ke liye aavedan kiya he
 The reason for this is that the supply chain is facing problems
 bahut dinon se match ekatarfa chal rahaa tha to iz ikval tu karne ke liye simbholi china mile ke chairman gurmit singh maan, up prabandh nideshak gurpal singh or anya ke khilaaf 97
 a case of fraud worth 85 crores has been registered
 tippaniyan Gurpal Singh is the son-in-law of Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh
 congress party ne sibiai ke is kadam kaa swaagat karte hue twit kiya phir baad main dilit kar diya
 Capt Amarinder says that Gurpal Singh only 12
 5 pratishat share ke hissedaar hai
 His son-in-law is being dragged under politics
 phir bhi 12,600 karod ke fradiye pakad main na aae or uske badale 97 karod kaa frod karne vaale pakadaa jaae to vah bhi thik he
 At least it will remain that no one is being spared
 bade vaale ko pakadaa nahin ja rahaa to kya hua, chote vaale ko bakhsha nahin ja rahaa he
 The Finance Ministry has asked all banks to examine all NPA accounts above Rs 50 crore, see what has been frauded in them and report to the CBI
 sibiai kaa kaam bhi bad gaya lekin agar yah hua to bhale hi neerav modi or mehul chaukasee abhi pakad main nahin aa rahaa he magar ek baar bhanda phute to har dal ke sarvadaleey prabhaavshaalee log dharaa jaaenge lekin kya aisa hoga
 Till this time you see the picture of this bank of Una
 andhera jaisaa dikh rahaa he
 It is an open space
 is bank main shauchalay nahin he
 Belongs to the State Bank of India
 ek graahak ne bheja he
 It says that the bank does not have a toilet for its employees
 bank ise negative feedback ke rup main na len
 Even after the big scam, if the image of the banks does not deteriorate, do not worry, the picture of not having toilets and defecation in such a place is going to make no difference
 agar yahaan shauchalay ban jayega to ulta log bank kii tarif karenge
 The big officers of banks are smart
 jab shauchalay kii haalat dikhaai tab unhen hosh aayaa
 When i said that i will do this series till Diwali, many banks have started taking news of their branch
 yah himachal pradesh ke ek gramin bank ke shauchalay kaa haal he
 By seeing its picture, you will get to know how banks take care of their employees
 yah video kanpur ke punjab neshnal bank kii shyaam nagar shakha kaa he
 There is only one toilet outside the bank
 wo bhi is haalat main he
 a female employee also works here
 purush or stri donon ke liye ek hi shauchalay he
 i am not interested in reason and excuses, i am interested in showing what i have
 kend sarkaar kii mahilaon ko 180 din kaa maatrutiv avkaash miltaa he
 Together mothers can take child care leave for up to two years
 yaa to ek saath le sakati hai yaa phir 18 saal hone tak tukdon-tukdon main
 Can take that two-year leave
 magar usee kend sarkaar se niyantrit sarkari bainkon main mahilaon ko maatrutiv avkaash maatr 6 maheene kaa miltaa he
 Why is there such a difference? kya chairman sahab log ek din main mahila bankeron kaa maatrutiv avkaash ken sarkaar main kaam karne vaali mahilaon ke baraabar nahin kar sakate hai
 How is this difference so far
 hamaare enditivi main to ham purushon ko 15 din kaa pitrutv avkaash miltaa he
 The condition of male officers is also bad
 jo sheersh ke do pratishat adhikari hai rizanal head tip unki kaaphi mouj he, magar neeche ke manageron ko raat ke nau nau baje tak bank main rukna padataa he
 After all, how does someone like banking work from ten in the morning to ten in the night
 uski zindagi kya hui phir
 We are also going to discuss the diseases of bank employees separately in this series
 main yah sab ek do shikayaton ke aadhaar par nahin kah rahaa
 Believe it hazaron massej padhe hai
 After that i have prepared this feedback which i am giving to you and the government
 hamaari series ke teen chaar front hai
 Salary is more than that, to get a loan more than that, to sell a bad insurance policy using the trust of the customer
 teesraa he transfar
 There will be many of you who come to know that the insurance policy has been sold without your knowledge
 aap bahut achche dost hai or sahi myne main gandhi ji kii azaadi kaa maan rakhte hai
 You found it right that you are not afraid to name
 hamen sochna hoga ki naukari hamen zindaa rakhane ke liye he yaa maarane ke liye
 There is a lot of tension in our profession as well
 kam tanaav nahin he, lekin banking jaisaa mushkil kaam koi 10 baje subah se raat ke nau baje tak kyon karegaa
 What is the work that cannot be finished in eight hours
 jab se bank afasaron or karmchaariyon se beemaa bikwaaya ja rahaa he, mutual fund bikwaaya ja rahaa he, target ne unki zindagi khatm kar di he
 One should audit how many hours people work in the bank
 ham cross sailing ke liye jo target kaa aatank he us par alag se episod karenge, lekin bainkon ke bheetar ghulaam zindagi par baat bahut zaruri he
 Two things are known from this
 ek ki ham chote bacchon se bhi acha vyavhaar nahin karte hai
 Secondly, hundreds of male and female bankers have complained of this stress of work
 dabaav daalkar lone paas karavaaya ja rahaa he
 This series started with the matter of increasing salary, but looking at all the aspects of it, it seems that this economy is only liberal to say, there is a complete arrangement to keep human being enslaved within it
 ek banker clerk ne bataaya ki notebandi ke dauraan itnaa dabaav tha ki note ginaney main galati ho gai
 When he lost two and a half lakhs, he had to pay the loan alone
 agar saare banker yahi sach bol de ki notebandi ke dauraan hui galatiyon, sade gale noton or jaali noton ke badale kis-kis ne kitna jurmaana bharaa to uski sankhya kai karod main pahunch sakati he
 If a clerk gives two and a half lakh rupees from his pocket, what will be his condition? jabaki uski selary 20,000 bhi nahin hoti he
 All these things have been told by the bankers themselves
 ve bol nahin sakate to unki baton ko feedback ke taur par pesh kar rahaa hum
 If you take a print out of this, ask the above two percent officers and not the remaining 98 percent of the bankers will say yes on one thing
 kahenge ki yahi sahi he
 Mehul Choksi is yet to know which country he is honoring
 unke vakil sanjay eboat ne bataaya he ki mehul ko pratyrpan nideshaalay kaa saman to mila he magar passport radd hone ke kaaran yatra nahin kar sakate hai
 So has the government canceled his passport so that he cannot come to India
 yah khabar khushbu narayan or sadaaf modak kii he
 Printed in the Indian Express
 neerav modi ji bhi bharat bhoomi par abhi tak avatarit nahin hue hai
 Punjab National Bank has told the stock exchange on Monday that Nirav Modi and Mehul Chowksi have committed another fraud of Rs 1322 crore
 ab in donon ke frod ke kaaran punjab neshnal bank ko jo chuunaa laga he uski raashi 12,600 karod ho gai
 From 11,400 crores to 12, 600 crores but Nirav Modi ji has not come
 chaukasee ji kii chaowkee kahaan lagi he kisi ko pataa nahin he
 There is a news on Livemint that Nirav Modi's company Firestar Diamond has applied to be declared bankrupt
 iskaa kaaran bataaya he ki supplai chen main dikkat ho rahi he
 For a long time, the match was running unilaterally, so 97 against Ishmani China Mile Chairman Gurmit Singh Mann, Deputy Managing Director Gurpal Singh and others
 85 karod ke frod kaa cese darj hua he
 The comments gurpal singh punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ke damaad hai
 The Congress Party tweeted and welcomed the move of the CBI and later deleted it
 captain amarinder kaa kahana he ki gurpal singh keval 12
 5% is the shareholder
 unke damaad ko raajnneeti ke tahat khinchaa ja rahaa he
 Even then, the frauds of 12,600 crores are not caught, and if the fraudsters of 97 crores are caught, then that is also fine
 kam se kam yah to rahegaa ki kisi ko bakhsha nahin ja rahaa he
 What happened if the older one is not being caught, the younger one is not being spared
 vitt mantralay ne sabhi bainkon se kaha he ki ve 50 karod se upar ke sabhi enpie khaaton kii jaanch kare, dekhen ki unamem kya frod hua he or sibiai ko report karen
 The work of the CBI also increased, but even if it happened, even though Nirav Modi and Mehul Chauksi are not yet in the grip, once the Bhanda bursts, all the influential people of every party will be defeated but will it happen
 jab tak yah hota he aap una ke is bank kii tasviir dekhie
 Looks like darkness
 yah khuli jagah he
 This bank does not have a toilet
 state bank of india kaa he
 a customer has sent
 iskaa kahana he ki bank ke karmchaariyon ke liye shauchalay nahin he
 Banks should not take this as negative feedback
 bade bade ghotaale ke baad bhi bainkon kii chhavi kharaab nahin hoti to chintaa na karen, shauchalay na hone or aisi jagah main shouch karne kii tasviir se kuch fark nahin padane vaala he
 If the toilet is built here, then the people will praise the bank
 kend sarkaar kii mahilaon ko 180 din kaa maatrutiv avkaash miltaa he

 a banker's clerk said that there was so much pressure during the note ban that there was a mistake in counting the note
 dhai lakh kam hue to use akele lone lekar bharpai kerani padi
 If all the bankers can tell the truth that who has paid a fine in lieu of the mistakes made during the note ban, rotten neck notes and fake notes, then his number can reach several crores
 ek clerk dhai lakh rupee apni jeb se de to uski kya haalat hogi
 While his salary is not even 20,000
 ye sari baaten bankeron ne khud bataai he
 If they cannot speak, then i am presenting their words as feedback

 The reason for this is that the supply chain is facing problems

 His son-in-law is being dragged under politics
 phir bhi 12,600 karod ke fradiye pakad main na aae or uske badale 97 karod kaa frod karne vaale pakadaa jaae to vah bhi thik he
 At least it will remain that no one is being spared
 bade vaale ko pakadaa nahin ja rahaa to kya hua, chote vaale ko bakhsha nahin ja rahaa he
 The Finance Ministry has asked all banks to examine all NPA accounts above Rs 50 crore, see what has been frauded in them and report to the CBI
 sibiai kaa kaam bhi bad gaya lekin agar yah hua to bhale hi neerav modi or mehul chaukasee abhi pakad main nahin aa rahaa he magar ek baar bhanda phute to har dal ke sarvadaleey prabhaavshaalee log dharaa jaaenge lekin kya aisa hoga

 If a clerk gives two and a half lakh rupees from his pocket, what will be his condition? jabaki uski selary 20,000 bhi nahin hoti he
 All these things have been told by the bankers themselves
 ve bol nahin sakate to unki baton ko feedback ke taur par pesh kar rahaa hum
 If you take a print out of this, ask the above two percent officers and not the remaining 98 percent of the bankers will say yes on one thing

 Mehul Choksi is yet to know which country he is honoring
 unke vakil sanjay eboat ne bataaya he ki mehul ko pratyrpan nideshaalay kaa saman to mila he magar passport radd hone ke kaaran yatra nahin kar sakate hai

 Printed in the Indian Express
 neerav modi ji bhi bharat bhoomi par abhi tak avatarit nahin hue hai
 Punjab National Bank has told the stock exchange on Monday that Nirav Modi and Mehul Chowksi have committed another fraud of Rs 1322 crore
 ab in donon ke frod ke kaaran punjab neshnal bank ko jo chuunaa laga he uski raashi 12,600 karod ho gai
 From 11,400 crores to 12, 600 crores but Nirav Modi ji has not come
 chaukasee ji kii chaowkee kahaan lagi he kisi ko pataa nahin he
 There is a news on Livemint that Nirav Modi's company Firestar Diamond has applied to be declared bankrupt
 iskaa kaaran bataaya he ki supplai chen main dikkat ho rahi he
 For a long time, the match was running unilaterally, so 97 against Ishmani China Mile Chairman Gurmit Singh Mann, Deputy Managing Director Gurpal Singh and others
 85 karod ke frod kaa cese darj hua he
 The comments gurpal singh punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ke damaad hai
 The Congress Party tweeted and welcomed the move of the CBI and later deleted it
 captain amarinder kaa kahana he ki gurpal singh keval 12
 5% is the shareholder
 unke damaad ko raajnneeti ke tahat khinchaa ja rahaa he
 Even then, the frauds of 12,600 crores are not caught, and if the fraudsters of 97 crores are caught, then that is also fine
 kam se kam yah to rahegaa ki kisi ko bakhsha nahin ja rahaa he
 What happened if the older one is not being caught, the younger one is not being spared
 vitt mantralay ne sabhi bainkon se kaha he ki ve 50 karod se upar ke sabhi enpie khaaton kii jaanch kare, dekhen ki unamem kya frod hua he or sibiai ko report karen
 The work of the CBI also increased, but even if it happened, even though Nirav Modi and Mehul Chauksi are not yet in the grip, once the Bhanda bursts, all the influential people of every party will be defeated but will it happen

 29 sitambar se hue shuru navaratri (navratri) ke aakhri do dinon main kanya pujan (kanya Pujan) kii parpanra he
 On Ashtami and Navami (durga Navami), the girls are fed on one day
 is daurana unhen uphaar-bhent dena or laal chunari udaana bhi shubh mana jaataa he
 Ashtami i
e
 on 06 October 2019, there are two auspicious auspicious times of Kanya worship: subah 09 bajkar 15 minute se dopaher 12 bajkar 09 minute tak
 Evening auspicious time for Kanya worship on 05th October, 58 minutes from 09:00 to 04 minutes subah 10 bajkar 42 minute se 12 bajkar 09 minute tak
 2
 kanya pujan ke liye sirf 2 se 10 saal tak kii kanyaon ko hi bulaaen
 Because worshiping girls up to two years of age removes sorrow and poverty in the house
 teen saal kii kanya ko poojane se ghar main dhan kii vruddhi hoti he or ghar khushiyaan aati hai
 Worshiping a four-year-old girl leads to the welfare of the family and worshiping a five-year-old girl helps in getting rid of diseases at home
 chah saal kii kanya ghar main vidya laati he, saat saal kii kanya ko poojane se aishwarya miltaa he, aath saal kii kanya ko poojane se kisi bhi vaad-vivaad main viyaj kii prapti hoti he
 Worshiping a nine-year-old girl destroys enemies and by worshiping a ten-year-old girl, all wishes are fulfilled
 3
 Never call girls in force or anger or in haste
 balki ek din pehle kanyaon ko unke ghar jaakar aamantrit karen
 If there is no girl, then let them enter the house with folded hands in the morning
 4
 Clean the house thoroughly before calling the girl
 gande ghar main kanyaon kaa pujan nahin kiya jaataa
 While entering their house, do mother's cheers like: prem se bolo jai mata di Say all, Jai Mata Di milke bolo jai mata di Speak loudly jai mata di laugh sherawali jai mata di Lai wali jai mata di parvat vaali jai mata di5
 After inviting the girls to the house with cheer, spread a clean posture and then wash the feet of the girls
 unke maathe par roli, kumkum or akshat kaa tikaa lagaaein
 6
 kanyaon ke haathon main mauli baandhe
 Perform aarti by showing a lamp of ghee to all the girls
 aarti ke baad kanyaon ko puri, halava or chane kaa bana prasad khilaaen
 Girls do not interrupt them as long as they eat
 7
 Give gifts and gifts to the girls after enjoyment
 aakhir main unke pair chhukar ghar ke baahar tak vidaa karen
 8
 agar aap ashtami yaa navamin vaale din kanya pujan naa kar paaen to navaratri ke har din ek din ek-ek kanya ko pooj sakate hai
 Also, if the number of girls on Ashtami or Navami day is nine or less or more then it does not matter
 9
 Also remember that girls should not only honor them on Ashtami or Navami days, but on every day of the year

 yah dar bhi tha ki congress or aam aadmi party purv sainikon ke andolan ko hathiyaa sakate hai
 Jaitley returned to his office in North Block the same evening and signed the OROP file the next day before flying to Turkey to attend the G20 Finance Ministers' Conference

 Earlier in June 2014, when Jaitley also had the Ministry of Defense, in a meeting with ex-servicemen at his North Block office, he asked them to "lower their expectations"
 unhone kaha tha ki sarkaar pension ke liye 2011 ko aadhaar varsh ke taur par maanegi, na ki 2013-14 kii pension ke paimaanon ko, jaisaa ki purv sainik maang kar rahe the
 This stalemate of the Finance Ministry with the Defense Ministry, which lasted from March to July this year, aroused the anger of the ex-servicemen and they reached Jantar Mantar for a sharp protest

 In early August, when the government suffered embarrassment due to the protests by the ex-servicemen, the Prime Minister's Principal Secretary Nripendra Mishra called for the OROP file and Anurag Jain, Joint Secretary in the PMO, started consultations with the ex-servicemen
 10 agast ko chandrashekhar or purv sena pramukh general veda prakaash malik ko madhyasthata ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 Negotiations failed, as both sides remained adamant: the government was adamant about considering 2011 as the base year; Ex-servicemen remained adamant on implementing the OROP exactly as the Bhagat Singh Koshiyari Committee had reported in the Rajya Sabha in 2011
 yahaan tak ki 27 agast ko sena pramukh general dalbir singh suhaag kaa dakhal bhi kaam nahin aayaa or purv sainik apni maang par tus se mas nahin hue
 The pmo's proposal raised Parrikar's Rs 8,293 crore for OROP
 ke aankade ko kaaphi feekaa kar diya tha
 Informed officials of the negotiations said that after Modi's promise on OROP on 15 August, there was a fundamental difference in the attitude of the government, although he did not talk about it in his Independence Day speech
 ek afasar kehete hai, “sarkaar ne pension dene ke aadhaar varsh ko 2011 se badalakar 2013 kar diya
 “on 30 August, about a week before Parrikar announced his final success, the government had prepared its new account
 ab purv sainikon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ko parrikar ke bayaan main shaamil do baton par sthiti saaf kerani he
 Parrikar had said that premature retirees would not get pension and the pension would be reviewed every five years instead of every year

 Apart from this, Imran also made a statement about the Kashmiri youth
 imran ne kaha ki duniya bhar main swatantraaa sangram kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale islam ko badnaam kiya ja rahaa he
 The accusations of Islam led to the birth of Islamophobia
 khan ne islamophobia ko jammu-kashmir se jodakar kaha ki bharat sarkaar 'islamic aatankwaad' kaa istemaal kar kashmir main logon ko dabaane main lagi hui he
 At the same time, Khan said that the Indian government crushed the Muslims who used the term Islamic terrorism

 We fear that India may take such action one more time

 Annoyed Deputy CM Nitin Patel has taken over the new ministries from today after talking to the high command and the party's national president Amit Shah
 isse pehle manachaaha mantralay na milane se nitin patel naaraaz bataae ja rahe the
 Nitin Patel said on Sunday that after the formation of the government in Gujarat, i have been given the position of deputy CM, keeping him at number-2, but the ministry which was handed over to the leader of the second place was not appropriate
 unhone kaha ki mujhase vitt or shahari vikaas mantralay le liya gaya jo thik nahin he
 In this regard, Nitin had conveyed his complaint to the state CM Vijay Rupani, National President Amit Shah and Organization Minister
 shah se hui phone par batdipti siem nitin patel ne kaha ki aaj subah saadhe saat baje amit bhai ne mujhe phone kar kaha ki aap padbhaar sambhaal lijie
 Nitin said that the party president has assured me that the process of handing over the high-level ministries to me has been started, only after that i have decided to take over the functioning of the ministries
 uthi siem banane kii maangaisse pehle naaraaz nitin patel ne mantri pad kii shapath lene ke baad bhi mantralay nahin sambhala tha
 Even in Mehsana, Patel's supporters had announced a January Kbandh
 saath hi sardaar patel samooh ke sanyojak lalji patel ne shanivaar ko nitin patel ko rajya kaa siem banane kii maang kii thi
 In the previous government, Nitin Patel was given portfolios like Finance and Urban Development while in the new government he has been given the charge of portfolios like Road and Building and Health which are considered less important
 naaraaz nitin patel ko hardik patel ne baghawat kar congress main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa tak de diya tha
 However, Nitin has been rejecting the speculation of leaving the party from the beginning
 kai channelon kii reporton ke mutabik aisa meraa nirdeshon ke tahat hua or kuch rajd samarthakon ne bhi hamalaa kiya, ye puri tarah se avaanchhneeya, niraadhaar or bhraamak he
 We have always been friendly with the media and responded appropriately to them
 
 
 
 i regret and condemn such an incident
 
 
 is tarah kii ghatnaayen nahin honi chahie
 i am personally looking into the matter and conducting an investigation

 People associated with the liquor mafia start working again after a few days

 Ganesh Joshi says that earlier the CO range officer was pressed into the investigation on its complaint
 lekin sharaab mafiaon ke sambandh itane majboot hai ki police ke pahunchane se pehle hi unako soochna praapt ho jaati thi or vahaan se hat jate the
 This shows how strong the mafia's relationship with the police was
 aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne dilli hoicourt main chal rahi sunwaayee par roak lagane kii maang kii he jiske liye supreme court kaa daravaaza khatkhataya gaya he

 The AAP also says that the dispute between the Delhi government and the Center should be heard by the Supreme Court and the court should decide whether Delhi is a state or not
 haalanki chif justise ne kaha he ki agar hoicourt apana faisla sunaata he to supreme court aayaa ja saktaa he, pehle hi hoicourt ke surakshit faisle par roak kyon chaahati he
 The Supreme Court will now hear the case on Monday
 jaisingh ne kaha ki do saal se yah maamla chal rahaa he jisase dilli kaa kaamkaaj prabhavit ho rahaa he
 The High Court has heard several petitions on jurisdiction between the state and the Center
 aap kaa yah bhi kahana he ki dilli sarkaar or centre ke bich kaa vivaad supreme court ko sunanaa chahie or court hi yah faisla de ki dilli rajya he yaa nahin
 Although the Chief Justice has said that if the High Court gives its verdict then the Supreme Court can come, why the High Court already wants to stay the safe verdict
 supreme court ab somvaar ko is maamle kii sunwaayee karegaa

 Dhanush's film is based on Hollywood director Ken Scott's 2014 bestseller book 'the Extra Ordinary Journey of the Fakir'
 film kii khaas baat yah he ki iske nirdeshak ken scot ne 'da extra ordinary jarney of da fakir' main bharat kii garibi ko bhunaane ke bajaay iske human angal par jor diya he
 The film also depicts the problems of refugia as well as love and relationships
 chunki film alag-alag deshon main gumti he isliye isamen alag-alag deshon ke rang bhi hai jo dekhne main kaaphi achche lagate hai
 The cinematography of the film is much better
 is film main dhanush ne apane kirdaar ko achche se nibhaayaa he, saath hi film main kai videshi kalakaar apni-apni bhoomika main khub jame hai
 The film 'the Extra Ordinary Journey of the Fakir' is the story of Ajatshatru Lavash Patel alias Aja, who lives in a Mumbai slum
 ajatshatru bachapan se hi kai dilachasp mode se gujarata he
 However, he has a dream in life that he becomes rich and takes his mother to Paris
 is sapane ko puraa karne ke liye ajatshatru jaadu ke kartab dikhaanaa shuru kar detaa he
 In the film, Aja's mother is single parent, after whose death Aja gets a letter

 Seeing this, Aja sets out on a journey to Paris
 aja kaa yah safar use duniya kii kai dilachasp jagahon ke saath-saath ajeebogareeb logon se bhi milwataa he
 During this journey, Aja is sometimes locked in a cupboard or sometimes locked in a box and goes to different countries
 'da extra ordinary jarney of da fakir' kii kamajori kii agar baat karen to mere hisaab se hindi darshakon ko shaayad ye film bahut zyada aakarshith na kare
 This is because the film lacks entertainment to emotion that attracts Hindi audiences
 aja kaa safar adventures se bharpoor he magar patakatha main aisi koi khaas baat nahin he, jisase darshak achambhit rahen yaa yun kahen ki isamen koi khaas nayaapan nahin he
 The film has an Indian hero, so it also has a dance number, but it is not very strong

 JDU is supporting it
 'unhone kaha ki pehle vaale 'janata dal' se nikle kai dal, jo alag-alag rajyon main acha kaam kar rahe hai, ve bhi gathbandhan ke liye ek-duusare se baatcheet kar rahe hai
 Nitish also said that an alliance can be formed before or after elections

 Ashtanga is especially liked by those who are interested in getting into the depths of Yoga philosophy and spirituality and who have no qualms in going beyond the realm of their peace and comfort

 And yes, 'om!' Do not forget to say
 *** There is no definition of love and that is why it is placed above everything, but does every love begin only by looking at the outer beauty? Most girls think that boys are just crazy about beauty and they think it wrong too
 Not because most boys do this
 kai baar to had tab ho jaati he jab vah paas se nikali aakarshak ladki yaa mahila ko ghur-ghur kar nihaarte hai
 Do such boys succeed in fulfilling the promises of love? Let us know, what is the effect of their age in terms of Ekaladak's emotional and love
 
 
 1
 Boys between 15-25 years of age often draw on the beauty of girls because they lack maturity
 2
 Boys aged 25–30 feel emotionally strong toward girls because they have been in a very bad relationship before
 3
 After passing the age of 30, the boys understand that beauty is not always there, but a sensible partner is always together
 4
 Even at the age of 30, if a boy is single, it does not mean that he is not looking for beauty
 5
 35 cross-casing man seeks a smart woman who can walk in harmony with love and support in his life
 6
 With growing age, the man becomes more intelligent and mature and he starts to understand what his partner wants from him
 7
 Today's boys and men agree completely on how difficult it is to live life without a partner's support, so they look for a sensible partner

 rashtriya lokdal kii ummidavaar tabassum hasan ko samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party or congress ne samarthan diya tha
 The defeat was seen as a major setback for the BJP, which came to power in Uttar Pradesh in 2017 with a thumping majority

 When it came to contesting elections, the opposition showed unity by raising a joint candidate against the BJP

 Under the agreement, the RLD candidate got a chance
 samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party, congress or aam aadmi party ne tabassum ko samarthan kaa elaan kiya
 Since then, the message was that the bjp's Modi magic in the country can be fought by the Grand Alliance

 It is sufficient to prosecute panchayat members

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was busy in a serious meeting with top officials on May 7 in New Delhi with Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 vishay tha bundelkhand main pad rahe jabardast sookhe ke fori upaay khojna
 Prior to this meeting, Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti had a meeting with all the mps of Bundelkhand in NITI Aayog and discussed finding relief measures
 in do baithkon ko milakar april or may main centre or rajya ke bich sheersh str par bundelkhand ke liye chaar baithken huin, lekin inkaa asar ab tak jameen par nahin dikh rahaa he
 On the contrary, the way the central government sent a train to send water from Jhansi to Mahoba and the state government returned it, it was felt that despite the upper level, there is a confrontation between the center and the state
 vaise yah takaraav nayaa bhi nahin he
 From 2005 to 2010, during the period of continuous drought in Bundelkhand, the state and the Center were blaming each other
 isliye teen maheene main chaar baar bundelkhand kaa daura kar chuke akhilesh ne do-took kah diya, “gaanv-gaanv tak pani pahunchane ke liye centre sarkaar agar 10,000 tanker de sakati he to de
 The train has no meaning
 hamaari pani kii yojanaon ko latakaakar centre sarkaar ne bundelkhand se beyimaani kii he
 The central government immediately got the state Rs 10,600 crore
 kaa raahat package de
 "there is also a reason for his shame
 darasal, centre main modi sarkaar banate hi ek bada faisla yah kiya gaya ki rajyon ko centre se milane vittiya mad ko 32 fisadi se badhaakar 42 fisadi kar diya jaae
 Along with increasing the outright money of the states, the Center greatly reduced the financial stake for various projects run in the states
 haalanki uttar pradesh sarkaar kaa daawa he ki pradesh kii hissedari main badhotaree kehane bhar kii he, asal main pichley vitt varsh main uske hisse main centre se 10,000 karod ru
 Few have come
 isi katautee kaa sidhaa asar bundelkhand se judi jal pariyojnaon par padaa
 If we look at the documents of the ongoing water projects in Bundelkhand, the situation becomes more clear
 darasal, akhilesh yadav ne satta sambhalate hi bundelkhand ke krishi or peyajal sankat ke liye badi pariyojnaon kaa khaakaa banaaya
 The Akhilesh government has so far completed nine major dam projects in this area, while work is going on on similar projects, which will be completed by 2018
 uttar pradesh sinchai vibhaag ke pramukh sachiv deepak singhl ne india today ko bataaya, “ye sari pariyojnaayen 7,000 karod ru
 2,200 crore so far and the state government has so far
 kharch kar chuki he
 Since the formation of the Modi government at the Center, these projects have not received any financial support from the Center
 ”sinchai vibhaag ke mutabik, akhilesh sarkaar ne apane kaarykaal main bundelkhand main 8 5,000 hectare sinchai kii kshamta badha lee he, haalanki abhi iskaa asar isliye nahin dikh paaya kyonki lagaataar sookhaa padaa
 From the point of view of statistics, since independence, in 2012, 24 major dams were built in Bundelkhand and Akhilesh government pulled the 75% increase in this structure in four years
 agar centre sarkaar ne bhi madad kii hoti to halaat kuch or hote
 Due to lack of money from the center, dams are ready in many places, but the canals are not coming out
 haalanki kendriya jal sansaadhan mantralay ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya, “uttar pradesh ko bhi usee tarah kendriya madad mil rahi he jaisi baaki rajyon ko mil rahi he
 If a state is working on more projects then it is its responsibility to raise financial resources
 ”yah to baat hui baandh pariyojnaon kii, jinase kheton ko raahat milani he
 But the changed policy of the Center had even more effect on the pipe drinking water projects that supply water to the households in the villages
 pipeline se pani pahunchane kaa jimmaa uttar pradesh jal nigam or jal santhaan kaa he
 These activities are with the Urban Development Minister Azam Khan
 khan kehete hai, “gaanvon main pani pahunchane kii hamaari sari yojanaayen centre se milane vaali vittiya madad se chalati ai hai
 The Modi government cut their budget as soon as they arrived
 aap samajhie ki jal nigam ko centre se kuch nahin mil rahaa he
 The Badshah (narendra Modi) has stopped all plans to supply water to the village
 ” darasal, uttar pradesh main ausatan 17 fisadi gaanvon main pipeline se pani kii supplai hoti he, vahiin bundelkhand main yah ausat 30 fisadi tak he
 In the era of the UPA government, the state government had targeted to connect all villages by pipeline by 2022 and a detailed plan was prepared
 lekin modi sarkaar ke centre main aane ke baad peyajal pariyojnaon ke liye centre sarkaar kaa aavanton kaaphi kam kar diya gaya

 According to Asudani, the Center for Rural Drinking Water across the country has received Rs 9,200 crore in 2014-15

 She left
 jab puure desh main hi gaanv ke pani kaa bajet buree tarah cat gaya to upi bhi iskaa apwaad nahin rahaa
 Uttar Pradesh has raised Rs 11,000 crore in 2015-16 for pipe drinking water projects
 kii yojanaayen bheji thim, lekin centre ne sirf 350 karod ru
 Gave only pichley do vitt varsh main bhi jal nigam ke aavanton main baari katautee kii gai
 Asudani explains, “rs 6,000 crore due to piling up of funds from the center
 kii pehle se manjuur yojanaayen shuru nahin ho paaengi
 Apart from this, the already running Rs 2,800 crore
 kii yojanaayen adhuri rah jaaengi
 The possibility of starting new schemes is also very less
 ”khan kaa kahana he ki agar sookhe ke teen saal main gaanv tak pani pahunchane kii yojanaon ko is tarah band na karvaa diya gaya hota to gaanv main jal sankat se jarur nijaat mili hoti
 By the way, Uma Bharti says that the Center has started the Jal Kranti Yojana, under which the District Magistrate will select two villages in each district
 is yojana par tanj karte hue bundelkhand ke kisaan netaa shivnarayan parihaar poochhate hai, “jhaansi jile main hi 500 gaanv hai, baaki 498 gaanvon ko kya pyaasa chhod diya jayega
 "it is not that the Center is oblivious to this anger rising from the ground
 isiilie niti ayog ne bundelkhand se judi 370 karod ru
 Has approved drinking water projects of Rs
 1,308 crore
 kii 17 pariyojnaon kaa byoraa maanga he, taaki in par kaam shuru ho
 Meanwhile, the UP government has started the procurement of 440 tankers for the area, all these tankers will be available by the middle of June
 haa, rajya sarkaar ne sookhaa raahat ke liye ghoshit 3,537 handpump main se 1,500 handpump jarur laga liye hai
 However, senior officials from both the Center and the state heartily acknowledge that it has been too late to take immediate measures
 agar tanker hi kharidne the to yah kaam farvari se shuru kar diya jaataa or centre se jo paisa ab diya ja rahaa he, vah janvari main jari ho jaataa to may ke ant main raahat par baithkon kii vajah, asal raahat dikhaai de rahi hoti
 By the way, the water train which was supposed to go from Jhansi to Mahoba eventually went to Agra with five lakh liters of water from Bundelkhand
 is train kii tasviren khinchate samay dilli ke ek photo patrkaar ravi kanaujia kii karant lagane se maut ho gai thi
 But the Uttar Pradesh government has given the entire blueprint of the Arjun tributary dam project to the Prime Minister's Principal Secretary Nripendra Mishra to actually deliver the water to the Mahoba to whom the train came
 2,600 karod ru
 So far, about Rs 800 crore on this project
 kharch kiye ja chuke hai, lekin ab bhi 1,800 karod ru
 Is required
 piemo ko die pregentation main baaki jal pariyojnaon kaa bhi vistaar se zikr he
 If these projects are implemented, then Bundelkhand will also be able to stop and spend water in the same way that Israel struggles with waterlogging
 agar sookhe main shuru hui kavayad main lambey samaye se lataki pariyojnaon ko disha or paisa mil jaae to bundelkhand ko dirghakaalik samaadhaan mil saktaa he, kyonki bundelkhand main pichley teen dashakon main 17 baar sookhaa pad chukaa he
 Initiative will have to be erased at some time or the other

 The hard work of Akhilesh Yadav, who emerged as the young face of the politics of Uttar Pradesh, paid off and the mastermind of the politics, who took his first strong step in politics 12 years ago, finally defeated the 'elephant' in the electoral arena by his simple tricks
 Have done my name
 akhilesh kaa janm ek july 1973 ko itawa main hua tha or tab unke pita yuva mulaayam singh yadav pradesh kii raajnneeti main pair jamaa rahe the
 a disciplined father, Mulayam sent him to Dholpur Military School in Rajasthan for his primary education, where after completing his studies, he earned a bachelor's degree in environmental technology from the University of Mysore and a master's degree from Sydney University, Australia
 yuva akhilesh sidney se padhai puri karke pahunche to raajnneeti unki pratiksha kar rahi thi or varsh 2000 main ve pehali baar kannauj loksabhaa seat se upachunaav jeet kar sakriy raajnneeti main kadam rakhaa
 The seat was vacated by the resignation of father Mulayam Singh Yadav, who was elected in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections from Mainpuri and Kannauj two seats
 tab ke baad se akhilesh lagaataar kannauj loksabhaa seat kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe he
 In the midst of increasing age and the increasing disenchantment in national politics, a few years ago, the party chief Yadav put the responsibility of leadership of the party's state unit on the shoulder of young son Akhilesh and what he did well
 16veen vidhansabha ke liye chunaav kii aupchaarik ghoshnaa se pehle hi akhilesh kabhi ‘kranti rath yatra’ to kabhi party ke chunaav chinh cycle se yuvakon or samarthako kii yatraaen nikaal kar puure pradesh ko gaanv gaanv shahar shahar pahunch kar maano math daalaa
 According to party sources, Akhilesh traveled ten thousand kilometers and addressed more than eight hundred rallies in order to establish the party in the state and spread the message of socialism to the people, but there was never a glimpse of fatigue and outrage on his face
 sir par party kii laal topi, safed kurte pyjame par kaale rang kii sadri main sanyat, vinamr magar drudhsankalp bhaashanon ke jariye yuva akhilesh ne dekhte hi dekhte swayan ko pradesh kii raajnneeti kaa sabase janaa pahachaanaa cheharaa bana liya
 He played an important role in the selection of party candidates with a fair sense and by opposing the move to include musclemen like DP Yadav in the party, he showed the necessary decision-making power in politics
 akhilesh ke samajhadaar faislon kaa hi asar tha ki chah march ko vidhansabha chunaav ke liye maton kii ginati shuru hone ke baad se chadhate din ke saath party kii sthiti nirantar majboot hoti gayi, or shaam dhalane tak 403 sadasyeey vidhansabha main party ko 224 siton par jeet ke shandaar bahumat ke saath pradesh ke raajnneetik akaash main ek naye suraj kaa udai ho chukaa tha

 com / siuknikrpz— kiku sharda (@kikusharda)february 22, 2016 Have you heard that any court worker has 'hijacked' the judicial proceedings? This peculiar situation was witnessed in the Tis Hazari court premises last week when a special court hearing corruption cases was recording a statement of a CBI witness from Kolkata through video conferencing and a stenographer suddenly got up from the court saying Gone that she is leaving and waiting for her cab outside
 is harakat ko gambhirtha se lete hue adaalat ne kaha ki mahila stenographer ne 'peeth ke prati anadar' dikhaane kii himakat kii or sunwaayee ke bich main uthakar adaalat ke 'adhikaron ko kamatar' kiya he
 Describing the stenographer's treatment as a "very bad situation", the court said that it had 'hijacked' the video conferencing proceedings in the presence of several lawyers, creating an 'extremely bad image' among the people present there
 stenographer kii harakat ko apane aadesh main darj karte hue nyaayadhish ne kaha ki adaalat ke karmi ne kaarywahi main baadha paidaa kii or kaksh main maujuud peethasin adhikari evam vakeelon ko tab tak vahaan khaali baithe rahanaa padaa jab tak doosraa stenographer nahin pahunch gaya
 The judge said in his written order, "it is pertinent to mention that the court had to wait 5-10 minutes to arrange for another stenographer
" stenographer kii ore se kiye gaye tamaashe ne aisi chhavi pesh kii jaise kaarywahi ko hijank kar liya gaya ho or phir use rokna padaa'
 The incident took place last week, when the stenographer stood up at 4
25 pm and said that she wanted to leave, as her cab was waiting outside
 jab nyaayadhish ne use yaad dilaayaa ki adaalat ke kaam karne kaa samay abhi khatm nahin hua he to usne kaha ki jane se pehle jab tak vah adheekshak ke daftar main hajiri darj karengi, tab tak paanch baj jaaenge
 The judge has conveyed the matter to the District and Sessions Judge so that he can take appropriate action against the stenographer
 tippaniyan The court said, "contempt proceedings of the court could have been initiated to maintain judicial dignity, but this court did not choose this option to maintain judicial restraint and it was considered appropriate to report the matter to the District and Sessions Judge"
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Taking this action seriously, the court said that the female stenographer dared to show 'disrespect towards the back' and had 'undermined the rights' of the court by getting up in the middle of the hearing
 stenographer ke saluk ko 'bahut kharaab sthiti' qaraar dete hue adaalat ne kaha ki kai vakeelon kii maujuudagi main usne video conferencing kaarywahi ko 'hijank' kar liya, jisase vahaan maujuud logon ke bich 'behad buree chhavi' bani
 Entering the stenographer's action in his order, the judge said that the court personnel obstructed the proceedings and the presiding officers and lawyers present in the chamber had to remain vacant till the second stenographer arrived
 nyaayadhish ne apane likhit aadesh main kaha, 'is baat kaa zikr karnaa vaazib he ki duusare stenographer kii vyavastha ke liye adaalat ko 5-10 minute intjaar karnaa padaa
 The spectacle made by the stenographer produced an image as if the proceedings had been hijacked and then had to be stopped '
 yah ghatana pichley hafte hui, jab stenographer shaam chaar bajkar 25 minute par uth khadi hui or kaha ki vah janaa chaahati he, kyonki uski cab baahar intjaar kar rahi he
 When the judge reminded her that the court hours had not yet ended, she said it would be five o'clock by the time she entered the superintendent's office before leaving
 nyaayadhish ne jila evam satr nyaayadhish ko is maamle se avgat kara diya he taaki vah stenographer ke khilaaf uchit karrwai kar saken
 The comments nyaayalay ne kaha, 'nyaayik garima barkaraar rakhane ke liye adaalat kii avmaananaa kii kaarywahi shuru kii ja sakati thi, lekin nyaayik sanyam barkaraar rakhane kii khatir is adaalat ne yah vikalp nahin chunaa or maamle kii jaankaree jila evam satr nyaayadhish ko dena uchit samajha'
