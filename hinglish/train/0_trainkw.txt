 Senior Congress leader and Union Minister Beni Prasad Verma, who targeted his own party leaders along with Mulayam Singh Yadav and Narendra Modi, created panic in the UP Congress on Friday

 After Beni's statement, Congress Legislature Party leader Pradeep Mathur said that if Dr
 khatri ko bhavishya main hataae jane kaa koi faisla hua bhi ho to unhen is tarah saarvajanik rup se uski ghoshnaa nahin kerani chahie
 Such rhetoric hurts the party
 unhone jor dekar kaha ki vaise jahaan tak meri jaankaree he, khatri ko hataae jane kaa koi faisla nahin kiya gaya he
 What can be said about Beni Verma's formula
 vaise haikaman kaa jo bhi nirnay hoga, vah sabhi ko sweekaar hoga

 bijepi pravaktaa shahanvaj hossain ke saath charchaa ke dauraan ovaisi ne kaha ki desh ke itihaas main chaar aisi ghatnaayen hui hai, jise kisi ko nahin bhoolaana chahie
 Owaisi said that the country should never forget the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, the killing of Sikhs on the streets of Delhi in 1984, the demolition of Babri and what happened in Gujarat in 2002

 Owaisi said that Modi is the only one responsible for the Rafale deal, Modi is petrol, diesel, dollar, Akhlaq, Junaid, mob lynching
 desh main jo bhi kharaab he uske liye narendra modi hi jimmedaar hai
 Shahnawaz Hussain counterattacked on these allegations of Asaduddin Owaisi

 Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf was arrested from his farmhouse and remanded in custody for two days in a case relating to the dismissal of judges

 After the arrest, Pervez Musharraf alleges that all this action against him is politically motivated
 ek din pehle hi adaalat ne unki agrim jamaanat jab radd kii thi to giraftaar se bachane ke liye vah naatakeey tareeke se adaalat parisar se chalate bane the
 Police officials arrested the 69-year-old former military ruler this morning and took him to the court of judicial magistrate Mohammad Abbas Shah
 musharraf ke vakeelon or purv sainya shaasha ke khilaaf yachikaayen daakhil karne vaale kai logon ke vakil kii daleelein sunne ke baad nyaayadhish ne purv sena pramukh ko do din kii ‘transit hiraasat’ main bhej diya
 The judge also ordered the police to produce Musharraf in an anti-terrorism court in two days as the Islamabad High Court on Thursday ordered authorities to impose an emergency on the former military ruler in 2007 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act Be charged nyaayadhish ke aadesh ke khilaaf musharraf supreme court main apil kar sakate hai
 The Islamabad High Court on Thursday accused the former military ruler of not cooperating with police officers in the investigation of a case registered against Musharraf for detaining dozens of judges, including Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary, during the Emergency in 2007
 Arrest orders were made
 aaj unhen giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Television footage showed dozens of policemen and paramilitary personnel carrying Musharraf to the small office of the judge
 footage main salwar kameez or jacket pahane musharraf pareshaan dikh rahe hai
 He is also seen leaving the judge's office and heading towards his car
 car main musharraf ne kuch der intjaar kiya, kyonki nyaayadhish ne shuru main apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 Shortly before 9:15 in the morning, the judge issued an order for Musharraf's arrest, but before that Musharraf left for the farmhouse with his security squad
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki musharraf ko islamabad ke bahari hisse main chak shahzad sthit unke farm house main hiraasat main rakhaa jayega
 According to him, Musharraf's life is in danger so he cannot be sent to jail
 purv main nyaayadhish se police adhikariyon ne kaha ki unhen musharraf kii hiraasat kii jarurat nahin he or unhen nyaayik hiraasat main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 However, lawyers of several people who had filed petitions against Musharraf for enforcing the Emergency and detaining more than 60 members of the Supreme Judiciary in 2007, insisted on Musharraf being placed in police custody
 in vakeelon ne yah bhi sawaal kiya ki musharraf ko police ne giraftaar karne ke baad hathkadiyaan kyon nahin lagaayee
 Musharraf's lawyer Qamar Afzal argued that his client should be kept in judicial custody as his (musharraf's) life is in grave danger
 sutron ne bataaya ki praadhikariyon ne musharraf ko nyaayik hiraasat main rakhe jane ke liye kaha tha, kyonki aisa karne par islamabad kaa prashasan chak shahzad sthit unke farm house ko ‘up jail’ ghoshit kar vahaan purv sainya shaasha ko hiraasat main rakh sakegaa
 Authorities are putting more emphasis on this measure, because the authorities do not want to keep him in jail because of the threat to Musharraf's life
 guuruuvaar ko nyaayamurti shaukat ajij siddiqui ne jaise hi musharraf kii agrim jamaanat radd kii or police ko unhen hiraasat main lene kaa aadesh diya, usee samay musharraf or unke surakshakarmi islamabad hoicourt se nikalakar sidhe farmahouse kii ore ravaanaa ho gaye the
 Today Musharraf was arrested
 musharraf ke vakil guuruuvaar ko supreme court main apil daayar nahin kar sake, kyonki sarvocch adaalat ke band hone se pehle tak vah kuch jaruri aupchaariktaayen puri nahin kar paae the
 Analysts say Musharraf's arrest could lead to a confrontation between the judiciary and the powerful army, as the military would not like to see its former chief publicly humiliated
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki agar musharraf ke khilaaf sunwaayee kii jaati he to sena pramukh general ashfak parvej kayaani sahit vartmaan sainya netritv ke kai sadasyon ko maamle main khinchaa ja saktaa he
 These people were among those close to him when Musharraf imposed the Emergency in 2007
 tippaniyan Musharraf returned to the country last year after being in self-exile for nearly four years
 tab se unhen kai kanoonee samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Earlier this week Musharraf was disqualified to contest the general elections due next month
 isi ke saath hi raajnneetik vaapasi kii unki mahatvakanksha par bhi viraam lag gaya
 Authorities have also banned his exit from Pakistan
 giraftaar ke baad parvej musharraf kaa aarope he ki unke khilaaf yah sari karrwai raajnneeti se prerit he
 a day earlier, when the court canceled his anticipatory bail, he walked dramatically from the court premises to avoid arrest
 police adhikariyon ne 69 varshiya purv sainya shaasha ko aaj subah giraftaar kiya or unhen nyaayik magistrate mohammad abbaas shah kii adaalat le gaye
 The judge sent the former army chief into two-day 'transit custody' after hearing the arguments of the lawyers of Musharraf and several people who had filed petitions against the former military ruler
 nyaayadhish ne police ko yah bhi aadesh diya ki musharraf ko do din main aatankwaad nirodhak adaalat main pesh kiya jaae kyonki islamabad hoicourt ne guuruuvaar ko praadhikariyon ko aadesh diya tha ki purv sainya shaasha par varsh 2007 main apatkaal lagu karne ke liye aatankwaad nirodhak kanoon ke tahat aarope lagaae jaaen
 Musharraf can appeal in the Supreme Court against the judge's order
 varsh 2007 main apatkaal ke dauraan supremecourt ke pradhan nyaayamurti iftikhar choudhary sahit darjanon nyaayadhishon ko hiraasat main rakhane ke liye musharraf ke khilaaf darj ek maamle kii jaanch main police adhikariyon ke saath sahyog na karne ke aarope main islamabad hai court ne guuruuvaar ko purv sainya shaasha kii giraftaar ke aadesh die the
 Today he was arrested
 televijan par dikhaae gaye footage main darjanon pulicekarmi or ardhsainik bal ke jawan musharraf ko nyaayadhish ke chote se karyaalay main le jate najar aa rahe hai
 In the footage, Musharraf is seen troubled wearing a salwar kameez and jacket
 vah nyaayadhish ke karyaalay se nikalakar apni car kii ore jate bhi najar aa rahe hai
 Musharraf waited for a while in the car as the judge initially reserved his verdict
 subah 9 bajkar 15 minute se kuch hi pehle nyaayadhish ne musharraf kii giraftaar kaa aadesh jari kiya, lekin usase pehle musharraf apane suraksha daste ke saath farmahouse ravaanaa ho chuke the
 Officials said Musharraf would be detained at his farm house in Chak Shahzad on the outskirts of Islamabad
 unke anusaar, musharraf kii jaan ko khatra he isliye unhen jail nahin bheja ja saktaa
 Police officials previously told the judge that they did not need Musharraf's custody and could be held in judicial custody
 baharhaal, un kai logon ke vakeelon ne musharraf ko police hiraasat main rakhe jane par jor diya jin logon ne varsh 2007 main apatkaal lagu karne or sarvocch nyaaypalika ke 60 se adhik sadasyon ko hiraasat main rakhe jane ko lekar musharraf ke khilaaf yachikaayen daayar kii thim
 These lawyers also questioned why the police did not handcuff Musharraf after his arrest
 musharraf ke vakil qamar afjal ne tark diya ki unke muvakkil ko nyaayik hiraasat main rakhaa janaa chahie kyonki unki (musharraf kii) jaan ko gambhir khatra he
 Sources said the authorities had asked for Musharraf to be placed in judicial custody as doing so, the Islamabad administration would declare his farm house in Chak Shahzad a 'sub jail' and keep the former military ruler in custody there
 praadhikari isi upaay par adhik jor de rahe hai, kyonki musharraf kii jaan ko khatra dekhte hue adhikari unhen jail main nahin rakhana chaahate
 As soon as Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui canceled Musharraf's anticipatory bail on Thursday and ordered the police to detain him, Musharraf and his security personnel left the Islamabad High Court and headed straight to the farmhouse
 aaj musharraf ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Musharraf's lawyers could not file an appeal in the Supreme Court on Thursday, as they had not completed some necessary formalities before the Supreme Court closed
 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki musharraf kii giraftaar se nyaaypalika or shaktishaalee sena ke bich takaraav ho saktaa he, kyonki sena apane purv pramukh ko saarvajanik rup se apamaanit hote nahin dekhnaa chaahegi
 He also said that several members of the current military leadership, including Army Chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, could be drawn in the case if a hearing is held against Musharraf
 musharraf ne varsh 2007 main jab apatkaal lagu kiya tha tab unke karibiyon main ye log shaamil the
 The comments kareeb chaar saal tak aatmanirvaasan main rahane ke baad musharraf pichley saal desh laute hai
 Since then he has been facing many legal problems
 is saptaah ke shuru main musharraf, agle maah hone ja rahe aam chunaav ladane ke liye ayogy ghoshit kar die gaye
 At the same time, his ambition for political withdrawal also came to an end
 adhikariyon ne unke pakistan se baahar jane par roak bhi laga di he
 a day earlier, when the court canceled his anticipatory bail, he walked dramatically from the court premises to avoid arrest

 unke anusaar, musharraf kii jaan ko khatra he isliye unhen jail nahin bheja ja saktaa
 Police officials previously told the judge that they did not need Musharraf's custody and could be held in judicial custody
 baharhaal, un kai logon ke vakeelon ne musharraf ko police hiraasat main rakhe jane par jor diya jin logon ne varsh 2007 main apatkaal lagu karne or sarvocch nyaaypalika ke 60 se adhik sadasyon ko hiraasat main rakhe jane ko lekar musharraf ke khilaaf yachikaayen daayar kii thim
 These lawyers also questioned why the police did not handcuff Musharraf after his arrest
 musharraf ke vakil qamar afjal ne tark diya ki unke muvakkil ko nyaayik hiraasat main rakhaa janaa chahie kyonki unki (musharraf kii) jaan ko gambhir khatra he
 Sources said the authorities had asked for Musharraf to be placed in judicial custody as doing so, the Islamabad administration would declare his farm house in Chak Shahzad a 'sub jail' and keep the former military ruler in custody there
 praadhikari isi upaay par adhik jor de rahe hai, kyonki musharraf kii jaan ko khatra dekhte hue adhikari unhen jail main nahin rakhana chaahate
 As soon as Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui canceled Musharraf's anticipatory bail on Thursday and ordered the police to detain him, Musharraf and his security personnel left the Islamabad High Court and headed straight to the farmhouse
 aaj musharraf ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Musharraf's lawyers could not file an appeal in the Supreme Court on Thursday, as they had not completed some necessary formalities before the Supreme Court closed
 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki musharraf kii giraftaar se nyaaypalika or shaktishaalee sena ke bich takaraav ho saktaa he, kyonki sena apane purv pramukh ko saarvajanik rup se apamaanit hote nahin dekhnaa chaahegi
 He also said that several members of the current military leadership, including Army Chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, could be drawn in the case if a hearing is held against Musharraf
 musharraf ne varsh 2007 main jab apatkaal lagu kiya tha tab unke karibiyon main ye log shaamil the
 The comments kareeb chaar saal tak aatmanirvaasan main rahane ke baad musharraf pichley saal desh laute hai
 Since then he has been facing many legal problems
 is saptaah ke shuru main musharraf, agle maah hone ja rahe aam chunaav ladane ke liye ayogy ghoshit kar die gaye
 At the same time, his ambition for political withdrawal also came to an end
 adhikariyon ne unke pakistan se baahar jane par roak bhi laga di he
 Police officials arrested the 69-year-old former military ruler this morning and took him to the court of judicial magistrate Mohammad Abbas Shah
 musharraf ke vakeelon or purv sainya shaasha ke khilaaf yachikaayen daakhil karne vaale kai logon ke vakil kii daleelein sunne ke baad nyaayadhish ne purv sena pramukh ko do din kii ‘transit hiraasat’ main bhej diya
 The judge also ordered the police to produce Musharraf in an anti-terrorism court in two days as the Islamabad High Court on Thursday ordered authorities to impose an emergency on the former military ruler in 2007 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act Be charged nyaayadhish ke aadesh ke khilaaf musharraf supreme court main apil kar sakate hai
 The Islamabad High Court on Thursday accused the former military ruler of not cooperating with police officers in the investigation of a case registered against Musharraf for detaining dozens of judges, including Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary, during the Emergency in 2007
 Arrest orders were made
 aaj unhen giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Television footage showed dozens of policemen and paramilitary personnel carrying Musharraf to the small office of the judge
 footage main salwar kameez or jacket pahane musharraf pareshaan dikh rahe hai
 He is also seen leaving the judge's office and heading towards his car
 car main musharraf ne kuch der intjaar kiya, kyonki nyaayadhish ne shuru main apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 Shortly before 9:15 in the morning, the judge issued an order for Musharraf's arrest, but before that Musharraf left for the farmhouse with his security squad
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki musharraf ko islamabad ke bahari hisse main chak shahzad sthit unke farm house main hiraasat main rakhaa jayega
 According to him, Musharraf's life is in danger so he cannot be sent to jail
 purv main nyaayadhish se police adhikariyon ne kaha ki unhen musharraf kii hiraasat kii jarurat nahin he or unhen nyaayik hiraasat main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 However, lawyers of several people who had filed petitions against Musharraf for enforcing the Emergency and detaining more than 60 members of the Supreme Judiciary in 2007, insisted on Musharraf being placed in police custody
 in vakeelon ne yah bhi sawaal kiya ki musharraf ko police ne giraftaar karne ke baad hathkadiyaan kyon nahin lagaayee
 Musharraf's lawyer Qamar Afzal argued that his client should be kept in judicial custody as his (musharraf's) life is in grave danger
 sutron ne bataaya ki praadhikariyon ne musharraf ko nyaayik hiraasat main rakhe jane ke liye kaha tha, kyonki aisa karne par islamabad kaa prashasan chak shahzad sthit unke farm house ko ‘up jail’ ghoshit kar vahaan purv sainya shaasha ko hiraasat main rakh sakegaa
 Authorities are putting more emphasis on this measure, because the authorities do not want to keep him in jail because of the threat to Musharraf's life
 guuruuvaar ko nyaayamurti shaukat ajij siddiqui ne jaise hi musharraf kii agrim jamaanat radd kii or police ko unhen hiraasat main lene kaa aadesh diya, usee samay musharraf or unke surakshakarmi islamabad hoicourt se nikalakar sidhe farmahouse kii ore ravaanaa ho gaye the
 Today Musharraf was arrested
 musharraf ke vakil guuruuvaar ko supreme court main apil daayar nahin kar sake, kyonki sarvocch adaalat ke band hone se pehle tak vah kuch jaruri aupchaariktaayen puri nahin kar paae the
 Analysts say Musharraf's arrest could lead to a confrontation between the judiciary and the powerful army, as the military would not like to see its former chief publicly humiliated
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki agar musharraf ke khilaaf sunwaayee kii jaati he to sena pramukh general ashfak parvej kayaani sahit vartmaan sainya netritv ke kai sadasyon ko maamle main khinchaa ja saktaa he
 These people were among those close to him when Musharraf imposed the Emergency in 2007
 tippaniyan Musharraf returned to the country last year after being in self-exile for nearly four years
 tab se unhen kai kanoonee samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Earlier this week Musharraf was disqualified to contest the general elections due next month
 isi ke saath hi raajnneetik vaapasi kii unki mahatvakanksha par bhi viraam lag gaya
 Authorities have also banned his exit from Pakistan

 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki musharraf kii giraftaar se nyaaypalika or shaktishaalee sena ke bich takaraav ho saktaa he, kyonki sena apane purv pramukh ko saarvajanik rup se apamaanit hote nahin dekhnaa chaahegi
 He also said that several members of the current military leadership, including Army Chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, could be drawn in the case if a hearing is held against Musharraf
 musharraf ne varsh 2007 main jab apatkaal lagu kiya tha tab unke karibiyon main ye log shaamil the
 The comments kareeb chaar saal tak aatmanirvaasan main rahane ke baad musharraf pichley saal desh laute hai
 Since then he has been facing many legal problems
 is saptaah ke shuru main musharraf, agle maah hone ja rahe aam chunaav ladane ke liye ayogy ghoshit kar die gaye
 At the same time, his ambition for political withdrawal also came to an end
 adhikariyon ne unke pakistan se baahar jane par roak bhi laga di he
 These lawyers also questioned why the police did not handcuff Musharraf after his arrest
 musharraf ke vakil qamar afjal ne tark diya ki unke muvakkil ko nyaayik hiraasat main rakhaa janaa chahie kyonki unki (musharraf kii) jaan ko gambhir khatra he
 Sources said the authorities had asked for Musharraf to be placed in judicial custody as doing so, the Islamabad administration would declare his farm house in Chak Shahzad a 'sub jail' and keep the former military ruler in custody there
 praadhikari isi upaay par adhik jor de rahe hai, kyonki musharraf kii jaan ko khatra dekhte hue adhikari unhen jail main nahin rakhana chaahate
 As soon as Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui canceled Musharraf's anticipatory bail on Thursday and ordered the police to detain him, Musharraf and his security personnel left the Islamabad High Court and headed straight to the farmhouse

 adhikariyon ne unke pakistan se baahar jane par roak bhi laga di he
 Musharraf's lawyer Qamar Afzal argued that his client should be kept in judicial custody as his (musharraf's) life is in grave danger
 sutron ne bataaya ki praadhikariyon ne musharraf ko nyaayik hiraasat main rakhe jane ke liye kaha tha, kyonki aisa karne par islamabad kaa prashasan chak shahzad sthit unke farm house ko ‘up jail’ ghoshit kar vahaan purv sainya shaasha ko hiraasat main rakh sakegaa
 Authorities are putting more emphasis on this measure, because the authorities do not want to keep him in jail because of the threat to Musharraf's life
 guuruuvaar ko nyaayamurti shaukat ajij siddiqui ne jaise hi musharraf kii agrim jamaanat radd kii or police ko unhen hiraasat main lene kaa aadesh diya, usee samay musharraf or unke surakshakarmi islamabad hoicourt se nikalakar sidhe farmahouse kii ore ravaanaa ho gaye the

 musharraf ke vakil guuruuvaar ko supreme court main apil daayar nahin kar sake, kyonki sarvocch adaalat ke band hone se pehle tak vah kuch jaruri aupchaariktaayen puri nahin kar paae the
 Analysts say Musharraf's arrest could lead to a confrontation between the judiciary and the powerful army, as the military would not like to see its former chief publicly humiliated
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki agar musharraf ke khilaaf sunwaayee kii jaati he to sena pramukh general ashfak parvej kayaani sahit vartmaan sainya netritv ke kai sadasyon ko maamle main khinchaa ja saktaa he
 These people were among those close to him when Musharraf imposed the Emergency in 2007
 tippaniyan Musharraf returned to the country last year after being in self-exile for nearly four years
 tab se unhen kai kanoonee samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he

 She then went to the computer department for revision (the decision was available online anyway)

 Once the judge decided that all the revisions were done sequentially, he would sign the order of release

 There was another problem about which the clerks of the court came to know — there was a strike of lawyers

 Five years ago, on the first day of hearing of the Talwar couple, when i was stationed with my notebook, i heard an announcement made in a soft voice
 court kii kaarywahi file karne kii ummiido par pani phir gaya
 On that day a member of the Ghaziabad Bar died untimely due to which the court work was stopped

 She was to the delight of the Talwar couple that Judge Chaudhary was available there and after a brief debate the clerks sent Matter to them
 unhone kareeb teen baje rihaai ke aadesh par dastakhat kiye
 This was the fourth day after the Talwar couple was acquitted from the Allahabad High Court

 After getting acquainted with the route and taking several rounds, all the chaos started to feel comfortable

 It may be that five years ago there was a promotion of an educational institution on hoardings, on which it is written that the government has recognized it under 'B' category

 During the hearing of the Talwar couple, such views used to be a little comforting in the midst of everyday injustice in the court

 After raising the Ram temple issue, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seems to be in a mood to make Laxman's statue in Lucknow a political issue ahead of the 2019 general elections
 lakhanu ke lakshmana kaa tila vaala ilaaka jo ki ab tile vaali masjid ke naam se jaani jaati he
 There, a controversy has erupted over the installation of a large statue of Lord Rama's younger brother Laxman
 bijepi ko is vivaad main 2019 kii siyaasi fasal main vot dikhaai de rahaa he to sapa or basapa jaisi partiyaan is vivaad se khud ko dur rakhana behatar samaj rahi hai
 But the statements coming from Muslim clerics and religious leaders are becoming very favorable for the bjp's politics
 lakhanu nagar nigam main bijepi kaa varchasv he
 Mayor Samyukta Bhatia comes from the RSS family
 ve lakhanu ke tile vaali masjid ke paas nagar nigam kii jameen par lakshmana kii bhavy pratimaa banane kii himachati hai
 There is bound to be a dispute over this decision first and now politics too
 bataa den ki bijepi ke do parshadon rajnish gupta or ramakrishna yadav ne tile vaali masjid ke paas nagar nigam kii jameen par lakshmana kii badi pratimaa lagaae jane kaa prastaav rakhaa to bijepi kii meyar sanyukta bhaatia ne ise khulaa samarthan de diya
 However, the Muslim side also left no stone unturned to raise the issue
 is kadi main sabase pehle tile vaali masjid ke imam ne iskaa virodh kiya phir shiya or sunni moulana ne yah kah kar virodh kiya ki yahaan par lakshmana kii pratimaa lagaae jane se tanaav or vivaad hoga
 Significantly, Lucknow has been known as the city of Lakshmana, in mythological texts it is called the city of Lakshmana
 bijepi ke diggaj netaa or atal bihari vaajapeyi ke sabase kareebi maane jane vaale lalji tandon ne apni kitaab main tile vaali masjid ke neeche lakshmana kii gupha kaa zikr kar chuke hai
 Hinduist organizations have already claimed the mounded mosque to be Laxman's cave
 itnaa hi nahin ve to mandir ko dhwast karke vahaan masjid banane kaa aarope lagaate rahe hai
 Although the Municipal Corporation wants to install the statue of Laxman at a municipal park or intersection, a little away from the mound area, but the statements from the Muslim clerics are appealing to the BJP
 jabaki muslimon kii hitaishi maane jane vaali samaajawaadee party or bispi is maamle par rahasyamai chuppi saadh rakhi he
 According to BJP spokesperson Manish Shukla, Lucknow has been called the city of Laxman
 ve kehete hai ki aasthaa ke taur par bhi log ise lakshmana kii nagari kehete hai
 In such a situation, if there is a proposal to install the statue of Laxman on some municipal corporation land, then there is nothing wrong in this
 vahiin bijepi kii meyar sanyukta bhaatia har haal main lakshmana kii murti lagane par amada he vah kahati hai ki haalanki abhi prastaav par aakhri faisla nahin hua he lekin ham murti jarur lagaayenge
 The BJP is sure to be politicized to install the idol of Laxman
 aane vaale kuch hafton main lakhanu main lakshmana kii pratimaa ko lekar vivaad bad saktaa he, kyonki nagar nigam ise apane general body meeting main jald hi paas karegaa
 Tell that Kilkenau is also known as Lakhan Pasike town in addition to the city of Laxman
 lakhan paasi daliton ke raja or ilaake ke bade ladke ke taur par mashhoor rahe hai
 While Hinduists consider it the city of Lakshmana, the same Dalit calls it the city of Lakhan Pasi
 aise main BJP is mudde ko banane main koi kor kasar nahin chhod rahi he

 Film: Love Yatra Director: Abhiraj meenawalaartist: Ayush Sharma, Varina Hussain, Ram Kapoor, Ronit Roysamayavadhi: 2 hours 20 minutescertification: UA Stars: 2 Director Abhiraj Meenawala has previously worked with Salman Khan in a film like "sultan"
 haalanki lavayatri se pehle meenavala ne koi unhon film nirdeshit nahin kiya he
 He used to work for the Yash Raj banner
 is baar unhone salmaan khan production kii film ke liye aayush sharma or varina hossain ko nirdeshit karne kii koshish kii he
 Ram Kapoor and Ronit Roy also play important roles in the film
 aakhirkaar meenavala ne apni debyue film lavayatri he kisi banaai he, aaie samiksha karte hai
 
 
 The story of the film is based in Gujarat where Sushruta (ayush Sharma) is a Garba teacher
 wo navaratri se pehle logon ko garba sikhaaya karte hai
 Meanwhile, NRI Mitchell (varina Hussain) enters from London
 mishael ke pyaar main sushrut pad jaataa he
 Sushruta falls for Michelle very much
 isi bich mishael landan waapas laut jaati he or phir mishael kii talash main sushrut landan tak pahunchataa he
 Twist turns occur in the story
 film kii kahani main ek taraf sushrut ke papa yani ram kapur hai to duusari taraf varina ke papa ronit hai
 The family stands in love with both
 kya sushrut or mishael kii jodi mil paati he
 Ultimately, what happens, how the story moves forward, you will have to watch the film
 film kii kamjor kadifilm kii likhaawat kaaphi kamjor he
 Screen play in particular is clichéd
 ise durust kiya ja saktaa tha
 Ayush and Varina have come as debutants, but they have not got a good story
 is vajah se kuch bhi "out of da box" dekhne ko nahin miltaa he
 At the same time the work of the director is also loose
 abhiraj or bhi behatar nirdesan kar sakate the
 The plot of the film was very good
 ek acchhee kahani ban sakati thi, lekin wo cheez saamne najar nahin ai
 The actors' location and dialogue of the film are also not of a high way
 is vajah se second half ke baad film or kamjor lagane lagati he
 If Ayush and Varina got a good script in a debut film, it could have been a good film
 abhiraj jo bananaa chaah rahe the wo saamne najar nahin aayaa
 The film was promoted very well
 par kamjor film hone kii vajah se aakraamak pramotion kaa bahut phayda film ko nahin milegaa
 In a way, the film with a fairly loose script is Lavayatri
 aayush or varina ne ausat pradarshan kiya he
 Arbaaz and Sohail are doing fine in the rest of the film's cameos
 ram kapoororaronitkaa bhi abhinay apni jagah kuch had tak thik najar aata he
 a good thing about the film is its songs
 gane relies se pehle hit hue hai
 The budget of the box office film is said to be around 20 crores
 ise salmaan khan ke production ne banaaya he, acchhee khaasi screens milane vaali he
 Looking at the way the film is made, it seems that its journey to the box office after the weekend can be quite weak

 The RSS has published an article in its mouthpiece Organizer
 lekh kaa vishaleshan karne waalon ko lagatahe ki sangh iske madhyam sebijapi yaa kiran bedi par dabaav bananachahta he
 The Sangh believes that in the Delhi elections, the BJP was nervous about the ground reality
 bijepi sanghathan ne pehle dilli kii janata se feedback liya
 And then Kiran Bedi was made the CM candidate
 kya orgeniser main chape lekh kaa matlab yenikala jaae ki bijepi or kiran bedi ko phir se apane kaam kii samiksha kerani hogi?bijepi main shaamil hone ke teen din baad 18 janvari ko party ne kiran bedi ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya tha
 There were also reports of Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat being angry
 lekin is baat ke mahaj chaar din baad hi kiran bedi ne sangh kii tarif main kaside padhe the
 He described the Sangh as a nationalist organization
 kaha tha ki sangh ne desh ko ekta main baandh rakhaa he
 Bedi's statement was seen as an attempt to sway the Sangh
 darasal, bedi ne bhagava party kaa daaman to tham liya lekin unki kai aisi bate hai jo sangh ko pansad nahin aa rahi hai
 For example
 
 
 1
 Kiran Bedi has no connection with the union
 iske ulat ve team anna ke ranneetikaron main se ek rahi hai
 2
 bijepi ke kendriya netritv ne sangh se jude kai bijepi netaaon ko darkinar kar unhen mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar bana diya
 There is an internal atmosphere against him in the BJP
 3
 BJP leaders get education to work in Sangh school, but Bedi's style of working is still police
 aise main donon main talmail nahin ban rahaa he
 4
 bijepi sanghathan main kaam karne vaale adhiktar bade netaa yaa mukhyamantri padon ke ummidavaar sangh ke raste hi party main aate hai
 They have a good knowledge of the party's policy and direction
 lekin kiran bedi ke saath aisa kuch nahin he5
 65-year-old Kiran Bedi may have spent her life in public service, but she seems to have a weak grip on politics
 6
 During the election campaign, Kiran Bedi seems unsuccessful in giving an effective response to the opposition
 sangh kii najar bhaajapa or bedi donon par he
 In this article of Organizer, he may have pulled the BJP over Kiran Bedi, but the pressure has also been put on Kiran Bedi
 vakt he, ve kuch kar dikhaaen

 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bhartiya janata party or congress ke bich talavaarein khinch gai hai
 On behalf of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has been challenged to contest from Amethi again
 BJP netaa jiviel narsimha raav kaa kahana he ki rahul gandhi har baar samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ke ummidavaar naa khadaa karne kii vajah se jitate aae hai
 He said that we challenge him to contest from Amethi itself
 gauratlab he ki priyanka gandhi wadra kii raajnneeti main aadhikarik entry ke baad se hi is prakaar ke kayaas lagaae jane lage hai ki vah khud amethi se chunaav lard sakati hai
 In such a situation, Rahul Gandhi can change his parliamentary constituency
 kuch media reports main is prakaar kaa bhi daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki rahul raibareli yaa phir madhya pradesh kii chhindwara loksabhaa seat se 2019 main apni kismat aajamaa sakate hai
 Let me tell you that Amethi Lok Sabha seat is the stronghold of Gandhi family
 rahul gandhi 2004 ke baad se hi amethi se saansad hai
 But in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP fielded Smriti Irani from here, then Narendra Modi himself addressed a public meeting against Rahul Gandhi here
 smriti irani ne 2014 ke chunaav main rahul gandhi ko kadi takkar di thi
 Smriti Irani has been active in Amethi since losing the election, she has visited here many times
 lagaataar vah sthaneey logon se samvaad karti rahi hai, aise main kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki ek baar phir rahul gandhi ko smriti irani kadi takkar de sakati hai

 You will be able to use more than one smartphone at the same time! whatsapp can soon give users multiple device support
 kuch samay pehle hi wabetainfo kii report main kaha gaya tha ki company isaki testing kar rahi he
 According to a report in the same blog, whatsapp Beta version 2

 Under this new multi-platform feature, you will get the facility to log in with a whatsapp account on different devices
 ab tak aap ek watsap acount sirf ek hi smartphone main yuj kar sakate hai
 However there is still whatsapp web which can be used simultaneously with mobile
 wabetainfo kii ek report ke mutabik is beta varjan main ek registration yaa veriphication code kaa opshan dekha gaya he
 That is, whenever you try to log whatsapp from another device, you will be asked for a registration or verification code
 isi tarah kaa registration or veriphication tab bhi milegaa jab yujar ek saath ek se zyada divaais main log in karegaa
 Significantly, this whatsapp policy under which an account can be used in only one phone at a time, is very important in terms of security
 kyonki is tarah hekking kaa khatra kaaphi kam hota he
 So even if the company brings this feature, then there will be a very intensive testing process before it
 whatsapp kaa multiple divaais saport kii tarah hi dark mod aisa feechar he jiske liye yugers kaaphi samay se intjaar kar rahe hai
 Although the company has not said anything about the Dark Mode till now, but information related to this is coming from time to time and screenshots have also been leaked

 The incident is in the summer of 1990

 The Cold War was over, the Berlin Wall collapsed and the Soviet Union collapsed
 usee saal may main ek ke baad ek kai ghatnaon se america ko lagane laga ki dakshin asia main parmaanu shakti banane kaa utavlaapan teji se bad rahaa he
 a large number of Pakistani troops were deployed on the border
 bharat ne bhi jammu-kashmir main sainik bhejne shuru kar die kyonki pakistan samarthit algaavvaad ke baad sthiti bighad gai thi
 Both sides were busy making war cry with their rhetoric

 "america believed that Pakistan would not back down from the use of nuclear weapons in the event of a war between the two countries

 udai bhaskar jaise vishleshak 1990 ke dakshin asia sankat ko ''parmaanu hathiyaar se las aatankwaad (newclear vepan anebld terarysm)'' yaa endablyuiti—kaa aarambh bindu maanate hai
 They say that with the help of terrorists waging a proxy war against India from behind the scenes, Pakistan began to bully the use of nuclear weapons to intimidate India from any conventional military action because it knew that India Pakistan is far ahead in conventional war capability
 lagata he, pakistan itane varshon tak—1993 main mumbai bam dhamaake, 2001 main sansad par jaish-e-mohammad or 26 november, 2008 ko mumbai par aatanki hamalaa jaisaa—har badi aatanki sajishon ke baad usee endablyuiti kaa dar dikhaakar bharat ko paaramparik sainya pratikriya se rokane main safal rahaa he
 On 26 February, the Mirage of the Indian Air Force entered the Pakistan border and carried out 'non-military air strikes' on the target
 bhartiya raksha vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki 1971 ke yuddh ke baad aisa pehali baar hua tha ki vaayu sena ke vimaanon ne pakistan main lakshya par bambaari kii thi
 Former Director General of Artillery Lieutenant General P
 ravishankar kehete hai, ''yah oparation pakistan kii puraani dharna ko todate hue bharat kii taraf se ek tarah kaa elaan tha ki ab vah gaiyr-paaramparik khatre se nipatane ke liye paaramparik yuddh se peeche nahin hatega, chaahe uskaa nuksaan kuch bhi kyon na ho
 However, after this action, the Pakistani Air Force also retaliated immediately and its planes crossed the Line of Control and dropped bombs at Bhimber, KG Top and Nariyan in Jammu and Kashmir and killed an Indian mig-21 Bison
 bharat ne bhi daawa kiya ki usne pakistan ke epa-16 ko maar giraaya or hisaab baraabar kar liya lekin mig-21 ke ek payalat, wing commander abhinandan vardhaman ke pakistan kii giraft main aa jane se sthiti jatil ho gai
 Photographs were released on Pakistani social media carrying the blood-soaked pilot's face and blindfold somewhere

 Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, while expressing his support for the efforts of Mujahira and his efforts for peace, was chanting 'sit and talk with India', he also took this incident as an opportunity for a PR Were living
 jis din # saynotowar twitor par trend kar rahaa tha, tab donon taraf kii sena puure alert par thim
 The heads of the three wings of the Indian Army informed Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the preparations for the war, the fighter ships were on constant patrol
 aise vakt main imran khan ke bayaan kaa mila-jula sanket gaya or karachi main ehtiyathan blassout kar diya gaya
 However, there was no indication that New Delhi was withdrawing from the fighting
 raksha adhikariyon kaa maananaa he ki sainya vikalp puri tarah khulaa he or yuddh ke badaae kii bhi ashanka he par iskaa nirnay rajnatik str par hoga
 What will the government do in the next few days after the attacks of Pakistan, everyone will be watching
 lekin kya bharat sangharsh ke sopanon par aage badaae ke vikalp kii ore janaa pasand karegaa yaa phir tanaavon ko khatm karne ke imran khan ke prastaav par vichaar karegaa? aaj sabase ahm sawaal yahi he or is rajnatik netritv ko is par vichaar karnaa he
 Defense experts are also talking about any such understanding
 dadhakati niyantran rekha(bharat-pakistan sangharsh sopan yaa ascolation leader kaa chauthaa charan)sambhaavnah ucchpakistan ke saath adhikansh sangharshon main, niyantran rekha hi ranbhumi sabit hoti he jahaan donon taraf se chote hathiyaaron or topakhane se golabari hoti rahati he
 For example, last year, the Line of Control was the fastest in 15 years
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki pakistan ne sangharsh viraam kaa 2,936 baar ulanghan kiya he
 Says Lt
 Gen
 Shankar, "shelling on the Line of Control is just an act of respect and when the shortage of ammunition starts it will decrease and our retaliation will become stronger
" hamen kuch paane or kuch ganvaane ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 It will be long
 ek str par jang bad jaaegi or pakistan tut jayega
 The former head of the defense wing in the Joint Intelligence Committee was Brigadier (re
 ) kuldeep singh ko lagata he ki sangharsh ko niyantran rekha tak simit rakhane se baat nahin banegi
 "we cannot achieve the target by acting on the loc as Pakistan will draw resources from the International Border (IB) region to the loc region," he says
 ''unki raay he, ''pakistan ko apane sansadhano kii kami main uljhane ke liye bharat ko uski sabhi taraf se antarrashtriya seemaa kshetron main gheraabandi ke liye jutana chahie or usamen joardaar dar paidaa karnaa chahie
 Nothing can be achieved from mere mobilization, as was done during Operation Parakram (after the Parliament attack)
 ''paramparaagat yuddh(charan 11)sambhaavnah bahut kambhartiya sena kaa cold start siddhant (pakistan ke saath yuddh kii sthiti main bharat kii ranneeti kaa purana siddhant), jise jaish hamale ke baad aajamaaya bhi gaya tha, paaramparik balon ko kuch hi ghanton ke bheetar hamale shuru karne ke liye teji se jutane kaa aahvaan karata he
 After the terrorist attack on Parliament in December 2001, the army made the largest military deployment since the 1971 war on the international border
 sena ne hamale kaa bhay to paidaa kiya tha lekin hamalaa nahin kiya or 11 maheene baad is tainaati ko khatm kiya gaya
 a senior defense officer considers Cold Start as the only military option against Pakistan, considering it an effective strategy to fight wars in the new era
 haalanki sena ko eendhan or gola-barood kii kamiyon ko dur karne main kai maheene lag sakate hai
 Moreover, it is not that Pakistan is not even in a position to challenge India in traditional military dominance
 isliye ek chote yuddh main nirnaayak parinaam kii aashaa nahin kii jaani chahie
 Brigadier Kuldeep Singh says, "if India makes a big military attack, Pakistan will be forced to respond and it can be difficult to control the situation after that
 '' yah kis str tak pahunch jaae, iskaa sahi-sahi andaja na to sarkaar or na hi sena laga sakati he
 Secret option (phase 4) possibility: Commander-in-chief General Bipin Rawat was asked at a seminar in Delhi in November whether India should move ahead on an aggressive proxy war strategy
 general ravat kii pratikriya dilachasp thi, ''sidhe upar uchhaala gaya pathar aapke sir par aakar giregaa
 
 
 What happens to these people (non-state actors) after the objective is fulfilled? ”this was a hypothetical question because India has no such latent capacity or at least it has done nothing in this direction in the last several decades
 is
 1998 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indra kumaar gujral ne pakistan ke andar bharat kii bahari khufia sanstha research and analysis wing (ro) ke siity-eks or siity-je naamak do gupt oparation ko band karne kaa aadesh de diya tha
 According to a senior diplomat, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was asked for the green signal to resume these clandestine operations but he also refused
 us adhikari kaa kahana he ki ye gupt khilaadi pakistan ke andar jaish or lashkar-e-taiyaba ko nishaanaa banane ke liye adarsh agent sabit hote
 Officials say that at least this could have given Pakistan the answer to what it had done
 pakistan ne 1947-48 se 1965 or 1999 tak bharat ke khilaaf sabhi yudhon main chhadam yuddh kaa istemaal kiya tha
 It used fidayeen attackers linked to the Haqqani network to target Indian interests in Afghanistan between 2008 and 2010
 ek fidaayin hamalavar ne kabul main bhartiya duutavas par hamalaa kiya jisamen bharat ke ek military ataichi samet 58 log maare gaye the
 One of the highlights of the proxy war is that irregular soldiers are sent as non-state actors, guerrillas, terrorists to fight the traditional army
 bharat ne pakistan ke khilaaf is vikalp kaa istemaal sirf ek baar 1971 ke yuddh ke dauraan kiya tha jab usne 1,00,000 purvi pakistani nagarikon kii 'mukti bahini' ko prashikshit kiya tha, jisane pakistan kii sena ko gher liya tha
 Analysts say the use of secret options is complex because it takes years to build and maintain such capabilities
 isliye philhal yah vikalp to hamaare paas uplabdh nahin he
 Air Raid (battle Phase 5) Possibility of Further Use: The death of 40 CRPF jawans in a fidayeen attack in Kamulwama on February 14 put tremendous pressure on the Narendra Modi government to take action
 sarkaar chunaav mod main he isliye yah dabaav zyada tha
 Alternatives to a ground attack using special forces or regular forces were not possible as most of the LOC is still covered with ice sheets
 bhartiya khufia agenciyon ne chuninda lakshyon par vaayu sena ke hawaii hamalon ke vikalp ko sahi mana
 However, if such airstrikes continue further, they can increase the conflict dramatically as both sides are capable of attacking each other
 philhal, pakistan dwaara kiye gaye javaabi hawaii hamalon ke saath, sarkaar par pratikriya dene or yuddh main apana dabadabaa sabit karne ke liye bahut adhik dabaav bana he
 The air strike option may not prove to be very effective because India does not currently have the same dominance over the Pakistani air force, for example, as Israel puts it on all its neighbors
 yani ham isse aashwast nahin ho sakate ki ham pakistan ko bahut had tak jhukaa lenge
 "we can carry out an airstrike on Pakistan," says a senior defense official
 ham 20 vimaanon ke ek batch main bhej sakate hai, lekin ashanka yah he ki pakistan hamaare mukaable kam sankhya main jahaajon ke baavjood javaabi karrwai kar saktaa he or aapako maat de saktaa he
 "therefore, every action should be taken in a conscious decision, decisions should not be taken only by looking at the emotional boil in the country
" tanaav ghataana(sangharsh sopan main pehle charan kii sthiti main lautnaa)sambhaavnah ucchvishleshkon kaa kahana he ki sabase zyada sambhaavna isi kii dikhti he
 Imran Khan has also indicated this after the Pakistani jet crossed the Line of Control
 15 kor ke purv commander leftinent general (ri
 ) Syed Ata Hasnain says, "the decision to retaliate on the Pakistani provocation is India's decision, but it is unlikely that India will want to increase it much
" pakistan vaishvik str par alag-thalag padataa ja rahaa he or antarrashtriya birdari majbootee se bharat ke saath khadi najar aati he
 Therefore it can be beneficial for us to reduce the chances of war
 haalanki, bhartiya payalat kii rihaai ab ek badi praathamikta he
 That is, the story will once again come under the diplomatic purview
 ''air marshall (ri

 K
 nair kehete hai, ''pakistan ne sainya thikaanon ke paas bina kisi nuksaan vaali javaabi karrwai karne kii koshish kii he
 Of course in the form of air raids, he has stepped up the struggle step but he has done so only to save his face
 donon deshon ko yah samajhane kii aavashyaktaa he ki yuddh kii ore aage badaae kaa koi bhi prayaas bahut adhik khatarnaak ho saktaa he or har haal main ise taalane kii koshishen honi chahie

 Hopefully after this, you will not need to google to find out the meaning of a word while listening to the song
 saath hi agali baar jab koi dost kisi shabd par atakegaa, to uske saamne aap apane 'gyaan' kii shekhi bhi baghaar paaenge
 This time, despite being similar, we also talk about three words with slightly different meanings
 ye hai guzarish, iltaja or fariyaad
 Word 1: request: request, request, reference: to request someone, it is called requesting
 shabdic arth main hi istemaal hota he
 There is no rhythm in the request or request, as needed to fit into a song
 isliye geetkaar bhai 'guzarish' kaa istemaal zyaada kar lete hai
 Song: You are my unfulfilled thirst, you have come to mind, i am like you
 jab aapke nivedan main 'nivedan bhav' kuch zyada ho to 'iltaja' uske liye sahi shabd hoga
 Song: Lonely heart forget what has happened with this tear, it is easy to tell, what is difficult to achieve : Solicitation: On the level of meaning, he is the father of 'request' and 'request'
 matlab yah ki yahaan nivedan karne vaala yaachak kii bhoomika main he or jisase nivedan kiya ja rahaa he vah tamaam aadhaaron par yaachak se 'shreshth' sthiti main he
 For example, a thief who is killed, pleads to save his life from the crowd
 yaa jahaanpanaah ke darbar main koi sevak apni koi fariyaad lekar aata he
 Song: a complaint is buried in your heart like someone has said to your eyes as if you are awake in your age, as if you are still alive, but you have stopped breathing, like words 4: Bazmarth: Mahafil References: Where four-six people are sitting and they will continue, In the round you can say bazm
 iskaa istemaal kai sandarbhon main kiya gaya he, kiya jaataa he
 For example, 'bazm-e-shayari' means gathering for shayari
 lekin 'bazm-e-duniya' ek saahitiyik prayog he, jiskaa abhidha main arth 'duniya' se hi he
 Song: Whenever life brings you in your mind, it looks better than the earth moon, we have the word 5: Harparth: Alphabet letter reference: A, B, C- These are the alphabets of the Hindi alphabet
 geetkaaron ne 'harf' ko kai sandarbhon main istemaal kiya he
 For example- 'there was no injury from his sad lips
 ' iskaa yah maani nahin he ki bhai varnmaala kii maukhik pariksha main fail ho gaya he
 This means that he stood silent - without saying anything

 To stop the growing factionalism in the Congress, the party vice-president Rahul Gandhi has decided to resort to dinner diplomacy
 congress main dhadon main bante netaaon or bajurg, yuvaaon main chal rahe netritv vivaad ko thaamne ke liye akhil bhartiya congress dinar teble tok kaa sahaara legi
 It is being started from Rajasthan and Gujarat
 dilli ke congress headquarter se ye rajyon ko aadesh die gaye hai ki party ke sabhi prabhavi netaaon ko jajam par baitaane ke liye rajya kaa varisht netaaon ko ek saath khaane par baithaaya jaae jahaan par ye netaa aapasi matbhed, gile-shikave bhuulakar baatcheet karen or galatchhemiyon ko dur karen
 All this is being done to bring it into preparation mode before the election
 isamen pradesh ke varisht netaa apane ghar par duusare varisht netaaon ko dinar par bulaayenge jahaan aapas main baithkar rajya kii raajnneeti or party kii sthiti par charchaa hogi
 The party's state president, former union minister, party legislature party leader and deputy leader and in-charge secretary of the party will be called for dinner
 bataaya jaataa he ki is bare main rajasthan ke purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot or rajasthan congress ke adhyaksh sachin payalat ko rajasthan congress ke prabharee gurudas kaamat ke jarie ye soochna bhijwa di gai thi
 But when no one took the initiative to call each other for dinner, Kamat called himself and asked Ashok Gehlot when he should come to his house for dinner
 phir ashok gahalot ne samay 3 oktober ko tay kar unako suchit kiya he
 Similarly, Sachin Pilot was also called and asked that when senior leaders are sent to his house for dinner, the pilot has fixed the time for October 15
 gurudas kaamat ke anusaar gujarat ke party netaaon ko bhi kaha gaya he ki aapas main manmutav khatm kar ek duusare ke ghar dinar karnaa shuru karen
 Significantly, like Gujarat, the Rajasthan Congress is also divided into the Gehlot camp, Sachin camp and CP Joshi camp
 party ke zyaadaatar varisht netaa ashok gahalot ke saath hai to noujvaan sachin payalat ke saath hai jabaki rahul ganghi kii nazdikiyon kii vajah se party mahasachiv seepi joshi ke saath bhi rajya ke netaaon kaa ek dhada he
 The question arises that when there is a need to decide the time of dinner from Delhi, there is doubt that the Congress will get anything from such a din diplomacy
 haalanki congress kii koshish he ki kam se kam congress janata ke bich bante hue dharon ke bajaae ekajute ghar kii tarah dikhe

 According to a senior official, the social media platform will be directed by the government to use Section 69 of the IT Act to block hate messages, photos and videos before spreading or going viral
 kabutar ko aamtaur par shanti ke pratik maane jate hai lekin pakistan seemaa par lagaataar aise kabutar mil rahe hai, jinka istemaal yaa to jasusi ke liye yaa phir smagalleron kaa sandesh idhar-udhar karne ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 Police and security agencies have examined these pigeons many times
 kai baar code main likhe sandesh bhi mil chuke hai
 In this episode, on Saturday, police of Sadar police station of district Gurdaspur have found a papakistani pigeon
 yah kabutar hind paak seemaa ke najadik padate gaanv chakk araiyaan ke jasvindar singh ko apane ghar main mila
 Police pigeons have already found police in different villages near the border in Gurdaspur
 ye kabutar koun or kis makasad se seemaa paar bharat ke punjab ke hisse main bhej rahaa he, yah police ke liye ab aisi paheli banati ja rahi he jo sulajhane kaa naam nahin le rahi
 Jaswinder Singh saw a pigeon sitting on the roof of his house which could not fly due to fatigue
 jasvindar singh ne vah kabutar pakad liya or jab usko dana-pani khilaane laga to usne dekha ki kabutar ke pankhon par urdu main likhi ek mohar lagi he
 a number 03024929685 is written with the stamp
 tab uskaa maathaa thanka or usne police ko isaki soochna di
 The police took the pigeon with them

 Reported to police when he saw the stamp and number on the wings of the pigeon
 police ne maukey par ja kar kabutar ko apane kabje main le liya he
 Police officer says that this pigeon is being investigated on our behalf and from different investigating agencies as to who are sending such pigeons from across the border to our area and for what purpose
 bataa den ki pakistani kabutaron kaa gurdaspur ke seemaa ilaake main milane kaa yah pehla maamla nahin he
 Earlier also, such pigeons have been found in Banyal, Dinanagar, near the indo-pak border in Gurdaspur

 The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) says that more stringent rules will have to be implemented to punish those making false and unnecessary complaints of corruption against government officials
 sutron ne bataaya he ki piemo is baat se chintit he ki is tarah kii farzi shikayaton ke chalate adhikariyon ko nirnay lene main der lag sakati he, yaa ve nirnay lene se hi kataraane lag sakate hai
 The PMO has reportedly sought such guidelines, which decide how to appoint lawyers to advocate for bureaucrats and others
 sarkari adhikariyon ke khilaaf kii jane vaali shikaayatein carmik evam prashikshan vibhaag (department of Personnel and Training - dopt) or kendriya satarkta ayog (sivisi) tak pahunchati hai
 Sources have told NDTV that the investigation of these complaints sent without evidence not only costs a lot of 'man-power and time', but also causes the authorities to face harassment and mental distress
 tippaniyan To protect the government officials from false complaints of corruption, the PMO has asked dopt to formulate rules in this matter as per international standards
 yah suzav bhi diya gaya he ki jin adhikariyon ko bina vajah nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa ho, unke maamle main sarkaar unki taraf se mukadmaa lard sakati he
 Significantly, after winning the election last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had committed to ending the infamous red tape in India, and urged the bureaucrats to think creatively and work diligently, so that The bureaucracy was strengthened, and the administration of the Congress-led government was stuck in many cases of corruption in the last few decades
 Nick was able to overcome the situation of lameness
 unhone uttardaayitv samajhane ko bhi mahatvapurn bataaya tha, or ek electronic sarveylens system launch kiya tha, jiske jariye yah jaancha ja sake ki adhikari vakt par offis aa rahe hai yaa nahin
 Sources have said that the PMO is concerned that due to such fake complaints, the authorities may take time to decide, or they may get clipped by the decision
 piemo ne kathith rup se is tarah ke dishanirdesh mangaaye hai, jinamein tay kiya gaya ho ki naukarshahon or anya logon kii pairvi karne ke liye vakeelon ko kis tarah tainaat kiya jaae
 Complaints against government officials reach the Department of Personnel and Training - dopt and the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)
 sutron ne NDTV ko bataaya he ki sabooton ke bina bheji gai in shikayaton kii jaanch main na sirf bahut zyaada 'main-power or samay' kharch hota he, balki inke kaaran adhikariyon ko bhi pratadna tathaa maansik ksht se guzaranaa padataa he
 The comments piemo ne sarkari adhikariyon ko bhrashtachar kii juthi shikayaton se bachaane ke liye dopt se kaha he ki vah is maamle main antarrashtriya maanakon ke anuroop niyam taiyaar kare
 It has also been suggested that in the case of officers who are being targeted without reason, the government can fight the case on their behalf
 gauratlab he ki pichley saal chunaav main jeet hasil karne ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bharat main badnaam lalaphitaashahee ko khatm kar dene ke prati katibaddhta jataai thi, or naukarshahon ko srujanaatmak tareeke se sochane or lagan-mehnat se kaam karne kaa aagrah kiya tha, taaki naukarshahi majboot ho sake, tathaa pichley kuch dashakon main congress-nit sarkaar ke bhrashtachar ke bahut-se maamalon main fanse-uljhe rahane ke kaaran paidaa hui prashasnic panguta kii sthiti se ubra ja sake
 He also said it was important to understand the responsibility, and launched an electronic surveillance system to check whether the officers were coming to office on time

 hooda ne das vidhayakon samet purv vidhayakon, purv mantriyon, purv sansadeey sachivon samet anya netaaon ko is samiti main shaamil kiya tha
 Hooda will say goodbye to the Congress or will he remain in the party
 is par unke dwaara banaai gai 36 sadasyeey cameti dilli main aaj apana nirnay sunayegi

 hooda ne is sambandh main haal hi main sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kar apni sharten rakhi thi, lekin congress haikaman kii taraf se bhi abhi tak koi thos jawaab unhen nahin mil sakaa he

 Kallis is the closest player to Sachin's 51 Test centuries, scoring 44 centuries

 i do not see it as a goodbye, i still have a great appetite to advance South Africa and win the 2015 World Cup

 bhartiya cricket team ke mukhya chayankarta kris shrikant kii buhat jald sillection cameti se chuttee ho sakati he
 The tenure of the current selection committee of the BCCI is coming to an end this month and whether or not there is any change in the new committee will be considered in the annual meeting next month
 vaise bisisiai ke kai sadsy kris shrikant vaali cameti ko hi aage badhanaa chaahate hai kyonki is team ne pichley 3 saalon main laajawab khel dikhaaya he or bharat ko 28 saal baad world cap jitaane main bhi bada yogadan diya he
 At the same time some members say that after the embarrassing Test series against England, the time has come to give a chance to the new selection committee
 vyaapman ghotaale ke silsile main mangalvaar ko dheron press conference huin
 But the Bhopal press conference will be remembered because the person whose name appeared in an income tax raid sat next to Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar
 agar badi pikchar dekhen to 2013 main hui red or vyaapman ke rishte judate dikh rahe hai
 How can it be a mere coincidence that the diary and documents found during the Income Tax Raid contain the details of conversations with all those people who are either inside the prison in Vyapam or are out of breath with their turn
 is puri kahani ke mukhya kirdaar kii bhoomika main sudhir sharma he jo mahaj 10 saal pehle ek teacher tha or dekhte hi dekhte khud ko bhopal main sabase zyada iskar chukaane vaala bataane laga
 Its fate was openly in contact with Laxmikant Sharma
 lakshmikant sharma bijepi ke netaa hai, philhal sudhir ke saath hi jail main band hai
 The relationship of these two in Vyapam scam is also interesting
 ek duusare se itane madhur sambandh the ki lakshmikant kii licency revolver iskar red ke dauraan sudhir ke ghar se nikali
 Laxmikant Sharma became the first Minister of Mining in the state and later the Minister of Higher Education
 unke rishte sangh netaa suresh soni se kaaphi achche the
 This is the network of relationships in which the secrets of all business and other scams are hidden
 kaha jaataa he ki lakshmikant jahaan-jahaan pahunche vahaan-vahaan sudhir ne kismat aajamaai or vaare nyaare kar daale
 First Laxmikant became Mining Minister, Sudhir Sharma became Mining King
 or phir jab lakshmikant ucch shiksha mantri bane to vahaan bhi vyaapman kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 The comments iskar ke chaape main ai baton se pataa lag rahaa he ki sudhir sharma un tamaam logon kaa khyaal rakh rahaa tha jo uske yaa to sahaayak the yaa phir raajnneeti main naye pad pratishtha dene vaale the
 For example, the then BJP President, who awarded Sudhir posts in the party
 sudhir kii kamai kaa ek chota sa hissaa logon ke management par kharch ho rahaa tha, ye bhi ab iskar ke kaagazon se saaf he
 From Suresh Soni of the Sangh to BJP MP Anil Dave
 to kya is lut main sirf sudhir sharma, lakshmikant or ikkaa dukka adhikari log shaamil the? yaa phir ham kahani kaa sirf ek hissaa dekh rahe hai? vyaapman kaa ghotaalaa to saamne aa gaya lekin kya hamen is kahani ko ab reverse karke nahin dekhnaa chaiye? kya ye nahin dekhnaa chaiye ki agar shiksha vibhaag main rahete huye itani bada racket taiyaar hua to khanan mantralay main kaise kaise khel nahin huye honge? kya vahaan afasar se lekar sudhir tak lut tantra kaa hissaa nahin the? kya sirf sudhir ne khanan main haath maaraa yaa duusare ek or suurama dilip suryavanshi bhi usee dauraan teji se bade? If you look at the big picture, the relationship between Red and Vyapam in 2013 seems to be linked
 ye mahaj sanyog kaise ho saktaa he ki iskar ke chaape ke dauraan jo diary or dastauez mili usamen un sab logon ke saath baatcheet kaa byora he jo yaa to vyaapman main jail ke andar hai yaa phir baahar apni baari ko lekar saansat main hai
 The main character of this entire story is Sudhir Sharma, who was a teacher just 10 years ago, and on seeing this, he described himself as the highest tax payer in Bhopal
 isaki kismat khuli lakshmikant sharma ke saath sampark main aane par
 Laxmikant Sharma is a BJP leader, currently lodged in jail along with Sudhir
 vyaapman ghotaale main in donon kaa rishta bhi dilachasp he
 Laxmikant's licensed revolver came out of Sudhir's house during the Income Tax Raid
 lakshmikant sharma, rajya main pehle khanan mantri or baad main ucch shiksha mantri bane
 Their relationship was very good with the union leader Suresh Soni
 ye rishton kaa jaal hi he jisamen saare vyaapman or duusare ghotaalon ke raaj chhipe hai
 It is said that wherever Laxmikant reached, Sudhir tried his luck and made fun of him
 pehle lakshmikant khanan mantri bane to sudhir sharma mining king ban gayi
 And then when Laxmikant became the Minister of Higher Education, the business started there too
 tippaniyan It has been found from the things that came in the Income Tax raid that Sudhir Sharma was taking care of all those people who were either his assistants or new positions in politics
 masalan bijepi ke tab ke adhyaksh jinhone sudhir ko party main padon se nawaaza
 a small part of Sudhir's income was being spent on the management of the people, this is also clear from the income tax papers
 jisamen sangh ke suresh soni se lekar bijepi saansad anil dave tak shaamil hai
 So were only Sudhir Sharma, Laxmikant and a few officers involved in this loot? Or are we just watching a part of the story? The Vyapam scam has come to the fore, but should we not reverse this story now? Shouldn't it be seen that if such a huge racket was prepared while living in the Education Department, how would there not have been games in the Ministry of Mining? Were there no part of the loot system from officer to Sudhir? Did only Sudhir hit the hand in mining or did another Surma Dilip Suryavanshi also grow rapidly during that time? is puri kahani ke mukhya kirdaar kii bhoomika main sudhir sharma he jo mahaj 10 saal pehle ek teacher tha or dekhte hi dekhte khud ko bhopal main sabase zyada iskar chukaane vaala bataane laga

 kendriya cabinet ne mangalvaar ko teen mahatvapurn bhrashtachar nirodhi vidheyakon ko manjuuri pradaan kii
 Among these are bills related to judicial accountability, protection of corruption busters and civil rights, which Anna Hazare has been demanding to bring under the purview of Lokpal
 cabinet ne nyaayik maanak or javabdehi vidheyak, 2010, janhit ujagar karne vaale logon kaa sangrakshan vidheyak, 2010 (vislabloar vidheyak) tathaa citigen charter evam shikaayat nivaaran vidheyak, 2011 par muhar lagaai
 However, the discussion on the Food Security Bill remained incomplete and could possibly be taken up in the next Cabinet meeting on December 18
 yah samprag adhyaksh or rashtriya salaahkaar parishad kii pramukh sonia gandhi kaa mahatvakankshi vidheyak he
 Team Anna is demanding that the judiciary, citizen charter and grievance redressal system be brought under the purview of Lokpal
 haalanki sarkaar or kuch vipakshi dalon kaa maananaa he ki in muddon se nipatane ke liye alag kanoon hone chahie
 The Judicial Accountability Act is to determine accountability in the judiciary
 isamen ucchtam nyaayalay yaa kisi ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish ke kadachaar kii shikayaton main jaanch kii pranali ke praavdhaan honge
 The bill also proposes the formation of a committee to investigate the grievances against judges and to add provisions for closed-door proceedings
 haalanki sutron ke anusaar cabinet main kuch mantriyon ne ek praavdhaan ko waapas lene par jor diya jisamen nyaayadhishon ke liye usee adaalat main vakaalat karne vaale vakeelon se baatcheet or kareebi rishte rakhane par pabandi kii baat he
 The Parliament's Standing Committee on Personnel and Law and Justice also recommended the inclusion of a provision to prohibit judges from making inappropriate comments against other constitutional entities or people during the hearing in courts
 haalanki sarkaar ne shuru main ise manjuur kiya tha or cabinet note main bhi iskaa zikr tha lekin yah spasht nahin he ki aaj baithak main paarit vidheyak main iskaa zikr he yaa nahin
 According to sources, there were differences regarding the time limit for services to government officials in the cabinet in the context of Citizen Charter and Grievance Redressal System Bill
 kuch mantriyon kaa kahana tha ki 15 din kii avadhi bahut kam he
 Later it was reduced to 30 days
 cabinet ne vislabloar vidheyak par bhi muhar lagaai jisamen mantriparishad, nyaaypalika, niamak praadhikaranon or nigamon ke sadasyon ko iske daayre main laane kii baat he
 Government sources said that the Food Security Bill was deferred because time was not left due to a meeting of UPA allies on the Lokpal subject which was immediately after the Cabinet meeting
 khaadya mantri ke ve thomas ne baad main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, khaadya suraksha vidheyak par baatcheet adhuri rahi
 We are making every effort to bring the Bill in this session of Parliament
 varsh 2018 se desh main vitt varsh kii shuruyaat april ke bajaay janvari se ho sakati he
 The government is preparing for this
 iske saath hi desh main 150 saal se chali aa rahi april-march kii vitt varsh kii parampara main badlaav ho saktaa he
 If this happens, the next budget of the Center may be presented in November this year
 sutron ke mutabik, sarkaar vitt varsh ko calendar varsh ke anuroop badalane par kaam kar rahi he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has advocated this change
 yah ek or aitihaasik badlaav hoga
 The government has earlier changed the decades-old tradition of presenting the budget on the last date of February
 is saal bajet ek farvari ko pesh kiya gaya
 Accordingly, according to the proposal which is being discussed to change the financial year, the budget session of Parliament can be done well before December so that the budget process can be completed before the end of the year
 sutron ne kaha ki bajet prakriya ko puraa karne main do maah kaa samay lagata he
 In such a situation, the likely date of the budget session may be the first week of November
 bharat main vitt varsh ek april se 31 march tak hota he
 This system was adopted in 1867 so that the Indian fiscal year can be aligned with the British government's fiscal year
 usase pehle tak bharat main vitt varsh kii shuraat ek may ko shuru hokar 30 april tak hoti thi
 The government set up a high-level committee last year after Prime Minister Modi expressed his desire to match the calendar year of the financial year
 samiti ko vitt varsh ko ek janvari se shuru karne kii vyavhaarita kaa adhyayan karne ko kaha gaya
 The committee submitted its report to the Finance Minister in December
 udhar, niti ayog ke ek note main bhi kaha gaya he ki vitt varsh main badlaav jaruri he kyonki, maujuuda pranali main kaamkaaj ke satr kaa upyog nahin ho paata
 a few months ago the Parliament's Standing Committee on Finance also recommended shifting the fiscal year to january-december
 tippaniyan Modi had advocated a change in the financial year, saying that there was a need to develop a speedy system, which could work between diversity
 unhone kaha tha, samay ke kharaab prabandhan kii vajah se kai acchhee pahal or yojanaayen vaanchit nattejey dene main vifal rahati hai
 Madhya Pradesh is the first state to announce the financial year as january-december
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) According to sources, the government is working on changing the fiscal year to the calendar year
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne is badlaav kii vakaalat kii he
 This will be another historical change
 sarkaar isse pehle bajet ko farvari maheene kii antim taarikh ko pesh karne kii dashakon puraani parampara ko badal chuki he
 This year, the budget was presented on 1 February
 aise main vitt varsh ko badalane ke jis prastaav par vichaar-vimarsh kiya ja rahaa he uske mutabik sansad kaa bajet satr disambar se kaaphi pehle ho saktaa he taaki bajet prakriya ko saal ke ant se pehle puraa kiya ja sake
 Sources said that it takes two months to complete the budget process
 aise main bajet satr kii sambhavit taarikh november kaa pehla saptaah ho sakati he
 The financial year in India is from 1 April to 31 March
 is vyavastha ko 1867 main apanaaya gaya tha jisase bhartiya vitt varsh kaa british sarkaar ke vitt varsh se talmail kiya ja sake
 Earlier, the beginning of the financial year in India used to start on May 1 and till April 30
 pradhanmantri modi ke vitt varsh kaa calendar varsh se mail karne kii ichha jataane ke baad sarkaar ne pichley saal ek ucchstareey samiti kaa gathan kiya
 The committee was asked to study the feasibility of starting the financial year from January 1
 samiti ne disambar main apni report vitt mantri ko saunp di
 On the other hand, a note of NITI Aayog also states that changes in the financial year are necessary because, in the current system, the working session is not used
 kuch maheene pehle sansad kii vitt par sthaayee samiti ne bhi vitt varsh ko sthanantarit kar janvari-disambar karne kii sifarish kii thi
 The comments modi ne vitt varsh main badlaav kii vakaalat karte hue kaha tha ki ek tejartaar vyavastha viksit kiye jane kii jarurat he, jo vividhta ke bich kaam kar sake
 He had said, due to poor management of time, many good initiatives and schemes fail to produce desired results
 vitt varsh ko janvari-disambar karne kii ghoshnaa karne vaala madhya pradesh pehla rajya he

 Where incidents do not happen, but Bihar is being targeted
 tejasvi ne is maukey par apane kaam ko lekar bhi baat kii, saath hi mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke saath apane sambandhon ko bhi behatar bataaya
 What have you done in the ministry you have received? What are your priorities? Tejashwi Yadav- The ministry that i have got is related to infrastructure
 bihar main jo construction ho vah sabase behatar ho world class ho
 Giving the best roads in Bihar, making flyovers is part of our Twenty20 plan
 taaki logon ko acchhee sadaken mil saken
 How easy or how difficult it is to work with Nitish Kumar? Tejashwi Yadav - See why it will be difficult
 gargian jaisaa mukhyamantri mila he, unke leadership main kaam seekhney ko miltaa he
 Suggestions are also given from time to time, conversations are also going on, our co-ordination for working is going very well
 nitish se khul kar baat kar pate hai? koi hejitation to nahin he?tejasvi yadav- hejitation nahin he, jaise ki unako main bachapan se dekhtaa rahaa hum
 She has worked with my father in the JP movement
 sabhi muddon par ham khul ke baat karte hai
 You also get to learn a lot

 There are people of BJP and no one else
 chunaav ke samay main pradhanmantri ji bhi aae the bihar
 He was saying Jungle Raj, but what mandate did the public give
 janata to har baat ko jaanati he, inke kehane se na kehane se koi fark nahin padataa
 Where does the incident happen in the country? dilli main hoti hai
 The entire cabinet sits there, the Prime Minister sits, yet events happen
 haalanki main justiphi nahin kar rahaa hum, bihar kii ghatnaon ko
 Such incidents should not happen
 hamaari sarkaar prayaas kar rahi he ki aisi ghatnaayen naa hon
 But there we take immediate action, there is no action anywhere else
 kuch log hai jinako bihar kii janata ne mandet nahin diya vah log bihar ko badnaam karne kii koshish karte hai
 What did the central government do for Bihar
 jo special package dene kii baat hui thi uskaa kya hua
 There are seven ministers at the center from Bihar, what did they do for Bihar
 jahaan tak sharabbandi kii baat he nitish upi gaye
 There was opposition, Samajwadi Party said that should take care of its state? He is not getting as much support as he wanted? Tejashwi - Leave UP, don't you

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke jivan kii kahani parade par dikhaai degi
 His biopic is being produced
 modi kii bhoomika khyath kalakaar or saansad paresh rawal nibhaayenge
 According to the information, the script of the film has been finalized and the casting work has been completed
 lead role ke liye paresh rawal kaa naam tay he
 Recently Paresh said, "no one else can snatch this role from me
 mujhe bharosa he ki aap sabko meraa kaam pasand aayega
 "paresh Rawal's tweet - Modi is brother-in-law, is blocking the path like Salis
 Let us tell you that Shatrughan Sinha's name was first revealed for Modi's role, but later Paresh Rawal was decided
 paresh ne kaha, 'modi kaa role karnaa bahut badi jimmedaari he
 i live for Modi
 'jaankaree ke anusaar, film kii shooting sitambar main shuru hogi
 Paresh is also the producer of this film
 british saansad alok sharma ne apni bharat yatra ke dauraan bhale hi kohinoor lautaane kii bharat sarkaar kii muhim ko khaarij kar diya ho lekin bharat sarkaar is bare main apni koshish jari rakhegi
 This will continue to be discussed at the diplomatic level as well as at the level of the governments of the two countries
 sarkaar ke sutron ke mutabik ye kahana galat he ki sanyukt raashtra ghoshnaptr ke aadhaar parkohinoor wapasmaangane kaa bharat ke paas koi kanoonee aadhaar nahin he
 While India also has legal grounds and arguments, it may not need to be used at the moment
 shikhar vaarta kaa bhi vikalpsanskruti mantralay ke sutron ke mutabik pradhanmantri karyaalay ke saath hi is mudde se jude kai anya mantralayon jaise videsh or samskruti mantralay se aage charchaa honi he
 Right now, ways to take this matter forward effectively are being discussed
 inamen awwal tokootnithik strapar baat aage badhaai jaaegi
 Apart from this, the summit between the governments of the two countries is also an option
 jaanch hogi to sachai saamne aegijahan tak britain kii ye daleel he ki bharat ke paas kohinoor waapas maangane kaa koi kanoonee aadhaar nahin he
 On this, sources in the Government of India say that we have strong arguments to bring back Kohinoor and a strong legal base
 lekin uskaa istemaal anya vikalp ke taur par samay aane par kiya jayega
 The UN document that is being talked about has many legal ramifications
 samakaleen punjab ke 13 saal ke raja dalip singh se kin paristhitiyon main kaise dabaav daalkar samakaleen british hukumat nekohinoor hirasarander karaayaa iskaa khulaasa ab tak kisi ne nahin kiya he
 If it is also investigated, the truth will be revealed
 aise hi kai kanoonee or aitihaasik nukte hai jin par antarrashtriya adaalat main jirah hogi to bharat apana paksh majbootee se rakhega
 But India wants that it does not come
 anya deshon se bhi apni dharohar waapas laaegi bharat sarkaaris puure prakaran main bharat sarkaar ko ummid he ki britain kii nai pradhanmantri theresa me kii sarkaar ke saath kohinoor ke mudde par bhi sakaaratmak baatcheet hogi
 Sources in the Ministry of Culture have also indicated that the Government of India will clear its intention by giving a fresh affidavit during the next hearing of the PIL under consideration of Kohinoor's return to the Supreme Court
 sarkaar usamen ye bataaegi ki kohinoor ko britain se waapas laane kii koshishen kis kis str par jari hai
 It is a different matter that a few months ago, the Central Government had given an affidavit in the Supreme Court and stood up for the campaign to return to Kohinoor
 lekin ab puri shiddat se sarkaar ise hi nahin balki kai deshon se apni aitihaasik dharoharon ko waapas bharat laane kii muhim main juty he
 Success has also been achieved in many places
 lekin philhal to badi chunauti kohinoor kii vaapasi hi he

 Yuvraj said that players like Dhoni are not made in one day, it takes years for it, now it is almost a year to start the T20 World Cup, so time is still left

 Only 4% of the people are convicted

 At the event held at the Marriott Marquis Hotel, Rahul once again surrounded the Modi government on the issue of employment
 saath hi hinsak ghatnaon or ashishnutaa ko lekar duniya main bharat kii chhavi bigadane kii baat kahi
 The image of India deteriorated, the Congress vice-president said that the image of India has deteriorated abroad, "india has been known worldwide for thousands of years to live with unity and peace, but now this image is being spoiled
 desh main kuch aisi takate hai, jo bharat ko baant rahi hai'
 For 1000s of years, India has had a reputation of peace & harmony

 Rahul said, 'many Democratic and Republic leaders in America asked me what is going on in your country these days
 aapkaa desh to shanti ke liye janaa jaataa tha'
 Rahul said, 'people are asking what happened to India's tolerance? Biggest questions raised outside India: What happened to tolerance that used to prevail in India? What happened to the harmony? # rginus— Congress (@incindia) September 21, 2017 Employment is the real challenger; 
 yahi aaj bharat ke liye sabase bada chalange he'
 After this problem, Rahul also targeted the Modi government, stating the reason for this
 rahul ne kaha, ' rojgaar kii samasya isliye punap rahi he kyonki aajkal sirf 50-60 companiyon par hi focus kiya ja rahaa he
 If employment is to be increased, then small and medium companies will also have to be encouraged '
 NRI hi bharat kii ridhisse pehle rahul ne NRI samudaay kii jamkar tarif kii or unhen bharat kii ridh bataaya
 Rahul said that the real movement of the Congress was the NRI movement
 rahul ne kaha, 'gandhi, nehru, patel sabhi enarai the
 All these people lived abroad and returned to India and worked for the country
 kurrian bhi ek enarai the, jo bharat main dugdh kranti laae'
 Idea of congress Thousands of years, Puranarahul Gandhi also spoke about Congress ideas during this period
 rahul ne kaha ki congress kaa vichaar uske sanghathan kii sthapana se nahin he, balki ye vichaar hajaaron saal purana he
 He said that this idea is to stand with truth, which has been the heritage of India and Mahatma Gandhi also stood with that idea

 During this, Rahul attacked the Narendra Modi government fiercely
 rahul ne yahaan kaha ki modi sarkaar rojgaar paidaa karne main fail ho rahi he
 However, the Congress vice-president here also admitted that the Modi-led BJP government got support in India because people were angry with the Congress party over the issue of unemployment
 barkale main bhi barase the rahulprinston uniwarsity se pehle rahul gandhi ne isi hafte apane america daure par barkale kii uniwarsity of california main bhi ek kaarykram kiya tha
 In this program, Rahul had openly expressed views on the failed policies of the Modi government, from dynasticism in Indian politics

 Suddenly a person came to my house and he said, doctor, leave the office, your encounter is going to happen
 main maut se darane vaala nahin hum, isliye maine us baat par dhyaan nahin diya
 "I thought a bad situation would arise in the whole country
" isliye main turant ek paise kaa packet lekar karyaalay se nikal gaya or pulisavaalon ko bolaa ki main ja rahaa hum
 Outside i stopped the auto, took one or two workers from there and got out of the auto
 'auto se hi kiya rajasthan siem ko phonepravin togadiya ne bataaya ki jab wo karyaalay se nikal gaye to unhone rajasthan sarkaar se sampark saadhane kii koshish kii

 unhen kaarykram karne kii prashasan ne anumati nahin di thi
 Despite this, Togadia addressed the people

 vishwa vyapaar sanghathan (dablutio) main vyapaar sugamawa qaraar (tiefee) ke karyanvayan kaa rasta khul gaya he
 India and the United States have overcome the deadlock on the issue of food security while safeguarding the interests of Indian farmers
 america ne khadyann ke bhandaaran ke mudde par bharat ke prastaav kaa samarthan karne kii sahmati di he
 It will now be sent to the WTO General Council for approval, so that the trade facilitation agreement can be signed
 yah qaraar maheenon se atka hua he
 Announcing the success, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that India and the United States have succeeded in resolving differences in the WTO on issues of public food storage for the purpose of food security
 unhone kaha ki isse dablutio ko or adhik safaltaaon ke liye taiyaar kiya ja sakegaa
 Along with this, Sitharaman expressed confidence that the members would take the matter forward with constructive spirit in the WTO
 mantri ne aage kaha ki kai deshon ko dablutio main bharat ke drushtikon uchit laga he or america ne bhi isaki saraahna kii he
 Now the US has openly supported our concern over public food storage
 sitaraman ne kaha, bharat ne kabhi bhi vyapaar sugamawa main baadha nahin daali
 We only want to protect the interests of our farmers
 vaanijya mantri ne kaha ki dablutio kii aam parishad ko bharat kaa prastaav milegaa or america hamaara samarthan karegaa
 He said that after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to America, understanding about India's position became better
 sitaraman ne kai baar twit kar kaha, bharat bahupaksheeya vyapaarik pranali kaa majboot samarthak he or ham ise or majboot karne ko patibaddh hai
 The Bali Agreement was not perfect
 hamane yah mudda uthaaya tha
 We are happy to say that differences have been resolved
 sitaraman ne ek bayaan main kaha, bharat bahupaksheeya vyapaar pranali kaa bada samarthak he or vah ise majboot karne evam yah sunishchat karne ke liye patibaddh he ki dablutio vaishvik aarthik garh kaa mukhya stambh bana rahe
 He said, the WTO is in the interest of developing countries and especially the poorest and the least troubled among them and we are in favor of working to strengthen this institution
 unhone yah bhi kaha, kuch deshon ke bich kii vyapaar vyavastha bahupaksheeya pranali kii jagah nahin le sakati or yah dablutio ke paardarshita evam samaveshita sambandhi buniyadi siddhant ke khilaaf he
 Recently some members of the WTO suggested that if there are differences between some members then there may be trade agreements in some other countries
 bharat ne saaf kiya tha ki vah khaadya sabsidi maamle kaa sthaayee samaadhaan hone tak tiefee kaa samarthan nahin kar saktaa, jiske tahat vaishvik seemaa-shulk mandandon ko aasaan banaaya janaa he
 India asked the WTO to amend the criteria for estimation of agricultural subsidies so that the country could continue to buy food grains at minimum support price from farmers and sell it to the poor at a cheaper rate without violating the WTO norms
 dablutio ke maujuuda mandandon ke tahat khaadya sabsidi kaa dayera kul khadyann utpaadan ke mulya ke 10 pratishat tak hona chahie, haalanki sabsidi kii maatra kaa akalan do dashak pehle kii keemat ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 It is feared that India may violate the border when it implements its food security program
 mudda sulajhane ke bich sitaraman ne kaha, hamane bali package kaa samarthan kiya, lekin baad ke ghatnakram ne ummid ko jhuthlaayaa to bharat ke paas is prakriya ko thik karne ke alaava koi vikalp nahin tha
 He said, therefore, India took the position that it would be difficult to agree on the amendment (protocol of Amendment) procedure for trade facilitation agreement until our problem is resolved
 mantri ne kaha, hamen behad khushi he ki bharat or america ne dablutio main khaadya suraksha ke liye saarvajanik bhandaaran ke maamle se judaa matbhed is tarah safaltaapurvak sulajhaa liya he ki hamaari samasya kaa samaadhaan ho gaya
 This, he said, would end the deadlock in the WTO and would also open the way for implementing the Trade Facilitation Agreement
 sitaraman ne kaha, hamen bharosa he ki sadsy desh dablutio main is maamle ko sakaaratmak rup se aage badhayenge
 This will be a significant contribution of the WTO, which shows commitment to development
 unhone kaha, ham dablutio ke sadasyon se apil karte hai ki ve mantristareey sammelan kii ore se aam parishad main is maamle ko aage badhayen
 This will pave the way for encouraging WTO to achieve more such success

 In such a situation, it will be fun to see that the people of Uttarakhand will once again retain their tradition or else they will create history out of the box

 In Maharashtra, incidents of attacks on North Indians, especially those from Bihar, have increased in recent times
 raaj thakare kii party maharashtra navnirmaan sena (MNS) ke kaaryakartaaon ne mumbai ke alag-alag ilaakon main footpath par dukaan lagane vaale yaa pheri laga kar aajeevika kamaane vaale uttar bharatiyon ko nishaanaa banaaya
 a similar attack took place in Sangli
 beete kuch saal se mumbai samet maharashtra main is tarah kii ghatnaon par viraam laga hua tha
 What happened suddenly is that the MNS has again intensified such attacks
 mumbai main apravasi utar bhartiya ekta manch ke adhyaksh phool singh ne MNS kii is karrwai ki ninda karte hue raaj thakare ko khuli chitthee likhi he
 This letter states that if the people of Maharashtra get jobs by beating the people of Bihar or Uttar Pradesh, then they are ready to beat them
 bihar main in dinon nitish kumaar ke netritv mengediu-bijepi gathbandhansarkaar he
 In such a situation, there are reports of attacks on people from Maharashtra to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 2013 main jab nitish kumaar ne bijepi kaa saath chhod kar lalu prasad or congress se haath mila kar sarkaar banaai thi, tab se ikkaa-dukka ghatnaon ko chhodkar mumbai main MNS yaa shivasena ne bihar ke logon ke khilaaf aisi koi harakat nahin kii thi
 It is not hidden from anyone that both MNS and Shiv Sena have been targeting North Indians in the past to spark their regional politics
 haal main phir aise hamale hone par bihar ke raajnneetik galiyaaron main ye sawaal phir uthne lage hai ki bihar main jab bhi bijepi satta main hoti he to maharashtra main bihar ke logon par hamale kyon bad jate hai
 JDU spokesperson Neeraj Kumar says, 'maharashtra has a BJP ally Shiv Sena and it spews venom against BJP in its newspaper' Saamana 'every day
 MNS kaa bhi yahi haal he
 They do all this under the strategy of wooing Hindutva as well as Marathi voters
 aise main bijepi ko aatmamanthan kii jarurat he
 'people of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are being targeted in Mumbai and by coincidence, BJP is in power in both these states
 bijepi ye sahi nahi maanati he ki unki sarkarein bihar or utar pradesh main hone se maharashtra main utar bharatiyon ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 bjp's MLC Devesh Chandra Thakur in Bihar says that this time the attacks in Mumbai are not attacks on the Indians
 is bare main galat prachaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Thakur, who lives in Mumbai, believes that after the Elphinstone Over Bridge accident in the metropolis, such things came to the fore that people are difficult to walk on such bridges due to hawkers
 isi ko lekar MNS kii ore se kaha gaya ki aisi jagahon se pheri waalo ko hataaya jayega
 It also has South Indian and Marathi not only North Indian Ferries
 ’deveshchandra thakur ne ye bhi kaha ki 2012 membihar keshatabdi varsh samaaroh ke baad se mumbai yaa maharashtra main bihar ke logon par hamale kii ghatnaayen kareeb kareeb band ho gai thim
 But the question arises, who has given the MNS the right to remove the hawkers? Is there no alternative arrangement for these hawkers on behalf of the government? Phool Singh, president of the Niti Bhartiya Ekta Manch in Mumbai, wrote in an open letter to Raj Thackeray that if the people of Maharashtra were beaten up by the beating of North Indians If you get a job or employment, then i am ready to beat them
 phool singh ne likhaa he ki raaj thakare 27 oktober ko juhu par aakar unki pitayee karen or 10 marathiyon ko naukari den, main iske liye taiyaar hum

 goyal is galati ke liye soshal media par trol ho gaye
 Speaking on the country's economy, Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said in his address that to handle the economy, there is no need to look at any kind of mathematics or statistics related to it, if Einstein were to get involved in this mathematics, he would never go to gravity

 unhone kaha, 'aap un hisaab-kitaab main mat jaaie jo tivi par dekhte hai
