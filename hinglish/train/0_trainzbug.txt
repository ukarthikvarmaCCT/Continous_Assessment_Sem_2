 mangalvaar ko prasaarit big bos ke episod main manu punjabi or om swami ko unke saath galat tareeke se bartaav karte dekha gaya
 In this episode, Om Swamy incorrectly touches Sunny, which annoys the rest of the household members
 vahiin duusari taraf film 'sholay' kaa ek seen karte vakt manu punjabi ne unhen 'maal' kaha
 In this scene, Manu was playing the role of Veeru, Sunny Basanti and Swami Om Gabbar
 vije bani ne sabase pehle notice kiya ki swami om kathith taur par sani ko galat tareeke se chhu rahe the, unhone is bare main lopamudra raut ko bataaya
 Lopa did not see Swami doing this but still she went to Swami Om to talk about it
 swami om ne safai di ki vah kuch galat karnaa nahin chaah rahe the, lekin unki baat kaa yakeen nahin kiya gaya
 Later, Manu, Manveer Gurjar and Nitibha Kaul were seen talking to each other about Om Swamy's behavior
 nitibha ne kaha ki swami om ne sani ko galat tareeke se chuaa tha, iske jawaab main swami ne kaha ki agar sani is baat se sahaj nahin thim to vah unhen kah sakati thi
 To make the situation normal, Manu Punjabi intervened and told Swami that women are shy and do not talk about it
 unhone yah bhi suzav diya ki vah haath milakar kaam chalaa sakate the
 Swami Om said that he will take care of this from the future
 tippaniyan Manu also got scolded at the beginning of the day
 sholay act ke dauraan manu ne sani ko apni maal kaha, jiskaa bani ne virodh kiya
 Bani talked to Gaurav Chopra about this and said that he does not like boys making such comments on girls
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki ghar main kisi ne is bare main kuch bhi nahin kaha
 Gaurav said that no one heard it
 bani ne is bare main manu se baat karne kaa faisla kiya, unhone manu se poocha ki kya unka ek mahila ko maal kahana uchit he? is par manu ne kaha ki jab sani ne aapatti nahin kii to unhen bhi nahin kerani chahie
 VJ Bani first notices that Swami Om was allegedly touching Sunny incorrectly, he told Lopamudra Raut about this
 lopa ne swami ko aisa karte nahin dekha lekin phir bhi is bare main baat karne ke liye vah swami om ke paas gayi
 Swami Om clarified that he did not want to do anything wrong, but his words were not convinced
 baad main, manu, manavir gurjar or nitibha kaul aapas main om swami ke bartaav ko lekar baat karte najar aae
 Nitibha said that Swami Om had touched Sunny incorrectly, to this Swami said that if Sunny was not comfortable with this she could have told him
 sthiti ko saamaanya banane ke liye manu punjabi ne bich bachaav kiya or swami se kaha ki mahilaayein sharmili hoti hai or is bare main baat nahin karatin
 He also suggested that he could run the job with folded hands
 swami om ne kaha ki aage se vah is baat kaa dhyaan rakhenge
 The comments din kii shuruyaat main manu ko bhi daant padi
 During Sholay Act, Manu called Sunny his merchandise, which Bani opposed
 bani ne is bare main gaurav chopra se baat kii or kaha ki unhen ladakon kaa ladakiyon par is tarah kaa coment karnaa pasand nahin
 He also said that nobody in the house said anything about it
 is par gaurav ne kaha ki kisi ne yah suna nahin
 Bani decides to talk to Manu about this, he asks Manu if it is right for him to call a woman
 To this, Manu said that when Sunny did not object, he should not

 We spent some time with them chatting and drinking tea and the whole time they just know us as two tired trekkers! Whoever knows virat and me very closely, know that both of us live for such moments of genuine, simple and pure human connection
 It fills us with such joy and peace knowing that they just wanted to be kind to two random foreigners ( plus our guide ) without seeking anything in return

 22 navambar 1999- dobaaraa satta main lauti NDA sarkaar ne 13veen loksabhaa main mahila aarakshan vidheyak ko ek baar phir pesh kiya, lekin is baar bhi sarkaar is par sabhi ko sahamat nahin kar saki
 In 2002 and 2003 too, the bjp-led NDA government introduced the Women's Reservation Bill, but the government could not pass the bill despite assurances from the Congress and the Left
 may 2004- congress kii aguwai vaale sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (UPA) ne apane nunatam saajha kaarykram main mahila aarakshan vidheyak ko paarit karaane ke iraade kaa elaan kiya

 Today on Saturday, Pakistan will take on India to save their nose in the Champions Trophy, but before that, former fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has made a statement that can drop the morale of the Pakistani team
 yah bayaan tab aayaa he, jabaki pakistani team do match harkar toornament se pehle hi baahar ho chuki he
 Former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar continued his tough attitude against the country's cricket system, saying that most of the players of the Pakistani team are mentally disturbed
 akhtar ne kaha, ‘adhiktar khilaadi maidan par pradarshan nahin kar paa rahe hai, kyon? kyonki ve maansik rup se pareshaan hai
 They have many types of fears
 us dar ko hataanaa hoga or yah coach kaa kaam he
 The coach does not have to teach work sports
 ’unhone kaha ki pakistan cricket abhi ‘andhkaar yug’ se guzar rahaa he
 Akhtar made this stern remark after the team's poor performance in the Champions Trophy
 unhone kaha ki kharaab koching ke kaaran ballebaaj acha pradarshan nahin kar paa rahe hai or pakistani team ko nae coach kii jarurat he
 Team India had included young batsman and wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant in their World Cup squad with high hopes
 dilli ke is tabadatod ballebaaj ko world cap main openar shikhar dhawan kii jagah team main jagah di gai thi, lekin pant ek baar phir team or selectors kii ummiido par khare nahin utre or world cap ke semifinal mukaable main newjiland ke khilaaf 32 ran banaakar out ho gaye
 Pant was dismissed at a time when the team needed him the most, but forced by his habit, Rishabh Pant gave his wicket in the spin of playing a long shot after sticking once again
 rishabh kii ballebaaji ko dekhen to aisa lagata he ki unhen apane wicket kii keemat hi nahin pataa he
 Do they understand that they have been included in the team to score 30 to 40 runs
 agar unhen aisa lagata he to wo puri tarah se galat hai, kyonki jis 4 number par wo ballebaaji karne aate hai vahaan se khilaadi yaa to team ko jeet dilaataa he yaa phir team ko jeet kii dahalij par pahunchaata he or pant team ro sankat main chhodkar pavilion chale gaye
 In Pantavanade cricket, which did not come out of IPL mode, the number three and four key batsmen are given the opportunity to be called the backbone of the batting
 rishabh pant ke khel ko dekhakar aisa lagata he ki vah ipel ke mod se baahar nahin nikal paae hai
 Rishabh Pant's fast batting was highly praised in the IPL, where 30-40 runs made by the fast turn the match
 vanade cricket main jab team ko bharosemand ballebaaji kii jarurat thi, pant usee samay waapas chale gaye
 The question of who after Dhoni is still a matter of concern and introspection for the team management as well as the rest of the team is that they are being seen as a replacement for the current wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 dhoni ne team ko kai match jitaaye hai
 He has been known for his calm batting in difficult conditions and aggressive batting in favorable conditions
 balle or keeping kii takanic se dhoni ne team main captain tak kaa safar tay kiya tha
 Pant does not seem to be a replacement for Dhoni from his current game
 SANTNER GETS THE breakthrough!in his first over, Rishabh Pant looks to go big and picks out Colin de Grandhomme on the midwicket rope
 India are 71 / 5, and their recovery has hit a stumbling block
 In comes MS Dhoni

 com / yjnfxude0d— Cricket World Cup (@cricketworldcup)july 10, 2019lagaataar out hote rahe 30 se 40 ke score paraye pant kii kismat hi thi ki pehle shikhar dhawan ke ghayal hone ke baad unhen world cap kii team main jagah mili
 This series of his good luck did not stop here
 iske baad jab team india ke olerounder vijay shankar ghayal hue to unhen england ke khilaaf antim gyaarah main jagah mili
 Pant scored an innings of 32 runs in this match and after that he was dismissed for 48 runs in the match against Bangladesh
 vahiin iske baad apane tisare mukaable main srilankai team ke saamne wo mahaj 4 banaakar pavilion laut gaye
 Pant's failure continued in the semi-finals as well, and after spending time on the wicket again, gave up his wicket
 kya pant ne khatm kiya raidu kaa kariyar?pehle dhawan or baad main vijay shankar ke ghayal hone ke baad team main jab rishabh pant or mayank agarwal ko team main shaamil kiya gaya to ise niraash hokar ambati raidu ne antarrashtriya cricket se sanyas kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Rayudu, who was involved in the fight of number 4 for the last 4 years, was not included in the team even after Vijay Shankar was injured, it received a deep shock
 pehle pant ko chaar number par ballebaaji karakar coach shastri or captain kohli ne raidu kii ummiido par pani pheraa phir jab iske baad manyak agarwal ko world cap kii team main jagah di gai to raidu ne team india ke liye khilne kii ummid hi chhod di or cricket se sanyas kii ghoshnaa kar di
 In such a situation, the selection of Pant is not only raising questions, but this player has also ended Ambati Rayudu's career in a way

 Pakistan is going to have a general election on 25 July
 chunaav main janata se vot kii apil karne ke liye tamaam partiyaan mehnat kar rahi hai
 But these days Pakistan is making a lot of headlines for election campaigning
 darasal, yah poster cricketer se netaa bane imran khan kii " pakistan taharik-e-insaaf" yani pitiai kaa he
 In this poster of PTI candidate, two big Bollywood stars Amitabh Bachchan and Madhuri Dixit are also seen with the candidate
 ab sawaal uthta he ki aakhir pakistan ke aam chunaav main amitabh bachchan or maadhuri dikshit kii tasviir kyon lagaai gai he? hamane iskaa viral test karne kaa faisla kiya
 First of all, know what is the PTI candidate in the poster has used pictures of Madhuri Dixit and Amitabh Bachchan on their posters
 poster par do or tasviir lagi hui he
 Below these pictures are written Sardar Abbas Dogar and Sardar Owais Dogar
 sambhavat: sardaar abbaas dogar ummidavaar kaa naam he kyonki duusari tasviir kisi bachche kii lagi he jiskaa naam sardaar ovais dogar likhaa hua he
 Apart from this, the party's election symbol "balla" also has a mark
 vahiin poster ke sabase upree hisse main urdu main kuch likhaa hua he, jiskaa arth he- "main jhukaa nahin, main bika nahin, kahin chup-chupa ke khadaa nahin! jo date hue hai ladaai ke maidan main! mujhe un logon main talash kar
 "this picture, which is going viral on social media, is being described as the city of Multan in Pakistan
 log twitor par isko lekar pratikriya bhi de rahe hai

 com / lxwfk70dqk— Naila Inayat (@nailainayat)july 22, 2018aise main sawaal he ki kya vaaki main is tarah kaposter pakistanmen kisi party ke dwaara istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 For this we first turned to the city of Multan in Pakistan
 chunki poster imran khan kii party se judaa hua tha to hamane is baat kii padtaal kii, kya is party kaa koi sardaar abbaas dogar naamak ummidavaar is party se judaa hua he
 On investigation, it was found that a total of 14 candidates of the PTI party in Multan are trying their luck in the electoral fray, but no one named Sardar Abbas Dogar is contesting the election nor does the person appearing in the poster belong to Multan
 is maamle main hamane vahaan aaj news ke sthaneey patrkaar nasir jahir se baat kii to unhone bhi kaha ki poster main jo chunaav chinh he vah pitiai kaa he lekin multan main is party kaa koi bhi ummidavaar sardaar abbaas dogar ke naam se nahin he or na hi poster par chhapi tasviir kisi ummidavaar kii he
 He further told that in Pakistan, the candidates in their poster banner, in addition to the photo, election symbol, also mark the number given by the Election Commission, which is not on this viral picture
 lekin yah baat ho sakati he ki shaayad viral tasviir multan kaa na hokar pakistan ke kisi or chunaav kshetra kaa ho
 So we tried to find out if the person in the picture is not of Multan, then where is it? The news proved to be false
 Now we talked to Anila Khwaja, the international media head of the "pakistan tehreek-e-insaf" party
 He said that the person seen in the picture is not in PTI nor is it contesting from anywhere in Pakistan
 anila ne yah bhi kaha kii is tarah ke saikadon poster pakistan kii sadakon par pitiai ko badnaam karne ke liye lage hue hai
 We are investigating who are the people who are spreading such rumors on social media
 aise main yah khabar viral test main juthi sabit hui
 This picture going viral is neither real and Amitabh Bachchan and Madhuri Dixit have any connection with the elections in Pakistan

 Is my promise aapako niraash nahin hone duungaa
 i will not let your love break
 milane ke teen ghante ke andar shartiya phayda
 i have made millions of lives
 meraa naam he baba bengali
 At the same address for years
 hamaari koi shakha nahin he
 No no
 ye sab baba-tantric dhongi hai
 Had he been real, he would have run such a small shop
 satv nahin he, satya nahin he, tatv nahin he
 Baba is one who has a large ashram on the river bank
 hajaaron bhakt hon
 There should be stories of their devotion
 maine bachapan se suni hai
 You also listen and listen
 ek baar bhandara ho rahaa tha
 Vegeta ran out
 puri khatm ho gai
 Ghee is over
 pani baras gaya
 Choose one of these four options and fill in the name of Baba of your choice
 kadaahi main ghi nahin tha
 Baba asked for water from the pond and poured it there
 phir teen roj tak tel kii jarurat nahin padi
 Oh, the food and drink are already there in the world
 kuch sone kii sapane kii baat karo, to jaane
 Babu will incur some expenses ek bora chanaa kharido or ek murti yaa pathar yaa phir shraddha ke duusare paale main ho to ek kabr talash lo
 Choose the place according to need
 sadak kaa kinaaraa kabjana he yaa phir kisi ke khet se rasta nikalvaanaa he
 Now go in the night, dig a pit and let the inner bore be soaked with water
 uske upar rakh do jald prakat hone ko aatur ati pracheen bhagwaan
 Look dream after a few days
 bataao, phalani jagah gade hai bhagwaan
 Tann's voice will be in two to four spades
 bhagwaan milenge
 Illegal possession will be found and then speak Hari
 kirthan, bhandara, kahaniyaan
 Or just put a green sheet at some place and keep incense sticks on the week
 jald is fakir kii kirapa ke charche hawa ke saath bahenge
 a fair will be held and the vow will be completed
 nahin nahin
 It looks like a start up business
 hamen to jamaa jamaaya chahie
 Like the curd that accompanies parantha at the deluxe dhaba on the highway
 tod do sapana
 Now see the reality
 kya najar aa rahaa he
 Something is hazy
 booti kii chunti phir kaato ek baar
 Yes ab sab kuch dikh rahaa he
 Baba has just woken up
 baba ko hamaare baba ne jab dekha tha
 Even then Baba looked like this
 baba avtari purush hai
 Which he touches
 changa ho jaataa he
 Baba is beautifying the world
 baba sarkaron kii sarkaar hai
 Baba can make gold
 kya suna
 Can make Mona
 are nahin-nahin, sona
 
 
 Gold
 magar aaj baba ji chup hai
 He has a special dream at night
 par baba sabko sapana nahin bataaenge
 Will tell the minister from a monk
 phir mantri santari ko bataaenge or lagegaa ek majamaa
 Baba has told the treasure pin
 ab bas batan dabaao
 Drive the hoe and snooze
 bade bade kalshon main rakhi asharfiyaan or sona nikalegaa
 There will also be a pair of snakes nearby
 hajaaron barason se isaki hifaazat karata
 Parts
 
 
 munshi daavatein khaali kar denge hisaab lagane main
 If it gets, then the hands of some lakh girls will be yellow
 utta milegaa to kis grah tak sadak ban jaaegi
 Oh no, we did not become
 baba ne bana diya
 Gave his thud to ab sab log aankh kholkar or phir milakar kaho

 com / nfuzwlg85l loksabhaa chunaav ke khatm hote hi ab bhartiya janata party ne rajya main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon kii taiyaari shuru kar di he
 The party is now eyeing Delhi as well
 sutron kii maane to apni ranneeti ke tahat BJP ne tay kiya he ki vah rajya sanghathan main jimmedaari nibhaa rahe netaaon or jiladhyakshon ko vidhansabha kaa tikat nahin degi
 This is so that the leader can play a big responsibility in the organization and not be busy in his own election
 isse pehle 2017 ke MCD chunaav main bhi bijepi ne kuch aisa hi kiya tha or maujuuda parshadon ko tikat nahin diya tha
 Because there were reports of public outrage against all of them
 bijepi rajya main pichley 22 saal se satta se baahar he, aise main is baar jor-shor se chunaav kii taiyaari main juty he
 Significantly, the BJP has often followed the policy of one man one post
 haalanki, party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah is samay desh ke grih mantri hone ke saath-saath bhaajapa pramukh bhi hai
 According to BJP sources, as soon as the assembly elections are near, the process of asking for the tickets of district presidents, office bearers has started
 aise main vah sirf apane hi chunaav main naa biji ho or sanghathan ko nuksaan ho jaay, isliye aisa faisla liya ja saktaa he
 In giving tickets, the party can this time give opportunity to those who are constantly working on the ground and whose chances of winning elections are high
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bhi kuch aisa hi hua tha
 In which the leaders were demanding a Lok Sabha ticket in exchange for a post in the party
 ab sutron kii maane to party kaa maananaa he ki agar sanghathan main pad or tikat saath-saath miltaa he to party ko hi nuksaan ho saktaa he
 However, when State President Manoj Tiwari was asked a question on this, he called such reports wrong
 bijepi kii taraf se november ke aasapaas dilli main ek survey bhi karaayaa jayega
 On the one hand, while the meetings of the BJP have gone, preparations for the membership campaign have also intensified
 jo ki 6 july se shuru hoga
 Significantly, Delhi may have assembly elections in February next year
 pichley chunaav main AAP ne 70 main se 67 siton par jeet darj kii thi, to vahiin bhaajapa sirf 3 seat jeet pai thi
 Leader of Opposition in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly Vasundhara Raje on Friday took charge as BJP state president
 bhaajapa pradesh mukhyalay main raaje ne bhaajapa ke pradesh prabharee captain singh solanki, sah sachiv kirit saummaya, saansad om prakaash maathur, purv saansad ram das agarwal, purv bhaajapa pradesh adhyaksh dow
 Arun Chaturvedi, former Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria, former Minister Ghanshyam Tiwari took charge as State BJP President in presence of several senior leaders and hundreds of activists and supporters
 raaje ne padbhaar grahan karne ke baad kaha ki vah sabhi ko saath lekar kaam karengi or janata kaa raaj dobaaraa aayega
 a Delhi court on Saturday extended the judicial custody of arrested diplomat Madhuri Gupta for 14 days for allegedly providing confidential information to Pakistani intelligence officials
 mukhya metropolitan magistrate kaveri baweja kii adaalat ne gupta (53) ko phir nau july tak nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya
 He was produced in court on Saturday
 isse pehle 31 may ko uski nyaayik hiraasat badhaai gai thi
 The Delhi Police arrested Gupta on 22 April after arriving from Islamabad
 use islamabad se bulaayaa gaya tha
 She was the second secretary in the Press and Information Branch there
 police ne abtak gupta ke maamle main aropatr daayar nahin kiya he jise giraftaar ke 90 dinon ke andar daayar karnaa hota he
 On one hand, the SP is confident of winning again in the by-election in the Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat, which was vacant after the resignation of Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, on the other hand, the BJP has made a dent in the sp's stronghold Is engaged in the exercise of putting uttar pradesh main 11 vidhansabha siton ke saath hi mainpuri sansadeey seat ke liye bhi upachunaav 13 sitambar ko hona he
 In the by-election in Mainpuri parliamentary seat, Mulayam has fielded his elder brother's grandson Tej Pratap Yadav
 isse pehle upachunaav ke tahat hi mulaayam ne apni bahu or mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kii patni dimple yadav kii raajnneeti main entry karai thi
 Now he has fielded the third generation through a by-election
 tej pratap yadav philhal sapa ke block pramukh hai
 To win Tej Pratap, veteran SP leaders have camped in Mainpuri
 shivpal yadav lagaataar mainpuri main date hue hai, jabaki mulaayam singh mainpuri main 6 or 7 sitambar ko do din rahakar chunavi ranneeti ko antim rup denge
 SP leader Dr CP Rai said, "mainpuri by-election will be unilaterally in favor of SP
 yahaan modi kaa dhol nahin bajegaa
 You see that before the general election, inflation, black money and corruption were the main issues for them, but their issues have also changed after coming to power
 " Here, Prem Singh from BJP is a candidate from Shakya Mainpuri
 bijepi ko ummid he ki narendra modi kii saakh ke sahare vah mulaayam ke garh main send lagane main kaamyaab rahegi
 The campaign for the by-election is in the hands of senior leader and Union Minister Kalraj Mishra, Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath and State President Laxmikant Vajpayee
 bijepi ke pradesh pravaktaa vijay bahadur pathak kehete hai, "upachunaav main kendriya mudde to haaavee rahenge hi, saath hi yahaan kushasan ke khilaaf bhi ladaai he
 This time the fight will be thorny here and we are confident that BJP will be able to make a dent in the SP stronghold
 " Just a few days ago there was news that actress Vidya Balan is pregnant
 magar ab unki shaadi ke hi mushkil main hone kii charchaa he
 It is being told that everything is not going well between Vidya Balan and her producer husband Siddharth Roy Kapoor
 isaki vajah ek nai actress he, jiske saath siddharth kii nazdikiyon ke chalate vidya naaraaz hai
 Vidya Balan dismissed the news of pregnancy through a statement
 magar is algaav par unhone chuppi saadh rakhi he
 According to the news published in the English newspaper Deccan Chronicle, Siddharth Roy Kapoor is busy promoting a new actress loudly
 vidya patidev ke is rukh se katai khush nahin hai
 Due to this, he has also canceled all his foreign tours
 puri industry ipha aword ke liye america gai, magar vidya mumbai se nahin hilin
 It is reported that Vidya is doing all this to keep an eye on Siddharth
 akhbaar ke mutabik siddharth shaadi ke baad ek or actress ke kareeb ja chuke the
 This happened when Vidya was often outside the country in connection with the shoot
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki in sabake chalate vidya or siddharth ke bich lagaataar jhagade ho rahe hai
 Due to these promotions of Vidya Balan's next film Bobby Jasoos are also delayed
 vidya pichley kuch hafton se apane mata-pita ke chembur sthit ghar bhi baar baar ja rahi hai
 People close to the actress say that Vidya will do everything possible to save her marriage
 siddharth roy kapur kii yah teesri shaadi he
 He was married to childhood love
 duusari patni produsar ke taur par kaam karti thim
 They divorced in 2011
 rajdhani main ceiling ke virodh main 13 march ko dilli puri tarah band rahi
 All big and small business organizations supported the bandh and about 7 lakh traders did not open shop shutters
 is band ke chalate sarkaar ko karodon ke rajasav kaa ghaataa to hua hi saath hi dukandaaron kaa nuksaan bhi lakhon main he
 Due to this shutdown, rickshawlers and auto owners have also faced a lot of problems
 bazaaron se savaariyaan uthaane or bazaaron tak savaariyaan le jane vaale auto rickshaw chaalak aaj khaali baithe hue hai
 He has not been sowing since morning, due to which he is very angry with the Central Government and the State Government
 dilli ke sabase bheed bhaad vaale bazaaron main shumaar lajpat nagar bazaar bhi aaj puri tarah se band he
 This market is a source of livelihood for thousands of rickshaws and auto drivers and their income is negligible due to the bandh
 lajpat nagar ke baahar kareeb 12 saal se rickshaw chalaa rahe manmohan kaa kahana he ki sarkaar garibon kii kabhi nahin sunati
 We are daily eaters
 aaj ek bhi sawari subah se nahin mili he
 It is not likely that anyone will get by evening
 aaj ghar khaali haath janaa padegaa
 i do not know how bread will be made
 sarkaar ko hamaare bare main sochna chahie
 We are also dependent on markets should not be sealed
 amar colony marketbhi ceiling ke chalate band he
 Rickshaws and auto drivers have also suffered direct damage here
 kareeb 1 hafte ho gaye hai band ko, jisase yahaan rojaanaa 5 se 6 sau rupye kamaane vaala ek chota sa rikhshavala bhi prabhavit hua he
 Rakesh, who has been hauling goods from shops here for years, says, "we were hauling goods from here
 acchhee khaasi aamadani ho jaati thi, jiske sahare maine lone lekar makaan kharida tha
 It has been 1 week now and the income has been halved due to the shutdown
 kaise lone duungaa, bacchon kii fees kaise duungaa samaj nahin aa rahaa
 There is no hope from the government either
 kuch aise hi halatadillike sadar bazaar main bane hue hai
 Here the handlers and rickshaw-pullers have been facing difficulties for the last 40 days
 pichley maheene sadar bazaar main hui ceiling ke baad se inkaa kaam aadha ho gaya he
 Some have shifted from here to another place
 kyon ki kaam na ke baraabar he
 Overall, auto and rickshaw drivers are suffering more than the loss due to sealing in Delhi to shopkeepers, workers and daily laborers
 duniya bhar ke musalmaan har saal haj ke liye saudi arab jate hai
 The Saudi government gives India a fixed quota in proportion to the population of Muslims which the central government allocates to the state governments
 aamtaur par ye kaam central haj cameti, mumbai ke jariye sambandhit rajya kii state haj cameti karti he
 The central government has been giving subsidy on Haj pilgrimage to Indian Muslims, but the Modi government has abolished it today
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki haj sabsidi kya he?duniya ke musalamaanon kii tarah bharat ke musalmaan bhi saudi arab haj ke liye jate hai
 The government itself bears some part of the travel expenses of Indian Hajis as subsidies
 ye sabsidi unheen haj yatriyon ko milti he, jo haj cameti ke jariye jate hai
 The rest who go through private tour service are not given any kind of subsidy
 darasal, haj yatriyon ko milane vaali sabsidi kaa sabase bada hissaa hawaii yatra par kharch kiya jaataa he
 The Ministry of Civil Aviation, Government of India provides these subsidies through the Haj Committee of India
 ye paisa haj yatriyon ke bajaay air india ko sidhe diya jaataa he
 The Haj subsidy in India is around Rs 650 crore
 ye aamtaur par saudi arab jane ke liye hawaii kiraaye ke rup main di jaati hai
 Muslims believe that subsidies are being given to airlines and not to them
 haj yatri ko do category main yatra karne kaa avasar miltaa he
 First Green category and second Azizia category
 pichley saal (2016) main haj yatra kaa kharchaa kuch is prakaar tha
 Green category cost of stay in Mecca, Rs 81,000, cost of staying in Madina, Rs 9,000, ticket of airline, Rs 45,000, other expenses, Rs 76,320, Rs 21,1320, Rs 21,1320; Rs
 Now the entire game is for airlines tickets, for which Rs
 45,000 is charged from Haj pilgrims
 sarkari taur par airline kaa aane jane kaa tikat 70,340 rupee kaa bataaya jaataa hai jisamen yatri ko keval 45000 dene hote hai baaki kaa paisa sabsidi ke rup main sarkaar sidhe airlines ko detii he
 There is also a math here
 yani dilli kii jagah agar aap oreisha yaa goa se haj ke liye ravaanaa hote hai yaa chennai se jate hai to uskaa tikat kharch bhi alag-alag hoga
 Explain that the Supreme Court had criticized the subsidy given by the government for the Haj pilgrimage and asked to end it
 court ne ise 10 saal kii samay-seemaa main dhire-dhire khatm karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 Since 2006, the Ministry of External Affairs and a Parliamentary Committee on Transport and Tourism had suggested the elimination of Haj subsidy within a time limit
 agle paanch saal ke liye haj niti tay karne ke liye bani ucchstareey cameti cameti ne bhi sabsidi ko khatm karne kii vakaalat kii thi, jise ab manjuuri de di gai he
 Another case related to Law Minister Salman Khurshid and his trust has come up
 khurshid par farrukhabad ke ek shaks ne aarope lagaaya he ki paudhe lagane ke liye use patte par mili 25 acre jameen ko raaton-raat khurshid ke trust ko de diya gaya
 The comments is jameen par unhone kareeb teen hajaar paudhe bhi lagaae, lekin 1995 main is jameen kii lij 100 rupee salanaa kii dar se salmaan khurshid ke trust ko de di gai
 Since then, construction work of the hospital is going on on this land, which has not yet been completed
 mujeeb khan ke mutabik, pichley 17 saalon se ban rahe is aspataal ke peeche kai gadabadi ho sakati hai, jinaki nishpaksh jaanch honi chahie
 He also planted about three thousand saplings on this land, but in 1995 the lease of this land was given to Salman Khurshid's trust at the rate of Rs 100
 tab se is jameen par aspataal kaa nirmaan kaary chal rahaa he jo ki abhi tak bhi puraa nahin ho paaya he
 According to Mujib Khan, there may be many disturbances behind this hospital being built for the last 17 years, which should be examined objectively
 mujeeb khan ke mutabik, pichley 17 saalon se ban rahe is aspataal ke peeche kai gadabadi ho sakati hai, jinaki nishpaksh jaanch honi chahie
 He said, "we have a market, and if we make a film without a good story, it won't be called honest filmmaking
" 
 
 lekin koun jaanata he, yadi mere pita koi acchhee kahani likh daalate hai, jis tarah unhone pehle likh di thi, to hamen koi nahin roak paaegaa
 
 
 We can make that anytime
 
 
 " The script of both the films of 'bahubali' series is based on the story written by Rajendrauli's father Vijayendra Prasad, and the story of Hindi film superstar Salman Khan's superhit film 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' was also written by Vijayendra Prasad
 
 
 'bahubali' series kii donon filmon kii patakatha rajamauli ke pita vijayendra prasad dwaara likhi kahani par aadhaarit he, or hindi filmon ke superstar salmaan khan kii superhit film 'bajrangi bhaijan' kii kahani bhi vijayendra prasad ne hi likhi thi
 
 
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a speech during the vote of thanks on the President's address to the Lok Sabha on Wednesday
 dedh ghante ke bhaashan main piem modi ne congress par jamkar waar kiya
 Even before the pm's speech began, the Telugu Desam Party, the bjp's ally in the Congress and the central government, was shouting slogans in the House
 ye narebaaji puure bhaashan ke dauraan jari rahi
 Congress MP Ranjit Ranjan was also the frontrunner in raising slogans against PM Modi
 ajtak se baat karte hue unhone kaha ki piem modi ne pichley chaar saalon me logon ko pani pilaayaa he, ab ham unhen pani pilaate hue chunaav main lekar jaaenge
 He said that the whole country was listening to this speech of PM, we had raised the talk of the people in the House
 log ab jumale nahin sunanaa chaahate hai
 When we raised slogans against the Prime Minister, this time no minister from the ruling party was raised

 com / a2txyvfqga— aaj tak (@aajtak)february 7, 2018ranjan ne kaha ki jab ham piem modi ke khilaaf narebaaji kar rahe the, tab hamen congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or purv adhyaksh sonia gandhi kaa puraa sahyog mila
 But during this time no BJP MP spoke in support of PM Modi
 iskaa matlab he ki bijepi saansad bhi piem modi se naaraaz hai
 In a conversation with Aaj Tak, Ranjit Ranjan also told how he raised slogans against PM Modi in the House
 jumale baaji nahin chalegi,bhaashan baaji nahin chalegi,dramebaaji nahin chalegi,rafel deal kaa kya hua,bhrashtachar kaa kya hua,kaale dhan kaa kya hua,rahul ne bhi kiya warpm ke bhaashan par rahul ne media se baat karte hue kaha ki ham sabhi unka bhaashan sunanaa chaahate the, hamaare kai sawaal hai jinamein andhra pradesh kaa mudda tha or rafel deal kaa mudda tha
 Something has gone wrong in the Rafale deal
 rahul bole ki piem loksabhaa main 1 ghante se zyada bole lekin rafel deal par kuch bhi nahin kaha
 Rahul said that the PM spoke campaign in the Lok Sabha and did nothing
 ullekhneey he ki guuruuvaar ko bhi vipaksh ne puraane 500-1000 rupee ke notebandi ke faisle ke khilaaf vipaksh ne jabardast lamabandi karte hue faisle se samaaj ke garib tabake ke logon ko ho rahi pareshaani se sarkaar ko avgat karaayaa
 Along with this, the opposition accused the government of leaking this decision to their loved ones
 is bich kai varisht kendriya mantriyo ne vipaksh ke in aaropon ko sire se nakaarte hue vipaksh se poocha ki kya ve kaale-dhan se aazaadee paanaa chaahate hai yaa nahin
 Meanwhile, several senior Union ministers rejected the allegations of opposition and asked the opposition whether they want to get freedom from black money or not
 aresas ke prachaar pramukh manmohan vaidya ke aarakshan khatm karne ke bayaan par vipakshi partiyon ne unhen nishane par lenaa shuru kar diya he
 Mayawati, the national president of the Bahujan Samaj Party, sharply criticized Vaidya's statement, saying that the RSS is in dire need to change its wrong and casteist mindset in the Constitution and in the national interest

 Students sitting on a dharna for 16 days were seen doing bhajan-kirtan on Friday
 isse pehle biechayu prashasan ne daawa kiya tha ki chaatro ne hadtaal waapas le lee he
 From Thursday, the BHU administration's efforts to convince the students had intensified
 guuruuvaar shaam ko chaatro ke ek dal ne kulapati se mulaakaat bhi kii
 Written answers to some questions from students were sought from BHU
 jisapar biechayu kii ore se 10 din ke bheetar sawaalon kaa likhit jawaab dene kaa aashwaasan bhi diya gaya tha
 Since then, the administration has been continuously claiming that the students' picket is over
 chaatro kii maane to unka andolan majbootee se aage bad rahaa he or jari rahegaa
 The administration claimed that the students' strike was over
 Earlier, it was claimed by the BHU administration that the students of Sanskritology, Religion Department have decided to call off the protest against the appointment of Muslim Professor Feroz Khan as Assistant Professor
 
 biechayu ke pravaktaa rajesh singh ne kaha tha ki chaatro ke saath kai daur kii baatcheet ke baad shuukravaar ko kakshaen phir se shuru hone kii ummid he
 The VC assured the students at the meeting that they had said that the semester examinations were about to begin
 sanskrit vibhaag ke taale guuruuvaar shaam ko khole gaye
 Explain that the students had closed the department on November 7 when they started their protest
 chaatro ke saath guuruuvaar ko hui baithak main visi rakesh bhatnagar, dean professor vindhyeshwari prasad mishra, varisht shikshak or vishvavidhyalay ke adhikari maujuud rahe
 According to a university official, the protesting students submitted a memorandum to the university administration with a list of demands
 mukhya procter opi raay or vibhaag ke pramukh ne chaatro ko aashwaasan diya ki unke sawaalon kaa jawaab 10 dinon ke bheetar diya jayega, jiske baad chaatro ne dharna pradarshan band karne kaa faisla kiya
 According to Chakrapani Ojha, a phd scholar who is leading the protest, the protest is not the appointment of a non-hindu in the Religion Department but of Feroze Khan (BHU professor)
 agar yahi niyukti vishvavidhyalay ke kisi anya department main sanskrit adhyaaapak ke rup main hoti to virodh nahin hota
 It is necessary to understand that anyone of any religion can read and study Sanskrit, but when the person of another religion talks about religious science, there is no credibility

 The seven subsidiaries of Lanco Group, working in the infrastructure sector of Congress MP Rajagopal Lagdapati, have been given commissioning certificates by a Rajasthan government agency to complete the work of these plants in early January, while much of the work was incomplete

 India Today visited the Escandra site between February 4 and 7, long after the scheduled completion of the work, and found that very little work had been done
 35 megawatt bijli paidaa karne ke liye 1,70,000 saura panel kii jagah 1,000 se bhi kam panel lage the
 Most of these were not working either

 Had deposited bank guarantee
 samjhaute main pariyojnaon ko puraa karne main 9 janvari se 9 farvari tak kii deree hone par is guarantee kaa 20 pratishat jabt hone kaa praavdhaan he
 There is a provision of penalty up to 40% on the guarantee amount for delay after 9 February and after it is pulled till 9 March
 anubandh main 10 march tak kaam puraa nahin hone par samoochee guarantee jabt ho jaaegi
 In other words, the company raised a total of Rs 85 crore
 bachaa liye hai
 The agreement also provided that the delay would be 1 day per MW after 10 March
 jurmaana prati din dena hoga
 Then, if the company is not able to complete the projects by 31 March, it would have become a white elephant for Lanco as it was owned by the government-owned Electricity Trading Corporation Limited

 RRECL issued one on 7 January and three commissioning certificates on 9 January

 But until the beginning of February, there was no sign of electricity generation

 India Today spoke to NVVN officials with evidence on 13 February
 adhikariyon ne mana ki unhone certificate ko phase vailu par liya tha, isliye koi jurmaana nahin lagaaya
 NVVN issued a press release on 19 February which stated, 'for the first time the last date of 9 January has passed, Lanco's three companies and 11 others have Rs 7 crore
 bhunaa liye hai
 India Today found that the three companies linked to Lanco were penalized on January 10
 lekin envivien ne lanko se judi anya 4 companiyon ko abhi tak dandit nahin kiya he jabaki uske paas is baat kaa saboot he ki unhone 9 janvari kii samay seemaa keval kaagaj par puri kii he
 Now RRECL is trying to get its hands off the certificate
 uskaa kahana he ki uske liye 'kamishning' kaa arth bijli utpaadan ke liye logisticks kaa sahi jagah lag janaa he, lekin iskaa arth bijli kaa utpaadan hona nahin he
 RRECL Director (technical) M

 Vijayvargiya told India Today on 19 February, 'since we have now come to know that not all panels are in place, we are informing NVVN that these are partial commissioning certificates
 ’ lekin envivien ke siio anil agarwal jor dekar kehete hai, ‘kamishning kaa arth pariyojna kaa puraa hona or bijli utpaadan ke liye taiyaar rahanaa he
 Of the 9 companies linked to Lanco, only two are owned by him
 anya companiyon par unke sharholding pattern ke jariye lanko kaa niyantran he
 This was done by following NSM rules
 in niyamon ke mutabik ek company keval ek hi contract paa sakati he
 Dushyant Singh, son of former Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and BJP MP from Jhalawar in Rajasthan, says, "the entire conspiracy has been exposed and officials are now trying to smuggle

 pradhan ne 3 farvari ko teen sadasyeey cameti se jaanch karwaane ke aadesh die the
 The committee, which also included the Director (investigation) in the Union Ministry of Company Affairs, was to investigate whether Lanco used 7 front companies in addition to its two companies to get 40 per cent solar power contracts under NSM in 2010
 Was it or not
 enesaim ke tahat boli ke pehle charan main lanko ke swaamitv vaali do or uske sahyog vaali 7 companiyaan 9 saura urja pariyojnaayen paane main safal rahi thim
 India Today has learned that Lanco acquired 100% preferential holding in these companies after signing these companies on contracts
 yah enesaim ke niyamon kaa saraasar ulanghan tha jo pariyojna ke shuru hone ke baad ek saal tak sharholding pattern main kisi tarah ke badlaav par roak lagaate hai
 NVVN says that in July 2011, while examining the closure sheets of the companies, it found a change in the shareholding pattern
 usne bataaya, ‘hamane agast, 2011 main thekon ko nirast karne ke liye sabhi nau lanko companiyon ko notice bheja
 The matter was settled by December 2011 as Lanco agreed to restore ownership of the parent companies'
 india today ne askandra kaa daura karne par paaya ki sabhi companiyaan ek hi chhatari ke neeche kaam kar rahi thim or ek hi jagah sthit thim
 India Today sent a questionnaire to Lanco on 9 February
 lanko ne 16 farvari ko jawaab diya, ‘pariyojnaayen grid se judi hai or bijli kaa utpaadan kar rahi hai
 He also said that his shares in the companies he is being accused of using as a front are within a reasonable range
 india today ne kendriya naveen evam navikarniya urja mantralay ko bhi ek prashnawali bheji thi
 On 5 March, the ministry said that after receiving the questionnaire, it has sent a team to verify all solar projects in the country
 janvari main rajasthan or gujarat ke mukhyamantriyon ke bich vivaad chhidaa tha ki saura urja utpaadan main koun aage he

 bihar main do sharp shooter pichley chaar dinon se khuleam gum rahe hai
 With the official gun
 itnaa hi nahin ye donon shooter ab tak dhai sau shikaar bhi kar chake hai
 It is difficult to say how far the count will go next
 kyonki donon shikari ab bhi vahaan deraa daale hai
 But this victim has raised a question
 sawaal vahi purana
 The question is, is it right to shoot unruly animals? And the question is whether it is permissible for humans to suffer harm because of animals? After all, why have orders been ordered to shoot these unarmed animals? Why are they being shot by running? Is Kanyalgai a victim of zayaz? Does it not come in the list of protected animals? And the biggest question is whether Nilgai is a cow? Or is it just a cow by name? The battle between humans and animals is against the shoot and site order of one Nilgai, and the other has its own arguments
 kul mila kar labboloab ye he ki jab shikari sarkari hai to inbejubaan kii jaan kaise bache? or agar inhen baksh diya jaae or yun hi khulaa chhod diya jaae to phir kai gharon kaa chulhaa bujh jaataa he
 That is, the fight is directly between man and animal
 ab inamen koun sahi he or koun galat ye aap tay karen
 The waste of a year's hard work is also not good
 to in jaanwaron ke jeene kaa tarika bhi sahi nahin kaha saktaa
 So what is the solution only for his death? Nilgai's ravaged cultivation is in Mokama area of bihar
 yahaan ek bade hisse par kheti hoti he
 And here on a large part Nilgai also resides in large numbers
 saalon se hota ye aa rahaa he ki jaise hi fasal khadi hoti he nilgai kaa jhund kheton par dhaava bol kar unhen barbaad kar detii he
 This issue of farmers is so serious that the leader also thrives here who talks about the Nilgai issue
 bas isiilie maujuuda vidhayak kii guzarish par hyderabad se do shooter yahaan pahunch gaye or shikaar shuru ho gaya
 The JDU MLA had raised more than 10 thousand indigo cows in Mokama Tall, covering 1 lakh 67 thousand hectares of land stretching from Fatuha to Carpenter near Mudapatna
 is puure ilaake main aasapaas koi ghanaa jangal bhi nahin he
 So all the Nilgai are around the majority of the population and consider these open areas as their home
 ab yahaan tak to thik he
 But the problem is that when these indigo cows come out in the herd, farm-by-field havoc
 fasal se lekar subjiyan tak barbaad kar detii hai
 Till now domestic methods were being tried to drive out the indigo farmers who had become enemies of the farmers
 lathi-danda lekar kisaan raat-din fasalon kii paharedaari karne lage
 But when the herd of indigo cows attacked the fields, what crops and what farmers
 kisi ko bhi nahin bakhshati
 Ultimately, the ruling party's JDU legislator appealed to the Nitish government
 or nitish sarkaar ne centre se
 This was followed by two famous sharp shooters called the Nilgai from Hyderabad
 hyderabad se bulaae gaye sharp shooterhyderabad se mokama pahunche sharp shooters kii team kii aguwai kar rahe hai nawab shafqat ali khan

 As soon as his team gets information about a herd of nilgai from the villagers, they immediately set out for the mission with their telescope rifles
 pichley chaar dinon main hi ye ab tak dhai sau nilgai kaa shikaar kar chake hai
 'the motive is to save the farmer's field', said the suitor Nawab Shafat Ali Khan, 'our motive is not to kill
 maarna aakhri opshan he
 Our aim is to save the farmer's farm from the Nilgai
 to is makasad se ham kaam karte hai
 Of the 200 that we have killed in this village, 90 per cent more males are killed

 These clearances have been given for a total of 31 districts
 jahaan ek anumaan ke mutabik pichley 10 saalon main nil gaayon kii sankhya 25 hajaar tak pahunch gai he
 The reason for increasing number of indigo cows is believed to be in the category of protected organism till now
 abhi tak nil gaayon ko maarna jurm tha
 Due to which the number of indigo cows increased
 ab nitish sarkaar ne nil gaayon ko sangrakshit shrenee se baahar kar diya he
 However, experts consider only humans responsible for the terror of indigo cows

 He informs his pion that he will take about an hour to study the case
 jaankaree ke mutabik, aaj bel par sunwaayee ke dauraan jaj joshi vakeelon kii daleelein sunne ke baad thodi der rukate or uske baad kaagaj par kuch nots le rahe the

 He loses and sits on an empty seat of the bus and starts pleading his innocence
 lekin jab maamla range haathon pakade jane kaa ho, to bhala koi uski daleelon par kyon dhyaan de
 This manly act reminds of the stunts of Manchale, how he could even sit in an empty bus by going to the other side, but he deliberately came close to her not only by looking at her alone, but pretending to fall on her on the pretext of the speed of the bus Started doing it too
 lekin jab harakatein had se bad gayi to phir usne khud hi morcha sambhala or use daboch liya
 Now the bet was over
 ab wo naa sirf manachale kii dhunaai kar rahi thi, balki use dhakelti hui bas main aage kii taraf badhane lagi

 Ajit Jogi's party state president of Go Sevak Cell of Chhattisgarh Janata Congress Shankar Rajak and his associate Siddhant Mahant have been arrested in Korba
 police ne unhen adaalat main pesh kiya, vahaan se donon ko nyaayik hiraasat ke liye jail main daakhil kara diya gaya
 Police had registered a case of cheating against both the accused
 police ke mutabik shankar rajak or siddhant mahant ke khilaaf 34 peediton ne dhokhadhadi kii shikaayat darj karai thi
 Someone had filed a complaint of recovery of between Rs 75,000 and Rs 1 lakh in the name of securing jobs in SECL and other government offices
 16 logon ne apni shikaayat main kaha tha ki unhen jameen adhigrahan main unki jameen kamunh maanga muaavjadilwane ke liye jogi congress ke netaaon ne bataur token mani dedh-dedh lakh rupaye vasule
 The complainants gave an amount of about Rs 29 lakh through checks and registered stamp papers
 aise peediton kii police ne shikaayat darj kii lekin jin logon ne nagad rakam di un shikayatakartaaon ke prakaran ko police ne filhal vivechna main liya he
 It is being told that development work is to be done around the coal mines of South East Cold Fields Limited in Katghora area of korba
 is ilaake main badi aabaadi sthaneey logon kii he
 The accused showed many people living here that they would be asked for compensation during the acquisition of land
 basharte wo bataur token mani ek lakh se dedh lakh rupaye tak kii rakam pehle jamaa kara den
 It is being told that from the year 2013 to 2015, many people had greedily submitted their land documents and token money to the accused
 lekin 4 saal baad bhi jab na to jameen adhigrahit hui or na hi is ilaake main vikaas kii koi yojana najar ai, tab thagi kii is vaardaat kaa khulaasa hua
 At the same time, many people had lost from 75 to 1 lakh rupees in the circle of getting jobs in government offices and coal mines
 aropiyon ne unhen bhi jald naukari dilaane kaa bharosa dilaayaa tha
 When the job was not done in two or three years, the victims asked for their money back
 aropiyon ke rakam dene se inkaar karne ke baad peediton ne police main shikaayat darj karai he
 At present, the news of Shankar Rajak and Siddhant Mahant's jail air is spreading like wildfire in the area
 donon kii giraftaar kii baat sunakar kai log thagi kii shikaayat lekar police ke paas pahunch rahe hai
 According to SDOP Korba Sandeep Mittal, this incident of cheating is in crores
 haalanki police sabhi shikayatakartaaon kii sunwaayee kar rahi he or unke mutabik puri vivechna ke baad hi dhokhadhadi kii adhikrut rakam kaa khulaasa hoga
 If you are a BJP worker or have a connection with its ideology, wait for the party's mouthpiece 'kamal Sandesh' every month, then you should stop doing so now
 yah paise kii tangahaali kii vajah se aam patr-patrikaon kii tarah band nahin hua he, balki apane andaaj or kaaryastylee kii vajah se ek alag pahchaan rakhane vaale bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne ise band karne kaa faisla kar liya he
 From the team selection to appointing the secretary of the parliamentary board, sharing the charge and converting the cells into the department, Shah had expressed this that he would do his will in the organization
 isi baangi ko aage badhaate hue unhone bijepi ke mukhpatr 'camel sandesh' ko band karne kaa faisla kiya jis par tatkaal prabhaav se amal ho gaya he
 In this mouthpiece, all the activities of BJP including organizational initiatives and stance on policy matters were served to explain to the workers
 bijepi ke maujuuda rashtriya upaadhyaksh prabhaat jha ne bataur sampadak is mukhpatr ko mukhar bana diya tha
 According to Amit Shah's arguments, the reason that Shah told party officials for shutting it down is that some leaders are not getting down but no one is able to point fingers at Shah's decision
 sutron ke mutabik, mukhpatr 'camel sandesh' ko band karne ko lekar shah kii daleel he ki isi tarah kii patrikabijepi kii har rajya ikaibhi chhapati he, isliye kendriya str par ise alag se chaape jane kaa koi auchity nahin he
 That is, the state units will continue to print their mouthpieces, but every state unit will have to print a centrally designed five-page compulsorily in the mouthpiece of the state BJP
 prabhaat jha ko hataaya gayis paanch panne ko taiyaar karne ke liye prabhaat jha ke saath kaam dekh rahe shivshakti ko rakhaa gaya he jabaki jha ko isdayitv se muktakar diya gaya he
 Now a four-member team has been formed, including Shivshakti and Sudha Malaiya, wife of Madhya Pradesh Finance Minister Jayant Malaiya, who will prepare five pages every month and send them to all the state units
 in paanch pannon main har maheene do mahapurushon kii jeevani ke vah ansh chaape jaaenge jo kaaryakartaaon ke liye prerak hon
 Among these great men, BJP has its ideal Pt
 dinadayal upaadhyaay or shyama prasad mukherjee samet anya mahapurushon kii jeevani bhi shaamil hogi
 Shah's effort is seen as an attempt to ideologically strengthen the Centre's hold on the state unit
 aatankwaadi devendrapal singhbhullar kii faansee kii sajaa barkaraarrakhane ke supreme court ke faisle par khushi jataate hue ol india anti tebrist front (eietief) ke chairman maninderjeet singh bitta bhavuk ho gaye or is dauraan unhone jamkar congressi netaaon ko kosa
 The Bitta Supreme Court was reacting to the decision that upheld the death sentence of terrorist Devendra Pal Singh Bhullar
 bhullar ko 1993 main dilli main dhamaakaa karne kaa doshi paaya gaya tha
 9 people were killed in the blast, while Congress leader MS Bitta was injured
 bitta ne kapil sibbal or ambika soni par nishaanaa saadhaa to congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko bhi nahin choda
 However, Bitta said the Gandhi family had no fault
 bitta ne supreme court ke faisle se khush the or bhavuk hokar rone bhi lage
 Bitta blamed the Congress leaders for the delay in getting Bhullar sentenced
 unhone kaha, 'main is faisle kaa sammaan karata hum or isse bahut khush hum
 My own people had abandoned me
 'bitta ne kapil sibbal par nishaanaa sadhate hue poocha, 'kapil sibbal ne bhullar kaa cese kyon ladaa tha?' bitta ne ambika soni par aarope lagaate hue kaha, 'ambika soni ne mujhe afjal guru kii faansee ke samay chup rahane ke liye kaha tha
 Bhullar also accused Sheila Dixit's government of saving Bhullar
 bitta ne kaha, 'sonia gandhi ne mujhe milane ke liye samay nahin diya tha
 'significantly, in 1993, in the same blast in Delhi, Bitta was injured
 bitta ne kaha, 'meri suraksha kyon hataai gai jabaki mujhe suraksha kii jarurat thi
 Bitta said, "now i want to see Rajiv Gandhi's killers as well
 ' isse pehle supreme court ne aatankwaadi devendrapal singh bhullar kii dayaa yachika ko thukraa diya
 Bhullar was convicted in the 1993 blast in Delhi
 is dhamaake main 9 logon kii maut ho gayi thi jabaki congress netaa emes bitta jakhmi ho gaye the
 In 2003, Bhullar filed a mercy petition with the President after he was hanged
 is faisle kaa asar kuch or maamalon par padegaa jisamen rajeev gandhi ke chaar hatyare bhi shaamil hai
 Lord Shiva is said to be the God of the Gods
 mahadev kaa ek rup tadenv karte nataraj kaa he to doosraa rup mahaan mahayogi kaa he
 Both these forms are full of mysteries, but Shiva is also known as Bholenath
 jahaan ek saath itane saare rang ho phir kyon na apni jindagi main in rangon se prerana len
 1
 buraai ko khatm karnaa:brahma utpatti ke liye or vishnu rachana ke liye or shiv ko vinaash ke liye janaa jaataa he
 This form of Shiva may seem intimidating to you but it is very important to eliminate any evil
 shiv isi ke liye jane jate hai
 2
 shant rahakar khud par niyantran rakhana:shiv se bada koi yogi nahin hua
 Keeping yourself away from a situation is not easy to hold on to
 mahadev ek baar dhyaan main baith jaaen to duniya idhar se udhar ho jaae lekin unka dhyaan koi bhang nahin kar saktaa he
 This meditation of Shiva teaches us to control things in life
 3
 Taking negative things also in a positive way: When the poison came out of the ocean, everyone pulled back because no one could drink the poison
 aise main mahadev ne swayan vish (halaahal) piya or unhen nilkanth naam diya gaya
 a big lesson is learned from this incident that we should also keep the negative things coming in life, but do not let the influence over us nor others
 4
 Respect for life partner: This form of Shiva is well known
 hindu manyataon ke hisaab se parfect partner mahadev ko hi mana jaataa he
 If Parvati meditated for years to convince him, on the other hand Shiva made him an Ardhangini
 tabhi to 33 karod devataaon main shiv ko hi ardhanarishwar kaha jaataa he
 5
 har samay samaan bhav rakhana:shiv kaa sampurna rup dekhakar yah sandesh miltaa he ki ham jin chizon ko apane aas-paas dekh bhi nahin sakate use unhone badi aasaani se apanaaya he
 That is when the circle of ghosts arrived on their marriage and a snake is wrapped around the neck of Bholenath, who is imposing in the body
 buraai kisi main nahin bas ek baar aapako use apnaanaa hota he
 6
 teesri aankh kaa khulanaa:shiv ko hameshaa trayambak kaha gaya he, kyonki unki ek teesri aankh he
 The third eye means that a second dimension of perception or experience has opened up
 do ankhen sirf bhautik chizon ko dekh sakati hai
 Which can look inward
 is bodh se aap jivan ko bilkul alag dhang se dekh sakate hai
 After this, all the things that can be experienced in the world can be experienced
 isliye bani banaai chizon par chalane se pehle khud samajhe-sochen
 7
 apni raah chunanaa:shiv kii jivan style ho yaa unka koi avatar
 They are completely different in every respect
 phir wo rup tandav karte hue nataraj ho, vish pine vaale nilkanth , ardhanarishwar, sabase pehle prasann hone vaale bholenath kaa ho
 They give the right path to life in every form
 pichley 2 dinon se dilli NCR main jagah-jagah par ho rahi barish kii vajah se dengue chikangunia kaa khatra or bad saktaa hai
 Because water is collecting from place to place in this rain and the current temperature of the capital is between 30 and 32
 aise taapmaana main machharon kii breeding kii zyada sambhaavna hoti he
 Now, if such water accumulates somewhere, mosquitoes can flourish very easily
 duusari taraf doctors kaa ye bhi maananaa he kibarishhogi tabhi mausam badalegaa or taapmaana main giravat aegi
 As soon as the temperature comes around 10 to 15 degrees and the same temperature will remain for 5 to 6 consecutive days, then the breeding of these mosquitoes will stop
 aise main barish hona bhi zaruri he
 According to the Meteorological Department, the monsoon is in its final stage, so we can assume that this rain is a knock of cold
 lekin ye barishbimariyonke lihaaz se bhi khatarnaak he
 Now in such a situation one just needs to be cautious
 doctors ke mutabik khatra abhi tala nahin he lekin apane aakhri charan par he
 At the moment, it is good to take precautions against mosquitoes
 phul sleeve kapado main rahanaa or ghar ke baahar pani ikaitha na hone den
 Agencies also need to continue fogging and supporting so that mosquitoes can be fought until the temperature drops
 bataur hero unhen yaad karne kii bhale hi koi bahut badi vajah hamaare paas na ho lekin wo asal jindagi main to hero hai hi
 His wife considers him the perfect husband

 lekin bipasha basu kii shaadi main donon jis tarah ek-duusare kaa khyaal rakhte najar aae, use dekhakar kisi ko bhi jalan ho sakati he

 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh hit out at Pakistan, saying that the security situation in South Asia would improve significantly if the neighboring country stopped supporting terrorists
 singh ne saath hi kaha ki khoonkhaar aatankwaadi sanghathan iesas bhartiya musalamaanon ko apni ore aakarshith karne main isliye asafal rahaa he, kyonki vah puri tarah se mukhyadhara main shaamil he
 He said, Indian Muslims are patriots and have not been seduced by any extremist ideology
 charampanth unki prakruti nahin he
 The Home Minister said that the biggest source of terrorist activities in India is across the border and it is unfortunate that even after paying such a huge price, Pakistan and its allies are finding it difficult to understand that there is nothing like 'good or bad terrorist' is
 rajnath ne yahaan aatankwaad rodhi antarrashtriya sammelan kaa udghaatan karne ke baad kaha, aatankwaadiyon ke bich achche yaa bure varg ke aadhaar par fark karne kaa vichaar buree tarah asafal rahaa he
 If the ISI and the Pakistani military stop supporting terrorist organizations, i have no hesitation in saying that South Asia's security situation will improve significantly
 grahamantri ne kaha ki pakistan ko chhadam yuddh ke madhyam ke taur par aatankwaad kaa istemaal karne kii apni ranneeti par gambhirtha se punarvichaar karnaa chahie or yah uske swayan ke rashtriya hit main hoga
 He said, India has been a victim of cross-border terrorism for the last several decades
 seemaa paar se lashkar-e-taiyaba or jaish-e-mohammad jaise aatankwaadi sanghathanon ko sangrakshan mila he
 These organizations have carried out many terrorist acts on Indian soil
 singh ne kaha ki aaj kii digital duniya main aatankwaad kaa khatra kaaphi bad gaya he or ab vishwa ke ek kone kii ghatana se hajaaron mile dur bhi tatkaal pratikriya ho sakati he or jahaan koi ek ‘khurafati dimag’ online jaakar yah jaan saktaa he ki ghar se baahar nikle bina hamalaa kaise kiya jaataa he
 Referring to ISIS, he said that the influence of the Islamic State on Indian youth is negligible
 rajnath singh ne kaha, hamaari khufia agenciyon ke anusaar keval mutthibhar bhartiya yuvak iesas main shaamil hue hai or kuch apane parivaar dwaara samajhane ke baad ghar laut aae hai
 He said that India is proud of its diversity as a country and has the second largest Muslim population in the world after Indonesia
 kendriya jal sansaadhan, nadi vikaas or ganga sangrakshan mantri uma bharti ne shuukravaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tarifon ke pul baandhte hue kaha, 'vah saadhaaran vyakti nahin balki bharat main ek hajaar saal baad paidaa hue ek maseehaa hai, jisaki bharat ko jarurat thi

 ?" After the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, a new round of accusations has started in the Rajasthan Congress
 isse pehle congress kaarysmiti main party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne saaf taur par kaha tha ki congress ke netaa apane beton kaa hi chunaav prachaar karne main lage rahe
 But now Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has said that party state president Sachin Pilot should take responsibility for the defeat of his son Vaibhav Gehlot
 gauratlab he ki disambar ke maheene main sarkaar banane vaali congress loksabhaa chunaav main rajya main ek bhi seat nahin jeet pai he
 In an interview to ABP News, Ashok Gehlot said, 'sachin Pilot had said that we will win by a large majority
 unhone kaha ki jodhpur loksabhaa seat main hamaare 6 vidhayak jite hai
 We have done good publicity there
 
 
 ab sachin payalat ko kam se kam jodhpur main hui haar kii jimmedaari leni chahie'
 Significantly, Ashok Gehlot's son Vaibhav 2 from Jodhpur seat
 7 lakh voton se haare hai
 He is defeated by bjp's Gajendra Singh Shekhawat
 apane bete ko jitaane ke liye ashok gahalot yahaan par jamkar prachaar kiya tha
 His opponents say that out of this seat, Ashok Gehlot did not go anywhere else to campaign and did most of the rallies in this seat
 haalanki baad main apana bayaan badalte hue ashok gahalot yah bhi kaha ki yah sabaki jimmedaari he, chaahe vah pradesh congress adhyaksh hon yaa phir mukhyamantri
 Necklaces on such a large scale are beyond comprehension

 chah agast kii subah, jab punjab police ke adhikari darwaja todakar chandigarh ke paas mohali main anuraadhaa bali urf phija mohammad ke ghar main ghuse to vahaan unki laash mili
 Fiza had died several days earlier
 usee din se kayaas lagaae jane lage the ki yah saamaanya maut na hokar iske peeche koi kahani he
 Now these doubts appear to be stronger
 phija kii maut ko ek maheene se zyada samay guzar jane ke baad is maamle main ek nayaa mode aa gaya he
 a team of three forensic experts from Punjab government laboratories in Kharar has reported aluminum phosphide in Fiza's intestine - a dangerous toxic pesticide used in agriculture
 in visheshgyon ko maut kaa kaaran jaanane ke liye phija kii aant kii jaanch kaa kaam saunpa gaya tha
 As expected, the gut report has once again fueled speculation that the Chandigarh-based human rights activist and senior advocate of the Punjab and Haryana High Court Ranjan Lakhanpal is demanding that the case be considered 'murder' To be done
 ranjan ne patrakaron se baatcheet main kaha, ‘‘phija kaa aakasmik nidhan vastav main ‘haai profile logon ke haathon anjaam di gai ek suniyojit hatya’ he
 "the needle of these things directly revolves around Fiza's old and failed relationship with the former Deputy Chief Minister of Haryana
" 41 varshiya phija surkhiyon main tab ai thim, jab disambar, 2008 main unhone haryana ke tatkaaleen up-mukhyamantri chandramohan ke saath gup-chup dhang se byaah rachaa liya tha
 The end of Fiza's life was as dramatic and isolated as her personal life
 chandramohan haryana ke purv mukhyamantri or haryana janhit congress ke sangrakshak rahe divangat bhajanlaal ke bade bete hai
 On August 7, only 20 close relatives and friends attended Fiza's funeral in Chandigarh
 udhar, media main atakalon kaa nayaa daur shuru ho gaya tha
 Was it a drug overdose by mistake? Did anyone assassinate him? Did his loneliness force him to commit suicide? Was it her inability to live a notorious life? Lakhanpal, who is considering filing a petition in the High Court, points out that Fiza often feared a threat to her life from her ex-husband's family
 phija se shaadi karne ke liye islam kabool karke apana naam chand mohammad karne vaale chandramohan ne is vivaadaaspad nikaah ke turant baad hi use chhod diya tha
 He then returned to his wife and family
 televijan networkon or akhabaaron ke is jode ke naatakeey dhang se bhaagane or shaadi karne kii khabaron ke prasaaran ke mushkil se 20 din baad hi chandramohan ne telephone par teen baar ‘talaak’ shabd kahkar phija se peechha chhudaa liya tha
 Fiza, the eldest of four sisters, was born Anuradha Bali and was the daughter of MES (military Engineering Services) officer Dharam Paul and Savitri Devi
 ambala ke rahane vaale ye donon sirf is kaaran chandigarh aae the, taaki apane bacchon ko behatar shiksha dilaa saken
 Fiza had attended Central School before being admitted to the Law School on the Chandigarh campus of Punjab University
 unhone punjab evam haryana hycourt main vakaalat shuru kar di thi or iske baad jald hi 2005 main ve pehle punjab sarkaar main or phir haryana sarkaar main assistant edwocket general niyukt kii gai thim
 Opponents often credited his 'suspicious' closeness with senior lawyers and leaders including Chandramohan for moving so fast
 maamle kii jaanch karne vaale police adhikari abhi tak phija kii maut ko kisi tareeke kii gadabadi se jodgaye ke liye raji nahin hai
 Mohali's Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Gurpreet Singh Bhullar says, "it is more likely that he committed suicide
 ’’ aant main aluminium phosphid kii jaanch karne vaali doctoron kii team bhi maanati he ki chunki yah jehar apni khaas gandh ke kaaran turant pahchaan main aa jaataa he, isliye kisi ke liye zyada se zyada gandh vaale khaadya yaa peya padaarth ke saath milakar bhi yah jehar chupake se yaa jabardastee phija ko khilaa dena lagbhag asambhav he
 Bhullar, however, says he is in no hurry to close the case file and has instructed the Special Investigation Team (SIT) to wait for all possible evidence before reaching any final conclusion
 bhullar ne india today ko bataaya ki unke log ab sambhavit suraagon ke liye phija ke bank lowers kholane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 The investigation team also opened three bank lockers of Fiza on Thursday, including a total of 1
 05 karod ru
 Cash, gold and diamond jewelry have been found
 isse pehle bhi phija ke ghar kii talaashi main, 92
 5 lakhs
 nakad or dedh kilo se zyada ke sone ke gahane mili the
 Professor of History in Punjab University M
 rajeev lochan yaad karte hai, ‘‘1990 ke dashak kii baat he
 She used to be a completely confident girl
 ‘apane man kii baat kehane se kabhi nahin darati thi’, us daur main bhi nahin jab chaatr samudaay kaa ek bada varg hinsa or aatankwaad se prabhavit najar aata tha
 "sociologist Santosh Singh at Ambedkar University in Delhi sees 'death of ambition' in Fiza's death
 is baat par afsos jataate hue ki unki mahatvakanksha ko hi ab unke patan or unki maut kii vajah tehraaya ja rahaa he, ve kehete hai, ‘‘vah lokapriyata, paisa or takat chaahati thi
 In fact, it contained all the values that our society today considers great
 lekin vah ek aurat thi or kisi taqatvar rajnatik parivaar se tallukaat bhi nahin rakhti thim
 Fiza, who remained somewhat isolated in the last days, stayed away from neighbors whom he believed would judge him based on unconventional methods
 phija ne apni do choti bahanon monica or aditi tathaa apane chachaa satpal sahit parivaar ke sadasyon se bhi naata tod liya tha
 Fija is said to have refused him when his uncle asked him to come to stay on the first floor of his Sector-48 house to help him cope with the neighbors who had troubled him
 rajeev lochan maanate hai ki chandramohan ke saath uske rishte khatm hone ke baad agar phija ko vyapak saamaajik samarthan mila hota, to phija kaa jivan is tarah achaanak khatm nahin hua hota
 Especially with the neighbors and the media, which presented their marriage and relationship after a few days in such a juicy way
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘kai dinon tak uske shav kaa andekha akelaa pade rahanaa bhartiya aadhuniktaa ke liye ek mile ke pathar jaisaa he, phir bhi ham phija jaisi aakraamak tewaron vaali mahilaon se us tareeke se pesh aate hai, jo aadim yug kii yaad taaja kar detaa he
 "on Fiza's death, the police is expected to be officially cleared in the coming weeks
" beshak baaten kuch bhi kahi jaaen, philhal yah gutthi sulajh nahin paaegi ki phija kii hatya hui yaa usne aatmahatya kii
 How did a young woman - strong, unassuming, and beautifully dressed - finally have such a sad ending? pakistan ke dakshini wajiristaan ilaake main guuruuvaar tadake hue america drone hamale main chaar logon kii maut ho gai

 Senior BJP leader and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi on Friday demanded the Election Commission to take action against the jailed RJD chief Lalu Prasad for being politically active through Twitter

 Regarding Anna's condition of incorporating Lokshahi from top to bottom in the Jan Lokpal Bill, the Chief Minister made it clear that only top officials should be included in the Lokpal's purview because when higher level officials will be honest and control them If it remains, then the lower level officials will automatically become honest

 mayawati ne kaha ki bhrashtachar jaise mahatvapurn mudde par raajnneetik kheenchaatani uchit nahin he
 Last night at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan, the Delhi government should seriously take up the matter of the scandal by some chaotic elements and strictly deal with such elements, otherwise such elements in the country can spoil law and order

 Till now it was very difficult for Muslim women to go on Haj, as they had to live with a man from their family (mehram) all the time, but this year after mutual discussion between India and Saudi Arabia, now Indian Muslim women are without men Can also go on Haj with muslim mahilaon ko mili is adhikaar ke baad uttar pradesh main is saal akele haj par jane ke liye 100 mahilaon ne aavedan kiya he or inamen sabase adhik sankhya agra mandal kii he
 Sources claim that the number of women applying for Haj this year may increase by five times as compared to last year
 upi haj cameti ke purv sadsy esayu kuraishi ne kaha ki pichley saal haj ke liye badale gaye niyamon main 45 varsh se adhik umr kii mahilaon or jinke saath kanoonee meharam nahin tha, unhen haj ke liye chote samoohon main saudi arab jane kii anumati di gai thi
 The National Haj Committee sent 20 women in groups of 4 to 4 on Hajj that year
 bhartiya muslim vikaas parishad ke adhyaksh sami aghai ne kaha ki modi sarkaar muslim mahilaon kii hitaishi banane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The Modi government is trying to take credit for the decision to go to Mehram without Haj
 unhone kaha ki sharia kanoon ke anusaar, ek mahila ke liye haj tab tak purna nahin kaha ja saktaa jab tak ki vah meharam ke saath na ho
 Perhaps this is why the government is sending women in groups of four
 haalanki bahut sari mahilaon ne is varsh meharam ke saath yatra karne ke liye aavedan kiya he, lekin meharam ke bina yatra karne vaali mahilaon kii sankhya bhi adhik he
 Such women are praising this move of Modi government
 mufti mudassar ali khan kadri ne kaha ki haalanki haj ek kartavya he jise puraa kiya ja saktaa he, bhale hi mahila bina meharam ke haj kare, lekin modi sarkaar ko islamic kanoon main bahut zyada dakhal dene se bachanaa chahie
 If the government wants to look progressive and do some welfare of Muslims, it should discuss every Muslim-centric laws with a group of Muslim ulema

 unhone kaha ki mid de mile kii vajah se skulon main pramukh kaam bhojan bananaa or khilaanaa hi rah gaya he, jiskaa sidhaa asar bacchon kii padhai-likhaai par pad rahaa he
 Counting the shortcomings of the mid-day meal scheme, Nitish Kumar said that due to lack of infrastructure in schools, unskilled chefs and unhygienic ration storage and management, there is a problem in providing quality mid-day meals
 unhone kaha ki kharaab gunvattta kaa bhojan karne se aksar bachche aswasth ho jate hai or abhibhavakon ke aakrosh ke kaaran kanoon vyavastha bigadane ke halaat paidaa ho jate hai
 This is not compatible with the educational environment of schools
 aisi yojanaon ke liye badi sankhya main anganbari sevikaon or rasoiyon kii niyukti kerani padati he, jo samay-samay par apni maangon ko lekar dabaav daalate hai
 Simultaneously protests
 isaki vajah se yojanaon ko lagu karne main khaasi dikkat hoti he
 During this, Nitish Kumar suggested that the Bihar government has been providing funds directly to the beneficiaries under the dress scheme and girl cycle scheme for girls for the last several years
 ye yojanaayen kaaphi safal rahi hai
 Similarly, funds can also be made available directly to the beneficiaries for nutrition
 unhone kaha ki bhojan kii nimna gunvattta, labhaarthiyon ke bich asantosh or bhrashtachar kii niyamit shikayaton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue in yojanaon main pratyaksh laabh antarang kii ranneeti apanaakar lakshith samooh ko raashi uplabdh karai jaani chahie
 The CM of Bihar said that it should be believed that the beneficiaries will use the funds given for nutrition for the same work for which it is provided
 aisa karne se anganbari kendra or skulon ke karmi apane muldayitvon kaa nirvahan kar sakenge
 Also, the functioning of these institutions will improve
