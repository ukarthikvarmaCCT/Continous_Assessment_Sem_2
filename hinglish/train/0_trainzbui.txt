 What was the role of Pawan Bansal in the rail bribery? Currently, the CBI does not have the answer to this question
 jaanch agency yah daawa to kar rahi he ki tay samay ke bheetar yani 3 july tak ghuscand main chargeshit daakhil kar di jaaegi
 But according to the country's largest investigative agency, there is no direct evidence yet of the direct role of the former railway minister
 udhar, sibiai ne aropiyon kii baatcheet ke jo colls record kiye hai usase pawan bansal lagaataar jaanch ke ghere main funsate ja rahe hai
 Bansal's nephew Vijay Singla's conversation tape with Mahesh Kumar has recorded many serious things
 kai baar baatcheet ke dauraan vijay singla mahesh kumaar se rishwat ko lekar saudebaaji kar rahaa he
 According to the information, Vijay Singla clearly told Mahesh Kumar that below the amount of 10 crores, the Railway Minister would get angry
 sutron ke mutabik sibiai ke paas aropiyon kii jo kol records hai usamen se aadha darjan main baatcheet ke dauraan rishwat ko lekar lagaataar saudebaaji ho rahi he
 Mahesh Kumar and Manjunath are insisting that the bribe should be reduced, but Singla is not willing to reduce even one rupee
 singla apni baatcheet main mahesh kumaar ko bharosa dilaane ke liye meetings main shaamil hone vaale adhikariyon ke naam tak bataa rahaa he
 Now the question is being raised again and again in front of the CBI, whether Vijay Singla is taking the name of Pawan Bansal just to emphasize his point or that he had already spoken to Bansal? The CBI is collating the call records with the files and trying to determine how much Bansal knows about the case
 haalanki sibiai saboot jutaney ke daawey bhi kar rahi he or kah rahi he ki paryaapt saboot hone par pawan bansal se poochtacha hogi

 He said there may be ideological differences between BJP and SP but it is a matter of privilege of the House

 chini sainikon ne aisa sambhavat: ilaake par apana daawa karne ke liye kiya
 The military headquarters tried to downplay the incident, saying the matter had been resolved in a 'amicable' manner, but sources said the Chinese side only agreed when local Indian military officials called for a flag meeting on the matter
 And warned that the issue would be raised to a higher level
 aisi jaankaree mili he ki donon deshon ke sthaneey sainya adhikariyon ne is mudde par sampark sthapit kiya
 The incident has taken place after the Border Defense Cooperation Agreement, after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh signed the Border Defense Cooperation Agreement with China in October to prevent an incident of confrontation on the Line of Actual Control between the armies of the two countries

 nyamurti patil ne kaha ki unhone aavanton prakriya main kuch khamiyaan pai hai or unhone apni rapat main iskaa ullekh kiya he, par unhone samvaadadaataaon ko swayan iskaa vivaran dene se manaa kiya
 Patil, in a brief conversation with reporters after handing over the report to Telecom and Information Technology Minister Kapil Sibal at his office, said, "some flaws have been found in the allocation process
 maine apni rapat main uskaa ullekh kiya he
 'patil refused to give any details of this report

 But they refused to give their names or numbers
 unhone kaha ki jab yah rapat saarvajanik kii jaaegi to us samay saare tathy saamne aa jaaenge
 In response to a question, Justice Patil said that there was no 'external pressure' on him (regarding the investigation) other than his conscience
 sibbal ne bhi rapat praapt karne ke baad kaha, ‘kuch adhikariyon kaa naam liya gaya he or kuch prakriyaaon par tippanee kii gayi he

 If sources are to be believed, the government can call a special session of Parliament from 31 August to 4 September

 This session will be the normal session of Parliament, so it will be necessary to give mps at least 15 days time to ask questions

 uttar pradesh main agadi jatiyaan (savarna) bhi bijepi ke saath khadi dikhaai deen kyonki inamen se 61 fisadi ne apni pehali pasand camel ko bataaya tha
 The benefit of akhilesh-shivpal infighting is bjp's fact that this survey was conducted at a time when the discord within the Samajwadi Party was not openly exposed, nor was it expected that the SP would be torn apart in this way over ticket distribution
 
 lekin november main jab ye baat saamne ai ki akhilesh yadav alag party banaakar chunaav ladane kii soch rahe hai tab hue ek twarit survey main jab logon se ye poocha gaya ki sapa ke is andruni dangal kaa phayda kise hoga to 39% logon ne kaha ki isse bijepi ko phayda hoga jabaki isse thik 10 fisadi kam yani 29% logon ne iskaa phayda bispi ko milane kii baat kahi
 It is clear that any possible split in the SP is going to harm the SP and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, whereas the BJP can remain in the advantage
 bijepi kii badhat main bhi he ek bada penchaupi main voter bijepi ko pasand to kar rahe hai lekin bina netritv ke chunaav ladane kaa khamiyaja use yahaan bhi bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Mayawati was her first choice as Chief Minister in the India Today survey, in which voters described BJP as her first choice
 maaya ko is maamle main 31 fisadi vot mili jabaki akhilesh yadav duusare number par rahe
 He was liked by 27 per cent people as CM
 desh ke grih mantri or upi ke purv siem rajnath singh ko 18 fisadi voter upi kaa mukhyamantri banate dekhnaa chaahate the
 BJP clearly needs a charismatic face in UP
 haal hi main hue kuch vidhansabha chunaavon ko dekhen to janata ne us party par zyada bharosa jataayaa he jiskaa siem candidate pehle se ghoshit he
 The major reason for bjp's decline from 28 to just three seats in two elections held within a few months in Delhi was also told that BJP contested the first election under the leadership of Dr
 Harsh Vardhan, while in the second election it won the last minute Kiran Bedi
 Made parachute candidates
 darasal sapa ke paramparaagat voter yadav or muslim maane jate hai
 If SP is torn apart, then Muslim votes can be split and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party can get it, while Yadav, disappointed with SP, can trust BJP in assembly elections like Lok Sabha elections
 agar aisa hua to dalit or muslim gathjod kii seedhiyaan mayawati ko 2007 kii tarah satta dilaa sakati he or bijepi haath malati rah sakati he

 dilli kii vidhansabha main 14 farvari ko apane bhaashan main kejariwal ne sansad main hui hinsa or vidhansabha main mike ukhaadie jaisi ghatnaon kii bhatrsana kii
 Kejriwal knows that the people of the country are angry with this conduct of the leaders
 ve isi janabhaavana kii sawari karnaa chaahate hai
 Despite not having a majority in Delhi, the AAP excitedly formed the government, but the burden of the expectations of the people and the complication of the system in the system also led to tremendous criticism
 kejariwal sarkaar ke mantri pehle din se vivaadon main ghirne lage
 For this reason, Kejriwal himself had announced not to contest the Lok Sabha elections, but a section of the party wanted that without Kejriwal going to the Lok Sabha elections would not be able to achieve that much success
 aap kii ranneeti thi ki congress ko is kadar majaboor kar diya jaae ki vah khud samarthan waapas le le jabaki congress aisa karne se parhez kar rahi thi or vidhansabha main congress ne dohari ranneeti apanaakar aap ko gherne kii bhi koshish kii
 By the way, AAP also used time to strengthen its position
 aap kaa dilli main kareeb dedh maheene kaa project us padhe-likhe, ucch madhyavarg se aage jane kii naatakeey chalaang jaisaa he, jiske samarthan se yah party satta main pahunchi
 It has now set its eyes on a very ambitious class which has come above the poverty line and aspires to shape its future
 neshnal council for aplide iconomic research (ensieiaar) ke 2010 ke survey main madhyavarg se neeche ek varg kii ore ishaara kiya gaya
 This class aspires to grow further and has an annual income of Rs 90,000
 se do lakh ru
 Is between survey se yah pataa chalaa ki is varg kaa dayera pichley dashak main badhkar kul aabaadi kaa kareeb ek-tihaai ho gaya he
 In an interview posted on the pre-election AAP website, party strategist Yogendra Yadav said, "there is evidence that our strength is more in the middle but this middle is not what is meant by the middle class because the middle class here means ruling Is taken from the square
 ” aap ko lagata he ki uskaa kaa janaadhar samaaj ke upree 10 fisadi (aamadani ke paimaane par) or nichle 20 fisadi vaale tabake main kamjor he jabaki bich ke 70 fisadi tabake main majboot he
 When the party expressed its intention to contest elections in 350 Lok Sabha seats across the country, it received around 9,000 applications from potential candidates in the last one and a half months
 party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini ke sadsy anand kumaar kehete hai, “isane logon kii ummiido ko par laga die hai
 "at his Jawaharlal Nehru University residence, a retired army officer came to meet him with his application for a Lok Sabha seat
 ve kehete hai, “ek din ek dalit vakil ham logon se mili or kehane lage ki ve samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ke khilaaf chunaav laduya chaahate hai
 These people do not belong to the middle class
 dilli main jo shuruyaat hui, uskaa ehsaas deshbhar main hone laga he
 "the India today-sea voter survey conducted in January this year shows that 38 per cent of the people want to see Kejriwal as the Prime Minister, which is second only to Narendra Modi of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 lekin aap nae mahatvakankshi varg ko dhyaan main rakhkar deshbhar main ummid kii lahar paidaa karnaa chaahegi or isi vishesh yojana ke tahat dilli main party kii sabhi chaalen chali ja rahi hai
 However, the viewer from outside does not understand this strategy as much as party actors understand it from within
 bhrashtachar virdohi muhimajanlokapal or naagarik inspectoranalokapal vidheyak bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii samaysima ke bheetar jaanch-padtaal or mukademe kii baat karata he
 Kejriwal had already threatened that he would resign if this bill is not passed
 chunki dilli centreshasit rajya he isliye har vidheyak ko paas karne ke liye centre sarkaar kii manjuuri kii kii jarurat hoti he lekin kejariwal ne vidheyak ko ‘nirikshan’ ke liye centre sarkaar ke paas bhejne se saaf-saaf inkaar kar diya
 The Lieutenant Governor of Delhi did not allow it to present the House
 janvari ke ant se kejariwal radio par dilli ke logon se kah rahe the ki ve sarkari adhikariyon ko ghoose dene se inkaar na karen, balki unhen ghoose lete yaa uski baat karte apane mobile phone main record kar len or use party kii bhrashtachar virdohi helpline par bhej den
 Kejriwal's voice echoed on the radio, "now every citizen will become like a police inspector
 ” phir, 11 farvari ko unhone prakritik gas kii keemat gaiyr-kanoonee taur par badhaane ke liye kendriya petroleum mantri virappa moili or reliance industries ke chairman mukesh ambani ke khilaaf exiar darj karne kaa aadesh diya
 The anti-corruption campaign is aap's oldest and most favorable electoral slogan, so it feels that it will get huge benefits in the new ambitious section, which is tired of overheating the fists of the officials
 india today-si voter ke janamat surveykshan main madhyavarg ke 40 fisadi log bhrashtachar ko aaj desh kii sabase badi samasya maanate hai
 Kejriwal's campaign became an instant hit
 dilli sarkaar kii yah helpline dukandaaron or rehadi-patari waalon ke bich sabase zyada lokapriy hui jo dilli police ke sipaahiyon se sabase zyada pareshaan rahete hai
 The FIR against Ambani also proved to be a masterstroke
 ek party netaa kehete hai, “kai logon kii dharna he ki audyogic gharaane desh ko lut rahe hai or kejariwal unase loha lene vaale pehle vyakti hai
 The agitating Chief Minister, sitting on the road politics, looking at Parliament, Delhi Law Minister Somnath Bharti, along with his supporters, raided a house at midnight on January 18 in the window extension against the alleged drug and prostitution racket
 vahaan dilli police ne bina warrant ke red maarane se inkaar kar diya to kanoon mantri ke saath bahasabaaji ho gai
 Shortly thereafter, Kejriwal announced that the Delhi Police should be brought under the Delhi government instead of the Center or else they would hold a 10-day sit-in
 apni puri cabinet ke saath mukhyamantri ke dharne par baithne se central dilli main janajivan ast-vyast ho gaya
 However, a day and a half later, an agreement was reached with the Home Ministry and the picket was broken
 bharti ke saath tark-vitark karne vaale do pulisavaalon ko chuttee par bhej diya gaya
 Party insiders believe that this only step was probably taken in haste and due to circumstances
 dharne par baithne ke liye kejariwal ko media, ucch madhyavarg ke ek varg or captain ji
 R
 gopinath jaise party sadasyon kii naaraazgi jhelni padi
 Despite this, Kejriwal managed to give the message that he would not follow the government-bound rules and would continue to hit the road if necessary
 10 farvari ko ek tivi intervyuu main unhone dharne ko kuch logon ke liye “saanskrithik jhatka” qaraar diya
 He reiterated his resolve to break through the status quo and go beyond established institutions and norms which did not please the educated elite, but filled the new middle class with great enthusiasm
 ek party sadsy bataate hai, “zyaadaatar log sansthaaon ko chunauti dene ko bura nahin maanate kyonki unke ve shikaar hote rahe hai
 Only relatively rich people talk about the dignity of institutions because they fear that their disintegration will cause them losses
 ”aam aadmi kii sattakrantikari upaydharna ke aalochakon ke prati kejariwal ne kaha ki raat kaa taapmaana 4 degree ho to sadak par sona koi hansi-majaak nahin he
 The picture of sleeping on the street at night inspires many

 The bill talks about decentralization of power at the hands of 2,720 Mohalla sabhas across the city
 ye mohalla sabhaayen sadakon kii safai, saarvajanik tikaakaran, sabko shiksha or dharoharon kii rakhwvaali kaa kaam karengi
 The Bill empowers every House to make all kinds of expenditure for public welfare in its territory
 mohalla sabhaaon ke jariye prashasan chalaane kaa vichaar kejariwal kii nai raajnneeti kaa moolmantra he
 Says a member of aap's National Executive, "instead of dividing the society into various blocks of tribal, scheduled caste and so on, Mohalla Sabha will be a means of uniting people
 ” congress kii daleel he ki shahar main residents welfare association mohalla sabha kaa hi kaam kar rahe hai, aap kaa tark he ki inkaa dayera simit he or mote taur ucch madhyavarg ke kabje main rahete hai
 The Mohalla Sabha will get representation from the marginalized sections in every locality
 aap kii sarkaar ne rashtriya str par abhiyaan ke liye paryaapt mudde pradaan kar die hai or ab party ise or majboot karne main jute gai he
 According to Anand Kumar, the next few weeks will be important when the party releases the final list of candidates and the national manifesto
 ve kehete hai, “suchi se pataa chalegaa ki party achche ummidavaaron ke liye vaaki khuli hui he
 Many committees were made to prepare the national plan, many have been added together
 ” masalan arthvyavastha or paryaavaran ke maamle main party kai visheshgyon se raay-mashvira kar rahi he
 At the moment, there are similar indications that the party has cleverly wooed its favorite electorate
 yah dilachasp he ki congress or bijepi, donon ne janalokapal bill ko laane ke ‘tareeke’ kaa virodh kiya
 But AAP leaders are telling people that the two parties have united on the issue of corruption
 vaade puure karne se behatar istifabhrashtachar virodh kii aawaaj banane kii koshishlekin sabase bada sawaal yah he ki dilli vidhansabha chunaav se pehle logon kaa vishwaas hasil karne ke liye kejariwal ko kareeb chah maheene mil gaye the
 During this time, he was engaged in the work of connecting with the public like a dervish away from the media
 vahiin duusari taraf sarkaar banane ke baad se kejariwal ne ek ke baad ek muddon ko khol diya
 He made Delhi an operation theater where the old merge was dismantled, but the stitches were not installed
 sab bikharaa padaa tha
 Kejriwal and his party rode hope in the Delhi Assembly elections
 bijli-pani kii dar kam karne se lekar 500 skool kholane or fatafat court ke faisle karaane, aarakshan kaa backlog bharne, safai karmchaariyon samet tamaam theka karmchaariyon ko permanent karne jaise vaade kiye gaye the
 These promises were overshadowing the government and contract workers were protesting in the city
 sarkaar ne aanshik rup se kuch vaadon ko puraa karne kii koshish bhi kii
 Due to this, the graph of the party's popularity in Delhi was decreasing
 party netaaon ko lagata he ki aabaadi kaa bada tabaka ise gandi raajnneeti ke khilaaf kejariwal kii jang ke taur par dekh rahaa he
 By the way, he realized that if the government keeps running then it may have to face anti-incumbency or anti-government sentiments
 lihaaja, vaade nibhaane se kai behatar, sasta or zyada vot batorne vaala kadam he siyaasi shahadat
 If the voters too saw it from Kejriwal's perspective, then the problems of BJP and Congress can increase
 —saath main santosh kumaar In the battle of uncle and nephew in the Samajwadi Party, the matter has now reached the party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav

 Amar Singh, refraining from reacting to the skirmishes between Akhileshpal and Akhilesh, said, "I am a Mulayamist, not a socialist
" iske alaava philhal kuch nahin kahuunga
 On the reshuffle in the party and the government, Shivpal said nothing about his recent promotion in the party, which Shivpal said that he was angry with the government of 8 departments including Public Works, Revenue and Irrigation, being kept silent
 iske alaava apane kareebi do mantriyon or ek bade naukarshah ko hataane par bhi vah kuch bhi kehane se bache

 " The Supreme Court has dismissed the plea of the central government seeking the execution of Murgan, Santhan, Perarivalan, convicted in the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi murder case
 centre ne curative petishan daakhil kar faansee kii sajaa ko umr kaid main badalane ke khilaaf yachika daakhil kii thi
 The verdict was for the release of 7 convicts, before the Supreme Court reduced the death sentence to three of them
 supreme court se rajeev gandhi ketin hatyaron kii faansee umrakaidamen tabdeel hone ke baad tamilnadu sarkaar ne rajeev gandhi ke sabhi saaton hatyaron santhan, shriharan urf murugun, perarivalan, nalini, rarbat paayas, ravichandran or jayakumar ko reeha karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The Supreme Court had changed the sentence to life imprisonment
 The Supreme Court on 18 February 2014 had commuted the life sentence of the three convicts, Murugan and Perarivalan, who were sentenced to death in the Rajiv Gandhi murder case
 teenon ne dayaa yachikaaon ke nibatare main deree ke aadhaar par maut kii sajaa ko umr kaid main tabdeel karne kaa anurodh kiya tha
 The Supreme Court granted this relief, rejecting all the arguments of the central government opposing it

 On the other hand, the crisis in front of the BJP government is that who should handle the government
 parrikar kii tarah tajurbe vaala koi netaa dur-dur tak nahin dikhataa or vahaan sarkari kaamkaaj ekatarah se susti vaali mod main chalaa gaya he
 The Congress wants to take full advantage of Parrikar's ill health and the 'vacuum' under the BJP leadership, when he has hurriedly met the Governor and demanded a floor test
 is babat ek gyaapan bhi saunpa gaya he
 On the other hand there is BJP which is well aware that if the Chief Minister is changed, there will be a floor test in the Vidhan Sabha and the party can get trapped in the political vortex
 isliye party kaa puraa dhyaan is baat par he ki koedipti siembanakar sankat taala jaae, jisase congress kii ranneeti bhi fail ho

 In the name of Sudin Dhavalikar, Sudan Dhavalikar is also coming up for the post of Deputy CM in some factions of Bwalmedia, but in the name of him, there has been a ruckus in the past, so the possibility of handing over the post to him is quite low
 dhawalikar kaa maamla isliye funs rahaa he kyonki ve maharashtra gomantak party (emjeepi) ke varisht netaa to hai lekin unki partibijepimen vilay hona nahin chaahati
 While the demand has intensified that the three MGP mlas in the Parrikar government will now formally join the BJP to increase the bjp's strength from 14 to 17
 isse floor test main kamyaabi hasil karne main bijepi ko madad milegi
 Rejecting the merger of MGP with BJP, the MGP president said, "we cannot merge as our party is the fruit of years of hard work and also the hope of Goa politics in future
" goa main 12-13 pratishat vot bank he, isliye bijepi ke saath milane kaa koi sawaal nahin
 It is clear from Dhavalikar that he will not meet in BJP
 or yah bhi saaf he ki bijepi bina milaae unhen koi bada pad nahin de sakati, isliye dhawalikar ke naam par philhar brake lagata dikh rahaa he
 The name of Pramod Sawant, who is the speaker of the assembly, is also coming forward for the post of Chief Minister

 She spends her entire life naming children

 But what do you do for mother? Mother's Day is celebrated for forgetting mother's love and sacrifice
 yah din maa ko pyaar jataane or khush rakhane kaa hota he
 365 days of the year are loved by the mother, but the matter of Mother's Day is different

 Yesterday saw herself in mother's eyes ye aainaa hamen boodha nahin bataata he Former Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde has said that the Congress party has supported demonetisation from the beginning, but the Modi government did not even think about what will happen tomorrow after the demonetization decision
 logo ko kitni takalif ho rahi he
 The decision may be well taken, which will help in curbing black money
 lekin purv niyojan or taiyaari se notebandi ko amal main laayaa hota to logon ko itani pareshaani kaa saamana nahin karnaa padataa
 Shinde said that sixty to seventy people across the country lost their lives in queues due to this demonetisation
 aaj har ek vyakti pareshaan he
 Traders are upset, farmers are upset
 marij pareshaan hai kyonki samay par ilaaj nahin ho rahaa he

 tab scindia ne hanskar jawaab diya ki kis-kis ko ye sarkaar deshadrohi qaraar detii he ye samaj nahin aa rahaa he
 Let's accept what you did right, but the note ban would have been planned properly
 agar uri ilaake main hamalaa hua or kisi ne uske bare main tipanni kii to turant use deshadrohi kahana thik nahin
 The state is administered in such a way
 log ab bahut samajhadaar ho gaye hai
 Shinde said that the opposition is facing allegations that Parliament does not run

 in / 1 july se jiesti lagu hote hi online shopping mahangi ho sakati he
 There is a reason behind this
 jiesti lagu hote hi i-commers companiyon ko apane saplyrs ko bhugtan karte vakt 1% tisies (tex collection ait sorce) vasuulne kii jarurat hogi
 In view of this, many e-commerce companies including Filipkart, Amazon are offering great discounts on online shopping with many offers
 kai saamaanon kii keemat par to 80% tak kii chhot he
 Right now these companies are not required to pay TCS, but as soon as GST is implemented, they will have to pay this tax and the burden will be on the consumers
 is kaaran ye companiyaan apana zyada se zyada stock khatm karnaa chaahati hai
 The comments i kamrs ke jaankaar dow
 Amit Moheshwari states that 'till now there was no tax on e-commerce merchants
 ab 1% tex lagegaa or ye bhaar upabhokta tak pahonchega'
 The GST network portal has started accepting e-commerce operators from June 25
 baari bheed ko dekhte hue sabhi registration ke jiesti lagu hone kii taarikh yani 1 july se pehle hone kii sambhaavna nahin ke baraabar he
 With this, the government has exempted them from paying tax for some time, that is, it will be economical to shop online for some more time
 haalanki is faisale ke baad baaki vyapaaree bhi tex se chhot kii maang kar rahe hai
 CAIT Secretary Praveen Khandelwal says that the government has exempted e-commerce people from tax for a few days
 ham maang karte hai ki baaki vyapaariyon ko bhi chhot mili
 Textile traders are also demonstrating for this'
 agar aap kharidari kaa man bana rahe hai to july se pehle online shopping kar chal rahi baari chhot kaa faaydaa le sakate hai
 And these companies will also deliver the goods to your home within a day, but after GST, it will be expensive to shop online and from the market

 CAIT ke sachiv praveen khandelwal kaa kahana he ki 'sarkaar ne i commers waalon ko kuch din ke liye tex se chhot di he
 We demand that the rest of the traders also get a discount
 iske liye kapadaa vyapaaree bhi pradarshan kar rahe hai'
 If you are planning to shop, then before July, you can take advantage of the huge discounts going on online shopping
 or ye companiyaan ek din ke andar hi saamaan aap ke ghar tak bhi pahunchaa dengi, lekin jiesti lagane ke baad online or bazaar se shopping karnaa mahangaa padegaa

 a study has revealed that sharks in the Arctic Sea may be able to cope with climate change, amid a declining shark population due to climate change and fears of a rapid decline
 vaigyanikon ke ek dal ne sand tiger shark ke daant ke ek jeevashm kaa adhyayan kiya he
 This fossil was found on Canada's Banks Island in the Arctic Sea
 yah daant aaj se 3
 8 to 5
 3 karod saal pehle ke iosin yug kaa he, jab us kshetra main samshitoshna jalwaayu hua karti thi or samudr kaa pani uski tulana main kam khaaraa hua karata tha
 Sora Kim, ocean scientist at the University of Chicago, said that on the basis of this period, it can be understood that if we do not reduce the emission of carbon dioxide today, what can happen after millions of years from today
 sand tiger shark ko khaare jal main rahanaa pasand he, lekin yah tab kam khaare jal main rahaa karata tha
 This led scientists to conclude that sharks may be able to live in rising temperatures and decreasing salinity of seawater
 discovery news ke mutabik pehle ke ek adhyayan main bataaya gaya tha ki duniya main kahin bhi samudr ke badhate taapmaana ke kaaran shark or anya jaljeev uttar kii ore kooch kar rahe hai

 conklev ke 'da great equelizer: sports and ajukeshan for aal' seshan main reliance foundation kii cheirperson and founder nita ambani ne kai muddon par baat kii
 During this, he spoke about the work done by Reliance Foundation and also discussed the goals of the Foundation
 saath hi unhone apni nijee jindagi ko lekar bhi kai sawaalon ke jawaab die
 During this, Nita Ambani also shared many things about Isha and Anant
 conklev LIVE: america or china kii barabari sirf stadium or uniwarsity se hogi: nitabata den ki haal hi main khabaren aa rahi thim ki akaash ambani kii shaadi is saal ho sakati he or yah shaadi shloka mehta se ho sakati he
 It was being told that Mukesh Ambani, one of the rich men of the country, can marry Akash to Shloka, the youngest daughter of diamond businessman Russell Mehta
 vahiin nita ambani ne shaadi kii taarikh or kisase shaadi ho rahi he, iske bare main jawaab nahin diya
 He said that we have given Akash the freedom to choose a life partner
 to kya is saal mukesh ambani ke bete kii ho jaaegi shaadi?is dauraan unhone apane sabase chote bete anant ambani ke vajan kam karne ke bare main bataaya

 Asaram, who has been accused of rape at the age of Vanaprastha, has come into the life of Asaram's life and this is in the form of Asaram's second wife
 ji haa, jail main band asaram ke haq main khul kar saamne ai ek mahila ne daawa kiya he ki vahi asaram kii asli bivi he or asaram ke uskaa sambandh koi jismani nahin, balki ruhani he
 The amazing thing is that this woman, who describes herself as Asaram's wife, has a full family
 asaram kaa jo nayaa sach ab jamaane ke saamne aayaa he wo uske puure kunbe ke liye kisi bhuuchaal se kam nahin kyonki ab duniya ke saamne aa gai he asaram kii duusari patni hone kaa daawa karne vaali maanak devi
 Yes, a wife who does not consider herself as a common man nor like other wives
 balki maanak devi kaa to kahana he ki wo asaram kii aisi patni hai, jo insaan rup main nahin, balki bhagwaan ke rup main hai
 The 72-year-old Asaram, who is jailed for rape, is not having a good time already
 zamaanat kii aas main court-kachhariyon ke chakkar lagaate-lagaate unki saansen phool rahi hai
 Advocates are also getting distressed by applying for bail and in such a situation, this new wife Avatar of Manak Devi is nothing short of a shock for Asaram and perhaps that is why Manak Devi on the one hand is describing herself as Asaram's spiritual spouse
 If, on the other hand, Asaram is a mental patient
 asaram ko jail gaye ab ek lanbaa vaqt guzar chukaa he
 He has also been continuously granting bail, but the court's heart is not yet satisfied for Asaram
 magar, isi bich jodhpur court main prakat hui maanak devi apane is prannath ke liye jo pyaar udhel rahi he, wo dekhte hi banataa he
 She says that her relationship with Asaram is not for today but for years and this relationship is not a cover-up or hide-and-weave, but is in front of the age for years
 koi saadhe paanch saal pehle jab unke bhaaiyon ne asaram se unki shaadi karwaai thi, to lakhon rupye kharch kar unhone hazaron logon ko shaadi kii daavat bhi di thi
 But among all these things, the most important thing is that if Manak Devi is the wife of Asaram, then who is Lakshmi Devi, the first wife of Asaram? Apparently, after Manak Devi appeared after about five and a half months of Asaram going to jail, we asked Manak Devi herself this question and the answer she gave was no less shocking
 maanak kaa kahana tha ki lakshmi unki patni to he hi nahin kyonki naa to asaram aam insaan hai or naa hi lakshmi devi
 Asaram is an incarnation of God and does not have the same relationship with Lakshmi as ordinary human beings
 zaahir he, maanak devi kii baton main kai pench hai or balaatkaar ke ilzaam main fansaa asaram ab nae sire se in pechon main funsane laga he
 For the first time when Manak also told his family about his marriage to Asaram, there was no surprise of the family members too
 lekin vaqt ke saath unhen ye baat samaj main aa gai ki maanak par ab asaram kaa asar sir chadh kar bol rahaa he
 Manak Devi's life was not like this before
 apane bhare-puure parivaar ke saath unki zindagi bhi sahi chal rahi thi
 Manak also had three children after his marriage, but in the meantime, Manak's life changed such a day that it changed the fate of the whole family
 aaj se koi 15 saal pehle maanak devi ek baar asaram ke ashram main gai thim or bas isi rose wo asaram kii asar main aise ain ki phir kabhi usase baahar hi nahin aa sakin
 At first, the family members tried to convince them on these claims and the matter kept quiet but gradually the condition became such that once she goes to the ashram, then she does not take the name of returning home
 And Manak does not leave Asaram's ashram until Asaram himself orders him to return home to the ashram
 ab ise aap asaram ke sammohan kaa asar kahen, kaala jaadu yaa phir kuch or maanak devi ke liye to ye ashram hi unke pati kaa ghar or unka thikaana tha
 If the family believes, Asaram has no influence on Manak Devi for years now
 unka kahana he ki ek baar to maanak devi ghar se lakhon rupye kii zevaraat lekar asaram ke ashram chali gayi iske baad wo to waapas laut ain lekin zevaraat dobaaraa nahin mili
 This time too, when Asaram was arrested and taken to the Jodhpur jail, Manak went out of the prison for his Mizajpursi and in the same Bhagdor also broke his leg
 iske baad asaram or ashram ke logon ne to use nahin poocha, alabatta ghar ke log maanak kii seva zarur karte rahe
 The condition is that how exactly Manak has a relationship with Asaram, now he does not understand even his own family members
 lekin maanak kii maane asaram se unka rishta kuch vaisaa he, jaise bhagwaan shiv se parvati kaa or jaise narayan se lakshmi ji kaa
 Although Manak Devi has been describing herself as Asaram's wife for a long time, but now the way she has openly announced this relationship with Asaram, he himself has shocked everyone from his family to Asaram's clan
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kii do divasiy rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak jari he
 Addressing the meeting of the party's national executive on Saturday, BJP national president Amit Shahnekangress attacked fiercely
 unhone kaha ki bijepi mekking india main lagi he, jabaki congress braking india main lagi he
 Along with this, he appealed to the workers to bring the achievements of the Modi government to the public
 amit shahne kaha, 'yuvaaon, mahilaon or kisaanon ke liye modi sarkaar ne kai aisi yojanaayen launch kii he, jisko janata tak pahunchaana jaruri he
 There is crop insurance scheme for farmers, then Ayushman scheme for the poor
 in yojanaon ke bare main gaanv se lekar shahar tak ke logon ko jaankaree deni he
 He said in the meeting that India's economy has grown and economic reforms have taken place
 amit shah ne congress netaa pi chidambaram par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki chidambaram and company ko kaaryakartaaon dwaara chunauti di jaani chahie ki wo fact ke aadhaar par iconomi, jidipi or jiesti ke bare main bahes karen
 Speaking on NRC, Amit Shah said that we will not let a single intruder enter our country
 haalanki bangladesh, pakistan or afghanistan se agar koi sikh-hindu-buddha or krishchan bharat se madad maangega, to unhen sharan dene ke liye taiyaar hai
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also remembered At the inaugural address of the National Executive, Shah also remembered Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 unhone kaha, 'atal bihari vaajapeyi ke nidhan ke baad yah rashtriya kaaryakarini kii pehali baithak he
 i have no words to say about them
 unke chale jane se bhartiya raajnneeti main sthaan rikt ho gaya he
 It cannot be replenished
 'unhone aage kaha ki 2 sadasyon vaali bhartiya janata party ko satta tak pahunchane main atal bihari vaajapeyi or laal krishna adwani kaa yogadan rahaa
 The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, senior BJP leader LK Advani, Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and other veteran leaders of BJP

 Vishnuvardhan will be roped in as a partner with Leander Paes at the London Olympics, while the duo of Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna are retained, and Paes and Sania Mirza will take on the court in the mixed doubles event
 tippaniyan It is clear that two teams are being sent by India in the London Olympics
 sabase bada sawaal yahaan yah he ki kya pes ko eitie kaa yah faisla manjuur hoga, kyonki unhone pehle hi eitie ko chitthee likhakar saaf kah diya tha ki vah kisi bhi junior khilaadi ke saath olympic main nahin khelenge
 According to information from sources, Leander is not happy with this decision of AITA, but Paes has not given any reply to AITA for the time being
 aise main agar pes olympic se apana naam waapas le lete hai to eitie kaa sirdard bad jayega, lekin duusari ore mahesh bhupati ke pita krishna eitie ke is faisle se khush hai
 Talking to the media, he said that Mahesh and Rohan can win medals in Olympics, but India is more likely to get medals in mixed doubles
 krishna ne yah bhi kaha ki liender ek shandaar khilaadi hai, jo kisi bhi vakt yuva khilaadiyon ko kaaphi protsaahit karte hai
 It is too early to say whether the medal comes from London, but it is certain that whatever happened in the last one week has definitely damaged Indian tennis
 landan olympic main liender pes ke saath jodidar ke rup main vishnuvardhan ko utaara jayega, jabaki mahesh bhupati or rohan bopanna kii jodi ko barkaraar rakhaa gaya he, or mixd dubles spardhaa main pes or sania mirza kii jodi court par utregi
 The comments saaf he landan olympic main bharat kii ore se do team bheji ja rahi hai
 The biggest question here is whether Pace would accept the AITA decision, as he had already written a letter to AITA clearly stating that he would not play in the Olympics with any junior player
 sutron se mil rahi jaankaree ke mutabik liender eitie ke is faisle se khush nahin hai, lekin pes ne philhal eitie ko koi jawaab bhi nahin diya he
 In such a situation, if Pace withdraws his name from the Olympics, then the headache of AITA will increase, but on the other hand, Mahesh Bhupathi's father Krishna is happy with this decision of AITA
 media se baat karte hue unhone kaha ki mahesh or rohan olympic main medal jeet sakate hai, lekin bharat ko mixd dubles main medal milane kii zyada sambhaavna he
 Krishna also said that Leander is a great player who encourages young players at any time
 landan se medal aata he yaa nahin, yah kahana jaldbaaji hogi, lekin tay he ki jo kuch pichley ek hafte main hua, usne bhartiya tennis ko nuksaan zarur pahunchaaya he
 It is clear that two teams are being sent by India in the London Olympics

 ram kaa naam phir se charchaa main he
 Those are the same old faces brought to the discussion
 lekin is baar peeth bachaakar bayaan die ja rahe hai
 Someone is talking about the Ramayana Museum in Ayodhya, while someone is promising to build a theme park here
 isamen kuch aise bhi hai jo ram mandir se kam kuch nahin jaise apane puraane naaron se dhul jhaadkar maidan main kud pade hai
 Suddenly names like Sakshi Maharaj, Subramanian Swamy, Vinay Katiyar, Uma Bharti, Mahesh Sharma are seen chanting Ram
 ram raaj paane kii seedhi ban gaye hai
 The clouds of elections are disturbing, Ramka wants to cross the umbrella and cross over
 ram kya koi swimming pool hai ki jab man kiya, nahaane ke liye kachche pahanakar kud pade
 Are there any political parties serious towards Ram or is it just a dirty game of cashing in on him
 bhaajapa ko pataa he ki soobe main satta main aa paanaa aasaan nahin he
 The air of publicity is still far from the ground truth
 vahiin sapa ko bhi vishwaas nahin ki wo waapas soobe main sattashin ho sakegi
 Then what goes into saying
 ram ke naam par vaade kii koi zamaanat kisi ko nahin deni hoti
 When the elections are in front, see how many colors Ram's name still shows

 ) In order to focus on the economic downturn in the country, Chandrayaan-2 mission is being beaten in such a way that it seems that such missions were not started before Modi came to power, speaking on the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamta Banerjee said that there is an economic downturn in the country

 What are the lessons of the Bharatiya Janata Party's crushing defeat in the Delhi Assembly elections? a senior BJP leader says with a smile on the face, "our government is being formed in Jammu and Kashmir
 fark yah aa gaya he ki pehle ham apana mukhyamantri yaa roteshan main mukhyamantri kii kursi kii shart rakh rahe the, lekin ab puure chah saal ke liye pidipi kaa mukhyamantri hoga or hamaara up-mukhyamantri
 He also adds that the PDP has only three more seats than the BJP in Kashmir and it is also a coincidence that the party got only three out of 70 seats in Delhi elections
 yani ve ishaaron main dilli chunaavon ke bijepi kii siyasat par asar kaa izhaar kar dete hai
 His talk also reflects the dissatisfaction that has been brewing in the organization for the past nine months towards the working style of the party leadership and in the satire it is said that the workers have a bigger role than the leadership in the victory chariot of the party, which is to be ignored in Delhi
 Show haalanki jammu-kashmir main sarkaar banaakar bijepi hataasha ke maahaul se ubar rashtriya str par sandesh dena chaahati he
 However, after the Delhi elections, the central leadership of the BJP has realized that the organization cannot be run in the corporate style
 lekin ab party kaa bada lakshya bihar he or sangh bhi kisi surat main is maukey ko ganvaana nahin chahta
 Therefore, taking lessons from Delhi's defeat, the state unit has been given clear instructions that no outsiders should be given the confidence of tickets while joining the party
 itnaa hi nahin, dilli kii haar ke baad hi bijepi ne jedy (you) main tod-phod kii bajaae nitish kumaar kii sarkaar banane main zyada adchane nahin daaleen
 Says a leader close to Shah, "now the activists have got a chance to speak who were still silent
" '' lekin sanghathan kii kaaryastylee main kis tarah kaa badlaav laayaa jaae, is bare main koi thos faisla dilli kii haar kii report par holi ke baad nagpur main hone vaali sangh kii akhil bhartiya pratinidhi sabha kii baithak ke baad hi liya jayega
 Mourning over defeat Delhi's defeat has forced the party and the Sangh Parivar to introspect
 sangh ne report talab kar bijepi kii mushkilen badha deen
 The BJP has not yet held a formal meeting at the central level to review the defeat
 dilli bijepi se haar kii report maangane kii bajaae rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne sanghathan mahasachiv raamalaal se report banane ko kaha he
 Ramlal has completed seven meetings in this episode with state BJP in-charge Prabhat Jha, state president Satish Upadhyay and mps of the concerned region
 pradesh ikai main gutbaji ko dekhte hue badi surgery kii sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he, nateezon ke baad dilli bijepi ke netaaon ke chehron par chintaa kii lakeeren dekhakar centre kii ore se chunaav main bhoomika nibhaane vaale ek varisht netaa ne dhants bandhaaya, ''kaaryakartaaon ko zyada chintaa nahin kerani chahie
 The results of this election have put a blackmail on everyone's face and no one is in a position to say anything to anyone
 '' is varisht netaa kaa ishaara saaf tha ki dilli main chunaav main pradesh ikai ko kahin bharose main nahin liya gaya
 However, state BJP in-charge Prabhat Jha refuses to say anything about the election churn
 ve kehete hai, ''main itnaa hi kahana chaahunga ki ham desh kaa mood bhaanp gaye the, lekin dilli kaa mood nahin bhaanp paae
 "state President Satish Upadhyay says in a philosophical manner," When the storm comes, all is uprooted
 abhi to ham use sametane main hi lage hai
 However, the reasons for the defeat are being considered as a decision to change the committees from district to mandal level just a month before the assembly elections because the old team got annoyed
 sangh kii paathshaaladilli kii haar main sangh ko lapete jane se sangh ke kai netaa aahat the
 So on the third day of the election results, Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat himself met with the three co-sarkaryawahs including Sarkaryavah Bhaiyya ji Joshi, and the next day Bhaiyya ji, co-sarkaryavah Krishna Gopal and Suresh Soni, playing the role of coordinator with BJP, BJP general secretary Ramlal, Ram Madhav and Union Health Minister J
 pi
 Had a meeting with Nadda
 sutron ke mutabik, is baithak main bhaiyya ji ne do-took puch liya, ''yah sanghathan kii haar he yaa sarkaar kii
 In this meeting, the Sangh fiercely took the class of BJP leaders
 bijepi netaaon se poocha gaya ki sadsyta abhiyaan par party ne itnaa jor diya he or vah 5-6 karod sadsy bana liye jane kaa daawa kar rahi he, lekin badi party banakar kya laabh jab vot hi nahin mili
 According to sources, this leader said that the bjp's member count is increasing as if a wrestler is increasing the number of his punishment meetings daily
 sangh parivaar ke sutron ke mutabik, bijepi ne aakhri vakt main baaji haath se nikalate dekh voting se teen din pehle sangh se booth prabandhan ke liye madad maangi thi or isse yah sandesh gaya ki sangh kii takat jhonke jane ke baavjood bijepi buree tarah haari
 The Sangh leaders argued that the BJP should not bring the Sangh into its internal strife
 ranneeti par bana rahaa asamanjasbijepi ko haar kii koi ek badi vajah nahin mili he
 But according to sources, in the report of the organization general secretary Ramlal, many facts have emerged which directly put the central leadership in the dock
 haalanki abhi yah tay nahin he ki party yah report jas kii tas sangh ko saunpegi yaa nahin
 Almost all of them are assuming that there was no synergy in the strategies being made at the central, state and union levels for elections
 phir, 200 saansadon ko utaarne or baahar ke kaaryakartaaon-netaaon ko lagane kii ranneeti bhi naakaam rahi
 Most people from outside started treating local workers as bosses
 tikat bantwaare main bhi aam aadmi party se nakaare gaye chehron ko tarjeeh di gai
 The opinion of the mps of Delhi was not given due consideration
 pravesh verma apane kareebi ko tikat nahin dilava paae
 Ramesh Vidhudi's nephew Vikram Vidhuri got a ticket, but Vidhuri wanted Sarita Chaudhary to not get a ticket from Mehrauli seat, so she threw out the name of state president Satish Upadhyay
 isi tarah saansad manoj tiwari bhi buraadi seat se apane saansad pratinidhi ke liye tikat maang rahe the, udit raaj bhi apane bhattije ke liye tikat chaah rahe the, jabaki saansad minakshi lekhi to kejariwal ke mukaable nupur sharma ko tikat die jane ke khilaaf thim
 Harshavardhana from Krishnanagar wanted to get his son a ticket
 saansad mahesh giri ne apana chunaav prabandhan sanbhaalane vaale hukum singh ko kondli se tikat dilaa diya
 Apart from this, the equation of Delhi's population was also ignored
 aam aadmi party ne 14 purvaanchaliyon ko tikat diya or sabhi jitkar aae, lekin bijepi ne siton kii bajaae purvanchal kaa kota tay karke tikat diya
 Local leaders were also not taken into confidence in bringing Kiran Bedi
 harshavardhan jaise varisht netaa ko bhi krishnanagar seat se bedi ko chunaav ladaane kii phone par jaankaree di gai
 In the campaign, the biggest mistake of BJP was to keep the Congress out of the competition and make the whole strategy according to AAP
 isse congress ke saare vot kejariwal kii ore mud gaye
 The loss report mentions seats like Mustafabad, Vishwasnagar, where the Congress won more votes then the BJP won
 sutron ke mutabik, modi ke 10 lakh vaale suut kaa bhi galat sandesh gaya or pradhanmantri ne jis bhashaa style main kejariwal ko naksali, araajaktaavaadi kaha, vah bhi logon ko bura laga
 The party has done all the hard work in the publicity material through the rowdy gotra, garland on Anna's photo, etc
 dilli bijepi main yah jumala khub chal rahaa he ki modi or shah kii nirankush kaaryastylee se khafa kaaryakartaaon ne milakar dilli main jawaab diya
 Diesel and LPG prices may rise soon
 vitt mantri pranab mukherjee ne iske sanket die hai
 There is a possibility that the government may take this step after the budget session
 sansad main ek sawaal ke jawaab main vitt mantri ne kaha ki bajet satr ke baad vah is mudde par rajya sarkaron raajnneetik dalon ke pramukhon se baat karenge
 In response to a question in Parliament, the Finance Minister said that after the budget session, he will talk to the heads of state governments political parties on this issue

 The beginning of 2017 has not been a good year for the Delhi Metro
 janvari ke maheene main hi metro chaar baar takneekee kharabiyon se rubaru ho chuki he
 This is not a good sign for this spectacular ride called the Pride of Delhi
 metro ke liye ye kharabiyaan kitni gambhir or phikrmand karne vaali hai, uskaa andaaza isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki dmarsi komusafiron se maafeebhi maangani padi he
 But why is this malfunction in Delhi Metro? Why are technical faults coming to Delhi metro again and again? While searching for answers to all these questions, ten big reasons were revealed
 ye wo vajah hai, jo metro ke liye chunauti bhi hai or metro kii kamajori bhi banati ja rahi hai
 
 
 1
 metro musafiron kii sankhya kaa record ban chukaa he
 32 lakh people have traveled in a day
 aise main metro system ke liye zarurat se zyada musafir samasya ban rahe hai, kyonki bheed kii vajah se choti si takneekee kharabi bhi puure metro system ko thap kar detii he
 Because of the time it takes to fix the technical problem, at the same time due to congestion at the metro stations, other problems start
 2
 Metro completed its 14 years of operation only in December last month and in these 14 years the track system of the metro has become outdated, which needs constant maintenance
 lekin subah paanch baje se raat ek baje tak trek par metro oparation main rahati he, aise main sudhaar ke kaam ke liye vakt bahut kam miltaa he or agar din main koi kharabi aati he, to metro kii sevaayen buree tarah prabhavit ho jaati hai
 3
 metro kii oechai yani overhead electricity line main tripping bhi dilli metro ke liye pareshaani kii ek badi vajah he
 In particular, due to fault in OHE on Blue Line and Yellow Line, many times the speed has been broken at metro
 4
 The pantograph of Metro train is also a major reason for technical defects
 pentrograph main sparking kii vajah se kai baar metro main aag bhi lag chuki he or dhuaan nikalne ke maamle saamne aae hai, jiske baad metro ko khaali karakar train ko sarvice se hataanaa padaa he
 5
 metro kaa rolling stock yani metro train ke dabbe, wheel kii umr bhi kaaphi ho chuki he
 The trains which were brought in the early days of the metro, have started to malfunction
 6
 Power failure has also become a common problem in the metro
 bijli gul hone kii vajah se metro kii sevaayen ruk jaati hai
 Although the metro has a facility that can take the metro train out of the tunnels to platforms or stations in the event of a power failure, the services of the metro are severely affected while doing so
 7
 The entire metro system runs on automatic train operation
 aise main software main agar chand minutes ke liye bhi koi pareshaani aati he, to puure system main afratfari much jaati he
 8
 metro main signling system bhi metro kii kharabi kii ek pramukh vajah he, jahaan kharabi kii vajah se kai baar manual oparation karnaa padataa he
 Due to this, the speed of the metro has to be reduced
 9
 Platforms are open at metro stations
 aise main bheed kii vajah se kai baar musafir treks par gir jate hai yaa phir suicide ke maamle bhi metro ke liye pareshaani ban rahe hai
 10
 ek samasya musafiron kii galatiyon yaa niyam todane kii vajah se bhi aati he
 Many times, passengers press the emergency button without any reason or sometimes they stop the doors being closed, due to door obstruction also affects the service of the metro
 madhya pradesh sarkaar ne somvaar ko iees afasar ajay gangavar ko modi ke virodh main kii gai fasebuk post ko like karne par jawaab talab kiya gaya he
 Recently, Ajay came into the limelight from his Facebook post about Gangwarnehru and Gandhi family
 iske baad unka tabadalaa kar diya gaya tha
