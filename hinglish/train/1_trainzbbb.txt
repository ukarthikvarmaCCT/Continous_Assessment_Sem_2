 soshal media par maujuud lagbhag har yujar isi par baat kar rahaa tha
 But has West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee criticized ISRO scientists over the failure of Chandrayaan-2 and said, 'don't try to do things you can't do'? Imitated, Mamata Banerjee has been accused of making a false claim that she made fun of ISRO
 is blog site kaa naam indiatodaydailynews
 blogspot
 com he
 This blog claims that Mamata Banerjee became enraged at the failure of Mission Chandrayaan-2 and condemned ISRO, saying, 'you don't need to do something you can't do
 ' is lekh main media santhaan india today kaa jhootha hawala diya gaya he
 This is a blog that constantly posts fake news

 See the link here: Click on the link posted on this page indiatodaydailynews
 blogspot
 The page of the fake blog site named com opens where this article is posted
 yah post fasebuk par viral he jise kai fasebuk yugers ne share kiya he
 This article claimed, 'mamata Banerjee has been making anti-india comments on everything from the martyrdom of Indian soldiers in Pulwama to the launch of isro's Chandrayaan and has made such a statement after which it is difficult for anyone to be an Indian is
 'lekh main aage kaha gaya he, 'pichley kuch saalon main ve modi or bijepi kii aalochana karti rahi hai or kai bharat-virdohi bayaan die hai
 'what is Sachindia Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) tried to know if Mamata Banerjee really made any such statement? But we could not find anything like this
 hamen google kiward search kii madad se bhi mamata kaa aisa koi bayaan nahin mila
 Instead we got Mamata Banerjee's statement in which she congratulated ISRO scientists for mission Chandrayaan-2
 We are proud of our scientists
 The @ isroteam worked hard for # Chandrayaan2
 a befitting tribute to our founding fathers who envisioned India’s place in the league of scientifically advanced nations far ahead of their times
 (1 / 2) - Mamata Banerjee (@mamataofficial) September 7, 2019 But at the same time Mamata Banerjee criticized Prime Minister Modi and BJP for using Mission Chandrayaan-2 to divert people's attention from the economic downturn in the country
 Have been
 chandrayan-2 ko lekar mamata banerjee ke bayaan parmediamein khabaren bhi chhapin
 India Today also published news on this
 tiemasi kii aalochana ke baad bijepi ne bhi mamata par kataaksh kiya, lekin tiemasi ne phir se palatwaar kiya-linkapa media santhaan india today kii website koyahandekh sakate hai, jabaki india today ke naam par chal rahi farji blog site kaa screenshotyahandekh sakate hai
 The conclusion thus became clear that Mamata Banerjee did not criticize ISRO scientists, instead she congratulated the scientists and criticized BJP for making political use of Mission Chandrayaan

 bijepi vidhayakane kaha tha ki desh kii sabhi samasyaayein jawaharlal nehru, indira gandhi, rajeev gandhi or sonia gandhi kii vajah se hai

 Everyone's life changes after marriage, this is what we all know, but does life change even after getting married to someone whom we have known for many years
 maine aksar apane doston ko shaadi ke baad pachhataate hue dekha tha
 However, after marriage, not only did negative changes happen in their life, but some good things also happened
 main apane doston ke group main akelaa bachaler tha or unki baaten sunne ke alaava mere paas koi or rasta nahin tha
 i often thought in my mind that my life would not go through such changes after marriage because i knew that i would make my girlfriend my life partner
 main apni garlfriend ko pichley 10 saalon se jaanata tha
 After marriage, i was proved wrong
 shaadi ke ek saal baad meri jindagi main kai saare badlaav aa gaye
 1- It is a beautiful feeling to see him first after waking up every morning
 bilkul swaabhaavik rup main bina kisi mechap ke, puure sukun ke saath use sote hue dekhnaa bahut hi alag ehsaas he
 Small marks on his face remind me of his teenager days and i love him even more
 shaadi se pehle partner ke bare main jaan len ye baaten2-pehle ham jab nite out kiya karte the to hamaara romance alag tarah kaa tha
 Now we see each other very closely everyday and physical love no longer matters to us
 ham ek-duusare ke prati behad sahaj ho chuke hai
 Our romance is like a glass of old wine that we want to enjoy slowly and we are in no hurry
 3-main sweekaar karnaa chaahunga ki chaahe ladkaa ho yaa ladki, shaadi ke baad aap kharch sanbhalkar karne lagate hai or bhavishya ke bare main zyada sochane lagate hai
 My wife now thinks twice before spending
 ab vah har roj mujhase phool laane kii ummid bilkul nahin karti he jabaki jab vah meri garlfriend thi to use ye sab behad pasand tha
 Future planning sitting together is a good experience
 shaadi ke bare main ye baaten chhupate hai aapke mata-pita4-shaadi ke baad mujhe uskaa ek nayaa paksh dekhne ko mila
 Whenever i return home late, whether from office or friends house, she gets a little upset
 jabaki shaadi se pehle vah deree se ghar jane par kuch nahin kahati thi shaayad kyonki main uski vajah se hi ghar let pahunchataa tha!5-shaadi kaa sabase bada phayda yah he ki ab ladaai hone ke baad mujhe brake-ap kii chintaa nahin rahati he
 Every fight ended with a break-up when we dated

 After this, there were reports that the producers agreed to remove the scenes related to the film
 party kaa aarope tha ki film main notebandi or jiesti ko nakraatmak dhang se dikhaaya gaya he
 Even after the controversies, Mursal broke 100 crores in 3 days, broke Rajinikanth's record, in which BJP party said that the film has given 'wrong information' about GST and demonetisation
 film main bataaya gaya he ki sarkaar jiesti le rahi he, lekin logon ko uske badale koi bhi suvidha nahin mil rahi he
 In view of the demand to remove some dialogues of 'mersal', Rahul Gandhi also targeted PM Modi
 rahul gandhi ne twit kar piem modi ko kaha- 'mistar modi cinema tamil samskruti or bhashaa kii gahari abhivyakti he
 Do not try to suppress it by interfering with the pride of Tamils
 'mr
 Modi, Cinema is a deep expression of Tamil culture and language
 Don't try to demon-etise Tamil pride by interfering in Mersal— Office of RG (@officeofrg)october 21, 2017indu sarkaar flop film thi, marsal ke saath tulana kisi- nagamarahul gandhi ke twit ke baad ye vivaad itnaa garma gaya ki ab ye maanon rashtri mudda ban gaya
 After Rahul Gandhi, former finance minister Chidambaram too jumped into the controversy and tweeted sarcastically at the Modi government, saying that a law should be enacted in which only government policies are appreciated in documentaries
 ' twit main likhaa, 'bhaajapa marsal ke dialog hataane kii maang kar rahi he
 Imagine, what would have happened if a film like 'parashakti' had been released in today's situation
 ' ek duusare twit main unhone kaha, 'film nirmaataaon ke liye soochna : kanoon aane vaala he, ab aap keval vahi vruttchitr bana sakate hai, jisamen sarkaar kii saraahna kii jaae
 'notice to film makers: Law is coming, you can only make documentaries praising government's policies

 Chidambaram (@pchidambaram_in) October 21, 2017 What's the story of the film? The Vijay Starrer film based on the country's medical mafia featured some scenes related to GST and Natabandi
 bijepi ne film ke seens kaa virodh karte hue inhen hataane kii maang kii thi
 According to the report of a local local channel, the makers agreed to remove some scenes after the objection
 atali ke nirdesan main bani is film main medical mafia ke khilaaf ladaai dikhaai gai he
 It has received mixed reviews, but the action scene of Superstar Vijay has been well received
 film main kaajal agarwal, nitya menon or samantha bhi najar ai hai
 Dear Friends, It is only a few weeks when the people of Gujarat will participate in the biggest festival of democracy, elections
 mujhe pichley kuch maheenon ke dauraan aap sabase milane ke kai avasar mili
 Vivekananda Yuva Vikas Yatra, Happy New Year or meetings with party workers
 gujarat kii bhavy jeevantta or ashaavadita ko dekhakar mujhe apaar khushi kaa anubhav hua
 The new heights of development that we have found during the last decade were not possible without political stability
 aap main se kai logon ne us gujarat ko bhi dekha hoga jahaan sarkarein tikti hi nahin thim
 To gain power, the musical chair game used to go on
 parantu ab vah sab itihaas ban gaya he
 Solidarity and stability in policy making have benefited the people
 raajnneetik sthirataa gujarat ke logon kii drushti or doordarshita kaa nateeja he, jinhone kisi anya cheez kii bajaae vikaas main vishwaas jataayaa
 But, to me, this greatest contribution means something more - it is a fact that Gujarat has strengthened people's faith in democracy and political system in a few years, that too after so many years of independence, when Congress ruled and weakened it
 Had done it
 mujhase kai baar yah prashn poocha jaataa he- modi ji, gujarat ne pichley 11 varshon main koun-sa ullekhneey yogadan diya he
 You can expect me to say the same - we have consistently reduced the school drop rate, done a great job of educating girls, brought the light of development to tribal areas, connected the poorest of the poor with technology, Gujarat Built an industrial center, we witnessed record growth in agriculture, etc
 apni baat ko ek udhaaharan se spasht karnaa chaahunga
 In the 1980s, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said that when one rupee reaches the village it becomes 15 paise! This statement shocked me
 jab rajeev gandhi ne yah baat kahi thi, tab puure desh main raajnneetik rup se congress kaa hi shashan tha
 The Congress ranged from Panchayat to Parliament and we were nowhere
 is baat se kya siddh hota he- yahi ki samasyaon ko soochibaddh karne main congress ko maharath hasil he, lekin jab baat aati he samaadhaan kii to ham unase koi ummid nahin rakh sakate
 Today, i feel proud to say that when one rupee comes out of Gandhinagar, every penny of it reaches the beneficiary
 bichauliyon ko pehle hi bahut kam kiya ja chukaa he
 This has also been a major reason for building people's trust in the system
 unheen niyamon or usee set-ap ke saath gujarat ne dikhaa diya he ki aam aadmi kii jindagi main kis tarah gunatmak badlaav laayaa ja saktaa he
 You will also be surprised to know the allegations being made against us
 aarope hai- 'aapane 500 skulon kii bajaae 350 skulon kaa hi nirmaan karaayaa he'
 Or 'you have made 8 km of road instead of 10 km!' The focal point of the allegations is also development
 par, kya ham yahi baat congressi mitron ke liye bhi kah sakate hai? nahin! koi unase vikaas ke bare main prashn karne kii jahamat nahin uthaata
 Only the number of scams can be talked about
 mitro, mul rup se antar sirf raajnneetik style kaa he
 BJP has always done politics keeping development in mind, Congress has always been doing politics of vote bank
 yaad kiijie, kaise unhone gujarat main bhai se bhai ko alag kiya, mitron se mitron ko juda kiya
 Be it a rath yatra or a cricket match, there was curfew in the state
 aaj, yadi aap kisi bachche se karfu kaa matlab puuchhenge to shaayad use pataa nahin hoga
 This difference has come in the span of a decade
 main aksar kahata hum- yadi congress ko gujarat chahie to unhen votbank kii raajnneeti chhodkar vikaas kii raajnneeti kii raah pakadani chahie
 Until then, the people of Gujarat, knowing everything, will not give them a chance to enter the soil here
 pichley kuch dinon main main hamaare kai kaaryakartaaon se mila hum or maine jo josho-kharosh or utsaah unamem dekha he, unhen shabdon main bayaan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Our true strength is our workers and i congratulate them for their commendable work
 main unhen vishwaas dilaataa hum ki unke prayaas vyarth nahin jaaenge
 From January 2013, we will move more strongly towards a grand and divine Gujarat
 20 disambar 2012 ko humlog ek or diwali manaayenge or yah ab tak kii sabase bhavy hogi
 
 
 -narendra Modi duniya ke sabase khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathan iesas ke sargana bagdadi kaa samrajya ab khatme kii ore he
 Baghdadi has now conceded defeat to the Iraqi army and Kurdish fighters
 usne apane vidaai bhaashan main arab ke baahar se aae iesas ke ladaako ko aadesh diya he ki ve apane vatan laut jaaen yaa khud ko bam se uda len
 Baghdadi Yeh Bol has emerged as the last sign of her barbarity
 yah vahi bagdadi he, jisaki darindagi ke aage khuf bhi khuf khaane laga thi
 Baghdadi is a living effigy of terror and horror in the world
 iske ishaare par pichley dhai saalon se anginat log maut ke ghat utaare ja chuke hai, lekin maut, maut main bhi fark hota he
 The death that Baghdadi gives to its enemies is beyond human thought
 iraq or syria kii retili zamin se hote hue maut itane khaufnak tareeke duniya tak pahunche, jitne na kabhi dekhe gaye or na kabhi soche gaye
 Let's know about 10 ways of death by Baghdadi and its terrorists
 bagdadi ke 10 chehre yani maut ke 10 tareekabagdadi kaa cheharaa number-1- sir kalam19 june, 2016, raka, syria, iesas ke julmo-sitam ke itihaas main ye shaayad ab tak kaa sabase kaala din tha, kyonki is roj iesas ne mahaz chaar saal kii ek bacchee kaa sir kalam kar diya
 Although there is no hope for isis's suffering, but what could have been the reason behind the beheading of such a small girl? So the answer is, his mother should swear in the name of Allah
 phool si bacchee wo is manahuus tarikh ko apni maa ke saath ghar se baahar nikal ai thi
 His mother wanted to send him home, but was not ready
 wo jid karne lagi
 Then the mother angrily swore by Allah that if she did not go home, she would cut off her head
 bas, itani si baat aatankwaadiyon ke kaanon main pad gai
 Then the terrorists asked the mother to cut the head of the child, but when she did not agree to it, the terrorists themselves cut the head of the girl and shaken her mother's hands with her blood
 darasal iesas apni shuruyaat se hi dushmano kaa sir kalam karata rahaa he
 Or rather it is his favorite way to kill enemies
 iesas ne 25 july 2014 ko jab pehali baar ek saath 75 syrian phogiyon kaa sir kalam kiya tha, to duniya chaunk gai thi
 After this, he beheaded exactly how many people, no one has the exact account of it
 alabatta british or america bandhakon ko camere ke saamne iesas ke jallaadon kaa shikaar banate duniya ne kai baar dekha or ye silsilaa ab bhi jari he
 Baghdadi's face number-2-shot in the head showed ISIS to the world how horrible it can be to make someone sit on the ground on their knees and shoot them in their head
 darindagi kii sari hadon se aage nikal kar is aatankwaadi sanghathan ne namaaloom kitnon ko aise hi sir main goli maar kar maut ke ghat utaar diya or apane dushmano ke saath uskaa ye suluk ab bhi chal rahaa he
 But in some of its propaganda videos, ISIS has crossed all limits
 iesas ke aatankwaadi ab tak khud apane shikaar logon goli maaraa karte the, lekin ab usne ye kaam maasoom bacchon se bhi karana shuru kar diya
 Yes, ISIS started shooting its enemies by shooting innocent children in the name of Cubs of Khalifet, the cubs of Khilafat
 vaise to iesas ke kaanoon kii qitabon main har gunaah ke liye apni alag sazaa he
 But usually those caught in espionage crime give such death
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-3-upar se phenk kar maarnafrj kiijie kisi shaks ke haath paanv bediyon main jakade hai
 He is surrounded by shadows of bayonets, and even if he runs away, he cannot even breathe on his own
 use usee haalat main kisi imaarat kii sabase upree manzil par le jaaya jaataa he
 Then, after telling the story of his crimes by profiteering among the people standing under the building, he is pushed straight down from above
 ye ek aisa manzar he, jiske bare main soch kar hi rongte khadey ho jate hai
 But being gay under the rule of ISIS is a crime for which this is the only death
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-4-sangsar kar maaranasangsar karnaa yani pattharon se kuchal kar jaan lenaa
 Can some humans crush the lives of people like themselves with stones? It is difficult for you to think, even today, in many hardline Muslim countries, doing so is within the scope of law
 phir iesas to nafrat or kattarpan kii sari hadon se aage he
 Therefore, ISIS has also often taken lives in such a painful manner
 vaise sangsar kaa shikaar aksar waisi mahilaayein zyaada hoti hai, jin par kisi se najayas rishton kaa ilzaam lagata he
 Baghdadi's face number-5 - Burning in the fire The death of these Turkish soldiers imprisoned in Panjrera revived the dwindling terror of Baghdadi
 syria main turki ke dakhal se baukhalaaye bagdadi ne in sainikon ko maut dene se pehle pinjre main band kiya
 Kneeling like animals and then wrote such a speech of hagiography, which probably will not be forgotten so easily
 barood se bhari in pattiyon ko zanjiron ke zarie in tak pahunchaaya gaya or phir inhen usase jakad diya gaya
 There is no scope of escape in these chains of iron
 maut se pehle khauf ke har ek lamhe ko bagdadi ke gurgey camere par record kar rahe hai
 Due to fear, his throat has become so dry
 petrol main pehle hi nahalaae ja chuke in turki sainikon ko ek ishaara milte maut kii aag main jhonk diya gaya
 The black veneer Yamraj took out the remote of death
 ye remote darasal us barood kaa trigar he jo is lohe kii chen se guzarati hui inke jismon ko chhu rahi he
 The trigger was pressed and the gunpowder caught fire
 lamhaa lamhaa maut tezi se badhane lagi
 Life burnt to death in these flames
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-6-boat main bithakar maarnataarikh main shaayad hi kisi jallaad ne maut ke itane tareeke nikaale ho jitne is ek saal main bagdadi ne apane gunahagaaron ko die, jo maut usne in 6 bandhakon ko di khuda kare waisi koi kisi ko na de
 These ISIS poachers have done many things to play this painful game of death
 ek ek kar inhen is safed boat main bithaaya gaya
 It is seen in the video that two hostages were already seated and these two terrorists are holding the remaining four hostages by the neck and taking them towards the boat
 do do ke jode main in bandhakon ko boat main bitha diya gaya
 The fear of death is clearly visible on everyone's face
 ye jaanate hai ki yahaan se batch paanaa naammumkin he, lekin magar jaalim bagdadi ke bandhakon ko maut bhi aasaani se nahin milti
 It is also difficult to guess the horror of the very young boys sitting in the boat
 naav main bithakar pehle inke haath pair baandh die gaye
 The boat was then abandoned in the middle of the water
 boat pani main tair rahi, maut raftaa raftaa kareeb aati rahi
 Baghdadi's face number-7 - drowned in water is the cage of Mao Lohe from which it is impossible to get out
 pinjre main lage chote-chote camere
 These cruel terrorists will record the scene of death in it
 ek-ek kar 5 kaidiyon ko naarangi rang ke jampasoot pahana kar pinjre main bheja gaya
 There is a fear of death on everyone's faces
 tabhi ek ishaara milte hi kraine is pinjade ko pani ke bich-bich le ai or dhire dhire pinjade ko pani main duubano shuru kar diya gaya
 The cage was first filled in half and then to the mouth
 pijadaa pani ke andar chalaa gaya or jab waapas nikaala gaya to saansein ruk chuki thim
 He tied the face of Baghdadi with number 8-explosive and killed the seven people who came under the claws of ISIS in the blasphemous crime that left the world shaken
 narsanhaar kii ye tasviren aisi he ki inhen kisi bhi surat dikhaa paanaa mumkin nahin he
 7 people were taken captive to the open ground
 sabhi kaidiyon ke haath peeche kar ke baandh gaye or inaki gardanon main nile rang kii explosive vir ko baandha gaya phir datonator ke dhamaake ke saath in sabhi kii jivan lila ko samaapt kar diya
 Seeing this, perhaps even the greatest abuser may tremble
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-9-car main dhamaake se udanachar kaidiyon ko iesas ke aatanki is tarah maut ke kareeb le gaye
 Hands tied gardan aatankiyon ne jakad main
 One by one, he was seated and tied in this car
 car ko baahar se lock kiya gaya
 They were left alone to travel from here to death
 phir ek aatanki ke haathon main nazar aayaa puri tarah se lod mortar launture
 Whose target was on the car
 ek ishaare ke baad mortar chali or sidhe is car main ja dhansi
 With a blast, the people sitting in the car flew away
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-10-suuli par lataka kar maaranasuuli par latakaane kii tasviren aatank ke samrajya se bahut ain
 But the manner in which the American spies were killed by the terrorists of this year-old war is difficult to convey the generosity in words
 kasaai khaane main jis tarah jibha karne ke baad jaanavar ko latakaaya jaataa he
 Similarly, in order to hang these hostages, the terrorists first tied their hands and then they were dragged one by one to the place where the death took place
 phir unhen ulataa lataka diya gaya
 In this way everyone was shocked by the dreadful death
 loksabhaa 2019 chunaav main upi ke jitani kisi rajya ko tavajjo mili to vah pashchim bengal rahaa
 The political rhetoric that took place between PM Narendra Modi and Mamta Banerjee has hardly happened to anyone else
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main sabhi 7 charan kii voting 19 may ko puri ho gai or agsit pole ke nattejey ghoshit kar die gaye hai

 Gathered, which shows not only their financial status but also anger

 There was agitation to name after Ambedkar, most worsened
 koprdi cond ne bheetar hi bheetar khaulate kai saare asantosh ko hawa de di he
 Till now the Maratha community has organized demonstrations in several places including Aurangabad, Osmanabad, Jalgaon, Beed and Parbhani and on an average has been attended by three lakh people

 The Marathas' anger against the law erupted following reports that accused of the Kopardi scandal had allegedly threatened to sue the victim's family under the law
 is baat ke saboot to kam hi hai par yah netaaon ko bhavanaaen bhadakaane se roak nahin sakaa
 Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) President Raj Thackeray said, "the Prevention of Atrocities Act needs to be thrown out completely
 " vahiin maratha netaa or rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ke mukhiya sharad pavaar kii daleel thi ki is ''kanoon main sanshodhan kiya janaa chahie
 "pawar wrapped it in the syrup of sympathy for the Dalits and claimed that this law was misused by the upper castes
 sthaneey netaa apane jhagadon ko nipataane ke liye daliton kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 The leaders made a rash of irresponsible statements
 unamem se ek ne to maratha ladki or dalit ladke ke prem par aadhaarit lokapriy film sarat par iljaam madh diya
 Some protesters said that the film misrepresented Maratha girls
 maratha kranti morcha (pradarshan isi ke binar tale ho rahe hai) jor pakad rahaa he
 Meetings are being held in every district of Maharashtra
 kai siyasatdan bahati ganga main haath dhone kii koshish main hai
 Purushottam Khedekar, founder of Maratha Seva Sangh and leader of Sambhaji Brigade, says, "our opposition is not only against the Prevention of Atrocities Act, it is also for the need of reservation
 " satara se ensipi ke saansad or chhatrapati shivaji ke ek vanshaj udayanraaje bhosle kehete hai, ''is kanoon ke tahat darj kareeb 90 fisadi maamle farji hai
 “dalits have responded to the Marathas’ protests by organizing their demonstrations
 kendriya saamaajik nyaay rajyamantri ramdaas athawale ne kaha ki atyaachaar nirodhak kanoon ko radd nahin kiya ja saktaa

 They have been under the occupation of the Marathas
 ve kehete hai, ''ye sansthaaen mar rahi hai kyonki rashtriyakrut bainkon or nijee kshetra ne gramin bazaar ko bhi hathiyaa liya he
 Marathas dominated because they had control over the economy

 So they are restless
 " ensipi ne iskaa phayda uthaane kii koshish kii or ishaara kiya ki ek brahman mukhyamantri devendra fadavis ke maatahat maraathon ke saath ninsaphi hona tay tha
 At the same time, the Chief Minister says, "these protests are inspired by politics and are being made in an attempt to remove me from the chair
 main baatcheet se is mudde kaa hal nikaalnaa chahta hum
 “power has been in the hands of Marathas for a long time in the state and as Prof
 pavaar kehete hai, ''chunki maratha maanate hai ki ve janmajaat shaasha hai, so ve apni ghati hui siyaasi haisiyat se talmail bithaane kii jaddojahad kar rahe hai
 "hearing is going on in the Supreme Court in a case of giving 16 per cent reservation to Marathas
 agar yah maang manjuur ho jaati he to anya pichhadi jatiyon (obisi) ko lag saktaa he ki isse unke 27 fisadi aarakshan main katautee ho sakati he
 According to analysts, caste problems can emerge as a big challenge
 maratha kranti morcha ne indore ke aadhyatmik guru bhaiyyu maharaj ko ek badi shakhsiyat ke taur par saamne laa diya he
 One of his followers admitted, "most of the people involved in organizing these rallies are followers of Guruji
" " bhaiyyu maharaj ke kareebi logon kaa kahana he ki unki mahatvakanksha maratha uthal-puthal ko ek mul andolan main badalane kii he
 Meanwhile, Sambhaji Raje, a descendant of Shivaji, kept his silence, which the BJP nominated for the Rajya Sabha in June
 2011 main maratha sanghathanon ne unhen aarakshan ke mudde par apana netaa ghoshit kiya tha
 It is believed that he is in a religious dilemma due to his proximity with the BJP
 raaje kehete hai, ''ye virodh pradarshan maraathon or daliton ke bich gaiyr-barabari kaa nateeja hai
 This will end only when the Marathas get reservation
 koprdi kii ghatana gusse ko jaahir karne kii vajah ban gai he
 But at the same time, the younger generation of Marathas know that their leaders are using it for their own political gains
 " maraathon kii aarakshan kii maang nai nahin he, par ek khaufnak jurm ne is samudaay ko harakat main laa diya he or is harakat kii shakl aane vaale hafton main or zyada saaf hogi

 abhi kuch arsa pehle tak mahendra singh dhoni hona kaaphi santoshjanak baat rahi hogi
 His Indian team continued to top the world test rankings
 april main unki shandaar pari ne is peedi main pehali baar vishwacap main jeet dilwaai thi
 And under his captaincy in May, Chennai Super Kings won the IPL title for the second time in a row
 yahaan england main, ham maanate hai ki ham shoharat ke aadi ho chuke hai, lekin dhoni kii damadari or bahut jaahir-si style se mugdh na ho paanaa hamen mushkil lagata he
 This halo of invincibility made the tragic start of India's tour of England even more unexpected
 parasmani jaisi shakti vaala yah shaks achaanak hi kuch bhi sahi nahin kar sakaa
 In retrospect, it appears that he was among the wrong team picks for Lord's and after winning the toss, he made a lot of mistakes (after all he proved to be the first captain in India in five years who lost the match after taking the first fielding)
 And later he made a ruckus of laughable pretensions as to why his team lost
 inamen se kisi bhi vajah main is tathy par roshni nahin daali gai ki england kii jis anushaasit or acchhee tarah taiyaar team ne unhen khel ke puure 30 ghanton tak daudaaye rakhaa, usase unke kai khilaadi maansik taur par mukaable kaa madda nahin rakhte the
 Perhaps Dhoni was oblivious to exposing these weaknesses, after all he was out in the final afternoon - the incident, after which the white flag of surrender was waved, the initial five wickets collapsed in 67 balls, which made tremendous Wrote the necklace of defeat
 shaayad cricket ke arddh-devtaa kii dhoni kii chhavi kii vajah se hi match referi ranjan mudugale ek baar phir bharatiyon kii sust over gati ke liye dhoni ko nilambit karke ek or apmanjanak sthiti main nahin le laae
 Before the start of the first Test, the match was expected to be loudly compared to the one-off match and the 2005 series match for the Ashes, but after that the comparison between the two might be that Ricky Ponting The Australians also gave themselves the ax at the feet, having lost the match at the hands of Bangladesh in Cardiff in which Andrew Symonds played as if someone was drinking overnight Area after faltering
 11 shrinkhalaaon tak avijit rahane ke record ke saath england aae bharat ke itani buree tarah chhitara jane kii vajahen kaaphi mushkil dikhti hai, lekin har kisi ke paas apni daleelein hai
 It is not that his defeat is a surprise to everyone
 chauthi pari main bharat kii ladkadaati ballebaaji kii chhavi sabko maaloom he or chennai main england or mohali main austrailia par jeet se usamen kharonch nahin ai he; yah baat bhi itani hi praasangik he ki capatoun or dominica main match drow karwaane ke liye unhen kitni takalif uthaani padi thi
 Rahul Dravid would have remained the wall in the early stages of the game, but at Lord's he once again showed that he could collapse under pressure in the near moments of defeat (his latest half-century in the fourth innings is dated 2006)
 iske baad tha bharat kaa shedul, jo angrejon ke hisaab se jarurat se zyada thakaaoo tha, or is haad-tod haalat ke bare main hamen bhi kuch baaten pataa hai
 The players who did not miss parts of the West Indies tour, have been playing continuously for months and must be tired
 or jo carabian daure ke samay baahar baithe the, unhen taiyaari ke liye summerset kii team ke khilaaf ek match ke baad ek baari-bharkam test match main dhakel diya gaya tha
 As most observers noticed, all the players who did not play in the Caribbean - Gautam Gambhir, Sachin Tendulkar and
 jahir khan-ne lords main nammaatr kaa hi yogadan diya
 what 
 jahir kaa thap ho janaa koi badakismati thi? agar aapane taunton main dekha ho, to aisa nahin tha, jahaan ve ajeeb-se lag rahe the, mote-se or unhone duusari pari main gendbaaji na karnaa hi pasand kiya
 if 
 jahir england ke khilaadi hote to unhen ek strenth or condishning course karaayaa jaataa, jisase ve zyada taiyaar hokar aate, badtar hokar nahin
 Dhoni and coach Duncan Fletcher should have seen this symptom in a bowler who has a history of injuries
 england main ek vichaar ke taur par ipiel kabhi bhi lokapriy nahin rahaa, kyonki yah hamaare gharelu sijan se takaraata he or ek aisi paison kii chadi najar aata he, jisase bhartiya board england or wales cricket board main apane samakahnon kii dhunaai kar saktaa he
 But now the time has come when Indians should drink some bitter medicine, IPL is destroying their best cricketers
 2008 main ipiel ke udai or bharat ke sheersh sitaron-khaskar tej gendbaajon ko chot lagane main badhotaree main sidhaa sambandh he
 And in this context the England team cannot rely on their luck that Virender Sehwag has not yet come because he has not fully recovered from the shoulder operation which should have happened immediately after Operation World Cup, but which It was apparently deferred at the behest of the Indian board so that they could play in the IPL
 summerset main apni shuruaati press conference main dhoni ne mana ki bharat kaa taqatvar madhya kram kis tarah apane aarambhik ballebaajon kii acchhee shuruyaat par nirbhar he
 But not only is Sehwag absent, but his regular starting partner Gambhir also played the IPL in a similar manner, which led to him resting in the West Indies tour
 iskaa matlab yah he ki gambhir jab taunton main aae, tab unhone 6 janvari ke baad se koi pratham shrenee match nahin khelaa tha
 Does India want to be World Test Champion or not? India also did not deal properly with Tendulkar's hundredth international century at the ground where he could not play well for his country before
 yah thik hi he ki dabaav kaa saamana kar sakane ke liye tendulkar ko salaam kiya jaataa he, lekin in halaat main jahaan nijee lakshyon ko samuhik lakshyon kii tulana main zyada prachaar miltaa he-ve bhi avash ho jate hai
 The same thing happened when he became the player to score the most centuries and score runs in Test cricket
 yah afsosna tha ki tendulkar kaa swasthya umdaa nahin tha, lekin is diggaj khilaadi ko gendbaaji karne kii chunauti par england khara utraa
 In both innings, England tried to dismiss him, and in the second innings he had to dismiss Tendulkar three times, as Andrew Strauss dropped his catch and was unceremoniously spared by umpire Billy Bowden
 Was
 agar sachin tendulkar ke shatak ko dekhne kii sambhaavna kaa maamla na hota, to kya itane saare bhartiya aakhri din match dekhne aate? or kya team ke liye yah ek acchhee baat he ki ek khilaadi ke irdagird itnaa baari prabhamandal ban jaae? england ke saath aisi koi samasya nahin he
 Emotionally and on-the-ground implementation, England is now a team that works together
 yahaan tak ki ek samay superstar rahe kevin petersan ko bhi baaki logon main samaa liya gaya he
 Notorious for a slow start India can still recover, but it looks like a team whose best has passed, not the one that has yet to come
 lords main jab dhul chant chuki hogi, to yah mana ja sakegaa ki ham vishwa kii number ek test team ko dekh rahe the
 But that team was not from India

 The name of Uttar Pradesh Sainik School (lucknow), famous worldwide as the oldest Sainik School in the country, has been changed in the meantime
 ab ise captain manoj kumaar pandey uttar pradesh sainik skool ke naam se janaa jayega
 This Sainik School was established on 15 July 1960
 skool kaa sanchaalan uttar pradesh sarkaar or uttar pradesh sainik skool socity dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The school is funded by the Uttar Pradesh government
 is skool ko ab skool ke purv chaatr shahid captain manoj kumaar pandey ke naam par badla gaya he
 Captain Manoj Kumar Pandey was martyred in the 1999 Kargil War and was then awarded the Param Vir Chakra
 captain manoj pandey desh ke tamaam sainik skulon ke bich se pehle param vir chakra vijeta hai
 What does the school principal say? Principal of Uttar Pradesh Sainik School, Colonel Amit Chatterjee, on the exercise of changing the name of the school, says that it is a proposal of the Uttar Pradesh cabinet and he is with the proposal as the representative of the government
 ve sarkaar ke is nirnay se khush hai or skool ke naam main badlaav bhi kiya ja chukaa he
 On the question of private opinion, he says that as a government employee, his personal opinion does not matter
 haalanki, ve apni ore se jodate hai ki desh ke tamaam sainik skulon main se sabase puraane sainik skool hone or vahaan se padhakar nikle ek maatr paramveer chakra vijeta hone ke naate aisa kiya janaa jaruri pahal he
 No information to Old Boys Association
 
 
 gauratlab he ki uttar pradesh sainik skool main pard rahe or vahaan se pard kar nikle chaatro kaa ek samooh skool kii behatari ke liye lagaataar sakriy rahata he
 Retired Colonel Summer Vijay Singh, the current president of the association, says that he too had no initial knowledge about the decision
 unhen skool ke naam badalane kii baat kinhin duusare madhyamon se mili or uske baad unhone purv chaatro ke samooh main ise saajha kiya
 However, they say to avoid writing anything on this issue on their behalf
 yah baat jaanakar khushi hui
 
 
 When Manmohan Pandey, younger brother of Captain Manoj Kumar Pandey, was talked about in this regard, he called the change of name of the school a good and necessary initiative
 ve kehete hai ki yah sarkaar kaa nirnay he or iske bare main unhen adhik jaankaree nahin
 He says that being a brother and a citizen of the country, it is a matter of pride for him to do so
 kya kehete hai skool ke staff?uttar pradesh sainik skool ke head physical trainer mukut singh kehete hai ki skool ke teaching staff ko skool ke naam badalane ke bare main pehle se koi jaankaree nahin thi
 He too got this information through the newspaper
 haalanki, ve nijee taur par naam badalane kii kavayad se ittefaq nahin rakhte
 They say that it is not appropriate to change the name of the maternal body of any student or cadet
 ve kehete hai ki captain manoj pandey se bhi pehle desh ke liye shahid hone waalon kii lambii list he or skool main unke naam par koi na koi pratiyogita chal hi rahi he
 For example, a debate competition is organized in the name of Captain Sunil Chandra
 vahiin captain manoj pandey ke naam par bhi beete kai varshon se skool main footbal toornament kaa aayojan kiya ja rahaa he
 Strange as a cadet
 
 
 uttar pradesh sainik skool ke purv chaatr or captain manoj kumaar pandey par 'hero of batalik' naam se kitaab likhane vaale unke ghanishthatam mitra pawan mishra skool kaa naam badale jane ke sawaal par kehete hai ki ek cadet ke taur unke liye bhi yah baat ajeeb lagi
 However, they say to give their cent percent in any campaign started in the name of Captain Manoj Pandey
 skool ke purv chaatro asantosh
 
 
 The change of name of Uttar Pradesh Sainik School is unacceptable to most of the students who came out of school
 ve is masale par alag-alag madhyamon se apana virodh darj kara rahe hai
 Pradeep Rai, an alumnus of the school and currently an employee of the Reserve Bank of India, says that no person is above any particular institution
 aisa karnaa skool ke hajaaron purv chaatro kii bhaawanaaon kaa dohan he
 It is also said that if Captain Manoj Pandey himself were alive today, then his attitude towards this political great would also be similar
 aisa kiya janaa sweekaarya nahin
 
 
 Amit Jaiswal, an alumnus of the school and a longtime employee of the Old Boys Association, is in complete opposition to the decision
 ve kehete hai ki skool kii sthapana ke itane saalon ke baad aisa kiya janaa kahin se bhi sweekaarya nahin he
 However, they talk about taking the parents of Captain Manoj Kumar Pandey into confidence
 unhone is maamle main artiai bhi file kii he or ve kanoonee tauratreekon se badhane kii baat kehete hai
 Along with this, they also mention the intention and opposition behind changing the name of King George Medical College, Lucknow
 sarkaar ek taraf mahangaai badha rahi he duusari ore congress netaa chaahate hai ki aane vaala bajet loklubhaavan ho
 He will give suggestions to Finance Minister p Chidambaram regarding this
 agle loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte hue congress netaa aisa bajet chaahate hai jisase mahangaai kii maar se pareshaan janata ko raahat mili or party ko chunaav main iskaa faaydaa mili
 Congress leaders can ask the Finance Minister to increase the income tax exemption limit, provide house for all and funds in poverty removal scheme
 chidambaram 14 farvari ko congress mukhyalay jaaenge, tabhi bajet ko lekar party netaaon se unki baat hogi

 aise main bhatta apane ek jaanane vaale ke jariye surat ke vyapaaree kirit paldia ke sampark main aayaa
 Paladiya advised Bhatt to invest money in bitcoins

 bhatta kaa kahana he ki sunil nair ko angadia ke jariye 5 karod rupaya diya gaya
 Bhatt was then released
 bhatta kaa kahana he ki koi doosraa adhikari pareshaan naa kare isliye wo sunil nair ke paas enosi lene gaya to nair ne use enosi nahin di
 But then another incident happened

 This story is about a strange university in the country, which has had three chancellors so far
 lekin vidambnaa he ki teenon hi ek-duusare par santhaan ko biimaar banane kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 Mahatma Gandhi International Hindi University, Wardha's first vice-chancellor and scholarly litterateur Ashok Vajpayee alleges, "the second vice-chancellor, instead of pursuing the work that started in my time
 gopinathan ne band karne main apana samay lagaaya
 "but IPS by profession and hobbyist litterateur is the head of Vajpayee who is the victim of falling behind the current Vice Chancellor Vibhuti Narayan Rai University
 cheharaa pahachaanen, jeeten inam
 To participate, says Click, "vajpayee lost five years in land acquisition and could not get an appointment even for an academic staff because he never used to go to Wardha
" jisase ham pichad gaye
 "rai himself has even started saying," There should be a debate in the literary world, why not stop this university
 ''mahatma gandhi ke sapanom ko saakaar karne ko bana desh kaa ekmaatr hindi vivi apane kulapatiyon kii manamaani kii vajah se hi aaj badahaal he
 Vajpayee tried to run the institute by staying in Delhi, then Gopinathan went to Wardha and got involved in controversies
 ab tisare kulapati raay ke vakt to kaalpanik padon par nishchit vetan ke saath niyuktiyon kii bharmaar ho gai he
 If Vajpayee failed to make educational appointments, Gopinathan made 11 illegal appointments, Rai also made seven illegal appointments
 jisaki vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog (ujisi) or mantralay bhi pushti karata he
 It is said that even today, if there is a special choice of opinion, then without the approval of the UGC, it gets the desired salary and position
 vivi ke 14 saal ke itihaas main imaaraten or chatravaas bane hai, lekin saal bhar ke bheetar hi kai nai imaaraten khastahal ho gayi
 Rai gave the construction contracts, especially to the UP Samaj Kalyan Nirman Nigam, against whom corruption cases are pending in the courts

" chaatro ke bich raay kotwaal kahkar pukaare jate hai
 Utpal Kant Anees, a recently expelled student, says, "rai drives Vivi in the same manner as a snobbish, where the bowers get bread and the stickers are beheaded
 ''gandhi kii karmasthali wardha main 1997 main sthapit yah santhaan vittiya aniyamitata, bhai-bhatijawad, yon utpeedan or jatvaad kii vajah se vivaadon kaa centre ban gaya he
 Till now it has almost 200 crores
 kharch ho chuke hai
 In the Ninth five-year Plan, the university was allocated Rs 18 crore for planned expenditure
 main se vaajapeyi ne sirf chah karod 40 lakh ru
 Only spent
 dasvin yojana main aavantit 41 karod, 91 lakh ru

 Then Rs 66 crore in the 11th plan

 An additional allocation of Rs
 '' iske alaava gaiyr-yojanagat kharch ke liye alag se aavanton hota he
 But despite this expense, the condition of this university is in disarray
 jabaki hindi ke saath hi urdu ke liye hyderabad main bana moulana aaazaad rashtriya vivi vikaas ke maamle main is vivi ko ek dashak peeche chodta dikh rahaa he
 But Rai's annoyance grows on this comparison and he says, "urdu is a language smaller than Hindi, but why its budget is higher
 vishwa hindi sammelan videsh mantralay kyon karaata he, jise hindi kii samaj nahin he
 "vice Chancellor Rai objected to the higher budget of Urdu, he wants to organize Hindi conference in his hand and shows special interest in giving character certificates to women writers
" pichley dinon unhen mahila lekhikaon ke khilaaf apni ek abhadra tippanee ke liye maafee mangakar apni kursi bachaani padi thi
 But he is not interested in correcting the mistakes of the university

 The chinlock episode was my stupidity
 '' lekin agle hi pal ve chunauti dete hai, ''agar meri ore se kiye gaye kaam avaidh hai, to log court jaaen
 "due to such arbitrary arbitrations, in this 14-year journey, this university has nothing but decaying new buildings in the name of achievements, but the list of controversies is so long that a series of novels can be prepared
" isse vivi ko aaj antarrashtriya str par to dur, desh ke sahitya jagat main bhi mukammal jagah nahin mil pai he
 Vajpayee says, "this international university has become truly zonal today
 '' lekin raay kehete hai, ''vaajapeyi ne ise macmillan house banane kii koshish kii, to gopinathan ne academik gatividhiyon kaa centre
 Hence it has become a routine university
 ''haal hi main republican party of india ke vidarrbha sachiv ashok meshram ne pradhanmantri, raashtrapati, maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri, ujisi or pramukh rajnatik dalon ke netaaon ko chitthee likhi he, jisamen raay par avaidh niyukti karne, ghotaale, avaidh degree aavanton or apane pasandida logon ko phayda pahunchane ke liye namakan ke niyam badalane ke aarope hai
 Following this complaint, the Prime Minister's Office and the President's Secretariat have sought an explanation from the Ministry of Human Resource Development and the Ministry has summoned the reply through a letter dated 12 August

 vivi kii durdasha or kulapatiyon kii nirankushta kii jaankaree ke baavjood mantralay or ujisi kumbhakarni neend so rahe hai
 The UGC and the ministry also consider 18 appointments illegal in documents obtained under the Right to Information Act
 lekin inhen abhi tak yah daleel dete hue mantralay ne radd nahin karaayaa he ki isse mukademebaaji badhegi
 Now Rai says, "if the Ministry orders, i will cancel these appointments
 '' adhikansh niyuktiyon ko yaa to kaary parishad kii manjuuri nahin mili he, to kuch main visitor nomini ne asahmati note laga rakhaa he
 In some appointments, even the minimum qualification has been ignored
 haalanki raay kisi bhi niyukti ko avaidh nahin maanate
 On the other hand, no official is willing to speak to the Ministry on these matters
 unki daleel he ki mantralay kaa kaam sirf fund muhaiyaa karana he, nigaraanee kaa kaam ujisi kaa he

 ve kehete hai, ''agar kisi pad par niyukti kii prakriya shuru ho chuki ho, to vah lapsad nahin hota
 "some reserved category posts are also filled with general quota
 raay par bhai-bhatijawad kaa bhi aarope he
 In the university, Professor Anil Ankit Rai, who is believed to be a relative of the patriarch, is accused of copying and writing a stolen book

 harvard lau skool ke professor david bi wilkins ne kaha ki bharat main vakaalat or vidhi shiksha ke pramukh kendron main se ek banane kii kshamta he
 Therefore, Indian lawyers need not be afraid of competition from other lawyers in the world at home and abroad too
 o pi jindal global uniwarsity main dikshant samaaroh main bhaashan dene aae harvard lau skool ke up dean wilkins ne kaha ki bharat main vanijyik vidhi peshey ke vikaas ke liye niamkeey avrodh ek seemaa tak jaruri hai, lekin aisi paabandiyon se videshi vakeelon ko lambey samay tak pratispardhaa se dur rakhaa ja saktaa he aisa maananaa galat hoga
 He said, "foreign lawyers have already made meaningful inroads into India's legal domain with the 'come and go' policy (temporarily come and go) and technology will further develop it
 pratispardhaa kaa saamana karnaa bhartiya vakeelon ke liye bhi laabhadaayak hoga
 Especially in the last year, there has been a meaningful development of Indian law companies
 ''wilkins ne kaha ki vidhi bazaar ko udaar banane ko lekar bhartiya vakeelon kii chintaa sambhavat: atishyoktipurna he
 He said, "it is unlikely that many legal services companies would like to open their offices in India and those who do so will only advocate in commercial law
" '' wilkins ne kaha ki videshi vakeelon ko bhartiya adaalaton ke samaksh upasthit hone par bahut kam phayda hoga or jo pesh honge unhen bhi sabit karnaa hoga ki unhen bhartiya kanoon or prakriya kii paryaapt jaankaree he
 In important cases before the Supreme Court of India, hardly any foreign or domestic petitioner should appoint any foreign lawyer in front of experienced lawyers Fali Nariman, Harish Salve, Kapil Sibal, Gopal Subrahmanyam and Abhishek Manu Singhvi
 '' The law professor further said that Indian lawyers will eventually learn more from their foreign counterparts by opening the Indian law market
 vahiin bhartiya vakeelon ko desh main hi rahane par adhik protsaahan milegaa
 "many talented Indian lawyers are leaving the country to look for opportunities in Singapore, London, and New York-based foreign law firms," wilkins said
 isse kahin behatar hoga ki ye yuvak evam yuvati desh main hi rahakar bhartiya vakil samudaay ko or behatar banaaen
 However, he said that to get this benefit, India would have to invest more to update legal education and improve quality
 wilkins ne apni haalia kitaab ‘ da indian legal profeshan in da age of globaligeshan : da rij of da corporate legal sector and its impact on da loyrs and sosayadi'' main kaha tha ki bharat ke chuninda rashtriya vidhi skool or anya sthapit santhaan jaise dilli vishvavidhyalay or kuch nijee santhaan jaise jindal global lau skool chaatro ko utkrisht vidhi shiksha de rahe hai
 But these institutions are educating only a small section of Indian lawyers
 unhone kaha, ‘‘bharat ke anya 1600 se adhik vidhi santhaan aisi shiksha muhaiyaa nahin karaate
 Therefore, India needs to improve the quality of education in these law schools
 agar yah hota he to aisa koi lakshya nahin hoga jo bhartiya vakil hasil nahin kar sakate

 For the last 14 years, our camera man, Tariq Lone's family, who has taken every beautiful and ugly pictures of the land, has not been able to find any news
 aakhri baatcheet main unke bhai ne shikara maanga tha
 But he could not send
 bhejte bhi kaise
 Shikara loves walking on Dal Lake
 laal chowk ke uske makaan kii duusari manzil par nahin
 Tariq is still performing his duty by reporting doom in paradise
 bhai-bhabhi or bachche kis haal main hai, kahaan hai, philhal kuch pataa nahin
 What a flood it is, who has made everything watery, and what a flood it is, who does not know how many eyes got water
 is sailaab kaa pani to ek roj utar jayega
 But what about those eyes that will cry whenever they cry? dekhte hi dekhte sab kuch ujaad gaya
 There are so many stories of pain, of fear, of neglect, and of every story with an endless flood of tears, more than those who have been ruined or died in this catastrophe, whose condition is worse than death
 kuch ke paas fate-puraane khwaab batch gaye hai to na jane kitne aise hai jinke paas koi khwaab bhi nahin he
 The glass of life is suddenly broken
 tukade chaaron taraf bikhare pade hai
 Each piece has become a tale of loneliness
 sab pani pani ho gaya
 Home-street, locality, hotel, inn, lodge, roads, shops, that is, the life of which helps to see the nature closely
 wo saare sahare pani-pani ho gayi
 All those who were living in paradise and are still alive today are in awe of what has happened suddenly? This catastrophe, this ruin, this chaos, this mourning, this screaming, this tear, this helplessness and This scene of death
 or phir usee maut ke guzar jane ke baad zindaa rahane ke liye jindagi se jang kii ye tasviren
 Wherever you look, there is devastation, destruction and destruction all around
 kahin tahas-nahas gali-mohalle, kahin matiamet ghar-chaubaare, kahin nadiyon main samaai sadaken, to kahin jagah-jagah bikhri laashen
 When ghounde collapses like cards
 or jab ilaake ke ilaake kabristaan main tabdeel ho jate hai manjilon tak pahunchane vaale raste jab khud hi mit jate hai tab sirf ek hi manzar bachataa he
 The scene of destruction, the scene of pain, the path of recklessness and helplessness

 Ask what happens to them when life is found by sitting among the corpses

 So imagine how long it would have taken to settle the entire colony? We cannot show you how and how long a township settles, but how can a whole colony be destroyed and how long it can be ruined, how can we eradicate that slum

 We all know that Shah Rukh Khan's sense of humor has always been overwhelming in the Bollywood industry
 is maamle main wo apane doston kii taang khinchne main kabhi nahin hichkichaate

 hanging my clueless head in shame xxrep 4 ! — Karan Johar (@karanjohar)july 13, 2014 After the tremendous defeat at the hands of India in the second Test of the current border-gavaskar series, Australia has set an unsolicited record
 ab kangaroo team bharat main sabase zyada test ganvaane vaali videshi team ban gai he
 It was his 20th Test defeat on Indian soil in Bangalore
 is lihaaj se usne england ko peeche choda, jise yahaan 19 test maichon main bharat ne maat di he
 In the 61-year (1956–2017) cricket history in India, Australia has played 48 Tests so far
 jisamen se use 20 test main haar, 13 main jeet mili, jabaki 14 mukaable drow rahe or ek match taai rahaa
 Foreign team's defeat in India Australia - 20 England - 19 New Zealand - 16 West Indies - 11 Sri Lanka - 10 himachal pradesh vidhansabha chunaav kii siyaasi jang jeetne nikali bijepi ne prem kumaar dhumal ko apana senapati niyukt kar diya he
 Dhumal's announcement has shocked political pundits
 isaki vajah he unki umr
 Former Chief Minister and veteran BJP veteran has completed 73 years of his age
 loksabhaa chunaav jeetne ke baad bijepi ne apane 75 saal puure kar chuke netaaon ko ritair kar diya tha
 In such a situation, questions are being raised by the announcement of Dhumal's name, whether it is bjp's opportunism or if she will win the election, she will keep Dhumal in the post of CM only for two years and after the completion of 75 years, a new leader will be given the responsibility of Himachal
 BJP in Himachal had many faces worthy of becoming CM candidate, leaders like JP Nadda can be named in it but it is believed that given the caste equations of the state
 a BJP played the stakes once again Dhumal
 himachal kaa chunavi itihaas dekhen to ek baar congress or ek baar bijepi kii sarkaar yahaan banati rahi he
 This time it is bjp's turn
 isliye wo koi mauka haath se jane dena nahin chaahati
 This is the reason why in the announcement of Dhumal's name, he also put aside his 75 years promise principle
 prem singh dhumal kii umr philhal 73 saal he or apana paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa hone tak ve 78 saal ke ho jaaenge
 This is where the screw is
 bijepi agar 75 saal vaale apane siddhant par kaayam rahati he to dhumal keval 2 saal ke liye siem rahenge
 He may then have to leave the Chief Minister's chair
 lekin agar bijepi ne dhumal ko puure 5 saal ke liye siem banane kaa faisla kiya he to ye uskaa raajnneetik avasarwaad hi kaha jayega
 Due to 75 years, many ministers had to leave
 Let us know that when Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister in 2014, he had set the age limit of BJP leaders to become ministers for 75 years
 yahi vajah rahi ki 2014 main chunaav jeetne ke baavjood laalkrishna adwani, murali manohar joshi jaise netaa centre main mantri nahin ban paae
 Apart from this, ministers whose age was 75 years also had to leave the ministerial post in the middle
 inamen najma hepatulla or calraj mishra shaamil hai
 The impact of this 75-year formula of the BJP was also seen in many states
 madhyapradesh main mantri babu laal gaur ko pad chhodana padaa tha
 Gujarat Chief Minister Anandi Ben Patel also had to leave the chair due to this rule of 75 years
 yahi vajah he ki dhumal ke naam kaa elaan chaunkaa rahaa he vahiin kuch jaankaar ye bhi maan rahe he ki dhumal par bijepi ne chunaav jitaane ke liye daanv khelaa he or ho saktaa he ki do saal baad unhen hataakar kisi or netaa kii tajposhi kar di jaae

 In the politics of Charanala, there is a lot of discussion about Chautala's future with INLD candidate, who revolted with grandparents and won all the seats
 in teen laal main se ek laal choudharidevilalki siyaasi viraasat ko lekar purv mukhyamantri omprakash chautaala ke beton main hi jang chhid gai
 Chautala's legacy is in the hands of the younger son Abhay Chautala, commanded by the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD)
 vahiin party se nikaal die jane ke baad jananaayak janata party banaakar siyaasi akhaade main utre chautaala parivaar ke dushyant kii nai naveli party jejepi ne 10 siten jeetin
 With this election result, Dushyant has proved that he is the rightful heir to the political legacy of the Chautala family, denying the grandfather and uncle's decision
 gauratlab he ki dushyant chautaala ne pradesh kii sabhi siton par apane ummidavaar utaare the
 Dushyant revolted Jinomprakash Chautala and Abhay Chautala and landed his warlords in the electoral battle, did not take his name during the entire campaign and made the name of his great-grandfather Chaudhary Devi Lal the helm of his election boat
 india today exis maay india ke agsit pole main dushyant kii party ko 6 se 10 siten milane kaa anumaan jataayaa gaya tha or jab nattejey aae, to vah bhi isi ke ird-gird rahe
 Chautala's party in crisis: This performance of Dushyant's party has been threatening to become the Chaudhary of Haryana's politics
 pehle hi kai netaaon ne sattadhari dal kaa rukh kar liya to vahiin kaiyon ne dushyant kaa daaman tham liya
 Now, while Inelokhata is also struggling to open, the existence of the party and the political career of Chautala father-son are also being questioned
 gauratlab he ki thik isi tarah viraasat kii jang jitkar 32 saal pehle taaoo devilal kii viraasat par kabja kar omprakash chautaala ne mukhyamantri pad tak kaa safar tay kiya tha
 When the success of Devi Lal sparked the rise in the politics of noise, Chaudhary gave a distinct identity to Devi Lal's political standing after the 1987 assembly elections
 tab devilal kii party kii safalataa ne siyaasi halkon main shor machaa diya tha
 Devi Lal's party had then won 85 of the 90 seats, and despite all the siege, the opposition continued to melt
 parinaam yah hua ki do baar mukhyamantri rahe devilal ko dilli kii gaddi par bataur pradhanmantri kabiz hone ke liye chunaa gaya, lekin unhone iske liye veepi singh kaa naam prastaavit kar diya tha
 He also served as the Home Minister in the Union Cabinet
