 The Bharatiya Janata Party will get maximum seats so far in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 yah baat ek nijee tivi channel ke surveykshan se saamne ai he
 According to him, if elections are held now, the Congress will go to its lowest ever
 survey ke mutabik lok sabha chunaav main haalanki bijepi sabase zyada siten laaegi, lekin endie tab bhi bahumat se dur rahegaa
 According to this survey report released on Thursday, BJP is expected to get 202 seats in Lok Sabha elections and its supporters can get 25 seats
 kul milakar endie ko 227 siten milengi
 In contrast, the Congress can get only 89 seats, which will be its minimum
 uske sahyogi dalon ko 12 siten milengi or vah mushkil se 100 kaa aankada paar kar paaegi
 The survey also stated that other parties can win 215 seats and many of them have joined hands with the BJP earlier
 isse narendra modi ke samarthak khush ho sakate hai
 It is believed that NDA will get 36 percent of the total vote percentage, while UPA will get 22 percent and others 42 percent
 jahaan congress ko 2009 main 206 siten mili thim vahiin is baar use mahaj 89 siten milane kii sambhaavna kaa kaaran yah he ki puure desh main party ke pradarshan main giravat dekhne main aa rahi he
 For example, in Andhra Pradesh, where the party had a great success last time and also got 33 seats, this time the party will get only 6 seats
 uttar pradesh main party ko sirf 4 siten hi milane kii sambhaavna he
 Last time, 21 mps came from there
 rajasthan main party ko pichhali baar kii 20 siton kii bajaay sirf 4 siten milengi
 Only Karnataka and Chhattisgarh are the states where the party is expected to do well
 karnataka se party ko 14 siten mil sakati hai jabaki pichhali baar sirf 6 siten mili thim
 Similarly, Congress can get 3 seats in Chhattisgarh while in Orissa it can get 7 seats as against 6 seats last time
 congress ke vipareet bijepi ke khate main badhotaree sabhi rajyon main dikh rahi he
 BJP will benefit the most in Uttar Pradesh where it can get 34 seats
 pichhali baar use yahaan 10 siten mili thim
 It will get 21 seats in Rajasthan as compared to 4 seats last time
 aam aadmi party kaa pradarshanis baar aam aadmi party ke pradarshan par sabhi kii nazren rahengi
 According to the survey, he can get 7 seats
 isamen se chaar siten sirf dilli se hi milengi
 As far as vote share is concerned, it can get up to 8 percent of the total vote
 yah pratishat congress or bijepi ko chhodkar kisi bhi anya party se zyada rahegaa
 JD (U) in Bihar will find it costlier for Nitish Babu to separate from BJP in Jhakabihar
 vahaan bijepi ko 21 siten mil sakati hai jabaki pichhali baar 12 siten mili thim
 Nitish Babu's party JD (U) is in all probability to be clean and he may have to settle for just 5 seats
 inkaa bhi rahegaa jalawaavo partiyaan jo na to congress ke saath hai or na hi bijepi ke saath, unhen kaaphi siten milengi
 For example, AIADMK and Left parties can get 27-27 seats while Mamata's party Trinamool can get 24 seats, BSP 21 and SP 20 seats
 ye bhi kam nahimbijapi ke alaava jin partiyon kaa pradarshan behatar rahegaa unamem annadramuk bhi he jiske saansadon kii sankhya 9 se badhkar 27 ho sakati he
 The YSR Congress can get 13 seats as compared to the previous one
 tiares ko 10 siten mil sakati hai jabaki pichhali baar use 2 siten hi mili thim
 Similarly, the Telugu Desam Party can also benefit

 After all, why do we join anyone? 
 
 ? kyon kisi se jindagibhar saath nibhaane kaa vaada karte hai? kyon usase bhi aisa hi koi vaada lete hai?khushiyon kii talash hi hamen kisi ke kareeb laati he
 We all look for someone in our life who loves us from the bottom of our heart
 hamaari parvaah kare
 Think for us lekin kai baar hamaara rishta us tarah se aage nahin bad paata he jaisaa ham sochate hai
 Relationships start becoming a burden due to fights and estrangement
 baavjood iske zyaadataraladakiyaan is rishte se alag hone ke bajaay ise dhoti rahati hanore aisa karne ke peeche unke paas tamaam vajahen bhi hoti hai
 These are the reasons
 
 
 1
 On most occasions girls carry on such a relationship because they feel that this man is their first love and they cannot leave their first love in any condition
 darasal, wo is rishte ko is kadar apane andar basaa chuki hoti hai ki unhen alag hone se dar lagane lagata he or wo is boj ko dhone main hi comfortable ho jaati hai
 2
 kai baar ladkiyaan aise rishte ko ye sochakar dhoti hai ki ek na ek din to sabakuch thik ho hi jayega
 They feel that if she stays calm now everything will be alright
 3
 On many occasions girls feel that it is not right to leave anyone in spite of a million evil
 unke saamne insaaniyat kaa sawaal khadaa ho jaataa he or wo alag nahin ho paati hai
 4
 zyaadaatar ladkiyaan sochati hai ki is rishte ko aage badhaane ke liye unhone bahut kuch invest kiya he
 In such a situation, it is not sensible to come so far and retreat
 yahi soch unhen is kadave rishte se nikalne nahindeti he
 5
 logon kii soch kaa dar ek bahut badi vajah he jiske chalate ek ladki relationships main sau buraaiyon ke baavjood ladke se alag nahin ho paati he
 Leaders are suspected to be involved in the Bihar Staff Selection Commission scam
 is puure maamle main ab tak 8 logon kii giraftaar ho chuki he, jisamen ayog ke sachiv parameshwar ram or ek nijee skool ke diarector ramashish singh shaamil he
 Photo of Manjhi with scam accused In the meantime, a picture of former Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has been revealed, in which he is seen with Ramashish Singh, accused in this scam
 police ke mutabik, karodon keghotalemen ramashish singh kii bhi bhoomika he, jiske kaaran unako guuruuvaar kii shaam ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Ramashish Singh is accused of writing the question paper of the Staff Selection Commission examination from his AVN school
 gauratlab he ki AVN skool bhi parikshaarthiyon ke liye ek pariksha centre tha or pariksha shuru hone se aadhe ghante pehle hi yahaan se paper li kar diya gaya tha
 Manjhi gave this clarification, however, in a conversation with his picture till date, former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi said that he does not know Ramashish Singh
 maanjhi ne kaha ki saikadon log unase rojaanaa milte hai or tasviren khinchvaate hai or jo tasviir saamne ai he usee kaa hissaa he
 Just the small fish caught in the scam, let us know that the examination of the Staff Selection Commission was to be held in 4 stages, out of which the paper leak incident occurred in the first two phases, after which the Bihar government has canceled the entire examination
 sutron ke mutabik ab tak jin logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he, vah sirf choti machhliyaan he or bade rajanetaaon ke bhi shaamil hone kii sambhaavna he

 com / en1zl7igze bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne apane do sahyogi dalon argedy or congress kii aalochanaon ke baavjood yah saaf kar diya he ki raashtrapati pad ke chunaav main vah pratidwandvi bijepi ke ummidavaar kaa samarthan karegi
 Nitish went against the bjp's proposal to field a joint opposition candidate against the BJP candidate, declaring that his party would support Ramnath Kovind in the JDU presidential election, which held the post of Governor of Bihar till last week
 bihar kii mahagathbandhan sarkaar main jediu kii sahyogi partiyon - congress or lalu prasad yadav kii argedy ne ise lekar saaf taur par apni nakhushi jaahir kii
 Lalu even termed Nitish's decision as a 'historic mistake'
 lekin apni aalochanaon ko darkinar karte hue nitish ne saaf kar diya ki vah apane faisle par kaayam hai
 He said, the Grand Alliance is confined to Bihar, so its constituents are free to decide their (separate) stand on national issues
 nitish kumaar darasal congress ke ek varisht netaa seepi joshi ke ek puraane bayaan kaa zikr kar rahe the
 CP Joshi made a similar statement before the 2015 Bihar assembly elections when he was asked how the three parties (congress, RJD and JDU) would be able to bypass their protests on important issues
 congress or argedy pramukh lalu yadav ne 17 july ko vam dalon ke saath milakar purv loksabhaa spikar mira kumaar ko raashtrapati pad ke liye vipaksh kaa ummidavaar banane ke vaaste apni partiyon samet 17 dalon ko manaane ke prastaav par kaam kiya tha
 However, the result was the cipher
 bijepi or iske sahyogi dalon ne kshetreey partiyon kaa samarthan hasil kar raashtrapati chunaav ke liye 63 fisadi voton kaa jugad kar liya he
 The picture became clearer after Nitish left the opposition
 nitish ne kovind ke samarthan kii vajah bataate hue kaha ki bihar ke rajyapal ke rup main unhone bina kisi pakshpaat ke kaam kiya
 He said that he is proud to support a person who has a deep connection with Bihar
 nitish kaa yah tark lalu ke us daleel ke jawaab main he, jisamen vah baar-baar mira kumaar ko 'bihar kii beti' bataate rahe hai
 Meira Kumar has been a five-time MP and is the daughter of former Deputy Prime Minister Jagjivan Ram
 kovind kii tarah vah bhi dalit hai, isi vajah se mayawati or sharad pavaar jaise vipakshi netaaon ne bijepi ummidavaar ko samarthan nahin diya
 On making Meira Kumar a candidate, Nitish said, 'has Bihar's daughter been chosen to lose?' He asked in question that whether this is the same strategy that the opposition will take for the 2019 elections
 haalanki nitish, congress or lalu sabhi ne jor dekar kaha he ki raashtrapati chunaav main takaraav kaa bihar main gathbandhan par asar nahin padane ja rahaa he
 Nitish Kumar broke a 17-year-old relationship with BJP in 2013 after Narendra Modi was declared the prime ministerial candidate
 lekin beete kuch samay se donon netaaon ne ek-duusare ke do sabase ahm faislon par apana samarthan vyakt kiya tha
 While PM Modi praised Nitish's decision to ban liquor in Bihar, Nitish openly supported the Prime Minister's decision of demonetisation
 ab nitish ne yah sanket de diya he ki vah piem modi se apane puraane bair ko bhula chuke hai
 He is not afraid of the anger of his allies
 agar nitish apane maujuuda saathiyon se rishta todane kaa faisla karte hai, to aisi sthiti main bijepi ke paas paryaapt vidhayak hai, jinke dam par vah mukhyamantri bane rah sakate hai
 In such a situation, it is clear that either Lalu or Congress will not want the end of the alliance
 bhrashtachar ke maamalon main lalu ke parivaar ke sadasyon (unke do bete bihar sarkaar main mantri hai) ke khilaaf jaanch chal rahi he or raajnneetik satta ke dam par unhen cese ladane main kuch to madad milegi
 At the same time, the Congress has only a few states where it is in power, so it will not want any state to be snatched away from its hands
 lalu ke bete or bihar ke upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne kaha he ki pehle se yah maan lenaa ki raashtrapati chunaav main vipaksh kii haar hogi, galat he
 He also said that the electoral battle is about ideology
 unhone apane pita ke rukh ko doharaate hue kaha ki bijepi ke 'fasiwad' ke khilaaf ladane ke liye vipakshi dalon ko aage aana jaruri he
 The comments haalanki nitish ke karibiyon kaa kahana he ki darasal yah lalu yadav or anya log hai, jo bijepi ke asli makasad ko samarthan de rahe hai
 It is further clarified that Meera Kumar is a Jatav Dalit, while Ramnath Kovind is a non-jatav Dalit
 yah wo tabaka he jise bijepi lubhaane main safal rahi he
 He says that the BJP has indicated that it is supporting a sub-group of Dalits who are inclined towards it, while the opposition has made a mistake by contesting from a competitive sub-caste
 beete shaam ko nitish kumaar ne lalu yadav dwaara yojit kii gai iftaar party main shirkat kii
 Both were seated side-by-side and both hugged before the Chief Minister left
 ho saktaa he yah raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar paidaa hui duuri ko kam karne kaa prayaas rahaa ho
 The RJD of Congress and Lalu Prasad Yadav, jdu's partner parties in Bihar's Grand Alliance government, expressed their unhappiness about this
 lalu ne to nitish ke faisle ko 'aitihaasik bhul' tak qaraar diya
 But bypassing his criticisms, Nitish made it clear that he stood by his decision
 unhone kaha, mahagathbandhan bihar tak hi simit he, isliye iske ghatak dal rashtriya muddon par apana (alag) stand tay karne ke liye swatantra hai
 Nitish Kumar was referring to an old statement by CP Joshi, a senior Congress leader
 2015 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle seepi joshi ne aisa hi bayaan diya tha, jab unase sawaal kiya gaya tha ki teenon dal (congress, argedy or jediu) ahm muddon par apane virodhon ko kaise darkinar kar paaenge
 On July 17, Congress and RJD chief Lalu Yadav worked with the Left parties on a proposal to convince 17 parties, including their own parties, to make former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar the opposition candidate for the presidency
 haalanki iskaa nateeja sifer hi rahaa
 The BJP and its allies have garnered 63 per cent of the votes for the presidential election by gaining the support of regional parties
 nitish ke vipaksh kaa saath chhodane ke baad tasviir or saaf ho gai
 Nitish cited the reason for Kovind's support as the Governor of Bihar and acted without bias
 unhone kaha ki ek aise vyakti kaa samarthan karne main unhen garv mahasoos ho rahaa he, jiskaa bihar se gaharaa naata rahaa he
 Nitish's argument is in response to Lalu's plea in which he has repeatedly called Meera Kumar as 'bihar's daughter'
 mira kumaar paanch baar saansad rah chuki hai or vah purv uppradhanmantri jagjivan ram kii beti hai
 Like Kovind, he too is a Dalit, which is why opposition leaders like Mayawati and Sharad Pawar did not support the BJP candidate
 nitish ne mira kumaar ko ummidavaar banaae jane par kaha, 'kya bihar kii beti ko haarane ke liye chunaa gaya he?' unhone sawalia lahaze main kaha ki kya yah vahi ranneeti he, jo vipaksh 2019 ke chunaavon ke liye akhriyaar karegaa
 However, Nitish, Congress and Lalu have all insisted that the presidential election clash is not going to affect the alliance in Bihar
 nitish kumaar ne saal 2013 main narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiye jane ke baad bijepi se 17 saal purana rishta tod liya tha
 But for some time, the two leaders have expressed their support on each other's two most important decisions
 piem modi ne bihar main sharabbandi ke nitish ke faisle kii saraahna kii to nitish ne pradhanmantri ke notebandi ke nirnay kaa khulkar samarthan kiya
 Now Nitish has indicated that he has forgotten his old hatred of PM Modi
 vah apane sahyogi dalon ke gusse se darane vaale nahin hai
 If Nitish decides to break the ties with his current allies, then in such a situation the BJP has enough mlas, on whose own strength he can remain the Chief Minister
 aisi sthiti main yah to saaf he ki lalu yaa congress donon main se koi bhi gathbandhan kaa ant nahin chahenge
 Investigations are going on against Lalu's family members (two of his sons are ministers in the Bihar government) in corruption cases and they will get some help in fighting the case on the basis of political power
 vahiin maujuuda samay main congress ke paas gine-chune hi rajya hai, jahaan vah satta main shaamil he, isliye vah nahin chaahegi ki uske haath se koi rajya chhin jaae
 Lalu's son and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav has said that it is wrong to assume in advance that the opposition will be defeated in the presidential election
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki chunavi ladaai vichaardhaara ko lekar he
 He reiterated his father's stance, saying that to fight against bjp's 'fascism', opposition parties must come forward
 tippaniyan However, Nitish's close people say that it is actually Lalu Yadav and others who are supporting the real cause of the BJP
 isko or adhik spasht karte hue kaha gaya he ki mira kumaar ek jatav dalit hai, jabaki ramnath kovind gaiyr-jatav dalit hai
 This is the section that BJP has succeeded in wooing
 unka kahana he ki bijepi ne is tarah sanket de diya he ki vah daliton ke ek up-samooh kaa samarthan kar rahi he, jiskaa jhukaav uski ore he, jabaki vipaksh ne pratispardhi up-jati se ummidavaar khadaa kar ek bhul kii he
 Last evening, Nitish Kumar attended an iftar party organized by Lalu Yadav
 donon agal- bagal hi baithe the or mukhyamantri ke vidaa hone se pehle donon gale bhi mili
 It may have been an attempt to reduce the distance created by the presidential election

 yah wo tabaka he jise bijepi lubhaane main safal rahi he
 He says that the BJP has indicated that it is supporting a sub-group of Dalits who are inclined towards it, while the opposition has made a mistake by contesting from a competitive sub-caste
 beete shaam ko nitish kumaar ne lalu yadav dwaara yojit kii gai iftaar party main shirkat kii
 Both were seated side-by-side and both hugged before the Chief Minister left
 ho saktaa he yah raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar paidaa hui duuri ko kam karne kaa prayaas rahaa ho
 On making Meira Kumar a candidate, Nitish said, 'has Bihar's daughter been chosen to lose?' He asked in question that whether this is the same strategy that the opposition will take for the 2019 elections
 haalanki nitish, congress or lalu sabhi ne jor dekar kaha he ki raashtrapati chunaav main takaraav kaa bihar main gathbandhan par asar nahin padane ja rahaa he
 Nitish Kumar broke a 17-year-old relationship with BJP in 2013 after Narendra Modi was declared the prime ministerial candidate
 lekin beete kuch samay se donon netaaon ne ek-duusare ke do sabase ahm faislon par apana samarthan vyakt kiya tha
 While PM Modi praised Nitish's decision to ban liquor in Bihar, Nitish openly supported the Prime Minister's decision of demonetisation
 ab nitish ne yah sanket de diya he ki vah piem modi se apane puraane bair ko bhula chuke hai
 He is not afraid of the anger of his allies
 agar nitish apane maujuuda saathiyon se rishta todane kaa faisla karte hai, to aisi sthiti main bijepi ke paas paryaapt vidhayak hai, jinke dam par vah mukhyamantri bane rah sakate hai
 In such a situation, it is clear that either Lalu or Congress will not want the end of the alliance
 bhrashtachar ke maamalon main lalu ke parivaar ke sadasyon (unke do bete bihar sarkaar main mantri hai) ke khilaaf jaanch chal rahi he or raajnneetik satta ke dam par unhen cese ladane main kuch to madad milegi
 At the same time, the Congress has only a few states where it is in power, so it will not want any state to be snatched away from its hands
 lalu ke bete or bihar ke upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne kaha he ki pehle se yah maan lenaa ki raashtrapati chunaav main vipaksh kii haar hogi, galat he
 He also said that the electoral battle is about ideology
 unhone apane pita ke rukh ko doharaate hue kaha ki bijepi ke 'fasiwad' ke khilaaf ladane ke liye vipakshi dalon ko aage aana jaruri he
 The comments haalanki nitish ke karibiyon kaa kahana he ki darasal yah lalu yadav or anya log hai, jo bijepi ke asli makasad ko samarthan de rahe hai

 Both were seated side-by-side and both hugged before the Chief Minister left
 ho saktaa he yah raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar paidaa hui duuri ko kam karne kaa prayaas rahaa ho
 However, Nitish, Congress and Lalu have all insisted that the presidential election clash is not going to affect the alliance in Bihar
 nitish kumaar ne saal 2013 main narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiye jane ke baad bijepi se 17 saal purana rishta tod liya tha
 But for some time, the two leaders have expressed their support on each other's two most important decisions
 piem modi ne bihar main sharabbandi ke nitish ke faisle kii saraahna kii to nitish ne pradhanmantri ke notebandi ke nirnay kaa khulkar samarthan kiya
 Now Nitish has indicated that he has forgotten his old hatred of PM Modi
 vah apane sahyogi dalon ke gusse se darane vaale nahin hai
 If Nitish decides to break the ties with his current allies, then in such a situation the BJP has enough mlas, on whose own strength he can remain the Chief Minister
 aisi sthiti main yah to saaf he ki lalu yaa congress donon main se koi bhi gathbandhan kaa ant nahin chahenge
 Investigations are going on against Lalu's family members (two of his sons are ministers in the Bihar government) in corruption cases and they will get some help in fighting the case on the basis of political power
 vahiin maujuuda samay main congress ke paas gine-chune hi rajya hai, jahaan vah satta main shaamil he, isliye vah nahin chaahegi ki uske haath se koi rajya chhin jaae
 Lalu's son and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav has said that it is wrong to assume in advance that the opposition will be defeated in the presidential election
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki chunavi ladaai vichaardhaara ko lekar he
 He reiterated his father's stance, saying that to fight against bjp's 'fascism', opposition parties must come forward
 tippaniyan However, Nitish's close people say that it is actually Lalu Yadav and others who are supporting the real cause of the BJP
 isko or adhik spasht karte hue kaha gaya he ki mira kumaar ek jatav dalit hai, jabaki ramnath kovind gaiyr-jatav dalit hai
 This is the section that BJP has succeeded in wooing
 unka kahana he ki bijepi ne is tarah sanket de diya he ki vah daliton ke ek up-samooh kaa samarthan kar rahi he, jiskaa jhukaav uski ore he, jabaki vipaksh ne pratispardhi up-jati se ummidavaar khadaa kar ek bhul kii he
 Last evening, Nitish Kumar attended an iftar party organized by Lalu Yadav
 donon agal- bagal hi baithe the or mukhyamantri ke vidaa hone se pehle donon gale bhi mili
 It may have been an attempt to reduce the distance created by the presidential election

 Where the opposition is uniting against Modi, the NDA allies are busy showing their eyes to the BJP
 shivasena ke baad jediu ke tevar bhi talkh ho gaye hai
 Realizing the fragility of the times, Nitish Kumar has placed such a condition in front of the BJP, which is impossible to fulfill
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaarake ghar par ravivaar ko jediu kor cameti kii baithak hui
 After this meeting, for the first time JDU gave its talk about seats
 jediu ne 2019 main 25 loksabhaa siton par chunaav ladane kii maang kii he jabaki bijepi ko mahaj 15 siten deni kii baat kahi
 Its JDU has decided that the face of the NDA alliance in the state will also be CM Nitish Kumar
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main modi lahar main bihar kii 40 loksabhaa siton main endie ne 31 siten jiti thi
 Out of the 31 seats of NDA, BJP had got 22 seats, Paswan's LJP got 6 seats and Upendra Kushwaha's RLSP got 3 seats

 But now BJP is no longer the Atal era
 bijepi agar nitish kumaar kii baat maanati he, to aisi haalat main apane 7 saansadon kii seat ko tyaag dena padegaa
 In such a situation, it is difficult to accept PM Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah on their terms
 bijepi bhi is baat ko bakhubi taur par nitish kumaar kii raajnneetik haalat ko samaj rahi he
 According to BJP sources, the party can leave only 10 to 15 seats for JDU
 kyonki baaki sahyogi dal bhi hai, jinke liye bhi siten chhodani hai
 However, NDA is scheduled to meet in Bihar on 7 June
 is baithak main agle loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaariyon or seat shering ko lekar charchaa hogi
 It is worth noting that when Narendra Modi was made the Prime Ministerial candidate of BJP in 2013, Nitish Kumar broke away from the NDA
 aise main bijepi ram vilaas paswan kii party or upendra kushvaha kii party se gathbandhan kar chunaav maidan main utari thi
 The result was that Nitish's party JDU was limited to 2 seats

 But Paswan and Kushwaha's party are partners in the central government

 This meeting is being linked to the developments happening in the politics of Bihar
 darasal pichley kuch dinon se paswan bhi nitish kumaar ke sur main sur milaate najar aa rahe hai
 It is believed that behind the exercise of these three parties and talc tweet, there may be an attempt to increase their power in seat sharing in the 2019 elections
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke purv adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne shanivaar ko kaha ki lagata he ki bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar pradhanmantri banane kaa sapana dekh rahe hai, or votbank kii raajnneeti main lipt hai

 Keshav Maurya said that in the 2014 Lok Sabha election in Phulpur Lok Sabha seat 53 out of 100 votes were received by BJP and 47 votes were received from all opposition parties including SP, BSP
 usee tarj par upachunaav main bhi hoga or nateeja bijepi ke paksh main hoga
 In the by-election, the SP-BSP alliance will blow, he said, to stop the victory chariot of Modi which the SP-BSP has formed
 upachunaav main hi isaki hawa nikal jaaegi
 BJP candidates will win both Phulpur and Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seats by a huge vote
 keshav ne kaha ki modi lahar abhi bhi kaayam he or 2019 main bhi rahegi
 Due to this fear, the entire opposition is coming together, but there is no benefit
 desh main modi ke vikaas ko janata sweekaar rahi he
 Keshav said Yogi, not my teacher, Keshav Prasad Maurya said what kind of estrangement is there between him and CM Yogi Adityanath
 ek siem or dipti siem ke bich jaisaa sambandh hona chahie hamaare bich vaisaa hi he
 Keshav said that Yogi would not be called a Guru but Yogi had a very good relationship between Guru Avaidyanath and our Guru Ashok Singhal

 Bharatiya Janata Party's firebrand leader and candidate from Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh Varun Gandhi has appealed to Muslim voters to vote
 varun gandhi ne ek chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki agar muslim matadaata unhen vot karte hai to unhen bahut acha legga
 If they do not vote for them, then the people of the Muslim community can go to them for work, they have no problem with this
 bataa den ki varun gandhi upi ke sultanpur se maujuuda saansad hai or ab is seat par unki maa menka gandhi chunaav lard rahi hai
 This is the reason why Varun Gandhi is contesting from his mother's seat Pilibhit
 varun gandhi ne chunavi sabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki 'bas main ek cheez muslim bhai ko bolnaa chahta hum ki agar aapane mujhe vot diya to mujhe bahut acha lagegaa agar aapane mujhe vot nahin diya, koi baat nahin, tab bhi mujhase kaam le lenaa
 There is no problem
 ' # WATCH bjp's Varun Gandhi in Pilibhit, earlier today: Bas mein ek cheez Muslim bhai ko bolna chahta hun ki agar aapne mujhe vote diya toh mujhe bahut accha lagega, agar aapne mujhe vote nahi diya, koi baat nahi, tab bhi mujh se kaam le le na, koi dikat ki baat nahi

 galat to nahin bolaa maine kuch
 Is some Muslim going to have sugar in my tea? aise main ek baat kahata hum main duniya ko hindu-muslim ke rup main nahin dekhtaa
 i see the world in two ways, myself and strangers
 ' bataa den ki varun gandhi kaa yah bayaan unki maa menka gandhi ke bayaan se thik ulat he
 In fact, Maneka Gandhi had asked the Muslim voters to vote for her in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections as the Muslims would need them after the election
 menka ne muslim bahul kshetra turabakhaani main yojit ek chunavi sabha main kaha ki main logon ke pyaar or sahyog se jeet rahi hum lekin agar meri yah jeet musalamaanon ke bina hogi to mujhe bahut acha nahin lagegaa
 The BJP leader said that i tell you so much that the heart turns sour
 phir jab musalmaan aata he kaam ke liye, phir mai sochati hum ki nahin rahane hi do kya fark padataa he
 After all, is the job also a bargain, is it right or not? ”in the year 2009, Varun Gandhi contested from Pilibhit on his mother's place in which he won
 2009 main hi varun gandhi vivaadit bayaan dekar bijepi ke fire brands netaa ke taur par ubhare the
 At the same time, in 2014, Varun Gandhi was given a ticket from Sultanpur by BJP, in which Varun Gandhi again won

 What can i do with someone? Tell me by court chidambaram ko 5 sitambar tak sibiai hiraasat main bheja gaya tha, jo aaj khatm ho rahi thi

 Has the Modi government banned cigarette, bidi, tobacco and alcohol consumption? If you believe a video viral on social media, then the government has taken this big step
 is viral ko khabar likhe jane tak ek lakh 90 hajaar se zyada vyuj mil chuke the
 An investigation by India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the video going viral is confusing
 video main kiya gaya modi sarkaar ke cigarette, sharaab or tambaakoo par bain lagane kaa daawa galat he
 The Indian government has banned e-cigarettes only
 utyub video kaa archivd varjanayahandekha ja saktaa he
 youtube channel "modi News" has around 3
 36 minute kaa yah video 28 sitambar ko aplod kiya he
 Its title reads: "stop smoking cigarettes all over India, Modi government made big decision: Now nobody will drink cigarettes
 " haalanki video ke neeche die gaye discripshan main keval i-cigarette par pratibandh kaa hi zikr kiya gaya he
 By the time the news was written, this video had received over one lakh 90 thousand views
 yah video fasebukapar bhi saajha kiya ja rahaa he
 a voiceover is heard in the video in which a person says, "the Modi government has banned cigarettes, bidis, tobacco and liquor all over India
 sarkaar ne inke utpaadan or bikri par puri tarah se bain lagane kaa faisla kiya he
 "when we searched on the Internet to know the truth of the claim being made in the video, it was found that on September 18, the Modi government has banned e-cigarettes across the country
 yah bain i-cigarette ke utpaadan or bikri par lagaaya gaya he
 Nirmala Sitharaman said that e-cigarette making, import / export, sale, distribution, store and advertisement will all be banned
 haalanki, yahaan yah spasht kar den ki yah bain keval i-cigarette par he, bidi, tambaakoo, cigarette va sharaab par nahin
 The cabinet decision on ban on e-cigarettes can be seen
 haalanki is bain ke baad kuch shaharon main virodh pradarshan hue, lekin sarkaar apane is faisle par you-turn lene ko taiyaar nahin he
 This news was prominently published by several reputed media institutes
 video main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki aap is bain kii soochna modi sarkaar kii aadhikarik website "http: / / www
 modi
 com" par dekh sakate hai
 However, when we gathered information about this website, we found that it is not the official website of the Modi government, but there is no content on this website
 haalanki, pradhanmantri narendra modi ne is baar apane radio sho "man kii baat" main i-cigarette par pratibandh kii jaankaree di thi
 There is much misinformation about e-cigarettes
 They are extremely harmful for health
 What is even worse is that unlike tobacco, where the hazards are known, in this case it is silent and equally lethal

 While on one hand this popular item song is being seen quite a lot by the people, on the other hand Tezaab film director N
 chandra or original gane kii koreographer saroj khan gane ke nae varjan se khush nahin hai
 Jacqueline's bold moves on the song 'ek Do Teen', see Baaghi 2's new song Taateab film director n Chandra, said in an interview that they could not have imagined that the song would be done like this
 unhen is baat kii bhi ummid nahin thi ki is gane ke liye jacleen ko chunaa jayega
 He further said that replacing Madhuri Dixit with Jacqueline is like turning Central Park into a Botanical Garden
 maadhuri kaa dance garimamayi tha or maasoomiyat se bharaa tha, jabaki ye dance 'sex act' he
 He also said that the song's choreographer Saroj Khan is also very disappointed with the song's recapitulation

 nirdeshak ramgopal verma phir aae hai, ek daraavnee film 'bhoot riterns' lekar, jisamen is baar bhoot se darate nazar aae manisha koirala, jedy chakravarti, madhushaalini or alaaena sharma
 
 
 This is the story of a haunted house, in which the whole family goes to live together
 
 
 or phir kya-kya hua hoga, aap khud samajhadaar hai
 
 
 The comments 'bhoot riterns' dedh ghante, yani 90 minute kii film he, or kareeb 50 minute tak film ke sabhi kirdaar bhoot ke saath luka-chhipi khelte dikhte hai
 
 
 i think, now all this should be reduced in horror films
 
 
 masalan, ek naukar, jo shaayad 'bees saal baad' se lekar ab tak kii lagbhag sabhi horer filmon main sabase pehle 'bali kaa bakra' banataa he
 
 
 Doors making creepy noises, and long scenes of finding ghosts, which happen anyway in a special appearance in any horror film, and just like our police arrives at last
 
 
 khayr, nirmaataa nitin manmohan kii is film kii sabase acchhee baat he isaki 3-di cinematography, jisaki badaulat aapako kai jagah kamaal ke 3-di effects dekhne ko milenge
 
 
 i will again say that the actors were just to be scared in the film, so it is useless to mention acting
 
 
 aakhir main yahi kahuunga ki behatar hoga ki ab raamu apni horer filmon main kuch kahaniyaan bhi daalana shuru karen
 
 
 So, my rating for 'bhoot Returns' of almost untitled story is 1
 5 star
 
 
 'bhoot Returns' is an hour and a half movie, ie 90 minutes, and for about 50 minutes all the characters of the film are seen playing hide and seek with the ghost
 
 
 mujhe to lagata he, ab horer filmon main yah sab kuch kam hona chahie
 
 
 For example, a servant who probably becomes the first 'bali ka Bakra' in almost all horror films from 'twenty years later' till now
 
 
 daraavnee awaazen nikaalte darvaaze, or bhoot ko dhundne ke lambe-lambe seens, jo vaise bhi kisi bhi horer film main special apiyarence main hota he, or hamaari police kii tarah aakhir main hi aata he
 
 
 Well, the best thing about producer Nitin Manmohan's film is its 3-D cinematography, due to which you will get to see amazing 3-D effects in many places
 
 
 main phir kahuunga ki actors ko film main sirf darana tha, so, acting kaa zikr karnaa bhi bekaar he
 
 
 In the end, it would be better to say that now Ramu starts putting some stories in his horror films
 
 
 so, lagbhag bina kahani kii 'bhoot riterns' ke liye meri reating he 1
 5 stars
 
 
 khayr, nirmaataa nitin manmohan kii is film kii sabase acchhee baat he isaki 3-di cinematography, jisaki badaulat aapako kai jagah kamaal ke 3-di effects dekhne ko milenge
 
 
 i will again say that the actors were just to be scared in the film, so it is useless to mention acting
 
 
 aakhir main yahi kahuunga ki behatar hoga ki ab raamu apni horer filmon main kuch kahaniyaan bhi daalana shuru karen
 
 
 So, my rating for 'bhoot Returns' of almost untitled story is 1
 5 star

 In Bihar (bihar Mahagathbandhan), the road to politics has also started moving towards UP
 bihar main rashtriya janata dal (rajd) nit mahagathabandhan main pehle chote dalon ke aakarshan se mahagathbandhan ke netaa utsahit najar aa rahe the lekin ab in dalon kii maang ne mahagathbandhan main seat bantwaaraa chunauti ho gai he
 In such a situation, speculations are being made on the lines of Uttar Pradesh without forming an alliance of Congress (congress)
 congress ke ek netaa kii maane to pehle congress ke 12 se 20 siton par ladane par sahmati bani thi lekin dhire-dhire anya dalon ke is gathbandhan main shaamil hone ke baad ab gathbandhan main seat bantwaare ko lekar kichakich shuru ho gai he
 Now in this alliance, apart from former Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha, Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hindustani Awam Morcha (hum), Mukesh Sahni's Developing Insan Party
 mana jaataa he vampanthi dal bhi is mahagathbandhan main shaamil honge, haalanki ab tak isaki aupchaarik ghoshnaa nahin kii gai he
 According to Congress sources, out of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar, the Congress is seeking at least 16 seats and is also indicating that the Congress will not compromise on less than 12 seats under any circumstances
 congress ke is maang ke baad rajd ne apane duusare formule par kaam shuru kar diya he, jisamen congress shaamil nahin he
 The RJD source said that Tejashwi is preferring alliances with smaller parties without Congress
 sutron kaa kahana he ki ise lekar upendra kushvaha kii party ralospa or mukesh sahani kii party vikasshil insaan party ke netaaon se baatcheet bhi ho chuki he
 Surender Kishore, a political analyst who closely watches Bihar politics, says it will not be a big deal
 unhone kaha ki haal main hue vidhansabha chunaav ke parinaamon se utsahit congress rajd kii soch se zyada seat kii maang kar rahi he
 In such a situation, it is decided that the Congress will not go below 10 seats
 kishor kehete hai, "rajd ke 10 pratishat savarna aarakshan ke virodh ke kaaran congress bhi rajd se dur hokar desh main yah sandesh dene kii koshish karegi ki rajd ne savarna aarakshan kaa virodh kiya tha, is kaaran alag hue
 On this pretext, the RJD will also separate from the Congress and enter the electoral arena to talk about strengthening its vote bank
 " aise main congress or rajd ke alag hona koi badi baat nahin he
 He also said about seat sharing, that the number of parties in the grand alliance has increased, which no one can deny
 aise main koi bhi dal seat ko lekar tyaag karne kii sthiti main nahin he
 Meanwhile, the Congress has announced a rally at Patna's Gandhi Maidan on February 3 for its performance
 is raily main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke alaava priyanka gandhi ke bhi aane kii sambhaavna he
 Congress leaders are excited about the rally
 varisht patrkaar kanhaiya bhelari kehete hai ki mahagathbandhan main seat bantwaare kaa pench congress ke kaaran fansaa hua he
 He said that Congress is the national party, in such a situation it cannot compromise on less than respectable seats
 uttar pradesh kii ranneeti par rajd yahaan kaam kar sakati he, isse bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Bhelari also believes that the RLSP will not compromise on less than four seats
 congress or ham kii apni-apni maangen hai
 In such a situation, the RJD has no other option except to form an alliance with the Congress
 vaise, rajd ke ek varisht netaa ne naam nahin jaahir karne kii shart par kaha, "rajd apni vaikalpik yojana par kaam kar rahi he parantu congress ke saath baatcheet vifal nahin hui he
 It is true that the Congress has emerged victorious in three states, but its position has improved in Bihar as well
 congress ko apni kshamta ke anusaar maang kerani chahie
 "A senior Congress leader said that Congress is a national party
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main rajd ne kitni siten jiti thi, use yah yaad rakhana chahie

 12:04 AM myanmar: aaj shah bahadur jafar kii majaar par jaaenge piem modi Four years ago the Jelly Bean episode became a controversy and now the Vaseline controversy started as VVS Laxman was accused of putting Vaseline on the bat for tampering with hot spot technique in DRS during the second Test between India and England yesterday
 lakshmana ko england dwaara shanivaar ko pehle satr main liye gaye ampiron ke faislon kii samiksha (diares) main tisare ampire ne naabad qaraar kiya
 After which former England captain Michael Vann tweeted, Is Vassalin on the bat saved Laxman
 is bhartiya ballebaaj ne tab 27 ran bana liye the or team ek wicket ganvaakar 48 ran par khel rahi thi jab james anderson ke naunve over main gend unke balle ke najadik se gai
 All England players, including Anderson, appealed to be caught behind the stumps and all gathered on the ground
 lekin ampire asad rouf ne faisla lakshmana ke paksh main sunaaya jiske baad england ke captain andrew straas ne diares ke istemaal ke liye kaha lekin isse bhi mejabaan team ko koi phayda nahin hua
 There was a heated argument between Kevin Pietersen and Laxman and later fast bowler Stuart Broad told reporters that his team was confident that the ball was off the bat
 broad ne kaha, khilaadiyon ko lagata he ki hot spot main kabhi-kabhi halkaa sa takaraav nahin dikhataa
 This is also one of its disadvantages
 lekin vivaad tab shuru hua jab vaan ne twit par lakshmana par yah aarope lagaaya kyonki balle par vaisalin or is tarah kaa koi taral padaarth hot spot takanic se nahin dikhataa
 Brad even exceeded the limit and he also checked Laxman's bat to see if there was any vaseline or fluid on it
 unhone kaha, mujhe laga tha ki gend unke balle se lagi thi
 But there was no vaseline or fluid on the bat
 hot spot main kisi bhi halke tach kaa pataa nahin chalata
 This is the second time the two countries have had a dispute with Vaseline during the Test matches

 ' chhattisgarh ke pramukh lokayukta ne tippanee kii he ki desh main koi bhi sarkari yojana bhrashtachar rahit nahin he
 In the ninth annual report of the Chhattisgarh Public Commission presented by Chief Minister Raman Singh in the Legislative Assembly, Chief of State Lokayukta Justice LC Bhadu remarked that along with increase in industry, resourcefulness, economic growth in India, corruption has also increased
 bhrashtachar ke virodh main lagaataar karrwai ke baad bhi yah samasya din-ba-din badhati ja rahi he
 Bhadu has said that in the year 2011, there have been innumerable cases of corruption, inaction, post misuse etc
 at the center and state level
 udarharanswaroop 2ji spectrum, asian khelon ke aayojan main bhrashtachar evam vibhinn prakaar ke khanan patte jari karne main, rajkeey bhoomi aavanton, janhit main bharat sarkaar or rajya sarkaar dwaara jo yojanaayen jaise manaregaa, pradhanmantri sadak yojana tathaa van kshetra kii sabhi yojanaon main bhrashtachar ke maamle bhi prakaash main aae hai
 It would not be an exaggeration to say that at this time no government scheme is corruption free
 unhone kaha he ki bhrashtachar rokane ke liye rajyon main lokayukta kaa gathan kiya gaya he, lekin lokayukta adhiniyamon main samuchit prabhaavshaalee praavdhaan nahin hone, lokayukta sanghathanon ko vaanchit suvidhaayen, adhosanrachana or jaanch karne vaali agenciyaan uplabdh nahin karaane ke kaaran janata kii aashaa ke anuroop lokayukta sanghathan bhi prabhavi rup se kaary karne main asamarth rahe hai
 Bhadu has said in his remarks that when corruption took a formidable voice, public servant Anna Hazare raised his voice for the formation of Lokpal and sat on a hunger strike in support of his demand, then involuntarily from various corners of India in various support There was a huge flood of performance, fasting etc
 isaki gambhirtha kaa aankalan kar centre sarkaar dwaara lokapal bill kaa praaroop banane ke liye adhisuchana jari kar ek sanyukt samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya
 Bhadu has said that it is undisputed that the objective with which the Lokayukta institution was formed has not been able to fulfill the expectation of the people
 lokayukta adhinium ke praavdhaanon ke anusaar sakasham praadhikari sambandhit lok sevak ke khilaaf teen maah main karrwai kar avgat karaane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he, lekin lokayukta kii anushansa par varshon tak samuchit karrwai nahin kii jaati he, kyonki karrwai usee vibhaag ke adhikariyon dwaara kii jaati he
 Therefore, the officers of the department try to save the public servant rather than punish him
 pramukh lokayukta ne kaha he ki vartmaan lokayukta adhiniyamon main anubhav ke aadhaar par khaamiyon ko dekhte hue hi nae lokapal adhinium kaa jo praaroop taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he usamen lokapal ko yah adhikaar diya ja rahaa he ki lokapal dwaara jaanch karne ke baad locasevak ke khilaaf bhrashtachar sthapit hone par lokapal dwaara hi dand tathaa sakasham praadhikari ke liye yah aavashyak hoga ki lokayukta dwaara paarit aadesh kaa paalan karen evam paalan nahin karne par sakasham praadhikari par bhi usee prakaar kaa dand kaa praavdhaan kiya ja rahaa he
 The state government should also draft and enact the Lokayukta Act as per the provisions being made in the draft Lokpal Bill

 The Congress has alleged that the BJP is now promoting itself through medicines and injections before going to the polls
 madhyapradesh congress kii pravaktashobha ojhane kaha ki party is maamle ko lekar gambhir he or jald hi isaki shikaayat chunaav ayog se kii jaaegi

 On September 14, when BJP President Amit Shah signed the letter of MP Sanjay Jaiswal to be the President of Bihar Pradesh BJP, just 4 days before that, the statement of party leader Sanjay Paswan came that "nitish Kumar is now CM The chair should be vacated for the BJP
 '' vipakshi rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke kuch netaaon ne bhi yah vichaar vyakt kiya ki nitish ko dobaaraa mahagathbandhan main aana chahie
 It is an indication that the current National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is going to fight together in the next year's assembly elections in Bihar and Nitish Kumar is yet to be elected as the Chief Ministerial candidate
 navaniyukt adhyaksh sanjay jaiswal is baat ko acchhee tarah se samajhate rahe hai lihaaja, chehre (rajya main endie netaa) ke sawaal par ve kehete hai, ''siem pad par faisla sanghathan kaa kendriya netritv or parliamentry board legaa
 Jaiswal has become the President of Bihar BJP in an uncertain environment where the question of leadership stands face to face
 party ke andar or sahyogi jad(you) ke logon main saamanjasy banaae rakhana bhi aasaan nahin he
 But the biggest challenge is to make the narrator bigger on which BJP people in the state are claiming, "now not on Nitish's face, PM Modi's face gets votes
" ''matlab saaf he ki agle ek saal se bhi kam samay main jaiswal ke saamne bhaajapa ko us jagah pahunchane kaa lakshya he jahaan use nitish kumaar kaa saath lenaa jaruri na ho
 The major reason for bjp's defeat in the 2015 assembly elections was that there was an alliance between JD (U) and RJD
 aise main pichhadaa or dalit tathaa mahadalit vot bank main bhaajapa send nahin laga saki, par ab aisa nahin he
 Devesh Kumar, vice-president of Bihar BJP, says, "even in the 2015 election, the BJP got the votes of the Yadavs
 modi sarkaar ke paanch saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan daliton or mahadaliton tak centre or rajya sarkaar kii yojanaayen pahunchi hai
 "devesh is not reacting to the cm's face for the next election, but is saying that the BJP has steadily strengthened
 bhaajapa ke ek padaadhikari kehete hai, ''jab maharashtra main pichley vidhansabha chunaav main ham shivasena ke saath nahin lade to bhaajapa sabase badi party banakar ubhari
 This may not have happened in Bihar in 2015, but now times have changed
 ''bhaajapa ke ek varisht mahasachiv kehete hai, ''jaiswal ko, sirf nayaa pradesh adhyaksh chunaa janaa he yah sochakar nahin chunaa gaya he
 He is also from the Vaishya community which is also the caste of the most powerful leader of the state BJP and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi
 '' to kya bhaajapa rajya main susheel modi ke prabhaav ko kam karnaa chaah rahi he?is par bihar bhaajapa ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''aisa nahin he, lekin party ke bahut se log khaskar kaaryakarta yah maanate hai ki susheel modi, nitish ke himachati hai
 Nitish is now 67 years old, so the need of relatively new people is in the organization which can strengthen the party for the next 15 to 20 years
 '' abhi uttar pradesh, rajasthan yaa bihar jahaan bhi adhyaksh chune gaye hai unki umr 52 se 55 saal ke bich he
 Even the National Organization General Secretary b
 el
 Santosh is also 55 years old
 bhaajapa ke ek netaa kehete hai ki jaiswal ko chune jane kii vajah sirf unki jati hi mahatvapurn nahin he
 He is young, a doctor by profession, the entire family has been associated with the Hindu Mahasabha, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the BJP since his grandfather's time
 jaiswal kisi kheme se jude hue nahin he na hi susheel modi kii tarah kendriya bhaajapa main unka koi himachati he
 He has been in charge of election in one or more district in more than 8 states and resides in his constituency instead of Delhi, except during the session of Parliament or any committee meeting
 aaj kaa yuva voter, padhe-likhe, apekshaakrit yuva or kshetra main sakriy rahane vaale netaaon ko tavajjo dete hai
 And Jaiswal fit this criterion

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has resigned
 wo kehete hai ki yah unki antaratma kii awaz he
 He said that he was not being allowed to work and when faced with allegations in public life, he has to answer
 unka ishaara rajya ke up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav kii ore tha jinpar haal ke dinon main kuch aniyamittaaon ke maamle saamne aae hai
 These cases of irregularities are Nitish's weapon and compulsion too
 majaburi isliye kyonki isi ke chalate unhen mahagathbandhan ko taak par rakhana padaa or apni raajnneeti ke mul siddhanton kii duhai dete hue mukhyamantri pad tyaagna padaa
 Weapons because Nitish is winning many more things on the basis of this resignation
 pehla pratyaksh laabh yah he ki satta nitish se dur nahin hui he
 Nitish Kumar has further strengthened his position to remain in power
 unke naitik faisle ne unki saakh or sambhaavna donon ko majboot kiya he
 Supporting Nitish has now become easier and easier for the BJP
 haalanki bhaajapa ne pehle hi kah diya tha ki wo nitish ko samarthan dene ko taiyaar hai
 So even though it seems that Nitish is out of power, in fact Nitish's roots and hold have been strengthened
 wo is ek waar se lalu prasad yadav or rajd par lag rahe aaropon se bhi paak-saaf batch nikle or yah bhi sabit kar diya ki bhale hi lalu prasad ke paas sankhya zyaada ho, raajnneeti main palada unka hi baari he
 Nitish needed Lalu in 2015, but today Lalu is a burden for Nitish and with this resignation Nitish Kumar has taken that burden off his shoulders and placed it in front of Lalu
 lalu ab nitish ko mahagathbandhan or dharmanirpekshata kii duhai dete rahen lekin isse nitish kii raajnneeti or pantare main koi tabdili kii gunjaaish nahin he
 Nitish knows how to decide the way forward and everything is proceeding like a fixed script
 chot mahagathbandhan par, daraar upie mennithish kumaar ne darasal mahagathbandhan ko hi nahin, upie ko bhi laat maari he
 Nitish Kumar has repeatedly indicated that he is the leader of the opposition
 aise netaa hai jisamen khud nirnay lene kii salaahiyat he or wo kisi bhi tarah se congress ke netritv vaali kathith vipakshi ekta ko swikaarne ke liye baadhya nahin hai
 Nitish proved this again and again
 tab, jabaki vipaksh notebandi ke khilaaf ek sur se virodh prakat kar rahaa tha
 After this, in the presidential election also, Nitish rejected the face of the UPA and announced his support to the BJP candidate
 darasal, nitish apane ko congress ke adheen nahin, congress ke samakaksh dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 He wants his image still not limited to the opposition-seeking leader in the UPA
 nitish is daanv ke baad congress ke peeche nahin, congress ke baraabar khadey ho gaye hai
 On the instructions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, dismissing the reports related to the destruction of 1
5 lakh files in the Ministry of Home Affairs, Home Minister Rajnath Singh today said that all documents including 62 files related to the murder of Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi are completely safe
 singh ne rajyasabha main aaj kaha ki nau july ko rajyasabha ke ek sadsy ne media khabaron ke aadhaar par yah kaha tha ki pradhanmantri ke nirdesh par grih mantralay ne dedh lakh filon ko nasht kar diya, jinamein rashtrapita mahatma gandhi kii hatya se judi filein shaamil thim
 He said that the Prime Minister had consultations with all the secretaries of the Central Government on 4 June
 isamen unhone kaarysthal par swatchta evam saaf safai banaae rakhane sahit kaary samskruti evam kaary ke parivesh ko behatar banane par jor diya tha
 He said that in the directive issued by the Cabinet Secretary after this, it was also said that 'files and papers should be sorted according to the rules of record keeping
 
 This exercise should be completed in three to four weeks
 ' According to this instruction, Rajnath Singh said that the files kept in various sections of the Ministry of Home Affairs were reviewed from June 5 to July 8 and a total of 11,100 files were destroyed
 unhone kaha ki nasht kii gai 11,100 filon main se ek bhi mahatma gandhi kii hatya se judi nahin thi
 He also clarified that no Dr
 in these files
 rajendra prasad, bahadur shastri yaa lord mountbeton se judi nahin thi
 Sonali Acharji spoke to Lisa Jain, India's representative on the college board and learned some mantras for students wanting to go abroad for higher education
 college board, ek note-for-profit orgenigeshan he, jisaki sthapana 1900 main kii gai thi
 The aim was to increase the chances of acquiring higher education
 har saal college board 70 lakh se zyada students ko kuch kaaryakramon ke jariye college main pravesh paane kii taiyaari main madad karata he
 These include SAT, PSAT / NMSQT and Advanced Placement Program
 PSAT kya he? yah students kii madad kaise karata he?priliminery eseti-neshnal merit scolership qualifing test (PSAT / NMSQT) vyapak or manakikrut akalan he jo skulon main oktober main yojit hota he or students ko SAT kii taiyaari karne main madad karata he
 PSAT is an important step on the way to university
 yah teen kshetron main students kii yogyata kaa akalan karata haih critical reeding, riting or maith
 Advantages of PSAT 1
 psatskora report students kii yogyata or uske pradarshan kii vistrut samiksha muhaiyaa karaata he, jisase student apni takat or kamajori kii pahchaan kar pate hai taaki ve SAT or us tarah kii duusari parikshaon kii taiyaari karte samay sahi ranneeti bana saken
 2
 ankon ko vishvavidhyalayon main nahin dikhaaya jaataa he, isliye yah students kii apni yogyata kii parakh karne kaa ek dabaav-rahit tarika he
 3
 yah SAT kii keemat kaa ek-chauthai se kam kharchila he, yah kharch ke maamle main bhi badhiya he
 4
 students muft main online college planning sansadhano or tuls ko hasil kar sakate hai
 How to register for PSAT: Many high-schools conduct PSAT in the month of October (centers can take the test between 15 to 18 October every year)
 agar aap PSAT lenaa chaahate hai to apane hyskool counslar yaa principal se sampark karke jaruri suchanaaen praapt kar sakate hai or yah bhi pataa kar sakate hai ki kya aapkaa skool 2014 main yah test legaa
 The us-india Educational Foundation (USIEF) also conducts this test in some of its centers
 USIEF main registration ke bare main soochna ke liechhat

 org
 go to in chaatro ke liye kuch suzav :1
 Start early: Many students, who want to study abroad, believe that they can plan it only in class XII
 unhen yah nahin pataa hota he ki isamen kitna samay lagata he or kitna prayaas karnaa padataa he
 Students should start their efforts in class x so that they already understand what is the right procedure to go to college
 masalan, agar student ko SAT main baithna he to unhen 12veen kaa intjaar nahin karnaa chahie
 They should start it from the 10th
 12veen main apana samay aavedan ke anya kshetron par dhyaan dene ke liye bachaana chahie
 If effort is needed for the second time, the effort made in the 12th should be used for an experience
 2
 Think beyond college rankings: Many companies publish a ranking of Universities
 kuch kisi ek desh ke liye hoti hai to kuch global ranking hoti hai
 It is important to know that certain criteria are made to determine the university's ranking and the rankings are based on them
 students ko khud se yah sawaal poochne kii jarurat he ki kya ranking main un karkon ko mahatv diya gaya he, jo unke liye mahatvapurn hai
 Often, the answer may be no
 aise main satarkta se aage badhanaa chahie
 The information taken in the ranking may not help you find the best college for you
 ranking ko dekhte samay ek or baat yaad rakhane kii he- agar kisi uniwarsity ko kul milakar ooncha rank diya gaya he to iskaa matlab yah nahin ki aap jis subject main daakhila chaahate hai, uske liye bhi vah mahatvapurn ho
 You should look at the ranking of that university in terms of the subject of your interest
 ensipi adhyaksh or kendriya krishi mantri sharad pavaar ne voting ko lekar vivaadit bayaan diya he
 Pawar has instructed his supporters to eradicate ink and vote in two places
 vivaad badhate par pavaar kii party ne kaha ki unke netaa ji ne to majaak main yah baat kahi he
 Sharad Pawar, who is preparing for the Lok Sabha elections, held a meeting in Navi Mumbai
 yahaan apiemasi market ke kamgaaron ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'is baar satara or mumbai main alag-alag din matdaan ho rahaa he, to aap sab pehle satara main vot karo phir 24 taarikh ko mumbai main aakar vot karo
 But while doing this, do not forget to wipe the flame on your hand
 pichhali baar voting ek hi din hui thi to kam voting hui
 This time voting is on different days
 'pavaar ne bijepi ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi par bhi hamalaa bolaa
 He said, 'I heard the announcement of the Prime Minister before the elections for the first time in the history of the country
 jo desh kaa itihaas nahin jaanate, wo pradhanmantri kya banenge? maharashtra main sookhaa padane par gujarat se ai madad karne vaale sanstha par gujarat main kanoonee karwai kii gai
 How can the CM of such a state become the Prime Minister of the country
 'voting par pavaar ke bayaan par bavaal badha to ensipi kii taraf se party adhyaksh ko bachaane kii koshish kii gai
 Party Spokesperson Nawab Malik said that Sharad Pawar was joking
 malik ne kaha, 'aap sabha kaa video dekhenge to wo apni baat kehete hue muskura rahe hai
 However, opposition parties are not in a mood to spare Pawar
 bijepi ke pravaktaa madhav bhandari ne kaha, 'sharad pavaar ne jo kaha he, usase saaf he ki maharashtra main ab baat ensipi-congress kis tarah jitati aa rahi he
 Sharad Pawar himself told his secret
 ye dikhaa rahaa he ki sharad pavaar ke liye kaayade-kanoon kuch myne nahin rakhata
 It has been attested that the Maharashtra Home Minister RR Patil is his own man, so we can say anything
 chunaav ayog ko pavaar ke khilaaf karrwai kerani chahie
 It is a crime to vote from two places and to encourage in this way

 pakistan ke kabje vaale aaazaad kashmir main ek baar phir se logon virodh kii aawaaj uthaai he
 Tahira Tauqir, president of the women's wing of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, told a public meeting in Mandol that you do not get respect as long as you are a slave

 australia ke khilaaf chauthe test match main khilne se pratibandhit kiye gayi bhartiya cricket captain mahendra singh dhoni subah mashhoor agunr ke bagichon main se ek kii saiyr par nikle
 It was natural that Dhoni was accompanied by his wife Sakshi
 team ke media manager ji es walia ne haalanki iskaa khandan kiya ki koi khilaadi angoor ke bagichon kii saiyr karne par niklaa tha
 Dhoni arrived here from Perth with the team on Wednesday evening
 unke shuukravaar ko nets par abhyaas karne kii sambhaavna he
 There has been little change in the schedule of the Indian team
 pehle usne shuukravaar ko vishram karne kaa man banaaya tha
 Dhoni has been severely criticized after India's 0–0 loss to Australia in the series
 iske alaava unhen perth main dhimi over gati ke kaaran 24 janvari se yahaan hone vaale chauthe test match ke liye pratibandhit kar diya gaya
 There are over 50 vineyards in Adelaide and it is said that in 1844, the wine of Adelaide Hills was sent to Queen Victoria
 do diggaj rahul dravid or vivies lakshmana jaise sankatmochakon ke bina barason baad test khilne utar rahi team india guuruuvaar ko newjiland ke khilaaf do maichon kii siries kaa aagaaj karegi
 For India, this series will not be less than the beginning of any new journey in Test cricket
 saurav ganguli, anil kumble, rahul dravid or haal hi main lakshmana ke sanyas ke baad ab ‘ faib five’ main se sirf sachin tendulkar bhartiya team main bache hai
 The challenge for India is also to overcome this phase of change
 is satr main bharat ko 10 test, 13 vanade or teen tii-20 maichon ke saath agle maheene srilanka main isisi tii-20 vishwa cap bhi khelnaa he
 The Australian team still has not recovered from the transition after the retirement of its greats
 bharat kii yuva brigade ke saamne bhi is kathin daur se nipatane kii kadi chunauti he
 He also has the experience of Tendulkar
 bhartiya team saat maheene baad test khelegi
 In the last two series, he had to face a crushing defeat
 england ne use 4-0 se haraakar number van kaa taj chhina tha, uske baad australia ne bhi isi antar se parrast kiya
 After that elimination, Dravid and now Laxman, the two pillars of Indian cricket, announced their retirement
 donon ne milakar pichley 16 saal main 298 maichon main kul 22069 ran banaaye hai
 Dravid retired in March, while Laxman, after practicing hard on NCA, suddenly surprised everyone by announcing his retirement
 unhone apane gharelu maidan par pehle test se purv hi turant prabhaav se antarrashtriya cricket ko alavida kah diya
 This also opened up the gap of communication gap within the team
 lakshmana ne to khulkar kaha ki vah captain mahendra singh dhoni se sampark nahin kar sake kyonki unase sampark karnaa bahut mushkil hota he
 This has given rise to speculation of communication gap within the team
 sthaneey sitare lakshmana ke nahin rahane se logon kii ruchi match main ghat gai he
 Now it is to see how Dhoni's team cope with these situations
 ek saal ke bheetar test ranking main paanchaven sthaan par khiski bhartiya team ke yuvaaon par badi jimmedaari he ki agle saal dakshin africa daure se pehle team ko jeet kii raah par laaye
 Virat Kohli has become the number three strong contender in the batting order on the basis of the best performance of the last few years
 vaise paanchaven or chathe number kaa vikalp talashna badi chunauti he jiske liye suresh raina, cheteshwar pujaara or es badrinaath daud main hai
 Pujara has returned to the team after a knee operation while Raina could be given a chance in the Test after a good performance in the ODI series in Sri Lanka
 salaami jodi ke rup main gautam gambhir or virendra sahvaag hai lihaaja ajinkya rahane ko intjaar karnaa pad saktaa he
 Without Dravid (record 210 catches in 164 matches) and Laxman (135 catches in 134 matches), India will also have to face the problem of fielding in slip
 duniya kii aathven number kii team newjiland ke khilaaf acha pradarshan karke bharat ke paas england or australia daure kii kadavin yaadon ko bhulane kaa sunaharaa mauka he
 Meanwhile, the pitch of the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium is expected to be helpful to the spinners
 november 2010 main yahaan khele gaye aakhri test main sapaat pich kii kaaphi aalochana hui thi jisamen harbhajan singh ne naabad shatak banaaya tha
 Brendon mccullum had a career-best 225 runs in that match, while opener Tim mclintosh also scored a century
 is baar curator ne kaha he ki gend duusare din se hi turn lene lagegi, aise main bhartiya spin tikdi aar aswin, pragyan ojha or piyush chawla upyogi sabit ho sakate hai
 In the absence of Harbhajan, Ashwin will be looking to confirm his place in the team
 bhartiya team gharelu halaat main acha khelti he or kiviyon se use kadi chunauti milane kii ummid bhi nahin he

 Uttarakhand these days remains a living example of the paradox of nature
 ek ore upree ilaake main maukey-bemauke padati barf or barish, to duusari ore jangalon main vikaraal rup dhaaran karti aag
 After the Chardham Yatra started from May 7, it has been snowed about four times
 iske alaava kai ilaakon main ab tak jaadon main padi barf ke bhandar jamaa hai
 On the other hand, fire is burning in the forests of Uttarakhand
 is fire sijan main ab tak wanon main aag kii ghatnaon kii sankhya 711 pahunch chuki he, jisase 992 hectare van kshetra prabhavit hua he
 There were reports of fire in more than two dozen places in Pauri, Almora, Nainital and Champawat districts
 almoda ke manila jangal main bhadki aag se vahaan rakhaa lise (gond) kaa stock bhi khaak ho gaya
 Inadequate preparations: With the rise in mercury from May 1, the forests began to blaze rapidly and the inadequate preparations started coming out in the fragrance
 sawaal uthne lage hai ki jab agnikaal shuru hone se pehle fire linon ke phukan samet anya kadam uthaae gaye the to aag kii ghatnaon par turant niyantran kyon nahin ho paa rahaa
 In many areas, it has also come to light that the forests continued to smolder for five-six days
 graminon ke sahyog se jaise-taise vahaan aag par kaabo paaya gaya
 a fire in the Manila forest area of the Salt Block in Almora district engulfed the Lisa (vanopaj) stock kept in the forest near the residential area
 dekhte hi dekhte lise se bhare 150 tin ne aag pakad lee or inamen hone vaale visphot se log sahame rahe
 Due to this, there was black smoke in Ratkhal market and surrounding areas
 yahi nahin, puriachera main gas godaam ke najadik bhi aag pahunch gai thi, jis par kisi tarah kaabo paaya ja sakaa
 At a time when fire is burning in the forests of Uttarakhand, several top officials, including the Chief Chief Conservator of Forests, Jayaraj, are on a foreign tour
 iske liye unhone van mantri kii ijaajat bhi nahin lee thi
 Due to this, the Forest Minister has written a letter to the Chief Secretary Personnel

 In this respect, 3
 16 lakh hectare kshetra ke hisse main ek karod kii raashi aa rahi he
 This amount has been allocated to all the forest divisions as well as the Park and Century Administration
 lekin, yah oont ke munh main jira sabit ho rahi he
 The department has deployed around 6000 workers to extinguish the fire for four months
 inhen pratimah chah hajaar rupee maandey dene ko hi 3
 60 crores is needed

 In such a situation, how will arrangements be made in such a low budget, this concern is haunting the department
 vibhaag ke ek varisht adhikari kaa kahana he ki jangalon kii aag bujhane ke liye sarkaar se or bajet kii maang kii gai he
 The increase in fire cases in Uttarakhand is also associated with climate change

 He had also claimed that 25 percent of Muslims voted for him in the Gujarat assembly elections

 Andrew Symonds, who accused Harbhajan Singh of racism during the Sydney Test, has said that he did not get justice in the case
 "harbhajan par se bain hataa diya gaya, samajhadaar log justise hanson ke is faisle par sawaal uthaa sakate hai lekin unhone jo faisla liya wo muhaiyaa karai gai jaankaree ke aadhaar par tha, darasal isisi ne unhen harbhajan ke trek record ke bare main puri jaankaree nahin di or harbhajan batch nikle
 According to the judge, i instigated Harbhajan and he also pointed fingers at my explanation that the ground is not a place to make friends
 main aaj bhi apni baat par kaayam hum, main maidan par apana sabakuch jhonk detaa hum lekin maidan ke baahar main koi shikaayat lekar nahin jaataa

 " unke mutabik, sidney vivaad ke baad se hi wo khud se ladate rahe or unhone cricket ko alavida kehane ke bare main bhi sochaa
 "I didn't want to think about cricket, i felt that enough, i was tired physically and mentally
 main jaanata hum ki kuch logon ko ye samaj main nahin aayega lekin main cricket se nahin uske baahar kii ghatnaon se dukhi tha
 "symonds has also mentioned Monkey Chants in his book during the ODI series in 2007, and Harbhajan even called him Monkey during his time
 "main 35wein over main harbhajan ke saath bhid gaya or unhone mujhe bandar kaha
 i understood what he was saying and soon the whole team came to know about it but i did not want to give this thing and so i did not lodge any complaint
 "symonds likhte hai ki match ke baad unhone harbhajan se is bare main baat kii or bhajji ne unase maafee bhi maangi
 After this book by Symonds, one thing is clear that the Australian players have not forgotten the bitter memories of the Sydney Test and it will be heard for a long time

 The author has divided the economic development into three parts, explaining the liberalization that came during the nineties: after 1992-97, 98-2002 and 2003

 Second, the new employment opportunities gave the educated youth an opportunity for economic and personal development

 The author puts a red mark on the flaws of the economy
