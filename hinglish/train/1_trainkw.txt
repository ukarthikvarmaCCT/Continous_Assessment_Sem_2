 However, only the upper part of the phone is visible in this
 chunki duusari companiyaan ab aise hi smartfones launch kar rahi hai jinamein kam se kam bejal hai
 So there is a compulsion of One Pulse
 kyonki is baar khabar ye thi kii company agle saal oneplus 6 launch karegi
 One Plus co-founder Carl tweeted a picture containing a portrait image
 yani oneplus 5T main dual camera seoup diya jayega
 According to reports, the One Plus 5T will have a 6-inch screen with an aspect ratio of 18: 9

 It is worth noting that recently on the official website of One Plus, the flagship smartphone oneplus 5 was also out of stock in the market like America and UK
 itnaa hi nahin kuch deshon main grey vairient uplabdh nahin he or sirf 6GB ram vaala soft gold vairient hi mil rahaa he

 So it can be a coincidence as well

 Calling a press conference in Barabanki, he announced that till the month of January, State Congress President Dr
 nirmal khatri ko hataa diya jayega or upi congress main vyapak pherbadal hoga
 Beni's statement is seen as a rebellion between the party in UP in an atmosphere created by the Congress's poor performance in the assembly elections in four states
 yah pehla mauka he jab benny ne sidhe taur par pradesh congress adhyaksh ko nishane par liya ho
 After the defeat of the Congress generals in Delhi and Chhattisgarh after a bitter defeat in four Hindi-speaking states, there has been a debate among the Congressmen of Uttar Pradesh whether the winds of change will flow here or the Lok Sabha elections under the current Subai Nizam

 nyaayadhishon ko barkhaast karne sambandhi ek maamle main pakistan ke purv raashtrapati parvej musharraf ko aaj unke farmahouse se giraftaar kar liya gaya or do din ke liye hiraasat main bhej diya gaya
 Musharraf is the first ex-army chief to face such action
 giraftaar ke baad parvej musharraf kaa aarope he ki unke khilaaf yah sari karrwai raajnneeti se prerit he
 a day earlier, when the court canceled his anticipatory bail, he walked dramatically from the court premises to avoid arrest
 police adhikariyon ne 69 varshiya purv sainya shaasha ko aaj subah giraftaar kiya or unhen nyaayik magistrate mohammad abbaas shah kii adaalat le gaye
 The judge sent the former army chief into two-day 'transit custody' after hearing the arguments of the lawyers of Musharraf and several people who had filed petitions against the former military ruler
 nyaayadhish ne police ko yah bhi aadesh diya ki musharraf ko do din main aatankwaad nirodhak adaalat main pesh kiya jaae kyonki islamabad hoicourt ne guuruuvaar ko praadhikariyon ko aadesh diya tha ki purv sainya shaasha par varsh 2007 main apatkaal lagu karne ke liye aatankwaad nirodhak kanoon ke tahat aarope lagaae jaaen
 Musharraf can appeal in the Supreme Court against the judge's order
 varsh 2007 main apatkaal ke dauraan supremecourt ke pradhan nyaayamurti iftikhar choudhary sahit darjanon nyaayadhishon ko hiraasat main rakhane ke liye musharraf ke khilaaf darj ek maamle kii jaanch main police adhikariyon ke saath sahyog na karne ke aarope main islamabad hai court ne guuruuvaar ko purv sainya shaasha kii giraftaar ke aadesh die the
 Today he was arrested
 televijan par dikhaae gaye footage main darjanon pulicekarmi or ardhsainik bal ke jawan musharraf ko nyaayadhish ke chote se karyaalay main le jate najar aa rahe hai
 In the footage, Musharraf is seen troubled wearing a salwar kameez and jacket
 vah nyaayadhish ke karyaalay se nikalakar apni car kii ore jate bhi najar aa rahe hai
 Musharraf waited for a while in the car as the judge initially reserved his verdict
 subah 9 bajkar 15 minute se kuch hi pehle nyaayadhish ne musharraf kii giraftaar kaa aadesh jari kiya, lekin usase pehle musharraf apane suraksha daste ke saath farmahouse ravaanaa ho chuke the
 Officials said Musharraf would be detained at his farm house in Chak Shahzad on the outskirts of Islamabad
 unke anusaar, musharraf kii jaan ko khatra he isliye unhen jail nahin bheja ja saktaa
 Police officials previously told the judge that they did not need Musharraf's custody and could be held in judicial custody
 baharhaal, un kai logon ke vakeelon ne musharraf ko police hiraasat main rakhe jane par jor diya jin logon ne varsh 2007 main apatkaal lagu karne or sarvocch nyaaypalika ke 60 se adhik sadasyon ko hiraasat main rakhe jane ko lekar musharraf ke khilaaf yachikaayen daayar kii thim
 These lawyers also questioned why the police did not handcuff Musharraf after his arrest
 musharraf ke vakil qamar afjal ne tark diya ki unke muvakkil ko nyaayik hiraasat main rakhaa janaa chahie kyonki unki (musharraf kii) jaan ko gambhir khatra he
 Sources said the authorities had asked for Musharraf to be placed in judicial custody as doing so, the Islamabad administration would declare his farm house in Chak Shahzad a 'sub jail' and keep the former military ruler in custody there
 praadhikari isi upaay par adhik jor de rahe hai, kyonki musharraf kii jaan ko khatra dekhte hue adhikari unhen jail main nahin rakhana chaahate
 As soon as Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui canceled Musharraf's anticipatory bail on Thursday and ordered the police to detain him, Musharraf and his security personnel left the Islamabad High Court and headed straight to the farmhouse
 aaj musharraf ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Musharraf's lawyers could not file an appeal in the Supreme Court on Thursday, as they had not completed some necessary formalities before the Supreme Court closed
 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki musharraf kii giraftaar se nyaaypalika or shaktishaalee sena ke bich takaraav ho saktaa he, kyonki sena apane purv pramukh ko saarvajanik rup se apamaanit hote nahin dekhnaa chaahegi
 He also said that several members of the current military leadership, including Army Chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, could be drawn in the case if a hearing is held against Musharraf
 musharraf ne varsh 2007 main jab apatkaal lagu kiya tha tab unke karibiyon main ye log shaamil the
 The comments kareeb chaar saal tak aatmanirvaasan main rahane ke baad musharraf pichley saal desh laute hai
 Since then he has been facing many legal problems
 is saptaah ke shuru main musharraf, agle maah hone ja rahe aam chunaav ladane ke liye ayogy ghoshit kar die gaye
 At the same time, his ambition for political withdrawal also came to an end
 adhikariyon ne unke pakistan se baahar jane par roak bhi laga di he
 After the arrest, Pervez Musharraf alleges that all this action against him is politically motivated
 ek din pehle hi adaalat ne unki agrim jamaanat jab radd kii thi to giraftaar se bachane ke liye vah naatakeey tareeke se adaalat parisar se chalate bane the
 Police officials arrested the 69-year-old former military ruler this morning and took him to the court of judicial magistrate Mohammad Abbas Shah
 musharraf ke vakeelon or purv sainya shaasha ke khilaaf yachikaayen daakhil karne vaale kai logon ke vakil kii daleelein sunne ke baad nyaayadhish ne purv sena pramukh ko do din kii ‘transit hiraasat’ main bhej diya
 The judge also ordered the police to produce Musharraf in an anti-terrorism court in two days as the Islamabad High Court on Thursday ordered authorities to impose an emergency on the former military ruler in 2007 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act Be charged nyaayadhish ke aadesh ke khilaaf musharraf supreme court main apil kar sakate hai
 The Islamabad High Court on Thursday accused the former military ruler of not cooperating with police officers in the investigation of a case registered against Musharraf for detaining dozens of judges, including Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary, during the Emergency in 2007
 Arrest orders were made
 aaj unhen giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Television footage showed dozens of policemen and paramilitary personnel carrying Musharraf to the small office of the judge
 footage main salwar kameez or jacket pahane musharraf pareshaan dikh rahe hai
 He is also seen leaving the judge's office and heading towards his car
 car main musharraf ne kuch der intjaar kiya, kyonki nyaayadhish ne shuru main apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 Shortly before 9:15 in the morning, the judge issued an order for Musharraf's arrest, but before that Musharraf left for the farmhouse with his security squad
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki musharraf ko islamabad ke bahari hisse main chak shahzad sthit unke farm house main hiraasat main rakhaa jayega
 According to him, Musharraf's life is in danger so he cannot be sent to jail
 purv main nyaayadhish se police adhikariyon ne kaha ki unhen musharraf kii hiraasat kii jarurat nahin he or unhen nyaayik hiraasat main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 However, lawyers of several people who had filed petitions against Musharraf for enforcing the Emergency and detaining more than 60 members of the Supreme Judiciary in 2007, insisted on Musharraf being placed in police custody
 in vakeelon ne yah bhi sawaal kiya ki musharraf ko police ne giraftaar karne ke baad hathkadiyaan kyon nahin lagaayee
 Musharraf's lawyer Qamar Afzal argued that his client should be kept in judicial custody as his (musharraf's) life is in grave danger
 sutron ne bataaya ki praadhikariyon ne musharraf ko nyaayik hiraasat main rakhe jane ke liye kaha tha, kyonki aisa karne par islamabad kaa prashasan chak shahzad sthit unke farm house ko ‘up jail’ ghoshit kar vahaan purv sainya shaasha ko hiraasat main rakh sakegaa
 Authorities are putting more emphasis on this measure, because the authorities do not want to keep him in jail because of the threat to Musharraf's life
 guuruuvaar ko nyaayamurti shaukat ajij siddiqui ne jaise hi musharraf kii agrim jamaanat radd kii or police ko unhen hiraasat main lene kaa aadesh diya, usee samay musharraf or unke surakshakarmi islamabad hoicourt se nikalakar sidhe farmahouse kii ore ravaanaa ho gaye the
 Today Musharraf was arrested
 musharraf ke vakil guuruuvaar ko supreme court main apil daayar nahin kar sake, kyonki sarvocch adaalat ke band hone se pehle tak vah kuch jaruri aupchaariktaayen puri nahin kar paae the
 Analysts say Musharraf's arrest could lead to a confrontation between the judiciary and the powerful army, as the military would not like to see its former chief publicly humiliated
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki agar musharraf ke khilaaf sunwaayee kii jaati he to sena pramukh general ashfak parvej kayaani sahit vartmaan sainya netritv ke kai sadasyon ko maamle main khinchaa ja saktaa he
 These people were among those close to him when Musharraf imposed the Emergency in 2007
 tippaniyan Musharraf returned to the country last year after being in self-exile for nearly four years
 tab se unhen kai kanoonee samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Earlier this week Musharraf was disqualified to contest the general elections due next month
 isi ke saath hi raajnneetik vaapasi kii unki mahatvakanksha par bhi viraam lag gaya
 Authorities have also banned his exit from Pakistan

 However, lawyers of several people who had filed petitions against Musharraf for enforcing the Emergency and detaining more than 60 members of the Supreme Judiciary in 2007, insisted on Musharraf being placed in police custody
 in vakeelon ne yah bhi sawaal kiya ki musharraf ko police ne giraftaar karne ke baad hathkadiyaan kyon nahin lagaayee
 Musharraf's lawyer Qamar Afzal argued that his client should be kept in judicial custody as his (musharraf's) life is in grave danger
 sutron ne bataaya ki praadhikariyon ne musharraf ko nyaayik hiraasat main rakhe jane ke liye kaha tha, kyonki aisa karne par islamabad kaa prashasan chak shahzad sthit unke farm house ko ‘up jail’ ghoshit kar vahaan purv sainya shaasha ko hiraasat main rakh sakegaa
 Authorities are putting more emphasis on this measure, because the authorities do not want to keep him in jail because of the threat to Musharraf's life
 guuruuvaar ko nyaayamurti shaukat ajij siddiqui ne jaise hi musharraf kii agrim jamaanat radd kii or police ko unhen hiraasat main lene kaa aadesh diya, usee samay musharraf or unke surakshakarmi islamabad hoicourt se nikalakar sidhe farmahouse kii ore ravaanaa ho gaye the
 Today Musharraf was arrested
 musharraf ke vakil guuruuvaar ko supreme court main apil daayar nahin kar sake, kyonki sarvocch adaalat ke band hone se pehle tak vah kuch jaruri aupchaariktaayen puri nahin kar paae the
 Analysts say Musharraf's arrest could lead to a confrontation between the judiciary and the powerful army, as the military would not like to see its former chief publicly humiliated
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki agar musharraf ke khilaaf sunwaayee kii jaati he to sena pramukh general ashfak parvej kayaani sahit vartmaan sainya netritv ke kai sadasyon ko maamle main khinchaa ja saktaa he
 These people were among those close to him when Musharraf imposed the Emergency in 2007
 tippaniyan Musharraf returned to the country last year after being in self-exile for nearly four years
 tab se unhen kai kanoonee samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Earlier this week Musharraf was disqualified to contest the general elections due next month
 isi ke saath hi raajnneetik vaapasi kii unki mahatvakanksha par bhi viraam lag gaya
 Authorities have also banned his exit from Pakistan
 police adhikariyon ne 69 varshiya purv sainya shaasha ko aaj subah giraftaar kiya or unhen nyaayik magistrate mohammad abbaas shah kii adaalat le gaye
 The judge sent the former army chief into two-day 'transit custody' after hearing the arguments of the lawyers of Musharraf and several people who had filed petitions against the former military ruler
 nyaayadhish ne police ko yah bhi aadesh diya ki musharraf ko do din main aatankwaad nirodhak adaalat main pesh kiya jaae kyonki islamabad hoicourt ne guuruuvaar ko praadhikariyon ko aadesh diya tha ki purv sainya shaasha par varsh 2007 main apatkaal lagu karne ke liye aatankwaad nirodhak kanoon ke tahat aarope lagaae jaaen
 Musharraf can appeal in the Supreme Court against the judge's order
 varsh 2007 main apatkaal ke dauraan supremecourt ke pradhan nyaayamurti iftikhar choudhary sahit darjanon nyaayadhishon ko hiraasat main rakhane ke liye musharraf ke khilaaf darj ek maamle kii jaanch main police adhikariyon ke saath sahyog na karne ke aarope main islamabad hai court ne guuruuvaar ko purv sainya shaasha kii giraftaar ke aadesh die the
 Today he was arrested
 televijan par dikhaae gaye footage main darjanon pulicekarmi or ardhsainik bal ke jawan musharraf ko nyaayadhish ke chote se karyaalay main le jate najar aa rahe hai
 In the footage, Musharraf is seen troubled wearing a salwar kameez and jacket
 vah nyaayadhish ke karyaalay se nikalakar apni car kii ore jate bhi najar aa rahe hai
 Musharraf waited for a while in the car as the judge initially reserved his verdict
 subah 9 bajkar 15 minute se kuch hi pehle nyaayadhish ne musharraf kii giraftaar kaa aadesh jari kiya, lekin usase pehle musharraf apane suraksha daste ke saath farmahouse ravaanaa ho chuke the
 Officials said Musharraf would be detained at his farm house in Chak Shahzad on the outskirts of Islamabad
 unke anusaar, musharraf kii jaan ko khatra he isliye unhen jail nahin bheja ja saktaa
 Police officials previously told the judge that they did not need Musharraf's custody and could be held in judicial custody
 baharhaal, un kai logon ke vakeelon ne musharraf ko police hiraasat main rakhe jane par jor diya jin logon ne varsh 2007 main apatkaal lagu karne or sarvocch nyaaypalika ke 60 se adhik sadasyon ko hiraasat main rakhe jane ko lekar musharraf ke khilaaf yachikaayen daayar kii thim
 These lawyers also questioned why the police did not handcuff Musharraf after his arrest
 musharraf ke vakil qamar afjal ne tark diya ki unke muvakkil ko nyaayik hiraasat main rakhaa janaa chahie kyonki unki (musharraf kii) jaan ko gambhir khatra he
 Sources said the authorities had asked for Musharraf to be placed in judicial custody as doing so, the Islamabad administration would declare his farm house in Chak Shahzad a 'sub jail' and keep the former military ruler in custody there
 praadhikari isi upaay par adhik jor de rahe hai, kyonki musharraf kii jaan ko khatra dekhte hue adhikari unhen jail main nahin rakhana chaahate
 As soon as Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui canceled Musharraf's anticipatory bail on Thursday and ordered the police to detain him, Musharraf and his security personnel left the Islamabad High Court and headed straight to the farmhouse
 aaj musharraf ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Musharraf's lawyers could not file an appeal in the Supreme Court on Thursday, as they had not completed some necessary formalities before the Supreme Court closed
 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki musharraf kii giraftaar se nyaaypalika or shaktishaalee sena ke bich takaraav ho saktaa he, kyonki sena apane purv pramukh ko saarvajanik rup se apamaanit hote nahin dekhnaa chaahegi
 He also said that several members of the current military leadership, including Army Chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, could be drawn in the case if a hearing is held against Musharraf
 musharraf ne varsh 2007 main jab apatkaal lagu kiya tha tab unke karibiyon main ye log shaamil the
 The comments kareeb chaar saal tak aatmanirvaasan main rahane ke baad musharraf pichley saal desh laute hai
 Since then he has been facing many legal problems
 is saptaah ke shuru main musharraf, agle maah hone ja rahe aam chunaav ladane ke liye ayogy ghoshit kar die gaye
 At the same time, his ambition for political withdrawal also came to an end
 adhikariyon ne unke pakistan se baahar jane par roak bhi laga di he
 The judge sent the former army chief into two-day 'transit custody' after hearing the arguments of the lawyers of Musharraf and several people who had filed petitions against the former military ruler

 adhikariyon ne unke pakistan se baahar jane par roak bhi laga di he
 The judge also ordered the police to produce Musharraf in an anti-terrorism court in two days as the Islamabad High Court on Thursday ordered authorities to impose an emergency on the former military ruler in 2007 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act Be charged nyaayadhish ke aadesh ke khilaaf musharraf supreme court main apil kar sakate hai
 The Islamabad High Court on Thursday accused the former military ruler of not cooperating with police officers in the investigation of a case registered against Musharraf for detaining dozens of judges, including Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary, during the Emergency in 2007
 Arrest orders were made
 aaj unhen giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Television footage showed dozens of policemen and paramilitary personnel carrying Musharraf to the small office of the judge
 footage main salwar kameez or jacket pahane musharraf pareshaan dikh rahe hai
 He is also seen leaving the judge's office and heading towards his car
 car main musharraf ne kuch der intjaar kiya, kyonki nyaayadhish ne shuru main apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 Shortly before 9:15 in the morning, the judge issued an order for Musharraf's arrest, but before that Musharraf left for the farmhouse with his security squad
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki musharraf ko islamabad ke bahari hisse main chak shahzad sthit unke farm house main hiraasat main rakhaa jayega

 On Monday in the Ghaziabad district court, i tried my best to stay with Kapil, who was in the CBI special court there
 rajesh or noopur talwaar kii ore se pesh hone vaale vakeelon main ek hai or manish sisodiya ke sahyogi bhi hai
 He carried two copies of the same decision with him

 Every second he saved could shorten the sword couple's stay in Dasna prison by one second

 The 'certified copy' of the verdict was to reach the CBI court where a clerk would certify that it was indeed a certified copy
 phir vah prati computer vibhaag main punarikshan ke liye jaati (vaise bhi faisla online uplabdh tha)
 The file then comes to court where a clerk would outline the relevant portions for the judge

 Expectations of filing court proceedings went down

 This time the case was about the police attack on lawyers in Meerut
 vah to talwaar dampati kii khushkismati thi ki jaj chedhri vahaan uplabdh the or kuch der bahes karne ke baad clerkon ne matter unke paas bhej diya
 He signed the order for release at around three o'clock

 The raft in the earlier court was such that it fell from a hill now that it fell — it was somehow tied to a rope and jugaad

 The doctors who had been sued in the medical equipment scam would have had to seek the help of the court staff to squeeze into it

 The mound area of lakshmana of Lucknow, which is now known as the mound mosque

 Let me tell you that two BJP councilors Rajneesh Gupta and Ramakrishna Yadav proposed to install a large statue of Laxman on the municipal land near the mound of mosque, then the bjp's Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia gave it open support
 haalanki muslim paksh ne bhi is maamle ko garmane main koi kasar nahin chodi
 In this episode, the Imam of the mound with mosque first opposed it, then Shia and Sunni Maulana protested saying that the installation of Laxman's statue here would cause tension and controversy

 Whereas the Samajwadi Party and BSP, considered to be friendly to Muslims, have kept mysterious silence on this matter
 bijepi pravaktaa manish shukla ke mutabik lakhanu ko lakshmana kii nagari kaha jaataa rahaa he
 They say that even as faith, people call it the city of Laxman
 aise main agar yahaan nagar nigam kii kisi jameen par lakshmana kii pratimaa lagane kaa prastaav kiya gaya he to isamen koi galat baat nahin he
 On the other hand, BJP Mayor Samyukta Bhatia is intent on installing the idol of Laxman, although she says that although the final decision has not been taken yet, we will definitely install the idol
 bijepi ke lakshmana kii murti lagane ko lekar siyasat honi tay he

 Although Meenawala has not directed any film before Lavayatri
 wo yashraj binar ke liye kaam kiya karte the
 This time he has tried to direct Ayush Sharma and Varina Hussain for the Salman Khan production film
 film main ram kapur or ronit roy kii bhi ahm bhoomika he
 Finally, Meenawala has made her debut film Lavayatri Hai Cassie, let's review

 Michelle falls in love
 sushrut, mishael ko bahut zyada pyaar karne lag jaataa he
 Meanwhile Michelle returns to London and then Sushruta reaches London in search of Michelle
 kahani main twist terns aate hai
 In the story of the film, on one side is Sushruta's father i
e
 Ram Kapoor and on the other side, Varina's father is Ronit
 parivaar donon ke pyaar main khadaa he
 Can Sushruta and Michelle get a pair? antat: kya hota he kis tarah kahani aage badhati hai iske liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 The writing of the film's weak sequel is quite weak
 khaastaur se screen play ghisa pita he
 It could be repaired
 debutent ke taur par aayush or varina aae to hai, lekin unhen acchhee kahani nahin mil pai he
 Because of this, nothing is seen "out of the box"
 saath hi saath nirdeshak kaa kaam bhi dhilaa he
 Abhiraj could have directed even better
 film kaa plat bahut acha tha
 a good story could have been made, but that thing could not be seen
 kalakaaron kaa abhinayafilm ke lokation or samvaad bhi ucch tareeke ke nahin he
 Because of this, the film starts to get weaker after the second half
 debyue film main aayush or varina ko acchhee script milti to ye acchhee film ho sakati thi
 What Abhiraj wanted to make did not appear in front of him
 film kaa bahut achche se pramotion kiya gaya
 But due to a weak film, the film will not get much benefit of aggressive promotion
 ek tareeke se kaaphi deele script vaali film he lavayatri
 Ayush and Varina have performed average
 film ke baaki kirdaar main chemiyo karte arbaj or sohail thik thaak lage hai
 Ram Kapoor and Ronitka's acting also seems somewhat right in its place
 film kii ek acchhee baat iske gane hai
 The songs have been hits before release

 Hence the controversy continues that governments are generally accepting the decisions of the collegium, but this time the Modi government returned asking the Chief Justice of Uttarakhand High Court Justice Joseph to reconsider the recommendation of the collegium to make it a judge of the Supreme Court

 Those analyzing the article feel that the Sangh wants to pressure the BJP or Kiran Bedi through it
 sangh kaa maananaa he ki dilli chunaav main bijepi jamini hakeekat se ghabaraai hui thi
 The BJP organization first took feedback from the people of Delhi
 orphir kiran bedi ko siem pad kaa ummidavaarbanaya
 Does the article in the Organizer mean that the BJP and Kiran Bedi will have to review their work again? On January 18, three days after joining the BJP, the party announced Kiran Bedi as the Chief Ministerial candidate
 tab sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ke naaraaz hone kii khabaren bhi ain thi
 But just four days after this, Kiran Bedi had read songs in praise of the Sangh
 unhone sangh ko rashtravaadi sanghathan bataaya tha
 It was said that the Sangh has tied the country in unity
 bedi ke is bayaan ko sangh ko saadhane kii koshish ke rup main dekha gaya
 Actually, Bedi joined the saffron party, but he has many things that the Sangh does not like
 masalan
 
 
 1
 kiran bedi kaa sangh se koi naata nahin he
 In contrast, she has been one of Team Anna's strategists
 2
 The central leadership of the BJP bypassed several BJP leaders associated with the Sangh and made him the chief ministerial candidate
 bijepi main andrunitaur par unke khilaaf maahaul bana hua he
 3
 bhaajapa netaaon ko kaam karne kii shiksha sangh kii paathshaala main hi milti he, lekin bedi ke kaam karne kaa andaaj ab bhi pulisia he
 In such a situation, there is no coordination between the two
 4
 Most of the big leaders or candidates for chief ministerial posts working in the BJP organization come to the party only through the Sangh
 unhen party kii niti or disha kaa achche se gyaan hota he
 But this is nothing to do with Kiran Bedi5
 65 saal kii kiran bedi ne lokseva main bhale hi jivan khapaaya ho, lekin raajnneeti ko lekar unki kamjor pakad dikhaai detii he
 6
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan kiran bedi vipakshiyon ko kargar jawaab de paane main asafal najar aa rahi he
 The Sangh is eyeing both BJP and Bedi
 orgeniser ke is lekh main unhone kiran bedi ko lekar bhale bijepi kii khinchaai kii he, lekin dabaav kiran bedi par bhi banaaya he
 Time is up, they do something

 drushti ne chitthee main likhaa, 'suraksha bal mujhe andar jane nahin de rahe hai
 When you receive this letter, call me on my number or send someone and let me in
 main aapkaa intervyuu lenaa chaahati hum
 'chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis wrote about this on his Facebook page,' i was happy and i was surprised to see the letter from the girl
 maine use apane karyaalay bulaayaa
 About the interview with the girl, Fadnavis wrote, "he asked me questions like a professional journalist
" usne poocha ki main shiksha ke kshetra ke liye kya kuch karuunga
 What will our government do about inflation? mujhe is intervyuu main kaaphi majaa aayaa
 Our government will definitely make efforts for the vision and better future of other children

 There were many press conferences on Tuesday in connection with the Vyapam scam
 lekin bhopal kii press conference isaliye yaad kii jaaegi kyonki kendriya mantri narendra singh tomars kii bagal main wo shaks baithe the jinka naam ek iskar kii red main saamne aayaa tha
 If you look at the big picture, the relationship between Red and Vyapam in 2013 seems to be linked
 ye mahaj sanyog kaise ho saktaa he ki iskar ke chaape ke dauraan jo diary or dastauez mili usamen un sab logon ke saath baatcheet kaa byora he jo yaa to vyaapman main jail ke andar hai yaa phir baahar apni baari ko lekar saansat main hai
 The main character of this entire story is Sudhir Sharma, who was a teacher just 10 years ago, and on seeing this, he described himself as the highest tax payer in Bhopal
 isaki kismat khuli lakshmikant sharma ke saath sampark main aane par
 Laxmikant Sharma is a BJP leader, currently lodged in jail along with Sudhir
 vyaapman ghotaale main in donon kaa rishta bhi dilachasp he
 Laxmikant's licensed revolver came out of Sudhir's house during the Income Tax Raid
 lakshmikant sharma, rajya main pehle khanan mantri or baad main ucch shiksha mantri bane
 Their relationship was very good with the union leader Suresh Soni
 ye rishton kaa jaal hi he jisamen saare vyaapman or duusare ghotaalon ke raaj chhipe hai
 It is said that wherever Laxmikant reached, Sudhir tried his luck and made fun of him
 pehle lakshmikant khanan mantri bane to sudhir sharma mining king ban gayi
 And then when Laxmikant became the Minister of Higher Education, the business started there too
 tippaniyan It has been found from the things that came in the Income Tax raid that Sudhir Sharma was taking care of all those people who were either his assistants or new positions in politics
 masalan bijepi ke tab ke adhyaksh jinhone sudhir ko party main padon se nawaaza
 a small part of Sudhir's income was being spent on the management of the people, this is also clear from the income tax papers
 jisamen sangh ke suresh soni se lekar bijepi saansad anil dave tak shaamil hai
 So were only Sudhir Sharma, Laxmikant and a few officers involved in this loot? Or are we just watching a part of the story? The Vyapam scam has come to the fore, but should we not reverse this story now? Shouldn't it be seen that if such a huge racket was prepared while living in the Education Department, how would there not have been games in the Ministry of Mining? Were there no part of the loot system from officer to Sudhir? Did only Sudhir hit the hand in mining or did another Surma Dilip Suryavanshi also grow rapidly during that time? agar badi pikchar dekhen to 2013 main hui red or vyaapman ke rishte judate dikh rahe hai
 How can it be a mere coincidence that the diary and documents found during the Income Tax Raid contain the details of conversations with all those people who are either inside the prison in Vyapam or are out of breath with their turn
 is puri kahani ke mukhya kirdaar kii bhoomika main sudhir sharma he jo mahaj 10 saal pehle ek teacher tha or dekhte hi dekhte khud ko bhopal main sabase zyada iskar chukaane vaala bataane laga
 Its fate was openly in contact with Laxmikant Sharma
 lakshmikant sharma bijepi ke netaa hai, philhal sudhir ke saath hi jail main band hai
 The relationship of these two in Vyapam scam is also interesting
 ek duusare se itane madhur sambandh the ki lakshmikant kii licency revolver iskar red ke dauraan sudhir ke ghar se nikali
 Laxmikant Sharma became the first Minister of Mining in the state and later the Minister of Higher Education
 unke rishte sangh netaa suresh soni se kaaphi achche the
 This is the network of relationships in which the secrets of all business and other scams are hidden
 kaha jaataa he ki lakshmikant jahaan-jahaan pahunche vahaan-vahaan sudhir ne kismat aajamaai or vaare nyaare kar daale
 First Laxmikant became Mining Minister, Sudhir Sharma became Mining King
 or phir jab lakshmikant ucch shiksha mantri bane to vahaan bhi vyaapman kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 The comments iskar ke chaape main ai baton se pataa lag rahaa he ki sudhir sharma un tamaam logon kaa khyaal rakh rahaa tha jo uske yaa to sahaayak the yaa phir raajnneeti main naye pad pratishtha dene vaale the
 For example, the then BJP President, who awarded Sudhir posts in the party
 sudhir kii kamai kaa ek chota sa hissaa logon ke management par kharch ho rahaa tha, ye bhi ab iskar ke kaagazon se saaf he
 From Suresh Soni of the Sangh to BJP MP Anil Dave
 to kya is lut main sirf sudhir sharma, lakshmikant or ikkaa dukka adhikari log shaamil the? yaa phir ham kahani kaa sirf ek hissaa dekh rahe hai? vyaapman kaa ghotaalaa to saamne aa gaya lekin kya hamen is kahani ko ab reverse karke nahin dekhnaa chaiye? kya ye nahin dekhnaa chaiye ki agar shiksha vibhaag main rahete huye itani bada racket taiyaar hua to khanan mantralay main kaise kaise khel nahin huye honge? kya vahaan afasar se lekar sudhir tak lut tantra kaa hissaa nahin the? kya sirf sudhir ne khanan main haath maaraa yaa duusare ek or suurama dilip suryavanshi bhi usee dauraan teji se bade?

 The committee submitted its report to the Finance Minister in December

 ) Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that talking about Jungle Raj in Bihar is an attempt to discredit Bihar
 ghatnaayen kahaan nahin hoti hai, lekin bihar ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 Tejashwi also spoke about his work on the occasion, as well as his relationship with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 tejasvi aapako jo mantralay mila he usamen kya-kya apane kaam kiya he? kya-kya aapaki praathamiktaayen hai?tejasvi yadav- jo mujh ko mantralay mila he vah infrastracchar se sambandhit he
 Construction in Bihar should be the best world class
 bihar main acchhee se acchhee sadaken dena, fliover bananaa yah hamaari twanti-20 plan kaa hissaa he
 So that people can get good roads
 nitish kumaar ke saath kaam karnaa kitna aasaan he yaa kitna mushkil?tejasvi yadav- dekhen mushkil kyon hoga
 The Chief Minister, like the Guardian, has got to learn work under his leadership
 samay-samay par suzav bhi miltaa rahata he, baatcheet bhi hoti rahati he, kaam karne ko lekar hamaara koardination bahut behatar chal rahaa he
 Can you talk to Nitish openly? There is no Heditation? Tejashwi Yadav- Not a Heditation, as i have been watching him since childhood
 mere fadar ke saath jepi andolan main unhone saath kaam kiya he
 We talk openly on all issues
 kaaphi kuch seekhney ko bhi miltaa he
 Questions also arise regarding law and order
 Are frequent incidents happening in Bihar? Should there be robbery, rape incidents, murders? What is the reason that Jungraj is being called again and again? Tejashwi Yadav- Who is saying this? bijepi ke log hai or to koi nahin
 Prime Minister also came to Bihar at the time of elections
 vahajangalrajkah rahe the, lekin janata ne kya mandet diya
 The public knows everything, not saying anything does not matter
 ghatana desh main kahaan nahin hoti
 Happens in Delhi
 vahaan to puraa mantrimandal baithta he, pradhanmantri baithte hai phir bhi ghatnaayen hoti hai
 Although i am not justifying the events of Bihar
 aisi ghatnaayen nahin honi chahie
 Our government is trying not to have such incidents
 lekin vahaan par ham log turant karrwai karte hai baaki jagah karrwai nahin hoti
 There are some people whom the people of Bihar did not give mandate, they try to discredit Bihar
 bihar ke liye centre sarkaar ne kya kiya
 What happened to the special package that was talked about? bihar se centre main saat-saat mantri hai, unhone kya kiya bihar ke liye
 As far as prohibition of liquor is concerned, Nitish went to UP
 vahaan virodh ho gaya samaajawaadee party ne kaha ki apana pradesh sanbhaalein? jitna samarthan vah chaahate the itnaa samarthan unako nahin mil paa rahaa he?tejasvi- upi chhodie naa
 What is there in Gujarat gujarat main purnasharabbandihai

 British MP Alok Sharma may have rejected the Government of India's campaign to return to Kohinoor during his visit to India, but the Government of India will continue its efforts in this regard
 is bare main kootnithik str par bhi or donon deshon kii sarkaron ke str par bhi baatcheet jari rahegi
 According to government sources, it is incorrect to say that India has no legal basis for calling back Kohinoor based on the United Nations Declaration
 jabaki bharat ke paas kanoonee aadhaar or daleelein bhi hai lekin shaayad uskaa istemaal philhal karne kii jarurat nahin padegi
 The option for the summit is also to be discussed further with the Prime Minister's Office as well as several other ministries related to the issue such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Culture, according to sources in the Ministry of Culture
 abhi to is maamle ko prabhaavshaalee tareeke se aage tak le jane ke tareekon par charchaa ho rahi he
 Among them, the talk will be carried forward at the top diplomatic level
 iske alaava donon deshon kii sarkaron ke bich shikhar vaarta bhi ek vikalp he
 If the investigation takes place, the truth will be revealed as far as Britain's argument is that India has no legal basis to demand Kohinoor back
 is par bharat sarkaar ke sutron kaa kahana he ki kohinoor waapas laane kii damdaar daleelein or majboot kanoonee aadhaar bhi hamaare paas hai
 But it will be used as another option when the time comes
 sanyukt raashtra ke jis dastavej kii baat kii ja rahi he usamen kai kanoonee pench hai
 In what circumstances, under pressure from 13-year-old Raja Dalip Singh of contemporary Punjab, Nekohinur Hirasurand, contemporary British rule, has not been disclosed yet
 isaki bhi padtaal hogi to sachai saamne aegi
 There are many such legal and historical points on which cross-examination will take place in international court, India will keep its side firmly
 lekin bharat chahta he ki isaki naubat hi nahin aaye
 The Government of India will bring back its heritage from other countries as well
 In this whole matter, the Government of India hopes that there will be positive talks on the issue of Kohinoor with the new Prime Minister of Britain, Theresa May
 samskruti mantralay ke sutron ne ye bhi sanket die hai ki supreme court main kohinoor kii vaapasi ko lekar vichaaradhin janhit yachika kii agali sunwaayee ke dauraan bharat sarkaar nayaa halafanama dekar apni manshaa saaf kar degi
 The government will tell in that at what level are the efforts to bring Kohinoor back from Britain
 ye alag baat he ki kuch maheene pehle centre sakaar ne supreme court main halafanama dekar kohinoor vaapasi kii muhim se haath khadey kar diye the
 But now the government is working hard to bring not only this but many countries to return their historical heritage back to India
 kai jagah kamyaabi hasil bhi hui he
 But for now, the biggest challenge is the return of Kohinoor

 The World Trade Organization (WTO) opens the way for the implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA)
 bharat va america ne bhartiya kisaanon ke hiton ko surakshit rakhte hue khaadya-suraksha ke mudde par gatirodh ko dur kar liya he
 The US has agreed to support India's proposal on the issue of food grains storage
 ab ise dablutio kii aam parishad main anumodan ke liye bheja jayega, jisase vyapaar sugamawa qaraar par dastakhat ho saken
 The agreement has been stuck for months

 He said that this would prepare the WTO for more successes
 iske saath hi sitaraman ne bharosa jataayaa ki sadsy dablutio main is maamle ko rachanaatmak bhaavana ke saath aage lekar jaaenge
 The minister further said that many countries have considered India's approach to the WTO appropriate and the US has also appreciated it
 ab america ne khulkar saarvajanik khadyann bhandaaran par hamaari chintaa kaa samarthan kiya he
 Sitharaman said, India has never hindered trade facilitation
 ham sirf apane kisaanon ke hiton kaa sangrakshan chaahate hai
 The Commerce Minister said that the WTO General Council would get India's proposal and the US would support us
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii america yatra ke baad bharat ke rukh ko lekar samaj behatar ho pai
 Sitharaman tweeted several times, saying India is a strong supporter of the multilateral trading system and we are committed to strengthening it further

 He also said that the trade system between some countries cannot replace the multilateral system and it is against the basic principle of transparency and inclusivity of the WTO
 haal main dablutio ke kuch sadasyon ne suzav diya tha ki yadi kuch sadasyon ke bich matbhed hai to kuch anya deshon main vyapaar samjhauta ho saktaa he
 India had made it clear that it could not support TFA until a permanent solution to the food subsidy issue, under which the global customs norms were to be relaxed
 bharat ne dablutio se kaha ki vah krishi sabsidi ke akalan ke liye mandandon main sanshodhan kare taaki desh bina dablutio ke mandandon ke ulanghan ke kisaanon se nunatam samarthan mulya par anaaj kii kharid kar use sasti dar par garibon ko bechnaa jari rakh sake
 According to the current WTO norms, food subsidy should cover up to 10 percent of the value of total food grain production, although the amount of subsidy is calculated based on the price two decades ago
 ashanka he ki jab bharat apane khaadya suraksha kaarykram ko lagu karegaa to yah seemaa kaa ulanghan kar saktaa he
 Amid settling the issue, Sitharaman said, "we supported the Bali package, but with the subsequent developments defying hope, India had no choice but to fix the process
" unhone kaha, isliye bharat ne yah rukh apanaaya ki jab tak hamaari samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hota vyapaar sugamawa qaraar ke liye sanshodhan (protocol of amendament) prakriya par sahmati jataana mushkil hoga
 The minister said, "we are very happy that India and the United States have successfully resolved the differences related to the matter of public storage for food security in the WTO in such a way that our problem is resolved
" unhone kaha, isse dablutio main gatirodh khatm ho jayega or vyapaar sugamawa qaraar lagu karne kaa rasta bhi khulegaa
 Sitharaman said, we are confident that the member countries will pursue this matter positively in the WTO
 yah dablutio kaa mahatvapurn yogadan hoga, jisase vikaas ke prati patibaddhta jaahir hoti he
 He said, "we appeal to the members of the WTO to take this matter forward in the General Council on behalf of the Ministerial Conference
" isse dablutio ko or aisi safalataa praapt karne ke liye protsaahit karne kaa rasta saaf hoga

 Party people understand who is wrong and who is right
 aap kyon chunaav nahin lard rahe hai?pehle main laduya chahta tha
 In Hamirpur, it was proposed to me that i should contest from Bundelkhand, there was a demand from the party leaders that there was no Chief Minister from Bundelkhand so i should contest from there

 We both have the same age, they have seen the world and i too
 duniya main duusare mulk aage bad gaye hai, ab ham bhi yah sapana dekh sakate hai ki hamaara pradesh bhi aage bade or log khushhaal ho jaaen
 What did the Congress gain from the alliance? It is not a matter of what the Congress gave, what did not
 gathbandhan se logon ke man main yah baat ai he ki ye log milakar acha sochenge
 BJP is saying that it is a coalition of clans, so i say it is a coalition of two young people

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is attacking your government for law and order
 
 
 pradhanmantri kah rahe hai ki sabase zyada rape or dange uttar pradesh main hue hai
 What is the definition of a riot? Have to find this out
 do community ke bich jhagade ko bhi ye danga maan rahe hai
 i also ask that you have been in power at the Center for two and a half years, how did you help UP on the issue of law and order? The previous central government of the UPA also used to pay for the modernization of the police, which they abolished
 hamane police ke rispance ko badhaane ke liye vishwa kii atyaadhunik ''upi-100" yojana rajya ke paise ke boote shuru kii he
 The Prime Minister should take a walk on the agra-lucknow Expressway

 The SP government has done the work of farmers
 ganna kisaanon kaa bhugtan us vakt karaayaa tha, jab chini milon ke saamne sankat tha
 Today, 95 percent sugar mills have paid the farmers
 desh main kam rajya honge, jo ganne kii keemat 280 rupye prati quintal de rahe honge
 The Prime Minister is saying that no blood pressure can be administered in Medanta Hospital
 unhen pataa hona chahie ki privet aspataal ko jameen di jaati he, aspataal ve khud banaate hai
 The SP government has built many medical colleges
 kisi bhi sarkari aspataal main pradhanmantri bladpressure napava sakate hai
 After the election, all BJP leaders will need to get blood pressure measured
 jis din log metro main chalanaa shuru karenge, us din ham pradhanmantri ko jarur bulaayenge
 Do you think that the BJP can raise the Hindutva or temple issue in protest against your work? Whatever they do, people are not listening to them

 This makes them angry
 pradhanmantri ''scam" naam kaa jumala oochaal kar kehete hai ki samaajawaadee party, congress, akhilesh or mayawati se pradesh ko bachaana he
 We say that "scam" means "save country from Amit Shah and Modi"
 mayawati ne chunaav main aapse adhik muslim ummidavaaron ko utaara he
 Will this not harm your party? The bsp's strategy is to shatter the Muslim vote in some way
 mayawati ji bijepi kii madad kar rahi hai
 These Muslims are also understanding
 ve bakhubi jaanate hai ki kise vot dena he
 What is the cut of Mayawati's Dalit vote bank? The Constitution has provided reservation for Dalits
 to hamaari har yojana main unki madad ho rahi he
 i am giving socialist pension to 55 lakh women
 yani aabaadi ke hisaab se usamen bhi 27 fisadi dalit honge
 We are giving 500 rupees a month to Dalit women
 yah mayawati ji ne kabhi nahin diya hoga
 When i distributed food in Bundelkhand, the poor were the most dalits

 i have fulfilled the promises i made
 ''achche din" hamaara nahin unka slogan he
 They are unable to answer

 ve ek aam kaaryakarta hai or ham saansad aise main unhen hamase aakar milanaa chahie
 '' manoj ne ye bhi kaha ki, ''hamen ek thanedaar kii zaroorat nahin he, balki ek vinamr netaa kii zaroorat he jo sabko saath lekar chal sake
 "he further said," i did not like the way he talked to the party workers a few days ago, i was not present there but i got the same response from the workers
 '' After this reaction of Manoj Tiwari, angry Kiran Bedi spoke to the party leadership, after which Manoj Tiwari was summoned
 unase ravivaar ko bedi kii chaay-party main nahin pahunchane ke bhi kaaran puche gaye
 By warning Tiwari, the party has in a way tried to send a message to all those people who have been resentful inside since Bedi came to the party

 The comments of the leaders show how desperate the leadership itself is on the continuing suicides by farmers in Maharashtra and the deteriorating conditions of the agriculture sector
 shanivaar ko vidarbha ke akola main hui ek kisaan sangoshtee main akola ke bijepi saansad sanjay dhotre ne aise hi ek bayaan main hataash hokar kisaanon ko unheen haal par chhod dene tak kii baat kah daali
 Expressing frustration over the state of the agriculture sector, Dhotre said, "traditional farming on one side and Bt seeds on the other side are being narrated to the farmers
 
 
 is mili-juli jaankaree se kisaan bhi utane hi bauraye hue hai, jitne anek doctoron ke sujhaavon se mariz baukhalaataa he
 
 
 This is a dilemma for 35 years, and no one knows
 
 
 dhanwaan kisaanon kii yah haalat he to garib kisaanon kii kya haalat hogi
 
 
 Farmers likewise have little information
 
 
 mujhe to lagata he ki hamaari nitiyaan hi kisaanon kaa sabase bada sankat he
 
 
 i even say angrily, farmers are not aware, let them die
 
 
 jinhen kisaani kerani he, karenge hi
 
 
 Whatever is to be will be through
 
 
 " Maharashtra's Vidarbha division has the highest number of farmer suicides in Maharashtra, but it is here that Akola MP Sanjay Dhotre selected the words where many were exasperated, Maharashtra Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse made another statement in a clean manner, but here too Became more complicated than khadse ne kaha, kisaan aatmahatyaon ko rokane ke liye tarah-tarah ke package ghoshit kiye ja chuke hai, lekin aatmahatyaayein rukii nahin hai
 No one knows the way to stop farmer suicides, but we have to see that the farmers are encouraged
 bijepi netaaon ke in bayanon par ensipi aakraamak ho uthi he
 NCP spokesman Nawab Malik, who handled the Ministry of Agriculture during the UPA regime, termed the BJP as anti-farmer
 malik ne enditivi se kaha, bijepi khud ko kisaan hitaishi kahe, lekin uske krishi sambandhit nirnyon se kisaanon ko nuksaan hi ho rahaa he
 However, NCP has also been in dispute with controversial statements related to farmers
 ensipi netaa or maharashtra ke purv dipti siem ajit pavaar ne rajya ke sookhe baandhon ke bharne ko lekar ek abhadra tippanee par tab ke vipaksh ne tikhaa hamalaa bolaa tha
 The lack of compassion towards the farmers despite the change in power in Maharashtra makes us think that even if the power changes, the faces of the leaders change, the leaders hardly change

 maharashtra main haal ke dinon main uttar bharatiyon, khaas taur par bihar se aae logon par hamale kii ghatnaayen badi hai
 Activists of Raj Thackeray's party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) targeted north Indians earning livelihood by setting up shop or hawking on footpaths in different areas of Mumbai
 sangli main bhi isi tarah kaa hamalaa hua
 For the past few years, such incidents had come to a halt in Maharashtra, including Mumbai
 achaanak aisa kya hua ki MNS ne phir is tarah ke hamale tej kar die hai
 Phool Singh, president of the Bhartiya Ekta Manch, a non-resident of Mumbai, has written an open letter to Raj Thackeray condemning the action of MNS
 is chitthee main kaha gaya he ki agar bihar yaa uttar pradesh ke logon kii pitayee se maharashtra ke logon ko naukari milti he to ve unase pitane ke liye taiyaar hai
 The JDU-BJP alliance led by Nitish Kumar is a government in Bihar these days
 aise main maharashtra se bihar or uttar pradesh ke logon par hamale kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 When Nitish Kumar left the BJP and joined hands with Lalu Prasad and the Congress in 2013, the MNS or Shiv Sena in Mumbai had never done any such act against the people of Bihar except in isolated incidents
 ye kisi se chupa nahin he ki MNS or shivasena, donon hi apni kshetravaad kii raajnneeti ko chamakaane ke liye ateet main uttar bharatiyon ko nishaanaa banaate rahe hai
 Recently, when such attacks happen again, questions have started to arise in the political corridors of Bihar that whenever the BJP is in power in Bihar, why the attacks on people of Bihar in Maharashtra increase
 jediu ke pravaktaa niraj kumaar kehete hai, 'maharashtra main bijepi kii sahyogi shivasena he or wo roj apane akhbaar ‘saamana’ main bijepi ke khilaaf jehar ugalati he
 MNS has the same condition
 ve hindutv ke saath-saath marathi votaron ko lubhaane kii ranneeti ke tahat ye sab karte he
 In such a situation, BJP needs introspection
 'mumbai main bihar or uttar pradesh ke logon ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he or ittefaq se in donon rajyon main hi bijepi satta main he
 BJP does not believe that Indians are being targeted in Maharashtra due to their governments being in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 bihar main bijepi ke emelsi deveshchandra thakur kaa kahana he ki mumbai main is baar ke hamale utar bharatiyon par hamale nahin hai
 This is being misrepresented
 mumbai main rahane vaale thakur kaa maananaa he- 'mahanagar main elfinston over brij haadase ke baad is tarah kii baaten saamne ain ki pheriwaalon kii vajah se logon kaa aise brijon par chalanaa mushkil he
 Regarding this, the MNS was told that the ferrymen would be removed from such places
 isamen keval utar bhartiya pheri vaale nahi dakshin bhartiya or marathi bhi hai
 'deveshchandra Thakur also said that since the Bihar Keshtabdi year celebrations in 2012, the incidents of attacks on people of Bihar in Mumbai or Maharashtra had almost ceased
 lekin sawaal ye uthta he pheriwaalon ko hataane kaa adhikaar MNS ko kisne diya he? kya in pheriwaalon ke liye sarkaar kii ore se koi vaikalpik vyavastha nahi kii ja sakati he?mumbai main apravasi utar bhartiya ekta manch ke adhyaksh phool singh ne raaj thakare ke naam khuli chitthee main likhaa he ki agar uttar bharatiyon kii pitayee se maharashtra ke logon ko naukari yaa rojgaar miltaa he to ve unase pitane ke liye taiyaar hum
 Phool Singh has written that Raj Thackeray will come and beat him on Juhu on October 27 and give jobs to 10 Marathas, i am ready for this

 After Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, now Railway and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal also trolled badly on social media for his statement
 nirmala sitaraman ke auto sector main mandi ke liye ola or ubar ko jimmedaar maanane ke baad ab piyush goyal ek galati kar baithe or gravity (gurutvkarshan) kii khoj ke liye albert oinstin kaa naam le liya
 Goyal trolled on social media for this mistake
 desh kii arthvyavastha par bolte hue kendriya rail mantri piyush goyal ne apane sambodhan main kaha ki arthvyavastha ko sanbhaalane ke liye kisi bhi tarah ke ganit yaa usase jude aankadon ko dekhne kii jarurat nahin he, agar oinstin is ganit main ulajh jate to ve kabhi bhi gravity (gurutvkarshan) kii khoj nahin kar pate
 He said, 'do not go into those accounts which you see on TV
 agar aap 5 trillian kii arthvyavastha hasil karnaa chaahate hai, to desh ko kareeb 12% kii dar se aage badhanaa hoga jabaki aaj yah 6 fisadi kii dar se bad rahi he

 The Supreme Court on Monday warned that after the death of one of its associates, it would take strict action against the hooliganism of lawyers who sabotaged the Allahabad hospital and prohibited the arrest of some doctors accused of medical negligence
 sheersh nyaayalay ne jivan jyoti aspataal kii kathith laaparvaahee se vakil lakshmi kaant mishra kii maut se judi ghatana par elahabaad ucch nyaayalay main chal rahi kaarywahi par bhi roak laga di
 The lawyer was taken to the hospital on February 2 after suffering a serious injury in a road accident
 nyaayamurti markandeya katju or deepak verma kii avkaash peeth ne kaha vakil gundgardee main lipt nahin ho sakate
 We will deal with this strictly
 ham unhen hosh main laaenge
 The apex court regretted that some lawyers stopped and beat up other lawyers who had come on behalf of the aggrieved doctors
 peeth ne kaha aap aisi gundgardee nahin kar sakate
 If you have courage, do this in front of the Supreme Court and then we will show you

 In his plea in the court, Bansal said that despite best medical efforts, Mishra died in the hospital as he had septicemia
 aspataal ne daawa kiya ki najuk haalat main laaye jane ke baad lakshmi kaant mishra kaa aspataal main 59 din ilaaj chalaa or mrityu se pehle vah coma main chale gayi
 However, after the incident, several lawyers entered the hospital and vandalized the premises and beat up staff and patients in the hospital
 police main ipisi kii dhara 302 ke tahat maamla daayar karne ke saath mishra ke bhai ne aapraadhik maamla darj karne ke liye elahabaad ucch nyaayalay main ek rit yachika bhi daakhil kii thi
 The petition alleged that when advocate JS Sengar appeared on behalf of Bansal, he was beaten up and the lawyers barred others from appearing for doctors in the High Court
