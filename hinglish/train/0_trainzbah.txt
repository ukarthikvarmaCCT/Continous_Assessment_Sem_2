 After the formation of SP government, they were pressurized to produce electricity from garbage

 In January 2001, the Ministry of Unconventional Energy Sources, in Vajpayee's parliamentary constituency Lucknow, spent about Rs 100 crore

 After this, the municipal corporation gave seven acres of land to the project for 30 years

 In November 2003, Asia Bio Energy, the company handling the project, returned 25 per cent of the garbage received by the plant as unusable
 ek saal ke bheetar anupayogi kooda 90 fisadi se zyada ho gaya or plant par taala lag gaya
 "this project to generate electricity from garbage was to run on biomethanation technology," says an official who supervised this dream project of Vajpayee

 desh ko aazaadee milane ke saat dashak baad bhi ek skool kii aisi tasviren tamaam shiksha vyavastha par tamaacha he
 In Mokalpura village of Manasa tehsil of Neemuch district, the primary school was established in the papers only in 2012, but even after five years, there was not even a room for children to read
 skool main pehali se chauthi kaksha tak ke kul 17 bachche padhate hai
 The school has a single teacher, Kailash Chandra Rathore, to teach them all
 saal bhar rathore khule main bacchon ko ped ke neeche padhaakar kaam chalaa lete hai, lekin barish ke dinon main aisa karnaa sambhav nahin ho paata
 Till two years ago, this school used to be in a mud house
 vahaan sanpon ne apana bill bana liya, to dar ke maare bacchon ne vahaan janaa chhod diya
 Teacher Rathore understands his responsibility very well
 isliye unki hameshaa yahi koshish rahati he ki bacchon kii padhai main koi baadha naa aae
 He also found a solution for the children to continue their studies during the rainy days
 gaanv main sarkari building ke naam par ek toilet kaa nirmaan ho rakhaa he, lekin yah toilet jis mul uddeshy ke liye banaaya gaya tha, uske liye kabhi shuru nahin ho sakaa
 In such a situation, this toilet was used as a children's school
 rathore kaa kahana he ki barish ke dinon main khule main bacchon ko padhaanaa khatre se khaali nahin he
 One is the risk of children getting sick, while there is also the possibility of biting poisonous creatures like snake-scorpion
 toilet main paathshaala chalane kaa ek video bhi soshal media par viral ho gaya
 In this video, the teacher can be heard saying that despite all requests from the authorities, arrangements could not be made for the construction of a room for the school in the village
 haalanki camere par shikshak rathore ne is vishay main zyada bolne se parhez kiya
 At the same time, the villagers do not get tired of praising Rathore
 unka kahana he ki rathore bacchon kii padhai se koi samjhauta nahin karte
 Whatever the circumstances, they definitely come to teach the children
 is maamle main manasa kii esadm vandana mehara se baat kii gai, to unhone bebaaki se sweekaar kiya ki gaanv menskulki building naa hone kii vajah se toilet main hi bacchon ko padhanaa pard rahaa he
 However, he also added that the construction for the toilet was never used as a toilet
 esadm ke mutabik gaanv kii aabaadi bahut kam he
 Earlier, the school was run in a kutcha house, but it was evacuated due to fear of poisonous animals
 esadm ne kaha ki vahaan 20 se kam bachche hai, jinhen paas ke skool main shift karne ke aadesh die gaye hai
 The humiliating defeat in the assembly elections of Delhi, the capital of the country, has troubled the BJP as well as the Sangh
 guuruuvaar ko dilli sthit sangh mukhyalay jhandevalaan main sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat, sarkarywah bhaiyyaji joshi, teenon sah sarkarywah krishna gopal, dattatreya hosbale or suresh soni ne taaja rajnatik halaat par gambhir mantranaa kii
 According to sources, the important agenda of this meeting was the issue of the All India House of Representatives meeting to be held in Nagpur on 13-15 March next month, but there was also a churn in the defeat of Delhi Assembly elections
 is baithak main sangh ne sabase pehle dilli main kaam kar rahe apane swayamsevakon se bijepi kii haar par jamini report maangi he to duusari taraf baithak main se hi bijepi ke sanghathan mahasachiv raamalaal ko phone kar dilli vidhansabha kii chunavi haar kii report dene kaa nirdesh diya
 The Sangh wants to understand what the BJP reports and what its volunteers have to say about this defeat
 haalanki 15 farvari ko bijepi or sangh kii samanvay samiti kii baithak bhi honi he jisamen sah sarkarywah krishna gopal, dattatreya hosbale ke saath modi sarkaar ke chaar bade mantri arun jetali, rajnath singh, nitin gadakari, sushamaa swaraj aadi shaamil honge
 BJP national president Amit Shah's son is still in doubt about his presence due to the wedding reception
 samanvay samiti kii baithak main khaas taur se dilli kii haar par charchaa hogi or uskaa nichod sangh pramukh ko ek praarambhik report ke taur par bheja jayega
 But the defeat of Delhi Assembly elections has made the Sangh so worried that it has decided to make an effective strategy in the All India House of Representatives meeting on this issue as well
 sutron kii maane to baithak main saaf taur par yah chintaa jaahir kii gai ki chunavi haar-jeet hoti rahati he lekin is tarah kii apmanjanak haar badi chintaa kii baat he kyonki is chunaav main bijepi ke saath-saath sangh ne abhi apni takat jhonk di thi
 Sources say that in the meeting of the House of Representatives, the Sangh will also consider such a far-reaching action plan so that such misfortunes do not happen in future

 bharat badal rahaa he, ab uttar pradesh kii baari he
 If you move from Delhi to West Uttar Pradesh, then this talk on the huge hoardings in the sugarcane fields on both sides of the highway draws your attention
 darasal, sarkari vikaas parv manaa rahi bijepi ne uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke liye isi ibaarat ko apana naaraa banaaya he
 And the first turn of the slogan came in Murana's riot in Kairana town of Shamli district
 shastreey sangeet kaa kiraanaa gharaana dene vaale kairana kasbe main 8 june tak jindagi aam ke baghichon kii khushboo, takizon main chalati 1990 ke dashak kii filmon or andar-baahar savaariyon se thasa-thas bhare tempuon main vilambit lay main chal rahi thi
 That's when BJP MP Hukum Singh, accused of the Muzaffarnagar riots, came out with a list, claiming that Hindus were fleeing from towns like Kairana and Kandhla for fear of Muslims
 ramajaan ke maheene main dinabhar thook tak na gatakane vaale rojedaar jab tak yah samaj pate ki aakhir unhone apane hindu bhaaiyon par itnaa julm kab kar diya, tab tak to baat puri duniya main fail chuki thi
 Kairana had become a laboratory for a new experiment of communal polarization
 21 june ko jab desh main vishwa yoga diwas kii dhooma thi tab is samvaadadaata ne is prayogshaala kaa jayja liya
 Tried to know which devices are being used here and where is their power supply from? In such a situation, when leaving the delhi-haridwar highway, the vehicle turned towards Kairana, then suddenly the traffic stopped in Shamli town
 pataa chalaa ki bazaar main din-dahaade kuch logon ne ek medical store sanchaalak par goliyaan chalaa deen
 Luckily, the businessman survived, but angry traders jammed the highway for several hours
 jaise-taise kairana pahunche to pataa chalaa ki ek vyakti ne police se shikaayat kii he ki badmaash usase do lakh ru
 Asking for extortion of pehali ghatana main peedit ek hindu tha or duusari main musalmaan
 Both these incidents may look like normal incidents of crime from above, but this weakness of law and order is being communally colored in Kairana, which is deprived of any employment possibilities other than farming and gardening
 teen saal peeche jaaen to mujffarnagar dangon ke pehle bhi ladakiyon se chhedchhad or motorcycle se takkar jaisi ghatnaon tak ko sampradayik rang de diya gaya tha
 And after that the situation was escalated to riots through mahapanchayats and rumors
 kahin is baar 'suchi bam' bhi ghaatak sabit na ho?es main sabase pehle kairana kotwali ke thik saamne electricals kii dukaan chalaane vaale aarif se mulaakaat kii
 His first reaction was, "you have come too late, till now the truth has come in front of everyone
" '' unki baat main dam he
 Till now, on one side there were reports that confirmed the migration of Hindus, and on the other side there were reports which said that the list of migration is a bundle of lies and where there is an escape, it is not communal
 khud bijepi ne bhi is maamle main dohari jubaan boli
 Hukum Singh, who released the list, later admitted that the matter was not communal harassment, but he also kept trying to give the case a communal color
 vahiin bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh keshav prasad maury ne ghoshnaa kii ki ab har jile main aisi suchiyaan banaai jaaengi
 That is, Kairana is just the beginning of bjp's Mission 265 Plus in Uttar Pradesh

 Here, one by one, many houses were locked, while on some houses it was written - The house is for sale
 jis makaan kii diwaar par 'bikaoo he' likhaa he, vah ek muslim sajjan kaa he
 One of the houses locked was of Pervez Alvi and Javed Alvi
 muhalle waalon ne bataaya ki ve log sarkari naukari main hai or lakhanu bas gaye hai
 Asif Alvi, who lives in an adjacent house, has settled in Jaipur and for years the son of Jalil Ahmed of the locked old mansion has settled in Delhi

 He is the first name among those who have escaped from the list of Hukum Singh

 Radheshyam Sharma, sitting on the stool, told, "once 300 people used to work in this firm, now there are not even 10-20 men
 gundgardee ke dar se mittal parivaar kairana chhod 28 kimi dur panipat satil ho gaya he, bas yahi dukaan bachi he
 Meanwhile, Mittal's son Nitin also came
 shuru main hichak ke baad unhone kaha, ''main yah nahin kah rahaa hum ki yah hindu-muslim maamla he, lekin aap dekhie ki pareshaan karne vaale koun hai or pareshaan hone vaale koun hai
 "but if we look at the lists of Kairana and Kandhla, there are names of many merchants of Colddrink in it
" ek vyapaaree ne bataaya ki sarkaar ne ek sahab ko rajyamantri kaa darja de rakhaa he
 His son has also opened Colddrink's agency
 baaki colddrink agenciyon kaa utpeeda kiya ja rahaa he
 That is to say, the case of harassment in political patronage and not communal harassment
 agar suchi main palaayan dikhaae jane ke baavjood mittal parivaar ab bhi kairana main kaarobaar kar rahaa he, to suchi main jhootha naam likhane par kaandhala ke gaurav jain ne dm ko patr likhakar suchit kiya ki unka makaan bikaoo nahin he or ve kahin nahin ja rahe
 The name of Sukhpal Saini of Kandhla countryside is also in the list of migration
 sukhpal ne yahaan se bidisi kaa chunaav bhi ladaa he
 His wife Darshan Devi was found at home
 unheen ke rishtedaar rajeev kumaar saini bhi palaayan suchi main naam hone ke baavjood electric upkarnon kii apni dukaan par baithe mili
 When asked Saini how he was named in the list, he said, "we will go to Bahadrabad in Roorkee
" '' unka kahana tha ki 2013 ke mujffarnagar dangon ke baad se unki dukaan kii bikri bahut ghat gai he
 Asked if someone occupied his house after he left? Saini of the strong Kadakathi said, "nobody has such courage
 '' yani bhale hi ve chale jaaen par bhaybheet nahin hai
 Apart from the exodus, the second issue here was also thrown up by the murder of Hindu traders
 yahaan lambey samay tak mubin giroh kaa aatank rahaa
 The gang had killed more than six Muslims besides three traders
 is khoonkhaar giroh ke chaar sadsy encounter main maare ja chuke hai, jabaki kareeb 24 sadsy jail main band hai
 On this issue, BSP leader Sajid Siddiqui says, "the entire Kairana was against the killing of traders
 kya us samay musalamaanon kii dukaane band nahin thim
 After what purpose is the two-year-old case now being taken up
 ''kairana vaale isaki ek vajah hukum singh kii rajnatik mahatvakankshaayen bhi maanate hai
 The Gujjar community is dominated by Kairana
 yahaan hindu or muslim donon tarah ke gurjar hai

 By that time he was the leader of the Khanty secular image

 The Supreme Court said- criticizing the work of the government, not treason, Bapu had told 124A that the sedition case has been closed against 49 intellectuals who wrote letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding mob lynching
 bihar police ne yah kehete hue is rajdroh ke maamle ko khaarij kar diya ki isamen koi sachai nahin he or in buddhijiviyon ke khilaaf rajdroh kaa cese nahin banataa he
 Since this incident, the debate about treason has started once again
 yah pehla mauka nahin he, jab rajdroh ko lekar puure desh main bahes chhidi hui he
 Earlier in the year 2016, there was a very strong debate about the sedition law
 angreji hukumat ke samay saal 1870 main bhartiya dand samhita yani ipisi kii dhara 124A jodakar rajdroh ko aparaadh banaaya gaya tha
 Mahatma Gandhi was also against the sedition law, the father of the nation, regarding the sedition law, Mahatma Gandhi had said that section 124A of the IPC is a law designed to suppress the freedom of citizens
 hindustan main rajdroh kaa cese pehali baar bal gangadhar tilak ke khilaaf chalaaya gaya tha
 Apart from this, the sedition law was fiercely misused by the British government to suppress the voice of all the freedom fighters including Mahatma Gandhi, Lala Lajpat Rai and Arvind Ghosh and create terror
 aazaadee ke baad bhi is kanoon kaa durupyog band nahin hua
 The ruling government used this law to suppress the voice of the common man
 yah kanoon shuruyaat se hi vivaadon main rahaa or ab tak vivaad main bana hua he
 What does the section of treason say? According to section 124A of the IPC, if a person writes, speaks, or in any other way creates hatred, enmity or contempt against the government established by law in India, he will be held guilty of treason
 iske liye teen varsh se lekar aaajeevan karawas tak kii sajaa or jurmaane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Is the Supreme Court verdict? Now the question arises on the sedition law, whether it is against the fundamental right to freedom of expression given to citizens under Article 19 (1) (A) of the Constitution? The answer was given by the Supreme Court in the case of Kedarnath Singh v
 State of Bihar
 is maamle main faisla sunaate hue supreme court kii paanch sadasyeey khandpeeth ne kaha tha ki sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kii aalochana karnaa rajdroh nahin hai
 If there is no violence, dissatisfaction or anarchy in the society from any speech or article, then it cannot be considered treason
 kisi ko hinsa yaa araajaktaa failane yaa phir kanoon vyavastha kharaab hone par hi ipisi kii dhara 124A ke tahat rajdroh kaa aaropee banaaya ja saktaa he
 However, the court refused to declare Section 124A of the IPC unconstitutional
 ab rajdroh ke maamalon ke aankade bhi jutaaye jane lage hai
 The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has started collecting data on sedition case since 2014

 visphot queta ke bulili kshetra main ek vaahan ke paas huaqueta ke spini road par somvaar ko bhi hua tha dhamaakaa BJP has nominated Sadhvi Pragya Thakur from Bhopal
 vah congress ke diggaj netaa digvijay singh ke khilaaf maidan main utari hai jinhone maalegaanv blast main sadhvi kaa naam aane ke baad ise bhagava aatankwaad kaa naam diya tha
 Digvijay Singh, who was the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, has been known for making sharp attacks on RSS and BJP
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha bhi he jo hindu aatankwaad shabd ke janmdata hai hamane unheen ke khilaaf sadhvi pragna thakur ko utaara he
 It is also being speculated that the way Uma Bharti overthrew Digvijay Singh's Congress government, will Sadhvi Pragya put an end to Digvijay's political aspirations
 kyonki sadhvi pragna or uma bharti main kai samanthaayen he
 Both are related to controversies
 donon kaa pahanava bhi ek hi tarah kaa he
 Uma Bharti was elected MP in 1999 from the same Bhopal from where Sadhvi Pragya has been made a candidate
 sadhvi pragna kii bhopal se ummidavaari ghoshit hone ke baad digvijay ne jin sadhe shabdon main unka swaagat kiya usase aisa lag rahaa he ki vah koi aisi baat nahin karnaa chaahate jisase sadhvi ko phayda mili
 It is believed that BJP has got the second firebrand leader in Madhya Pradesh after Uma Bharti
 digvijay singh kii kabhi congress main tuuti bolti thi vah 1993 se lekar 2003 tak lagaataar madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri rahe
 Before that, bjp's Sunderlal Patwa was the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh
 digvijay singh ne madhya pradesh congress adhyaksh rahete hue puure pradesh kii padayatra kii thi or bijepi ko satta se bedakhal karne main kaamyaab rahe the
 Similarly, Uma Bharti had also campaigned against the Congress and toured the entire state
 10 saal siem rahane ke baad ek sadhvi se digvijay singh haar gaye the
 After the arrival of Sadhvi Pragya from Bhopal, it is being speculated whether Digvijay will be defeated once again by Sadhvi or this time he will be able to save his existence? Sadhvi Pragya Thakur is also considered as a Fire brand leader As Uma Bharti has been considered
 uma bharti bhi bhagava vastra dhaaran karti hai or sadhvi pragna thakur kaa pahanava bhi thik vaisaa hi he
 Her identity is the garland of cut hair and, saffron robes and rudraksha in the neck
 uma bharti ne ghoshnaa kar di he ki vah is baar chunaav nahin ladengi aise main 48 saal kii sadhvi pragna thakur raajnneeti main bharti kii uttaradhikari bhi sabit ho sakati hai
 Uma Bharti was patronized by BJP strongman Vijayaraje Scindia and pushed her into politics
 uma bharti bhi bachapan se hi sangh se prabhavit raheen or baad main bijepi se saansad, vidhayak chuni gayi, usee tarah sadhvi pragna thakur kaa bhi sangh se purana naata he
 He has also worked in the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad
 pragna vishwa hindu parishad kii mahila shakha durga vahini se bhi judi rahi hai
 Uma Bharti has been educated up to class VI but Sadhvi Pragya has studied upto MA
 uma bharti 1999 main isi bhopal se saansad chuni gai thim jahaan se sadhvi pragna thakur ko maidan main utaara gaya he
 It was only after he was elected MP from Bhopal that the party decided that he alone had the ability to overthrow Digvijay's power
 iske baad bijepi ne unhen madhya pradesh kii jimmedaari saunp di thi
 In the 2003 assembly elections held in Madhya Pradesh, BJP got a two-thirds majority and Uma Bharti was made the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh
 unhone digvijay singh ko apdasth kar diya tha
 Uma Bharti has been associated with controversies
 She is known for her outrageous remarks
 adwani kaa virodh karne kii vajah se uma bharti ko party tak se nikaal diya gaya tha
 Uma Bharti gained a greater recognition after the demolition of the Babri Masjid
 isi tarah sadhvi pragna ko bhi prakhar vaktaa mana jaataa he
 Sadhvi Pragya gained recognition across the country after her name came up in the Malegaon blast
 aaj bhi special enie kii special court main trial chal rahaa he
 Uma Bharti is also accused in the Babri demolition case
 halaat badale hue hai
 Digvijay Singh is trying to get back his lost land
 unhone jab saansad kaa chunaav ladane kii ichha vyakt kii thi to empi ke siem kamalnath ne kaha tha ki agar digvijay singh chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai to unhen koi kathin seat chunani chahie
 Bhopal and Indore are considered to be the most difficult seats for the Congress
 bhopal main aakhri baar 1984 main congress kaa saansad chunaa gaya tha
 From 1989 to 2014, BJP continued to win from here
 aise main digvijay ne bhopal kii chunauti sweekaar kii
 Political experts believe that if Digvijay Singh wins this battle, bringing him into the mainstream will be the compulsion of the party
 lekin agar sadhvi pragna thakur se haar jate hai to phir unhen apni jameen hasil karne ke liye or kathin mehnat kerani hogi
 Digvijay is 72 years old
 aise main unke liye yah chunaav or mahatvapurn ho jaataa he
 It is certain that Sadhvi Pragya will surround Digvijay on the issue of Hindutva
 bhopal se tikat pakkaa hone ke baad unhone yah kaha bhi ki bhartiya samskruti par daag lagane waalon ke khilaaf vah puure dam se ladengi
 Digvijay Singh, however, refrained from commenting hard on him

 ' The Congress has targeted the Modi government over the death of 39 Indians in Mosul and said that the government has misled the country
 congress ne 39 bharatiyon kii maut par dukh prakat kiya, magar saath hi modi sarkaar ko aade haathon liya
 Randeep Singh Surjewala, in charge of the Congress Media Department, has accused the government that the Modi government has crossed all limits of insensitivity, ruthlessness and ruthlessness
 surajevaala ne kaha ki 39 bharatiyon ko surakshit waapas naa laa paane kii jimmedaar modi sarkaar he
 Why was the Modi government claiming 39 Indians alive till now? Surjewala said, '39 Indians were abducted in June 2014
 puraa vishwa or padosi desh is baat kii pushti kar rahe the ki 39 bhartiya ab jivit nahin he, parantu bharat sarkaar ne 23 june 2014, 9 july 2014, 17 july 2014, 24 july 2014, 6 agast 2014, 22 july 2015 or 16 july 2017 yani saat baar desh or39 bharatiyon caparivarajanon ko ye kaha ki wo sab jinda hai
 They even said that they are alive and they are getting all the facilities they need
 ''isse pehle maut kii report ko sire se khaarij kiya gaya'surajevaala ne sawaal uthaaya he ki modi sarkaar, videsh mantralay auravidesh mantri sushamaa swarajdesh ko gumraah kyon kar rahe the, parivarajanon ko gumraah kyon kar rahe the? jab bharat kaa media apni jaan jokhim main daal kar july, 2017 main iraq ke mosul gaya or unhone report kiya ki hindustan ke 39 naagarik jivit nahin hai, tab bhi sushamaa swaraj ji or modi sarkaar ne use sire se khaarij kar diya tha
 When an eyewitness came to the notice and he also said that 39 Indians were murdered by ISI militants, he also dismissed them outright
 videsh mantri kaa bayaan sharmnaak he: surajevaalamodi sarkaar neyah tak kaha ki iraq ke pradhanmantri jab bharat aaenge to unase puch kar is puri baat kii pushti kii jaaegi, par kiya kuch nahin
 The question is: Why was Modi government and Sushma Swaraj throwing dust in the eyes of the country and those families? The most unfortunate thing is that Foreign Minister Sushma is saying this today - the patience of the dead comes
 surajevaala ne pradhanmantri modi or sushamaa se kaha ki jab beete kai varshon se besabri se intjaar karte wo parivarajan jab til-til 39 bharatiyon kii yaad main har roj marate the, to kya aapako unka kabhi khyaal aayaa? jab wo ek darjan baar videsh mantri se milane aae, nyaay kii guhaar, parivarajanon ko waapas laane kii guhaar karne aae, tab bhi aapane unako sach nahin bataaya? or aap hamen kah rahe hai ki congress party raajnneeti kar rahi he
 It cannot be more shameful to say that 39 families are patient, more shameful for those 39 families
 congress ne bataai sushamaa ke sansad main bayaan or press vaarta kii vajahasurajevaala ne kaha ki baat yahaan khatm nahin hoti
 39 Indians died and the External Affairs Minister is still patting the government on the back, thanking the Prime Minister and his colleague
 kis baat kaa dhanyavad ki bharat kii sarkaar 39 bharatiyon kii jindagi nahin bachaa pai or 4 saal tak unke parivarajanon or desh ko gumraah karti rahi? is baat kaa dhanyavad? or aaj hadabadi main jab sansad ke donon sadanon ke andar videsh mantri ji bayaan detii hai, press vaarta pehle rakhti hai or ye bataanaa bhul jaati hai ki ye hadabadi kahin is vajah se to nahin thi ki iraq kii Martyrs Foundation ne aaj bhartiya samay ke anusaar dopaher ke baad ek patrkaar vaarta rakhkar 39 bharatiyon ke jivit naa hone kii sari sachai duniya ke saamne rakhane kaa nirnay liya tha
 i was also told and check the time that at two and a half hours today, he has exposed all this truth in a press conference and when it was felt that the poll would open, then you gave this statement in haste
 jab no confidence aa gaya to aapane ye bayaan de daalaa
 Informing of the deaths of 39 Indians on TV, family members said, "at least the Indians who are not among us should not have politics on their deaths
 durbhaagya se aaj bhi modi sarkaar or sushamaa ji raajnneeti kar rahi hai, jo ki nindaneey he

 If you are preparing to buy gold, then wait for the budget
 philhal 31 hajaar ke paar pahunch chukaa sona bajet ke baad sasta ho saktaa he
 It is being said that after the budget, gold prices may come down
 indian bullian jewalers association(ibja) ko ummid he ki vitt mantri arun jetali is bajet main sone par lagane vaale aayaat shulk ko gata sakate hai
 If this happens, it can reduce the prices of gold by 600 to 1200 rupees
 ghatega aayaat shulkessociation ke upaadhyakshasorabh gadgilane ummid jataai he ki vitt mantri jetali sone ke aayaat shulk main 2 se 4 fisadi kii katautee kar sakate hai
 He says that the reduction in import duty will put a break on the continued rise in gold prices
 iske saath hi sona khareednaa bhi sasta hoga
 You will get such benefit: More than 95 percent of the gold consumption in India is imported
 maujuuda samay main 10 gram ke liye 31000 rupee chukaane pad rahe hai
 If the import duty is also cut by one per cent, then the cost of importing per 10 grams will be reduced by more than Rs 300
 aise main bajet main vitt mantri arun jetali agar 2 se 4 fisadi kii katautee karte hai, to sone ke daam 600 se 1200 rupee tak prati 10 gram neeche aa sakate hai
 This step is being decided by Finance Minister Jaitley
 bullian industry kaa kahana he ki aayaat shulk kii vajah se desh main sone kii taskari ko badhaava mila he
 Currently, the import of gold in the country attracts a 10 percent import duty
 industrica maananaa he ki agar sarkaar aayaat shulk main katautee karti he, to isse na sirf aam aadmi ko phayda milegaa, balki sone kii taskari par bhi roak lagane main bhi madad mil sakati he

 At the same time, several important instructions were also issued, such as prohibiting the dumping of garbage in a radius of 500 meters from the river bank

 The result is that no reduction in pollution of the Ganges has been seen so far

 ) sunanda pushkar maamle main congress netaa shashi tharur kaa poligraph test ho saktaa he
 Delhi Police can call him for this test
 kuch dinon pehle shashi tharur ke naukar or staff kaa bheepoligraph testakaraayaa gaya tha
 Delhi Police Commissioner Bhimsen Bassi confirmed that the investigation team will take all necessary steps to get to the bottom of the case
 tharur kii sahmati ke baad hi hoga test!sutron se mili khabar ke mutabik is maamle main court se ijaajat ke baad police agali karrwai karegi
 Sources say that the police will have to get permission from the court for the polygraph test and this can only happen when Shashi Tharoor himself is ready for this
 gauratlab he ki shashi tharur pehle hi kah chuke hai ki vah jaanch main puri tarah se sahyog karne ko taiyaar hai
 At present, no application for polygraph test has been made by Delhi Police
 gauratlab he ki dilli policetharur kii patni sunanda pushkaraki maut ke maamle main pehle hi 6 gavaahon kaa poligraph test karvaa chuki he
 Let us tell you that Sunanda Pushkar (51) was found dead in her room at Delhi's Leela Hotel in January 2014
 is saal janvari main dilli police ne daawa kiya tha ki sunanda kii maut jehar kii vajah se hui thi or uske baad hatya kaa maamla darj kiya gaya tha
 You may have seen or heard of many unknown ways to hide enemies, but this way of killing someone is shocking
 chitthiyon main aksar pyaar yaa takaraar basataa he
 But there is also a letter which divides death
 letters bam yaa phir parcel bam kaa yah maamla bihar ke gaya kaa he, jahaan ek netaa ke ghar khubasurat gift pack main lipta ek parcel pahunchataa he
 The name and address of the sender is also written on the packet, but as soon as the parcel opens, death strikes with a bang
 gaya shahar kii is ghatana ne sabko chaunkaa diya he
 While a person lost his life in this strange bomb blast, it also started a new debate in the political circles of Bihar
 kyonki bam kahin or nahin balki gaya main sattadhari party ke kaddavar netaa or mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke kareebi maane janevaale jediu jila adhyaksh abhaya kumaar kushvaha ke ghar fata tha
 Tuesday, May 26, 2015 It was a common morning in Kujapi locality
 jediu netaa abhaya kushvaha ke gharavaalon ne dekha ki koi unke daravaaje par ek parcel rakh kar chalaa gaya he
 This was slightly different from a parcel that came in any home, because usually the person who delivered it during delivery of any such packet or gift arriving by courier or post, would take it from the householders for its recovery
 parcel ke upar computericed tareeke se tip kar baqayada abhaya kumaar kushvaha kaa naam or unka puraa pataa likhaa hua tha
 Among those who sent it was the name of an Inayat Khan from Patna
 haalanki is dabbe par patna kaa puraa pataa nahin likhaa tha, lekin tab kushvaha parivaar ko iske peeche kisisajeesh kaa koi shakanhin hua
 The parcel wrapped in a beautiful wrapper seemed like a great gift at first sight
 tab abhaya kushvaha apane ghar main nahin the
 So, the family members took the packet and kept it inside
 kareeb ek ghante baad kushvaha kii patni anjali kii nigaah ghar main rakhe packet par padi
 She tries to go ahead and unpack the packet, but the wrapper had just removed that she sees a bunch of red-yellow wires inside
 taron kaa guchha or shaq kii shuruyatpacket main taar kaa guchha dekh anjali ko kuch samaj nahin aayaa
 He told this to his guest Santosh
 santosh ne ghar main hi so rahe anjali ke bhai or kushvaha ke saale jaihind ko khabar di
 Both of them saw the gifts at their respective levels
 unhen shaq ho gaya ki gift ke is parcel main koi bam bhi ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the two immediately moved the parcel out of the house
 kushvaha ke ghar main kaam karne vaale santosh ne parcel ko dobaaraa jaanchane kii koshish kii
 But then the parcel burst with a loud bang
 is dhamaake ke saath hi kuch der ke liye to sabhi kii ankhon ke saamne dhuaan or andhera chaa gaya
 But when the smoke blew, both Santosh and Jaihind were bled on the spot
 yah manjar dekhte hi puure mohalle menchikh-pukaraka machana ab saamaanya baat thi
 Read further, what does the police say, the police, the hospital and Santosh's death: The two injured are rushed to the hospital immediately after the explosion with the help of nearby people, but the doctor, who is badly injured in the blast, tells the dead as soon as they reach the hospital
 
 police bhi mauka-e-vaardaat par pahunchati he
 Being one of the Naxalite affected districts of Bihar, Gaya had witnessed numerous incidents of blasts around it
 lekin ye pehla mauka tha jab dhamaakaa parcel bam kii surat main hua tha
 Despite several days of passing, the police could not find any specific clues of the attackers in this case
 lekin jis tarah se ye parcel bam ek netaa ke ghar main bhijavaya gaya, use dekh kar itnaa to saaf he ki bam bhejne vaale abhaya kumaar kushvaha ke bare main badi baarik jaankariyaan ikattha kii thim
 Actually, Kushwala is educated and he is very fond of online shopping
 yahi vajah he ki unke ghar main aise packets or parcel kaa pahunchnaa nai baat nahin he
 The process of giving them gifts also continues
 kya kahati he puliceek parcel kii surat main jediu netaa abhaya kumaar kushvaha ke ghar pahanchi is maut kaa rahasy itnaa gaharaa he ki kai din guzarane ke baavjood gaya police iskaa ore-chor pataa nahin laga saki he
 Actually, according to the police, packing a bomb in a parcel
 us par khubasurat gift raper lagaana or phir use chupake se netaa ke daravaaje par deliver karnaa, is baat kii ore ishaara karata he ki iske peeche kisi nausikhie badmaash kaa haath nahin balki kisi shaatir dimag kii sajeesh he
 Sources say that Kushwaha may have an enemy behind the attack, who is suffering from his progress
 kyonki haal ke dinon kushvaha kaa kad naa sirf party main badha tha, balki unhen chunaav main tikat milane kii bhi ummid ho chali he
 The history of parcel bombs may have shocked everyone in the case of a death caused by a parcel bomb in Gaia, but the date witnesses that the parcel bomb is not new in the world
 yah 18veen shatabdi se hi chalaa aa rahaa he
 The first parcel bomb came into existence in Europe, when it was first used in Denmark
 iske baad 19veen sadi main duniya main kai jagah parcel bam kaa istemaal hua
 America's enemies tried to target the then Vice President Thomas Marshall with a letter bomb in 1915
 1947 main bhi ek baar america raashtrapati harry traroman ko parcel bam bheja gaya, lekin tab white house kii suraksha agenciyon ne ise bekaar kar diya
 Later, Israeli intelligence agency Mossad fiercely used the parcel bomb

 Though keeping in view the dignity of the show, Karan did not say anything at that time, but in London, he has given an open answer
 maine sabhi ko chance diya habaatcheet main karan johar ne kaha he - kangana mere sho par ek mehmaan thim
 She has every right to give her opinion but when she gave her opinion on the subject of nepotism in Bollywood, all i can say is that she may not have fully understood the case

 Tarun Mansukhani, Shakun Batra, Shashank Khaitan or Puneet Malhotra - they do not belong to the film background
 unke bare main koi baat kyon nahin karata
 In his biography, Karan Johar revealed about his sexuality, as far as the matter is related to the actors, Karan has said that he gave a chance to Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt from the film background
 lekin isi ke saath siddharth malhotra ko bhi industry main introdeus kiya, wo bhi utane hi damdaar role ke saath
 In such a situation, Karan has raised the question of Kangana itself
 adhyayan suman ne lee kangana par chutki, kaha- titannic ko doobane se bachaa lenyaha koun he movie mafiakaran ne kangana ranot ke movie mafia coment par bhi joardaar jawaab diya he
 Karan asked the opposite question - what does the movie mafia mean according to Kangana
 unhen kya lagata he ham kya kar rahe hai? agar ham unako filmein nahin de rahe hai to ham movie mafia ban gaye!karan ne kaha ki agar unako kangana ke saath kaam karne main dilchaspee nahin he to is vajah se vah movie mafia nahin ban jate
 However, Karan expressed happiness that Kangana Ranaut has her own point of view on every subject and everyone appreciated her for coming on the show

 But Karan says his silence on the show was the dignity of a host

 agar aap 1970 or 1980 ke dashak kii kuch behad kaamyaab golden jubilee filmon ko len or rupye ke aaj ke mulya par unki kamai anken, to sari 100 karod ru
 200 crores and some Rs
 200 crores
 ko paar kar jaaengi
 Sholay and Jai Santoshi Maa were released in the same week
 jai santoshi maa kam bajet film thi
 Despite being sold for a tenth of what Sholay sold, she did an equal amount of business in the opening performance
 ham sab jaanate hai ki sholay blockbster kaa pratik ban chuki he or uske barakes duusari film kaa koi zikr tak nahin karata (haalanki maine kar hi diya)
 We need a word to measure success, so tomorrow's 'golden Jubilee' today '' 100 crores
 ’’ kii kamai main tabdeel ho gai he
 All filmmakers are worried about box office earnings and want them to succeed
 mujhe isamen koi shaq nahin ki aane vaale dinon main film produsar kisi star ko is aadhaar par chunenge ki kya vah 100 karod ru
 May or may not be guaranteed to be taken to a club
 ab filmon ke 25-50 hafte tak chalane vaala daur chalaa gaya he isliye kamyaabi ko aaj paison se taula jaataa he
 100 crore in this sense
 paryaapt rakam he, lekin kamai, kharch or bikri kaa ganit jatil hota he
 50 crore in making a film considered
 lage, to uske pramotion par 15-20 karod ru
 It will also cost, besides add interest
 isse laagat 70 karod ru
 It reaches
 munafa kamaane ke liye jaruri he ki film apni production laagat kaa doguna kaarobaar kare
 Hence the film cost 140 crores
 kii kamai kerani hi hogi
 Now it will be interesting to see how many films finally reach this figure
 iske ulat kuch duusari filmein hai jo 12-15 karod ru
 Rs
 60-70 crores
 tak kii kamai kar leti hai
 This is four times the cost
 100 karod ru
 Compared to Vali, this low budget film looks better
 mujhe ummid he ki aaj ke filmkaar 100 karod ru
 Will not be under pressure to make a film that touches the fork
 creativity ko agar ek nishchit rakam ke saamne ghutane techne par majaboor kiya gaya to yah bhadda majaak hoga
 In a film, the selection of the story, the script and all the elements that are put into its making, they all have the same objective to make the film "entertaining" so that more and more people see it
 ise kamai or munaafe main kaise tabdeel kiya jaae yah jatil masalaa he
 It is just like picking out which news can go to the front page when taking out a newspaper or magazine, and while doing this it is kept in mind that more and more people read things on weekends
 aaj ke filmi kaarobaar main pehle weekend ko lekar jo soch hoti he, vah bhi kuch aisi hi hoti he
 This has also become the standard measure of film success and status
 jahaan tak ‘reating’ kii baat he, yah shabd hi mere liye asangat he
 After all, how are five or seven stars the scale of a film being good? Instead it can be 20 or 30 or even 10 stars? The scales indicate, although they have their own logic behind
 ye is baat se bhi tay hote hai ki bazaar kisi pratikriya detaa he
 Multiplexes dominated and ticket prices rose
 yah badhotaree teji se badhate madhyavarg kii jeb kaa khyaal rakhkar kii gai he
 Due to all this, earnings have increased and now the cost recovery is very fast
 teen din ke bheetar laagat kaa bada hissaa vasuul ho jane se film khud apane saare kharch nikaalane main sakasham he
 This collected money also earns the broadcasting rights associated with the instant release on TV
 film kii vishwasaneeyata kaa akalan aajkal teji se hone laga he kyonki aaj tej sanchaar madhyamon ke chalate yah pal bhar main duniya tak pahunch jaati he
 Piracy is also an issue
 theatron main teen hafte beete nahin ki tivi par aap ise bina paise kharch kiye dekh sakate hai
 Now imagine how the rating of that film will be when the distribution rights of a film have been given to a distributor for a period of seven to ten years
 india today patrika ko isi vichaar kii vajah se pakshik se saptahik kar diya gaya kyonki sabhi ke paas teevr sanchaar madhyam uplabdh ho jane ke baad maheene ke ant tak to koi bhi khabar basi ho jaaegi
 i do not think the audience gets 100 crores
 ke aankade se koi sarokaar hota hoga
 The audience likes you for your acting in the film, not for earning
 zyada samajhadaar darshak to unheen filmon ko dekhte hai jinaki ‘‘acchhee kahani’’ hoti he
 However, it makes no sense to make fun of the content of Khanty Commercial Film
 yah jaruri he ki donon kism ke cinema astitv main rahen
 Both have relevance in our society or any society
 aakhirkaar ek hi bazaar main plaboy or time donon ne hi apni-apni chhavi banaai
 It would be bad for me to think that i should spend my (limited) creativity in the pursuit of reaching a financial goal
 agar ham sirf vittiya kamyaabi ke paimaane par taul kar filmein banane lage, to yah bahut bura hoga
 Amitabh Bachchan has 58,44,037 followers on Twitter
 agar aap 1970 or 1980 ke dashak kii kuch behad kaamyaab golden jubilee filmon ko len or rupye ke aaj ke mulya par unki kamai anken, to sari 100 karod ru
 200 crores and some Rs
 200 crores
 ko paar kar jaaengi
 i expect today's filmmakers to make 100 crores
 kaa kanta chune vaali film ko banane ke dabaav main nahin aaenge
 If creativity was forced to kneel in front of a certain amount, it would be a ridiculous joke

 Leander Paes, who played a key role in making Indian tennis a newcomer, made it clear that he never declined to play in the Davis Cup World Group playoffs against Serbia and is ready to play for the country all the time
 itnaa hi nahin unhone kaha ki mahesh bhupati kii vajah se unke liye landan olympic bura rahaa tha
 When asked about teaming up with the medalist at the London Olympics, who did not win because of Mahesh, Paes said, "no, it will never happen
" vyaktigat rup se meraa dhyaan grandslam or olympic par he
 i do not know how long Mahesh will be on the court
 usne khelnaa kam kar diya he kyonki philhal vah keval do toornament main khelaa he
 He said, 'but it is important for me to reach my goal
 yahaan tak ki meraa puraa ekal kariyar mahesh ke aane se pehle tak chalaa jisamen mujhe safalataa mili or maine olympic padak jeeta
 Paes said, "even after he retires, my goal is to make it to the Rio Olympics and win a medal

 After this, i was asked what role i would like to play in the player, captain and such, for this question also my answer was same as before
 ise galat tareeke se liya gaya
 As far as i am concerned, i am ready to play for the country
 agar srbija ke khilaaf hone vaale mukaable ke liye meri jarurat padati he or agar mujhe khilaadi yaa captain kisi bhi bhoomika main utaara jaataa he, to main apana sarvshereshth dene kii koshish karuunga
 Paes said, "I should get a call from AITA
 i will give my best for India
" bharat main eitie tennis chalaata he or agar unhen lagata he ki meri upasthiti se badlaav ho saktaa he to phir srbija ke khilaaf mukaable ke liye team ke saath rahoonga
 Earlier reports had said that Paes would not be available for the match in September but the veteran said his statement was misrepresented

 ' Indian team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has been sweating to win against two weaker teams in the World Cup, said on Friday that there is no lack of enthusiasm among his players but having enthusiasm does not mean confronting the opposition batsmen
 tej gendbaaj es srisanth kaa naam liye bagaiyr dhoni ne is baat par asahmati jataai ki koi gendbaaj vipakshi ballebaajon se bhidane kaa prayaas kare
 Dhoni was asked how his team can continue to keep Josh from reaching his best form
 captain dhoni ne kaha, josh barkaraar rakhane kaa mul mantra yah he ki aap behatar tiimon ke khilaaf khelte samay aap dabaav main kaise dhalate hai
 Josh is often mistakenly judged by body language
 unhone kaha, ballebaaj kii ore janaa or kuch kahana josh nahin he
 Rather, i believe that no batsman listens to what you are doing because 50,000 people are present in the stadium

 This time all eyes will be on Bhopal Lok Sabha seat of Madhya Pradesh
 kyonki yahaan muqabla hone ja rahaa he congress ke varisht netaa or 10 saal tak madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri rahe digvijay singh or maalegaanv dhamaake kii aaropee or bijepi pratyaashee sadhvi pragna ke bich
 This contest is also considered interesting because after 16 years, Digvijay is in the center of the politics of Madhya Pradesh and he is going to be confronted by his fierce opponent Sadhvi Pragya
 is mukaable ko 72 kii umr ke digvijay ke liye aar-paar kii ladaai mana ja rahaa he to vahiin sadhvi pragna ke liye yah ek tarah se siyasat kii shuruyaat he
 But political pundits say that for Digvijay, this contest should not be overwhelming
 kyonki bhopal loksabhaa seat bijepi kaa garh he or congress 1984 ke baad yahaan se jeet darj nahin kar pai he
 If we look at the figures, the last time the Congress won in 1984 was in Bhopal
 iske baad yahaan 35 saal se loksabhaa chunaav main lagaataar bijepi jitati aa rahi he
 In 1989, Sushil Chandra Sharma opened a BJP account here, after which he won continuously in 1991, 1996 and 1998
 iske baad 1999 main yahaan se uma bharti, 2004 or 2009 main kailash joshi or 2014 main alok sanger chunaav jite the
 Shivraj's entry will spoil Digvijay's work
 
 
 digvijay singh kii bhopal loksabhaa seat par jeet isliye bhi mushkil ho sakati he kyonki bijepi ne madhya pradesh main kisi bahari netaa ko loksabhaa chunaav kaa prabharee banane ke bajaay purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko kaman di he
 After the name of Sadhvi Pragya was announced, Shivraj and Sangh became active and also called an urgent meeting in Bhopal and started uniting BJP leaders
 dekha jaae to sadhvi pragna ko shivaraj kaa saath milane ke baad digvijay ke liye ladaai or mushkil ho gai he
 Because in Bhopal, Shivraj has a good hold and even in rural areas he has a penetration
 aise main shivaraj kii chhavi kaa phayda sadhvi pragna ko mil saktaa he
 What the caste equations and the mathematics of assembly say
 
 
 bhopal loksabhaa seat ke jaateey sameekaran ko dekha jaae to yahaan sabase zyada 75 se 80 pratishat hindu voter hai
 While 20 to 25 percent of the Muslims are voters
 vahiin, anusuchit jati ke voters yahaan 14

 56 pratishat he
 Apart from this, 21 percent of the voters live in rural areas and the rest in urban areas

 The girl is named Nisha Kaur Weber by Sunny
 ab nisha ke bare main ek khabar yah saamne aa rahi he ki nisha ko sani se pehle 11 jodon ne god lene se manaa kar diya tha

 is saal 21 june ko nisha ko sani ko refer kiya gaya tha

 sani ne duusare hi din nisha ke liye haa kah diya tha
 After completing the necessary actions, Sunny was allowed to take the child to pre-adoption Foster Care from Latur, Maharashtra
 ab sani court ke order kaa intjaar kar rahi hai, jahaan unhen or unke pati danniel vibar ko nisha ke legal parents kaa darja de diya jayega
 Sunny Leone is going to do this for the first time, said - There is a lot of excited Hansi Overseas Citizen of India (OCI)
 aise nagarikon ke liye bharat main baccha god lenaa thodaa mushkil hota he
 Because there is an effort to give children to Indian citizens first
 jab bacchon ko do maheene tak god nahin liya jaataa, tab hi unhen videshi kaplus ko refer kiya jaataa he
 Of the children referred to foreign residents, 60% are children with special needs and 90% are older than two years
 kyonki do saal se bade bacchon kii demand bhartiya jodon main kam hoti he

 In the chest of these inaccessible and beautiful hills of Uttarakhand, many mythological tales, including Sanjivani, are buried
 pehali baar uttarakhand sarkaar ne dronagiri ilaake main paryaton ko badhaava dene ke liye dronagiri trek kaa aayojan kiya
 Aaj Tak correspondent Manjit Singh Negi started his journey from Joshimath with a team to reach Sanjeevani Booti during the Dronagiri track
 is anuthi yatra kaa haal unheen kii jubaani suniye
 
 
 The distance from Joshimath to Dronagiri is about 55 kilometers, of which 13 kilometers have to be traveled
 yahi rasta china kii seemaa par based niti gaanv ko bhi jaataa he
 The journey goes ahead Tapovan village of mythological importance comes on the way
 manyata he ki isi gaanv main devi sati ne hajaaron saal tak shiv kii aradhana kii thi
 We tried to learn about Sanjeevani from the priests present here
 tapovana se aage badhate hi dronagiri parvat kii jhalak milani shuru ho jaati he
 People from all over the country participated in the Dronagiri track
 parmparik lokanrity se kaarykram kii shuruyaat hui
 The thing about religion, culture, mystery, adventure and trekking is very unique in this Devbhoomi of Uttarakhand
 aaj ham vahaan ja rahe hai jahaan treta main bhagwaan ram ke doot hanuman ke kadam pade the or vah us amuly vastu ko uthaakar uttarakhand se srilanka le gaye, jise sanjivani kehete hai
 a large number of locals and people from all over the country were present on this occasion
 sthaneey vidhayak ne dronagiri trek koi hari jhandi dikhaai
 The trek starts from Juma
 After proceeding from Joshimath, hot water sources are found in many places along the way, which are believed to have originated from the drops of water from the hair of Goddess Parvati
 aage raste main hamaari mulaakaat bhotiya janajati ke logon se hoti he
 The special thing is that for six months these people live on the mountains of Badrinath with their flocks and six months in the plains
 thodaa aage jane par juma gaanv aata he, jahaan se dronagiri kii paidal yatra shuru hoti he
 After crossing Dhauliganga, the path starts on foot
 is safar main bachche, buudhe jawan or mahilayen sabhi shaamil thim
 Everyone was thrilled about this amazing journey
 rasta sidhi chadhaai or baarik pagadendi se hokar jaataa he
 Our breath was blooming empty-handed, while people going to Dronagiri were carrying a heavy burden on their shoulders

 After traveling about three kilometers, our first destination i
e
 Ruing village arrived
 ruing gaanv pahunchane par gaanv kii mahilaon ne parmparik taur-tareekon se logon kaa swaagat kiya
 We were welcomed with a bhojpatra and a garland made from local herbs
 iske saath hi sthaneey nrity or gayan ne sabakaa man moh liya
 The last village of India is Tibet on the other side of Mount Dronagiri, so this village is also called the last village of India from this end
 ruing gaanv main pehali raat hamanen tent main guzari
 The night temperature falls here considerably
 sone ke liye sleeping bag kii jarurat padati he
 The next day at 6 am we started our journey to Dronagiri

 Many mysteries and adventures in the Dronagiri valley are still seen tweeting in the lap of nature

 Another interesting thing is seen here
 yahaan parvat devtaa kii puja ke liye koi mandir nahin he balki dronagiri parvat ko hi devtaa mana jaataa he
 First of all, Dronagiri mountain is worshiped by traditional rituals
 unhen khaas prasad or madiraa kaa bhoga lagaaya gaya
 That is why mountaineering on Dronagiri is prohibited
 lokmanyata he ki jo log isaki koshish karte hai wo maut ke munh main samaa jate hai
 Not only this, in the death of someone in the village, he is buried instead of burning, for fear that the smoke that will rise from the burn may destroy the Sanjeevani boot
 dronagiri gaanv pahunchakar hamane dekha ki yahaan na to koi jawan ladkaa dikhaa, na ladki yaa koi baccha
 The women did definitely see one or two who came here in search of herbs
 asal main baaki log gaanv chhodkar nichle sthalon ke gaanv main ja based hai taaki shiksha le saken or vakt ke saath kadamtal bhi kar sake
 The villagers of the one crore rupees kilogram seek here only wait for the snow to melt so that they can see the divine medicines that are shining at night in the valley

 Let's cover the area spread over a radius of 5 km so that the worm can mainly find the herbs
 keedaa jadi kii antarrashtriya bazaar main prati kilo thok keemat 1 karod he jise kharidne log dronagiri jaise gaanv tak pahunch jate hai
 Dhauli is the origin of the Ganges from these glaciers
 yaheen baagini glacier, girthi glacier, changbang glacier, niti glacier nikalate hai
 The special thing is that girls or women do not participate in the puja, because it is believed that the devotee Hanuman was told by an old woman the address of Sanjeevani
 sadiyon saalon baad bhi dronagiri ke logon kaa atoot vishwaas he ki yahaan pahaado par sanjivani booti maujuud he
 a wide variety of herbs exist on the mountains of Dronagiri
 kai jadi-bootiyon ko yahaan ke log sanjivani kaa pratik maanakar apane ghar kii choukhaton par lagaate hai
 Sanjeevani is present on Dronagiri
 jo barf padane par suukh jaati he, lekin pahaad par chipki hui haalat main rahati he
 This can be seen when the ice melts
 inamen jadi-bootiyaan main hi sanjivani he
 However, it is yet to be identified on scientific basis

 com / nz60z0gcls You remember the cartoon character named Popeye, don't you? Hey, the same Popeye who used to eat spinach before fighting the enemy and his muscles used to get strength as soon as he ate spinach
 khayr, yah to hui cartoon kairactor kii baat
 The person we are talking about here is not a cartoon, but a living person
 ji haa, brazil ke rahane vaale arlindo disuja kii bicepse 29 inch kii he
 In Brazil, the arms of none other than him are so large
 lekin popaye or arlindo main ek bahut bada fark he
 While Popeye used to eat spinach to increase the strength of his biceps, Aralindo injects a cocktail of lethal oils and alcohol into his body to inflame the muscles
 haalanki ve is baat ko sweekaarte hai ki isse unhen khatarnaak infections ho saktaa he
 Let us tell you that in Brazil, bodybuilders are jeopardizing their lives by taking such dangerous injections
 kai logon ke haath tak kaatane pade or kai kii to maut bhi ho gai
 Arlindo says, 'my friend Paulhino died because of this
 usne bhi injection liye the or main bhi letaa hum, lekin usne had kar di thi
 He used to take a lot of injections
 main sabhi ko is tel kaa istemaal na karne kii salaah detaa hum
 i have now stopped taking injections or similar things
 hameshaa ichha hoti he ki phir se shuru kar duun
 But i am learning to control myself '
 shuruyaat main arlindo apni body banane ke liye steroid, hormones or horse vitamin le rahe the
 Then a fellow of Jim introduced him to such oil, by which he could overcome his muscles by enlarging his muscles
 unhone bataaya, 'gym ke us dost ne mujhe tel diya or kaha ki kuch hi dinon main tumhuri body ban jaaegi
 i put oil in the syringe and applied it on my arm
 meri baaju usee vakt phool gai
 i did not feel anything at that time
 halkaa sa chakkar jaisaa aayaa, lekin iske alaava or kuch nahin'
 Arlindo says, 'despite taking oil injections, i kept exercising like before
 zyaadaatar logon ko thik se injection lenaa nahin aata
 Some lose their hands, some have to undergo an operation, some lose their lives'
 is tarah ke injection lene se swasthya buree tarah prabhavit hota he
 Arlindo finds himself worried
 ve doctor ke paas bhi gaye the, lekin aspataal ne oparation karne se manaa kar diya kyonki unhone khud apni aisi haalat kii thi
 They say, 'I can go to the doctor only if i fall ill or my arm is torn'
 arlindo ne do saal pehle injection lenaa shuru kiya tha or tabhi se brazil main wo surkhiyon main hai
 But his family is very concerned about him
 unki bahan kahati hai ki wo bahut achche insaan hai or ab unka ghar bas janaa chahie

 adhyadesh ke jariye jode ja rahe is nae section ke tahat praavdhaan kiya gaya he, jiskaa asar un chand logon, jisamen vilphul difolter (swechha se diwalia hue) bhi shaamil hai, or jinke acount ko ek saal yaa adhik samay ke liye non parforming asset ghoshit kiya gaya he
 Such people can no longer be involved in the process of any kind of solution
 adhyadesh ke jariye yah badlaav bankerpsi code ke section 2, 5, 25, 30, 35 or 240 main section 29A or 235A
 After the approval of the ordinance from the President, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley tweeted this information
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle bijness today ne apni report main kaha tha ki is adhyadesh se vilphul difolter or jinka acount rigerv bank se enpie ghoshit hua he yaa phir company act ke tahat pratibandhit hue company ke diarector us company kii nilaamee prakriya main shaamil nahin ho sakate
 However, this law does not make much sense in the current situation as no promoter has been declared a defaulter in the 12 major bankruptcy cases in the country
 ise bhi padhein: 15wein vitt ayog ko manjuuri, GST ke baad kendra-rajya ke bich rajasav bantwaare kaa banegaa nayaa formulagauratlab he ki kendra sarkaar dwaara adhyadesh ko manjuuri die jane ke baad jindal samooh ke chairman or emdi sajjan jindal ne kaha ki aise praavdhaan se vishwasaneey samaadhaan kii koshish ko jhatka lagegaa
 The central government implemented the bankrupt code from December 2016
 is code kii madad se kendra sarkaar desh main 147 billian dollar ke gande karj kii samasya se nipatane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Due to this, the central government had asked all banking institutions not to give the fraud fraudsters a chance to buy their dirty property again
 lihaaja, adhyadesh se sa praavdhaan ko karne ke baad ab kendra sarkaar aagaamee sheetakaaleen satr main vidheyak ke jariye kanoon main badlaav karne kii pahal karegi
 The move has been taken by the central government following some reports where it was claimed that the directors and promoters of some companies undergoing insolvency process are preparing to buy their assets once again
 aisi companiyon ko bainkon dwaara jald nilaamee ke liye laayaa janaa he or maujuuda kanoon unhen dubaara sampatti kharidne se nahin roak rahi thi
 Significantly, there are 300 cases pending before the National Tribunal Law Tribunal (NCLT), set up to deal with dirty debts in the country, where the process of auctioning the property to recover the submerged debt is to be done

 Film Review: Tamanchactor: Richa Chadha, Nikhil Dwivedi, Damandeep singhdirector: Navneet Bahlrating: 1 Starraja Mishra
 clem of fame- do karod kii phiroti vaala apharan
 Gundi named Babu
 jo gundai nahin karti
 The intoxicating goods of lakhs fly from here to there
 donon police ke hathe chadhate hai
 Sitting in a van and going to jail
 vine palat jaati he
 Falls into the abyss
 sab mar jate hai
 Raja and Babu survive
 raja babu bhaagate hai
 Let's fight
 police se bachate hai
 And among them, the king falls in love with Babu
 tamaacha, rulaai or kuch gaanon ke baad babu raja ko pyaar detii he
 And then it fades
 raja apni rani kii khoj main nikalataa he or rana se takaraata he
 Rana was a wrestler, he had great respect
 ab badmaash he or use aas he ki vah maadak padaarthon ke karodon ke kaarobaar kaa karamaati khilaadi ban saktaa he
 And yes, Babu is Rana's girlfriend
 half nahin, phul
 For two years
 lekin raja ke rana ke gang main shaamil hone ke baad babu kaa dil bubbly badmaash ban jaataa he
 Rana seems to have been forcibly exploiting him till now and the king has come to save him
 aakhir main har mahaan hindi film kii tarah hogi pyaar kii jeet yaa phir haar
 
 
 Director Navneet Rana has cooked it on the heat wrapped in all spices
 film tamanchey bahut hi ghasitamar dhang se banaai gai he
 The emphasis of the director and writer has been to present the Hindi strip jumal in the form of dialogue
 masalan, dhaniya bo denge, diwaar khod denge or likh denge kranti
 But both the payment and the timing of the dialog is not a bulwark
 kahani kachi he or screenple main kasaavat kii kami he
 The film rests on Babu i
e
 Richa's shoulders
 magar unka kirdaar teen chizon main magan rahata he
 Profanity, being intoxicated and proving yourself to be 21 in the business of men
 or ye teenon hi kaam bahut foohad shakal main saamne aate hai
 Richa is doing all this under pressure to become a main stream actress
 dekhie kahaan le jaataa he ye unako
 Nikhil Dwivedi is also depressed in the role of Raja
 raja ke role main unki jabaan ulajhaau he or vah kahin se bhi maati kaa geelaapan gale main nahin laa pate
 Rana is played by Damandeep
 vah anthe hue rahete hai or gabaru or thasapane se bharpoor dikhte hai is role main
 But they do not leave any special effect
 film retro rangath apnaane kii koshish karti he
 But these films have done many films and much better
 first half main romens kii khatir har paanch minute main gaanon kaa camershal brake aata he
 The film becomes more uneasy in its affair
 tamanchey ek acchhee desi romantic thriller ho sakati thi
 But it shot not at heart with love, but at the story and the screenplay
 natijatan, manoranjan ghayal ho gaya or hamaare paison kii jaan chali gai
 Oum peace
 Film Review: har haal main dekhen 'haidar'film Review: baing baing
 Oops, it became a bad story and a weak acting: Soha Ali Khan's charmer kendriya rigerv bank kii dwimasik maudrik samiksha baithak kaa aaj teesraa or aakhri din he
 In this meeting later in the afternoon, the Reserve Bank is expected to take an important decision on interest rates in the country
 haalanki is baithak main kendra sarkaar samet bazaar kii najar rigerv bank gallernor urjit patel par lagi he
 Will Urjit Patel once again launch a new tussle between the central government and the Reserve Bank, insisting on rbi's demand for autonomy after a three-day meeting for monetary review
 kendriya rigerv bank kii dwimasik maudrik samiksha teen kaarnon se kaarobaari jagat main charchaa kaa vishay banati he
 First, how is the central bank assessing the risk of inflation in the country and second, whether the central bank has changed the repo rate (RR) and cash reserve ratio (CRR)
 is maudrik samiksha main bhi kendriya bank inhen muddon par manthan kar rahaa he lekin is baar ke nateezon main rigerv bank or kendra sarkaar ke maujuuda rishte kaa sanket bhi milegaa
 Repo rate is the rate at which a bank takes a loan from the central bank for a short period
 iske alaava is dar se desh main byaaj daren nirdhaarit hoti hai jisapar kisi kaarobaari athwa aam upabhokta ko bank se karj or nivesh par byaaj miltaa he
 The cash reserve ratio is the portion of the bank's total money that it holds with the central bank
 is dar ko nirdhaarit kar rigerv bank bazaar main taralata tay karata he yani isse bank ke paas karj dene kii kshamta main badlaav hota he
 To save SBI money, power will be expensive in 5 states including Gujarat, Rajasthan, result of RBI bi-monthly monetary review will come on December 5
 is baar kaarobaari jagat ke saath aam aadmi kii najar bhi rigerv bank ke faisle par tiki he
 These results will clarify whether the relationship between the Reserve Bank and the Central Government has decreased after three days of exercise or whether these results will form the basis of a new tussle between the two
 arabiai kii dwimasik maudrik samiksha main kul 6 sadsy baithte hai
 Three of these members are RBI officials including the Reserve Bank Governor
 vahiin anya teen sadsy arthshaastri hone ke saath-saath kendra sarkaar dwaara manonith hote hai
 The RBI governor is the main character in this review meeting and after three days of discussion, the decision on repo rate is done on the basis of number force
 nehru indira rahe naakaam, kya PM Modi banaaenge bharat ko P-6?samiksha baithak main repo rate par faisla barabari par rahane kii sthiti main rigerv bank governor antim faisla lene main ahm bhoomika adaa karte hai
 Also, in order to maintain the confidentiality of the entire matter, the vote of the members is not shared during the review meeting 7 days before and 7 days after the meeting
 haalanki sabhi sadsy, desh kii aarthik sthiti samet vaishvik sthiti or repo rate nirdhaarit karne ke liye ahm mahangaai kaa akalan karne ke liye swatantra rahata he or baithak kii 7 din baad sadasyon kaa akalan jari kiya jaataa he
 What will be the reduction or reduction in interest rates? On the basis of CRR economic data, one thing is clear that this monetary review meeting has all the grounds for not cutting the interest rate which were in front of the last monetary review meeting
 oktober main khudara mahangaai dar main khaadya utpaadon kii mahangaai arabiai ke target ke behad neeche thi
 During the second quarter, the economic growth rate was less than expected and even consumption figures appeared to be weak
 pichhali baithak ke samay jahaan vaishvik str par badhati kachche tel kii keemten mahangaai kaa bada khatra pesh kar rahi thim, oktober-november ke dauraan yah khatra kuch had tak talataa dikhaai diya
 Petrol-diesel prices have been reduced by 25 to 30 percent since the last meeting
 iske alaava dollar ke mukaable rupee main bhi sudhaar se arthvyavastha main dabaav beete do maheene ke dauraan kam hua he
 Despite this relief, the challenge regarding crude oil has not yet stopped permanently
 rigerv bank ke saamne maudrik samiksha ke dauraan siaraar ek pechida vishay he
 It is from this that the central bank has not made any change in the CRR since 2013
 beete kuch maheenon ke dauraan jis tarah kendra sarkaar ne bazaar main taralata badhaane kii maang rakhi he or isko lekar rigerv bank or kendra sarkaar ne khinchataan bhi dekhne ko mili he, aise main taralata ko lekar kendriya bank se ahm faisle kaa ummid kii ja sakati he
 However, the Reserve Bank has been continuously increasing the level of liquidity in the market through the Open Market Operation (OMO) for some time
 rigerv bank november or disambar ke dauraan bhi oemo ke jariye taralata badhaane kii kavayad karegi
 Given this fact, the probability of CRR reduction in the monetary review is halved
 gauratlab he ki siaraar main 50 basis point kii katautee se bainkon ke paas 65,000 karod rupee kii atirikt taralata hogi

 is maukey par france ke purv rajanyik pascal majurier bhi maujuud the, jin par apni beti ke yon utpeedan kaa aarope laga tha, lekin saal 2017 main adaalat ne unhen bari kar diya tha
 He said that the mentoo campaign is not meant to answer the metoo movement, rather it will solve the problems of men, who do not speak out against the atrocities of women
 pascal ne kaha, ‘purushon ke paas asli dukh he
 
 
 They are also suffering, but they are not coming out openly against women and their misdemeanors

 However, the US decision to impose more US sanctions on Russia and the closure of the Russian Consulate has raised concerns over the distance between the two countries

 pichley hafte subhash ghai ne mumbai main ek party di
 Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, along with her mother-in-law Jaya Bachchan, reached out to participate in it, and the photo was a rage among journalists
 angreji akhbaar 'hindustan times' main chhapi khabar ke mutabik, is dauraan patrakaron ne bachchan parivaar kii bahu ko 'aishwarya' kya kah diya, jaya bhadak gayi
 It is said that at the same time Jaya said, 'is Aishwarya calling Aishwarya, do you study in your class?' The journalists present there were shocked to hear Jaya's answer
 unhen apni galati samaj hi nahin ai, kyonki unhone 'aishwarya' ko 'aishwarya' hi to kaha tha
 Once, during the press conference, when someone asked Aishwarya to 'ash' while asking Abhishek Bachchan, the younger Bachchan was also angry
 unhone kah diya tha ki aish kya hota he, unka naam aishwarya he, aishwarya hi kaha jaae
 There are more such stars now what journalists should do
 aish kahen to pati bura maan jaataa he or aishwarya kahen to saasuu maa
 This problem is also big because the list of such stars is long, who do not like to be called by certain names
 udhaaharan ke liye govinda ko pasand nahin ki koi unhen public place par 'chichi' kahe
 Aamir likes to be called 'mr
 Khan'
 The newspaper learned from some senior photo journalists about which stars like to be called and what not
 shaadi ke baad genelia disuja ko mumbai main akasar 'vahini' (bhabhi kaa marathi shabd) kaha jaataa he or unhen isse koi aapatti nahin he
 Similarly, Aamir Khan likes to be called 'mr
 Khan'
 salmaan ko 'sallu' mat kehnaaek or photographer ne bataaya ki shahrukh khan 'khan sahab' yaa 'king khan' kahlaana pasand karte hai
 Salman Khan is comfortable with his 'bhai' address, but not with 'sallu Bhai'
 koi unhen 'sallu' kahe, yah unhen bilkul pasand nahin
 Another journalist told that Shatrughan Sinha is affectionately called 'shotgun'
 kai baar unka atensio paane ke liye patrkaar 'khamosh' bhi kah dete hai or yah kaam bhi kar jaataa he
 Taking name, respect is important
 Returning to the issue of Aishwarya, many senior journalists believe that the stars also object to how the name is being taken many times
 agar aap sammaan se naam len, to isamen koi dikkat nahin he
 We have been told that he is now being called 'mrs Bachchan' and his family also likes it

 a few days ago, the Prime Minister had also said that prices of essential goods may increase
 ab vitt mantri pranab mukherjee ne bhi maan liya he ki desh kaa ek bada hissaa sookhe kii chapet main aa chukaa he
 According to the Finance Minister, the current situation in the country is very worrying
 is saal 20 fisadi kharif kii buaai kam hui he or 161 jile sukhe kii chapet main he
 That is, there may be a shortage of grains and other food items in the country in the coming days

 lekin jaisi bhi sthiti saamne aegi use hamen sweekaar karnaa hoga
 The impact of the drought has not been fully revealed yet
 The Minister of Finance says that there is no need to panic due to the dryness, and the government has many options to deal with it
 lekin sawaal ye ki sarkaar kii baat kaise maan lee jaae
 Right now the effect of drying has not completely affected the market, so the prices of essential goods are skyrocketing
 jab sookhe kaa asal asar bazaar par padegaa to pataa nahin keemten kahaan jaaengi
 But in the meantime, it is a matter of relief that despite less rains in Punjab and Haryana, sowing has not been affected and this is only because the ground water level in these areas is better than the rest of the states

 The Prime Minister said that the SP and the BSP are no longer in a position to form the government, hence both these political parties want a hung assembly in the state and no political party gets an absolute majority
 unhone kaha ki donon partiyon ke is mansoobey ko dhwast karne ke liye logon ko bhartiya janata party ko vot karke rajya main ek spasht bahumat kii sarkaar banani chahie
 Modi's rally in UP on Monday - Read report here, but speaking on the stage adorned with slogans beyond 300, the Prime Minister may have established that at present the election is not in the hands of any political party
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki agar bhaajapa kii sthiti behatar hoti to pradhanmantri trishanku vidhansabha vaali baat katai na kehete
 Calling for a clear majority government from the platform, the Prime Minister made it clear that the kind of political situation and voting still visible in the state is not leading any party to a clear majority
 or isi ko aadhaar banaate hue pradhanmantri ek bahumat vaali sarkaar kii maang logon se kar rahe the
 In his speech, the Prime Minister explained the one-phase voting and tried to establish how the mandate is not leading both regional parties to absolute majority
 saath hi yah vishwaas jataayaa ki bhaajapa lagaataar badhat bana rahi he or aage ja rahi he
 The Prime Minister also tried to explain to the people why it is important to form an absolute majority government
 unhone kaha ki aaj duniya ke har kone main bharat kii jai-jayakaar ho rahi he or isaki vajah he 30 saal baad centre main purna bahumat kii sarkaar
 If a similar government is formed in the state, then development is bound to happen

 The SDM report in the case of the deaths of 11 people in Burari in Delhi has been revealed
 report ke mutabik mritak parivaar tantra-mantra main shaamil tha or ghor andhvishwaas kaa shikaar tha
 The way the facts related to the death are coming out before that, the picture is becoming clear from the fact that the family had a superstition
 baba kii talash main pulicedrasal is puure maamle main dilli police kii krime branch ab us baba kii talash main juty he
 Who told this family in the way of death for salvation
 kyonki jis halaat main sabhi shav baraamad hue or phir ghar ke mandir se mila register main likhi baaten saamne aa rahi hai
 It seems that someone had been misleading the family for a long time, as the family had been continuously writing notes since 2015 in the recovered register
 police parivaar ke sabhi sadasyon ke kol detail ko khangaal rahi he
 What is shocking in this whole case is that Burari's family chose death in the same manner as was already recorded in the register
 register main likhaa tha ki koun kahaan latakegaa or thik aisa hi kiya bhi gaya
 The police feel that the Bhatia family was being motivated for a long time to attain death
 register ke pannon par maut kaa tarika, maut kaa din or maut kaa vakt saaf saaf likhaa he
 The police police engaged in decoding the register is now engaged in decoding each page of the register and everything written in it
 kai ahm sawaal police kii padtaal ke centre main hai
 Like who wrote what has been written in the register, is it really written the script of the death of the family in the register, is there a mechanism behind this death, and is there any way to confuse the police
 11 pipon main maut kaa rahasy?darasal dilli main 11 maut kaa andhvishwaas conection bhi saamne aa rahaa he, jis ghar main 11 shav mili usee ghar ke peeche nikle 11 pipe har kisi ko hairaan kar rahaa he
 Nobody seems to understand why 11 such pipes have come out
 khabar ke saath lage photo main dekh sakate hai ki kis tarah se ghar ke baahar 11 pipe nikle hue hai
 Out of these 11 pipes, 7 pipes are bent while 4 are straight
 bhaatia parivaar ke ghar main lage is pipe ko maut ke saath jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 Because there are total pipes in the house which are not installed for any use
 pipe ko dekhakar saaf hota he ki parivaar ko andhvishwaas jakadaaa hua tha
 Because the number of deaths in the house is 11 and pipes are also 11
 iske alaava marane waalon main 7 mahilaayein hai or 4 purush
 While 7 of the 11 pipes in the wall of the house are bent and 4 are straight
 apni rashtriya aakankshaayen jaahir karte hue aam aadmi party (aap) ne shanivaar ko elaan kiya ki vah aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon main zyaadaatar rajyon kii 'adhiktam' siton par chunaav ladegi or apane ummidavaaron kii pehali suchi agle 10-15 dinon main jari kar degi
 At the same time, Delhi Chief Minister and party convenor Arvind Kejriwal said that he will not contest the Lok Sabha elections and will only campaign for the party's candidates
 baharhaal, dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke 'aap' ke pradhanmantri ummidavaar hone kii atakalon ke bich party ke varisht netaa prashanth bhushan ne samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main yah saaf kar diya ki loksabhaa chunaavon ke nattejey ke baad hi is babat faisla kiya jayega
 Bhushan made this announcement after a two-day meeting of the National Executive of AAP
 kal sampann hone vaali is baithak main aaj kejariwal or party ke sabhi varisht netaa maujuud the
 Bhushan said, "AAP will contest maximum seats in most states
 ham madhya farvari yaa bahut se bahut agle maheene ke ant tak apane zyaadaatar ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa kar denge
 Asked if Kejriwal will be declared the prime ministerial candidate of AAP, he said that a decision has not been taken in this regard
 bhushan ne kaha, 'arvind kejariwal party ke sabase bade netaa hai par hamane apane pradhanmantri ummidavaar ke naam par faisla nahin kiya he
 It does not matter to us who will be the prime ministerial candidate
 ' Senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh said, 'the first list of party candidates for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections will be released in 10 to 15 days
 dilli vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye ummidavaaron ke chayan main jo prakriya apanaayi gayi thi vahi loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi apanaayi jaaegi
 ' singh ne kaha ki party un rajyon se chunaav ladegi jahaan uski sanrachana acchhee he or jahaan use eemaandaar ummidavaar milenge
 The AAP leader said, 'during the next one month, the party will meet in every state and decide the names of the Lok Sabha candidates
 aapraadhik or bhrashtachar ke aaropon tathaa apane naitik charitra ko lekar sawaalon kaa saamana kar rahe logon ko tikat nahin die jaaenge
 ' sanjay singh ne kaha ki dilli vidhansabha chunaavon kii tarah loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi har sansadeey seat ke liye party kaa alag ghoshnaa-patr hoga
 Asked if AAP will cut the bjp's urban vote and harm Narendra Modi's aspirations for the Prime Minister's post, Singh said that the party has emerged as an alternative to the Congress and the BJP and that it can 'benefit' any party or It is not contesting for 'loss'
 singh ne kaha, 'rahul gandhi or narendra modi hamaare liye chunavi mudde nahin hai
 We have come here to end people's problems
 ' bhushan ne kaha, 'shahari ilaake ke logon kii tarah hi gramin kshetron main bhi log 'aap' ko lekar utsuk hai
 There are many places where the people of the villages are more keen
 ' He said that people now want an alternative to Congress and BJP and 'AAP' is a mass movement, not a political party
 bhushan ne kaha, '' 'aap' kaa maananaa he ki sarkaar janata kii aakankshaon ke mutabik chalani chahie
 Singh, a member of the two-member sub-committee of the party set up for the Lok Sabha elections, said that there is also an eagerness in the states about the future of the party and a large number of people want to join AAP
 party loksabhaa chunaav ladane kii ichha rakhane vaale ummidavaaron se pehle hi aavedan aamantrit kar chuki he
 Apart from Delhi, senior party leaders from Maharashtra, Haryana and Tamil Nadu attended the national executive meeting
 bhartiya janata party ke purv mahasachiv keen govindacharya ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki laal krishna adwani party ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar isliye bane kyonki party main pratibha sampann netaaon kii kami he
 He said that Advani is not a leader of the Hindutva movement, as well as blamed former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for the current economic turmoil
 kisi samay adwani ke chahete rahe govindacharya ne ek saakshaatkaar main kaha ki adwani party ke liye achche hai, lekin jaruri nahin he ki desh ke liye bhi hon
 According to Govindacharya, the BJP will not come to power in the upcoming parliamentary elections
 gyaat ho ki govindacharya ne 2000 main bhaajapa se tyaagptr de diya tha or vah aatmachintan or adhyayan ke liye avkaash par chale gaye the
 Recently, he has re-energized politics as a service of Uma Bharti's party, Bharatiya Jan Shakti
 govindacharya ne kaha ki adwani ek sahi andolan ke galat netaa ban gaye hai
 There is a huge difference between his words and his actions
 pakistan daure ke dauraan mohammad ali jinna par die gaye bayaan par tippanee karte hue govindacharya ne kaha ki yadi unke paas saahas hota to vah party se alag ho jate, or chaahe kuch bhi ho jaataa, apane bayaan par kaayam rahete
 At the time of the Jinnah controversy, i sent a message to him and asked if you had the courage to follow your principles and raise issues of common people
 pakistan par mandaraate khatre ke prati aagaah karte hue purv raashtrapati parvej musharraf ne ravivaar ko kaha ki desh ke netritv ko suraksha sthiti ke bare main vishwa samudaay kii chintaaon par dhyaan dena chahie lekin kisi ko bhi karrwai kii khaas disha ke bare main upadesh nahin dene chahie
 Before leaving for a visit to Saudi Arabia, Musharraf told reporters here that the country is in danger and problems will arise if we remain entangled in minor and old issues
 unhone kaha ki mudda kaaphi gambhir he
 Everyone in the world is taking the issue of Pakistan seriously
 har koi karrwai kii disha tay karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 Musharraf said that Pakistan should decide its course of action so that the country can be overcome with the current problems
 unhone kaha ki hamen is baat par spasht rahanaa chahie ki koi hamen karrwai kii disha ke bare main upadesh na de
 We have to decide our course of action and save the country and move it towards progress

 Criticizing the decision, Stalin demanded the Central Government to immediately cancel the proposed project
 unhone kaha ki desh main jab aachaar samhita lagu he, tab kaise is project ko hari jhandi di gai

 He said, "when the Code of Conduct is in force, allowing the Terms of Reference (tor) is against the election rules
 unhone ediemke se maang kii he ki chunaav ke kaayade-kanoonon ko dekhte hue use sunishchit karnaa chahie ki project shuru na hon
 Ramdas, president of the aiadmk's partner party PMK, criticized the stand of the Center, stating that such projects would not be allowed in the state

 dilli kooch ke bahaane ek swadhin bharat sanghathan ne mathura ke jawahar baag main sirf chand ghante ke liye aisa deraa daalaa ki do saal se bhi zyada biit gaye, lekin deraa nahin hataa
 Jawahar Bagh was captured
 sanghathan saamanantar sarkaar chalaane laga
 Here the rule of the organization was not only that of law
 tabhi to aamane-saamne kii khooni takkar ke baad jab jawahar baag khaali hua, to peeche hathiyaaron kaa itnaa bada jakhira mila ki khud pulisavaalon kii ankhen bhi fatty kii fatty rah gayi
 Many times, when a knife is found, the police arrest and send people to jail under strict sections of the Arms Act, while people of a religious organization in the middle of Mathura, the birthplace of Lord Krishna, have been under the guise of religion
 They kept collecting weapons and knowing everything, the police administration could not stop them
 ise intelligence felyor kaa naam den yaa phir jaanboojh kar sachai se munh pherane kii laaparvaahee
 The rioters continued to gather arms under the banner of Satyagraha
 bharat vidhik vaicharik satyagrahi sanstha kaa kaam gundgardee, avaidh kabja or aasapaas rahane waalon ko sataana he
 The surprising thing is that this institution set up a base in Mathura in the name of picketing in Delhi and remained frozen in Jawaharbagh for two years
 mathura ke in satyagraiyon ne ek din main jo satyanaash kiya wo police ke liye hajam karnaa baari pad rahaa he
 After coping with the loss in the horrific shootout, when the police took possession of the base, a cache of arms was recovered from there

 This is the reason why, even after about 15 hours, the process of meeting the realities has not stopped completely
 itani badi taadaad main asalhon kaa milanaa hi ye sabit karata he ki jawahar baag par kabja jamaaye logon ke dimag main itane dinon se kya chal rahaa tha
 They had become so chaotic to get their demands agreed
 unka sargana kaise ek samanaantar sarkaar chalaa rahaa tha
 The attack on the police may be the reason why the police had reached the threshold of Jawahar Bagh at around 4
30 pm on Thursday evening that the people in the garden attacked the policemen directly
 hamalaa bhi aise-vaise nahin balki goli or bamon se
 The women climbed above the trees with weapons and were constantly firing at the policemen
 jawahar baag par ye kabja march 2014 se shuru hua tha
 The people of this organization started a Satyagraha Yatra for Delhi from Madhya Pradesh
