 gardish ke daur se guzar rahi congress party ne apana 'bhagya' badalane ke liye chunaav ranneetikaar prashanth kishor kii sevaayen lee hai
 Prashant, who was responsible for planning the election strategy of UP and Punjab, knew that his 'real work' would start when the party is at the lower level
 paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ke baad aisa lagata he ki vah samay aa gaya he
 The party being run by 'gandhi' faced embarrassment last week when it suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP in Assam
 kerala, tamilnadu or pashchim bengal main bhi party / iske gathbandhan ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In such a situation, the biggest challenge before Rahul Gandhi, who is considered to be the face of the Congress party among the public (before the 2019 general election), is to show enthusiasm in the workers by performing well in the assembly elections of the country's largest state Uttar Pradesh next year
 Has upi or punjab rajya main varsh 2017 main hone vaale chunaav ek had tak yah nirdhaarit kar sakate hai ki aglaa piem koun banane ja rahaa hai
 In 2014, BJP won 71 out of 80 parliamentary seats in UP
 congress ke liye isaki adhyaksh sonia gandhi or upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi hi apni seat bachaa paane main safal rahe the
 Realizing the importance of UP elections, Rahul Gandhi has decided to enlist the help of Prashant Kishore in formulating the party's strategy
 prashanth kishor vahiin shaks hai jinhone 2014 ke aam chunaav main aadhunik takneekee kaa istemaal kar bijepi kii chunavi ranneeti taiyaar karne main madad kii thi or iske falswaroop narendra modi ke netritv main centre main bijepi kii sarkaar bani thi
 Prashant, who has a good experience of the way PM Modi and BJP work, is now preparing a new plan for the Congress, which uses the old methods to some extent and is largely dependent on the Gandhi family
 saarvajanik chakachaundh se dur 38 varshiya prashanth ke paas saath kaam karne vaali researchrs kii team he, jo vibhinn aankadon kaa vishleshan kar voton ko seat par milane vaali jeet main tabdeel karne kii ranneeti banane main madad karte hai
 Election strategist Prashant Kishore has the right to contact Rahul Gandhi at any time
 prashanth kishor ke najdiki sutara ke anusaar, prashanth ko 'freehand' diya gaya he or unhen kabhi bhi samay rahul gandhi ke kisi masale par charchaa karne kaa adhikaar hasil he
 Prashant Kishore is currently focused on moving away from the guardian system and bringing in new faces at the grassroots level and instilling enthusiasm among the workers
 tippaniyan Sources reveal that Kishore wants to present the Congress as a composite national party of India
 isaki pramukh pratidwandvi party bijepi par uttejk bhaashanon or alpsankhyakon kii keemat par hindu samaaj kii praathamikta vaala agenda pesh karne kaa aarope lagata rah he

 duusari rashtriya party bijepi he yah puure bharat kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karti kyonki yah sabaki or sabase liye party kii avadharana par khari nahin utarati
 ' 'gandhi' kii ore sanchalit kii ja rahi party ko pichley saptaah us samay sharmindagi kaa saamana karnaa padaa jab assam main use pradhanmantri narendra modi kii bijepi ke haathon karaari haar mili
 In Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal too, the party / its alliance suffered defeat
 aise main janata ke bich congress party kaa cheharaa maane ja rahe rahul gandhi ke saamne sabase badi chunauti ( varsh 2019 ke aam chunaav ke pehle) agle varsh desh ke sabase bade rajya uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav main acha pradarshan karke kaaryakartaaon main josh kaa sanchaar karne kii he
 Elections to be held in UP and Punjab states in the year 2017 can determine to an extent who is going to be the next PM

 upi ke chunaav ke mahatv ko samajhate hue rahul gandhi ne party kii ranneeti taiyaar karne main prashanth kishor kii madad lene kaa faisla kiya he
 Prashant Kishore is the same person who helped the BJP formulate the electoral strategy in 2014 general election by using modern technology and as a result a BJP government was formed at the center under Narendra Modi

 Away from the public glare, the 38-year-old Prashant has a team of researchers working together to analyze various figures and help him devise a strategy to convert votes into seats won
 chunaav ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ko rahul gandhi se kisi bhi samay sampark karne kaa adhikaar hasil he
 According to a source close to Prashant Kishore, Prashant has been given 'freehand' and has the right to discuss any issue of Rahul Gandhi at any time
 prashanth kishor kaa jor philhal sangrakshakwaadi vyavastha se dur hatakar jamini str par nae chehre laane or kaaryakartaaon main josh foonkane par he
 The comments sutara bataate hai ki kishor bharat kii ek samgr neshnal party ke rup main congress ko pesh karnaa chaahate hai

 For the BJP, winning in the Karnataka elections is like stepping on the first ladder of Congress-free South India
 congress se pehle yahaan par bijepi kii sarkaar thi
 The party has considerable network at the grassroots level
 iske baavjood bijepi ke liye bhi ye aasaan ladaai nahin he
 This is the reason why BJP does not want to repeat the mistake of 2013 assembly elections
 rajya kii satta main vaapasi ko sunishchit karne ke liye kai factor bijepi ke paksh main ja sakate hai
 1
 modi lahar kaa bharosakarnataka kii satta main dobaaraa se vaapasi ke liye bijepi kaa sabase bada bharosa modi lahar par he
 After losing power in 2013, the BJP won 17 of the 28 Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka in the 2014 elections and got around 43 per cent of the votes
 jabaki 2009 kii tulana main bijepi kii seat or vot fisadi donon kam hue the
 The BJP believes that Prime Minister Modi is the leader who draws votes and in his name people will vote for the BJP in the assembly elections

 Yeddyurappa's revolt in 2013 was the reason for bjp's defeat
 pichley chunaav ke nateezon ko dekhen to bijepi ko kareeb 20 fisadi or yediurppa kii party ko 10 fisadi vot mili the
 While the Congress came to power with 36 percent of the vote
 isiilie 2014 ke chunaav se pehle narendra modi ne yediurppa ko saath milaayaa tha
 The result was better
 yediurppa ke naam par vidhansabha ke siyaasi jang main bijepi lingayat samudaay ke vot ko apane paale main rakhana chaahati he

 They choose good stories
 actaron se acha kaam lete hai or kahani tathaa editing ko kaaphi sadha hua rakhte hai
 All these things also get reflected in 'baby'
 kahani tite he
 The country is full of devotion
 lekin niraj pandeya film main apana focus khote nahin hai, or aisa hi puri film main bhi najar aata he
 Where every tenant is very busy in his work
 kahani raftaar se chalati he
 But the film gives a glimpse of films like 'D Day' and 'holiday'
 kahani main kitna damkuch chuninda afasaron kaa paanch saal kaa'baby'naam kaa mishan he, iskaa sirf ekmaatr uddeshy desh ke dushmano ko nestanabood karnaa he
 Its officers work in hiding their identity and sacrifice for the country
 isi tarah kaa ek adhikari he akshay kumaar
 He has to hide the terrorist (KK Menon) so that the country can be protected
 kahani mentapasi pannu, rana daggubatti or anupam kher jaise kairactor aate jate rahete hai
 However, the film does not have much time for factors like love and comedy
 seen kaaphi lambey hai
 There is not much newness in the story but there are many shocking moments
 film kaa diarection or niraj kaa treetment film kii euaspy hai
 Star Apneer Niraj Pandey's films try to keep the story high
 'baby' bhi aisi hi film he
 Akshay Kumar's selection is perfect
 ve bhaagate hai or acshan karte hai to lagata he ki yah banda aisa kar saktaa he
 Anyway, he has given hit films like 'special 26' with Neeraj
 film main danni badhiya lage hai
 Although the director has not given any other character a chance to emerge, his entire focus has been on Akshay Kumar
 taapasi pannu ko thodaa or dekhne kaa man karata he, vah acshan karti hai, majaa aata he
 Anupam Kher is also OK
 rana to bolte hue bahut kam hi dikhe hai
 It is a good gift for the fans of Neeraj
 phir akshay kumaar ke phans ke liye bhi yah film khaas he kyonki unke star alag andaaj main dikhenge, ekadam gambhir vaale
 His imprint is nowhere to be seen in the film
 puraa style niraj kaa he
 Word of mouth will do a lot of work regarding the film
 ise chaar din kaa weekend mil rahaa he
 Then the pace of the story, amazing editing and patriotic spirit is also favorable for this week
 is hafte 'doli kii doli' relies hui he or film puri tarah alag tewaron kii he to 'baby' ko darshak milane main zyada dikkat aane vaali he nahin
 The film is very big budget, so the weekend will be very important for it

 co / eyppzimriv— HINA KHAN (@eyehinakhan)may 18, 2018 The government has stated that there is a plan to gradually replace 10 rupee notes in the country with 10 rupee coins
 loksabhaa main e ganeshamurti ke ek prashn ke likhit uttar main vitt rajyamantri namo narayan meena ne bataaya ki bhartiya rigerv bank ne suchit kiya he ki desh main 10 rupee ke noton ko dhire-dhire 10 rupee ke sikkon se badalane kii yojana he
 He said that the supply of the required quantity of coins depends on the capacity of the mints
 mantri ne kaha ki 10 rupee moolyavarg ke bank note kaa ausat jivan lagbhag 9 se 10 maah hota he or isaki ausat laagat prati note 96 paisa he

 The last promotion of officers from indo-tibetan Border Police, ie ITBP to commandant level, took place in 2012-13 itself
 is vajah se bharat-china seemaa par oonche pahaado se lekar naksal prabhavit ilaakon main tainaat adhikari or jawan maayoos hai
 The special thing is that due to lack of promotion, more than 60 Inspector rank officers retired without promotion

 Is directly the post of DG
 itibipi ke purv diaiji jivies choudhary ke mutabik, pramotion nahin milane ke kaaran adhikari se lekar jawan tak ke manobal par bura asar pad rah he
 Experts say that it started in 2010 when the government planned to merge the IPS cadre into the main cadre
 isaki kii vajah se pramotion main rukaawat ai
 The matter has also been challenged in the court, but so far the government has not taken any decision on it
 is vajah seitibipimen commandent ke 40 pad, second-in-cmand ke 40 pad, dipti commandent ke 300 pad, assistant commandent ke 250 pad ke alaava itani hi sankhya main inspector, sab inspector, eesai or pradhan aarakshak ke pad rikt pade hai
 Chaudhary says, "if the Home Ministry and ITBP officials tried seriously in this regard only three years ago, then such a situation would not have arisen
 itibipi ke javaanon or adhikariyon kii niyukti samvedansheel sthanon par hoti he, agar inhen sahi samay par pramotion mili, to vah oonchi rank tak pahunch sakenge or unka manobal bhi ooncha ho sakegaa

 Employee Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) Interest rate on PF for the year 2015-16 8
 75 fisadi se ghataakar 8
 70 percent can do
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar vitt mantralay kii ore se isaki adhisuchana shram mantralay ko bhej di gai he
 After the reduction in the interest rates of small budget schemes, the government is now preparing to cut the interest rates on PF
 shram mantralay ke sutron kii maane to pichley 50 varshon ke itihaas main aisa pehali baar hoga jab karmchaariyon ko pief par milane vaala byaaj, jo ki milanaa chahie, usase kam milegaa
 That too with the intervention of the ministry, which has nothing to do with the money of this trust
 shram mantralay kii ore se pief par 8
 It was recommended to pay 80 per cent interest, which was not accepted by the Finance Ministry
 karmchaariyon ko nahin milegaa labhavitt mantralayane varsh 2015-16 ke liye pief par prastaavit byaaj dar 8
 80 to 8 per cent
 70 fisadi karne ko kaha he jisaki adhisuchana shram mantralay ko bhej di gai he
 If this notification is issued, then the rate of interest received last year is 8
 75 fisadi byaaj dar kii tulana main 0
 Will be 05 percent less
 shram mantralay ke is nirnay se karmchaariyon ko varsh 2015-16 ke liye jo phayda mil saktaa tha, vah ab nahin milegaa
 This will save surplus in excess EPFOK account from Rs 1062 crore this year
 yah paisa un karmchaariyon kaa he jinaki tankhwaah se har maheene pief kaa paisa katataa he
 On this money, EPFO earns money and distributes the profits among the employees
 ipiefo ne kii thi 8
 80% interest rate recommendation Earlier, Labor Minister Bandaru Dattatreya had said after the 211st meeting of the EPF Central Board of Trustees (CBT) in Chennai on February 16 that we are committed to the well being of workers, so this time we have 8 employees
 80 fisadi byaaj dene kaa nirnay liya he
 Although EPFO 8
 95 fisadi byaaj dene kii sthiti main tha or iske baad bhi ipiefo ke khate main 91 karod rupee sarplus batch jate
 But 8 at the board of trustees meeting
 80 fisadi byaaj dene kaa nirnay liya gaya tha jiskaa virodh us samay trustee ke sadasyon ne bhi kiya tha
 Members of the Board of Trustees as per the income of EPF 8
 95 fisadi byaaj die jane kii maang kii thi lekin board main is par sahmati nahin ban saki
 Who will benefit from this? If 8 from the Ministry of Labor
 70 fisadi byaaj dar kii ghoshnaa kii jaati he to iskaa phayda un bade gharaanon ke pief treston ko bhi hoga jo wo khud sanchalit karte hai
 If 8 on EPFO PF
 70 fisadi byaaj dekar 1062 karod rupee apane khate main sarplus rakhata he to nijee sanghathanon ke pief treston ko bhi isi prakaar kaa phayda hoga
 2
 5 karod logon ko bonus de sakati hayhaalanki kuch din pehle yah khabar ai thi ki ipiefo saal 2015-16 ke liye byaaj dar badhaane kii jagah apane upabhoktaaon ko 750 karod rupee kaa bonus dene par bhi vichaar kar rahaa he
 The bonus will be arranged for the same subscribers who have contributed for 12 consecutive months
 ipiefo ke internal estimet ke mutabik agar is prastaav ko manjuuri de di jaati he to iske 5 karod sabsakribers main se lagbhag 2
 5 crore people can get bonus this year
 vaise is prakaar kii kisi yojana par abhi koi nirnay nahin liya gaya he
 Significantly, recently, the government had reduced the interest rate on many small savings

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) demand, which is demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the issue of coal block allocation, is now set to cancel the allocation and get the inquiry done, while the government is not ready to step back
 sarkaar ne somvaar ko in donon maangon ko khaarij kar diya
 Due to uproar by BJP members, no work could be done in Parliament on Monday on the 9th day and the proceedings of both the houses were adjourned for the day
 koyala block aavanton par niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (sieji) kii report ko lekar pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke istife kii maang kar rahi he
 But now showing some leniency, BJP has said that if all coal block allocations are canceled and a fair inquiry is ordered on the CAG report, then it will allow Parliament to function
 baharhaal, gatirodh dur hone ke koi sanket bhi nahin mil rahe hai
 The terms put by the BJP were rejected by the central government
 sarkaar ne sabhi dalon se is mudde par bahes ke liye sahamat hone kii apil kii
 It, however, admitted that the purpose of allocating coal blocks has come as a shock
 kendriya vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram said, "it is useless to demand the resignation of the Prime Minister
 
 They know that it will never happen
 jahaan tak koyala block aavanton radd karne kii baat he to antar mantralayan samooh kii madhya sitambar tak report aane ke baad hi karrwai hogi
 " chidambaram ne kaha, "koyala block aavanton karne kii niti 1993 se lagu he lekin iske uddeshy ko jhatka laga he
 There are many mines which have not been mined
 " Rejecting the need for a judicial inquiry into the allocation of coal blocks, he said that the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government had planned to change the auction policy in 2004
 unhone kaha ki koyala aavanton ke mudde par sansad main bahes honi chahie
 "only when there will be a face-to-face debate, many things will come out of it
 main bhaajapa se apil karata hum ki sansad main is par bahes kare
 " chidambaram ke anusaar 47 aavantit koyala block nitiyon par khare utre hai, 58 block, jinhen notice jari kiya gaya he, nitiyon par khare nahin utre hai
 Giving details of the blocks, he said that coal production has started in 30 blocks, while in 70, coal production will start in the coming days and 58 need environmental clearance
 kendriya sansadeey kaary mantri pawan kumaar bansal ne kaha ki 75 pratishat se adhik saansad sansad kii kaarywahi sucharu rup se chalane dene ke paksh main hai, lekin bhaajapa koyala block aavanton ke mudde par sansad kii kaarywahi baadhit karne par amada he
 Bansal also said that the coal blocks in which production has not started, they are being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
 bansal ne kaha, "75 pratishat saansad sadan kii kaarywahi chalane dene ke paksh main hai, lekin bhaajapa jid par adi he
 " bansal ne kaha, "hamen kanoon kii uchit prakriya kaa paalan karnaa he
 We (at the time of allocation of coal blocks) took consent from the Chief Ministers of the BJP
 " Bansal said that the process of taking appropriate action in this case is on and CBI is investigating the necessary cases
 unhone kaha, "bhaajapa kii maang janata ko gumraah karne ke liye he
 " kendriya kanoon mantri salmaan khurshid ne koyala block aavanton radd kiye jane kii maang khaarij karte hue kaha ki vipaksh congress netritv vaali samprag sarkaar ko is mudde par gatirodh dur karne kaa koi nishpaksh vikalp nahin de rahi he
 Khurshid said that the opposition's demand is like offering an honorable funeral to someone who hangs himself
 khurshid ne kaha, "vah jo kah rahe hai vah kuch aisa he ki 'agar aap faansee laga len, to main aapkaa sammanjanak antim sanskaar karuunga'
 " khurshid ne kaha, "ve kah rahe hai ki main aapkaa dahinaa haath kaat luungaa, lekin dahinaa pair chhod duungaa
 We do not want a clever choice, we want a proper alternative
 " Khurshid said, "they know how cancellation of coal block allocation will affect the sentiments of the investor and the economy? The disruption of Parliament is not only hurting the wealth of the country, but we are not able to pass those bills
" We have far-reaching consequences
 " Khurshid also accused the BJP that it did not want the anti-corruption bills to be passed
 unhone kaha, "ham jin bhrashtachar nivarak pramukh vidheyakon ko paarit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai, ve sabhi ko avaruddh kar rahe hai
 This makes it clear that they are restless about whether there should be transparency
 " Khurshid defended the allocation saying that it was in the national interest
 unhone kaha, "koyala block aavanton main koi gadabadi nahin he
 This was done in the national interest
 " The Law Minister said, “there are many ways to advance the national interest
 
 Communists have their own ways, capitalists have their own ways
 
 His conduct is a display of narrow thinking, which is contrary to the beliefs of democracy
 " Khurshid said, "we cannot allow their ideological violence on our democracy
 yah un vichaaron ke bilkul khilaaf he, jinpar loktantr tikaa hua he
 " is bich, pradhanmantri manmohan singh par hamalaa jari rakhte hue rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne kaha, "koyala aavanton main hue ghotaale par sarkaar ne koi pratikriya nahin di he
 The Prime Minister has cited his silence
 adaalat main aaropee ko chup rahane kaa adhikaar he lekin ek pradhanmantri aisa nahin kar saktaa
 " jetali ne kaha, "vah us pad par hai jo sabase adhik javabdeh he
 Accountability and silence cannot run together
 " jetali ne yah bhi kaha ki bhaajapa ne pradhanmantri ke istife kii maang chodi nahin he
 It may be known that the Prime Minister had said recently that his silence is better than thousands of replies
 pradhanmantri ne kaha tha, "hajaaron javaabon se acchhee he meri khamoshi, na jane kitne sawaalon kii aabru rakhi
 "comments varisht makapa netaa seetaram yechuri ne samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha, "ham koyala block aavanton radd kiye jane or unki jaanch kii maang karte aa rahe hai
 The government should now take steps in this direction as the BJP is also making demands according to its idea
 " The monsoon session of Parliament ends on September 7
 lekin pichley ek saptaah se bhaajapa ke virodh ke kaaran sansad kii kaarywahi nahin chal pai he
 The BJP is demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) on coal block allocation
 bhaajapa sadasyon ke hangaame ke kaaran sansad main 9wein din somvaar ko bhi koi kaamkaaj nahin ho paaya or donon sadanon kii kaarywahi dinabhar ke liye sthagit kar di gai
 Demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) on coal block allocation
 lekin ab thodi narmi dikhaate hue bhaajapa ne kaha he ki yadi sabhi koyala block aavanton radd kar die jaaen or sieji kii report par nishpaksh jaanch ke aadesh de die jaaen to vah sansad kii kaarywahi chalane degi
 However, there are no signs of any deadlock being resolved
 bhaajapa kii ore se rakhi gai sharton ko centre sarkaar ne khaarij kar diya
 The government appealed to all parties to agree to a debate on the issue
 usne haalanki sweekaar kiya ki koyala block aavantit karne ke uddeshy ko jhatka laga he
 Union Finance Minister P
 chidambaram ne kaha, "pradhanmantri ke istife kii maang karnaa bekaar he
 
 ve jaanate hai ki yah kabhi nahin hoga
 As far as the cancellation of coal block allocation is concerned, action will be taken only after the report of the Inter Ministerial Group by mid-september
 " Chidambaram said, "the policy of allocation of coal blocks has been in force since 1993 but its purpose has suffered a setback
 kai khadaan hai jinamein khanan nahin hua he
 " koyala block aavanton kii nyaayik jaanch kii jarurat ko khaarij karte hue unhone kaha ki sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar ne 2004 main nilaamee kii niti ko badalane kii sochi thi
 He said that the issue of coal allocation should be debated in Parliament
 "aamane-saamne jab bahes hogi tabhi isse kai baaten nikalakar saamne aaengi
 i appeal to the BJP to debate this in Parliament
 " According to Chidambaram, 47 allocated coal blocks have met the policies, 58 blocks, which have been issued notices, have not met the policies
 unhone block kaa vivaran dete hue kaha ki 30 blokon main koyale kaa utpaadan armbh ho chukaa he, jabaki 70 main aane vaale dinon main koyala utpaadan shuru ho jayega or 58 ko paryaavarniya manjuuri kii jarurat he
 Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal said that more than 75 percent of the mps were in favor of allowing the Parliament to function smoothly, but the BJP was bent on disrupting Parliament proceedings on the issue of coal block allocation
 bansal ne yah bhi kaha ki jin koyala block main utpaadan shuru nahin ho paaya he, kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) dwaara unki jaanch kii ja rahi he
 Bansal said, "75 per cent of the mps are in favor of allowing the house to function, but the BJP is adamant
 " Bansal said, "we have to follow due process of law
 hamane (koyala blokon ke aavanton ke samay) bhaajapa ke mukhyamantriyon se sahmati lee thi
 " bansal ne kaha ki is maamle main uchit karrwai karne kii prakriya shuru he or sibiai jaruri maamalon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 He said, "bjp's demand is to mislead the public
 " Union Law Minister Salman Khurshid rejected the demand for cancellation of coal block allocation, saying the opposition was not giving any fair alternative to the Congress-led UPA government to remove the deadlock over the issue
 khurshid ne kaha ki vipaksh kii maang khud se faansee lagane vaale kisi vyakti ko sammanjanak antim sanskaar kii peshkash karne jaisi he
 Khurshid said, "what he is saying is something like 'if you get hanged, i will do your respectful funeral'
" " Khurshid said, "they are saying that i will cut off your right hand, but leave the right leg
 ham koi chaalaaki bharaa vikalp nahin chaahate, ham uchit vikalp chaahate hai
 " khurshid ne kaha, "unhen pataa he ki koyala block aavanton radd kiye jane se niveshak kii bhaawanaaon or arthvyavastha par kya asar hoga? sansad baadhit hone se na keval desh kaa dhan nuksaan ho rahaa he, balki ham un vidheyakon ko nahin paarit kar paa rahe hen, jinke doorgaami parinaam hai
 " khurshid ne bhaajapa par yah aarope bhi lagaaya ki vah bhrashtachar nivarak vidheyakon ko bhi nahin paarit hone dena chaahati
 He said, "the key anti-corruption bills we are trying to pass are blocking everyone
 isse yah spasht hota he ki ve is baat ko lekar baichaiyn hai ki kahin paardarshita na aa jaae
 " khurshid ne yah kehete hue aavanton kaa bachaav kiya ki yah rashtrahit main he
 He said, "there is no problem in allocation of coal blocks
 aisa rashtrahit main kiya gaya tha
 " kanoon mantri ne kaha, "rashtrahit ko aage badhaane ke kai tareeke hai
 
 communiston ke apane tareeke hai, poonjivadiyon ke apane tareeke hai
 
 unka aacharan sankeern soch kaa pradarshan he, jo loktantr kii manyataon ke vipareet he
 " khurshid ne kaha, "ham apane loktantr par unki vaicharik hinsa kii anumati nahin de sakate
 It is completely against the ideas on which democracy rests
 " Meanwhile, continuing the attack on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said, "the government has not responded to the scam in coal allocation
" pradhanmantri ne apni chuppi kaa hawala diya he
 The accused in the court has the right to remain silent but a Prime Minister cannot do so
 " Jaitley said, "he is in the post that is most accountable
 javabdehi or chuppi ek saath nahin chal sakate
 "jaitley also said that the BJP has not given up the demand for the Prime Minister's resignation
 gyaat ho ki pradhanmantri ne pichley dinon kaha tha ki hajaaron javaabon se behatar unki khamoshi he
 The Prime Minister had said, "my silence is better than thousands of answers, i don't know how many questions were kept

 maharashtra main gir gai BJP sarkaradavendra fadanvis ne diya istifnjit pavaar ne bhi diya istifamaharashtra kii siyaasi uthapatak ke bich supreme court ne devendra fadanvis sarkaar ko bahumat pareekshan ke liye buudhvaar shaam paanch baje tak kaa samay diya
 After this, political stirring from Maharashtra to Delhi intensified and with the court's decision, the BJP lost half the political battle
 iske baad dilli main pradhanmantri narendra modi, bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or party ke kaaryakari adhyaksh jepi nadda ke bich baithak hui
 From here the bjp's political plan changed
 maharashtra kii bachikhuchi baaji bijepi ne ajit pavaar ke istife ke saath apane haathon se gavaan diya
 Please tell that Shiv sena-congress-ncp was engaged in the exercise of forming a government together
 isi bich shanivaar kii subah devendra fadanvis ne mukhyamantri or ajit pavaar ne dipti siem pad kii shapath lekar sabko chaunkaa diya tha
 The congress-ncp and Shiv Sena then approached the Supreme Court against the Governor's order, questioning this way of forming the government
 supreme court ne mangalvaar ko floor test, protem spikar, open ballat, live telecost karaane kaa aadesh diya
 The BJP lost half the battle as soon as the Supreme Court verdict came
 supreme court ne devendra fadanvis sarkaarko bahumat siddh karne ke liye buudhvaar shaam paanch baje tak kaa samay nirdhaarit kiya
 Whereas, the governor gave time till 7 December
 supreme court ke faisle ke baad bijepi ke liye bahumat ke aankade kii sankhya jutanaa aasaan nahin tha
 That is why half the political bet was lost with the BJP decision
 supreme court ke faisle ke baad dilli main pradhanmantri narendra modi, bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or party ke kaaryakari adhyaksh jepi nadda ke saath dopaher ek baje baithak hui he
 This meeting was held in Maharashtra for the political struggle
 isi baithak ke baad se bijepi kaa siyaasi plan badalane laga
 It is believed that the bjp's top leadership had better understand that in such a short time it would not be easy for Devendra Fadnavis to pass the floor test, as the MLA who accompanied Ajit Pawar had gone back to the NCP camp
 dilli main modi-shah or nadda kii baithak ke saath hi mumbai main ajit pavaar ensipi ke diggaj netaaon ke saath baithak kar rahe the
 In this meeting, leaders like ncp's Chhagan Bhujwal, Praful Patel and Jayant Patil, persuaded Ajit Pawar to bring him back to the party
 ajit pavaar is baithak se sidhe nikle or devendra fadanvis ke ghar pahunche
 There he said that we do not have majority data
 isi ke saath ajit pavaar ne dipti siem pad se istipha dekar apane bhai ke ghar chale gaye
 2 close to Ajit Pawar
 30 baje istife kii khabar aane ke saath bijepi baikfoot par aa gai
 Devendra Fadnavis called a meeting of all his mlas at Wankhede Stadium at 8 pm on Tuesday
 mana ja rahaa tha ki iske jariye bijepi apana shakti pradarshan karegi
 But after Ajit Pawar's resignation, the entire political plan of the BJP failed
 devendra fadanvis ne puri tarah se sarender kar diya
 Fadnavis called the press conference and announced his resignation as Chief Minister
 unhone kaha ki ajit pavaar ne mujhase milakar kaha main gathbandhan jari nahin rakh saktaa or alag hone kii baat kahi
 He said that we no longer have a majority
 isi ke saath devendra fadanvis sarkaar gir gai

 saath hi newjiland ke khilaaf gharelu pichon par team india kaa record bhi behad shandaar rahaa he
 Hence, India, adorned with strong batting and turn-based pitches, will surely win this historic Test as long as the weather supports, we believe
 chaliye aapako bataate hai wo paanch kaaran kyon hamaara aisa maananaa he ki team india siries kii shuruyaat aitihaasik test main jeet ke saath karegi?turn leti pich par phiraki kii fanstim india ke tarkash main behtareen spinners hai
 The biggest problem facing New Zealand will be the struggle of the Indian masters like Ashwin, Jadeja and Mishra to save their wickets, but here they will also have to put a big total in front of Team India
 itnaa hi nahin jababhartiya timballebaaji ke liye utregi tab unhen iske dhurandhar ballebaajon ko jald se jald out bhi karnaa hoga jisase wo match drow karaane sthiti tak bhi pahunchane main kaamyaab ho saken
 But here the Kiwi team seems weak
 bhale hi unke paas leg spinner ish sodhi, orthodox of spinner mark craig or baayen haath ke spinner mishael centner kii spin tikdi he lekin in teenon ke paas kul 98 test viketon kaa anubhav he
 While Santner and Craig are playing against India for the first time, Sodhi Kotim has only one match experience against India
 usamen wo 21 overs main koi wicket nahin le sake the
 Sodhi, however, has the experience of taking 35 wickets in 13 Tests and Santner taking 15 wickets in seven Tests
 in teenon main jis ek gendbaaj par sabhi kii najar tiki hogi wo hai craig
 Craig, who took 48 wickets in 14 Tests, is also playing against India for the first time but one thing to remember here is that against the off spin, Indian batsmen tend to be a little weak, so the Indian batsmen have to be smart against Craig
 
 balle ke ustaadon se bharmaar team indiyabharatiya team main jahaan viraat kohli, ajinkya rahane, rohit sharma, lokesh rahul, murali vijay, cheteshwar pujaara jaise sheersh kram ke ballebaaj hai
 Also an all-rounder like Ashwin is also present
 jo test maichon main 34
 Plays at an average of 26 runs
 ab tak chaar shatkeey or chah ardhashtakeey pari khel chukaa he
 Team India has not lost a Test for a year, where India is playing its 500th Test, while it is the 413th Test of the Kiwi team
 pichley ek saal se bhartiya team ne ek bhi test match nahin ganvaaya he
 India has won 7 out of 10 Test matches played during this period
 team isi july-agast main westeindies se jeet kar apana 500waan match khilne pahunchi he
 So New Zealand's team lost five matches to Australia and South Africa in 11 Tests played since November 2015, while winning four matches against Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka
 pichley hi test main africa ke khilaaf kiwi team donon pariyon main mahaj 399 ran hi bana saki
 That is, the pan of India itself looks heavy here
 newjiland par test main haaavee rahaa bharatbharat or newjiland ke bich test record par ek najar daalane par yah saaf ho jaataa he ki cricket ke is formet main hameshaa hi team india kaa palada baari rahaa he
 a total of 54 Test matches have been played between the two teams so far
 inamen se bharat ko 18 main jabaki newjiland ko keval 10 main jeet mili he
 Out of the last five Test matches played between these two teams, India have won three while New Zealand could win only one
 bharat main 28 saalon se nahin jiti kiwi timanujiland kaa bharat main record bhi kuch khaas prabhavit nahin karata
 Out of the total 31 Test matches played here, India won 13 Test matches 
 jabaki bhartiya pichon par newjiland ko keval do jeet mili he
 First in 1969 in Vidarbha and second in 1988 in Wankhede
 yani pichley 28 saalon se newjiland ko bharat main ek test jeet kii talash he
 Team India is a lion on home pitches: Team India has won 62 Tests in the last 40 years on its home pitch
 vahiin is dauraan use keval 19 test maichon main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Since 2008, this record is even more fun as it has lost only three Tests in this period and won 18
 2012-13 main england se mili haar ke sivaa pichley chah saalon main team india ne apane aath home siries main se saat jite hai
 Tests will also be played in Kolkata and Indore after Kanpur, but considering the Indian spin trio, the strong batting order and the great cricketer of cricket in the form of captain Kohli, the Kiwi team will still be desirous of a win in this tour

 in lafjon se milakar bani ek shaks kii yah daastaan, jise padhakar aapako pataa lagegaa ki kaise khap panchayaton ke farmaan ke aage police or prashasan aaj bhi laachaar hai
 The incident is from Nagaur district of Rajasthan

 However, the police do not consider the crime on Sheopat to be a crime and even threatens punishment to drive them away from the police station
 kya he maamladansal, shyopatnath kii galati yah he ki usne ek ladki se pyaar kiya or use bhaga kar le gaya
 Sheopatnath and his family say that the girl and her family implicated her in false love
 jiske baad pakade jane par ladki ke bhaaiyon ne peedit ko bandhak banaakar rakhaa or aprakritik sex kii sajaa bhi di
 Not only this, Sheopatnath was put in a cage and urinated to drink water
 jaankaree ke anusaar, dihadi mazdooree karke do bade bhaaiyon ke saath guzar-basar karne vaale shyopatnath kii haal hi sagaai hui
 According to the ritual, he also paid three lakh rupees to the girl's family as a loan repayment of milk
 uski shaadi haryana ke ek gaanv main honi thi, lekin jab shaadi kii baari ai to shyopatnath kii hone vaali saas ne use apane paas bulaakar apni bahu ke saath pyaar main fansaane kaa naatak rachaa
 After being trapped in false love, the chopp girl came to Didwana from Adra village in Haryana, after which the mother-in-law registered a case of driving the daughter-in-law away from the police
 police maamla rafa-dfa karne main jutipyar-muhabbat kii is juthi kahani main fanse shyopatnath ko khap panchayat ne asahneeya yatnaaen di, vahiin ab apane bade bhaaiyon ke saath vah chaar maheenon se nyaay kii aas lagaae baitha he

 bharat antariksh vigyaan ke maamle main duniya bhar ke kai diggaj deshon ke saath takkar le rahaa he
 On 15 July, ISRO is about to launch its second moon mission, Chandrayaan-2
 yah moon mishan hollywood film 'avengers andgem' se 65
 17 percent cheaper
 yani film ke bajet se aadhe se bhi kam keemat
 The total cost of Chandrayaan-2 is around 850 crores
 chandrayan-2 kii kul laagat kareeb 12
 4 crores dollars (850 crores Rs
 ) he
 3 in it
 1 karod dollar (212 karod ru
 ) Is the cost of rocket launch
 9
 $ 3 million (rs 637 crore) of Chandrayaan satellite
 yah laagat avengers kii laagat kii aadhi se bhi kam he
 The estimated budget of this film was 2440 crores
 jaaniye
 
 
 How much cheaper than any country, India's moon mission, before this, America, Russia and China have landed their rover and lander on the moon
 bharat aisa karne vaala chauthaa desh hoga
 But do you know how much India's Chandrayaan-2 mission is cheaper than China's Chang-4 lunar mission launched in 2017
 chandrayan-2 mishan kii kul laagat kareeb 850 karod rupye he, jabaki 2014 main america dwaara bheje gaye moon mishan LDEE kii kul laagat 1919 karod rupye thi
 In LDEE, there was only orbiter
 jabaki, isse kam main isro orbitor, lander or rover bhej rahaa he
 The cost of China's Chang-4 Moon mission was 5759 crores
 vahiin, rus kaa 1966 main bheja gaya moon mishan agar aaj kii taarikh main bhejte to laagat aati kareeb 13,712 karod rupye
 That is, Indian space mission cost 55 from America
 70 fisadi, china se 85
 24 percent and 93 from Russia
 80 fisadi kam he
 Sending satellites from India is less expensive than the countries sending satellites into space
 bharat se videshi upgrahon ko antariksh main bhejnaa in kaarnon se sasta padataa he, kyonki
 
 
 Labor is cheaper in India than abroad
 centre sarkaar isro ko kai prakaar ke chhot detii he jisase kisi bhi mishan ke laagat main kami aati he
 In other countries, the process of sending foreign commercial satellites from government space agency rockets is quite complex
 isamen niyam, samjhaute or kanoon jaisi kai adchane hai
 However, Antrix, the ISRO business unit in India, does this
 isro kabhi bhi kisi pelod, yantra, rocket yaa satellite se judi technology ko videshon se nahin kharidta
 ISRO scientists themselves research it and prepare it
 phir unka upyog karte hai
 Hachina from China, India's biggest competition, is also a big market for sending satellites to space at low prices
 isliye bharat kii china se pratiyogita hoti rahati he
 India will be able to challenge China only when it sends large satellites
 kyonki, bade upgrahon ko bhejne se zyada paisa aata he
 However, it is not able to leave the satellite weighing too much
 china antariksh abhiyaan par bharat kii tulana main 2
 Spends 5 times more
 isliye uske paas bharat se 0
 4 times more capacity to send satellites into space
 antariksh program main bharat kaa niveshpichley ek dashak main bharat ne antariksh program ko lekar bada nivesh kiya he
 On an average, about 65 to 70 billion rupees have been spent on space related research every year
 agar 2022 kaa antariksh main maanavyan bhejne kaa bharat kaa mishan safal hota he to uske baad isro chandramaa or surya ke mishan par jute jayega
 Through India's Solar Mission aditya-l1, ISRO hopes to make a big contribution in the field of solar storms and energy
 baraat or baraati to aapane bahut dekhe honge, lekin kya kabhi besharmon kii baraat bhi dekhi he? dilli ke nazadik ghaziabad main jab besharmon kii aisi hi ek baraat nikali, to dekhanevaale bas dekhte hi rah gaye
 Starting from a hotel among hundreds of people, the procession went to a nearby police station
 is dauraan anginat ankhen unka peechha karti raheen
 In fact, the parade of boys and girls caught after the police raid came from a hotel in Ghaziabad near Delhi, which has been talked about for a long time
 yah racket kitna purana he, iskaa andaaza isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki shanivaar subah jab police ne is hotel main dabish di, to iske alag-alag kamaron se police ko koi ek, do, chaar, das nahin, balki puure 112 ladke-ladkiyaan aapattijanak haalat main mili
 Everything had been going on here for months and openly
 lekin bhari aabaadi ke bich police or kaanoon ke paharedaaron ke hote hue akhir yah sab mumkin kaise tha? vaise yah bhi ek dilachasp kahani he
 This racket of Jismfaroshi would come out so big, even the police did not think
 yahi vajah he ki jab ek baar hotel se pakade gaye logon kii gitni shuru hui, to phir yah ginati chalati chali gai
 In the end, the situation arose as if this arrest was not taking place at the base of Jismafaroshi, but in a political rally
 chhapemari main police ke haath itane sandigdh jode lage hai ki wo khud nahin samaj paa rahi he ki akhir itane logon ko wo giraftaar kare to kaise kare or giraftaar karne ke baad thane le jaae, to kaise le jaae
 Therefore, the police first seizes the boys and girls caught in the objectionable condition from the hotel rooms separately
 yani ek taraf ladke or duusari taraf ladkiyaan
 Since there is a fear of slander in this case, everyone caught is hiding their mouths as soon as they sit down
 ab police ek-ek kar logon kii gitni shuru karti he
 one two three four five
 
 
 or is tarah puure 112 logon kii gitni karne ke baad police ko bhi yah ahsaas ho jaataa he ki unhone kitna bada haath maaraa he
 So, now she not only forces a separate force, but also buses to take everyone from here
 kuch aise, jaise aam taur par reliyon main giraftaar honevaale kisi siyaasi party ke kaaryakartaaon ko giraftaar kar kahin le jane ke liye mangvayi jaati he
 Then one by one, 56 boys are put in one bus and the same number of girls in the other bus leave for the police station
 zaahir he, der se sahi, police kii is karrwai se aasapaas ke logon ne ab raahat kii saans lee he
 Anyway, the police has just raided and arrested the suspected couples
 inamen koun-si jodi aashiq-mashooq kii he, koun-si jismfaroshon kii or koun-si najayas rishte kii, isaki padtaal to abhi baaki he
 College girls are also among the businessmen
 
 
 besharmon kii is baraat main kya sirf jismfaroshi ke dhandhebaaz hi shaamil the, yaa phir koi or bhi tha, jo is baraat kaa hissaa bana tha? police ne jab gajiabad ke is hotel main dabish di, to ek or hi kahani saamne aa gai
 The procession exposed many faces including businessmen, college girls, professionals, housewives and others
 ghaziabad police ne jab jismfaroshi kaa racket chalane ke ilzaam main is hotel par chhapemari kii, to jismfaroshi ke dhandhebaazon ke benakaab hone ke saath-saath kai aisi kahaniyaan bhi saamne aa gayi, jiske bare main police ne sochaa nahin tha
 After all the investigation, the police filed a lawsuit against the couples under the Prevention of Immoral Trafficking Act, or the beaten sections, who had arrived here in the hotel room with the intention of committing prostitution
 lekin police ko aise ladke-ladkiyaan bhi mili, jo apane azeez ke saath hotel ke band kamare main sukun ke do pal guzaarana chaahate the
 The police allowed such people to get stuffed
 haalanki is maamle main hotel kaa ravaiya zarur benakaab ho gaya
 According to the police, in this hotel, such customers were given hourly rooms, which were priced between Rs 500 and Rs 2000
 is silsile main ai-card jaisi zaruri niyam-kaanoonon kii bhi andekhi kii ja rahi thi, balki jin jodon ke paas ai-card nahin hota tha, hotel ke mulaazim unhen bina pahchaan patr ke kamaron main entry dene ke liye doguni rakam vasula sakate the
 This is the reason that the police have also registered a case against the owner of the hotel and the accused under Pita
 vaise chaanbin ke dauraan police ko aisi ladkiyaan bhi kam nahin milin, jinka jismfaroshi ke dhandhe se dur-dur tak koi vaasta nahin he
 But she came to this hotel with the intention of spending time with her partner
 vaise ab is karrwai ke baad yah baat saafe ho gai he ki police kii jaankaree ke bagaiyr yah sabakuch police kii naak ke neeche katai mumkin nahin tha
 However, now that the people of the area are happy after this action, it has also become clear that how for some particular reasons, even the uniformed people deliberately ignore the breaking of the law
 dilli puure hindustan main jismfaroshi main aagedilli or ensiaar main jismfaroshi ke anginat aise adde hai, jinke bare main police ko dur-dur tak bhanak bhi nahin he
 According to a recent UNO report, Delhi is one of the largest bases of prostitution and human trafficking in India
 dilli kii andheri galiyon main vah redlite ilaaka he, jahaan kabhi ladakiyon ko shaadi ke naam par phusalaakar, kabhi naukari dilaane kaa jhansa dekar log is mandi main bech jate hai
 Then it is written in their fate that black truth, which makes them feel alive every day
 dilli ensiaar main ladakiyon kii kharid-farokht ke aankade vaaki main chaunkaane vaale hai, in aankadon main wo kaala sach kaid he, jinhen dekhakar or sunakar aapke pairon tale jameen khisak jaaegi

 PCB Chief Operating Officer Subhan Ahmed said that Shoaib Akhtar has retired, so we cannot say what he does
 hamane abhi tak na to kitaab dekhi or na padhi he, isliye ham nahin jaanate ki sachai kya he
 He said, but certainly some of the things he has said today are surprising
 lekin yah bhi sach he ki vah ab board se nahin judaa he or jo kuch karnaa chahta he, uske liye swatantra he
 But after playing for the country, we should behave rationally

 However, no party has been able to achieve the magic figure of forming a government in Madhya Pradesh, since the Congress is close to the 116 seats required for majority, then the role of independents, BSP and SP became important to form the government
 chunaav ayog ke anusaar empi main congress 114 siton par jeet chuki he, jabaki bijepi 109 siton par ataki hui he
 Apart from these two major parties of the state, the Samajwadi Party (SP) has got one seat

 However, Modi's proposal to contest from Lucknow has been put on its own and i will exert full power to win the PM candidate

 Vinod Kumar Tikku, 58, a member of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), when he raided the shelter home on 9 May, saw the reaction he saw there as "disgusting and shameful"
 '' tikku or phir baad main 5-6 june ko chandigarh ke vakil anil malhotra or sudipti sharma dwaara record kiye gaye bayaan or bhi zyada khaufnak the
 It is alleged that Jaswanti Devi and her companions were actually running a "panic house" just three km from Chief Minister Bhupendra Singh Hooda's house
 malhotra or sharma dwaara 12 june ko hycourt ko saunpi gai 28 pannon kii report main likhaa he, ''bacchon kaa shaareerik shoshan kiya jaataa tha, berahami se peeta jaataa tha, akasar unhen nanga rakhaa jaataa tha, sharaab pine ke liye majaboor karte the or unase niyamit taur par khetihar or nirmaan majdoor kii tarah kaam karavaaya jaataa tha

 kai peeditaaon ne to sthaneey guest house or hotalon main 'videshiyon' ke saath yon sambandhon kaa khulaasa kiya
 Now a young girl sent to Mother Teresa Charity Mission in Panipat said, "whenever the girls were sent out of the shelter home with Jai Bhagwan and Satish, Jaswanti used to say, the wheat has been cut
 '' usne yah bhi bataaya ki har tarah kii yon gatividhiyon or yahaan tak ki chote bacchon ke saath hone vaali har harakat ko camere main record kiya jaataa tha
 The NCPCR report released on June 30 says that at least four of the girls rescued from their homes have been found to be HIV positive
 shelter home main rahane vaali mahilaon se janm lene vaale bacchon ko gaiyrkanoonee dhang se bechaa jaataa tha
 The NCPCR estimates that in the last three years, about 41 people have gone missing from their home
 29 logon kaa ab bhi kuch pataa nahin he
 Unaware of the activities of the shelter home, the Haryana government honored Jaswanti with the Indira Gandhi Mahila Shakti Puraskar on 23 March
 use pramaan patr ke saath-saath ek lakh ru
 Award was also given
 lekin usase bhi zyada hairaani vaali baat yah he ki mahila evam bal vikaas mantri gita bhukkal ko in khaufnak baton kaa khulaasa hone ke baad bhi 11 june ko yah puraskaar waapas lene main ek maheenaa lag gaya
 On June 16, when presented in Rohtak District Court, Jaswanti boasted, "no one can spoil me

 ve aropiyon kaa mobile phone yaa unke computer yaa anya kisi recording divaais bhi hasil karne main safal nahin rahe
 Not only this, the Haryana administration has left no stone unturned to defy the instructions of NCPCR
 unhone 'apana ghar' se bachaae gaye 103 peediton ko haryana ke saat shaharon main 12 alag-alag shelter home main bhej diya

 bachapan main hi maan-baap ko kho diya or majaburi main boojadkhaane main mazdooree kii
 When the young son died, he spent the last time of his life in a deranged state
 par lekhan jaise unke liye sab kuch tha
 Matiani used to say that 'he does' farming' on paper
 ' or vaaki aisa tha bhi
 Shailesh Matiani is counted among the best narrators in the country
 unhone hindi sahitya ko chil, pyaas or pathar, ateet tathaa anya kahaniyaan, bheden or gaderiye, kanya tathaa anya kahaniyaan, barf or chattaane, ‘naach, jamoore, naach’, mamud, savitri jaise shreshth kahani sangrah die to gopuli gafooran, chand auraton kaa shahar, nagvallari, baawan nadiyon kaa sangam, maaya-sarovar, muthbhed, ramakali, hauldaar, uttarkand jaise upanyaas to die hi, lekhak kii haisiyat se, bela hui aber, trigya, mukhyadhara kaa sawaal, yada-kada, rashtrabhasha kaa sawaal jaise vichaaratmak tathaa lok aakhyaan se sambandhit utkrisht kritiyaan bhi deen
 Critic Giriraj Kishore evaluated his stories and described him as a novelist ahead of Premchand
 kabhi rajendra yadav ne bhi unki kahaniyon par tippanee karte hue kaha tha ki matiani hamaare bich vah akelaa lekhak he, jiske paas das se bhi adhik nayab or behtareen hi nahin, kaaljayi kahaniyaan hai, jabaki amuman lekhakon ke paas do yaa phir teen hua karti hai
 If someone is very talented, then the limit is five
 shailesh matiani ne na sirf hindi ke aanchalik sahitya ko nai oonchai di, balki hindi kahani ko kai yaadgaar charitra bhi die
 Read the literature on Aajtak on his death anniversary today, this classic story of 'maimood'
 yah kahani unke isi naam se prabhaat prakaashan dwaara prakashit kahani sangrah kaa hissaa he
 This is a unique story of its kind in Hindi literature, highlighting the human sentiment that made the goat a centerpiece in a Muslim family
 kahaneh mamud- shailesh matianimahmud phir jor baandhane laga, to jaddan ne daayan kaan anthte hue, uskaa munh apni ore ghuma liya
 She slapped on the right snout, "what a shave, very mullah dopiaja, shakes! Will give a thrill, all boil will come out
 na piddi na piddi ke shorwe, saale bahut saand bane ghoomte hai
 Amie Suleman's Amma, now what my mouth sees, bring me something
 tera kaam to ban hi gaya na? dekh lenaa, kaise shandaar pathiye detii he! iske to saare pathiye rang par bhi isi ke jate hai
 "while doing his thing, Jaddan left his ears and began to fold his neck
" ab mahmud bhi dhire se palata, or sir unchaa karke jaddan kaa kaan munh main bhar liya, to vah chilla padi, ‘‘ari o suleman kii ammi, dekh to saale is shaitan kii karatuut jaraa apni aankhon se! chugad kaan anthne kaa badla le rahaa he
 o Maimud, Sasale, do not put your teeth, otherwise you will not do well
 acha, le ai tu rotiyaan? ari, ye to rashan ke gehun kii nahin, desi kii dikhti hai
 La hither
 dekha tuune, haraami kaise meraa kaan munh main bhare tha? ab tuje yakeen nahin aayega, rahiman! ye saalaa to bilkul inasaanon kii tarah jajbaati he!’’‘‘jaanavar to goonga hota he, sharafat kii ammaa! alabatta insaan usamen jajbaton kaa aks jarur dhoondhata he
 You take so much care of this poor goat, what will the mother keep of her child
 ’’rahiman ne donon rotiyaan jaddan ko pakadaa di thim or bakra ab roti ke tukade chabane main vyast ho gaya tha
 When he swallowed a piece completely, he started thrusting the stubborn with his horns again
 ‘‘sabar naam kii cheez to khuda ne tuje kisi bhi baat main bakshi hi nahin
 Saying "jaddan then turned his mind to Rahiman," "when a man gets old, he needs someone who comes from his 'aa' and goes from saying 'jaa'
" duniyaavaalon kii duniya jane, suleman kii ammaa! meraa to ek yah naamuraad mamud hi he, jis saale ko is khuldabad kii nabiwali gali se aawaaj lagaaoon ki ‘mamud! mamud! mamud!’ to chugad nakhascone ke koodaykhane par pahunchaa hua peeche palatataa he or ‘bain-bain’ karata wo daud ke aata he meri taraf ki tu jaan, sagi aulad kya aegi! bas, saalaa jab kunbapraspi pe nikalataa he, to meri kya khuda kii bhi nahin sunegaa
 
 
 
 phir bhi aawaaj laga don, to ek baar palat ke jarur ‘bain’ kar legaa, bhale hi baad main apni ammaaon kii taraf dooni raftaar se daud pade
 
 
 
 ’’apni baat puri karke jaddan hans padi, to uske chhidare or katthi rang ke bhadde daanton main ek chamak-si dikhaai de gai
 Out of a shabby, twitchy, and battered burqa, the battered face of old age remains unraveled, so the appearance of witches comes out
 ‘‘jab is kasaayiyon ke niwale kaa kissa bakhaanne lagati ho tum, sharafat kii ammaa, mirganjwaliyon kii-si chamak aa jaati he tum main!’’ apni kaaphi dur nikal chuki bakrii ko ek najar toh lene ke baad, rahiman ne majaak kiya or khud bhi hans padi
 "who are you now young, Rahiman?" After all, you are an experienced woman! ”you know, one of these lifeless animals and the other innocent child - these are two, who do not go to the age of man, his body and his beauty, but only good-natured and hate-love
 Let's recognize
 hamaare sharafat kii banno to tumhaari hajaar baar kii dekhi hui he, khubsuurati or nur main uske mukaable kii haji lalamuhammad bidiwaalon yaa sherwaniyon ke hiyaan bhi mushkil se milegi, rahiman!
 
 
 But you know that my mammoth turns its head backward on seeing his face
 badgumaan kaiti he, ‘naakaabile bardaasht bu martha he’ or ye ki ‘ammaa, hamaare bacchon ko chhod dengi, lekin ye bakra nahin chhutegaa
 '
 
 
 main kaiti hoon, teri kamasini or khubsuurati pe laanat he
 Sprinkle a million pods and perfumes, you will not spit out my mamud on your word
 
 
 
 Animals and children are not human skinned, they look fixed, fixed! It is a miracle that a gasp from the hands of the Nawabzadi goes towards my mouth
 God bless you, Rahiman! See, at first there are three, not two plates, have you gone somewhere! 
 
 khuda kasam, ye rotiyaan tuune is naamuraad ke nahin, mere pet main daal di hai
 
 
 
 muhallewaale to, bas, sarkari maveshi samajhakar chale aate hai
 It is not with the commissioners that two rotis or a handful of grains should be brought together
 are bhai, mamud jo dhoop main khel ke waapas aanevaale maasoom bacchon kii tare murjhaa jaataa he, ye to sirf jaddan ko hi dikhaai detaa he yaa uuparavaale khuda ko
 Thou darling, was born around Bakrid last year
 ab yaaddaasht kamjor pad chuki, lekin shaayad, ye hi jumme yaa jumeraat ke roj paidaa hua hoga or ab saal upar saadhe teen maheene kaa ho liya
 "jaddan stood up from Khatole, flailing his hand on Mahmud's back," Well, Suleman's Amma will go
 sharafat ke abba kii duper kii namaaj kaa vakt ho rahaa he
 It is heard that the father of Shahnaz is also coming from Rae Bareli
 
 
 ’’ tabhi rahiman ne kaha ki ‘‘tum sava-dedh saal kaa bataati ho, magar iske raan-putthe dekh ke koi teen se neeche kaa nahin kootegaa
 twenty-five serous meat will be released in this goat
 lagata he, tumne roti-dane ke alaava ghaas se parvarish kii hi nahin?’’haalaanki rahiman ne sari baaten mahmud kii prashansa main kahin thim, lekin jaddan kaa puraa cheharaa tyoriyon kii tarah chadh gaya, ‘‘ari o rahiman, aag lage tere muun main
 Means you have gone out, so i sat down to weigh my mamud meat? Your Khabind is a carpenter, where are these things learned from the families of the villagers? Or the name of God, Haya and Rahm did not exist in humans! There is no difference between the sight of meatmen and the butcher's knife
 ari rahiman, kahe detii hoon- aage se aisi behudee baaten naa karnaa or ainde se apni bakrii kahin duusari jage le janaa
 Some Susra is sitting in Khuldabad with only one of my mamud
 
 
 
 "" Ari Jaddan, now do not show much attitude to the big families of Begums! Susra did not goat, Hatimatai became for you
 ’’ rahiman ne bhi jhidak diya or vyangy bhari aawaaj main boli, ‘‘wo jo ek muhaavara he, tumne bhi to suna hoga -bakre kii ammaa aakhir kab tak duaen karegi? or, jaddan, sunaanevaale ko sunanaa bhi siikhnaa hi chahie
 If you ask us, the reality is that you have no child
 sautelon ko na tumne kaleje ke kareeb aane diya, or na un naamuraadon se tumhaare seene main doodh utaara gaya
 This is the reason why you call this bearded goat 'my mamud, my mamud!' You extinguish your jealousy by calling
 
 
 
 "the stubbornness continued, stopping as if the scorpion had bitten
" uskaa cheharaa gusse main tamtamaane ke baad, laachaargi se syah pad gaya, ‘‘rahiman, jo ji tuune meraa dukhaaya he, khuda tuje samajhegaa
 And the phrase of 'goat ki amma' is gone, so where does the blessing of Amma of human being last for a very long time? If you used to do, then your elder son Suleman would have been young today and you would not have left the name 'suleman Ki Amma' only! Silence a moment, Rahiman! God forgive me, i did not want to make fun of the past on you - i just want to be so much, the pain of the person is the feelings
 jisase jajbaati rishta na ho, uskaa kaahe kaa syapa?
 
 
 Suleman's Amma, i also know that the goat has to bite
 kasaayiyon se koun sa bakra bachaa aaj talak?
 
 
 But i definitely have such a sense of belonging to me - do not be cut off in front of my eyes
 
 
 
 i have gone to the Abba of Sharafat, when you start selling this Namurad, first of all you must keep the distance of the city at least
 
 
 
 And of course i agree with you that Amma's devotion to the goat is in the ears of the deaf
 yah bhi thik he, sautelon ne mujhe sagi ammaa kii-si izzat nahin bakshi, yah kaina saraasar jhooth bol ke dojakh main janaa hoga
 
 
 But the love that this animal gave me, amma-abba may have given, then it must have given
 ’’rahiman se koi uttar ban nahin paaya
 She just kept seeing that Jaddan wiped her eyes with Burke's pallu and proceeded towards her house, patting the goat's back
 jaddan jab tak ghar pahaunchi, ashraf namaaj par baith chuke the
 Closing the goat in the narrow closet next to Pakhane, Jaddan said, "abba of Sharafat sat on the prayer of Dupre
" ab tu kahan maaraa-maaraa phiregaa
 Will take it out in the evening
 is saal to abhi se lu chalane lagi
 "when you sat down to eat, Ashraf said," Sharafat's mother, the message of the Rae Bareliwals had come, you will know
 ham log to tangadasti main chal rahe hai, magar mehmaanon ke saamne to apana ronaa royaa nahin jaataa
 Have to see respect
 sharafat or jahir se baat hui thi
 The boys were rightly saying that 'abba, there is a price of ten rupees kg in the market
 paanch-chhi jane shahanaz kii pihar se rahenge or bhale-bure main das-paanch apni aapasadaari ke logon ko bulaanaa jaruri sa hota he
 If you eat others' feast, you will have to keep your shame
 ’ sharafat to yahi kahata tha ki ‘ammaa se puch ke dekh len
 'had your goat been chopped, the household item would have come in handy at home
 bazaar main to chalis-pachaas se kam kii thukegi nahin
 Empty Roganjosh boils will not work
 kebab or kofte badi bahut achche banaati he
 Last year, when we had gone to Rae Bareli, Shebaz's father had cut two goats and who should count the chickens
 chaar-paanch din kul jamaa rahe honge, gosht kha-khaakar afara ho gaya
 Poor people, we are definitely against them, but do not necessarily give proof of their commitment
 ’’ashraf bhoomika bandhate ja rahe the or jaddan kaa cheharaa khinchataa ja rahaa tha
 Everyone at home knew that it would not be so easy to remove the goat from Amma
 ashraf jab baaten kar rahe the, shahanaz chupake-chupake apane bachche ko pilav khilaa rahi thi or saham rahi thi ki kahin ammaa aasmaan kii tarah na fat paden
 The mouth was on the other side of it, but the ears were on the stern side
 jyonhi jaddan ne dhimi lekin kadavi aawaaj main kaha ki ‘‘sharafat kii laila to mere mamud kii jaan ko aa gai he
 
 
 
 ’’ shahanaz dabe swar main boli, ‘‘ammaa, ye tohamat hamen naa dijie
 They are sitting in front, ask, we have been continuously saying that Amma is very passionate, no one can tease her
 
 
 
 This will be done and the anger of Amma will fall on the innocent, instead of her sons
 ’’shahanaz ke kehane main kuch aisi vinamrata or sammaan kii bhaavana thi ki jaddan kaa rukh badal gaya, ‘‘sharafat ke abba, bakre ko maine koi chaati pe band ke thode le janaa he! rahiman thik hi to kaiti thi ki ‘jaddan aapa, bakre kii maan kahan tak khayr manaa sakati he!’
 
 
 My only wish is that the things of this little named animal getting up and sitting and laughing have also become a part of my memory
 chota memna tha, tab tum logon ne hi khud dekha or hajaar baar tokaa he ki ammaa bakre ko aulad kii tarah saath sulaati he
 What would she do, the winter used to be so much and without a mother, she was a child! 
 
 khayr, meri to itani-si salaah he ki mehmaan aaen to unki izzat hamaari izzat he
 Tell Zaheer, somewhere, the villagers on the side of katre-kandalganj would sell their hands and bring the meat from its money, or buy another goat
 iskaa to gosht bhi bu maaregaa
 And, God knows, i have made myself like a girl now that this haramjade has to be cut
 main hi ullu kii patthee thi, jo isko khuraaq dekar goshtkhoron ke liye motaa karti rahi
 "though all things were said by Jaddan in a very cold voice and with indifference, everyone knew that anger would be running like blood in his body at this time
 apni hataasha or udaseenta ko kamare main patjhar ke patton kii tarah giraati hui si jaddan uth khadi hui to shahanaz boli, ‘‘bakre kaa gosht bu degaa, yah kehane ke peeche ammaa kaa khaas makasad he
 You will tell these people not to insist on Amma
 ’’ashraf miyaan ne ek lambii saans lee or bole, ‘‘isko dekhtaa hoon, to beete hue din yaad aane lagate hai
 Sharafat and Zaheer had gone big when they were small
 isane ham logon ko kabhi is baat kaa ahsaas hi nahin hone diya ki buudhe kii bibi mar gai he yaa bacchon kii ammaa! tum log to ab dekh rahi ho, ab na isamen aab rahi, na taab! bakra cat hi jaae, to acha he
 They flock to the sun like crazy
 vah susraa kabhi ek thikaane to rahata nahin
 If cut, it will make me cry for a few more days! Everyday problems will be overcome
 dekhnaa mehmaanon ke saamne ammaa yon talle laga burka pahane na chali aaen! vakt kii maar bhi kya maar he! dekhati ho, adhkhaya karke uth gayi
 When you were of age, then the varieties of basmati were seen to be fine-grained basmati for zarda casserole
 ab yah rashan ke chawlon ko pilaa karnaa to haldi kii beijjati karnaa he
 "at the same time, when the elder son Zaheer arrived, he was told the whole situation
" vah laaparvaahee ke saath bolaa, ‘‘aap log bekaar main baat badaye jate hai
 i will explain Amma
 ab yah koi unki bakre ke peeche daudane kii umr he? sadak par bhaagti dikhti hai, to sharamshaar hoke rah jate hai ham log
 Hungry, thirsty and ravenous will go, believe me, then call Salim the butcher and put the mince on the ground, remove the skin before the guests arrive
 raane pilav main dalava dijie or is vakt ke meet main seenaa-chaap-gardan kii botiyaan thik rahengi
 For the sake of household things, two-and-a-half hundred will not be available from the market
 jubaid kii ammaa bhi yahi kahati thim ki sola rupye wo dengi, tees-battis rupye, shaayad, ye shahanaz bhi denevaali thim ki ‘ammaa apane beton ko to baksh dengi, hamen nahin
 'now who should explain to these idiots that while doing two kilos of grass and oil and spices, one hundred rupees will be removed
 rashan kaa chaaval to mehmaanon ke liye pilav main istemaal hoga nahin or dhang kii basmati saadhe chaar-paanch se kamati kaa ser nahin
 Human beings should go after their time and comfort, the days of walking on emotions are over
 ’’‘‘kehete thik ho, bete! meri bhi raay yahi he
 Just meet Amma and explain it to you
 ziddee jarur he, lekin naasamajh nahin
 Saying "ashraf Mian stood up, then the sound of his knees was heard clearly
" jahir kii gharwaali yah kehete hue uth khadi hui ki ‘‘tum log shuru karo, main jaraa abba hujur ke haath dhulawa don
 "having finished eating, Zaheer went straight into the inner room that Amma would be asleep, but Shahnaz told," Thus she has left saying that Zara will go to Rizvi Sahab's house
 unke ghar pichley hafte gami ho gai thi
 Has gone saying that maybe it is evening, she will come back late
 meraa khyal he, ammaa ne samaj liya he ki ab bakra bachataa nahin, gami main shariq hona to ek bahaanaa he
 She would like to stay away from home
 ’’shahanaz dhime-se hansnaa chaahati thi, lekin sirf udhaas hokar rah gai
 Zaheer went out and said to his eleven-twelve-year-old boy, "zubaid, call Zara Salim and bring Laiyo
" mehmaanon ke aane tak main safai ho jaae, to hi thik he
 Amma of Zubaid, brother, you just make the outside room well for the guests
 shahanaz ke abba logon ko kisi tarah kii kami kii shikaayat na ho
 Poor people come on every crop and take care of everything
 khud tumhaare saath apni sagi beti se zyada muhabbat kaa bartaav karte hai
 Prepare the two onions and spices without grinding them
 baaki bazaar kaa saamaan sharafat letaa aayega
 When Salim arrives, tell him, Do not leave the dirt in the courtyard
 poncha lagava lenaa
 Amma will worsen if you see blood stains etc
 tum logon se kuch kehane lagen, to kah dena, jubaid ke abba ne jabardastee katwa diya
 i will explain them
 ’’shaam kii jagah ghadi bhar raat biit chukne ke ahsaas ke baad hi, jaddan waapas lauti or gali main se hote hue, ghar ke pechhevaale sankare aangan main nikal gai
 Khatola dropped and lay down on it and closed his eyes in an attempt to hide himself in the nearby neem darkness
 mehmaan aa chuke the or unke tathaa aapas ke logon kii baatcheet yahan pichhawaade bhi sunai de rahi thi
 When she brought the young children out, Shahnaz saw it and came closer, pressing her feet, "abba has come
" aate hi aapaki babat puch rahe the ki ammaa ne puchhawaya he, kisi hai
 Sometimes she is getting it to come towards Rae Bareli
 maine bhi abba se kaha ki ab kii baar main ammaa ke saath hi aauungi
 Amma, where will you eat food? The guest house will sit in the outside sitting there
 jaldi kha-pi lene kii baaten kar rahe the sabhi log
 a religious type film is set somewhere in the city! "" Send me two loaves here
 or yaad rakho, gosht-vosht yaa kebab-pilav kuch naa bhijwaana
 My life is neither good nor stomach
 jubaid ko jaraa bhej dena, main usase kuch mangava loongi
 You all eat and drink comfortably
 meri phikr naa karnaa
 There is no cold now
 main yaheen so jaaongi
 My salute from my father, my father, cana and cana that morning will be dua-salaam, Amma is not right now
 ’’shahanaz ne anubhav kiya ki jaddan kii aawaaj marate vakt kii-si ho ai he
 Very light and lifeless
 vah chaahati thi ki kuch baaten karke, uski udaseenta ko kam karne kii koshish kare, lekin is dar se chup rah gai ki kahin andar ikattha kiya hua dukh gusse kii shakl main baahar foot aayaa to puure ghar kaa vaataavaran badal jayega
 It is good to let today's time go away like this
 waapas lautakar usne bataaya, to jahir or ashraf miyaan, donon ne munh bira liya
 “we have tried every moment that Amma could not see anything from that nominal goat from anywhere
 wo to itani sanjeeda ho gai hai, jaise bakre kaa halaal kiya hua sar aangan main tangaa hua ho
 She was saying, do not send any meat or casserole
 ’’ shahanaz ne kaha, to ashraf miyaan uth khadey hue
 He said, "when we have to feed him, call us
 kyon, bhai jubaid, tum kahan tasharif le ja rahe ho? jaraa baithak main mehmaanon ke kareeb raho
 "" Chachaji had sent backyard to Badi Amma
 unhone chaar aane hamen die hai ki jaao, shanbhu pandat kii duukaan se aalu kii sabji le aao
 '' 'abe, here la Chavanni
 ja, mehmaanon ko pani-vaani poochna
 We will see Amma
 shahanaz bete, aisa karo, ek thali main pilav or bade katore main gosht lagaakar hamen de do
 We will explain it by taking it
 vaaki, bahut bevakoof kism kii aurat he
 Zaheer, you sit outside and start laying the basement
 sharafat ke alaava or ek-do ladakon ko saath le lo
 Shehnaaz delivered the plate of casserole and bowl of meat
 khatole kii bagal main rakhkar, pani laane ke bahaane turant laut ai
 Ashraf Mian touched his forehead and said, "why, brother, why are you lying down like this?" Is your health okay? Listen, do not put mud on everything done
 tum rusavaa rahogi to sari mehmaannawaaji feeki pad jaaegi
 The whole house blows kababs and meat and you get the watery potatoes from that shambhu pandat, it is our job to kill our shoes
 
 
 
 What has happened that you caught a bed? You have never avoided meat
 bina shorwe ke roti gale ke neeche tumhaare utarati nahin
 Now there is no use of being emotional to this extent
 aakhir jin bakron kaa gosht tum aaj tak khaati ai ho, unke koi chaar sing to the nahin!
 
 
 Here, Shahnaz has given food
 gosht vaaki bahut lajjatdaar bana he
 Zaheer went to find another goat as well, but came back and said, 'abba, if you go to sell you, you will give fifty to a hundred and if you go to buy others, you will ask for fifty
 ’ tum to ghar kii is vakt jo andruni haalat he, jaanati hi ho
 
 
 
 ’’jaddan aise uthi, jaise kabristaan main gada hua murda khadaa ho rahaa ho
 With sharp eyes, he looked towards Ashraf Mian and the voice did not reach the guests, thus pressing and said, "zaheer's father, have you come to give advice?" Will you understand my problem? i have been spending hours here in Rizvi, so how did it come to my mind that now how you will be separating the head of my maimud from the torso - how you will be pulling his skin - how to cook his meat - jar - jar i have been crying and by understanding Rizvi's wife, i am being told that i am crying on the death of her ill-fated brother
 aaj sasura sabere-sabere se baar-baar kaan munh main bhare jaataa tha or main thoothna pakadakar, dhakka de detii thi
 What should i know that Badnasib secretly wants to say in his ear that 'amma, we will go today
 
 
 !’ tum log samajhoge meri takalif ki kaise mere labon par ‘mamud’ kii sadaa yaad aegi or khatm ho jaaegi?’’jaddan kaaphi der tak foot-footkar roti rahi
 Ashraf Mian remained seething
 unki samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki sthiti ab sanbhale kaise! aakhir unhone yahi tay kiya ki chupchaap khaanaa uthaa le janaa hi thik rahegaa
 He lifted the plate and bowl, and said in a loud poisoned voice, "you are not troubled by the pain that i am a top-class woman when i am asking, 'son Shahnaz, don't give us meat!' What would be the reason? And Zaheer's father, a man does not become a pir by growing his beard
 tum ye mujhe kya naseehat doge ki sabhi bakron ke do sing hote hai! itnaa to nadida bhi jaanata he
 In the world, even humans have made two hands and two toes like two horned goats? But a woman is addicted only when her own soul dies! Amma coddles her chest only when her own child is parted! 
 
 ye main bhi jaanati hoon ki mere mamud main koi surkhaab ke par nahin lage the, magar itnaa main jaanati hoon ki meri takalif jitani vah badanaseeb samajhataa tha, na tum samajhoge, na tumhaare bete
 
 
 ! If you understood, did any Hakim tell that feeding the meat of this goat to the guests and barking you too, otherwise it will be a cold? Abba of Zaheer, you do not fall for the principles, but do not plead with us at this time
 shahanaz se kaho, uthaa le jaae, nahin to phenk duungi udhar! jubaid se kah dena, ab pandat ke hiyaan se sabji laane kii bhi koi jarurat naa rahi
 My stomach is filled with your advice
 ’’ashraf miyaan neeche jhuke or thali-katoraa uthaate hue, waapas aa gaye, ‘‘lo bete, rakho! ziddee aurat ko samajhaana to khuda ke bas kaa bhi nahin
 Care for the guests, leaving him in his condition

 Yes, the new government rules will come into effect from November next year according to which all those passports which cannot be scanned by machines will become invalid
 darasal international civil aviation orgenigeshan ne aisi guideline jari kii he or yah 24 november, 2015 tak lagu hone hai
 Under this, passports that are handwritten or valid for only six months or have pasted photographs or which do not have enough pages for the visa will become invalid
 aise passport par vija bhi nahin mil sakegaa
 No country will prevent such passport holders from coming here
 iske maddenjar bharat main videsh mantralay ne 23 disambar ko ek salaah jari kii he
 Now passports issued for a period of 20 years in the 90s will also become invalid
 us samay ke passport mashiinon se padhe nahin ja sakate
 The number of such passports in the country is understood to be 2 by the end of November
 86 lakh he
 The total number of passport holders in India is 60 million
 bharat sarkaar ne un logon ko, jo videsh main rah rahe hai aagaah kiya he ki ve apane passporte kaa naveekaran kara len nahin to ye amaanya ho jaaenge
 The government has also said that people whose passport validity is going to expire in less than six months should also get their passports renewed because many countries do not grant visas on such passports
 jo passport dharak videsh yatra bahut karte hai, unhen atirikt pannon kii jarurat padati he
 Many countries do not grant visas on such additional pages
 bharat sarkaar ne unase aagrah kiya he ki ve bhi apane passport ko rineau karvaa len
 One big advantage of creating new passports is that they will be difficult to counterfeit
 yani aapke passport ko hathiyaakar koi uskaa durupyog nahin kar paaegaa

 deshbhar main daliton par ho rahe atyaachaar or upi kii haal kii ghatana ko lekar mayawati ne aaj bijepi par tikhaa hamalaa bolaa
 Mayawati said that the recent events have exposed the anti-dalit face of the BJP
 mayawati ne kaha ki piem daliton par ho rahe atyaacharon ke maamle main chuppi saadhe hue hai

 Amid growing concern about nuclear weapons being handed over to terrorists, the Taliban have said that there is no plan to attack Pakistan's nuclear installations, as it is the only Muslim nation which has such weapons
 osama bin laden kii maut kaa badla lene ke liye taliban ne pakistan main hinsaatmak abhiyaan tej kar diya he or is tarah kii ashankaayen balwati ho gai hai ki desh kaa parmaanu hathiyaar aasaan lakshya ban saktaa he
 The Wall Street Journal reported that Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan said that Pakistan was the only nuclear weapon state and the group had no intention of altering this fact
 akhbaar ne kaha ki baharhaal taliban kaa iraadaa pakistan or iske hathiyaaron par kabja karne kaa he
 It is not easy to tie the borders of the north-east, through the forests and rivers, infiltration occurs more than Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar
 uttar purv ke ilaakon main jangalon, pahaado, nadiyon ke jaal or kathin ghaatiyon kaa phayda uthaakar yah ghuspaith desh main hoti he
 These things were said by India Today Conclave East, former Army Chief General Bikram Singh, Lt General Shaukeen Chauhan and Additional Secretary of Road Transport Ministry Shambhu Singh held in Kolkata
 general bikram singh ne kaha ki uttar purv main kuch jagahon par simaaen aisi hai jahaan par simaaon ko baandhna aasaan nahin he
 Fencing is not possible
 checkpost bananaa mushkil he
 In spite of this we have imposed many restrictions
 lekin sabase zyada ghuspaith bangladesh or myanmar se hi hoti he
 General Bikram Singh said that i remember that in 2012, 82 battalions of BSF were stationed on these borders
 is puri seemaa par 1008 seemaa post hai
 But fencing was not easy
 aap kabhi bhi itane bhayanak halaat vaali simaaon par puri suraksha vyavastha nahin kar sakate
 Can not completely stop the intrusion
 nadiyon main kaise banaaenge baad, jahaan kuch bhi bahaav main nahin tiktah shambhusadak parivahan mantralay ke adishnal secretary shambhu singh ne kaha ki bangladesh ke saath kareeb 4300 kilometre kii seemaa he
 About 1300 kilometers are in the rivers
 nadiyon kaa bahaav bahut tej he
 It is impossible to put anything here
 naga hills se bhi ghuspaith hoti he lekin ye behad kam he
 But when you see the infiltration from Bangladesh, you will find that there are infiltration from more than a dozen places
 vah bhi nadiyon ke jariye
 That too from very dangerous areas
 in nadiyon, jangalon or mangruves se hone vaale ghuspaith ko roak paanaa behad mushkil hota he
 Work is found in India, so people do infiltration: People come to America for job from General Vikram singhmexico
 usee tarah dekhen to bharat main naukari he
 Work
 yah bangladesh main nahin he
 That's why people run towards India
 agar logon ko anumati den ki aap subah aao or shaam ko waapas jaao to shaayad kuch samasya kaa samaadhaan ho
 The second big reason for this is global warming
 badhate taapmaana kii vajah se bhi log pareshaan he
 When you look at the big picture, it shows that there is a need for very vigilant soldiers on such borders
 aapako technology badhaani hogi
 State-of-the-art boundaries have to be built
 People from the same family and community live across borders: Shaukeen Chauhanle
 general shaukeen chouhan ne kaha ki seemaa post kii baat karte hai to agar 10-15 log post ko chhodkar ek-do kilometre kii seemaa kii nigaraanee karne jaaenge to post khatre main aa jaaegi
 The Myanmar border receives seven months of rain
 aap ek meter ke aage dekh nahin sakate
 How to leave a post like this? Because people from the same community live on both sides
 ye aapasi sambandh rakhte hai
 They belong to the same family
 ye kabhi pasand nahin karenge aap inke pariwaron ko alag kar de
 Take general chouhan ne kaha ki koi bhi vyakti 16 kilometre chalakar bhayaavah raaston se hote hue parivaar se milane nahin jayega
 They demand that if the people of our community remain together then we will stop the protest and infiltration
 seemaa ke donon taraf rahane vaale ek samudaay ke logon ko ek idi card de do
 So that they can be known
 ho saktaa he ki aise ycard dene hamaari samasya kaa samaadhaan us samudaay ke log hi kar den
 Chief of Defense will strengthen the country, forces will be one: Bikram Singh General Bikram Singh said that i would congratulate the government that he made the post of Chief of Defense

 This is an excellent position for the leadership and alliances of the three armies
 hamaare sidies ke paas adhikaar hai

 The film, released on Friday, stars Vidya Balan in the lead role
 film ke relies se pehle ali is baat ko lekar pareshaan the ki apni agali film 'khamoshiyaan' kii shooting kii vyastata ke kaaran vah 'bobi jasoos' ke pramotion main shaamil nahin ho paae
 Ali was shocked to learn that his absence in the promotion of 'bobby Detective' was seen as a mutual problem
 ali ne kaha, 'bobi jasoos' ke prachaar main meraa shaamil nahin ho paanaa dukhad rahaa, kyonki diya mirza or sahil saangha bahut achche insaan hai or doosraa isliye ki 'bobi jasoos' mere liye ab tak kaa bada brake he
 Ali said, 'I knew well that actress like Vidya Balan is in the lead role in the film

 ' There are reports of his predicament with Irrfan Khan regarding Vasu Bhagnani's Welcome to Karachi, but Irrfan says that he has parted ways with the film of his own accord
 isaki vajah produsar ke saath unke creative matbhed hai
 a source close to Irrfan has said that the producer had already been told that Irrfan was not going to be a part of the film
 irfan ne is bare main bataaya, 'main is tarah kii baat kisi produsar ko lekar kyon karuunga
 i have been associated with Welcome to Karachi from the scripting stage for almost one and a half years
 jab vasuji bataur produsar is project se jude to ve ise turant shuru karne chaahate the
 But i felt that we are not ready yet
 maine suzav diya ki pehle hamen chizon ko plan karnaa chahie or hamen uske liye behtareen actor chahie
 Which can bring the tone of Karachi
 mujhe laga ki ham clymex ko lekar bhi taiyaar nahin hai
 But he was in a hurry to shoot
 've aage bataate hai, 'produsar ne unase kaha, aap film karo yaa na karo mujhe fark nahin padataa
 It was this thing that forced me to withdraw from the project, i later agreed to do a cameo in the film
 shoot ke liye mila paisa bhi maine waapas kar diya

 The officials took stock of the security
 tilak samaaroh main aise ucch-stareey intjaam kiye gaye hai, jo aaj tak saifai ke kisi program main nahin hue hai
 Saifai's pandal is decorated with German Langer's tents at the behest of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 tej pratap singh kii shaadi argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav kii sabase choti beti rajalakshmi ke saath 26 may ko dilli main hogi

 Mulayam Singh will call the top politicians of the country on the land of his village in the royal tilak ceremony of his grandson and realize that even today, Mulayam has power
 aisi kahaniyaan filmon main to bahut ain
 But it seems strange to think that this will happen in today's era on the ground of reality
 ek badnaam gunda netaaon kii netagiri chamakaate-chamakate khud netaa ban jaataa he
 When power comes in hand, the law starts kicking
 jurm kii dictionari main jitne jurm hai wo sab karata he
 The policemen are not afraid but instead threaten them
 jaanate hai kiyon? kyonki is chote sarkaar ke sir par bade sarkaar kaa haath he
 Yes, JDU leader Anant Singh 'ji' is being talked about
 police prashasan main bhi unka khauf aisa he ki giraftaar ke baavjood bihar police ke aalaa afasar unke naam ke aage 'ji' lagaakar baat karte hai
 Yes yes anant singh ji
 When Sayan Kotwal is there and the Chief Minister of the state is his elder Sarkar
 to bhaiya to chote sarkaar honge hi
 Bihar is a strange misfortune
 jis bihar klypradhi mukt banane kaa sapanadikha kar mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bihar kii gaddi ke maalik bane, usee bihar main unke chota sarkaar hone kaa khitaab bihar ke sabase badtareen mujrim ko hasil hua
 Four women were molested by Mamlaimandar and Sharif Nitish Kumar's party jdu's Mokama MLA Anant Singh's family at Flood Bazaar
 khabar anant singh tak pahunchi
 Then what was there
 patna ke unke vidhayak awaas se gundon se bhari ek gaadi nikali
 All four boys were picked up from the market
 chaaron ke naam maut kii supaari nikal chuki thi
 But then Patna Police get a clue of it
 police kii special team anant singh ke gaanv pahunchati he
 Three of the four boys were badly beaten by then, they were yet to die
 magar ain vakt par police unhen bachaa leti he or anant singh ke paanch gundon ko daboch leti he
 But the fourth boy is not available
 agle din anant singh ke gaanv se hi uski laash milti he
 According to eyewitnesses, both his eyes were torn
 guptang kuchal die gaye the or lathi se tab tak peeta gaya jab tak ki wo mar nahi gaya
 After this, his body was thrown into the field
 esaspi ne dikhaaya maddnant singh ko jaanane vaale jaanate hai ki apane dushmano ko wo kaise thikaane lagaataa he
 But 'anant Singh ji' is an MLA of the government and above all a small government
 kanoon ke k se bhi kabhi nahin darate
 The police knew everything but who put hands on 'anant Singh ji'? So time passes in this misdeed
 lagane lagata he ki is baar bhi kanoon 'anant singh ji' kii choukhat par aane se pehle se dam tod degaa
 But then Jitendra Rana, the young SSP of Patna, shows the courage to fight the system
 paanch ladakon kii giraftaar ke baad unka bayaan liya jaataa he
 It gives a written statement that the order to raise four boys in the flood market and teach them a lesson was given by none other than MLA 'anant Singh Ji'
 magar anant singh ke khilaaf is bayaan kii khabar aalaa police afasaron or satta par kabiz logon ko lag jaati he
 Hence, the order for transfer of SSP arrives at 10 o'clock on the night of 22 June
 or yaheen se shuru hota he system ke khilaaf patna ke do esaspi kii jang
 One SSP going from Patna and the other SSP coming to Patna
 darasal anant singh ko pehali baar kanoon kii aukaat dikhanemen patna ke do esaspi kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 One Jitendra Rana who made him realize the strength of his uniform even after his transfer, and another Vikas Vaibhav who came back from NIA to Patna to clear his strength and intention on the very first day itself
 tabadale se pehle kar di press conferencejitendra rana ke tabadale kii file par 22 taarikh kii raat jab nitish kumaar ne dastakhat kiya tha tab unhen ye katai ahsaas nahin rahaa hoga unke naak ke neeche police mahakme main chal rahi raajnneeti unkirajnneeti ko hilaa kar rakh degi
 The order for transfer of SSP Jitendra Rana comes at 10 pm on 22 June and by the afternoon of 23 June, he is asked to hand over his charge to the new SSP Vikas Vaibhav
 jitendra rana chaahate to khamoshi ke saath patna esaspi kii kusi chhod kar nai posting par chale jate
 But he took a step which brought a storm in Bihar Police and Bihar politics
 tabadale kaa aadesh milane ke baavjood kursi chhodane se pehle unhone 23 june ko dopaher ek baje apana aakhri press conference bulaayaa or 'anant singh ji' kii sari karatuut ujagar kar di
 Jitendra Rana's stakes were such that it was difficult to save Anant Singh even for the SSP or Bihar Police top officers sitting on his chair after that
 ek esaspi ne jate-jate anant singh kii giraftaar warrant par apni muhar laga di thi or us warrant kii taamil nae esaspi ke jimme chhod di thi
 The new SSP said Dhawabihar had good luck
 jitendra rana kii jagah charge lene vale nae esaspi vikaas vaibhav bhi josh se bhare the
 He undertook to complete the unfinished work of Jitendra Rana
 shuruaati saboot thos the lihaaja charge lete hi unhone chupchaap adaalat se anant singh ke ghar kii talaashi lene ke liye search warrant hasil kar liya
 And then on the afternoon of 24 June, the force gathered from different districts of Patna and attacked the house of Anant Singh, where no one dared to go
 chaar ghante se upar talaashi chali
 During the search, we found those things from the house that just by evening all the henchmen of Anant Singh broke
 saboot kaaphi ikattha ho chuke the
 Now it was just the turn of the curtain
 shaam hote-hote pardaa bhi gira or anant singh ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 He was then presented before the magistrate on the night itself
 jahaan se unhen 14 dinon ke liye nyaayik hiraasat main usee beur jail bhej diya gaya jahaan wo pehle bhi rah chuke hai
 In 2004, the STF raided the house of Anant, in 2004, the STF raided the house of Anant Singh and then there was an hour of firing
 goli anant singh ko bhi lagi thi
 But he survived
 haalanki is encounter main anant singh ke aath log maare gaye
 After this, Anant Singh imprisoned himself in this fort-like house here
 yahaan aate hi anant singh ne pehla kaam ye kiya ki is makaan main kul 50 pariwaron ko kiraye par rakh liya
 Do you know why? So that once the police or STF attacks them, then this family will work for them
 aise paravaan chadha kariyarye ab ek nazar daalen chote sarkaar ke naam se jane jane vaale anant singh ke jurm ke kariyar par
 There is hardly any section left in the book of law under which a case in the name of Anant Singh is not filed
 anant singh par dhai darjan se adhik sangeen maamle darj hai
 These include various serious cases like murder, kidnapping, extortion, robbery and rape
 akele sirf baadh thane main hi kul 23 sangeen maamle darj hai
 It is a matter of fact that Anant Singh is acquitted in many of these cases with his influence
 anant singh ne jurm kii duniya ke saath saath siyaasi galiyaaron main bhi apni paith badhaai or nitish kumaar ke najadik aa gaya
 Nitish's friendship with Anant was very good and in November 2005 he won the election from Mokama on a JDU ticket
 jain samudaay is baat se acroshit he ki rajasthan hoicourt ne haal hi main 'santhara' par roak laga di he
 Santhara is the custom in Jainism, in which any person abandons food and water at his will and adopts death
 iske peeche dharna he ki agar koi apni ichha se santhara letaa he to vah moksh ko praapt karata he, lekin rajasthan hai court ne ise aatmahatya bataaya or kaha ki yahg dhara 309 ke tahat dandaneey aparaadh he
 The Rajasthan High Court has banned Santhara, for which the Jain community has protested in different places
 aaj jaipur main virodh pradarshan main shaamil hue jaipur ke jane-maane vyavsaayee ajay kaala ne kaha, ye ham rhite tu daai ki baat nahin kar rahe hai
 It is the birthright of every Jaini how he decides his life while playing religion
 is par roak lagaana dharm se khilwaad he
 Navita Jain, who joined the protest, said, "we do not agree that the court termed it a suicide
" aatmahatya to aap hataash hokar karte hai or parivaaravaalon ko nahin bataate
 In Santhara, you take permission first, only then you take Santhara in the guidance of Guru or Muni
 santhara par yachika 2006 main daayar kii gai thi
 After nine years, the Rajasthan High Court has given its decision in it
 zaahir he ki jain samudaay saamaajik or raajnneetik rup se prabhaavshaalee to he hi or court ke aadesh ko kriyanvit karnaa har sarkaar ke liye mushkil hoga
 Especially because according to the orders of the court in this, Section 309 of Indian Penalty Number will be applicable
 santhara ke khilaaf vakil rahe madhav mitra ne bataaya, inkaa kahana he ki ye suicide nahin he, lekin jab nirnay karte ho santhara lene kaa , to aapako pataa hota he ki aapkaa rigelt deth he, to yah suicide he or ek aparaadh he, jiske khilaaf dhara 309 lagu hoti he
 The comments santhara par jo roak lagi he usko lekar virodh pradarshan to ho hi rahe hai
 Can a person give up his life for any reason? kya santhara aatmahatya he yaa jivan kaa samarpan, jisase aatma majboot hokar moksh ko praapt karti he? vivaad kaa abhi ant nahin hua he, kyonki ab rajasthan hoicourt ke nirnay ke khilaaf supreme court main ek REVISION PETITION daayar ho chuki he
 The assumption behind this is that if someone takes santhara on their own will, they attain salvation, but the Rajasthan High Court termed it a suicide and said that it is a crime punishable under Section 309
 rajasthan hoicourt ne santhara par roak laga di he, jise lekar jain samudaay ne alag-alag jagah virodh pradarshan kiye hai
 Ajay Kala, a well-known businessman from Jaipur who joined the protest in Jaipur today, said, "we are not talking about right to die
" yah har jaini kaa janmasiddh adhikaar he ki vah dharm nibhaate hue kaise apane jivan kaa nirnay karata he

 It is obvious that the Jain community is socially and politically influential and it will be difficult for every government to implement the court order
 khaskar isliye kyonki isamen ab court ke adeshon ke mutabik, bhartiya dand sankhya ki dhara 309 lagu ho jaaegi
 Madhav Mitra, who was a lawyer against Santhara, said, "they say that this is not a suicide, but when you decide to take Santhara, then you know that your result is death, then it is a suicide and a crime against Section 309 applies
 tippaniyan Protests are already taking place regarding the ban on Santhara
 kya insaan apana jivan kisi bhi kaaran se tyaag saktaa he? Is Santhara a suicide or a surrender to life, through which the soul becomes strong and attains salvation?

 rajasthan hoicourt ne santhara par roak laga di he, jise lekar jain samudaay ne alag-alag jagah virodh pradarshan kiye hai
 Ajay Kala, a well-known businessman from Jaipur who joined the protest in Jaipur today, said, "we are not talking about right to die

 santhara par yachika 2006 main daayar kii gai thi
 After nine years, the Rajasthan High Court has given its decision in it
 zaahir he ki jain samudaay saamaajik or raajnneetik rup se prabhaavshaalee to he hi or court ke aadesh ko kriyanvit karnaa har sarkaar ke liye mushkil hoga
 Especially because according to the orders of the court in this, Section 309 of Indian Penalty Number will be applicable
 santhara ke khilaaf vakil rahe madhav mitra ne bataaya, inkaa kahana he ki ye suicide nahin he, lekin jab nirnay karte ho santhara lene kaa , to aapako pataa hota he ki aapkaa rigelt deth he, to yah suicide he or ek aparaadh he, jiske khilaaf dhara 309 lagu hoti he
 The comments santhara par jo roak lagi he usko lekar virodh pradarshan to ho hi rahe hai

 Let me tell you that in 1931, to commemorate the 85th anniversary of those who lost their lives in the fight against the monarchy, Geelani tried to go to the martyrs' cemetery

 Maishana Masood Azhar, the leader of jaish-e-mohammed, has received a stir in India's politics on the relief from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
 congress party is mudde ko modi sarkaar kii vifal videsh niti kaa nateeja bataa rahi he, to bhaajapa ne congress par hi aarope laga diya he
 The attack on Rahul Gandhi has been answered by Omar Abdullah, former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir and leader of the National Conference
 umr ne likhaa ki rahul par sawaal uthaane se pehle bijepi ko apane ghar main dekhnaa chahie
 Regarding Masood Azhar, Omar Abdullah tweeted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has surrendered to China
 saath hi unhone jammu-kashmir main chunaav naa karvaa kar pakistan ke aage bhi sarender kar diya he
 How can the BJP claim that it has adopted a strict policy against terrorism
 PM Modi surrendered to China on Azhar and surrendered to Pakistan & its proxies by delaying elections in J&K
 How can the BJP claim to have been tough on internal security and tough against terror? Https: / / t
 co / oovvp9cedj— Omar Abdullah (@omarabdullah)march 14, 2019iske alaava unhone ravishankar prasad ko bhi jawaab diya
 Omar wrote, "minister, your government gave Pakistan a chance to celebrate the victory only when you did not hold the by-elections in Anantnag and you are no longer holding assembly elections
 agar pakistan ko jashn manaane kaa mauka koi de rahaa he to vah rahul gandhi nahin
 Look at your house too
 ’’gauratlab he ki guuruuvaar subah hi china ke masale par rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko gheraa tha
 Rahul had tweeted that PM Modi is afraid of Chinese President Xi Jinping, which is why he is not speaking anything against China
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav ke elaan se pehle atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim ki jammu-kashmir main loksabhaa-vidhansabha chunaav saath main ho sakate hai
 But this did not happen, since which the National Conference and PDP have been circulating the central government on this issue
 umr abdulla ne aarope lagaaya he ki bhaajapa apane phaayde ke liye JK main vidhansabha chunaav nahin kara rahi he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah are churning for Mission 2019 along with Chief Ministers of 15 BJP ruled states in Delhi today
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii aitihaasik jeet main desh ke paanch rajyon kii ahm bhoomika rahi thi
 Currently, BJP has governments in these five states
 bijepi shasit in rajyon main kul 208 loksabhaa siten hai
 Of these, the NDA won 193 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi ko 172 siton or sahyogi dalon ko 21 siten mili thim
 In such a situation, Modi's return to power in 2019 depends on the Chief Ministers of these five states
 1
 In Uttar Pradesh, Bharosanarendra Modi's entire lineage on Yogi Adityanath rests on Uttar Pradesh
 upi kii satta par yogi adityanath kabiz hai
 In the last Lok Sabha election, BJP had managed to win 71 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP
 iske alaava 2 siten bijepi kii sahyogi apana dal ko mili thi
 In this way, NDA got 73 seats
 iske alaava 2017 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bhi bijepi aitihaasik jeet hasil karke satta par virajman hui thi
 But this time the bjp's equation seems to be deteriorating with the coming close to the SP-BSP
 2014 ke baad se teen loksabhaa siton par upachunaav hue hai
 BJP has lost all three seats
 aise main maujuuda samay main bijepi ke paas 68 siten bachi hai
 It is not easy for the party to repeat the results like 2014
 2
 Madhya Pradesh: Betting on Shivraj Chauhan, Shivraj Singh Chauhan has been in power for the last 13 years
 jabaki bijepi 15 saal se satta main he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP managed to win 27 out of 29 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 haalanki baad main hue ratlam-jhabua sansadeey seat par upachunaav main bijepi ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Thus BJP currently has 26 seats
 2019 main piem modi kii vaapasi kii ummiido bhare rajya main madhya pradesh kaa naam bhi aata he
 The anti-incumbency wave is seen against Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 loksabhaa se pehle is saal hone vaala vidhansabha chunaav rajya ke siyaasi mizaaj ko tay karegaa
 But looking at the results of the by-elections in the state, repeating the previous result is a big challenge for the BJP
 3
 Rajasthan: History will repeat again under Vasundhara Raje's rule, Rajasthan has played an important role in bringing Narendra Modi to the throne of power in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 rajya kii kul 25 loksabhaa siten hai, bijepi ne vipaksh kaa safaya karte hue 25 kii 25 sabhi siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 However, in the subsequent by-elections in Ajmer and Alwar Lok Sabha seats, the BJP had to face a crushing defeat at the hands of the Congress
 is tarah se bijepi ke paas philhal 23 siten bachi he
 Vasundhara Raje is the Chief Minister in Rajasthan
 aise main rajya main nattejey dohraane kii jimmedaari bhi vasundhara raaje ke kandhon par hai
 The way anti-incumbency is seen against Vasundhara Raje
 aise main loksabhaa se pehle hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey 2019 kii dasha or disha tay karenge
 However, repeating results like 2014 is not easy for the BJP
 4
 Gujarat: Rupani will be able to maintain the bjp's record, Gujarat is considered to be the strongest fortress of the BJP
 bijepi pichley do dashak se satta par kabiz he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP eliminated the opposition and managed to win all the 26 Lok Sabha seats of the state
 narendra modi ke dilli ke singhaasana par virajman hone ke baad se rajya main bijepi kii pakad kamjor hui he
 As a result of this, BJP has come down to 100 seats in last year's assembly elections held for the first time in two decades
 jabaki congress kaa graph badha he
 Vijay Rupani is in control of Gujarat's power, but due to lack of attitude and style like Narendra Modi, many bjp's difficulties are seen in the way
 rupani raaj main bijepi pichley record ko dohraye ye kahana mushkil he
 5
 maharashtra: fadanvis kii agnipariksha2019 main narendra modi kii vaapasi kaa daaromadar main maharashtra ahm bhoomika rahegi
 Maharashtra has a total of 48 Lok Sabha seats
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi 23 or uski sahyogi shivasena 18 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 The Congress was reduced to 2 and NCP 4 seats
 jabaki ek seat swabhimaan paksh ko gai thi
 However, the NCP has won in the by-elections held after the BJP left the party from Gondia parliamentary seat
 is tarah se bijepi ke paas 22 siten hi bachi he
 In the assembly elections held a few months after the Lok Sabha, the BJP broke away from the Shiv Sena and emerged as the single largest party
 haalanki baad main bijepi ne shivasena ke saath milakar rajya ke satta par kabiz hui or devendra fadanvis mukhyamantri bane
 But the way the Maratha and Dalit movements stood up in the last four years has made the BJP sleepless
 itnaa hi nahin shivasena or bijepi ke riste bhi manmutav bhare rahe hai
 Both parties have indicated to contest separately in 2019
 jabaki vahiin, congress or ensipi ek saath milakar chunaav ladane kii baat kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, the results of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections are not easy for the BJP
 dilli ke dipti siem or shiksha mantri manish sisodiya ne EWS cote ke tahat hone vaale daakhile ke mudde par aaj ek apaat baithak bulaai he
 In fact, parents of children of schools are complaining about the admission under this quota
 tippaniyan Along with this, the teams of the Education Department have visited different private schools and inspected the report of how the schools are behaving with the parents at the time of admission
 aapako bataa den ki is baar dilli sarkaar ne EWS cote main daakhile kaa kaam apane haath main le liya he
 That is, after the online application, through the lottery, the government is telling the private schools to whom it should be admitted in this quota
 lekin jab mata-pita daakhile ke liye skool ja rahe hai to unako skool kii taraf khadi kii ja rahi bahut si pareshaaniyon kii shikaayat sarkaar ko mil rahi he
 This meeting will be held at 1 pm in Delhi Secretariat
 saath hi shiksha vibhaag kii tiimon ne alag-alag privet skool main jaakar muyna kiya he jisamen daakhile ke samay main skool kis tarah bartaav abhibhavak ke saath kar rahe hai us report kii bhi samiksha hogi
 Let us tell you that this time the Delhi Government has taken the job of admission in the EWS quota
 yani online aavedan ke baad latary ke zariye sarkaar nijee skulon ko bataa rahi he ki usko is cote main kisko daakhila dena he
 But when the parents are going to school for admission, then they are getting complaints about many problems being raised towards the school
 dopaher ek baje ye baithak dilli sachivalay main hogi

 a film was released in theaters on this day 22 years ago, which can truly be called India's biggest war film
 jepi datta kii mashhoor film border 1971 ke bharat pakistan yuddh par aadhaarit thi
 In 2019, films like Uri may be made which are better in terms of technology, cinematography and budget, but if it is about engagement, emotions and nostalgia with a film then it is difficult to get a better war film from the border
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki is film ko rashtriya ekikaran ke liye best feechar film kaa naragis dutt aword bhi diya gaya tha
 Border, which won 3 National Awards, was the highest-grossing film of the year 1997
 jepi datta yun to kai non war filmein bana chuke hai lekin ve apni yuddh vaali filmon ke chalate hi charchaa main rahe hai or inamen sabase pramukh naam border kaa hi he
 Dutta claims that his film 'border' was the first film in the history of Indian cinema to openly identify Pakistan as an enemy
 jepi datta ko sarhadon se kitna lagaav he iskaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unki pehali film bhi border ke bare main thi
 The name of that film was 'sarhad'
 is film kii kahani bhartiya yudhbandiyon ke bare main thi
 It stars Vinod Khanna, Bindia Goswami and Mithun Chakraborty playing the lead
 film kii shooting 1976 main shuru hui jo 60 percent puri ho chuki thi lekin aarthik kaarnon se ise band karnaa padaa
 His brother Deepak was a squadron leader in the Indian Air Force and died while on duty
 usee kii yaad main je
 P
 datta ne ‘sarhad’ plan kii thi
 The special thing is that when Datta was going to make a 'border', PV Narasimha Rao was the Prime Minister
 datta ne unhen arji bhejkar unase shooting ke liye manjuuri or sena ke sahyog kii baat likhi thi
 Narasimha Rao had read the application and wrote a small note under it, 'give full support
 ' kaha jaataa he narsimha raav ne kaha tha, 'ye film to banani hi chahie
 After the release of "border", their discussion spread far and wide, threatening Dutta's security
 us dauraan ke police kamishnar ne datta ko phone kiya tha or kaha tha ki unki jaan ko khatra he isliye unki suraksha ke liye do hathiyaarband log bheje gaye jo teen-chaar maheene unki suraksha main rahe the
 JP had also taken a reference to his diary for the production of this film, in which he shared the moments spent in the air force of his brother
 unhone apni film border ko apane bhai ke liye dedicket bhi kii thi
 Sunny Deol played the role of Indian Army officer Kuldeep Singh Chandapuri in the film
 kuldeep ko bhartiya sena ne unke parakram ke liye mahavir chakra sena ke sammaan se nawaja tha
 There were many stars in this film, but there were many stars who missed being a part of this film
 sanjay dutt is film main pehle wing commander endi bajva kaa role karne vaale the lekin unke jail vivaad ke chalate is role ko jaiki shroff ne nibhaayaa tha
 Significantly, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan, Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgan and Saif Ali Khan were approached for the role of Lieutenant Dharamvir in this film, but the role was eventually played by the new actor Akshaye Khanna
 salmaan is role ke liye taiyaar nahin the vahi aamir us samay ishk kii shooting kar rahe the
 Saif and Akshay refused to be a part of this film, Ajay did not want to be a part of the multistarrer film
 iske alaava manisha koirala ne bhi is film ko sin kiya tha lekin unhone baad main is film ke liye manaa bhi kar diya tha
 Apart from this, Juhi Chawla turned down the role of Kuldeep Singh's wife, which was later played by Tabu
 juhi darasal is film main chota role nahin karnaa chaahati thim
 This film is also called India's biggest war movie because some arrangements were made for this film which had never happened before
 masalan, film ke liye asli hoker hunters kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 These weapons were also used in war
 kai asli sainikon ne film kii shooting main bhaag liya tha or film main zyaadaatar hathiyaar masalan tanks, army jeep or baaki hathiyaar bhi vahiin the jinhen yuddh main istemaal kiya gaya tha
 To give real feel to the shooting of this film, shooting was done in the barren desert of Bikaner
 bhale hi yah kaha jaataa ho ki khubsuurati to dekhne vaale kii ankhon main hoti he, lekin shodhakartaaon par bharosa karen, to unka kahana he ki kisi bhi jode ko apana saathi hi sabase pyaara lagata he

 India has reached the final for the third time
 1983 ke champion ko duusari baar khitaab jeetne ke liye ab2 april ko mumbai main srilankai chunauti todani hogi
 Luck was with India at the PCA Stadium
 sachin tendulkar ne chaar jeevandaan or refral kaa phayda uthaakar 115 gend par 85 ran banaae
 Virender Sehwag (38) gave the team a stormy start, but the pace slowed down due to the shaking of Wahab Riaz (five wickets for 46 runs)
 suresh raina ne aakhir main 36 ran kii acchhee pari kheli, jisase bharat ne nau wicket par 260 ran kaa chunauteepurn score khadaa kiya
 The bowlers made a difference in the match
 bhartiya gendbaajon ne behad anushaasit khel dikhaaya or niyamit antaraal main wicket lekar pakistan ko badi saajhedaari nahin nibhaane di
 misbah-ul-haq scored 56 off 76 balls and Pakistan 49
 5 over main 231 ran hi bana paaya
 The five bowlers from India - Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Munaf Patel, Harbhajan Singh and Yuvraj Singh took two wickets each
 bharat ko sahvaag ne tufaani shuruyaat dilaai or tab lag rahaa tha ki team 300 ran ke paar pahonchegi, lekin bich main niyamit antaraal main wicket ganvaane se ran gati dhimi padi
 The situation was that the ball did not cross the boundary line for 15 overs at one time
 sahvaag ne phir se chaukaa jadkar khaataa kholaa
 His target was Umar Gul, against whom he smashed the Pakistani attack with eight fours off 19 balls
 unhone gul ke duusare over main paanch chauke jadkar stroke play kaa bemisaal najaara pesh kiya, lekin jaise hi vah chuke, out ho gaye
 In the first over of Riyaz, the ball pitched on the middle and leg stump, he was lbw and the referral also went against him
 tendulkar kaa bhagya ne puraa saath diya
 She gave a good view of her artistry and placement, but in the meantime she refrained from visiting the pavilion six times
 tendulkar jab 23 ran par the to ampire ian gold ne ajmal kii apil par unhen pagabaadha de diya tha
 The ball was in the line, but the replay seemed to leave the leg stump
 gold ko faisla badalanaa padaa
 Tendulkar got the benefit of the doubt on the appeal of stumping the next ball
 master blaster ko iske baad 27 ran par misbah, 45 ran par younus khan or 70 ran par kamran akmal ne jeevandaan diya
 Afridi was the unfortunate bowler on all three occasions
 tendulkar jab 81 ran par the, tab mohammad hafeez kii gend par umr akmal ne unka kaich tapakaaya
 Meanwhile, falling for three consecutive wickets at the other end also put pressure on Tendulkar
 gambhir kuch aakarshak shot lagane ke baad hafeez kii flite leti gend par chook gaye or baaki kaam wicketiper ne puraa kar diya, lekin vah riyaj the, jinhone bharatiyon ko hilaa kar rakhaa
 Dice reversed in the 26th over of the match
 riyaj ne tab viraat kohli :9: or yuvaraj ko lagaataar gend par out kiya
 With the echo of the applause, Yuvraj, who stepped on the crease, was bowled on the low-lying fulltas, taking a slight swing
 darshakon kaa dil tut gaya
 His beating had increased
 dhoni ne riyaj kii hetric nahin banane di, lekin bhartiya team dabaav main aa chuki thi or pakistani gendbaaji haaavee ho gayi the
 The point was that after the 30th over, the ball had to wait till the 45th over to see the boundary line and in the meantime the team lost the wickets of Tendulkar and Dhoni
 dhoni ko bhi jeevandaan mila lekin vah iskaa phayda nahin uthaa paye
 Kamran off Riaz off his catch but in the same over, the Indian captain was lbw
 refral bhi dhoni ko nahin bachaa paaya
 Gul had given 41 runs in his first four overs and he did not stop even after that
 ballebaaji powerple ke pehle over main raina ne un par teen chauke jade 
 Meanwhile, second-seeded Harbhajan Singh (12) was caught by Ajmal in the second, while Riaz took the fifth wicket as Zaheer Khan (9)
 pakistan par dabaav banane ke liye wicket nikaalnaa jaruri tha or aise main yuvaraj ne gendbaaji main kamaal dikhaaya
 His left-arm spin bowling has wreaked havoc on the opposing batsmen in this tournament and Mohali's pitch was also no exception
 apane gharelu darshakon ke saamne yuvaraj ne pehle asad shafic (30) kaa middle stump ukhada jo sidhi gend ko cat karnaa chaahate the
 In the next over, he lured veteran Younis Khan (13) for a lofted cover drive
 umr akmal (29) ne yuvaraj ke lagaataar overon main ek- ek chakka jadkar unki lay bigaadane or ran rate badhaane kii koshish kii, lekin dhoni kii chaturaai bhari captaini kii tarif kerani hogi
 He then handed the ball to Harbhajan, whose straight ball like arm ball, Umar was bowled
 harbhajan ne yadi umr ko hairaan kiya to munaf ne yahi kaam abdul rajjak (3) ke liye kiya
 Razzaq wanted to cut on his leg cutter, but before he could understand anything, the ball had blown off the stump
 bharatiyon kii anushaasit gendbaaji kaa alam yah tha ki 37wein over main pehla atirikt ran gaya
 Pakistan's hopes were set on captain Shahid Offredi, but as soon as he returned to the pavilion by waving Harbhajan's fulltoss in the air, the Indian victory was just a formality
