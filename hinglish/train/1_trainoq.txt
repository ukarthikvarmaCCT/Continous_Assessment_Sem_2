 Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopananda of dwarka-sharda Peeth gave rise to controversy by saying that Sai Baba should not be worshiped
 is mudde par ajtak kii anjana om kashyap ne unase baatcheet kii
 Excerpts: What is Shankaracharya's objection to Sai Pooja? In Sanatan religion, the unworthy is not worshiped
 ayogy kii upasna kaa fal ulataa hota he
 Sai is untrue because he has died
 hindu marane vaale kisi achetan kii puja nahin karte
 Even if we do idol worship, after consecrating the life in the idol
 sai main aisi koi yogyata nahin ki unki puja ho
 Sai Chillam used to drink and eat meat
 ve ekadshi par brahmanon ko jabaran maance khilaate the
 Sai used to say that the master of all is one
 ve khud ko bhagwaan nahin kehete the
 Sai used to say that all of Allah is one
 jiskaa maalik koi doosraa ho, uski puja kaise ho sakati he?aapatti sai kii shakhsiyat se he yaa unke ird gird rache ja rahe aadambar se?hamaari aapatti sai se nahin, unke bhakton kii puja se he
 His devotees do not follow his own principles
 sai ke naam par logon ko bhramit kiya ja rahaa he
 Is the economics of religion behind your opposition? Because more offerings now go to Sai temples

 While the BJP is trying to be aggressive with readiness to send the Fortress to Karnataka, the Congress is giving a befitting reply to the attacks to save its fort in the south

 As soon as the BJP tries to put Siddaramaiah or his government in charge of the allegations by taking a claim on social media, the Congress's cyber army and Chief Minister Siddaramaiah immediately turn their back on the social media platform
 aakraamak andaaj main siddharmaiyabijepi ne press conference karke aarope lagaaya ki siddharmaiya ne malaysia main kaam kar rahe desh ke ek aarthik bhagode se keemtee tohfa kabool kiya or sabooton ke taur par tasviren saajha kii, to siddharmaiya ne turant palatwaar karte hue soshal media par pradhanmantri modi kii neerav modi ke saath tasviren saajha karte hue bijepi se hi sawaal khadaa kar diya
 This was not the first time Siddaramaiah responded to Modi and the BJP in his own words
 siddharmaiya karnataka main congress ke captain kii bhoomika behtareen tareeke se nibhaa rahe hai
 The same BJP is also raising questions on the Siddaramaiah government on all social media platforms through data
 congress mukt bharat ke abhiyaan main bijepi karnataka main apana jhanda fahraane ke liye betaab he or isiilie usne karnataka ke ran main yogi, modi or amit shah jaise apane sabhi suurama utaar rakhe hai
 At the same time, Rahul Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and other leaders from the Congress have also taken the front of their fort under the leadership of Siddaramaiah
 sibar yuddh ke maidan main koi kisi se kam sabit nahin ho rahaa he
 In Modi vs Siddaramaiah, the Prime Minister directs allegations against Siddaramaiah in election rallies, and without delay Siddaramaiah shoots arrows from the quiver of social media and moves towards the Prime Minister
 amit shah agar aaropon ke baan chhodte hai to siddharmaiya bhi turant dhaal se un hamalon ko naakaam kar dete hai
 When Yogis also came to preach, Siddaramaiah also drove Brahmastra, a North Indian one
 itnaa hi siddharmaiya ne akhabaaron main vigyaapan ke jariye modi or yediurppa ko mudde par khuli bahes karne kaa open chalange bhi de diya
 He also gave them a chance to decide for themselves the venue and date for the debate

 baar-baar fund maangane ke baad kahin jaakar dilli sarkaar ne fund jari to kiya, lekin itnaa bhi saaf kar diya ki aage se fund ke liye dilli sarkaar par ashrith na rahe
 The East MCD then prepared a proposal to improve its financial position, under which the corporation is now going to collect house tax from around 243 illegal colonies in East Delhi, but it will not be that easy, because there is a large vote bank in illegal colonies
 
 is vot bank ko koi bhi ise naaraaz nahin karnaa chahta
 This is the reason that when the corporation first brought the proposal in 2011, the Sheela government stopped it

 16) American billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in a US prison cell on Saturday
 epstin naaballig ladakiyon kaa yon shoshan karne ke aaropon kaa saamana kar rahe the
 Epstein has befriended high profile people like current US President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and Britain's Prince Andrew
 unhone sex trephiking or sajeesh ke aaropon ko swikaarne se inkaar kar diya tha
 He was in jail since his arrest on July 6
 kuch america media reporton main kaha gaya he ki epstin ne neuyork sthit jail kii apni kothri main faansee laga lee or unka shav sthaneey samyaanusaar subah 7
 Recovered at 30 pm
 jabaki anya logon kaa kahana he ki shanivaar tadake unhen dil kaa daura padaa, uske baad unhen aspataal le jaaya gaya, jahaan unka nidhan ho gaya
 He died at a time when documents surfaced in New York a day earlier revealed the extent to which he had sexually abused young girls at his home in New York and Virgin Iceland
 epstin par aarope tha ki unhone 18 saal tak kii ladakiyon ko 2002 se 2005 ke bich apane manahattan or florida sthit awaason main sex gatividhiyon ke liye bhugtan kiya tha
 Epstein was found unconscious in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York three weeks ago, following which he was being monitored for fear of suicide
 unki gardan par ghaav ke nishaan the, jo aatmahatya kii koi koshish yaa jail main kisi hamale kii nishaani lag rahe the
 Epstein was convicted in a Florida case in 2008 on charges of purchasing girls up to 18 years of age for prostitution
 ceiling ko lekar dilli main kai dinon se kaarobaari pareshaan he
 In such a situation, the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government has tried to support them in the past one week
 kaarobaariyon ke dilli band ke dauraan bhi mantriyon se lekar saikadon kaaryakarta ye dikhaane main jute rahen ki dilli ke kaarobaariyon ke asli hamdard vahi hai
 However, is this sympathetic shoulder with the businessmen of the common man party of any use or is it just a political shoulder? Which is being used to gain political advantage
 dilli ke jin 7 lakh vyapaariyon-kaarobaariyon kii gardan par jo ceiling naam kii talwaar lataki hui he, uske zimmedaar emsidi, centre or dilli sarkaar teenon hi hai
 The Delhi government cannot stand the blame by just blaming them both
 dilli main 351 sadaken aisi hai, jahaan ceiling ho rahi he or in sadakon ko dilli sarkaar ko notiphoi karnaa he
 The Delhi government has not yet made the proposal that can be sent to the central government
 haa aam aadmi party kaarobaariyon ke kandhe par bandook rakhkar virodhiyon par nishaanaa khub saadh rahi he
 What can happen next on sealing, if the Central Government can bring an ordinance
 supreme court se isi adhyadesh ke zarie samay maang sakati he
 According to experts, it is not easy for the central government
 agar centre sarkaar aisa karti he to supreme court naa sirf ise manaa kar saktaa he, balki ye bhi poocha jaasakata he ki jab master plan 2021 banaaya gaya to ise baahar kyon rakhaa gaya tha
 Now why is it being talked about giving up
 vahiin emsidi hi supreme court kii banaai monitering cameti ke sathclingdrive chalaa rahi he, lihaaja yahaan ye bhi jaananaa jaruri he ki emsidi ke paas kya kya opshan hai
 Areas that were constructed before 1961 and fall in the special area
 master plan ye kahata he ki aise ilaakon main jab tak reedevlepment nahin hota, ceiling nahin ho sakati
 However, the MCD did not do its job on time and now in collaboration with the Monitoring Committee of the Supreme Court is also hammering the sealing name in the special area
 master plan 2021 kaa chapter 15 ye kahata he ki agar basament main hone vaali profeshnal activity par kanvarjan charge diya gaya he to phir vahaan ceiling nahin ho sakati
 Professionals such as CA, doctors and lawyers come under this purview, but MCD first allowed a variety of businesses to settle in the basement
 ab kanvarjan charge dene ke baavjood vahaan bhi ceiling ke kaam ko anjaam de rahi he
 In fact, Delhi has suffered the same ceilings even 13 years ago
 2005 main bhi dilli main ceiling ne kaarobaariyon ko dahala diya tha
 It is also necessary to tell the 7 lakh businessmen of Delhi that how they got rid of ceilings a decade ago
 
 
 
 Tell you when, what has happened - Special Provision Bill was brought in 12 May 2006 - Bill passed in 7 days, made law - May 13 Report of Tajinder Khanna Committee recommended to increase FAR
 -master plan ko saal 2006 main do baar amend kiya gaya
 - Incorporated into 2021 master plan according to mixed land use - Notified on Master Plan 2021 in March 2007 Now the question arises that the master plan under which sealing is done in Delhi, if it is changed a decade ago
 Could it be, then why are the governments of today allowing the business of businessmen to get sealing gifts? rajdhani dilli main ek baar phir aag lagane kii ghatana saamne ai he

 Let us tell you that the former MLA has already told his daughter the victim of Love Jihad
 counselling centre se baahar aane ke baad surendra nath singh ne kaha ki jo logon main nafrat paidaa karnaa chaahate hai
 Those who want to occupy the world by increasing their population or those who want to make people of other religion in the name of love jihad, they are the same

 If love is a jihad, it will be a massacre - former MLA Surendra Nath Singh said what is the meaning of love jihad? Love jihad means to make a Hindu girl special
 agar aisa hoga to katleam hoga
 Surendra Nath Singh said, 'I have to tell all peace loving people that brothers look at their religion

 Because if Hindustan starts interfering in religion, then other religions in this world will disappear

 Prior to this, he was the Addition Director General (law and Order) in the West Bengal Police
 rajeev kumaar (rajeev Kumar) kaa transfar unke shilong se lautne ke thik baad kiya gaya
 Significantly, in the Saradha chit fund case, Rajiv Kumar appeared before the CBI following the order of the Supreme Court

 Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), STF Abhishek Singh, who sits in his office of the Special Task Force (STF) of Police, located in Gomtinagar, Lucknow, says that in October last year, he received letters from the UP Director General of Police (DGP) office as usual
 Were looking at inhen patron ke dher main pashchim bengal ke police upmahanireekshak (diiji), siidi (oparation) kaa ek patr bhi tha jo dijipi karyaalay se hota hua estf daftar pahunchaa tha
 In that letter, the complaint was rigged in the LT Grade Teacher Recruitment Examination of the State Public Service Commission (UPPSC) of Uttar Pradesh held on July 29 last year
 kuch din baad estf daftar ko kolkata kii salt lake city ke shukantnagar main rahane vaale ashok dev choudhary kaa ek gopneey patr mila jisamen alti grad shikshak bhartee pariksha main paper li kii jaankaree thi
 a team of Additional Superintendent of Police Satyasen Yadav, Deputy Superintendent of Police Alok Singh and Vinod Kumar Singh, led by SSP Abhishek Singh, started an investigation into the entire case
 ashok se estf ne poochtacha kii
 The STF started to see a big scam in UPPSC as soon as the investigation of the evidence related to the paper leak from Ashok in LT grade teacher recruitment examination started
 abhishek singh bataate hai, ''ashok dev choudhary pashchim bengal kaa ek 'soshal activist' he jo upipiessi main chal rahe paper li ke dhandhe kaa pardaafash karne ke liye is racket main shaamil hua tha
 ÓÓ Ashok became close to Kaushik Kumar, owner of Security Printing Press, Kolkata, who printed the UPPSC question paper and understood the 'modus operandi' of Solver Gang
 ashok ne estf ko un abhyarthiyon kii puri jaankaree sabooton sahit di jinhone alti grad pariksha ke saamaajik vigyaan or hindi prashnptr kharide the
 The STF started a strict vigil on UPPSC exam controller Anju Katiyar and owner of Security Printing Press, Kaushik Kumar
 isi bich ashok se estf ko jaankaree mili ki kowshik upipisies kii nai pratiyogi pariksha ke paper li karne ke liye varanasi main he
 The STF arrested Kaushik from Varanasi on 27 May and recovered the question papers of the main examination of PCS-2018 from him
 kowshik se kadai ke saath poochtacha main upipiessi main chale rahe racket se paradaa hat gaya (dekhen graphics)
 STF came to know about the complicity of UPPSC exam controller Anju Latha Katiyar in the whole case
 30 may ko anju lata ke giraftaar hote hi pratiyogi parikshaon kii taiyaari kar rahe abhyarthiyon main hadakamp much gaya
 His flock started gathering outside the State Public Service Commission office in Prayagraj
 dharna-pradarshan kaa daur shuru ho gaya
 Angry candidates captured the main gate of the commission and wrote a 'chillam Seva Commission' on it
 paper out karne ke dhandhe ke khulaase se sakate main ai pradesh kii yogi adityanath kii sarkaar ne isaki jaanch 'special investigeshan team' (esaity) ke hawaale kar di
 The PCS-2018 main examination to be held from 17 June was postponed
 agle kuch maheenon main hone vaali nai pratiyogi parikshaon kaa bhavishya adhar main latak gaya he
 At the same time, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath says, "the mess in the commission is the sin of the previous SP government
 yuvaaon ke bhavishya se khilwaad karne waalon se sarkaar sakhti se nibat rahi he
 These people are in jail
 ''kendrikrut vyavastha par sawaalparikshaon ke prashnptr kahaan chhapate hai, isaki jaankaree ayog ke adhyaksh or sachiv ko bhi nahin hoti, keval pariksha niyantrak ko isaki jaankaree hoti he
 In any examination, three sets of papers are prepared by experts
 sabhi visheshgy sil band lipaphe main paper rakhkar pariksha niyantrak ko saunp dete hai
 The Controller of Examinations hands one of these envelopes to the printing press operator without opening these sealed envelopes
 printing press sanchaalak puri gopneeyata ke saath us sil band lipaphe main rakhe prashnptr ko chhapakar ayog ko saunpta he
 In January, the STF gave information about the leaking of papers in LT Grade Teacher Recruitment Examination to Anju Lata, Controller of Public Service Commission
 estf ne shikshak bhartee pariksha kaa parinaam ghoshit na karne ko bhi kaha tha, baavjood iske pariksha niyantrak ne march se pariksha parinaam ghoshit karnaa shuru kar diya
 This also put the Controller of Examinations in doubt
 do saal pehle rajya lok seva ayog kii pariksha niyantrak kaa pad sanbhaalane vaali anju lata 2002 main ayog kii piesies pariksha top karne ke kaaran charchaa main ai thim
 During the deployment of Anju, the Public Service Commission conducted a total of five examinations and all these are now under investigation
 ayog kai printing press se alag-alag parikshaon ke paper chhapavata he
 This information is kept completely confidential
 priting press ke bare main keval pariksha niyantrak ko jaankaree hoti he
 The Chairman of the Commission between 2000 and 2004, Prof
 ke
 B
 pandeya ke kaarykaal main hi anju lata ne pisies pariksha main top kiya tha
 Pro
 pandeya kehete hai, ''ayog ne kendrikrut dhang se parikshaon ke prashnpatron ko taiyaar karne kaa jimmaa ek hi aadmi ko kyon diya, isaki jaanch honi chahie
 This is the foundation of corruption
 '' pisies-2015 kii pariksha se pehle prashnpatron kii packaging ayog main hi hoti thi
 The commission changed the system after a question paper for the preliminary examination of PCS-2015 was dismissed from an examination center in Lucknow
 ab prashnpatron kii packaging bhi printing press main hone lagi
 Pro
 pandeya kehete hai, ''nijee or gaiyr jimmedaar haathon main prashnpatron kii packaging kii vyavastha ne paper out karnaa aasaan kar diya
 "step-by-step disturbances" In the previous SP government, more than a dozen recruitment examinations of the Commission are facing CBI investigation
 ayog ne chhavi sudhaarney ke naam par apni parikshaon main sangh lok seva ayog kaa pattern lagu karne, pisies (je) praarambhik pariksha main mines marking, intervyuu board ke gathan kii prakriya ko gopneey rakhane jaise kadam uthaae hai
 Amit Rana, a candidate for the Commission's examinations, says, "the direct recruitment examination in various departments is still going on in the old fashion
 antar keval screening pariksha kaa he
 The decision to make merit by adding screening test and interview marks is buried in the files
 '' kai sawaal uthne ke baad bhi ayog apni parikshaon main paardarshita baratane ke mood main nahin he
 For this reason, during the BJP government, the examinations of the Commission are also targeted (see box)
 17 june se prastaavit pisies-2018 kii mukhya pariksha bhale hi alti grad shikshak bhartee pariksha kii gadbaditon ke chalate taal di gai ho par is par bhi vivaad bana hua tha
 For the first time, the Commission was going to conduct this main examination on a changed pattern
 pratiyogi parikshaon kii taiyaari kar rahe vinod pandeya bataate hai, ''abhyarthiyon kii maang thi ki purv kii bhaanti is baar bhi ayog badale pattern par hone vaali pariksha kaa model paper jari kare
 The Commission did not do it on purpose so that the cost of getting out the questions of the main examination could be charged
 '' printing press maalik kowshik kii giraftaar ke vakt usase pisies-2018 kii mukhya pariksha ke prashnptr baraamad hue the
 This has bolstered the allegations of the candidates
 ayog kii pariksha samiti bhi sawaalon ke ghere main he
 Avinesh Pandey, media in-charge of 'competitive Student Conflict Committee' says, "what was the role of the Commission's Examination Committee in the LT Grade Teacher Recruitment Examination? It should also be investigated
 ''khokhale system ke bharoseayog kii parikshaon main shuchita baratane kaa tantra kis kadar khokhla he, iskaa andaja yahaan karyrat sahaayak samiksha adhikariyon kii sthiti ko dekhakar lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The responsibility of extracting the result of examinations from scrutiny of application forms is the responsibility of Assistant Review Officers
 iske liye ayog main sahaayak samiksha adhikariyon ke kul 127 pad sweekrut hai par inamen kaam keval 25 hi kaam kar rahe hai
 The Commission has a total of 152 posts of Reviewing Officer, of which 50 are running vacant
 upipiessi main karyrat samiksha adhikari arvind mishra bataate hai, ''sahaayak samiksha adhikariyon ke rikt padon ko bharne main sabase badi baadha abhyarthiyon ke paas 'o level computer certificate' kii yogyata kaa hona he
 This is a difficult computer course
 jo vyakti 'o level computer course' kar letaa he aamtaur par vah sahaayak samiksha adhikari ke pad ke liye aavedan nahin karata
 That is why the vacancies of the Commission are not being filled
 '' karmchaariyon or adhikariyon kii kami ke kaaran hi supreme court ke aadesh ke baavjood may main pisies (je) kaa antim nateeja ghoshit nahin ho paaya he
 However, the officers and employees of the Commission are demonstrating the action of STF as unilateral
 upi lok seva ayog adhikari-karmchaaree sangh ke adhyaksh dinesh kumaar kehete hai, ''bina kisi saboot ke estf ne ayog ke pariksha niyantrak ko giraftaar kiya he
 STF is yet to recover the amount which the printing press owner had given to Anju Katiyar
 yahaan tak ki estf ke paas alti grad shikshak bhartee pariksha kaa prashnptr li hone kaa bhi koi saboot nahin he
 That is why the officers are making excuses that the papers were burnt
 '' ayog ke itihaas main yah pehla mauka he jab bhrashtachar ke aarope main pariksha niyantrak kii giraftaar or nilamban hua he
 Apparently, the challenge before the STF is to destroy every link of the network of paper leaks in the Commission with evidence

 What is the stand? Does this not prove that development is not an issue for them? ve in jaisi chizon kaa sahaara le rahe hai, isi baat se sabit hota he ki vikaas ke maamle main unke paas dikhaane ke liye kuch nahin he

 (from input language) (input bhashaa se) Is there a BJP wave in the country before the general elections? If you look at the TV channels, every new day it shows a person as a decisive and charismatic personality, who has a map ready to free the country from corruption and take the economy to a new height
 lekin kya yah sach he yaa phir ek vyakti ko mrug marichika banane ke liye media dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya hauva he, jise supreme court dwaara bedaag ghoshit karne ke baavjood khud par lage 2002 ke gujarat dange kaa dhabba dhonaa hoga
 It will be decided on May 16 whether Narendra Modi will become Prime Minister or not
 lekin is vakt jo baat logon ko pareshaan kar rahi he, vah media yaa phir electranik media ke kuch hisse dwaara modi kaa kiya ja rahaa mahimamandan he
 There is no doubt that Modi has emerged as a decisive and efficient leader who can change the economic scenario of the country, as he himself emphasizes the need to focus on development rather than on Hindutva
 lekin yah chipa hua tathy bhi he ki modi 2002 ke dange ke daag ko mitaane ke liye janata ke bich apni chhavi banane ke liye kaam kar rahe hai, kyonki unhen pataa he ki saat res course road kaa rasta itnaa aasaan nahin hoga? brands modi nae or puraane media kii rachana he

 How is Modi's media campaigning
 modi ke piem banane kii raah main ekmaatr khatra nai party aam aadmi party (aap) he
 Where the Congress looks like a sinking ship and many of its senior leaders do not want to taste politics, nor has any strong leader appeared in the Third Front
 bijepi ke liye 'aap' hi ekmaatr khatra he or media sahi yaa galat tareeke se iske sansthaapak arvind kejariwal ko badnaam kar rahi he
 It is a recognized fact that the media is an important weapon that can change the mind of the public, but is it fair to speak only in favor of a leader? Kejriwal cannot agree with what he said about Modi's campaign Had said to send the media to jail, but he has questioned the relevance of the media, whether the media is relevant? Only the media can answer this question and It's too hard
 lekin media khaskar televijan channel yah mahasoos nahin kar rahe ki kejariwal par rojaanaa kiye ja rahe prahaar se isaki vishwasaneeyata prabhavit ho sakati he
 Did the media forget the India Shining campaign run by the bjp-led NDA in 2004? The entire campaign was overshadowed by the BJP and the Congress-led UPA government came to power

 - input PTI The US has refused to say anything about whether India has as much right as the United States to take action against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack in Pakistan
 iske saath hi america ne al kaayda sargana osama bin laden ko maar giraane kii karrwai ko "bilkul anokhaa" bataaya
 When asked by reporters at the State Department spokesman, if the United States would take similar action in Pakistan against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack, when asked by reporters, Toner said, "I am so far away about such a campaign Don't even want to talk, which is absolutely unique in the history of America and the world
 " toner ne kaha, "yahaan ek aisa vyakti tha jo sambhavat: duniya kaa sabase vaanchit vyakti tha or usne na keval america nagarikon ke khilaaf balki puri duniya main logon ke khilaaf jaghanya aparaadhon ko anjaam diya tha

 hamane is sandarbh main jo kuch kaha he vah yah ki yah ek aisa vyakti tha, jiske khilaaf hamaare paas karrwai ke laayak khufia jaankaree thi
 We acted on it because we believe it was a direct and imminent threat to America

 Indians were also eyeing the results of the Pak election
 bahut se bharatiyon ko yah lagata he ki 'nayaa pakistan' banane kii baat karne vaale imran ke aane se shaayad bharat-paak rishton main kuch sudhaar ho
 But many experts of Pakistan themselves believe that Pakistan's relations with India are likely to deteriorate further with Imran
 asal main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan apane bhaashanon main imran ne kai baar bharat virdohi ravaiya apanaaya he
 During the election campaign, Imran Khan deliberately kept away from the Indian media and also criticized the international media on the charge of not supporting himself
 is tarah imran khan ke jeetne se pakistan or bharat ke rishton par kaaphi bada asar pad saktaa he
 He accused his anti-nawaz Sharif family that his family is part of an 'international agenda' that works against Pakistan
 unka kahana tha ki, 'navaj sharif aise international agenda ke agent hai, jiskaa uddeshy pakistan ko badnaam karnaa he
 He alleged that by adopting a 'soft attitude towards Modi', Nawaz Sharif was working to advance his business interests
 kashmir ke bare main unhone lagaataar yah kaha he ki bhartiya satta pratishthan kohinsa rokanihogi or iske liye sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main prastaav laana chahie
 Many Pakistanis observers believe that relations between India and Pakistan will worsen with Imran becoming the PM
 vah chunaav prachaar ke dauraan yah aarope lagaate rahe hai ki bharat navaj sharif kaa samarthan karata rahaa he or pakistan ke khilaaf mukhya sajeeshkarta he
 It is believed that Imran Khan will act at the behest of Pakistan Army in future and this means that there will be no improvement in the relationship between Pakistan and India
 vaise bhi bharat par kai aarope lagaakar imran khan ne rishton ko sudhaarney kii raah thodi mushkil kar lee he
 If there was nothing special about the policy of Kashmir or India in the propaganda or manifesto of Imran Khan, then even the experts are considering that he wants to keep the Indian policy according to the army and ISI
 'veere di wedding' main swara bhaskar ko unke ek bold seen kii vajah se khub trol kiya ja rahaa he
 Swara, however, responded to the trollers and termed his comments as 'paid trolls'
 ab swara kii maa, ira bhaskar ne bhi is seen par apni pratikriya di he
 Swara was trolled by a scene from Veere Di Wedding, Diya Karara replied, though Ira did not say anything directly on Swara's scene
 lekin unhone filmon main dikhaae jane vaale is tarah ke seens par jarur baat kii
 For information, the film Veere The Wedding featured an orgasm scene on Swara Bhaskar in which the actress is shown using a 'vibrator'
 kuch log jahaan is bold seen ke liye swara kii taareef kar rahe hen to vahiin kuch logon ne ise chip or valgar qaraar diya he
 Why is Swara Bhaskar trolled repeatedly? Sonam Kapoor told that she had done phd in Tish School of Arts at JNU and film historian Ira Bhaskar talked about Swara's bold scene from a website
 unhone kaha, 'main sabase pehle ye kahana chaahuungi ki sexuality indian cinema kaa subject nahin he, jise ki diarect pregent kiya ja sake
 If we talk about the history of Indian cinema, our cinema is quite different, it has developed in the last several years and our perspective on the erotic subject is very clear and mixed
 'unhone kaha-'sexuality yaa women dijair ko dikhaane ke liye gaanon kaa sahaara liya jaataa rahaa he, lekin kai chijen aisi hai jinhen gane main bhi sidhe taur par nahin filmaaya ja saktaa he
 Be it Hindi films, Tamil films or Bengali films
 haalanki kaaphi had tak filmon ke gaanon main irotic or sexuality imoshans ko darshaya jaataa rahaa he
 'ira Bharskar gave the example of the song' mughal-e-azam 'and said, "this film does not directly depict love making or sexual act
 " ira ne yahaan mahesh bhatta ke 'mughal-e-ajam' ko die gaye bayaan kii yaad dilaai
 In which Mahesh described that sequence of 'mughal-e-azam' as the most erotic sequence of Hindi cinema, in which Dilip Kumar turns his hand on Madhubala's face
 'ira ne mahilaon ke sexuali active kirdaaron ko trol kiye jane ko lekar kaha, ye isliye ho rahaa he ki kyonki is tarah kii filmon main mahilaon ko vaastivaktaa ke saath pesh kiya gaya he or ise samaaj ko apnaane main abhi vakt lagegaa
 Syed Salahuddin, chief of the terrorist organization Hizbul Mujahideen, has been declared an international terrorist by the US
 suraksha ke jaankaar kehete hai ki iskaa jammu-kashmir main aatanki harkaton par koi asar nahin padegaa lekin pakistan par dabaav jarur badhegaa
 On the other hand, Pakistan has said without consulting Salahuddin that those fighting for the rights of Kashmiris cannot be called terrorists
 vaise salahuddin jammu-kashmir main saikadon aatanki vaardaaton kaa mujrim he
 For years, this person playing the game of terror raised the Hizbul Mujahideen
 lekin ab itane baras baad america ne thik pradhanmantri or trump kii mulaakaat se pehle salahuddin ko antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit kar apana sandesh de diya he
 It will not be of much benefit, but it is more than indicative
 kendriya grih sachiv rajeev maharishi ne kaha ki ye bahut acchhee baat he
 This will prevent its movement and funding
 vaise vah darpok aadmi he jo bhaaga phirata he
 However, experts say that the declaration of Salahuddin as a terrorist will not make much difference in Jammu and Kashmir
 isaki vajah yah he ki amunan kashmir main karrwai karte vakt aatanki salahuddin se sidhe aadesh nahin lete hai balki apane jila commander se aadesh lekar karrwai ko anjaam dete hai
 The comments kendriya grih rajyamantri hansraj ahir ne enditivi india se kaha ki isse pakistan par dawaab badhegaa
 He will bow down and expose to the world that he is still running the factory of terror
 udhar pakistan salahuddin ke bachaav main utar aayaa he
 The Pakistan Foreign Ministry has issued a statement saying that those fighting for the rights of Kashmiris cannot be called terrorists
 salahuddin ke pehle hafiz said or zakiurrahman lakhvi bhi antarrashtriya aatankwaadiyon main hai
 So even if Salahuddin is included in such a list, the ground situation may not change, but the pressure on Pakistan will increase and it will probably affect Salahuddin's movement and money
 udhar pakistan ne salahuddin kaa naam liye bagaiyr kaha he ki kashmiriyon ke haq ke liye ladane waalon ko aatanki nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 Salahuddin is the perpetrator of hundreds of terrorist incidents in Jammu and Kashmir
 barason se aatank kaa khel khel rahe is shaks ne hizbul mujahidin ko khadaa kiya
 But now after so many years, America has given its message by declaring Salahuddin as an international terrorist just before the meeting of Prime Minister and Trump
 isse khaas phayda to nahin hoga lekin yah sankethik kahin zyada he
 Union Home Secretary Rajiv Maharishi said that this is a very good thing
 isse uske movement or funding par roak lagegi
 By the way, he is a sneaky man who runs away
 haalanki jaankaron kaa kahana he ki salahuddin ko aatanki ghoshit kiye jane se jammu-kashmir main bahut fark nahin aayega
 The reason for this is that while taking action in Kashmir, the terrorists do not take orders directly from Salahuddin, but instead take orders from their district commander and execute the action
 tippaniyan Union Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir told NDTV India that this would increase pressure on Pakistan
 wo jhukegaa or duniya ke saamne benakaab hoga ki abhi bhi aatank ke kaarkaane chalaa rahaa he
 On the other hand, Pakistan has come to the rescue of Salahuddin
 paak videsh mantralay ne bayaan jari kar kaha he ki kashmiriyon ke haq main ladane waalon ko aatanki nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Hafiz Saeed and Zakiurrahman Lakhvi were also among the international terrorists before Salahuddin
 isliye salahuddin ke bhi aisi list main aa jane se jamini halaat bhale na badalen, magar pakistan par dabaav badhegaa or shaayad salahuddin kii awajahi or paise jutaney par asar padegaa

 Social activist Anna Hazare has ignited the hope that the 'flame' is burning in the heart of every Indian against corruption, at least after seeing the sight of India Gate and Tihar Jail
 loktantr ke is utsav main bachche, buudhe, noujvaan, chaatr-chatraayen sabhi josh se bhare hue the
 Alam was that no one was seeing what the other was doing, people in groups of four and five were singing patriotic songs in their own tune
 jail ke baahar mangalvaar raat se hi kuch log jameen par baithe the to kuch thakkar so gaye the, lekin paas main hi ek jagah pighali hui mombattiyon kaa mom padaa tha jo raat kii kahani bayaan kar rahaa tha
 People were seen outside Tihar Jail, there was a tricolor in their hands and they were constantly chanting 'stop corruption' and 'vandematram'
 ek binar par to likhaa tha
 'that which is not Anna is sugarcane
 ' logon ne kaha ki yah josh mahaj do-chaar dinon kaa nahin he or jab tak anna hajaare ke saath har bhartiya kaa makasad puraa nahin ho jaataa tab tak unke saath ham yah ladaai ladate rahenge
 There were a large number of people who had come to join Anna Hazare's campaign by taking leave from office or leaving their homework
 tihaad jail ke baahar ek mahila se mulaakaat hui jo ghar se khaanaa or pani laai thi or use logon main baant rahi thi
 This woman said, 'I am giving food to people
 kuch log khaane se inkaar kar rahe hai kyonki unka kahana he ki jab tak anna hajaare bhukhe hai tab tak ham kaise kha sakate hai
 Outside Tihar, 21-year-old Sanjay Sharma, dressed in Mahatma Gandhi's costume, had his eyes on everyone
 main bhi apane ko roak nahin paaya
 Just went to talk to them
 unhone bataaya ki vah photographer hai
 He said that when he talked about going to Tihar, the family called him 'mad' but he came here without caring for anyone
 sharma jhuggi-jhopadi main rahete hai or unhen is baat kaa dukh he ki unke jaise logon ke liye desh main kuch nahin hota
 He said, 'mlas come and go after asking for votes
 pichley saal matadaata pahchaan patr banavaane ke liye maine 500 rupee die the
 'it was a view outside the Tihar Jail but i was stunned to see the view of India Gate around four o'clock in the evening
 india get par maujuud log sarkaar, khaastaur par kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal se kaaphi naaraaz dikhaai de rahe the
 Slogans were also raised against Congress President Sonia Gandhi at some places
 gudgaanv se apane puure parivaar ke saath ain nisha razdan ne kaha, 'log yahaan apana ghar-baar chhodkar isliye aae hai kyonki log bhrashtachar se pak chuke hai
 Water is flowing over the head
 yahaan hamaari sunne vaala koi nahin he
 People are sold in every department
 bina paise die koi kaam nahin hota
 Everyone from peons to officers eat money
 in logon ne itnaa pareshaan kar rakhaa he ki ab bardaasht kii seemaa khatm ho chuki he
 'when i reached home in the evening after spending the day at India Gate and Tihar Jail, i was quite tired
 man main kaaphi sari baaten chal raheen thi
 There is also a fear that Anna Hazare's movement will reach its end
 tabhi achaanak tivi par lalu ji prakat ho gaye
 a glimpse of the proceedings of Parliament was shown on a news channel
 lalu ji ne kaha, 'main anna hajaare kii bahut izzat karata hum
 Are good men
 baapu or jaiprakash narayan kii raah par chal rahe hai lekin main sansad main kahana chahta hum ki desh main baapu, jepi or acharya narendra dev kaa sthaan koi nahin le saktaa
 Yes, you can definitely copy them
 'lalu ji kii is baat main koi andeh nahin ki desh main jo sthaan 'baapu' or 'jepi' ko mila vah shaayad anna hajaare ko nahin mil saktaa lekin kya unhen is baat kaa ehsaas he ki unhen anna hajaare kii gandhi or jepi kii tulana ko lekar aisi baat kehane kii aavashyaktaa kyon padi?kya lalu ji yah bataa sakate hai ki desh main tamaam raajnneetik hastiyon ke hone ke baavjood anna hajaare ko hi log 'desh kaa doosraa gandhi' kyon bataa rahe hai
 Can he tell the name of any such leader today, on whose instructions the whole country took to the streets like this
 shaayad iskaa jawaab lalu ji ke paas bhi nahin hoga
 Today's leaders need to introspect and introspect, otherwise perhaps every youth of the country will say the same like me
 maaf kiijie lalu ji hamaare gandhi or jepi to anna hajaare hi hai
 In the Bhagalpur creation scam, the highest amount of government money has been in the land acquisition case
 srijan kis tarah se sarkaar ban kar kisaanon ko jameen kaa muaavja apane khate se detii thi, iskaa udhaaharan bhagalpur ke pirpanti main ban rahe power plant ke liye kiye gaye jameen ke adhigrahan se mil saktaa he
 Here, the government did not give compensation money to the farmers, but the institution called Srishna and that too was not given
 kisaanon ko nahin mila muaavjabhagalpurke pirpanti main bihar sarkaar ko power plant ke liye jameen adhigrahan 2013-15 main karana tha
 About 500 acres of land is to be acquired, but so far only 60 per cent of the land has been acquired
 bataaya jaataa he ki srijan kii vajah se hi puri jameen adhigrahit nahin ho pai
 But till now, the farmers have not received the full amount of land that the government has acquired
 kisaanon ko srijan ke khate se mila paisakuch kisaanon kaa 30-30 karod rupaya bakaayaa he
 Some farmers have received money not from the government account but from the creation account, while according to the rules, the government gives the money of the land acquired by the government, but the money reached the farmers from the account of creation here
 srijan mahila vikaas samiti ne bhu arjan vibhaag ke saath milakar kisaanon ko bhi chuunaa lagaaya
 Did not get full compensation 'aaj Tak' met a farmer of Pirpanti named SK Razzaq
 jinaki jameen power plant ke liye sarkaar ne adhigrahit kii he
 The compensation received in return was not from the Government account but from the account of creation
 rajjak ke teen bete hai, teenon ko pehali kist main 60-60 lakh, duusari kist main 19-19 lakh teenon bhaaiyon ko milanaa tha, lekin do bhaaiyon ko muaavja mila or tisare ko abhi tak muaavja nahin mila
 Half of the farmers received compensation: 840 farmers' land was acquired by the government for the power plant at Bhagalpur Pirpainti, but compensation was paid not to the government account but to the farmers
 abhi tak pachaas pratishat kisaanon ko hi muaavja diya gaya he, wo bhi 70 se 80 fisadi raashi hi di gai he
 Signed on the blank check is Munna Singh, a farmer whose story is more surprising
 unhone bataaya ki blank check par sin karaayaa gaya or us samay ke bhoomi adhikari rajeev ranjan ne unase kaha ki abhi paisa sarkaar ke khate main nahin he
 You will get when you come
 bhoomi adhigrahan ke badale sarkaar ko paisa dena chahie, lekin ulte kisaan se hi check le liya gaya
 He owes two crore rupees
 faraar he bhu arjan adhikarikisanonko jameen kaa muaavja dilaane ke liye andolan kar rahe dilip mishra ne bataaya ki yahaan zyaadaatar kisaanon ko srijan ke khate se aadha-adhuraa bhugtan kiya gaya he
 Land Acquisition Officer Rajiv Ranjan was posted in Bhagalpur for the past several years
 philhal is ghotaale main un par exiaar darj he or wo faraar hai
 But it is certain that Rajiv Ranjan is fully aware of the matter because the scam was also revealed by the check bounce of the Land Acquisition Department
 kahaan gai kisaanon kii muaavja raashi?srijan ke is karname ko dekh kar kisaan hairaan or pareshaan hai
 Farmers say that Kisrajan has executed this scam in association with land acquisition officials
 jameen adhigrahan ke paanch saal biit jane ke baad bhi abhi tak kai kisaanon ko muaavja nahin mila he
 The creation of farmers' money has been invested in their private trade
 kisaanon kaa ye bhi kahana he ki bhu arjan vibhaag sade kaagaj par sin le letaa tha or kahata tha ki aapke acount main muaavje kii raashi pahunch jaaegi
 Four months later some farmers got money, but they did not get the full amount
 vahiin jameen adhigrahan ke paanch saal biit jane ke baad bhi kuch kisaanon ke paise abhi tak nahin aae hai
 The Indian hockey team, who have displayed a lot of aggressive aggression in the last two matches, were completely overwhelmed by the World Champion Australia and after a humiliating 0-8 defeat in a one-sided match, they were awarded a silver medal in the Commonwealth Games
 Had to be content
 bharat kii yah sabase sharmnaak haar main se ek he
 This is India's first medal in men's hockey event in the history of Commonwealth Games

 On the other hand, Rick Charlesworth's Australian team won the fourth consecutive gold medal at the Commonwealth Games and re-established their reign in world hockey
 ek hi saal main vishwa cap, champiens trophy or rashtramandal khelon main swarna padak jeetne vaali vah pehali team ban gai

 pehle hi minute se aakraamak khel dikhaane vaali austrailian team ne bhartiya gol par lagaataar hamale bole
 At the same time, the Indian team, playing in the presence of many distinguished guests including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, could not show the enthusiasm, passion and aggression that they had shown against Pakistan and England

 austrailia ke haathon is maidan par bharat kii yah lagaataar teesri haar he
 Earlier in the Pool Cup in the World Cup held in February March, Australia defeated them by a margin of 5-2
 in khelon main bhi pool charan main yahi kahani doharaai gai
 Nielsen got a golden opportunity to score in the fifth minute for Australia but his shot went out
 bharat ko 15wein minute main pehla penlti carnor mila jis par sarvanajit kii push bhartiya draig flikar trep hi nahin kar sake
 Two minutes later, Australia attacked the Indian goal

 Australia got two consecutive penalty corners
 tisare penlti carnor ko behad aasaani se sirielo ne gol main badal diya
 Nielsen tripled Australia's lead in the 28th minute and scattered easy goals to the Indian defense
 brake se ek minute pehle dornar ne penlti carnor ko tabdeel karke austrailia kii badhat 4-0 kii kar di
 In the second half also, Australia did not let the Indians get out of the pressure
 austrailia ke liye 51wein minute main doran ne penlti carnor ko tabdeel kiya
 India also got a penalty corner in the 58th minute but Sandeep Singh's shot was weak
 austrailia ne iske baad bhi golon kii barish karnaa jari rakhaa
 Orchard scored a sixth goal for Australia in the 60th minute by making a dent in the Indian defense
 iske baad apana 250waan antarrashtriya match khel rahe dwayer ne 67wein minute main gol daaga
 In the second, Turner scored another goal to seal Australia's 8–0 victory

 aap bhi dekhie ye video It is a difficult task to know the mood of the people in a democracy
 sabhi kii chahat alag hoti he, sabhi kii soch alag hoti he
 Obviously, on which issues people will vote in the election and which party will vote, it is not easy to answer such questions
 lekin ye bhi sach he ki chunaav se pehle ab logon ne apana man to bana hi liya he or isiilie ajtak-india today-mail today-oarji ne survey kiya
 In the 15% assembly constituencies of the four states, the minds of the people have been explored
 18 march se lekar 24 march tak survey kiya gaya
 This opinion poll was conducted on 4000 people in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal
 jabaki, assam or kerala main 3000 log survey main shaamil kiye gaye
 The survey has received equal attention in both urban and rural areas
 is sample main mili rujhaan ke aadhaar par hi siton ke aankadon ko pesh kiya gaya he
 It is estimated that there may be a difference of three per cent in this trend
 pashchim bengal, wo rajya jahaan left or mamata kii izzat daanv par lagi he
 According to the trends received from Opinion poll, this time it will be that which has not happened in the last 34 years, Opinion poll says that Mamata's Trinamool government will be formed with the help of Congress
 ajtak-india today-mail today-oarji opinian pole ne jab pashchim bengal ke logon se unka mood poocha to sanket mili ki vahaan sarkaar kaa rang badalegaa
 Bengal has 294 seats and according to the survey, the Trinamool and Congress alliance is getting 182 seats there
 left front ko sirf 101 siten mil rahi hai or is tarah se tiemasi-congress gathbandhan bahumat ke aankade 148 se kaaphi aage dikh rahaa he
 In the last assembly election, TMC won 33 seats and Congress 26 seats, while this time the alliance of both is expected to gain tremendous seats
 iske thik ulat pichley chunaav main 236 siton par kabja jamaane vaale left front ko is baar siton kaa baari nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 The people of Bengal were asked who you want to see as the Chief Minister, the maximum at 48
 6 fisadi logon ne mamata banerjee kaa naam liya, jabaki buddhadeb bhattacharya ko kareeb 20 fisadi logon ne pasand kiya
 Five and a half percent of the state wants to make Pranab Mukherjee the chief minister
 aakhir bengal main chunaav ke mudde kya honge
 92 according to the survey
 6 fisadi log sabase bada mudda maanate hai, jabaki 5 fisadi se kam logon kaa kahana he ki mahangaai koi mudda nahin he
 Similarly, on the question of corruption, about 84 percent people said that yes, it is an issue, while 11
 7 fisadi log isse sahamat nahin dikhe
 Electricity, water, roads are considered by 81 per cent of Bengal as electoral issues, while 16
 3 fisadi log isse ittfa nahin rakhte
 Likewise 83 of the state
 2 fisadi logon ne berogari ko mudda mana he or 13 fisadi ne kaha he ki nahin, berogari koi mudda nahin he
 Now, if we talk about the changing air in West Bengal, there will be no significant change in the percentage of votes
 balki 2009 kii tulana main mamata kii party ko ek fisadi kaa nuksaan hi hoga
 But Mamta is ahead in the estimate of seats
 survey main logon se jyoti basu or buddhadeb bhattacharya kii tulana karte hue sawaal puche gaye
 It was asked who the people would remember as the better Chief Minister
 bataur rail mantri mamata banerjee kaa kaam log kis rup main dekhte hai, survey main ek sawaal ye bhi tha
 People were asked in the survey that if Mamata Banerjee becomes the Chief Minister of West Bengal, then how will she prove to be the Chief Minister? Some criticize the policies of the Left, saying that because of this Kolkata has lagged behind other metro cities
 survey main logon se poocha gaya ki ve isse sahamat hai yaa nahin? trinmul ke virdohi usapar naksaliyon se sathganth kaa aarope lagaate hai
 It was asked in the survey whether this thing benefits TMC or it hurts them

 In this context, the CAG has also asked for an in-depth scrutiny of the 10 contracts awarded by Reliance Industries
 isamen se aath theke ankar samooh ko die gaye hai
 The same group had bid for these contracts
 kaig ne reliance ko keji di6 kshetra main huye baari kharch ke maamle main kuch raahat dete huye kaha he ki keval pariyojna kii anumaanit laagat ko manjuuri dena hi pariyojna kii laagat ko sweekaar kar lenaa nahin he, vaastavik vyay kii lekhapariksha ke baad isaki sahi tasviir saamne aa sakati he
 The CAG stated that Reliance had submitted an initial development plan in May 2004 for the development of Dhirubhai 1 and Dhirubhai 3 areas, including 2
 4 arab dollars kaa puunji vyay anumaanit tha
 Subsequently, in October 2006, the company launched the first phase 5

 Proposed an additional capital expenditure of $ 6 billion
 report main kaha gaya, ‘shuruaati vikaas yojana ke tahat zyaadaatar kharidari aakhri samay main kii gai, jabaki atirikt vyay yojana ke hisaab se kharidari use sarkaar ke paas jamaa karaane se pehle hi shuru kar di gai thi, is hisaab se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki kshetra kii sanchaalak company ne shuruaati yojana ke anuroop nahin balki baad main bade kharch kii yojana ke anuroop vikaas kaary kii shuruyaat kii thi
 According to the CAG report, the expenditure incurred in KG basin area in 2006-07 and 2007-08 has been audited, but the rest of the expenditure in 2008-09 will be audited in the coming time

 Of these, eight contracts have been awarded to anchor group companies
 ‘ham na keval iskaa suzav dete rahe hai ki kshetra kii sanchaalak company ko sarkari kharid prakriya ko apnaanaa chaiye balki koi bhi vanijyik vasuuli athwa adhigrahan pratispardhaa badhaane ke uddeshy se hi hona chaiye taaki acha pratispardhi mulya samil sake
 The report also emphasizes the review of PSC under the new oil exploration licensing policy (NELP) introduced in the year 1999
 isamen kaha gaya he ki bhaajapa ke netritv vaali rajg sarkaar ke samay taiyaar is niti main thekedaaron ko puunjigat kharch kam karne ke liye upyukt protsaahan nahin diye gayi hai
 Whereas in the policy, in the initial phase, contractors have been encouraged to spend more
 iskaa parinaam yah hota he ki kshetra se sarkaar ko hone vaali prapti kam rahati he
 The report said that "two independent agencies also reviewed the NELP PSC and came to the same result that the current process adversely affects the interest of government participation, so it is quite necessary to review the formula for the production participation contract" is
 ’kaig ne kaha he ki bhavishya main hone vaale utpaadan bhagidaari anubandh (piessi) ke maamle main kshetra main hone vaale nivesh or usamen hone vaali kai guna vruddhi ko munafa main hissedari se alag rakhaa janaa chaiye

 17200 complaints of pits were received in Mumbai
 BMC noted that only 3500 percussion was not received even on messaging
 Open pits in Mumbai have increased the problems of people
 pichley saal kii tarah is saal bhi taxperes kii gadhi kamai kuen main hi ja rahi he
 The reason is the irresponsible attitude of BMC (brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation)
 haalanki biemasi kaa daawa he ki wo mumbaikaron kii sadakon par pareshaani se mukt awajahi sunishchit karne ke liye koi kasar nahin chhod rahi he
 But at the ground level there is no significant change compared to last year
 mumbai or upnagaron main pichley kuch dinon se barish nahin ho rahi he, lekin phir bhi yahaan ke log jagah-jagah ubhar aae gaddhon se pareshaan hai
 Leader of the Opposition in BMC Ravi Raja has said in his tweet on the problem of people, “BMC has received 1578 complaints of pits in the last 30 days
 yah prashasan ke liye shame kii baat he
 But now BMC should study and analyze data
 saath hi pichley data se isaki tulana kerani chahie
 In such a situation, where the worst situation is created, they should be identified so that the people around there do not have to face trouble
 ”agar is saal 10 june se 1 agast ke bich uplabdh data kii baat kii jaae to adhiktar vaardon main 100 se adhik shikaayatein milin
 How many complaints from which ward, Ward-102 KE Ward-291, KW Ward-149 l Ward-123 PN Ward-158 PS Ward-132 RS Ward-109 s Ward-191 Official data shows that BMC has 89 out of the total complaints received
 23 fisadi kaa nistaaran kiya or sirf 10
 Only 77 percent of the complaints are pending
 aise main koi bhi hairaan ho saktaa he ki jab biemasi itani acchhee tarah kaam kar rahaa he to logon ko shahar main itane saare gaddhon se saamana kyon karnaa pad rahaa he
 In the year 2019, only 17200 pit complaints were reported in Mumbai
 inamen se biemasi ne sirf 3500 shikayaton kaa hi nistaaran kiya
 Did not even look at the rest
 yahi vajah he ki aaj log puch rahe hai ki is tathakthith antarrashtriya shahar main itane saare gadde kyon hai? congress netaa ravi raja ke mutabik iskaa ek hi kaaran he ki biemasi apana kaam thik se nahin kar rahaa
 The opposition alleges that BMC is one of the richest civic bodies in Asia
 ye har saal nai sadaken banane par 2000 karod rupee kharch karata he
 But even after spending so much money, the results are not visible on the ground according to the expected standards
 biemasi dwaara marammat karaae jane ke baavjood har saal monsoon main gadde ubhar aate hai
 India Today has come to know that BMC allocated around Rs 125 crore for the repair of the pits this year
 vipaksh kaa yah bhi aarope he ki do saal pehle ek company ko gadde bharne ke liye cold mix saamagree taiyaar karne kaa theka diya gaya tha
 This was clearly a bad move but it continued nonetheless
 is tarah kaa kadam aapadaa ke rup main saamne aayaa
 Because in the first rains these cold mix materials got washed away
 phir bhi isi tareeke ko jari rakhaa ja rahaa he jo naakaam ho chukaa he
 The opposition leader alleges that somewhere it seems that BMC is trying to benefit cold mix contractors
 shahar ke kai hisson main biemasi abhi bhi gaddhon ko bharne ke liye pevar block kaa upyog kar rahi he
 Which, once uprooted, prove to be a disaster for bike riders on the roads
 jab ajtak ne is sambandh main jaankaree lee to bataaya gaya ki teen saal pehle nagar ayukta dwaara sadakon par pevar block kaa istemaal nahin karne kaa aadesh diya gaya tha
 Apparently that order is not being followed and the impact of the uprooting of paver blocks can be seen in many parts of the city
 halaat kitne vikat hai, yah isi se samajha ja saktaa he ki mumbaikaron ne ab khud hi gadde bharne kaa jimmaa sambhala he
 Mushtaq Ansari and Irfan Machiwala, who run an NGO known as Pothole Warriors, have done about 343 potholes since last year
 donon kaa daawa he ki is saal akele unhone shahar ke kai hisson main 39 gadde bhare hai
 The mixture used by BMC is adulterated and is mixed with concrete gravel
 ye gaddhon main jam nahin paati
 This work is not monitored by engineers
 biemasi adhikariyon se jab is sambandh main unka paksh jaanane kii koshish kii gai, to kai baar massej or kol karne ke baad bhi koi jawaab nahin mila

 Recalling the early havoc of Dale Steyn (three for 18) after Deccan Chargers were invited to bat, an 82-run partnership for the fourth wicket between Rohit (51) and Monish Mishra (41) helped them to six wickets Made a respectable score of 151 runs
 royal chalangers kii naiya hichkole khaati rahi
 In the middle, Rahul Dravid (49) and Jacques Kallis gave him some support while Robin Uthappa (34 runs off 20 balls) woke him up but the pain of losing four wickets in the middle of 18 balls continued to haunt him
 And finally Anil Kumble's Team 19
 4 over main 138 ran par dher hokar agar magar ke bhavar main funs gayi
 Deccan thus have 12 points in 12 matches and despite finishing the run rate, they are still in the race for the last four after finishing at number five
 royal chalangers ke bhi 12 match main itane hi ank hai lekin behatar ran gati ke aadhaar par vah duusare sthaan par he
 The match was highly fluctuating and sometimes the pan would be bent to the other side but in the end, two wickets of RP Singh, Pragyan Ojha, Harmeep Singh and Ryan Harris proved to be decisive
 haris ne manish pandey ko pari kii pehali gend par out kiya
 Kallis and Dravid then shared a 74-run partnership for the second wicket
 isamen dravid kaa yogadan ahm rahaa jinke out hone se yah saajhedaari tuuti
 Dravid then sent the ball across the boundary line to keep the score board running and hit eight fours in his innings before catching a catch on Andrew Symonds' flight
 kallis kaaphi dhime khel rahe the jisase dravid ke saath unki saajhedaari main 62 gend kharch ho gayi
 When Kallis reached the dugout, caught by b Sumanath off Ojha, he had 27 runs in 37 balls and only one four in front of his name
 uthppa ne symonds ke agle over main midwicket par pehla chakka lagaaya lekin duusare chor se wicket girane se un par dabaav ban gaya
 Ojha, who wore a purple cap with the highest 18 wickets in the tournament, also got Virat Kohli caught by Sumanath after Kallis, while RP Singh brought the beautiful Yarker to fizzle for Ross Taylor's wickets
 unhone apane agle over main camerun white ko bhi rukhsat kar diya
 Harris meanwhile conceded 21 runs in the 18th over, including Uthappa's two sixes

 ab aadhaar card hone par bhartiya rail se yatra karnaa aasaan ho jayega
 IRCTC has given the freedom to book 12 tickets within 1 month on Aadhaar verification for booking railway tickets
 khaas baat yah he ki railway kii tikat book karaane ke liye aadhaar ko anivaary nahin kiya gaya he
 On the basis of Aadhaar verification, the limit of existing 6 tickets in online ticket booking has been reduced to 12 tickets for every month
 IRCTC ne online tikat booking kii apni guideline badal di hai or is maheene sekhishchhthchh kii portelpar aadhaar number ko aplod karne kii suvidha di gai he 
 In this, after the Aadhaar verification on each account for every month, the existing limit of 6 tickets has been increased to 12 tickets
 is limit main iarsitisi kii website par kisi acount main book karaae gaye tikat ke saath-saath rail conect mobile aplicoshan ap ke jariye book karaae gaye tikat ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 According to official railway sources, Aadhaar card has not been made mandatory for online tickets
 bina aadhaar card kii information die online tikat booking main har ek vyakti ek maheene main chhath tikat book kara saktaa he
 If you want to book more than 6 tickets in a month, then you will have to verify the Aadhaar card of the passenger
 iarsitisi kii website par koi bhi yatri maay profile category main aadhaar kevaisi par clic karke apane aadhaar number ko apadet kar saktaa he
 During this verification, a one-time password is sent to the mobile number linked to Aadhaar
 is password ko website par daalane par aadhaar card kaa veriphication ho jaataa he
 Let me tell you that the attempt to make Aadhaar card compulsory in the Senior Citizen Concession had failed in the past
 pichley saal disambar main railway ne rail tikat par senior citigen ke liye riyaayat hasil karne ke vaaste aadhaar card kaa registration jaruri kiye jane kaa elaan kiya tha
 This was stopped after protests by the people and due to technical flaws

 jitiya vrath kaa hindu dharm main bada mahatv he
 Lord Jeevatavahana is helpful in removing all the problems faced by the son
 manyata he ki ise karne se putr prapti bhi hoti he
 Let us tell you in detail about the story of this fast and its importance
 jitiya vrath kii kathanarmada nadi ke paas kanchanabati naam kaa nagar tha
 The king there was Malayaketu
 narmada nadi ke pashchim disha main marubhumi thi, jise baluhata kaha jaataa tha
 There was a huge Pakar tree
 us par chil rahati thi
 Under the tree was Khodhar, in which Siyarin lived
 chil or siaarin, donon main dosti thi
 Once both of them resolved to do Jitiya fast
 phir donon ne bhagwaan jiutvahan kii puja ke liye nirjala vrath rakhaa
 On the day of the fast, the great businessman of that city died
 ab uskaa dah sanskaar usee marusthal par kiya gaya
 It was a dark night and it started pouring heavily
 kabhi bijli kadakati to kabhi badal garajte
 The storm had come
 siaarin ko ab bhukh lagane lagi thi
 Seeing the dead, she could not stop herself and her fast was broken
 par chil ne sanyam rakhaa or niyam va shraddha se agle din vrath kaa paaran kiyaphir agle janm main donon saheliyon ne brahman parivaar main putree ke rup main janm liya
 His father's name was Bhaskar
 chil, badi bahan bani or uskaa naam shilvati rakhaa gaya
 Sheelvati is married to Budhisen
 siyaaran, choti bahan ke rup main janmi or uskaa naam kapuravati rakhaa gaya
 He was married to King Malayeketu of that city
 ab kapuravati kanchanabati nagar kii rani ban gai
 With the blessings of Lord Jiutavahana, Sheelwati had seven sons
 par kapuravati ke sabhi bachche janm lete hi mar jate the
 After some time, the seven sons of Shilwati grew up
 ve sabhi raja ke darbar main kaam karne lage
 Kapuravati had a feeling of envy on seeing her
 usne raja se kahkar sabhi beton ke sar kaat die
 He ordered seven new utensils and placed them in it and covered it with red cloth and sent it to Shilwati
 yah dekh bhagwaan jiutvahan ne mitti se saaton bhaaiyon ke sar banaae or sabhi ke sir ko uske dhad se jodakar un par amrit chhidak diya
 This brought them to life
 saaton yuvak jinda ho gaye or ghar laut aae
 The severed Sir Rani sent them became fruit
 duusari ore rani kapuravati, buddhisen ke ghar se soochna paane ko vyakul thi
 When information did not come for long, Kapuravati herself went to her elder sister's house
 vahaan sabko jinda dekhakar vah sann rah gayi
 When he regained consciousness, he told the sister everything
 ab use apni galati par pachhtaawaa ho rahaa tha
 By the grace of Lord Jiutavahana, Sheelwati remembered the things of her previous birth
 vah kapuravati ko lekar usee pakad ke ped ke paas gayi or use sari baaten bataayin
 Kapuravati fainted and died
 jab raja ko isaki khabar mili to unhone usee jagah par jaakar pakad ke ped ke neeche kapuravati kaa dah-sanskaar kar diya

 This is his politics
 baalion ke khilaaf sabhi jhuthe aarope hai
 a few days ago, the police called Naresh Balyan, an AAP candidate from Uttam Nagar, in connection with getting a large number of liquor bottles
 'aap' netaa ashutosh ne daawa kiya, maine police ayukta ko yah bataane ke liye kal raat unhen phone kiya tha ki police bijepi ke dabaav main hamaare pratyaashiyon par dabaav daal rahi he or unka utpeedan kar rahi he
 They did not pick up my phone
 main unhen dabaav main nahin aane kaa anurodh karne ke liye milane kii koshish karuunga
 He said, there is no case against Balian
 koi exiaar darj nahin hui he or unhen aadhi raat ko ek notice jari kiya gaya
 This shows that this is a conspiracy to discredit 'AAP'
 ashutosh ne aaj tadake twit karke kaha ki unke paas is baat kii soochna he ki police adhikari unki party ke khilaaf karrwai karne ke liye dabaav main hai or vah chunaav ayog ke adhikariyon se milakar unhen halaat kii jaankaree denge
 Commissioner of Police BS Bassi denied the allegations, saying that the police had never been under any kind of pressure
 unhone kaha, keval kuch maamle hai or naresh baalion ke maamle ko chhodkar baaki vivaad chote-mote maamle hai
 When around 457 cans of liquor were found near Balian, we had evidence, so we summoned them for further investigation
 bassi ne kaha, ham kisi khaas dal ke ummidavaaron kaa utpeedan nahin karnaa chaahate, lekin ham yah bhi aashaa karte hai ki kanoon apana kaam kare

 The committee suggested freeing petrol and diesel prices from government control and a steep increase in the prices of LPG and kerosene
 petroleum mantralay ke ek adhikari ne kaha, ‘‘aaayaatit mulya se sasta eendhan bech paanaa ab sambhav nahin he
 If prices do not rise, the government will have to find a way to make up for the loss of Rs 72,300 crore due to selling petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene at less than the imported price
 ’’ is baat kii kaaphi had tak sambhaavna he ki petrol keemton ko niyantran mukt kar diya jaae
 The Finance Minister will probably also talk about deregulation of diesel prices
 dijal desh main sabase zyada istemaal hone vaala eendhan he or iskaa parivahan kshetra main istemaal hota he tathaa iskaa mudrasphithik asar bhi hota he
 The official said that the decision to deregulate diesel prices will depend to a large extent on Mamata Banerjee, the leader of Trinamool Congress, an ally of the government
 ‘‘yadi mamata raji ho jaati hai, to dijal kii keemton ko niyantran mukt kiya ja saktaa he
 "similarly, the increase in domestic LPG prices by up to Rs 50 per cylinder is being considered
 halanki, mamata or anya sahyogiyon kaa dabaav padane par yah badhotaree kam ho sakati he
 a slight increase in the prices of kerosene, which is considered politically sensitive, can also be proposed in the EGOM
 ijioem ko petrol ko niyantranmukt karne ke liye isaki keemton main 3
 35 per liter will have to be increased, while diesel prices to be deregulated
 49 rupee prati litre kii hogi
 The price of petrol in Delhi is currently 47

 The official said that till last week, 6 in petrol prices

 a hike of Rs 38 per liter was required
 keemton main itani badhotaree khaskar dijal ke daam ek baar main itane zyada badhanaa sarkaar ke liye raajnneetik drushti se mushkil hoga
 But the increase that is needed now is quite reasonable

 rajasthan main vasundhara raaje sarkaar dwaara laae gaye vivaadit ordinance par kanoon rajya mantri peepi choudhary se 'aaj tak' ne khaas baatcheet kii
 During the conversation, he was seen defending the ordinance
 unke mutabik adhyadesh bhrashtachariyon ko bachaane ke liye nahin balki eemaandaar adhikariyon ko tamaam pareshaaniyon se bachaane ke liye he
 On the ordinance brought by the Rajasthan government, Minister of State for Law PP Chaudhary said, "the ordinance that the Rajasthan government has brought is not to protect corrupt people
 yah eemaandaar logon ko bachaane ke liye he
 Be a magistrate, be a public servant
 jab koi jhuthe aarope lagate hai, FIR darj hoti he
 He has to go through bad times
 media trial ho jaati he
 It is later found that those allegations were false
 agar aise aarope lagaae jaaen jo thik nahin he
 If it is not good then they suffer a lot
 isliye aarope lagane ke baad jaanch jaruri he
 If it is found in the investigation that someone is guilty then action will be taken against him
 aarope koi bhi laga detaa he kisi ke khilaaf, inhen tamaam chizon ko dekhte hue ordinance laayaa gaya he
 "further clarifying his point, Chaudhary continued," This is not to save the corrupt people
 bhrasht logon ke liye isamen koi bhi gunjaaish nahin he
 only a matter of time
 kam se kam 1 fact finding inquayri honi chahie
 Anyone can go to court
 koi bhi FIR darj karvaa saktaa he
 No one is forbidden
 lekin usase pehle agar court police ko jaanch dene ke liye de de
 It should be ascertained in advance that the allegations against the public service have some merit
 kisi ne aarope jaanboojh kar to nahin laga diya
 These allegations have not been made to defame an officer
 "adhyadesh par congress ke virodhper choudhary ne kaha, "ordinance ko lekar shor machaana hallaa karnaa to congress kaa raajnneetik stant he
 Congress does any good work and stands against it
 yah unka kaam he
 This is a political stunt
 congress kaa isse koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Congress talks of corruption Congress always saved corrupt officer
 unka vijan ek taraf rahata he kibhrashtacharkaise kiya jaae or BJP kaa vijan rahata he ki vikaas kaise kiya jaae
 So it should not go on
 chunavi samay he
 Therefore, Congress is opposing this thinking
