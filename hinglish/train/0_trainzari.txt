 fasebuk in dinon data brich ko lekar surkhiyon main bana hua he
 Recently Facebook has introduced facial recognition feature
 fasebuk pehle bhi phase ricognishan feechar yuj karata he, lekin is baar ise duusari tarah se yuj karne kaa plan he
 This new feature of Facebook has been introduced so that people do not have identity problems
 iskaa doosraa makasad kisi yujar kii photo kaa galat istemaal na ho use sunishchit karnaa he
 For this, Facebook is resorting to face recognition
 fasebuk ke mutabik is feechar ke tahat fasebuk par agar koi yujar aapaki photo aplod karata he to phase ricognishan feechar ke jariye aapako ek notification milegaa
 In this notification, it will be told that the Facebook user has uploaded a photo in which you can be
 haal hi main maine is feechar ko apane fasebuk par on kiya tha, kaaphi dinon tak koi notification nahin mila
 Suddenly on 26 March some people uploaded the poster of Salman's upcoming film Race 3 and i started getting notifications
 chunki inamen se kisi ne mujhe un poster main tag nahin kiya tha or notification mujhe mila to ye hairaan karne vaala tha
 Because there was a user who is not even in my friend list
 is poster main salmaan khan or anil kapur sahit kuch or star hai
 But Facebook made a square near Salman Khan's photo and wanted to tell me that you can be in this photo
 isamen fasebuk ne teen opshan die – Not Me, Ignore or Tag yourself
 i chose the first option
 kuch der main notification aane band ho gaye
 This raises two questions - first, how Facebook performs face recognition and second, on which basis Facebook tags
 chunki fasebuk ne is feechar ke saath aipal ke phase idi kii tarah ye daawa nahin kiya he ki phase ricognishan 99
 9 percent would be correct
 aipal or isaki technology kaaphi alag he
 On the one hand, Apple uses face recognition by scanning your face and for this the company has given many dedicated sensors, on the other hand, Facebook scans and analyzes your photos to find out who you are through machine learning
 isamen chook hona badi baat nahin he
 But this raises questions on Facebook
 fasebuk setting main phase ricognishan feechar diya gaya he jise aap chahen to aneble yaa disable kar sakate hai
 Even with the introduction of this feature, Privacy Experts had raised the question that Facebook Face Recognition feature is dangerous in terms of privacy of users
 lekin fasebuk ne ek statement jari kiya jisamen kaha gaya ki phase ricognishan kaa data kisi bhi third party ko nahin diya jayega or ek tay samay main ise delit kar diya jayega
 How does Facebook's Face Recognition feature work? Facebook's technology analyzes pixels of photos and videos that include your profile photos, videos
 ainalise karke ek number nikaala jaataa he jise fasebuk template kahata he
 Facebook compares this template with other photos and videos, if both of them match, then you are identified
 lekin is ghatana se yah samaj main aata he ki abhi fasebuk kii yah technology kamjor he or isamen kaaphi khamiyaan hai jisase aam yujar ko samasya ho sakati he
 To my knowledge, i have never put Salman Khan's picture on my Facebook as a profile photo, nor am i a fan of him
 maine shahrukh khan kii tasviir ko profile photo main pehle lagaaya he or agar shahrukh khan kii photo main fasebuk phase ricognishan ke jariye mujhe tag karata to shaayad hairaani nahin hoti
 But one incident shows the flaw of Facebook's face recognition
 agar aisa rahaa to aane vaale samay main fasebuk yugers ke paas aise notification kii bharmaar ho sakati he jis photo main wo nahin honge unamem bhi fasebuk unhen tag karne ko kahegaa

 Basant Panchami is celebrated with great enthusiasm across the country
 basant panchami (basant Panchami) hindooon ke bade tyohaar main se ek he
 According to mythological beliefs, Saraswati, the goddess of learning, was born on this day
 basant panchami ke din devi saraswati kii puja kii jaati he
 Also Rituraj spring starts from this day
 aaj kaa din dilli par shashan karne vaale antim hindu shaasha prithviraj chouhan (prithviraj Chauhan) ke shaury or parakram ke liye bhi yaad kiya jaataa he
 Let us know that Prithviraj, famous as the last Hindu Raja, ascended the throne at the age of fifteen
 prithviraj kii teraa raniyaan thi
 On the day of Basant Panchami in 1192 AD, Prithviraj Chauhan killed his enemy Mohammed Ghori despite having no eyes
 prithviraj chouhan ne jis tarah mohammad gori kaa vadh kiya tha vah vakya bhi bada dilachasp or haroonges he
 According to historians, Prithviraj Chauhan and Mohammad Ghori fought twice in the field of Tarain
 pehle yuddh main gori ko munh kii khaani padi
 It is said that Prithviraj Chauhan was of a generous heart and he left Ghori alive despite being defeated in the war
 par duusari baar tarin ke maidan main jab yuddh hua tab gori jeet gaya or usne prithviraj ko nahin choda
 He took Prithviraj Chauhan with him to Afghanistan and burst his eyes there
 gori kaa pratishodh yahi shant nahin hua or usne unhen jaan se maarane kii thaan lee
 Basant Panchami 2019: Vasant Panchami's greetings to everyone with these special messages of Basant Panchami
 vah aawaaj sunakar tir chalaa sakate the
 Before giving the death penalty, Ghori wanted to see the brilliance of his wrenching arrow
 prithviraj ke saathi kavi chandbardaai ne gori ko oonche sthaan par baithkar tave par chot markar sanket karne kaa paraamarsh diya
 Ghori agreed and did exactly as Chandbardai said
 tabhi chandbardaai ne prithviraj ko sandesh diya:chaar bans choubees gaj, angul asht pramaan
 Ta is Sultan above, do not miss Chauhan
 How Saraswati Puja is performed on Basant Panchami? Prithviraj Chauhan understood the gesture of his dear friend Chandbardai and he did not forget even a little
 unhone tave par hui chot or chandbardaai ke sanket se anumaan laga liya ki gori kitni duuri or kis disha main baitha he
 Then what was the arrow that he hit, directly into Ghori's chest
 iske baad chandbardaai or prithviraj ne bhi ek duusare kaa vadh kar atmbalidaan de diya
 According to historians, this incident of 1192 AD also happened on the day of Basant Panchami

 The Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government and the Lieutenant Governor (LG) office have been at loggerheads over issues such as the transfer of bureaucrats, control of the anti-corruption branch and assault on the chief secretary, they have had major issues during the last three and a half years
 1
 Three months after the anti-corruption Branch (ACB) came into prominence, the AAP government said in May 2015 that it was not able to take strict action against corrupt officials due to the control of ACB being given to Lt Governor (then) Najeeb Jung
 aap sarkaar ne aarope lagaaya ki aisa purvavarti shila dikshit (congress) nit shashan ke dauraan nahin tha, isane kaha ki centre ne 2014 main dilli main raashtrapati shashan lage rahane ke dauraan ek adhisuchana jari kar asibi kaa niyantran uparajyapal ke haathon main de diya

 Angered by lg's move, the AAP government had locked the office of the then Principal Secretary (services) Anindo Majumdar
 darasal, majumdaar ne alji ke nirdesh ke baad gamelin kii niyukti kaa aadesh diya tha
 This was the first major altercation between the AAP government and the LG office on this issue, since then Kejriwal has often complained that he is not able to appoint a peon, nor can he transfer any officer of his government
 unhone isaki vajah yah bataai ki centre ne dilli sarkaar kii shaktiyaan chin lee he or use alji ko saunp diya he
 He also alleged that the bureaucrats are not following the orders of their government as their cadre controlling authority is the Union Home Ministry
 disambar 2015 main, dilli ke naukarshah ek din ke samuhik avkaash par chale gaye
 The officials took this step in protest against the AAP government's decision to suspend two special home secretaries

 unhone alji par aarope lagaaya ki vah samooche shahar main 1

 Election Results: whose head will crown Taj? Election results of 5 states today mumbai cricket sangh ke adhyaksh sharad pavaar ne ek aisa khulaasa kiya jo vaaki bahut adbhut he
 According to this, Sachin Tendulkar gave the Indian team a charismatic tilism, which is unmatched worldwide
 sharad pavaar ne kaha he ki vah sachin tendulkar hi the, jinhone captain ke taur par mahendra singh dhoni ke naam kaa suzav diya tha
 In 2007, Rahul Dravid had expressed his desire to relinquish the captaincy and after that Sachin asked Dhoni to hand over this responsibility
 pavaar ne apane blog main likhaa he, 'sachin ko apane saathi khilaadiyon visheshkar junior cricketron kii madad karnaa acha lagata he or vah team bhaavana main vishwaas karte hai
 Humility is his middle name
 unhone apane khel par dhyaan dene ke liye captaini chhod di thi
 'he has written,' Now a story that will please countless fans of Sachin Tendulkar and Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 yah kuch saal pehle kii baat he jab bhartiya team england main khel rahi thi
 i was also in London being the BCCI chief
 'kendriya krishi mantri sharad pavaar ne kaha, 'ek din rahul dravid mere paas aaye or unhone apane aagrah se mujhe hairat main daal diya
 Dravid said that he wanted to give up the captaincy as it was affecting his game
 meraa sidhaa jawaab diya nahin
 The Twenty20 series is scheduled to begin soon and the World Cup is to be held after only one year
 'unhone kaha, ‘dravid aise mahatvapurn mode par captaini chhodane ke bare main kaise soch saktaa tha
 Who will be his successor? Dravid stood by his decision
 unhone agle captain ke liye sachin ke naam kaa suzav diya
 i spoke to Sachin on the subject on this
 vah dravid kii jagah captain banane ke icchhuk nahin the
 He suggested Dhoni's name
 isse kahani main nayaa mode aa gaya
 Pawar recalled, "dhoni is an excellent wicketkeeper but will he prove to be a good captain?" sachin ne jawaab diya, ‘aap use aajamaao
 He will prove to be a very good captain
 main jimmedaari ke ahsaas ke saath yah kah rahaa hum
 'he said,' After this, the BCCI selection committee selected Dhoni as the captain of the team and he made India proud
 hamane tii20 vishwa cap jeeta or baad main mumbai main 2011 main ekadivasiy vishwa cap bhi jeeta
 The new captain was highly praised for what he deserved
 yah sachin kii duuradrushtita ke kaaran sambhav ho paaya
 Pawar said, "sachin is about to retire now, but he cannot keep himself away from cricket for long
" mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki sanyas lene ke baad yuva khilaadiyon ko gur sikhaanaa unki yojanaon main shaamil hoga

 Implement Om Prakash Rajbhar's attack on Yogi government in 72 hours OBC Reservation - The Rajbhar Allahabad High Court has stayed the government's decision to include 17 extremely backward castes among the Dalits and also asked the government to reply on this issue in 3 weeks
 
 yogi sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad ati pichhadi jatiyon main khushi kaa maahaul tha lekin jaise hi elahabaad hoicourt ne sarkaar ke is aadesh ko khaarij kiya uske baad is par siyasat shuru ho gai he
 Omprakash Rajbhar, who was once involved in the Yogi cabinet, attacked the state government and said that at first the government took a reservation order to show it and now it has its own man standing and canceled it in the High Court
 omprakash rajbhar ne chunauti dete hue kaha he ki jis tareeke se saamaanya varg ke aarakshan ko ek jatke main lagu kiya gaya usee tareeke se rajya sarkaar in jatiyon ko 72 ghante main dalit category main shaamil karaae nahin to mana jayega ki yah jumalibaj sarkaar kii ek chaal he
 On the other hand, the Nishad Party, which came with the NDA before the elections, is also shocked by this decision of the court
 mallaah, bind, rajbhar, kevat, kashyap jaisi jatiyaan bahut pehle se dalit category kii maang kar rahi thim
 The Nishad Party was the leader of this movement
 nishad party is samay endie ke saath he or ab is mudde par jald sarkaar se kadam uthaane kii maang kar rahi he
 National President of Nishad Party Sanjay Nishad said that the court has been misled on this matter
 unhone kaha ki 17 pichhadi jatiyaan 1961 se raashtrapati ke notification ke hisaab se anusuchit jati main hai, manjowaar kii paryaayavachi kevat / mallaah he
 The synonym of the craftsman is the potter / creator
 sanjay nishad ne kaha ki kuch log court or sarkaar ko gumraah kar rahe hai
 Yogi government minister Siddharth Nath Singh said that even when we gave these 17 castes the same reservation benefits as Dalit castes, even then the High Court order was accepted and will still obey the court order
 bataa den ki mallaah, bind, kevat, kashyap prajapati, bhar, rajbhar, lohaar sareekhee kai ati pichhadi jatiyaan upi main pichhadi jatiyon main he jabaki aisi hi jatiyaan kai rajyon main daliton main hai
 On this basis, the court had earlier given the green signal to include them in the depressed class
 baad main vartmaan dalit jatiyon kii ore se iskaa virodh kiye jane or kuch logon ke dwaara court main maamla le jaae jane ke baad elahabaad hoicourt ne is aadesh par roak laga di he

 There first came the news that the independent mlas would come together with the BJP and form the BJP government, but Gopal Kanda also had a name in the list of Independent mlas who are facing trial in several criminal cases
 isaki jaankaree jab bijepi ke varisht netaaon ko mili to un longon ne bhi virodh jaahir kiya
 At that time Uma Bharti was on the Ganges migration, she also protested on social media and by the evening, it became clear that the BJP would not form a government with independent mlas
 udhar jananaayak janata party ne bijepi ke saath sarkaar banane ko taiyaar ho gai or haryana main pehali baar bijepi gathbandhan kii sarkaar bani
 But in Maharashtra, the bjp-shiv Sena could not form a government even after getting majority
 maharashtra (maharashtra Politics) ke chunaav parinaam aane ke baad shivasena ne mukhyamantri pad kii maang shuru kar di
 It was told by the Shiv Sena that before the election, the BJP had agreed to the Chief Minister for two-and-a-half years, but after the election results came, the BJP refused to fulfill its promise
 bijepi kii ore se bhi baat banane kii ummid thi lekin yah ummid us samay samaapt ho gaya jab bijepi kii ore se rajyapal ko yah suchit kiya gaya ki bijepi sarkaar banane main asamarth he
 Here Arvind Sawant, the only Shiv Sena minister in the Modi government at the Center, resigned from the Union Cabinet and Shiv Sena announced his withdrawal from the NDA
 iske baad shivasena ne ensipi se sampark kiya or yah sanket mila ki vah samarthan de sakati he
 Although the Shiv Sena failed to give any letter of support to the Governor, but demanded more time from the Governor
 rajyapal ne unki maang kothukaraa diya
 Meanwhile, the Congress continued to hold meetings throughout the day to support the Shiv Sena, but with no results
 sutron ke hawaale se yah khabar ai ki congress sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan dene ko taiyaar he lekin isaki ghoshnaa nahin kii gai
 There was also news about the Congress meeting with NCP but it was not clear what the latest situation was
 aaj ensipi vidhayakon kii baithak ho rahi he jiske baad sarkaar banane ko lekar ensipi kii sthiti spasht ho jaaegi
 At present, the matter of government formation in Maharashtra is hanging in the balance
 aapako bataa den ki maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav me bijepi ko 105, shivasena ko 56, ensipi ko 54 or congress ko 44 siten mili hai
 The BJP and Shiv Sena together crossed the 145 mark
 lekin shivasena ne 50-50 formule kii maang rakh di jiske mutabik dhai-dhai saal sarkaar chalaane kaa model tha
 Shiv Sena says that the agreement with BJP was done on this formula but BJP claims that no such agreement was reached
 isi lekar matbhed itnaa badha ki donon partiyon kii 30 saal puraani dosti tut gai

 The disputed statement made by Sadhvi Pragya Thakur on the martyr Hemant Karkare in the 26 / 11 Mumbai terror attack, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (R
S
 defended by RSS) leader Indresh Kumar
 indresh kumaar ne bhopal main press conference ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki pragna thakur ne karunaa dikhaai thi, jab unhone sweekaar kiya ki hemanth karkare shahid the
 Indresh Kumar said that the then Congress government misused the agencies
 saath hi vardi main rahakar bhagava aatankwaad ko sabit karne ke liye adhikaron kaa galat istemaal kar logon ko fansaaya gaya
 He said that we respect Hemant Karkare for his martyrdom
 lekin duusari taraf logon ko ye bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki unhone ek sadhvi ko aatankwaad main fansaane ke liye atyaachaar kiya he
 People should accept this thing
 loksabhaa chunaav ke samay madhya pradesh kii bhopal seat se bhartiya janata party kii ummidavaar sadhvi pragna thakur ne mumbai hamale main shahid hue hemanth karkare ko lekar vivaadit bayaan diya tha
 Pragya Thakur said that he falsely implicated me
 saath hi pragna ne kaha tha ki apane karmon kii vajah se mare hai
 BJP MP Sadhvi Pragya had also made a statement here that Hemant Karkare had treated her quite unfairly and falsely implicated her
 karkare kii maut hamaare shraap se hui he
 Sadhvi said that this was her deviousness, this was treason and was unprincipled
 wo mujhase poochta tha ki kya mujhe sach ke liye bhagwaan ke paas janaa hoga, to maine kaha tha ki aapako jarurat he to jaaie
 i told him that you will have an apocalypse, he abused me

 Kohli told reporters on the eve of the match, "we are seeing it as a (spin attack) force and we will try to take full advantage of it
" hamaare spinner yahaan kii paristhitiyon ko acchhee tarah se jaanate hai or unhen khelnaa vastav main bahut mushkil hoga
 He said, England struggled in front of spinners in the first match and especially on such a wicket, we will keep this weakness in our target in the middle overs
 england ke ballebaajon ko hyderabad main khele gaye pehle match main ravinder jadeja or ravichandran aswin ko khilne main kaaphi pareshaani hui thi
 Both of them were instrumental in stacking England for 174 runs with three wickets each
 firozshah kotla kii pich ke bare main kohli ne kaha ki isaki prakruti main bahut badlaav nahin aayaa he, lekin unhone ummid jataai ki kal match main isamen thodaa oochaal dekhne ko milegaa
 He said, this pitch has always been slow and there is not much bounce in it
 isamen haalanki ab thodaa sudhaar hua he
 Even though there will not be much bounce in it, but it is better than before
 aaj tak ne mangalvaar ko ek sting 'oparation dilli police' dikhaaya
 It showed how Delhi's policemen are filling pockets with bribe money
 is sting kaa asar ye hua ki khabar chalane ke teen ghante ke andar hi 7 pulisavaalon ko suspend kar diya gaya or maamle kii jaanch sibiai ko saunp di gai
 But Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has questioned the speed of Delhi Police and Home Ministry
 unka kahana he ki aazaadee ke baad pehali baar aisa hua he jab dilli police ne bhrashtachar ke aaropon par itani teji se karrwai kii ho
 There is doubt about a fair investigation, yet we will trust the CBI
 ummid karte hai ki jaanch main doshi pakade jaaenge
 Regarding the Aaj Tak sting 'operation Delhi Police', Kejriwal said, 'the way Delhi Police officers were shown taking bribe on the channel till Tuesday
 yah yahi bataata he ki dilli police aaj dilli main keval paise batorne kii mashin ban gai he
 This money goes up
 kahaan tak
 
 
 This will be known only after investigation
 'unhone kaha, 'kal jab tivi par sting main pulicekarmiyon ko paise lete dikhaaya gaya to turant hi maine apane mukhya sachiv se baat kii or unhone anti karpshan department se baat kii
 We had decided that the Delhi government would take action on the matter
 ghoose lene ke aropiyon ko giraftaar kiya jayega
 'kejriwal further said,' Delhi Government's Anti Corruption Branch has the authority to investigate corruption by Delhi Police
 yahi vichaar tha hamaara
 As soon as we decided this, the Delhi Police and the Ministry of Home Affairs took action with swiftness from the other side
 mujhe nahin lagata he ki aazaadee ke baad se aaj tak kisi masale par itani teji se karrwai hui ho
 During the TV program itself, the Delhi Police wrote a letter to the Ministry of Home Affairs to refer the case to the CBI
 grih mantralay ne bhi jaanch sibiai ko saunp di
 It is a very good thing that the country's machinery is now working so fast, but there are doubts
 'jaanch ko lekar dilli ke mukhyamantri bole, 'nishpaksh jaanch ko lekar man main shankaa hoti he
 Delhi Police is under Ministry of Home Affairs, CBI is also under Ministry of Home Affairs
 kahin yah puure maamle ko rafa-dfa karne kii koshish to nahin
 We do not want to do politics
 sibiai jaanch kar rahi he to wo kare
 We will keep an eye on the investigation and the results will be awaited

 manmohan singh The issue of terrorism was important for India at the BRICS summit held in Goa on 15–16 October
 uri hamale ke baad bharat ne pioke main sargical strike kar pakistan ko jhatka diya tha
 Now, even during the BRICS conference, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has heard Pakistan strongly about terrorism
 aaie, dekhte hai, is sammelan se bharat ko kya hasil hua
 
 
 Terrorism: During the India Cobrix Conference, which has been facing terrorism for decades, it has been successful to build a consensus on this issue
 yah sammelan uri main hue aatanki hamale ke maheene bhar ke bheetar hua
 India has blamed Pakistan-based terrorist organization jaish-e-muhammad for this attack and campaigned to isolate Pakistan diplomatically on this issue
 bricks sammelan ke dauraan piem modi ne aatankwaad ko puri duniya ke liye khatra bataate hue isse kadai se nipatane par jor diya
 Modi strongly targeted Pakistan from the BRICS platform, calling it the birthplace of terrorism
 modi ne kaha, 'bricks sammelan ke ghoshnaptr main aatankwaad kii kade shabdon main ninda kii gai or kaha gaya ki yah un desh kii sarkaron kii jimmedaari he ki apni jameen se kisi tarah kii aatankwaadi gatividhiyon ko roke
 The BRICS message repeatedly mentioned banned organizations such as the IAIS
 dephence:bricks sammelan se pehle bharat or rus ke bich 16 ahm samjhauton par dastakhat hue
 Agreement for joint production of 200 Kamov helicopters signed between India and Russia
 iske alaava chaar nausainik frigate or paanch S-400 supersonic air dephence system kii kharidari ke liye qaraar par bhi dastakhat kiye gaye
 Energy cooperation: Russia is looking for strong energy allies amidst falling oil and gas prices and large scale production from Iran, Iraq and African countries and increased production towards the US
 vahiin, china or bharat ko apni growth ke ingine ke liye zyada urja sansadhano kii jarurat he
 Although this idea was the brainchild of Russian President Vladimir Putin, but it will also be very beneficial for China and India
 bricks sammelanke ghoshnaptr main bharat ke liye parmaanu urja or newclear trade kii jaruraton kaa zikr kiya gaya
 This reinforced India's efforts to gain membership of the NSG
 kaarobaar:modi or putin ne kudankulam newclear plant kii unit 3 or 4 kii neenv rakhi
 India and Russia are also going to cooperate in the field of energy and infrastructure construction

 essar oil ko kharidne vaale is company par chaar arab dollar ke karj kii jimmedaari bhi uthaaenge
 Diplomacy: During the BRICS conference, India tried to isolate Pakistan once again by inviting the heads of the BIMSTEC countries instead of SAARC
 bricks sammelan ke dauraan bimstek ke netaaon kii mulaakaat china, rus, dakshin africa or brazil ke netaaon se hui
 After the Uri attacks, India boycotted the SAARC conference in Islamabad, while many other countries also did not participate in it
 pakistan isse alag thalag najar aayaa or phir aisa mana jane laga ki bharat bimstek ko zyada badhaava degaa kyonki isamen pakistan shaamil nahin he
 China and Russia's activities did not appear to be in India's favor after the Uri attack and surgical strikes in pok
 uri hamale ke baad bharat ne pakistan ko alag-thalag karne kii koshish kii thi
 When India talked about reviewing the Indus River Agreement, China started the exercise to stop the Brahmaputra water
 uri hamale ke baad donon padosi mulkon ke bich tanaav kii sthiti paidaa ho gai to roosi sena pakistani sena ke saath sanyukt yuddhayas ke liye pakistan pahunch gai
 The news came that this exercise would take place in a disputed area between India and Pakistan
 bharat ko apane puraane sahyogi se aisi ummid nahin thi
 However, before the BRICS conference, Russia made it clear that this exercise would not take place in the disputed area and India had nothing to worry about

 unhone na sirf apni sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon kaa raag gaaya balki rashtrawaad ko punerjeevit bhi kiya
 Nationalism became the main weapon of his arsenal
 jab modi ko gujarat kaa mukhyamantri banaaya gaya tha tab vah nae the
 Some staunch critics said that Modi won his first assembly election because of the 2002 riots
 lekin unki lagaataar 2007 or 2012 kii jeet ne matadaataaon ke saath unke judaav or takat ko sabit kar diya
 Had there been another leader, he would have been careless
 vahiin duusari taraf modi jaanate the ki jab tak unki chhavi gujarat dangon se paribhaashit hoti rahegi, vah aage nahin ja paaenge
 He associated his Hindu image with the nationalism of Gujarat
 iske saath hi unhone vikaas kaa alankaar gadha
 Before them, no leader has experimented with integrating Identity Politics and economic needs of the people
 modi kaa 'gujarat model' safaltaapurvak rashtriya str par laayaa gaya
 In his last five years, he has failed on the economic front but the metaphor of his development has never faded
 unhone vipakshiyon or visheshgyon ke sabhi daavon ko nirast kar diya, wo apane daawey main drudh rahe ki unke netritv main bharat ne nai oonchaaiyon ko chuaa or teji se badhati arthvyavastha vaala desh bana he
 At the time when he looked weak, Balakot Strak worked
 modi smart the jo bharat kii janata tak yah sandesh pahunchane main kaamyaab rahe ki unke netritv main desh badla or ye bharat majbootee se jawaab bhi de rahaa he
 It could be heard on the streets, "we entered Pakistan and killed them
" "is balashaali rashtrawaad ko media main unke doston ne badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya
 Right from the beginning, TV channels refused to criticize him and he became a mouthpiece on the issue of nationalism
 isi tarah whatsapp, fasebuk, twitor or duusare soshal media placeform par bhi isi baat kaa ho-hallaa tha
 Modi's army was truly invincible keeping the story that Modi is the only leader who needs India again and the country is fearless and safe in his hands
 lagaataar vipaksh ko nakaarna or din-ba-din modi ke mahimamandan se bijepi ko sidhe phayda mila
 And with Amit Shah's organizational skills, the BJP transformed its cadres and teams into huge, well-oiled machines
 modi, mashin or media ke sangyojan ne bhartiya chunavi prakriya ko puri tarah se badal diya he
 This combination has also given rise to the politics of caste identity
 jis tarah hindutv kii badi pahchaan ne jati kii choti pahchaan ko aanshik rup se abhibhoot kar diya he
 If the result of UP is some kind of gesture, then parties like BSP and SP will have to rethink their strategies
 mandal ayog ke sujhaavon ko lagu karne ke baad jatigat raajnneeti visheshkar obisi or dalit par raajnneeti bad gai thi
 Mulayam, Lalu, Kanshi Ram and Mayawati were the new warriors of identity politics
 or unki jati kii raajnneeti ne hindutv ko ek bindu se aage nahin badhane diya
 But they forgot to grow and grow
 mulaayam obisi ke netaa the lekin apni adoordarshita ke chalate vah sirf yadavon ke netaa banakar rah gaye
 In the same way Mayawati could not progress beyond the Jatavs
 aarthik oochaal or loktantric chetana ke failaav ke saath ye netaa apni jati kaa vistaar karne main asafal rahe he or ek nayaa gathbandhan unke liye vinaashkari sabit hua
 Meanwhile, Modi and Shah managed to make leaders of smaller castes like Rajbhar and Nishad successful
 aaj bada sawaal yah he ki kya hindutv ne bijepi ko us jagah par baitha diya he jahaan pehle congress indira or nehru ke samay thi? kuch tathyon ko maananaa hi hoga
 Modi-led Hinduism is the new ruling ideology and it will not be easy for any other political ideology to pull it out
 bijepi kii vishaal nirvaachit mashin se ladane ke liye vipaksh ko isi ke baraabar kaarykushal mashin banani hogi
 And above all, leaders have to make intentions like warrior
 modi safal isliye hai kyonki wo jeetne ke liye ladate hai
 The same cannot be said of Rahul Gandhi or anyone else
 ladaai jeetne ke baad modi aaraam nahin karte balki wo agle padaav kii ore chal dete hai
 For him, politics is a long-term war and the opposition is a long-time enemy who has to be defeated at any cost

 philhal desh kii phijaaon main jo charchaa sabase zyada garm he, wo haniprit ke alaava kuch bhi nahin
 Knowing the reality of this mouth-watering daughter of Gurmeet Ram Rahim, people are either surprised or her and Gurmeet's relationship has become a joke for the people
 kul milakar akhbaar se website tak tivi se soshal media tak haniprit hi chai hui he
 But let us tell you that as much as you know about Honeypreet, it is nothing but her story is something else
 jitna rahasy haniprit ke gaayab ho jane main he, utana hi raaj uski tamaam jindagi main bhi he
 Honeypreet's name is also a secret
 haniprit kaa mata-pita ke alaava uski ek bahan or ek bhai he
 Born on 21 July 1980 in Fatehabad, Haryana
 pita bijnesaman the to sochaa ki padhaa likhaa ke kuch banaaenge
 Honeypreet studied but did not use it to become anything but to make Gurmeet into Baba, because this baby, with the help of Baba, was nurturing the dream of being in Bollywood and then Hollywood
 haniprit kaa ye naam or ye pahchaan hameshaa se nahin thi, yah sab to uske munhabhole papa kaa diya hua tha
 Honeypreet was something else before Gurmeet Singh came close
 jab vah skool main padhati thi, tab uskaa naam priyanka taneja hua karata tha
 At that time, the principal of Priyanka Taneja's school is also surprised to know that the shy and homely girl who studies with her is today's Honeypreet
 haryana ke fatehabad kaa makanahaniprit ke bachapanse lekar uski sagaai tak kii jindagi kaa gavaah he
 Honeypreet used to live with her family in this house a while back
 jagjeevanpura kii galiyon se ek aam ladki kii tarah uskaa aana janaa rahata tha
 This house and this street were the first time in the life of Honeypreet, she was dazzled by the glow of Gurmeet Ram Rahim's blistering entry
 darasal haniprit urf priyanka taneja kaa parivaar pehle se hi dere se judaa tha
 Honeypreet's grandfather worked as an administrator in the camp
 fatehabad ke makaan se jab haniprit kii sagaai hui to gurmeet ram rahim khud is samaaroh main shaamil hone pahunchaa tha
 Ram Rahim's vision and dazzling were first noticed by the people of Fatehabad
 uske swaagat main puure mohalle ko dulhan kii tarah sajaayaa gaya tha
 Honeypreet was already married to Fatehabad, but married at her Sirsa camp under Baba's patronage and after Honeypreet's marriage, suddenly her entire family left their home in Fatehabad and moved to Baba Ram Rahim's camp in Sirsa
 
 sutron ke mutabik baba kii sharan main aane se pehle or haniprit ke baba ke kareeb aane se bhi pehle, uski maa baba ko apana parameshwar maan baithi thi or unheen ki jid par parivaar fatehabad se sirsa ke dere main ja basaa tha
 The royal way in which Gurmeet Singh reached her engagement shows that he had a special place in his heart about Honeypreet
 vakt bitne ke saath yah jagah or khaas hoti gai
 It came to such a situation that Gurmeet, adopting two daughters and a son of his own, adopted Honeypreet and announced to make her his daughter in front of the world, that too after 9 years of Honeypreet's marriage
 haniprit sirf baba ke kareeb hi nahin thi, balki vah aisa panchakard thi jiske bina baba ke dere kaa darwaja khulata hi nahin tha
 Not like Gurmeet but he did not have less status than Gurmeet
 ab gurmeet kii duniya main uski hanak or arabon kharbon kaa samrajya kareeb kareeb lut chukaa he
 Honeypreet herself is wandering somewhere in the unknown, like the desolate queen of a plundered princely state
 lekin 25 agast se pehle tak baba ke naam kii vah riyasat jab gulzaar thi
 Honeypreet's status was no less than that of an empress there
 haniprit na sirf baba kii sabase kareebi thi, balki vah ram rahim or deraa kii sabase badi raajadaar bhi he
 Baba Ram Rahim used to take advice only from Honeypreet before taking any decision
 baba kii is baby ke haath main dere kii sabhi chaabiyaan rahati thim
 From the money, every decision that was related to the camp was made by Honeypreet
 haniprit hi ram rahim ke film production kaa kaam sambhalati thi
 All of Baba's films were directed by Honeypreet

bjp and Election Commission are meeting
 No question was raised on the election of Rajya Garden
 We did not question the bjp's 2014 victory
 The BJP was overconfident in Delhi 2015 and Bihar 2015 so tempering will not be conducted in the truth
 The lie will be mixed only then it will be trusted, there is difference between theft and robbery
 We will show EVM in front of Election Commission by hacking if Election Commission If you do not hack in front of us, then the punishment which will be given by the Election Commission will be approved ullekhneey he ki dilli sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr bulaayaa, jisamen aam aadmi party ke vidhayak saurabh bharadwaj ne ek iviem tip mashin kii live tempring kaa live demo dikhaaya

 do sau se zyada pravasi bhartiya upi sarkaar ke bulaave par apane grih pradesh main ikattha the
 The main hall of Agra's famous ITC Mughal Hotel on Fatehabad Road by the time of five o'clock on the evening of 4 January was filled with cheers from expatriate (NRI) Indians
 aadhe ghante baad upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne manch ke ek kone par rakhe deep ko jalaakar kaarykram kaa udghaatan kiya
 The stage was set, a round of speeches began
 kareeb aadhe ghante baad, yuai main hotel vyavsaay se jude pravasi bhartiya yusuf ali (manchasin) kii baari ai
 He said, "indians living in Africa say that the body is in Africa, money is in London and the mind is still in India
" mujhe avasar mila to meri company lakhanu main hotel or shopping mal ke nirmaan main ek hajaar karod ru
 Will invest in which around three thousand people will get jobs
 ”itnaa sunate hi mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne peeche baithe apane vishesh sachiv ji
 s
 naveen kumaar ko bulaakar unke kaan main kuch kaha
 Meanwhile, Chief Secretary Alok Ranjan, sitting on the other side of the stage, also wrote something on paper and gave it to Naveen Kumar
 ali ke bhaashan puraa karne ke baad kursi par baithte hi naveen kumaar or unke bich kuch phusafasaahat hui
 By the time the opening ceremony was over half an hour later, a step had already been taken to turn Yusuf Ali's dream into reality
 audyogic vibhaag ke ek vishesh sachiv str ke adhikari kii jimmedaari tay kar di gai thi jise yusuf ali ke saath sahyog karnaa tha
 This rapid development of the Samajwadi Party (SP) government led by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is a new change in government functioning
 akhilesh sarkaar ko isi teji ke boote vidhansabha chunaav kii dundubhi bajane se pehle isi saal apane saare mahatvakankshi project puure karne hai
 The three-day first NRI summit in UP has given a "task" to all the officials, from small to large, of the industrial department to make more than a dozen investment agreements with nris a reality
 upi kii solahavin vidhansabha main bahumat kii sarkaar chalaane vaali samaajawaadee party ne 21veen shatabdi ke solahaven varsh main vikaas kii us gaatha kii patakatha taiyaar kii he jiske jariye uske aage ke rajnatik sapane puure honge
 Akhilesh Yadav tried his best to improve the image of the SP government by successfully organizing the first Pravasi Bharatiya Sammelan of UP from 4 to 6 January at brandingagra via NRI
 sitambar main mumbai main hui “inwestors meet” main bina bulaave ke pahunche sapa netaaon ke huddang se sabak lete hue agra ke itisi mughal hotel main kadi suraksha thi
 This was the first program of the SP government in any city of UP in which the least leaders of the party were present
 ek bhi gairajaruri vyakti ko nyotaa nahin diya gaya tha
 Former SP city president Farrukhsiyar of Agra was arrested without any fuss when he tried to forcefully enter the venue with his supporters
 akhilesh yadav is kaarykram ke jariye yah sandesh dena chaahate the ki unki sarkaar pravasi bharatiyon ko lekar puri gambhirtha barat rahi he
 Although the SP government was planning to organize this conference from February 28 last year, but it was agreed to do it this year if the non-resident Indians do not show interest
 pichley varsh gujarat main yojit hue pravasi bhartiya sammelan main shirkat karne vaale upi ke mukhya sachiv alok ranjan bataate hai, “har varsh janvari ke pehle hafte main enarai centre sarkaar ke pravasi sammelan main shirkat karne bharat aate hai
 Around these dates, a strategy was made to organize NRI in UP as well
 ” pichley varsh aktubar main sapa sarkaar main cabinet mantri ke rup main shaamil hue purv akali dal netaa balavant singh ramuwalia kii bhoomika bhi is sammelan ke jariye kuch spasht hui
 Akhilesh Yadav may have made him Minister of Prison Department, but the real intention is to take advantage of Ramuwalia's relations with overseas Indians living abroad
 ramuwalia kehete hai, “main april main america main ek bada kaarykram yojit kar saktaa hum jisamen pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa swaagat karne vaale bharatiyon se kahin adhik 10,000 se zyada bhartiya mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kaa swaagat karenge
 Time to complete the project The sp's very poor performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections opened the eyes of the Chief Minister
 iske baad unhone apni sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ko vikaas ke agenda kii ore modaa
 Many new mega projects were launched (see box)
 aise hi ek mahatvakankshi project agra-lakhanu expresve ke shilanyas ke avasar par 23 november, 2014 ko lakhanu main 5 kalidas maarg sthit mukhyamantri awaas par sapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav bhi maujuud the
 Adding Mulayam to Akhilesh, he said, "when i was the Chief Minister, the date of the inauguration of the project was fixed before the foundation stone
 ” mulaayam kii salaah par amal karte hue pradesh sarkaar main mukhya sachiv kii adhyakshata main ek “project monitering cameti” banaai gai or sabhi bade project ko puraa karne ke liye ek taarikh tay kii gai
 (see box) Principal Secretary Industrial Development Mahesh Gupta says that the construction work of so many projects has not started simultaneously by setting the completion date in any state of the country
 sitambar, 2014 main lakhanu metro project kaa nirmaan kaary shuru hua
 Its first phase is targeted to be completed in December this year when the trial run of Lucknow Metro will begin
 lakhanu metro rail korporation ke prabandh nideshak kumaar keshav bataate hai, “hamane pehle lakhanu metro ke puraa hone kii taarikh tay kii
 a strategy was chalked out to complete each phase in a fixed time by dividing the 28 months between the foundation stone and the inauguration into more than a dozen phases
 ”project monitering group janeshwar mishra park, inner ring road agra, bydaree power motariced rickshaw, lakhanu haat, taj ganj project jaisi kul 18 pariyojnaon kii sidhi nigaraanee kar rahaa he
 The Chief Minister's secretary Parthasarathy Sen Sharma has been included as the convening member of this monitoring group
 iske jariye mukhyamantri har maheene sabhi project kii “states report” par najar rakh rahe hai
 Law and order and power challenge: On the second day of the Pravasi Sammelan, nris were apprehensive about the power problem in UP during a group discussion with the officials

 The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi was celebrated with great fanfare on September 2, 2019 across the country
 iske baad logon ne apane reeti-rivaaj ke anusaar ganpati visarjan shuru kar diya he
 Many people perform Ganpati Visarjan ten days after Ganesh Chaturthi, while some people perform immersion by completing the Puja even earlier
 is bich ganpati visarjan ko lekar soshal media par ek video teji se viral ho rahaa he
 What is the claim? With the viral video, it is being claimed that people have left the idols on the pavement after banning Ganapati immersion in Sabarmati river of Ahmedabad
 video ko ek chalati car main se banaaya gaya he jisamen dikh rahaa he ki devi devataaon kii saikadon murtiyon footpath par rakhi hai
 What is Sachindia Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that this video has nothing to do with Ganapati immersion
 yah video ahmedabad kii sabarmati nadi ke paas kaa hi he, lekin takreeban ek maheenaa purana he jab shahar main dasha maa kaa parv manaaya gaya tha
 Thousands of people have shared the video with this misleading claim
 Padmini Natarajan naam ke ek fasebuk yujar ne is video ko shanivaar ko post kiya tha jise abhi tak 7,400 se bhi zyada log share kar chuke hai
 Author and political analyst Zainab Sikander has also raised objection by tweeting this video
 At the risk of being called a jihadi terrorist for simply voicing my opinion on an environmental issue, may i please just ask those who do the Ganpati Visarjan in natural water bodies: WHY can't you use eco-friendly, biodegradable (non-toxic paint) idols?pic

 According to him, this video is not of Ganesh Visarjan, but of immersion of idols of Dasha Ma, which took place in Ahmedabad a month ago
 ahmedabad badal rahaa he
 Will read till the end

 For two days, many people have been asking me to know the truth of this video
 is liye likh rahaa hoon
 First of all, make it clear that the video is not of Ganesh Visarjan
 ek maheene purana dasha maan ke visarjan ke samay kaa he@vnehra1 / 5pic
 twitter
 com / i4g682yuwx— Nirnay Kapoor (@nirnaykapoor)september 9, 2019nirnay kaa kahana he ki ahmedabad nagar nigam ne sabarmati nadi main kisi bhi prakaar kii murtiyon kaa visarjan karne par pabandi lagaai he
 In view of this, last month, people had left the idols of Dasha Ma on the pavement near the river, which were later removed and immersed in a special way by the Municipal Corporation
 nirnay ne ye bhi bataaya he ki is baar ahmedabad main ganpati visarjan 12 sitambar ko hoga jiske liye 61 vishaal kunda banaae gaye hai
 Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation Commissioner Vijay Nehra has also rightly said the decision
 vijay nehra ne apana ek purana twit bhi ritvit kiya he jisamen unhone dasha maa ke visarjan ko lekar kuch tasviren or ek video share kiya tha
 While sharing the tweet, Vijay has written that the claim being made with the viral video is false and similar videos and photos he tweeted a month ago
 i shared this one month ago

 co / yxir8l46zr— Vijay Nehra (@vnehra) September 9, 2019 Vijay Nehra made this tweet on 11 August
 twit kii gai tasveeron or video ko dekhne se saafe samaj aata he ki viral video bhi usee samay kaa he
 In these pictures too, idols of Gods and Goddesses can be seen placed on the pavement like viral videos
 is bare main hamane khud vijay nehra se bhi baat kii
 He said that the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation had launched a campaign called Swachh Sabarmati during Environment Day
 uske baad sabarmati nadi main kisi bhi prakaar kii murtiyon kaa visarjan karne par pabandi lagaai gai he
 Therefore, after this campaign, the idols of Dasha Maa who came to immerse in the river, kept the idols outside the Sabarmati riverfront
 in murtiyon ko baad main nagar nigam apane tareeke se prakruti main mila detaa he
 Our Ahmedabad correspondent Gopi Ghanghar also reached the Sabarmati River Front and confirmed Jankari that there are no idols for Ganpati immersion
 yahaan par ye baat spasht hoti he ki jis video ko ganpati visarjan kaa bataakar viral kiya gaya he vah darasal ek maheenaa purana video he or dasha maa murti visarjan se judaa he
 If we look at them then they are quite different among themselves
 ye aisi shakhsiyaten hai jinaki apni soch, vivaad paidaa karne kii kshamtaayen or gathbandhanon ke saath judane sareekhee bhinnataayen hai
 But one thing that can be said about them is to garner support for themselves from the same socio-economic base
 bihar raajnneeti kii trimurti lalu prasad yadav, ramvilas paswan or nitish kumaar, teenon kaa hi kaaravaan ek hi disha main bad rahaa he
 That is, the goal of all three is the same but the paths are different
 ek hi darshan se nirdeshit or apni rajnatik mahatvakankshaon ko lekar chal rahe in raajnneetikon ko kaayam karnaa he to sirf bihar kii raajnneeti par varchasv
 Just here, the problem arises because there is always less space at the top and there is not enough space to accommodate three political parties
 yahi vah baat he jo in teenon ke raaston ko alag-alag kar detii he
 The special thing is that these three leaders who emerged from JP movement want to become politically powerful in Bihar today
 usee kaa nateeja he ki maujuuda loksabhaa chunaav main inkaa bahut kuch daanv par laga hua he
 If we talk about the observers, they believe that for Lalu Prasad and Paswan, the Lok Sabha elections are not only a means to reach their goals but also important in terms of remaining in national politics
 yah kahana katai atishyokti nahin hoga ki inke liye loksabhaa chunaav karo yaa maro jaisi sthiti he
 This election is no less important for Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar as the results will show that he is very close to the top chair in Delhi or he still needs to do a lot in Bihar
 yahi nahin, agar nattejey behtareen tareeke se janata dal (united) ke paksh main chale jate hai, to vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki nitish apni sahyogi bhaajapa se alag hone ke bare main bhi soch sakate hai
 Now the voting in three phases is over in Bihar and in the fourth phase elections are to be held for only three out of 40 Lok Sabha seats in the state, all the hearts have become heartbroken
 sabko intjaar is baat kaa he ki janata kii lahar nitish kumaar ke saath he yaa lalu-paswan gathbandhan ke saath
 This is the right time to assess their strategies and their stakes in Bihar and their roadblocks
 swaabhaavik he ki in teenon kaa bahut kuch daanv par laga hua he
 Today, Lalu Prasad, who lost power in the state at the hands of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by Nitish Kumar in 2005, wants to do better in the Lok Sabha elections in order to maintain his standing in politics
 dekha jaae to rashtriya raajnneeti main lalu prasad or paswan kaa jo kad he, uskaa ekmaatr kaaran loksabhaa main unki sthiti hi he
 The post of Union Minister he got is also the result of these figures
 tabhi to jab in donon diggajon ko khatre kaa ehsaas hua to unhone ek baar phir loksabhaa chunaav main saath utarane kaa faisla le liya jiske liye lalu-paswan ko kai balidaan bhi dene pade
 One of them is Lalu Prasad's refusal to give tickets to his brother-in-law, Sadhu Yadav, on which Sadhu joined Congress
 is baar 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke ulat lalu prasad ko kahin se bhi doosraa aasraa nahin he kyonki us samay rajya main apni sarkaar hone ke kaaran unke paas nirbhar hone ke liye atirikt samarthan tha
 But today their enemies are ruling Patna
 badtar yah ki jo kabhi dost (congress) the ve aaj saamne khadey ho chunauti de rahe hai
 Lalu is afraid that if he fails to win a significant number of seats in the Lok Sabha, then after the election, his stature will also decrease in front of Sonia Gandhi
 isiilie rajd pramukh ke paas pareshaan hone ke paryaapt kaaran maujuud hai
 However, senior Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee has made it clear that Lalu Prasad is still a part of the UPA
 haalanki unhone pehle yah bhi kaha tha ki rail mantri agali sarkaar kaa hissaa nahin honge jisase bihar ke purv badshaah ke liye chetavanee bhare sanket saaf chhipe hue the
 Similarly, Paswan is also a self-proclaimed kingmaker in Bihar politics and in his own eyes a qualified candidate for the country's top post
 lekin is par bhi gaur farmaaiega, ve lok janashakti party (lojpa) ke pramukh hai or loksabhaa main unke paas maatr chaar saansad hai
 In such a situation, the responsibility of being effective and in demand has increased further among the potential partners over Paswan in 2009
 yahi vah kaaran he jiske chalate paswan ne rajd pramukh ke khilaaf shuru main aag ugalane ke baad, aakhir main unhen bihar main apane bade sahyogi ke taur par gale laga liya
 As such, Paswan also enjoys an alliance because despite him having "a committed vote bank" in Bihar, the records indicate that the Union Steel Minister has little presence on his own in the home state
 sakshya itihaas main darj hai
 Take the November 2005 assembly election, in which he contested alone, and was the one with the most losses
 unhen sirf 13 siten mili thim jabaki farvari 2005 ke chunaav main unhone 29 siten jiti thim
 Not only this, his party is contesting 12 seats in the current Lok Sabha elections, if they do not win a significant number of seats then the time will not be pleasant for them
 vaise bhi puraane record yah saaf kar dete hai ki congress aisi party he jo pehla mauka milte hi apana hisaab baraabar kar leti he
 If we look at the 14th Lok Sabha, except for big players like Mulayam Singh Yadav, who had 39 seats, the Congress invited parties who had fewer seats to join the government
 yah congress kaa jawaab tha kyonki april 1999 main vaajapeyi sarkaar girane ke baad samaajawaadee party ne congress kaa samarthan nahin kiya tha
 This is a clear indication that the Congress does not believe in forgetting and forgiving the traitors
 yah lalu-paswan ke liye bhi buree khabar he
 It is no wonder that in order to avoid being marginalized after the election, lalu-paswan has also started supporting NCP chief Sharad Pawar for the country's top post by changing tracks
 lalu-paswan, jinhone kuch samay pehle hi mulaayam singh yadav ke saath milakar chauthe morche kaa gathan kiya he, kai kaarnon se pavaar kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 There is also a news in the political corridors of Patna that if LK Advani's dream of becoming Prime Minister remains incomplete, then Nitish Kumar can also be considered to be in the race for this post
 mana jaataa he ki kshetreey partiyon main nitish kii kaaphi had tak sweekaaryata he
 But if lalu-paswan supports Sharad Pawar and gets the support of the Third Front, then Nitish's prospects can easily get dusty
 yahi vah kaaran he jiske chalate bihar kii raajnneeti ke donon diggaj har sambhav koshish karne main jute hue hai
 This also indicates that apart from joining the Congress-led UPA government, lalu-paswan will also have to accept the Third Front
 nitish kumaar ke liye bane rahane kii koi samasya nahin he- unhone rajya main satta sanbhaalane ke baad se apane kad ko or badhaayaa hi he
 Not only this, he has campaigned vigorously for the NDA in the state as he has the opportunity to prove that his political status has surpassed the other two (lalu-paswan)
 nitish ne lalu-paswan ke ulat desh ke sheersh pad ke liye kabhi bhi koi ichha nahin jataai, lekin unhen aakhri kshan tak apane pattey chhipaae rakhane ke liye bhi janaa jaataa he
 It is also known that Nitish is not contesting elections, but he has left no stone unturned to campaign
 isi se ishaara mil jaataa he ki kitna kuch daanv par laga hua he
 Obviously, Nitish has made these additional efforts only for the better performance of the candidates
 agar nitish kii raajnneeti par najar daudai jaae to yah saaf ho jaataa he ki ve lalu-paswan kii hi tarah vyaktitv aadhaarit raajnneeti karne main adhik yakeen rakhte hai
 What JD (U) did in these elections - from not giving tickets to George Fernandes and Digvijay Singh to giving a ticket to a new player like Kaushalendra in Nalanda - also points to this
 yahi nahin, jab nitish party adhyaksh nahin hai lekin unhone apni chhavi party adhyaksh se kisi bhi myne main kamatar nahin rakhi
 Not only this, under his professional style and political justification, there is a man who has worked hard in the journey of his career
 patna main, nitish apni badi yojanaon ko amalijama pahanaate hai
 The result of this is that they have chosen friends who are more supporters and soldiers
 tabhi to unamem se kai ko chunaav maidan main bhi utaar chuke hai
 For example, they have given the opportunity to contest the elections to Monajir Hussain and Arjun Rai, who were removed from the cabinet last year
 lagata he, nitish maanate hai ki agar koi cabinet mantri banane kaa uchit paatr nahin he to use loksabhaa bhej diya janaa chahie
 Or does Nitish Kumar want people who follow him - not people who raise their voices and become party candidates for tomorrow
 yahi nahin, nitish kumaar khud ko sahi siddh karne kii bharsak koshish bhi kar rahe hai
 In the same exercise of keeping his image clean, he has kept himself apart from issues like Ram Mandir, Uniform Civil Code and Article 370 included in the election manifesto of his coalition partner BJP
 is masale par nitish safai dete najar aae ki rajg apane nunatam saajha kaarykram ko hi aage badhayega
 Analysts believe that if the post-election equations need to be politically restructured, Nitish will not shy away from his alliance partner BJP
 congress pehle hi kai maukon par unki prashansa kar chuki he
 Indirect indications have also been given that the Chief Minister of Bihar is welcome in the UPA
 duusari ore, vampanthi dal bhi nitish kumaar ko tisare morche main shaamil karne kaa khulaa nimantran liye hue hai
 As of now, Nitish Kumar maintains his support with the nda's prime ministerial candidate
 lekin donon hi sthitiyon main-agar jad(you) bahut acha pradarshan karata he yaa apeksha ke anuroop nattejey nahin milte hai-main sambhaavnaaen bani rahati hai
 Nitish may possibly get rid of the BJP to play a larger role in national politics
 isamen bhi koi tajjub nahin ki nitish bihar bhar main tej-tarraar prachaar abhiyaan chalaae hue hai, swaabhaavik he ki iskaa kaaran alpsankhyakon ke kalyaan ke liye unki sarkaar dwaara pichley saadhe teen saalon main jin packejon kii ghoshnaa kii gai, unki duhai dekar lalu ke muslim-yadav vot bank main send lagaana he
 Nitish often thinks about the future, it became clear at the same time that he announced reservations for the highly backward classes in panchayats and local bodies
 lekin, yahaan ek samasya maujuud he
 The NDA is hoping that Nitish Kumar's minority welfare package - including distribution of free books to Muslim children and scholarship and rehabilitation of the victims of the Bhagalpur riots - will help in attracting minority votes in Bihar
 lekin is baat kii sambhaavna hameshaa kaayam rahati he ki ho saktaa he muslim rajg ko vot na den
 The reason for this is with the BJP
 is baat kii bhi charchaa he ki agar chunaav baad yah vishleshan kiya jaataa he ki nitish kumaar kii dharmanirpeksh chhavi ke baavjood badi sankhya main alpsankhyakon ne rajg ko vot nahin die hai to bihar ke mukhyamantri bhaajapa rupi badhate bhaar ko halkaa karne ke bare main bhi soch sakate hai
 It is no wonder that lalu-paswan has joined hands to strengthen his position in the state
 agar jatigat samikarnon se dekha jaae to yah rajd-lojpa gathbandhan ke paksh main he lekin jad(you)-bhaajapa gathbandhan 2004 kii apeksha is baar adhik majboot sthiti main he
 In the last Lok Sabha election, the UPA alliance won 29 of the 40 seats in Bihar
 upie gathbandhan ko 43
 35 percent votes were received (RJD-30)
 67, lojpa-8
 19 and Congress 4
 49 fisadi) jabaki rajg ko 36
 93 (JD (U) -22)
 36 or bhaajapa-14
 57) Percentage votes were received
 lekin aaj rajd or lojpa ke kattar samarthak bhi is baat ko maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai ki ve itihaas ko doharaa paaenge
 Lalu and Paswan are threatened by Nitish's overall political agenda
 isliye donon hi diggajon ne obisi, yadav, muslim or dalit voton ko ekajute karne kii koshish kii
 Apart from this, he is also eyeing Brahmin votes
 november 2005 ke vidhansabha chunaav main jad(you)-bhaajapa gathbandhan ko 35
 The RJD and Congress got 29 per cent of the votes
 2 fisadi mat hi mil sake the
 10 in the bag of Paswan's LJP, which was contesting alone
 8 fisadi mat aae the
 That is, all three UPA allies were successful in getting more votes than the NDA
 jaahir taur par maujuuda loksabhaa chunaav lalu-paswan ke liye agnipariksha ke samaan hai
 It may possibly be considered as one of the most difficult of his career
 lekin muslim maton ko apni ore khinchne kaa nitish kumaar kaa prayaas hi ekmaatr aisi samasya nahin he jisane lalu-paswan kii neend uda rakhi he balki bihar main congress kaa dobaaraa sir uthaanaa or yadav tathaa muslimon main se apane ummidavaar chunaav maidan main utaarne ne bhi lalu-paswan ke vot bank ke liye khatra paidaa kar diya he
 Congress has fielded Vijay Singh Yadav as its candidate against Lalu Prasad from Pataliputra
 ve lalu prasad ke liye paristhitiyon ko dushkar banane ke liye koi kasar nahin chhod rahe hai
 Lalu Prasad's brother-in-law and now Congress sadhu Yadav can also campaign against his brother-in-law there
 congress ne kai yadav or muslim ummidavaaron ko chunaav maidan main utaara he joki unke maai (muslim-yadav) vot bank par sendhamari kar sakate hai
 Apparently, Muslim voters in Bihar constitute 16 percent of the total voters
 aise main lalu kaa unako lekar chintit hona sahi bhi he
 For so many years, he has been cashing in on targeting Advani and arresting him in 1990
 lekin babari masjid vidhwans maamle par lalu kaa congress par hamalaa puri tarah se aankh khol dene vaala he, jisane unki hataasha ko bakhubi prakat kiya he kyonki bihar main muslimon ko pehle ke ulat rajd ke alaava bhi vikalp najar aa rahaa he
 At the same time, the Congress has understood that the regional allies have been roasting their vote bank, so it wants to once again establish its strong presence in the state
 congress ne bihar main aakhri baar apane dam par 1989-90 tak satta kaayam kii thi
 But the anger of the Congress erupted at a time when lalu-paswan split the seats among themselves and left only three seats for the Congress
 saare vikalpon ko taulne ke baad congress ne rajya kii 37 siton par apane hi dam par chunaav maidan main utarane kaa faisla liya
 But now it remains to be seen whether the Congress will be able to strengthen its position in the state with the help of RJD rebels
 kuch log tark dete hai ki chunaav maidan main akele jane ko duusare drushtikon se dekha janaa chahie
 This means that, unlike the 2004 elections, various options remain open after the election
 haalanki congress ko bihar main ek lanbaa safar tay karnaa he, us rajya main apni haisiyat phir badhaani he jahaan usne 1984 main 54 (avibhajit bihar) main 48 siton par vijay darj kii thi
 At that time, Congress got 51 percent votes in Bihar
 lekin 2004 main bharat kii is sabase puraani party ko rajya main maatr chaar siton par hi chunaav ladane kaa mauka mila or mat fisadi bhi 4
 Only 49 remained
 saaf he ki yah congress party hi he jiske vot bank main send lagaakar lalu, paswan or nitish sareekhe netaaon ne apana janaadhar taiyaar kiya
 If seen, the main issue of the current Lok Sabha elections is to save their supremacy and respect for lalu-paswan, then the Congress wants to once again build its broad base in the state
 duusari ore, nitish kumaar in diggajon se badi apni chhavi bananaa chaahate hai or jo najar aa rahaa he usase kahin aage kii udaan bharna chaahate hai
 Within a fortnight, it will be known how much someone got and who lost how much in these Lok Sabha elections
