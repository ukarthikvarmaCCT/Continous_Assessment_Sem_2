i was able to relate myself to him
 main bhi use pasand karata tha or akele rahata tha
 i was able to understand his condition
 usne mujhe bataati thi ki kaise kaam nahin milane se wo depress ho rahi thi, uske parivaar se uske sambandh achche nahin the, uske pita use chhod chuke the or usne khud ko apane dam par khadaa kiya tha
 He told me that his ex boyfriends abused him
 itnaa hi nahin usne mujhe bataaya tha ki jab vah 14 saal kii thi to landan main ek aadmi ne uskaa rape bhi kiya tha
 Nafisa had also told me that at one time there was such a situation that she was destined to eat just one time a day
 ye sab sunne ke baad uske liye meraa pyaar or bad gaya tha
 Nafisa needed respect from her family and love as well as from the people around her
 main aisa nahin kar sakaa
 However, i did more than what a 21 year old boy could do
 wo har raat ko roti thi
 Ever since i came into her life she could not live alone
 wo aksar mere ghar aa jaaya karti thi
 Papa had reservations about coming to Nafisa's house
 
 
 nafisa kii sexi image ke chalate shuruyaat main papa ko is tarah se uskaa aana pasand nahin tha, lekin jab maine unhen usase milwaaya to unhen nafisa ke ghar aane se koi dikkat nahin thi
 For my film, i used to attend many classes from 8 in the morning to 8 in the evening, but he did not have full faith in me although i had full faith in him
 main kabhi kabhi apane sar se uski baat karaata tha or usko vishwaas dilaataa tha ki main class main hi hum
 There was a time when she used to go with me to my class too, i did not have any problem with this
 samajhane kii puri koshish kithi maine
 
 
 One day i sat with it and said, 'nafisa, you know that i am an Indian boy
 main apane parivaar main bahut kuch dekh chukaa hum
 i am trying my best to take care of you
 tum roj mere saamne roti ho
 i am 4 years younger than you tumne mujhe apane bare main jo kuch bhi bataaya he uske baavjood main tumse pyaar karata hum
 You start believing me
 main apane maa-baap or bahan se zyada tumse pyaar karata hum
 If i don't see you for 3 days, my love will only grow for you
 'pehle bhi suicide karne kii koshish kar chuki thi nafisa
 
 
 She has cried every night except 3 nights in 7 months
 uskaa or meraa janmdin manaane ke liye ek baar ham goa gaye the
 She had a problem with depression and had also undergone counseling
 usne mujhe bataaya ki isse pehle bhi vah faansee lagane kii koshish kar chuki he
 i still respect his mother
 kaash main unase puch saktaa ki kya unhen sach main aisa lagata he ki maine nafisa ke saath kuch galat kiya
 Suraj was unaware of Nafisa's pregnancy
 
 
 ek din usne mujhe bataaya tha, 'suraj, mujhe period nahin ho rahe hai
 Can we go to the doctor? We went to the doctor and he gave Nafisa a pill and said that it would make all the right
 ham waapas ghar gaye or sab kuch normal tha
 When the police asked his family doctor if i was there at the time of abortion, the doctor refused
 police ne mujhase poocha or maine kaha, 'sar, hamaare bich shaareerik sambandh the
 He did not tell me about his pregnancy
 agar ye sabit ho jaataa ki ye meraa he main ise apana letaa
 Otherwise it is not mine, i cannot say anything about it
 'kyon hua tha brake-ap?nafisa kii maut se ek maheene pehle wo mere ghar par subah 8 baje rote hue ai thi
 He told me, 'I have a fight with my mother
 ' uske haath par chot ke nishaan the
 i left her with my friend Karan and went to meet her mother without telling her
 maine uski maa se poocha, 'antee, kya aapkaa nafisa se jhagada hua he? kya aapane use maaraa he?' unhone mujhase kaha, 'nahin, maine apni beti ko kabhi nahin maaraa
 'I told Nafisa's mother that i am not going to come between them but just want to tell them that their daughter's condition is not good and she needs medical assistance and their help
 main apni taraf se uski madad karne kii puri koshish kar rahaa tha
 Her mother told me, 'son, she does this just to get attention
 yahaan aane ke liye shukriya
 Her ex boyfriends had also left her but she would not commit suicide
 wo aisa 11 saal kii umr se karti aa rahi he,' maine nafisa se kaha ki main uski maa se mila
 She went to her house and a message came to me from her mother's number, which said, "sooraj, i don't want you to be with my daughter
" ' main nahin chahta tha ki meri vajah se nafisa or uski maa ke bich koi dooriyaan aae
 Apart from this, i was fed up with the daily crying of Nafisa
 maine usko bolaa ki main ab or ye sab nahin jhel paaungaa or uske saath baatcheet kam kar di
 20 days before his suicide, we had very little conversation
 suraj or nafisa ke bich aakhri baat
 
 
 She called me on Saturday (june 1) before committing suicide on Monday (june 3) and said, 'I am going to Hyderabad
 vahaan mujhe ek film mil rahi he
 i want to spend the Sunday with you before that
 ' maine use kaha ki thik he, lekin main phir se judaai kaa dard nahin jhelana chahta tha, isliye ye ravivaar hamaara saath aakhri ravivaar hoga
 i sent him a bouquet on Monday morning
 jis par likhaa hua tha, 'all the best
 He called me again on Monday evening and said, 'I want to meet you
 ' maine kaha, 'main tumse nahin mil saktaa hum
 'and i messaged him,' Nafisa, don't do that
 ' or maine apana phone of kar diya
 That was the last time i spoke to him
 papa ne bataaya tha nafisa kii khudakushi ke bare main
 
 
 2 hours later my father told me about his suicide
 jab nafisa kii maut hui to papa mujhase zyada roe the
 He felt that he could help her more
 unhen nafisa kii sari takalifon ke bare main pataa tha
 His death was not a 'shock' for me, but when i entered his building, i had to cry, i used to go there to take him
 abhi bhi karata hum nafisa se pyaar
 
 
 i still miss her
 mere ghar main har cheez uski yaad dilaati he
 She was beautiful both inside and outside
 use apni jindagi main acchhee chizon ke aane ke liye intjaar karnaa chahie tha
 She did not correct that she left me like this
 main uski madad nahin kar paaya
 There has been a change in my life that my love for my parents and sister has increased
 main hameshaa se shant insaan rahaa hum lekin ab mere andar agar 5 percent gussa tha to wo bhi ab khatm ho gaya he
 i do not mind that my name will be associated with him throughout my life
 main aaj bhi usase pyaar karata hum

 (input- ieenes) CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury, who failed to get the proposal to face the BJP in collaboration with the Congress at the party's central committee meeting, is not disappointed
 ab vah isi saal april main hone vaale party ke rashtriya adhiveshan main is prastaav ko paas karaane kii koshish karne vaale hai
 However, he has said that this should not be called his defeat, as CPM has a tradition of elaborate debate on any subject
 haa, unhone kendriya samiti kii baithak main apane prastaav ke 31 ke mukaable 55 maton se khaarij ho jane par apana istipha dene kaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 On this matter, he says that it is not right for him to continue in office if his proposal is rejected, but the party's central committee felt that the message should not go that there was a split in the CPM about the Congress
 unhone kaha ki iske alaava tripura main chunaav bhi hone the or party nahin chaahati thi ki in chunaavon se pehle aisa koi kadam nahin uthaaya janaa chahie
 Yechury believes that by presenting such a proposal, he should not be considered to be inclined towards the Congress
 unhone kaha he ki chunaavon main ranneetik taiyaariyon ke saath utarana chahie
 Yechury says that the party's first objective is to remove the existing forces (BJP) from power
 padhein-kya prakaash karat duusari sabase badi raajnneetik bhul kar rahe hai?times of india ko die intervyuu main yechuri ne party main saidhantik or vyavhaarik marxvad main pratidwandvita par bhi apni baat rakhi he
 He has said that Marxism is a creative science for him
 unhone kaha he, 'marxvad kii khubsuurati vibhinn paristhitiyon kaa thos vishleshan karne main he
 If the circumstances change, then you also have to change your analysis at the same pace
 agar aap nahin badalenge to aap marxvaadi nahin rah jaaenge
 i think a Marxist should be ready for change
 'yechuri kaa kahana he ki aaj desh ko netaa nahin niti kii jarurat he
 He said that while the vote share of BJP declined by 11 per cent in the Gujarat Assembly elections, there was no clear alternative policy before the public
 unhone kaha ki congress kii nitiyon kii vajah se hi aaj bijepi satta main he
 Yechury also said that a PM has to present an alternative policy in front of the people
 media report main kaha gaya he ki jila prashasan ke adhikariyon ne chaatr samoohon ke bich hone vaale sangharshon kii jaanch karte hue paaya ki jati ke aadhaar par chaatro ko nishaanaa banane ke liye kalai par baandhe jane vaale band kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he

 The police have alleged that Subhash was beaten up in the post, due to which he died

 With great difficulty, the police force reached the spot and controlled the situation

 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne ajtak channel ke sidhi baat kaarykram main hedlins today ke managing editor rahul kanwal se baatcheet kii
 Excerpts from the conversation
 aapaki sarkaar kaa ek saal puraa ho gaya
 Mr
 Chief Minister, you have failed to fulfill your promise
 kanya dhan, berogari bhatta jaisi kuch aisi uplabdhiyaan hai, jo hamaari sarkaar ne puri kii hai
 There was also a laptop, which we have started
 jahaan tak kanoon vyavastha kaa sawaal he to aisa lagata he ki sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon ko chupaane kaa prayaas ho rahaa he
 And anyway, when the party comes to power, it is alone and any incident is exaggerated and shown
 yah sajeesh nahin he
 i keep the figures in front
 aap mukhyamantri bane, uske baad pichley ek saal main uttar pradesh main 27 dange hue hai, 380 logon kii kidnaping hui he, 814 rape hue hai, 2,257 murder hue
 i remember when the elections were going on, the Bahujan Samaj Party was keeping figures among the people and the figures were being kept that the law and order of Uttar Pradesh is better than the rest of the states
 unhone udhaaharan dilli kaa bhi diya or anya suubon kaa bhi or yahi aankade aapke saamne aa rahe hai
 You are talking about 27 riots
 ye dange nahin hue
 When you will go into the truth and know that those who are caught, they belong to which political party
 kuch tulana karata hum
 In May, when Mayawati was in government, 326 rapes took place
 2012 main aapaki sarkaar main 1,036 cese aae
 It is a fact that people felt more secure in Mayawati's rule
 maine vidhansabha main is baat ko kaha he ki pichhali sarkaar main exiar darj hi nahin hoti thi
 i myself slept in the police station, then the Leader of Opposition, who is now the Minister of Public Works, slept in the police station
 do din lagaataar samaajawaadee party ke logon ke baithne ke baad bhi exiar darj nahin hui
 This is the truth
 aapke rishtedaar hai abhinav gupta, jinhone apni uniwarsity teacher ko tamaacha maaraa or teacher kii galati yah ki unhone atendence kam hone par ejams main na baithne kii baat kii
 When the teacher went to the police station to register an FIR, then Inspector Vijaymal Singh Yadav ran away, knowing that Abhinav was from Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh's family
 inaki exiar darj kaise kar sakate hai
 You know this much
 abhinav ke saath teacher kaa jhagada hua or vah exiar darj karwaane gai
 i met the teacher
 or teacher ke pitaaji mujhase khud vidhansabha main mili the
 i myself had heard their complaint
 puri karrwai kii he
 Abhinav has been removed from the university and has taken action that could have been taken
 par pulisavaale kaa khauf dekhie
 If you see, an FIR has been registered and it has been directed that there will be no laxity in the FIR case from the government
 dikkat andar se he
 Figures from the Association of Democratic Reforms show that 26 out of 48 ministers are those who have some criminal case, but you have kept people who are giving wrong messages
 jin mantriyon par mukademe hai, unamem se kai aise log hai, jin par rajnatik mukademe hai
 Let me give the example of Amaramani
 kehane ko to ve jail main hai, jail main unki sabha chalati he
 It seems like a court jail se jab chahen esayuvi main baithte hai, jail kii gaadi main nahin baithte
 He was given permission to go to the hospital only
 jo dhilaai hui, us par karrwai hui he
 It is alleged that Uttar Pradesh is one, but there are many Chief Ministers
 aap mukhyamantri hai, lekin kuch maanate hai ki aap to keval mukhauta hai
 The real faces are Azam Khan, Shivpal Yadav and your father
 yah sawaal kai baar poocha gaya he
 Any government can run only when the Chief Minister is one
 ek saal ke andar sarkaar kii itani uplabdhiyaan hona, kisi bhi pradesh se behatar kaam karke dikhaanaa, jab tak nirnay ek nahin hoga, tab tak sambhav nahin he
 You feel that you are in command, but your father often criticizes your ministers
 aapke pita aapako fail maanate hai
 See, criticizing someone or asking someone to improve is a different thing
 or agar kisi ke madhyam se unako yah jaankaree milti he or ve is baat ko bataate hai to isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 You know Beni Prasad Verma quite well
 unhone mulaayam singh ke khilaaf bayaan diya ki unka aapraadhik jivan rahaa he, aatankwaadiyon se unka rishta he, tihaad main jane kii taiyaari kar leni chahie
 They take commission from Congress
 umr ke hisaab se mujhe unke liye kuch nahin kahana chahie, lekin jo kuch bhi unhone kaha, vah galat he
 And his opposition has also come from his own party
 unki party ke logon ne mana he ki unki bhashaa acchhee nahin thi
 But then all of you were saying that Beni should resign or else we will leave the government
 par ain vakt main congress se deal ho gai
 Benny is still there
 sarkaar ke varisht netaaon ne sweekaar kiya or maine to kai netaaon ke statements kii ninda bhi kii ki shabd kharaab the
 The DMK split from the government
 par mayawati or mulaayam kii jugalbandi hameshaa sarkaar ko bachaati rahegi
 What a strange relationship
 sadakon par itnaa ladate hai, phir bhi congress kii madad karte hai
 It is the quality of Congress that it is able to take the support of both the parties which fight in UP
 congress kii khubi yaa phir sibiai kii
 i think the Congress has its merit
 aapke anusaar april-may 2014 main chunaav honge yaa november-aktubar main
 Samajwadi Party is ready whenever elections are held
 samaajawaadee party ke liye agar april main chunaav ho to behatar
 They are ready even if done first
 ek taraf narendra modi kaa cheharaa najar aa rahaa he
 Do you think that BJP can get that government? His name is being discussed in TV and Gujarat
 uttar pradesh main jameen par to kahin charchaa nahin
 You are frightened because there is a buzz that Modi can contest elections from Lucknow too
 maine kaha ki charchaa keval tivi par ho rahi he or tivi ke madhyam se tikat tay ho jaataa he
 What is your guess If elections are held, what kind of government will be formed? We can say that the role of Samajwadi Party will be important
 uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party kii sankhya zyada aegi
 Whose government will be formed, it is difficult to say
 kabhi lagata he ki teesri takat bhi taiyaar ho sakati he
 Your father made you Chief Minister
 ab aapkaa praytn hoga ki aap unhen pradhanmantri banaaen
 The PM can be the one who has the numbers, the support of the parties, but as far as Netaji is concerned, it is my responsibility for the Samajwadi Party, the national leadership that the Samajwadi Party should win by winning more seats
 agle saal aapaki kya praathamiktaayen hongi? kya karenge?uttar pradesh desh kaa sabase bada pradesh he
 The priority of the Samajwadi Party will be that there should be development in all things, roads should be better
 padhai kaa intjaam behatar ho, swasthya or ilaaj kaa intjaam behatar ho
 The way the environment for investment and industry has been created, it is also the policy of Samajwadi Party

 He says that he has an old relationship with the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 aalia bhatta kaa rishta apni badi bahan shaheen se behad khaas rahaa he
 These two sisters have been each other's biggest supporter since the beginning and never lag behind in praising each other
 aaj aalia kii badi bahan shaheen bhatta apana 31waan janmdin manaa rahi hai
 In such a situation, Alia has tried to write a beautiful note for him
 apane bachapan kii photo share karte hue aalia ne likhaa ki kaise unhen bahan ke bare main likhane main dikkat ho rahi he, kyonki ve apni feelings ko shabdon main kaise piroe ye unhen samaj nahin aa rahaa he
 Alia wrote in a very funny and emotional post: 'this is the time when i am trying to write a perfect birthday caption for my sensible sister
 main tip karti hum phir delit kar detii hum
 This is because firstly i am not a good writer like my sister and we use such language among ourselves which others will not understand
 jo rishta hamaare bich he usamen koi bhashaa he hi nahin
 
 
 Only our eyes speak
 
 
 or hamaare pair, acha shaayad ghutane bhi
 
 to haa, ham duniya kii sabase pyaari bahan ho or main khush hum ki hamaari billiyon, aalu frai or dher saare landan ke saath hamaara apana ek swarg he
 i hope to keep rocking together as long as our hands and feet are safe
 oh or happy berthde
 'view this post on Instagram Now here's that moment where I'm struggling to type that perfect birthday caption for my brilliant sisters birthday
 
 i type i cancel i type i cancel
 
 And the reason i do that is (well for starters I'm not a beautiful writer like her) but also cause we speak a language that would probably not make sense
 
 The relationship we share is a language that does not exist
 
 except for in our eyes
 
 and toes okay and mayb xxrep 4 e our knees
 
 So anyway
 
 Sir
 
 You're the sweetest artichoke the pudding of Naples has seen cause eventually we all just have to bobble our way through the heavens of sisterhood and I'm glad we've had the little nook of heaven with cats and aloo fry and tons of london ! Happy birthday sweet carrot i hope we yoddle together for as long as we have arms and leggies :) Oh and happy birthday 😀🙂❤️A post shared byalia ☀️ (@aliaabhatt) onnov 27, 2019 at 11:44 am PST on this post by Alia Bhatt His Bollywood friends including his mother Soni Razdan have commented

 desh main ek saath loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav karaane kii bhartiya janata party kii ummiido ko chunaav ayog se jhatka laga he
 The Election Commission says that there are not so many vvpats in the country to hold 11 state assembly elections and Lok Sabha elections in the country simultaneously
 mukhya chunaav ayukta opi ravat ke mutabik, agar 11 rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav or loksabhaa chunaav ek saath karwaane hai to is par agle ek-do maheene main hi faisla lenaa hoga
 Because for this a lot of new VVPAT machines have to be ordered
 iske alaava chunaav ayog kii ore se ye bhi kaha gaya he ki saal ke ant main hone vaale 4 rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav ke saath bhi loksabhaa chunaav nahin karwaae ja sakate hai
 Meanwhile, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has also given a statement on one country-one election
 unka kahana he ki abhi kii paristhiti main ye sambhav nahin he
 The BJP was preparing to hold elections of several states together
 It may be that the Modi government and the Election Commission may have constitutional problems in holding the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections together under 'one country one election', but according to BJP sources By holding assembly elections of a dozen states with Lok Sabha in 2019, one country can set a great example in the direction of one election
 bijepi ke sutron ke mutabik iske liye kisi tarah ke samvidhan sanshodhan yaa chunavi niyamon main koi bada sanshodhan karne kii jarurat bhi nahin padegi
 But now after the reply of the Election Commission, the question mark has been raised on these speculations

 The color of Bengal, once a stronghold of left-wing parties with red flags, is changing rapidly
 rajya main ab bhagava kahe jane vaale raajnneetik dal bijepi kaa ubhaar saaf taur par dekha ja saktaa he
 The pace of this change in state politics has intensified after the 2016 elections
 haal yah he ki kabhi vam dalon ke samarthak rahe log or unke kaaryakarta hi ab bijepi kii sharan main jane lage hai
 In the last assembly election, BJP was fourth in Bengal
 lekin isi party ne iske baad hue kooch bihar ke upachunaav main congress or vam ummidavaaron ko bhi peeche chhodte hue doosraa sthaan hasil kar liya
 In all the previous elections, whether it is a by-election or a panchayat election, the BJP has emerged as the second largest party in the state everywhere
 kooch bihar main upachunaav se hi yah saaf ho gaya tha ki matadatatiemasi kevikalp main ab congress yaa vam dalon kii jagah bijepi ko chun rahe hai
 This became clear in the last few elections
 bijepi ko hasil voton ke pratishat main lagbhag utani hi badhotaree dekhi gai, jitani kii makapa (CPI-M) ke vot main giravat ai
 If the electoral data is analyzed, it would appear that a very small proportion of the voters who voted for the Left parties have gone to the TMC, while a large part of it has gone to the BJP
 bijepi ko phaayde kii vajaysal main makapa ne to nabbe ke dashak se hi apane samarthakon ko is tarah se prashikshit kiya tha ki ve tiemasi kaa virodh karte rahen
 Therefore, TMC always had an image of an opposition party in their mind
 saal 2011 main satta se baahar kar die jane ke baad makapa apana aadhaar barkaraar nahin rakh pai or uske netaa sirf apana raajnneetik aadhaar banane main lage rahe
 While in power for a long time, the CPI-M did not understand the need to strengthen the organizational structure and depended on the administration
 isi vajah se satta se baahar jane ke baad unka aadhaar bikhar gaya
 The color of the sign board of All Trade Union has also started changing due to the changing political color in the state
 jo thode bahut kattar makapa samarthak bache hai, un par hamale ho rahe hai or unke raajnneetik aakaa unka bachaav nahin kar paa rahe
 So this desperate group has finally joined BJP
 bengal main ab mukhya vipaksh kaa rang bhagava ho gaya he
 The game of state politics has started changing

 bataaya jaataa he ki centre kii asantushti ke baad mufti sarkaar ne yah vistrut report bheji he
 According to sources, earlier the central government was also not satisfied with the report sent again in the case
 lihaaja, is bare main centre ne kuch or safai maangi thi
 According to the information, the Center has sought more information from the Mufti government about the entire incident and its circumstances
 masarat kirihaai kaa maamla centre kii modi sarkaar ke liye bhi museebatabanata ja rahaa he
 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday that the government was not satisfied with the clarification given by the Jammu and Kashmir government on the release of separatist leader Masrat Alam
 tab centre ne jammu-kashmir sarkaar se is maamle par nai report maangi thi, jiske baad jammu-kashmir sarkaar ne teji dikhaate hue masarat maamle main kendriya grih mantralay ko duusari report saunpi thi
 Significantly, the state government released Masrat Alam on Saturday 8 March
 wo baraamula jail main band tha
 After this release, opposition parties not only targeted the Center but also raised questions on the nationalist ideology of Narendra Modi
 loksabhaa main bhi masarat maamla jamkar gunja, jiske baad piem modi ne loksabhaa main jawaab dete hue kaha ki alam kii rihaai se desh ke aakrosh ke swar main vah apana swar milaate hai
 Modi said that the Jammu and Kashmir government had not taken any advice from the central government in this matter
 bharat sarkaar ko is bare main koi jaankaree nahin thi
 Modi said in the House, 'don't teach us any patriotism
 ye kisi dal kaa nahin puure desh kaa aakrosh he
 There is no difference between terrorism and separatism
 aisi koi bhi harakat sweekaar nahin kii jaaegi
 ' maharashtra main congress-ensipi ke bich kii daraar or chaudee hoti dikh rahi he
 This time the reason is the election of the Legislative Council
 is chunaav main 10 june ko vot padane hai
 In this election, the Legislative Council candidate has to vote for the Member of the Legislative Assembly
 chunaav kii ranneeti tay karne ke liye mumbai main bulaai gai baithak main congress vidhayakon kaa ensipi ko lekar gussa foot padaa

 Out of these 3 seats, NCP is claiming 2 seats

 NCP state president Sunil Tatkare has announced that the two parties will contest this election together
 tippaniyan State Congress Chief Vip Abdul Sattar, while talking to media persons after the Mumbai meeting, reiterated the question of voting for the NCP candidate

 Is this justice of yes? darasal, ensipi ne avishvaas prastaav laakar congress ke varisht netaa shivajirao deshmukh ke khilaaf vidhaan parishad ke sabhapati ke pad se bedakhal kiya tha
 There is a lot of resentment among Congress mlas over this act of NCP
 yah bhi ek or vajah he ki zyaadaatar vidhayak aagaamee vidhaan parishad chunaav main ensipi ko do seat dene or unke ummidavaar jitawane ke paksh main nahin hai
 Congress legislators got angry over NCP in a meeting convened in Mumbai to decide the election strategy
 maharashtra pradesh congress adhyaksh ashok chavaan kii adhyakshata main hui is baithak main vidhayak yah sawaal uthaate sune gaye ki aakhir koi congressi kyon ensipi ummidavaar ko vot de? Based on the accumulated strength of congress-ncp, only 3 candidates can win in the elections for 10 seats of Maharashtra Legislative Council
 in 3 siton main se 2 siton par ensipi daawa kar rahi he
 Despite being a smaller party than the Congress on the basis of numbers, the NCP is firm on its claim, leading to anger over this claim in the Maharashtra Congress
 ensipi ke pradesh adhyaksh sunil tatakare yah elaan kar chuke hai ki donon dal yah chunaav ek saath ladenge
 The comments pradesh congress ke chif vip abdul sattaar ne mumbai kii baithak ke baad mediakarmiyon se baatcheet karte hue ensipi ummidavaar ko vot dene kaa sawaal doharaaya
 He also said that the strength of NCP is less than the Congress
 usamen se do ensipi vidhayak jail main hai
 In this case, NCP has two seats and Congress only one seat

 ensipi kii is karatuut par congress vidhayakon main baari naaraazgi he
 This is also another reason that most of the mlas are not in favor of giving NCP two seats and winning their candidates in the upcoming Legislative Council elections

" pashchimi samaaj main samasya yah he ki vah itnaa parishkrut he ki vah neeche dabe pade bhuuchaal ko sweekaar nahin kar paata

 Where is the crux of the matter Women scientists know that even though the increase in the salary-allowance figures may be a big social indicator, it is quite different in the blueprint for women
 mahila shiksha par rashtriya samiti ne is kshetra main mahilaon ke bare main apni pehali chintaa 1959 kii durgabai deshmukh samiti kii report main jaahir kii thi
 After that the Five Year Plans looked at women from the perspective of development

 He classified discrimination against women in Indian science as hierarchical retrenchment, that is, as a 'leaking pipe' or as women getting out of it as they rose to seniority; And another as horizontal segregation, ie the complete absence of women from certain areas

 The nature of discrimination that the traditions dictate to the nature of Indian women, is itself contrary to the feelings which are rooted in the nature of science
 raman research faillowship hasil karne vaali or central ledar research institute (sielarai) main biophigist chemist aruna dattatreyan ne 2014 main likhe mahila vigyaniyon ke sankalan leelavatij dotrs (jise ram ramasvami or rohinee godbhole ne sampadit kiya) main kaha, ''mahila se vinamr or koi sawaal na karne kii apeksha kii jaati he
 Even when women are allowed to study and work, even then they impose some roles on them

 Dattatreyan credits her husband, who is a chemist herself, for her perseverance in the field of science, and who was fully involved in raising children

 Charusita Chakraborty, a Chemical Physicist at iit-delhi and a Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award winner in 2009, underscores the friend group nature in all scientific pursuits, "if for some reason you cannot effectively adjust yourself within the scientific community
" So you will not be able to generate ideas in such a powerful way
 aap unhen prabhavi rup se saamne nahin rakh paaengi or aapkaa asar swatah kam ho jayega
 Since you will not be considered more effective, therefore your claim to leadership role will also be reduced
 ''is lihaaj se 'old boij club' mahilaon ko un kaaryon se alag kar dete hai jo gyaan kii bhagidaari or avasar milane ke liye jaruri hai
 Shubha Tole, who won the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in 2010 and neuroscientist at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, remembers meetings in which she was not even allowed to do her part
 tole yaad karti hai ki kaise 'ati-mahatvakankshi' or 'aakraamak' hone kii vajah se unhen kai panelon main shaamil nahin kiya gaya jabaki yahi baaten kisi purush vigyaani ke liye gun maani jaati hai
 Sujata Ramdorai, professor of maths at TIFR and winner of the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in 2004, says that she has survived the kind of direct gender discrimination that others face
 ve bataati hai ki old boij club kaa tohfa 'saamaan peeth thokna or parsparik saraahna' hota he, uskaa asar bada gambhir hota he
 a Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award winner told that this award changed his life as he was not even given a chance to complete his presentation before he met
 aakhirkaar, unhone apane kaam ko videsh bhejnaa shuru kar diya, jahaan unhen gambhirtha se liya gaya or natijatan unhen apane desh main bhi uske baad pahchaan mili
 Science becomes an alternative choice for women in these situations
 2010 kii ienese-iees report ke anusaar vigyaan anusandhan main aane vaali mahilaon main 14
 1 percent never marry, while this figure is only 2 for men
 5 fisadi he
 46 in women
 8 fisadi hafte main 40-60 ghante kaam karti hai jabaki purushon main 66
 5 percent work for fewer hours
 isi tarah sirf 19 fisadi purush vigyaniyon kii biviyaan bhi vaigyanik hai jabaki 40 fisadi mahila vaigyanikon ke pati bhi isi peshey main hai
 Things get a bit easier when someone becomes senior, Tolle says, partly because gender discrimination reduces the need to reconcile
 ve kahati hai, ''durbhaagya se bhedbhaav yuva peedi main bhi kaayam he lekin ab zyada se zyada mahilaayein saamne aane par use pahchaan leti hai or bahut kam hai jo use khamoshi se sweekaar kar leti hai
 "women in Indian science want to avoid the impression that they need any help or reservation
" isaki bajaae ve mahila hone ke dabaavon ko hi behatar tareeke se samajhe jane kii apeksha karti hai
 Support from men Many women scientists believe that despite discrimination, support also comes from within the male hierarchy
 venkatesh ne apane adhyayan main is baat kaa ishaara kiya he ki bhartiya vigyaan main lagbhag sabhi mahilaayein vigyaan main ruchi jagaane or use aage badhaane ke liye apane pita ko shrey detii hai yaa phir bacchon ke paalan-poshan main madad dene or jagahen badalane main saath dene ke liye pati ko
 Much cooperation has also been institutionalized for many women like Tole

 guruuvar ko dilli main jithan ram maanjhi ne kaha kii mistar clin kii image kii chaah rakhane vaale nitish kumaar ab sirf apni kursi bachaane main lage hue hai
 Manjhi said that to save power, Nitish Kumar could not muster the courage to sack Yadav
 jabaki tejasvi ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aarope hai
 Manjhi questioned that Nitish Kumar repeatedly talks about zero tolerance for corruption, then why is Tejashwi not being able to remove Yadav from his cabinet
 jithan ram maanjhi apnihindustani awam morchaparty ke iklaute vidhayak hai
 Manjhi said that his party wants that if Nitish Kumar breaks ties with Lalu Yadav's RJD, BJP should support Nitish Kumar's government to maintain political stability in Bihar
 bataa den ki bijepi pehle hi lalu yadav kaa saath chhodane par nitish kumaar ke samarthan kaa ofer kar chuke hai
 Talking about the political situation of Bihar, RJD has done it that Tejashwi Yadav will not resign at any cost
 vahiin jediu ne lalu yadav ko tejasvi par ection lene ke liye ultimatum diya he
 Nitish Kumar will once again meet JDU, after which any big action can be taken against Tejashwi Yadav

 The Railway Ministry had withdrawn the ticket following the rigor of the Election Commission amidst a ruckus after PM Modi's picture was on the railway tickets
 magar uttar pradesh main railway kii tikat par phir se piem modi kii tasviir najar ai he
 Just before the Lok Sabha elections 2019, Railways may have talked about withdrawing all tickets with PM Modi's picture, but tickets with PM Modi's picture and details of the government's plan are still available at the railway station in Barabanki city of Uttar Pradesh
 Huh
 barabanki railway stesan par railway aachaar samhita kii dhajjiyaan udaata najar aa rahaa he
 The latest case relates to the city of Barambaki, 30 km from Lucknow, where a man bought a ticket at the city's railway station on Sunday, which contained the photograph of PM Modi and details of the government scheme
 tikat ke ek bhaag par pradhanmantri awaas yojana kaa vivaran tha to duusare bhaag par piem modi kii tasviir maujuud thi
 Mohammad Shabbar Rizvi, the person who bought the ticket, told NDTV that 'he took the ganga-sutlej Express ticket from Barabanki to Varanasi
 jab unhone tikat ko dekha to unhen is par piem modi kii tasviir maujuud dikhi
 i know that the Code of Conduct is in force everywhere and in that sense it is not correct
 maine suparvizer se isaki shikaayat karne kii koshish kii, magar mujhe daant kar bhaga diya gaya
 Then i called some media people i knew
 'mohammad shabbaar rizvi kaa daawa he ki anya logon ko bhi isi tarah ke tikat jari kiye gaye or un logon ne bhi iskaa virodh kiya

 The National Investigation Agency (NIA) Special Court has sent farmer leader Akhil Gogoi to 10-day NIA custody
 NIA ne kisaan netaa akhil gogoi par analophul activities privansion amendament act (UAPA) ke tahat cese darj kiya tha
 Akhil Gogoi has been accused of inciting people to violence over the citizenship law
 naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon par akhil gogoi kaa rukh hameshaa se centre sarkaar ke khilaaf rahaa he

 Significantly, violence continues in many parts of the country regarding the citizenship law
 north-east ke kai rajyon or desh kii rajdhani dilli ke kai ilaakon main naagarikta kanoon ke khilaaf pradarshan jari he
 What is UAPA law? Under UAPA law, central government can declare any organization as an organization of its involvement or any kind of commitment in any case related to terror
 agar aatankwaad kii taiyaari, aatankwaad ko badhaava dena yaa aatanki gatividhiyon main kisi anya tarah kii sanliptata pai jaati he to karrwai kii ja sakati he
 Apart from this, the law also gives the government the right to declare anyone as a terrorist on the basis of it

 Madhuri Dixit has played many memorable characters in her career so far
 film tejaab main mohini, ham aapke hai koun main nisha, dil to pagal he main puja, devdas main chandramukhi
 Madhuri once again came out as Bahar Begum in the film Kalank, which is a beautiful tawaif
 is kirdaar kii jab se jhalak karan johar ne dikhaai darshak palken bichhaakar intjaar karne lage
 Lakhs of hearts began to clap
 lekin jab bahaar begum ain to laga ye jaise patjhad aa gai
 Madhuri's laughing eyes are extinguished
 hansi kii khanak kahin kafoor ho gai he
 More than glitter on the face is a reflection of makeup
 maadhuri ko phens ne hameshaa apni chulabuli harakat se ek do teen karaate dekha he
 i have seen that Madhuri who is so mad that she makes me crazy, she makes me crazy
 wo maadhuri jo devdas kii chandramukhi banati he to ankhon se katl kar detii he
 On 17 April, spectators arrived at Cinemahal to see the same magic of Madhuri
 kalank film main maadhuri to najar ain lekin wo gres gaayab tha
 By the way, the inking was attained by Madhuri's devastated song
 film kaa gaanaa tabah ho gaye dekhakar kisi bhi maadhuri fain kaa dil tuutane main chand minute bhi nahin lage
 But it is the team more responsible than Madhuri herself who worked on Madhuri's makeup and dress up in the stigma
 mechap ko dekhakar laga jaise cheharaa khubasurat dikhaane ke bajaay umr chhipaane kii koshish kii gai he
 Madhuri, who used to laugh blissfully, had a thousand restrictions on her laughter
 haa ek plastic smil jarur thi, jo maadhuri ke chehre par suut nahin karti
 View this post on Instagram Felt blessed playing a character so mysterious and enchanting
 Catch # bahaarbegum in # Kalank on 17th April
 
 kalanka post shared bymadhuri Dixit (@madhuridixitnene) onapr 15, 2019 at 3:18 am PDT Now let's talk about the look of Madhuri's dress in a lehenga and heavy jewelery but Royalty was missing
 wo charm nahin tha jo chandramukhi main tha
 In the song Ghar More Pardesiya, Madhuri's height seemed smaller than Alia
 aalia clasical dance karti jahaan khubasurat dikhin, vahiin maadhuri kaa jaadu berang najar aayaa
 In this film, Madhuri is wearing a wig, it is clearly known
 haalanki pehle bhi kai filmon main maadhuri ne wig or mechap kaa sahaara liya he
 Usually, the actress uses fake wigs and makeup
 lekin jab inkaa balance bigadataa he to parde par ye bhadda lagata he
 Seeing this clumsiness, why does Madhuri not take retirement now? Admittedly, the effect of age is on the face, there is no fault of Madhuri in this
 lekin 51 saal kii maadhuri main 25 saal vaala wo jaadu nahin rahaa, is baat ko maananaa bhi jaruri he
 Otherwise when did it happen that Madhuri came on screen and did not get beat
 lekin kalank ne maadhuri par wo grahan laga diya, jo bataata he maadhuri main ham aapke hai koun kii nisha, devdas kii chandramukhi, dil to pagal he ki puja ko talashna bekaar he

 The death of hospitalized children due to lack of oxygen gas cylinders at the BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur has shaken the entire nation
 har koi pariwaron ke dukh main shaamil he or doshiyon par kadi karrwai kii maang kar rahaa he
 Dr
 of the Medical College after the incident
 kapheel khan kaa naam saamne aayaa jisamen kaha gaya ki unhone mushkil samay main oxigen silendar mangavaaye or madad kii
 But now many new things related to Kafeel are coming out
 jo ki bilkul alag kahani darshaati hai
 Many in the medical college, less in private clinics and more in the medical college, have been surprised by media reports that show Kafeel as an angel
 jabaki sachai bilkul alag he
 Dr
 Kafeel is the Chief Nodal Officer of the Encephalitis Department of BRD Medical College but he is known for his private practice more than Medical College
 doston se lee madadunapar aarope he ki vaaspataal se oxigen silendarchuraakar apane nijee clinics par istemaal kiya karata the, jaankaree ke mutabik kapheel or principal rajeev mishra ke bich gahari sathganth thi or donon is haadase ke liye sabase zyada jimmedaar hai
 But since the accident, he was shown as an angel, it is said that he took the help of his journalist friends
 yogi ko kuch nahin batayadow
 Kafeel is a member of the Purchase Committee of the Medical College, he also had full knowledge about the status of oxygen supply
 2 din pehle jab siem yogi adityanath medical college ke daure par aae the wo bhi unke ird-gird gum rahe the
 But he too did not tell them anything about the outstanding amount of oxygen

 From there, he sent some cylinders to the hospital
 kyonki ye wo silendar the jo wo khud medical college se chori karke le gaye the
 He told the media that he had arranged these cylinders from his pocket, whereas there was nothing like this
 media main apane haq main banaaya maahaulek doctor jo khud parchez cameti kaa member ho wo aisa karne ke bajaay sarkari tareeke se pehle hi silendar kharid saktaa tha
 Even during the day when the media arrived, Kafeel repeatedly came out and started talking to the media, even though he is not authorized for it
 baaki doctoron kaa dhyaan bacchon kii dekhbhaal main tha, lekin kapheel kaa dhyaan media par tha
 The Muslim world has been divided into two parts with the proposal of removing the tomb of Muhammad Sahab from Medina and taking his remains to some unknown place
 england ke akhbaar da independent ne yah khabar di he
 The newspaper wrote that one of the holiest sites in Islam is al-masjid al-nabawi in Madina and there is the tomb of Prophet Muhammad
 masjid ke hare gumbad ke neeche paigambar ke avshesh hai
 Every year lakhs of pilgrims visit and express their respect
 ab saudi arab ke ek nami vidwaan ne prastaav kiya he ki us jagah se ki is jagah ko tod diya jaae or unke avshesh kisi agyaat jagah le jaakar dafna die jaaen
 There has been a lot of controversy with this proposal
 musalamaanon kaa ek bada tabaka is tarah ke kisi bhi prastaav kaa virodh kar rahaa he
 He says it would be wrong
 saudi arab ke hi ek anya vidwaan ne iskaa virodh kiya he
 He had opposed the demolition of the holy places of Mecca
 bataaya jaataa he ki us vidwaan ne apane 61 pej ke dastavej main kaha he ki mohammad sahab ke kabr ke aas-paas ke kaksh ko nasht kar diya jaae
 These chambers are very sacred to Shia Muslims and they go there in large numbers
 vahaan par mohammad sahab kii patni or betiyaan rahati thim
 The proposal states that the remains of Muhammad Sahab should be taken to a nearby al-baki cemetery and buried in an unknown place so that no one will know
 lekin shiya dharmavalambee is prastaav kaa jabardast virodh kar rahe hai
 He says that such a move will create dissatisfaction and have serious consequences
 al-masjid al-nabavi shiya or sunni donon hi ke liye bahut mahatv kaa tirth sthal he
 In fact, in Saudi Arabia's fundamentalist Islam, worship of such a place is clearly forbidden
 ve nahin chaahate ki us jagah jaakar koi prarthana kare
 He says that idol worship is forbidden in Islam and is a form of that
 isliye ve vahaan se mohammad sahab kii kabr hataa dena chaahate hai
 King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia is the custodian of the site and the final decision depends on him
 unhone bade jatan se masjid ke aas-paas ke ilaake kaa vikaas karavaaya tha

 bataaya ja rahaa he ki un sabhi ko nasht karne kaa prastaav he
 This document will now be considered
 ise vahaan kii masjidon kii dekharekh karne vaali samitiyon ke paas bhej diya gaya he
 Much has been published about these proposals in a magazine there

 These cereals are government, which were stored in warehouses for black marketing

 People allege that black marketing was reported to the District Supply Department several times earlier, but the Supply Department did not take any action, after which the police was informed
 is maamle main kai logon ko hiraasat main bhi liya gaya he
 An investigation has also started on who are the people behind this conspiracy
 afasaron kaa kahana he ki isaki bhi jaanch karaayi jaaegi
 The question is that while poor people are not getting food to eat, some people are earning big bucks by black marketing of the grain which is distributed to the poor on such a large scale, and why did the supply department remain oblivious despite the news? ovel test main bhartiya team kii sharmnaak haar ke baad captain mahendra singh dhoni ne kaha ki lagaataar mili naakamayaabi kaa asar team ke top order ke aatmavishvaas par padaa he jo dabaav jhelane main asafal rahaa
 He also blamed the lack of experience for the Indian team losing the five-match series 1-3 to England

 Dhoni said after losing the fifth Test innings and 244 runs, 'the top order felt pressure not to score

 It could have been better if the batsman played a little more carefully
 hamaare ballebaajon ne shuru se hi kharaab pradarshan kiya, haalanki nichle kram ne thodi madad kii
 This made the top order's performance a little hidden, scoring only 150-160 runs is not enough to defend against the home team
 'england ke halaaton ke bare main poochne par dhoni ne kaha, 'yah mushkil he lekin wicket acha tha, is par acchhee teji or oochaal tha
 In the cloudy conditions, the fast bowlers get swing
 'behatar pradarshan kii ummidadhoni ne haalanki ummid jataai ki unke yuva khilaadi is siries se sabak lenge or agali baar jab ve england aaenge to behatar pradarshan karenge
 The Indian captain said, "we have lost a lot of confidence during the five-test series
 yah niraashajanak he, lekin isamen kaaphi anubhav honge jise yuva khilaadi seekhenge
 Many of them have not played Test matches abroad and hope that they will use this lesson in future
 ''behatar ke liye sabakuch kiya'dhoni ne kaha ki apni team ko behatar karne ke liye vah kuch zyada alag nahin kar sakate the
 He said, 'we did everything we could
 agar ham rohit sharma ke saath khelte to mushkil yah thi ki ham kise baahar rakhte

 He said, 'the five-match Test series is very tough
 aap bhubaneshwar ko dekh sakate ho, us par asar padaa he lekin ham uski jagah kisi ko nahin de sakate

 To support Saryu Rai, the entire opposition is united in mobilization
 vichaar is baat par bhi chal rahaa he ki unhen samooche vipaksh kii taraf se ummidavaar bana diya jaae
 The question is, what is the strategy in Jharkhand for the BJP, which has not been able to achieve the expected success in the two assembly elections? Saryu Rai, who was part of Tarkhuvar Das Sarkar, the face of his own people, has stood up to the Chief Minister today
 mantriparishad or vidhansabha se istipha dene ke baad sarayu raay ne laav lashkar ke saath jamshedpur purv vidhansabha seat se namakan daakhil kar diya he

 Bollywood actor Rishi Kapoor has been in New York City, US for the past several months and undergoing treatment
 ab khabar he ki vah jald hi bharat lautenge or kisi bade project ke saath filmon main vaapasi karenge
 According to a Bombay Times report, Rishi Kapoor said that he is very desperate to make a comeback, as he has never been away from films for so long
 rishi ne kaha, "main camera ke aage aane ke liye or intjaar nahin kar paa rahaa hum, mujhe ummid he ki meraa filmon se tach chuta nahin he
 Hopefully i am still the same actor
 main takreeban ek saal tak filmon main kaam nahin karne ke baad vaapasi karuunga
 "rishi also stated that many filmmakers are making inquiries about his comeback but he has not yet committed to any film
 unhone kaha, "main tasalli se filmein karnaa chahta hum
 It is not that i have a problem or something has changed in me
 main vahi shaks hum, usee josh ke saath hum
 "" i want to come back and get in form first
 haa, jin do filmon ke liye maine pehle se kamitment kar diya he unhen to main puraa karuunga hi
 One is a film i left in Delhi and the other is a remake of a Bengali hit film
 yah ek bahut hi chunauteepurn role he
 "rishi told that many filmmakers have come to meet him, but he has not made any commitments to anyone yet
 ek baar mujhe meraa plan clear ho jaae or main mumbai laut aauun
 But first i will take some rest

 rajya ke mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ne haal hi main sonia gandhi ko chitthee likhakar kaha tha ki vah in halaaton main chunaav nahin ladenge or party ko bhi nahin ladane denge
 Virbhadra Singh is angry with the state Congress President Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu, who is considered close to Rahul Gandhi
 jiske baad virbhadra singh dilli aae, unki patiala court main aay se zyada sampatti ke maamle main patni ke saath peshi thi
 But speaking on Sonia's letter, it is a matter between me and the high command that it is clear that Virbhadra also wrote a letter and something is not right
 bataa den ki iske turant baad hi sonia gandhi ne apane raajnneetik salaahkaar ahamed patel ko gujarat se dilli bheja or dilli pahunchane ke baad buudhvaar ko ahamed patel ne virbhadra singh se lambii baatcheet kii
 Sources reveal that Virbhadra Singh has clearly stated that Sukhu, the state president, has to be removed, Sukhu, a close confidant of Rahul Gandhi, has been considered as the antagonist of Virbhadra Singh for many years
 aisa bhi kaha jaataa he ki sukkhu ko rahul gandhi kaa varad hast he chunki rahul gandhi ke is samay videsh main he, to is par abhi koi faisla karnaa sambhav nahin hai
 Nevertheless, Virbhadra Singh told Ahmad Patel that if Sukku does not withdraw, he will not change his decision
 virbhadra singh ke tewaron ke saamne abhi sonia gandhi jhukne ko taiyaar nahin dikhi, unhone bhi 2 din se dilli main ruke virbhadra singh ko milane kaa bhi samay nahin diya he
 However, the matter did not deteriorate, so Ahmed Patel did meet Virbhadra Singh but the question is the same, that Virbhadra is not ready for anything less than the removal of the state president, Rahul Gandhi is not in Delhi, Sonia is not tolerating such behavior of Virbhadra Is, so this case is stuck

 vakil abbaas kazmi ne ravivaar ko kaha ki vah islamic gymkhana ke nyaasi pad se unhen hataane ke gymkhana ke vivaadaaspad faisle ko adaalat main chunauti denge
 Gymkhana has taken this step against Kazmi for allegedly lobbying the Mumbai attacks accused Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab
 kazmi ne kaha ki yah faisla puri tarah gaiyrkanoonee he or nijee ranjish kaa parinaam he
 In April, Kazmi's appointment as trustee of the Islamic Gymkhana was canceled in April on the grounds that lobbying a terrorist was contrary to the spirit of Islam
 gymkhana ne kazmi ko bheje ek patr main likhaa he aapane sarvaadhik khoonkhaar aatankwaadi kasaab kii pairvi karne par sahmati jataayi he
 This is contrary to the spirit of Islam
 islam main aatankwaad ke liye koi jagah nahin he or kisi aatankwaadi kaa bachaav karne kii bhi koi gunjaaish nahin he
 In order to maintain the integrity of the Gymkhana, your position of trustee is dismissed
 kazmi ne kaha isamen raajnneetik badale kii bhaavana kii bu aati he
 Gymkhana is not a Muslim unit but a group of people
 kaise ve kah sakate hai ki kisi aaropee kaa bachaav karnaa islam ke viruddh he
 On social media, some people are spreading rumors that the ink used by the Election Commission to put on the finger while casting votes in the election is made from pig meat or its blood
 kaha ja rahaa he ki yah daawa nasa ke vaigyanik ne kiya he or yah vatican kii saazish he
 Taking cognizance of these rumors, the Election Commission has filed a case under IPC sections 505 and 171 (C) at the Parliament Street police station in Delhi
 yah cese 27 march ko darj hua he
 So far no one has been arrested in this case
 dilli police ne fasebuk or twitor ko patr likhakar aisi sabhi poston ko hataane ke liye kaha he
 The king of Bollywood can also be scared of anything

 'I have this secret fear that one nite while i am sleep walking i will eat up my kids

 jis skool main admician nahin mila, usee skool ne jab samvaad ke liye bulaayaa to manoj bajpeyi puri taiyaari main dikhe or sawaal-jawaab ke pehle apni baaten rakhin
 The occasion was an interface series organized under the 19th Bharat Rang Mahotsav
 is kaarykram ke tahat cinema main rangamanch se gaye abhinaytaon ko darshakon, enesdy ke chaatro or patrakaron se samvaad karne ke liye bulaayaa ja rahaa he or isse pehle navazuddin siddiqi ko bulaayaa gaya tha
 Significantly, during his struggle days, Manoj Bajpayee made several attempts for admission to NSD, but he failed
 unki yah kasak is dauraan bhi jhalki, lekin shikayati andaaj main nahin
 Manoj Bajpayee proudly mentions that the NSD did not give him a chance to study here, but invited him to teach
 padhaane ke liye paarishramik ke rup main mili check ko abhi tak manoj bajepayi ne sambhaal kar rakhaa hua he
 Why did NSD want to come? In response to this, Manoj Bajpayee said that 'getting admission in NSD would reduce a lot of their struggle, which they had to do while outside
 enesdy main behtareen rangakarmiyon ke saath training hoti thi to abhinay kaa jo craft hota he, usko taraashne main madad milti'
 If the admission was not received in NSD, Manoj joined the group 'sambhav' of NSD passout under the leadership of Devendra Raj Ankur
 'sambhav' kaa naatak 'apana morcha' behad charchit rahaa tha, jisamen manoj ne abhinay kiya tha
 Manoj Bajpayee definitely explains the discipline for the actor
 unka kahana tha ki 'maine jivan main anushaasan kaa paalan kiya he
 If you want to become an actor, then your morning should start with rehearsal and not with complaint
 ye aapaki jeevanstyli he, jisase aap kisi duusare vyakti yaa abhinayta se alag dikhte hai'
 The motivation of the actor must change
 jivan ke itane rup main kisi ek role model se kaam nahin chal saktaa, isliye unhone kaha ki abhinay kii maang ke aadhaar par mere role model badalte rahe hai'
 Describing the role of director as important for cinema or theater, he said that characterization has been a key point for me
 nirdeshak mere liye supreme he
 The actor should extend his vision with his work
 actor vah he jo nirdeshak ko niget na kare'
 The comments cinema kii seemaa bataate hue manoj bajpeyi ne desh main sensor board par chal rahi bahes par bhi apana mat prakat kiya
 He said that 'the censor board is very undemocratic, in a democracy like ours
 filmon ko ayuvarg ke anusaar rate karnaa chahie or board ko keval certificate dene chahie
 Parents are the best censors, if they do not work, then even the censors will not be able to do it
 is digital samay main sensor apana mahatv kho chukaa he'
 Manoj Bajpayee made a very important point that in cinema and dramas, we put a lot of emphasis on the word realism
 ham kairactor ko bhoolatey ja rahe hai
 There is a huge fraud going on in the country in the name of realism
 gauratlab he ki apane sangharsh ke dinon main manoj bajpeyi ne enesdy main admician ke liye kai prayaas kiye the, lekin vah naakaamayaab rahe
 His tightness was also reflected during this time, but not in a complaining manner
 manoj bajpeyi iskaa garv se ullekh karte hai ki enesdy ne unhen apane yahaan padhane kaa mauka nahin diya, lekin padhaane ke liye bulaayaa
 The check received as remuneration for teaching has been kept by Manoj Bajpayee till now
 enesdy kyon aana chaahate the? iske jawaab main manoj bajpeyi ne kaha ki 'enesdy main admician milane se unka bahut sara sangharsh kam ho jaataa, jo unhen baahar rahete hue karnaa pad rahaa tha
 If NSD were trained with the best color workers, then the craft of acting would have helped to shape it
 enesdy main admician nahin mila to manoj ne devendra raaj ankur ke netritv main chal rahe enesdy passout ke samooh 'sambhav' ko jwoin kiya
 The drama 'apna Morcha' of 'sambhav' was very popular, in which Manoj acted
 actor ke liye anushaasan ko manoj bajpeyi jarur bataate hai
 He used to say that 'I have followed discipline in life
 abhinayta bananaa he to aapaki subah reharsal se shuru honi chahie, shikaayat se nahin
 This is your lifestyle, which makes you look different from any other person or actor '
 abhinayta ko prerana badalati rahani chahie
 So much of life cannot work with a single role model, so he said that my role models have been changing depending on the demand of acting '
 cinema yaa theatre ke liye diarector kii bhoomika ko ahm bataate hue unhone kaha ki mere liye kairectorigeshan kii-point rahaa he
 The director is supreme for me
 actor ko apane kaam se uske vijan ko ekstand karnaa chahie
 The actor is one who does not swallow the director '
 tippaniyan Stating the extent of cinema, Manoj Bajpayee also expressed his opinion on the debate on the censor board in the country
 unhone kaha ki 'sensor board bahut aloktantric he, hamaare jaise loktantr main
 Films should be rated according to the age group and the board should only give certificates
 abhibhavak behtareen sensor hote hai, agar wo kaam nahin karte to sensor bhi nahin kar sakegaa
 Sensors have lost their importance in this digital time '
 manoj bajepayi ne ek bahut jaruri baat kahi ki 'cinema or naatakon main ham realism shabd par bahut jor dete hai
 We are forgetting the character
 realism ke naam par desh main bahut bada frod chal rahaa he

 As far as the question of Chidambaram's arrival and keeping him in jail is concerned, the jail does not have to make any special arrangements
 unhone kaha ki,' sab kuch jail minial ke hisaab se pehle se tay he
 Since Chidambaram is around 70 years old
 lihaaja kanuunan unhen jail number-ek kii cell main band kiye jane kii bhi prabal sambhaavna he
 Also, they will be given a wooden plank for sleeping, it is also certain
 saath hi unhen kambal bhi jail kii taraf se muhaiyaa karaayaa jayega
 There is no mention of air conditioner and mattress arrangements in the jail manual
 'ek anya jail sutara ne bataaya ki, 'jail number ek main kisi jamaane main harikishan laal bhagat (echkeel bhagat 1984 sikh dangon kaa aaropee), chandra swami, mamaji, purv kendriya mantri sukhram, san 2010 main dilli main yojit kaamanwealth games main fanse suresh kalmari, sahaara pramukh subrat raay bhi rah chuke hai
 Chidambaram's security will also be the main reason behind placing number one in Tihar jail instead of number 7 jail
 'naam jaahir na karne kii shart par tihaad jail ke ek aalaa afasar ne ieenes ko bataaya ki, 'yun to puri tihaad main tamilnadu special police lagi he
 The number of TSP jawans will be further increased as soon as Chidambaram arrives at Jail number one
 'jail minial ke hisaab se ek number jail main kaid hone vaale kaidiyon ko ek daal, ek sabji, chaar paanch roti muhaiyaa karai jaati hai
 Chidambaram will also be given to eat the same food
 alag hoga to sirf yah ki chidambaram ko jail number ek main hi maujuud alag rasoighar main bana bhojan muhaiyaa karaayaa jaae, na ki jail-lungar main bana khaanaa diya jaae
 All this is told according to the prison manual in view of precaution and security
 tihaad jail sutron ke mutabik agar chidambaram jail kii rasoi kaa khaanaa khaane se manaa karenge to unhen niyamanusaar tihaad jail canteen se hi kuch khaanaa mangane kii anumati hogi
 It is strictly prohibited to bring homemade food to the prison cell
 jail main ve sirf ghar se laae yaa kisi parijan dwaara muhaiyaa karaae gaye kapade hi pahan paaenge
 It is noteworthy that the court has sent Chidambaram on CBI remand for five days (till 26 August) on Thursday itself
 chidambaram tihaad jail kab bheje jaaenge yah 26 agast ko adaalat ke aadesh par nirbhar karegaa
 Meanwhile, IANS has come to know from highly placed sources in the CBI that, from Thursday night to 26 August, the former Home and Finance Minister, arrested on charges of economic scam, was arrested on charges of economic scam in one of the five furnished suites at the CBI headquarters (five Number)
 amuman in suites main sibiai ke adheekshak or usase upar str ke aalaa-afasar hi rukate hai
 It is a different matter that accused Christian Mitchell of agustawestland and Satish Sana, the other names in the case, were also kept by CBI in one of these suites
 sibiai mukhyalay sutron ke mutabik, 'bhu-tal par maujuud in khaas suites main asi, dabl-bed, frij, gijar, televijan jaisi tamaam suvidhaayen hai
 'however, these special suites only use CBI to keep white-collar criminals in remand period, while there is also a lockup for the dreaded criminals
 yahaan ullekhneey he ki adaalat ne remand avadhi ke dauraan chidambaram ke parivaar ko rojaanaa aadha ghanta unase milane kii anumati di he
 Also, the court has given instructions to the investigating agency to conduct a medical examination of the accused within 48 hours

 No one was killed in this fire and how much damage was done, it will be clear only after investigation

 agar leftinent karnal ne sochaa tha ki ek grenade se saare aatanki maare jaaenge to wo galat tha
 Four terrorists were injured inside the bunker and they also tried to attack

 The colonel then ordered a team of Indian para commandos waiting nearby to attack the terrorist camps vigorously
 uske nirdesh par special forces ke 21 commando ne rocket propeld grenade se apane nishane par 20 minute se bhi zyada vakt tak firing karte rahe
 The comments ab tak bhartiya commando ne jis camp par hamalaa kiya tha isaki jaankaree aatankiyon ko ho chuki thi or kareeb ilaake ke 10-12 banksron se bhartiya commando team par firing hone lagi

 My first "religious" memory is wrapped in death
 phir bhi yah un zyaadaatar chizon se zyada jeevant he jinhen main jaanata hum
 The image of this memory is a picture, a black-and-white picture, as it used to be in those times, of a man, an old man, of an agrarian figure lying on the floor
 vah safed kapade main lipta hua he, chaati khuli hui he
 People are mourning around
 vah
 How fast, in a moment, a man or woman turns into a "remnant", a "corpse"
 ''vah" ho jaataa he
 Vāsānsi jīrānā यī vīha vīhayānavāतिī griतितिi न naropārānitā शरीa sharirani vihaya jīrā्यyā्यानyānya sāyāti nāvānī dehī (just as a person renounces old clothes and wears new clothes, similarly the soul renounces the old body and replaces the new one
 )bhagavad gita main is bhavasaagar yatra kaa varnan is tarah kiya gaya he
 And the same has happened with this body
 mujhe bataaya gaya ki us samay main vahaan tha
 i was just three years old, but i don't remember anything
 lekin yah koi myne nahin rakhata, kyonki vah tasviir, jo gandhi kii hatya ke lagbhag ek ghante baad lee gai, mere dimag main sthaayee rup se ankit ho chuki he
 That lacquer is forever imprinted
 yah mere liye ek gahan dharmik pal, ek gahan hindu pal rahaa he or rahegaa
 i have gone to temples, i have heard discourses, read Hindu texts, but i have not gone through any such experience — in this case entirely in the window of my mind — when i felt so much more religious, more Hindu Ho, as much as that picture of a death, with that moment, which is about life, for me, about life and its restart
 is drishy ke saath hi mere dimag main ek sugandh, ek dhwani bhi basii hui he, sugandh agarbattiyon kii or dhwani prarthana kii
 i can hear people singing Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram in that picture
 yah vah geet he, jise gandhi ne chunaa tha, isamen allaah or ishwar kaa samavesh kiya tha or ise apni dainik prarthana samagam main shaamil kar liya tha
 My brain has put that fragrance and prayer song on the picture
 ek saath ve mere liye pehali dharmik smriti, meri pehali ''hindu" smriti or hindu hone ke bare main meri pehali jaagrukta kaa pratik hai
 This trilogy of a photograph, a fragrance and a song is related to an inter-connected sequence and the sequence is as follows: Gandhi was addressing his daily prayer meeting on January 20, 1948 in the Birla House complex in New Delhi
 , There was a prayer meeting — a mild explosion blasted the peace of the entire congregation
 gandhi nahin jaanate the, jaan bhi nahin sakate the ki yah visphot kyon hua, lekin gussai bheed se unhone kaha, ''suno, suno, suno sab suno
 
 
 Nothing has happened
 
 
 " or uske baad jab baichaiyn bheed kaa kolahal tham gaya, unhone kaha ki raghupati raghav raja ram gaaya jaae
 And everybody quiet, everybody silent
 yah visphot ek chote-se bam kaa tha, jise pakistan se aae ek yuva hindu sharnaarthi madanlaal paahwa ne phoda tha
 But this was not his only job
 vah us puure shadyantr kaa hissaa tha ki kis tarah se prarthana sabha main shor-sharaaba ho or uske baad afra-tafari or halle-hangaame ke bich gandhi kii hatya kar di jaae
 But Pahwa's conspirators quietly slipped away when he saw that Gandhi's wisdom skills and the maturity of the people present in the meeting did not create any chaos as he thought
 lekin
 Madurai Shanmukhavadiyu Subbulakshmi, popularly known as "MS" in Madras, about 2,000 km away in the evening of 30 January 1948, was suddenly listening to the devotional music of Sant Tyagaraja on the radio, when the program suddenly stopped and an announcement was made
 mahatma nahin rahe
 He was shot
 ek aise vyakti ne goli maari jise ek charampanthi hindu sanghathan se judaa bataaya gaya
 She was shocked to hear this, as thousands of people were surprised
 thodi der baad hi unhone usee radio stesan par apni hi aawaaj suni
 Immediately after this announcement on Akashvani, with great imaginativeness and similar reflexes, Subbulakshmi's Meerabai song was recorded which she recorded to Akashvani for Gandhi ji: Harri, tum haro jana ki bheer, some scholar jana ki bheer ki Pir also says, which means pain or agony in Braj
 yah puraa ek silsilaa he, jisaki shuruyaat ek visphot se hoti he jiske baad suno, suno kii aawaaj or phir shant hokar raghupati raghav gaanaa, uske baad 30 janvari ko teen goliyon kaa saamana or he ram! yah silsilaa khatm hota he subbulakshmi ke apni hi aawaaj main gitahari, tum haro jan kii bhirase
 This sequence is my personal departure point in the religion of my ancestors
 jis dharm ke bare main ve sochate or bolte the, saamaanya shabdon main kahen to dharm yaa ''jeene kii sahi paddati
 Did they call him the "hindu" religion? He used to say to me from my church, but when his ancestors or even his ancestors started using the word "hindu", i cannot tell
 is maamle main mujhamen gyaan kaa abhaav he, lekin main yah jaanata hum ki unhone kabhi bhi apni manyata ko dharm kahana band nahin kiya
 They may have used "hindu" as a pre-suffix or extension of religion, but it was religion, the right thing to do
 dharm unka dharmik siddhant tha, dharm uskaa dastur tha
 Religion was pre-existing manuals, scriptures and codes
 sarvapalli radhakrishnan bilkul uchit kehete hai, ''hindu dharm
 
 
 There is a combination of logic and intuition that cannot be defined, but only experienced
 
 
 "janvari 1948 ke silsile ke mul main sahaj-gyaan or anubhav kii ek aisi asaadhaaran dharmik shrunkhlaa he, jo asaadhaaran saundaryabodh or dharmik saundaryabodh kaa sangam he
 Violence was committed in a peaceful religious gathering, which in itself is an irreligious act
 or isaki pratikriya main prati hinsa nahin kii gai balki, sahaj-gyaan ke aadhaar par, or prarthana kaa aahvaan kiya gaya, jo hinsa ke bilkul vipareet he
 But the return of violence took place in a more correct and brutal way, so that the highest form of great prayer and non-violent religion could be fought
 yah maut kaa saakshaat anubhav tha jisamen ram kaa aahvaan bhi judaa tha, ishwar kii ichha ke aage samarpan karne kaa paripurna kaary, bina kisi asantosh yaa iljaam ke, ishwar se nivedan ki vah unka jivan, unki aatma or unka sab kuch grahan kare
 And then as Gandhi's physical body was waiting to merge into the Five Elements, "the daughter of Meenakshi, the goddess of Madurai", Saraswati's cult artist Subbulakshmi, in her own voice, was listening to the song that she heard of the entire humanity
 Sang, a song by Mewar's daughter Meerabai, in which she is requesting humanity to relieve fear, pain
 bhay
 Pain
 kis baat kaa bhay? kaisaa dard?hinsa ke atyaachaar kaa bhay, balashaali dwaara diya gaya dard
 Hari, Tum Haro Jan Ki Bhir Geet acknowledges the existence of tyranny, barbaric power and violence
 yah eemaandaaree or vinamrata se yah sweekaar karata he ki in sab kaa bhay maujuud he or dard maanav jivan kaa ek sach he
 In it, it is a matter of saving Draupadi from the lust of enemy rule, slaughtered by the almighty demon Hiranyakashyapa Narsinh, an avatar of Vishnu, saving an elephant from the claws of a crocodile, so it is a divine grace to uphold the superiority of moral force over physical force
 Is an example of
 dharm, hindu dharm, jaisaa ki main apni saadhaaran dharmik samaj se dekhtaa hum, yah kahata he ki vidwesh kaa astitv he, ek vrihad maujuudagi main or kisi vyakti dwaara uske pradarshan ke rup main
 Why and how disguise can be manifested by asuras, demons, "bad guys" is beyond comprehension
 jis vyakti ne prarthana sabha main bam phoda, bataaya jaataa he ki vah apane hisaab se apana dharm nibhaa rahaa tha
 The one who shot Gandhi, he said, believed he was fulfilling his religious obligation
 or gandhi jo nishchit rup se aisa kar rahe the, sahaj gyaan se or apane anubhav siddh gyaan se
 Then, whose religion was the right religion? Whose religion will be rightly called Hindu? This question is of dilemma
 chaalaaki bhare tark se aparaadh ko jaij tehraaya jaataa he
 It involves deceit with truth, distorting religion
 aparaadh kaa uske lakshya se muqabla nahin ho saktaa, na hi apradhi kii tulana peedit se kii ja sakati he
 Hatred is not a religious sentiment and murder is self-proclaimed irreligious
 nishchit rup se isamen kuch apwaad bhi he—aatmaraksha ke liye yaa kisi ko khatre se bachaane ke liye kii jane vaali hatya
 But this kind of murder is neither at the instigation of anyone nor at the behest of anyone
 yah to bas aadhaar hoti he
 Likewise, rape can never be religious, murder cannot be justified by the scriptures
 ghrinaa ko ek beemaari mana jaae to hatya ko bilkul patit kaary
 And genocide, terrorist or racial killings are purely vampiric acts
 krur hiranyakashyap, dusht dushshasan or magaramchh ke nukile jabadon kaa roopak vaastavik or samayik hai
 Religion and desire to gain grace for this is religion
 lekin jati ko dharmik sweekruti kii tarah dekhnaa ek tarah kii sanak he, dharm nahin
 Similarly, seeing bigotry in your creed is a kind of rebellion, not religion
 main arabi kaa vidwaan nahin hum or pavitra kuran kaa bhi gyaata nahin, lekin main maanata hum ki imaan dharm ke usee tarah se kareeb he, jaisaa ki vivek
 Who is saying all this, who experiences this? Simply put, i am
 ek hindu
 I, ordinary, negligible
 main, jisane koi bhi agam yaa veda nahin padhaa he, lekin jiske bheetar kisi bhi anya vyakti kii tarah vah he jise radhakrishnan ne ''dharmik sahaj gyaan" kaha he, jise hindu dharm kehete hai
 "freedom" is the greatest asset of Hinduism to any Hindu to define his own religion
 isi aazaadee kaa istemaal jab dharm ko ulat dene, todgaye-marodgaye ke liye kiya jaataa he to yah us sampada ko chori karne kii shaatir chalbaaji hi he
 To be religious, one has to become a good, right person, who is neither afraid of anyone's valor nor behaving like a fool
