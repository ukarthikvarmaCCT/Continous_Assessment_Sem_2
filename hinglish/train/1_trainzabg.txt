 40 varshiya tendulkar ne westeindies ke khilaaf haal main test shrinkhalaa main apana 200waan test match khilne ke baad antarrashtriya cricket se sanyas le liya tha lekin 38 varshiya kallis ab bhi maidan par date hue hai
 The South African all-rounder has played 164 Test matches so far
 kallis bhale hi test maichon main sarvaadhik ran, sarvaadhik shatak or 50 ran se adhik kii sarvaadhik pariyon ke tendulkar ke overol record se abhi kaaphi peeche hai lekin jahaan tak bharat or dakshin africa ke bich shrinkhalaa main in teenon record kii baat he to vah bhartiya ballebaaj se zyada peeche nahin hai

 The beginning began about two months ago when on 26 January women proposed that they want drug addiction in the village
 prastaav rakhane vaali sita devi ne kaha, "hamane ye maang rakhi ki daaru kaa theka band hona chahie
 Drunk men are dying, women are getting widowed, children are being orphaned
 auraton ke saath marpet hoti he
 They all knew, but no one spoke
 " This proposal of Sita Devi came out as a campaign
 gaanv kii mahilaon ne ye prastaav gram sabha main paarit karavaaya, phir baat jila colector tak pahunchi
 He sent the SDM to check the signatures on the proposal
 iske baad aabkaari vibhaag ko suchit kiya gaya or phir unki anumati lene ke baad jila prashasan ne daaru kaa theka band hona chahie yaa nahin is par matdaan karavaaya
 The voting took place under the supervision of SDM Narendra Kumar Jain
 panchayat chunaav kii tarj par yahaan 9 poling booth lagaae gaye or matdaan subah 8 baje se lekar shaam 5 baje tak chalaa
 Out of a total of 2886 voters, 2039 cast their votes, out of which 1937 sealed the contract for liquor
 aabkaari vibhaag ke niyamon ke anusaar agar 51% matadaata daaru kaa theka band karwaane ke liye vot daalate hai, tabhi ilaake se theka hataaya ja saktaa he
 The comments esadm narendra kumaar jain ne bataaya ki yah gaanv daaru or nashe se pareshaan tha
 There have been 84 deaths in the last 5 years due to alcoholism
 zyaadaatar log road accident main maare gaye hai
 'women and the younger generation have played an important role in this campaign of drug addiction
 isamen shaamil ek mahila khimi devi ne bataaya, "jab aadmi daaru kii lat paal letaa he to parivaar chalaane kii jimmedaari mahila par pad jaati he
 If she works as a laborer in one way or the other, she brings 100 rupees, then the man gets half the money after being reprimanded
 
 
 agar chaar bachche hai, to wo unka pet kaise bharegi?" Another woman Gattu Devi told that her husband died after drinking too much alcohol 5 years ago
 uske ilaaj main kharch hue 2 lakh rupee gattu devi ab tak mazdooree karke chukaa rahi he
 He said, "we do not want more women in this village to be widowed due to alcohol, so the contract of liquor should be closed here
" " But young leaders like Vijay Pal Singh, who are involved in this campaign, understand that the closure of Daru's contract will not solve the problem
 sharaab kii lat ko agar jad se mitaanaa he to samaaj sudhaar kaa bhi bidaa uthaanaa padegaa
 There are many challenges ahead, but by voting against liquor, the people of Kachabali village have set an example in democracy
 sita devi kaa ye prastaav ek muhim ke rup main saamne aayaa
 The women of the village got this proposal passed in the Gram Sabha, then the matter reached the District Collector
 unhone esadm ko bhejkar prastaav par kiye gaye hastakshron kii jaanch karwaai
 After this, the Excise Department was informed and after taking their permission, the district administration got a vote on whether the contract of Daru should be stopped or not
 matdaan esadm narendra kumaar jain kii nigaraanee main hua
 On the lines of the panchayat elections, 9 polling booths were set up here and the voting took place from 8 am to 5 pm
 kul 2886 matadaataaon main se 2039 ne vot daale, jinamein se 1937 ne daaru kaa theka band karwaane par apni muhar laga di
 According to the Excise Department rules, if 51% of the voters vote to get the liquor contract closed, then only the contract can be removed from the area
 tippaniyan SDM Narendra Kumar Jain said that the village was troubled by alcohol and drugs
 yahaan daaru ke kaaran pichley 5 saalon main 84 logon kii mautein hui hai
 Most of the people have died in road accidents
 ' nasha mukti ke is abhiyaan main gaanv kii mahilaon or yuva peedi kii ahm bhoomika rahi he
 a woman involved in it, Kheemi Devi said, "when a man takes care of liquor then the responsibility of running the family falls on the woman
 wo kisi na kisi tarah se mazdooree karti he, 100 rupee laati he, to mard daant-fatkaar kar aadhe paise le letaa he
 
 
 If they have four children, how will they feed them? " ek anya mahila gattu devi ne bataaya ki 5 saal pehle zyada sharaab pine se unke pati kii maut ho gai
 Gattu Devi is paying 2 lakh rupees for his treatment till now
 unhone kaha, "ham nahin chaahate ki is gaanv main or mahilaayein sharaab ke kaaran vidhwaa ho jaaen, isliye yahaan daaru kaa theka to band hona hi chahie
 " lekin is muhim main shaamil vijay paal singh jaise yuva netaa samajhate he ki daaru kaa theka band karne se samasya kaa hal nahin hoga
 If alcohol addiction is to be removed from the root, then social reform will also have to be taken up
 chunautiyaan aage kaaphi hai, lekin sharaab ke khilaaf matdaan karke kachabli gaanv ke logon ne loktantr main ek misaal jarur kaayam kii he

 baaki netaaon ko 10-10 second ke liye 6 baar dikhaate hai jabaki us ek chehre ko ek hi baar 6 ghante ke liye dikhaaya jaataa he
 'this has never happened before
 
 
 gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha, 'aisa pehle kabhi nahin hua ki ek hi chehre ko itnaa mahatv dikhaaya
 This did not happen during Indira Gandhi nor during the time of Atal Bihari Bajpayee
 media vaale jo dikhaaenge log vahiin dekhenge

 Attacking Modi, Azad said, 'PM candidates do not give anyone else a chance to reply
 kisi bhi party kaa koi bhi netaa kuch bolta he jawaab bijepi ke piem candidate hi dete hai

 ' It takes a lot of courage to follow the steps of an adult movie star, but Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh is doing something similar
 ye ham nahin balki porn star se bollywood filmon main kadam rakh chukin sani leone kah rahi hai
 According to the news, Ragini MMS-2 actress Sunny Leone has been saying that Ranveer Singh is following her footsteps
 sani leone ek condom brands ko andorse karti hai or ab ranvir singh bhi aisa hi kar rahe hai
 Leon has since been saying that Ranveer is copying him
 ab ye to bhagwaan hi jaanata he ki wo aisa kar rahe hai yaa nahin lekin ek baat to he ki bollywood main agar dam kii baat kii jaae to ranvir is list main top par najar aate hai
 Sunny Leone's Manforce Condom Adaranvir Singh's Durex Condom Aid mayawati sarkaar par ‘kushasan’ kaa aarope lagaate hue congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi ne kaha ki garibon, kisaanon or graminon ke haq kii khule taur par pradesh sarkaar dwaara andekhi kii ja rahi he or dindahade janata ke dhan ko lutaa ja rahaa he
 Congress General Secretary and MP Rahul Gandhi, while addressing the 'potential Youth Cadetate Meet', accused the state of scam of thousands of crores of rupees given under the National Rural Health Mission being run by the Central Government for the health of villagers
 Have done rahul ne aarope lagaaya ki pradesh sarkaar ne kisaanon kii jameenon ko jabardastee unase chhinakar unhen bedakhal kar diya
 Not only this, there are constant complaints of misappropriation of funds given by the Central Government

 He said that there is so much corruption in other political parties that only officials are imposed from above
 isiilie unki party aviral nadi kii bhaanti sheetaltaa or pavitrataa ke saath puure desh main bah rahi he

 With Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir's remarkable centuries and a record 233 runs for the first wicket, India on Tuesday crossed the 400-run mark on a single day for the first time to move towards a mammoth score in the second Test cricket match against Sri Lanka
 sahvaag ne pehle over main mili jeevandaan kaa phayda uthaakar 131 ran banaaye jabaki gambhir ne lagaataar chauthe test match main shatak jadkar 167 ran kii joardaar pari kheli
 Rahul Dravid (85 not out) also followed in the footsteps of these two not far from a hundred which helped India to 417 for two by the end of the first day's play
 dravid ke saath duusare chor par sachin tendulkar 20 ran banaakar khel rahe hai
 This is India's highest score in a single day
 isse pehle usne pichley saal chennai main dakshin africa ke khilaaf 386 ran banaaye the
 Not only this, Sehwag and Gambhir's partnership is the third largest partnership for the first wicket from India and a new record against Sri Lanka
 salaami ballebaaj gautam gambhir ko muralidharan ne apane hi gend par kaich lapakkar bharat kaa doosraa wicket jhatka
 Gambhir scored 167 runs with the help of 15 fours
 yah unke test karier kaa aathvaan shatak he
 Gambhir shared a 137-run partnership for the second wicket with Dravid
 mahendra singh dhoni ke tas jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne ke faisle ke baad sab kuch bharat ke anukool gata
 India was confident that if the openers spend the first hour, then batting will become easier and Gambhir and Sehwag did not disappoint the team
 sahvaag ko shuru main jamane main samay laga lekin jab unke paanv jam gayi to srilankai gendbaaj unke balle se ranon kaa pravaah nahin roak paye
 On the other hand, Gambhir presented an unmatched sample of his defensive and aggressive attitude and became the second batsman from India to score a century in four consecutive fourth Test matches
 unase pehle sunil gavaskar or rahul dravid yah karnama kar chuke hai
 If Mahela Jayawardene had taken the catch of Sehwag in the first slip early in the morning, then the story could have been different
 chanaaka velegedara kii match kii chauthi gend sahvaag ke balle kaa kinaaraa lekar slip kshetra main gayi lekin jayavardhane kaich nahin le paye
 However, Mahela was not entirely to blame for this as wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene dived meaninglessly to take the catch that did not make the slip fielder guess right
 srilanka ko isaki bahut badi keemat chukaani padi or pehali safalataa ke liye 42wein over tak intjaar karnaa padaa
 Sehwag specifically targeted Angelo Mathews after receiving a life-ball, who took charge of the new ball with Velegedara, having three spinners in the Sri Lankan side
 unhone is gendbaaj ke lagaataar over main do-do chauke jamaaye
 Gambhir also did not lag behind and showed his aggressive attitude in between
 srilankai captain kumaar sangakaara ne jab rangana herath ko gend saunpi to gambhir ne teen chauke jamaakar unhen gendbaaji se hatwa diya
 Ajantha Mendis was handed the ball in place of Herath, who was dominated by Sehwag and did not let the mysterious spinner, playing his first match in this tour, show the magic of his two fingers
 lunch ke baad sahvaag ne velegedara kii pehali gend hi seemaa rekha paar bheji
 The Delhi batsman soon completed his century and then hit three consecutive fours on Muttiah Muralitharan
 is bich sahvaag or gambhir ne 218 ran kii apni pichhali sarvshereshth saajhedaari kaa record todaa jo 2004 main isi maidan par dakshin africa ke khilaaf bana tha
 Sri Lanka were finally relieved in the 42nd over when Sehwag's drive in the air off Muralitharan's ball went into the hands of Tillakaratne Dilshan at extra cover
 gambhir ne iske turant baad apana aathvaan test shatak puraa kiya jabaki dravid ne apane chir parichit andaaj main score aage badhaayaa
 Earlier, India made two changes in their team for this match and replaced Ishant Sharma and Amit Mishra in s Sreesanth and Pragyan Ojha
 srilanka ne chotil dhammika prasad ke sthaan par mendis ko antim ekadash main rakhkar teen spinneron ke saath utarane kaa faisla kiya

 The suspects arrested in the multi-crore narcotics and money laundering case made some serious revelations in custody
 upie 2 ke dauraan idi in khulaason par haath par haath dhare baitha rahaa
 Now that he is under Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, he wants to interrogate Majithia about his alleged links with the drug racket
 akali dal ke bhitari log is kadam ko apni party ke netritv par hamale kii koshish maanate hai
 Majithia is also the brother-in-law of Punjab Deputy Chief Minister and SAD President Sukhbir Singh Badal

 About four weeks ago, he told India Today, "our relationship will last for at least the next 25 years

 Ever since the BJP came to power on its own in the neighboring state of Haryana, surprising everyone, there has been a series of everyday allegations and counter-allegations between the second and third tier leaders of the alliance
 darasal 19 aktubar ko haryana ke nattejey aane se pehle hi purv cricket khilaadi or amritsar se teen baar saansad rah chuke bijepi ke netaa navjot singh siddhu ne akali netritv par nishaanaa sadhate hue apshabdon kii bauchhaar shuru kar di thi
 At an election rally, he said, "traitors! Snakes of sleeves! Chaalbaaz! ”and left no doubt that Badal is referring to father-son-chief minister Parkash Singh and his son Sukhbir
 phir bhi kisi ke man main shaq rahaa ho ki ye siddhu ke vyaktigat vichaar hai, to vah us vakt dur ho gaya, jab november kii shuruyaat main shanta kumaar kii jagah punjab maamalon ke prabharee banaae gaye bijepi netaa ramshankar katheria (ab kendriya mantri) ne apni pari kii shuruyaat is saarvajanik elaan ke saath kii ki agle vidhansabha chunaavon main party ko ‘‘akele apane dam par utarane’’ par vichaar karnaa padegaa

 He says that in April 1996, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Prakash Singh Badal formed this alliance on the basis of three basic issues - aman-chan, Punjabi identity and Punjabiyat (punjabi culture) - and since then both parties have been committed to them
 lekin ab bijepi rajya main zyada varchasv or aadhipaty kii talash main he
 There is a different view
 haalanki isko maanane vaale bijepi kii bajaae akali dal main zyada hai
 Accordingly, since the two parties represent two completely different Sikh and Hindu voter communities, their mutual alliance is unlikely to go the bjp-shiv Sena route
 yahaan tak ki iske hindu vot bank main saajha karne vaali haryana janhit congress or bhartiya rashtriya lok dal sareekhee partiyon ke saath naakaam gathbandhan ke raste par jane kii sambhaavna bhi nahin he
 Despite this, both parties have not avoided burglary in each other's vote bank

 (with Punjab Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal (right) Vikram Majithia) The Badal family is clearly nervous
 farvari 2007 main congress ko haraakar satta main aane ke baad yah pehali baar he, jab akali dal ke panthik agenda (aam dharna ke mutabik jisamen khalistaani andolan ko sulgaane main chinagaari kaa kaam karne vaale anandpur sahib prastaav ke kuch hisse bhi shaamil hai) ko phir se garmaya ja rahaa he
 This is the reason why in the brainstorming meeting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi organized for the reorganization of the Planning Commission, Chief Minister Badal advocated "true federalism"
 Veteran Akali leader Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa demanded withdrawal of gallantry awards given to Indian military personnel for Operation Bluestar and Sukhbir Badal urged him to immediately release Khalistani prisoners in jails even after completion of the sentence
 23 disambar ko vidhansabha main majithia ko lekar chal rahe hangaame ke bich esaidi ne ek prastaav pesh kiya, jisamen chandigarh ko fouran punjab ko saunpane kii maang kii gai thi

 The rhetoric of Sukhbir and Parkash Singh Badal also gives a glimpse of the tension in the alliance
 dipti siem punjab main maadak padaarthon ke failte kaarobaar ke liye ‘‘centre-niyantrit seemaa balon kii badtar nigaraanee vyavastha’’ ko doshi tehraate hai
 a month ago, he criticized the Center for delay in payment of compensation of Rs 5 lakh announced on 31 October for the 1984 Sikh riot victims

 com / znpbcloata — Shweta Sannaik (@sannaiksavita) December 6, 2019 Here's the story of that night, on 27 November, she was burnt alive by gang-raping a female doctor in Hyderabad
 is ghatana ne logon ko hilaa kar rakh diya tha
 Eight days later, all four accused died in the police encounter during the scene
 is encounter kii ghatana kaa logon ne swaagat kiya he
 'revolver Rani' has hit the box office this week
 
 
 'revolver rani', yani kangana ranavat, jo dikhengi alka singh ke kirdaar main
 
 
 Also seen will be Veer Das, Piyush Mishra, Zakir Hussain, Pankaj Saraswat and Kumud Mishra
 
 
 film kaa nirdesan kiya he sai kabir ne
 
 
 The political revolver in 'revolver Rani', set against the backdrop of Chambal, is played on the basis of bullets
 
 
 yahaan 'revolver rani' ko chunaav main maat de jate hai udaibhaan tomars, yani zakir hossain, lekin agle chunaav ko phir jeetne kii taiyaari main jute jate hai alka ke mamaa balli, yani piyush mishra, jinhone alka ko bachapan se paala he or use satta main dekhnaa chaahate hai
 
 
 Meanwhile, Alka Dil is giving Bollywood actor Rohan Kapoor, ie Veer Das
 
 
 aage kya hota he, yah jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi, lekin aapako itnaa zarur bataaenge ki film kisi he
 
 
 First of all, the writer Sai Kabir has beautifully crafted the characters of the film
 
 
 chaahe vah kangana kaa kirdaar ho, zakir hossain kaa, yaa kumud mishra yaa pankaj saraswat kaa
 
 
 You will find the character of 'revolver Rani' new in every way
 
 
 unke kapade, get-ap, empi kii bhashaa bolnaa, ye sab aapako aakarshith kar sakate hai, lekin bataur abhinetri film ke pehle bhaag main kahin na kahin unka kirdaar khud se jujhataa nazar aata he
 
 
 At some places, she does not seem to be cast in her character
 
 
 film ke baaki kirdaaron or unke abhinay main nayaapan nazar aata he
 
 
 You will be forced to laugh at many places in the film
 
 
 haalanki nirdeshak-lekhak sai kabir ko khyaal rakhana chahie tha ki ek hi tarah ke zyada seens ko dohraane se kirdaar apni chamak kho sakate hai or film dhili pad sakati he
 
 
 This is what i felt in the first half
 
 
 alka kaa rohan ke liye paagalpan or tomars bhaaiyon kii alka se dushmani darshakon par baari padane lagati he, lekin shukr he, interval ke baad film main tivest or terns aate hai, or kahani aage badhati he
 
 
 All the actors in the film have done amazing work
 
 
 film ke gane bhi achche hai, lekin kai baar kahani ko todate hai
 
 
 Sai Kabir's direction and writing are both good, just that he needs to learn the skill and skill of scissoring some of his scenes
 
 
 meri nazar main 'revolver rani' ek acchhee film he, or is film ke liye meri reating he - 3
 5 stars

 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Shrikant Shinde reached the Lok Sabha by winning the election on the Shiv Sena ticket from this seat
 unhone ensipi ke anand paranjape ko chunaav haraaya tha
 Interestingly, Anand Paranjpe came for the 2009 Lok Sabha election from Shiv Sena ticket
 lekin 2014 loksabhaa ke pehle wo shivasena chhodkar ensipi se jud gaye
 He also contested the election, but had to face defeat

 No party has won unilaterally in the last few elections in the Kalyan Lok Sabha seat
 kyonki yahaan maharashtra nav nirmaan sena (MNS) har chunaav main sameekaran bigaad detii he
 If seen, where the MNS candidate had reduced the margin of victory of the Shiv Sena candidate in the elections of 2009 and 2014, then the ncp's victory math was spoiled

 Kalyan Lok Sabha seat came into existence in 2008 after delimitation

 unke nidhan ke baad shivasena ne prakaash paranjape ke bete anand paranjape ko tikat diya
 Anand took over the father's legacy and won elections
 shivasena se alag hue or haar gaye
 
 
 Anand Paranjpe was elected MP from Kalyan but shortly after, he became bitter with Shiv Sena
 iskaa asar yah hua ki shivasena se wo dur ho gaye or unhone ensipi kii sadsyta le lee
 In 2014, Anand contested from NCP and lost

 During this time Modi attacked the entire opposition including Congress
 unhone kaha ki in logon ko kabhi bhi loktantr par vishwaas nahin rahaa, pichley chaar saal main aisa hamen baar-baar dekhne ko mila he
 In the last few days, the way the opposition has tried to surround Modi, he retaliated today and gave the message till 2019

 Opponents find development a joke
 The PM said that the truth is that whatever work is done for the poor, Dalits-backward-tribals, the Congress and its allies either start hogging it, or make fun of it
 Huh

 Hilsa fish, an important part of the culturally rich Bengal cuisine, may soon become extinct due to man's greed
 bharat va bangladesh donon hi deshon ke nivasee is machhlee ko bade chaav se khate hai lekin ab inaki sankhya kam hone lagi he
 Bengali people know Hilsa by the name Ilish
 beete kuch saalon main pashchim bengal kii nadiyon main in chaandi jaisi safed rang kii machhliyon kii aabaadi main kami ai he
 The main reason is the deterioration of natural balance
 hilsa (tenualosa ilisha) mukhya rup se samudr main rahati he lekin prajnan ke liye nadiyon main jaati he
 After laying eggs, the fish returns to the sea again and during this time it gets trapped in the fishermen's net
 vaise beete kuch saalon se machuaare samudr se nadi main aane vaali vayask machhliyaan pakad rahe hai
 They also catch small fish (kiosks in Bengali) and eggs while returning to the sea of these fish
 iske parinamswaroop inaki sankhya main kami aa rahi he
 Shib Das of Kolkata-based West Bengal Animal and Fisheries University said, “everyone is concerned about the availability of Hilsa on the Bengal coast during the last decade
 ' hilsa kii kam hoti aabaadi ke liye machuaare hi nahin balki ise apana bhojan banane vaale log bhi jimmedaar hai
 In the past, Bengalis did not eat Hilsa in those days when small new fish came out of eggs, but now it is eaten in every season
 isse isaki taadaad par asar padaa he
 Now, seriousness is being seen among its consumers also
 dilli nivasee paloma ganguli ne bataaya, 'khud main beete kuch saalon se hilsa laane se bachati rahi hum
 But on a personal level, avoiding eating or not hunting it will not help much
 'atlantic sagar main pai jane vaali machhlee toona kii ghatati aabaadi ko dekhte hue europea deshon ne ab vyavsaayik taur par is machhlee ke pakadaney par pratibandh kii anushansa di he
 In such a situation, the question arises whether for the protection of Hilsa, it should be banned completely in India and Bangladesh
 zyaadaatar logon kaa maananaa he ki purna pratibandh iskaa jawaab nahin he
 Food Veteran Rahul Verma from Delhi says, "people of any other place in the world are not so obsessed with eating fish as they are in India
" yadi hilsa par pratibandh lagata he to footbal maichon ke kattar pratidwandviyon mohan bagan va east bengal ke bich match band ho jaaenge
 Ganguly said, 'complete ban is not possible
 bangladesh ke liye hilsa ek pramukh niryaat saamagree he
 i think that in a particular season when these fish lay eggs and the eggs hatch, then the government should ban them
 ' Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who returned from three months of health benefits, has stressed on the previous UPA government, saying that since the NDA government was formed in 2014, the country's economy has undergone radical changes

 Comparing the data released by the IMF on February 2014 and july-august 2018, the Finance Minister wrote through blogs on the social site Twitter and Facebook, that we have progressed a lot in the last four years, many reforms have been done by the government through legislature and other means Huh

 At the same time, according to the report in 2018, economic stability has come compared to 2014 and has also resulted in structural reforms

 Referring to the Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, the Congress said that the Congress-led UPA-I and UPA-II governments gave the best decadal growth to the country's economy after independence

 karnataka kii raajnneeti main jamini netaa ke taur par unka naam aata he

 Sushma Swaraj contested from Bellary in Karnataka in 1999 — this was when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was not known much in the state
 na to kisi ko bhaajapa ke bare pataa tha or na sushamaa swaraj ke bare main
 It was a tough fight
 ve rajya main majbootee se jami congress party kii sonia gandhi se loha le rahi thim
 But Swaraj swiftly embraced this challenge
 unhone kannada seekhney ke liye do tutor rakhe or apane hunar or jabardast samaran shakti ke bal par ek pakhwaade ke bheetar reliyon ko dharapravaah kannada main sambodhit karne lageen
 i myself came to know about his Kannada from some local journalists and everyone said that they have done very well indeed
 unka shabdon kaa uccharan or chayan shandaar tha
 Although she lost by just 50,000 votes, she won many hearts
 swaraj ne har bhoomika—saansad, party kaaryakarta, mantri—pakke iraade, lagan or eemaandaaree se nibhaai jo unki anuthi khubi thi
 The BJP decided in 2009 that Swaraj was among its stalwarts, so she would campaign and not contest elections
 magar is baar unhone apni pasand saaf-saaf bataa di or unhen chunaav ladgaye diya gaya
 She fought and won Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh
 bhaajapa ko sirf 116 siton ke saath karaari haar jhelni padi, par party ne 1984 main sirf do sansad sadasyon ke baad kaaphi lanbaa rasta tay kar liya tha
 This was partly due to the team that also had Swaraj
 200 saansadon ke lakshya ke saath bhaajapa kaa majboot sansadeey dal banane ke liye unhen 1980 ke dashak ke madhya main laalkrishna adwani ne chunaa tha
 Other members of the team were Narendra Modi, Pramod Mahajan, Venkaiah Naidu, Arun Jaitley, Anant Kumar and Govindacharya
 unhone party ko khadaa karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaai, jahaan unhen dayaalu 'didi' kahkar sammaan diya jaataa tha
 The same year, Swaraj replaced Advani as Leader of the Opposition
 ve khaasi safagoi or bebaaki se apana najariya rakhti thim or sattarudh party ko javabdehi ke kathghare main khadaa karti thim
 That too when many scams like coal and telecom were echoing daily in Parliament
 prakhar or pratibhavan vaktaa hone ke naate, khaskar hindi main—kai log unhen is maamle main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke str kaa vaktaa maanate the—swaraj ne party ke rukh ko logon tak pahunchaaya
 In 1998, when Vajpayee asked him to take charge as the Chief Minister of Delhi, initially Swaraj was not willing to move from national to state level politics, but still accepted that challenge
 unhen jin kai 'pehle pahal' kaa shrey hasil he, unamem nunatam tay 25 saal kii umr main sabase noujvaan mantri bananaa bhi tha
 She was the first woman spokesperson of any national party and also the country's first full-time female foreign minister
 videsh mantri ke taur par unhone bandhe-bandhaae saanche ko tod diya
 It was not necessary for him to socialize and communicate with the people in this chair
 magar unhone ise badal diya or khud ko zyada sulabh banane ke liye soshal media kaa istemaal karne vaali pehali mantri bani
 Indians from all over the world knocked on his door and he never disappointed
 swaraj puri kii puri bhartiya thim, par unka najariya vaishvik tha
 She was also a full-time political, professional and family woman, an iconoclast of Indian traditions and culture
 unki jagah koi nahin le saktaa
 She will always be a role model for all those who want to come into public life

 'rais' kii laila banane ke liye sani ko mili 4 karodkhabaron kaa maane to aryan kaa acanut delit karne ke peeche vajah, personal life ko privet rakhana hai
 Some say that they have done this at the behest of Shahrukh Khan because he wants his family to stay away from the limelight of social media
 philhal ye kah paanaa mushkil he ki asal vajah kya he lekin jo bhi ho isse soshal media par unke phans kaaphi niraashaa hui he

 Employees of this company came to know that it has received a business order of two million dollars from Donald Trump administration

 There are reports in the US media that children are being treated inhumanely
 jagah kii saaf-safai nahin he or unhen basi khaanaa diya jaataa he
 When the employees of the company got the news of this business agreement, 500 employees wrote a letter to their boss saying that it is unethical and the company should donate the profits from this business
 karmchaariyon ne kaam karne kii jagah chhod di or baahar aa gaye
 Walkout, but also created a Twitter handle to tell the world
 company ko apane karmchaariyon kii baat manani padi or faisla hua ki ek lakh dollar red cross ko daan diya jayega, jo bacchon ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 Employees also raised slogans that these camps for children are torture camps, they should be closed
 yah ek kism kaa satyagrah he, jo company par naitik hone kaa dabaav daalata he
 This protest has come from the workers
 america main trump kii imigration niti ke kilaaf andolan chal rahaa he
 The agitators are also appealing to consumers not to buy products from companies that are making profits by taking orders from the Trump administration and Migrant of Mexico is being held in a torture camp
 amezon, microsoft, google ke karmchaariyon ne bhi is tarah kii amanviya niti kaa virodh kiya he
 way-fair employees have achieved two objectives simultaneously

 Also, not much progress in reducing the number of children outside the scope of school education confirms our apprehension that there is no possibility of these countries achieving the goal of universal primary education by 2015
 unesco ke niti dastavej kehete hai ki is disha main sakaaratmak badlaav mumkin he
 17 countries have changed this trend over the past decade
 unesco institute for statisticks kaa kahana he ki 43 pratishat bachche jisamen 1

 After the violence in Muzaffarnagar, when all the peace in the district is returning again, all the parties have started giving political color to this riot
 achaanak soobe ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav mujffarnagar daura karte hai or kuch jagah jaakar waapas laut jate hai
 During this tour, he also has to face opposition from people in many places
 unke jane ke baad 24 ghante baad pradhanmantri manmohan singh, sonia gandhi or rahul bhi jile ke daure par aate hai lekin ye bhi kuch jagah kaa daura kar waapas nikal jate hai
 During this time, either the head of the Uttar Pradesh government, Akhilesh or the Prime Minister of the country, Manmohan Singh, both governments give heartfelt compensation to the people and victims of the riots, but during this time no one is looking towards Kakra village

 About 50 people have been injured
 darasal 7 sitambar ko nangla panchayat se waapas laut rahe logon par duusare samudaay ke logon ne ghaat laga kar hamalaa kiya tha

 kakda gaanv bhi inhi gaanv main se ek he
 The visits of both CM and PM have been completed through this village, but the administration did not allow them to meet neither the Chief Minister nor the Prime Minister nor perhaps the eyes of these politicians turned towards the people of this village
 upi sarkaar ho yaa centre sarkaar ab is gaanv ke logon kaa kisi par bhi vishwaas nahin rahaa he
 The government is now rejecting the people of this village, its leader Ajit Singh
 aapako bataa den ki kakda gaanv jaaton ke gaanv ke naam se janaa jaataa he or aaj is gaanv kii naaraaz janata ne ek panchayat bulaai or un par ho rahe atyaacharon ke bare main vichaar-vimarsh kiya gaya
 In these conditions, the people of this village would now have an inclination towards the party
 ye abhi dekhnaa baaki he
 But one thing is now coming to the fore that politics has started on the riots in Muzaffarnagar

 sunwaayee ke dauraan dilli police ne court ko bataaya ki dilli sarkaar ne maamle ke aaropee kanhaiya kumaar or anya ke khilaaf deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaane kii anumit nahin di he
 So this case is stuck
 dilli police ne kaha ki ye maamla abhi bhi dilli sarkaar ke grih vibhaag main atka padaa he
 After the plea of delhi Police, the judge has asked the Delhi government why there is so much delay in taking a decision on this
 bataa den ki is maamle main dilli police ne 14 janvari ko hi chargeshit daakhil kar di thi
 In this, a total of 10 people including Kanhaiya Kumar were accused
 aropiyon ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane ke liye dilli police ko dilli sarkaar se parmishan chahie
 The Delhi government has not been able to decide whether to allow Kanhaiya Kumar to be tried under the sedition section for the last 8 months

 ' The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announced the 10th and 12th board exam dates on January 10, but students, parents and teachers appeared unhappy with the datesheet
 darasal students kaa kahana he ki detshit jis tarah se banaai gai he usamen peparon ke bich taiyaari ke liye paryaapt gap nahin diya gaya he
 Due to which they may face difficulties during the examination

 Board exams will start from March 5, do this by making such a routine, this is the reason for not changing the study sheets, according to CBSE officials, the 12th class datesheet of the board has been made keeping in mind the competitive examination
 vahiin sibiesai ne aage kaha ki abhi kareeb 200 vishay hai, jinamein se students koi bhi vishay chun sakate hai
 According to the current education system, science students are required to take a subject of an art or commerce
 aise main ham kitni bhi koshish kar len, koi na koi aisa din jarur hoga jab do vishyon ke bich gap dena sambhav nahin hoga
 Therefore in this case it is not possible to change the datasheet
 sirf padhai hi nahin, ye kaam karke board exam main ban sakenge toppergauratlab he ki CBSE ne 10 janvari ko 10veen or 12veen kii board parikshaon kii tarikhon kaa elaan kar diya tha

 The attitude of RBI and other banks misread that the Reserve Bank and other banks have ignored public demand to provide the required information, citing the relationship of trust and economic interests

 modi sarkaar ke nae kaarykaal kii shuruyaat ho gai he, mantriyon ne apane-apane mantralayon kaa charge sanbhaalanaa shuru kar diya he
 One of these became the Minister of State for Home Affairs
 kishan reddy ne bhi shanivaar apana kaarybhaar sambhala
 Talking to India Today after taking over, Kishan Reddy said that Hyderabad has become a safe zone for terrorists
 jab bhi enie ke chaape padate hai to uskaa sambandh hyderabad se nikalataa he or iske liye telugana sarkaar kuch nahin kar rahi he
 After this statement by Minister of State for Home Kishan Reddy, senior minister in his department Amit Shah has reprimanded him
 sutron ke mutabik grih mantri amit shah ne apane junior mantri ko aise bayanon se bachane kii salaah di he
 Reddy's statement has also been criticized by Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi
 radd ne apane bayaan main kaha ki enarasi na keval assam nahin balki puure desh main lagu hona chahie
 India is the only country that allows intruders to remain in the country
 ye ghuspaithiye bharatiyon ke adhikaron se takaraa rahe hai
 Apart from this, Reddy said that Hyderabad has become a safe zone for terrorists
 jab bhi enie kii red padati he to uskaa sambandh hyderabad se nikalataa he or iske liye telugana sarkaar kuch nahin kar rahi he
 In addition to the statement on Shriram's cheers, on the issue of Bengal, Reddy said that it is not right for any Chief Minister to take action against those who shout slogans of Jai Shri Ram
 jai shri ram ke naare bharat main nahin to kya pakistan main lagenge
 He also said that even Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation, used to say o Ram
 vahiin kendriya grih rajya mantri ji
 AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has retaliated against Kishan Reddy's statement
 unhone poocha ki 5 saalon main aisa kitni baar hua he jab enie, ibi yaa ro ne likhit main diya ho ki hyderabad aantkiyon ke liye sef zone ban rahaa he
 It is very unfortunate when such things are said
 ovaisi ne kaha ki pichley 5 saalon se yahaan shanti he, koi sampradayik dange nahin hue hai, dharmik tyohaar shanti se manaae jate hai
 Hyderabad is a growing city
 reddy aisa bol rahe hai, telugana yaa hyderabad ke saath unki kya dushmani he? kya unhen isaki tarakkee acchhee nahin lag rahi he? grih rajya mantri kaa aisa kahana hyderabad ke liye unki nafrat ko dikhaata he
 No minister likes such irresponsible statements, but we expect the same from them
 ve jahaan bhi musalamaanon ko dekhte hai, unhen vah aatankwaadiyon se jod dete hai
 We can't fix it

 Tridev resides in Haridwar, but in this city of salvation, there is also a Shaktipeeth which is witness to the renunciation of Sati
 yah shaktipeeth sati ke shiv ke prati prem kaa bhi gavaah he
 Shaktipeeth, the Maya Devi of Haridwar, is one of the 51 Shaktipeeths where Sati's navel fell
 devanagari haridwar main patit paavani ganga bhakton ke paap dhoti he
 The importance of this city of Mahakumbh is further increased by the touch of Mokshadayini Ganga which came out of Shiva's shoes
 kehete hai yaheen brahma, vishnu or mahesh vaas karte hai or isi dharm nagari main basaa he wo sthaan jo sunaata he sati ke krodh or shiv kaa apmaan na jhel paane ke baad sati ke aatmadah kii kahani
 The relationship between Sati and Shiva is unbreakable
 bhagwaan bhole main basati hai sati or shakti ke hriday main rahete hai shiv
 But after the fire of Sati, when Lord Shiva was wandering throughout the universe with Sati's body, Lord Vishnu cut Sati's body into pieces with his Sudarshan Chakra
 dharti par ye tukade jahaan-jahaan gire wo sthaan shaktipeeth kehalaae
 One of those 51 Shaktipeeths is the Maya Devi temple in Haridwar where the navel of Sati fell
 puranic manyata ke anusaar jab sati ne apane pita ke yajna main apane pati ko nahin bulaae jane se apamaanit hone par aatmadah kar liya tha or apane sharir ko vahiin satikund par chhodkar mahamaya rup main haridwar ke isi sthaan par aa gai thim
 That is why this place was named Maa Mayadevi
 isi ke baad se haridwar ko bhi mayapuri ke naam se janaa jane laga or ye sthaan desh kii saat puriyon main shaamil ho gaya
 Maya Devi is considered as the presiding deity of Haridwar, whose history is available from the 11th century
 pracheen kaal se maaya devi mandir main devi kii pindi virajman he or 18veen shatabdi main is mandir main devi kii murtiyon kii praan pratishtha kii gai
 Tantra Sadhana is also done in this temple along with religious rituals
 haridwar main bhagwati kii naabhi giri thi, isliye is sthaan ko brahmad kaa centre bhi mana jaataa he
 a wonderful triangle exists to protect Haridwar
 is trikon ke do bindu parvaton par maa mansa or maa chandi raksha kavach ke rup main sthit he to vahiin trikon kaa shikhar dharti kii ore he or usee adhomukh shikhar par bhagwati maaya asin hai
 In addition to the mother Maya in this court of the mother, devotees also get the blessings of the mother Kali and the Goddess Kamakhya
 jahaan maa kaali devi maaya ke baayin or to vahiin dahinni ore maa kamakhya virajman hai
 With the blessings of Mother Maya, bad things are also done and the obstacles in the path of success are removed
 maa ke chamatkaaron kii kahani lambii he or mahima anant
 What once came at the door of Maa Maya, she does not go anywhere else
 maa maaya devi mandir ke saath hi bhairav baba kaa mandir bhi maujuud he or manyata he ki maa kii puja tab tak purna nahin maani jaati jab tak bhakt bhairav baba kaa darshan pujan kar unki aradhana nahin kar lete
 Those who attend the Aarti in the early evening of Bhagwati are partakers of unbroken virtue
 aarti kii lau main maa kaa aseem aashirwad he
 And the light of the flame of Aarti brings the light of happiness in the life of the devotees by doing all the darkness of life's sufferings
 maa maaya devi ke peeth par shaam dhale hajaaron lakhon bhakt maa ke darshan karne, unki aarti main shaamil hone ke liye ghanton intjaar karte hai
 And when the drums are sung and worshiped by the mother of drums and hour sounds, every wish of the devotees is fulfilled
 navaratri main maa mayadevi mandir main bhakton kii taadaad bad jaati he
 Devotees who come here worship Maa Shakti
 mana jaataa he ki maa mayadevi mandir main puja kabhi nishphal nahin jaati he
 Pooja archana has special significance in this temple during Navratras
 yahaan aane vaale bhakton kii maa mayadevi mandir ke prati agaadh shraddha he or manyata he ki jisane bhi sachche man se puja karke maa ke darbar main guhaar lagaayi he maa ne uski pukaar kabhi ansuni nahin kii
 Devotees do not forget to offer flowers of reverence to the mother when wishes come true
 yun to moksh kii nagari main anginat mandir hai, lekin maa maaya kaa ye mandir apane chamatkaaron kii vajah se puure shahar main kuch alag hi sthaan rakhata he
 It is the belief of the mother's glory and the devotees believe that here not only from Haridwar, but also from other corners of the country, devotees flock and bow their head in front of the mother

 Chris Gayle: First batsman, here 100 sixes - Suresh Raina, Chennai Super Kings v KKR, 2014106 - Brad Hogg, Victoria v New South Wales 2006146 * - Chris Gayle, Rangpur v Dhaka, 2917 dilli emsidi ke chunaavon main bijepi kii 'jeet kii hetric' kii taiyaari he or soshal media par iskaa khub jashn manaaya ja rahaa he; lekin bijepi kii jeet se zyada soshal media 'aap' kii hoti haar par chutkiyaan letaa dikhaai diya
 The Aam Aadmi Party's historic victory in the Delhi elections in 2015 surprised everyone
 lekin sirf dhai saalon main siem kejariwal or aam aadmi party se uthe logon ke vishwaas ne in emsidi chunaavon main sthiti ko badal kar rakh diya
 Often a wave of 'change' is seen in the opposition of the ruling party in elections, but for the last 10 years, people have cleared their public opinion against 'AAP' by re-electing the BJP which has been in power in the MCD

 The # ap_saf hashtag started trending on Twitter and people tweeted several times during the election by Kejriwal choosing 'chukangunia and dengue or him'

 There was a murder in Kotha No 57 of Delhi's infamous GB Road
 qatl kothe par rahane vaali ek sex varkar kaa hua tha
 So there was a fear atmosphere in the entire area
 sawaal yah tha ki aakhir ek tawayph kaa qatl kisne or kyon kiya? jawaab dhundne kaa kaam police kaa tha
 The police arrived at the scene of the incident and found the body of a 20-22 year old girl lying on the bed of the room
 aadki kaa galaa kisi tejadhaar hathiyaar se reta gadha tha
 Therefore, the police officers started the interrogation of the mistress of Kotha number 57
 tabhi laash kii talaashi le rahaa ek pulisavaale ko bistar ke neeche ek mobile phone dikhaai detaa he
 The police constable picks up a mobile phone from the bed with a handkerchief and quietly brings it to his officer
 police ke afasaron ne sonia kii laash ko postmortem ke liye bhej diya
 Now the police had a corpse and a mobile phone found near the corpse
 darasal, tafteesh ke dauraan police ko makatool kaa mobile miltaa he
 The important clue was now about to be received from this mobile
 mobile main tamaam number the
 Only one of them had a murderer hidden in it
 aakhirkaar number tres karte-karte police us shaks tak pahunch hi gai, jis par sabase zyada shaq tha
 However, despite all the protests, the policemen pick up Tannu
 police ko shaq hi nahin puraa yakeen tha ki ho na ho, tannu ne yaa to katl ko anjaam diya he yaa phir ko kaatil ke bare main jarur kuch jaanata he
 This was the reason that the police of Kamalnagar police station started strictly questioning Tannu
 police kii sakht poochtacha se tannu ghabara jaataa he
 He understands that now his pole has been exposed, he has been exposed
 police ko uske khilaaf pukhta saboot bhi mil gaye hai
 Hence, Tannu falls at the feet of the crying police officers and confesses his crime
 lekin yah kahani abhi yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 a love story of red light begins from here
 tannu ab kisi tote kii tarah red lite or us raat kii kahani suna rahaa tha
 But the policemen were also surprised to hear the story Tannu told the police about his life
 ji haa, kahani redlite kii, kahani ishk kii, kahani barbaadi kii, kahani ek colgirl ke katl kii
 
 
 
 darasal, tannu chahta tha ki wo sonia naam kii us colgirl ko jismfaroshi ke daldal se baahar nikaal le
 He also wanted to marry Sonia
 lekin sonia kisi bhi haalat main kothe ko chhodana nahin chaahati thi, jabaki tannu apana sabakuch sonia par lutaa chukaa tha
 On the night of January 2, Tannu put his lover to death at Kotha No
 57, GB Road
 darasal, is kahani kii shuruyaat saal 2010 main hoti he, jab tannu jibi road par rahane vaali sonia ke pyaar main ulajh jaataa he
 Tannu was already married to a callgirl from Kothe
 uskaa ek betaa bhi tha
 But now he wanted to marry Sonia
 tannu ne sonia ke liye apni bivi ke jevar, ghar-baar, jameen-jaaydaad, sab-kuch bech diya, uske baavjood sonia kothaa nahin chhodana chaahati thi
 Just this stubbornness of Sonia became the reason for her murder
 tannu ab salaakhon ke peeche he
 His name has been included in the list of murderers
 lekin redlite kii ek lav story kaa kadava sach yah bhi he ki tannu sonia ko jismfaroshi ke daldal se nikaalkar le janaa chahta tha

 The controversy of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavat has once again reached the court
 is baar film produs kar rahi vaiakom 18 ne supreme court main ek yachika daayar kii he
 The petition is against the restrictions placed on the film in four states
 vycom ne turant maamle par sunwaayee kii apil kii he
 The Supreme Court may soon give a date for the hearing
 bataa den ki mangalvaar ko haryana kii bijepi sarkaar ne suraksha kaarnon kaa hawala dete film ke pradarshan par bain laga diya tha
 Padmavat is scheduled to release in theaters on January 25 this month
 is film main deepika padukon shahid kapur or ranvir singh ne mukhya bhoomikaayen kii hai
 The decision was taken at the Haryana Cabinet meeting on Tuesday
 ranvir, deepika, shahid kapur starer ye film rajput samudaay ke virodh ke baad se vivaadon main he
 Haryana Minister Anil Vij said on the film's ban, it was decided in the cabinet meeting that it should be banned in the state keeping in mind the law and order
 cabinet main is faisle par sahmati bani
 With this, we have decided to ban Bhansali's film in Haryana
 padmavat: kya dhamkiyon se dar gaye nirmaataa? sitare nahin karenge film kaa pramoshnaupi, goa, maharashtra or uttarakhand jaise bijepi shasit anya rajyon main bhi film kaa pradarshan roke jane kii ashanka he
 Police in Goa have recommended the state government citing security reasons
 mumbai police ne security rigens kii duhai di he
 UP and other states talked about the film's performance a few days ago
 unhone abhi pradarshan ko lekar kuch saafe nahin kiya he
 Let me tell you, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavat will be released in three languages tamil, Telugu and Hindi
 sensor ne paanch modification ke saath film ko "U / A" certificate diya he
 Films with this certificate are not allowed to be viewed by minors alone
 yah desh kii pehali aisi hindi film hogi jo IMAX 3D hindi main relies hogi
 Sanjay Leela Bhansali, who made Padmavat 30 years ago, here is the proof that on December 1 last year, the film was not passed in the censor due to lack of certification process
 is vajah se nirmaataaon kii ore se tay relies par padmavat cinemagharon tak nahin pahunch pai
 After the resumption of the process, there are reports that the censor has approved the film with some changes
 pehle bhi sutron ne film ke 25 yaa 26 janvari ko relies hone kii sambhaavna jataai thi
 The Karni Sena's fiery performance over the film threatening to burn theaters is not taking its name to a standstill
 haal hi main madhya pradesh ke ratlam jile kii ek ghatana saamne ai, jisamen saint paul convent skool main film ke gane 'ghumar' chalaae jane ke virodh main todphod kii gai
 Karni Sena has objected to the film's release across the country
 dhamkee bhi di he ki agar film relies hui to cinemagharon ko jala diya jayega
 a leader of the Karni Sena even said that if anything changes with the name change, we will consider petrol as Ganga water and sprinkle it in theaters and set it on fire
 sensor ne banaai thi special cametikuch hi din pehle sensor ne film kii certification prakriya puri hone kii jaankaree di thi
 The censor constituted a committee for this
 cameti kii siforeeshon ke baad nirmaataaon ke saath ek meeting main film main 5 jaruri badlaav sujhaaye gaye the
 These changes are on the points that Deepika's film Padmavat has been opposing for the last several months
 sensor ne film ko u / a certificate diya he
 Akshay Kumar's Padman is also releasing on the same date as Padmaavat, starring Padmaavat, starring Padmaavat, Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor along with Padman
 yah film saamaajik mudde par aadhaarit he
 There was earlier discussion that Padman's date will be pushed forward due to Padmavat, but the producers are ready to release the film on the already scheduled date
 haalanki padmavat ke thik ek din baad relies hone vaali film ayyaari kii dats aage badha di gai

 With the number of seats Congress has registered in Gujarat for a very short time, it is clear that if this Grand Old Party had heard the noise of bjp's stronghold in 2015 itself, the picture would have been different today
 do saal pehle ek 22 saal ke noujvaan hardik patel ke aahvaan par lakhon kii sankhya main patidaar janata sadak par thi
 This was the time for Congress to understand
 chook sirf yaheen nahin hui
 In the same year, the textile traders who were coming from GST were also mobilized
 netritvheen yah virodh jald hi dab gaya
 Only a few months ago, Dalit youth were also demanding right to the street
 par is dauraan bhi congress soti rahi
 Rahul took the easy trio of three trios, the Congress cadre woke up when he rang
 gujarat main aanan-fanan rahul gandhi pahunche
 On coming to the electoral arena, Rahul instead of strengthening his cadre, took the easy path and resorted to a trio of hardik-alpesh-jignesh
 haalanki congress ko iskaa phayda bhi mila
 Just before the election, the wind was such that the BJP also began to doubt its victory for some time
 ek vakt aisa bhi aayaa ki pichley 22 saal se satta par kabiz bijepi ko congress kadi takkar detii dikhi
 Its effect was also such that in the first few hours of counting, the Congress was seen winning
 vipakshi dalon kii ankhon main chamakagujrat main bijepi jis tareeke se jiti he, usase 2019 main modi sarkaar ko takkar dene kaa khwab dekh rahe vipakshi dalon kii ankhon main chamak jarur laa di hogi
 That is why on coming to the Gujarat result, SP President and UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav filled the void that in 2019 we will give a tough competition to the Modi government
 akhilesh ne kar di pahankhilesh ne abhi se vipaksh ko ekajute karne kii shuruyaat kar di he
 In the past, he went to Kolkata to pursue this effort, to meet West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Modi's arch rival
 akhilesh ne gujarat kaa rigelt dekh kaha ki ‘thik he ki ham uttar pradesh main haare, gujarat ke yuva vahaan haare, lekin yah jaruri nahin he ki ham hameshaa haarenge
 There will come a time that the loser will win and the loser will win
 aane vaale vakt main aap dekhenge ki ham jeetenge or vah haarenge
 In 2019, we would like to form an alliance, but on what issues the alliance should be, it is most important
 2019 main mudde bhi hon or gathbandhan bhi ho to shaayad ek bada mahagathbandhan ban saktaa he
 


 If Omar Abdullah's point will be proved wrong, if the opposition's effort pays off, then the former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah may also prove to be wrong what he said when the UP election results are out
 umr ne salaah di thi ki sabhi vipakshi dal ab 2019 kii bajaae 2024 kii taiyaari karen
 The 'modi Magic' mixed everyone in 'khak', the way 'modi Magic' is going on in the last three and a half years, it is tearing up the opposition
 gujarat model ke brands ambesder bane modi kaa jawaab kisi ke paas nahin tha
 In the three and a half years, the same model and the same brand ambassador brought everyone into the limelight
 yah silsilaa kuch yun shuru hua ki maharashtra, haryana, jharkhand, jammu-kashmir tak main bijepi kii sarkaar bani
 Although the BJP lost in Delhi and Bihar, the mandate here came unilaterally
 uske baad assam, pashchim bengal, uttarakhand, upi main bhi janadesh ekatarfa hi aayaa
 If the Congress won in Punjab, the decision was one sided
 is fehrist main aaj gujarat or himachal bhi jud gaya
 But the Gujarat model which resonated in 2014, the same model faltered in Gujarat, the Congress was in a position to compete
 pehali baar gujarat ke chunaav parinaam ne congress ko ye ehsaas karaayaa ki agar vah taiyaari se lade hote to jeet sakate the
 Elections in four states next year, the BJP has also learned a lesson from this
 sikh he ki jab gujarat main congress bina taiyaari ke takkar de sakati he to phir 2019 kii bichhati bisaat itani aasaan nahin hogi
 While the Gujarat election result has awakened the Soi Congress, it has also alerted the BJP for elections to be held in four states next year
 haalanki jin chaar pramukh rajyon main chunaav hone hai usamen karnataka chhod den to rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main bijepi kii hi sarkaar he
 The opposition will have to decide now, if the opposition wants to win in the 2019 battle, then it will also have to be prepared from now
 yani kin muddon par koun kiske saath hoga
 Or you can also say that satraps have to come under the shadow of Modi or Rahul for their survival
 maujuuda vakt kii bisaat saaf batalaati he ki modi ke saath agar niteesha kumaar, prakaash singh badal, chandrababu naidu, mahabuuba mufti or paswan hai to duusari taraf rahul gandhi ke saath lalu yadav, akhilesh yadav, mamata banerjee, naveen patnayak, karunanidhi, sharad pavaar, faruk abdulla or auwaisi jaise netaa hai
 Where will the Shiv Sena go? Among all these, there is a party that will decide its role afresh in 2019
 vah he shivasena, jo kiske saath hogi yah philhal kisi ko nahin maaloom
 Rahul would like to bring Mayawati along with the Left and BSP
 telugana ke chandrasekhar raav ke kis disha main jaaenge, iskaa intjaar bhi karnaa hoga

 India and West Indies teams will play a decisive match of the three-match T20 series at the Wankhede Stadium
 siries is samay 1-1 kii barabari par he or isi kaaran yah match siries vijeta kaa faisla karegaa
 Fielding has been India's worst
 donon maichon main bharat ne kaich chode the
 Now that the third match is decisive, the focus of Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri will definitely be that the fielding of the team is better in this match
 vahiin, gendbaaji main bhi bharat ke liye chintaa hogi, kyonki koi bhi gendbaaj zyada prabhavi pradarshan nahin kar paaya he
 In the last match, Kohli can make a change here and give Mohammad Shami a chance
 test main damdaar pradarshan vaale shami ko is siries main mauka nahin mila he
 Which bowler he will replace will have to be seen
 spin main kuldeep yadav ko is siries main mauka nahin mila he
 One reason for this is that Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav have been seen as a pair to score runs apart from taking crucial wickets for the team in most of the middle overs
 ballebaaji main to sirf kohli kaa naam hi dikh rahaa he
 In the last match, all-rounder Shivam Dubey had scored a half-century, but whether he is able to maintain consistency in his performance is a question

 abhi bijepi or shivasena ke paas bahumat he, lekin agar shivasena or ensipi bhi saath ai to kya kuch sambhaavnaaen hai?bahumat ke liye – 145shivasena+bjp: 105+56= 161shivasena+ NCP: 56+54= 110bijepi+ NCP: 105+54= 159congress+ncp: 44+54= 98congress+ncp+shivasena: 44+54+56 = 154maharashtra ke chunavi nattejeyapako bataa den ki shivasena ne chunaav nateezon ke baad bhartiya janata party par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 In a press conference on Thursday, Uddhav Thackeray showed sharp attitude and said that he will proceed with the Bharatiya Janata Party on 50-50 formula
 saath hi unhone kaha tha ki abhi bhi bada sawaal hoga ki aakhir siem koun banegaa?press conference ke alaawashivsena ne saamana mukhpatr main bhi lekh ke jariye nishaanaa saadhaa he
 It has been written in Saamana that the results which have come, are not a grand mandate
 darasal, devendra fadanvis kii yatra kaa naam bhi mahajanadesh yatra tha
 But the results were not exactly what the BJP claimed
 1
 Rejecting all speculations, decrees and fatwas, a large number of Muslim voters in western Uttar Pradesh are reported to vote for the Samajwadi Party and the Congress alliance
 sau muslim ummidavaaron ko maidan main utaarne ke baavjood bispi musalamaanon kii pehali pasand nahin ban saki he
 The situation is that in all the seats of Budhana in Muzaffarnagar, where the Samajwadi Party has fielded Hindu candidates and Muslim candidates are contesting from the BSP - there are also a majority of Muslims voting for the Samajwadi Party
 boodhaana main sadak ke kinare papeeta bechney vaale mustakim apane booth par jaakar vot karne vaale karne vaale pehle matadaata the
 He openly states that he voted for the Samajwadi Party
 yah poochne par ki unhen hathi ke bajaay cycle zyada pasand kyon aayaa vah muskuraate hue bahut hi mjedaar jawaab dete hai
 His answer was - Elephants cannot come into the house and bicycle can come
 2
 The Muslim voters' tendency towards the Samajwadi Party in western Uttar Pradesh is a danger bell for Mayawati
 paramparaagat rup se yahi ilaaka bispi kaa majboot garh rahaa he
 Despite the Samajwadi Party's wave in the last assembly election, the BSP won seats equal to the Samajwadi Party here
 agar in 73 siton par bispi pichad jaati he to aage kii ladai uske liye behad mushkil ho jaaegi
 Muslims are 17 per cent in the whole of Uttar Pradesh while their population in western Uttar Pradesh is close to 26 per cent
 3
 The large number of Muslims getting votes in these areas of western Uttar Pradesh is an auspicious sign for the Samajwadi Party as it can hope that the same pattern will continue throughout Uttar Pradesh
 lekin pehle charan main muslim matadaataaon kaa acha samarthan paane ke baavjood inhen siton main tabdeel kar paanaa samaajawaadee party ke liye chunauti hogi
 The reason for this is that the population of Yadavas in these areas is negligible
 yahaan samaajawaadee party ke paas duusari koi aisi majboot jati nahin he jo yahaan ke 26 fisadi muslim voton ke saath judakar akhilesh yadav ko zyaadaatar siton par jeet dilaa de
 But if the BSP had got such support of the Muslims here, the Dalit would have joined the vote bank and laid the foundation for a spectacular victory of the BSP
 samaajawaadee party ke liye raahat kii yuva votaron main akhilesh yadav kaa craij dikhataa he
 4
 bijepi chaahe jo daawa kare jat matadaata bijepi se apni naaraazgi chipa nahin rahe hai
 Like the Lok Sabha elections, this time it is impossible for the BJP to get the full support of Jat voters
 shanivaar ko jin 73 siton par matdaan hua, unamem zyaadaatar siten aisi hai jahaan jat haar jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaate hai
 In most of the seats, the Jat vote bank was divided between the Rashtriya Lok Dal and the BJP
 gramin ilaakon main or khaas taur par umradraj jat voter bijepi ko sabak sikhaane ke liye rashtriya lok dal ko vot kar rahe hai
 At the same time, urban Jats and young people are still liking BJP more
 gaanv main rashtriya lok dal ko vot dene vaale kai jat matadaata khuleam yah kehete hai ki unhen is baat se matlab nahin he ki unka ummidavaar jitegaa yaa haaregaa unhen sirf bijepi ko haraane se matlab he
 5
 bijepi se jat votaron ke naaraazgi kaa sabase bada kaaran aarakshan nahin milanaa he
 In these areas of western Uttar Pradesh, the impression of Haryana is clearly visible
 isiilie haryana main jat aarakshan andolan ke dauraan 21 jaaton kaa maranaa log bhuule nahin hai
 The Jats feel that they used them in the Lok Sabha elections after the Muzaffarnagar riots but got nothing in return
 mujffarnagar shamali road par khard gaanv ke ek bujurg jitendra malik kehete hai ki narendra modi pakistan ke pradhanmantri ko to janmdin kii mubaarakabaad dete hai lekin jaaton ke sabase bade netaa choudhary charan singh ke janmdin par ek twit karnaa bhi unhen yaad nahin rahata
 6
 ajit singh kii rashtriya lok dal kai siton par jat vot bank main send lagaakar bijepi kaa khel kharaab kar rahi he
 But the Rashtriya Lok Dal itself will win only a handful of seats
 uski vajah yah he ki bijepi se naaraaz jaaton ke alaava duusari koi jati ajit singh ko vot nahin de rahi he
 7
 bijepi is baat kii ummid lagaae baithi he ki muslim votaron ke bich vibhaajan kaa phayda use milegaa
 But the first phase of voting will definitely increase his worries
 haalanki pashchimi uttar pradesh main savarna puri tarah bijepi ke saath hai
 bjp's attempt to make inroads among backward castes also appeared to be paying off
 lekin is baar dalit loksabhaa chunaav kii tarah bijepi ke saath aane ko taiyaar nahin he
 BSP is getting most of the votes of Dalits
 8
 There was speculation that not presenting the face of the Chief Minister would prove harmful for the BJP
 lekin jo log bijepi ke liye vot de rahe hai unase baat karke kuch or hi pataa chalata he
 Most people are still voting for BJP only in the name of Modi
 modi kii lahar loksabhaa chunaav ke tulana main kam jarur hui he lekin bijepi ko sabase zyada vot modi ke naam par hi mil rahaa he
 9
 mujffarnagar or aasapaas ke ilaako main bhi abhi dharmik aadhaar par dhruvikaran khatm to nahin hua lekin kam ho chukaa he
 Surprisingly, in the Muzaffarnagar riots, the most confrontation took place between the Jats and the Muslims
 lekin ab kai jagah par jat or musalmaan donon bijepi ko haraane ke liye vot de rahe hai
 10
 notebandi ko chunaav main jitna bada mudda mana ja rahaa tha utana asar jameen par dikhaai nahin detaa he
 The leaders are not discussing as much as the voters used to talk about the closure of notes in their speeches during the election campaign
 shahari ilaakon main voter kuch had tak notebandi kii dikkaton kaa zikr karte hai lekin gaanv main duusare mudde zyada haaavee ho chuke hai
 In western Uttar Pradesh, known as the sugar belt, the problems of sugarcane farmers are a big issue
 mujffarnagar shamali ilaake main haryana ke bahut se kisaan sugar mil main apana ganna lekar aa rahe hai
 The farmers are worried that if the farmers of Haryana sell their sugarcane by bringing UP for better price then where will they go with their sugarcane

 After this he started ignoring me
 main hameshaa kahati rahi- mujhase vaada karo, ek bivi kii izzat karo
 all the more
 
 
 saboot milane par shami ne meraa phone uthaanaa hi band kar diya
 Shami's wife got divorced in 2010, ex-husband told why the broken relationship Hassan Jahan said that Mohammed Shami's behavior changed after missing the mobile
 mobile haath nahin aata, to vah mujhe talaak kaa notice bhej chukaa hota
 Hasin Jahan said that Shami gave a chubby reply during a TV interview and tried his best to mislead the case
 isse pehle haseen jahaan ke purv pati safuddin bhi media ke saamne aa chuke hai
 Saifuddin, who lives in Siuri in Virbhum district of West Bengal, has said that Shami should prove her innocence
 saath hi unka yah bhi maananaa he ki donon saath baithkar baat kar len, to sara maamla sulajh jayega
 Significantly, Shami's wife has made several serious allegations against Shami including extramarital affairs, domestic violence
 kolkata police ne haseen jahaan kii shikaayat ke baad shami par ipisi kii saat dhaaraon ke tahat maamla darj kiya he
 Former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis started evacuating the Chief Minister's official residence in South Mumbai on Thursday

 View this post on instagramtoday was my last day on the sets of Yeh hai Mohabbatein
 Can't believe it's over and i won't get a call time for tomorrow to shoot
 About my journey in the show, it’s been beautiful, i have learnt so much and this show was a dream come true for me
 About Ruhi, Stepping into a character that's already important, established, well recognized and loved is difficult
 I’ve never said this before but it was a tough time when i had entered the show as there were people saying things like “ab toh show kaise chalega”, “ab show mein woh baat nahi rahi”, “show ko band karne ke liye leap liya hai” etc etc but i kept working and focused on my scenes
 The hate was so much in the beginning that i had shut my phone for a week so that i don't come across any such comments and get slightly affected also but surprisingly just after my first episode being telecasted, the reaction was totally the opposite of what i had expected The same people then accepted me, praised my work and brought me till here and now all i receive is LOVE❤️ i want to thank each and everyone of you who showed that belief and accepted towards me, it is only because of you guys that i have completed 4 years in the show when a week was seeming difficult
 a character that was hard stepping into is hard to let go off today
 Thank you to the entire team of YHM for giving me Ruhi and this beautiful family who has been so lovely
 Thank you Ruhi for making Aditi's life so beautiful

 do dashakon main pehali baar he ki bijepi or shivashena alag-alag chunaav lard rahi hai
 That is why it is being said that the credibility of both Shiv Sena and BJP is at stake
 haalanki is daud main shivesna aage nikalati dikh rahi he lekin bada sawaal abhi bhi kaayam he ki kya shivasena ko bahumat milegaa
 If you look at the trends at 3 pm, Shiv Sena is leading in 92 seats, BJP 77 seats, MNS 6 seats
 227 sadasyeey biemasi main bahumat ke liye 114 siton kii jarurat he or abhi tak aae rujhaanon ke mutabik shivasena 92 siton par bijepi aage chal rahi he
 Shiv Sena MP and leader Sanjay Raut, while giving a statement on the gains made by the Shiv Sena in the Municipal Corporation elections in Mumbai, said that it has been found out who is the boss of Mumbai
 unhone kaha, 'mumbai kaa bos koun? shivasena or uddhav thakare
 Not only this, he also advised the BJP that the BJP should investigate its defeat transparently
 unhone aarope bhi lagaaya ki sattadhari dalon ne rajya main sthaneey nikaay ke chunaav main satta kaa durupyog kiya he
 Shiv Sena currently has these options out of which Shiv Sena can hold one
 
 1- Will Shiv Sena go with BJP? After Sanjay Raut's advice to the BJP to examine itself in the fall, it seems that both the two poles will remain and will not come together but if this alliance happens then it will be the easiest path for Shiv Sena
 vaise bhi raajnneeti main kuch bhi sambhav he to yah opshan bhi hameshaa bijepi ke paas khulaa hi hua he
 The comments 2- doosraa vikalp he shivasena congress kaa haath pakad le
 If the Shiv Sena goes with the Congress, it is seen getting support for 29 seats (according to the 3 pm data)
 yadi yah gathbandhan hota he to shivasena ke saath ensipi bhi aa sakati he or tab use 7 siten, 3 baje ke aankadon ke mutabik, ensipi se bhi mil sakati hai
 3- As a third option, it may be that Shiv Sena can take over the hand of MNS and the Nirdli
 3 baje ke aankadon ke mutabik, 14 siten anya ko milti dikh rahi hai

 madhya pradesh ke damoh main ek dalit mahila sarpanch dharne par baithi hai
 The case is not to let him hoist the flag in the panchayat on 15 August
 mahila sarpanch ke mutabik rajya ke kaddavar mantri jayant malaiya or unka betaa lagaataar unhen pareshaan kar rahe hai
 Action is being taken to remove him from the post of sarpanch without any concrete investigation and notice
 jile ke colector or panchayat vibhaag ke adhikari mantri ke ishaare par use kanoonee pachadon main ulajhaa rahe hai
 The sarpanch, a severely accused woman sarpanch on the state's finance minister, is sitting on a dharna in front of the collector office demanding justice, she tells the people passing through that whether it is the state government or the Center talks about the upliftment of the two Dalits, but the reality Is exactly the opposite
 dharne par baithi is mahila sarpanch kaa naam puna bai ahirwar he
 Poona Bai has been elected sarpanch from Bandakpur village
 salbhar se use panchayat main apane kaamkaaj ko lekar kaaphi jaddojahad kerani pad rahi he
 Delay in appointment despite the court order, when he announced the flag hoisting on August 15 last year, he was stopped from hoisting the flag on 13 August 2015, just two days before Independence Day, on the order of the Collector
 puna bai ne colector ke aadesh ko kamishnar ke nyaayalay main chunauti di
 After a nearly year-long hearing, on 21 July 2016, the commissioner revoked the order of the collector and directed Poona Bai to hold back the post of sarpanch
 puna bai kaa aarope he ki is aadesh ke jari hone ke baad local vidhayak or rajya ke cabinet mantri jayant malaiya phir sakriy ho gaye hai or use sarpanch ke pad par niyukt nahin karne ke liye prashasan par dabaav bana diya
 Therefore, the Collector has not yet issued orders for his reinstatement
 15 agast ko jhanda fahraana chaahati hai puna bipuna bai panchayat bhawan main jhanda fahraane chaahati he
 So she is sitting on a dharna in front of the collector's office to execute the order of the commissioner
 peedit mahila sarpanch puna bai kaa aarope he ki vitt mantri or unka betaa nahin chahta ki wo sarpanch rahe
 Poona Bai is the sarpanch of Bandakpur village, which is adopted by MP Prahlad Singh Patel
 puna bai ne maamle kii shikaayat saansad se bhi kii he
 Everyone got away from citing investigation
