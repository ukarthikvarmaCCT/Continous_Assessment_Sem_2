 jabaki nepali congress ke 114 sadsy hai
 Due to the demise of some mps and the termination of parliamentary membership of some, there are currently 594 mps in Parliament, and 298 votes will be needed to win the election

 We have direct concern with many of them
 
 
 kaiyon se paala nahin padaa hota he
 
 
 Those who fall, understand about them only
 
 
 pehle to gas or telephone conection kii bhi filein chalaa karti thim
 
 
 Power meter installation file
 
 
 in filon kii taadaad ghati he, kyonki ab filon kii jagah 'melein' chalane lagi hai, khaastaur se privet daftaron main
 
 
 Here files do not proceed, mail is forwarded
 
 
 iske apane gun-dosha hai
 
 
 Many times pendings are put in the box
 
 
 sho aiz anared
 
 
 Many times are immediately forwarded
 
 
 file laane-le jane vaale chaparasi kii bhi zarurat nahin
 
 
 Just send mail
 
 
 vaise, kai baar mail bhejkar ittila bhi karnaa padataa he - 'did you si maai mail
 
 
 I've Just Saint to You
 
 
 ' mail par hi sara kaam hota he
 
 
 Others also have their own names
 
 
 kuch ise mail kaa khel kehete hai
 
 
 Leave the mail - talk on that world once again
 
 
 abhi ham baat kar rahe hai filon kii
 
 
 The speed at which files run depends on the character of the file owners
 
 
 filon kii speed ghataane-badhaane ke peeche inaki kuch apni chaalen hoti hai
 
 
 Sometimes those moves are straightforward, but sometimes they are said to be twisted
 
 
 ek kiraani duusare ke paas bhejtaa he
 
 
 Second near third
 
 
 teesraa phir pehle ke paas
 
 
 Many seasons occur in this cycle
 
 
 filon ko aage badhaane ke liye chadhaave kaa bada chakkar he
 
 
 At the clerk level, this round can be anything from 10 to 10,000
 
 
 isamen bichauliyon kaa bhi bada role hota he
 
 
 The file that does not move beyond rubbing your shoes increases as you bring these middlemen in between
 
 
 ye bade export hote hai
 
 
 What is the file or which officer has the file, it is not known that they grumble immediately, they say that 'I know him, he is very big, he will not listen without giving, see what you can do
 
 
 ' Files are also small and large
 
 
 bade level kii file par chakkar bhi bada hota he
 
 
 There the level of interest is different
 
 
 ambani ke sez kii file mulaayam badhayen to alag baat hoti he
 
 
 Separate if Mayawati stopped
 
 
 phir mayawati bhi file aage badwa den to kahani badal chuki hoti he
 
 
 Whatever be the case, but the files of capitalists like tata-birla, ambani-adani never stop
 
 
 unki filon kii kapiyaan bhi kai hoti hai
 
 
 One is stuck, and the other goes on
 
 
 bengal main atakati he to haryana main aage bad jaati he
 
 
 From Gujarat it flourishes and reaches Delhi
 
 
 sarkaar badalane ke saath kai baar filein kholi or band bhi kii jaati hai
 
 
 If there is a file for investigation and prosecution, then the closure of loved ones, opened political opponents
 
 
 'fakkadon' kii file kii tasviir alag hoti he
 
 
 As the file progresses, his life is tied
 
 
 or jahaan kisi tarah kaa bandhan ho, vahaan file tezi se kaise move kar sakati he
 
 
 She eats the dust, asks for recovery, and goes missing if not found
 
 
 dhundhane par bhi nahin milti
 
 
 If found, then the elder Babu would not have been signed
 
 
 'file abhi nahin dekhi he, file mere paas nahin ai he, pataa karo, file kahaan he
 
 
 'like answers
 
 
 jabaki file vahiin kahin hoti he, or aamtaur par vahi afasar file ko vahiin dabaae baitha hota he
 
 
 So the files are suppressed as well
 
 
 puri na sahi, usamen se kuch record gaayab bhi ho jate hai
 
 
 Many times, offices are set on fire and files are burnt
 
 
 kuch bachataa hi nahin
 
 
 What will you do?

 Bollywood actor Naseeruddin Shah's comment about the superstar (late) Rajesh Khanna's performance has been hot again
 mashhoor script riter or salmaan khan ke pita saleem khan ne ek twit main rajesh khanna ko apane jamaane kaa aisa lokapriy abhinayta bataaya he jiske ghar ke baahar prashansakon kii baari bheed jamaa hoti thi
 The sequential tweets Salim Khan has made about Rajesh Khanna's popularity are considered to be answers to Naseer questioning his (rajesh Khanna's) ability in a way
 naseer ne ek angreji akhbaar ko diye intervyuu main filmon ke str girane ke liye rajesh khanna ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 He had said, 'it was the 70s when Hindi films became average
 yah us samay kii baat he jab rajesh khanna ne bollywood main apana kadam rakhaa tha
 He was very successful, but for me he was a very limited actor
 vastav main vah ek 'kamjor abhinayta' the
 Of all the people i have met, he was not intellectually aware
 unke khud ke test ne industry par shashan kiya
 Reacting to this comment by Naseer, Twinkle, the daughter of former film actress and Rajesh Khanna, said, "sir, if you can't give respect to the living, then respect the dead person
 kamajori to us vyakti par hamalaa karnaa he jo jawaab nahin de saktaa
 However, Twinkle closed the controversy after Naseeruddin Shah apologized in the case
 unhone twit ke jariye kaha tha, 'ab bahut hua
 The matter has gone a long way, we have all put forward our view
 ab sab pokamon khilne ja sakate hai
 Comments baharhaal, saleem khan ke twitus ke baad yah maamla phir charchaa kaa centre ban gaya he
 It is worth noting that Salim Khan, along with Javed Akhtar, has written scripts for many famous Bollywood films, including 'sholay', 'deewar', 'kala Patthar' etc
 saleem ne likhaa, ek actor mere gelexi apartment sthit ghar se niklaa or dekha ki badi sankhya main prashansak mere bete salmaan kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 The actor called me and said that he had never seen this before
 duusare twit main saleem likhte hai, 'maine is actor ko bataaya ki main isse adhik bheed film star rajesh khanna ke ghar ke baahar dekh chukaa hum
 He was the first and last superstar of this millennium
 ' saleem khan ne aage likhaa, 'unhen ausat str kaa abhinayta bataane vaale kisi bhi vyakti ko pataa hona chahie ki kuch asaadhaaran kiye bagaiyr koi bhi is oonchai par nahin pahunch saktaa
 a look at Salim's tweet

 unhone kaha tha, 'yah 70 kaa dashak tha jab hindi filmon kaa str ausat ho gaya tha
 It was a matter of time when Rajesh Khanna made his foray into Bollywood
 vah bahut safal hue, lekin mere liye vah bahut hi simit abhinayta the
 In fact he was a 'weak actor'

 Frustration and bitterness are difficult to cure but carrying the same for such a long time is unheard of uttar pradesh main asli jang chhid chuki he
 All the projections about Priyanka Gandhi's roadshow are now the test of reality
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki unhone priyanka gandhi or jyotiraditya sindhiyo ko uttar pradesh main agali sarkaar banane ke iraade se bheja he
 But questions are being asked that even if the ace of Priyanka's name does not work? You must have heard about forgetting the differences and coming under one roof, but when the wheel of politics goes from the midnight of Jeth to the back of Amavas Have to come on top of a bus, not under one roof
 priyanka gandhi wadra kaa waajid ali shah ke shahar main kuch yun swaagat hua ki hawaii adde se pradesh congress mukhyalay tak jis tarah se log umade, uskaa andaja uttar pradesh main 7 fisad vot paane vaali congress ko bhi na rahaa hoga
 In this enthusiasm, Rahul Gandhi said the thing on which observers of politics can only smile
 rahul ne kaha ki maine priyanka or sindhiya ji ko yahaan kaa general secretary banaaya he
 i have told them that Uttar Pradesh has to fight against the injustice that has been happening for years and bring a justice government in UP
 inkaa lakshya loksabhaa ke saath-saath vidhansabha chunaav main congress kii sarkaar banane kaa bhi he
 Meaning Priyanka Gandhi is the trump card for Rahul Gandhi, that is, the last leaf after which nothing else
 lekin raajnneeti main asambhav kii sadhana kaa prasad vahi nahin hota jo maanga jaataa he
 Sometimes it is understood
 aise main sawaal he ki priyanka gandhi kya asaliyat ko samaj rahi hai

 com / bvdydjlsax— Congress (@incindia)february 11, 2019priyanka gandhi ko party ko durdin se nikaalane ke liye kamjor haath die gaye hai
 Neither do they have leaders, nor activists, nor caste equations nor encouraging issues
 matlab priyanka gandhi ko shunya se shuruyaat kerani he
 Weak organization is the Congress will not be able to do anything by sitting through the first difficulty, but it will not be so easy to achieve what it wants to achieve despite being restless
 sabase badi mushkil to kamjor sanghathan he
 When the Congress came to power in 1989, the entire organization collapsed under the rise of regional parties
 chunaav dar chunaav kaaryakarta espi-bispi kii ore mudate chale gaye
 The presence of the Congress on a major issue has remained negligible in Uttar Pradesh
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main apni haisiyat congress dekh hi chuki he
 In such a situation, it is too early to expect Priyanka that she can form the government in UP
 pichley chunaav main samaajawaadee party ke saath milakar congress 105 siton par ladi thi
 It won only 7 in the 403-member assembly
 netaaon kaa akaal duusari mushkilpriyanka gandhi ke saamne duusari mushkil he netaaon kaa akaal
 Most of the strong leaders of the Congress have moved to SP-BSP or BJP
 jagdambika paal or reeta bahuguna jaise puraane netaa tak bijepi main hai
 Congress is in a bad shape in Sonia Gandhi's own constituency Rae Bareli
 vidhayak rakesh pratap singh or emelsi dinesh pratap ne party chhod di
 Zilla Panchayat President of Rae Bareli left Congress last year
 priyanka gandhi purvi uttar pradesh kii prabharee hai
 The most difficult is in this Purvanchal, because Purvanchal is now the strongest fort of BJP
 jatiyon main bante pradesh ko samajhnaa or sadhanapriyanka gandhi ke saamne teesri mushkil he buree tarah jatiyon main bante uttar pradesh ke samaaj ko samajhnaa or sadhana
 dalit-muslims who were with the Congress are now with the SP-BSP
 kabhi brahman vot congress ke saath tha, lekin ab bijepi kii naav par wo savaar he
 It is not easy to understand the political equation of UP divided among castes
 darasal, priyanka gandhi ko asaadhaaran paristhitiyon main ek asambhav yuddh ko vijay ke sambhav main badalane ke liye utaara gaya he
 But what will happen if this bet does not work? america ke raashtrapati baraak obama ke liesuraksha ke jo abhootpurv intjamkie gaye hai yakeen maniye is dharti main aisi duusari misaal dhunde nahin milegi
 Obama's aircraft Airforce One has such a technique that no radar is able to see its shadow while flying in the sky
 agar phir bhi agar koi air force van kii pojishan koi jaan le, to ise nishaanaa bananaa aasaan nahin
 Because the airplane through which Air Force One passes, two American Air Force planes are flying forward to keep it empty
 agar kisi ne peeche se air force van par missile daagi to iske cockpit main maujuud chaukanne payalat ko missile kaa signal mil jaataa he
 After receiving the signal, the pilot simply has to press a button
 jiske baad air force van se nikalataa he aag kaa aisa gola, jo missile ko gachha dekar use tabah kar detaa he
 Just understand that wherever the feet of Obama are going to be, there are miles around him with eyes on every corner
 obama beshak 25 janvari ko tadake dilli pahunchenge magar unki hifaazat ke liye unki sena ke hajaaron jawan pehle se hi har us jagah ke chappe-chappe ko khangaal chuke hai yaa khangaal rahe hai jahaan unke kadam padane vaale hai
 However, basically the responsibility of the security of the President rests with the US agency USSS ie United States Secret Service
 inke agent hameshaa saadi vardi main raashtrapati ke aasapaas maujuud rahete hai
 Behind dark glasses, their eyes are always focused on the people around the president
 inke kot par lage microphone or kaan main lage yearpys ke jariye ye hameshaa security control room ke sampark main rahete hai
 Secret Service agents never close their coat buttons
 taaki jarurat padane par inke haath chhipe hue hathiyaar taaki bijli kii teji se pahunch paaen
 The real responsibility of the security of the US President is on the shared team of secret service, CIA and American army whose people always keep a close watch on the President from the ground, the sky and the sea
 ye sabhi surakshakarmi ek network ke jariye hameshaa security control room se juden rahete hai
 They also have arrangements to deal with any kind of chemical, biological or nuclear attack against the President at all times
 america suraksha ghere ke baahar kii suraksha kii jimmedaari bhartiya kheme kii he
 Apart from the best officers of Mumbai and Delhi Police, Obama's security will also have the presence of Quick Reaction Teams, SWAT, NSG, SPG Commandos, Paramilitary Force, Dog Squad, Bomb Prevention Squad, CBI, IB and intelligence agency RAW

 They wear crosses, burn candles, make Christmas trees, sing their religious songs and even praise their religion by congratulating Christmas
 ye sari gatividhiyaan islam ke khilaaf hai

 Taking a dig at Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, who has been called 'feku' in social networking, Union Minister Manish Tiwari said that the Limca Book of Records would not need to include the 'feku of the year' award in its list
 soshal netwarking site twitor par kiye gayi kuch twit main gujarat ke vikaas kaa shrey lene or ding maarane ke kaaran modi ko # feku kii sangya di gayi thi
 Information and Broadcasting Minister Tiwari made the remarks in a seminar after the release of the 24th special edition of the cinema-based Limca Book of Records

 ’baad main jab mediakarmiyon ne unke bhaashan main istemaal kiye gayi shabd ‘feku’ ke bare main poocha to tiwari ne kaha, ‘svarnim shabd baar-baar nahin doharaaye jate

 But it is not our job to react to every news or to confirm every news
 ’ unhone kaha ki rahul or pradhanmantri manmohan singh pehle hi is mudde par party kaa rukh saaf kar chuke hai
 Asked about the bjp's internal report of polarizing the votes of the minorities in favor of the Congress by presenting Modi as the Prime Ministerial candidate, Tiwari said that the Congress had nothing to do with the internal differences of the opposition party
 tiwari ne kaha, ‘is mudde par rahul swayan, pradhanmantri or party ne apane vichaar vyakt kar diye hai
 So there is no more to add or subtract
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘hamen bijepi kii adanruni bahes, matbhed, sangharsh se koi lenadena nahin he
 Reacting to this, the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh (shivraj Singh Chauhan) has said that the BJP is being made fun of for the ongoing race for the post of Prime Minister
 ’kendriya mantri ne kaha, ‘jab unke khud ke mukhyamantri aisa soch rahe hon to hamaare liye kehane ko kuch bhi nahin rah jaataa
 Regarding the question raised by LK Advani in his blog about the action taken after the white paper brought by the government last year about black money, Tiwari said that the questions from the concerned ministry were answered will go
 unhone kaha, ‘adwani ji sansad main kaary sthagan prastaav laaye the
 After that, i was given responsibility by the Congress to speak on this issue and the government had put all the facts on the floor of the House
 uske baad yadi adwani ji or vipaksh ke paas koi sawaal he to uskaa jawaab jarurat padane par sambadhit mantralay dwaara diya jaayegaa
 On the remarks made by BJP President Rajnath Singh in a TV interview about Rahul Gandhi's record in politics, Tiwari advised Singh to focus on his party's affairs
 unhone kaha, ‘maine jab antim baar suna to rajnath singhji bijepi ke adhyaksh the
 Therefore, if he takes care of the affairs of his own party, it will be good for him
 unki party main andruni yuddh chhidaa hua he
 Every kind of trend is being seen in his party and it can be called separatism due to lack of good word
 ’rajnath dwaara modi ko dharmanirpeksh netaa bataaye jane par tiwari ne kaha, ‘yah hamaare liye mahatvaheen he kyonki kuch faisle is desh kii janata ne pehle hi dekh liye hai

 party ne jeet ke bade-bade daawey karke yuva morcha ke netaa aniruddh chandel ko apana ummidavaar banaaya
 Laxmikant Bajpai, Chandel's nomination, many prominent leaders including Legislative Council leader Hriday Narayan Dixit had arrived
 lekin do din ke bheetar hi chandel kaa bijepi se mohabhang ho gaya
 On the afternoon of 17 February, he secretly reached Lucknow Collectorate and withdrew the nomination in favor of SP candidate Sunil Yadav Sajan
 natijatan saajan nirvirodh jeet gaye
 Chandel was not only involved in his happiness, also took a photo of him with his fingers making a winning mark
 do varsh pehle apane sahyogi ke saath upi kii 73 sansadeey siten jeetne vaali bijepi kii saakh emelsi chunaav main dharashayi ho gai he
 After the Lok Sabha elections, the party, which claimed to have more than one crore members in UP, could not find even 36 such faces, due to which all the vacant seats of MLC could be contested
 mushkil se party do darjan se kuch zyada siton par ummidavaar khoj pai thi
 Three of these nominations were overturned after filing of nominations and some did not even reach the nomination
 haalat yah he ki 36 main se bijepi keval 21 siton par hi lard rahi he (dekhen box) or baaki par apni pratidwandvi or sattarudh sapa ko walkover de diya he
 This is the first such incident in up's political history

 On 14 February at 1
30 pm, senior BJP officials from Agra were informed about the appointment of Tejendra Pratap Singh as the candidate through SMS

 15 farvari kii dopaher teen baje tak hi namakan hona tha, lekin dopaher dedh baje ke baad tejendra jaise hi ghar se agra colectrate ke liye nikle, shastripur se unka apharan kar liya gaya
 After the nomination time passed, the kidnappers left Tejendra in the jungles of Keetham around 4
45 pm
 report sikandra thane main darj hui, lekin baat-baat par bakheda machaane vaale bijepi netaa apane ummidavaar ke saath nahin the
 The whole story becomes suspect due to no evidence of kidnapping by the police

 The SP also got a walkover in the banda-chitrakoot-hamirpur seat

 Like the assembly elections, the candidates were not given any financial support from the party in this election
 is kaaran un ummidavaaron par daanv lagaaya gaya, jo chunaav kharch khud uthaane main sakasham the
 The BJP proved to be a novice after nearly 12 years fighting MLC elections from the new authority

 Betting on the defectors, in an interview to India Today in May last year, UP BJP in-charge Om Mathur had said that if a person from other party is able to win the election then there is no harm in making that candidate

 Amidst many contradictions, the BJP has given full force to not allow the SP leader Narendra Bhati, who was involved in controversies related to the Durga Shakti Nagpal case and Dadri incident, to reach the Legislative Council from Bulandshahr seat

 Fights of leaders before elections: The MLC election has brought mutual discord among BJP leaders to the surface

 His allegations have stirred the state BJP
 vahiin dikshit kehete hai, “sakshi maharaj ko aarope siddh karne chahie
 The BJP leadership and the public are well aware of us
 ”pradesh bijepi ke bade netaa bhale sakshi maharaj par aakraamak na hon lekin pradesh pravaktaa aai
 P

 He says, “sakshi Maharaj has become a burden on the BJP

 "on the other hand, there has been an uproar in Meerut after the MLC election candidate was overturned
 kirakiri hone ke baad bijepi ke kshetreey adhyaksh bhupendra singh ne party ke viruddh shadyantr rachane or anushaasanheenata kaa aarope lagaate hue notice jari kiya he
 The party is also preparing to take action on the role of regional general minister Jaykaran Gupta behind the inclusion of SP leader Virender Yadav in the BJP

 If the MLC election is to be considered a rehearsal for the next year's assembly elections, then many diseases of BJP appear to emerge simultaneously

 23-year-old Jabna Chauhan, who holds her voice high, is the youngest sarpanch of the country
 saal 2016 main saadhe 22 saal kii umr main unhen himachal pradesh ke mandi jile kii tharajun gaanv kii sarpanch chunaa gaya tha
 These daughters, without father, are not 'abla', the mother has brought up difficulties and life is full of struggles
 unka janm garib ghar main hua
 His father was a farmer and brother blind
 ghar kii aarthik haalat aisi nahin thi ki vah padhane ke liye shahar ja sake
 However, girls were not allowed to go outside and study in their village
 lekin padhane or aage badhane ke junun main jabana ne mandi ke degree college main admician liya, jo uske ghar se kaaphi dur tha
 For 3 years of college, he traveled 18 km daily on foot and 2 km on bus
 iske baad unhone ek newspaper ke daftar main typing sikhi or vahiin parttime naukari karne lagi
 After some time he joined the local news channel
 raajnneeti ko mana samaaj kaa sudhaarjabna ko vaise raajnneeti main koi khaas dilchaspee nahin thi
 But to eliminate problems like drug addiction and illiteracy from his village, he participated in the panchayat elections in the village
 is faisle ke kaaran jabana ko kai baar logon se taane bhi sunne ko mili
 The hope of Bihar was not known to the English, know how the Businesswoman of the Year, but the high spirits did not let her lose
 unke gaanv main chunaav se pehle adhik vot paane ke laalach main sharaab baantne kaa chalan tha lekin unhone gaanv waalon ko saaf kah diya tha ki vah aisa bilkul nahin karengi
 Let me tell you that winning among the five candidates won the highest number of votes
 ye hai jabana ke sapaneladakiyon kii shiksha ke liye college banvaanaa, gaanv ko saaf rakhana, logon ko bijli, pani jaisi moolbhoot aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karana hi jabana kaa sapana he
 She wants to free the people of the village from drug addiction, in which the administration is getting full support
 jharkhand kii raajnneeti phir garma gai he
 Hatia assembly constituency, which remained vacant for nearly two years after the death of Congress MLA Gopal Sharan Nath Sahdev from heart attack on June 28, 2010, is ready for by-election on June 12
 is upachunaav kaa rajya kii arjuna munda sarkaar ke astitv par koi taatkaalik asar nahin padane vaala he
 The Munda government has the support of 45 mlas in the state's 82-member assembly
 is kshetra main jeet se virdohi dalon ko sirf pratikatmak taur par raahat milegi
 It is also worth noting that now whoever is elected MLA from this area will have to face re-election in the next two years
 in sabake baavjood hatiya up-chunaav ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This election, more than the candidates, will affect the careers of the veterans who pursue them
 is upachunaav main nishchit rup se sabase bada daanv kendriya paryaton mantri subodh kaant sahay kaa laga hua he
 He has been successful in getting his younger brother Sunil Sahai a Congress ticket from here, who is hoping to win this battle on the basis of his brother's political wealth
 lekin unki raah aasaan nahin he
 The announcement of the Congress to fight them has stabbed many other leaders of the party interested in the ticket and many of these leaders will only work in the way of junior assistant
 hatiya vidhansabha seat us ranchi loksabhaa kshetra kaa hi hissaa he jahaan se subodh kaant sahay saansad hai
 Therefore, if the result is not as favorable as expected, then it will not only shock his reputation, but his election prospects of the future will also be clouded with apprehension
 rajya main congress ke liye bhi yah mushkil daur he
 Of the 14 Lok Sabha seats in Jharkhand, Ranchi currently has only one seat in the party's account
 loksabhaa chunaav hone main ab do saal se bhi kam samay bachaa he, aise main congress or sahay donon hatiya main kisi tarah kii sharmindagi kii sthiti ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 However, in Hatia, Sunil Sahai is not the only candidate who stands on the political plane of his brother
 duusari ore, chotanagpur rajavaade se taalluk rakhane vaale ajay nath sahadev bhi is vidhansabha seat ko viraasat ke taur par hasil karne main koi kasar nahin chhodana chaahate, jahaan se unke chachere bhai gopal sharan nath sahadev 2009 main vidhansabha chunaav jite the
 Ajay Nath contested from Hatia on a Congress ticket and won by a narrow margin of just 25 votes over Ramjilal Sarada of BJP
 lekin is baar junior sahadev babulal marandi ke jharkhand vikaas morcha (jhavimo) ke tikat par chunaav lard rahe hai
 Being the deputy mayor of Ranchi, it seems easy for Sahdev to win this election
 jhavimo ne 2009 kaa vidhansabha chunaav congress ke saath milakar ladaa tha, par hatiya upachunaav main usne congress ko samarthan se inkaar kar diya
 The BJP has fielded Ramjilal Sarada from here
 unki kai yachikaaon kii vajah se hi yah upachunaav do saal tak lataka rahaa
 There was also a re-counting of votes in December 2011, but despite this, the only way to hold fresh elections was left
 is vajah se hi sthaneey vidhayak kii maut ke kareeb do saal baad hatiya vidhansabha main upachunaav hone ja rahaa he, jabaki aam taur par kisi vidhansabha seat ke khaali rahane par chunaav chah maah ke bheetar hi ho jaataa he
 While the opposition parties are against each other, the ruling NDA is also divided over Hatia seat
 up-mukhyamantri sudesh kumaar mahato ke netritv vaali ajasu party sarkaar main bhaajapa kii saajhedaar he, lekin usne bhi yahaan se naveen jaiswal ko khadaa kiya he
 Naveen finished third in the 2009 election
 haal main sampann rajyasabha chunaav main ajasu ne jhamumo kaa samarthan kiya tha jisaki vajah se uske pratyaashee sanjeev ku maar vijayi hue the
 Now Sudesh wants Jummo to support his candidate in return
 udhar, bhaajapa chaahati he ki jhamumo uske pratyaashee ko samarthan de
 In such a situation, the crack of alliances of both power and opposition has come to the surface
 bharat desh sanskaar or sabhyataaon kaa desh mana jaataa he
 The tradition and customs here have a distinct identity
 shaadiyaan bhi yahaan sabake alag-alag rivaaj se hoti hai, phir chaahe lovemerigeho yaa arange
 If you have chosen your spouse then it is fine otherwise then the elders of the house here choose your spouse for you
 lekin kitna ajeeb he kisi aise ke saath nayaa jivan shuru karnaa jise aap jaanate tak nahin
 So it is important that if you are going to arrange the marriage, then know and understand some things beforehand
 aaie jaanate hai ki kya he wo 5 khaas baaten
 1
 samay-seemaa nirdhaarit karen-jab bhi aapke ghar ke bade aapke rishta kisi se tay karen, to turant shaadi ke bandhan main naa badhen
 Before marriage, be sure to spend some time with your future spouse so that you can understand them
 2
 Do not hide anything - if you have a relationship with someone before marriage, then do not hide from your future spouse at all
 aapaki aane vaali jindagi sukh se beete iske liye behatar he ki aap aapane partner se kuch naa chhupaayen
 3
 aarthik saajhedaari-shaadi se pehle hi aapako apane partner kii saileri jaan leni chahie or apni inakam bhi unhen jarur bataa deni chahie
 This will make sense in your relationship
 4
 Spend time with the family as well - spend some time with the family of whom you are going to get married
 shaadi do pariwaron ko aapas main jodatii he, isliye ek duusare ke parivaar waalon ke saath bhi aapako samay bitaan chahie
 5
 apni icchhaaen jarur jaahir kar den-shaadi se pehle hi apane partner se aapke dil main kya he jaahir kar den
 Do tell them what you want or want after marriage
 kahin ghoomane jane chaahate hai yaa phir kuch nayaa kaam karnaa chaahate hon, sabhi bate apane partner ko jarur bataaen

 Former BSP MP Narendra Kashyap has joined BJP
 buudhvaar ko bhartiya janata party ke upi adhyaksh keshav prasad maury or upaadhyaksh evam prabharee om maathur kii upasthiti main kashyap party main shaamil ho gaye
 Significantly, last year, Narendra Kashyap was arrested in the murder of his daughter-in-law Himanshi
 giraftaar ke baad narendra kashyap ne kaha tha ki unhone bahu ke saath kabhi kuch galat nahin kiya he
 Himanshi was shot dead in suspicious circumstances
 himanshi kaa shav gajiabad main unke ghar ke bathroom se mila tha
 a case of dowry and murder is registered against Narendra Kashyap and his son
 basapa ne apni chhavi ko daagdar hone se bachaane ke liye kashyap ko party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya tha
 He was trying to go to SP or BJP for a long time
 2014 main centre main sarkaar banane ke baad bijepi ne party kii image kii chintaa chhod chunaav jeetne par zyada jor diya he
 This is the reason that many other party leaders have entered the party in the last two and a half years
 upi kii tarah hi uttarakhand main bhi vijay bahuguna, harak singh ravat samet 11 vidhayak bijepi main shaamil hue the jisamen se adhiktar vidhayakon par bhrashtachar se lekar anya kai gambhir aarope the
 This clearly shows that the BJP has come down on the strategy of sam-daam-dand-bhed to win the elections
 shahrukh khan pichley kuch samay se imtiyaaj ali or anand el raay jaise nae diarectors ke saath kaam karte nazar aae hai

 At a time when every young or middle-aged star is talking about the focus on content, films like 'stree', Andhadhun, Tumbad are making great collections at the box office, along with great scripts, from Mouth Publicity on social media
 The business of films is being affected, even at such times Salman's stardom remains the same

 unhen pataa he ki ve bacchon or pariwaron ke bich lokapriy he
 Therefore, they often appear in positive characters with a clean image with less scope for shades

 He clearly says - 'I make films so that my fans go to the theater and have a good time

 athavle is din pradhanmantri narendra modi ko kaledhan ke khilaaf ection ke taur par hajaar or 500 ke noton par pabandi lagane ke liye dhanyavad denge
 In Maharashtra, the black money and white money day, the same opposition parties have declared November 8 as 'black day'
 mumbai congressnotbandi keek saal puure hone par jagah-jagah virodh pradarshan karegi
 Athawale's party will celebrate 'white Money Day' on 8 November and will organize various programs in favor of demonetisation in many parts of Maharashtra
 notebandi kii prashansa karte hue athavle ne kaha ki ambedkar ne bhi har das varshon main karency badalte rahane kii salaah di thi
 Athawale's advice to Jignesh and Hardik is that the RPI (A) is giving its support to the BJP in next month's Gujarat elections
 athavle ne dalit netaa jignesh mewaani or patidaar netaa hardik patel secongress keebajaae bijepi ko samarthan dene kii apil kii he
 Athawale said, 'I am ready to play the role of mediator between Hardik Patel, Jignesh Mevani and BJP on the issue of Kota
 ' Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, who is already preparing for the Lok Sabha elections, has put another member of his family, Akshay Yadav, from Ferozabad Lok Sabha seat and entered politics
 uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti ke sabase shaktishaalee yadav parivaar ke akshay saatven sadsy hai jinhone sakriy raajnneeti main dastak di he
 Akshay Yadav is the nephew of SP chief Mulayam Singh and son of the party's national general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav
 mainpuri se saansad mulaayam ke alaava rajyasabha sadsy ram gopal yadav, uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav, uttar pradesh sarkaar main mahatvapurn vibhaag sambhaal rahe cabinet mantri shivpal yadav, kannauj se saansad dimpal yadav or badaayun se saansad dharmedra yadav sahit yadav parivaar ke chah sadsy pehle hi sakriy raajnneeti main hai
 Akshay's official entry into electoral politics was sealed with the announcement of 55 candidates for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections on Friday
 party ne akshay ko apana paramparaagat seat firozabad loksabhaa seat se chunavi akhaade main utaara he, jahaan chunaav main unka muqabla congress se vartmaan saansad raaj babbar se hoga
 Akshay, 26, says he has been active in Firozabad for the past few years
 vahaan ke log or party kaaryakartaaon ne unase chunaav ladane ke liye kaha jiske baad unhone chunavi raajnneeti main utarane kaa man banaakar party netritv ke samaksh tikat ke liye daavedaari pesh kii
 Firozabad, known worldwide for the manufacture of bangles, has been a traditional parliamentary seat of the SP and Yadav families for years
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main akhilesh yadav ne yahaan se chunaav jeeta tha lekin kannauj se bhi jeet darj karne ke kaaran unhone yah seat chhod di thi
 In the subsequent by-elections, SP had fielded Akhilesh's wife Dimple from here, but lost to Congress candidate Raj Babbar by a huge margin
 sapa ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha ki party netritv ab apni is paramparaagat seat par phir se kabja chahta he
 That is why Akshay, a member of the family, has been made a candidate from here
 akshay bhale hi abhi tak sakriy raajnneeti main na rahen ho lekin unhone 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mainpuri se chunaav ladane vaale apane taaoo mulaayam ke chunaav prachaar kaa puraa jimmaa sambhaala tha
 Apart from this, during the by-election in Firozabad seat, he also played a significant responsibility in the election management of sister-in-law Dimple
 udhar, apane ek or bhattije akshay yadav ke raajnneeti main pravesh ko lekar aane vaale dinon main mulaayam ko vipakshi dalon ke hamale sahane padenge
 Significantly, in politics, Mulayam Singh, who once strongly criticized the Congress for promoting familyism, called himself the father of socialism
 ram manohar lohia kaa jhandabardaar bataate hai, jo khud raajnneeti main parivaarwaad ke kattar virdohi the
 Samajwadi Party state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary says that the party always gives tickets to deserving candidates
 vaise bhi mulaayam singh yadav parivaar kaa jo bhi sadsy raajnneeti main aayaa he janata ne use jitakar parivaarwaad ko badhaava dene jaisi baton ko niraadhaar sabit kiya he
 Although big leaders and ministers used to stage Asaram, but Asaram has started becoming villains to many such people
 khud gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii najar ab asaram par tedi ho gai he
 The Modi government has given notice to several Asaram ashrams in Gujarat to vacate the land
 ye notice un sabhi ashramon ko jari kiya gaya he, jin par gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se sarkari jameen hadapney kaa aarope he
 The evacuation of several hundred acres of government land in Junagadh ashram called 'mini Haridwar' has also started
 junagarh kaa ye ashram 15 saal pehle bana tha
 It is alleged that the government land was captured without any kind of government approval
 gauratlab he ki us daur main modi ke pasandida police adhikari diji vanjaaraa tab junagarh ke espi the
 DG Vanzara is also an ardent devotee of Asaram, but he is currently in jail as an accused in the fake encounter case

 "in a copy of the letter from IANS, Yadav has earlier referred to the advice sought by the President from the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha he ki varsh 1951 lekar ab tak ke kareeb sabhi maamalon main sarvocch nyaayalay ne ek saal ke bheetar apni raay jaahir kar di he
 In this letter sent last week, Yadav has appealed for immediate intervention to resolve the water dispute between Punjab and Haryana

 " Former captain Sourav Ganguly believes that the Indian cricket team has reached a low level in Test cricket and they have not seen such a team in the last 10 years
 bhartiya khilaadi test shrunkhlaa main ab tak bilkul bhi lay main nahin dikhe
 In addition to batting poorly in the third Test, the team also bowled poorly and also took catches
 england ne pehali pari ke aadhaar par bharat ke khilaaf 486 ran kii badhat hasil kii
 After being bowled out for 224 in the first innings, India gave England a chance to score 710 for seven, after which the hosts declared the innings
 bharat ke saamne ab match, test shrunkhlaa or apni number ek ranking bachaane kii chunauti he
 Ganguly, one of India's most successful captains, said in an interview to the BBC special program on the Test match, "I agree with (this criticism) and we should accept that we were ordinary
" sabase kharaab din guuruuvaar (doosraa din jab bharat ne 90 over main keval teen wicket hasil kiye, jabaki england ne 372 ran banaae) tha
 i have not seen such an Indian team in the last 10 years
 shrunkhlaa main pehle hi 0-2 se pichad rahi bhartiya cricket team teesraa test bhi haarane kii kagaar par he
 The players of the team have been accused of fatigue and lack of interest in Test cricket, as they can earn much more by playing in the IPL
 lekin ganguli kaa maananaa he ki taiyaari kii kami ke kaaran shrunkhlaa main bharat kaa pradarshan kharaab rahaa
 This former player who became a commentator from cricket said, "you cannot win a match against a good team only by getting on the field
" unhone kaha, mujhe lagata he ki jab ham upmahadweep kii team england, australia yaa dakshin africa jate hai, to hamen do abhyaas match kii jarurat hoti he
 And a few months ago when he went to England, Australia, he played three practice matches and also kept the stand by players
 bharat ne england ke khilaaf shrunkhlaa kii shuruyaat se pehle sirf ek abhyaas match khelaa tha
 Ganguly, however, insisted that the end of the England series would not be the end of the careers of players like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman
 unhone kaha, hamen sardiyon main australia kaa daura karnaa he or dravid, tendulkar or lakshmana ko vahaan le jane kii jarurat he
 "this is the first series in the last seven or eight years in which we have performed poorly," he said
 yah sirf ek shrunkhlaa he, jisamen bharat acha pradarshan nahin kar paaya
 Ganguly, however, said that it is disappointing that a player of Tendulkar-like potential has looked ordinary so far
 unhone kaha, lekin haa, yah niraashajanak he, kyonki ham bhartiya is daure ko lekar kaaphi utsuk the
 Players like Dravid and Tendulkar take great pride in performing here
 ganguli ne kaha ki nae coach dancan flechar ko shaayad dressing room main bade khilaadiyon se saamanjasy baitaane main dikkat ho rahi he, lekin ek baar sab kuch lay main aane ke baad coach ke liye yah kaam aasaan ho jayega

 The organization claims that crores of rupees coming from the central government in the name of 10,33,197 Anganwadi centers are being misused in the state
 kya he maajaraa
 
 
 According to the RTI organization, considering the existing parameters, 35 beneficiaries are placed in every Anganwadi center and accordingly every Anganwadi center running in the state should have the same number of beneficiaries
 lekin rajya main is niyam kii dhajjiyaan udayi gai hai
 RTI activist Balvinder Singh says that not only did he visit many Anganwadi centers in the state, but the response he received from the government also shows that many Anganwadi centers in the state have less than 35 beneficiaries
 jabaki in kendron ko 35 labhaarthiyon ke hisaab se rashan or duusari anya chijen di jaati hai
 RTI activists are claiming that most of the names in the list of beneficiaries being submitted to the central government are fake and they are demanding an inquiry into it

 " Varanasi MP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced to celebrate Handloom Day on August 7, so that this heritage of India can be carried forward
 pradhanmantrinarendra modi ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi ke handloom udyogka jayja liya gaya, to chaunkaane vaali hakeekat saamne ai
 The handloom industry in Varanasi is on the verge of dying
 is dhandhe main lage bunakar banaras se roji-roti kii talash main duusare shaharon kii ore palaayan kar rahe hai, jisamen gujarat bhi shaamil he
 Varanasi is undergoing a tremendous slowdown in this business at this time
 yah mandi tab se shuru hui he, jab se narendra modi bharat ke pradhanmantri bane hai
 Varanasi is not only identified with the Ganges, it is also famous for its Banarasi sarees
 kisi bhi hindu parivaar kii beti kii shaadi bina banarsi sari pahanaae nahin hoti
 Weavers are mostly Muslims
 aise hi karigar hai ek mohammad ashraf ansaari
 Her sari knitting is a family profession
 inke ghar main kabhi 10-12 karghe hua karte the, lekin ab sirf 1 bachaa he
 The bank also has a loan over them, which has not been able to deposit its installments for the last 10 months
 ashraf kaa kahana he ki halaat agar yahi rahe, to jaise baaki bunakar banaras chhodkar bhaag rahe hai, ve bhi apane parivaar ko lekar yahaan se nikal lenge
 In Varanasi alone, the number of weavers is 2 lakh, while directly or indirectly 10 lakh people are associated with this business
 sutron ke mutabik, saal bhar pehle varanasi main hathkarghon kii sakhya lagbhag 50 hajaar thi, jo ab ghatakar 35 se 40 hajaar ho gai he
 On the other hand the number of machine-operated powerlooms is increasing
 udhar market main jabardast mandi he, jisase bunakaron kaa taiyaar maal gaddi par hi rah ja rahaa he
 Its buyers are not being found
 market pehle bhi kharaab tha, lekin pichley ek saal se halaat bad se badtar ho gaye hai
 The weavers do not understand why this is happening? It is not that no efforts are being made for the betterment of the weavers
 khaskar narendra modi ke banaras se saansad banane ke baad bunakaron kii behatari ke liye kai saare skiimon kaa elaan kiya gaya he, jisamen mega cluster craft village or bunakaron ko sidhe bank se jodne kii yojanaon kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also announced a Trade Facilitation Center in Jayapur, Varanasi, from where weavers will be able to sell their goods directly to customers from abroad
 lekin tamaam ghoshnaaon ke baavjood halaat kharaab hote ja rahe hai
 The government is also very concerned
 uskaa kahana he ki aise prayaas kiye ja rahe hai, jisase bunakaron kaa palaayan ruk sake
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has targeted the BJP in the latest statement
 unhone kaha he ki raajnneetik phaaydon ke liye modi jhooth failaa rahe hai
 The former PM further said that he is not even taking care of the dignity of constitutional posts for the benefit of the party, he should apologize for this
 ravivaar ko banaaskantha ke palanpur main ek chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue modi ne aarope lagaaya tha ki gujarat ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke varisht netaa seemaa paar se madad se le rahe hai
 With the attack on Congress, Modi had asked that why are people in Pakistan holding high positions in Army and Intelligence talking about the help of making Ahmed Patel CM in Gujarat? Modi asked, what does it mean? The Congress retaliated
 congress netaa anand sharma ne yahaan kaha ki gujarat main 'spasht haar' dekhakar pradhanmantri niraash (frestate) ho gaye hai or khud ke prati sahanubhuti jagaane ke liye 'kharaab bhashaa kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 Modi had alleged a day earlier that the Congress party and Pakistani elements are working together to defeat the BJP in Gujarat
 gujarat main ravivaar ko ek saarvajanik jansabha main modi ne yah bhi kaha tha ki congress netaa manishankar ayyar ne unke khilaaf neech shabd vaali tippanee apane awaas par raat ke khaane ke baad kii thi
 This dinner at Iyer's residence was attended by Ansari and Singh besides former Pakistan Foreign Minister Khurshid Kasuri and the current Pakistani High Commissioner to India
 sharma ne kaha, 'aaj pradhanmantri niraashaa main hai or spasht haar se logon kaa dhyaan hataanaa chaahate hai
 The Prime Minister should withdraw his words, maintain the dignity of his office and apologize
 'sharma ne media se kaha, 'agar unke paas aisi koi jaankaree he, to yah ek gambhir maamla he
 The country will not tolerate the tactics being adopted by the ruling party to win elections unfairly
 hamen puraa vishwaas he ki gujarat ke matadaata budhimaan hai or paryaapt paripakv hai or kal (ravivaar ko) jo bhi hua uske peeche kii ranneeti (modi dwaara) ko jaanate hai or vah apana jawaab duusare charan main unhen denge
 He said that what could be more absurd than what the Prime Minister said on Sunday
 unhone kaha, 'pradhanmantri se apanebhaashanon main sanyamitahone kii ummid kii jaati he, unhen hameshaa yaad rakhana chahie ki unke paas ek ucch pad he or unhen un hastiyon par aise aarope nahin lagane chahie, jinhone ucch sanvaidhanik padon ko sambhala he or samarpan or patibaddhta ke saath bharat kii seva kii he
 Sharma said that Modi's allegations against the former Vice President and former Prime Minister of India are extremely irresponsible, unfair and condemnable
 unhone kaha, 'pradhanmantri ko yah yaad rakhana chahie ki ek saamaajik samaaroh main bhaag lenaa jisamen ucch ganmaanya vyakti upasthit the
 There is not a secret meeting
 baithak main bhartiya sena ke purv pramukh, bharat ke purv ucchayukta, prasiddh patrkaar sabhi upasthit the
 He said that the Prime Minister is giving it a frightening and sensational turn
 pradhanmantri ko raajnneetik bhaashan kii garima ko behaal karnaa chahie or purv up raashtrapati or purv pradhanmantri se maafee maangani chahie
 Sharma said that it is clear that he did this with the intention of confusing the people of Gujarat
 unhone bhaawanaaon ko bhadakaane or dhruvikaran ke liye aisa kiya he
 There can be no other explanation and nothing more condemnable than what they did
 sharma ne kaha ki modi ne baar-baar aisa karke raajnneetik bhaashan ke str ko itnaa neeche gira diya he ki jo sab kuch ho saktaa he lekin sammanjanak nahin
 He asked, 'why doesn't he talk about progress, the country's economy
 vah pradhanmantri hai, bade daawey karne ke liye jane jate hai, aaj vah kisaanon ke bare main baat kyon nahin karte? vah rojgaar, yuvaaon ke bhavishya ke bare main kyon baat nahin karte? unka kya agenda he, ve kis aadhaar par chunaav lard rahe hai?'unhone kaha, 'unke apane bhaashan, unki party kii galat bhashaa
 The Prime Minister is trying to awaken the sensation in front of people by saying that he has been treated unfairly while it is himself who has done wrong to the people
 'pakistan ke saath congress netaaon kii mileebhagat ke modi ke aarope par sharma ne kaha, 'yah apmanjanak he
 They should know that the Congress led the freedom struggle, which was opposed by the forefathers of the party from which Modi belongs
 unhone angrejon kaa saath diya tha or mahatma gandhi ke bharat chodo andolan kaa virodh kiya tha
 He (modi) is the heir of one such group
 ' BJP National Spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain, in Aaj Tak's special program Mumbai Manthan, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said, "do not abuse me, but do not compare us with Babur

 Owaisi said connecting them with the Mughals
 shahanvaj ne kaha ki babar baahar ke desh se hamaare yahaan aayaa, ham use apana nahin maan sakate
 You can abuse Shahnawaz, but do not call Babar's partner
 unhone kaha ki agar kisi ne tajmahal, lalakila banaaya to kya ham badale main unhen apana mulk de denge
 He said if the British formed a parliament, would they give them the country
 jisane somnath par hamalaa kiya kya wo hindustan se mohabbat karata tha

 shahanvaj hossain ne kaha ki mughalon ne agar tajmahal banavaane kaa order de diya lekin banaaya to hinduon ne hi to kya ham unke naukar ho gaye
 The BJP leader said that Owaisi Sahab lives on Ashoka Road, the British built his house, will it be buried under his favor
 shahanvaj ne kaha ki ham tajmahal nahin banaaenge lekin garibon ke liye ghar banaaenge
 Owaisi said that the slogan of BJP is that Muslims are children of Babur, 1200 years of slavery
 bijepi abhi bhi gulaami ke daur se baahar nahin nikali he
 Owaisi said that i do not consider the Mughals to be aggressive, those who were born here and died here, you cannot call them an attack
 desh main jain, buddha dharm kisne khatm kiya
 Many Mughals were born in this country
 hindu maa kii pet se mughal paidaa hue the
 These are part of our history
 hindustan main jo apper cast he wo aryan he, ab aryan kya hindustan ke hai?ovaisi ne kaha ki babar vahaan se aaen jahaan par pradhanmantri phool chadha kar aae
 Where were Shah Jahan, Akbar, Jahangir born, who would you question? shahanvaj ji to musalamaanon main bhi apper cast ke hai, to bataaen ki ye kahaan ke hai
 Owaisi said Shahnawaz Hussain, 'your party did not say what about the Red Fort, but even today the tricolor has to be waved from there
 'unhone kaha ki agar aap mughalon se achche hai to ek tajmahal banavaa do, petrol sasta kar do, dijal sasta kar do
 The British built my house but my elders never wrote an apology to the British nor did they beg for their lives

 After failing in Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistani intelligence agency ISI is now preparing a new plan
 iesai ab bharat-nepal border par lashkar-e-taiyaba ke modul kaa jaal bicha rahi he
 According to intelligence received by Aaj Tak, ISI has given full responsibility to build the module to Omar Samas alias Omar Madani, commander of the sleeper cell in Lashkar Nepal
 umr madani bharat-nepal border ke tarai ilaake main muslim yuvaaon kaa brainwash karne main juta he
 Lashkar has established a base in Kapilvastu, Nepal for its operation
 lashkar commander umr madani nepal border aria se brainwash kiye yuvaaon ko pakistan bhejne kii firaaq main he
 Following the intelligence report, security forces were alerted along the indo-nepal border
 nepal ke jariye aatanki ghuspaith or aatanki modul ko paalane or posane kaa kaam paak kufia agency lagaataar karti rahati he
 Intelligence sources have informed Aztak that Maulana Omar Madani, a suspected let operative in Nepal's Morang district, is trying to spread anti-india activities by building a new module
 kufia sutron ke mutabik lashkar-e-tauyaba se judaa moulana madani "nepal ajukational and welfare socity" ke jariye bharat virdohi gatividhiyon ko dhadlle se failaa rahaa he
 The intelligence agency has said in its report to the Ministry of Home Affairs that Maulana Madani is seeking funds from abroad through his NGO in some Nepal districts bordering Nepal border
 sutron ke mutabiq is fund kaa istemaal madani border aria ke bhole bhaale yuvaaon ko lashkar main shaamil karne ke liye brainwash kar rahaa he
 Intelligence agencies have also pointed out how foreign money from Nepal route is coming to Nepal's NGO and using this NGO to radicalize Madani Muslim youth to join Lashkar
 aatankwaad ko sangrakshan dene vaale pakistan ke liye 1751 kimi main khuli bharat-nepal kii seemaa sabase mufid rahi he
 This is the reason that the dreaded terrorists prefer this route more than Bagha or other borders
 kyonki ye border khulaa he haalanki kii esasabi is border kii suraksha main rahati he par aatanki kai baar ghusane kii koshish main pakade jate hai
 In the last three decades, dozens of dangerous terrorists have been caught on the indo-nepal border
 suraksha agenciyaan apni har report ke bharat-nepal seemaa ko ati samvedansheel bataa chuki hai
 Nepal, India's friendly country, is proving to be a terror for terrorists
 is baat kii tasdik 1991 main hui jab sonauli border par punjab kaa ugravadi sukhwinder singh dabocha gaya tha
 Militants named Ajmer Singh and Bhag Singh were caught on indo-nepal border in Siddharthnagar
 1993 main mumbai cond kaa aaropee tiger memon bhi sonauli border par hi dabocha gaya
 Apart from these, the Pakistani terrorist Jabbar who conducted his activities from Nepal was arrested by the ATS in Lucknow
 jabbaar bhi nepal seemaa ke raste hi bharat ke ghusaa tha lekin suraksha agenciyon ke hathe chadh gaya tha
 Not only this, a dangerous militant of Babbar Khalsa was caught in Makkan Singh Barhani (siddarthanagar)
 bharat-nepal seemaa par hi desh ke liye khatra bane top aatankiyon main shumaar abdul kareem tunda ko dilli police ne dabochne main kamyaabi hasil kii thi
 Then the Indian Mujahideen's dreaded terrorist Yasin Bhatkal was caught on the border of Nepal
 oktober 2016 main dow-javed naam kaa ek sandigdh paak neshnal pakadaa gaya tha
 On 13 May 2017, Hizbul terrorist Nasir Ahmed Wani was arrested by the security forces
 kuch maheene pehle ajtak ko khufia sutron ne jaankaree di thi ki iesai nepal kii sena main chupchaap nae tareeke istemaal kar ghuspaith karne kii koshish main lagi hui he
 For this, Pakistan's intelligence agency and its army are building National Defense College in Kathmandu, capital of Nepal
 china kii tarz par pakitan nepal se nazadiiki badhaane kii koshishon main laga hua he
 So that it can reduce India's influence in Nepal
 suraksha mahakme ke sutron ke mutabik pakistan kathmandu main neshnal dephence college bananaa chahta he jisase wo nepal kii sena main apni paith majboot kar sake
 According to intelligence agencies, while Pakistan wants to build a National Defense College in Nepal, the Pak High Commission in Kathmandu is also running the anti-india Propaganda
 suraksha agency se jude ek adhikari ke mutabik pakistan or nepal ke bich neshnal dephence college banane ko lekar pichley kuch dinon main kai round kii meeting ho chuki he
 Pakistan has been continuously strengthening its diplomatic relations with Nepal in the last few years so that it can reduce India's influence
 pichley dinon ek kufia report main ye kaha gaya tha ki pakistan nepal main bharat virdohi aatanki guton kii madad karne main laga hua he jisase aatanki nepal or bharat kii khuli seemaa kaa phayda uthaa kar bharat me daakhil ho sake
 According to the security agencies, the Pakistan intelligence agency ISI has laid a lot of net in Nepal
 is pakistani khufia agency ne hi bharat virdohi gatividhiyon ko sanchalit karne ke liye ek baar phir lashkar ke modul ko shah dekar muslim yuvaaon ko kattarpanthi banane kii koshishon main juta he
 However, Indian security agencies and intelligence agencies are on alert about this suspected module of Lashkar

 America has said that Pakistan is a paradise of terror and gives shelter to terrorist organizations
 zaahir he kisi azaad mulk ke liye duniya ke sabase tacover mulk kaa aisa kahana behad gambhir baat he
 But the question is that after seeing Pakistan, how did the paradise of terror become? Who are those people who put a free country into the furnace of terror? We will tell you how Pakistan became a terrorist place
 aatank kii jananath he pakistanpakistan yani paak-sthaan, matlab paak jagah, land of fair pipul
 This is the real meaning of Pakistan
 paak farsi shabd he jabaki sthaan hindi
 Pakistan was formed by combining these two words
 par ab? ab kya he pakistan? 'aatank kii jananath he pakistan' ji haa
 Now not only India but the world's most powerful country also says that Pakistan is the paradise of terror
 or jab america aisa bolen to use halake main nahin linna ja saktaa
 Through the Country Report of Terrorism, the US Interior Ministry has made it clear that Pakistan now openly terrorizing terrorist organizations like Taliban, Haqqani Network, lashkar-e-taiba, jaish-e-mohammed and jamaat-ud-dawa The paradise has been formed
 pakistan main pal rahe aatankiduniya ke sabase taqatvar desh america ne bhi maan liya he ki pakistan main aatanki pal rahe hai
 America also believes that Pakistan is the paradise of terrorists
 pakistan ko 'aatanki raashtra' ghoshit karegaa america? aatank ke chure se hindustan par ghaat lagane vaala mulk khud usase ladane ke naam par america or duniya kii ankhon main dhul jhonkne main naakaamayaab rahaa
 Now his real face is exposed
 jis america ke dam par pakistan khud ko bephikr samajhataa he
 Now the same America has exposed the reality of Pakistan to the world
 haalanki ye pehali baar nahin he, jab america ne pakistan ko aatankiyon kii jananath kaha he
 Pakistan has a refuge for terrorists, so has the Pakistani soil now become a paradise for terror? After all, how did a whole country get caught in the clutches of terror? How terrorist organizations and their masters captured an entire country? Before you know the answer, remember any injured city in India, listen to the groans of Mumbai, 93
 sabase hare zakhm pathankot kii aah mahasoos kiijie
 Remember the names of terrorist organizations and their masters
 desh ke sabase bade bhagaude don ke bare main sochie
 Consider the end of the world's largest terrorist before Baghdadi
 kashmir main jhankie
 After this, your tone and American lyrics will not be different
 kyonki sachmuch aatank kii jananath ban chukaa he pakistan
 Pakistan cannot hold anyone else responsible for terrorism
 kyonki jo usne boyaa he vahi aaj kaat rahaa he
 Osama bin Laden, the world's biggest terrorist, was hidden in his home in Abbottabad
 kashmir par buree najar daalane ke liye paak adhikrut kashmir main aatankwaadiyon ko paidaa kiya
 Lashkar sheltered Hafiz Saeed
 jaish ke chif moulana masood ajahar ke sir par haath rakhaa, afghanistan se bhaage to pakistan main taliban ke liye jameen muhaiyaa karai
 shia-sunni fight for politics
 or bharat kaa most waantand don daaud ibrahim jab mumbai main 93 karke hawa hua to use bhi apni god main chupa liya
 ISI and Army run Pakistan, if so many Aman and humanity enemies are together in a country, what else would it be called the birth of the country? Yes, if you want to make a paradise of terror from Pak place, you can be treated with someone, then just Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Shreef
 wo bhi kya karen
 The whole of Pakistan and the world knows that the Pakistan Army and the ISI only operate in that place
 in donon se takaraane kaa matlab kya hota he ye pakistan ke saare siyasatdan jaanate hai
 From General Ayub to General Ziaul Haq and then to General Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan before and after Pakistan
 par sach jaanane ke baad bhi ye sawaal hameshaa uthta he ki aakhir pakistan ne apane paak sthaan ko aatank kii jananath banane hi kiyon diya?jo boyaa, vahi katapurani kahawat he ki insaan jo bota he, vahi katata he
 The story of the neighboring country, which was badly scorched in the fire of terror, is similar
 pakistan main alag-alag vakt par alag-alag hukmaranon or fuj ne aatankwaad ko apane-apane phaayde ke liye istemaal kiya
 Now the result is that the same terrorism is bashing Pakistan for the most part
 pakistan ko mili ye jakhm21 disambar 2007, peshawar kii masajid main fidaayin hamale main 50 logon kii maut hui
 On 1 July 2010, a fidayeen attack on the donor court of Lahore killed 50 people
 2 november 2014, wagha border par jhande kii rasm ke dauraan fidaayin hamalaa hua, jisamen 60 logon kii jaan chali gai
 On 16 December 2014, the Army School of Peshawar was attacked by the tehreek-e-taliban, which led to the painful death of 145 school children
 20 janvari 2016, bacha khan ooniwarsity, peshawar main aatanki hamale ke dauraan 25 bachche maut ke munh main samaa gaye
 Whenever a terrorist attack takes place anywhere, no one knows exactly where the list of such terrorist attacks and deaths in Pakistan starts and ends
 isaki vajah bhi sidhi si he ki pakistan main kab kahaan kaise or kidar se aatankwaadi hamalaa ho jaae, ye naa to vahaan kii police ko pataa he, naa suraksha agenciyon ko or naa hi gaddi par baithe siyaasi hukmaranon ko
 This is the reason that today the world has started calling Pakistan as a paradise of terror
 haalanki ek haqiqat ye bhi he ki apni zamin par aatankwaadiyon ko panaah dene vaala pakistan ab khud hi iskaa sabase zyaada shikaar ho rahaa he
 But knowing all this, agencies like Pakistani rulers, army and ISI are not serious against terror for their own purpose
 balki kabhi wo khud ko aatankwaad kaa shikaar bataa kar ronaa rone lagate hai or kabhi dusron par ilzaam madh dete hai
 In such a situation, tomorrow will be happy for Pakistan, for now there is no hope of this

 hamane iran ke parmaanu kaarykram par kisi samjhaute par pahunchane par chal rahe hamaare prayaason ko lekar charchaa kii
 ' media ko bayaan main unhone kaha, ‘neuyark main maine jo kaha vahi raashtrapati ruhani ko doharaaya
 There will certainly be some significant hurdles in moving forward and success is not guaranteed
 
 Despite this, i believe we can arrive at a holistic solution
 ’’ obama ne iske baad samvaadadaataaon kaa or koi sawaal nahin liya
 In a statement to the media, he said, "I repeated what President Rouhani said in New York
 aage badhane main nishchit taur par kuch mahatvapurn baadhaaen hogi or safalataa kii guarantee nahin he
 
 iske baavjood, meraa maananaa he ki ham ek samgr samaadhaan par pahunch sakate hai
 Obama did not take any further questions from reporters after that
 viechpi ke atanrarashtriya sangrakshak ashok singhl ne ayodhya main mandir nirmaan ko lekar ek baar phir bada bayaan diya he
 He made it clear on Wednesday that there is only one way out of court settlement in the case that the Muslim Personal Law Board should withdraw its claim on Ram Janmabhoomi, Krishna Janmabhoomi and Kashi Vishwanath
 singhalane apni baat rakhte hue aage ek aisa bayaan de diya he, jisapar siyaasi shor machana tay he
 Singhal said, 'muslims shout brother in and out of court, but still they cannot be brothers
 agar vah chaahate hai ki hamaare desh main bhai-bhai kaa naaraa dilon main based to yah kaam tabhi ho saktaa he, jab vah teenon sthanon par apana daawa chhod den, varna dil nahin mil sakate
 Singhal further said, "we have directly said to withdraw the claim
" ram janmabhumiper krishna janmabhumi par or kaashi vishwanath par apane daawey waapas le lo
 The cordial relations between Hindus and Muslims that did not last for hundreds of years can be converted into sweet relations
 lekin iskaa sirf yahi ek rasta he
 "stone of humiliation on chest" VHP Netane said that thirty thousand temples were demolished in the country
 hamane lakhon bana liye
 We have nothing to say for the rest of the temples
 unhone kaha, 'ye teen mandir jo tode gaye the, vah hamaare seene par apmaan kaa bahut bada pathar hai
 Due to this, there is a lot of pain in the people, so there can never be a good relationship
 madhur sambandh kaa ek hi rasta he ki teenon sthanon par wo apana daawa chhod den
 Don't fight too much
 bahut ladaai lard chuke
 Now create new history, i have to say this to the Muslim Personal Law Board
 ' In Sambhal, Uttar Pradesh, police arrested six persons for allegedly betting for IPL matches
 police ne kaha ki ravi kumaar, govinda, pradeep kumaar, arun kumaar, vikram or monu raghav ko ipel match ke dauraan giraftaar kiya gaya
 He said that a case has been registered against him
 inke paas se chaar mobile phone, ek tivi set or 2000 rupee kii nakad raashi jabt kii gai
 Bihar is losing by itself
 chunaav main do main se koi ek gathbandhan to jeet jayega lekin is chunaav main bihar kii haar tay hone ja rahi he
 Never seen such a purposeless and mild election
 har taraf aniatik gathbandhan hai
 All these things will not have any effect on people, because the arguments have been fixed according to caste
 baaki kaam jatiyon main send lagaakar puraa kiya ja rahaa he taaki unki nishtha main daraar aa jaae
 That rift is not going to come from arguments now, it can come from riots
 isliye sampradayik jhagade ho rahe hai or karaaye bhi ja rahe hai taaki ilaake main ghatana ko lekar bahes ho or bahes karte karte log hindu musalmaan main badalane lagen
