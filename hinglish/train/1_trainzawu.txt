 He told us, "we are going to start shooting for a suitable boy tomorrow

 koi kahata he chhedchhad yaa prem prasang bhi kaaran he
 But there is an attempt to divert attention or to get wrapped up in some other issue

 It is expected that the police will also bring concrete evidence in favor of whatever story is revealed

 There is no end to hatred within our society about religion nor caste, politics understands this, so it keeps pouring ghee in this fire

 Three people are acquitted including Kaushalya's mother but Kaushalya is about to appeal against her mother

 If Shankar's death is the face of our society, then Kaushalya's sending his father to jail for life is also an example

 Was reporting the incident in Bihar newspapers
 yahi likhaa he ki ghatana ke kaarnon kaa pataa nahin chal sakaa he
 Apart from Telegraph, The Wire Hindi, Wire English, Prabhat Khabar, this news has appeared in many newspapers
 police adhikari eke trivedi ne jaanch shuru ho chuki he to kaarnon ko lekar police ke bayaan kaa intazaar kiya ja saktaa he
 In The Wire, Javed Iqbal has written that two different massacres take place in Bhagalpur within a week
 donon ko lekar raajnneetik pratikriya main antar bihar main jati kii raajnneeti ke bare main bahut kuch kahata he
 There is not even a nominal reporting of the incident of a Dalit family being cut off in the mainstream media outside Bihar
 padosi ke liye bhi asambhav rahaa hoga ki unhen hamale kii jaankaree na hui ho, phir bhi koi kuch baat nahin kar rahaa he

 Javed Iqbal has written when Gayatri Ram's elder son Santosh told that he grabbed his feet, folded his hands, asked all the neighbors, nobody said anything
 main do dinon se kuch khaaya nahin hum
 Everyone asked what happened but nobody said anything
 kanik ram jis basti main rahete hai vahaan 70 dalit ghar hai, magar us samaaj se bhi koi himmat nahin juta paa rahaa he ki aakar gavaahi de yaa kuch kahe
 Are people of other societies also unable to muster courage? kya jati ke saath sab khadey rahanaa chaahate hai yaa phir unhen police par bharosa nahin he
 Kanik Ram has three sons and a daughter
 do bete batch gaye hai
 a son labors outside and slept on the pond the night of an incident
 kya hatyaron ko apane saamaajik, raajnneetik yaa dharmik aadhaar par itnaa bharosa hota he ki ve system ko manage kar lenge
 Once the investigation is postponed for five years to ten years, then everything is managed
 is ghar main rahane vaala kanik ram urf gayatri ne aakhir kiskaa kya bigaad liya hoga
 20,000 were found under Indira Awas Yojana, half the unfinished house is built
 khidki nahin he, daravaaza tak nahin he
 They must have been dying from their own poverty, why did those who killed them commit such cruelty? hatya ke paanch dinon baat tak farsh par koon bikharaa rahaa
 a blood-stained pillow remained scattered in the corner
 chuulhe par khaanaa pakaa bhi nahin tha, pak rahaa tha jab hatyaron ne hamalaa kiya
 Different arguments are being given
 machhlee mafia kaa kaam bataaya jaataa he
 Kanik Ram Talab used to work on contract
 haal hi main usne kai logon ke saath milakar kisaanon se ek talab yani jalakar kharida tha
 Some say that molestation or love affair is also the reason
 magar dhyaan bhatakaane yaa kisi or masale main lapet dene kii koshish ho rahi he
 Some are giving communal color and some are casteist
 isi tarah ke anek baaten karte karte sara maamla hi gol ho jaataa he
 Dalits have so much power that political parties consider them as vote banks, otherwise no one goes to meet them

 On 3 December, a day's hunger strike took place at the railway station of Bihpur block
 logon ne loktantr main apni awaz uthaane kaa farz to nibhaa diya, lekin kya is bheed main kanik ram ke hi samaaj ke log the yaa us samaaj ke log bhi the jinke bare main kaha ja rahaa he ki hatyaron kaa sambandh unase ho saktaa he

 On one hand, three people are brutally murdered in a Dalit colony, but none of the 70 houses in their locality are able to speak, the upper castes of the village do not come in favor of that Dalit, but a Dalit was killed in Tamil Nadu So in protest, only the daughter of the parents who murdered her stood up
 kaushalya ne apane mata pita ko maaf nahin kiya
 Our colleague Uma Sudhir has reported the matter
 es kaushalya ne ve shankar se pyaar kiya or shaadi kii

 Kaushalya left her parents' house after the incident
 coimbatore main pati ke maa baap ke saath hi rahane lagi
 Kaushalya was given a government job after the incident

 Kaushalya will have to give herpes ek saal se kuch zyada vakt to laga magar faisla aa gaya
 Tirupur district court sentenced six people to life imprisonment in this case
 teen log bari hue hai jinamein kaushalya kii maa bhi he magar kaushalya apni maa ke khilaaf apil karne vaali he
 Everyone should be told about this adventure of Kaushalya
 shankar kii maut hamaare samaaj kaa cheharaa he to kaushalya kaa apane pita ko aaajeevan jail bhijwa dena bhi ek misaal he
 Kaushalya has said that December 12 is a historic day in honor killing cases
 jati kii hinsa ke khilaaf na ham sakht ho sake na dharm kii hinsa ke khilaaf
 But nobody misses politics about violence
 karnataka main ek aisi hi ghatana saamne ai he
 Politics is taking place in Hanover, North Karnataka over the death of Paresh Maista, a young man
 raajnneeti alag he lekin kya police peshewar rup se jaanch se sabit karegi ki hatya kaise hui or doshi koun tha
 Politicians will do politics, they do not see the school hospital for politics, but how is the police doing its work
 paresh maista kii maut kis vajah se hui he police kii taraf se abhi saaf nahin he
 His body was found in a pond in Hannover after 2 days
 bijepi ke netaa kehete hai ki paresh maista unka kaaryakarta tha or uski maut ke peeche kisi muslim sanghathan kaa haath
 Paresh Maesta's father says that his son was not associated with any organization
 paresh ke pita kamalaakar ne kannada main kaha he ki hamaara kisi party yaa sanghathan se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 It is true that we are Hindus but Paresh was not associated with any organization
 bijepi kii saansad ne paresh ko aresas or bijepi kaa kaaryakarta bataaya tha
 BJP MP says that police is pressing the case
 paresh ko koi dalit bataata he to koi kuch
 The fact is that Paresh died
 saamaajik kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki paresh na to dalit he na obisi
 Our colleague Nihal Kidwai has filed two reports on this incident

 Apart from Telegraph, The Wire Hindi, Wire English, Prabhat Khabar, this news has appeared in many newspapers
 police adhikari eke trivedi ne jaanch shuru ho chuki he to kaarnon ko lekar police ke bayaan kaa intazaar kiya ja saktaa he
 In The Wire, Javed Iqbal has written that two different massacres take place in Bhagalpur within a week
 donon ko lekar raajnneetik pratikriya main antar bihar main jati kii raajnneeti ke bare main bahut kuch kahata he
 There is not even a nominal reporting of the incident of a Dalit family being cut off in the mainstream media outside Bihar
 padosi ke liye bhi asambhav rahaa hoga ki unhen hamale kii jaankaree na hui ho, phir bhi koi kuch baat nahin kar rahaa he

 Javed Iqbal has written when Gayatri Ram's elder son Santosh told that he grabbed his feet, folded his hands, asked all the neighbors, nobody said anything
 main do dinon se kuch khaaya nahin hum
 Everyone asked what happened but nobody said anything
 kanik ram jis basti main rahete hai vahaan 70 dalit ghar hai, magar us samaaj se bhi koi himmat nahin juta paa rahaa he ki aakar gavaahi de yaa kuch kahe
 Are people of other societies also unable to muster courage? kya jati ke saath sab khadey rahanaa chaahate hai yaa phir unhen police par bharosa nahin he
 Kanik Ram has three sons and a daughter
 do bete batch gaye hai
 a son labors outside and slept on the pond the night of an incident
 kya hatyaron ko apane saamaajik, raajnneetik yaa dharmik aadhaar par itnaa bharosa hota he ki ve system ko manage kar lenge
 Once the investigation is postponed for five years to ten years, then everything is managed
 is ghar main rahane vaala kanik ram urf gayatri ne aakhir kiskaa kya bigaad liya hoga
 20,000 were found under Indira Awas Yojana, half the unfinished house is built

 They must have been dying from their own poverty, why did those who killed them commit such cruelty? hatya ke paanch dinon baat tak farsh par koon bikharaa rahaa
 a blood-stained pillow remained scattered in the corner
 chuulhe par khaanaa pakaa bhi nahin tha, pak rahaa tha jab hatyaron ne hamalaa kiya
 Different arguments are being given
 machhlee mafia kaa kaam bataaya jaataa he
 Kanik Ram Talab used to work on contract
 haal hi main usne kai logon ke saath milakar kisaanon se ek talab yani jalakar kharida tha
 Some say that molestation or love affair is also the reason
 magar dhyaan bhatakaane yaa kisi or masale main lapet dene kii koshish ho rahi he
 Some are giving communal color and some are casteist
 isi tarah ke anek baaten karte karte sara maamla hi gol ho jaataa he
 Dalits have so much power that political parties consider them as vote banks, otherwise no one goes to meet them

 On one hand, three people are brutally murdered in a Dalit colony, but none of the 70 houses in their locality are able to speak, the upper castes of the village do not come in favor of that Dalit, but a Dalit was killed in Tamil Nadu So in protest, only the daughter of the parents who murdered her stood up
 kaushalya ne apane mata pita ko maaf nahin kiya
 Our colleague Uma Sudhir has reported the matter
 es kaushalya ne ve shankar se pyaar kiya or shaadi kii
 Kaushalya is also an engineer and 23-year-old v Shankar was also an engineer
 july 2015 main donon ne apni pasand se shaadi kar lee
 v Shankar was a Dalit
 shaadi ke aath maheene baad kaushalya ke pita ne bhaade ke gundon se ve shankar ko marava diya
 Kaushalya's parents are money earners, politically powerful Thevars, they strongly oppose marriage to a Dalit boy
 tripur kii is ghatana par desh bhar main charchaa hui thi
 Kaushalya left her parents' house after the incident
 coimbatore main pati ke maa baap ke saath hi rahane lagi
 Kaushalya was given a government job after the incident
 police suraksha bhi di gai
 Had there not been CCTV footage of the incident, the murderers might have been released
 pichley saal march main kaushalya or shankar tirupur ke ek market main gaye the
 The assassins attacked Shankar and Kaushalya
 shankar ko tab tak maaraa jab tak mar nahin gaya
 Kaushalya was also badly injured
 use kai hafte lag gaye thik hone main
 After recovering, she broke down so much that she tried to commit suicide
 batch gai magar uske baad ladane kaa jo iraadaa kiya vah apane aap main ek misaal he
 Kaushalya will have to give herpes ek saal se kuch zyada vakt to laga magar faisla aa gaya
 Tirupur district court sentenced six people to life imprisonment in this case
 teen log bari hue hai jinamein kaushalya kii maa bhi he magar kaushalya apni maa ke khilaaf apil karne vaali he
 Everyone should be told about this adventure of Kaushalya
 shankar kii maut hamaare samaaj kaa cheharaa he to kaushalya kaa apane pita ko aaajeevan jail bhijwa dena bhi ek misaal he
 Kaushalya has said that December 12 is a historic day in honor killing cases
 jati kii hinsa ke khilaaf na ham sakht ho sake na dharm kii hinsa ke khilaaf
 But nobody misses politics about violence
 karnataka main ek aisi hi ghatana saamne ai he
 Politics is taking place in Hanover, North Karnataka over the death of Paresh Maista, a young man
 raajnneeti alag he lekin kya police peshewar rup se jaanch se sabit karegi ki hatya kaise hui or doshi koun tha
 Politicians will do politics, they do not see the school hospital for politics, but how is the police doing its work
 paresh maista kii maut kis vajah se hui he police kii taraf se abhi saaf nahin he
 His body was found in a pond in Hannover after 2 days
 bijepi ke netaa kehete hai ki paresh maista unka kaaryakarta tha or uski maut ke peeche kisi muslim sanghathan kaa haath
 Paresh Maesta's father says that his son was not associated with any organization
 paresh ke pita kamalaakar ne kannada main kaha he ki hamaara kisi party yaa sanghathan se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 It is true that we are Hindus but Paresh was not associated with any organization
 bijepi kii saansad ne paresh ko aresas or bijepi kaa kaaryakarta bataaya tha
 BJP MP says that police is pressing the case
 paresh ko koi dalit bataata he to koi kuch
 The fact is that Paresh died
 saamaajik kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki paresh na to dalit he na obisi
 Our colleague Nihal Kidwai has filed two reports on this incident
 congress sarkaar ke grahamantri bijepi par aarope lagaate hai ou bijepi ke netaa congress sarkaar par
 Accusations will continue but on the basis of investigation, it will take years to reach the end

 paresh kaa shav milte hi soshal media par afvaahon kaa daur shuru ho gaya
 a second picture was put on his photo that it was said that chemicals had been put on his mouth and religious tattoos made on his body had been erased to provoke emotions
 police kaa kahana he yah sab galat he
 Paresh has no chemical marks on his face

 Nihal has quoted an NGO as saying that there have been 300 small and big religious quarrels here
 bihar ke baahar mukhyadhara kii media main ek dalit parivaar ko kaat die jane kii ghatana kii naam maatr bhi reporting nahin hoti he
 It would have been impossible for the neighbor even if they did not know about the attack, yet no one is talking

 i have not eaten anything for two days
 sabase poocha ki kya hua magar kisi ne kuch nahin kaha
 There are 70 Dalit houses in the township where Kanik Ram lives, but no one is able to gather courage from that society to come and give testimony or say anything
 kya duusare samaaj ke log bhi himmat nahin juta paa rahe hai
 Do all want to stand with caste or do they not trust the police
 kanik ram ke teen bete hai or ek beti
 Two sons are survived
 ek betaa baahar mazaduri karata he or ek ghatana kii raat talab par soya tha
 Do the killers have such confidence in their social, political or religious grounds that they will manage the system
 ek baar jaanch paanch saal das saal tak talati chali jaae phir to sab manage ho hi jaataa he
 Who would have spoiled Kanik Ram alias Gayatri who lived in this house? indira awaas yojana ke tahat 20,000 mili the, aadha adhuraa ghar bana he
 There is no window, no door

 What should the poor farmer do? sinchai ke liye bhagwaan par or jab bhagwaan dhokhaa de de to muaavje ke liye sarkaar par hi nirbhar hai
 In fact, in the election campaign, BJP gave so much hope to the people that people thought that everything will be alright now

 ) dilli sarkaar ne NGT ke odd-even ko lekar 11 november ke aadesh ko modify karne ke liye yachika lagaai he
 The Delhi government has said in its petition that this time in odd-even women and two wheelers should be exempted
 sarkaar kaa tark he ki kyonki tu whilers ko bhi odd-even ke daayre main laayaa gaya to 30 se 35 lakh logon ko transport kii suvidha dene ke liye kareeb 3500 hajaar bason kii atirikt jarurat hogi, jo philhal dilli sarkaar ke paas nahin he
 The safety of women also cannot be put on hold right now
 lihaaja unako bheelodd-evenmem philhal shaamil na kiya jaae
 The Delhi government has said that pollution will continue to increase for the last 3 months and new buses will be arranged in the next 6 months
 yani agle saal nanvabar mendoodd-evenmem tu whilers ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 The NGT has approved the Delhi government's plea for hearing and ordered a hearing on Tuesday
 dilli sarkaar ko court se koi raahat milegi yaa nahin ye NGT main hone vaali sunwaayee ke baad hi saaf hoga
 But it is certain that if the NGT refuses to modify its order on November 11 regarding women and two-wheelers, then the implementation of odd-even this year for the Delhi government may prove to be a crook
 sarkaar jaanati he ki dilli kii sadakon par kareeb 60 lakh tu whealer hai
 Even if this number was halved during odd-even, the government would need an additional three and a half thousand buses to provide transportation to about 35 lakh people, which is currently beyond the capacity of the government to complete
 aise mendoodd-evenko lagu karne ke liye ek baar phir dilli sarkaar NGT kii sharan main he
 Tomorrow's hearing will be very important, because if it goes in favor of the government, then odd-even will apply in Delhi and if the court refuses for modification then the government will not be able to implement it
 lekin philhal pradooshan ke badhate str ko dekhte hue lagata he, bina barish ke dilli main pradooshan kam hone ke asaar naa ke baraabar hai
 In such a situation, both the government and the common people are awaiting the hearing in the NGT court on Tuesday
 jahanabad jile ke sikariya gaanv ke shivabhajan singh ke paas ek bigha se bhi kam jameen thi
 The house was dilapidated, yet he preferred weapons, he sold his wife's jewelry and bought a rifle
 aisa karne vaala vah bihar ke naksal prabhavit gaanv kaa akwla shaks nahin tha
 Two and a half dozen villagers bought rifles and guns despite weak economic status
 graminon ke saamne aisi sthiti mazdooree ke vivaad ko lekar mazdooron or kisaanon ke bich shuru hue khooni sangharsh se paidaa hui thim
 But the villagers' attachment to arms was shown as long as there was a sense of insecurity among the villagers
 21 janvari, 2006 ko sikariya main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne 'aapaki sarkaar, aapke dwaar' kaarykram kii shuruyaat kii tab se gaanv kii dasha-disha hi badal gai he
 After that the incidents of murder did not happen
 gaanv main sap javaanon ko tainaat kiya gaya tha lekin usase bhi mahatvapurn yah ki panchayat main samgr vikaas kii yojanaayen shuru kii gayi
 This increased the employment opportunities for the workers and opened up many income options for the farmers
 kadauna halt se sikariya tak chaudee sadakon kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 a modern market complex was constructed in the village in which Panchayat Bhawan, Additional Primary Health Center, Administrative Building, Grameen Bank, Kisan Bhavan, Vasudha Center, Rural Knowledge Center, Computer Training Center etc
 were constructed
 naaliyon or galiyon kaa vikaas kiya gaya
 Education was arranged in the village from primary to inter
 itnaa hi nahin, sikariya pehali panchayat he jisaki apni website banaai gai he
 Not only this, people living in the spirit of revenge have started showing interest in rural development works
 apano ke khone ke gam main uljhi mahilaayein 11 swayan sahaayta samoohon kaa gathan kar chuki hai
 Particularly that the bloody phase had started with the assassination of Rampravesh Singh and Dharmaraj Singh, but the sons of both of them have given a picture of the change of Sikaria by securing employment in the army
 jahanabad ke jiladhikari bala murgan di bataate hai, ''kheti, shiksha or rojgaar ke liye jaruratmand graminon ko aarthik madad bhi milegi
 When the Chief Minister reached Sikeria again on January 21, 2011, he was surprised at the change of the village
 is baar mukhyamantri ke saamne gramin pehali baar kii tarah suraksha kii chintaa nahin kar rahe the balki shikshakon kii gaiyr-maujuudagi, computer centre main vistaar or bijli main sudhaar kii ore dhyaan dilaa rahe the
 Actually, the story of the bloody struggle here started from the day when the labor leader of Agra, Uttar Pradesh, Dr
 Vinian came to Bihar to participate in JP movement
 ve 1978 ko sikariya pahunche or mazdooron ke paksh main khadey ho gaye
 The following year, Dr
 vinian or gaanv ke purv prakhand pramukh jangbahadur singh ne majdoor kisaan sangram samiti kaa gathan kiya
 In response, the farmers joined the Bhumi Army
 tab bhoomi sena ko parajeet karne ke liye samiti ne libration se haath mila liya
 Therefore, the fight for the supremacy of organizations in the name of farmers and laborers started, due to which more than 50 incidents of mass genocide took place in Central Bihar
 akavle sikariya gaanv main kramvaar tareeke se 34 logon kii hatya kar di gai
 Therefore, the villagers had no option but to use weapons
 baad main naksaliyon ne graminon ke saare hathiyaar bhi lut liye the
 Not only Sikaria, Sevanan, Mandevigaha, Jamuk, Bhawanichak, Suranpur panchayats of Jehanabad are being developed
 patna, gaya, jahanabad, rohtas, munger, pashchim champaran, purvi champaran or araval jile ke 65 panchayaton main sikariya model ko lagu karne ke prayaas ho rahe hai
 The government is trying to increase the capacities of the villagers with the development of Naxalite affected areas
 sarkaar dm or espi ke samanvay se kaam karne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 With this coordination, Sikaria has emerged as the ideal village of the country
 dm vikaas kaary chalaaen or espi yojanaon ke kriyanvayan ke liye padaadhikariyon ko suraksha pradaan karaaen
 However, the incident of killing six villagers and abducting eleven people through Naxalites in Kasali of Dharhara block of Munger is the latest episode in the '80s murder that started in Sikaria for minor reasons
 lihaaja, sikariya model kaa yaheen ant nahin hota
 Maintaining the survival of the villagers and bringing other Naxal-affected villages along the lines of Secaria is the biggest challenge for the government and administration

 Aaj Tak tried to know the mood of the country in view of the Lok Sabha elections 2019 in a survey conducted with Karvy Insights
 survey main kai sawaalon ke jawaab talashne kii koshish kii gai
 Many questions were asked in which the Modi government could bring good days to the people, who is in the Congress, who will contest Rahul as PM, Indira, Atal or Modi, who is India's most popular PM
 chunaavon main paise ke galat istemaal ko lekar aksar khabaren aati rahati hai
 There have been cases of use of money power in many ways including greed of voters
 isi mudde ko lekar jab hamaare survey main logon se poocha gaya ki kya modi sarkaar ko chunaavon main dhanabal ke prayog ko kam karne kadam uthaane chahie? to jawaab main logon kii alag-alag raay saamne ai
 In a survey conducted in August 2017, when people were asked whether the Modi government should take steps to reduce the use of money power in elections? So 50 percent people expressed their opinion yes
 vahiin, 29 fisadi logon ne jawaab na main diya
 21 percent people do not have any opinion in this matter
 iske baad janvari 18 main kiye gaye survey main usee sawaal ke jawaab main kuch zyada antar nahin dekha gaya
 This time too, 50 percent people agreed to the question
 lekin is 33 fisadi logon ne apana jawaab na main diya
 At the same time, 17 percent believed that they do not have any opinion about this
 isi sawaal ko lekar agast 18 main kiye survey main saamne aayaa ki 56 fisadi log siyaasi dalon ke chunaav main paise galat istemaal ko lekar sarkaar dwaara kadam uthaae jane ke paksh main hai
 However, 27 percent people were against it
 vahiin 17 fisadi logon ke jawaab ke mutabik ve maamle par koi raay nahin rakhte hai
 In January 2019, the latest survey revealed that 61 percent people want the government to take steps in the matter
 vahiin 23 fisadi log iske paksh main nahin the
 16 percent of the people do not have any opinion on mal
 is tarah survey ke adhar par kul milakar ye kaha ja saktaa he ki jyadatar log chaahate hai ki modi sarkaar ko chunaavon main dhanabal ke prayog ko kam karne siyaasi dalon kii funding par sudhaar ke liye kadam uthaane chahie
 Let me tell you that this is a survey of India today-karvy Insights in which 12,166 people were asked questions
 isamen 69 fisadi gramin or 31 fisadi shahari log shaamil the
 Its scope extended to 97 Lok Sabha constituencies and 194 assembly seats

 Surila and Sufiana from Pakistan to Hindustan, due to his own savory and carefree voice, today is the birthday of Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, who settles
 raahat fateh ali khan aaj 42 baras ke ho gaye hai
 On the birthday of this brilliant singer who cheated the listeners with his melodious voice, let's see some of his special songs: 1
 nainna thag lenge (film:omkara)2
 Bol na mild-mild (film: Jhoom Barabar Jhoom) 3
 tere mast mast do nain (film:dambang)4
 Dil To Bachcha Hai Ji (film: Ishqiya) 5
 jag suunaa-suunaa laage (film: om shanti om) Without color, the imagination of Holi becomes very monotonous
 lekin rang agar sharir par jam jaaen to chhudaana behad mushkil hota he
 No one would want to go to work on another day with a black painted face
 aaie jaanate hai holi ke ziddee rang ko kaise ghar par aap aasaani se chhudaa sakate hai
 1
 khire kaa prayog bhi rang chhudaane ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Remove the cucumber juice, mix a little rose water and a teaspoon of vinegar and prepare a paste, wash your mouth with it
 chehre ke rang bhi chhot jaaenge or twachaa main nikhaar bhi aa jayega
 2
 rang chhudaane ke maamle main muuli kaa bhi koi jawaab nahin he
 Make a paste by mixing radish juice with milk and gram flour or maida and applying it on the face also clears the face
 cheharaa hi nahin sharir ke kisi bhi ang par lage rang ko chhudaana ho to bhi is paste kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Chemical colors are harmful, make herbal color 3 on Holi
 neembu or besan kaa prayog karke bhi aasaani se rang chhudaaya ja saktaa he
 To get rid of color, mix lemon and milk in gram flour and make a paste and apply it on your skin
 pandrah-bees minute tak paste laga rahane den or phir gunagune pani se munh-haath dho len
 4
 twachaa par lage gahare rang ko chhudaane ke liye do chammach zinc oxide or do chammach castor oil milakar lep banaaen or ise chehre par lagaaein
 After this, wash face after rubbing with light hands
 bees-pachchis minute baad sabun lagaakar cheharaa dhoen
 The color applied to your skin will disappear
 dhyaan rahe ki lep chehre par lagane ke dauraan bahut ragaden nahin or behatar parinaam ke liye spanj kaa prayog karen
 Your Holi 5 will be incomplete without these 5 things

 This unique wedding took place last week where there was no sparkle or frills of any kind, but with simplicity, the couple tied the knot
 jab dhare ke dhare rah gaye dhoomdhaam se shaadi ke sapaneyogendra saahani ne apni beti saraswati kii shaadi apane hi gaanv ke rahane vaale munshi saahani ke bete rajakumar se tay kii thi
 Like every father, Yogendra Sawhney had also decided to celebrate his daughter's wedding with great pomp, but suddenly all his dreams were lost due to demonetisation
 note bandi kii vajah se hataash yogendra saahani kii pareshaani kaa pataa jab ladke ke pita munshi saahani ko chalaa to unhone ek adarsh misaal kaayam karte hue yogendra saahani ko salaah di ki vah shaadi par koi kharch na karen or aisa karne par unhen yaa unke bete ko koi pareshaani nahin hogi
 Neither any dishes nor transactions, the Laddus received by the Baratis and according to the Chaitay date, Rajkumar Sahni reached the Saraswati's house with a procession and the two married without any bravado or frills
 khaas baat ye he ki is shaadi main na hi tarah-tarah ke vyanjan parose gaye the, na hi dahej kaa len-dein hua balki baratiyo ko sirf ek-ek cap chaay or laddu khilaayaa gaya jis par kul milakar kharch 1100 rupye aayaa
 Pandit did not get married at the wedding, said Minister Saraswati, 'our marriage was already decided but on the occasion of demonetisation, father was having a lot of problems
 ham shaadi ko taal nahin sakate the or isliye baaraatiyon ko sirf ek cap chaay or ek laddu khilaayaa gaya
 'it is worth mentioning that the marriage of Rajkumar and Saraswati was not done by any Pandit, but both of them considered themselves Agni as a witness and married each other

 This judgment of the Supreme Court of 493 pages on section 377 was delivered by a five-judge bench on 6 September
 is faisle kii bhashaa or muhaavarey behad damdaar hai
 All the judges agreed, yet they wrote four separate judgments and each emphasized the need to completely remove homosexuality from the purview of criminality
 justise chandrachud—jinaki bhashaa sabase adhik naatakeey thi—ne likhaah "aisa vakt jarur aana chahie jab samanta or samavesh kii sanvaidhanik guarantee dashakon se prachlit bhedbhaav ko samaapt kar degi
 
 
 That time has come now
 ''yahi sahi he
 Most of the media headlines were applauding this decision of the Supreme Court and describing it as taking the country into the 21st century
 faisle main saaf kaha gaya he ki "algebiti samudaay ko asweekaar kaa apmaan jhelane ke liye ek sau atthavan varsh ek lanbaa samay he
 Even after the constitution came into force it took 68 years for it, it reminds us that much more is yet to be done
 '' beshak, yahi sachaai he
 The court has cited many literary and philosophical figures in a bold attempt to take the country into the 21st century by ensuring equal rights to all citizens without any discrimination regarding sexual interest
 faisle main shakespeare se lekar goethe, arestu, kaant or rolls tak un tamaam vichaarkon ko uddhrut kiya gaya he jinhone sankeern sampradayik bhedbhaav se upar uthakar sanvaidhanik naitikta ke mahatv par nyaayadhishon ke vichaaron ko prabhavit kiya he
 What is valid for heterosexuals should also be legally valid for homosexuals and bisexuals
 or yah sanvaidhanik naitikta bharat main anekta ko sweekaar karne kaa prayaas he
 Justice Chandrachud writes: "our Constitution," above all, accepts "diversity"
 isaki neenv aise samaveshi samaaj ke nirmaan kii drushti par rakhi gai he jo jivan ke anek taur-tareekon ko sthaan detaa he
 "but if we think closely about the thinkers mentioned above, two things become clear which probably goes against this admirable commitment to diversity
 pehla, faisle main jin darshanikon, kalakaaron or lekhakon ko uddhrut kiya gaya he, unamem lagbhag sabhi purush hai
 Secondly, there is no Indian among them
 (kuchhek mahilaon or kuch bhartiya mahilaon ke bhi uddhran hai lekin unki taadaad thodi he or unhen bamushkil hi sidhe uddhrut kiya gaya he
 ) But why should we consider this inequality? i would say that we should look into it for the following reasons: Despite being historical, fantastical and bold, the Supreme Court verdict mainly imprisons itself in Western ideas that seem to be a copycat, not a colonial mindset
 Gonna break isamen koi shaq nahin he ki is romaanchakaari faisle ne vividhta ke siddhant kaa anukaran kiya he, lekin yah bhi sach he ki anekta kii isaki chaah vilakshantaa ke saaye kii bedicaon main jakadi hui he
 We think a little more about this
 faisle ko saahitiyik, darshanik or aitihaasik vajan dene ke liye mil, wild or shakespeare ko ullekh karne main kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Its classical effect is meant to indicate that many great thinkers of the world have held the same opinion
 lekin inamen se lagbhag sabhi vichaarak ek hi parampara se jude rahe hon to vah vividhta ke vichaar ke khilaaf jaataa he
 If we follow the path of "judo-christian tradition" —as judged — then this story looks something like this
 vaivaahik vishamalangikta se itar koi bhi sambandh sandigdh he or uske liye hinsa kaa vidhaan he
 The Book of Leviticus from the Old Testament of the Bible, dating back over 2000 years, provides all the ways of misery for men who have relationships with men
 is tarah kii parampara main samalangikta ko hameshaa se lajja ke badalon se dhakaa gaya he or sadiyon se hinsa kii jaati rahi he
 About 200 years ago, the British brought this tradition to India
 yahi vah parampara he jo 1860 main lord maikale ke indian penal code kii ghoshnaa ke liye jimmedaar he or jisamen dhara 377 bhi shaamil he
 That is why the five-member bench of the Supreme Court emphasizes bigotry arising out of the judo-christian tradition, as the British came to India with this tradition
 phir vidwaan nyaayadhishon ne aazaadee kii daleel ko majbootee dene main mukhya rup se usee purvagrahpurn parampara kii taraf kyon dekha? aap kah sakate hai ki judo-chrishchiyan parampara haalanki aitihaasik rup se samalangikta ke khilaaf rahi he lekin pichley kuch dashakon main vibhinn prakaar kii youniktaa ko sweekaar karne main usne kai bade kadam uthaae hai
 And this is the reason why the Supreme Court has resorted to the same
 lekin ham agar ise thodaa duusare tareeke se dekhen to kya najar aayega?jis samay bible uski ghor ninda kar rahaa tha, jise baad main vah "pyaar kaha jane laga jise jubaan par laane kii himmat na hoyya, lagbhag usee samay bhartiya sabhyataaon ke dharmon or shastron main yah ek sahaj ichha maan lee gai thi
 In the Kamasutra of Vatsyayan in the third century, there is a clear mention of people of the "third nature", while in other parts of the world it has already been referred to as aberration

 Amir Khusro was writing poems for his Pir Nizamuddin Auliya in the 13th century, seven centuries before the British ended the system of chemically castration for homosexual punishment
 16veen sadi main chaitanya mahaprabhu ne khud ko krishna ke prati samarpit radha ke rup main varnit kiya tha
 Shortly before the time Oscar Wilde was sentenced, Nawab Naseeruddin Haider of Awadh took the form of women on the birthday of every Imam in the 19th century
 to, phir pichley hakrate ke swaagatyogy faisle ke bare main ham yah bhi kah sakate hai ki vah hamen 21veen sadi ke badale teesri yaa 18veen sadi main le jaataa he
 Here this decision itself states that it can be done
 supreme court ne australia ke purv jaj maaikel kirabi ko uddhrut kiya he jo emsam ko aise purush bataate hai jo "purushon ke saath sex karte hai
 It is common in UN circles
 yah purushon kaa purushon ke saath bhautik, yonik gatividhi ko bataata he
 This expression is used on the basis that in some countries, including India, some men may engage in sex with other men
 haalanki ve khud ko samalangik nahin maanate hai, yaa romantic sambandh kii baat sweekaar nahin karte hai
 
 
 "in other words, India seems to be known as a civilization in which the attraction of men to men has historically been so widespread that many people had not historically thought it to be an objectionable identity
" yani ham pichley 200 varshon se jo ladaai ladate aa rahe the, vah hamaare itihaas kaa ek adhyay rahaa he
 And when the verdict states that "a person's choice to engage in certain actions in private has been restricted by criminalization based on an age-old belief", it can be asked, on whose assumption? Why should we not look at the fact that our country has a rich history of diverse sexual interests over the centuries and crime than any part of the world? Area was not considered
 is nazariye se hamaari ichha kaa paridrishy kahin zyada vaibhavshaalee he or anekta se paripurna he

 kaledhan par bolte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha ki kalaadhan desh ke saamne ek badi chunauti he or kendra sarkaar usapar lagaam lagane kaa koi mauka nahin chhodeygi
 However, people in the country hoped that Prime Minister Modi would announce any major achievement on black money from this platform

 Prime Minister Modi said that he had inherited a government which was badly caught in the clutches of corruption
 unki sarkaar ne dilli main maahaul ko badalane kaa kaam kiya he
 It is the achievement of his government that now power brokers are not seen in the corridors of power in Delhi

 By purchasing it at this rate, the government delivers it to the public for 2 rupees
 vahiin bazaar main chaaval 30-32 rupee main he or sarkaar is dar par kharid kar 3 rupee main rashan card ke jariye janata tak pahunchaa rahi he

 vahiin aam aadmi ko vahi genhu or chaaval kharidne ke liye bazaar kii keemat adaa kerani padati thi

 Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Friday said that the right implementation of development programs is the answer to Naxalism, which is creating challenges before the public order and administration in many areas, especially in tribal areas

 So far, fate has not even supported Dhoni against England
 apni captaini main team ko 2007 tii20 vishwa cap jitaane ke baad se hi dhoni ko ‘captain kool’ kii upama mili thi lekin pichley kuch saal main test maichon main kharaab nateezon ke baad unki lokapriyata kam hui he
 Indian batting weaknesses have also been exposed after the retirement of two middle-order batsmen like Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman from two consecutive defeats in the current home series at the hands of England
 sachin tendulkar kii kharaab farm se bhi bharat kii mushkilen badi hai jabaki anya anbhavi ballebaaj bhi ummid ke mutabik pradarshan karne main naakaam rahe hai
 In such a situation, Dhoni publicly demanded to make such wickets which are suitable for spin from day one, but his demand was also reversed because England's preparation was better
 mumbai or kolkata main shikast ke baad bharat ke paas shrinkhalaa ko dra karaane ke liye nagpur main chauthe or antim test main jeet darj karne ke alaava koi chaara nahin bachaa he
 However, Dhoni's record as captain has not been good in the last two years

 Five of these seven wins were recorded by India on home soil, which shows the current form of the team

 Dhoni scored 18 in the current series
 40 kii ausat se ran banaae hai or unka sarvshereshth score 52 rahaa
 Dhoni made 29 from the beginning of 2011 until the Kolkata Test against England
 28 kii ausat se 849 ran banaaye hai
 It consists of a century and 7 half-centuries
 is lihaaj se team main unka wicketiper ke rup main jagah surakshit dikhataa he lekin bataur captain unka pradarshan niraashajanak hi rahaa he
 In such a situation, the question arises that if Team India faced defeat in Nagpur Test also, will the selectors afford to retain them as captain for the next series

 If technological improvements can reduce the side effects of diesel, but if technology were to happen, then why is it banned in many cities of the world

 british kaal par likhi gai is kitaab ke likhe jane kaa bhi ek kissa he, jiskaa zikr shashi tharur kii aadhikarik website par kiya gaya he
 According to the website, 'in May 2015, when Shashi Tharoor was called to speak on' Britain Owes Reparations to Her Former Colonies' in Oxford Union, he gave a speech that was discussed worldwide
 july 2015 main is dibet ke video ko soshal site par twit kiya gaya, jo ki kuch hi ghanton main whatsap, twitor, fasebuk par viral ho gaya
 It is written that in a program attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Lok Sabha speaker also praised his speech
 jab is bhaashan kii charchaa chaaro ore hui to shashi tharur ke dost david davidar ne unhen salaah di ki is bhaashan ko vistaar se ek kitaab main utaarne kii jarurat he
 How different is the book of Tharoor from the speech? This book is written on the website of Shashi Tharoor, 'this book is not entirely based on the speech given in Britain
 kyonki wo bhaashan puri tarah se ekatarfa tha, lekin is kitaab main kyonki baat vistaar se ho rahi he isliye donon taraf ke pakshon ko rakhaa gaya he
 The book also talks about the expansion of the British period, as well as the British Raj in India, which also explained the benefits of the British Raj
 british raaj khatm hone ke baad kis tarah bharat aage badha, uske bare main kuch chapter main zikr kiya gaya he

 rashtriya janata dal (argedy) adhyaksh lalu prasad ne notebandi se janata ko ho rahi pareshaaniyon kaa zikr karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi se kai prashnon ke jawaab maange hai
 He has asked the Prime Minister if he will diagnose the problems of the public in 35 days? Otherwise, how many days will it torture the public? purv kendriya mantri ne patna main guuruuvaar ko ek press bayaan jari kar pradhanmantri se lagaataar ek darjan sawaal kiye hai tathaa kaha he ki janata ko aapke javaabon kaa intjaar rahegaa
 Lalu has asked the Prime Minister that you are the chief servant of the world's largest democracy (as you are beating everywhere)
 aapane ek pradhan sevak rahete hue janata ke bare main bina soche kaise itnaa bada kadam uthaa liya or kaise ye tughluqi farmaan janata par thope diya? He said, 'we are also strongly opposed to black money, but in the name of it, you cannot disturb the common people by sitting in the lap of the capitalists
 jinke paas sachmuch kaala dhan he, unako dabochne main pradhanmantri kyon hichkicha, sakuchaa rahe hai?' Lalu said that a fortnight ago, a sudden decree was given to the countrymen that after four hours, 86 percent of the country's currency would remain just a piece of paper
 yah tughluqi farmaan tha, kahawat ke rup main bhi, bhavatmak rup main bhi or vaastavik rup main bhi
 He said that a person whose decision depends on the lives of crores of people, does he have the right to take a decision without any hesitation, in spite of the charge, to swoon over the front pages? purv kendriya mantri ne pradhanmantri se poocha he, 'aaj desh kaa kisaan trahimam kar rahaa he
 Both his crops are on the verge of ruin
 kisaanon ne tumhaara kya bigaada tha? kisaanon se kis baat kaa badla liya ja rahaa he?' unhone kaha ki desh kaa kisaan nirdhan sahi, kintu nirbal nahin he
 The farmer of the country will not forgive Modi
 iske aage modi se sawalia lahaze main lalu kehete hai ki desh ke bhukhe, nirdhan, vanchit ko sataane main pradhanmantri ko koun sa naiysargik sukh praapt ho rahaa he? notebandi se jo hangaamaa khadaa kiya gaya he, uske shor sharabe main karodon logon ke bhukh or pidaa se karaahne kii aawaaj dab rahi he, par samaj lo hameshaa nahin dabegi
 Lalu said, 'PM tell me how many billion dollars of FDI has gone outside the country after demonetisation? With this step, how many progressive years will be sacrificed to recover from the negative message which has been spread all over the world in the image of chaos in the Indian economy? rajd netaa ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ko bataanaa chahie ki rupee kii kamajori or badtar halaat kaa jimmevaar koun he? is kadam se sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) dar jo gote khaaegi, uski bharpai main kitne varsh lagenge? vikaas dar main giravat kii jimmevary pradhanmantri legaa yaa bali kaa bakra dhundha jayega? Lalu said in a press statement that so far more than 75 people have died due to demonetisation
 inaki hatya kaa doshi koun he? pradhanmantri bataaen ki peedit pariwaron ko muaavja diya jayega ki nahin? pradhanmantri ko bataanaa chahie ki chote vyapaariyon ko hue nuksaan kii bharpai koun karegaa? asangathit kshetra ke logon ko hui asuvidha or nuksaan kaa harjaana koun bharegaa? Lalu questioned PM Modi, 'was the Council of Ministers' consent in the Prime Minister's decision on demonetisation? If it was true, then who were the people who participated in this decision
 janata jaananaa chaahati he ki uski is durdasha ke liye koun-koun jimmedaar hai?'tippaniyan Taking a dig at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), he questioned the Prime Minister, "is this the case, is this demonetisation done on the orders of the Sangh?" Why is Mohan Bhagwat silent? Modi should set a limit as to when he will get Rs 15 lakh deposited in his account? (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the syndicate feed
 ) The former Union Minister has issued a press statement in Patna on Thursday, asking a dozen questions from the Prime Minister continuously and said that the public will be waiting for your answers
 lalu ne pradhanmantri se poocha he ki aap vishwa ke sabase bade loktantr ke pradhan sevak hai (jaisaa ki aap har jagah dhindhora peetate hai)
 As a chief servant, how did you take such a big step without thinking about the public and how this Tughlaki decree was imposed on the public? unhone kaha, 'humlog bhi kaale dhan ke sakht virdohi hai, parantu iske naam par aap puunjipatiyon kii god main baithkar aam logon ko pareshaan nahin kar sakate
 Why is the Prime Minister hesitating to catch those who really have black money? ' lalu ne kaha ki ek pakhwaare purv achaanak deshavaasiyon ko yah farmaan sunaaya gaya ki chaar ghante baad desh kii 86 pratishat mudra sirf kaagaj kaa tukdaa rah jaaegi
 This was the Tughlaqi decree, in the form of proverbs, also in emotional and in real terms
 unhone kaha ki jis vyakti ke ek nirnay par karodon logon kaa jivan tikaa ho, kya use bina kuch dekhe, aavesh main aakar, mukhyaprishthon par chaane ke liye anaap-shanaap nirnay lene kaa adhikaar he? The former Union Minister has asked the Prime Minister, 'today the farmer of the country is doing Trihimam
 uski donon fasalein barbaad hone ke kagaar par he
 What did the farmers do to you? What is being avenged from the farmers? ' He said that the country's farmer is poor, but not weak
 desh kaa kisaan modi ko maaf nahin karegaa
 Further, in the tone of question to Modi, Lalu says that what natural pleasure the Prime Minister is getting in tormenting the hungry, poor and deprived of the country? The noise of the commotion that has been created by demonetisation, the noise of crores of hunger and suffering of crores of people is being suppressed, but understand it will not always be buried
 lalu ne kaha, 'pradhanmantri bataaen ki notebandi ke baad epadiai kaa kitna billian dollar desh ke baahar ja chukaa he? is kadam se bhartiya arthvyavastha main avyavashtha kii chhavi vaala jo nakaaratmak sandesh puure vishwa main gaya he, usase ubar paane main kitne pragatisheel saalon kii bali chadhegi?' The RJD leader said that the Prime Minister should tell who is responsible for the rupee's weakness and the worse situation? With this step, how many years will it take to compensate for the dives that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will eat? Will the Prime Minister take responsibility for the fall in growth rate or will the scapegoat be found? lalu ne press bayaan main kaha he ki notebandi ke kaaran abtak 75 se adhik log mar chuke hai
 Who is guilty of his murder? Tell the Prime Minister whether the families of the victims will be compensated or not? The Prime Minister should tell who will compensate the losses suffered by small traders? Who will pay the damages for inconvenience and loss to the people of the unorganized sector? lalu ne piem modi se prashn kiya, 'pradhanmantri ke notebandi ke nirnay main kya mantriparishad kii sahmati thi? agar sachmuch thi, to is nirnay main koun koun log bhagidaar the
 The public wants to know who is responsible for this plight? unhone rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) par bhi nishaanaa sadhate hue pradhanmantri se sawaal kiya ki kahin aisa to nahin, sangh ke aadesh par hi yah notebandi kaa swang rachaa gaya? mohan bhagwat chup kyon hai? modi seemaa nirdhaarit karke bataaen ki unke vaadanusaar logon ke khate main 15-15 lakh rupee kab jamaa honge?(hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) lalu ne pradhanmantri se poocha he ki aap vishwa ke sabase bade loktantr ke pradhan sevak hai (jaisaa ki aap har jagah dhindhora peetate hai)
