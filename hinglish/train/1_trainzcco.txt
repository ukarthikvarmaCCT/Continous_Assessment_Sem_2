 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj responded sequentially to all the opposition's questions and allegations
 magar congress netaa unke jawaab se santusht nahin dikhe
 After which he has said to bring a motion for breach of privilege against Sushma Swaraj
 congress ke rajyasabha sadsy anand sharma ne kaha ki sadan main sushamaa swaraj ne jhooth bolaa he
 He said that Sushma should apologize for her statement, otherwise she would face breach of privilege
 anand sharma ne kaha ki burhan vaani ke encounter se pehle pathankot atake hua, iske alaava 9 or aatanki hamale hue, jinhen sushamaa swaraj bhul gayi
 Congress MP Rajiv Shukla also commented on Sushma's statement
 unhone kaha ki mujhe lekar videsh mantri ne sadan main jo bayaan diya he wo puri tarah galat he
 Rajeev Shukla spoke of bringing a privilege notice against Sushma
 darasal, sushamaa swaraj ne sadan main kaha tha ki bandung asia africa sambandhon par hue sammelan main unhen bayaan dena kaa mauka hi nahin mila
 At the same time, Congress MP Anand Sharma kept saying that he gave a speech and did not take the name of former PM Pandit Nehru
 vahiin sushamaa swaraj ne pakistan se bharat ke sambandhon par sadan main bataaya tha ki 2016 main kashmir memburhan vanike encounter ke baad donon deshon ke rishton main bigaad aayaa
 While the Congress says that in 2015, when PM Modi went to Lahore to wish the then Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif a happy birthday, there was a terrorist attack in Pathankot shortly after
 vipaksh kaa ye bhi maananaa he ki pathankot ke alaava paanch or ghatnayen bhi huin
 Sushma Swaraj while commenting on Rajiv Shukla said, "your Rajiv Shukla is saying why not give CPEC, why did not go to OBOR
" hamaari samprabhutaa se judaa he, ham kaise sipiisi de den, ye to pioke se guzar rahaa he
 So is there so much democracy in Congress that Anand Sharma should talk something else and then even Rajiv Shukla can say something

 The government is misleading the public, the government says that the opposition is trying to mislead the people of the state by creating a dispute without reason
 jise sarkaar apane tareeke se jabaab degi
 At the same time, the government is also adopting tricks to help the opposition so that the budget session can be completed without any interference
 jabaki vipaksh ne bhi abtak in muddon par apane tevar deele nahin kiye hai
 Chief opposition party in the state, JMM, says that the opposition will not back down from doing its duty in the House
 sarkaar ke har us faisle kaa virodh kiya jayega jo adivasee or aam janata ke hiton ke khilaaf hoga
 While the Congress says that it is the responsibility of the government to run the house smoothly and it will have to communicate with the opposition

 All sorts of claims were being made at the Edgbaston ground in Birmingham before the match between India and Pakistan
 vaise bade mukaable main hameshaa se team india ne pakistan ko shikast di he
 But the cricket team was talking about a tough competition with the Pakistani team regarding this match of Champions Trophy
 vaise bhi bharat-pakistan ke bich cricket kaa muqabla donon deshon ke logon ke liye naak kaa sawaal ban jaataa he
 But if the performance of the Pakistani team in the Birmingham match is taken into consideration, then never showed the passion and passion in the team for which the team was known
 isse pehle bhale hi bharat ne maichon main pakistan ko shikast di ho, lekin paak kii team aakhri gend tak jeet ke liye maidan main sangharsh karti dikhti thi
 Joe Edgbaston did not appear in the ground
 pakistani khilaadiyon ko dekhakar aisa laga jaisaa unke kaanon main kisi ne kah diya ho ki jeet bharat kii hi hogi or phir unhone hathiyaar daal die
 Pakistan won the toss and elected to bowl first
 dhardaar gendbaaji ke liye mashhoor pakistan kii team jab maidan par utari to laga ki 28 maheene baad donon timen aamane-saamne hai to match romaanch se bharaa hoga
 But from the very beginning, the Pakistani players never showed the strength that was seen on the field of play against India
 edbeston kaa maidan ballebaajon ke liye makul tha
 But still the way the Indian batsmen were collecting runs, and the Pakistani bowlers were seen on the field
 usee se saaf ho gaya ki is match main pakistani khilaadiyon ne ghutane tech die hai
 Even if the wickets of the Indian batsmen have fallen, it cannot be seen to be linked with the success of Pakistani bowling, because the batsmen lost wickets by mistake
 chaahe wo shikhar dhawan kaa wicket ho yaa phir kohli, yuvaraj kaa out hona
 Never bowled in Pakistani bowling, nor did they show passion in fielding players
 ek daur tha jab pakistani player har gend par joardaar apil karte the, match kaa romaanch apane charam par hota tha
 And the fight continued to win until the last ball
 keval gendbaaji nahin, jis tarah se pakistani khilaadiyon ne aasaan kaich chode or phir kai baar aise ran bhartiya ballebaajon ko mili jo pakistan khilaadiyon ke manobal par sawaal khadey karte hai
 After that when the turn of the batting came, it was felt that the Pakistani players would try their best to chase the target
 lekin ajahar ali ko chhodkar koi ballebaaj krij par tik nahin paaya
 Didn't think he was batting to win against India

 unhone kaha ki 'bihar main bijepi ke chhutbhaiya netaaon ko jed plus suraksha mili hui he

 On the one hand, the ruling party and opposition parties were busy due to the political limelight in Maharashtra, while the Minister of State for Home Affairs in the Lok Sabha, g Kishan Reddy, introduced the SPG amendment bill amidst the noise
 special protection group act, 1988 main sanshodhan ke ahm badlaavon ke mutabik SPG suraksha kavach maujuuda pradhanmantri or unke saath aadhikarik awaas par rahane vaale kareebi rishtedaaron ko milegaa
 After the amendment of the Act, former Prime Ministers will get SPG protection only for five years
 purv pradhanmantri ke offis chhodane ke paanch saal baad tak unhen or unke aadhikarik awaas par saath rahane vaale parijanon ko SPG suraksha milegi
 Its technical meaning also means that if a former prime minister dies, his family will not get SPG cover
 is act ko pehle bhi 1991, 1994,1999 or 2003 main sanshodhit kiya ja chukaa he
 SPG cover was removed from the Gandhi family
 Let us know that after the recent security review, the central government had taken the step of removing the SPG cover of members of the Gandhi family i
e
 Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi, Priyanka's husband Robert Vadra
 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh se bhi SPG suraksha cover waapas le liya gaya
 Manmohan Singh has since received 'Z' security cover to the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF)
 isi tarz kii suraksha 8 november se gandhi parivaar ke sadasyon ko bhi mil rahi he
 Congress leaders strongly criticized the decision to withdraw the SPG Suraksha Kavach to the Gandhi family and termed it as an act of malice
 is ghatnakram kii vajah se bhi SPG (sanshodhan) bill ko ahm mana ja rahaa tha
 Sources associated with the government targeted the Gandhi family that the rules required for SPG cover were not being followed by them
 aise kai maukey aae jab unhone khud hi apni icchaanusaar espiji suraksha ko alag rakhaa
 SPG was formed in 1985
 31 oktober 1984 ko indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad pradhanmantri kii suraksha ke liye vishesh group ke gathan kii aavashyaktaa samajhi gai
 The SPG Act passed in 1988, the SPG Act passed in 1988
 ise pradhanmantri kii suraksha ke liye samarpit group banaaya gaya
 Initially, the former Prime Minister was not under its ambit in the Act
 baad main sanshodhan ke jariye purv pradhanmantriyon ko SPG suraksha ke daayre main laayaa gaya
 In 1989, VP Singh Sarkar withdrew the SPG cover from former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
 2003 main vaajapeyi sarkaar ne SPG act main phir sanshodhan kiya
 In this, the period of automatic protection from the day the former Prime Minister left office was reduced from 10 years to 1 year

 2008 se 2010 ke bich jo dikkatein raheen, unke baad aapaki sarkaar ne koun se badlaav kiye hai?hamane rajnatik or prashasnic pratikriya ke str par badlaav kiye
 We brought changes in the way security forces deal with situations
 sabase bada sabak yah rahaa ki ab ham kisi bhi cheez ko halake main nahin lete
 People also exercised great restraint? Yes, of course
 beeti do garmiyon main aman-chaiyn kaa sehara apane sir par baandh lenaa sarkaar ke liye aasaan hoga, lekin isamen janata kii bhi bhoomika he jo 2010 ke jaise halaat dobaaraa nahin chaahati
 i think we have been able to bring peace, and tourism has increased
 kya zyada sailaaniyon kaa matlab aapaki sarkaar ke liye zyada kamai he?sarkaar kii paryaton se kamai nahin hoti
 We do not have luxury tax here
 ham entry tex tak nahin lete
 The situation was so delicate that we wanted all the tourism earnings to reach the people directly
 akasar aapako ‘alag-thalag’ rahane vaala qaraar diya jaataa he?jab chijen gadabad chal rahi hon, to har kisi kii jabaan chalane lagati he

 vaise main jaisaa hum vaisaa hi hum, ab koi maane chaahe na maane
 The case of decentralization of rights has been implicated by the killing of sarpanches

 More sarpanches have been killed in Jharkhand
 meraa matlab yah nahin ki yahaan jo hua use nazarandaaj kar den, lekin ise itnaa tool dene kii kya jarurat he?aapane kashmir kii aadhi aabaadi yani yuvaaon ko puri duniya mutthi main kar lene kaa sapana dikhaaya tha?maine vaada kiya tha ki ham arthvyavastha ko durust karne kii koshish karenge
 It is a coincidence that my tenure is at a time when the Indian economy is also in its worst phase, but i think we have created an environment where the eyes of industrialists have shifted to Jammu and Kashmir
 kashmiri yuva aapse naaraaz hai ki aapane fasebuk, twitor or duusare soshal networkon par roak laga di?mere cellphone main beasenel kaa conection he or main is par fasebuk, twitor or you-tub sab dekhtaa hum
 No orders have been given to close them
 kya aap ab bhi sashastr bal visheshadhikaar kanoon (eexspie) ko waapas lene ke paksh main hai?beshak! jin ilaakon main maine eexspie hataane ko kaha he, vahaan fouj kii jarurat nahin he
 Where do you find Jammu and Kashmir at the end of your tenure? In terms of political solution, a lot depends on Delhi
 yah kahana sahi hoga ki vahaan jaise halaat hai, unhen dekhte hue yahaan kisi bhi thos siyaasi baatcheet ke asaar nahin dikhte
 We will be far ahead in terms of development today

 is niraash-hataash desh main bhi americanyon ke guantanamo bandi shivi jaisi cheez ho, yah kya koi bhi chahega? iskaa zikr bhar udaaravaadi laanton kaa tufaan khadaa kar saktaa he
 But even today, despite Barack Obama, this symbol of George Bush's moral temper remains
 bhartiya gitmo kaa vichaar maatr kisi dakshinpanthi yudhonmad kii fantasy ho sakati he yaa un logon ke krodh kii abhivyakti jo yah maanate hai ki bharat rajya-vyavastha ke shatruon-siddhant kii kitaaben uthaae swatantraaa senaniyon se lekar bandook lahraane vaale krantikariyon tak-kii sabase surakshit or sabase makul panaahagaah he
 By the way, in a country that has not needed a 9 / 11 scandal to realize the existence of murderers, the glorification of Gitmo does not seem very unnatural
 ham isse guzarate rahe hai
 If this life does not seem unbearable to India, then it is because of the national virtue of deprivation within us, that we have become so comfortable towards those people who would have used their freedom to fight against freedom
 Huh
 inhen us guantanamo kaa adarsh ummidavaar mana ja saktaa he jo hamaare yahaan nahin he
 All these are as free as Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who is anti-totem India
 tamaam vyaavhaarik-yaa ise ham bhavishya suchak bhi kah sakate hai?-kaarnon se yah bujurg shaks ghati kaa ayatollah ban gaya he, bhale hi uski safed dadhi iran ke mul ayatollah kii dadhi jitani lahardaar na ho
 His nationality may be Indian, which is a technical necessity, but it is a geographical curse and a history of calamity in the wider realm of his freedom struggle
 ve bharat shabd kaa uccharan is tarah karte hai jaise vah ek videshi shaitan ho jo bandhanon main bandhi unki aasthaa kaa dushman ho
 a cursory glance at his statements and interviews makes it clear how much he hates India, which he considers a powerful force, and to what extent can he agitate people against this oppressor

 As the guardian guru of the anti-india movement, he came to the valley with the intention of stone-pelting, martyrdom

 We call them rebels, separatists
 ham unhen aatankwaadi kyon nahin kah sakate? or unke saath vaisaa hi aacharan kyon nahin kar sakate? kya isliye ki kashmir kii janata ko shant karne kii apni koshishon, sarvadaleey baithkon kii apni jaddojahad ke maddenjar sarkaar ko unki jarurat he? yaa kya isliye ki unhone bharat-kabiz takat-ko saude par majaboor kar diya he or uski senaaon-jo is ganatantr kii un chand chizon main shumaar he jinka raajnneetikaran nahin hua he-ko is saude kaa ek mudda bana diya he? in sawaalon ke jawaab se is shaks ke bare main nayaa kuch saamne nahin aayega jisane bharat ke khilaaf jang kaa elaan kar diya he or jiske liye hathiyaar us swatantraaa se muhaiyaa hote hai jo unhen bharat kaa ek naagarik hone ke naate uplabdh he
 Like any other terrorist, he is a dimensional
 baharhaal, uparokt sawaalon ke jawaab bharat ke bare main beshak kaaphi kuch ujagar karte hai, jo raajnneetik auchity ke aatmghaatee dushchakra main ulajh hua he
 This is the reason why he cannot read the real text of Geelani's campaign

 And those gentlemen need only one concession - the coming of Kashmir from the colonial power
 zaadi
 Their demand is the right to self-determination
 itihaas hamen kuch or sanket detaa he-aise vivaadon kaa faisla vishistataavaadi ke haathon hota he
 One of the greatest achievements of Indian democracy is that it has an amazing ability to survive beyond history
 yahi vajah he ki ham asli mudde kii baar-baar andekhi kar jate hai, haalanki jis shaks ko kaayade se desh ke ‘talashshudaaon' kii suchi main shaamil hona chahie vah kuch nahin andekhi karata
 His provocation leads to uproar in the streets, figures of violence start to rise, there is complete synergy between freedom and jihad
 ve agenda tay karte hai or nai dilli uskaa sangyaan leti he
 If after 9 / 11, terrorism gains its strength through the exploitation of fear and denialism of faith, then Gilani can be considered the most enamored and effective terrorist today
 or sabase aashcharya kii baat to yah he ki jo unka shikaar he, vahi unke prati aasakt he
 Or it might not be so surprising if we look at how India's record has been in using terror in minimum national interest and maximum political exploitation
 gilaani ko jo aazaadee hasil he uski tulana tathakthith maovadiyon ko hasil visheshadhikaron se kii ja sakati he jinke khun-kharabe-khaskar janajaatiy ilaakon main-ne bharat ko rakshaatmak mudra apnaane ko majaboor kar diya he
 In his case, the same boring logic of development has turned the issue of national security into a hollow social slogan

 Like the God who is in the valley, the God of the forest needs to continue the fight against his enemy in the communal frenzy that arises out of the feeling of deprivation
 phir bhi, ham kuch aise congressi netaaon kaa horer sho dekhne ko abhishpt hai jinaki saamaajik antaratma band maansikta se grast he
 It can be lost if they lose the country, not lose the election
 ab ve aatankwaad kaa rang tay karne main jute hai taaki yah raajnneetik taur par dgayada mufeed ho
 It is certain that when the attacker is more politically important than the victim, then it does not matter whether the victim is a soldier or a common citizen, equal sharing of terror becomes a political necessity
 yahi vajah he ki ''bhagava'' aatankwaad achaanak aatankwaad kaa jawaab ban jaataa he
 This is such imminent terror, which we are afraid to mention religiously, because it does not hurt the sensation of those who keep beating the stereotype that there is no religion of terrorism
 beshak iskaa ek dharm he, or iskaa anumodan ham keval ghise hue video tepon main hi nahin dekhte hai
 We saw these approvals in different theatrical scenes in New York and London, in Bali and Madrid, in Mumbai and Jaipur, in Delhi and Ahmedabad
 ham inhen kashmir kii sadakon par bhayaavah tareeke se nirantar doharaaya jaataa dekhte rahete hai
 We do not have to justify or condone insurmountable forms of Hindutva, or isolated incidents like Malegaon, to see the global rise of radical Islamism and its intentions encroaching borders, and to see India as their old sufferer
 aatankwaad kaa adhyayan agar raajnneetik chashme se kiya jayega to vah gilaaniyon or maovadiyon ko or suraksha hi pradaan karegaa or bharat ko or kamjor hi karegaa
 There will be no unfortunate country like India suffering from terrorism, which is being weakened by the same people who are entrusted with the constitutional responsibility to protect it

 pkbole in opposition to the Citizenship Act - it should be clear that opposition to the citizenship law continues
 party line se hatakar janata dal united (jediu) ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor bhi virodh kar rahe hai
 Prashant Kishore said on Friday that there was a lot of debate in Parliament
 unhone kaha ki ab nyaaypalika se pare, bharat kii aatma ko bachaane kii jimmedaari gaiyr bhartiya janata party (bijepi) shasit 16 rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon par he, jo kanoon kaa kriyanvayan karenge
 pkane said that the three Chief Ministers (punjab / Kerala / West Bengal) have said no to the Citizenship Act and NRC
 The majority prevailed in Parliament
 Now beyond judiciary, the task of saving the soul of India is on 16 non-bjp cms as it is the states who have to operationalize these acts
 3 cms (punjab / Kerala / WB) have said NO to # caband # NRC
 Time for others to make their stand clear
 — Prashant Kishor (@prashantkishor)december 13, 2019unhone kaha ki baaki mukhyamantriyon ko apana rukh spasht karnaa chahie
 Significantly, after the passage of both the Houses of Citizenship Amendment Bill, PK had tweeted and said that it is being told that its purpose is to give citizenship and not take it
 lekin sachai enarasi ke saath he
 It places a deadly combo in the hands of the government to prosecute them with discrimination on religious grounds
 We are told that # cabis bill to grant citizenship and not to take it from anyone
 But the truth is together with # NRC, it could turn into a lethal combo in the hands of government to systematically discriminate and even prosecute people based on religion
 # notgivingup— Prashant Kishor (@prashantkishor)december 12, 2019bataa den ki jediu adhyaksh nitish kumaar ke is bill kaa samarthan karne ke turant baad hi pike ne iske khilaaf morcha khol diya tha
 PK protested in a tweet and wrote that before endorsing the bill, the party leadership should have also thought about the public who had expressed confidence in the 2015 assembly elections
 While supporting # CAB, the JDU leadership should spare a moment for all those who reposed their faith and trust in it in 2015
 We must not forget that but for the victory of 2015, the party and its managers would not have been left with much to cut any deal with anyone
 — Prashant Kishor (@prashantkishor)december 11, 2019jediune donon sadanon main is bill kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Apart from PK, many other leaders have expressed their displeasure with this decision of the party

 It is now to see how Delhi can prepare Kashmir from this plot, which was once the fifth largest state

 Kashmir was effectively unionized from the time of the arrest of Sheikh Abdullah on August 9, 1953, in view of some whims

 Many Kashmiris have been suspicious for a long time and Mirwaiz has been making it clear that Delhi is only interested in the land of Kashmir, not the people there

 com / wr7qvwehut a bomb has been detonated amidst political pullout in Balochistan, Pakistan
 yahaan queta main vidhansabha ke paas shaktishaalee bam visphot hua he
 Six people including four policemen have died in this blast, while 17 people have been injured
 yah visphot queta ke jargun road par hua he, jo vidhansabha se kareeb 300 meter kii duuri par he
 This attack is being described as suicidal
 jisamen mukhya rup se police vaahan ko nishaanaa banane kii koshish kii gai he
 The bombings took place at a time when a special session of the assembly was called to vote on the no-confidence motion against the Chief Minister of Baluchistan, Sanaullah Zehri
 haalanki, mukhyamantri ke istipha dene ke baad satr ko sthagit kar diya gaya
 Senior police officer Farooq Atik has confirmed that a police vehicle was targeted in the blast
 media reports ke mutabik, motorcycle savaar ek aatmghaatee hamalavar baluchistan vidhansabha bhawan ko nishaanaa banane kii koshish main tha, lekin usne hai security vaale red jone ilaake main visphot kar diya
 a large number of security personnel were present where the blast took place, as one session of the Balochistan Assembly was just over
 is ilaake main kai mahatvapurn sarkari imaaraten bhi hai
 Political crisis in the province, Chief Minister of Baluchistan Nawab Sanaullah Zehri resigned from his post on Tuesday
 jehri ne yah kadam pradhanmantri shahid khaakaan abbasi dwaara yahaan utpann raajnneetik sankat kaa samaadhaan nikaalane main vifal rahane ke baad diya
 The mlas of Pakistani Mediaarsar, Balochistan expressed their disbelief on the basis of the Chief Minister not 'fulfilling the promise'
 party ke kai mahatvapurn mantri or salaahkaar mukhyamantri ke virdohi ho gaye, kai logon ne istipha de diya or kai ko hataaya gaya
 Everyone is troubled by the constantly rising oil prices
 sarkaar antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii badhati keemton kaa hawala de rahi he
 It is true, but it is not a solution to the problem
 ho saktaa he ki iran sankat ke chalate aane vaale dinon main kachche tel kii keemten or bhi bad sakati hai
 The government will have to rein in this, but the biggest question is how? dikkat ye he ki jab kachche tel kii keemten antarrashtriya bazaar main kam thi tab bhi bharat sarkaar ne tel kii keemat kam nahin kii or apana khajaana bharti rahi
 Now a central minister of the government has argued that the money coming to the government from the increased oil prices is spent in road construction and other public interest schemes
 sarkaar ne november 2014 se lekar farvari 2016 tak 9 baar tel kii exaij duty badhaai haalanki us vakt antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemten kam thim
 During this period, the government increased petrol prices from time to time by 12 rupees 2 paise, while during this period the government increased the prices of diesel by 13 rupees 7 paise
 ek taraf sarkaar ne 9 baar tel kii keemten badhaai hai vahiin ek baar kam bhi kii he
 On October 4, 2017, the prices of petrol and diesel were reduced by Rs 2-2
 aise halaat main fikki ke adhyaksh rajesh shah kaa bayaan mahatvapurn he jisamen unhone kaha ki kul exaij duty petrol par 11 ru77 paise prati litre or dijal par 13 ru 47 paise prati litre badhaai ja chuki he jabaki sirf 2 ru prati litre ghatai gai he
 Therefore, there is scope to reduce excise duty
 tippaniyan Amidst all this, you will be shocked to know how is the profitability of the oil companies of your country
 amuman aise halaat main in companiyon kii buree haalat honi chahie magar aisa he nahin
 Indian Oil's profit was 5 thousand crores in March 2013, which increased to 19 thousand crores in 2017 and 21 thousand crores in March 2018
 yahi nahin, tel kii keemat badhaane main rajya sarkaron kaa bhi haath hota he maharashtra, madhyapradesh, andhrapradesh main prati litre 35 fisadi se adhik waite he
 Actually the state governments also do not want to give up their profits on oil
 aise haalat main logon ko raahat mili to mili kaise
 First of all, the central and state governments will have to reduce their profits slightly by meeting with the oil companies so that the common people can get relief
 varanaa jo halaat hai antarrashtriya bazaar kii tel kii keemton main aag lagi rahegi
 This year, the government's oil bill may increase by 20 percent
 abhi jo tel kaa bill 88 arab dollar he, vah 105 arab dollar tak ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, the hope of relief should be kept low, if the government reduces its profit then relief can be expected

 is sabake bich aap yah jaan kar chaunk jaaenge ki apane desh kii tel companiyon ke munaafe kaa kya haal he
 Usually, in such a situation, these companies should be in bad shape, but it is not so
 indian oil kaa munafa march 2013 main 5 hajaar karod tha jo ki 2017 main bad kar 19 hajaar karod or march 2018 main 21 hajaar karod ho gaya
 Not only this, state governments also have a hand in increasing the price of oil, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh have more than 35% VAT per liter
 darasal rajya sarkarein bhi tel par apana munafa chhodana nahin chaahati hai
 If people get relief in such a situation, how can we get it sabase pehle kendra or rajya sarkaron ko tel companiyon ke saath baithak kar apana munafa thodaa thodaa kam karnaa padegaa jisase ki aam logon ko raahat mil sake
 Otherwise, the international market oil prices will be on fire
 is saal sarkaar kaa tel bill 20 fisadi tak bad saktaa he
 The oil bill currently at $ 88 billion can go up to $ 105 billion
 aise main raahat kii ummid kam hi rakhni chahie yadi sarkaar apana munafa kam karti he to phir raahat kii ummid kii ja sakati he

 Chinoy says, "despite coming down, they were constantly firing bullets at me with rifles
 
 
 mujhe rifl se chal rahi goliyon kii awaazon ke saath-saath anti-aircraft ganon kii bhi jor se aa rahi awaazen sunai de rahi thim
 
 
 When i landed while avoiding the bullets of these rifles, they were screaming and abusing and saying 'kill-kill'

 "maine suraj ke chhipane kaa intazaar kiya

 england ke cricketer mat praayar or stuart broad ne mangalvaar raat britain ke ek vyakti ko suicide karne se bachaa liya
 The man was preparing to commit suicide by jumping from a bridge close to the team hotel in Sydney
 sthaneey akhbaar da telegraph kii rirpot ke anusaar, apni sooyeeboojh se wicketiper praayar or broad ne us vyakti ko kareeb ek ghante tak baton main uljhaae rakhaa, jiske baad maukey par police pahunch gai
 The newspaper quoted Prior as saying, 'we did what anyone in that condition would do
 ham us vyakti kii madad karne kii koshish kar rahe the jo pareshaan or hataash tha
 i am glad that we got out of the bar at the right time and were there on time to help him
 ’ donon khilaadiyon kaa maananaa he ki vah vyakti britain kaa tha
 He threw his phone, passport and purse into the water
 jaankaree ke anusaar pehle jab khilaadiyon ne us vyakti ko dekha to sochaa ki vah pul kii railing par khadaa he, lekin baad main unhen sthiti kii gambhirtha kaa andaja hua
 The two players were returning from a program organized to raise funds for the charity of the 'barmy Army' on Tuesday night
 team ke suraksha adhikari terry minish ne bhi us vyakti ko aatmahatya se rokane main praayar kii madad kii
 Minish said, 'on the way to the hotel, we saw the young man standing on the side of the bridge, who was about to jump
 praayar ne use pul ke kinare se khinchaa or police ke aane tak usase baat karata rahaa
 All this happened very fast
 ’ In 2014, when Malaysia's aircraft MH370 suddenly went missing, its search and passengers' lives prevailed prominently in the news for several days
 wo vimaan kahaan gaya or yatriyon kaa kya hua, kisi ko nahin maaloom
 a total of 239 people were on board, of which 227 were passengers
 kisi ke bhi jivit hone kii sambhaavna na ke baraabar hi he
 This event may have become history, but it had created earthquakes in the world of news
 duniyabar kii nazaren isi ek khabar par hafton tiki hui thim
 One such scene is also of the accident on patna-indore Express near Kanpur
 marane waalon kii taadaad ab tak145 kaa aankada paar kar chukihai
 More people are injured, many of whom are in critical condition
 hindi ke channelon or akhabaaron par yah khabar he zarur lekin internet ke aankade dekhen to angrezi kaa pathakvarg iske prati udasin he
 He came to know about the incident
 jaankaree le lee or bas aage bad liye
 So the people who died in the Karel accident are just numbers for us, which is enough to look like the score or date calendar of a match
 kya ham itane asamvedansheel or udasin ho chuke hai ki itani badi sankhya main logon kaa maranaa or ghayal hona hamen vichlit nahin karata
 Or is it because the people killed in this accident were not traveling on expensive price tickets, using the fastest, developed and modern system of transport like airplanes in which resourceful people from all over the world travel
 
 jo log haadase main maare gaye wo sleeper class ke duusari shrenee ke dibbon main savaar the
 It is obvious that these are the general public, poor, students and workers traveling on low income and cheap tickets
 bharat ke itane bade loktantr ke liye inaki ahmiyat bhedon jitani he
 What kind of educated and sensitive middle class is this that does not see the death of anyone with pain unless its class is hurt
 yah kisi swaarthvatta he jo keval kapadon, paison or ohadon ke aadhaar par logon kii zindagiyon kii keemat pahchaanana chahta he
 People are being pulled out by cutting cartons scattered like papers on railway tracks
 baahar aate-aate log mar rahe hai
 Children do not even have the consciousness to name their father
 maa apane bacchon kii tasviir haath main liye goongi ho gai he
 The elders are watching their new blood calm before their eyes
 is dard ke manzar main raajnneeti, express-ve,fiter vimaan, sansad or naaron ke sivaay kuch bhi na kaha ja rahaa he or na suna, dekha ja rahaa he
 At the time, people were battling to death in this accident and were waiting for each breath to look forward for help, after two words of condolence by the Prime Minister, some distance from Kanpur, publicity of his plans and populist speech for the assembly elections Were giving in prabhaviton ko madad der se mili or isliye bhi mritkon kii sankhya badhati gai
 Closed notes were distributed as relief to those battling in the hospital for life
 haadase se kuch duuri par soobe kii sarkaar apane mahaan sadak project kaa locarpan karne main vyast rahi
 From the government to the opposition, there are only words of formality of sorrow and regret for these affected and nothing else
 kalpana kiijie ki yah khabar kisi mahanagar kii hoti
 If such an accident happened in Delhi's metro or in a five-star hotel , all the channels of English would throw all their power on it
 madhyamvarg keval isi kii charchaa main sarabor rahata
 The ruling and opposition would have been making big statements and demonstrations
 isi railgadee kii jagah haadasa agar kisi hawaijahaz main hota to sara desh keval yahi kah sun rahaa hota
 So, will the value of life be determined only on the basis of our income and prosperity
 agar centre or rajyon kii sarkarein is haadase ke baad vaaki hill jaatin to raahat se lekar parijanon kii khoj tak kaa kaam tej ho saktaa tha
 We are living in a time when the dream of bullet train is more important news than this incident and more is told
 satta kii ore se bhi or media kii ore se bhi
 Sadly, in the era of dreaming, we are calm on basic questions
 sarkarein sapane bech rahi hai
 One is landing a fighter plane on the expressway, while another is preparing for a bullet train like Japan
 lekin is dauraan jarjar hote railway ke aadharbhoot dhaanche kii pole aisi mautein kholti ja rahi hai or ham in mauton par ankhen munde aage bad rahe hai
 The railway accident in Kanpur is a big accident and not to consider it a big accident is a big mistake
 is bhul kii gunjaaish na to maanavtaa detii he or na hi samvidhan
 But if the death is of the poor, then the mistakes of the dead are left full
 shamshaan main chitaaon ke thande hone se pehle hamaari chetnaaon kaa thanda ho janaa iskaa jalataa udhaaharan he

 kendriya jal sansaadhan mantri or bijepi kii fire brands netaa uma bharti ne film star shahrukh khan ko lekar ek vivaadit bayaan diya he
 Reacting to the incident of stopping Shah Rukh Khan at the US airport, Uma Bharti said that now he would like India
 darrlas, apane ek din ke chote se daure par madhyapradesh ke ujjain pahunchi uma bharti ne ye bayaan media se baat karne ke dauraan diya
 Uma Bharti reached Ujjain on Saturday morning and went to see Mahakal temple first
 uske baad uma bharti circuit house par patrakaron se rubaru ho rahi thi
 At the same time, Uma Bharti gave this response to Aaj Tak's question
 jab uma bharti se poocha gaya ki america main shahrukh khan ko ghanton airport par suraksha jaanch ke liye roak kar rakhaa gaya to jawaab main uma bharti ne kaha ki aise maamle se ek baat acchhee ho jaaegi, inako bharat desh acha lagane lag jayega
 It is believed that Uma's statement is a sarcasm on Shah Rukh Khan's statement that he had given intolerance in the country
 ek kaarykram ke dauraan shahrukh ne kaha tha ki desh main ashishnutaa bad rahi he
 After Shah Rukh's statement there was a lot of ruckus and after this, Shah Rukh Khan's film Dilwale also saw the impact of the statement and the film did not perform well

 In this, he is criticizing the statement made by Indian Army Chief Bipin Rawat regarding Pakistan
 paak videsh mantri ne twit main kaha ki ''bhartiya sena pramukh kaa bayaan behad gaiyr jimmedaarana he
 It is about to invite a nuclear attack

 Their doubt will soon go away, inshallah
 ''shameful to see Shashi Tharoor liking tweets by ex Foreign Minister of Pakistan insulting India’s Army Chief! But then that is expected of the Congress leaders

 Tharoor said that i have liked it so that it is within my reach (bookmark) and when the time comes i can use them

 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has made a big statement on the demands made to build the Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, the chairman of the trust that is going to build the Ram temple in Ayodhya
 sangh ke prachaarak rahe or maujuuda samay vihip ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh chanpat raay ne yahaan patrakaron se baatcheet main aisi maangon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki trust main sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ko nahin hona chahie
 However, he did not give any reason for this to the journalists
 baad main vihip ke ek rashtriya padaadhikari ne kaha, "sangh ke sheersh padaadhikari kisi trust kaa khud hissaa banane main vishwaas nahin rakhte
 There is no such tradition in the Sangh
 sangh pramukh ke saamne agar koi prastaav rakhega bhi to vah inkaar kar denge
 "let us know that in the past, Mahant Paramhans Maharaj had demanded to make Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat the chairman of the trust to be built for construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya
 unhone kaha tha ki iske liye vah (mahant paramhans) anshan par bhi baith sakate hai
 In such a situation, when the VHP national vice president visited Nagpur, journalists raised a question related to it
 jiske jawaab main unhone kaha ki sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ko ram mandir trust kaa adhyaksh nahin bananaa chahie
 a VHP official said, "sangh pracharaks or senior officials believe in advancing the work of the society only through the people of the society
 khud trust main pad lenaa unhen uchit nahin lagata

 She did not stop to ask what rights does the Prime Minister's wife have? If there were some other time, these questions might have come easily - but two or four days before that, Mrs Modi had said that if Modiji will call and call then he is ready to come to the Prime Minister's residence
 aise main sawaal yah he ki jo maun koi chaar dashak se chalaa aa rahaa tha, vah aaj tuutane kyon laga? agar rashtrakavi maithilisharan gupt hote to shaayad jasodaben kii pidaa ko zyada sateek aawaaj dete
 Because in the modern literature of Hindi, he is the creator who gave high status to those deprived heroines like Urmila and Yashodhara, who had to sacrifice only for the promotion of their husband
 jashodaben kii kahani bhi kuch aisi hi he
 There were flying discussions about him only when Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, but the first authentic information of his existence came just before this Lok Sabha election
 indian express main chape is intervyuu main jasoda ben ne kaha tha ki unki devi maa se yahi fariyaad he ki modiji pradhanmantri bane or tarakkee karen
 (keep in mind that Mrs Modi refused to be photographed for this interview

 Nationalist Congress Party President Sharad Pawar said on Saturday that he is worried for Union Minister Nitin Gadkari as he is being projected as a possible alternative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi

 Talking to reporters in Solapur, Maharashtra, Pawar said, "gadkari is my friend
 hamalogon ne saath kaam kiya he
 His name (as an alternative to Modi) is being introduced and that is why i am worried for him
 '' pavaar ne is bare main or kuch nahin kaha
 He said that his party is not talking about Raj Thackeray's alliance with Maharashtra Navnirman Sena
 bataa den ki nitin gadakari kai martabaa apane bayanon kii vajah se bijepi netaaon ke liye hi chintaa kaa sabab ban chuke hai
 However, every time Gadkari blames the media for misrepresenting his statements
 lekin unke bayanon par vipakshi dal modi sarkaar par hamalaa karte hue najar aate hai
 Recently, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had described Nitin Gadkari as an advocate for his statements
 unhone twit kiya tha ki gadakari ji, aapaki saraahna karata hum
 You are the only one in the BJP who has some courage
 ' unhone kaha, ‘kripaya aap (gadakari) rafel ghotaale or anil ambani, kisaanon kii pidaa or sansthaaon ko nasht kiye jane par bhi tippanee kariye

 aanan-fanan main congress ke tamaam bade netaa chunaav ayog dastak dene pahunche
 Ahmed Patel, Ashok Gehlot, Randeep Surjewala, Anand Sharma, RPN Singh, Sushmita Dev, Raja Brar all appeared in the Central Election Commission late at 9
15 pm
 FIR radd ho or agar nahin to isi maamle main pradhanmantri modi, vitt mantri arun jetali, kendriya mantri piyush goyal or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah par bhi FIR ho is par congressi netaa jor dete rahe
 But this is the inside story of what happened within the Election Commission
 ye he insaide story
 
 
 When the Congress leader arrived at the Election Commission, the commission was ready for a quick hearing
 mukhya chunaav ayukta eke jyoti khud vahaan maujuud the
 The beginning was made by senior Congress leader and Deputy Leader of Congress in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma
 anand sharma ne tamaam vah baaten uthaai jo congress party ne apni press vijyapti main rakhi thi, yani chunaav aachaar samhita lagu hone ke baad yaa yun kahen ki chunaav prachaar samaapt hone ke samay ke baad 8 taarikh ko bijepi kaa ghoshnaa patr jari hua, jisamen arun jetali samet tamaam netaa maujuud the
 Prime Minister Modi held four big rallies on 9 December
 jisko gujarati samet tamaam rashtriya channelon ne dikhaaya
 On Wednesday, Piyush Goyal's press conference was placed in front of the commission, while Amit Shah's statement answering Manmohan was also brought under the scanner
 iske turant baad ashok gahalot jo gujarat congress ke prabharee mahasachiv hai, unhone video dikhaaya jisamempradhanmantri modichunaav prachaar samaapt hone kii taarikh or samay yani 7 disambar shaam ko 5:00 baje ke baad yah kehete dikhe ki 9 taarikh ko or 14 taarikh ko bijepi ko vot den
 Ashok Gehlot asked the Commission whether this election is not a direct violation of the code of conduct and why action was not taken on it
 iske baad baari ai congress ke media prabharee randeep surajevaala kii, jinhone ek-ek karke hindi main sari baaten ayog ke saamne rakhi
 Perhaps Surjewala knew that Anand Sharma had spoken in English
 tamtamaae sonia gandhi ke sachiv ahamed patel, jo amuman parde ke peeche se puri ranneeti banaate rahe hai, unhone sirf itnaa hi kaha kiraahul gandhi neagar intervyuu diya he to usamen kahin janata se vot nahin maanga
 The Congress was exerting pressure, asking the Commission to prove its impartiality
 tabhi purv grih rajya mantri or congress ke varisht netaa arpyen singh bole, 'jis tarah chunaav ayog ne rajyasabha chunaav ke dauraan gujarat main ahamed patel ke masale par do vidhayakon kaa vot radd karne kaa faisla sunaaya tha or apni nishpakshta sabit kii thi, thik vaise hi chunaav ayog apni garima ko sabit kare, main ayog se yahi vinati karata hum
 'after this, the commission said that you have said your point, we will decide on this as soon as possible after investigating it
 aise main congress netaaon ne ayog se kaha, 'dekhie vakt kam he, kal hi matdaan he
 You have to take a decision late tonight or tomorrow morning
 ' ayog ne kaha, 'ham jaanch-padtaal ke baad jaldi se jaldi apana paksh or ection saamne rakhenge
 After this, the Congress leaders came out and confronted the media
 congress ko ummid he ki ayog kuch naa kuch karegaa
 That is why the Congress had already called the Youth Congress workers outside the Election Commission along with the women Congress workers
 vah taiyaari kar rahi thi ki agar ayog ne uski nahin suni or use thos aashwaasan nahin diya to der raat 11:00 baje dharne par baith jaaegi
 But after reasoning with its delegation for about one and a quarter hours, the Congress feels that the Commission will do something
 isliye usne baad main apane youth congress or mahila congress ke kaaryakartaaon ko waapas jane ko kah diya or dharne kii baat philhal chhod di
 Overall, the election of Gujarat for Narendra Modi and Amit Shah coming from Gujarat in the politics of the country is a matter of interest, then the Congress feels that the election of Gujarat for the Congress which is extinguished, submerged, fallen and backfoot should prove to be a new dawn
 Can
 ham kisi se jor jabardastee bharat mata kii jai kaa naaraa lagane ke liye nahin kah sakate
 Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said this while commenting on the political resolution passed in the bjp's national executive
 bijepi ne apane prastaav main kaha tha ki bharat mata kii jai kehane se inkaar karnaa apane aap main samvidhan kaa apmaan karne jaisaa he
 Some people have difficulty with Bharat Mata ki Jai that needs to be understood
 bharat ke bare main kisi ko aitraaj nahin he
 People are questioning Bharat Mata ki Jai
 mere liebharat mataho sakati he
 Bharat Mata also deserves respect for some other people
 hinduon or musalamaanon main badi aabaadi ko isse koi dikkat nahin, lekin kuch musalamaanon ko dikkat hoti he
 Bharat Mata is like a Hindu goddess
 She said that some Muslims like Bharat Mata Hindu god
 hindu sanghathanon ne bharat mata kii tasviir bhi devi jaisi banaai he
 Goddess with six arms on lion
 unki puja bhi karte hai
 This troubles Muslims
 unka kahana he ki jai hind bolenge, hindustan jindabad bolenge lekin hamen bharat mata kii jai bolne mat kahie
 Our democracy and constitution give them the freedom to say or not to say Bharat Mata ki Jai
 hamen iskaa sammaan karnaa chahie
 Congress MP also said that the constitution gives us the right to freedom to speak
 thik usee tarah chup rahane kaa adhikaar bhi detaa he
 We cannot put a word in someone's mouth
 bhartiya janata party ke netritv vaale rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (NDA) main hi nahin balki congress kii aguwai vaale mahagathbandhan main bhi siton ko lekar sahyogi dalon ne tevar dikhaane shuru kar die hai
 There are five states from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to Karnataka, out of which the Congress has not yet decided its allies in many states and there are many states where there is a riot for seat sharing among allies
 bihar main fansaa pechbihar main endie ke sahyogi bijepi, jediu or algepi ke bich seat shering kaa formula tay ho gaya he
 At the same time, the Mahagathbandhan includes Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Upendra Kushwaha's party RLSP, Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hum and Sharad Yadav
 in dalon ke alaava congress madhepura se saansad pappu yadav ko apane saath jodne kii koshish main he
 If sources are to be believed, Manjhi is claiming the Purnia Lok Sabha seat
 is seat par abhi jediu se santosh kumaar saansad hai
 Manjhi claims that there are 6 lakh Dalit voters in this seat, so they should get this seat
 congress chaahati he ki pappu yadav ko madhepur kii jagah is baar purniya se chunaav lade taaki madhepura seat sharad yadav ko di ja sake
 Although Pappu Yadav is currently an MP from Madhepura, he has previously won elections from Purnia seat in 1996 and 1999
 isi ke chalate purniya seat pappu yadav ko dena chaahati he, lekin maanjhi ke daawey ke baad congress pasopesh main pad gai he
 Apart from this, no seat sharing has yet been decided between RJD, Congress and RLS
 maharashtra main 8 siton par maamla uljhaamaharashtra main congress or ensipi milakar loksabhaa chunavi maidan main utarana chaahati hai, lekin abhi tak seat shering ko lekar donon dalon ke bich sahmati nahin ban saki he
 NCP leader Ajit Pawar said that talks with the Congress on 8 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra could not be completed
 in siton main pune or ahmednagar seat bhi shaamil he
 While Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil's son Sujay Vikhe Patil has said that if the Congress does not field him from the Ahmednagar seat in the Lok Sabha elections, he can contest on the ticket of another party
 vahiin, is seat ko lekar ensipi bhi dabaav banane main juty he
 How many seats for JDS in Karnataka? Congress and JDS are running the government together in Karnataka, but the picture is not clear about whether they will fight together in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 karnataka ke mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki janata dal (secular) ne 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav ke liye congress se seat saajha karne ke mudde par abhi tak koi charchaa nahin kii he
 Who will be an ally in Uttar Pradesh? In Uttar Pradesh, it is not yet decided with whom the Congress will enter the electoral fray
 jabaki sapa-basapa bina congress ko saath liye chunaav gathbandhan karne kii ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 In such a situation, then the Congress has the option of entering the electoral arena either alone or with small parties
 aise main congress ke vipakshi ekta ko bada jhatka lag saktaa he
 Congress in West Bengal on two roads: Will the Congress in West Bengal contest with Left parties or will Mamata Banerjee's party tie up with TMC? The picture is not clear about this
 haalanki, congress donon partiyon ke saath behatar talmail banaakar chal rahi he, lekin yah bhi sach he ki maujuuda samay main bengal kii raajnneeti main vampanthi dalon se zyada tiemasi majboot he
 More examinations of the Central Board of Secondary Education have come into the limelight
 12veen or 12veen kaksha ke board paper li hone ke baad jeii mens pariksha ke paper par bhi sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai
 In fact, a student who appeared in the JEE examination on Sunday has filed a complaint that a section of the paper given in the examination conducted on Sunday is like a mock test

 Students allege that about 7 questions in Physics section of set-c paper are same as mock test of coaching center
 unka aarope he ki sawaal main prashn kii vailu main bhi badlaav nahin hua he or sawaal bilkul vaise hi hai
 Students have complained about this paper to CBSE, which conducts the JEE examination
 JEE MAIN 2018: is baar ye ho sakati he cat-of, jald aegi ansar kitioai kii khabar ke anusaar chaatro ne ye bhi kaha he ki pariksha ke sirf sawaal hi ek jaise nahin he, balki jawaab ke liye die gaye chaar opshan bhi vaise hi he
 According to the students, questions number 64, 67, 77, 78, 81, 83, 86 and 87 resemble mock tests
 vahiin is mudde par koching centre ne in daavon ko khaarij kiya he
 The Center says that these questions were asked in the 2016 final and this question is also in many books
 JEE Main Exam: aasaan tha pehla paper, dekhen- puraa analisisgauratlab he ki sibiesai kii ore se yojit kii gai pariksha main 1043739 ummidavaaron ne bhaag liya tha or yah pariksha 112 shaharon main 1621 pariksha kendron par karwaae gai thi

 har insaan ko swasth jivan ke liye behatar neend kii jarurat hoti he
 Adults usually need 6 to 7 hours of restful sleep
 acchhee neend se kai phaayde hote hai
 After getting enough sleep, the ability to work on awakening increases
 isse yaaddasht bhi badhati he
 The behavior is moderate

 assam ke zikr se pehle to puure rajya bhar main halchal much gai
 But if analyzed properly, it became clear that how much danger is being raised in this state of Northeast facing riots and separatist violence for decades
 assam main pichley teen saal main kareeb 160 log maare gaye hai
 All of them were killed in clashes between Muslims (alleged infiltrators from Bangladesh) and non-muslims or 'natives' (as they are called)
 in 160 mritkon main 80 fisadi musalmaan the
 50 Muslims were killed this year, that too only in the month of May
 neshnal democratic front of bodoland (endiefabi) ke ugravadiyon ne unhen isliye maut ke ghat utaar diya kyonki unhone loksabhaa chunaav main gaiyr-bodo ummidavaar kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Experts believe that this violence in a long-troubled state is the result of increased sensitivity and new mobilization in communities about their identity
 mote taur par sabhi gaiyr-muslim samudaay sankhyabal main ijaphe ke liye ek akhil-hindu chhatari ke neeche ikddha hote dekhe ja rahe hai
 The danger is that to increase their strength in the state, political parties are using the increasing sensitivity of identity among communities
 tanaavon kii bhatti ko is kadar garma diya gaya he ki kyon or kya jaise sawaal bemaani ho gaye hai
 Consequently , the announcement of Jawahiri will only add to it
 bijepi assam main 2016 kaa vidhansabha chunaav jeetne kii ummid kar rahi he or iske liye vah sampradayik rup se sabase zyada bhadakaau mudde kii sawari kar rahi he
 For example, illegally settled Muslims from Bangladesh threaten the existence of local people
 assam bijepi ke varisht pravaktaa bijoy mahajan kehete hai, “video ne vahi sabit kiya jo assam ke log dashakon se mahasoos karte aa rahe hai
 This is a conspiracy to make Assam an Islamic state and illegal Muslim residents are their game pieces
 ”jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki bijepi kaa yah ravaiya bevajaah nahin he
 The party won seven Lok Sabha seats this summer, its best performance in the state

 Not only this, in the by-elections held this month where polarization did not have much effect in other parts of the country, BJP in Assam performed better than expected
 usne silchar seat congress se chin lee or muslimbahul ilaakon jamunamukh or lakhipur main apane voton main acchhee-khaasi badhat darj kii
 She was second in Jamunamukh, which is the home constituency of All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) chief Badruddin Ajmal
 rajnatik pandit kehete hai ki bijepi ko zyada kadi mehnat karne kii jarurat nahin padi kyonki rajya main bangladeshi musalamaanon ke khilaaf vidwesh kii jabardast antardhara hameshaa se maujuud rahi he
 Says Nani Gopal Mahant, Associate Professor at Guwahati University, "the Muslim votes were divided between the Congress and the AIUDF, both in Lakhipur and Jamunamukh, while the Hindu vote stood united with the BJP

 "that is why Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi could not save his party's credibility in Silchar
 haalanki unhone hindu bengaaliyon ko lubhaane ke liye bangla bhashaa ko baraak ghati main rajbhasha kaa darja dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi

 Assam's geographical location is of strategic importance to Islamic militant factions as it has almost open borders with Bangladesh
 rajya police kii special shakha ke ek sheersh adhikari kehete hai, “yah assam ke liye khatra nahin he; yah rashtriya suraksha kaa sawaal he
 Once the miscreants crossed Assam, it would not take long to spread throughout the country

 Legislative assembly elections in the state are just 20 months away, and every party has started making preparations
 bijepi kaa lakshya asmi hindu jatiyon, duusare gaiyr-muslim samudaayon or adivaasiyon ko saz shatru “musalmaan ghuspaithiyon” ke khilaaf golband karnaa he
 Its "mission 84" (ie 126-member Assam Legislative Assembly winning three-fourths of seats) has an action plan ready based on the influx of illegal immigrants
 bijepi rajya main adivasee samoohon ko lubhaane kii ranneeti par bhi kaam kar rahi he
 For this, the Central Government is planning to give Scheduled Tribe status to six more communities
 is ek kadam se rajya main janajatiyon main bijepi kaa aadhaar majboot hone kii ummid he or adivasee aabaadi badhkar 40 fisadi ho jaaegi
 The party plans to project Union Sports Minister and tribal leader of the state Sarbananda Sonowal as the next Chief Minister
 assam ke liye bijepi ke chunaav prabharee sudhanshu mittal kehete hai, “yah mudda assam ke harek mul nivasee ko choota he kyonki isse rajya kii jansankhya kii sanrachana hameshaa ke liye badal ja sakati he
 There is no place for illegal Muslims from Bangladesh in the state

 The party is doing a 'soft launching' of its 'love Jihad' campaign in Assam
 haalanki yah mudda abhi netaaon ke bhaashanon kaa hissaa nahin bana he
 a top BJP leader from Assam who refrained from revealing his identity, says, "this is the reality
" jaraa assam ke kuch khaas ilaakon main apahrit auraton kii sankhya par gaur kiijie
 "BJP leaders also talk dangerously about sexual crimes against Hindu women in the state
 is saal assam main mandiron main maance phenke jane kii ghatnaayen bhi bade paimaane par dekhi gai hai
 The rumor of getting beef at Silchar's Narasimha temple had led to tension

 cagar's SP Digant Bora says, "that was a remote rumor that was fueled by some anti-social elements
" us mandir main darasal kuch hua hi nahin tha
 ”around the same time, there were reports of similar incidents from Dhubri and Dhing in Naugaon district
 assam police ke mahanireekshak (iji) bataate hai, “dhubri main to koi pratikriya nahin hui kyonki hindu aabaadi bahut kam he lekin dhing main tanaav tha

 The largest center of the RSS is also located here which conducts examinations for pracharaks in the Northeast
 goswami kehete hai, “yah suniyojit ghatana thi or aisa pehali baar nahin hua
 The local media is now reporting these incidents
 ” goswami kaa daawa he ki aresas yahaan hinduon main dharmik pahchaan kaa bodh jaagrit karne ke liye jamini str par chupchaap kaam kar rahaa he
 Actually, the success of bjp's "mission 84" depends on the ground work of the RSS
 yah aresas hi he jisane assam ke chaay baganon main hindu bhaawanaaon ko jagaane ke liye jagah banaai he
 The BJP has also started recruiting new members and training them on the party's core principles at district headquarters
 magar dhruvikaran ekatarfa nahin ho rahaa he
 During a rally for the assembly by-election in Jamunamukh on 9 September, Lok Sabha MP from Barpeta and brother of Badruddin Ajmal, Sirajuddin announced that the AIUDF chief would be the next Chief Minister of Assam
 sirajuddin kaa yah bayaan front ke badhate janaadhar se prerit tha
 The AIUDF was founded by Ajmal in 2005 and has since presented itself as a caretaker and caretaker of Muslims
 eiudief vidhansabha main sabase bada vipakshi dal he or 2016 main kam-se-kam 35 siton par jeet hasil karne ke saath kingmekar banakar ubharne kii ummid kar rahaa he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Front won three seats equal to the Congress, while in 2009 it won only one seat
 ajmal musalmaan ghuspaithiyon ke khilaaf bijepi ke aakraamak abhiyaan kaa sidhaa jawaab dene se bachate hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why the Muslim vote bank is constantly moving away from the Congress to the AIUDF
 ajmal kehete hai, “ham maanate hai ki jo bhi shaks 25 march, 1971 ke baad assam main daakhil hua he use hindustan se jarur nikaal baahar karen
 The same date was set in the 1985 Assam Accord as a cut-off to identify illegally intruders
 lekin kai sanghathan gaiyr-kanoonee ghuspaith kaa mudda uthaakar assam kii alpsankhyak jamaaton main dehshat paidaa kar rahe hai
 Why the actual count of Bangladeshis in Assam is not decided once
 ”yahi nahin, ajmal ek kadam or aage badhkar al kaayda ke jawahiri ko aagaah karte hai ki ve assam se dur hi rahen
 He says, "these people are terrorists, not jihadis
" assam ke musalmaan kaaphi samajhadaar hai
 We do not need al Qaeda to defend us
 ”lekin saare musalmaan aashwast nahin hai
 The Muslim Youth Forum Against Communalism, IRS officer Aashik Zaman, who runs an NGO named Terrorism and Sedition, narrates an incident
 vakya 2012 main bodoland hinsa main beghar hue peedit musalamaanon ke raahat shivi kaa he
 Zaman says, "we went there to distribute clothes and books
 kai naujavaanon ne poocha ki kya ham unhen bandook de sakate hai
 These camps are the most fertile ground for spreading Islamist terror
 ”kuch suraksha adhikariyon or enjio se jude logon ko ashanka he ki vidhansabha chunaav se pehle hinsa kii ghatnaayen ho sakati hai
 The reason is that political parties, bound by a ceasefire agreement with the government, can use militants living in 22 camps across the state as mercenaries
 mukhyamantri gogoi ke fike or beasar kaamkaaj se niraash congress bhi is daud main shaamil ho gai he or tanaavon ko hawa de rahi he
 Congress MLA from Roha, Piyush Hazarika told India Today, "shortly after Narendra Modi's rally in Biswanath Charali on April 1, local BJP leader Bhavdev Goswami told a TV channel that the BJP was getting the support of the NDFB rebels
 mujhe puraa yakeen he ki rajya main apana sampradayik agenda lagu karne ke liye party nae aatanki sanghathanon kaa istemaal karegi
 "over the next 20 months, this politics of accusation will be run parallel to the tracks of tension and violence
 sampradayikta kii raajnneeti main dharmik asurakshaayen vot jeetne kaa praathmik jariya ban sakati hai
 Fear and apprehension are not limited to the border of politics
 isse assam kaa saamaajik taana-bana bhi prabhavit ho rahaa he jo pehle se hi bikharata dikh rahaa he
 The apprehension of lagging behind in numbers has also led to communal tension in the state's most cosmopolitan city of Guwahati
 goalpada ke rahane vaale iares adhikari aashiq jamaa ko guwahati main kiraye par makaan dene se isliye inkaar kar diya gaya kyonki ve musalmaan hai

 He was eventually rescued by the police

 Among these, there is a far greater danger for Assam

 Sachin Tendulkar is a very emotional person but specializes in hiding his feelings
 unhone kabhi khulkar kaha nahin, lekin unki dili tamanna thi ki maa unhen aakhri baar khelte dekhen, shaayad isiilie unhone aakhri match vankhede main khilne kii ichha jataai

 He specializes in hiding emotions
 unke imoshan dekhen to log dang rah jaaenge
 But he does not tell the heart easily
 main jaanati hum ki vah chaahate the ki maa unka aakhri match dekhne stadium aaen
 Perhaps that's why he expressed his desire to play the last Test in Wankhede
 ''sachin ko ghar par dekhne kii aadat daalani hogi'anjali ne bataaya ki sachin ke liye sanyas ek imotional faisla tha, jise unhone bahut achche se sambhala

 anjali ne kaha ki sanyas ke baad sachin ko ghar par dekhnaa unke liye thodaa aswabhaavik to hoga hi
 He said, 'we have a habit of Sachin who plays cricket and is often out
 hamen unke kareeb hone kii aadat daalani hogi
 It will be different for them too
 vah jab bhi ghar par hote hai, kamiyaan khojate rahete hai jaise vahaan li ho rahaa he, yahaan paint utar rahaa he
 Now he will be at home all the time, so do not know how it will be

 "his first relationship with cricket, then family" Anjali said that cricket is her first love even before marriage
 unhone kaha, 'unka pehla rishta cricket, desh or mumbai se he
 Then we are from the people
 'vankhede par ballebaaji ke liye utarane se pehle sachin ne jameen chhukar pranaam kiya tha
 When Anjali was asked about this, she told, 'he did it in the last Ranji match too
 maine camere par unhen dekh liya tha
 Later when i mentioned it to him, he said - well you notice
 vankhede main dobaaraa unhone aisa kiya
 'anjali told,' When his children were born, Sachin was playing international cricket and was the star of the country
 unhone us star ko to dekha he
 But he will probably be able to see Sachin's father completely
 sara to bahut kuch apane papa jaisi he
 She also keeps her emotions hidden like this
