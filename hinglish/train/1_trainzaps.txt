 Sixteen girls said - and Jillilahi's justice
 
 
 akbar- ham ek lafz nahin sunanaa chaahate hai
 Akbar's justice is his order
 tum sabko me tu bhul janaa hoga
 Sixteen Girls - Gotta Forget? akbar- yaqinan, or sirf janata ko bhi yaqiin dilaanaa hoga ki akbar ne tum logon ke saath aisa kuch nahin kiya
 Sixteen girls - those who could not fear Akbar, how will they deny Akbar? akbar- tum kaneez ho
 You guys have started becoming the Mallika of India in the 2019 elections
 me tu kaa kuubasurat bahaanaa dhund liya he
 Sixteen Girls - This is not true
 khuda gavaah he
 This is not true
 akbar- tum sabko sabit karnaa hoga ki yahi sach he
 Patiala Court is right next to us here

 Sixteen Girls - Parvadarigar! Give us courage ham apni baat se nahin mukar sakati hai
 Emperor Akbar, you cannot forget your promise
 akbar- koun sa vaada, mujhe kuch yaad nahin
 i did not promise you
 solah ladkiyaan- beti bachaao, beti padhaao kaa vaada kiya tha aapane
 Don't you remember anything! akbar- main is akbar ko nahin hataa saktaa
 How can i punish myself? main akbar ko sazaa kaise de saktaa hum
 Sixteen girls - Jillilahi, you and your justice will be remembered in the date of Hindustan
 akbar- main insaaf karne nahin, chunaav jeetne aayaa hum
 We are helpless
 apane usulon ke gulam hai
 If you look at the helplessness of a slave, then perhaps you will be able to forgive us
 solah ladkiyaan- kya yahi aapaki in-e-akabari he? Akbar: If you want, we can give you anonymous life
 hindi akhbaaron ke ghulaam maalikon ko bulaakar akbar kii sari khabaren mitwa sakate hai
 We will erase from the memory of Hindustan that sixteen girls showed Akbar's wounds on their bodies
 solah ladkiyaan- ham par jo guzari he, usase bhi aapkaa dil nahin pighla
 We are sorry for Jillailahi
 akbar aapke darbar main he
 Akbar- Face the force of our 97 lawyers
 ijalas main jaakar gavaahi do
 Akbar cannot exist without Akbar
 mujhe akbar chahie
 Sixteen Girls - We want Akbar too

 Sleep breaks down in the morning

 What will you do after 2019? Someone had told the caller what i had dreamed

 tum logon ne 2019 ke chunaav main hindustan kii mallika banane kii aarazu kii he
 Have found a beautiful excuse for me too
 solah ladkiyaan- yah sach nahin he
 God is a witness
 ye sach nahin he
 Akbar: You all have to prove that this is true
 patiala court yaheen bagal hamen hai
 This army of 97 lawyers will crush you
 solah ladkiyaan- paravaradigaar! hamen himmat ata kar
 We can't back our words

 How can i punish Akbar? solah ladkiyaan- zilleilahi, aap or aapkaa insaaf, hindustan kii tarikh main yaad kiya jayega
 Akbar - i have come to win elections, not justice

 They are slaves to their principles
 ek gulam kii bebasii par gaur karegi to shaayad tum hamen maaf kar sakogi
 Sixteen Girls- Is This Your iin-e-akbari? akbar- tum chaaho to ham tumhen gumnaam zindagi de sakate hai
 All the news of Akbar can be erased by calling the slave owners of Hindi newspapers
 hindustan kii yaad se ham yah baat mitaa denge ki solah ladakiyon ne apane jism par pade akbar ke ghaav dikhaae the
 Sixteen girls - Your heart did not melt even with what has passed on us 
 zilleilahi hamen afsos he
 Akbar is in your court
 akbar- hamaare 97 vakeelon kii fouj kaa saamana karo
 Go and witness in the congregation
 akbar ke bagair akbar nahin ho saktaa
 i want Akbar solah ladkiyaan- hamen bhi akbar chahie
 That's when my youtube hangs
 akbar kii nazar mujh par pad jaati he
 Akbar's clanking voice calls to me

 Sixteen Girls - Parvadarigar! Give us courage ham apni baat se nahin mukar sakati hai
 Emperor Akbar, you cannot forget your promise

 Sixteen girls - Jillilahi, you and your justice will be remembered in the date of Hindustan

 If you look at the helplessness of a slave, then perhaps you will be able to forgive us
 solah ladkiyaan- kya yahi aapaki in-e-akabari he? Akbar: If you want, we can give you anonymous life
 hindi akhbaaron ke ghulaam maalikon ko bulaakar akbar kii sari khabaren mitwa sakate hai
 We will erase from the memory of Hindustan that sixteen girls showed Akbar's wounds on their bodies
 solah ladkiyaan- ham par jo guzari he, usase bhi aapkaa dil nahin pighla
 We are sorry for Jillailahi
 akbar aapke darbar main he
 Akbar- Face the force of our 97 lawyers

 Though the people of Bihar have rejected criminal backgrounds and their pseudo-candidates in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, while they had only partial success in the 2010 assembly elections
 magar bahubali ek baar phir surkhiyon main hai or is baar mukaabal darunda main he, jahaan janata dal (united) or rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ne bahuliyon ke samarthan praapt pratyaashee maidan main utaare hai
 The by-election is being held on the seat due to the death of sitting legislator JD (U) Jagmato Devi
 party ne jagamaato devi ke kukhyat bete ajay singh kii navvivaahita kavita singh ko chunavi ran main utaara he
 Ajay Singh married Kavita when he was denied a ticket by the JD (U) leadership due to his criminal background
 ajay ne pitru paksh ke dauraan hi jaldbaaji main 17 sitambar ko vivaah kar liya
 At this, JD (U) gave his wife a ticket as she fulfills the unwritten condition of a candidate with a clean image of JD (U)
 party kaa kavita ko tikat dena uske chhadam sarokaaron ko ujagar kar detaa he kyonki ajay singh kii patni to maatr ek sthanapann ummidavaar hai
 On the other hand, RJD has fielded Parmeshwar Singh, a relative of former JDU MP from Maharajganj, Prabhunath Singh
 prabhunath singh 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav se lalu prasad ke saath hai
 He also has the support of former Siwan MP Shahabuddin and that is why he has emerged as a major challenger to the JD (U) candidate in the by-election
 bihar ke bante hue samaaj main, jahaan chunaav main jati ek nirnaayak tatv he, apradhi aaj bhi apana rutaba jamaaye hue hai
 Perhaps this is the thing that clarifies the fact that why Nitish and Lalu are not avoiding taking off as pseudo-candidates
 yah to saaf he ki is up-chunaav ke nateezon kaa rajg sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par koi asar padane vaala nahin
 But it may be relevant to the battered heroes of Bihar's political landscape
 yahaan acha pradarshan bhale hi lalu ke rajnatik bhavishya ko na sanvaare parantu yah unhen bihar kii raajnneeti main dobaaraa praasangik jarur bana saktaa he
 Lalu has succeeded in bringing two mutually opposed Shahabuddin and Prabhunath Singh in favor of Parmeshwar Singh
 darunda vidhansabha seat ko 2009 ke parisemen ke baad raghunathpur seat se alag karke banaaya gaya he
 Despite the rjd's consistent efforts, Ajay Singh, a formidable name in the local political scene, could not be broken
 haalanki unki apni aapraadhik prishthbhumi unhen chunaav ladane se rokatii he
 But he was successful in winning elections to his mother Jagamato Devi three times in a row
 jagamaato ne farvari 2005 main bataur nirdaleey ummidavaar pehali baar raghunathpur seat se chunaav jeeta tha
 She joined JD (U) only six months later when the elections were held again
 yah badlaav donon ko hi raas aayaa or jagamaato phir se chunaav jeet gayi or is baar jeet kaa antaraal kaaphi bad chukaa tha
 Jagamato Devi completed her triumph in Daronda assembly seat in November 2010, defeating the RJD candidate by 31,135 votes
 jagamaato devi kaa jeet kaa antar hameshaa badhata gaya jo ajay singh ke badhate prabhaav ko vyakt karata tha
 But this time the battle is not easy
 rajg ke maharajaganj se baagi saansad umashankar singh or siwan se nirdaleey saansad om prakaash yadav kaa bhi is kshetra main khaasaa dabadabaa he
 But both of them are yet to open their cards
 lekin paristhitiyaan aasaan nahin hai
 Umashankar has had a figure of thirty-six in the past with Prabhunath and Om Prakash Yadav's bitterness over Shahabuddin makes it unlikely that he will support the RJD candidate
 lekin unki maujuuda rajnatik sthiti-om prakaash yadav ne siwan se jad (you) ke baagi ke taur jeet par darj kii thi-bhi unhen aasaani se jad (you) ummidavaar kaa samarthan nahin karne degi
 This means that the contest in Daronda by-election will be very interesting
 rahul gandhi ke desh lautne ke baad sabase badi utsukata is baat par he ki wo kahaan the
 How did Rahul Gandhi's unknown stay, just as no one knew about the Pandavas' unknown in the Mahabharata
 magar 21veen sadi ke is internet or smart phone (jisamen kai magapixel ke camere hai) yug main rahul kii ek bhi tasviir tak nahin aa pai
 This is happening for the second time in a row with the Gandhi family
 sonia gandhi jab biimaar padi, to america main unka ilaaj hua, magar abhi tak logon ko unki beemaari kaa pataa nahin he
 This Gandhi family is also no less than a puzzle
 yahaan dilli main rahul ke swaagat kii sari taiyaari pehle se tay thi
 Prior to his arrival, Priyanka was responsible for cleaning his house at Tughlaq Lane, then a family lunch, as everyone was keen on how Rahul spent his 56 days
 parivaar ke log khaskar sonia or priyanka sab kuch shuru se ant tak jaananaa chaahati hongi
 But one question still remains a secret that a few days after Rahul went on leave, a Congress worker put some pictures of him on Twitter, saying that Rahul is in Uttarakhand
 congress party main koi bada se bada netaa aisa karne kii jurrat nahin kar saktaa he
 But this man named Jagdish Sharma was also seen giving interviews to the media after Rahul returned fireworks outside Tughlaq Lane
 aakhir us par koi karrwai kyon nahin hui? to kya yah sab gandhi parivaar ke kehane par hua? yah sab paheli he congress kii
 Now the real question is what Rahul has returned thinking, because the way he called power poison in Jaipur, it became clear in the minds of the people that Rahul is reluctantly in politics
 magar is chuttee par jane ke baad kai tarah kii khabaren aane lageen ki rahul congress adhyaksh se naaraaz hai, wo party main apane tareeke se badlaav karnaa chaahate hai, magar sonia ke kareebi log aisa nahin hone dena chaahate
 Then people started questioning the timing of Rahul going on leave as to why he is not in the country to surround the government on the budget session and land acquisition bill
 uske baad kuch varisht netaaon ke bayaan aane lage ki sonia gandhi hi party kaa netritv karen
 It had people like Hansraj Bhardwaj, Sheela Dixit along with Sandeep Dixit
 party main kai netaa rahul ke netritv ko lekar man nahin bana paa rahe hai
 Perhaps a question remains about Rahul's ability and also about the way he works
 magar congress main sabko pataa he ki yah family tay karegaa ki kiski kya bhoomika hogi
 The same thing is applicable even after Priyanka's entry into politics
 ab rahul ko tay karnaa he ki unhen kab kya karnaa he
 The election of the organization has been announced in the Congress
 us chunaav ke baad congress kaa adhiveshan bulaayaa jayega, jisamen congress main sabhi bade faisle lene vaali kaarysmiti kaa bhi chunaav karaayaa jayega
 Currently, this committee has been nominated by the Congress President
 isi adhiveshan main rahul ko adhyaksh banaaya jayega or ho saktaa he party samvidhan main badlaav kar sonia ke liye bhi koi jagah banaaya jaae
 The challenge for Rahul will be how do he keep the synergy between older leaders and leaders of his generation
 rahul ke rukh kaa pataa ravivaar ko dilli main hone vaali kisaan raily main chalegaa, jise safal banane ke liye party purajor koshish kar rahi he
 It is also being said that Rahul will then go on a country tour, so that the pulse of the people can be understood
 yojanaayen to kaaphi kuch hai, magar jab tak kuch nateeja nahin nikalataa, tab tak sawaal bane rahenge
 The first election on which Rahul will be judged once again is the Bihar Assembly elections
 janata parivaar ekajute ho chukaa he
 You will remember that the Janata Parivar was formed to fight the Congress, for which they also supported the BJP
 ab vah bijepi se ladane ke liye congress ke saath janaa chahega
 Rahul will also have to decide what the Congress will do in Bihar
 congress kaaryakatta badi ummid se baithe hai ki rahul kii lambii chuttee ne shaayad unhen kuch aisa sikhaaya hoga ki party kii duubati naiya paar lag jaae

 So unless she is mentally and physically ready, she cannot handle the whole family
 'dear jindagi' se seekhen brallep ke baad life manage karne ke 5 tareekapasand naapsandis umr tak aap main yah samaj viksit ho jaati he ki kisi ladke main aapako kya pasand he or kya nahin
 You are able to choose the right boy for you thoughtfully and there is no possibility of a relationship breaking up

 Some people get married at the age of 20 but after crossing the threshold of 30, they understand that there was no benefit
 aisi shaadiyon main aage chalakar kadavaahat bhi rahane lagati he
 The correct age for age gap marriage is also in the sense that there is not much edge gap between husband and wife
 donon maior hote hai or baat-baat main ladane kii bajaay samajhadaari se kaam lete hai
 My mother and i remain eternally grateful from the bottom of our hearts for all the love and care that were given to Roohi and Yash Johar

 This festival, which comes two days after Diwali, is also known as Yam Dwitiya
 is din mrityu ke devtaa yama kii puja (yam Puja) kaa bhi vidhaan he
 Yamraj thought, "I am going to defeat life
" mujhe koi bhi apane ghar nahin bulaanaa chahta
 It is my religion to follow the goodwill with which the sister is calling me
 ' bahan ke ghar aate samay yamraj ne narak nivas karne vaale jeevon ko mukt kar diya
 Seeing Yamraj coming to his house, Yamuna was not happy with her
 usne snaan kar pujan karke vyanjan paroskar bhojan karaayaa
 Yamraj was pleased with the hospitality of Yamuna and asked the sister to ask for the bride
 yamuna ne kaha, ''bhadra! aap prati varsh isi din mere ghar aayaa karo
 Like me, the sister who gives a comment on this day with respect to her brother, she should not fear you
 ' yamraj ne tathastu kahkar yamuna ko amuly vastrabhushan dekar vid lee
 Since then the tradition of Bhaiya Dooj started
 aisi manyata he ki jo bhai is din aatithy sweekaar karte hai, unhen yama kaa bhay nahin rahata
 For this reason, Yamraj and Yamuna are worshiped on Bhaiya Dooj

 jisamen modi sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha ki raashtra uske logon se banataa he, jameen ke tukdon se nahin
 Rahul Gandhi wrote in the tweet, "the country cannot be unified by dividing Jammu and Kashmir into two parts, imprisoning elected representatives and violating the Constitution
" desh uski janata se banataa he na ki jameen ke tukdon se
 Misuse of powers by the government would prove fatal to national security
 ''national integration isn't furthered by unilaterally tearing apart J&K, imprisoning elected representatives and violating our Constitution
 This nation is made by its people, not plots of land
 This abuse of executive power has grave implications for our national security
 Earlier, former Congress President Rahul Gandhi reacted on Tuesday morning after the Central Government removed Section 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone NDTV se kaha ki chunki vah ab party ke adhyaksh nahin he isliye vah is mudde par baithak nahin bula sakate
 According to information received from the sources, the situation was not clear inside the Congress party regarding the removal of Article 370, but now it has been agreed to oppose the decision in the party
 congress ke anusaar jis tarah se is dhara ko hataaya gaya he vah tarika sahi nahin he
 Significantly, senior Congress leader Janardan Dwivedi supported the central government's move to remove Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir and divide the state into two union territories and, contrary to his party's stance, said that the government has a 'historic The mistake is' rectified
 dvivedi ne kaha ki yah rashtriya santosh kii baat he ki swatantraaa ke samay kii gai galati ko sudhara gaya he
 He said that this is a very old issue

 My political guru Ram Manohar Lohia was opposed to Article 370 from the beginning
 mere vyaktigat vichaar se to yah ek rashtriya santosh kii baat he
 It should be noted that the government abolished Article 370 to give special status to Jammu and Kashmir and the two union territories to the state

 These two goals were a witness to the pressure created by Argentina, due to which the South African team's goalkeeper remained a mute spectator in the first half at Peter Mokaba Stadium
 yunaan ne captain giorgos karagunis kii aguai main aakraamak ravaiya apanaaya lekin striker giorgos samaras unke paas ko apane kabje main lene main asafal rahe

 lara ke rahete hue carabian team ne bharat se chaar tathaa dakshin africa or srilanka se do-do match jite lekin inamen se kisi bhi match main lara ne shatak nahin lagaaya
 If this figure is fitted on Tendulkar, this star batsman witnessed 16 wins against Australia and in these matches he scored 1407 runs with the help of four centuries
 isi tarah se srilanka ke khilaaf 11 or england ke khilaaf nau maichon main mili jeet main tendulkar ne teen-teen shatak jamaaye
 He has scored a winning century against every team
 ekadivasiy antarrashtriya cricket kii baat karen to lara ke shatak jarur unki team kii jeet ke kaam main aaye

 Falgun Amavasya has sunk the Khandgrass on the Sun
 kahaan dikhegaa surya grahan?yah grahan bharat main nahin dikhaai degaa lekin aadhi duniya main dikhaai degaa
 The eclipse will be visible in the Pacific and Indian Ocean in South Africa, Namibia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, South America, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Antarctica

 How is solar eclipse? According to scientists, the eclipse of a celestial body completely or partially covered by another body is called eclipse
 surya grahan tab kaha jaataa he, jab prithvi or surya ke bich main chandramaa aa jaataa he
 Because of this, the sun cannot be seen from some parts of the earth
 jab surya purna rup se yaa aanshik rup se chandra dwaara dhak jaataa he to use surya grahan athwa aanshik surya grahan kaha jaataa hai
 There are three types of solar eclipse - full solar eclipse, partial solar eclipse and ring solar eclipse period of sunrise period - February 15 at night and on the morning of February 16, the eclipse of Khandgrass solar eclipse start - February 15 Thursday midnight 0: 25 minutes February morning -02: 24 minutes Eclipse ends February 16 morning -04: 17 minutes Be cautious due to solar eclipse - Falgun's moon moon is eclipsed

 Hence this period is considered negative
 surya se ultrawoilet kirane nikalati hai, jo anzime system ko prabhavit karti hai, isliye suryagrahan ke dauraan saavdhaanee baratane kii jarurat he
 Solar eclipse should never be seen with naked eyes
 isko dekhne ke liye vaigyanik pramanit telistcope kaa hi istemaal karnaa chahie
 Glasses that have the ability to stop ultraviolet rays can also be used to view solar eclipses
 grahan kaal main kya karen?- sutak samay ke baad swayan bhi snaan kar svachh vastra dhaaran karen, tathaa devamurtiyom ko snaan kara kar, gangaajal chhidak kar, naveen vastra pahanaakar, devon kaa shrangaar karnaa chahie
 Eclipse mantra, mantraksha, chanting, worship, recitation, havan, mental chanting, meditation in the period between the beginning and end of solar eclipse period are beneficial
 - surya grahan ke baad in tulsi or shami par bhi gangaajal chhidak inhen shuddh kiya jaataa he
 In solar eclipse, you should chant your favorite deity, mantra, guru mantra, gayatri mantra etc
 by lighting a lamp

 dilli kii 7 loksabhaa siton ke liye is baar bijepi, congress or aam aadmi party (AAP) ke bich trikoniya muqabla he
 India Today- Axis My India exit poll has predicted a win for the BJP in at least six seats
 vahiin north east dilli seat par pole ke mutabik kaante kii takkar he
 On scrutinizing the data of exit poll, some interesting facts and figures have emerged
 bijepi ne dilli main apana vot share jas kaa tas rakhaa hua he
 According to the exit poll, BJP is estimated to get 47% votes
 2014 main bijepi ko 46
 41% of the votes were received
 vahiin ‘aap’ ko 32
 9% and Congress 15
 1% vot hasil hue the
 The political equations are going to change in the capital Delhi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 agsit pole ke mutabik bijepi apane sthaan par barkaraar rahegi vahiin aap or congress ke sthaan ek-duusare se badal jaaenge
 If you look at the exit poll data, you are expected to get 17% vote share in the capital, while the Congress can regain Delhi with 30% vote share
 pole ke anumaan ke mutabik bijepi 6 se 7 siton par jeet hasil kar sakati he vahiin congress kii jeet kii sambhaavna 0-1 seat par he
 Former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit has expressed the possibility of winning the North East Delhi seat for the Congress
 vaise is seat par bhi kaante kaa muqabla he
 Here, bjp's state president Manoj Tiwari and Aam Aadmi Party's Dilip Pandey are in the fray
 raajnneetik galiyaaron main congress ke dilli main dobaaraa ubhaar ko lekar ek or bahes chhidi he
 There is a debate as to what would happen if there was an alliance between AAP and Congress in Delhi
 agar aap or congress ke vot share ko mila diya jaae to ye kareeb kareeb bijepi ke vot share ke baraabar hi baithta he
 But India Today looked at the seat-by-seat data of exit polls and found that some seats would certainly have a coalition advantage
 lekin kuch or siton par phir bhi bijepi kaa haath upar rahata
 If there was an alliance between AAP and Congress, it would have won a definite victory in Chandni Chowk and North East Delhi seats
 agsit pole ke mutabik chandani chowk seat par congress ke 36% vot share ko aap ke 15% voton se mila diya jaae to ye aankada 51% baithta
 Whereas BJP is estimated to get 43% votes on this seat
 agar north east dilli seat kii baat kii jaae to yahaan agsit pole ke mutabik congress ko 41% vot mil rahe hai
 At the same time, AAP is expected to get 11% votes
 in donon kaa jod 52% bijepi ko anumaanit milane vaale vot share 44% se kahin zyada baithta he
 Even if the alliance between AAP and Congress was on the New Delhi seat, it would be in a position of profit
 agsit pole ke mutabik is seat par congress ko 32% or aap ko 16% vot milane kaa anumaan he
 Combining the two, bjp's estimated vote share was 1% higher than 47%
 east dilli seat par congress or aap main gathbandhan hota to bhi wo bijepi se peeche rahata
 According to exit poll here, BJP is estimated to get 47% votes
 vahiin congress ko 33% or aap ko 12% vot milane kii sambhaavna he
 The addition of these two would also have been 2% less than the vote share of BJP
 dilli kii baaki teen siton par bhi agsit pole ke mutabik bijepi kii jeet aap or congress ke sambhavit gathbandhan se beasar rahati
 According to exit poll, BJP is estimated to get 53% of the vote on North West Delhi
 vahiin congress ko 21% or aap ko 20% vot milane kii sambhaavna he
 Talking about the South Delhi seat, both the AAP and the Congress are estimated to get 22–22% of the vote according to exit polls
 vahiin bijepi ko 49% vot milte dikh rahe hai
 Similarly, if AAP and Congress had contested the elections on West Delhi seat also, according to exit poll, they would have been 3% behind bjp's vote share
 bijepi ko yahaan 49% vot milane kaa anumaan he
 At the same time, AAP seems to get 21% and Congress 25%

 "tendulkar's retirement is the end of an era", Dhoni said, "it is definitely the end of an era
 ham sabhi jaanate hai ki jab unhone 1989 main cricket khelni shuru kii to main aath saal kaa tha
 "reading the game learned from Tendulkar", he said "it is difficult to tell what i learned from him
" mujhe unke saath ballebaaji kaa jitna bhi mauka mila maine khel ko padhanaa siikhaa
 Especially in odis i learned how to target the bowler and what time to do it

 In order to win the next year's assembly elections in the state, Rahul, who was pouring all his strength in the Mission 2012, met the students and youth on their two-day visit to the state, which started from January 10 last, to answer their questions
 Traveled to Allahabad, Lucknow, Jhansi and Agra
 baharhaal, samaajawaadee party (sapa), vamadal tathaa bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) samet vipakshi dalon ne rahul kaa virodh karne ke liye apane yuva kaaryakartaaon kaa istemaal kiya or vah iske jariye media kaa dhyaan khinchne main kaaphi had tak kaamyaab bhi rahe
 SP spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said that Rahul's meeting with youth is a Congress sponsored agenda
 pradesh ke noujvaan prachaar ke in hatkandon ko acchhee tarah samaj gaye hai
 They know that despite big things being done, nothing was done for them
 ’unhone aarope lagaaya ki rahul ke daure ke vakt yuvaaon kaa virodh pradarshan swaabhaavik he kyonki mahangaai, berogari or bhrashtachar kii janani congress kii nitiyon ko lekar unke andar gussa bhar chukaa he

 a large number of youths openly opposed Rahul, which shows that the magic of Congress General Secretary is not working in the state
 ’kumaar ne kaha ‘rahul ne varsh 2007 ke rajya vidhansabha chunaav or varsh 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko kamyaabi dilaane ke liye pradesh kaa daura or road sho samet tamaam tamzam kiya tha lekin tab unhen naujavaanon ke aise tikhe virodh kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa tha
 For the Congress, which is dreaming of winning the next state assembly elections, it is a clear indication of the need to look at the reality
 ’rahul ko jhaansi main mangalvaar ko bundelkhand mukti morcha ke kaaryakartaaon ke virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 When prevented from meeting Rahul, Morcha activists threw anti-slogans on his car
 is maamle main teen logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya gaya
 The opposition of the Congress General Secretary did not stop here
 dilli ke batla house cond ke baad sukhiryon main ai ulema council ke sadasyon ne bhi rahul kaa virodh kiya
 However, Congress leader Subodh Srivastava says that a handful of people have opposed Rahul to gain cheap popularity
 unhone daawa kiya ki vipakshi partiyaan pradesh ke sabhi virgo main khaskar yuvaaon main rahul ke badhate prabhaav se ghabaraai hui hai or congress mahasachiv ke daure ke vakt unhone apni chatapataahat dikhaane kii koshish kii he
 Meanwhile, political observers feel that the attitude of the opposition parties during Rahul's two-day visit ended on Tuesday made it clear that he does not want to miss the opportunity to surround Rahul on issues like inflation and corruption

 jab bhaajapa prachaar kar rahi he ki centre or rajya main ek party kii sarkaar hone se phayda milegaa, to kejariwal ise bhaajapa kii dhamkee ke rup main prachaarit kar sakate the
 And he could have challenged whether Modi could not take away the rights of any state in Delhi
 9
 They could have questioned why the Prime Minister of the country is promoting the party in a state
 kya yadi virdohi party jiti to vah vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaayega
 He could have also said to put Modi under pressure that perhaps it would have always been a stinging feeling that the city where the Lutyens are sitting, running the central government, does not have their government

 PM Modi is visiting Russia
 guuruuvaar ko vladimir putin se unki mulaakaat hui
 During this period, many agreements were reached, the most important being the S-400 defense system
 isapar deal pakki ho gai he or jald hi ye bharat ko mil saktaa he
 Explain that this defense system is capable of firing 36 missiles simultaneously
 khaskar pakistan or china se hamale kii sthiti main bharat is system kaa behatar islemal kar sakegaa
 India and Russia had been negotiating on this deal for years since the negotiations on missile defense system
 samajha ja rahaa he ki rus kii hami ke saath hi yah deal ab pakki ho gai he
 Apart from the S-400 Triumf in the defense system, what else will Russia give? During the BRICS Summit held in Goa last year, more than 32 thousand crore defense deals were done
 jiske tahat bharat rus se paanch 'S-400 anti missile dephence system' or 200 'kamov kee-226 tii' helicopter kharidega
 40 helicopters will arrive from Russia and will be built in the rest of the country
 modi ke daure ke bich rus ke uppradhanmantri dimitri rogogin ne elaan kiya he ki bharat ko vimaan bhedi missile pranali es-400 kii aapurti ko lekar pricantract taiyaariyaan jari hai
 However, he said it is difficult to say how much more time it will take
 philhal sarkaron ke bichek samjhauta haior ab ham sharton par saamaanya rup se charchaa kar rahe hai
 How does the S-400 Triumf Missile System work? Read 8 USP-S-400 Triumf, is an anti-aircraft missile
 - S-400 Triumf rus kii nai vaayu raksha missile pranali kaa hissaa he, jo 2007 main roosi sena main tainaat kii gai thi
 With these defense systems, aircraft, cruise and ballistic missiles and ground targets can also be built
 - ye misile 400 kilometre tak maar kar sakati hai
 It also has the capability to drop the F-35, America's most advanced fighter jet
 - is dephence system kii sabase badi khaasiyat yah he ki isse ek saath teen misile daagi ja sakati hai
 - From a missile to a drone, any airstrike can be easily thwarted in its presence
 - pakistan yaa china kii newclear paward belistic mixilon se bhi yah bachaayegaa
 It is a kind of missile shield
 china ko kaise denge baraabar kii takkar?china ke paas pehle se hi ye dephence system maujuud he
 But now we will also get it
 aise main ab hamen china ko takkar dene main asani hogi
 China also bought this defense system from Russia itself
 philhal china kii army iskaa istemaal karti he
 Let us know that India is also at risk of missile attacks and air strikes from Copakistan as well as from China
 isliye es-400 vaayu suraksha pranali kii bahut kaam aa sakati he

 bharat-china seemaa vivaad ko sulajhane main lag rahe samay or usamen aa rahe gatirodh ke liye bharat or uske bahudaleey pranali ko jimmedaar qaraar dete hue china ke sarkari media ne kaha ki ‘andeh or avishvaas’ ke kaaran donon paksh ek ‘santoshjanak’ samjhaute par pahunchane se ‘bahut dur’ hai or yah baat dwipaksheeya sambandhon main vikaas ko bhi baadhit kar rahe hai
 According to an article in the online edition of 'people's Daily', after last month's 15th round of border talks, there has been a good phase in bilateral relations but some inconsistencies and matters are still adversely affecting india-china bilateral relations
 
 sampadkeey panne par ek lekh ne likhaa gaya he, ‘pehla mudda china-bharat seemaa vivaad he
 China and India have held 15 meetings of experts on this issue
 baithkon ke kai saakaratmak parinaam aae hai, lekin yah abhi bhi ek santoshjanak samjhaute tak pahunchane se bahut dur he
 'it says that the main problem in this case is coming from India
 bhartiya media jor de rahaa he ki bharat or china ke bich kii seemaa ‘macmohan rekha’ honi chahie
 Also, he says that the border dispute between the two countries is not only on 90,000 square kilometers in the east, but also on the 30,000 square kilometers of the western region
 lekh ke anusaar, ‘yah galat bahes he, jisamen itihaas ko puri tarah darkinar kar diya gaya he, ab bhi bharat main iske samarthak hai
 According to this, another reason for the delay in this issue is India's multi-party system and society which is very complicated
 ’lekh ke mutabik, ‘bharat-china seemaa vivaad ke maamle main vibhinn bhartiya dalon ke vichaar alag hai, isliye, is maamle main unke liye kisi ek bindu par pahunchnaa bahut mushkil he
 'it also mentions India's concerns about the relationship between China and Pakistan
 lekh main kaha gaya he ki china-pakistan ke sambandhon ke bare main abhi bhi galatfahami he
 For most of the time since the beginning of the 21st century, the Indian government believes that China has equaled India and Pakistan
 usne aisa naa sirf pakistan ke saath sambandhon ke vikaas main kiya he balki vah bharat ke saath dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko bhi badhaava de rahaa he
 The article also said that concerns were being raised about the Gwadar Port and the Chinese Navy coming close to India and the 'nuclear technology that China is getting from Pakistan to Pakistan'
 pakistan adhikrut kashmir main china ke sainikon kii maujuudagi ko lekar bharat kii chintaa ke bare main likhaa gaya he ki pakistan main bukamp raahat kaaryon main madad ke liye china se sainikon ko bheja gaya tha

 -input bhashaa Many people feel that no one can understand them better than their best friend and that is why they start finding their partner in it
 par kya kai logon kii tarah aapako bhi ye lagata he ki best friend ko date karnaa ek behatar vikalp he? agar haa to yahaan kuch aise kaarnon kaa zikr he jiske aadhaar par ye kaha ja saktaa he ki best friend ko date karnaa shaayad ek sahi faisla nahin he
 Going on a date is an exciting experience, but going on a date with your best friend can be a surprise
 visheshgyon kii salaah he kibest friend ko date karnaa tabhi kaamyaab ho saktaa hejbaki aapkaa best friend or aap ek jaisaa sochate hon
 Otherwise, you may have differences due to different thinking
 best friend ko date karne se behatar he ki aap kisi duusare shaks ko date karen
 By doing this your friendship will always be safe
 aise main agar aapkaa koi dost aapako date par le jane kii baat kahe to aap use ye kaaran de sakate hai:1
 Isn't it strange? To date your best friend
 kya ye baat aapako kuch ajeeb nahin lagati he
 Especially during those moments
 agar aap donon lambey samay se dost hai or aapane saath main ek bahut acha vakt bitaayaa ho to un palon ke dauraan asahajata aa hi jaati he
 2
 ve aapako jarurat se zyada jaanate hanye ek bahut bada kaaran he jiske chalate sabase achche dost ko date na karne kii salaah di jaati he
 Being your best friend means that he knows you completely
 is baat se koi inkaar nahin kar saktaa he ki aap donon ke bich bahut acchhee samajhadaariviksit ho chuki hogi lekin aapke har raaj kaa wo hamraaj hoga
 In such a situation, this situation can be dangerous
 3
 The biggest disadvantage of dating a friend of distress over friendship is that doing so affects your friendship
 chijen us tarah se aage nahin bad paati hai jaisi ab tak hoti ai hai
 4
 rishta na tod paane kii majaburiya to aap koi rishta bana sakate hai yaa phir tod sakate hai
 But one of the disadvantages of dating the best friend is that you can neither break this relationship nor move forward
 5
 Looking for a new friend When you lose a very good friend, there is an emptiness in life
 jise bharne ke liye aap ekbar phir se talash shuru kar dete hai
 But it is not necessary that you get a better friend every time
