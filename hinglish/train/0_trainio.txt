 enditivi ke ratnadeep choudhary bhi lagaataar report kar rahe hai
 BBC Hindi's Priyanka Dubey reports
 aap telegraph main bhi assam kii reporting dekh sakate hai
 Then you see the reporting of your Hindi newspapers and channels
 wo kya bol rahe hai, kitna bol kar samay bhar rahe hai, un sabakaa hisaab lagaaiye, aapako pataa chalegaa ki aap yani hindi pradesh kii janata apni jeb se paisa dekar hindi media se andhera kareed rahe hai
 Great congratulations to the entire scroll team
 1985 main centre kii rajeev gandhi sarkaar or ol assam chaatr sangh(aasu) ke bich samjhauta hua tha ki 1951 main bane neshnal register aaf citijan ko apadet kiya jayega
 For this, those who came after 27 March 1971 will be shortlisted
 2010 main assam kii congress sarkaar ne payalat project kiya magar hinsa ke kaaran taal diya
 After this, in 2013, this work started on the orders of the Supreme Court and not on the initiative of the Central and State Government
 supreme court hi isaki nigaraanee kar rahaa he
 Did you get the last list which came on 31 August? The politics of Assam continued in the name of an outsider, which the BJP changed to a Bangladeshi infiltrator so that only Muslims could be targeted and Hindu Bengalis were given citizenship
 isiilie centre sarkaar naagarita sanshodhan kanoon lekar ai magar assam main mulnivaasiyon ke virodh or vidroh ko dekhte hue taal diya gaya
 Amit Shah has said that this bill is his priority
 kya wo is bill ko kashmir kii tarah raaton raat laana chahenge? yaa taalane kaa bahaanaa khojate rahenge? neshnal rigster of citision ke liye 3 karod 30 lakh ,27,661 logon ne aavedan kiya tha
 Out of this, 3,11,21,004 lakh citizens have come in the list
 maatr 6 fisadi baahar hue
 19,06,657 people are left out
 inamen kitne hindu or musalmaan hai kaha to nahin ja saktaa magar donon hai
 Confusion was spread about the National Register in the rest of India, especially in the Hindi states, that it is against Muslims
 bangladeshi ghuspaithiyon ke khilaaf he
 When the provisional list came out in July 2018, Bhojpuri residents who went to Assam from UP Bihar in lakhs were also removed
 antim suchi main bhi kai bengali hindu hai or musalmaan bhi hai
 If someone's father's name is not his mother's
 kisi kii maa kaa naam he to beti nahin
 The human tragedy is there
 aap hindi pradesh ke pathakon ko hindi media kii mukhyadhara ne gobar samaj rakhaa he
 This detail of the tragedy has been denied
 tabhi aapke bich aakar koi bhi netaa bol jaataa he ki yahaan bhi neshnal register hoga
 After reading many of the reporting of scrolls, it seems that the assumption made against Muslims about the register is not right
 isse sabhi pareshaan hue hai
 In every report you will know how such a big action is taking place
 koi anjaan aapatti kar jaataa he, log dastauez lekar pahunch rahe hai to aapatti karne vaala bhaag gaya he
 The objection is considered correct when the list is published
 asli samasya foriner tribunel ko lekar he
 Many of his decisions have been questioned
 kargil yuddh main ladane vaale samanullah ko bhi videshi ghoshit kar diya gaya tha
 Most of the decisions of this tribunal are against the Muslims
 ise lekar log zyaada ashankit hai
 The original inhabitants of Assam demanded that the land scape of their area be changed from outsiders
 unke liye bahari kaa bantwaaraa hindu yaa musalmaan ke naam par nahin tha
 His demand was against Bengali speaking, Hindi speaking and to some extent Nepali speaking
 ab bijepi isamen kuudati he or bangladeshi ghuspaithiyon kii raajnneeti le aati he taaki bina musalmaan kahe, musalamaanon ko nishaanaa banaaya ja sake
 But when the final list of registers was published, a large number of Hindu Bengalis were also left out
 mul nivasee bhi sadame main honge ki jin logon ko ve bahari samajhate rahe unamem se zyaadaatar ab sthaneey hai
 For him, both Bengali Hindus and Muslims are outsiders who have come since 1971, but have received only 19 lakhs
 usamen se bhi bengali hinduon ko centre sarkaar naagarikta de degi to bachenge hi kitne
 BJP did not say what in the name of intruders
 assam main 40 lakh ghuspaithiyaan hai
 There is talk of register in Delhi and Rajasthan also
 jaise puraa bangladesh bharat aa gaya ho
 Even if the BJP makes them citizens through the Citizenship Act, it will remain forever among the indigenous people of Assam that it has been imposed on them
 zaahir he is samasya kaa sampradayik raajnneetikaran assam ko aane vaale samay main bhi pareshaan karata rahegaa
 The scroll has all the details
 bharat ne aupchaarik rup se is masale par bangladesh se baat nahin kii he
 Foreign Minister Jaishankar went to Bangladesh before the final list of the National Register came up, he did not talk
 unhone kaha ki neshnal register aantarik maamla he
 Bangladesh has been saying that it has not been infiltrated from here
 yah uske naagarik nahin hai
 Then how will these people be sent after identification
 agar sarkaar syrius thi to bangladesh se baat kyon nahin kii
 In the same July, Home Minister Amit Shah says that according to international law, whatever is not of India will be sent to that country
 lekin bangladesh ke saath aisi koi sandhi aaj tak nahin hui
 New Detention Centers are being built
 yah dekhnaa kitna bhayaavah hoga ki is tarah ke centre main logon ko rakhaa jayega
 In the country that calls Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, it will never happen to its own people, it will never feel bad for the Hindi states whose thinking power and sensitivity has been eradicated through Hindi media and communal politics
 darasal ditension centre main agar koi he to ye hindi pradesh hai
 They are young
 jab tak hindi pradeshon ke yuva khud ko is media or raajnneeti ke ditension centre se nahin nikaalenge unke bheetar kabhi ujaalaa nahin aayega
 They will always be cursed forever
 apni sankeernata ko mahanata samajhate rahenge
 It is therefore important that young people of Hindi regions throw these newspapers from their homes
 channelon kaa conection katwa den jo unhen bogus jaankariyon ke ditension centre main rakhane kaa tantra bana chuke hai
 i also know that you cannot live without information
 koi nahin rah saktaa
 But there is no information in them
 aap in akhbaaron ko phenkege to inaki jagah acha akhbaar aayega
 Good channels will come
 andhere se nikalne kii zarurat aap naujavaanon ko he
 For good journalism, you have to get out of the habit and laziness every day
 hindi media ke is maujuuda swaroop ko thukraana hi hoga
 They will have to leave their detention center
 kal nahin, balki aaj se nikalnaa hoga aap inke kuch achche kaamon ke apwaad par mat jaaiye, us ghaav or mawaad ko dekhie jo rose ye bana rahe hai, failaa rahe hai
 Jai Hind

 An interesting incident occurred to the pilot who took charge as Minister of State for Communications for the first time at the Center while he was on a visit to Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh
 is vaakye ne unhen naukarshahi ke daavpech se nikalakar kaam karaane kaa sabak bhi sikhaa diya
 Actually, he had gone to distribute satellite phones to Border Security Force personnel
 tabhi ek jawan ne unase satellite phone lete hue kaha, ''sar thankyuu veri much
 But it costs us dearly
 ” us jawan ne jab mantri ko bataaya ki ek minute baat karne ke 50 ru
 They had to be shocked when they had to pay
 unke jehan main sawaal uthaa ki dilli main baithkar aam log ek minute ke liye chavanni dete hai or 10,000 ru
 a 50-month-old soldier posted on the border, standing in the snow and eating bullets, is paid Rs 50 to talk to his house
 prati minute dene pad rahe hai
 On coming to Delhi, the pilot ordered the officials to cut this rate
 lekin payalat bataate hai, ''adhikari file ko idhar-udhar ghumaate hue nakhre dikhaane lage
 Started saying that the Ministry of Home Affairs is not allowed
 maine fouran tatkaaleen grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram met and took written approval
 phir bhi do hafte ho gaye, adhikari kaam karke nahin de rahe the
 Sometimes they would say RTI and sometimes they would show fear of raising questions in Parliament

 kii kol dar 50 ru
 Done per minute
 ve kehete hai, ''hamaare chaar lakh ardhsainik balon ke log hai
 The call rate for all these is from April 1, 2011 to Rs 5
 prati minute kar die
 This is a small thing, but it would have been a relief to the young man who used to talk with the eyes of the clock
 ab vah 10 minute atirikt baat kar saktaa he
 The loss of the government from this is 50-60 crores
 salanaa he, lekin beasenel thodaa kam kama legaa to koi fark nahin padegaa
 Usually, the 36-year-old pilot, who wears a kurta-pajama and a half jacket in winter, has a very clear idea about the new idea
 unka maananaa he, ''yojana fail hone ke dar se pahal hi nahin karnaa acchhee baat nahin he
 a person may benefit from your work, but no one should be harmed
 ” yuva payalat ko maaloom he ki sarkari mashinari se kaise kaam liya jaataa he
 However, he is hesitant to admit that in the beginning once or twice the bureaucracy also turned them around, "we have been elected by the people, so our job is to make policy and implement the work of bureaucracy
" policy banane main jo napha-nuksaan yaa jokhim he vah meraa he
 Political people should have so much discretion as to what work is to be done
 agar aapke man main chor nahin he to phir aapako kisi cheez kii chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin hoti
 "the same thinking of Pilot has kept him immaculate in his political career so far, while in the Ministry of Communications he has accused former 2C scam accused of 2G scam
 raja ke saath bataur rajyamantri kaam kiya
 However, Pilot says on this issue, "this scam is before my time of office
 is maamle main adaalat apana nirnay karegi, lekin hamaari sarkaar ne kabhi kisi aarope par karrwai se sankoch nahin kiya
 Born in Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh and resident of Vaidpura village in Noida, Pilot has inherited politics
 pita rajesh payalat purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ke behad kareebi netaa or centre main mantri the, jabaki sachin ab congress kii ore se pradhanmantri pad ke swaabhaavik ummidavaar rahul gandhi ke vishwast hai
 However, Pilot says on the politics of inheritance, "I don't think it makes much difference who is born out of which womb, no matter how you work in your political life
" kitna aap logon ko saath lekar chal sakate hai kyonki har vyakti kisi na kisi dharm-jati se bandhaa hua he
 He has learned from his father how the ground leader should work
 payalat kehete hai, ''mere pitaaji kaha karte the ki dilli main sarkaar ne hamen yah bangala isliye diya he ki yahaan ham logon ko bithakar baat kar saken, unhen laganaa chahie ki unki baat sunne vaala koi he
 "this lesson has also been realized by Pilot in his political life
" subah 7 baje uthakar chaay kii chuskee ke saath akhbaar padhuya or 2-3 ghante aam logon se milanaa unka routine he
 They also exercise occasionally when given time
 khaane main raajma-chaaval unhen is kadar pasand he ki bachapan main ve kai baar lagaataar hafte bhar tak ise khate the
 He is not very interested in religion
 ve bataate hai, ''main bahut zyada karmkand main vishwaas nahin karata
 But if my mother does holi-diwali bhajan or worship, i definitely sit there quietly
 ” lekin payalat ko film dekhne kaa bahut shauk he
 However, here too, they do not show haste, but wait for the first week or ten days and only watch that film when it is discussed a lot
 lekin unhen ghar main baithkar film dekhnaa pasand nahin, balki jab bhi film dekhne kaa man hua payalat kisi bhi mal ke cinema haul main chale jate hai
 Apart from shooting during college, the avid pilot of badminton, cricket and football has won awards at the national level for 4-5 years
 dilli uniwarsity ke saint stephens college se grajuation or america ke wharton skool se emb karne ke baad payalat ne bibisi ke dilli beuro main kaam kiya
 After that he has also worked in General Motors for two years
 lekin 6 sitambar, 2012 ko ve apni jindagi kaa mahatvapurn kshan maanate hai jab 6-8 maheene kii kadi mehnat or pariksha ke baad unhen terrytorial army main leftinent kaa pad mila
 Pilot, who became the youngest MP in the country by becoming an MP at the age of 26, became the first Union Minister of the country that day to join the Territorial Army regularly
 ve ise apane pita kaa sapana bataate hai
 However, the wound of his father's untimely death is still green in his mind
 payalat kehete hai, ''bahut kathin samay rahaa parivaar ke liye
 The wounds are always green
 ”payalat kaa vivaah bhi rajnatik surkhiyon main rahaa tha
 In 2004, she was married to Sara, daughter of former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and current Union Minister Farooq Abdullah

 Rahul Gandhi has focused on youth leadership since taking charge of the party as Congress vice-president

" iske chalate jamini str par logon ko ri-conect karnaa taaki party logon tak jaae or log party main aa saken
 The Congress is the party of the 21st century and how the youth join themselves with the 128-year-old party, the new incarnation of this century is the thinking of Rahul ji, we will work to bring it to the youth

 Rebel MLA Sharma accused the Congress leadership of selling tickets, while Pilot was to sit in Delhi and do state politics with remote control
 baagi vidhayak ne to yahaan tak dhamkee de daali he ki june main congress kii vipaksh kii manyata tak khatm ho jaaegi
 But Pilot dismisses any factionalism in the state, "there is only one faction in the Congress and that is the sonia-rahul faction
" ham sab uske member hai
 People may have different views and this is good in democracy

 anil kapur, sonam kapur ahuja or rajkumaar raav starer film "ek ladki ko dekha to aisa laga" ke trailor or poster haal main jari hue the
 It also included the name of Bollywood veteran Rajkumar Hirani as a producer
 lekin kuch din pehle isi film kaa ek nayaa poster jari hua jisamen hiraani kaa naam nahin tha
 People questioned why his name was removed from the poster
 The answer was not available
 kaha gaya ki ho saktaa he kisi bhulvash aisa ho gaya ho
 However, the exact reason for this is now being revealed
 hiraani kaa naam poster se jaanboojhkar hataaya gaya tha
 The reason for this is due to the serious allegations of sexual harassment imposed on Hirani by a female assistant director of Sanju
 mana ja saktaa he ki khabar baahar aane se pehle hi aage ke vivaad se bachane ke liye nirmaataaon ne credit line se hiraani kaa naam hataanaa behatar samajha
 Let us tell you that when i saw a girl, it seemed that Shaily Chopra is directing
 ise hiraani ke saath vidhu vinod chopra produs kar rahe the
 Shaily is Vidhu's only sister
 jis mahila ne hiraani par aarope lagaae hai, usne kaha he ki maamla sanju ke post production ke dauraan kaa he
 The film was also with Chopra's banner
 isliye mahila ne chopra, unki patni anupama or bahan style ko hiraani kii harakat ke baar main bataa diya tha
 Rethink the way you look at love

 If this is true then why are not all the people standing outside the banks getting money
 utane kyon nahin mil rahe hai jitne wo maang rahe hai
 Rajneesh Kumar told Srinivasan Jain that keeping in mind the salary day, preparations have been made for the people standing in the line to feed them

 When asked by Srinivasan that there were reports that the Reserve Bank of India was rationing cash, Rajneesh Kumar replied that there is no such thing
 unhone mana ki ye koi saamaanya sthiti nahin he lekin utani bhi buree nahin he jitani pesh kii ja rahi he
 i am managing fifty percent of the country's money

 The Reserve Bank of India has said that no more than ten thousand can be withdrawn from the Jan Dhan account

 It has therefore been decided to impose certain limits on the operation of such accounts
 in khaaton main jinka kevaisi he wo ek maheene main das hazaar nikaal sakenge
 And those who do not have YC will be able to withdraw only five thousand
 yah faisla asthaayee taur par kiya gaya he matlab kuch samay ke liye hi he
 On the other hand, companies have started opening the accounts of their employees, so that the salary is transferred to their accounts

 It is not that this machine has come for the first time, but we have been seeing it at many shops for many years, many people were using it, but this machine, placed on the flower bed during the period of demonetisation, shows that at this time What is its importance is mashin kaa udghaatan spikar sumitra mahajan ne kiya
 This is the machine that will make the ATM unemployed one day, when people will not at least stop using cash
 cashles vyavastha main atm kaa kya kaam rah jayega
 Machines come and go in our lives

 britain or europea sangh (iyu) ke rishton ke liye faisle kii ghadi aa gai he
 Prime Minister Theresa May's proposal is to be debated and voted in the UK Parliament in an attempt to break away from the EU
 theresa me kaa prastaav sadan main paarit hota he to 29 march ko britain aadhikarik taur par sangh se baahar nikal jayega
 But if the Prime Minister's proposal fails, then there will be a very tough political challenge in front of him, where the government of Theresa May will have to start an exercise to get out of the EU once again
 faisle kii is ghadi main pradhanmantri theresa me ko dar he ki sansad main vipaksh ke saath-saath unki party ke sadsy unka saath chhod sakate hai
 Due to this fear, May last Sunday warned the mps of the party that failing in the Brexit case would be a "disgraceful and unforgivable violation of trust in democracy
" 'pradhanmantri me ke is dar kaa andaja isi se lagata he ki unhone desh ke ek pramukh akhbaar main lekh likhte hue apane saansadon se prastaav par samarthan kii apil kii thi
 May has said in his article that voting in the lower house of Parliament on his proposal related to Brexit will be the most important decision of the current generation
 darasal pradhanmantri me ko nichle sadan (house of comons) main is prastaav ko jeetna behad jaruri he kyonki yahaan haar kaa saamana karne par unhen satta ganvaane ke dar ke saath-saath iyu se alag hone ke liye nae sire se kavayad kerani hogi
 Economic experts believe that if the UK had to exit the EU without any agreement, its economy is feared to have never been compensated

 In this meeting to be held today, i have the challenge of securing the votes of most of the mps of our party along with the opposition and small political parties
 house of commenstheresa me ke prastaav par nichle sadan house of kamans main bahes hogi
 There are a total of 650 mps in the House and to get the proposal passed from them, i need the votes of at least 318 mps
 yah sthiti tab he jab irish neshanlist sinn phen party ke 7 sadsy sansad main na baithen, sadan ke 4 spikar apane matadhikaar kaa istemaal na karen or voton ko ginaney ke liye niyukt 4 saansad apane vot ko na ginen
 Debate issue The voting process will begin at 7 pm (GMT) in the British Parliament
 voting se pehle sansad main bahes kaa mudda hoga ki kya sansad ne iyu se baahar nikalne ke sarkaar ke prastaav par muhar laga di he
 Along with this, a political proposal of the government is also included in this proposal, which gives Britain the concept of a long-term relationship with the Union after its exit from the EU
 gauratlab he ki is bahes ke dauraan nichali sadan ke saansad sarkaar ke prastaav main sanshodhan kaa prastaav bhi laa sakate hai

 iske alaava bakreed, swatantraaa diwas, raksha bandhan or janmashtami ke badhai postaron main bhi kuch yahi dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 What is in the posters of Haryana Congress leaders and activists, which points to the ground reality
 darasal, in sabhi postaron se ek bade netaa kii tasviir nadaarad he
 Usually, in the posters, the leaders of the state, besides Sonia Gandhi, Rahul, Priyanka, Manmohan Singh, put a picture of the general secretary in-charge of the state somewhere
 chota kaaryakarta to rajya ke apane kareebi netaa ke saath prabharee mahasachiv kii tasviir ko jarur jagah dete hai
 Because from the ticket to the organization, the general secretary in charge has an important role
 vahiin vah party adhyaksh or rajya ke netaaon ke bich kaa pul hota he
 Although the recent posters have in-charge General Secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad absent in different parts of the state, but no one wants to talk about it openly
 alam ye he ki rajasthan se sate ilaakon main mukhyamantri ashok gahalot tak ko postaron main jagah mil gai par gulam nabi aaazaad gaayab rahe
 At the same time, a party leader said that the stand taken by Azad Saheb directly on Kashmir is against public sentiment
 haalanki, kaarysmiti ne 370 hataae jane kii baat karne ke bajaay sarkaar ke aloktantric tareeke ke istemaal par rosh jataayaa
 In such a situation, putting his picture in posters will be politically harmful
 'darasal, baat sirf haryana kii nahin he
 Earlier in the working committee meeting, Jyotiraditya Scindia, RPN Singh and Jitin Prasad have cited public opinion on this issue
 iske baad hi congress kaarysmiti ne sadhe andaaj main sidhe dhara 370 hataane ke bajaay prakriya ko galat bataate hue prastaav paas kiya tha
 Now the difficulty is that elections in Haryana are on the head and the leaders of the state are also sending a message to the high command through activist posters

 Strong Team India will go on to win a second T20 match to be played in Indore tomorrow to clinch a three-match series against Sri Lanka
 lankai team kii mushkilon kaa koi ant nahin he, jinhen katak main main 93 ranon kii karaari shikast kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 The result remained unilateral, forcing many to ask questions about how logical it is for India to play such a weak team again and again
 yah siries agle maheene main bharat ke dakshin africa ke chunauteepurn daure ke liye koi acchhee taiyaari sabit nahin hui he, kyonki gharelu team ne pasandida paristhitiyon main kamjor team ke khilaaf dabadabaa banaae rakhaa
 Indian batsmen performed well against weak attack
 ran or wicket hameshaa khilaadiyon ke aatmavishvaas ko badhaate hai, lekin sawaal yah he ki dakshin africa paristhitiyon main inkaa yah pradarshan kitna myne rakhega
 The feats of Team India in Cuttack, the absence of the greatest T20 registered captain Virat Kohli and the absence of Shikhar Dhawan and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, did not bring any relief to the Sri Lankan players who are heavily dependent on their seniors like Angelo Mathews
 srilanka ke varisht khilaadi bhartiya gendbaajon or ballebaajon kaa saamana karne main jujhate rahe, lekin indian premier lig (ipel) jaise majboot dhaanche ne mejabaanon ke liye ek acchhee bench strength taiyaar kar di he
 Rohit was happy with the victory just before Ritika's Bday, players such as WISH Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav succeeded in making a place for themselves immediately after making international appearances
 srilanka ko jarurat he ki uske captain thisara perera, upul tharanga or maithyuj udhaaharan pesh kar netritv karen
 They have been a part of the team for a long time and if they perform well, they can arouse some excitement and hope among the players
 dushmant chamira or dhananjay di silva jaise khilaadiyon ne ummid jagaai he
 India do not need their best team to dominate this Sri Lankan team, but they need to perform well
 unhen bhale hi safalataa kaa bada shrey nahin mili, lekin kamjor team ke khilaaf asafalataa nishchit rup se nakaaratmak sabit hogi
 Bravo Dhoni It has been done 24 times so far in international cricket that the role of finisher of Ajubamahendra Singh Dhoni is also being questioned for some time
 unhone katak main chauthe sthaan par bheje jane ke baad kuch ran jutaaye or unke isi sthaan par ballebaaji karne kii sambhaavna he, taaki vah dakshin africa main vanade or tii-20 chunauti se pehle match main kaaphi over khel saken
 Shreyas Iyer would also like to get some runs in the absence of Kohli and Dhawan
 lokesh rahul bhi achche form main hai
 Teams: India: Rohit Sharma (captain), Lokesh Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Dinesh Karthik, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Hardik Pandya, Washington Sundar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Deepak Hooda, Jaspreet Bumrah, Mohammad Siraj, Basil Thampi and Jaydev Unadkat
 srilanka: thisara perera (captain), upul tharanga, angelo maithyuj, kushal perera, dhanushka gunatilak, niroshan dikavela, asela gunratne, sadira samarvikrama, dasun shanaka, chaturanga di silva, sachit pathiranaa, dhananjay di silva, nuan pradeep, vishwa furnando or dushmant chamira

 ''hakeekat se munh churaati sarkaaranational centre for dijis control (encidisi) ke mutabik, rajdhani dilli main pichley saal swine flu ke 205 maamle saamne aae the
 But this year this number has crossed one thousand till 3 February
 swine flu ke maamle main rajasthan sabase aage he
 According to the Rajasthan government data, where 2,375 swine flu cases were reported in the state last year, the figure reached 2,606 by February 7 this year
 pichley saal rajasthan main jahaan 221 mautein hui thim, is baar ab tak yah aankada 91 pahunch gaya he

 In fact, in Rajasthan, it has been ordered to go door to door screening of swine flu

 Out of these, 27 thousand people have the common flu
 inamen se ek badi sankhya ko swine flu test karwaane ke liye kaha gaya he
 According to him, if the tests were not done on such a large scale, then it is not known that the cause of many deaths is swine flu

 Government's attitude also raises questions

 haalanki swasthya seva mahanideshaalay (dijiechaes), dilli sarkaar ke mutabik, 5 farvari tak dilli main ek maut ho chuki he
 But the report of government and private hospitals in Delhi is defying these figures of NCDC and Delhi government

 Says Raheja, "the reason for the sudden increase of swine flu so much is the constant fall of temperature due to repeated rains and increasing cold

 In a recent state level meeting of the Delhi government, it was claimed that all the government hospitals in the state are ready to deal with swine flu

 DGHS has also issued a helpline number round the clock
 lekin, aspataalon ke jamini halaat in daavon ko saaf taur par jhuthla rahe hai
 Doctors at a private hospital treating swine flu in Delhi say, "actually, the government is bent on denying the ground data instead of solving the problem
" ''abaki baar or khatarnaak !dow
 According to Dagar, it is not that this flu has become more dangerous this time

 That is why every year new vaccines are made to protect against this virus
 dow
 Says Dagar, "it is not, however, that one gets completely safe even after vaccination
 '' vaxin nahin lage logon kii sankhya badhati he to maamalon main vruddhi ho jaati he
 At the same time, due to changes in the strain of every virus, the resistance capacity of people is also affected

 The flu has two peak seasons — monsoon (august – October) and winter (january – March)
 taapmaana kaa girnaa virus ke liye anukool hota he, jisaki vajah se uskaa prakope bad jaataa he
 The effect is more this time because the cold has increased in February

 ujjain kii 25 varshiya hemlata maramat ne dipti colector banane ke liye kadi mehnat kii thi
 But the result of Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission State Service Preliminary Examination 2010 in August 2011 brought disappointment for them
 unka chayan mukhya pariksha ke liye nahin hua tha
 But a recent decision gave wings to his hopes again
 pariksha parinaam kii samiksha karte hue dobaaraa jo suchi banaai gai he usamen hemlata sahit 456 ummidavaaron ko praarambhik pariksha main uteern ghoshit kiya gaya he
 "I" expected all to succeed in the preliminary examination, says Hemlata
 ''ayog kii ek bhul se 456 pratibhavan yuva anuteern ho gaye the
 In fact, some objective questions asked in General Studies and Public Administration in the Preliminary Examination were incorrect while some were not included in the correct answer option
 lekin ayog ne ise nazarandaaj kar nattejey ghoshit kar die or disambar, 2011 main 4,924 parikshaarthiyon kii mukhya pariksha yojit kar lee
 On getting the information of their marks in the Right to Information and the cut off marks of preliminary examination from the Commission, many candidates found that if the questions were correct in the question paper or given the right choice of answer, they could have passed
 is aadhaar par 12 ummidavaaron ne m
 Q
 hycourt kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 The Indore bench of the High Court on 7 December ruled that the petitioning candidates should be given extra marks and if they get more marks than the cut off marks of the preliminary examination, then a separate main examination should be conducted for them
 iske baad rajya lok seva ayog ne adaalat se na sirf yachika daayar karne vaale balki sabhi ummidavaaron ko galat prashnon ke ank dete hue nai suchi banane kii anumati maangi
 In the new list which came on 5 January, 456 candidates were declared passed and decided to conduct special main examination for them on 3 February
 ayog ke sachiv dow
 Madhu Khare says, "we have followed the High Court's direction in the interest of the examinees
 ''lekin haal hi main safal ghoshit kiye gaye parikshaarthi ab bhi nuksaan main hai
 While the candidates passed in the first list got 4 months to prepare for the main examination, these candidates are not getting even one month
 nari suchi main uteern ghoshit ashok parmaar kehete hai ''pariksha kii taarikh aage badhaai jaani chahie
 "this demand is justified because a merit list will be made for the merit list of the candidates who have appeared for the main examination and are going to take the special main exam, it is clear that both were not given equal opportunities
" ayog kii karypranali par sawalia nishaan pehle bhi lagate rahe hai
 Ratlam MLA Paras Saklecha says, "the 2010 results were rectified on the direction of the court, but similar mistakes occurred in 2008 and 2009, what about their victims?" "due to the controversial rules of the Commission, men who have scored less than women who score more in other examinations have been selected for interview, the matter was raised by India Today
" sakalechaa ne is maamle main janhit yachika bhi daayar kii he jo vichaaradhin he
 He is also aware that Independent Bahubali MLA Anant Singh is going to jail from Mokama in Bihar
 jab se unke paitruk ghar se AK-47 rifl, hand grenade or 26 round goliyaan baraamad hui he tab se hi anant singh baar baar yahi kah rahe hai ki unhen saansad lalan singh ke ishaare par fansaaya gaya he or ab court se hi unhen nyaay milegaa
 There was also a raid at Anant Singh's house during Rabri Devi's tenure and there was firing from both sides for hours but in the political situation at that time Anant Singh was blessed by Nitish Kumar and Lalan Singh and he was elected on the Janata Dal United ticket
 Went
 lekin is dosti kii neenv 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan jab nitish kumaar baadh sansadeey kshetra kaa pratinidhitiv karte the to unhen is baat kaa andaaza ho gaya tha ki mokama se nirdaleey vidhayak surajbhaan singh ke lok janashakti party main shaamil ho jane ke kaaran or unhen baliya se argedy-lojpa kaa sanyukt ummidavaar banaae jane ke kaaran anant singh kii madad ke bina chunaav aasaan nahin hoga
 Hence Anant Singh was beaten up by Lalan Singh, in charge of Bahubali Management for Nitish Kumar
 us samay ek jansabha kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha jisamen chaandi ke sikkon se anant singh ne nitish kumaar ko taula tha
 This video footage of this program was also widely discussed and became a cause of trouble for Nitish Kumar
 lekin yah bhi sach he ki nitish kumaar ke satta main aate hi anant singh ke pau baarah ho gaye or unhone patna main oune-paune daamon main sampatti khareednaa shuru kar diya
 Many times the matter reached the court court and the police station but Anant Singh had the protection of power
 lalan singh ke varadahast hone ke chalate anant singh kaa kabhi bhi koi kuch bigaad nahin paaya
 Even when Jeetan Ram Manjhi became the Chief Minister soon after the last Lok Sabha election, Anant Singh used to openly use casteist statements against him
 jab lalu yadav ke saath mahagathbandhan bana or unke dabaav main kuch yadav ladakon ke saath marpet kii ghatana ke baad chhapemari hui to police team ko kuch bhi haath nahin laga or us samay ke tatkaaleen patna ke diiji shalin varisht police adheekshak vikaas vaibhav ko yah kahkar fatkaar lagaayi thi ki anant singh ke ghar par chhapemari ho or hathiyaar, kuch lakh rupee baraamad naa ho to usase badi shame kii baat nahin he
 His gesture was clear that the news of the raid had been leaked
 baad main vidhansabha chunaav main nirdaleey anand singh chunaav jite or yahi unke liye ab durgati kaa kaaran banataa ja rahaa he
 Anant Singh got the misconception that when he can win by contesting against the grand alliance of Lalu and Nitish, then why can't he become a Member of Parliament and make the mistake of challenging the same Lalan Singh in whose shadow his empire had spread Sitting
 lekin sach yahi he kii jab tak sarkaar kii krupa thi tab tak hathiyaaron kaa zakira unke patna yaa unke gaanv main rahata tha
 This was also known to the high officials of the police
 purv police adhikari amitabh laal das ne likhit rup se yah shikaayat kii thi
 But his punishment was continued throughout his career
 aaj police jo bhi karrwai anant singh ke kilaaf kar rahi he to nishchit rup se iskaa shrey mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko jaataa he jinhone ek bahubali ke kilaaf der se hi sahi karrwai karne kii himmat dikhaai
 Even though he is closely followed by Lalan Singh, who despite winning the election, transferred not one but many good officers because he did not listen to them during the election
 lekin is baat kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki anant singh ne bahubali banakar jo man main aayaa vah kiya
 Threatening the people, they continued to occupy the land and house forcibly and survived in many cases of murder, and behind all this was the patronage of Nitish Kumar and Lalan Singh
