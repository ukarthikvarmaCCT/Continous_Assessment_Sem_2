 As the controversy over the mid-night raids by Delhi Law Minister Somnath Bharti continued, three Ugandan women told the Delhi Police on Tuesday that the placement agency implicated them in a sex and drug quagmire on the pretext of getting jobs
 mahila ne police upayukta (dakshin or dakshinpurv) nila mohan ke paas shikaayat darj karai he, jisamen usne kaha he ki is tarah kii kai placement agenciyaan dilli main or aasapaas sanchalit ho rahi hai
 a police officer said that on the complaint of the women, the police have recorded the statements of the women on Tuesday after receiving an order from the Saket district court
 in teenon mahilaon ne yah bhi kaha ki somnath bharti kii chhapemari ke baad kuch logon ne un par police main maamla darj karaane kaa dabaav diya tha
 Following the complaint of these Ugandan women, the Foreign Ministry has also approached the diplomatic mission of Uganda and requested them to help these women
 isse pehle, dilli sarkaar ne is maamle main hastkshep kii maang karte hue somvaar ko videsh mantralay se sampark kiya tha, jiske baad mantralay ne yah anurodh kiya he
 a spokesman for the Ministry of External Affairs said, 'we were approached by the state government, after which we have approached the mission of Uganda to help the three women
 ' dilli sarkaar ke adhikari ke anusaar, mahilaon ne aarope lagaaya he ki 'maadak padaarth mafia' ne unke passport or anya mahatvapurn dastavej unase le liye hai
 The official said that he has sought help from the government in this matter and has arranged to send them back safely to Uganda
 supreme court ke faisle ke baad dilli sarkaar or uparajyapal anil baijal ke bich kuch muddon par to sahmati ban gai he lekir transfar-posting ke adhikaar ko lekar ab bhi takaraar jari he
 If Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal accused the Central Government and LG of disobeying the order of Supreme Court, the Home Minister has retaliated
 grih mantralay kii ore se kaha gaya he ki is maamle main koi antim raay bananakanoon ke khilaafahoga kyonki yah mudda supreme court main vichaaradhin he
 The Home Ministry said that it did not suggest the Delhi Lieutenant Governor to ignore any part of the Supreme Court order, any suggestion related to this is misleading
 mantralay kii ore se kaha gaya he ki kaha ki usne uparajyapal se kanoon kaa paalan karne ko kaha
 Adopting any final vote in matters related to services would be against the law and commenting on it would amount to contempt of court
 isse pehle dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh se milane kaa samay maanga jisase ki vah dilli main satta takaraav par supreme court ke aadesh kaa kriyanvayan sunishchit karne kaa aagrah kar saken
 Kejriwal said that it is very dangerous that the Central Government is advising the Lieutenant Governor not to follow the order of the Supreme Court on the conflict of power between the Delhi Government and the Center
 MHA has advised LG to ignore that part of SC order, which restricts lg’s powers to only 3 subjects
 v dangerous that central govt advising LG not to follow Hon'ble sc's orders

 The matter of making most of the mlas of the Progressive Democratic Front (PDF) supporting the Congress government in Uttarakhand has put the Congress in the breath
 peedief ke saat vidhayakon main teen nirdaleey, ek ukrand kaa or teen bispi ke vidhayak shaamil hai
 There was resentment among the mlas of a section of the Congress against giving ministership to five of them
 congress ke manthan shivi main bhi yahi masalaa haaavee rahaa
 Its opposition mainly includes the Congress mlas who are eager to get a place in the cabinet
 shivi kaa puraa vakt isi uhapoh main khatm hone par mukhyamantri harish ravat ne kadaa etraj jataayaa
 He also made it clear that the quota of PDF in the cabinet will not be reduced and PDF will remain with the government
 uske hatate hi sarkaar ko chah maah chalaanaa bhi mushkil ho saktaa he
 Actually Congress MLA Heera Singh Bisht, who won the last by-election, signed a letter of 15 party mlas and submitted a letter to the Union in-charge to reduce the ministers of PDF
 is par vijay bahuguna ne bhi apni sahmati di
 The PDF was bound to get annoyed as soon as this matter came to light
 unki naaraazgi ko bhaanp kar hi mukhyamantri ne is par kadaa etraj jaahir kiya or peedief ke mantriyon ko aashwast kiya ki unka saath bana rahegaa
 With the assurance of Rawat, who specializes in political betting, PDF has increased the trouble for Bahuguna by targeting him
 isse apane chaheton ko edjust karne ke liye ji-jaan se jute bahuguna bachaav kii mudra main aa gaye hai
 At the same time, Bahuguna supporters are calling it a conspiracy of Rawat, while the members of the PDF are openly praising the Chief Minister and cursing Bahuguna
 peedief cote ke paryaton mantri dinesh dhanai ne to bahuguna ko peeth main chura ghonpane vaala tak kah diya
 He said, "when Bahuguna was to become the Chief Minister, Bahuguna assured me to take the Delhi High Command along with the independents, otherwise Bahuguna would not have become the Chief Minister even in his dream
 ab mukhyamantri kii kursi ganvaa chuke bahuguna mujhe hi hatwane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 "minister of Bahuguna's comments on PDF are very painful," says Minister of State, Naithani, who became a minister from the PDF quota
 ve khud peedief kii madad se hi mukhyamantri bane the
 The PDF has become more powerful by paying tribute to the Chief Minister
 isse halkaan bahuguna ne apane bachaav main tark diya, “maine peedief ke mantriyon ko sarkaar se hataane kii maang kabhi nahin kii
 i have just spoken of removing the poorly performing ministers
 chaahe ve peedief ke hon yaa phir congress ke
 However, the Congress government, with 35 elected and one nominated mlas, touches the figure of 36 mlas in the House
 lekin ravat or bahuguna kheme main banty party main samay-samay par jis tarah kalah ho rahi he, bahumat ke aankade ko chhu lene bhar se kaam nahin chalane vaala
 In such a situation, the absence of PDF is a crisis on the government
 mukhyamantri yah baat bakhubi jaanate hai
 The Congress government is in a relaxed state with 43 members when the PDF has seven mlas
 agar peedief sarkaar kaa saath chhod detaa he to vipaksh aasaani se use jab chaahe, sankat main daal saktaa he
 Congress leaders, who are trying hard to distribute the responsibility, have also come backfoot due to the strict attitude of the Chief Minister
 mukhyamantri ne saaf kah diya he ki unhen chah maah tak khulkar kaam karne diya jaae taaki ve mishan 2017 kii raah aasaan bana saken
 At the Manthan camp, he said, "did the government return in 2007 despite distributing all the red lights in the Tiwari government in 2002? If the government was to return from the distribution of red lights and liabilities, then it would surely return
 isliye kaaryakarta dhairya rakhen
 Rawat, who took charge of state power on February 1, 2014, is making every effort to bring Congress back to power in the 2017 proposed assembly elections
 lekin bijepi bhi narendra modi kii lahar se kaaphi utsahit he
 Therefore, the Chief Minister is well aware that breaking the link with PDF may stain the Congress for being unfaithful and in the future the party may find it difficult if it needs external support
 philhal peedief ke mantri puri tarah se mukhyamantri ke niyantran main hai
 If the party's legislators were made ministers in their place, then the ministers of the PDF could be out of their control
 vahiin vijay bahuguna mukhyamantri kii kursi chhin jane ke baad se hi apane samarthakon ko ekajute rakhane main asahaay najar aa rahe hai
 Two PDF ministers from Tehri, considered his parliamentary seat, are also threatening him
 tehri se nirdaleey vidhayak dinesh dhanai or yamunotri se ukrand ke vidhayak preetam singh panvar kii badhati takat bahuguna kii neend haraam kar rahi he
 In the last Lok Sabha elections, both the mlas did not work for their son Saket Bahuguna, losing them by heavy votes
 jab ravat bahuguna kii jagah mukhyamantri bane to us vakt bhi peedief ko ekajute rakhane or ravat ke paksh main aane main dhanai ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 At that time, Bahuguna was told that his supporters would get the speaker, state president and Rajya Sabha seats but got nothing
 ab to unki rahi-sahi saakh bhi mushkil main he
 Congress state president Kishore Upadhyay is also concerned about his traditional Tehri seat
 2012 kaa vidhansabha chunaav ve vahaan dhanai se hi haar gaye the
 Now, as soon as Dhanai becomes a minister, he is seen moving his land
 isi vajah se ve bhi peedief ke cote ko kam karne ke sur main sur milaate hue bahuguna ke kareeb aane lage the
 But seeing the stern attitude of the Chief Minister, he also suddenly saw a change
 unka kahana tha, “meri chintaa nirdaleey or anya peedief ke sadasyon kii siton par congress sanghathan kii majbootee ko lekar thi
 That is why i wanted the ministers of the PDF to stop ignoring the Congress
 ” congressiyon kii upeksha ko lekar mukhyamantri ne peedief ke mantriyon ko saaf kaha he ki ve congress kaaryakartaaon kii ore se uthaai ja rahi janhit kii maangon ko bhi mil-julkar puraa karen
 Rawat has made his impact felt by snatching the ministerial post of Ramnagar MLA Amrita Rawat and replacing him with a PDF quota
 bahuguna kii lakh koshish ke baavjood rajyasabha seat par apni pasand kii manorama sharma ko tikat dekar bhi ravat ne unhen patkhni de di thi
 He also took his own favorite Kishore Upadhyay to the post of state president
 ab peedief mudde par bahuguna ko phir se munh kii khaani padi he
 Bahuguna camp is dead at the moment, but the uproar over the PDF has definitely brought the internal infighting of the Congress to the surface
 yah uske liye chintaa kii baat to he hi
 This issue has also made it clear that the Rawat faction is becoming stronger day by day in a party divided between the Rawat and Bahuguna factions

 mumbai police is video ko internet se tatkaal hatwanaa chaahati he or isliye unhone google ko ek letters likh kar Orkut seise ko hataaneco kaha he

 a Mumbai Police spokesperson said, 'we have written to Google and youtube Administration to block this disputed video from their social networking website Orkut

 Wife of famous Bhojpuri singer Pawan Singh commits suicide Book Review: Talaash Bhojpuri linguistic identity bhoomi adhigrahan ko lekar badaae vivaad ke bich sarkaar ne shuukravaar ko ek nae bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak kaa masauda pesh kiya, jisamen bhoomi maalikon ko paryaapt muaavja dene or visthapiton kaa punarvaas sunishchit karne ke uddeshy se paardarshee kanoonee ruparekha taiyaar kii gai he
 The draft of the much awaited National Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill, 2011 states that in the case of urban areas the compensation amount shall not be less than twice the market value, while in rural areas it shall not be less than six times the market value
 vidheyak ke masaude main prastaav kiya gaya he ki agar sarkaar rashtriya rajmarg ke alaava saarvajanik uddeshy yaa pipipi pariyojnaon ke liye nijee companiyon ke istemaal ke vaaste bhoomi kaa adhigrahan karti he, to pariyojna se prabhavit 80 pratishat pariwaron kii sahmati leni anivaary hogi
 The draft also states that the public work that will be mentioned will not be changed later
 masaude main suzav diya gaya he ki kisi bhi paristhiti main bahu-fasalon, sinchai vaali bhoomi kaa adhigrahan nahin kiya jayega
 Most of such lands are situated in the Gangetic plain of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar
 saath hi sarkaar nijee uddeshy ke liye nijee companiyon kii ore se bhoomi kaa adhigrahan nahin karegi
 Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh said that the market of land in India is quite flawed
 masaude kii prastaavna main likhaa gaya he ki jo bhoomi kaa adhigrahan karnaa chaahate hai or jinaki bhoomi kaa adhigrahan kiya ja rahaa he, unke adhikaar evam soochnaaon ke maamle main baari asantulan he
 This is the reason why the government has to play a role in implementing transparent and flexible rules so that it can be implemented
 vidheyak ke masaude main sarkaar ko desh kii raksha evam suraksha ke maamalon main bhoomi kaa adhigrahan karne ke liye apaat niyam lagu karne ke liye adhikrut karne kaa prastaav he
 In the event of emergency or natural calamities, the government will be able to meet the needs of restoration and rehabilitation and in some rare cases acquire land
 vidheyak ke masaude kii visheshtaon main bhoomi maalikon evam roji-roti kaa saadhan ganvaane vaale logon ke liye ek vyapak punarvaas package shaamil he
 These include those who depend on the land being acquired for livelihood
 masaude main 12 maheene ke liye prati maah prati parivaar 3,000 rupee or 20 saal ke liye prati parivaar 2,000 rupee pension suvidha kaa prastaav shaamil he
 Also, it is mandatory to provide employment to a member of the family and to provide two lakh rupees if employment and other incentives are not offered
 bhoomi maalikon ke liye masaude main yah praavdhaan bhi kiya gaya he ki agar bhoomi maalik kii jameen kaa adhigrahan sinchai pariyojna ke liye kiya gaya he, to prayek parivaar ke liye pariyojna kshetra main ek acre bhoomi uplabdh karai jaae
 In case of land acquisition for urbanization, 20 percent of the developed land will be reserved and will be offered to the owners in proportion to the land acquired
 vahiin duusari ore, agar adivasee kii bhoomi kaa adhigrahan kiya jaataa he to prayek pariyojna main prayek anusuchit janajati parivaar ko ek acre bhoomi di jaani chahie
 It also states that families whose land is being acquired should be given a one-time financial assistance of Rs 50,000
 ramesh ne kaha ki bhoomi adhigrahan evam punarvaas va punarsthapana ko ek vidheyak main shaamil kiya gaya he, kyonki ye ek sikke ke do pahalu hai
 The inclusion of these was recommended by the National Advisory Council headed by Sonia Gandhi
 bharat duniya main avaidh cigarette kii chhathi badi mandi ban gaya he
 According to an estimate, it has a turnover of around Rs 2000 crore in the country
 asocham dwaara karaae gaye surveykshan main kaha gaya he ki avaidh cigarette ke kaarobaar se jahaan ek taraf sarkaar ko rajasav kii kshati hoti he, vahiin kareeb 50 lakh tambaakoo utpaadak kisaanon kii roji-roti prabhavit hoti he
 The study has raised doubts that the income from this business is also used to provide financial assistance to the terrorists
 nami anusandhan sanghathan euromonitor ne haal hi main kiye gaye apane adhyayan main kaha he ki aise cigarette utpaada kar, waite, seemaa shulk yaa anya karon kaa bhugtan nahin karte, isliye saste or aakarshak mulya par uplabdh hote hai
 109 billion cigarettes were produced in the year 2006–7
 2010-11 main yah sankhya ghatakar kareeb 101 arab rah gai
 Euromonitor forecasts the size of the illegal cigarette business in India to grow further
 adhyayan ke mutabik bharat main avaidh cigarette kaa prativarsh kareeb 2000 rupye kaa karobaar hota he
 Such cigarettes do not use tobacco produced in India, which has already threatened the livelihood of tobacco farmers of the country facing adverse conditions
 avaidh cigarette kii samasya khaas taur se shahari kshetra main gambhir he, lekin puraa desh isaki jad main aa chukaa he
 The most important is that cigarettes coming through smuggling are also not compulsorily provided with a warning warning under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (kotpa), which also shows the government's tobacco control policy is in a shambles
 aisi cigarette ke dibbon par khudara bikri mulya nahin hone se taskaron or bazaar main iskaa karobaar karne waalon ko acchhee aamadani hoti he
 In the Indian market, such cigarettes are smuggled from China, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Gulf countries, South East Asian countries and even European countries

 At the Entrepreneur Summit of Delhi Aaj Tak, many people were invited who started work at their level and after achieving success they joined social work
 dilli se jude aise hi ek shaks kaa naam he sanjay gupta jinhone vigyaapan kii duniya main kamyaabi hasil kii or phir saamaajik kaaryon main rahete hue ab raajnneeti kii duniya main kamyaabi kaa swaad chakhnaa chaahate hai
 Sanjay Gupta, owner of NG Aids and Social Workers, said that in 2002, he ventured into the world of business and after achieving success for a decade, thought of doing social service and helped people in many cases
 sanjay gupta ne kaha ki aapke channel kii sabase khaasiyat yah he ki aapako jab lagata he ki kuch aisi chijen ho rahi hai jise dikhaanaa jaruri he to aapkaa channel dikhaata he
 At the Entrepreneur Summit of Delhi Aaj Tak, he said, 'initially i thought that i would go into the world of advertising to earn more money
 naukari ke dauraan kai vibhaagon main rahane ke dauraan bijness shuru karne ko lekar koi vichaar nahin tha, lekin baad main jab vigyaapan vibhaag main aayaa to laga ki bijness shuru kiya ja saktaa he
 'an example of an officer Sanjay Gupta while speaking about the honesty of one of his senior tax officers at the Entrepreneur Summit of Delhi Aaj Tak, said that he did not let anything go wrong and did something that the front would force him to do it right Tax had to be paid
 unhone udhaaharan dete hue bataaya ki ek baar ek company ne car par vigyaapan ke liye parmishan maangi, lekin usne 200 car kii parmishan lee or apane 1200 kaaron par vigyaapan laga diya
 At that, the officer gave a notice to that company to advertise 5000 cars and asked to pay a fine for it
 is par company ne kaha ki uske paas to 1200 kaaren hai 5000 car nahin hai
 Then the officer asked him to pay advertisement tax on 1200 cars
 is tarah se unhone bina kuch kiye hi usase puraa hisaab vasuul liya
 After going to social service, he said that he has only one objective to meet Modi ji (narendra Modi), now let's see when my wish is fulfilled, the social work that has been done till now is right The way forward

 kendriya doorsanchaar or rail rajyamantri manoj sinha shuukravaar ko ek sadak durghatana main ghayal ho gaye
 This incident happened when he was returning to Gorakhpur from the bjp's ongoing Parivartan Yatra in Barabanki
 haadasa gorakhpur ke nausadh main rajghat pul par apni hi scot kii gaadi se takkaraane se hua, unke baayen haath or pair main maamuli chot lagi he
 According to the information received, their own vehicles collided with the police station of Gorakhpur due to braking
 khabaron kii maane to ek rahgeer ko bachaane main achaanak brake lagane se ye haadasa hua
 And Manoj Sinha was injured
 unke haath main fracture kii soochna mil rahi he, lekin wo khatre se baahar hai
 Manoj Sinha was rushed to the Apollo Hospital in Gorakhpur after complaining of hand pain
 jahaan unka praathmik upachaar kiya gaya
 According to doctors, the minister has suffered minor injuries and is out of danger
 bhaajapa ke khilaaf 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main vipakshi ekajutata kii sambhaavna jharkhand main sabase adhik he
 The BJP leadership is also understanding this very well
 amit shah 11 july ko rajya ke daure par gaye or vahaan sanghathan kii majbootee or siyaasi sameekaran ko lekar party padaadhikariyon se feedback bhi liya
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won 12 out of 14 seats here
 jharkhand mukti morcha (jhamumo) sirf 2 seat hi jeet sakaa tha
 The BJP emerged as the single largest party in the assembly elections and formed a government with allies
 lekin pichley chaar saal main sthitiyaan badal gai hai
 The opposition JMM is raising the issue of non-tribal chief minister seriously, which also has the silent support of the tribal mlas and workers of the BJP
 bhaajapa ke purv mukhyamantri arjuna munda haashie par hai
 This has had an impact on the party's solidarity
 mob linching, bhukhmaree se maut jaise mudde vahaan kii raghubar das sarkaar ke liye pareshaani kii badi vajah ban gaye hai
 The issue of Pathalgadi is even more serious
 lekin bhaajapa kii asli chintaa virdohi dalon kii sambhavit ekajutata he
 JMM has announced to go with Congress
 saath hi basapa, rajd or jharkhand vikaas morcha (jhavimo) jaise dal bhi bhaajapa ke khilaaf ekajute ho gaye to 2019 main jharkhand main bhaajapa kii chunavi sambhaavnaaen dhoomil bhi ho sakati hai
 The Congress is theoretically ready to make itself the junior partner of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha in Jharkhand to stop Siyasamodi of Congress in 2019
 congress sutron ke mutabik, jhamumo ke har mudde par rajya main congress har tarah se samarthan dene ko taiyaar he
 In particular, Congress will give air to the talk of neglect and abuses of tribal people
 rajya main adivasee mukhyamantri kii jhamumo kii maang ko bhi congress khule taur par samarthan dene kaa vichaar kar rahi he
 Congress leaders are trying to get Babulal Marandi together
 yahaan jhamumo, congress, rajd, jhavimo is koshish main hai ki ajasu ko apane paale main kiya jaae
 There is also a plan to invite Yashwant Sinha, the state's tall leader and former finance and foreign minister, for discussion on behalf of the intellectual and economic institution associated with anti-bjp parties to discuss the policies of the Narendra Modi government and the flaws of the Jharkhand government in the intellectual section
 An important issue should be made

 Input: IANS aisa mana ja rahaa he ki pakistan main purv siie stesan chif mark kelton ko iesai ne jehar diya tha
 Former CIA chief Mark Kelton led the raid in May 2011 in which Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden was killed
 mark kelton ko abtabad main bin laden ke thikaanon par chhapemari ke do maheene ke baad swasthya sambandhi pareshaani ke chalate islamabad se hataaya gaya tha
 His health had deteriorated at that time
 bin laden ko khatm karne vaale oparation ke baad unka naam achaanak surkhiyon main aa gaya tha
 a special investigative report by the 'washington Post' reported that Mark Kelton is retired from the CIA and his health has improved since his abdominal surgery

 He said that he was not the first person who suspected that he was poisoned

 unhone baithak main kashmir main ho rahi hinsa par dukh bhi jataayaa he
 Sharif said that Pakistan opposes any such violence, their sympathy is with the people there
 sharif ne baithak main kaha ki bharat sindhu jal samjhaute se kisi bhi tarah alag nahin ho saktaa
 If India expresses any opposition to this agreement, Pakistan will make a request to the World Bank

 a message on a whatsapp group of BJP workers said: "A timely warning

 This year, questions are being raised within the entire party after the bjp's poor performance in the bypolls held in its strong fort of Hindipatti
 janvari main party rajasthan main ajmer or alvar kii loksabhaa siten or mandalgarh vidhansabha seat haar gai
 On the 1st of March, she lost the assembly seats of Mungavali and Kolaras in Madhya Pradesh
 to 14 march ko uttar pradesh or bihar kii teen loksabhaa siton par bhi khet rahi
 Due to these defeats, the party's seats in the Lok Sabha fell from 282 in 2014 to 274
 or uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party jis apratyaashit dhang se ek-duusare ke saath ai hai, use dekhakar lagata he ki ekajute vipaksh 2019 main party ke liye chunauti khadi kar saktaa he
 There was concern and precaution in the atmosphere of the party parliamentary party meeting held on 23 March at the new BJP headquarters on Deendayal Upadhyay Marg in New Delhi
 pradhanmantri modi, party pramukh amit shah or 300 se zyada saansad is baithak main maujuud the
 Addressing the mps, both Modi and Shah gave a message to take the good works of the government home
 magar party ke bheetar us sabko lekar khusfusaahaten shuru ho gai hai jise in dinon bhaajapa kii sabase badi aantarik dikkat kaha ja rahaa haih party main salaah-mashvire kaa kam se kamatar hote janaa
 This is believed to be the result of the collapse of the old systems of institutional communication
 12 may ko karnataka ke chunaav congress ke liye to ubaarane yaa dubone vaale honge hi—agar vah vahaan haar jaati he, to uski jholii main mahaj ek hi ahm rajya punjab rah jayega—magar bhaajapa bhi vahaan koi aaramdaayak sthiti main nahin he, baavjood iske ki rajya main aresas kaa majboot network he
 The party has B
 in Karnataka
 es
 From Yeddyurappa to Ananth Kumar and B
 santosh tak kai netaa hai jo aapas main jutampazar karte rahete hai
 When the modi-shah duo captured the national flag in 2014, their roles were clearly set
 modi jahaan sarkaar chalaa rahe the, vahiin shah ne party ko nae sire se khadaa kiya or uskaa vistaar kiya
 Gradually, their roles continued to grow in their respective circles
 modi sarkaar kaa cheharaa or shah party ke bheetar aisi akeli aawaaj ban gaye, jo keval or keval modi ke prati javabdeh thi
 Leaders say that this system confined around just two people - at least within the party - is now hurting
 vaajapeyi ke jamaane main party ke kaam karne kaa tarika dekh chuke majhule str ke ek party netaa naam ujagar na karne kii shart par kehete hai, "party main ekatarfa samvaad rah gaya he
 As a result, Jihujur is able to reach the summit
 isse un do netaaon tak sahi jaankariyaan nahin pahunch paa rahi hai jo party main tamaam faisle le rahe hai
 Initial signs emerged during the Gujarat elections in December
 yah chunaav party bamushkil jeet saki thi
 The activists were upset and were constantly giving feedback that the BJP has started appearing arrogant and crooked and there is a need to present a more humble image of the party
 iske baavjood party alaakaman ke kaanon par jun tak na rengi
 He paid the price for it
 agar partijanon kii salaah suni hoti, to bhaajapa aasaani se kam se kam 10 or siten jeet sakati thi
 It is this attitude that is also affecting relationships with allies in the National Democratic Alliance
 apane dam par spasht bahumat hasil karke or sarkaar ke vajood ke liye sahyogi dalon par nirbhar na rahakar party unhen nazarandaaj karti jaan padati he
 Not a single meeting of the NDA has been called in the last three years, nor has there been any convenor of the alliance since 2013
 chandrababu naidu kii tedepa pehali party thi jisane andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene ke mudde par 17 march ko rishte tod liye
 He had been continuously complaining that his state was being ignored since the separation of Telangana
 magar bhaajapa ne unke muddon se mukhaatib hone yaa unase baat karne kaa koi jatan nahin kiya
 The reality is that it was even harder for Naidu to meet the Prime Minister
 iske bajaae bhaajapa kahati rahi ki unhen kaaphi rakam di gai he, par vishesh rajya ke darje kaa unase kabhi vaada hi nahin kiya gaya tha
 Therefore, in successive defeats in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, the Chief Minister of Andhra broke the opportunity and broke the relationship
 bhaajapa kii sabase puraani sahyogi partiyaan shivasena or akali dal bhi khush nahin hai
 Angered by the bjp's lack of consultation, the Shiv Sena has almost broken relations
 ve us cheez se bhi agbabula hai jise ve uske netritv kii magarooriyat or apane upar gairavaazib rob ganthne kaa ravaiya kehete hai
 However, the reasons behind the unhappiness of other allies are what the party calls their "separate and non-traditional" demands and which the government committed to transparency cannot fulfill
 magar kuch duusari maangen to vah beshak puri kar hi sakati he
 The same attitude of behavior is piercing others within the party as well
 party ko in varshon main badhata dekhte aa rahe ek netaa kehete hai, "donon sheersh netaaon ke paas vakt kii bahut maaraa-maari he kyonki ve sarkaar chalaane or party ko badhaane main duube hue hai
 Apart from this, they have become accustomed to obeying their orders
 lihaaja unke paas salaah-mashvire kii zyada gunjaaish hi nahin he
 Unfortunately, this style of working is also becoming the identity of other lower level leaders, which is dangerous
 '' is kism ke andeshe lagaataar bad rahe hai, khaskar jab party is saal karnataka ke baad rajasthan (jahaan vah paanch saal se satta main he) or madhya pradesh tathaa chhattisgarh (jahaan 2003 se satta main he) sareekhe rajyon main ek ke baad ek chunaavon main utregi
 a party worker who has held many important positions says, "ninety percent of the damage is happening because of the party's image that it has become arrogant and crooked
" agar ham is chhavi ko sudhaar len to chijen badal sakati hai
 If we lose the battle of perception among the people, then understand, we also lost a much bigger game
 phir hamaari sarkaar chaahe kitna bhi acha kaam kyon na kare
 These activists say they are proud of the clean image of the Modi government, its efforts to fight corruption and its expansion in the north-east, but they do not understand that the party to include defectors and maligned leaders of the opposition Why is he so hasty? udhar party ke aalaa netaa safai main kehete hai ki aisa isliye kiya ja rahaa he, kyonki bhaajapa ko baahar se netaaon ko laakar party kaa jati aadhaar majboot karne kii jarurat he
 When the party awarded former Maharashtra Chief Minister Narayan Rane a Rajya Sabha ticket, eyebrows were raised within the party
 purv shiv sainik or baad main congressi rahe rane bhrashtachar ke aaropon se ghire hai or 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main buree tarah haare the
 Worse is the case of Samajwadi Party leader Naresh Agarwal, who was happily taken to the party after leaving the Samajwadi Party due to a Rajya Sabha ticket being cut
 bhaajapa ke ek netaa kehete hai, ye vahi agarwal hai jinhen kattar muslim voton kii garaj se pakistan samarthak bayaan dene se bhi kabhi gurej nahin rahaa
 Some party leaders believe that some heavy promises of BJP are also responsible for the dissatisfaction
 saal 2022 tak sabhi ke liye makaan kaa sarkaar kaa vaada gramin ilaakon main to puraa hota dikhaai de rahaa he, par shahari ilaakon main ladkadaa rahaa he jahaan jameen kii kami kii vajah se rakrataar dhimi pad gai he
 Then there is the agrarian crisis, although the government is hoping to solve it with the new policy of minimum support price to be announced soon
 magar yah madhyam varg kaa asantosh hi he jo bhaajapa ke liye sabase badi chunauti sabit ho rahaa he
 Certain sections of the party are of the opinion that despite gaining tremendous support from the middle class, the BJP has abandoned it
 yah madhyam varg hi tha jisane modi sarkaar kii notebandi kaa or phir jiesti kaa samarthan kiya tha, to bhi use 2018-19 ke bajet main kuch nahin mila
 There is another aspect to it
 modi sarkaar hukumat ke chaar saal baad bhi logon kii najar main kisi bhi ghotaale se bedaag bani hui he
 Asked about Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi, party president Amit Shah says that these are exceptions and do not include any big party leader, as used to be in the UPA scandals (see conversation)
 sarkaar ke khilaaf logon main bade paimaane par koi bechaini nahin he or yahi vajah he ki lokapal or kisaanon ke liye insaaf ke haq main pichley hakrate nai dilli main hui anna hajaare kii raily main bahut kam log aae
 BJP General Secretary Anil Jain says, "the ruthlessness of the people that Anna Hazare shows clearly shows how popular the Modi government is among the people
" ''shah yah bhi kehete hai ki in paraajayon ko bahut zyada tool di ja rahi he or inaki vajahon kii shinaakht karne ke baad party sudhaar ke kadam uthaaegi
 a meeting of BJP leaders is scheduled to take place soon, in which consideration will be given to the handling of allies of the NDA
 magar usase pehle shah or modi donon ko apane ravaie or saath-saath apni kaaryastylee main badlaav laana hoga or usamen zyada salaah-mashvire ko shaamil karnaa hoga
 They will have to bring some more intense leaders around them and entrust them with the responsibility of handling NDA allies
 padmashri se navaaje gaye, aresas kii prishthbhumi se aae lekhak vishnu pandya, jinhone modi or shah kaa siyaasi ubhaar dekha he, ek or dilachasp baat kii taraf ishaara karte haih "party puraane ilaakon ko banaae nahin rakh paa rahi he, jabaki uttar-purv sareekhe nae-nae ilaakon main uskaa vijay abhiyaan jari he
 Some of the reasons for losing its won old areas could be that the party's state governments have not been able to walk with the vision of the central government
 or isaki kuch vajah yah dharna bhi ho sakati he ki centre sarkaar apane vaade puure nahin kar paa rahi he
 It is clear that apart from gearing up for 2019, the party will have to do a lot more
 kaaryastylee main amulchul badlaav se kamatar kisi cheez se kaam nahin chalegaa

 The Panchayat argues that such a sentence will not recur
 tyoharon ke mausam main airline companiyaan hawaii safar ke kiraye badha detii hai
 In case of emergency, you have to loose pockets more in the name of fare even if you have to travel by air
 ‘demand and supplai’ kaa hawala dekar airline companiyaan yatriyon se adhik se adhik munafa batorne kii koshish main rahati hai
 In such a situation, seeing the high air fares, many times passengers have to postpone the journey or choose to travel by train
 darasal, desh main uddyan kshetra kaa jaise-jaise dayera badhata ja rahaa he, chote shahar bhi hawaii nakshe se judate ja rahe hai, vaise-vaise airline companiyon ko lekar logon kii shikaayatein badhati ja rahi hai
 The Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Ministry of Transport and Tourism has taken cognizance of this behavior of airline companies
 tiemasi ke rajya sabha saansad derek o broin kii adhyakshata vaali samiti ne hawaii kiraayon ko lekar airline companiyon kii manamaani par lagaam lagane ke liye sarkaar se hawaii tikaton ke adhiktam daam kii seemaa tay karne kii sifarish kii he

 samiti ke mutabik "tyoharon ke mausam main yaa yatra kii tarikh se najadik tikat kii booking karwaane par airline companiyaan kai baar saamaanya kiraye se das guna zyaada kiraaya vasuulati hai
 This is arbitrary and unacceptable
 "samiti kaa kahana he ki airline companiyon ko yatriyon ke is tarah shoshan kii ijazat nahin di ja sakati he
 Hence the maximum fare limit should be fixed
 samiti ne is maamle main naagarik uddyan mantralay kii bhi aalochana kii he
 According to the committee, despite knowing everything, the ministry is not taking any active steps in this matter
 airline karmchaariyon ke vyavhaar par chintaa jatipichley dinon airline companiyon ke karmchaariyon kii ore se yatriyon se badasluki or marpet jaisi kai ghatnaayen saamne ai hai
 The committee has also shown concern and resentment over such incidents
 airlinecompany indigo kaa naam lekar samiti ne apni report main kadi tippanee karte hue company ke ground stoff or cabin kru ko apane vyavhaar main parivartan laane kii hidaayat di he
 During the meetings of the committee, several members voiced their objections, claiming that the airline staff treat passengers as 'uneducated' and even 'animals'
 samiti ne aagaah kiya he ki airline companiyon ke karmchaariyon ko is tarah ke bartaav se baj aana chahie
 The committee suggested that airline companies should arrange such training for all their employees to make them more sensitive to passengers
 samiti kii ek baithak main pesh hue naagarik uddyan mantralay ke sachiv ne sadasyon ko bharosa dilaayaa ki aise maamalon main turant kadam uthaae ja rahe hai
 The Secretary said that the airline employees who are found involved in such activities will not be allowed to enter any airport in the country as an employee

 Delay at check in counters is one of them
 aise aarope saamne aae ki airporton par check-in kii prakriyaan lambii or kshtprad hoti hai
 The committee found the condition of check-in counters of low-rent companies particularly messy
 samiti kaa yahaan tak kahana he ki in countaron par jaanboojhkar lambii lambii line lagaai jaati hai taaki yatriyon ko saamaanon ke check in main kaafii samay lage jisase ki unki flite chhot jaae or wo agali flite ke liye mahangi tikat lene ko majaboor ho saken
 To avoid such a situation, the committee has instructed all airline companies and the government to make such an arrangement that a passenger has to stop at the check-in counter for at least 10 minutes
 iske liye airline companiyon ko paryaapt sankhya main karmchaaree rakhane ke liye kaha gaya he
 Why is the cancellation of tickets so expensive? The committee has also taken cognizance of collection of arbitrary charges by the airline companies for cancellation of tickets in case of non-travel
 samiti ne tikat radd karne kaa charge tikat ke mul yani base kiraye kaa adhiktam 50% tay karne kii sifaarish kii he
 The committee has also suggested that the tax and fuel surcharge included in the ticket fare should be returned to the passengers

 On the report of the committee on fares, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha has said that these international rules are decided according to the laws
 unhone or deshon kii tulana main bharat main hawaii kiraayon ko kam bataaya
 Rajeev Shukla, a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport and Tourism, said that while air fares start to skyrocket during festivals or holidays, the government should put in place a regulatory mechanism to curb the arbitrariness of airline companies
 isi samiti ke ek or sadasypappu yadavane kaha ki samiti sarkaar ko sifarish kar bhi de to wo maani jane vaali kahaan hai

 For the first time after the formation of the SP government in UP, the Congress expressed its anger against the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) for opposing the Central Government's ambitious and public welfare scheme, the Food Security Act 'right to Food' in the state

 afjal guru ke parivaar ne aupchaarik taur par chitthee likhakar tihaad jail adhikariyon se shav saunpe jane kii maang kii he, taaki ve use kashmir le ja sake
 On behalf of the family, Afzal's counsel ND Pancholi and Nandita Haksar have written a letter to the Director General of Tihar, Vimala Mehra and also said that when he (family) comes to Delhi, he would like to read Fatiha on his grave
 patr main kaha gaya he ki shav ko kashmir le jane ke liye ve apni ore se prakriya shuru karen
 Condemning the 'leaking' information about Afzal's belongings by the jail authorities, the lawyers have said that the family wants to keep the belongings attached to them
 chitthee main kaha gaya he ki ek suchi banane ke baad afjal se judi hui vastuon ko surakshit jagah par rakh dena chahie, taaki use afjal ke vakeelon ko saunpa ja sake
 The lawyers said that the family was upset because there was no response from the jail authorities on the demand to read Fatiha at Afzal's grave
 grih sachiv aarake singh ne kaha he ki parivaar ko tihaad jail parisar main uski kabr par fatiha padhane kii anumati di jaaegi
 Meanwhile, according to a report from Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Mahadakpal Jan Samyul has said that Afzal's last letter was handed over to the family at Sopore in North Kashmir
 gujarat main rajyasabha kii teen siton ke liye hue chunaav main bijepi ne do siton par kabja kar liya
 However, the most discussed here is the victory of Congress 'chanakya' Ahmed Patel on the third seat
 rajyasabha chunaav kii voting ke baad mangalvaar ko kareeb10 ghante ke hai-voltage drameke baad nattejey saamne aae, jisamen bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or kendriya mantri smriti irani ko 46-46 vot mili, vahiin ahamed patel ne 44 voton ke saath jeet darj kii
 In the 176-member state assembly, the victory figure was 43 after the cancellation of votes of 2 Congress mlas
 51 pahunch gaya
 In such a situation, even though the difference of Patel's victory may be slight, but if we look at the politics of the state, it matters
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke raajnneetik salaahkarahamad patelko haraane ke liye amit shah and company kii taraf se behad aakraamak taiyaari dikhi
 There was a time that Amit Shah is determined to defeat Patel
 vahiin congress ne bhi un par apane vidhayakon ko digane ke liye har tarah kesam, daam, dand, bhejpanaane ke aarope lagaae
 In such a situation, after the election results, one thing is clear: Congress emerged as the winner in these battles
 gujarat main is saal ke ant main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 For this reason, there was a lot of uproar this time in the Rajya Sabha election, which is usually settled without any noise
 yahaan raajnneetik jaankaar amit shah kii in sari kavayad ko rajya main chunaav se pehle congress par manovaigyanik badhat banane kii thi
 However, the Congress emerged victorious in this battle, which for him is like Sanjeevani
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah bhi he ki gujarat ke kaddavar netaaon main shankarasingh waghela ne rajyasabha chunaav se thik pehle congress kaa daaman chhod diya
 At the time of Vaghela's announcement, the Congress did not give it much priority and said that there will be no significant loss to the party due to his departure
 haalanki in chunaavon main congress ke andar machi foot ne party ko waghela camp kii shakti kaa vakt rahete ehsaas kara diya
 In such a situation, the party will now have time to make up for this loss
 darasal congress is baar rajya main patidaaron, daliton or duusare pichde tabakon ke bheetar sarkaar ke prati asantosh ko bhunaate hue bijepi ko satta se ukhaad phenkane kii ummid lagaae he
 If he was troubled in the Rajya Sabha here, it would have been a little difficult for him to win the trust of the people as an alternative for him in the state
 aise main ab ahamed patel kii is jeet ne congress ke andar ek ummid jarur jagaai he, haalanki party ko gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main jeet ke liye party kaaryakartaaon main is ummid ko jagaane rakhane or puri urja se chunaav main jute jane kii jarurat hogi

 Apart from this, Scheduled Castes especially Mala and Christian are also with YSR Congress
 lekin is giraftaar ne us madhyavarg ke voton ko party se dur chhitaka diya he jo bhrashtachar ko chunavi mudde ke rup main dekhtaa he
 There is an anti-incumbency sentiment against the Congress formed in the government for eight years, which is completely different from the Jagan episode

 Teja Narra, director of opinion research consultancy Eudhofud Strategies, says, "the 2014 elections for TDP will bring serious consequences as its position as the main opposition party will weaken

 The TDP had exposed mining and corruption scandals under the YSR regime and urged the Prime Minister to take action against them, but as usual the UPA and Congress could not take action on time
 ''mukhyamantri jor dekar kehete hai ki sibiai ke kadam se congress kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin
 He claimed, "jagan is trying to generate sympathy from his arrest
 hamen usase koi matlab nahin
 The Chief Minister, however, does not have an answer as to how the Congress slowly destroyed the YSR legacy, especially the successful development programs and poverty alleviation programs initiated by them
 congressiyon ko lagaataar yah dar sataae hue he ki jagan ke khilaaf is ladaai main kahin ve muft main shikaar na ban jaaen
 The arrest of Excise Minister Mopdevi Venkataraman came a day before Jagan was apprehended by CBI for questioning
 unhen waadarevu or nijampatanam bandargah or audyogic galiyara pariyojna se jude saudon ko anumati dene main kathith bhoomika ke liye giraftaar kiya gaya he
 In his two-page resignation letter sent to the Chief Minister on May 24, Venkataraman said, "I followed the order of the then Chief Minister YSR, went to his office on his call and signed the file in the presence of his secretary, though That file was not sent to my office

 When Jagan formally jumped into the field of politics, he realized what his personality was
 viesar ke vafaadaar kuch tatkaaleen congress netaaon ko jagan kii kshamta par bharosa na tha
 When Jagan embarked on a trip to Oderpu to thank those in mourning for his father six months after ysr's death, he was confident of his leadership ability only after seeing Jagan's commitment and restraint
 isi yatra main jagan ne apni takat kaa pradarshan kiya
 During a total journey of 265 days, he met 700 families in 5,152 villages, 114 cities and 13 districts and covered more than 17,430 kilometers of the entire state

 His appeal was that of a film star

 com / cjktbuejox rashtrapita mahatma gandhi kii 150ve jayanti ke uplakshya main gandhi vichaar padayatra par nikle chhattishgarh ke mukhyamantri bhupesh baghel ne bhaajapa ke rashtrawaad ke vichaar ko nakaar diya he
 He said that the nationalism of the Congress is the same as Mahatma Gandhi's idea of nationalism, that is, to keep the dissenters together and give respect
 baghel ne kaha ki bhaajapa kaa rashtrawaad vahi he jo nathuram godse kaa rashtrawaad tha
 That is, to eliminate those who disagree, to eliminate them
 mukhyamantri baghel 4 se 10 oktober tak gandhi vichaar yatra par hai
 In a conversation with India Today, the Chief Minister claimed that the Congress has not only run till now on Gandhi's ideology but will always stand
 unhone kaha ki yadi bhaajapa or modi mahatma gandhi kii raah par tanik bhi chale hote, to na to mob linching hoti, na hi inke khilaaf likhane waalon par deshadroh kaa mukadmaa darj hota or na hi bhaajapa ke andar unki party ke bade netaaon kii bejjati hoti
 Referring to the economic plight of the country, Baghel claimed that this is another model which proves that only the Congress is following Gandhi's idea
 baghel ne kaha, "gandhi kehete the ki samaaj ke kamjor logon ko majboot karo
 This is what we did in Chhattisgarh
 logon ke haath me paise die, bhaajapa kii tarah korporate ko paise nahin die
 Therefore, when the whole country is in a severe economic downturn, there is no recession in Chhattisgarh
 "mukhyamantri ne kaha ki auto sector main desh main mandi he lekin chhattisgarh main 13 fisadi kii vruddhi darj kii gai he
 There is a tremendous jump in document registration and revenue revenue
 sarrapha bazaar main 52 fisadi vruddhi darj kii gai he
 All this was possible because the state government gave money to the people
 mukhyamantri ne daawa kiya ki dhan kaa samarthan mulya 2,500 ru
 People got money in doing it
 baghel ne kaha ki unki sarkaar korporate ko paise dekar phayda nahin pahunchaati he, isliye chhattisgarh main mandi nahin he
 Modi benefited the corporate houses, so the economic slowdown is growing rather than decreasing

 Railways have identified the reasons due to which the trains are getting delayed but it will take two-three years to curb this
 railvene yah pahchaan kii he ki railway yardon kii vajah se lakhanu, varanasi jaisi pramukh jagahon par trene vilamb se chhot rahi hai
 From here, trains have also got to stand on the outer signal
 ab uttar pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu ke alaava do pramukh dharmik shaharon varanasi evam faijabad ke railway steshnon par trainon ke ‘let’ hone yaa ‘outer signal’ par der tak khadey rahane kii shikayaton ko dur karne ke makasad se uttar railway yahaan ke yardon kaa ‘kayakalp’ karne ja rahaa he
 Anil Kumar Lahoti, Divisional Railway Manager (lucknow), Northern Railway, said in an interview, 'the problem of trains getting late or standing on Outer signal at busy stations like Lucknow and Varanasi is due to yards
 ise dur karne ke liye bade paimaane par yardon ko phir se banaaya jayega
 'it is noteworthy that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is from Varanasi while Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh is a Lok Sabha MP from Lucknow
 unhone bataaya, ‘sirf lakhanu or varanasi hi nahin, balki uttar railway ke lakhanu mandal ke tahat aane vaale faijabad, sultanpur, pratapgarh, raibareli, prayag jaise steshnon par bhi yardon kaa kayakalp kiya jayega
 This work will be completed within two to three years
 ’ lahoti ne kaha ki in steshnon par yard kaaphi puraane hai or platformon kii lambaai bhi kam he, jisaki vajah se trainon ke parichaalan main dikkat aati he
 He said, 'earlier there used to be trains of ten, twelve or fourteen coaches and the platforms and yards were built accordingly but now the trains are of 22 to 24 coaches
 aise main puraane yard or platform lambii trainon ke anukool nahin hai
 Asked about the difficulty in operating the trains during the new construction of the yard at Varanasi railway station, Lahoti said that during the period of construction, trains will be run from railway stations like Maduadih and Varanasi City
 iske liye in donon steshnon par suvidhaon kaa vikaas karnaa hoga
 He said that he had a conversation with Divisional Railway Manager of North Eastern Railway in this regard
 purvottar railway ke saath samanvay kar is kaary ko anjaam diya jayega
 Regarding Faizabad, Lahoti said that there is 'mechanical interlocking' and the signals are also old
 vahaan yard kaa nirmaan karne ke saath hi aadhunik electranik interlaking or elidi rangon vaale signal lagaaye jaaenge
 He informed that in the process of renovating the yards, new 'washing lines' will also be built, so that the trains can be cleaned better
 philhal yard main gaadi ‘risive’ karne yaa ‘dispech’ karne main baadhaaen aati hai
 Lahoti hoped that the trains would cease to be 'late' when the yards were rejuvenated, while increasing the length of the platforms would facilitate passengers to get off the trains

 Punjab captain and bowler Ashwin fires the Mankanding controversy by throwing out Jos Buttler standing at the non-striking end without throwing the ball
 unhone out karne se pehle butler ko chetavanee bhi nahin di thi
 After this, the Merylbon Cricket Club (MCC), which is considered the guardian of cricket laws, including the legendary players, had described Ashwin's actions against the spirit of the game
 emsisi ne kaha, ‘maamle kii samiksha karne ke baad hamen nahin lagata ki yah khel bhaavana ke tahat tha
 We believe that Ashwin took longer between arriving at the crease and stopping
 aise main ballebaaj ummid karata he ki gend phenk di gai he
 Butler may have thought that the ball was thrown and he was in his zone
 ’vahiin, purv bhartiya cricketer madan laal ne kaha ki aswin ko isse bachanaa chahie tha
 He said, 'looking at Ashwin's level and international career, i don't think he did it right
 vah bahut bade khilaadi he or aisi harakat kaaphi choti cheez he
 If there was a Virat Kohli or any other Indian player in place of Butler, he would have got a lot of criticism
 aisi harakat khel kaa hissaa nahin he
 Ashwin is right in his place
 lekin, unhen aisa nahin karnaa chahie tha
 England captain Eoin Morgan said, 'I can't believe what i saw

 Ashwin will definitely regret it

 *** lalu yadav ko chaara ghotaalaa maamle main doshi qaraar die jane ke baad argedy ke siyaasi bhavishya ko lekar charchaaen joro par hai
 It is believed that the task of taking command of the RJD and carrying forward the political legacy of Lalu Yadav will be on the shoulders of Tejashwi Yadav
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki tejasvi is jimmedaari ko uthaane main kitna taiyaar he
 How far is it possible in the difficult times of Arjodi that Tejashwi is able to establish himself in the politics of Bihar, and to what extent his party leaders can help him, it will tell the time to come? When Nitish Kumar broke ties with the identity alliance and formed a government with the BJP, Tejashwi Yadav took to the road to create an atmosphere against him
 iske jariye unhone bihar kii yatra kiya auki jagah-jagah nitish or bijepi ke khilaaf jamkar bole
 Stunning Cossiai identity from this trip
 dipti siem rahete hue itani pahchaan wo nahin bana sake, jitani sarkaar se alag hone ke baad bani
 While talking to Aaj Tak, RJD General Secretary Ashok Singh said that the entire party under the leadership of Tejashwi will go to the court of justice for the justice of Lalu Prasad
 pradesh bhar kii yatra hogi or bijepi kii sajishon ko benakaab kiya jayega
 Lalu Yadav's family is being harassed due to his ideology and a conspiracy
 isse pradesh kii janata main aakrosh he
 In Tejaswi's decisions, Lalu's glimpses of Jajaji are following the footsteps of his father Lalu Prasad Yadav's ideology
 isaki jhalkamahagathbandhanse naata tuutane ke baad dikhi
 After the formation of the joint government of Nitish Kumar and the BJP, the manner in which Tejashwi Yadav gave his speech in the assembly was reflected in Lalu's people
 varisht patrkaar kaashi prasad yadav kehete hai ki jis prakaar lalu apane bhaashanon main obisi, dalit or alpsankhyak samudaay ke logon kii baat karat the usee tarah tejasvi bhi saamaajik nyaay or dharm-nirpeksh kii baat ko purajor tareeke se uthaate hai
 The real challenge of Tejashwi will be to go through the real test of handling the organization and keeping the party united
 court ke faisla aane se pehle hi lalu ne tejasvi ko apane uttaradhikari ko taur par pesh karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 While many seniors were against Lalu's decision, it is a challenge in front of Tejashwi to balance with such leaders
 party ke netaa ashok singh kehete hai ki tejasvi ke andar wo sari kabaliyat he, party chalaane kii
 He knows to respect the senior leaders and also to take the youth along
 in sabake baavjood puri party he jo sadak se saansad tak sangharsh karne ko taiyaar he
 Tejaswi will be on the target of the opposition In the absence of Lalu, if Tejashwi takes charge of the party, then the opposition parties will be directly on target
 aise vakt main unhen samajhaboojhkar siyaasi kadam badhaane honge
 Senior journalist Kashi Yadav believes that many people from Tejashwi to his family are under investigation
 aise main dabaav main aakar koi galat faisla bhi le sakate hai, jisase unhen bachakar chalane kii jarurat hogi
 Because Lalu is the only leader in the country who has not gone with BJP in any way
 tejasvi bhi usee raah par chal rahe hai aise me unhen is tarah kii dabaav ke liye pehle se hi taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 In such a time, who will stand together, this is the time for real friends to know and to walk together
 lalu ke jail jane ke baad unke saath koun saath koun sa dal saath khadaa hota he or koun dur jaataa he
 Because in the bad times, the shadow of a human being also leaves
 tejasvi ke liye ye vakt aisa he, jab unhen bhavishya ke dost kii pahchaan kerani hogi
 It is believed that Tejashwi has also found his partner
 pichley dinon congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saath dinar kiya or unke adhyaksh kii tajposhi ke samay pradhanmantri kaa rup dekha
 This is testifying that Tejashwi has made up his mind to walk with future partner Congress President Rahul Gandhi

 kya yah aisi party he jo vaaki 10 saal baad satta ke najadik pahunchati dikhaai de rahi he? bijepi main pichley teen hafton main machaa ghamaasan to kam se kam is baat kaa saboot nahin detaa
 Tackling tickets, protests, pulls, burning effigies of party leaders, making public opposition to new leaders and alliances
 ek-duusare ke khilaaf bayaan dena
 Forging the names of two contenders for the post of Deputy Prime Minister
 yaa phir yah sab ghamaasan sirf isliye ho rahaa he, kyonki bijepi satta ke najadik pahunchati dikh rahi he or har shaks satta kii bandarbaat main apana hissaa chahta he? Why is 'free for all' in BJP right now? Why do you feel that the central leadership is weakening? Why are party leaders putting their feet at each other's feet in the process of getting ahead? If this is the situation of mutual fight before the government is formed, what will happen if the government is formed? Will the party leaders not 'behead' each other to become ministers and share ministries? darasal, iske liye bijepi ke buniyadi charitra ko samajhnaa hoga
 Cadre-based political parties, whether they are left parties or BJP, follow the principle of collective leadership
 pehle jansangh or ab bijepi, kabhi bhi ek vyakti kaa nirvivaad rup se netritv na to rahaa he or na hi rah saktaa he
 bjp's door is in the hands of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 yah jarur he ki bataur pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar or party main number ek ke sthaan par rahe
 But to keep the balance, LK Advani was replaced by number two
 isi tarah ab jabaki narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya gaya he, party adhyaksh rajnath singh jodi ke rup main unke saath dikhaai dete hai
 But for this Modi should not be omnipotent, the party ignores the resentment of leaders like LK Advani, Sushma Swaraj, so that the advani-sushma pair can balance with Modi
 lekin bijepi main kya duusare netaaon ko bhi vahi sthaan yaa takat hasil he, jo adwani or sushamaa ko he? kya party ke duusare netaa bhi apni naaraazgi saarvajanik kar anushaasan kii lakshmana rekha paar na karne ke aarope se batch sakate hai? shaayad aisa nahin he
 Sabir Ali, who came to BJP from JDU, was publicly opposed by party vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Twitter
 tark diya ja saktaa he ki shriramulu ko bijepi main shaamil karne kaa virodh sushamaa swaraj ne bhi twitor par diya tha, isliye nakvi ne kya galat kiya
 But Naqvi added Dawood Ibrahim's name to BJP and caused a huge loss to the party during the elections
 shaayad isiilie bijepi kaa ek dhada sabir ali ke saath unke khilaaf bhi karrwai ke paksh main he
 It is a matter of course that Sabir Ali himself has given relief to the party by asking to keep his membership on hold
 13 sitambar, 2013 ko narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 Political experts had then predicted that there would be a ground-floor difference between the BJP before September 13 and the BJP after September 13, as internal protests, mutual fighting and fights will no longer be public since the leadership issue is resolved
 , There will be a change in the way the party leaders work, all will work together to bring the party which has been in exile of power for 10 years into the government
 lekin pichley teen hafton ke kalah ne party ko satta kii daud main peeche dhakel diya he
 Will the weak-looking leadership, which is facing challenges from within the party, be able to fulfill bjp's mission 272? somvaar ko dow kalam ke nidhan ke baad soshal media par unase judi kai dilachasp baaten share kii ja rahi hai

 aam taur par jahaan raajnneetik hastiyaan media se kanni katati dikhti hai, vahiin kalam sahab, patrakaron ko shaayad bacchon se kam nahin samajhate the
 Dr
 Kalam's talk was the magic of the childhood story 'bagpiper' whose melody played could not be ignored
 enditivi ke patrkaar raveesh kumaar ne apane kaarykram 'prime time' main kalam sahab ko yaad karte hue bataaya tha ki kis tarah press conference shuru hone se pehle vah sab patrakaron ko is tarah baith jane kii hidaayat dete the jaise skool main bacchon ko bolaa jaataa he "baith jaao, sab log chupchaap baith jaao

 He was asked a question, without answering, he said, "next question
" ' maajaraa kisi ko samaj main nahin aayaa
 Then we saw that he was actually noting all the questions
 unhone kaha 'maine tivi par dekha he, tum press vaale ek jaise sawaal baar baar poochhate ho, isliye main saare sawaal note kar rahaa hum taaki sabake jawaab de sakuun or mujhe kuch bhi doharaana naa pade
 Not only this, after the press conference was over, he read a poem and told all the journalists to repeat these lines behind him
 " yakeenan media waalon ne nahin sochaa hoga ki ek hone vaale raashtrapati kii press conference main unhen aisa kuch karnaa padegaa
 Journalists with their heavy questions must have returned to the office with a different headline
 tippaniyan Daniel Lack, who works in the Delhi bureau of the international media organization BBC, wrote to the former president, recalling that Kalam himself used to call his office and talk about his favorite subject 'education'
 apane phone kalam khud hi lagaate the
 However, Kalam had a problem as to why the Indian media is so 'negative'? In 2005, an article by Dr
 Kalam appeared in the New Yorker magazine in which he questioned why India is so ashamed to talk about its success? Giving the example of the tribal village of Dr
 Sudarshan, he wrote that there are so many stories of success in our country, but the media never talks of such success

 haalanki kalam ko dikkat thi ki bhartiya media itnaa 'negative' kyon he ? 2005 main new yorker megezin main dow kalam kaa ek lekh chapa tha jisamen unhone sawaal kiya tha ki bharat ko apni kamyaabi ke bare main baat karne main itani shame kyon aati he? dow sudarshan ke adivasee gaanv kaa udhaaharan dete hue unhone likhaa tha ki hamaare desh main safalataa kii itani bemisaal kahaniyaan he lekin media aisi kamyaabi kii kabhi baat nahin karata
 Citing the example of Israeli newspapers, Kalam wrote that so many attacks, so many tragedies happen in that country, but there was a newspaper on the front page of the newspaper that i had in my hand one morning that turned my desert into a beautiful plantation

 An 8-lane stadium has been built here for air-conditioned indoor stadium and 10 meter shooting range
 30 len kii ek or shooting range kaa nirmaan apane aakhri charan main he
 But the result is not visible, but the question is why despite so much investment, some result is not visible? Why is there so much disappointment among shooters? The stadium has been built, but why are there no other resources and facilities related to the shooting? Why have not a single national medal been received in the last five years? However, Umesh Paswan, in charge of Kalyan Bigha, does not see any shortage here
 shootaron ke asantosh kii shikaayat ke jawaab main ve kehete hai, ''sansadhano kii koi kami nahin he

 The narmada-kshipra Link Project was launched on November 29, 2012
 is saal, farvari maah main omkareshwar sinchai pariyojna se narmada kaa pani laakar kshipraa main choda gaya he
 This water will reach the city of Ujjain after covering a distance of 115 kilometers
 iske liye chaar sthanon par pumping stesan bhi banaae gaye hai
 The state government claims that on completion of the plan, the scarcity of drinking water in about 3,000 villages and 70 towns of the Malwa region will be removed
 yahi nahin, narmada ke pani kii madad se lagbhag 17 lakh acre jameen main sinchai kii suvidha bhi uplabdh karai ja sakegi
 That is why the people of Malwa are eagerly waiting for Narmada water
 lekin is pariyojna ke virodh main bhi swar uth rahe hai
 "water for the scheme is to be diverted from the canals of the Omkareshwar project under construction on the Narmada," says Rahmat, who is associated with the Manthan Study Center, a research-related organization in the field of water-energy
 is pani ke liye nimad ke kisaanon ko dashakon se sapane dikhaae ja rahe hai
 But before this water could reach the fields of Nimar, dreams have already been shown to revive the rivers of Malwa and end the water crisis in the area
 '' ve iske peeche hiden agenda dekh rahe hai, ''is pipeline ko pithampur audyogic kshetra kii ore modaa gaya he
 This is actually the hidden agenda of the government

 "but the people of Malwa believe that the stream of Narmada will definitely reduce their struggles
" isliye to indore ke bhoundvas main behate narmada ke pani ko dekhakar kshetra kii mahilaon kii ankhon main chamak saaf dekhi ja sakati he
 Says Bhanwar Bai, 65, who is worshiping Narmada, "I have come here to see Narmada Maiya
" kshipraa main saal bhar pani nahin rahata he
 Now Narmada Maia has arrived
 hamen puraa vishwaas he ki fasal kii sinchai main pareshaani nahin hogi
 We will get water throughout the year
 '' logon main yah aashaa bhi jaagi he ki sukhi kshipraa main pani aane se isse jude ilaake kaa bhoojal str bhi bad jayega or unke boring bhari garmi main bhi nahin sookhenge
 Says 62-year-old Radha Bai, "I never thought that the holy water of Narmada would come so close to our village, now the good days have come

 Says 65-year-old farmer Vikram Singh, "so far we have been taking two crops a year
 narmada kaa pani mil jane par ham ek or fasal le sakate hai
 Hukum Singh of the village believes the same
 ve kehete hai, '' saal bhar pani uplabdh rahanaa hamaare liye bahut badi khushkhabari he
 "suresh Chaudhary of the village says," Normally after January there is no water left in the Kshipra river
 is saal barish acchhee hui he isliye thodaa-bahut pani bachaa hua he
 This too would dry up when the summer started and we would have to face water crisis
 ab aisa nahin hoga, narmada jo aa gai he
 "engineers of Narmada Valley Development Authority (NVDA) have completed the work for this project within about 14 months
" iske liye, narmada nadi ke pani ko panpon ke jariye 50 kilometre kii duuri tak bahaakar laayaa gaya or phir 350 meter kii oonchai par lift karke kshipraa ke udgam sthal ujjaini gaanv tak pahunchaaya gaya

 It is understandable that the water which is not much in quantity from the needs of a city, how can it be believed to fulfill the needs of the entire Malwa as well as the Kshipra river alive? If the rivers could have been made alive through the pipes then no river of the country would have remained dry till now
 ''rahamat is yojana main aane vaale kharch par bhi sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 He says, "it is clear from the documents of NVDA that Rs
 9 on pumping one thousand liters of water
 kharch aayega
 In this case, if administrative expenses and leakages are added, then this figure is Rs 72
 prati hajaar litre aata he
 It is not possible for anyone to get water at this price

 reyaan skool main maasoom pradhyumna kii galaa retkar hatya maamle kii jaanch main sibiai ne shuru kar di he
 After registering an FIR in the case, a three-member CBI team reached the school in Gurugram on Saturday morning
 isse pehle sibiai team ne shuukravaar shaam ko hi gudgaanv police headquater pahunchakar haryana police se is cese kaa charge liya tha
 In fact, due to media pressure and the efforts of Pradyuman's father, the Haryana government handed over the case to the CBI
 vahiin shuukravaar subah hipradhyumna ke pita ne varun thakurne kaha tha ki agar sibiai maamle ko apane haathon main nahin leti he, to somvaar ko supreme court jaaenge
 The question of who and why he murdered innocent Pradyuman in Ryan School still remains in the minds of the people
 isse pehle haryana ke mukhyamantrimanohar laal khatterne jab pradhyumna thakur ke ghar jaakar elaan kiya tha ki ab maamle kii jaanch sibiai ko saunpi ja rahi he, to gharavaalon ko yah ummid jaagi he ki shaayad ab unako sawaal kaa jawaab mil jayega
 Earlier on Friday, Pradyuman's father Thakur said, "it has been seven days when we were told that a CBI inquiry has started in the case
" maine is sandarbh main ek mail or soshal media post ke jariye piemo or grahamantri ko request bheji thi
 Then be told when the CBI is starting the process of investigation
 ' thakur ne kaha, 'maine ek patr videshmantri sushamaa swaraj ko bhi bheja he, ek maa hone ke naate shaayad wo meraa dard samaj saken
 In his press conference, Varun Thakur had raised three questions and asked for a speedy inquiry into the matter
 peedit pita or unke vakil ne doosraa sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki skool ke maalik pinto ko raajnneetik partiyon dwaara bachaane kii koshish ho rahi he? or teesraa sawaal ye ki centre sarkaar unke request par jawaab kyon nahin de rahi he
 After this, the CBI took charge in the evening and filed an FIR
 vahiin haryana police daawa kar rahi he ki vah maamle kii tah tak pahunch chuki he or chargeshit lagbhag banakar taiyaar he
 But the disclosure of any case does not just mean that the police should put a man in front of someone who is committing a crime
 tahakikat kaa matlab hota he ki us maamle se jude saare sawaalon ke santoshjanak jawaab police ke saamne hon
 In Pradyuman's murder, there are not one, but many questions, which the police have not yet considered necessary to answer
 pradhyumna ke gharavaale baar-baar yah kah rahe hai ki kahin uski hatya isliye to nahin ho gai ki usne kuch aisa dekh liya tha jisase bhed khulne kaa dar tha
 There are many unresolved questions about which the CBI will have to deal with

 gauratlab he ki sarkaar ‘da muslim vimen protection of ritis in marij act’ naam se is vidheyak ko laa rahi he
 This law will only apply to three divorces (INSTANT TALAQ, ie divorce-e-biddat)
 is kanoon ke baad koi bhi muslim pati agar patni ko teen talaak degaa to wo gaiyr-kanoonee hoga
 Henceforth, three divorces granted in any form, whether oral or written or in a message, would be invalid
 jo bhi teen talaak degaa, usko teen saal kii sajaa or jurmaana ho saktaa he
 That is, giving triple talaq would be a non-bailable and cognizable offense
 isamen magistrate tay karegaa ki kitna jurmaana hoga
 PM Narendra Modi had formed a group of ministers to legislate on triple talaq, which included Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Ravi Shankar Prasad, PP Chaudhary and Jitendra Singh

 vah muslim mahilaon ke shashaktikaran ke liye nahin, balki ek tarah raajnneetik stand he
 He said that in the judgment given by the Supreme Court on triple talaq, the law making cases were against five judges from 7 judges
 is tarah ye faisla alpsankhyak faisla tha
 In such a situation, Modi government wants to politics through this bill
 teen talaak ke khilaaf bill main praavdhaan-bill ke prarup ke mutabik ek vakt main teen talaak (bolkar, likhakar yaa email, esemes or whatsap jaise electronic madhyam se) gaiyrkanoonee hoga
 - Three divorces at once will be unlawful and void
 aisa karne vaale pati ko teen saal ke karawas kii sajaa ho sakati he
 This would be considered a non-bailable and cognizable offense
 -droft bill ke mutabik ek baar main teen talaak yaa 'talaak e biddat' par lagu hoga or yah peedita ko apane or naaballig bacchon ke liye guzaara bhatta maangane ke liye magistrate se guhaar lagane kii shakti degaa

 The BJP and the Sangh have been happy ever since the senior Congress leader and former President Pranab Mukherjee went to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh headquarters in Nagpur
 vahiin, ise congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii aresas virdohi muhim par aghat mana ja rahaa he
 Rahul has been continuously attacking the RSS for the last several years
 desh main sangh ke khilaaf maahaul banane kii koshishon main jute hue hai
 This is the reason why many Congress leaders were opposing Pranab to go to the Sangh program and were requesting him not to go
 haalanki, ab ve ise apane paksh main bataane main jute hue hai ki pranab ne sangh mukhyalay jaakar sangh ko naseehaten deen
 Significantly, former President Pranab Mukherjee joined the Sangh program at a time when Congress President Rahul Gandhi in the country was trying to bring PM Modi and anti-rss forces on one platform
 aise main pranab kaa janaa vipaksh ke baaki secular dalon ko bhi nagavar gujara
 It is believed that this bet by Pranab Mukherjee has shaken Rahul's political ideological base
 darasalrahul gandhi 2014 ke baad se sangh ke khilaafasakriy or aakraamak rukh akhriyaar kiye hue hai
 Rahul has described RSS as the killer of Mahatma Gandhi
 haalanki rahul ke bayaan ko sangh ne adaalat main chunauti di or is par sunwaayee chal rahi he
 The Congress president is directly attacking the Sangh at its election rallies and public meetings
 rahul sangh ko desh ko baantne vaala, dalit virdohi or bharat kii vividhta ko na maanane vaala sanghathan kehete hai
 After taking over the reins of the party, Rahul has become more vocal against the Sangh
 rahul sangh ke saath piem modi par bhi baraabar hamale karte rahe hai
 He also calls Narendra Modi a hater of politics and an anti-dalit, backward and minority
 ve is baat par lagaataar jor dete hai ki piem modi sangh se aae hai or uski vichaardhaara ko desh main thopane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The Sangh and Modi do not respect the plurality of the country
 bataa den ki modi raajnneeti main aane se pehle sangh ke prachaarak rahe hai
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi was busy in laying his political check by drawing a strict line about the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 aise main pranab mukherjee kaa sangh ke kaarykram main janaa or aresas ke sansthaapak headgavar ko bharat kaa sachcha sapoot bataanaa usee tarah kaa he, jaise 13 saal pehle bijepi ke tatkaaleen adhyaksh laalkrishna adwani ne pakistan jaakar jinna kii kabr par phool chadaaye or unhen secular qaraar diya tha
 Pranab emphasized the diversity and plurality of the country in the program of the Sangh and said that India is not a country of one religion and one idea
 hamaari buniyaad sahishnutaa or ahimsa main he
 The Congress is uncomfortable with Pranab Mukherjee leaving the RSS program
 ye baat party netaaon ke bayanon se bhi jaahir hota he
 Congress leader Anand Sharma said that millions of Congress workers and those who believe in India's plurality, diversity and core values of the Republic of India were deeply saddened by Pranab da, who was the leader of Congress at the RSS headquarters
 sharma ne aage kaha ki samvaad keval usee ke saath ho saktaa he, jo sunne samajhane or badlaav main vishwaas rakhata ho
 There seems to be nothing that the RSS is about to withdraw from its agenda
 uskaa makasad sirf vyapak sweekruti hasil karne kii he
 And Pranab Mukherjee's visit to Nagpur will help the Sangh to increase its acceptance in society and in various states
 sangh isse pehle 1962 main nehru ke bulaave or gandhi kii tarif jaise udhaaharan detaa tha
 After today, whenever Congress people criticize the Sangh, the Sangh will have the example of Pranab Mukherjee that he came to the Sangh platform and addressed the program
