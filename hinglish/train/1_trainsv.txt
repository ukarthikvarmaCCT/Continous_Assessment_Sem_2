 Three big officers of the Indian Negotiating Team, MP Singh, AR Sule and Rajeev Verna, raised strong objections and wrote that the removal of anti-corruption provisions paves the way for business directly from the commercial suppliers
 jab kharid do sarkaron ke bich ho rahi he tab phir france sarkaar apni javabdehi in companiyon par kaise taal sakati he
 When the French government does not take accountability then what is the point of the deal between the two governments
 yahi nahin teenon adhikari likhte hai ki aisa karnaa vittiya eemaandaaree kii buniyadi sharton se samjhauta karnaa he jo uchit nahin hoga
 Three officials of the Indian negotiating team write that doing so would compromise the basic conditions of financial honesty
 ye kisi deal he ki raksha sachiv se lekar bhartiya baatcheet dal ke adhikari alag alag str par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 In the report of February 8, you saw that many officials, including the Secretary of Defense, are writing on file that the Prime Minister's office has joined their level
 raksha mantralay ko bina bataae france se baatcheet karne laga he jiske kaaran unke molbhav kii kshamta par asar pad rahaa he
 Now the February 11 report raises even more serious questions
 24 agast 2016 ko raksha maamalon kii mantrimandal samiti kii baithak hoti he
 This meeting is chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 iske baad sitambar 2016 main raksha kareed parishad kii baithak hoti he
 It is headed by Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar
 is baithak main aath sharton ko hataa diya jaataa he
 In which the anti-corruption provision is also removed
 23 sitambar 2016 ko bharat or france ke bich samjhaute par dastakhat hota he
 Ajay Shukla has just made it clear when it happens that the conditions on which the Prime Minister's Committee approves the deal removes the Committee of the Ministry of Defense
 kya iske baad bhi sarkaar paardarshita kaa daawa karnaa chaahegi, kya use bataanaa nahin chahie ki rafaal deal se bhrashtachar na karne kii sharten kyon hataai gayi
 Was this done in some way to pave the way for the transaction
 aakhir dasso company or hathiyaaron kii supplai karne vaali company ko embidie france ko bhrashtachar virdohi sharton se riyaayat kyon di gai
 N
 Ram has also made another disclosure with this
 france kii sarkaar apni taraf se guarantee nahin dena chaahati thi
 The bank did not even want to give the guarantee
 tab raksha mantralay kii taraf se suzav diya gaya ki ek escro acount banaaya jaae
 That means the French government has an account, the Indian government will put money in that account and the French companies will be paid the money
 magar is prastaav ko bhi kinare laga diya gaya
 Why would any government want to make such a deal that you take our money but we do not want any guarantee from you
 letters of confort mila lekin use kanoonee haisiyat hasil nahin he

 Ram has printed a note of Sudhanshu Mohanty
 sudhanshu mohanti us vakt dephence sarvice ke vittiya salaahkaar the
 The newspaper has also printed a copy of Sudhanshu Mohanty's note
 jisamen ve likhte hai ki kaash mere paas puri filein or tamaam masalon par vichaar karne ke liye paryaapt samay hota
 Now since the Defense Minister needs the file immediately, i want to keep some things from the financial point of view
 ab aap 8 farvari kii report yaad karen
 The note published by The Hindu is signed by Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar dated 11 January 2016
 pehali baar teen adhikari 24 nanvabar 2015 ko etraz jataate hai
 More than a month later, the Defense Minister writes that the Prime Minister's Office is monitoring the deal
 aap log unke pradhan sachiv se baat kar maamle ko sulajhaa len
 The Defense Minister does not write this, your questions raised are wrong
 sudhanshu mohanti kaa note 14 janvari kaa he yani teen din baad
 In three days, what happened after the defense minister took more than a month to sign the file, Sudhanshu Mohanty, who is a financial advisor, did not get full time to read the file
 sudhanshu mohanti khayr jaldi main suzav dete hai ki ab jab na bank guarantee aa rahi he or na sarkaar kii guarantee aa rahi he tab aisi sthiti main sarkaar ke hiton kii raksha kaise hogi
 Any advance payment from the government account should get a bank guarantee
 hamen is baat ko lekar satark rahanaa chahie ki isse laagat bad sakati he
 Therefore, a proposal with cost with bank guarantee and without bank guarantee should be sought
 sudhanshu mohanti saaf saaf likh rahe hai ki paisa dene ke maamle main france kii sarkaar ko shaamil karnaa chahie
 It may also be that an escrow account is created
 yah khaataa france sarkaar ke niyantran main he
 The Government of India should deposit money in that account and the money should be given to these companies from there
 aisa karne se is deal main france kii sarkaar naitik rup javabdeh ho jaati he
 There is also accountability in ensuring supply
 is tarah ke salahon ko nazarandaaz karne se kise laabh pahunchaa, sawaal uthta he
 Why a system in which India's money was safe was removed
 hamane sudhanshu mohanti se baat kii, jo lagaataar is maamle par likh bhi rahe hai magar apni noting ke bare main baat baahar aa jane ke baad unhone bataaya ki unka paksh kya tha or kya hona chahie tha
 Sudhanshu Mohanty is also saying that when a government buys from a company within the country, it also takes a bank guarantee, then how can it happen without a bank guarantee when there is an agreement with the outside country
 en ram ke is pardaafash par waisi halchal nahin hui jaisi 8 farvari kii report se hui thi
 Then Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman spoke in the Lok Sabha as well as outside
 media se bhi alag se baat kii
 The report of 11 February again raises the big question that this deal will not punish in the event of corruption, for whose benefit it was ensured
 kya aapane aisi deal kabhi suni he jisamen ye shart hataa di jaae ki rishwat dene kaa maamla pakadaaya to dand diya jayega
 Meanwhile, George, the associate editor of The Hindu newspaper, Verghese K
 George, has justified the story related to the Rafale deal in his newspaper on Friday
 da hindu akhbaar main rafaal saude se jude note main tatkaaleen raksha mantri manohar parrikar kaa haath se likhit note naa chhapane ke peeche unhone apana tark bhi diya

 unhone kaha ki america adhikariyon ne desh bhar se 22 dallalon, bharti karne waalon or niyoktaaon ko giraftaar kiya hai, jinamein kuch america bhi shaamil hai
 These people allegedly conspired with foreign nationals to obtain student and foreign labor visas under the 'pay and Stay' enrollment at New Jersey College ie University of Northern New Jersey (UNNJ)
 rajyamantri ne loksabhaa main die apane likhit uttar main kaha, 'college kii sthapana or uskaa sanchaalan america gharelu suraksha jaanch pravartan karrwai ke hissaa ke tahat hua tha
 "during the investigation, according to the US government, hsi's special agents identified 1076 foreign nationals who first entered the US for admission to other accredited schools on the basis of F-1 nonimmigrant visas and later," he said

 'singh ne kaha, 'is tarah ke 306 bhartiya vidhyaarthee hai
 It is believed that the American authorities have ended the enrollment of these students
 'mantri ke anusaar, america adhikariyon ne yah bhi kaha he ki jin vidhyaarthiyon kaa namakan khatm kar diya gaya he or unhone pun:sthaapan ke liye aavedan nahin kiya he yaa jinka pun:sthaapan aavedan asweekaar kar diya gaya he, ve turant desh chhod den

" ' Mexico, who made a big upset by beating defending champions Germany in their first FIFA World Cup opening match in Russia, would like to beat South Korea and enter the final-16 today
 mexico group-epa main ek match main teen ank lekar sweden ke baad duusare number par maujuud he or ab uske paas agle daur main pahunchane kaa mauka he
 At the same time, South Korea lost 0–1 to Sweden in their first match, due to which the team is at the bottom of the group at number four
 mexico ne toonarment main ab tak ummid se badhkar pradarshan kiya he or germany ko maat dekar usne vishwa ko chaunkaa diya he
 Compared to Germany and Mexico, no one expected Mexico to perform like that
 lekin uske 22 varshiya khilaadi hervig lojaano kii ore se 35wein minute main kiye gaye ekmaatr gol ke dam par mexico ne pratiyogita main jeet ke saath khaataa kholaa
 This is Mexico's first win against Germany since 1985
 mexico argentina main saal 1978 main hue world cap ke baad se ab tak world cap main kabhi bhi apana doosraa match nahin haara he
 The team would like them to maintain this record against Korea as well
 world cap main mexico or korea duusari baar aamane-saamne ho rahe hai
 The two teams met for the first time in France 20 years ago in 1998, when Mexico defeated Korea 3–1
 mexico kii koshish hogi ki vah manovaigyanik badhat ke saath korea ke khilaaf mukaable main utre
 When Maradona hugged and cried his little Russian fan, see VIDEO In this match, everyone's eyes will be on Javier Hanardez, who is one match away from completing his 50 international matches and he can achieve this against Korea
 30 saal ke hanardes ne apane desh ke liye ab tak sabase zyada gol daage hai or mexico ko korea ke khilaaf bhi unase gol daagne kii ummid hogi
 In the match against Korea, Mexico is also considered a winning contender, because the team has never lost to Asian teams in the history of World Cup
 haalanki record banate hi hai tuutane ke liye or dakshin korea chaahegi ki vah is baat ko sarthak kare
 On the other hand, South Korea's record in the World Cup is not perfect
 mexico main saal 1986 main world cap main lautne ke baad se dakshin korea kii team kabhi toonarment main apana doosraa match nahin jeet pai he
 The team's morale has dropped after the defeat to Sweden
 team ko apane star midfilder ki sungaueng se kaaphi ummiden hongi jo apana 104 match khilne utrenge
 South Korea, the only team to reach the semifinals of the World Cup in the Asian countries, had a chance to score against Sweden in the sixth minute with a free kick
 son ke shot ko kim shin wouk ne header se gol post tak pahunchane kii koshish kii, lekin vah net se bahut dur chali gai or dakshin korea kii team khaataa kholane kaa mauka chook gai thi
 However, the team would like their team to take inspiration from the victory of other teams of Asia and do something new against Mexico

 Promising the next days to be exciting, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Friday that India will be able to match China's growth rate once the population deprived of banking facilities comes under the purview of organized financial structure
 jetali ne yah bhi kaha ki aaj vaastavik chunauti nivesh main teji laana, buniyadi dhaanche par dhyaan dena tathaa vinirmaan kshetra main bade paimaane par sudhaar laana he
 He said, i think the time has come to enter the next stage, where we can accelerate these goals, which is necessary for the revival of the economy
 isiaisiai bank ke ek kaarykram main jetali ne kaha, aane vaale din atyant romaanchakaari hone ja rahaa he
 
 
 Whenever these sections (population deprived of banks) will have a rupay card and a lot of money spent will go to the banking sector, probably not the day when we will be able to equal China's economic growth
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki jab adhik-se-adhik log roope debit card kaa upyog karenge, aarthik gatividhiyon kaa ek bada hissaa jo banking daayre se baahar he, vah jidipi (sakal gharelu utpaada) main pratibimbit hoga
 In recent times, China has been the fastest growing country in the world
 usne kareeb do dashak tak dahaai ank main vruddhi dar hasil kii he
 On the other hand, India scored 9 in 2006-07
 6 pratishat aarthik vruddhi dar hasil kii or uske baad se isamen kami ai tathaa pichley do varshon main yah paanch pratishat se neeche rahi he
 Seeing the government's grudge following the growing uproar across the country over the Kathua and Unnao rape incident, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other ministers have started breaking their silence
 vipaksh piem modi kii chuppi par lagaataar hamalaa kar rahaa tha or aaj pradhanmantri ne bhi is par chuppi tod di
 Like PM, other ministers have also come forward on this matter
 khaastaur par jaise-jaisekathuaki ghatana kaa bare main logon ko vistaar se pataa chal rahaa he ki kaise 8 saal kii maasoom bacchee ke saath darindagi kii gai, logon kaa gussa bad rahaa he
 After the march of Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Vadra in protest against this incident in Delhi on Thursday night, the pressure on the government has increased further
 aakhirkaar bole piem modishuukravaar ko ek kaarykram ke dauraan pradhanmantri modigangarepaki donon ghatnaon par pehali baar bole
 He said that the entire country is ashamed by such incidents
 betiyon ko nyaay milakar rahegaa
 It is our responsibility to provide justice
 unhone aage kaha ki jis tarah kii ghatnaayen hamane beete dinon main dekhi hai, wo saamaajik nyaay kii avadharana ko chunauti detii hai
 It is shameful for any civilized society
 ek samaaj ke rup main, ek desh ke rup main ham sab iske liye sharmasaar hai
 Earlier on Friday, Rahul Gandhi also took a tweet on Modi's silence by tweeting that the country is waiting for when the Prime Minister breaks his silence and he is waiting for his answer on the question that the accused of murder and rape should be sent to the state Why are governments trying to save? mantriyon ko bhi bolnaa padaabadhate dabaav kaa asar he ki do din pehle tak is ghatana par bolne se bachane vaale modi sarkaar ke mantri bhi ab iske khilaaf bayaan de rahe hai
 On Friday, Home Minister Rajnath Singh broke his silence on the matter and said that the victim's family should get justice
 mahila or bal vikaas mantri menka gandhi ne to ek video sandesh ke jariye kaha ki unka mantralay 12 saal se kam umr kii bacchiyon se balaatkaar ke liye faansee kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan karne ke liye kanoon main badlaav kaa prastaav cabinet ke saamne le jayega
 Apna Dal leader and minister in the Modi government, Anupriya Patel also supported Maneka Gandhi, saying that those who commit hate crimes like rape of children in this way can only be compared to an animal and a demon
 unhone kaha ki aise logon ke man main kanoon kaa dar tabhi baithegaa, jab iske liye kadi se kadi sajaa kaa praavdhaan hoga jisamen faansee shaamil he
 She said that the change in the Poxo Act has to be decided by the concerned ministry but as a woman minister she fully supports it
 uma bharti ne bhi kaha ki unnav or kathua donon jagahon par doshiyon ko sajaa mil kar rahegi
 In Amethi, Smriti Irani said that earlier Rahul Gandhi was standing with Gayatri Prajapati, accused of rape, but now it is his compulsion to take out candil marches
 kathua ke maamle par sabase pehle bolne vaale mantriyon main wike singh the jinhone kaha tha ki is ghatana se wo itane dukhi hai ki insaan hona ek gaali jaisaa lagane laga he
 One reason for the stance of the ministers of the government is also that the courts have shown tough attitude in both Unnao and Kathua cases
 kathua ke maamle par jammu main vakeelon ke ravaiye par kadi aapatti jataate hue supreme court ne kaha ki wo nyaay kii raah main baadha nahin ban sakate
 At the same time, Allahabad High Court reprimanded the state government for not arresting the accused MLA in Unnao's case

 England beat Team India by 266 runs in the Southampton Test
 england dwaara die gaye 445 ranon ke vishaal score ke saamne team india kii ballebaaji dharashayi ho gai or puri team keval 178 ran ke kul yoga par pavilion laut gai
 With the loss in this match, both the teams are tied 1-1 in the 5 Test series
 pankaj singh ke rup main bharat ko aakhri jhatka laga
 Pankaj was also played by Moin Ali
 pankaj ne 9 ran banaae
 If you look at both innings, the bowling of James Anderson and Moin Ali contributed to England's victory
 anderson ne jahaan donon pariyon main 7 wicket chatkaaye vahiin ali ke naam 8 wicket rahe
 Ali ensured his team's victory by walking 6 Indian batsmen in the second innings
 england kii sarajameen par ran ke aadhaar par yah bharat kii badi shikast main se ek he lekin yah unki sabase kharaab haar nahin he
 He was defeated by a mammoth score of 319 runs in a Test match in Nottingham during the last tour in 2011
 england ke liye is jeet kaa matlab he ki usne ashes siries ke baad se 10 test maichon main ek bhi match nahin jeetne kii niraashajanak lay tod di he
 At the same time, the humiliation for India in this defeat was that the caretaker off-spinner Moin Ali destroyed the lower order and was 20 in the best performance of his career
 4 over main 67 ran dekar chah wicket praapt kiye
 Fast bowler Jimmy Anderson gave the first blow in the morning when he got Rohit Sharma (06) caught by wicketkeeper Jose Butler on the ball going out
 mahendra singh dhoni (06) pehali pari jaisaa jajba nahin dikhaa sake or vah ek baar phir outswinger kaa shikaar hue or balla chuaakar wicketiper ko kaich dekar pavilion pahunche
 Ajinkya Rahane (52 not out) was the only player who stood at one end, but could not do much as the series of consecutive wickets continued at the other end
 england ke liye ali lay main aa gayi, unhone gend ko turn karaayaa or clasical of brake gendbaaji kii
 He bowled Ravindra Jadeja (15) and uprooted his off stump
 bhubaneshwar kumaar aisi gend par kaich out hue jo pich karne ke baad spin kar rahi thi, unka kaich anderson ne lapka
 Ali's five wickets were completed with the dismissal of Mohammed Shami, whom he sent to the pavilion at the off break
 rahane ne is dauraan match main apana doosraa ardhashatak puraa kiya, unhone kris vokes kii gend par shandaar squaire driver se 50 ran puure kiye
 Then number 11 batsman Pankaj Singh was present with him
 lekin ali ne jald hi pankaj ko out kar apana chatha wicket praapt kiya
 Now both teams will leave for Manchester for the fourth cricket Test where the match will begin at Old Trafford from 7 August
 bharat ne antim din apane aakhri chah wicket mahaj 66 ran ke andar 24
 Lost in 4 overs
 ali ne chaar wicket 22 gend ke andar 17 ran dekar hasil kiye, unhone chauthe din cheteshwar pujaara or viraat kohli ke wicket jatke the
 Rahane remained unbeaten on 52 off 121 balls with seven fours, making him the only batsman to have batted moderately during this disappointing performance by India
 james anderson ko aisi pich par match main shandaar pradarshan kar 77 ran par saat wicket chatakaane ke liye phir main of da match chunaa gaya jo tej or swing gendbaaji ke liye bilkul bhi mufeed nahin thi
 He will have a hearing before the ICC tomorrow for an alleged clash with Ravindra Jadeja
 stuart broad (22 ran dekar koi wicket nahin), kris jordan (22 ran dekar koi wicket nahin), kris vokes (23 ran dekar koi wicket nahin) ko bhale hi wicket nahin mila ho lekin unhone nishchit rup se bhartiya ballebaajon par dabaav banaaye rakhaa
 a partnership was formed for India only once on the final day when Rahane and Jadeja shared a 32-run partnership for the seventh wicket
 isse bhartiya team ne 59wein over main 150 ran ke aankade ko paar kiya, haalanki yah score tab koi myne nahin rakhata
 Ali then went on to bowl and he destroyed the lower order
 dhoni ke liye unke mukhya spinner ravindra jadeja kaa pradarshan chintaa kaa vishay ho saktaa he jinke teen test maichon main 106
 With a strike rate of 8 (around 18 overs), there are only eight wickets, while Ali is also not the England frontline spinner and is second behind Anderson by 15 wickets
 pichley do varshon main bhartiya ballebaaji ke mukhya khilaadi kohli is maujuuda daure main sabase badi niraashaaon main ek rahe hai, abhi tak unhone chah puri pariyon main keval 101 ran jutaye hai or unka sarvshereshth score 39 ran kaa rahaa he
 Test specialist Cheteshwar Pujara's performance has been slightly better than him, adding 190 runs in six innings including a half-century in the second innings
 baayen haath ke salaami ballebaaj shikhar dhawan ke liye samay bitta ja rahaa he, jinhone 122 ran jutaaye hai
 Ishant Sharma will also not be available for the fourth Test, so captain Dhoni will definitely have to think a lot in terms of choosing the playing XI

 From Kashmir to many states of South India, the IS has made every effort to establish its roots

 At the same time, dozens of Indian youth are constantly fighting war with foreign forces in Iraq and Syria to maintain the Sultanate of IS
 IS ke teror blue-print se jude jo dastavej 'india today group' ke haath lage hai, unase saaf hota he ki IS kashmir ghati main yuvaaon ko apane saath jodate hue apane kutsit gemplan ko amali jama pehanaane kii koshish main juta he

 aap pichley kai saalon se ek rishte main hai
 You share everything with your partner
 chaahe bistar par pyaar bhare pal hon yaa phir kisi park main bitaayen sukun ke do pal, aap donon main hi unhen baraabar bhaawanaaon se sneh dete hai
 But has it ever happened that someday you want to lavish love on them and they get away from you by answering 'not today'
 shuruyaat main ye halaat bahut kam hote hai, lekin uske baad aksar bistar bina silveton ke hi aahen bhar letaa he
 If your partner often refuses to love, do not get frustrated or find flaws in yourself
 iske peeche koi or vajah bhi ho sakati he, isliye hataash hone kii bajaae talaashen ki aakhir baat kya he
 Some things that are natural, we tell you
 diabetes bhi ho saktaa he vajahshayad aap is baat se anjaan hon, lekin diabetes bhi aapaki saathi main pyaar karne ke prati udaseenta kii ek vajah ho saktaa he, isliye jald se jald apane vyast jivan se samay nikaal kar unka diabetes level test kara len
 High blood sugar hinders women from reaching the climax, which causes them to cut you off at bedtime without losing love with you
 darrsal, hakeekat to yah he ki diabetes hone ke baad mahilaon ke liye pyaar ke wo pal suhane nahin, dardanaak ban jate hai
 Imbalance in hormones Women have to face hormonal changes at many stages of their age
 kai badlaav mahilaon ko udasin bana dete hai
 If these changes are wrong rather than right, then any woman can get away from those moments in the bed, which gives them a wonderful experience
 tanaav se rahen durbahut zyada tanaav aapke rishte ko bistar par hi nahin, usase pare bhi prabhavit kar saktaa he, isliye is baat kaa puraa dhyaan rakhen ki aapaki saathi kisi bhi tarah ke tanaav main zyada lambey samay tak na chali jaaen

 Political analysts believe that the verdict is perhaps an indirect indication of the governors appointed by the UPA government to step down or face expulsion
 naye rajyapal ke taur par uttar pradesh vidhansabha ke purv adhyaksh keshari nath treepathi, purv kendriya mantri ram nike, lakhanu ke purv saansad lalji tandon, bhopal ke purv saansad kailash joshi, kerala ke bijepi netaa o rajagopal or shanta kumaar ke naamon par charchaa chal rahi he
 Five governors have resigned after changing the government at the center while two have ended their terms last month

 The Army often shares the works of Indian writers on its social media sites
 pulavama main 14 farvari ko kendriya surakshabal ke javaanon par hamale ke jawaab main aaj subah jab bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan main ghuskar 21 minute kaa oparation chalaaya

 com / buv1dmenkl — ADG PI - INDIAN ARMY (@adgpi) February 26, 2019 For readers of Sahitya Aaj Tak, Dinkar's poem titled 'shakti aur pardon' should be a complete part of the poem
 only that
 atyaachaar sahan karne kakufal yahi hota he,paurush kaa aatak manujkomal ho kar khota he
 Pardon Shobhati to the Bhujang, who has Garal
 usko kya, jo dantaheen,vishrahit, vineet, saral ho?teen diwas tak path maangateraghupati sindhu-kinare,baithe padhate rahe chaninunay ke pyaare-pyaare
 In the north, when a sound was not raised from the ocean, the impatient fireman rose from the body of Ram
 sindhu deh dhar "traahi-traahi"karata aa gira sharan main,charan pooj, daastaa grahan kii,bandhaa mudh bandhan main
 To tell the truth, happiness prevails in the city, in the same respect that the power of victory wins
 sahansheel kshamaa, dayaa kotbhi puujata jag he,bal kaa darp chamakta uskepiche jab jagamag he
 Where there is no power of levity, forgiveness is fruitless garal-ghunt pi jane kamis he, vaani kaa chal he
 Falak hiding the cover of forgiveness, who knows his cowardice, what will he know about the ignorance - Prannar's masculine dependence? What is that unbearable anal in a male, which is a force that rises from the heart to the touch? (summer is blasphemous) chunavi ranneetikaraprashanth kishorane apni chunavi raajnneetik pari kaa aagaaj janata dal united (jadyu) se kiya he
 So far Prashant Kishore, who has worked as an election campaign for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP President Amit Shah and Congress President Rahul Gandhi, chose a regional party for his political launch? This is a big question
 kyonki yadi ve chaahate to kisi rashtriya dal se bhi yah shuruyaat kar sakate the
 Actually, the answer lies in this question itself
 2012 ke gujarat vidhansabha chunaav se lekar 2014 ke aam chunaavon mennarendra modike prachaar abhiyaan kaa ahm hissaa rahe prashanth kishor kii mahatvakanksha thi ki modi sarkaar ke gathan ke baad sarkaar ke nitigat faislon main unki bhoomika rahe
 But after differences with party president Amit Shah over the issue, Kishore changed his course and then joined Nitish Kumar, a staunch opponent of Modi
 vahiin congress ke saath bhi upi or punjab main kaam karne ke baavjood party ke netaaon ne unhen swatantra hokar kaam nahin karne diya
 Prashant is comfortable with Nitish because Nitish, like Prashant, has shown that he will not be averse to working with both Congress and BJP if the opportunity arises
 nitish kumaar 2013 main modi virodh ke naam par endie kaa saath chhodte hue lalu yadav or congress ke saath jud gaye or sangh mukt bharat kii baat karne lage
 Overnight, leaving the RJD and the Congress, joined the BJP again and joined the NDA
 haal hi main hyderabad ke indian bijness skool main ek kaarykram main prashanth kishor ne kaha tha ki ve congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah donon ke sampark main hai
 In this program, he flatly refused to enter any kind of party politics
 lekin ek hafte baad hi prashanth kishor nagediuka daaman tham sabhi ko chaunkaa diya
 But what is the politician whose heart is spoken
 isi tarah kaa nirbaddh lacheelaapan prashanth kishor ko nitish kumaar ke zyada kareeb karata he
 Just as a Lohiaite Nitish Kumar is comfortable with both Congress and BJP, in the same way Prashant Kishore also does not like to be tied to any kind of commitment
 iske saath hi congress or bijepi sareekhe bade dalon main unhen wo swatantraaa nahin milti
 Nitish Kumar is the only one who is in JDU
 nitish kaa vishwaas praapt karne ke baad prashanth kishor ke saamne party main koi chunauti nahin he
 After joining JDU, Prashant has made his presence in the NDA camp
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki antat: prashanth kishor 2019 main narendra modi ke liye prachaar karte dikhenge
 But considering the past few incidents, both Nitish and Prashant Kishore have also shown their political cleverness when the opportunity arises
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki jediu main prashanth kishor kii hiprophile entry ne party ke andar raajnneetik mahatvakanksha rakhane vaale netaaon or hyrarki (padanukram) par prashn khadaa kiya he
 There is also excitement in the party that Prashant will infuse new energy into JDU
 prashanth kishor bhi mahaj jediu netaa ke taur par simit rahen aisi unki manshaa nahin hogi, kyonki apane kad se bada bidaa uthaane ke liye hi ab tak unhen janaa jaataa rahaa he
 In conversation with Aaj Tak, Nitish Kumar sees a future in Prashant Kishore
 lekin mandal kii raajnneeti se prarit bihar main aane vaale samay main prashanth kishor, jo ek brahman hai, ko badi chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 Because no Brahmin reached the political peak after 1989 in Bihar since the politics of ethnic identity dominated

 Actually our PM lives on Race Course Road but BJP MP and NDMC member Meenakshi Lekhi had earlier proposed to name this road 'ekatam Marg' in NDMC
 lekin meeting main aakar unhone apana prastaav badla or lok kalyaan maarg rakhane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 CM Kejriwal, who is presiding over the meeting, proposed to name this road as Shri Guru Gobind Singh Marg
 bahumat bijepi ke paksh main tha isliye sarvasammati se is sadak kaa naam lok kalyaan maarg rakhane kaa faisla hua
 Arvind Kejriwal said that 'meenakshi ji proposed that the race course road should be named as Lok Kalyan Marg
 mere paas bhi sikh sanghathan aaye the or unka naam guru gobind singh ji ke naam par rakhaa, ye maang kar rahe the kyonki ye unka 350waan prakashotsav he
 But when it was discussed, the majority was on the idea that it should be named Lok Kalyan Marg
 ' tippaniyan Meenakshi Lekhi said that earlier our proposal was that because the Race Course Road cannot be the ideal address for PM, it should be renamed to Integral Road
 lekin media main khabar aane ke baad logon ke suzav aaye or pramukh suzav tha ki piem nivas kaa pataa lok kalyaan maarg hona chahie to hamane lok kalyaan maarg rakhane kaa prastaav rakhaa

 The BJP had to step back a bit and bring in another name which was accepted
 darasal hamaare piem res course road par rahete hai lekin bijepi saansad or endiemasi sadsy minakshi lekhi ne pehle endiemasi main is sadak kaa naam 'ekatm maarg' rakhane kaa prastaav diya tha
 But after coming to the meeting, he changed his proposal and proposed to keep the public welfare route
 baithak kii adhyakshata kar rahe siem kejariwal ne is sadak kaa naam shri guru gobind singh maarg rakhane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 The majority was in favor of the BJP, so it was unanimously decided to name the road as Lok Kalyan Marg
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki 'minakshi ji ne prastaav rakhaa ki res course road kaa naam lok kalyaan maarg rakhaa jaae
 i too came to Sikh organizations and named them after Guru Gobind Singh ji, demanding that this is his 350th Prakashotsav
 lekin jab charchaa sabaki hui to bahumat is baat par tha ki iskaa naam lok kalyaan maarg rakhaa jaae
 Comments minakshi lekhi ne kaha ki 'pehle hamaara prastaav tha ki kyonki res course road piem ke liye adarsh pataa nahin ho saktaa isaliye iskaa naam badalakar ekatm maarg kiya jaae
 But after the news came in the media, the suggestions of the people came and the main suggestion was that the address of PM Niwas should be the public welfare route, then we proposed to keep the public welfare route
 ' By the way, it is believed that despite the manner in which Kejriwal's name and the proposed proposal, BJP could not get the name of the road associated with Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya's principle of 'integral Humanism'

 Many children fell ill after consuming medicine in schools
 bacchon ko alag-alag aspataalon main le jaaya gaya
 On April 16, children from all government schools and anganwadi centers were given medicines to kill stomach worms by the Delhi government
 sarkaar ne nirdesh die the ki sabhi sarkari skulon or anganbari kendron main 16 se 20 april ke bich dawa khilaai jaae
 On April 16 at the Senior Secondary School in Burari, North Delhi, the children were fed the medicine for stomach worms, but as soon as the children ate the medicine, suddenly their health started deteriorating
 phir kya tha, bacchon ko ambulance se dilli ke sanjay gandhi aspataal or babu jagjivan ram aspataal le jaaya gaya
 Many schools had the same situation
 kisi-kisi skool se 8-10 kii taadaad main bachche aspataal pahunchane lage
 When one such girl, Mansi, was asked about this, she told that it started to itch after eating the medicine and her stomach started to ache
 dilli sarkaar kaa naaraa he, 'pet ke keedon se mukti or bacchon ko shakti', lekin ye dawa khaane se kai skulon ke bachche biimaar pad rahe hai
 Now the question arises whether there is a deficiency in medicine or there is something else? When such a large number of children have fallen ill on 16 April, what will happen by 20 April? karnataka main kisaanon kaa gussa phuta he
 They are in the mood for a fight with the government
 pradesh main kisaan sanghathanon ne ghoshnaa kii he ki ve har jile main aaj haive jam karenge
 Farmers say that the government has consistently ignored the farmers
 kisaanon kii jameen kaa adhigrahan to kiya ja rahaa he, lekin unke punarvaas par dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa he
 The government's land acquisition policy is not in the interest of farmers
 sarkaar jameen adhigrahan udyagpatiyon ke hit ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kar rahi he
 What is the demand of farmers? According to the information, farmers coming from different places will gather in Bengaluru
 uske baad ve bommasandra or devanahalli samet kai ilaakon main rashtriya rajmarg ko jam karenge
 Farmers allege that transparency is not being taken in land acquisition
 udyogpatiyon ke hit main jameen adhigrahan kiya ja rahaa he or na to uchit tareeke se kisaanon kaa punarvaas kiya ja rahaa he or na hi uchit muaavja mil rahaa he
 In the name of development in Karnataka, land is being acquired for many projects without the permission of the farmers
 aise main sarkaar kisaanon ke liye uchit muaavja or punarvaas kii vyavastha kare
 The police have also taken a stand in view of the shutdown of the policemen over the highway jam
 police kii koshish he ki kisaanon ke virodh-pradarshan ke kaaran janata kaa janajivan prabhavit nahin ho
 The protests should also be peaceful
 pradesh ke kai ilaakon main baari sankhya main police bal tainaat kiya gaya he taaki pradarshan ke dauraan koi kanoon-vyavastha apane haathon main na le or pradarshan hinsak nahin ho
 The government has been severely accused by the farmers that the authorities have been given excessive powers to acquire land
 aise main bina kisaanon ke saath sahmati bane jameemon kaa adhigrahan kiya ja rahaa he
 Their demand is that the acquisition action should be done only after the consent of the officials with the farmers before the land acquisition

 Karan Johar, who has made revelations to others through his chat show, himself is making revelations in interviews
 haal hi main unhone apni film i dil he mushkil se judaa ek aisa raaj kholaa ki soshal media par bavaal much gaya
 Karan told that Anushka Sharma's character in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil had to die in the film because it was her punishment for not loving Ranbir's character
 bataa den ki i dil he mushkil van sided lav kii kahani he
 Ayan (ranbir Kapoor) loves Eliz (anushka), but Elij does not feel the same feeling for Ayan
 vah cancer se mar jaati he
 Karan tells the story behind his death

 @karanjoharsaid this during an interview, about a female character that he killed off:“he loved her so crazily
 She could've loved him back, why couldn't she? So she got cancer and she died
 "ladies, don't DARE to reject men
 You'll get cancer and you'll die
 😁 # nomeansno— Preeti (@preetideshpa)january 25, 2019karan Johar saying he killed Anushka in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil to punish her is the most unsurprising and fucked up thing I've read today

 com / 3ezeplve7v — Sonia Mariam Thomas (@sokneeoh) January 24, 2019 constantly attacked or killed for not reciprocating feelings and we are NOT going to romanticize that— sai (@ Saisailu97) January 24, 2019 People are (unfortunately) VERY influenced by movies and copy the things they see on screen
 This absolutely vile justification of a woman dying because she didn’t love a man would do nothing but encourage men in real life to act the same
 - sai (@ Saisailu97) January 24, 2019I always found Karan Johar weird but his recent interview states that he is not just that but crazy and full of himself! Killing a character just coz she didn't love the male lead back ?! And it's all coming from a personal experience ?? Kya dimaag hai bhai— -jas- (@jasisamess) January 25, 2019 Karan said in an interview - The film's last track got a mixed response
 lekin mujhe lagata he ki anoushka ke kirdaar ko maranaa tha, vah ayaan ko pyaar nahin karti he
 i wrote this character
 ayaan use duubakar pyaar karata he, lekin use badale main vah pyaar nahin miltaa
 Therefore, as a punishment, he had to die due to cancer
 is kirdaar ko lekar karan kaa jawaab darshakon ko pasand nahin aayaa
 One user wrote that she had to die because she did not love him
 auraton kisi purush ko riject karne kii himmat mat karnaa
 Otherwise you will get cancer and you will die
 ek anya ne likhaa he- isliye karan ne apane kairactor ko maaraa kyonki vah badale main ek purush ko pyaar nahin karti thi
 It all comes from the experience of personal life, what is the mind
 bataa den ki pichley dinon karan johar apane chat sho ke kaaran bhi vivaadon main rahe

 You have to pay 30 rupees per minute
 free colling ke alaava customers ko ek maheene tak analimited 2G data milegaa

 They are also domesticated and it is not known that these lizards have medicinal value

 Though the WCCB does not have any data on how big the trafficking business is of these animals, but if we look at the online sales, it is found that for an adult Tokay Gecko, the buyer is 20 lakh

 According to thriving business agencies, some places are "special centers of wildlife trading" and smuggling is rampant here

 "gaya and Varanasi are the main centers of fauna smuggling, where the business takes place under the guise of religious tourism," an official of Delhi's IGI Airport tells of smugglers
 ’’ interpol ne wildlife krime varking group banaaya he, jisamen is tarah ke aparaadhon ke duniyabar ke visheshgy jaanchakarta die gaye project par kaam karte hai
 The biggest problem for online trafficking agencies is that websites do not take responsibility for the goods sold through them
 kai baar websiton par chhipakali tokaay geko ko beche jate dekha ja saktaa he
 Still the seller of it is not known
 is avaidh kaarobaar ko rokane main police ke haath isliye bhi bandhe hai kyonki gharelu chote jeevon kii taskari kii rokthaam ke liye koi kanoon hi nahin he
 To rectify this deficiency, the WCCB has proposed amendments to the Wildlife (protection) Act
 sibiai nideshak ranjit sinha ne india today ko bataaya, ‘‘philhal vanyajeevon ke saath hue aparaadhon ke maamle shikaayat ke taur par darj kiye jate hai or isliye nyaay milane main deree hoti he
 The current law needs to be amended to protect wildlife
 ’’ in maamalon main sibiai jaanch ke liye keval teen rajyon ne apni sahmati di he
 If all states give their consent, CBI can deal with such crimes much better
 ek van adhikari kehete hai ki aparaadh ke liye jurmaana bharne ke niyam ke chalate bhi kai taskar or courier dand se batch jate hai
 The Wildlife Act provides, "upon payment of the fixed amount of the Wildlife Authority, the suspect, who is in custody, should be released and no action should be taken against the person in this case
" ’’ airport par kuch aisa hi hota he jab koi vyakti kachhuon se bhare bag ke saath pakadaa jaataa he
 Concerned with the increasing cases of online trafficking, the Wildlife Authority has recently directed the police not to wait for a case to be registered by the Wildlife Authority if a case of wildlife smuggling comes up, but to act promptly on its behalf in such crimes Start it

 Microsoft founder Bill Gates currently has a net worth of $ 95 billion

 Or maybe even longer

 Neelkanth Mishra growth rate is slowing down, along with most of the macro-economic parameters are seeing a sharp decline: growth, treasury, inflation, currency, banking etc
 rajkoshiya maamle main dekha jaae to abhi yah spasht nahin he ki kya jiesti kii daren vaazib rup se tay kii gai hai
 Even the GST Council will not know this before the September and October collections (which will be known till the end of November)
 agar daren bahut zyada rahi hongi to sarkaar ko zyada kar milegaa or vah rajkoshiya boj ke taur par kaam karegaa or yadi daren kam rakhi gai hongi (jisaki sambhaavna bahut kam he) to vah rajkoshiya utprerak ke taur par kaam karegaa
 This will make it more difficult to estimate than usual

 Analysts' forecasts have come down significantly since the first quarter figures and most estimates are around 6 for the entire year

 Ashima Goyal: Most recent figures are showing signs of improvement but the annual growth rate has fallen to 6
 5 fisadi tak ho sakati he
 Dharmakirti Joshi: We are sure that the decline in the growth rate in the first quarter is transitional and as demonetisation and pre-gst distilling will have a mild effect and positive efficiency gains of GST will start showing, the economy will be back in the next few quarters
 Will climb upwards

 Rohini Somanathan It depends on what kind of suffering we are talking about

 The long-term impact will be based on the sectors that were most affected by this shock to the economy
 agar kuch khaas utpaadon kii maang na hone ke kaaran kuch udyogon ko band karnaa padataa he or agar inako kahin or mauka nahin miltaa he to unki takalif kaaphi lambii chalegi
 This impact is serious for all the goals of the economy, such as how it will help traditional industries and small scale industries in rural areas
 bharat ko vikaas ke raste par phir se lautaane ke liye aapke kya suzav hai?pranab sekhsamaanya sthitiyon ke liye asaamaanya samaadhaan bhi chahie hote hai
 We are aware that the demand side has suffered significantly, partly due to demonetisation and partly from the competition on the import front due to the strong rupee

 Two things should be done immediately: (1) There is a huge increase in public spending, especially in investment in rural areas, even if it does not mean violating FRBM (fiscal responsibility and budget management) targets
 or, (2) yaa to mudra bazaar main yaa phir sampatti bazaar main dakhal ke jariye rupye kaa avamulyan prabandhit kiya jaae
 i realize that the rating agencies will defy both these suggestions and may even lower India's rating and i think it will also have the desired effect

 ham aapako bataa rahen hai yahaan par kuch aise tips jinaki madad se aap in pareshaaniyon se batch sakati hai- The matter of cleaning the Ganges is in discussion these days
 ganga punaruddhar mantralay se india today ko artiai ke jariye mili jawaab se saamne aayaa he ki varanasi ke ghaaton par ganga main pradooshan pehle kii tulana main bad gaya he
 In Varanasi, fecal coliform bacteria count was found to increase by 58 percent in the Ganges water
 ye report aane ke baad patna main ganga or ghaaton kii kya sthiti he, ye jaanane ke liye india today ne ground jiro par jaakar jamini hakeekat kaa jayja liya
 Heading towards the Ganges River, 7 km from the center of Patna city, this reporter's words were echoed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi four years ago to clean the Ganges
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bhi aksar ganga ko 'nirmal' or 'aviral' banane par jor dete rahete hai
 Also read: Modi @ 4: Uma went - Gadkari came, even till the cleaning of the ghats, Nirmal Ganga wants to have a dream, Nirmal Ganganitishachahe first stayed in the grand alliance with the RJD and Congress or he had an alliance with the BJP, he has many times Ganga Have expressed concern over reaching the verge of extinction in Patna
 nitish ne haal main ganga kii badahaali kaa zikr karte hue baxur main nadi main chah maheene tak ek pot ke fanse rahane kaa bhi hawala diya
 Due to the water being only one meter deep there, it was not possible for the vessel to move forward
 idia today reporter ne anta ghat kaa rukh kiya to 100 meter pehle hi bheeshan durgandh kii vajah se naak par roomaal rakhana padaa
 As soon as we reached the ghat, the bad smell was out of tolerance and felt like a vomiting
 reporter ne ye jaanane kii koshish kii itani durgandh kahaan se aa rahi he
 As soon as you looked left at the Anta Ghat, the secret of foul smell was revealed
 ganga main mila rahaa gater kaa panivahaan badi maatra main gater kaa ganda pani ghat kii disha main aata dikhaai diya
 Does this water get all mixed up with all the waste? Talking about Kanpur in UP, the industrial waste coming from the leather factories with the water of drains to pollute the Ganga is considered the most responsible, but there is no such factory in Patna
 patna main audyogic kachare kii tulana main gharon se aane vaala sivej kaa pani hi ganga ko pradooshit karne ke liye doshi he
 India Today reporter reached Kali Ghat in pursuit of sewage water
 kaali ghat kii anta ghat se duuri 200 meter he
 Eventually the reporter reached the spot at Kali Ghat where a large sewage sewer was mixing in the Ganges water
 kachare se ata padaa he anta ghaghanta ghat ho yaa kaali ghat, har jagah bina treet kiya hua or rasinic kachra dekha ja saktaa he
 The polythene packets filled with garbage from the houses itself were describing the plight of the Ganges
 sivej kaa pani jab naale ke jariye ganga main samaa jaataa he to nadi ke pani kaa rang kaisaa ho jaataa he, ye jaanane ke liye ek bottle dubo kar pani bharaa gaya
 It was surprising to the reporter that the water color was black
 is pani ke kisi tarah ke istemaal kii baat to dur isamen dubkee lagaana bhi kitna asurakshit he, kisi ke liye ye andaaj lagaana mushkil nahin he
 Seeing the condition of the Ganges ghats in Patna, the question arises that when the crores of rupees are being spent for cleaning the Ganges, when will the correct result come out? sansad main mangalvaar ko pesh rail bajet kii sattadhari congress or kendriya mantriyon ne 'saraahneey' kahkar prashansa kii to bhaajapa ne ise 'niraashajanak' kahkar nakaar diya

 Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party's National Convenor Arvind Kejriwal is upset with the mlas of his own party as they are not meeting the public despite his saying
 isse party kii chhavi lagaataar kharaab ho rahi he
 Kejriwal has written a letter to all his mlas, stating that "in the last Legislative Party meeting, we had decided that all the mlas would be available in their offices every morning to meet the public
" 'kuch' vidhayakon ko chhod sabhi ne iskaa paalan karnaa shuru kar diya he
 i hope the rest of the mlas will also implement it soon
 '' Not only this, Kejriwal has further written that "people of some areas complain that their mlas never come to meet them
 party kii sarkaar ke kaam kii chaaron taraf saraahna he lekin janata us vidhayak se bhi milanaa chaahati hai jise usne vot dekar jitayaa he
 " kejariwal kii is baat se pataa chalata he ki party ke vidhayak or janata main duuri he jiskaa khamiyaja party uthaa rahi he or vidhayak kehane ke baad main janata se nahi jud paa rahe hai
 This is the reason why Kejriwal has sought a plan from his mlas and said that the MLA should give full details of which area in the assembly constituency on which day
 yahi nahin siem kejariwal ne dilli ke mukhya sachiv ko chitthee likhakar kaha he ki maine nirdesh diya tha ki sabhi afasar apane daftar main bina appointment janata se roj milenge jabaki mujhe pataa chalaa he ki bahut se afasar iskaa paalan nahin kar rahe

 is number par aane vaali shikayaton kii jaankaree mujhe di jaae or mukhya sachiv in shikayaton par karrwai karen
 In fact, after the Delhi Municipal Corporation elections, the Aam Aadmi Party found that its mass base decreased due to increasing distance from the general public
 isliye kejariwal ne apane sabhi mantriyon, vidhayakon, afasaron ko roj subah aam janata se bina appointment milakar unki samasya kaa samaadhaan karne kaa aadesh diya
 But the legislators and officers themselves are engaged in implementing this scheme or say its wind
 kejariwal ne apane sabhi vidhayakon ko chitthee likhakar kaha he ki "pichhali vidhayak dal meeting main hamane tay kiya tha ki sabhi vidhayak roj subah janata se milane ke liye apane daftar main uplabdh rahenge
 All except a 'few' mlas have started following it
 main ummid karata hum baaki vidhayak bhi ise jald lagu karenge
 '' yahi nahin kejariwal ne aage likhaa he ki "kuch kshetron ke logon kii shikaayat he ki unke vidhayak unase kabhi milane nahin aae
 The work of the party's government is widely appreciated, but the public also wants to meet the MLA whom he has voted to win
 " Kejriwal's point shows that there is a distance between the party's MLA and the public, which is being borne by the party and the MLA is unable to connect with the public later
 yahi kaaran he ki kejariwal ne apane vidhayakon se plan maanga he or kaha he ki vidhayak vidhansabha kshetra main kis ilaake main kis din jayega iskaa puraa byora den
 Not only this, CM Kejriwal has written a letter to the Chief Secretary of Delhi, saying that i had instructed that all officers will meet the public daily without appointment in their office, whereas i have come to know that many officers are not following it
 mukhya sachiv kadi chetavanee jari karen ki jo afasar in nirdeshon kaa ulanghan karegaa us par kadi anushaasanamak karrwai hogi
 The comments kejariwal ne mukhya sachiv mem kutti ko baqayada afasaron ke daftar ke baahar board lagaakar yah bataane ko kaha he ki yah afasar roj subah 10-11 baje bina appointment janata se milegaa or nahin milane par is number par shikaayat karen
 i should be informed about the complaints coming on this number and the Chief Secretary should take action on these complaints
 darasal aam aadmi party ne dilli nagar nigam chunaav ke baad yah paaya ki aam janata se uski duuri badhane ke chalate uskaa janaadhar ghat gaya
 Therefore, Kejriwal ordered all his ministers, mlas, officers to meet the general public every morning without any appointment and solve their problem
 lekin is yojana ko lagu karne yaa yun kahen isaki hawa nikaalane main khud vidhayak or afasar lage hue hai
 Not only this, Kejriwal has further written that "people of some areas complain that their mlas never come to meet them
 party kii sarkaar ke kaam kii chaaron taraf saraahna he lekin janata us vidhayak se bhi milanaa chaahati hai jise usne vot dekar jitayaa he
 " kejariwal kii is baat se pataa chalata he ki party ke vidhayak or janata main duuri he jiskaa khamiyaja party uthaa rahi he or vidhayak kehane ke baad main janata se nahi jud paa rahe hai
 This is the reason why Kejriwal has sought a plan from his mlas and said that the MLA should give full details of which area in the assembly constituency on which day
 yahi nahin siem kejariwal ne dilli ke mukhya sachiv ko chitthee likhakar kaha he ki maine nirdesh diya tha ki sabhi afasar apane daftar main bina appointment janata se roj milenge jabaki mujhe pataa chalaa he ki bahut se afasar iskaa paalan nahin kar rahe

 The police is investigating bharat or england ke bich maujuuda test siries main captain viraat kohli team india kii ballebaaji ke centrebindu sabit hone vaale hai
 
 
 This is what i feel after the first day's play in Visakhapatnam
 match ke pehle din viraat ne yaadgaar pari kheli or shuruaati do wicket girane ke baad pujaara ke saath milakar sammanjanak score kii buniyaad rakhi
 Pujara was dismissed after scoring a century but Kohli still remains a headache for English bowlers
 apni 151 ran kii pari main unhone 241 gendon kaa saamana kar 15 chauke lagaae hai
 This is the 14th century in Kohli's career
 kohli jis tarah se apane khel ko 'impruve' kar rahe hai use dekhte hue kaha ja saktaa he ki aasmaan hi unki seemaa he
 In the second innings of the first test, Virat played an important role in avoiding defeat for Team India
 vanade or tii20 main 50 ke upar kaa ballebaaji ausat rakhane vaale kohli yadi isi tarah pradarshan karte rahe to jald hi test cricket main bhi 50+ ke club main honge
 The result of Team India's first two wickets falling within five overs in the second test was that Virat had to bat for the sixth over
 ek tarah se yah sthiti openar kii hi tarah thi
 He faced the fast bowlers full of energy
 tippaniyan The way James Anderson became a problem for Kohli in the series in England, everyone's eyes were on the match between these two cricketers
 pehle din kii baat karen to kaha ja saktaa he ki guuruuvaar ko viraat is mukaable main aage rahe
 The Indian captain faced Anderson without any pressure and did not miss out on aggressive shots against him
 vaise, lunch ke baad viraat ko us samay jeevandaan mila jab ben stokes kii gend par long leg par khadey adil raashid unka kaich nahin pakad paae
 The Indian captain was 56 at that time
 england ke lihaaj se baat karen to uske liye pehle din kii acchhee khabar james anderson kii gendbaaji or aakhri seshan main ajinkya rahane kaa wicket girnaa rahaa
 On the second day of the match, cricket fans will keep an eye on how Virat extends his 151-run unbeaten innings and at what score Team India's first innings ends
 agar team india apana score 450 ke paar pahunchane main kaamyaab rahi to nishchit rup se dabaav captain cook or unki team par hoga

 england main hui siries main james anderson jis tarah se kohli ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab bane the, uske maddenjar har kisi kii najar in donon diggaj cricketron ke mukaable par tiki thi
 Talking about the first day, it can be said that Virat was ahead in this match on Thursday
 bhartiya captain ne bina kisi dabaav ke anderson kaa saamana kiya or unke khilaaf aakraamak shot lagane se bhi nahin chuke
 By the way, after lunch, Virat got a life when Adil Rashid, standing at long leg off Ben Stocks, could not catch his catch
 bhartiya captain us samay 56 ran par the
 Talking about England, the good news for him on the first day was James Anderson's bowling and Ajinkya Rahane's wicket in the last session
 match ke duusare din cricket premiyon kii najar is baat par hogi ki viraat apni 151 ran kii naabad pari ko badhaakar kahaan tak pahunchaate hai or team india kii pehali pari kis score par khatm hoti he
 If Team India managed to get past its 450, then the pressure would definitely be on Captain Cook and his team

 aaj ek acchhee khabar bataata hum, hamaari naukari series kaa asar hua he, thodaa hua he magar gaadi aage badi he
 The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has allotted a state of income tax inspectors
 yani ab 505 ummidavaar dekh sakenge ki unhen kis kis rajya main janaa he
 This process was stuck due to which the appointment letter was delayed
 ab ummid he ki niyukti patr jaldi milane lagegaa
 We have been campaigning continuously since last Monday when 3287 students will get appointment letters, which have been selected for Income Tax Department, Excise and Excise Department
 aaj nahin balki agast 2017 main inkaa riselt aa gaya tha magar das maheene se ye chaatr ghar baithkar baichaiyn ho rahe the
 The mental and financial condition of many started deteriorating
 inhen koi jawaab nahin de rahaa tha magar system par hamaari naukari siries kaa asar padaa he or is vakt jab dilli kii hawa aandhiyon main badal rahi he, 505 noujvaan apane maa baap ke saath gale mil rahe honge, rishtedaaron ko phone kar rahe honge
 But we want to be happy for everyone, hopefully the remaining 2,782 youth will also get the appointment letter and the allotment of the zone till next week when we review the matter again in the job series on Monday
 isi sibiditi main 1,114 iskar sahaayakon ke bhi zone aavantit kar die hai
 Appointment of 855 officers of Excise Department has not been reported
 baharhaal jin 505 chaatro kii suchi ai he, unki khushi kaa thikaana nahin he or baaki ko bhi ummid hone lagi he
 At the same time, my trouble will increase that to raise my case in prime time, the crowd of people will increase, the effect of which is that i am not able to live up to everyone's expectations
 kai log naaraaz bhi ho jate hai magar aap aaj wo sab chhodkar ye dekhie ki das maheene se kaam nahin ho rahaa tha, prime time ke kaaran ho gaya
 There are many who left the job and many for whom one day is overshadowed
 aap darshakon ko bataate hue khushi ho rahi he ki sibiditi ke 505 naujavaanon kaa zone alot ho gaya he
 Karan Gupta has got Nagpur, Visakha has got Mumbai zone
 radha raman ko kochi, ajay singh ko chandigarh, prasoon pankaj ko patna mila he
 We were adamant since last Monday that these students should get a zone and get appointment letters
 is kadi main 3287 noujvaan niyukti patr kaa intazaar kar rahe hai magar inamen se aaj 505 naujavaanon kii gaadi aage bad gai he
 CBDT Central Board AAP Direct Taxes has put a list of 505 Income Tax Inspectors on its website
 ek baar jone alot ho jane se niyukti patr milane kii prakriya kuch hi dinon kii baat rah jaati he
 This young man was saddened before the listing on the CBDT website
 uskaa vishwaas hill rahaa tha kyonki gaanvon main log poochne lage the ki jhooth to nahin bolaa tha ki naukari ho gai he
 The success of the prime time job series has been due to the AAP audience
 aapane hindu muslim kaa topic chhod kar media ke sampadakon ke bich neeras maane jane vaale vishay kaa saath nahin diya hota to sarkaar ko hosh nahin aata
 See still, the Ministry of Information Broadcasting has not given appointment letters to more than a hundred youth
 main kab se unki vyathaa uthaa rahaa hum
 Does our government have enmity with its own youth? sibiditi ne 505 inakam tex inspectoron ke zone ke aavanton kii suchi nikaal di he
 In case of 1000 tax assistants, there should also be a boom
 ek chaatr ne mujhe patr likhaa he
 Let us tell you, in February, when our job series was on the upswing, 3287 youth were asked to opt for the zone under its pressure
 naujavaanon ne farm bhar diya magar gaadi ruk gai
 He felt that this anchor of prime time would also get stuck in a Hindu Muslim topic but i returned
 agle hafte tak sabhi 3287 chaatro ko niyukti patr mil janaa chahie
 Can this be expected from Finance Minister Piyush Goyal, tell a story of his second ministry
 yah kahani bataati he ki ham digital india ke maamle main kitni tarakkee kar paae hai
 As soon as the big challenge came, the speed of the Ministry of Railways slowed down
 kya aapako yaad he ki rail mantralay ne kareeb ek lakh padon ke liye pariksha lene kaa elaan kiya tha, uski tazaa sthiti kya he
 The recruitment to which Piyush Goyal was referring to the tsunami in his tweet is where the tsunami is
 16 farvari ke twit main piyush goyal likhte hai ki @piyushgoyal tsunami! bhartiya rail main 90,000 naukariyaan
 Start of Maha Bharathi campaign
 selary se lekar aanwine kaise aavedan karen, sabakuch yaheen se jaane
 @piyushgoyal Indian Railways announces world's largest recruitment campaign
 group si level 1 level 11 shrenee ke 89,409 padon par bharti hogi
 Build a career in Railways and contribute to the new India
 vitt mantri piyush goyal na to 3287 iskar sahaayakon ke haath main niyukti patr dilaa sake na hi jis pariksha ko duniya kaa sabase bada bharti abhiyaan bataa rahe the uski pariksha kii taarikh kaa elaan kar sake hai
 31 March was the last date to fill the form, till 31 May examination was not done
 do maheene baad bhi taarikh kaa elaan nahin hua he
 On 10 February, the Ministry of Railways announced to fill more than 90,000 vacancies
 iske farm bharne kii antim taarikh 31 march thi
 It was said at that time that the exam might be held in april-may, but when the date was not known, then the form-makers started getting restless
 isi bich railway recruitment bort ne 31 may ko ek notice jari kiya he
 It said that this time 2 crore 37 lakh forms have been filled unexpectedly
 aavedan farm kii jaanch chal rahi he or computer aadhaarit pariksha kii taiyaari bhi chal rahi he
 On completion of these tasks, the examination date will be announced on the website
 yah baat sahi he ki 2 karod 37 lakh farm bahut hai magar kya online system main inte farm kii scrootni karne kii kshamta nahin hogi
 Then what did online mean
 kya railway ko pataa nahin ki yah kaam kab tak puraa ho jayega, kya yah acha nahin hota ki pariksha kii taarikh kaa elaan ho jaataa or chaatr nishcint hokar taiyaari karte
 There was a report of the Parliamentary Committee on Railways that more than 2 lakh posts have been vacated but recruitment has been less than one lakh
 uski bhi pariksha kab puri hogi or kab nattejey aaenge or kab niyukti patr milegaa koi nahin jaanata
 Generally, if you take the average of railway examination, then it takes two to three years from the advertisement to the final result
 2019 main koun jitegaa usase zyaada zaruri he ki naujavaanon ko niyukti patr kab milegaa
 Bankers are sad that after so much struggle, their salary and other demands were not paid attention
 bharat ke gramin dak sevakon kii hadtaal 18 din se jari he
 Delivery of letter sheets to post offices has been stopped
 logon ke zaruri kaagazat funs gaye hai phir bhi in hadtaal kaa koi nateeja nahin niklaa he
 The Yogi government promised to give appointment letters to 12460 teachers, said that the appointment letter will be received only in March, but these teachers say that only 4000 teachers have received the appointment letter, the remaining 8000 have come back to the struggle again Huh
 hamaari sarkarein naukari dene ke maamle main saaf saaf kyon nahin kahati hai
 For the next ten days, many villages in the country will remain closed
 kisaan ekta manch ne ek june se 10 june ke liye kisaan karfu kaa elaan kiya he
 This organization consists of 65 farmer organizations
 is dauraan kisaan shaharon ko dugh or sabziyon kii supplai nahin karenge
 They will sell only to villages
 tippaniyan The heart is shaken by watching this video of milk pouring from a tanker on the streets of Maharashtra
 hamaare sahyogi sunil singh ne bataaya he ki ahmednagar main hajaaron dugdh utpaadak tehsil kaa daravaaza kholkar andar ghus gaye
 Their demand is that the minimum price of milk should be Rs 27 per liter
 doodh ke daam girane se kisaan kaaphi pareshaan ho gaye hai
 The milk producers of Punjab also have the same condition
 ve bhi doodh phenk kar apana rosh jataa rahe hai
 There is a report by Quint that in Maharashtra, the daily expenditure on the back of a cow is 300 rupees but the income is not even 200 rupees
 pichley saal june main sarkaar ne kisaanon kii maang maan lee thi or gaay ke doodh kaa daam 24 se badhaakar 27 rupee prati litre kar diya tha lekin sarkari ghoshnaa ke baad bhi koparative ye bhav nahin de rahe hai
 The government is also not taking action
 doodh ke daam ko lekar madhyapradesh or uttar pradesh ke kisaan kaaphi uttejit hai
 In Maharashtra, 2 crore 30 lakh liters of milk is stored every day
 dugdh utpaadakon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar rate tay karti he 27 rupee prati litre magar koparative or dairy vaale 17 rupee prati litre dete hai jo ki bahut kam hai
 Another way would have been to feed poor children instead of throwing milk
 pichley saal kisaan andolan kii shuruuaat tamba gaanv se hui thi vahaan par kisaanon ne sarkaar kii vaadakhilaphi ko lekar samuhik shraadh kiya
 Vegetables were spilled in many places
 kisaan laagat kaa dedh guna daam chaahate hai
 The farmers are not only asking for the price but also the pension
 rajasthan or madhyapradesh main police kii sakriyata dekhi gai
 In SAF, 18 companies of SAF, 5000 additional personnel have been deployed in 18 districts
 in ilaakon main mandsaur golicond ke doshiyon ko sazaa dilvaanaa bhi he
 Farmers in Madhya Pradesh also want relief materials to be distributed immediately in drought-affected areas
 ganne kaa mulya 400 rupee prati quintal diya jaae, kisaanon ko dijal sabsidi di jaae
 Agricultural equipment should be exempted from GST
 yah bahut bada masalaa he kisaanon ke liye unke liye upkaran khareednaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 a demand is interesting and very urgent
 bharat ke har kisaan ko is maang ko lekar ad janaa chahie
 That high-level education and health centers be provided in villages
 magar sarkarein unhen beemaa kaa jhansa de dengi ki ham swasthya beemaa denge, lekin kisaan gaanv main quality kaa aspataal maang rahaa he
 You have seen the result of the issue of sugarcane farmers' dues in UP, but if you go to Agra, potato farmers are broke about the price
 unki pareshaani dur nahin ho saki he
 In prime time itself you saw that pulses farmers of Bihar are not getting the price
 kisaan pareshaan hai
 After all, how long will the farmers keep returning with the agitation of the movement again and again
 inaki samasya kaa samaadhaan kab hoga
 But we want to be happy for everyone, hopefully the remaining 2,782 youth will also get the appointment letter and the allotment of the zone till next week when we review the matter again in the job series on Monday

 The success of the prime time job series has been due to the AAP audience
 aapane hindu muslim kaa topic chhod kar media ke sampadakon ke bich neeras maane jane vaale vishay kaa saath nahin diya hota to sarkaar ko hosh nahin aata
 See still, the Ministry of Information Broadcasting has not given appointment letters to more than a hundred youth
 main kab se unki vyathaa uthaa rahaa hum
 Does our government have enmity with its own youth? sibiditi ne 505 inakam tex inspectoron ke zone ke aavanton kii suchi nikaal di he
 In case of 1000 tax assistants, there should also be a boom
 ek chaatr ne mujhe patr likhaa he
 Let us tell you, in February, when our job series was on the upswing, 3287 youth were asked to opt for the zone under its pressure
 naujavaanon ne farm bhar diya magar gaadi ruk gai
 He felt that this anchor of prime time would also get stuck in a Hindu Muslim topic but i returned
 agle hafte tak sabhi 3287 chaatro ko niyukti patr mil janaa chahie
 Can this be expected from Finance Minister Piyush Goyal, tell a story of his second ministry

 As soon as the big challenge came, the speed of the Ministry of Railways slowed down

 Generally, if you take the average of railway examination, then it takes two to three years from the advertisement to the final result

 Finance Minister Piyush Goyal could neither get appointment letters in the hands of 3287 Income Tax Assistants nor could announce the date of the examination which was said to be the world's largest recruitment drive
 31 march farm bharne kii antim taarikh thi, 31 may tak imtahaan kaa pataa nahin
 The date has not been announced even after two months
 10 farvari ko rail mantralay ne 90,000 se adhik vaikency bharne kaa elaan kiya tha
 The last date to fill its form was 31 March
 us vakt kaha gaya tha ki pariksha april may main ho sakati he magar jab taarikh kaa pataa nahin chalaa tab farm bharne vaale baichaiyn hone lage
 Meanwhile, the Railway Recruitment Bort has issued a notice on 31 May
 usamen kaha ki is baar apratyaashit rup se 2 karod 37 lakh farm bhare gaye hai
 Examination of application form is going on and preparation of computer based examination is also going on
 in kaaryon ke puraa ho jane par website par pariksha kii taarikh kaa elaan ho jayega
 It is true that there are 2 crore 37 lakh forms, but will the online system not have the ability to scrub these forms? phir online kaa matlab kya hua
 Does the Railways not know by when this work will be completed, is it not good that the exam date would have been announced and the students would have been relaxed and prepared
 railway kii sansadeey samiti kii report thi ki 2 lakh se adhik pad khaali hai magar bhartee nikali ek lakh se kuch kam
 No one knows when the examination will be completed and when the results will come and when the appointment letter will be received
 aam taur par railway kii pariksha kaa ausat nikaalenge to vigyaapan nikaalane se lekar antim riselt aane main do se teen saal kaa samay lag jaataa he
 Who will win in 2019 is more important than when the youth will get the appointment letter

 The strike of the Gramin Dak Sevaks of India has been going on for 18 days
 dakgharon main chitthee patri kaa vitaran ruk gaya he
 Necessary documents of people have been stuck, yet no result of these strike has come
 yogi sarkaar ne 12460 shikshakon ko niyukti patr dene kaa vaada kiya tha, kaha tha ki march main hi niyukti patr mil jayega, magar in shikshakon kaa kahana he ki sirf 4000 shikshakon ko hi niyukti patr mila he, baaki 8000 phir se sangharsh par aa gaye hai
 Why our governments do not say clearly in terms of jobs
 agle das dinon tak desh ke kai gaanv band rahenge
 The Kisan Ekta Manch has announced a farmer curfew from June 1 to June 10
 is sanghathan main 65 kisaan sanghathan shaamil hai
 During this time, the farmers will not supply milk and vegetables to the cities
 ve sirf gaanvon ko hi bechenge
 The comments maharashtra kii sadakon par tanker se doodh giraate is video ko dekhakar kalejaa kaanp jaataa he
 Our colleague Sunil Singh has told that thousands of milk producers entered the tehsil's door in Ahmednagar
 unki maang he ki dugh kii nunatam keemat 27 rupee prati litre ho
 Farmers have become very upset due to falling milk prices
 punjab ke dugdh utpaadakon kii bhi vahi haalat he
 They are also expressing their anger by throwing milk
 quint kii ek report he ki maharashtra main ek gaay ke peeche rose kaa kharchaa 300 rupaya he magar aamadani 200 rupee bhi nahin ho paati he
 In June last year, the government accepted the demand of farmers and raised the price of cow's milk from 24 to 27 rupees per liter, but even after the government announcement, cooperatives are not giving these prices
 sarkaar bhi karrwai nahin kar rahi he
 Farmers of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh are very excited about the price of milk
 maharashtra main har din 2 karod 30 lakh litre doodh har din jamaa kiya jaataa he
 Milk producers say that the government fixes the rate at Rs 27 per liter, but the cooperative and dairy farmers pay Rs 17 per liter, which is very low
 ek tarika or ho saktaa tha ki doodh phenkane kii jagah garib bacchon ko hi pilaa dete
 Last year, the peasant movement started from Tamba village, where the farmers performed a collective shraadh on the promise of the government
 kai jagahon par sabziyaan phenk di gayi
 Farmers want one and a half times the cost
 kisaan sirf daam nahin maang rahe balki pension bhi maang rahe hai
 Police activism was seen in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
 madhyapradesh main 18 zilon main eseef kii 18 companiyaan, 5000 atirikt jawan tainaat kiye gaye hai
 Mandsaur firing convicts are also to be punished in these areas
 madhyapradesh main kisaan yah bhi chaahate hai ki sookhaa prabhavit kshetron main raahat saamagree turant banti jaae
 The price of sugarcane should be given at Rs 400 per quintal, diesel subsidy should be given to the farmers

 a post shared bysalman Khan(@beingsalmankhan) onmar 4, 2018 at 7:00am PST Manish Gurjar alias Pappu, a liquor baron, was shot dead in Gurgaon
 manish ko 20 se zyada goliyaan maari gai
 Police suspect that Manish has been murdered due to gang war
 haalanki police ise lutpaat kaa maamla maan kar bhi jaanch kar rahi he
 At the time of the incident, Manish had reached Prem Mandir on Railway Road along with his driver and a friend Liaqat for cash collection on his liquor contract
 usee vakt bike savaar do logon ne manish paratabadatod goliyaanchalaayin
 The bullets also hit Manish's driver and Liaquat
 teenon ko gambhir haalat main medanta le jaaya gaya, jahaan doctoron ne manish ko mrit ghoshit kar diya
 Manish's driver and Liaqat's condition remain critical
 bataa den ki mritak sharaab vyavsaayee manish gangster binder gurjar kaa bada bhai tha
 Binder, who is lodged in jail, is accused of gangster Sandeep Gadhauli for allegedly conducting an encounter with the police
 is maamle main mumbai police jaanch kar rahi he
 Significantly, on September 21, Binder's close gangster Mahesh attack was also roasted in a similar manner
 is maamle main kaushal gang ke ek shooter ko police ne giraftaar kiya tha
 The murder of liquor baron Manish on Monday night is also being linked to the same gang war
 philhal police maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Governments and governments are now beginning to panic on social media
 phir se kashmir or gujarat main kai jilon main internet seva band kii gai he
 There is news of shutting down of Net services in Kupwara, Baramulla, Bandipura and Ganderbal in Kashmir
 gujarat main pichley saal agast ke maheene kii tarah is baar bhi patel andolan ko lekar internet seva band kar di gai he
 Internet service is closed in Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Vadodara, Sabarkantha
 tab to log yah bhi shikaayat karte mili ki police ne kaaphi maaraa-peeta he, unke video ham share na kar saken, isliye internet seva band kii gai he
 Discontinuation of internet service has become like putting Section 144 off the torso
 ab to parikshaon main chori rokane ke liye bhi us dauraan shahar main internet seva band kar di jaati he
 In February, during the examination of the revenue accountant in Gujarat itself, internet service was stopped from 9 am to 1 am so that duplication could not be done
 ye faisle bataa rahe hai ki internet ab mukt akaash nahin rahaa
 a news site called The Wire wrote that in Kashmir, Internet services were shut down for 18 to 25 days in the last four years
 pichley saal hafington post kii ek report ke anusaar bharat main 2013 se 2015 ke bich chaar rajyon main nau baar internet sevaayen band kii gayi
 Apart from Gujarat, Kashmir, internet has stopped in Nagaland and Manipur
 varsh 2011 main Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ne ek anumaan lagaaya tha ki misr main paanch din ke liye internet band kar dene se nau karod dollar kaa nuksaan ho gaya tha
 In 2015, a German organization did a study about the internet shutdown in Pakistan, how it not only attacks freedom of expression, but can also harm national or personal security or business
 bharat main bhi times of india se lekar indian express tak ne likhaa ki gujarat main patel andolan ke pehle charan ke dauraan internet band karne se 30 karod se lekar 7,000 karod tak kaa nuksaan hua
 All of our lives are now connected to the Internet
 sarkaar bhi apane kai kaam ap ke jariye karti he
 From e-commerce, hotels, tourism, all types of businesses are done through the Internet
 aam log bhi ab smartphone par uplabdh net ke jariye jite hai
 There are few reports in the media about how people were troubled by the shutdown of the Internet
 internet ab hawa-pani kii tarah he
 Does the administration stop water supply in a violent situation
 
 
 ? agar aisa he to sarkaar ko bataanaa chahie ki jab kisi kaaran se internet band hoga, tab aap ap ke alaava kahaan jaakar uski suvidhaayen le sakate hai
 The administration fears that the rumors may spread out of control through social media
 kai baar vah apni naakaami ke kisse failane se rokane ke liye bhi band karti hogi
 If rumors continue to spread on social media daily, should Facebook and whatsapp be discontinued every day
 soshal media kaa ubhaar ek aise spes ke rup main hua tha, jahaan log the
 Who were creating a new space and writing their own talks apart from the media and political parties
 ab bataane ki zarurat nahin he ki kis tarah se dalon ne is spes kaa istemaal raajnneetikaran karne main kiya or kis tarah se afvaahen failaane kaa silsilaa aaj bhi jari he
 In this game, the backbone of the supporters and organizations associated with the ruling party is heavy
 inke khilaaf shaayad hi kabhi karrwai hoti he
 Organized abuses, threats are being made and political supporters start playing a game of defamation from whatsapp to Facebook and Twitter for not writing the way they want
 bahut badi sankhya main logon ko soshal media par lagaaya gaya he, taaki ve bahason or muddon ko niyantrit kar saken
 Due to their ruckus, there is a bit of panic in the news rooms of the news channels
 ankar inhen janata samajhakar inaki bhashaa bolne lagate hai, or jab ye chup ho jate hai, to vah mudda channelon se gaayab ho jaataa he
 For example, the officer released on bail in Gujarat was made the Chief of Police
 ise lekar in samarthakon ne media ko gaali nahin di ki aap chup kyon hai, jabaki jis vyakti ko hataaya gaya he, vah khuleam kah rahaa he ki unhone pad se hataane kii guzarish nahin kii thi
 He should not be removed from the post of Chief of Police
 diji vanjaaraa jail se chhootakar aate hai, or saarvajanik rup se talwaar lekar dance karte hai
 He calls himself a patriot and thanks other patriots
 yahi ghatana agar kisi duusare rajya main hui hoti, to ye log galigalouj kaa ambara laga dete ki media bik gaya he
 The journalist is a thief, a broker
 sattadhari dal ke saathi sanghathanon or samarthakon ko afvaah failaane or galigalouj karne kii chhot he
 His words also caused tension among the people, but now they also started to understand what to trust and not
 log jaanane lage hai ki soshal media kaa kis tarah se rajnatik istemaal ho rahaa he
 If people do not warn, then this medium will be snatched from their hands
 abhi haal hi main amrapali houseing sosayadi ko lekar chand logon ne andolan kiya
 He made good use of social media and created a lot of pressure from Mahendra Singh Dhoni to the Amrapali group, due to which the news also came in the media, but the crowd of supporters who abused the journalists about the particular ideology of these citizens stood by
 aap pathakon ko inaki timeline par jaakar check karnaa chahie
 People usually ignore or block rumors of rumors, but when the administration starts doing this, it should be debated in public
 kya aarakshan ko lekar hinsak pradarshan internet se pehle ke daur main nahin hue
 
 
 The Violence is caused by the Internet, does it happen in every case
 police kaa kaam pradarshan sunishchit karana bhi he, taaki loktantr main awaz uthati rahe
 It is also a fact that violence is taking place during the Patel agitation
 andolan karne waalon ko bhi sochna hoga ki jab tak ve ahimsak andolan sunishchit nahin karenge, police ko aisa karne kaa mauka aasaani se miltaa rahegaa
 Patel leaders are also no less responsible for this
 kashmir main afvaah hi udi ki ek ladki ko kathith rup se sena ke logon ne chhedaa he
 The girl is repeatedly saying that the army men have not done so
 agar use patrakaron se milaayaa jaataa, uske video ko internet ke jariye failaayaa jaataa to kya sahi soochna ke aadhaar par prashasan bheed se behatar muqabla nahin kar paati
 There the press conference of the girl's mother was stopped, internet service was stopped
 prashasan ko sochna chahie ki internet band karne se pehle uskaa sahi istemaal kaise kiya ja saktaa he
 There is a way that information can be sent collectively to all internet users
 is tarah kii afvaahen to kai baar mukhyadhara kii media se bhi fail jaati hai
 The administration has also closed channels in many places
 tippaniyan This game has to be understood by ordinary citizens and to be alert
 raajnneetik samarthakon kii bhashaa bolne waalon kii nishtha sirf apane dal ke prati hoti he
 Had he been towards the country, he would have been making a ruckus about the drought
 lekin ye log yah afvaah failaane main lage hai ki bharat main pehali baar pani kii rail chali he
 Union Minister Uma Bharti is also saying this in the interview of our colleague Srinivas Jain
 un tak yah baat sarkaar se pahunchi yaa soshal media ke jariye
 
 
 The The Indian Express has published on Sunday that for the first time in India, a water train ran in Rajkot, Gujarat on May 2, 1986
 mujhe kisi ne soochna di thi ki '50 ke dashak main elahabaad se bundelkhand ke manikpur ke bich pani kii rail chalati thi
 i have not been able to confirm this information, but how are the people of the government speaking so easily that for the first time the water train has run
 kya ve apane tathyon kii sahi se jaanch karte hai
 It is better that we talk to the society
 prashasan sahi tathyon ko us tak pahunchaae or iske liye zaruri he ki internet seva band na ho
 Riots erupted in London a few years ago
 police ne paaya ki soshal media ke jariye kuch baaten failaai gai hai
 Instead of shutting down internet service, the police started spreading its message to the people
 nateeja yah hua ki hinsa tham gai
 a report was made about whether the Internet sparked riots
 zarurat he ki ham is afvaah samskruti ke raajnneetik paksh ko ujagar karen or sahi tathyon se muqabla karen
 Turning off the Internet should be the last resort, not the first step
 The Wire naam kii news site ne likhaa he ki kashmir main pichley chaar saal main 18 se 25 dinon ke liye internet seva band kii gai
 Last year, according to a Huffington Post report, Internet services were shut down nine times in four states in India between 2013 and 2015
 gujarat, kashmir ke alaava nagaland or manipur main internet band hua he
 In 2011, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) made an estimate that Egypt had lost $ 900 million by shutting down the Internet for five days
 varsh 2015 main germany kii ek sanstha ne pakistan main internet band kiye jane ko lekar ek adhyayan kar bataaya tha ki kaise isse na sirf abhivyakti kii swatantraaa par hamalaa hota he, balki rashtriya yaa vyaktigat suraksha yaa bijness ko bhi nuksaan pahunch saktaa he
 In India too, from the Times of India to the Indian Express wrote that during the first phase of the Patel agitation in Gujarat, there was a loss of between 30 crores to 7,000 crores
 ham sabakaa jivan ab internet se judaa hua he
 The government also does many of its work through the app
 i-commers, hotel, paryaton se lekar tamaam tarah ke bijness internet ke jariye hi hote hai
 Common people also now live through the net available on smartphones
 media main report kam hi hota he ki internet band hone se logon ko kis tarah se pareshaani hui
 The Internet is now like air and water
 kya prashasan hinsak sthiti main pani kii supplai band kar detaa he
 
 
 The If this is the case then the government should tell that when the internet will be closed for some reason, then you can go to the app and take its facilities
 prashasan ko dar rahata he ki soshal media ke jariye afvaahen failane se sthiti niyantran se baahar ho sakati he
 At times, she will also close her stories to prevent the spread of her failure
 soshal media par rose afvaahen failati rahati hai, to kya rose hi fasebuk or whotsap band kar diya jaae
 Social media emerged as a space where people were
 jo media or raajnneetik dalon se alag ek nae spes kii rachana kar rahe the or apni baaten likh rahe the
 Now there is no need to tell how the parties used this space to politicize and how the process of spreading rumors continues even today
 is khel main sattadhari dal se jude samarthakon or sanghathanon kaa hi palada baari rahata he
 There is rarely action against them
 sangathit rup se gaali di ja rahi he, dhamkee di ja rahi he or manamafik na likhane par raajnneetik samarthak whotsap se lekar fasebuk or twitor par badnaam karne kaa khel khilne lagate hai
 a large number of people have been put on social media to control debates and issues
 inke hangaamaa karne se news channelon ke news room main bhuuchaal-sa aa jaataa he
 Anchors consider them as the public and start speaking their language, and when they become silent, the issue disappears from the channels
 jaise gujarat main zamaanat par reeha hue adhikari ko police pramukh bana diya
 These supporters have not abused the media as to why you are silent, while the person who has been removed is openly saying that he did not ask for his removal from office
 unhen police pramukh ke pad se nahin hataaya jaae
 DG Vanzara comes out of jail, and publicly dances with a sword
 vah khud ko deshbhakt bataate hue duusare deshbhakton kaa shukriya adaa karte hai
 If the same incident had happened in another state, these people would have abused the media that the media has been sold
 falaanaa patrkaar chor he, dalal he
 Fellow organizations and supporters of the ruling party are allowed to spread rumors and abuses
 logon main inaki baton se tanaav bhi failaa, magar ab ve bhi samajhane lage ki kis baat par bharosa karnaa he kis par nahin
 People are beginning to know how political media is being used
 agar log nahin chete to unke haath se yah madhyam chhin jayega
 Recently, few people agitated about Amrapali Housing Society
 unhone soshal media kaa acha istemaal kar mahendra singh dhoni se lekar amrapali group tak par thik-thaak dabaav paidaa kar diya, jisaki vajah se media main bhi khabaren chalin, lekin khaas vichaardhaara ko lekar patrakaron ko gaali dene vaale samarthakon ke jansamooh ne in nagarikon kaa saath diya
 You readers should check on their timeline
 aamtaur par log afvahabaazon kii baton ko nazarandaaz kar dete hai yaa block kar dete hai, lekin jab prashasan aisa karne lage to is par saarvajanik bahes honi chahie
 Did not violent protests on reservation take place in the pre-internet era
 
 
 ? hinsa internet ke kaaran hi bhadakti he, kya yah har maamle main hota he
 Police work is also to ensure performance, so that the voices in democracy continue to be raised
 yah bhi ek tathy he ki patel andolan ke dauraan hinsa ho rahi he
 The agitators will also have to think that unless they ensure a non-violent movement, the police will get a chance to do so easily
 iske liye patel netaa bhi kam zimmedaar nahin hai
 Rumors arose in Kashmir that a girl was allegedly teased by army men
 vah ladki baar-baar kah rahi he ki sena ke logon ne aisa nahin kiya he
 Had he been introduced to journalists, his videos would have been spread through the internet, would the administration not have been able to compete better with the crowd on the basis of correct information
 vahaan ladki kii maa kaa press conference roak diya gaya, internet seva band kar di gai
 The administration should think how to use it properly before shutting down the Internet
 koi tarika nikaalnaa chahie ki sabhi internet upabhoktaaon ko samuhik rup se soochna bheji ja sake
 Such rumors are spread many times even by mainstream media
 prashasan ne kai jagahon par channelon ko bhi band kiya he
 The comments isi khel ko aam nagarikon ko samajhnaa he or satark rahanaa he
 Those who speak the language of political supporters only have loyalty to their party
 desh ke prati hoti to ve sookhe ko lekar hangaamaa kar rahe hote
 But these people are starting to spread the rumor that for the first time in India, there is a water rail
 kendriya mantri uma bharti bhi yah baat hamaare sahyogi shrinivas jain ke intervyuu main kah rahi hai
 The matter reached them either from the government or through social media
 
 
 ? indian express ne ravivaar ko chapa he ki 2 may, 1986 ko bharat main pehali baar gujarat ke rajkot main pani kii rail chali thi
 i was informed by someone that in the '50s there used to be a water rail between Allahabad to Manikpur in Bundelkhand
 main is soochna kii pushti nahin kar sakaa hum, lekin sarkaar ke log itani aasaani se kaise bol de rahe hai ki pehali baar pani kii rail chali he
 Do they check their facts properly
 behatar he ki ham samaaj se hi baat karen
 The administration should convey the correct facts and it is necessary that the internet service is not stopped
 kuch saal pehle landan main dange bhadak uthe
 Police found that some things have been spread through social media
 internet seva band karne kii jagah police ne apni baat logon tak pahunchaani shuru kar di
 The result was that the violence stopped
 ise lekar baqayada report banaai gai thi ki kya internet ke kaaran dange bhadakte hai
 What is needed is to highlight the political side of this rumor culture and compete with the right facts
 internet band karnaa antim upaay hona chahie, pehla kadam nahin
 All of our lives are now connected to the Internet
 sarkaar bhi apane kai kaam ap ke jariye karti he
 From e-commerce, hotels, tourism, all types of businesses are done through the Internet
 aam log bhi ab smartphone par uplabdh net ke jariye jite hai
 There are few reports in the media about how people were troubled by the shutdown of the Internet
 internet ab hawa-pani kii tarah he
 Does the administration stop water supply in a violent situation
 
 
 ? agar aisa he to sarkaar ko bataanaa chahie ki jab kisi kaaran se internet band hoga, tab aap ap ke alaava kahaan jaakar uski suvidhaayen le sakate hai
 The administration fears that the rumors may spread out of control through social media
 kai baar vah apni naakaami ke kisse failane se rokane ke liye bhi band karti hogi
 If rumors continue to spread on social media daily, should Facebook and whatsapp be discontinued every day
 soshal media kaa ubhaar ek aise spes ke rup main hua tha, jahaan log the
 Who were creating a new space and writing their own talks apart from the media and political parties
 ab bataane ki zarurat nahin he ki kis tarah se dalon ne is spes kaa istemaal raajnneetikaran karne main kiya or kis tarah se afvaahen failaane kaa silsilaa aaj bhi jari he
 In this game, the backbone of the supporters and organizations associated with the ruling party is heavy
 inke khilaaf shaayad hi kabhi karrwai hoti he
 Organized abuses, threats are being made and political supporters start playing a game of defamation from whatsapp to Facebook and Twitter for not writing the way they want
 bahut badi sankhya main logon ko soshal media par lagaaya gaya he, taaki ve bahason or muddon ko niyantrit kar saken
 Due to their ruckus, there is a bit of panic in the news rooms of the news channels
 ankar inhen janata samajhakar inaki bhashaa bolne lagate hai, or jab ye chup ho jate hai, to vah mudda channelon se gaayab ho jaataa he
 For example, the officer released on bail in Gujarat was made the Chief of Police
 ise lekar in samarthakon ne media ko gaali nahin di ki aap chup kyon hai, jabaki jis vyakti ko hataaya gaya he, vah khuleam kah rahaa he ki unhone pad se hataane kii guzarish nahin kii thi
 He should not be removed from the post of Chief of Police
 diji vanjaaraa jail se chhootakar aate hai, or saarvajanik rup se talwaar lekar dance karte hai
 He calls himself a patriot and thanks other patriots
 yahi ghatana agar kisi duusare rajya main hui hoti, to ye log galigalouj kaa ambara laga dete ki media bik gaya he
 The journalist is a thief, a broker
 sattadhari dal ke saathi sanghathanon or samarthakon ko afvaah failaane or galigalouj karne kii chhot he
 His words also caused tension among the people, but now they also started to understand what to trust and not
 log jaanane lage hai ki soshal media kaa kis tarah se rajnatik istemaal ho rahaa he
 If people do not warn, then this medium will be snatched from their hands
 abhi haal hi main amrapali houseing sosayadi ko lekar chand logon ne andolan kiya
 He made good use of social media and created a lot of pressure from Mahendra Singh Dhoni to the Amrapali group, due to which the news also came in the media, but the crowd of supporters who abused the journalists about the particular ideology of these citizens stood by
 aap pathakon ko inaki timeline par jaakar check karnaa chahie
 People usually ignore or block rumors of rumors, but when the administration starts doing this, it should be debated in public
 kya aarakshan ko lekar hinsak pradarshan internet se pehle ke daur main nahin hue
 
 
 The Violence is caused by the Internet, does it happen in every case
 police kaa kaam pradarshan sunishchit karana bhi he, taaki loktantr main awaz uthati rahe
 It is also a fact that violence is taking place during the Patel agitation
 andolan karne waalon ko bhi sochna hoga ki jab tak ve ahimsak andolan sunishchit nahin karenge, police ko aisa karne kaa mauka aasaani se miltaa rahegaa
 Patel leaders are also no less responsible for this
 kashmir main afvaah hi udi ki ek ladki ko kathith rup se sena ke logon ne chhedaa he
 The girl is repeatedly saying that the army men have not done so
 agar use patrakaron se milaayaa jaataa, uske video ko internet ke jariye failaayaa jaataa to kya sahi soochna ke aadhaar par prashasan bheed se behatar muqabla nahin kar paati
 There the press conference of the girl's mother was stopped, internet service was stopped
 prashasan ko sochna chahie ki internet band karne se pehle uskaa sahi istemaal kaise kiya ja saktaa he
 There is a way that information can be sent collectively to all internet users
 is tarah kii afvaahen to kai baar mukhyadhara kii media se bhi fail jaati hai
 The administration has also closed channels in many places
 tippaniyan This game has to be understood by ordinary citizens and to be alert
 raajnneetik samarthakon kii bhashaa bolne waalon kii nishtha sirf apane dal ke prati hoti he
 Had he been towards the country, he would have been making a ruckus about the drought
 lekin ye log yah afvaah failaane main lage hai ki bharat main pehali baar pani kii rail chali he
 Union Minister Uma Bharti is also saying this in the interview of our colleague Srinivas Jain
 un tak yah baat sarkaar se pahunchi yaa soshal media ke jariye
 
 
 The The Indian Express has published on Sunday that for the first time in India, a water train ran in Rajkot, Gujarat on May 2, 1986
 mujhe kisi ne soochna di thi ki '50 ke dashak main elahabaad se bundelkhand ke manikpur ke bich pani kii rail chalati thi
 i have not been able to confirm this information, but how are the people of the government speaking so easily that for the first time the water train has run
 kya ve apane tathyon kii sahi se jaanch karte hai
 It is better that we talk to the society
 prashasan sahi tathyon ko us tak pahunchaae or iske liye zaruri he ki internet seva band na ho
 Riots erupted in London a few years ago
 police ne paaya ki soshal media ke jariye kuch baaten failaai gai hai
 Instead of shutting down internet service, the police started spreading its message to the people
 nateeja yah hua ki hinsa tham gai
 a report was made about whether the Internet sparked riots
 zarurat he ki ham is afvaah samskruti ke raajnneetik paksh ko ujagar karen or sahi tathyon se muqabla karen
 Turning off the Internet should be the last resort, not the first step
 prashasan ko dar rahata he ki soshal media ke jariye afvaahen failane se sthiti niyantran se baahar ho sakati he
 At times, she will also close her stories to prevent the spread of her failure
 soshal media par rose afvaahen failati rahati hai, to kya rose hi fasebuk or whotsap band kar diya jaae
 Social media emerged as a space where people were
 jo media or raajnneetik dalon se alag ek nae spes kii rachana kar rahe the or apni baaten likh rahe the
 Now there is no need to tell how the parties used this space to politicize and how the process of spreading rumors continues even today
 is khel main sattadhari dal se jude samarthakon or sanghathanon kaa hi palada baari rahata he
 There is rarely action against them
 sangathit rup se gaali di ja rahi he, dhamkee di ja rahi he or manamafik na likhane par raajnneetik samarthak whotsap se lekar fasebuk or twitor par badnaam karne kaa khel khilne lagate hai
 a large number of people have been put on social media to control debates and issues
 inke hangaamaa karne se news channelon ke news room main bhuuchaal-sa aa jaataa he
 Anchors consider them as the public and start speaking their language, and when they become silent, the issue disappears from the channels
 jaise gujarat main zamaanat par reeha hue adhikari ko police pramukh bana diya
 These supporters have not abused the media as to why you are silent, while the person who has been removed is openly saying that he did not ask for his removal from office
 unhen police pramukh ke pad se nahin hataaya jaae
 DG Vanzara comes out of jail, and publicly dances with a sword

 Those who speak the language of political supporters only have loyalty to their party
 desh ke prati hoti to ve sookhe ko lekar hangaamaa kar rahe hote
 But these people are starting to spread the rumor that for the first time in India, there is a water rail
 kendriya mantri uma bharti bhi yah baat hamaare sahyogi shrinivas jain ke intervyuu main kah rahi hai
 The matter reached them either from the government or through social media
 
 
 ? indian express ne ravivaar ko chapa he ki 2 may, 1986 ko bharat main pehali baar gujarat ke rajkot main pani kii rail chali thi
 i was informed by someone that in the '50s there used to be a water rail between Allahabad to Manikpur in Bundelkhand
 main is soochna kii pushti nahin kar sakaa hum, lekin sarkaar ke log itani aasaani se kaise bol de rahe hai ki pehali baar pani kii rail chali he
 Do they check their facts properly
 behatar he ki ham samaaj se hi baat karen
 The administration should convey the correct facts and it is necessary that the internet service is not stopped
 kuch saal pehle landan main dange bhadak uthe
 Police found that some things have been spread through social media
 internet seva band karne kii jagah police ne apni baat logon tak pahunchaani shuru kar di
 The result was that the violence stopped
 ise lekar baqayada report banaai gai thi ki kya internet ke kaaran dange bhadakte hai
 What is needed is to highlight the political side of this rumor culture and compete with the right facts
 internet band karnaa antim upaay hona chahie, pehla kadam nahin
 It is better that we talk to the society
 prashasan sahi tathyon ko us tak pahunchaae or iske liye zaruri he ki internet seva band na ho
 Riots erupted in London a few years ago
 police ne paaya ki soshal media ke jariye kuch baaten failaai gai hai
 Instead of shutting down internet service, the police started spreading its message to the people
 nateeja yah hua ki hinsa tham gai

 The Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI) has demanded from GST Council and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley that the GST tax be amended in view of the damage caused by the floods in the mineral
 CTI kaa kahana he ki kerala main baadh ke chalate jaan maal kaa kaaphi nuksaan hua he, aise main kerala ke vyapaariyon ko tex kii maar se bachaaya jaae
 According to CTI convenor Brijesh Goyal, traders in Kerala will not only have to bear the loss of not only the stocked goods but also the input tax credit ie ITC received under GST because if any goods are purchased under the rule and if it is stolen Or if it gets bad then no ITC is found on that goods
 yani vyapaariyon ko maal ke nuksaan ke saath-saath tex kii maar bhi jhelni padegi
 CTI has also written a letter to the CM of Kerala including GST Council, Union Finance Minister
 patr main likhaa he ki kerala main prakritik aapadaa ke chalate vahaan ke vyapaariyon kaa bura haal he
 In such a situation, by amending the rules of GST, traders should be saved from tax at least
 chambar of trade and industry ke mutabik jiesti act ke section 17(5)(i) ke tahat agar kharida hua maal gum ho jaye, chori ho jaye, kharaab yaa khatm ho jaye to uski kharid main shaamil input tex credit kharidaar vyapaaree ko nahin milegaa
 Traders from the Chamber of Trade Industry, for example, told that a Kerala company bought goods from a Delhi company
 maal kii keemat thi 8 lakh rupee or us par jiesti laga 2 lakh rupee, to invais hui 10 lakh rupee kii
 The Delhi-based company took the entire Rs 10 lakh from the Kerala company and deposited a GST of two lakh out of that
 yani sarkaar ke paas 2 lakh rupee jiesti ke taur par pahunch gaye
 Now when the Kerala company sells the goods, it will get 2 lakh rupees back from the government as input tax credit
 lekin baadh main maal bah jane se kerala company ke paas bill to he par maal nahin he
 Therefore, the Kerala company will not get ITC 2 lakh rupees for this bill
 yani kerala company ko nuksaan puure das lakh kaa hua
 Now if the government exempts from 17 (5) (i) then the loss will be reduced to only eight lakhs, which was the price of the goods
 vyapaariyon kaa maananaa he ki section 17(5)(i) ke tahat yah saaf he ki jo saamaan nasht ho jaae us par itisi nahin milegaa
 But here is the case of natural disaster
 aise main sarkaar chaahe to niyam ke tahat hi sanshodhan kar sakati he
 For this, the government has the right in section 11 of GST that it can amend any rule if it wants
 aalha-oodal kii virgatha main kaha gaya he 'bade ladaiya mahube vaale, inaki maar sahi na jaae
 
 !' aaj se 831 saal pehle dilli naresh prithviraj chouhan ne rajkumaari chandraval ko paane or paras pathari va naulakha haar luutane ke iraade se chandel shaasha raja parmaal dev ke rajya mahoba par chadhaai kii thi

 yuddh ke kaaran bundelkhand kii betiyaan rakshabandhan ke duusare din 'kajli' dafan kar saki thim
 The tradition of celebrating the historic Kajali Mela as 'vijay Utsav', symbol of the heroic story of alha-udal, is still alive today
 mahoba riyasat ke chandel shaskaon ke senapati rahe aalha or oodal ko desh main koun nahin jaanata
 At the behest of King Mama Mahil of Orai in 1181, King Paramal Dev expelled both of his generals (alha-udal) from the kingdom, after which both took refuge with King Lakhan Rana of Kannauj
 isaki bhanak lagate hi dilli naresh prithviraj ne us samay mahoba par chadhaai kii, jab rakshabandhan ke din dola main savaar hokar rajkumaari chandraval (raja parmaal kii beti) apni sakhiyon ke saath kirat sagar main kajli dafan karne pahunchin
 In order to stop the war, Prithviraj conditioned to hand over the defeat of daughter Chandraval, Paras Pathri and Naulakha to King Paramal
 yah shart daastaa sweekaar karne jaisi thi, isliye yuddh ke sivaa koi chaara nahin tha or kirat sagar ke isi maidan main donon senaaon ke bich jabardast yuddh chhid jane par bundelkhand kii betiyaan us din kajli nahin dafan kar sakin
 Princess Chandraval also fought the opposing army with her friends
 is yuddh main parmaal kaa betaa rajkumaar abhai shahid ho gaya
 When this news reached Kannauj, Alha, Udal and Kannauj Naresh Lakhan reached the ground of Kirat Sagar in Sadhuvesh and defeated Prithviraj's army
 is yuddh main bundeli raja parmaal kii jeet or aalha va unke chote bhai oodal kii virgatha ke pratik swaroop har saal kirat sagar maidan main sarkari kharch par aitihaasik kajli mela 'vijay utsav' ke rup main manaane kii parampara ban gai he
 The special thing is that due to that war, Rakshabandhan is celebrated on the second day in the entire area
 itihaaskaar radhakrishna bundeli bataate hai, 'aalha or oodal kii virgatha se judaa yah mahoba kaa kajli mela har saal 'vijay utsav' ke rup main manaane kii parampara he
 He explains that it is customary to celebrate Rakshabandhan by buried Kajali on the second day due to the Mahoba War in Bundelkhand
 mahoba kii jiladhikari dow kaajal bataati hai, 'yah mahoba kaa aitihaasik mela he, jo har saal nagar palika parishad ke bajet par yojit kiya jaataa he
 The Kajali Mela, which starts on August 3, will last for a week
 'jiladhikari ne bataaya ki is meley main dur-daraaj se lagbhag dedh lakh logon ke pahunchane kaa anumaan he
 Tight security arrangements will be made for the people and teams of top officials of various departments have been formed to ensure that people do not face any kind of problem
 nagar palika parishad kii adhyaksh puspa anuraagi bataati hai ki is meley main ghazal gayak anup jalota or bundeli lokgeeton ke samraat deshraj pateria ke kaarykram ke alaava rashtriya kavi sammelan va mushaayare kaa aayojan bhi kiya jayega
 She says that it is not only Mahoba but the biggest and important celebration of the entire glorious history of Bundelkhand
