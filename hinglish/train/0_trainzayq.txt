 Pregnant women are advised to eat more nutritious and healthy food
 aisa isliye bhi kaha jaataa he kyonki maa kaa khanpan uske garbh main pal rahe bachche ko poshan detaa he
 For better health, mother and child, it is very important that mother take care of every little thing in her routine
 yahaan tak ki aap kis tarah ke bartan main khaanaa khaaen, yah jaan lenaa bhi bahut jaruri he
 Although the doctor forbids everyone to eat in plastic utensils but this becomes even more important in the case of pregnant women
 plastic kii bottle yaa phir anya bartanon main maujuud rasaynic tatv sharir ke liye bahut hi hanikaarak hote hai
 This is why it is advisable not to heat food in plastic utensils in microwave ovens
 agar pani pine ke liye plastic kii bottle kaa istemaal karte hai to saavdhaan ho jaaie
 Due to heat, plastic utensils emit cancer causing chemicals which are found in food items
 aaie jaanate hai kigarbhavatee mahilaon ko dibbaband khaane kii chizoor plastic ke bartanon main khaanaa kyon nahin khaanaa chahie
 
 
 - Very dangerous chemical is found in plastic utensils
 agar aap plastic kii bottle main pani pite he yaa bartanon main khaanaa khate he to aapako cancer ho saktaa he
 Among these, pregnant women may be the biggest risk from eating food
 - agar koi garbhvatee mahila plastic kii bottle main pani pie yaa khaanaa khaae to isse maujuud rasinic tatv maa ke jariye bacch tak pahunchakar use nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 - Using plastic utensils can cause mental, physical and brain-related diseases to the child of a pregnant woman
 plastic ke bartanon main bisphenol e chemical hota he jo garbhvatee mahilaon ke hormones main gadabadi paidaa kar saktaa he
 - Doctors also prohibit pregnant women from eating food in plastic utensils by heating them
 bazaar main milane vaale dibbaband khaane ke se bhi is dauraan parhez karen
 Due to this chemical found in plastic utensils, estrogen becomes very active in mothers
 yah bachche ke vikaas par prabhaav daalata he or mahilaon ko prajnan sambandhi samasyaayein utpann karata he
 - Feeding the baby with a plastic bottle is also very harmful because it has the worst effect on the child's immunity
 iske alaava yah bachche ke mastishk par bhi nakaaratmak asar karata he
 - Bisphenol a (BPA) chemical products found in plastic utensils are banned in China, France and Canada
 aise main sirf vahi plastic ke bartanon kaa prayog karen jis par 'bisphenol e (BPA) free' likhaa hota he
 According to the Health Minister, the decision of the Supreme Court is being implemented and the behavioral issues related to it are being removed

 ) The Commissioner of Delhi Police, Bhimsen Bassi, was busy cleaning the Tilak Marg police station with full disguise
 isse pehle police ke kai bade adhikari jhaadu chalaakar is muhim ko lagaataar hawa de rahe hai
 Prior to the beginning of the cleanliness drive, the Prime Minister suddenly went to the Mandir Marg police station and started cleaning after seeing the dirt
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki grih mantralay ne aadesh de diya ki ek hafte ke andar dilli ke sabhi thanon ko saaf−suthra kar diya jaae
 In the same police station in which Tilak Marg police station was engaged in cleaning, the seized vehicles and the 'case property' stored in the consignment were turned into junk by turning water into this campaign
 chaahe dughartna ke maamalon main jabt hui gaadiyaan hon yaa duusare gambhir aparaadhon main yaa phir laavarish yaa chori se baraamad hue vaahan, kanoonee pechidagiyon ke chalate inke nibataan main lanbaa samay lag jaataa he
 In such a situation, nothing is left in these vehicles except the structure
 aise hi thane main jabt duusare saamaanon jaise drugs, hathiyaar, nakli karency, sharaab yaa duusare saamaan bhi baari maatra main thanon main bhare pade hai
 Cases last 20–20 years and till then it is the responsibility of the police to preserve them
 thanon main jagah kam hoti he to adhiktar jabt hue vaahan thanon ke baahar hi dikhte hai, ek kabad ke rup main
 Although there is also a dumpyard to keep such vehicles in every district, but according to the vehicles they are also less
 halaat ye hai ki dilli main kai thane hai jo danpyard main tabdeel ho chuke hai
 Seized vehicles surround the Greater Kailash police station
 ye wo vaahan hai jinke cese yaa to court main lambit hai yaa inpar daawa karne vaala koi nahin he
 If we look at the statistics of Delhi Police itself, the number of vehicles seized in Delhi is around 26 thousand
 inamen se kareeb 20 hajaar vaahan ek saal se zyada samay se jabt hai
 The number of other seized goods is close to two lakh 80 thousand
 inamen kareeb do lakh 40 hajaar saamaan ek saal se zyada samay se jabt hai
 The security of such a case property, the waste of the junk, the lack of space in the police stations and the convenience of the people is a big challenge for the police
 isi saal sitambar ke maheene main ek yachika par sunwaayee ke baad dilli hycourt ne cese praparty ke maamle nibatane kii samay seemaa ek maheene tay kar di thi
 Also, the court also said that every three months, the police will have to submit a report about the case property to the court
 janemaane vakil pike sharma kaa kahana he police cese praparty kii tasviren court main dikhaakar cese praparty kaa niptaan kar sakati he, halaki alag-alag cese praparty ke niptaan ke liye kanoon ke alag-alag maanak or adchane hai
 It remains to be seen how the Delhi Police deal with the junk stuck in the legal process and how to make the police stations of Delhi clean and beautiful

 More than a week has passed since the election results in Maharashtra, but the deadlock over government formation still remains
 shivasena kii dhai saal ke mukhyamantri kii maang par bijepi chuppi saadhe hue he
 As a result, Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut has threatened to form the government without the BJP
 vahiin duusari taraf kahani main ek twist ye bhi he pehle vipaksh main baithne kaa daawa kar rahi ensipi bhi halaat par nazar banaae hue he
 Meanwhile, there is news that Sharad Pawar is going to meet Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Monday
 duusari taraf is baat par bhi kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai kiuddhav thakare kii sharad pavaar se kya phone par koi baatcheet hui he
 Meanwhile, a question also arises whether Sharad Pawar can become a kingmaker
 enditivi se baat karte hue NCP netaa supriya sule ne kaha ki agar bijepi shivasena sarkaar nahin bani to unki party apana kartavya nibhaayegi
 Significantly, many days have passed since the election results, but still the government does not seem to be formed in Maharashtra
 uski vajah he ki shivasena or BJP jinhone milakar chunaav ladaa or ab aapas main hi ulajh gaye hai
 The point is that the Shiv Sena is adamant that a formula was decided between Amit Shah and Uddhav Thackeray that if the Shiv Sena and the BJP form a government, then the Shiv Sena and the BJP for two and a half years should rule
 darasal shivasena aditya thakare ko jo ki uddhav thakare ke bete hai or thakare parivaar ke pehle aise vyakti hai jinhone chunaav ladaa he, unako mukhyamantri bananaa chaahati he lekin abhi tak is par baat ban nahin pai he
 The Ravichandran Ashwin-led spin attack devastated New Zealand's batting and set a resounding foundation here to achieve a 5-0 clean sweep in the series by Parthiv Patel and Yuvraj Singh, who led India to eight wickets
 Steamed win
 yah pehla avasar he ki jabaki bharat ne paanch maichon kii shrinkhalaa ke sabhi match jitkar clin sweep kiya ho
 Earlier, India won the first five matches of the seven-match series against England in 2008 but canceled the last two matches due to the terrorist attack in Mumbai

 India did not have a good start and lost the runs of Gautam Gambhir (0) and Virat Kohli (2) in fine form for ten runs but Parthiv Patel (56 not out) and Yuvraj Singh (42 not out) lost some unexpected Kiwis
 The desire to achieve was not fulfilled and the unbroken partnership of 97 runs for the third wicket brought the team score to 107 for two
 is jeet ke saath hi mahendra singh dhoni ko vishram diye jane ke kaaran captaini kaa jimmaa sanbhaalane vaale gambhir ke naam par anokhaa ricard jud gaya

 Ali tries pushups but by the end his pushups are not so clean

 Praneeth is in another team and gets angry, on which he shouts at Karishma

 Ali arrives screaming from the washroom and gets entangled with Praneeth
 thodi hi der main yah masti bhari tu-tu main-main ladaai main tabdeel ho jaati he or donon hi abhadra bhashaa par utar jate hai
 Praneeth calls Ali a very 'rubbish man', on which Ali calls Praneeth a 'dog'

 Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar says the Indian attack lacks the kind of quickness that England need to go all out twice in Tests
 agle maheene shuru hone vaali chunauteepurn paanch test maichon kii shrunkhlaa main yuva bhartiya akraman kii aguwai ishanth sharma or bhubaneshwar kumaar karenge
 Mohammed Shami, Varun Aaron and r Ashwin are the other bowlers in the Indian attack but Vengsarkar is a little skeptical in his effectiveness
 unhone kaha, 'bharat ke liye yah kathin hoga
 We need bowlers who can bowl them twice, but unfortunately i do not see any bowler as we will play with four bowlers
 chaar gendbaajon main se aapke paas do gendbaaj aise hone chahie jo match main aapako 10 wicket dilaa saken
 i don't think anyone would do that
 ' After launching his academy website, Vengsarkar said, "but you don't know in cricket, anything can happen in it
" main ummid kar rahaa hum ki bharat acha kare
 But England's team is very good at its own ground
 lambey samay baad ham paanch maichon kii shrunkhlaa khel rahe hai, mujhe ummid he ki ham acha karenge, hamaare liye yahi mahatvapurn he
 ' england daura 26 june se licester main teen divasiy match se shuru hoga
 The visiting team will play another three-day warm-up match against Derbyshire from 1 to 3 July

 Other Test matches will be played at Lord's from 17 to 21 July, Southampton's Aegis Bowl from 27 to 31 July, 7 to 11 August at Olt Trafford and Oval from 15 to 19 August
 vengsarakar kaa maananaa he ki test shrunkhlaa se pehle mahaj do abhyaas match khelnaa hi halaat ke anukulit hone ke liye kaaphi nahin he
 He said, 'the first two Test matches will be very tough because the players will know what the conditions are there and they should prepare well
 do a5yaas match kaaphi kam hai, unhen pehla test shuru hone se pehle kam se chaar se paanch a5yaas match khilne chahie the
 ' purv bhartiya khilaadi ajit agarkar bhi is maukey par maujuud the
 He said, 'five tests will not be easy
 lekin england kii team punarnirmaan bhi kar rahi he, jo bharat ke liye acchhee cheez honi chahie
 His bowling attack is also balanced by the presence of James Anderson

 ' dilli sarkaar banaam up rajyapal vivaad par supreme court ke faisle ko arvind kejariwal ne samvidhan ke khilaaf bataaya he
 After the Supreme Court's decision, the Bharatiya Janata Party also attacked Arvind Kejriwal and said that the Chief Minister of Delhi has disobeyed the Supreme Court
 bijepi pravaktaa sambit paatra ne guuruuvaar ko press conference main kaha ki supreme court ke faisle se arvind kejariwal kii karaari haar hui he
 BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that Arvind Kejriwal has done contempt of court by doing the press conference
 ham is masale par kejariwal ke khilaaf avmaananaa kaa cese daayar karne par vichaar kar rahe hai
 Arvind Kejriwal had earlier raised slogans against Sharad Pawar, Rahul Gandhi and said that democracy is to be saved, but will democracy be saved in this way
 unhone kaha ki arvind kejariwal dilli kii janata ko supreme court par hamalaa karne ke liye uksaa rahe hai
 Sambit Patra alleged that on one hand Kejriwal is saying that he ran a brilliant government for 4 years, but on the other side says that the center-court is not allowing him to work
 bijepi pravaktaa ne kaha ki arvind kejariwal ko dobaaraa press conference kar supreme court se maafee maangani chahie
 He has made a declaration against the Supreme Court
 sambit paatra ne kaha ki aaj mamata banerjee, sharad pavaar or rahul gandhi jaise netaa kyon chup hai
 He also questioned the tweet made by Sanjay Singh
 gauratlab he ki supreme court ne 6 muddon par guuruuvaar ko faisla sunaaya, jisamen se adhikariyon ke transfar-posting ke maamle ko badi bench ke paas bhej diya he

 After a long time Sonia Gandhi, the chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) and former head of the All India Congress Committee (AICC), is going to campaign
 sonia gandhi or congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi 23 november ko telugana ke medchal main chunavi sabha ko sambodhit karenge
 The public has to tell who created the state, the political rhetoric in the Congress and the ruling TRS has intensified since this rally in Telangana
 ek taraf telugana congress ke netaa sonia gandhi ko 'madar of telugana' bataa rahe hai, to vahiin tiares ke netaa ke chandrashekhar raav ko 'fadar of telugana' bataa rahe hai
 In fact, the 'prajakutami' or 'people's alliance' formed in the state between the TDP, Telangana Jan Samithi and CPI under the leadership of Congress, wants to challenge KCR on the strength of UPA chief Sonia, who describes herself as the creator of Telangana
 prajakutami ke paas telugana ke gathan kaa shrey lene kii vajah bhi hai, kyonki rajya nirmaan ke baad june 2014 main pehali baar vidhansabha ko sambodhit karte hue mukhyamantri kesiar ne vidhansabha ke floor se kaha tha ki sabhi ko yah baat yaad rakhni chahie ki yadi aaj telugana astitv main he to isaki vajah sonia gandhi hai
 Who fully supported this demand and turned it into reality
 ab upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi telugana ke gathan ke baad pehali baar rajya main aa rahi hai
 Therefore, extensive preparations are being made for this rally to be held in Medchal on 23 November
 jisamen 70 vidhansabha kshetron main elidi screen lagaai ja rahi hai taaki rajya kii zyada se zyada janata sonia gandhi ko sun sake
 In this public meeting, many social organizations will also honor Sonia Gandhi for playing a major role in the formation of Telangana

 It was then said on behalf of the Telangana Congress that it was merely a demand and not part of the manifesto
 mana ja rahaa he ki is vishaal jansabha main upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi 'janata kaa ghoshnaptr' bhi jari karengi
 According to sources, this manifesto may include promises such as free treatment of all diseases, loan of 5 lakh to build landholding houses, unemployment allowance of Rs 3000, pension to those who took part in Telangana construction movement and loan waiver of farmers
 
 karnataka ke baad telugana ko chunaahal main sampann karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne 21 maheene ke brake ke baad do reliyaan kii thim
 Earlier, he had a road show on 2 August 2016 in Varanasi, the Lok Sabha constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Uttar Pradesh
 lekin road sho ke samaapan sthal se chand kilometre dur unki tabiyat kharaab ho jane kii vajah se bich main hi chhodkar unhen dilli aana padaa
 After this, Sonia was also away from the assembly elections in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura
 yah bhi padhein: sonia kaa PM modi par palatwaar, kuch log kaam karte hai or kuch shrey lete hemhaalanki sonia gandhi himanchal pradesh main chunaav se thik pehle ve oktober 2017 main shimla gayi thim

 iske baad unhen disambar 2017 main goa main ek resort main chuttee ke dauraan cycling karte dekha gaya
 It was also not an election tour
 ab may 2018 ke baad sonia gandhi ek baar phir chunavi samar main congress ke liye prachaar karne ja rahi hai
 The impact of this rally on Telangana assembly elections will be known only on December 11

 5 starbharat main saamaajik muddon par kai filmein bani hai, or is baar unheen main se ek ahm mudda 'kanya hatya' par yah film banaai gai he, aaie film kii samiksha karte hai-kahani-yah kahani domahilaonki he, ek kajraya (minu huda) jo haryana ke ek gaanv main rahati he, jise gaanv vaale 'mata' ke rup main apane ghar kii navjaat ladakiyon ko saunp dete hai or wo unka katl kar diya karti he or badale main gharavaalon ko ladkaa hone kaa aashirwad diya karti he or vahiin duusari taraf dilli ke ek media agency main kaam karne vaali mira sharma (riddhimaa sood) hai jo us gaanv main jaakar poornamasi ke din hui ghatana kii tafteesh kar rahi hoti he, or is dauraan banavaari (kuldeep ruhil) or kajraya se bhi mulaakaat karti he
 Now will Meera be able to expose this entire incident? For this, you will have to watch the film
 script-film kii kahani bharat ke gaanvon kijamini hakikatore khaas taur se navjaat bacchiyon kii hatya par focus karti he
 The film also points towards the silence of the village people, and a domineering group that is able to force anyone to do anything
 script main gaanv ke logon or police ke bich saath ganth ko bhi darshaya gaya he
 The story is good but the filming could have been even better
 imotional maahaul main jis tarah se is film kii shuruyaat hoti he, kahani kaa ant or bhi behatar dikhaaya ja saktaa tha
 The figures shown at the end of the film also do the work of 'opening the eyes' and show that a lot of research has been done behind the film
 film kii shooting tipical documentry style main kii gayi he jo shaayad zyada darshakon ko aakarshith kar paane main kaamyaab nahin ho paaegi
 Meenu Hooda, who is playing the title role of the acting-film, is a great authority

 Weak link - The film's weak link is its filming, the issue is important but it is filmed at a very slow pace, the makers should have given the film a different look to reach the maximum audience, especially its conclusion better
 could have been done

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi started to increase his mass base by using social media as part of his electoral strategy with the 2012 Gujarat assembly elections
 2014 ke chunavi mahayuddh main piem modi kii jeet main bhi soshal media ne bada role adaa kiya tha
 After the 2014 elections, the BJP became the most active political party on social media
 haalanki pichley dinon main jis tarah se centre sarkaar ne GST, petrol yaa deazal kii keemton main badhotaree sahit kuch faisle liye jo janata kii bhaawanaaon ke vipareet the
 After that, questions began to be raised on the social media about these decisions of the government
 abhi gujarat or himachal ke chunaav sir par hai, aise main soshal media par jaahir hoti logon kii naaraazgi bijepi ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban gaye
 Especially on the social media in Gujarat, as soon as the verbal war on the government and the party started, there was a panic in the BJP leadership
 usee vaqt idhar congress ne soshal media ke zariye bijepi ko gujarat main gherne kii ranneeti par kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 After that, on social media, seeing the atmosphere against the party, the central government and the Gujarat government would get more strength, the BJP had to get into a defensive mood
 shaayad yahi vajah thi ki amit shah ko bijepi kaaryakartaaon kii ek baithak main yah tak kahana padaa ki unhen soshal media par chal rahi chizon par dhyaan dene kii jarurat nahin
 At the same time, BJP has also started changing its strategy on social media and responding to the Congress in its language
 yahaan party ne jumalon kaa jawaab jumalon se, video kaa jawaab video se, tathyon kaa jawaab tathyon se, puraane itihaas kaa jawaab puraane itihaas se dena shuru kiya
 The Congress also started making some videos viral on social media
 bijepi ne bhi gujarat or himachal ke vidhansabha chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhkar ek baar puri taaqat ke saath soshal media par apni sakriyata ko badhanaa shuru kar diya
 Therefore, in 2014, the pm's social media incharge and currently Overseas Friend of BJP convenor Vijay Chaturwala has once again been tasked to create an atmosphere in favor of the party on social media, especially in Gujarati language, in the Gujarat elections
 vahiin himachal chunaav kii jimmedaari kendriya iti cell ke sanyojak amit malviya kii team ke paas he
 BJP does its publicity on social media through Twitter, whatsapp's, Facebook, Instagram
 desh bhar main bijepi kii koi bhi activity ko live dikhaane ke liye 'BJP Live' naam se internet channel hai, jisko har rose das lakh se zyaada log dekhte hai
 Along with this, the party has its own youtube channel called 'BJP for India', which is watched by over fifty and a half million people every month
 vahiin email ke jariye piem modi or amit shah sahit duusare bade netaaon ke bhaashan or press conference lakhon karodon logon ko bheje jate hai
 Big BJP leaders also chat live on Facebook
 aaj bijepi ke aadhikarik twitor handle ke 70 lakh se zyaada foloar he, jabaki do saal pehle yah sankhya mahaj 17 lakh thi
 Talking about the Congress at the same time, it has 27 lakh followers on Twitter
 vahiin fesabook par bijepi ke lagbhag dedh karod foloar hai, jo do saal pehle 70 lakh ke qareeb the
 While the number of followers of Congress is close to 45 lakhs
 yahaan donon partiyon ke post ko ritvit or line kiye jane ke osat main bhi baari antar he
 If you look at the figures, BJP is far ahead of Congress on Twitter and Facebook
 abhi tak congress ne utyub channel, live internet TV or fasebuk chat or email ke jariye apane netao ke bhaashan logon ko bhejnaa bhi shuru bhi nahin kiya he
 One thing and Congress should not only fight this battle on social media with BJP, but also the social media team 'mygov', the Narendra Modi app and the social media team of all ministers of central government, to make the achievements of the Modi government accessible to the public
 The social media team of the RSS is also from the ranks, which are nowhere less than the social media professionals
 filhal soshal media par shuruaati rispons se gadgad congress ko bhale lagata ho ki vah is ladaai main bijepi ko pachhad sakati hai, lekin uski philhal kii taiyaariyon ko dekhte hue lagata he ki usne abhi sirf ladaai ladane kii taiyaari kii he, jeetne kii nahin
 Therefore, the Congress leadership should understand that fighting a battle is a different matter and winning is different

 Despite spending thousands of crores in Madhya Pradesh, malnutrition takes 47 children out of every 1000
 ye aankade hai sample registration system yani esares ke 2019 ke bulatin se
 Right now the death of children in Bihar is a brain fever but is there really only one reason, or is the entire system indifferent towards children
 poshan aahaar, ye skim-wo skim ke naam par karodon kharchane kaa daawa he phir bhi kyon bad rahe hai bal mrityu dar ke aankade? The SRS report is again stating that malnutrition in Madhya Pradesh has taken a form of age for children
 rajya navjaat bacchon kii kuposhan ke kaaran maut ke maamle main pehali paaydaan par he, wo bhi tab jab 2016 se 2018 tak kuposhan mitaane ke naam par kareeb 19 hajaar karod rupye kharch karne kaa daawa kiya gaya
 People of Sahariya tribe living in Karahal in Sheopur have become a photo feature for malnutrition
 jile main 1226 anganwari centre hai
 
 
 Some day care also, government says to give 40 lakh rupees every month to Anganwadi centers
 karaahal vijaipur main teen NRC centre bhi kuposhit bacchon ke liye chalaae jate hai
 
 
 But the situation is more or less the same from year to year
 shyopur main sahaaria, to shadol main baigaa adivasee bacchon kii haalat ek jaisi he
 In the entire division, 45,000 children are said to be malnourished
 do maheene pehle sajan baigaa ke sharir main maance nahin sirf haddiyaan thim, use bhopal ames bheja gaya lekin baccha bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 In Mandsaur, 1,22,259 children have been diagnosed with malnutrition
 zile ke poshan punarvaas centre main 20 bachche philhal admit hai jinamein se adhiktar ati kuposhit hai
 Most laborers or children of small farmers are becoming malnourished due to lack of nutritious food
 chhatarpur main gadhi malahara ke suraj anuraagi kii umr 3 saal, vazan ek kilo 800 gram
 The condition of the rest of the children is also not very good
 beete saal may 2019 tak 32 hajaar se adhik bachche kuposhit the
 These situations occur when there are about two lakh children in 2058 Anganwadi centers in the district
 kuposhan dur karne main centre sarkaar kii yojanaayen jameen par dam tod rahi hai, rajya main adivasee bahul dhar ke enarasi main sabase zyada 1300 kuposhit bachche bhartee hue the
 Sagar district is at number three in the case of malnourished children
 pichley saal april se simtabar maheene main jile ke 11 enarasi centaron par 1118 kuposhit bachche bhartee hue the
 Surprisingly, there is not a single NRC center in the state where 100% malnourished children are nurtured
 sagar main shishu rog visheshgy dow madhu jain kahati hai, kuposhan kaa sabase mukhya kaaran he pehle ghante main maa kaa doodh nahin mil paanaa, 6 maheene tak stanpan na karana, paushtik aahaar maa ko bhi lenaa padataa he lekin wo mil nahin paata, isliye hamaare yahaan kuposhit bachche zyada hai
 a talisman with red and black thread around his neck, slender limbs with submerged eyes, Maya is 11 months old, currently weighing five and a half kilos, was to be around ten
 jhaad-phoonk se vazan badhaane kii koshish hui, phir badi mushkil se maa agar-malwa ke enarasi lekar ai
 The ten-bed NRC has 16 unsupervised children admitted, including 13 girls, 3 boys
 samaaj kii manodasha he, bacchiyon ke poshan kaa aahaar to beton ko khilaa hi dete hai, unki dawaaen bhi
 Much of the story of these malnourished children begins with a distinction between sons and daughters
 ab prem bai ne aathvin tak badi beti ko padhaayaa uski shaadi kar di
 In Malwa itself, Priyanshu, two and a half years old, weighs only eight and a half kilograms, whereas should be around 12 kg, but the mother did not get admitted in NRC
 bachche anganwari nahin aana chaahate, parivaar unako aspataal main bhartee nahin karaata
 One reason for this was seen in Dindori
 kuposhan khatm karne yahaan kodo kutki paushtik anaaj se bani pattee di jaati he
 In many Anganwadi centers, it became fungal because children do not want to eat it, but the self-help groups stop it every week
 jaankaar maanate hai ki aisi berukhi se hi kuposhan khatm nahin ho rahaa he
 Social worker working for child rights Sachin Jain says that when we talk about infant mortality, it is very important that teenager girls, pregnant women and children should be looked at together
 in teenon ke mudde ko tukade-tukade main vargeekrut kar ekikrut karnaa bahut jaruri he
 Our planning is not community focused
 sarkaar maanakar chalati he ki log keval paisa maangana chaahate hai
 In fact, there may be many initiatives in which the budget is not required, such as children not getting breastfeeding immediately after birth, if additional part of maternity rights is added to the employment program then no additional budget is needed
 madhyapradesh main mahila bal vikaas mantri imarti devi se jab aankadon ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone daawa kiya ki ''apni mehnat se ve 6-7 maheene main kuposhan ko dur kar dengi, is kalank ko dur kar dengi
 Our code of conduct came to work, now the whole division is meeting
 main khud garib varg se ai hum garib bacchon ke haal jaanati hum, chote chote log mehnat mazdooree ko jate hai
 They get married early
 ve khud hi tandurust nahin honge to baccha kaise tandurust hoga
 i will show hard work in 6-7 months
 '' At the same time, the BJP, which has ruled for 15 years, is upset in 6 months, it seems that the Congress is not working properly
 purv sahakaarita mantri vishwaas saarang kehete hai ''15 saal hamaari sarkaar main hamane prayaas kiya
 We have to see the full 20 years
 hamane kai yojanaayen banaain un bacchon ke liye, lekin 6 maheene main is sarkaar ne koi dhyaan nahin diya, wo tabadalon-bhrashtachar main lagi rahi
 The poor were not on their agenda
 mantri is baat kii zyada phikr karte hai ki bangale main kitne kaa nal lage, marammat hogi
 When such a government runs, there will be such chaos
 '' madhyapradesh main sarkaar to badal gai lekin ek str ke baad 'kuposhan ke aankadon main ghotaale' par pehle vaali sarkaar chuppi saadhe rahi, to ab nai sarkaar ke liye bhi ise swikaarna mushkil he
 Everyone's effort is just data management
 vaise rajya main philhal sarkari aankadon ke mutabik 1084948 bachche madhyam kuposhit or 1,19,574 ati kuposhit hai
 The Constitution gives responsibility to protect the lives of children
 aise main kisi bhi bachche ke kuposhan or swasthya ke sankat ko hal na kar paane kii jimmedaari bhi chuni hui sarkaar kii hi hogi
 And yes, there is no official deferment between life and death
 modi sarkaar ne desh bhar ke karodon sarkari karmchaariyon ko bada tohfa diya he

 60% amount transfar kii manzoorivitt mantri ne kaha ki sarkari karmchaaree ritairement ke samay kul pension fund kaa 60 fisadi nikaal sakenge, baaki 40 fisadi kaa nivesh nishchit aay utpaadon yaa share equity main kiya ja saktaa he
 Earlier there was a provision to withdraw only 40 percent
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki yadi karmchaaree sevanivritti ke samay enpies main jamaa dhan kaa koi bhi hissaa nikaalane kaa nirnay nahin karata he or 100 fisadi pension yojana main hastantarit karata he, to uski pension antim baar praapt vetan kaa 50 fisadi se adhik hogi
 What is NPS? Actually, National Pension Scheme (NPS) is a retirement savings account
 isaki shuruyaat bharat sarkaar ne 1 janvari, 2004 ko kii thi
 Earlier this scheme was started for government employees only
 haalanki 2009 ke baad ise nijee kshetra ke karmchaariyon ke liye bhi shuru kiya gaya he
 Please tell here that the minimum age for opening an NPS account is 18 years and the maximum age is 65 years

 tamaam baaten hui lekin takreeban sava 2 saal baad rahul gandhi ne ishaaron-ishaaron main bataa diya ki vah chuttee par nahin balki vipashyana karne gaye the
 Rahul said- Initially i felt foolish
 Diarahul said, when i was 26 years old, i went to Burmese to Vipassana for the first time
 In the first 3 days i felt that i was made a fool
 lekin chhodkar jane se pehle maine janaa or mana ki sab ke bare main sochane ke alaava aapako din main 5-10 minute khud ke bare main sochna chahie, tabhi aap desh ke vikaas ke bare main ranneeti tay kar paaenge
 After which i again forgot my point and completed the course
 rahul bole ki apane bare main sochane kii baat thi jisane mujhe waapas vipashayna kii taraf bhej diya or aahista aahista main vipashyana kaa mureed ho gaya
 Rahul said, 'I tell you the last time i went for Vipassana, i was in a dilemma
 sochaa ki 2014 main badi haar kii vajah rahul gandhi he, ye jaanakar maansik tanaav hua
 Just kept wondering if my politics is wrong, but then in response Rahul said - When i went to Burmese to do Vipassana and i asked there what i should do, the answer came that i have not done Vipassana or penance for a long time
 You are confused
 '26 saal kii umr main vipashyana kii shuruyatcongress ke sutara kehete hai ki jab rahul gandhi 2014 kii badi haar ke baad videsh yatra par gaye the or kaha gaya tha ki vah chuttee par he

 20 years ago, at the age of 26, Rahul Gandhi started Vipassana at the age of 26, when Rahul initially wanted to run away, but the idea of thinking on his own stopped him
 baad main 2014 kii siyaasi badi haar ke baad rahul kya bolnaa chaahate the?isliye badale-badale dikh rahe hai congress upaadhyakshavipashyana ke baad rahul ne khud tay kiya ki main nahin jo maine bhartiya raajnneeti or bhartiya janata ke lihaaj se tay kar rakhaa tha usamen jamini hakeekat ko istemaal karke aage badho

 com / 3caywq7tl6 — IOS Boxing (@iosboxing) August 5, 2017 narayan sai aakhir dilli police ke hathe chadh gaya or is tarah 58 din se police ke saath chalaa aa rahaa chuuhe-billi kaa khel khatm ho gaya
 Like his father Asaram, Sai was surrounded by a raft of allegations of sexual misconduct, dodging the police of several states before his arrest
 kabhi khabar ai ki vah clin shev karake agra main ek bhakt ke yahaan pahunchaa he or ek sim card kii maang kar rahaa he
 So sometimes an incident came to light that he is running in an SUV on the Yamuna Expressway
 jab police ne gaadi rokane kii koshish kii to filmi andaaj main driver chaalaan ke 100 ru
 Throwed out and ran away
 police uske saaye tak ko nahin chhu paa rahi thi
 This time too, he was trying to run away as a junkie wearing a jeans-t-shirt and orange turban, but he could not break the trap of Gujarat and Delhi Police this time
 darasal dilli police ko suraag laga tha ki narayan sai bhesh badalakar punjab ke ludhiana main chipa hua he
 In view of this, a team of 10 officers was sent from Delhi to Ludhiana on 2 December
 dilli police ke liye yah pratishthapurna mishan tha
 So, on the next day i
e
 December 3, 20 more officers left for Ludhiana so that the sai would not leave any place
 lekin khud ko bhagwaan liladhar krishna ke bahuroopie ke taur par andhabhakton ke bich pesh karata rahaa narayan sai police kii karrwai ko tad gaya
 He escaped from Ludhiana
 ab police dilli se punjab kii ore or sai sardaar ke bhesh main punjab se dilli ke raste par tha
 All the board was set right, but by then the police also got a glimpse of this Sai's move
 darasal police ko pataa chalaa ki upi 15 number se shuru hone vaali ford iko sport car ek petrol pump par dekhi gai he
 The police changed tactics and surrounded the vehicle at 10 pm in Pipli village of Kurukshetra on National Highway No-1
 gaadi ke bheetar jo shaks mila usase police kii baanchhein khil gayi
 This person was Narayan Sai
 uske saath uskaa bharosemand driver ramesh, anya saathi kaushal urf hanuman or sai ke liye khaanaa banane vaala ek naaballig ladkaa uske saath the
 When the police caught Sai, she did not have a wrinkle on her face, but a vicious smile
 apane pita kii hi tarah naach-naachakar pravachan dene vaale sai ne giraftaar ke baad bhi police ko chakaana nahin choda
 Delhi Police says that Narayan Sai is not cooperating in the investigation since his arrest
 kisi bhi sawaal ke jawaab par sirf hans rahaa he
 But in the circumstances in which he has fallen, it does not seem that the father-son has much more left to laugh and smile
 vaise narayan sai kii giraftaar jitani sidhi dikh rahi he, utani sidhi he nahin
 He was arrested for a full 52 days after the warrant was issued from the Surat court
 surat court kaa aadesh tha ki agar 10 disambar tak sai hajir nahin hota he to uski sampatti jabt kar lee jaae
 On top of that, the Gujarat Police paid five lakh kaa inaam rakh choda tha
 In such a situation, the police have been killed just before the order of confiscation of the property
 sai par surat kii do bahanon ne aarope lagaaya he ki 2002 se 2005 ke bich usne unka yon shoshan kiya
 This charge is one of the charges against Asaram and Sai from all over the country
 40 saal ke sai par aaropon kii lambii qatari he
 The wife of a man who has said that he kept himself away from addiction and lust since childhood, has started opening his wife living apart from him
 uski patni ne gujarat police ko bataaya ki narayan sai lagaataar mahilaon se nazaij rishte rakhata rahaa he or isi ke chalate vah apane bete ke saath alag rah rahi he
 The wife alleged that Sai has an illicit relationship with a servant in the ashram and she also has a child
 ashram kii ek anya sevika ne bhi sai kii patni ke aarope kii pushti kii he
 In a recent police statement, the sai victim and a woman associated with the ashram said that sai used to use luxury cars and helicopter rides to woo women
 par aisa bhi nahin ki asaram kaa rangeen mizaaj betaa sirf duusari auraton se taalluk rakhane ke liye hi betaab tha
 He also has a serious allegation that he was fond of mass intercourse
 us par lag rahe aaropon kaa silsilaa jaise-jaise aage badhata jaataa he, usase hairat hoti he ki ye baap-bete sirf yon shoshan hi karte the yaa inhen puja-paath kaa dhong karne ke liye vakt bhi miltaa tha
 Actually Narayan Sai wanted to do everything that his father Asaram had
 or bataate hai, halaat yahaan tak pahunch gaye the ki asaram ke samrajya par kabja karne ke liye vah apane baap tak ko fansaane kii firaaq main tha
 Since both father and son were hungry for lust, Sai thought why not prepare the CD of Asaram and capture Asaram's property and throne as soon as possible by blackmailing him
 vah jaanata tha ki asaram kii kisi sadhika ke saath aapattijanak mudra main sidi banavaakar vah bahut aasaani se apane iraade main kaamyaab ho saktaa he
 But before he could do this trick, before that a girl in Delhi got FIR registered and accused Asaram of sexual misconduct
 yah aarope pataakhon kii ladi main tili lagane vaala sabit hua
 After that, both Asaram and Narayan Sai came to be accused of illegal possession of land, cheating, sexual abuse and rape
 chunki narayan sai par darj taaja maamla gujarat ke surat shahar kaa he, aise main dilli police kii ore se use dilli kii rohinee court main pesh karne par court ne sai ko surat police kii hiraasat main saunp diya
 After Sai's arrest, the path of further allegations against the father-son is also clearing up
 donon chautarafa ninda jhel rahe hai, lekin is daur main bhi is desh main aise logon kii kami nahin he jo baap-bete main ab bhi sant kaa ansh dekhte hai or unke paksh main khadey hone ke liye taiyaar hai
 This belief of blind devotees was also shown in the court premises in Jodhpur
 vahaan peshi ke liye aae asaram se jab poocha gaya ki kya aapako narayan sai kii giraftaar kaa pataa he?to is buudhe baba ne kaha, ‘‘mujhe nahin pataa
 Time will make everything right

 'the court made the remark last year after studying an inquiry report filed by the Ministry of External Affairs regarding the move of Ansal's application for a passport from pre-verification to post-verification status
 adaalat ne yah bhi kaha ki yah bhi nahin bataaya gaya he ki satyaapan purv darja ko kis tarah satyaapan uparaant darja main tabdeel kar diya gaya or unke passport aavedan par lagaaye gaye roak kii andekhi kar di gai, jabaki dilli police ne unke bare main kshetreey passport karyaalay ko do pratikul reportein bheji thi

 baharhaal, adaalat ne sarkaar ke vakil kii daleelein sunne ke baad is vishay kii agali taarikh 26 sitambar tay kar di
 Significantly, the Delhi Police has lodged an FIR against Ansal and the police officers who gave the verification report in his favor on the court's direction last year

 ucchtam nyaayalay ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki saal 2013 kaa lokapal or lokayukta kanoon vyavhaarik he or iskaa kriyanvayan latakaakar rakhana nyaaysangat nahin he
 According to this law, the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha will be part of the Lokpal selection panel
 is samay loksabhaa main koi netaa pratipaksh nahin he
 Referring to an earlier verdict of the apex court, a bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and Justice Naveen Sinha said, "we say it is practical and it is not justifiable to hang it
" desh main lokapal kii niyukti kii maang karne vaali yachikaaon par sheersh adaalat ne 28 march ko apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 Earlier, senior advocate Shanti Bhushan, appearing for the NGO Common Cause, said that although the Parliament passed the Lokpal Bill in 2013 and it came into force in the year 2014, the government is still not deliberately appointing the Lokpal
 atorni general mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki maujuuda sthiti main lokapal ko niyukt nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki lokapal kanoon main netaa pratipaksh kii paribhaasha se jude sanshodhan sansad main lambit pade hai

 upi ke purv siem akhilesh yadav kaa phir se samaajawaadee party kaa rashtriya adhyaksh bananaa lagbhag tay he or 5 oktober ko agra ke rashtriya adhiveshan unhen dobaaraa rashtriya adhyaksh chun liya jayega
 This time the seal of Akhilesh Yadav becoming the national president will be put up at the national convention
 rashtriya adhyaksh banane ke pehle abhi party or parivaar main ghamaasan kaa ek or round baaki he
 If the sources are to be believed, then Mulayam Singh Yadav, who is waiting for Akhilesh's change of heart, can now finally seal the script of Shivpal Yadav
 chunaav haarane ke baadamulaayam sinhayadav ko yakeen tha ki unase chhina gaya rashtriya adhyaksh kaa pad der-saver akhilesh yadav waapas kar denge, lekin jis tareeke se akhilesh yadav ne party par apni pakad majboot kar lee he or jis tarah se lagaataar mulaayam singh kii andekhi hui he
 After this, Mulayam Singh Yadav is now on the way to take the final decision
 lekin yah faisla kya hoga
 Will a separate party be formed? Will there be a separate forum? Or will there be a front? These leaves are neither opening Mulayam Singh Yadav nor Shivpal Yadav
 inke paas har sawaal kaa bas ek hi jawaab he 25 sitambar kaa intjaar kiijie us din mulaayam singh yadav bada press conference kar elaan karenge
 Preparations for the State Conference The preparations for the 8th State Conference of the Samaj Samajwadi Party have been completed

 sammelan main rajnatik or aarthik prastaav par charchaa hogi
 The state president will be elected at 4:30 pm
 shaam 5 baje ramgopal yadav sammelan kaa samaapan karenge
 In the eyes of Mulayam, what will Mulayam Singh announce on September 25? Will he break political relations with Akhilesh? Will he announce a new party? What will they do? Everyone's eyes are on this vahiin shivpal yadav ke camp ko ummid he ki ab samaajawaadee party ko lekar tamaam ummiden khatm ho chuki he or alag rasta chunanaa hi ekmaatr rasta bachaa he
 What is left between your father and son is predicted from the meeting of two offices of Vikramaditya Marg on 21 September

 Akhilesh was increasing his strength before the National Session, Akhilesh was inducting BSP leader Indrajit Saroj in the crowd of thousands and Mulayam Singh Yadav was taking leave of Ram Gopal Yadav from the post of Secretary of Lohia Trust
 shivpal camp maanakar chal rahaa he ki mulaayam singh yadav 25 sitambar ko nai party kaa elaan karenge
 After that all such socialists can be added who are angry with Akhilesh
 mulaayam singh yadav ke kareebi netaaon ne iske sanket dene shuru bhi kar die hai
 In such a situation, on 25th, all eyes will rest on Mulayam Singh, what decision he makes
 shivpal yadav pichley kai maheenon se alag morche kii baat kar rahe hai jabaki unke samarthakon kaa dabaav alag party banane kaa ha, taaki sidhe-sidhe akhilesh yadav ko chunauti di ja sake
 At the same time, considering Mulayam Singh's old record at the last moment, it would not be right to speculate at the moment

 In response to a question asked about Mulayam Singh at the press conference on Wednesday, Akhilesh said that Mulayam is his father but the matter of politics is different at the moment
 baharhaal mulaayam singh hameshaa ummiido ke vipareet faisla lene vaale maane jate rahe hai, aise main adhyaksh pad dobaaraa nahin milane par mulaayam kya faisla lete hai isapar sabaki nazar rahegi
 Now RK Pachauri, director general of The Energy and Research Institute, has raised questions on the policies of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal 
 unka kahana he ki kejariwal kaa uddeshy beshak acha he, magar use puraa karne ke tareeke sahi nahin hai
 For this, they (kejriwal government) have to understand the whole economics
 ek intervyuu main pachori ne kaha, 'iraade bahut achche hai, lekin main is bare main aashwast nahin hum ki yah lakshya hasil karne kaa behtareen tarika he
 In terms of water and electricity, you have to look at the whole economics of water supply and electricity supply
 ' pachori se ‘aam aadmi party’ sarkaar kii pani or bijli kii nitiyon ke bare main poocha gaya tha
 He said, 'you also need to ensure that you are improving the system, so that waste and leakage can be prevented and water quality is improved at every level
 ab, agar aap koi aapurti muft karne ja rahe hai, to uskaa sahi tareeke se istemaal karne ke liye aap kya kar rahe hai
 This will lead to waste of water
 Pachouri said that if 600 or 700 liters of water is given to the people for free, then how can they be expected to use it properly
 varsh 2002 se jalwaayu parivartan par antar sarkari panel ke adhyaksh rahe pachori ne kaha 'yah arthshaastra kaa bahut hi moolbhoot paksh he
 People have to understand that if they are using something and it is lacking, then it will have to be used economically
 'ek taraf muft or duusari taraf mahangaa pani‘aap’ kii nitiyon par apni tippaniyon main unhone kaha, 'maine yah pehle bhi kaha he, main maafee chaahunga
 i respect and wholeheartedly appreciate the intentions, but i am not convinced that these are the best ways to achieve the goals that they want to accomplish
 ' satta main aane ke 48 ghante ke andar, arvind kejariwal nit sarkaar ne 30 janvari ko 667 litre pani prayek ghar ko muft aapurti karne kaa vaada to puraa kiya, lekin isaki daron main 10 fisadi kii vruddhi bhi kar di
 It is important to pay attention to the quality of water
 The President of TERI said, "when you talk about water, it is not just the water that is to be supplied in a fixed quantity, but also includes a certain level of quality and the reason why It is that a city like Delhi has to depend on bottled water
 hamen aisa pine kaa pani chahie jo ham nal se lene ke baad bina kisi dar ke pi saken
 Pachauri hoped that the present Delhi government and administration would ensure water quality improvement, so that people would not have to buy water sealed in plastic bottles
 plastic na keval pradooshan badhaata he balki bottleband pani nirdhantam logon kii pahunch se baahar bhi he
 The government alone was not guilty in the matter of pollution
 It was said in the news that Delhi is the most polluted city in the world
 is bare main poochne par pachori ne kaha, 'main kahuunga ki yah durbhagyapurna he or mujhe ummid he ki ise sudhara ja saktaa he
 i hope that late people will realize the importance of clean air, clean water
 'yel vishvavidhyalay dwaara jari ‘envyranmental parformens index 2014’ main 178 deshon kii suchi main bharat kaa sthaan 155waan he
 Pachauri said, "this is a case of collective failure
 ham sarkaar par dosha nahin madh sakate or sarkaar yah nahin kah sakati ki log is mudde par samvedansheel nahin hai
 'he said,' Our institutions were missed and there is incomplete information in the public as well, which in my opinion resulted in a collective failure
 main maanata hum ki hamen hamaare sabhi sansthaanon par punarvichaar kii jarurat he, hamen yah sunishchit karne kii jarurat he ki sabhi paksh jaagruk hon, taaki inamen se kuch samasyaon kaa ham miljulkar samaadhaan hasil kar saken
 Pachauri called for the inclusion of environmental and climate change issues in the manifestos of political parties before the general elections and to place them on the political agenda

 unhone aap supremeo arvind kejariwal par tanj kasate hue kaha kikumar vishwasbhole ki yuddh kaa ek niyam hota he, shaheedon ke shav se chhedchhad nahin kii jaati he
 Without your (arvind Kejriwal) wish nothing happens there, it is quite difficult to survive in the party by disagreeing with you
 saath hi vishwaas bole ki arvind ne kaha tha maarenge par shahid nahin hone denge
 Now Kumar Vishwas is a 'martyr' or 'killed', this will tell the time to come
 lekin aam aadmi party main kinare laga die gaye netaaon kii sankhya kam nahin hai
 Many old leaders have rebelled in the Aam Aadmi Party
 kejariwal kaa saath chhodkar ja chuke netaaon main party ke kai sansthaapak sadsy bhi shaamil hai
 In the Aam Aadmi Party, there were earlier 'civil wars', in which many leaders, Arvind Kejriwal himself pulled out to protest, due to which he got the status of 'martyr'
 vahiin kisi ko party se beizzat karke yani 'markar' nikaala gaya
 After that, those leaders resigned themselves and moved closer to the other party
 aaie jaanate hai koun the wo aap ke purv netaa jo 'shahid' hue yaa jinhen 'maut' hasil hui
 The former law minister was Shanti Bhushan, a senior advocate of the Supreme Court who was the first to donate to the martyr Shanti Bhushan Aam Aadmi Party
 shanti bhushan ne party kii sthapana par 1 karod rupye kaa chanda diya tha
 However, he was disillusioned with AAP since 2014
 unhone kejariwal par anubhavheen, dilli vidhansabha chunaavon main tikat bantwaare main gadabadi, party main manamaani chalaane jaise kai aarope lagaae the
 Shanti Bhushan was among the oldest to leave the party

 Yogendra and Prashant Bhushan split from the party
 donon netaa aam aadmi party ke sansthaapak sadasyon main se the, lekin kejariwal ne donon ko party se baahar kar diya
 Yogendra and Prashant formed a group called Swaraj Abhiyan and decided to fight in Delhi

 But he did not get the expected success

 Anand Kumar, Mayank Gandhi, Medha Patkar and Anjali Damania Apart from this, social activists associated with Kejriwal since the time of Anna movement also objected to the way Arvind was working
 inamen soshal activist mayank gandhi, saamaajik kaaryakarta medha patkar or anjali daamaniya pramukh hai
 Sociologist Anand Kumar also participated in the anti-corruption movement along with Yogendra and Prashant

 He contested the Lok Sabha elections from north-east Delhi on behalf of the party and finished second
 unhen bhi party virdohi gatividhiyon ke aarope main aap se baahar nikaala gaya

 He was also the party chief in Maharashtra
 unhone prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav ko party se baahar karne par bhi sawaal khadey kiye the
 He resigned from the party citing Kejriwal for withdrawing from politics of honesty, using activists to leave him and losing interest in politics

 2015 main arvind kejariwal par congressi saansadon ko kharidne kaa aarope laga to unhone party chhod di
 Disgraced Vinod Kumar Binny, Shazia Ilmi and Kapil Mishra 'death' Kapil Mishra, who was a minister in the government in Delhi, sensationally accused Kejriwal of taking two crore bribes
 2017 kii garmiyon main kapil mishra or kejariwal team ke bich jabardast jang chalati rahi
 Kapil had the support of Kumar Vishwas and the struggle gradually increased
 baad main kapil mishra bijepi kii ore khiskate gaye or vivaad mand padataa gaya
 But the silence in the whole case proved Kejriwal to be a silent killer for Kapil Mishra
 saath hi kapil mishra ko suspend kar party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 Vinod Kumar Binny, who first started a rebellion against Kejriwal, raised his voice against the Aam Aadmi Party's surveyors and challenged him in the election fray as well
 kabhi dilli main kejariwal ke saath milakar raajnneeti karne vaale binni ne kejariwal kii pehali sarkaar main mantri pad na milane ke baad bagawati sur apana liye the
 After this, when the party did not get a ticket for the next election, they opened a front against the top leadership of the party
 baad main binni ko party se nilambit kar diya
 Vinod Kumar Binny and Kapil Mishra's political careers are not doing well after being expelled from the party

 Gautam Chatterjee, Additional Principal Secretary for Transport and Ports, said that running trains on the poles means that corridor fencing would not be needed, which is necessary to prevent the common man and animals from coming under its purview
 tippaniyan He said, "the elevated corridor, which we are considering, will eliminate the problem of acquiring huge plots, making underground passageways for animals, people and vehicles
 saath hi pare galiyare kii fensing kii jarurat bhi nahin hogi taaki pashu or log is daayre main na ghus aaen
 "however, the cost of the project will increase by Rs 10,000 crore in this manner," he said

 ' aisa ham sabane filmon main dekha he lekin hindi film kaa ye geet hakeekat main badalata najar aa rahaa he bihar ke darbhanga main
 Something similar is happening here with two twin brothers
 ek ko chot lagati he doosraa dard se karaah uthta he
 If one is beaten, the other also feels pain
 filmi kahani ko hakeekat badalte dekh darbhanga ke log hairaan hai
 Something similar is happening with Doojudwa Bachhelava and Kush of Runam Jha in Nawada Rampur village of Baheda police station area of darbhanga district
 aisa hone se na keval lav or kush ke parivaar vaale hairaan or pareshaan hai balki darbhanga ke doctor bhi is ghatana par achambhit hai
 At the age of 7, Kelav and Kushki are also almost identical
 filmi kahani agar asal jindagi main hakeekat main badalane lage to hairaani kii baat to hogi hi
 If Love becomes ill, Kush also gets fever
 kisi ek ko khaansee ho jaae to duusare ko bhi cheenk aane lagati he
 If the brother breaks the bone, then the other brother also breaks
 aisa sanyog ek baar ho saktaa he lekin baar-baar aisa hi hone ko kya kah sakate hai
 According to lun-kush's mother Runam Jha, it is not a coincidence but such incidents are equal with Lov and Kush
 runam jha kaa kahana he ki haddi tuutane kii hi ghatana kai baar in donon ke saath ho chuki he
 Doctors are also surprised
 Doctor CN Saraf, who is treating children, is also surprised to see this incident
 unka kahana he ki yah to shodh kaa vishay he
 Doctor Sarraf says that there can be similarities in many things when there are twins, but in ortho such incidents are not possible from anywhere
 aisa hona nishchit rup se shodh karne kaa vishay he
 Love and Kush's mother is always worried about this kind of incident
 unka kahana he ki lav-kush ko lekar wo doctor se lekar bhagwaan tak darbar main mattha tech chuki hai
 But the problem is not taking the name of being less

 In alliance with Shivsena, BJP first gave its Lok Sabha seat to Shiv Sena
 ab bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav (loksabha Elections) main apana palghar kaa saansad bhi ummidavaar ke taur par shivasena ko de diya he
 BJP MP Rajendra Gavit from Palghar seat will now contest on Shiv Sena ticket
 rajendra gavit ko shivabandhan baandhakar shivasena main shaamil kiya gaya
 Gavit was in the Congress before joining the BJP
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne bataaya ki 'bijepi se gathbandhan main palghar seat hamaare hisse main ai he, saath main ummidavaar bhi aa gaya
 Together we have decided this
 ' uddhav ne iske pehle bijepi ke purv saansad swargeey chintamani vanagaa ke bete shrinivas vanagaa ko saansad banane kaa vachan diya tha par ab shrinivas ne saansad ke bajaay vidhayak banane kii ichha jataai he isliye rajendra gavit ko shivasena kii taraf se loksabhaa kaa ummidavaar banaaya gaya he
 Palghar seat has been the stronghold of Chintamani Onega, a former BJP MP, but in the elections held after his death, BJP had given ticket to Rajendra Gavit from Congress and also won
 tab shivasena ne chintamani vanagaa ke bete shrinivas vanagaa ko ummidavaar banaaya tha
 But now after the alliance with Shiv sena-bjp, Shiv Sena gave Rajendra Gavit a ticket in place of Srinivas
 shivasena ne aaj shrinivas ko party ke mukhyalay 'matoshri' bulaayaa tha
 There, Uddhav Thackeray convinced Srinivas to be a political multiplication and then announced the name of Gavit

 The government said that there were serious allegations against him and there is no politics in it
 vipaksh kaa kahana he ki isamen pratishodh kii bu aati he
 Senior Congressmen said that if they were to be sacked, why did they transfer from Gujarat? The statement of the government that he had serious allegations is true

 Actually it was part of his plot
 is tarah se vah congress alaakaman ko yah dikhaanaa chaahati thim ki unhone mukhyamantri narendra modi ko pareshaan karne main koi kasar nahin chodi he
 Due to this, they continued to get accolades and the same happened

 However, the dismissal of two governors has given rise to many questions
 sabase pehla sawaal he ki kya hamen rajyapalon kii jarurat bhi he? mehalon jaise gharon main dheron karindon se ghire rajyapalon kii utpaadakta kya he? unke bhrasht aacharan kii jaanch koun or kaise karegaa? bihar or jharkhand ke rajyapalon par bhrashtachar ke gambhir aarope lage
 Many governors were told that they took away the valuables and carpets kept in the Raj Bhavan
 aise rajyapalon ke khilaaf kya karrwai kii jaae
 The rights of governors have been discussed for a long time but no action has been taken on them
 kamala beniwal kii barkhaastagi ke baad ab vakt aa gaya he ki sabhi prashnon par vistaar se vichaar ho
 Once thought seriously whether we should maintain this very expensive and expensive post which is used to fulfill the hobbies of the old leaders and is given to them as a reward of loyalty to the party or to prevent them from being rebellious
 is? It is to be hoped that the new government will consider it seriously and without politics

 Mansoor Ali Khan as Nawab Pataudi, Indian cricket on Thursday lost a keen human, talented player and visionary captain
 'tiger' naam se mashhoor pataudi ne sar gangaaraam aspataal main guuruuvaar shaam ko antim sal lee
 He was suffering from a serious lung infection
 vah 70 varsh ke the
 Pataudi has been one of the few players who first established a direct relationship between cricket and Bollywood
 apane jamaane kii mashhoor abhinetri sharmila tagore ke saath vivaah karne vaale pataudi ne apane pita nawab pataudi senior ke madhyam se bachapan se lekar javaani tak cricket ko jitna jiya, usase kahin adhik unhone apni abhinetri patni, abhinayta putr saf ali khan or putree soha ali khan ke madhyam se bollywood ko mahasoos kiya
 Pataudi is considered the visionary captain of Indian cricket
 yahi kaaran he ki 1961 main apane test kariyar kii shuruyaat karne ke saath captaini kii jimmedaari sweekaar karne vaale pataudi ne kul 46 match khele or 40 main team kaa netritv kiya
 Pataudi, who was made captain in his fourth Test match, will not be wrong if he is called the best captain of Indian cricket
 pataudi 21 varsh kii umr main barbados main westeindies ke khilaaf 1962 main captain banaae gaye the kyonki niyamit captain nari kantrector tej gendbaaj charlie griffith kii ek gend par chotil hone ke kaaran aspataal main ilaaj kara rahe the
 In this way, Pataudi got the privilege of becoming the youngest captain of Indian cricket
 unka yah ricard 2004 tak kaayam rahaa
 Pataudi, who captained the county club Sussex and the Oxford University team, had lost his eye in an accident, but despite a fake eye, Pataudi never took up arms at any level and remained the quintessential, intellectual and visionary face of Indian cricket
 pataudi kii dekharekh main bhartiya team ne kul nau test match jite the
 It was her tenure when the Indian team was convinced that she too could win
 yah kaaphi kuch saurav ganguli ke captaini ke kaarykaal jaisaa tha, jab bhartiya team ne desh or videsh main sabhi tiimon ko haraaya
 Pataudi gave Indian cricket the confidence to depend on spin art, its greatest strength
 pataudi maanate the ki bhartiya spinner kisi bhi team ko dharashayi kar sakate hai or yahi kaaran he ki unhone ek match main ek se adhik spinner ko khilaane kii niti ko badhaava diya
 As a batsman, Pataudi did not achieve a great feat, but given his level of inspiring work as a captain, his figures look even more impressive
 pataudi ne 46 test maichon main 34
 He scored 2793 runs at an average of 91, including six centuries
 203 ran, jo 1964 main dilli main england ke khilaaf banaae the, unka shreshth score bana rahaa
 Studied in a prestigious educational institution like Oxford, Pataudi had all the qualities of a noble clan
 vah 1971 tak haryana ke kareeb sthit pataudi ke nawab the
 Pataudi was respected as a king until the Government of India dissolved the power of the royalty in 1971 by amending the constitution, but Pataudi ruled the Indian public through cricket

 Lo que convierte a Sac Actun en la cueva sumergida más grande del mundo
 El director de exploración del proyecto Gran Acuífero Maya, Robert Schmittner y un equipo de buzos de cuevas, entre los que destacan Marty o Farrell, Jim Josiak y Sev Regehr, comenzaron esta fase del proyecto en marzo de 2017; aunque, Schmittner lleva 14 años buscando esta conexión y añadiendo nuevos túneles y galerías a este laberinto acuático
 Sin duda ahora el reto será de todos: conservar esta maravillosa cueva
 Tulum se ha convertido en la meca del buceo de cuevas en el planeta, exploradores subacuáticos de diversas latitudes, han dedicado gran parte de su vida a recorrer las entrañas de esta maravillosa tierra
 Entre ellos Bil Phillips, pionero de la exploración del acuífero maya, quien fundó junto con James Coke, el Quintana Roo Speleological Survey, una base de datos con mapas detallados de estos complejos sistemas y que hoy son una herramienta valiosa para entender y proteger el acuífer 
 Bil Phillips exploró hasta los últimos días de su vida este maravilloso mundo subacuático
 Durante más de 40 años se consagró a comprender el acuífero a través de la investigación de estas aguas ancestrales
 El equipo del GAM le dedica este importante y valioso logro a Bil Phillips, quien fuera el cartógrafo subacuático del proyecto y quien falleció en noviembre de 2017

 During the hearing on this matter, the Delhi High Court questioned the petitioner whether there is any provision in the law under which the court is empowered to give these instructions
 lekin yachikakarta ke paas koi jawaab naa hone par court ne kaha ki hamaare paas koi bhi aisa kanoonee adhikaar nahin he
 Under which we can issue such guidelines
 bataa den ki yeyachikawakil bijendra sangwan kii taraf se daayar kii gai thi
 The petitioner had requested the court to grant martyr status to freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru
 yachika main kaha gaya ki teenon ko 1931 main angrejon ne faansee de di gai thi
 Martyrs have the legal right to be given martyr status and this will be a true tribute to the martyrs on behalf of the country
 yachika main bataaya gaya he ki 1928 main bhagat singh or raajaguru ne pakistan ke lahore main ek british police afasar ko goli maar di thi or isi ke baad lord irvin kii cameti kii siforeeshon par special tribunel ne bhagat singh, sukhdev or raajaguru ko lahore kijel main faanseeper chadha diya tha
 a petition has been filed in the High Court on behalf of the university in connection with the recent demolition of students and hostage of staff in jnu's Admin Block
 is par sunwaayee karte hue dilli hai court ne shuukravaar ko jeenyu chaatr sangh ke netaaon ko notice jari kiya he
 The court said that for the next 2 days, the students cannot protest in front of the Admin block, as it is a violation of the previous orders of the court
 iske alaava hoicourt ne jeenyu prashasan ko nirdesh die hai ki agar chaatro ke pradarshan se halaat bekaabu hote dikhen to kanoon vyavastha banaae rakhane ke liepulice kii madad lee jaae
 Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, appearing for JNU in the hearing, said that the court order is that students cannot perform in 100 meters radius in and around the Admin block
 lekin uske baavjood naa sirf chaatro ne pradarshit kiya balki admin block main maujuud karmchaariyon ko bandhak banaakar rakhaa
 The condition of some of the people who had been kept hostage for a long time was so bad that the ambulance had to be called, but the students did not even allow the ambulance to enter
 court ne apane aadesh main kaha he ki chaatro ko agar shantipurna pradarshan karnaa he to vah sabarmati lon main karen
 Students are opposing the order to make 75% of the attendance mandatory following the recommendations of the UGC
 uniwarsity ne kaha aisa ujisi ke nirdesh par kiya gaya he
 The court will hear the matter again on Tuesday, but before that in its order on Friday, the High Court has made it clear that the students will not encircle the VC, Registrar or JNU campus anywhere during their performance
 duniyabar main aaj cycle diwas manaaya ja rahaa he
 Everybody is appealing to the people to use the bicycle by giving the cries of environment
 isse aap feet bhi rahenge or hit bhi
 But beyond this formula of fit and hit, the day of June 3 for 'cycle' in Indian politics was nothing memorable
 loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar ke baad jab bahujan samaaj party (BSP) kii pramukh mayawati samiksha karne baithi to unka gussa samaajawaadee party par jamkar niklaa
 Mayawati admitted in her meeting that people did not like the alliance of elephants and bicycles, the mistake was more from the bicycles
 mayawati ne aarope lagaaya he ki cycle chalaane vaale netaa hi apane ghar main jeet kaa deepak nahin jala sake to unke votaron se kya ummid ho
 In fact, before the Lok Sabha elections, when there were reports that the SP-BSP could come together by forgetting the 25-year old rivalry, it was considered a big change in Indian politics
 har koi kah rahaa tha ki sapa-basapa ke is formule se paar paanaa bhartiya janata party ke liye aasaan nahin hoga
 But on the mantra of namo-namo, the Bharatiya Janata Party was so confident that they were determined that the SP-BSP is bound to break
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne khud is baat kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi ki 23 may ke baad SP-BSP ke saath kii ulti ginati shuru ho jaaegi
 The bicycle and the elephant came together, weighed a little and then it was decided that the bicycle would remain small and the elephant would become the elder brother
 lekin isi saal janvari main shuru hua ye saath, 6 maheene ke baad hi adhar main aa pahunchaa he
 The results in the Lok Sabha elections proved to be completely contrary to expectations, the BSP, which contested in 38 seats, lost only 5 seats and the SP, which fought in 37 seats
 mayawati kii tikhi bayaanbaji se is saath par sawaal khadey hone lage hai
 During the campaigning for the Lok Sabha elections, it was promised that this will last till the 2022 assembly elections
 haalanki, ab jis tarah se sanket mil rahe hai usase 2022 kaa mishan to bahut dur hi lag rahaa he
 Now just to see whether the alliance will go ahead or not and it will also be seen whether the cycle wheel will come out first or the elephant will say goodbye to the bicycle ride first

 aisi hi kahani he motiveshnal spikar malvika ayyar kii
 17 years ago a little girl wanted to fix a torn jeans with the help of glue
 jiske liye vah kuch talash rahi thi jo is kaam main uski madad kar sake
 For this, the girl ran fast to her home garage and found something that would work for her
 haalanki,us ladki ke liye isse badi koi bhul nahin ho sakati thi
 Actually, the girl who took it in her hand was nothing but a grenade
 ghar ke aas-paas rahe gola-barood ke dippo me hue visphot ke chalate grenade ghar ke garaj tak aa gaya tha
 Unfortunately the grenade exploded as soon as it came in contact with the gum and the girl lost both her hands and sustained several injuries on her body
 aaj bhi malvika yaad karti hai ki us vakt sab ne ye soch liya tha ki ab is bacchee kii jindagi khatm ho jaaegi
 Malvika Iyer, 30, tweeted on Tuesday, World Disabled Day, "17 years ago when i was in bed in the hospital i heard some women whispering: 'did you see that girl in the General Ward? How sad! Surely someone must have cursed this girl, this girl's life is over now '
 " bataa den ki malvika ayyar ek motiveshnal spikar hai, jinhen mahilaon ke sarvocch nagirak sammaan se raashtrapati dwaara sammanit kiya ja chukaa he
 It is clear that what the women had said at the time for Malavika in the hospital did not prove to be true
 That was the very first time i cried my eyes out
 Not when i saw my amputated arms covered in blood
 Not when i saw the doctors drilling iron rods inside my leg
 Not when i was battling for my dear life
 malvika ne apni 10veen kii pariksha chennai se kii, yahi nahin unhone rajya str par rank bhi hasil kii
 Please tell malvika ko raashtrapati apije kalam dwaara milane ke liye raashtrapati bhawan aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 Malvika did her further education from Delhi where she obtained a bachelor's degree in economics from St
 Stephens College
 iske baad unhone dilli vishvidhyalay ke hi dilli skool of soshal works se post grajuation kiya
 As of today, Malvika has given speeches as a Motivational speaker around the world and has also attended many workshops
 ve apane hi jaise duusare logon ko prerit karti hai or sandesh detii hai ki unki tarah har koi baadhaon se upar uthakar jivan sein safalataa hasil kar saktaa he
 However, it would not be right to measure Malavika's success in just one way, by visiting her Twitter profile, we will know that she is a bomb blast Survivor, awarded with National Honor, Motivational speaker, activist working for the disabled , Is also the World Economic Global Forum speaker
 iske alaava jagannatha shriram ne malvika par ek graphic novel taiyaar kiya he jo unke jindagi ke safar ke bare main bataata he

 When Rupert Murdoch appeared before the parliamentary committee on 19 July, his first words were: "this is the most degrading day of my life
" '' yah bayaan unhone us ghatana se pehle diya jab unke peeche baithe ek vyakti ne unke chehre par shaving fom malane kaa prayaas kiya
 But in the style of the protector, his powerful wife, Wendy Deng, sitting behind him, beat the man fiercely
 is apratyaashit ghatana ne thode samay ke liye logon kaa dhyaan banta diya
 The incident — dubbed by those writing the headlines as "hambal Pai" (forced to apologize) — distracted the attention of 80-year-old media mogul and his son and successor James Murdoch for a short time
 gave
 pehali baar is tarah kii kisi poochtacha ke liye jane ke liye murdoch taiyaar hue jo unke akhbaar news of da world kaa prakaashan band hone kaa kaaran bani, or pichley teen hafte se na keval britain balki duniyabar ke samachar madhyamon kii surkhiyon main chai hui he
 Because of this, the shareholders of their companies are feeling very uncomfortable
 haal main niyukt kiye jansampark salaahkaaron kii ranneeti ke mutabik rupert or james ne maafee maangi or afsos jataayaa; lekin unhone iske liye khud ko doshi nahin mana
 According to him, the sad truth is that the people he trusted — or his trusted people he trusted — betrayed and demeaned him
 yah vivaad ab samachar ikattha karne ke avaidh tareekon tak hi simit nahin rah gaya he
 With this being revealed, such suspicious and in some cases particularly hate-generating contact between the media, police and the government center has come up
 isaki vajah se landan ke do varisht police adhikariyon or murdoch kii vishwavyaapee news korporavshan kii british shakha news international ke do ati varisht akjicutive ko istipha dena padaa
 Due to this incident, Prime Minister David Cameron and his revenue minister George Osbourne have to face a lot of embarrassment
 camerun kii aalochana khaskar isliye ho rahi he kyonki unhone vipaksh ke netaa kii haisiyat se endi kolson ko apana chif hnnes officer niyukt kiya tha or pradhanmantri banane ke baad kathith taur par osborne ke suzav par unhen sarkaar kaa pramukh pravaktaa banaaya tha
 Colson resigned from the News of the World in 2007 after two newspaper-linked individuals were jailed in connection with the hacking of telephones by members of the Raj family
 kolson ne kaha tha ki unhen in aparaadhon kii koi jaankaree nahin thi or ise anjaam dene vaala mahaj ek ''badmaash samvaadadaata'' or ek takneekee visheshgy tha jise us samvaadadaata ne niyukt kiya tha
 Several people are said to have warned against taking Cameron with him to the Prime Minister's Office and his residence, 10 Downing Street
 un logon main da gargian ke sampadak or nik cleg shaamil hai, jo libral democratic party ke netaa or gathbandhan sarkaar main up pradhanmantri hai
 Cameron ignored his advice, as he believed that this appointment would strengthen his relations with the then all-powerful Murdoch Empire
 pradhanmantri ne apane bachaav main kaha ki unhone maasoomiyat ke ikraar par bharosa kar liya or unhen laga ki unhen ek or mauka diya janaa chahie
 But earlier this year, when evidence emerged that more than two people were jailed in the hacking case, Colson resigned from Downing Street
 ab unhen giraftaar kar liya gaya he or unke khilaaf aapraadhik aarope lagaae ja sakate hai
 The investigation has revealed that News International had a strong and apparently inappropriate relationship between reporters, executives and police
 hekking maamle kii 2007 main hui police jaanch ko isi vajah se aparyaapt mana ja rahaa he
 Cameron admitted in the House of Commons on July 20 that "after fully understanding the incident it seems that" made a mistake by appointing Colson
 pradhanmantri kii bagal main baithe osborne puri tarah sharmasaar dikh rahe the
 Cameron said, "somebody learns over time and believe me you have learned a lesson
" '' lekin jab tak adaalat main yah sabit nahin ho jayega ki kolson ne unase jhooth bolaa tab tak ve aupchaarik taur par maafee nahin maangenge
 He also announced the members of a committee to conduct a judicial inquiry into the relationship between media, government and police
 isamen teen varisht patrakaron ke alaava naagarik adhikaar sanghathan liberty ke haai-profile pramukh shami chakrabarti bhi shaamil hai
 London-born Chakraborty's parents are Bengali
 samiti kii 19 july kii baithak main rupert murdoch or donon partiyon ke varisht raajnneetikon ke bich kareebi rishte, or uski gopneey prakruti bhi kaaphi had tak ujagar hui
 Murdoch said that whenever he visited Downing Street, he was always asked to go in through the back door to avoid the gaze of photographers and reporters
 unhen pichley saal ke chunaav ke fouran baad vahaan chaay par bulaayaa gaya tha
 The new Prime Minister then thanked him for his newspapers' support during the election campaign
 is bayaan ke baad dabaav main aae camerun ne apane pradhanmantritvakaal main hnnes maalikon or sampadakon ke saath apni baithkon kaa sara byora prakashit kar diya he
 He met with the executive of News International at least 26 times but refused to say each time that the issues raised in those meetings also included Murdoch's controversial attempt to exert full control over Biskibee
 biskibi bahut kamau satellite broadcaster he, jisamen murdoch kaa hissaa kam he
 The government initially decided that the auction did not need to be handed over to regulatory authorities — but the decision was overturned as the current controversy arose
 ab yah nilaamee waapas le lee gai he; or jab 19 july kii sunwaayee ke dauraan is maamle ko uthaaya gaya to murdoch kaa yadakada dikhne vaala aakraamak ravaiya saamne aa gaya, jise unhone vinamratavash ab tak kisi tarah dabaae rakhaa tha
 "many people have different agendas to create a frenzy against us," he said
 hamaare pratispardhiyon ne hamen mushkil ghadi se vimukh hone kii sthiti main pakad liya or isaki vajah se hamaare liye aage badhanaa avyaavhaarik ho gaya
 "many people were surprised to see that 80-year-old Murdoch's gestures and work were beginning to affect his age
" ve puche gaye sawaalon ke ruk-rukkar jawaab de rahe the, praayah chote jawaab dete the or jawaab dene se pehle kaaphi der tek chuppi saadhe rahete the
 His performance has raised questions about whether he is fit to run a worldwide company that employs 53,000 people
 haalanki unhone kaha ki ve antat apni ek santan ko ''agar ve chahen to'' company kaa niyantran saunpna chaahate hai, lekin phone-hekking sankat se vah din jaldi hi aa saktaa he jab visheshkar america ke duusare saajheedaar murdoch parivaar ke baahar ke vyakti ko company kaa mukhiya bananaa chahenge
 Murdoch has rapidly lost the ability to enchant senior politicians
 ab ve unki baithak main shaamil hone kii bajaay unase duuri banaae rakhana pasand karenge
 While discussing his relations with the ministers, he once expressed regret, clearly said, "alas! They would have left me alone
 '' unki yah khwaahish kam se kam ek maamle main puri kar di jaaegi-unhen nikat bhavishya main downing street main aamantrit nahin kiya jayega, yahaan tak ki kaarobaariyon vaale dwaar ke jariye bhi nahin

 haal hi main teen rajyon kii siyaasi jang fatah karne ke baad pehali baar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi apane sansadeey kshetra ke do divasiy daure par shuukravaar ko amethi pahunch rahe hai
 Union minister Smriti Irani, who contested against him from Amethi, will also be in the same region
 2014 ke baad pehali baar donon diggaj ek hi din amethi main honge
 In such a situation, the political mercury of Amethi is likely to be hot due to the two leaders, but changes have been made in Rahul's program at the last moment
 rahul gandhi ke daur main achaanak badlaav kiya gaya he
 Rahul will now land at Fursatganj in Raeberli instead of Lucknow Amausi Airport, where the party leaders will welcome him
 iske baad rahul shuukravaar ko apane sansadeey kshetra ke gauriganj main abhivaktaaon ke kaarykram main shaamil honge
 Explain that changes have been made in Rahul's pre-decided programs due to the Parliament session
 rahul gandhi amethi ke apane do divasiy daure ke dauraan kai kaaryakramon main hissaa lenge
 He can surround the Modi government on the issue of demonetisation and Rafale, discussing his condition with farmers
 jabaki kendriya kapadaa mantri smriti irani bhi shuukravaar ko yahaan kambal vitaran kaarykram main shirkat karengi
 Raghavaram Seva Sansthan is doing this program in Amethi
 iske alaava vah amethi main ek awasaiya vidhyalay kii aadharshila rakhengi or siechasi gauriganj main siti scan mashin kaa udghaatan bhi karengi
 The activism of the BJP and the presence of Smriti Irani in Rahul Gandhi's stronghold Amethi have increased uneasiness in the Congress camp
 darasal amethi gandhi parivaar kii paramparaagat sansadeey seat maani jaati he
 bjp's Smriti Irani contested against Rahul in 2014
 haalanki wo jeet nahin saki thim, lekin unhone amethi se naata nahin todaa
 Smriti Irani was made a cabinet minister after Narendra Modi formed the government at the Center in 2014 and has been very active in Amethi since then
 maheene- do maheene par wo amethi aati rahati hai
 Smriti Irani also arrived here 15 days ago
 is dauraan unhone 77 karod kii yojanaon kii saugat di thi
 Apart from this, Smriti Irani sent saris as gifts to many women on the occasion of Diwali
 itnaa hi nahin bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath bhi amethi main jansabha kar chuke hai
 With Smriti Irani's activism in Amethi, Rahul Gandhi is constantly visiting Amethi
 aise main 4 janvari ko donon netaaon kii ek hi samay amethi main maujuudagi kaaphi dilachasp hogi
 It is believed that in such a situation, the two leaders can be subjected to verbal attacks on each other
 mana ja rahaa he ki smriti rahul ke durg se agasta ghotaale main misses gandhi ke aae naam ko mudda banaakar hamalaa kar sakati hai
 At the same time, the Congress is not in the mood to make any lapse before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections regarding Amethi
 congress amethi ke apane puraane netaaon ko party kaaryakartaaon ko sakriy karne main juty he taaki is baar jeet ke liye 2014 jaisaa sangharsh na karnaa pade

 On the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti in Lucknow, Mayawati said that Babasaheb gave legal rights to the neglected
 unhone kaha ki hamaari party ne sadaiv dabe-kuchlon kaa dhyaan rakhaa or kisi party ne aisa nahin kiya
