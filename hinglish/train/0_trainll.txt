 Even before meeting with US President Donald Trump, North Korea's ruler Kim Jong Un has been irritated by the US
 or naaraaz hokar usne 12 june ko singapore main hone vaali mulaakaat radd karne kii dhamkee bhi di he
 But the question is, why did Kim Jong Un end up? Why did he show old attitude? So the reason is that on one hand the US is putting pressure on Kim to stop his nuclear program and on the other side he is also doing military drill with South Korea
 aise main kim ko gussa to aana hi tha
 'max Thunder' enraged Kim Jong Un! On the one hand, Kim Jong expects him to destroy his nuclear site, for peace in the Korean Peninsula
 vahiin duusari taraf dakshin korea ke saath milakar trump kii sena military drill kar rahi he
 More than a hundred airplanes were used in this joint drill named Max Thunder
 jisamen america or dakshin korea ke darjanon fiter plane, bombar or transport aircraft ne apana johar dikhaaya
 But this Jauhar of America has brought Marshal Kim Jong Un of North Korea into the limelight
 marshall ne di meeting cancil karne kii dhamkee!to kya phir se tut jayega saalon baad hua yaarana
 Or there will be an attempt to aman in Korean peninsula
 or phir se uttar korea or dakshin ban jaaenge dushman
 These are the questions that are starting to arise again
 kyonki agar kim or trump kii 12 june ko hone vaali meeting cancil hoti he, to phir se jangi halaat ban jaaenge jo shaayad duniya ke liye acchhee khabar nahin hogi
 Annoyed with America, North Korea! The question is why Kim Jong, suddenly surprised by his diplomacy and sitting ready to stop his nuclear program, suddenly got angry
 to suniye kim ke gusse kii pehali vajah he wo military drill jo korian peninsula main america dakshin korea ke saath milakar kar rahaa he
 On the other hand, he is expecting Kim to initiate peace in the peninsula
 america kii is dohari ranneeti par kim kaa gussa jaays he
 The other reason for this anger is that before the meeting with Trump, North Korea has been upset by the increasing demands of the US
 military drill se naaraaz he kinhgar ye meeting tali to duniya se ek bade yuddh kaa jo khatra mitata najar aa rahaa tha
 He will start hovering again
 or ek baar phir sabakuch vaisaa hi najar aane lagegaa jaisaa uttar korea or dakshin korea kii mulaakaat se pehle tha
 Military drills from the US and South Korea have caused Kim to become so upset that he even canceled a May 16 conversation with South Korea
 aisa lag rahaa he ki uttar korea or dakshin korea ke bich panpi dosti ek baar phir se dushmani kaa chola odh sakati he
 Kim and Trump's meeting may be canceled; North America's dictator Kim Jong promised not to conduct nuclear tests could be broken at the behest of the US
 itnaa hi nahin trump or kim jong un ke bich bahupratikshit 12 june ko singapore main hone vaali mulaakaat bhi radd ho sakati he
 Indeed, one of the reasons for Kim's anger is the statement by US National Security Advisor John Bolton in which he mentioned the Libyan model for North Korea
 kim ke mantri ne diya ye bayanuttar korea kii sarkari media ne up videsh mantri kim ke-guan kaa bayaan jari kiya he
 In the statement, Guan said that if the US bypasses us and only demands unilaterally that we stop our nuclear program, then we are not in favor of such talks
 saath hi america or uttar korea ke bich hone vaali aagaamee baithak par bhi ham vichaar karenge
 Angry over comparing the Libyan model, the Libyan model mentioned by Bolton under former Libyan ruler Colonel Gaddafi carried out nuclear disarmament
 lekin libya ke parmaanu hathiyaaron ke nasht hone ke 1 saal baad hi gaddaphi kii hatya kar di gai thi
 The assassination was carried out by nato-backed Libyan rebels
 aise main jab uttar korea ke liye libya model kaa zikr hua to kim jong un kaa gussa saatven aasmaan par pahunch gaya
 The warm-up has become a ruckus The response of North Korea to the US and South Korea, just 3 days before it, has become a ruckus
 haalanki america ne abhi trump or kim kii mulaakaat kii sambhaavna ko khaarij nahin kiya he
 This attitude of North Korea is telling that even if Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump met on June 12, everything will not be according to the script of America

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday raised the Samajwadi Party's election campaign from Sultanpur
 akhilesh ne pehali chunavi sabha ke liye sultanpur ko hi kyon chunaa, ye sawaal har kisi kii jubaan par he
 Actually, the fifth phase in Sultanpur is to be voted on 27 February
 aise main mukhyamantri ne pehle charan yaa duusare charan ke chunaav vaale kshetron ko chhodkar sultanpur kaa rukh kyon kiya, is yaksha prashn ko lekar samaajawaadee party ke kaaryakarta bhi hairat main hai
 a theory is also being given that Akhilesh probably did not start campaigning from western Uttar Pradesh because he wanted the first phase nomination to be completed there
 saath hi gathbandhan main siton kii adla-badali ko lekar bhi sthiti puri tarah saaf ho jaae
 The theory behind Akhilesh's Sultanpur election campaign is being given
 is theory ke mutabik akhilesh vaastushastra ke hisaab se apni yatra tay kar rahe hai
 It is not clear whether Akhilesh is doing this at the behest of any astrologer
 haalanki varanasi main kaashi vishwanath mandir ke karypalak sadsy jyotishacharya rishi dvivedi kaa kahana he ki kyonki akhilesh yadav kanya lagn mithun raashi ke hai or mithun raashi se kumbh raashi bhagya sthaan he
 As a result, luck letter 'su' comes
 sultanpur isi se sambandhit he isse bhagyalabh hoga
 As far as Vastu is concerned, Sultanpur falls in the east direction from Saifai, the birthplace of Akhilesh Yadav
 sultanpur se aagaaj ke peeche ye vajah ho sakati he ki surya kaa tej or laabh zyada mili isliye surya ke udgam sthal ko chunaa gaya he
 The Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's talk is to fill the leaders with luck
 lekin chunaav koi bhi ummidavaar lard rahaa ho to wo yahi chahta he ki bhagya ke sitare yaa nakshatra puri tarah uskaa saath den
 Their effort for this is that nomination should be filled only after taking out auspicious time

 Do you remember nattha? The story of Peepli village of the film Peepli Live, the date of the suicide of which becomes news spectacle
 ek kisaan ne khudakushi kii thaanee to system hill gaya
 In 2010, Aamir Khan took inspiration from the village where he made the film Peepli Live and the character that influenced Natha's character Aaj Tak's team reached the same village
 chunavi rajya madhya pradesh kii rajdhani bhopal se lagbhag 200 kilometre dur baitool jile ke paas ek chota sa gaanv he sesra, jahaan rahete hai pipli live ke nattha urf kunjee laal malviya
 In the year 2003, Key Lal Malaviya had predicted his death and sat in a small temple just opposite his house in Sehra village
 ilaake main pehali baar kisi insaan ke marane kii bhavishyavaanee kii khabar jangal main aag kii tarah faili or media prashasan sahit sarkaar kaa deraa is gaanv main mela lekar baith gaya
 Key Lal Malaviya is now 90 years old
 umr sharir par haaavee ho chuki he isliye sharir zyada chal phir nahin paata
 When we remember something, we tell stories about how he predicted his death
 kunjeelal bataate hai ki unke purakhe unke pita or unhen kundali padhane aati he or 75 saal kii umr main unhone apane marane kaa andeshaa hua lekin baat ek patrkaar ke jariye li ho gai or hangaamaa ho gaya

 sehara gaanv ke nivasee ram lakhan aaj bhi us ghatana ko yaad karte hai or bataate hai, "us samay gaanv main shahari chahal-pahal bhar gai thi
 People climbed on the mud roofs surrounding Key Lal's house
 "kunjee laal ke gaanv main ab bahut kuch badal gaya he
 Paved roads have been built in the village, schools have been built, Anganwadi centers have also been made and primary health has also been arranged

 Dada Keylal is not at all angry with maternal uncle Shivraj
 ve kehete hai, "pehle ke mukaable unke gaanv or puure baitool kii tasviir ab badal gai he
 Shivraj ruled for 15 years but did a good job
 "lekin asli jindagi ke nattha ke is gaanv main unki umr ke kai aise log bhi hai jo shivaraj sarkaar se khaasaa naaraaz hai
 Parshuram, a 78-year-old grandfather sitting in a panchayat of elders near the tree, says, "this time everyone is coming and saying that the electricity bill will be forgiven, debt will be forgiven, everyone will be forgiven, will give so much water that the house will be drowned
 saalon se aisa sunate hue aa rahe hai lekin aisa hua kuch bhi nahin na karja maaf hua naa pani mila
 Did say the same thing last time but did nothing
 har baar aashwaasan dete hai lekin karte kuch nahin karte
 He is from 15 years but did nothing to them
 "gaanv ke logon kii shikaayat he ki pichhali baar vot maangane jo netaa ji aae vah matdaan hone ke baad dobaaraa kabhi dikhaai bhi nahin pade
 Anuj, a resident of the same village, says, "no one has seen anyone in the village since the next day after the vote was given to Netaji, never came back and did not appear in this village till date
 ab to roj roj dikhaai pad rahe hai
 Go to his house to get his work done, even if he stays at home, he says that Delhi is roaming, Bhopal is roaming, America is roaming
 vot padane ke baad kabhi dikhaai nahin padate
 "farmer Ramkishore of the same village says that the crop, which is not sold at the cost of selling the same result, the family is unable to eat the bread of June 2 happily and life simply runs in losses
 ramkishor kehete hai ki 3 saal se kheti main jitna lagaaya uski laagat bhi nahin nikal paa rahi he isliye bank se karja lete hai or mazdooree karke chukaate hai
 There is also a lot of resentment among the youth of the village and unemployment is the biggest issue facing them
 biessi kar rahe deepak or bisie kar rahe santosh kaa kahana he ki unhen abhi se apane bhavishya ko lekar chintaa ho rahi he
 Santosh and Deepak say that barely 10% of the youth of the village could get employment and in such a situation they are worried about whether they will have any work or not
 in donon yuvaaon kaa maananaa he ki shivaraj kii sarkaar ne rojgaar par dhyaan nahin diya or isliye is chunaav main yah donon yuva badlaav kii baat kar rahe hai
 Apart from unemployment, the biggest problem of Sehra village is lack of drinking water
 sehara gaanv kii aakhri kone par mahilaon kii lambii qatari, sadak par rakhen plastic ke dibbe or gagariyaan or saath hi tubewel kii pipe se bahata pani shivaraj sarkaar ke vikaas ke daavon kii puri kalai khol rahaa he
 The children who should be in school, they are seen carrying a pot full of water on their head to quench thirst
 badahaali itani ki pani bhi roj mayssar nahin he
 The women say that they leave the work site and come to the same tubewell pipe to fight with each other fighting fights, which is not happening every day
 pani ek din aata he to agle din nahin aise main jiske hisse jitna mil jaae vah kismat vaala
 Talking to Aaj Tak, Lakshmi said, "this tubewell also runs till february-march and drinking water is not available even in the cold
 bacchon ko bhi madad ke liye aana padataa he or kai baar line itani zyada hoti he ki auraten aapas main hi jhagad padati hai
 Every time we go to the elections by promising that we will give drinking water but nothing has changed here for years
 "aisa nahin he ki baitool ke ek chote se gaanv main kuch nahin hua he
 Many basic facilities have reached the village, but drinking water and employment for two rotis is still the biggest problem for which this village struggles every day
 yahi sangharsh ab unhenchunavi vaayademen har baar kii tarah puraa karne kaa laalach detaa he lekin system kii berukhi yah gaanv waakif he

 Criticizing Republican leaders who talk of isolating American Muslims, US President Barack Obama has said that the minority community has always been a part of America
 obama ne kaha ki is samudaay ko sabase zyada dar is baat kaa he ki unhen kahin kuch aise logon ke hinsak krityon ke liye dosha na diya jaae, jo unke dharm kaa pratinidhitiv bhi nahin karte
 Obama said at an Eid ceremony held at the White House on Thursday, "like all Americans, you are concerned with the threat of terrorism
 
 
 lekin isse bhi upar aapako ek dar he ki kuch aise logon ke hinsak krityon ke liye aapke puure samudaay ko dosha diya jayega, jo aapke dharm kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karte
 
 
 Criticizing Republican leaders seeking to ban Muslim entry, increase surveillance, and even introduce people on racial grounds, Obama said, "isolating Muslim Americans nurtures isil's same lies" To do, which says that the West is at war with a religion that has more than one billion followers
 
 
 yah acchhee rashtriya suraksha nahin he
 
 
 "obama said," Actually organizations like ISIS and Al Qaeda are at war with Muslim communities, even in the holy month (ramadan)
 
 
 " Obama said, "and discriminating against Muslim Americans is also an insult to the values that make our country great
 
 
 '' unhone kaha, ''muslim america utane hi deshbhakt, eemaandaar or america hai, jitna ki america parivaar kaa koi anya sadsy he
 
 
 And then whether your family has lived here for many generations or you have come here new, you are an important part of the fabric of our country
 
 
 '' obama ne kaha ki muslim americanyon ko ghrinaa ko nakaarna hi hoga
 The comments unhone kaha, ''muslim americanyon - or sabhi americanyon - ko bhedbhaav ko nakaarna hoga
 
 
 Muslim Americans - and all Americans - must respond to all those who incite hatred or say that their interpretation of their religion justifies violence
 
 
 '' unhone kaha, ''ham chaahe isai hon yaa yahudee, hindu hon yaa muslim, yaa phir ham kisi bhi dharm ke kyon na hon, ye jimmedaariyaan ham sabhi par hai
 
 
 "the US President said that we have to reaffirm that in this country we have a responsibility to follow the law, take care of each other, be part of a community
" 
 
 ham apane matbhedon kaa sammaan kar saken or apni pahchaan ke liye zaruri chizon ko barkaraar rakh saken or phir bhi is desh main hamaari patibaddhta or yakeen majbootee ke saath jataa saken
 Obama said that the celebration of Eid in the White House is another proof that Muslims have always been a part of America
 obama ne guuruuvaar ko white house main yojit ek id samaaroh main kaha, "sabhi americanyon kii tarah, aap aatankwaad ke khatre se chintit hai
 
 
 But above all, you have a fear that your entire community will be blamed for the violent acts of some people who do not represent your religion
 
 
 " muslimon ke pravesh par pratibandh laga dene, nigaraanee badhaane or yahaan tak ki nasli aadhaar par logon kaa parichay nirdhaaran kii maang karne vaale republican netaaon kii aalochana karte hue obama ne kaha, "muslim americanyon ko alag-thalag karnaa iesael ke usee jhooth ko poshit karnaa he, jo kahata he ki pashchim ek aise dharm ke saath yuddhrat he, jiske ek arab se zyada anuyaayi hai

 After Mahatma Gandhi, the one person who has been the most competitive among the parties to occupy the political legacy in independent India is the architect of the Constitution Baba Saheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar
 desh aaj unki 126veen jayanti manaa rahaa he
 It has been more than 60 years since the death of Baba Saheb, but even today, from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in the Center and most states of the country to the oldest parties like Congress and regional parties like BSP, RPI, even more than the ideology of Babasaheb himself There is a competition to be told more closely
 14 april 1891 ko madhyapradesh ke ek dalit parivaar main janme baba sahib ne asaadhaaran pratibha ke hone ke baavjood jindagi bhar asprishyata kaa dansh jhela
 It started from his childhood when he started going to school and in 1923 when he returned to India after taking higher education from abroad, there was not much change in the situation
 tabhi se baba sahib ne daliton ko barabari kaa haq dilaane ko apane jivan kaa ekmaatr lakshya bana liya
 He wrote many books and attacked the evils of Hinduism
 is dauraan kuch aisi ghatnaayen bhi ghatin jiske chalate unhen oonchi jatiyon kaa tagada virodh jhelana padaa
 Mahad Satyagraha The Mahad Satyagraha started by him in 1927 was a notable event in this direction
 darasal us samay daliton ko oonchi jatiyon ke liye tay talab or kunon se pani nahin lene diya jaataa tha
 In August 1923, the Bombay Legislative Council passed a resolution that all government ponds could be used by everyone
 mahad bhi bombai kaaryakshetra kaa hissaa tha lekin oonchi jatiyon ke hinduon ke virodh ke kaaran ise amal main nahin laayaa ja sakaa
 Babasaheb decided to challenge it and took thousands of Dalits along with him on 20 March 1927 to drink water from Mahad's public Chavadar pond
 20 march ko aaj bhi us ghatana kii yaad main saamaajik shashaktikaran diwas banaaya jaataa he
 Entry into the Kalaram Temple Like public ponds, the entry of Dalits in the temples at that time was strictly prohibited
 ambedkar kaa tark tha ki yadi bhagwaan sabake hai to uske mandir main sirf oonchi jatiyon ke log hi kyon ja sakate hai
 On 2 March 1930, a historic protest was held outside the famous Kalaram temple in Nashik under the leadership of Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar, which resulted in Dalits being allowed to enter the temple
 bharat main dalit andolan main ye ghatana ek mile kaa pathar sabit hui
 i am born a Hindu, but the Hindus will not die Ambedkar, with the strength with which the Dalits were engaged in uniting them and empowering them politically-socially, with the same strength, their opponents also insisted to stop them
 Was applying lambey sangharsh ke baad jab ambedkar ko bharosa ho gaya ki ve hindu dharm se jatipratha or asprishyata kii kureetiyaan dur nahin kar paa rahe to unhone wo aitihaasik vaktavy diya jisamen unhone kaha ki main hindu paidaa to hua hum, lekin hindu maruunga nahin
 Opposition on Hindu code bill After independence, Dr
 Ambedkar became law minister in Pandit Nehru's cabinet and on Nehru's initiative he prepared Hindu code bill but he also had to face strong opposition to this bill
 khud nehru bhi tab apni party ke andar or baahar is mudde par badhate dabaav ke saamne jhukate najar aae
 Differences on the issue increased so much that Ambedkar resigned from the post of Law Minister
 haalanki baad main hindu code bill paas hua or usase hindu mahilaon kii sthiti main krantikari badlaav bhi aayaa lekin ambedkar ke bill se ye kai maamalon main lacheela tha
 Baba Saheb was attracted to Buddhism in the early 1950s and went to Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) to attend a Buddhist conference
 14 oktober 1956 ko nagpur main unhone apane lakhon samarthakon ke saath buddha dharm grahan kiya
 From the 22 pledges he took on this occasion, he completely abandoned Hinduism and its method of worship
 doctor ambedkar ke saath takreeban 10 lakh daliton ne tab buddha dharm apanaaya or ye puri duniya main dharm parivartan kii sabase badi ghatana thi
 However, he himself described it as not a change of religion, but a liberation from religion-borne physical, mental and economic slavery
 buddha dharm kii diksha lene ke liye 22 pratigyaaen:-1
 i will never consider Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh as gods nor will i worship them
 2
 i will never consider Rama and Krishna to be God, nor will i worship them
 3
 i will not accept nor worship any goddess of Hinduism like Gauri, Ganapati etc
 4
 i do not believe God has ever incarnated
 5
 i would never assume that the Tathagata Buddhists are incarnations of Vishnu

 In Haryana, there have been many cases of fraud in the subsidy given by the government
 ek report main bataaya gaya he ki jin logon kii maut barason pehle ho chuki he, unke naam par bhi kisi or ko sabsidi kaa laabh de diya gaya
 This report has been published by EI Express
 pradesh ke dhaana ganva ke kisaan hatti va ibrahim kii maut 2001 main hi ho chuki he
 Farmer Harmat of this village died in the year 2006
 iske baavjood haryana ke horticulture vibhaag main inaki ore se sabsidi paane ke liye na keval arji di gai, balki inhen sabsidi bhi de di gai
 Subsidy is given under the National Mission for Small Scale Irrigation (NMMI)
 isi gaanv ke kisaan va ibrahim ke bete javed ne kaha ki jab ve 2013 main jila bagwani vibhaag ke daftar main sabsidi ke liye aavedan karne gaye, to unhen bataaya gaya ki unke pita ke naam par saal 2011 main sabsidi di ja chuki he
 Javed said that his father died in 2001 at the age of 75
 duusari ore, vibhaag kaa daawa he ki unke pita ne 1
 48 lakhs as subsidy
 vibhaag ke record ke mutabik, hatti ne bhi saal 2011 main sabsidi ke liye daawa kiya tha, jabaki unke bhattije ali mohammad kaa kahana he ki unki maut bahut pehle hi ho chuki he
 Ali said that the officials of the department say that since they have already received the subsidy, according to the rule, they cannot claim such subsidy for the next 5 years
 yah ilaaka punahana tehsil main aata he, jo ki dilli ke dakshin main kareeb 100 kilometre kii duuri par he
 The area is counted in the most backward areas of Haryana
 report ke mutabik, NMMI skim ke tahat 80 se zyada aise maamle saamne aae hai, jab kisi mritak ke naam par sabsidi kaa vaara-nyaara kar diya gaya
 Names to which subsidies were given in a fake way, he never applied for subsidy in the last 2 years
 zyaadaatar maamalon main is tarah kii sabsidi farji voter card ke jariye di gai, jis par pataa uskaa darj tha, jisane naam par sabsidi lee gai
 The NMMI scheme was known as the Micro Irrigation Scheme (MIS) before 2010
 iskaa makasad chote paimaane par sinchai kii takanic ko badhaava dena tha
 The aim was also that water should be used better in agriculture, fertilizer and power needs should be minimized, as well as increase in yield
 is skim main 40 fisadi kharch centre sarkaar, jabaki 10 fisadi kharch rajya sarkaar uthaati he
 The remaining 50 per cent is loaned to the farmer at easy rates

 Raw mango, gooseberry, carrot pickles contain plenty of vitamins, calcium, iron, potassium and many nutrients
 jo pregnent mahila kii immunity ko majboot karne main uski madad karte hai
 Good bacteria are present in the digestive process, which helps in increasing the good bacteria by reaching the intestines of pregnant women

 apni kaaryakarini ke rasukhdaar sadsy maulavee or shikshak moulana salmaan nadvi ko ol india muslim personal lau board (eiempielbi) ne barkhaast kar diya
 He was accused of meeting the Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar for possible settlement out of the Ayodhya dispute court, at a time when the dispute is currently being heard in the Supreme Court
 board ne jor dekar kaha ki nadvi ravishankar se milane ke liye adhikrut nahin the
 Executive members Kamal Farooqui and Zafaryab Jilani said that Nadvi has "hurt Muslim interests by taking a different approach from the board's opinion"
 vah jagah musasmaanon kii he or babari masjid kii jagah bani rahegi
 "annoyed Nadvi said that he himself left it before he was removed from the board
 lakhanu ke daarul ulum nadwatul ulema madrase ke chaatro ke aage ve foot-footkar ro pade
 He said, "I was trying to bring peace
" mere saath jo log ninsaphi kar rahe hai, allaah taaala unase nibatega
 "but he was more aggressive when talking to reporters
 unhone kaha, ''board ko charampanthiyon ne hijac kar liya he
 It is dictatorial
 aapasi rajamandi se mudde kaa nibatara karne or is tarah adaalat kaa faisla aane par dange-fasaad ke halaat se bachane main galat kya he?" nadvi ke mutabik, baatcheet se maamle kaa samaadhaan ''teen maheenon ke bheetar khoja" ja saktaa he
 His dismissal (or his exit from the board) was largely seen as a setback to Ravi Shankar's mediation expectations
 magar kuch vishleshak yah bhi kah rahe hai ki unhone board ke bheetar kii foot ko ujagar kar diya he
 Sri Sri had entrusted his envoy to Gautam Vig to negotiate with members of the board who may be in favor of the settlement outside the court
 wig kehete hai, ''gurudev ko lagata he ki adaalat kaa faisla dilon ko ek saath nahin laa saktaa
 The losing side will feel hurt
 " nadvi ke samarthak or sevanivrutt iees afasar anis ansaari us pratinidhimandal main shaamil the, jo 8 farvari ko bangaluru main ravishankar se mila tha
 Ansari claims that "the court's verdict will result in bloodshed as both Hindus and Muslims have a strong feeling that this land belongs to them
" jyon hi vahaan rakhi murtiyon ko hataane kii yaa duusari taraf, us sthal par mandir banane kii jaraa bhi koshish hoti he, to khoonkhraba hoga
 Therefore the best route is an agreement that is honorable for both sides
 "bahut zyada samjhautavaadi or jarurat se zyada naram rukh akhriyaar karata dikhne kii chintaa se grast ansaari ne kaha ki unhone nadvi kii taraf se daleel di ki baatcheet ke jariye kisi bhi samjhaute kii disha main tabhi badha ja saktaa he jab hindu abhiyojan paksh yah sweekaar kare ki jameen par malikana haq to musalamaanon kaa hi he
 Apart from this, there should be some guarantee of the legislative kind that there will be no such tampering of the other prayers of Muslims
 duusari ibaadatgahon se unka ishaara shaayad kaashi or mathura ke vivaadit sthalon se he
 Apart from this, Ansari said that those responsible for martyrdom of Babri Masjid should be punished illegally
 " wig ke mutabik, ravishankar ne is baat par jor diya ki yah charchaa zyada asardaar hogi agar hindu or muslim, donon paksh vivaadit sthal par ram mandir nirmaan or masjid kaa nirmaan kisi duusari jagah par karaane par raji ho jate hai
 Ravi Shankar claims that when he started contacting the board members to resolve the dispute through negotiations, about one-third of the 51-member board seemed to agree with him
 hyderabad se loksabhaa saansad asaduddin ovaisi ne nadvi par hamalavar hote hue un par ''pradhanmantri modi ke ishaaron par naachne" kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Owaisi called for a boycott of people who cited an old edict signed by Nadvi, stating that "a mosque remains a mosque till the mosque remains"
 should be done
 haalanki nadvi ne ravishankar ko bataaya tha ki sunni musalamaanon kii chaar pramukh vichaardhaaraon main se ek hambali vichaardhaara kisi masjid ko ek jagah se hataakar duusari jagah par le jaae jane kii ijaajat detii he
 In this sense, the Babri Masjid can be rebuilt at some other place away from the disputed site
 ravishankar ke anusaar, ''bharat ke har kone se kai musalmaan netaa mujhase mili or vivaadit sthal par mandir nirmaan tathaa kuch duuri par masjid nirmaan ke liye donon pakshon main samjhauta karaane kii disha main mere prayaason kaa samarthan kiya
 "the Shia Waqf Board of Uttar Pradesh openly supported Ravi Shankar
 haalanki sunni pakshakaar kah rahe hai ki maamla adaalat main he or rahi baat shiyaon kii to unka is vivaad par apana najariya rakhane kaa koi haq hi nahin banataa
 However, Zafar Farooqui, chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Waqf Board, which owns the disputed land, was also involved in Ravi Shankar's meeting with Maulana Nadvi
 vaise, maahaul banataa hua dikhne laga he
 Ravi Shankar will soon visit Ayodhya once again and, like November, will once again start a new round of negotiations with Hindu and Muslim parties on the matter
 muslim personal lau board ke sadasyon ke saath unka sampark ab pehle se zyada hone kii ummid he
 The BJP and the Sangh Parivar are not getting involved in this process of negotiation, rather they are keeping a close watch from outside
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa or is maamle ke yachikakarta subrahmanyam swami ko is vaarta kii safalataa par andeh he
 However, they claim that they have also made a failed attempt to establish mutual consent in the past
 unhen nahin lagata ki musalmaan vivaadit sthal par mandir banaae jane ke liye raji honge kyonki unhen dar he ki ve isse kattarpathiyon ke nishane par aa jaaenge
 Swami says Ravi Shankar's "initiative" is welcome
 lekin sabase sahi tarika hoga ki adaalat se ek spasht nirnay praapt kiya jaae
 On the basis of the evidence that i have, i am confident that the court will decide in favor of the temple being built at the disputed site
 "is par pradhanmantri kaa najariya ab tak spasht nahin ho paaya he
 He has kept shrewd silence
 lekin ravishankar kii safalataa kaa rajnatik laabh to milegaa hi
 Modi has long aspired to be considered a leader of both Hindus and Muslims
 vaise, is vakt to ravishankar kii kamyaabi khayali pilav hi maani ja rahi he
 However, if Ravishankar's efforts allow the construction of a temple at the disputed site and the construction of a mosque at some other place, then Modi will be more pleased because the decision that will come from the court, it is less likely that he will Will be able to make the side very happy

 Expressing regret over not having a single Indian institute in the list of top 200 universities of the world, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that Indian educational institutions failed to make a move with rapid changes
 tippaniyan The Prime Minister emphasized that there is a need to bring flexibility in these institutions so that good teachers can be attracted towards them and the teaching level is high as higher education institutions are often criticized for being both teachers and students
 Is unnecessarily strict

 Many of them have not adapted themselves to the rapid changes that have taken place around us in the recent year, they are simply producing graduates who have no need in the job market

 Patients being treated at Shalimar Bagh's Camax Hospital say that after the closure of this hospital, they have less choice of good hospitals
 darasal, marijon kaa daawa he ki us kshetra main maujuud sarkari aspataalon main acha ilaaj nahin mil paata
 In such a situation, he had only one option left, where he could get his treatment

 First of all our team reached Rohini's Doctor Ambedkar Hospital

 Thousands of people come here daily for treatment
 ajtak kii team ne yahaan ilaaj kara rahe marijon se yah jaanane kii koshish kii ki wo is aspataal ke bare main kya sochate hai
 People said that we are very happy with the treatment of the government hospital
 mayank kaa kahana tha ki uski patni kaa ilaaj yaheen chal rahaa he
 This is the delivery of his wife
 magar unhen koi dikkat nahin hui
 When we asked what would be the problem if maxmax was untouched, then on this question, they said that if maxmax is untouched, they will not have any problem and they do not mind
 sarkari aspataalon main dawaaen samay par milti hai or aaj kal saaf safai kaa bhi khaas khyaal rakhaa ja rahaa he
 Doctor's behavior is also very good
 nijee aspataal main to lut machi hui he
 Direct operation is done on the slightest problem
 agar maiks band hota he to hamen to koi fark nahin padataa
 People from Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Mangolpuri also happy after this, our team reached Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Mangolpuri
 yah bhi ek bada sarkari aspataal he, jahaan rojaanaa hi hajaaron marij ilaaj ke liye aate hai
 Aaj Tak's team also spoke to the patients here

 There is no expenditure on treatment nor more on medicines
 nijee aspataalon kaa kharch uthaanaa aam logon ke bas kii baat nahin he
 If Max becomes hospitalized, we don't care about it nor do we have any problem with this
 apni puri jindagi sanjay gandhi aspataal se ilaaj karaane vaali ek vruddh mahila ne kaha ki maine taumr isi aspataal se ilaaj karaayaa
 Had he been treated in a private hospital, the house might have been sold

 Both had different views on AI

 The debate over AI also continued because the great scientist Stephen Hawking had once warned that it would one day eventually end humanity

 Humans have created computers, but i have never seen any computer made by humans
 iske aage i-commers diggaj ne apane liye kaha ki 'em note e tech gaay' (meri technology ko lekar jaankaree kam he)
 It seems to me that AI can help humans understand better
 mujhe nahin lagata ki ye insaanon ke liye koi khatra he
 On the other hand, Elon Musk stated his views and said that the speed with which computers are getting advanced is surprising
 aisi kalpana karen ki super-fast artficial intellegent divises kisi din dhime or sust insaan se cordinate karte-karte thak jaaen
 If nothing else happens, the computer will become a batch
 ye pedon se baat karne jaisaa hoga
 Musk further said that the expectations of humans are fine in that both go far along using computing power
 musk ne iske aage kaha ki philhal siborg kii tarah hi hai
 We are much better integrated with our phones and computers
 phone aapke ekstansion kii tarah he
 If you forget your phone, you will feel like leaving a part of you
 vahiin jaik maa ne aage kaha ki AI ke hone se insaanon ko zyada aaraam milegaa
 Because AI will do things like transport, fiddling and thinking about the people of the earth
 unhone aage kaha ki technology ke aage badhane se logon ko ek hafte main keval teen dinon tak hi or keval chaar ghanton tak hi kaam karne kii jarurat hogi
 Similarly the debate continued in both
 lekin donon ne ek baat par sahamati jataai ki ki maanav mrityu ek acchhee baat he, kyonki har janareshan hamaare saamne aane vaali vaishvik chunautiyon ke liye nae vichaar laati he

 US President Barack Obama is currently in India

 But meanwhile, China has warned India
 china kii sarkari media ne kaha he ki america kii ‘asia kii dhuree’ ranneeti mukhya rup se china ke ubhaar ko thaamne ke liye taiyaar kii gai he
 In such a situation, India and China should not fall into the competition trap by supporting it
 china ke sarkari akhbaar 'global times' ne apni tippanee ne kaha, ‘pashchimi media kii anek reporton main ingit kiya gaya he ki aitihaasik jatiltaaon se italmerica bharat ko saajhedaarke rup main, yahaan tak ki sahyogi ke rup main washington kii ‘asia kii dhuree’ ranneeti kii himaayat karne ke liye lubhaane ke makasad se zyada prayaas kar rahaa he
 It is primarily designed to halt the rise of China
 ’ tippanee main kaha gaya he ki bharat kii ‘pramukh shakti banane kii aakanksha’ he or use america nivesh, praudyogiki or raajnneetik samarthan kii jarurat he taaki uski ‘luk east’ videsh niti ‘china ke badhate prabhaav ko prati-santulit’ karne main behatar dhang se kaam karegi
 The Chinese newspaper said that the West created a certain kind of thinking and is being exaggerated, which inherently considers Chinese dragons and Indian elephants as inherently hostile
 tippanee main aage kaha gaya he, ‘pashchim ke majboot prachaar abhiyaan ke tahat yah siddhant bhartiya or chini donon janamat main upree taur par ek vaastavik ghatana ban gai he, haalanki yah china se zyada bharat main lokapriy he
 The 'daily warns that the West' is instigating India to be fully prepared for the threats posed by its larger neighbor and an attempt is being made to lay a trap
 ’tippanee main hidaayat di gai he ki china or bharat vishisht muddon par bahes roke or yah dimag main rakhe ki unke rishte jeene-marane kaa rup nahin le sakate
 The article states that the common interests between India and China are much larger than the disputes between them
 akhbaar ne likhaa he, ‘chunki donon ubhartee takatein hai, jinamein antarrashtriya samudaay main ahm takatein banane kii vishaal kshamta he, china or bharat ko hode kii bajaay sahyog main zyada sambhaavnaaen dekhni chahie
 This agreement is fundamental to bilateral relations
 ’ tippanee main kaha gaya he ki china or bharat ‘ham jite, tum haare’ (jiro-sam game) nahin chaahate, lekin pashchimi prabhaav main bharat udhar phisal rahaa he
 The official daily said that although there is still disagreement between the two sides on some specific issues, both China and India must agree on the most basic and important issue of connectivity and ensure that a larger perspective remains

 kareeb 40 logon kii maut kii khabar to pehle hi aa chuki thi, lekin ab yah bhi khabar he ki amarelli ke jangalon main saikadon pashu-pakshiyon kii bhi baadh main maut ho gai he
 The most shocking news has come about the lions
 ab tak aath sheron kii maut kii khabar ai he
 The news of the death of the lions has worried those who are dealing with wild life, ordinary citizens are also worried about the news of the death of the lions
 aakhir babbar sher puri duniya main sirf gujarat ke is ilaake main hi to paae jate hai
 Over the years, as the colony of lions grew, so did their expansion
 gir ke jangalon ke alaava amarelli zile main sabase zyada sher rahete hai
 According to the calculation of the last lions, about 176 lions live in the forests of Krakach and Lilia area of amreli
 is baar jab baadh ai to shethrunji nadi kaa pani is ilaake main bhi fail gaya
 Now the water has landed, people have seen the bodies of lions in many places
 amarelli ke kracch or lilia ilaake ke sher premiyon kaa kahana he ki unhone pehle hi van vibhaag ko chetaya tha ki monsoon kii dastak se pehle hi in sheron ko shethrunji nadi ke maidani ilaakon se hataakar pahari ilaakon main le jaaya janaa chahie, taaki baari barish kii sthiti main inaki jaan ko koi khatra na ho
 They are protected animals and are not only a country, but they are precious heritage for the whole world
 inhen bachaane ko sabase zyada praathamikta di jaani chahie
 He alleges that the Forest Department took his warning lightly, the result of which is that so many bodies have died so far
 abhi ye sankhya badhane kii bhi ashanka he
 The comments duusari ore van vibhaag kaa kahana he ki monsoon ke pehle hi kai sheron ko samvedansheel ilaakon se hataakar surakshit sthanon par le jaaya gaya tha
 The forest department says that even then the deaths of so many lions are a matter of concern and more lions are still being sought by local people and they will be taken to safer places if needed
 sabhi ko lagata he ki jaise sheron kii ginati main aadhunik technology kaa sahaara liya jaataa he, thik usee tarah prakritik aapadaa ke vakt bhi unhen bachaane ke liye bhi aadhunik technology kaa prayog kiya janaa chahie, taaki is bahumoolya dharohar ko samay rahete bachaaya ja sake

 This time when the flood occurred, the water of the Shetrunji river also spread in this area
 ab pani utraa he to logon ko kai jagahon par sheron ke shav dikhaai die hai
 The lion lovers of Krakach and Lilia region of Amreli say that they had already warned the forest department that these lions should be removed from the plains of the Shetrunji river to the hilly areas before the monsoon knocks There is no danger to their life in this situation
 ye sangrakshit jaanavar hai or sirf desh hi nahin, balki puri duniya ke liye ye anmol dharohar hai
 Saving them should be given the highest priority
 unka aarope he ki van vibhaag ne unki chetavanee ko halke main liya, jiskaa nateeja ye he ki itane sharon kii ab tak maut ho chuki he
 Now this number is also expected to increase
 tippaniyan On the other hand, the Forest Department says that many lions were removed from sensitive areas to safe places before the monsoon
 van vibhaag kaa kahana he ki phir bhi itane sheron kii maut chintaa kii baat he or sthaneey logon se milakar abhi or sheron kii talash kii ja rahi he or jarurat padane par unhen surakshit sthanon par le jaaya jayega
 Everyone feels that just as modern technology is used in the counting of lions, in the same way modern technology should be used to protect them even during natural calamities, so that this valuable heritage can be saved in time
 amarelli ke kracch or lilia ilaake ke sher premiyon kaa kahana he ki unhone pehle hi van vibhaag ko chetaya tha ki monsoon kii dastak se pehle hi in sheron ko shethrunji nadi ke maidani ilaakon se hataakar pahari ilaakon main le jaaya janaa chahie, taaki baari barish kii sthiti main inaki jaan ko koi khatra na ho

 The special significance of Goddess worship during Navratri is stated
 mata ke bhakt puure nau dinon tak maa kii aradhana karke unhen prasann karne kii koshish karte hai
 According to Hinduism, the three Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh together created Adishakti
 apni aathon bhujaaon main shastr or chehre par muskaan liye maa singh par virajman rahati hai
 Mother Durga, who destroyed a monster like Mahishasura, has even helped the gods in difficult times
 aise main is navaratri aaie jaanate hai har mahila ko maa adishkti se wo koun si 5 baaten hai jo jarur seekhni chahie
 Set a goal: The first thing i see when i see Durga's face is her smile
 jivan ke kisi bhi kathin mode par har stri ko cheher par aisi hi muskaan banaakar apni har pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa chahie
 The mother's big eyes tell that every woman should be conscious of her goal
 aapako apane jivan main kab or kahaan pahunchnaa hai is baat kaa pataa aapako rahanaa chahie
 There are nine forms of women during which many nine forms of mother are worshiped
 thik usee prakaar har mahila bhi apane jivan main kai kirdaar nibhaati he
 She sometimes fulfills all her responsibilities as daughter, mother, wife or sometimes grandmother and grandmother
 maa ke nau swaroop har mahila ko sandesh dete hai ki samay padane par matruv samete hue mahila khud kii or apane parivaar kii raksha karne ke liye chandi kaa avatar le sakati he
 According to Hinduism, Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh created the Goddess Durga with the help of their power to save the world
 maa durga kii is baat se aap yah sikh le sakate hai ki ek acha leader vahi hota he jo jindagibhar seekhney main vishwaas rakhata he
 Keep your vision of life big and clear
 aap jivan main kabhi bhi maat nahin khaaenge
 It is necessary to remain fearless in life
 Every woman should remain fearless and strong at the most difficult stage in life
 maa durga ke astitv se har mahila ko apni shaktiyon ko pahchaanane ke saath nirbhay rahane kii bhi sikh leni chahie
 Devi Shakti, riding on the lion, gives a message to every woman that if a woman is determined, she can also find a solution to the biggest problem
 bas aapako khud par vishwaas rakhane kii jarurat he
 multi-talented Bane Devi Durga's eight hands indicate every woman to become multi-talented
 agar aap apane jivan main kuch bada paanaa chaahate hai to aapako ek se zyada kaam karne aane chahie
 Doing this will not only save your time but will also develop your mind
 agar aap multi talented hongi to aapako jivan main safal hone se koi nahin roak saktaa

 Obviously, the price of vegetables can increase further
 kehete hai, puja karte vakt ghanti jarur bajaani chahie
 It is believed that God awakens and hears your prayers
 lekin ham aapako yahaan bataa rahe hai ki ghanti bajaane kaa sirf bhagwaan se hi conection nahin he, balki iskaa scientific asar bhi hota he
 This is the reason why the bell is always set at the entrance of the temple
 nahin mil rahi manachaahi naukari, to raashi anusaar karen ye upyghanti bajaane ke peeche kaa vaigyanik kaaranmandir ghar kaa ho yaa kisi dharmik sthal kaa
 There is a bell there
 iske peeche dharmik kaaran to hai hi saath main iskaa hamaare jivan par scientific asar bhi hota he
 Scientists say that when the bell is rung, a vibration occurs in the atmosphere, which goes far due to the atmosphere
 is kampan kaa phayda yah he ki iske kshetra main aane vaale sabhi jeevanu, vishaanu or sookshm jeev aadi nasht ho jate hai, jisase aasapaas kaa vaataavaran shuddh ho jaataa he
 This is the reason that in places where the sound of bells comes regularly, the atmosphere of the place is always pure and pure
 isi vajah se log apane daravaajon or khidakiyon par bhi wind chimes lagavate hai, taaki uski dhwani se nakaaratmak shaktiyaan hatati rahen
 Removing negativity opens the door to prosperity
 maa kii puja main bhuulakar bhi naa karen ye kaam
 
 
 These are also advantages - ringing a bell puts your presence before the gods
 manyata anusaar ghanti bajaane se mandir main sthapit devi-devataaon kii murtiyon main chetana jaagrit hoti he jiske baad unki puja or aradhana adhik faldaayak or prabhaavshaalee ban jaati he
 The adorable and auspicious sound of a bell has the potential to lead the mind-mind towards spirituality
 man ghanti kii lay se judakar shanti kaa anubhav karata he
 Ringing bells in the temple destroys the sins of many human births
 subah or shaam jab bhi mandir main puja yaa aarti hoti he to ek lay or vishesh dhun ke saath ghantiyaan bajaai jaati hai jisase vahaan maujuud logon ko shanti or divine upasthiti kii anubhuti hoti he
 Must visit Shri Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai - When the creation started, the sound (sound) was buzzing
 vahi aawaaj ghanti bajaane par bhi aati he
 The bell symbolizes the same sound
 yahi naad 'onkaar' ke uccharan se bhi jaagrit hota he
 At some places it is also written that when the holocaust comes, the same sound will be echoed at that time
 mandir ke baahar lagi ghanti yaa ghante ko kaal kaa pratik bhi mana gaya he
 Just after the hearing on the ramjanmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute in the Supreme Court, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has given a big statement on this
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha ki ram mandir kaa masalaa abhi court main he, 2019 ke chunaav main naukari, kisaanon se jude mudde par ahm honge
 Talking to Aaj Tak, Congress President Shahul Gandhi said, "ram temple matter is in court, but in 2019 elections, issues like jobs, farmers' concern, corruption will be important
" ’’gauratlab he ki shuukravaar ko hi supreme court main is masale par sunwaayee hui
 The Supreme Court has asked to set up a new bench to hear the matter, while the next hearing will be held on 10 January
 bataa den ki ram mandir kaa mudda loksabhaa chunaav se pehle garmaataa ja rahaa he
 Just a few days ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also gave a statement on this issue
 ek intervyuu main pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki ye maamla abhi court main he, aise main sarkaar nyaayik prakriya puraa hone kaa intjaar karegi
 Earlier even today, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad also said that the issue of Ram temple is in the court, whatever decision the Supreme Court will take, we will accept it
 ek ore congress ne jahaan is par court ke faisle kaa intjaar karne ko kaha he to vahiin shivasena kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ko jald se jald is par adhyadesh laana chahie
 Abdullah had said - Farooq Abdullah, leader of the Iconic Brick Organizational Conference, says that this issue should have been resolved by negotiation, should not even go to court
 faruk abdulla bole ki bhagwaan ram sabhi ke hai, kanoon banaakar ram mandir bananaa thik nahin he
 On the other hand, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut believes that hearing on the matter is important but the court hearing will not make the temple
 sarkaar ne koyala block aavanton mudde par kaig report par sansad main rukawat utpann kar rahi bhaajapa par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki vipaksh charchaa se bhaagna chahta he kyonki use dar he ki charchaa kaa kahin unheen par ulta prabhaav na pad jaae
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal said that obstruction is being created from the first day of the last Lok Sabha since the UPA came to power
 rukawat ab apwaad nahin rahaa balki ab to yah aam ho gaya he
 He said that after the arbitrary demand for the Prime Minister's resignation, the BJP did not realize what was in the matter and that is why they were running away from the discussion

 MP Asaduddin Owaisi has strongly criticized all such statements, reacting sharply to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader Indresh Kumar's beefed up statement when Home Minister Rajnath Singh compared the 1984 riots to incidents of increasing mob lynching in the country
 
 ovaisi ne kaha kirajanath sinhakaa bayaan sahi nahin he
 Why are they forgetting what happened in Gujarat in 2002, why are they forgetting what happened on December 6, 1992, why are they forgetting the bloodshed in Mumbai in January 1993? Sangh leader Indresh Kumar On the statement of Owaisi, are you threatening? Who are you to say this, what is the law for? Owaisi said that with such statements do you want to say that more Dalits and Muslims will be killed? Who are you to say such a thing, is there no constitution in the country? Is there no rule of law in the country? Does the country not have a court? If this happens, then there will be anarchy in the society and then what is the meaning of the court in such a situation? Owaisay said who are you, are you running this country? The country will not do with such statements
 haryana ke mukhyamantri bhi yahi baat karte hai joindresh kumaarakah rahe hai
 Do you want to make Muslims second-class citizens with such statements? There is no one to be afraid of these things of yours and if this continues, the law, parliament and constitution will all end

 Also, the examination will be conducted by Railway Recruitment Board and not IRCTC

 Filmmaker Prakash Jha has decided to make the film 'satsang', inspired by the controversial guru Asaram Bapu
 film ke bare main atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai ki abhinayta ajay devgan, arjuna rampal yaa manoj vaajapei main se koi ek asaram kii bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 When Arjun was asked about the film during an event, he said, "I too came to know about this news through newspapers this morning
" isse zyada mujhe kuch pataa nahin
 The comments unhone mazaakia andaaj main kaha, mujhe lagata he ki asaram baapu kaa kirdaar nibhaane ke liye mujhe bahut mehnat kerani padegi
 Really i have to work very hard to become Asaram Bapu
 khabar he ki 'satsang' asaram par haalia darj aparaadhik maamalon par bhi prakaash daalegi
 Let us know that Asaram has been booked under the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Harassment Act, including a case of rape of a 16-year-old teenager
 jab ek kaarykram ke dauraan arjuna se film ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, mujhe bhi is khabar ke bare main aaj subah hi akhabaaron ke jariye pataa chalaa he
 i don't know more than this
 tippaniyan He said jokingly, i think i have to work very hard to play the character of Asaram Bapu

 Rahul Gandhi lashed out at Narendra Modi on Wednesday
 na sirf notebandi par gherne kii koshish kii balki piem kaa majaak udaane kii koshish kii
 Rahul questioned Modi's yoga and said that Padmasana did not happen properly from PM
 jisase padmasana nahin ho saktaa, use yoga karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Let me tell you that Rahul Gandhi was giving a speech at the Jan Vedana Sammelan in Delhi
 modi ke yoga par rahul kaa nishanarahul gandhi ne kaha- main baaten notice karata hum
 Did a lot of yoga (PM) but did not do Padmasana
 mere yoga guru ne kaha tha jo yoga karata he wo padmasana kar saktaa he or jo yoga nahin karata wo padmasana nahin kar saktaa
 a day earlier, Modi had mentioned yoga, Modi, who went on a tour of Gujarat, mentioned a tweet on Tuesday
 modi ahmedabad main subah maa se milane gaye the
 After this, she tweeted and said- i could not do yoga this morning as i went to meet my mother

 loksabhaa chunaav main mili shikast ke baad samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh akhilesh yadav kah rahe hai ki vah ladaai ko samaj nahin paae
 But the manner in which he has consistently failed to understand the family and political relationship since 2012, the question arises whether he is unable to understand the Sachumach fight? Even though Akhilesh Yadav has been describing the alliance's relationship as unbreakable , But their partners are choosing a different path as soon as the opportunity comes
 chunavi haar ke baad mayawati jo sanket de rahi hai, yah uski baangi he
 For the moment, if you see these infidelities sequentially, the picture will be seen to be clear
 2012 kaa wo samay yaad karnaa chahie jab akhilesh yadav ne apni ranneeti kii badaulat uttar pradesh vidhansabha kaa chunaav jeetne main kamyaabi hasil kii thi
 In October 2011, his bicycle tour is considered to be a major contributor to the entire state
 us dauraan unke prachaar kii mashhoor tag line 'ummid kii cycle' ne vyaavhaarik taur par saral maane vaale akhilesh yadav ko mukhyamantri kii kursi tak pahunchaaya
 But after becoming the Chief Minister, the family relations between the political corridors and the walls of the house also started to break
 akhilesh yadav se kareebi logon ke alag hone kii kahani kaa plot koi ek din main taiyaar nahin hua
 Probably its background was set on the same day when Amar Singh advised Mulayam Singh Yadav to hand over the Samajwadi Party command to Akhilesh Yadav after a crushing defeat in Mayawati assembly elections in 2007
 mulaayam singh ne bhi 2012 main vidhansabha chunaav jeetne ke baad mukhyamantri pad kaa sapana dekh rahe apane bhai shivpal yadav kii jagah bete ko tarjeeh di or akhilesh yadav siem bane
 By 2017, the scope of the rift in the family had increased considerably and Mulayam Singh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav also got a stand against Akhilesh
 us dauraan paariwarik or raajnneetik viraasat ko sanbhaalane ko lekar chalaa siyaasi drama baharhaal itihaas ban chukaa he
 Here, Narendra Modi had become the Prime Minister after winning a big victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and it was believed that in 2017, there will be a Modi wave in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 isi ashanka ko dekhte hue akhilesh yadav ne 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke saath gathbandhan kaa faisla kiya, lekin kul 403 siton main se vah 356 siten ganvaa baithe, or congress kii raah juda ho gai
 This is both a shock and a lesson
 basapa ke samarthan se gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa upachunaav main mili jeet se utsahit akhilesh yadav ne mayawati kii party ke saath loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye gathbandhan main chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya
 But in this, Akhilesh's party could not even repeat its record of last Lok Sabha election while BSP won 10 seats
 ab jab chunaav nateezon ko lekar manthan kaa daur chal rahaa he to mayawati alag rasta akhriyaar karne kaa sanket de rahi hai
 He has announced to contest the 11 assembly by-elections, while the BSP has not contested the by-elections before
 mayawati ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki vah apana daanv chalakar aage badhane vishwaas karti hai
 Probably, he has proved this by announcing to contest the by-elections in all the 11 seats of the assembly being vacated
 lekin akhilesh yadav jis tareeke se loksabhaa chunaav main maahaul ko samaj nahin paae usee tarah vah raajnneetik rishton ko samajhane main peeche rah ja rahe hai
 That is why it is being said that since becoming the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, he is facing only infidelities

 The secret of this fact was revealed when Shalini Devi, wife of fake MLA Amarendra, reached there on December 31 and told that she is the wife of Amarendra Kumar Singh
 usee ne amrendra ko farji vidhayak bataaya or kaha ki na to vah koi purv vidhayak he or na hi koi janpratinidhi
 According to Shalini, Amarendra is originally a resident of Jayaprakash Nagar, Patna

 us mahila ke apharan kaa cese 6 november ko asanasol ke ek thane me darj karaayaa gaya tha
 After this incident, the girl's family is constantly calling Shalini
 jisase shalini pareshaan ho gai thi
 She then approached her husband and went to Ara to meet him, but this time also her husband escaped by dodging her
 is maamle par purv vidhayak or rajd ke pradesh mahasachiv bijendra yadav ne kaha ki aisa hua to aara ke circuit house main aatankwaadi bhi aakar aaraam se rah sakate hai
 While talking to caretaker Raju, he said that the room was allotted as per the order of the senior officer
 is baat kaa pataa kisi ko nahin chalaa ki vah farji vidhayak he
 At present, an application has been given to register a case in this case at Nawada police station
 is mamale ko gambhirtha se lete hue espi avkaash kumaar ne jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 The woman, who claimed to be the wife of the fake MLA, Shalini was also questioned

 SP Leave Kumar said that the matter is being investigated
 vyapaaree kii talash kii ja rahi he

 There was a stir in the atmosphere for some time
 iske baad gopal raay ne sthiti ko sambhalate hue kaha ki agali baar mahilaon ko training dekar samiti main jagah denge
 If the woman of a village wants to support the government, she reaches her name
 kaarykram ke dauraan adhikariyon par bhadke AAP ke vidhayakam aadmi party ke vidhayak bhi kaarykram ke dauraan adhikariyon par bhadak pade
 Actually, the name of the village associated with different assemblies was to be added to the committee, after which the committee spends the budget for the development of the village

 MLA commando Surendra said that he will complain about the whole matter by writing a letter to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal

 The note, prepared by the Mobility Directorate, said the Chinese company submitted the final report in November 2016 and a Chinese team suggested a face-to-face conversation after that
 haalanki, baatcheet ke liye taarikh nishchit nahin gai thi
 The note cited the lack of response from the Chinese Railways as the reason for the delay in the project

 The comments vahaan maujuud grahamantri rajnath singh ne turant halaat ko bhaanp liya or vimaanan mantri ke bachaav main unke najadik pahunch gaye

 Last week, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur was heard saying that states should reduce tax for this as demand increases
 to kya rajya mandi se lard sakate hai? kya pradhanmantri modi kii team india is mandi main unki madad kar sakati he?rajya sarkaron ke kul kharch or rajasav main kareeb 18 rajya 91 fisad kaa hissaa rakhte hai
 Government treasuries have played a major role in the collapse of the first quarter of this financial year in which the growth rate has fallen to five per cent
 • kharch ke aankade khangaalane par mandi badhane kii vajah haath lagati he
 States' expenditure in this quarter increased by less than the average of the previous three years
 har saal ek timahi main rajyon kaa kul vyay kareeb 15 fisad bad rahaa tha
 In this, capital or development expenditure generates demand, but in the quarter with a slope of five percent, the development expenditure of the states decreased by 19 percent
 keval chaar fisad kii badhat 2012 ke baad sabase kamjor he
 • Development or capital expenditure of the center was at a seven-year low in the ratio of GDP in 2018-19
 matlab yah ki jab arthvyavastha ko madad chahie tab centre or rajyon ne haath sikod liye
 Taxes increased, petrol and diesel also became expensive but demand-seeking expenditure did not increase
 to phir mandi kyon na aati?• rajyon ke rajasav main badhotaree kii dar is timahi main teji se giri
 The total revenue of the states is at the lowest level after 2012 but for the first time in nine years, the revenue collection of the states in the first quarter of a year has fallen so much
 centre ne jiesti se nuksaan kii bharpai kii guarantee na di hoti to musiibat ho jaati
 Only Jharkhand and Kashmir have increased revenue in 18 states
 centre sarkaar kaa rajasav to pehali timahi main keval 4 fisad kii dar se badha he jo 2015 se 2019 ke bich isi dauraan 25 fisad kii dar se badhata tha
 • Despite spending on scissors, the deficit of these states is at the highest level in three years
 aankadon par kareebi najar se pataa chalata he ki 13 rajyon ke khajaane to behad buree haalat main hai
 The condition of Chhattisgarh and Kerala is more slim
 18 main saat rajyon ke ghate pichley saal se zyada hai
 Among them are large states like Gujarat, Andhra, Karnataka, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh
 inke kharch main kami se mandi or gaharaai he
 Looking at the condition of the Center and the states together, there seems to be something that has not happened in the last several decades
 saal kii pehali timahi main centre or rajyon kii kamai ek fisad se bhi kam raftaar se badi, jo pichley teen saal main 14 fisad kii gati se bad rahi thi
 So there has been a record reduction in spending
 khajaanon ke aankade bataate hai ki mandi 18 maah se he lekin sarkaron ne apane kaamkaaj ko badalakar kharch kii disha thik nahin kii
 There is no development cost in the name of development and recession threatens
 ab rajasav main giravat or kharch main katautee kaa dushchakr shuru ho gaya
 This is the reason why the Central Government had to breach the Reserve Bank of India Reserve
 tamaam laanat-malamat ke baavjood sarkarein tex kam karne yaa kharch badhaane kii haalat main nahin hai
 So is the mismanagement of government budgets a major reason for the recession? The budget was blown into the electoral fray, the economy did not work! Governments do not know where to spend and income, savings and consumption kept falling! Now the options are limited
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ko mukhyamantriyon ke saath mandi par saajha ranneeti banani chahie
 The wheel of demand can be rotated by starting work on at least two major projects in each state with the right combination of costs
 lekin kya sarkarein apni galatiyon se kabhi sabak lengi! yaa saare sabak sirf aam logon kii kismat main likhe gaye hai!*** Five more cricket players have left Mumbai for the Test match to be played in New Zealand
 yah khilaadeen hai rahul dravid, vivies lakshmana, balaji, amit mishra or vijay

 Railways have increased the reservation quota of senior citizens by 50 per cent, meeting the announcements made in the budget and now about 90 seats will be reserved for them in the train
 senior citigen ko tohfarelvay board ke sadsy mohammad jamshed ne kaha ki varisht nagarikon ke liye adhik kota kii maang hoti rahi he or rail mantrisuresh prabhune bajet main isaki ghoshnaa kii thi

 You will remember that scene of Salman Khan's 'kick' movie, in which Salman crosses the track by watching his train very easily leaving his bicycle behind a few seconds before the arrival of the train on the rail track
 filmon main to kuch bhi ho saktaa he lekin kik movie ke is seen ko asal jindagi main copy kiya he ek noujvaan ne
 The man who carried out the stunt has posted a video of this kind on a social networking site in which he looks like Salman crossing the track easily till the train is near
 haalanki, is video pramanikta par ham muhar nahin laga rahe hai lekin is video ko dekhne ke baad lagata he ki yuvak ne train ke aane se chand second pehle trek paar kar liya he
 This may have been done with the help of video editing
 lekin chetavanee di jaati he ki asal jindagi main aap is tarah ke stant bilkul tri nahin karen

 ’ kamins ne kaha, ‘bada score banane ke liye aapako kaaphi gendon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he or yah un viketon main se ek he, jahaan aapako shuru main kadi mehnat kerani padati he

 The fast bowler said that in the absence of two of his best batsmen - Restricted Steve Smith and David Warner, the other players would have to perform better and give India a tough challenge in the remaining two days of the match
 kamins ne kaha, ‘hamen apane do sarvshereshth khilaadiyon kii kami khal rahi he, jo kaaphi mushkil he
 We know Steve Smith and David Warner will not be available

 agar jharkhand hoicourt se jamshedpur maamle main unhen raahat mil jaati he to baaki maamalon main bhi unke liye rasta aasaan ho jayega
 But if the High Court quashed the appeal, then it is possible that in the coming days, the courts of different Jharkhand may get swayed

 jab unki koshishen safal nahin huin to 20 saal kii is khilaadi ne isi saal rajya badal kar punjab jane kaa faisla kiya
 When the competition ended, he not only had a gold medal in his hand but he also got a place in the national camp
 rani kahati hai, ''vah medal mere liye ab tak sabase ahm he
 Without that, i would not have reached the national camp, nor could i participate in the trials
 '' usne aage joda, ''maine kai saal tak bina kisi puraskaar ke apane khel par mehnat kii he
 Once in 2017, i thought of leaving it, but my coach Saheb Singh Narwal encouraged me and asked me to stay in the game by trusting myself
 ''2010 main pita bhim sen kii mrityu ke baad se coach narwal hi manju ke sangrakshak hai
 Narwal also had his children in boxing, so he also trained Rani with them

 Manju Rani's second great support was mother Ishwati Devi living in her own village Rithal in Haryana

 In 2012, the mother, who is leading the life of her five children with the help of a nominal pension, asked the queen to pay attention to boxing
 rani bataati hai, ''ve mushkil bhare din the, phir bhi, maa ne mujhe koi kami nahin mahasoos hone di

 haalanki rus is maamle kii sanjidagi ko dekhte hue na to kisi kaa paksh le rahaa he balki bahut phoonk-phoonk kar kadam rakh rahaa he
 But this stir in Russia has made it clear that now the matter is serious
 ye to khayr hona hi tha, jis tarah trump or kim jong un khunnas kha kar ek-duusare ke khilaaf bayaan dete ja rahe hai is mukaam par to halaat aane hi the or ab aa bhi gaye
 Therefore, in the event of war, not only Korea, America and Japan will tighten their backs but Russia has also started sharpening its weapons
 rus main ye taiyaari kai charnon main shuru kii gai he or khud iskaa khulaasa rus kii sicurity council ke pramukh ne kiya he
 It was already decided that if the circumstances of the war were to prevail, then this war would not only involve North Korea and South Korea or America, but also Japan, China and Russia would have to be involved in it
 ek taraf north korea he jo lagaataar missile pe missile test kar ke khush ho rahaa he to duusari taraf america he jodakshin korea ke saath milakarmilitary drill karke kim jong un ko apni takat dikhaane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 But in the midst of all this, no one cares that if there is a war, it will turn into a nuclear war, whose destruction is difficult to predict

 If this verbal war really turns into war then we have to find ways to avoid it
 saath hi isse nipatane ke liye taiyaari bhi kerani hogi
 Although we have been continuously saying that war is not the solution to any problem
 zaruri ye he ki ham ise taalane kii koshish karen
 But since the situation seems to be getting worse, we must secure our areas along the border of North Korea

 This can be seen by the steps being taken in countries like Russia along the Korean border

 Have been deployed on the outskirts of India so that in the event of nuclear war, people are not allowed to enter Russia in case of displaced from North Korea
 haalanki rus, trump or kim jong un ke mizaaj ko bakhubi jaanata he, isliye behad phoonk-phoonk kar kadam rakh rahaa he
 But there is also a truth that between the two countries, if anyone can avoid war, it is Russia
 jahaan rus ne uttar korea kii sarhad par apane jangi faujee daston ko tainaat kiya he
 Where was China also going to stay behind
 china ne bhi uttar korea se lagati apni saharad par hajaaron phogiyon kii tainaati badha di he jisase aane vaale kisi bhi khatare se nipta ja sake
 Along with Russia, China also feels that if Trump trumps a big attack on North Korea, then it should not affect his country beyond the border
 lihaaza kootnithik taur par ye donon desh na to uttar korea ke saath khadey dikh rahe hai or na hi america ke saath
 But the difficulty for America is that if they take action without trusting these two countries, then both countries can also stand with North Korea

 ’ In many places, the price of onions is Rs 100, in Delhi, Rs 70-80 kilogram Kejriwal minister Imran Hussain wrote to the Union Minister Paswan, asked - finally, if the government buys 60 rupees onion, then how to buy it? is
 kai jagahon par pyaaj kii keemten 100 rupee kilo tak bad jane kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 In Delhi too, onion is being sold from Rs 70 to 80 per kg
 bijepi ne kejariwal sarkaar par dilli waalon ko sasti pyaaj muhaiyaa naa karaane ko lekar hamalaa kiya he
 At the same time, Kejriwal's Food Supplies Minister Imran Hussain has written a letter to Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan
 mahangi pyaaj ko lekar imran hossain ne kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan se poocha he ki aakhir 60 rupee kilo vaali pyaaj sarkaar kharide to kharide kaise
 In fact, in view of the shortage of interest in the country, the central government has imported onions from Egypt
 centre sarkaar kii ore se dilli ke mukhya sachiv ko 23 november ko ek chitthee bheji gai thi, jisamen bataaya gaya he ki sarkaar egypt se pyaaj manga rahi he, jo lagbhag 52 se 55 rupee kilo kii keemat main he or use alag-alag sarkaron ko nefed ke jariye 60 rupee prati kilo kii dar se bechaa jayega
 After 5 days of import, it is interesting that this onion import will also start only after 10 December
 pyaaj kii pehali khep dilli waalon ko 10 disambar ke baad hi milane vaali he
 Not only this, the price of onion coming from Egypt will be around 60 rupees per kg
 pyaaj kii isi mahangi keemat ko dekhte hue dilli sarkaar ke mantri imran hossain ne ramvilas paswan ko chitthee likhakar kaha he ki centre sarkaar use yaa to alvar se pyaaj degi yaa phir egypt se aayaat kii jane vaali pyaaj degi, vah bhi aayaat ke 5 dinon ke baad hi muhaiyaa hogi
 Kejriwal's minister got cheap onion for Delhi people, in the letter has written that when the Delhi government on behalf of the new flat of the central government 15
 60 rupee kilo pyaaj bechi gai tab vah dilli waalon ko 23
 Sold at the rate of Rs 90 per kg
 aise main agar centre sarkaar hi pyaaj 60 rupee kilo bechegi to itnaa mahangi pyaaj dilli ke logon ko sasti kaise milegi
 Kejriwal's minister has pleaded with Paswan to use the Central Government's price table mechanism fund to get him back through the lefit ie 15
 60 rupee paise prati kilo kii dar se hi pyaaj muhaiyaa karaae, taaki dilli waalon ko sasta pyaaj mil sake
 The price of onion reaching the public is 80 rupees, Delhi government minister Imran Hussain says that if she will buy onion at the rate of 60 rupees per kg from the central government itself, then onion reaching the public of Delhi, the price of this onion should be 80 rupees per kg
 While onions already exist in the market and on Mother Dairy at the rate of Rs 70 to 75 per kg, the public will not benefit
 kul milakar dilli kya puure desh ko philhal sasta pyaaj milane kii koi ummid dikhaai nahin padati

 'O people of my country, just fill the eyes with water
 jo shahid hue hai unki jaraa yaad karo qurbaani
 'this song has been saluting martyrdom for years
 is geet kii 51veen varshganth par somvaar ko mumbai main kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 In the program, along with tribute to the martyrs, Sur Empress Lata Mangeshkar was also honored
 lekin kaarykram main asal rang tab bharaa jab manch par maujuud narendra modi kii farmaaish par lata ji ne is geet ke antara ko phir se amar kar diya
 Political questions also arose because of Narendra Modi being the chief guest at this event held at Race Course Ground
 lekin is geet kaa kores har rang par baari padaa
 Lata Mangeshkar's eyes were moistened when the song first went to the National Stadium in Delhi on 27 January 1963
 51 saal baad 85 saal kii lataji ne jab aaj bhi mumbai main jab antara gaaya to yakeenan lakhon logon kaa galaa rundh gaya
 
 
 
 or khulata chalaa gaya yaadon kaa manzaris geet ke saath hi lata ji ko vah kahani bhi yaad ai jab 51 saal pehle gaanaa sunakar tatkaaleen pradhanmantri pandit jawahar laal nehru bhi rone lage the
 Every scene of the National Stadium opened in Lata ji's tongue
 kaise is geet ko alakh jagaanaa tha
 How poet Pradeep woven the fabric of this song
 barason tak kaise shrotaaon kii taraf se is geet ke liye jid bhari farmaaish hoti rahi
 Then Nehru now 51 years before Modi and poet Pradeep, when Lata ji did this song then Jawaharlal Nehru was on the stage, the first Prime Minister of the country and today Narendra Modi, who is bjp's PM candidate
 in do chehre ke saath 51 saal main rashtrawaad badal chukaa he
 Today, on the definition of nationalism, political ideologies stand against each other, the poet Pradeep emerged as an indisputable symbol
 30 ke dashak se hi wo hindi kavi ke rup mashhoor the
 Poets used to collect them separately in conferences and mushairs
 unki kavitaai or manch se adaayagi se prabhavit hokar mahakavi niraala ne 4 pannon kaa lekh diya tha
 As time progressed, he was criticized when Pradeep switched to films in the 40s
 magar yahaan wo apane andaaj main hi geet rachate rahe
 Urdu emerged as a Hindi songwriter among the poets who could not only write love songs but also raise the lyrics of patriotic songs
 geet likhane se kiya tha manabharat-china jang main haar ke baad 1963 main jab ek or deshbhakti geet likhane kaa mauka aayaa, to maayoos kavi ne pehle manaa kar diya
 The song written by Shakeel Badaunni was behind this, 'we cannot erase our freedom'
 kavi pradeep kii najar main isse behatar geet nahin likhaa ja saktaa tha
 Defeat in the battle was not knocking in Pradeep's chest, but despair was so dominant in that era that Kavithai would think well
 lekin ye baat mehboob khan jaise diarector kahaan maanane vaale the
 One day he reached Pradeep's house, insisting on writing something new for the martyrs
 mehboob khan ke jate hi kavi kaa man apni dhun or kalam ke saath jute gaya
 Pradeep struggled to write songs for several days
 us din wo samandar ke kinare tahal rahe the, jab jehan main ek khyaal kaundha
 It is thought that there is no caste, religion or community for those soldiers ahead of the country
 sabase aage vatan he
 Geetkavi Pradeep, who wrote on the cigarette wrapper, thought the song, but he did not have a piece of paper to write
 aise main unhone jeb se cigarette kaa packet nikaala or uske andar silver work vaala raper nikaalar us par ye geet likhaa
 The song was echoing in Lata ji's sun on 27 January 1963 at the National Stadium in Delhi
 us geet par bhav-vibhor hue nehru ji kii ankhon se jharjhar gir rahe the
 But the poet Pradeep was not present to see that historical moment
 kavi pradeep kii beti mitul padrip ke anusaar, kaarykram ke hissaa lene ke liye unke pita ko nahin bulaayaa gaya tha
 Although Lata ji sang thousands of songs, but hearing this song, her eyes are still filled
 vah ise apana sabase pasandida or sabase asardaar geet maanati hai
