 Ramadan has started, a tradition of fasting since the moon is seen
 aane vaale ek maheene main muslim samudaay roje rakhkar allaah kii ibaadat karegaa
 It is important to keep in mind certain things throughout the month of Ramadan
 aaie jaanate hai koun si baton ko dhyaan main rakhkar roje rakhane chahie:1
 Every night of Ramadan, man can set fast for the next day
 behatar yahi he ki ramajaan ke maheene kii pehali raat ko hi puure maheene ke roje kii niyat kar len
 2
 agar koi ramajaan ke maheene main jaanboojh kar ramajaan ke roje ke alaava kisi or roje kii niyat kare to wo rojaa kubul nahin hoga or naa hi wo ramajaan ke roje main shumaar hoga
 3
 behatar he ki aap ramajaan kaa maheenaa shuy hone se pehle hi puure maheene kii jarurat kaa saamaan kharid len, taaki aapako roje kii haalat main baahar naa bhatakana pade or aap zyada se zyada vakt ibaadat main bitaa saken
 4
 ramajaan ke maheene main iftaar ke baad zyada se zyada pani peeyen
 After a day's fast, there is a lot of lack of water in the body
 mardon ko kam se 2
 5 liters and women must drink at least 2 liters of water
 5
 Start Iftar with light food
 khajur se iftaar karnaa behatar mana gaya he
 Eat and drink more water, salads, fruits, juices and soups in Iftar
 isse sharir main pani kii kami puri hogi
 6
 sahari main zyada tala, masaaledaar, meetha khaanaa na khaaen, kyunki aise khaane se pyaas zyada lagati he
 Oatmeal, milk, bread and fruit in Sahari are good for health
 7
 Pray more and more in the month of Ramadan, Allah should agree because in this month the duty of doing noble work is increased
 8
 Recite more and more in Ramadan by referring to the Quranic recitation, the prohibition of Namaz, Zakat, Sadak and Allah
 rojedaaron ko iftaar karana bahut hi sawab kaa kaam mana gaya he
 9
 agar koi shaks sahari ke vakt roje kii niyat kare or so jaae, phir neend magarib ke baad khule to uskaa rojaa mana jayega, ye rojaa sahi he
 10
 ramajaan ke maheene ko teen asharon main baanta gaya he
 The first 10 days are called the first Ashra which is of Rahmat
 doosraa ashara agle 10 din ko kehete hai jo magafirat kaa he or teesraa ashara aakhri 10 din ko kaha jaataa he jo ki jahannam se aajaati kaa he
 11
 agar koi rojedaar roje kii haalat main jaanboojhkar kuch kha le to uskaa rojaa tutaa jaataa he, lekin agar koi galati se kuch kha-pi le to uskaa rojaa nahin tuutata he
 12
 agar koi biimaar shaks ramajaan ke maheene main johar se pehle thik ho jaataa he or tab tak usne koi aisa kaam nahin kiya ho jisase rojaa tuutata ho, to niyat karke uskaa us din kaa rojaa rakhana jaruri he
 13
 agar rojedaar daant main fansaa hua khaanaa jaanboojhkar nigal jaataa he to uskaa rojaa tut jaataa he
 14
 munh kaa pani nigalane se rojaa nahin tuutata he
 If the desire of eating something tasty comes to the mouth water, then swallowing that water does not break the fast
 15
 During the month of Ramadan, man stays away from bad cries, Ramadan month is very good for quitting cigarette addiction
 rojaa rakhkar cigarette yaa tambaakoo khaane se rojaa tut jaataa he
 16
 roje kii haalat main daant nikalwane se rojaa makaruh ho jaataa he, yaa roje main koi aisa kaam karne se jisase munh se khun nikalne lage, isse bhi rojaa makaruh ho jaataa he
 17
 aapane agar roje kii haalat main puri tarah se geele kapade pahan rakhe hai to aapkaa rojaa makaruh ho saktaa he
 18
 koi khaane kii cheez jiske khaane se rojaa tut jaataa he, jabardastee kisi rojedaar ke halak main daal diya jaae or wo use nigal jaae to rojaa nahin tuutata he
 19
 agar kisi rojedaar ko jaan or maal ke nuksaan kii dhamkee dekar koi khaanaa khaane ko majaboor karata he or rojedaar us nuksaan se bachane ke liye khaanaa kha letaa he to rojaa nahin tuutata he
 20
 ramajaan ke maheene main nekiyon kaa sawab 10 se 700 guna tak badha diya jaataa he
 The reward of Nafl Namaz is equal to the duty and the duty of the prayer becomes equal to 70 duty
 21
 In the month of Ramadan, Allah takes special care of his bandits and accepts his every rightful prayer
 ramajaan main jananath ke daravaaje khol die jate hai or jahannum ke daravaaje band kar die jate hai
 22
 ramajaan main namaaj ke baad quran paak kii tilavat kii aadat daalen, iskaa bahut sawab he
 Take some time in Ramadan and listen to the quran-e-majeed, because the length and length of Ramadan is of worship and worship
 23
 During the month of Ramadan, try to be on your side all the time
 raat ko jaldi sone kii aadat daalen taaki aap fajr kii namaaj ke liye uth saken
 24
 har raat sone se pehle apane kiye hue aamaal ke bare main jarur sochen
 Thank Allah for your good faith, and apologize to Allah for your mistakes and bestiality
 25
 In the month of Ramadan, make a habit of doing Saddaka daily, even if only a little
 ise apni rosemara kii jindagi kaa hissaa banaaen
 26
 ramajaan main nafl namaajon kaa tahajud kii namaaj kii tarah ehtemaam karen, bahut sawab he
 Spend more and more time in Quran and Hadith, Fiqh and Islamic books
 27
 Give an Iftar party to someone who is knowledgeable to you, you will feel that your relationship has become stronger
 koshish karen ki ghar main tamaam log ekasaath aapas main milakar iftaar karen
 28
 ramajaan main apni tamaam buree aadaton ko chhod den or is ba-barkat maheene kaa istemaal nek kaamon main karen
 Always remember and take care of your neighbors in Ramadan

 That is why he never calls me and i also never call him

 Shilpa's son Vian looks quite inspired by actor Tiger Shroff
 photo main ve white marshall art outfit pahanestantkarte hue dikh rahe hai
 Vian has got this habit of staying fit, probably from his Mancilpa Shetty
 ve bollywood kii most feet actress kii list main shumaar hai
 She looks very young even at the age of 43
 unke fashneble andaaj or style sens ke sabhi kaayal hai
 a few days ago a fitness video of Ajay Devgan's son also went viral
 unhone # humfittohindiafit fitness chalange liya tha
 This 7-year-old teen age fitness video surprised many
 choti umr main jis tarah yug gym main workout karte dikh rahe the wo kaabiletarif tha
 a new discussion has started in the Congress party about old leaders
 janardan dvivedi kaa kahana he ki 70 saal se adhik umr ke netaaon ko sakriyaraajnneeti se sanyas le lenaa chahie
 He should play the role of advisor
 unka maananaa he ki saarvajanik jivan main rahane waalon ke liebhi anya profeshnals kii tarah umr kii seemaa honi chahie
 Those in important positions of the party have to run a lot and the younger people are suitable for them
 isse pehle purv mantri jairam ramesh ne kaha tha ki congress ke wo netaa jo 70 saal ke ho chuke hon, ritair ho jaaen
 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had already exuded more confidence in young leaders
 udhar piem modi ne apane dal main buudhe netaaon ko sakriy padon se baahar kar diya he
 Most of the leaders in his core team are young and he is confident in them
 laal krishna adwani or murali manohar joshi sareekhe netaaon ko kinare kiye jane ke baad yah baat saaf ho gai he ki bijepi main ab buudhe netaaon ke liye koi sakriy jagah nahin he
 The irony of Indian politics has been that old leaders continue to dominate most important positions
 kai raajnneetik netaa jo shaareerikrup se bhi aksham rahete the, vah bhi mahatvapurn padon par virajman ho jate rahe hai
 An example of this is the appointment of Sis Ram Ola as a minister at the age of 86
 vah mahaj chah maheene hi is pad par rah paae or swarg sidhaar gaye
 It is clear to say that it is not prudent to give ministers or such important posts to older age leaders
 shaareerik rup se ve utane shashakt nahin hote hai or na hi us umr main buddhi saath depaati he
 Even more important is that there is no shortage of less able politicians in the country of 1
25 billion people
 har party main yuva yaa kam bujurg netaa hai jo har mahatvapurn padon par kahin behatar dhang se kaam kar sakate hai
 Their productivity will also be much higher
 aaj ke badalte vakt main netaaon tathaa mahatvapurn padon par baithe logon ko bhi tej gati se kaam karnaa hota he
 It will be appropriate to give more responsibility to those people who are physically and mentally capable
 bharat duniya kaa sabase yuva desh hone ja rahaa he jahaan yuvaaon kii sankhya sabase zyada hogi
 In such a situation, there is a need for politicians who think like them
 unki aakankshaon or ummiido ko samajhnaa hoga
 If the country has to run better then they should have maximum participation
 har party ko yah baat samajni hogi
 BJP has started this
 congress main is par chintan shuru hua he
 This is a good sign and will see good results in the coming days

 According to sources, when the terrorists kidnapped unarmed Omar, he told him that if he left the army, he would not kill him, but how would Omar let his dream die
 jab umr ne fouj chhodane se manaa kiya to kareeb das aatankiyon ne milakar fouj ke is jabanj ko maar daalaa
 The army says of course Omar is no longer among us, but the army will leave no stone unturned to fulfill the dreams he has dreamed of
 vaise sahi myne main sena ke leftinent umr faiyaz ko sachhee shradhanjali tabhi hogi jab keval sena nahin balki kashmir kaa har yuva kahe ki uske adarsh umr hai or har kisi ko umr jaisaa hi bananaa he
 No matter how much the terrorists threaten, but in no case will they step back

 By the way, the true tribute to the army's lieutenant Omar Fayaz will be only when not only the army but every youth of Kashmir says that his ideals are Omar and everyone has to be like Omar

 Amarnath Yatra has been stopped due to terrorist threat
 jammu kashmir ke grih sachiv ne amarnath yatriyon or paryatakon ko adwijuri kar unhen turant ghati chhodane kii salaah di he
 After the advisory, Amarnath pilgrims are returning from Kashmir
 jaankaree ke anusaar jab yah faisla liya gaya to kuch yatri raste ke bich main the, jabaki kuch stesan ke ird gird hi the
 All of them are now returning to their respective destinations from there
 darasal, suraksha balon ko amarnath yatra ke root par search oparation ke dauraan sniper rifl mili, jiske baad yatra rokane kaa faisla kiya gaya
 Sensing the terror threat, it was immediately advisable that wherever the Amarnath pilgrims are on the Amarnath Yatra route, they should try to return to their homes, because a big conspiracy is being hatched
 jammu kashmir ke grihasachiv ne adwijuri main likhaa he ki aatanki khatre, khaastaur par amarnath yatra ko nishaanaa banane ke khatre par khufia vibhaag ke taaja input or kashmir ghati ke suraksha halaat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue amarnath yatriyon or paryatakon ke hit main ye salaah di jaati he ki wo turant ghati main apane tehraav ko chota karen or jitna jald ho sake waapas lautne ke upaay karen
 The Amarnath Yatra was scheduled to end on August 15, but this advisory means it has been informally halted
 isse pehle siarpief, jammu-kashmir police or sena ne srinagar main press conference kar ye daawa kiya ki amarnath yatriyon par sniper se hamale kii koshish ko surakshabalon ne puri tarah naakaam kar diya
 It is a big relief to foil the terror conspiracy hovering over the Amarnath Yatra, but in this way, Baba Barfani's advice to the devotees to leave the journey and return home will raise questions that till now the atmosphere was hot on the fact that the government had 25 thousand additional soldiers in Kashmir
 Is sending aise main is adwijuri se ye sawaal uthenge ki kya kashmir main sab kuch thik he? kya kashmir main kuch bada hone vaala he? kya sarkaar amarnath yatra maarg ko surakshit banane main naakaam rahi?

 In this, a notification was issued to increase the salary from one lakh ten thousand rupees to three lakh fifty thousand rupees
 haalanki rajbhavan main hone vaale tamaam kharchon ko rajya sarkaar vahan karti he
 In this, the expenditure of all government and non-governmental events happening in the Raj Bhavan is spent from the government treasury

 The special thing is that Raj Bhavan's budget has been kept in the unacountable category

 At the moment, it will be imperative to see how many other governors of the country will follow this initiative of Governor Balramdas Tandon

 pehle banaras, phir agra or iske agle din meerut main 'rashtrodayah swayamsevak samagam' ke jariye aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ne jatiyon ko jodne kii jugat shuru kar di he
 The Sangh has come up with a new definition of 'hindutva and bigotry' by conveying equality from non-political platform in ethnic and ideological differences, in which Hindutva means whole country and fundamentalism means liberality
 lekin siyaasi nihitarth vaala sangh kaa yah agenda kya vastav main un jatiyon or vichaardhaaraon ko aakarshith kar paa rahaa he jo raajnneeti ke maidan main bhaajapa ko virdohi yaa khud ko 'bhagava peedit' maanati hai?yah jaan lenaa jaruri he ki yah sawaal kyon uthaa or aresas ko soshal ejineering kii jarurat kyon padi? darasal, 2014 ke aam chunaav main jin hindu maton kaa dhruvikaran bhaajapa kii taraf tha, unamem anya pichhadaa varg or daliton kii nirnaayak taadaad shaamil thi
 This equation remained intact in the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections but decreased in the proportion of 2014
 iske peeche bhaajapa shasit rajyon kii ghatnaon ke alaava bihar chunaav se pehle sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ke aarakshan khatm karne vaale bayaan ko bhi dekha jaataa he
 The social engineering of the Sangh has increased after the incidents of ethnic violence between Dalits and Rajputs in Shabbirpur village of Saharanpur district after the formation of BJP government in Uttar Pradesh
 pradesh main is par sakriyata or satarkta saaf dikhaai detii he, kyonki kendriya satta tak pahunchane kaa rasta uttar pradesh ke bina sambhav nahin he
 In 2014, the BJP and allies got 73 Lok Sabha seats from UP itself and western Uttar Pradesh had a significant contribution in this
 meerut ke 'rashtrodayah swayamsevak samagam' ke duusare din, 25 farvari ko sangh pramukh bhagwat ne do lakh se adhik swayamsevakon ko apane sambodhan main sandesh diya, ''vyakti main udaartaa or ahimsa ke liye kattarta honi chahie
 Values like sacrifice and restraint do not belong to any one worship or sect
 kattar hindutv kaa matlab kattar ahimsa or kattar udaartaa se he
 We have forgotten ourselves and fight among the castes
 hamaare jhagadon kii aag par sari duniya rotiyaan senkati he
 "bhagwat has already said," Every person living in India is a Hindu
 ''darasal bhagwat ke meerut sambodhan ke sandesh ko 23 farvari ko agra main unke 'samarasata sangam' manch ke baraabar main ek bada hording spasht kar rahaa tha
 In the midst of the hoarding, Lord Rama, eating the plum from the hands of Shabari, and the images of Sant Ravidas, Sant Kabirdas, Maharishi Valmiki and Gautama Buddha around it and all the saints and Mahatmas of the society sitting on the second platform a short distance away
 yani varanasi se lekar tajanagari agra or meerut tak sandesh saaf he ki sangh 2019 se pehle jatiyon ko jodne nikal padaa he
 Such conferences of the Sangh have taken place before but never before with saffron
 agra main sant mahatmaon ke manch ke neeche lage nile binar par likhaa tha, ''samras jivan se tuutegi bhedbhaav kii dhara, isse hi ekatm hua he sara raashtra hamaara
 '' The venue of the conference in Meerut was illuminated with blue light at night
 iske peeche kii ek badi vajah bataate hue piples union for civil liberties, uttar pradesh ke sachiv ramkumar kehete hai, ''har baar sangh aage aata he, gale lagane, jati jodne kii baat karata he lekin jati todane kii pahal nahin hoti

 Once again, the pressure of politicians sitting in Parliament other than intellectuals and historians has led to a change in the curriculum of the students as per their choice
 pichley saal sansad ke monsoon satr ke dauraan bhartiya janata party or bahujan samaaj party ke saansadon ne rajyasabha main apni is maang ko lekar kaaphi hangaamaa kiya
 To the extent that the House had to adjourn twice

 Now did the council agree to the rationality of this demand or did it come under pressure from politicians? When India Today tried to talk to council director mathematician Parveen Sinclair in this regard, he refused to comment

 But it is not appropriate to make any change at any time by the whims and desires of a man, even if he is a politician

 hamane poocha ki aakhir ve us netaa kii jagah kyon nahin lenaa chaahate, to unka jawaab sapaat hota he ki gujarat main unka kaam abhi puraa nahin hua he, ‘‘main gujarat ko adhiktar viksit deshon se zyada viksit bananaa chahta” (baatcheet)
 Modi is emerging as a clear winner in the opinion poll
 gujarat ke 56 fisadi matadaata unhen bharat kaa aglaa pradhanmantri dekhnaa chaahate hai or is maamle main rahul gandhi se ve kaaphi aage bane hue hai
 His own party's rivals such as Sushma Swaraj, Nitin Gadkari and Arun Jaitley have not even crossed the double ten in the survey and have become irrelevant to Modi
 jaisaa ki surveykshan dikhaata he, modi kii lokapriyata unke vikaas ke record (unki sabase badi uplabdhi) or bhrashtachar ke daag se mukt ek eemaandaar chhavi (unki sabase badi takat) se milakar bani he
 If you put the message of change that Modi is writing, keeping it in the political context, then the picture will be clear
 masalan, dilli main manmohan singh aarthik sudhaaron ke apane aakhri daanv ke baavjood ab aadhuniktaa ke pratik nahin rah gaye hai, balki iske ulat ve tehre hue bharat kaa pratik ban gaye he kyonki unke daur main hi bharat bhrashtachar or rajnatik gaiyr-javabdehi ke daldal main dhansata chalaa gaya he
 Today Modi is finding a place as the modern face of India on the cover and editorial pages of international publications
 britain unka sabase taaja prashansak banakar ubhara he, jisane 2002 ke baad se gujarat ko kaali suchi main daal rakhaa tha
 In a press conference held after a much publicized meeting with Modi in Gandhinagar, the British High Commissioner said that it was in Britain's national interest to have a relationship with Modi and 'bibrant Gujarat'
 bhartiya korporate jagat kaa ek prabhaavshaalee tabaka pehle hi desh ke pradhanmantri ke taur par sabase yogya ummidavaar ke rup main un par muhar laga chukaa he
 His own party survives, so everyone within him is seen as a dwarf because Modi is the only leader who appeals from the grassroots to the boardroom and all this has come at a time when the party president himself struggles to save his credibility (report on Nitin Gadkari)
 ahmedabad sthit ek outsorcing company motiff ke sansthaapak or siio kaushal mehta kehete hai, ‘‘modi jaisaa saaf-suthra vyakti yadi pradhanmantri ban jaataa he to ek raashtra ke rup main bharat ke liye yah bilkul anoothaa anubhav hoga
 i am confident that he will become the Prime Minister
 ” gujarat neshnal lau uniwarsity ke bimal en
 According to Patel, Modi is "the greatest Gujarati born to date
 ” sanyukt raashtra ke saath vidhi visheshgy ke taur par kaam kar chuke patel maanate hai ki ‘‘aaj gandhinagar main rahanaa pashchimi europe ke kisi bhi sthaan par rahane ke baraabar kaa anubhav he
 "such praise may have originated from the sense of Gujarati splendor, but as the opinion poll also shows, Modi's rise as an administrator rests on three qualities that are rare in current Indian politics: honesty, economic front But in the context of ensuring positive results and ensuring the future of the youth, such credibility which no leader of India has today
 samruddhi kaa yah modivaadi suchakank chunaav prachaar se nahin upja he, aankade bhi isaki taakid karte hai
 Take a look at some figures
 modi ke netritv main gujarat ne china kii tarah dohare ankon main vruddhi kii he
 During the last 10 years, the agricultural sector in the state has grown to 10
 97 fisadi kii dar se vruddhi kii, jo bharat main sarvaadhik he
 All the cities and almost all the villages of the state get electricity round the clock
 ahmedabad ke kareeb unhone jo automobile audyogic centre sthapit kiya he, vah safalataa kii kahani ban chukaa he
 No wonder, most voters believe that the 2012 election results will be determined by the issue of development and for most people the industrialization in the state has created massive employment opportunities
 itnaa sab kehane ke baavjood dhyaan dene vaali baat he ki 2002 main nafrat kaa jo udyog yahaan lagaaya gaya tha, uskaa asar ab tak puri tarah gaayab nahin hua he
 It is another matter that 60 percent of the voters do not consider Modi responsible for the riots
 lekin musalamaanon ke bich ve ab bhi alokapriy haih 61 fisadi muslim unhen vot nahin karenge, 50 fisadi se zyada muslim maanate hai ki pichley paanch saal main modi ne unke saath samaan bartaav nahin kiya jabaki 55 fisadi aise muslim hai jinka kahana he ki modi agar dangon ke liye maafee maang len tab bhi ve unhen vot nahin denge
 Modi, whose rally is not complete without Muslim caps, does not give much credibility to the election analysis
 india today se unhone kaha, ‘‘main vot bank kii raajnneeti nahin karata
 Six crore Gujaratis belong to my family
 ”kareeb do saal tak adalati faisle ke kaaran rajnatik vanvaas par rahe modi ke sabase ahm sipahasaalar amit shah aajkal apni vaapasi par foole nahin samaa rahe
 In speaking to India Today, he is unable to speak diplomatic language like Modi
 shah kehete hai, ‘‘modi ko bhul jaaie, bijepi ko hi muslim kabhi sweekaar nahin kar sakate
 If you believe the stories that surround Modi's political aura, then the people of Gandhinagar appreciate none other than Modi, they are the only Shah
 apane netaa ke peeche khadey hone kii baari aati he to shah koi ghalmail nahin karte, ‘‘nehru ke baad sabase bade vaktaa
 
 
 There is no substitute for Modi as Prime Minister
 yah to hona hi he
 They do not say anything about when this will happen
 unhen sabase zyada gussa un logon par aata he jinhone unke aakaa ko badnaam karke janata kii dharanaon ke saath khilwaad kiya he
 He says, "how can they call him Hitler?" Modi is the biggest victim of the relaxation in democracy
 itnaa hi nahin, kuch log ninsaphi or tushtikaran ke prati unki sakhti ko unki aakraamakata ke taur par prachaarit kar rahe hai
 At least we cannot compromise with the people to change their perception and when they are not responsible for the 2002 riots, then why should they apologize? ”despite this, you should go to the Congress office in Ahmedabad Everyone will be cursed by Modi
 nagar nikaay main vipaksh ke netaa badaruddin shaikh ke liye ‘‘modi ek shaitan he or uske naam se hi musalamaanon ko dar lagata he
 "state Congress chief Arjun Modhwadia, convinced of the change of power in Gandhinagar, says that he has lost his friends and associates" due to the "state-sponsored massacre in Gujarat"
 ”modi dwaara bahuprachaarit muslim samarthan kii pole kholte hue modhwadiya india today ko bataate hai ki soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat unhone pataa kiya he ki ek jila prashaasak ne bijepi kaaryakartaaon ke bich baantne ke liye 10,000 muslim tapiyaan kharidi thim
 Describing Modi's gentle touch as a political drama, he claims, "all the people wearing Muslim hats in Modi's publicity rally are not necessarily Muslims
" mere paas saboot to nahin, lekin main aapako bataa saktaa hum ki bijepi burka bhi baantati he
 "modi was invited to come to Balasinor by Begum Farhat, who does not wear the burqa herself
" ve india today se kahati hai, ‘‘vakt aa gaya he ki muslim samudaay 2002 ko peeche chhod de
 When they talk about the welfare of six crore Gujaratis, no sensible person should see any fault in it
 ”siyasat ke bazaar main modi bestsaling vichaar hai
 An idea that challenges flat narratives, which misses no opportunity to enter the psyche of India
 modi prerana hai, modi dhamkee hai
 The more easily they are appreciated, the more easily they excite
 jis shaks ko adhiktar bhartiya apana aglaa pradhanmantri dekhnaa chaahate hon, uskaa khyal ativaadee bhavanaaen paidaa karata he
 Although his loved ones also believe that Modi's sentiments are not as transparent, perhaps that is why he is praised by people but not loved
 jaisaa ki unke chaahane vaale ek siio kehete hai, ‘‘unki chhavi ko durust kiye jane kii jarurat he
 "it is also possible that the man who rides the waves of the waves of Indian politics will show his passion after reaching his last destination"

 dilli bijepi yuva morcha ke kaaryakarta bike par savaar hokar punjab ravaanaa hue
 It is interesting that these young BJP workers are not going to promote the party in Punjab, but are going to open the poll of Delhi Chief Minister Arvid Kejriwal
 bijepi kii ranneeti ek tir se do shikaar karne kii he
 One is to promote the failures of Kejriwal while in Delhi government and on this pretext, the party will also campaign in 23 seats in Punjab

 According to Delhi Yuva Morcha president Sunil Yadav, the party has prepared a report on the functioning of the Kejriwal government in Delhi
 is report menkejariwal ke chunaavake pehle kiye gaye 70 vaadon ko aadhaar banaaya he
 Going to Punjab, BJP workers will now warn voters there that just like the Aam Aadmi Party has made false promises in Delhi, in the same way Kejriwal and his party are trying to deceive the people of Punjab
 isiilie wo saavdhaan rahen
 Delhi BJP has prepared publicity material about the failures of the government in Delhi
 jisamen free wifai, mahilaon kii suraksha, nae skulon kaa nirmaan or sisitivi camaron kii baat kii gai he
 Delhi BSP president Manoj Tiwari said that after cheating Delhi, Kejriwal has fled to Punjab, so his workers are reaching Punjab to remind him of the acts done from Delhi

 At a time when any idea against the opinion of the ruling party is stamped as anti-national, Pratap Bhanu Mehta openly blames the recent governments, especially the current government, for frustrating the hopes of the people
 
 rashtrawaad, sachaai, aazaadee, press kii swatantraaa, dharm or sabhyataa, mulyon or sansthaaon par kabja aadi ko ek-ek kar ginate hue udaahranon ke saath mehta ne bataaya ki kis tarah bharat ek ''asantusht vyaktiyon, kshudra maansiktaaon or sankeern vichaar rakhane waalon'' kaa desh ban chukaa he
 They believe that Indian democracy is currently in deep crisis and today the expectation is becoming less than it was five or 10 years ago
 mehta kaa kahana tha ki vipaksh bhi is prakriya main sahabhaagi he or kisi bhi sarkaar ne naagarik swatantraaa ke liye kaam nahin kiya he
 Strange things are very high in the 2019 election
 agar satta kaa santulan behaal nahin hua to loktantr khatre main pad jayega
 But ironically, expectations are very low in this election
 pichley 10-15 saal main jo ummiden jaagi thim ki bharat dhanchaagat badlaav ke muhane par khadaa he, bharat growth, samavesh or rojgaar paidaa karne ke maamle main nae str par pahunch jayega, mujhe lagata he ki ve sari ummiden dhoomil hui hai
 Mehta warned that the idea of india was going to decline and said that it is becoming a threat to the country's national unity, fundamental constitutional values and personal freedom, and it is giving rise to a mass culture that allows the countrymen to interact with each other
 Divides into bolne kii swatantraaa jo loktantr kii aadharshila he, par hamalaa kiya ja rahaa he
 Mehta lashed out at the opposition for not shutting it down and not supporting the new demands for civil liberties
 mehta kaa kahana tha ki bhrashtachar par bhi lagaam nahin lagaai gai he or bhartiya arthvyavastha par paise waalon kii pakad kam nahin hui he
 He said, "can you think of any other big economy in the world where a small group of magnates control a very large number of important sectors? vastav main yahi bhrashtachar he
 "something is happening to our democracy which is destroying the soul of democracy itself

 chaar dinon kaa hota he chhath parv or har din kaa apana alag mahatv he
 But what matters most is the conclusion of Chhath Vrat
 is khaas din kya khaas niyam or saavdhaaniyaan baraten jisase aapkaa ye vrath or bhi laabhakaari ho sake
 According to astrologers, if the fast of Kartik's Chhath is kept with the right rules and true devotion, the results are also miraculous
 dhan, aishwarya or aarogy barasaane vaala he chhath kaa ye mahakalyankari vrath
 You must also take the blessings of the sun god on Chhath festival
 aapaki kismat bhi sanvar jaaegi
 These are the rules and precautions for the completion of Chhath Vrat: - Finish Chhath Vrat by drinking lemonade only

 - After the last arghya, distribute prasad among all people
 - nadi ke jal ko ganda na karen , saafe safai kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhen
 The festival of Chhath is beneficial for everyone, but it is not possible to keep this fast for everyone, but there are some measures through which you can get the full benefit of Chhath fast without fasting
 jaane bina vrath rakhe kaise paaen surya kii vishesh krupa:- chhath parv ke dauraan chaaron din puri safai or satviktaa baraten
 - Serve and help any sixth fast
 - gud or aate kii vishesh mithai 'thekua' jarur banaaen
 - Then divide it among the poor and children
 - chhath ke donon hi arghya jarur den or surya dev se krupa kii prarthana karen
 - Please take blessings by touching the feet of those observing Chhath fast

 Rahul Gandhi has resigned from the post of Congress President
 istife kaa patr saarvajanik kar aage kii sari sambhaavnaaon ko rahul ne khatm kar diya
 At the same time, the Congress has also taken a step towards keeping the 'gandhi family' free
 isi ke maddenjar rahul gandhi ne ek lakeer bhi khinch di he ki congress kaa nayaa adhyaksh 'gandhi parivaar' ke baahar kaa hi hoga
 Rahul Gandhi has taken this decision at a time when the Congress is going through its worst phase
 itnaa hi nahin loksabhaa chunaav ke baad party puri tarah se majdhaar main fansi hui najar aa rahi he
 In such a political atmosphere, the steps taken by the Congress President to step down and take a new political experiment raises the question whether Rahul is taking political risk anywhere
 rahul gandhi ke is faisle ke saath hi yah saaf ho gaya he ki 21 saal baad congress kii kaman ek baar phir nehru-gandhi parivaar se baahar kisi or netaa ke haath main hogi
 After Indira and Rajiv, Sonia Gandhi became president in 1998 from the 'gandhi family' and held the post till 2017
 is dauraan congress 10 saal tak centre kii satta par kabiz rahi
 Rahul Gandhi was crowned as Congress President in December 2017 after Sonia Gandhi
 haalanki rahul gandhi ne 2004 main raajnneetik entry kii thi or 2007 main rashtriya mahasachiv bane or baad main upaadhyaksh ke pad rahe
 During this time, Rahul Gandhi tried to raise the Congress organization on the lines of Lyngdoh Committee
 iske alaava kai pratyaashiyon ke liye kai raajnneetik prayog kiye the, jinamein vah safal nahin ho sake
 Rahulrahul, who failed in the political experiment, preferred the election instead of being directly elected to the positions of NSUI and Youth Congress organization
 upaadhyaksh rahete hue rahul gandhi ne chunaav main candidet ko maidan main utaarne se pehle pratyaashee chayan ke liye usee ke kshetra main baqayda voting prakriya ke formule ko aajamaaya gaya
 In this year's Lok Sabha elections, Rahul gave importance to Shakti App in the selection of candidates
 in teenon prayog main buree tarah se rahul gandhi fail rahe hai
 In such a situation, the question arises that how far Rahul Gandhi will be successful in the move to free the Congress from the mentality of the Gandhi family? The Youth Congress did not have the same 1977 as senior journalist Shakeel Akhtar, who has long watched the politics of passion and passion
 It is said that Rahul Gandhi has taken his decision thoughtfully
 rahul gandhi jis tarah kii adarshavaadi or mulyon par aadhaarit raajnneeti karnaa chaahate hai, usamen vah sirf jeetna hi nahin balki apane adarsh or mulyon ko sthapit karnaa chaahate hai
 This was the reason that he had taken the step of holding elections to implement democratic system in his student and youth organization, which was opposed within the party
 iske baavjood unhone ise kaayam rakhaa or party ko iskaa khamiyaja bhugatna padaa
 The result was that the Youth Congress did not show the same vigor and passion
 indira gandhi jab 1977 main chunaav haarin thim to desh bhar ke congressi sadak par utar aae the or naare laga rahe the ki 'aadhi roti khaaenge indira ko waapas laaenge', lekin is baar loksabhaa chunaav ke haar ke 40 din baad jab congressi dharne par baithe to unki sankhya bahut kam thi
 This seems to have dealt a major blow to Rahul Gandhi, after which he made his resignation public
 shakeel akhtar kehete hai ki congress adhyaksh pad chhodkar rahul gandhi kaaphi bada risk le rahe hai
 It is difficult to say what role Rahul will play in politics now
 wo adhyaksh pad par dobaaraa lautenge yaa nahin ise kaha nahin ja saktaa he
 Although the time of five years is very long, we feel that after two and a half years Priyanka Gandhi will take charge of the party, because she has been active since the defeat
 vah kehete hai ki rahul gandhi bahut zyada libral rahe hai, isi kaa nateeja he ki congressi unke baton ko tavajjo nahin dete the
 Indira Gandhi replaced three Chief Ministers in five years, but Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi allowed Sheila Dixit in Delhi and Tarun Gogai in Assam to remain Chief Ministers for 15 years
 iskaa khamiyaja kya hua vah saamne he
 At the same time, BJP and Narendra Modi make someone something, then political motive is hidden behind it
 shakeel akhtar kehete hai ki congress ke nae adhyaksh ke chunaav ke liye kai chijen dekhni hongi
 Along with loyalty to the Gandhi family, youth and socio-caste equations have to be taken care of, otherwise the condition and direction of the Congress will get worse
 gandhi parivaar ke baahar kaa adhyaksh nahin sambhaal paaya partivarisht patrkaar arvind singh kehete hai ki rahul gandhi ko aise daur main congress adhyaksh pad se istipha nahin dena chahie tha
 The Congress may have lost the Lok Sabha elections under Rahul's leadership, but in 2009, under his leadership, the party has managed to win 22 seats in UP and the Congress came to power in three states last year
 is tarah se rahul ek sarvamaanya netaa ke taur par sthapit ho gaye the
 He says that the Congress president who has been outside the Gandhi family in the last thirty years, has not been able to handle the party
 narsimha raav ke daur main narayan dutt tiwari jaise congress ke diggaj netaa ne party se baghawat kar alag party bana lee thi, jo baad main sonia gandhi ke daur main waapas laute
 Apart from this, the way there is factionalism between leaders and workers in the party, only a member of the Gandhi family can keep it
 haalanki rahul gandhi ke congress adhyaksh nahin rahane ke baad bhi maas leader ke taur par unki ahmiyat rahegi
 Senior journalist Rashid Kidwai said that Rahul Gandhi had no other option but to resign
 'gandhi parivaar' ke sivaa party ke baaki netaa mehnat nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 The leaders involved in the Congress CWC can be seen
 jabaki duusari partiyon main netaa se lekar kaaryakarta tak sangharsh karte najar aate hai
 This is the reason why Rahul Gandhi has given a clear indication with his decision that in such a situation the election cannot be won, if the party has to win then everyone has to work hard
 1989 ke baad gandhi parivaar kaa koi bhi sadsy jis prakaar pradhanmantri nahin bana he, usee tarj par ab congress sanghathan ko gandhi parivaar se mukt rakhane kaa kadam uthaaya ja rahaa he
 At the same time, senior journalist Umakant Lakheda says that Rahul Gandhi understands the fact that the condition of the Congress is in the state, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah's system cannot be confronted without changing its character, character and face
 isi maddenjar unhone adhyaksh pad se istipha diya he
 In fact, there are many mandarish leaders in the Congress, due to which Rahul Gandhi could not implement his decisions in the party
 ab rahul gandhi ne istipha dekar ek tir se kai nishane saadhe hai
 Through this, Rahul Gandhi will work to break the shackles of different power centers in the Congress as well as to break the bjp's narrative
 rising pune superjoint ke washington sundar ne ravivaar ko ipel ke final main mumbai india ke khilaaf match main utarate hi record book main naam darj kara liya
 The final match of the IPL is being played at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium in Hyderabad
 isse pehle, sundar ne mumbai ke khilaaf qualifire 1 main bhi kamaal kiya tha
 In this match, Sundar took three wickets for 16 runs and due to this performance, Pune defeated Mumbai by 20 runs to make it to the finals
 baharhaal, final match main washington sundar kaa record alag hi tarah kaa tha
 Sundar is the youngest player to play in the final of the IPL
 washington kii umr 17 varsh 228 din he
 Washington Sundar does not turn his balls too much
 ve gendon ko zyada flite bhi nahin karte lekin apni sateek gendbaaji se ve ballebaaji kii kathin pariksha lene main safal hote hai
 In IPL 10, Washington Sundar played 11 matches including the final for the Pune team
 unase pehle yah record rabindra jadeja ke naam par tha
 In 2008, when Jadeja went to play the final for Rajasthan Royals team, his age was 19 years 178 days
 isi tarah manish pandey jab 2009 main ipel final main utre to unki umr 19 varsh 256 din thi
 Similarly, when Mayank Agarwal played the final in 2011, he was 20 years and 101 days old

 landan main rahane vaale okari ne 2009 main twitor par ek din main kavita kii ek pankti likhakar ek nayaa prayog shuru kiya tha
 He first posted the poem 'I Sing a New Freedom' on Twitter
 iske baad unhone do or kavitaayen post kin
 In 2012, the three poems came out as a collection of poems called 'wild'
 okari ne kaha ‘iske baad mujhe laga ki ab bahut ho gaya
 This medium was very limited because you could not write complex styles on it
 ’ The faith in which people have faith in religion and faith in our country
 usee shiddat se dharm or aadhyatm kii aad main farzi baabaaon kii jamaat logon kii aasthaaon ke saath khel rahi he
 There is no dearth of such gurghuntals in our country
 ek dhundie hazaar milenge or ab isi fehrist main ek or nae baba shaamil ho gaye hai
 Mahamandaleshwar Swami Jyotigiri Maharaj aka IAS Baba
 ye baba bhi babagiri kii dukaan khol kar logon kii aasthaa se khel rahe the
 But one day suddenly Baba's real face went viral on social media
 to lijie bhakthi ke bazaar main aapke peshey khidamat he ek bilkul nae baba
 The name is Mahamandaleshwar Swami Jyotigiri Maharaj
 itnaa baari bharkam naam sunne main aisa lagata he maano dharti ke uddhaar ke liye hi avatarit hue hai
 Sea of compassion
 gyaan ke bhandar
 Destroyer of sins and sinners
 matlab sab kuch inke baayen haath kaa khel hoga
 But do not go in the name of Baba Baba
 naam par jaaenge to kanfus ho jaaenge
 These Baba of Gurugram appear as big as their names
 utane hi bavaali bhi hai
 Watch the video of Baba's compassion and attachment on social media has gone viral
 jisamen baba apni sadhviyon ke saath ashleel harakatein karte hue darj ho gaye hai
 But now their honeymoon period is over
 inaki bhi pole khul chuki he
 Thankfully, Baba had prepared a back-up plan and Baba left before the devotees could climb
 varanaa ye bhi abhi kisi zile kii karagaar kii shobhaa badha rahe hote
 However, the actions of Mahamandaleshwar Swami Jyotigiri Maharaj are exactly the same as those of the Babas before him
 jo philhal jail kii shobhaa badha rahe hai
 The ashram opened in the name of social service
 bhakthi kii shakti dikhaai
 Then under the guise of the same devotion, women started sexually exploiting the sadhus
 or jab pakade jane kaa dar sataaya to boria bistar baandhakar nikal liye
 We are not coming to any conclusion about Baba
 lekin soshal media par jaise inke videos viral hai
 And they themselves are locked in the ashram and are missing
 usase kam se kam aisa to kaha hi ja saktaa he or baba ke karnaamon kii gavaahi ek peedit sadhvi de rahi hai
 An anonymous woman posted a text video on social media accusing Baba and then put some videos on it
 jiskaa labboluab kuch is tarah he
 In a viral post on social media, the anonymous woman says, 'jyotigiri Maharaj forcibly made relations with me
 jyotigiri maharaj saikadon naaballig bacchiyon ke saath yon shoshan kar chukaa he
 i am willing to complain against Baba with at least ten to twelve girls
 lekin baba bahut taaqatvar he or meri jaan ko khatra he
 The woman also claimed in the post that she has 600 hours of videos of Jyotigiri Maharaj in which he is seen sexually abusing minor girls
 
 Moreover, this woman has opened the entire raw letter of Jyoti Giri Maharaj in her post
 
 Also this anonymous woman has written in her post
 soshal media par viral post main gumnaam mahila kahati he 'main abhi saamne nahin aa rahi hum
 Because i know that Jyoti Giri is a very vicious and dangerous devil
 thodaa sa bhi shaq hote hi wo mujhe jaan se marava degaa
 i want to hold it red-handed
 or jab ye police kii hiraasat main hoga to main or bahut si ladkiyaan adaalat main iske khilaaf gavaahi dene ke liye le aauungi
 i have a 600-hour video with 11 women from Jyoti Giri
 jinamein se main kuch clip bhej rahi hum
 Sending the entire video to some news channels and putting it on youtube
 video lambii hone kii vajah se thodaa vakt lag rahaa he
 But i will also send their link to all of you
 aap sabhi se anurodh he ki agar jyoti giri meri hatya karvaa de to ise iske anjaam tak pahunchaana
 According to the news, the police have already registered a case against Baba
 lekin jis gumnaam mahila ne soshal media par ye video daalaa
 a case has also been registered against the woman under Section 509 of the IPC with the IT Act
 kyonki maamla duusari mahila kii privesi se bhi judaa he
 Mohammed Nasheed, the democratically elected first president in the Maldives, resigned from his post on Tuesday following a police coup after several weeks of political turmoil

 An official of the President's office called the unrest an attempt to overthrow former President Mamnoon Abdul Gayoom

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday and informed the Prime Minister about the flood situation in Bihar
 nitish kumaar kaa kahana tha ki bihar main har saal baadh se tabhi bachaa ja saktaa he jab ganga ke talachat kii safai kii jaae
 He said that this is the only way to avoid floods
 pradhanmantri se apni aadha ghante kii mulaakaat mennithish kumaraka kahana tha ki bihar main bane in halaaton kaa jayja lene ke liye visheshgyon kii ek team bhejnaa chahie
 The Prime Minister assured Nitish Kumar of all possible help from the Center
 piem ne kaha ki centre kii ore se harsambhav madad di jaaegi
 Speaking to the media after meeting the Prime Minister, Nitish Kumar said, 'I told the Prime Minister about the flood situation in some districts of Bihar and told him that the flood situation in Bihar has never happened before
 aisi sthiti se tabhi bachaa ja saktaa he, jab talachat kii safai ho'
 Nitish Kumar believes that to tackle such a situation, a national strategy is needed
 media se baat karte hue nitish kumaar kaa kahana tha jo bihar main ganga kii haalat he us par rone kaa man karata he
 Nitish Kumar said to the Prime Minister, which is the Namami Gange project of the central government, if it is not taken care of in time, then it will be questioned, because the condition of Ganga in the state is not good
 gauratlab he ki bihar main baadh ne baari tabaahi machaai he
 About 5 lakh people have been affected in 20 districts, out of which houses of about 2 lakh people were submerged in floods and agriculture has also been damaged
 ganatantr diwas par baraak obama ko bulaane ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pehla telephone myanmar or australia ke liye ravaanaa hone ke thik pehle kiya tha
 By that time the idea had not been adequately consulted but Modi did not want to lose time and he even mentioned it during talks between the two leaders at the end of the deadlock over the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA)
 is par america raashtrapati ne gahari dilchaspee dikhaai lekin jawaab dene ke liye thodaa samay maanga
 This attitude was completely different from his government's first few months when there was a fierce debate over whether Modi should travel to the US in September due to the controversial background of the visa issue
 pradhanmantri ne na sirf vahaan kaa daura kiya balki sambandhon ko ek nai oonchai tak pahunchane kaa iraadaa bhi jaahir kiya
 During this visit, Modi assured Obama that India would not be an obstacle in the way of the trade facilitation agreement at the World Trade Organization meeting and then the agreement was soon agreed with the US abandoning the stipulated deadline
 is tarah nai pi to main purvi asia shikhar sammelan main dinar ke dauraan obama modi ke paas ja pahunche or unhen gale lagaaya or ‘‘main of acshan’’ bataaya
 But there was no talk on the invitation of Republic Day
 brisben main ji-20 shikhar sammelan ke anaupchaarik maahaul main modi ne phir iskaa zikr ched diya
 This opportunity came during a conversation between Modi and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott
 baatcheet shahari vaastukar or yojanakaar walter berli griffin ke bare main ho rahi thi jinhone canberra shahar kaa nirmaan or lakhanu kii angreji raaj ke daur kii tamaam imaaraton kaa dizin banaaya tha, jisamen lakhanu uniwarsity kii shandaar imaarat bhi shaamil he
 Modi joined Obama in the conversation by mentioning that Griffin was born in Chicago, and according to insiders, Abbott was left shocked when the Prime Minister reminded Obama of his invitation again
 obama kaa rukh sakaaratmak tha or america adhikariyon ne baad main bataaya ki unhen bas yahi dekhnaa tha ki kaarykram kaa state of da union bhaashan ke saath koi takaraav na ho
 Approval was received after Modi reached Delhi and then a formal invitation was sent soon
 yah baat kam hi log jaanate hai ki brisben baithak ke purv jab adhikari unhen brif kar rahe the to modi ne griffin ke chicago sambandh ko tad liya tha
 He even went as far as to say that he could use it to start a dialogue with Obama
 jaahir he, modi ke dimag main america chaaya hua tha or uske jaij kaaran bhi hai
 For example, a strong relationship with the US has such a positive impact in the global economic world that it becomes easier to do business with other powerful countries such as Germany, Japan and even Australia
 itnaa hi nahin, yah rishta duniya bhar ke niveshkon ke faislon par asar daalata he jo modi ke aarthik agenda ke liye atyant mahatvapurn he
 Apart from the economic aspect, the US will also be important for dealing with Modi's other problems, especially Pakistan
 unki sarkaar ne ab tak pakistan par jaisi sakht niti apanaai he, use dekhte hue nai dilli ke liye yah munasib nahin hoga ki washington doharaa ravaiya akhriyaar kare, khaskar kisi aatanki hamale kii dasha main yaa kashmir mudde par
 Even a slight lack of warmth in indo-us relations can easily bring Washington to its old ways on these issues
 yahi baat china par bhi lagu hoti he, khaskar tab jab baat duniya ke manch par sahyog kii ho
 It is true that Beijing has shown a way by entering into a bilateral agreement with the US on climate change
 is samjhaute main vah 2030 ko apana charam utsarjan varsh maanane par raji ho gaya he or is tarah usne upie kii bade basic (brazil, dakshin africa, bharat or china) ranneeti ko chhod diya he
 Now India too has to enter into an agreement and it may also agree to set targets soon by reducing the growth rate of the thermal component in its energy production
 aise lakshyon ko puraa karne kaa ek tarika gaiyr-paramparaagat urja kii hissedari badhanaa hoga or yah kadam asainya parmaanu urja ko phir se rajnatik manch ke centre main le aayega
 Modi's ability to get relief on the nuclear liability issue will be a milestone in relations with the US
 is tarah ek tir se teen ahm nishane sadhenge
 One, the profile of indo-us relations will increase
 duusare, modi sarkaar main niveshkon kaa bharosa majboot hoga, or china kii tarah bharat ko bhi jalwaayu parivartan par ek sahyogi banane kaa mauka milegaa
 For America, Modi is offering him a chance to return to the game in Asia
 yah tab jabaki uski ‘‘asia dhuree’’ kii niti apekshit nattejey dene main naakaam rahi he
 Defense Minister Chuck Hagel's resignation from his post and the dull voice of this strategy among the important members of ASEAN are a symbol of this
 obama se munh mode khadi unki gharelu lokapriyata ke chalate is ranneetik kadam se kai sambhaavnaaen paidaa ho sakati hai
 When Bill Clinton toured India in 2000, he was at the lowest point of popularity
 2006 main jorge dablyoo
 Bush, despite his declining popularity, had the Hyde Act approved by the House of Representatives during the last session
 obama kii lokapriyata bhi lagaataar gir rahi he, isse bharat ke ranneetik avasar kamjor kaise ho sakate hai
 Modi, like his predecessors, should not miss out on this

 Sin planets corrupt the emotions and the auspicious planets purify the feelings

 It also reinforces the sense of coercion - Mars gives both a sense of cruelty and violence - it also creates a sense of guilt - Mercury also gives a sense of cunning and intellectualism - Jupiter purifies the feelings - but Somewhere the ego also gives up - Venus makes it very emotional - Such people are subjected to emotions
 How does the planet become emotions? - Saturn examines emotions very much
 Sometimes a person is disturbed by feelings and goes into depression - but sometimes overcoming the feelings becomes a saint - Rahu corrupts feelings - illusions and hateful feelings arise from this planethow to control your emotions? grass court par hone vaale ekmaatr grand slam tennis toornament wimbledon main shuukravaar ko bharat ke diggaj tennis star liender pes, check ganraajya ke apane jodidar radek stepanek ke saath semifinal mukaable main harkar baahar ho gaye

 In 2012, 19-year-old Namrata Damore was found dead on the railway track
 namrata medical bhartee ghotaale main aaropee thi
 She was in contact with doctor Jagdish Sagar, the leader of the medical recruitment scam
 kya namrata kai raaj ugal sakati thi, ye sawaal isaliye bhi uth rahaa he kyonki uski maut kii gutthi ab bhi nahin sulajhi he
 In 2013, Namrata's family filed a petition in the High Court demanding an inquiry into the death
 hoicourt ne 8 hafton main jaanch kar report dene ko kaha
 The police has not yet submitted these reports
 kuch aise hi sawaal 8 or mauton par uth rahe hai
 The SIT itself believes that some deaths have hindered its investigation
 lekin ye maanane ko taiyaar nahin ki in mauton ke peeche koi khaas pattern he
 The comments esaiti sandigdh mauton main se kai maamalon ko saamaanya maan rahi he
 He argues that when people are under investigation, they can commit suicide due to stress or fear
 aise kai record estf ne esaiti ko saunpe hai jinase ye saaf hota he ki kai logon ke naam jaanch ke dauraan aae, unki exiaar darj hone se pehle hi maut ho chuki he
 a big question is arising whether the names of select dead people are being taken to mislead the investigation or there are some big ones who are removing some accused from the way for not disclosing their names

 Namrata was an accused in the medical recruitment scam
 wo medical bhartee ghotaale ke sargana doctor jagadish sagar ke sampark main thi
 Whether Namrata could have unleashed many secrets, this question is also arising because his death knot is still not resolved

 The High Court asked for an inquiry after 8 weeks
 police ne ab tak ye report nahin saunpi he
 Some similar questions are arising on 8 more deaths
 esaiti khud maan rahi he ki kuch mauton kii vajah se uski jaanch main rukaawat ai he
 But they are not ready to believe that there is a particular pattern behind these deaths
 tippaniyan The SIT considers many of the suspected deaths as normal
 uskaa tark he ki jab log jaanch ke ghere main hote hai to tanaav yaa dar ke maare khudakushi kar sakate hai
 Many such records have been submitted by the STF to the SIT, which makes it clear that the names of many people came during the investigation, they have died before the FIR was registered
 bada sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya jaanch ko gumraah karne ke liye kuch chuninda mare huye logon ke naam liye ja rahe hai yaa phir kuch bade log hai jo apana naam ujagar na ho iske liye kuch aropiyon ko raste se hataa rahe hai
 In 2013, Namrata's family filed a petition in the High Court demanding an inquiry into the death
 hoicourt ne 8 hafton main jaanch kar report dene ko kaha
 The police has not yet submitted these reports
 kuch aise hi sawaal 8 or mauton par uth rahe hai
 The SIT itself believes that some deaths have hindered its investigation
 lekin ye maanane ko taiyaar nahin ki in mauton ke peeche koi khaas pattern he
 The comments esaiti sandigdh mauton main se kai maamalon ko saamaanya maan rahi he
 He argues that when people are under investigation, they can commit suicide due to stress or fear
 aise kai record estf ne esaiti ko saunpe hai jinase ye saaf hota he ki kai logon ke naam jaanch ke dauraan aae, unki exiaar darj hone se pehle hi maut ho chuki he
 a big question is arising whether the names of select dead people are being taken to mislead the investigation or there are some big ones who are removing some accused from the way for not disclosing their names

 dilli ke ek doctor kii aaleeshaan audi car se ek rose achaanak haadasa ho jaataa he
 His car crushes four people
 chaaron maukey par hi maare jate hai
 After the accident no one gets on the spot
 naa doctor, naa driver or naa hi koi chashmadid
 After this, a person suddenly arrives at the court, telling himself to be the driver of the same doctor
 haadase kii sari jimmedaari apane sir le letaa he
 Felt the case was over
 cese sulajh gaya
 But in reality it was just the beginning of that breakup
 isane kaiyon ke dimag kii chuulhen hilaa kar rakh di hai
 It was the night of 28 September 2002
 mumbai ke bandra ilaake main maujuud ek bekri ke baahar kuch log footpath par so rahe the
 But at midnight, the film star Salman Khan's high-speed toyota land cruiser passed through the pavement in such a way that it took a man's life in one stroke
 chaar logon ko hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye laachaar kar diya
 The world knows that the car belonged to Salman Khan
 lekin ek wo din tha or ek aaj kaa din
 Even after 14 years, it is a secret that at the time of the accident, who was the driver of that land cruiser of Salman? Now let us bring you directly in 2017 from 2002
 tab jagah mumbai thi
 This time it is Indirapuram of UP, close to Delhi
 yahaan bhi 27 janvari 2017 kii raat ek audi kyuu seven esayuvi or ek auto kii aamane-saamne kii takkar hoti he
 In this accident, four people die in one stroke
 ye car ek doctor kii he, jo haadase ke vaqt usee car main maujuud the
 But just like Salman's car here, even after passing the accident for a full 10 days, it still remains a puzzle as to who was the last driver? a person named Isaac, who lives in Bareilly, just two days after the accident himself Surrendered in Ghaziabad court stating that the driver of the doctor's Audi car
 jamaanat bhi hasil kar lee
 Even so, the story was straightforward, but exactly five days later, another person living at the same address claimed that he had never seen an Audi car from inside
 ye maamla buree tarah ulajh gaya
 This man said that he is neither the driver of that Audi nor he has surrendered any bail in the court
 usne naa sirf ye daawa kiya balki apane is daawey ke haq main subut bhi pesh kar die
 He said that he went to Ahmedabad with a truck away from Delhi every day
 ab ye maamla puri tarah ulajh chukaa tha
 Along with this, many questions were also raised
 sawaal ye ki akhir haadase ke baad khud ko ishak ahamed bataate hue court main sarender karanevaala shaks koun tha? court se jamaanat milte hi akhir wo kahaan gaayab ho gaya? yadi wo vaaki ishak nahin tha, to usne ishak ban kar court or kanoon ko gumraah karne kii koshish kyon kii gai?zaahir he, in sawaalon ke jawaab main hi philhal audi ke is pechida accident kii puri kahani chuphi he
 But before looking for those answers, let us also introduce you to the owner of that Audi Q7, who was present in the same car at the time of the accident
 audi maalik kaa naam dow
 There is Manish Rawat, who is the neuro surgeon of Safdarjung Hospital
 unka kahana he achaanak overtek kii vajah se yah haadasa hua
 The driver fled in fear after the accident
 logon kii bheed teji se jamaa ho gai thi
 The crowd did not consider him the driver, so he went home
 khud ko doctor kii audi kaa driver bataa kar sarender karanevaala shaks ab bhi seen se gaayab he
 On the other hand, Ishaq is refusing to consider himself a driver
 jabaki ishaak ke gharavaale sarender ke is puure khel ke peeche apane hi ek rishtedaar ishtiya kaa naam le rahe hai
 That is, the matter is still completely evasive
 sawaal ye ki kya ishtiya hi ishaak ban kar adaalat kii ankhon main dhul jhonk rahaa tha? agar haa, to kyon? or kiske ishaare par? is maamle main saamne aayaa ek nayaa kirdaar ishtiya
 Did you understand? If not, let us explain
 bareli main rahane vaale ishak ke gharavaale jo daawa kar rahe hai ki unke bete ne kabhi audi car dekhi hi nahin, chalaanaa to dur kii baat he
 They are also claiming that when Audi had an accident in Indirapuram, their son was away from Delhi in Ahmedabad
 lekin baat sirf itani si nahin he
 His family also says that the man who appeared in the court as a driver in the Audi incident as Isaac is none other than his relative Ishtiaq
 ji haa, unheen kaa rishtedaar ishtiya, jisane paison kii laalach main ye sara khel kiya he
 Isaac, along with his relative Ishtiaq, lived in a rented house until some time ago
 unhen shaq he ki unheen dinon main ishtiya ne dhokhe se unke bete ishak kii driving license kii photo copy nikaal lee thi
 By sticking his picture on it, he gave himself the name of Isaac
 audi ke maalik se mil kar khud ko ishak bataate hue adaalat se zamaanat bhi le lee
 The matter opened when the media came to Isaac's house in Bareilly after pleading for the case after revealing Isaac
 ishak or ishtiya ke is pench par audi ke maalik or dilli ke safadarajang aspataal main neurosrjan dow
 Manish Rawat has something else to say
 dow
 Manish is saying that when he hired Isaac, he also got his driving license verified
 tab se vahi shaks ishak ke taur par unki gaadi chalaa rahaa he, jisane ghaziabad court main sarender kiya he
 In such a situation, if he has rigged someone, he can give the same answer
 idhar, mangalvaar ko ajtak ne brijesh naam ke us shaks ko dhundh nikaala
 He was one of Isaac's two sureties in court
 darasal, brijesh ne adaalat main apana aadha-adhuraa pataa diya tha or aise main police sarender karanevaale shaks ke saath brijesh ko bhi dhundh rahi thi
 While talking on the phone, Brijesh said that he did not do anything wrong
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki kya dow
 Manish also knows Ishtiaq by the name of Isaac? And was Ishtiaq still working with him as Isaac? If this is true, then how did Doctor Manish Rawat get his fake driving license verified? ek koching nagarike rup main deshbhar main apni pahchaan bana chukaa kota kashmir main soch ke str par hue bade badlaav kaa sakshi ban rahaa he
 a large number of students from Kashmir Valley, affected by separatism and terrorism, have come to Kota and are taking coaching in coaching institutes here
 kashmir se k reeb 300 se zyada chaatr-chatraayen medical or ejineering kii pravesh parikshaon kii taiyaari ke liye kashmir se saikadon mile dur rajasthan ke shahar kota tak kaa faasla tay kar chuke hai
 You will be seen in some coaching institutes in Kota, a group of these girls, who are head covered in Kashmiri style, whose dialect does not make it difficult to guess which state they come from
 kota ke alan kariyar koching institutes main pard rahi chaatra, anantnag kii 17 varshiya sabara parveen bataati hai, ''mere bhai or bahan bhi ejineering kii padhai kar rahe hai
 i came to Kota so that i could study in the coaching institutes of Kota to prepare for the medical entrance exam and then i could enroll in medical college and become a doctor
 '' sabara ke saath hi unheen kii hamaumr saabia sharif ne bhi chaar maheene pehle daakhila liya he
 She is from Srinagar
 vaadi main balika shiksha ko lekar tang nazariye sambandhi baton ko saabia khaarij karti hai
 In his words, "in fact, Kashmir does not have a professional atmosphere of academic competition like the quota for medical and engineering entrance examinations
" yahi vajah thi, jiske chalate maine kota aane kii thaanee
 But there is no such thing in the plaintiff about any kind of protest against the education of girls
 '' kota ke koching institutes kii jaankaree inhen yahaan se padhakar gaye logon ke rishtedaaron yaa parichiton se mili
 These girls, who are coming to Kota and coaching, have no qualms or hesitation about their education and purpose
 kulgaam kii rahane vaali rukaiya amin kii hi suniye, ''main jammu-kashmir se baahar akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan (ames) jaise kisi nami-giraami medical college main daakhila lenaa chaahati hum or meraa yah khwab kota main koching se hi puraa ho saktaa he
 That is why i have come here
 '' rukaiya ke pita dow

 It is not that all the students of Kashmir want to get out of the state after studying higher studies

 Her father is also a doctor and she wants to serve the women of Kashmir by becoming a gynecologist or obstetrician
 koi khaas vajah? ''asal main vaadi main ginocolgists kii behad kami he
 "even those with good intentions say that she will provide free healthcare to the Kashmiri people after becoming a doctor
" bakaul ulfat, ''main jammu-kashmir ke medical college main daakhile ke liye jammu kashmir ke kaaman entrens test(siiti) main baithungi
 "apart from the girl students, a large number of students are coming from Kashmir
 anantnag se aae raja riyaj bataate hai ki vaadi main rajya str kii pratiyogi parihnaon kii taiyaari ke liye to koching kii suvidhaayen hai lekin unhen chunki rashtriya str kii parikshaon ke liye koching leni thi, isliye unhone kota aane kaa man banaaya
 In the context of all kinds of things about terrorism in the valley, Riyaz says, "it is not right to look at the whole valley from the perspective of terrorism

 It does not have that much effect in cities
 ''is saal ghati ke kareeb 185 chaatr-chatraayen to akele alan kariyar koching institute main hi daakhila le chuke hai
 The director of the institute Naveen Maheshwari calls it an important development
 unheen ke shabdon main, ''yun to kashmir ke chaatr-chaatraon ke kota aakar koching karne kaa silsilaa 5-6 saal pehle shuru hua tha lekin tab ikkaa-dukka chaatr hi aayaa karte the
 For the first time in the 2011-12 academic session, 121 students came from there
 hamaare yahaan pichley saal bhi k reeb 195 chaatr-chaatraon ne daakhila liya tha
 This year, this figure will surpass the last time because the admissions are still going on
 kashmiri chaatr-chaatraon main ucch shiksha ke prati lalak paidaa hui he
 "other institutions are also confirming Maheshwari's words more or less
 rezonence institute institutes ke upaadhyaksh (bijness deveopment or aapareshans) manoj sharma kii raay main, ghati ke chaatr-chatraayen jammu-kashmir se aage nikalakar avasaron kii talash kar rahe hai
 Sharma points to another big aspect here
 unka maananaa he ki shiksha ke prati vaadi main badale is nazariye kaa bada shrey kota aakar koching karne vaale in chaatr-chaatraon ke abhibhavakon ko jaataa he
 This was his decision
 unhen pataa tha ki is ek faisle se unke bacchon kii jindagi badal sakati he
 There are also problems for these students
 ve vaadi ke behad thande or alag bhugolic parivesh se aate hai
 Generally, these youths living in snow-bound plains had to bear temperatures of more than 45 degrees in Kota in may-june
 aise main hostel se koching institutes tak kii chand kadamon kii duuri bhi unhen behad nagavar lagati he
 But still these people have adapted themselves even in adverse circumstances
 saabia bataati hai ki zyaadaatar chatraayen hostel main amuman airkandishand yaa cooler vaale kamaron main rahati hai
 They cover the distance from hostels to institutes by covering their faces with cloth
 maansaahaari bhojan ke aadi in chaatro ko rajasthan ke shaakaahaari bhojan se kaam chalaanaa pad rahaa he
 Non-vegetarian food is not served in hostel mess
 rukaiya bataati hai, ''kota main aakar gatta kii sabji, curry, tinda or lowki or iske alaava poha ekadam nayaa bhojan he
 We are having difficulties in keeping pace with this, but gradually we will get used to it
 ''zyaadaatar, chaatr-chatraayen alpsankhyak samudaay se aate hai, jo padhai ke saath ibaadat bhi karte hai
 In the month of just finished Ramadan, students are going to study in coaching, along with fasting and fasting
 ulfat kii pidaa he ki un logon ke ghar bahut dur hone se ve log jaldi-jaldi ghar bhi nahin ja sakate
 In the month of Ramadan, the pain of staying away from family like this increases even more
 vaise, khaane-peeche or duusari bhugolic pareshaaniyon kii baaten chhod den to ye kashmiri chaatr-chatraayen kota ke logon se mili apanepan ke bhav se bhi khaase prabhavit hai
 Even Sabra says, "I have found a lot of familiarity with my classmates from coaching institutes, hostels and mess and other places
 har koi madad ke liye hameshaa taiyaar rahata he
 "it is important to note that every year more than one lakh students from different parts of the country and abroad also come here for the preparation of medical and engineering entrance examinations in Kota
 is badi sankhya kii tulana main kashmir se aane waalon kii taadaad bhale hi mahaj teen ankon vaali ho lekin koi bhi jaankaar ise vaadi ke logon kii ore se ek badi pahal maan rahe hai
 It can also be a sign of the changing environment of the Kashmir Valley

 The incident occurred in Bhopa village on Wednesday, a video clip of which has gone viral on social media
 news agency IANS ke mutabik, goshaala panchayat dwaara sanchalit kii jaati he
 District Magistrate Selva Kumari had said that a case has been registered against the Sarpanch and the Panchayat Secretary under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act
 kathith taur par laaparvaahee baratane ke liye panchayat sachiv ko bhi nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 With this, the District Magistrate also sent a notice to the sarpanch, in which he was asked why the process of removing him from his post should not be started? aaj raat 19 farvari, 2019 ko chand prithvi ke kaaphi kareeb dikhaai degaa
 This moon will be 14 percent larger in size and 30 percent brighter than the moon seen daily

 Earlier on January 21, a supermoon took place, which did not take place in India
 aaj ke baad 21 march ko poornima (purnima) ke din supermun dikhegaa
 At the same time, this super moon today of February 19 is the nearest supermoon of the year
 itihaas kii dhaaraon ko kya ekajute vam morcha palat saktaa he or congress ke saath haath main haath daalkar chal saktaa he, taaki is saal ke aakhir main hone vaale pashchim bengal ke vidhansabha chunaavon main mamata banerjee kii trinmul congress (tiemasi) ko gaddi se bedakhal kiya ja sake?is saal pashchim bengal or tamilnadu main tathaa 2017 main punjab or uttar pradesh main chunavi loktantr kii paanch salanaa kavayad ke liye manch taiyaar hone ke saath hi, sipiem kii pashchim bengal ikai congress se haath milaane ke liye mutmain dikhaai detii he
 Even more interesting is that the politburo of 16 members, the most powerful decisive body of the party, has split from the middle on the question whether or not to support its West Bengal unit going to seek the help of Congress
 isamen jo log “congress sahit samaan vichaaron vaali secular partiyon” kaa saath lene ke himachati hai, unamem mote taur par vahi log bataae jate hai jinhone april 2015 main vishakhapattanam main party kii 21wein congress main seetaram yechuri ko party mahasachiv banaae jane kaa samarthan kiya tha
 That means Viman Bose, the chairman of the Left Front Committee in Bengal, his trusted aide and the head of the state party Suryakant Mishra, Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar and Raiganj MP Mohammad Salim
 yah mahaj sanyog nahin he ki is dhade ke zyaadaatar log pashchim bengal ke hi hai
 Yechury, recently elected CPM general secretary, admitted the party's weakness in the party's mouthpiece People's Democracy in the last week of 2015
 unhone likhaa tha, “hamaari party kii takat or vishaal sadsyta ke maamle main bhale hi giravat nahin ai ho lekin asmaan banaavat or hamaari chunavi takat main tehraav aa gaya he
 In view of this, the party organization should be strengthened under any circumstances
 ” to kya desh kii sabase badi vampanthi party yah baat kubul rahi he ki “atmalochna” kii laffaaji bhari baton ke aage use madad kii jarurat he?isamen koi shaq nahin ki 2008 main bharat-america parmaanu samjhaute ko lekar manmohan singh kii aguai vaali upie sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene ke baad se yah vam party is kadar deen-hin haalat main or doston ke liye haath failaae hue pehle kabhi nahin thi
 At that time, its command was in the hands of the formidable Prakash Karat, who was intent on plowing the principles, instead of breaking the loaves with those who jammed with the American imperialists, even at the risk of gross loneliness
 lagata he saat saal baad sipiem ko aakhirkaar yah samaj main aa gaya he ki rashtriya raajnneeti main madhya-vam jagah ko kabjane kii uski kshamta kaa sidhaa rishta is baat se he ki vah kitne rajyon main satta main he or sansad main uske kitne saansad hai
 In 2008, the Left Front was blowing air with 62 mps in the Lok Sabha and its governments in three states, West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura
 aaj loksabhaa main uske mahaj nau saansad hai or keval ek rajya tripura ko vah ab bhi apana kah saktaa he
 Kerala lost the Congress-led coalition in mid-2011
 maano yahi beijjati kam na ho, takreeban usee vakt mamata banerjee kii tiemasi ne pashchim bengal unase chin liya
 Out of 294 seats in West Bengal, 227 seats were retained by TMC and the Left Front came down to 62 seats
 vahiin bijepi ne bhi 2014 ke upachunaavon main pashchim bengal main pehla baar ek seat jitkar apana khaataa kholaa
 But there are other members in the Politburo who believe that "nothing has changed" so that there is a need to change the policy set in the Visakhapatnam Party Congress
 vishakhapattanam main sampradayik bijepi or aniatik congress, donon ke saath baraabar duuri banaae rakhane kii niti tay hui thi
 In this faction, former party general secretary Prakash Karat and his wife Brinda Karat, Suhasini Ali, b
 ve
 Raghavulu and veteran Kerala leader Pinarayi Vijayan are included
 ali ne india today se kaha, “vishakhapattanam main party congress kii line judwa buraaiyon yani congress or bijepi se laduya or unase samaan duuri banaae rakhana thi
 Nothing like this has changed, not even the upcoming elections in Bengal, so that any change in the party line can be necessitated
 ” ve bataati hai ki bengal ke logon ne mamata kii sajishon kaa anjaam dekh liya he or ve ek baar phir tiemasi ke khilaaf yojit vam dalon kii reliyon or pradarshnon main badi taadaad main aane lage hai
 a senior Congress leader, realizing the tinge of Karat's 2008 decision so far, pointed to the CPM as a sane fugitive
 congress ke pravaktaa randeep singh surajevaala ne mana ki unki party is behatar sthiti main he, jahaan vam dal or trinmul congress, donon hi use rijhaane main lagi hai
 The interesting thing is that the Congress unit of West Bengal is also not getting ready to join hands with the Left Front
 use lag rahaa he ki agar ve ek aisi party ke saath haath milaate hai, jisane apane jamini kader kaa kuch hissaa ab bhi bachaa rakhaa he, to ve bhi akele ladgaye kii bajaae kahin behatar pradarshan kar sakenge
 However, Mamta's TMC has destroyed many important links of the Left parties from the ground to the urban centers
 asal main congress ke rajya mahasachiv o
 P
 mishra ne haal hi main siton ke bantwaare or ek ailaania saajha nunatam kaarykram kii peshkash karte hue party adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko chitthee likhi thi
 On the other hand, the argument of cpm's West Bengal camp as well as mathematics is straightforward
 2014 ke aam chunaav main desh bhar se gujarata narendra modi kaa kaaravaan apane peeche kai chizon ko nestnabud karke chhod gaya
 The Left Front's vote share dramatically decreased to 29 per cent in 2014, while the Congress 9
 6 fisadi par simat gai
 On the other hand, TMC increased its votes to 39
 40 fisadi par pahunch gai, jabaki bijepi ne rajya bhar main apni pataakaa fahraate hue 17
 Captured 6 percent of the votes
 haalanki prakaash karaat maanate hai ki burjua partiyon kii badtar nakal banane kii bajaae apane jamini kader or yahaan tak ki madhyavarg ke logon ko bhi dobaaraa shikshit or prashikshit karnaa kahin zyada ahm he
 But they also know that this type of alliance has been done before
 2004 main jab congress or sahyogi partiyon ke haathon bijepi kii haroonges haar ne puure bharat ko chaunkaa diya tha, us vakt ke mahasachiv harkishan singh surajeet ne saathi sikh or pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke saath ek saajha nunatam kaarykram kaa tanabana buna tha
 At the party's organizational session in Kolkata in the last week of 2015, when the media asked about the possibility of a left-congress alliance, Karat admitted, "there has always been flexibility
" 
 
 hamaari ranneeti ko lacheela hona hoga taaki ham paidaa hone vaale kisi bhi nae siyaasi halaat ke liye taiyaar rah saken
 "it seems that in 2015, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has replaced Surjeet
 ve 2019 ke aam chunaav par apni nazren gadaaye hai, jisamen ve narendra modi or bijepi ko chunauti dene ke liye ek vishwasaneey gaiyr-bijepi gathbandhan kaa tanabana bunana chaahate hai
 Before that, the Assembly elections in West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh in 2016-17 will be important trials, which will help in deciding the wind direction
 nitish kehete hai ki bihar main jis tarah janata dal (united), rashtriya janata dal or congress ne milakar bijepi virdohi mahagathbandhan banaaya, thik usee tarah ke gathbandhan har us rajya main banaae hi jane chahie jahaan agle ek-dedh saal main chunaav hone vaale hai
 For example, the AIUDF of Congress and Badruddin Ajmal in Assam as well as AGP may reach an agreement
 kehete hai ki nitish ke behtareen rajnatik ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ne is disha main pehle se kaam bhi karnaa shuru kar diya he
 The Congress in Tamil Nadu is expecting an alliance with the DMK
 or pashchim bengal main agar donon hikemaanon ne apni rajya ikaayiyon kii suni, to vam morche or congress ke bich ek samjhauta mumkin ho saktaa he
 It is believed that good and bad aspects of this possibility have been discussed between Yechury and Rahul Gandhi
 cold coffee ke saath in maamalon par charchaa ke liye sansad kaa central haul acchhee jagah he
 But Yechury refused to talk about his party's intentions, saying only that the state unit's words would be "well heard
" ”paulitabeuro ke ek sadsy, jo kerala se hai, kehete hai ki congress ke saath jane main ek dikkat yah he ki unke grih rajya main chunaav bengal ke chunaavon ke saath-saath hi honge
 And here is a direct fight between the Congress-led United Democratic Front and the Left Democratic Front
 sipiem ke ek varisht netaa apane naam kaa khulaasa nahin karne kii shart par kehete hai, “aisa nahin ho saktaa ki bengal main to congress ke saath hamaara samjhauta ho or kerala main vah hamaari siyaasi dushman ho
 There must be some sequence in our political line
 ”jahaan tak tiemasi ke congress ko rijhaane kii baat he, surajevaala ne is baat kii tasdik yaa khandan karne se inkaar kar diya ki mamata or sonia gandhi ke bich is maamle main haal hi main koi baat hui he
 By the way, everyone knows that both women like each other
 congress ke netaa bataate hai ki mamata kabhi josh se bhari congress kaaryakarta hua karti thim
 The only difference is that after that a lot of water has passed from under the bridge and Mamta has fought with BJP on many occasions
 abhi haal hi main 8 janvari ko vitt mantri arun jetali mamata ke pasandida bengal bijness summit main bhaag lene ke liye udakar kolkata gaye the, jabaki sansad main tiemasi ne khuleam kaha ki vah modi ke pasandida jiesti vidheyak ko sadan main paarit karwaane ke liye apana samarthan degi
 Mohammad Salim, who was barred from going there after a communal riot erupted in Kaliachak in Malda district in early January, says, "modi and Didi are dividing people on religious grounds, but we have the longest experience of running an alliance
" Is and we know how to increase our left base
 ” yahi nahin, congress or vam donon netaa jor dekar kehete hai ki sibiai sharada chit fund ghotaale main mamata ke kareebi sahyogiyon se poochtacha karne main deree kar rahi he or yah is baat kaa “saboot” he ki tiemasi netaa bijepi se riyaayaten hasil kar rahe hai or bijepi bhi makul jawaab de rahi he
 Congress leaders say it is "too early" for the party to decide now whether it will compromise with the Left parties or with the TMC
 lekin ve is baat kii tasdik karte hai ki europe main chhuttiyaan bitaane jane se pehle rahul gandhi kii yechuri ke saath mulaakaat hui thi
 However, even if Rahul and Sonia are ready, the question before the Left Front, especially the CPM, is whether or not they allow the West Bengal faction to dominate in terms of electoral strategy
 tis par bhi ve yechuri ke is vishleshan se pallaa nahin jhaad sakate ki vam dalon par kamajoriyon or giravat kii vipadaa aan padi he or use andolan main nai jaan foonkane kii sakht jarurat he
 a CPM leader says, "the party is not able to attract the youth or people from the intellectual class and the middle classes
" ham apni shuddhtavaadi line bhi tabhi banaae rakh sakate hai, jab pehle hamaare paas ek party to ho!”kolkata adhiveshan ke aakhir main 31 disambar ko yechuri ne kaha, “yah baithak apane bheetar jhaankne, manan karne or aage ke kaam ke liye nae sire se shuruyaat karne kaa vakt he
 "but the rest of the party is deeply aware that until the senior party leaders find their differences, it can fight its ideological anti-bjp half-heartedly
 sawaal yah he&kya vam takatein jamini hakeekat se samjhauta karne ko taiyaar hai? iskaa jawaab siyaasi mukaable par kaaphi fark daal saktaa he, kam se kam pashchim bengal ke ahm chunaavon main to jarur
 Considering its rebel leader BS Yeddyurappa's exit from the party soon, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday discussed its possible consequences and decided that disciplinary action will be taken against those who violate party discipline
 
 agle varsh hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye party kii taiyaariyon ko lekar din bhar chali baithak main adhiktar netaaon ne yediurppa ke kshetreey party banane or bijepi par iske prabhaav par chintaa jaahir kii

 According to BJP sources, the party is considering taking disciplinary action against some Yeddyurappa loyalists
 isse pehle ishwarappa ne yediurppa ke daawey ko khaarij kar diya ki shettar sarkaar bijepi kegepi (karnataka janata party) kaa gathbandhan he or kaha ki yah bijepi sarkaar he

 Pinaki Mishra said that the Biju Janata Dal is against the NRC and the NRC is more likely to harm a certain class of people

 Pinaki Mishra said that if NRC is implemented, he will not be able to prove his citizenship himself, as he does not have a birth certificate
 pinaki mishra ne kaha ki NRC ke khilaaf unki party kaa stand saaf he or unki party NRC kaa samarthan nahin kar sakati he

 chitrangada ne bataaya ki maine film ke liye guitar bajaanaa siikhaa
 Although i only learned for 20 days
 or mujhe nahin lagata ki main abhi thik se guitar baja sakati hum

 The BJP also reduced the climax in announcing the names of candidates for the MCD elections
 emsidi chunaavon ke liye somvaar ko namakan daakhil karne kaa aakhri din tha, lekin bijepi ke ummidavaaron kii aakhri list namakan kaa vakt khatm hone se mahaj teen ghante pehle ai

 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki notebandi or jiesti ne emsamai ke nakad pravaah ko barbaad kar diya or anaupchaarik kshetra main kaam karne vaale lakhon log berozegaar ho gaye
 a large number of people working in small businesses were forced to return to their villages
 isse log kaaphi naaraaz hai
 Everything we hear about lynching is the result of this
 maaloom ho ki rahul gandhi germany ke daure par hai
 The purpose of his visit is to communicate with the students living there and the people of the Indian community

 padhie germany main kya-kya bole rahul gandhi> ek sawaal ke jawaab main rahul gandhi ne kaha ki agar bharat main ham sabhi logon ko rojgaar de pate hai, to jansankhya apane aap main koi samasya nahin he
 > On the question of giving equal rights to women, the Congress President said that when i look at Parliament and political parties, there are very few women representatives
 ham mahila aarakshan ke liye vidheyak lekar aae hai, lekin ye puri tarah se saamaajik mudda he
 If we do not include women, we cannot build the country
 bhartiya purushon ko mahilaon ko apane baraabar dekhnaa hoga
 > During the question-and-answer session, a listener expressed his desire to hug Rahul Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi reluctantly called him on stage and hugged him
 rahul gandhi se gale milane vaale yah shaks mul rup se punjab kaa rahane vaala he
 He also praised Rahul Gandhi's embrace of PM Modi in Parliament

 com / wzpj5fwoz9— Congress (@incindia)august 22, 2018>ek sawaal ke jawaab main rahul gandhi ne kaha ki agar china se pratispardhaa kerani he, to bharat ko chote or madhyam bijness ko protsaahit karnaa hoga
 > In response to a question, Rahul Gandhi said that India has important strategic relations with America and we share some ideas like democracy with them
 haalanki bharat is baat ko nazarandaaj nahin kar saktaa he ki china teji se aage bad rahaa he or vah bhavishya main prabhavi bhoomika nibhaayega
 In such a situation, India will have to strike a balance between the two countries
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki isko santulit karne main bharat or europe kii bhoomika hogi
 > Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that there is no competition between China and India
 ho saktaa he ki china bharat kii tulana main tezi se bad rahaa ho, lekin yah myne nahin rakhata he
 At the same time, people in India can express what they want and that is what matters
 >ek sawaal ke jawaab main rahul gandhi ne kaha ki saal 1991 main mere pita ko aatankwaadi ne maar daalaa tha
 When i saw the killer of my father lying dead in Sri Lanka, i did not like it
 maine usamen uske rote hue bacchon ko dekha
 The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) chief v Prabhakaran was responsible for the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi
 use srilankai sainikon ne 2009 main maar giraaya tha
 > Rahul Gandhi said that i have faced violence and i can tell you that the only way to get out of this - to forgive and forgive you have to understand where it is coming from?> Embracing Modi Rahul Gandhi said that i have lovingly responded to the hate by hugging him
 is dauraan unhone kaha ki sirf bharat hi nahin, balki puri duniya main logon ko nafrat kii bajaay charchaa kerani chahie
 On the question of spreading hate speech and doing politics, Rahul Gandhi said that the meaning of Indian is non-violent
 >piem modi ko gale lagane ke sawaal par rahul gandhi ne kaha, 'ahimsa bharat kaa darshan he or bhartiya hone kaa saar he
 PM Modi is making hate comments against me
 maine unke prati sneh dikhaaya
 However, some members of my party did not like the move to embrace Modi
 main is par unase asahmat hum
 '> Rahul Gandhi said that if you don't embrace people and don't give them any vision, then someone else will do it and maybe that idea may not be good for you
 aapas main judi duniya main aapako sunanaa hoga ki duusare kya kah rahe hai or ve kahaan se aa rahe hai
 i can fight and disagree with a person, but hate is a dangerous thing
 > rahul gandhi ne kaha ki agar bharat ko is jokhim bhare badlaav se guzaranaa padaa, to ham chaahate the ki sabhi samudaayon or bhashaaon ko is badlaav main shaamil kiya jaae
 > Employment Guarantee Scheme, Right to Food, Right to Information, Nationalization of Banks These were some of the ideas that all governments want to do, but now these ideas are largely destroyed
 daliton, alpsankhyakon or adivaasiyon ko ab sarkaar se koi phayda nahin miltaa he
 The money of all the schemes that benefit them is going to a few big corporate
 > piem modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue rahul gandhi ne kaha ki kuch saal pehle pradhanmantri modi ne bhartiya arthvyavastha main notebandi kaa faisla kiya or emsamai ke nakad pravaah ko barbaad kar diya, anaupchaarik kshetra main kaam karne vaale lakhon log berozegaar ho gaye
 a large number of people working in small businesses were forced to return to their villages
 isse log kaaphi naaraaz hai
 Everything we hear about lynching is the result of this
 > unhone kaha ki bharat main dhire-dhire badlaav shuru hua
 This change was eliminating caste-based thinking and promoting the idea of 'one person, one vote'
 > congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha ki bharat main koi kahin par ja saktaa he, lekin china main koun kahaan jayega, iskaa faisla vahaan kii communist sarkaar karti he
 There are different cultures, languages and religions in our country
 bharat gaanv ko desh hai, jo badal rahaa he
 People from the lower classes are affected the most in this change
 aise main unako sahyog karne kii jarurat hoti he
 In India, 100 days of employment were guaranteed to the people through MNREGA
