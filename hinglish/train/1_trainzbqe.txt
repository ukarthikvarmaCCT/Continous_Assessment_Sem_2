 Iran on Sunday announced a successful test run of a long-range firepower missile manufactured in the country, saying it could be guided with precision to hit the target
 raksha mantralay ne apni website par 'imaad' missile pareekshan kii tasviren post kii he, lekin adhiktam duuri or anya kshamtaaon kaa vivaran nahin diya gaya he
 The comments raksha mantri hossain deghan ke hawaale se bataaya gaya he, yah iran kii lambii duuri tak maar karne vaali pehali missile he, jo lakshya bhedane tak nirdeshit or niyantrit kii ja sakati he
 The test comes at a time when a few months ago some Iranian officials expressed concern over the Islamic Republic's recent agreement with world powers that it may limit the capability of its missile program
 parmaanu hathiyaar le jane main sakasham missile viksit karne se iran par pratibandh lagane vaale samjhaute ke kuch din baad sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad prastaav manjuur kiya gaya tha
 Deghan said, "we do not need permission from anyone to strengthen our defense and missile capability
" ' iran ne kaha he ki uski misile parmaanu aayudh nahin le jaaegi, kyonki parmaanu hathiyaar viksit karne kii uski yojana nahin he, lekin sainya adhikariyon kaa jor desh ke missile kaarykram ke vistaar par he
 It is the first Iranian long-range missile to be guided and controlled until it hits a target, Defense Minister Hussein Deghan has been quoted as saying
 yah pareekshan aise samay main hua he, jab kuch maheene pehle kuch irani adhikariyon ne vishwa shaktiyon ke saath islamic ganraajya ke haalia samjhaute ke prati chintaa jataai thi ki isse uske missile kaarykram kii kshamta simit ho sakati he
 a UN Security Council resolution was approved a few days after the agreement banning Iran from developing a missile capable of carrying nuclear weapons
 deghan ne kaha, 'hamen apni raksha or missile kshamta ko majboot karne ke liye kisi se ijaajat lene kii jarurat nahin he
 Iran has said that its missiles will not carry nuclear armaments, as it does not plan to develop nuclear weapons, but military officials are focused on expanding the country's missile program

 He termed the BJP rally held in Malda as a mini brigade which has fielded against Mamta

 You saw the names of the three cricketers involved in the fixing trap but the fixing story does not end there, more names are yet to come
 abhi or bhi chaunkaane vaale khulaase hone baaqi hai
 The decision to win and win has been decided in the IPL but between the gap of defeat and victory, it is not known how many times cricket has been lost
 pataa nahin kis-kis ne or kitni baar cricket ko kalankit karne kii koshish kii he
 All the faces are going to come out one by one
 abtak cricket ko sharmasaar karne vaale teen chehre saamne aae hai lekin agar aap ye soch kar khud ko tasalli de rahe hai ki phixing inhen teen khilaadiyon tak simat gayi he, to ek bade jatke ko taiyaar ho jaaiye
 Control cricket, control greed, no one knows how many times in IPL-6, how many matches you have been cheated on, you might not have even thought about which ball was sold by which player
 match dekhte hue jis chakke par aapane tali bajaayi hogi, jin chaukon par aap vaah-vaah kar baithe honge
 It is not known whether he was the result of the batsman's ability or the bowler's sold conscience
 IPL kii 5 team ke 6 khilaadiyon par dilli police kii najarafixing kii tah tak pahunchane kii koshish main juty dilli police ke radar par hai 6 or khilaadi
 Delhi Police is eyeing 6 players from 5 teams of IPL
 chand paison kii khatir apana imaan bechney vaale in khilaadiyon kii maujuudagi har tarah kii tiimon main he, champion se lekar chitt hui tiimon tak
 The team in Mumbai was the insider, the bowler involved in fixing! If sources of Delhi Police are to be believed then this joy of Mumbai's victory in the next few days is also going to be eclipsed
 is team main bhi ek bhediya he, is team main bhi ek aisa gendbaaj he jisane chand paison kii khatir apane imaan se samjhauta kiya he, jisane apni chook se nahin balki paison ke liye ran pitwaaye
 Fraud of Royal Challengers fans, team's 2 bowlers sold out! Regrets fans of Royal Challengers will also get to know that if there are no two spies in their team then maybe they are also in the last four teams to compete for the cup Could make a place
 pataa nahin koun se match main wo ran baari pade jisamen us gendbaaj ne paison kii khatir apni cricket kaa sauda kiya tha
 Fans of Rajasthan Royals team, who have made a place in another fixerplayoff in Rajasthan team, are going to be shocked
 pehle se giraftaar teen khilaadiyon ne vaise team kii mitti paleed kar di thi
 Now the act of another bowler is going to shock this team
 kings ilevan ke gendbaaj par bhi shakkings ilevan punjab, behtareen khilaadiyon kii maujuudagi ke baavjood ye team acha nahin kar saki
 It is reported that this team also has a bowler who has scored runs for money
 jisane karodon cricket phans ke bharose kaa sauda kiya he
 How did the Delhi team, which also trailed in the IPL of the last time, betrayed the Delhi team, this time it was in the last place
 naa kisi kii balla chal paaya or naa hi kisi kii gendbaaji main wo dhar dikhi
 Big cricket experts were confused about why this is happening
 agle chand dinon main hone vaale dilli police ke khulaase se dilli kii team kaa bhi wo devil najar aa jayega
 If sources are to be believed, among the batsmen who have sold their conscience, he is the only batsman who does not know how many times he has struck fours off his bat
 saare raaj dilli police jald hi fash karne vaali he
 Those players also intend to deliver them behind bars
 abhi ham in khilaadiyon kaa naam nahin bataa rahe kyonki dilli police ko talash he us ek kadi kaa jisaki giraftaar se in khilaadiyon ke khilaaf mili saboot pukhta ho jaaenge
 This is the link that was the biggest contact between the bookie and the players
 dilli police kii jaanch ko nuksaan naa pahunche isliye ham is kadi ko bhi aapke saamne benakaab nahin kar rahe
 Apart from these, Delhi Police is looking for two more bookies
 sanjay agarwal urf sanjay jaipur or aamir
 These are the people whose arrests will reveal the entire design of the underworld fixing
 kahaan se kaise paise or kis kis tak paise pahunche saare raaj khulne lagenge

 Did Sunanda Pushkar commit suicide or a mistake became the reason for her death? The post-mortem report from which the mystery of Sunanda's death was to be solved, has become more complicated after the same report came out
 postmortem report kahati he ki sunanda kii maut dawa ke overdoj se hui
 That is, Sunanda ate more medicine together and the same drug became poison in the stomach, but the question is whether the overdose of the drug was deliberate or inadvertent? What is in the post-mortem report of Sunanda Pushkar
 
 
 sunanda kii postmortem kii shuruaati report saamne aa gai he
 The cause of death also became almost clear
 par maut kii paheli ab bhi apni jagah kaayam he
 This question is still in its place whether Sunanda's death will be called suicide or accidental death? AIIMS Head Medical Board Dr
 Sudhir Gupta submitted the post-mortem report of Sunanda in a sealed envelope to Alok Sharma, Vasant Vihar's SDM on Monday evening
 vasant vihaar ke esadm alok sharma hi sunanda kii sandigdh maut kii jaanch kar rahe hai, sutron ke mutabik shuruaati postmortem report main maut kii vajah drugs ke overdoj ko bataai gai
 The report said that due to an overdose, the drug became poisonous in the stomach and Sunanda died due to the same
 postmortem report main sunanda ke sharir par chot ke kai nishaanon kaa bhi zikr he, lekin report ke mutabik jakhm ke in nishaanon kaa sunanda kii maut se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Sources say that it has become clear from the post-mortem report that Sunanda had neither eaten the poison nor been murdered
 par report main ye nahin bataaya gaya he ki drugs kaa overdoj sunanda ne jaanboojh kar liya tha yaa phir anjaane main? or inhen chizon ne maut kii paheli ko or ulajhaa diya he
 Actually, in which food will this death be kept or what sections of the law will be imposed on this death, it will be decided only when it will be clear that under which circumstances Sunanda took an overdose of drugs? With the intention of committing suicide or inadvertently? What is the opinion of the expert? 
 
 vaise export kii maane to aamtaur par dawa ke aadi marijon ko itnaa pataa hota he ki koun si dawa kitni khaani chahie or kitni maatra main
 Sunanda was educated and since she was also being treated, she was addicted to food
 depressant kii dawa tay maatra se zyada ek saath lene kaa anjaam kya hota he ye wo acchhee tarah jaanati thim
 In such a situation, the question arises that then inadvertently she could have taken such a quantity of lethal drugs together? What happened in room number 345 of Leela Hotel
 
 
 sutron ke mutabik lila hotel ke cameraa number 345 se sunanda kii maut ke baad talaashi main bahut sari davaaiyaan mili thim
 Two strips of depression medicine were also found from them
 ek strip main 15 goliyaan aati hai
 Police found an empty strip from the room while the other strip of medicine found only three bullets
 yani tees goliyon kii in do strips main se 27 goliyon kaa istemaal kiya ja chukaa tha par ye saaf nahin ho paaya he ki kya 27 goliyaan ek saath khai gayi yaa phir kai dinon main inkaa istemaal hua?vaise police sutron ke mutabik agar sunanda ke parivaar kii taraf se koi shikaayat kare ki kharaab rishte or shashi tharur kii vajah se sunanda kii jaan gai he yaa usee vajah se usne drugs kaa overdoj liya he tab kanoon ke tahat shashi tharur ke khilaaf khudakushi ke liye uksaane yaa majaboor karne kaa maamla ban saktaa he
 So far no one has complained to the police from Sunanda's family

 Separate regional arrangements were made for this post
 videshi dak samudri raste se bhi jaati rahi lekin nai seva bahut lokapriy hui
 During that time, the rate of sending postcards to all Commonwealth countries was to be halved
 baad main vimaan durghatnaon se in companiyon ko jhatka laga
 a Tata Sons ship crashed on 10 January 1939, while an Indian National Airways aircraft in Lahore on 25 February 1939
 phir 1939-45 ke bich khaas taur par dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan hawaii dak seva kaaphi prabhavit hui
 All the air companies were involved in their roles in the fight
 hawaii dak seva chal to rahi thi lekin simit jagahon par hi
 Both Indian companies were working on several routes with the cooperation of Royal Airforce, so the fight greatly improved their financial condition
 yahi tata company july 1946 main air india ke rup main jaani gai
 Until independence, there were 21 registered airlines in India, with 115 Dakota aircraft
 lekin hawaii seva ko lekar sanchaalkon or sarkaar ke bich kaaphi takaraar chal rahi thi
 British Overseas Airways, Air India Ltd
 under the native Airmail service
 (tata airlines), indian neshnal airways aadhi rajsamand, gwalior, elahabaad, queta, peshawar, lahore, rawalpindi, kanpur, lakhanu, rampur, hyderabad, bhopal, bengaluru, cochin, trivendrum aadi ko 1947 ke pehle tak jod chuke the
 Prior to the indo-pak partition, India's air mail terminal was in Karachi, which led to the construction of a new terminal at Palam Airport in November 1947
 baad main bharat ke pehle sanchaar mantri rafee ahamed kidawai ne aal ap skim (sampurna hawaii dak) yojana kii shuruyaat 30 janvari, 1949 ko mahatma gandhi kii barsi par nagpur se kii
 Before this, only special category mail was used by airplane and air surcharge was also levied on it separately
 par aam janata ko laabh pahunchane ke liye hawaii dak sarcharge 1 april 1949 ko hataa diya gaya
 But the postal department increased the rates of postcards and other letters in order to run in a service manner 
 aam aadmi ko isse bahut raahat mili
 During that time, there was a huge increase in postal and operations were becoming difficult
 dak-taar vibhaag dwaara is seva ke shuru karne ke purv karai gai padtaal main yah paaya gaya ki desh main postcardon or anya patron kaa ek chauthai hissaa dilli, mumbai, kolkata, madras, lakhanu, nagpur, elahabaad, kanpur, patna, bhopal tathaa ahmedabad jaataa he
 Of this, 80 percent of the mail was sent to the four major metros alone which were located in four different corners of the country
 dak-taar vibhaag ke paas tab pratham shrenee kii dak kaaphi hoti thi or din main hawaii jahaaj yatri seva ke boj se laden rahete the
 In such a situation, it was decided to start the service at night
 lekin un dinon raat main vimaanon ko utaarne kii suvidha nahin thi
 In this situation, all the security measures at the airports were confirmed
 is seva se hi bhartiya akaash par ratrikalin udaanon kii prabhavi shuruuaat hui
 Earlier airplanes used to fly during the day because they did not have the necessary equipment for the night
 kidawai kii pahal par hawaii dak seva se mumbai, kolkata, madras or dilli ko nagpur se joda gaya
 Every day four ships from these cities would reach Nagpur and stay in the night and return in the morning with the postal of their area
 lekin baadhaaen bhi kaaphi thim or hawaii companiyaan is seva ke liye sarkaar se nunatam laabh kii guarantee or ooncha mehtaanaa maang rahi thim, jiske liye sarkaar taiyaar nahin thi
 Later, after a long debate, the Indian Overseas Airlines agreed to this service without guarantee and started the service in January 1949
 dak tathaa haada hi isaki aay ke strot the
 The company wanted to take a ride at night as well, but the government did not allow this company in view of passenger safety
 is prayaas se kaaphi maatra main dak dhoni shuru ho gai to dak vyavastha sudhaarney main madad mili
 Later, money orders, insured letters, registered newspapers and parcels were also sent on air surcharge from this service
 is seva se tamaam duuri vaale ilaakon main agle roj dak pahunchane lagi
 a letter sent from Srinagar on Monday to Trivandrum on Tuesday afternoon was nothing short of a miracle
 yah seva aam aadmi ke liye kisi vardaan se kam nahin sabit hui, jo postcard or anya patr bhej kar lanbaa intjaar karte the
 The entire post was sent at night, so even the air travelers of the day had no inconvenience
 lekin indian oversij airlines li
 Ceased service on 19 May 1949 because its financial condition had become very bad
 june 1949 ke ant tak dakan airways or indian neshnal airways ne dilli-nagpur ke bich seva shuru kii lekin monsoon ke dauraan seva band kerani padi
 When the services started again after the monsoon, the air companies did not show interest and wanted a guarantee of at least Rs 3 per flight per mile, even though the government was not ready for this condition
 bina guarantee ke seva pradaan karne ke liye himalayan aviation hi aage ai or usne 15 aktubar 1949 se kaam shuru kiya
 But it also had to give special permission to the government to carry goods and passengers in the aircraft
 tab tak raatri udaanon kii sthiti main sudhaar aa gaya tha lihaaja yatri suraksha jokhim pehle sa nahin tha
 0 There was an attempt to placate the passengers by reducing the airfare for night travel at that time
 tab kolkata se mumbai raatri seva kaa haada 172 rupye tha jabaki din kaa haada 205 rou
 Nightly fare from Madras to Delhi is Rs 191 and Rs 220 for the day
 tha
 The airline also got a good number of passengers at night and this company continued to run until May 1951
 1 june 1951 se dakan airways ko seva kaa license diya gaya
 But at the same time all the airlines were nationalized and after 1 August 1953, Indian Airlines handled the service very efficiently
 isi seva kaa phayda uthaate hue pehali baar hawaii parcel kii shuruuaat kii gayi or 1951 se maniorder bhi aal ap seva se aane lage
 This was a new revolution in Indian postal history
 haalanki us dauraan vimaan durghatnaon kii dar kaaphi thi

 seb kaa kaarobaar khatre main he
 This is a way to keep a population of 80 lakh in a big prison
 unhen yaa to sena kii marzi par yaa aatankwaadiyon-algaavvaadiyon ke raham par rakhana he
 If there had been reliable social or political representatives out of prison, perhaps there would have been some effort to get this population out of its ever increasing desperation
 ve bhartiya loktantr ke bheetar phir bhi kashmir ke hisse kii gunjaaish banaae rakhte
 If the government still objected to them, it would have allowed the mps of mainstream political parties to go there
 lekin yah kaam bhi nahin kiya gaya
 Rahul Gandhi was returned from the airport
 seetaram yechuri or ghulaam nabi azaad supreme court kii ijazat ke baad vahaan ja sake
 Overall, Kashmir was isolated from any form of political process
 sarkaar ne dhara 370 hataa di, lekin diwaar khadi kar di or isi par vah apni peeth thapthapa rahi he
 But what the government has done after this is going to generate more fear and surprise
 ek lobbying farm ke taur par jaani jane vaali sanstha ke zarie europea sangh ke 27 saansadon ko bharat aakar pradhanmantri se milane or kashmir jane kaa nyotaa diya gaya
 Of those who came, 4 refused to go there
 ek ne bilkul spasht kaha ki vah sarkaar kaa mouthpis banane ke liye nahin aae hai, agar unhen khul kar logon se baat karne kii ijazat nahin di gai to vahaan jane kaa koi faaydaa nahin he
 Another MP wondered why not Indian mps and leaders when they were being allowed to go there? If it was diplomacy at the Indian government level, it was worse than a clumsy PR exercise
 yah baat khulne main jaraa bhi vaqt nahin laga ki europea sangh ke saansadon kaa yah daura europea sansad kaa aadhikarik daura nahin he, balki inhen inaki nijee haisiyat se bulaayaa gaya he
 It also became clear that these mps were elected on the basis of their political trends, which are broadly right-wing or right-wing
 ab yah sawaal uth rahaa he ki ek lobbying farm ko itani takat or haisiyat kaise de di gai ki vah in saansadon ko bheji ja rahi chitthee main bataae ki vah inhen pradhanmantri se milaaegi or kashmir le jaaegi? yahi nahin, sawaal yah bhi uth rahaa he ki is samooche tamzam ke peeche kiskaa paisa he?lekin is puri qavaayad kaa nateeja kya hota dikh rahaa he? pehla andeshaa to yahi he ki bharat sarkaar ne apni ore se is maamle ke antarrashtriyakaran kii ek gunjaaish paidaa kar di he
 When you call external mps in such an environment, then not only them, others also get the right to comment
 phir zaruri nahin ki ye saare ke saare saansad lagbhag vahi bhashaa bolen jo aap chaahate hai
 One of these mps has also said that the EU can mediate if India and Pakistan want to
 doosraa nateeja or udhaas karne vaala he
 Correspondents closely watching the most important ministries of the government are confirming that the Ministry of External Affairs stands unaware or far from this whole exercise
 ye saare faisale pradhanmantri karyaalay ke str par kiye ja rahe hai
 It also surprises that these mps from Europe were introduced to the National Security Advisor, apart from the Prime Minister and not the Foreign Minister
 to kya vaideshik maamalon main bhi piemo videsh mantralay ko kinare kar rahaa he?agar aisa he- jo bahut saare anya maamalon main bhi dikhataa he to kai lihaaj se khataranaak he
 In spite of all the ups and downs of the last few years, the people who have been in the hands of Indian foreign policy, have a greater understanding of international diplomacy and a far better experience in dealing with its complexities
 yahaan lekin is anubhav kaa laabh tak lene kii koshish nahin kii gai, jiskaa bhi yah nateeja he ki yah sari qavaayad ek haasyaaspad khel main badal gai
 It is also a violation of the parliamentary structure of Indian democracy in which the executive has to function as a cabinet headed by the Prime Minister
 abhi to aisa lag rahaa he ki sari shaktiyaan sirf pradhanmantri karyaalay main simit ho gai hai or baaqi mantralay- videsh mantralay tak- bemaani bana die gaye hai
 It may be recalled that some of the documents that came out about the Rafale deal showed a complaint from the Ministry of Defense that the PMO is in parallel talks about the deal and this is having an impact on the Indian capability of bargaining
 kashmir par lauten
 If we consider it to be our integral part, then it also has to be proved
 vah diwaar giraani hogi jo kashmir main baaki bharat ko- uske raajnneetik numaayindon ko aane-jane se rokatii he
 You should neither trust Kashmiris nor other people - and despite this, keep saying that if Kashmir is your own then this emotional argument will not work
 lekin yah daleel kaa nahin, desh kaa maamla he- kashmir ko khuli hawa main saans lene dijie, use baaqi duniya se baat karne dijie, thodi-bahut raajnneeti karne dijie, gusse main kuch bolne bhi dijie, tabhi vah saamaanya hoga or hamaare qareeb hoga
 Otherwise, the longer the situation stretches, the more Kashmir will slide back
 europea saansadon kii haasyaaspad yatraaen sarkari koshishon ko avishwasaneey hi banaaengi
 India has strongly objected to the shelling by Pakistan

 The CEO of Twitter had said that he could not attend this hearing due to very short notice
 31 sadasyeey sansadeey samiti ne 'soshal media / online news media plateform par nagarikon ke adhikaron kii raksha' par twitor ke adhikari se charchaa kii
 The concern of the Indian government was that the privacy of the citizens' data should be kept safe and social media platforms should not interfere in the upcoming elections
 samiti ne twitor se yah sanishchit karne ko kaha he ki bhartiya chunaav kisi bhi tarah se kisi videshi sanstha se prabhavit yaa damit na hon or company in masalon ke samaadhaan ke liye bhartiya chunaav ayog ke saath milakar kaam kare

 sarkaar ne twitor par aapattijanak content or raajnneetik purvaagrah vaale content ko apane plateform ko hataane main sust hone kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The House panel, headed by BJP MP Anurag Thakur, had earlier summoned Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey on allegations of ensuring the safety of Twitter users and adopting an alleged discriminatory attitude with nationalist posts on the platform
 dorsi kii anupasthiti main crowell ne 31 sadasyeey sansadeey samiti ke samaksh twitor kaa pratinidhitiv kiya
 Recently, members of the right-wing organization Youth for Social Media Democracy protested outside the Twitter office
 unka aarope tha ki twitor ne 'dakshinpanth virdohi rukh' akhriyaar kiya he or unke acounts ko band kar diya he
 However, Twitter denied these allegations
 twitor kaa kahana he ki company vichaardhaara ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav nahin karti he

 parivaar ne ise bedakhal kar rakhaa he
 It is being told that he is getting upset about the case of a plot
 maansik haalat thik nahin he
 This is not the first case of throwing a shoe at a leader
 isse pehle tamaam netaaon par juute phenke gaye hai
 In 2016, during the roadshow for the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, a shoe was thrown at Sitapur on Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 janvari 2016 membihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par pike raay naam ke ek vyakti ne juuta phenkaa tha
 However he was immediately arrested

 It is important for any democracy in the world that its citizen should understand his rights, duties and for this it is very important that he be equipped with the right information
 juthi, kharaab yaa adhakachari soochnaaon se las naagarik loktantr ke liye ghaatak ho saktaa he
 Many times people make the mistake of believing that if the leader is better then democracy will get better and in the same way citizens too
 aisa kabhi hota nahin he
 The citizen has to be aware only when the leader and democracy are better
 isliye aap apane jivan main news ko mahatv dete hai
 Some people also carry newspapers in the toilet and some keep watching news sites on mobile phones standing in the train
 kuch log niyamit radio sunate hai to kuch log shaam ko ghar pahunchakar tivi on karte hai
 To know what happened in the country world
 agar khabaren zaruri nahin hotin to mahangaai ke dinon main aap do kilo aalu main katautee kii jagah akhbaar yaa tivi band kar dete
 Every citizen believes that the information to be accessed should be unbiased and reliable
 sarkaar bhi apane madhyamon se news pahunchaati he
 Every institution makes its claim on the basis that it shows the most correct and fair news
 isliye kai media sansthaanon ke tagaline main satya hota he
 Whether it is in the news or not, it can be a matter of controversy
 aap khabar padhate vakt is baat ko mahatv dete hai ki peshewar paimaanon kaa paalan kiya gaya hoga
 So now, from Twitter to the tractor, the lifestyle of the journalists is being discussed
 isliye aap jaananaa chaahate hai ki media kitna swatantra he
 Many people also tell us that you speak openly
 aap sochiyegaa ki kyon kisi patrkaar se kehete hai ki aap khulkar bolte hai
 Would you like me to say that Ravish ji you do very well, you speak fearfully
 khul kar nahin bolte hai
 Well let's praise the government because we voted for this government
 main aksar aisi tasviren letaa rahata hum jab aap naagarik ankhen gadaakar akhbaar pard rahe hote hai
 Even then, would you have read these newspapers with full fervor and were only full of government press releases? i don't think you're such a boring reader or viewer
 aap zarur sarkari daavon ke samaanant alag daawey yaa raay padhanaa chaahate honge
 The bureaucracy is unbridled, but after winning the election, if a leader tells his bureaucracy how to control the media, then think what will be its effect

 If the charge is proved, the editor, the reporter may face up to two years in prison

 Chief Minister Kejriwal had told the court in his case that these provisions of defamation are against freedom of expression

 Kejriwal himself is accused of taking press clippings without any evidence and never giving any evidence
 manahani or kanoon ke chakkaron se har reporter darataa he or daregaa
 Defamation of defamation will continue
 vaise hamaare desh main kai baar udyogpati aise saadhaaran se notice bhejkar reporter ko daraa dete hai
 Now the government will do the same
 aapmen se kai log hamase sampark karte hai ki phalane vibhaag main ghapala chal rahaa he yaa adhikari laaparvaah he isaki khabar likhiye taaki sarkaar karrvai kare
 You citizens do the right thing
 lekin jab sarkaar apane adhikari se kahe ki kuch aapattijanak lage to hamako bataao ham reporter par hi manahani karenge to hamaare saath aap bhi mukademe main lapet liye jaaenge
 So it can be against the circular press as well as against you
 duniya main koi aisi khabar nahin hoti jo shat pratishat satya ho
 Rather, the news is closer to the fact than to the truth
 kai baar bilkul kareeb hoti he to kai baar dur hokar bhi sahi nishane par hoti he
 On the basis of all such news, governments have fallen and democracy has survived
 jis tarah se media har daur main acha yaa bura rahaa he usee tarah se har daur main sarkaron ne media ko saadhane kaa prayaas kiya he or media ne har daur main apni jagah banaai he

 Chief Minister or any institution
 2013 main hamaari sansad kii standing cameti ne ped news ke sandarbh main report di he or 2011 main britain main levesan kii report ne bhi kai mahatvapurn upaay sujhaaye hai
 That's why you value news in your life
 kuch log toilet main bhi akhbaar lekar jate hai or kuch train main khadey-khadey mobile phone par news site dekhte rahete hai
 Some people listen to regular radio and some people reach home in the evening and turn on the TV
 jaanane ke liye ki desh duniya main kya hua
 If the news was not necessary, then during inflation, you would turn off the newspaper or TV instead of cutting two kilos of potatoes
 har naagarik maanata he ki us tak pahunchane vaali soochna nishpaksh or vishwasaneey ho
 The government also delivers news through its medium
 har santhaan apni daavedaari hi is baat par karata he ki wo sabase sahi or nishpaksh khabaren dikhaata he
 Therefore there is truth in the tagline of many media institutions
 khabar main ho yaa na ho yah vivaad kaa vishay ho saktaa he
 While reading the news you value that professional standards must have been followed
 isliye ab twitor se lekar tractor par patrakaron kii jeevanstyli se lekar mitramandali kii charchaa hone lagi he
 So you want to know how independent the media is
 kai log hamen bhi kehete hai ki aap khulkar bolte hai
 You will wonder why you tell a journalist that you speak openly
 kya aap mujhe yah kahana pasand karenge ki raveesh ji aap bahut acha karte hai dar dar kar bolte hai
 Do not speak openly
 acha karte hai ki sarkaar kii vaahvahee karte hai kyonki hamane isi sarkaar ko vot kiya he
 i often take such pictures when you are reading newspapers with a blind eye
 kya tab bhi aap in akhabaaron ko chaav se padhate ye sirf sarkari press relise se bhari hotin? mujhe nahin lagata ki aap itane boring pathak yaa darshak hai
 You must want to read different claims or opinions similar to government claims
 naukarshahi belgaum he lekin chunaav jeetne ke baad koi netaa apni naukarshahi ko yah rasta bataaye ki media par kaise lagaam lagaani he to sochiye ki iskaa asar kya hoga
 However, India ranks 136th out of 180 countries in the world in terms of media freedom
 pehle se hi kam he
 The Chief Minister of Delhi has issued a circular to the officials that if they feel that any news is not correct or objectionable, they can ask the Principal Secretary to file a criminal defamation case
 aarope sabit hua to sampadak, reporter ko do saal kii jail ho sakati he
 The government has also constituted a committee to monitor the news which will pick up a complaint and send it to the principal secretary between 9 to 11 in the morning
 mukhyamantri kejariwal ne apane maamle main adaalat se kaha tha ki ye jo manahani ke praavdhaan hai abhivyakti kii azaadi ke kilaaf hai
 But perhaps there are two types of freedom in his mind, one is Kejriwal freedom and the other is defamatory freedom
 khud kejariwal par aarope he ki bina kisi saboot ke press cliping lekar aarope laga dete hai or kabhi saboot nahin dete hai
 Every reporter is scared and intimidated by defamation and rounds of law
 manahani kaa laabehani hi karata rah jayega
 By the way, many times in our country, industrialists intimidate reporters by sending such simple notices
 ab sarkaar bhi vahi karegi
 Many of you contact us that there is a scandal in the so-called department or if the officer is careless, write the news so that the government can take action
 aap naagarik ekadam sahi kaam karte hai
 But when the government tells its officer that if something seems objectionable, tell us, we will defame the reporter only, then you will also be caught in the case with us
 lihaaza yah circular press ke saath-saath aapke khilaaf bhi ho saktaa he
 There is no news in the world which is 100 percent true
 balki khabaren satya ke nahin tathy ke kareeb hoti hai
 Sometimes it is close, and sometimes even after being away, it is on the right target
 aisi tamaam khabaron ke aadhaar par sarkarein giri hai or loktantr bachaa he
 The way the media has been good or bad in every round, in the same way, in every round, the governments have tried to help the media and the media has made its way in every round
 media ke ek aise hi daur kii tippanee suna rahaa hum
 
 
 'no matter how much someone shouts, newspapers do not improve
 logon ko bhadakaakar is prakaar akhbaar kii bikri badhaakar kamai karnaa, yah paapi tarika akhbaar waalon kaa he
 It is better to stop the newspapers than to fill the page with such false things, or if the editor finds some other business to fill the stomach instead of doing such work
 ' 2015 main media ko bazaaru kehane vaale modi yaa media ko manahani se daraane vaale kejariwal ne nahin, balki mahatma gandhi ne ye baat kahi he
 12 February 1947
 us daur kaa udhaaharan diya jab bhartiya press angrejon se loha le rahaa tha
 There is no need to be happy with an example
 gandhi ko kot isliye kar rahaa hum ki jis sarkaar ne manahani ke liye nigaraanee kaa circular nikaala he uske netaa bhi ek part time gandhi part tu pakad laae the or apni ladaai ko azaadi kii duusari ladaai bataate the
 The comments pehali azaadi kii ladaai ke time main jab bombai chronical akhbaar ko manahani ke cese main baari jurmaana dena padaa to gandhi ne 7 agast 1924 ko yang india me likhaa, 'press lau kii jagah rashtradroh or manahani ke naam kii nai gatividhi ne jagah le lee he
 While writing a newspaper editor does not break his words on the gold scales
 jaldbaazi main galati kar saktaa he
 These defamation cases are meant to break the morale of Indian journalism so that public criticism becomes cautious and submissive
 main gair zimmedaar yaa anuchit aalochana ko pasand nahin karata lekin satark rahane kii aadat andar se aani chahie
 Should not be imposed from outside
 ' Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal talks about a public trial of the media where the crowd will decide
 phir circular or in donon ke bich yah faisla ki tivi kii bahes main sarkaar yaa party kaa pratinidhi nahin jayega
 If you can do good work then should any good person be given the right to not let others do good work
 agar patrkaar ko kanoon kaa dar dikhaayenge to vah jokhim uthaakar kisi khabar ko ujagar karne kaa acha kaam kaise karegaa
 This is the basic kochhan, the rest is what has been done and it has been for five years
 ye manahani kii rangadari he yaa media ko javabdehi kaa khoff paidaa karnaa
 Who will clean the media's shortcomings
 mukhyamantri yaa koi sanstha
 In 2013 the Standing Committee of our Parliament reported in terms of paid news and in 2011 the Leveson report in Britain also suggested several important measures
 agar khabaren zaruri nahin hotin to mahangaai ke dinon main aap do kilo aalu main katautee kii jagah akhbaar yaa tivi band kar dete
 Every citizen believes that the information to be accessed should be unbiased and reliable
 sarkaar bhi apane madhyamon se news pahunchaati he
 Every institution makes its claim on the basis that it shows the most correct and fair news
 isliye kai media sansthaanon ke tagaline main satya hota he
 Whether it is in the news or not, it can be a matter of controversy
 aap khabar padhate vakt is baat ko mahatv dete hai ki peshewar paimaanon kaa paalan kiya gaya hoga

 Is already low

 sarkaar ne khabaron par nigaraanee ke liye ek cameti bhi banaai he jo rose subah 9 se 11 ke bich shikaayat karne laayak maamle ko chunegi or pramukh sachiv ko bhejegi
 Chief Minister Kejriwal had told the court in his case that these provisions of defamation are against freedom of expression
 magar shaayad unke dimag main do prakaar kii azaadi he ek kejariwal azaadi doosraa manahani vaali azaadi
 Kejriwal himself is accused of taking press clippings without any evidence and never giving any evidence

 After Priyanka's departure, the Bharatiya Janata Party purified the statue of Shastri
 darasal, buudhvaar ko jab priyanka gandhi ne laal bahadur shastri kii murti kaa maalyarpan kiya to uske baad bhaajapa kaaryakarta vahaan par pahunche
 After which the BJP purified the idol with the Ganges water

 Bollywood's three super Khans snatched Hrithik Roshan's peace
 tal gai 'kits' kii religeritik khule aasmaan main apni patang udaane ke liye maukey kii talash kar rahe hai, lekin khan he ki apana dam dikhaane main lage hai
 The news in Bollywood is that the release of Hrithik's film 'kites' has also been postponed for the third time
 ab ye film 15 farvari, 2010 ko relies nahin ho rahi, kyonki farvari par apana daawa thonk diya bollywood ke badshaah ne
 Shahrukh's film Baadshah Shahrukh Khan's film 'my Name Khan' is being released
 kehete hai ki rithik ke pita rakesh bollywood ke don ke se koi panga nahin chaahate the, isliye unhone 'kits' kii relies ko or aage le jane main hi apni bhalaai samajhi
 Earlier, Aamir hit the ground saying that earlier Hrithik had plans to release the film in the month of December

 Salman started this process of cutting 'kites' of Silsilaritic from Salman
 rithik kii film 'kaitas' ko diwaali ke maukey par relies karne kii taiyaari ho chuki thi
 October 16, 2009 was also the date, but Salman is Salman
 jab apni par aa jate hai to phir khud kii bhi nahin sunate
 In this way, Hritik's kite has been cut from three Khan's doors 3 times
 ab ye sanyog he yaa khan kaa khauf, ye to rithik hi jaane, lekin philhal 'kits' kii relies kii taarikh tay nahin he
 On the kissing scene, not only the scissors cut Hrithik's kite, but also the scissor that Hrithik went on, but Hrithik is beating his hands and feet to save the kiss
 agar kis batch gaya to bhi koi phayda nahin, kyonki rithik ke lakhon phans nahin dekh paaenge unki ye film
 The church's board has objected to the 'A' certificate being given to Barbara and Hrithik's most spectacular 'kiss' scene
 sensor khud ko kanchi chalaane se roak nahin paa rahaa
 That scene is so tremendous
 yahi nahin, jabardast kising seen ke chalate sensor board film ko 'e' certificate dene kaa man bana chukaa he
 If Hrithik's film Kites gets an 'A' certificate, then obviously his fans under 18 will be deprived of seeing Hrithik's new avatar
 kahin khwab dhare na rah jaekab agar film ko sensor ke 'e' certificate se bachaana he, to film se wo kis seen nikaalnaa hoga
 If this happens, Hrithik's dream of making a new record on the screen will be incomplete
 parade ke sabase hot hero kaa tamgaa hasil karne kaa rithik kaa khwab khwab hi rah jayega
 The agreement is not the only nationalist film 'kites' in the headlines due to Barbara
 film main aisa ection or thrill he, jo ab tak logon ne sirf hollywood kii film main hi dekha hoga
 It is said that a scene of a car accident was so dangerous that Hrithik sat up to his knees
 ab rithik ke paas samjhauta karne ke alaava koi chaara nahin
 If someone has to be taken to the screen, then an 'A' certificate has to be obtained
 agar 18 saal ke kam umr ke phans tak apana jokhim bharaa ection lekar janaa he to film se kis seen nikalvaanaa hoga
 Let us see which path Hrithik and his father lead

 The Supreme Court said on Tuesday that it would consider the audio clip of Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa in the case of 17 disqualified mlas of the congress-jd (S), allegedly in reference to the mlas
 nyaayamurti en ve raman, nyaayamurti sanjeev khanna or nyaayamurti krishna murari kii teen sadasyeey peeth ne kaha ki chunki yah maamla uske sangyaan main laayaa ja gaya he, isliye sheersh adaalat is par vichaar karegi

 This alleged audio clip of BS Yeddyurappa is of a party meeting in Hubli recently, in which he is expressing displeasure towards his leaders who were opposing the ticketing of these mlas who were disqualified for the by-election to be held on December 5
 
 yah audio clip shuukravaar ko hi saamne aayaa he

 Amid opposition from local party leaders in these 15 constituencies, Yeddyurappa had recently assured that the disqualified mlas would be given tickets if they wanted to contest on a BJP ticket

 cricket main kai baar aapako kuch kismat kii jarurat hoti he taaki aap 30 se 60 tak pahunch sako or phir aap ek shandaar pari khelte ho
 "the captain said," He is very close to this thing and we are quite confident that he will be able to play such an innings

" vah team ke saath kaaphi samay tak khadey rahe, khaskar aap jab is calendar saal ko dekhenge to pataa chalegaa ki unhone kaisaa pradarshan kiya he
 i don't think anyone should be criticized for one or two innings because it can happen to any batsman
 'kohli ne saath hi kamjor madhya kram kii baat ko nakaar diya or kaha ki sheersh kram majboot he isliye is tarah kii charchaa hoti he
 He said, 'see, this kind of discussion will always go on because our top order is very strong and so these people have very little chance to bat
 jab vah ballebaaji karte hai or chaar main se ek yaa do baar vah acha nahin kar pate hai to hamen lagata he ki madhya kram kamjor he, lekin ham wo samay bhul jate hai jab vah acha karte hai
 He said, "if you look at the first three matches that we have played, their contribution has been good
 ham 300 ke paar tak gaye the or kisi ne ise lekar kuch nahin kaha
 After this, in a match where we could not score big, then everyone started talking
 'bharat ne abhi tak is vishwa cap main chah match khele hai or 11 ankon ke saath ankatalika main duusare sthaan par he

 And here you are
 
 
 bhaashan aarambh ho gaye hai
 The principal and the class-teachers of class XII are telling the students about their hopes
 zyaadaatar chaatro ko in aashaaon se koi sarokaar nahin he
 They are busy talking to each other in a suppressed voice
 qareeb bees minute ke baad akhirkaar bhaashan samaapt ho gaye or ab chaatro kaa utsaah badhaane ke liye kuch puraskaron kii ghoshnaa kii ja rahi he
 a pen, copy, or geometry box is often given as an award
 
 
 
 i have never received any award till date
 pichley baarah varshon main main kabhi kaksha main sabase adhik ank nahin laa sakaa, main khel-kud main bhi bhaag nahin le paata tha or kinhin anjaan kaarnon se main shikshakon ke sabase priy chaatro main bhi nahin rahaa
 The award winners are being called one by one on the stage
 main har udghoshnaa ko dhadkate dil se sun rahaa hoon ki shaayad meraa naam bhi pukaara jaae; lekin jaise-jaise manch par rakhi mez se pen-set, kapiyaan or jeometry box ek-ek kar anya chaatro main bant rahe hai, meri aashaa kamazor padati ja rahi he, main vigyaan padhgaye vaale chaatro kii 'vishisht' pankti main baithkar gaurav kaa anubhav to kar rahaa hoon, lekin ek khushi, jiske liye main pichley kai saalon se lalayit rahaa hoon, vah ek baar phir mere haathon se phisalati hui mahasoos ho rahi he, haalaanki main skool main hue test main duusare sthaan par rahaa or maine mote taur par pichley do varshon main vigyaan or angrezi main anya chaatro kii banisbat behatar pradarshan kiya he
 
 
 But the award? i never get that! 
 
 or is varsh ke sarvshereshth chaatr kaa puraskaar jaataa he lalit kumaar ko'', manch par puraskaron kii ghoshnaa kar rahe adhyaaapak ne achaanak kaha

 chaatro ne anmani-si taaliyaan bajaakar meraa swaagat kiya
 Shortly thereafter, the envelopes of Samosas were distributed among the students
 adhyaaapak bhi principal mahoday ke kamare main chaay-naashte ke liye chale gaye or sabhi chaatr apane-apane lifaafe se chizein nikaalkar khaane lage
 
 
 
 lekin mujhe us sannaate ne phir se gher liya tha
 i was crying silently in one corner of the field

 From the point of view of society, the person who walks on crutches gets the award only because he is disabled
 koi viklang vyakti bhi kisi oonchaai ko chhu saktaa he- aisi koi kalpana meraa samaaj kar hi nahin saktaa tha
 The life of none of my classmates was as annoying as mine
 
 
 mere kisi bhi sahpaathee ne skool kii padhai puri karne ke liye utani mehnat nahin kii thi jitani mujhe kerani padi thi
 
 
 None of my classmates had to kill their minds
 
 
 padhai ke liye apane sharir ko toduya nahin padaa tha- lekin phir kyon mere sahpaathee ne mujhe taana diya?maidan ke ek akele kone main baithe hue maine nishchay kar liya ki main us sahpaathee ko gussa jataa kar nahin, balki apni uplabdhiyon se uttar doongaa
 The teacher had agreed that i am the best
 
 
 ab mujhe apane us sahpaathee ko bhi aisa jawaab dena tha jise vah chaahe bhi to nakaar na sake
 The board exam was near, i had to prove myself
 or maine thik vahi kiya
 
 
 i got the highest marks in my class in the board examination
 maine siddh kar diya ki mujhe mila vah puraskaar kisi kii sahanubhuti nahin tha

 17 years after its formation, the Liberhan Commission submitted a report on the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition case in Ayodhya to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Tuesday
 jaanch ke dauraan ayog kaa kaarykaal 48 baar badhaayaa gaya, jiske dwaara taiyaar report sevanivrutt nyaayadhish nyaayamurti emes librehan ne grahamantri pi chidambaram kii maujuudagi main pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko saunpi

 chah disambar 1992 ko babari masjid dhahaae jane ke 10 din ke bheetar gathit ayog kisi ghatana kii sabase lambey samay tak jaanch karne vaala ayog ban gaya

 Swami Nityananda's millions of devotees who have gone to Madurai from Bangalore also believe here and that is why they trust their Swami ji blindly
 unke haathon se charnamrita paakar wo khud ko dhanya maanate hai
 But a big blow to his faith and expectations comes from the allegation that Nityananda shares the intoxicating Charanamrit
 umr mahaj 34 saal, chehre par muskaan or jubaan se nikalati paramgyan kii badi badi baaten
 These are disputed Nityananda who have been charged with many serious allegations for the last two years
 jinke khilaaf kai thanon main abtak kai cese darj ho chuke hai or adaalaton main aapraadhik maamalon kii sunwaayee chal rahi he
 Swami Nityananda, already trapped in the web of allegations, is now caught in another sensational controversy
 badi khabar ye he ki pavitra jal main maadak padaarth milaane ke aarope main nityanand ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya gaya he
 The police has informed the Madras High Court that they have registered a case against Nityananda and two others for giving holy water or water containing drugs in the name of Charanamrit to the devotees
 nityanand ke khilaaf em soluikannan kii shikaayat par jab madras hoicourt ke saamne ye maamla sunwaayee ke liye aayaa to sarkari vakil ne adaalat ko jaankaree di ki police ne kai dhaaraon ke tahat nityanand ke khilaaf cese daakhil kar liya he yani ab nityanand funs chuke hai ek nai musiibat main jisase bachanaa unke liye aasaan nahin hoga
 Nityananda has left his Bangalore ashram a few days ago and made his home in Madurai Adabharam, a very old religious institution
 is hairaan karne vaale aarope ke mutabik vivaado main rahane vaale nityanand madurai ke ashram main apane bhakton ko jo pavitra taral prasad dete the usame drugs kii milawat hoti thi
 It is alleged that Nityananda has played with the religious sentiments and health of many of his devotees because the holy water or charanamrit which he distributed as a prasad contained a mixture of narcotics
 hindu makkal kaachi math ke em soluikannan ne adaalat main is binah par yachika daayar kii thi ki police nityanand ke khilaaf unki shikaayat par koi karrwahee nahin kar rahi thi or na hi us pani kii jaanch ho rahi he jo bhakton ko diya ja rahaa he
 The matter has reached the court and the police station
 agar nityanand par aarope sahi sabit ho jate hai to phir sajaa bhi sakht hi hogi
