 The congress-ncp's rule in Maharashtra for 15 years was lost after the 2014 elections, the congress-ncp will vote in the assembly elections in Maharashtra on October 21 and 24 in the ruling Maharashtra
 maharashtra main congress-ensipi kaa gathbandhan ho gaya he or siten bhi bant gai hai
 But there is no seat sharing between the BJP and Shiv Sena
 haalanki donon dalon ne saath chunaav ladane kii baat kahi he
 It is believed that within one to two days, the sharing of seats between the two parties will be announced
 kyonki namakan kii aakhri taarikh chaar oktober bhi najadik aa rahi he
 The question is whether the congress-ncp, which lost the government in 2014, will be able to challenge the ruling bjp-shiv Sena this time
 congress-ensipi main machi he bhagdadrajya main sattadhari bijepi ke paale main aane ke liye congress or ensipi ke netaaon kii line lagi he
 Many big leaders of both parties have joined BJP
 mana ja rahaa he ki isse chunaav main vipaksh ko nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 Because congress-ncp leaders along with their supporters are also shifting into BJP
 maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle paala badalane vaale netaaon kii baat karen to congress ke varisht netaa rahe harshavardhan patil ab bhartiya janata party (BJP) main shaamil ho chuke hai
 Patil was a consistent MLA from Indanagar seat from 1995 to 2009
 vah congress-ensipi sarkaar main mantri bhi rahe
 He lost the 2014 election to NCP candidate Dattatreya Bharan
 isi tarah shiridy vidhansabha seat se paanch baar ke congress vidhayak radhakrishna vikhe patil bhi bijepi main aa chuke hai
 Patil once contested from Shirdi in 1995 on a Shiv Sena ticket and later joined the Congress
 wadala vidhansabha seat se congress vidhayak rahe kalidas kolambakar ne party chhodkar bijepi kaa daaman tham liya he
 The state of 2014 was a coalition government of Congress and NCP in the state for 15 years from 1995
 magar 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 BJP and Shiv Sena had come alone in this election due to breakdown of alliance
 magar bijepi bahumat ke aankade 144 se dur rahi thi
 Yet BJP emerged as the single largest party with 122 seats, while it stood second with 63 seats
 jabaki congress ko 42 or ensipi ko sirf 41 siten milin thim
 After the elections, BJP and Shiv Sena together formed a non-congress government for the second time in the state
 2019 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi netaaon kaa maananaa he ki party akele dam par bahumat ke aankade ko chune kii sthiti main he
 In such a situation, an alliance with Shiv Sena can get more than two hundred seats

 The marginalized Congress in Bihar has formulated a strategy for its rejuvenation in the state
 bihar ke liye congress ke nae prabharee shakti singh gohil ne rajya main party ke sabhi jiladhyakshon ke saath baithak karke ‘plan 2019’ taiyaar kiya he
 The first goal is to improve the party's performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 saath hi bhavishya main bihar main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main party ko majboot sthiti main pahunchaana he
 However, the focus will be on 2019 only
 sutron ke mutabikcongress adhyaksh rahul gandhiore argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ke bich haal main hui mulaakaat main jo chizein tay huin wo bhi bihar ko lekar congress ke plan main shaamil rahengi
 According to sources, 6 big things of the Congress's Bihar plan - 1
 party ne rajya ko 39 jilon main baant kar ranneeti banaai he
 Most who are or will become district presidents in the state, they are not former mlas, former mps or former ministers, due to which they are often weakened in political strings
 isliye party ne tay kiya he ki wo rajya main party ke 27 vidhayakon main se vishwaasapaatr 17 vidhayakon ko nai jimmedaari degi
 a list of 22 veteran, strong and powerful leaders is also being prepared from the state
 2
 Soon all these will be asked to adopt a district
 us jile main party kii majbootee ke liye inako jiladhyaksh ke haath majboot karne honge
 Yes, care will be taken that the MLA and other big leaders will be held responsible for the neighborhood of the neighborhood instead of their district, so that there is no possibility of mutual tussle
 3
 Soon, along with party in-charge Shakti Singh Gohil, four in-charge secretaries will also be appointed, whose job will be to supervise 10 districts each
 rahul gandhi ke sakht nirdesh hai ki monitoring ke baad sabaki javabdehi bhi tay kii jaaegi
 4
 rahul gandhi or lalu yadav kii mulaakaat ke baad tay hua ki, congress agadi jatiyon ke saath hi gaiyr yadav obisi par khaas focus rakhegi
 Actually, Lalu believes that the Congress should look at the vote bank which has gone into the bjp's court
 baaki muslim yadav ko to wo khud hi lamaband kar lenge
 In this context, Lalu also advised Rahul to make Congress state president in Bihar
 ashok choudhary ke jane ke baad se congress pradesh adhyaksh kii kursi khaali he
 5
 congress varshon se bihar kii satta se baahar he, isliye party logon ko bataaegi ki jab wo satta main thi to berogari, kisaan or tamaam virgon ke liye kya- kya yojanaayen laai thi or tab rajya kii kya sthiti thi
 With this, people will be explained what the Congress intends to do in future so that Bihar can be prosperous
 party gelevaar press conference karne ke saath is sab kaa prachaar-prasar karegi
 That is, what was the Congress years ago and what will be the roadmap for the Congress ahead
 6
 Simultaneously, the fisherman Congress that Rahul has formed will be given special expansion in Bihar
 congress ko lagata he ki, bihar main ganga kinare is varg kii acchhee khaasi sankhya he, lekin abhi tak inako lekar ahm yojanaayen nahin hai
 Therefore, the party will focus exclusively on this
 kul milakar chunavi ganit ke saath hi rajya main party ko khadaa karne kii kavayad kii ja rahi he, lekin sawaal ye he ki, arse se party bihar main argedy kii ‘bi team’ banakar rah gai he or aane vaale vakt main bhi aasaani se kuch badalane vaala nahin dikhataa
 In such a situation, putting the paper plan on the ground will be a big challenge for both Rahul Gandhi and Shakti Singh Gohil
 is mudde par gohil kaa kahana he, ‘bhavishya ke liye party apni mehnat main koi kasar nahin chhodeygi, jiskaa phayda 2019 main gathbandhan ke tahat ladane par bhi kuch to milegaa, ham to apana plan bana hi rahe hai
 ' dilli main somvaar kii puri raat barish hoti rahi
 So much rain that the three-year record was broken, but a new batch of troubles also came along
 logon ko sadak jam, haadase or yahaan tak ki metro safar main rukaawat jaisi musiibat jhelni padi
 Due to the sudden rain, the passengers of the metro also faced problems for several minutes
 barish kii vajah se dilli metro kii signal pranali main kharabi aa gai thi
 The Meteorological Department says that such rain will still be another day or two
 punjab main navjot singh siddhu ek baar phir apni hi sarkaar ke liye kirakiri kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 Actually, BJP leader Tarun Chugh has written against him by writing a letter to the governor, he has taken the oath of minister but he has not taken charge yet, he is still enjoying the salary and allowances as a minister
 
 chitthee main likhaa gaya he ki siddhu or siem ke bich vivaad ne sanvaidhanik sankat paidaa kar diya he
 Tarun Chugh further said that he has appealed to the Governor to take a decision in the interest of Punjab, if the minister does not want to work, then someone else should see the department in his place
 iske saath hi agar vah bina kaam ke selary uthaa rahe hai to unke khilaaf karrwai honi chahie
 Let me tell you that Navjot Singh Sidhu is very angry about changing the ministry at this time
 beete chah june ko mukhyamantri amarinder singh ne siddhu se shahari nikaay ke saath paryaton evam saanskrithik maamle vibhaag waapas le liye the or unhen urja evam navikarniya urja vibhaag kaa prabhaar saunpa tha
 t Chugh, BJP: He has migrated & feud b / w CM & him has caused constitutional crisis
 i request Guv to take decision in Punjab's interest
 If Minister doesn't want to work someone else should look after his dept
 If he's drawing a salary but not working, action should be taken

 Even a month after the cabinet reshuffle, Sidhu is yet to assume his new charge
 isse pehle beete june ke aakhri hafte main punjab sarkaar ke visilence beuro kii team ne amritsar impruvement trust ke daftar main chaan-been main jaanch kii he
 The team investigated the papers
 navjot singh siddhu sthaneey nikaay mantri the jinke adheen ye daphtar aata tha
 Even before this, vigilance was investigated in different offices connected with this department
 haalanki SSP pike bakshi kaa kahana he ki kuch shikayaton ko lekar record kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 What has been found in this investigation so far has not been revealed
 mahatma gandhi ke champaran yatra ke 100wein varsh ke avasar par dilli se lekar bihar tak kaaryakramon kii dhooma machi he
 The whole atmosphere is becoming Gandhi
 sarkaar chaahe wo rajya kii ho kya kendra kii donon main hode machi he
 The Bihar government had already started its preparations because of this, it is looking ahead in this competition
 lekin kaaryakramon main ho rahi avyavashtha bhi khulkar saamne aane lagi he
 Programs were held in Muzaffarpur on Tuesday to commemorate Gandhiji's stay in Muzaffarpur
 darasal mujffapur se hi gandhi ji champaran kii yatra par gaye the
 The event organized in his memory showed an atmosphere of chaos
 sarkaar ne is avasar par swatantraaa senaniyon ko sammanit karne kaa bhi kaarykram he
 On April 18, the Bihar government will honor freedom fighters across the country
 lekin mujffapur ke kaarykram main 100 saal kii senaanee rajkumaari devi ko bade sammaan ke saath bulaayaa bhi gaya tha, lekin jyonhi kaarykram khatm hua
 Everyone forgot that elderly fighter
 gauratlab he ki mujffapur ke aunrai kii rahane vaali 100 saal kii ramkumari devi ko prasashan ne card bhejkar sammaan ke saath is kaarykram main bulaayaa tha
 Hearing Gandhiji's name, this elderly woman freedom fighter reached the ceremony but the government forgot them in the crowd of the ceremony
 had to tab hui jab mukhyamantri kaa bhaashan khatm hua, to inako inke haal par chod diya gaya
 This elderly person unable to walk could not even get a wheel chair with which he could be transported to the vehicle
 antat 2 log is bujurg mahila ko jaanavar kii tarah taang kar baahar le jate hue dekhe gaye
 But they were stopped in the direction of passing the Chief Minister's car first, where they had to wait in the same posture for 15 minutes
 police karmiyon ne bhi sahaayta nahin kii
 No one felt pity for a 100-year-old elderly woman freedom fighter
 agar nitish kumaar kii najar padati to shaayad bujurg ke saath aisa vyavhaar nahin hota
 But on April 18, when freedom fighters from all over the country gather in Patna, they will also have to take care of these things
 kyonki jis desh ko aaazaad hue 70 saal ho gaye uske swatantraaa senaanee to bujurg or laachaar hi honge

 Abhinav Pandavudrabhant; National Publishing House, Daryaganj, New Delhi-2 Price: Rs 300
 yudhisthir kaa roopantaranh udbhrantsamikshya kriti 'abhinav pandav' main udbhrant ne mukhyatah yudhisthir ke mithkeey charitra ko samakaleen chetana se samprukt karte hue samasamyik samasyaon ko puraatanta kii jadon se joda he or paaramparik kathakram ko samasamyik arthvistaar diya he
 'mahabharata' is such a story of our ethnic consciousness which is a 'naked form of reality' as opposed to the 'extreme saga of ideal' in the 'ramayana'
 ramswaroop chaturvedi kii baat ko aage badhaate hue kaha ja saktaa he ki samast ''bhartiya jaateeyata kaa puraa vistaar in do chhoron main samaa gaya he
 "it is noteworthy that the poet of Genesis travels between these two ends
 ve ek taraf 'treta' or 'swayamprabha' likhte hai to duusari taraf 'abhinav pandav' or 'pragnavenu'
 In 'treta', where they descend into the narrative through various female characters of that era and keep many women and women right at the center of the narrative so far, in 'abhinav Pandava', through Yudhishthira they are engaged in war and guilt
 Let's try to catch up
 lekin jaisaa ki naam se hi spasht he, 'abhinav pandav' main yudhisthir kaa ek nayaa yaa kahen, aadhunik rup bhi dikhaaya gaya he (or sambhawatah is abhinavtaa kaa pratipaadan hi is kriti kaa vaishishty he) jo aatmaglani kii aag main jalakar apane atmaprakash kaa saakshaatkaar karata he or apane andar ke mahabharat se jujhte or usase baahar nikalate hue ek aam naagarik ke rup main jan-saamaanya ke kalyanarth kaary karata he
 Altering some of the popular narratives of the Mahabharata, the illustration concludes that Yudhishthira was sent to death as an ordinary human after being in hell for 'two hours'
 yah yamraj dwaara yudhisthir ko di gai sa
 Was going ullekhneey he ki apane is naveen vidhaan ke roopak ke peeche udbhrant rajasatta kii jagah loksatta kii sthapana karte hai
 Yudhishthira's conversion from a powerful king to a common man can be traced largely to the worldwide phenomenon of religion and sovereignty gradually becoming weak / irrelevant after the Renaissance
 sangrah ke antim do sargon 'yama-dharm' or 'kalki-dharm' ko milakar padhein to yah samajhte der nahin lagati ki udbhrant dwaparkaalin 'rajasuya yajna' ko aadhunik poonjivadi samrajyavad ke vistaar se itar nahin dekh rahe or satta kii lipsaa ho yaa dhan ke liye hode, har yug main lade jane vaale mahabharat ke mul main yahi pravritiyaan hoti hai
 The concept of Yudhishthira's incarnation as an ordinary citizen has its roots in the denial of blind consumerism and the message of discharging a simplistic lifestyle
 shoshiton or peediton ke haq main ladane / unhen nyaay dilaane or prithvi ko har khatre se bachaane or use agali peedi tak surakshit hastantarit karne main hi is 'abhinav pandav' kii sarthakata he
 While commenting on this work, Shiv Kumar Mishra calls it 'kathakavya' and 'thinkacavya', while the creator himself has its canto-oriented system, the inclusion of a long era in it from 'dwapara' to 'kaliyug' (modern), raja-nayaka like Yudhishthira (with the characteristics of a villain or, say, a downtrodden hero) and an extraordinary character like Krishna, the characterization of the hero, the mutual confluence of imagination, the novelty of narrative presentation Is not intended to contend for his desire to develop in the interests of the public and etc
 So the epic many based on the elements' innovative Pandavas
 naresh mehta ne elahabaad sangrahalay main die apane vyaakhyaan (madhyam ahdhail-june, 2001) main mahakavy ke parivartit hote rup or uski rachnadrushti par kaaphi vistaar se charchaa kii thi
 He had said, "the epic is the name of the creative vision of poetry, not the name of the form
" ''udbhrant bhi uganuroop mahakavy ke nae maanakon ke gadhe jane par bal dete hai
 It is worth mentioning that in the history of modern Hindi poetry, works like 'kamayani', 'urvashi' had to go through well thought-out logic schemes in the category of epic
 prastut kriti ke madhyam se udbhrant ne 'mahakavy' ke rup or uske peeche kii drushti par jo bahes chhedi he, vah aage badhaai jaaegi
 And then perhaps the stagnant tradition of management in Hindi poetry will be able to move forward and the epic form of Hindi poetry will retain its relevance and importance in its contemporary and modern contexts

 If sources are to be believed, the central government can withdraw its notification

 iphone x launch ke baad se america main ek privesi ko lekar sawaal uthne shuru ho gaye hai
 The question is that the fingerprint scanner i
e
 Touch ID from iphone x has now been replaced with Facial Recognition i
e
 Face ID
 matlab ye he ki ab aapako iphone x analock karne ke liye cheharaa dikhaane kii jarurat hogi chaahe din ho yaa raat
 The company has introduced a technology that scans the face even in the dark
 sabase pehle aapako apane phase scan karke faseprint seve karnaa hoga jise yphone khud karegaa
 Now the question arises that whether every user's biometric details will be saved on the faceprint apple server? Or it will remain in the phone of customers only
 ricode kii ek report ke mutabik america sinetter franken ne kai sawaal uthaae hai or company se privesi or sefguard ke bare main jaankaree kii maang kar rahe hai
 Their main question is where will the biometric data be kept? They believe that Apple can sell faceprints collected from these new unlocking systems to other sectors for the benefit of their business
 iske alaava nigaraanee ke liye company kisi third party agency ko de sakati he
 They also believe that government agencies can also demand users' faceprints from Apple
 unhone facial ricognishan ke mudde par aipal ko likhaa he
 According to Recode, Apple has already given its clarification on such issue
 company ke cenier vaais president phil shiller ne kaha he ki facial ricognishan data yuj ke yphone tak hi rahegaa or ise aipal ke cloud sarwar par nahin bheja jayega
 Despite this explanation, American leader Franken has many questions from Apple's Timo Cook
 in sawaalon main mukhya taur par ye shaamil hai
 - Will Apple or the third party have the ability to use remotely or mobile access to the user faceprint data stored by the iphone X
 - franken ne yah bhi kaha he ki aisa sambhav he ki aipal baad main apana faisla badal le or ise remoteli apane sarwar par seve karnaa shuru kar de
 If you remember, after San Bernadino shunting, Apple refused the FBI to unlock his iphone
 maamal court tak gaya, lekin phir bhi aipal apni privesi policy kaa hawala dekar lock naa kholane par ada rahaa
 But the FBI later unlocked the private hacker's iphone
 baad main baat saamne ai kii epabiai ne iske liye ek spesh tul kharida he jisase shooter kaa yphone main kholaa gaya
 However, after Franken's rebuttal to Apple that he would not give biometric data to anyone else, he has once again asked for concrete information on this
 gauratlab he ki bharat main bhi aadhaar ko lekar aisi bahes lagaataar jari he, kyonki aadhaar ke liye bhi yugers kii biometric ditels lee ja rahi he
 Now there is the same problem with the iphone x somewhere
 philhal company ne franken ke is bayaan ke baat kuch bhi nahin kaha he

 chhattisgarh kaa abujhmaad desh kaa abhinn hissaa hone ke baavjood aaj bhi desh ke naqshe main nahin he
 Before and after independence, the borders of all the states of the country were drawn
 in rajyon ke sambhaago , jilon , block , gaanv or kasbo kaa nakshaa bana lekin chhattisgarh ke abujhmaad kaa sarkaar ke paas na to koi naapjok he or naa hi koi nakshaa
 Now for the first time survey of Abujhmad is being done so that its map can be made
 chhattisgarhke abujhmaad ilaake kaa ye wo hissaa he jahaan drone ke jariye is ilaake ke khaakaa khinchaa ja rahaa he
 This area remains the first for the country till date
 aazaadee ke baad se is ilaake main naa to kabhi jansankhya darj kii gai he or naa hi sarkari yojanao kaa namonishaan he
 Even in this area there is a ban in movement of common people
 yah roak aaj se nahin balki angreji shashan kaal se chali aa rahi he
 This prohibition is constitutional as the protected tribes reside here
 unki pahchaan or saamaajik badlaav ke khatre ke maddenjar aam logon kii awajahi par roak lagaai gai he
 Permission from the administration is required for admission here
 abujhmaad main nivasarat janajati maujuuda aadhunikeekaran , vikaas or paashchaatay samskruti se koshon dur he
 Arriving here, one realizes the primitive era
 bastar ke konta ke vidhayak kavasi lakhma ke mutabik abujhmaad ke log apana pataa thikaana bataane ke liye hi chhattisgarh ke naam kaa ullekh kartehain
 The reality is that these tribals are completely dependent on Telangana for their livelihood
 indravati nadi paar kar wo vahaan ke gaanv main foresti product bechate hai
 He also provides treatment
 vidhayak lakhma yah bhi bataate he ki aazaadee ke itane varshon baad bhi naa rajya sarkaar yahaan pahunch pai he or naa hi centre sarkaar
 On the other hand, Chhattisgarh Revenue Minister Prem Prakash Pandey says that development plans are prepared on the basis of survey
 kam se kam unki sarkaar ne ise gambhir samajha or survey shuru karaayaa
 According to him, since independence, until now, Abujhmad had been part of the united Madhya Pradesh
 yahan kareeb 40 saalon takcongresski sarkaar kabiz rahi lekin usne abujhmaad kii ore jhaanka tak nahin
 For the first time, a state government has started survey work here to solve the Abu Dhuj first of Abujhmad
 desh kaa yah ek aisa hissaa he jiskaa koi land ricard abhi tak nahin he
 Abujhmad could not be included in the map of India because no map of it has been prepared till date
 philhal aazaadee ke baad pehali baar yahaan janaganana or bhu-bhaag kaa akalan kiya ja rahaa he
 After the survey, Abujmad will appear in the map of India, although this part is under the occupation of the Naxalites
 yahan par naksaliyon ke naa keval bade training camp he balki wo unki sharansthaleey bhi he
 The people of Abujhmad live entirely in the forest
 naa to wo kabhi is jangal se baahar aate he or naa hi apane ilaake main bahari logo ko daakhil hone dete he
 Their entire livelihood depends on these forests
 khaane-pine se lekar dainik jivan main kaam aane vaali sabhi vaston ko wo yahi rahakar praapt kar lete he
 Bamboo-made items are also being manufactured in some villages in the name of development
 sarkaar ko ummid he ki is survey ke baad abujhmaad ke halaat badalenge
 Abujhmad is quite natural by nature
 is ilaake main ghanaa jangal to he hi lekin is jangal main kai prajati ke ped paudhe bhi he jo saamanytah dekhne ko nahin milte
 Many types of herbs are also grown here
 jangal se nikalne vaali jadi bootiyon or lakadiyon kii taskari ke liye kai vyapaaree yahan chori chhipe daakhil hote he
 Due to neither the population being recorded in the government records nor the area of area being certified, the development plans of this area could not be prepared
 survey ke baad is ilaake main vikaas ke kaamo kii neenv rakhi jaaegi 
 The survey work is on the shoulders of the IIT Kharagpur team
 dikkt yah he ki is team ko yahaan survey ke liye kadi mashkkat kerani pad rahi he
 He is facing the Naxalites every second
 kabhi drone kii udaan roki ja rahi he to kabhi nae ilaake main daakhil hote vakt naksali pabandi kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 The device was developed for the study of a wide variety of bacteria and viruses, but its use has so far been limited to the study of nucleotides of human cells, due to many mistakes and large differences in sequence

 25 fisadi tak katautee kaa matlab he ki agar koi graahak ab in teenon bank main kisi bhi samay ke liye paisa jamaa karata he to use jamaa par 0
 There will be less profit of up to 25 percent

 15 percent cut
 jabaki bandhan bank ne chote karj par byaaj dar 0
 7 percent reduced to 17
 95 fisadi kar di he
 Revised rates have been applied
 khabar yah bhi he ki nijee kshetra ke echdiefasi bank ne bhi jamaa daron kii samiksha kar rahaa he
 Will the interest rate be lower on the loan? Generally, the cut in the interest rate deposited is seen as a step to cut the interest of the loan given to the customers
 yani mana ja rahaa he ki is kadam se in bainkon se karj lenaa sasta ho jayega
 Explain that after the cut in the policy rate, the central bank had asked banks to give benefits to customers, so that the slowing economy can be accelerated

 But with this, another news related to his love life has come
 vaise yah ranvir singh nahin, ranbir kapur se judi he
 Deepika Padukone has recently advertised a soap for Bangladesh
 unki tasviir jis tarah lee gai he, usase ek hairaan kar dene vaali baat saamne ai he
 Actually, in this picture, the tattoo on the back of Deepika's neck is not visible, which was made by Ranbir Kapoor in the name
 ranbir ke pyaar main banwaaya tha tatudipikaki gardan par bane is tatu main RK likhaa tha
 He built it when his and Ranbir Kapoor's affair was on the upsurge
 donon aksar saath dikhte the or ek duusare ke pyaar main puri tarah duube the
 But then during the shooting of Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani, Ranbir Kapoor moved closer to his costar Katrina Kaif and this RK tattoo was not even appreciated by Deepika's love sign
 deepika ko mila ranvir kaa sathranbir se brallep ke badadipika padukonko ranvir singh main apana pyaar mila
 Deepika, who used to listen first to Ranveer's open-hearted love acts, later opened up with her in public
 isi bich vaise sabhi RK vaale is tatu ke bare main lagbhag bhul hi chuke the ki achaanak is vigyaapan kii tasveeron ne phir uski yaad dilaa di
 By the way, when this tattoo is not visible on Deepika's neck, then it means that as she shows, there is no bitterness about any old thing in her mind
 haalanki sawaal ye uthta he ki kya deepika ne ye tatu ranvir singh ke kehane par hatwaya he? Jubani war continued on Wednesday in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Election Committee and University Administration for the student union elections and both accused each other of charges

 (input ieenes se) 'sahitya Aaj Tak 2019' has started from today (friday), will run from 1 November to 3 November
 pehle din 'sahitya ajtak' ke 'sidhi baat' manch par 'raashtra yaa hindu raashtra' seshan main lekhak or patrkaar ashutosh, lekhika or patrkaar sabaa naqvi ke saath lekhak evam patrkaar vijay trivedi ne bhaag liya
 During this, all the three senior journalists kept their words smoothly
 is seshan kaa sanchaalan ajtak ke agjicutive editor rohit sardana ne kiya
 The books of the three guests were also mentioned at the beginning of the discussion
 charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue rohit ne kaha, desh kaa koi dharm nahin hota, lekin uske baavjood ham is baat se do-chaar hote hai ki kya bharat ek hindu raashtra he
 Senior journalist Ashutosh made his remarks first in the discussion
 uske baad vijay trivedi ne charchaa ko aage badhaate hue kaha ki hindu raashtra ko lekar kanfusion he
 Savarkar was the first to give the concept of Hindu Rashtra
 saavarkar ke concept ko sangh nahin maanata he
 What Ashutosh is saying is Savarkar's Hindu Rashtra
 golwalkar ne kaha he hindustan main jo rahata he vah log hindu hai
 Sarsanghchalak has clarified that Hinduism is incomplete without Muslims
 isliye main kahana chahta hum ki kanfusion zyada he
 There is a big change in mind set, Vijay Trivedi further said that there is a big change in the mind set of people
 sanvaidhanik taur par dekhen to koi yahaan pruthak nahin he
 Both Muslims and Hindus vote together but that is our mindset, when a big government of this country runs without any Muslim mission, when one of the largest party in a big state does not consider anyone as its Muslim representative, then All these raise big questions
 lekin isse alag hai hindu
 The Hindustani of India is tolerant even today
 vah aaj bhi vasudaiv kutunbakam main bharosa karata he
 If it had not happened today, there would have been riots here
 aaj dange nahin ho rahe to uski vajah koi sarkaar yaa raajnneetik party nahin he, vah hindutv he
 Most of our people believe that Gandhi's Hindutva is referring to Gandhi
 swami vivekananda kaa hindutv, supreme court kaa hindutv or maujuuda raajnneetik system kaa hindutv aapse main kanfusion paidaa kar rahaa he or yahi hamen pareshaan kar rahaa he

 sangh virodh ko hi hindu virodh maanate hanvijay trivedi ne apni baat aage or spashtataa ke saath rakhte hue kaha ki ham sangh virodh ko hi hindu virodh maanate hai
 The number of volunteers in the Sangh is around one crore, the population of this country is 130 crores, if Hindus believe it, then it is more than 80 crores
 80 karod main sirf 1 karod swayamsevak hai or ham sangh virodh ko hi hindu virodh maan rahe hai
 Therefore, we are also giving strength to the Sangh and humiliating the Hindus because if there were 80 crores Hindus, there would have been 80 crores volunteers
 12-15 karod logon ne bijepi ko vot kiya hoga wo sabalog sangh ke log nahin hai, usamen se bahut saare log hindu bhi nahin hai isliye sangh virodh ko hindu virodh maananaa is kanfusion ko dur karnaa padegaa
 Sangh which is Hindu ideology, but Hindu ideology is not the ideology of Sangh, unless we clear it, then this dispute will continue every day, we will continue to debate it

 apni sthiti banaae rakhane ke liye vah kai tarah ke kaam karte rahete hai
 Many times, keeping his ally party in the dark, he has been meeting the leaders of Shiv Sena and even MNS
 aisa nahin he ki pratidwandvi partiyon ke netaaon se milanaa yaa unase baatcheet karnaa koi galat baat he, lekin unka andaaj niraala or kuch rahasyamay sa hota tha
 He has always been trying to show something through those meetings
 yani har kadam par raajnneeti!pichley dinon unhone bijepi ke prati apana jhukaav pradarshit kiya, modi ke prati kuch naram se dikhe
 He seemed to be giving some hints
 or shaayad isliye uddhav thakare ko spasht rup se kahana padaa ki pavaar ke liye endie main koi jagah nahin he
 Pawar is now overturned by putting pressure on his ally
 ab ve congress ke prati vafaadaar ho gaye hai
 As a result, he is showering on Narendra Modi
 vah kah rahe hai ki modi kaa maansik chikitsaalay main ilaaj karana chahie
 Not only this, he is also praising the Congress very much
 vah modi ko swatantraaa sangram main congress ke yogadan ke bare main bataa rahe hai
 That means now he is back with his old friend
 lekin sawaal uthta he ki jab congress itani hi mahaan party he to sharad pavaar ise chhodkar kyon chale gaye? or unhone apni party kyon bana lee? dusron ko is dedh sau saal puraani party ke bare main bataanaa unke liye kyon jaruri ho gaya?jahaan tak kisaanon kii baat he to sharad pavaar ne unhen bachaane ke liye kya kiya? gujarat main kisaanon ne to aatmahatya kii hi he, lekin pavaar kaa grih rajya maharashtra to isamen awwal he
 How did he perform as agriculture minister, will he bother to tell? What did his department do to make the Indian agriculture system dependent on the monsoon? This means that Pawar no longer has anything to speak for so that he can get some mileage
 isliye vah phir se congress ke hamalavar kafile main shaamil ho gaye hai
 Excepting decency, he too has started talking very lightly
 pavaar un tamaam netaaon kii qatari main shaamil ho gaye hai jo halki yaa sasti baaten karte hai
 Now this election is such that the dialect of the elders changes here

 raja tatkaal istipha den, anyathaa pradhanmantri ko unhen tatkaal mantrimandal se hataa dena chahie
 Anjaan said that when the Supreme Court has issued a notice to the Communications Minister in the 2G spectrum case, he should resign from the post of minister on morality himself
 unhone kaha ki agar raja istipha nahin de rahe he to pradhanmantri da
 Manmohan Singh should immediately remove him from his cabinet so that no obstruction can be found in the CBI investigation and all the facts can be revealed
 anjaan ne kaha ki 2 ji spectrum kaa ghotaalaa lagbhag 1

 Our emphasis is on a more broad and complex issue of how a leader chooses the great goals of his era, how to deal with the real and immediate obstacles in his path, and how he will use his political resources to achieve the goal

 He chose his broad goals long before Tharoor settled the nuclear dispute with Iran, normalized relations with Cuba and Obamacare on the domestic front

 a slightly deeper analysis of this is made
 ukraine kaa sambandh us buniyadi mudde or bhay se he jinase nibatane ke liye nato kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 The US did not have enough power to moderate the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, so at the same time he kept a distance from the issue and left it to European neighbors

 israel jis tarah america kaa sahyogi he, bharat ke paas aisa ek bhi sahyogi nahin he lekin aap kalpana karke dekhen ki agar aisa hi kuch kisi bhartiya pradhanmantri ke saath hota to ise kitne bade rashtriya or nijee apmaan ke taur par liya jaataa
 But Obama did not waste his political resources by reacting to these things
 unhone do bade faisle kiye
 One is that any effort on North Korea is better than wasting relations with its neighboring Cuba

 In the context of India and Pakistan, what will be the same as Sushma Swaraj once said — ten heads for one head — or as Rajnath Singh is saying to BSF — kill five for one? Or will it be to bring Pakistan to the table of agreement? It is for Narendra Modi to take this decision
 modi samjhaute ke paksh main hai, to unhen isaki upeksha karke rajnatik sansadhano ko bade faisle ke liye bachaana hoga
 The mandate he has got and the ideology he has, together gives him such strength that no Indian leader has had any luck till date

 yogi sarkaar ke mutabik jald hi do lakh ghar banane par kaam shuru hoga

 pehle ye film 1 disambar, 2017 ko relies hone vaali thi baad main relies date radd karke 25 janvari kar di gai
 If you look at the past records of the box office, the date of 25 January has been lucky for many films for the last two years

 The purpose and reasons of the Bill states that the Payment of Subsidy Amendment Bill 2017, inter alia, proposes to amend Section 2A of the Act to allow the government to provide women employees included in the Continuous Service Bill in place of the current 12 weeks The 'maternity leave period' should be notified
 aisa isaliye kiya gaya kyonki prasuti suvidha sanshodhan adhinium 2017 ke madhyam se prasuti chuttee kii avadhi ko 12 saptaah se badhaakar 26 saptaah kar diya gaya tha
 In such a situation, the Central Government has been asked to notify the current 12-week period for such other period
 iske tahat das lakh rupee shabd ke sthaan par ‘ek aisi rakam jo kendriya sarkaar dwaara samay samay par adhishuchet kii jaae’ shabd rakhane ke liye adhinium kii dhara 4 kaa sanshodhan karne kaa prastaav he
 Under this, it is proposed to amend section 4 of the Act to replace the term ten lakh rupees with 'a sum which may be notified by the Central Government from time to time'
 kashmir taale main band he
 There is no news of Kashmir
 shesh bharat main kashmir ko lekar jashn he
 The rest of India is not concerned with the news of Kashmir
 ek kaa daravaaza band kar diya gaya he
 One has closed the door
 jammu kashmir or ladakh kaa punargathan vidheyak pesh hota he
 Obviously it is important and historical
 rajyasabha main pesh hota he or vichaar ke liye vakt bhi nahin diya jaataa he
 As Kashmir is closed, Parliament was also closed
 par congress ne bhi aisa kiya tha isliye sabane raahat kii saans lee
 The Congress owes a lot to the BJP
 sadak par dhol nagaade baj rahe hai
 Nobody knows what has happened, how it has happened and why it has happened
 bas ek line pataa he jo varshon se pataa he
 The President gives the consent of the Governor
 rajyapal do din pehle tak kah rahe hai ki mujhe kuch nahin pataa
 Don't know what will happen tomorrow
 rajyapal centre kaa pratinidhi hota he
 The President called the opinion of the Center the opinion of the state
 sin kar diya
 Jammu Kashmir and Ladakh are no longer states
 do centre shasit pradeshon main baant diya gaya
 The post of Governor ends
 mukhyamantri kaa pad samaapt
 Political rights and identity are cut off
 itihaas ban jaataa he
 The rest of India has its own understanding of Article 370, especially in North India
 kya he or kyon he isse matlab nahin he
 It is removed and there is celebration about it
 iske do praavdhaan hate hai or ek bachaa he
 It can also be removed, but it is no longer meant
 jashn manaane waalon main ek baat saaf he
 They no longer have any faith in the rules of parliamentary procedures
 ve na nyaaypalika kii parvaah karte hai or na karypalika kii or na vidhayikaon kii
 The question of concern of the institutions has been declared dead
 log amartv ko praapt kar chuke hai
 It is not dark
 bahut tej ujaalaa he
 Sound is overpowered, sight is low
 lok ne loktantr ko kaarij kar diya he
 No need to be upset
 logon ko apane bich koi shatru mil gaya he
 Sometimes he becomes a Muslim, sometimes he becomes a Kashmiri
 nafrat ke kai code se logon kii programing kii ja chuki he
 They should just see the words related to it, their reaction spills over equally
 dhara 370 ko lekar sabane raajnneeti kii he
 Congress misused before BJP
 dhara 370 ke rahete marzi chalaai
 Neutralized him
 is khel main rajya ke raajnneetik dal bhi shaamil rahe
 Or their failures were called failure of section 370
 kashmir kii samasya ko kaaphi lapeta gaya or latakaaya gaya
 Many of those scandals happened before the bjp's arrival
 bijepi ne bhi raajnneeti kii magar khul kar kaha ki hataa denge or hataa diya
 At least 35-A was removed
 lekin kab kaha tha ki dhara 370 hataayenge to rajya hi samaapt kar denge? yah prashn to he lekin jiske liye he use isse matlab nahin he
 It was said at the time of demonetisation that the back of terror will break
 nahin tuuti
 It is expected that the situation in Kashmir will be normal this time
 ab vahaan ke logon se baatcheet kaa to prashn hi nahin
 a size sweater is woven for everyone
 pahananaa hi hoga
 The state was decided
 rajya ko pataa hi nahin
 The sting of the killing and displacement of Kashmiri Pandits is still stinging
 unki vaapasi kaa isamen kya plan he kisi ko nahin pataa
 You cannot say that there is no plan because no one knows anything
 yah wo prashn he jo sabko niruttar karata he
 Kashmiri Pandits are happy
 ghati main aaj bhi hazaron kashmiri pandit rahete hai
 a large number of Sikhs live there
 ye kaise rahete hai or itnaa kya anubhav he, kashmir ke vimarsh main inaki koi katha nahin he
 We do not know
 amit shah ne dhara 370 ko kashmir kii har samasya kaa kaaran bataa diya
 Reasons ranging from poverty to corruption
 aatank kaa to bataaya hi
 Will get employment
 factry aegi
 It seems that economic liberalization of the 1990s is coming into force
 is lihaaz se upi main bahut berojgaare he
 Now in the name of employment and factory, no one should distribute it among the five union territories! One temporary provision has been removed and another temporary provision has been brought
 amit shah ne kaha he ki halaat saamaanya honge to phir se rajya bana denge
 That is, both the union territories have not been made forever
 yah saaf nahin he ki jab halaat saamaanya honge to teenon ko waapas pehle kii sthiti main laayaa jayega yaa sirf jammu kashmir rajya banegaa
 What was the situation now that the status of the state was abolished
 ummid he kashmir main karfue kii miyaad lambii na ho
 Things should be normal
 kashmir ke logon kaa aapasi sampark tut chukaa he
 Those outside Kashmir are unable to contact their homes
 is sthiti main jashn manaane waalon kaa kalejaa bataa rahaa he ki ham kya ho chuke hai
 There is a crowd demanding whether you are welcoming or not
 khud bijepi dhara 370 ke virodh karne vaale janata dal united ke saath edjust kar rahi he
 Even after the protest, he is in government with her
 aap prakriya par sawaal uthaa den to gaali dene waalon kaa dasta tut padegaa
 There, BJP will continue to enjoy the pleasure of the post of minister in Bihar
 kashmir main zamin kareedne kii kushi he
 Other states should also be happy to remove such provisions
 un adivasee ilaaqon main jahaan paanchavi anusuchee ke tahat zamin kareedne kii bandish he vahaan bhi naaraa lag saktaa he ki jab tak yah nahin hatega bharat ek nahin hoga
 So will those who demand an India go to the northeastern states with this slogan or will it be limited to Kashmir? The way was not good, pray that the result is good
 lekin niyat thik na ho to nateeja kaise acha ho saktaa he
 Kashmir had to pay a lot for it
 shaayad kashmir ko shesh bharat kii aadhi adhuri jaankaree kaa kopbhaajan na bananaa pade
 Will it happen? Nobody knows anything
 kashmiri logon kii chintaa kii jaani chahie
 It is time to embrace them
 aap janata hai
 Someone is sending a message from among you what his daughter-in-law will do to his daughters
 agar aap vaaqai apane jashn ke prati eemaandaar hai to bataaiye is maansikta ke logon ko lekar aapkaa jashn kaise shandaar ho saktaa he?jashn manaate hue logon kaa dil bahut bada he
 They have the courage to turn away from many lies and many injustice
 tark or tathy mahatvapurn nahin he
 Yes and No is required
 log jo sunanaa chaahate hai vahi kahie
 Many people have given this noble advice
 kashmir bheed kii programing ko trigar kar saktaa he isliye chup rahane kii salaah di gai
 History is being made
 ek kaarkaanaa khulaa he
 No one knows when history comes out in it
 jahaan itihaas bana he vahaan khaamoshi he
 Where there is celebration there is no meaning from any earlier history
 jab matlab hota he to itihaas ko apane hisaab se bana lete hai
 In the House, Amit Shah said that Nehru was handling Kashmir
 sardaar patel nahin
 This is not history
 magar ab itihaas ho jayega kyonki amit shah ne kaha he
 There is no historian better than him
 note- latifa banane waalon ko bataaiye ki kashmir ek gambhir masalaa he
 There is no issue of pension
 inamen or ashleel massej bhejne waalon main koi farq nahin
 Both are not meant by the people of Kashmir
 agar nehruji dwaara banaai gai dhara 370 hat sakati hai to vaajapeyi ji dwaara thopi gai NPS kyon nahin
 Challans to be withdrawn between August and October 10 It is not clear whether the money collected as penalty will be changed by the traffic police due to the misdeeds of the two departments
 Can decide
 ye sabhi chaalaan nirdhaarit gati seemaa se zyada speed main rashtriya rajmarg sankhya-24 (ab 9) par daudane vaale vaahanon se sambandhit hai jo agast se 10 oktober ke bich kaate gaye the
 However, it has not been clear what will happen to the money due to these invoices
 dilli trephic police main sanyukt kamishnar str ke ek adhikari ne naam nahin chhapane kii shart par bataaya ki dilli trephic police kareeb dedh lakh chaalaanon ko waapas le rahi he
 These challans have been cut between about two and a half months (from August to October 10)
 in chaalaanon main zyadatar chaalaan tay seemaa se zyada speed (60 kilometre prati ghanta kii gati se zyada) main vaahan rashtriya rajmarg par daudane se sambandhit hai
 According to another officer of the Delhi Traffic Police, mostly challans over-speeding, these challans which were actually withdrawn are being used for the vehicles coming from the Nizamuddin Bridge on National Highway No
 24 (now 9) to the delhi-up (ghaziabad) border in Ghazipur
 Have been cut zyaadaatar chaalaan over-speeding ke hi hai
 Why did the traffic police have to take the decision? After all, why did the Delhi traffic police now have to withdraw these invoices? An official of the Delhi Traffic Police said that in fact, vehicles above our highway which were caught by our cameras on the highway, above the prescribed speed ie 60 kilometers per hour, were being sent e-challans
 baad main shikaayatein aani shuru huin ki haive par peedblyoody vibhaag ne nirdhaarit gati seemaa 70 kilometre prati ghanta ke sin board laga rakhe hai
 According to this senior officer of Delhi Traffic Police, the traffic police had been asking PWD for a long time to change the signboard
 matlab adhiktam 70 kilometre prati ghanta kii speed vaale pehle se lage hue sin board badalakar nirdhaarit gati seemaa 60 kilometre prati ghanta kar de lekin kaaphi prayaason ke baad bhi jab sin board nahin badale gaye, to janhit main dilli trephic police ne kareeb dedh lakh chaalaan waapas lene kii yojana banaai
 Simultaneously, a maximum speed limit of 70 km per hour has also been fed to those cameras of Delhi Traffic Police, which record the speed of vehicles on and off the national highway
 website se hatenge i-chaalaandilli trephic police ke disipi str ke ek adhikari ne kaha ki jin vaahan chaalkon ke i-chaalaan cat chuke hai, unhen trephic police apni bevesite se hataa legi
 But this move of the traffic police raises the question that till now, those who have deposited the amount of crores of 'online' challans to Delhi Government through Delhi Traffic Police, how will it be refunded? There is no proper answer to this question of any top officer of Delhi Traffic Police
 kanoonee pench main funsane ke dar se liya faisla?duusari ore, dilli trephic police dwaara uthaae gaye is avishwasaneey kadam ko lekar sutara bataate hai ki achaanak dedh lakh chaalaan waapas lene kaa faisla trephic police ne yun hi nahin liya he
 The traffic police had realized from somewhere that some drivers are preparing to take this issue in front of the Hoi court as a public interest litigation
 trephic polisake saamne jaise hi kanoonee rup se khud kii gardan fansati najar ai, usne aanan-fanan main janhit kaa khyaal aa gaya or usne vakt ganvaae bina ek dam dedh lakh chaalaan waapas lene kaa nirnay le liya
 Delhi Traffic Police has installed around 24 new cameras in the national capital in the past few days to deal with red light jumpers and vehicle speed limit laws
 ye camere jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay, aiesabiti, nelson mandela maarg, agast kranti maarg, bhalswa-wazirabad road, dilli-noida-dilli flive, jiti karnal road par lagaae gaye hai
 On the other hand, statistics show that 17 states have been implementing it since the Union Ministry of Road Transport has developed (since 2017) e-challanapp
 enaisi dwaara viksit kiye gaye is i-chaalaan ap ke jariye desh main kareeb do hajaar teen sau karod rupee kaa rajasav sirf yatayaat niyamon kaa ulanghan karne waalon se hi vasula / jamaa karavaaya ja chukaa he
 To end China's growing influence in Asia, India has decided to sell brahmos supersonic cruise missile to Vietnam
 raksha mantri manohar parrikar singapore or vietnam kii paanch divasiy yatra par jaaenge
 During this time, a final decision on this deal is likely
 parrikar kii yatra ke dauraan ve brahmos missile ko lekar charchaa karenge
 Vietnam has been seeking brahmos missile for the last five years
 lekin pichhali upie sarkaar nechin kii aapattiyonke dar se vietnam ko yah missile nahin di thi
 This decision is being considered as a major change in the foreign policy of the Modi government
 raksha mantralay ke sutron ke mutabik pradhanmantri narendra modi or raksha mantri ne iske liye manjuuri de di he
 Explain that brahmos missile is developed by India and Russia together
 yah sabase taqatvar mixilon main se ek he
 India has grown up with China on several issues recently with China
 pakistan main maujuud aatanki ajahar masood ko yuan se bain karaane kii bharat kii koshishon ko china ne vifal kar diya tha
 Apart from this, China also tried to impede the efforts of India's entry into the Nuclear Suppliers group-nsg

 buudhvaar ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne uttar pradesh ke aligarh main booth adhyaksh sammelan ko sambodhit kiya or is dauraan unhone congress par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also addressed the booth workers
 amit shah ne kaha bijepi duusare dalon se alag party he
 It is not the election leader but the booth worker

 But now the goons are roaming around to arrest me
 maine kaha tha ki bhoomafia ko ulta lataka duungaa
 We have rescued thousands of hectares of land from SP-BSP goons
 unhone kaha ki desh kii suraksha ke liye puraani sarkarein sanjeeda nahin thim
 The terrorists felt that nothing would happen after Uri, but Modi ji's government was there, not Mouni Baba Manmohan's government

 i ask what is the stand of SP-BSP and Congress? UP CM Yogi Adityanath said that there is very little time left in the Lok Sabha elections
 pradhanmantri modi kii sarkaar ne desh ko nai disha di he
 Once again Modi ji's government should be formed

 He said that we did not see any caste, region and religion

 The opposition is forging an alliance against the BJP, for the insecurity of sisters and daughters, for rioting
 unhone kaha ki aligarh vishvavidhyalay ko anudaan centre sarkaar detii he
 Why do SC and ST youth not get reservation in Aligarh University? sapa-basapa or congress apana mat bataaen
 bjp's UP in-charge JP Nadda, Union Minister Maneka Gandhi, UP Energy Minister Shrikant Sharma were also present on the dais in Aligarh, Western Uttar Pradesh
 bhima koregaanv hinsa se jude maamle main vampanthi vichaarkon or maanavadhikaar kaaryakartaaon ko pune police ne giraftaar kiya he
 But after this arrest, the biggest question that arises is why no action has been taken against Sambhaji Bhide, the main accused in this case

 amit shah mishan 2019 ke maddenjar takreeban 100 dinon ke rashtravyapee daure par nikal gaye hai
 In this episode, he is going on a three-day Kerala tour from Friday after Tripura, West Bengal
 darasal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar bijepi un rajyon par adhik focus karnaa chaahati he jahaan pichhali baar uskaa pradarshan kamjor rahaa tha
 There are states like Kerala, West Bengal, Telangana in this episode
 amit shah in rajyon main bijepi ko majboot karne kii koshishen kar rahe hai
 One big reason for this is that last time BJP won more than 280 seats mostly from Hindi speaking states
 jaankaron ke mutabik is baar bijepi kii ranneeti yah he ki yadi party ko hindi bhashi rajyon main satta virdohi lahar kaa kuch khamiyaja bhugatna padaa to vah uski bharpai gaiyr hindi rajyon main apni pahunch badhaakar karnaa chaahati he
 That is why, during his three-month tour, Amit Shah will focus on strengthening the party and organization in non-hindi states where the BJP is relatively weak
 kerala ke baad amit shah telugana or lakshadweep ke daure par jaaenge or uske baad agast main andhra pradesh jaaenge
 The comments darasal shah chaahate hai ki uttar-purv rajyon, pashchim bengal, tamilnadu, kerala, telugana, aandh pradesh jaise rajyon main bijepi zyada siten jite, lekin maweshiyon ke kaarobaar par centre sarkaar kii haalia adhisuchana kaa in sabhi rajyon main jabardast virodh kiya ja rahaa he
 The state governments of West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura have spoken of not implementing it
 isi prishthbhumi main amit shah kerala ja rahe hai
 There is a lot of opposition to this notification
 meghalaya main bijepi netaaon ne hi iskaa virodh kiya he or rajya ke ek varisht netaa ne is adhisuchana ke virodh main istipha bhi de diya he
 bjp's ally NPP protested against this and demanded intervention from PM Modi
 jabaki tamilnadu main vipakshi dal diemke ne iske khilaaf aawaaj uthaai he
 Significantly, there are many states in which cow slaughter is not banned and beef is a part of people's diet
 haalanki bijepi netaaon kaa maananaa he ki jis tarah se yuva congress kaaryakartaaon ne kerala main chauraahey par bachade kii hatya kii usase hindi bhashi rajyon main congress ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 BJP is preparing to make this a big issue
 is saal gujarat or himachal pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav hone ja rahe hai
 This is the reason that Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani reacted immediately to this incident
 lekin yah bhi sahi he ki gaiyr hindi rajyon aise rajyon main jahaan bijepi apni upasthiti badhanaa chaahati he vahaan maweshiyon ke kaarobaar se sambandhit adhisuchana ke baad amit shah ko ab zyada mehnat kerani padegi

 Actually Shah wants BJP to win more seats in states like north-east, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, but the recent notification of the Central Government on the trade of cattle is being strongly opposed in all these states
 
 pashchim bengal, kerala or tripura rajya sarkaron ne ise lagu na karne kii baat kahi he
 In the same background, Amit Shah is going to Kerala

 She is referring to the closure report in the Supreme Court by the end of July
 mana ja rahaa he ki yah sarkaar or mulaayam ke bich ek haath le duusare haath de kaa maamla he
 The government needs Mulayam's support on the food bill
 mulaayam singh yadav philhal congress ke liye jaruri hai
 The important bet of the 2014 election board is to be decided by his hand
 kya isiilie sibiai unke khilaaf chal rahaa cese band karne kii soch rahi he
 This question is because this is the fourth time when the CBI has overturned Mulayam
 sabase pehle 2007 main sibiai ne mulaayam ke khilaaf maamla banane kii baat kahi
 - On 1 March 2007, the Supreme Court asked the CBI to investigate the disproportionate assets case against Mulayam
 - 26 oktober 2007 ko sibiai ne supreme court ko bataaya ki mulaayam ke khilaaf pehali najar main maamla banataa he
 Therefore, he should be allowed to register an FIR
 lekin, salbhar baad hi sibiai ne pehali palati maarthe hue apana rukh badal liya
 He directly acceded to government pressure
 - 6 disambar 2008 ko sibiai ne adaalat ko bataaya ki centre sarkaar ne use praathmik report waapas lene ko kaha he
 - On 10 February 2009, the Supreme Court reserved its decision in this case ye vah daur tha jab centre sarkaar ko mulaayam ne vishwasamat hasil karne main madad kii thi
 But as the march progressed, the CBI took another turn
 30 march 2009 ko usne kaha ki vah apane mul rukh par kaayam he
 But, the last three years have been years of political forced friendship between the central government and Mulayam
 isliye sibiai ko teesri baar palati maarani pad rahi he
 This time, he argues, the increase in income of Mulayam and Akhilesh is visible due to debt
 dilachasp yah he ki sibiai ke mutabik yah karj unke rishtedaaron ne tohfe ke taur par unhen die
 The comments lekin, yachikakarta vishwanath chaturvedi kaa kahana he ki abhi to uski gavaahi tak nahin hui he
 It is believed that the government also wants to close the matter because it needs Mulayam's support on the food security bill

 It is believed that it is a matter of taking one hand and the other hand between the government and Mulayam

 - On 26 October 2007, the CBI told the Supreme Court that a prima facie case is made against Mulayam
 isliye use exiaar darj karne kii ijaajat di jaae
 However, only a year later, the CBI changed its stand with the first reversal
 usne sidhe−sidhe sarkari dabaav kii baat maan lee
 - On 6 December 2008, the CBI told the court that the Central Government has asked it to withdraw the primary report
 - 10 farvari 2009 ko supreme court ne is maamle main apana faisla surakshit rakhaa This was the period when Mulayam helped the central government to gain the confidence
 magar march aate−aate sibiai ne duusari palati maari
 On 30 March 2009, he stated that he stood by his original position
 lekin, pichley teen saal centre sarkaar or mulaayam ke bich raajnneetik majaburiyon vaali dosti ke saal rahe hai
 That is why the CBI has to retaliate for the third time
 is baar uskaa tark he, mulaayam or akhilesh kii aay main hui badhotaree karj ke kaaran dikh rahi he
 Interestingly, according to the CBI, this loan was given to him by his relatives as gifts

 mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar yah maamla isliye bhi band karana chaahati he ki use khaadya suraksha bill par mulaayam kaa samarthan chahie

 ek iees afasar kaa sawaal poochna chhattisgarh kii bijepi sarkaar ko 6
 It fell to 5 crores rupees
 darasal, is afasar ne apni fasebuk wal par sawaal kiya tha ki dinadayal upaadhyaay koun hai or unka desh ke prati yogadan kya rahaa he
 Instead of answering this question, the state government printed a book on Deendayal Upadhyaya
 chhattisgarh cader ke varsh 2012 batch ke iees adhikari shiv anant tayal ne kareeb chaar maah pehle apni fasebuk waal main ye sawaal post kiya tha
 The BJP government of the state went through this exasperation
 tayal us vakt kanker jila panchayat ke siio pad par tainaat the
 He was transferred from there and attached to the ministry
 is ghatana ke chaar maheene baad ab pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay ke upar likhi 10,971 pannon kii kitaab jaldi hi gram panchayaton kii raunak badhaane vaali he
 The state Panchayat Department has spent an amount of six and a half crores from the government treasury to publish a fifteen-volume book based on the lifestyle character and ideology of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay
 kitaab ko chhapavane main itani jaldbaaji dikhaai gai ki naa to iske liye tender bulaayaa gaya or naa hi saarvajanik soochna jari kii gai
 Now these books will be delivered to all gram panchayats of the state
 congress ne is kitaab ko chhapavaaye jane main bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaate hue rajya sarkaar ko katghare main khadaa kiya he
 According to Ramesh Verlani, the party's vice president in the state, there has been a huge flaw in the publication of the book
 varlyani kaa kahana he- 'digital indiaper itnaa jor diya ja rahaa he to is kitaab ko i-book kii shakl dekar gaanv-gaanv main pahunchaa sakati thi
 By not doing so, the government left the task of publication of the book to the authorities
 adhikariyon ne bina tender bulaae jo janata ke paise kaa durupyog kiya, uski vasuuli unheen se kii jaani chahie
 'let us tell you that the state government is in the question of not only about the book on Deen Dayal Upadhyaya but also about the expenditure on his birth anniversary
 jayanti se jude samaaroh par hone vaala 13 karod rupye kii anumaanit rakam bhi panchayaton kii moolbhoot vikaas raashi se kharch kii jaaegi
 However, it is clear in the Panchayat Act that the basic amount of Panchayat can be spent only on development schemes and not in the name of a great man
 rajya sarkaar ne panchayaton ke vikaas nidhi ke fund se hi saadhe chha karod kii rakampandit dinadayal upadhyay par aadhaarit pustakachhapavane main kharch kar di
 Explanation of the matter is now being given by the government
 sarkari pravaktaa shrichand sundarani kaa kahana he ki hamaara uddeshy yahi he ki pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay ke vichaaro se ham desh-pradesh kii janata ko avgat karaae, agar kahin koi aniyamitata hui he to nishchit rup se niyamanusaar karrwai hogi
 In Chhattisgarh, the Torman Singh government claims that it adopts zero tolerance policy on corruption
 lekin is kitaab ko chhapavane kii niyam prakriya ko lekar naa to vibhaag pramukh kuch bolne ko taiyaar he or naa hi mantri
 There is a rule in the state to issue tenders for any kind of expenditure of more than 50 thousand rupees or for horse trading
 phir is maamle main pichley daravaaje se aakhir kyon kitaab ke prakaashan ke order jari kiye gaye
 This is the big question on which the state government has kept silence

 7 janvari 2020 tak mili rahatprahalada lodhine vishesh court ke faisle ko hai court main chunauti di thi jisapar guuruuvaar ko sunwaayee karte hue hai court main lodhi ko raahat dete hue sajaa par 7 janvari 2020 tak liye roak laga di he
 At the same time, BJP State President Rakesh Singh's statement on the matter of giving relief to BJP MLA Prahlad Lodhi from Powai from High Court has also come out
 hai court ke faisle ke baad bhopal main patrakaron se baat karte hue rakesh singh ne kaha, 'bijepi vidhayak prahlada lodhi kii sadsyta khatm karne kaa faisla rajnatik dwesh se liya gaya tha
 The Congress had taken advantage of its lot
 ' rakesh singh ne kaha, 'vidhansabha ke adhyaksh ke dwaara jis tarah se jaldbaaji main, jis hadabadi main sadsyta samaapt kii thi uske dwaara naa sirf madhya pradesh main balki desh main yah sandesh gaya tha ki kis tarah se raajnneetik dwesh main samaapt kii
 'he said,' Without the permission of the Governor and without the permission of the High Court, the Madhya Pradesh Assembly Speaker hastily announced his termination of membership

 But decisions are not made in this way

 For this, he used Madhya Pradesh Assembly Speaker as a tool, which is unfortunate

 Since the formation of the state, students in government primary schools have reduced to less than 50 percent
 shiksha mantri arvind pandey ne das yaa isse kam chaatro vaale skulon ko najdiki vidyalayon main milaane kaa aadesh jari kiya he or vibhaag iske paalan kii ruparekha banane main juta he
 The issue of declining student numbers in primary and upper primary schools also arose in a meeting of teachers' organizations with state Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat
 iske baad ravat ne kam chaatro vaale praathmik or ucch praathmik vidyalayon ko najdiki skool main villin karne ke nirdesh die
 There are 15,428 primary schools in Uttarakhand
 inamen sarkari praathmik vidyalayon main 5,56,000 se zyada chaatr padhate hai
 While adding the number of children from government aided schools, this number rises to 10,50,000
 donon mandalon main 2,430 aise praathmik vidhyalay hai jinamein bacchon kii sankhya 10 se kam he
 The number of schools with less than ten children in Garhwal division itself is 1,365
 jabaki kumaun mandal main aise vidyalayon kii sankhya lagbhag 1,065 he
 Pandey has announced the closure of schools with low student numbers
 jo primary skool band honge unke vidhyaarthiyon ko aas-paas ke gaanv ke vidyalayon main samyojit kiya jayega
 Earlier, the then Education Minister Prasad Naithani made a similar announcement during his tenure
 jis par amal nahin ho paaya tha
 Additional Education Director S
 Department of Elementary Education in Garhwal Division
 pi
 Khali says that there are 1,365 primary schools, including the five hilly districts of Garhwal division, including Dehradun, Haridwar, where the number of students is less than ten
 sabase kharaab sthiti paudi main he, jahaan 540 sarkari praathmik vidhyalay sankat main hai, to tehri main bhi 304 skool aise hai jahaan chaatr sankhya das se kam he
 Chamoli also has the same condition
 sarkari praathmik or ucch praathmik vidyalayon main chaatr sankhya main har saal giravat aa rahi he
 The declining number of students is being reviewed according to Khali
 november ke ant tak yah tay hoga ki inamen se kitne skulon ko band kiya jaae
 Schools with no students have locks
 lekin duusari ore, skulon ko smart banane kaa bhi prayaas ho rahaa he or jin skulon ko smart banaaya gaya he, vahaan chaatr bad rahe hai, khaali ke anusaar, shikshak bhi vidhyaarthiyon kii sankhya badhaane kaa abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 It is also expected to improve student numbers to some extent
 vaise chaatr sankhya ghatane kaa mukhya kaaran gaanvon se palaayan he
 In Garhwal, people are either in Kotdwar or Dehradun on the mountain and in the vicinity of settling in and around
 adhikansh aabaadi ke palaayan se yah sthiti bani he
 In many places, parents are teaching children in private schools, so government schools are being vacated
 lekin smart schooling se sthitiyon par kaabo paaya ja saktaa he
 The government has ordered schools with ten or less student numbers to be merged as per the RTE standard, in the event of primary schools being available within a distance of one kilometer
 shashan ne nideshaalay se vilay kii karrwai se pehle aise skulon ko chihnit karne ko kaha he
 The plight of primary education in Uttarakhand can also be gauged from the fact that while the number of children studying is decreasing, on the other hand, in many places there are more than two teachers at very low student numbers
 rajya main 77 vidhyalay aise hai, jahaan par 20 se kam chaatr sankhya par do se adhik shikshak tainaat hai
 According to RTE 2009 standards, primary schools have two teachers in schools with student numbers up to 60, three on numbers from 61 to 90, four on 91 to 120, five on 121 to 150 and above on student numbers
 There is a provision to deploy more teachers
 adhikariyon kaa tark he ki in vidyalayon main karyrat shikshakon kii padonnati, sthanantaran, sevanivritti aadi ke kaaran har saal chaatr-shikshak anupaat prabhavit ho rahaa he
 After 17 years of state formation, comparatively the expenditure on education increased but the quality went down
 2001 main shiksha par kharch 6
 74 billion Rs
 tha jo ab 61 arab ru
 Has reached praathmik shiksha main bacchon kii sankhya main pachaas fisad tak kami ai he
 Not only this, even at the upper primary level, the number of children has been reduced to 67,000
 isaki vajah yah he ki sarkari skulon ke parinaam se niraash abhibhavak bacchon ko nijee skulon main bhejnaa pasand karte hai
 Government schools in New Tehri and Pauri are constantly under lock
 jile main pichley shiksha satr main 18 skool band ho chuke hai
 As many as 73 schools have been closed so far due to zero student numbers in the district
 479 vidyalayon main das yaa isse kam chaatr rah gaye hai
 Of these 152 schools, the number of students has been reduced from one to five
 paudi main shunya chaatr sankhya vaale sarkari primary skulon kii sankhya badhkar 229 ho gai he
 There were 1,473 primary schools in Tehri, but 38 have been closed since the last academic session
 tehri main 273 praathmik skool 10 se kam chaatr hone ke chalate band hone ke kagaar par hai
 The data from the 2014 Annual Status of Education report underscores this plight
 report ke anusaar, uttarakhand ke sarkari skulon ke kaksha aath tak ke kareeb 42 fisadi bachche shabd tak thik se nahin pard pate
 Children of the sixth, seventh, and eighth are not able to do the usual addition and subtraction
 pahari ilaakon ke kai vidhyalay ekal shikshakon ke bharose chal rahen hai
 Thirty percent of the schools do not have toilets and 56 percent do not have separate toilets for girls
 30 fisadi main pine ke pani kii vyavastha tak nahin he
 54 per cent of the schools in the mountain area facing wild animal terror have no security boundary
 puskalay keval 37 fisadi skulon main he
 This is the reason why people's trust in government education is not being restored
 kumaun mandal main to kai vidyalayon ke bhawan bhi jarjar hai
 There are 12 buildings in Almora, 62 in Bageshwar, 37 in Nainital, six in Pithoragarh, 21 in Champawat and 52 in Udhamsingh Nagar

 Because of this we are in a strong position
 unhone kaha ki vrihad aarthik morche par mahangaai or anya dikkatein nahin hai
 Sanyal said that due to better foreign exchange reserves, the fall in the rupee will not affect us much
 isliye ham aisi sthiti main rupee ko girane de sakate hai
 He told that many emerging economies have allowed their currency to fall in view of the circumstances of the trade war that is being born

 Delhi Police has arrested one such person who used to go on walls like Spiderman and carry out the crimes of theft
 is chor nedillike logon kii naak main to dam kar hi rakhaa tha, saath hi police ko bhi ye kai dinon se chakma de rahaa tha
 The thief would put a mask on his face at night and climb on people's car and upon entering, he entered the house like Spiderman
 kuch hi der main ye waapas aata he or pehle se bhi zyada furti ke saath palak jhapakate hi faraar ho jaataa
 Actually, there were several cases of theft in South East Delhi areas, but the police failed to catch the thief
 police ko shikaayat mili ki govindpuri ilaake main ek ghar main chor ghusaa tha, lekin ghar main maujuud mahila ke chillane par chor faraar ho gaya

 input: bhashaa More than seven months have passed since Xiaomi's Redmi 6 series was launched in India
 ab waterdrop noch or gradient finnish vaale smartphone popular ho rahe hai, is vazah se pratiddhandi companiyaan apane nae smartphone par kaaphi kaam kar rahi hai
 Xiaomi is not the only company fighting in the market for smartphones with better specifications and features at a lower price
 Samsung kii nai e-series or em-series bhi kam keemat main kadi takkar detii he
 Sales of the new Samsung series have been very good since launch
 Xiaomi ne ab 8,000 rupee se kam ke price segment main ek nae smartphone ko utaara he
 Xiaomi Redmi 7 is an all-rounder smartphone that everyone may like
 isamen har wo baat he jo graahak ko chahie hoti he
 The interesting thing is that Xiaomi has not yet launched its companion model Redmi 7 Pro or Redmi 7A
 is rivyuu main hamane redmy 7 (redmi 7) par apana dhyaan kendrit kiya he, aaie jaanate hai ki shaomi brands kaa yah phone Samsung, Honor, Realme or anya pratidwandvi companiyon ke smartphone se aage he yaa nahin?xiaomi ke zyaadaatar puraane smartphone kaa luk ek samaan lagata tha lekin Redmi 7 ko nae dizine ke saath market main utaara gaya he
 In Redmi 7, Xiaomi has not used the metallic look given in Redmi 6
 in dinon ke trend main bane rahete hue multi-color glouci plastic par bharosa jataayaa gaya he
 Redmi 7 has three color variants - Eclipse Black, Lunar Red and Comet Blue

 embed-container embed {position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } hamaare paas rivyuu ke liye iklips blike color verient maujuud he
 Let us know that both Lunar Red and Comet Blue come with Smartphone Gradient Rear Panel, Xiaomi has given it the name of Aura Smoke Design
 comet blue verient ke pichley hisse par dark purple or brit blue rang kaa gradient finnish he
 On the other hand, in the Lunar Red variant, the upper part of the back panel is black and the lower part is in red color
 agar aapako in donon verient main die gradient finnish pasand nahin he to aap retail box main aane vaale dark translucent plastic cover kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 Nowadays smartphones are being launched with large display panels and this includes the name of Redmi 7
 yaad kara den ki Redmi 6 main 5
 There was a 45-inch display, so now the Redmi 7 6
 26 inch kii screen ke saath utaara gaya he
 In all dimensions, Redmi 7 is a bigger smartphone than the Redmi 6 and is also heavier
 redmy 7 kaa vazan 180 gram or motaai 8
 It is 47 millimeters, after putting the phone in the pocket, you will feel the heaviness when walking
 sirf haath ke anguuthe se screen ke har kinare tak pahunchnaa aasaan nahin he
 The low-cost Redmi 7 comes with Modern 'dot' notch, but if you are looking for a phone with no bezel, then it does not fit according to your expectation
 acchhee baat yah he ki shaomi (xiaomi) ne Redmi 7 main corning gorilla glass 5 kaa istemaal kiya he
 The back panel of the phone is made of molded plastic finished with nano-spray
 hamaare paas rivyuu ke liye maujuud unit glouci or zyada riflactive he
 Within a few moments of taking the phone out of the retail box, it had fingerprints and spots
 hamane notice kiya ki phone ke pichley hisse par dhul or fibre ke chote kan chipak jate hai, aise main Redmi 7 ko nayaa jaisaa rakh paanaa asambhav he
 After carefully using the smartphone for less than a week, we noticed scratch marks on the phone
 glouci rier panel mat plastic frem se bane ez par aakar miltaa he lekin yah purnatah rup se smooth nahin he
 The fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone and the power and volume buttons on the right side are easily accessible
 front camere ke thik upar patale yearpis ko jagah mili he or sensor chhipe hue hai
 a small LED light has been given at the bottom border of the phone, which burns when the phone is charging and turns off when the battery is full
 back panel par diya dual-camera modul dikhne main thodaa chota lagata he
 3 you at the top of the phone
 5 millimetre headphone jaik or aplyansej ko control karne ke liye infrared emetre milegaa
 On the left side of the phone, there is a single tray, in which two nano-sim and microsd card can be fitted, which is quite a good thing
 phone ke nichle hisse main do gril hai lekin isamen se ek spikar he
 It would have been nice to have a USB type-c port
 lekin keemat ko dekhte hue micro-yuasabi port se koi shikaayat nahin he
 If you like big smartphones then you will find Redmi 7 attractive compared to Redmi 6, the thing to note is that the initial price of both is the same
 redmy 7 main 1
 The 8 ghz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 processor has been used, meaning you will get a more capable chipset in this smartphone
 yaad kara den ki Redmi 6 mediatech helio pi22 procesar or redmy 6 pro (redmi 6 Pro) snapadragon 625 procesar se las he
 The Adreno 506 GPU has been used for graphics in Redmi 7
 Xiaomi ne bharat main Redmi 7 ke do verient utaare hai, donon hi verient 32 jibi storage se las hai
 The only difference is that the base variant comes with 2 GB RAM, which is priced at Rs 7,999 in the Indian market
 vahiin, iske 3 jibi ram verient kii keemat 8,999 rupee he
 This strategy of the company seemed a bit odd
 agar aap apane bajet ko 1,000 rupee badha sakate hai to Redmi Note 7 (rivyuu) smartphone mil jayega
 At the same time, both variants of Redmi 6 were 3 GB RAM
 ek main 32 jibi storage thi jiskaa daam 7,999 rupee he, 1,500 rupee zyaada kharchakar 64 jibi storage vaala verient mil jayega
 6 in Redmi 7
 26 inch echdi+ (720x1520 picksal) disple he, iskaa aspect reshio 19:9 he
 Xiaomi said that in this low-priced phone, you will get 84 percent NTSC color gamut

 Samsung Galaxy M20 ko rivyuu karte vakt hamen kuch blatent vigyaapan or behatar-dizine vaale snipats dekhne ko mili the lekin yah bahut hi pareshaan karne vaale the

 The base variant of Redmi 7 is slightly cheaper than the 3 GB RAM variant
 miyuai (MIUI) main vigyaapan ke alaava Redmi 7 ko istemaal karne aasaan he
 Sometimes the phone slowed down a little while calling and while scrolling in the app switcher
 phone main ek ajeeb si samasya bhi he, kabhi-kabhi notification jhat se gaayab ho jaataa he jis vazah se ise pard paanaa asambhav he
 The screen is a bit reflective but its quality is good

 Colors and viewing angles appear correctly in the phone but it is a bit difficult to read on the screen in sunlight
 ham spikar se kaaphi prabhavit hue, yah bina distorshan ke tej awaz detaa he
 But you won't get much bass
 phone ke saath aapako hedset bhi nahin milegaa
 On the Google Play store you will see that Asphalt 9: Legends is not compatible with the phone, so we could not test it
 PUBG Mobile difolt main medium settings par chalaa

 Overall, due to the features and specifications in this price, the claim of this phone of Xiaomi seems to be stronger
 lekin phone main software anubhav khaas taur par vigyaapan logon ko kaaphi niraash kar saktaa he

 The entire opposition, including the Congress, has been in the center for some time in the Rafale deal
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or rakshaamantri nirmala sitaraman par desh se jhooth bolne or deal main bhrashtachar karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Now the official statement of Indian Air Force has come on this deal for the first time

 The central government is providing us Rafale fighter aircraft today

 congress kaa aarope he ki is nai deal main kisi bhi tarah kii technology ke transfar kii baat nahin hui he
 According to former Defense Minister AK Antony, according to the deal of the UPA government, 18 out of 126 aircraft were to be built in France and the rest were to be built in India by HAL

 According to him "sachin changed his statement repeatedly
 pehle unhone kaha ki wo nahin sun paae ki harbhajan ne symonds se kya kaha kyonki ve kaaphi dur the or yah sach bhi he lekin duusari sunwaayee main sachin ne baat badalte hue kaha ki harbhajan ne symonds ko hindi main kuch kaha tha

 gilcrist to yahaan tak kehane se nahin chuke ki sachin haarane ke baad khel bhaavana bhul jate hai, sidney test kaa hawala dete hue unka kahana tha ki
 "when we went to the Indian dressing room to shake hands after losing to India, it was not Sachin
 harbhajan bhi vahaan par nahin the
 This is probably a difference of culture

 Such is also the problem with Cricket Sri Lanka, which denied use of the technique against Australia, but later agreed

 ' bharat ke parmaanu bhedbhaav ko samaapt karne kaa rasta taiyaar karne vaale bahucharchit parmaanu daayitv vidheyak ko loksabhaa ne buudhvaar ko apni manjuuri de di
 The lower house approved the bill by voice, rejecting all opposition amendments and accepting government amendments in the division of votes on this bill
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne vidheyak par hui charchaa main hastkshep karte hue kaha, ‘yah vidheyak bharat ke khilaaf dashakon se chale aa rahe parmaanu bhedbhaav kii yatra ko samaapt kar degaa
 He today dismissed the allegations that this was done to serve the interests of America or its companies
 ‘yah kahana ekadam galat he ki is vidheyak ke jariye bharat ke hiton se samjhauta kiya gaya he
 After several days of controversy and deadlock over the bill, the government introduced new amendments to the bill in the light of the objections of the opposition parties and took various parties, including the main opposition BJP, into confidence, after which the bill was passed
 singh ne 1992 main congress sarkaar main vitt mantri ke rup main pesh kiye gaye apane bajet kaa ullekh karte hue kaha ki us samay bhi kuch apwaad ko chhodkar vipakshi netaaon ne un par yah kah kar mahabhiyog chalaane tak kii baat kii thi ki unke dwaara banaaya gaya vah bajet america main taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 He said that NDA President LK Advani, present in the House, has been a witness to this fact
 unhen ye baat yaad hogi
 Singh said, the process of this agreement started in 1999
 maine tab ke kagajaat dekhe hai
 All our experts and scientists believed that there was a need to end the ongoing nuclear discrimination against India
 ’ vidheyak kii joardaar vakaalat karte hue pradhanmantri ne parmaanu urja ko vyavhaarik vikalp bataate hue kaha ki is vidheyak ke dwaara bharat vishwa ke saath parmaanu vaanijya ke apane vikalpon kaa or vistaar karegaa
 On the plea of adopting heat and hydro power options instead of nuclear, he said that all studies show that this option has limitations and nuclear power cannot be ignored
 parmaanu durghatnaon ke sandarbh main sadasyon kii ashankaon par pradhanmantri ne kaha ki bharat main ek bhi parmaanu durghatana nahin hui he or iskaa puraa shrey hamaare vaigyanikon ko jaataa he
 "despite this, i assure that no effort will be left to ensure nuclear safety and the nuclear energy regulatory board will be further strengthened and ensure it through the Nuclear Safety Board," he said
 parmaanu praudyogiki ke mahangi hone ke sandarbh main unhone kaha ki praudyogiki kaa teji se vikaas ho rahaa he or bhavishya ke garbh main kya chipa he, kisi ko nahin pataa
 But we want to open the way to all options for the development of India
 manmohan singh ne kaha ki hamaari sarkaar bhavishya ke sabhi vikalpon ko desh ke vikaas ke liye kholana chaahati he
 It was proposed to amend the 17 (B) clause in the original form of the bill which was strongly criticized by the BJP and the Left parties
 isamen durghatana kii sthiti main muaavje kaa daawa karne kii sthiti main aapurtikarta ke iraade ko sabit karne kii baat kahi gai thi
 The government introduced a new amendment to the original bill stating that the 17 (b) clause no longer contains the word 'willful' and instead replaces a nuclear accident caused by a substandard or faulty equipment, material or service, in view of the work of the supplier or its employees
 Ho 'is placed

 Later, responding to the discussion on the Bill, Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office Prithviraj Chavan said that during the Prime Minister's visit to America in 2005, an agreement was made to resolve this problem but there is no nuclear liability law in this direction
 There was a shortage from the US because 28 of the 30 nuclear power producing countries have such legislation
 keval bharat or pakistan main aisa koi kanoon nahin he
 He said that we have had extensive discussions with all opposition parties, experts and all parties in preparing the bill and after 18 amendments in the original bill in this direction, it has been introduced today in which the suggestions of parties like BJP, Left parties and SP Has been included
 ’ chavaan ne kaha vam dalon ko abhi bhi kuch chintaaen hai lekin main unhen bataanaa chahta hum ki yah kisi bhi desh kii madad ke liye nahin he
 We are a big country and we have to understand our needs
 yah jarurat bijli kii samasya ko dur karne kii he
 The minister said that through the revised form of the bill, there is a provision of adequate compensation to third parties (victims) in the event of any accident, in the absence of which the government had to step up in the case of Bhopal gas tragedy and the victims were in trouble
 unhone kaha is vidheyak main aapurtikartaaon, upabhoktaaon, sarkaar, diziner aadi sabhi pakshon kii javabdehi tay kii gai he
 In the event of a nuclear accident, the maximum compensation amount has been increased to Rs 1,500 crore from the earlier 500 crore rupees, which is similar to the compensation given in the US in such cases
 ’ chavaan ne kaha ki pokharan main pehle parmaanu pareekshan ke baad parmaanu aapurtikarta deshon kii ore se praudyogiki ke hastantaran par lagaayi gai pabandi ko samaapt karne kaa hamaara prayaas is kshetra main aatmanirbharta hasil karne ke liye he
 "we have specialized in complete fuel cycle, reactor design, power generation and waste recycling, but some technologies are still not available with us," he said

 Earlier, bjp's Jaswant Singh said that the haste that the government has brought this bill raises doubts about the intention of the government
 yah kah kar main kisi kii chhavi ko kharaab karne kaa prayaas nahin kar rahaa hum lekin isse aisa sandesh ja rahaa he ki november main america raashtrapati baraak obama kii bharat yatra ke dabaav ke kaaran kiya ja rahaa he
 'janata Dal uk's Sharad Yadav alleged that the haste shown by the government in bringing the bill will cost the country very much in the coming times
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar is vidheyak ko paarit karaane kaa ek rasta nikaal chuki he or unki virodh karne kii haisiyat nahin he, isliye vah is par adhik kuch nahin bolnaa chaahate
 Opposing the bill, Marxist Basudev Acharya said that there is no limit on compensation amount in countries like Japan, South Korea and the same should be the case with India

 The company, however, made it clear that Dhoni was a shareholder for only a short time and he currently has no stake in the company
 saavant ne kaha, 'dhoni jab captain hai tab unhen turant swayan ko prabandhan company se alag kar lenaa chahie
