 Independence Day Deshbhakti Geet: Independence Day (independence Day) is a day on which every Indian feels proud
 is baar puraa desh 73waan swatantraaa diwas (73rd Independence Day) manaa rahaa he
 On this day in 1947, India got independence from the British rule and Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the country waved the Indian Flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort
 swatantraaa diwas (independence Day) kii kai kahaniyaan hamen bollywood filmon ke jariye bhi dekhne ko mili hai
 Apart from this, many such songs have been filmed in Bollywood, which not only makes one feel proud to hear, but sometimes also makes the hair of people stand up
 iske alaava bollywood ke kai aise bhi gane hai, jiske jariye logon ko aazaadee kii gaatha bhi sunne ko milti he
 It is the first such revolutionary song which has killed the British rule
 aazaadee ke thik paanch baras pehle relies hue is geet ne kai jan-samudaay ko apni giraft main le liya tha
 This song from the film 'kismet' has delivered a sharp message of the call of independence
 gane ke bol ke saath hi amirbai karnatakai kii awaz gane ko sabase alag bana diya he
 This historical song composed for the film 'shaheed' was composed by Master Ghulam Haider
 mo
 In the voice of Rafi and companions, this song had also won the popularity of that era and proved to be the most important aspect of the success of the film in its own way
 is geet kii dhun, uski samvedansheel gayikee or puure geet main kores ke samavet swar ke saath mo
 The sentiments of Rafi and Khan Mastan are staggering
 is geet ke madhyam se mahatma gandhi ke prayaason ko behtareen dhang se samajhaayaa gaya he
 In this song the poet Pt
 pradeep ne apni bhavanaaen udel di hai, jisase yah geet athulaneey ban gaya he
 The song was filmed when the entire India was grieved by the tragedy and discouragement caused by the india-china war
 is geet ko bharatiyon main apni sena ke prati aadar or prem jagaane ke rup main bhi dekha jaataa he
 Mo
 rafee kii dardebhari aawaaj ke jariye yah geet asaadhaaran oonchaaiyaan hasil karata he
 The symbolic message of this song that is still on people's tongues is that the three great people who composed it - Madan Mohan, Kaifi Azmi and Moe
 rafee, kahin apni shuddh rachanaatmakataa main hindu-muslim ekta kii adbhut ibaarat rach rahe the
 This song is part of the historical film 'shaheed', which is completely obsessed with the message of nationality
 bhagat singh, sukhdev or raajaguru ke krantikari balidaan ko aadhaar banaakar rache gayi is behad bhavuk or hriday vidaarak geet main mukesh, mahendra or rajendra mehta ne parshvagayan kiya tha
 Even today, listening to this song makes you cry and soaks in the unique spirit of patriotism from within
 yah kaha ja saktaa he ki yah geet rashtrabhakti ke geeton main ek mahaan geet kaa darza rakhata he
 The song is a song of India's glorious past, cultural affluence and call for Indianness, which was composed by lyricist Rajendra Krishna in a very meaningful sense
 mo
 The cinematic expression of Prithviraj Kapoor on this song, performed in the evergreen voice of Rafi, also looks fantastic
 hameshaa se sadabahaar rahaa yah geet, aaj bhi har ek ke samaran main bilkul naye jaisaa he

 kuch samay pehle china ke ek bank FINES ne ek rota nikaala tha
 This rota was not a common rota
 ye rota bank main kaam karne vaali mahilaon ke liye tha
 In which she was told when she could be pregnant
 unke pregnent hone kaa maheenaa bank ne tay kiya tha
 The bank had also issued a notice that if a female employee becomes pregnant before their stipulated date, then she will have to pay damages
 jab ye khabar padhi thi to yahi sochaa tha ki ye sab china main hi hota hoga
 No one can do this in India but this thinking was wrong
 china ke is maamle se miltaa-julata ek maamla noida kaa bhi he
 Where a multinational company refused to give maternity leave to its only HR employee
 itnaa hi nahin un par dabaav banaaya ki yaa to wo khud rizin kar den varanaa unhen terminete kar diya jayega
 While pregnancy requires co-operation, care and a good environment, torturing a single mother in this way is really nothing short of a crime
 ye puraa maamla noida main rahane vaali radhika gupta kaa he
 Radhika, 28, joined Radius Synergy International Private Limited in 2014 as an assistant manager
 2016 main unhone family plan kii lekin offis kii jimmedaariyon se kinaaraa nahin kiya
 Despite being pregnant for 7 months, she went to office till June 2016
 lekin jab unhone apni company se matternity live kii baat kahi to company ke rukh ne unhen pareshaani main daal diya
 The company did not agree to the matter of maternity leave, but definitely started torturing them mentally
 torchar itnaa zyada tha ki unki tabiyat bighad gai
 He had to be taken to the hospital where the doctor advised him to rest
 radhika ko matternity live 1 sitambar se chahie thi
 But due to ill health, he had to take medical leave
 haalanki unhone company ko ye aashwaasan bhi de rakhaa tha ki wo us dauraan bhi ghar se hi offis kaa kaam dekhati rahengi
 Instead of appreciating his responsible behavior, his company started harassing him
 radhika company ke echaar department kaa sara kaam akele sambhalati thim
 This was the reason he promised to help from home
 lekin company ne unhen saaf taur par kah diya ki wo unhen matternity live nahin de sakate
 Neither did the company give them medical leave and it was not right to talk about maternity leave
 ek din company ke aalaa adhikariyon ke saath meeting hui or unhen do took shabdon main bol diya gaya ki yaa to wo khud rizin kar den varanaa unhen terminete kar diya jayega
 When Radhika refused to design, she was given a termination letter
 is letters ne radhika ko andar tak tod diya
 The time in which they should be more and more happy, they started seeing their future in darkness
 do saal tak ek company ke liye raat-din mehnat karne ke baad koi bhi aisa hi mahasoos karata
 Whereas under our law, during pregnancy no female employee can be fired
 par radhika ne khud ko sameta or ek nai ladaai ke liye uth khadi huin
 He gave his voice to every place where he could get help
 mahila evam bal vikaas mantralay main bhi unhone khat likhaa, jis par menka gandhi kii ore se unhen uchit kadam uthaae jane kaa aashwaasan mila he
 There are many laws in our country for the interests of women
 sarkari karmchaariyon ke liye to pehle se hi 26 saptaah yaa chah maheene kii matternity live di jaati he
 Private companies offer a maximum leave of three months
 lekinmatternity benifit act1961 main badlaav karke privet companiyon ko ek nae vidheyak ke tahat apni mahila karmchaariyon ko 6 maheene kii matternity live deni hi hogi
 The bill is planned to be introduced in the coming session
 aise main radhika kii ladaai maanviya hone ke saath hi kanoonee bhi he
 At the same time, this story of hers is also a lesson for all the women who are scared of situations and calm down

 Patna All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has approved the opening of 6 Government Colleges and 10 Polytechnic Institutes in Bihar
 is par aaj rajya sarkaar ne bataaya ki in takneekee shikshan sansthaanon main 2016-17 satr se hi padhai shuru kar di jaaegi
 Addressing reporters here today, Bihar Science and Technology Minister Jai Kumar Singh said that AICTE has given permission to open 6 engineering colleges and 10 polytechnic institutes in the state and started studying in these institutes from 2016-17 session itself
 Will go
 unhone kaha ki pradesh main takneekee shikshan santhaan ke vikaas main aaj kaa din mile kaa pathar siddh hone jaisaa he chunki keval varsh 2016 main sarkari kshetra main rajya sarkaar dwaara kul 16 takneekee sansthaanon kii sthapana kii gai he
 Singh said that 7 Engineering Colleges and 22 Polytechnic Institutes in Bihar are already functioning, whose enrollment capacities are 1643 and 6015 respectively
 unhone bataaya ki is varsh bihar sanyukt pravesh pratiyogita pariksha parishad ke madhyam se rajya ke sarkari abhiyantran evampolitechnic sansthanonmen pratiyogita pariksha ke madhyam se pravesh liya jaataa he
 38400 thousand students have applied for admission against admission capacity 1643 in Government Engineering Colleges
 isi tarah rajya ke sarkari palitechnic sansthaanon main pravesh kshamta 6015 ke viruddh pravesh ke liye aavedakon kii kul sankhya 115000 he
 Singh said that now with the opening of new 6 engineering colleges and 10 polytechnic institutes, 13 engineering colleges and 32 polytechnic institutes have been added in the state, whose enrollment capacity has increased to 3002 and 8014 respectively
 jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main suraksha balon ke kafile par hua aatanki hamalaa 18 sitambar 2016 ko uri sector main sena mukhyalay par hue hamale se bhi bada hamalaa bataaya ja rahaa he
 44 soldiers were killed and 45 were injured in this attack
 is hamale kii jimmedaari pakistan sthit aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne lee he
 To avenge the attack on the army camp at Uri, the Indian Army entered the Pakistani border and carried out a surgical strike
 baavjood iske seemaa paar se pryojit aatanki ghatnaon par lagaam nahin lagi
 The Army's Operation All Out campaign continues in the Kashmir Valley
 jiske tahat pichley teen saal main suraksha balon ne pichley teen saal main 586 aatanki maar giraae hai
 This information was given by the Union Home Ministry in the Rajya Sabha recently
 iske alaava pakistan kii taraf se niyantran rekha par sangharsh viraam kaa ulanghan bhi hota rahaa, lekin sena ke javaanon ne unka munh tod jawaab diya
 Pakistan, which has been constantly mouthing the border, once again started carrying out the conspiracies
 jiske tahat seemaa paar se ghuspaith kii koshishen to tej hui hi saath hi ghati main yuvaaon ko bhi is sajeesh kaa hissaa banaaya jane laga
 Explain that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Center withdrew support from the People's Democratic Party (PDP), terming Kashmir's security a threat
 tab se ghati main sidhe centre kaa niyantran he
 Due to this, the forces are continuously campaigning against the terrorists
 haalanki surakshabalon ko isamen kamyaabi bhi mili he
 But despite all this, such a big terrorist incident means that the nefarious spirits of the terrorists have not diminished
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki kashmir ke pulavama main jis sadak par yah hamalaa hua vah pichley kai dinon se barfbaari ke kaaran band thi or kal hi ise kholaa gaya tha
 To carry out this attack, the terrorists launched a suicide attack on a vehicle in the convoy of security forces
 is kafile main 50 se zyada vaahan shaamil the jisamen 2500 jawan savaar the
 Despite such a large movement of security forces and the alerts of agencies, this attack can be called a big security lapse
 sargical strike ke baad yah mana ja rahaa tha ki pakistan isse sikh lete hue apane napak mansoobon par lagaam lagayegaa
 After the change of Nizam, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan also talked about aman-o-aman
 lekin imran bhi pakistan kii dharti par aatankwaad kii upaj rokane main naakaam rahe
 This can be gauged from the fact that Maulana Masood Azhar's younger brother and jaish-e-mohammed's leader Maulana Rauf Asghar rallies in Karachi on February 5, exactly 10 days ago
 Announces saal kii shuruyaat main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne eenai ko die apane intervyuu main kaha tha ham pakistan se 1965, 1971, kargil yuddh lard chuke hai
 It would be a big mistake to think that Pakistan would improve with a fight (surgical strike)
 pakistan ko sudharne main abhi or samay lagegaa
 However, Pakistan has once again been exposed to this major terrorist attack in Pulwama, while there has also been a big question about security in the country
 big bos 13 ke duusare 'weekend kaa waar' episod main is sijan kaa pehla nomination hua
 In the first nomination, Daljeet Kaur is homeless
 lekin logon ko dalajit kaa ghar se beghar hona bilkul pasand nahin aayaa he
 Social media users are strongly opposing the removal of Daljit from Bigg Boss house
 darasal, big bos ke ghar main dalajit kaa safar kaaphi acha rahaa he
 In the 2-week journey, Daljit was neither seen betraying anyone nor fighting forcefully with anyone
 dalajit ne kaaphi gres ke saath big bos main apana game khelaa he
 Salman Khan himself also praised his journey on the show, while activating Daljeet from home
 dalajitne big bos ke ghar main jis tarah apni persenality ko saamne rakhaa he, use phans ne kaaphi pasand kiya he
 This is the reason that the fans are very disappointed and are expressing their displeasure on social media for the first time from the show to being homeless from Daljit's house
 phans kaa maananaa he kibig boske ghar se dalajit kaa nikalnaa behad anfere he
 Some believe that Shahnaz Kaur should have been homeless from home instead of Daljeet
 vahiin, kuch logon kaa kahana he ki daljati kii jagah koyna ko bhi ghar se nikaala ja saktaa tha

 Komi was unceremoniously removed from the post a day earlier
 komi ne kaha ki vah unhen pad se hataae jane ke faisle yaa ‘is faisle par amal kiye jane ke tareeke’par baat nahin karnaa chaahate
 In her farewell letter written in an email, Komi said, 'it's done

 Although i will miss you and this mission very much
 ’is email ke bare main sabase pehali khabar sienen ne di
 At the same time, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan defended the President's decision to remove Komi, saying that many Republicans, Democrats and senior officials of the Ministry of Justice had lost confidence in him
 epabiai ke is pad ke10saal ke kaarykaal main komi tisare saal apni sevaayen de rahe the
 Suddenly, Trump removed him from the post
 white house ne kal kaha ki vah trump kaa vishwaas kho chuke the or raashtrapati pehle hi din se komi ko hataane ke bare main soch rahe the
 Reiterating the White House talk, Ryan said that it was a poor idea to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the relationship between Trump's campaign and Russia in the presidential election
 komi ne likhaa, ‘main lambey samay se maanata aayaa hum ki ek raashtrapati epabiai ke nideshak ko kisi bhi vajah se yaa bevajaah bhi,pad se hataa sakate he

 chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh chauthi baar satta main aane ke liye tantra-mantra or totake kaa sahaara lene ke maamle main surkhiyon main hai
 It is being told that they have fallen into the formula 19-04 after the advice of one seeker, although Raman Singh himself has rejected such talk and opposition allegations
 unhone saaf kiya ki unhen tantra mantra main koi bharosa nahin he
 Raman Singh took a dig at the Congress and said that the next time i take the car, i will ask the Congress to decide the number of vehicles
 unke liye har number lucky he
 According to him, the transport department decides the number of vehicles
 darasal rajnatik galiyaaron main 19-04 ke formule ko lekar bahes chhidi hui he
 The opposition has associated this formula with those who stay close to the Chief Minister and are well-known in matters of tantra mantra and pooja recitation
 khabaron ke mutabik mukhyamantri sachivayal ne 19 pagero gaadiyaan kharidi hai or in sabhi gadiyon kaa number 0004 he jiskaa taatpary chauthi baar satta main kabiz hona or 19 gadiyon kaa matlab bataur mukhyamantri 19 saal puure karnaa he
 Assembly elections are due in 2018 in Chhattisgarh, so Chief Minister Raman Singh's new convoy of cars remains a matter of discussion
 isamen shaamil sabhi pagero gaadiyaan ek hi rang or ek hi number kii hai
 The number of all trains is 0004 in terms of safety
 itnaa hi nahin, kaha yah bhi ja rahaa he ki in gadiyon kaa rang kaala isliye he taaki kisi bhi tarah kii najar se ise bachaaya ja sake
 It is being told that the Chief Minister Secretariat has 19 such gleaming vehicles
 ye sabhi gaadiyaan hafte bhar pehle hi kharidi gai hai
 After the puja ritual, Chief Minister Raman Singh and his associates along with the entire Lashkar have boarded this new vehicle
 din kii bela main ek khaas muhurt main gadiyon kaa kafila mukhyamantri nivas se baahar kii ore niklaa
 Whoever saw this convoy of Chief Minister Raman Singh for the first time kept looking
 mukhyamantri raman singh ke puraane kafile main tata safari gaadiyaan thim
 Chief Minister Raman Singh has recently abandoned the old convoy
 ek jaankaree ke mutabik is kafile main shaamil zyaadaatar gaadiyaan 10 saal se bhi zyada puraani ho gai thi
 Chief Minister Raman Singh has flown the BJP in Chhattisgarh for the third consecutive time, riding in all the same safari vehicles
 saal 2003, 2008 or 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main apane isi kafile par savaar hokar unhone congress ko lagaataar teen baar parrast kiya he
 According to the officers of the Chief Minister's Secretariat, Pajero vehicles are more effective in terms of security
 mukhyamantri kheme kaa bhale hi jo bhi kahana ho lekin nai gadiyon ke khaas number or unki sankhya bal ko lekar rajnatik galiyara garmaaya hua he
 Astrologers are also making many claims regarding this
 19-04 ke formule par kya kehete hai jyotishjyothish shastri govindgiri goswami ke mutabik ank jyotish par 13, 04, 22 or 31 ye jo ank he uskaa swami rahu he
 As in 04, it is seen smartly in your vehicle
 kundali main ye jo 19 he wo 19 gadiyon kii sankhya he
 See, 9 and the radix of one is one, whose lord is Surya
 surya jiskaa karak grah hota he, jiskaa swami hota he, aise aadmi kii vijay pataakaa kahin rukati nahin he
 He would have been a factor of the soul
 vijay hote sarvatra raja chakravati samraat ke yoga banege
 Raman Singh's convoy of old trains first had a dozen vehicles
 in sabhi gadiyon kaa number 107 tha
 According to astrologers, the radius of 107 is 08
 yah shani kaa ank hota he isliye mukhyamantri raman singh lagaataar 14 saalon tak satta main bane hue hai
 Astrologers believe that Rahu's downward trend in the Chief Minister Raman Singhki horoscope has been going on since 2015, but it will yield better results in the early months of 2018
 mukhyamantri raman singh bijepi ke pehle aise mukhyamantri hai jo record tod dinon tak lagaataar mukhyamantri kii kursi par kabiz rahe
 As Chief Minister, he is scheduled to complete 14 years on 12 December
 itane adhik dinon tak bijepi main koi bhi lagaataar mukhyamantri nahin rahaa
 It is being told that Chief Minister Raman Singh has set himself up for the fourth time in the 2018 assembly elections
 sam, daam, dand, bhed main paarangat raman singh ke is daanv ko dekhakar congress tilamila uthi he
 He is seen walking on his aspirations with the 19-04 formula
 congress mahasachiv ramesh varlyani ke mutabik ek tantric ke kehane par nai gaadiyaan kharidi gai hai
 According to him, the tantrik has said that keeping the number four will also win the fourth innings
 unhone kataaksh karte hue kaha ki chauthi pari kaam se milegi naa ki number game se
 For this only the sum of 19 -04 is being proved

 ab ek game khatm ho gaya he or doosraa shuru
 Yes, with the end of the Commonwealth Games, people have started the second game
 sabhi log safalataa kaa shrey lene main jute gaye hai or virdohi ek-duusare kii taang-khinchaai main
 a kind of political rot has dissolved in the air anyway
 isi safalataa ke bich kisi ne yah shigupha bhi ched diya he ki kaamanwealth khelon ke safal aayojan ke baad ab kyon naa bharat olympic khelon kaa aayojan kare
 The bigger the event, the more Bandarbant
 qamar wahid naqvi ko likhen
 There is no doubt that these games were highly successful and the credit goes to all the sportspersons and athletes who gave India 101 medals on their own and won the victory flag of India all over the world
 ye ham sab jaanate hai ki hamaare desh main khel sanghathan kis tarah kaam karte hai or desh main khelon ke utthan main unka kya yogadan he
 Our players, who were known to very few people, they achieved great success in these sports with their hard work and dedication
 in khelon ne desh ke chote shaharon or kasbon main rahane vaale un naujavaanon main ab ye vishwaas paidaa kiya he ki wo bhi oonche khwab dekh sakate hai
 This is the real success of these games in the true sense
 iskaa sara shrey un khilaadiyon ko jaataa he, jinhen cricket ke peeche bhaagane vaale media ne kabhi tavajjo nahin di
 Hats off to such players
 hamen unpar garv he
 Now the question arises, will anything change after this? Can our players now hope that they will get an environment in which they can improve their game and make themselves truly world class? Will it become a national agenda? One of the biggest questions is that the news of corruption and negligence related to these games, which had been coming for the last few months, got buried in the noise of the Games
 kya unki jaanch hogi or doshiyon ko sajaa milegi? yaa phir khelon kii safalataa ke baad un sabko bhula diya jayega? agar aisa hota he, to yah khelon kii sarvaadhik tragedeepurn parinti hogi

 Being a union person, my simplicity became part of my nature

 Sources close to Advani did not pay any attention to the issue
 unhone kaha ki koi bhram nahin he
 Also expressed confidence that Advani will soon be allotted room

 dilli main dopahiyaa vaahanon par peeche baithne vaali mahilaon ke liye bhi helmet pahananaa anivaary hoga
 However Sikh women are exempted from this and wearing helmets will be optional for them
 dilli sarkaar ne aaj tatkaal prabhaav se ise anivaary karte hue adhisuchana jari kar di
 The Government has amended Rule 115 of the Delhi Motor Vehicles Rules, 1993 for new provisions
 parivahan vibhaag ke ek sheersh adhikari ne kaha, dilli main dopahiyaa vaahanon par baithne vaali mahila savaariyon ke liye helmet pahananaa ab anivaary hoga
 However, Sikh women are excluded from its purview on religious grounds
 uparajyapal najeeb jang ne bhi sikh mahilaon ko chhodkar sabhi mahila savaariyon ke liye helmet pahananaa anivaary karne ke prastaav ko manjuuri di thi
 According to the Transport Department, in Delhi alone, in 2012, a total of 576 passengers boarding two-wheelers lost their lives in accidents
 dopahiyaa motor vaahanon main sabase bada khatra helmet kaa istemaal nahin karne se mana jaataa he
 This rule was also made by the Delhi government in 1998, but it was made optional after opposition from the people of the Sikh community
 pehle sena ke ritred general or ab sena ke hi leftinent general, ye donon hi adhikari ek hi sur main daawa kar rahe hai ki 'adarsh imaarat se koi khatra nahin he
 ' adarsh kamishan ke saamne pesh hue sena ke purv leftinent general tejinder singh ne ek baar phir raksha mantralay ke daavon par sawalia nishaan laga diya he
 While the Ministry of Defense is claiming that the Adarsh building is a major threat to the army base of Colaba, the two officers appearing before the commission have said that there is no question of danger
 leftinent general singh ne kamishan ko bataaya ki adarsh imaarat ke bare main afvaah chal rahi thi ki kolaba ilaake main ban rahi civillian imaarat main sena ke logon ko bhi flats mil rahaa he
 i came to know about this rumor during my Delhi posting
 mumbai main posting saal 2005 main hui lekin imaarat main flats ke liye saal 2006 main aavedan kiya
 All the things about the building and the place were known before the application was made
 leftinent general singh ne daawa kiya ki puure kolaba stesan main sirf sena kii rihaishi imaaraten hai na ki sena kaa koi hathiyaaron kaa bhandar
 In such a situation, how can there be danger from ideal building? Singh said, Adarsh building can be seen only for the depot of the wing that supplies the army, is this logistics wing a sensitive location? singh ne kamishan ko yah bhi bataaya ki unke jiosi rahane tak unhone vishleshan kiya or uske anusaar adarsh kisi bhi tarah se sena ke liye khatra nahin he
 Singh claims that there is no threat to the base from any high-rice building around the base
 tippaniyan Talking to the media, Singh said that now it should be investigated who has thrown the whole case wrongly
 iske pehle kamishan ke saamne pesh hue purv sena pramukh deepak kapur ne bhi adarsh se kisi bhi prakaar kaa khatra hone se inkaar kiya tha
 After this statement of Deepak Kapoor, the country's Defense Minister Antony had to be clarified
 gauratlab he ki kapur or singh kaa imaarat main flats he or aise main unka imaarat ko sena ke base ke liye khatra na bataanaa laazmi he
 Former Army Lieutenant General Tejinder Singh, who appeared before the Adarsh commission, has once again questioned the claims of the Ministry of Defense
 jahaan raksha mantralay daawa kar rahaa he ki adarsh imaarat kolaba ke sena base ke liye ek bada khatra he vahiin kamishan ke saamne pesh hue in donon adhikariyon ne kaha he ki khatre kii koi baat nahin he
 Lieutenant General Singh told the commission that there was a rumor about the Adarsh building that army people are also getting flats in the Civilian building being built in Colaba area
 is afvaah ke bare main mujhe meri dilli posting ke dauraan pataa chalaa
 The posting in Mumbai took place in the year 2005 but applied in 2006 for a flat in the building
 aavedan dene se pehle imaarat or jagah ke bare main sari baaten pataa kar lee thim
 Lieutenant General Singh claimed that the entire Colaba station has only residential military buildings and not an army stock of arms
 aise main adarsh imaarat se kaise khatra ho saktaa he? singh ne bataaya, adarsh imaarat se sirf sena ko rasad pahunchane vaale wing ke depo ko dekha ja saktaa he, kya ye rasad wing koi samvedansheel lokation he? Singh also told the commission that he did the analysis until he was the GOC and according to him, Adarsh was not a threat to the army in any way
 singh kaa daawa he kii adarsh hi kya base ke aasapaas ke kisi bhi hai rice imaarat se base ko koi khatra nahin he
 The comments media se baat karte hue singh ne kaha ki ab to is baat kii jaanch kerani chahie ki is puure maamle ko kisne galat tareeke se uchhaala he
 Former army chief Deepak Kapoor, who appeared before the commission before this, also denied any threat from Adarsh
 deepak kapur ke is bayaan ke baad desh ke rakshaamantri antni ko safai deni padi thi
 It is worth noting that Kapoor and Singh have a flat in the building and in such a situation, it is impossible to tell their building a threat to the army base

 The demonetization data released by the Reserve Bank of India has put the Indian government on the backfoot
 RBI ke dwaara jari aankadon ke anusaar jis makasad se notebandi kii gai thi, us bade lakshya se vah kaaphi dur rahi
 After the data comes, there is a verbal war between the opposition and the government
 vittamantri arun jetali ne sarkaar kii ore se safai pesh kar rahe hai
 Jaitley made several demonetization arguments during this period
 kya bole the modi ?8 november, 2016 ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jab desh ko kiye apane sambodhan main notebandi kaa elaan kiya tha, us dauraan kya tark die the
 Let's look at these
 
 
 notebandi ke elaan ke dauraan piem modi ne notebandi ke kaaphi tark die the
 The PM had said that the number of cash in India's economic system is very high, we will have to move towards cashless economy soon
 piem ne kaha tha ki adhik cash hone ke kaaran system main bhrashtachar ke chance bad jate hai
 This promotes hawkers, which also leads to increase in black money
 modi ne kaha tha ki in sabhi gatividhiyon par rokthaam ke liye 8 nanvabar, 2016 kii madhya raatri se hi 500 or 1000 ke note band karne kaa nirnay kar rahe hai
 This step will intensify the fight against corruption, black money and fake notes
 main sabhi deshavaasiyon se is mahayajna main madad karne kii apil karata hum
 Has demonetization proved to be a flop? After the RBI figures, the opposition attacker, Jaitley gave a clarification
 Now what did Arun Jaitley say? After the figures came out, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had to immediately come in front of the media
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki notebandi ke fail ho jane kii baat karne vaale or uski aalochana karne vaale kanfus hai
 Such people do not understand the whole purpose of demonetisation
 iskar vibhaag jaanch kar rahaa hajetali kaa kahana tha notebandi ke baad uske sambandh main kuch log tippanee kar rahe hai ki notebandi kaa ek maatr uddeshy ye tha ki log paisa jamaa naa karaaen or paisa jabt ho jayega
 Those who have never fought a war against black money in life, may not understand the purpose of this whole process
 ye kisi kaa paisa jabt karne kaa uddeshy nahin tha
 If money comes in the banking system, it does not mean that all that money is legitimate
 is paise ke khilaaf iskar vibhaag puri jaanch karata he
 This is the reason millions of people have been put on notice
 jiskaa ek pratyaksh asar hua he ki diarect tex base badha he
 It has also increased the impact of GST
 notebandi ke aankadon par sarkaar vs vipaksh: samajhen koun paas or koun fail?'har jamaa rakam vaid nahin hoti'arun jetali ne bataaya ki notebandi kaa uddeshy tha ki tex base bade
 It was also intended that action should be taken against the people who deposited black money
 saath hi vyavastha se jaali note alag kar paaen
 Also, the aim was to create a lace cash system
 algaavvaadiyon par hua kadaa warsawtha hi notebandi se algaavvaadiyon ko bhi aarthik chot pahunchi he
 The terrorists have seized the money
 aise main paisa vyavastha main aa jaae to wo vaid paisa nahin ho jaataa he
 Arun Jaitley said that all the objectives of the government are on track
 RBI kii report par jetali kii safai- paise jamaa karnaa nahin tha notebandi kaa makasadatex kaa dayera badhanaa tha lakshyaisi par vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki notebandi kaa uddeshy paisa jamaa karnaa nahin tha
 Fake notes were detected by demonetisation
 iskaa lakshya tex kaa dayera badhanaa tha
 Demonetisation affected terrorism and Naxalism
 chunaav main kaledhan par roak aglaa lakshyajetali ne bataaya ki notebandi kaa uddeshy cash len-dein kam karnaa tha
 The exchange of cash is reduced by 17 percent
 notebandi kaa prabhaav sahi raste par he or bhavishya main centre jo bha kadam uthayega, uskaa aadhaar us par aadhaarit hoga
 The Finance Minister said that the next step of the government is to ban black money in elections
 jetali ne kaha ki jin logon ko kaale dhan se nipatane kii kam samaj he vahi bainkon main ai nakadi ko notebandi se jod rahe hai
 The purpose of demonetisation was to reduce the dependence on cash in the economy, to digitize, increase the tax net and deal with black money
 notebandi ke baad nakadi kii kami ke kaaran chhattisgarh or jammu kashmir main aatankwaadi or algaavvaadi gatividhiyon main giravat ai he
 The RBI report says that in the report released for the financial year 2016-17, 3285 million notes of ₹ 2000 are currently in circulation
 2000 rupye kii kul vailu 6571 billian rupye he
 At present, 5882 million notes of 500 are in circulation in the country, worth 2941 billion
 98
 According to the statement given by the Minister of State for Finance Santosh Gangwar in the Lok Sabha on 3 February, 6 per cent of the note returned to the RBI

 It has been argued that this is a pending case of the previous government, but the way the government has decided to increase the import duty of sugar has raised many questions
 khaskar yah ki kya chini kii mithaas ab kadavaahat main badal jaaegi?desh main chini par aayaat shulk badha diya gaya he
 It is clear that the government wants to help the sugar industry of the country that is struggling and to prevent the loss due to cheap foreign sugar imports
 darasal, ab tak chini par aayaat shulk mahaj 15 fisadi tha, jise badhaakar 40 fisadi kar diya gaya he
 Similarly, the period of export subsidy of Rs 3300 per tonne to exporters on sugar exports has also been extended till the month of September 2014
 kya he sarkaar kaa iradasarkaar chaahati he ki desh ke chini udyog ko badhaava mili or unke jamaa stock desh ke hi bazaar main beche jaaen

 However, what will be the effect of this decision of the government and how widespread it will be, but it is certain that the common man who is suffering the blows of inflation is no longer willing to bear the bitterness of sugar

 Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has said that the current rise in onion and tomato prices in the country is seasonal
 paswan ne bataaya ki vibhinn utpaadak rajyon se pyaaj or tamaato kii nai fasal jald hi bazaar main aana shuru hogi jiske baad saptaah bhar main sthiti saamaanya ho jaaegi
 However, this statement of the Union Minister is slightly less than the truth
 pyaaj or tamaato kii keemton main ijapha isliye nahin ho rahaa he ki yah ijaphe kaa sijan he
 The increase is because the central government has exported the rabi yields in cold storage in the past months
 yah export krishi visheshgyon ke us anumaan ke baad hua jisamen chetaya gaya tha ki gaya monsoon (dakshin-pashchim) pyaaj-tomator kii kharif paidaavaar ke liye thik nahin he or nai fasal kii paidaavaar main giravat darj hone kii sambhaavna he
 The new yields will improve in a week? The soon-to-be-ready kharif varieties of onions have started coming to the mandis of Delhi and this crop is being extracted in various onion producing states which will start coming soon in the market
 pyaaj kii der se taiyaar hone vaali kismon kii upaj janvari se bazaar main aane lagegi or abhi saptaah bhar main sthiti saamaanya hone kii disha main badhane lagengi
 Also read: Foreign Gaya Stocks kept in cold storage, wait for cheap onion Kharif crop, Union Minister said that increase in price of tomatoes and onions is seasonal
 pyaaj kii nai fasal kii aavak main sudhaar hone ke saath ekaadh saptaah main keemten kam hona shuru ho jaayengi
 He said that varieties ready to be produced in the market from October onwards have started arriving in the mandis
 51rupee kilo pyaaj or 80 rupee kilo tamaataravyapaar ke aankadon ke mutabik rashtriya rajdhani main pyaaj kii khudara keemat 51 rupee kilo chal rahi he jabaki tamaato kii keemat 80 rupee kilo he
 Onion is being sold at Mother Dairy's sales center for Rs 47 per kg and tomato is priced at Rs 70 per kg
 kharif sijan main 25 fisadi kam rahaa pyaaj tamaato kii buaai kaa rakaboupabhokta maamalon ke sachiv avinaash shrivastav ne kaha ki pyaaj kii jald taiyaar hone vaali kism kii paj mandiyon main aane lagi hai tathaa rajasthan, gujarat, maharashtra, madhya pradesh or andhra pradesh jaise utpaadak rajyon main taaja fasal ko nikaala ja rahaa he
 He said that onion prices are under pressure due to 25% reduction in area under cultivation of onion varieties
 lekin pyaaj kii kharif fasal or der se taiyaar hone vaali kharif fasal kaa rakabaa kahin behatar he or utpaadan bhi behatar hone kii sambhaavna he
 Also read: India missed out to become number-1 now, 200 years later, the number was 125% higher in August, it is worth mentioning that earlier in the month of August also, the central government claimed that price stability after the new crop comes in a month
 Will come
 lekin aisa nahin hua
 In fact, according to the export data for the first quarter of the financial year 2017-18, onion-tomato crop kept in cold storage of the country was sent abroad
 is timahi ke export aankadon ke mutabik vitt varsh 2017-18 ke pehle maheene yani april main hi desh se pyaaj export main kareeb 125 fisadi kii badhotaree hui thi
 a total of 3,20,943 tonnes of onions have been exported from the country during April, while last year only 1,42,767 tonnes of onions were exported from the country
 niryaat kaa yah silsilaa lagaataar puri timahi ke dauraan jari rahaa
 The cold storage, which was empty despite the monsoon warning, along with this truth, agricultural experts had already issued a warning on the southwest monsoon move that onion-tomato kharif yields are expected to be low in the current season
 iske chalate in fasalon ke liye ahm kai ilaakon main buaai kaa rakabaa kam kar diya gaya tha
 After which it was estimated that onion and tomato yields in kharif crops will be less than normal
 gauratlab he ki is chetavanee ke baad yah jaruri tha ki desh ko coldstorage main rakhi fasal ko export karne se zyada tarjeeh sambhaal kar rakhane par di jaati jisase maujuuda samay main badhati keemton ko lagaam lagane ke liye stock kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa

 Roy was not the only one to know Pegasus, the white-winged horse described in the Greek myths in his country, but suddenly the name is on everyone's tongue because the smart spyware of this name is spying on people
 angreji akhbaar indian express main 1 november ko khabar chhapi ki israeli spiware pegasus ke jariye kam se kam do darjan bhartiya patrakaron, activiston or anya logon ke phone kii jasusi kii gai
 whatsapp and its parent company Facebook in a federal court in California sued spyware maker Israeli company NSO Group Technology for hacking 1,400 smartphones through a whatsapp server
 isaki jaankaree may, 2019 main ek baari sibar hamale ke strot kii pahchaan or use block karne ke kram main mili, jiske jariye duniyabar ke 100 se adhik maanavadhikaar kaaryakartaaon, patrakaron or anya logon ko lakshya kiya gaya tha
 So is the end to end encryption of whatsapp not secure? Yes, other people cannot read your phone message
 lekin us massej ko padhgaye ke liye, aapke handset par use dicript kiya jaataa he
 The spyware in your phone can intercept your display or keyboard, camera, or mic, and listen to your conversation on the phone, or in your room
 amuman spiware tabhi sakriy hota he jab uske massej main ek link par clic karen
 But Pegasus took advantage of a weakness in whatsapp (which was resolved in May) in which spyware is installed on the handset with just one video call
 aapako us kol kaa jawaab dene kii bhi jarurat nahin hoti—bas missd kol bhar se hi aapke phone main spiware downlod or phir install ho jaataa he
 Then, through the weaknesses of Android or IOS software, the mic or camera begins to operate
 pegasus tab aapke phone main aapke massej padhuya, camera yaa microphone chaalu karnaa, phone main filon ko jodpha or hataanaa or phone ke data main herpher karnaa jaisi chizon ke saath vah sab kar saktaa tha jo aap karte hai
 In the first few days of November, journalists tracked down more than two dozen names who were contacted by whatsapp stating that their phones had been hacked
 inamen activist, patrkaar, vakil or vipaksh ke ek netaa bhi the
 All these were either outspoken people against the government or lawyers representing those critics of the government
 enesao group kaa kahana he ki pegasus keval sarkari agenciyon ko bechaa jaataa he or patrakaron tathaa activist ke khilaaf istemaal ke liye nahin he
 This 'legal espionage' tool is available to governments, including regimes with dubious human rights records
 saudi arab sarkaar ne apane virdohi khaashakaji kii jasusi (or baad main maarane) ke liye is spiware kaa istemaal kiya tha
 In 2016, the NSO allegedly took $ 6,50,000 to hack every 10 devices, in addition to a $ 5,00,000 fee for installing spyware
 to is dharti par koun-si sarkaar bhartiya aalochakon, asantushton, patrakaron ko nishaanaa banane ke liye itnaa paisa kharch karegi? yah pataa karne ke liye kisi sharlak homes ko nahin lagaana padegaa ki bharat kii sarkaar hi sambhavit ho sakati he
 Our government has denied this and it rained on whatsapp why it did not tell earlier
 lekin use soochna di gai thi
 It was also on the website of the cyber security government agency cert-in
 haalanki 17 may ke us note ko website se turant hataa liya gaya tha or sarkari sutron ne media ko bataaya ki whatsap kaa vah note itnaa technical tha ki siiarti-in kii samaj se hi baahar tha
 To this, whatsapp says that it had informed the government by writing a letter for the second time in general English in September, stating that 121 Indians were targeted through Pegasus
 sarkari adhikariyon ne media ko bataaya ki yah sab, or america mukademe kaa samay sandigdh he
 This is happening at a time when the Indian government is going to change the law related to intermediaries to detect messages on social media
 sarkaar whatsap sandeshon kii nigaraanee kyon karnaa chaahati he? kyonki forward kii gai farji khabaron ke kaaran logon ne jaan ganvaai hai
 In 2017, the rumors of seven people killed in Jharkhand started, more than 50 attacks were recorded in two years
 aapkaa data aapkaa naheembharat kaa ity kanoon or uske niyamon ke mutabik ek 'intermediri yaa madhyasth' kisi bhi third-party soochna yaa saamagree ke liye tab tak uttaradaayi nahin he, jab tak yah vaid tareeke se kaary karata he
 The government will now amend those rules next January, as it says intermediaries need to make more provisions to prevent the spread of misinformation
 sarkaar chaahati he ki whatsap or anya plateform sandeshon kii nigaraanee karen or maange jane par forworded maisaj ke mul preshak kaa pataa lagaaein, or vivaadit saamagree ko nasht karen
 But whatsapp is encrypted
 koi third party, yahaan tak ki khud whatsap bhi, un sandeshon ko na to pard saktaa he yaa na kol ko intercept (handset par spiware ke bina) kar saktaa he
 That is why many other people, including people from the government and ruling parties, also use whatsapp for phone calls
 sarkaar kii baat maanane ke liye, whatsap ko ancripshan ko khatm karnaa hoga
 This led to 40 crores in India and around 1 worldwide
 5 arab whatsap istemaal karne vaale logon ke liye gopneeyata sangrakshan kanoonon ke abhaav main agenciyon kii sambhavit nigaraanee or utpeeda kaa rasta khul jayega
 Yes, China does that
 vah vichet ke sandeshon kii nigaraanee or niyantran karata he, or virdohi gaayab ho jate hai
 But India is not China, although the government here is influenced by its neighbor
 maamla sirf whatsap kaa nahin he
 Many platforms are intermediaries, and sometimes agencies also demand data
 bhartiya rigerv bank ne april, 2018 main achaanak aadesh diya ki bharatiyon ke bhugtan se sambandhit sabhi data keval bharat main sangrahit kiye jaaenge or maange jane par us data tak acces bhi deni hogi
 Without privacy laws, payment data can become a tool of harassment
 grih mantralay ne maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta or sarkaar kii mukhar aalochak tista sitalwad ke khilaaf 2014 main kiye gaye ek vivaadaaspad khulaase main kathith taur par videshi fund se credit card bill ke bhugtan kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 It was said that Teesta bought 'personal items like sanitary napkins' from foreign funds
 haal ke varshon main kai mantralayon, agenciyon or niamakon ne apane nagarikon ke data ke lokation, acces or niyantran kii maang kii he
 And India does not even have any kind of protection from privacy law
 do saal pehle 2017 main supreme court ke aitihaasik faisle ke baavjood gopneeyata kanoon nahin ban paaya he
 a ten-member committee introduced a draft Privacy Bill in July 2018
 yah bill agle satr main sansad main pesh kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah baat to saal bhar se suni ja rahi he
 The report of the Privacy Committee is titled 'A Free and Fair Digital Economy' - privacy was mentioned only in the second line
 prastaavit gopneeyata vidheyak main sarkaar ko data collection or uski processing main vyapak chhot or bade paimaane par uski nigaraanee kii anumati di gai he
 But the Home Ministry pressured government agencies to give more powers
 isliye jab hamaare paas gopneeyata kanoon hoga, to usamen sarkari agenciyon ko kai tarah kii chhot hogi
 It also proposes that all 'sensitive personal data' and passwords be stored in India
 sochie, aapke jimail, fasebuk yaa web hosting sarvice ke password bharat main hi store kiye jaaen or sarkaar jab chaahe use dekh sakati he? (darasal, password kahin bhi 'store' nahin kiye jate
 ) Even if the data becomes accessible to government agencies, the danger to the people will increase
 jimail ko bharatiyon ke email bharat main hi store karne par majaboor kiya jaae to siarpisi kii dhara 91 ke tahat koi thana prabharee bhi use hasil kar legaa
 The Internet is a global network of networks that anyone can access from anywhere
 ab ham simaaon ke daayre main bandhe ek nae yug ke rashtravaadi internet kaa nirmaan kar rahe hai
 Where will it stop? In Uttar Pradesh? According to a report, the Uttar Pradesh government wants Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, whatsapp, Flipkart and similar institutions to store the data of the people of Uttar Pradesh in the data centers of Noida because the state is 'protecting the data of its citizens' Wants to be the first Indian state
 yani upi police or yogi sarkaar is data tak apni pahunch aasaan bananaa chaahati he
 And then it will pose a risk to poor and less literate people
 modi sarkaar kii nakadi kii jagah digital bhugtan kii ucch praathamikta vaali niti kaale dhan par prahaar to kar sakati he lekin isse nae logon ke liye sambhavit ghotaale, chalbaasiyon or nuksaan ke dwaara khul gaye hai
 Again, Aadhaar has also raised a number of concerns
 khaskar data li yuidi ke mutabik nijee, asaamaajik tatv karte hai
 But with the database, the police or government agency can get a complete list of Muslims or Sikh residents of that village as soon as they enter the name of a village
 aapaki aasthaa nijee maamla he, lekin hamaare yahaan koi gopneeyata kanoon nahin he
 Even if we enacted a law, the government will get an exemption and it will be said that your data is not yours
 is varsh farvari main vaanijya mantralay ne 'indiaj data for indiaj deveopment' sheershak se ek rashtriya i-commers niti kaa masauda taiyaar kiya tha jo kahata he ki data ek rashtriya sampatti he or sarkaar kaa is par niyantran hona chahie
 But the 'new age data deemed oil' is more related to business
 aarthik surveykshan 2018-19 main main kaha gaya tha ki data, janhit main nijee kshetra ko bechaa ja saktaa he
 In the Rajya Sabha, the government reported on 8 July that it had granted access to 87 private and 32 government institutions to India's database of car registrations and driving licenses for Rs 65 crore
 lekin yah to rajnatik dalon ke liye data ke phaayde ke mukaable oont ke munh main jira jaisaa he
 With the right algorithm, data can be helpful in the game of democracy
 is khel kaa ek pratik he—cambridge analitica
 The British political consultancy firm influenced US elections and the Breguit vote through Facebook and Big Data Analytics
 bharat ke chunaavon main farji khabaren badi bhoomika nibhaati hai, magar votaron ko lubhaane main hard data or analytics kii usase badi bhoomika ho sakati thi
 For example, the ruling party should decide to reach 22 crore beneficiaries of government schemes just before the election
 kya aap soch sakate hai ki vishalkay parde par vibhinn rangon ke 22 karod chote-chote dots hai, jo dhire-dhire bhagava rang main badal rahe hon?haa, loktantr main matadaata aaj jitna asurakshit he utana kabhi nahin tha
 They are no more than a billion colored dots appearing on a giant digital dashboard and with the help of analytics and AI algorithms, its color can be changed as and when desired
 prashanth ke
 Roy is a technology writer and policy consultant *** nae saal ko aae abhi paanch hi din beete hai ki bengaluru galat vajahon se surkhiyon main aa gaya he
 The city, generally considered a 'safe' city for girls, came into the limelight due to a CCTV footage showing a girl being molested during New Year celebrations
 yahi nahin, is maukey par bengularu main kai ladakiyon ke saath chhedchhad kii ghatana saamne ai he jisane ek baar phir mahilaon kii suraksha or kanoon vyavastha par sawaal uth gaye hai
 One such case happened with Chaitali Wasnik about whom he wrote a post on Facebook on January 1, which has now gone viral
 unki is post ko 500 baar share kiya gaya he jisamen unhone bataaya ki kis tarah unhone chhedhkhani karne vaale badmaash ko munhtod jawaab diya
 The comments is bare main chatali ne NDTV se bhi mangalvaar ko baatcheet kii thi jisamen unhone bataaya tha ki kis tarah aise mushkil vakt main madad ke liye koi pulisavaala unhen nahin mila
 On New Year's Eve, Chaitali Wasnik was returning home from her office at around 1:30 pm, just as many other girls return
 raste main jab chatali ne dekha ki do purush use ghoorte hue saamne kii disha se uske raste main aa rahe hai, to usne bhi vahi kiya, jo aamtaur par sabhi ladkiyaan kiya karti hai - vah ek kone main ho gai, taaki unhen jane kaa rasta mil sake
 By the way, what happened to Chaitali in Indiranagar in western Bengaluru, a similar incident happened with many girls and women on MG Road, considered the city's most luxurious commercial area
 vahaan hazaron log nae saal kaa jashn manaane ke liye ekatra hue the, or sharaab ke nashe main dhut yuvakon ne ladakiyon ko dabocha, chhedaa, un par fabtiyaan kaseen, unka peechha kiya
 All these actions were recorded on 45 security cameras, and in the footage released on social media, the women were seen crying and calling for help
 police ne is maamle main chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 On this, Chaitali also spoke to NDTV on Tuesday, in which he told how no policeman got him to help in such difficult times
 nae saal kii purv sandhya par chatali vaasanic raat ko lagbhag 1:30 baje apane daftar se ghar laut rahi thim, jaise bahut-si anya ladkiyaan lautati hai
 On the way, when Chaitali saw two men staring at her, coming in her path from the front, she did the same thing that all girls usually do - she got into a corner, so that they had to go the way
 So to receive
 vaise, jo kuch chatali ke saath pashchimi bengaluru ke indiranagar main hua, aisi hi harakat shahar ke sabase shandaar commercial ilaaka maane jane vaale emji road par bhi bahut-si ladakiyon or mahilaon ke saath hui
 Thousands of people gathered there to celebrate the New Year, and alcohol-addicted youths grabbed, teased, punched them, chased them away
 45 security camaron main ye sabhi harakatein record huin, or soshal media par jari hui footage main mahilaon ko rote or madad ke pukaarte dekha gaya
 Police has arrested four people in this case

 supreme court ne soshal media par afvaahen failaane, charitra hanan karne, trol karne, dhamkee dene ityadi ko lekar sarkaar se teen hafte ke bheetar guideline banane ko kaha he
 It has been said by the government that work is going on on this, but the time limit cannot be told
 supreme court ke justise deepak gupta ne niztaa ko lekar kai sawaal uthaae
 The questions were valid but one more question
 supreme court ne bheed kii hinsa par behad vistrut aadesh die the
 From the police station to the DGP, accountability was fixed, the mob violence did not stop and no action was taken against any DGP
 kya guideline banane se soshal media kaa raajnneetik istemaal ruk jayega
 If the government's own IT cell spreads false things, trolls someone, do you really hope that action will be taken against them through a guide line
 abhi bhi paryaapt kanoon hai magar iti cell ke logon ke khilaaf karrwai kaa ricard behad karaab he
 The mps have been caught trolling till nothing happened because their party is in government
 justise deepak gupta ne kaha ki kisi ne aapattijanak post daali to us tak pahunchane kaa zariyaa to hona hi chahie
 It will be in the cognizance of the honorable court that no concrete action has been taken against many such people, but such people are followed by the big officials of the government
 adaalat jaananaa chaahati he ki kisi massej kaa mul nirmaataa koun he
 It can be detected, sometimes it is also known but there is no action
 afvaahen failaana, kisi ko trol karnaa yah raajnneetik sanghathan kaa mul kaam ho gaya he
 They should not be spared by shifting this problem to a common man, if the court wants a complete solution to this problem
 use iti cell ke polytical trol kii baat kerani chahie
 However, i am talking about a real news
 bharat ke chotii ke das koparative bank main se gine jane ek bank kii khabar ne uske khataadharakon ko sadak par utaar diya he
 As soon as the news came that the Reserve Bank had taken Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank under its supervision and ordered that the account holders of PMC Bank can withdraw only 1000 of their total deposits in 6 months
 agar aapako pataa chale ki aap apane acount se chah maheene main ek hi hazaar nikaal sakate hai to aap tivi par hindu muslim dibet dekhenge, aaj kal pakistan par dibet dekhenge yaa bank ke branch kii taraf bhaagenge
 The same thing happened
 jaise hi yah khabar logon tak pahunchi, ve branch kii taraf bhaagane lage
 His senses flew that if all the money was lost
 mumbai main is bank ke branchon ke baahar log tut pade
 There are 81 branches in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane and Palghar
 log bank pahunch kar hangaamaa karne lage ki unka paisa waapas mili
 Many people have accounts in this bank
 chah maheene main agar ek hazaar hi nikaal sakenge yah soch kar in par kya biit rahi hogi
 Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank has branches in seven states
 goa, dilli, madhya pradesh, gujarat, aandh pradesh or karnataka main iske branch hai
 Mumbai is its headquarters
 5 xxrep 4 0 se adhik iske khatadharak hai
 As of March 2019, PMC Bank had 11,600 crore deposits
 log koparative bank main isliye bhi paisa rakhte hai kyonki vahaan byaaz adhik miltaa he
 So along with looking at the interest rate, also see what is the real situation of this bank
 lekin aam aadmi par yah zimmedaari kaise di ja sakati he
 When such banks are opened under the rules of the government, it becomes the responsibility of the government and the bank not to cheat the customer
 aapako to pataa hi he ki agar bank dub gaya yaa bank kaa license radd ho gaya to aapkaa sara paisa dub jaataa he sirf ek lakh kii adhiktam raashi milegi
 Any money after one lakh will be drowned
 duniya bhar main sabase kam he
 If the bank drowns in Malaysia, the account holder will get up to 60,000 thousand dollars
 bharat main maatr 1400 dollar hi
 In Canada, Switzerland, France, more than 75 thousand dollars to 1 million dollars will be found
 america main bhi bank doobane par khataadharan ko dhai lakh dollar mil jaaenge to bharat main yah 1400 dollar kyon he
 That is why it is up to 1 lakh only
 zyaadaatar desho main aapke khate main jamaa 60 se 70 pratishat paisa surakshit he lekin bharat main bahut hi kam
 Nonetheless, Mumbai Bank's PMC Bank's NPA was increased
 jiske kaaran iskaa laabh kam ho gaya
 Many also suggest that money should be kept in different banks
 1993 tak bank doobane par 30,000 hi milane kaa niyam tha
 That year it was increased to 1 lakh
 1993 se yah ek lakh hi he
 If you look at this amount according to inflation, today it should be five and a half lakh but only one lakh will be received
 vaise is par chintaa karne kii baat nahin he
 Between 1913 and 1955, 1489 banks in India failed, but there have been no commercial banks since decades
 yah sari jaankaree hamane hindu bijness line kii radhika marvin kii report se lee he
 Therefore, we understand the concern of these account holders
 jab tak koi thos aashwaasan nahin milegaa inhen yahi lagegaa ki paisa dub gaya
 What will be the condition of those who have kept more money? reserve bank ke aadesh ke baad piemasi bank ab koi nayaa lone nahin de sakegaa
 Neither will be able to invest
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki reserve bank ke aadesh kii copy har khatadharak ko bheji jaae
 To be placed on the bank's website
 bank ke prabandh nideshak ne khataadharakon ko bharosa dilaayaa he ki chah maheene ke pehle sari gadabadiyaan thik ho jaaengi lekin un khataadharakon kaa kya jinhen kal 1000 se adhik kii zarurat pad sakati he
 Why are they being punished for six months? kya bank khataadharakon kii vajah se mushkil main padaa he
 Even if these news do not get a place in the media, but people know that their money has become unsecured
 isliye ve raat aath baje tak andheri branch ke baahar jamaa the
 They have not been to their home
 sochie is vakt 50 hazaar logon par kya guzar rahi hogi or media pakistan par charchaa chalaakar logon ko bargalane main laga he
 Greta Tunbar's speech is being widely discussed in the United Nations
 neuyark main sanyukt raashtra kaa jalwaayu sammelan chal rahaa he
 The Vice Chancellor of Germany tweeted his photo with Greta
 is twit ke baad unki aalochana bad gai ki koyale ke istemaal ko khatm karne ke liye germany paryaapt kadam nahin uthaa rahaa he
 The French President has described Greta's views as radical and said that her anger about governments is not right
 america ke raashtrapati donald trump ne grata ke bhaashan kaa ek hissaa twit kiya or uski sari koshishon ko halke main liya he
 It is said that she seems a happy girl whose future is bright
 kaha ja rahaa he ki trump ne grata kii sari koshishon ko maatr yaheen tak samet diya he
 Germany, France, Argentina, Brazil and Turkey
 grata sahit 15 bacchon ne sanyukt raashtra main paanch deshon ke khilaaf shikaayat bhi kii he ki ye paanch desh un bacchon ke maanavadhikaar kaa ulanghan kar rahe hai
 Greta's speech is being heard with interest
 aap sabhi ne apni khokhli baton se mere bachapane ke sapane chin liye hai
 How dare you
 'nae aankadon ke hisaab se koi samaadhaan yaa yojanaayen yahaan pesh nahin kii gayi kyonki ye aankade aapke liye asuvidhajanak hai
 You are still not mature enough to dare to say what it is
 aap hamen chal rahe hai
 But young people are understanding your deception
 bhavishya kii peedi kii nigahen aap par hai
 If you continue to expect us, we will never forgive you
 ham aapako jane nahin denge
 We are drawing a streak right now
 duniya jaag rahi he, badlaav aa rahaa he, chahen aap pasand karen yaa na karen
 'these are the words of Greta Tunbar
 grata lagaataar apane bhaashanon main duniya ke hukmaranon ko chalange kar rahi he ki sirf baaten ho rahi hai, kaam kam ho rahe hai
 Trump trumps the science of climate crisis
 asweekaar karte hai
 Brazilian President Bolsenaro said that there is no threat to the forests of Amazan
 jangal tabah nahin hue hai
 While the whole world saw the destruction of the fire there
 bolsenare to yahaan tak kah gaye ki emezan dharti kaa fefda nahin he
 Scientists have spread the wrong thing
 jalwaayu sammelan main bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa bhaashan hua
 He did not mention Greta in any way
 grata kii ek baat sahi he
 Half the incomplete action is being taken on climate change
 naare ban jate hai magar niti kabhi zamin par lagu nahin hoti he
 An example of this is the sewage treatment plant of Faridabad
 yah isliye he taaki gande naalee kaa pani saaf kar de or yamuna maili hone se batch jaae
 In January 2015, the National Green Tribunal ordered that the Yamuna should be cleared by 31 March 2017
 aaj tak nahin hui
 In July 2018, the National Green Tribunal formed a committee under the chairmanship of Shailaja Chanda
 yah report engiti kii site par he
 Sushil Mahapatra has studied it
 is report ke anusaar faridabad main chaar astipi plant hai
 But all four are not working properly
 19 lakh aabaadi he faridabad kii
 Here, 210 MLD of water comes out from the houses and industry, whereas the cleaning capacity of the four STP plants is only 160 MLD
 million litre par de
 Think if the STP plants here are not functioning at full capacity then what will happen to the Yamuna
 is report main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki greater faridabad main koi bhi sivej treetment plant nahin he
 While there are more than 50 housing societies here
 susheel mahapatra ne faridabad ke pratapgarh ilaake main sthit sabase bade sivej treetment plant kaa gauge liya
 The condition of the plant is very bad
 jis vakt susheel gaye vahaan bijli ke chali jane ke kaaran plant band tha
 Anyway, this plant does not work at its full capacity
 yahi nahin pataa chalaa ki is plant main rasayanon kii safai kii kshamta nahin he
 He just stops dirty stuff, clothes and mud
 pani main jo rasayan mila hota he use saaf karne kaa koi plant nahin he
 When the same chemical water is used in agriculture, cancer is left inside people's body
 itane gambhir masale par hamaara ravaiya kitna dhulmul he
 In May 2019 'down to Earth' Banjot Kaur wrote a report about Namami Gange
 us report main kaha tha ki sivej treetment plant kaaphi badi chunauti he
 There were 68 sewage treatment plants to be set up under Namami Gange but by August 2019 only 6 plants could be fully operational
 amitabh bachchan ko is saal kaa dada sahib phalke puraskaar die jane kii ghoshnaa hui he
 It has been 50 years since Amitabh Bachchan played the role on screen
 khwaaja ahamed abbaas kii film 'saat hindustani' se unki film yatra shuru hoti he
 It would not be right to cover 50 years of film journey in a few lines here
 77 saal kii umr main bhi amitabh sakriy hai
 We shoot all night
 is samay 'koun banegaa karodpati' kii shooting main vyast hai
 The list of his successful-unsuccessful films is very long
 unka abhinay sansar bahut hi bada he
 He has completed the journey of very good movies to average and average to very bad films like a smooth traveler
 amitabh 70 ke dashak main anti establishment hero ke rup main ubhare lekin jaldi hi ve is chhavi se baahar aa gaye
 His hit films kept on coming, but he kept coming in the middle of films like 'kabhi Kabhi', 'bemisaal', 'silsila' and became a hero of calm nature
 abhitabh bachchan ke abhinay ke alag alag shades hai
 Did not see Amitabh of 'paa', 'pink', 'piku', 'chini Kam', 'black', 'bhootnath' with Amitabh of 'anand', 'miley', 'abhimaan' and 'chupke-chupke'
 can go
 in sabake abhitabhi 'diwaar', 'janzir' or 'mukaddar kaa sikandar', 'sharaabi', 'kuli', 'mard' or 'don' ke amitabh se kaaphi alag hai
 His fans were also surprised to see Amitabh of 'storm', 'magician' and 'shahenshah', 6 Bade Miyan Chhoti Mian ',' Aaj Ka Arjun ',' Ajuba ', 6 Ganga Jamuna Saraswati'
 'suryavansham' kaa zikr yahaan karnaa thik nahin hoga
 This film is shown so many times that people are afraid to forget the rest of their films
 aisa na ho ki duniya ko lage ki amitabh ne ek hi film main kaam kiya he or wo he 'suryavansham'
 Once films were written for them, but now they work easily in a film written for someone else
 darasal agar kaam ke paimaane ke hisaab se dekhen to amitabh kaa udhaaharan bahut bada he
 He also acts like a normal actor with a new director
 samay par aate hai or nirdeshak ke ishaare par kaam karte hai
 Amitabh became a good actor over time
 dhalate ja rahe hai
 Pulse polio campaign was brought home by Amitabh Bachchan
 bachchan ke prashansakon kaa apana ek sansar he
 They gather outside his house every Sunday to have darshan and Amitabh does not disappoint him whenever he is in his house
 samay kam he varna amitabh bachchan kii bhashaa par bhi alag se likhaa bolaa ja saktaa he
 Amitabh had established a new Hindi in the public space through Kaun Banega Crorepati
 ve apni bhashaa ko lekar kaaphi satark praani lagate hai
 Speak both English and Hindi with respect and with proficiency
 bachchan kii bhashaa kaa jawaab nahin
 Congratulations on receiving the Dadasaheb Phalke Award

 When this woman made a noise, nearby people gathered there, the accused gave money to the woman and said that the matter should be revived
 mahila kii shikaayat par police ne aaropee yuvak ko giraftaar kar liya he
 However, Sangeeta did not prove to be as fortunate as the security officer and her ticket for the assembly election was cut
 uttar pradesh ke bagpat main sharaab pi rahe kuch logon ne ek yuvak kii hatya mahaj isliye kar di, kyonki usne unase sharaab maangi thi
 After committing the murder, the accused first hid the body in his own house and later burnt it to erase identity
 16 disambar ko hui is vaardaat kaa khulaasa karte hue police ne aaropee ko giraftaar kar liya he
 According to the information, some people of the village were drinking alcohol on the night of 16 December in Khatta Prahladpur village of Chandinagar area of the district

 narendra modi kii tarif karne vaale basapa (bahujan samaaj party) ke saansad par gaaj gir sakati he
 It is being told that Mayawati is very upset with this MP
 basapa ke pravaktaa or pradeshdhyaksh swami prasad maurya ne saansad vijay bahadur singh ke bayaan ko puri tarah se khaarij kiya or kaha ki party adhyaksh mayawati ne khud iskaa sangyaan liya he
 Bahujan Samaj Party MP Vijay Bahadur is an MP from Hamirpur
 vijay bahadur singh ne shuukravaar ko elahabaad main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii khule dil se tarif kii thi
 The MP had said that Modi has made a lot of development in Gujarat and he has spoken of non-violence by giving a statement of sadness when the dog comes under the car, so every Indian should welcome his statement
 vijay bahadur singh ne kaha, 'narendra modi ne hinduon ke bare main jo kuch kaha he, yahi hinduon kaa vishwaas or aacharan he
 Common Hindus believe that this is the reality, so everyone should welcome it
 koi bhi hindu qurbaani to karata nahin he, unhone kaha he ki meri gaadi se kutta bhi dab jaataa he to mujhe dukh hota he, unhone apane dil kii baat kahi he or acchhee baat kahi he
 This man is against violence, that's a good thing, everybody should welcome it
 kattar hindu kaa kya matlab he? ek safal rajaneta hai wo, jisane gujarat ko oonchaaiyon par chadha diya he, puure hindustan kii factory gujarat ja rahi he, vahaan solar energy aa gai he, vahaan choubison ghante bijli aa rahi he, yahaan sirf das ghante bijli aati he
 We want the whole of India, who can do this, who can bring reality to the ground, it is welcome
 ' saansad vijay bahadur singh ne yah bayaan to de diya, magar unki party ne hi unke is bayaan kaa swaagat nahin kiya
 On Saturday in Lucknow, the party's state president Swami Prasad Maurya said that he is not the spokesperson of the party, hence he is not authorized to make such statements and it is a matter of direct indiscipline
