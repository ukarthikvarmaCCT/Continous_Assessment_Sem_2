poochne par bataaya ki rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ne anumati nahin di
 Not only this, in the petition, Sinha has alleged that when a search was going on at the house of Deputy SP Devendra Kumar on October 20, CBI Director Alok Verma received instructions to stop the search
 poochne par jawaab mila ki rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ne aisa karne ko kaha he
 After all, what is the case, how far does it go that the career of four CBI IPS officers is at stake in this regard, the name of National Security Advisor is coming, what do they have to do with CBI, why did they interfere? They are giving, the name of Union Minister of State is coming, now the name of Law Secretary and Cabinet Secretary will also come
 apni yachika main em ke sinha ne aarope lagaaya he ki ro ke afasar samant goyal kaa phone tap kiya gaya to ek recording main samant kah rahaa he ki is cese ko piemo yani pradhanmantri karyaalay manage kar rahaa he
 The day of the conversation, according to the petitioner, the same night all the investigating officers related to Asthana's case were transferred
 sibiai ke diaiji em ke sinha ne likhaa he ki asthana cese ke shikayatakarta sanaa satish babu ne moin kuraishi cese main sivisi chif ke ve choudhary se mulaakaat kii thi
 On November 11, Law Secretary Suresh Chandra also contacted Satish Sana and they were trying to influence the case when the Supreme Court ordered the CVC to investigate the matter
 aapako yaad hoga ki asthana maamle main dubai ke vyapaaree manoj prasad ko jab arest kiya gaya tab bassi ko special cell ke disipi se phone aata he, bassi phone nahin uthaate hai
 Later another Inspector gets a call asking about Manoj's arrest and says that the Cabinet Secretary had asked to be asked
 kevi choudhary sivisi, suresh chandara vidhi sachiv or pi ke sinha cabinet sachiv, ye log kiski taraf se poochtacha kar rahe the, jab rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar kii nazar main sab kuch ho hi rahaa tha tab
 Was anyone apart from Ajit Doval taking interest in this case, was he not confident of Ajit Doval, who is that, for a Minister of State, all this cannot happen
 aap thodaa or sochie
 We know that all these allegations are there but when Joint Director Manish Kumar Sinha has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against such powerful people
 desh ke sabase taqatvar shaks pradhanmantri modi ke karyaalay or unke mantri, suraksha salaahkaar, cabinet sachiv, koun he jo ab bachaa hua he
 After all, what is this game? kya ab bhi ham bevakoof banaae ja rahe hai yaa koi sanstha bachi hi nahin he jo ab is sach ko saamne laa sake
 Law Secretary Suresh Chanda has given his response, stating that 'this is a complete lie
 main kabhi landan nahin gaya
 i do not know Satish Sana nor Rekha Rani
 yah puri tarah se managasaint he
 ' kya vaaki kanoon sachiv suresh chandara rekha rani ko nahin jaanate hai, jo ki ek iees afasar hai
 It was Rekha Rani who called Satish Sana that the Law Secretary wanted to talk
 unka landan kaa number diya
 In the same conversation, the Law Secretary told Sana that the message of Cabinet Secretary PK Sinha is that the government will save you, but on November 13, there will be a change
 vidhi sachiv sanaa se milanaa chaahate the
 The Law Secretary has denied this and said that he did not go to London
 magar aarope itnaa bhi kamazor nahin hai
 The CBI DIG has written in the petition that on 13 November, the Law Secretary called Sana again and contacted him through Rekha Rani
 abhi tak rajya mantri kaa koi bayaan nahin aayaa he or na hi is par bijepi ne koi press conference kii he
 Randeep Surjewala of Congress has raised questions in the context of this petition
 aap is yachika ko padhenge to dimag chakkar kha jayega
 The minister, who is accused of taking bribe of several crores, is also accused of interfering in the case of CBI officers through the Ministry of Personnel
 carmik mantralay main unke zarie ye sab ho rahaa he jinhen sibiai ke nideshak report karte hai
 Now when you find out who Alok Verma reports to the Ministry of Personnel, whose minister is Jitendra Singh, you will be shocked
 aap jaanate hai ki supreme court ne kendriya satarkta ayukta ke ve choudhary ko rakesh asthana or alok verma ke maamle main jaanch kii baat kahi thi
 By the way, the CVC itself had to take the matter to its end but well
 sibiai ke sanyukt nideshak em ke sinha kii yachika main sivisi kii bhoomika par bhi sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 Satish Sana, the complainant in the Asthana case, met VC Chaudhary of the CVC
 us samay ke ve choudhary ke rishtedaar ke saath milane gaya tha jinka hyderabad main deepies skool he
 This meeting was held in Delhi
 choudhary ne asthana se poocha tha ki satish sanaa ke khilaaf kya kya saboot hai
 Asthana said that there is not much evidence against Sana
 sawaal he agar sivisi kii bhoomika bhi sandigdh ho jaae to kaise koi bharosa kare ki asthana or alok verma main jaanch kisi hastkshep se prabhavit nahin hui hogi
 If the CVC had met Satish Sana with his relative somewhere in Delhi, it is a very serious charge
 is yachika main ek or angel aa gaya he
 Nitin Sandesara
 dubai ke vyapaaree manoj prasad ko asthana maamle main giraftaar kiya he
 That Manoj Prasad told that he has met Nitin Sandesara of Sterling Biotech in London
 nitin sandesra bhi gujarat kaa ek hira vyapaaree he
 Nitin Sandesara is accused of bank fraud worth Rs 5300 crore
 gujarat ke vadodara main isaki ek company he
 Sandesara fled to Saudi in August itself
 24 sintabar 2018 ke times aaf india ne khabar likhi thi ki usne nigeria kii naagarikta le lee he jiske saath bharat kaa pratyrpan kaa qaraar nahin he
 The same news appeared in the Indian Express on 25 September
 aap apane hindi akhbaar palat kar denkhen, vahaan ye sab kuch khabar nahin milegi
 Therefore, the petition of DIG MK Sinha cannot be dismissed as such
 nitin sandesra puure khandaan ke saath bhaaga tha
 Brother-in-law all went to Nigeria
 is maamle main andhra bank ke purv nideshak anup garg ke khilaaf dhokhadhadi kaa maamla darj he
 Sandesara is accused of forming 300 shell companies
 inke zarie 5000 karod kii herapheri kii he
 Now see what is the problem of anyone telling the name of the banks, who has not returned millions of crores of loans
 aaj kendriya soochna ayukta ne reserve bank of india or pradhanmantri karyaalay kii khinchaai kii he, pehle bhi khinchaai kar chukaa he
 But no one is making any difference
 tippaniyan Now come to the Media Test Tool Kit
 ek hi din ke akhbaar main aap is tul kit ko aazamaa sakate hai
 You will see all Hindi newspapers on Tuesday i
e
 November 20
 hamane aapako media test tul-kit bataaya tha
 You have to see three things
 is khabar ko pehle panne par jagah di gai he yaa nahin, heading main saamaanya baaten hai yaa rajya mantri or rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal kii bhoomika ko bhi pramukhataa se chapa gaya he
 Has this news been dealt with in a two-column or did the Minister take money from whom, the Cabinet Secretary phoned for whom, the Law Secretary called, whom did Alok Verma stop whose arrest
 kis panne par khabar chhapi he isse pataa chalegaa ki akhbaar main kitni himmat bachi he, heading se praathamikta kaa pataa chalegaa or detail se cese ke bare main
 Hindi newspapers are not printing many such news
 chhapate bhi hai to bas routine tip, detail nahin bataate hai isliye unki samiksha bahut zaruri he jaise aap ham tivi waalon kii karte hai
 Rather, also look at the TV channels whether the things stated in this petition have been conveyed to you
 supreme court main 20 november ko bhi is maamle kii sunwaayee he
 The court has also asked DIG MK Sinha to appear
 manish kumaar sinha, sibiai main kai mahatvapurn cese dekh rahe the
 Are experienced officers
 sibiai main diaiji hai or haal hi main 23 aktubar kii raat inkaa bhi dilli se nagpur tabadalaa kar diya tha
 Manish Kumar Sinha filed a petition in the Supreme Court on 19 November and made all these allegations
 ek ipies afasar ne modi sarkaar ke mantri par kai karod kii rishwat lene kaa aarope lagaaya he
 In the first 15 days of June 2018, this money has been given to Haribhai Parthi Bhai Chaudhary, Minister of Modi Government
 isse judaa aarope to or bhi khataranaak he
 In this bribe Moin Qureshi case, the investigating officer was running a recovery racket, money has been given in connection with the same
 jaldi se ham aapako moin kuraishi cese ke bare main bataa dete hai
 Moin Akhtar Qureshi is a meat merchant
 inkaa maamla 7 saal se chal rahaa he, teen nideshak is dauraan aae magar yah maamla anjaam tak nahin pahunchaa
 In 2011, the investigation started in the UPA government, it went away, the Modi government came and the matter is there, rather his own Minister of State has come to the stand
 is dauraan sibiai ke teen-teen nideshak aa kar chale gaye magar moin akhtar kuraishi kaa maamla anjaam par nahin pahunchaa
 Rahat Fateh Ali Khan came to the wedding of Moeen Qureshi's daughter, was caught at the airport with 56 lakhs cash while returning
 is maamle ko lekar loksabhaa chunaav main pradhanmantri modi ne congress par aarope bhi lagaae
 Three years after his government, the CBI registered a case
 magar isaki jaanch ne sibiai ko bheetar se ulat diya
 The names of two CBI directors came up during the investigation
 or ab isi cese ke silsile main alok verma or rakesh asthana aamane saamne hai
 Director AP Singh retired from CBI and became a member of UPSC from where he had to be removed
 satish sanaa moin kuraishi kaa hi dost tha or kuraishi maamle main bhi aaropee he
 Sana is accused in the case of bribing Asthana
 sanaa ne hi aarope lagaaya tha ki usne tidipi ke saansad siem ramesh ke zarie sibiai ke nideshak alok verma ko 2 karod diya tha
 Rakesh wanted to interrogate Asthana Sana, who was not allowed by Alok Verma, it is alleged
 magar jab sanaa ne apana bayaan darj karaayaa to kaha ki usne disambar 2017 main rakesh asthana ko 3 karod diya he
 Through Dubai businessman Manoj Prasad and his brother Somesh Prasad
 isi bayaan ke aadhaar par asthana ke khilaaf exiaar hui
 Manoj Prasad was arrested in Delhi
 ipies afasar manish kumaar sinha ne pradhanmantri modi ke mantri par kai karod rishwat ke aarope isi cese ke silsile main lagaae hai
 It is not normal that the CBI DIG not only accused the Minister of State for Coal and Mining, Mr
 Haribhai Parthi Bhai Chaudhary for taking bribe but also accused the Prime Minister's Office and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval in their petition in writing
 Huh
 is cese main dakhal dene or prabhavit karne ke liye
 Manish Sinha has said that the Asthana case he was looking at, was removed and transferred to Nagpur because powerful people were being saved at the behest of the PMO
 sabooton se chhedchhad ho sake
 Manish Sinha was also looking into the case of Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi
 kya rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal ne asthana kii jaanch main dakhal di he, kya unhen bachaane ke liye asthana ke yahaan chhapemari se lekar phone zabt karne se roka he? manish kumaar sinha ne apni yachika main likhaa he ki asthana ke khilaaf jaanch main kai staron par rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ne gatirodh paidaa kiya
 The two middlemen involved in the case were close to Ajit Doval
 dubai ke middle main manoj ke zarie hi asthana ko paise dene kaa aarope laga tha, giraftaar ke baad manoj ne hairaani jataai thi ki use kaise sibiai pakad sakati he jabaki wo ajit dobhaal kaa kareebi he
 His brother Somesh and RAW officer Samant Goel helped Ajit Doval in a personal case
 asthana ke khilaaf jaanch se lekar exiaar ke str par ajit dobhaal dilchaspee le rahe the
 It is written in the petition that an FIR was lodged against Asthana on October 5, which was reported by Alok Verma to Ajit Doval on October 17
 sawaal he ki alok verma ajit dobhaal ko kyon bataa rahe the ki asthana ke khilaaf exiaar hui he or ajit dobhaal asthana ko kyon bataa rahe the ki tumhaare khilaaf exiaar darj hui he
 Did Asthana plead with Ajit Doval that he should not be arrested and Ajit Doval saved Asthana from being arrested, it is written in the petition, the denial will not make any difference, this matter is now further from investigation It is done
 yachika main likhaa he ki ajit dobhaal ke dabaav main asthana ke ghar search karne kii anumati nahin mili or unke mobile phone ko zabt nahin kiya gaya
 Investigating officer AK Bassi has alleged, MK Sinha has written all this in his petition that Alok Verma, on being asked, said that the National Security Advisor did not allow the confiscation of cell phones
 22 aktubar ko alok verma se aupchaarik darkhwaast kiya gaya magar phir anumati nahin mili
 When asked, the National Security Advisor did not give permission
 yahi nahin yachika main sinha ne aarope lagaaya he ki jab 20 aktubar ko dipti es pi devendra kumaar ke ghar search chal rahi thi tab sibiai ke nideshak alok verma kii taraf se search rokane kaa nirdesh aayaa
 When asked, the reply was received by the National Security Advisor asking them to do so
 aakhir yah cese kya he, iske taar kahaan tak jate hai ki is silsile main sibiai ke chaar-chaar ipies afasaron kaa kariyar daanv par laga he, rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar kaa naam aa rahaa he, unka sibiai se kya lenaa dena he, wo kyon dakhal de rahe hai, kendriya rajya mantri kaa naam aa rahaa he, abhi vidhi sachiv or cabinet sachiv kaa bhi naam aayega
 In his petition, MK Sinha has alleged that while the phone of RAW officer Samant Goyal was tapped, in a recording, Samanta is saying that the PMO, ie Prime Minister's Office, is managing the case
 jis din kii yah baatcheet he, yachikakarta ke anusaar usee raat asthana ke cese se jude sabhi jaanch adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 CBI DIG MK Sinha has written that Asthana case complainant Sana Satish Babu met CVC Chief KV Chaudhary in the Moin Qureshi case
 11 november ko vidhi sachiv suresh chandara ne bhi satish sanaa se sampark kiya tha or ve us samay cese ko prabhavit karne kaa prayaas kar rahe the jab supreme court ne sivisi ko is maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh die the
 You will remember that when the Dubai businessman Manoj Prasad was arrested in the Asthana case, Bassi gets a call from the DCP of Special Cell, Bassi does not pick up the phone
 baad main ek anya inspector kaa phone aayaa he jo manoj kii giraftaar ke bare main poochta he or kahata he ki cabinet sachiv ne poochne ke liye kaha tha
 KV Chaudhary CVC, Suresh Chandra Law Secretary and PK Sinha Cabinet Secretary, on whose behalf these people were questioning when everything was happening in the eyes of the National Security Advisor
 kya ajit dobhaal se bhi alag koi is cese main dilchaspee le rahaa tha, kya uskaa bharosa ajit dobhaal par nahin tha, koun he wo, ek rajya mantri ke liye to yah sab nahin ho saktaa he
 Think a little more
 hamen pataa he ki yah sab aarope hai magar itane taqatvar logon ke khilaaf joint diarector manish kumaar sinha ne supreme court main yachika di he aisa kab hua he
 The most powerful person in the country, who is left now, the office of Prime Minister Modi and his minister, security advisor, cabinet secretary
 aakhir ye khel he kya
 Are we still being fooled or is there no institution left that can now bring this truth to the fore
 kanoon sachiv suresh chanda ne apni pratikriya di he, kaha he ki 'yah puri tarah se jhooth he
 i have never been to London
 main satish sanaa ko nahin jaanata or na hi rekha rani ko
 It is completely concocted
 ' Is Law Secretary Suresh Chandra really not aware of Rekha Rani, who is an IAS officer
 rekha rani ne hi satish sanaa ko phone kiya tha ki vidhi sachiv baat karnaa chaahate hai
 Gave him the London number
 usee baatcheet main kanoon sachiv ne sanaa ko bataaya ki cabinet sachiv pi ke sinha kaa messej he ki sarkaar tumhen bachaayegi lekin 13 november ko badlaav hoga
 The Law Secretary wanted to meet Sana
 vidhi sachiv ne isse inkaar kiya he or kaha he ki ve landan nahin gaye the
 But the charges are not so weak
 sibiai ke diaiji ne yachika main likhaa he ki 13 november ko vidhi sachiv ne sanaa ko phir phone kiya or rekha rani ke zarie sampark kiya tha
 So far, there has been no statement of the Minister of State nor has the BJP made any press conference on this
 congress ke randeep surajevaala ne is yachika ke sandarbh main sawaal uthaae hai
 If you read this petition, your mind will get dizzy
 jis mantri par kai karod rishwat lene ke aarope hai un par yah bhi aarope he ki ve carmik mantralay ke zarie sibiai ke afasaron ke maamle main dakhal dete hai
 All this is happening through him in the Ministry of Personnel, which is reported by the Director of CBI
 ab aap jab yah pataa karenge ki carmik mantralay jiske mantri jitendra singh hai, vahaan alok verma kise report karte hai to aap chakra jaaenge
 You know that the Supreme Court had asked the Central Vigilance Commissioner KV Chaudhary to investigate the case of Rakesh Asthana and Alok Verma
 vaise sivisi ko khud hi is maamle ko anjaam tak le janaa tha magar kair
 The role of the CVC has also been questioned in the petition by CBI joint director MK Sinha
 asthana maamle main shikayatakarta satish sanaa ne sivisi ke ve choudhary se mulaakaat kii thi
 k v then went to meet a relative of Chaudhary who has a DPS school in Hyderabad
 yah mulaakaat dilli main hui thi
 Chaudhary had asked Asthana what evidence is there against Satish Sana
 asthana ne kaha ki sanaa ke khilaaf bahut saboot nahin hai
 The question is if the role of the CVC also becomes doubtful, how can one believe that the investigation into Asthana and Alok Verma would not have been affected by any intervention
 agar sivisi ne apane rishtedaar ke saath dilli main kahin satish sanaa se mulaakaat kii thi to yah behad gambhir aarope he
 Another angle has come up in this petition
 nitin sandesra
 Dubai businessman Manoj Prasad has been arrested in the Asthana case
 us manoj prasad ne bataaya ki landan main sterling biotech ke nitin sandesra se mulaakaat kii he
 Nitin Sandesara is also a diamond trader from Gujarat
 nitin sandesra par 5300 karod rupee ke bank frod kaa aarope he
 It has a company in Vadodara, Gujarat
 agast main hi sandesra saudi bhaag gaya tha
 On 24 September 2018, the Times of India wrote that it had taken citizenship of Nigeria with which India has no extradition agreement
 25 sitambar ko yahi khabar indian express main chhapi he
 If you turn your Hindi newspaper, you will not get all these news there
 isliye diaiji em ke sinha kii yachika ko yun hi khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Nitin Sandesara ran with the entire family
 bhai bhabhi sab nigeria chale gaye
 In this case a case of cheating has been registered against former director of Andhra Bank Anoop Garg
 sandesra par aarope he isane 300 shell companiyaan banaai hai
 Through these, he has committed a fraud of 5000 crores
 ab dekhie bainkon kaa lakhon karod kis kis ne karz lekar nahin lautaaya iskaa naam bataane main kisi ko kya dikkat he
 Today, the Central Information Commissioner has pulled up the Reserve Bank of India and the Prime Minister's Office, even earlier
 magar kisi ko fark hi nahin pad rahaa he
 The comments ab aate hai media test tul kit par
 You can try this tool kit in a single day newspaper
 aap mangalvaar yani 20 november ke saare hindi akhbaar dekhiegaa
 We told you the Media Test tool-kit
 aapako teen chizein dekhni hai
 Whether this news has been put on the front page or not, the headings are common or the role of Minister of State and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval has also been prominently featured
 kya is khabar ko ek do kollam main nipta diya gaya he yaa mantri ne kisase paise liye, cabinet sachiv ne kisne ke liye phone kar poocha, vidhi sachiv ne kise phone kiya, kiske kehane par alok verma ne kiski giraftaar roki
 From which page the news has appeared, it will show how much courage is left in the newspaper, the headings will show the priority and details about the case
 hindi akhbaar bahut si aisi khabaron ko nahin chhap rahe hai
 Even if we print, we do not tell the routine type, details, so it is very important to review them like you do TV people
 balki tivi channelon ko bhi dekhie ki kya is yachika main kahi gai baton ko aap tak pahunchaaya gaya he
 The matter is also heard in the Supreme Court on 20 November
 court ne diaiji em ke sinha ko bhi haazir hone ko kaha he
 Moin Akhtar Qureshi is a meat merchant
 inkaa maamla 7 saal se chal rahaa he, teen nideshak is dauraan aae magar yah maamla anjaam tak nahin pahunchaa
 In 2011, the investigation started in the UPA government, it went away, the Modi government came and the matter is there, rather his own Minister of State has come to the stand

 The role of the CVC has also been questioned in the petition by CBI joint director MK Sinha
 asthana maamle main shikayatakarta satish sanaa ne sivisi ke ve choudhary se mulaakaat kii thi
 k v then went to meet a relative of Chaudhary who has a DPS school in Hyderabad
 yah mulaakaat dilli main hui thi
 Chaudhary had asked Asthana what evidence is there against Satish Sana
 asthana ne kaha ki sanaa ke khilaaf bahut saboot nahin hai
 The question is if the role of the CVC also becomes doubtful, how can one believe that the investigation into Asthana and Alok Verma would not have been affected by any intervention
 agar sivisi ne apane rishtedaar ke saath dilli main kahin satish sanaa se mulaakaat kii thi to yah behad gambhir aarope he
 Another angle has come up in this petition
 nitin sandesra
 Dubai businessman Manoj Prasad has been arrested in the Asthana case
 us manoj prasad ne bataaya ki landan main sterling biotech ke nitin sandesra se mulaakaat kii he
 Nitin Sandesara is also a diamond trader from Gujarat
 nitin sandesra par 5300 karod rupee ke bank frod kaa aarope he
 It has a company in Vadodara, Gujarat
 agast main hi sandesra saudi bhaag gaya tha
 On 24 September 2018, the Times of India wrote that it had taken citizenship of Nigeria with which India has no extradition agreement
 25 sitambar ko yahi khabar indian express main chhapi he
 If you turn your Hindi newspaper, you will not get all these news there
 isliye diaiji em ke sinha kii yachika ko yun hi khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Nitin Sandesara ran with the entire family
 bhai bhabhi sab nigeria chale gaye
 In this case a case of cheating has been registered against former director of Andhra Bank Anoop Garg
 sandesra par aarope he isane 300 shell companiyaan banaai hai
 Through these, he has committed a fraud of 5000 crores
 ab dekhie bainkon kaa lakhon karod kis kis ne karz lekar nahin lautaaya iskaa naam bataane main kisi ko kya dikkat he
 Today, the Central Information Commissioner has pulled up the Reserve Bank of India and the Prime Minister's Office, even earlier
 magar kisi ko fark hi nahin pad rahaa he
 The comments ab aate hai media test tul kit par
 You can try this tool kit in a single day newspaper
 aap mangalvaar yani 20 november ke saare hindi akhbaar dekhiegaa
 We told you the Media Test tool-kit
 aapako teen chizein dekhni hai
 Whether this news has been put on the front page or not, the headings are common or the role of Minister of State and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval has also been prominently featured
 kya is khabar ko ek do kollam main nipta diya gaya he yaa mantri ne kisase paise liye, cabinet sachiv ne kisne ke liye phone kar poocha, vidhi sachiv ne kise phone kiya, kiske kehane par alok verma ne kiski giraftaar roki
 From which page the news has appeared, it will show how much courage is left in the newspaper, the headings will show the priority and details about the case
 hindi akhbaar bahut si aisi khabaron ko nahin chhap rahe hai
 Even if we print, we do not tell the routine type, details, so it is very important to review them like you do TV people
 balki tivi channelon ko bhi dekhie ki kya is yachika main kahi gai baton ko aap tak pahunchaaya gaya he
 The matter is also heard in the Supreme Court on 20 November
 court ne diaiji em ke sinha ko bhi haazir hone ko kaha he
 IPS officer Manish Kumar Sinha has accused Prime Minister Modi's minister of several crore bribes in connection with this case
 yah saamaanya nahin he ki sibiai ke diaiji ne na sirf koyala va khanan rajya mantri shri haribhaai parthi bhai choudhary par rishwat lene ke aarope lagaae balki isi maamle main pradhanmantri karyaalay or rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal par bhi baqayda likhit rup main apni yachika main aarope lagaae hai
 To interfere and influence in this case
 manish sinha ne kaha he ki jis asthana cese ko wo dekh rahe the, usase hataakar unka tabadalaa nagpur isliye kiya gaya kyonki piemo ke ishaare par shaktishaalee logon ko bachaaya ja rahaa tha
 Evidence was possible
 manish sinha neerav modi or mehul chaukasee kaa bhi cese dekh rahe the
 Has National Security Advisor Ajit Doval interfered in Asthana's investigation, preventing Asthana from raiding and confiscating his phone to save him? Manish Kumar Sinha has written in his petition that the National Security Advisor at several levels created a deadlock in the investigation against Asthana
 is cese main shaamil do midileman ajit dobhaal ke kareebi the
 It was through Dubai middle man Manoj that he was accused of giving money to Asthana, after his arrest Manoj wondered how the CBI could hold him while he was close to Ajit Doval
 uske bhai somesh or ro ke adhikari samant goyal ne ek personal cese main ajit dobhaal kii madad kii thi
 From the investigation against Asthana to the FIR level, Ajit Doval was interested
 yachika main likhaa he ki 5 aktubar ko asthana ke khilaaf exiaar hui thi jisaki soochna alok verma ne ajit dobhaal ko 17 aktubar ko di
 The question is why Alok Verma was telling Ajit Doval that an FIR has been lodged against Asthana and why Ajit Doval was telling Asthana that an FIR has been lodged against you
 kya asthana ne ajit dobhaal se guzarish kii thi ki unki giraftaar nahin honi chahie or ajit dobhaal ne asthana ko giraftaar hone se bachaa liya, yah sab yachika main likhaa gaya he, khandan se to baat nahin banegi, yah maamla ab jaanch se bhi aage kaa ho gaya he
 It has been written in the petition that under the pressure of Ajit Doval, permission was not given to search Asthana's house and his mobile phone was not confiscated
 jaanch adhikari e ke bassi ne aarope lagaae hai, em ke sinha ne apni yachika main yah sab likhaa he ki alok verma ne poochne par kaha ki rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ne cell phone zabt karne kii anumati nahin di
 a formal request was made to Alok Verma on 22 October but permission was not granted again
 poochne par bataaya ki rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ne anumati nahin di
 Not only this, in the petition, Sinha has alleged that when a search was going on at the house of Deputy SP Devendra Kumar on October 20, CBI Director Alok Verma received instructions to stop the search
 poochne par jawaab mila ki rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ne aisa karne ko kaha he
 After all, what is the case, how far does it go that the career of four CBI IPS officers is at stake in this regard, the name of National Security Advisor is coming, what do they have to do with CBI, why did they interfere? They are giving, the name of Union Minister of State is coming, now the name of Law Secretary and Cabinet Secretary will also come
 apni yachika main em ke sinha ne aarope lagaaya he ki ro ke afasar samant goyal kaa phone tap kiya gaya to ek recording main samant kah rahaa he ki is cese ko piemo yani pradhanmantri karyaalay manage kar rahaa he
 The day of the conversation, according to the petitioner, the same night all the investigating officers related to Asthana's case were transferred
 sibiai ke diaiji em ke sinha ne likhaa he ki asthana cese ke shikayatakarta sanaa satish babu ne moin kuraishi cese main sivisi chif ke ve choudhary se mulaakaat kii thi
 On November 11, Law Secretary Suresh Chandra also contacted Satish Sana and they were trying to influence the case when the Supreme Court ordered the CVC to investigate the matter
 aapako yaad hoga ki asthana maamle main dubai ke vyapaaree manoj prasad ko jab arest kiya gaya tab bassi ko special cell ke disipi se phone aata he, bassi phone nahin uthaate hai
 Later another Inspector gets a call asking about Manoj's arrest and says that the Cabinet Secretary had asked to be asked
 kevi choudhary sivisi, suresh chandara vidhi sachiv or pi ke sinha cabinet sachiv, ye log kiski taraf se poochtacha kar rahe the, jab rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar kii nazar main sab kuch ho hi rahaa tha tab
 Was anyone apart from Ajit Doval taking interest in this case, was he not confident of Ajit Doval, who is that, for a Minister of State, all this cannot happen
 aap thodaa or sochie
 We know that all these allegations are there but when Joint Director Manish Kumar Sinha has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against such powerful people
 desh ke sabase taqatvar shaks pradhanmantri modi ke karyaalay or unke mantri, suraksha salaahkaar, cabinet sachiv, koun he jo ab bachaa hua he
 After all, what is this game? kya ab bhi ham bevakoof banaae ja rahe hai yaa koi sanstha bachi hi nahin he jo ab is sach ko saamne laa sake
 Law Secretary Suresh Chanda has given his response, stating that 'this is a complete lie
 main kabhi landan nahin gaya
 i do not know Satish Sana nor Rekha Rani
 yah puri tarah se managasaint he
 ' kya vaaki kanoon sachiv suresh chandara rekha rani ko nahin jaanate hai, jo ki ek iees afasar hai
 It was Rekha Rani who called Satish Sana that the Law Secretary wanted to talk
 unka landan kaa number diya
 In the same conversation, the Law Secretary told Sana that the message of Cabinet Secretary PK Sinha is that the government will save you, but on November 13, there will be a change
 vidhi sachiv sanaa se milanaa chaahate the
 The Law Secretary has denied this and said that he did not go to London
 magar aarope itnaa bhi kamazor nahin hai
 The CBI DIG has written in the petition that on 13 November, the Law Secretary called Sana again and contacted him through Rekha Rani
 abhi tak rajya mantri kaa koi bayaan nahin aayaa he or na hi is par bijepi ne koi press conference kii he
 Randeep Surjewala of Congress has raised questions in the context of this petition
 aap is yachika ko padhenge to dimag chakkar kha jayega
 The minister, who is accused of taking bribe of several crores, is also accused of interfering in the case of CBI officers through the Ministry of Personnel
 carmik mantralay main unke zarie ye sab ho rahaa he jinhen sibiai ke nideshak report karte hai
 Now when you find out who Alok Verma reports to the Ministry of Personnel, whose minister is Jitendra Singh, you will be shocked
 aap jaanate hai ki supreme court ne kendriya satarkta ayukta ke ve choudhary ko rakesh asthana or alok verma ke maamle main jaanch kii baat kahi thi
 By the way, the CVC itself had to take the matter to its end but well
 sibiai ke sanyukt nideshak em ke sinha kii yachika main sivisi kii bhoomika par bhi sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 Satish Sana, the complainant in the Asthana case, met VC Chaudhary of the CVC
 us samay ke ve choudhary ke rishtedaar ke saath milane gaya tha jinka hyderabad main deepies skool he
 This meeting was held in Delhi
 choudhary ne asthana se poocha tha ki satish sanaa ke khilaaf kya kya saboot hai
 Asthana said that there is not much evidence against Sana
 sawaal he agar sivisi kii bhoomika bhi sandigdh ho jaae to kaise koi bharosa kare ki asthana or alok verma main jaanch kisi hastkshep se prabhavit nahin hui hogi
 If the CVC had met Satish Sana with his relative somewhere in Delhi, it is a very serious charge
 is yachika main ek or angel aa gaya he
 Nitin Sandesara
 dubai ke vyapaaree manoj prasad ko asthana maamle main giraftaar kiya he
 That Manoj Prasad told that he has met Nitin Sandesara of Sterling Biotech in London
 nitin sandesra bhi gujarat kaa ek hira vyapaaree he
 Nitin Sandesara is accused of bank fraud worth Rs 5300 crore
 gujarat ke vadodara main isaki ek company he
 Sandesara fled to Saudi in August itself
 24 sintabar 2018 ke times aaf india ne khabar likhi thi ki usne nigeria kii naagarikta le lee he jiske saath bharat kaa pratyrpan kaa qaraar nahin he
 The same news appeared in the Indian Express on 25 September
 aap apane hindi akhbaar palat kar denkhen, vahaan ye sab kuch khabar nahin milegi
 Therefore, the petition of DIG MK Sinha cannot be dismissed as such
 nitin sandesra puure khandaan ke saath bhaaga tha
 Brother-in-law all went to Nigeria
 is maamle main andhra bank ke purv nideshak anup garg ke khilaaf dhokhadhadi kaa maamla darj he
 Sandesara is accused of forming 300 shell companies
 inke zarie 5000 karod kii herapheri kii he
 Now see what is the problem of anyone telling the name of the banks, who has not returned millions of crores of loans
 aaj kendriya soochna ayukta ne reserve bank of india or pradhanmantri karyaalay kii khinchaai kii he, pehle bhi khinchaai kar chukaa he
 But no one is making any difference
 tippaniyan Now come to the Media Test Tool Kit
 ek hi din ke akhbaar main aap is tul kit ko aazamaa sakate hai
 You will see all Hindi newspapers on Tuesday i
e
 November 20
 hamane aapako media test tul-kit bataaya tha
 You have to see three things
 is khabar ko pehle panne par jagah di gai he yaa nahin, heading main saamaanya baaten hai yaa rajya mantri or rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal kii bhoomika ko bhi pramukhataa se chapa gaya he
 Has this news been dealt with in a two-column or did the Minister take money from whom, the Cabinet Secretary phoned for whom, the Law Secretary called, whom did Alok Verma stop whose arrest
 kis panne par khabar chhapi he isse pataa chalegaa ki akhbaar main kitni himmat bachi he, heading se praathamikta kaa pataa chalegaa or detail se cese ke bare main
 Hindi newspapers are not printing many such news
 chhapate bhi hai to bas routine tip, detail nahin bataate hai isliye unki samiksha bahut zaruri he jaise aap ham tivi waalon kii karte hai
 Rather, also look at the TV channels whether the things stated in this petition have been conveyed to you
 supreme court main 20 november ko bhi is maamle kii sunwaayee he
 The court has also asked DIG MK Sinha to appear
 kya rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal ne asthana kii jaanch main dakhal di he, kya unhen bachaane ke liye asthana ke yahaan chhapemari se lekar phone zabt karne se roka he? manish kumaar sinha ne apni yachika main likhaa he ki asthana ke khilaaf jaanch main kai staron par rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ne gatirodh paidaa kiya
 The two middlemen involved in the case were close to Ajit Doval
 dubai ke middle main manoj ke zarie hi asthana ko paise dene kaa aarope laga tha, giraftaar ke baad manoj ne hairaani jataai thi ki use kaise sibiai pakad sakati he jabaki wo ajit dobhaal kaa kareebi he
 His brother Somesh and RAW officer Samant Goel helped Ajit Doval in a personal case
 asthana ke khilaaf jaanch se lekar exiaar ke str par ajit dobhaal dilchaspee le rahe the
 It is written in the petition that an FIR was lodged against Asthana on October 5, which was reported by Alok Verma to Ajit Doval on October 17
 sawaal he ki alok verma ajit dobhaal ko kyon bataa rahe the ki asthana ke khilaaf exiaar hui he or ajit dobhaal asthana ko kyon bataa rahe the ki tumhaare khilaaf exiaar darj hui he
 Did Asthana plead with Ajit Doval that he should not be arrested and Ajit Doval saved Asthana from being arrested, it is written in the petition, the denial will not make any difference, this matter is now further from investigation It is done
 yachika main likhaa he ki ajit dobhaal ke dabaav main asthana ke ghar search karne kii anumati nahin mili or unke mobile phone ko zabt nahin kiya gaya
 Investigating officer AK Bassi has alleged, MK Sinha has written all this in his petition that Alok Verma, on being asked, said that the National Security Advisor did not allow the confiscation of cell phones
 22 aktubar ko alok verma se aupchaarik darkhwaast kiya gaya magar phir anumati nahin mili
 When asked, the National Security Advisor did not give permission
 yahi nahin yachika main sinha ne aarope lagaaya he ki jab 20 aktubar ko dipti es pi devendra kumaar ke ghar search chal rahi thi tab sibiai ke nideshak alok verma kii taraf se search rokane kaa nirdesh aayaa
 When asked, the reply was received by the National Security Advisor asking them to do so
 aakhir yah cese kya he, iske taar kahaan tak jate hai ki is silsile main sibiai ke chaar-chaar ipies afasaron kaa kariyar daanv par laga he, rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar kaa naam aa rahaa he, unka sibiai se kya lenaa dena he, wo kyon dakhal de rahe hai, kendriya rajya mantri kaa naam aa rahaa he, abhi vidhi sachiv or cabinet sachiv kaa bhi naam aayega
 In his petition, MK Sinha has alleged that while the phone of RAW officer Samant Goyal was tapped, in a recording, Samanta is saying that the PMO, ie Prime Minister's Office, is managing the case
 jis din kii yah baatcheet he, yachikakarta ke anusaar usee raat asthana ke cese se jude sabhi jaanch adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 CBI DIG MK Sinha has written that Asthana case complainant Sana Satish Babu met CVC Chief KV Chaudhary in the Moin Qureshi case
 11 november ko vidhi sachiv suresh chandara ne bhi satish sanaa se sampark kiya tha or ve us samay cese ko prabhavit karne kaa prayaas kar rahe the jab supreme court ne sivisi ko is maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh die the
 You will remember that when the Dubai businessman Manoj Prasad was arrested in the Asthana case, Bassi gets a call from the DCP of Special Cell, Bassi does not pick up the phone
 baad main ek anya inspector kaa phone aayaa he jo manoj kii giraftaar ke bare main poochta he or kahata he ki cabinet sachiv ne poochne ke liye kaha tha
 KV Chaudhary CVC, Suresh Chandra Law Secretary and PK Sinha Cabinet Secretary, on whose behalf these people were questioning when everything was happening in the eyes of the National Security Advisor
 kya ajit dobhaal se bhi alag koi is cese main dilchaspee le rahaa tha, kya uskaa bharosa ajit dobhaal par nahin tha, koun he wo, ek rajya mantri ke liye to yah sab nahin ho saktaa he
 Think a little more
 hamen pataa he ki yah sab aarope hai magar itane taqatvar logon ke khilaaf joint diarector manish kumaar sinha ne supreme court main yachika di he aisa kab hua he
 The most powerful person in the country, who is left now, the office of Prime Minister Modi and his minister, security advisor, cabinet secretary
 aakhir ye khel he kya
 Are we still being fooled or is there no institution left that can now bring this truth to the fore
 kanoon sachiv suresh chanda ne apni pratikriya di he, kaha he ki 'yah puri tarah se jhooth he
 i have never been to London
 main satish sanaa ko nahin jaanata or na hi rekha rani ko
 It is completely concocted
 ' Is Law Secretary Suresh Chandra really not aware of Rekha Rani, who is an IAS officer
 rekha rani ne hi satish sanaa ko phone kiya tha ki vidhi sachiv baat karnaa chaahate hai
 Gave him the London number
 usee baatcheet main kanoon sachiv ne sanaa ko bataaya ki cabinet sachiv pi ke sinha kaa messej he ki sarkaar tumhen bachaayegi lekin 13 november ko badlaav hoga
 The Law Secretary wanted to meet Sana
 vidhi sachiv ne isse inkaar kiya he or kaha he ki ve landan nahin gaye the
 But the charges are not so weak
 sibiai ke diaiji ne yachika main likhaa he ki 13 november ko vidhi sachiv ne sanaa ko phir phone kiya or rekha rani ke zarie sampark kiya tha
 So far, there has been no statement of the Minister of State nor has the BJP made any press conference on this
 congress ke randeep surajevaala ne is yachika ke sandarbh main sawaal uthaae hai
 If you read this petition, your mind will get dizzy
 jis mantri par kai karod rishwat lene ke aarope hai un par yah bhi aarope he ki ve carmik mantralay ke zarie sibiai ke afasaron ke maamle main dakhal dete hai
 All this is happening through him in the Ministry of Personnel, which is reported by the Director of CBI
 ab aap jab yah pataa karenge ki carmik mantralay jiske mantri jitendra singh hai, vahaan alok verma kise report karte hai to aap chakra jaaenge
 You know that the Supreme Court had asked the Central Vigilance Commissioner KV Chaudhary to investigate the case of Rakesh Asthana and Alok Verma
 vaise sivisi ko khud hi is maamle ko anjaam tak le janaa tha magar kair
 The role of the CVC has also been questioned in the petition by CBI joint director MK Sinha
 asthana maamle main shikayatakarta satish sanaa ne sivisi ke ve choudhary se mulaakaat kii thi
 k v then went to meet a relative of Chaudhary who has a DPS school in Hyderabad
 yah mulaakaat dilli main hui thi
 Chaudhary had asked Asthana what evidence is there against Satish Sana
 asthana ne kaha ki sanaa ke khilaaf bahut saboot nahin hai
 The question is if the role of the CVC also becomes doubtful, how can one believe that the investigation into Asthana and Alok Verma would not have been affected by any intervention
 agar sivisi ne apane rishtedaar ke saath dilli main kahin satish sanaa se mulaakaat kii thi to yah behad gambhir aarope he
 Another angle has come up in this petition
 nitin sandesra
 Dubai businessman Manoj Prasad has been arrested in the Asthana case
 us manoj prasad ne bataaya ki landan main sterling biotech ke nitin sandesra se mulaakaat kii he
 Nitin Sandesara is also a diamond trader from Gujarat

 The question is if the role of the CVC also becomes doubtful, how can one believe that the investigation into Asthana and Alok Verma would not have been affected by any intervention
 agar sivisi ne apane rishtedaar ke saath dilli main kahin satish sanaa se mulaakaat kii thi to yah behad gambhir aarope he
 Another angle has come up in this petition
 nitin sandesra
 Dubai businessman Manoj Prasad has been arrested in the Asthana case
 us manoj prasad ne bataaya ki landan main sterling biotech ke nitin sandesra se mulaakaat kii he
 Nitin Sandesara is also a diamond trader from Gujarat
 nitin sandesra par 5300 karod rupee ke bank frod kaa aarope he
 It has a company in Vadodara, Gujarat
 agast main hi sandesra saudi bhaag gaya tha
 On 24 September 2018, the Times of India wrote that it had taken citizenship of Nigeria with which India has no extradition agreement
 25 sitambar ko yahi khabar indian express main chhapi he
 If you turn your Hindi newspaper, you will not get all these news there
 isliye diaiji em ke sinha kii yachika ko yun hi khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Nitin Sandesara ran with the entire family
 bhai bhabhi sab nigeria chale gaye
 In this case a case of cheating has been registered against former director of Andhra Bank Anoop Garg
 sandesra par aarope he isane 300 shell companiyaan banaai hai
 Through these, he has committed a fraud of 5000 crores
 ab dekhie bainkon kaa lakhon karod kis kis ne karz lekar nahin lautaaya iskaa naam bataane main kisi ko kya dikkat he
 Today, the Central Information Commissioner has pulled up the Reserve Bank of India and the Prime Minister's Office, even earlier
 magar kisi ko fark hi nahin pad rahaa he
 The comments ab aate hai media test tul kit par
 You can try this tool kit in a single day newspaper
 aap mangalvaar yani 20 november ke saare hindi akhbaar dekhiegaa
 We told you the Media Test tool-kit
 aapako teen chizein dekhni hai
 Whether this news has been put on the front page or not, the headings are common or the role of Minister of State and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval has also been prominently featured
 kya is khabar ko ek do kollam main nipta diya gaya he yaa mantri ne kisase paise liye, cabinet sachiv ne kisne ke liye phone kar poocha, vidhi sachiv ne kise phone kiya, kiske kehane par alok verma ne kiski giraftaar roki
 From which page the news has appeared, it will show how much courage is left in the newspaper, the headings will show the priority and details about the case
 hindi akhbaar bahut si aisi khabaron ko nahin chhap rahe hai
 Even if we print, we do not tell the routine type, details, so it is very important to review them like you do TV people
 balki tivi channelon ko bhi dekhie ki kya is yachika main kahi gai baton ko aap tak pahunchaaya gaya he
 The matter is also heard in the Supreme Court on 20 November
 court ne diaiji em ke sinha ko bhi haazir hone ko kaha he
 After all, what is the case, how far does it go that the career of four CBI IPS officers is at stake in this regard, the name of National Security Advisor is coming, what do they have to do with CBI, why did they interfere? They are giving, the name of Union Minister of State is coming, now the name of Law Secretary and Cabinet Secretary will also come
 apni yachika main em ke sinha ne aarope lagaaya he ki ro ke afasar samant goyal kaa phone tap kiya gaya to ek recording main samant kah rahaa he ki is cese ko piemo yani pradhanmantri karyaalay manage kar rahaa he
 The day of the conversation, according to the petitioner, the same night all the investigating officers related to Asthana's case were transferred
 sibiai ke diaiji em ke sinha ne likhaa he ki asthana cese ke shikayatakarta sanaa satish babu ne moin kuraishi cese main sivisi chif ke ve choudhary se mulaakaat kii thi
 On November 11, Law Secretary Suresh Chandra also contacted Satish Sana and they were trying to influence the case when the Supreme Court ordered the CVC to investigate the matter
 aapako yaad hoga ki asthana maamle main dubai ke vyapaaree manoj prasad ko jab arest kiya gaya tab bassi ko special cell ke disipi se phone aata he, bassi phone nahin uthaate hai
 Later another Inspector gets a call asking about Manoj's arrest and says that the Cabinet Secretary had asked to be asked
 kevi choudhary sivisi, suresh chandara vidhi sachiv or pi ke sinha cabinet sachiv, ye log kiski taraf se poochtacha kar rahe the, jab rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar kii nazar main sab kuch ho hi rahaa tha tab
 Was anyone apart from Ajit Doval taking interest in this case, was he not confident of Ajit Doval, who is that, for a Minister of State, all this cannot happen
 aap thodaa or sochie
 We know that all these allegations are there but when Joint Director Manish Kumar Sinha has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against such powerful people
 desh ke sabase taqatvar shaks pradhanmantri modi ke karyaalay or unke mantri, suraksha salaahkaar, cabinet sachiv, koun he jo ab bachaa hua he
 After all, what is this game? kya ab bhi ham bevakoof banaae ja rahe hai yaa koi sanstha bachi hi nahin he jo ab is sach ko saamne laa sake
 Law Secretary Suresh Chanda has given his response, stating that 'this is a complete lie
 main kabhi landan nahin gaya
 i do not know Satish Sana nor Rekha Rani
 yah puri tarah se managasaint he
 ' kya vaaki kanoon sachiv suresh chandara rekha rani ko nahin jaanate hai, jo ki ek iees afasar hai
 It was Rekha Rani who called Satish Sana that the Law Secretary wanted to talk
 unka landan kaa number diya
 In the same conversation, the Law Secretary told Sana that the message of Cabinet Secretary PK Sinha is that the government will save you, but on November 13, there will be a change
 vidhi sachiv sanaa se milanaa chaahate the
 The Law Secretary has denied this and said that he did not go to London
 magar aarope itnaa bhi kamazor nahin hai
 The CBI DIG has written in the petition that on 13 November, the Law Secretary called Sana again and contacted him through Rekha Rani
 abhi tak rajya mantri kaa koi bayaan nahin aayaa he or na hi is par bijepi ne koi press conference kii he
 Randeep Surjewala of Congress has raised questions in the context of this petition
 aap is yachika ko padhenge to dimag chakkar kha jayega
 The minister, who is accused of taking bribe of several crores, is also accused of interfering in the case of CBI officers through the Ministry of Personnel
 carmik mantralay main unke zarie ye sab ho rahaa he jinhen sibiai ke nideshak report karte hai
 Now when you find out who Alok Verma reports to the Ministry of Personnel, whose minister is Jitendra Singh, you will be shocked
 aap jaanate hai ki supreme court ne kendriya satarkta ayukta ke ve choudhary ko rakesh asthana or alok verma ke maamle main jaanch kii baat kahi thi
 By the way, the CVC itself had to take the matter to its end but well
 sibiai ke sanyukt nideshak em ke sinha kii yachika main sivisi kii bhoomika par bhi sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 Satish Sana, the complainant in the Asthana case, met VC Chaudhary of the CVC
 us samay ke ve choudhary ke rishtedaar ke saath milane gaya tha jinka hyderabad main deepies skool he
 This meeting was held in Delhi
 choudhary ne asthana se poocha tha ki satish sanaa ke khilaaf kya kya saboot hai
 Asthana said that there is not much evidence against Sana
 sawaal he agar sivisi kii bhoomika bhi sandigdh ho jaae to kaise koi bharosa kare ki asthana or alok verma main jaanch kisi hastkshep se prabhavit nahin hui hogi
 If the CVC had met Satish Sana with his relative somewhere in Delhi, it is a very serious charge
 is yachika main ek or angel aa gaya he
 Nitin Sandesara
 dubai ke vyapaaree manoj prasad ko asthana maamle main giraftaar kiya he
 That Manoj Prasad told that he has met Nitin Sandesara of Sterling Biotech in London
 nitin sandesra bhi gujarat kaa ek hira vyapaaree he
 Nitin Sandesara is accused of bank fraud worth Rs 5300 crore
 gujarat ke vadodara main isaki ek company he
 Sandesara fled to Saudi in August itself
 24 sintabar 2018 ke times aaf india ne khabar likhi thi ki usne nigeria kii naagarikta le lee he jiske saath bharat kaa pratyrpan kaa qaraar nahin he
 The same news appeared in the Indian Express on 25 September
 aap apane hindi akhbaar palat kar denkhen, vahaan ye sab kuch khabar nahin milegi
 Therefore, the petition of DIG MK Sinha cannot be dismissed as such
 nitin sandesra puure khandaan ke saath bhaaga tha
 Brother-in-law all went to Nigeria
 is maamle main andhra bank ke purv nideshak anup garg ke khilaaf dhokhadhadi kaa maamla darj he
 Sandesara is accused of forming 300 shell companies
 inke zarie 5000 karod kii herapheri kii he
 Now see what is the problem of anyone telling the name of the banks, who has not returned millions of crores of loans
 aaj kendriya soochna ayukta ne reserve bank of india or pradhanmantri karyaalay kii khinchaai kii he, pehle bhi khinchaai kar chukaa he
 But no one is making any difference
 tippaniyan Now come to the Media Test Tool Kit

 Has this news been dealt with in a two-column or did the Minister take money from whom, the Cabinet Secretary phoned for whom, the Law Secretary called, whom did Alok Verma stop whose arrest
 kis panne par khabar chhapi he isse pataa chalegaa ki akhbaar main kitni himmat bachi he, heading se praathamikta kaa pataa chalegaa or detail se cese ke bare main
 Hindi newspapers are not printing many such news
 chhapate bhi hai to bas routine tip, detail nahin bataate hai isliye unki samiksha bahut zaruri he jaise aap ham tivi waalon kii karte hai
 Rather, also look at the TV channels whether the things stated in this petition have been conveyed to you

 The court has also asked DIG MK Sinha to appear

 The audience showed special affection for the Indian Test captain

 After this, the spectators also traveled from the stadium
 jo darshak maujuud the unamem schuli bachche adhik the jinhen muft main pravesh diya gaya tha
 The Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association's (UPCA) greed to offer free laddus and memorable t-shirts of the 500th Test match did not attract cricket lovers to the stadium
 police prashasan ne bhi tikat or paas kii jaanch karne main thodi dheel barti
 Entering the entire family on a ticket was also seen
 suraksha kadi thi or isliye pulicekarmi adhik dikhaai die
 The VIP road of Green Park is always closed by night by police by barricading but it remained open for vehicles like normal days before and during the match

 He says that most of the students were enthusiastic about taking these items but due to the opening of schools and colleges, the number of students and children remained negligible

 bas unhen suraksha jaanch ke baad stadium ke andar aane diya jaae
 So they are not checking tickets too much, just letting people in after security check

 bhartiya test captain ke prati darshakon ne vishesh lagaav dikhaaya
 The audience did not feel disappointed after Cheteshwar Pujara's dismissal as Kohli stepped to the crease but was dismissed early
 iske baad darshak bhi stadium se kooch karne lage
 The audience who were present had more school children who were given free entry
 uttar pradesh cricket sangh (upisie) kaa muft main laddu or 500wein test match kii yaadgaar tishart dene kaa laalach bhi cricket premiyon ko stadium main nahin khinch paaya
 The police administration also relaxed a little to check the ticket and pass

 Vendors selling flag-tshirts outside Green Park were also disappointed with the lack of enthusiasm in the audience
 aise hi ek vendor amit ne bataaya ki vah subah chaar baje se stadium ke baahar khadey hai abhi tak do tishart hi biki hai
 Even those carrying India's flags and wrist bands are just a few spectators
 vah kehete he ki sabase zyada in saamaanon ko lene ke liye utsaah schuli chaatro or bacchon main hota tha lekin skool-college khule hone ke kaaran chaatro or bacchon kii sankhya na ke baraabar rahi
 The comments green park ke get number 8 par khadey ek police adhikari ne bataaya ki adhikariyon kaa aadesh he ki stadium main aane vaale darshakon ke saath zyada sakhti na barti jaae
 Just let them come inside the stadium after security check

 DNA asked Rishi what he thought about the popular award show, so he said, "I can't believe it, when recently she gave Parineeti Chopra an award for losing weight
" 
 
 kya kripaya koi mujhe bhi vazan badhaane ke liye award de saktaa he
 
 
 ? "in the interview, it seemed as if Rishi was referring to the 'style Icon of the Year' award given to Parineeti during the Stardust Awards ceremony in December last year
 rishi ne aise puraskaron kii vishwasaneeyata ko lekar apni baat vistaar se samajhane ke liye intervyuu ke dauraan kaha, "maine lokapriy puraskaron main kabhi vishwaas nahin kiya

 This bridge is at an altitude of 32 meters above the water level of Brahmaputra
 khaas baat yah he ki is tarah kii takanic se sweden or denmark ko jodne vaale pul ko banaaya gaya he
 The superiority of the technology of the Bogibeel bridge can be gauged from the fact that the technology was taken from Denmark to build it, while Germany tested it
 rail mantralay ke diarector infarmeshan and publicity veda prakashbogibil pulko lekar kaaphi ashanvit hai unka kahana he ki yah pul purvottar main vikaas kaa pratik sabit hoga
 Apart from this, this area will become a very useful means of movement
 unhone kaha ki chini seemaa par tainaat sashastr balon ko bhi bogibil se kaaphi sahuuliyat ho jaaegi
 According to railway officials, to go from Dibrugarh to Arunachal Pradesh by train, a person has to go through Guwahati
 or iske liye use takreeban 600 kilometre se adhik kii duuri tay kerani hoti he
 With the construction of this bridge, this journey will be much easier
 1985 main hue assam samjhaute ke mutabik bogibil pul ko brahmaputra ke upar banane ke liye centre sarkaar ne sahmati jataai thi
 After 11 years, the Bogibeel Bridge was approved in 1996 itself
 lekin iskaa nirmaan kaary 2002 main atal bihari vaajapei kii sarkaar ne shuru kiya tha
 In 2007, the UPA government declared it a national project
 assam ke dibrugarh ko arunachal ke pasighat se jodne vaale bharat ke sabase lambey or ranneetik taur par mahatvapurn bogibil pul kaa kaam 2002 se shuru hone ke baad kaaphi dhimaa pad gaya tha
 The special thing is that the Congress government had targeted to inaugurate it in 2009, but it could not happen
 2014 main modi kii sarkaar banane ke baad bogibil pul par teji se kaam shuru hua or aaj puraa hone kii sthiti main najar aa rahaa he
 The Bogibeel bridge is being built on the Brahmaputra River, 17 km from the city of Dibrugarh
 bogibil pul kii anumaanit laagat 5800 karod rupee he
 With the construction of this bridge, the railway lines on the southern side and northern side of the Brahmaputra will be connected
 brahmaputra ke dakshini kinare par maujuud chal khova or moraan hot railway stesan taiyaar ho chuke hai
 On the other hand, the railway line coming from Rangia has been extended to the northern part of Bogibil Bridge
 brahmaputra nadi ke uttari hisse par stesan taiyaar ho chukaa he
 Railway line has also been laid
 tangaani or dhamal railway stesan bogibil pul ke jariye aapas main jud jaaenge
 The Brahmaputra River is a large river in the Dibrugarh region
 yah nadi itani badi he ki yahaan par kilometre tak isaki chaudaai maapi jaati he
 The Brahmaputra river is tied to two embankments near Bogibeel village
 10 kilometre chaudee nadi ko baandh kar 5 kilometre ke andar sameta gaya he
 Large pieces of iron have been added to it by welding the river

 The best cement has been used to build this bridge
 project ke chif ejeeniyar ke mutabik bogibil pul ko kaaphi majboot banaaya gaya he
 The reason is that this area of brahmaputra falls in the most dangerous zone in terms of earthquake
 lihaaja pul ko 8 se zyada magnitude ke bukamp ko sahane ke kaabil banaaya gaya he
 The pillars of this bridge have been made so strong, that the biggest floods of the Brahmaputra have no impact on it at all
 bogibil kaa pul bharat ke liye ranneetik taur se kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 The bridge will play an important role in providing all-time connectivity to the Indian Army and security forces to all parts of Arunachal and Assam
 iske jariye arunachal main kai jagahon ko railway line se sidhaa joda ja sakegaa
 The Government of India has already announced the laying of the railway line for Tawang
 aise main bogibil pul arunachal ko puri taur se bhartiya railway ke alag-alag steshnon se jodne kaa kaam karegaa
 Even after the two big companies like Vodafone and Idea are united, no such plan has come out from their end, so that Jio's kingship can end
 haalanki ab vodaphone ne apane preeped yugers ke liye ek nayaa 159 rupee vaala plan pesh kiya he
 This plan will compete with the Rs 149 plan of Airtel and Jio
 airtel kii tarah hi vodaphone bhi apane is plan main 28 dinon kii validity ke saath pratidin 1GB data de rahaa he
 That means customers will get a total of 28GB of data in it
 data ke alaava graahakon ko pratidin 100 SMS or puri validity ke dauraan analimited wais kol kaa phayda bhi milegaa
 On the other hand, if you talk about Jio, then the company has a validity of 28 days as well as 1 daily

 United Nations sources informed that the United Nations imposed a ban on him on 10 December 2008 after the UN imposed all-round pressure on Hafiz Saeed, the head of the banned jamaat-ud-dawa
 bataa den ki 26 / 11 ke mumbai hamale main 166 log maare gaye the
 After which India waged a global war against terrorism
 bharat lagaataar hafiz said or pakistan main sakriy antkavaadi sanghathanon ko pratibandhit karne ko liye yuan main dabaav bana rahaa tha

 uttar pradesh main vibhinn aaropon main jelon main band mananeeyon ko ab apane ilaake kii jelon main rahane kii tamanna jaag uthi he
 In view of this desire, the government is also planning to move forward in this direction
 lakh take kaa sawaal yah he ki hatya or balaatkaar jaise sangeen aaropon ko lekar jelon main band dabang or bahubali vidhayakon ko unke ilaake kii jelon main bhejne or unhen sukh suvidhaayen die jane kii maang kahaan tak jaij he?varisht tikaakaron kii maane to apane ilaake kii jelon main rahane ke dauraan aaropee vidhayakon ko apni hanak dikhaane, apane dhan-bal or network kaa puraa istemaal karne tathaa tamaam tarah kii suvidhaon ke upbhog karne kii puri chhot mil jaati he
 He has all sorts of interests behind his district jail
 uttar pradesh main chal rahe maujuuda vidhansabha satr ke dauraan is baat kii maang kii gai ki jab tak dosha sabit na ho jaae tab tak aaropee saansadon or vidhayakon ko jelon main vishesh suvidha kaa darja diya jaae or unhen unke nirvachan kshetron main sthit jelon main hi rakhe jane kii vyavastha kii jaae
 Meanwhile, State Jail Minister Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya also said that the government can consider this demand
 sawaal yah uthta he ki gambheer aaropon main jelon main band vidhayakon ko sarkaar itani khaas tavajjo kyon dene ja rahi he
 How far is it legitimate to demand special facilities within jails? Many legislators are lodged in various jails in Uttar Pradesh, from murder of MLA to all kinds of serious charges
 kya unhen jelon main dher sari suvidhaayen isliye muhaiyaa kara di jaaen kyonki vah janpratinidhi hai
 Why can't the public representatives be treated like a common prisoner? The extent of the assembly was met when Prison Minister Raja Bhaiya pleaded with the Chief Minister to get independent MLA Mukhtar Ansari jailed in Agra in his area
 Assured upto vidhansabha main congress ke varisht netaa pramod tiwari ne prashn ke jariye yah maang kii thi ki britishkaal ke dauraan jail yaatnagrih the, lekin ab unhen sudhaar grih mana jaataa he
 This is the natural principle of justice that no one is considered guilty until the blame is proved
 bahut se saansad or vidhayak bhi vibhinn dfaaon main jelon main band kiye jate hai or baad main adaalat se ve nirdosh sabit ho jate hai
 Former Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police Ishwar Chandra Dwivedi said in conversation that such things are being raised so that the land can be prepared for its future
 dvivedi badi safagoi se kehete hai ki ab soochna ke adhikaar kaa jamaana aa gaya he

 Now if a mafia is connected to Banaras and taken away several hundred kilometers away and locked in another prison, then its network is definitely affected
 dvivedi ne kaha ki iske peeche safataur par manshaa yahi he ki is tarah ke upaay kiye jaaen or kanoon main badlaav kii baat kii jaae taaki bhavishya main yadi kisi tarah kii naubat aae to iskaa phayda uthaaya ja sake

 Last year, with the help of Rangana Herath's excellent bowling, the Sri Lankan team defeated the Australia team 3–0 on their soil
 yuvaaon se saji srilankai team ko dekhakar ek baargi yah laga tha ki ve apni cricket main acha sudhaar karte hue sahi disha kii ore aage bad rahe hai
 But later it proved to be an illusion
 unhen dakshin africa main karaari haar jhelni padi or yahaan tak ki apane ghar main hi ve bangladesh se ek test haar gaye
 The deterioration continued
 pichley maheene ve zimbabwe jaisi ranking main behad neeche vaali team ke saamne bhi jujhate najar aae or ab team india ne unhen 3-0 se haraa diya he
 Even weaker than the current Sri Lanka team Ranji team, Sunil Gavaskar, who is currently in Sri Lanka as an expert, has beaten the hosts for their poor performance
 unhone kaha, sach main kahuun, to aap ise test match nahin kah sakate
 The Indian team was not tested at all
 yah srilanka team kisi bhi ranjai team ke saamne juujhati najar aegi
 Gavaskar hoped that the Sri Lankan team would learn from their mistakes and improve their game
 is haar kaa srilanka tik kii ranking main gaharaa prabhaav padegaa
 Gavaskar is not completely wrong, because nowadays Ranji teams are also playing the best cricket
 choton se jujh rahi srilanka team ne bhartiya team ke khilaaf thodaa sa damakham dikhaaya
 Apart from this, he was seen putting his arms in front of the Indian team every season
 pehle test main bhi pari se haar sakati thi srilankaapako bataa den ki srilanka bharat ke haathon do baar lagaataar pari se haar jhelni padi
 It could also have been lost by the third innings
 agar viraat kohli ne pehle test match main srilanka ko foloan khilaa diya hota
 The worst happened in the Pallekele test
 jahaan srilanka team ne teen din ke bheetar kii sarender kar diya
 The threat of defeat was looming on them when they were all out for 135 in response to India's 487 runs in the first innings

 bharat kaa vishwa main sabase bada raksha sauda itihaas main shaayad sabase dhimi raftaar se aage badaae vaale saude ke rup main darj ho
 India decided to deal with France's Rafael Jungi jet two years ago, after an extremely tedious selection process of 11 years to replace its aging mig-21 fleet
 lekin ab chayan prakriya kii hode main duusare number par rahe germany kii aguai vaale europea gathjod ne sasti dar vaale eurofiter typhone kii peshkash karke spardhaa ko nae sire se daavat di he
 India Today has been quoted by sources as saying that the Modi government is considering the offer from Germany, while Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is in the process of finalizing the aircraft manufacturing agreement in France with Rafale manufacturer France Dassault Company
 126 jet vimaanon ke liye rafel ke saude kii anumaanit keemat 20 arab euro (1
 6 lakh crore Rs
 ) he, jo dashak bhar main adaa kerani he
 Within weeks of the BJP government taking over power at the Center, representatives of the German government began negotiations with the new offer, so that the France deal could go awry
 nai peshkash se das saal kii avadhi main keemat 20,000 karod ru
 May decrease till sutron ke mutabik, ‘shiyaayat’ itani tagdi he ki sarkaar ke upree halkon main halchal much gai he
 The new formal offer was made in early July to Defense Minister Arun Jaitley
 baad main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko isse avgat karaayaa gaya
 The total current price of this new offering (if the estimated price of the entire fleet at the current price) is 10
 5 arab euro se thodi hi zyada baithti he jabaki france ke saude kii keemat isse ek arab euro zyada padati he
 When calculated based on the company's fixed price (or the amount to be paid in ten years) the price of Germany 17
 5 arab euro baithti he
 In 2012, Eurofighter was believed to be worth more than 21 billion euros
 isi vajah se france daud main aage pahunch gaya
 Since then there has been a long period of negotiations between Dassault and HAL for the joint production of war jets
 ab jab donon ke bich takneekee or vyavsaayik baatcheet antim daur tak pahunch chuki he, yah sauda hi khatai main padataa dikh rahaa he
 The German offering comes from Eurofighter's manufacturer Airbus Defense & Space
 haalanki raksha mantralay ke kharid niyamon main keemton main sanshodhan kii koi gunjaaish nahin he
 Experts believe that the amount of Germany's concession is so large that the government may be tempted to rethink the cost of France
 yah peshkash shaayad badi europea takaton ke bich baari kootnithik gahamagahami kaa hi nateeja he
 The interest of these European countries in Germany-led alliances has increased due to the huge amount of deal and the possibility of employment generation in them
 saude par punarvichaar kii sambhaavna kaa andaja us vakt laga, jab bharat main germany ke rajdoot maaikel stiner june ke shuru main bijepi sarkaar ke aalaa netaaon se mili
 He came to know that the new government was considering a re-evaluation of the deal in exchange for the UPA government approving the agreement, while Germany consulted its allies Britain, Spain and Italy about the new offer
 nai peshkash centre sarkaar ke paas pahunchane ke chaar din pehle francisi videsh mantri laurent fabius ne nai dilli main bhartiya netaaon se mulaakaat kii thi
 The French side was disappointed to see India's wavering attitude towards the deal
 is peshkash ke kuch din pehle 24 june ko jetali ne rafel saude par apni pehali tippanee main kaha tha ki sarkaar saude par ‘soch-samajhakar faisla’ legi
 This contrasted with the UPA government's stand that negotiations with the French side were in the final stages
 mana jaataa he ki rafel saude ke teji se aage na badaae kii ek vajah purv raksha mantri e
 K
 antni kii hichkichaahat thi
 They probably did not agree with the controversial price calculation of the Indian Air Force which was estimating inflation at its projected rates and found the French deal cheaper
 saude ke pratispardhiyon kaa aarope he ki francisi vyavsaayik peshkash ‘adhuri’ he or bhartiya paksh dasalt ke uplabdh karaae aankadon se keemat aank rahaa he jisaki bharat ke vittiya visheshgyon ko jaanch-parakh kerani chahie
 According to experts, the possibility of Eurofighter returning to the competition will be difficult in the absence of provisions to reconsider the deal
 raksha mantralay main purv vittiya salaahkaar (adhigrahan) or institute for dephence studies and anolysis ke visheshgy amit kushish kehete hai, “main kisi badlaav kii prakriyaagat yaa rajnatik sambhaavna nahin dekhtaa
 The government can do whatever it wants but neither will it be practical, nor wise
 sarkaar ke liye yah faisla mushkil or jhenp bharaa ho saktaa he ki francisiyon ko do saal tak intjaar karvaa kar kisi or se sauda kar le
 "since France had taken a large-scale political initiative for this deal, India may have to bear the brunt of it
" france raksha upkarnon kii bharat ko aapurti karne ke maamle main teesraa bada desh he
 Among the major deals with him are the Scorpene submarine and the Mirage 2000 fleet upgrade
 lekin germany kii nai peshkash se madhyam shrenee ke bahuaiami jangi vimaan (mmrsie) ko lekar anischitata paidaa ho sakati he
 This is the technical name of the Rafale deal
 lekin yah bhartiya vaayu sena ke liye acchhee khabar nahin he kyonki yah project tay avadhi se do saal pichad chukaa he or uski jagah rus ke paanchavin peedi ke ladaaku vimaan (exfee) or swadeshi halke ladaaku vimaan (elsie) jaisi donon hi pariyojnaayen reng rahi hai
 Obviously, the story of a very high deal has changed, but it will be in India's interest that the process of modernization of the Air Force is not pending in the wake of government lethality

 The CBI and the Enforcement Directorate have started a rapid investigation in the Punjab National Bank Mahaghotale case
 is maamle kii nai-nai paraten khulti ja rahi hai
 As new things are coming out in this scam, it seems that it may involve not only the employees of PNB, but also the employees of other banks related to this case including Allahabad Bank and Axis Bank
 bhartiya rigerv bank ke purv nideshak vipin malik ne yah ashanka jataai he
 How did the 90-day lou last for 1 year? Former RBI director Vipin Malik spoke to Aaj Tak about the matter
 unhone sawaal uthaaya ki jab bhi koi bank letters of anderteking (lou) jari karata he, to vah sirf 90 dinon ke liye hota he
 But this is the first case where lou or letter of credit has been given for 12 months
 duusare bainkon ne bhi kii laaparvaahiunhone bataaya ki niyamon ke mutabik aisa hona sambhav nahin tha
 Malik said that when the other banks, including Axis Bank and Allahabad Bank, would have reached this 1-year lou, their ears should have been raised automatically
 unke man main sawaal uthne shuru ho jane chahie the ki aakhir 1 saal kii bank guarantee kahaan se ai he
 But nothing like this happened and it was ignored
 malik ne ashanka jataai ki is maamle main sirf pienbi ke karmchaaree nahin, balki duusare bainkon ke karmchaaree bhi shaamil ho sakate hai
 He said, however, that the curtain will arise when the investigation of the matter is completed
 RBI kaise chook gaya?malik ne is maamle ko lekar kai sawaal uthaae
 He said that the investigation being done by the Reserve Bank of India has not been revealed yet, but the Reserve Bank keeps an eye on the SWIFT system

 In this case, why did it not fall into rbi's grip
 unhone kaha ki in sab halaaton ko dekhne se pataa lagata he ki kahin-na-kahin badi chook jarur hui he
 It is clear that few people have not done this work, many people are in it
 jo alag-alag str par is maamle main mili hue hai
 Vipin said that Punjab National Bank uses software called Finacle
 unhone kaha ki mere khyaal se yah software infosis yaa wipro ne lagaaya he
 There are two things in it - one, Core Banking System (CBS) and SWIFT
 ye donon chijen ek-duusare se judi hoti hai
 If SWIFT is connected to CBS, then all the details can be found through it
 audit kyon nahin hua?is detail main yah saaf pataa chal jaataa he ki aakhir client koun he
 What is his limit client ne baaki bainkon se kitna paisa liya hua he
 How much is owed kahin difolter to nahin
 In this system, if something is outside the limit, then SWIFT will not take action on it
 unhone kaha ki jab bhi koi fahrren tranjaction hota he, to uskaa audit hota he
 How did he remain audited in this case? The former RBI director said that when the rules are not followed, there is a possibility of it being defaulted
 aise main is tarah kii herapheri kii ashanka apneaap bad jaati he
 In this case, it is clear that the bank employees have ignored the rules

 Input: IANS rajkumaari jodhabai ke astitv ko lekar tamaam tarah kii bhrantiyaan hai
 She is commonly mentioned as the wife of the Mughal emperor Akbar and the mother of Jahangir, but there have also been reports of Jodha Bai being fictional

 Historians have introduced Jodha Bai from their own perspective
 jodhabai ke jivan ko bollywood film 'jodha-akbar' main aishwarya raay bachchan ne behtareen tareeke se parde par pesh kiya he
 In his book 'portuguese India and Mughal Relations 1510-1735', the writer of Goa, Louise de Assis Coria, states that Jodha Bai was actually a Portuguese woman named Dona Maria Mascarenhas, who came through the Portuguese ship via the Arabian Sea and whom In the mid-1500s, Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat was captured and presented to Emperor Akbar
 donna ke saath unki bahan juliana bhi thim
 Correa said on the sidelines of the book's launch in Panaji, "when Dona Maria reached Akbar's court, Akbar fell in love with her
 us vakt akbar kii umr 18 varsh or donna kii 17 varsh thi
 Akbar was already married, despite this, he became enamored of Donna and kept him and his younger sister Juliana in his harem
 " Correa says, "the Portuguese and Catholics could not accept that a person from their community lived in the harem, while the Mughals on the other hand could not accept that the Firangi (christian) community (who from the beginning had spoken against the Mughals) Was) the woman became the wife of the Mughal

 pradhanmantri ne twit kar kaha, kisi insaan kaa mandir bananaa hamaari sabhyataa nahin he, mandir banane se mujhe dukh hua he
 i urge people not to do this
 piem ne twit main yah bhi likhaa ki agar aapke paas samay or sansaadhan hai, to ise 'svachh bharat' ke sapane ko puraa karne main lagaaein

 yogi sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko apane sau din puure kar liye
 On this occasion, the government claimed a drop in the crime graph over the previous year
 in daavon par dam bharte hue yogi sarkaar puure josh main najar ai lekin soobe kii police kii ore se jari kiye gaye aankadon par gaur karen to sarkaar ke in daavon kii hakeekat kuch or hi najar ai

 The Yogi government released figures claiming the decline in the crime rate in the state
 sarkaar ke mutabik, pichhali sarkaar ke inhen sau dinon or yogiraj ke in sau dinon main hatya main 4
 43 percent, 6 in dowry murders
 68 fisadi, sadak par aparaadh main 100 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 Apart from this, 12 also in SCST Crime
 43 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 In fact, the Yogi government forgot to throw light on the graph of crimes like robbery, robbery, kidnapping for ransom and rape
 rajya main kai fisadi badha krime rateupi police ne 15 march se 15 june ke bich soobe main hue aparaadh par jo aankade saamne rakhe hai, unke mutabik, soobe main hui sangeen vaardaaton kii fehrist main shaayad hi koi kami ai he
 Moreover, the crime rate has been destroyed by completely crossing the previous figures
 upi police ke aankadon ke mutabik, 15 march se 15 june tak in teen maheenon main dakaiti ke maamle 13
 85 percent, loot 20
 46 fisadi, phiroti ke liye kiye gaye apharan 44
 44 per cent and 40 in rape cases
 83 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he
 The government and the police themselves are entangled, on the declining graph of killings in the state, the figures of the Yogi government are definitely matching with the UP police
 magar baaki aparaadhon par chuppi saadh lenaa shaayad sarkaar kii kaaryakshmata par gambhir sawaal khadey kar rahaa he
 This is the reason why the government did not consider it appropriate to talk about these rising crime figures, counting its achievements for 100 days
 baharhaal in aankadon ke pher ko sulajhane kaa daawa karte hue yogi sarkaar or unki police khud kaaphi uljhe hue najar aa rahe hai
 When Yogi Adityanath was sworn in as the 21st Chief Minister of the state on March 19, 2017, while giving the slogan of fear-free rule, perhaps the people of UP are confident that the crime in the state is now sure Will pass through yogi sarkaar ection main ai or tabadatod faisle liye gaye
 The Yogi government formed an anti-romeo squad over claims of women's safety, but the squad remained mired in controversies over its working practices

 chittorgarh ke nivasee jaiprakash dashora kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ko is aitihaasik imaarat ko bachaane ke liye kathor se kathor qadam uthaane chahie
 But after the issue arose in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly, the Rajasthan government has now become cautious
 mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne kaha he ki durg ko bachane ke liye har tarah kaa prayaas kiya jayega
 Talking to NDTV, Minister Rajendra Rathore said that the mining leases will be reviewed and plans will be made for rehabilitation of the fort
 unhone kaha, 'mukhyamantri ji ne sadan main aashwast kiya he ki chittorgarh ke durg ko sangrakshit hi nahin rakhaa jayega balki uske puratathvik mahatva ko dekhte hue usko or thik karne ke liye sarkaar sakriy rup se sahyog karegi
 The mining leases issued by the previous government around the fort will also be reviewed
 lekin sawaal ye he ki 2013 main jab rajasthan hoicourt ne durg ke 10 kilometre ke daayre main khanan par roak lagane ke aadesh die the, to yahaan blasting karke limestone khanan kaa kaam sarkaar kii naak ke neeche kaise chalata rahaa? The pavilion is the most important in the marriage procession in Hindu way
 mandap kaa matlab mahaj aam ke pattey laga phoos kaa chappar bhar nahin hota, iske saath sakshi hote hai ve devtaa jinka aahvaan karke unhen bulaayaa jaataa he
 The gods give their blessings to the bride and groom entering new life and witness their marital bond
 ab badale daur main paramparaon kaa jaise-jaise aadhunikeekaran hota gaya, vaise-vaise mandap par bhi iskaa asar dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Due to this formality, the demand for readymade pavilion has increased now
 hitech or bhaagam-bhaag vaali jindagi kaa hissaa ban chukaa insaan ab rasmon ko bhi apane andaaj main sametane laga he
 According to religious customs, marriage ceremonies begin with the pavilion
 iske liye purohit din va samay nishchit karte hai
 The pavilion, which is buried at the appropriate time, honors the auspicious time after the wedding
 manyata he ki shaadi ke shubh muhoort par purohit ke aavahan par sabhi devtaa mandap ke neeche virajman rahete hai or vaivaahik jode ke liye sukhi vaivaahik jivan ke dwaar kholte hai
 There was a time when Kanyapaksha used to have great enthusiasm and sense of responsibility regarding the pavilion
 mandap ko itani ahyimat di jaati thi ki iske liye ghar ke bade-bajurg pehle se hi taiyaariyon main jute jate the
 Such beliefs have been considered in society since the beginning
 lekin vakt ke saath aae badlaav kaa asar he ki aaj logon ne mandap kaa doosraa formula taiyaar kar liya he
 Due to the increasing population, shrinking houses and confined spaces, the pavilion is being erected in some way in some corner of the marriage hall, then in such an open field, the pavilion is being made in a place where only the limited people of the bride and groom side
 In order to be present, other places are being used for wedding arrangements, stage and catering
 darasal, mandap ab peeche chhutata ja rahaa he or shaadi kaa sara aakarshan ‘jaymaal’ or deje tak simatata ja rahaa he
 At the same time, the pavilion is now full of formality for the fans
 shaadi ke anya intjaamon ke saath-saath tent vaale ko mandap kaa bhi jimmaa saunp diya jaataa he, jiske karigar aanan-fanan main minuton main mandap taiyaar karke chale jate hai
 Even if the girl's side is worried about the rest of the wedding arrangements, the mandap usually does not become a concern anymore
 vahiin dahej rahit vivaahon ke samarohon main to saikadon mandap thok ke bhav ek saath mangaaye jate hai or shaadiyaan samaapt hone ke baad sabhi mandap uth jate hai
 Pt on the messing up of traditions krishnadev shukla kehete hai ki mandap kaa mahatv log bhul rahe hai or jane-anjaane main dharmik paramparaon se khilwaad kar rahe hai
 This can lead to bad luck in the marital life, but due to the problem in the overbearing lifestyle, people are looking for alternatives
 shukla ke mutabik, radimaid mandapon kaa upyog parampara ke lihaaj se thik nahin he
 Especially as it is being commercialized, the traditions are being left behind and the pavilions are also becoming part of the Khanapurti
 dilli main emsidi chunaavon ke dauraan shungalu samiti kii report ke saamne aa jane ke baad se aam aadmi party ko kai sawaalon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he

 There was a rally of Narendra Modi in Mumbai on 17 March, which is reported to be postponed
 modi kii raily tali to bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke saath unka shakti pareekshan bhi tal gaya
 Nitish Adhikari is going to rally on this day in Delhi
 donon reliyon ko lekar media main khub atakalein chal rahi thim
 So did Modi decide not to hold a rally in Mumbai to postpone the power test? According to the party, keeping in view the drought situation in Maharashtra, Modi has postponed the rally but political speculation is here to avoid a confrontation with Nitish
 The rally is postponed
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne istipha de diya he
 Nitish Kumar resigned from the post of CM after his party jdu's very poor performance in the Lok Sabha elections 
 bihar sarkaar ke mukhya sachiv ne nitish kumaar ke istife kii khabar kii pushti kii he
 Nitish also appointed Governor Dr
 di vaai patil ko istipha saunp diya he
 There is also news that Nitish Kumar has recommended the Governor to dissolve the assembly
 gauratlab he ki shuukravaar ko loksabhaa chunaav ke jo nattejey aae the, isamen nitish kii party jediu kaa pradarshan behad hi kharaab rahaa
 JDU, which won 20 seats in 2009, could win only 2 seats
 badahaali kaa andaja is baat se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki party adhyaksh sharad yadav bhi madhepura seat se chunaav haar gaye
 Since then, political opponents were targeting Nitish Kumar
 bihar bijepi ke varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi ne to yahaan tak daawa kar diya ki unke sampark main jediu ke kareeb 50 vidhayak hai
 He can join BJP
 duusari taraf, haal hi main endie main shaamil hone vaale algepi pramukh ramvilas paswan ne apni party ke shandaar pradarshan ke baad shanivaar ko hi press conference karke apane samarthakon ko chetaya tha ki bihar main sarkaar kabhi bhi gir sakati he
 Elections may be held by October
 isliye endie kaaryakartaaon ko vidhansabha chunaav ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 Political opponents have termed Nitish Kumar's resignation as a political hypocrisy
 unhone sawaal uthaaya he ki nitish ne karaari haar ke baad sahanubhuti paane ke liye aisa kiya he
 But they are not going to get any benefit
 bijepi netaa rameshwar chaurasia ne kaha, 'nitish kumaar hameshaa dusron ke sahare rahe hai
 They do not have the courage to stand alone
 pehle lalu ke sahare mantri bane
 Then we became the Chief Minister of Bihar
 aaj jab bihar main narendra modi kii lokapriyata badi he to unhen apni jameen khisakati najar aa rahi he
 Had started dreaming of becoming the PM himself, now that he knew about the ground reality and resigned and got rid of the body
 'nitish kumaar ke istife par chutki lete hue bijepi netaa giriraaj singh ne twit kiya he
 The engaged hands also form the BJP government in Bihar # nitishresigns — Giriraj Singh (@girirajsinghbjp) May 17, 2014 One reason for Nitish Kumar's resignation is that the JDU does not have an absolute majority in the Bihar Assembly
 vartmaan vidhansabha main jediu ke 116 vidhayak he
 Although technically, the party has only 112 mlas
 bijepi se alag hone ke baad jediu ke paas 117 vidhayak the
 Since then, Nitish Kumar has expelled 5 mlas from the party
 is tarah jediu ke paas ab keval 112 vidhayak hai
 It seems that the fear of the historic victory of the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi has now started harassing the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as well
 aresas ne bijepi ko hidaayat di he ki wo aam aadmi party ko halke main naa le
 Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat has asked the BJP not to be too happy with the results of the assembly elections
 use aam aadmi party ko gambhirtha se lenaa hoga varanaa aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey man mutabik nahin bhi ho sakate hai
 In fact, a three-day executive meeting of the RSS and its affiliates took place in Hyderabad

 It is reported from the sources that in the meeting, the RSS has asked the BJP leadership to emphasize on these three important issues

 This is the time of year when you make financial plans
 inase aapkaa aarthik bhavishya prabhavit ho saktaa he
 Here are some tips that can help you strengthen your financial position in the long run
 tex kii yojana banaaendesh main kamaane vaale har shaks ko tex dena padataa he
 So start investing according to the 80C rule in the beginning
 aakhri vakt main apane vittiya salaahkaar kaa munh taakane kii bajaae isaki prakriya jald shuru kar den or tex kaa boj kam karne ke liye nivesh karne vaali rakam kii puri yojana bana len
 Start with the tools like PPF, which get interest on investment, as soon as possible
 jab yah lesaus jaise equity se jude product hon yaa tex bachaane vaale saajha fund hon to saal ke shuru main hi isaki shuruyaat kar dene kaa matlab he esaypi ke jariye zyada unit jamaa kar lenaa
 Choose the right insurance: Do not consider insurance (life, health etc
) as an investment, but take it as a means of protecting against any unintended danger
 is aam manyata se baahar nikalen ki beemaa lene se sirf tex bachaane main phayda miltaa he
 Take insurance as a life-threatening protection
 agar aapane koi beemaa yojana le rakhi he to dekhen ki beemaa se milane vaali rakam maujuuda jivan str ke hisaab se kya aapke parivaar ko suraksha dene ke liye paryaapt he
 If not, get another insurance plan
 agar aap sirf offis se milane vaali swasthya beemaa yojana par ashrith hai to aapako us policy kii puri baarikiyaan va upyogita samajhane kii darkaar he
 Make sure that the family dependent on you is getting the benefit of this health insurance plan or not
 agar aisa nahin he to koi nai swasthya yojana le len
 Take it as soon as these plans have a waiting period for existing or certain diseases

 ipel kochi team kii frenchiji randevu ke siio shailendra gaekwad ne kaha he ki modi ne ipel se kochi team kaa daawa waapas lene ke liye paisa dene kii peshkash kii thi
 He had also complained to the BCCI
 gaekwad ke mutabik modi kabhi nahin chaahate the ki wo log kochi ipel ke liye daawa karen
 Gaikwad also revealed that Shashi Tharoor has nothing to do with the Kochi team
 unhone kaha ki kochi team main sunanda pushkar kii hissedari sirf paanch fisadi he
 Responding to questions raised by the ipl's Kochi franchise about its ownership by Lalit Modi, its Chief Executive Officer Shailendra Gaikwad said that his new team was being deliberately put into difficulty as he had seen big houses in the auction
 Leaving the franchise behind
 gaekwad ne kaha unki frenchiji ko jaanboojh kar nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he kyonki hamane kai bade bade vyavsaayik sansthaanon ko ipel frenchiji kii boli main pachhad diya, jinamein wo bhi shaamil hai jinhen modi ipel main laana chaahate the
 Angry Gaekwad said, 'we are being put into action unnecessarily
 agar hamaare dastavej thik nahin the to ham ipel kii boli kaise jeet sakate the
 We are being put in such difficulties, which is unfair
 ' unhone kaha ki daavedaari ke dastavejon main saaf-saaf iske maalikon ke bare main bataaya gaya he varanaa to yah naamanzoor ho jaati
 Gaikwad said that while making the claim, we had given all the information in the given documents, including PAN card, passport and other professional information
 jo bhi jaankaree jaruri thi, vah di gayi thi
 Suddenly doubts are being expressed about how the owners of this franchise
 gaekwad ne kaha ki ho saktaa he ki ipel ayukta modi isaliye kochi frenchiji kii raah main aadchan daalana chaah rahe hon taaki ve apane pasand kii team ko aage laa saken
 Gaikwad alleged that Modi had asked very personal questions in a meeting with the owners in Bangalore
 unhone kaha 'hamaari frenchiji ke maalikon ke bare main hamase kaaphi nijee sawaal puche gayi the, jinke jabaav dene ke liye ham maansik rup se taiyaar bhi nahin the
 As he asked, when did you meet Sunanda Pushkar etc
 questions which did not mean anything
 'gaekwad ne kaha, 'hamane baithak main kaha ki jin sawaalon ke jawaab abhi hamaare paas nahin he unhen ham jald se jald email ke jariye bhijwa denge
 We think most of the questions were well-planned
 isse pehle kii ham jawaab dete ve (modi) twitor par chale gayi or press kronfres main kaha ki hamen (gaekwad) is frenchiji ke maalikon ke bare main kuch maaloom nahin
 Modi said in a press conference in Mumbai on Wednesday that as far as the Kochi IPL team is concerned, it has been questioned so far
 yahaan tak kii jin logon ne frenchiji ke liye dastavej prastut kiye hai, ve bhi nahin jaanate maalik koun koun he

 rld's vote percentage of 3 in 2007 elections
 70% tha
 Learning from the crushing defeat in the 2007 elections, the RLD fielded candidates for only 46 seats in the 2012 elections
 is baar bhi parinaam areldi ke ashaanthup nahin rahaa or use sirf 9 siton se santosh karnaa padaa
 20 of his candidates were forfeited in the elections
 2012 ke chunaavon main areldi kaa vot pratishat ghatakar 2
 Only 33% remained
 2017 ke chunaavon ke maddenjar bhi areldi kii koi badi taiyaari najar nahin aati
 RLD is looking forward to the alliance
 agar sapa ke saath uskaa gathbandhan na hua to vah apane nimnatam str kii ore ja sakati he
 If the RLD also comes in the alliance of the seat, the Congress seats may be reduced
 sapa ne saaf kar rakhaa he ki ve 300 siten to apane paas hi rakhenge
 The remaining seats can be left for the alliance
 jaahir he ki agar gathbandhan kii jagah agar yah mahagathbandhan hua to congress ko 70 ke aasapaas siton par santosh karnaa padegaa
 However, the Congress is taking this alliance like Sanjeevani so that it can come to a satisfactory position and avoid the consequences of defeat
 sapa ko he dhruvikaran kaa darpashchimi upi main sapa gathbandhan ke saath maidan main isliye utarana chaah rahi he kyonki agast 2013 main hue mujffarnagar dange ke baad rajya kaa yah kshetra do virgon main banta hua najar aata he
 During the Lok Sabha elections in this part of the state, the effect of polarization was clearly visible
 hindu bahulya ilaaka hone ke chalate bijepi ko thodi raahat kii ummid he, yahi vajah he ki sapa muslim vot par majboot pakad banane kii harsambhav koshish main lagi hui he
 In the SP-BSP, a tough competition was seen in 2012 in West Uttar Pradesh, SP got 24 seats, BSP 23, BJP 13, RLD 9 and Congress 5 seats
 mathura kii maant seat upachunaav ke dauraan bijepi ke khate main aa gai thi
 At the same time, RLD mlas from Govardhan seat of Mathura have now joined BJP
 isi tarah se aligarh kii barauli vidhansabha se areldi vidhayak bhi ab bijepi main shaamil ho chuke hai

 The Melbourne Test is the last chance for Team India players to return to the Test series, and this will be well-known to Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, but after losing 0-2 in the series to Team India in Melbourne The way back will not be easy
 kam se kam, aankadon ke hisaab se to yah behad mushkil chunauti lag rahi he
 a total of 11 Test matches have been played between Team India and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, of which eight have been won by Australia, while India have managed to win only two Tests here
 donon tiimon ke bich ek test match drow rahaa he
 Not only this, India has not been able to win any Test match on this ground in the last 33-34 years, and during this time the Indian cricket team played five Test matches here and suffered defeat in five
 bharat ne aakhri baar varsh 1980-81 main kapil dev kii shandaar gendbaazi kii badaulat australia ko 59 ran se haraaya tha, or usase pehle varsh 1977-78 main sunil gavaskar ke shatak or bhagwat chandrashekhar kii shandaar gendbaazi ke boote team ne is maidan main pehali jeet hasil kii thi
 But the performance of Team India in Melbourne in the last several years has not been very good
 team ke maujuuda str ko dekhte hue melbern main team india kii jeet kii ummid bhi nahin he, lekin australian diggaj cricketer riki ponting ke mutabik bhartiya team yahaan jeet kii ummid kar sakati he
 He said, the Test match that Team India can win in this series is the Melbourne Test itself, because here on a slow and flat wicket, Team India can perform better
 melbern kii pich se spinneron ko madad milane kii ummid jarur kii ja rahi he, lekin ahm sawaal yahi he ki kya team india ke khilaadi is wicket kaa phayda uthaa paaenge
 
 
 The Will the middle order batsmen be able to show the courage to stay on the wicket in difficult moments
 
 
 ? kya melbern main team india jeet kii pataakaa fahraa paaegi
 
 
 The To get the answer to all these questions yes, the players of the team will have to perform a charismatic performance, and without that history cannot be expected to change
