 com / m0owahchdq — Karan Johar (@karanjohar) December 14, 2019 Talking about the film, this was his second film as a director
 film main shahrukh khan or amitabh bachchan ke alaava kaajol, ruthik roshan, karina kapur or jaya bachchan thim
 The songs and dialogues of the film were huge hits
 kaajol-shahrukh kii superhit jodi kii rakhi buniyadakaran johar kii baat karen to unhone is film se pehle shahrukh khan ke saath saal 1998 main kuch kuch hota he banaai thi
 This film was also well liked by the audience
 film main kaajol or shahrukh khan kii jodi ko apni duusari film kabhi khushi kabhi gam main bhi doharaaya
 The pair were also well-liked in both films
 har bachche ke liye apni maa kaa janmdin khaas hota he
 This is the day when you give a lot of love to your mother and try different formulas to make her day better
 jaise ham sabhi apni maa se pyaar karte hai, usee tarah bollywood actress aalia bhatta bhi apni maa soni razdan se behad pyaar karti hai
 Today is Soni Razdan's birthday and Alia Bhatt cannot share the post to praise her mother and thank her
 aalia ne soshal media par apni maa soni razdan sang ek throbac photo post kii he
 This photo is of Alia's childhood, in which she is sitting on the lap of mother Soni and is looking at the camera
 vahiin unki maa soni unhen dekhakar hans rahi hai
 Sharing this photo, Alia wrote, 'best wishes to the most inspiring, sensible, beautiful, special person
 main aapse bahut pyaar karti hum maa
 Thank you for being yourself and thank you for bringing me into the world
 happy berthde maa
 'till Thursday, Alia Bhatt was in London with her sister Shaheen and boyfriend Baran Kapursang in London
 ranbir sang aalia kii kai photose soshal media par chai hui thim
 Both enjoyed their time in London and also took photos with the fans
 sand kii aankh: bhoomi pednekar-taapasi pannu kii acting kii tarif, yujar ne kaha- duniya kii best filmafilmi projects kii baat karen to aalia bhatta or ranbir kapur november main film brahmastra kii shooting ke liye manali ja rahe hai
 The film is being produced by director Ayan Mukherjee and the movie will be released in 2020
 iske alaava aalia, film sadak 2 main sanjay dutt, aditya roy kapur or puja bhatta ke saath kaam kar rahi hai
 The film is being produced by director Mahesh Bhatt
 ye aalia or mahesh bhatta kii saath main pehali film he
 Apart from Road 2, Alia will also be seen in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Gangbai Kathiawadi and Karan Johar's throne
 uttar pradesh sarkaar ke cabinet mantri ajam khan ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri or bijepi ke pradhanmantri ummidavaar narendra modi kaa naam liye bagaiyr unpar jabardast waar kiya
 He said that we should not be given the reins of the country in the hands of those who consider us puppies
 ajam khan ne is dauraan rahul gandhi or congress ko bhi aade haathon liya
 Without naming Narendra Modi, Azam Khan attacked him fiercely, saying, 'I would like to tell you that those who have blood stains on their foreheads, who are responsible for human slaughtering
 agar wo log desh chalaane ke liye aapse kahen to aise logon ke hawaale desh mat karnaa
 Don't hand over the country to those who call us puppies
 hamaari topi phenk dene waalon ke hawaale desh mat karnaa
 Because the safa that will be on your head will be our respect
 hamaari topi kaa sammaan agar tumhaare safe ke saath hoga to na topi mahfuj rahegi na safa
 He also took a dig at Rahul Gandhi's statement in which Rahul said that the SP government is not deliberately implementing the Food Security Bill in the state
 ajam khan ne kaha, 'bauchhaar he hamaare upar samaaj ke pattharon kii
 We are accused of rioting
 aapako kya ham aise lagate he ki ham bahut chote karmchaaree kii sifarish karegein, yaa usko nuksaan pahunchaana chahenge? agar hamaare jaise logon ko bhi jo taadaad main bahut zyada nahin he
 If you go to them too, then someone who speaks about your heart will not come here for a long time
 'ajam khan ne aage kaha, 'maahaul bigaadane kii jin logon ne koshish kii he upi main
 In the name of Hindus and Muslims, he tried to blood the society and to a great extent
 usamen abhi tak aapke samaaj kaa naam nahin he
 i want this message to go a long way
 koi kam koshish nahin hui he aapako ladaane kii or bhadakaane kii
 There has been no attempt to use it
 lekin daulatmand or shadyantrakaari aapako uksaane main kaamyaab nahin ho sakaa
 Targeting Rahul Gandhi, Azam Khan said, "rahul said yesterday that the UP government is not implementing the food security bill
" ek aisa vyakti jiske bare main ye kaha ja rahaa he ki wo kal kaa pradhanmantri hoga
 They are not aware of such a law system
 is par mere jaise vyakti ko shame aati he
 You got this bill passed in Parliament
 rajyasabha se paas hua loksabhaa se paas hua
 It has a long procedure, will go to state governments with notifications
 rajya sarkaar aadesh paarit karegi, jile tak jayega
 You have not only abused the UP government by abusing the UP government, but have also raised the question mark towards your understanding that the Prime Minister of the country, as the Congress thinks, is less than knowledgeable, understandable
 'congress ke chunaav abhiyaan ke bare main ajam khan bole, 'aap aligarh or rampur gayi jinhen muslim basti kaha jaataa he
 You have chosen such areas from where this message goes that we have started our election campaign from stupid Muslims here
 kyonki 55 saal se inhen ridh kii haddi bataakar hamane raaj kiya he
 ' ashutosh ji, i was not in Delhi today
 devendra sharma ke saath recording kar rahaa tha ki kisaanon kii is samasya kaa kya koi samaadhaan ho saktaa he
 We were talking with a dispirited farmer in a withering field of wheat
 hamane kisaan rampal singh se poocha ki aapke khet main chalenge to jo bachaa he wo bhi samaapt ho jayega
 Desperate Rampal Singh said beforehand that there is nothing
 isamen kuch bachaa nahin he
 i would be happy if other farmers benefit from your walk
 vaise bhi ab iskaa koi daam to milanaa nahin he, kuch kaam hi aa jaae
 This is the say of the farmer who wants that at least the right thing should be talked about on the pretext of his ruin
 shaayad gajendra ne bhi isi iraade se jaan de di jis iraade se rampal singh ne hamaare liye apana khet de diya
 We came to Karnal from Delhi because the solution was not being discussed
 congress bijepi kii tamaam bahason se sabakaa bahikhaata to khul rahaa tha magar baat aage nahin bad rahi thi
 i had also seen the report of colleague Sharad Sharma that Delhi government has announced compensation of Rs 20,000 per acre but no farmer has got compensation
 aapke hi vidhayak devendra saharaavat dilli or uske aas-paas kisaanon kii is samasya ko lekar harakat main aane vaale pehle netaaon main se the
 If i remember correctly, Devendra Sehrawat had sent many smses to the media that the situation is very bad
 tab se lekar aaj tak dilli main kitne kisaanon ko muawza diya gaya he isaki koi saarvajanik jaankaree nahin he
 Sharad Sharma's report done two days before the jantar-mantar rally shows that no surveyee has gone there
 kisaan kab tak intazaar karte lihaaza gehun kaatane lage hai
 Perhaps the Delhi government is talking about giving money directly to the farmers through chaupals without survey
 aisi koi chaoupal hui he yaa nahin magar mohalla sabha kii vistrut report akhbaaron main padhi he
 In Chaupal, the matter of asking the people for compensation by asking the people between the MLA and the head is really unique
 agar aisa he to dilli sarkaar ko ab tak muawza baant dena chahie tha kyonki use baaki sarkaron kii tarah survey karne or tehseeldaar se collector tak report bhejne kii lambii prakriya se nahin guzaranaa he
 In the surveyed states where the complete survey may not have been done, the report has been given to the central government
 yah bhi ek kism kaa farzivada he jo chal rahaa he
 Anyway, can you tell whether the Delhi Government has sent any report to the Central Government or not
 dilli sarkaar ne raily ke pehle tak kitne kisaanon ko bees hazaar prati acre kii raashi se paise baant die hai
 It is also important to state this so that it can become a Nazir for the rest of the states
 agar dilli sarkaar nuksaan ke vakt laagat main munaafaa jodakar muawza dene kaa elaan kar sakati he to kya usase yah ummid kii jaae ki vah nunemat samarthan mulya bhi baaki rajyon se zyada degi
 If no law of the central government comes in the way
 kheti sankat par bani tamaam cametiyon ne suzav diye hai ki nunatam samarthan mulya kii jagah laagat par munafa jodakar tay mulya par kisaanon se utpaada kharida jaae
 Delhi will not have the same number of farmers as Haryana or Uttar Pradesh, so can it be expected that this can happen in this small state
 itnaa sab likhane kaa meraa yahi makasad he ki isi bahaane kisaanon kaa kuch bhala ho jaae
 There should be some concrete policy along with compensation
 isiilie aapane dekha hoga ki maine is lekh kii shuruuaat aapse se to kii magar aapke us bayaan se nahin ki jo aapane jantar mantar kii ghatana ke baad diya he
 Well done, which you apologized, but can you also tell what mood you were going through while making an apology statement? gajendra kii aatmahatya se to aap bhi kaaphi dukhi honge phir dukh ke samay aise tevar vaale bayaan kaise nikal gaye
 Did you get angry that your leader is being surrounded by suicide
 patrkaar kyon puch rahe hai ki aatmahatya ke baad raily kyon chalati rahi
 People are also asking the media on Twitter why the cameras did not see or try to save
 kyon gussa aayaa
 Why did you say that if something happens next time, the Chief Minister of Delhi will climb the tree and save the person
 aap bhul gaye ki aapke hi mukhyamantri bijli ke khambhe par chadhakar taar kaatane kii baat karte the
 You forgot that even after being the chief minister, journalists can ask uncomfortable questions from opponents
 sawaal galat bhi ho sakate hai
 Can also be correct
 lekin is bayaan main atirikt nishtha jataane ke alaava yah pravriti bhi nazar aa rahi he ki mukhyamantri kaa naam is vivaad main kaise le liya gaya
 i think that if the governments move towards a solution, then no one will get angry but a sense of service will arise within it
 tippaniyan Certainly politics is taking place on this incident like political rallies are taking place regarding the condition of farmers
 main nahin kah rahaa ki gajendra kii maut ke liye aap zimmedaar hai yaa aapmen se koi manch chhodkar bachaa saktaa tha
 Whoever Gajendra came to your rally, that's why he is your guest as well as hitchhiker
 kya pataa usne is raily main raajnneeti ke us viraat satya ko dekh liya ho jiske bare main wo khat likhakar laayaa tha
 No one could climb a tree for Gajendra, that's why he climbed himself
 ek sahyatri kii maut kaa dukh tevar vaale bayanon se zaahir nahin karte
 Even if the leaders of BJP or Congress have given political statements or those statements have the same cruelty as seen in your statement, but Gajendra's death is shameful for all governments and societies
 yah samuhik shame or chintaa kaa samay he
 It is time to leave the jantar-mantar and Ramlila plains and go to the fields with relief material, just as people go during other disasters
 main aaj dilli main nahin tha
 Devendra was recording with Sharma whether there could be any solution to this problem of farmers
 ham gehun ke murajhaae khet main ek maayoos kisaan ke saath baat kar rahe the
 We asked farmer Rampal Singh that if he walks in your field, what is left will also be finished
 pehle se maayoos rampal singh ne kaha ki koi baat nahin
 There is nothing left in it
 agar aapke chalane se duusare kisaanon ko phayda ho jaataa he to mujhe khushi hogi
 Anyway, now there is no cost to it, some work will come
 ye us kisaan kaa kahana he jo chahta he ki uski barbaadi ke hi bahaane sahi kam se kam samaadhaan par baat to ho
 Perhaps Gajendra gave his life with the same intention with which Rampal Singh gave his field for us
 ham isliye dilli se karnal aa gaye the ki samaadhaan par baat nahin ho rahi thi
 The Congress was open to all the debates of the BJP, but the matter was not moving forward
 maine sahyogi sharad sharma kii wo bhi report bhi dekhi thi ki dilli sarkaar ne bees hazaar rupee prati acre muawza dene kaa elaan kiya he lekin kisi kisaan ko muawza nahin mila he
 Your own MLA Devendra Sehrawat was one of the first leaders to act on this problem of farmers in and around Delhi
 agar mujhe thik-thik yaad he to devendra saharaavat ne media ko kai esemes kiya tha ki sthiti bahut karaab he
 Since then till date there is no public information about how many farmers have been compensated in Delhi
 jantar-mantar kii raily se do din pehle kii gai sharad sharma kii report bataati he ki vahaan koi survey karne vaala nahin gaya he
 The farmers have started cutting wheat so long as they waited
 shaayad dilli sarkaar bina survey ke hi chaoupaalon ke zariye kisaanon ko sidhe paisa dene kii baat kar rahi he
 Whether or not there has been such a chaupal, but have read the detailed report of the Mohalla Sabha in the newspapers
 chaoupal main vidhayak or pradhan ke bich logon se poochkar muawza dene kii baat vaaki nayab he
 If this is the case then the Delhi government should have distributed the compensation by now as it does not have to go through the long process of surveying and sending reports from Tehsildar to Collector like other governments
 vaise survey vaale rajyon main jahaan puraa survey bhale na hua ho centre sarkaar ko report de di gai he
 This is also a kind of fraud that is going on
 kair to kya aap bataa sakate hai ki centre sarkaar ko dilli sarkaar ne koi report bheji he yaa nahin
 The Delhi government has distributed money from the amount of twenty thousand per acre to how many farmers till the rally
 yah bataanaa isliye bhi zaruri he taaki yah baaki rajyon ke liye bhi nazir ban sake
 If the Delhi government can declare compensation by adding profits to the cost at the time of loss, should it be expected that it will pay the minimum support price more than the rest of the states
 agar centre sarkaar kaa koi kanoon aade nahin aata ho to
 All the committees on the farming crisis have suggested that the products should be purchased from the farmers at fixed prices by adding profits on the cost instead of the minimum support price
 dilli main haryana yaa uttar pradesh kii tarah kisaanon kii sankhya bhi utani nahin hogi isliye kya yah ummid kii ja sakati he is chote se rajya main aisa ho saktaa he
 My purpose in writing so much is that the farmers get some good on this excuse
 muaavze ke saath-saath kuch thos niti ban jaae
 That is why you must have seen that i started this article with you but not from your statement that you have given after Jantar Mantar incident
 acha kiya jo aapane maafee maang lee par kya aap yah bhi bataa sakate hai ki maafee maangane laayak bayaan dete vakt aap kis manodasha se guzar rahe the
 You will also be saddened by Gajendra's suicide, then how did such statements come out in times of grief
 kya aapako gussa aa gaya ki aatmahatya ko lekar aapke netaa ko gheraa ja rahaa he
 Journalists are asking why the rally continued after the suicide
 log to twitor par media se bhi puch rahe hai ki camere waalon ne kyon nahin dekha yaa bachaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Why angry kyon aapane kaha ki agar agali baar kuch aisa hoga to dilli ke mukhyamantri ped par chadh jaaenge or vyakti ko bachaa lenge
 You forgot that your chief minister used to talk about cutting wires by climbing on electric poles
 aap bhul gaye ki mukhyamantri hone ke baad bhi virdohi se lekar patrkaar asahaj sawaal puch sakate hai
 Questions can also be wrong
 sahi bhi ho sakate hai
 But in addition to expressing extra allegiance in this statement, this trend is also visible how the name of the Chief Minister was taken in this controversy
 mujhe lagata he ki agar sarkarein samaadhaan kii taraf badhengi to kisi ko gussa nahin aayega balki uske bheetar seva bhav jaagega
 The comments nishchit rup se is ghatana par raajnneeti ho rahi he jaise kisaanon kii dasha ko lekar raajnneetik reliyaan ho rahi hai
 i am not saying that you are responsible for the death of Gajendra or that any of you could have saved it by leaving the stage
 jo bhi he gajendra aapaki raily main aayaa tha isliye wo aapkaa mehmaan hone ke saath-saath sahyatri bhi he
 Did you know that in this rally, you have seen the great truth of politics about which he had written a letter
 gajendra ke liye koi ped par nahin chadh saktaa tha isiilie wo khud ped par chadh gaya
 The grief of the death of a hitchhiker does not reflect the statements made with frowns
 bhale hi bijepi yaa congress ke netaaon ne raajnneetik bayaan diye hon yaa un bayanon main bhi waisi krurta ho jaisi aapke is bayaan main nazar ai lekin gajendra kii maut sabhi sarkaron or samaajon ke liye sharmnaak he
 This is a time of collective shame and worry
 jantar-mantar or ramlila maidaanon ko chhod vaise hi raahat saamagree lekar kheton main jane kaa samay he jaise baaki aapadaaon ke vakt log jate hai
 Desperate Rampal Singh said beforehand that there is nothing
 isamen kuch bachaa nahin he
 i would be happy if other farmers benefit from your walk
 vaise bhi ab iskaa koi daam to milanaa nahin he, kuch kaam hi aa jaae
 This is the say of the farmer who wants that at least the right thing should be talked about on the pretext of his ruin
 shaayad gajendra ne bhi isi iraade se jaan de di jis iraade se rampal singh ne hamaare liye apana khet de diya

 Why angry kyon aapane kaha ki agar agali baar kuch aisa hoga to dilli ke mukhyamantri ped par chadh jaaenge or vyakti ko bachaa lenge
 You forgot that your chief minister used to talk about cutting wires by climbing on electric poles
 aap bhul gaye ki mukhyamantri hone ke baad bhi virdohi se lekar patrkaar asahaj sawaal puch sakate hai
 Questions can also be wrong
 sahi bhi ho sakate hai
 But in addition to expressing extra allegiance in this statement, this trend is also visible how the name of the Chief Minister was taken in this controversy
 mujhe lagata he ki agar sarkarein samaadhaan kii taraf badhengi to kisi ko gussa nahin aayega balki uske bheetar seva bhav jaagega
 The comments nishchit rup se is ghatana par raajnneeti ho rahi he jaise kisaanon kii dasha ko lekar raajnneetik reliyaan ho rahi hai
 i am not saying that you are responsible for the death of Gajendra or that any of you could have saved it by leaving the stage
 jo bhi he gajendra aapaki raily main aayaa tha isliye wo aapkaa mehmaan hone ke saath-saath sahyatri bhi he
 Did you know that in this rally, you have seen the great truth of politics about which he had written a letter
 gajendra ke liye koi ped par nahin chadh saktaa tha isiilie wo khud ped par chadh gaya
 The grief of the death of a hitchhiker does not reflect the statements made with frowns
 bhale hi bijepi yaa congress ke netaaon ne raajnneetik bayaan diye hon yaa un bayanon main bhi waisi krurta ho jaisi aapke is bayaan main nazar ai lekin gajendra kii maut sabhi sarkaron or samaajon ke liye sharmnaak he
 This is a time of collective shame and worry
 jantar-mantar or ramlila maidaanon ko chhod vaise hi raahat saamagree lekar kheton main jane kaa samay he jaise baaki aapadaaon ke vakt log jate hai
 Perhaps the Delhi government is talking about giving money directly to the farmers through chaupals without survey
 aisi koi chaoupal hui he yaa nahin magar mohalla sabha kii vistrut report akhbaaron main padhi he
 In Chaupal, the matter of asking the people for compensation by asking the people between the MLA and the head is really unique
 agar aisa he to dilli sarkaar ko ab tak muawza baant dena chahie tha kyonki use baaki sarkaron kii tarah survey karne or tehseeldaar se collector tak report bhejne kii lambii prakriya se nahin guzaranaa he
 In the surveyed states where the complete survey may not have been done, the report has been given to the central government
 yah bhi ek kism kaa farzivada he jo chal rahaa he
 Anyway, can you tell whether the Delhi Government has sent any report to the Central Government or not
 dilli sarkaar ne raily ke pehle tak kitne kisaanon ko bees hazaar prati acre kii raashi se paise baant die hai
 It is also important to state this so that it can become a Nazir for the rest of the states
 agar dilli sarkaar nuksaan ke vakt laagat main munaafaa jodakar muawza dene kaa elaan kar sakati he to kya usase yah ummid kii jaae ki vah nunemat samarthan mulya bhi baaki rajyon se zyada degi
 If no law of the central government comes in the way
 kheti sankat par bani tamaam cametiyon ne suzav diye hai ki nunatam samarthan mulya kii jagah laagat par munafa jodakar tay mulya par kisaanon se utpaada kharida jaae
 Delhi will not have the same number of farmers as Haryana or Uttar Pradesh, so can it be expected that this can happen in this small state
 itnaa sab likhane kaa meraa yahi makasad he ki isi bahaane kisaanon kaa kuch bhala ho jaae
 There should be some concrete policy along with compensation
 isiilie aapane dekha hoga ki maine is lekh kii shuruuaat aapse se to kii magar aapke us bayaan se nahin ki jo aapane jantar mantar kii ghatana ke baad diya he
 Well done, which you apologized, but can you also tell what mood you were going through while making an apology statement? gajendra kii aatmahatya se to aap bhi kaaphi dukhi honge phir dukh ke samay aise tevar vaale bayaan kaise nikal gaye
 Did you get angry that your leader is being surrounded by suicide
 patrkaar kyon puch rahe hai ki aatmahatya ke baad raily kyon chalati rahi
 People are also asking the media on Twitter why the cameras did not see or try to save
 kyon gussa aayaa
 Why did you say that if something happens next time, the Chief Minister of Delhi will climb the tree and save the person
 aap bhul gaye ki aapke hi mukhyamantri bijli ke khambhe par chadhakar taar kaatane kii baat karte the
 You forgot that even after being the chief minister, journalists can ask uncomfortable questions from opponents
 sawaal galat bhi ho sakate hai
 Can also be correct
 lekin is bayaan main atirikt nishtha jataane ke alaava yah pravriti bhi nazar aa rahi he ki mukhyamantri kaa naam is vivaad main kaise le liya gaya
 i think that if the governments move towards a solution, then no one will get angry but a sense of service will arise within it
 tippaniyan Certainly politics is taking place on this incident like political rallies are taking place regarding the condition of farmers
 main nahin kah rahaa ki gajendra kii maut ke liye aap zimmedaar hai yaa aapmen se koi manch chhodkar bachaa saktaa tha
 Whoever Gajendra came to your rally, that's why he is your guest as well as hitchhiker
 kya pataa usne is raily main raajnneeti ke us viraat satya ko dekh liya ho jiske bare main wo khat likhakar laayaa tha
 No one could climb a tree for Gajendra, that's why he climbed himself
 ek sahyatri kii maut kaa dukh tevar vaale bayanon se zaahir nahin karte
 Even if the leaders of BJP or Congress have given political statements or those statements have the same cruelty as seen in your statement, but Gajendra's death is shameful for all governments and societies
 yah samuhik shame or chintaa kaa samay he
 It is time to leave the jantar-mantar and Ramlila plains and go to the fields with relief material, just as people go during other disasters
 kair to kya aap bataa sakate hai ki centre sarkaar ko dilli sarkaar ne koi report bheji he yaa nahin
 The Delhi government has distributed money from the amount of twenty thousand per acre to how many farmers till the rally
 yah bataanaa isliye bhi zaruri he taaki yah baaki rajyon ke liye bhi nazir ban sake
 If the Delhi government can declare compensation by adding profits to the cost at the time of loss, should it be expected that it will pay the minimum support price more than the rest of the states
 agar centre sarkaar kaa koi kanoon aade nahin aata ho to
 All the committees on the farming crisis have suggested that the products should be purchased from the farmers at fixed prices by adding profits on the cost instead of the minimum support price
 dilli main haryana yaa uttar pradesh kii tarah kisaanon kii sankhya bhi utani nahin hogi isliye kya yah ummid kii ja sakati he is chote se rajya main aisa ho saktaa he
 My purpose in writing so much is that the farmers get some good on this excuse
 muaavze ke saath-saath kuch thos niti ban jaae
 That is why you must have seen that i started this article with you but not from your statement that you have given after Jantar Mantar incident
 acha kiya jo aapane maafee maang lee par kya aap yah bhi bataa sakate hai ki maafee maangane laayak bayaan dete vakt aap kis manodasha se guzar rahe the
 You will also be saddened by Gajendra's suicide, then how did such statements come out in times of grief
 kya aapako gussa aa gaya ki aatmahatya ko lekar aapke netaa ko gheraa ja rahaa he
 Journalists are asking why the rally continued after the suicide

 mujhe lagata he ki agar sarkarein samaadhaan kii taraf badhengi to kisi ko gussa nahin aayega balki uske bheetar seva bhav jaagega

 After that the exercise to remove them from the bungalow started but still nothing happened
 baad main atirikt bhugtan kii shart par unhen bangale main rahane diya gaya
 There is also an interesting case of former Home Minister Buta Singh who refused to vacate the bungalow of Teen Murti Marg on the basis of security, not only that he also requested to reduce his market rate rent which is Rs one lakh per month

 com / kirpvh7xfx govake siem manoharparrikarkaphi dinon se biimaar hai or unka ilaaj jari he
 But no one knows which disease they are suffering from because nothing was officially being told about it
 govasarkaar kii taraf se sirf itane hi statement aa rahe the ki parrikar kii haalat ab sudhar rahi he or ve jald-se-jald apane offis main aana shuru kar denge
 For the first time on Saturday, Goa Minister Vishwajit Rane said that Manohar Parrikar has pancreatic cancer
 ye baat chuphi hui nahin he
 He should be allowed to live peacefully with his family
 unhen iskaa puraa haq he
 After serving the people of Goa, if they want to spend some time with their family, no one is interested in asking them
 parrikar kii sehat ko lekar sarkaar kii taraf se koi bhi bayaan jari nahin nahin kiya gaya tha
 It was only said by the government that Parrikar was ill and for his treatment, he first got treatment at Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai and then in the US
 iske baad ve dilli ke ames main treetment le rahe hai
 Let me tell you that Manohar Parrikar has been sick for a long time, due to which the administrative work of Goa is stalled to a great extent
 govacongresane kai baar nishaanaa sadhate hue poocha ki parrikar kii sehat ko lekar to sarkaar kii taraf se koi medical bulatin kyon nahin nikaala gaya?goa congress ne ye aarope bhi lagaaya tha ki parrikar kisi bhi prakaar ke cabinet faisle nahin le rahe hai to filein kaise clear ho rahi he
 Several Goa Congress leaders also tried to meet the CM
 bataaya jaataa he ki siem se milakar ve unki sehat ke bare main poochna chaahate the
 Significantly, Manohar Parrikar has recently returned to Goa after being discharged from AIIMS Hospital in Delhi
 ve goa ke dona-pola sthit nivas sthaan par goa medical college ke doctor kii nigaraanee main treetment le rahe hai
 Meanwhile, the same statement was again issued from the CMO that Parrikar is recovering and will return to his office soon
 30 oktober ko parrikar ne apane hi ghar par goa sarkaar kii cabinet meeting bulaai he
 Parrikar is also being questioned here because if Parrikar can take away his ministerial post due to the illness of two of his cabinet ministers, why are he not resigning despite not having gone to his office for months due to his own illness? At present, there is confusion in the BJP about who will take over as the Chief Minister in the state
 bataaya jaataa he ki party adhyaksh amit shah aise netritv kii talash main he jo parrikar kii tarah kaam bhi karen or donon ghatak paksh yani goa forward or maharashtravaadi gomantak ko lekar saath chale
 However, the difficulties for the BJP are not being named
 ek taraf maharashtravaadi gomantak paksh ke netaa sudin dhavlikar kahin-na-kahin chaahate hai ki ve hi mukhyamantri bane, vahiin duusari taraf goa forward party kii taraf se sidhe taur par kaha gaya he ki unhone parrikar ko saport kiya tha, na ki bhaajapa ko
 It is now the responsibility of BJP leaders that if Parrikar is running ill, he should maintain good governance in Goa and complete this 5 years of this government
 yah jaananaa dilachasp hoga ki 30 oktober ko hone vaali cabinet meeting main parrikar apane cabinet saathiyon se kya kehete hai? sutron ke mutabik, meeting main siem apane mantrimandal kaa vistaar kar sakate hai
 Currently, he holds important ministerial posts like Home Ministry, Finance Ministry, which he can hand over to Goa Forward or Sudin Dhavalikar

 This visit of Modi is very important not only according to military forces but also according to diplomacy
 isroyal ke pradhanmantri benjamin netanyahu airport par modi ke swaagat ke liye maujuud rahenge
 What does the history of both countries say? Since the 90s, military relations between India and Israel have been strengthening
 pichley ek dashak ke dauraan donon deshon ke bich main kareeb 670 arab rupye kaa kaarobaar hua he
 At present, India is importing military products worth about 67 billion to 100 billion rupees annually from Israel
 aapako bataa den ki ye aankade isliye bhi mahatvapurn ho jate hai, kyonki donon deshon ke bich kootnithik sambandhon kii shuruyaat janvari, 1992 main hui thi
 There has also been an intention to sell Israel arms to strengthen the relationship between the two countries
 isamen 1999 ke kargil yuddh ke dauraan istemaal kiye gaye lager gided bam or maanavrahit hawaii vaahan shaamil rahe hai
 Israel has consistently helped India at the request of India in difficult times
 bharat ko abhi kya miltaa he isroyal se?media reports kii maane, bharat abhi bhi isroyal se kaaphi had tak hathiyaar kharidta he
 Currently, Israel provides large quantities of Israel missiles, anti-missile systems, uavs, reconnaissance technology, electronic warfare systems, airplane technology and ammunition to India
 awox par china ko naa, bharat ko hambharat or isroyal kii badhati dosti se bharat se bair rakhane vaale kai deshon ko dikkat ho sakati he
 For example, Israel has given India important technologies like missiles, anti missile systems, uavs, electronic warfare systems
 vahiin isse ulat isroyal ne china ko awaks system bechney se inkaar kar diya, par usne bharat ko yah system diya
 Israel gave India 73 in May 2009 and March 2010
 7 arab rupye main rus nirmit ilushin dwitiya-76 se las falcon airborn varning and control system (awaks) bechaa tha
 The Indian Airforce has three operational awcs, besides two others expected to join the Air Force soon
 isroyal par is takanic ko china ko naa dene kaa america dabaav tha
 In September 2014, a few months after the Modi government came to power, India announced the purchase of the Israeli aerospace industry's Barak - an anti-missile defense system, one of the most important agreements
 is khariddaari ke liye bharat ko kareeb 965 karod rupye chukaane honge
 Let us tell you that earlier the UPA government backed out of this agreement
 2 arab dollar kaa raksha kararhaal hi main april main isroyal ne bharat ke saath do arab dollar kaa qaraar kiya he, jiske tahat vah bharat ko missile raksha pranali kii aapurti karegaa
 This missile system will destroy aircraft, missiles and drones within a radius of 70 km
 nausena ke liye bhi kararijaroyal airospes industries ne bharat ke saath 63 karod dollar mulya kaa ek bada sauda kiya he
 Under the deal, the Israeli company will provide long-range air and missile defense systems for the four ships of the Indian Navy

 It is reported that she is going to start her designing line soon
 khabaron kii maane to aathiya jald hi yangsters ke liye apni cloding line kii shuruyaat karne ja rahi hai
 25-year-old Athiya Shetty is in the discussions among industry fans about her fashion statement more than films
 athiya shetty kaa fishan style events se lekar outing main athiya bollywood kii fishan deeva banakar ubhari hai
 If sources are to be believed, Athiya is very excited to start a new innings as a designer
 fishan brands kii team ke saath mulaakaat karne ke baad athiya ne collection ko lekar apane creative input die hai
 Now the brand's team will soon respond to Athiya with its final plan

 However, as much as Athiya has become famous in the fashion world, her magic is not seen in Bollywood
 unki aane vaali filmon ke bare main bhi philhal koi pukhta jaankaree nahin he
 Recently, there were reports of him signing a remake of Karan Johar's film Ram Lakhan but there was no official announcement
 gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa siton par hue upachunaav ne chaunkaanewaale nattejey die hai
 Several consequences are being drawn of these results and similar explanations are also being given
 upi ke mukhyamantri adityanath kah rahe hai ki ati aatmavishvaas ke kaaran bhartiya janata party haar gai
 Former Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav says that this is a victory of choice, a victory of social justice
 sapa or sahyogi dalon kii jeet he
 But this review of victory is being presented only at convenience
 kahani isse kahin aage jaati dikh rahi he
 The by-election results have many implications
 sabase pehla myne to yah he ki bhaajapa haari he
 Yogis are losers
 modi haare hai
 Otherwise, why would a one-year-old government with a two-thirds majority and the candidates of the same party's government at the center lose elections in the seats they had won
 usase bhi bada kaaran yah he ki gorakhpur yogi kii seat he jo soobe ke mukhyamantri hai or phulpur keshav prasad maury kii seat he jo rajya ke upmukhyamantri hai
 The defeat in their seats is much bigger for the BJP than the defeat in any other seat
 samaajawaadee party auki bahujan samaaj party bhale hi is baat se khaasi raahat mahasoos kar rahe hon ki yah unke liye suunepan main thandi bayaar banakar aayaa hua janadesh he lekin sach to yah he ki logon ne sapa-basapa ko jitaane ke liye nahin, modi or yogi ko sabak sikhaane ke liye vot kiya he
 People needed an alternative to teach a lesson in which the ability of the BJP to compete with the wave was negligible
 sapa ko basapa ke samarthan ne vah gunjaaish paidaa kar di or logon ne bhaajapa ke daant khattey kar die
 Read this too
 
 
 INSIDE STORY: jaane- kya hua akhilesh or mayawati kii mulaakaat membhaspa baar-baar yah doharayegi ki iskaa yogi or modi kii parformens se koi vaasta nahin he
 But in reality this battle is about performance and difference
 sapanom ke sansar ko modi ne jis oonchai par le jaakar sthapit kar diya he, uske badale main kiye gaye kaamon kii list bahut bauni he
 Trouble and increased for farmers, youth
 notebandi or jiesti ne kaam dene vaale or kaam karne vaale, donon hi virgon kii qamar tod di he
 Yogis are unable to do anything other than commit murders
 na bijli kaa sawaal sulajhaa he, na bacchon kii mautein rukii hai
 The slogans of the pit-free road and all development have proved to be false
 modi sapanom or yogi bhay ke dam par satta chalaa rahe hai
 But both things do not hold the throne of power for a long time
 janadesh iskaa pramaan he
 In this mandate, the story of the party's discord has turned into evidence
 haar ke baad press se baat karte hue keshav maury ne kah bhi diya ki phulpur to bhaajapa ekbar hi jiti thi, gorakhpur to dashakon se bhaajapa kii thi, phir bhi ham haar gaye hai
 It was the voice of the tee that has been filled in him since the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections
 unke sanyojakatv main bhaajapa ne 2017 kaa vidhansabha chunaav ladaa
 His name was discussed repeatedly for the post of Chief Minister
 lekin chhika yogi lut le gaye
 From then till today, Yogi and Maurya are shaking the government of the state in their own way
 aisi baaten logon ke bich charchaa main raheen ki yogi chaahate hai keshav phulpur haar jaaen
 The party's defeat in Keshav Maurya's seat would have made Yogi more relative to Keshav
 udhar brahman banaam kshatriya kaa sangharsh gorakhpur main apane charam par pahunchataa ja rahaa tha
 To counterbalance this, the BJP made Mahendra Pandey the state president of the BJP and after several months of tug of war, nominated a Pandit from Gorakhpur seat without Yogi's advice
 isse yogi vichlit the
 As a result, neither the BJP workers in Phulpur appeared full of confidence nor did the Yogi's Hindu Yuva Vahini in Gorakhpur actively jump into campaigning
 bhale hi ye baaten hi hon, lekin maahaul banane bigaadane main aisi baton kii ahmiyat hoti he
 Yogi and BJP could not stop them
 ise bhi padhein
 
 
 The 23-year-old enmity is buried, witnessing a new friendship, the picture that the BJP has lost in Gorakhpur is the seat of the Yogi and the Yogis reach Gorakhpur almost every week
 to kya soobe kaa mukhyamantri or gorakhpur kaa mahant aitihaasik jeet ke baad sarakate janadesh ko dekh nahin sakaa
 Would not the Yogi have thought that the BJP wants to weaken his Kshatriyaism and domination by giving tickets to a Pandit against his will
 gorakhpur main yadi bhaajapa pratyaashee jeetta to yah vahaan agadon kii ladaai main ek santulan laane kaa kaam karata
 But this did not happen and that is why the bjp's defeat in Gorakhpur is bigger than the defeat of Yogi
 haar isliye bhi chintajanak he kyonki isamen logon ke asantosh se zyaada party ke kaaryakartaaon or samarthakon kaa asantosh nihit he
 Workers have been complaining of neglect continuously
 samarthak yogi kii shashan style se puri tarah naakhush hai
 In such a situation, the team that the BJP needed to work on the ground, weakened
 bhaajapa agar is chunauti ko darkinar karti he to iskaa asar agle saal ke chunaavon par bhi dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 For Modi, this defeat will be seen as both good and bad news
 acchhee isliye ki unke uttaradhikari banane kii mahatvakanksha rakhane vaala yogi apane hi garh main ghutanon ke bal baith gaya he
 In this way, Modi's growing stature has been reduced again by Modi
 yogi kaa sankat bhi yahi he ki gorakhpur se nikalakar na to gorakhpur puri tarah se unke niyantran main he or na hi lakhanu kii gaddi wo bhaleebhanti sambhaal paa rahe hai
 The Hindu Yuva Vahini is beginning to weaken within a year
 gorakhpur main upachunaav kii haar unki is kamazor sthiti kaa pramaan ban gai he
 This is good news for Modi
 ye bhi padhein
 
 
 Gorakhpur by-election: BJP lost in the politics of Brahmin vs Thakur! But this is bad news for Modi because the defeat of these by-elections has hit the BJP on the ground even before the victory of Tripura faded
 gujarat kii feeki jeet ke baad rajasthan, madhya pradesh or ab uttar pradesh, bihar ke upachunaavon main bhaajapa kii haar se modi ke jaadu kaa tilism kamazor padataa nazar aa rahaa he
 At least the general voter will see it this way
 karnataka main bhi upachunaav ke is sandesh ko isi tarah se matadaata padhegaa
 And this is not a good sign for Modi
 agar yah silsilaa aise hi badha to 2019 main apni hawa ko banaae rakh paanaa modi ke liye khaasaa mushkil hoga
 In fact, after these results, Modi will surely think that what new ways do he need to take on the public to cast his spell
 kyonki wo bhi ye dekh paa rahe honge ki jaadu ke puraane khel ab janata ko lubhaane vaale nahin hai
 The public will evaluate their performance for four years with respect to magic and see if the leader with really big things is able to do big things
 upachunaavon ke nattejey isi mulyankan kii bhaap main bhare nazar aate hai
 It is not that this result is a victory of the agreement between the SP-BSP
 haalanki 23 saal baad donon dalon kaa saath aana ek aitihaasik sudhaar he
 But victory in the by-election is an early sign
 or yah sanket in donon dalon ke saath kii sweekaarokti kam, bhaajapa se naaraazgi zyaada he
 Yes, the agreement has given people a choice
 lekin is vikalp ko aage le jane ke liye abhi donon dalon ko khaasi mehnat kerani he
 Between people as well as within parties
 ise bhi padhein
 
 2 rajya, 5 chunaav or keval bhabhua ne bachaai bhagava kii lajupachunaav ke nateezon ke baad ab bhaajapa or sangh ko sochna hoga ki uttar pradesh jaise bade rajya ko ek jati ke chashme se dekhne vaala netritv kabatak satta or lokapriyata ko saadhe rakh paaegaa
 At the time of Akhilesh, there was confusion among people as to who was running the government - Akhilesh, Shivpal, Mulayam or Azam Khan
 vahi bhram kii sthiti vartmaan bhaajapa sarkaar ne bhi bani hui he
 This confusion has spread from bureaucracy to people
 yogi ise todane ke liye bhay kaa sahaara lete hai lekin aisa karte hue wo bahut simit or sankeern nazar aate hai
 The BJP will have to find a solution
 saath hi sapa or basapa ko bhi sochna he ki jo ummid logon ne jagaai he uske liye wo balidanon ke liye taiyaar hote hai yaa phir apane-apane ahm or varchasv ko bachaane kii kavayadon main ek baar phir se ek fail formula banakar rah jate hai
 And the Congress will have to think that when it will be able to move the political sensibility beyond the dinner tables of the opposition in Delhi to the ground with other opposition parties
 wo bhi khud ko bachaae rakhte hue
 On the issue of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the retail sector, on Tuesday, the proceedings were adjourned till Wednesday due to the uproar by opposition parties as well as some members of the ruling in both houses of parliament
 isse pehle mangalvaar ko jaise hi loksabhaa or rajyasabha kii kaarywahi shuru hui, vipakshi dalon ke saath-saath satta paksh ke kuch sadsy kaaphi hangaamaa karne lage jiske baad donon sadanon kii kaarywahi dopaher 12 baje tak ke liye sthagit kar di gai

 (input- ieenes) The third round of Gujarat's election summer has started
 pehla round rajyasabha chunaav ke dauraan tha, jab bhaajapa ne congress kii naak main dam kar diya tha or congress diggaj ahamed patel ko jeetne ke liye naakon chane chabane pade the
 Then came the second round of announcement of election dates
 yah wo vakt tha jab 'vikaas pagalaa gaya he' campan se congress cheentee kii tarah hathi kii sundh main ghus gai
 At least this is how the trend of social media was
 us packlpesh thakor or hardik pateljaise khilaadi bhi bhaajapa kii taang khinchate najar aae
 Now the third round has started and the first punch has been defeated by the BJP
 iske saath hi waar kii dhar or tikhi hoti najar aa rahi he
 Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani has surprised everyone by mentioning the name of Ahmad Patel, referring to the arrest of the suspected IS agent
 aaropon kii baariki ko chhod den to iske saath hi dhruvikaran kii raajnneeti kaa game changing card khel diya gaya he
 The BJP has shot arrows in the dark, but the target is on Ahmed Patel, political advisor to Sonia Gandhi and long-time party troubleshooter

 Hurt there or on someone who is reliable of the Gandhi family
 lekin agar yah tir nishane paralag gaya to 2019 kii daud par prabhaav daalane kii kshamta rakhata he
 In 2007, Sonia's arrow was reversed, the 2002 riots changed the hulia of Gujarat's politics
 2007 ke chunaav main bhi sonia gandhi ke tarkash se niklaa 'maut kaa saudagar' vaala jumala congress ke liye ulataa padaa
 Every time the talk starts with the development in the election rallies but at the end of the elections, it stops on the Hindus and Muslims

 It also has the devastation and floods of the caste movement
 yahi vajah he ki ekbar phir rashtrawaad, aatankwaad or gujarati asmita kii yaad bhaajapa ko aa rahi he
 At the same time, after 22 years of political famine in Gujarat, the Congress, engaged in a comeback, is also imprisoned in this mindset
 yahi vajah he ki rahul gandhi ko prachaar ke dauraan bhagwaan kii yaad zyada aa rahi he
 However, strengthening the doors of Gujarat is crucial for both parties to practice the 2019 kite
 dekhnaa yah he ki is aitihaasik chunaav main janata kisko kahati he kaai po che! The Congress is set to raise the Maharashtra issue in Parliament on Monday and it is in this context that the party's parliamentary strategic group met at the residence of party president Sonia Gandhi

 He said that a meeting was held at Sonia Gandhi's residence on the same issue where Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhary, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad and Organization General Secretary KC Venugopal were present

 He said that Priyanka Gandhi is infamous and drinks too much
 agar vah varanasi se chunaav ladatin to unka bura haal hota
 Swamy said that Congress saved Priyanka Gandhi
 unki buree tarah haar hoti
 He is very unpopular
 bahut zyada sharaab piti hai
 She and her husband are very infamous
 ravivaar ko bhi swami ne priyanka gandhi par talkh tippanee kii thi
 He called Priyanka a thankless daughter
 yah tippanee priyanka ke jail jaakar apane pita ke hatyaron se milane ke sandarbh main kii gai thi
 Recently, during a road show in Sultanpur, Priyanka Gandhi had said that my brother Varun has gone astray
 is par bhi swami palatwaar karte najar aae
 He said that Priyanka and Varun, not Varun, lost their party
 ve log varun kii kamyaabi pachaa nahin paa rahe hai
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has once again questioned PM Modi and Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman regarding the Rafael Deal
 congress adhyaksh kaa kahana he ki is deal ko lekar parde ke peeche kuch khel jarur hua he, or use dabaane ke liye sitaraman kisi ke dabaav main kaam kar rahi hai
 In fact, on Sunday, in a tweet about Rahul's Rafael deal, Rahul targeted PM Modi, he reiterated what he said in his speech during the motion of no confidence in Lok Sabha
 rahul kii maane to rakshaamantri kisi ke dabaav rafel deal ko lekar sahi baaten nahin rakh paa rahi hai
 Whereas in a tweet about PM Modi it is written that there was a nervous look behind the smile in his Parliament, so he could not see me
 nishchit taur par rafel saude main ab ghotaale kaa shaq gaharaata ja rahaa he
 PM gets uncomfortable after asking for the price of Rafael
 Our Defence Minister said she would, but now she won’t
 She flip flops between "it's-not-a-secret" & "it's-a-big-secret"
 The PM squirms when asked about the price of RAFALE and refuses to look me in the eye
 Sure smells like a scam
 # rafalescam— Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi)july 22, 2018rahul ke khilaaf visheshadhikaar hanan kaa noticewahin bijepi rafel deal par rahul ke die bayaan ko lekar palatwaar kii taiyaari main he
 Four BJP mps have given notice of breach of privilege against Rahul Gandhi
 notice main kaha gaya he ki congress adhyaksh ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ke khilaaf ‘galat’ aarope lagaakar sansad ko gumraah kiya
 BJP mps Nishikant Dubey, Anurag Thakur, Dushyant Singh and Prahlad Joshi have served notice to the Lok Sabha Speaker
 sansadeey kaary mantri anant kumaar ne kaha tha ki sadan ke niyamon ke anusaar kisi sadsy ke khilaaf aarope lagane se pehle gandhi ko notice dena chahie tha, unhen loksabhaa adhyaksh ko aaropon ke samarthan main saamagree saunpny chahie thi
 Rahul Gandhi had alleged that Sitharaman misled the country by saying that India was bound by confidentiality terms in the Rafale deal with France
 sansad main rahul ne uthaaya tha muddagauratlab he ki avishvaas prastaav ke dauraan loksabhaa main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne sarkaar par rafel saude ke byore saajha karne ke mudde par desh se ‘‘jhooth’’ bolne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kathith bhrashtachar ke maamalon main ‘‘bhagidaar’’ hai, ‘‘chaukeedaar’’ nahin
 During the debate on the no-confidence motion against the NDA government in the Lok Sabha, Rahul said in his speech that the President of France had clearly told him during a meeting that there was no problem in sharing the details related to the Rs 58,000 crore Rafale fighter jet
 
 rahul gandhi kii tippanee ke kuch hi ghante baad france ke videsh mantralay ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha ki bharat ke saath 2008 main kiya gaya suraksha samjhauta gopneey he or donon deshon ke bich raksha upkarnon kii sanchaalan kshamtaaon ke sambandh main is gopneeyata kii raksha karnaa kanoonee rup se badhyakaari he
 He, however, did not clarify whether the provisions of the agreement prevent the Indian government from disclosing the details of the price associated with the Rafale deal
 congress rafel saude main bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaati rahi he or upkaran evam hathiyaaron kii keemat sahit usase jude byore maangati rahi he lekin sarkaar france ke saath gopneey samjhaute kaa hawala dete hue byore saajha karne se inkaar karti rahi he
 Rahul also targeted Modi on the issue of alleged corruption, attacking Modi
 unhone kaha, 'main unhen muskuraate dekh saktaa hum, ghabrahat kii jhalak he
 He is looking away, not looking into my eyes
 ' rahul kii is tippanee par satta paksh se virodh tej ho gaya jiske baad vipakshi sadasyon ne apni seat se khadey hokar unka saamana kiya
 Rahul said in Parliament that Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is lying to the country under pressure from the Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki kiski madad kii ja rahi he, kyon kii ja rahi he, nirmalajee, pradhanmantri desh ko bataaen
 However, Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman called Congress President Rahul Gandhi's allegation that there was no confidentiality agreement between France and India in the context of the Rafale aircraft deal
 sitaraman ne kaha ki ladaaku vimaan kharidne ke liye bharat or france ke bich 2008 main samjhauta hua tha

 sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) kaa dayera alag hone par jor dete hue bhaajapa ne aaj kaha ki sansad kii lok lekha samiti (piesi) ke samaksh pesh hone kii pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii peshkash kaa koi matlab nahin he
 However PAC President Murali Manohar Joshi has clarified that 2
 ji spectrum maamle main jaanch ke liye unka panel swatantra rup se kaam kar rahaa he
 Senior BJP leader Joshi's opinion is different from that of Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj
 sushamaa kii daleel he ki piesi kisi mantri tak ko bhi nahin bula sakati, pradhanmantri kii to baat hi chhod di jaae
 He has tweeted, as per Lok Sabha rules, PAC cannot even call a minister, the Prime Minister is far from done
 aise main pradhanmantri kii peshkash kaa koi matlab nahin he
 His statement came a day after Singh's offer in which the Prime Minister wrote a letter to Joshi, stating that he was ready to appear before the PAC
 joshi jepisi kii maang sambandhi abhiyaan ko lekar bahut utsaahi nahin dikh rahe hai
 He had said yesterday that the PAC would take the appropriate decision at the "appropriate time" under Singh's offer under rules and procedures
 sushamaa ne kaha ki piesi kaa dayera jepisi se puri tarah alag he
 While PAC is related to accounting, JPC is associated with governance and accountability
 loksabhaa niyamon ke anusaar 22 sadasyeey piesi kisi mantri ko gavaahi dene ke liye nahin bula sakati
 But the chairman of the committee can hold informal talks with the minister on any issue of investigation
 pradhanmantri kii peshkash abhootpurv maamla he
 In such a situation, the Lok Sabha Speaker may have to consider the process in this regard

 It's disgusting if # Salmanis insulting a struggler # Arhanon the national TV, even though i didn't like # Arhan! Salman can tell this all to # Rashmisecretly also
 Today Salman has finished the career of # Arhanwhich is really bad
 # Salmanis also having many things to explain

 In a tweet, he wrote - It is disgusting to insult a Strugler on national television
 haalanki, main arhan ko pasand nahin karata hum
 But Salman Khan should have told all this separately to Rashmi
 aaj salmaan khan ne arhan kaa kariyar khatm kar diya he, jo behad dukh kii baat he
 Izzat sabhi ki Hoti hai, Salman Ko Bhi insaan ko insaan Samajhna Chahiye! Salman khan Ne Aaj Arhan Ko Barbad Karke, Ye Sabit Kar Diya Hai, Ki Iss Shakhs ko Behad Guroor Hai, Aur Allah Ko Guroor Bilkul Pasand Nahi Hai! # biggboss13— KRK (@kamaalrkhan) December 7, 2019 KRK wrote in his second tweet Everyone has respect, Salman should also consider a human being a human being
 salmaan khan ne aaj arhan ko barbaad karke ye sabit kar diya he ki is shaks ko bahut gurur he or allaah ko gurur bilkul pasand nahin he
 Let us know that KRK follows Bigg Boss closely and puts his views about the contestants through social media

 civil kii pariksha ke dauraan unki maa kii tabiyat behad kharaab ho gai thi, phir bete kii padhai par asar padegaa ye sochate hue kuch nahin bataaya
 Pradeep spent two years in Delhi and prepared for the exam with all his passion
 aaj jab ve kamyaabi hasil kar apane sapane ko saakaar karne main safal rahe hai, apane mata-pita ke sangharshon ko yaad kar unki ankhen nam ho jaati hai

 While giving special emphasis on online, Pradeep says that my focus will also be on online, so that people can directly access those facilities from home or nearby

 Earlier on 26 July 2005 it rained
 us vakt 944 millimetre barish hui thi, media report ke anusaar 1100 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 The rainfall this time is not less, but it seems that the preparation is better, so the loss of life and property is not like 2005

 Air flights are badly affected
 barish se pehle taiyaari ko lekar 3 june ko hindustan times ne ek report kii thi

 In this report, the reporter has talked to the engineer of bmc's Starm Water Department

 There has been 375 mm of rain till the morning of 2 July

 But he has an old article called scroll

 unhone likhaa he ki june 1985 main mumbai main maheene bhar main 1000 millimetre se adhik barish ho gai thi
 The BMC then hired British consultant Watson Hawksley to plan the city how to deal with 50 mm of rain in an hour
 aath saal lagaakar report taiyaar kii gai, lekin biemasi ne lagu karne main 12 saal or laga die
 There is a budget of crores

 These records are telling that now we cannot trust our old experiences of Mumbai rains
 ham jin raaston ko surakshit samajhate hai unheen raaston par dubaa dena vaala pani jamaa ho saktaa he
 Perhaps this would be the reason why two people in the SUV vehicle continued to move even after the water had accumulated and eventually drowned in the car, killing them
 do logon kii yah maut bataa rahi he ki barish ko lekar mumbai ke sadiyon or dashakon ke anubhavon kaa bharosa ab chhod dena chahie
 Old experiences will no longer work
 mumbai kii barish kabhi bhi dhokhaa de sakati he
 In addition to the sea, Mumbai had its own system of rivers and marshy land
 ham dhire-dhire un par kabza karte chale gaye
 These natural systems were tools to protect the metropolis

 The scale of natural disasters is getting bigger

 jaagrukta lani hogi
 When the sands of the rivers were being looted, industrial wastes were being released in their water, then the common people were not appealed to stop them

 da great dirrangement pengivan ne chhaapi he or 399 rupee kii kitaab he
 Do read this baharhaal di great dirrangement main mumbai par jo chapter aata he uske bare main zikr karnaa chahta hum
 For your Hindi audience
 amitabh ghosh is kitaab main jalwaayu parivartan ko lekar kai sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 He says that we are still assuming that nothing will happen, will not happen here, will not be there
 iskaa aadhaar hamaare dashakon yaa sadiyon ke anubhav hai isliye jab kuch achaanak bada ho jaataa he, pralayakari ho jaataa he to ham kehete hai ki samaj nahin aayaa kaise ho gaya
 But now you see these devastations caused by climate change across the world
 bharat main hi dekhie aapako pataa chalegaa ki aap bhale na samajhane ke liye taiyaar hue hon, prakruti aapke peeche pad gai he
 Amitabh Ghosh is writing about the flood and cyclone fears over Mumbai
 aap sochenge ki mumbai main cyclone kahaan se aa gaya
 Actually, this question was written by Amitabh Ghosh to an American professor
 pataa chalata he ki aupniveshik daur main yani jab portugali or angrezon kaa raaj rahaa tab mumbai main kai baar cyclone aayaa
 Today's Mumbaikars may not think that a cyclone like Hurricane Sandy can come here like New York, but there have been cyclones in Mumbai
 1783 main aisa jabardast chakravaat aayaa tha ki 400 log mar gaye the
 There are records of cyclonic storms in the 19th and early twentieth centuries
 2009 main bhi mumbai main chakravaat aayaa tha magar tab hawa kii raftaar 85 kilometre prati ghante hi thi jo ki kaaphi dhimi thi
 New York's Hurricane Sandy had a top speed of 185 kilometers per hour
 us vakt neuyark ke meyar bloomberg ne shandaar kaam kiya tha tab bhi 285 log maare gaye the
 Not only this, reading the Great Derangement, it was found that these days the number of cyclonic storms on the shores of Arabian Sea has started to increase which will increase further in the coming time
 usee tarah bengal kii khadi main chakravaati tufaanon kii sankhya kam hone lagegi
 Amitabh has written that if a cyclone comes in Mumbai then its gateway of India will be destroyed where the rich population lives
 jise na mangrove van ke kaate jane se fark padataa he or na mithi nadi ko mitaa die jane se
 The mirrors that are installed in the tall buildings of Mumbai will be uprooted
 kul milakar mumbai na to 1000 millimetre se adhik barish ke liye taiyaar nazar aati he na hi chakravaat ke liye
 Because whenever the cyclone has hit Mumbai before, its population was less than one million
 aaj do karod se adhik thi
 You can guess the devastation, if not, it is better that you keep on whatsapp, concentrate in the Good Morning Message
 kuch nahin hoga
 What you wanted to happen is now done
 chennai kii baadh ke chaar saal hue hai
 The Madas High Court had said that encroachments should be removed from the banks of the Adyar and Kuam rivers
 yah bhi check kar sakate hai
 We are amazing people for not talking about doing anything
 agar mumbai ke kawarej ko dekhte hue kisi ko yah lag rahaa he ki uske shahar main nahin hoga to use kerala kii baadh yaad kar leni chahie
 That flood of Gurugram should be remembered in August 2018
 29 agast ko paanch ghante ke bheetar 121 millimetre barish ho gai thi
 It did not rain for eight years, but it happened that day
 ghanton log jam main fanse rahe
 20 feet deep water had accumulated near Hero Honda Chowk
 gurugram ke log milinium milinium twit karte rahe lekin jalwaayu parivartan unhen chetavanee de kar ja chukaa tha
 Can not say with the claim that when such rains occur, everything will not happen in Gurugram
 jalwaayu parivartan ke sawaal par aa jaaie
 There is hundreds of research on this
 saare export aakar chetavanee de rahe hai jo ho bhi rahaa he
 Therefore there is no lack of awareness
 agar aditya thakare jalwaayu parivartan kii baat kar rahe hai to suniye lekin unase puuchhie bhi jalwaayu parivartan kaa khyaal isi saal aayaa he
 Why didn't you come first? ab jab aa hi gaya to wo kya karne ja rahe hai
 Will they stop 54,000 mangrove trees from being cut for the bullet train? kuch samay ko chhod den to 1985 se lekar aaj tak shivasena hi biemasi main raaj karti rahi he
 That's why Beansi becomes his accountability
 mumbai sirf bachaane aati he
 The city performs splendidly during the time of destruction
 ek ek karmchaaree kaam par lag jate hai
 Identify the hero engaged in rescue work but also find the villain who has been responsible for all these for decades
 is bich shiv sena ke saansad sanjay raut ke ek twit par nazar pad gai
 i got emotional after seeing his poem
 aisi kavitaayen aapako trakon par, line hotalon kii deevaaron par,bas adde main khub padhane ko milti hai
 Sharechat and whatsapp and Tick Talk are full of such poems and poetry
 jaisaa pani kaa level he vaisaa hi shaayari kaa level he
 First we will fix the climate change, then later we will see the problem of poetry
 to sanjay raut ji kii kavita he
 
 
 When the Prime Minister gave the tiger coat to Ghalib, critics said that Ghalib did not say so, it must have come from the whatsapp world
 to usee se prabhavit hokar hamane internet main search kiya sanjay raut ji kii shaayari kaa pataa karne ke liye
 However, he has not claimed in his tweet that he has written
 phir bhi hamane check kiya ki ye kavita ai kahaan se
 a similar poem has been found in the Love Shayari section of Sad Shayari
com
 harmany shaayari daat kaam ke section barish shaayari main yah kavita mili he
 Sanjay Raut has already tweeted by adding only rain to this poem
 kya hamaare saansad mumbai se zyada harmany shaayari or lav shaayari daat com par zyada samay bitaa rahe hai
 Very Sad and Very Funny
 yah kavita aapako internet par khub milegi
 We regret that in the same way that we could not find the responsible for the destruction of Mumbai, in the same way popular among lovers could not find the creator of this poem
 tabhi kaha ki kavita se main bhavuk ho jaataa hum
 Where have you gone astray? main sanjay raut ji ko habib jaalib kii kitaab dena chahta hum
 i will also give Ghalib's sake so that no one confuse Ghalib
 isliye aap biemasi kii javabdehi or jalwaayu parivartan ko lekar kanfus na ho
 The reasons for climate change are not just in Mumbai
 dilli kii raajnneeti main bhi hai
 There are also those policies which we keep praising
 pichley 11 maheene main bharat main 5 badi prakritik aapadaaen ain hai
 Climate change is the only reason for all
 isane lakhon logon ko prabhavit kiya he
 Kerala floods
 chennai kaa sookhaa, odisha kaa cyclone phoni, bharat bhar main bhayankar garmi
 Mumbai rain
 ham bhul chuke hai ki may or june main taapmaana aasmaan chhu rahaa tha
 In Churu, the 50 degree Celsius temperature went up and records of maximum temperature in Delhi were broken
 lu ke kaaran bihar main hi kitne logon kii maut ho gai
 It is not a half-digit number, but the media has written the number of people dying of heathen to 185 and some to 150
 chennai main 198 dinon tak koi barish hi nahin hui
 This is also a record
 das saal main sabase adhik barish mumbai main hoti he yah bhi record he
 If your work goes on record, write it down, but natural disaster is coming to test your preparations and also to punish your negligence
 jalwaayu parivartan ke sawaal kaa jawaab biemasi yaa emsidi ke paas nahin he, na hoga
 They have those to whom we entrust political accountability
 is vakt hamaari raajnneeti ke paas jo arth niti he usase tees chalis saalon ke bheetar hi hamaari sainkadon nadiyaan gaayab ho gayi
 Turned into drain
 vahaan par building ban gai
 Became runways
 raajnneeti aapse kahegi ki is samasya kaa hal sabko milakar karnaa he
 Till now you were understanding the meaning of political alternative from party or leader
 isaki jagah aarthik vikalp kii baat shuru kar dijie
 The policies that are underway in which we dream are just new records of destruction
 mumbai se hamaare sahyogiyon ne jo report bheji he wo aapke saamne he
 Remember, love poetry will not solve the problem of climate change

 ) gujarat ke congress netaa shankarasingh waghela ne aarope lagaaya he ki bhaajapa alpsankhyakon ko pasand nahin karti
 In New Delhi on Wednesday, a day after his party made a statement on its party's dependence on minorities, he said that the BJP disliked the minorities and wanted to send them to Pakistan
 mangalvaar ko die apane ek bayaan par puche gaye ek sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue waghela ne kaha ki congress aam aadmi kii party he or koi jaagruk naagarik use vot detaa he to isamen galat kya he
 Significantly, Vaghela, while addressing a meeting of minorities on Tuesday, said that the Congress party is accused of being pro-muslim, so it is up to the Muslims to win it
 unke is bayaan ke baad bhaajapa ne congress par musalamaanon ko votbank kii tarah istemaal karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 On this statement, Vaghela said that he was addressing the minority cell of his party and he did not intend to target any community
 tippaniyan Vaghela said, Sikhs, Parsis and Christians were also present in that meeting and if a conscious citizen votes for a party that cares about him then what is wrong with it
 agar bhaajapa ise kisi duusare chashme se dekhnaa chaahati he to main kya kar saktaa hum
 Significantly, before joining the Congress, Vaghela started his political career with the BJP
 gujarat main apni party kii alpsankhyakon par nirbharta vaala bayaan dene ke ek din baad buudhvaar ko nai dilli main unhone kaha ki bhaajapa alpsankhyakon ko naapsand karti he or unhen pakistan bhejnaa chaahati he
 Responding to a question asked on one of his statements on Tuesday, Vaghela said that Congress is the party of the common man and if a conscious citizen votes for him then what is wrong with it
 gauratlab he ki waghela ne mangalvaar ko alpsankhyakon kii ek baithak ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki congress party par muslim samarthak hone kaa aarope lagata he, isiilie use jitaane kii jimmedaari musalamaanon par hi he
 After his statement, the BJP accused the Congress of using Muslims as vote banks
 apane is bayaan par waghela ne kaha ki vah apni party ke alpsankhyak prakoshth ko sambodhit kar rahe the or unki manshaa kisi samudaay ko nishaanaa banane kii nahin thi
 The comments waghela ne kaha, us baithak main sikh, parsi or isai bhi maujuud the or agar koi jaagruk naagarik aisi party ko vot detaa he, jo uski parvaah karti ho to isamen galat kya he
 What can i do if the BJP wants to see it through some other glasses
 gauratlab he ki congress main jane se pehle waghela ne apane raajnneetik jivan kii shuruyaat bhaajapa se hi kii thi

 charchaa ko aage badhaate hue somvanshi ne mobile par sher sunaate hue kaha ki aaj agar koi pareshaan hokar phir rahaa he to samaj lijie uskaa mobile gum ho gaya
 He further read the lion, uff loneliness has increased so much, everyone has only selfies in his mobile
 aage kaha ki tumhaari baat puri sun rahaa hum, meri aawaaj kyon jaati nahin he, ye dikkat phone ke network jaisi kahaan se apane bich aa gai he
 Pratap Somvanshi shared many such lions with the audience
 kaise janmi hongi kahavaeinkavi sanjay kundan ne kaha ki shabd manushya kii utpatti se hi jude hue hai pehle patton par likhte the, phir kaagaj or ab mobile par likh rahe hai
 He narrated the poem on the birth of proverbs, saying how much must have been laughing, the man who must have joked with a camel, placing a grain of cumin in his mouth
 
 
 sachmuch bada fakkad rahaa hoga vah jisane chhachhundar ke sir par chameli kaa tel male jane kii baat sochi hogi
 Photo- Asifsanjaya Kundan said that think about the birth of the proverbs, who would have said that for the first time the water scarcity should be reflected
 
 
 ve hamaare purvaj the jinhen na prasiddh hona tha or na kavi bananaa tha
 This is the reason that he did not add his name to the proverbs, he must have been a bitter critic of life
 unamem koi utsaahi mallaah rahaa hoga jisane nishkarsh nikaala jin khoja tin paaiyaan
 
 
 Those anonymous ancestors would not have learned to be afraid because they would tease them by calling death a wolf
 aaj chaalaak kaviyon or pryojit shabdon ko daur he, kaash main is daur ke bare main ek sateek kahawat kah paata
 Poet and journalist Nidhish Tyagi said that since 20 years have been covering bad news, in such a situation, poems protect us to remain human because we live a lot of Tamasi lives, have worked night shift for years
 unhone apni kavita 'pichley ek ghante main' padhakar sunai
 Its lyrics were in the last hour
 
 
 prithvi par is vakt aabaadi 7 arab se zyada he, har ghante kii tarah is ghante bhi kai karod log rosemara ke baaki kaamon kii tarah istemaal karenge pyaar naam kaa shabd, is ghante is shabd ke karodon istemaal kaa jo ausat arth hoga, vahi matlab us ghante ke itihaas main darj or sach mana jayega, par har kisi kaa sandarbh or prasang jaruri nahin vahi ho, jo ghante ke ausat se nikaala jayega
 Nidhish said while reading the poem further
 
 
 pyaar ke naam par koi phisal pattee par hoga, koi dadhak rahaa hoga, koi kud rahi hoga jalkukadi ban, koi salike se jhooth kah rahaa hoga, koi shaq se jard ho rahaa hoga, koi yakeen par badalane par raakh, koi jism main tatol rahaa hoga pyaar jaisaa kuch, koi rishton ke aar-paar, koi khudakushi ke tareekon kaa google kar rahaa hoga, koi sihar-pasar-thithak guzar rahaa hoga, koi uchhal-phudak-daud bhi rahaa hoga, ankhon main jhaankne ke liye
 
 
 Love will not be the average love
 dhokhaa dekar vot liya
 
 
 Poet Alok Yadav recited his ghazal, "who will say my heart's heart, leave it, who will listen to the crazy
" 
 
 jiske jhooth par balihaari jate ho tum, wo tumse kya sach bolegaa chodo bhi
 
 
 The chameleon is adept at changing colors, but will also be able to win over humans
 
 
 tumne uski baat suni or maan bhi lee, ab wo tumhaari baat sunegaa chodo bhi
 
 
 Let go of the insistence on listening to the truth, let me leave you every single word
 
 Cheated and won the vote, now he will leave your work too
 
 If you go away, i will go, but who will take care of you? kavi nidhish tyaagi ne apni kavit itani aatma bhi padhakar sunai
 Sanjay then won the hearts of the audience by reciting his poem Mannama

 a post shared by Nirahua (@dineslalyadav) on Dec 3, 2018 at 12:53am PST India's Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee has said that we are against all forms of terrorism and at the same time India has no sympathy with LTTE
 gauratlab he ki srilanka main sena or altitii ugravadiyon ke bich aakhri daur kii jang ke bich bhartiya videsh mantri pranab mukherjee aaj se do din ke lanka daure par ja rahe hai
 During this time, the Foreign Minister will meet the President of Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa and Foreign Minister Rohita Bogolgama and discuss the current situation
 is daure main videsh mantri pranab mukherjee lankai netaaon par is baat kaa dabaav bhi banaaenge, ki vahaan rah rahe tamilon ko dusron ke baraabar adhikaar die jaaen
 It is believed that since the military attack on the LTTE fighting for the rights of Sri Lankan Tamils, many Indian Tamil leaders, including Karunanidhi, have been continuously pressurizing the Center to ask the Sri Lankan government for a political solution rather than military action
 vaiseis bich badi khabar yahi he ki srilanka sena ne altitii ke aakhri garh malaitivu par bhi kabja kar liya he, haalanki chhitput ladaai is vakt bhi chal rahi hai, magar altitii ke ugravadi jangalo main bhaagane ko majaboor ho gaye hai
 There is also talk of LTTE chief Prabhakaran, whose name is included in the charge sheet of the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi murder case
 isisi cricket vishwacap-2011 ke aadhikarik shubhankar 'stampi' ko duniya ke saamne laayaa ja chukaa he
 'stumpy' is largely the same as 'appu', the 1982 Asian Games mascot, but it remains to be seen whether Stumpy gains Appu-like popularity
 appu deshavaasiyon kii jubaan par chadh gaya tha
 Appu Ghar was built in his name in the Pragati Maidan campus in Delhi, where children used to come and have fun with their parents
 appu-ghar ab nahin he
 It has been demolished to build a cabin of lawyers of the Supreme Court
 appu kaa bhi intkaal ho chukaa he, lekin deshvasi ab tak na to appu ko bhuule hai or na hi appu-ghar ko
 Stumpy has the challenge of becoming as popular as Appu
 cricket kii lokapriyata kii aandhi main is shubhankar ko lokapriyata mil sakati he, lekin cricket mukaable jis teji se khele ja rahe hai, unhen dekhte hue stampi kuch varshon baad kitabon main khokar rah saktaa he
 It may be that he does not get a chance to rule the hearts of cricket-obsessed Indian people
 rashtramandal khelon ke shubhankar shera ko logon ne 11 dinon tak khub yaad kiya, lekin uske baad khelon se judi bhrashtachar kii khabaron ke bich shera kahin gum ho gaya
 There is currently no place for corruption in international cricket and this is why Stumpy is not expected to be like Shera, but will be able to gain popularity like Appu, there is a question mark
 stampi ke rup main isisi ne ek 10 varsh ke kaalpanik hathi ko duniya ke saamne pesh kiya he
 It is very young, determined and full of enthusiasm
 isaki jo aadhikarik tasviir jari kii gai he, usamen ise cricket gend ke saath dikhaaya gaya he
 It was unveiled in Sri Lanka on 2 April 2010
 us samay iskaa namakaran nahin kiya gaya tha
 The name Stumpy was revealed through an online survey conducted worldwide by the ICC
 isisi ne july, 2010 main ek online pratiyogita karai thi, jiske madhyam se prashansakon ko apane shubhankar kaa naam sujhane ko kaha gaya tha
 For this, fans were given a month's time
 iske baad 2 agast, 2010 ko isisi na apane shubhankar kaa naam stampi rakhe jane kii ghoshnaa kii
 The ICC believes that Stumpy considers cricket to be the best game in the world and always thinks about it
 ise galiyon or chauraahon par cricket khelnaa zyada pasand he

 Senior BJP leader LK Advani, Amit Shah as well as Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia attended the funeral of Mrs Kaul, who was with Vajpayee for a long time
 bataa den ki saal 2014 main rajkumaari kaul kaa dil kaa daura padane kii vajah se nidhan ho gaya tha
 His death brought an end to a friendship that was rarely seen before in Indian politics
 rajkumaari kaul kai dashakon tantal bihari vaajapeyike saath raheen
 Vajpayee also adopted his daughter Namita Bhattacharya
 wo kai saal tak saath hi raheen
 Till Vajpayee became the Prime Minister
 koun thim misses kaul?pichley hafte 16 agast ko shaam paanch bajkar paanch baje jab vaajapeyi kaa dehanth hua to rajkumaari kaul kii kahani bhi charchaa kaa vishay ban gai
 During this, there were questions that who was Mrs
 Kaul? Who was known for her husband's surname
 phir wo yani misses kaul vaajapeyi kii saathi kaise?40 ke dashak mejhtal bihari vaajapeyior rajkumaari hakasar,gwaliormen victoria college (ab lakshmibai college) main pard rahe the
 Both of them understood each other's feelings
 vibhaajan ke us daur main kisi ladke or ladki ke bich kii dosti ko saraahaa nahin jaataa tha
 Vajpayee and Mrs
 Kaul were also going through this situation
 vaajapeyi ne apni bhaawanaaon kaa izhaar ek patr ke madhyam se kiya, jise unhone rajkumaari ke liye librari kii ek kitaab main rakh diya tha
 Rajkumari also gave a similar reply, although his reply did not reach Vajpayee
 bharat vibhaajan ke dauraan rajkumaari ke kashmiri pandit pita govind narayan hakasar ne unki shaadi kashmiri pandit brij narayan kaul se kar di
 Actually, Haksar did not want to marry his daughter to a man, which later proved to be a change in Indian politics
 vaajapeyi or rajkumaari hakasar, donin apni jindagi main ram gaye
 Later Mrs Kaul moved to Delhi with her husband and Vajpayee reached Lucknow via Kanpur
 misses kaul ke pati bean kaul, ramajas college main professor the or baad main ramajas hostel main warden bhi bane
 a few years later, Vajpayee became a fully politician
 ek lambey vakt ke baad dilli main vaajapeyi kaa misses kaul se milanaa hua
 At that time, Princess Kaul was the wife of BN Kaul
 bean kaul us vakt hostel main rahane vaale chaatro ke plan main roda ban jate the, jab wo sharaab pine ke liye der se hostel aane kii yojana banaate the
 At this time someone made a plan to complain to Mrs
 Kaul
 jab hostel main rahane vaale chaatro kaa group kaul ke ghar shikaayat karne pahunchaa to kaha jaataa he ki us vakt unka saamana vaajapeyi se bhi hua
 For the next several years, Vajpayee was a frequent visitor to Kaul's home
 baad main vaajapeyi kaul house main shift ho gaye jabaki us vakt tak professor kaul ramajas college ke warden the
 But when Atal Bihari Vajpayee became the foreign minister in the Morarji government in 1978, he shifted to government housing with Mrs
 Kaul and his daughters
 unhone kaul kii beti namita or baad main unki dohiti niharika ko god le liya
 Former President Pranab Mukherjee also told Hindustan Times in an interview, 'we used to live in Vajpayee's neighborhood
 gharon kii diwaar se laga ek darwaja tha, jisase ki donon parivaar ke log aasaani se aa-ja sake
 He was fond of fish
 namita aksar hamaare ghar aati thi
 My wife and Mrs
 Kaul had a good bonding
 jab namita kii shaadi tay hui to meri patni ne taiyaari kii thi, kyonki duulhaa bengali tha
 Please tell that Namita was married to Ranjan Bhattacharya
 vaajapeyi kii misses kaul ke saath dosti kii charchaa media main nahin hui
 This was an undisclosed agreement between the media and Vajpayee, on which neither the media showed interest nor did Vajpayee think it needed clarification
 misses kaul ne ek baar ek magazine ko intervyuu diya tha
 In this interview, he said, there is no need to convince anyone about his friendship with Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 misses kaul ne kaha, pati ke saath bhi unka rishta kaaphi majboot he
 However, Vajpayee was very ill and in bed when Mrs
 Kaul died many years later
 wo unke antim sanskaar main shaamil nahin ho paae the
 But after Vajpayee's death, it was Namita who offered him ashes
