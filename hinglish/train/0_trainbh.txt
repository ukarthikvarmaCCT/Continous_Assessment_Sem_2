 Digvijay Singh- What was not told to Rahul Gandhiji, what was not told to Soniaji, should we get distracted by that, we do not get distracted
 narendra modi ji vichlit ho jate hai
 Do you remember when Karan Thapar asked him some questions, he went out
 kisi bhi ek congress netaa kaa naam bataaen jisane badasluki kii ho
 We know how to cope
 ye sangh ke log nahin jaanate
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think this social media can be unbridled? digvijay singh− vichaaron kii azaadi har prajatantr main hoti he
 We have a law for this and we should work within the scope of the law
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki shivaraj singh chouhan yah ishaara kar rahe hai ki modi ke samarthak bijepi ke samarthak nahin hai
 Digvijay Singh - i do not get into a fight with him
 manoranjan bharti− rahul banaam modi ko maanakar aap chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahe hai? Digvijay Singh- Modi is not an issue for us
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara kii ladaai he
 Our fight is against the people who killed Mahatma Gandhi, the ideology that ruined the communal harmony, which exploded bombs to discredit the minority community in the country
 kattarpanthi vichaardhaara kii ladaai
 The Congress party has been fighting since independence and will fight even further
 manoranjan bharti− aapako nahin lagata ki agar aap modi kii baton ko point tu point counter karenge to turant sachai pataa chalata he
 Digvijay Singh - Indicators of the states of the country, whether it is a Human Development Index, whether it is Capita Income, FDI, Investment in Manufacturing Sector or Implementation of Annual Use, Gujarat is not number one in any criterion
 agar aap human devlepment index dekhenge to kerala number van par he jahaan congress kii sarkaar he
 But if we look at the capita income, Haryana is at number one where the Congress is ruling
 manuphaccharing sactor or epadiai main dekhenge to maharashtra number van par he
 Gujarat is number one on which stage
 sabase zyada kuposhan vahiin bad rahaa he, sabase zyada mahilaon kii sankhya vahiin ghat rahi he
 Gujarat's growth rate has always been 2–4 more than India's growth rate
 dabl disit growth to gujarat main 90 ke dashak main bhi rahaa he
 The credit does not go to Modi
 iskaa shrey gujarat ke udyogpatiyon ko jaataa he
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think that industrialists want Modi to become PM? digvijay singh− jinako unhonen muft main karodon kii zamin di hai, jinako unhone tex main hazaron karod kaa faaydaa diya he wo unka gungan nahin karenge to kiskaa karenge
 Manoranjan Bharti – will you contest the 2014 election? digvijay singh−party tikat degi to jarur ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - Are you ready? digvijay singh− yahaan se kahin bhi ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharti - Your number of seats in UP will remain the same in 2014
 digvijay singh− yah nahin kaha ja saktaa, par taiyaari puri he or datakar chunaav ladenge
 Entertainment Bharti- Will Priyanka contest elections? Comments digvijay singh− mujhe koi bhi jaankaree nahin he
 Manoranjan bharati-party should have only one power center? digvijay singh− main apni baat kah chukaa hum or oficial spoxperson ne jo baat kahi he main uskaa paalan kar rahaa hum
 Digvijay Singh - You know Mulayam Singh better than me
 manoranjan bharti− upie−2 ko ek confidence vot ke liye is saal ke ant tak taiyaar hona padegaa
 Do you believe this theory? digvijay singh− pehle bhi aise khatre kai baar aae hai or hamaari party ne in khataron kaa saamana bhi kiya he or ham jite bhi hai
 Will be seen when the time comes
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki yadi mulaayam singh hatate bhi hai to congress ke paas paryaapt number rahegaa? Digvijay Singh - This is a big hypothetical question
 mulaayam singh ne yah bayaan diya he ki ham sarkaar nahin giraanaa chaahate
 Manoranjan Bharti - Why does Rahul seem to back down from leading? digvijay singh− wo siaiai ke anual general meeting ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 In this, he has given his views on the problems facing the country, what should be the vision to solve these problems
 congress kii mul dharna jo mahatma gandhi ke samay se rahi hai ki satta kaa vikendrikaran hona chahie or vikendrikrut satta hi samasyaon kaa nidaan kar sakati he
 In the Jaipur session, he said 'power is poison'
 isliye unki maa sonia ji ne kaha tha ki power kaa upyog dusron ko empower karne ke liye karnaa khud ke empower karne ke liye nahin karnaa
 This is a big deal
 yahi buniyadi antar he kangras or bhaajapa-sangh kii vichaardhaara main
 Manoranjan Bharati - The country wants to know how long Rahul will be ready to lead the country
 digvijay singh− aap log koun banegaa pradhanmantri isi par bahes karke apni tiarapy badhanaa chaahate hai
 We do not have a problem as to who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaari samasya yah he ki kaise ham log berogari dur karenge, kaise ham garibi dur karenge, kaise yahaan kaa kuposhan dur karenge, kaise yahaan ke human devlepment indax main sudhaar karenge, kaise growth rate ko badha paaenge, kaise ham ek acha vaataavaran nirmit kar paaenge, jisase naa keval epadiai aae, saath hi manuphaccharing sector main bhi ham zyada se zyada growth badha saken
 How can we employ people through skill development, which is a great achievement of the UPA government, how can we give employment to people through it, how we were given the right to information, right to education, right to work, now right We have given two feet
 manoranjan bharti− kahin yah kuch zyada thurytical to nahin he? Digvijay Singh - Absolutely not
 siem yaa piem kaa bhaashan nahin tha
 Vice President of Congress Party was the speech
 desh kaa har vyakti yah jaananaa chahta tha ki aakhir rahul gandhi brands he kya? bhaashan main rahul gandhi brands hi usamen vyakt kiya gaya
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will your party connect with 14 crore people under social media? digvijay singh− fikki mahila wing kaa kyrkram tha
 Those who are union directors are not married
 ab ye bhi ek bahut bada prashn he ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 In the form they fill in to contest elections, they also keep secret whether they are married or not
 pehali baat to yah he ki is desh kii janata or visheshkar mahila varg yah jaananaa chahta he ki modi ji aap ye spasht kar den ki aap shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The second thing is that they tell women that women should awaken the efforts of the people of the country
 yahi apane aap main sangh kii maansikta ko jaahir karata he
 We want to increase female power
 is desh main mahila shakti badhaane main kisi kaa yogadan rahaa he to congress kaa he
 Rajiv Gandhi gave reservation to women
 jitna bhi desh main mahilaon ke paksh main nirnay hue hai sabhi congress ke rajya sarkaron or centre sarkaar ne liya he
 BJP has done nothing
 main poochna chahta hum modi se ki 35 rajyon kii list main aapke rajya main mail−femail ke anupaat main 32wein number par he
 The number of women is decreasing with you
 iskaa matlab yahi he ki aapke yahaan kanya bhrun hatya kii ghatnaayen bad rahi hai iskaa uttar nahin dete hai or aap mahilaon se sangh prachaarak kii tarah bhaashan dete hai
 We would like Modi to give a lot of speeches so that the people of the country will know how long they will listen to the rhetorical speech, why they do not talk about Yashoda Ben's pizza
 unase puuchhie ki yashoda ben koun hai? Manoranjan Bharati - meaning he was playing with emotions in this gathering digvijay singh− sangh prachaarak kaa bhaashan isi prakaar rata−rataya hota he
 The people of the Sangh are trained in such a way that just look at the road like a horse of a horse and do not look around
 manoranjan bharti− kya modi ke bhaashan main sonia ji kii baat karnaa bul gaye? Digvijay Singh - If he wants to respect women, then accept Sushma Swaraj as the next Prime Minister
 manoranjan bharti− aap soshal media par modi ko kab jawaab denge? Digvijay Singh - Our struggle is not with any person
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara se he
 Today, the ideology of the Sangh on social media justifies Mahatma Gandhi's murder
 mahatma gandhi ke murder ko kahati he ki thik hua
 Should we not oppose it? desh kaa har naagarik jo libral vichaardhaara kaa he jo sampradayik sadbhaav vichaardhaara kaa he, is soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara kaa prabhaav badhata ja rahaa he uskaa ham nirantar virodh karenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - How will your people not be there? digvijay singh− hamaare log puure desh main hai or dhire−dhire hamaara jo penitrishan he bad rahaa he
 What was dominating the Sangh six months ago is no more today and after six months will see where they stand
 manoranjan bharti− aapako acha nahin laga hoga jab rahul gandhi ko pappu kaha gaya hoga
 Digvijay Singh- What was not told to Rahul Gandhiji, what was not told to Soniaji, should we get distracted by that, we do not get distracted
 narendra modi ji vichlit ho jate hai

 Manoranjan Bharti - Your number of seats in UP will remain the same in 2014
 digvijay singh− yah nahin kaha ja saktaa, par taiyaari puri he or datakar chunaav ladenge
 Entertainment Bharti- Will Priyanka contest elections? Comments digvijay singh− mujhe koi bhi jaankaree nahin he
 Manoranjan bharati-party should have only one power center? digvijay singh− main apni baat kah chukaa hum or oficial spoxperson ne jo baat kahi he main uskaa paalan kar rahaa hum
 Digvijay Singh- In the past, such threats have come many times and our party has faced these threats and we have won
 jab samay aayega tab dekha jayega
 Manoranjan Bharti- Do you think that even if Mulayam Singh moves away, will the Congress have sufficient numbers? digvijay singh− yah badaan hipothetical prashn he
 Mulayam Singh has given this statement that we do not want to topple the government
 manoranjan bharti− rahul netritv karne se peeche hatate kyon dikh rahe hai? Digvijay Singh - He was addressing the Annual General Meeting of CII
 isamen desh ke saamne kya samasyaayein hai, in samasyaon ke nidaan ke liye kya vijan hona chahie, is par vistaar se unhone apni baat rakhi he
 The core belief of the Congress, which has been since Mahatma Gandhi's time, is that there should be decentralization of power and only decentralized power can solve the problems
 jaipur ke adhiveshan main unhone kaha tha 'power ij poijan'
 Therefore, his mother Soniaji had said that to use power to mpower others, not to do own mpower
 ye bahut badi baat he
 This is the basic difference between the ideology of Congress and bjp-sangh
 manoranjan bharti− desh jaananaa chahta he ki rahul kab tak desh kaa netritv karne ke liye taiyaar honge
 Digvijay Singh- You want to increase your TRP by arguing on who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaare saamne yah samasya nahin he ki koun banegaa pradhanmantri
 Our problem is that how will we remove unemployment, how will we eradicate poverty, how to eradicate malnutrition, how to improve the human development index, how to increase the growth rate, how we will be able to create a good environment
 , Which not only brings FDI, but also in the manufacturing sector, we can increase maximum growth
 kaise ham log skill devlepment ke sahare jo upie sarkaar kii bahut badi uplabdhi he, kaise ham uske madhyam se logon ko rojgaar de saken, kaise ham log jis tarah se rhite tu information diya, rhite tu ajukeshan diya, rhite tu work diya, ab rhite tu foot ham logon ne diya he
 Manoranjan Bharati - Is it anything more theatrical? digvijay singh− bilkul nahin
 There was no speech of CM or PM
 vaais president of congress party kaa bhaashan tha
 Everybody in the country wanted to know whether Rahul Gandhi is the brand? The Rahul Gandhi brand was expressed in the speech
 manoranjan bharti− soshal media ke tahat 14 karod logon se aapaki party kab judegi? Digvijay Singh - FICCI was the women's wing program
 sangh sanchaalak jo hote hai wo shaadi−shuda nahin hote hai
 Now this is also a very big question whether they are married or not
 ye chunaav ladane ke liye jo form bharte hai, usamen bhi gupt rakhte hai ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The first thing is that the people of this country and especially the women class want to know that Modi ji should make it clear whether you are married or not
 duusari baat yah he ki wo mahilaon ko kehete hai ki mahilaayein desh kaa ham logon kaa purusharth jaagrit karen
 This itself shows the Sangh's mindset
 ham mahila shakti ko badhanaa chaahate hai
 If anyone has contributed to increase women's power in this country, then it is the Congress
 rajeev gandhi ne mahilaon ko aarakshan diya
 As much as decisions have been taken in favor of women in the country, all Congress state governments and the central government have taken it
 bhaajapa ne kuch nahin kiya he
 i want to ask Modi that in the list of 35 states, your state is at number 32 in the ratio of male-female
 aap ke yahaan mahilaon kii sankhya ghat rahi he
 This means that the incidence of female feticide is increasing in your home and you do not answer it and you give speeches to women like Sangh Pracharak
 ham to chahenge ki modi khub bhaashan den taaki desh kii janata ko maaloom to pade ki rata−rataya bhaashan kitna din sunenge wo yashoda ben ke pizza kii baat kyon nahin karte
 Ask them who is Yashoda Ben? manoranjan bharti− matlab wo is sabha main bhaawanaaon se khel rahe the The speech of Digvijay singh-sangh Pracharak is like this
 sangh ke logon kii training is prakaar hoti he ki taange ke ghode kii tarah sirf sadak par dekho or aas−paas mat dekho
 Manoranjan Bharti - Did Modi's speech speak of Soniaji in Modi's speech? digvijay singh− agar wo mahilaon kii izzat karnaa chaahate hai to sushamaa swaraj ko agle pradhanmantri ke rup main sweekaar kar len
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will you reply to Modi on social media? digvijay singh− hamaara sangharsh kisi vyakti se nahin he
 Our fight is against ideology
 soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara he aaj mahatma gandhi ke murder ko jastiphai karti he
 Mahatma tells Gandhi's murder that healed
 kya iskaa ham log virodh naa karen
 Every citizen of the country, who is of the Liberal ideology, who is of the communal harmony ideology, we will continue to oppose the growing influence of the Sangh ideology on this social media
 manoranjan bharti− kaise karenge, aapke log to he nahin vahaan par
 Digvijay Singh - Our people are all over the country and gradually our penetration is increasing
 jo chah maheene pehle sangh kaa dabadabaa tha aaj wo nahin he or chah maheene baad dekhenge ki wo kahaan khadey hai
 Manoranjan Bharti- You might not have liked it when Rahul Gandhi was called Pappu
 digvijay singh− rahul gandhi ji ko kya−kya nahin kaha gaya, sonia ji ko kya nahin kaha gaya, kya ham usase vichlit ho jaaen humlog vichlit nahin hote
 Narendra Modi ji gets distracted
 aapako yaad he karan thapar ne jab unase kuch prashn puche to ve nikalakar baahar chale gaye
 Name any one Congress leader who has misbehaved
 ham saamana karnaa jaanate hai
 These Sangh people do not know
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki ye soshal media belgaum ho saktaa he? Digvijay Singh - Freedom of thought exists in every democracy
 hamaare yahaan iske liye kanoon bana hua he or kanoon ke daayre main rahakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Manoranjan Bharti- You think that Shivraj Singh Chauhan is pointing out that Modi's supporters are not bjp's supporters
 digvijay singh− mujhe unke jhagade main nahin padana
 Recreation Bharti- Are you preparing for the election by assuming Rahul vs Modi? digvijay singh− modi hamaare liye koi mudda nahin hai
 Our fight is a battle of ideology
 hamaari ladaai unalogon se he jis vichaardhaara ne mahatma gandhi kii hatya karai thi jis vichaardhaara ne sampradayik sadbhaav ko bigaada jisane desh main alpsankhyak samudaay ko badnaam karne ke liye bam phode
 The Battle of Radical Ideology
 congress party aazaadee ke pehle se ladati ai he or aage bhi ladegi
 Manoranjan Bharti- You do not think that if you will counter Modi's point to point, then the truth is known immediately
 digvijay singh− desh ke rajyon ke jo indicaters hai chaahe human devlepment index ho chaahe par capita incum ho chaahe epadiai ho chaahe manuphaccharing sactor main investment ho chaahe implementation of anual yuj ho, ek bhi criteria main gujarat number van par nahin he
 If you look at the Human Development Index, Kerala is at number one where the Congress government is there
 par capita incum dekhenge to haryana number van par he jahaan congress kaa raaj he
 In the manufacturing sector and FDI, Maharashtra is at number one
 gujarat koun se stage par number van par he
 Maximum malnutrition is increasing there, the number of women is decreasing there
 jo growth rate he gujarat kaa wo hameshaa bharat ke growth rate se 2−4 zyada rahaa he
 Double digit growth has been in Gujarat even in the 90s
 iskaa shrey modi ko nahin jaataa he
 The credit goes to the industrialists of Gujarat
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki industrialist chaahate hai ki modi piem bane? Digvijay Singh - to whom he has given crores of land for free, to whom he has given the benefit of thousands of crores in tax, if he does not praise them, then whom will he do
 manoranjan bharti−aap 2014 kaa chunaav ladenge? If Digvijay Singh-party gives the ticket then he will definitely fight
 manoranjan bharti− matlab aap taiyaar hai? Digvijay Singh - will fight anywhere from here
 manoranjan bharti− 2014 main upi main aapaki siton kii sankhya jas kii tas rahegi
 Digvijay Singh - It cannot be said, but the preparations are complete and will fight the elections firmly
 manoranjan bharti− kya priyanka chunaav ladegi?tippaniyan Digvijay Singh - i have no idea
 manoranjan bharti− party main ek hi power centre hona chahie? Digvijay Singh- i have said my point and i am following what the official spokesperson has said
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki yadi mulaayam singh hatate bhi hai to congress ke paas paryaapt number rahegaa? Digvijay Singh - This is a big hypothetical question
 mulaayam singh ne yah bayaan diya he ki ham sarkaar nahin giraanaa chaahate
 Manoranjan Bharti - Why does Rahul seem to back down from leading? digvijay singh− wo siaiai ke anual general meeting ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 In this, he has given his views on the problems facing the country, what should be the vision to solve these problems
 congress kii mul dharna jo mahatma gandhi ke samay se rahi hai ki satta kaa vikendrikaran hona chahie or vikendrikrut satta hi samasyaon kaa nidaan kar sakati he
 In the Jaipur session, he said 'power is poison'
 isliye unki maa sonia ji ne kaha tha ki power kaa upyog dusron ko empower karne ke liye karnaa khud ke empower karne ke liye nahin karnaa
 This is a big deal
 yahi buniyadi antar he kangras or bhaajapa-sangh kii vichaardhaara main
 Manoranjan Bharati - The country wants to know how long Rahul will be ready to lead the country
 digvijay singh− aap log koun banegaa pradhanmantri isi par bahes karke apni tiarapy badhanaa chaahate hai
 We do not have a problem as to who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaari samasya yah he ki kaise ham log berogari dur karenge, kaise ham garibi dur karenge, kaise yahaan kaa kuposhan dur karenge, kaise yahaan ke human devlepment indax main sudhaar karenge, kaise growth rate ko badha paaenge, kaise ham ek acha vaataavaran nirmit kar paaenge, jisase naa keval epadiai aae, saath hi manuphaccharing sector main bhi ham zyada se zyada growth badha saken
 How can we employ people through skill development, which is a great achievement of the UPA government, how can we give employment to people through it, how we were given the right to information, right to education, right to work, now right We have given two feet
 manoranjan bharti− kahin yah kuch zyada thurytical to nahin he? Digvijay Singh - Absolutely not
 siem yaa piem kaa bhaashan nahin tha
 Vice President of Congress Party was the speech
 desh kaa har vyakti yah jaananaa chahta tha ki aakhir rahul gandhi brands he kya? bhaashan main rahul gandhi brands hi usamen vyakt kiya gaya
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will your party connect with 14 crore people under social media? digvijay singh− fikki mahila wing kaa kyrkram tha
 Those who are union directors are not married
 ab ye bhi ek bahut bada prashn he ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 In the form they fill in to contest elections, they also keep secret whether they are married or not
 pehali baat to yah he ki is desh kii janata or visheshkar mahila varg yah jaananaa chahta he ki modi ji aap ye spasht kar den ki aap shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The second thing is that they tell women that women should awaken the efforts of the people of the country

 We would like Modi to give a lot of speeches so that the people of the country will know how long they will listen to the rhetorical speech, why they do not talk about Yashoda Ben's pizza
 unase puuchhie ki yashoda ben koun hai? Manoranjan Bharati - meaning he was playing with emotions in this gathering digvijay singh− sangh prachaarak kaa bhaashan isi prakaar rata−rataya hota he
 The people of the Sangh are trained in such a way that just look at the road like a horse of a horse and do not look around

 Manoranjan Bharati - How will your people not be there? digvijay singh− hamaare log puure desh main hai or dhire−dhire hamaara jo penitrishan he bad rahaa he
 What was dominating the Sangh six months ago is no more today and after six months will see where they stand
 manoranjan bharti− aapako acha nahin laga hoga jab rahul gandhi ko pappu kaha gaya hoga
 Digvijay Singh- What was not told to Rahul Gandhiji, what was not told to Soniaji, should we get distracted by that, we do not get distracted
 narendra modi ji vichlit ho jate hai
 Do you remember when Karan Thapar asked him some questions, he went out
 kisi bhi ek congress netaa kaa naam bataaen jisane badasluki kii ho
 We know how to cope
 ye sangh ke log nahin jaanate
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think this social media can be unbridled? digvijay singh− vichaaron kii azaadi har prajatantr main hoti he
 We have a law for this and we should work within the scope of the law
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki shivaraj singh chouhan yah ishaara kar rahe hai ki modi ke samarthak bijepi ke samarthak nahin hai
 Digvijay Singh - i do not get into a fight with him
 manoranjan bharti− rahul banaam modi ko maanakar aap chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahe hai? Digvijay Singh- Modi is not an issue for us
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara kii ladaai he
 Our fight is against the people who killed Mahatma Gandhi, the ideology that ruined the communal harmony, which exploded bombs to discredit the minority community in the country
 kattarpanthi vichaardhaara kii ladaai
 The Congress party has been fighting since independence and will fight even further
 manoranjan bharti− aapako nahin lagata ki agar aap modi kii baton ko point tu point counter karenge to turant sachai pataa chalata he
 Digvijay Singh - Indicators of the states of the country, whether it is a Human Development Index, whether it is Capita Income, FDI, Investment in Manufacturing Sector or Implementation of Annual Use, Gujarat is not number one in any criterion
 agar aap human devlepment index dekhenge to kerala number van par he jahaan congress kii sarkaar he
 But if we look at the capita income, Haryana is at number one where the Congress is ruling
 manuphaccharing sactor or epadiai main dekhenge to maharashtra number van par he
 Gujarat is number one on which stage
 sabase zyada kuposhan vahiin bad rahaa he, sabase zyada mahilaon kii sankhya vahiin ghat rahi he
 Gujarat's growth rate has always been 2–4 more than India's growth rate
 dabl disit growth to gujarat main 90 ke dashak main bhi rahaa he
 The credit does not go to Modi
 iskaa shrey gujarat ke udyogpatiyon ko jaataa he
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think that industrialists want Modi to become PM? digvijay singh− jinako unhonen muft main karodon kii zamin di hai, jinako unhone tex main hazaron karod kaa faaydaa diya he wo unka gungan nahin karenge to kiskaa karenge
 Manoranjan Bharti – will you contest the 2014 election? digvijay singh−party tikat degi to jarur ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - Are you ready? digvijay singh− yahaan se kahin bhi ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharti - Your number of seats in UP will remain the same in 2014
 digvijay singh− yah nahin kaha ja saktaa, par taiyaari puri he or datakar chunaav ladenge
 Entertainment Bharti- Will Priyanka contest elections? Comments digvijay singh− mujhe koi bhi jaankaree nahin he
 Manoranjan bharati-party should have only one power center? digvijay singh− main apni baat kah chukaa hum or oficial spoxperson ne jo baat kahi he main uskaa paalan kar rahaa hum
 Digvijay Singh - This is a big hypothetical question

 Manoranjan Bharti - Why does Rahul seem to back down from leading? digvijay singh− wo siaiai ke anual general meeting ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 In this, he has given his views on the problems facing the country, what should be the vision to solve these problems
 congress kii mul dharna jo mahatma gandhi ke samay se rahi hai ki satta kaa vikendrikaran hona chahie or vikendrikrut satta hi samasyaon kaa nidaan kar sakati he
 In the Jaipur session, he said 'power is poison'
 isliye unki maa sonia ji ne kaha tha ki power kaa upyog dusron ko empower karne ke liye karnaa khud ke empower karne ke liye nahin karnaa
 This is a big deal

 Manoranjan Bharati - The country wants to know how long Rahul will be ready to lead the country
 digvijay singh− aap log koun banegaa pradhanmantri isi par bahes karke apni tiarapy badhanaa chaahate hai
 We do not have a problem as to who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaari samasya yah he ki kaise ham log berogari dur karenge, kaise ham garibi dur karenge, kaise yahaan kaa kuposhan dur karenge, kaise yahaan ke human devlepment indax main sudhaar karenge, kaise growth rate ko badha paaenge, kaise ham ek acha vaataavaran nirmit kar paaenge, jisase naa keval epadiai aae, saath hi manuphaccharing sector main bhi ham zyada se zyada growth badha saken
 How can we employ people through skill development, which is a great achievement of the UPA government, how can we give employment to people through it, how we were given the right to information, right to education, right to work, now right We have given two feet
 manoranjan bharti− kahin yah kuch zyada thurytical to nahin he? Digvijay Singh - Absolutely not
 siem yaa piem kaa bhaashan nahin tha
 Vice President of Congress Party was the speech
 desh kaa har vyakti yah jaananaa chahta tha ki aakhir rahul gandhi brands he kya? bhaashan main rahul gandhi brands hi usamen vyakt kiya gaya
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will your party connect with 14 crore people under social media? digvijay singh− fikki mahila wing kaa kyrkram tha
 Those who are union directors are not married
 ab ye bhi ek bahut bada prashn he ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 In the form they fill in to contest elections, they also keep secret whether they are married or not
 pehali baat to yah he ki is desh kii janata or visheshkar mahila varg yah jaananaa chahta he ki modi ji aap ye spasht kar den ki aap shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The second thing is that they tell women that women should awaken the efforts of the people of the country

 The number of women is decreasing with you
 iskaa matlab yahi he ki aapke yahaan kanya bhrun hatya kii ghatnaayen bad rahi hai iskaa uttar nahin dete hai or aap mahilaon se sangh prachaarak kii tarah bhaashan dete hai
 We would like Modi to give a lot of speeches so that the people of the country will know how long they will listen to the rhetorical speech, why they do not talk about Yashoda Ben's pizza
 unase puuchhie ki yashoda ben koun hai? Manoranjan Bharati - meaning he was playing with emotions in this gathering digvijay singh− sangh prachaarak kaa bhaashan isi prakaar rata−rataya hota he
 The people of the Sangh are trained in such a way that just look at the road like a horse of a horse and do not look around
 manoranjan bharti− kya modi ke bhaashan main sonia ji kii baat karnaa bul gaye? Digvijay Singh - If he wants to respect women, then accept Sushma Swaraj as the next Prime Minister

 Our fight is against the people who killed Mahatma Gandhi, the ideology that ruined the communal harmony, which exploded bombs to discredit the minority community in the country

 Digvijay Singh - Indicators of the states of the country, whether it is a Human Development Index, whether it is Capita Income, FDI, Investment in Manufacturing Sector or Implementation of Annual Use, Gujarat is not number one in any criterion

 Manoranjan bharati-party should have only one power center? digvijay singh− main apni baat kah chukaa hum or oficial spoxperson ne jo baat kahi he main uskaa paalan kar rahaa hum
 Digvijay Singh - He was addressing the Annual General Meeting of CII
 isamen desh ke saamne kya samasyaayein hai, in samasyaon ke nidaan ke liye kya vijan hona chahie, is par vistaar se unhone apni baat rakhi he
 The core belief of the Congress, which has been since Mahatma Gandhi's time, is that there should be decentralization of power and only decentralized power can solve the problems
 jaipur ke adhiveshan main unhone kaha tha 'power ij poijan'
 Therefore, his mother Soniaji had said that to use power to mpower others, not to do own mpower
 ye bahut badi baat he
 This is the basic difference between the ideology of Congress and bjp-sangh
 manoranjan bharti− desh jaananaa chahta he ki rahul kab tak desh kaa netritv karne ke liye taiyaar honge
 Digvijay Singh- You want to increase your TRP by arguing on who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaare saamne yah samasya nahin he ki koun banegaa pradhanmantri
 Our problem is that how will we remove unemployment, how will we eradicate poverty, how to eradicate malnutrition, how to improve the human development index, how to increase the growth rate, how we will be able to create a good environment
 , Which not only brings FDI, but also in the manufacturing sector, we can increase maximum growth
 kaise ham log skill devlepment ke sahare jo upie sarkaar kii bahut badi uplabdhi he, kaise ham uske madhyam se logon ko rojgaar de saken, kaise ham log jis tarah se rhite tu information diya, rhite tu ajukeshan diya, rhite tu work diya, ab rhite tu foot ham logon ne diya he
 Manoranjan Bharati - Is it anything more theatrical? digvijay singh− bilkul nahin
 There was no speech of CM or PM
 vaais president of congress party kaa bhaashan tha
 Everybody in the country wanted to know whether Rahul Gandhi is the brand? The Rahul Gandhi brand was expressed in the speech
 manoranjan bharti− soshal media ke tahat 14 karod logon se aapaki party kab judegi? Digvijay Singh - FICCI was the women's wing program
 sangh sanchaalak jo hote hai wo shaadi−shuda nahin hote hai
 Now this is also a very big question whether they are married or not
 ye chunaav ladane ke liye jo form bharte hai, usamen bhi gupt rakhte hai ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The first thing is that the people of this country and especially the women class want to know that Modi ji should make it clear whether you are married or not
 duusari baat yah he ki wo mahilaon ko kehete hai ki mahilaayein desh kaa ham logon kaa purusharth jaagrit karen
 This itself shows the Sangh's mindset
 ham mahila shakti ko badhanaa chaahate hai
 If anyone has contributed to increase women's power in this country, then it is the Congress
 rajeev gandhi ne mahilaon ko aarakshan diya
 As much as decisions have been taken in favor of women in the country, all Congress state governments and the central government have taken it
 bhaajapa ne kuch nahin kiya he
 i want to ask Modi that in the list of 35 states, your state is at number 32 in the ratio of male-female
 aap ke yahaan mahilaon kii sankhya ghat rahi he
 This means that the incidence of female feticide is increasing in your home and you do not answer it and you give speeches to women like Sangh Pracharak
 ham to chahenge ki modi khub bhaashan den taaki desh kii janata ko maaloom to pade ki rata−rataya bhaashan kitna din sunenge wo yashoda ben ke pizza kii baat kyon nahin karte
 Ask them who is Yashoda Ben? manoranjan bharti− matlab wo is sabha main bhaawanaaon se khel rahe the The speech of Digvijay singh-sangh Pracharak is like this
 sangh ke logon kii training is prakaar hoti he ki taange ke ghode kii tarah sirf sadak par dekho or aas−paas mat dekho
 Manoranjan Bharti - Did Modi's speech speak of Soniaji in Modi's speech? digvijay singh− agar wo mahilaon kii izzat karnaa chaahate hai to sushamaa swaraj ko agle pradhanmantri ke rup main sweekaar kar len
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will you reply to Modi on social media? digvijay singh− hamaara sangharsh kisi vyakti se nahin he
 Our fight is against ideology
 soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara he aaj mahatma gandhi ke murder ko jastiphai karti he
 Mahatma tells Gandhi's murder that healed
 kya iskaa ham log virodh naa karen
 Every citizen of the country, who is of the Liberal ideology, who is of the communal harmony ideology, we will continue to oppose the growing influence of the Sangh ideology on this social media
 manoranjan bharti− kaise karenge, aapke log to he nahin vahaan par
 Digvijay Singh - Our people are all over the country and gradually our penetration is increasing
 jo chah maheene pehle sangh kaa dabadabaa tha aaj wo nahin he or chah maheene baad dekhenge ki wo kahaan khadey hai
 Manoranjan Bharti- You might not have liked it when Rahul Gandhi was called Pappu
 digvijay singh− rahul gandhi ji ko kya−kya nahin kaha gaya, sonia ji ko kya nahin kaha gaya, kya ham usase vichlit ho jaaen humlog vichlit nahin hote
 Narendra Modi ji gets distracted
 aapako yaad he karan thapar ne jab unase kuch prashn puche to ve nikalakar baahar chale gaye
 Name any one Congress leader who has misbehaved
 ham saamana karnaa jaanate hai
 These Sangh people do not know
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki ye soshal media belgaum ho saktaa he? Digvijay Singh - Freedom of thought exists in every democracy
 hamaare yahaan iske liye kanoon bana hua he or kanoon ke daayre main rahakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Manoranjan Bharti- You think that Shivraj Singh Chauhan is pointing out that Modi's supporters are not bjp's supporters
 digvijay singh− mujhe unke jhagade main nahin padana
 Recreation Bharti- Are you preparing for the election by assuming Rahul vs Modi? digvijay singh− modi hamaare liye koi mudda nahin hai
 Our fight is a battle of ideology
 hamaari ladaai unalogon se he jis vichaardhaara ne mahatma gandhi kii hatya karai thi jis vichaardhaara ne sampradayik sadbhaav ko bigaada jisane desh main alpsankhyak samudaay ko badnaam karne ke liye bam phode
 The Battle of Radical Ideology
 congress party aazaadee ke pehle se ladati ai he or aage bhi ladegi
 Manoranjan Bharti- You do not think that if you will counter Modi's point to point, then the truth is known immediately
 digvijay singh− desh ke rajyon ke jo indicaters hai chaahe human devlepment index ho chaahe par capita incum ho chaahe epadiai ho chaahe manuphaccharing sactor main investment ho chaahe implementation of anual yuj ho, ek bhi criteria main gujarat number van par nahin he
 If you look at the Human Development Index, Kerala is at number one where the Congress government is there
 par capita incum dekhenge to haryana number van par he jahaan congress kaa raaj he
 In the manufacturing sector and FDI, Maharashtra is at number one
 gujarat koun se stage par number van par he
 Maximum malnutrition is increasing there, the number of women is decreasing there
 jo growth rate he gujarat kaa wo hameshaa bharat ke growth rate se 2−4 zyada rahaa he
 Double digit growth has been in Gujarat even in the 90s
 iskaa shrey modi ko nahin jaataa he
 The credit goes to the industrialists of Gujarat
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki industrialist chaahate hai ki modi piem bane? Digvijay Singh - to whom he has given crores of land for free, to whom he has given the benefit of thousands of crores in tax, if he does not praise them, then whom will he do
 manoranjan bharti−aap 2014 kaa chunaav ladenge? If Digvijay Singh-party gives the ticket then he will definitely fight
 manoranjan bharti− matlab aap taiyaar hai? Digvijay Singh - will fight anywhere from here
 manoranjan bharti− 2014 main upi main aapaki siton kii sankhya jas kii tas rahegi
 Digvijay Singh - It cannot be said, but the preparations are complete and will fight the elections firmly
 manoranjan bharti− kya priyanka chunaav ladegi?tippaniyan Digvijay Singh - i have no idea
 manoranjan bharti− party main ek hi power centre hona chahie? Digvijay Singh- i have said my point and i am following what the official spokesperson has said
 manoranjan bharti− desh jaananaa chahta he ki rahul kab tak desh kaa netritv karne ke liye taiyaar honge

 hamaare yahaan iske liye kanoon bana hua he or kanoon ke daayre main rahakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Manoranjan Bharti- You think that Shivraj Singh Chauhan is pointing out that Modi's supporters are not bjp's supporters
 digvijay singh− mujhe unke jhagade main nahin padana
 Recreation Bharti- Are you preparing for the election by assuming Rahul vs Modi? digvijay singh− modi hamaare liye koi mudda nahin hai
 Our fight is a battle of ideology
 hamaari ladaai unalogon se he jis vichaardhaara ne mahatma gandhi kii hatya karai thi jis vichaardhaara ne sampradayik sadbhaav ko bigaada jisane desh main alpsankhyak samudaay ko badnaam karne ke liye bam phode
 The Battle of Radical Ideology
 congress party aazaadee ke pehle se ladati ai he or aage bhi ladegi
 Manoranjan Bharti- You do not think that if you will counter Modi's point to point, then the truth is known immediately
 digvijay singh− desh ke rajyon ke jo indicaters hai chaahe human devlepment index ho chaahe par capita incum ho chaahe epadiai ho chaahe manuphaccharing sactor main investment ho chaahe implementation of anual yuj ho, ek bhi criteria main gujarat number van par nahin he
 If you look at the Human Development Index, Kerala is at number one where the Congress government is there
 par capita incum dekhenge to haryana number van par he jahaan congress kaa raaj he
 In the manufacturing sector and FDI, Maharashtra is at number one
 gujarat koun se stage par number van par he
 Maximum malnutrition is increasing there, the number of women is decreasing there
 jo growth rate he gujarat kaa wo hameshaa bharat ke growth rate se 2−4 zyada rahaa he
 Double digit growth has been in Gujarat even in the 90s
 iskaa shrey modi ko nahin jaataa he
 The credit goes to the industrialists of Gujarat
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki industrialist chaahate hai ki modi piem bane? Digvijay Singh - to whom he has given crores of land for free, to whom he has given the benefit of thousands of crores in tax, if he does not praise them, then whom will he do
 manoranjan bharti−aap 2014 kaa chunaav ladenge? If Digvijay Singh-party gives the ticket then he will definitely fight
 manoranjan bharti− matlab aap taiyaar hai? Digvijay Singh - will fight anywhere from here
 manoranjan bharti− 2014 main upi main aapaki siton kii sankhya jas kii tas rahegi
 Digvijay Singh - It cannot be said, but the preparations are complete and will fight the elections firmly
 manoranjan bharti− kya priyanka chunaav ladegi?tippaniyan Digvijay Singh - i have no idea
 manoranjan bharti− party main ek hi power centre hona chahie? Digvijay Singh- i have said my point and i am following what the official spokesperson has said
 digvijay singh− aap log koun banegaa pradhanmantri isi par bahes karke apni tiarapy badhanaa chaahate hai
 We do not have a problem as to who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaari samasya yah he ki kaise ham log berogari dur karenge, kaise ham garibi dur karenge, kaise yahaan kaa kuposhan dur karenge, kaise yahaan ke human devlepment indax main sudhaar karenge, kaise growth rate ko badha paaenge, kaise ham ek acha vaataavaran nirmit kar paaenge, jisase naa keval epadiai aae, saath hi manuphaccharing sector main bhi ham zyada se zyada growth badha saken
 How can we employ people through skill development, which is a great achievement of the UPA government, how can we give employment to people through it, how we were given the right to information, right to education, right to work, now right We have given two feet
 manoranjan bharti− kahin yah kuch zyada thurytical to nahin he? Digvijay Singh - Absolutely not
 siem yaa piem kaa bhaashan nahin tha
 Vice President of Congress Party was the speech
 desh kaa har vyakti yah jaananaa chahta tha ki aakhir rahul gandhi brands he kya? bhaashan main rahul gandhi brands hi usamen vyakt kiya gaya
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will your party connect with 14 crore people under social media? digvijay singh− fikki mahila wing kaa kyrkram tha
 Those who are union directors are not married
 ab ye bhi ek bahut bada prashn he ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 In the form they fill in to contest elections, they also keep secret whether they are married or not
 pehali baat to yah he ki is desh kii janata or visheshkar mahila varg yah jaananaa chahta he ki modi ji aap ye spasht kar den ki aap shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The second thing is that they tell women that women should awaken the efforts of the people of the country
 yahi apane aap main sangh kii maansikta ko jaahir karata he
 We want to increase female power
 is desh main mahila shakti badhaane main kisi kaa yogadan rahaa he to congress kaa he
 Rajiv Gandhi gave reservation to women
 jitna bhi desh main mahilaon ke paksh main nirnay hue hai sabhi congress ke rajya sarkaron or centre sarkaar ne liya he
 BJP has done nothing
 main poochna chahta hum modi se ki 35 rajyon kii list main aapke rajya main mail−femail ke anupaat main 32wein number par he
 The number of women is decreasing with you
 iskaa matlab yahi he ki aapke yahaan kanya bhrun hatya kii ghatnaayen bad rahi hai iskaa uttar nahin dete hai or aap mahilaon se sangh prachaarak kii tarah bhaashan dete hai
 We would like Modi to give a lot of speeches so that the people of the country will know how long they will listen to the rhetorical speech, why they do not talk about Yashoda Ben's pizza
 unase puuchhie ki yashoda ben koun hai? Manoranjan Bharati - meaning he was playing with emotions in this gathering digvijay singh− sangh prachaarak kaa bhaashan isi prakaar rata−rataya hota he
 The people of the Sangh are trained in such a way that just look at the road like a horse of a horse and do not look around
 manoranjan bharti− kya modi ke bhaashan main sonia ji kii baat karnaa bul gaye? Digvijay Singh - If he wants to respect women, then accept Sushma Swaraj as the next Prime Minister
 manoranjan bharti− aap soshal media par modi ko kab jawaab denge? Digvijay Singh - Our struggle is not with any person
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara se he
 Today, the ideology of the Sangh on social media justifies Mahatma Gandhi's murder
 mahatma gandhi ke murder ko kahati he ki thik hua
 Should we not oppose it? desh kaa har naagarik jo libral vichaardhaara kaa he jo sampradayik sadbhaav vichaardhaara kaa he, is soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara kaa prabhaav badhata ja rahaa he uskaa ham nirantar virodh karenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - How will your people not be there? digvijay singh− hamaare log puure desh main hai or dhire−dhire hamaara jo penitrishan he bad rahaa he
 What was dominating the Sangh six months ago is no more today and after six months will see where they stand
 manoranjan bharti− aapako acha nahin laga hoga jab rahul gandhi ko pappu kaha gaya hoga
 Digvijay Singh- What was not told to Rahul Gandhiji, what was not told to Soniaji, should we get distracted by that, we do not get distracted
 narendra modi ji vichlit ho jate hai
 Do you remember when Karan Thapar asked him some questions, he went out
 kisi bhi ek congress netaa kaa naam bataaen jisane badasluki kii ho
 We know how to cope
 ye sangh ke log nahin jaanate
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think this social media can be unbridled? digvijay singh− vichaaron kii azaadi har prajatantr main hoti he
 We have a law for this and we should work within the scope of the law
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki shivaraj singh chouhan yah ishaara kar rahe hai ki modi ke samarthak bijepi ke samarthak nahin hai
 Digvijay Singh - i do not get into a fight with him
 manoranjan bharti− rahul banaam modi ko maanakar aap chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahe hai? Digvijay Singh- Modi is not an issue for us
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara kii ladaai he
 Our fight is against the people who killed Mahatma Gandhi, the ideology that ruined the communal harmony, which exploded bombs to discredit the minority community in the country
 kattarpanthi vichaardhaara kii ladaai
 The Congress party has been fighting since independence and will fight even further
 manoranjan bharti− aapako nahin lagata ki agar aap modi kii baton ko point tu point counter karenge to turant sachai pataa chalata he
 Digvijay Singh - Indicators of the states of the country, whether it is a Human Development Index, whether it is Capita Income, FDI, Investment in Manufacturing Sector or Implementation of Annual Use, Gujarat is not number one in any criterion
 agar aap human devlepment index dekhenge to kerala number van par he jahaan congress kii sarkaar he
 But if we look at the capita income, Haryana is at number one where the Congress is ruling
 manuphaccharing sactor or epadiai main dekhenge to maharashtra number van par he
 Gujarat is number one on which stage
 sabase zyada kuposhan vahiin bad rahaa he, sabase zyada mahilaon kii sankhya vahiin ghat rahi he
 Gujarat's growth rate has always been 2–4 more than India's growth rate
 dabl disit growth to gujarat main 90 ke dashak main bhi rahaa he
 The credit does not go to Modi
 iskaa shrey gujarat ke udyogpatiyon ko jaataa he
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think that industrialists want Modi to become PM? digvijay singh− jinako unhonen muft main karodon kii zamin di hai, jinako unhone tex main hazaron karod kaa faaydaa diya he wo unka gungan nahin karenge to kiskaa karenge
 Manoranjan Bharti – will you contest the 2014 election? digvijay singh−party tikat degi to jarur ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - Are you ready? digvijay singh− yahaan se kahin bhi ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharti - Your number of seats in UP will remain the same in 2014
 digvijay singh− yah nahin kaha ja saktaa, par taiyaari puri he or datakar chunaav ladenge
 Entertainment Bharti- Will Priyanka contest elections? Comments digvijay singh− mujhe koi bhi jaankaree nahin he
 Manoranjan bharati-party should have only one power center? digvijay singh− main apni baat kah chukaa hum or oficial spoxperson ne jo baat kahi he main uskaa paalan kar rahaa hum
 Manoranjan Bharati - Is it anything more theatrical? digvijay singh− bilkul nahin
 There was no speech of CM or PM
 vaais president of congress party kaa bhaashan tha
 Everybody in the country wanted to know whether Rahul Gandhi is the brand? The Rahul Gandhi brand was expressed in the speech
 manoranjan bharti− soshal media ke tahat 14 karod logon se aapaki party kab judegi? Digvijay Singh - FICCI was the women's wing program
 sangh sanchaalak jo hote hai wo shaadi−shuda nahin hote hai
 Now this is also a very big question whether they are married or not
 ye chunaav ladane ke liye jo form bharte hai, usamen bhi gupt rakhte hai ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The first thing is that the people of this country and especially the women class want to know that Modi ji should make it clear whether you are married or not
 duusari baat yah he ki wo mahilaon ko kehete hai ki mahilaayein desh kaa ham logon kaa purusharth jaagrit karen
 This itself shows the Sangh's mindset
 ham mahila shakti ko badhanaa chaahate hai
 If anyone has contributed to increase women's power in this country, then it is the Congress
 rajeev gandhi ne mahilaon ko aarakshan diya
 As much as decisions have been taken in favor of women in the country, all Congress state governments and the central government have taken it
 bhaajapa ne kuch nahin kiya he
 i want to ask Modi that in the list of 35 states, your state is at number 32 in the ratio of male-female
 aap ke yahaan mahilaon kii sankhya ghat rahi he
 This means that the incidence of female feticide is increasing in your home and you do not answer it and you give speeches to women like Sangh Pracharak
 ham to chahenge ki modi khub bhaashan den taaki desh kii janata ko maaloom to pade ki rata−rataya bhaashan kitna din sunenge wo yashoda ben ke pizza kii baat kyon nahin karte
 Ask them who is Yashoda Ben? manoranjan bharti− matlab wo is sabha main bhaawanaaon se khel rahe the The speech of Digvijay singh-sangh Pracharak is like this
 sangh ke logon kii training is prakaar hoti he ki taange ke ghode kii tarah sirf sadak par dekho or aas−paas mat dekho
 Manoranjan Bharti - Did Modi's speech speak of Soniaji in Modi's speech? digvijay singh− agar wo mahilaon kii izzat karnaa chaahate hai to sushamaa swaraj ko agle pradhanmantri ke rup main sweekaar kar len
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will you reply to Modi on social media? digvijay singh− hamaara sangharsh kisi vyakti se nahin he
 Our fight is against ideology
 soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara he aaj mahatma gandhi ke murder ko jastiphai karti he
 Mahatma tells Gandhi's murder that healed
 kya iskaa ham log virodh naa karen
 Every citizen of the country, who is of the Liberal ideology, who is of the communal harmony ideology, we will continue to oppose the growing influence of the Sangh ideology on this social media
 manoranjan bharti− kaise karenge, aapke log to he nahin vahaan par
 Digvijay Singh - Our people are all over the country and gradually our penetration is increasing
 jo chah maheene pehle sangh kaa dabadabaa tha aaj wo nahin he or chah maheene baad dekhenge ki wo kahaan khadey hai
 Manoranjan Bharti- You might not have liked it when Rahul Gandhi was called Pappu
 digvijay singh− rahul gandhi ji ko kya−kya nahin kaha gaya, sonia ji ko kya nahin kaha gaya, kya ham usase vichlit ho jaaen humlog vichlit nahin hote
 Narendra Modi ji gets distracted
 aapako yaad he karan thapar ne jab unase kuch prashn puche to ve nikalakar baahar chale gaye
 Name any one Congress leader who has misbehaved
 ham saamana karnaa jaanate hai
 These Sangh people do not know
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki ye soshal media belgaum ho saktaa he? Digvijay Singh - Freedom of thought exists in every democracy
 hamaare yahaan iske liye kanoon bana hua he or kanoon ke daayre main rahakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Manoranjan Bharti- You think that Shivraj Singh Chauhan is pointing out that Modi's supporters are not bjp's supporters

 The Battle of Radical Ideology

 Our fight is against ideology
 soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara he aaj mahatma gandhi ke murder ko jastiphai karti he
 Mahatma tells Gandhi's murder that healed
 kya iskaa ham log virodh naa karen
 Every citizen of the country, who is of the Liberal ideology, who is of the communal harmony ideology, we will continue to oppose the growing influence of the Sangh ideology on this social media
 manoranjan bharti− kaise karenge, aapke log to he nahin vahaan par

 Name any one Congress leader who has misbehaved

 These Sangh people do not know
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki ye soshal media belgaum ho saktaa he? Digvijay Singh - Freedom of thought exists in every democracy
 hamaare yahaan iske liye kanoon bana hua he or kanoon ke daayre main rahakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Manoranjan Bharti- You think that Shivraj Singh Chauhan is pointing out that Modi's supporters are not bjp's supporters
 digvijay singh− mujhe unke jhagade main nahin padana
 Recreation Bharti- Are you preparing for the election by assuming Rahul vs Modi? digvijay singh− modi hamaare liye koi mudda nahin hai
 Our fight is a battle of ideology
 hamaari ladaai unalogon se he jis vichaardhaara ne mahatma gandhi kii hatya karai thi jis vichaardhaara ne sampradayik sadbhaav ko bigaada jisane desh main alpsankhyak samudaay ko badnaam karne ke liye bam phode
 The Battle of Radical Ideology
 congress party aazaadee ke pehle se ladati ai he or aage bhi ladegi
 Manoranjan Bharti- You do not think that if you will counter Modi's point to point, then the truth is known immediately
 digvijay singh− desh ke rajyon ke jo indicaters hai chaahe human devlepment index ho chaahe par capita incum ho chaahe epadiai ho chaahe manuphaccharing sactor main investment ho chaahe implementation of anual yuj ho, ek bhi criteria main gujarat number van par nahin he
 If you look at the Human Development Index, Kerala is at number one where the Congress government is there
 par capita incum dekhenge to haryana number van par he jahaan congress kaa raaj he
 In the manufacturing sector and FDI, Maharashtra is at number one
 gujarat koun se stage par number van par he
 Maximum malnutrition is increasing there, the number of women is decreasing there
 jo growth rate he gujarat kaa wo hameshaa bharat ke growth rate se 2−4 zyada rahaa he
 Double digit growth has been in Gujarat even in the 90s
 iskaa shrey modi ko nahin jaataa he
 The credit goes to the industrialists of Gujarat
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki industrialist chaahate hai ki modi piem bane? Digvijay Singh - to whom he has given crores of land for free, to whom he has given the benefit of thousands of crores in tax, if he does not praise them, then whom will he do

 ) Before the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the nature of the grand alliance in Bihar has been decided
 jabaki siton ke lihaaj se hindi pattee ke sabase bade rajya uttar pradesh main do bade vipakshi dal samaajawaadee party (espi) or bahujan samaaj party (bispi) main gathbandhan kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 Given the unsuccessful success of the SP-BSP alliance in the Lok Sabha and Assembly by-elections held in UP recently, it is believed that the two political parties will contest the general elections together
 lekin yahaan dhyaan dene vaali baat yah bhi he ki bispi aamtaur par upachunaav nahin ladati
 Hence, the alliance for the BSP was not a big deal in the by-elections
 paanch rajyon main haal main sampann hue vidhansabha chunaav ke baad ab sabhi siyaasi dalon ne aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaari shuru kar di he
 But all eyes are set on Uttar Pradesh, where SP and BSP are ready to contest elections together
 haalanki, yah itnaa aasaan nahin hoga kyonki bispi supremeo mayawati ko molbhav ke maamle main bahut kadaa mana jaataa he
 At present, the BSP does not have a single MP in the Lok Sabha
 jabaki haal main hue gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa upachunaav ko milakar espi ke 7 saansad hai
 The BSP, which was in second place on 34 seats, SP on 31, usually the formula that is decided on the alliance, is the seat that is occupied by the person
 phir dekha jaataa he ki pichley chunaav main kis seat par us raajnneetik dal kaa ummidavaar duusare sthaan par tha
 In this context, if the 2014 general elections are made on the basis, the BSP was second on 34 seats and Samajwadi Party was second on 31 seats
 vahiin 80 loksabhaa siton main baaki kii bachi siton ko vot pratishat ke aadhaar par baanta ja saktaa he
 But in the SP-BSP alliance, the real screw can get stuck in Muslim majority seats
 maaya ne 100 muslimon ko diya tha vidhasabha kaa tiktyadav-muslim sameekaran ko apana aadhaar maanane vaali samaajawaadee party apana alpsankhyak aadhaar khona nahin chaahegi
 At the same time, Bahujan Samaj Party has been continuously trying to bring minorities into its camp
 isi uddeshy se saal 2017 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bispi ne 100 siton par muslim ummidavaaron ko tikat diya tha
 While the SP contested in alliance with Congress
 aise main espi or bispi ke ummidavaaron main voton kaa bikharaav ho gaya jiskaa phayda bijepi ko hua
 These are special Muslim dominated seats in terms of Muslim population, Rampur, Moradabad, Saharanpur, Bijnor and Amroha are such Lok Sabha seats where Muslim population is between 35 to 50 percent
 vahiin meerut, kairana, bareli, mujffarnagar, sanbhal, dumriyaganj, baharich, kaisarganj, lakhanu, shahjahanpur or barabanki main muslim aabaadi 20 fisadi se zyada or 35 fisadi se kam he
 In recent times, Bahujan Samaj Party has increased its minority base in western Uttar Pradesh
 lihaaja, yahi wo siten hai jinhen lekar pech funs saktaa he
 After this, it will come to those seats where both SP and BSP did not finish second
 aisi sthiti main jaateey sameekaran myne rakhenge or jatiyon ko lekar jin siton par jinka palada baari rahegaa unhen ve site milengi
 But looking at the experience of the Legislative Assembly of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, the BSP supremo Mayawati had unilaterally decided not to tie up with the Congress at the bottom of some seats

 india today conklev ke ek ahm satr main 'sepions: a brif history of human kind' ke lekhak yuvaal noh haraari ne shirkat kii
 Historian Harari spoke on globalization and history during his speech
 is dauraan unhone ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki duniya main do prakaar ke bhagwaan hai
 One about whom we do not know anything and the other about whom we know everything
 darasal, haraari se sawaal poocha gaya ki kya aap bhagwaan main vishwaas karte hai to unhone kaha ki main bhagwaan main vishwaas nahin karata
 At the same time, stopping his first point, he told that there are two types of God in the world
 ek wo jo adrishy hai, jinke bare main ham kuch nahin jaanate, jo ki rahasyamayi hai
 Whenever people do not get the answer to a question, then people remember this God and say that this God must have done or created it
 is bhagwaan ko na to kabhi dekha gaya or na hi kabhi suna gaya
 i believe in this god
 vahiin, duusare prakaar ke bhagwaan iske bilkul vipareet hai, jiske bare main ham sabhi ko sab kuch pataa he
 We know about him what he has done for women's fashion, what he has done for human sexuality
 ye wo bhagwaan hai jo hamen bataate hai ki hamen kis netaa ko vot dena he
 Those who have magic, they say that one man can have a relationship with two women
 lekhak haraari kehete hai ki ye behad khatarnaak prakaar ke bhagwaan hai
 Which i do not believe
 unhone duusare prakaar ke bhagwaan par kataaksh karte hue kaha ki agar koi adrishy shakti he jisane is brahmad kii rachana kii, sansar kii rachana kii, maanav ko banaaya, blike hole ke liye uttaradaayi he, jisane sundar jivan diya
 It would hardly mean what the dress code of women should be
 'chaar se paanch hajaar saal pehle pehali baar aayaa rashtrawaad'haraari ne kaha ki bhavishya vartmaan se bahut alag hoga or vaishvik samasyaon ko samaadhaanon kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Describing the history of nationalism, Harari said that 4,000-5,000 years ago nationalism first came to the banks of the river
 us samay nadiyon or prakruti ke prakope se bachane ke liye chote samooh ek saath milakar kaam karte the
 Together they built canals and dams
 milakar anaaj ugaae
 He said that the kind of nationalism that has come back in recent times is a matter of concern and it is not in any remote corner of the world but in North America, Europe and India
 yah ek chintaa he kyonki rashtrawaad samaadhaan pradaan karne main sakasham nahin hoga, jiskaa saamana bhavishya main duniya karegi
 Harari said on Ramayana - The truth cannot be accepted as a fact is true when the writer Harari was asked if you have a history of conflict and controversy like India? In response to this, he said that tampering with history is not only India but a global problem
 unhone kaha ki itihaas ek puranic katha he
 Harari said that i do not say that all religious books are right, for this we have to differentiate between fiction and truth
 ramayana kii sachai ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki agar aapke paas saboot hai to mujhe us par vishwaas karnaa hoga
 At the same time, if you do not have any evidence about an incident, then i cannot believe it
 is par unase poocha gaya ki google dwaara bharat or srilanka ke bich sthit ram sethu kii tasviir dikhaai gai he, to phir kya ramayana kii kahani sach he
 In response to this, he said that due to the truth of one aspect of a story, the whole story cannot be true
 takneekee vinaash sabase badi chunauteeharaari ne duniya ke saamne khadi chunautiyon kii baat karte hue kaha ki aaj ke samay main duniya ke saamne sabase badi chunauti takneekee vinaash kii he
 At the same time, he said that today there are millions of people whose economic value is zero, which is very dangerous for the world
 haalanki, ab sarkarein yojanaayen bana rahi hai, jisase logon ko rojgaar mil rahaa he
 But there are many discrepancies in the world about the salary paid in lieu of employment
 unhone kaha ki duniya kaa zyaadaatar hissaa sasti mazdooree par tikaa he
 Which can be destroyed at any time
 ise samajhane ke liye aap bangladesh or america main mazdooree ke badale milane vaale vetan kii tulana kar sakate hai
 Actually, in the present times, there is very little and very high wages
 isse kamjor or garib desh or garib ho rahe hai va amir or amir
 Speaking on global politics, Harari said that rules should also be global in the world
 udhaaharan dekar unhone samajhane kii koshish kii or kaha ki aaj ke samay main agar america hathiyaar banane par pabandi lagaataa he yaa hathiyaar bananaa band kar detaa he to duusare desh jaise rus or china us hathiyaar ke utpaadan ko badha dete hai
 This America is also forced to reverse its decision and start producing destructive weapons
 aise maahaul main koi desh un deshon ko is baat ke liye taiyaar nahin karata ki wo bhi is niyam ko maane jisase duniya kaa bhala hoga
 Countries do not know what is the problem in front of the world
 Harri said that we are living in the 21st century, but still the nations do not know what is the major problem before them
 unhone kaha ki samasyaon ko samajhane ke liye vaishvik raajnneeti kaa hona jaruri he
 Harari said that after 1945 there was a change, that there was no war between any two big countries
 lekin vaishvik samasya ko samajhane ke liye hamen raashtra or dharm se upar uthakar sochna hoga
 Just like after the controversies on religious issues, we study each aspect in depth and answer questions
 hararine kaha ki ab yuddh nahin hote
 This change has come from the global changes in people's thinking and their decisions
 bade vaishvik badlaav ke liye vaishvik str par budhimatta kii jarurat hoti he
 If we start teaching about mankind in schools and talk about problems, then children will focus on it and will be able to reach it

 The Reserve Bank of India is preparing to link the base rate to the MCLR from 1 April
 arabiai ne yah faisla un shikayaton ke baad liya he, jisamen bataaya gaya tha ki bank byaaj daron main hone vaali katautee kaa phayda graahakon ko nahin de rahe
 The Reserve Bank of India introduced the system of Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rates (MCLR) on April 1, 2016 last year
 iske liye usne bainkon ko base rate se nikalakar emsielaar kii taraf badhane ke liye kaha tha, lekin bainkon ne isamen zyada ruchi nahin dikhaai
 Only after this, the RBI has decided to link the base rate with the MCLR
 kya he base rate?base rate bhartiya rigerv bank dwaara tay kiya jaataa he
 This is the rate below which no bank can give a loan to its customer
 is vyavastha ko isliye laayaa gaya tha ki credit market main paardarshita laai jaae
 What is the drawback? Most banks provide bank loans to their customers only under the base rate
 is vyavastha kii khami yah thi ki bank byaaj daron main jaldi badlaav nahin karte hai
 Even after the central bank has cut interest rates, banks do not give benefit of this to quick customers
 byaaj daron main katautee kaa phayda dhire-dhire graahakon tak pahunchaate hai
 Due to this, customers do not get full benefit of it
 kya he MCLR rate?bhartiya rigerv bank ne pichley saal 1 april ko marginal cost of funds besd lending rates (MCLR) kii vyavastha shuru kii he
 Under this arrangement, the loan interest rates for individual customers are decided on the basis of their risk profile
 kaise tay hota he MCLR rate?marginal kaa matlab hota he- alag se athwa atirikt
 Whenever banks decide the lending rate, they also calculate the cost of the changed position and the marginal cost
 bainkon ke str par graahakon ko diposit par die jane vaali byaaj dar shaamil hoti he
 4 factors are taken into account to decide the MCLR
 isamen- fund kaa atirikt charge- negative kairi on crr-oparation cost- tener premiumapako hoga ye phaaydabese rate ke emsielaar se judane kaa phayda yah hoga ki bhartiya rigerv bank kii taraf se jab bhi byaaj daron main katautee kii jaaegi, uskaa turant phayda graahakon tak pahunchane main aasaani hogi
 With this, you will get the benefit of interest rate reduction in your EMI soon
 kya he cash rigerv reshio (crr)cash rigerv reshio vah reshio hota he, jiske aadhaar par bainkon ko kuch paise arabiai ke paas jamaa rakhane padate hai
 You are affected by this
 Whenever the cash reserve ratio increases, banks give less loans
 darasal siaraar badhane se unhen arabiai ke paas zyada paise rigerv main rakhane padate hai
 This gives banks less credit and increases lending rates
 vahiin, jab bhi siaraar main katautee kii jaati he, to bainkon par zyada karj dene kaa dabaav banataa he

 unke bayaan se lagata he ki in ghatnaon se wo behad dukhi hai
 He further said, 'as a human being, animals are moving around and you are watching the condition of society, i cannot say, but because you are the leader of the society, you are a youth, the whole country is looking at you
 And especially to the students of Bihar, which was the biggest change in the country, it was through you, then a big change, you change education in Bihar together
 'unhone kaha ki kisi visi ke yahaan jaakar mej par mukka maarane kii zarurat nahin he, samajhakar, bujhaakar aapaki jo maange hon, jo jo aap chaahate hai mil baithkar sulajhaakar sakaaratmak tareeke se aap samaadhaan nikaal sakate hai
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi said that leadership does not only mean becoming MP-MLA but leadership should be in every sphere of society
 modi ne bihar main shiksha ke sudhaar ke liye sarkaar dwaara uthaae gaye kadam ke bare mar chaatro ko bataaya
 Sushil Modi made a special review of preparations for the International Yoga Day on 21 June in Patna and appealed to the common people to participate in the Yoga Day in greater numbers
 patna ke patliputra indor stadium, kankarbagh main yoga diwas ke mukhya kaarykram ke aayojan main shaamil hone kii sahmati rajyapal satyapal malik ne di he
 He issued a statement that in the meeting, it was decided to make contact with high schools, colleges, coaching institutes as well as social and cultural organizations in the capital to make more people participate in the Yoga Day program
 ensisi cadats, art of living va yoga ke kshetra main kaam kar rahi anya sansthaaon se bhi sampark kar unhen aayojan main shaamil karne kaa prayaas kiya jayega
 But the important thing is that this time Yoga Day is attended by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar or not because this will be the first time in Bihar when Yoga Day is being celebrated in the BJP and Janata dal-u government
 pichley saal tak mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar thi tab bihar main keval bijepi hi yoga diwas manaati thi
 This time it will be interesting to see if the Janata Dal u in the government, along with the BGP, participates on this Yoga Day
 vaise to nitish kumaar roj subah yoga karte he lekin yoga diwas manaane kaa elaan hua he us samaaroh se wo hameshaa dur hi rahe hai

 Everyone has a conversion opener, 'how long will it last?' Papa's 'sit here and talk!' Girlfriend's 'kya Kalla Ae Mela Babu?' And friends' brother! Seeing you was laughing 'in the same way relatives have a conversion opener' and how was the result? ' If there is no excuse for asking the result, then half the relatives should never talk to us, after all, how many times is that 'all is going well!' Would like to ask riglts to aate hi isiilie hai taaki ek din rishtedaar puch saken or bachche bhi saal ke das maheene kitabon main munh die rahete hai taaki rigelt ke din rishtedaaron se munh chupaana na pad jaae
 If you sit leisurely every day, you will find that the amount of 'relative' and 'result' is also one

 In such a situation, the relatives were given the right to choose for themselves, to set a day for themselves and chose the day of their birth
 wo din he or aaj kaa din riglts aate hai or uske baad rishtedaar, riglts agar kharaab aa jaaen to ghabraana nahin chahie, kharaab rigelt aana sabase bura nahin hota or ye tab mahasoos hota he jab paanch minute baad rishtedaaron ke phone aane shuru hote hai

 bhadohi vaali buaa kii jo nanad saalon se aapke barhon main khud ke bete ko baba suut na milane par naaraaz hokar baithi thi wo tapati dopaher main rigelt poochne ghar par aa dhamakati he
 Jethani's daughter-in-law of Amarkantak's aunt, who once blocked whatsapp's number on Facebook, asks for it
 wo landline par phone kar rigelt jaananaa chaahati he
 On the day of the result, landline phones also feel like Doordarshan on 26 January
 galati board waalon kii he, unhen rigelt net par nahi daalana chahie do din pehle saare rishtedaaron ke ghar bhej dena chahie
 The power to spread talk among relatives is very fast
 hamen bhi pataa chalaa jayega
 Life is shrinking, people are having less time
 milane or baat karne kaa vaqt nahin miltaa aise main riglts hamen paas laate hai
 Feels like a festival, then it is the Mahaparva of relatives
 rigelt acha aa jaae to chhene ke rasagulle kaa shira kameez par tapakane se bachaate rishtedaar bhale lagate hai
 At the same time, the same relative enemies start appearing if the results go wrong
 bigadaa rigelt rishtedaaron ko mauka detaa he, kamiyaan nikaalane kaa
 Six months ago, at the Sirmour crossroads, you have seen immortal accounts of Chiniabadam and Bihari, they also associate it with bad results
 chalate-chalate gurjar aarakshan ke liye patariyaan ukhaad rahe hai, aise main kal sibiesai kaa rigelt aayaa, ladkiyaan phir baaji maar gayi

 While waving the pallu on Rajesh's left hand, it was known that which part of the sari would look where and how
 main duusari mez par saadiyon ke bich apni naapsandgi se guzar rahaa tha tabhi meri nazar rajesh par padi
 Left the saris there and took out the phone from the bag and asked for permission to take the picture
 jo mahila mujhe sari dikhaa rahi thim wo bhi chaahatin to rajesh kii tarah saadiyon ko baandhakar meri shankaaon ko dur kar sakati thim, lekin wo chook gayi
 Just made sure to ask Rajesh for my picture
 rajesh ne bhi ek halki muskuraahat ke saath apni sahmati de di
 i liked both this method of selling and Salika
 ye or baat he ki rajesh vaali sari mujhe bhi pasand aa gai lekin bhagalpur vaale karidaar ne apana iraadaa nahin badla
 Before posting on Facebook, i started looking at Rajesh's picture carefully
 jis lavanya yani nazaakat se sari kaa pallu laharaaya tha wo ek behatar celsman kii kartavyanishtha kaa uttam udhaaharan he
 For that moment, Rajesh not only wore a sari but also got into it to highlight the beauty of the sari
 apane fasebuk par post karne ke baad jo pratikriyaayein ain unase laga ki aap pathakon ke liye is vrutant ko likhnaa chahie
 Most of the people have appreciated Rajesh's honesty about his work and also saluted him
 kai logon ne yah bhi kaha he ki purush to sari aise hi bech rahe hai, aapako ab pataa chalaa he
 If some people do not know late, then the stories will end with writing and printing in the world
 isliye mujhe der se pataa chalane par khaas hairaani nahin hui
 But more than three thousand likes, more than one hundred and fifty comments and more than fifty shares further added to my interests
 aakhir is tasviir main aisa kya he ki jaanane or nahin jaanane vaale donon hi sukhad ahsaas se bhar gaye
 The comments main un tippaniyon ko padhate hue yah jaanane laga ki ab to har jagah mard hi sari baandh kar bataate hai ki kis sari kii kya luk hoga
 Devashish has written that such people will also be found in the shops of Patna market and Amit Tiwari has written that men have been seen selling Rajesh like that in Hyderabad's Ameerpet
 priyadarshini ne likhaa he ki maharashtra ke ahmednagar aaiye
 Here every saree salesman wears it himself
 vanamrata ne likhaa he ki chandani chowk main saadiyaan kharidne jaaiye to har dukaan isi tarah se swaagat karti dikhaai detii he
 There is also a laugh at their style and the passion to do their work with all their heart is also seen
 ye cells taak jaisi bijness stratji he jo bijness skulon main nahin padhai jaati
 i did not get a complete answer to my question of what a woman would think when she saw a man tying a sari
 uske bare main sochati hogi yaa sirf sari ke bare main! vaise deepak ne mere fasebuk pej par dilli ke lajpat nagar kii ek tasviir bheji he
 Can't verify the picture but guess what happens
 ek sari pratiyogita to honi hi chahie ki koun behatar baandh saktaa he, mard yaa aurat That is why the world around us has changed
 isliye zyaadaatar log rajesh kii tarif kar rahe hai
 i do not agree with one of the two comments that Rajesh's house or friends would be embarrassed to know
 is maansikta ko rajesh jaise purushon ne kab tak utaar phenkaa hoga varna banaras se lekar patna or ahmednagar tak sari baandh kar uski kubsuurati nikhaarane vaale mard celsmanon kii duniya kaa vistaar nahin hua hota
 By the way, saris are also made with the hands of men
 shaayad saadiyon kaa bhi sansar badal gaya he
 Pinky Pandey has written that earlier the ends of the saris were identified by the different design of the pallet, now in the fashion of these multicolored pickup saris, where to laugh and where to laugh and where to go is to be understood
 agar ye baat he to rajesh ji ke ghar main kya hota hoga
 Who would have made the final decision on how the sari is worn
 rajesh yaa rajesh kii patni! vaise mard sari pahan sakate hai, hai na! i was going through my dislike between sarees on the other table when i looked at Rajesh
 saadiyon ko vahiin choda or bag se phone nikaal kar tasviir lene kii ijazat maangi
 If the lady who was showing me the sari also wanted it, she could remove my doubts by tying the saris like Rajesh, but she missed it
 bas itnaa zarur kiya ki meri tasviir ke liye rajesh se puch liya
 Rajesh also gave his consent with a light smile
 bechney kaa yah tarika or salika donon mujhe behad pasand aa gaya
 It is another matter that i also liked Rajesh sari but Bhagalpur buyer did not change his mind
 fasebuk par post karne se pehle main rajesh kii tasviir ko gaur se dekhne laga
 The elegance with which the sari's pallu was waved is a perfect example of the dedication of a better salesman
 us kshan ke liye rajesh ne sirf sari hi nahin pahani balki sari kii khoobasarati ko ubhaarne ke liye usamen dhal gaye
 The responses that came after posting on your Facebook thought that you should write this account for the readers
 zyaadaatar logon ne rajesh kii apane kaam ke prati eemaandaaree ko saraahaa he or celut bhi kiya he
 Many people have also said that men are selling saris like this, now you know
 kuch logon ko der se na pataa chale to duniya main likhane or chhapane ke saath hi kahaniyon kaa ant ho jaae
 So i was not surprised to find out late
 lekin teen hazaar se zyaada likes, dedh sau se zyaada coment or pachaas se zyada share ne meri dilchaspiyon ko or kured diya
 After all, what is it in this picture that both knowing and not knowing were filled with pleasant feeling
 tippaniyan While reading those comments, i started to know that now everywhere men are tied in saris and they tell what will look like
 devashish ne likhaa he ki patna market kii dukaanon main bhi aise log mil jaaenge or amit tiwari ne likhaa he ki hyderabad ke amirpet main mardon ko rajesh kii tarah bechate dekha he
 Priyadarshini has written that come to Ahmednagar in Maharashtra
 yahaan har sari celsman khud hi pahanakar bataata he
 Vanamrita has written that every shop looks welcoming in the same way when you go to buy saris in Chandni Chowk
 inke andaaz par hansi bhi aati he or apane kaam ko puure man se karne kaa jazbaa bhi dikhaai detaa he
 It is a business strategy like Sales Talk which is not taught in business schools
 vanamrata ke jawaab se mere is sawaal kaa puraa jawaab nahin mila ki ek mahila kisi purush ko sari baandhte dekh kya sochati hogi
 Must think about it or just about saree! Well Deepak has sent a picture of Lajpat Nagar in Delhi on my Facebook page
 tasviir satyapit to nahin kar saktaa lekin andaaza to ho hi jaataa he
 There must be a sari competition, who can tie better, man or woman isiilie kaha ki hamaare aasapaas kii duniya badal gai he
 That's why most people are praising Rajesh
 main ek do tippaniyon se sahamat nahin hum ki rajesh ke ghar yaa doston ko pataa chalegaa to use sharmindagi hogi
 How long would men like Rajesh throw off this mentality, or else the world of male salesmen who used to wear saris from Banaras to Patna and Ahmednagar would not have expanded
 vaise sari banati bhi he mardon ke haath se
 Perhaps the world of saris has also changed
 pinki pandey ne likhaa he ki pehle saadiyon ke siron kii pahchaan palle ke alag dizin se hoti thi, ab in bahurangi batorua saadiyon ke fishan main kidar khonsnaa he or kidar kaa khonsnaa he or kidar kaa pallaa lenaa he aise hi samajhnaa or samajhaana padegaa
 If this is the case then what would have happened in Rajeshji's house
 sari kaise pahani gai he iskaa antim faisla koun karata hoga
 Rajesh or Rajesh's wife! Well, men can wear saris, right! main un tippaniyon ko padhate hue yah jaanane laga ki ab to har jagah mard hi sari baandh kar bataate hai ki kis sari kii kya luk hoga
 Devashish has written that such people will also be found in the shops of Patna market and Amit Tiwari has written that men have been seen selling Rajesh like that in Hyderabad's Ameerpet
 priyadarshini ne likhaa he ki maharashtra ke ahmednagar aaiye
 Here every saree salesman wears it himself
 vanamrata ne likhaa he ki chandani chowk main saadiyaan kharidne jaaiye to har dukaan isi tarah se swaagat karti dikhaai detii he
 There is also a laugh at their style and the passion to do their work with all their heart is also seen
 ye cells taak jaisi bijness stratji he jo bijness skulon main nahin padhai jaati

 agar ye baat he to rajesh ji ke ghar main kya hota hoga
 Who would have made the final decision on how the sari is worn

 punam, haal hi main aapane khud ko ‘bahut sharmili’ bataaya
 Just after that 'something' happened to you in Mumbai
 khud par aapke coment se yah ghatana match nahin kar rahi he
 For this reason, i am forced to write this open letter
 khud ke bare main aapane ek aisi jaankaree di he, jisase aaj kii yuva peedi pehle se hi waakif he
 It is probably not wrong to say that you are definitely shy, the whole fault lies in our eyes
 apni baat kehane ke liye mujhe kuch or shabd kharch karne honge
 In fact, your fame reached the houses on which Thakur Prasad or similar calendars hang on the walls
 kingfisher calendar tak hamaari pahunch nahin he, so is bare main hamane mahaj kuch kisse hi sun rakhe hai
 You only know what the truth is
 baharhaal, aapke naam kii dhooma tab machi, jab team india kaa hausala badhaane ke makasad se worldcup ke thik pehle aapane kuch elaan kiya
 You said that if Team India wins the World Cup, then you are ready to be nude
 jab dhoni ke dhurandharon ke haathon main chamchamata worldcup aa gaya, to har kisi kii nigahen aapako hi talash rahi thim
 
 
 Where is Poonam Pandey now? Well, soon the illusion of people broke
 tab pehali baar hamen is baat kaa pakkaa yakeen hua ki aap sachmuch bahut sharmili hai
 It was in our eyes that we understood your feeling of making the biggest 'sacrifice' for Team India
 tab se lekar ab tak apane sainkadon photograph aapane twitor or fasebuk ke jariye apane diwaanon tak pahunchaai hai
 One thing is common in all those pictures
 sabamein aapke chehre se maasoomiyat jhalkati he
 Even if someone stubbornly looks down from your face, every time he feels despondent
 uski haalat us research jaisi hoti, jo Centre(s) of Gravity par kuch nae tathy kaa pataa lagane nikalataa ho, par har baar dharti ke gol hone ke suparichit tathy ke saath hi apana-sa munh liye laut jaataa ho
 Every photo says that you have definitely set your own limits, so that even those with bad eyes can stay within their limits
 main to kahuunga ki sharmaana kise kehete hai, yah koi aap se sikh len
 Follow your principles and learn from you
 meraa akalan he ki agar aaj bollywood ke ‘da great shoman’ jivit hote, to apane sharmilepan kii vajah se aapane unhen jarur maayoos kiya hota
 If you were the heroine of the 80s and the actresses of that era would have come under your influence, many films like 'ram Teri Ganga Maili' and 'satyam Shivam Sundaram' would have been demanding water at the box office
 aaj ke daur main bhi khub andhergardi machi he
 Some are exposed to the screen, some are taking off their covers for a magazine
 aise main aapkaa sharmilapan har kisi ko khub bhaataa he
 Ending the letter with a few requests
 pehle to us besabr photographer kii jamkar khabar lijie, jo aapke puure kapadon main taiyaar hone tak intjaar nahin kar saktaa
 Eating and drinking, sitting, lying down, bathing, washing, time and timeless takes your picture
 hamaare ilaake ke footpath par, sidhe-sidhe kahen to noida ke atta market main mahaj 100 rupee main ek, do yaa kabhi-kabhi to teen-teen chunniyaan bina molbhav kiye badi aasaani se mil jaaya karti hai
 If there is not much problem, then get it ordered and get a photo taken in the whole year by putting the scarf 'in the right place'
 apane naam ke anuroop hi aap punam ke chand-si khubasurat najar aaengi
 Forgive meekly and now do not embarrass us further by calling yourself 'very shy'

 In the Ranji Trophy 41 times, Champion Mumbai has won the Vijay Hazare Trophy for the third time
 isse pehle usne 2003-04 or 2006-07 main khitaab jeeta tha
 Delhi became champions in 2012-13, but had to settle for the second time as runners-up
 em chinnaswami stadium main khele gaye final main donon tiimon kii shuruyaat acchhee nahin rahi
 Delhi, who were invited to bat first, lost three wickets, including captain Gautam Gambhir, for 21 runs, while Mumbai's three batsmen were still in the pavilion till reaching 25 runs

 Rishabh's ODI debut fixed, Team India's declaration against Windies, Annavandeep Saini (3 for 53) played a key role in shaking Mumbai's top order
 westeindies ke khilaaf test cricket main padaarpan par hi prabhaavshaalee pradarshan karne vaale prithvi (aath) ne unki pehali do gendon par chauke lagaae lekin behtareen length se kii gai teesri gend is yuva ballebaaj ko bold kar gai
 Saini then lbw Rahane (10) while Suryakumar Yadav (four) was caught in the second slip
 mumbai ko captain shreyas ayyar se kaaphi ummiden thi jinhone semifinal main naabad ardhashatak jamaaya tha
 Iyer also got a lifeline but he continued to tamper with the outgoing balls and was caught by wicketkeeper Unmukt Chand after scoring only seven runs
 tare or laad ne yaheen se jimmedaari sanbhali
 Both of them put together a combination of defensive and aggressive batting
 is bich bhagya ne bhi unka saath diya kyonki donon ballebaajon ko ek -ek avasar par tisare ampire kii madad se jeevandaan mila
 The Indian bowler, who is dreaming of playing World Cup 2019, broke this partnership by lbw to the star but it was too late for Delhi
 tare ne apni pari main 13 chauke or ek chakka lagaaya
 Lad also returned to the pavilion at the last minute
 unhone chaar chauke or do chakke lagaae
 Dubey remained unbeaten after scoring 19 runs
 isse pehle gambhir (ek) ne pari ke duusare over main hi deshpandey kii gend slash karne ke prayaas main therdman par kaich diya jabaki unmukt (13) kii kharaab form jari rahi
 Rahane was caught by Kulkarni with a dive and Manan Sharma (five) took Deshpande's ball to the wicketkeeper's gloves

 Dubey took his first wicket as Nitish Rana (13)
 jab team sankat main thi tab dhruv shore (31) or himmat singh (41) se acchhee shuruyaat ko bade score main tabdeel karne kii ummid thi lekin in donon ne aasaani se apane wicket inaam main die
 Delhi's hopes of reaching the 200-run mark came as a shock when its semi-final hero Pawan Negi was injured and retired hurt

 Subodh Bhati (25) hit three foul sixes to help Delhi reach some respectable scores
 jammu or kashmir (jammu and Kashmir) ke mudde ne desh ke saath-saath videshon main bhi hal-chal machaa di he
 In the UN Security Council meeting, it has been made clear from the Indian side that the issue of Kashmir is an internal matter of India
 iske baavjood pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan (imran Khan) ne twit kar jammu or kashmir kii taraf bharat ke ravaiye ko 'fonsiwadi' bataaya he
 However, this tweet by Imran Khan has been responded to well by Bollywood actor Kamal r Khan
 kamaal aar khan (kamaal r Khan) ne twit kar imran khan ke andaaj ko 'paakhandee' bataate hue pioke (pakistan Occupied Kashmir) ke janata ko aazaadee dene kii salaah di he
 Sir @imrankhanpti if Kashmiri liberation should win and Kashmir should get independence
 Then at least you should give independence to ppl of POK immediately
 You are giving lecture to others but urself not doing the same thing
 It's a hypocrisy sir
 https: / / t
 co / ds5fk5xs9vboylivuda actor kamaal aar khan (kamaal r Khan) ne pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan (imran Khan) par nishaanaa sadhate hue likhaa, "sar, agar kashmiri mukti ko jeetna chahie or kashmir ko swatantraaa milani chahie
 So at least you should give freedom to the people of pok immediately
 aap dusron ko gyaan de rahe hai, lekin khud aisa bilkul bhi nahin kar rahe
 This is a hypocritical attitude
 "the fascist, Hindu Supremacist Modi Govt should know that while armies, militants & terrorists can be defeated by superior forces; history tells us that when a nation unites in a freedom struggle & does not fear death, no force can stop it from achieving its goal
 That is why the Hindutva exclusivist creed of the Modi-led Govt with its fascist tactics in IOK will fail miserably in its attempt to smother the Kashmiri liberation struggle
 bataa den ki bharat sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue or kashmir ke mudde ko uthaate hue imran khan (imran Khan) ne twit kiya tha
 In this tweet, he wrote, "the hanged, Hindu supremo Modi government should know that armies and terrorists can be defeated by superior forces
 itihaas gavaah he ki jab koi raashtra swatantraaa sangram main ekajute hota he or use mrityu kaa bhay nahin hota to koi bhi takat use apane lakshya ko hasil karne se nahin roak sakati he
 This is the reason that this attitude of the Hindutva-led Modi government will fail to suppress the Kashmiri liberation struggle

 At the party's national conference, Nitish said, "what kind of development do we want? We do not want development in which a large population is deprived of drinking water and women remain malnourished
 " unhone modi ke sujhaaye vikaas model par chutki lete hue kaha, "ham samudr kaa kinaaraa kahaan se laaen?" In its political proposal, the JD (U) has tied the time limit for the BJP to reveal the candidate's name and has also given suggestions on how the candidate should be

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday announced the names of its 46 candidates
 isamen gujarat kii 26 siton main se 15 naam ghoshit kiye gaye hai
 The names of 15 BJP candidates have also been announced on Sunday after BJP national president Amit Shah announced his election to contest from Gandhinagar seat
 15 main se 14 ummidavaar aise hai jinamein maujuuda saansadon ko hi tikat diya gaya he
 However, according to experts, if bjp's repeat theory (giving tickets to sitting mps) does not prove to be effective, then bjp's dream of getting 26 seats in 26 in Gujarat could be broken
 26 siton main ab tak 16 siten ghoshit ho chuki hai jabaki 10 siten aisi hai jahaan bijepi ke liye ummidavaar kaa chayan karnaa kaaphi mushkil kaam he
 In these, more than one big leader has expressed his desire to contest elections on one seat
 vaise main bijepi ke liye sabase bada dar ye bhi he ki agar maujuuda saansadon ko na lekar duusare netaaon ko tikat diya gaya to bijepi ke apane hi netaa baaji bigaad sakate hai
 On this bjp's dilemma of whether to give tickets or not, former Congress president Bharat Singh Solanki says that the BJP is scared, so has repeated the candidate
 bijepi ne jin 15 loksabhaa ummidavaaron ke naam kaa elaan kiya he unamem sirf ek hi maujuuda saansad kaa naam kaata gaya he
 These leaders are the current MP of Surendranagar, Devji Fatepura
 inaki jagah surendranagar se mahendra munjapara ko tikat diya gaya he, jabaki kuccha se vinod chawada, sabarkantha se dilip singh rathod, ahmedabad pashchim se dow
 Kirit Solanki, Mohanbhai Kundaria from Rajkot, Poonam Madam from Jamnagar, Narayan Bhai Kachhadia from Amreli, Dr
 from Bhavnagar

 C
 patel ko tikat diya gaya he
 Kirit Solanki of Ahmedabad has been associated for the last 4 times
 inke khilaaf bijepi ke netaaon kii andruni lamabandi kaaphi zyada he, to vahiin bharuch ke saansad mansukh vasava to khud hi apni party ke khilaaf bayaan dene ke liye jane jate hai
 Kadva and Leuva synergy between Patidars in Rajkot may be heavy for Kundaria this time
 isse saaf he ki bijepi ne ab tak gujarat kii 16 seat ghoshit kii he jinamein se sirf do seat par ummidavaar ko badla gaya he
 One LK Advani's Gandhinagar seat and Devji Fatepura's Surendranagar seat
 dekhnaa behad dilachasp hoga ki ab congress bijepi ke in ripet ummidavaaron ke khilaaf kya ranniti apanaati he
 It is often seen that repeat candidates are likely to win only when there is no anti-incumbency wave
 agar maujuuda sarkaar yaa party ke khilaaf logon main rosh ho to partiyaan maujuuda netaaon ko badalakar nae ummidavaar utaarti hai taaki logon ko kuch nayaapan lage
 However, the BJP has not done anything like this in Gujarat
 isse spasht he ki use satta kii lahar par puraa bharosa he na ki satta virdohi lahar kaa koi dar he

 iskaa maqasad gramin kshetron ke garib logon ko chuulhe se nijaat dilaanaa or gas silendar muhaiyaa karana tha
 Prime Minister Modi started this scheme from Ballia district of eastern Uttar Pradesh
 teen saal baad enditivi ne jamini haqiqat kaa gauge liya or paaya ki gas chulhaa or silendar to gharon main pahunch chukaa he, lekin khaanaa pakaane ke paaramparik taur-tareeqe hi prachlit hai
 Guddi Devi of Ballia is the wife of a brick kiln worker and mother of three children

 In a program in this district of eastern Uttar Pradesh, he got these cylinders directly from the Prime Minister's hands

 Guddi says that the family cannot afford to fill cylinders every month and it is cheaper to burn an old stove
 jo gas agency he, wo gadhwaar main guddi ke ghar se teen kilometre dur he
 It has the responsibility of Ujjwala connection in one thousand houses in 25 villages
 inamen guddi devi kaa conection bhi he
 Agency employees say, after the first free gas cylinder, there is hardly any regular gas cylinder refill
 har gaanv main lagbhag yahi kahani he
 Kalavanti Kanaujia and her daughter-in-law Pinki got separate cylinders two years ago in Aundi
 wo donon do parivaar chalaati hai

 bataaya jaataa he ki smartphone kaa rier camera 20 megapixl ho hoga or bydaree 3,000 mah kii hogi
 a very impractical aspect of the 360 degree change in the economic policy of the country in 1991 was that no major attempt was made to change its administrative system
 aisa iske baavjood rahaa ki pratham prashasnic sudhaar ayog (1969) tathaa dwitiya prashasnic sudhaar ayog (2010) ne aisa karne ke liye kaha tha
 The indication of these commissions was towards making government service professional
 haalanki shrimati indira gandhi se lekar dow manmohan singh tak ke kaarykaal main ikke-dukke visheshgy ucch padon par laae gaye, lekin is disha main pehla bada kadam haal ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan sanyukt sachiv ke str par nau visheshgyon kii niyukti kar uthaaya gaya
 It was surprising that these positions ranged from professors at Columbia, Carnal and Yale universities in the US to professionals working in global companies like Apple, Google and Facebook
 isi kram main ab centre sarkaar ne upasachiv evam nideshak str ke 40 padon ke liye aavedan maange hai
 But one major difference between earlier and now appointments is that the earlier appointments were made by the Union Public Service Commission, the country's highest constitutional recruitment agency
 ab vaali niyuktiyaan niti ayog dwaara kii jaaengi
 This is a tremendous policy change
 upasachiv evam nideshak hi aage chalakar sanyukt sachiv banate hai, jo bharat sarkaar kaa vyaavhaarik str kaa karypalak kaa pad he
 These appointments in these levels seem to indicate that skilled people can be given the responsibility of joint secretary post
 chunki ye pehle se hi sarkari karypranali se parichit ho chuke honge, isliye ye ucch padon ke dayitvon ko adhik achche se nibhaa sakenge
 In many countries like the US, UK and New Zealand, this system is working well
 kuch isi tarah ke parivartan kii jhalak pradhanmantri ke mantriparishad main bhi dikhaai de rahi he
 The appointment of a retired Indian Foreign Service officer as a foreign minister by giving cabinet rank directly reflects the Prime Minister's confidence in the professionals
 aaj unke chaar mantralayon ko naukarshah-mantri sambhaal rahe hai, or kuch mantralay to aise hai, jin par mantriyon kii bajaay unke sachivon kii pakad adhik he
 With the changing times, preference is being given to professionals
 iske bare main yah bhi zaruri he ki sarkaar apane un profeshnal naukarshahon kaa bhi samuchit upyog kiye jane par dhyaan de, jo uske khajaane main uske paas hameshaa maujuud rahete hai
 If we leave IAS, then all the remaining services of the central government are more or less the same as professional service
 udhaaharan ke taur par IPS, audit and account sarvice, bhartiya soochna seva, bhartiya arthshaastra seva, bhartiya sankhyikeey seva, bhartiya ejineering seva aadi
 The great irony of our administrative system is that all other services of the country are controlled by the IAS
 haasyaaspad baat yah he ki in logon ko us vibhaag ke bare main isse pehle koi gyaan nahi hota
 But on arrival, they are considered omniscient, and their views and decisions about that department are valid
 pichley itane varshon se desh is sankat ko bhugat rahaa he
 My question here is that when the government has to appoint the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of the country, why does it not look to the officers of the Audit and Account Service for this
 vibhinn mantralyon ke sachiv IAS hi kyon bane, jabaki uske profeshnal us mantralay main pehle se hi hai
 
 
 The Clearly, being governed by the IAS, these experts feel extremely neglected and humiliated
 inhen IAS ke samaan avasar dekar sarkaar inaki kshamta evam vishay kii visheshgyata kaa samuchit upyog kar sakati he
 Since they are very well versed with the functioning of the government, they will also be more convenient
 is disha main aavashyak kadam uthaae jane kii nihaayat hi zarurat he

 Justice Rakesh Kumar also said that the judicial officer against whom the charge of corruption has been proved, is also discharged with a nominal sentence instead of being dismissed
 sting main court karmchaaree ghoose lete pakade jate hai phir bhi unpar karrwai nahin kii jaati
 Taking cognizance in the Sting case, Justice Kumar handed over the investigation to the CBI
 is dauraan unhone sarkari bangalon main ho rahe fizoolkharch kaa bhi zikr kiya tha
 He had said that crores of rupees of taxpayers are spent on decoration in the government bungalows of judges
 justise rakesh kumaar ne apane aadesh kii prati supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish, supreme court collegium, piemo, kanoon mantralay or CBI nideshak ko bhi bhejne kaa aadesh court main diya tha
