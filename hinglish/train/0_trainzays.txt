 OBC Creamy layer does not get demand for sending SC / ST creamy layer dispute over reservation layer case to 7-judge bench
 Reservation Center's Narendra Modi government on Monday appealed to Supreme Court that reservation to creamy layer of SC / ST community The court sent it to a 7-member constitution bench to reconsider its order to keep it out of the benefit of
 supreme court kii paanch sadasyon kii samvidhan peeth ne 2018 main kaha tha ki anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati ke samrudh log yani ki krimi layer ko college main daakhile tathaa sarkari naukariyon main aarakshan kaa laabh nahin diya ja saktaa
 But now the Center has requested the Supreme Court that this decision be sent to the Bench of 7 judges
 somvaar ko atorni general keke venugopal ne ucchtam nyaayalay se apil kii ki is faisle par punarvichaar karne ke liye ise 7 jajon kii bench ke paas bheja jaae
 On Monday, Attorney General KK Venugopal told the bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde, Justice Suryakant and Justice BR Gavai during the hearing on the PIL of the Samata Andolan Samiti that the question which was considered by the Supreme Court in the case of Jarnail Singh in 2018 He should be referred to a seven-judge bench of the Supreme Court
 supreme court 2 hafte main is maamle kii sunwaayee karegi
 What is the 2018 verdict: In 2018, during the hearing of the Jarnail Singh case, a five-judge bench agreed to a 2006 verdict
 2006 kaa ye maamla em nagaraj kaa he
 In this judgment, the court had justified the application of creamy layer principle during promotion in SC / ST jobs
 2018 main bhi aisa hi faisla dete hue adaalat ne kaha ki anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajatiyon ke liye aarakshan main bhi krimi layer kaa niyam lagu hoga
 Justice Nariman had said, "the purpose of reservation system is to mainstream the backward classes among the citizens so that they can walk hand in hand on the basis of equality like other citizens of India
 " adaalat ne tippanee karte hue kaha tha ki agar ek varg ke kuch samrudh tabake yani ki krimi layer saarvajanik kshetra kii sabhi naukariyon par kabja kar len or ise jari rakhen to isse usee varg ke duusare pichde vanchit vaise hi rah jaaenge, jaise ve pehle the
 The court had said that when the SC applies the SC / ST circumcision layer, it does not tamper with Articles 341 and 342 of the Indian Constitution in any way
 kya hota he krimi layerkrimi layer shabd kaa istemaal mandal ayog ke praavdhaanon ke mutabik kiya jaataa he
 Right now it means the affluent among the OBC class
 obisi main krimi layer ke tahat aane vaale logon ko aarakshan ke laabh se vanchit rakhaa jaataa he
 This is done on the basis of legal provision
 obisi samooh ke wo ummidavaar krimi layer main maane jate hai jinke parivaar kii salanaa aay 8 lakh rupee yaa usase kam hoti he
 How does the creamy layer of SC / ST differ from the creamy layer of OBC? The question arises that when the OBCK creamy layer does not get the benefit of reservation, then why should the creamy layer of SC-ST get the benefit of reservation? Ashok Kumar Bharti aajtak, President of the National Confederation of Dalit Organization
 in se baat karte hue kehete hai ki daliton or obisi ke krimi layer alag hote hai
 He says in support of his argument, "SC / ST have been socially, economically and historically disadvantaged, they were forced to stay out of society
 inke khilaaf anyaay kaa bhav ab bhi samaaj main barkaraar he
 This is not the case with obcs
 unke paas bhoomi he, saadhan hai haalanki shiksha ke maamle main ve bhi vanchit hai
 "ashok Bharti says that the Scheduled Castes did not even have the right to own property
 unhen haal hi main ye adhikaar mila he
 Giving another argument, Ashok Bharti said that untouchability does not happen to obcs
 lekin essi / eseti ab bhi in saamaajik kuritiyon kaa shikaar he
 How the 5-judge Bench can award against the Bench of 9 Judges It is necessary to mention the Indra Sawhney Case of 1992 while discussing the SC / ST reservation
 ashok bharti kehete hai ki 1992 main indra saahani banaam union of india ke maamle par bani supreme court kii 9 jajon kii bench desh main aarakshan par bani ajtak kii sabase badi bench he
 This bench had said that the principle of creamy layer cannot apply to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
 2018 ke jaranel singh maamle main aae faisle kii samiksha karte hue ashok bharti kehete hai ki sawaal ye he ki paanch jajon kii bench nau jajon kii bench ke khilaaf objarveshan / jajment kaise de sakati he?doodh diya nahin
 
 
 Ashok Bharti, who wants to remove cream, said that the Constitution of India considered Scheduled Castes and Tribes as a class
 anusuchit jati or janajati ke kuch-kuch chehre or awaajen jo aapako sunai de rahi hai wo aarakshan kii vajah se hi he
 He said that the government has not yet given milk to scheduled castes and tribes and wants to remove the cream
 unhone kaha ki agar essi / asti category ko krimi layer main lagu karne kii koshish hui to ve sarkaar kaa datakar virodh karenge
 No concept of creamy layer for SC / ST
 Professor Ratan Lal is against applying creamy layer formula in SC ST
 aajtak
 Speaking to in, he said that there is no concept of creamy layer in the constitution regarding AC / ACT
 unhone kaha ki ek anasuchit raashtrapati ban jaataa he phir bhi uski jati barkaraar rahati he
 He does not get entry into the temple
 unhone kaha ki adaalat ko sanvaidhanik rup se vyavhaar karnaa chahie
 The legislature is paramount in the country and not the judiciary
 unhone sawaal kiya ki kya essi, asti ko 22
 Got 5 percent reservation? First they should get reservation for their quota
 professor ratan laal ne kaha ki aarakshan garibi unmoolan program nahin he, balki pratinidhitiv kii vyavastha he
 The arguments are also no less in support of the creamy layer; PK Malhotra, former secretary of the Ministry of Law and Justice, has the opposite argument
 rajyasabha tivi ke saath baatcheet main unhone kaha ki kanoon bananaa sarkaar kaa kaam he or uski vyakhya karnaa supreme court kaa
 The SC / ST case of creamy layer has come to light through the interpretation that the Supreme Court has made from time to time
 pike malhotra ne kaha ki samvidhan nirmaataaon ko laga ki jo tabaka saamaajik or shaikshanik rup se pichhadaa he use vishesh adhikaar die jane chahie
 Under this, he got reservation for about 70 years
 lekin itane lambey samay ke baad sarkaar ko ye laga ki aarakshan kii arhata / yogyata tay karne ke liye isamen aarthik halaat bhi jode jane chahie
 Under this, the 103rd amendment was made in the constitution and the economic situation was also linked with the reservation
 malhotra kehete hai ki shaayad supreme court kaa ab ye kahana he ki essi / asti ko jo adhikaar die gaye hai unhen bina chhue kya usee samooh ke andar jo aarthik rup se majboot log hai, unhen alag kar unako milane vaala aarakshan un logon ko diya jaae to abtak isse vanchit rahe hai
 They say that no new class will come under this ambit of reservation, instead its benefit will be given to the people who are deprived of reservation of the same community
 rajyasabha tivi ke saath baatcheet main hi bhartiya lok prashasan santhaan ke nideshak surendra nath treepathi kehete hai ki samvidhan nirmaataaon ne jab aarakshan kaa praavdhaan kiya to wo kis uddeshy se kiya tha, is par charchaa jaruri he
 They say that the constitution is the coherence of ideas and ideals
 agar hamen avasaron kii samanta lani he to ek nyaaypurna samaaj kaa nirmaan karnaa padegaa
 If reservation does not benefit, then why are more people demanding it? wo kehete hai agar aarakshan kaa phayda zyada se zyada logon ko mili to wo acha he

 On Monday, the Samajwadi Party even warned that once the bill is passed, it will revisit support to the UPA

 Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh has said that he is against the terrorism of both minority and majority communities

 Singh said that there is no question of his being against Hindus, because he himself is a true Hindu who believes in Hinduism
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa hameshaa yah kahati rahati he ki saare musalmaan aatankwaadi nahin hai, lekin jitne bhi log aatankwaad ke is maamle main pakade gayi he ve sab musalmaan hai
 The Congress general secretary said that he would like to answer this by saying that not all Hindus are terrorists in his eyes, but many terrorists have been caught, they have links with the RSS or its affiliates

 Also classic shows like Nukkad & Wagle Ki Duniya Anna Hazare has written a letter to UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi, upset over the revelations issued for the last two days about members of civil society included in the drafting committee of the Lokpal bill
 anna ne apni chitthee main congress netaa digvijay singh or kapil sibbal ke bayanon par sawaal uthaae hai
 Anna Hazare has written in his letter, what has happened in the last two days is a matter of concern
 aisa lagata he ki desh ke bhrasht log bill draft karne kii prakriya ko rokna chaahate hai
 a Congress general secretary is making repeated statements and i think he has the support of the party
 congress mahasachiv ke zyaadaatar bayaan sahi nahin hai
 Anna has asked Sonia if she supports his statements
 anna ne apni chitthee main kapil sibbal ke bayaan par bhi sawaal uthaae hai
 Anna has written that after the first meeting a minister gave a statement that the meeting was good, but later also said that civil society is kneeling before the government
 pichley dinon digvijay singh ne sanyukt samiti ke sah-adhyaksh shanti bhushan par elahabaad main ek bhukhand kharidne par kam stamp duty dene ke aarope lagaae the or samiti main samaaj kii ore se shaamil artiai kaaryakarta arvind kejariwal ko aruna roy kaa chela kaha tha
 Expressing concern over the statements by the society on the members involved in the joint committee, Hazare questioned in the letter, what will be the consequences if the committee nominates people nominated by the government in a similar manner? However, we do not want to distract the attention of the Lokpal Bill by personally throwing mud
 unhone kaha ki lekin aisa prathit hota he ki (samiti main samaaj kii ore se shaamil sadasyon ke khilaaf) is tarah kaa dushprachaar abhiyaan chalaane ke peeche makasad laanchhan lagaana hi he
 Hazare said that after the first meeting of the joint committee, a minister falsely accused us in private and informal conversations with journalists at his residence that we have succumbed to the pressure of the government within the committee and we have drafted the proposed law Has made it lighter
 unhone kaha, yah baat puri tarah se galat he, kyonki samiti main prastaavit kanoon ko lekar koi charchaa hui hi nahin thi
 "we were apprehensive of such mischievous conduct," Hazare said, therefore demanded that a video recording of every meeting of the committee be made and released immediately after the meeting
 patr main gandhivadi kaaryakarta ne likhaa, ham is ummid ke saath samiti main shaamil hue hai ki majboot bhrashtachar nirodhak vidheyak ke masaude ko milakar taiyaar kiya jayega
 (also from input language) jad you adhyaksh sharad yadav ne aarope lagaaya ki manase pramukh raaj thakare congress kii ‘kathputli’ hai jiskaa istemaal vah rajya main chunavi phaayde ke liye shivasena-bhaajapa gathbandhan ke khilaaf kar rahi he
 When Yadav was asked about the MNS chief's remarks against Hindi news channels, he said that Raj Thackeray is a puppet of the Congress and is using them against the Shiv sena-bjp alliance in the state
 raaj ne aarope lagaaya ki hindi samachar channel unke bayaan ko tod-marodakar pesh kar rahe hai
 He said that Hindi news channels should not broadcast news without understanding the issue
 yadav ne kaha ki manase pramukh kaa koi mahatv nahin he or vah is tarah kaa bayaan vahaan marathi aabaadi ko bhadakaane or shivasena ke vot bank main send lagane ke liye de rahe hai
 He said that Raj Thackeray is trying to incite Hindi channels to run his political agenda
 mumbai main party kii baithak ko sambodhit karte hue raaj ne kaha ki main hindi samachar channelon se kahana chahta hum ki prasaaran karne se pehle ve mudde ko samajhen, anyathaa ise rokna ham jaanate hai
 In the meeting of the Council of Ministers chaired by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, organic farming of the state was approved
 is niti kaa uddeshy mitti kii urvartaa sudhaarna, krishi laagat main kami tathaa kheti ko laabhakaari bananaa he
 After the cabinet meeting, Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Narottam Mishra informed that a state biological mission will be formed under this policy
 unhone kaha ki mishan ke dwaara krishi sambandhit vibhinn vibhaagon ke saath milakar kaaryayojna banaai jaaegi
 He informed that food grains, vegetables, fruits, spices, forest produce and medicinal crops have been included in the organic agriculture policy
 jaivik utpaadak sansthaaon kaa vikaas kiya jayega or jaivik utpaadakon tathaa bazaar ke bich samuchit samanvay sunishchit kiya jayega
 He said that schemes of various departments will be merged and consumer awareness programs will be run
 iske alaava carbon vyapaar ke liye sanrachana or sambhaavnaaon kaa vikaas kiya jayega
 Organic inputs such as organic manure, organic pesticides, organic plant protection substances will be encouraged
 maharashtra main sarkaar banane ko lekar chal rahi gatirodh ke bich shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari se mulaakaat kii
 According to Mila information, Sanjay Raut reached Raj Bhavan at 5 pm
 is mulaakaat ke baad raut ne kaha ki sarkaar gathan ko lekar jari gatirodh ke liye unki party jimmedaar nahin he
 He said that whoever has the majority will form his own government
 unhone kaha ki hamanen maujuuda sthiti ko lekar rajyapal se baat kii he
 Raut said that the meeting with the governor was completely non-political
 is mulaakaat ke dauraan rajyapal or raut ke bich rajya main maujuud raajnneetik sthiti par bhi baat hui
 He said that we had put our point before the Governor which he heard very well
 ham unhen bas yahi bataanaa chaahate the ki sarkaar kaa gathan nahin ho paa rahaa he or iske liye hamaari party jimmedaar nahin he
 Explain that after the assembly election results in the state, talks between the Shiv Sena and the BJP are not being done about the Chief Minister's post
 shivasena rajya main 50-50 ke formule ko lagu karana chaahati he
 Under which, two and a half years will be bjp's and two and a half years will be the Chief Minister of Shiv Sena
 lekin bijepi shivasena ke is prastaav par sahamat nahin ho rahi he
 Amid the ongoing deadlock over government formation in Maharashtra, senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had said on Sunday that his party would only talk to the BJP on the issue of the post of chief minister
 rajya main 24 oktober ko vidhansabha chunaav parinaam ghoshit hone ke baad se donon gathbandhan saajheedaaron ke bich mukhyamantri pad ko lekar gatirodh bana hua tha
 In this election, Shiv Sena won 56 seats and BJP 105 seats in the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly
 raut ne patrakaron se kaha tha ki gatirodh jari he
 There is no talk about government formation yet
 agar baatcheet hogi, to keval mukhyamantri pad ko lekar hi hogi
 According to the news agency ANI, Sanjay Raut had said that we have the support of more than 170 mlas
 yah aankada 175 bhi ho saktaa he
 At the same time, in the weekly column of the Sena mouthpiece 'saamana', Raut said that the political deadlock over the formation of a new government in Maharashtra is like 'a chariot stuck in the mud of arrogance'
 unhone saptahik stambh main raut bhaajapa ko rajya main raashtrapati shashan laga kar dikhaane kii chetavanee dete hue kaha tha ki yah kadam party kii ‘sadi kii sabase badi haar' hogi
 He said that it is shocking that those people are talking about celebrating the Emergency declared by Indira Gandhi as 'black Day'
 shivasena kaa yah bayaan bhaajapa ke mukhyamantri pad saajha naa karne ke apane rukh par ade rahane or party ke netaa sudhir mungantivar ke saat navambar tak nai sarkaar kaa gathan naa hone par rajya main raashtrapati shashan kii taraf badhane kii baat kehane ke baad aayaa he

 Supreme Court Chief Justice J

 justise khehar ke mutabik, ab kanoon todna or court kii avmaananaa karnaa dhire-dhire hamaare culture or khun main aa gai he
 Justice Khehar made these remarks during a hearing on Friday, according to the news of Mail Today
 unhone kaha ki aisa bilkul nahin saha ja saktaa he, agar aap ek tarakkee vaala desh bananaa chaahate ho to aapako kanoon kaa paalan karnaa hoga
 If the law is not followed then you will get punished
 justise ne kyon kii tippaneedilli ke lajpat nagar main ek institute ke head dinesh khosla ke dwaara ghar kii building kaa upyog commercial ke taur par kar rahe the
 This comment of the SC can also be seen by Vijay Mallya's contempt of court, Mallya repeatedly refused to appear in court despite the court's order
 sharaab kaarobaari maalya 9000 karod rupee kaa karj lekar faraar hai, haal hi main maalya ne kaha tha ki vah euke main surakshit mahasoos karte hai

 Reversing Rahul Gandhi's 'owl' comment, BJP today said that voters are not really owls and they are going to oust the Congress from power in this Lok Sabha election
 bijepi ke varisht netaa arun jetali ne apane blog main kaha ki jab matadaata congress ke khilaaf matdaan karte hai to ve ullu nahin hai
 a leader should not lose his decency by seeing defeat in front
 jo log congress ke viruddh matdaan kar rahe hai, uski kuch vajah hogi
 He said, angry voters are not the words of those four letters as Rahul has chosen for them
 rahul ne kal bihar ke kishanganj main apni chunavi raily main kaha tha ki modi ji, hindustan ko ullu bananaa band karo
 The BJP leader, who is contesting the Lok Sabha elections from Amritsar, in his election diary has advised the Congress Vice President to accept that the public is angry with the Congress and the voter is inclined towards Narendra Modi
 tisare morche kaa sawaal hi nahinjetali ne kaha ki in loksabhaa chunaavon main aam bhartiya kii chintaa yah he ki koun sthir sarkaar de paaegaa or iske uttar ke rup main bijepi tathaa rajg ko laabh mil rahaa he
 Denying the possibility of a third front, he said that it does not exist at all and the Congress has been left far behind in the electoral race
 aise main rajg hi aisa ekmaatr vikalp he jiske paas sarkaar banane kaa vaastavik avasar he

 com / vdqspwfihw Another blotting incident has come to light on the 'beti bachao-beti Padhao' slogan of the BJP government in Haryana
 chandigarh main ghatit varnika kundu cese jaisaa hi maamla fatehabad main saamne aayaa he
 The police arrested Manjeet Goswami, president of Fatehabad bjp's youth wing Manjit Goswami and his friend Gaurav, on charges of stalking a minor student of class 11
 peedit chaatra ke anusaar lagaataar 3 din se uskaa peechha kar use pareshaan kiya ja rahaa tha
 He was chased again on Saturday, returning from school
 iske baad unhone bullate bike par savaar dono yuvakon ke paas aate hi bike kii chaabi nikaal lee or phir aasapaas ke logon kii madad se donon yuvakon ko police ke hawaale kar diya
 On the spot, the police took both the youths into custody and brought them to the police station, but when both the youths were questioned in the police station, a youth leader of the BJP came out
 udhar bijepi netaa ko chaatra se chhedchhad ke aarope mempulicedwara hiraasat main liye jane kii jaankaree bijepi ke aalaa netaaon ke paas pahunchi to aaropee bijepi netaa ko bachaane kii koshishen shuru ho gai
 The incident happened with the student in the afternoon and it was evening to write an FIR to the police under the pressure of power
 haalanki esechao to itane dabaav main aa gaye ki unhone peedita ke bayaan darj hone se pehle hi bijepi netaa manjit ko maamle main clin chit dekar chhod diya or sirf bijepi netaa ke dost gaurav ke khilaaf hi exiaar likhakar karrwai shuru kii
 At the same time, it has been said that the relationship of the said BJP leader detained in the case is very good with Haryana BJP President Subhash Barala as well as many cabinet ministers and other big leaders
 aise main police kis bhaajapa netaa ke dabaav main manjit ko clin chit di, ye to police hi bataa sakati he
 The victim says that 2 youths were chasing her on a bullet bike and caught them both with the help of people by stopping them on their own bikes
 aise police kii karrwai par sawaal uth rahe hai
 The question is also arising that when the matter was about molesting the student, then why was the help of the police station police station delayed? purv raashtrapati apije abdul kalam ko jab bethani aspataal laayaa gaya to unke sharir main koi halchal nahin thi

 desh main rangabaaz netaaon kii jamaat main lagaataar izapha hota ja rahaa he
 One leader bats on a Municipal Corporation officer, the other makes three records with two hands and a carbine in two hands
 ye nae netaa ji uttarakhand se bijepi ke hi vidhayak hai or filmi gaanon par bandooken laharaa laharaakar rangabaazi dikhaa rahe hai
 And now his video is viral on social media
 video main jalawakareeb paune do minute ke is video main bijepi ke vidhayak kunwar pranav singh champion sharaab pite hue or haathon main bandooken lekar khud ko turramkhan samaj rahe hai
 They showed such a glow in this video that they could not even guess that they are the representatives of the public
 vidhayak kunwar pranav ne isse pehle bhi kai karnaamon ko anjaam diya he
 Who are the carbines, pistols and revolvers, Rana ji, the government is going to forgive you
 aap to kunwar hai aise das bees filmi rana to aap apni patalun jhaad den to nikal aaen
 What is his status? ji, bilkul baja farmaaya sarkaar aapane
 You can do anything
 yakeenan koi nahin he aap jaisaa
 Not seeing carbines in one hand
 duusare main teen-teen pistal
 This is a minor issue
 hathiyaaron kii numaayishai
 
 shabash
 
 kya style he kunwar sahab kaa
 Two pistols in hand, third in mouth
 vaah
 
 aapako dekhne par to tikat laganaa chahie maalik
 See the style of government
 ek taang stool par rakhi he
 Arms in hands
 ghutanon par sharaab kaa glass
 And don't mind the boss, let me also say one thing
 sando baniyaan main aap kasam se rana ji hi lag rahe hai
 If you are not sure, then mix it
 dekhie lag rahaa hai naa kunwar sahab bilkul rana ji kii tarah
 MLA from Khanpur, see these, in the Mahafil of Kunwar Saheb, they are also giving guest appearances in between
 inhen dekhie kitna mazaa aa rahaa he
 Yes
 aise hi thode naa inhen puure uttarakhand main aapako kunwar pranav singh champion kaha jaataa he
 Aali Janab is a BJP MLA from Khanpur in Haridwar
 magar samajaseva ke bajaae janaab body building or daancing main biji hai
 The MLA or the gangster does not seem to be looking at Janab to represent the public
 inkaa andaaj kisi sadakchhaap jaisaa he
 Sarkar is showing such weapons on film songs
 maano vidhayak na ho gangster hon
 This is not their first act but they are often in dispute
 sahab berthde ho yaa mundan ho
 But you are the representative of the public
 
 It doesn't suit you
 
 The question is also whether these weapons are licensed
 agar hai bhi to uski aisi numaaish kerani chahie?bijepi se nilambitwideo viral hone ke baad tamaam tarah kii charchaaen chal rahi hai
 The MLA has insulted himself with this act
 saath hi party ko bhi kai baar fajihat kara chuke hai
 Recently he has been suspended for three months due to misbehavior with journalists
 ab bhi champion vidhayak suspend hi chal rahe hai
 But what should Majal do to get rid of his antics? aaparishan ke baad jamaai mehfilvidhayak ji abhi abhi dilli se pair kaa oparation kara ke laute hai
 And as soon as he came, the music gathering was such that the feet stopped
 ab jab puri duniya main bijepi kii is champion kii fajihat ho gai to janaab ab maafee maangane ko taiyaar hai lekin is clear cat video ke baad bhi inkaa kahana he ki unke khilaaf saazish ho rahi he
 Kunwar's misdeeds, Khanpur MLA from BJP, Kunwar Pranav Champion had earlier opened fire on the driver of a roadways bus in Bahadrabad, Haridwar in 2006 simply because he had not given him a side
 2010 main mangalore ke ek kaarykram main unka firing kaa video kaaphi viral hua tha
 It was only in 2010 that Champion fired on the owner of the Polaris Hotel in Roorkee
 2013 main cabinet mantri harak singh ravat ke sarkari awaas par chal rahi dinar party main goli chalaai thi
 In 2015, Kunwar Pranav Champion had fired on villagers for mining in the stone of Haridwar
 ab unhen dilli main ek nijee channel ke reporter ko jaan se maarane kii dhamkee dene par party ne 3 maheene ke liye nilambit kiya hua he
 But this time his troubles may be bigger where the party is very angry with him, after this video went viral, Haridwar SSP has taken cognizance of the case
 or police harakat main aa gai he
 Viral video is being investigated
 agar jaanch main video sahi paaya jaataa he to haridwar ke khanpur vidhayak kii giraftaar bhi ho sakati he

 vahiin party main maujuud cricketer rahul sharma kii report abhi nahin ai he
 a sharp war on BJP through Saamana 'get used to retreat 5 years' BJP: Saamana 'shiv Sena wins majority in blatant manner' The tenure of congress-ncp-shiv Sena government led by Uddhav Thackeray has started in Maharashtra
 vidhansabha main satr kii shuruyaat dhamaakedaar rahi, jisamen bhartiya janata party ne shivasena sarkaar ke saamne kai tarah se adnge lagaae
 But now the Shiv Sena has again targeted the BJP through the confrontation and has written that the BJP should have made a habit of retreating like this for the next five years
 itnaa hi nahin vipaksh ke netaa devendra fadanvis par bhi saamana main tikhaa tanj ksaa gaya he
 Through the encounter, the Shiv Sena wrote, 'the government under Uddhav Thackeray has won the vote of confidence
 sarkaar ko mila bahumat ausat nahin balki acha or dhamaakedaar he
 There is a force of 170 mlas with the government, we were saying this from day one
 parantu fadanvis ke chatte-batton ke chashme se ye aankada 130 ke upar jane ko taiyaar nahin tha
 Many will feel like Sahyadri 'mounds' if ideas do not have the ability to fly
 aisa hi bahumat ke maamle main hua
 In the scathing editorial on Devendra Fadnis, targeting Devendra Fadnavis, the Fadnavis-led opposition ran away from the assembly after seeing 170 numbers
 ravivaar ko vidhansabha adhyaksh pad par naanaa patole kii niyukti bhi nirvirodh ho gai
 Perhaps the result of the '170' figure entering the eyes and minds of the bjpmen on Saturday was such that they had to retreat in the election for the post of Speaker of the Assembly
 ab agle 5 saal unhen isi tarah peeche hatane kii aadat daalani padegi
 'saamna's editorial', while targeting Sankatvendra Fadnavis in BJP for the leadership of the state, also gave an example of Maharashtra and Rajasthan in Saamana
 isamen likhaa gaya ‘mukhyamantri kii haisiyat se devendra fadanvis ne jo galtiyaan kin vah virdohi paksh netaa ke rup main to unhen nahin kerani chahie
 It is our desire to retain the prestige and prestige of the Leader of the Opposition
 darasal, yah bhartiya janata party kaa andruni maamla he ki kise vipaksh kaa netaa banaaen athwa kise or kya banaaen, parantu rajasthan main bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar nahin ai
 There, former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje did not sit on the chair of the Leader of the Opposition
 madhya pradesh main shivaraj singh chouhan kii bhaajapa sarkaar parajeet hui, vahaan bhi balashaali maane janevaale shivaraj singh chouhan vipaksh ke netaa nahin bane tathaa party ke anya netaa ne yah pad sambhala
 While Delhiites are doing 'fadnavis Hi Fadnavis' in Maharashtra, it has to be understood what is the real mystery behind it
 ’bahumat ke aasapaas bhi janaa sambhav na hone ke baavjood dilli ne fadanvis ko mukhyamantri pad kii shapath dilaai or us sarkaar ke dharashayi hone ke baad ab virdohi paksh ke netaa pad par bhi pun: fadanvis kii hi niyukti kar di gai
 In fact, the people of Maharashtra also needed a change in the state level leadership of the BJP and this reflection was reflected in the voting
 iske baavjood bhaajapa netritv ne vipaksh ke netaa pad parafdenvis ko hi baithaaya arthath yah unka andruni maamla hone ke kaaran ham is par zyada bolenge nahin
 But the 'drama' that the new opposition leader did on the occasion of the motion of no confidence was not right
 devendra fadanvis par nishaanaa sadhate hue saamana main likhaa gaya ki ‘main niyam or kanoon se chalanevaala insaan hum’ aisi haasyaaspad baaten unhone kahin
 But what questions did he raise during the motion of no confidence? In the name of Chhatrapati Shivarai, the ministers took oath in oath law, on which Fadnavis went to Tamtama
 shivaray kaa samaran gaiyrkanoonee tehraanevaale niyamon kii baat karte hai tathaa 105 siten is par piti jaati hai

 On this, senior level officer of National Skill Development Corporation Ajay Kumar has written a detailed post in English
 is post main ajay kumaar bataate hai ki dharmendra pradhan ne sabake saamne unhen gaaliyaan deen
 The kind of abuses that are not possible to write here
 angrezi main jinhen Cuss Word kehete hai
 Ajay Kumar, who served in the army for 23 years, has written about his public humiliation
 kya rashtrawaad rashtrawaad karne vaali modi sarkaar ke mantri ko itani chhot he ki vah sena ke ek varisht afasar ko sabake saamne gaaliyaan de sakate hai, unhen barkhaast karne ke aadesh de sakate hai?kya yah chhot is dam par he ki aisi baaten akhbaaron main nahin chhapati hai
 Not shown in news channels? Due to which the public will never know that Dharmendra will keep abusing Ajay Kumar, the officer of the Pradhan Sena for ten minutes in front of everyone
 post bahut hi lanbaa he or rashtriya kaushal vikaas nigam ke bheetar chal rahi kai tarah kii carguzariyon ke bare main likhaa he
 Ajay Kumar joined the National Skill Development Corporation because he wanted to do something for the country
 acchhee selary kii naukari kaa prastaav chhod kar isliye kam selary vaale kaam par aae
 Ajay Kumar was given two major responsibilities
 jo bhi skill centre khulne the, unki jaanch karnaa or reating dena
 Second is the flight plan for the youth of Jammu and Kashmir
 in donon ke pramukh banaae gaye
 The incident is from last year
 dilli ke constitution club main skill india kaa kaarykram tha
 Ajay Kumar was not supposed to go there but Kabina Minister Dharmendra Pradhan's office was asked to be present there
 dharmendra pradhan ne apane kisi khaas ke skill centre ko manyata dene ke liye kaha to ajay kumaar ne kaha ki mantralay ke niyamon ke mutabik inhen manyata dena mumkin nahin he
 Your oral order may not apply
 bas itane par dharmendra pradhan ukhd gaye
 Started abusing Ajay Kumar in front of everyone
 mantri ji itnaa aapa kho chuke the ki sabase saamne unhen barkhaast karne kii dhamkee dene lage
 Ajay Kumar was shocked
 sena ke is afasar ne aisa apmaan kabhi nahin dekha tha
 They started to feel naked among themselves
 ajay kumaar ne likhaa he ki vahaan par laghu va madhyam udyog mantralay ke sanyukt sachiv rajesh agarwal bhi maujuud the
 Manish Kumar, Managing Director of National Skill Development Corporation was also there
 kisi ne kuch nahin kaha
 Ajay Kumar then asked the minister to pay attention to his words
 itnaa kehane par dharmendra pradhan or bhadak gaye or gaaliyaan dene lage
 Directed the management director to give a full report on his dismissal the next morning
 vahaan par aae mehmaanon ke bich sena kaa yah afasar gaaliyaan khaataa rahaa
 He was insulted but everyone kept quiet in front of the minister's bully
 yahi nahin istipha dene ke liye legal team kii taraf se dhamkiyaan di gayi
 Threats to see his family
 yah sab ajay kumaar kaa hi likhaa hua bataa rahaa hum
 Later, the Managing Director of Prime Minister Skill Development Corporation called Ajay Kumar and said that he would have to resign
 ajay kumaar ne apana istipha likh diya
 His service ended on 31 July 2018
 unhone apane lambey post main kaushal vikaas kii karstaniyon kaa zikr kiya he
 Ajay Kumar has written the post in public after 9 months
 iskaa kaaran yah bataaya he ki skill india chhodane ke baad unhen chaar naukariyon ke prastaav mili
 Everywhere he gave the correct reason for leaving, the minister abused and resigned forcefully
 yah sunakar un companiyon ko naukari dene kii himmat nahin huin
 She was upset with his proposal
 ajay ke doston ne samajhaayaa ki kuch jhooth bol do
 Then Ajay could not stop and he has written this post in public
 dharmendra pradhan ko iskaa jawaab dena chahie
 According to his party's politics, army officers will not lie
 sena kabhi jhooth nahin bolti he
 You should trust what the army says
 to kya public bharosa kare ki pradhanmantri modi kaa ek mantri mantralay ke kaam ke silsile main apane afasaron ko gaaliyaan detaa he? ajay kumaar ko bhi lekh ke baad sabake saamne aana chahie
 When the abuses were being given, care should also be taken to Rajesh Agarwal and Manish Kumar who did not support Ajay Kumar
 system main aise kamazor afasar sirf apane liye hote hai
 Threats of government car and chair show in relatives
 magar kabhi mauka aane par tan kar khadey nahin ho pate hai

 dilli main skool parisar ke andar ek chaatr kii maut ke maamle main police ne 3 naaballig chaatro ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Police arrested the three students based on CCTV footage posted at the school
 haalanki footage main tushaar ke saath marpet karte dikh rahe chaar chaatro main se ek chaatr abhi faraar he
 According to the police, the CCTV footage clearly shows four students assaulting Tushar
 DCP ajit singhla ne bataaya ki poochtacha main aaropee chaatro ne sweekaar kiya ki unka tushaar ke saath subah jhagada hua tha
 According to the police, there was a fight between the students over Dadagiri
 darasal aaropee chaatr pehle kisi or se lard rahe the, tabhi 9veen main padhane vaale 15 varshiya tushaar ne bich main aate hue unhen lalakaara or kahahimmat he tousase ladakar dikhaaen
 After this, however, the quarrel stopped
 lekin tushaar period ke bich main jab bathroom gaya to peeche-peeche aaropee chaatr bhi bathroom main pahunch gaye or vahaan tushaar ke saath jamkar marpet kii
 According to the school management, around 11 in the afternoon on Thursday
 30 baje tushaar bathroom main behoshee kii haalat main mila
 He also suffered vomiting
 skool prabandhan ne tushaar ke gharavaalon ko suchit kiya or tushaar ko behoshee hi haalat main pehle najdiki aspataal le jaaya gaya, jahaan se use jitibi hospital refer kar diya gaya
 However, when Tushar was rushed to the GTB Hospital, the doctors declared him dead as soon as he arrived
 lekin gharavaalon ne aarope lagaaya ki skool prabandhan ne unhen galat soochna di ki tushaar bathroom main behoshee kii haalat main mila, jabaki tushaar kii skool ke andar hi maut ho chuki thi

 According to the police, so far no eyewitnesses have been found in the case and the police is now searching for the fourth accused student
 tushaar kii maut se gussaye parijanon ne skool kaa gheraav kar jamkar virodh pradarshan bhi kiya
 But this incident has once again questioned the safety of children in schools
 sawaal yah bhi he ki aakhir principal ne shuraat main kyon kaha ki baccha biimaar tha or beemaari kii vajah se maut hui he
 At present, the police say that if the negligence of the school is revealed during the investigation, then they will also be tried
 lekin sawaal he ki isaki shuruyaat kaise hui or kyon? darasal pichley shanivaar ko nepal or khaskar kathmandu sabase pehle indian media kaa dal pahunchaa or shuru ke 48 ghante wo chaahe khabar ho yaa vijuals indian media ne koi kasar nahin chodi
 Even wherever Nepal government officials or relief teams arrived, be it Sindhupalchok or Gorkha or Pokhara, reporters from the Indian news channel were reporting live from there
 lekin hamaare desh main jise videshi media yaa pashchimi deshon kii media kehete hai wo na keval kathmandu der se pahunchi, balki adhikansh logon kaa focus averest base camp tha
 Where they were ready to pay the price sought to reach everyone, but here too an Indian channel won
 darasal indian army ke ek dal ke saath is website ke news channel kaa sanyukt abhiyaan tha or is dal ke produsar aamir or camera main rakesh solanki va sanjay agarwal ne puure bukamp or himaskhalan ko apane camere main na keval kaid kiya, balki somvaar shaam wo kathmandu bhi aa gaye
 From where his footage was telecast live all over the world, which was certainly a major setback for many media houses abroad
 lekin ye to pratispardhaa kii baat hui
 
 
 Officials in Nepal were angry that India kept the Tribhuvan Airport busy for 48 hours in the process of evacuating its people, so that it could not deliver aid or say relief material from other countries
 indian media ne bhi bhartiya sena or andiaref ke bachaab kaary par puraa dhyaan kendrit rakhaa, lekin ye bhi sach he ki shuru ke dinon main kathmandu main yaa bahari ilaakon main duusare deshon ke raahat kaary teji nahin pakad paae the or indian media kaa nepali sena ke bachaab kaary kaa kawarej us str kaa nahin tha, jitna bhartiya sena kaa
 Secondly, the Nepali media people are saying why the Indian media inflicted so much of the beef masala by Pakistan, while two days ago when the copy of the Bible was being distributed in Patan Hospital adjacent to Kathmandu, people also refused, But the Indian media never made it an issue
 nepal main jab bhi kuch hua jaise 1999 main indian airline 814 ke apharan ke baad ke dinon main indian media ke khilaaf jabardast aakrosh dikhaa
 There was always a cry of the government of that time that the people of the Indian channel take help from them and show them against them, which brings a lot of disrepute to the country
 iske baad jab 2001 main narayan hiti pales main raja virendra kii unke puure parivaar sahit goli markar hatya kar di gai, tab indian media ne ye reporting kii ki goli maarane vaala shaks unka betaa dipendra tha
 There was a lot of anger at that time
 tippaniyan Later in the Nepal government's investigation, it was also found that the killer was Dipendra, but after these two incidents, the way the Indian media was targeted in Kathmandu, after that the Indian media stopped showing interest in Nepal and TRP Nepal was not important to him in the game of
 yahi kaaran hai ki maovadi gatividhi jab charam par thi, tab bhartiya media ne nepal kaa aghoshit rup se bahiskaar kiya
 There is also anger among the people and media of Nepal that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is applauding social media and especially Twitter for the help rendered by India in the midst of the earthquake tragedy

 There is also anger among the people and media of Nepal that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is applauding social media and especially Twitter for the help rendered by India in the midst of the earthquake tragedy
 nepal ke adhikari is baat ko lekar naaraaz the ki bharat ne apane logon ko nikaalane ke chakkar main 48 ghante tak tribhuvan airport ko vyast rakhaa, jisase duusare deshon se sahaayta yaa kahiye raahat saamagree nahin pahunchaa pai
 The Indian media too focused on the remaining work of the Indian Army and the NDRF, but it is also true that in the early days relief work of other countries in Kathmandu or in the outskirts did not catch up and the Indian media's Nepali army The coverage of Bachaab work was not as high as that of the Indian Army
 duusari baat nepali media ke log kah rahe hai ki bhartiya media ne pakistan dwaara bif masala ko itnaa zyada tool kyon diya, jabaki do din pehle kathmandu se sate patan aspataal main jab bible kii copy banti ja rahi thi, tab logon ne manaa bhi kiya, lekin bhartiya media ne ise kabhi mudda nahin banaaya
 Whenever something happened in Nepal, such as in the days following the hijacking of the Indian Airline 814 in 1999, there was tremendous outrage against the Indian media
 us samay kii sarkaar kaa hameshaa ronaa hota tha ki bhartiya channel ke log unase madad lekar unke khilaaf hi dikhaate hai, jisase desh kii kaaphi badanaami hoti hai
 After this, when King Virendra was shot dead along with his entire family at Narayan Hiti Palace in 2001, the Indian media reported that the person to be shot was his son Dipendra
 us samay kaaphi hai-tauba machi thi
 The comments baad main nepal sarkaar kii jaanch main bhi yahi paaya gaya ki hatyara dipendra hi tha, lekin in donon ghatnaon ke baad indian media ko kathmandu main jis tareeke se nishaanaa banaaya jaataa rahaa, uske baad indian media ne nepal main ruchi dikhaani khatm kar di or tiarapy ke khel main nepal unke liye mahatvurna nahin rahaa
 This is the reason that when the Maoist activity was at its peak, the Indian media unannouncedly expelled Nepal
 nepal ke logon or media main is baat ko lekar bhi rosh he ki bhartiya pradhanmantri narendra modi bukamp kii traasadee ke bich bharat dwaara kii gai madad ke liye soshal media or khaskar twitor par vaahvahee bator rahe hai

 grih mantri ne is baat ko doharaaya ki kendra ensitisi ko shuru karne ko icchhuk he taaki aatankwaad se kathorta se muqabla kiya ja sake
 The importance of NCTC has increased after the twin blasts in Hyderabad last week

 He has his mind
 ’ unhone yah baat is sawaal ke jawaab main kahi ki kya unhone dakshin 24 pargana jile ke freorganj main mukhyamantri ke saath hui baithak main is mudde par charchaa kii thi

 ek vyakti ne rajghat ke paas duusare vyakti par jaanaleva hamalaa kiya
 When he was brought before the court, he defended himself with a very strange argument
 usne kaha ki usne hatya kaa prayaas isliye kiya kyonki use laga ki vah mahatma gandhi kaa avatar he
 The court has sentenced him to seven years, defying the defense of this 'incarnation of Gandhi'
 rajghat ke paas 18 farvari 2003 ko ek vyakti kii hatya kaa prayaas karne ke maamle main raaj ballab ko saat saal ke karawas or paanch sau rupee ke jurmaane kii sajaa hui
 Ballabh had approached the High Court for acquittal in the case on the grounds that he suffers from a psychological disorder
 apni yachika main ballab ne kaha tha ki vah is bhranti sambandhi vikaar se peedit he ki vah mahatma gandhi kaa avatar he or use hameshaa lagata rahata he ki koi uski hatya karnaa chahta he or usne isi manosthiti main aparaadh kar diya
 She also claimed that she had been treated at the 'institute of Human Behavior and Allied Sciences'
 haalanki nyaayamurti sunita gupta ne uski apil khaarij karte hue kaha ki kisi bhranti yaa manovaigyanik yaa manorog se peedit kisi vyakti ko paagalpan ke aadhaar par tab tak bari nahin kiya ja saktaa jab tak ki yah sabit naa ho jaae ki aparaadh ke samay vah bhranti, manovaigyanik yaa manorog se peedit tha or apane krity kii prakruti ko samajhane main aksham tha yaa use yah nahin pataa tha ki jo kuch vah kar rahaa he vah galat yaa kanoon ke virodhabhasi he
 The court said that the accused spoke of insanity at a very late time when the statements of the defense witnesses were being recorded, while he should have told it during the interrogation of the prosecution witnesses during the hearing
 adaalat ne kaha ki ghatnasthal se aaropee ke bhaagane ke naakaam prayaason se in tathyon ke sanket milte hai ki vah apane krityon ke parinaam samaj rahaa tha
 Therefore, he is not entitled to benefit under section 84 (a person suffering from psychosis or psychosis at the time of crime)
 adaalat ne kaha ki aparaadh ke liye manshaa nahin hona apraasangik he kyonki chashmadidon ke bayaan vishwasaneey hai

 hatya ke aarope main auraiya se basapa vidhayak shekhar tiwari or anya logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha

 kareeb 10 din pehle hyderabad main 13 saal kii ek jain ladki kii do maah se adhik samay tak chale upwas kii samaapti ke baad maut ho gai
 Regarding this incident, the Jain community says that there is nothing that the girl's parents need to apologize
 68 din kaa upwas khatm karne ke do din baad hi aradhana samadadiya kii dil kaa daura padane se maut ho gai
 This has once again drawn the attention of the people towards the tradition of fasting in the Jain community
 uske mata-pita ke khilaaf gaiyr iradatan hatya kaa maamla darj kiya gaya he or jain netaaon kaa kahana he ki is ghatana ko bemaani bahes ke jariye tod-marodakar pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 He says that Aradhana was consuming water only during the fast and that too only twice a day
 uske mata-pita ne use aisa karne ke liye nahin kaha tha
 Aradhana's father Lakshmichand Samadadia spoke to NDTV on the 35th day of his daughter's fast and then on the 51st he told that he asked his daughter to break the fast, but she did not listen
 unhone bataaya tha ki aradhana paanch saal kii umr se hi kaaphi dharmik pravriti kii hai or pichley do saal se vah aise marathon upwas se liye training le rahi thi
 Her uncle told, in the morning she used to wake up first and recite pooja first
 unhone kaha, uske liye shok karnaa vyarth he, kyonki usne moksh paa liya he
 She has missed the cycle of life-death and achieved all this at just 13 years of age
 unhone hyderabad police ko bataaya ki upwas ek tarah kii tapasya he jo ki uske dharmik rivaaj ke mutabik jaruri he
 It is not necessary that only older children do this
 tapasya koi bhi kare usko utsav kii tarah manaaya jaataa he
 To prove that neither Aradhana nor her family acted out of any custom, the police were asked to collect photos and names from social media: a six-year-old boy in honor of a Jain saint in Ahmedabad in 2013 He fasted as long as worship; In August, in Ahmedabad itself, a six-year-old brother and a nine-year-old sister fasted for 75 days
 ahmedabad kaa chah saal kaa bhai or nau saal kii bahan jinhone 75 din kaa upwas kiya tha
 The eminent Jain Guru of Hyderabad, Ravindra Muniji, states that "people capable of fasting are confident with their experience and are then motivated to fast
" munijee yuvaaon ko lekar tapasya or anushthan kii yojana bana rahe hai
 He claims that "one to two per cent of the fasters are children, who are healthy before and after fasting
" " bhojan-pani se bachane kaa faisla lene waalon ko lekar unhone joda ki ''yah shaareerik kshamta pataa karne ke liye he
 '' Comments bal adhikaar kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki bacchon kii jaan jokhim main daalana hi nahin, kathith agnipariksha main safal hone par unka bhaavnaatmak juluus (aradhana ko ek rath main nikaala gaya tha) nikaalnaa bhi betuka he
 Abid Rasul Khan, the head of the Minorities Commission in Hyderabad said that "the issue here is the safety of children
 samudaay or varisht logon ko is bare main jaagrit hona chahie
 " sutron kaa kahana he ki police is maamle main sajagata se aage bad rahi he
 No arrests have been made so far as the cases here relate to child rights and religious traditions
 yah donon hi mudde samvedansheel hai
 Aradhana Samadia died of a heart attack two days after finishing her 68-day fast
 isane jain samudaay main upwas kii parampara kii taraf ek baar phir logon kaa dhyaan khinchaa he
 a case of culpable homicide has been registered against his parents and Jain leaders say that the incident is being manipulated through meaningless debate
 unka kahana he ki aradhana upwas ke dauraan sirf pani grahan kar rahi thi or vah bhi din main sirf do baar
 Her parents did not ask her to do so
 aradhana ke pita lakshmichand samadadiya ne enditivi se unki beti ke upwas ke 35 wein din baat kii thi or phir 51 wein din bhi unhone bataaya ki unhone apni beti se upwas todane ke liye kaha, lekin vah nahin maani
 He had told that Aradhana has been very religious since the age of five and for the last two years she was taking training for such a marathon fast
 uske chachaa ne bataaya, subah vah sabase pehle jaagti thi or sabase pehle puja paath karti thi
 They said, it is futile for him to grieve, because he has attained salvation
 vah jivan-mrityu ke chakra se chhot gai he or yah sab usne sirf 13 saal kii umr main paa liya

 Is the Communist Party of india-marxist (CPM) in panic and frustration in front of the saffron brigade? Is this why CPM leaders are holding the line of Hindutva to save their last stronghold in Kerala? Taking recourse to tricks? Photos of CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury are getting viral on social media these days
 in tasveeron main yechuri sir par mitti kaa bartan or phulon kaa gamalaa liye dikhaai de rahe hai
 BJP and RSS supporters hit out on social media with these pictures of Yechury that CPM leaders are doing all this to woo Hindu voters
 aisi pratikriyaayein bhi di gai ki sipiem kii ore se ‘hindu sabhyataa ke badhate rujhaan’ ko sweekaar karnaa he
 BJP ideologue s Gurumurthy retweeted the picture of Yechury and asked - 'will secular, liberal, atheist and Hindu intellectuals answer this?' CPM has not responded to the episode
 haalanki party sutron ne is tarah ke akshepon ko betuka bataate hue khaarij kiya he
 Yechury continued to be targeted on social media

 An attempt was made to contact Yechury but no response was received

 We spoke to the photographer of the Indo Asian News Service (IANS), who took pictures of the same occasion
 photographer ke mutabik ye bonalu hindu utsav maah kii shuruyaat thi
 Some women activists welcomed Yechury in a traditional way by placing an earthen pot on his head
 bonalu hindu utsav he jisamen devi mahakali kii puja kii jaati he
 According to the Bonalu custom, women take pucca rice, milk and jaggery in a clay or bronze pot to worship Mahakali
 chashmadid or sthaneey photographeron ke mutabik mahilaon ke aagrah paryechurine phulon kaa gamalaa sir par rakh liya
 Yechury neither participated in the Bonalu festival nor was it organized by BLF

 This is to tarnish our image

 Actor Jimmy Shergill, who came into the limelight from the films 'mohabbatein' and 'match', will soon be seen in director Neeraj Pandey's film 'special-26'
 is film main unke sah kalakaaron main akshay kumaar, anupam kher, kaajal agarwal or manoj vaajapeyi shaamil hai
 Jimmy Shergill told that the background of this film depicts a true incident
 yah ek tarah kii period film he jisamen assi ke dashak ke uttarardh main hui ek ghatana ko film kaa aadhaar banaaya gaya he
 At that time, there was a big scam of robbing a lot of people by becoming fake CBI
 maujuuda film is ghatana kii prishthbhumi main banaai gai he
 Jimmy told that in the film, Akshay Kumar plays a fake CBI officer while Manoj Vajpayee plays the real CBI officer
 meri bhoomika dilli ke ek sab inspector kii he jisane nayi nayi naukari shuru kii he or kuch kar guzarane kaa jajba rakhata he
 i want to catch the real culprit in any way
 unhone kaha ki unhone niraj pandey ke saath isse pehle film ‘vadensade’ main kaam kiya tha or unke kaam karne kaa tarika, kahani kaa chayan ityadi mujhe acha laga tha
 So when he proposed this new film, he did not hesitate to accept it
 jimi ne kaha ki film ‘special-26’ aath farvari ko relies hogi
 Much of the film has been shot in Delhi, highlighting the circumstances of the late 1980s
 film ke kuch hisse kii shooting dilli vishvavidhyalay ke north campus main jabaki baaki hisson kii shooting tughlaq road, conot place, chandani chowk jaise ilaakon main kii gai he
 On March 8, Jimmy's film 'saheb, Bibi Aur Gangster Return' will be released in which he has a lead role

 Apart from this, another film by Tigmanshu Dhulia, 'bullet Raja', will be released on September 6, in which Jimmy has played the important role
 film ke mukhya abhinayta saf ali khan hai
 Jimmy intends to make at least one Punjabi film every year and in the same sequence, he will have a Punjabi film 'rangeela' released in May starring Neha Dhupia
 jimi ko kala kii viraasat apane parivaar se mili he
 Perhaps few people know that Jimmy's father Satyajit Shergill is a great painter
 jimi kii nani amrutha shergill bharat kii prakhyat chitrakaar thim jinhen aadhunik chitrakala ke pranetaon main gina jaataa he
 Udupi Rajagopalacharya Ananthamurthy had created a sensation before the Lok Sabha elections by saying that if Narendra Modi became Prime Minister, i would not like to live in India
 iskaa nateeja yah niklaa ki jab 22 agast kii shaam hriday aghat se unki mrityu hui, to unase nafrat karne waalon main se kuch jashn manaane lage
 Many activists of the Bharatiya Janata Party and Hindu Jagran Vedike were also arrested in Mangalore and Chikmagalur on this charge
 fasebuk par bhi unki mrityu par khushi vyakt kii gai
 But these people did not even realize that Ananthamurthy was also a Hindu - a particular kind, trying to explain his tradition, a persistent cross-examination Hindu, who was a unique advocate of both Indianism and modernity
 is khabar ko dabaa diya gaya tha ki jab narendra modi pradhanmantri ban gaye, tab ananthamurti ne kaha-main or kahaan ja saktaa hum-bharat hi meraa ghar he; kyonki, yah ek parajeet vyakti kaa swar tha, jisase koi uttejnaa nahin paidaa hoti thi
 But in fact both of his statements were, in a sense, equally correct
 ek baat muhaavarey main kahi gai thi or duusari aasthaa kii apni bhashaa main
 But the idiom that was said, there was nothing else but faith
 yahi ananthamurti kii shakti thi-ve bhale hi angreji ke ‘‘bhadra’’ vaataavaran main jite the, par unamem apni jadon se katane kii koi aakanksha nahin thi
 They were not even worried that the English people should be in English and the Kannada people in Kannada
 unki angreji bhi, darasal, unki kannada kaa hi vistaar thi
 U
 after Phanishwanath Sranu
 aar
 Ananthamurthy is perhaps the second Indian narrator who recognized the centrality of caste in Hindu society so intensely
 jab 1965 main ve apane upanyaas sanskaar ke saath kannada ke sahitya kshitij par pragat hue, to ek dhamaakaa-sa hua
 The author himself was a Brahmin and was exposing the hypocrisy of Brahmin society with great vigor
 yah sahitya ke saath-saath ek saamaajik ghatana bhi thi
 This is the beginning of the "navya" movement in Kannada literature, which formed two classes of Kannada writers
 ek varg bhairappa jaise paramparawaadi lekhakon kaa jo vrahat saamaajik vrutt prastut karte hue bhi bhartiya samaaj main ubhar rahe anrtardvandvon ke sakshi bananaa nahin chaahate the or doosraa ananthamurti jaise lekhakon kaa jo nae or pragatisheel mulyon ke saath the
 a split could occur in Ananthamurthy's personality
 unhone britain kii barmingham uniwarsity se piechdi kii thi or bharat laut kar angreji ke professor ho gaye
 Later he was also a visiting professor of several Indian and foreign universities
 lekin likhnaa unhone kannada main hi jari rakhaa
 It has been said that the professor becomes a critic and there is no special place in the academic world for writers
 maano bauddhikta or rachanaatmakataa ke bich koi anivaary dwandv ho
 Ananthamurthy broke this duality and also became proof that what could be the ideal way to break it
 ananturti ko ‘‘public intelexual’’ ke rup main yaad kiya jaataa he, kyonki unka ek saarvajanik jivan bhi tha
 We can say that he was completely immersed in the reality of his time
 unki rachanaatmakataa unke bauddhik or lekhan karm main samaati nahin thi, isliye ve bangalore ko bangaloru ke liye bhi lade or loksabhaa or rajyasabha kaa chunaav bhi lade
 His status in Kannada society was like that of a respected elder, from whom any subject can be consulted
 bharat ke liye ve rishi-tulya the
 He held great positions
 1987 se 1991 tak ve kerala ke mahatma gandhi vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati rahe
 Became President of National Book Trust in 1992
 agle saal unhen dilli kii sahitya academy kaa adhyaksh chunaa gaya
 Became chairman of the Pune-based Film and Television Institute twice
 2012 main karnataka ke kendriya vishvavidhyalay ke kuladhipati banaae gaye
 Wherever he lived, he worked in a democratic way and thought less about himself, more about the institution
 pratishthan main rahete hue bhi ve pratishthanavaadee nahin the
 According to the constitution of the academy, its president is elected by an electoral college
 sarkaar is swaittata ko samaapt karnaa chaahati thi
 He proposed that a search committee should be formed to elect the president of the Sahitya Akademi in the same way as the vice-chancellor of universities
 ananthamurti ne yah prastaav thukraa kar sahityakaron ke swaraj ko bachaa liya
 He also created the tradition that the awards of the academy should be given by the president or any writer - ministers should not be harmed
 ananthamurti ne ek trupt jivan jiya, jisamen unke upanyaas the, kahani sangrah the, kavita sankalan the, aalochana kii pustaken thim or vaicharik lekhan tha, inke bhartiya tathaa videshi bhashaaon main anuwaad the, rashtriya or antarrashtriya parisanvaadon main bhagidaari thi, gyanpith sahit kai puraskaar the, samaajawaadee andolan main yogadan tha, saahitiyik or rajnatik mitra the or sukhi paariwarik jivan tha
 Before death he was drafting a new novel
 mujhe vishwaas he ki unki aakhri saans ek samgr or acha jivan jeene ke santosh se bhari rahi hogi

 Antarctica is a continent completely surrounded by ice
 yahaan kaa taapmaana hameshaa mines main rahata hai
 Although there are many ice glaciers in Antarctica, but there is also a mysterious glacier from which red water comes out
 isliye kaha jaataa tha blad falsiskaa naam tailor glacier he
 Taylor Glacier is located on the snow-capped surface at West Lake Bonney in the mcmurdo Dry Valleys of Victoria Land in East Antarctica
 ye glacier bada hi anokhaa glacier he
 Due to the red colored water, the glacier is also called blood falls by connecting it with blood
 ye pichley 106 saalo se ek rahasy bana hua tha
 However, scientists finally revealed the secret behind the red water coming out of the glacier 
 america ke colorado college kii purv snaatak chaatr jesica badgeley, uniwarsity of alaska kii himand vaigyanik arin petit or unki shodhakartaaon team ne milakar glacier main laal pani hone kii vajah khoj lee

 Which have been buried under this Taylor Glacier for many years
 shodhakartaaon ne mana ki ye pani jaise-jaise fries hota jaataa he, vaise-vaise wo garmi chodta jaataa hai
 This heat heats the ice from all sides
 isi prakriya ke kaaran ye rasinic kriyaayein ho rahi hai
 For this reason, red colored water is coming out of the glacier
 is anusandhan ko 2017 main sabit kiya gaya
 This glacier was first known to have been discovered in 1911 by Australian geologist Thomas Griffith Taylor of Australia
 iske baad grifffith tailor ne iske upar shodh shuru kar di thi
 According to their research, the color of the red water was due to the red colored algae which settled on the upper layer of the glacier
 isse glacier se bahane vaale pani kaa rang laal ho gaya tha
 Some people accepted this research as correct
 grifffith tailor apni is research kii theory ko sabit nahin kar paae, jisase unki theory fail ho gai
 After this, in 2003, the team of researchers started research on the water of this glacier again
 inaki shodh ke anusaar vajah ye bataai gai ki pani main louh namak kii maatra adhik hone ke kaaran glacier se pighalane vaala pani kaa rang laal ho gaya hai
 This research was a small percentage, but it was not the real reason

 raajnneeti main karunanidhi kii entry dravid andolan ke jariye hui or yaheen se unhone aisi pahchaan banaai jo aaj tak kaayam rahi or unako chunauti de paanaa vipakshiyon ke liye behad mushkil rahaa
 The Dravidian movement began to attack religious beliefs, Brahminical thought and Hindu evils

 He attacked the life-long Brahminical thinking and Hindu evils
 yahaan tak ki manusmriti jaise hindu dharmagranthon ko jalaayaa bhi
 The DMK (dravida Munnetra Kadagam) adopted the idea of periyar through the Dravidian movement in Tamil Nadu and made a place in politics
 periyar ne 1944 main dravid kadgam kaa gathan kiya, lekin 1949 main periyar ke behad kareebi sien annadurai kaa unke saath matbhed ho gaya
 Annadurai founded the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on 17 September 1949

 After the death of CN Annadurai in 1969, Karunanidhi took command of the DMK and remained its head for 50 years

 Karunanidhi grew up in the Dravidian movement against radical Hinduism and became a symbol of it throughout the state
 saath hi hindi bhashaa kaa jamkar virodh kiya
 At the age of just 14, he entered politics with an anti-hindi plank
 1937 main skulon main hindi ko anivaary karne par badi sankhya main yuvaaon ne virodh kiya, karunanidhi bhi unamem se ek the
 He then made the Tamil language his weapon and began writing scripts for plays, newspapers and films in Tamil
 is bich unhone dravid raajnneeti se jude ek chaatr sanghathan kaa gathan bhi kiya tha
 Then in 1965, an agitation against Hindi started in Tamil Nadu to protest against the announcement of making Hindi the only official language of the country, which Karunanidhi led and achieved success
 hindi ke khilaaf rajyavyapee virodh pradarshan ke dauraan karunanidhi or unke samarthakon ne railway stesan se hindi naam ko mitaa diya or ve log railgadiyon ke maarg ko avaruddh karne ke liye patari par let gaye
 Two people also lost their lives in this violent protest, and Karunanidhi was arrested
 yaheen se wo bade netaa ke rup main aage bad gaye
 Karunanidhi became the MLA of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly for the first time in 1957 and in 1967 he came to power and was made the Minister of Public Works
 1969 main annadurai ke nidhan ke baad pehali baar rajya ke mukhyamantri bane
 After the death of Osama bin-laden, possibly the world's most wanted terrorist, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the war against terrorism was not yet over after his death
 iske alaava unhone taliban se kaha ki vah khud ko al-kaayda se alag karke shantipurna raajnneetik prakriya main shariq ho
 Describing Osama's death as a 'milestone', Hillary said, 'our message to the Taliban is still the same and today its resonance has become more widespread
 tum (taliban) hamen haraa nahin sakate or na hi hamen or zyada intjaar kara sakate ho
 But you can choose to leave al-qaeda and join the peaceful political process
 ’unhone kaha ki aatanki sanghathan ke khilaaf sangharsh jari rahegaa or pakistan sahit antarrashtriya samudaay ke saath america sahyog karata rahegaa
 The Center has no plans to form another State Reorganization Commission and impose President's rule in Andhra Pradesh

 'he wrote,' i would request that instead of taking a hasty step on this matter, you kindly send a white paper on the subject to all political parties, asking them to express their views
 iske liye unhen paryaapt samay diya jaae
 If you do this, then only we will be able to give concrete suggestions on this important subject

 ek sarkari yojana ke tahat mazdooron or zaruratmandon ko muft vitaran ke liye rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ne lakhon kii taadaad main cycilen kharidi thim
 Bicycles were also distributed in many districts, but there are still many districts where thousands of bicycles lying in warehouses turned into junk
 jashpur main ek aise hi godaam kaa khulaasa hua jahaan chaar hajaar do sau cycilen kabad ban gai hai
 After the disclosure of the case, the government has ordered an inquiry
 chhattisgarh ke adivasee bahulya jashpur jile ke livelihud college parisar main sthit is godaam main rakhi cycilen dinon din kabad main tabdeel hoti ja rahi hai
 Seven thousand eight hundred bicycles were purchased for this district of a well-known company, so that they could be provided to the needy, but out of these only 3600 bicycles could be distributed
 shesh 4 hajaar 200 cycilen laavaaris haalat main yahaan rakhi hui hai
 The state labor department was responsible for providing these bicycles to laborers and the needy, but the labor department officials showed no interest in its distribution
 salbhar pehle unhone 3600 cycilen vitarit kin
 After that, he did not even turn to his warehouse
 natijatan hajaaron cycilen kabad main tabdeel ho gayi
 Hundreds of bicycles became rusty
 shram vibhaag ke afasaron se jab is bare main poocha gaya to ve lipapoti main jute gaye
 On the other hand, after the revelation of the case, the Congress has accused the BJP government of the state of wastage of government money and negligence in the implementation of the schemes
 congress pravaktaa shailesh nitin trivedi ke mutabik bijepi ne sasti lokapriyata paane ke liye is yojana ko taiyaar kiya tha, isliye afasaron ne bhi ise gambhirtha se lagu nahin kiya
 As a result, crores of crores were lost
 idhar sarkari pravaktaa or vidhayak shrichand sundarani ne kaha ki maamle ke saamne aane ke baad jaanch ke nirdesh die gaye hai
 He claimed that strict action would be taken against the officers who were negligent
 chhattisgarh main sirf jashpur main hi nahin balki rajya ke duusare or jilon main cycle vitaran yojana kaa yahi haal he
 The state government had vigorously implemented the Saraswati Cycle Yojana to distribute free bicycles to laborers and needy people besides school children
 prayek jile main kahin shram vibhaag ko to kahin tribal welfare vibhaag ko iske vitaran kii javaabadari saunpi gai thi
 These bicycles were purchased directly from companies to avoid the profits of an agency
 cycle kharidi main koi agency yaa bichauliyon ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya tha
 So that the bicycles can be made available to the government at a lower price than the market price
 lekin is tarah se godaamon main padi cykilon ke barbaadi se sarkaar kii manshaa par pani phir gaya
 The Congress has accused the BJP government of wasting government money on the bad condition of bicycle distribution scheme
 udhar sarkari godaam main cykilon kii barbaadi kaa maamla saamne aane ke baad sarkaar ne afasaron ko aade haathon liya he
 The government has prima facie termed it as negligence of officers and has also directed the investigation of the case
 chhattisgarh main cycilen aaj bhi pasand kii jaati hai
 Whether it is tribal area or common rural area, the first choice of people is still a bicycle
 lihaaja sarkaar ne mehanatakash mazdooron or schuli bacchon ke liye cycle vitaran yojana taiyaar kii or ise jor-shor se lagu bhi kiya

 He said, 'if the BJP will take support of those who have declared saffron terrorism, half-tiled people and Ishrat Jahan innocent

 The discussion will continue, but we have decided
 vipaksh kaa netaa hamaara hi hoga
