 newjiland daure par gai england kii team oakland ke maidan par mejabaan team ke khilaaf pehla test match khel rahi he
 But on the very first day of this Test match, such a shameful record has been registered against the visiting team, which he would not have even imagined
 darasal, england kii team ne pehle test ke pehle hi seshan main trent bolt or tim soudi kii ghaatak gendbaaji ke saamne sarender kar diya or wo mahaj 58 ranon par ol out ho gai
 England's team is just 20
 4 over main ol out ho gai or uske 5 ballebaaj khaataa tak nahin khol sake
 This is the lowest England team score in the last 130 years in englandtest cricket, which was dismissed after 130 years at such a low score
 isse pehle england kii team saal 1888 main australia ke khilaaf lords ke maidan par mahaj 53 ranon par olout ho gai thi
 But the revenge taken from New Zealand, let me tell you that in the year 1955, England had piled New Zealand for just 26 runs on this Auckland ground
 tab newjiland kii team sirf 27 over hi ballebaaji kar pai thi
 But today, 63 years later, New Zealand completed their revenge by bowling England out for 58 and the ground of Auckland became its witness
 test cricket main sabase nunatam score 26 ran he, jo aaj bhi newjiland ke naam he
 For New Zealand, Trent Boult took 6 and Tim Southee took 4 wickets
 england kii puri team sirf 20
 He was dismissed in 4 overs
 england ke 9 wicket sirf 27 ran par gir gaye the or us par test cricket main apane sabase nunatam score par ol out hone kaa khatra mandara rahaa tha, lekin craig overton kii 33 ranon kii pari ne england ko is sharmnaak record se bachaa liya
 When it comes to England's lowest score of Test innings so far, their poor score has been against Australia
 janvari, 1887 main sidney main khele gaye test match main england ne australia ke khilaaf keval 45 ran banaae the
 Also in 1994 he scored 46 against the West Indies
 vaise test cricket main sabase kam score kii baat karen to yah record newjiland ke naam darj he
 In 1955, New Zealand scored just 26 runs against England
 vahiin is list main doosraa sthaan south africa kaa he, jisne 1896 main england ke khilaaf 30 ran banaae the

 i am not saying that they should be punished but they should take note of their statements themselves
 sansad main aap jo kuch bhi bolte hai, uskaa aapako kaaphi khyaal rakhana chahie

 He has asked farmers to use only neem coated urea and to get new crop insurance to increase their income
 unhone yah bhi ghoshnaa kii ki sabhi kisaanon ko 2017 tak mrudaa swasthya card milegaa
 Addressing a farmers rally as part of bjp's nationwide campaign to reach farmers, the Prime Minister said that earlier there was black marketing of urea and farmers had to face lathicharge to acquire urea, but now the situation has changed
 sarkaar ne utpaadan badhaane or uria ke diverjan par ankush lagane par dhyaan kendrit kiya he
 Modi said that he has not received any letter from the states this year seeking fertilizer
 unhone kaha, hamane bhrashtachar or uria kii kalabazari ko khatm karne ke liye bada kadam uthaaya he
 That is why some of these people keep shouting against me

 The government has focused on increasing production and curbing diversion of urea

 How is the decision of the Supreme Court, before you answer, people themselves say that let's end the ruckus
 lekin tab bhi pehla sawaal to rah hi jaataa he ki faisla kaisaa tha
 It is indeed a matter of appreciation that the public faced it with restraint and maturity
 wo janata yah bhi jaananaa chaahegi ki faisla kaisaa he
 She does not panic due to the verdict of the verdict
 aam sahmati se aae is faisle ko jab kanoon kii class main padhaayaa jayega tab shaayad hi chaatro ke bich aam sahmati ban paaegi
 It is a historic decision, so it will not be reviewed today, but will be for a long time
 aitihaasik faisla, aam sahmati kaa faisla lekin koun sa hissaa kiskaa likhaa he, yah anupasthit he
 Live law has stated that this never happened in the history of the Supreme Court
 ab dekhie 2017 main niztaa ke adhikaar par 9 jajon ne faisla diya
 Consensus was decided but the first page shows which part is written by which judge
 isi maamle main elahabaad hai court ne 8000 se adhik pannon kaa tha, ganimat he ki supreme court kaa faisla use aath guna kam 1045 pannon kaa he
 It will take less hard work, but it would be good that you also read this decision yourself
 kaaphi kuch jaanane ko milegaa
 Only the Supreme Court allows that its decision can be reviewed
 court se bhi faisle kii samiksha kaa aagrah kiya ja saktaa he or saamaanya jan bhi apni charchaaon main faisle kii samiksha kar sakate hai
 Just you cannot say that because of which this judge would have written so, if you add intention then you will have to face contempt
 aam taur par rajaneta tay karte hai ki supreme court ke kis faisle par raajnneeti karenge or kis par nahin
 In the Babri Masjid Ram Janmabhoomi decision, the court's decision was fortunate that all political parties said that we will not do politics
 sweekaar karenge
 But when the Supreme Court verdict regarding Sabarimala came in 2018, then the BJP stood with the people opposing this decision
 nahin kaha ki ham supreme court ke faisle kaa samarthan karte hai
 On this decision, the statement of Home Minister Amit Shah is that we are with those protesting against this decision
 amit shah ne twit kiya tha ki sabarimala ke maamle main raashtra ne dharm, vishwaas or bhakthi or kerala kii damankaaree sarkaar ke bich ladaai dekhi he
 The government is using its power to suppress the devotees of Ayyappa
 tab amit shah ne nahin kaha tha ki ve supreme court ke saath hai
 It was not said then that the Government of Kerala should implement the decision of the Supreme Court
 jabaki sabarimala kaa faisla 5 jajon kii bench ne diya tha
 a female judge expressed her disagreement
 ab ye faisla bhi phir se 5 jajon kii bench ke saamne samiksha ke liye prastut he
 In March 2018, in the case of Scheduled Castes and Tribes Act, the Supreme Court ruled that no public servant would be arrested without investigation
 is faisle ke khilaaf bharat band ho gaya
 It killed 11 people
 anusuchit jati ke saansadon kaa dabaav bana or sarkaar ko sansad ke bheetar is faisle ko badalanaa padaa
 Now this decision has been changed by the Supreme Court
 do jajon ke bench ke faisle ko teen jajon kii bench ne badal diya
 When political parties say that the decision of the Supreme Court is not to do politics, then it is their politics
 isliye faisle kii samiksha karnaa ek paripakv loktantr kii nishaani he
 The Supreme Court has started the operative part of its decision with Justice, Equity and Good Congress which was discussed by Sunni Waqf Board lawyer Rajiv Dhawan during the debate
 faisla justise equity or good kanshiens kii utpatti kaa lanbaa itihaas bataata he
 It started from Rome
 baad main 16 veen sadi main angrezon ke banaae kanoon main ghul mil gaya
 No Hindi channel came to know that otherwise the headline would make that Rome came to Ram's work and audience Ram's work came to Rome
 vaise justise equity or good kanshiens kaa siddhant isliye apanaaya gaya kyonki nyaay kaa yah siddhant jajon ko avasar detaa he ki jab kisi vishesh paristhiti main kanoon aparyaapt ho, kaaphi nahin ho, tab nyaay, barabari or achche vivek ke aadhaar par faisle liye ja sakate hai
 For this, it is not a mistake to look at the basis of decisions taken in other countries
 yah bataane kaa makasad yahi he ki maujuuda maamle main bhi bahut se pahalu aise hai jo maujuud kanoon ke paimaane par feet nahin hote hai
 Are there really many aspects of this case that our current laws did not have enough capacity to deal with? This is a question, but we do not have the answer
 faisle main ise rekhaankit kiya gaya he ki 4 sadiyon kaa yah jhagada he is bich bharat main mughalon kaa raaj rahaa, east india company kaa raaj rahaa, british hukumat kaa raaj rahaa or phir azaad bharat kaa samvidhan lagu hua
 The disputed complex has been on the land of Nazul since 1861 i
e
 government land
 sarkaar kii taraf se kabhi daawa nahin kiya gaya ki zamin hamaari he
 In the revenue records of 1861, 1893-94 and 1936-37, this place has been called the birthplace
 rajasav record main masjid, shahi masjid yaa janmasthan masjid kaa zikr nahin he
 The evidence that the mosque was on the ground dates back to the Awadh Annexation of 1856
 1856 ke pehle kaa koi shahi farmaan pesh nahin kiya ja sakaa
 It was then argued that since there was namaz there, it would be considered the land of Waqf
 is baat kii adaalat kai faislon se jaanch karti he
 Looks at how the verdict has been rendered in such a case
 adaalat kahati he ki tab dekha jaataa he ki us jagah kaa istamaal namaaz yaa ibaadat ke liye ho rahaa tha yaa nahin
 On this basis, in many cases such decisions have been given that it will then be considered as Waqf land
 court kahati he ki 1528 se 1856 ke bich namaaz hone kaa pramaan pesh nahin kiya ja sakaa
 Therefore, it cannot be said that its use was being religious
 1856 main jab railing banati he tab zamin kaa maalik koun he, isaki daavedaari koi nahin karata he
 During the British, the British recognized the religious right of the Hindus in the outer complex
 musalamaanon ne bhi bahari parisar par daawa nahin kiya
 Nor were they using it after 1857
 court ke faisle ko lekar sawaal do pahalu par ho rahe hai
 The Allahabad High Court had asked the ASI whether the Babri Masjid was built on vacant land or there was a structure earlier
 ASI ne apni report main nahin bataaya ki mandir gira kar masjid banaai gai thi yaa nahin
 The ASI stated that under the ground remains of old buildings that resemble temples
 ASI ne kaha ki in avasheshon ke nirmaan kaa samay 12veen sadi kaa lagata he
 The court says that it is not clear from the ASI report that the 12th century structure was used in the mosque
 ASI ne yah zarur kaha he ki khaali zamin par masjid nahin bani thi
 The court believes that archaeological evidence does not prove that the Hindu temple was destroyed for the mosque
 yah is raajnneeti kaa sabase bada jhooth tha jise adaalat ne apane faisle main saaf kar diya
 There was so much uproar in North India in the name of breaking the temple and building a mosque, but this was not proved in the Supreme Court
 supreme court ke faisle kaa ek hissaa or mahatvapurn he
 There is evidence that the Namaz was performed on 16 December 1949
 22 / 23 disambar 1949 kii darmyaani raat vahaan murti rakh di gai jiske baad se namaaz par roak lag gai
 The Muslims were not evicted from this place on the basis of law but were deliberately evicted from the Ibadatgah
 adaalat ne apane faisle main is par insaaf zarur diya ki 22-23 disambar 1949 kii raat gaiyr kanoonee tareeke se masjid main murti rakhi gai
 Shouldn't the court then say that the independent Indian courts took a stand on this incident, whether it was illegal and gave a decision in favor of the Muslims
 nahin diya
 Rather, when the order to remove the statue was given, the district administration refused to remove the statue
 agar yah ninsaphi thi to insaaf kya hona chahie tha
 The Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992
 agar yah imaarat nahin tuutati to phir is mukademe kaa kya faisla hota, is par sochaa hi ja saktaa he
 But the Supreme Court has given a decision on this incident with the same consensus as the consensus has decided the issue
 6 disambar 1992 ko masjid kaa dhaancha tod diya gaya
 The mosque was demolished in violation of the status quo order
 adaalat ko aashwaasan diya gaya ki yathasthiti rahegi
 The demolition of the mosque was an open violation of the rule of law
 supreme court ke is faisle main yah do faisle behad mahatvapurn hai
 Thousands of people and many big leaders were involved in this work or were present at the time of demolishing the mosque, all of them were also active in the movement related to the construction of Ram temple
 kya ve bhi supreme court ke faisle kaa swaagat kar rahe hai, jabaki supreme court ne us kaam ko gaiyr kanoonee mana he
 Ram Maryada is considered Purushottam
 ayodhya main faisla mandir ke haq main aayaa he jahaan samvidhan kii maryaadaayen 1949 main or 1992 main dhwast kii gayi
 The decision of the temple has come under the same constitution
 dekha jaae to wo saare apradhi is vakt kahaan hoge, wo apane is krity ke bare main kya soch rahe honge, kya ve ram ko yaad karte hue khud se adaalat ke saamne aa jaaenge ki unase yah gunaah hua tha
 Will such people also be in the trust that has to be formed by order of the Supreme Court
 jo kanoon ke apradhi hai, bhale pakade nahin gaye hai, ve mandir nirmaan se judi kisi prakriya main kaise shaamil ho sakate hai? april 2017 main supreme court ne hi masjid dhwast ke maamle main aadesh diya tha ki do saal ke bheetar trial puraa ho
 Two years have been completed
 vivaadit zamin ek sampurna ikai he
 The railing was built in 1856–57 but no land or ownership was divided

 Carbon dating can only occur if it contains carbon content
 ramalala kii taraf se kaha gaya ki devtaa kii carbon dating nahi hui he
 The hearing in the Supreme Court on the Ayodhya case will continue on Monday
 ramalala virajman kii taraf se sies vaidyanathan ne kaha ki somvaar ko ve eesai kii report par bahes karne ke baad gavaahon ke bayanon par paksh rakhenge

 aaj lekhak ramkumar singh kaa janmdin he
 He was born on 17 September 1975 in Birania, Fatehpur Shekhawati, Rajasthan
 vah ek achche patakatha lekhak, geetkaar, sine-samalochak ke rup main janaa pahachaanaa naam he
 The Rajasthani film 'bhobhar', based on his story, has gained a new place of popularity in many national and international film festivals
 vahiin 'zed plus' upanyaas par film bani kaaphi safal rahi
 The protagonist of the novel 'Z Plus' is Aslam Puncherwala
 use gafalat main jed sicurity mil jaati he
 After getting z security, there is an earthquake in his life
 desh ke sarvocch suraksha-ghere main jakadaaa hua asalam samaj nahin paata ki ye uske liye vardaan he yaa abhishaap
 Screwdriver, interesting and thrilling at the same pace as thriller novels, this novel is a serious and government-conscious departure point for popular Hindi writing in its presentation
 aaj lekhak ramkumar singh ke janmdin par sahitya tak par padhein unki isi pustak kaa ansh
 Book excerpt: z plus Prime Minister's visit, quarrel with Habib Mian, scooter theft and now Aslam Mian, who is in z security, may not remember Saida in this escape
 par mushkil duusari thi
 He was in security to say but Aslam was guarded round the clock
 raju panwari kii dukaan par janaa tak chhot gaya tha
 It was also not known what has happened in the city in these past days
 jab colector ko usne apni dukaan tode jane kii shikaayat kii thi tabhi se uski dukaan waapas sahi karvaa di gai thi lekin samasya ab duusari ho gai
 It was a city of modest people
 ve board to dekhte asalam pankcharavaala, lekin ruke koun, jab ve dekhte ki dukaan ke baahar police kii do gaadiyaan khadi hai
 Two bikes are parked
 das gyaarah vardidhari baahar paharaa de rahe hai
 The business started coming to a standstill
 iskaa ulat hamida ke saath hua
 The women subscribed to his shop
 ve din-bhar hamida se batiyaane ke bahaane dhundhatin or lage haath juutiyaan bhi bik hi jaatin
 Aslam also had a bicycle at his shop, he would have to undergo a security check
 rajesh ko hameshaa shaq rahata ki jisane dhamkee di he vah asalam kii hatya cycle bam se bhi kar saktaa he
 Aslam decided that he would no longer sit at Puncture's shop
 usne hamida se baat kii
 On this matter, a quarrel between Hamida and Aslam started growing
 hamida har roj kisi na kisi baat par pradhanmantri ko bhala-bura kahati
 Aslam would tell him, what is the fault of the Prime Minister? They have done everything for good
 ab itane dinon tak logon ko baar-baar kehete hue asalam ko sachmuch lagane laga tha jaise use pakistan se dhamkee mili he
 When he said this in front of Hamida, Hamida shouted, "muay, you have given up everything, you will beat Pakistan from above
 isse acha to maar hi daale tuje
 This way, it would seem that he died
 ab bachche mujhe hi paalane hai
 "sayida is not like this
 vah baat kitne pyaar se karti he
 How good Hamida would have been if Iqbal had a wife
 donon kaa swabhaav kitna miltaa he
 My nature is found only by Saeeda
 lekin asalam nai samasya main bhi funs rahaa tha
 Which he was going to realize now
 saidaa is baat se naaraaz thi ki itane din hue asalam ne khabar hi nahin lee
 Throughout the day, Saeeda Raju, sitting at the bangles shop, kept looking towards the Panwadi shop to see that her forgotten Harjai might remember her Saida
 tadap baraabar kii thi
 Aslam Mian used to remember Saida daily but now Jade was surrounded by security
 vah himmat nahin juta paa rahaa tha ki jed suraksha ke saath saidaa ke ghar jaaya jaae
 After all, secretly getting involved is a different thing
 is puure tamzam ko vahaan le jane kaa sidhaa arth tha ki puure mohalle main, puure kasbe main or usase bhi zyada khatarnaak hamida ko yah pataa chalanaa ki uski ek sautan uske pati ke pahalu main he
 He would tremble with mere imagination
 lekin ishk karne vaale kya kabhi rukate hai? asalam miyaan ne man hi man sochaa
 Away from the taunts of this Bhagdor and Hamida, he wanted peace for a day
 ''chaahe kuch bhi ho jaae, aaj kii raat main saidaa se milane jaaoongaa
 Aslam had decided his mind
 asalam kii haalat ek bandhak jaisi ho gai
 From birth till today, he could not remember that he ever lived in so many bonds
 vah jab kabhi nikalne ko hota to uske jed security had captain rajesh kaa vah aagrah yaad aa jaataa ki kam se kam aadha ghante pehle un logon ko soochna di jaae, taaki ve log apni taiyaari kar saken
 In the early days, Aslam was ready to go, he used to give information
 asalam apana lambretta scooter uthaata or uske aage sicurity ke do biker or peeche ek gypsy chalati
 Mustaid would have been a soldier on these
 bike infield kii thi or start hone ke saath hi puure mohalle ko yah pataa chal jaataa tha ki asalam miyaan ab bazaar ja rahe hai
 Just behind it was a dark green gypsy with a hole in the middle of the roof
 uske saamne vaale kaanch par ek lohe kii jaali lagi hoti thi
 a man stood up with his mouth out of the hole in the roof
 uske chehre par kaale rang kaa ek scorf bandhaa hota tha
 The black-colored army looked like a topper
 yah scorf baandh lene ke baad vah or bhi majboot or daraavna dikhne lagata tha
 No one is able to see that even with the eye on Aslam Mian running behind the bike and in front of the gypsy
 kabhi bazaar main bheed hoti to gypsy vaala syran bhi baja detaa
 Among the locals, there was a fear that ever Aslam Mian saw the ceiling carefully and if any security personnel caught sight of him, he would have to be a victim of a surefire bullet
 yah dar anayas nahin aayaa tha
 This fear started from the shop of Raju Panwadi
 har baat main apane aapako gyani samajhanevaale raju panwari ne us din jed suraksha par apana puraa gyaan dene kii koshish kii thi
 He tried to provoke Sharif Mian while sipping the paan, "you have also served the dargah? You did not receive any threat
 "''ek number kaa golibaz he
 Me know he did not receive any threat

 Just come now go soon what is the power na chhoduunga main jaisi chaahe tum mujh se qasam le lo- amir minaayina ruuthana naa manaanaa, naa gilaa naa shikawa kar, If you want to fall, then just flirt, why do you feel irritation in the eyes without worrying, is aashiqui main har aadmi pareshaan kyon hota hausi se puch lo uske ishk kii keemat, We were just sold on trust, if love is a crime, then it is a crime jisane banaaya dil kisi par aane ke liekuch ajab haal he in dinon tabiyat kaa sahab, Don't feel happy and don't feel bad, my soul has become a slave, maybe in your love, varanaa yun chatapataana, meri aadat to naa thiehsaas-e-muhabbat ke liye That's enough tere bagaiyr bhi ham, tere hi rahete hai

 bhakton kii aasthaa se is desh main saikadon baar khelaa gaya he
 And right now, even in which corner of the country, which Baba is playing with the devotees
 magar tamaam bundalbaaz, dhokhebaaz or gurughantal baabaaon ke bich dilli se ye jo nayaa baba saamne aayaa he isane to kamaal hi kar diya
 The shop that was decorated in the name of religion and faith turned out to be a complete shop
 log khod ashu maharaj ko rahe the or maharaj main se nikal aayaa asif khan
 Yes yes gangrape ke ilzaam main fanse jis ashu maharaj ko dilli police dar-dar dhundh rahi he
 His real name is actually Asif Khan
 jise duniya vishwavikhyath jyotishcharya
 Granting a handwriting expert and a master of black magic, the category was bowing down
 wo baba to sir se lekar paanv tak dagaabaaz niklaa
 There is no molestation of a woman and her baby girl
 balki apane hazaron lakhon bhakton kii aasthaa ke saath khilwaad kiya hyaashu bhai gurujine
 Asif Khan turned out to be Ashu Bhai, who was believed to be a devotee of Ashu Bhai Guruji and was leading the steps
 wo darasal asif khan he
 And its testimony is giving the voter list
 jis par aashu bhai guruji kii tasviir lagi he or uske aage likhaa hua he asif khan putr shri idaha khan
 There is no scope of mistake in the voter list because the picture of Samar Khan, son of Asif Khan, living at the same address, is also located below it
 bhakton kii aasthaa se khilavaadyani ek musalmaan hone ke baavjood asif khan aashu bhai guruji banakar bhakton kii aasthaa se khilwaad karata rahaa
 Then the question is, why did Asif Khan become Ashu Bhai Guruji
 to iskaa jawaab asif khan kaa itihaas degaa
 According to the information received by Aaj Tak, Ashu Bhai Guruji started his own business in the year 1990 by becoming Asif Khan
 asif khan kaise bana aashu bhai guruji?aashu 1990 tak dilli ke vajirpur kii jeje colony main rahata tha
 But by the year 2018, he became the owner of crores
 aashu ke paas sirf karodon rupee hi nahin balki kai mahangi kaaren bhi hai
 Started his business in Padam Nagar area of sarai Rohilla
 aashu bhai guruji ne dusron kaa bhavishya bataane kaa dhandha shuru kiya
 Soon Ashu Bhai Guruji had to stop his business
 kyonki aashu ke ghar kaa naukar uske 50 lakh rupee lekar bhaag gaya tha
 Starts from Rohini area a loss of 50 lakhs in the early days forced Ashu to stop the business from Padam Nagar
 magar ab asif khan urf aashu bhai ko ye palle pad gaya tha ki khud kaa bhavishya bhale kaisaa ho magar dusron kaa bhavishya bataane main phayda bada he
 So after leaving Padam Nagar, Ashu Bhai started his business again in Rohini area
 karodon kii sampatti kaa maalik he aashu bhaiaashu bhai kaa bhavishya bataane kaa ye dhandha itnaa phala phula ki ab alam ye he ki dilli ke kai ilaakon main baba kii karodon kii praparty he
 In which the house in Tarun Enclave of Pritam Pura
 rohinee secoter 7 main ashram or south dilli ke hauzakhaas jaise posh ilaake main offis he
 Moreover, Baba had now increased his business so much that he even went to an Ayurvedic doctor
 jahaan ilaaj bhi khud karata tha or dawaaen bhi khud banaata tha
 Meaning once the cock got stuck, this Baba used to suck his blood even
 aashu bhai ne bhi kii duusare baabaaon jaisi galatipaisa kamaane tak to thik tha
 But with earning money, Ashu Bhai Guruji alias Asif Khan made the same mistake as before by other babas like Asaram Bapu, Gurmeet Ram Rahim, Virendra Dixit
 yanimahila bhaktonki asmat se khilwaad
 And Ashu Bhai Guruji got trapped here
 mahila ne darj karai reportgaziabad kii rahane vaali peedit mahila kii taharir par poxo act ke tahat maamla darj kar police guruji kii talash main unke tamaam sambhavit thikaanon par danaadan dabish daal rahi he
 Till yesterday, Guruji, who had been sitting on the throne and telling people his future, is getting less land to flee
 ummid he ki jald hi ye baba bhi vahiin jaaenge jahaan farzi baabaaon kii jamaat pehle hi pahunch chuki he
 The business of telling the future: By now, it was understood that Asif Khan had become his brother in the pursuit of earning money
 magar usne yejyotishavidya or hastrekha sikhi kahaan se
 Although this disclosure will be possible only after the arrest of Asif, but it is revealed in the initial investigation that when he realized that this business of telling luck could change his fate, he first learned the nuances and then changed the name with complete preparation Asif alias Ashu Bhai Guruji jumped into this business
 haujakhaas thane main darj hui firsaba kuch sahi chal rahaa tha
 Baba had become a king in the last 25 years from the rank
 usne karodon arabon kii praparty khadi kar lee
 Till then it was fine
 magar jaise hi usne bhakton kii bhakthi kaa beja phayda uthaanaa shuru kiya
 His siren of bad times started ringing
 magar use ye aahat sunai nahin de rahi thi
 And that victimized woman of Ghaziabad was constantly being exploited
 yahaan tak usne mahila ke beti se bhi chhedchhad kii
 The intoxication of strength was on his head
 magar is khumaar ko hauz khaas thane main darj hui is exiaar ne utaar diya

 The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee has claimed that Sajjan Kumar is threatening the witnesses who were witness to the riots

 After receiving the complaint, the committee has written a letter to Delhi Police Commissioner Alok Kumar Verma, demanding the security of the witnesses
 ab dilli sikh gurudwara prabandhak cameti ne gavaahon ko prabhavit karne ke aarope main sajjan kumaar ko police remand par lene ke liye adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhatane kaa faisla bhi kiya hai
 Jaswinder Singh Jolly, co-chairman of the committee's legal department, told 'aaj Tak' that before the witnesses, he was also tried to bully them through an anonymous letter about four months ago
 dhamkee bhare patr main joli ko1984 sikh katleamke keson kii pairvi se peeche hatane kii hidaayat dhamkeekarta dwaara di gai thi
 He said that the committee had also informed the Delhi Police about receiving threatening letters

 Threatening to the witnesses' house, Jauli informed the complainant that the former Congress MLA from Sultanpuri, his brother Vedprakash and his sons had knocked at Joginder Singh's house at midnight for the last 3-4 consecutive days on September 7
 During the hearing, instructions are being given not to testify
 gavaahi dene kii halaat main joginder singh or uske parivaar ko katl karne kii bhi dhamkee di gai he
 Similarly, Prem Kaur and Mishri Kaur have also come to know about the threat of 5-6 masked people of Sajjan Kumar coming to their house for the last 4 days
 '1984 dange chunavi nahin, bhaavnaatmak mudda'joli ne saaf kaha ki cameti kaum ke kaatilon ko sajaa dilaane ke liye vachanabaddh he par yah sajaa gavaahon ko suraksha mili bina pukhta taur par nahin ho sakati he
 Jolly, responsible for the prosecution of the murderers, has not been responsible for prosecuting the murderers openly for 32 years
 joli ne talkh lahaze main kaha ki jab cameti ne peediton or gavaahon ko sanbhaalane kii koshishen aarambh kii thim, to hamaari koshishon ko kuch logon dwaara chunaav main siyaasi phayda lene ke taur par bataaya gaya tha
 While the 1984 slaughter for the Akali Dal is not an issue related to Sikh sentiment, rather than an electoral issue, so if the murderer goes to jail, there cannot be a greater victory for him

 He said that the attacks on the internal bases of the army show that there is increasing fanaticism inside the army and that there is a danger of nuclear weapons going into the hands of the fundamentalists
 parmaanu bhautikee ke vaigyanik or raksha vishleshak hudbhoy ne kaha ki pakistan ke paas bharat kii tarah hi kareeb 120 se 130 aayudh hai
 He was answering questions from members of the Indian Journalists Association at the Indali Lounge here last evening
 unhone kaha ‘purv main aise hathiyaar keval pratirohak upayon ke taur par dekhe jate the
 But the most dangerous thing is the increasing discovery of such weapons material which has brought a new aspect of nuclear war
 iskaa matlab he ki hathiyaaron kii sankhya main teji se badhottaree ho rahi he
 Hoodbhoy, who holds a phd in nuclear physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said the issue needed to be resolved for the sake of sub-continental and global security
 vaigyanik ne kaha ki bharat or pakistan kam se kam paanch baar parmaanu yuddh ke kagaar par pahunch chuke the
 In 1987, in the year 1990, during the Kargil war (1999), after the attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001 and the Mumbai attacks in 2008, the two countries were very close to nuclear war
 hudbhoy ne kaha ki parmaanu yuddh ke kaaran utpann hone vaale tanaav ko dekhte hue ham is mudde par yathasthiti nahin bane rahane de sakate
 After the explosion, radioactivity has a terrible effect, which will affect not only the subcontinent but also the whole world

 It is a collection of essays from scientists on both sides of the border
 parmaanu yug main bharat main isaki shuruuaat 1974 main hui jiske baad pakistan ne isamen pravesh kiya
 In 1998, after nuclear tests, a nuclear weapons race started
 hudbhoy ne kaha ‘pakistan ne isliye parmaanu hathiyaar viksit karnaa shuru kiya kyonki bharat aisa kar rahaa tha
 India remains the main enemy
 lekin is dharna main (pakistan kii sena ke pramukh) general kayaani ke is haalia kathan se badlaav prathit hota he ki pakistan kii sabase badi chunauti uske hi andar maujuud shatru hai
 "the scientist said that this indicates a change in the Army's thinking", but Kayani too could not escape criticism in the army
 ’ hudbhoy ne mana ki khud unhen bhi jaan se maar daalane kii dhamkiyaan mil rahi hai
 He said 'jihadis are active in Pakistan and the state's policy regarding Islamic forces is unclear
 ’ pakistani parmaanu pratishthanon ke khilaaf bolne ke liye charchit hudbhoy lahore uniwarsity of management sciensej (aluames) ke bhautikee vibhaag main visiting professor hai
 He is also skeptical about the peaceful use of nuclear technology in India and Pakistan
 unhone kaha ‘sabase bada sawaal he ki kya parmaanu sroton se sachmuch bijli utpaadan hoga

 He said that soon after coming to power, his government has taken many steps in favor of tribals for their welfare
 kamalnath ne yah baat aise samay main kahi he, jab purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne mangalvaar ko yahaan adivaasiyon ke ek virodh pradarshan kaa netritv kiya
 In a statement issued by the government, Kamal Nath has said, "it has always been our policy that the tribal class should not only have all-round development, but also preserve the rights they have got from the tradition
 vanadhikaar kanoon 2006 samprag sarkaar ne lagu kiya tha
 Under this law, six lakh 25 thousand applications were received in Madhya Pradesh during the previous government of Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 inamen se teen lakh 55 hajaar aavedan nirast kar die gaye the
 Our government has revisited all these applications and started the work of giving forest rights letters to the eligible occupiers
 'mukhyamantri ne adivaasiyon or vanavaasiyon ke liye kiye ja rahe kaaryonka zikr karte hue kaha, 'rajya sarkaar ne tendupatta sangrahan kii dar 2000 rupee prati maanak bora se badhaakar 2500 rupee kar di he
 This decision of the government has given a benefit of Rs 500 per bag to the tribals engaged in the work of collecting tendu leaves
 yah raashi purv main bainkon ke madhyam se tendupatta shramikon ko di jaati thi, jisase unhen kathinaayee hoti thi
 Our government decided that cash collection of tendu leaf collection will be made to the collector

 (input-agency) koun kahata he ki itihaas khud ho nahin doharaata
 The same thing happened about a year ago and today the clouds of 'cold War' were seen receding
 bollywood ke do bade khan, shahrukh or salmaan
 Happy month of Ramadan
 congress ke aalaa netaa or nigahen milte-milte baat dil tak pahunch gai
 Yes, on Sunday, Shah Rukh and Salman hugged each other once again
 pichhali dfa bhi aisa hi hua tha
 This was the chance as well as the master
 tab 5 saal baad donon khan ne ek-duusare ko gale lagaaya tha
 Although this opportunity came again only after a year, but it is special because in the meantime, none of Shahrukh or Salman hardly managed each other for the whole year
 ravivaar ko congress netaa baba siddiki kii iftaar party main duriyon kii barf phir pighali or shahrukh, salmaan ek duusare ke gale mili
 On the question of hugging Shahrukh again, Salman said, 'only Baba Siddiqui can do this
 'tab bhi gale mili, lekin dil
 
 
 Last year too, both Khans hugged at Baba Siddiqui's Iftar party
 isse pehle donon main jhagada hua tha or baatcheet band ho gai thi
 Salman even went so far as to say that now only God can unite him and Shahrukh
 hua bhi kuch aisa hi ramajaan ke mubarak maheene main allaah ne nek din kii ibaarat likh daali or donon ek-duusare ke gale mili
 However, neither Shah Rukh nor Salman grew up after this
 yahaan tak ki aayojanon ke dauraan bhi bas 'hai-hello' kar kaam chalaate rahe
 But after a year, once again, the way the two have embraced each other, a wave of happiness has definitely arisen in the fans
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ghoshnaa kii he ki ab se 26 november ko har saal samvidhan diwas manaaya jayega
 Explain that the Indian Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1949 but came into force from 26 January 1950
 samvidhan ke masaude ko taiyaar karne kaa kaam iske aakaar lene se teen saal pehle or aazaadee se bhi ek saal pehle 1946 main shuru ho gaya tha

 prastut he us kitaab main shaamil samvidhan sabha se jude kuch rochak ansh - On 9 January 1946, the first meeting of the Constituent Assembly was held in which prominent Congress leaders Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel were sitting in the front seats
 lekin kahin is baithak ko sirf congress party kaa sho na maan liya jaae isliye vipaksh ke netaaon ko bhi aage kii seat par baithaaya gaya
 a national newspaper while printing the report of the conference wrote that '9 women members had filled the color in this gathering filled with Gandhi cap and Nehru jacket
 ' Though 82 percent members of the Constituent Assembly were also members of Congress but ideologically they all held different opinions like some of them were atheists and seculars, some were technically Congressmen but spiritually RSS and Hindu Mahasabha

 Denying Churchill's statement, the public was also asked to present its views before the constitution was put in place
 hazaron kii sankhya main logon ne apni pratikriyaayein bheji jaise akhil bhartiya varnshram swaraj sangh ne kaha ki samvidhan kaa aadhaar hindu dharm hona chahie, saath hi go-hatya or boojadkhaane band karne kii sifarish bhi kii gai thi
 At the same time, minority groups talked about protecting their rights and Dalits demanded the end of upper caste atrocities
 is tarah samvidhan ko taiyaar karne ke liye zyada se zyada logon kii hissedari maangi gai thi
 While drafting the constitution, women's reservation was also discussed, but apart from the current era, the women leaders of the time sought social, economic and political equality, bypassing the seats and quotas
 lekin mahila aarakshan ke paksh main sabase dilachasp tareeke se ek purush sadsy aar ke choudhary ne apni baat rakhi - mujhe lagata he ki hamen auraton ko ek vishesh nirvachan kshetra de dena chahie
 Anyway, when women ask for something, it becomes easy to fulfill their demand, but when they do not ask for anything, it becomes very difficult to know what they want
 agar ham unhen ek vishesh nirvachan kshetra de denge to vah usee ke liye aapas main bhidati rahengi or saamaanya chunavi kshetron se dur rahengi
 If not done, then we will have to give them the seats they do not deserve
 samvidhan sabha main sabase vivaadit vishay rahaa bhashaa jise lekar aksar sadsy zyada hi bhavuk ho jate the
 One such member, RV Dhulekar, spoke in Hindi, on which the Speaker interrupted him, saying that many people present in the meeting do not know Hindi and therefore they do not understand him
 is par dhulekar ne tilamilaate hue kaha ki 'jinhen hindustani nahin aati, unhen is desh main rahane kaa haq nahin he
 'when Dhulekar did not agree even after convincing enough, Nehru went ahead and asked him to return to his seat and pointed out the dignity of the House and said that' this is not your general meeting of Jhansi where you are saying 'brothers and sisters' Start giving a loud speech
 'yah bhi padhein - sonia ne kyon kaha 'isse bada mazaaq kya hoga' For this, how many meetings of the Constituent Assembly were held in which the members and the public gave their opinion on all the aspects related to the country and the countrymen
 in baithak se judi kuch dilachasp baton kaa zikr itihasvid ramchandra guha ne apni kitaab ‘india after gandhi’ main kiya he
 Here are some interesting excerpts related to the Constituent Assembly included in that book - 9 janvari 1946 ko samvidhan sabha kii pehali baithak hui thi jisamen congress ke pramukh netaa jawaharlal nehru or sardaar vallabh bhai patel aage kii siton par baithe the
 But somewhere this meeting should not be treated as a show of the Congress party only, so the leaders of the opposition were also placed in the front seat
 ek rashtriya akhbaar ne us sammelan kii report chhapate hue likhaa tha ki 'gandhi topi or nehru jacket se bhari is sabha main 9 mahila sadasyon ne rang bhar diya tha
 ' yun to samvidhan sabha ke 82 pratishat sadsy congress ke sadsy bhi the lekin vaicharik rup se yah sabhi alag alag raay rakhte the jaise inamen se kuch naastik or dharmanirpeksh the to kuch aise the jo takneekee rup se congressi the lekin aadhyatmik taur par aresas or hindu mahasabha ke sadsy the
 Some were socialists in their thinking, and some were in favor of the zamindars
 mote taur par is sabha main lokmat ke har pahalu ko jagah dene kii koshish kii gai thi
 Popular British leader Winston Churchill had commented on the making of the Indian Constitution, stating that 'a majority community of India will dominate the Constituent Assembly
 ' churchill ke is vaktavy ko nakaarte hue samvidhan ko mul rup dene se pehle janata se bhi apane vichaar prastut karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Thousands of people sent their responses such as the Swaraj Sangh, the All India Varnashram, said that the Constitution should be the basis of Hinduism, along with a recommendation to stop cow slaughter and slaughterhouses
 vahiin alpsankhyak samoohon ne apane adhikaron kii suraksha kii baat kahi or daliton ne oonchi jati ke atyaacharon ke khatme kii maang kii thi
 In this way, more and more people's participation was sought for drafting the constitution
 samvidhan ko taiyaar karne ke dauraan mahila aarakshan par bhi baat hui lekin maujuuda daur se itar us vakt kii mahila netaaon ne siton or cote ko darkinar karte hue saamaajik, aarthik or raajnneetik samanta kii maang kii
 But in the most interesting way in favor of women reservation, a male member RK Chaudhary made his point - i think we should give women a special constituency
 vaise bhi jab auraten kuch maangati hai to unki maang puri karnaa aasaan ho jaataa he lekin jab wo kuch nahin maangati to yah jaananaa bada mushkil ho jaataa he ki aakhir vah chaahati kya hai
 If we give her a special constituency, then she will keep fighting for it and stay away from general constituencies
 aisa nahin kiya to hamen unhen vah siten deni padengi jiske vah laayak nahin hai
 Language was the most disputed topic in the Constituent Assembly, about which members often became more emotional
 aise hi ek sadsy aarvi dhulekar ne hindi main apni baat kahi jis par adhyaksh ne unhen tokate hue kaha ki sabha main maujuud kai logon ko hindi nahin aati he or isliye vah unki baat samaj nahin paa rahe hai
 To this, Dhulekar stunned and said that those who do not know Hindustani do not have the right to live in this country
 ' jab kaaphi samajhane ke baad bhi dhulekar nahin maane to nehru ne aage badhkar unhen apni seat par lautne ko kaha or sadan kii garima kii taraf dhyaan dilaate hue kaha ki 'ye koi aapke jhaansi kii aamasabha nahin he jahaan aap 'bhaaiyo or bahano' kahkar oonchi awaz main bhaashan dena shuru kar den
 ' iske liye samvidhan sabha kii na jane kitni baithak hai jisamen desh or deshavaasiyon se jude tamaam pahaluon par sadasyon or janata ne apni raay rakhi

 Hema Malini's book 'beyond the Dream Girl' has been released recently
 kitaab main unhone bataaya he ki unke or sani deol ke bich dooriyaan kaise miti thi
 When Hema married Dharmendra, he was already married and had four children
 dharmendra kii pehali patni prakaash cor, hema ko bilkul bhi pasand nahin karti thim
 It is said that Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol also increased the distance from Hema Malini because of them
 haal hi main apni book launch ke maukey par hema ne bataaya tha ki jab unka accident hua tha, tab sani sabase pehle unase milane aae the
 If Hema Malini had a good relationship, where were Sunny Deol on these occasions? Hema Malini made her directorial debut in 1992 with the film 'dil Aashna Hai'
 film ke liye unhone apni acchhee dost dimple kapaadiya or mithun chakravarti ko sin kiya tha
 During this film, the distance between Hema and Sunny was erased
 kitaab main unhone likhaa he- main film main mithun ke saath paragliding seen shoot karnaa chaahati thi
 The film also had an airplane scene, which was necessary for a song sequence
 shooting ke kuch din pehle payalat kaa accident ho gaya tha or isse dimple bahut dari hui thim
 He told this to Sunny Deol
 iske baad sani aakar mujhase mili
 i told Sunny that there is nothing to worry, she will be safe
 iske baad ham donon main baatcheet shuru ho gai thi
 Sunny is just 8 years younger than Hema, what else is there in 3 Deol hit So 2 Flopkitab? 1) How did she get into politics: Hema Malini's autobiography mentions both daughters Esha Deol and Ahana Deol
 donon betiyon ke bachapan, unke kariyar, shaadi se jude tamaam pahalu kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 The autobiography describes how he entered politics
 aatmakatha ke lekhak raamakamal ne bataaya, "18 saal pehle 1999 main gurdaspur loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ummidavaar vinod khanna ke prachaar ke baad hema kaise raajnneeti main ai iskaa vistaar se zikr kiya gaya he
 There is a story of his joining the party and becoming a Rajya sabha-lok Sabha MP
 aatmakatha main 2015 main hue hema malini ke car accident kaa bhi pramukhataa se zikr kiya gaya he
 2) How Acting Begins: For the first time, the autobiography will reveal the spiritual life of Hema Malini
 kitaab main is baat kaa zikr he ki hema malini or jayalalita ek saath tamil film se debyue karnaa chaahati thim, lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa
 Despite signing the film, that project could not progress further
 baad main 16 saal kii umr main rajkpur ke oposit 'sapanom kaa saudagar' ke jariye wo hindi filmon main heroin ke taur par najar ain
 The story of a South Indian girl becoming a successful actress in Hindi films is recorded in the book
 hema malini se nahin hoti sani kii baat, bahanon ke saath aise hai rishte3)hema ke faislon par maa kaa kitna asar rahaa :filmon ke liye producers, diarectors hema se nahin balki unki maa jaya lakshmi chakravarti se baat karte the
 If her mother found any scene in the film offensive, she would ask her to remove it
 hema malini ek stylish heroin ke taur par jaani jaati thim
 He started the trend of polka dots, oversized sunglasses, platform heels, but he never wore Vulgar clothes in films
 wo khud in sab chizon main comfortable nahin hoti thim
 4) Why broken engagement with Jitendra: Hema Malini did not want to make her career in films, but what was the reason she chose the film as her profession, why did she not go to the industry despite being South Indian? i will also know you by reading this book
 aapako bataa den ki kitaab padhakar aapako pataa chalegaa ki jitendra sang unka afaire nahin tha, lekin donon kii shaadi jarur tay hui thi, lekin donon kaa rishta kinhin vajahon se tut gaya tha
 Please tell that Hema is currently bjp's Lok Sabha MP from Mathura

 Since this incident, tension has remained around the railway station in Malad West
 jhagade kii ashanka ko dekhte hue police kaa baari bandobast kiya gaya he
 a large number of MNS activists, including party leaders Nitin Sardesai, Shalini Thackeray, Sandeep Deshpande, reached Malad after receiving news of the attack on the MNS worker
 emenes netaaon kaa aarope he ki pheriwaalon ne sanjay nirupam ke uksaave par hamalaa kiya isliye nirupam ke khilaaf bhi maamla darj kiya jaae
 Mumbai Congress President Sanjay Nirupam has opposed the mns's Pheriwala Hatao campaign
 unhone jagah-jagah sabhaayen kar eent kaa jawaab pathar se dene kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 It is reported that in Malad too, he had organized a meeting of hawkers
 jiske jawaab main dopaher ko emenes kaaryakarta pheriwaalon ko hataane pahunche the

 Mumbai Congress President Sanjay Nirupam has opposed the mns's Pheriwala Hatao campaign
 unhone jagah-jagah sabhaayen kar eent kaa jawaab pathar se dene kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 It is reported that in Malad too, he had organized a meeting of hawkers
 jiske jawaab main dopaher ko emenes kaaryakarta pheriwaalon ko hataane pahunche the
 They began to turn around with ugly abuses, driving them away only when they were attacked from behind
 gauratlab he ki elifinston bhagdad haadase ke baad se pheriwale emenes ke nishane par hai
 The MNS alleges that people face problems due to hawkers on the footover bridge and exit routes of the station and there is a possibility of an accident
 emenes netaa raaj thakare ne sabha lekar rail prashasan ko chetavanee di thi ki 15 din ke andar agar prashasan ne sabhi pheriwaalon ko hataaya nahin to emenes kaaryakarta khud apane style main hataayenge
 Since the completion of 15 days, MNS workers have beaten up hawkers at different railway stations in Mumbai and damaged their belongings
 tippaniyan This campaign of MNS is also being welcomed in a big way as it was difficult to walk around the stations due to illegal hawkers
 shikaayat ke baad bhi police, railway or biemasi unhen hataane kii bajaay haftaa lekar shah dete rahe hai
 But there is also the issue related to the livelihood of the hawkers, so some people are against the MNS too, especially with their beatings and hooliganism

 Significantly, after the Elphinstone stampede incident, Pheriwale has been on the target of MNS
 emenes kaa aarope he ki stesan ke footover brij or baahar nikalne ke raaston par pheriwaalon kii vajah se logon ko pareshaani hoti he or haadase kii ashanka bani rahati he
 MNS leader Raj Thackeray had warned the railway administration by taking the meeting that if the administration does not remove all the hawkers within 15 days, then MNS workers will remove themselves in their style
 15 din puure hone ke baad se mumbai ke alag-alag railway steshnon par emenes kaaryakartaaon ne pheriwaalon kii pitayee kii he unke saamaanon kaa nuksaan kiya he

 lekin pheriwaalon kii roji roti se judaa mudda bhi he isliye kuch log emenes ke khilaaf bhi hai, khaskar unki marpet or gundgardee se
 The issue is illegal hawkers versus MNS, but it is becoming MNS against the traditional, which may later take the form of a conflict between two communities

 But the silent role of the state government is also in question in this whole matter

 " america fast food brands burgers king, keeffsi or mcdonald jaise bade naamon ke bich ek naam teji se apni jagah bana chukaa he or iske fast food main shaamil he mumbai kaa desi vada pav
 If someone wants to eat the Indian burger — Jamboking tells his Vada Pav — he eats Jamboking Vada Pav with great fervor
 vaaki bade aakaar kaa yah vada pav behad jaayakedaar he kyonki jamboking mumbai ke is aam street food ko shejawan, crispi veg, nachose or corn paalak jaise flavor main bechata he
 The person who makes Vada Pav stand out against the burger is Dheeraj Gupta
 maharashtra ke vada pav bazaar ke 20 fisadi hisse par kabja jamaane—80 fisadi hissaa ab bhi paaramparik vendors ke paas—or mumbai tathaa pune main kamyaabi ke baad jamboking baahar bhi pair pasaarne ko taiyaar he
 Dheeraj Gupta, who started this brand, realized the golden future of Vada Pav
 unhone dekha ki puri mumbai main vada pav ke saikadon vikreta hai, par sabhi asangathit hai
 He decided to get into this business
 gupta ne kisi tarah 2 lakh rupayon kaa bandobast karke agast, 2001 main malad railway stesan ke najadik apana pehla store kholaa tha
 The waste of goods is more in the work of vada pav
 use rokkar gupta ne laagat kam kar lee
 With this, they had the option to keep the prices low and also give a larger size vada pav
 gupta ne doosraa vikalp apanaaya or dusron ke mukaable 20 fisadi bada vada pav dene lage
 From the size, he also got the name of his brand: Jamboking
 yah chal niklaa
 Says Gupta, 44, "my motive was not to beat the burger
 airport yaa bas stop par log jaldbaaji main rahete hai
 They have money
 ve saaf-suthra khaanaa chaahate hai
 But they do not have a choice
 jamboking ne logon ko vikalp muhaiyaa karaayaa or ek badi company ban gai
 5,000 on the first day of Malad's own small store
 kaa kaarobaar karne vaale gupta ne apane kaam main saaf-safai kaa khaas khyaal rakhaa
 Gupta started the second outlet of his brand in Kandivali in 2003
 2005 tak mumbai main jamboking ke paanch outlet ho chuke the
 But he was having technical difficulties in spreading his footing outside Mumbai
 iskaa hal mila 2007 main, jab ek aise shaks se unki mulaakaat hui jo bahurashtriya food brands ke liye ready tu frai supplai karata tha
 This solved Gupta's big problem
 aaj jamboking vada pav franchise ke madhyam se hi kai shaharon main fail chukaa he
 It currently has 112 franchised outlets, out of which 90 are in Mumbai and 22 are in Pune
 bakaul gupta, "jamboking vada pav ke saath hamaara safar badhibia rahaa he
 The company has been growing for 17 years
 buniyadi vichaar tha indian food ko sangathit karne kaa, taaki logon ko acchhee cheez thik-thaak keemat main mil sake
 We are getting success in this
 ''gupta kaa sara dhyaan philhal mumbai or pune par hi he
 But in the coming years, Jamboking is also planning to open outlets in 8 other cities including Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata
 lekin franchiji model ko kaamyaab kai se bana paae? gupta bataate hai, "aapako isamen involve hona hoga
 One who invests will not want to do a bad job
 myth he ki franchise main phayda nahin he
 But there is no problem if the concept is clear
 '' ve bataate hai ki unhone apane pav kaa sies bada rakhane ke liye apni bekri nahin kholi thi balki pav hameshaa baahar se liya he
 But why is street food like vada pav? In response, he says, "we looked at the organized form of mcdonald's and wondered why our Vada Pav could not be an organization when mcdonald's could be organized in America
" '' ve yah bhi kehete hai ki bharat main bahut saare sthaneey vyanjan hai
 If we make a supply chain for that, then they can also be expanded
 jamboking aaj yuvaaon or yuva peshewaron ke bich kaaphi lokapriy he
 They are crazy about its flavors
 iske swaad ko lekar gupta khud bhi satark rahete hai
 They mostly live in the field and eat vada pav from any of their stores
 isse apane brand ke vada pav ke swaad par unki nigahabaani rahati he
 They also make improvements based on feedback received from customers
 ve bataate hai ki unhone rojaanaa hajaaron vada pav kii supplai ke liye takanic kaa istemaal kiya he
 The challenge for him was how to bring automation so that the hygiene would also be balanced
 par jamboking vada pav kii kamyaabi jari kaise rakhi ja rahi he? gupta kehete hai, "abhi mere paas vada pav kii saat variety hai
 Work on a new product is in progress
 jis product ko log kam pasand karte hai, use hataakar nayaa product laate hai
 Even after five years, if we talk, only seven of our products will remain
 lekin inamen alag variety hogi
 Gupta controls his market through quality
 gupta ke product kii khaasiyat he saaf-suthra, sehatmand branded vada pav, vah bhi kam keemat main
 Today, Jamboking Vada Pav is the largest selling Vada Pav brand in the country
 gupta muskuraate hue kehete hai, "shuru main hamane brand kaa naam rakhane ke liye 50 naamon kii list banaai thi
 Eventually the name Jumboking was liked
 yah naam yaad rakhana aasaan he
 Everyone remembers everything from a small child
 is brand kii apni takat he
 “to maintain the quality of his feet, Gupta takes special care of diversity, cleanliness and innovation
 jamboking in teenon main kuch na kuch nayaa karte rahete hai
 After all, by diversifying mango street food like Vada Pav, the attention of the youth can be drawn
 bahurashtriya food brands ke mukaable jamboking jabaan ke saath jeb kaa bhi khyaal rakhata he
 Gupta also goes to some business schools and national and international seminars to inspire others in this business with his success story
 jamboking vada pav jaisi saamaanya cheez ko shikhar tak pahunchane kii kamyaabi kaa kissa he, jaahir he, use har jagah sunaane kaa vakt bhi aa gaya he
 Started a small outlet near the railway station in Malad in 2001 before becoming a travelogue
 pehle din kii bikri 5,000 ru

 He may have learned this important lesson from Sachin and Dravid, but his discomfort still dominates
 kisi ko use sahi maargdarshan dena hoga

 Here are some statements, which have been raining on Kejriwal since morning

 In the Anna Hazare movement in 2012, Kejriwal had said that now a dharna will not work, a government has to be formed
 jabaki ab jab wo sarkaar bana chuke hai to bol rahe hai ki dharna karnaa jaruri he
 Neither the account nor the book, what Kejriwal would say, right Congress Secretary Digvijay Singh said, Kejriwal never thinks about law and order

 All i want to know is where is the money collected at the time of India Against Corruption

 According to Minister Manish Tiwari, who is running away from responsibility, 'we do not want the people of Delhi to face another election

 Kejriwal should tell the public whether he believes in India to be a republic or not

 Kejriwal made huge promises to the public, but when he felt that the promises would not be fulfilled, he was running away from responsibility
 unhone kaha ki jis janata ne unhen sir maathe bithaaya he, vahi unhen majaa chakhaane se nahin chukegi
 AAP MLA Vinod Kumar Binny has been trying to hide the failure, says, “the Delhi government is waiting for the code of conduct to be implemented and to hide its failures, they have now started picketing

 monsoon sijan kii shuruyaat main yani june ke duusare hafte se hi desh main barish ne jor pakadalia or ye sthiti agast main bhi bani hui he
 Because of this, farmers sowed extensively sowing of kharif crops

 Due to good rains this time, the area under sowing of paddy in the country was 276 from last year
 10 lakh hectare ke mukaable 281
 Has been 95 lakh hectares
 yani dhan utpaadak rajyon main rakabe main badhotaree he
 Farmers will be benefited with better sowing and due to the period of heavy rain, there is a possibility of lowering the cost of farmers along with increase in its production

 Sowing of pulses till August 5 last year 89
 72 lakh hectare rakabe main hui thi
 But this time sowing of pulses crops in kharif season 121

 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) kii 3 divasiy vyaakhyaan shrinkhalaa ke antim din sangh pramukhmohan bhagwatne kaha ki desh main shiksha ke kshetra main nijee sansthaaon kaa bada yogadan he
 Bhagwat said that private organizations have done many important experiments and the magical effect of these experiments is seen in the education of the country
 lihaaja, desh main shiksha ke str ko sudhaarney ke liye hamen sarkaar kii pahal yaa shiksha niti kaa intjaar kiye bagaiyr sarthak pahal karte rahane kii jarurat he
 Mohan Bhagwat claimed on the basis of Dharmapala's text that the British conducted a survey after the suzerainty over India and found it shocking figures
 bhagwat ke mutabiongreji hukumatko survey main pataa chalaa ki bharat kii tatkaaleen shiksha paddati parampara main nihit thi
 At the same time, this education system was more effective and would make more people literate
 bhagwat ne yah bhi kaha ki angrejon ko sarv main yah bhi pataa chalaa ki bhartiya shiksha jivan ko adhik yogya banane main kargar thi or isliye angrejon ne parampara par aadhaarit bhartiya shiksha pranali kii jagah apni ayogy pranali ko desh par thopane kaa kaam kiya
 Mohan Bhagwat said that the new education policy needs to be prepared by taking what is to be taken from our tradition by incorporating what is worth taking into the modern education system
 bhagwat ne kaha ki nai shiksha niti jald aane vaali he or ummid jaahir kii ki is niti main unki kahi sabhi baton kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya hoga
 Speaking on the education of other religions, Bhagwat said that a large number of sects from outside India have arrived and hence the values of such sects should be included in education
 haalanki, bhagwat ne skulon main dharm kii shiksha dene se parhez karne kii baat kahi
 Bhagwat said that it is sufficient to give knowledge of the basic understanding of religions in education
 desh main shiksha ke ghatate str par mohan bhagwat ne kaha ki shiksha kaa str nahin ghatata balki shiksha grahan karne or shiksha dene waalon ke str main utaar-chadhaav hota he
 Bhagwat said that both students and teachers need to understand clearly why they are doing the work of teaching and giving
 unhen shiksha ko mahaj aay ke madhyam ke taur par grahan karne se parhez karne kii jarurat he
 Although Mohan Bhagwat admitted that degrees are being given on a large scale in the country, but there is slowness in research work
