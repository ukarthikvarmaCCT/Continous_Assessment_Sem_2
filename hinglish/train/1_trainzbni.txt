 Bharatiya Janata Party's young MP and National Secretary Varun Gandhi does not consider himself to be a generational cousin of 10 years and Rahul Gandhi, the national general secretary of the Congress, but both seem to be preparing the same 'recipe' of politics
 rahul jahaan ek ore garibon ko desh kii asli shakti bataa rahe hai, vahiin varun aam janata se samvaad or sampark badha kar ‘garib kendrit’ raajnneeti kii raah par chalane par jor de rahe hai
 Varun Gandhi said here today that 'I have a thinking, that thinking is that politics should not be election-centric but poor-centered
 ’ varun lakhanu se sate hardoi jile ke kuch baadh peedit logon se milane ke liye aaj yahaan amausi hawaii adde par pahunchane ke baad samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet kar rahe the
 He said that 'politics should be poor centered
 
 However, today no one wants to be called poor because the feeling of self-respect and respect has increased among the people, which is a good thing
 ’ varun ne kaha ki party ke sabhi raajnneetik kaaryakartaaon or netaaon ko chaiye ki ve jamini raajnneeti karen or samaaj ke har tabake kaa vishwaas jeeten
 
 sabhi ko chahie ki ve diwaali ke din kisi baadh peedit gaanv main jaakar vahaan diya jalaayen
 Asked whether you are doing the same thing that Rahul Gandhi is doing, Varun said, "all the people who are roaming around, everyone is learning
" rahul ji mujhase umr main 10 saal bade hai
 i do not consider him of my generation
 ’saarvajanik or raajnneetik jivan main saamaanya logon ko adhik vishwasaneey bataate hue varun ne kaha, ‘saamaanya aadmi kaa rishta dal se nahin dil se he
 Political people can be dull in mind, because they have ambition
 ’uttar pradesh main kam se kam ek karod logon ke nadiyon ke baadh seemaa kshetra main rahane ke baavjood baadh se bachaav ke liye koi khaas prabhavi yojana kaa abhaav hone kaa daawa karte hue varun ne kaha ki unki yojana he ki bhavishya main vah uttar pradesh ke vibhinn kshetron main jaakar do-teen din rukenge taaki aam janata se milane or unki samasyaayein samajhane kaa puraa avasar mili
 He also said, 'how many people usually meet their leaders and mps
 jabaki aaj kaa aadmi zyada samvedansheel he or vah chahta he ki unke janpratinidhi unase sidhe sampark main rahen
 Accountability of public representatives has increased
 ’ varun ne kaha, ‘‘hamen nirantar jansampark or jansanvaad ke jariye logon ko yah ehsaas karana chahie ki ham sukh dukh main unke saath khadey he
 BJP national secretary Varun reiterated that party workers and leaders should visit a flood-affected family on Diwali and burn it there and not do it as a political campaign but with a sense of duty
 saansadon main apane vetan-bhatte badhwane main saansadon main badi ekta dikhaai dene ke sawaal par varun ne kaha ki raajnneeti main anek log aarthik drushti se saadhaaran pariwaron se aate hai or unke liye to yah jaruri ho saktaa he, ‘magar ham bahut se log khush kismat he, hamen koi aarthik sankat nahin he or ham sansad main vetan ke liye nahin jate hai

 After the rape incident in Uber's taxi on December 5, the society and the system have awakened just as the wake of the December 16, 2012 incident
 tab kade kanoon kii kami kaa pataa laga tha, jise record samay main durust kar diya gaya, lekin ab jeepies, sisitivi veriphication or license dene main laaparvaahee jaisi kamiyon kii pahchaan ho rahi he
 The mobile app that we were promoting like the panacea of new-age governance has beaten the drum in this case
 ubar taxi driver kaa record bataa rahaa he ki us par kai prakaar ke aapraadhik maamle chal rahe hai
 a rape case is also going on in Mainpuri, in which he is out on bail
 kai baar giraftaar hone ke baad bhi adaalat ne use doshi nahin tehraaya he
 In such a situation, if there was an MP, from the political party to the Prime Minister, he would have been advocating his innocence
 lambit mukademon ke rahete aap saansad ho sakate hai, magar driver nahin ho sakate
 Obviously we have to put the questions right
 sab kuch dilli−dilli karne se nahin hoga, mainpuri or mathura main bhi sansthaaon ko badalanaa hoga
 Had the company even conducted an investigation into accused Shiv Kumar Yadav, would the guarantee not have been fraudulent in this
 dilli police ke veriphication par bhi kai log sawaal uthaa dete hai
 Delhi Police takes the verification form and sends it to the police of another state from the registry
 kai baar galtiyaan pakadi bhi jaati hai, lekin agar us rajya ke zile ke kisi thane kii police ne sahi jaankaree nahin di to phir dilli police ke paas koi chaara nahin hota
 It is not necessary that the record of the accused is found only in the police station where he is residing
 dilli main privet companiyaan bhi apane karmchaariyon kaa veriphication karaati hai
 She sends you a letter and sends it to the DCP office, where a slip of 250 rupees is cut

 There is no doubt that the radio taxi has given a better option to the working women working alone in the metropolis overnight
 jeepies or esemes system se las corporate hone ke kaaran bhi suraksha kaa bhav panpa hoga
 Before the Uber incident, if you ask the women walking in these taxis, then their experience will be right from the right to the best
 ab kaiyon kaa aatmavishvaas hill gaya he
 Mumbai Police has said that it will count black-yellow radio taxi, mobile app based taxi
 sabhi driveron kaa police veriphication hoga
 The Bengaluru Police has also decided for verification

 OK, girls are now reporting on this incident, but is this argument complete? balaatkaar kii sankhya kam nahin hui yah sawaal kyon nahin he or yah kiski naakaami he
 The question is not only about the drivers but also to provide a reliable transport system to the women

 kargil ke vakt pakistan ne captain kaaliya kaa kshat-vikshat shav bharat ko saunpa tha
 Not many days have passed
 sarhad paar ke is mehmaan ne hamaare angan main ghuskar kargil ke shahid kaa apmaan kiya tha
 The Pakistani Interior Minister, who visited India, may have expressed regret later after making objectionable statements on Captain Sourav Kalia, but how the Pakistan government thinks about the Indian Army, it was evident
 darasal elosi par firing ke baad bhartiya sainikon ke saath jo vibhats bartaav kiya gaya he, usase kargil ke shahid saurav kaaliya kii yaad taaja ho ai he
 Obviously, Rahman Malik cannot stamp out the cowardly and barbaric actions of his own army, but the incident on Aloisi on Tuesday has unmasked the neighbor's anti-pak acts
 1999 ke kargil yuddh main pakistani sena ne captain saurav kaaliya ko bandi banaakar pratadit kiya or unke kshat-vikshat shav ko bharat ko saunp diya tha
 Sourav Kalia's father is still fighting to punish the culprits of this shameless and inhuman act
 pakistan ne captain kaaliya ke saath jo bartaav kiya, wo yudhbandiyon ko lekar hue geneva samjhaute kaa bhi ulanghan he
 But the neighbor is not equal in his words and actions
 chamatkaar ho jaae agar pakistan apane kahe par kaayam hone lage
 Neither in the case of martyr Sourav Kalia nor in the incident of these two soldiers who were martyred on LOC, Pakistan will show its finger

 Ashley Tellis of the Carnegie Movement for International Peace said, "this historic victory is not only a victory for Modi, but a victory for the Indian people, which has given a clear message against economic mismanagement and policy inertia
" ' unhone kaha, 'ummid he ki modi kaa nirvachan bhartiya arthvyavastha kii samasyaon ko thik karne kii disha main nai raah kholegaa or aisa hua to yah bharat-america sambandhon ke liye acchhee khabar he
 Telis also said that Modi's election could be good news for American companies, but the US still needs to do a lot more to take advantage of Modi's election to build better bilateral relations
 unhone kaha, 'congress ne jaisaa kai dashak pehle kiya tha, purna bahumat vaali akeli party ke saath modi ko bhartiya raajnneetik ko pun: paribhaashit karne kaa mauka mila he or agar modi apane jeet ke fomurle par kaayam rahete hai to vah aane vaale lambey samay tak bharat ke pradhanmantri bane rah sakate hai

 However, Rossov said that the relationship between the governments of the two countries will progress slowly in the context of not being granted visas to Modi

 Salman Khan seems to be more happy about his upcoming film, which he answered this question in such a cool way
 elahabaad main lage kumbh meley main snaan karke ham or aap jaise log pavitra ho gaye, lekin hamaara choda gaya kachra ab elahabaad ke bashindon ke liye jaharila or adhikariyon ke liye maldaar bana hua he
 The government patted itself heavily on the cleanliness of the Kumbh in Allahabad, but the garbage of Kumbh has now become a mountain in Allahabad and threatens the cleanliness of the Yamuna river
 kumbh meley main behatar saaf safai or intjaam kaa shrey jor shor se pradhanmantri le rahe hai
 The Government kept the Kumbh Mela bright for 55 days by putting twenty thousand sanitation workers and 1
25 million toilets for cleanliness, but the government never knew about where about twenty thousand tons of garbage of 10 crore people who came to Kumbh Mela went Granted
 sangam kaa kooda is vakt elahabaad se kareeb bees kimi dur basavaara gaanv ke ek damping ground main kooday ke pahaad ke taur par bad rahaa he
 There is sixty thousand tons of garbage at this place, just three km away from Yamuna river, of which twenty thousand tons are given by Kumbh Mela
 elahabaad ke karnalganj se parshad anand ghildial urf aanu plant bataate hai ki yahaan badi plastic panniyon main kumbh ke kooday dher jamaa he
 Allahabad is shown as a smart city but its garbage is being hidden
 anand kaa kahana he ki kooda prabandhan karne vaali company or adhikariyon kii mileebhagat se karodon rupye kaa ghotaalaa kiya ja rahaa he
 Many times this issue has been raised in the corporation but is not crawling on anyone's ear
 anand bataate hai ki kumbh meley or elahabaad shahar se nikalne vaale is kooday se yahaan plastic kaa dana or khaad bananaa tha, lekin iske liye ai mashinari bhi jang or makadi kaa jaala lagakar kooday main tabdeel ho rahi hai
 Actually, the responsibility of managing the waste of Kumbh Mela and Allahabad is that of a private company, but the machines are defective here
 plant kii bijli cat chuki he
 Several years ago, some sacks of manure made from this litter are seen, the rest of the plant is also being swallowed by the garbage slowly
 elahabaad or kumbh meley ke kooday se yamuna nadi ke kinare based basavaar jaise kai gaanv prabhavit hai
 People complain that due to dumping of sixty thousand tonnes of garbage in the open, both air and water have become poisonous for the villagers
 basavaar gaanv ke raamu nishad bataate hai ki barish hoti he to saans lenaa muhaal he
 Children are falling ill in every household
 lekin kumbh meley or elahabaad jaise shaharon kaa kachra bees kimi dur phenkakar sarkari vibhaag chaiyn kii saans le rahaa he
 The shame is that government officials are also littering crores of rupees of tax payers in the name of garbage management
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke do sarkari bangalon ke maamle main supreme court ne kaha ki mukhyamantri ke paas do bangale rahen to isamen harj kya he? ek bangala rahane ke liye to doosraa sarkari kaamkaaj ke liye
 The court said - The Chief Minister has a lot of work, a lot of people come to meet him, if a second bungalow has been taken for office work, then what is wrong? In this way, the judges also have two parts, a secretariat and a residence
 haalanki supreme court ne kaha ki upi main chunaav hone hai isliye maamle kii sunwaayee chunaav ke baad april main karenge
 In fact, the Public Interest Litigation was filed by the Lok Sentinel Organization by the Supreme Court
 yachika main akhilesh ko paanch kalidaas maarg ke bangale ke alaava chaar vikramaditya maarg par sarkari bangala dene ko chunauti di gai thi
 Earlier in November, the Lucknow High Court gave a major relief to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and dismissed the petition challenging the allotment of a second bungalow to him
 bench ne kaha tha ki mukhyamantri dwaara pehle se aavantit ek bangale ko karyaalay ke taur par bhi istemaal kiya ja rahaa he, jahaan jaahir taur par bahut se log milane aate honge
 In such a situation the privacy of the family must have been violated
 lihaaja duusare bangale kaa aavanton aisa vishay nahin jisamen court hastkshep kare
 The comments yachika main kaha gaya he ki mukhyamantri ko 5 kalidaas maarg ke alaava 4 vikramaditya maarg ke bangale kaa aavanton upi ministars (vetan, bhatte or prakeern upbandh) adhinium- 1981 se pare jaakar kiya janaa bataaya gaya
 SN Shukla had argued to the court that the amendment in the said Act this year has been done so that the bungalow remains with him even after the Chief Minister is relieved
 vahiin sarkaar kaa tark tha ki 1985 se hi pradesh main mukhyamantri ko do bangale aavantit kiye jane kii pratha chali aa rahi he
 The petition sought repeal of the order to allot another bungalow besides 5 Kalidas Marg by making the Chief Minister as the respondent no
 darasal, lok prahari sanghathan ne supreme court ne janhit yachika kii thi
 In the petition, Akhilesh was challenged to give five bungalows on Kalidas Marg and a government bungalow on four Vikramaditya Marg
 isse pehle november main lakhanu hoicourt ne mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko badi raahat dete hue unhen doosraa bangala aavantit kiye jane ko chunauti dene vaali yachika khaarij kar di thi
 The bench had said that a bungalow already allotted by the Chief Minister is also being used as an office where many people would obviously come to meet
 aise main parivaar kii niztaa kaa hanan hota hoga
 Therefore, allocation of second bungalow is not a subject in which the court intervenes
 tippaniyan The petition said that the Chief Minister was asked to allot the bungalow of 4 Kalikas Marg and 4 Vikramaditya Marg, beyond the UP Ministers (salary, Allowances and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act - 1981
 esen shukla ne court ko tark diya tha ki ukt adhinium main isi saal sanshodhan karte hue yah aavanton isliye bhi kiya gaya he taaki mukhyamantri ke kaaryamukt hone ke baad bhi bangala unke paas bana rahe
 At the same time, the government argued that since 1985, the practice of allocating two bungalows to the Chief Minister is going on in the state

 bharat ke nae test captain viraat kohli ne somvaar ko sidney main kaha ki jab vah kal se yahaan shuru hone vaale chauthe or antim cricket test main team kii aguai karenge to mushkil halaat main dhairyavan rahakar apane purvavarti mahendra singh dhoni ke nakshekadam par chalane kii koshish karenge
 On the announcement of Dhoni's retirement, Kohli said, "we were changing clothes in the dressing form after the Melbourne Test and packing our stuff when Dhoni came and started saying that he wanted to say something
" iske baad usne apane faisle kii ghoshnaa kii or ham sab sakate main aa gaye
 All this happened in such a hurry that nothing was understood
 hamane aisi ummid nahin kii thi or yah hamaare liye stabdh karne vaala tha
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘hamen nahin pataa tha ki kya kahana he kyonki yah uske liye kaaphi bhaavnaatmak lamhaa tha
 For us too, who started as young under his captaincy, it was a strange moment
 ’’ Kohli praised Dhoni, saying, "there was a lot to learn from him, especially in difficult circumstances, his patience and ability to take decisions on important moments
" ye chijen beshkeemtee hai or koi bhi captain aisa apane andar hona pasand karegaa
 i hope that i too will be as patient as him
 ’’ Kohli, who played the caretaker captain in the first Test at the Adelaide Oval due to Dhoni's finger injury, had scored a century in both innings and took India closer to victory, but the team lost by 48 runs
 kohli ne haalanki kaha ki sheersh kram ke ballebaaj apni galatiyon se seekhney ko taiyaar hai
 Adelaide may have lost Testbaceous India, but this match was forever recorded in the pages of history
 bharat ke kaaryvahak captanviraat kohli jis tarah kii ballebaaji kii yah shaayad pehle kabhi nahin hui
 Kohli scored a century in both innings while debuting as a Test captain
 isse pehle australia ke greg chapel bhi yah karnama kar chuke hai
 But Kohli also overtook him
 chapel ne westeindies ke viruddh 1975 main ek match kii donon pariyon main 123 or 109 (232) ran banaae the
 Kohli surpassed him by scoring 115 and 141 (256) runs and set the record for the most runs as a debut captain
 captain ke taur par jo aakraamakata ek samay saurav ganguli main dikhaa karti thi, vahi aakraamakata ab kohli main dikhti he
 Before now, in the mental and verbal war, Indian players were often seen losing to the Kangaroos, but Kohli started a new era
 captain ke taur par jis agreshan ke saath kohli ne apane khilaadiyon kaa saport kiya vah vaaki dekhne laayak tha
 When David Warner and Steven Smith got entangled with the Indian players, Kohli immediately came in the middle and asked them to stay within their limits
 kohli ne sirf jubaan se hi nahin balki apane pradarshan se bhi sabit kar diya ki vah kangaaroon kii tulana main maansik rup se kahin bhi kamjor nahin hai
 However, many consider this aggressive nature of Kohli to be responsible for losing the Test match
 kai logon kaa maananaa hoga ki agar itane aakraamak na hote to test match drow ho saktaa tha
 Kohli's simple answer to those people was that after playing five days of cricket, you play not to win for a draw
 kohli kii is baat main dam bhi he kyonki tii-20 ke aa jane se test maichon kii chamak feeki padi he, aise main agar vaaki test cricket ko jinda rakhane main koi cheez madadgaar ho sakati he to wo he is tarah ke romaanchak match
 
 
 
 
 When Michael Clarke got a glimpse of Tendulkar in Kohli, after the Adelaide Test, Australia captain Michael Clarke said that the threat we felt from Sachin Tendulkar is happening to Kohli today
 jo ranneeti ham sachin ko out karne ke liye banaate the vahi aaj kohli kaa wicket lene ke liye banani pad rahi he
 He said that under the difficult conditions Kohli had almost won India while batting, he really showed his class today
 kohli ne kaha mujhe australian kaa andaaj he pasandkehte hai lohe ko loha hi katata he
 Australian players have often resorted to sledging to win matches
 siries jaise-jaise aage badhegi yahaan bhi garmi badhegi
 Here Virat Kohli has also said that he likes Australia's style of playing cricket
 ishaaron-ishaaron main kohli ne saaf kar diya he ki agar kangaaroon ne had paar karne kii koshish kii, to ye bhi peeche nahin rahenge

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke maddenjar chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue maharashtra ke wardha main piem narendra modi ne ensipi adhyaksh sharad pavaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 In Wardha, Maharashtra, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that there was a time when Sharad Pawar thought that he too could become Prime Minister
 unhone elaan bhi kiya tha ki wo ye chunaav ladenge
 But suddenly one day said that no, i am happy here only in Rajya Sabha, i will not contest elections
 sharad pavaar ji bhi jaanate hai ki hawa kaa rukh kis taraf he
 PM Modi said that Sharad Pawar Saheb has been one of the most senior and experienced leaders of the country
 wo koi bhi kaam bina soche-vichaare nahin karte
 PM Modi also accused Sharad Pawar of doing dynastic politics
 unhone kaha ki sharad pavaar dwaara vanshavaad kii raajnneeti ko badhaava die jane kii vajah se zyaadaatar ensipi netaaon ko 'ritred hart' ho jane kaa hi rasta zyada aasaan lag rahaa he
 PM Mod said that now people have made Pawar Saheb bold
 piem modi ne sharad pavaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki unke jhooth, unke jhuthe vaayadon kii pole khul chuki he or wo khud bhattije ke haathon hit-wicket ho chuke hai
 Despite being a farmer himself, Sharad Pawar forgot the farmers, forgot their concerns
 piem modi ne kaha ki unke kaarykaal main kitne hi kisaanon ko khudakushi ke liye majaboor hona padaa, lekin pavaar sahab ne koi parvaah nahin kii
 PM Modi said that the focus of Sharad Pawar was not on the condition of the farmers
 unhone maharashtra ke kisaanon ke liye sharad pavaar ke bhattije dwaara upyog kiye gaye apshabdon kii bhi yaad dilaai
 PM Modi said, don't forget, what answer did he get when a farmer from Maharashtra went to Ajit Pawar to ask questions about water in dams
 mat bhuuliye, jab mawal ke kisaan apane adhikaar ke liye lard rahe the, to pavaar parivaar ne un par goli chalaane kaa aadesh de diya tha
 PM Modi said that to eradicate this hunger for money, crores of billions of rupees are raised, such as irrigation, stamps, real estate, road projects, government tenders, where they are made
 maharashtra main congress auki NCP kaa gathbandhan kumbhakarna kii tarah he
 They sleep for 6-6 months when in power
 6 maheene main koi ek uthta he or janata kaa paisa khaakar phir sone chalaa jaataa he
 People of the Pawar family are furious over which seats to fight, where to leave
 is vajah se dusron kaa dhairya bhi samaapt ho rahaa he
 PM Modi said that one of his problems is that a big family war is going on in the NCP at this time
 party unke haath se nikalati ja rahi he or sthiti ye he ki pavaar sahab ke bhattije dhire-dhire party par kabja karte ja rahe hai
 For this reason, NCP is also facing problems in ticket distribution

 11 on Thursday morning
 30 baje pakistan kii taraf se poonch jile ke mendhar sector main sijafire todaa gaya
 Pakistan has been doing this continuously for the last few days, but Indian soldiers are giving it a befitting reply every time
 bataa den ki aaj hi pakistan ne apni ek belistic missile kaa pareekshan bhi kiya he
 Mortars were fired and fired at Mendhar from Pakistan side on Thursday morning
 gauratlab he ki mendhar se pehle pakistan kii taraf se poonch jile main hi pichley kuch dinon main golibari kii ja chuki he
 However, each time Pakistan has to face the mouth and then it becomes quiet
 3 hafte main dher hue das pakistan jawanbharat sarkaar ne jammu-kashmir se 5 agast ko anuchhed 370 kamjor karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 Since then Pakistan has been angry and venting its anger on the border
 lekin pakistan ko ye baari pad rahaa he, kyonki pichley teen hafton main golibari ke dauraan bhartiya javaanon ne 10 pakistan sainikon ko dher kiya
 The soldiers of India have taken this action in retaliation
 bataa den ki pakistan ko is masale par kootnithik taur par har jagah haar mil rahi he, na sanyukt raashtra or na hi america-rus jaise bade desh kashmir maamle main dakhal dene kii uski guhaar ko sun rahe hai
 Therefore, Pakistan is constantly taking such steps, so that the attention of the world can come to it
 pakistan ek taraf seemaa par sijafire ko tod rahaa he, to duusari ore pakistan ne belistic missile kaa pareekshan kiya he
 Pakistan has named this missile as Ghaznavi

 In such a situation, the government can give huge subsidy to the people of Delhi
 sabsidi se sarkari khajaane par padegaa baari bojhabsidi yani janata par tex kii maar
 According to an estimate, if the government reduces the electricity rate in half, then the burden of 5000 crore will be increased annually on the treasury
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki ab kejariwal sarkaar sirf unheen logon ko bijli bill par 50 fisadi raahat dene par vichaar kar rahi he jo har maheene 400 unit bijli hi istemaal karte hai
 The decision will not be easy
 It is worth mentioning that in its manifesto, the Aam Aadmi Party promised to reduce the price of electricity by 50 percent
 lekin jaankaron kii maane to pani kii tarah sasti bijli kaa tohfa dena mukhyamantri kejariwal ke liye aasaan nahin hoga

 Congress bid- 'take water to homes' Congress MLA from Seelampur Matin Ahmed has said that only 9 to 10 lakh houses in Delhi have meters, what will happen to the rest of the people
 matin ahamed ne kaha ki kejariwal mukhyamantri hai, kuch bhi kar sakate hai, lekin yojana ko lagu karana badi chunauti he
 Significantly, in a channel sting operation, Matin Ahmed was found on camera saying that his party's support to the AAP is nothing more than a drama
 unhone kaha tha, 'gaaliyaan to pad rahi hai, par majaa bahut aa rahaa he

 relies se pehle hi salmaan khan kii agali film 'prem ratan dhan payo' ne ek nayaa record bana liya he
 It is reported that the music rights of this film have been sold for 17 crores
 agar yah sach he to kisi bhi film ke liye ab tak kaa sabase mahangaa bechaa yaa kharida gaya sangeet he
 By the way, the music rights of big stars movies have huge prices
 film ke gane chaahe bahut achche na hon phir bhi inke ritis oonchi keemton main beche jate hai, kyonki bade sitaron ke hone se mujeec ke prachaar kaa bajet bada hota he or bade paimaane par gaanon kaa pramotion hota he
 The comments film 'prem ratan dhan payo' main salmaan khan ke saath sonam kapur mukhya bhoomika main hai or iskaa sangeet diya he himesh reshmia ne
 The film will have about nine songs
 suraj badjatya or salmaan khan jab-jab ek saath aae hai inkaa mujeec bhi kaamyaab rahaa he
 The music of 'maine Pyaar Kiya', 'hum Aapke Hain Kaun' and 'hum Saath Saath Saath Hain' is still popular and perhaps this is the reason why the music of the film 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' is being given a price of 17 crores
 vaise bade sitaron kii filmon ke mujeec ritis kii badi-badi keemten lagati hai
 Even though the songs of the film are not very good, their rights are sold at high prices, because the music budget is big because of the big stars and promotes the songs on a large scale
 tippaniyan The film 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' stars Salman Khan with Salman Khan in the lead role and music by Himesh Reshammiya

 There has been a continuous uproar in the Lok Sabha for the past 15 days
 ek bhi din sadan kii kaarywahi sucharu rup se nahin chal saki he
 In such a situation, the most senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani has taken up the task of ending the deadlock in the House itself
 adwani loksabhaa main varishthatam saansadon main se ek hai or vipaksh ke netaa bhi unka sammaan karte hai
 Senior BJP leader Advani is unhappy with the continuous uproar in the House
 media reports ke mutabik isi koshish main adwani ne guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa main hangaamaa kar rahe tiares saansad ko apni seat par bulaayaa or unki samasya suni
 TRS mps demand that the reservation limit for government jobs in Telangana be increased by 50 per cent, as provided in states like Tamil Nadu
 isi kram main adwani ne gatirodh khatm karne ko lekar spikar sumitra mahajan se mulaakaat kii or tiares saansad ko bataaya ki spikar sadan ko chalaane kii puri koshish main juty hai
 However, despite this effort, the proceedings of the House could not be conducted on Friday
 yah pehla mauka nahin he jab adwani sadan kii kaarywahi na chalane se naaraaz hai
 In the winter session of 2016, Advani stood up on his seat in the House and said that he was thinking about resigning from the Parliament membership
 unhone sadan na chalaa paane par spikar or sansadeey kaarymantri par apni naaraazgi jaahir kii thi
 Sonia had made the allegations: UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi in the India Today Conclave in the past, accused the Modi government of not ending the deadlock in Parliament
 gatirodh ko baatcheet ke jariye sulajhane ke sawaal par sonia ne kaha ki maujuuda sarkaar ke saath ye mumkin nahin he kyonki is sarkaar ke paas wo jajba hi nahin he
 In Vajpayeeji's government, the deadlock was resolved through dialogue
 unhone kaha ki tab bhi ham vipaksh main the lekin muddon ko baatcheet ke jariye suljhaayaa jaataa tha
 Advani has been the Deputy Prime Minister in the Vajpayee government
 bataa den ki loksabhaa main beete shuukravaar se centre sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav ke notice lagaataar die ja rahe hai lekin hangaame kii vajah se spikar prastaav kaa samarthan kar rahe 50 saansadon kii ginati tak nahin kar paa rahi hai or prastaav ek bhi din nahin rakhe ja sake hai
 mps of TDP, Congress, TRS, AIADMK are creating ruckus in the House on different issues

 mauka he hi - or dastur bhi
 It seems like someone is knocking you in the politics of the country
 philhal bhale hi dhundhlee ho, par do hafte baad - 14 april ko ye tasviir zyada saaf najar aegi, aisa lagata he
 Let's see how much is left for the picture? Challenge the challenges before yogendra-prashant, Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan talk about forming a new party
 nai party main aakhir alag kya hoga? logon ko aisa kya samajhaayaa jayega ki nai party arvind kejariwal ke netritv vaali maujuuda party se alag hogi
 There is no such allegation on Kejriwal that the trust of the people has been lost
 itnaa vakt bhi nahin beetaa ki logon ko ye samajhaayaa ja sake ki jo vaade kiye gaye the ve puure nahin hue
 He was given a stamp of being a fugitive by giving it away even now
 jinhen aap ke raajnneetik panel yaa kaaryakarini se nikaala gaya he unka kahana he ki party main loktantr nahin he
 Opponent voices are not heard in the party
 lokapal ke naam par party bani or uski ab charchaa bhi nahin hoti
 Overturned the party's internal Lokpal from above - and did not give any reason
 lekin kya ye itane bade mudde hai jin kii aam aadmi yani kejariwal ke voter yaa samarthak ko koi phikr he
 If they are from Delhi, they mean things like electricity, water, wi-fi
 isi tarah desh ke duusare hisson main hai to maujuuda system ne uubakar ek badlaav kii ummid lagaae hai
 Now what will Yadav, Bhushan or others who stand with them explain to them about a better alternative? Perhaps the biggest challenge for him will be this
 aisa bhi nahin he ki yogendra yadav in chunautiyon se waakif nahin hai
 Yadav also raises the question, 'it is easy to dream of new politics, it is a challenge to land it
 yah chunauti mere saamne he
 i have to show it dilli main baithkar log kaise odisha, bengal or maharashtra ke bare main faisla kar lete hai?'party to ban jaaegi, cheharaa koun hoga?maan lete hai yogendra-prashanth nai party bana lenge, magar cheharaa koun hoga? wo koun si shakhsiyat hogi jis par log naye sire se bharosa jataayenge? yogendra yadav raajnneeti vigyaan ke achche scollar hai, raajnneeti ko thik se jaanate or samajhate hai
 They also have a good network across the country
 isi tarah prashanth bhushan kii pahchaan ek aise vakil ke taur par he jo sidhe taur par saamaajik sarokaaron se judaa ho or kanoon kii madad se sudhaar laane ke liye sangharshrat ho
 aap's success in the Delhi elections shows that Kejriwal is not just a face, he also has all the merits of organizing a clever and combative politician, skilled strategist and activist with motive
 jaise aam aadmi party bani ek or party ban jaaegi
 Perhaps a better platform can be learned from the past mistakes - but the question of lacquer is that who will be Kejriwal of the new platform? What is yogendra-prashant's preparation? a meeting of is being called
 nai party kyon? yogendra kehete hai, 'yah party ek andolan or bhaavana se paidaa hui he or hamaara kaam is bhaavana or andolan ko aage badhanaa he
 For this, we will call and communicate with workers from across the country and what will be done next will be decided
 ' isamen aap ke asantusht dhade ke logon ke aane kii sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he, masalan - mayank gandhi, anjali damania sahit kai aise log hai jo kejariwal ke taur tareeke se naakhush rahe hai
 Admiral L
 Ramdas, aap's internal Lokpal and leader of Narmada Bachao Andolan, Medha Patkar have also been sent to the meeting
 kya hai teen vikalp?prashanth bhushan ke anusaar unke paas philhal teen vikalp hai jin par ve log aage bad sakate hai
 However, a decision on these will be taken only after discussion with the people in the meeting
 1
 In order to protect the AAP party from Kejriwal and his supporters, the Election Commission or the court may be approached
 2
 To create something politically capable of saving those aims and principles for which the AAP was formed
 3
 Instead of a new political party, the mass movement should be carried forward - and fight for things like land rights, changes in the system in which the positive energy of the activists can be used
 aam aadmi party kii neenv ke taur par andolan kii shuruuaat karne ke liye kejariwal ko bhi ek chehre kii jarurat thi
 Armed with the Raman Magsaysay Award and the struggle for the Right to Information Act, Kejriwal had his own identity
 phir bhi aam janamanas ko andolan se jodne or ek jagah jutaney ke liye ye sab naakaafi the
 Then Kejriwal put forward Anna to launch the movement
 badalte halaat main aage chal kar kejariwal khud cheharaa ban kar ubhare
 Now who will be the new Kejriwal? Will yogendra-prashant himself, or Anna again or anyone else? The problem that was faced by Kejriwal at some time, today Yogendra and Prashant are also in the same situation

 ) beete weekend tii-siries ke daftar main sargarmi kaa maahaul rahaa
 This is because singer Guru Randhawa revealed that he did not want to sing Manmohini for Karanvir Bohra's film Hum Tumse Pyaar Kisa
 maaloom ho ki karanvir bohara ne film hamen tumse pyaar kitna se bade parde par debyue kiya he
 The film released at the box office last Friday
 tii-siries ne bade utsaah ke saath manamohini song soshal media par launch kiya or iske kuch hi ghanton ke baad sabhi post delit kar di gayi
 This song sung by Guru Randhawa is not available on youtube
 film shuukravaar ko relies hui thi or guru kaa bayaan aane ke baad mekars ke paas sirf 4 din the gane ko dobaaraa record karke final draft taiyaar karne ke liye
 However, he somehow managed to do it
 aakhri vakt par mika singh ne baat sanbhali or vah tii-siries ke liye sevier banakar saamne aae
 The problem for the T-series was even greater because Kanika Kapoor also had a voice in the duet Song sung by Guru
 ab iskaa sidhaa matlab ye tha ki tii-siries ko dobaaraa kanika kapur se sampark karnaa tha or gane unase bhi dobaaraa record karana tha
 Luckily Kanika did not leave the city till then
 sirf tii-siries nahin balki isse jude nirdeshak, produsar or baaki kru ne bhi shoot puraa ho jane ke baad raahat kii saans lee
 Both the producers and the directors were angry at Guru Randhawa's decision to quit on the last occasion, giving a condition that seemed too irrational and wrong to the makers
 pyaar or pampring vaala koi bhi tarika guru par kaam nahin kiya kyonki vah maanane ko taiyaar nahin the
 As far as the Guru's response is concerned, he has not yet responded to the matter
 karanvir kii film kii baat karen to vah isse pehle kuch filmon main saporting or said rolls kar chuke hai
 He has worked in films like Kismet Connection and Patel's Punjabi Shaadi and now he has appeared in the lead role in Hum Tumse Pyaar Kisa

 The Congress president, despite promising to form an effective and strong Lokpal Bill on behalf of his government, has lashed out at the Hazare-side for creating a ruckus on the issue, saying that 'just speeches' or 'point fingers at others' 'corruption cannot be eradicated'
 sonia kii in tippaniyon par kejariwal ne vaktavy jari kar kaha, ‘ham sonia gandhi ke vaktavy kaa swaagat karte hai
 We sincerely hope that the government will honor his (sonia's) commitment to create a strong and effective Lokpal
 
 
 sarkaar kii ore se bhi mahaj bhaashanbaaji paryaapt nahin hogi
 "UPA Chairperson Sonia said in Uttarakhand's gauchar-chamoli," Everyone knows that the Prime Minister and our party have repeatedly said that we are in favor of an effective and strong Lokpal Bill
 yah vidheyak sansad main pesh hoga or ham us par amal karaayenge
 Despite this, why is this commotion happening? ’ udhar, hazaare ke andolan kii kor samiti ke sadsy sanjay singh ne congress adhyaksh kii in tippaniyon par aitraaj jataate hue kaha ki bhrashtachar se sirf bhaashanon ke jariye nahin nipta ja saktaa
 Singh had conducted a survey on the issue of Lokpal in Sonia's constituency Rae Bareli
 sanjay singh ne kaha, ‘yah kanoon sangharsh ke jariye banaaya ja rahaa he
 We have been trusting our leaders for the last 42 years but they have not made laws
 sonia gandhi kah rahi hai ki sirf bhaashanon se bhala nahin hoga
 These days only leaders talk but do not work, that is why we have to get on the streets
 ’unhone kaha, ‘agar unhone kaam nahin kiya or is baar bhi vidheyak paarit nahin kiya to hamen phir sadakon par utarana padegaa
 On Sonia's comment that when the Prime Minister has given assurances, why is there so much uproar on this issue, he alleged that the Government's intentions are not right
 unhone kaha, ‘agar unke iraade thik hote to ve janshikayat nivaaran ke liye alag vidheyak nahin laate

 Prosecution sources said that the bail application of the former Cooperative Minister was rejected by the Chief Judicial Magistrate in-charge Ashutosh Khaitan
 adaalat main aatmasamarpan ke baad singh ne jamaanat arji di thi, jise asweekaar kar diya gaya
 Singh may have to go to jail after the bail application is rejected
 sutron ne bataaya ki bhaajapa ke varisht vidhayak singh ko ram mandir mudde par bhadakaau bhaashan dene ke 19 saal puraane maamle main ek sthaneey adaalat ne 1995 se faraar ghoshit kar diya tha

 Sanjay Dutt's biopic Sanju, on the one hand, has earned Rs 145 crore in 4 days, on the other hand, it is being told by a section to improve the image of Sanjay
 soshal media par sanju ke nirdeshak rajkumaar hiraani ko trol karne waalon ke tark hai ki film main sanjay dutt ko har lihaaj se nirdosh bataaya gaya he
 His image has been cleared
 ek yujar ne likhaa he, "sanju ko ek dost ne drugs kii lat lagaai, mahilaon ke saath sambandh ke liye mahilaayein jimmedaar or gan rakhane ke liye hinduon dwaara dhamkee
 "another tweet reads," This is a three-hour PR run as a film

 It conveniently overlooks a big portion of Sanju's life yet is pretty precise wid mentioning the exact no

 in donon doshiyon ke alaava virendra or sunil kumaar ko pehle hi dakaiti or gangrape kaa doshi tehraakar adaalat dwaara sajaa sunai ja chuki thi
 Apart from these, Raj Pal was declared a declared criminal

 is mahila ke saath rape karne se pehle ye log begumpur ilaake main sthit mandir kaa taala todakar parisar main ghuse, pujari ko peeta or kai chijen lut leen
 According to the prosecution, the incident occurred on the night between 18–19 March 2005, when the priest was sleeping in the temple while his wife, child and four-year-old brother-in-law were sleeping in the accompanying room
 police ne kaha ki raat ko ek baje krish, camel, virendra, sunil or raaj pistolon, banduukon or talavaaron ke saath mandir kaa darwaja todakar vahaan ghuse or pujari se ek lakh rupee kii maang kii

 There he robbed his wife's gold ornaments and gang-raped her
 sunwaayee ke dauraan krish or camel ne khud ko nirdosh bataate hue kaha ki unhen jhuthe maamle main fansaaya ja rahaa he
 However, the court rejected her saying that there was no reason why women and priests implicated her in a false case and forensic evidence also confirmed her involvement in the crime

 guru poornima (guru Purnima) kaa hindu dharm main vishesh mahatv he
 Among Hindus, Guru has the best position
 yahaan tak ki guru kaa darja bhagwaan se bhi upar he kyonki wo guru hi he jo hamen agyanta ke andhkaar se ubarkar sahi maarg kii ore le jaataa he
 This is the reason that Guru Purnima is celebrated with great pomp across the country
 manyata he ki isi din aadiguru, mahabharat ke rachayita or chaar vedon ke vyaakhyaata maharishi krishna dwaipayan vyas yani ki maharishi veda vyas (ved Vyas) kaa janm hua tha
 He was a great Sanskrit scholar
 mahabharat (mahabharat) jaisaa mahakavy unheen kii dein he
 In the 18th chapter of this, Lord Shri Krishna teaches the Gita
 sabhi 18 puraanon kaa rachayita bhi maharishi vedavyas ko mana jaataa he
 He is also credited with dividing the Vedas
 isi kaaran inkaa naam vedavyas padaa tha
 Ved Vyas ji is also called Adiguru hence Guru Purnima is also known as Vyas Purnima
 guru poornima ke din guru kii puja-aradhana karne kaa vidhaan he
 This time there is also a lunar eclipse (lunar Eclipse) on the day of Guru Purnima
 maharishi parashar, satyavati ke prati aakarshith hue bina rah nahin paae
 He requested Satyavati to cross the river
 satyavati ne unhen apni naav main baithne ke liye aamantrit kiya
 After sitting in the boat, Parashar Rishi pleaded before Satyavati, which Satyavati accepted conditionally
 parashar rishi, satyavati ke saath sambhog karnaa chaahate the, jisaki sweekruti dene se pehle satyavati ne unke saamne apni teen sharten rakhin
 Satyavati's first condition was that no one could see her while having sex
 parashar ne is shart ko sweekaar karte hue apni divine shakti se ek dweep kaa nirmaan kiya jahaan ghanaa koharaa tha
 No one could see them within this fog
 satyavati kii duusari shart thi ki uske sharir se aane vaali machhlee kii mahak ke sthaan par phulon kii sugandh aae
 Parashar also accepted this condition by saying 'aastastu' and the smell of fish coming from Satyavati's body was gone
 iske vipareet uski deh phulon kii tarah mahakane lagi
 As a third condition, Satyavati said that when she conceived after cohabitation, her son should not be an ordinary person but a monk, not a fisherman
 satyavati kii yah shart bhi parashar rishi dwaara maan lee gai
 At the same time, Parashar Rishi also gave a boon that even after cohabitation, his virginity will remain
 satyavati or rishi parashar ne kohre se bhare dweep par sambhog kiya
 When the time came, Satyavati gave birth to a son, who was a great scientist at birth
 satyavati or parashar kii santan kaa rang kaala tha, jisaki vajah se uskaa naam krishna rakhaa gaya
 This Krishna later became famous as Veda Vyasa
 krishna jab bade hue tab unhone apni maa se kaha ki jab bhi vah kisi vipatti ke samay unhen yaad karengi, vah upasthit ho jaaenge
 Having said this, he left for the island of Dwaipayan to do penance
 baad main satyavati kaa vivaah hastinapur ke raja shantnu se ho gaya
 Satyavati and Shantanu had two sons, Chitrangad and Vichitravirya
 baad main gandharvon se yuddh karte hue chitrangad kii mrityu ho gai
 After some time, the bizarre semen is married to Ambika and ambalika se ho gai
 Both the queens had no children of bizarre virility and died of tuberculosis
 donon putron kii mrityu ke baad satyavati ko yah bhay sataane laga ki aise to vansh samaapt ho jayega
 Satyavati first urged Bhishma to open the path of child-birth with the queens of Vichitravirya, but Bhishma's vow unhen apni mata kii ajna kaa paalan nahin karne diya
 Satyavati became very disappointed and sad
 aise main unhen apane putr veda vyas kii yaad ai
 Ved Vyas told him that he would support him in any disaster
 apni maa ke kehane par veda vyas ne vichitraveery kii raniyon ke saath niyog kiya, After which Pandu and Dhritarashtra were born
 veda vyas ne vichitraveery kii raniyon, ambika or ambalika ke alaava ek daasi ke saath bhi niyog kii pratha kaa paalan kiya, jiske baad vidura kaa janm hua
 Among the three sons, Vidur was the perfect and prolific son in veda-vedanta
 dwaipayan dweep par jaakar tapasya karne or kaale rang kii vajah se unhen krishna dwaipayan naam diya gaya, jo aage chal kar vedon kaa bhashya karne ke kaaran veda vyas ke naam se prasiddh hue
 Due to the expansion of Vedas, he is also known as Badarayan due to his residence in Ved Vyas and Badrivan
 veda vyas ne chaaro vedon ke vistaar ke saath-saath 18 mahapuraanon tathaa brahmasutra kaa bhi pranayan kiya
 According to Hindu Puranas, Lord Vishnu had expanded the Vedas by taking an avatar in the form of Vyasa

 This is the reason why experts are not surprised to see that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) organized its 'dharma Sansad' in the temple town of Udupi in Karnataka for the first time since 1985
 24 november se yah samagam teen din chalaa
 Even after 32 years, the Ram temple issue in Ayodhya was dominating the agenda
 fark yah tha ki ab vihip maanati he ki vakt uski taraf he
 Key speaker RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat said, "there should be no ambiguity about Ram Janmabhoomi that only Ram temple will be built
" 
 
 unheen pattharon se usee rang-rup main
 
 
 At the hands of those people who have been fighting for it for 20-25 years
 '' unhone kaha ki yah 'hidu samaaj' kii 'ekmaatr ichha' he
 VHP President Pravin Togadia said that "I want to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya and bring a Ram kingdom to India
" '' unhone yah daawa karke gafalat bhi failaai ki is sammelan kii koi 'rajnatik disha' nahin he, jabaki lagbhag har vaktaa ne maujuuda maahaul kii baat kii
 The master of the monastery, who organized this Dharma Sansad, swore in front of more than 2,000 listeners that the Ram temple would be built by 2019: “the atmosphere is favorable
 
 
 isi ke aadhaar par main yah aashwaasan de rahaa hum

 Especially when on 5 December the Supreme Court is going to start hearing the petitions challenging the Allahabad High Court's decision on the disputed site of Ayodhya
 yah ek kism kii chetavanee hi thi ki adaalat main chal rahe vivaad ke baavjood kattar bheed ne 1992 main masjid ko dhaha diya tha
 In 2010, the High Court ruled that the land should be divided into three parts and two-thirds of it handed over to the Hindu parties involved in the case and a third to the Sunni Waqf Board
 teenon hi pakshon ne is faisle ke khilaaf apil kii he
 The Supreme Court suggested that all parties should negotiate and resolve the dispute
 magar isaki to shuruyaat tak nahin hui
 On the other hand, controversy erupted between Shia and Sunni Waqf boards
 shiya vakf board ke chairman saiyad wasim rizvi ne kaha ki ve mandir ke liye jameen chhodie ko taiyaar hai or musalmaan lakhanu main masjid banaaen
 The All India Muslim Personal Law Board and its Shia counterpart rejected the proposal
 yaheen is maamle main art of living foundation ke sansthaapak shri shri ravishankar kii entry hoti he
 In a recent visit to Uttar Pradesh, he said that he can mediate the dispute
 magar unki peshkash ko maamle se jude musalamaanon or hinduon donon ne shaq kii najar se dekha
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath dismissed Ravi Shankar's efforts as a step taken by 'too late'
 udupi main kahi gai baton se yahi saamne aayaa ki zyaadaatar hindu dhade adaalat ke baahar maamle kaa nibatara chaahate hai, kyonki ve maanate hai ki ve molbhav kii majboot sthiti main hai
 Their decision is probably not settled by the court
 magar vihip ke pravaktaa sharad sharma kehete hai, ''maujuuda hakeekat ayodhya main ram mandir ke paksh main hai, isliye adaalat kaa faisla mandir ke paksh main hoga
 VHP is planning public awareness in March next year

 sanyukt raashtra main china ke sthai pratinidhi liyu jeeyi ne beijing ke daawey ko doharaate hue kaha ki pakistan sthit jaish-e-mohammad (jeiem) kaa pramukh masood ajahar aatankwaadi nahin he
 On Friday, after assuming the recurring chairmanship of the Security Council, Liu said Azhar does not meet the Security Council standards set for the terrorist
 is dauraan jab liyu se poocha gaya ki china ne sanyukt raashtra kii pratibandh samiti mewzhar ko aatankvaadighoshit nahin karne ke liye ek tarah se vito kaa istemaal kiya, unhone ne kaha, 'sanyukt raashtra kii pratibandh suchi main kisi vyakti or sanghathan ko tab shaamil kiya jaataa he, jab vah uski sharten puri karata he
 It is the responsibility of all the members of the council to ensure that the conditions are complied with
 'liyu ne nahin diya 'kaise' kaa koi jawabahaalanki, jab unase phir poocha gaya ki ajahar aatankwaadi kaise nahin he to unhone vistaar se varnan nahin kiya
 But Azhar does not meet the conditions of the Security Council set for the terrorist
 gauratlab he ki pathankot vayusena adde par beete janvari main hue hamale ke baad bharat ne masood ajahar ko aantvaadiyon kii suchi main shaamil karne ke liye farvari main sanyukt raashtra pratibandh samiti se aagrah kiya tha
 Pakistan and other countries will have to confiscate Azhar's property after the resolution is passed by members under the UN Rule 1267 in the committee, and ban its movement

 Restriction in the sanctions committee on the part of the permanent member of the Security Council means the use of a veto
 bharat ne china kii roak ko chhipe hue vito kii sangya di he
 Significantly, China has helped the Pakistani terrorist in the sanctions committee for the second time
 pichley saal june main bhi china ne bharat ke prayaas ko tab vifal kar diya tha, jab mumbai hamale ke sutaradhar jacki-ur-rahamaan lakhvi ko pakistan ne reeha kiya tha
 On this, India had demanded action against Pakistan through an anti-terrorism proposal
 mumbai hamale main 166 log maare gaye the
 India has condemned India has condemned the recent action taken by China and accused it of giving support to Pakistan's terrorists
 bharat ke videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa vikaas swaroop ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki yah samaj se pare he, kyonki aatankwaadi gatividhiyon or al kaayda se sambandh rakhane ke liye jeiem par samiti ne 2001 main hi pratibandh laga diya tha
 Subsequently, jem's key leaders, financiers and motivators are technically banned
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath washington kii yatra par gaye swaroop ne bayaan jari kar kaha ki samiti kii kaary pranali mataikyta or gumnami ke siddhant par aadhaarit he, jisase vah aatankwaad se ladane main chaynaatmak drushtikon apanaati he

 lekin ham pakistan sarkaar se donon kii suraksha kii guarantee chaahate hai
 They also want a guarantee that they will not be questioned and harassed during their stay in Pakistan

 When the minister was leaving after addressing the program, some journalism students came close to his vehicle and started asking for his opinion on the free education policy
 college ke chaatr prashanth rathod ne bataaya, ‘‘shiksha mantri vinod tavade ne kaha ki yadi main shiksha kaa kharch bardaasht nahin kar saktaa to mujhe kahin kuch kaam karnaa shuru kar dena chahie, meraa unase sawaal tha ki kya pradesh main muft shiksha niti ho sakati he

 He told PTI on Sunday, "this is a kind of lie that is being spread against me
" maine amravati main kisi chaatr ko giraftaar karne kaa aadesh nahin diya

 unhone kaha, ‘‘mere khilaaf aarope lagane vaale chaatr mujhe haul ke baahar mili the or mujhase kuch sawaal poochne kii koshish kii thi
 They are spreading lies against me
 ’’unhone bataaya, ‘‘kuch chaatr ‘inkulab jindabad’ likhi pumplate ke saath aa gayi or anya chaatro ko vitarit kar rahe the

 simit overon ke cricket main bharat ke mahaan khilaadiyon main shaamil dhoni ko lekar yah ajeeb si sthiti he
 He can win a few matches, he is brilliant with his agility behind the wicket but will it be enough to convince captain Kohli to give him 45 matches to play before the World Cup in Britain
 dhoni ke paksh main jo cheez jaati he vah bharat kaa majboot ballebaaji kram he
 Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan are present in the top order while Lokesh Rahul and Ajinkya Rahane are there to support him and Dhoni will not be required for most of the day
 antim overon main tabadatod ballebaaji ke liye hardik pandya bhi team main shaamil hai
 The comments samasya yah he ki paanchvaan or chatha kram kaaphi mahatvapurn jisamen wicket par tikne kaa adhik samay nahin miltaa
 Dhoni has not been among the players who hit big sixes as soon as he came on the field, but now the problem is that he is not scoring even one or two runs regularly in the beginning which is putting pressure
 kohli haalanki dhoni ke anubhav par nirbhar rah sakate hai
 It is not that the cricketers did not improve their performance after 36 years
 sachin tendulkar ne 2009-11 ke bich test or vanade donon main kuch behtareen paariyaan kheli
 Dhoni has potential and talent
 lekin rishabh pant jaisi yuva pratibha un par dabaav bana rahi he jise mauka milane kaa intjaar he
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The question is whether he can win the match for India at the age of 38 in the 2019 World Cup
 iskaa jawaab sirf dhoni ke paas he
 Dhoni's struggles in batting in recent times have seen his ability as a finisher decline
 lekin agar yah poocha jaae ki kya vah ab bhi sarvshereshth wicketiper or team ke sabase feet khilaadiyon main se ek hai jo iskaa jawaab bhi nishchit taur par haa hoga
 This is a strange situation about Dhoni among the great players of India in limited overs cricket
 vah kuch match jita sakate hai, wicket ke peeche apni chapaltaa se vah shandaar hai lekin kya yah captain kohli ko samajhane ke liye paryaapt hoga ki vah britain main hone vaale worldcup se purv unhen 45 match or khilne kaa mauka de
 What goes in Dhoni's favor is India's strong batting order
 sheersh kram main kohli, rohit sharma, shikhar dhawan maujuud hai jabaki unka saath dene ke liye lokesh rahul or ajinkya rahane hai or aise main adhikansh din dhoni kii jarurat nahin padegi
 Hardik Pandya is also included in the team for batting in the final overs
 tippaniyan The problem is that the fifth and sixth order is very important in which there is not much time to stay on the wicket
 dhoni maidan par utarate hi bade chakke jadne vaale khilaadiyon main shaamil nahin rahe hai lekin ab samasya yah he ki vah ek-do ran bhi shuruyaat main niyamit taur par nahin bana rahe hai jisase dabaav ban rahaa he
 Kohli can however depend on Dhoni's experience
 aisa nahin he ki 36 saal ke baad cricketron ne apane pradarshan main sudhaar nahin kiya
 Sachin Tendulkar played some of the best innings in both Tests and odis between 2009-11
 dhoni ke paas kshamta or pratibha he
 But young talent like Rishabh Pant is putting pressure on him who is waiting for a chance

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar thundered at the Adhikar rally organized at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi to grant special status to Bihar
 nitish kumaar ne centre sarkaar se maang kii bihar ko uskaa haq milanaa chahie kyonki vikaas kaa adhikaar uskaa adhikaar he
 In the beginning of his speech, Nitish Kumar said that this is the first time Biharis have shown their strength in Delhi
 bihar ne pehali baar apana haq maanga he or wo hamen milanaa chahie
 Raising the demand for special status to the state once again, Nitish Kumar said on Sunday that if the norms have to be changed for this, this should also be done
 unhone centre sarkaar par rajya kii 'upeksha' karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Addressing a 'adhikar Rally' at the Ramlila Maidan in the national capital, Delhi, Nitish said, 'if you look at the per capita income, our income is just a little over one-third of the national per capita income of the country
 vikaas par hone vaala prati vyakti kharch rashtriya ausat se kareeb aadha he
 All human development indices are extremely low
 'unhone kaha, 'kya hamen vikaas karne kaa haq nahin he? bihar ko rojgaar srujit karne kaa haq nahin he? hamen vikaas kaa haq he, lekin isaki hameshaa upeksha hui he
 Nitish said that the criteria should be changed to give special state status so that Bihar can develop
 unhone kaha, 'yadi hamen vishesh rajya kaa darja miltaa he to ham bhi viksit rajya ho sakate hai
 We have been told that we do not meet the criteria for getting special state status
 to phir maandand badal dijie
 'first part of Nitish Kumar's speech, Biharis showed strength in Delhi for the first time, we asked for our right: Nitish Kumar: Bihar's Center for Education: Bihar's big contribution to history: People go out to study today
 Our right to development is our right
 Bihar is far behind in every case
 Per capita income is much less than the average of the country
 Development is not our right

 punjab main paraali jalaane se paidaa hone vaale smog ke badal har saal rashtriya rajdhani kshetra (ensiaar) or uttar bharat ke bade hisse main logon kaa saans lenaa dubhar karte hai
 Now Punjab has resorted to an ambitious program, so that about 20 million tonnes of paddy straw left over from the paddy crop every year can be consumed safely
 rajya sarkaar ne chennai kii solid west management form nive ejiniers privet limited ke saath samjhauta kiya he jo 'shunya avshesh technology' kaa istemaal kar samasya paidaa karne vaali paraali yaa bhuse ko zyada urja vaale carbon se bharpoor eendhan (siief), iton or pevar block main badal degaa
 If the mou between the company and the Investment Promotion Bureau of Punjab worked out, farmers in the state would not have to burn paddy straw to prepare the field
 kisaan rabi kii fasal ke liye paraali jalaate hai
 Sr
 Director at Nivea
 ke
 Sivakumar says, "the company will build 100 units where the paddy straw collected from across the state will be processed and placed in around 400 centers in the state
 '' ve bataate hai, ''ham ek nai carbonigeshan-devolatsing process kaa istemaal karenge, jiske liye bharat, europea sangh or uttar america sahit 148 deshon main patent ke liye aavedan kiya gaya he
 Shivkumar said that Nivea is already successfully using this technology to convert municipal solid waste (MSW) into CEF fuel in Chennai
 punjab nivesh beuro ke pramukh rakesh kumaar verma kehete hai ki nive ne apane anuthe agri-rejidu management system ko shuru karne ke liye 10,000 karod ru
 Has pledged to invest
 yah system ab se 10 maheene baad kaam karne lagegaa
 According to Shivkumar and his colleagues, every farmer and farmer organization should get involved before the October 2018 harvest
 nive choubees ghante or saaton din chalane vaali kisaan hotline sthapit karegi or malwa, doaba tathaa maajha ilaake ke fasal chakra ke mutabik, tithi tay kar paraali kii kharid karegi
 This venture will provide employment to about 30,000 people, as the work of the Nivea will require workers to make it to the cluster points by making machinery extraction, harvesting, drying and stubble
 har cluster point main kareeb 50,000 ton paraali rakhane kii kshamta hogi
 Each such center will be constructed on seven acres of land and for this the land will be taken on lease from the local panchayat or people
 haalanki yah badi chunauti hogi kyonki nive ko sari 2 karod ton paraali kheton se hataane ke liye bamushkil ek maheene kaa hi samay milegaa, taaki samay se rabi kii fasal ke liye buvaai ho sake
 For this, the company will charge a nominal 'user charge' per acre
 rajya prashasan ke sutron ke mutabik, yah charge 100 se 500 ru
 Can be per acre
 sawaal uthta he ki nivesh ke liye itani badi rakam (10,000 karod ru
 ) Where will it come from? Sivakumar says, "the money will come from a consortium of private investors from Singapore and Hong Kong who are willing to invest in third world green schemes
" '' nive ne 50 fisadi hissedari aise hi niveshkon ko dene kaa prastaav rakhaa he or company ke ek pratinidhi kaa maananaa he ki ''paisa koi badi samasya nahin he
 "of the technology currently used, the city's solid waste is converted into RDF (refuse-derived fuel) with low calorific value and a large part of it into a garbage dump
 lekin nive kii propritary technology 4,000 se 5,000 kilo calories prati kilogram ke caloriffic vailu vaale siief kaa utpaadan kaa karti he
 Comparatively, the coal used in most thermal power plants has a calorific value of only 2,500 and 40 percent of it comes out as ash
 ardf kaa istemaal to cement plant bhi anichhaa se hi karte hai, jabaki carbon se samrudh eendhan kii kaaphi maang rahati he, kyonki iskaa istemaal cement, aayran or steel, ganna, kaagaj, thermal power plant or methenol yaa ethenol utpaadan jaise tamaam kshetron main hota he
 Chief Minister Amarinder Singh is also supporting this venture considering it a unique green option, but there is still some doubt about it in the administrative foothills of the state
 kai log itane bade paimaane par kaamkaaj kar paane kii nive kii kshamta par andeh jataa rahe hai, kyonki uski maujuuda asset vailu mahaj 32 karod ru
 Is and she is talking about working on a huge 10,000 crore venture in Punjab
 rajya kaa nivesh beuro kah rahaa he ki vah is maamle main puri tarah se satark he, lekin verma kehete hai ki rajya sarkaar ke liye iskaa koi vittiya nihitarth nahin he, kyonki vah sirf company ko punjab main kaamkaaj shuru karne kii sahuuliyat de rahi he
 He said that the jobs created by the project would be a bonus
 '' agar sab kuch sahi rahaa to agle sijan tak dilli main smog ke badal taiyaar karne main punjab kaa yogadan shunya ho saktaa he

 madhyapradesh ke raisen jile main rahane vaale lokentre ne beete saal kapade ke kaarobaar ke liye ek lakh rupee kaa karj liya
 Talking about the present time, Lokendra is able to save only 3 thousand rupees a month for household expenses
 baaki masik kishton or kaarobaar se jude anya kharchon main nikal jaataa he
 Lokendra told India Today, "income is not enough because a bank loan has to be filled
 ghar ke kharche ke liye 2-3 hajaar rupee hi nikal pate hai

 unhone mudra kii tarun category ke tahat 6 lakh kaa karj liya
 Sumit Kumar told India Today- 'earlier i was refused a Mudra loan

 He insisted that i buy the goods first, i will show the bill and only then i will give the money directly to the suppliers

 Sumit said in the tone of the complaint, 'the bank also paid his interest rate 9

 'the big Rashmodi government, which is clearing small debts, faced resentment from employees of public sector banks last month when they staged a protest at Delhi's Jantar Mantar

 The protesting bank employees also alleged that the government was pressurizing them to distribute the loan

 We are asked to provide daily reports with the data on the distributed currency loans

 There is no loan proposal nor payment plan
 'rana ne kaha, 'karj lene vaale sochate hai ki ye unke liye sarkaar kii ore se kisi tohfe kaa hissaa he or unhen ise waapas nahin chukaana he, sarkaar lakshya tay kar detii he jo ki nahin hona chahie
 'according to Rana,' there is a policy flaw in the currency
 isliye log iskaa durupyog karte hai or jab wo difolter ho jate hai to bankers ko pakadaa jaataa he or dandit kiya jaataa he
 'in the opinion of some experts, instead of giving a big push to currency employment generation, it is just an exercise related to accounts

 bhikhu paarekhayah aksar bhula diya jaataa he ki mahatma gandhi kii uplabdhiyaan kis kadar vishaal thim
 It would be good to remember him on the occasion of his 150th birth anniversary
 ve pehle bhartiya the jo bharat ko vaishvik nakshe par laae or akele bhartiya bhi jise duniya bhar main janaa jaataa tha
 He was the first Indian to leave his political mark outside India before India
 ve bharat ke itihaas main logon ko apane peeche golband karne vaale sabase mahaan netaa rahe hai, jo lakhon aadamiyon or khaskar auraton ko saarvajanik jivan main laae
 For a quarter of a century, he was so dominated in Indian politics that whoever bought his displeasure committed political suicide
 ve akele bhartiya, balki vaaki duniya ke, netaa the jisane kai alag-alag staron par jindagi ko chuaa or unamem se harek ke bare main unke paas kehane ke liye kuch na kuch tha, chaahe vah swasthya ho, saaf-safai, bacchon kaa laalan-paalan, naitikta, youniktaa, dharm, arthvyavastha yaa aalaa darje kii raajnneeti
 At the time of independence, for which he fought wholeheartedly, Gandhi was so saddened by the all-round violence that he refused to hoist the national flag and even give the message
 unhone khud ke liye koi bhi rajnatik pad lene se manaa kar diya or apni jindagi ke aakhri do saal sampradayik hinsa ke jakhmon ko bharne main laga die
 Even when there was no strength left in his body, he fasted, walked alone on the stony streets of the villages of Noakhali and pleaded with the victims to show kindness and forgiveness
 haalanki unki jaan ko khatra tha, par unhone suraksha lene se saaf inkaar kar diya or apane aalochakon ko badtareen karne kii chunauti hi nahin balki daavat tak di, jinamein se ek ne aisa kiya bhi
 Although Gandhi had his limitations, he was highly inspiring and instructive in many areas and this makes him one of the greatest people of the 20th century
 gandhi ko apni zyaadaatar vayask jindagi main daman or anyaay jhelana padaa
 One cold night in South Africa, he was thrown out of the train on a cold night, abused by a conductor who slammed him down from the coach, and it was a matter of honor that fellow travelers saved him
 
 pretoria main raashtrapati kruger ke ghar ke saamne se guzarane kii jurrat karne ke liye darban ne unhen laat maari or naalee main gira diya
 In the Transvaal, he was arrested for opposing the 1900 registration law and kept in a prison cell with common criminals who used to make sexual gestures and lewd acts in his presence
 durban main ek naslvaadi shwet bheed ne un par pathar phenke or is kadar maaraa-peeta ki jaan bachaane ke liye unhen najadik ke ek police thane main sharan leni padi or baad main vahaan se police vaale ke bhesh main hi baahar nikal sake
 Gandhi pondered deeply on these and other such experiences and asked why all this oppression and atrocities took place and what was the role of the victim in it
 ve is nattejey par pahunche ki daman ke peedit bhi katai nirdosh nahin the
 Indeed, he had collusion in his repression
 angrejon ne bharatiyon kii hi madad se bharat par hukumat kii
 In the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, Indian soldiers opened fire on their fellow Indians
 gandhi or bhi aage gaye or unhone daleel di ki yah sari takat aakhirkaar peedit kii madad se hi hasil hui, jiske bagaiyr ve khokhale hote
 Since this kind of power was present within ordinary men and women, it was necessary that they show this strength for their freedom and refuse to cooperate with their bosses
 unamem se zyaadaatar dar yaa ghabrahat kii vajah se aisa nahin kar paa rahe the
 While reprimanding the Indians in South Africa, Gandhi said that those who treat themselves like insects should not blame others when they are crushed
 duusare sandarbh main unhone hindustaniyon se yah bhi kaha ki ve 'khud apane khilaaf baghawat karnaa' seekhen
 Courage for Gandhi was tied to self-respect and was of great human qualities
 taumr unki chintaa yah thi ki anyaay ke shikaar logon ke aatm-sammaan ko kaise jagaayen
 As Nehru said, his greatest contribution was that he removed the sheet of fear that held India and gave strength to its fearful and self-conscious people
 ek or kshetra jisamen gandhi ne gahari baaten kahin, ahimsa ke unke aacharan se judaa he
 It was misunderstood by them that non-loss is non-violence
 agar ek jaanavar kisi asaadhya beemaari se mar rahaa he or uski jindagi ke kuch hi ghante baaki hai, to jaanaleva injection dekar uski jindagi ko khatm karnaa prem kaa krity he
 There is violence in it, but it is not a violent act
 jaisaa ki gandhi ne ek baar kaha tha, ahimsa kaa sahi angreji anuwaad 'non-vaayalence' nahin balki 'karunaa' yaa 'pyaar' he
 In many other aspects, Gandhi also expanded and deepened the concept of non-violence
 bhartiya parampara main nuksaan ko is tarah paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jisamen na keval shaareerik nuksaan balki pidaa yaa klesh ke manovaigyanik, naitik or duusare rup bhi shaamil hai
 Gandhi not only accepted this broad definition but also expanded it
 unki raay main koi kisi par goliyaan chalaakar yaa lambey samay tak use jindagi kii buniyadi jaruraton se vanchit rakhkar nuksaan pahunchaa yaa maar saktaa he
 Whether someone is 'killed in one stroke' or 'bit by bit', the result is the same and hence the person involved is guilty of violence
 dusron ko beizzat karnaa, nicha dikhaanaa yaa apamaanit karnaa, aatm-sammaan ko thes pahunchaana, kathor shabd bolnaa, kade faisle thopanaa, gussa or maansik krurta bhi hinsa ke rup hai
 Gandhi's idea of non-violence was based on the practice of Satyagraha, in which the other is replaced by his own suffering
 ise unhone 'aatma kii cheer-faad' kaha tha
 The satyagrahi decides his stand based on what he considers to be a true or just demand, but also leaves open the possibility of changing his views in the light of his struggle
 ve apane virdohi kii behatar pravritiyon ko jagaate the, uski antaratma ko kuredate the, uske dilo-dimag ko kholte the or nyaaysangat samaadhaan kii khoj or prapti main uske sahyog kii maang karte the
 Although Gandhi was a very religious person, he was also the most different from any fundamentalist or fanatic
 aisa isliye tha kyonki unka drudh vishwaas tha ki koi bhi dharm purna nahin he or use khud ko maanviya tark or anubhav kii kasuti par kasnaa hi chahie
 It can never be complete because it is expressed in a particular language, at a particular stage of history and can be interpreted in various ways
 chunki aisa he isliye har dharm sammaan kaa adhikari he
 At the same time, he can learn a lot from others as well and therefore should be courteous to other religions
 khud gandhi ne isaki shandaar misaal pesh karte hue duusare dharmon se, khaskar isiyat se, khulkar udhaar liya or use khubsuurati se hindu dharm main mila liya
 Gandhi's guiding principle was to let sublime ideas come from all directions
 ve apni raksha ke liye deevaaron vaale ghar main to rahanaa chaahate the, par uski khidkiyaan puri khuli rakhkar, taaki vichaaron ke taaja jhonke aate rahen
 In a deeper sense, Gandhi was the first theorist and seeker of multiculturalism or constructive dialogue with cultures
 dharm kii fitrat ko samajhane kaa unka tarika kattarpanth se mahfuj rakhata he or hamaari mushkiljada duniya ke liye behad praasangik he
 Gandhi's idea of political leadership is equally enticing and inspiring
 rashtriya andolan ke netaa hone ke naate ve is baat ko lekar behad satark the ki netaa se kya apekshaayen kii jaati hai or uski takat kii simaaen kya hai
 When he felt that his non-cooperation movement went in the wrong direction and turned violent, he called it a huge mistake like the Himalayas and withdrew
 itihaas main aisa koi doosraa netaa khoj paanaa mushkil he jisane khuleam apni galati maani ho or sudhaar kii koshish kii ho
 Gandhi used to think the same about communal violence, especially between 1946 and 1948
 unhen lagata tha ki unhone is par shaayad paryaapt dhyaan nahin diya he
 Being the one who hurts himself for the smallest wrong decision, Gandhi took personal responsibility for it and gave his life in his fight against violence
 netaa hone ke naate unhen lagata tha ki apane saathiyon se bahut aage kadam nahin badhanaa unka kartavya he, unke soche-samajhe faisle ke khilaaf jane kii to baat hi chhod den
 This was also one of the reasons why he did not go ahead with his half-hearted promise of an 'fast unto death' against the Partition of the country, especially after almost all his senior companions had accepted the Partition
 gandhi kii apni simaaen thim
 As Nehru told Lord Mountbatten, Gandhi was so human that he could not be a saint
 brahmacharya par unke vichaar vishwaas kii pariksha lete the or youniktaa ko pashuvat aaveg maanane kaa unka vichaar isaki samrudh naitik or bhaavnaatmak kshamta ko nazarandaaj kar detaa he
 His belief in the ultimate power of non-violence was naive
 jaisaa ki martin bubar or dusron ne bataaya he ki satyagrah kii disha main unke pehla kadam uthaane se pehle hi naajiyon ne gandhi ko nipta diya hota
 He had a limited understanding of the nature and depth of evil and felt stunned by his presence
 in or aisi hi nijee or darshanik simaaon ke baavjood gandhi ke vichaaron main hamen rasta dikhaane kii kshamta he
 His life, which he called his message, had rare depth and grandeur
 unki 150veen jayanti par hamen kritagyata ke saath unke vichaaron kaa adhyayan karnaa chahie or unki jo bhi gahari baaten hamen praasangik or bharose ke laayak lagen, unase prerana leni chahie
